NEW-YORK, JUNE 1, 1851. No. III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY WILLIAM HERBERT, \"FRANK FORESTER.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe doubt whether the wood-engravers of this country have ever produced\r\na finer portrait than the above of the author of \"The Brothers,\"\r\n\"Cromwell,\" \"Marmaduke Wyvil,\" \"The Roman Traitor,\" \"The Warwick\r\nWoodlands,\" \"Field Sports,\" \"Fish and Fishing,\" &c., &c. It is from\r\none of the most successful daguerreotypes of Brady.\r\n\r\nHENRY WILLIAM HERBERT is the eldest son of the late Hon. and Rev.\r\nWilliam Herbert, Dean of Manchester, and of the Hon. Letitia Allen.\r\nHis father was the second son of the second Earl of Carnarvon, who was\r\nof the nearest younger branch of the house of Pembroke. He was a\r\nmember of Parliament in the earlier part of his life, and being a\r\nlawyer in Doctors' Commons was largely employed on the part of\r\nAmerican shipmasters previous to the war of 1812. At a later period he\r\ntook orders, became Dean of Manchester, was distinguished as a\r\nbotanist, and as the author of many eminent works, especially\r\n\"Attila,\" an epic poem of great power and learning. He died about\r\nthree years ago. His mother was the second daughter of Joshua, second\r\nViscount Allen, of Kildare, Ireland,--closely connected with the house\r\nof Leinster.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert was born in London on the seventh of April, 1807; he was\r\neducated at home under a private tutor till 1819, and then sent to a\r\nprivate school near Brighton, kept by the Rev. Dr. Hooker, at which he\r\nremained one year he was then transferred to Eton, and was at that\r\nschool from April, 1820, till the summer of 1825, when he left for the\r\nuniversity, and entered Caius College, Cambridge, in October. Here he\r\nobtained two scholarships and several prizes,--though not a\r\nhard-reading man, and spending much of his time in field sports--and\r\nhe graduated in the winter of 1829-30, with a distinguished reputation\r\nfor talents and scholarship. In November, 1831, he sailed from\r\nLiverpool for New York, and for the last twenty years he has resided\r\nnearly all the time in this city and at his place near Newark in New\r\nJersey, called the Cedars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn 1832, in connection with the late A. D. Patterson, he started _The\r\nAmerican Monthly Magazine_, nearly one half the matter of which was\r\ncomposed by him. After the first year Mr. Patterson retired from it,\r\nand during twelve months it was conducted by Mr. Herbert alone. On the\r\nconclusion of the second year it was sold to Charles F. Hoffman, Mr.\r\nHerbert continuing to act as a joint editor. At the commencement of\r\nthe fourth year Park Benjamin being associated in the editorship, it\r\nwas contemplated to introduce party politics into the work, and Mr.\r\nHerbert in consequence declined further connection with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBy this time Mr. Herbert had made a brilliant reputation as a scholar\r\nand as an author. In the _American Monthly_ he had printed the first\r\nchapters of _The Brothers, a Tale of the Fronde_, and the entire novel\r\nwas published by the Harpers in 1834, and so well received that the\r\nwhole edition was sold in a few weeks. In 1836 and 1837 he edited _The\r\nMagnolia_, the first annual ever printed in America on the system of\r\nentire originality both of the literary matter, and of the\r\nembellishments, which were all executed by American engravers from\r\nAmerican designs. A considerable portion of the matter for both years\r\nwas furnished by Mr. Herbert. In 1837 the Harpers published his second\r\nnovel, _Cromwell_, which did not sell so rapidly as _The Brothers_,\r\nthough generally praised by the reviewers. It 1840 it was reprinted by\r\nColburn in London, and was eminently successful. In 1843 he published\r\nin New-York and London his third novel, _Marmaduke Wyvil, or the\r\nMaid's Revenge_, a story of the English civil wars, and in 1848 the\r\nmost splendid of his romances, _The Roman Traitor_, founded on the\r\nhistory of Cataline, a work which must be classed with the most\r\nremarkable of those specimens of literary art in which it has been\r\nattempted to illustrate classical scenes, characters, and manners.\r\n\r\nIn romantic fiction, besides the above works, Mr. Herbert has written\r\nfor the magazines of this country and Great Britain tales and sketches\r\nsufficient to make twenty to thirty stout volumes. The subjects of his\r\nbest performances have been drawn from the middle ages and from\r\nsouthern Europe, and they display besides very eminent capacities for\r\nthe historical novel, and a familiarity with the institutions of\r\nchivalry and with contemporary manners hardly equaled in any writer of\r\nthe English language.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Mr. Herbert commenced in the New-York _Turf Register_ a series\r\nof papers, under the signature of \"Frank Forester,\" from which have\r\ngrown _My Shooting Box, The Warwick Woodlands, Field Sports of the\r\nUnited States and British Provinces_, and _Fish and Fishing in the\r\nUnited States and British Provinces_--works which by the general\r\nconsent of the sporting world are second to none in their department,\r\nin any of the qualities which should distinguish this sort of writing.\r\nThe principal distinction between these and all other sporting works\r\nlies in this, that such works in general treat only of game in the\r\nfield and flood, and the modes of killing it, while these are in great\r\npart natural histories, containing minute and carefully digested\r\naccounts of every specie of game, beast, bird, and fish, compiled from\r\nAudubon, Wilson, Giraud, Godman, Agassiz, De Kay, and other\r\nauthorities, besides long disquisitions into their habits, times of\r\nmigration, breeding, &c., from the personal observation and experience\r\nof the author. Any person is at once enabled by them to distinguish\r\nbetween any two even closely allied species, and to adopt the proper\r\nnomenclature, with a knowledge of the reason for it. The sporting\r\nprecepts are admitted, throughout the western country especially, to\r\nbe superior to all others, as well as the papers relating to the\r\nbreaking and the kennel and field management of dogs, &c. The same may\r\nbe said of what he has written of guns and gunnery. Mr. Herbert has\r\nhunted, shot, and fished during the last twenty years in every state\r\nof the Union, from Maine to Maryland, south of the great lakes, and\r\nfrom below Quebec to the Sault St. Marie northward of them. Not having\r\nvisited the southern or south western states, the accounts of sporting\r\nin those regions are collected from the writings or oral\r\ncommunications of their best sportsmen, and on these points much\r\nvaluable new information, especially as to the prairie shooting and\r\nthe sports of the Rocky Mountains, will be contained in the new\r\nedition of the _Field Sports_ to appear in the coming autumn.\r\n\r\nBesides his contributions to romantic and sporting literature, Mr.\r\nHerbert has written largely in criticism, he has done much as a poet,\r\nand his capacities in classical scholarship have been illustrated by\r\nsome of the finest examples of Greek and Latin translation that have\r\nappeared in our time. In the aggregate his works would now make\r\nscarcely less than fifty octavo volumes.\r\n\r\nAs we have intimated, the portrait at the beginning of this article is\r\nremarkably good. Mr. Herbert is about five feet ten high, of athletic\r\nhabits, and an untiring and fast walker; fond, of course, of all field\r\nsports, especially horsemanship and shooting, and priding himself upon\r\nkilling as much if not more game than any other gentleman in the\r\ncountry out of New-York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRENTON FALLS\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a story called _Edith Linsey_, written by Mr. WILLIS, soon after he\r\nleft college, occurs the following description of Trenton Falls:\r\n\r\n     \"Trenton Falls is rather a misnomer. I scarcely know what\r\n     you would call it, but the wonder of nature which bears the\r\n     name is a tremendous torrent, whose bed, for several miles,\r\n     is sunk fathoms deep into the earth--a roaring and dashing\r\n     stream, so far below the surface of the forest in which it\r\n     is lost, that you would think, as you come suddenly upon the\r\n     edge of its long precipice, that it was a river in some\r\n     inner world (coiled within ours, as we in the outer circle\r\n     of the firmament,) and laid open by some Titanic throe that\r\n     had cracked clear asunder the crust of this 'shallow earth.'\r\n     The idea is rather assisted if you happen to see below you,\r\n     on its abysmal shore, a party of adventurous travellers;\r\n     for, at that vast depth, and in contrast with the gigantic\r\n     trees and rocks, the same number of well-shaped pismires,\r\n     dressed in the last fashions, and philandering upon your\r\n     parlor floor, would be about of their apparent size and\r\n     distinctness.\r\n\r\n     \"They showed me at Eleusis the well by which Proserpine\r\n     ascends to the regions of day on her annual visit to the\r\n     plains of Thessaly--but with the _genius loci_ at my elbow\r\n     in the shape of a Greek girl as lovely as Phryne, my memory\r\n     reverted to the bared axle of the earth in the bed of this\r\n     American river, and I was persuaded (looking the while at\r\n     the _feroniere_ of gold sequins on the Phidian forehead of\r\n     my Katinka) that supposing Hades in the centre of the earth,\r\n     you are nearer to it by some fathoms at Trenton. I confess I\r\n     have had, since my first descent into those depths, an\r\n     uncomfortable doubt of the solidity of the globe--how the\r\n     deuse it can hold together with such a crack in its bottom!\r\n\r\n     \"It was a night to play Endymion, or do any Tomfoolery that\r\n     could be laid to the charge of the moon, for a more\r\n     omnipresent and radiant atmosphere of moonlight never\r\n     sprinkled the wilderness with silver. It was a night in\r\n     which to wish it might never be day again--a night to be\r\n     enamored of the stars, and bid God bless them like human\r\n     creatures on their bright journey--a night to love in, to\r\n     dissolve in--to do every thing but what night is made\r\n     for--sleep! Oh heaven! when I think how precious is life in\r\n     such moments; how the aroma--the celestial bloom and flower\r\n     of the soul--the yearning and fast-perishing enthusiasm of\r\n     youth--waste themselves in the solitude of such nights on\r\n     the senseless and unanswering air; when I wander alone,\r\n     unloving and unloved, beneath influences that could inspire\r\n     me with the elevation of a seraph, were I at the ear of a\r\n     human creature that could summon forth and measure my\r\n     limitless capacity of devotion--when I think this, and feel\r\n     this, and so waste my existence in vain yearnings--I could\r\n     extinguish the divine spark within me like a lamp on an\r\n     unvisited shrine, and thank Heaven for an assimilation to\r\n     the animals I walk among! And that is the substance of a\r\n     speech I made to Job as a sequitur of a well-meant remark of\r\n     his own, that 'it was a pity Edith Linsey was not there.' He\r\n     took the clause about the 'animals' to himself, and I made\r\n     an apology for the same a year after. We sometimes give our\r\n     friends, quite innocently, such terrible knocks in our\r\n     rhapsodies!\r\n\r\n     \"Most people talk of the _sublimity_ of Trenton, but I have\r\n     haunted it by the week together for its mere loveliness. The\r\n     river, in the heart of that fearful chasm, is the most\r\n     varied and beautiful assemblage of the thousand forms and\r\n     shapes of running water that I know in the world. The soil\r\n     and the deep-striking roots of the forest terminate far\r\n     above you, looking like a black rim on the inclosing\r\n     precipices; the bed of the river and its sky-sustaining\r\n     walls are of solid rock, and, with the tremendous descent of\r\n     the stream--forming for miles one continuous succession of\r\n     falls and rapids--the channel is worn into curves and\r\n     cavities which throw the clear waters into forms of\r\n     inconceivable brilliancy and variety. It is a sort of half\r\n     twilight below, with here and there a long beam of sunshine\r\n     reaching down to kiss the lip of an eddy or form a rainbow\r\n     over a fall, and the reverberating and changing echoes:--\r\n\r\n        \"Like a ring of bells whose sound the wind still alters,\"\r\n\r\n     maintain a constant and most soothing music, varying at\r\n     every step with the varying phase of the current. Cascades\r\n     of from twenty to thirty feet, over which the river flies\r\n     with a single and hurrying leap (not a drop missing from the\r\n     glassy and bending sheet), occur frequently as you ascend;\r\n     and it is from these that the place takes its name. But the\r\n     falls, though beautiful, are only peculiar from the dazzling\r\n     and unequaled rapidity with which the waters come to the\r\n     leap. If it were not for the leaf which drops wavering down\r\n     into the abysm from trees apparently painted on the sky, and\r\n     which is caught away by the flashing current as if the\r\n     lightning had suddenly crossed it, you would think the vault\r\n     of the steadfast heavens a flying element as soon. The spot\r\n     in that long gulf of beauty that I best remember is a smooth\r\n     descent of some hundred yards, where the river in full and\r\n     undivided volume skims over a plane as polished as a table\r\n     of scagliola, looking, in its invisible speed, like one\r\n     mirror of gleaming but motionless crystal. Just above, there\r\n     is a sudden turn in the glen which sends the water like a\r\n     catapult against the opposite angle of the rock, and, in the\r\n     action of years, it has worn out a cavern of unknown depth,\r\n     into which the whole mass of the river plunges with the\r\n     abandonment of a flying fiend into hell, and, reappearing\r\n     like the angel that has pursued him, glides swiftly but with\r\n     divine serenity on its way. (I am indebted for that last\r\n     figure to Job, who travelled with a Milton in his pocket,\r\n     and had a natural redolence of 'Paradise Lost' in his\r\n     conversation.)\r\n\r\n     \"Much as I detest water in small quantities (to drink), I\r\n     have a hydromania in the way of lakes, rivers, and\r\n     waterfalls. It is, by much, the _belle_ in the family of the\r\n     elements. _Earth_ is never tolerable unless disguised in\r\n     green. _Air_ is so thin as only to be visible when she\r\n     borrows drapery of water; and _Fire_ is so staringly bright\r\n     as to be unpleasant to the eyesight; but water! soft, pure,\r\n     graceful water! there is no shape into which you can throw\r\n     her that she does not seem lovelier than before. She can\r\n     borrow nothing of her sisters. Earth has no jewels in her\r\n     lap so brilliant as her own spray pearls and emeralds; Fire\r\n     has no rubies like what she steals from the sunset; Air has\r\n     no robes like the grace of her fine-woven and ever-changing\r\n     drapery of silver. A health (in wine!) to WATER!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n     \"Who is there that did not love some stream in his youth?\r\n     Who is there in whose vision of the past there does not\r\n     sparkle up, from every picture of childhood, a spring or a\r\n     rivulent woven through the darkened and torn woof of first\r\n     affections like a thread of unchanged silver? How do you\r\n     interpret the instinctive yearning with which you search for\r\n     the river-side or the fountain in every scene of nature--the\r\n     clinging unaware to the river's course when a truant in the\r\n     fields in June--the dull void you find in every landscape of\r\n     which it is not the ornament and the centre? For myself, I\r\n     hold with the Greek: \"Water is the first principle of all\r\n     things: we were made from it and we shall be resolved into\r\n     it.\"\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOf subsequent visits to this loveliest of spots, years after, Mr.\r\nWillis has given descriptions in letters addressed to General Morris\r\nfor publication in the _Home Journal_, and we are soon to have from\r\nPutnam in a beautiful volume all that he has written on the subject,\r\ntogether with notices of the manner in which he enjoyed himself at Mr.\r\nMoore's delightful hotel at the Falls, which is represented as\r\nfarthest of all summer resorts from the turmoil of the world and\r\nnearest of all to the gates of Paradise. We borrow from these letters\r\na few characteristic and tempting paragraphs:\r\n\r\n     \"I was here twenty years ago, but the fairest things slip\r\n     easiest out of the memory, and I had half forgotten Trenton.\r\n     To tell the truth, I was a little ashamed, to compare the\r\n     faded and shabby picture of it in my mind with the reality\r\n     before me, and if the waters of the Falls had been, by any\r\n     likelihood, the same that flowed over when I was here\r\n     before, I should have looked them in the face, I think, with\r\n     something of the embarrassment with which one meets,\r\n     half-rememberingly, after years of separation, the ladies\r\n     one has vowed to love for ever.\r\n\r\n     \"The peculiarity of Trenton Falls, I fancy, consists a good\r\n     deal in the space in which you are compelled to see them.\r\n     You walk a few steps from the hotel through the wood, and\r\n     come to a descending staircase of a hundred steps, the\r\n     different bends of which are so over-grown with wild\r\n     shrubbery, that you cannot see the ravine till you are\r\n     fairly down upon its rocky floor. Your path hence, up to the\r\n     first Fall, is along a ledge cut out of the base of the\r\n     cliff that overhangs the torrent, and when you go to the\r\n     foot of the descending sheet, you find yourself in very\r\n     close quarters with a cataract--rocky walls all round\r\n     you--and the appreciation of power and magnitude, perhaps,\r\n     somewhat heightened by the confinement of the place--as a\r\n     man would have a much more realizing sense of a live lion,\r\n     shut up with him in a basement parlor, than he would of the\r\n     same object, seen from an elevated and distant point of\r\n     view.\r\n\r\n     \"The usual walk (through this deep cave open at the top) is\r\n     about half a mile in length, and its almost subterranean\r\n     river, in that distance, plunges over four precipices in\r\n     exceedingly beautiful cascades. On the successive rocky\r\n     terraces between the falls, the torrent takes every variety\r\n     of rapids and whirlpools, and, perhaps, in all the scenery\r\n     of the world, there is no river, which, in the same space,\r\n     presents so many of the various shapes and beauties of\r\n     running and falling water. The Indian name of the stream\r\n     (the Kanata, which means the _amber river_) expresses one of\r\n     its peculiarities, and, probably from the depth of shade\r\n     cast by the two dark and overhanging walls 'twixt which it\r\n     flows, the water is everywhere of a peculiarly rich lustre\r\n     and color, and, in the edges of one or two of the cascades,\r\n     as yellow as gold. Artists, in drawing this river, fail,\r\n     somehow, in giving the impression of _deep-down-itude_ which\r\n     is produced by the close approach of the two lofty walls of\r\n     rock, capped by the overleaning woods, and with the sky\r\n     apparently resting, like a ceiling, upon the leafy\r\n     architraves.... If there were truly, as the poets say\r\n     figuratively, \"worlds _within_ worlds,\" this would look as\r\n     if an earthquake had cracked open the outer globe, and\r\n     exposed, through the yawning fissure, one of the rivers of\r\n     the globe below--the usual underground level of \"down among\r\n     the dead men,\" being, as you walk upon its banks, between\r\n     you and the daylight.\r\n\r\n     \"Considering the amount of surprise and pleasure which one\r\n     feels in a walk up the ravine at Trenton, it is remarkable\r\n     how little one finds to say about it, the day after. Is it\r\n     that mere scenery, without history, is enjoyable without\r\n     being suggestive, or, amid the tumult of the rushing torrent\r\n     at one's feet, is the milk of thought too much agitated for\r\n     the cream to rise? I fancied yesterday, as I rested on the\r\n     softest rock I could find at the upper end of the ravine,\r\n     that I should tumble you out a letter to-day, with ideas\r\n     pitching forth like saw-logs over a waterfall; but my memory\r\n     has nothing in it to-day but the rocks and rapids it took\r\n     in--the talent wrapped in its napkin of delight remaining in\r\n     unimproved _statu-quo_-sity. One certainly gets the\r\n     impression, while the sight and hearing are so overwhelmed,\r\n     that one's mind is famously at work, and that we shall hear\r\n     from it to-morrow; but it is Jean Paul, I think, who says\r\n     that 'the mill makes the most noise when there is no grist\r\n     in the hopper.'\r\n\r\n     \"We have had the full of the moon and a cloudless sky for\r\n     the last two or three nights, and of course we have walked\r\n     the ravine till the 'small hours,' seeing with wonder the\r\n     transforming effects of moonlight and its black shadows on\r\n     the falls and precipices. I have no idea (you will be glad\r\n     to know) of trying to reproduce these sublimities on\r\n     paper--at least not with my travelling stock of verbs and\r\n     adjectives. To 'sandwich the moon in a muffin,' one must\r\n     have time and a ladder of dictionaries. But one or two\r\n     effects struck me which perhaps are worth briefly naming,\r\n     and I will throw into the lot a poetical figure, which you\r\n     may use in your next song....\r\n\r\n     \"The fourth Fall, (or the one that is flanked by the ruins\r\n     of a saw-mill) is, perhaps, a hundred feet across; and its\r\n     curve over the upper rock and its break upon the lower one,\r\n     form two parallel lines, the water everywhere falling the\r\n     same distance with the evenness of an artificial cascade.\r\n     The stream not being very full, just now, it came over, in\r\n     twenty or thirty places, thicker than elsewhere; and the\r\n     effect, from a distance, as the moonlight lay full upon it,\r\n     was that of twenty or thirty immovable marble columns\r\n     connected by transparent curtains of falling lace, and with\r\n     bases in imitation of foam. Now it struck me that this might\r\n     suggest a new and fanciful order of architecture, suitable\r\n     at least to the structure of green-houses, the glass roofs\r\n     of which are curved over and slope to the ground with very\r\n     much the contour of a waterfall....\r\n\r\n     \"Subterranean as this foaming river looks by day, it looks\r\n     like a river in cloud-land by night. The side of the ravine\r\n     which is in shadow, is one undistinguishable mass of black,\r\n     with its wavy upper edge in strong relief against the sky,\r\n     and, as the foaming stream catches the light from the\r\n     opposite and moonlit side, it is outlined distinctly on its\r\n     bed of darkness, and seems winding its way between hills of\r\n     clouds, half black, half luminous. Below, where all is deep\r\n     shadow except the river, you might fancy it a silver mine\r\n     laid open to your view amid subterranean darkness by the\r\n     wand of an enchanter, or (if you prefer a military trope, my\r\n     dear General), a long white plume laid lengthwise between\r\n     the ridges of a cocked hat.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW PROOF OF THE EARTH'S ROTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The earth does move, notwithstanding,\" whispered Galileo, leaving the\r\ndungeon of the Inquisition: by which he meant his friends to\r\nunderstand, that if the earth did move, the fact would remain so in\r\nspite of his punishment. But a less orthodox assembly than the\r\nconclave of Cardinals might have been staggered by the novelty of the\r\nnew philosophy. According to Laplace, the apparent diurnal phenomena\r\nof the heavens would be the same either from the revolution of the sun\r\nor the earth; and more than one reason made strongly in favor of the\r\nprevalent opinion that the earth, not the sun, was stationary. First,\r\nit was most agreeable to the impression of the senses; and next, to\r\ndisbelieve in the fixity of the solid globe, was not only to eject\r\nfrom its pride of place our little planet, but to disturb the\r\nlong-cherished sentiment that we ourselves are the centre--the be-all\r\nand end-all of the universe. However, the truth will out; and this is\r\nits great distinction from error, that while every new discovery adds\r\nto its strength, falsehood is weakened and at last driven from the\r\nfield. That the earth revolves round the sun, and rotates on its polar\r\naxis, have long been the settled canons of our system. But the\r\nrotation of the earth has been rendered _visible_ by a practical\r\ndemonstration, which has drawn much attention in Paris and London, and\r\nis beginning to excite interest in this country. The inventor is M.\r\nFoucault; and the following description has been given of the mode of\r\nproof:\r\n\r\n     \"At the centre of the dome of the Pantheon a fine wire is\r\n     attached, from which a sphere of metal, four or five inches\r\n     in diameter, is suspended so as to hang near the floor of\r\n     the building. This apparatus is put in vibration after the\r\n     manner of a pendulum. Under and concentrical with it is\r\n     placed a circular table, some twenty feet in diameter, the\r\n     circumference of which is divided into degrees, minutes,\r\n     &c., and the divisions numbered. Now, supposing the earth to\r\n     have the diurnal motion imputed to it, and which explains\r\n     the phenomena of day and night, the plane in which this\r\n     pendulum vibrates will not be affected by this motion, but\r\n     the table, over which the pendulum is suspended, will\r\n     continually change its position, in virtue of the diurnal\r\n     motion, so as to make a complete revolution round its\r\n     centre. Since, then, the table thus revolves, and the\r\n     pendulum which vibrates over it does not revolve, the\r\n     consequence is, that a line traced upon the table by a point\r\n     projecting from the bottom of the ball will change its\r\n     direction relatively to the table from minute to minute and\r\n     from hour to hour, so that if such point were a pencil, and\r\n     that paper were spread upon the table, the course formed by\r\n     this pencil would form a system of lines radiating from the\r\n     centre of the table. The practised eye of a correct\r\n     observer, especially if aided by a proper optical\r\n     instrument, may actually see the motion which the table has\r\n     in common with the earth, under the pendulum between two\r\n     successive vibrations. It is, in fact, apparent that the\r\n     ball, or rather the point attached to the bottom of the\r\n     ball, does not return precisely to the same point of the\r\n     circumference of the table after two successive vibrations.\r\n     Thus is rendered visible the motion which the table has in\r\n     common with the earth.\"\r\n\r\nCrowds are said to flock daily to the Pantheon to witness this\r\ninteresting experiment. It has been successfully repeated by Professor\r\nAnsted at the Russell Institution, in London, in a manner similar to\r\nthe experiment at the Pantheon at Paris. The wire, which suspended a\r\nweight of twenty-eight pounds, was of the size of the middle C-string\r\nof a piano. It was thirty feet long, and vibrated over a graduated\r\ntable fixed to the floor. The rotation of the table, implying that of\r\nthe earth on which it rested, was visible in about five minutes, and\r\nthe wonderful spectacle was presented of the rotation of the room\r\nround the pendulum. The experiment excited the astonishment of every\r\nbeholder, and many eminent scientific gentlemen who were present\r\nexpressed their great delight in witnessing a phenomenon which they\r\nconsidered the most satisfactory they had witnessed in the whole\r\ncourse of their lives.\r\n\r\nAlthough nothing, to minds capable of comprehending it, can add to the\r\nforce or clearness of the demonstration by which the rotation of the\r\nearth has been established, yet even the natural philosopher himself\r\ncannot regard the present experiment without feelings of profound\r\ninterest and satisfaction; and to the great mass, to whom the\r\ncomplicated physical phenomena by which the rotation of the earth has\r\nbeen established are incomprehensible, M. Foucault's very ingenious\r\nillustration is invaluable.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the Newark _Daily Advertiser_ appears to have\r\nanticipated the experiment of M. Foucault, suspending a fifty-six\r\npound weight by a small wire from the rafters of a barn. But however\r\nsimple and conclusive the illustration, it should be attempted only by\r\nscientific men. Professor Sylvester, writing to the _Times_, of\r\nexperiments made in London, says:\r\n\r\n     \"The experiments connected with the practical demonstration\r\n     of the phenomenon require to be conducted with great care;\r\n     and some discredit has been brought upon attempts to\r\n     illustrate it in England by persons who have not taken the\r\n     necessary precautions to protect the motion from the\r\n     excentric deviation to which it is liable, and which may,\r\n     and indeed must, have the effect of causing, in some cases,\r\n     an apparent failure, and in others a still more unfortunate,\r\n     because fallacious, success. I believe, from the character\r\n     of the persons connected with the experiments, that the true\r\n     phenomenon has been accurately produced and observed in\r\n     Paris. I doubt whether as much can be said, with entire\r\n     confidence, of any of the experiments hitherto performed\r\n     here in London.\r\n\r\n     \"Any want of symmetry in the arrangements for the suspension\r\n     of the wire, or in the centering of the weight, exposure to\r\n     currents of air, or the tremulous motion occasioned by the\r\n     passage of vehicles, may operate to cause a phenomenon to\r\n     be brought about curious enough in itself, as a result of\r\n     mathematical laws, but quite different from that supposed.\r\n     The phenomenon of the progression of the apsides of an oval\r\n     orbit, which is here alluded to, is familiar to all students\r\n     in mechanics.\r\n\r\n     \"It is perfectly absurd for persons unacquainted with\r\n     mechanical and geometrical science to presume to make the\r\n     experiment. Indeed, such efforts deserve rather the name of\r\n     conjuring than of experiment; but in this, as in many other\r\n     matters of life, it is true that \"fools rush in where angels\r\n     fear to tread.\" Perhaps the too hasty rush at the\r\n     experimental verification of Foucault's law may account for\r\n     some persons in England, whose opinions when given with due\r\n     deliberation are entitled to respect, having allowed\r\n     themselves to express doubts (which I understand, however,\r\n     have been since retracted) as to the truth of the law\r\n     itself. In Paris there was no difference of opinion among\r\n     such men as Lame, Poinsol, Binet, Leonville, Sturm, Chasles,\r\n     Bruvues, I believe Arago, Hermite, and many others with whom\r\n     I conversed on the subject, except as to the best mode of\r\n     making the theory popularly intelligible.\"\r\n\r\nExplanations will be necessary from lecturers and others who give\r\nimitations of M. Foucault's ingenuity to render it intelligible to\r\nthose unacquainted with mathematics, or with the laws of gravity and\r\nspherical motion. For instance, it will not be readily understood by\r\nevery one why the pendulum should vibrate in the same plane, and not\r\npartake of the earth's rotation in common with the table; but this\r\ncould be _shown_ with a bullet suspended by a silkworm's thread. Next,\r\nthe apparent horizontal revolution of the table round its centre will\r\nbe incomprehensible to many, as representative of its own and the\r\nearth's motion round its axis.\r\n\r\nDoubtless we shall soon have public exhibitions of the demonstration\r\nin all our cities.\r\n\r\nThe pendulum is indeed an extraordinary instrument, and has been a\r\nuseful handmaid to science. We are familiar with it as the\r\ntime-regulator of our clocks, and the ease with which they may be made\r\nto go faster or slower by adjusting its length. But neither this nor\r\nthe Pantheon elucidation constitutes its sole application. By it the\r\nlatitude may be approximately ascertained, the density of the earth's\r\nstrata in different places, and its elliptical eccentricity of figure.\r\nThe noble Florentine already quoted was its inventor; and it is\r\nrelated of Galileo, while a boy, that he was the first to observe how\r\nthe height of the vaulted roof of a church might be measured by the\r\ntimes of the vibration of the chandeliers suspended at different\r\naltitudes. Were the earth perforated from London to our antipodes, and\r\nthe air exhausted, a ball dropped through would at the centre acquire\r\na velocity sufficient to carry it to the opposite side, whence it\r\nwould again descend, and so oscillate forward and backwards from one\r\nside of the globe's surface to the other in the manner of a pendulum.\r\nVery likely, the Cardinals of the Vatican would deem this heresy, or\r\n\"flat blasphemy.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUTCHERS' LEAP AT MUNICH.\r\n\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the London _Athenaeum_, writing from Munich, gives\r\nthe following account of the festival of the Butchers' Leap in the\r\nFountain: \"This strange ceremonial, like the _Schaeffler Tanz_, is said\r\nto have its origin in the time of the plague. While the Coopers danced\r\nwith garlands and music through the streets, the Butchers sprang into\r\nthe fountain in the market-place, to show their fellow-citizens that\r\nits water was no longer to be dreaded as poisoned. Perhaps they were\r\nthe Sanitary Commissioners of those days; and by bathing themselves in\r\nthe water and dashing it about on the crowd would teach the true means\r\nof putting pestilence to flight.\r\n\r\n     \"Though the Coopers' Dance takes place only once in seven\r\n     years, the Butchers' Leap occurs annually, and always on\r\n     _Fasching Montag_,--the Monday before Shrove Tuesday. I\r\n     believe the ceremony is of great importance to the trade of\r\n     the Butchers; as certain privileges granted to them are\r\n     annually renewed at this time, and in connection with the\r\n     Leap. These two ceremonies--of the Coopers' Dance and the\r\n     Butchers' Leap--are now almost the last remains of the\r\n     picturesque and quaint customs of old Munich.\r\n\r\n     \"The Butchers commence proceedings by attending High Mass in\r\n     St. Peter's Church,--close to the Schrannien Platz, or\r\n     market-place, in which the fountain is situated. It is a\r\n     desolate-looking church, this St. Peter's, as seen from\r\n     without,--old, decaying, and ugly; within, tawdry\r\n     and--though not desolate and decaying--ugly. From staringly\r\n     white walls frown down on the spectator torture-pictures,\r\n     alternating with huge gilt images of sentimental saints in\r\n     clumsy drapery. The altars are masses of golden clouds and\r\n     golden cherubs.\r\n\r\n     \"Music, as from the orchestra of a theatre rather than from\r\n     the choir of a church, greeted us as we entered. The\r\n     Butchers were just passing out. We caught glimpses of\r\n     scarlet coats; and saw two huge silver flagons, covered with\r\n     a very panoply of gold and silver medals, borne aloft by\r\n     pompous officials clothed in scarlet. Having watched the\r\n     procession--some half-dozen tiny butchers' sons, urchins of\r\n     five and six years old, with rosy, round faces and chubby\r\n     hands, mounted on stalwart horses and dressed in little\r\n     scarlet coats, top-boots, and jaunty green velvet\r\n     hats--seven butchers' apprentices, the Leapers of the day,\r\n     also dressed in scarlet and mounted on horseback--the\r\n     musicians,--the long train of master-butchers and journeymen\r\n     in long dark cloaks and with huge nosegays in their\r\n     hats--and the scarlet officials bearing the decorated\r\n     flagons,--having watched, I say, all these good folk wend\r\n     their way in long procession up the narrow street leading\r\n     from the church, and seen them cross the market-place in the\r\n     direction of the Palace, where they are awaited by the\r\n     King,--let us look around, and notice the features of the\r\n     market-place:--for it is, in fact, a quaint old bit of the\r\n     city, and well worth a glimpse.\r\n\r\n     \"If I love the Ludwig Strasse as the most beautiful portion\r\n     of the new Munich, I almost equally love the Schrannien\r\n     Platz as about the quaintest part of old Munich. It is long\r\n     and narrow as a market-place, but wide as a street. The\r\n     houses are old; many of them very handsome, and rich with\r\n     ornamental stucco-work,--\r\n\r\n        'All garlanded with carven imageries\r\n        Of fruit and flowers and bunches of knot-grass.'\r\n\r\n     The roofs are steep, red tiled, and perforated with rows of\r\n     little pent-house windows. The fronts of the houses are of\r\n     all imaginable pale tints,--stone colors, pinks, greens,\r\n     greys, and tawnies. Three of the four corners of the\r\n     market-place are adorned with tall pepper-box towers, with\r\n     domed roofs and innumerable narrow windows. At one end is\r\n     the fountain; and in the centre a heavy, but quaint\r\n     shrine,--a column supporting a gilt figure of the Madonna.\r\n     The eye wanders down various picturesque streets which open\r\n     into the market-place; and on one hand, above steep roofs,\r\n     gaze down the two striking red-brick towers of the _Frauen\r\n     Kirche_--the cathedral of Munich:--those two red towers\r\n     which are seen in all views of this city, and which belong\r\n     as much to Munich as the dome of St. Paul's does to the city\r\n     of London,--those towers which in the haze of sunset are\r\n     frequently transformed into violet-tinted columns, or about\r\n     which in autumn and winter mists cling with a strange\r\n     dreariness as if they were desolate mountain peaks!\r\n\r\n     \"But the quaintest feature of all in the Schrannien Platz is\r\n     a sort of arcade which runs around it. Here, beneath the low\r\n     and massy arches, are crowded thick upon each other a host\r\n     of small shops. What queer, dark little cells they are,--yet\r\n     how picturesque! Here is a dealer in crucifixes,--next to\r\n     him a woollen-draper, displaying bright striped woollen\r\n     goods for the peasants,--then a general dealer, with heaps\r\n     and bundles and tubs and chests containing every thing most\r\n     heterogeneous,--and next to him a dealer in pipes. There are\r\n     bustle and gloom always beneath these heavy low arches,--but\r\n     they present a glorious bit of picturesque life. There are\r\n     queer wooden booths, too, along one portion of the\r\n     Schrannien Platz where it rather narrows, losing its\r\n     character of market-place, and descending to that of an\r\n     ordinary street. But the booths do not degenerate in their\r\n     picturesque character. The earthenware booths--of which\r\n     there are several--are truly delicious. Such rows and piles\r\n     of dark green, orange, ruddy chocolate-brown, sea-green,\r\n     pale yellow, and deep blue and grey vessels of all forms and\r\n     sizes--all quaint, all odd--jugs, flagons, pipkins, queer\r\n     pots with huge lids, queer tripods for which I know no\r\n     name--things which always seem to me to come out of a\r\n     witch's kitchen, but by means of which I suspect that my own\r\n     dinner is cooked every day. All these heaps of crockery lie\r\n     about the doors, and load the windows of the wooden booths,\r\n     and line shelves and shelves within the gloom of the little\r\n     shops themselves. When I first came here these old crockery\r\n     shops were a more frequent study to me than any thing else\r\n     in the old town.\r\n\r\n     \"We ascended a steep, narrow staircase leading out of this\r\n     arcade into one of the houses above it, from which we were\r\n     to witness the leaping into the fountain. I looked out of\r\n     the window on the crowd that began to collect around the\r\n     fountain, and noticed the tall roofs and handsome fronts of\r\n     the houses opposite, and the crowd of pigeons--scores and\r\n     scores of pigeons--assembled just opposite the fountain on\r\n     the edge of the steep roof which rose like a red hill-side\r\n     behind them. They seemed solemnly met to witness the great\r\n     festivities about to be celebrated, and sat in silent\r\n     expectation brooding in the sunshine. Then, I wondered what\r\n     attraction the icy water could have for the children who\r\n     leaned over the fountain's side--dabbling in the water as\r\n     though it had been midsummer. The crowd increased and\r\n     increased; and seven new white buckets were brought and\r\n     placed on a broad plank which extended across one side of\r\n     the fountain basin.\r\n\r\n     \"A shout from the crowd announced the arrival of the\r\n     Butchers. First of all came the tender Butcher-infants, in\r\n     scarlet coats, top-boots, and green velvet hats, borne in\r\n     the arms of their fathers through the crowd in order that\r\n     they might witness the fun. Then followed the scarlet\r\n     officials:--and then came seven of the queerest beasts man\r\n     ever set eyes on. What were they, if human? Were they seven\r\n     Esquimaux chiefs, or seven African mumbo-jumbos? They were\r\n     the heroes of the day--the seven Butcher-apprentices,\r\n     clothed in fur caps and garments--covered from shoulder to\r\n     heel with hundreds of dangling calves' tails--red, white,\r\n     black, dun!\r\n\r\n     \"You may imagine the shouts that greeted them,--the peels of\r\n     laughter. Up they sprang on the broad plank,--leaping,\r\n     dancing, making their tails fly round like trundled mops.\r\n     The crowd roared with laughter. A stately scarlet\r\n     official--a butcher (_Altgesell_)--stands beside them on the\r\n     plank. Ten times they drink the health of the royal family\r\n     and prosperity to the butchers' craft. The _Altgesell_ then\r\n     striking many blows on the shoulder of the nearest\r\n     apprentice, frees him and all the remaining six from their\r\n     indentures. They are henceforth full-grown butchers. Then,\r\n     they plunge into the very centre of the fountain with a\r\n     tremendous splash. The crowd shout,--the startled pigeons\r\n     wheel in wild alarm above the heads and laughter of the\r\n     crowd. The seven Tritons dash torrents of water on the\r\n     multitude,--who fly shrieking and laughing before the\r\n     deluge. The seven buckets are plied with untiring\r\n     arms;--lads are enticed within aim by showers of nuts flung\r\n     by the 'Leapers,' and then are drenched to the skin. It is a\r\n     bewilderment of water, flying calves' tails, pelting nuts,\r\n     and shrieking urchins.\r\n\r\n     \"The 'Leapers' then ascend out of their bath,--shake\r\n     themselves like shaggy dogs,--have white cloths pinned round\r\n     their necks as though they were going to be shaved,--and\r\n     have very grand medals hung round their necks suspended by\r\n     gaudy ribbons.\r\n\r\n     \"The procession retires across the market-place to its\r\n     '_Herberge_,' and the crowd disperses,--but disperses only\r\n     to re-assemble in various public-houses for the merriment of\r\n     the afternoon and night. That night and the next day are\r\n     'the maddest, merriest of all the year.' Music is every\r\n     where--dancing every where. It is the end of the Carnival.\r\n     Ash Wednesday comes,--and then, all is gloom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGLECT OF THE PRESERVATION OF EGYPTIAN ANTIQUITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA writer in the London _Athenaeum_, writing from Alexandria, endeavors\r\nto convince those who profess an interest in Egyptian antiquities,\r\nthat if their present neglect continues, nothing will remain of the\r\nstupendous relics now lying over the land, but a quantity of\r\npulverized fragments. The colossal statue at Memphis, said to belong\r\nto the British Museum, for years depended on the precarious protection\r\nof an old Arab woman, who was continually expecting and claiming a\r\nsmall salary of five or six pounds per annum as guardian. She received\r\nabout so much from a variety of consuls, for a time, but the payment\r\nwas at last discontinued, and, from what was told her, she based her\r\nhopes on the learned or the powerful in England. \"But the learned and\r\nthe powerful never, I suppose,\" says the writer, \"heard of her, and\r\nshe died, leaving the statue in charge of her son, who, in his turn,\r\nseems to live in hope. There is little prospect of his getting any\r\nthing, however; and very probably, in spite of his unrewarded zeal,\r\nthe magnificent statue--by far the finest in Egypt--will ere long be\r\nburnt for lime. The neighboring pyramid of Dashour is being, as I have\r\nalready said, worked as a quarry, and I shall be very much surprised\r\nif this handy block of stone escape notice.\" He suggests the formation\r\nof a committee, consisting of the principal consuls and residents in\r\nEgypt, to watch over the preservation of the monuments of the country,\r\nand to be supplied, by governments or by the voluntary contributions\r\nof the learned, with the funds necessary to pay guardians and\r\ninspectors.\r\n\r\nA very valuable museum of Egyptian antiquities we believe is now on\r\nthe way to the United States; but it embraces no such great works as\r\nhave been transported to Rome and Paris. Is it not worth while for the\r\nNew-York merchants to set up in Union or Washington Square, the great\r\nstatue of Memphis?\r\n\r\nOr it would not be altogether inappropriate for the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution to have it imported into Washington. How much the\r\ndiffusion of \"knowledge\" would be promoted by such a movement it is\r\nnot easy to say: but a figure of this kind on Capitol Hill would have\r\nsuch an effect on our eloquence! and our juvenile poets could go there\r\nand in its shade invoke the presence of twenty centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY ROWE SCHOOLCRAFT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Schoolcraft is of English descent by the paternal side, his\r\ngreat-grandfather having come from England during the wars of Queen\r\nAnne, and settled in what is now Schoharie county in New-York, where\r\nin old age he taught the first English school in that part of the\r\ncountry, from which circumstance his name was not unnaturally changed\r\nby the usage of the people from Calcraft to Schoolcraft. Our author\r\nrecently attempted in his own person to revive the old family name,\r\nbut soon abandoned it, and concluded to retain that which was begotten\r\nupon his native soil, and by which he has long been so honorably\r\ndistinguished. He is a son of Colonel Lawrence Schoolcraft, who joined\r\nthe revolutionary army at seventeen years of age, and participated in\r\nthe movements under Montgomery and Schuyler, and the memorable defence\r\nof Fort Stanwix under Gansevoort. He was born in Guilderland, near\r\nAlbany, on the twenty-eighth of March, 1793. In a secluded part of the\r\ncountry, where there were few advantages for education, and scarce any\r\npersons who thought of literature, he had an ardent love of knowledge,\r\nand sat at home with his books and pencils while his equals in age\r\nwere at cock-fights and horse-races, for which Guilderland was then\r\nfamous. He is still remembered by some of the octogenarians of the\r\nvillage as the \"learned boy.\" At thirteen he drew subjects in natural\r\nhistory, and landscapes, which attracted the attention of the late\r\nLieutenant-Governor Van Rensselaer, then a frequent visitor of his\r\nfather, through whose agency he came near being apprenticed to one\r\nAmes, the only portrait-painter at that time in Albany; but as it was\r\ndemanded that he should commence with house-painting the plan was\r\nfinally abandoned. At fourteen he began to contribute pieces in prose\r\nand verse to the newspapers, and for several years after he pursued\r\nwithout aid the study of natural history, English literature, Hebrew,\r\nGerman, and French, and the philosophy of language.\r\n\r\nMr. Schoolcraft's first work was an elaborate treatise, but partially\r\nknown to the public, entitled Vitreology, which was published in 1817.\r\nThe design of it was to exhibit the application of chemistry to the\r\narts in the fusion of siliceous and alkaline substances in the\r\nproduction of enamels, glass, etc. He had had opportunities of\r\nexperimenting largely and freely by his position as conductor for a\r\nseries of years of the extensive works of the Ontario Company at\r\nGeneva in New-York, the Vermont Company at Middlebury and Salisbury in\r\nVermont, and the foundry of crystal glass at Keene in New Hampshire.\r\nIn 1818, and the following year, he made a geological survey of\r\nMissouri and Arkansas to the spurs of the Rocky Mountains, and in the\r\nfall of 1819 published in New-York his View of the Lead Mines of\r\nMissouri, which is said by Professor Silliman to have been \"the only\r\nelaborate and detailed account of a mining district in the United\r\nStates\" which had then appeared. It attracted much attention, and\r\nprocured for the author the friendship of many eminent men. In the\r\nsame year he printed Transallegania, a poetical _jeu d'esprit_ of\r\nwhich mineralogy is the subject, and which preceded some clever\r\nEnglish attempts in the same vein. It was republished in London by Sir\r\nRichard Phillips in the next year.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1820 he published a Journal of a Tour in the Interior of\r\nMissouri and Arkansas, extending from Potosi toward the Rocky\r\nMountains. His writings having attracted the notice of the government,\r\nhe was commissioned by Mr. Calhoun, then Secretary of War, to visit\r\nthe copper region of Lake Superior, and to accompany General Cass in\r\nhis expedition to the head waters of the Mississippi. His Narrative\r\nJournal of this tour was published in 1821, and was eminently\r\nsuccessful, an edition of twelve hundred copies being sold in a few\r\nweeks. In the same year he was appointed secretary to the commission\r\nfor treating with the Indian tribes at Chicago, and on the conclusion\r\nof his labors published his sixth work, entitled Travels in the\r\nCentral Portions of the Mississippi Valley, in which he described the\r\ncountry between the regions of which he had given an account in his\r\nprevious works. His reputation was now widely and firmly established\r\nas an explorer, and as a man of science and letters. From this time\r\nhis attention was devoted principally to the Red Race, though he still\r\ncultivated natural history, and wrote occasionally for the reviews and\r\nmagazines.\r\n\r\nIn 1822 he was appointed by President Monroe agent for Indian Affairs,\r\nto reside at St. Mary's, at the foot of Lake Superior. In the years\r\n1825, 1826, and 1827, he attended the important convocations of the\r\nnorth-west tribes at Prairie du Chien, Pont du Lac, and Buttes des\r\nMorts. In 1831 he was sent on a special embassy, accompanied by\r\ntroops, to conciliate the Sioux and Ojibwas, and bring the existing\r\nwar between them to a close. In 1832 he proceeded in the same capacity\r\nto the tribes near the head waters of the Mississippi, and availed\r\nhimself of the opportunity to trace that river, in small canoes, from\r\nthe point where Pike stopped in 1807 and Cass in 1820 to its true\r\nsource in Itasca Lake, upon which he entered on the thirteenth of\r\nJuly, the one hundred and forty-ninth anniversary of the discovery of\r\nthe mouth of the river by La Salle. His account of this tour was\r\npublished in New-York in 1834, under the title of An Expedition to\r\nItasca Lake, and attracted much attention in all parts of the country.\r\n\r\nFrom 1827 to 1831 Mr. Schoolcraft was a member of the legislative\r\ncouncil of Michigan. In 1828 he organized the Michigan Historical\r\nSociety, in which he was elected president, on the removal of General\r\nCass to Washington, in 1831. In the fall of the same year he set on\r\nfoot the Algic Society at Detroit, before which he delivered a course\r\nof lectures on the grammatical construction of the Indian\r\nlanguages,[1] and at its first anniversary a poem on The Indian\r\nCharacter. Guided by patriotism and good taste, he took a successful\r\nstand in the west against the absurd nomenclature which has elsewhere\r\nmade such confusion in geography by repeating over and over the names\r\nof European places and characters, giving us Romes, Berlins, and\r\nLondons in the wilderness, and Hannibals, Scipios, Homers, and\r\nHectors, wherever there was sufficient learning to make its possessors\r\nridiculous. He submitted to the legislature of the territory a system\r\nof county and township names based upon the Indian vocabularies with\r\nwhich he was familiar, and happily secured its general adoption.\r\n\r\nAt Sault Ste. Marie Mr. Schoolcraft became acquainted with Mr. John\r\nJohnston, a gentleman from the north of Ireland, who had long resided\r\nthere, and in the person of his eldest daughter married a descendant\r\nof the hereditary chief of Lake Superior, or Lake Algoma, as it is\r\nknown to the Indians. She had been educated in Europe, and was an\r\naccomplished and highly interesting woman. After a residence there of\r\neleven years he removed to Michilimackinac, and assumed the joint\r\nagency of the two districts. In 1836 he was appointed by President\r\nJackson a commissioner to treat with the north-west tribes for their\r\nlands in the region of the upper lakes, and succeeded in effecting a\r\ncession to the United States of some sixteen millions of acres. In the\r\nsame year he was appointed acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs for\r\nthe Northern Department, and in 1839 principal disbursing agent for\r\nthe same district.\r\n\r\nIn the last mentioned year he published two volumes of Algic\r\nResearches, comprising Indian Tales and Legends, and soon after,\r\nhaving passed more than twenty years as a traveller or resident on the\r\nfrontiers, he removed to the city of New-York, intending to prepare\r\nfor the press the great mass of his original papers which he had\r\naccumulated in this long period. In 1841 he issued proposals for an\r\nIndian Cyclopedia, geographical, historical, philological, etc., of\r\nwhich only one number was printed, no publisher appearing willing to\r\nundertake so costly and extensive a work of such a description. In\r\n1842 he visited England, France, Germany, Prussia, and Holland. During\r\nhis absence his wife died, at Dundee, in Canada West, where she was\r\nvisiting her sister. Soon after his return he made another journey to\r\nthe west, to examine some of the great mounds, respecting which he has\r\nsince communicated a paper to the Royal Geographical Society of\r\nDenmark, of which he was many years ago elected an honorary member,\r\nand soon after published a collection of his poetical writings, under\r\nthe title of Alhalla, or the Lord of Talladega, a Tale of the Creek\r\nWar, with some miscellanies, chiefly of early date. In 1844 he\r\ncommenced in numbers the publication of Oneota, or the Red Race in\r\nAmerica, their History, Traditions, Customs, Poetry, Picture Writing,\r\netc., in extracts from Notes, Journals, and other unpublished\r\nwritings, of which one octavo volume has been completed. In 1845 he\r\ndelivered an address before a society known as the \"Was-ah\r\nHo-de-no-sonne, or New Confederacy of the Iroquois,\" and published\r\nObservations on the Grave Creek Mound in Western Virginia, in the\r\nTransactions of the American Ethnological Society; and early in the\r\nfollowing year presented in the form of a Report to the legislature of\r\nhis native state, his Notes on the Iroquois, or Contributions to the\r\nStatistics, Aboriginal History, and General Ethnology of Western\r\nNew-York.\r\n\r\nThe last and most important of Mr. Schoolcraft's works, the crowning\r\nlabor of his life, for the composition of which all his previous\r\nefforts were but notes of preparation, is the Historical and\r\nStatistical Information respecting the History, Condition, and\r\nProspects of the Indian Tribes of the United States: Collected and\r\nprepared under the Direction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, per act\r\nof March 3, 1847. The initial volume of this important national\r\npublication, profusely illustrated with engravings from drawings by\r\nCaptain Eastman, of the Army, has lately been issued in a very large\r\nand splendid quarto, by Lippincott. Grambo & Co., of Philadelphia,\r\nunder authority of Congress. It embraces the general, national, and\r\ntribal history of the Indian race, with their traditions, manners,\r\ncustoms, languages, mythology, &c., and when completed will probably\r\nextend to six or seven volumes. Until more of it is published, it will\r\nnot be possible to form any exact judgment of it, except such as is\r\nwarranted by a knowledge of the author's previous works: but such a\r\njudgment must be in the highest degree favorable.\r\n\r\nMr. Schoolcraft's ethnological writings are among the most important\r\ncontributions that have been made to the literature of this country.\r\nHis long and intimate connection with the Indian tribes, and the\r\nknowledge possessed by his wife and her family of the people from whom\r\nthey were descended by the maternal side, with his power of examining\r\ntheir character from the European point of view, have enabled him to\r\ngive us more authentic and valuable information respecting their\r\nmanners, customs, and physical traits, and more insight into their\r\nmoral and intellectual constitution, than can be derived, perhaps,\r\nfrom all other authors. His works abound in materials for the future\r\nartist and man of letters, and will on this account continue to be\r\nread when the greater portion of the popular literature of the day is\r\nforgotten. With the forests which they inhabited, the red race have\r\ndisappeared with astonishing rapidity. Until recently they have rarely\r\nbeen the subjects of intelligent study; and it began to be regretted,\r\nas they were seen fading from our sight, that there was so little\r\nwritten respecting them that had any pretensions to fidelity. I would\r\nnot be understood to undervalue the productions of Eliot, Loskiel,\r\nHeckewelder, Brainerd, and other early missionaries, but they were\r\nrestricted in design, and it is not to be denied that confidence in\r\ntheir representations has been much impaired, less perhaps from doubts\r\nof their integrity than of their ability and of the advantages of the\r\npoints of view from which they made their observations. The works on\r\nIndian philology by Roger Williams and the younger Edwards are more\r\nvaluable than any others of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,\r\nbut it now appears that these authors knew very little of the\r\nphilosophy of the American language. Du Ponceau's knowledge was still\r\nmore superficial, and excepting Mr. Gallatin and the late Mr.\r\nPickering, who made use of the imperfect data furnished by others, I\r\nbelieve no one besides Mr. Schoolcraft has recently produced any thing\r\non the subject worthy of consideration. Something has been done by\r\nGeneral Cass, and Mr. McKenny and Mr. Catlin have undoubtedly\r\naccomplished much in this department of ethnography; but allowing all\r\nthat can reasonably be claimed for these artist-travellers, Mr.\r\nSchoolcraft must still be regarded as the standard and chief authority\r\nrespecting the Algic tribes.\r\n\r\nThe influence which the original and peculiar myths and historical\r\ntraditions of the Indians is to have on our imaginative literature,\r\nhas been recently more than ever exhibited in the works of our\r\nauthors. The tendency of the public taste to avail itself of the\r\nAmerican mythology as a basis for the exhibition of \"new lines of\r\nfictitious creations\" has been remarked by Mr. Schoolcraft himself in\r\nOneota, and he refers to the tales of Mrs. Oakes Smith, and to the\r\nWild Scenes in the Forest and the Prairie, and the Vigil of Faith, by\r\nMr. Charles F. Hoffman, as works in which this tendency is most\r\ndistinctly perceptible. In the writings of W. H. C. Hosmer, the\r\nlegends of Mr. Whittier, and some of the poems of Mr. Longfellow and\r\nMr. Lowell, we see manifestations of the same disposition.\r\n\r\nNo one who has not had the most ample opportunities of personal\r\nobservation should attempt to mould Indian life and mythology to the\r\npurposes of fiction without carefully studying whatever Mr.\r\nSchoolcraft has published respecting them. The chief distinction of\r\nthe Algic style with which he has made us acquainted is its wonderful\r\nsimplicity and conciseness, with which the common verbosity, redundant\r\ndescription, false sentiment, and erroneous manners of what are called\r\nIndian tales, are as little in keeping as \"English figures in\r\nmoccasins, and holding bows and arrows.\"\r\n\r\nThe excellent portrait at the beginning of this article is from a\r\ndaguerreotype by Simons, of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Two of these lectures were published in 1834, translated into\r\nFrench by the late Mr. du Ponceau, and subsequently read before the\r\nNational Institute of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARGRAVINE OF ANSPACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death, in London, a few weeks ago, of a daughter of the celebrated\r\nLady Craven, afterwards Margravine of Anspach, has recalled attention\r\nto the history of that remarkable and celebrated person, whose life\r\nhas the interest of a romance.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH BERKELEY, Margravine of Anspach, was born in December, 1750.\r\nShe was the daughter of Augustus, fourth Earl of Berkeley, by his wife\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Henry Drax of Charborough. She was brought up\r\nunder the care of a native of Switzerland, the wife of a German tutor\r\nof her uncle. She describes herself as having been a delicate,\r\ndiminutive child, addicted at an early age to reading, and of timid\r\nand retired habits. She first beheld a play when she was twelve years\r\nold, and from that occasion she dates the growth of her subsequent\r\npartiality for theatrical entertainments. At the age of thirteen she\r\npaid a short visit to France with her mother and her elder sister, and\r\nat fourteen she had been, as she says she afterwards discovered, \"in\r\nlove without knowing it\" with the Marquis de Fitz James. On the 10th\r\nMay, 1767, she was married to William Craven, nephew and heir of the\r\nfifth Lord Craven, whom he succeeded in 1769. She professes to have\r\nfelt indifference when receiving his addresses, but the marriage was\r\nfor some time a happy one, and she says, \"My husband seemed to have no\r\nother delight than in procuring for me all the luxuries and enjoyments\r\nwithin his power, and it was an eternal dispute (how amiable a\r\ndispute!) between us; _he_ always offering presents, and _I_ refusing\r\nwhenever I could.\" Gifted with genius and beauty, both of which she\r\nknew well how to apply; a woman of Lady Craven's rank naturally drew\r\naround her a large circle of admirers. She says of herself very\r\ncharacteristically, \"In London the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough\r\nshowed their partiality to me, and Mr. Walpole, afterwards Lord\r\nOrford, Dr. Johnson, Garrick, and his friend Colman, were among my\r\nnumerous admirers; and Sir Joshua Reynolds did not conceal his high\r\nopinion of me. Charles Fox almost quarrelled with me because I was\r\nunwilling to interfere with politics--a thing which I always said I\r\ndetested, and considered as being out of the province of a woman.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been in the year 1779 that Lady Craven discovered\r\nthe infidelities with which she charged her husband, when she\r\nrequested of him the favor \"that he would not permit his mistress to\r\ncall herself Lady Craven.\" After an interval of about three years\r\nspent in partial reconciliation, a separation took place. The\r\nindifferent tone in which she treats the whole of this transaction,\r\nand her professed readiness to overlook every slight that was not\r\npublic and glaring, are a stain on her character, which she has by her\r\nown animated pen exhibited to an age which had forgotten the\r\naccusations to which she was subjected. At the time of her separation\r\nfrom her husband she was the mother of seven children.\r\n\r\nLady Craven had in the mean time produced her first play, \"The\r\nSleepwalker,\" a translation from the French, printed in 1778, at her\r\nfriend Walpole's press at Strawberry Hill. In 1779 she published\r\n\"Modern Anecdotes of the Family of Kinvervankotsprakengatchdern, a\r\nTale for Christmas.\" This was a caricature of the ceremonious\r\npomposity of the petty German courts; it was dramatized by Mr. M. P.\r\nAndrews. Soon after the separation, she passed some time in France,\r\nwhere she met with the Margrave of Anspach. They formed a sudden\r\nfriendship for each other, and agreed to consider each other (we are\r\ntold) as brother and sister. In June, 1785, Lady Craven commenced a\r\ntour, in which, starting from Paris, she passed by the Rhine to Italy,\r\nwent thence by the Tyrol to Vienna, passed on to Warsaw, Petersburg,\r\nand Moscow, proceeded by the Don to Turkey, and returned by Vienna,\r\nwhich she reached in August, 1786. On this occasion she ran, by her\r\nown account, a serious risk of being made Empress of Austria. In 1789\r\nshe published an account of her tour (1 vol. 4to), in letters\r\naddressed to the margrave, saying in the dedication, \"Beside\r\ncuriosity, my friends will in these letters see, at least for some\r\ntime, where the real Lady Craven has been, and where she is to be\r\nfound--it having been the practice for some years past for a\r\nBirmingham coin of myself to pass in most of the inns in France,\r\nSwitzerland, and England, for the wife of my husband. My arms and\r\ncoronet sometimes supporting in some measure this insolent deception;\r\nby which, probably, I may have been seen to behave very improperly.\"\r\nThis work is interesting from the many sketches it contains of eminent\r\npeople--such as the Empress Catharine, the Princess Dashcoff, Prince\r\nPotemkin, Count Romanzoff, Admiral Mordvinoff, the Duc de Choiseul,\r\nand others. It is full of accurate observation and lively description,\r\nexpressed in clear and simple English--a style from which in later\r\nlife she considerably diverged. She descended into the grotto of\r\nAntiparos, being the first female to undertake the adventure. The\r\nFrench biographers maintain that the tameness of her description of\r\nthe scene shows a deficiency of appreciation of the wonderful and\r\nsublime. She does not indeed ornament her description with hyperboles\r\nand exclamations, but it is clear and expressive, and by the\r\ndistinctness of the impression which it conveys to the reader, shows\r\nthat the scene was fully noticed and comprehended by the writer. After\r\nher return from her journey, she visited England to see her children,\r\nand then proceeded to France, where she joined the margrave and\r\naccompanied him to Anspach. Here, during a residence of a few years,\r\nshe established a theatre, which was chiefly supplied with dramatic\r\nentertainments of her own composition. They were collected into two\r\nvolumes 8vo, under the title of \"Nouveau Theatre d'Anspach et de\r\nTriesdorf,\" the latter being the name of a country seat nine miles\r\nfrom Anspach, where she laid out a park and garden in the English\r\nmanner. She established at the same time \"a society for the\r\nencouragement of arts and sciences.\" She soon afterwards visited, in\r\ncompany with the margrave, the congenial court of Naples, where she\r\nmade the acquaintance of Sir William and Lady Hamilton. Her conduct\r\nwas the subject of much censure both in England and among the\r\nofficials of the court of Anspach, to whom her interference was a\r\nnatural subject of distrust; and if it should even be admitted that\r\nher own account of the purity of her motives and conduct is correct,\r\nit cannot be denied that she afforded material for forming the worst\r\ninterpretations of them. She maintains that she always opposed the\r\ncession of his dominions to the crown of Prussia by the margrave in\r\n1791, but she was almost his sole adviser on the occasion. She states\r\nthat she received the first hint of his design at Naples. One day\r\nwhile she was dressing for dinner, a servant intimated that the\r\nmargrave desired to see her. On her appearance he said, \"I must go to\r\nBerlin _incog._--will you go with me? it is the only sacrifice of your\r\ntime I will ever require of you.\" They set out together, and on the\r\nway through Anspach they found the establishment nearly in open revolt\r\nagainst her influence. The king, however, was kind and generous in the\r\nextreme, and the contracting parties are represented as only striving\r\nto excel each other in generosity. Meanwhile the margrave's first wife\r\ndied, and Lord Craven's death occurred six months afterwards, on the\r\n26th September, 1791. Immediately on hearing of this event, Lady\r\nCraven was married to the margrave. \"It was six weeks,\" she says,\r\n\"after Lord Craven's decease that I gave my hand to the margrave,\r\nwhich I should have done six hours after, had I known it at the time.\"\r\nAs the cession of the margraviate to Prussia dates 2d December, 1791,\r\nthe marriage must have taken place about three weeks before it. The\r\nnuptials were solemnized at Lisbon, whence the new married pair passed\r\nthrough Spain and France to England.\r\n\r\nThe margrave, on the sale of his principality, resolved to spend his\r\ndays with his wife in England. They had no sooner arrived, however,\r\nthan the storm of family and public indignation which had been brewing\r\nagainst the margravine burst upon her head. She received a letter from\r\nher three daughters, saying, \"with due deference to the Margravine of\r\nAnspach, the Miss Cravens inform her that, out of respect to their\r\nfather, they cannot wait upon her,\" and her eldest son, Lord Craven,\r\nrefused to countenance her. The margrave received a message from the\r\nqueen, through the Prussian minister, to the effect that his wife,\r\nthough she had received a diploma from the emperor, could not be\r\nreceived at court as a princess of the empire. She says that she\r\nrefused to derogate from her dignity by appearing merely as a peeress\r\nof England; but it is not clear that she would have been received in\r\nthat capacity. She addressed a memorial on the subject to the House of\r\nLords, but they gave her no redress; indeed it would not have been\r\nconsistent with the practice of that body to interfere on such an\r\noccasion. Soon after their arrival, the margrave purchased through\r\ntrustees, Lord Craven's estate of Benham, and the mansion of\r\nBrandenburgh House, a place celebrated as afterwards affording a\r\nretreat to Queen Caroline, the wife of George IV. Until the margrave's\r\ndeath in 1806, it was a scene of continued profusion and gayety, in\r\nwhich the luxuries and amusements of an English mansion were united\r\nwith those of a German court, \"My whole enjoyment,\" says the\r\nmargravine, \"during the margrave's valuable life, was to do every\r\nthing in my power, to make him not only comfortable, but happy. Under\r\nmy management, the world imagined that he spent double his income.\"\r\nHer attachment to her second husband was strong. She speaks of him\r\nwith an enthusiasm and devotion which bear the stamp of sincerity. \"I\r\nbelieve,\" she says, \"a better man never existed. There never was a\r\nbeing who could act upon more sincere principles. Nothing could divert\r\nhim from what was right. None could bear with patience, like himself,\r\nthe ill conduct of those to whom he was attached. None could more\r\neasily forgive.\" After his decease, the margravine, who succeeded to\r\nthe large property which he left, felt impatient to recommence her\r\nwanderings. On the restoration she sailed for France, and, after being\r\ninterrupted in her movements by the reign of the hundred days, reached\r\nRome, where it was said that she kept open house for all the\r\nrevolutionists of all countries who chose to accept her hospitalities.\r\nThe King of Naples afterwards presented her with a small estate, in\r\nwhich she built a palace, where she resided till her death, which\r\noccurred on January 13, 1828. Only two years previously, and when she\r\nwas seventy-six years old, she surprised and delighted the English\r\nworld by the publication of her well-known memoirs. This work is\r\nperhaps one of the best examples of the French memoirs which English\r\nliterature possesses. It is indeed thoroughly French, not only in\r\nspirit but in idiom, and, to the reader, has all the appearance of a\r\ntranslation from that language. It thus affords, in its style, a\r\nremarkable contrast to the book of travels above noticed. It contains\r\na vast variety of anecdotes and sketches of character, always amusing\r\nif not always accurate. It has no continuity of narrative, leaping\r\nbackwards and forwards through all ages, and among every variety of\r\nsubject: from a description of the monument which she erected to the\r\nmemory of her husband, she takes occasion to give a rapid sketch of\r\nthe history of the art of sculpture. The least pleasing feature in the\r\nwork is its intense egotism. The margravine was a woman of\r\nwonderfully versatile genius. She wrote with fluency in French and\r\nGerman. She was an accomplished musician and actress; and she tells\r\nus, \"I have executed many busts myself, and among others one of the\r\nmargrave, which is generally allowed to be extremely like him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON DESCRIBED BY A PARISIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Francis Wey, who is a college professor and _litterateur_ of some\r\neminence in Paris, has published for visitors from the continent to\r\nthe Great Exhibition, a volume entitled _Guides a Londres_, composed,\r\nwe believe, of a series of articles, _Les Anglais chez Eux_ (the\r\nEnglish at Home), which he had contributed to the _Musee des\r\nFamilles_, an old and favorite Parisian journal. It is very amusing to\r\nsee the manner in which these things are received by the British\r\npress. The sensitiveness of which the Americans are accused is quite\r\nequalled in that which is displayed in the London criticisms of\r\nMonsieur Wey. And just at this time it is all the more pleasant to us,\r\nfor that our amiable Mother-Country critics are quoting with so much\r\nenjoyment the characterizations of us poor United-Statesers, done in\r\nthe same way, by a gentleman of the same country. Even _Blackwood_\r\ndoes not seem to have a suspicion that a Frenchman could caricature or\r\nin any way exaggerate the publicities or domesticities of New-York;\r\nbut all the independent, care-for-nothing John Bulls see only\r\n\"rancor,\" \"ill-will,\" and \"absurdity\" in the Frenchman's views of\r\nEnglish society. The _Literary Gazette_, the _Weekly News_, and all\r\nthe rest, have the same tone. French travellers, it is said--\r\n\r\n     \"Instead of patiently collecting their facts, they _invent_\r\n     them. Instead of representing social usages as they really\r\n     are, they state them as what they choose to suppose. They\r\n     mistake flippancy for wit, and imperturbable assurance for\r\n     knowledge. They speak _ex cathedra_ of matters of which they\r\n     are profoundly ignorant. And the consequence of all this is\r\n     that they commit the drollest blunders, make the most\r\n     startling assertions, indulge in the most grotesque\r\n     appreciations, and flounder in the most extravagant\r\n     absurdities.\"\r\n\r\nWe wonder if a single British reviewer will introduce, with such a\r\nparagraph, his extracts from the Letters on America, by M. XAVIER\r\nMARMIER? Not a bit of it.\r\n\r\nOn the English language, M. Wey says--\r\n\r\n     \"The Englishman has invented for himself a language adapted\r\n     to his placid manners and silent tastes. This language is a\r\n     murmur, accompanied by soft hissings; it falls from the\r\n     lips, but is scarcely articulated; if the chest or throat be\r\n     employed to increase the power of the voice, the words\r\n     become changed and scarcely intelligible; if cried aloud,\r\n     they are hoarse, and resemble the confused croaking of frogs\r\n     in marshes.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The English are passionately attached to their language.\r\n     They have only consented to borrow one single word from us,\r\n     and that is employed by their innkeepers--_table d'hote_,\r\n     which they pronounce _taible dott_. And yet we have taken\r\n     hundreds of words from them!\"\r\n\r\nEnglish women--\r\n\r\n     \"English women give to us the preference over their own\r\n     countrymen. Our gallantry is something new to them, and our\r\n     politeness touches their hearts. But though they love us, we\r\n     are not liked by their lords and masters. There is no\r\n     exaggeration in all that has been said of the beauty of\r\n     English women--an assemblage of them would realize the\r\n     paradise of Mahomet.\"\r\n\r\nTheir dresses--\r\n\r\n     \"Many white gowns are to be seen. White is a _recherche_\r\n     luxury in that land of tallow and smoke, where linen becomes\r\n     dirty in three hours. However, good taste is making some\r\n     progress. Ladies may be met with who are well dressed,\r\n     although, generally speaking, a sort of audacity is\r\n     displayed in wearing the most irreconcilable colors. What\r\n     gives English women a somewhat _bizarre_ appearance, is the\r\n     custom they have of swelling out their petticoats, by means\r\n     of circles of whalebone or iron:--this causes them to\r\n     resemble large bells in movement.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish manners--\r\n\r\n     \"English manners, rigid and cold, and dominated by arid\r\n     rationalism, are the work of Cromwell. His bigotry and\r\n     hypocrisy, his exterior austerity, his narrow formalism,\r\n     suit the Englishman; he keeps up Cromwell's character, and\r\n     admires himself in his usages. But he has no pity for his\r\n     model--he never forgives Cromwell for having made him what\r\n     he is. His spite towards that man is the last cry of nature,\r\n     and the vague regret of a liberty of imagination of which\r\n     neither the joys or the aspirations have been known since\r\n     his time.\" \"They have no grace, no _desinvoltura_, no poesy\r\n     in them, but are methodical, reasonable, indefatigable in\r\n     work and in amassing lucre.\"\r\n\r\nHow the English love--\r\n\r\n\"They love nothing with the heart; when they do love, it is\r\nexclusively of the head.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish bankers--\r\n\r\n     \"In France we have the love of display; but in London it is\r\n     not so. There, some of the principal bankers go every\r\n     morning to the butchers' shops to buy their own chops, and\r\n     they carry them ostensibly to some tavern in Cheapside or\r\n     Fleet Street, where they cook them themselves. Then they buy\r\n     three pennyworth of rye-bread, and publicly eat this Spartan\r\n     breakfast. The exhibition fills their clients with\r\n     admiration. But in the evening these good men make up for\r\n     this by taking in their own palaces suppers worthy of\r\n     Lucullus.\"\r\n\r\nFlunkeys--\r\n\r\n     \"The English aristocracy are distinguished by the number,\r\n     the canes, and the wigs of their lacqueys. Seeing constantly\r\n     a footman, well powdered and bewigged, carry horizontally a\r\n     large Voltaire cane behind certain sumptuous carriages, I\r\n     asked for an explanation; it was soon given--wig, powder,\r\n     and cane are aristocratic privileges. Not only must a man\r\n     have a certain number of quarterings to be authorized to\r\n     make his servants use such things, but he must pay so much\r\n     tax for the lacquey, so much for the wig, so much for the\r\n     tail to the wig, and so much for the cane.\"\r\n\r\nWhat most strikes a Frenchman in London--\r\n\r\n\"The coldness of the men towards the fair sex, and their profound\r\npassion for horses.\"\r\n\r\nOfficers of the life and horse guards--\r\n\r\n\"Cupid seems to have chosen them--they are possessed of such ideal\r\nbeauty.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish taverns--\r\n\r\n     \"The Englishman likes to be alone, even at the tavern. He\r\n     fastens himself up in a box, where none can see him. There\r\n     he drinks with taciturn phlegm. He takes tea, boiling grog,\r\n     porter of the color of ink, and beer not less black. He is\r\n     very fond of brandy, and drinks large glasses of it at a\r\n     draught. He does not go to the tavern to amuse himself, but\r\n     because drinking is a grave occupation. The more he swallows\r\n     the calmer he is. One can however scarcely decide if his\r\n     obstinate moroseness be a precaution against drunkenness, or\r\n     the effect of spirituous liquors taken in excess. At some of\r\n     the taverns are three gentlemen, dressed in black, with\r\n     white cravats, who sing after one of them has struck the\r\n     table with a little hammer; they are as serious as\r\n     Protestant ministers or money-changers.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish food--\r\n\r\n     \"Thick stupefying beer, meat almost raw and horribly spiced;\r\n     strong libations of port wine, followed by\r\n     plum-pudding--such is the meat of these islanders.\"\r\n\r\nHow the English eat--\r\n\r\n     \"They eat at every hour, every where, and incessantly. The\r\n     iron constitution of their complaisant stomachs enables them\r\n     to feed in a manner which would satisfy wolves and lions.\r\n     The delicate repast of a fair and sentimental young lady\r\n     would be too much for a couple of Parisian street porters.\"\r\n\r\nStables and museums--\r\n\r\n     \"Stables are clean and brilliant as museums ought to be; and\r\n     the museums are as filthy as stables in Provence.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen's stables--\r\n\r\n     \"They form a college of horses, with pedantic grooms for\r\n     professors, and a harness room for a library:\"\r\n\r\nEnglish omnibuses--\r\n\r\n     \"The omnibuses of London are worn out, ill built, and\r\n     remarkably dirty. Even in wet weather nobody is ever allowed\r\n     to enter the interior so long as any places are vacant\r\n     outside.

The city is too large; a man is lost\r\n     in it; you elbow thousands of people without the hope of\r\n     meeting any one you know. Even if you have a large fortune\r\n     you would be ignored. Originality is there without effect;\r\n     vanity without an object; and the desire of shining is\r\n     chimerical. Intelligence has therefore only one opening,\r\n     politics; pride only one object, the national sentiment; but\r\n     as the people must feel enthusiasm for something, they adore\r\n     horses; and as they must admire somebody, they burn incense\r\n     under Lord Wellington's nose.\"\r\n\r\nAfter midnight--\r\n\r\n     \"At midnight the English leave the taverns, the public\r\n     gardens, the theatres, and the open air balls, and fill up\r\n     the supper saloons (not very reputable places), and the\r\n     oyster rooms, where they eat till morning. After sunrise,\r\n     the policemen are occupied in picking up in the gutters\r\n     drunkards of both sexes, and all conditions.\"\r\n\r\nLondon rain--\r\n\r\n     \"It is tallow melted in water, and perfectly black.\"\r\n\r\nA bad quarter--\r\n\r\n     \"Between Cornhill Street and Thames Street, there lives what\r\n     is called the populace of London; there pauperism is\r\n     frightful.

When the doors are\r\n     open, blows with the fist and the elbow are given without\r\n     regard to age or sex. It is the peculiar fashion of entering\r\n     which the natives have. If a Frenchman be recognized the\r\n     people cry _French dog_. In the pit, the man behind you will\r\n     place his foot on your shoulder. The ladies are plunged up\r\n     to the neck in boxes. In the theatre there is an echo, which\r\n     produces an abominable effect; but such is the vile musical\r\n     taste of the English that they have never found it out.

The lords, when assembled, are generally placed\r\n     on their backs, or rather lean on the back of the neck, and\r\n     keep their legs above their heads. The Queen's throne, like\r\n     constitutional royalty, is a gilded cage.\"\r\n\r\nThe new Houses of Parliament--\r\n\r\n     \"They are an immense architectural plaything, and the\r\n     English only admire them because they cost a vast sum.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish love of titles--\r\n\r\n     \"One of my friends gave me a letter of introduction to Sir\r\n     William P----, _Esquire_. I left the letter with my card at\r\n     the Reform Club, Pall Mall. Two hours after Sir William came\r\n     to my residence; but as I was not at home he wrote a line,\r\n     and addressed it to me with the flattering designation of\r\n     _Esquire_. England is the country of legal equality; but\r\n     this sort of equilibrium does not extend to social usages;\r\n     and although our _penchant_ for distinctions seems puerile\r\n     to the English, it would be easy to prove that they are not\r\n     exempt from it. They have not, as we have, the love of\r\n     uniforms, laced coats, epaulettes, or decorations; their\r\n     button-holes often carry a flower, but never a rosette or\r\n     knot of ribbon. But every body pretends to the title of\r\n     _Sir_, which was formerly reserved exclusively to members of\r\n     the House of Commons, to Baronets, and to some public\r\n     functionaries. As, however, the title _Sir_ has become too\r\n     vulgar, every body calls himself _Esquire_ to distinguish\r\n     himself from his neighbor. This remark, nevertheless, does\r\n     not concern my friend Sir William, for he is really an\r\n     Esquire.\"\r\n\r\nEnglish soldiers--\r\n\r\n     \"The noise which announces their approach is very singular.\r\n     Picture to yourself the monotonous music of a bear's dance,\r\n     executed by twenty fifers, whilst a man beats a big drum.\r\n     The coats of the infantry are too short, and are surmounted\r\n     with large white epaulettes. The men sway their bodies about\r\n     to the beating of the drum, and carry their heads so stiffly\r\n     that they appear to be balancing spoons on their noses.

The proof that there exists only one character\r\n     amongst them, and that they have only one way of living, is,\r\n     that it is impossible, on seeing them, to divine their\r\n     profession. A lord, a minister, a domestic, a street singer,\r\n     a merchant, an admiral, a soldier, a general, an artist, a\r\n     judge, a prize-fighter, and a clergyman, have all the same\r\n     appearance, the same language, the same costume, and the\r\n     same bearing. Each one has the air of an Englishman, and\r\n     nothing more. They live in the same way, work at the same\r\n     hours, eat at the same time, and of the same sort of food,\r\n     and are all sequestrated when away from home from the\r\n     society of women.\"\r\n\r\nThe French at London--\r\n\r\n     \"At London the French labor under two subjects of anxiety,\r\n     caused by their national prejudices. Accustomed to consider\r\n     themselves as the first people in the world, to dazzle some,\r\n     to despise others, and to display every where the confident\r\n     pride of their supremacy, they, on treading the British\r\n     soil, experience the impression of a greatness not borrowed\r\n     from them; they are astonished at finding a people as\r\n     remarkable as ours, as original as we are, and carrying to a\r\n     still prouder degree the sentiment of their pre-eminence.\r\n     Then our countrymen become disquieted; the intolerance of\r\n     their national faith becomes mitigated; they are ill at\r\n     ease, and for the first time in their lives feel constraint.\r\n     Ceasing to believe themselves amongst slaves as in Italy,\r\n     amongst vassals as in Belgium, or amongst innkeepers as in\r\n     Switzerland or Germany, they endeavor to resemble sovereigns\r\n     visiting other sovereigns, and by forced politeness render\r\n     them involuntary homage.\"\r\n\r\nFeeling of the English toward the French--\r\n\r\n     \"They honor us with a marked attention, though they are\r\n     indifferent to the rest of mankind. Our opinions respecting\r\n     them cause them anxiety. They either admire us\r\n     enthusiastically, or disparage us bitterly; but, in reality,\r\n     they are obsequious and servile toward us!\"\r\n\r\nAfter a good deal of the numerous statues to Wellington, this at\r\nEnglish admiration of Waterloo--\r\n\r\n     \"The trumpet of Waterloo which has been sounded in London\r\n     every where incessantly, and in every tone, during\r\n     thirty-five years, diminishes the grandeur of the English\r\n     nation. This intoxication seems that of a people who, never\r\n     having won more than one battle, and despairing to conquer a\r\n     second time, cannot recover from their surprise, nor bear in\r\n     patience an unhoped-for glory.\"\r\n\r\nHow the English judge Napoleon--\r\n\r\n     \"Public opinion has avenged the prisoner of St Helena; but\r\n     does it follow that in 1815 the English protested with\r\n     sufficient energy against his imprisonment! No. Englishmen\r\n     are naturally indifferent and indulgent as regards their\r\n     foreign neighbors, so long as patriotism or private interest\r\n     is not at stake. Napoleon was the most terrible of their\r\n     enemies; he placed England within ten steps of bankruptcy,\r\n     and seriously menaced national manufactures. Not possessed\r\n     of military instinct, the English do not pretend to\r\n     chivalrous generosity. On the fall of the Empire, caused by\r\n     the implacable perseverance of coalitions, the nation\r\n     remembered that the Hundred Days cost its government a\r\n     million an hour, and so long as the deficit was not made up,\r\n     their resentment underwent no diminution. But now if you\r\n     celebrate his glory before them, they will not display\r\n     hostility. You must not, however, touch the till of this\r\n     tribe of tradesmen, or they will be your bitter enemies. And\r\n     the proof that they are nothing but shopkeepers is that\r\n     their first functionary sits in a gilded arm chair on a\r\n     wool-sack.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEAUTIFUL STREAMLET AND THE UTILITARIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlphonse Karr's new book, _Travels in my Garden_, is full of social\r\nheresies, but quite as full of wit. We find in _Fraser's Magazine_ for\r\nMay translations of some admirable passages, with specimens of his\r\npeculiar speculation. Karr is an ardent lover of Nature; he takes note\r\nof all her caprices, and respects them,--remarks under what shade the\r\nviolet loves to dwell, and tells us how certain plants--the volubulis,\r\nthe scarlet-runner, and the Westeria, for instance--invariably twine\r\ntheir spiral tendrils from left to right, whereas hops and\r\nhoneysuckles as infallibly twist theirs from right to left. He knows\r\nwhich are the plants that fold, when evening comes, their leaves in\r\ntwo, lengthwise,--which are those that close them up like fans, and\r\nwhich are the careless ones that crumple them up irregularly with\r\nhappy impunity, for the next morning's sun smooths them all alike. He\r\nloves Nature in all her details, but with disinterested love, and has\r\nno idea of making her subservient to his pride, or selfishly\r\nmonopolizing her; he has evidently no wish to wall in woods and\r\nmeadows, and call them a park, or to dam up sparkling, bubbling,\r\ndancing streams, and turn them into cold, spiritless, aristocratic\r\nsheets of water. Indeed, in one of the first chapters of the book,\r\nthere is a fanciful bit of sentiment about a happy little stream that\r\nfalls into the hands of a pitiless utilitarian, which we are tempted\r\nto quote:--\r\n\r\n     \"That stream which runs through my garden gushes from the\r\n     side of a furze-covered hill; for a long time it was a happy\r\n     little stream; it traversed meadows where all sorts of\r\n     lovely wild flowers bathed and mirrored themselves in its\r\n     waters, then it entered my garden, and there I was ready to\r\n     receive it; I had prepared green tanks for it; on its edge\r\n     and in its very bed I had planted those flowers which all\r\n     over the world love to bloom on the banks and in the bosom\r\n     of pure streams; it flowed through my garden, murmuring its\r\n     plaintive song; then, fragrant with my flowers, it left the\r\n     garden, crossed another meadow, and flung itself into the\r\n     sea, over the precipitous sides of the cliff, which it\r\n     covered with foam.\r\n\r\n     \"It was a happy stream; it had literally nothing to do\r\n     beyond what I have said,--to flow, to bubble, to look\r\n     limpid, to murmur, amidst flowers and sweet perfumes. It led\r\n     the life I have chosen, and that I continue to lead, when\r\n     people let me alone, and when knaves and fools and wicked\r\n     men do not force me--who am at once the most pacific and the\r\n     most battling man on earth--to return to the fight. But\r\n     heaven and earth are jealous of the happiness of gentle\r\n     indolence.\r\n\r\n     \"One day my brother Eugene, and Savage, the clever engineer,\r\n     were talking together on the banks of the stream, and to a\r\n     certain degree abusing it.\r\n\r\n     \"'There,' said my brother, 'is a fine good-for-nothing\r\n     stream for you, forsooth, winding and dawdling about,\r\n     dancing in the sunshine, and revelling in the grass instead\r\n     of working and paying for the place it takes up, as an\r\n     honest stream should. Could it not be made to grind coffee\r\n     or pepper?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Or tools?' added Savage.\r\n\r\n     \"'Or to saw boards?' said my brother.\r\n\r\n     \"I trembled for the stream, and broke off the conversation,\r\n     complaining loudly that its detractors (its would-be\r\n     tyrants) were treading down my forget-me-nots. Alas! it was\r\n     but against them alone I could protect it. Before long there\r\n     came into our neighborhood a man whom I noticed more than\r\n     once hanging about the spot where the stream empties itself\r\n     into the sea. The fellow I plainly saw was neither seeking\r\n     for rhymes, nor indulging in dreams and memories upon its\r\n     banks,--he was not lulling thought to rest with the gentle\r\n     murmur of its waters. 'My good friend,' he was saying to the\r\n     stream, 'there you are, idling and meandering about, singing\r\n     to your heart's content, while I am working and wearing\r\n     myself out. I don't see why you should not help me a bit;\r\n     you know nothing of the work to be done, but I'll soon show\r\n     you. You'll soon know how to set about it. You must find it\r\n     dull to stay in this way, doing nothing,--it would be a\r\n     change for you to make files or grind knives.' Very soon\r\n     wheels of all kinds were brought to the poor stream. From\r\n     that day forward it has worked and turned a great wheel,\r\n     which turns a little wheel, which turns a grindstone; it\r\n     still sings, but no longer the same gently-monotonous song\r\n     in its peaceful melancholy. Its song is loud and angry\r\n     now,--it leaps and froths and works now,--it grinds knives!\r\n     It still crosses the meadow, and my garden, and the next\r\n     meadow; but there, the man is on the watch for it, to make\r\n     it work. I have done the only thing I could do for it. I\r\n     have dug a new bed for it in my garden, so that it may idle\r\n     longer there, and leave me a little later; but for all that,\r\n     it must go at last and grind knives. Poor stream! thou didst\r\n     not sufficiently conceal thy happiness in obscurity,--thou\r\n     hast murmured too audibly thy gentle music.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR EMERSON TENNANT ON AMERICAN MISSIONS IN CEYLON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most respectable persons employed in the English colonial\r\nservice, is Sir EMERSON TENNANT, LL. D., K. C. B. &c., who was for\r\nmany years connected with the administration in Ceylon, and is now, we\r\nbelieve, Governor of St. Helena. He has recently published a volume\r\nentitled _Christianity in Ceylon_, in which there are some passages of\r\nespecial interest to American readers, displaying in a favorable\r\nlight, the services rendered to civilization by the missionaries of\r\nthis country. These parts of his work have attracted much\r\nconsideration. The _Dublin University Magazine_ remarks:\r\n\r\n\"We describe the American Mission, which acts under the direction of\r\none of the oldest and most remarkable of the existing associations for\r\nthe dissemination of Christianity, \"The American Board of\r\nCommissioners for Foreign Missions,\" whose head-quarters are at\r\nBoston, in Massachusetts. The first settlers in Massachusetts, like\r\nthose of New England generally, were missionary colonists. Their\r\ncharter, given by Charles I., states that one of the objects of the\r\nking and of the planters was the conversion of the natives to the true\r\nfaith; and the seal of the company thus incorporated bore the device\r\nof a North American Indian, with the motto \"_Come over and help us_.\"\r\nIt may be interesting to add, that the \"pilgrim fathers\" of the New\r\nEngland States were, indirectly, the cause of the Protestant missions\r\nof the Dutch. They were, as our author states, 'the first pioneers of\r\nthe Protestant world, and the first heralds of the Reformed religion\r\nto the heathen of foreign lands. Their mission is more ancient than\r\nthe Propaganda of Rome, and it preceded by nearly a century any other\r\nmissionary association in Europe. It was encouraged by Cromwell, and\r\nincorporated by Charles II.; and Cotton Mather records that it was the\r\nexample of the New England fathers, and their success amongst the\r\nIndians, that first aroused the energy of the Dutch for the conversion\r\nof the natives of Ceylon.'\r\n\r\n\"We cannot doubt that amongst the main causes of the prosperity of\r\nNorth America are, the permanence of religious feeling, and the\r\nblessing attendant on the fact, that the missionary spirit has never\r\nperished. The labors of this great people on their own vast continent\r\nhave been conducted with the greatest judgment, and marked by a\r\nsuccess which encouraged their extension in other lands. In the year\r\n1812, they turned their attention to the East, and, under an act of\r\nincorporation from the state of Massachusetts, commenced their\r\nmissionary efforts in the Old World. Their first missionaries to India\r\nappeared there in 1812, but were ordered by the Governor-General to\r\nleave Calcutta by the same vessel in which they had arrived. One of\r\nthem landing in Ceylon, on his voyage home, was so struck with the\r\nopenings which it presented for missionary enterprise, and so much\r\nencouraged by the Governor, Sir Robert Brownrigg, to engage in it,\r\nthat, on his representations, the American Board, in 1816, sent out\r\nthree clergymen and their wives, who fixed their residence at Jaffina,\r\nwhich has been ever since the scene of their remarkable labors. These\r\nwere reinforced in 1829, and for many years their establishment has\r\nconsisted of from seven to eleven ordained ministers, with a\r\nphysician, conductors of the press, and other lay assistants; these\r\nare selected from Congregationalists and Presbyterians. It is\r\ngratifying to be enabled to add, that a most cordial good-will and\r\ndesire to co-operate has from the beginning prevailed between them and\r\nthe other Protestant missionaries in their neighborhood. For thirty\r\nyears they have assembled periodically in a \"missionary union,\" to\r\ndecide on measures and compare results. \"With all of them education\r\nis,\" as our author says, \"a diurnal occupation; whilst in their purely\r\nclerical capacity they have felt the necessity of proceeding with more\r\ncautious circumspection, improving rather than creating opportunities,\r\nrelying less upon formal preaching than on familiar discourses, and\r\ntrusting more to the intimate exhortation of a few than to the effect\r\nof popular addresses to indiscriminate assemblies.'\r\n\r\n     \"'The first embryo instruction is communicated by them in\r\n     free village schools, scattered everywhere throughout the\r\n     district, in which the children of the Tamils are taught in\r\n     their own tongue the simplest elements of knowledge, and the\r\n     earliest processes of education--to read from translations\r\n     of the Christian Scriptures, and to write their own\r\n     language, first by tracing the letters on the sand, and\r\n     eventually by inscribing them with an iron style upon the\r\n     prepared leaves of the _Palmyra palm_. It will afford an\r\n     idea of the extent and perseverance with which education has\r\n     been pursued in these primitive institutions, that, in the\r\n     free schools of the Americans alone, 4,000 pupils, of whom\r\n     one-fourth are females, are daily receiving instruction, and\r\n     upwards of 90,000 children have been taught in them since\r\n     their commencement, a proportion equal to one-half the\r\n     present population of the peninsula.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It was soon seen that, in addition to these primary schools, the\r\nestablishment of boarding schools was extremely desirable, for the\r\npurpose of separating the pupils from the influence of idolatry. The\r\nattempt was made, but proved to be attended with difficulties which\r\nwould have appeared to many insurmountable. In the first place, the\r\nnatives were suspicious, not conceiving that strangers could undertake\r\nsuch toil, trouble, and expense, without an interested object. The\r\nmore positive difficulty was connected with caste, with the reluctance\r\nof parents to permit their children to associate with those of a lower\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n     \"'This the missionaries overcame, not so much by inveighing\r\n     against the absurdity of such distinctions as by practically\r\n     ignoring them, except wherever expediency or necessity\r\n     required their recognition. In all other cases where the\r\n     customs and prejudices of the Tamils were harmless in\r\n     themselves, or productive of no inconvenience to others,\r\n     they were in no way contravened or prohibited; but as\r\n     intelligence increased, and the minds of the pupils became\r\n     expanded, the most distinctive and objectionable of them\r\n     were voluntarily and almost imperceptibly abandoned.\r\n\r\n     \"'When the boarders were first admitted to one of the\r\n     American schools at Batticotta, a cook-house was obliged to\r\n     be erected for them on the adjoining premises of a heathen,\r\n     as they would not eat under the roof of a Christian; but\r\n     after a twelvemonth's perseverance, the inconvenience\r\n     overcame the objection, and they removed to the refectory of\r\n     the institution. But here a fresh difficulty was to be\r\n     encountered; some of the high caste youths made an objection\r\n     to use the same wells which had been common to the whole\r\n     establishment; and it was agreed to meet their wishes by\r\n     permitting them to clear out one in particular, to be\r\n     reserved exclusively for themselves. They worked incessantly\r\n     for a day, but finding it hopeless to draw it perfectly dry,\r\n     they resolved to accommodate the difficulty, on the\r\n     principle, that having drawn off as much water as the well\r\n     contained when they began, the remainder must be\r\n     sufficiently pure for all ordinary uses.'\"\r\n\r\n\"In addition to these primary and boarding-schools, the American\r\nMission, in 1830, established schools for teaching English, and for\r\nelementary instruction of a more advanced description. These were all\r\nunder a discipline avowedly Christian, yet the missionaries found that\r\nthey were able not only to enforce the fee demanded, but to maintain\r\ntheir regulations without loss of numbers.\r\n\r\n     \"'And it is a fact,' says Sir Emerson Tennent, 'suggestive\r\n     of curious speculation as to the genius and character of\r\n     this anomalous people, that in a heathen school recently\r\n     established by Brahmans in the vicinity of Jaffna, the\r\n     Hindoo Community actually compelled those who conducted it\r\n     to introduce the reading of the Bible as an indispensable\r\n     portion of the ordinary course of instruction.'\"\r\n\r\n\"This does not seem so strange to us. The shrewd Tamils, as we collect\r\nfrom other observations in the work before us, perceived how the\r\nBible-reading children had improved in demeanor, conduct, and success\r\nin life. For these same reasons, and possibly in some cases from a\r\ndeeper feeling never yet avowed, the Roman Catholic peasantry of\r\nIreland, before the introduction of the National System of Education,\r\nand previously to, and, in many cases, long after, the expressed\r\nhostility of their priesthood, anxiously sent their children to the\r\nschools of the Kildare-place and the Hibernian Bible Societies.\r\n\r\n\"The other missionaries, we need hardly say, were as active as the\r\nAmericans. After some years of further experience, they all felt the\r\nnecessity of founding educational institutions of a still more\r\nadvanced description for the instruction of the natives in their own\r\nlanguage. It became plain to them that, from physical as well as moral\r\ncauses, the conversion of the natives could be only hoped for through\r\nthe medium of their well-taught and well-trained countrymen. The\r\nniceties of the language and their modes of thought presented\r\ndifficulties of a most serious character to others; the very terms of\r\nthe ordinary address of a missionary suggested ideas altogether\r\ndifferent from what he intended. Thus, when GOD is spoken of, they\r\nprobably understand one of their own deities who yields to every vile\r\nindulgence; by SIN, they mean ceremonial defilement, or evil committed\r\nin a former birth, for which they are not accountable; _hell_ with\r\nthem is only a place of temporary punishment; and _heaven_ nothing\r\nmore than absorption, or the loss of individuality. Under these\r\nimpressions each of the missionary bodies at Jaffna formed for\r\nthemselves a collegiate institution, in which the best scholars from\r\ntheir other schools were admitted to a still more advanced course, and\r\ntaught the sciences of Europe. That of the Church Missionary Society\r\nof England was established at Nellore, but subsequently removed to\r\nChundically; the Wesleyans commenced theirs in the great square of\r\nJaffna; and that of the Americans was founded at Batticotta, in the\r\nmidst of a cultivated country, within sight of the sea, and at a very\r\nfew miles distant from the fort.\"\r\n\r\n     \"'It was opened in 1823, with about fifty students chosen\r\n     from the most successful pupils of all the schools in the\r\n     province; and the course of education is so comprehensive as\r\n     to extend over a period of eight years of study. With a\r\n     special regard to the future usefulness of its alumni in the\r\n     conflict with the errors of the Brahmanical system, the\r\n     curriculum embraces all the ordinary branches of historical\r\n     and classical learning, and all the higher departments of\r\n     mathematical and physical science, combined with the most\r\n     intricate familiarization with the great principles and\r\n     evidences of the Christian religion.\r\n\r\n     \"'The number which the building can accommodate is limited,\r\n     for the present, to one hundred, who reside within its\r\n     walls, and take their food in one common hall, sitting to\r\n     eat after the custom of the natives. For some years the\r\n     students were boarded and clothed at the expense of the\r\n     mission; but such is now the eagerness for instruction that\r\n     there are a multitude of competitors for every casual\r\n     vacancy; and the cost of their maintenance during the whole\r\n     period of pupilage is willingly paid in advance, in order to\r\n     secure the privilege of admission.\r\n\r\n     \"'Nearly six hundred students have been under instruction\r\n     from time to time since the commencement of the American\r\n     Seminary at Batticotta, and of these upwards of four hundred\r\n     have completed the established course of education. More\r\n     than one-half have made an open profession of Christianity,\r\n     and all have been familiarized with its doctrines, and more\r\n     or less imbued with its spirit. The majority are now filling\r\n     situations of credit and responsibility throughout the\r\n     various districts of Ceylon; numbers are employed under the\r\n     missionaries themselves, as teachers and catechists, and as\r\n     preachers and superintendents of schools; many have\r\n     migrated, in similar capacities, to be attached to Christian\r\n     missions on the continent of India; others have lent their\r\n     assistance to the missions of the Wesleyans and the Church\r\n     of England in Ceylon; and amongst those who have attached\r\n     themselves to secular occupations, I can bear testimony to\r\n     the abilities, the qualifications, and integrity, of the\r\n     many students of Jaffna, who have accepted employment in\r\n     various offices under the Government of the colony.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Another of the instruments of conversion adopted by these\r\nindefatigable men is _the press_. They were long obliged to have their\r\ntracts written out on _olahs_, or strips of the Palmyra leaf, which,\r\nwhen the missionary took for distribution, were strung round the neck\r\nof his horse. The printing establishment of the American Mission has\r\nfor many years given constant employment to upwards of eighty Tamil\r\nworkmen. Their publications are either religious or educational; and\r\none of their ulterior objects is to supersede the degraded legends\r\nstill in circulation. The natives of Ceylon, like most other Asiatics,\r\nhave a strong repugnance to reading. This, however, has been to some\r\nextent already overcome, both on the continent of India and in Ceylon,\r\nas is evident from the facts of the establishment of native presses in\r\nHindostan, and of the success of a missionary newspaper in Ceylon for\r\nthe last seven years, which has now more than seven hundred\r\nsubscribers, of whom five-sixths are Tamils. The Church Missionary\r\nSociety have also a press amongst the Tamils; the Wesleyans\r\nestablished theirs in the Singhalese districts, and the Baptists have\r\none at work in Kandy. One of the greatest, among the many triumphs of\r\nthe missionaries in Ceylon, has been in the education of girls. The\r\nposition of woman in that island, as in most parts of the East, was\r\none of inferiority and toil. She was not permitted to sit at table\r\nwith the males, or even to eat in the presence of her husband. Her\r\neducation was so wholly neglected that, amongst the Tamils, no woman\r\nknew her alphabet, except such as rather gave the accomplishment a bad\r\nname--the dancing girls and prostitutes attached to the temples, who\r\nlearned to read and write that they might copy songs and the legends\r\nof their gods. It was, however, plain that no extensive good would be\r\neffected without the education of women. The male converts could not\r\nget suitable wives, and the children would be in the hands of\r\nidolaters. In addition to their natural influence in a family, the\r\nwomen of the Tamils, where this new attempt in education was first\r\nmade, had rights of property, which, notwithstanding the inferiority\r\nof their social position, gave them peculiar influence.\r\n\r\n     \"'It is, we are told, a paramount object of ambition with\r\n     Tamil parents to secure an eligible alliance for their\r\n     daughters by the assignment of extravagant marriage\r\n     portions. These consist either of land, or of money secured\r\n     upon land; and as the law of Ceylon recognizes the absolute\r\n     control of the lady over the property thus conveyed to her\r\n     sole and separate use, the prevalence of the practice has,\r\n     by degrees, thrown an extraordinary extent of the landed\r\n     property of the country into the hands of the females, and\r\n     invested them with a corresponding proportion of authority\r\n     in its management.'\"\r\n\r\nImpressed with the urgency of the object, the missionaries attempted\r\nthe establishment of female schools, and especially of boarding\r\nschools, where Hindoo girls might be trained, and separated from evil\r\ninfluences until they could be settled with the approbation of the\r\nguardians. They had at first great difficulty in getting pupils, and\r\nonly enticed them by presents of dress, or some such cogent bribe, or\r\nby engagements to give fortunes of five or six pounds to all who\r\nremained in their institutions until suitably married. Even with these\r\nallurements their early efforts promised no success. Parents were\r\ninveighed against for allowing their daughters to be instructed, and\r\nso strong was native prejudice that the children, when learning to\r\nread, blushed with shame. These and other obstacles have been\r\nsurmounted, and, as the following extract shows, the missionaries have\r\nno longer to allure, but must select their scholars. The Americans\r\nmade the first experiment at Oodooville, a few miles distant from the\r\nfort of Jaffna:--\r\n\r\n     \"'The hamlet of Oodooville is in the centre of a tract of\r\n     very rich land, and the buildings occupied by the Americans\r\n     were originally erected by the Portuguese for a Roman\r\n     Catholic church, and the residence of a friar of the order\r\n     of St. Francis. It is a beautiful spot, embowered in trees,\r\n     and all its grounds and gardens are kept in becoming order,\r\n     with the nicest care and attention.\r\n\r\n     \"'The institution opened in 1824, with about thirty pupils,\r\n     between the ages of five and eleven; and this, after eight\r\n     years of previous exertion and entreaty, was the utmost\r\n     number of female scholars who could be prevailed on to\r\n     attend from the whole extent of the province. This\r\n     difficulty has been long since overcome. Instead of\r\n     solicitations and promises, to allure scholars, the\r\n     missionaries have long since been obliged to limit their\r\n     admissions to one hundred, the utmost that their buildings\r\n     can accommodate; and now, so eager are the natives to secure\r\n     education for their daughters, that a short time before my\r\n     visit, on the occasion of filling up some vacancies, upwards\r\n     of sixty candidates were in anxious attendance, of whom only\r\n     seventeen could be selected, there being room for no more.\r\n     The earliest inmates of the institution were of low castes\r\n     and poor; whereas the pupils and candidates now are, many of\r\n     them, of most respectable families, and the daughters of\r\n     persons of property and influence in the district.\r\n\r\n     \"'The course of instruction is in all particulars adapted to\r\n     suit the social circumstances of the community; along with a\r\n     thorough knowledge of the Scriptures and the principles of\r\n     the Christian religion, it embraces all the ordinary\r\n     branches of female education, which are communicated both in\r\n     Tamil and in English; and combined with this intellectual\r\n     culture, the girls are carefully trained, conformably to the\r\n     usages of their country, in all the discipline and\r\n     acquirements essential to economy and domestic enjoyments at\r\n     home. Of two hundred and fifty females who have been thus\r\n     brought up at Oodooville, more than half have been since\r\n     married to Christians, and are now communicating to their\r\n     children the same training and advantages of which they have\r\n     so strongly felt the benefit themselves.'\"\r\n\r\n\"The consequence of these proceedings is, that the number of\r\nhouseholds is fast increasing, where the mother, trained in the habits\r\nof civilized life, and instructed in the principles of Christianity,\r\nis anxious to give to her children the like advantages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PAPER OF ... TOBACCO.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find a lively passage on tobacco in the pleasant new book by\r\nAlphonse Karr. It must be borne in mind that, in France, tobacco is a\r\nmonopoly--and a very productive one--in the hands of government:--\r\n\r\n     \"There is a family of poisonous plants, amongst which we may\r\n     notice the henbane, the datura stramonium, and the tobacco\r\n     plant. The tobacco plant is perhaps a little less poisonous\r\n     than the datura, but it is more so than the henbane, which\r\n     is a violent poison. Here is a tobacco plant--as fine a\r\n     plant as you can wish to see. It grows to the height of six\r\n     feet; and from the centre of a tuft of leaves, of a\r\n     beautiful green, shoot out elegant and graceful clusters of\r\n     pink flowers.\r\n\r\n     \"For a long while the tobacco plant grew unknown and\r\n     solitary in the wilds of America. The savage to whom we had\r\n     given brandy gave us in exchange tobacco, with the smoke of\r\n     which they used to intoxicate themselves on grand occasions.\r\n     The intercourse between the two worlds began by this amiable\r\n     interchange of poisons.\r\n\r\n     \"Those who first thought of putting tobacco dust up their\r\n     noses were first laughed at, and then persecuted more or\r\n     less. James I., of England, wrote against snuff-takers a\r\n     book entitled _Misocapnos_. Some years later, Pope Urban\r\n     VIII. excommunicated all persons who took snuff in churches.\r\n     The Empress Elizabeth thought it necessary to add something\r\n     to the penalty of excommunication pronounced against those\r\n     who used the black dust during divine service, and\r\n     authorised the beadles to confiscate the snuff-boxes to\r\n     their own use. Amurath IV. forbade the use of snuff under\r\n     pain of having the nose cut of.\r\n\r\n     \"No useful plant could have withstood such attacks. If\r\n     before this invention a man had been found to say, Let us\r\n     seek the means of filling the coffers of the state by a\r\n     voluntary tax; let us set about selling something which\r\n     every body will like to do without. In America there is a\r\n     plant essentially poisonous; if from its leaves you extract\r\n     an empyreumatic oil, a single drop of it will cause an\r\n     animal to die in horrible convulsions. Suppose we offer this\r\n     plant for sale chopped up or reduced to a powder. We will\r\n     sell it very dear, and tell people to stuff the powder up\r\n     their noses.\r\n\r\n     \"'That is to say, I suppose, you will force them to do so by\r\n     law?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Not a bit of it. I spoke of a voluntary tax. As to the\r\n     portion we chop up, we will tell them to inhale it, and\r\n     swallow a little of the smoke from it besides.'\r\n\r\n     \"'But it will kill them.'\r\n\r\n     \"'No; they will become rather pale, perhaps feel giddy, spit\r\n     blood, and suffer from colics, or have pains in the\r\n     chest--that's all. Besides, you know, although it has been\r\n     often said that habit is second nature, people are not yet\r\n     aware how completely man resembles the knife, of which the\r\n     blade first and then the handle had been changed two or\r\n     three times. In man there is no nature left--nothing but\r\n     habit remains. People will become like Mithridates, who had\r\n     learnt to live on poisons.\r\n\r\n     \"'The first time that a man will smoke he will feel\r\n     sickness, nausea, giddiness, and colics; but that will go\r\n     off by degrees, and in time he will get so accustomed to it,\r\n     that he will only feel such symptoms now and then--when he\r\n     smokes tobacco that is bad, or too strong--or when he is not\r\n     well, and in five or six other cases. Those who take it in\r\n     powder will sneeze, have a disagreeable smell, lose the\r\n     sense of smelling, and establish in their nose a sort of\r\n     perpetual blister.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Then, I suppose it smells very nice.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Quite the reverse. It has a very unpleasant smell; but, as\r\n     I said, we'll sell it very dear, and reserve to ourselves\r\n     the monopoly of it.'\r\n\r\n     \"'My good friend,' one would have said to any one absurd\r\n     enough to hold a similar language, 'nobody will envy you the\r\n     privilege of selling a weed that no one will care to buy.\r\n     You might as well open a shop and write on it: Kicks sold\r\n     here; or, Such-a-one sells blows, wholesale and retail. You\r\n     will find as many customers as for your poisonous weed.'\r\n\r\n     \"Well! who would have believed that the first speaker was\r\n     right, and that the tobacco speculation would answer\r\n     perfectly! The kings of France have written no satires\r\n     against snuff, have had no noses cut off, no snuff-boxes\r\n     confiscated. Far from it. They have sold tobacco, laid an\r\n     impost on noses, and given snuff-boxes to poets with their\r\n     portraits on the lid, and diamonds all round. This little\r\n     trade has brought them in I don't know how many millions a\r\n     year. The potato was far more difficult to popularize, and\r\n     has still some adversaries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD JEFFREY AND JOANNA BAILLIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoanna Baillie's first volume of poems was severely criticised in the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_ by Jeffrey. In an article upon the deceased poetess\r\nin _Chambers's Journal_, we have an account of her subsequent\r\nrelations with the reviewer. She visited Edinburgh in 1808.\r\n\r\n     \"As she did not refuse to go into company, she could not be\r\n     long in that city without encountering Francis Jeffrey, the\r\n     foremost man in the bright train of _beaux-esprits_ which\r\n     then adorned the society of the Scottish capital. He would\r\n     gladly have been presented to her; and if she had permitted\r\n     it, there is little doubt that in the eloquent flow of his\r\n     delightful and genial conversation, enough of the admiration\r\n     he really felt for her poetry must have been expressed, to\r\n     have softened her into listening at least with patience to\r\n     his suggestions for her improvement. But in vain did the\r\n     friendly Mrs. Betty Hamilton (authoress of 'The Cottagers of\r\n     Glenburnie') beg for leave to present him to her when they\r\n     met in her hospitable drawing-room; and equally in vain were\r\n     the efforts made by the good-natured Duchess of Gordon to\r\n     bring about an introduction which she knew was desired at\r\n     least by one of the parties. It was civilly but coldly\r\n     declined by the poetess; and though the dignified reason\r\n     assigned was the propriety of leaving the critic more\r\n     entirely at liberty in his future strictures than an\r\n     _acquaintance_ might perhaps feel himself, there seems\r\n     little reason to doubt that soreness and natural resentment\r\n     had something to do with the refusal.\"\r\n\r\n     \"It was in the autumn of 1820 that Miss Baillie paid her\r\n     last visit to Scotland, and passed those delightful days\r\n     with Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford, the second of which is\r\n     so pleasantly given in Mr. Lockhart's life of the bard. Her\r\n     friends again perceived a change in her manners. They had\r\n     become blander, and much more cordial. She had probably been\r\n     now too long admired and reverently looked up to not to\r\n     understand her own position, and the encouragement which,\r\n     essentially unassuming as she was, would be necessary from\r\n     her to reassure the timid and satisfy the proud. She had\r\n     magnanimously forgiven and lived down the unjust severity of\r\n     her Edinburgh critic, and now no longer refused to be made\r\n     personally known to him. He was presented to her by their\r\n     mutual friend, the amiable Dr. Morehead. They had much\r\n     earnest and interesting talk together, and from that hour to\r\n     the end of their lives entertained for each other a mutual\r\n     and cordial esteem. After this, Jeffrey seldom visited\r\n     London without indulging himself in a friendly pilgrimage to\r\n     the shrine of the secluded poetess; and it is pleasing to\r\n     find him writing of her in the following cordial way in\r\n     later years: \"_London_, April 28, 1840.--I forgot to tell\r\n     you that we have been twice out to Hampstead to hunt out\r\n     Joanna Baillie, and found her the other day as fresh,\r\n     natural, and amiable as ever--and as little like a Tragic\r\n     Muse. Since old Mrs. Brougham's death, I do not know so nice\r\n     an old woman.\" And again, in January 7, 1842.--\"We went to\r\n     Hampstead, and paid a very pleasant visit to Joanna Baillie,\r\n     who is marvellous in health and spirits, and youthful\r\n     freshness and simplicity of feeling, and not a bit deaf,\r\n     blind, or torpid.\"\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Authors and Books._\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. TITUS TOBLER, a Swiss savan, has just published a work entitled\r\n_Golgotha, its Churches and Cloisters_, in the course of which he\r\nundertakes the \"Jerusalem question,\" or the discussion of the probable\r\nlocalities of the Scripture narrative of the crucifixion. Among the\r\nable German accounts of this treatise, which cannot fail to arrest the\r\nattention of the sacred student, we find the following notice of\r\nProfessor Robinson, the first profound and adequate contemporary\r\nauthority upon the subject: \"Until the American Robinson, all the\r\nearly comparisons and criticisms upon the holy sepulchre were based\r\nmuch more upon instinct and furious sectarianism, than upon a generous\r\nlove of truth and a genuine insight into the matter. Only with\r\nwearisome effort, and not without the consent of the whole Church\r\npower, was Robinson's mighty grasp upon pious tradition repelled. In\r\nthe main question the learned Yankee was not altogether wrong. But he\r\nis too rash in battle, too impatient, too reckless, too ambitious, and\r\nhis armor was evidently not proof in all parts. Even the knowledge of\r\nthe Semitic orient, of its antiquities and customs, seems, if we may\r\nsay so without offence to transatlantic vanity, a little threadbare.\r\nBut the Robinsonian breach in the wall was not to be entirely\r\nplastered up and its traces concealed. This American has first\r\nrecognized the right way of breaking into the citadel of tradition;\r\nothers, with more or less skill, have followed his track and widened\r\nthe breach. But it was reserved for the inflexible ability of Dr.\r\nTobler to dig up the very foundations, although he is no centaur, no\r\ngiant, and in the pride of strength, does not scorn a childlike\r\nfaith.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong recent German romances we note second and third editions of\r\nJEREMIAS GOTTHELF'S _Sylvester-Dream_, and the _Peasant's Mirror, or a\r\nLife-History_. The author is not much known beyond Germany, but is\r\nthere recognized as having the greatest certainty and correctness in\r\ndelineation, the most genial principle, and the soundest and freshest\r\nlife of any contemporary writer. The Sylvester-Dream is as vague and\r\nfantastic, and of the same electrical effect, as the similar sparkling\r\nflights of Dickens and Jean Paul. _Uriel the Devil_, a satirical\r\nromance, in eight pictures, bears the name of Kaulbach, but whether\r\nthe author is related to William Kaulbach, the great painter, we have\r\nno means of ascertaining. This, with the _Memorabilia of a German\r\nHouse-Servant_ are spoiled by their imitations of Jean Paul, and the\r\nlatter is somewhat strongly infected with Hoffman's Phantasies. But\r\nthey are both books of more than common talent. Two romances by two\r\nwomen are most curtly and contemptuously noticed, in a style of\r\nuncourteous condemnation hardly to be paralleled in England or\r\nAmerica, in which countries the chivalry of private respect for the\r\nfair sex always ameliorates condemnation of their writings. \"Of these\r\ntwo books there is little else to say than that they are moral and\r\nrespectable, and extremely well written for women. The former author\r\nhas the rare and memorable heroism in a woman to allow her heroine to\r\nreach her thirty-fourth year.\"\r\n\r\nLevin Schuneking formerly Grand-Master at the Court of the Elector of\r\nCologne, has just published _The Peasant Prince_, a romance, called in\r\nGermany his best work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKOHL, the traveller or writer of travels, has just published a book\r\nupon the Rhine, which is not of the usual character of his works, as\r\nthe author perhaps feared too much the criticising contrast of Victor\r\nHugo's _Rhine_, to undertake a detailed and sprightly description of\r\nthe present life and aspect of the country. The new work is, in fact,\r\nan attempt to portray, according to Ritter's principles, a famous\r\nriver region in its geological, historical and statistical relations;\r\nand from this point of view to present it vividly to the mind. The\r\ncontents are simple and succinctly arranged, and the book is a signal\r\nsuccess in the popularization of the results of recent geographical\r\nresearch. It has the same relation to the old river guide books, that\r\nRitter's philosophical geography has to the old geographies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANASTASIUS GRUN, the famous German poet, has just edited the poetical\r\nremains of Nicolaus Lenau, of whom Auerbach wrote a graceful\r\nreminiscence for the German _Museum_, under the title of _Lenau's last\r\nSummer_. The chief poem of the collection is entitled _Don Juan_,\r\nwhich, although not fully finished, the German critics highly extol.\r\nSoon after the death of Lenau, in a madhouse, last year, we gave some\r\naccount of him in the _International_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf Sir CHARLES LYELL'S Second Journey in America, which Mr. E.\r\nDieffenbach has rendered into German, the Germans say that its\r\ngeniality and _gentlemanliness_, its graceful and striking pictures of\r\nthe state of society, politics, and religion, and its popular\r\ntreatment of scientific subjects, make it altogether charming. A\r\nreviewer notes what Lyell says of the universal tendency to read among\r\nthe American laboring classes, and quotes some interesting facts, as\r\nthat one house published eighty thousand copies of Eugene Sue's\r\nWandering Jew, in various forms and at various prices. The same house\r\nhad sold forty thousand copies of Macaulay's History of England, at\r\nthe end of the first three months, at prices varying from fifty cents\r\nto four dollars, while other houses had sold twenty thousand copies,\r\nand this sale of sixty thousand copies while Longman was selling\r\nfifteen thousand at one pound twelve shillings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Countess HAHN-HAHN, who for several years has occupied in German\r\nliterature a position corresponding to that of George Sand in France,\r\nwith whose views of life and society she strongly sympathized, and\r\nwhose \"Faustina\" and other works were republished here, has recently\r\nbecome a Roman Catholic, as our readers will have seen, and has just\r\nwritten the following letter to a Hamburg journal:\r\n\r\n     \"To correct some misapprehension, I feel it to be my duty to\r\n     declare that the new edition of my complete works announced\r\n     by Alexander Duncker in Berlin is no new series, but an\r\n     edition with a new title. A new series of those writings\r\n     will never appear, as I no longer recognize as my own the\r\n     spirit in which they were written.\r\n\r\n                             IDA, COUNTESS HAHN-HAHN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDAVID COPPERFIELD has been translated into German, with the\r\npeculiarities of speech of the different classes of characters\r\nunattempted. Old Pegotty and Ham speak \"pure Castilian.\" It is easy to\r\nsee how the dramatic character of the book is thus lost. Indeed,\r\nDickens is almost the only very famous English author who is not much\r\ntranslated. The Battle of Life, one of the least valuable and\r\ncharacteristic of his works, is well known upon the Continent, because\r\nit was so easy to translate. But what can a descendant of Dante, for\r\ninstance, ever know of the drolleries of Sam Weller? Fancy a\r\n_spiritual_ Frenchman trying to catch the fun of Pickwick!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Judd's _Richard Edney_ induces a German critic to say of him,\r\n\"This is a new English poet of the Carlyle and Emerson school, who,\r\ninspired by the example of Jean Paul, turn the English language\r\ntopsy-turvy, and introduce a jargon that makes us satisfied with our\r\nown romantic barbarism.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMrs. S. C. HALL'S _Sorrows of Women_ has been also translated into\r\nGerman, and is highly praised.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Vienna, most of the recent publications have more or less relation\r\nto affairs. There is very little of pure literature. M. de Zsedenyi,\r\none of the most capable Hungarian political writers, has published a\r\nwork entitled _Responsibility of the Cabinet and the State of\r\nHungary_. The author of _The Genesis of the Revolution_, (supposed to\r\nbe Count Hartig, who was a Minister without portfolio under Prince\r\nMetternich) has again appeared before the public with 146 closely\r\nprinted pages of _Night Thoughts_, some of which had better never have\r\nseen the light of day. A Mr. Schwarz has published a work advocating\r\n\"protection,\" and in it he spares neither England nor the Austrian\r\nMinister of Commerce. Free trade notions have indeed been attacked in\r\na score of books by continental thinkers lately, and free trade\r\nopinions seem to have received, throughout Europe, a most decided\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe late Prince VALDIMAR, of Russia, made three or four years ago a\r\njourney to India, and besides taking part with the British army in\r\nsundry engagements, occupied himself busily in investigating the\r\nmanners and customs of the people, the antiquities, history, and\r\nnatural productions of the country. He wrote an account of his\r\njourney, and illustrated it with numerous drawings. His family is now\r\ncausing this to be printed and the drawings to be engraved, and in a\r\nshort time the work will be completed. Only three hundred copies are\r\nto be struck off, and they are to be presented to royal and\r\nillustrious personages. The getting up of the publication will cost\r\n40,000 thalers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. LEON DE MONBEILLARD has written a little treatise upon the _Ethics\r\nof Spinoza_, in which--being a spiritualist who admits the dogma of\r\nthe creation and of human personality--he is said to have refuted the\r\ngreat philosopher, yet without calumniating or disfiguring his\r\ndoctrines, and with a constant admiration of all that is truly\r\nadmirable in Spinoza.\r\n\r\nThe work has not yet crossed the sea, but we cannot help thinking that\r\nthe colossal views of so great a mind are not to be entirely disproved\r\nin the delicate dimensions of an \"_opuscule_,\" as the able little\r\ntreatise of M. Montbeillard is called by the critics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOSEPH RUSSEGGER, imperial director of the mines at Schemnitz, has\r\npublished the results of five years' travel in Europe, Asia, and\r\nAfrica, comprising a universal scientific and artistic as well as\r\nsocial and picturesque view of those countries. It is in four volumes,\r\nvery splendidly illustrated in all these departments, and is published\r\nat a cost of forty dollars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. DAVID FRIEDRICH STRAUSS, the famous rationalist, has published a\r\nwork entitled _Christian Marklein_, a picture of life and character\r\nfrom the present time, giving charming if not very new views of the\r\nWurtemberg theological schools.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the _German Universities_, it appears from the census just taken,\r\nwith the exceptions of those of Koenigsberg, Kiel, and Rostock, the\r\nnumbers for which have not been officially returned, there were for\r\nthe last term on the registers 11,945 students. The universities may\r\nbe classed, according to the number of students at each, in this\r\norder: Berlin, Munich, Bonn, Leipsic, Breslau, Tubingen, Goettingen,\r\nWurzburg, Halle, Heidelberg, Giessen, Erlangen, Friburg, Jena,\r\nMarburg, Greifswalde. Berlin has 2,107 students, and Greifswalde only\r\n189. The number studying the law is 3,973; of theological students,\r\n2,539; pursuing the study of philosophy and philology, 2,357; medical\r\nstudents, 2,146; and there are 549 engaged in political economy. Halle\r\nreckons the greatest proportional number of theological students,\r\nthere being 330 out of a total of 597; Heidelberg has most students of\r\nlaw; Wurzburg, most of medicine; and Jena, most students of theology.\r\nThe greatest numbers of foreign students are to be found at\r\nHeidelberg, Gottingen, Jena, Wurzburg, and Leipsic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Independence Belge_ gives an account of Frau Pfeiffer, a woman\r\nwho left Vienna several years ago to travel alone in the most distant\r\nand unfrequented parts of the world. After visiting Palestine and\r\nEgypt, Scandinavia and Iceland, she landed in Brazil, penetrated the\r\nprimitive forests, and lived among the natives; from Valparaiso she\r\ntraversed the Pacific to Otaheite, thence to China, Singapore, Ceylon,\r\nHindostan, to the caves of Adjunta and Ellora to Bombay, whence she\r\nsailed up the Tigris, to Bagdad, and then entered upon the arduous\r\njourney to Babylon, Nineveh, and into Kurdistan; and passing to the\r\nCaucasus, she embarked for Constantinople, visiting Greece in her way\r\nhome to Germany. She is now in London, visiting the Great Exposition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFERDINAND HILLER, Superintendent of the Cologne Musical Academy, and a\r\ncontemporary and friend of Mendelssohn, whom, in the beginning, it was\r\nsupposed he would surpass as a composer, has been recently in Paris,\r\nrenewing his old experiences. He saw there most of the famous literary\r\nand artistic notabilities, and gossips pleasantly about them in the\r\n_feuilleton_ of a German journal. He saw Henry Heine, whose body is\r\nalmost dead, but whose mind is as vigorous as ever. Hiller says that\r\nHeine chatted with him about God and himself, of the King of Prussia,\r\nand of Hiller--of the Frankfort Parliament and his own songs. Heine's\r\nfeatures, he says, are interesting, and even more beautiful than they\r\nwere formerly. The fallen cheeks leave the noble oval of the head and\r\nthe delicately chiselled nose mournfully apparent. The eyes are\r\nclosed. He can only see with the left, by elevating the lid with his\r\nfinger. He wears a close-trimmed beard, and his hair is as brown and\r\nluxuriant as ever. The slim white hand is ideally beautiful. It\r\nbelongs, according to the doctrine of Carns, to the class of the\r\npurely psychological. Heine had just written a song for a German\r\ncomposer; and that no poet can sing more sweetly for music, the many\r\nof his verses which Schubert has \"married to immortal\" tune\r\nsufficiently indicate. Mendelssohn also composed the most dreamily\r\ndelicate music to Heine's \"Moonlight on the Ganges.\"\r\n\r\nIngres, the painter, now seventy years old, the pride and model of the\r\nsevere classicists of the French school, is a comely old man, with\r\nrich dark hair, luminous eye, and smooth brow. He is still light and\r\nactive in movement, and a genial serenity broods over his whole\r\ncharacter and manner. His love of music is no less enthusiastic than\r\nthat of a lover for his mistress. The great German composers are great\r\ngods to Ingres. The remembrance of a beautiful sonata fills his eyes\r\nwith tears. Ingres has recently finished a portrait, which is not\r\ninferior to any thing he has ever done.\r\n\r\nOf musical men, Hiller saw Halevy, a successful composer and genial\r\ncompanion, with a gentle strain of irony in his conversation. Hector\r\nBerlioz has not grown to be fifty without some of the snowy tracks of\r\ntime, but the volcanic genius is still alive. His conversation is like\r\nan eruption, now a burning lava-stream of glowing inspiration, now\r\nsulphurous mockery and scorn, and now, wide-flying, a shower of sharp\r\nstones of criticism. He tells the most laughable stories of his London\r\nlife, and his musical difficulties and experiences there. In Paris he\r\nis only librarian of the \"Conservatoire,\" and director of great\r\nconcerts.\r\n\r\nJules Janin, the sparkling \"J. J.\" of the _Journal des Debats_, and\r\nthe grand seigneur of the Parisian _feuilletonistes_, leads the most\r\nloitering, pleasant life, and grows merry and fat thereby. He sits\r\nupon a luxurious ottoman, wrapped in a gorgeous _robe de chambre_, by\r\nthe fire-place of his beautifully adorned study, and there among his\r\nbooks and bijoux of taste and art, gives audience to all the world. He\r\nhas visits without end. He gives instruction and advice, hears all\r\nthat every body has to say, applauds extravagantly, as he writes, all\r\nthings in this world and some more, until it is time to go to dinner,\r\nor to see a new vaudeville. He has beside a beautiful wife, and\r\nsuffers with the gout. Could his cup be fuller?\r\n\r\nThe poet Beranger, too, who seems to Hiller the songfullest of\r\nsong-writers, charmed him by the gravity, and sweetness, and nobility\r\nof his character. Beranger received him quietly at Passy, near Paris,\r\nwhere he resides, a hale old man of more than seventy years. His hair\r\nis white, but his face has the freshness of blooming health. In his\r\nfeatures there is a remarkable blending of geniality and intelligent\r\nsharpness. They are largely moulded, and their general expression is\r\nas generous, fine, and graceful as his verses. The perfect simplicity\r\nof his household is very striking. The only hints of any luxury are\r\nsome medallion portraits, among which Hiller observed Napoleon and\r\nLamartine. Yet this severity is so evidently the result of taste and\r\nnot of poverty, that it has no unpleasant effect. The beauty and\r\nrichness of his conversation filled his visitor with the greatest\r\nregret that he could not record it all. His first great remembrance is\r\nthe destruction of the Bastille. His essay in literature was by the\r\nsongs which circulated universally in manuscript before they were\r\nprinted. But his literary ambition was toward works of great scope and\r\nextent, and it was not until after thirty years of age that he felt\r\ndistinctly what he could do best. Of his songs he said, \"I present to\r\nmyself a song, as a great composition--I sketch a complete plan,\r\nbeginning, middle, and end, and make the refrain the quintessence of\r\nthe whole.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Beranger was finding a letter, he opened a drawer, in which\r\nHiller saw scraps of song and sketches of poems, which he longed to\r\nseize, as a wistful boy would grab at the money piles in a banker's\r\nwindow. The following is the letter in which Beranger speaks of the\r\nMarseillaise:\r\n\r\n     \"I thank you, Madame, for the pleasant letter which you\r\n     addressed to me. It has revealed to me a noble heart, and\r\n     although I do not believe such hearts as rare as many say,\r\n     it is always a fair fortune to meet them.\r\n\r\n     \"What you say of the Marseillaise is entirely just. But\r\n     remember, Madame, that it is the people itself, which always\r\n     selects its songs, words, and melodies, uninfluenced by any\r\n     one in the world. Once made, this choice endures, with\r\n     authority even among the later generations, whose experience\r\n     would not have made it.\r\n\r\n     \"I have often enough thought about a new song of the kind,\r\n     but I am too old now, and the circumstances of the time have\r\n     robbed my voice of power. You, Madame, saw the true thought\r\n     of the song which should be now sung, and I lament that you\r\n     find the poetical harness not flexible enough for it.\r\n\r\n     \"As to your remarks upon my new songs, I must say that I\r\n     trouble myself as little about the destiny of my younger\r\n     daughters as about that of their elder sisters. And I am\r\n     surprised that you speak to me of a Lierman, who should have\r\n     known me. Excuse, Madame, my delay in acknowledging and\r\n     thanking you for your letter, and believe me your devoted,\r\n\r\n                                        BERANGER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA recent Italian translation of the _Diplomats and Diplomacy of\r\nItaly_, which first appeared in Professor Von Raumer's _Pocket Book_\r\nfor 1841, contains three hitherto unprinted MSS. from the Venetian\r\narchives. They are curious and interesting, as indicating the strict\r\nsurveillance which the republic maintained, by means of its\r\nambassadors, over the whole world of the period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. WILLIS'S _Hurry-Graphs_ have a French rival in the _Pensees d'un\r\nEmballeur_, by M. Commerson, chief editor of the _Tintamarre_ (Paris\r\njournal.) They are called fantastic, original and forcible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA work to create some surprise, coming from Spain, is the _Persecution\r\nof the Spanish Protestants by Philip the Second_, by Don ADOLPHO DE\r\nCASTRO. The name of Castro is honorably distinguished in Spanish\r\nliterature. The present author is a grandson, we believe, of Rodriguez\r\nde Castro, who wrote the BIBLIOTECA ESPANOLA. He displays abilities\r\nand a temper suitable for the task he attempted; he has joined to\r\ncareful and intelligent research a bravery of characterization which\r\nquite relieves his work from the censures which belong to most Spanish\r\ncompositions of its class. That he could print in Madrid a work in\r\nwhich statecraft and ecclesiastical persecutions are so frankly dealt\r\nwith, is a fact of more significance than a dozen such revolutions as\r\nhave vexed the slumbers of other states. In Spain, above all\r\ncountries, the spread of a taste for historical studies must be\r\nregarded as pregnant with important consequences. It shows that the\r\nbarriers of ignorance and self-conceit, which have so long isolated\r\nthat country from the rest of Europe, are beginning to be effectually\r\nbroken down. To the common Protestant reader, indeed, De Castro's work\r\nwill appear studiously moderate, or perhaps timid. But it should be\r\nremembered that it was written for a public which is four or five\r\ncenturies behind our own, in all that constitutes true liberty and\r\nenlightenment; and what would appear most gratuitous cowardice here\r\nmay easily enough be remarkable courage in Spain. To speak in favor of\r\nProtestantism at all, still more to become the biographer of the\r\nProtestant martyrs, is an undertaking which demands from a Spaniard,\r\neven of the present day, no ordinary amount of resolution. And we\r\nshould be by no means surprised to hear that De Castro has been, in\r\none way or another, made to pay some penalty of his rash enterprise.\r\nThat it is both a dangerous and an unpopular one is manifest from the\r\ncaution with which historical as well as religious topics are treated.\r\nCompiling what we cannot better characterize than as a Spanish\r\nsupplement to Fox's \"Book of Martyrs,\" the author nowhere professes\r\nhimself a Protestant. And the slow and gradual way in which he unmasks\r\nthe character of Philip II., shows how haughty and sensitive are the\r\npublic whom he has undertaken to disabuse of a portion of the\r\ninveterate pride and prejudice which they nourish on all subjects\r\naffecting their church or their country. On the whole, however, though\r\nthe Protestant reader will occasionally desiderate a little more\r\nwarmth and indignation when chronicling such atrocities, we should say\r\nthat the book rather gains than loses by this studied moderation both\r\nin tone and opinions. It certainly gains in dignity and\r\nimpressiveness; and it is vastly better adapted to make its way with\r\nthe author's countrymen, than if he had betrayed at the outset a\r\nsectarian bias, which would have revolted them, before they had time\r\nto make acquaintance with the sad and sanguinary events of which he is\r\nthe historian. The ground gone over is necessarily much the same as in\r\nM'Crie's _History of the Reformation in Spain_, a work which possibly\r\nsuggested the undertaking, and to which De Castro gives due credit for\r\nlearning and ability. His advantage over the Scottish historian\r\nconsists in his command of a variety of documents in print and in\r\nmanuscript, to which access could be had only in Spain, especially the\r\npublications of the Spanish reformers themselves, which are\r\nexceedingly rare in consequence of the pains taken to destroy them by\r\nthe Inquisition. The most remarkable result obtained by De Castro's\r\nresearches, and the feature in his work for which he claims the\r\ngreatest credit is the new light he has thrown on the history of Don\r\nCarlos. But unfortunately the question as to the Protestantism of that\r\nprince remains in much the same obscurity as before. His having been\r\ntainted by heretical opinions would aid certainly in accounting for\r\nhis father's malignity towards him; but otherwise there seems to be no\r\nproof of the fact; and our own opinion is, that his tolerant views as\r\nto the treatment of the Flemish provinces were misconstrued into bias\r\ntowards Protestant doctrines. The inference relied on by De Castro and\r\nothers, that if he had remained Catholic he must have shared his\r\nfather's extravagant bigotry, is lame. Don Carlos did no more than\r\nfollow the usual course of heirs apparent when he disapproved of his\r\nfather's tyranny; and his sympathies with Aragon are not less marked\r\nthan those with Flanders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLONGWORTH, who distinguished himself in the Hungarian troubles, is\r\nwriting a history of them. There is promise of so many books upon the\r\nsubject that we shall be able to find out nothing about it. By the\r\nway, we wonder that no one has yet chosen for a motto to place upon\r\nhis title-page, this sentence, which Lord Bolingbroke wrote more than\r\na hundred years ago:\r\n\r\n     \"_I mean to speak of the troubles in Hungary. Whatever they\r\n     become in their progress, they were caused originally by the\r\n     usurpations and persecutions of the emperor. And when the\r\n     Hungarians were called rebels first, they were called so for\r\n     no other reason than this, that they would not be slaves_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is from his _Letters on History_, and occurs where he has been\r\nspeaking of the hostility of foreign powers to Austria.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA PENNY MAGAZINE, in the Bengalese language, is to be established in\r\nCalcutta, under the editorship of Baboo Rajendralal Mittra, the\r\nlibrarian of the Asiatic Society. It is to be illustrated by\r\nelectrotypes executed in England, of woodcuts which have already\r\nappeared in the _Penny Magazine_, the _Saturday Magazine_, and the\r\n_Illustrated News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA NATIVE of India has translated the tragedy of _Othello_ into\r\nBengalee Othello's cognomen in the Oriental version is Moor Bahadoor\r\n(General Moor).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN ITALY, at Turin and Florence, a great number of valuable works have\r\nbeen issued, illustrative of the recent revolutions. They do not claim\r\nto be histories, for history is impossible, while events are\r\ncontemporary and cannot be contemplated from a universal point of\r\nprinciple and analysis. But these volumes are what the French with\r\ntheir happy facility would call studies for history. They are the\r\nmaterial from which the great historic artists must compose their\r\npictures--they are the diary of the movement--they follow all the\r\nchanges of the time, hopeful or despondent, with the fidelity and\r\ncloseness of an Indian upon the trail. We have seen several of these\r\npublications, and hope ere many months to see a treatise upon the\r\nrepublican movement in Europe from a pen well able to sketch it, and\r\nwhich is fed by ink which is never for a moment red.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most important of these works is that of M. Gualterio,\r\njust published in Florence, which comprises several letters of the\r\nAustrian lackey, Francis IV., Duke of Modenas, and throws light upon\r\nmany of the darkest passages of the dark Austria-Italico policy. Among\r\nother letters, also, one of the most remarkable is that of the\r\nCardinal Gonsalvi, well known as the able and humane Prime Minister of\r\nPius VII., and to whose memory there is now upon the walls of St.\r\nPeter's a monument by Thorwaldsen, of which a statue of the Cardinal\r\nis part. This letter speaks of the miserable conduct of the political\r\ntrials, and \"justice,\" he says, \"charity, the most ordinary decency\r\ndemands that all humanity shall not be so trampled under foot. What\r\nwill the English and French journals say--not the Austrian, when they\r\nlearn of this massacre of the innocents.\" This was thirty years ago.\r\nBut at this moment, were there an able and humane minister at the\r\nVatican, how truly might he repeat Gonsalvi's words!\r\n\r\nIt is in works like these, and in the journals and pamphlets published\r\nduring the intensity of the struggle, that the still-surviving Italian\r\ngenius, which it has been so long the northern policy to smother and\r\nrepress, betrayed itself. Nor among these works, as striking another\r\nkey, ought we to omit the Souvenirs of the War of Lombardy by M. de\r\nTalleyrand-Perigord. Duke of Dino--and the history of the Revolution\r\nof Rome by Alphonse Balleydier. The Souvenirs are devoted to the glory\r\nof the unhappy King Charles Albert, the dupe of his own vanity and the\r\nvictim of his own weakness.\r\n\r\nUpon the pages of M. le Duc de Dino, however, he blazes very\r\nbrilliantly as a martyr--martyr of a cause hopeless even in the first\r\nflush of success--martyr of an army without enthusiasm, of a\r\nliberalism without freedom or heroism. The English royalists, the\r\nreader will remember, were fond of the same title for the unhappy\r\nCharles I.\r\n\r\nIn M. Balleydier's history of the Roman revolution, Rossi is the\r\ncentral figure, in whose fate there was something extremely heroic,\r\nbecause he had received information, just as he quitted the Pope's\r\npalace to go to the assembly, from a priest who had heard it in\r\nconfidence, that he was to be attacked, and he must have known the\r\nItalian, and especially the Roman character, sufficiently to have felt\r\nassured of his fate. After hearing the priest, Rossi said to him\r\ncalmly: \"I thank you, Monseigneur, the cause of the Pope is the cause\r\nof God,\" and stepping into his carriage drove to the palace of the\r\nCancelleria, at whose door he fell dead, by a stroke that wounded much\r\nmore mortally the cause which condemned him, than the cause he\r\nespoused.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith all our waste of money, and continual boasts of encouraging\r\nindividual merit, we have not yet a single pension in this country\r\nexcept to homicides. \"They manage these things better in France.\" A\r\nreturn just published in the official _Moniteur_, shows that one\r\ndepartment of the government, that of Public Instruction, distributes\r\nthe following pensions to literary persons: five of from $400 to $480\r\na year; nine of $300 to $360; twenty-nine of $200 to $240; thirty-four\r\nof $120 to $180; and fifteen of $40 to $100. To the widows and\r\nfamilies of deceased authors, two of $400 to $450; six of $300 to\r\n$360; seventeen of $200 to $240; twenty-five of $120 to $180; and\r\nthirty-one of $40 to $100. In addition to this, it may be mentioned,\r\nthat the same department distributes a large sum annually, under the\r\ntitle of \"Encouragements,\" to authors in temporary distress, or\r\nengaged in works of literary importance and but small pecuniary\r\nprofit. It also awards several thousands to learned societies, for\r\nliterary and scientific missions, purchases of books, &c. The\r\ndepartment of the Interior gives $2,500 a year in subscriptions to\r\ndifferent works, and nearly $30,000 for \"indemnities and assistance to\r\nauthors.\" The other departments of the government also employ\r\nconsiderable sums in purchasing books, and in otherwise encouraging\r\nliterary men. It is said indeed to be no unusual thing for an author,\r\nlaboring under temporary inconvenience, to apply for a few hundred,\r\nor, in some cases, thousand francs, and they are almost always\r\nawarded. No shame whatever is attached to the application, and no very\r\nextraordinary credit to the gift. Surely, France must be a Paradise\r\nfor authors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA BOOKSELLER in Paris announces: \"Reflections upon my conversations\r\nwith the Duke de la Vauguyon, by Louis-Augustus Dauphin, (Louis XVI.,)\r\naccompanied by a fac simile of the MS., and with an introduction by M.\r\nFALLOUX, formerly Minister of Public Instruction.\" Falloux is a\r\nchurchman of the stamp of Montalembert. We are apt to doubt the\r\ngenuineness of these luckily discovered MSS. of eminent persons. We\r\nhave no more faith in this case than we had in that of the Napoleon\r\nnovels, mentioned in the last _International_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe late M. De BALZAC, who, besides being one of the cleverest writers\r\nof the age, was a brilliant man of society, and a very notorious\r\n_roue_, left, it appears, voluminous memoirs, to be printed without\r\nerasure or addition, and his friends are much alarmed by the prospect\r\nof their appearance. It is said that his custom of extorting letters\r\nfrom his friends upon any subject at issue, under pretence of\r\npossessing an imperfect memory, and his method of classing them, will\r\nrender his memoirs one of the completest scandalous _tableaux_ of the\r\nnineteenth century that could ever be presented to the contemplation\r\nof another age. Opposition to the publication has already been\r\noffered, but without success, and the princess-widow is busily engaged\r\nwith the preparations for printing, intending to have the memoirs\r\nbefore the world early in June. They extend minutely over more than\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. E. QUINET, who was long associated with Michelet, in the College of\r\nFrance, and who is known as a writer by his _Alemagne et Italie,\r\nUltramontanisme, Vacances en Espagne_, etc. has published in Paris\r\n_L'Enseignement du Peuple_. \"On the 24th day of February, 1848,\" he\r\nsays, \"a social miracle places in the hands of France the control of\r\nits destiny. France, openly consulted, replies by taking up a position\r\nin the scale of nations between Portugal and Naples. There must be a\r\ncause of this voluntary servitude; the object of these pages is to\r\ndiscover this cause, and, if possible, to protect futurity against the\r\neffects of its operation.\" This is the problem he proposes to solve,\r\nand he concludes that the important secret is in the fact, that the\r\n\"national religion is in direct contradiction with the national\r\nrevolution.\" \"Chained by the circumstance of its religion to the\r\nmiddle ages, France believes that it can march onward to the end of a\r\ncareer opened to it solely because of its protest against every great\r\nprinciple of government which those ages held sacred.\" He has worked\r\nten years, he tells us, to demonstrate two things: The first, that\r\ncatholic states are all perishing; the second, that no political\r\nliberty can be realized in those states. \"I have shown,\" he continues,\r\n\"Italy the slave of all Europe, Spain a slave within, Portugal a slave\r\nwithin and without, Ireland a slave to England, Poland a slave to\r\nRussia, Bohemia, Hungary, slaves of Austria--Austria herself, the\r\nmother of all slavery, a slave to Russia. Looking for similar proofs\r\nout of Europe, I have shown in America, on the one hand, the\r\nincreasing greatness of the heretical United States; on the other\r\nhand, the slavery of the catholic democracies and monarchies of the\r\nsouth: _in the former a_ WASHINGTON, _in the second a_ ROSAS.\" M.\r\nQuinet considers that the only remedy applicable to an evil of this\r\nmagnitude is the utter separation of church and state. Leave but the\r\nslightest connection between the two, and the former will inevitably\r\noverpower the latter. The one is a compact, organized, single-minded\r\nbody; the other is scattered, loosely put together, swayed to and fro\r\nby every change in the political atmosphere, and can offer no\r\nresistance that is sufficient to oppose the steady, unremittent\r\nattacks of its enemy. The two, therefore, must not be placed in\r\ncollision. The very indifference manifested towards the national\r\nreligion by the great bulk of the French people is the cause why so\r\nmuch danger is to be apprehended from the efforts of the church.\r\nBecause a religion is dead, says M. Quinet, there is the danger. A\r\nliving religion, like that of the puritans, may certainly mould the\r\ngovernment into a despotic form, but it communicates to it, at least,\r\na portion of its own power and energy, whilst a dead religion\r\ninfallibly occasions death to the state and to the people with which\r\nit is politically and organically united. He argues the whole subject\r\nwith eloquent force, and with not a little of the earnestness which\r\nreminds the reader of his personal controversies with the Roman\r\nCatholic Church.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA history of _Marie Stuart_, by I. M. Dargaud, has just been published\r\nin Paris, and for its brilliancy, completeness, clearness, and\r\nimpartiality, attracts much attention. Queen Mary of Scotland was one\r\nof the famously beautiful women whose history is romance. She must be\r\nnamed with the heroines of history and the figures of poetry, with\r\nHelen, and Aspasia, and Cleopatra. Certainly, we trace no more\r\nsparkling and sorrowful career than hers upon the confused page of\r\nhistory, and our admiration, condemnation, surprise, sorrow and\r\ndelight, fall, summed in a tear, upon her grave. In this work it\r\nappears that she was undoubtedly privy to the death of Darnley. During\r\nhis assassination, she was dancing at Holyrood. The fearful\r\nfascination of a brigand like Bothwell, for so proud and passionate a\r\nnature as Mary's, is well explained by M. Dargaud. He is just, also,\r\nto her own tragedy, the long and bitter suffering, the betrayal of\r\nfriends; the final despair, and the laying aside two crowns to mount\r\nthe scaffold. She died nobly, and as most of the illustrious victims\r\nof history have died; as if nature, unwilling that they should live,\r\nwould yet compassionately show the world in their ending, that heroism\r\nand nobility were not altogether unknown to them.\r\n\r\n_Apropos_ of this history of Queen Mary, Lamartine has written a\r\nletter to Beranger, which praises the work exceedingly, but much more\r\nglorifies himself. The letter is a perfect specimen of that vanity,\r\nwherein only Lamartine is sublime: \"Ah! if you or I had had such a\r\nheroine at twenty years, what epic poems and what songs would have\r\nbeen the result!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE COUNT MONTALEMBERT, the fervid champion of Catholicism in the\r\nFrench chamber, has just published a work, entitled _The higher and\r\nlower Radicalism: in its enmity to Religion, Right, Freedom and\r\nJustice, in France, Switzerland and Italy_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough M. GUIZOT appears to be as busily engaged as ever in\r\npolitics, the advertisements of the booksellers would induce a belief\r\nthat his whole attention is given to literary studies. He has just\r\npublished _Etudes Biographiques sur la Revolution de l'Angleterre_,\r\nwhich, with his sketch of General Monk, he says, \"form a sort of\r\ngallery of portraits of the English Revolution, in which personages of\r\nthe most different characters appear together--chiefs or champions of\r\nsects or parties, parliamentarians, cavaliers, republicans, levellers,\r\nwho, either at the end of the political conflicts in which they were\r\nengaged, or when in retirement towards the close of their lives,\r\nresolved to describe themselves, their own times, and the part they\r\nplayed therein. In the drawing together of such men,\" he adds, \"and in\r\nthe mixture of truth and vanity which characterize such works, there\r\nis, if I do not deceive myself, sufficient to interest persons of\r\nserious and curious minds, especially among us and in these times; for\r\nin spite of the profound diversity of manners, contemporary\r\ncomparisons and applications will present themselves at every step,\r\nwhatever may be the pains taken not to seek them.\" The studies here\r\ncollected we suppose are not new; they are doubtless the articles\r\nwhich the author contributed to the _Biographie Universelle_ and other\r\nworks before he became a minister--perhaps, as in the cases of his\r\n\"Monk\" and \"Washington,\" with scarcely a word of alteration. The work\r\nis, however, interesting. The period of English history to which it\r\nrefers has been profoundly studied by Guizot, and it would probably be\r\nimpossible to select a mode of treating it that would admit of more\r\neffective or attractive delineation. The life of Ludlow appears as the\r\nfirst of the series.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrench Literature tends in a remarkable degree towards monarchical\r\ninstitutions. Guizot and his associates publicly advocate the\r\nRestoration. M. Cousin has published a new argument against\r\nRepublicanism, and M. Romieu, whose curious book, which men doubted\r\nwhether to receive as a jest or an earnest argument, _The Era of the\r\nCaesars_--in which he declared his belief that the true and only law\r\nfor France is _force_--is before the public again, in a volume\r\nentitled _Le Spectre Rouge de 1852_. He predicts the subversion of all\r\norder, and such terrible scenes as have never been witnessed even in\r\nFrance, unless some one bold, resolute, scorning all \"constitutional\"\r\nfigments, and relying solely on his soldiers--some one who shall say\r\n_L'etat c'est moi!_ shall save France. A Cromwell, a Francia, or in\r\ndefault of such Louis Napoleon--any one who will constitute himself an\r\nautocrat, will become the saviour of France!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe COUNT DE JARNAC, formerly secretary and _charge d'affaires_ of the\r\nFrench embassy in London, has published a novel which is well spoken\r\nof, entitled the _Dernier d'Egmont_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA French traveller in upper Egypt has collected for the Parisian\r\nEthnological Museum copies of many curious inscriptions upon the walls\r\nof the great temple of Philae. Among others, there is the modern one of\r\nDessaix, which the Parisians think \"reflects the grandiose simplicity\r\nof the Republic.\" \"The sixth year of the Republic, the thirteenth\r\nMessidor, a French army commanded by Bonaparte descended upon\r\nAlexandria; twenty days after, the army having routed the Mamelukes at\r\nthe Pyramids, Dessaix, commanding the first division, pursued them\r\nbeyond the Cataracts, where he arrived the thirteenth Ventose of the\r\nyear seven, with Brigadier-Generals Davoust, Friant, and Belliard.\r\nDonzelot, chief of the staff, La Tournerie, commanding the artillery,\r\nEppler, Chief of the twenty-first Light Infantry. The thirteenth\r\nVentose, year seven of the Republic, third March, year of J.C., 1799.\r\nEngraved by Casteix.\" The last date, however, strikes us as a base\r\ncompromise to the _temporal_ prejudices of the world, on the part of\r\nthe author of this \"simple and grandiose\" inscription.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. de Saint Beauve has published in Paris some hitherto inedited MSS.\r\nof MIRABEAU, consisting of _Dialogues_ between the great orator and\r\nthe celebrated Sophie (Madame de Monnier), written when Mirabeau was\r\nconfined in the fortress of Vincennes, principally, it seems, from the\r\npleasure he had in reflecting on the object of his passion. He gives\r\nan account of their first meeting, the growth of their love, and their\r\nsubsequent adventures, in the language, no doubt, as well as he could\r\nrecollect, that had passed between them, in conversation or in\r\nletters. There is not much that is absolutely new in these papers, or\r\nthat throws any peculiar light on Mirabeau's character, but nothing\r\ncould have been written by him which is without a certain interest,\r\nespecially upon the subject of these _Dialogues_. Circulating-library\r\npeople had always a morbid desire to see illustrious personages while\r\nunder the influence of the tender passion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Progression Constante de la Democratie pendant soixante ans_, is the\r\ntitle of a new Parisian brochure well noticed. Of the same character\r\nis the _Le Mont-Saint-Michel_, by Martin Bernard, a serial publication\r\ndevoted to the details of the sufferings of Democratic martyrs. The\r\nauthor is now in exile, having shown himself too republican for the\r\npresent Republic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo's paper, _L'Evenement_, says of Louis Philippe's Gallery\r\nat the Palais Royal, which the heirs now wish to sell, that it has two\r\npaintings of Gericault's, the Chasseur and the Cuirassier, and that\r\nthey symbolize the two phases of the Empire, victorious France and the\r\nInvasion. He hopes, therefore, that they will not be permitted to go\r\nout of France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWilliam Howitt is writing a life of George Fox.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Ticknor's _History of Spanish Literature_ is reviewed in _La Revue\r\ndes Deux Mondes_ by PROSPER MERIMEE, of whose recent travels in the\r\nUnited States we have had occasion to speak once or twice in _The\r\nInternational_. M. Merimee is the author of a _Life of Peter the\r\nCruel_, of which a translation has been published within a few months\r\nby Bentley in London, and he professes to be thoroughly acquainted\r\nwith Spanish literature, from a loving study of it while residing in\r\nSpain. Perhaps he had some thought of writing its history himself; he\r\ncertainly seems to bestow unwillingly the praises he is compelled to\r\ngive Mr. Ticknor, whose extraordinary merits he however distinctly\r\nadmits. \"The writer of this History,\" he says, \"has gone into immense\r\nresearches; he has applied himself deeply and conscientiously to the\r\nCastilian language and the Spanish authors: he has read, he has\r\nexamined, every thing that the English, French, and Germans, had\r\npublished on this subject. He possessed an advantage over the critics\r\nof old Europe--that of being able to treat literary questions without\r\nmixing up with them recollections of national rivalries.\" He concludes\r\nhis article by saying, \"This work is an inestimable repertory; it must\r\nbe eminently useful in a library. It comprises very good biographical\r\nnotices of the Spanish authors, and numerous abstracts which obviate\r\nthe necessity of reference to the original authorities. The\r\ntranslations, which are copious, are executed with surpassing taste,\r\nto afford an idea of the style of the Spanish poets. Thanks to the\r\nflexibility of the English language, and the ability or command of the\r\nauthor in using it, the translations are of signal fidelity and\r\nelegance. The rhythm, the flow, the idiomatic grace and _curiosa\r\nfelicitas_, are rendered in the most exact and the happiest manner.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy a letter in the London _Times_, signed ERNESTO SUSANNI, it appears\r\nthat M. LIBRI may be a very much wronged person. The readers of the\r\n_International_ will remember his trial, a few months ago, and his\r\ncondemnation to ten years' imprisonment (in default of judgment), and\r\ndeprivation of the various high offices he held, for having, as was\r\nalleged, stolen from the Mazarine Library, besides others, the\r\nfollowing volumes: _Petrarca, gli Triomphi_, 1475: Bologna, in folio;\r\n_Pamphyli poetae lepidissimi Epigrammatum libri quatuor; Faccio degli\r\nUberti, opera chiamata Ditta Munde Venezia_, 1501, quarto; _Phalaris\r\nEpistole, traducte del Latino da Bartol: Fontio_, 1471, quarto;\r\n_Dante, Convivio_: Florence, 1490, quarto; &c. M. Susanni alleges that\r\nthe learned bibliographer, M. Silvestre, has discovered in the\r\nMazarine Library that, contrary to the very circumstantial affirmation\r\nof the deed of accusation, the above-mentioned books _are still in\r\ntheir places on the shelves of that library_, from which they have\r\nnever been absent, and where any one may go and see them, and verify\r\nthe fact for himself. The persons employed to draw up the charges\r\nagainst M. Libri never appeared to understand that two different\r\neditions of a work were totally different things, and they have\r\naccused M. Libri of having stolen a work from a public library, simply\r\nbecause M. Libri possessed an edition of that work, though different\r\nfrom the one the library had lost, or, better still, which it had\r\nnever lost at all. Considering all the circumstances, and the\r\nattention which was attracted to the case throughout the learned\r\nworld, this is very curious: it will form one of the most remarkable\r\nof the _causes celebres_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe new Paris review, _La Politique Nouvelle_, starts bravely its\r\ncareer as a rival of _La Revue des Deux Mondes_. The leading article,\r\n\"La Constitution, c'est l'order,\" is by M. Marie, who was one of the\r\nchiefs of the Provisional Government, and Henri Martin, Gustave\r\nCazavan, and Paul Rochery, are among the contributors; but the best\r\nattraction of the work to those who do not care for its politics, is\r\nthe beginning of a charming novel by Madame Charles Reybaud, the\r\nauthoress of Tales of the Old Convents of Paris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLamartine's reputation declines with every new attempt of his at\r\nmoney-making. There was never a man capable of doing well a half of\r\nwhat he advertises. He is writing a romance on the destruction of the\r\nJanizaries, for the _Pays_, another romance for the _Siecle_, and\r\noccasionally gives _feuilletons_ to other journals; he is re-editing a\r\ncomplete edition of his own works, writing a history of the\r\nRestoration, and a history of Turkey, and has lately begun to edit a\r\ndaily paper. He also continues the monthly pamphlet, of between thirty\r\nand forty pages, the _Conseiller du Peuple_, on political matters, and\r\nproduces once a month a periodical, _Les Foyers du Peuple_, in which\r\nhe gives an account of his travels, with tales and verses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Paris correspondent of the London _Literary Gazette_ states, that\r\nan Assyrian, named FURIS SCHYCYAC, is at present attracting some\r\nattention in the literary circles. He had just arrived from London,\r\nwhere, it appears, he translated the Bible into Arabic, for one of the\r\nreligious associations. He has accompanied his _debut_ in\r\nParisian society with a _mudh_, or poem, to Paris, in which he almost\r\nout-Orientals the Orientals in his exaggerated compliments and\r\ngorgeous imagery. Paris, he declares, amongst other things, is the\r\n\"terrestrial paradise,\" the \"_sejour_ of houris,\" and \"Eden;\" whilst\r\nthe people are, _par excellence_, \"the strong, the generous, the\r\nbrave, the sincere-hearted, with no faults to diminish their virtues.\"\r\nThis master-stroke has opened the Parisian circles to the cunning\r\nAssyrian.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. Leroux has published in Paris a volume of Reminiscences of Travel\r\nand Residence in the United States, with observations on the\r\nAdministration of Justice in this country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last _Edinburgh Review_ has an article on COUSIN, in which a\r\ngeneral survey is taken of his life and of his works, of which he has\r\njust completed the publication of a new edition. The _London Leader_\r\nsays that the critic ingeniously represents all Cousin's plagiarisms\r\nas the consequences of the progressive and _assimilative_ intellect of\r\nthe eclectic chief; that it would be easy with the same facts to tell\r\na very different story; and correct the reviewer's \"mistake,\" where he\r\ntalks of Cousin as the translator of Plato. Cousin's name is on the\r\ntitle-page; but not one dialogue, the _Leader_ avers, did he\r\ntranslate; it even doubts his ability to translate one. What he did\r\nwas to take old translations by De Grow and others, here and there\r\npolishing the style; and the dialogues that were untranslated he gave\r\nto certain clever young men in want of employment and glad of his\r\npatronage. He touched up their style and wrote the Preface to each\r\nDialogue, for which the work bears his name! _This_ explains the\r\npuzzling fact that the translator of Plato should so completely\r\nmisunderstand the purpose of the dialogue he is prefacing. Gigantic\r\nindeed would be the labors of Cousin--if he performed them himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWalter Savage Landor is now seventy-six years of age. He writes no\r\nmore great works, but he is hardly less industrious than a\r\npenny-a-liner in writing upon all sorts of subjects for the journals.\r\nWe find his communications almost every week in _The Examiner_, _The\r\nNews_, _The Leader_, _Leigh Hunt's Journal_, and other periodicals.\r\nSometimes he rises to his earlier eloquence, and we hear the voice\r\nthat was loudest and sweetest in the \"Imaginary Conversations;\" but\r\nfor the most part his newspaper pieces are feeble and splenetic,\r\nunworthy of him. One of his latest composures has relation to Lord\r\nLyndhurst, by whose speech against the revolutionary aliens in England\r\nhad been excited the ire of the old poet. \"In your paper of this day,\r\nApril 12,\" he writes to the editor of _The Examiner_, \"I find repeated\r\nan expression of Lord Lyndhurst's, which I am certain will be\r\noffensive to many of your readers. General Klapka, a man illustrious\r\nfor his military knowledge, and for his application of it to the\r\ndefence of his country and her laws, is contemptuously called _one_\r\nKlapka. The most obscure and the most despicable (and those only) are\r\nthus designated. Surely to have been called by the acclamations of a\r\nwhole people to defend the most important of its fortresses is quite\r\nas exalted a distinction as to be appointed a Lord Chamberlain or a\r\nLord Chancellor by the favor of one minister, and liable to be\r\ndismissed the next morning by another. With all proper respect for the\r\ncleverness of Lord Lyndhurst, I must entreat your assistance in\r\ndiscovering one sentence he ever wrote, or spoke, denoting the man of\r\nlofty genius or capacious mind. Memorable things he certainly has\r\nsaid--such as calling by the name of aliens a third part of our\r\nfellow-subjects in these islands, and by the prefix of a _certain_ to\r\nthe name of Klapka. It is strange that sound law should not always be\r\nsound sense; strange that the great seal of equity should make so\r\nfaint and indistinct an impression. Klapka will be commemorated and\r\nrenowned in history as one beloved by the people, venerated by the\r\nnobility; whose voice was listened to attentively by the magistrate,\r\nenthusiastically by the soldier. The fame of Lord Lyndhurst is\r\nephemeral, confined to the Court of Chancery and the House of Peers;\r\ndozens have shared it in each, and have gone to dinner and oblivion.\r\nThose, and those alone, are great men whose works or words are\r\ndestined to be the heirlooms of many generations. God places them\r\nwhere time passes them without erasing their footsteps. Kings can\r\nnever make them. They, if minded so, could more easily make kings.\r\nEngland hath installed one Chancellor who might have been consummately\r\ngreat, had there only been in his composition the two simple elements\r\nof generosity and honesty. Bacon did not hate freedom, or the friends\r\nof freedom; and, although he cautiously kept clear of so dangerous a\r\nvicinity, he never came voluntarily forth, invoking the vindictive\r\nspirit of a dead law to eliminate them in the hour of adversity from\r\ntheir sanctuary.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Moses Margoliouth, who was once a Jew, and who last year\r\npublished a narrative of a journey to Palestine, under the title of \"A\r\nVisit to the Land of My Fathers,\" has just given to the world, in\r\nthree octavos, a _History of the Jews in Great Britain_. The book is\r\ninsufferably tame and feeble; the author is of the class called in\r\nEngland \"religious flunkies:\" a mastiff to the poor and a spaniel to\r\nthe proud. His first book was disgusting for its feebleness and\r\nservility, and this is scarcely better, notwithstanding the richness\r\nof its materials and the curious interest of its subject. A good\r\nHistory of the Jews in England will be a work worth reading.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Ecclesiastical History Society_ have published in London\r\n_Strype's Memorials of Cranmer_, _Heylyn's History of the\r\nReformation_, and _Field's Treatise of the Church_. Strype and Heylyn\r\nare more familiar than Field, whose work is a sort of supplement to\r\nHooker's _Polity_. Field resembled his illustrious master and friend\r\nin judgment, temper, and learning. In his own day his reputation was\r\ngreat. James I. regretted, when he heard of his death, that he had not\r\ndone more for him; Hall, in reference to his own deanery of Worcester,\r\nwhich had been sought for Field, speaks of that \"better-deserving\r\ndivine,\" who \"was well satisfied with greater hopes;\" and Fuller, with\r\nhis accustomed humor of thoughtfulness, bestows his salutation on\r\n\"that learned divine whose memory smelleth like a _field_ that the\r\nLord hath blessed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF WORDSWORTH, by Dr. Christopher Wordsworth, has appeared in\r\nLondon, and with some additions by Professor Henry Reed, of\r\nPhiladelphia, will soon be issued by Ticknor, Reed & Fields, of\r\nBoston. From what the critics write of it we suspect it is a poor\r\naffair. The _Leader_ says that, \"all things considered, it is perhaps\r\nthe worst biographical attempt\" it \"ever waded through.\" The\r\n_Examiner_ and other leading papers admit its dulness as a biography,\r\nand its worthlessness in criticism, but claim for it a certain value\r\nas a collection of facts respecting the histories of Wordsworth's\r\ndifferent poems. The work indeed professes to be no more than a\r\nbiographical commentary on the poet's writings. It does not even\r\naffect to be critical, or to offer any labored exposition of the\r\nprinciples on which Wordsworth's poems were composed. The author\r\ndescribes his illustrious relative as having had no desire that any\r\nsuch disquisition should be written. \"He wished that his poems should\r\nstand by themselves, and plead their own cause before the tribunal of\r\nposterity.\" Strictly, then, the volumes are so exclusively subordinate\r\nand ministerial to the poetry they illustrate, that apart from the\r\nlatter they possess hardly any interest. By enthusiasts for the poems\r\nthey will be eagerly read, but to any other class of readers we cannot\r\nsee that they present attraction. Dr. Wordsworth's part in them,\r\nthough small, is not particularly well done; and the poet's part\r\nalmost exclusively consists of personal memoranda connected with his\r\npoems dictated in later life, and seldom by any chance refers to any\r\nthing but himself.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there are in the volumes many delightful and\r\ncharacteristic details, much genuine and beautiful criticism (chiefly\r\nin the poet's letters), and occasional passages of fine sentiment and\r\npure philosophy. Here is Wordsworth's own description of one of his\r\nlatest visits to London, and of his appearance at court, in a letter\r\nto an American correspondent:\r\n\r\n\"My absence from home lately was not of more than three weeks. I took\r\nthe journey to London solely to pay my respects to the Queen, upon my\r\nappointment to the laureateship upon the decease of my friend Mr.\r\nSouthey. The weather was very cold, and I caught an inflammation in\r\none of my eyes, which rendered my stay in the south very\r\nuncomfortable. I nevertheless did, in respect to the object of my\r\njourney, all that was required. The reception given me by the Queen at\r\nher ball was most gracious. Mrs. Everett, the wife of your minister,\r\namong many others, was a witness to it, without knowing who I was. It\r\nmoved her to the shedding of tears. This effect was in part produced,\r\nI suppose, by American habits of feeling, as pertaining to a\r\nrepublican government. To see a gray-haired man of seventy-five years\r\nof age, kneeling down in a large assembly to kiss the hand of a young\r\nwoman, is a sight for which institutions essentially democratic do not\r\nprepare a spectator of either sex, and must naturally place the\r\nopinions upon which a republic is founded, and the sentiments which\r\nsupport it, in strong contrast with a government based and upheld as\r\nours is. I am not, therefore, surprised that Mrs. Everett was moved,\r\nas she herself described to persons of my acquaintance, among others\r\nto Mr. Rogers the poet. By the by, of this gentleman, now I believe in\r\nhis eighty-third year, I saw more than of any other person except my\r\nhost, Mr. Moxon, while I was in London. He is singularly fresh and\r\nstrong for his years, and his mental faculties (with the exception of\r\nhis memory a little) not at all impaired. It is remarkable that he and\r\nthe Rev. W. Bowles were both distinguished as poets when I was a\r\nschoolboy, and they have survived almost all their eminent\r\ncontemporaries, several of whom came into notice long after them.\r\nSince they became known, Burns, Cowper, Mason the author of\r\n'Caractacus' and friend of Gray, have died. Thomas Warton, Laureate,\r\nthen Byron, Shelley, Keats, and a good deal later Scott, Coleridge,\r\nCrabbe, Southey, Lamb, the Ettrick Shepherd, Cary the translator of\r\nDante, Crowe the author of 'Lewesdon Hill,' and others of more or less\r\ndistinction, have disappeared. And now of English poets advanced in\r\nlife, I cannot recall any but James Montgomery, Thomas Moore, and\r\nmyself, who are living, except the octogenarian with whom I began. I\r\nsaw Tennyson, when I was in London, several times. He is decidedly the\r\nfirst of our living poets, and I hope will live to give the world\r\nstill better things. You will be pleased to hear that he expressed in\r\nthe strongest terms his gratitude to my writings. To this I was far\r\nfrom indifferent, though persuaded that he is not much in sympathy\r\nwith what I should myself most value in my attempts, viz., the\r\nspirituality with which I have endeavored to invest the material\r\nuniverse, and the moral relations under which I have wished to exhibit\r\nits most ordinary appearances.\"\r\n\r\nOf the mention of Alfred Tennyson in the foregoing extract the\r\n_Examiner_ remarks, that it is perhaps the greatest stretch of\r\nappreciation or acknowledgment in regard to any living or contemporary\r\npoet in Wordsworth. His mention of Southey's verses is always reserved\r\nand dry. He takes no pains to conceal his poor opinion of Scott's. His\r\nallusions to Rogers are respectful, but cold. His objection to Byron\r\nmay be forgiven. There is less reason for his appearing quite to lose\r\nhis ordinarily calm temper when Goethe is even named, or for his\r\nextending this unreasoning dislike to Goethe's great English\r\nexpositor, Carlyle. Yet we must not omit, on the other hand, what he\r\nsays of Shelley. Shelley, he admits (much to our surprise), to have\r\nbeen \"one of the best artists of us all; I mean in workmanship of\r\nstyle.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe London _Standard of Freedom_ remarks of the article on \"Some\r\nAmerican Poets\" in the last number of _Blackwood_, that \"it assumes\r\nmore ignorance in England as to American poetry than actually exists.\"\r\nOur readers will readily believe this when advised that the critic\r\nregards _Longfellow_ as a greater poet than Bryant! whom he classes\r\nwith Mrs. Hemans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. COMTE has quitted metaphysics to reform the calendar, but probably\r\nwill not succeed better than those who attempted the same thing during\r\nthe first French revolution. We find a synopsis of his scheme in the\r\n_Leader_. He proposes that each month shall be consecrated to one of\r\nthe great names that represent the intellectual and social progress of\r\nhumanity. He specializes the names of Moses, Homer, Aristotle,\r\nArchimedes, Caesar, St. Paul, Charlemagne, Dante, Descartes, Guttenberg\r\n(whom he probably thinks had something to do with the invention of\r\nprinting), Columbus and Frederic the Great, as most appropriate for\r\nthe designation of the twelve months; recommending, however,\r\nparticular fetes for minor heroes in the months under which they may\r\nbest be grouped--for Augustin, Hildebrand, Bernard, and Bossuet, in\r\nSt. Paul's month; Alfred and St. Louis, in Charlemagne's month;\r\nRichelieu and Cromwell in the month of Frederic the Great, and so on.\r\nSupplying a defect of Catholicism in this respect, he proposes what he\r\ncalls \"fetes of reprobation\" for the greatest scoundrels of\r\nhistory--for such retrogressive men as Julian the Apostate, Philip II.\r\nof Spain, and Bonaparte, (we don't agree to the classification, unless\r\nhe means President Louis Napoleon, who indeed is not a _great_\r\nscoundrel, though disposed to be sufficiently retrogressive.)\r\nAccording to this new calendar, a follower of Comte, writing a letter\r\nin March, would have to date it as written on such or such a day of\r\n_Aristotle_. We fear the proposal won't do even in France, but this,\r\nat least, may be said for it, that it is as good as the Puseyite\r\npractice of dating by saints' days, besides being novel, and Parisian,\r\nand scientific. Sydney Smith used, in jest of the Puseyite practice,\r\nto date his letters \"_Washing Day--Eve of Ironing Day_;\" Comte's plan\r\nis better than that of the Puseyites--almost as good as Peter\r\nPlimley's.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the many books lately printed in England upon the ecclesiastical\r\ncontroversies, is one entitled _Remonstrance against Romish\r\nCorruptions in the Church, addressed to the People and Parliament of\r\nEngland in 1395_, now for the first time published, edited by the Rev.\r\nF. Forshall. Biographers of Wycliffe have referred to this tract and\r\nquoted passages in evidence of the Wycliffite heresies; but they\r\nappear to have failed altogether of perceiving its larger scope, or\r\nunderstanding its political bearing and significance. There can hardly\r\nbe a doubt, as Mr. Forshall suggests, that it was drawn up to\r\ninfluence the famous parliament which met in the eighteenth year of\r\nRichard the Second, and which was a scene of unusual excitement on the\r\nsubject of religion from the sudden clash of the old Papal party with\r\nthe new and increasing band of patriotic reformers. Wycliffe had then\r\nbeen dead, and his opinions gradually on the increase, for more than\r\nten years. The author of the Remonstrance was his friend John Purvey,\r\nwho assisted him in the first English version of the Bible, shared\r\nwith him the duties of his parish, and attended his death-bed. He was\r\nthe most active of the reformers, the most formidable to the\r\necclesiastical authorities. Another old MS. from the Cottonian\r\ncollection in the British Museum, is the _Chronicle of Battel Abbey,\r\nfrom 1066 to 1176, now first translated, with Notes, and an Abstract\r\nof the subsequent History of the Establishment_, by Mark Antony Lower.\r\nThis is extremely curious, and contains, besides the important\r\nhistories of the controversies between the ecclesiastical authorities\r\nand Henry the Second, some very striking exhibitions of manners.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe vitality of SCOTT'S popularity is shown by the fact that the\r\nEdinburgh publishers of his _Life_ and _Works_ printed and sold the\r\nfollowing quantities of them during the period from 1st January, 1848,\r\nto 26th March, 1851, viz.: Novels (exclusive of the Abbotsford\r\nedition), 4,760 sets; Poetical Works, 4,360; Prose Writings, 850;\r\nLife, 2,610; Tales of a Grandfather (independently of those included\r\nin the complete sets of the Prose Works), 2,990; and Selections,\r\n4,420. It may serve as a \"curiosity of literature\" to give a summary\r\nof the printing of the Writings and Life since June, 1829, when they\r\ncame under the management of the late proprietor, Mr. Cadell: Waverley\r\nNovels, 78,270 sets; Poetical Works, 41,340; Prose Works, 8,260; Life,\r\n26,860; Tales of a Grandfather (independently of those included in the\r\ncomplete sets of the Prose Works), 22,190; Selections, 7,550. The\r\npopularity to which the \"People's Edition\" has attained appears from\r\nthe fact that the following numbers, originally published in weekly\r\nsheets, have been printed: Novels, 7,115,197; Poetry, 674,955; Prose,\r\n269,406; Life, 459,291; total sheets, 8,518,849.\r\n\r\nThe whole copyrights, stocks, &c., of Scott's works, as possessed for\r\nmany years by Cadell, have now been transferred to the hands of\r\nMessrs. Adam and Charles Black. The copyrights and stock have been\r\nacquired by the present purchasers for L27,000, or L10,000 less than\r\nMr. Cadell paid for copyrights alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nELIZABETH BARRET BROWNING has published a new poem, _Casa Guidi\r\nWindows_, which gives a vivid picture of the tumult and heroism of\r\nItalian struggles for independence, as seen from the poet's windows,\r\nat Florence, with the fervid commentary of her hopes and aspirations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA novel by MRS.

To bring this project into general notice, and\r\nto form the commencement of the necessary funds, Sir Edward Bulwer\r\nLytton, one of its originators, has written and presented to his\r\nassociates in the cause, a new comedy in five acts, under the\r\nsignificant title, _Not So Bad as we Seem_. It was to be produced on\r\nthe sixteenth ult., under the management of Mr. Charles Dickens, in a\r\ntheatre constructed for the purpose, and performed by Robert Bell,\r\nWilkie Collins, Dudley Costello, Peter Cunningham, Charles Dickens,\r\nAugustus Egg, A.R.A., John Forster, R. H. Horne, Douglass Jerrold,\r\nCharles Knight, Mark Lemon, J. Westland Marston, Frank Stone, and\r\nothers. The tickets were twenty-five dollars each, and the Queen and\r\nPrince Albert were to be present. The comedy is hereafter to be\r\nperformed in public; and the promoters of the scheme are sanguine of\r\nits success. Mr. Maclise has offered to paint a picture (the subject\r\nto be connected with the performance of the comedy), and to place it\r\nat the disposal of the guild, for the augmentation of its funds. The\r\nprospects are encouraging.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe REV. C. G.

Dr. Redford, of Worcester, who confesses, that\r\n\"when a student he would gladly have bartered half the books in his\r\nlibrary to have gained a single perusal of these Lectures; and he\r\ncannot refrain from expressing the belief, that no young student of\r\ntheology will ever regret their purchase or perusal.\" The book makes\r\nan octavo of 1016 pages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"TALVI,\" the wife of Professor ROBINSON, will leave New-York in a few\r\ndays, we understand, to pass some time in her native country.

JOHN E. WARREN, whose pleasant letters from the south of Europe\r\nwere a chief attraction of some of the early numbers of the\r\n_International_, has in the press of Putnam, to be published in a few\r\ndays, _Paria, or Scenes and Adventures on the Banks of the Amazon_. He\r\nsaw that magnificent but little known country under such peculiar\r\nadvantages, and he writes with such spirit and so natural a grace,\r\nthat we may promise the public one of the most delightful books of the\r\nseason in \"Paria.\" Here is a specimen, from the opening chapter.\r\n\r\n     \"The shades of evening were gathering fast upon the waters,\r\n     when the little bark, in which we had safely crossed the\r\n     wide expanse of ocean, now quietly anchored in the mighty\r\n     river of the Amazons. Through the rich twilight we were able\r\n     to discern the white sandy shore, skirting a dense forest of\r\n     perennial luxuriance and beauty. Gentle zephyrs, fraught\r\n     with the most delightful fragrance from the wilderness of\r\n     flowers, softly saluted our senses; while occasionally the\r\n     plaintive voices of southern nightingales came with mellowed\r\n     sweetness to our ears. The moon, unobscured by a single\r\n     cloud, threw an indescribable charm over the enchanting\r\n     scene, reflecting her brilliant rays upon the placid surface\r\n     of the river, and shrouding the beautiful foliage of the\r\n     forest in a drapery of gold. Innumerable stars brightly\r\n     glittered in the firmament, and the constellation of the\r\n     'Southern Cross' gleamed above us like a diadem. All around\r\n     seemed to be wrapped in the most profound repose. Not a\r\n     sound disturbed the silence of the interminable solitude\r\n     save the hushed and mournful notes of evening birds, the\r\n     distant howling of prowling jaguars, or the rustling of the\r\n     wind through the forest trees. Nature appeared to us, for\r\n     the first time, in her pristine loveliness, and seemed\r\n     indeed, to our excited imagination, to present but a dreamy\r\n     picture of fairy land.\r\n\r\n     \"At an early hour in the morning we weighed anchor, and with\r\n     a fresh breeze and strong tide rapidly moved up the noble\r\n     river, gliding by the most beautiful scenery that fancy can\r\n     conceive. The nearly impenetrable forest which lined the\r\n     shore was of a deep emerald green, and consisted of\r\n     exceedingly lofty trees, of remarkably curious and grotesque\r\n     figures, interlaced together by numerous vines, the\r\n     interstices of which were filled up with magnificent\r\n     shrubbery. We observed, towering high above the surrounding\r\n     trees, many singular species of palms, among which the\r\n     far-famed cocoa-nut probably stood pre-eminent. This\r\n     beautiful tree gives a peculiar witchery to a tropical\r\n     landscape, which those only who have seen it can possibly\r\n     realize. The trunk grows up perfectly perpendicular to a\r\n     great height, before it throws out its curious branches,\r\n     which bend over as gracefully as ostrich plumes, and quiver\r\n     in the slightest breeze. Consequently, the general\r\n     appearance of the tree at a distance is somewhat similar to\r\n     that of an umbrella.\r\n\r\n     \"As we gradually proceeded, we now and then caught a glimpse\r\n     of smiling cottages, with the snug little verandahs and\r\n     red-tiled roofs peering from amid the foliage of the river's\r\n     banks, and giving, as it were, a character of sociability\r\n     and animation to the beauteous scene. Perhaps the most\r\n     interesting spot that we noticed was an estate bearing the\r\n     name of Pinherios, which had been formerly the site of a\r\n     Carmelite convent, but which was lately sold to the\r\n     government for a 'Hospital dos Lazaros.' Here also was an\r\n     establishment for the manufacture of earthenware tiles,\r\n     which are extensively used throughout the Brazilian empire\r\n     for roofing houses.\r\n\r\n     \"So low is the valuation of land in this section of Brazil,\r\n     that this immense estate, embracing within its limits nearly\r\n     three thousand acres, and situated, as it is, within twenty\r\n     miles of the city of Para, was sold for a sum equivalent to\r\n     about _four thousand dollars_. This may be taken as a fair\r\n     standard of the value of real estate in the vicinity of\r\n     Para. That of the neighboring islands is comparatively\r\n     trifling; while there are millions of fertile acres now\r\n     wholly unappropriated, which offer the richest inducements\r\n     to emigrants who may be disposed to direct their fortunes\r\n     thither.\r\n\r\n     \"The city of Para is delightfully situated on the southern\r\n     branch of the Amazon, called, for the sake of distinction,\r\n     'The Para River.' It is the principal city of the province\r\n     of the same name,--an immense territory, which has very\r\n     appropriately been styled 'The Paradise of Brazil.' The\r\n     general aspect of the place, with its low venerable looking\r\n     buildings of solid stone, its massive churches and\r\n     moss-grown ruins, its red-tiled roofs and dingy-white walls,\r\n     the beautiful trees of its gardens, and groups of tall\r\n     banana plants peeping up here and there among the houses,\r\n     constituted certainly a scene of novelty, if not of elegance\r\n     and beauty.\r\n\r\n     \"The first spectacle which arrested our attention on landing\r\n     was that of a number of persons of both sexes and all ages\r\n     bathing indiscriminately together in the waters of the\r\n     river, in a state of entire nudity. We observed among them\r\n     several finely-formed Indian girls of exceeding beauty,\r\n     dashing about in the water like a troop of happy mermaids.\r\n     The heat of the sun was so intense that we ourselves were\r\n     almost tempted to seek relief from its overpowering\r\n     influence by plunging precipitately amid the joyous throng\r\n     of swimmers. But we forbore!\r\n\r\n     \"The natives of Para are very cleanly, and indulge in daily\r\n     ablutions; nor do they confine their baths to the dusky\r\n     hours of evening, but may be seen swimming about the public\r\n     wharves at all hours of the day. The government has made\r\n     several feeble efforts to put a restraint upon these public\r\n     exposures, but at the time of our departure all rules and\r\n     regulations on the subject were totally disregarded by the\r\n     natives. The city is laid out with considerable taste and\r\n     regularity, but the streets are very narrow, and miserably\r\n     paved with large and uneven stones. The buildings generally\r\n     are but of one story in height, and are, with few\r\n     exceptions, entirely destitute of glass windows; a kind of\r\n     latticed blind is substituted, which is so constructed that\r\n     it affords the person within an opportunity of seeing\r\n     whatever takes place in the street, without being observed\r\n     in return. This lattice opens towards the street, and thus\r\n     affords great facilities to the beaux and gentlemen of\r\n     gallantry, who, by stepping under this covering, can have an\r\n     agreeable _tete-a-tete_ with their fair mistresses, as\r\n     secretly almost as if they were in a trellised arbor\r\n     together.\r\n\r\n     \"We noticed several strange spectacles as we slowly walked\r\n     through the city. Venders of fruit marching about, with huge\r\n     baskets on their heads, filled with luscious oranges,\r\n     bananas, mangoes, pineapples, and other choice fruits of the\r\n     tropics; groups of blacks, carrying immense burdens in the\r\n     same manner; invalids reclining in their hammocks, or ladies\r\n     riding in their gay-covered palanquins, supported on men's\r\n     shoulders; and water-carriers moving along by the side of\r\n     their heavily-laden horses or mules.\"\r\n\r\nIn his excursions along the small streams which penetrate the forests\r\nour traveller met with some magnificent scenes. Here is a description\r\nof one of them:\r\n\r\n     \"Now the grassy table-land would extend away for miles to\r\n     our left, gemmed here and there with solitary trees, waving\r\n     their branches mournfully in the wind, and looking like\r\n     spectres in the mystic starlight. On the outer side, a\r\n     gloomy yet splendid wilderness ran along the margin of the\r\n     stream, flinging tall shadows across the water, and adding\r\n     grandeur to the imposing landscape. As we advanced the brook\r\n     gradually narrowed, and became more and more crooked in its\r\n     course, until finally the thick clustering foliage met in a\r\n     prolonged arch of verdure over our heads.\r\n\r\n     \"While winding through this natural labyrinth, the sun\r\n     emerged from his oriental couch, and besprinkled us with a\r\n     shower of luminous beams, which, falling through the\r\n     interstices of the leaves, seemed like the spirits of so\r\n     many diamonds. A more divine spectacle of beauty never was\r\n     beheld. The most gorgeous creations of the poet's\r\n     imagination, if realized, could not surpass in magnificence\r\n     this sun-lighted arbor, with its roses and flowers of varied\r\n     hues, all set like stars in a canopy of green. Sprightly\r\n     humming-birds flitted before us, sparkling like jewels for a\r\n     moment, then vanishing away from our sight for ever.\r\n     Butterflies with immense wings, and moths of gay and\r\n     striking colors, flew also from flower to flower, seeming\r\n     like appropriate inhabitants of this little paradise. But\r\n     the indefatigable mosquitoes, who were continually pouncing\r\n     upon our unprotected faces and hands, as well as the mailed\r\n     caymans, who now and then plunged under our canoe with a\r\n     terrific snort, preserved in us the conviction of our own\r\n     mortality.\r\n\r\n     \"As we were moving through a wider passage of the stream, a\r\n     sudden noise in the bushes on our left arrested our\r\n     attention; in a moment after, we perceived a large animal\r\n     running as expeditiously as he was able along the banks of\r\n     the stream. We immediately raised our guns simultaneously\r\n     and fired. Although we evidently gave the creature their\r\n     full contents, yet it produced no other visible effect than\r\n     to cause him to give a boisterous snort, and then dart away\r\n     furiously into the heart of the thicket.\"\r\n\r\nHere is something much more natural than Melville's introduction of\r\nFayaway:\r\n\r\n     \"Among our olive-complexioned neighbors were two young\r\n     girls, whose fine forms and pretty faces especially elicited\r\n     our admiration. The one was named Teresa, the other Florana.\r\n     The former could not have been more than fourteen years of\r\n     age, and was rather short in stature, with exquisitely\r\n     rounded arms, and a bust of noble development; the latter\r\n     was somewhat taller, and at least three years older; they\r\n     both, however, had attained their full size. Animated as\r\n     they were beautiful, they were always overflowing with\r\n     vivacity and life; their conversation, which was incessant,\r\n     was like the chirping of nightingales, and their laughter,\r\n     like strings of musical pearls. These, then, beloved reader,\r\n     were, during our stay at least, decidedly the belles of\r\n     Jungcal. At the close of every day we were visited by all\r\n     the juveniles in the place, who, in their own sweet tongue,\r\n     bade us 'adieus,' and at the same time besought our\r\n     blessing, which latter request we only answered by patting\r\n     them gently on the head. The pretty maidens we have just\r\n     alluded to, instead of shaking hands with us, were\r\n     accustomed to salute us at eventide with a kiss on either\r\n     cheek. The propriety of this we at first doubted, but the\r\n     more we reflected upon the sweetness and innocence of the\r\n     damsels, the more inclined were we to pardon them; and, in\r\n     fact, we finally began to think their manner much more\r\n     sensible and agreeable than that of those who consider any\r\n     thing beyond cold and formal shaking of hands a grievous\r\n     sin. Besides, it must be borne in mind, that this was a\r\n     sacred custom of the place, which it would have been great\r\n     rudeness in us to have resisted. Therefore, kind reader, do\r\n     not judge us too severely; for know, O chary one! that\r\n     extreme bashfulness and modesty have always been considered\r\n     two of our principal failings! One day, Teresa and Florana\r\n     invited us to take a bathe with them in the stream. This we\r\n     declined point-blank. They then charged us with fear of\r\n     alligators. This was a poser--our courage was now called in\r\n     question, and we were literally forced to submit. Pray what\r\n     else could we have done under the circumstances? When they\r\n     had once got us into the water they took ample revenge upon\r\n     us for the uncourteous manner in which we had at first\r\n     treated their request. As we were encumbered by our clothes,\r\n     they had altogether the advantage, and, in less than ten\r\n     minutes, we cried out lustily for quarter, but no quarter\r\n     would they give us, and, to tell the truth, we were somewhat\r\n     apprehensive of being drowned by them, to say nothing of\r\n     being devoured by bloodthirsty alligators. Emerging from the\r\n     water, we walked up to Anzevedo's cottage, revolving in our\r\n     mind the severe ordeal through which we had just passed, and\r\n     determined henceforth never to refuse any request, sweetened\r\n     by the lips of a pretty maiden, unless, perchance (though\r\n     highly improbable), she should ask us for our heart! which,\r\n     alas! we have not to give....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn _Album_ sent to the great Exhibition by the Emperor of Austria, and\r\nto be presented after the show to Victoria, is thus described by a\r\nVienna correspondent of the _Times_: \"It contains the notes in\r\nmanuscript of the national airs and dances, and far surpasses any\r\nthing that I have ever seen in the bookbinding department. On one side\r\nthere are fourteen exquisite vignettes in oil colors, representing\r\ndifferent national costumes; the ornaments in enamel, carved ivory,\r\nand ebony, are exquisite. A second album contains the works of the\r\nancient and modern Austrian composers; the third, Austrian scenery, by\r\ndifferent native artists. The bindings of some of the two hundred and\r\nseventy volumes of Austrian authors will also not fail to excite the\r\nastonishment--I had almost said the envy--of the trade. The whole will\r\nform a truly imperial gift.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fine Arts._\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the present month there are four Public Exhibitions of\r\nPaintings in the city: that of the NATIONAL ACADEMY, of the ART-UNION,\r\nof the ARTIST'S ASSOCIATION, and the DUeSSELDORF GALLERY. The first\r\nthree are composed mainly of the works of native American artists, and\r\nit is impossible to repress an expression of regret that some\r\narrangement of union has not yet been effected, by which, at least,\r\nthe works of the same men should not be exhibited gratis at one place,\r\nand for a charge at another. In the present state of things, the\r\ngallery of the Art-Union and that of the National Academy are brought\r\ninto direct opposition, and this, beyond doubt, without the slightest\r\njealousy on either side, as the works painted for the Academy and\r\npurchased by the Art-Union clearly show. But certainly the fact is\r\nlamentable enough to challenge immediate attention, and to induce a\r\nradical change. A free gallery of the selected works of artists will\r\nbe very apt to carry the day against an exhibition at a quarter of a\r\ndollar of the miscellaneous and unselected works of the same men. But\r\nhere we do not mean to vex this question farther. We aim at a general\r\nreview of the peculiarities and excellences of each exhibition.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly in landscape art that American talent is destined\r\nfirst to excel, and the Academy exhibition and that of the Art-Union\r\nare added proofs of the fact. The landscapes are much the most\r\ndistinguishing and distinguished feature. Mr. DURAND contributes\r\nseveral characteristic works. His style is so uniform and pronounced\r\nthat it is never difficult to recognize his pictures. We should hardly\r\nsay that he does better this year than usual, but we should certainly\r\nnot say that he does worse. In the front rank of this department stand\r\nalso KENSETT and CROPSEY, both of whom show beautiful results of\r\nsummer study and winter work. Mr. Cropsey is mainly distinguished by a\r\nreally gorgeous imagination. Proof of this is to be sought in the\r\nsketches of his portfolio rather than in his finished pictures, for in\r\nthese a thousand influences seduce an artist away from the simplicity\r\nand splendor of his study into a care of public approbation and\r\nsatisfaction. Mr. Cropsey is as yet too much enamored of the details\r\nand even of the mechanism of his art. And this is a tendency that is\r\nfatal to breadth and largeness of impression. Yet his \"Southern\r\nItaly,\" and a \"View in Rockland County,\" in the exhibition, are great\r\nadvances in this respect. On the other hand, the two large American\r\nlandscapes at the Art-Union, while the background in one is a splendid\r\nsuccess, and the brilliant atmosphere of the other is no less\r\nsuccessful, yet they are too much detailed, and the interest is\r\nnowhere sufficiently concentrated. Mr. Kensett is remarkable for his\r\njust sentiment and profound appreciation of natural beauty. It is a\r\nsentiment singularly free from sentimentality, and an appreciation as\r\npoetic as it is profound. The very delicacy of his touch and style\r\nindicate the character of his enjoyment and perception of nature.\r\n\r\nMr. CHURCH, too, is perhaps the other name that we should mention with\r\nthese two as full of hope and promise. If he avoids a little\r\nmannerism, to which he seems to be susceptible--not of course\r\nforgetting that all greatness has its own manner--and pursues with the\r\nsame devotion as hitherto his studies of sea and sky, a very happy and\r\nbrilliant career seems open to him. The works of none of the younger\r\nartists have attracted more attention. And the fame and position of\r\nTurner show the reward of a devoted student and artistic delineator of\r\nthe peculiarities of atmospheric phenomena. We exhort Mr. Church to\r\nentire boldness in his attempts. Why should he hope always to please\r\nthose who have only a vague susceptibility of natural observation for\r\ntheir standard of criticism? He is to show us in the splendid play of\r\nthe light, and air, and clouds, that which we do not see, or seeing,\r\ndo not perceive.\r\n\r\nMessrs. CRANCH, BOUTELLE, GIFFORD, and others, take high rank among\r\nthe landscapists, nor must we omit a very beautiful winter piece of\r\nGIGNOUX, at the Academy, in which the crisp clearness of the sharp\r\nair, the brittle outline of the bare boughs, and the quality of ice,\r\nare most accurately and poetically rendered.\r\n\r\nWe are arrested by the feeling and promise of Mr. RICHARD'S\r\ncontributions, and the very beautiful poetic sentiment of Mr.\r\nHUBBARD'S. Mr. HUNTINGDON is not great, this year. His landscapes are\r\nnot natural, and his portraits lack that vigorous moulding to which we\r\nare accustomed upon his canvas. Mr. RANNEY has some characteristic\r\nhunting-pieces. They are getting too much mannered. On a prairie, the\r\nchief interest of art is not a horse or a buffalo, but the sentiment\r\nof space. But we do not yield to any in our satisfaction at the spirit\r\nand vigor of these works.\r\n\r\nLeaving the landscape, we find the figure compositions of the year not\r\nvery successful, if we except the \"Aztec Princess\" of Mr. HICKS, which\r\nwe understand is a study from life of a Mexican woman, but which is\r\ntreated in so large, and thoughtful, and skilful a manner, that it is\r\nmost impressive for character and color, and gives the key to the\r\nwhole side of the room upon which it hangs. This artist exhibits also\r\nsome portraits, which have never been surpassed by any modern\r\nportraits that we recall. No. 128 upon the Academy Catalogue is the\r\nmost brilliantly-colored portrait upon the walls. It is treated with\r\nall the happy heroism of a master, and while many quarrel with its\r\n_spotty_ color, the initiated perceive that easy mastery of the\r\npalette which with genius is the secret of artistic success. No. 405\r\nis equally remarkable for its vigorous moulding. This portrait shows\r\nthe accurate knowledge, as No. 128 reveals the sumptuous sentiment of\r\nthe genuine artist. Mr. ELLIOTT'S portraits have the same quiet\r\ntruthfulness as heretofore, the same easy success, but we would gladly\r\nsee more confidence in color, and a likeness more as the subject\r\nappears to the mind than to the eye. Mr. SHEGOGUE'S productions are\r\ncertainly very pastoral. So sheepy are his sheep that all the figures,\r\ntrees, and landscape, are unmitigatedly sheepish. Mr. FLAGG'S\r\nportraits are not successful. There is an unnatural smoothness and\r\nhardness in his works. Mr. KELLOGG'S General Scott is vigorous and\r\neffective. The action of the figure seems to require some explanation,\r\nhowever. It contrasts well with the monotony of its pendant, Mr.\r\nVANDERLYN'S General Taylor; but no spectator in regarding this latter\r\nwork has a right to forget that it is the production of one who has\r\ngrown gray at his post, and the winter of whose age has not yet\r\nfrozen, and can never freeze, the freshness of enthusiasm and\r\nsingle-hearted devotion to art which are for ever young.\r\n\r\nMr. LANG'S No. 44 is a very large likeness of a very comely lady, but\r\nthe work will hardly live long in the spectator's memory. Mr. ROSSITER\r\ntakes the field boldly with \"The Ideals, Types of Moral, Intellectual,\r\nand Physical Beauty.\" Except for the brilliance of color, and a\r\ncertain sentiment, by which the light proceeds from the moral type, we\r\ndo not much admire the picture. The difficulty with the spectator will\r\nbe, we are sure, that he recalls within his own circle of friends\r\ntypes more beautiful for each ideal. Mr. Rossiter's portraits of his\r\nbrother artists, Messrs. DARLEY and DUGGAN, are admirable likenesses,\r\neach somewhat mellowed in expression by the artist. The sharp\r\nintellectual precision of Mr. Duggan's countenance, and the bright\r\nnervous sensibility of Mr. Darley's, are both somewhat subdued upon\r\nthe canvas. What we candidly say of these pictures we say boldly,\r\nbecause we recognize and appreciate the fine feeling which animates\r\nthe artist. Mr. GRAY'S No. 54, \"King Death,\" attracts much attention.\r\nBut is it the \"Jolly Old Fellow,\" or the \"King of Terrors,\" or the\r\n\"easeful death\" of which the poet was enamored? There is something\r\nfine in the picture--a strain of Egyptian placidity permeates the\r\nfeatures. And such colossal placidity is full of fate. There is a\r\nlatitude allowed the artist in these themes. Yet we do not feel\r\nsatisfied, much as we like the picture. Mr. ROTHERMEL'S No. 5,\r\n\"Murray's Defence of Toleration,\" is a very pleasant picture of the\r\nDuesseldorf style. We like one thing in this work, and that is its\r\npreservation of the balance of history, by showing that the Catholics\r\nwere not always the persecutors. The contrast of the religious repose\r\nof the rear with the jangling fanaticism of the foreground is in\r\nharmony with the differing qualities of light. It is a thoughtful and\r\nbeautiful picture, Mr. FREEMAN'S 359, \"Study for an Angel's Head,\" has\r\na Titianesque fascination, and the earnest regard of the faces is\r\nextremely lovely. It is none the less charming that it has a mortal\r\nloveliness--if we might say so without treason to the immortality of\r\nall beauty. We have no doubt, in our own critical mind, that any\r\nbeautiful woman would make a beautiful angel. Mr. MOUNT'S No. 118,\r\n\"Who'll turn Grindstone?\" is one of his characteristic Yankee\r\nincidents. It is very true and genuine in feeling, but the picture is\r\ntoo white and streaked. No. 344 is a natural and spirited portrait of\r\nthe poet Stoddard by Mr. PRATT.\r\n\r\nBut we must pause here, leaving many works of which we would willingly\r\nspeak. At the Duesseldorf Gallery, LESSING'S \"Martyrdom of Huss\" is\r\nstill the great attraction. It is a work so full of careful study and\r\nskilful treatment that we are not surprised at the universal pleasure\r\nin its contemplation. We cannot in this space, however, enter into a\r\nconsideration of its artistic claims and character, but must record\r\nour impression that it is not in the highest style of art--if there be\r\nin art a higher style than the adequate representation of the simple\r\nincident. The dexterous detail of the Duesseldorf pictures is\r\nremarkable, but the fault and tendency of the school is to direct\r\nimitation, and consequently to a hopeless struggle with nature. These\r\npictures are the worst possible models for the student of art.\r\n\r\nThe Art-Union Gallery is by no means full, but certainly does not\r\nmerit the harsh criticism of the daily press. The pictures are on an\r\naverage quite as good as usual. The names of most of the distinguished\r\nartists are on the catalogue, and the specimens of their works are\r\ncharacteristic and admirable. There are several poor copies of famous\r\npictures, and these undoubtedly somewhat neutralize the effect of the\r\nnative works. Beside, the Art-Union does not profess to open its\r\ngallery with a complete collection. It buys as the pictures are\r\nproduced, and the criticisms, thus far, have been no less ignorant\r\nthan ill-natured. It does not follow that fifty thousand dollars'\r\nworth of good pictures are annually painted because that sum may be\r\nsubscribed to purchase good pictures. Nor is it at all true, as we\r\nwould undertake to show, had we the space, that artists are\r\nnecessarily the best managers of a popular institution for the advance\r\nof art.\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition of the Artists' Association offers little for remark.\r\nWe are not sufficiently acquainted with the secret of the origin of\r\nthis association to speak of the institution itself, but we observe\r\nmany of the names familiar to us at the Academy and the Art-Union, and\r\ncan truly wish that the pictures were upon the walls of one of those\r\ngalleries.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we remark an unwonted activity and interest in art. It\r\nis impossible not to rejoice at the fact, and at the brilliant proofs\r\nof artistic ability that illuminate the walls of the various\r\ngalleries. The contemporary exhibitions of foreign capitals do not,\r\naltogether, surpass those of their younger sister. American books are\r\nnow not all unread, and those who delight in galleries in which only\r\nTurner, Kaulbach, and Couture are eminently great, could not be unjust\r\nto these promises of American artistic success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLEUTZE, the artist, has been again distinguishing himself by a work\r\njust exhibited in Duesseldorf, \"The Amazon with her Children.\" It\r\nrepresents a beautiful and majestic woman, lying half-erect, arms and\r\nneck bare, contemplating the gambols of her two naked children. The\r\nbrilliant golden-tone of the complexion is said to be entirely worthy\r\nof the masterly skill in color of the artist, and was perhaps inspired\r\nby the poet's dream, \"I will take some savage woman; she shall rear my\r\ndusky race.\" But in respect of composition and drawing it is called an\r\nattempt to imitate the art of the old Italian virtuosos. The artist is\r\nproceeding with surprising rapidity with his Washington. A portrait of\r\nRoting by Leutze is most highly commended. Roting is in the same\r\natelier with Leutze, and is busy upon a scene from the life of\r\nColumbus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Managers of the ART-UNION promise rich returns to the subscribers\r\nfor the present year. We quote the _Art-Union Journal_:\r\n\r\n     \"We have never before offered so many powerful motives to\r\n     membership as the programme of the present year affords. The\r\n     improvements in the Bulletin render it a publication that is\r\n     almost indispensable to those who desire to have in a\r\n     convenient form the most recent Art intelligence, as well as\r\n     much original matter upon the subject that meets the\r\n     constant approbation of instructed readers. The numbers of\r\n     this work are furnished gratuitously to each member from the\r\n     date of his subscription. He will also be entitled to the\r\n     large engraving of _Mexican News_ by JONES, after Woodville,\r\n     and to the second part of the _Gallery of American Art_,\r\n     which contains five line engravings on steel, by the best\r\n     artists, after the following pictures: Cropsey's\r\n     _Harvesting_, Kensett's _Mount Washington_, Woodville's _Old\r\n     '76 and Young '48_, Ranney's _Marion crossing the Pedee_,\r\n     and Mount's _Bargaining for a Horse_. We desire to call\r\n     attention again to the fact that these subjects are all\r\n     American in their character, illustrating the scenery,\r\n     history, or manners of the country. They are also striking\r\n     and valuable as pictures, and we should have every reason to\r\n     feel proud of them in whatever contrast they might be\r\n     placed.\r\n\r\n     \"This project of presenting a work which shall contain in\r\n     process of time the Gems of American Art, is original with\r\n     the Art-Union. Its value must be apparent to every reader.\r\n     It is a mode by which subscribers in the most distant parts\r\n     of the country, who are deprived of the opportunity of\r\n     visiting the large towns, may become well acquainted with\r\n     the character and progress of our principal artists--and\r\n     even those members who have the advantage of resorting to\r\n     public galleries, may enjoy here the privilege of studying\r\n     many pictures that from their location in private\r\n     collections must be accessible to them. The first part of\r\n     this work was given to the members of 1850, and is now ready\r\n     for distribution, Besides the inducements just enumerated,\r\n     there remains a share in the allotment of works of art\r\n     purchased by the Association, and which, judging from the\r\n     two hundred already obtained, will be the most attractive\r\n     collection ever offered by the Art-Union. The importance of\r\n     early subscriptions need not be enlarged upon at present.\r\n     The opportunity it affords of securing complete sets of the\r\n     Bulletin, and better impressions of the engravings, seems to\r\n     be recognized in all quarters. The Association at no period\r\n     of its history has had so long a roll of members at this\r\n     early season.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPAUL DELAROCHE has just completed, at Nice, a grand historical\r\ncomposition, which the most intelligent judges decree to be his _chef\r\nd'oeuvre_. The picture represents a tragical moment in the life of\r\nMarie Antoinette. After a night of anguish before the revolutionary\r\ntribunals the unhappy Queen has just heard the verdict of her guilt.\r\nThe President asks her if she has any thing to say in arrest of the\r\nsentence. For her sole answer, she rises calm and majestic, and takes\r\nsilently the way back again to her dungeon. The artist has seized this\r\ninstant, as she passes erect and still before a crowd of\r\nrevolutionists. A man with a tri-colored scarf walks by her side,\r\nregarding her as a tiger gloats upon a lamb. It is the personification\r\nof terror. A single girl, too young to be cruel, yet attracted with\r\nthe others, perhaps, to applaud the punishment of the _Widow Capet_,\r\nlooks pityingly upon the Queen, her trembling lips murmur a prayer,\r\nand the tears start in her eyes. Upon the lips of the Queen there is\r\nalmost a smile, a thought of disdain, for the outrages of men upon a\r\nsolitary and defenceless woman. From the descriptions of which we\r\nselect the prominent points, it is evident that this is another of the\r\nrepresentations of historical incident for which Paul Delaroche has\r\nmade himself so famous a name, as in his Death of Elizabeth, the\r\nChildren of Edward in the Tower, Cromwell at the Coffin of Charles I,\r\nthe Execution of Strafford, of Lady Jane Grey, Napoleon Crossing the\r\nAlps, &c., &c. And there is no reason that this last work should not\r\nbe, as claimed, the greatest, since the artist adds to the greater\r\ncunning of his hand, the sympathies of chivalrous artistic feeling for\r\nthe sorrow of a beautiful woman and a Queen of France. The picture is\r\nalready sold in London, and will presently be forwarded to its\r\ndestination; on the way it will remain a short time in Paris for the\r\nhomage of the many admirers of this artist's genius.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. MINER K.

From the domination of\r\nnurses, parents, guardians, and teachers, during infancy and youth, to\r\nthe magisterial rule of her lord and master, during married life, and\r\nthe softer control of her children, through that valley of the shadow\r\nof death, old age, it rarely ceases, until the neatly-crimped borders\r\nof the death-cap rest upon the icy brow, and the unfortunate subject\r\nis screwed down in one of those exceedingly awkward mahogany\r\ntenements, henceforth \"all which it may inhabit.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of meeting this destiny of the sex. One is merely\r\nto kiss the rod, and bend before the will of the oppressor, meekly\r\nturning both cheeks to be smitten at once, and offering to lend both\r\ncoat and cloak, even before either is required. The other mode is to\r\nboldly face down the enemy, and by a never-tiring guerilla warfare, to\r\nhamper his movements, cut off his provisions, and finally hem him in,\r\nafter a manner that shall cause him ignominiously to surrender, to lay\r\ndown his arms, pass under the yoke, and at length--converting his\r\nsword into a pruning-hook--leave his conqueror undisputed possession\r\nof the land. The usual injustice of the world is seen in the success\r\nwhich ordinarily attends the latter method; while the meek and gentle,\r\nwho, it is promised, shall inherit the earth, must look for a new\r\nheaven and a new earth before they can come into their property.\r\nHusbands, it is premised, have no small share in this domestic\r\ndespotism. How often do we see--to the shame of the male sex\r\ngenerally, be it spoken--some rough, coarse-minded tyrant, linked to a\r\nquiet, amiable woman, who after a long period of hectoring and\r\ndragooning, ordering and counter-ordering, sinks into the grave of a\r\nbroken heart--or what is worse, a broken spirit. And sometimes--for\r\nfate is sometimes just--the said patient wife is replaced by some\r\nundaunted avenger of her wrongs, who in her turn dragoons, and hectors\r\nOthello, until indeed his \"occupation's gone.\"\r\n\r\nMy old acquaintance, Charles Boldenough, was pronounced to be, by the\r\ntutors, as well as by the students of D---- College, \"the most\r\nunlicked cub\" who ever misconstrued Virgil. Their experience was\r\nundoubtedly great in this species of natural history, but of all the\r\nhard characters who fell under their inspection and jurisdiction, I\r\nquestion if there were one who could with any share of success,\r\ndispute with him the enviable claim of being the hardest. Tall,\r\nathletic, with a huge frame capable of any fatigue, and health that\r\nnever failed him; with a passionate temper, and a stentorian voice\r\nwhose thunders were the terror of the younger boys, Charles Boldenough\r\ncontrived to overawe with brute force all the small fry, and to\r\nconvince the older collegians that it was best to yield passively to\r\npretensions which could only be contended with any chance of success,\r\nby wrestling powers equal to his own. He was in fact the gladiator of\r\nD----College,--champion I should have called him, were it not that he\r\nwas constantly at war with the professors and faculty, who might be\r\nsaid to represent it. The incorrigible laziness and ignorance which\r\nmarked his scholastic career, were fruitful sources of complaint and\r\nreprimand; the frequent boating expeditions, the sporting excursions,\r\nand fishing parties, on which he was absent, sometimes for entire\r\ndays, would unquestionably have terminated the course of his studies,\r\nand released the freshmen from their dreaded tyrant, by his early\r\nexpulsion, had it not been for the influence of powerful family\r\nconnections, and the personal interference of his friends. But in the\r\ncourse of time, he finished his collegiate labors, with all the\r\nhonors, and a scarcity of black eyes, and bloody noses, immediately\r\nprevailed at D----, such as had not occurred for years.\r\n\r\nI separated from him at that time, and heard nothing of him for a long\r\ninterval. When I next saw him, he was married. The person whom my\r\npugnacious acquaintance had made the object of his choice, was a fair\r\nblue-eyed timid little woman, with a frail figure, delicate health,\r\nand temper mild as the summer morning. What could have induced her, to\r\nally herself with this belligerent power, I never could imagine.\r\nWhether she had fallen in love with that great burly countenance, and\r\nloud voice; or whether, as the youngest of ten children, she had\r\nsnatched at the crown matrimonial as affording an escape from a\r\ndisagreeable home, or whether some one of her friends compelled her to\r\ndo it, I have always found it impossible to determine. I only know\r\nthat at the first interview, I saw enough to pity the poor being in my\r\nheart. She hung upon the arm of her Alcides, like a snow-drop on a\r\nrock. My friend had never had many pretensions to beauty; and his\r\nrough red visage and portly figure, bore witness of a right boisterous\r\nand jolly style of living. His first act after his marriage, was to\r\nengage in a violent quarrel with his wife's father and eight stalwart\r\nbrothers, the result of which was a total cessation of intercourse\r\nbetween the two families. His young partner was compelled to receive\r\nthe boon companions of her better half, to the entire exclusion of her\r\nown friends. The home of Charles Boldenough was a constant scene of\r\ndinner parties, and oyster suppers innumerable, which, as they\r\nfrequently ended by an altercation between the host and his guests,\r\nwere a continual source of agitation to his wife.\r\n\r\nA perfect angel of peace and gentleness she was. She bore, with\r\nunexampled resignation, the thraldom which was destroying her health\r\nand comfort. She tried, with patience, every means of pleasing a man\r\nwho never allowed her to know what he liked, as it would have taken\r\naway all room for grumbling. With scrupulous care she attended to his\r\nlittle vexatious wants, his epicurean tastes, his trifling whimsical\r\npeculiarities. If she wished to remain at home, he forced her to go\r\nabroad; if she were desirous of going out, he made her stay within\r\ndoors. If she liked a person more than commonly, he, in the words of\r\nthe vulgar, \"made the house too hot to hold them.\" If, on the\r\ncontrary, she was annoyed by the presence of one of his acquaintances,\r\nshe had time and opportunity to get rid of her abhorrence, since she\r\nwas continually visited with their company. He scolded, grumbled, and\r\nfound fault with every thing she did; with her acts and her intentions\r\nalike. If she ordered a servant to perform any particular duty, he\r\nimmediately countermanded the orders; if she made any change, however\r\nslight, in the family arrangements, no penance could expiate the\r\noffence. So she lived on, with almost a struggle for her existence,\r\nhaving learned the important mythological lesson, that Hymen, like\r\nJanus, wears two faces, and that the temple of the former god, unlike\r\nthat of the latter, is _never_ closed. She had several children (who\r\nfortunately all died before their mother), but Boldenough, on the\r\nground that women were not fit to bring up boys, constantly interfered\r\nin the education of the girls, and made his wife as wretched by this\r\nmeans as by any other. He punished when she rewarded, and indulged\r\nwhen she reproved; he sent them to school when she would have educated\r\nthem at home, and reaped his reward, by having them secretly fear and\r\nhate him. Poor Mrs. Boldenough complained not, but she grew thinner\r\nand paler every year, and her voice, as if lost amid the loud tones,\r\nforever reverberating in her ears, became so low as to be scarcely\r\naudible.\r\n\r\nAt last she died. When it became necessary to inform him of the danger\r\nshe was in, he was at first stupefied by the unexpected intelligence,\r\nand the feeling that he was to lose a household object, which time had\r\nrendered not dear, but familiar. Then he flew into a violent rage,\r\nquarreled with the attendants, servants, even the friends and\r\nrelatives. Having recovered from the shock in some degree, he set\r\nabout persecuting his poor wife during her last moments, in the same\r\nmanner he had done while she enjoyed her health, with this difference:\r\nthat it was now killing with kindness. He sent away in a rage the\r\nfamily physician, although his dying wife begged him, almost with\r\ntears, to retain him. He brought strange attendants to wait upon her,\r\nand insisted upon her eating when she had no appetite, and when the\r\nvery sight of food created disgust. The sight of his big, cross, burly\r\ncountenance, perpetually haunting her, and his loud questions, to\r\nwhich he _would_ have answers, and the eternal remedies, which he\r\ndisturbed her feverish sleep that she might swallow--were causes, as\r\nthe nurse averred, which positively sent the poor lady out of the\r\nworld--\"for he wouldn't,\" said that worthy person, \"he wouldn't have\r\nlet her get well, even if she'd been a mind to.\"\r\n\r\nPoor thing! a man who, as it was universally agreed, had broken his\r\nwife's heart, was not likely to regret her very deeply, or very long.\r\nBut he was rougher and ruder than ever; the confusion into which his\r\nfamily matters immediately fell, the dishonesty of servants, the\r\ndiabolical gastronomy of his _cuisine_, and the insufferable dullness\r\nof a home in which there was no family circle to be made uncomfortable\r\nand to be railed at every hour in the day, induced Charles Boldenough\r\nto mingle more freely in society, in order, as it was immediately\r\nsaid, that he might marry again. Many were the denunciations of wrath\r\nand sorrow to come, which were showered upon the head of that wretched\r\nwoman who should accept Charles Boldenough's huge bony hand. He had\r\nthe name of the worst of husbands, and it was confidently said that he\r\nwould never succeed in contracting a second alliance: an assertion to\r\nwhich he gave the lie by espousing, one year after the death of the\r\nfirst Mrs. Boldenough, an intrepid successor, in the person of a\r\ndamsel whom he had long been known to admire.\r\n\r\nThe second Mrs. Boldenough was a complete and entire contrast to the\r\nfirst. She was so nearly equal to her husband in stature and in size\r\nthat she might almost have succeeded in giving him, what no person had\r\never been known to do, and what he certainly had long required:\r\nnamely, a good flogging. She had a pair of cheeks like nothing in\r\n_this_ world except two prize Spitzenberg apples, black eyes, fierce\r\nand bright and far-seeing almost to a miracle, and a voice that went\r\nthrough your head like a milkman's whistle, whilst the continued sound\r\nof her conversation resembled a gong at the great hotels. Boldenough\r\nshe was by name, and Boldenough by nature; her carriage, erect and\r\nfirm, and rapid as a locomotive, seemed to require the ringing of a\r\nlittle bell before her, to keep the unwary off the tracks, after the\r\nmanner of most railway trains. She was afraid of nothing in the\r\nheavens above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the\r\nearth. She could break the most unruly horse, fire at a mark with a\r\nperfect aim, and collar any man who should show her any impertinence,\r\nwith a coolness and strength of limb perfectly wonderful to behold.\r\nBorn to command, she was not angry but merely surprised that any one\r\nshould dream of controlling her. It was only after a long resistance\r\nto her wishes that the full torrent of her rage burst forth, but with\r\nan overwhelming fury.\r\n\r\nThe French say \"C'est le coeur qui fait le grenadier.\" If this be\r\ntrue, what a very respectable regiment might be formed from the ranks\r\nof the fair sex in all parts of the world, were they but armed and\r\nequipped as the law directs! What an irresistible army would that be\r\nwhich should be formed of troops like these! My friend, Mrs.\r\nBoldenough, would have made an excellent commander to these imaginary\r\nforces, and would, no doubt, have been as entirely successful in\r\noverrunning the enemy's country and driving him from his last\r\nentrenchments, as she was in the domestic circle triumphant over\r\nhusband and servants, and sweeping before her the convivial revellers\r\nof the former by means of the rapid extinction of feudal customs, in\r\nthe shape of suppers and dinner parties.\r\n\r\nMr. Boldenough attempted to make a gallant defence; he stormed, raved,\r\nthreatened, commanded, and exhorted; scenes of conflict, dreadful to\r\nwitness, took place between the warlike hosts. The lord of the\r\nmansion's burly visage turned pale at finding himself stormed down\r\nwith a noise and clatter which almost burst the tympanum of his ears.\r\nIf _he_ had scolded _she_ had raved more loudly, if _he_ had thundered\r\n_she_ rang out her high shrill treble with as much force and strength\r\nas a dinner-bell. Fairly beaten and vanquished, he shrunk from the\r\nground; she, undismayed, \"keeping the natural ruby of her cheeks,\r\nwhile his were pale from fear.\"\r\n\r\nVoe victis! Wo to the conquered! The reign of Mr. Boldenough was\r\nover; a new dynasty took possession of the throne. The old servants\r\nwere packed, bag and baggage, out of the mansion; the old\r\nacquaintances of the host were impressively given to understand that\r\nthey were \"never to come there no more.\"\r\n\r\nThe longer any arbitrary power is established the more secure its\r\nauthority becomes. So it proved with regard to Mrs. Boldenough. There\r\nwas no escaping from her military despotism; she was an excellent\r\nhousewife, and the best of good managers, and as might have been\r\nexpected, she immediately restrained and cut off the lavish\r\nexpenditure of the household. Mr. Boldenough made a few faint expiring\r\nefforts in behalf of his favorite luxuries. Not the better part of\r\nvalor, is, as he discovered, discretion; for his helpmate held in her\r\nhands the buying and the ordering of his dinners and his daily food,\r\nand if he complained he was sure to find his condition worse than it\r\nwas before. In the course of time six sturdy Boldenoughs sprung up,\r\nrobust, hardy, noisy, and passionate as their mother, whose authority\r\nthey served to confirm and strengthen. Then, indeed, it was that my\r\nfriend Charles's shadow perceptibly grew less. He shrank from the\r\nnotice of his wife and the bold Titans, his sons. The first Mrs.\r\nBoldenough's memory was certainly avenged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last time I met my friend he was evidently sinking slowly but\r\nsurely into the vale of years. His great rubicund countenance was\r\nsunken and emaciated, his figure bent and meagre, his voice weak and\r\nfaint as a whisper, and his hearing _entirely gone_. From what cause\r\nmy readers may perhaps imagine. He was, indeed, stone deaf. I\r\nquestion, however, if this were not almost a mercy, considering the\r\ntower of Babel in which he dwelt. Nobody cared what became of him, for\r\nhe had never cared for any body.\r\n\r\nCharles Boldenough departed this life shortly after having survived\r\nhis second marriage fifteen years. The physician had the effrontery to\r\nascribe to paralysis what evidently was no natural death. His end\r\nmight have excited some pity from his acquaintances and friends, if it\r\nhad not been for two things, namely, that he had no friends, and that\r\nhe merely received himself the same treatment which he had given\r\nothers. I was not sorry for him, I confess. Justice is so rare in this\r\nworld of ours, that I am not disposed to undervalue it when it is\r\nsummarily executed. The Amazonian relict of my friend Charles never\r\nre-married. Whether she never found that daring man, who was Van\r\nAmburgh-like enough to put his head in the lioness's mouth without\r\nfear of having it snapped off at one blow, or whether the charge of\r\nher young giants was sufficient for her occupation, or whether she was\r\nconscious of having fulfilled her _mission_, I do not know. She\r\nretained her formidable name to the end of her days.\r\n\r\nReader! I have done. If you are a woman you may smile, and if a man\r\nyou will sneer; but I assure you there is a moral in the _petite\r\nhistoire_ of the second wife. Adieu!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY WITHOUT A NAME[3]\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nBY G. P. R. JAMES, ESQ.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 200._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nThere are seasons in the life of man, as well as in the course of the\r\nyear; and well, unhappily, have many poets painted them in all their\r\nvarious aspects. But these seasons are subject to variations with\r\ndifferent men, as with different years. The summer of one man is all\r\nbright and calm--a lapse of tranquil sunshine, and soft airs, and\r\ngentle dews. With another, the same season passes in the thunder-storm\r\nof passion--the tempests of war or ambition--and often, the gloomy\r\ndays of autumn or of winter overshadowed the rich land, and spoiled\r\nthe promised harvest.\r\n\r\nIt was an autumn-like period during the next three or four months of\r\nthe family of Sir Philip Hastings. For the first time, uncertainty and\r\ndoubt fell upon the family generally. There had been differences of\r\ntemper and of character. There had been slight inconveniences. There\r\nhad been occasional sickness and anxiety. There had been all those\r\nthings which in the usual course of events diminished the sum of human\r\nhappiness even to the most happy. But there had been nothing the\r\nleast like uncertainty of position. There had been no wavering anxiety\r\nfrom day to day as to what the morrow was to bring forth. There had\r\nbeen none of that poison-drop in which the keenest shafts of fate are\r\ndipped, \"the looking for of evil.\"\r\n\r\nNow, every day brought some new intelligence, and some new\r\nexpectation, and the mass was altogether unfavorable. Had the blow\r\nfallen at once--had any one been in power to say, \"Sir Philip\r\nHastings, you must resign all your paternal estates, and pay back at\r\nonce the rents for nearly twenty years--you must give up the rank and\r\nstation which you have hitherto held, and occupy a totally different\r\nposition in society!\" Sir Philip would have submitted at once, and\r\nwith less discomfort than most of my readers can imagine. But it was\r\nthe wearing, irritating, exciting, yet stupefying progress of a\r\nlawsuit which had a painful and distressing effect upon his mind. One\r\nday, he thought he saw the case quite clearly--could track the tricks\r\nof his adversary, and expose the insecure foundation of his claim; and\r\nthen would come two or three days of doubt and discussion, and then\r\ndisappointment, and a new turn where every thing had to begin again.\r\nBut gradually proofs swelled up, first giving some show of justice to\r\nthe pretence that John Ayliffe had some claim, then amounting to a\r\nprobability in his favor, then seeming, to unlearned eyes, very\r\npowerful as to his right.\r\n\r\nI am no lawyer, and therefore cannot pursue all the stages of the\r\nproceeding; but John Ayliffe had for his assistants unscrupulous men,\r\nwhose only aims were to succeed, and to shield themselves from danger\r\nin case of detection; and their turns, and twists, and new points,\r\nwere manifold.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings was tortured. It affected his spirits and his\r\ntemper. He became more gloomy--occasionally irritable, often\r\nsuspicious. He learned to pore over law papers, to seek out flaws and\r\nerrors, to look for any thing that might convey a double meaning, to\r\ntrack the tortuous and narrow paths by which that power which bears\r\nthe name of Justice reaches the clear light of truth, or falls into\r\nthe thorny deep of error.\r\n\r\nAll this disturbed and changed him; and these daily anxieties and\r\ndiscomforts affected his family too--Emily, indeed, but little, except\r\ninasmuch as she was grieved to see her father grieve. But Lady\r\nHastings was not only pained and mortified herself--she contrived to\r\ncommunicate a share of all she felt to others. She became\r\nsad--somewhat sullen--and fancied all the time while she was\r\ndepressing her husband's spirits, and aggravating all he felt by\r\ndespondency and murmurs, instead of cheering and supporting him by\r\nmaking light of the threatened evils, that she was but participating\r\nsympathetically in his anxieties, and feeling a due share of his\r\nsorrows. She had no idea of the duty of cheerfulness in a wife, and\r\nhow often it may prove the very blessing that God intended in giving\r\nman a helpmate.\r\n\r\nSickness, it is true, had diminished somewhat the light spirits of her\r\nyouth, but she had assuredly become a creature of repinings--a\r\nmurmurer by habit--fit to double rather than divide any load of\r\nmisfortune which fate might cast upon a husband's shoulders.\r\n\r\nLady Hastings strove rather to look sad, Emily Hastings to be gay and\r\ncheerful, and both did it perhaps a little too much for the mood and\r\ncircumstances in which Sir Philip then was. He wondered when he came\r\nhome, after an anxious day, that Lady Hastings did nothing to cheer\r\nhim--that every word was gloomy and sad--that she seemed far more\r\naffected at the thought of loss of fortune and station than himself.\r\nHe wondered also that Emily could be so light and playful, so joyous\r\nand seemingly unconcerned, when he was suffering such anxiety.\r\n\r\nPoor Emily! she was forcing spirits in vain, and playing the kindliest\r\nof hypocrites--fashioning every word, and every look, to win him away\r\nfrom painful thought, only to be misunderstood.\r\n\r\nBut the misunderstanding was heightened and pointed by the hand of\r\nmalice. The emotion which Sir Philip had displayed in the court had\r\nnot been forgotten by some whom a spirit of revenge rendered keen and\r\nclear-sighted.\r\n\r\nIt seemed impossible to mingle Emily's name directly with the law\r\nproceedings which were taking place; but more than once in accidental\r\ncorrespondence it was insinuated that secret information, which had\r\nled to the development of John Ayliffe's claim, had been obtained from\r\nsome near relation of Sir Philip Hastings, and it became generally\r\nrumored and credited in the county, that Emily had indiscreetly\r\nbetrayed some secrets of her father's. Of course these rumors did not\r\nreach her ears, but they reached Sir Philip Hastings, and he thought\r\nit strange, and more strange, that Emily had never mentioned to him\r\nher several interviews with John Ayliffe, which he had by this time\r\nlearned were more than one.\r\n\r\nSome strange feelings, disguised doubtless by one of those veils which\r\nvanity or selfishness are ever ready to cast over the naked emotions\r\nof the human heart, withheld him from speaking to his child on the\r\nsubject which caused him so much pain. Doubtless it was pride--for\r\npride of a peculiar kind was at the bottom of many of his actions. He\r\nwould not condescend to inquire, he thought, into that which she did\r\nnot choose to explain herself, and he went on in reality barring the\r\nway against confidence, when, in truth, nothing would have given Emily\r\nmore relief than to open her whole heart to her father.\r\n\r\nWith Marlow, Sir Philip Hastings was more free and communicative than\r\nwith any one else. The young man's clear perceptions, and rapid\r\ncomprehensions on any point in the course of the proceedings going\r\non, his zeal, his anxiety, his thoughtfulness, and his keen sense of\r\nwhat was just and equitable, raised him every day higher in the\r\nopinion of Sir Philip Hastings, and he would consult with him for\r\nhours, talk the whole matter over in all its bearings, and leave him\r\nto solve various questions of conscience in which he found it\r\ndifficult himself to come to a decision. Only on one point Sir Philip\r\nHastings never spoke to him; and that was Emily's conduct with regard\r\nto young Ayliffe. That, the father could not do; and yet, more than\r\nonce, he longed to do it.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, towards the end of six months after the first\r\nprocesses had been issued, Sir Philip Hastings, in one of his morning\r\nconsultations with Marlow, recapitulated succinctly all the proofs\r\nwhich young John Ayliffe had brought forward to establish a valid\r\nmarriage between his mother and the elder brother of the baronet.\r\n\r\n\"The case is very nearly complete,\" said Sir Philip. \"But two or three\r\nlinks in the chain of evidence are wanting, and as soon as I become\r\nmyself convinced that this young man is, beyond all reasonable doubt,\r\nthe legitimate son of my brother John, my course will be soon taken.\r\nIt behooves us in the first instance, Marlow, to consider how this may\r\naffect you. You have sought the hand of a rich man's daughter, and now\r\nI shall be a poor man; for although considerable sums have accumulated\r\nsince my father's death, they will not more than suffice to pay off\r\nthe sums due to this young man if his claim be established, and the\r\nexpenses of this suit must be saved by hard economy. The property of\r\nLady Hastings will still descend to our child, but neither she nor I\r\nhave the power to alienate even a part of it for our daughter's dowry.\r\nIt is right, therefore, Marlow, that you should be set free from all\r\nengagements.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I first asked your daughter's hand, Sir Philip,\" replied Marlow,\r\n\"I heartily wished that our fortunes were more equal. Fate has granted\r\nthat wish, apparently, in making them so; and believe me, I rejoice\r\nrather than regret that it is so, as far as I myself am concerned. We\r\nshall have enough for comfort, Sir Philip, and not too much for\r\nhappiness. What need we more? But I cannot help thinking,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"that this suit may turn out differently from that which\r\nyou expect. I believe that the mind has its instincts, which, though\r\ndangerous to trust to, guide us nevertheless, sometimes, more surely\r\nthan reason. There is an impression on my mind, which all the evidence\r\nhitherto brought forward has been unable to shake, that this claim of\r\nJohn Ayliffe is utterly without foundation--that it is, in fact, a\r\ntrumped up case, supported by proofs which will fall to pieces under\r\nclose examination.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings shook his head. \"But one thing more,\" he said,\r\n\"and I am myself convinced. I will not struggle against conviction,\r\nMarlow; but the moment I feel morally sure that I am defending a bad\r\ncause, that instant I will yield, be the sacrifice what it may.\r\nNothing on earth,\" he continued, in a stern abstracted tone, \"shall\r\never prevent my doing that which I believe right, and which justice\r\nand honor require me to do. Life itself and all that makes life dear\r\nwere but a poor sacrifice in the eyes of an honest man; what then a\r\nfew thousand acres, and an empty designation?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear Sir Philip,\" replied Marlow, \"let us suppose for one\r\nmoment that this claim is a fictitious one, and that it is supported\r\nby fraud and forgery, you will allow that more than a few months are\r\nrequired to investigate all the particulars thoroughly, and to detect\r\nthe knavery which may have been committed?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Marlow,\" replied Sir Philip, \"conviction comes to each mind\r\naccordingly as it is naturally constituted or habitually regulated. I\r\ntrust I have studied the nature of evidence well--well enough to be\r\nsatisfied with much less than mere law will require. In regard to all\r\nquestions which come under the decision of the law, there are, in\r\nfact, two juries who decide upon the merits of the evidence--one,\r\nselected from our fellow men--the other in the bosom of the parties\r\nbefore which each man shall scrupulously try the justice of his own\r\ncause, and if the verdict be against him, should look upon himself but\r\nas an officer to carry the verdict into execution. I will never act\r\nagainst conviction. I will always act with it. My mind will try the\r\ncause itself; and the moment its decision is pronounced, that instant\r\nI will act upon it.\"\r\n\r\nMarlow knew that it was in vain to argue farther, and could only trust\r\nthat something would occur speedily to restore Sir Philip's confidence\r\nin his own rights.\r\n\r\nSir Philip, however, was now absent very frequently from home. The\r\nunpleasant business in which he was engaged, called him continually to\r\nthe county town, and many a long and happy hour might Marlow and Emily\r\nhave passed together had not Lady Hastings at this time assumed a\r\nsomewhat new character--apparently so only--for it was, in fact,\r\nmerely a phase of the old one. She became--as far as health and\r\nindolence would admit--the most prudent and careful mother in the\r\nworld. She insinuated that it was highly improper for Emily to walk or\r\nride alone with her acknowledged lover, and broadly asserted that\r\ntheir previous rambles had been permitted without her knowledge, and\r\nfrom inadvertence. During all Marlow's afternoon visits, she took\r\nespecial care to sit with them the whole time, and thus she sought to\r\ndeprive them of all means of free and unconstrained communication.\r\nSuch would have been the result, too, indeed, had it not been for a\r\nfew morning hours snatched now and then; partly from a habit of\r\nindulgence, and partly from very delicate health, Lady Hastings was\r\nrarely, if ever, down to breakfast, and generally remained in her\r\ndrawing-room till the hour of noon was past.\r\n\r\nThe hours of Sir Philip's absence were generally tedious enough to\r\nhimself. Sometimes a day of weary and laborious business occupied the\r\ntime; but that was a relief rather than otherwise. In general the day\r\nwas spent in a visit to the office of his lawyer, in finding the\r\ninformation he wanted, or the case he had desired to be prepared, not\r\nready for him, in waiting for it hour after hour, in tedious gloomy\r\nmeditation, and very often riding home without it, reflecting on the\r\nevils of a dilatory system which often, by the refusal of _speedy_\r\njustice, renders ultimate justice unavailable for any thing but the\r\nassertion of an abstract principle. He got tired of this mode of\r\nproceeding: he felt that it irritated and disordered him, and after a\r\nwhile, whenever he found that he should be detained in suspense, he\r\nmounted his horse again, and rode away to amuse his mind with other\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe house of Mrs. Hazleton being so near, he more than once paid her a\r\nvisit during such intervals. His coming frequently was not altogether\r\nconvenient to her; for John Ayliffe was not an unfrequent visitor at\r\nher house, and Mrs. Hazleton had to give the young man a hint to let\r\nher see him early in the morning or late in the evening. Nevertheless,\r\nMrs. Hazleton was not at all displeased to cultivate the friendship of\r\nSir Philip Hastings. She had her objects, her purposes, to serve, and\r\nwith her when she put on her most friendly looks towards the baronet\r\nshe was not moved merely by that everyday instinctive hypocrisy which\r\nleads man to cover the passions he is conscious of, with a veil of the\r\nmost opposite appearances, but it was a definite hypocrisy, with\r\nobjects distinctly seen by herself, and full of purpose.\r\n\r\nThus, and for these reasons, she received Sir Philip Hastings on all\r\noccasions with the highest distinction--assumed, with a certain\r\nchameleon quality which some persons have, the color and tone of his\r\nmind to a considerable degree, while yet the general features of her\r\nown character were preserved sufficiently to shield her from the\r\ncharge of affectation. She was easy, graceful, dignified as ever, with\r\na certain languid air, and serious quietness which was very engaging.\r\nShe never referred in her conversations with Sir Philip to the suit\r\nthat was going on against him, and when he spoke of it himself, though\r\nshe assumed considerable interest, and seemed to have a personal\r\nfeeling in the matter, exclaiming, \"If this goes on, nobody's estates\r\nwill be secure soon!\" she soon suffered the subject to drop, and did\r\nnot recur to it again.\r\n\r\nOne day after the conversation between Sir Philip and Marlow, part of\r\nwhich has been already detailed, Sir Philip turned his horse's head\r\ntowards Mrs. Hazleton's at a somewhat earlier hour than usual. It was\r\njust half past ten when he dismounted at the door, but he knew her\r\nmatutinal habits and did not expect to find her occupied. The servant,\r\nhowever, instead of showing him into the small room where she usually\r\nsat, took him to the great drawing-room, and as he went, Sir Philip\r\nheard the voices of Mrs. Hazleton and another person in quick and\r\napparently eager conversation. There was nothing extraordinary in\r\nthis, however, and he turned to the window and gazed out into the\r\npark. He heard the servant go into the morning room, and then\r\nimmediately all sound of voices ceased. Shortly after, a horse's feet,\r\nbeating the ground rapidly, caught the baronet's ear, but the rider\r\nmust have mounted in the courtyard and taken the back way out of the\r\npark; for he came not within Sir Philip's sight. A moment or two\r\nafter, Mrs. Hazleton appeared, and there was an air of eagerness and\r\nexcitement about her which was not at all usual. She seated Sir Philip\r\nbeside her, however, with one of her blandest looks, and then laying\r\nher hand on his, said, in a kind and sisterly tone, \"Do tell me, Sir\r\nPhilip--I am not apt to be curious, or meddle with other people's\r\naffairs; but in this I am deeply interested. A rumor has just reached\r\nme from Hartwell, that you have signified your intention of abandoning\r\nyour defence against this ridiculous claim upon your property. Do tell\r\nme if this is true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Partly, and partly false,\" replied Sir Philip, \"as all rumors are.\r\nWho gave you this information?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, some of the people from Hartwell,\" she replied, \"who came over\r\nupon business.\"\r\n\r\n\"The tidings must have spread fast,\" replied Sir Philip; \"I announced\r\nto my own legal advisers this morning, and told them to announce to\r\nthe opposite party, that if they could satisfy me upon one particular\r\npoint, I would not protract the suit, putting them to loss and\r\ninconvenience and myself also.\"\r\n\r\n\"A noble and generous proceeding, indeed,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, with an\r\nenthusiastic burst of admiration. \"Ah, dear Emily, I can see your\r\nmediation in this.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip started as if a knife had been plunged into him, and with a\r\nprofound internal satisfaction, Mrs. Hazleton saw the emotion she had\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n\"May I ask,\" he said, in a dry cold tone, after he had recovered\r\nhimself a little, \"May I ask what my daughter can have to do with this\r\naffair?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, really--in truth I don't know,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, stammering\r\nand hesitating, \"I only thought--but I dare say it is all nonsense.\r\nWomen are always the peacemakers, you know, Sir Philip, and as Emily\r\nknew both parties well, it seemed natural she should mediate between\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?--\" said Sir Philip Hastings to himself, slowly and\r\nthoughtfully, but he only replied to Mrs. Hazleton, \"No, my dear\r\nMadam, Emily has had nothing to do with this. It has never formed a\r\nsubject of conversation between us, and I trust that she has\r\nsufficient respect for me, and for herself, not to interfere unasked\r\nin my affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe serpent had done its work; the venom was busy in the veins of Sir\r\nPhilip Hastings, corrupting the purest sources of the heart's\r\nfeelings, and Mrs. Hazleton saw it and triumphed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nEmily was as gay as a lark. The light of love and happiness was in her\r\neyes, the hue of health was upon her cheek, and a new spirit of hope\r\nand joy seemed to pervade all her fair form. So Sir Philip Hastings\r\nfound her on the terrace with Marlow when he returned from Hartwell.\r\nShe was dressed in a riding habit, and one word would have explained\r\nall the gaiety of her mood. Lady Hastings, never very consequent in\r\nher actions, had wished for some one of those things which ladies wish\r\nfor, and which ladies only can choose. She had felt too unwell to go\r\nfor it herself; and although she had not a fortnight before expressed\r\nher strong disapprobation of her daughter and Mr. Marlow even walking\r\nout alone in the park, she had now sent them on horseback to procure\r\nwhat she wanted. They had enjoyed one of those glorious rides over the\r\ndowns, which seem to pour into the heart fresh feelings of delight at\r\nevery step, flooding the sense with images of beauty, and making the\r\nblood dance freely in the veins. It seemed also, both to her and\r\nMarlow, that a part of the prohibition was removed, and though they\r\nmight not perhaps be permitted to walk out together, Lady Hastings\r\ncould hardly for the future forbid them to ride. Thus they had come\r\nback very well pleased, with light hearts within, and gay hopes\r\nfluttering round them.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings, on the other hand, had passed a day of\r\nbitterness, and hard, painful thought. On his first visit to the\r\ncounty town, he had, as I have shown, been obliged once more to put\r\noff decision. Then came his conference with Mrs. Hazleton. Then he had\r\nreturned to his lawyer's office, and found that the wanting evidence\r\nhad been supplied by his opponents. All that he had demanded was\r\nthere; and no apparent flaw in the case of his adversary. He had\r\nalways announced his attention of withdrawing opposition if such\r\nproofs were afforded, and he did so now, with stern, rigid, and\r\nsomewhat hasty determination--but not without bitterness and regret.\r\nHis ride home, too, was troubled with dull and grievous thoughts, and\r\nhis whole mind was out of tune, and unfit to harmonize with gaiety of\r\nany kind. He forgot that poor Emily could not see what had been\r\npassing in his bosom, could not know all that had occurred to disturb\r\nand annoy him, and her light and cheerful spirits seemed an offence to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSir Philip passed on, after he had spoken a few words to Marlow, and\r\nsought Lady Hastings in the room below, where she usually sat after\r\nshe came down. Sir Philip, as I have shown, had not been nurtured in a\r\ntender school, and he was not very apt by gentle preparation to soothe\r\nthe communication of any bad tidings. Without any circumlocution,\r\nthen, or prefatory remarks of any kind, he addressed his wife in the\r\nfollowing words: \"This matter is decided, my dear Rachel. I am no\r\nlonger Sir Philip Hastings, and it is necessary that we should remove\r\nfrom this house within a month, to your old home--the Court. It will\r\nbe necessary, moreover, that we should look with some degree of\r\naccuracy into the state of our future income, and our expenditure.\r\nWith your property, and the estate which I inherit from my mother,\r\nwhich being settled on the younger children, no one can take from me,\r\nwe shall still have more than enough for happiness, but the style of\r\nour living must be altered. We shall have plenty of time to think of\r\nthat, however, and to do what we have to do methodically.\"\r\n\r\nLady Hastings, or as we should rather call her now, Mistress Hastings,\r\nseemed at first hardly to comprehend her husband's meaning, and she\r\nreplied, \"You do not mean to say, Philip, that this horrible cause is\r\ndecided?\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as I am concerned, entirely,\" replied Sir Philip Hastings. \"I\r\nshall offer no farther defence.\"\r\n\r\nLady Hastings fell into a fit of hysterics, and her husband knowing\r\nthat it was useless to argue with her in such circumstances, called\r\nher maid, and left her.\r\n\r\nThere was but a dull dinner-party at the Hall that day. Sir Philip was\r\ngloomy and reserved, and the news which had spread over the house, as\r\nto the great loss of property which he had sustained, soon robbed his\r\ndaughter of her cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nMarlow, too, was very grave; for he thought his friend had acted, not\r\nonly hastily, but imprudently. Lady Hastings did not come down to\r\ndinner, and as soon as the meal was over Emily retired to her mother's\r\ndressing-room, leaving Marlow and her father with their wine. Sir\r\nPhilip avoided the subject of his late loss, however, and when Marlow\r\nhimself, alluded to it, replied very briefly.\r\n\r\n\"It is done,\" he said, \"and I will cast the matter entirely from my\r\nmind, Marlow. I will endeavor, as far as possible, to do in all\r\ncircumstances what is right, whatever be the anguish it costs me.\r\nHaving done what is right, my next effort shall be to crush every\r\nthing like regret or repining. There is only one thing in life which\r\ncould give me any permanent pain, and that would be to have an\r\nunworthy child.\"\r\n\r\nMarlow did not seem to remark the peculiar tone in which the last\r\nwords were uttered, and he replied. \"There, at least, you are most\r\nhappy, Sir Philip; for surely Emily is a blessing which may well\r\ncompensate for any misfortunes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust so--I think so,\" said Sir Philip, in a dry and hasty manner,\r\nand then changing the subject, he added, \"Call me merely Philip\r\nHastings, my good friend. I say with Lord Verulam, 'The Chancellor is\r\ngone.' I mean I am no longer a baronet. That will not distress me,\r\nhowever, and as to the loss of fortune, I can bear it with the most\r\nperfect indifference.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings reckoned in some degree without his host, however. He\r\nknew not all the petty annoyances that were in store for him. The\r\ncosts he had to pay, the back-rents which were claimed, the long and\r\ncomplicated accounts that were to be passed, the eager struggle which\r\nwas made to deprive him of many things undoubtedly his own; all were\r\nmatters of almost daily trouble and irritation during the next six\r\nmonths. He had greatly miscalculated the whole amount of expenses.\r\nHaving lived always considerably within his income, he had imagined\r\nthat he had quite a sufficient amount in ready money to pay all the\r\ndemands that could be made upon him. But such was far from being the\r\ncase. Before all the debts were paid, and the accounts closed, he was\r\nobliged to raise money upon his life-interest in his mother's\r\nproperty, and to remain dependent, as it were, upon his wife's income\r\nfor his whole means. These daily annoyances had a much greater effect\r\nupon Mr. Hastings than any great and serious misfortune could have\r\nhad. He became morose, impatient, gloomy. His mind brooded over all\r\nthat had occurred, and all that was occurring. He took perverted views\r\nof many things, and adhered to them with an obstinacy that nothing\r\ncould shake.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time all the neighbors and friends of the family\r\nendeavored to show their sympathy and kindness by every means in their\r\npower. Even before the family quitted the Hall, the visitors were more\r\nnumerous than they had ever been before, and this was some consolation\r\nto Mistress Hastings, though quite the contrary to her husband, who\r\ndid not indeed appear very frequently amongst the guests, but remained\r\nin his own study as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIt was a very painful day for every one, and for Emily especially,\r\nwhen they passed the door of the old Hall for the last time, and took\r\ntheir way through the park towards the Court. The furniture in great\r\npart, the books, the plate, had gone before; the rooms looked vacant\r\nand desolate, and as Emily passed through them one by one, ere she\r\nwent down to the carriage, there was certainly nothing very attractive\r\nin their aspect. But there were spots there associated with many dear\r\nmemories--feelings--fancies--thoughts--all the bright things of early,\r\nhappy youth; and it was very bitter for her to leave them all, and\r\nknow that she was never to visit them again.\r\n\r\nShe might, and probably would, have fallen into one of her deep\r\nreveries, but she struggled against it, knowing that both her father\r\nand her mother would require comfort and consolation in the coming\r\nhours. She exerted herself, then, steadily and courageously to bear up\r\nwithout a show of grief, and she succeeded even too well to satisfy\r\nher father. He thought her somewhat light and frivolous, and judged it\r\nvery strange that his daughter could quit her birth-place, and her\r\nearly home, without, apparently, one regretful sigh. He himself sat\r\nstern, and gloomy, and silent, in the carriage, as it rolled away.\r\nMistress Hastings leaned back, with her handkerchief over her eyes,\r\nweeping bitterly. Emily alone was calmly cheerful, and she maintained\r\nthis demeanor all the way along till they reached the Court, and\r\nseparated till dinner-time. Then, however, she wept bitterly and long.\r\n\r\nBefore she had descended to meet her parents at dinner, she did her\r\nbest to efface all traces of her sad employment for the last hour. She\r\ndid not succeed completely, and when she entered the drawing-room, and\r\nspoke cheerfully to her father, he raised his eyes to her face, and\r\ndetected, at once, the marks of recent tears on her swollen eyelids.\r\n\r\n\"She has been weeping,\" said Mr. Hastings to himself; \"can I have been\r\nmistaken?\"\r\n\r\nA gleam of the truth shot through his mind, and comforted him much,\r\nbut alas, it was soon to be lost again.\r\n\r\nFrom feelings of delicacy, Marlow had absented himself that day, but\r\non the following morning he was there early, and thenceforward was a\r\ndaily visitor at the Court. He applied himself particularly to cheer\r\nEmily's father, and often spent many hours with him, withdrawing Mr.\r\nHastings' mind from all that was painful in his own situation, by\r\nleading it into those discussions of abstract propositions of which he\r\nwas so fond. But Marlow was not the only frequent visitor at the\r\nCourt. Mrs. Hazleton was there two or three times in the week, and was\r\nall kindness, gentleness, and sympathy. She had tutored herself well,\r\nand she met Mr. Marlow as Emily's affianced husband, with an ease and\r\nindifference which was marvellously well assumed. To Mrs. Hastings she\r\nproved the greatest comfort, although it is not to be asserted that\r\nthe counsels which she gave her, proved at all comfortable to the rest\r\nof the household, and yet Mrs. Hazleton never committed herself. Mrs.\r\nHastings could not have repeated one word that she said, that any one\r\non earth could have found fault with. She had a mode of insinuating\r\nadvice without speaking it--of eking out her words by looks and\r\ngestures full of significance to the person who beheld them, but\r\nperfectly indescribable to others.\r\n\r\nShe was not satisfied, however, with being merely the friend and\r\nconfidante of Mrs. Hastings. She must win Emily's father also, and she\r\nsucceeded so well that Mr. Hastings quite forgot all doubts and\r\nsuspicions, and causes of offence, and learned to look upon Mrs.\r\nHazleton as a really kind and amiable person, and as consistent as\r\ncould be expected of any woman.\r\n\r\nNot one word, however, did Mrs. Hazleton say in the hearing of Emily's\r\nfather which could tend in any degree to depreciate the character of\r\nMr. Marlow, or be construed into a disapproval of the proposed\r\nmarriage. She was a great deal too wise for that, knowing the\r\ncharacter of Mr. Hastings sufficiently to see that she could effect no\r\nobject, and only injure herself by such a course.\r\n\r\nTo Emily she was all that was kind and delightful. She was completely\r\nthe Mrs. Hazleton of former days; but with the young girl she was less\r\nsuccessful than with her parents. Emily could never forget the visit\r\nto her house, and what had there occurred, and the feelings which she\r\nentertained towards Mrs. Hazleton were always those of doubt. Her\r\ncharacter was a riddle to Emily, as well it might be. There was\r\nnothing upon which she could definitely fix as an indication, of a bad\r\nheart, or of duplicity of nature, and yet she doubted; nor did Marlow\r\nat all assist in clearing her mind; for although they often spoke of\r\nMrs. Hazleton, and Marlow admitted all her bright and shining\r\nqualities, yet he became very taciturn when Emily entered more deeply\r\ninto that lady's character. Marlow likewise had his doubts, and to say\r\nsooth, he was not at all well pleased to see Mrs. Hazleton so\r\nfrequently with Mrs. Hastings. He did not well know what it was he\r\nfeared, but yet there was a something which instinctively told him\r\nthat his interests in Emily's family would not find the most favorable\r\nadvocate in Mrs. Hazleton.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things when one evening there was assembled at\r\nthe house of Mr. Hastings, a small dinner party--the first which had\r\nbeen given since his loss of property. The summer had returned, the\r\nweather was beautiful, the guests were cheerful and intellectual, and\r\nthe dinner passed off happily enough. There were several gentlemen and\r\nseveral ladies present, and amongst the latter was Mrs. Hazleton.\r\nPolitics at that time ran high: the people were not satisfied\r\naltogether with the King whom they had themselves chosen, and several\r\nacts of intolerance had proved that promises made before the\r\nattainment of power are not always very strictly maintained when power\r\nhas been reached. Mr. Hastings had never meddled in the strife of\r\nparty. He had a thorough contempt for policy and politicians, but he\r\ndid not at all object to argue upon the general principles of\r\ngovernment, in an abstract manner, and very frequently startled his\r\nhearers by opinions, not only unconstitutional, and wide and far from\r\nany of the received notions of the day, but sometimes also, very\r\nviolent, and sometimes at first sight, irreconcilable with each other.\r\nOn the present occasion the conversation after dinner took a political\r\nturn, and straying away from their wine, the gentlemen walked out into\r\nthe gardens, which were still beautifully kept up, and prolonged their\r\ndiscussion in the open air. The ladies too--as all pictures show they\r\nwere fond of doing in those days--were walking amongst the flowers,\r\nnot in groups, but scattered here and there. Marlow was naturally\r\nmaking his way to the side of Emily, who was tying up a shrub at no\r\ngreat distance from the door, but Mrs. Hazleton unkindly called him to\r\nher, to tell her the name of a flower which she did not know. In the\r\nmean time Mr. Hastings took his daughter by the arm, leaning gently\r\nupon her, and walking up and down the terrace, while he continued his\r\ndiscussion with a Northumberland gentleman known in history as Sir\r\nJohn Fenwick. \"The case seems to be this,\" said Mr. Hastings, in reply\r\nto some question or the other; \"all must depend upon the necessity.\r\nViolent means are bad as a remedy for any thing but violent evils, but\r\nthe greatness of the evil will often justify any degree of vigor in\r\nthe means. Will any one tell me that Brutus was not justified in\r\nstabbing Caesar? Will any one tell me that William Tell was not\r\njustified in all that he did against the tyrant of his country? I will\r\nnot pretend to justify the English regicides, not only because they\r\ncondemned a man by a process unknown to our laws, and repugnant to all\r\njustice, but because they committed an act for which there was no\r\nabsolute necessity. Where an absolute necessity is shown,\r\nindeed--where no other means can be found of obtaining freedom,\r\njustice and security, I see no reason why a King should not be put to\r\ndeath as well as any other man. Nay more, he who does the deed with a\r\nfull appreciation of its importance, a conscience clear of any private\r\nmotives, and a reasoning sense of all the bearings of the act he\r\ncommits, merits a monument rather than a gibbet, though in these days\r\nhe is sure to obtain the one and not the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush, do not speak so loud, my dear sir,\" said Sir John\r\nFenwick; \"less than those words brought Sidney's head to the block.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid of mine,\" replied Mr. Hastings, with a faint smile;\r\n\"mine are mere abstract notions with regard to such things; very\r\nlittle dangerous to any crowned heads, and if they thought fit to put\r\ndown such opinions, they would have to burn more than one half of all\r\nthe books we have derived from Rome.\"\r\n\r\nSir John Fenwick would not pursue the subject, however, and turned the\r\nconversation in another course. He thought indeed that it had gone far\r\nenough, especially when a young lady was present; for he was one of\r\nthose men who have no confidence in any woman's discretion, and he\r\nknew well, though he did not profit much by his knowledge, that things\r\nvery slight, when taken abstractedly, may become very dangerous if\r\nforced into connection with events. Philip Hastings would have said\r\nwhat he did say, before any ears in Europe, without the slightest\r\nfear, but as it proved, he had said too much for his own safety. No\r\none indeed seemed to have noticed the very strong opinions he had\r\nexpressed except Sir John Fenwick himself, and shortly after the party\r\ngathered together again, and the conversation became general and not\r\nvery interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nMen have lived and died in the pursuit of two objects the least\r\nworthy, on which the high mind of man could ever fix, out of all the\r\nvain illusions that lead us forward through existence from youth to\r\nold age: the philosopher's stone, and the elixir of life. Gold, gold,\r\nsordid gold--not competence--not independence, but wealth--profuse,\r\ninexhaustible wealth--the hard food of Croesus; strange that it\r\nshould ever form the one great object of an immortal spirit! But\r\nstranger still, that a being born to higher destinies should seek to\r\npin itself down to this dull earth forever--to dwell in a clay hut,\r\nwhen a palace gates are open--to linger in a prison, when freedom may\r\nbe had--to outlive affections, friendships, hope and happiness--to\r\nremain desolate in a garden where every flower has withered. To seek\r\nthe philosopher's stone--even could it have been found--was a madness:\r\nbut to desire the elixir of life was a worse insanity.\r\n\r\nThere was once, however, in the world's history a search--an eager\r\nsearch, for that which at first sight may seem nearly the same as the\r\ngreat elixir; but which was in reality very, very different.\r\n\r\nWe are told by the historians of America, that a tradition prevailed\r\namongst the Indians of Puerto Rico, that in one of the islands on the\r\ncoast, there was a fountain which possessed the marvellous power of\r\nrestoring, to any one who bathed in its waters, all the vigor and\r\nfreshness of youth, and that some of the Spanish adventurers sought it\r\nanxiously, but sought in vain. Here indeed was an object worthy of\r\ndesire--here, what the heart might well yearn for, and mourn to find\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nOh, that fountain of youth, what might it not give back! The easy\r\npliancy of limb: the light activity of body: the calm, sweet sleep;\r\nthe power of enjoyment and acquisition: the freshness of the heart:\r\nthe brightness of the fancy: the brilliant dreams: the glorious\r\naspirations: the beauty and the gentleness: the innocence: the love.\r\nWe, who stand upon the shoal of memory, and look back in our faint\r\ndreams, to the brighter land left far behind, may well long for that\r\nsweet fountain which could renew--not life--but youth.\r\n\r\nOh youth--youth! Give me but one year of youth again. And it shall\r\ncome. I see it there, beyond the skies, that fountain of youth, in the\r\nland where all flowers are immortal.\r\n\r\nIt is very strange, however, that with some men, when youth is gone,\r\nits very memories die also. They can so little recollect the feelings\r\nof that brighter time, that they cannot comprehend them in others:\r\nthat they become a mystery--a tale written in a tongue they have\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nIt was so with Philip Hastings, and so also with his wife. Neither\r\nseemed to comprehend the feelings of Marlow and Emily; but her father\r\nunderstood them least. He had consented to their union: he approved of\r\nher choice; but yet it seemed strange and unpleasant to him, that her\r\nthoughts should be so completely given to her lover. He could hardly\r\nbelieve that the intense affection she felt for another, was\r\ncompatible with love towards her parent. He knew not, or seemed to\r\nhave forgotten that the ordinance to leave all and cleave unto her\r\nhusband, is written in woman's heart as plainly as in the Book.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, that which he felt was not the least like\r\njealousy--although I have seen such a thing even in a parent towards a\r\nchild. It was a part of the problem of Emily's character, which he was\r\nalways trying to solve without success.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" he thought, \"she has known this young man, but a short\r\ntime--no years--not very many months; and yet, it is clear, that in\r\nthat short space, she has learned to love him better than those to\r\nwhom she is bound by every tie of long enduring affection and\r\ntenderness.\"\r\n\r\nHad he thought of comparing at all, her conduct and feelings with\r\nthose of his own youth, he would still have marvelled; for he would\r\nhave said, \"I had no tenderness shown me in my young days--I was not\r\nthe companion, the friend, the idol, the peculiar loved one of father\r\nor mother, so long as my elder brother lived. I loved her who first\r\nreally loved me. From _my_ parents, I had met small affection, and but\r\nlittle kindness. It was therefore natural that I should fix my love\r\nelsewhere, as they had fixed theirs. But with my child, the case is\r\nvery different.\"\r\n\r\nYet he loved Marlow well--was fond of his society--was well pleased\r\nthat he was to be his daughter's husband; but even in his case, Mr.\r\nHastings was surprised in a certain degree; for Marlow did not, and\r\ncould not conceal that he loved Emily's society better than her\r\nfather's--that he would rather a great deal be with her than with\r\nBrutus himself or Cato.\r\n\r\nThis desire on the part of Marlow to be ever by her side, was a great\r\nstumbling-block in the way of Mr. Hastings' schemes for re-educating\r\nMarlow, and giving that strength and vigor to his character of which\r\nhis future father-in-law had thought it susceptible. He made very\r\nlittle progress, and perhaps Marlow's society might even have had some\r\ninfluence upon him--might have softened--mitigated his character; but\r\nthat there were counteracting influences continually at work.\r\n\r\nAll that had lately happened--the loss of fortune and of station--the\r\ndark and irritating suspicions which had been instilled into his mind\r\nin regard to his child's conduct--the doubts which had been produced\r\nof her frankness and candor--the fact before his eyes, that she loved\r\nanother better, far better, than himself, with a kind word, now and\r\nthen, from Mrs. Hazleton, spoken to drive the dart deeper into his\r\nheart, had rendered him somewhat morose and gloomy,--apt to take a bad\r\nview of other people's actions, and to judge less fairly than he\r\nalways wished to judge. When Marlow hastened away from him to rejoin\r\nEmily, and paint, with her, in all the brightest colors of\r\nimagination, a picture of the glowing future, her father would walk\r\nsolitary and thoughtful, giving himself up to dark and unprofitable\r\nreveries.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hastings in the mean time would take counsel with Mrs. Hazleton,\r\nand they would settle between them that the father was already\r\ndissatisfied with the engagement he had aided to bring about, and that\r\na little persevering opposition on the part of the mother, would\r\nultimately bring that engagement to an end.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hastings, too, thought--or rather seemed to feel, for she did not\r\nreduce it to thought--that she had now a greater right to exercise\r\nsome authority in regard to her daughter's marriage, as Emily's whole\r\nfortune must proceed from her own property. She ventured to oppose\r\nmore boldly, and to express her opinion against the marriage, both to\r\nher husband and her child. It was against the advice of Mrs. Hazleton\r\nthat she did so; for that lady knew Mr. Hastings far better than his\r\nown wife knew him; and while Emily's cheek burned, and her eye swam in\r\ntears, Mr. Hastings replied in so stern and bitter a tone that Mrs.\r\nHastings shrunk back alarmed at what she herself had done.\r\n\r\nBut the word had been spoken: the truth revealed. Both Mr. Hastings\r\nand Emily were thenceforth aware that she wished the engagement\r\nbetween her daughter and Marlow broken off--she was opposed to the\r\nmarriage; and would oppose it.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this revelation of her views upon her child and her\r\nhusband, was very different. Emily had colored with surprise and\r\ngrief--not, as her father thought, with anger; and she resolved\r\nthenceforth to endeavor to soften her mother's feelings towards him\r\nshe loved, and to win her consent to that upon which all her own\r\nhappiness depended; but in which her own happiness could not be\r\ncomplete without a mother's approbation.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, on the contrary, entertained no expectation that his\r\nwife would ever change her views, even if she changed her course. Some\r\nknowledge--some comprehension of her character had been forced upon\r\nhim during the many years of their union; and he believed that, if all\r\nopen remonstrance, and declared opposition had been crushed by his\r\nsharp and resolute answer, there would nevertheless be continual or\r\never recurring efforts on Mrs. Hastings' part, to have her own way,\r\nand thwart both his purposes and Emily's affection. He prepared to\r\nencounter that sort of irritating guerrilla warfare of last words, and\r\nsneers, and innuendoes, by which a wife sometimes endeavors to\r\novercome a husband's resolutions; and he hardened himself to resist.\r\nHe knew that she could not conquer in the strife; but he determined to\r\nput an end to the warfare, either by some decided expression of his\r\nanger at such proceedings, or by uniting Emily to Marlow, much sooner\r\nthan he had at first proposed.\r\n\r\nThe latter seemed the easiest method, and there was a great chance of\r\nthe marriage, which it had been agreed should be delayed till Emily\r\nwas nineteen, taking place much earlier, when events occurred which\r\nproduced even a longer delay.\r\n\r\nOne of the first steps taken by Mr. Hastings to show his wife that her\r\nunreasonable opposition would have no effect upon him, was not only to\r\nremove the prohibition of those lovers' rambles which Mrs. Hastings\r\nhad forbidden, but to send his daughter and her promised husband forth\r\ntogether on any pretext that presented itself. He took the opportunity\r\nof doing so, first, when his wife was present, and on the impulse of\r\nthe moment, she ventured to object. One look--one word from her\r\nhusband, however, silenced her; for they were a look and word too\r\nstern to be trifled with, and Emily went to dress for her walk; but\r\nshe went with the tears in her eyes. She was grieved to find that all\r\nthat appertained to her happiness was likely to become a cause of\r\ndissension between her father and her mother. Had Marlow not been\r\nconcerned--had his happiness not been also at stake--she would have\r\nsacrificed any thing--every thing--to avoid such a result; but she\r\nfelt she had no right to yield to caprice, where he was to suffer as\r\nwell as herself.\r\n\r\nThe walk took place, and it might have been very sweet to both, had\r\nnot the scene which had immediately preceded poured a drop of\r\nbitterness into their little cup of joy. Such walks were often renewed\r\nduring the month that followed; but Emily was not so happy as she\r\nmight have been; for she saw that her father assumed a sterner, colder\r\ntone towards his wife, and believed that she might be the unwilling\r\ncause of this painful alienation. She knew not that it proceeded\r\npartly from another source--that Mr. Hastings had discovered, or\r\ndivined, that his wife had some feeling of increased power and\r\nauthority from the fact of his having lost his large estates, and of\r\nher property being all that remained to them both.\r\n\r\nPoor Emily! Marlow's love, that dream of joy, seemed destined to\r\nproduce, for a time at least, nothing but grief and anxiety. Her\r\nreveries became more frequent, and more deep, and though her lover\r\ncould call her from them in a moment, no one else had the power.\r\n\r\nOne day, Marlow and his Emily--for whom every day his love increased;\r\nfor he knew and comprehended her perfectly, and he was the only\r\none--had enjoyed a more happy and peaceful ramble than usual, through\r\ngreen lanes, and up the hill, and amidst the bright scenery which lay\r\non the confines of the two counties, and they returned slowly towards\r\nthe house, not anticipating much comfort there. As they approached,\r\nthey saw from the road a carriage standing before the door, dusty, as\r\nif from a long journey, but with the horses still attached. There were\r\nthree men, too, with the carriage, besides the driver, and they were\r\nwalking their horses up and down the terrace, as if their stay was to\r\nbe but short. It was an unusual number of attendants, even in those\r\ndays, to accompany a carriage in the country, except upon some visit\r\nof great ceremony; and the vehicle itself--a large, old, rumbling\r\ncoach, which had seen better days--gave no indication of any great\r\nstate or dignity on the part of its owner.\r\n\r\nWhy, she knew not, but a feeling of fear, or at least anxiety, came\r\nover Emily as she gazed, and turning to Marlow, she said, \"Who can\r\nthese visitors be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not, indeed, dear love,\" he answered, \"but the equipage is\r\nsomewhat strange. Were we in France,\" he added, with a laugh, \"I\r\nshould think it belonged to an exempt, bearing a _lettre de cachet_.\"\r\n\r\nEmily smiled also, for the idea of her father having incurred the\r\nanger of any government or violated any law seemed to her quite out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nWhen they approached the door, however, they were met by a servant,\r\nwith a grave and anxious countenance, who told her that her father\r\nwished to see her immediately in the dining hull.\r\n\r\n\"Is there any one with him?\" asked Emily, in some surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mistress Emily,\" replied the man, \"there is a strange gentleman\r\nwith him. But you had better go in at once; for I am afraid things are\r\nnot going well.\"\r\n\r\nMarlow drew her arm through his, and pressed it gently to make her\r\nfeel support; and then went into the eating-room, as it was usually\r\ncalled, by her side.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered they found the scene a strange and painful one. Mr.\r\nHastings was seated near a window, with his hat on, and his cloak cast\r\ndown on a chair beside him. His wife was placed near him, weeping\r\nbitterly; and at the large table in the middle of the room was a\r\ncoarse-looking man, in the garb of a gentleman, but with no other\r\nindication but that of dress of belonging to a superior class. He was\r\nvery corpulent, and his face, though shadowed by an enormous wig, was\r\nlarge and bloated. There was food and wine before him, and to both he\r\nseemed to be doing ample justice, without taking any notice of the\r\nmaster of the house or his weeping lady.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings, however, rose and advanced towards his daughter, as soon\r\nas she entered, and in an instant the eye of the gormandizing guest\r\nwas raised from his plate and turned towards the party, with a look of\r\neager suspicion.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear father, what is this?\" exclaimed Emily, running towards\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"One of those accidents of life, my child,\" replied Mr. Hastings,\r\n\"from which I had hoped to be exempt--most foolishly. But it seems,\"\r\nhe continued, \"no conduct, however reserved, can shield one from the\r\nunjust suspicions of princes and governments.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good cause for suspicion, sir,\" said the man at the table,\r\nquaffing a large glass of wine. \"Mr. Secretary would not have signed a\r\nwarrant without strong evidence. Vernon is a cautious man, sir, a very\r\ncautious man.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is this person?\" asked Marlow, pointing to the personage who\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"A messenger of the powers that be,\" replied Mr. Hastings; \"it seems\r\nthat because Sir John Fenwick dined here a short time ago, and has\r\nsince been accused of some practices against the state, his Majesty's\r\nadvisers have thought fit to connect me with his doings, or their own\r\nsuspicions, though they might as well have sent down to arrest my\r\nbutler or my footman, and I am now to have the benefit of a journey to\r\nthe Tower of London under arrest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or to Newgate,\" said the messenger, significantly.\r\n\r\n\"To London, at all events,\" replied Mr. Hastings.\r\n\r\n\"I will go with you,\" said Marlow, at once; but before the prisoner\r\ncould answer, the messenger interfered, saying, \"That I cannot allow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you must allow it,\" replied Marlow, \"whether it pleases\r\nyou or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will have no one in the carriage with my prisoner,\" said the\r\nmessenger, striking the table gently with the haft of his knife.\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" answered Marlow; \"but you will not, I presume, pretend\r\nto prevent my going where I please in my own carriage; and when once\r\nin London, I shall find no difficulty, knowing Mr. Vernon well.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter announcement made a great change in the messenger's\r\ndemeanor, and he became much more tame and docile from the moment it\r\nstruck his ear.\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings indeed would fain have persuaded his young friend to\r\nremain where he was, and looked at Emily with some of that tenderer\r\nfeeling of a parent which so often prompts to every sacrifice for a\r\nchild's sake. But Emily thanked Marlow eagerly for proposing to go;\r\nand Mrs. Hastings, even, expressed some gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements were soon made. There being no time to send for\r\nMarlow's own carriage and horses, it was agreed that he should take a\r\ncarriage belonging to Mr. Hastings, with his horses, for the first\r\nstage; the prisoner's valet was to accompany his friend, and immediate\r\norders were given for the necessary preparations.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, Emily asked some question of her father, in a low\r\ntone, to which he replied, \"On no account, my child. I will send for\r\nyou and your mother should need be; but do not stir before I do. This\r\nis a mere cloud--a passing shower, which will soon be gone, and leave\r\nthe sky as bright as ever. We do not live in an age when kings of\r\nEngland can play at foot-ball with the heads of innocent men, and I,\r\nas you all know, am innocent.\"\r\n\r\nHe then embraced his wife and child with more tenderness than he was\r\nwont to show, and entering the carriage first, was followed by the\r\nmessenger. The other men mounted their horses, and Marlow did not\r\nlinger long behind the sad cavalcade.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nPhilip Hastings had calculated much upon his Roman firmness; and he\r\ncould have borne death, or any great and sudden calamity, with\r\nfortitude; but small evils often affect us more than great ones. He\r\nknew not what it is to suffer long imprisonment, to undergo the\r\nwearing, grinding process of life within a prison's walls. He knew not\r\nthe effect of long suspense either, of the fretful impatience for some\r\nturn in our fate, of the dull monotony of long continued expectation\r\nand protracted disappointment, of the creeping on of leaden despair,\r\nwhich craves nothing in the end but some change, be it for better or\r\nfor worse.\r\n\r\nThey took him to Newgate--the prison of common felons, and there, in a\r\nsmall room, strictly guarded, he remained for more than two months. At\r\nfirst he would send for no lawyer, for he fancied that there must\r\neither be some error on the part of the government, or that the\r\nsuspicion against him must be so slight as to be easily removable. But\r\nday went by on day, and hour followed hour, without any appearance of\r\na change in his fate. There came a great alteration, however, in his\r\ncharacter. He became morose, gloomy, irritable. Every dark point in\r\nhis own fate and history--every painful event which had occurred for\r\nmany years--every doubt or suspicion which had spread gloom and\r\nanxiety through his mind, was now magnified a thousand-fold by long,\r\nbrooding, solitary meditation. He pondered such things daily, hourly,\r\nin the broad day, in the dead, still night, when want of exercise\r\ndeprived him of sleep, till his brain seemed to turn, and his whole\r\nheart was filled with stern bitterness.\r\n\r\nMarlow, who visited him every day by permission of the Secretary of\r\nState, found him each day much changed, both in appearance and manner;\r\nand even his conversation gave but small relief. He heard with small\r\nemotion the news of the day, or of his own family. He read the letters\r\nof his wife and daughter coldly. He heard even the intelligence that\r\nSir John Fenwick was condemned for high treason, and to die on a\r\nscaffold, without any appearance of interest. He remained\r\nself-involved and thoughtful.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a long interval--for the government was undecided how\r\nto proceed in his and several other cases connected with that famous\r\nconspiracy--a day was appointed for his first examination by the\r\nSecretary of State; for matters were then conducted in a very\r\ndifferent manner from that in which they are treated at present; and\r\nhe was carried under guard to Whitehall.\r\n\r\nVernon was a calm and not unamiable man; and treating the prisoner\r\nwith unaffected gentleness, he told him that the government was very\r\nanxious to avoid the effusion of any more blood, and expressed a hope\r\nthat Mr. Hastings would afford such explanations of his conduct as\r\nwould save the pain of proceeding against him. He did not wish by any\r\nmeans, he said, to induce him to criminate himself; but merely to give\r\nsuch explanations as he might think fit.\r\n\r\nPhilip Hastings replied, with stern bitterness, that before he could\r\ngive any explanations, he must learn what there was in his conduct to\r\nexplain. \"It has ever been open, plain, and straightforward,\" he said.\r\n\"I have taken no part in conspiracies, very little part in politics. I\r\nhave nothing to fear from any thing I myself can utter; for I have\r\nnothing to conceal. Tell me what is the charge against me, and I will\r\nanswer it boldly. Ask what questions you please; and I will reply at\r\nonce to those to which I can find a reply in my own knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought the nature of the charge had been made fully known to you,\"\r\nreplied Vernon. \"However, it is soon stated. You are charged, Mr.\r\nHastings, with having taken a most decided part in the criminal\r\ndesigns, if not in the criminal acts, of that unfortunate man Sir John\r\nFenwick. Nay, of having first suggested to him the darkest of all his\r\ndesigns, namely, the assassination of his Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suggest the assassination of the King!\" exclaimed Mr. Hastings. \"I\r\npropose such an act! Sir, the charge is ridiculous. Has not the only\r\nshare I ever took in politics been to aid in placing King William upon\r\nthe throne, and consistently to support his government since? What the\r\nministers of the crown can seek by bringing such a charge against me,\r\nI know not; but it is evidently fictitious, and of course has an\r\nobject.\"\r\n\r\nVernon's cheek grew somewhat red, and he replied warmly, \"That is an\r\nover-bold assertion, sir. But I will soon satisfy you that it is\r\nunjust, and that the crown has not acted without cause. Allow me,\r\nthen, to tell you, that no sooner had the conspiracy of Sir John\r\nFenwick been detected, and his apprehension been made known, than\r\ninformation was privately given--from your own part of the country--to\r\nthe following effect;\" and he proceeded to read from a paper, which\r\nhad evidently been folded in the form of a letter, the ensuing words:\r\n\"That on the ---- day of May last, when walking in the gardens of his\r\nown house, called 'The Court,' he--that is yourself, sir--used the\r\nfollowing language to Sir John Fenwick: 'When no other means can be\r\nfound of obtaining justice, freedom, and security, I see no reason why\r\na king should not be put to death as well as any other man. He who\r\ndoes the deed merits a monument rather than a gibbet.' Such was the\r\ninformation, sir, on which government first acted in causing your\r\napprehension.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary paused, and for a few moments Mr. Hastings remained\r\ngazing down in silence, like a man utterly confounded. Vernon thought\r\nhe had touched him home; but the emotions in the prisoner's bosom,\r\nthough very violent, were very different from those which the\r\nSecretary attributed to him. He remembered the conversation well, but\r\nhe remembered also that the only one who, besides Sir John Fenwick,\r\nwas with him at the moment, was his own child. I will not dwell upon\r\nhis feelings, but they absorbed him entirely, till the Secretary went\r\non, saying--\"Not satisfied with such slender information, Mr.\r\nHastings, the government caused that unhappy criminal, Sir John\r\nFenwick, to be asked, after his fate was fixed, if he recollected your\r\nhaving used those words to him, and he replied, 'something very like\r\nthem.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And I reply the same,\" exclaimed Philip Hastings, sternly. \"I did use\r\nthose words, or words very like them. But, sir, they were in\r\nconnection with others, which, had they been repeated likewise, would\r\nhave taken all criminal application from them. May I be permitted to\r\nlook at that letter in your hand, to see how much was really told, how\r\nmuch suppressed?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have read it all to you,\" said Mr. Vernon, \"but you may look at it\r\nif you please,\" and he handed it to him across the table. Philip\r\nHastings spread it out before him, trembling violently, and then drew\r\nanother letter from his pocket, and laid them side by side. He ran his\r\neye from one to the other for a moment or two, and then sunk slowly\r\ndown, fainting upon the floor.\r\n\r\nWhile a turnkey and one of the messengers raised him, and some efforts\r\nwere made to bring him back to consciousness, Mr. Vernon walked round\r\nthe table and looked at the two letters which were still lying on it.\r\nHe compared them eagerly, anxiously. The handwriting of the one was\r\nvery similar to that of the other, and in the beginning of that which\r\nMr. Hastings had taken from his pocket, the Secretary found the words,\r\n\"My dear father.\" It was signed, \"Emily Hastings;\" and Vernon\r\ninstantly comprehended the nature of the terrible emotion he had\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\nHe was really, as I have said, a kind and humane man, and he felt very\r\nmuch for the prisoner, who was speedily brought to himself again, and\r\nseated in a chair before the table.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, Mr. Hastings,\" said Vernon, \"we had better not protract this\r\nconversation to-day. I will see you again to-morrow, at this hour, if\r\nyou would prefer that arrangement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, sir,\" answered the prisoner, \"I will answer now, for\r\nthough the body be weak, the spirit is strong. Remember, however, that\r\nI am not pleading for life. Life is valueless to me. The block and axe\r\nwould be a relief. I am only pleading to prevent my own character from\r\nbeing stained, and to frustrate this horrible design. I used the words\r\nimputed to me; but if I recollect right, with several qualifications,\r\neven in the sentence which has been extracted. But before that, many\r\nother words had passed which entirely altered the whole bearing of the\r\nquestion. The conversation began about the regicides of the great\r\nrebellion, and although my father was of the party in arms against the\r\nKing, I expressed my unqualified disapprobation of their conduct in\r\nputting their sovereign to death. I then approached as a mere matter\r\nof abstract reasoning, in which, perhaps, I am too apt to indulge, the\r\nsubject of man's right to resist by any means an unendurable tyranny,\r\nand I quoted the example of Brutus and William Tell; and it was in the\r\ncourse of these abstract remarks, that I used the words which have\r\nbeen cited. I give you my word, however, and pledge my honor, that I\r\nentertained no thought, and had no cause whatever to believe that Sir\r\nJohn Fenwick who was dining with me as an old acquaintance,\r\nentertained hostile designs against the government of his native\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your admitted opinions, Mr. Hastings,\" said Vernon, \"seem to me to be\r\nvery dangerous ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" replied the prisoner, \"but in this country at least,\r\nsir, you cannot kill a man for opinions.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but those opinions, expressed in conversation with others who\r\nproceed to acts,\" replied Vernon, \"place a man in a very dangerous\r\nposition, Mr. Hastings. I will not conceal from you that you are in\r\nsome peril; but at the same time I am inclined to think that the\r\nevidence, without your admissions this day, might prove insufficient,\r\nand it is not my intention to take advantage of any thing you have\r\nsaid. I shall report to his Majesty accordingly; but the proceedings\r\nof the government will be guided by the opinion of the law officers of\r\nthe crown, and not by mine. I therefore can assure you of nothing\r\nexcept my sincere grief at the situation in which you are placed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I little heed the result of your report, sir,\" replied Mr. Hastings;\r\n\"life, I say, is valueless to me, and if I am brought to trial for\r\nwords very innocently spoken, I shall only make the same defence I\r\nhave done this day, and I shall call no witness; the only witness of\r\nthe whole,\" he added with stern, concentrated bitterness, \"is probably\r\non the side of the crown.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hastings was then removed to Newgate, leaving the two letters on\r\nthe table behind him, and as soon as he was gone, Mr. Vernon sent a\r\nmessenger to an inn near Charing Cross, to say he should be glad to\r\nspeak for a few moments with Mr. Marlow. In about half an hour Marlow\r\nwas there, and was received by Vernon as an old acquaintance. The door\r\nwas immediately closed, and Marlow seated himself near the table,\r\nturning his eyes away, however, as an honorable man from the papers\r\nwhich lay on it.\r\n\r\n\"I have had an interview with your friend, Mr. Marlow,\" said the\r\nSecretary, \"and the scene has been a very painful one. Mr. Hastings\r\nhas been more affected than I expected, and actually fainted.\"\r\n\r\nMarlow's face expressed unutterable astonishment, for the idea of\r\nPhilip Hastings fainting under any apprehension whatever, could never\r\nenter into the mind of any one who knew him.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" he exclaimed, \"what could be the cause of that? Not fear,\r\nI am sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something more painful than even fear, I believe,\" replied Mr.\r\nVernon; \"Mr. Hastings has a daughter, I believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, he has,\" replied Marlow, somewhat stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know her handwriting?\" asked the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, perfectly well,\" answered Marlow.\r\n\r\n\"Then be so good as to take up that letter next you,\" said Vernon,\r\n\"and tell me if it is in her hand.\"\r\n\r\nMarlow took up the paper, glanced at it, and at once said, \"Yes;\" but\r\nthe next instant he corrected himself, saying, \"No, no--it is very\r\nlike Emily's hand--very, very like; but more constrained.\"\r\n\r\n\"May not that proceed from an attempt to disguise her hand?\" asked\r\nVernon.\r\n\r\n\"Or from an attempt on the part of some other to imitate it,\" rejoined\r\nMarlow; \"but this is very strange, Mr. Vernon; may I read this\r\nthrough?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the Secretary, and Marlow read every word three\r\nor four times over with eager attention. They seemed to affect him\r\nvery much, for notwithstanding the Secretary's presence, he started up\r\nand paced the room for a minute or two in thought.\r\n\r\n\"I must unravel this dark mystery,\" he said at length. \"Mr. Vernon,\r\nthere have been strange things taking place lately in the family of\r\nMr. Hastings. Things which have created in my mind a suspicion that\r\nsome secret and external agency is at work to destroy his peace as\r\nwell as to ruin his happiness, and still more, I fear, to ruin the\r\nhappiness of his daughter. This letter is but one link in a long chain\r\nof suspicious facts, and I am resolved to sift the whole matter to the\r\nbottom. The time allowed me to do so, must depend upon the course you\r\ndetermine to pursue towards Mr. Hastings. If you resolve to proceed\r\nagainst him I must lose no time--although I think I need hardly say,\r\nthere is small chance of your success upon such evidence as this;\" and\r\nhe struck the letter with his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"We have more evidence, such as it is,\" replied Vernon, \"and he\r\nhimself admits having used those words.\"\r\n\r\nMarlow paused thoughtfully, and then replied, \"He may have used\r\nthem--he is very likely to have used them; but it must have been quite\r\nabstractedly, and with no reference to any existing circumstance. I\r\nremember the occasion on which Sir John Fenwick dined with him,\r\nperfectly. I was there myself. Now let me see if I can recall all the\r\nfacts. Yes, I can, distinctly. During the whole of dinner--during the\r\nshort time we sat after dinner, those words were never used; nor were\r\nconspiracies and treason ever thought of. I remember, too, from a\r\nparticular circumstance, that when we went out into the gardens Mr.\r\nHastings took his daughter's arm, and walked up and down the terrace\r\nwith Sir John Fenwick at his side. That must have been the moment. But\r\nI need hardly point out to you, Mr. Vernon, that such was not a time\r\nwhen any man in his senses, and especially a shrewd, cunning, timid\r\nman, like Sir John Fenwick, would have chosen for the development of\r\ntreasonable designs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were any other persons near?\" asked Vernon; \"the young lady might\r\nhave been in the conspiracy as well as her father.\"\r\n\r\nMarlow laughed. \"There were a dozen near,\" he answered; \"they were\r\nsubject to interruption at any moment--nay, they could not have gone\r\non for three minutes; for that pace of time did not elapse after the\r\ngentlemen entered the garden where the ladies were, before I was at\r\nEmily's side, and not one word of this kind was spoken afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what could have induced her to report those words to the\r\ngovernment?\" asked Mr. Vernon.\r\n\r\n\"She never did so,\" replied Marlow, earnestly; \"this is not her\r\nhandwriting, though the imitation is very good--and now, sir,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"if it be proper, will you explain to me what course you\r\nintend to pursue, that I may act accordingly? For as I before said, I\r\nam resolved to search this mystery out into its darkest recesses. It\r\nhas gone on too long already.\"\r\n\r\nVernon smiled. \"You are asking a good deal,\" he said, \"but yet my\r\nviews are so strong upon the subject, that I think I may venture to\r\nstate them, even if the case against Mr. Hastings should be carried a\r\nstep or two farther--which might be better, in order to insure his not\r\nbeing troubled on an after occasion. I shall strongly advise that a\r\n_nolle prosequi_ be entered, and I think I may add that my advice will\r\nbe taken.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think I have asked much already, Mr. Vernon,\" said Marlow, \"but I\r\nam now going to ask more. Will you allow me to have this letter? I\r\ngive you my word of honor that it shall only be used for the purposes\r\nof justice. You have known me from my boyhood, my dear sir; you can\r\ntrust me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly, my young friend,\" replied Vernon, \"but you must not take\r\nthe letter to-day. In two days the action of the government will be\r\ndetermined, and if it be such as I anticipate you shall have the\r\npaper, and I trust it will lead to some discovery of the motives and\r\ncircumstances of this strange transaction. Most mysterious it\r\ncertainly is; for one can hardly suppose any one but a fiend thus\r\nseeking to bring a father's life into peril.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fiend!\" exclaimed Marlow, with a scoff, \"much more like an angel,\r\nmy dear sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to think so,\" said Vernon, smiling, \"and I trust, though\r\nlove is blind, he may have left you clear-sighted in this instance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he has,\" answered Marlow, \"and as this young lady's fate is\r\nsoon to be united to mine, it is very necessary I should see clearly.\r\nI entertain no doubt, indeed, and I say boldly, that Emily never wrote\r\nthis letter. It will give me, however, a clue which perhaps may lead\r\nme to the end of the labyrinth, though as yet I hardly see my way. But\r\na strong resolution often does much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might it not be better for you,\" asked Vernon, \"to express your\r\ndoubts in regard to this letter to Mr. Hastings himself? He was\r\nterribly affected, as well he might be, when he saw this document, and\r\nbelieved it to be his own child's writing.\"\r\n\r\nMarlow mused for some time ere he replied. \"I think not,\" he answered\r\nat length; \"he is a man of peculiar disposition; stern, somewhat\r\ngloomy, but honorable, upright, and candid. Now what I am going to say\r\nmay make me appear as stern as himself, but if he is suffering from\r\ndoubts of that dear girl, knowing her as well as he does, he is\r\nsuffering from his own fault, and deserves it. However, my object is\r\nnot to punish him, but thoroughly, completely, and for ever to open\r\nhis eyes, and to show him so strongly that he has done his child\r\ninjustice, as to prevent his ever doing the like again. This can only\r\nbe done by bringing all the proofs upon him at once, and my task is\r\nnow to gather them together. To my mere opinion regarding the\r\nhandwriting, he would not give the slightest heed, but he will not\r\nshut his eyes to proofs. May I calculate upon having the letter in two\r\ndays?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you may,\" replied Vernon.\r\n\r\n\"Then when will Mr. Hastings be set free?\" asked Marlow; \"I should\r\nwish to have some start of him into the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will depend upon various circumstances,\" replied the Secretary;\r\n\"I think we shall take some steps towards the trial before we enter\r\nthe _nolle prosequi_. It is necessary to check in some way the\r\nexpression of such very dangerous opinions as he entertains.\"\r\n\r\nMarlow made no reply but by a smile, and they soon after parted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the writers upon German politics reproduces the story of the\r\nEnglishman, Frenchman, and German, who were required by some unknown\r\npower to draw a sketch of a camel. The Frenchman hied him to the\r\nJardin des Plantes, and came back with his sketch in no time. The more\r\nconscientious Briton at once took ship for the East, and returned with\r\nhis drawing from the life of nature. But the German went to the\r\nlibrary of the prince of his country to ascertain what a camel was. He\r\nlived to a great age, with the reputation of being very learned, and a\r\nlittle crazed with the depth of his researches, and on his death-bed\r\ntold his physician in confidence that he did not believe there was\r\nsuch an animal at all!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by G.

DE ST. GEORGES.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 211_\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--THE FOUR PULCINELLI.\r\n\r\nDoctor Matheus, as the reader must have guessed from the previous\r\nchapter, was Freiderick von Apsberg, one of the four Pulcinelli of the\r\nball of San Carlo, the young German who was the son of the venerable\r\npastor of the city of Ellogen, in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nFreiderick von Apsberg had been educated in one of the most celebrated\r\nuniversities of Germany, that of Leipsic,--where he had imbibed that\r\nvery social contagion, a passion for detestable demagogic fancies,\r\nwith which all those scientific _lazaretti_ of Germany were filled.\r\nThe dreamy and often poetic forms in which those ideas were\r\nenunciated, easily touched the heart of that long peaceable nation,\r\nand opened to it a field of mad and resistless hopes which could not\r\nbut plunge it into that abyss of disorder, trouble, and crime, in\r\nwhich it has been recently seen sweltering.\r\n\r\nFreiderick, not thinking his country yet prepared for the propagation\r\nof his principles, sought for an echo among other European nations.\r\nThe rising _Carbonarism_ of Italy opened its arms to him, and received\r\nhim as one of its future supporters. There he had become acquainted\r\nwith Monte-Leone, and participated in the religion of which he was the\r\nhigh priest. On his return to Germany, after his expulsion from Italy,\r\nhe had discovered that the work had advanced during his absence, that\r\nthe myth had been personified, and that the seed had germinated.\r\nGermany, especially the _poor_ of Germany, began to be deeply\r\nagitated; the _Carbonaro_ made many proselytes, and won many new\r\nmembers to the association. The death of his father having endowed him\r\nwith some fortune, he completed his studies, and became one of the\r\nmost fervent apostles of that mysterious science of which he spoke to\r\nthe Duke d'Harcourt; but, being made uncomfortable by the German\r\npolice, he left his country, after having established a connection\r\nwith the _Vente_ which had been formed there. He then came to France,\r\nwhere we find him under the name of Doctor Matheus, and living in the\r\nawful No. 13 of Babylonne street;--his house was the rendezvous of the\r\nprincipal members of the _Vente_ of Paris, where his profession amply\r\naccounted for the many visitors he received. His three friends,\r\nhowever, fearing that their frequent visits would be remarked, often\r\nhad recourse to disguises. Thus it is that we saw the Englishman, the\r\nAuvergnot, and the peasant, so cavalierly treated by Mlle Crepineau.\r\n\r\n\"This is the hour of consultation, my dear Doctor,\" said the Viscount\r\nto Von Apsberg; \"where are the patients?\" In a serious tone the\r\nlatter replied, \"In France, Italy, Germany, and all the\r\ncontinent.--Their disease is a painful oppression, an extreme\r\nlassitude in every member of the social body, a slow fever, and\r\ngeneral feeling of indisposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"What physician will cure so many diseases?\" asked the Viscount.\r\n\r\n\"_Carbonarism!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure of this?\" asked d'Harcourt, who, probably for the first\r\ntime in his life, said any thing reasonable. This was a doubt, almost\r\na defection to that cause into which his generous and enthusiastic\r\nnature had cast him. Rene d'Harcourt had originally formed but a\r\npassing intimacy with Monte-Leone, the object of which was pleasure\r\nalone. The latter, however, soon discovered his friend's courage and\r\ntruth, and ultimately initiated him in all his political mysteries and\r\ndreams. D'Harcourt, attracted by the occult power exerted by the Count\r\nover his associates, and led astray to a degree by his specious\r\ntheories in relation to national happiness, which Monte-Leone knew how\r\nto dress so well in the most energetic language, was carried away by\r\nthe temptation of becoming a political personage; perhaps, also, as la\r\nFelina said at the Etruscan villa, not a little under the influence of\r\nidleness, and the wish to be able to tell wonders of himself, joined\r\nin all these plots. He had become affiliated to the society of which\r\nMonte-Leone was the chief, and when he was expelled from Italy,\r\nrepresented himself to his particular friends as a martyr of political\r\nfaith: he had, by the by, a very faint confidence in it, and cared\r\nvery little about it; and this, even, was insensibly lessened when, on\r\nhis return to France and his family, he saw the high distinction which\r\nhis father enjoyed, and was aware that by rank and birth he would one\r\nday be called on to play a conspicuous part in the history of his\r\ncountry. He could not understand, therefore, how this country could\r\ndemand a general convulsion to obtain a hypothetical better, in place\r\nof a positive good.\r\n\r\nThis, as we have said, was the state of his mind, when Monte-Leone,\r\nTaddeo, and Frederick returned to Paris. They talked to him of his\r\noaths, of the pledge they had taken, of his position as a\r\n_Carbonaro_,--to which he would make no reply. The Viscount a second\r\ntime falling under the influence of Monte-Leone, captivated again by\r\nthe charms of friendship, and the glory of being the regenerator of\r\nhis country, fancied himself also bound by his honor to pursue the\r\npath on which he had entered. He therefore resumed his old chains, and\r\nbecame the SEIDE of a cause to which he was attracted neither by\r\nsympathy nor by reason.\r\n\r\nThe phrase which had escaped from the lips, or rather the good sense\r\nof the young man, sounded to Monte-Leone like a false note in a\r\nchorus. He said, \"Rene, God forbid that we should seek to link you to\r\nour fate if you do not believe in our cause. Remain inactive in the\r\nstrife about to ensue; your honor will be a sufficient pledge for your\r\nsilence in relation to our secrets. Henceforth be a brother to us only\r\nin love. Von Apsberg, the grand archivest of the association, will\r\nefface your name from our list; and whatever misfortune befall us, I\r\nshall at least have the satisfaction of knowing that you were not\r\ninvolved in our ruin.\"\r\n\r\nThis offer, instead of being received by Rene d'Harcourt, increased\r\nhis zeal, which otherwise would have died away.\r\n\r\n\"Leave you?\" said he,--\"abandon you, when the hour of danger has\r\ncome?--desert the field of battle when the combat is about to begin?\r\nMy friendship, my courage, and my honor, all forbid me to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThe four friends clasped their hands, and Monte-Leone said,--\"Now\r\nlisten to me, for time is precious. The _Vente_ of the kingdom of\r\nNaples, and those of all Italy, of which I refuse to be any longer the\r\nchief, do not on that account distrust me, but have just given me a\r\nstriking proof of their confidence. It is so great that I hesitate\r\neven to accept it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak,\" said all the friends at once.\r\n\r\n\"I have received this letter,\" said Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"The delegates of all the Italian _Vente_, relying on the prudence,\r\nvalor, and judgment of Count Monte-Leone, refer to him the decision of\r\nthe time when, and the manner in which, it is proper for them to\r\nmanifest their principles. Count Monte-Leone is requested to open a\r\ncommunication with the Vente of France, that there may be a\r\nsimultaneous movement with those of Italy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus,\" said the Count, \"in accepting this mission, I become the god,\r\nthe sovereign arbiter of this immense work, and have its fate in my\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg said, \"you have that of Italy and Germany--for the _Vente_\r\nof my country will act when I speak, or rather when you do.\"\r\n\r\nAn expression of pride flashed across Monte-Leone's face. He had\r\nevidently been mortified at not becoming supreme director, yet the\r\nstaff of command was again placed in his grasp. It was not now,\r\nthough, to confer the command of a single country, but, to use his own\r\nwords, he became the all-powerful controller of Europe, and, in his\r\nopinion, the hope of the universe. This strange man, made up of\r\ngreatness and littleness, like all the political idealists who erect\r\naltars to the creatures of their dreams, and ignorantly make a\r\nsacrifice of logic, good sense and reason--this man who sighed for\r\nuniversal liberty, was delighted at the prospect of great, despotic,\r\nand aristocratic power, to be exerted by his will alone in three great\r\ncountries. The Count then yielded willingly to the persuasions of his\r\nfriends, and promised to fulfil the wishes of the Italian _Vente_. He\r\nsaid, \"The time for action is not come. The French police, in fact,\r\nis busy only with the known enemies of the Government, with\r\npersons who are compromised in these petty plots originated by\r\nself-love--regret for the past, and ambition. Our object is greater;\r\nfor we do not serve a man, but an idea, or rather the assemblage of\r\nideas, to be expanded everywhere at once, and to replace the darkness\r\nof old civilization by torrents of far more dazzling light. The dawn\r\nof that light though has not yet come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet,\" said Von Apsberg, \"the notes I receive announce the formation\r\nof new _Vente_ on all sides of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Paris is filled with Carbonari,\" added d'Harcourt. \"Our secret and\r\nmasonic sign reveals the existence of brothers everywhere to me. I see\r\nthem in the public places, on the benches of the lawyers, and among\r\nthe very judges.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Von Apsberg, \"and as an evidence of what d'Harcourt says,\r\nlook at these voluminous names.\" The friends examined them carefully.\r\n\r\n\"It matters not,\" said Monte-Leone, \"too much precipitation would ruin\r\nall. Remember our device, _an auger piercing the globe_.\"\r\n\r\nDuring all this conversation, Taddeo had remained silent and\r\nthoughtful, and the Count at last observed it.\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" said he, \"why are you so sad? Can it be, like d'Harcourt\r\njust now, that you have any doubt or scruple about our cause? Do you\r\nhesitate at the dangers?\"\r\n\r\nTaddeo, as if he were aroused from a dream, said: \"The dangers I\r\nanxiously invite, as likely to free me from a life which is become a\r\nburden.\"\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone grew pale at these words, for he knew the reason of his\r\ndeep despair; and the iron of remorse pierced his heart. Before,\r\nhowever, Taddeo's friends could question him, a strange accident\r\nattracted the attention of the actors of this scene.\r\n\r\nA noise, at first faint and then louder, which resembled that of the\r\nspider in its web, suddenly interrupted the conversation. It seemed to\r\ncome from the interior of one of the panels.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is,\" said Monte-Leone, pointing at one of the book-cases.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Von Apsberg, with a sign of admiration.\r\n\r\n\"Can we have been overheard?\" said d'Harcourt.\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" said the false Matheus.\r\n\r\nThe Visconte and Taddeo at once took pistols from their pockets and\r\ncocked them.\r\n\r\n\"It is of no use,\" said the physician, pointing to the arms of his\r\nfriends. \"Put on your disguises, for it is unnecessary even that the\r\nbrothers should know you. Kant has said, _When there is a secret to be\r\nkept it is desirable that all who are intrusted with it should be\r\ndeaf, blind, and dumb_. Let us then tempt no one, and remember there\r\nis no one here but a doctor and two patients.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Count,\" said d'Harcourt, \"is he forgotten?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the doctor, \"he must be seen.\"\r\n\r\nThe noise increased, and something of impatience was remarkable in the\r\nlittle taps on the wood-work.\r\n\r\n\"It is he, is it not?\" said Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Frederick, \"for no one else uses that entrance.\"\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg then approached the library and touched a spring which\r\nthrew open a panel on which the books were arranged. With a key the\r\ndoctor then opened another door, through which a man entered. The day\r\nwas advanced, and the shades of night enwrapped almost all the room.\r\nThe scene we describe took place in the most remote and consequently\r\nin the darkest portion of the vast studio. The appearance of the man\r\nassumed a terrible and fantastic air.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! what is there so urgent that you trouble thus, my dear Pignana?\"\r\nsaid the Count to the new comer.\r\n\r\nSignor Pignana, our old Neapolitan acquaintance, the pretended tailor\r\nand owner of the Etruscan House, the mysterious guide of the Count\r\namong the ruins of San Paolo, bowed to the earth as he always did\r\nbefore the Count, and was evidently about to speak, when he stopped\r\nshort and pointed to the peasant and my lord, the profiles of whom he\r\ncould see distinctly in a moonbeam which came through one of the\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\n\"They are brethren,\" said Matheus, \"you may speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" said Pignana, piqued by the brusque manner of the Count,\r\n\"I thought the case _urgent_, (he accented the last word,) and\r\ntherefore came to warn your excellency of danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"What danger?\" asked the Count, with his usual _sang-froid_.\r\n\r\n\"And since his excellency,\" said Pignana, \"forbade me to come to his\r\nhouse, I was obliged to come here, though I believe my appearance is\r\nrespectable enough to pass scrutiny anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor Pignana, I must now, once for all, tell you the motives of my\r\nconduct. I would not do so in any case were I not satisfied how\r\ndevoted you are to me.\"\r\n\r\nPignana bowed again.\r\n\r\n\"Your appearance,\" said the Count, \"is certainly very honest and\r\nrespectable. The _fund_ of honesty is, however, perhaps not so good;\r\nfor as a smuggler, a skimmer of the seas----, but I stop here, lest I\r\nshould displease you, for you may, after all, have something on your\r\nconscience. There is, you know, a certain Neapolitan Ambassador at\r\nParis who was once a minister of police in our beautiful country. Now,\r\nSignor Pignana, people never have to do with the police without some\r\nvery unpleasant consequences. I have an idea also that the Duke of\r\nPalma, at whose house I was a fortnight ago, did not fail to inform\r\nthe Prefect of the Police of the city, of my being in Paris. This is\r\na delicate attention from one police to another. The Duke, also,\r\nprobably pointed out many of my old acquaintances, among whom you have\r\nthe honor to be; you will understand, by aid of your knowledge of\r\n_doubtful affairs_, that if it be known that I receive you here,\r\npeople will not think you come to teach me to play _the mandoline_, on\r\nwhich instrument you are, I learn, a great performer. Consequently,\r\nand not to rob myself of your invaluable services, and the care over\r\nmy household which you exercise, we have made a means of entrance for\r\nyou here, and through him you can communicate with me--how Signor\r\nPignana, an intelligent man like you, should understand this, without\r\nits being necessary for me to give all these details.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to be assured,\" said Signor Pignana, proudly, \"that\r\nwithout these grave reasons the Count would not be unwilling to see\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Taddeo, \"what is the danger of which you spoke just now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Signor Taddeo Rovero!\" said the shrewd Pignana, who had\r\nrecognized the voice of the young man.\r\n\r\n\"This is bad!\" murmured Frederick.\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to meet Signor Taddeo Rovero,\" said Pignana,\r\n\"especially as what I have to say relates also to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"To me?\" said Taddeo.\r\n\r\n\"Come to the point, then,\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"Thus it is, Monsignore,\" said Pignana: \"I was, in obedience to\r\norders, hanging about your excellency's house, and until to-day never\r\nsaw any thing suspicious. This evening I saw two dark figures planted\r\nopposite to your hotel, at the corner of Verneuil-street. The\r\nmotionless position of these men seemed strange, and the manner that\r\nthey examined others who came in and out of the hotel was more so,\r\nuntil at last I became satisfied that they watched you. I was\r\nconfirmed in this when approaching them in the dark I heard one of the\r\nmen say to his companion: '_He has gone out on foot, his carriage has\r\nnot left!_'\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said the Count, \"this becomes interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not all,\" said Pignana; \"the same man said in a brusque tone\r\nto his companion: '_Go to Saint Dominique-street, the other lives\r\nthere!_'\"\r\n\r\n\"That is myself,\" said Taddeo, \"and the Marquis, my sister, and I do\r\nlive in that street, in the Hotel of the Prince de Maulear.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I thought,\" said Pignana, bowing to Taddeo, \"and I hurried hither\r\nwhere I knew Count Monte-Leone was to be found. Your excellency will\r\nnow see that it was a matter of importance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not go home to-night!\" said d'Harcourt.\r\n\r\n\"Remain here!\" said von Apsberg.\r\n\r\n\"Leave Paris!\" said Pignana.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I not go home? Because it pleases some robber to wait near\r\nmy hotel, to rob me? or because some bravo wishes, _a la Venitienne_,\r\nto make a dagger-sheath of my heart? The man must act, too, _on his\r\nown account_, for I know of no enemies in this city. Every where I am\r\nsought for and _feted_, and our secret associates, with whom the world\r\nis full, and who know my old adventures, secure every day a triumphal\r\nreception for me in the saloons of Paris. But if the mysterious\r\nwatchers of whom Signor Pignana speaks, be by chance of the birds of\r\nnight--owls who have escaped from the police, I make myself more\r\nliable to suspicion by staying away, than by returning to my hotel.\r\nThen, by ----, as my old friend Pietro used to say--I did not furnish\r\na house to sleep out of it. To remain here as Von Apsberg suggests,\r\nwould be a greater mistake yet; for in this house are all our\r\ndocuments and the lists of our associates. This is the treasury, the\r\nholy ark of the society, and here, under the name of Matheus, is the\r\nvery soul. Let us then beware how we give the huntsman any clue to\r\nthis precious deposit, or all will be lost. Pignana proposes that I\r\nshould leave Paris, but I will not do so. Here are all our hopes of\r\nprobable success. The light which will illumine Paris, must radiate\r\nhence. Besides, gentlemen,\" continued Monte-Leone, \"I find that you\r\nall become easily excited at a very natural thing. In case even of a\r\njudicial investigation, you forget--_The brethren know each other, but\r\ncan furnish no evidence of the participation of each other in any\r\nenterprise_. Our records or our deeds alone can betray us; our papers\r\nare here beneath three locks, and our actions are yet to be. Do not,\r\ntherefore, be uneasy about my fate, and let Taddeo and myself discover\r\nthe explanation of this riddle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not be imprudent,\" said Von Apsberg to Monte-Leone, as he saw him\r\nhurriedly dress himself in the costume of an Auvergnat; \"remember that\r\nwe are in Paris, where the streets are crowded, and not in\r\nNaples--that a dagger-thrust is a great event here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not be uneasy,\" said the Count, \"for I always conform to the\r\nusages and customs of the country in which I am. In Italy I use the\r\ndagger, and in France the stick.\"\r\n\r\nTaking hold of the baton which Taddeo bore, more completely to assume\r\nthe roll of the villager, he brandished and twisted it in his fingers,\r\nwell enough to have made Fan-Fan, the king of the stick-players of the\r\nday, envious.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I follow your _eccelenza_?\" asked Signor Pignana.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said he, \"but as a rear-guard, twenty paces behind me, in\r\norder that you may give evidence, as a mere passer by, that the man I\r\nshall beat to death wished to beat me. This will make me more\r\ninteresting in the eyes of the people this difficulty will attract.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he saw Signor Pignana about to leave the room with him, he said,\r\n\"No! Mademoiselle Crepineau, the Argus of this house, saw only three\r\nmen come in; what will she think when she sees four leaving? Go out\r\nthen by the secret door, Pignana, and join us at the corner of the\r\n_rue_ Belle-Chasse.\"\r\n\r\nThe door of the library was closed on Signor Pignana.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not wish me to go with you?\" asked the Vicomte of Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"For shame!\" said Monte-Leone, \"four to one--we would look like the\r\nallied army marching against Monaco. Remain then a few minutes with\r\nthe doctor. The consultation of the Milord naturally enough may be\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\nThe Auvergnat and the peasant of the boulirue passed before the chair\r\nof Mademoiselle Crepineau, one with his handkerchief over his cheek,\r\nand the other with a bandage over his eye. Recollecting that they had\r\nbeen since eight o'clock with the doctor, she could not refrain from\r\nsaying, \"The doctor is a very skilful man, but he is slow. After all,\"\r\nadded she, \"he may have taken a multitude of things from them, though\r\nno one heard them cry out. People of their rank do not mind pain.\"\r\n\r\nAs they approached Verneuil-street, the Count proceeded a few steps in\r\nadvance of Taddeo. \"Wait for me here,\" said he, pointing out a house\r\nwhich stood yet farther back than the others, on the alignment of the\r\nstreet, \"and come to me if I call out.\" He then left the young man,\r\nassumed a vulgar air, and straggled towards his hotel. Soon he saw in\r\nan angle of the wall opposite to his house a motionless shadow, which\r\nwas certainly that of the man Pignana had pointed out to him. The\r\nCount had a quick and keen eye, which recognized objects even in the\r\ndark. He saw the two eyes which watched him, and which were fixed on\r\nhis hotel. They were moved from time to time, but only that on turning\r\nagain they might more easily recognize every passer. Monte-Leone, with\r\nthe presence of mind which never left him, and which characterized all\r\nthe decisive actions of his life, no sooner conceived his plan than he\r\nput it into execution. He was anxious to know with what enemies he had\r\nto deal, and could conceive of no better way than to question the man\r\nhimself. The question he put, it is true, was rather _brusque_, as\r\nwill be seen. When a few paces behind the man, who had not the least\r\nsuspicion, and had suffered him to come close to him, the Count faced\r\nabout and rushed on the stranger. He clasped his throat with one hand,\r\nand with the other seized the stranger's weapons, which he naturally\r\nenough concluded he wore. The latter uttered a cry, and an only cry,\r\nwhich, by the by, was terrible. He was then silent. A stranger passing\r\nby might have fancied those men were speaking confidentially together,\r\nbut never that one was strangling the other.\r\n\r\n\"One word,\" said Monte-Leone. \"Tell me why you are here.\"\r\n\r\n\"On my own business,\" said the man.\r\n\r\n\"That is not true,\" said the Count. \"You are not a robber--you have\r\nbeen here for two hours. Many persons well dressed have down this\r\nstreet, yet you did not attack them.\" The living vice which bound his\r\nthroat was again compressed. The man made a sign that he wished to\r\nspeak. The Count relaxed his hold.\r\n\r\n\"Whom do you watch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know me, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who bade you watch me?\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger was silent. Feeling the iron hand again clasp him, he\r\nmuttered, \"A great lady sent me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her name?\" said the Count, who began to guess, but who wished to be\r\nsure.\r\n\r\n\"The Neapolitan ambassadress.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why does your companion stand in the Rue Saint-Dominique?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you know all?\" said the wretch.\r\n\r\n\"All that I wish to,\" said the Count. \"Speak out,\" said he, again\r\nclasping his fingers tightly as if they had been a torture-collar.\r\n\"Speak now, or you will never do so again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the man, \"my companion is ordered to ascertain if you\r\nwere not at the hotel of the Prince de Maulear. Why should I know any\r\nthing about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! this is unworthy,\" said the Count. \"When her passions are\r\nconcerned nothing restrains this woman.\"\r\n\r\nA painful sigh was the only reply to this exclamation. The Count\r\nlooked around, and saw Taddeo standing by him, pale and trembling.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--A LETTER.\r\n\r\nLeaning over the white shoulders of the charming Marquise de Maulear,\r\nwe are about to tempt our readers to the commission of a great\r\nindiscretion. We will force them to listen to a letter which that lady\r\nwas writing to her mother the Signora Rovero, to inform the latter of\r\nall her secret thoughts, and of what during the last two years had\r\ntaken place in her household. She sat, one morning, about nine\r\no'clock, in a beautiful boudoir, hung with rose-colored silk, over\r\nwhich were falls of India muslin. This room was on the second floor of\r\nthe house, and there, with her head on her hand, Aminta wrote, on a\r\nsmall table incrusted with Sevres porcelain, the following letter,\r\nexhibiting the most intimate thoughts of her soul:\r\n\r\n     \"MY KIND MOTHER: Twenty months ago I left Italy and\r\n     yourself, to accompany the Marquis de Maulear and his\r\n     excellent father to Paris. Since then my letters have not\r\n     suffered you to want details of things about which you are\r\n     so curious, which occurred in the course of my trip from\r\n     Naples hither, and of my reception by my husband's family.\r\n     The family of the Marquis, as you already know, is one of\r\n     the most important of Paris, both from rank, fortune, and\r\n     nobility, and did not therefore dare to receive with\r\n     coldness a stranger who came thus to take a place in its\r\n     bosom. The tender protection of my father-in-law made it a\r\n     duty to them to seem to me what they really were to him,\r\n     benevolent, kind, and affectionate. Long ago, I saw that the\r\n     sentiments they exhibited were not sincere; and I guessed\r\n     that beneath the affectionate manners of my new family,\r\n     there was hidden an icy vanity, and want of sympathy with\r\n     the young woman who had no ancestors, no birth, and almost\r\n     no fortune, who had thus, as it were, come among them to\r\n     usurp name, position, and influence, to which no one should\r\n     pretend who had not a lineage at least as princely as\r\n     theirs. I soon learned how little faith I should have in\r\n     their politeness, and the anxiety in my behalf which were\r\n     exacted by the _exigences_ of society, and above all by the\r\n     paternal protection of the Prince de Maulear. I was eager to\r\n     find in the friendship of those with whom I was cast\r\n     something of that kind reciprocity of sentiments which I was\r\n     anxious to exhibit to them. The first person to whom I\r\n     appealed replied to me by cold glances. On this person, dear\r\n     mother, I relied, not as a substitute for yourself, but as\r\n     one to advise me in the new life I was about to lead amid a\r\n     society the customs and language of which I was almost\r\n     ignorant of. This person was the Countess of Grandmesnil,\r\n     sister of the Prince, and aunt of my husband. The Countess\r\n     was passionately fond of my husband, whom she educated, and\r\n     perhaps was wounded at the idea of his having married\r\n     without consulting her. This union also put an end to hopes\r\n     which had long before been formed in relation to a similar\r\n     connection with that of the Duke d'Harcourt's, one of the\r\n     first families in France. Mademoiselle de Grandmesnil,\r\n     therefore, received me with cautious urbanity, repelled my\r\n     confidence, and made me look on her whom I had considered an\r\n     affectionate protectress as an enemy. The Marquis was not\r\n     aware of the Countess's sentiments to me, for when they saw\r\n     how fond he was, they redoubled their apparent care and\r\n     attention. I did not, though, remain ignorant of the thorn\r\n     hidden in the rose. This strange kind of intuition, dear\r\n     mother, which you have often remarked in me, was made\r\n     apparent by the most unimportant acts of the Countess, in\r\n     which she evidently exhibited an expression of her\r\n     indifference to me, and dissatisfaction at my marriage; I\r\n     armed myself with courage, and promised to contend with the\r\n     enemy provided for me by my evil fate. I resolved not to\r\n     suffer my husband to know any thing of my troubles, nor to\r\n     suffer the Countess's treatment to diminish my husband's\r\n     attachment towards the person who had provided for his\r\n     youth. To recompense me, however, for this want of\r\n     affection, I had two substitutes--the perpetually increasing\r\n     love of the Marquis, his tender submission to my smallest\r\n     wish, and the attachment of the Prince--an enigma he has\r\n     always refused to explain. Beyond all doubt this reason is\r\n     powerful and irresistible, for the mention of my father's\r\n     name made him open his arms, which, as I told you, he at\r\n     first was determined to close hermetically. Strange must\r\n     have been those talismanic sounds, changing the\r\n     deeply-rooted sentiments of an old man's heart, and making\r\n     him abandon the invariable principles of his mind, so as to\r\n     induce him to present me, the daughter of a noble of\r\n     yesterday, as one descended from a person whose virtues had\r\n     won for him an immortal blessing. I must also tell you that\r\n     I have seen more than one of the old friends of the Prince\r\n     stand, as if they were petrified, at hearing him speak thus.\r\n     I have recounted all those happy scenes, dear mother, merely\r\n     to compare the past with the present, which presents, alas,\r\n     a far different aspect. My brilliant sky is obscured--I see\r\n     in the horizon nothing but clouds. Perhaps I am mistaken,\r\n     and my too brilliant imagination, against which you have\r\n     often warned me, fills my mind with too melancholy ideas.\r\n     Were you but with me, could I but cast myself in your arms,\r\n     press you to my heart, and imbibe confidence from you!\r\n     Listen, then, to words I shall confide to this cold paper,\r\n     read it with the eyes of your soul, and tell me if I am\r\n     mistaken or menaced with misfortune.\r\n\r\n     \"During the early portion of my residence in Paris, I lived\r\n     amid a whirlwind of pleasures, balls, and entertainments,\r\n     which soon resulted in satiety and lassitude. The attention\r\n     I attracted, the homage paid to me, flattered my vanity, and\r\n     pleased me; for they seemed to increase the Marquis's love,\r\n     and to make me more precious to him. After the winter came a\r\n     calmer season, and I welcomed it gladly, thinking the\r\n     Marquis and myself, to a degree, would live for each other,\r\n     and that this feverish, agitated and turbulent life, would\r\n     be followed by a period of more happiness. Three months\r\n     passed away in that kind of retirement in which those\r\n     inhabitants of Paris, who do not leave the city, indulge.\r\n     The Prince left us to visit his estates in another part of\r\n     France, and the Marquis and myself were alone. The Countess,\r\n     it is true, was with us; but her society, instead of adding\r\n     to our pleasures, was as annoying as possible. Accustomed\r\n     during my whole life to out-door existence, to long\r\n     excursions in the picturesque vicinity of our villa, I was\r\n     sometimes anxious to take morning strolls in the beautiful\r\n     gardens of Paris. The Countess said to my husband, one day,\r\n     that a woman of my age should not go out without him. As the\r\n     Marquis often rode, an exercise with which I am not\r\n     familiar, and as he had friends to see, and political\r\n     business to attend to, I was unable to go out but rarely.\r\n     Then I will say he offered me his arm anxiously, but this\r\n     exercise neither satisfied my taste, nor the demands of\r\n     health. There was also a perpetual objection to dramatic\r\n     performances, of which I was very fond; Henri did not like\r\n     them. The Countess, also, from religious scruples, was\r\n     opposed to them, and by various little and ingeniously\r\n     contrived excuses, I was utterly deprived of this innocent\r\n     amusement. My toilette was also a subject of perpetual\r\n     comment. The Countess said that I exaggerated the fashions,\r\n     that I looked foreign, and that the court was opposed to\r\n     innovations in the toilette, or again that the court\r\n     preferred the severe forms of dress. A young and brilliant\r\n     princess, though, gives tone to her court, and by her\r\n     elegance, luxury and taste, procures a support for crowds of\r\n     the Parisian work-people. Henri, over whom his aunt has\r\n     never ceased to exercise the same influence she did in\r\n     childhood, while he wished to support my ideas, really\r\n     supported hers. I saw with regret that the chief defect of\r\n     the Marquis was weakness of character, and perpetual\r\n     controversies about little matters produced a state of\r\n     feeling between us, which subsequently required a kind of\r\n     effort for us to overcome. This, however, dear mother, is\r\n     nothing; for I have not come to the really painful point of\r\n     my confessions. The gay season has returned, and the\r\n     principal people of Paris have returned to their hotels. I\r\n     liked to see Henri jealous, because this passion was, in my\r\n     opinion, an assurance of his love. Henri, who during the\r\n     early period of our marriage, would not have left me alone\r\n     for the world, now confides me exclusively to the care of\r\n     his father. The first time this took place, his absence was\r\n     a plausible excuse. He does not now even seek a pretext; a\r\n     whim, an appointment, are sufficient motives for him to\r\n     leave me. Whither does he go? How does he occupy himself?\r\n     This is the subject of my uneasiness and torment--yet he\r\n     loves me, he says, but a heart like mine, dear mother, is\r\n     not easily deceived. He does not love me as he used to. A\r\n     magnificent ball was given during the last month, by the\r\n     Neapolitan Ambassador, the Duke of Palma, who married the\r\n     famous Felina. Henri left the Prince and myself, as soon as\r\n     we came to the rooms; the whole night nearly passed away\r\n     without our seeing him. At last, however, he returned, pale\r\n     and exhausted. The Prince, who was unacquainted with what\r\n     had transpired at Sorrento, between his son and Monte-Leone,\r\n     introduced me to him, and asked me to receive him at our\r\n     hotel. I hesitated whether I should consent or not; when the\r\n     Marquis, with an air which lacerated my very heart, asked\r\n     the Count to visit me, assuring him that he would always be\r\n     welcome.\r\n\r\n     \"_Welcome to him!_ dear mother. You understand that this man\r\n     had been his rival, and loved me. I will confess to you,\r\n     dear mother, as I do to God. He loves me yet, I am sure,\r\n     though he never told me so; for his looks are what they\r\n     were, and when he spoke, his emotion told me that he was\r\n     unaltered. Since that ball, Monte-Leone, thus authorized by\r\n     the Marquis, has visited me. My husband is not at all\r\n     displeased at it; tell me, do you think he loves me still?\r\n     Yesterday, dear mother, I went into my husband's room, to\r\n     look for a bottle of salts I had forgotten. The Marquis was\r\n     absent, and his secretary was open, a strange disorder\r\n     pervaded the room; a few papers were lying about, and among\r\n     others, I saw a column of figures; I was about to look at\r\n     them, and had already extended my hand towards it, when I\r\n     heard a cry, and on turning around saw my husband, pale and\r\n     alarmed. He advanced towards me, and seizing my arm\r\n     convulsively, said, Signora, who gave you a right to examine\r\n     my papers? It is an abuse of confidence which I never can\r\n     forgive. I grew pale with surprise and grief. 'Sir, said I,\r\n     such a reproach is unmerited, if there be any thing\r\n     improper, it is your tone and air.' I left the room, for I\r\n     was overpowered, and did not wish to weep before him. One\r\n     hour afterwards, on his knees, he besought me to pardon him\r\n     for an excitement which he would never be able to pardon\r\n     himself. He was once more, dear mother, kind as he had ever\r\n     been; he repeated his vows of eternal love, and exhibited\r\n     all his former tenderness. His looks hung on me as they used\r\n     to, and I began to hope he would continue to love me. A\r\n     cruel idea, however, pursued me, what was the secret shut up\r\n     in the paper he would not suffer me to read? Why did he,\r\n     usually so calm and cold, become so much enraged?\"\r\n\r\nJust then the letter of the Marquise de Maulear was interrupted by the\r\nbell which announced the coming of visitors. Aminta remembered that it\r\nwas reception day, and persons came to say that several visitors\r\nawaited her. She went down stairs. On the evening of the same day she\r\nresumed her letter.\r\n\r\n     \"I resume my pen to tell you of a strange circumstance which\r\n     occurred to-day. When I broke off so suddenly, I found some\r\n     visitors awaiting me. Visiting in Paris is insignificant and\r\n     meaningless, performed on certain fixed days. Conversation\r\n     on these occasions is commonplace. People only talk of the\r\n     pleasure of meeting, and slander is so much the vogue that\r\n     it is not prudent to leave certain rooms until every one\r\n     else has gone, lest you should be hacked to pieces by those\r\n     left behind. My father-in-law came into the room and gave\r\n     some life to the conversation. The Prince was not alone, for\r\n     Count Monte-Leone came with him. Why, dear mother, should I\r\n     conceal from you, that the presence of the Count causes\r\n     always an invincible distress? This man is so decided and\r\n     resolute that he never seemed to me like other people. He\r\n     seems half god and half demon. His keen and often expressive\r\n     glance, his firm voice made mild by emotion, the _tout\r\n     ensemble_ of his character, seems to call him to great\r\n     crimes or sublime actions.\r\n\r\n     \"The Prince said, 'Do you know, Aminta, that the Count is\r\n     the only person in Paris whom I have to beg to come to see\r\n     you? I have absolutely to use violence. I had just now\r\n     almost to use violence to bring him hither.'\r\n\r\n     \"'The Prince, Madame,' said the Count, respectfully, 'looks\r\n     on respect as reserve. The pleasure of seeing you is too\r\n     great for me to run the risk of losing it by abusing the\r\n     privilege.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Bah! bah!' said the Prince, 'mere gallantry, nothing more.\r\n     We _emigres_, from associating with the English, have lost\r\n     some of our peculiarities; and I, at least, have contracted\r\n     one excellent custom. When an Englishman says to a man, \"my\r\n     house is yours,\" he absolutely means what he says, and the\r\n     privilege should be used. Your host looks on you as a part\r\n     of his family, and people of the neighborhood esteem you as\r\n     much a part of the household as the old grandfather's chair\r\n     is. You go, come, sit at the table, eat and drink, as if you\r\n     were at home. This generous hospitality pleases me, because\r\n     it recalls that of our own ancestors.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Brother,' said the Countess, 'this hospitality can never\r\n     be acclimated in France, especially in households where\r\n     there are as pretty women as in ours.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Sister, such privileges are accorded only to people of the\r\n     honor of whom we are well-assured, like the Count. Besides,\r\n     travellers like ourselves are hard to please in beauty. Not\r\n     that the Marquise is not beautiful; but if you had been as\r\n     we were at Ceprano, if you had only read the interesting\r\n     chapter I have written in relation to that country, you\r\n     would see that many perfections are needed to wound hearts\r\n     that are so cosmopolitan as ours.'\r\n\r\n     \"The Count was about to reply, when the doors were opened\r\n     and the Duchess of Palma was announced. I looked at\r\n     Monte-Leone just then, and he changed countenance at once. I\r\n     saw him immediately go to the darkest part of the room. This\r\n     was the first time I had ever received the Duchess of Palma.\r\n     There seemed no motive for her visit. I had paid mine after\r\n     the ball, and there was no obligation between us. The\r\n     Duchess is a beautiful, elegant, and dignified woman. It is\r\n     said she is of a noble family; and her manners evidently\r\n     betoken high cultivation. The Duchess told me kindly that\r\n     she had not seen enough of me at the ball, and that I must\r\n     take the visit as an evidence of her devotion and\r\n     admiration. The Prince of Maulear approached. 'We are\r\n     especially flattered, Duchess,' said he, and he emphasized\r\n     the word, looking at the same time at some ladies I\r\n     received; 'we are especially flattered by the honor you\r\n     confer on us. We know how careful you are in the bestowal of\r\n     such favors. It is a favor, as pleasant as it is honorable.'\r\n\r\n     \"'I have been suffering, Prince,' replied the Duchess, 'with\r\n     deep distress, and I will not reflect on any one the burden\r\n     of my sorrows.'\r\n\r\n     \"'You are,' said the Prince, 'like those beautiful tropical\r\n     flowers, the source of the life of which is the sun, and\r\n     which grow pale on their stems in our land. Neapolitans need\r\n     Naples, the pure sky, the balmy air, the perfume of orange\r\n     groves, and the reflection of the azure gulf. I am\r\n     distressed, Duchess, at what you say, and hope you will\r\n     content yourself with our country. We will not permit you to\r\n     leave it.'\r\n\r\n     \"'But I am dying,' said the Duchess, in a strange tone.\r\n\r\n     \"'You are now alive, though,' said the Prince.\r\n\r\n     \"The uneasy eyes of the Duchess passed around the room, and\r\n     when she saw the Count, became strangely animated. 'Ah!' she\r\n     remarked, 'here is Count Monte-Leone.' The Count advanced.\r\n\r\n     \"'The Count,' said the Prince, 'is your compatriot, and one\r\n     of your most fervent admirers.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Do you think so?' said the Duchess, almost ironically.\r\n\r\n     \"'One,' said the Prince, 'to be any thing else, must neither\r\n     have seen nor heard your grace.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Once, perhaps,' said she, 'I had some means of attraction,\r\n     but now all is forgotten; for I am a Duchess like all\r\n     others--less even, because I am indebted to chance for my\r\n     rank and title.'\r\n\r\n     \"'You owe thanks to yourself alone,' said the Prince, 'and\r\n     the Duke was a lucky man to have it in his power to lay them\r\n     at your feet.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Madame,' said I to the Duchess, 'since you deign to remind\r\n     us of your deathless talent, may I venture to ask you to\r\n     sing once more?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Never!' said the Duchess, 'I left my voice on the banks of\r\n     the _Lago di Como_, and have not forgotten my last song.'\r\n\r\n     \"''Twas indeed a sad epoch,' said the Prince, 'If it was the\r\n     funeral of your talent.'\r\n\r\n     \"'I will never sing again!' said the Duchess, 'I remember\r\n     that day as I do all the unhappy ones of my life. Ah! they\r\n     are far more numerous than our happy days. It was evening,\r\n     and in a gay room of my villa, whither I had come still\r\n     trembling at having seen a traveller nearly drowned in the\r\n     lake. I know not what sad yet pleasant memory was nursed in\r\n     my heart, but I went to my piano and sung an air I had sung\r\n     for the last time at San Carlo. Tell me, Count\r\n     Monte-Leone--you were there--what was it?'\r\n\r\n     \"'_La Griselda._'\r\n\r\n     \"'It was. On that evening all my enthusiasm returned to me.\r\n     While singing, however, a strange fancy took possession of\r\n     me. I thought I saw in the mirror in front of me, the\r\n     features of one who had long been dead--dead at least to me.\r\n     My emotion was so instinct with terror and happiness, that\r\n     since then I have not sung.'\r\n\r\n     \"'That is a perfect romance,' said the Prince, 'like those\r\n     of the dreamy Hoffman I met at Vienna.'\r\n\r\n     \"'No, sir, it is a fact, or rather the commencement of a\r\n     series of facts, which, however, will interest no one here.\r\n     For that reason I do not tell it.'\r\n\r\n     \"The Duchess of Palma rose to leave. The Prince offered her\r\n     his hand.\r\n\r\n     \"'No, Prince,' said she, 'I will not trouble you, for I am\r\n     about to ask the Count to accompany me. Excuse me,' said\r\n     she, 'excuse me for taking him away, but I need not use\r\n     ceremony with a countryman.'\r\n\r\n     \"Without giving him time to reply, she passed her arm\r\n     through his, went out, or rather dragged him out with her.\r\n\r\n     \"I do not know why, dear mother, I have told you all this\r\n     long story, which has led me to write far differently from\r\n     what I had intended. I like, though, to talk so much with\r\n     you; and then the visit of the Count and that Duchess\r\n     agitated me, I know not why. Some instinct tells me those\r\n     mysterious beings exert an influence over my life. You think\r\n     me foolish and strange--but what can I do? I am now so sad\r\n     that I seem to look at life through a dark veil. I am wrong,\r\n     am I not? Reassure yourself and tell me what you think of my\r\n     husband's conduct. That, most of all, interests\r\n\r\n                                \"Your own AMINTA.\r\n\r\n     \"P.S.--The Prince, the Countess and myself in vain waited\r\n     all day for the Marquis. It is now midnight and he has not\r\n     yet come.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--JEALOUSY.\r\n\r\nA month had passed since the Marquise had written to her mother,\r\nduring which time the Marquis, more sedulous in his attentions to\r\nAminta, had begun to make her forget her fears and suspicions. A new\r\nevent, though, aroused them again.\r\n\r\nA magnificent ball had been given by Madame de L----, in her splendid\r\nhotel in the _rue_ d'Antin. M. de L---- aspired to the ministry; and\r\nthe fact of his having received the Duke de Bevry at his magnificent\r\nentertainments, the favor he enjoyed at the _chateau_, and his\r\nfrequent entertainments to the _corps diplomatique_, seemed to make\r\nhis final success certain. M. de L---- aspired to popularity by\r\nattracting around him all who seemed likely to advance his views. He\r\ndelighted to receive and mingle together in his drawing-room all the\r\npolitical enemies of the tribune and the press, who, meeting as on a\r\ncentral ground, thought themselves obliged to boast of the wit of\r\ntheir Amphitryron, beneath whose roof they exchanged all the phrases\r\nof diplomatic politeness to the accompaniment of Collinet's flageolet,\r\nsat together at the card-tables, and courteously bowed at the door of\r\nevery room. On this account they did not cease to detest each other,\r\nthough their apparent reconciliation being believed at court,\r\ncontributed in no little degree to the advancement of M. L----'s\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis and Aminta were at the ball--and Henri left his wife for\r\nseveral hours in charge of his father, who was proud of her, and\r\nexhibited her with pride in all the rooms. The Prince heaped attention\r\non her, as all well-bred persons love to on those who are dear to\r\nthem. He carefully waited on her during every waltz and contra-dance;\r\nand with paternal care replaced the spotless ermine on her whiter\r\nshoulders. Then resuming his task of cicerone, he explained to her the\r\npeculiarities of French society, which seemed so brilliant and\r\nsingular to a young Italian. The Marquis rejoined his wife about one\r\no'clock. He was very gay, and Aminta had not for a long time seen him\r\nso amiable and lively. The Prince expressed a desire to return home,\r\nand the young people gladly consented. As they were about to leave the\r\nlast room, an Englishman of distinguished air, but pale and agitated,\r\npassed close to the Marquis, and as he did so, said in his native\r\ntongue, \"all is agreed.\" The Marquis replied in the same words, and\r\nthe Englishman left. Aminta asked what the stranger had said, \"Nothing\r\nof importance,\" said Henri, \"a mere commonplace.\"\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour after, the carriage of the young people entered\r\n_rue_ Saint Dominique. The Prince embraced the Marquise and retired to\r\nhis room, which was in the left wing of the hotel, and exactly\r\nopposite the apartments of the young couple. About two all the hotel\r\nwas quiet. Aminta, though, from some peculiar presentiment, could not\r\nsleep, yet, with her eyes half closed, she fell into that dreamy\r\ntorpor in which every passion is exaggerated. In this half-real,\r\nhalf-fantastic state, Aminta saw pass before her all the important\r\nevents of her life, the horrible episode of the _casa di Tasso_, the\r\ncoming of Maulear, and the heroic devotion of _Scorpione_. Another\r\nshadow, that of Monte-Leone, glided before her. The looks of this man\r\nwere fixed on hers, as if to read the depths of her soul. There came\r\nalso a thousand chimeras and countless mad and terrible fictions. La\r\nFelina, pale and white as a spectre, sang, or sought to sing, for\r\nthough her lips moved no sound was heard. With her hand raised towards\r\nAminta, the ducal singer seemed to heap reproaches on her. Alarmed at\r\nthese sombre visions, the young woman sought to return to real life,\r\nand arose from her bed; just then she thought she heard a door open.\r\nTerrified, she reached toward a bell near her, but paused. The door\r\nwhich was opened could be no other than that of the Marquis, for their\r\napartments, though separate, were side by side. She thought, too, that\r\nthe _valet de chambre_ had been detained later than usual with the\r\nMarquis, and unwilling to make an alarm, she repressed her agitation.\r\n\r\nNo noise disturbed the profound silence. The clock above struck the\r\nseveral hours with that slow and monotonous regularity, which is so\r\npainful to those who cannot sleep; she did not, however, win the rest\r\nshe was so anxious for. All the fancies which had occupied her just\r\nbefore had disappeared, but were replaced by a newer fancy, occasioned\r\nby the remark of the Englishman, which she had not understood. The\r\nfeatures of the stranger, so deathly pale, constantly returned to her.\r\nShe fancied some danger menaced the man to whom she had devoted her\r\nlife; that a strange danger menaced him, and, yielding to a feverish\r\nagitation, which she could not repress, wrapping herself in a shawl,\r\nand afraid almost to breathe, she went to the Marquis's room, when at\r\nthe door she paused and thought.\r\n\r\n\"What would Henri say, and how could she excuse this strange visit?\"\r\nShe hesitated and was about to return, when she saw that the door was\r\nnot closed, and that she could thus enter his room and satisfy herself\r\nwithout disturbing him. She decided--the door turned on its hinges,\r\nand Aminta entered. Crossing the antechamber, she had reached the\r\nbedroom, which was separated from it by a curtained door. She advanced\r\nto the bed, which she found had not been slept in. With a faint cry of\r\nterror she sank on an arm-chair. The clock struck four, and when she\r\nhad heard the noises which had disturbed her it was nearly two; since\r\nthen, therefore, the Marquis had been away. Yet this had occurred when\r\nhe was within a few feet of her, and the care and secrecy with which\r\nit was accomplished showed that it had been premeditated. Not a sound\r\nexcept the opening of the door had reached Aminta's ears. The Marquise\r\nfelt the most agonizing distress--no thought of perfidy, however,\r\nannoyed her; the idea of danger only occupying her mind. Just then her\r\neyes fell on an open note which had doubtless been dropped by Maulear\r\namid his hurry and trouble. She took it up, saying to herself, this\r\nnote doubtless contains a challenge--a rendezvous--she approached the\r\nnight lamp, and with difficulty suppressing her agitation, read as\r\nfollows--\"Dear Marquis, do not fail to come to-night. You know how\r\nanxiously you are expected,\r\n\r\n                                    \"FANNY DE BRUNEVAL.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter was indeed a rendezvous, but not of the kind she had\r\nexpected. The terms of the note were clear and precise; and the\r\nwoman's name dissipated the mist from before her eyes, Maulear had\r\ndeserted her and his home in the silence of night for such a person.\r\nShe it was whom he deceived--she who had been so loyal and true, she\r\nwho sought, even when Maulear asked her hand, to protect him--who\r\nbegged him to distrust his impressions and not to act in haste. \"I was\r\nright,\" said she, \"to fear the bonds he wished to impose on me--I was\r\nright to object to a marriage which could not make him happy--only two\r\nyears,\" said she, with a voice of half stifled emotion, \"and he is\r\nalready cold and indifferent to me. He has already abandoned me--and\r\nworse still, he has done so with treachery. Mother! mother! why did\r\nyou not keep me with you? This then, is the reward of my generous\r\ndevotion. Alas! when I accepted him--when I wrested him from the death\r\nwhich menaced him--when I gave myself to him, I did not love him, I\r\ndid not hesitate when perhaps----\" Aminta blushed amid her tears.\r\n\"Above all,\" said she, \"I do not wish him to find me here--I do not\r\nwish him to reproach me as he has done with seeking to penetrate his\r\nsecrets.\" She returned to her room, and from exhaustion and tears sank\r\non her bed.\r\n\r\nDay came at last, and Aminta dressed herself. She wished to conceal\r\nfrom her servants all that she suffered. Above all, she did not wish\r\nthe conduct and disorder of the Marquis to be made a subject of\r\ndiscussion. When her _femme de chambre_ entered her room, she found\r\nher mistress on her knees at her morning devotions before a crucifix.\r\nHad any persons, however, approached the Marquise, they must have seen\r\nthe tears falling on the delicate fingers which covered her face, and\r\nheard her sobs. The bell rang for breakfast. Aminta started as if from\r\na dream; being thus recalled to real life, she saw that while the\r\nevening before she had been happy and gay, one night had converted all\r\nto sorrow and suffering. Aminta, though ordinarily of strong nerve,\r\nsank beneath the blow. She felt herself wounded in her heart, her\r\ndignity, and in her confidence, by one for whom alone she had lived.\r\nHenceforth her life would be uncertain, and circumstances might lead\r\nher she knew not whither.\r\n\r\nWhen the Marquise entered, the Prince and Countess were about to go to\r\nthe table. The former said, \"It is evident, my child, from your face,\r\nthat you are fatigued; and that balls are to you what the sun is to\r\nroses. It does not detract from their beauty, but it makes them pale.\"\r\nAnd finally, the Countess added, \"it withers them completely. That is\r\nthe fate of all young women who turn night into day, and who, like my\r\nbeautiful niece, only really live between evening and morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said the Prince, \"that will not do. My sister is like the fox\r\nin the fable, she finds the ball too gay to suit herself, or rather\r\nherself too sombre for the ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"A witticism,\" said the Countess, \"is not a reason, but often exactly\r\nthe reverse. The one, my brother is familiar with; to the other, I am\r\nsorry to say, he is more a stranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, my child,\" said the Prince, with an air of submission and\r\nresignation, \"it is not well to have any trouble with the Countess,\r\nfor she returns shot for shot; though she fires a pistol in reply to a\r\ncannon. Luckily for us, she is not a good shot. But my son does not\r\ncome down. Can it be that, though he did not dance, he is more\r\nfatigued than his wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"A letter for Madame la Marquise, from the Marquis,\" said a servant.\r\n\r\nAminta took the letter from the plateau, and looked at the Prince, as\r\nif to ask whether she should read it.\r\n\r\n\"Read, my child, read,\" said her father-in-law, affectionately. \"The\r\nletter of a husband loved and loving, for thank God both are true,\r\nshould be read without any delay.\"\r\n\r\nAminta unsealed the letter, and glanced rapidly over it. Then\r\nsuccumbing to emotion, deprived of strength and courage, and\r\nespecially revolting at what she had read, felt her sight grow dim,\r\nand finally fainted. The Countess, whose mind alone was embittered for\r\nthe reasons Aminta had explained to her mother, but whose soul and\r\nheart were generous as possible, ran to the Marquise, took her in her\r\narms, and was as kind as possible. The Prince, paler than Aminta,\r\nrushed towards the window, which he threw open, and pulled away at the\r\nbell-ropes to call the servants, and send them for the physicians.\r\nThe old nobleman exhibited the greatest alarm. The young Marquise was\r\ntaken to the drawing-room, and a few moments after she opened her\r\neyes. Her heart, however, was crushed; and she wept bitter tears. The\r\nPrince was struck with terror and distress. He was alarmed for his\r\nson's sake, and a father's anxiety was apparent.\r\n\r\n\"What has happened to my son?\" said he, rushing to find the letter,\r\nwhich Aminta had let fall. He read it anxiously, and when he had\r\nconcluded, laughed loud and long. \"Indeed,\" said he, \"we have come\r\nback to the days of the Astraea. All reminds us of the _Calprenede_, of\r\n_Urfe_, or _Scuderi_ herself. We are on the _Tendros_. This kind of\r\nlove would make that of Cyrus and Mandane trifling. Cyrus writes to\r\nMandane, that he went out to ride in the Bois de Cologne, and\r\ntherefore has to deprive himself of the pleasure of breakfasting with\r\nher. Mandane therefore is suddenly taken ill. This is magnificent and\r\ntouching; but my precious child, it is a little exaggerated.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then, is the matter?\" said the Countess, as she handed her\r\nniece the salts. \"What a singular man you are! One never knows what\r\nthe facts of any thing are from you. You are either in the seventh\r\nheaven or in despair. Your very gayety is enough to destroy our\r\nniece's nerves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the Prince, \"how sorry I am for the nerves. Read, however,\r\nthe letter yourself, Countess,\" and he gave it to Mademoiselle\r\nGrandmesuil. \"You will see the Marquise is too fond of her husband.\r\nHer love has really become a dangerous passion. She is really\r\n_love-mad_, and if it continues, we shall have a rehearsal of Milon's\r\nballet, with the exception of _Bigotini_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Countess read as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR WIFE: I am unwilling to disturb your slumbers, and\r\n     have therefore left for the wood at five o'clock, having a\r\n     rendezvous with some sportsmen. We will probably breakfast\r\n     together, and I will not return until dinner-time. Remember\r\n     me affectionately.\r\n\r\n                                        \"HENRI.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe habitual coldness of the Countess returned while she read the\r\nletter. \"I will say that I think my nephew very likely to inspire deep\r\nlove. I cannot however conceive how there can be cause for such\r\ndespair. We Frenchwomen have not such an exaggerated devotion as our\r\nniece has. I beg her not to use it up now, for in the career of life\r\nshe will find it difficult to do without it.\" As if regretting that\r\nshe had soothed sorrows in which she had no sympathy, the Countess\r\nsent for her prayer-book, and went to mass. As soon as the young\r\nMarquise was alone with the Prince, she arose, threw herself in the\r\nold man's arms, and said: \"My father, I am very unhappy.\" The face of\r\nthe Prince at once became serious, and taking Aminta to a sofa, bade\r\nher sit down, and said, kindly as possible, \"Excuse my gayety and\r\nirony, my child. _Non est hic locus_, as the sublime Horace, the\r\nfavorite of our good king Louis XVIII., once wrote. I repent of my\r\nvolatility and trifling, for I should have remembered, when I think of\r\nthe elevation of your mind, that something more important than the\r\nabsence of your husband for a few hours annoyed you. Speak to me--open\r\nyour heart to me--for I love you too well not to have a right to your\r\nconfidence and your secrets.\"\r\n\r\n\"He does not love me,\" said Aminta, leaning her head on the Prince's\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! my daughter,\" said M. de Maulear, \"I am about to make a strange\r\nconfession to you. I am not acquainted with my son. His soul,\r\nsentiments, inclination, and moral nature, are unknown to me. When,\r\nfour years ago, I saw the child now twenty-six, whom I had left an\r\ninfant, and found his air, manners, and appearance distingue as\r\npossible, and was pleased with him, I was assured that his soul was\r\nexalted, his character true, and his sentiments honorable. I was\r\ntherefore satisfied. Two years after, he went to Naples, where I\r\nprocured a diplomatic post for him; and consequently I have neither\r\nstudied nor fathomed his instincts and habits. What I apprehend in\r\nrelation to you, my child, is a capital fault. I have discovered in my\r\nson an extreme weakness of character, which may lead him into error.\r\nFor that reason, I wrote to him, that I would have preferred that he\r\nhad tasted of the pleasures of life before marriage. I would thus have\r\nhad an assurance of his subsequent prudence. Believe me, though, my\r\nchild, I will watch over him and you, and if I was able to forgive his\r\nmarrying without my consent, when I knew whom he married, I never will\r\npardon him if he make her unhappy. The deuce! we did not bring you\r\nhither from Italy to break your heart.\"\r\n\r\nFearful lest his father should become angry with Maulear, Aminta\r\nrestrained the secret which seemed ready to burst from her lips. She\r\nspoke of vague suspicions and anxiety at the Marquis's uneasiness, but\r\nsaid nothing particular. The Prince, who never in his life had known\r\nwhat jealousy was, had some difficulty in understanding how it could\r\ncreate such despair. His attention, however, was not the less vigilant\r\nin relation to the affairs of the young couple. A circumstance which\r\noccurred soon after enabled him to ascertain much. A number of persons\r\nassembled one night at the rooms of the Marquise de Maulear. Count\r\nMonte-Leone had become one of Aminta's most assiduous visitors. The\r\ntacit permission he had received from Aminta, the formal authority of\r\nthe Marquis, the sympathy of the old Prince, to whom the pleasant,\r\nenergetic character of the Count, and his noble bearing, made him\r\nevery day more attractive--all taken in connection with the intimacy\r\nof Taddeo and Monte-Leone, authorized him to visit the Marquise\r\nfreely. The devotion of Monte-Leone to Aminta had never been\r\ndiminished. He had felt only an inclination towards La Felina, an\r\nerror of the senses and imagination, excited by mortified love, and\r\nfavored by the isolation of the Lago di Como. His heart had little\r\nshare in it. When, therefore, he saw the Marquise de Maulear more\r\nattractive than ever, he discovered that in his whole life he had\r\nloved her alone. The Marquis de Maulear appeared but rarely at the\r\nhotel, coming home at a late hour and going out early.\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone and Taddeo were talking together, and this fragment of\r\ntheir conversation struck the ear of the old Prince, who seemed\r\nentirely absorbed by a game of whist.\r\n\r\n\"Will not the Marquis be here to-night?\" said the Count to Taddeo.\r\n\r\n\"I doubt it: sometimes the master of the hotel is here less frequently\r\nthan any one else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he is now,\" said the Count, \"where he goes almost every\r\nnight, they say.\"\r\n\r\n\"You jest,\" said Taddeo; \"I think he is here every night.\"\r\n\r\n\"He should, but he is not. All I can say is, that on the night of\r\nM.L.'s ball, he was ... where I saw him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where was he?\" asked Taddeo, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you--but come away from the whist-table.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"But you do not return my lead,\" said the Prince's partner, \"you\r\nshould play hearts.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said the Prince, musing; and he led hearts. His eyes, though,\r\nfollowed Taddeo and Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\nThe Prince lost five points, much to his partner's discontent. He\r\nplayed very badly that night, breaking up his suits, mistaking the\r\ncards, and violating every rule, much to the surprise of the\r\nlookers-on, who knew how well he played the game, which the emigres\r\nhad imported from England. At last they stopped, and the Prince sought\r\nfor Monte-Leone through all the rooms. The Count and Taddeo, however,\r\nhad both left. The Marquis, though, had returned, and the company soon\r\ndispersed. The Prince went to his room, but soon left, well wrapped\r\nup, and with his hat over his face. \"Pardieu!\" said he, \"I will settle\r\nthings, and find out where my son passes the nights. Can any place be\r\nmore pleasant than the bedchamber of a pretty woman?\" Standing at a\r\nlittle distance from door, he waited about half an hour. His patience\r\nwas nearly exhausted, when the Marquis came out. Henri went to the Rue\r\nde Bac, took the quai, crossed the pont Royale, the Carousel, and\r\nentered la Rue de Richelieu. The poor Prince panted after him, and\r\nkept him in sight all the time, cursing his curiosity. Sustained by a\r\ndeep interest for his daughter's happiness, he kept on.\r\n\r\nWhen the Marquis came to the Rue de Menors, he paused, and turned to\r\nsee that no one followed him. The Prince had barely time to get behind\r\na coach which stood at the corner. The Marquis went some distance down\r\nthe Rue de Menors, and stopped at No. 7. The door was opened, and\r\nHenri entered. \"On my honor,\" said the Prince, \"I would not have come\r\nso far before bed, unless I could also have found out _why_ the\r\nMarquis visits No. 7.\" The Prince then stopped at the door, and\r\nknocked. The door was opened.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" said the porter, rather surlily.\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" said the Prince, and he put a louis d'or in the porter's\r\nhand, \"to know why that man has come hither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said he, pocketing the louis, \"it is a great deal to pay for\r\nso little. The gentleman has gone, as many others go, to see Mlle.\r\nFanny de Bruneval.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by\r\nStringer & Townsend, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of\r\nthe United States for the Southern District of New-York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FESTIVAL UPON THE NEVA.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE FROM THE FRENCH OF\r\nKAUFMANN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the banks of a majestic river, where, in later times, has arisen a\r\ncity of eight thousand houses, of granite causeways, monuments,\r\nobelisks, and palaces, nothing was to be seen at the commencement of\r\nthe eighteenth century but a few huts scattered over a marshy waste.\r\n\r\nOn one of those days, when the intense cold had transformed the river\r\ninto a plain of ice, a numerous crowd were hastening through the\r\nstreets of the young St. Petersburg. Some directed their steps towards\r\na little cottage; and others, over the frozen waters, towards a\r\nfortified island. Every one looked with a curious eye at the cottage,\r\nand the numerous sledges that were gathering for the escort at hand.\r\nPresently, a sledge drawn by three horses covered with bear-skins,\r\ndashed up to the cottage-gate. It was quickly opened, and an old man\r\nof a high stature and proud bearing came forth, wearing a blue sable.\r\nHe slowly advanced and took his place.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" said one of middle age, who hastened to take a seat\r\nby the side of the former, \"the gracious Czar had--\"\r\n\r\n\"It is sufficient,\" prince Menzikoff, interrupted the first, in a\r\nquick and stern tone; \"I am not much accustomed to wait, but I know,\r\nhowever, that it is the Czar only who can be the cause of this delay.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see the boyard, Alexis Nicolajewitz Tscherkaski,\" said one of\r\nthose present, in a whisper to his companion.\r\n\r\n\"You are not the first to tell me that,\" replied Nikita. \"It is not\r\nsixty years since his grandfather traversed the Caucasus with his\r\nsavage Tschetschences. He would be a little surprised if he saw his\r\nson to-day decorated with the golden key of chamberlain, and enjoying\r\nhimself at festivals in sacred Russia. But they give the signal of\r\ndeparture, for they are tying a tame bear to the sledge. Indeed, it is\r\na strange animal!\"\r\n\r\n\"I must see him nearer,\" said the first. \"Come, Andyuschka, let us\r\nsurvey the whole train.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey came at last to an edifice such as was never seen before or\r\nsince. It was built upon the Neva--but not of stones. The walls, roof,\r\nand partitions, were of solid ice; and the steps leading to the\r\nentrance cut out of one enormous block. Two large cannons made of ice,\r\npierced with the greatest care, and which they were foolish enough to\r\ncharge with powder, were placed in front of this singular palace. The\r\ninterior presented an appearance not less novel. A long table, formed\r\nof a single piece of ice, and covered with a hundred exquisite dishes,\r\nwas the principal object--oysters, in silver plates, excited the\r\nappetite--sea-fish, of every species, from the gulf of Finland and\r\nPont-Euxin to the Caspian and frozen seas, disputed the supremacy with\r\nshell-fish from the Istar and Volga. By the side of the hams of\r\nBayonne were roasts of bear surrounded with citron; and the sturgeon\r\nwas placed in the middle of delicious preserves. Many sledges were\r\nfilled with bottles.\r\n\r\nBut all these cold dishes composed but half the feast. Four kitchens,\r\nbuilt of wood, at some distance from the palace, threw up constantly\r\nclouds of smoke. There boiled stags and elks, pullets of Archangel,\r\nand boars of Podolie. But that which particularly attracted the\r\nattention of the spectators were the large fires where whole oxen\r\nturned round upon spits, for the benefit of the people, to whom were\r\nto be also given tuns of brandy.\r\n\r\nThe sun shone yet above the horizon when the great hall of the palace\r\nof crystal was lighted with wax candles in chandeliers of sparkling\r\nice. A thousand lights were thus reflected and broken upon the\r\ntransparent walls and windows. It seemed a fairy scene in the\r\napproaching night.\r\n\r\nWhile a legion of cooks, with their assistants, worked without\r\ncessation, the two personages, the boyard Tscherkaski and the prince\r\nMenzikoff, were not less busy in the interior of the palace. It was\r\nreadily seen that they had the charge of directing the festival about\r\nto commence. The last-mentioned, spreading a bear-skin upon each of\r\nthe seats of ice, was addressed by his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Truly, Alexandre Michailowitz, the Czar could not have selected a\r\nbetter manager of the feast than yourself. If I had any thing to do\r\nbut to take exclusive charge of the bottles, I am afraid I should\r\noblige every one to sit upon the naked blocks. What grimaces those\r\nhungry foreign guests would make, such as the Frenchman Lefort, and\r\nthose like him, whom the west is ever sending to fatten upon the blood\r\nof Russia. I should like to see them shivering to death, and at the\r\nsame time politely struggling to appear pleased in the presence of the\r\nCzar.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you know how the Czar would regard such pleasantry? You\r\nremember Dimitri Arsenieff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arsenieff! I hope you do not compound me with that herd whom a single\r\nglance of the Czar made tremble in their shoes. There was a time, it\r\nis true, but all is changed now--there was a time when those\r\nsubmissive slaves who filled the courts of the Kremlin, disappeared\r\nwhen they heard the steps of the old Alexis Nicolajewitz. His services\r\nwere once required. He was not idle during the massacre of the\r\nStrelitz; they had need of Tscherkaski then. But all this has passed\r\naway. I have but one wish; it is, that in the hour of trial the swords\r\nof those Frenchmen, or of other foreigners, may leap as slowly from\r\nthe scabbard as mine on that day when men of a nobler spirit were\r\nassassinated.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Czar has not forgotten that you have--\"\r\n\r\n\"O, truly,\" replied the boyard, with a bitter smile, \"the gracious\r\nCzar has made me the first chamberlain. He must have been in a good\r\nhumor at that time; for Poliwoi--you know him--he is skilful in\r\nsealing bottles--he was a _valet de chambre_ in his youth--and that\r\nEnglish Melton or Milton, who has imported some good dogs--both of\r\nthem, at the same time with myself, received the key of the\r\nchamberlaincy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you cannot deny, Alexis, that in general the choice of our\r\nsovereign--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the best. But what is strange about it is, that he finds so many\r\nexcellent men, and that he selects from so large a circle, when others\r\nwho, in times of calamity, are no longer considered unworthy, never\r\nobtain their turn for preferment.\"\r\n\r\n\"You appear to be not in a very good humor, to-day, boyard.... Would\r\nyou fall into disfavor with the Czar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" exclaimed the boyard, \"should I not tell a friend what probably\r\nhe will learn to-day, if indeed he is ignorant of it now? You know,\"\r\nhe continued with an affected calmness, \"the domain of the crown\r\nadjacent to my lands in Tula?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not,\" said the embarrassed Prince.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed you do, Alexandre Michailowitz; or at least you ought to. It\r\nseparates my property from yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! the manor.\"\r\n\r\n\"The same. It is not very extensive, containing only three villages\r\nand a thousand serfs. But its situation suits me and I desire its\r\npossession.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you ought to propose to the Czar to sell it. He will not refuse\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has already refused. 'I am sorry,' he coldly said, 'that I cannot\r\ngrant you the lands you ask; I have disposed of them to another.' I\r\nwas about to reply, but turning to speak to some one, he closed our\r\nconversation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you know to whom he granted the domain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who? Perhaps a vicious flatterer--an intrusive coward--some fellow\r\nfrom abroad who comes among us to appease his hunger; or, what is\r\nworse, an upstart, whose only pleasure is to overturn my dearest hopes\r\nto fulfil his own. Who is he? One of those who daily make fortunes by\r\nhundreds in our Russia, in place of meeting with the rope which they\r\nmerit--one of those who drive out honest men to occupy their places--a\r\nrustic bore, a cobbler, a pastry-cook!\"\r\n\r\nThe features of the boyard took an expression of the most violent\r\nanger; the muscles of his mouth contracted by a convulsive movement,\r\nand his fiery eye gave sign that he was remembering the sanguinary\r\nvengeance of his brethren, the sons of the Caucasus.\r\n\r\nThe countenance of Menzikoff grew dark. The word \"pastry-cook,\" in\r\nbringing to his recollection his former condition, awoke sentiments\r\nwhose expression it was difficult for him to restrain. \"I had\r\nintended,\" he said, \"to ask the Czar to give me those very lands; but\r\nI am glad that I have not done so. I would have been unhappy in\r\ninterfering with your projects, if it were even for the sake of your\r\namiable daughter, who, in your old days, will reward you largely for\r\nall the grievances you experience at the Court.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think so, eh, Michailowitz? But you are a Russian. You belong not\r\nto those foreign plebeians. Alexis Tscherkaski is a man who never\r\nhides what he thinks, and I confess frankly that I do not love you; I\r\nhave never loved you. Yet I do not confound you with those vile\r\nfavorites of whom I have spoken. You are the first who has ever said\r\nto my face that I was not born to walk in the slippery paths of a\r\ncourt. You will have the honor also of offering the first counsel that\r\nI have ever followed. Yes, Prince Menzikoff, I am firmly resolved to\r\nleave the capital in a few days. In my solitude, accompanied only by\r\nmy Mary, I hope to forget the Czars, their favors, and all that I have\r\ndone to obtain them. Since the death of my Fedor--but let us stop\r\nhere--with him all my hopes are buried. My daughter only remains--\"\r\n\r\n\"Who will be a glory to you in the evening of your life. She will\r\nbloom as the rose, she will be a mother of sons who--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I desire to see her happy. She will freely choose her husband;\r\nand if she wishes to unite her destiny with none, she shall live with\r\nme, and one day close my eyes in death. It is among the descendants of\r\nthe boyards that she will find her beloved. He shall be a noble son of\r\nold and sacred Russia. And I swear by all the saints interred in the\r\nconvent of Kiew, that no will, not even that of the Czar, but her own,\r\nshall influence the choice of my daughter.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince was about to reply, when loud voices were heard in front of\r\nthe house. \"They come! they come!\"\r\n\r\nA long train of sledges took the direction of the Isle of the Neva,\r\nand presented as strange a spectacle as one could well imagine.\r\nInstead of couriers who, according to the usages of the time, took the\r\nlead in this description of festivals, there was a sledge drawn by\r\nfour horses of different colors. In it were four men dressed in white\r\nwith a red girdle, having in their hands a staff ornamented with\r\nribbons, and upon their heads a bonnet decorated with plumes. The\r\noddest thing in this group was, that the youngest was not less than\r\nseventy; two of them wanted a leg; the third was without an arm; and\r\nthe fourth, blind.\r\n\r\nThen came two sledges filled with musicians who joyously sounded their\r\ninstruments. They were divided into two sections; the first would have\r\npleased the ear by their performances, if it were not for the second\r\nsection, every one of whom was deaf. They could not follow the\r\nmovements of the director, and he himself, also deaf, was constantly\r\nbehind the time, so that the two companies, although playing the same\r\nair, produced one which we might imagine proceeded from mischievous\r\ndemons in a concert prepared in Pandemonium for the benefit of\r\ncondemned musicians.\r\n\r\nIn a third sledge came a patriarch of eighty years. His long white\r\nbeard and hair carefully dressed, the precious ornaments with which he\r\nwas covered, and the priests seated at his side, all announced that\r\nthe old man was going to celebrate some solemn ceremony. As he was an\r\nintolerable stammerer, who had been released from the public services\r\nof the church during the greater part of his life, he was fitly chosen\r\nto deliver a discourse upon the present occasion.\r\n\r\nThe sledge following that of the patriarch's, gave to the cortege the\r\nunmistakeable character of a nuptial festivity; for, of the four\r\nindividuals who occupied it, two wore crowns, such as those prescribed\r\nby the Greek church to the newly married. The couple who sat in the\r\nplace of honor, and for whom this fete had been prepared were indeed\r\nvery curious looking persons. The bridegroom was an old and wrinkled\r\ndwarf, hardly four feet high. His enormous head seemed to weigh down\r\nhis slender body, and to bend his legs into the form of sabres. His\r\ntoilette was according to the French mode of that period. A frock coat\r\nof silver cloth, a sky blue vest and crimson velvet pantaloons, and\r\nimmense ruffles covered his long, sepulchral hands. A perruque with a\r\nlong tail, the nuptial crown, and a silver sword, which completed his\r\ndress, confirmed the remark of one of our friends, who compared the\r\nunfortunate bridegroom to a monkey on the rack.\r\n\r\nThe dwarf and his affianced resembled each other as two drops of\r\nwater. Upon the head of the hump-backed bride also shone the marriage\r\ncrown. Her dress was of gold cloth of the most recent Parisian mode.\r\nTheir exterior, however, presented a single contrast which rendered\r\nthem still more ridiculous; for upon the wide face of the future wife\r\nwas a presumptuous smile, while the husband, suffering under some\r\nrecent sorrow, made the most frightful grimaces.\r\n\r\nIn order better to distinguish the ugliness of this deformed couple,\r\nthere were placed upon the second seat of the sledge two children of\r\nangelic beauty--one a girl of five years; the other, a boy of six to\r\neight. They both wore the ancient Russian costume, which in its\r\nsimplicity so well became the celestial sweetness of the countenance\r\nof the rosy-cheeked girl, and the spiritual gayety which beamed from\r\nthe large black eyes of the boy. These children appeared destined to\r\nserve as bridesboy and bridesmaid; and certainly Hymen could not have\r\nmade a better choice.\r\n\r\n\"It is the daughter of the boyard Tscherkaski! It is the little Fedor\r\nMenzikoff!\" cried the crowd.\r\n\r\nA large number of sledges passed on. All those who occupied them were\r\ndisguised in the strangest manner. By the side of a coarse Kirghese\r\nwas a fashionable Parisien. Behind them a Chinese mandarin waited upon\r\na maiden Tyrolese. In the cortege could be seen not only the costumes\r\nof all the tribes under the sceptre of Peter the Great, but of almost\r\nevery nation of Europe and Asia. The masquerade extended even to the\r\ntrappings of the horses and sledges. Some of the horses' heads wore\r\ngilded horns of the stag and the elk, and others great wings, which\r\nmade them resemble the poet's idea of Pegasus. The last sledge in the\r\ntrain worthily closed this fantastic procession. It was drawn by three\r\nhorses, and contained a single personage. Two horsemen, habited as\r\nTurks, galloped by his side, and announced his high rank. His\r\nthick-set figure was of the ordinary height, his face was full of a\r\nspirit of gayety and frolic, and in the smile with which he responded\r\nto the acclamations of the people could be perceived his satisfaction\r\nin the preparations for the fete of the day. His dress was that of a\r\nnorthern countryman, and he who had ever seen one would be at a loss\r\nto say whether Peter the Great was an original or a copy.\r\n\r\nThe countryman held in his hand a large gold-headed cane, and\r\ntormented a tame bear, which, standing erect upon its hind feet, and\r\nfulfilling the functions of lackey, was from time to time punished for\r\nhis unskilfulness, to the amusement of the people.\r\n\r\nThe train arrived at the crystal palace; and although all had\r\ndescended from the sledges, none had crossed the threshold. Every one\r\nappeared desirous to yield the first entrance to the bridegroom and\r\nhis partner, or to him who gave the feast. Prince Menzikoff and the\r\nboyard at last advanced, bare-headed, into the presence of the Czar,\r\nwho was still occupied in teasing his bear to divert the multitude.\r\n\r\n\"What are you waiting for?\" he said, at the same time taking the cap\r\nof the Prince, and replacing it upon his head. \"Why these marks of\r\nrespect? Have you quite forgotten all the duties of gallantry in thus\r\npermitting the happy couple to wait at the door of the marriage-house?\r\nBut I see--and if I did not see, the odors of the dishes and of the\r\nbrandy would be evidence of it--that you have well performed your\r\nduties. With this conviction, Alexandre, that you have done well for\r\nthe palates of the guests by delicious dishes, and that my old\r\nTscherkaski does not permit me to have a doubt as to his performances\r\nconcerning the cellar--it is, I say, from these considerations that I\r\npardon you both for forgetting that I am and wish to be nothing more\r\nto-day than Peter, the countryman, who has come to celebrate with his\r\nfriends the nuptials of a couple who love each other tenderly. Come,\r\nlet us hasten, lest the temperature of the marriage-palace cool our\r\ndinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"As your Majesty wishes,\" responded the Prince, respectfully.\r\n\r\n\"Not Majesty,\" replied the Emperor, and in the same moment he ran to\r\nexcuse himself to the affianced for unintentionally causing them to\r\nwait so long.\r\n\r\nThey entered, and very soon the sound of music announced that they\r\nwere being seated at table. The Prince, at a sign from the Czar,\r\nconducted the bride and bridegroom to the place of honor, and beside\r\nthem the two children. The rest took their places without distinction\r\nof rank. The Holland ambassador sat next the Emperor, and in front of\r\nhim the boyard Tscherkaski, and Menzikoff sat next to Tscherkaski.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe conversation, at first grave and little animated, gradually became\r\nmore lively. The Czar was in a good humor, a thing which often\r\noccurred at the dinner-table, if nowhere else. Peter the Countryman\r\nwas not slow to assail the embarrassed couple with pleasantries, some\r\nmore or less good, and others rather equivocal. He at last requested\r\nthe old patriarch, who was perspiring with fear at the anticipation of\r\nthe request, to repeat the discourse which he had pronounced to the\r\ngreat pleasure of his Majesty. A noisy gayety filled the hall, and\r\noutside it was at its height. At the moment in which the Emperor\r\noffered a toast to the married couple, the cannon of ice was\r\ndischarged. It flew in pieces in every direction, and instead of\r\nproducing any serious sensation lest some accident might have\r\noccurred, it only increased the tumultuous hilarity. The wines of\r\nChampagne and Bourgogne ran in streams. The servants were hardly\r\nsufficient to supply the thirst of the guests. The Czar ordered to\r\ntheir assistance soldiers, who, taking half a dozen bottles under each\r\narm, rolled them as nine-pins upon the table--a circumstance which the\r\nambassador of the powerful states thought so remarkable that he\r\nmentioned it in his report a la Haye.\r\n\r\nThis intemperate drinking soon showed its effects upon the greater\r\npart of the guests. Peter gave himself up completely to the\r\ninfatuation of the vine, and Menzikoff, who preserved his accustomed\r\nsobriety, saw with inquietude the Czar swallow one after another\r\nnumerous glasses of Bourgogne. The face of the monarch became\r\nfoolish--the perspiration stood upon his forehead in large drops, and\r\nin order to cool himself he took off his perruque, and placed it upon\r\nthe head of his neighbor the ambassador, who received the insult\r\nrespectfully, but without power to repress a deep sigh. However\r\npleasant all this might have been, Menzikoff took no part in the\r\nenjoyments of the society, troubled as he was through fears founded\r\nupon an intimate knowledge of the character of his master. Experience\r\nhad too often taught him how easily the Czar passed from humor and\r\nhilarity to anger and violence. He knew that such changes took place\r\nalmost invariably after indulgences of the bottle, and that a single\r\nword--a single gesture--threw him into a passion that made him\r\ndetestable, while by nature he was generous and noble. The event\r\nproved how reasonable were the presentiments of Menzikoff.\r\n\r\nThe festival was coming to an end. The Czar arose and commanded\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"Hitherto,\" he said, in smiling, \"we have only drank to the health of\r\nthe happy pair. It is time to give them a substantial token of our\r\nfriendship. Since I am myself the originator of this joyful marriage,\r\nI must give the first example--so take that, Alexandre; put in it what\r\nI told you, and pass it round.\" At these words the Emperor pointed to\r\na little silver basket that lay on the table.\r\n\r\nMenzikoff took the basket, and drawing from his bosom a draft for 8000\r\nroubles, and emptying his own purse, passed the basket to his neighbor\r\nthe boyard. The latter seemed to reflect a moment, took from his\r\npocket a handful of gold and silver, and with an air of contempt, cast\r\nan old rouble into the basket, and passed it from him.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance did not escape the notice of the Emperor. His brow\r\ndarkened, but soon his gayety returned, and he said, smiling, to\r\nMenzikoff:\r\n\r\n\"You see, Alexandre, the prudence of our Prince de Tscherkaski. He\r\ngives only a rouble. He means to say by this that he has no very\r\nparticular interest in the married parties. It is only a ruse on his\r\npart in order to remove any jealousy that a greater gift might awaken.\r\nI will wager you that to-morrow he will send a present to the young\r\nwoman more becoming her rank and position.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty would lose the wager,\" responded Tscherkaski, in a\r\nhaughty tone. \"The farces of fools and jugglers have never amused me,\r\nand I have always pitied those who know not better how to employ their\r\ntime than to lose it with such creatures. Thus my contribution is at\r\nthe same time conformed to the circumstances and to my rank, since I\r\ndo not appreciate beyond measure the office of chamberlain, with which\r\nyou have gratified me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor at first smiled at these words, but his countenance became\r\nmore stern.\r\n\r\n\"Our chamberlain,\" said he, after a pause, \"gets angry to get calm\r\nagain. He must be in a bad humor to-day. I hope he will change his\r\nlanguage by the time that another affair occurs, which will interest\r\nhim more nearly.\"\r\n\r\nTscherkaski did or wished not to understand the words of the Czar. His\r\nwandering and disdainful eyes glanced at the basket offered to the\r\nbride and bridegroom. It was filled with gold, rings, bracelets,\r\njewels, and other precious gifts. The universal happiness of the\r\nevening had removed from the mind of the Czar the remembrance of the\r\nmurmurings of the boyard, and Menzikoff had hardly taken his place\r\nwhen the Emperor whispered to him:\r\n\r\n\"The dispositions you have made to-day in regard to this festivity do\r\nyou honor. You have perfectly agreed with my own taste in such\r\nmatters. You have surpassed my expectations.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not I alone,\" humbly replied the Prince. \"The boyard as well as\r\nmyself----\"\r\n\r\n\"Without doubt, you and he have perfectly fulfilled my intentions. I\r\ntake not into the account the silver rouble, however,\" added the Czar,\r\n\"let that be as it may, ten years hence this place shall be the scene\r\nof a similar festivity; and to let you see how I can surpass you, I\r\nwill myself take charge of the preparations. You may smile, Alexandre,\r\nbut you will be forced to admit, that without your aid I can arrange a\r\nnuptial feast. It is besides the less difficult, since the essentials\r\nare already decided upon--the persons to be married.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were overheard by those present, and a profound silence\r\nensued.\r\n\r\n\"Would I be guilty of too much curiosity,\" said Menzikoff, \"if....\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you wish to know the young couple,\" exclaimed the Emperor. \"I\r\nought, perhaps, to leave you in ten years' uncertainty; but thanks to\r\nthis brilliant society whom I invite from to-day, you will know now.\r\nAlexis Nicolajewitz,\" continued he, in addressing the boyard, \"you\r\nasked me the other day for certain lands near Tula, situated between\r\nthe boundaries of your property and those of Prince Menzikoff.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did, and your Majesty has thought fit to refuse them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I refused them, because I had reserved them for another. I wish to\r\ngive them as a dowry to your daughter.\"\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of the boyard was great He attempted to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Silence! I have attached to the grant one condition,\" said the Czar.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty will order nothing contrary to my conscience and the\r\nhonor of my house. I humbly ask, then....\"\r\n\r\n\"The condition is, that your daughter shall receive her husband at my\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have sworn upon the tomb of my wife,\" responded the boyard, after a\r\npause, \"that my daughter shall espouse him only whom she herself\r\nfreely chooses. But, she is still a child,... and in ten years....\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" interrupted the Emperor, whose countenance was sorrowful,\r\n\"if your daughter should not accept him whom I would propose, the\r\nlands will yet belong to her; are you content now?\"\r\n\r\n\"And the rank, the condition of the parties?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are to be the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"A single word from our gracious sovereign, is at any time sufficient\r\nto destroy all inequalities of rank,\" said one of the guests.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Kurakin,\" returned the boyard; \"as to myself, I rely\r\nupon the word of our monarch, who has just said that there is nothing\r\nto equalize. Every one to his opinion upon that which concerns him.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a tone of very high pride in your discourse, Alexis\r\nNicolajewitz,\" responded Peter, who repressed his anger with\r\ndifficulty. \"I have a great mind not to name to you to-day the husband\r\nwhich I, your sovereign, have chosen for the daughter of one of my\r\nsubjects. But let your insolent vanity subside. Your future son-in-law\r\nis of birth equal with your's and your daughter's; he is the only son\r\nof a man whom I dearly esteem and honor with distinguished favors. I\r\nsay it in his presence, and it is my desire he should be honored by\r\nothers. In a word, your future son-in-law is the companion of your\r\ndaughter at the feast to-day; he is the little Fedor Menzikoff.\"\r\n\r\nThis name came to the ears of the boyard as a thunder-clap, so great\r\nwas his astonishment. The assembly waited in vain his response, but he\r\nwas silent.\r\n\r\n\"Ah well, Alexis,\" continued the Czar, \"if these two manors are hardly\r\nworth thanks, why should I wait for you to consent to the proposed\r\nunion?\"\r\n\r\nAll eyes were directed to the boyard. No one spoke, and the Czar's\r\nimpatience yielded to a furious anger.\r\n\r\n\"And what motive,\" he at last said, \"induces you to reject this gift?\"\r\n\r\n\"The very condition that you have yourself made, gracious sovereign.\"\r\n\r\n\"The condition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that condition which requires my daughter to give her hand to\r\nthe son of Prince Menzikoff. It can never be fulfilled. It is\r\nimpossible to accept the gift of your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\" fiercely demanded Peter.\r\n\r\n\"The Czar orders--his servant must obey. Prince Menzikoff is the son\r\nof a serf, but the daughter of Tscherkaski shall never marry a man of\r\nso mean extraction,\" and the blood mounted to the brow of the boyard.\r\n\r\n\"Insolent dog!\" exclaimed Peter, striking his hand upon the table. \"Do\r\nyou not know that a single word from me can make ten serfs ten\r\nPrinces, and the least among them superior to you in rank and dignity.\r\nOh! by my patron, the prince of the Apostles, why should I patiently\r\nlisten to this haughty descendant of the brigands of the Caucasus. I\r\ncan do more than this, proud boyard; by a breath I can degrade thee\r\nand all thy tribe.\"\r\n\r\nHitherto Tscherkaski held his eyes downward, but now he lifted them\r\nand looked steadily at his monarch.\r\n\r\n\"Your look braves and menaces me,\" thundered the Czar, beside himself,\r\nand shaking his fist towards the boyard. \"Reply if you dare, and it is\r\nnot impossible that your rebellious head rolls from your body this\r\nvery night, this hour, this minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I do not doubt your power. How could I doubt the power of\r\none who, on the same day, without pity and without humanity, cut off\r\nthe heads of thousands. Surely, the man who tramples under his feet\r\nthose who were once the support of his crown and authority; who has\r\nnot only stained his own hands in their blood, but that of his own\r\nson--surely he would not hesitate to destroy an old servant, the\r\nnecessary but guilty instrument of his past vengeance. Come! the arm\r\nthat was steeped in the massacre of the Kremlin, can hardly take a\r\nredder hue from the blood of an unimportant slave.\"\r\n\r\nPeter looked with burning eyes upon his adversary. He arose, as by an\r\nimpulse, and inclining his head forward, seemed to be engaged in\r\ndiscovering the meaning of those vehement words. But he was\r\nendeavoring to stay the tempest that was sweeping over his heart. Some\r\nminutes elapsed before he recovered himself from those bitter\r\nrecollections; and looking with an affected air of calmness and\r\ndignity upon the astonished assembly, he said--\r\n\r\n\"Faithful Russians! you have heard the serious accusation brought by a\r\nsubject against his monarch. Whatever may be the number of the\r\nStrelitz fallen in an unhappy day, I am not at all concerned about it;\r\nthey died for the safety and well-being of sacred Russia. If innocent\r\nblood flowed at the Kremlin--if, among so many guilty, the sword\r\nsevered the head of one innocent, I am ready to defend the act. It was\r\nfrom me that the whole transaction originated; it is mine only, and I\r\ntake the responsibility of it. I had no other means of saving our\r\ncountry from the barbarism that encumbered it, and impeded its\r\nelevation to the rank which it should occupy among the nations of\r\nEurope. As the bold boyard has truly said, it is I who have brandished\r\nthe sword, and I ask who is the Russian who dares cite me to his\r\ntribunal?\"\r\n\r\nThe anger of the Czar was rekindled, and he began anew.\r\n\r\n\"It is to the tutelary patron of the empire that I am indebted for the\r\npower of having executed a resolution which I judged necessary. A\r\ndisease was undermining the constitution of the empire--the evil was\r\nterrible and appeared incurable: like a skilful physician I at once\r\nemployed the medicine which could alone be successful in arresting the\r\nprogress of the disease. Could I, in the moment of execution, place\r\nthe instrument in the trembling hands of a charlatan? No; it was my\r\nown hand that held the knife. I felt the wounds which I made; and I\r\nsay to-day, before God and man, it is I to whom the action belongs,\r\nand for which I am ready to answer on earth and on high. Now, as to\r\nyou, Tscherkaski, you have audaciously rejected the favor I was\r\nwilling to grant. You have not even feared to accuse your sovereign in\r\nthe midst of his subjects. If my ancestors were alive your white head\r\nwould fall from the block, but far from me the thought of shedding the\r\nblood of an old brother in arms. Retract, and you may pass your days\r\ntranquilly on your own lands. If not,\" and the voice of the Czar grew\r\nmore stern, \"I send you this night into eternal exile.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it permitted me to take with me my daughter?\" cooly asked the old\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"The child belongs to its parent,\" replied the Emperor, surprised and\r\nhesitating.\r\n\r\n\"Then, Alexander Michailowitz,\" said the boyard to Menzikoff, \"give me\r\ntwo of those bear-skins you placed upon the ice-chairs; it is all that\r\nis necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take him away at once; we have had enough of his arrogance and\r\naudacity!\" exclaimed the furious Peter, and he repelled Menzikoff, who\r\nwas endeavoring to intercede for the boyard.\r\n\r\n\"And whither?\" asked the prince with a trembling voice.\r\n\r\n\"To Bareson upon the Ob----No; to Woksarski upon the Frozen sea,\"\r\nadded Peter, as he beheld the smiling and triumphing air of the\r\nboyard.\r\n\r\nA few moments after the old man and his daughter entered a sledge. A\r\nparty of horsemen accompanied them, and away they went with the\r\nswiftness of an eagle towards the dreary regions of the north-west.\r\n\r\nTen years later, Prince Menzikoff, despoiled of his goods, his honors,\r\nand his rank, came to share the exile of the boyard. Similar\r\nmisfortune reconciled two enemies, and the union of their children\r\naccomplished the prediction of the Czar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITENESS: IN PARIS AND LONDON.\r\n\r\nBY SIR HENRY LYTTON BULWER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Je me recommande a vous,\" was said to me the other day by an old\r\ngentleman dressed in very tattered garments, who was thus soliciting a\r\n\"sou.\" The old man was a picture: his long gray hairs fell gracefully\r\nover his shoulders. Tall--he was so bent forward as to take with a\r\nbecoming air the position in which he had placed himself. One hand was\r\npressed to his heart, the other held his hat. His voice, soft and\r\nplaintive, did not want a certain dignity. In that very attitude, and\r\nin that very voice, a nobleman of the ancient \"regime\" might have\r\nsolicited a pension from the Duc de Choiseul in the time of Louis XV.\r\nI confess that I was the more struck by the manner of the venerable\r\nsuppliant, from the strong contrast which it formed with the demeanor\r\nof his countrymen in general: for it is rare, now-a-days, I\r\nacknowledge, to meet a Frenchman with the air which Lawrence Sterne\r\nwas so enchanted with during the first month, and so wearied with at\r\nthe expiration of the first year, which he spent in France. That look\r\nand gesture of the \"petit marquis,\" that sort of studied elegance,\r\nwhich, at first affected by the court, became at last natural to the\r\nnation, exist no longer, except among two or three \"grands seigneurs\"\r\nin the Faubourg St. Germain, and as many beggars usually to be found\r\non the Boulevards. To ask with grace, to beg with as little\r\nself-humility as possible, here perchance is the fundamental idea\r\nwhich led, in the two extremes of society, to the same results: but\r\nthings vicious in their origin are sometimes agreeable in their\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\"Hail, ye small sweet courtesies of life, far smoother do ye make the\r\nroad of it--like grace and beauty, which beget inclination at first\r\nsight, 'tis ye who open the door and let the stranger in.\" I had the\r\nSentimental Journey in my hand--it was open just at this passage, when\r\nI landed not very long ago on the quay of that town which Horace\r\nWalpole tells us caused him more astonishment than any other he had\r\nmet with in his travels. I mean Calais. \"Hail, ye small sweet\r\ncourtesies of life,\" was I still muttering to myself, as gently\r\npushing by a spruce little man, who had already scratched my nose and\r\nnearly poked out my eyes with cards of \"Hotel ...,\" I attempted to\r\npass on towards the inn of Mons. Dessin. \"Nom de D...,\" said the\r\nCommissionaire, as I touched his elbow, \"Nom de D..., Monsieur, _Je\r\nsuis Francais_! il ne faut pas me pousser, moi ... _je suis\r\nFrancais_!\"--and this he said, contracting his brow, and touching a\r\nmoustache that only wanted years and black wax to make it truly\r\nformidable. I thought that he was going to offer me his own card\r\ninstead of Mr. Meurice's. This indeed would have been little more than\r\nwhat happened to a friend of mine not long ago. He was going last year\r\nfrom Dieppe to Paris. He slept at Rouen, and on quitting the house the\r\nfollowing morning found fault with some articles in the bill presented\r\nto him. \"Surely there is some mistake here,\" said he, pointing to the\r\naccount. \"Mistake, sir,\" said the _aubergiste_, adjusting his\r\nshoulders with the important air of a man who was going to burthen\r\nthem with a quarrel--\"mistake, sir, what do you mean?--a mistake--do\r\nyou think I charge a sou more than is just? Do you mean to say that?\r\n_Je suis officier, Monsieur, officier Francais, et j'insiste sur ce\r\nque vous me rendiez raison!!_\" Now, it is undoubtedly very pleasant to\r\nan Englishman, who has the same idea of a duel that a certain French\r\nmarquise had of a lover, when, on her death-bed, she said to her\r\ngrand-daughter, \"Je ne vous dis pas, ma chere, de ne point avoir\r\nd'amans; je me rappelle ma jeunesse. Il faut seulement n'en prendre\r\njamais qui soient au-dessous de votre etat\"--it is doubtless very\r\nunpleasant to an Englishman, who cares much less about fighting than\r\nabout the person he fights with, to have his host present him a bill\r\nin one hand and a pistol in the other. In one of the islands which we\r\nought to discover, whenever the king sneezes all his courtiers are\r\nexpected to sneeze also. The country of course imitates the court, and\r\nthe empire is at once affected with a general cold. Sneezing here\r\nthen becomes an art and an accomplishment. One person prizes himself\r\non sneezing more gracefully than another, and, by a matter of general\r\nconsent, all nations who have not an harmonious manner of vibrating\r\ntheir nostrils are justly condemned as savages and barbarians. There\r\nis no doubt that the people of this island are right; and there is no\r\ndoubt that we are right in considering every people with different\r\nusages from ourselves of very uncivilized and uncomfortable behavior.\r\nWe then, decidedly, are the people who ought justly to be deemed the\r\nmost polite.\r\n\r\nFor instance--you arrive at Paris: how striking the difference between\r\nthe reception you receive at your hotel, and that you would find in\r\nLondon! In London, arrive in your carriage! (_that_ I grant is\r\nnecessary)--the landlord meets you at the door, surrounded by his\r\nanxious attendants; he bows profoundly when you alight--calls loudly\r\nfor every thing you want, and seems shocked at the idea of your\r\nwaiting an instant for the merest trifle you can possibly _imagine_\r\nthat you desire. Now try your Paris hotel--you enter the\r\ncourtyard--the proprietor, if he happen to be there, receives you with\r\ncareless indifference, and either accompanies you saunteringly\r\nhimself, or orders some one to accompany you to the apartments which,\r\non first seeing you, he determined you should have. It is useless to\r\nexpect another. If you find any fault with this apartment, if you\r\nexpress any wish that it had this little thing, that it had not that,\r\ndo not for one moment imagine that your host is likely to say, with an\r\neager air, that he \"will see what can be done\"--that he \"would do a\r\ngreat deal to please so respectable a gentleman.\" In short, do not\r\nsuppose him for one moment likely to pour forth any of those little\r\ncivilities with which the lips of your English innkeeper would\r\noverflow. On the contrary, be prepared for his lifting up his eyes,\r\nand shrugging up his shoulders, (the shrug is not the courtier-like\r\nshrug of antique days,) and telling you that the apartment is as you\r\nsee it, that it is for Monsieur to make up his mind whether he take it\r\nor not. The whole is the affair of the guest, and remains a matter of\r\nperfect indifference to the host. Your landlady, it is true, is not\r\nquite so haughty on these occasions. But you are indebted for her\r\nsmile rather to the coquetry of the beauty, than to the civility of\r\nthe hostess. She will tell you, adjusting her head-dress in the mirror\r\nstanding upon the chimney-piece in the little \"salon\" she\r\nrecommends--\"que Monsieur s'y trouvera fort bien, qu'un milord\r\nAnglais, qu'un prince Russe, ou qu'un colonel du ----ieme de dragons,\r\na occupe cette meme chambre\"--and that there is just by an excellent\r\nrestaurateur and a \"cabinet de lecture\"--and then--her head-dress\r\nbeing quite in order--the lady expanding her arms with a gentle smile,\r\nsays, \"Mais apres tout, c'est a Monsieur a se decider.\" It is this\r\nwhich makes your French gentleman so loud in praise of English\r\npoliteness. One was expatiating to me the other day on the admirable\r\nmanners of the English.\r\n\r\n\"I went,\" said he, \"to the Duke of Devonshire's, '_dans mon pauvre\r\nfiacre_:' never shall I forget the respect with which a stately\r\ngentleman, gorgeously apparelled, opened the creaking door, let down\r\nthe steps, and--courtesy of very courtesies--picked, actually picked,\r\nthe dirty straws of the ignominious vehicle that I descended from, off\r\nmy shoes and stockings.\" This occurred to the French gentleman at the\r\nDuke of Devonshire's. But let your English gentleman visit a French\r\n\"grand seigneur!\" He enters the antechamber from the grand escalier.\r\nThe servants are at a game of dominos, from which his entrance hardly\r\ndisturbs them, and fortunate is he if any one conduct him with a\r\ncareless lazy air to the \"salon.\" So, if you go to Boivin's, or if you\r\ngo to Howel's and James's, with what politeness, with what celerity,\r\nwith what respect your orders are received at the great man's of\r\nWaterloo Place--with what an easy nonchalance you are treated in the\r\nRue de la Paix! All this is quite true; but there are things more\r\nshocking than all this. I know a gentleman, who called the other day\r\non a French lady of his acquaintance, who was under the hands of her\r\n\"coiffeur.\" The artiste of the hair was there, armed cap-a-pie, in all\r\nthe glories of national-guardism, brandishing his comb with the grace\r\nand dexterity with which he would have wielded a sword, and\r\nrecounting, during the operation of the toilette--now a story of\r\n\"_Monsieur son Capitaine_\"--now an anecdote, equally interesting, of\r\n\"_Monsieur son Colonel_\"--now a tale of \"_Monsieur son Roi_, that\r\nexcellent man, on whom he was going to mount guard that very evening.\"\r\nMy unhappy friend's face still bore the most awful aspect of dismay,\r\nas he told his story. \"By G--d, there's a country for you,\" said he;\r\n\"can property be safe for a moment in such a country? There can be no\r\nreligion, no morality, with such manners--I shall order post-horses\r\nimmediately.\"\r\n\r\nI did not wonder at my friend--at his horror for so fearful a\r\nfamiliarity. What are our parents always, and no doubt wisely\r\nrepeating to us? \"You should learn, my dear, to keep _a certain kind\r\nof persons_ at their proper distance.\"\r\n\r\nIn no circumstances are we to forget this important lesson. If the\r\nclouds hurled their thunders upon our heads, if the world tumbled\r\ntopsy-turvy about our ears,\r\n\r\n    \"Si fractus illabatur orbis,\"\r\n\r\nit is to find the well-bred Englishman as it would have found the just\r\nRoman--and, above all things, it is not to derange the imperturbable\r\ndisdain with which he is enfeoffed to his inferiors. Lady D. was going\r\nto Scotland: a violent storm arose. Her ladyship was calmly dressing\r\nher hair, when the steward knocked at the cabin-door. \"My lady,\" said\r\nthe man, \"I think it right to tell you there is every chance of our\r\nbeing drowned.\" \"Do not talk to me, you impertinent fellow,\r\nabout drowning,\" said her aristocratical ladyship, perfectly\r\nunmoved--\"that's the captain's business, and not mine.\"\r\n\r\nOur great idea of civility is, that the person who is poor should be\r\nexceedingly civil to the person who is wealthy: and this is the\r\ndifference between the neighboring nations. Your Frenchman admits no\r\none to be quite his equal--your Englishman worships every one richer\r\nthan himself as undeniably his superior. Judge us from our servants\r\nand our shopkeepers, it is true we are the politest people in the\r\nworld. The servants, who are paid well, and the shopkeepers, who sell\r\nhigh--scrape, and cringe, and smile. There is no country where those\r\nwho have wealth are treated so politely by those to whom it goes; but\r\nat the same time there is no country where those who are well off live\r\non such cold, and suspicious, and ill-natured, and uncivil terms among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe rich man who travels in France murmurs at every inn and at every\r\nshop; not only is he treated no better for being a rich man--he is\r\ntreated worse in many places, from the idea that because he is rich he\r\nis likely to give himself airs. But if the lower classes are more rude\r\nto the higher classes than with us, the higher classes in France are\r\nfar less rude to one another. The dandy who did not look at an old\r\nacquaintance, or who looked impertinently at a stranger, would have\r\nhis nose pulled and his body run through with a small-sword--or\r\ndamaged by a pistol-bullet--before the evening was well over. Where\r\nevery man wishes to be higher than he is, there you find people\r\ninsolent to their fellows, and exacting obsequiousness from their\r\ninferiors--where men will allow no one to be superior to themselves,\r\nthere you see them neither civil to those above them, nor impertinent\r\nto those beneath them, nor yet very courteous to those in the same\r\nstation. The manners, checkered in one country by softness and\r\ninsolence, are not sufficiently courteous and gentle in the other.\r\nTime was in France, (it existed in England to a late date,) when\r\npoliteness was thought to consist in placing every one at his ease. A\r\nquiet sense of their own dignity rendered persons insensible to the\r\nfear of its being momentarily forgotten. Upon these days rested the\r\nshadow of a bygone chivalry, which accounted courtesy as one of the\r\nvirtues. The civility of that epoch, as contrasted with the civility\r\nof ours, was not the civility of the domestic or the tradesman, meant\r\nto pamper the pride of their employer, but the civility of the noble\r\nand the gentleman, meant to elevate the modesty of those who\r\nconsidered themselves in an inferior state. Corrupted by the largesses\r\nof an expensive and intriguing court, the \"grand seigneur,\" after the\r\nreign of Louis XIV., became over-civil and servile to those above him.\r\nBeneath the star of the French minister beat the present heart of the\r\nBritish mercer--and softly did the great man smile on those from whom\r\nhe had any thing to gain. As whatever was taught at Versailles was\r\nlearnt in the Rue St. Denis, when the courtier had the air of a\r\nsolicitor, every one aped the air of the courtier; and the whole\r\nnation with one hand expressing a request, and the other an\r\nobligation, might have been taken in the attitude of the graceful old\r\nbeggar, whose accost made such an impression upon me.\r\n\r\nBut a new nobility grew up in rivalry to the elder one; and as the\r\npositions of society became more complicated and uncertain, a supreme\r\ncivility to some was seen side by side with a sneering insolence to\r\nothers--a revolution in manners, which embittered as it hastened the\r\nrevolution of opinions. Thus the manners of the French in the time of\r\nLouis XVI. had one feature of similarity with ours at present. A\r\nmoneyed aristocracy was then rising into power in France, as a moneyed\r\naristocracy is now rising into power in England. This is the\r\naristocracy which demands obsequious servility--which is jealous and\r\nfearful of being treated with disrespect; this is the aristocracy\r\nwhich is haughty, insolent, and susceptible; which dreams of affronts\r\nand gives them: this is the aristocracy which measures with an\r\nuncertain eye the height of an acquaintance; this is the aristocracy\r\nwhich cuts and sneers--this aristocracy, though the aristocracy of the\r\nrevolution of July, is now too powerless in France to be more than\r\nvulgar in its pretensions. French manners, then, if they are not\r\ngracious, are at all events not insolent; while ours, unhappily,\r\ntestify on one hand the insolence, while they do not on the other\r\nrepresent the talent and the grace of that society which presided over\r\nthe later suppers of the old regime. We have no Monsieur de\r\nFitz-James, who might be rolled in a gutter all his life, as was said\r\nby a beautiful woman of his time, \"without ever contracting a spot of\r\ndirt.\" We have no Monsieur de Narbonne, who stops in the fiercest of a\r\nduel to pick up the ruffled rose that had slipped in a careless moment\r\nfrom his lips during the graceful conflict! You see no longer in\r\nFrance that noble air, that \"_great manner_,\" as it was called, by\r\nwhich the old nobility strove to keep up the distinction between\r\nthemselves and their worse-born associates to the last, and which of\r\ncourse those associates _assiduously imitated_.\r\n\r\nThat manner is gone: the French, so far from being a polite nation at\r\nthe present day, want that easiness of behavior which is the first\r\nessential to politeness. Every man you meet is occupied with\r\nmaintaining his dignity, and talks to you of _his_ position. There is\r\nan evident effort and struggle, I will not say to appear better than\r\nyou are, but to appear _all_ that _you are_, and to allow no person to\r\nthink that you consider him better than you. Persons, no longer\r\nranked by classes, take each by themselves an individual place in\r\nsociety. They are so many atoms, not forming a congruous or harmonious\r\nwhole. They are too apt to strut forward singly, and to say with a\r\ngreat deal of action, and a great deal of emphasis, \"I am--_nobody_.\"\r\nThe French are no longer polite, but in the French nation, as in every\r\nnation, there is an involuntary and traditionary respect which hallows\r\nwhat is gone-by; and among the marvels of modern France is a religion\r\nwhich ranks an agreeable smile and a graceful bow as essential virtues\r\nof its creed.\r\n\r\nNor does the Pere Enfantin stand alone. There is something touching in\r\nthe language of the old \"seigneur,\" who, placed as it were between two\r\nepochs, looking backwards and forwards to the graces of past times and\r\nthe virtues of new, thus expresses himself:\r\n\r\n\"Les progres de la lumiere et de la liberte ont certainment fait faire\r\nde grands pas a la raison humaine; mais aussi dans sa route,\r\nn'a-t-elle rien perdu? Moi qui ne suis pas un de ces opiniatres\r\nproneurs de ce bon vieux temp qui n'est plus, je ne puis m'empecher de\r\nregretter ce bon gout, cette grace, cette fleur d'enjouement et\r\nd'urbanite qui chassait de la societe tout ennui en permettant au bon\r\nsens de sourire et a la sagesse de se parer. Aujourd 'hui beaucoup de\r\ngens ressemblent a un proprietaire morose, qui, ne songeant qu'a\r\nl'utile, bannirait de son jardin les fleurs, et ne voudrait y voir que\r\ndu ble, des foins et des fruits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine.\r\n\r\nTHE LION IN THE TOILS.\r\n\r\nBY C. ASTOR BRISTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat followed the events related in our last number gave Ashburner a\r\nlesson against making up his mind too hastily on any points of\r\ncharacter, national or individual. A fortnight after his arrival at\r\nOldport he would have said that the Americans were the most\r\ncommunicative people he had ever fallen in with, and particularly,\r\nthat the men of \"our set\" were utterly incapable of keeping secret any\r\nact or purpose of their lives, any thing that had happened, or was\r\ngoing to happen. _Now_ he was surprised at the discretion shown by the\r\nmen cognizant of the late row (and they comprised all the fashionables\r\nleft in the place, and some of the outsiders, like Simpson); their\r\ndexterity and careful management, first, to prevent the affair from\r\ncoming to a fight, and then, if that were impossible, to keep it from\r\npublicity until the parties were safe over the border into Canada,\r\nwhere they might \"shoot each other like gentlemen,\" as a young\r\ngentleman from Alabama expressed it. Sedley himself, whose\r\nofficiousness had precipitated the quarrel, did all in his power to\r\nprevent any further mischief, and was as sedulous for the promotion of\r\n_silencio_ and _misterio_, as if he had been leader of a chorus of\r\nVenetian Senators. _The Sewer_ reporters, who, in their eagerness to\r\ncollect every bit of gossip and scandal, would have given the ears\r\nwhich an outraged community had permitted them to retain for a\r\nknowledge of the fracas and its probable consequences, never had the\r\nleast inkling of it. Indeed, so quietly was the whole managed, that\r\nAshburner never made out the cause of the old feud, nor was able to\r\nform any opinion on the probability of its final issue. On the former\r\npoint he could only come to the conclusion from what he heard, that\r\nHunter had been mythologizing, as his wont was, something to Benson's\r\ndiscredit several years before, and had been trying to make mischief\r\nbetween him and some of his friends or relations; but what the exact\r\noffence was, whether Sumner was involved in the quarrel from the\r\nfirst, and if so, to what extent; and whether the legend about the\r\nhorse was a part of, or only an addition to the original\r\ngrievance;--on these particulars he remained in the dark. As to the\r\nlatter, he knew that Hunter had not challenged Benson, and that he had\r\nleft the place, but whether to look up a friend or not, no one seemed\r\nto know, or if they did, no one cared to tell. At any rate, he did not\r\nreturn for a week and more, during which time Ashburner had full\r\nopportunity of studying the behavior and feelings of a man with a duel\r\nin prospect.\r\n\r\nThose who defend and advocate the practice of duelling, if asked to\r\nexplain the motives leading a gentleman to fight, would generally\r\nanswer somewhat to this effect: in the first place, personal courage\r\nwhich induces a man to despise danger and death, in comparison with\r\nany question affecting his own honor, or that of those connected with\r\nhim; secondly, a respect for the opinion of the society in which he\r\nmoves, which opinion, to a certain extent, supplies and fixes the\r\ndefinition of honor. Hence it would follow that, given a man who is\r\nneither physically brave, nor bound by any particular respect for the\r\nopinion of his daily associates, and the world he moves in, such a man\r\nwould not be likely to give or accept a challenge. The case under\r\nAshburner's observation afforded a palpable contradiction to this\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nHenry Benson was not personally valorous; what courage he possessed\r\nwas rather of a moral than a physical kind. Where he appeared to be\r\ndaring and heedless, it proved on examination to be the result of\r\nprevious knowledge and practice, which gave him confidence and armed\r\nhim with impunity. Thus he would drive his trotters at any thing, and\r\nshave through \"tight places\" on rough and crowded roads, his\r\nwhiffle-trees tipping and his hubs grazing the surrounding wheels in a\r\nway that at first made Ashburner shudder in spite of himself; but it\r\nwas because his experience in wagon-driving enabled him to measure\r\ndistances within half-an-inch, and to catch an available opening\r\nimmediately. On the other hand, in their pedestrian trips across\r\ncountry in Westchester, he was very chary of jumping fences or ditches\r\ntill he had ascertained by careful practice his exact capacity for\r\nthat sort of exercise. He would ride his black horse, Daredevil, who\r\nwas the terror of all the servants and women in his neighborhood,\r\nbecause he had made himself perfectly acquainted with all the animal's\r\nstock of tricks, and was fully prepared for them as they came; but he\r\nnever went the first trip in a new steamboat or railroad line. He ate\r\nand drank many things considered unhealthy, because he understood\r\nexactly from experience what and how much he could take without\r\ninjury; but you could not have bribed him to sit fifteen minutes in\r\nwet boots. In short, he was a man who took excellent care of himself,\r\n_canny_ as a Scot or a New-Englander, loving the good things of life,\r\nand not disposed to hazard them on slight grounds. Then as to the\r\napprobation or disapprobation of those about him, he was almost\r\nentirely careless of it. On any point beyond the cut of a coat, the\r\ndecoration of a room, the concoction of a dish, or the merits of a\r\nhorse, there were not ten people in his own set whose opinion he\r\nheeded. To the remarks of foreigners he was a little more sensitive,\r\nbut even these he was more apt to retort upon by a _tu quoque_ than to\r\nbe influenced by. Add to all this, that he had the convenient excuse\r\nof being a communicant at church, which, in America, implies something\r\nlike a formal profession of religion. Yet at this time he was not only\r\nwilling, but most eager to fight. The secret lay in his state of\r\nrecklessness. A moment of passion had overturned all his instincts,\r\nprinciples, and common-sense, and inspired him with the feverish\r\ndesire to pay off his old debts to Storey Hunter, at whatever cost.\r\nAnd as neither the possession of extraordinary personal courage, nor a\r\nhigh sense of conventional honor, nor a respect for the opinion of\r\nsociety, necessarily induces a feeling of recklessness, so neither\r\ndoes the absence of these qualities prevent the presence of this\r\nfeeling, exactly the most favorable one to make a man engage in a\r\nduel. Moralists have called such a condition one of temporary madness,\r\nand it has probably as good grounds to be classed with insanity as\r\nmany of the pleas known to medical and criminal jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, Ashburner had a good opportunity of observing--and\r\nthe example, it is to be hoped, was of service to him--the\r\ndemoralization induced upon a man by the mere impending possibility of\r\na duel. Benson seemed careless what he did. He danced frantically, and\r\ndrank so much at all hours, that the Englishman, though pretty\r\nstrong-headed himself, wondered how he could keep sober. He was openly\r\nseen reading _The Blackguard's Own_, a weekly of _The Sewer_ species.\r\nHe made up trotting-matches with every man in the place who owned a\r\n\"fast crab,\" and with some acquaintances at a distance, by\r\ncorrespondence. He kept studiously out of the way of his wife and\r\nchild, lest their influence might shake his determination. All this\r\ntime he practised pistol-shooting most religiously. Neither of the\r\nbelligerents had ever given a public proof of skill in this line.\r\nHunter's ability was not known, and Benson's shooting so uncertain and\r\nvariable when any one looked on, that those in the secret suspected\r\nhim of playing dark and disguising his hand. All which added to the\r\ninterest of the affair.\r\n\r\nBut when eleven days had passed without signs or tidings of Hunter,\r\nand it seemed pretty clear that he had gone away \"for good,\" Benson\r\nstarted up one morning, and went off himself to New-York, at the same\r\ntime with Harrison, whose brief and not very joyous holidays had come\r\nto a conclusion. He accompanied the banker, in accordance with the\r\ntrue American principle, always to have a lion for your companion when\r\nyou can; and as Harrison was still a man of note in Wall-street,\r\nhowever small might be his influence in his own household, Benson\r\nliked to be seen with him, and to talk any thing--even stocks--to him,\r\nthough he had no particular interest in the market at that time. But\r\nwhether an American is in business himself or not, the subject of\r\nbusiness is generally an interesting one to him, and he is always\r\nready to gossip about dollars. The unexampled material development of\r\nthe United States is only maintained by a condition of society which\r\nrequires every man to take a share in assisting that development, and\r\nthe most frivolous and apparently idle men are found sharp enough in\r\npecuniary matters. This trait of national character lies on the\r\nsurface, and foreigners have not been slow to notice it, and to\r\ndraw from it unfavorable conclusions. The supplementary and\r\ncounterbalancing features of character to be observed in these very\r\npeople,--that it is rather the fun of making the money than the money\r\nitself which they care for; that when it is made, they spend it\r\nfreely, and part with it more readily than they earned it; that they\r\nare more liberal both in their public and private charities\r\n(considering the amount of their wealth, and of the claims upon it)\r\nthan any nation in the world,--all these traits strangers have been\r\nless ready to dwell upon and do justice to.\r\n\r\nBenson was gone, and Ashburner stayed. Why? He had been at Oldport\r\nnearly a month; the place was not particularly beautiful, and the\r\nroutine of amusements not at all to his taste. Why did he stay? He had\r\nhis secret, too.\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy but indisputable fact, that even in the most\r\nreligious and moral country in the world, the bulwark of evangelical\r\nfaith, and the home of the domestic virtues (meaning, of course,\r\nEngland), a great many mothers who have daughters to marry, are not so\r\nanxious about the real welfare, temporal and eternal, of their young\r\nladies, as solicitous that they should acquire riches, titles, and\r\nother vanities of the world,--nay, that many of the daughters\r\nthemselves act as if their everlasting happiness depended on their\r\nsecuring in matrimony a proper combination of the aforesaid vanities,\r\nand put out of account altogether the greatest prize a woman can\r\ngain--the possession of a true and loving heart, joined to a wise\r\nhead. Now, Ashburner being a very good _parti_ at home, and having run\r\nthe gauntlet of one or two London seasons, had become very skittish of\r\nmammas, and still more so of daughters. He regarded the unmarried\r\nfemale as a most dangerous and altogether to be avoided animal, and\r\nwhen you offered to introduce him to a young lady, looked about as\r\ngrateful as if you had invited him to go up in a balloon. He expected\r\nto be rather more persecuted, if any thing, in America than he had\r\nbeen at home; and when he met Miss Vanderlyn at Ravenswood, if his\r\nfirst thought had found articulate expression, it would probably have\r\nbeen something like this:--\"Now that young woman is going to set her\r\ncap at me; what a bore it will be!\"\r\n\r\nNever was a man more mistaken in his anticipations. He encountered\r\nmany pretty girls, not at all timid, ready enough to talk, and flirty\r\nenough among their own set, but not one of them threw herself at him,\r\nand least of all did Miss Vanderlyn. Not that the young lady was the\r\nvictim of a romantic attachment, for she was perfectly fancy free and\r\nheart whole; nor, on the other hand, that she was at all insensible to\r\nthe advantages of matrimony, for she kept a very fair lookout in that\r\ndirection, and had, if not absolutely down on her books, at least\r\nengraved on the recording tablets of her mind, four distinct young\r\ngentlemen, combining the proper requisites, any of whom would suit her\r\npretty well, and one of whom--she didn't much care which--she was\r\npretty well resolved to marry within the next two years. And as she\r\nwas stylish and rather handsome, clever enough, and tolerably provided\r\nwith the root of all evil, besides having that fortunate good humor\r\nand accommodating disposition which go so far towards making a woman a\r\nbelle and a favorite, there was a sufficient probability that before\r\nthe expiration of that time, one of the four would offer himself. But\r\nall her calculations were founded on shrewd common sense; her\r\nimagination took no flights, and her aspirations only extended to the\r\nordinary and possible. That this young and strange Englishman,\r\ntravelling as a part of education, the son of a great man, and\r\nprobably betrothed by proxy to some great man's daughter, or going\r\ninto parliament to be a great man himself, and remain a bachelor for\r\nthe best part of his life,--that between him and herself there should\r\nby any thing in common, any point of union which could make even a\r\nflirtation feasible, never entered into her head. She would as soon\r\nhave expected the King of Dahomey to send an embassy with ostrich\r\nfeathers in their caps, and rings in their noses, formally to ask her\r\nhand in marriage. Nay, even if the incredible event had come to pass,\r\nand the young stranger had taken the initiative, even then she would\r\nnot by any means have jumped at the bait. For in the first place, she\r\nwas fully imbued with the idea that the Vanderlyns were quite as good\r\nas any other people in the world, and that (the ordinary conceit of an\r\nAmerican belle) to whatever man she might give her hand, all the honor\r\nwould come from her side, and all the gain be his; therefore she would\r\nnot have cared to come into a family who might suspect her of having\r\ninveigled their heir, and look down upon her as something beneath\r\nthem, because she came from a country where there were no noblemen.\r\nSecondly, there is a very general feeling among the best classes in\r\nAmerica, that no European worth any thing at home comes to America to\r\nget married. The idea is evidently an imperfect generalization, and\r\nliable to exceptions; but the prevalence of it shows more modesty in\r\nthe \"Upper Ten's\" appreciation of themselves than they usually have\r\ncredit for. As soon, therefore, as a foreigner begins to pay attention\r\nto a young lady in good society, it is _prima facie_ ground of\r\nsuspicion against him. The reader will see from all this how little\r\nchance there was of Ashburner's running any danger from the unmarried\r\nwomen about him. With the married ones the case was somewhat\r\ndifferent. It may be remembered, that at his first introduction to\r\nMrs. Henry Benson, the startling contrast she exhibited to the\r\nadulation he had been accustomed to receive, totally put him down; and\r\nthat afterwards she softened off the rough edge of her satire, and\r\nbecame very _piquante_ and pleasing to him. And as she greatly amused\r\nhim, so he began to suspect that she was rather proud of having such a\r\nlion in her train, as no doubt she was, notwithstanding the somewhat\r\nrough and cub-like stage of his existence. So he began to hang about\r\nher, and follow her around in his green awkward way, and look large\r\nnotes of admiration at her; and she was greatly diverted, and not at\r\nall displeased at his attentions. I don't know how far it might have\r\ngone; Ashburner was a very correct and moral young man, as the world\r\ngoes, but rather because he had generally business enough on hand to\r\nkeep him out of mischief, than from any high religious principle; and\r\nI am afraid that in spite of the claims of propriety, and honor, and\r\nfriendship, and the avenging Zeus of hospitality, and every other\r\nrestraining motive, he would have fallen very much in love with Mrs.\r\nBenson but for one thing.\r\n\r\nHe was hopelessly in love with Mrs. Harrison. How or when it began he\r\ncouldn't tell; but he found himself under the influence imperceptibly,\r\nas a man feels himself intoxicated. Sometimes he fancied that there\r\nhad been a kind of love at first sight--that with the first glimpse he\r\nhad of her, something in his heart told him that that woman was\r\ndestined to exert a mastery over him; yet his feelings must have\r\nundergone a change and growth, for he would not now have listened to\r\nany one speaking of her as Benson had done at that time. _Why_ it was,\r\nhe could still less divine. His was certainly not the blind\r\nadmiration which sees no fault in its idol; he saw her faults plainly\r\nenough, and yet could not help himself. He often asked himself how it\r\nhappened that if he _was_ doomed to endure an illicit and unfortunate\r\npassion, it was not for Mrs. Benson rather than Mrs. Harrison; for the\r\nformer was at least as clever, certainly handsomer, palpably younger,\r\nindubitably more lady-like, and altogether a higher style of woman.\r\nYet with this just appreciation of them, there was no comparison as to\r\nhis feelings towards the two. The one amused and delighted him when\r\npresent; the other, in her absence, was ever rising up before his\r\nmind's eye, and drawing him after her; and when they met, his\r\nheart beat quicker, and he was more than usually awkward and\r\nconfused.--Perhaps there had been, in the very origin of his\r\nentanglement and passion, some guiding impulse of honor, some sense\r\nthat Benson had been his friend and entertainer, and that to Harrison\r\nhe was under no personal obligations. For there are many shades of\r\nhonor and dishonor in dishonorable thoughts, and a little principle\r\ngoes a great way with some people, like the wind commemorated by Joe\r\nMiller's Irishman, of which there was not much, _but what there was,\r\nwas very high_.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, he was loving to perdition--or thought so, at\r\nleast; and it is hard to discriminate in a very young man's case\r\nbetween the conceit and the reality of love. His whole heart and mind\r\nwere taken up with one great, all-pervading idea of Mrs. Harrison, and\r\nhe was equally unable to smother and to express his flame. He was\r\ndying to make her a present of something, but he could send nothing\r\nwithout a fear of exciting suspicion, except bouquets; and of these\r\nfloral luxuries, though they were only to be procured at Oldport with\r\nmuch trouble and expense, she had always a supply from other quarters.\r\nHe did not like to be one of a number in his offerings; he wanted to\r\npay her some peculiar tribute. He would have liked to fight some man\r\nfor her, to pick a quarrel with some one who had said something\r\nagainst her. Proud and sensitive to ridicule as he was, he would have\r\nlaid himself down in her way, and let her walk over him, could he have\r\npersuaded himself that she would be gratified by such a proof of\r\ndevotion, and that it would help his cause with her.\r\n\r\nHad Benson been in Oldport now, there might have been trouble,\r\ninasmuch as he was not particular about what he said, and not too well\r\ndisposed towards Mrs. Harrison, while Ashburner was just in a state of\r\nmind to have fought with his own father on that theme. But Benson was\r\naway, and his absence at this time was not a source of regret to\r\nAshburner, who felt a little afraid of him, and with some reason, for\r\nour friend Harry was as observant as if he had a fly's allowance of\r\neyes, and had a knack of finding out things without looking for them,\r\nand of knowing things without asking about them; and he would\r\nassuredly have noticed that Ashburner began to be less closely\r\nattached to his party, and to follow in the train of Mrs. Harrison. As\r\nfor Clara Benson, she never troubled herself about the Englishman's\r\nfalling off in his attentions to her; if any thing, she was rather\r\nglad of it; her capricious disposition made her tire of a friend in a\r\nshort time; she could not endure any one's uninterrupted company--not\r\neven her husband's, who therefore wisely took care to absent himself\r\nfrom her several times every year.\r\n\r\nMoreover, though Ashburner was seen in attendance on the lioness, it\r\nwas not constantly or in a pointed manner. He was still fighting with\r\nhimself, and, like a man run away with, who has power to guide his\r\nhorse though not to stop him, he was so far able to manage his passion\r\nas to keep it from an open display. So absolutely no one suspected\r\nwhat was the matter with him, or that there was any thing the matter\r\nwith him, except the lady herself. Catch a woman not finding out when\r\na man is in love with her! Sometimes she may delude herself with\r\nimagining a passion where none exists, but she never makes the\r\nconverse mistake of failing to perceive it where it does. And how did\r\nthe gay Mrs. Harrison, knowing and perceiving herself to be thus\r\nloved, make use of her knowledge? What alteration did it produce in\r\nher conduct and bearing towards her admirer? Absolutely none at all.\r\nPrecisely as she had treated him at their first introduction did she\r\ncontinue to treat him--as if he were one of her everyday\r\nacquaintances, and nothing more. And it is precisely this line of\r\naction that utterly breaks down a man's defences, and makes him more\r\nhopelessly than ever the slave of his fair conqueror. If a woman\r\ndeclares open hostilities against him, runs him down behind his back,\r\nsnubs him to his face, shuns his society,--this at least shows that\r\nshe considers his attachment of some consequence--consequence enough\r\nto take notice of, though the notice be unfavorable. His self-respect\r\nmay come to the rescue, or his piqued vanity may save him by\r\nconverting love into enmity. But a perseverance in never noticing his\r\nlove, and feigning to be ignorant of its existence, completely\r\nestablishes her supremacy over him.\r\n\r\nA Frenchman, who has conceived designs against a married lady, only\r\nseeks to throw dust in the husband's eyes, and then if he cannot\r\nsucceed in his final object, at least to establish sufficient intimacy\r\nto give him a plausible pretext for saying that he has succeeded; for\r\nin such a matter he is not scrupulous about lying a little--or a great\r\ndeal. An American, bad enough for a similar intention (which usually\r\npresupposes a considerable amount of _Parisianization_), acts as much\r\nlike a Frenchman--if anything, rather worse. An Englishman is not\r\nusually moved to the desire of an intrigue by vanity, but driven into\r\nit by sheer passion, and his first impulse is to run bodily off with\r\nthe object of his misplaced affection; to take her and himself out of\r\nthe country, as if he could thereby travel out of his moral\r\nresponsibilities. Reader, did you ever notice, or having noticed, did\r\nyou ever ponder upon the geographical distribution of morals and\r\npropriety which is so marked and almost peculiar a feature of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon mind? In certain outward looks and habits, the English may\r\nbe unchangeable and unmistakeable all over the globe; but their\r\nethical code is certainly not the same at home and abroad. It is\r\npretty much so with an American, too, before he has become irreparably\r\nParisianized. When he puts on his travelling habits, he takes off his\r\npuritan habits, and makes light of doing things abroad which he would\r\nbe the first to anathematize at home. Observe, we are not speaking of\r\nthe deeply religious, nor yet of the openly profligate class in either\r\ncountry, but of the general run of respectable men who travel; they\r\nregard a great part of their morality and their manners as intended\r\nsolely for home consumption; while a Frenchman or a German, if his\r\nhome standard is not so high, lives better up to it abroad. And yet\r\nmany Englishmen, and some Americans, wonder why their countrymen are\r\nso unpopular as foreign travellers!\r\n\r\nAshburner, then, wanted to run away with Mrs. Harrison. How he could\r\nhave supported her never entered into his thoughts, nor did he\r\nconsider what the effect would be on his own prospects. He did not\r\nreflect, either, how miserably selfish it was in him, after all, to\r\nexpect that this woman would give up her fortune and position, her\r\nchildren, her unbounded legitimate domination over her husband, for\r\nhis boyish passion, and how infinitesimally small the probability that\r\nshe would do so crazy a thing. Nor did Harrison ever arise before his\r\nmind as a present obstacle or future danger; and this was less frantic\r\nthan most of his overlookings. The broker was a strong and courageous\r\nman, and probably had been once very much in love with his wife; but\r\nat that time, so far from putting a straw in the way of any man who\r\nwanted to relieve him of her, he would probably have been willing to\r\npay his expenses into the bargain.\r\n\r\nBut how to declare his passion--that was the question. He saw that the\r\ninitiatory steps, and very decided ones, must be taken on his part;\r\nand it was not easy to find the lady alone ten minutes together.\r\nPeople lived at Newport as if they were in the open air, and the\r\nvolunteer police of ordinary gossip made private interviews between\r\nwell-known people a matter of extreme difficulty. A Frenchman\r\nsimilarly placed would have brought the affair to a crisis much\r\nsooner: he would have found a thousand ways of disclosing his\r\nfeelings, and at the same time dexterously leaving himself a loop-hole\r\nof escape. Very clever at these things are the Gauls; they will make\r\nan avowal in full ball-room, under cover of the music, if there is no\r\nother chance to be had. But tact in love affairs is not a\r\ncharacteristic of the Englishman, especially at Ashburner's age. He\r\nhad none of this mischievous dexterity; perhaps it is just as well\r\nwhen a man has not, both for himself and for society. He thought of\r\nwriting, and actually began many letters or notes, or billet-doux, or\r\nwhatever they might be called; but they always seemed so absurd (as\r\ntruly they were), that he invariably tore them up when half-finished.\r\nHe thought of serving up his flame in verse (for about this time the\r\nunhappy youth wrote many verses, which on his return to sanity he very\r\nwisely made away with); but his emotion lay too deep for verse, and\r\nhis performances seemed even to himself too ridiculous for him to\r\ndream of presenting them. Still he must make a beginning somehow; he\r\ncould not ask her to run away with him apropos of nothing.\r\n\r\nOne of his great anxieties, you may be sure, was to find out if any\r\nother man stood in his way, and who that man might be. His first\r\nimpulses were to be indiscriminately jealous of every man he saw\r\ntalking or walking with her; but on studying out alone the result of\r\nhis observations, he could not discover that she affected any one man\r\nmore than another. For this was one of her happy arts, that she made\r\nherself attractive to all without showing a marked preference for any\r\none. White, who among his other accomplishments had a knack of quoting\r\nthe standard poets, compared her to Pope's Belinda--saying, that her\r\nlively looks disclosed a sprightly mind, and that she extended smiles\r\nto all, and favors to none. So that Ashburner's jealousy could find no\r\nfixed object to light on. At one time he had been terribly afraid of\r\nLe Roi, chiefly from having heard the lady praise him for his\r\naccomplishments and agreeable manners. But once he heard Sedley say,\r\nthat Mrs. Harrison had been worrying Le Roi half out of his wits, and\r\nquite out of his temper.\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she was praising you, and saying how much she liked the English\r\ncharacter, and how true and honest your countrymen were--so much more\r\nto be depended on than the French--and more manly, too; and altogether\r\nshe worked him up into such a rage against _ces insulaires_, that he\r\nwent off ready to swear.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then Ashburner suspected what he afterwards became certain\r\nof--that this was only one of the pleasant little ways the woman had\r\nof amusing herself. Whenever she found two men who were enemies, or\r\nrivals, or antagonists in any way, she would praise each to the other,\r\non purpose to aggravate them: and very successful she was in her\r\npurpose; for she had the greatest appearance of sincerity, and\r\nwhatever she said seemed to come right out of her heart. But if any\r\nlingering fears of Le Roi still haunted the Englishman's mind, they\r\nwere dispelled by his departure along with the main body of the\r\nexclusives. Though always proud to be seen in the company of a\r\nconspicuous character like Mrs. Harrison, the Vicomte more\r\nparticularly cultivated the fashionables proper, and gladly embraced\r\nthe opportunity of following, in the train of the Robinsons.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, after all, Ashburner would have preferred being able to\r\nconcentrate his suspicions upon one definite person, to feeling a\r\nvague distrust of somebody he knew not whom, especially as the\r\npresence of a rival might have brought the affair to a crisis sooner.\r\nTo a crisis it was approaching, nevertheless, for his passion now\r\nbegan to tell on him. He looked pale, and grew nervous and weak--lay\r\nawake at nights, which he had never done before, except when going in\r\nfor the Tripos at Cambridge--and was positively off his feed, which he\r\nhad never been at any previous period of his life. He thought of\r\ntearing himself away from the place--the wisest course, doubtless;\r\nbut, just as he had made up his mind to go by the next stage, Mrs.\r\nHarrison, as if she divined what he was about, would upset all his\r\nplans by a few words, or a look or smile--some little expression which\r\nmeant nothing, and could never be used against her; but which, by a\r\nman in his state, might be interpreted to mean a great deal.\r\n\r\nOne morning the crisis came--not that there was any particular reason\r\nfor it then more than at any other time, only he could hold out no\r\nlonger. It was a beautiful day, and they had been strolling in one of\r\nthe few endurable walks the place afforded--a winding alley near the\r\nhotel, but shrouded in trees, and it was just at the time when most of\r\nthe inhabitants were at ten-pins, so that they were tolerably alone.\r\nNow, if ever, was the time; but the more he tried to introduce the\r\nsubject, the less possible he found it to make a beginning, and all\r\nthe while he could not avoid a dim suspicion that Mrs. Harrison knew\r\nperfectly well what he was trying to drive at, and took a mischievous\r\npleasure in saying nothing to help him along. So they talked about his\r\ntravels and hers, and great people in England and France, and all\r\nsorts of people then at Oldport, and the weather even--all manner of\r\nordinary topics; and then they walked some time without saying\r\nanything, and then they went back to the hotel. There he felt as if\r\nhis last chance was slipping away from him, and in a sudden fit of\r\ndesperate courage he followed her up to her parlor without waiting for\r\nan invitation. Hardly was the door closed--he would have given the\r\nworld to have locked it--when he begged her to listen to him a few\r\nminutes on a subject of the greatest importance. The lady opened her\r\nlarge round eyes a little wider; it was the only sign she gave of any\r\nthing approaching to surprise. Then the young man unbosomed himself\r\njust as he stood there--not upon his knees; people used to do that--in\r\nbooks, at least--but nobody does now. He told her how long he had been\r\nin love with her--how he thought of her all day and all night, and how\r\nwretched he was--how he had tried to subdue his passion, knowing it\r\nwas very wrong, and so forth; but really he couldn't help it,\r\nand--and--there he stuck fast; for all the time he had been making\r\nthis incoherent avowal, like one in a dream, hardly knowing what he\r\nwas about, but conscious only of taking a decisive step, and doing a\r\nvery serious thing in a very wild way--all this time, nevertheless, he\r\nhad most closely watched Mrs. Harrison, to anticipate his sentence in\r\nsome look or gesture of hers. And he saw that there did not move a\r\nline in her face, or a muscle in her whole figure--not a fibre of her\r\ndress even stirred. If she had been a great block of white marble, she\r\ncould not have shown less feeling, as she stood up there right\r\nopposite him. If he had asked her to choose a waistcoat pattern for\r\nhim, she could not have heard him more quietly. As soon as he had\r\nfairly paused, so that she could speak without immediate interruption,\r\nshe took up the reply. It was better that he should go no further, as\r\nshe had already understood quite enough. She was very sorry to give\r\nhim pain--it was always unpleasant to give pain to any one. She was\r\nalso very sorry that he had so deceived himself, and so misapprehended\r\nher character, or misunderstood her conversation. He was very young\r\nyet, and had sense enough to get over this very soon. Of course, she\r\nwould never hear any repetition of such language from him; and, on her\r\npart, she would never mention what had occurred to any one--especially\r\nnot to Mr. Harrison (it was the first time he had ever heard her\r\nallude to the existence of that gentleman); and then she wound up with\r\na look which said as plainly as the words could have done, \"Now, you\r\nmay go.\"\r\n\r\nAshburner moved off in a more than usual state of confusion. As he\r\napproached the door it opened suddenly, and he nearly walked over one\r\nof the little Bleeckers, a flourishing specimen of Young New-York,\r\nwith about three yards of green satin round his throat, and both his\r\nhands full of French novels, which he had been commissioned to bring\r\nfrom the circulating library. Ashburner felt like choking him, and it\r\nwas only by a great effort that he contrived to pass him with a barely\r\ncivil species of nod. But as he went out, he could not refrain from\r\ncasting one glance back at Mrs. Harrison. She had taken off her bonnet\r\n(which in America is denominated a hat), and was tranquilly arranging\r\nher hair at the glass.\r\n\r\nSomehow or other he found his way down stairs, and rushed off into the\r\ncountry on a tearing walk, enraged and disgusted with every thing, and\r\nwith himself most of all. When a man has made up his mind to commit a\r\nsin, and then has been disappointed in the fruition of it--when he has\r\nsold the birthright of his integrity, without getting the miserable\r\nmess of pottage for it which he expected, his feelings are not the\r\nmost enviable. Ashburner was angry enough to marry the first heiress\r\nhe met with. First, he half resolved to get up a desperate flirtation\r\nwith Mrs. Benson; but the success of his first attempt was not\r\nencouraging to the prosecution of a second. To kill himself was not in\r\nhis line; but he felt very like killing some one else. He still\r\nfeared he might have been made a screen for some other man. But if the\r\nother man existed, he could only be reached by fighting successively\r\nall the single men of \"our set,\" and a fair sprinkling of those in the\r\nsecond set. Then he thought he must at least leave the place, but his\r\npride still revolted at the idea of running away before a woman.\r\nFinally, after walking about ten miles, and losing his dinner, he\r\nsobered down gradually, and thought what a fool he had been; and the\r\nissue of his cogitations was a very wise double conclusion. He formed\r\na higher opinion of the virtue of American women, and he never\r\nattempted any experiments on another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Sharpe's London Magazine.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN OF TACT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no distinctive term more frequently employed, and less\r\ngenerally understood, than the word \"Tact.\" It is in every one's\r\nmouth, and many have a vague notion of its meaning, who yet, if\r\nrequired, would find no slight difficulty in giving its definition. It\r\nis the application of perceptive common-sense to life's practical\r\ndetails; the correct adaptation of means to ends, from an intuitive\r\nknowledge of character, blended with a careful concealment, a discreet\r\nevasion of our own, except when amiable faults are avowed, to enhance\r\nthe impression of our candor. Cameleon-like, \"tact\" assumes the color\r\nof contingent circumstances,--is the vague, yet potent spirit, with\r\nits shadowless finger arresting the impulses; an unseen ruler of the\r\nthoughts, winding its gossamer yet adamantine meshes like a spell; the\r\nuncaught \"hic et ubique\" arbiter of mortal destinies embodied in a\r\nfellow-mortal.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of the \"man of tact,\" as of one in whom this quality\r\npredominates,--as hereafter we shall speak of the man of honor, of\r\ngenius, and of sense, we must confess that above most other\r\ncharacteristics, this is especially absorbent in its influence, and\r\ngenerally usurps the government of the whole man. It collects into its\r\nown stream the channels of other motives, which it renders tributary,\r\nuntil it pervades the whole moral surface with one obliterating\r\ndeluge. If not watched, it will hence induce a general deceptiveness,\r\nfor the other impulses will partake of its color, shrewdness will\r\nbecome cunning, discretion will change into artful dexterity. Its very\r\nprogress is sinuous and oblique, never more so than when assuming the\r\nguise of straightforwardness and truth; but if divested of its baser\r\nelements, it will soar into the higher intellectuals, and will claim\r\naffinity to practical observation, or, to speak phrenologically, to\r\ncausality. In this view it combines with prudence, also with\r\nself-discipline, in the regulation of the temper; in fact, is the\r\nchild of judgment, inheriting with its parent's calmness somewhat of\r\nher coldness too.\r\n\r\nObserve that man sitting in the private room of one of our largest\r\nmercantile establishments. Risen from a low grade to the direction of\r\na vast concern, at one time intrusted with a mission abroad of a most\r\nimportant yet delicate character, he owes the eminence he has attained\r\nentirely to tact. The features are now in repose, take your\r\nopportunity to watch them (for they are seldom so, and if he were\r\naware of observation, would assume a different expression); how the\r\nwear upon nerves, even of such flexibility, imparts to the fatigued\r\ncountenance an air of study, ceaseless even in comparative inaction.\r\nThe open and bald forehead, clear, expansive, impending over deep-set,\r\nsmall, yet fathomless eyes, restless and anxious in their motion; the\r\nlips fullish, wearing at the corner a half-contemptuous yet\r\ngood-humored self-contentment, which tells of the owner's disdain for\r\nthe game of life, and yet of triumphant complacency at his own\r\nsuccessful skill in it. He smiles! Ah! he is thinking of how he\r\ndeluded that shallow fop, Lord F----, whom fortune raised kindly to\r\nconceal his puerilites by a coronet; or perhaps (as his eye dilates\r\nwith haughtier gaze) he dreams of having struck a nobler quarry, when\r\nhe outwitted the subtle Count de P----; for neither thought they were\r\nfollowing aught but the suggestion of their own will. This is the\r\nmystery and mastery of tact. Had his victims seen that smile, the game\r\nwould have been lost; but he was different to each, the man was\r\nchanged. The lordling saw before him a free hearty abettor of youthful\r\nfolly, an Apicius, not a Mentor, one versed in life's vanities, yet\r\nstill ready to quaff the draught he satirized; sagacious in\r\ncriticising pleasure, yet reckless as the youngest in its pursuit; but\r\nto the Count, the deferential air, the silent evidence of every\r\naction, so sedulously courteous, yet so artless, attesting the\r\nlistener's (for he spoke but to inquire as if of an oracle, and\r\ndemurred but to render conviction more gracefully attractive)\r\nreverence for the old diplomatist's sagacity; the rejoinder\r\ndexterously introduced to confirm confidence in his visitor that he\r\nwas not wasting his instruction,--these and the thousand nameless\r\npoints of tact, dipped in the fountain of his own deep counsel,\r\ninstilled the wary practiser's motives into the mind of one,\r\napparently his confessed master in the art of diplomacy, convinced the\r\nCount that he was regarded as the condensation of profound thought, of\r\nastute sagacity; and it so happened, that if there was one\r\nqualification in which the foreigner especially exulted more than any\r\nother, it was upon his dexterity in deciphering disposition--in his\r\nthorough knowledge of human nature!\r\n\r\nWe have said he was an adept in listening: indeed it was averred that\r\nhe obtained a large estate by the quiet attention with which he\r\nlistened to the toothless twaddle of a senile Dowager--age's\r\ngarrulity--the echo of an empty hall which thought has quitted. He\r\nrarely, however, in any case interrupts the driest drawler, for he\r\nhas tutored attendants who understand not only whom to admit, but also\r\na hint as to the proper duration of a conference, and these with ready\r\nmessage cut short the intruder's dull delay. If, also, in public or\r\nprivate he be himself interrupted, he never loses his temper or the\r\npoint; resumes the thread just where it was broken, and with polite,\r\nyet unswerving pertinacity, directs the minds of all to the wished-for\r\nend, in spite of every purposed or involuntary attempt to distract\r\nthem into devious channels. Some men, like jackdaws, proclaim with\r\nnoisy loquaciousness their most private matters, alarming the public\r\nhorizon with egotistical chatter about their own nests: \"tact,\" as the\r\nmaster of it, Cromwell, knew, acknowledges the \"safety of silence,\"\r\nand like the rat,--a subtle politician!--saps vast fabrics by an\r\ninsidious, unheard gnawing underground!\r\n\r\nBriefly, this man listens much, speaks little--mostly the latter when\r\nhe would conceal his thoughts--keeps his eyes and ears open, his mouth\r\nand his heart closed. With numerous admirers, he has many enemies--the\r\nlatter's hostility is however repressed by fear, and the regard of the\r\nother, somehow, never ripens into love; it may be that selfishness,\r\nthe concomitant of tact, forbids affection. We have shown the fair\r\nside of the portrait hitherto drawn from the respectable sphere (as it\r\nis called) of life; but it has its evil counterpart or reverse to be\r\nseen in a notorious receiver of stolen property, ever watched by, yet\r\never baffling the police,--one, who, having helped many to the hulks,\r\nhas by sheer cunning (tact in motley!) himself escaped. The\r\nconsciences of both are similarly guided by the law of public not\r\nprivate morality--interest is the ruling principle of both; even the\r\ndrudgery of each assimilates, for a life of dissimulation is a very\r\nhard one. What actor would be _always_ on the stage? Both are\r\ncommercial men in a sense, though one lives at the west-end, the other\r\nnear Seven-dials; sometimes they meet,--the rich, upon--the poor,\r\nbefore, the bench--\"the Justice\" in silk \"frowns\" on the speciously\r\n\"simple thief\" in rags; yet nature has cut the countenances of both\r\nfrom the same piece, and true it is that her \"one touch,\" the\r\nprevalence of tact, successful here,--in hard confronting\r\nthere--renders both \"akin.\"\r\n\r\nYet not always does \"tact\" array itself in silken softness, or \"stoop\r\nto conquer:\" some ply the trade with no less success under the guise\r\nof rough and candid honesty: these men declare loudly that they always\r\nspeak their minds: come upon us with a bluff sincerity, disarming\r\nprudence by an appearance of incautious trust and open-heartedness.\r\nThey \"cannot cog,\" they cannot sue, they profess noisily to abhor\r\n\"humbug,\" as they term it, in every shape:--a strange ingratitude _to\r\nwhat they chiefly thrive by_; for certain it is, that though\r\ndoubtlessly \"all honorable men,\" these are the most insidious\r\ntacticians, and generally of the worst kind.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have spoken of \"tact\" in its deteriorated shape, and\r\nindeed the word seems to have got so bad a name that its bare mention\r\nbreathes distrust. Yet there is a medium class of men who, like\r\nWilliam of Orange, reduce violent feelings even to frigidity, and\r\nallowing discretion her widest scope, do not entirely obliterate the\r\naffections. Machiavelli says that \"seldom men of mean fortunes attain\r\nto high degrees without force or fraud, and generally rather by the\r\nlatter than the former,\" and hence he recommends guile to be\r\nadopted--but these, to whom we now allude, practise prudence, yet\r\npreserve their guileless sincerity. Here, though the term is rather\r\nunivocal, and seems to apply only to our concerns with others, its\r\nhealthy action is forcibly evinced on the individual's mind, for it\r\ndisciplines the impulses and reviews for ready co-action reason's\r\npowers. So high did the ancients in their sense regard it, that they\r\nelevated it to a divinity--\"Nullum numen adest si sit Prudentia,\"\r\nthough, as Addison observes, \"this sort of discretion has no place in\r\nprivate conversation between intimate friends. It occupies a neutral\r\nground between caution and art, uses expediency instead of integrity,\r\nand hence deceives us by the first, when we look for the consistency\r\nof the latter.\" Almost ever combined with conceit (the pride of\r\nquestionable success), it never possesses the magnanimity to confess\r\nan error; for this detracting from its arrogated infallibility might\r\ndeteriorate its influence: it will acknowledge vices (if polite), but\r\nwill never plead guilty to mistakes, since the grossest charge against\r\nthe \"man of tact\" at the bar of self, much more of public judgment, is\r\nnot the perpetration of a sin--but the commission of a blunder!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the \"Revue des Deux Mondes.\"\r\n\r\nA WRECK OF THE OLD FRENCH ARISTOCRACY.\r\n\r\nAN INCIDENT OF TRAVEL IN THE LIMOUSIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is truly a great mistake to measure the interest of a journey by\r\nits duration, and that of a country by its remoteness; and one is\r\ndeceived in supposing that it is necessary to go afar in quest of\r\nadventures, and make a voyage two years long in order to see curious\r\nsights. There is a certain author who has made \"a journey around his\r\nroom\" more fruitful in incidents of all descriptions than the\r\nnumberless voyages of an infinity of sailors that I know; and one may\r\nmake, thank heaven! many an interesting trip without passing beyond\r\nthe \"neighboring shores\" from which La Fontaine forbids us to wander.\r\nThe only thing is, that it is less easy to travel after this fashion\r\nthan the other, and that it requires a lengthened preparation.\r\n\r\nIn order to observe skilfully, one must be accustomed to look around\r\none. We scarcely become curious except after long habit, and, strange\r\nto say, our curiosity seems to increase in proportion as we satisfy\r\nit. When we know a great deal we desire to know still more, and it is\r\nremarkable that those alone desire to see no sights who have never had\r\nany sights to see. Moreover, it is necessary to have contemplated the\r\ngrandest spectacles of nature in order to understand and love her\r\nleast conspicuous wonders; for nature does not surrender herself to\r\nthe first comer. She is a chaste and severe divinity, who admits to\r\nher intimacy those alone who have deserved it by long contemplations\r\nand a constant worship: and I firmly believe that it is necessary to\r\nhave travelled round the world in order profitably and agreeably to\r\nmake the tour of one's garden. If many years of youth spent in\r\nwandering by land and sea, can render me an authority in regard to\r\ntravels, then am I justified in declaring, that in none of my more\r\ndistant courses have I found more interest and pleasure than in the\r\nlittle trip I am now about to narrate.\r\n\r\nThere were, then, four of us, all alike young, gay, active, clad in\r\nshooting costume, going straight ahead, without fixed plan or\r\npreconcerted itinerary, marching at hap-hazard in these desert\r\n_landes_, respiring freely the pungent odor of the broom, roaming from\r\nhill to hill without other rallying point than the top of a mountain\r\nwhich pointed out the direction of the low lands. After four hours'\r\nwalk we discovered that this mountain was still very far distant, and\r\nthat the sun was sinking below the horizon. We had already left behind\r\nus the wildest part of the department of the _Correze_. To woods of\r\npine and birch succeeded enormous chestnut-trees; the sterile heath\r\ngave place to cultivated fields. Here and there some houses displayed\r\ntheir straw-colored roofs, and some scattered laborers beheld us pass\r\nby with gaping suspicion. To tell the truth, we had all of us a\r\ntolerably gallows look. In this wretched country, where every one\r\nlives on from day to day without quitting his little inclosure,\r\nwithout even hearing an echo from afar, four bearded marauders like\r\nourselves, avoiding the beaten road, and marching rapidly across\r\nstubble and thicket, presented no ordinary rencontre. All on a sudden\r\nthe clouds began to gather, and, by way of varying our sensations, a\r\nterrific tempest burst over our heads. It was the first incident of\r\nour journey. Drenched through in a moment by this diluvian rain, we\r\nrushed, with the ardor of soldiers mounting a breach, towards a\r\nvillage perched like a magpie's nest on the summit of the hill we were\r\nascending. A house of capacious size, but of dismal and ruinous\r\nappearance, arose before us. We rushed in at a charging pace, and\r\nfound that it was deserted, except that near the hearth, where\r\nsmouldered the embers of the most miserable fire in the world, an\r\ninfant was deposited in, or rather tied to, his cradle, according to\r\nthe fashion of the country. By the aid of a stout bandage they had\r\nswaddled him up like a mummy, and duly sealed him to the planks of the\r\nlittle box, which served him for a bed. In addition, his head was\r\ncarefully turned toward the fire, so that his cranium was in a state\r\nof continual ebullition, such being the appointed regimen of the\r\nneighborhood. At the sight of our strange visages, the little one,\r\nafter staring at us for a moment or two, proceeded to utter the most\r\nlamentable outcries. I rocked his cradle with the most paternal\r\nsolicitude, but could not succeed in quieting him. On the contrary,\r\nhis screams became positively heart-rending, and we were almost ready\r\nto smother him outright in order to put a stop to his roaring. At this\r\nsummons a woman entered abruptly into the house, and stared at us with\r\nan expression of alarm. It was incumbent on us to explain that we were\r\nno pilferers, and this was no easy matter. The young mother evidently\r\nlooked on us with suspicion. She was not altogether a mere\r\npeasant,--at least she wore, instead of the little straw hat trimmed\r\nwith black velvet, which is the ordinary head-dress of the\r\ncountrywomen, a bonnet, which in the Limousin is a certain indication\r\nof pretensions to the rank of the _bourgeoise_. Her robe, besides,\r\nhowever inelegant it might be, was nevertheless town-made.\r\n\r\nThese matters I noticed at a glance, whilst one of my companions gave\r\nthe needful explanations as to our pacific intentions. Our hostess\r\npretended to be satisfied. She removed the cradle, threw some shavings\r\ninto the fire to revive it, and sat herself down with a cold,\r\nconstrained manner, in which I could discover at once considerable\r\nembarrassment, accompanied by a certain air of dignity. Never had I\r\nseen a Limousin peasant take a seat in the presence of _gentlemen_,\r\nand I speedily made another discovery which not a little perplexed me.\r\nThe fire as it revived had thrown a glow upon the hearthstone, which\r\nwas of cast-iron, and presented a large armorial escutcheon. This\r\ndisplay astonished me. I looked round again at the smoke-dried kitchen\r\nin which we sat; it was a miserable place. The ceiling was falling\r\npiecemeal; in the pavement, disjointed and worn, were three or four\r\nmuddy holes but rarely cleared out, the dampness of which was kept up\r\nby the continual dripping of a dozen cream cheeses, suspended in a\r\nlong basket of osiers. Two beds, a large table, and a few dilapidated\r\nchairs, composed the furniture of the apartment, which was pervaded by\r\na sour and offensive smell, apparently very attractive to a huge sow\r\nwhose grunting snout was ever and anon thrust into the entrance of the\r\ndoorway. Whence, then, this curious hearthstone? I looked more\r\nattentively at the young woman, and discovered in her countenance a\r\ncertain air of distinction. I then inquired of her at what place we\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur is jesting at me, doubtless,\" she pretty sharply replied.\r\n\r\nI assured her I had no such intention, and was really ignorant of the\r\nname of the village.\r\n\r\n\"It is not a village, sir,\" she resumed, \"it is a town. You are at the\r\nPuy d'Arnac, in the Canton of Beaulieu.\"\r\n\r\nA native of Marseilles would hardly have named the _Canebiere_ with\r\ngreater satisfaction. I knew that the Puy d'Arnac gave its name to a\r\ncelebrated growth of the _Correze_, and I thought I understood the\r\nlofty tone of the reply. All on a sudden, one of my companions, whom\r\nwe nicknamed the \"Broker,\" because he groped into all sorts of places,\r\nand, with amusing perseverance, hunted out objects of art and\r\ncuriosity even in hovels, touched my elbow, and asked me if I had\r\nnoticed the picture which was half-hidden under the serge curtains of\r\none of the beds. I had not yet observed it, and got up to look at it.\r\nIt was the portrait of a general officer of the time of Louis XV. The\r\nframe, sculptured and gilt, struck me still more, being really\r\nbeautiful. \"This is a discovery indeed,\" said my friend to me, while I\r\ninquired of the young woman where such a portrait could have come\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n\"Where could it have come from, Monsieur?\" she haughtily replied; \"it\r\nis the portrait of my grandfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" we exclaimed, all four of us, turning ourselves round with\r\nsurprise. With one hand our hostess stirred the fire, with an\r\nindifference evidently affected, while with the other she rocked the\r\nlittle box in which her infant was asleep.\r\n\r\n\"Might I presume to inquire the name of Monsieur your grandfather?\"\r\nsaid I, drawing near to her.\r\n\r\n\"He was the Count of Anteroches,\" was her reply.\r\n\r\n\"What, the Count of Anteroches, who commanded the French guards at the\r\nbattle of Fontenoy?\"[5]\r\n\r\n\"You have heard him spoken of, then?\" resumed the peasant girl, with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nMy friend the Broker stood as if stupefied before the picture. All of\r\na sudden he wheeled round, and, gravely removing his cap, repeated\r\nwith a theatrical air the celebrated saying of M. d'Anteroches,--\"Fire\r\nfirst, _Messieurs les Anglais_; we are Frenchmen, and must do you the\r\nhonors!\"\r\n\r\nThis anecdote is, to my thinking, the most charming and most\r\nthoroughly stamped with the image of the age of any recorded in\r\nhistory. With regard to these celebrated sayings uttered in battles, I\r\nmust indeed confess that I am very skeptical. Little as I may be of a\r\nsoldier, I have a notion that it is not in an engagement as at the\r\nOlympic Circus, and that in the midst of fire, smoke, and musketry,\r\ngenerals must have other work on their hands than to utter these\r\npretty epigrams, which there is moreover no shorthand writer at hand\r\nto take down. I know that Cambronne was annoyed when they recalled to\r\nhim his splendid exclamation at Waterloo, \"_La garde meurt et ne se\r\nrend pas!_\" (The guard dies, and does not surrender!) \"an invention\r\nthe more clumsy,\" said he, \"that I am not yet dead, and that I really\r\ndid surrender.\" I have even discovered that this saying was invented\r\nby a member of the Institute, for the greater satisfaction of the\r\nreaders of the \"Yellow Dwarf,\" in which he wrote, in 1815, together\r\nwith Benjamin Constant and many other celebrated malcontents.[6] The\r\nspeeches of Leonidas find me equally incredulous. But, wheresoever\r\nthey may come from, I delight in these anecdotes, which personify an\r\nentire epoch, and engrave it upon the memory with a single stroke. We\r\nmay defy the historian who seeks to characterize the end of the last\r\ncentury and the beginning of the present, to find two epigrams more\r\nstriking than the words attributed to Anteroches and Cambronne--to two\r\nFrench officers--one commanding the French guards, the other the old\r\nguard; both fighting for their country, at an interval of seventy\r\nyears, with the same enemy, and on the same ground: for it is a\r\nsingular coincidence that Fontenoy and Waterloo are but little distant\r\nfrom each other, and Heaven saw fit to ordain that the game of success\r\nand reverse should be played out almost upon the same fields. \"Fire\r\nfirst, _Messieurs les Anglais_!\" Is it not the type of that easy and\r\nadorable, that ironical and _blase_ nobility, who pushed the contempt\r\nof life even to insanity, and the worship of courtesy and honor even\r\nto the sublime?--who endowed their country with such a renown for\r\nelegance, high-breeding, and gallantry, that all its demagogic\r\nsaturnalia never have effaced it, and never will?--a nobility\r\nreckless, if you please, but assuredly charming, and perfectly French\r\nwithal, who gayly passed through life without ever doing the morrow\r\nthe honor of thinking about it, and who, beholding one day the earth\r\ngive way beneath their feet, looked into the abyss without a wink,\r\nwithout alarming themselves, without belying themselves, and went down\r\nalive and whole into the gulf, disdaining all defence, \"without fear,\"\r\nif not \"without reproach.\"\r\n\r\nBetween the saying of Anteroches and that of Cambronne there is a\r\ngreat gap; we find that the revolution has passed through it. The\r\ngentleman, refined even to exaggeration, has disappeared, and we have\r\ninstead the rude language of democracy--\"_La garde meurt et ne se rend\r\npas_\"--this is heroism, no doubt, but heroism of another sort. Never\r\ndid the _chauvinism_ of this present time light upon a more cornelian\r\ndevice, but do you not see in it the theatrical affectation, the\r\nmelo-dramatic emphasis of another race? That he had no fear of death,\r\nand no idea of surrendering--this is what the gentleman of Fontenoy\r\nhad no intention of declaring; it ought to have been well known--his\r\nfollowers had already given proof of it for ages past. To be brave\r\nalone to him was nothing--he must be as elegant in battle as he was at\r\nthe ball. What signified death to that incomparable race who\r\nafterwards composed madrigals in prison, and ascended the scaffold\r\nwith a smile, their step elastic, and their hand in the waistcoat\r\npocket, a cocked hat under their arm, and a rose-bud between their\r\nlips? This epoch was personified in my eyes by the handsome and gentle\r\ncountenance of the Count of Anteroches. After more than a hundred\r\nyears I had discovered by chance, myself, an obscure wayfarer, in an\r\nunknown and miserable cabin, where his grand-daughter was living in\r\nthe midst of her poultry, the portrait of this brilliant officer, to\r\nwhose name will ever attach an elegant and charming renown; for if,\r\nlike Cambronne, Anteroches did not really utter the words attributed\r\nto him, they have still been lent to him, and if thus lent, assuredly\r\nbecause there were grounds for it.\r\n\r\nAfter these over-lengthy reflections, I turned toward the peasant\r\nwoman, who now inspired me with profound commiseration. She continued\r\nto rock to and fro her bandaged infant, who was in very right and deed\r\nthe Count of Anteroches. I inquired what was the occupation of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\"He is dead,\" she replied; \"I was better off during his lifetime. He\r\nwas a _gendarme_, Monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"A _gendarme_!\" I repeated with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Madame d'Anteroches, who understood not the cause of my\r\nastonishment, \"he had even passed as a brigadier during his latter\r\nyears: we managed our little affairs very comfortably.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a brigadier of gendarmerie--content to be so--he managed his\r\nlittle affairs very comfortably--and his grandfather, as I find it in\r\nthe \"Military Records of France,\" had been named Marshal on the 25th\r\nof July, 1762; at the same time as the Marquis of Boufflers and the\r\nDuke of Mazarine! Would not the rabble of Paris do well to inquire a\r\nlittle before exclaiming so loudly against the privileges of the\r\naristocracy? Moreover, it seems to me that the government of France\r\nshould not allow the grandchildren of the Count of Anteroches to be\r\nsunk--as they are--into deplorable indigence. Apocryphal or otherwise\r\nthe epigram of Fontenoy should at least be worth subsistence to all\r\nwho bear this name. Many enjoy pensions and are maintained by France,\r\nwho would find it very difficult to produce a similar claim, and the\r\nnew republic would act wisely by repairing, when occasion turns up,\r\nthe injustices of her eldest sister.\r\n\r\nBut it was now high time for us to leave. It was evident that we\r\nembarrassed our hostess, and since we had discovered her name we were\r\nno less embarrassed ourselves. I could not get over her coarse stuff\r\ngown, her filthy kitchen, and her familiar sow. It would have been\r\ncruel to ask for her hospitality, and how could we offer to pay our\r\nscore? Besides, we knew that a rich proprietor of our acquaintance\r\nresided not far from Puy d'Arnac; we, therefore, took our leave of the\r\nhigh-born peasant with many excuses and thanks. At the moment I passed\r\nthe threshold, I cast a parting glance upon the portrait. The fire\r\nlighted it up at that instant with so singular a brilliancy that it\r\nalmost appeared animated. It seemed as if the countenance of M.\r\nd'Anteroches was alive, and that the handsome officer looked sadly\r\ndown from the height of his gilded frame upon the utter misery of his\r\ndescendants. \"Oh! decadence! decadence of France!\" I exclaimed to\r\nmyself, and rushed bravely forth with my companions into the pelting\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Fontenoy, we should here observe, is, we believe, the _only_\r\nbattle in which the English were defeated by the French, and it is, of\r\ncourse, a subject of no little glorification with our neighbors.\r\n\r\n[6] The well-known burst of the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo, \"Up,\r\nguards, and at them!\" has been declared, upon the best authority,\r\nnamely, his own, to be no less apocryphal than those above-mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine\r\n\r\nTHE CLOISTER-LIFE OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 28th of September, 1556, was a great day in the annals of Laredo,\r\nin Biscay. Once a commercial station of the Romans, and, in later\r\ntimes, the naval arsenal whence St. Ferdinand sailed to the\r\nGuadalquivir and the conquest of Seville, its haven is now so decayed\r\nand sand-choked, that it can scarcely afford shelter to a\r\nfishing-craft. Here, however, on the day in question, three centuries\r\nago, a fleet of seventy Flemish and Spanish sail cast anchor. From a\r\nfrigate bearing the imperial standard of the house of Austria came a\r\ngroup of gentlemen and ladies, of whom the principal personage was a\r\nspare and sallow man, past the middle age, and plainly attired in\r\nmourning. He was received at the landing-place by the bishop of\r\nSalamanca and some attendants, and being worn with suffering and\r\nfatigue, he was carried up from the boat in a chair. By his side\r\nwalked two ladies, in widows' weeds, who appeared to be about the same\r\nage as himself, and whose pale features, both in cast and expression,\r\nstrongly resembled his own. Since Columbus stepped ashore at Palos,\r\nwith his red men from the New World, Spain had seen no debarkation so\r\nremarkable; for the voyagers were, the emperor Charles V. and his\r\nsisters, Mary queen of Hungary, and Eleanor, queen of Portugal and\r\nFrance, now on their way from Brussels, where they had made their last\r\nappearance on the stage of the world, to those Spanish cloisters,\r\nwherein they had resolved to await the hour when the curtain should\r\ndrop on life itself.\r\n\r\nCharles himself appears to have been powerfully affected by the scene\r\nand circumstances around him. Kneeling upon the long-desired soil of\r\nSpain, he is said to have kissed the earth, ejaculating, \"I salute\r\nthee, O common mother! Naked came I forth of the womb to receive the\r\ntreasures of the earth, and naked am I about to return to the bosom of\r\nthe universal mother.\" He then drew from his bosom the crucifix which\r\nhe always wore, and kissing it devoutly, returned thanks to the\r\nSaviour for having thus brought him in safety to the wished-for haven.\r\nThe ocean itself furnished its comment upon the irretraceable step\r\nwhich he had taken. From Flushing to Laredo, the weather had been\r\ncalm, and the voyage prosperous: but the evening of the day of\r\nlanding closed with a storm, which shattered and dispersed the fleet,\r\nand sunk the frigate which the emperor had quitted a few hours before.\r\nThis accident must have recalled to his recollection a similar escape\r\nwhich he had made many years before on his coronation-day at Bologna.\r\nThere he had just passed through a wooden gallery which connected his\r\npalace with the church where the pope and the crown awaited him, when\r\nthe props upon which the structure rested gave way, and it fell with a\r\nsudden crash, killing several persons in the street below.\r\n\r\nThe emperor's first care, after landing, was to send a message to the\r\ngeneral of the order of St. Jerome, requiring his attendance at\r\nValladolid, and desiring that no time might be lost in preparing the\r\nconvent of Yuste for his reception. He himself set forward, as soon as\r\nhe was able, and was carried sometimes in a horse-litter, sometimes in\r\na chair on men's shoulders, by slow and painful stages to Burgos. Near\r\nthat ancient city he was met by the constable of Castille, Pedro\r\nFernandez de Velasco, who lodged him for some days in the noble palace\r\nof his family, known as the Casa del Cordon, from a massive cord of\r\nSt. Francis, wrought in stone, with which the architect has adorned\r\nand protected the great portal. The little town of Duenas was the next\r\nresting-place, and there its lord, the count of Buendia, did the\r\nhonors of his feudal castle on the adjacent height rising abruptly\r\nfrom the bare plains of the Arlanzon. At Torquemada, the royal party\r\nwas received by the bishop of the diocese, Pedro de Gasca, a divine,\r\nwhose skilful diplomacy, in repressing a formidable rebellion, had\r\nsaved Peru to Castille, and who had lately been rewarded by the\r\nemperor with the mitre of Palencia. But in spite of these\r\ndemonstrations of respect and gratitude, Charles was made painfully\r\nsensible of the change which his own act had wrought in his condition.\r\nThe barons and the great churchmen, who, a few months before, would\r\nhave flocked from all parts to do him honor, now appeared in very\r\nscanty numbers, or they permitted him to pass unnoticed through the\r\nlands and by the homes which they perhaps owed to his bounty. He and\r\nhis sister Eleanor must have remembered with a sigh the time when he\r\nfirst set foot in Spain, thirty-eight years before, and found the\r\nshores of Asturias, and the highways of Castille, thronged with loyal\r\ncrowds, hastening to tender their homage. In the forgetfulness of the\r\nnew generation, he may also have been reminded how he himself had\r\ntreated, with coldness and slighting, the great cardinal Ximenes, who\r\nhad worn out his declining years in defending and maintaining the\r\nprerogatives of the catholic crown. His long and varied experience of\r\nmen made him incapable of deriving any pleasure from their applause,\r\nbut not altogether incapable of being pained by their neglect. His\r\npride was hurt at finding himself so quickly forgotten; and he is said\r\nto have evinced a bitter sense of the surprise, by the remark, \"I\r\nmight well say that I was naked!\" It is probable, therefore, that he\r\ndeclined the honors of a public entry into Valladolid, not merely from\r\na desire to shun the pomps and vanities of state, but also from a\r\nsecret apprehension that it might prove but a pitiful shadow of former\r\npageants. That the citizens might not be balked of their show, while\r\nthe emperor entered privately on the 23rd of October, it was agreed\r\nthat the two queens, his sisters, should make their appearance there\r\nin a public manner the next day.\r\n\r\nValladolid was at that time the opulent and flourishing capital of\r\nSpain, and the seat of government, carried on under the regency of the\r\nemperor's daughter, Juanna. This young princess was the widow of the\r\nprince of Brazil, heir-apparent of the crown of Portugal, and mother\r\nof the unfortunate king Sebastian. She performed the duties of her\r\nhigh place with great prudence, firmness, and moderation; but with\r\nthis peculiarity, that she appeared at her public receptions closely\r\nveiled, allowing her face to be seen only for a moment, that the\r\nforeign ambassadors might be satisfied of her personal identity. With\r\nher nephew, Don Carlos, then a boy of ten years old, by her side, the\r\nInfanta met her father on the staircase of the palace of the Count of\r\nMelito, which he had chosen for his place of sojourn. The day\r\nfollowing, the arrival of the two queens was celebrated by a grand\r\nprocession, and by an evening banquet and ball in the royal palace, at\r\nwhich the emperor appears to have been present. Some few of the\r\ngrandees, the Admiral and the Constable of Castille, Benavente,\r\nAstorga, Sesa, and others, were there to do honor to their ancient\r\nlord, whose hand was also kissed in due form by the members of the\r\ncouncil of Castille. At this ball, or perhaps at some later festivity,\r\nCharles caused the wives of all his personal attendants to be\r\nassembled around him, and bade each, in particular, farewell. Perico\r\nde Sant Erbas, a famous jester of the court, passing by at the moment,\r\nthe emperor good-humoredly saluted him by taking off his hat. \"What!\r\ndo you uncover to me?\" said the bitter fool; \"does it mean that you\r\nare no longer emperor?\" \"No, Pedro,\" replied the object of the jest;\r\n\"it means that I have nothing to give you beyond this courtesy.\"\r\n\r\nDuring his stay of ten days, Charles bestowed but a passing glance on\r\nthe machine of government over which he had so long presided, and\r\nwhich was now directed by his demure daughter. The secretary of the\r\ncouncil, Juan Vazquez de Molina, an old and trusted servant of his\r\nown, was the only public man with whom he held any confidential\r\nconverse. The new rooms which he had caused to be erected at Yuste,\r\nand the ordering of his life there, were now of more moment to him\r\nthan the movements of the leaguers in Flanders, or the state of\r\nopinion in Germany. He therefore gave frequent audiences to Francisco\r\nde Tofino, the general of the Jeromites, and to Fray Martin de Angulo,\r\nprior of Yuste. Having resolved that his solitude should be shared by\r\nhis natural son, Don Juan of Austria, a nameless lad of ten, then\r\nliving in the family of his mayordomo, Luis de Quixada, he despatched\r\nthat trusty follower to remove his household from Castille to\r\nEstremadura.\r\n\r\nIt was at Valladolid that Charles saw for the first and last time the\r\nill-fated child who bore his name, and had the prospect one day of\r\nwearing some of his crowns. Although only ten years old, Don Carlos\r\nhad already shown symptoms of the mental malady which darkened the\r\nlong life of queen Juana, his great-grandmother by the side both of\r\nhis father, Philip of Spain, and of his mother, Mary of Portugal. Of a\r\nsullen and passionate temper, he lived in a state of perpetual\r\nrebellion against his aunt, and displayed in the nursery the weakly\r\nmischievous spirit which marked his short career at his father's\r\ncourt. His grandfather appears not to have suspected that his mind was\r\ndiseased, but to have regarded him as a forward and untractable child,\r\nwhose future interests would be best served by an unsparing use of the\r\nrod. He therefore recommended increased severity of discipline, and\r\nremarked to his sisters, that he had observed with concern the boy's\r\nunpromising conduct and manners, and that it was very doubtful how the\r\nman would turn out. This opinion was conveyed by queen Eleanor to\r\nPhilip II., who had requested his aunt to note carefully the\r\nimpression left by his son on the emperor's mind; and it is said to\r\nhave laid the foundation for the aversion which the king entertained\r\ntowards Carlos. Following the advice of her father, the Infanta soon\r\nafter ordered the removal of the prince to Burgos; but the plague\r\nbreaking out in that city, he was sent, by an ominous chance, to\r\nTordesillas, to the palace from whose windows the unhappy Juana, dead\r\nto the living world, had gazed for forty-seven years at the sepulchre\r\nof her fair and faithless lord.\r\n\r\nA sojourn of about ten days at Valladolid sufficed the emperor for\r\nrest, and for the preparations for his journey. His daughter was\r\noccupied with the duties of administration; and of his sisters he\r\nappears to have seen enough on the way from Flanders. Whether it was\r\nthat he was weary of these royal matrons, or that he regarded their\r\nsociety as a worldly enjoyment which he ought to forego, he declined\r\ntheir proposal to come and reside near his retreat, at Plasencia.\r\nAfter much debate, they finally chose Guadalaxara as their residence,\r\nwhere they quarelled with the duke of Infantado for refusing them his\r\npalace, and went to open war with the alcalde for imprisoning one of\r\ntheir serving-men.\r\n\r\nEarly in November,[7] their brother set out on his last earthly\r\njourney. The distance from Valladolid to Yuste was between forty and\r\nfifty leagues, or somewhere between 130 and 150 English miles. The\r\nroute taken has not been specified by the emperor's biographers. The\r\nbest and the easiest road lay through Salamanca and Plasencia. But as\r\nhe does not appear to have passed through the latter city, he probably\r\nlikewise avoided the former, and the pageants and orations with which\r\nthe doctors of the great university would have delighted to celebrate\r\nhis visit. In that case, he must have taken the road by Medina del\r\nCampo and Penaranda. At Medina he doubtless was lodged in the fine old\r\npalace of the crown, called the Torre de Mota, where, fifty years\r\nbefore, his grandmother, Isabella the Catholic, ended her noble life\r\nand glorious reign; and at Penaranda he was probably entertained in\r\nthe mansion of the Bracamontes. These two towns rise like islands in\r\ntheir naked undulating plains, covered partly with corn, partly with\r\nmarshy heath. Southward, the country is clothed with straggling woods\r\nof evergreen oak, becoming denser at the base and on the lower slopes\r\nof the wild Sierra of Bejar, the centre of that mountain chain which\r\nforms the backbone of the Peninsula, extending from Moncayo in Aragon,\r\nto the Rock of Lisbon on the Atlantic. At the alpine town of Bejar,\r\ncresting a bold height, and overhanging a tumbling stream, the great\r\nfamily of the Zunigas, created dukes of the place by Isabella, and\r\nknown to fame in arts and arms and the dedication of Don Quixote,\r\npossess a noble castle, ruined by the French, which there can be\r\nlittle doubt served as a halting-place for the imperial pilgrim. He\r\nadvanced by very short stages, travelling in a litter, and often\r\nsuffering great pain. But his spirits rose as he neared the desired\r\nhaven. In the craggy gorge of Puertonuevo, as he was being carried\r\nover some unusually difficult ground in a chair, his attendants were\r\ndeploring the extreme ruggedness of the pass. \"I shall never have to\r\ngo through another,\" said he, \"and truly it is worth enduring some\r\npain to reach so sweet and healthy a resting place as Yuste.\" Having\r\ncrossed the mountains without mischance, he arrived on the eleventh of\r\nNovember, St. Martin's day, at Xarandilla, a little village at the\r\nfoot of the steep Penanegra, and then, as now, chiefly peopled with\r\nswineherds, whose pigs, feeding in the surrounding forests, maintain\r\nthe fame of porciferous Estremadura. Here he took up his abode in the\r\ncastle of the count of Oropesa, head of a powerful branch of the great\r\nhouse of Toledo, and feudal lord of Xarandilla.\r\n\r\nThis visit, which was intended to be brief, was prolonged for nearly\r\nthree months. Before entering the cloister of Yuste, the emperor\r\nwished to pay off the greater part of his retinue. But for this\r\npurpose money was needful, and money was the one thing always wanting\r\nin the affairs of Spain. The delay which took place in providing it on\r\nthis occasion has often been cited as an instance of the ingratitude\r\nof Philip II.; but it is probable that a bare exchequer and a clumsy\r\nsystem of finance, which crippled his actions as a king, have also\r\nblackened his character as a son.\r\n\r\nThe emperor endured the annoyance with his usual coolness. On his\r\narrival at the castle, he was waited on by the prior of Yuste, with\r\nwhom he had already become acquainted at Valladolid. He afterwards\r\nrepaid the attention by making a forenoon excursion to Yuste, and\r\ninspecting more carefully the spot which his memory and his hope had\r\nso long pictured as the sweetest nook in a world of disappointment.\r\nThis visit took place on the 23d of November, St. Catharine's day. On\r\nalighting at the convent, Charles immediately repaired to the church,\r\nand prayed there awhile; after which, he was conducted over the\r\nmonastic buildings, and then over the new apartments which had been\r\nerected for his reception. The plan of this addition had been made by\r\nthe architect, Gaspar de Vega, from a sketch, it is said, drawn by the\r\nemperor's own hand. He now expressed himself as quite satisfied with\r\nthe accuracy with which his ideas had been wrought out, and returned\r\nthrough the wintry woods in high good humor.\r\n\r\nThe arrival at Xarandilla of Luis Quixada, with Don Juan of Austria,\r\nwas another of those little incidents which had become great events in\r\nthe life of Charles. As he did not choose during his life to\r\nacknowledge the youth as his son, the future hero of Lepanto passed\r\nfor the page of Quixada, and was presented to his father as bearer of\r\nan offering from Dona Magdalena de Ulloa. He was then in his twelfth\r\nyear, and was remarkable for his personal beauty and his engaging\r\nmanners. These so captivated Charles, that he ever afterwards liked to\r\nhave the boy about him; and it was one of the few solaces of his\r\nsolitude to note the princely promise of this unknown son of his old\r\nage.\r\n\r\nAt length, the tardy treasury messenger arrived, bearing a bag of\r\nthirty thousand ducats for the former possessor of Mexico and Peru.\r\nThe emperor was now enabled to pay their wages to the servants whom he\r\nwas about to discharge. Some of these he recommended to the notice of\r\nthe king or the princess-regent; to others he dispensed sparing\r\ngratuities in money; and so he closed his accounts with the world.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the third of February, 1557, being the feast of\r\nSt. Blas, he was lifted into his litter for the last time, and was\r\nborne westward along the rough mountain track, beneath the leafless\r\noaks, to the monastery of Yuste. He was accompanied by the count of\r\nOropesa, Don Fernando de Toledo, and his own personal suite, including\r\nthe followers whom he had just discharged, but who evinced their\r\nrespect by attending him to his journey's close. The cavalcade reached\r\nYuste about five in the evening. Prior Angulo was waiting to receive\r\nhis imperial guest at the gate. On alighting, the emperor, being\r\nunable to walk, was placed in a chair, and carried to the door of the\r\nchurch. At the threshold he was met by the whole brotherhood in\r\nprocession, chanting the _Te Deum_ to the music of the organ. The\r\naltars and the aisle were brilliantly lighted up with tapers, and\r\ndecked with their richest frontals, hangings, and plate. Borne through\r\nthe pomp to the steps of the high altar, Charles knelt down and\r\nreturned thanks to God for the happy termination of his journey, and\r\njoined in the vesper service of the brotherhood. When that was ended,\r\nthe friars came to be presented to him one by one, each kissing his\r\nhand and receiving his fraternal embrace. During this ceremony, his\r\ndeparting servants stood round, expressing their emotion by tears and\r\nlamentations, which were still heard late in the evening, around the\r\ngate of the convent. Attended by the count of Oropesa and the\r\ngentlemen of his suite, Charles then retired to take possession of his\r\nnew home, and to enter upon that life of prayer and repose for which\r\nhe had so long sighed.\r\n\r\nThe monastery of Yuste stands on the lower slopes of the lofty\r\nmountain chain which walls towards the north the beautiful Vera, or\r\nvalley of Plasencia. The city of Plasencia is seated seven leagues to\r\nthe westward in the plains below; the village of Quacos lies about an\r\nEnglish mile to the south, towards the foot of the mountain. The\r\nmonastery owes its name to a streamlet which descends from the sierra,\r\nand its origin to the piety of one Sancho Martin of Quacos, who\r\ngranted in 1402 a piece of land to two hermits from Plasencia. Here\r\nthese holy men built their cells and planted an orchard, and obtained,\r\nin 1408, by the favor of the Infanta Don Fernando, a bull for the\r\nfoundation of a Jeromite house in the rule of St. Augustine. In spite,\r\nhowever, of this authority, while the works were still in progress,\r\nthe friars of a neighboring convent, armed with an order from the\r\nbishop of Plasencia, set upon them and dispossessed them of their land\r\nand unfinished walls, an act of violence against which they appealed\r\nto the archbishop of Santiago. The judgment of the primate being given\r\nin their favor, they next applied for aid to their neighbor, Garci\r\nAlvarez de Toledo, lord of Oropesa, who accordingly came forth from\r\nhis castle of Xarandilla, and drove out the intruders. Nor was it only\r\nwith the strong hand that this noble protected the young community;\r\nfor at the chapter of St. Jerome held at Guadalupe in 1415, their\r\nhouse would not have been received into the order but for his\r\ngenerosity in guaranteeing a revenue sufficient for the maintenance of\r\na prior and twelve brethren under a rule in which mendicancy was\r\nforbidden. The buildings were also erected at his cost, and his\r\nsubsequent benefactions were large and frequent. He was therefore\r\nconstituted by the grateful monks protector of the convent, and the\r\ndistinction became hereditary in his descendants, the counts of\r\nOropesa.\r\n\r\nTheir early struggles past, the Jeromites of Yuste grew and prospered.\r\nGifts and bequests were the chief events in their peaceful annals.\r\nThey became patrons of the chapelries and hermitages; they made them\r\norchards and olive-groves, and their corn and wine increased. Their\r\nhostel, dispensary, and other offices, were patterns of monastic\r\ncomfort and order; and in due time, they built a new church, a simple,\r\nsolid, and spacious structure, in the pointed style. A few years\r\nbefore the emperor came to live amongst them, they had added to their\r\nsmall antique cloister a new quadrangle of stately proportions and\r\nelegant classical design.\r\n\r\nThough more remarkable for the natural beauty around its walls than\r\nfor the vigor of the spiritual life within, Yuste did not fail to\r\nboast of its worthies. The prior Jerome, a son of the great house of\r\nZuniga, was cited as a model of austere and active holiness. The lay\r\nbrother, Melchor de Yepes, crippled in felling a huge chesnut-tree in\r\nthe forest, was a pattern of bed-ridden patience and piety. Fray\r\nHernando de Corral was the scholar and book collector of the house;\r\nalthough he was also, for that reason, perhaps, considered as scarcely\r\nof a sound mind. He left many copious notes in the fly-leaves of his\r\nblack-letter folios. Fray Juan de Xeres, an old soldier of the great\r\nCaptain, was distinguished by the gift of second-sight, and was nursed\r\non his death-bed by the eleven thousand virgins. Still more favored\r\nwas Fray Rodrigo de Caceres, for the Blessed Mary herself, in answer\r\nto his repeated prayers, came down in visible shape, and received his\r\nspirit on the eve of the feast of her Assumption. And prior Diego de\r\nSan Geronimo was so popular in the Vera as a preacher, that when he\r\ngrew old and infirm, the people of Garganta la Olla endeavored to lure\r\nhim to their pulpit by making a road, which was called that of Fray\r\nDiego.\r\n\r\nIn works of charity--that redeeming virtue of the monastic system--the\r\nfathers of Yuste were diligent and bounteous. Six hundred fanegas, or\r\nabout one hundred and twenty quarters of wheat, in ordinary years, and\r\nin years of scarcity, as much as fifteen hundred fanegas, were\r\ndistributed at the convent-gate; large donations of bread, meat, and\r\noil, and some money, were made, either publicly or in private, by the\r\nprior, at Easter and other festivals; and the sick poor in the village\r\nof Quacos were freely supplied with food, medicine, and advice.\r\n\r\nThe lodging, or palace, as the friars loved to call it, of the\r\nemperor, was constructed under the eye of Fray Antonio de Villacastin,\r\na brother of the house, and afterwards well known to fame as the\r\nmaster of the works at the Escorial. The site of it had been inspected\r\nin May, 1554, by Philip II., then on his way to England to marry queen\r\nMary Tudor. Backed by the massive south wall of the church, the\r\nbuilding presented its simple front of two stories to the garden and\r\nthe noontide sun. Each story contained four chambers, two on either\r\nside of a corridor, which traverses the structure from east to west,\r\nand leads at either end into a broad porch, or covered gallery,\r\nsupported on pillars, and open to the air. All the rooms were\r\nfurnished with ample fire-places, in accordance with the Flemish wants\r\nand ways of the inhabitants. The chambers which look on the garden are\r\nbright and pleasant, but those on the north side are gloomy, and even\r\ndark, the light being admitted only by windows opening on the\r\ncorridor, or on the external and deeply-shadowed porches. Charles\r\ninhabited the upper rooms, and slept in that at the north-east corner,\r\nfrom which a door or window had been cut through the church wall,\r\nwithin the chancel, and close to the high altar. From the eastern\r\nporch, or gallery, an inclined path led down into the garden, to save\r\nhim the fatigue of going up and down stairs. His attendants were, for\r\nthe most part, lodged in apartments built for them near the new\r\ncloister; and the hostel of the convent was given up to the physician,\r\nthe bakers, and the brewers. His private rooms being surrounded on\r\nthree sides by the garden, he took exclusive possession of that, and\r\nput it under the care of gardeners of his own. The friars established\r\ntheir potherbs in a piece of ground to the eastward, behind some tall\r\nelm trees, and adjoining the emperor's domain, but separated from it\r\nby a high wall, which they caused to be built when they found that he\r\nwished for complete seclusion.\r\n\r\nTime, with its chances and changes, has dealt rudely with this fair\r\nhome of the monarch and the monk. Yuste was sacked in 1809 by the\r\nFrench invader; and in later years, the Spanish reformer has\r\nannihilated the race of picturesque drones, who, for a while,\r\nre-occupied, and might have repaired the ruins of their pleasant hive.\r\nOf the two cloisters, the greater is choked with the rubbish of its\r\nfallen upper story, its richly-carved capitals peeping here and there\r\nfrom the soil and wild shrubs. Two sides of the smaller and older\r\ncloister still stands, with tottering blackened walls, and rotting\r\nfloors and ceilings. The strong, granite-vaulted church is a hollow\r\nshell; the fine wood-work of its stalls has been partly used for fuel,\r\npartly carried off to the parish church of Quacos; and the beautiful\r\nblue and yellow tiles which lined the chancel are fast dropping from\r\nthe walls. In the emperor's dwelling, the lower chambers are turned\r\ninto a magazine of firewood, and in the rooms above, where he lived\r\nand died, maize and olives are garnered, and the silkworm winds its\r\ncocoon in dust and darkness. But the lovely face of nature, the hill,\r\nthe forest, and the field, the generous soil and the genial sky,\r\nremain with charms unchanged, to testify how well the imperial eagle\r\nchose the nest wherein to fold his wearied wings. From the balcony of\r\nCharles's cabinet the eye ranges over a foreground of rounded knolls,\r\nclad in walnut and chestnut, in which the mountain dies gently away\r\ninto the broad bosom of the Vera. Not a building is in sight, but a\r\nsummer-house, peering above mulberry tops, at the lower side of the\r\ngarden, and a hermitage of Our Lady of Solitude, about a mile distant,\r\nhung upon a rocky height, that swells like an isle out of the sea of\r\nforest. Immediately below the windows the garden slopes gently to the\r\nsun, shaded here and there with the massive foliage of the fig, or\r\nfeathery almond boughs, and breathing perfume from tall orange-trees,\r\ncuttings of which some monks, themselves transplanted, vainly strove\r\nto keep alive at the bleak Escorial. And beyond the west wall, filling\r\nall the wide space in front of the gates of the convent and the\r\npalace, rises the noble shade of the great walnut-tree, _el nogal\r\ngrande_, of Yuste--a forest king, which has seen the hermit's cell\r\nrise into a royal convent, and sink into a ruin; which has seen the\r\nbeginning and the end of the Spanish order of Jerome, and the Spanish\r\ndynasty of Austria.\r\n\r\nAt Xarandilla, Charles had cast aside the last shreds of the purple.\r\nThe annual revenue which he had reserved to himself out of the wealth\r\nof half the world, was twelve thousand ducats, or about fifteen\r\nhundred pounds sterling. His confidential attendants were eleven in\r\nnumber: Luis Quixada, chamberlain and chief of the household; Martin\r\nGatzelu, secretary; William Van Male, gentleman of the chamber; Moron,\r\ngentleman of the chamber and almoner; Juan Gaytan, steward; Henrique\r\nMatisio Charles Pubest, usher; and two valets. Juanelo Turiano, an\r\nItalian engineer, who had acquired a considerable reputation by his\r\nhydraulic works to supply water to the Alcazar of Toledo, was engaged\r\nto assist in the philosophical experiments and mechanical labors which\r\nformed the emperor's principal amusement. Last, but not least, a\r\nJeromite father from Sta. Engracia, at Zaragoza, Fray Juan de Regla,\r\nfilled the important post of confessor. The lower rank of servants,\r\ncooks, brewers, bakers, grooms, and scullions, and a couple of\r\nlaundresses, swelled the total number of his household to about sixty\r\npersons, an establishment not greater than was then maintained by many\r\na private hidalgo.\r\n\r\nThe mayordomo, Luis Quixada, or, to give him his entire appellation,\r\nLuis Mendez Quixada Manuel de Figueredo y Mendoza, is worthy of\r\nnotice, not only as first minister of this tiny court, but as being\r\nclosely associated with one of the greatest names in the military\r\nhistory of Europe. A courtier and soldier from his early youth, he was\r\nheir of an elder brother, slain before Tunis, who had been one of the\r\nmost distinguished captains of the famous infantry of Castille; and he\r\nhad been himself for many years the tried companion-in-arms and the\r\ntrusted personal friend of the emperor. In 1549, he married Dona\r\nMagdalena de Ulloa, a lady of ancient race and gentlest nature, with\r\nwhom he retired for a while to his patrimonial lordship of\r\nVillagarcia, near Valladolid.\r\n\r\nOn his quitting the court at Brussels, Charles confided to his care\r\nhis illegitimate son, Don Juan of Austria, then a boy of four years\r\nold, exacting a promise of strict secrecy as to his parentage. The boy\r\nwas accordingly brought up with the tenderest care by the childless\r\nMagdalena: and the secret of his birth so well kept, that she, for\r\nmany years, suspected him to be the fruit of some early attachment of\r\nher lord. When the emperor retired to Yuste, Quixada followed him\r\nthither, removing his household from Villagarcia, and establishing it\r\nin the neighborhood of the convent, probably in the village of Quacos.\r\n\r\nHe was thus enabled to enjoy somewhat of the society of his wife, and\r\nthe emperor had the gratification of seeing his son when he chose. Don\r\nJuan was now a fine lad, in his eleventh year. He passed amongst the\r\nneighbors for Quixada's page, and remained under the guardianship of\r\nDona Magdalena, whose efforts to imbue him with devotion towards the\r\nBlessed Virgin are supposed by his historians to have borne good fruit\r\nin the banners, embroidered with Our Lady's image, which floated from\r\nhis galleys at Lepanto. He likewise exercised in the Yuste forest the\r\ncross-bow, which had dealt destruction amongst the sparrows of\r\nLeganes, his early home in Castille.\r\n\r\nIf the number of servants in the train of Charles should savor, in\r\nthis age, somewhat of unnecessary parade, the ascetic character of the\r\nrecluse will be redeemed by a glance at the interior of his dwelling.\r\n\"The palace of Yuste, when prepared for his reception, seemed,\" says\r\nthe historian Sandoval, \"rather to have been newly pillaged by the\r\nenemy, than furnished for a great prince.\" Accustomed from his infancy\r\nto the finest tapestry designed by Italian pencils for the looms of\r\nFlanders, he now lived within walls entirety bare, except in his\r\nbedchamber, which was hung with coarse brown or black cloth. The sole\r\nappliances for rest to be found in his apartments were a bed and an\r\nold arm-chair, not worth four reals. Four silver trenchers of the\r\nplainest kind, for the use of his table, were the only things amongst\r\nhis goods and chattels which could tempt a thief to break through and\r\nsteal. A few choice pictures alone remained with him, as memorials of\r\nthe magnificence which he had foregone, and of the arts which he had\r\nso loved. Over the high altar of the convent church, and within sight\r\nof his bed, he is said to have placed that celebrated composition\r\nknown as The Glory of Titian, a picture of the Last Judgment, in which\r\nCharles, his beautiful empress, and their royal children, were\r\nrepresented, in the great painter's noblest style, as entering the\r\nheavenly mansions of life eternal. He had also brought with him a\r\nportrait of the empress, and a picture of Our Lord's Agony in the\r\nGarden, likewise from the easel of Titian; and there is now at the\r\nEscorial a masterpiece by the same hand--St. Jerome praying in his\r\ngarden, which is traditionally reputed to have hung in his oratory at\r\nYuste.\r\n\r\nFrom the garden beneath the palace windows the emperor's table was\r\nsupplied with fruit and vegetables: and a couple of cows, grazing in\r\nthe forest, furnished him with milk. A pony and an old mule composed\r\nthe entire stud of the prince, who formerly took peculiar pleasure in\r\npossessing the stoutest chargers of Guelderland, and the fleetest\r\ngenets of Cordova.\r\n\r\nTo atone, perhaps, for such deficiency of creature comforts, the\r\ngeneral of the Jeromites and the prior of Yuste had been at some pains\r\nto provide their guest with spiritual luxuries. Knowing his passionate\r\nlove of music, they had recruited the force of their choir with\r\nfourteen or fifteen brethren, distinguished for their fine voices and\r\nmusical skill. And for his sole benefit and delectation, they had\r\nprovided no less than three preachers, the most eloquent in the\r\nSpanish fold of Jerome. The first of these, Fray Juan de Acaloras,\r\nharangued his way to the bishopric of the Canaries; the second, Fray\r\nFrancisco de Villalva, also obtained by his sermons great fame, and\r\nthe post of chaplain to Philip II.; while the third, Fray Juan de\r\nSantandres, though less noted as an orator, was had in reverence as a\r\nprophet, having foretold the exact day and hour of his own death.\r\n\r\nA short time sufficed for the emperor to accustom himself to the\r\nsimple and changeless tenor of monastic life. Every morning his\r\nconfessor appeared at his bed-side, to inquire how he had passed the\r\nnight, and to assist him in his private devotions. At ten he rose, and\r\nwas dressed by his valets; after which he heard mass in the convent\r\nchurch. According to his invariable habit, which in Italy was said to\r\nhave given rise to the saying, _dalla messa, alla mensa_ (from mass to\r\nmess), he went from church to dinner, about noon. Eating had ever been\r\none of his favorite pleasures, and it was now the only physical\r\ngratification which he could still enjoy, or was unable to resist. He\r\ncontinued, therefore, to dine upon the rich dishes against which his\r\nancient and trusty confessor, Cardinal Loaysa, had vainly protested a\r\nquarter of a century before. Eel-pasties, anchovies, and frogs were\r\nthe savory food which he loved, unwisely and too well, as Frederick\r\nafterwards loved his polenta. The meal was long, for his teeth were\r\nfew and far between; and his hands, also, were much disabled by gout,\r\nin spite of which he always chose to carve for himself. His physician\r\nattended him at table, and at least learned the cause of the mischiefs\r\nwhich his art was to counteract. While he dined, he conversed with the\r\ndoctor on matters of science, generally of natural history, and if any\r\ndifference of opinion arose between them, the confessor was sent for\r\nto settle the point out of Pliny. When the cloth was drawn, Fray Juan\r\nde Regla came to read to him, generally from one of his favorite\r\ndivines,--Augustine, Jerome, or Bernard; an exercise which was\r\nfollowed by conversation and an hour of slumber. At three o'clock, the\r\nmonks were assembled in the convent to hear a sermon delivered by one\r\nof the imperial preachers, or a passage read from the Bible, usually\r\nfrom the epistle to the Romans, the emperor's favorite book. To these\r\ndiscourses or readings Charles always listened with profound\r\nattention; and if sickness or letter-writing prevented his attendance,\r\nhe never failed to send a formal excuse to the prior, and to require\r\nfrom his confessor an account of what had been preached or read. The\r\nrest of the afternoon he sometimes whiled away in the workshop of\r\nTurriano, and in the construction of pieces of mechanism, especially\r\nclocks, of which more than a hundred were said, in one rather\r\nimprobable account, to tick in the emperor's apartments, and reckon to\r\na fraction the hours of his retired leisure. Sometimes he fed his pet\r\nbirds, which appear to have taken the place of the stately wolf-hounds\r\nthat followed at his heel in the days when he sat to Titian; or a\r\nstroll amongst his fruit-trees and flowers filled up the time to\r\nvespers and supper. At the lower end of the garden, approached by a\r\nclosely shaded path, there may still be seen the ruins of a little\r\nsummer-house, closely enbowered, and looking out upon the woodlands of\r\nthe Vera. Beyond this limit the emperor rarely extended his\r\nexcursions, which were always made, slowly and painfully, on foot; for\r\nthe first time that he mounted his pony he was seized with a violent\r\ngiddiness, and almost fell into the arms of his attendants. Such was\r\nthe last appearance, in the saddle, of the accomplished cavalier, of\r\nwhom his troopers used to say, that had he not been born a king, he\r\nwould have been the prince of light-horsemen, and whose seat and hand\r\nexcited at Calais gate the admiration of the English knights fresh\r\nfrom the tournays--\r\n\r\n    \"Where England vied with France in pride\r\n    On the famous field of gold.\"\r\n\r\nMusic, which had been one of the chief pleasures of his secular life,\r\ncontinued to solace and cheer him to the last. In the conduct of the\r\norgan and the choir he took the greatest interest, and through the\r\nwindow which opened from his bedchamber upon the high altar, his voice\r\nmight often be heard accompanying the chant of the friars. His ear\r\nnever failed to detect a wrong note, and the mouth whence it came; and\r\nhe would frequently mutter the name of the offender, with the addition\r\nof \"_hideputa bermejo_,\" or some other epithet which savored rather of\r\nthe soldier than the saint. Guerrero, a chapel-master of Seville,\r\nhaving presented him with his book of masses and motets, he caused one\r\nof the former to be performed before him. When it was ended, he\r\nremarked to his confessor that Guerrero was a cunning thief; and going\r\nover the piece, he pointed out the plagiarisms with which it\r\nabounded, and named the composers whose works had suffered pillage.\r\n\r\nIn laying down the sceptre, Charles had resolved to have no farther\r\npersonal concern with temporal affairs. The petitioners, who at first\r\nbesieged his retreat, soon ceased from troubling when they found\r\nthemselves referred to the princess-regent at Valladolid, or to the\r\nking in Flanders. He declined giving any attention to matters beyond\r\nthe walls of the convent, unless they concerned the interests of his\r\nchildren or the church. His advice was, however, frequently asked by\r\nhis son and daughter, and couriers often went and came between Yuste\r\nand the courts. But with the patronage of the state he never\r\ninterfered, except on two occasions, when he recommended the case of a\r\nCatalonian lady to the favorable consideration of the Infanta, and\r\nasked for an order of knighthood for a veteran brother in arms.\r\n\r\nThe rites of religion now formed the business of his life, and he\r\ntransacted that business with his usual method and regularity. No\r\nenthusiast novice was ever more solicitous to fulfil to the letter\r\nevery law of his rubric. On the first Sunday of his residence at the\r\nconvent, as he went to high mass, he observed the friar who was\r\nsprinkling the holy water, hesitate when his turn came to be aspersed.\r\nTaking the hyssop, therefore, from his hand, he bestowed a plentiful\r\nshower upon his own face and clothes, saying as he returned the\r\ninstrument, \"This, father, is the way you must do it, next time.\"\r\nAnother friar, offering the pyx to his lips in a similar diffident\r\nmanner, he took it between his hands, and not only kissed it\r\nfervently, but applied it to his forehead and eyes with true oriental\r\nreverence. Although provided with an indulgence for eating before\r\ncommunion, he never availed himself of it but when he was suffering\r\nfrom extreme debility; and he always heard two masses on the days when\r\nhe received the eucharist. On Ash Wednesday, he required his entire\r\nhousehold, down to the meanest scullion, to communicate, and on these\r\noccasions he stood on the top step of the altar, to observe that the\r\nmuster was complete. For the benefit of his Flemings, he had a\r\nchaplain of their country, who lived at Xarandilla, and came over at\r\nstated times, when his flock were assembled for confession. The\r\nemperor himself usually heard mass from the window of his bedchamber,\r\nwhich looked into the church; but at complines he went up into the\r\nchoir with the fathers, and prayed in a devout and audible tone, in\r\nhis tribune. During the season of Lent, which came round twice during\r\nhis residence at Yuste, he regularly appeared in his place in the\r\nchoir, on Fridays, when it was the custom of the fraternity to perform\r\ntheir discipline in public; and at the end of the appointed prayers,\r\nextinguishing the taper which he, like the rest, held in his hand, he\r\nflogged himself with such sincerity of purpose, that the scourge was\r\nstained with blood, and the beholders singularly edified. On Good\r\nFriday, he went forth at the head of his household, to adore the holy\r\ncross; and although he was so infirm that he was obliged to be almost\r\ncarried by the men on whom he leaned, he insisted upon prostrating\r\nhimself three times upon the ground, in the manner of the friars,\r\nbefore he approached the blessed symbol with his lips. The feast of\r\nSt. Matthew, his birthday--a day of great things in his life,--he\r\nalways celebrated with peculiar devotion. He appeared at mass, in a\r\ndress of ceremony, and wearing the collar of the Fleece; and at the\r\ntime of the offertory, he went forward, and expressed his gratitude to\r\nGod by a large donation. The church was thronged with strangers; and\r\nthe crowd who could not gain admittance was so great, that one sermon\r\nwas preached outside, whilst another was being pronounced before the\r\nemperor and his household within.\r\n\r\nWith the friars, his hosts, Charles lived on the most familiar and\r\nfriendly footing. When the visitors of the order paid their triennial\r\nvisit of inspection to Yuste, they represented to him, with all\r\nrespect, that his majesty himself was the only inmate of the convent\r\nwith whom they had any fault to find; and they entreated him to\r\ndiscontinue those benefactions which he was in the habit of bestowing\r\non the fraternity, and which the rule of St. Jerome did not allow his\r\nchildren to receive. He knew all the fathers by name and by sight, and\r\nfrequently conversed with them, as well as with the prior. One of his\r\nfavorites was a lay-brother, called Alonso Mudarra, once a man of rank\r\nand family in the world, and now working out his own salvation in the\r\nhumble post of cook to the convent. This worthy had an only daughter,\r\nwho did not share her father's contempt for mundane things. When she\r\ncame with her husband to visit him at Yuste, Fray Alonso, arrayed in\r\nhis dirtiest apron, thus addressed her: \"Daughter, behold my gala\r\napparel; obedience is now my treasure and my pride; for you, in your\r\nsilks and vanities, I entertain profound pity.\" So saying, he returned\r\nto his kitchen, and would never see her more: an effort of holiness to\r\nwhich he appears to owe his place in the chronicles of the order.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was conversing one day with his confessor, Regla, when\r\nthat priest chose to speak, in the mitre-shunning cant of his cloth,\r\nof the great reluctance which he had felt in accepting a post of such\r\nweighty responsibility. \"Never fear,\" said Charles, somewhat\r\nmaliciously, and as if conscious that he was dealing with a hypocrite;\r\n\"before I left Flanders, four doctors were engaged for a whole year in\r\neasing my conscience; so you have nothing to answer for but what\r\nhappens here.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had completed a year of residence at the convent, some\r\ngood-humored bantering passed between him and the master of the\r\nnovices about its being now time for him to make profession; and he\r\nafterwards said that he was prevented from taking the vows of the\r\norder, and becoming a monk in earnest, only by the state of his\r\nhealth. St. Blas's day, 1558, the anniversary of his arrival, was held\r\nas a festival, and celebrated by masses, the _Te Deum_, a precession\r\nby the fathers, and a sermon by Villalva. In the afternoon, the\r\nemperor gave a sumptuous repast to the whole convent, out in the\r\nfields, it being the custom of the fraternity to celebrate any\r\naccession to their number by a pic-nic. The country people about\r\nPlasencia sent a quantity of partridges and kids to aid the feast,\r\nwhich was likewise enlivened by the presence of the Flemish servants,\r\nmale and female, and his other retainers, from the village of Quacos.\r\nThe prior provided a more permanent memorial of the day by opening a\r\nnew book for the names of brethren admitted into the convent, on the\r\nfirst leaf of which the emperor inscribed his name--an autograph which\r\nremained the pride of the archives till their destruction by the\r\ndragoons of Buonaparte.\r\n\r\nThe retired emperor had not many visitors in his solitude; and of\r\nthese few, Juan de Vega, president of the council of Castille,\r\nwas the only personage in high office. He was sent down by the\r\nprincess-regent, apparently to see that her father was treated with\r\ndue attention by the provincial authorities. But with his neighbors,\r\ngreat and small, Charles lived in a state of amity which it would have\r\nbeen well for the world had he been able to maintain with his\r\nfellow-potentates of Christendom. The few nobles and gentry of the\r\nVera were graciously received when they came to pay their respects at\r\nYuste. Oropesa and his brothers frequently rode forth from Xarandilla,\r\nto inquire after the health of their former guest. From Plasencia came\r\na still more distinguished and no less welcome guest, Luis de Avila,\r\ncomendador-mayor of Alcantara. Long the _fidus Achates_ of the\r\nemperor, this soldier-courtier had obtained considerable fame by\r\nbecoming his Quintus Curtius. His Commentaries on the Wars against the\r\nProtestants of Germany, first published in 1546, had been several\r\ntimes reprinted, and had already been translated into Latin, French,\r\nFlemish, English, and Italian. Having married the wealthy heiress of\r\nthe Zunigas, he was now living in laurelled ease at Plasencia, in that\r\nfine palace of Mirabel, which is still one of the chief ornaments of\r\nthe beautiful city. The memoirs of the campaigns in Africa, which he\r\nis said to have left in manuscript, were perhaps the occupation of his\r\nleisure. Charles always received his historian with kindness, and it\r\nis characteristic of the times, that it was noted as a mark of\r\nsingular favor, that he ordered a capon to be reserved for him from\r\nhis own well-supplied board. It may seem strange that a retired\r\nprince, who had never been a lover of parade, should not have broken\r\nthrough the ceremonial law which condemned a monarch to eat alone. But\r\nwe must remember that he was a Spaniard living amongst Spaniards; and\r\nthat, near a century later, the force of forms was still so strong,\r\nthat the great minister of France, when most wanting in ships,\r\npreferred that the Spanish fleet should retire from the blockade of\r\nRochelle rather than that the admiral should wear his grandee hat in\r\nthe Most Christian presence.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was fond of talking over his feats of arms with the\r\nveteran who had shared and recorded them. One day, in the course of\r\nsuch conversation, Don Luis said he had caused a ceiling of his house\r\nto be painted in fresco, with a view of the battle of Renti, and the\r\nFrenchmen flying before the soldiers of Castille. \"Not so,\" said\r\nCharles; \"let the painter modify this if he can; for it was no\r\nheadlong flight, but an honorable retreat.\" This was not the less\r\ncandid, that French historians claim the victory for their own side.\r\nConsidering that the action had been fought only three or four years\r\nbefore it was said to have been painted, it is possible that Renti has\r\nbeen substituted for the name of some other less doubtful field. But\r\nLuis de Avila was of easy faith when the honor of Castille was\r\nconcerned, and may well be supposed capable of setting down a success\r\nto the wrong account, when he did not hesitate to record it in his\r\nbook, that the miracle of Ajalon had been repeated at Muhlberg. Some\r\nyears afterwards, the duke of Alva, who had been in that battle, was\r\nasked by the French king whether he had observed that the sun stood\r\nstill. \"I was so busy that day,\" said the old soldier, \"with what was\r\npassing on earth, that I had no time to notice what took place in\r\nheaven.\"\r\n\r\nAn anecdote of Avila and his master, though not falling within the\r\nperiod of their retirement to Estremadura, may be related here, as\r\nserving to show the characters of the two men. Some years before his\r\nabdication, Charles had amused the leisure of his sick-room by making\r\na prose translation of Olivier de la Marches' forgotten allegorical\r\npoem, _Le Chevalier delibere_. He then employed Fernando de Acunha, a\r\nman of letters attached to the Saxon court, to turn his labors into\r\nCastillian verse, and he finally handed it over to William Van Male,\r\none of the gentlemen of the chamber, telling him that he might publish\r\nit for his own benefit. Avila and the other Spaniards, hearing of the\r\nconcession, wickedly affected the greatest envy at the good fortune of\r\nthe Fleming; the historian, in particular, in his quality of author,\r\nassuring the emperor that the publication could not fail to realize a\r\nprofit of five hundred crowns. That desire to print, which, more or\r\nless developed, exists in every man who writes, being thus stimulated\r\nby the suggestion, that to gratify that desire, would be to confer a\r\nfavor which should cost him nothing, Charles became impatient to see\r\nhis lucubrations in type. Insisting that his bounty should be accepted\r\nat once, he turned a deaf ear to the timid hints of Van Male, as to\r\nthe risk and expense of the speculation; and the end was, that the\r\npoor man had to pay Jean Steels for printing and publishing two\r\nthousand copies of a book which is now scarce, probably because the\r\ngreater part of the impression passed at once from the publisher to\r\nthe pastry-cook. The waggery on the part of Avila was the more wicked,\r\nbecause the victim had translated his Commentaries into Latin for him.\r\nIt forms, however, the subject of an agreeable letter, wherein Van\r\nMale complains of the undue expectations raised in the emperor's mind\r\nby his \"windy Spaniards,\" and ruefully looks forward to reaping a\r\nharvest of mere straw and chaff.\r\n\r\nIt was not only by calling at Yuste that the noble lieges of the\r\nemperor testified their homage. Mules were driven to his gate laden\r\nwith more substantial tokens of loyalty and affection. The Count of\r\nOropesa kept his table supplied with game from the forest and the\r\nhill; and the prelates of Toledo, Mondonedo, Segovia, and Salamanca,\r\noffered similar proofs that they had not forgotten the giver of their\r\nmitres. The Jeromites of Guadalupe, rich in sheep and beeves, sent\r\ncalves, lambs fattened on bread, and delicate fruits; and from his\r\nsister Catharine, queen of Portugal, there came every fortnight a\r\nsupply of conserves and linen.\r\n\r\nThe villagers of Quacos alone furnished some exceptions to the respect\r\nin which their imperial neighbor was held. Although they received the\r\ngreater part of the hundred ducats which he dispensed every month for\r\ncharitable purposes, they poached the trout in the fish-ponds which\r\nhad been formed for his service in Garganta la Olla; and they drove\r\nhis cows to the parish pound whenever they strayed beyond their\r\nlegitimate pastures. One fellow having sold the crop on his\r\ncherry-tree, at double its value, to the emperor's purveyor, when he\r\nfound that it was left ungathered for a few days, took the opportunity\r\nof disposing of it a second time to another purchaser, who, of course,\r\nleft nothing but bare boughs to the rightful owner of the fruit.\r\nWearied with these annoyances, the emperor complained to the president\r\nof Castille, who administered to the district judge, one Licentiate\r\nMurga, a severe rebuke, which that functionary, in his turn, visited\r\nupon the unruly rustics. Several culprits were apprehended; but while\r\nCastillian justice was taking its deliberate course, some of them who\r\nwere related to friars of Yuste, by the influence of their friends at\r\ncourt, got the emperor himself to petition that the sentence might be\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nTo his servants Charles was a kind and lenient master. He bore\r\npatiently with Adrian the cook, though he left the cinnamon that he\r\nloved out of the dishes; and he contented himself with mildly\r\nadmonishing Pelayo, the baker, who got drunk and neglected his oven,\r\nof which the result was burnt bread that sorely tried the toothless\r\ngums of his master. His old military habits, however, still adhered to\r\nhim, and though gentle in his manner of enforcing it, he was something\r\nof a martinet in maintaining the discipline of his household and the\r\nconvent. Nor had he lost that love of petty economies which made him\r\nsit bare-headed in the rain without the walls of Naumburg, saving a\r\nnew velvet cap under his arm, while they fetched him an old one from\r\nthe town. Observing in his walks, or from his window, that a certain\r\nbasket daily came and went between his garden and the garden of the\r\nfriars, he caused Moron to institute an examination, which led to the\r\nharmless discovery that his Flemings were in the habit of bartering\r\negg-plants with the Jeromites for onions. He had also been disturbed\r\nby suspicious gatherings of young women at the convent-gate, who stood\r\nthere gossiping under pretence of receiving alms. When the visitors\r\ncame their rounds, he therefore brought the matter under their notice.\r\nThe result of the complaint was that the conventional dole was ordered\r\nto be sent round in certain portions to the alcaldes of the various\r\nvillages, for distribution on the spot; and, moreover, the crier went\r\ndown the straggling, uneven street of Quacos, making the ungallant\r\nproclamation, that any woman who should be found nearer to Yuste than\r\na certain oratory, about two gunshots from the gate, should be\r\npunished with a hundred stripes.\r\n\r\nIn the month of September, 1557, the emperor received a visit from his\r\nsisters, the queens Eleanor and Mary. These royal widows, weary of\r\nGuadalaxara, its unyielding duke, and its troublesome alcalde, were\r\nonce more in search of a residence. They had cast their eyes on the\r\nbanks of the Guadiana, and they were now on their way to that frontier\r\nof Portugal. Neither the convent nor the palace of Yuste being\r\nsufficiently commodious to receive them, they lived at Xarandilla, as\r\nguests of Oropesa. The shattered health of the queen of France\r\nrendered the journey from the castle to the convent, although\r\nperformed in a litter, so fatiguing to her, that she accomplished it\r\nonly twice. Nor was her brother's strength sufficient to enable him to\r\nreturn the visits of his favorite sister. But queen Mary was seven\r\nyears younger, and still possessed much of the vigor which amazed\r\nRoger Ascham, when he met her galloping into Tongres, far ahead of her\r\nsuit, although it was the tenth day she had passed in the saddle. She\r\ntherefore mounted her horse almost every day, and rode through the\r\nfading forest to converse with the recluse at Yuste. At the end of a\r\nfortnight, the queens took a sorrowful leave of their brother, and\r\nproceeded on their way to Badajoz, whither the Infanta Mary of\r\nPortugal, daughter of queen Eleanor, had come from Lisbon to receive\r\nthem. After this meeting, which was destined to be the last, the\r\nqueens returned to the little town of Talaverilla, on the bare plains\r\nof Merida, where they had determined to fix their abode. But they\r\nfound there no continuing city. In a few weeks, Eleanor was seized\r\nwith a fever, which carried her off on the 25th of February, 1558, the\r\nsixtieth year of her age. When the emperor heard of her illness, he\r\ndispatched Luis Quixada to attend upon her; but she was already at\r\nrest ere the mayordomo reached Talaverilla. Queen Mary went back with\r\nQuixada to Yuste. Her health being much shaken, and the emperor being\r\nunable to move from the convent, she was lodged, on this occasion, in\r\nhis apartments. At the end of eight days she bade him a last farewell,\r\nand retired to Cigales, a hamlet two leagues north of Valladolid, and\r\ncrowning a vine-clad hill on the western side of the valley of the\r\nPisuerga.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Sandoval says he left on the 4th November; Cabrera, that he left\r\non the 1st; and Siguenca gives the end of October as the time of his\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Household Words.\r\n\r\nOUR PHANTOM SHIP AMONG THE ICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nYonder is the coast of Norway; we shall soon be at Spitzbergen. The\r\n\"Phantom\" is fitted out for Arctic exploration, with instructions to\r\nfind her way, by the north-west, to Behring Straits, and take the\r\nSouth Pole on her passage home. Just now, we steer due north, and\r\nyonder is the coast of Norway. From that coast parted Hugh Willoughby,\r\nthree hundred years ago; the first of our countrymen who wrought an\r\nice-bound highway to Cathay. Two years afterwards his ships were\r\nfound, in the haven of Arzina, in Lapland, by some Russian fishermen;\r\nnear and about them Willoughby and his companions--seventy dead men.\r\nThe ships were freighted with their frozen crews, and sailed for\r\nEngland; but, \"being unstaunch, as it is supposed by their two years'\r\nwintering in Lapland, sunk, by the way, with their dead, and them also\r\nthat brought them.\"\r\n\r\nIce floats about us now, and here is a whale blowing; a whale, too,\r\nvery near Spitzbergen. When first Spitzbergen was discovered, in the\r\ngood old times, there were whales here in abundance; then a hundred\r\nDutch ships in a crowd, might go to work, and boats might jostle with\r\neach other, and the only thing deficient would be stowage room for all\r\nthe produce of the fishery. Now one ship may have the whole field to\r\nitself, and travel home with an imperfect cargo. It was fine fun in\r\nthe good old times; there was no need to cruise. Coppers and boilers\r\nwere fitted on the island, and little colonies about them, in the\r\nfishing season, had nothing to do but tow the whales in, with a boat,\r\nas fast as they were wanted by the copper. No wonder that so enviable\r\na Tom Tidler's ground was claimed by all who had a love for gold and\r\nsilver. The English called it theirs, for they first fished; the Dutch\r\nsaid, nay, but the island was of their discovery; Danes, Hamburghers,\r\nBiscayans, Spaniards, and French put in their claims; and at length,\r\nit was agreed to make partitions. The numerous bays and harbors which\r\nindent the coast were divided among the rival nations; and to this\r\nday, many of them bear, accordingly, such names as English Bay, Danes\r\nBay, and so forth. One bay there is, with graves in it, named Sorrow.\r\nFor it seemed to the fishers most desirable, if possible, to plant\r\nupon this island permanent establishments, and condemned convicts were\r\noffered, by the Russians, life and pardon, if they would winter in\r\nSpitzbergen. They agreed; but, when they saw the icy mountains and the\r\nstormy sea, repented, and went back, to meet a death exempt from\r\ntorture. The Dutch tempted free men, by high rewards, to try the\r\ndangerous experiment. One of their victims left a journal, which\r\ndescribes his sufferings and that of his companions. Their mouths, he\r\nsays, became so sore that, if they had food, they could not eat; their\r\nlimbs were swollen and disabled with excruciating pain; they died of\r\nscurvy. Those who died first were coffined by their dying friends; a\r\nrow of coffins was found, in the spring, each with a man in it; two\r\nmen uncoffined, side by side, were dead upon the floor. The journal\r\ntold, how once the traces of a bear excited their hope of fresh meat\r\nand amended health; how, with a lantern, two or three had limped upon\r\nthe track, until the light became extinguished, and they came back in\r\ndespair to die. We might speak, also, of eight English sailors, left,\r\nby accident, upon Spitzbergen, who lived to return and tell their\r\nwinter's tale; but a long journey is before us, and we must not linger\r\non the way. As for our whalers, it need scarcely be related that the\r\nmultitude of whales diminished as the slaughtering went on, until it\r\nwas no longer possible to keep the coppers full. The whales had to be\r\nsearched for by the vessels, and thereafter it was not worth while to\r\ntake the blubber to Spitzbergen to be boiled; and the different\r\nnations, having carried home their coppers, left the apparatus of\r\nthose fishing stations to decay.\r\n\r\nTake heed. There is a noise like thunder, and a mountain snaps in two.\r\nThe upper half comes, crashing, grinding, down into the sea, and\r\nloosened streams of water follow it. The sea is displaced before the\r\nmighty heap; it boils and scatters up a cloud of spray; it rushes\r\nback, and violently beats upon the shore. The mountain rises from its\r\nbath, sways to and fro, while water pours along its mighty sides; now\r\nit is tolerably quiet, letting crackers off as air escapes out of its\r\ncavities. That is an iceberg, and in that way are all icebergs formed.\r\nMountains of ice formed by rain and snow--grand Arctic glaciers,\r\nundermined by the sea or by accumulation overbalanced--topple down\r\nupon the slightest provocation (moved by a shout, perhaps) and where\r\nthey float, as this black looking fellow does, they need deep water.\r\nThis berg in height is about ninety feet, and a due balance requires\r\nthat a mass nine times as large as the part visible should be\r\nsubmerged. Icebergs are seen about us now which rise two hundred feet\r\nabove the water's level.\r\n\r\nThere are above head plenty of aquatic birds; ashore, or on the ice,\r\nare bears, foxes, reindeer; and in the sea there are innumerable\r\nanimals. We shall not see so much life near the North Pole, that is\r\ncertain. It would be worth while to go ashore upon an islet there,\r\nnear Vogel Sang, to pay a visit to the eider-ducks. Their nests are\r\nso abundant that one cannot avoid treading on them. When the duck is\r\ndriven by a hungry fox to leave her eggs, she covers them with down,\r\nin order that they may not cool during her absence, and, moreover,\r\nglues the down into a case with a secretion supplied to her by Nature\r\nfor that purpose. The deserted eggs are safe, for that secretion has\r\nan odor very disagreeable to the intruder's nose.\r\n\r\nWe still sail northward, among sheets of ice, whose boundaries are not\r\nbeyond our vision from the mast-head--these are \"floes;\" between them\r\nwe find easy way, it is fair \"sailing ice.\" In the clear sky to the\r\nnorth, a streak of lucid white light is the reflection from an icy\r\nsurface; that is \"ice-blink,\" in the language of these seas. The glare\r\nfrom snow is yellow, while open water gives a dark reflection.\r\n\r\nNorthward still; but now we are in fog the ice is troublesome; a gale\r\nis rising. Now, if our ship had timbers, they would crack, and if she\r\nhad a bell it would be tolling; if we were shouting to each other we\r\nshould not hear, the sea is in a fury. With wild force its breakers\r\ndash against a heaped-up wall of broken ice, that grinds and strains\r\nand battles fiercely with the water. This is \"the pack,\" the edge of a\r\ngreat ice-field broken by the swell. It is a perilous and exciting\r\nthing to push through pack ice in a gale.\r\n\r\nNow there is ice as far as eye can see, that is \"an ice-field.\" Masses\r\nare forced up like colossal tombstones on all sides; our sailors call\r\nthem \"hummocks;\" here and there the broken ice displays large \"holes\r\nof water.\" Shall we go on? Upon this field, in 1827, Parry adventured\r\nwith his men, to reach the North Pole, if that should be possible.\r\nWith sledges and portable boats they labored on, through snow, and\r\nover hummocks; launching their boats over the larger holes of water.\r\nWith stout hearts, undaunted by toil or danger, they went boldly on,\r\nthough by degrees it became clear to the leaders of the expedition,\r\nthat they were almost like mice upon a treadmill cage, making a great\r\nexpenditure of leg for little gain. The ice was floating to the south\r\nwith them, as they were walking to the north; still they went on.\r\nSleeping by day to avoid the glare, and to get greater warmth during\r\nthe time of rest, and travelling by night,--watch-makers' days and\r\nnights, for it was all one polar day,--the men soon were unable to\r\ndistinguish noon from midnight. The great event of one day on this\r\ndreary waste was the discovery of two flies upon an ice hummock;\r\nthese, says Parry, became at once a topic of ridiculous importance.\r\nPresently, after twenty-three miles walking, they only had gone one\r\nmile forward, the ice having industriously floated twenty-two miles in\r\nan opposite direction; and then, after walking forward eleven miles,\r\nthey found themselves to be three miles behind the place from which\r\nthey started. The party accordingly returned, not having reached the\r\nPole, not having reached the eighty-third parallel, for the attainment\r\nof which there was a reward of a thousand pounds held out by\r\ngovernment. They reached the parallel of eighty-two degrees,\r\nforty-five minutes, which was, and still is, the most northerly point\r\ntrodden by the foot of man. From that point they returned. In those\r\nhigh latitudes they met with a phenomenon, common in alpine regions,\r\nas well as at the Pole, red snow. The red color being caused by the\r\nabundance of a minute plant, of low development, the last dweller on\r\nthe borders of the vegetable kingdom. More interesting to the sailors\r\nwas a fat she bear which they killed and devoured with a zeal to be\r\nrepented of; for on reaching navigable sea, and pushing in their boats\r\nto Table Island, where some stones were left, they found that the\r\nbears had eaten all their bread, whereon the men agreed that \"Bruin\r\nwas now square with them.\" An islet next to Table Island--they are\r\nboth mere rocks--is the most northern land discovered. Therefore,\r\nParry applied to it the name of lieutenant--now Sir James--Ross. This\r\ncompliment Sir James Ross has acknowledged in the most emphatic\r\nmanner, by discovering on his part, at the other Pole, the most\r\nsouthern land yet seen, and giving to it the name of Parry: \"Parry\r\nMountains.\"\r\n\r\nIt very probably would not be difficult under such circumstances as\r\nSir W. Parry has since recommended, to reach the North Pole along this\r\nroute. Then (especially if it be true, as many believe, that there is\r\na region of open sea about the Pole itself) we might find it as easy\r\nto reach Behring Straits, by travelling in a straight line over the\r\nNorth Pole, as by threading the straits and bays north of America.\r\n\r\nWe turn our course until we have in sight a portion of the ice-barred\r\neastern coast of Greenland, Shannon Island. Somewhere about this spot\r\nin the seventy-fifth parallel is the most northern part of that coast\r\nknown to us. Colonel--then Captain--Sabine in the \"Griper,\" was landed\r\nthere to make magnetic and other observations; for the same purpose he\r\nhad previously visited Sierra Leone. That is where we differ from our\r\nforefathers. They commissioned hardy seamen to encounter peril for the\r\nsearch of gold ore, or for a near road to Cathay, but our peril is\r\nencountered for the gain of knowledge, for the highest kind of service\r\nthat can now be rendered to the human race.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the northern sea, we must not omit to mention the\r\nvoyage by Spitzbergen northward, in 1818, of Captain Buchan in the\r\n\"Dorothea,\" accompanied by Lieutenant Franklin, in the \"Trent.\" It was\r\nSir John Franklin's first voyage to the Arctic regions. This trip\r\nforms the subject of a delightful book by Captain Beechey.\r\n\r\nOn our way to the south point of Greenland we pass near Cape North, a\r\npoint of Iceland. Iceland, we know, is the centre of a volcanic\r\nregion, whereof Norway and Greenland are at opposite points of the\r\ncircumference. In connection with this district there is a remarkable\r\nfact; that by the agency of subterranean forces a large portion of\r\nNorway and Sweden is being slowly upheaved. While Greenland, on the\r\nwest coast, as gradually sinks into the sea, Norway rises at the rate\r\nof about four feet in a century. In Greenland the sinking is so well\r\nknown that the natives never build close to the water's edge, and the\r\nMoravian missionaries more than once have had to move farther inland\r\nthe poles on which their boats are rested.\r\n\r\nOur Phantom Ship stands fairly now along the western coast of\r\nGreenland into Davis Straits. We observe that upon this western coast\r\nthere is, by a great deal, less ice than on the eastern. That is a\r\nrule generally. Not only the configuration of the straits and bays,\r\nbut also the earth's rotation from west to east, causes the currents\r\nhere to set towards the west, and wash the western coasts, while they\r\nact very little on the eastern. We steer across Davis Strait, among\r\n\"an infinite number of great countreys and islands of yee;\" there,\r\nnear the entrance, we find Hudson Strait, which does not now concern\r\nus. Islands probably separate this well-known channel from Frobisher\r\nStrait to the north of it, yet unexplored. Here let us recall to mind\r\nthe fleet of fifteen sail, under Sir Martin Frobisher, in 1578,\r\ntossing about and parting company among the ice. Let us remember how\r\nthe crew of the \"Anne Frances,\" in that expedition, built a pinnace\r\nwhen their vessel struck upon a rock, although they wanted main timber\r\nand nails. How they made a mimic forge, and \"for the easier making of\r\nnails, were forced to break their tongs, gridiron, and fire-shovel, in\r\npieces.\" How Master Captain Best, in this frail bark, with its\r\nimperfect timbers held together by the metamorphosed gridiron and\r\nfire-shovel, continued in his duty, and did \"depart up the straights\r\nas before was pretended.\" How a terrific storm arose, and the fleet\r\nparted, and the intrepid captain was towed \"in his small pinnace, at\r\nthe stern of the 'Michael,' thorow the raging seas; for the bark was\r\nnot able to receive or relieve half its company.\" The \"tongs,\r\ngridyron, and fire-shovell,\" performed their work only for as many\r\nminutes as were absolutely necessary, for \"the pinesse came no sooner\r\naboord the ship, and the men entred, but she presently shivered and\r\nfell in pieces, and sunke at the ship's stern with all the poor men's\r\nfurniture.\"\r\n\r\nNow, too, as we sail up the strait, explored a few years after these\r\nevents by Master John Davis, how proudly we remember him as a right\r\nworthy forerunner of those countrymen of his and ours who since have\r\nsailed over his track. Nor ought we to pass without calling to mind\r\nthe melancholy fate, in 1606, of Master John Knight, driven, in the\r\n\"Hopwell,\" among huge masses of ice, with a tremendous surf, his\r\nrudder knocked away, his ship half full of water, at the entrance to\r\nthese straits. Hoping to find a harbor, he set forth to explore a\r\nlarge island, and landed, leaving two men to watch the boat, while he,\r\nwith three men and the mate, set forth and disappeared over a hill.\r\nFor thirteen hours the watchers kept their post; one had his trumpet\r\nwith him, for he was a trumpeter, the other had a gun. They trumpeted\r\noften and loudly, they fired, but no answer came. They watched ashore\r\nall night for the return of their captain and his party, \"but they\r\ncame not at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe season is advanced. As we sail on, the sea steams like a\r\nlime-kiln, \"frost-smoke\" covers it. The water, cooled less rapidly, is\r\nwarmer now than the surrounding air, and yields this vapor in\r\nconsequence. By the time our vessel has reached Baffin's Bay, still\r\ncoasting along Greenland, in addition to old floes and bergs, the\r\nwater is beset with \"pancake ice.\" That is the young ice when it first\r\nbegins to cake upon the surface. Innocent enough it seems, but it is\r\nsadly clogging to the ships. It sticks about their sides like treacle\r\non a fly's wing; collecting unequally, it destroys all equilibrium,\r\nand impedes the efforts of the steersman. Rocks split on the Greenland\r\ncoast with loud explosions, and more icebergs fall. Icebergs we soon\r\nshall take our leave of; they are only found where there is a coast on\r\nwhich glaciers can form; they are good for nothing but to yield fresh\r\nwater to the vessels; it will be all field, pack, and salt-water ice\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nNow we are in Baffin's Bay, explored in the voyages of Bylot and\r\nBaffin, 1615-16. When, in 1817, a great movement in the Greenland ice\r\ncaused many to believe that the northern passages would be found\r\ncomparatively clear; and when, in consequence of this impression, Sir\r\nJohn Barrow succeeded in setting a-foot that course of modern Arctic\r\nexploration, which has been continued to the present day, Sir John\r\nRoss was the first man sent to find the north-west passage. Buchan and\r\nParry were commissioned at the same time to attempt the North Sea\r\nroute. Sir John Ross did little more on that occasion than effect a\r\nsurvey of Baffin's Bay, and prove the accuracy of the ancient pilot.\r\nIn the extreme north of the bay there is an inlet or a channel, called\r\nby Baffin Smith's Sound; this Sir John saw, but did not enter. It\r\nnever has been explored. It may be an inlet only; but it is also very\r\npossible that by this channel ships might get into the Polar Sea, and\r\nsail by the north shore of Greenland to Spitzbergen. Turning that\r\ncorner, and descending along the western coast of Baffin's Bay, there\r\nis another inlet called Jones's Sound by Baffin, also unexplored.\r\nThese two inlets, with their very British titles, Smith and Jones, are\r\nof exceeding interest. Jones's Sound may lead by a back way to\r\nMelville Island. South of Jones's Sound there is a wide break in the\r\nshore, a great sound, named by Baffin, Lancaster's, which Sir John\r\nRoss, in that first expedition, failed also to explore. Like our\r\ntransatlantic friends at the South Pole, he laid down a range of\r\nclouds as mountains, and considered the way impervious; so he came\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nParry went out next year, as a lieutenant, in command of his first and\r\nmost successful expedition. He sailed up Lancaster Sound, which was in\r\nthat year (1819) unusually clear of ice: and he is the discoverer\r\nwhose track we now follow in our Phantom Ship. The whole ground being\r\nnew, he had to name the points of country right and left of him. The\r\nway was broad and open, due west, a most prosperous beginning for a\r\nnorth-west passage. If this continued, he would soon reach Behring\r\nStrait. A broad channel to the right, directed, that is to say,\r\nsouthward, he entered on the Prince of Wales's birthday, and so called\r\nit the \"Prince Regent's Inlet.\" After exploring this for some miles,\r\nhe turned back to resume his western course, for still there was a\r\nbroad strait leading westward. This second part of Lancaster Sound, he\r\ncalled after the Secretary of the Admiralty who had so indefatigably\r\nlabored to promote the expeditions, Barrow's Strait. Then he came to a\r\nchannel, turning to the right or northward, and he named that\r\nWellington Channel. Then he had on his right hand ice, islands large\r\nand small, and intervening channels; on the left, ice, and a cape\r\nvisible, Cape Walker. At an island, named after the First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty Melville Island, the great frozen wilderness barred further\r\nprogress. There he wintered. On the coast of Melville Island they had\r\npassed the latitude of one hundred and ten degrees, and the men had\r\nbecome entitled to a royal bounty of five thousand pounds. This group\r\nof islands Parry called North Georgian, but they are usually called by\r\nhis own name, Parry Islands. This was the first European winter party\r\nin the Arctic circle. Its details are familiar enough. How the men cut\r\nin three days through ice seven inches thick, a canal two miles and a\r\nhalf long, and so brought the ships into safe harbor. How the genius\r\nof Parry equalled the occasion; how there was established a theatre\r\nand a _North Georgian Gazette_, to cheer the tediousness of a night\r\nwhich continued for two thousand hours. The dreary dazzling waste in\r\nwhich there was that little patch of life, the stars, the fog, the\r\nmoonlight, the glittering wonder of the northern lights, in which, as\r\nGreenlanders believe, souls of the wicked dance tormented, are\r\nfamiliar to us. The she-bear stays at home; but the he-bear hungers,\r\nand looks in vain for a stray seal or walrus--woe to the unarmed man\r\nwho meets him in his hungry mood! Wolves are abroad, and pretty white\r\narctic foxes. The reindeer have sought other pasture-ground. The\r\nthermometer runs down to more than sixty degrees below freezing, a\r\ntemperature tolerable in calm weather, but distressing in a wind. The\r\neye-piece of the telescope must be protected now with leather, for the\r\nskin is destroyed that comes in contact with cold metal. The voice at\r\na mile's distance can be heard distinctly. Happy the day when first\r\nthe sun is seen to graze the edge of the horizon; but summer must\r\ncome, and the heat of a constant day must accumulate, and summer wane,\r\nbefore the ice is melted. Then the ice cracks, like cannons\r\nover-charged, and moves with a loud grinding noise. But not yet is\r\nescape to be made with safety. After a detention of ten months, Parry\r\ngot free; but, in escaping, narrowly missed the destruction of both\r\nships, by their being \"nipped\" between the mighty mass and the\r\nunyielding shore. What animals are found on Melville Island, we may\r\njudge from the results of sport during ten months' detention. The\r\nIsland exceeds five thousand miles square, and yielded to the gun,\r\nthree musk oxen, twenty-four deer, sixty-eight bears, fifty-three\r\ngeese, fifty-nine ducks, and one hundred and forty-four patarmigans,\r\nweighing together three thousand seven hundred and sixty-six\r\npounds--not quite two ounces of meat per day to every man. Lichens,\r\nstunted grass, saxifrage, and a feeble willow, are the plants of\r\nMelville Island, but in sheltered nooks there are found sorrel, poppy,\r\nand a yellow butter-cup. Halos and double suns are very common\r\nconsequences of refraction in this quarter of the world. Franklin\r\nreturned from his first and most famous voyage with his men all safe\r\nand sound, except the loss of a few fingers, frost-bitten. We sail\r\nback only as far as Regent's Inlet, being bound for Behring Strait.\r\nThe reputation of Sir John Ross being clouded by the discontent\r\nexpressed against his first expedition, Mr. Felix Booth, a rich\r\ndistiller, provided seventeen thousand pounds to enable his friend to\r\nredeem his credit. Sir John accordingly, in 1829, went out in the\r\n\"Victory,\" provided with steam-machinery that did not answer well. He\r\nwas accompanied by Sir James Ross, his nephew. He it was who, on this\r\noccasion, first surveyed Regent's Inlet, down which we are now sailing\r\nwith our Phantom Ship. The coast on our right hand, westward, which\r\nParry saw, is called North Somerset, but farther south, where the\r\ninlet widens, the land is named Boothia Felix. Five years before this,\r\nParry, in his third voyage, had attempted to pass down Regent's Inlet,\r\nwhere among ice and storm, one of his ships, the \"Hecla,\" had been\r\ndriven violently ashore, and of necessity, abandoned. The stores had\r\nbeen removed, and Sir John was able now to replenish his own vessel\r\nfrom them. Rounding a point at the bottom of Prince Regent's Inlet, we\r\nfind Felix Harbor, where Sir John Ross wintered. His nephew made from\r\nthis point scientific explorations; discovered a strait, called after\r\nhim the Strait of James Ross, and on the northern shore of this\r\nstrait, on the main land of Boothia, planted the British flag on the\r\nNorthern Magnetic Pole. The ice broke up, so did the \"Victory;\" after\r\na hairbreadth escape, the party found a searching vessel, and arrived\r\nhome after an absence of four years and five months, Sir John Ross\r\nhaving lost his ship, and won his reputation. The friend in need was\r\nmade a baronet for his munificence; Sir John was reimbursed for all\r\nhis losses, and the crew liberally taken care of. Sir James Ross had a\r\nrod and flag signifying \"Magnetic Pole,\" given to him for a new crest,\r\nby the Heralds' College, for which he was no doubt greatly the better.\r\n\r\nWe have sailed northward to get into Hudson Strait, the high road into\r\nHudson Bay. Along the shore are Exquimaux in boats, extremely active,\r\nbut these filthy creatures we pass by; the Exquimaux in Hudson Strait\r\nare like the negroes of the coast, demoralized by intercourse with\r\nEuropean traders. These are not true pictures of the loving children\r\nof the north. Our \"Phantom\" floats on the wide waters of Hudson\r\nBay--the grave of its discoverer. Familiar as the story is of Henry\r\nHudson's fate, for John King's sake how gladly we repeat it. While\r\nsailing on the waters he discovered, in 1611, his men mutinied; the\r\nmutiny was aided by Henry Green, a prodigal, whom Hudson had\r\ngenerously shielded from ruin. Hudson, the master, and his son, with\r\nsix sick or disabled members of the crew, were driven from their\r\ncabins, forced into a little shallop, and committed helpless to the\r\nwater and the ice. But there was one stout man, John King, the\r\ncarpenter, who stepped into the boat, abjuring his companions, and\r\nchose rather to die than even passively be partaker in so foul a\r\ncrime. John King, we who live after, will remember you.\r\n\r\nHere on an island, Charlton Island, near our entrance to the bay, in\r\n1631, wintered poor Captain James with his wrecked crew. This is a\r\npoint outside the Arctic circle, but quite cold enough. Of nights,\r\nwith a good fire in the house they built, hoar frost covered their\r\nbeds, and the cook's water in a metal pan before the fire, was warm on\r\none side, and froze on the other. Here \"it snowed and froze extremely,\r\nat which time we, looking from the shore towards the ship, she\r\nappeared a piece of ice in the fashion of a ship, or a ship resembling\r\na piece of ice.\" Here the gunner, who had lost his leg, besought that,\r\n\"for the little time he had to live, he might drink sack altogether.\"\r\nHe died and was buried in the ice far from the vessel, but when\r\nafterwards two more were dead of scurvy, and the others, in a\r\nmiserable state, were working with faint hope about their shattered\r\nvessel, the gunner was found to have returned home to the old vessel;\r\nhis leg had penetrated through a porthole. They \"digged him clear out,\r\nand he was as free from noisomness,\" the record says, \"as when we\r\nfirst committed him to the sea. This alteration had the ice, and\r\nwater, and time, only wrought on him, that his flesh would slip up and\r\ndown upon his bones, like a glove on a man's hand. In the evening we\r\nburied him by the others.\" These worthy souls, laid up with the\r\nagonies of scurvy, knew that in action was their only hope; they\r\nforced their limbs to labor, among ice and water, every day. They set\r\nabout the building of a boat, but the hard frozen wood had broken all\r\ntheir axes, so they made shift with the pieces. To fell a tree, it was\r\nfirst requisite to light a fire around it, and the carpenter could\r\nonly labor with his wood over a fire, or else it was like stone under\r\nhis tools. Before the boat was made they buried the carpenter. The\r\ncaptain exhorted them to put their trust in God; \"His will be done. If\r\nit be our fortune to end our days here, we are as near Heaven as in\r\nEngland. They all protested to work to the utmost of their strength,\r\nand that they would refuse nothing that I should order them to do to\r\nthe utmost hazard of their lives. I thanked them all.\" Truly the North\r\nPole has its triumphs. If we took no account of the fields of trade\r\nopened by our Arctic explorers, if we thought nothing of the wants of\r\nscience in comparison with the lives lost in supplying them, is not\r\nthe loss of life a gain, which proves and tests the fortitude of noble\r\nhearts, and teaches us respect for human nature? All the lives that\r\nhave been lost among these Polar regions, are less in number than the\r\ndead upon a battle-field. The battle-field inflicted shame upon our\r\nrace--is it with shame that our hearts throb in following these Arctic\r\nheroes? March 31st, says Captain James, \"was very cold, with snow and\r\nhail, which pinched our sick men more than any time this year. This\r\nevening, being May eve, we returned late from our work to our house,\r\nand made a good fire, and chose ladies, and ceremoniously wore their\r\nnames in our caps, endeavoring to revive ourselves by any means. On\r\nthe 15th, I manured a little patch of ground that was bare of snow,\r\nand sowed it with pease, hoping to have some shortly to eat, for as\r\nyet we could see no green thing to comfort us.\" Those pease saved the\r\nparty; as they came up the young shoots were boiled and eaten, so\r\ntheir health began to mend, and they recovered from their scurvy.\r\nEventually, after other perils, they succeeded making their escape.\r\n\r\nA strait, called Sir Thomas Rowe's Welcome, leads due north out of\r\nHudson Bay, being parted by Southampton Island from the strait through\r\nwhich we entered. Its name is quaint, for so was its discoverer, Luke\r\nFox, a worthy man, addicted much to euphuism. Fox sailed from London\r\nin the same year in which James sailed from Bristol. They were rivals.\r\nMeeting in Davis Straits, Fox dined on board his friendly rival's\r\nvessel, which was very unfit for the service upon which it went. The\r\nsea washed over them and came into the cabin, so says Fox, \"sauce\r\nwould not have been wanted if there had been roast mutton.\" Luke Fox\r\nbeing ice-bound and in peril, writes, \"God thinks upon our\r\nimprisonment with a _supersedeas_;\" but he was a good and honorable\r\nman as well as euphuist. His \"Sir Thomas Rowe's Welcome,\" leads into\r\nFox Channel; our \"Phantom Ship\" is pushing through the welcome passes\r\non the left-hand Repulse Bay. This portion of the Arctic regions, with\r\nFox Channel, is extremely perilous. Here Captain Lyon, in the\r\n\"Griper,\" was thrown anchorless upon the mercy of a stormy sea, ice\r\ncrashing around him. One island in Fox Channel is called Mill Island,\r\nfrom the incessant grinding of great masses of ice collected there. In\r\nthe northern part of Fox Channel, on the western shore, is Melville\r\nPeninsula, where Parry wintered on his second voyage. Here let us go\r\nashore and see a little colony of Esquimaux.\r\n\r\nTheir huts are built of blocks of snow, and arched, having an ice pane\r\nfor a window. They construct their arched entrance and their\r\nhemispherical roof, on the true principles of architecture. Those wise\r\nmen, the Egyptians, made their arch by hewing the stones out of shape,\r\nthe Esquimaux have the true secret. Here they are, with little food in\r\nwinter and great appetites; devouring a whole walrus when they get it,\r\nand taking the chance of hunger for the next eight days--hungry or\r\nfull, for ever happy in their lot--here are the Esquimaux. They are\r\nwarmly clothed, each in a double suit of skins sewn neatly together.\r\nSome are singing, with good voices, too. Please them, and they\r\nstraightway dance; activity is good in a cold climate. Play to them on\r\nthe flute, or if you can sing well, sing, or turn a barrel-organ, they\r\nare mute, eager with wonder and delight; their love of music is\r\nintense. Give them a pencil, and, like children, they will draw. Teach\r\nthem, and they will learn, oblige them, and they will be grateful.\r\n\"Gentle and loving savages,\" one of our old worthies called them, and\r\nthe Portuguese were so much impressed with their teachable and gentle\r\nconduct, that a Venetian ambassador writes, \"His serene majesty\r\ncontemplates deriving great advantage from the country, not only on\r\naccount of the timber, of which he has occasion, but of the\r\ninhabitants, who are admirably calculated for labor, and are the best\r\nI have ever seen.\" The Esquimaux, of course, will learn vice, and in\r\nthe region visited by whale ships, vice enough has certainly been\r\ntaught him. Here are the dogs, who will eat old coats, or any thing;\r\nand, near the dwellings, here is a snow-bunting,--robin redbreast of\r\nthe Arctic lands. A party of our sailors once, on landing, took some\r\nsticks from a large heap, and uncovered the nest of a snow-bunting\r\nwith young, the bird flew to a little distance, but seeing that the\r\nmen sat down and harmed her not, continued to seek food and supply her\r\nlittle ones, with full faith in the good intentions of the party.\r\nCaptain Lyon found a child's grave partly uncovered, and a\r\nsnow-bunting had built its nest upon the infant's bosom.\r\n\r\nSailing round Melville Peninsula, we come into the gulf of Akkolee,\r\nthrough Fury and Hecla Straits, discovered by Parry. So we get back to\r\nthe bottom of Regent's Inlet, which we quitted a short time ago, and\r\nsailing in the neighborhood of the magnetic pole, we reach the estuary\r\nof Black's River, on the north-east coast of America. We pass then\r\nthrough a straight, discovered in 1839, by Dean and Simpson, still\r\ncoasting along the northern shore of America, on the Great Stinking\r\nLake, as Indians call this ocean. Boats, ice permitting, and our\r\n\"Phantom Ship,\" of course, can coast all the way to Behring Strait.\r\nThe whole coast has been explored by Sir John Franklin, Sir John\r\nRichardson, and Sir George Back, who have earned their knighthoods\r\nthrough great peril. As we pass Coronation Gulf--the scene of\r\nFranklin, Richardson, and Back's first exploration from the Coppermine\r\nRiver--we revert to the romantic story of their journey back, over a\r\nland of snow and frost, subsisting upon lichens, with companions\r\nstarved to death; where they plucked wild leaves for tea, and ate\r\ntheir shoes for supper; the tragedy by the river; the murder of poor\r\nHood, with a book of prayers in his hand; Franklin at Fort Enterprise,\r\nwith two companions at the point of death, himself gaunt, hollow-eyed,\r\nfeeding on pounded bones, raked from the dunghill; the arrival of Dr.\r\nRichardson and the brave sailor; their awful story of the cannibal\r\nMichel;--we revert to these things with a shudder. But we must\r\ncontinue on our route. The current still flows westward, bearing now\r\nlarge quantities of drift-wood, out of the Mackenzie River. At the\r\nname of Sir Alexander Mackenzie, also, we might pause, and talk over\r\nthe bold achievements of another arctic hero; but we pass on, by a\r\nrugged and inhospitable coast, unfit for vessels of large\r\ndraught,--pass the broad mouth of the Youcon, pass Point Barrow, Icy\r\nCape, and are in Behring Strait. Had we passed on, we should have\r\nfound the Russian Arctic coast line, traced out by a series of Russian\r\nexplorers; of whom the most illustrious--Baron Von Wrangell--states,\r\nthat beyond a certain distance to the northward, there is always found\r\nwhat he calls the _Polynja_ (open water.) This is the fact adduced by\r\nthose who adhere to the old fancy that there is a sea about the pole\r\nitself quite free from ice.\r\n\r\nWe pass through Behring Straits. Behring, a Dane by birth, but in the\r\nRussian service, died here in 1741, upon the scene of his discovery.\r\nHe and his crew, victims of scurvy, were unable to manage their vessel\r\nin a storm; and it was at length wrecked on a barren island, there,\r\nwhere \"want, nakedness, cold, sickness, impatience, and despair were\r\ntheir daily guests.\" Behring, his lieutenant, and the master died.\r\n\r\nNow we must put a girdle round the world, and do it with the speed of\r\nAriel. Here we are already in the heats of the equator. We can do no\r\nmore than remark, that if air and water are heated at the equator, and\r\nfrozen at the poles, there will be equilibrium destroyed, and\r\nconstant currents caused. And so it happens, so we get the prevailing\r\nwinds, and all the currents of the ocean. Of these, some of the uses,\r\nbut by no means all, are obvious. We urge our \"Phantom\" fleetly to the\r\nsouthern pole. Here, over the other hemisphere of the earth, there\r\nshines another hemisphere of heaven. The stars are changed; the\r\nsouthern cross, the Magellanic clouds, the \"coal-sack\" in the milky\r\nway, attract our notice. Now we are in the southern latitude that\r\ncorresponds to England in the north; nay, at a greater distance, from\r\nthe pole, we find Kerguelen's Land, emphatically called \"The Isle of\r\nDesolation.\" Icebergs float much further into the warm sea on this\r\nside of the equator, before they dissolve. The South Pole is evidently\r\na more thorough refrigerator than the North. Why is this? We shall\r\nsoon see. We push through pack-ice, and through floes and fields, by\r\nlofty bergs, by an island or two covered with penguins, until there\r\nlies before us a long range of mountains, nine or ten thousand feet in\r\nheight, and all clad in eternal snow. That is a portion of the\r\nSouthern Continent. Lieutenant Wilkes, in the American exploring\r\nexpedition, first discovered this, and mapped out some part of the\r\ncoast, putting a few clouds in likewise,--a mistake easily made by\r\nthose who omit to verify every foot of land. Sir James Ross, in his\r\nmost successful South Pole Expedition, during the years 1839-43,\r\nsailed over some of this land, and confirmed the rest. The Antarctic,\r\nas well as the Arctic honors he secured for England, by turning a\r\ncorner of the land, and sailing far southward, along an impenetrable\r\nicy barrier, to the latitude of seventy-eight degrees, nine minutes.\r\nIt is an elevated continent, with many lofty ranges. In the extreme\r\nsouthern point reached by the ships, a magnificent volcano was seen\r\nspouting fire and smoke out of the everlasting snow. This volcano,\r\ntwelve thousand four hundred feet high, was named Mount Erebus; for\r\nthe \"Erebus\" and \"Terror,\" now sought anxiously among the bays, and\r\nsounds, and creeks of the North Pole, then coasted by the solid\r\nice-walls of the south. Only as \"Phantoms\" can we cross this land and\r\nlive. These lofty mountain-ranges, cold to the marrow, these vast\r\nglaciers, and elevated plains of ice, no wonder that they cast a chill\r\nabout their neighborhood. Our very ghosts are cold, and the volcanoes\r\nonly make the frost colder by contrast. We descend upon the other\r\nside, take ship again, and float up the Atlantic, through the tropics.\r\nWe have been round the world now, and among the ice, and have not\r\ngrown much older since we started.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOther \"Phantoms\" are to be added to those thus described. Besides the\r\nexpeditions now in the ice regions, from England and America, one, and\r\nperhaps two more, have in the last two months started in the search\r\nfor Franklin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAME DE GENLIS AND MADAME DE STAEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis curious piece has recently appeared in the _Gazette de France_,\r\nand has excited much remark. It is given out to be the production of\r\nCharles X., when Monsieur, and was communicated to M. Neychens by the\r\nMarquis de la Roche Jacqueleine.\r\n\r\n\"Before the Revolution, I was but very slightly acquainted with Mme.\r\nde Genlis, her conduct during that disastrous period having not a\r\nlittle contributed to sink her in my estimation; and the publication\r\nof her novel, 'The Knights of the Swan' (the _first_ edition),\r\ncompleted my dislike to a person who had so cruelly aspersed the\r\ncharacter of the queen, my sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n\"On my return to France, I received a letter full of the most\r\npassionate expressions of loyalty from beginning to end; the missive\r\nbeing signed Comtesse de Genlis; but imagining this could be but a\r\n_plaisanterie_ of some intimate friend of my own, I paid no attention\r\nwhatever to it. However, in two or three days it was followed by a\r\nsecond epistle, complaining of my silence, and appealing to the great\r\nsacrifices the writer had made in the interest of my cause, as giving\r\nher a _right_ to my favorable attention. Talleyrand being present, I\r\nasked him if he could explain this enigma.\r\n\r\n\"'Nothing is easier,' replied he; 'Mme. de Genlis is unique. She has\r\nlost her own memory, and fancies others have experienced a similar\r\nbereavement.'\r\n\r\n\"'She speaks,' pursued I, 'of her virtues, her misfortunes, and\r\nNapoleon's persecutions.'\r\n\r\n\"'Hem! In 1789 her husband was quite ruined, so the events of that\r\nperiod took nothing from _him_; and as to the tyranny of Bonaparte, it\r\nconsisted, in the first place, of giving her a magnificent suite of\r\napartments in the Arsenal; and in the second place, granting her a\r\npension of six thousand francs a year, upon the sole condition of her\r\nkeeping him every month _au courant_ of the literature of the day.'\r\n\r\n\"'What shocking ferocity!' replied I, laughing; 'a case of infamous\r\ndespotism indeed. And this martyr to our cause asks to see me.'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes; and pray let your royal highness grant her an audience, were it\r\nonly for once: I assure you she is most amusing.'\r\n\r\n\"I followed the advice of M. de Talleyrand, and accorded to the lady\r\nthe permission she so pathetically demanded. The evening before she\r\nwas to present herself, however, came a third missive, recommending a\r\ncertain Casimir, the _phenix_ of the _epoque_, and several other\r\npersons besides; all, according to Mme. de Genlis, particularly\r\ncelebrated people; and the postscript to this effusion prepared me\r\nalso beforehand for the request she intended to make, of being\r\nappointed governess to the children of my son, the Duc de Berry, who\r\nwas at that time not even married.\r\n\r\n\"Just at this period it so happened that I was besieged by more than a\r\ndozen persons of every rank in regard to Mme. de Stael, formerly\r\nexiled by Bonaparte, and who had rushed to Paris without taking\r\nbreath, fully persuaded every one there, and throughout all France,\r\nwas impatient to see her again. Mme. de Stael had a double view in\r\nthus introducing herself to me; namely, to direct my proceedings\r\nentirely, and to obtain payment of the two million francs deposited in\r\nthe treasury by her father during his ministry. I confess I was not\r\nprepossessed in favor of Mme. de Stael, for she also, in 1789, had\r\nmanifested so much hatred towards the Bourbons, that I thought all she\r\ncould possibly look to from us, was the liberty of living in Paris\r\nunmolested: but I little knew her. She, on her side, imagined we ought\r\nto be grateful to her for having quarrelled with Bonaparte--her own\r\npride being, in fact, the sole cause of the rupture.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Fontanes and M. de Chateaubriand were the first who mentioned\r\nher to me; and to the importance with which they treated the matter, I\r\nanswered, laughing, 'So, Mme. la Baronne de Stael is then a supreme\r\npower?'\r\n\r\n\"'Indeed she is, and it might have very unfavorable effects did your\r\nroyal highness overlook her: for what she asserts, every one believes,\r\nand then--she has suffered _so_ much!'\r\n\r\n\"'Very likely; but what did she make my poor sister-in-law, the queen,\r\nsuffer? Do you think I can forget the abominable things she said, the\r\nfalsehoods she told? and was it not in consequence of them, and the\r\npublic's belief of them, that she owed the possibility of the\r\nambassadress of Sweden's being able to dare insult that unfortunate\r\nprincess in her very palace?'\r\n\r\n\"Mme. de Stael's envoys, who manifested some confusion at the fidelity\r\nof my memory, implored me to forget the past, think only of the\r\nfuture, and remember that the genius of Mme. de Stael, whose\r\nreputation was European, might be of the utmost advantage, or the\r\nreverse. Tired of disputing I yielded; consented to receive this\r\n_femme celebre_, as they all called her, and fixed for her reception\r\nthe same day I had notified to Mme. de Genlis.\r\n\r\n\"My brother has said, 'Punctuality is the politeness of kings'--words\r\nas true and just as they are happily expressed; and the princes of my\r\nfamily have never been found wanting in good manners; so I was in my\r\nstudy waiting when Mme. de Genlis was announced. I was astonished at\r\nthe sight of a long, dry woman, with a swarthy complexion, dressed in\r\na printed cotton gown, any thing but clean, and a shawl covered with\r\ndust, her habit-shirt, her hair even bearing marks of great\r\nnegligence. I had read her works, and remembering all she said about\r\nneatness, and cleanliness, and proper attention to one's dress, I\r\nthought she added another to the many who fail to add example to their\r\nprecepts. While making these reflections, Mme. de Genlis was firing\r\noff a volley of curtsies; and upon finishing what she deemed the\r\nrequisite number, she pulled out of a great huge bag four manuscripts\r\nof enormous dimensions.\r\n\r\n\"'I bring,' commenced the lady, 'to your royal highness what will\r\namply repay any kindness you may show to me--No. 1 is a plan of\r\nconduct, and the project of a constitution; No. 2 contains a\r\ncollection of speeches in answer to those likely to be addressed to\r\nMonsieur; No. 3, addresses and letters proper to send to foreign\r\npowers, the provinces, &c., and in No. 4, Monsieur will find a plan of\r\neducation, the only one proper to be persued by royalty, in reading\r\nwhich, your royal highness will feel as convinced of the extent of my\r\nacquirements as of the purity of my loyalty.'\r\n\r\n\"Many in my place might have been angry; but, on the contrary, I\r\nthanked her with an air of polite sincerity for the treasures she was\r\nso obliging as to confide to me, and then condoled with her upon the\r\nmisfortunes she had endured under the tyranny of Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n\"'Alas! Monsieur, this abominable despot dared to make a mere\r\nplaything of _me_! and yet I strove, by wise advice, to guide him\r\nright, and teach him to regulate his conduct properly: but he would\r\nnot be led. I even offered to mediate between him and the pope, but he\r\ndid not even so much as answer me upon this subject; although (being a\r\nmost profound theologian) I could have smoothed almost all\r\ndifficulties when the Concordat was in question.'\r\n\r\n\"This last piece of pretension was almost too much for my gravity.\r\nHowever, I applauded the zeal of this new mother of the church, and\r\nwas going to put an end to the interview, when it came into my head to\r\nask her if she was well acquainted with Mme. de Stael.\r\n\r\n\"'God forbid!' cried she, making a sign of the cross: 'I have no\r\nacquaintance with _such people_; and I but do my duty in warning those\r\nwho have not perused the works of that lady, to bear in mind that they\r\nare written in the worst possible taste, and are also extremely\r\nimmoral. Let your royal highness turn your thoughts from such books;\r\nyou will find in _mine_ all that is necessary to know. I suppose\r\nMonsieur has not yet seen _Little Necker_?'\r\n\r\n\"'Mme. la Baronne de Stael Holstein has asked for an audience, and I\r\neven suspect she may be already arrived at the Tuileries.'\r\n\r\n\"'Let your royal highness beware of this woman! See in her the\r\nimplacable enemy of the Bourbons, and in me their most devoted slave.'\r\n\r\n\"This new proof of the want of memory in Madame de Genlis amused me as\r\nmuch as the other absurdities she had favored me with; and I was in\r\nthe act of making her the ordinary salutations of adieu, when I\r\nobserved her blush purple, and her proud rival entered.\r\n\r\n\"The two ladies exchanged a haughty bow, and the comedy, which had\r\njust finished with the departure of Mme. de Genlis, recommenced under\r\na different form when Mme. de Stael appeared on the stage. The\r\nbaroness was dressed, not certainly dirty, like the countess, but\r\nquite as absurdly. She wore a red satin gown, embroidered with flowers\r\nof gold and silk; a profusion of diamonds; rings enough to stock a\r\npawnbroker's shop; and, I must add, that I never before saw so low a\r\ncut corsage display less inviting charms. Upon her head was a huge\r\nturban, constructed on the pattern of that worn by the Cumean sybil,\r\nwhich put a finishing stroke to a costume so little in harmony with\r\nher style of face. I scarcely understand how a woman of genius _can_\r\nhave such a false, vulgar taste. Mme. de Stael began by apologizing\r\nfor occupying a few moments which she doubted not I should have\r\npreferred giving to Mme. de Genlis. 'She is one of the illustrations\r\nof the day,' observed she, with a sneering smile--'a colossus of\r\nreligious faith, and represents in her person, she fancies, all the\r\nliterature of the age. Ah! ah! Monsieur, in the hands of _such people_\r\nthe world would soon retrograde; while it should, on the contrary, be\r\nimpelled forward, and your royal highness be the first to put yourself\r\nat the head of this great movement. To you should belong the glory of\r\ngiving the impulse, guided by _my experience_.'\r\n\r\n\"'Come,' thought I, 'here is another going to plague me with plans of\r\nconduct, and constitutions, and reforms, which I am to persuade the\r\nking my brother to adopt. It seems to be an insanity in France this\r\ncomposing of new constitutions.' While I was making these reflections,\r\nmadame had time to give utterance to a thousand fine phrases, every\r\none more sublime than the preceding. However, to put an end to them, I\r\nasked her if there was any thing she wished to demand.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, dear!--oh yes, prince!' replied the lady in an indifferent tone.\r\n'A mere trifle--less than nothing--two millions, without counting the\r\ninterest at five per cent. But these are matters I leave entirely to\r\nmy men of business, being for my own part much more absorbed in\r\npolitics and the science of government.'\r\n\r\n\"'Alas! madame, the king has arrived in France with his mind made up\r\nupon most subjects, the fruit of twenty-five years' meditation; and I\r\nfear he is not likely to profit by your good intentions.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then so much the worse for him and for France! All the world knows\r\nwhat it cost Bonaparte his refusing to follow my advice, and pay me my\r\ntwo millions. I have studied the Revolution profoundly, followed it\r\nthrough all its phases, and I flatter myself I am the only pilot who\r\ncan hold with one hand the rudder of the state, if at least I have\r\nBenjamin for steersman.'\r\n\r\n\"'Benjamin! Benjamin--who?' asked I in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"'It would give me the deepest distress,' replied she, 'to think that\r\nthe name of M. le Baron de Rebecque Benjamin de Constant has never\r\nreached the ears of your royal highness. One of his ancestors saved\r\nthe life of Henry Quatre. Devoted to the descendants of this good\r\nking, he is ready to serve them; and among several _constitutions_ he\r\nhas in his portfolio, you will probably find one with annotations and\r\nreflections by myself, which will suit you. Adopt it, and choose\r\nBenjamin Constant to carry the idea out.'\r\n\r\n\"It seemed like a thing resolved--an event decided upon--this proposal\r\nof inventing a constitution for us. I kept as long as I could upon the\r\ndefensive, but Mme. de Stael, carried away by her zeal and her\r\nenthusiasm, instead of speaking of what personally concerned herself,\r\nknocked me about with arguments, and crushed me under threats and\r\nmenaces; so, tired to death of entertaining, instead of a clever,\r\nhumble woman, a roaring politician in petticoats, I finished the\r\naudience, leaving her as little satisfied as myself with the\r\ninterview. Mme. de Genlis was ten times less disagreeable, and twenty\r\ntimes more amusing.\r\n\r\n\"That same evening I had M. le Prince de Talleyrand with me, and I was\r\nconfounded by hearing him say, 'So, your royal highness has made Mme.\r\nde Stael completely quarrel with me now?'\r\n\r\n\"'Me! I never so much as pronounced your name.'\r\n\r\n\"'Notwithstanding that, she is convinced that I am the person who\r\nprevents your royal highness from employing her in your political\r\nrelations, and that I am jealous of Benjamin Constant. She is resolved\r\non revenge.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ha, ha!--and what can she do?'\r\n\r\n\"'A very great deal of mischief, Monseigneur. She has numerous\r\npartisans; and if she declares herself Bonapartiste, we must look to\r\nourselves.'\r\n\r\n\"'That _would_ be curious.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, I shall take upon myself to prevent her going so far; but she\r\nwill be Royalist no longer, and we shall suffer from that.'\r\n\r\n\"At this time I had not the remotest idea of what a mere man, still\r\nless a mere woman, could do in France: but now I understand it\r\nperfectly, and if Mme. de Stael was living--Heaven pardon me!--I would\r\nstrike up a flirtation with her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Chambers's Edinburgh Journal.\r\n\r\nTHE SMUGGLER MALGRE LUI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no more singular anomaly in the history of the human\r\nmind than the very different light in which a fraud is viewed\r\naccording to the circumstances in which it is practised. The singular\r\nrevelations made to the Chancellor of the Exchequer by a late\r\ndeputation will probably be fresh in the remembrance of most of our\r\nreaders. Even the learned gentleman himself could hardly maintain his\r\nprofessional gravity when informed of the ingenious contrivances\r\nadopted for defrauding the revenue. Advertisements floating through\r\nthe air attached to balloons, French gloves making their way into the\r\nkingdom in separate detachments of right and left hands, mutilated\r\nclocks travelling without their wheels--such were some of the divers\r\nmodes by which the law was declared to be evaded, and the custom-house\r\nofficers baffled. We are by no means disposed either to think or speak\r\nwith levity of this system of things. However much a man may succeed\r\nin reconciling any fraud to his own conscience, or however leniently\r\nit may be viewed by his fellow-men, it will yet assuredly help to\r\ndegrade his moral nature, and its repetition will slowly, but surely,\r\ndeaden the silent monitor within his breast. All we affirm is the\r\nwell-known fact, that laws are in most cases ineffective, except in so\r\nfar as they harmonize with the innate moral convictions of mankind;\r\nand that many a man who would not for worlds cheat his next door\r\nneighbor of a penny, will own without a blush, and perhaps even with a\r\nsmile of triumph, that he has cheated the government of thousands! It\r\nis not often, however, that so daring and successful a stroke of this\r\nnature is effected as that which we find related of a celebrated Swiss\r\njeweller, who actually succeeded in making the French director-general\r\nof the customs act the part of a smuggler!\r\n\r\nGeneva, as must be well known to all our readers, supplies half Europe\r\nwith her watches and her jewelry. Three thousand workmen are kept in\r\ncontinual employment by her master goldsmiths; while seventy-five\r\nthousand ounces of gold, and fifty thousand marks of silver, annually\r\nchange their form, and multiply their value beneath their skilful\r\nhands! The most fashionable jeweller's shop in Geneva is\r\nunquestionably that of Beautte; his trinkets are those which beyond\r\nall others excite the longing of the Parisian ladies. A high duty is\r\ncharged upon these in crossing the French frontier; but, in\r\nconsideration of a brokerage of five per cent., M. Beautte undertakes\r\nto forward them safely to their destination through contraband\r\nchannels; and the bargain between the buyer and seller is concluded\r\nwith this condition as openly appended and avowed as if there were no\r\nsuch personages as custom-house officers in the world.\r\n\r\nAll this went on smoothly for some years with M. Beautte; but at\r\nlength it so happened that M. le Comte de Saint-Cricq, a gentleman of\r\nmuch ability and vigilance was appointed director-general of the\r\ncustoms. He heard so much of the skill evinced by M. Beautte in\r\neluding the vigilance of his agents, that he resolved personally to\r\ninvestigate the matter, and prove for himself the truth of the\r\nreports. He consequently repaired to Geneva, presented himself at M.\r\nBeautte's shop, and purchased thirty thousand francs' worth of\r\njewelry, on the express condition that they should be transmitted to\r\nhim free of duty on his return to Paris. M. Beautte accepted the\r\nproposed condition with the air of a man who was perfectly accustomed\r\nto arrangements of this description. He, however, presented for\r\nsignature to M. de Saint-Cricq a private deed, by which the purchaser\r\npledged himself to pay the customary five per cent. _smuggling dues_,\r\nin addition to the thirty thousand francs' purchase-money.\r\n\r\nM. de Saint-Cricq smiled, and taking the pen from the jeweller's hand,\r\naffixed to the deed the following signature--\"L. de Saint-Cricq,\r\nDirector-General of the Customs in France.\" He then handed the\r\ndocument back to M. Beautte, who merely glanced at the signature, and\r\nreplied with a courteous bow--\r\n\r\n\"_Monsieur le Directeur des Douanes_, I shall take care that the\r\narticles which you have done me the honor of purchasing shall be\r\nhanded to you in Paris directly after your arrival.\" M. de\r\nSaint-Cricq, piqued by the man's cool daring and apparent defiance of\r\nhis authority and professional skill, immediately ordered post-horses,\r\nand without the delay of a single hour set out with all speed on the\r\nroad to Paris.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the frontier, the Director-General made himself known to\r\nthe _employes_ who came forward to examine his carriage--informed the\r\nchief officer of the incident which had just occurred, and begged of\r\nhim to keep up the strictest surveillance along the whole of the\r\nfrontier line, as he felt it to be a matter of the utmost importance\r\nto place some check upon the wholesale system of fraud which had for\r\nsome years past been practised upon the revenue by the Geneva\r\njewellers. He also promised a gratuity of fifty louis-d'ors to\r\nwhichever of the _employes_ should be so fortunate as to seize the\r\nprohibited jewels--a promise which had the effect of keeping every\r\nofficer on the line wide awake, and in a state of full activity,\r\nduring the three succeeding days.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile M. de Saint-Cricq reached Paris, alighted at his own\r\nresidence, and after having embraced his wife and children, and passed\r\na few moments in their society, retired to his dressing-room, for the\r\npurpose of laying aside his travelling costume. The first thing which\r\narrested his attention when he entered the apartment was a very\r\nelegant looking casket, which stood upon the mantelpiece, and which he\r\ndid not remember to have ever before seen. He approached to examine\r\nit; his name was on the lid; it was addressed in full to \"M. le Comte\r\nde Saint-Cricq, Director-General of Customs.\" He accordingly opened it\r\nwithout hesitation, and his surprise and dismay may be conceived when,\r\non examining the contents, he recognized at once the beautiful\r\ntrinkets he had so recently purchased in Geneva!\r\n\r\nThe count rung for his valet, and inquired from him whether he could\r\nthrow any light upon this mysterious occurrence. The valet looked\r\nsurprised, and replied, that on opening his master's portmanteau, the\r\ncasket in question was one of the first articles which presented\r\nitself to his sight, and its elegant form and elaborate workmanship\r\nhaving led him to suppose it contained articles of value, he had\r\ncarefully laid it aside upon the mantelpiece. The count, who had full\r\nconfidence in his valet, and felt assured that he was in no way\r\nconcerned in the matter, derived but little satisfaction from this\r\naccount, which only served to throw a fresh veil of mystery over the\r\ntransaction; and it was only some time afterwards, and after long\r\ninvestigation, that he succeeded in discovering the real facts of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nBeautte, the jeweller, had a secret understanding with one of the\r\nservants of the hotel at which the Comte de Saint-Cricq lodged in\r\nGeneva. This man, taking advantage of the hurried preparations for the\r\ncount's departure, contrived to slip the casket unperceived into one\r\nof his portmanteaus, and the ingenious jeweller had thus succeeded in\r\nmaking the Director-General of Customs one of the most successful\r\n_smugglers_ in the kingdom!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE HISTORY OF AGNES SOREL.\r\n\r\nBY R. H. HORNE, AUTHOR OF \"ORION,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnes Sorel was born in 1409, at the village of Fromenteau, in\r\nTouraine. Her father was the Seigneur de St. Gerand, a gentleman\r\nattached to the house of the Count de Clermont. At the age of fifteen,\r\nshe was placed as maid of honor to Isabel of Lorraine, duchess of\r\nAnjou, and accompanied this princess when she went to Paris, in 1431.\r\n\r\nAt this period, Agnes Sorel was considered to be the most beautiful\r\nwoman of her day. Her conversation and wit were equal to her beauty.\r\nIn the \"Histoire des Favorites\" she is said to have been noble-minded,\r\nfull of generosity, with sweetness of manners, and sincerity of heart.\r\nThe same writer adds that every body fell in love with her, from the\r\nking to the humblest officers. Charles VII. became passionately\r\nattached to her; and in order to insure her constant presence at\r\ncourt, he placed her as maid of honor to the queen. The amour was\r\nconducted with secrecy; but the fact became manifest by the favors\r\nwhich the king lavished upon the relations of Agnes, while she herself\r\nlived in great magnificence amidst a very poor court. She was fond of\r\nsplendor, and has been quaintly described by Monstrelet as \"having\r\nenjoyed all the pleasures of life, in wearing rich clothes, furred\r\nrobes, and golden chains of precious stones, and whatever else she\r\ndesired.\" When she visited Paris, in attendance upon the queen, the\r\nsplendor and expense of Agnes were so excessive that the people\r\nmurmured greatly; whereupon the proud beauty exclaimed against the\r\nParisians as churls.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that the English were actually in possession of a\r\ngreat part of France, it was in vain that the queen (Mary of Anjou)\r\nendeavored to rouse her husband from his lethargy. That the king was\r\nnot deficient in energy and physical courage, is evident from the\r\nmanner in which he signalized himself on various occasions. At the\r\nsiege of Montereau in 1437, (according to the Chronicle de Charles\r\nVII. par M. Alain Chartier, Nevers, 1594,) he rushed to the assault,\r\nnow thrusting with the lance, now assisting the artillery, now\r\nsuperintending the various military engines for heaving masses of\r\nstone or wood; but during the period above-mentioned he was lost to\r\nall sense of royal glory, and had given himself up entirely to hunting\r\nand all sorts of pleasures.\r\n\r\nHe was recalled by Agnes to a sense of what was due to his kingdom.\r\nShe told him, one day, says Brantoine, that when she was a girl, an\r\nastrologer had predicted that she would be loved by one of the most\r\nvaliant kings of Christendom; that when His Majesty Charles VII. had\r\ndone her this honor, she thought, of course, he was the valiant king\r\nwho had been predicted; but now, finding he was so weak, and had so\r\nlittle care as to what became of himself and his affairs, she saw that\r\nshe had made a mistake, and that this valiant prince could not be\r\nCharles, but the King of England. Saying these words, Agnes rose, and\r\nbowing reverentially to the king, asked leave to retire to the court\r\nof the English king, since the prophecy pointed at him. \"Charles,\" she\r\nsaid, \"was about to lose his crown, and Henry to unite it to his.\" By\r\nthis rebuke the king was much affected. He gave up his hunting, left\r\nhis gardens for the field of battle, and succeeded in driving the\r\nEnglish out of France. This circumstance occasioned Francis I. to make\r\nthe following verses, which, it is said, he wrote under a portrait of\r\nAgnes:--\r\n\r\n    \"Plus de louange et d'honneur tu merite,\r\n    La cause etant de France recouvrer,\r\n    Que ce que peut dedans un cloitre ouvrer,\r\n    Close nonnain, ou bien devol hermite.\"\r\n\r\nThe king lavished gifts and honors upon Agnes. He built a chateau for\r\nher at Loches; he gave her, besides the comte de Penthievre, in\r\nBretagne, the lordships of Roche Serviere, of Issoudun, in Berri, and\r\nthe Chateau de Beaute, at the extremity of the wood of Vincennes, that\r\nshe might be, as he said, \"in deed and in name the Queen of Beauty.\"\r\nIt is believed that she never made a bad use of her influence with the\r\nking for any political purposes or unkind private feelings;\r\nnevertheless, the Dauphin (afterwards Louis XI.) conceived an\r\nimplacable jealousy against her, and carried his resentment so far, on\r\none occasion, as to give her a blow.\r\n\r\nShe retired, in 1445, to Loches, and for nearly five years declined\r\nappearing at court; but the king's love for her still continued, and\r\nhe took many journeys into Touraine to visit her. But eventually the\r\nqueen, who had never forgotten her noble counsels to the king, which\r\nhad roused him from his lethargy, persuaded her to return to court.\r\n\r\nThe queen appears to have felt no jealousy, but to have had a regard\r\nfor her. It seems, also, that Agnes had become very popular, partly\r\nfrom her beauty and wit, partly because she was considered in a great\r\nmeasure, to have saved France, and partly because she distributed\r\nlarge sums in alms to the poor, and to repair decayed churches.\r\n\r\nAfter the taking of Rouen, and the entire expulsion of the English\r\nfrom France, the king took up his winter-quarters in the Abbey of\r\nJumiege. Agnes hastened to the Chateau de Masnal la Belle, a league\r\ndistant from this abbey, for the purpose of warning the king of a\r\nconspiracy. The king only laughed at the intelligence; but the death\r\nof Agnes Sorel, which immediately followed, gives some grounds for\r\ncrediting the truth of the information which she communicated. At this\r\nplace Agnes, still beautiful, and in perfect health, was suddenly\r\nattacked by a dysentery which carried her off. It is believed that she\r\nwas poisoned. Some affirm that it was effected by direction of the\r\nDauphin; others accuse Jacques Coeur, the king's goldsmith (as the\r\nmaster of the treasury was then called), and others attribute it to\r\nfemale jealousy.\r\n\r\nThe account given of her death by Monstrelet is to the following\r\neffect: Agnes was suddenly attacked by a dysentery which could not be\r\ncured. She lingered long, and employed the time in prayer and\r\nrepentance; she often, as he relates, called upon Mary Magdalen, who\r\nhad also been a sinner, and upon God and the blessed Virgin for aid.\r\nAfter receiving the sacrament, she desired the book of prayers to be\r\nbrought her, in which she had written with her own hand the verses of\r\nSt. Barnard, and these she repeated. She then made many gifts, which\r\nwere put down in writing: and these, including alms and the payment of\r\nher servants, amounted to 60,000 crowns. The fair Agnes, the once\r\nproud beauty, perceiving her end approaching, and now feeling a\r\ndisgust to life proportioned to the fulness of her past enjoyment of\r\nall its gayeties, vanities, and pleasures, said to the Lord de la\r\nTremouille and others, and in the presence of all her damsels, that\r\nour insecure and worldly life was but a foul ordure. She then\r\nrequested her confessor to give her absolution, according to a form\r\nshe herself dictated, with which he complied. After this, she uttered\r\na loud shriek, and gave up the ghost. She died on Monday, the 9th day\r\nof February, 1449, about six o'clock in the afternoon, in the fortieth\r\nyear of her age.\r\n\r\nThis account, though bearing every appearance of probability, is yet\r\nopen to some doubts, from the manifestation of a tendency, on the part\r\nof Monstrelet, to give a coloring to the event, and to the character\r\nof Agnes Sorel. He even attempts to throw a doubt upon her having been\r\nthe king's mistress, treating the fact as a mere scandal. He says that\r\nthe affection of the king was attributable to her good sense, her wit,\r\nher agreeable manners, and gayety, quite as much as to her beauty.\r\nThis was, no doubt, the case; but it hardly helps the argument of the\r\nhistorian. Monstrelet finds it difficult, however, to dispose of the\r\nchildren that she had by the king: he admits that Agnes had a daughter\r\nwhich she said was the king's, but that he denied it. The compilation\r\nby Denys Codefroy takes the same view, but nearly the whole account is\r\ncopied verbatim from Monstrelet, without acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nThe heart and intestines of Agnes were buried at Jumiege. Her body was\r\nplaced in the centre of the choir of the collegiate church of the\r\nChateau de Loches, which she had greatly enriched.\r\n\r\nHer tomb was in existence at Loches, in 1792. It was of black marble.\r\nThe figure of Agnes was in white marble; her head resting upon a\r\nlozenge, supported by angels, and two lambs were at her feet.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the life of Agnes Sorel in the \"Biographie Universelle,\"\r\nhaving access to printed books and MSS. of French history which are\r\nnot in the public libraries of this country, the following statements\r\nare taken from that work: the writer does not give his authorities.\r\n\r\nThe canons of the church pretended to be scandalized at having the\r\ntomb of Agnes placed in their choir, and begged permission of Louis\r\nXI. to have it removed. \"I consent,\" replied the king, \"provided you\r\ngive up all you have received from her bounty.\"\r\n\r\nThe poets of the day were profuse in their praises of the memory of\r\nAgnes. One of the most memorable of these is a poem by Baif, printed\r\nat Paris in 1573. In 1789 the library of the chapter of Loches\r\npossessed a manuscript containing nearly a thousand Latin sonnets in\r\npraise of Agnes, all acrostics, and made by a canon of that city.\r\n\r\nA marble bust of her was long preserved at the Chateau de Chinon, and\r\nis now placed in the Museum des Augustins.\r\n\r\nAgnes Sorel had three daughters by Charles VII., who all received\r\ndowries, and were married at the expense of the crown. They received\r\nthe title of daughters of France, the name given at that time to the\r\nnatural daughters of the kings. An account of the noble families into\r\nwhich they married, together with the honors bestowed upon the brother\r\nof Agnes, will be found in Moreri's \"Dictionnaire Historique.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the London Examiner.\r\n\r\nPROSPECTS OF AFRICAN COLONIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrica has never been propitious to European settlement or\r\ncolonization, but quite the contrary. The last founded state of the\r\nAnglo-American Union, of about two years' growth, is alone, at this\r\nmoment, worth more than all that has been effected by the European\r\nrace in Africa in two-and-twenty centuries. The most respectable\r\nproduct of African colonization is a Cape boor, and this is certainly\r\nnot a finished specimen of humanity. Assuredly, for the last three\r\nhundred years, Africa has done nothing for the nations of Europe but\r\nseduce them into crime, folly, and extravagance.\r\n\r\nThe Romans were the first European settlers in Africa; it was at their\r\nvery door, and they held it for eight centuries. Now, there is not\r\nleft in it hardly a trace of Roman civilization; certainly fewer, at\r\nall events, than the Arabs have left in Spain. The Vandal occupation\r\nof Mediterranean Africa lasted only half a century. We should not have\r\nknown that Vandals had ever set their feet on the Continent but for\r\nthe written records of civilized men. There is nothing Vandal there,\r\nunless Vandalism in the abstract. The Dutch came next, in order of\r\ntime, in another portion of Africa, and we have already alluded to the\r\nindistinct \"spoor\" which they have left behind them after an\r\noccupation of a hundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nThe English have settled in two different quarters of the African\r\ncontinent, one of them within eight degrees of the equatorial line,\r\nand the other some thirty-four south of it. The first costs us civil\r\nestablishments, forts, garrisons, and squadrons included (for out of\r\nAfrica and its people comes the supposed necessity for the squadron),\r\na good million a year. The most valuable article we get from tropical\r\nAfrica is the oil of a certain palm, which contributes largely towards\r\nan excise duty of about a million and a half a year, levied on what\r\nhas been justly called a second necessary of life--to wit, soap.\r\n\r\nWe have been in possession of the southern promontory of Africa for\r\nabove fifty years. In this time, besides its conquest twice over from\r\na European power, and in addition to fleets and armies, it has cost\r\nus, in mere self-defence against savages, three million pounds, while\r\nat this moment we are engaged in the same kind of defence, with the\r\ntolerable certainty of incurring another million. No one will venture\r\nto say that this sum alone does not far exceed the value of the fee\r\nsimple and sovereignty of the southern promontory of Africa. What we\r\nget from it consists chiefly in some purgative aloes, a little\r\nindifferent wool, and a good deal of execrable wine, on the\r\nimportation of which we pay a virtual bounty! As for _our subjects_ in\r\nthis part of the African continent, they amount to about two hundred\r\nthousand, and are composed of Anglo-Saxons, Dutch, Malays, Hottentots,\r\nBushmen, Gaikas, Tambookies, Amagarkas, Zulas, and Amazulas, speaking\r\na very Babel of African, Asiatic, and European tongues, perilous to\r\ndelicate organic structures even to listen to.\r\n\r\nNow for French African colonization. If we have not been very wise\r\nourselves, our neighbors, who have never been eminently happy in their\r\nattempts at colonization, have been much less so. They have been in\r\npossession of an immense territory in Algeria for twenty years, and\r\nhave now about fifty thousand colonists there, with an army which has\r\ngenerally not been less than one hundred thousand, so that every\r\ncolonist requires two soldiers to keep his throat from being cut, and\r\nhis property from being robbed or stolen. This is about ten times the\r\nregular army that protects twenty-eight millions of Anglo-Americans\r\nfrom nearly all the savages of North America. The local revenue of\r\nAlgeria is half a million sterling; but the annual cost of the\r\nexperiment to France amounts to eight times as much as the revenue;\r\nand it has been computed that the whole charge to the French nation,\r\nfrom first to last (it goes on at the same rate), has been sixty\r\nmillion pounds. This is without exception the most monstrous attempt\r\nat colonization that has ever been made by man. If war should\r\nunfortunately arise with any maritime power, the matter will be still\r\nworse. At least one hundred thousand of the flower of the French army\r\nwill then be worse than lost to France. For, pent up as it will be in\r\na narrow strip of eighty miles broad along the shore of the\r\nMediterranean, it may be blockaded from the sea by any superior naval\r\npower; and assuredly will be so, from the side of the desert, by a\r\nnative one. To hold Algeria is to cripple France.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the cause of the fatality which has thus ever attended\r\nAfrican colonization by Europeans? In tropical Africa, the heat and\r\ninsalubrity, and consequently the total unfitness for European life,\r\nare causes quite sufficient to account for the failure; and the\r\nfailure has been eminent with French, Dutch, English, and Danes. But\r\nthis will not account for want of success in temperate Africa, whether\r\nbeyond the northern or southern tropic. The climate of this last,\r\nespecially, is very good; and that of the first being nearly the same\r\nas their own, ought not to be hurtful to the constitutions of southern\r\nEuropeans.\r\n\r\nDrought, and the intermixture of deserts and wastes of sand with\r\nfertile lands, after the manner of a chess-board, without the\r\nregularity, is, of course, unpropitious to colonization, but cannot\r\nprevent its advancement, as we see by the progress of our Australian\r\ncolonies. These causes, however, combined with the character of the\r\nnative or congenial inhabitants of the country, have been quite\r\nsufficient to prove insuperable obstacles to a prosperous\r\ncolonization. A nomad and wandering population has in fact been\r\ngenerated, incapable either of advancement or amalgamation, having\r\njust a sufficient knowledge of the arts to be dangerous neighbors, not\r\ncapable of being driven to a distance from the settlers, nor likely to\r\nbe destroyed by gunpowder or brandy. The lion and shepherd recede\r\nbefore the white man in southern Africa, but not the Caffir.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitant of northern Africa, whether Arabian or Numidian, is, in\r\nrelation to an European colony, only a more formidable Caffir, from\r\ngreater numbers and superior skill. Heretofore, a garrison of five\r\nthousand men at the most has been sufficient to protect the Cape\r\ncolony, although six thousand miles distant from England. The\r\nterritory of Algeria, of about the same extent, requires about twenty\r\ntimes that number, although within a day's sail of France. Arab and\r\nNumidian seem to be alike untamable both by position and by race. The\r\nArabs (and it shows they were capable of better things) were a\r\ncivilized and industrious people while in the fair regions of Spain;\r\ndriven from it, they have degenerated into little more than predatory\r\nshepherds, or freebooters; but they are only the more formidable to\r\ncivilized men on this very account.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, will be the fate of the French and English colonies in\r\ntemperate Africa? We confess we can hardly venture to predict.\r\nAssuredly, neither north nor south Africa will ever give birth to a\r\ngreat or flourishing community, such as North America has done, and as\r\nAustralia and New Zealand will certainly do. The Caffirs may possibly\r\nbe driven to a distance, after a long course of trouble and expense;\r\nbut the Arabs and Kabyles are as inexpungable as the wandering tribes\r\nof Arabia Petraea or Tartary. With them, neither expulsion, nor\r\nextermination, nor amalgamation is practicable. Very likely France and\r\nEngland will get heartily tired of paying yearly millions for their\r\nunavailable deserts, and there is no knowing what they may be driven\r\nto do in such an extremity. At all events, we may safely assert that\r\nFrance would have saved sixty millions of pounds, and the interminable\r\nprospect of a proportional annual expenditure, had she confined\r\nherself to the town and fortress of Algiers; and England would have\r\nbeen richer and wiser, had she kept within the bounds of the original\r\nDutch colony. The best thing we ourselves can do with our\r\nextra-tropical Africa, is to leave the colonists to govern, and also\r\nto defend themselves from all but enemies by sea: that the French,\r\nunfortunately, cannot do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY NOVEL:\r\n\r\nOR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.\r\n\r\nBY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.\r\n\r\n_Continued from page 269._\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.--INITIAL CHAPTER.\r\n\r\n\"I hope, Pisistratus,\" said my father, \"that you do not intend to be\r\ndull!\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid, sir! what could make you ask such a question?\r\n_Intend!_ No! if I am dull it is from innocence.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very long Discourse upon Knowledge!\" said my father; \"very long. I\r\nshould cut it out!\"\r\n\r\nI looked upon my father as a Byzantian sage might have looked on a\r\nVandal. \"Cut it out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stops the action, sir!\" said my father, dogmatically.\r\n\r\n\"Action! But a novel is not a drama.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is a great deal longer--twenty times as long, I dare say,\"\r\nreplied Mr. Caxton with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir--well! I think my Discourse upon Knowledge has much to do\r\nwith the subject--is vitally essential to the subject; does not stop\r\nthe action--only explains and elucidates the action. And I am\r\nastonished, sir, that you, a scholar, and a cultivator of knowledge--\"\r\n\r\n\"There--there!\" cried my father, deprecatingly; \"I yield--I yield.\r\nWhat better could I expect when I set up for a critic! What author\r\never lived that did not fly into a passion--even with his own father,\r\nif his father presumed to say--'Cut out!' _Pacem imploro_--\"\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Caxton._--\"My dear Austin, I am sure Pisistratus did not mean to\r\noffend you, and I have no doubt he will take your--\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus_, (hastily.)--\"Advice _for the future_, certainly. I will\r\nquicken the action and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on with the Novel,\" whispered Roland, looking up from his eternal\r\naccount-book. \"We have lost L200 by our barley!\"\r\n\r\nTherewith I plunged my pen into the ink, and my thoughts into the\r\n\"Fair Shadowland.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\"Halt!\" cried a voice; and not a little surprised was Leonard when the\r\nstranger who had accosted him the preceding evening got into the\r\nchaise.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Richard, \"I am not the sort of man you expected, eh! Take\r\ntime to recover yourself.\" And with these words Richard drew forth a\r\nbook from his pocket, threw himself back, and began to read. Leonard\r\nstole many a glance at the acute, hardy, handsome face of his\r\ncompanion, and gradually recognized a family likeness to poor John, in\r\nwhom, despite age and infirmity, the traces of no common share of\r\nphysical beauty were still evident. And, with that quick link in ideas\r\nwhich mathematical aptitude bestows, the young student at once\r\nconjectured that he saw before him his uncle Richard. He had the\r\ndiscretion, however, to leave that gentleman free to choose his own\r\ntime for introducing himself, and silently revolved the new thoughts\r\nproduced by the novelty of his situation. Mr. Richard read with\r\nnotable quickness--sometimes cutting the leaves of the book with his\r\npenknife, sometimes tearing them open with his forefinger, sometimes\r\nskipping whole pages altogether. Thus he galloped to the end of the\r\nvolume--flung it aside--lighted his cigar, and began to talk.\r\n\r\nHe put many questions to Leonard relative to his rearing, and\r\nespecially to the mode by which he had acquired his education; and\r\nLeonard, confirmed in the idea that he was replying to a kinsman,\r\nanswered frankly.\r\n\r\nRichard did not think it strange that Leonard should have acquired so\r\nmuch instruction with so little direct tuition. Richard Avenel himself\r\nhad been tutor to himself. He had lived too long with our go-ahead\r\nbrethren, who stride the world on the other side the Atlantic with the\r\nseven-leagued boots of the Giant-killer, not to have caught their\r\nglorious fever for reading. But it was for a reading wholly different\r\nfrom that which was familiar to Leonard. The books he read must be\r\nnew; to read old books would have seemed to him going back in the\r\nworld. He fancied that new books necessarily contained new ideas--a\r\ncommon mistake--and our lucky adventurer was the man of his day.\r\n\r\nTired with talking, he at length chucked the book he had run through\r\nto Leonard, and, taking out a pocket-book and pencil, amused himself\r\nwith calculations on some detail of his business, after which he fell\r\ninto an absorbed train of thought--part pecuniary, part ambitious.\r\n\r\nLeonard found the book interesting; it was one of the numerous works,\r\nhalf-statistic, half-declamatory, relating to the condition of the\r\nworking-classes, which peculiarly distinguish our century, and ought\r\nto bind together rich and poor, by proving the grave attention which\r\nmodern society bestows upon all that can affect the welfare of the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\"Dull stuff--theory--clap-trap,\" said Richard, rousing himself from\r\nhis reverie at last: \"it can't interest you.\"\r\n\r\n\"All books interest me, I think,\" said Leonard, \"and this especially;\r\nfor it relates to the working-class, and I am one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were yesterday, but you mayn't be to-morrow,\" answered Richard\r\ngood-humoredly, and patting him on the shoulder. \"You see, my lad,\r\nthat it is the middle class which ought to govern the country. What\r\nthe book says about the ignorance of country magistrates is very good;\r\nbut the man writes pretty considerable trash when he wants to regulate\r\nthe number of hours a free-born boy should work at a factory--only ten\r\nhours a-day--pooh! and so lose two to the nation! Labor is wealth: and\r\nif we could get men to work twenty-four hours a-day, we should be just\r\ntwice as rich. If the march of civilization is to proceed,\" continued\r\nRichard, loftily, \"men, and boys too, must not lie a-bed doing nothing\r\n_all night_, sir.\" Then with a complacent tone--\"We shall get to the\r\ntwenty-four hours at last; and, by gad, we must, or we shan't flog the\r\nEuropeans as we do now.\"\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the inn at which Richard had first made acquaintance\r\nwith Mr. Dale, the coach by which he had intended to perform the rest\r\nof the journey was found to be full. Richard continued to perform the\r\njourney in post chaises, not without some grumbling at the expense,\r\nand incessant orders to the postboys to make the best of the way.\r\n\"Slow country this, in spite of all its brag,\" said he--\"very slow.\r\nTime is money--they know that in the States; for why, they are all men\r\nof business there. Always slow in a country where a parcel of lazy\r\nidle lords, and dukes, and baronets, seem to think 'time is\r\npleasure.'\"\r\n\r\nTowards evening the chaise approached the confines of a very large\r\ntown, and Richard began to grow fidgety. His easy cavalier air was\r\nabandoned. He withdrew his legs from the window, out of which they had\r\nbeen luxuriously dangling; pulled down his waistcoat; buckled more\r\ntightly his stock: it was clear that he was resuming the decorous\r\ndignity that belongs to state. He was like a monarch who, after\r\ntravelling happy and incognito, returns to his capital. Leonard\r\ndivined at once, that they were nearing their journey's end.\r\n\r\nHumble foot-passengers now looked at the chaise, and touched their\r\nhats. Richard returned the salutation with a nod--a nod less gracious\r\nthan condescending. The chaise turned rapidly to the left, and stopped\r\nbefore a smart lodge, very new, very white, adorned with two Doric\r\ncolumns in stucco, and flanked by a large pair of gates. \"Hollo!\"\r\ncried the postboy, and cracked his whip.\r\n\r\nTwo children were playing before the lodge, and some clothes were\r\nhanging out to dry on the shrubs and pales round the neat little\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\"Hang those brats! they are actually playing,\" growled Dick. \"As I\r\nlive, the jade has been washing again! Stop, boy.\" During this\r\nsoliloquy, a good-looking young woman had rushed from the\r\ndoor--slapped the children, as catching sight of the chaise, they ran\r\ntowards the house--opened the gates, and, dropping a curtsey to the\r\nground, seemed to wish that she could drop into it altogether, so\r\nfrightened and so trembling seemed she to shrink from the wrathful\r\nface which the master now put out of the window.\r\n\r\n\"Did I tell you, or did I not,\" said Dick, \"that I would not have\r\nthese horrid disreputable clubs of yours playing just before my lodge\r\ngates?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't answer me. And did I tell you, or did I not, that the next time\r\nI saw you making a drying-ground of my lilacs, you should go out, neck\r\nand crop--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please, sir--\"\r\n\r\n\"You leave my lodge next Saturday: drive on, boy. The ingratitude and\r\ninsolence of those common people are disgraceful to human nature,\"\r\nmuttered Richard, with an accent of the bitterest misanthropy.\r\n\r\nThe chaise wheeled along the smoothest and freshest of gravel roads,\r\nand through fields of the finest land, in the highest state of\r\ncultivation. Rapid as was Leonard's survey, his rural eye detected the\r\nsigns of a master in the art agronomial. Hitherto he had considered\r\nthe Squire's model farm as the nearest approach to good husbandry he\r\nhad seen: for Jackeymo's finer skill was developed rather on the\r\nminute scale of market-gardening than what can fairly be called\r\nhusbandry. But the Squire's farm was degraded by many old fashioned\r\nnotions, and concessions to the whim of the eye, which would not be\r\nfound in model farms now-a-days,--large tangled hedgerows, which,\r\nthough they constitute one of the beauties most picturesque in old\r\nEngland, make sad deductions from produce; great trees, overshadowing\r\nthe corn, and harboring the birds; little patches of rough sward left\r\nto waste; and angles of woodland running into fields, exposing them to\r\nrabbits, and blocking out the sun. These and such like blots on a\r\ngentleman's agriculture, common-sense and Giacomo had made clear to\r\nthe acute comprehension of Leonard. No such faults were perceptible in\r\nRichard Avenel's domain. The fields lay in broad divisions, the hedges\r\nwere clipped and narrowed into their proper destination of mere\r\nboundaries. Not a blade of wheat withered under the cold shade of a\r\ntree; not a yard of land lay waste; not a weed was to be seen, not a\r\nthistle to waft its baleful seed through the air: some young\r\nplantations were placed, not where the artist would put them, but just\r\nwhere the farmer wanted a fence from the wind. Was there no beauty in\r\nthis? Yes, there was beauty of its kind--beauty at once recognizable\r\nto the initiated--beauty of use and profit--beauty that could bear a\r\nmonstrous high rent. And Leonard uttered a cry of admiration which\r\nthrilled through the heart of Richard Avenel.\r\n\r\n\"This _is_ farming!\" said the villager.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess it is,\" answered Richard, all his ill-humor vanishing.\r\n\"You should have seen the land when I bought it. But we new men, as\r\nthey call us--(damn their impertinence)--are the new blood of this\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nRichard Avenel never said any thing more true. Long may the new blood\r\ncirculate through the veins of the mighty giantess; but let the grand\r\nheart be the same as it has beat for proud ages.\r\n\r\nThe chaise now passed through a pretty shrubbery, and the house came\r\ninto gradual view--a house with a portico--all the offices carefully\r\nthrust out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe postboy dismounted, and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\"I almost think they are going to keep me waiting,\" said Mr. Richard,\r\nwell-nigh in the very words of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nBut that fear was not realized--the door opened; a well-fed servant\r\nout of livery presented himself. There was no hearty welcoming smile\r\non his face, but he opened the chaise-door with demure and taciturn\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\"Where's George? why does not he come to the door?\" asked Richard,\r\ndescending from the chaise slowly, and leaning on the servant's\r\noutstretched arm with as much precaution as if he had had the gout.\r\n\r\nFortunately, George here came into sight, settling himself hastily\r\ninto his livery coat.\r\n\r\n\"See to the things, both of you,\" said Richard, as he paid the\r\npostboy.\r\n\r\nLeonard stood on the gravel sweep, gazing at the square white house.\r\n\r\n\"Handsome elevation--classical, I take it--eh?\" said Richard, joining\r\nhim. \"But you should see the offices.\"\r\n\r\nHe then, with familiar kindness, took Leonard by the arm, and drew him\r\nwithin. He showed him the hall, with a carved mahogany stand for hats;\r\nhe showed him the drawing-room, and pointed out its beauties--though\r\nit was summer the drawing-room looked cold, as will look rooms newly\r\nfurnished, with walls newly papered, in houses newly built. The\r\nfurniture was handsome, and suited to the rank of a rich trader. There\r\nwas no pretence about it, and therefore no vulgarity, which is more\r\nthan can be said for the houses of many an honorable Mrs. Somebody in\r\nMayfair, with rooms twelve feet square, chokeful of buhl, that would\r\nhave had its proper place in the Tuileries. Then Richard showed him\r\nthe library, with mahogany book-cases and plate glass, and the\r\nfashionable authors handsomely bound. Your new men are much better\r\nfriends to living authors than your old families who live in the\r\ncountry, and at most subscribe to a book-club. Then Richard took him\r\nup-stairs, and led him through the bedrooms--all very clean and\r\ncomfortable, and with every modern convenience; and, pausing in a very\r\npretty single gentleman's chamber, said, \"This is your den. And now,\r\ncan you guess who I am?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one but my Uncle Richard could be so kind,\" answered Leonard.\r\n\r\nBut the compliment did not flatter Richard. He was extremely\r\ndisconcerted and disappointed. He had hoped that he should be taken\r\nfor a lord at least, forgetful of all that he had said in\r\ndisparagement of lords.\r\n\r\n\"Pish!\" said he at last, biting his lip--\"so you don't think that I\r\nlook like a gentleman! Come, now, speak honestly.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard wonderingly saw he had given pain, and with the good breeding\r\nwhich comes instinctively from good nature, replied--\"I judged you by\r\nyour heart, sir, and your likeness to my grandfather--otherwise I\r\nshould never have presumed to fancy we could be relations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum!\" answered Richard. \"You can just wash your hands, and then come\r\ndown to dinner; you will hear the gong in ten minutes. There's the\r\nbell--ring for what you want.\"\r\n\r\nWith that, he turned on his heel; and, descending the stairs, gave a\r\nlook into the dining-room, and admired the plated salver on the\r\nsideboard, and the king's pattern spoons and forks on the table. Then\r\nhe walked to the looking-glass over the mantel-piece; and, wishing to\r\nsurvey the whole effect of his form, mounted a chair. He was just\r\ngetting into an attitude which he thought imposing, when the butler\r\nentered, and being London bred, had the discretion to try to escape\r\nunseen; but Richard caught sight of him in the looking-glass, and\r\ncolored up to the temples.\r\n\r\n\"Jarvis,\" said he mildly--\"Jarvis, put me in mind to have these\r\ninexpressibles altered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nApropos of the inexpressibles, Mr. Richard did not forget to provide\r\nhis nephew with a much larger wardrobe than could have been thrust\r\ninto Dr. Riccabocca's knapsack. There was a very good tailor in the\r\ntown, and the clothes were very well made. And, but for an air more\r\ningenuous, and a cheek that, despite study and night vigils, retained\r\nmuch of the sunburnt bloom of the rustic, Leonard Fairfield might now\r\nhave almost passed, without disparaging comment, by the bow-window at\r\nWhite's. Richard burst into an immoderate fit of laughter when he\r\nfirst saw the watch which the poor Italian had bestowed upon Leonard;\r\nbut, to atone for the laughter, he made him a present of a very pretty\r\nsubstitute, and bade him \"lock up his turnip.\" Leonard was more hurt\r\nby the jeer at his old patron's gift than pleased by his uncle's. But\r\nRichard Avenel had no conception of sentiment. It was not for many\r\ndays that Leonard could reconcile himself to his uncle's manner. Not\r\nthat the peasant could pretend to judge of its mere conventional\r\ndefects; but there is an ill breeding to which, whatever our rank and\r\nnurture, we are almost equally sensitive--the ill breeding that comes\r\nfrom want of consideration for others. Now, the Squire was as homely\r\nin his way as Richard Avenel, but the Squire's bluntness rarely hurt\r\nthe feelings: and when it did so, the Squire perceived and hastened to\r\nrepair his blunder. But Mr. Richard, whether kind or cross, was always\r\nwounding you in some little delicate fibre--not from malice, but from\r\nthe absence of any little delicate fibres of his own. He was really,\r\nin many respects, a most excellent man, and certainly a very valuable\r\ncitizen. But his merits wanted the fine tints and fluent curves that\r\nconstitute beauty of character. He was honest, but sharp in his\r\npractice, and with a keen eye to his interests. He was just, but as a\r\nmatter of business. He made no allowances, and did not leave to his\r\njustice the large margin of tenderness and mercy. He was generous, but\r\nrather from an idea of what was due to himself than with much thought\r\nof the pleasure he gave to others; and he even regarded generosity as\r\na capital put out to interest. He expected a great deal of gratitude\r\nin return, and, when he obliged a man, considered that he had bought a\r\nslave. Every needy voter knew where to come, if he wanted relief or a\r\nloan; but woe to him if he had ventured to express hesitation when Mr.\r\nAvenel told him how he must vote.\r\n\r\nIn this town Richard had settled after his return from America, in\r\nwhich country he had enriched himself--first, by spirit and\r\nindustry--lastly, by bold speculation and good luck. He invested his\r\nfortune in business--became a partner in a large brewery--soon bought\r\nout his associates--and then took a principal share in a flourishing\r\ncorn-mill. He prospered rapidly--bought a property of some two or\r\nthree hundred acres, built a house, and resolved to enjoy himself, and\r\nmake a figure. He had now become the leading man of the town, and the\r\nboast to Audley Egerton that he could return one of the members,\r\nperhaps both, was by no means an exaggerated estimate of his power.\r\nNor was his proposition, according to his own views, so unprincipled\r\nas it appeared to the statesman. He had taken a great dislike to both\r\nthe sitting members--a dislike natural to a sensible man of modern\r\npolitics, who had something to lose. For Mr. Slappe, the active\r\nmember--who was head-over-ears in debt--was one of the furious\r\ndemocrats rare before the Reform Bill--and whose opinions were held\r\ndangerous even by the mass of a liberal constituency; while Mr.\r\nSleekie, the gentleman member, who laid by L5000 every year from his\r\ndividends in the Funds, was one of those men whom Richard justly\r\npronounced to be \"humbugs\"--men who curry favor with the extreme party\r\nby voting for measures sure not to be carried; while, if there were\r\nthe least probability of coming to a decision that would lower the\r\nmoney market, Mr. Sleekie was seized with a well-timed influenza.\r\nThose politicians are common enough now. Propose to march to the\r\nMillennium, and they are your men. Ask them to march a quarter of a\r\nmile, and they fall to feeling their pockets, and trembling for fear\r\nof the footpads. They are never so joyful as when there is no chance\r\nof a victory. Did they beat the Minister, they would be carried out of\r\nthe house in a fit.\r\n\r\nRichard Avenel--despising both these gentlemen, and not taking kindly\r\nto the Whigs since the great Whig leaders were Lords--looked with a\r\nfriendly eye to the Government as it then existed, and especially to\r\nAudley Egerton, the enlightened representative of commerce. But in\r\ngiving Audley and his colleagues the benefit of his influence, through\r\nconscience, he thought it all fair and right to have a _quid pro quo_,\r\nand, as he had so frankly confessed, it was his whim to rise up \"Sir\r\nRichard.\" For this worthy citizen abused the aristocracy much on the\r\nsame principle as the fair Olivia depreciated Squire Thornhill--he had\r\na sneaking affection for what he abused. The society of Screwstown\r\nwas, like most provincial capitals, composed of two classes--the\r\ncommercial and the exclusive. These last dwelt chiefly apart, around\r\nthe ruins of an old abbey; they affected its antiquity in their\r\npedigrees, and had much of its ruin in their finances. Widows of rural\r\nthanes in the neighborhood--genteel spinsters--officers retired on\r\nhalf-pay--younger sons of rich squires, who had now become old\r\nbachelors--in short, a very respectable, proud, aristocratic set--who\r\nthought more of themselves than do all the Gowers and Howards,\r\nCourtenays and Seymours, put together. It had early been the ambition\r\nof Richard Avenel to be admitted into this sublime coterie; and,\r\nstrange to say, he had partially succeeded. He was never more happy\r\nthan when he was asked to their card-parties, and never more unhappy\r\nthan when he was actually there. Various circumstances combined to\r\nraise Mr. Avenel into this elevated society. First, he was unmarried,\r\nstill very handsome, and in that society there was a large proportion\r\nof unwedded females. Secondly, he was the only rich trader in\r\nScrewstown who kept a good cook, and professed to give dinners, and\r\nthe half-pay captains and colonels swallowed the host for the sake of\r\nthe venison. Thirdly, and principally, all these exclusives abhorred\r\nthe two sitting members, and \"idem nolle idem velle de republica, ea\r\nfirma amicitia est;\" that is, congeniality in politics pieces\r\nporcelain and crockery together better than the best diamond cement.\r\nThe sturdy Richard Avenel--who valued himself on American\r\nindependence--held these ladies and gentlemen in an awe that was truly\r\nBrahminical. Whether it was that, in England, all notions, even of\r\nliberty, are mixed up historically, traditionally, socially, with that\r\nfine and subtle element of aristocracy which, like the press, is the\r\nair we breathe; or whether Richard imagined that he really became\r\nmagnetically imbued with the virtues of these silver pennies and gold\r\nseven-shilling pieces, distinct from the vulgar coinage in popular\r\nuse, it is hard to say. But the truth must be told--Richard Avenel was\r\na notable tuft-hunter. He had a great longing to marry out of this\r\nsociety; but he had not yet seen any one sufficiently high-born and\r\nhigh-bred to satisfy his aspirations. In the mean while, he had\r\nconvinced himself that his way would be smooth could he offer to make\r\nhis ultimate choice \"My Lady;\" and he felt that it would be a proud\r\nhour in his life when he could walk before stiff Colonel Pompley to\r\nthe sound of \"Sir Richard.\" Still, however disappointed at the ill\r\nsuccess of his bluff diplomacy with Mr. Egerton, and however yet\r\ncherishing the most vindictive resentment against that individual--he\r\ndid not, as many would have done, throw up his political convictions\r\nout of personal spite. He resolved still to favor the ungrateful and\r\nundeserving administration; and as Audley Egerton had acted on the\r\nrepresentations of the mayor and deputies, and shaped his bill to meet\r\ntheir views, so Avenel and the Government rose together in the popular\r\nestimation of the citizens of Screwstown.\r\n\r\nBut, duly to appreciate the value of Richard Avenel, and in just\r\ncounterpoise to all his foibles, one ought to have seen what he had\r\neffected for the town. Well might he boast of \"new blood;\" he had done\r\nas much for the town as he had for his fields. His energy, his quick\r\ncomprehension of public utility, backed by his wealth, and bold,\r\nbullying, imperious character, had sped the work of civilization as if\r\nwith the celerity and force of a steam-engine.\r\n\r\nIf the town were so well paved and so well lighted--if half-a-dozen\r\nsqualid lanes had been transformed into a stately street--if half the\r\ntown no longer depended on tanks for their water--if the poor-rates\r\nwere reduced one-third,--praise to the brisk new blood which Richard\r\nAvenel had infused into vestry and corporation. And his example itself\r\nwas so contagious! \"There was not a plate-glass window in the town\r\nwhen I came into it,\" said Richard Avenel; \"and now look down the High\r\nStreet!\" He took the credit to himself, and justly; for, though his\r\nown business did not require windows of plate-glass, he had awakened\r\nthe spirit of enterprise which adorns a whole city.\r\n\r\nMr. Avenel did not present Leonard to his friends for more than a\r\nfortnight. He allowed him to wear off his rust. He then gave a grand\r\ndinner, at which his nephew was formally introduced, and, to his great\r\nwrath and disappointment, never opened his lips. How could he, poor\r\nyouth, when Miss Clarina Mowbray only talked upon high life; till\r\nproud Colonel Pompley went in state through the history of the siege\r\nof Seringapatam.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWhile Leonard accustoms himself gradually to the splendors that\r\nsurround him, and often turns with a sigh to the remembrance of his\r\nmother's cottage and the sparkling fount in the Italian's flowery\r\ngarden, we will make with thee, O reader, a rapid flight to the\r\nmetropolis, and drop ourselves amidst the gay groups that loiter along\r\nthe dusty ground, or loll over the roadside palings of Hyde Park. The\r\nseason is still at its height; but the short day of fashionable London\r\nlife, which commences two hours after noon, is in its decline. The\r\ncrowd in Rotten Row begins to thin. Near the statue of Achilles, and\r\napart from all other loungers, a gentleman, with one hand thrust into\r\nhis waistcoat, and the other resting on his cane, gazed listlessly on\r\nthe horsemen and carriages in the brilliant ring. He was still in the\r\nprime of life, at the age when man is usually the most social--when\r\nthe acquaintances of youth have ripened into friendship, and a\r\npersonage of some rank and fortune has become a well-known feature in\r\nthe mobile face of society. But though, when his contemporaries were\r\nboys scarce at college, this gentleman had blazed foremost amongst the\r\nprinces of fashion, and though he had all the qualities of nature and\r\ncircumstance which either retain fashion to the last, or exchange its\r\nfalse celebrity for a graver repute, he stood as a stranger in that\r\nthrong of his countrymen. Beauties whirled by to the toilet--statesmen\r\npassed on to the senate--dandies took flight to the clubs; and neither\r\nnods, nor becks, nor wreathed smiles, said to the solitary spectator,\r\n\"Follow us--thou art one of our set.\" Now and then, some middle-aged\r\nbeau, nearing the post of the loiterer, turned round to look again;\r\nbut the second glance seemed to dissipate the recognition of the\r\nfirst, and the beau silently continued his way.\r\n\r\n\"By the tombs of my fathers!\" said the solitary to himself, \"I know\r\nnow what a dead man might feel if he came to life again, and took a\r\npeep at the living.\"\r\n\r\nTime passed on--the evening shades descended fast. Our stranger in\r\nLondon had well-nigh the Park to himself. He seemed to breathe more\r\nfreely as he saw that the space was so clear.\r\n\r\n\"There's oxygen in the atmosphere now,\" said he, half aloud; \"and I\r\ncan walk without breathing in the gaseous fumes of the multitude. O\r\nthose chemists--what dolts they are! They tell us crowds taint the\r\nair, but they never guess why! Pah, it is not the lungs that poison\r\nthe element--it is the reek of bad hearts. When a periwig-pated fellow\r\nbreathes on me, I swallow a mouthful of care. _Allons!_ my friend\r\nNero; now for a stroll.\" He touched with his cane a large Newfoundland\r\ndog, who lay stretched near his feet; a dog and man went slow through\r\nthe growing twilight, and over the brown dry turf. At length our\r\nsolitary paused, and threw himself on a bench under a tree.\r\n\"Half-past eight!\" said he, looking at his watch--\"one may smoke one's\r\ncigar without shocking the world.\"\r\n\r\nHe took out his cigar-case, struck a light, and in another moment\r\nreclined at length on the bench--seemed absorbed in regarding the\r\nsmoke, that scarce colored ere it vanished into air.\r\n\r\n\"It is the most barefaced lie in the world, my Nero,\" said he,\r\naddressing his dog, \"this boasted liberty of man! Now here am I, a\r\nfree-born Englishman, a citizen of the world, caring--I often say to\r\nmyself--caring not a jot for Kaisar or Mob; and yet I no more dare\r\nsmoke this cigar in the Park at half-past six, when all the world is\r\nabroad, than I dare pick my Lord Chancellor's pocket, or hit the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury a thump on the nose. Yet no law in England\r\nforbids me my cigar, Nero! What is law at half-past eight, was not\r\ncrime at six and a-half! Britannia says, 'Man, thou art free,' and she\r\nlies like a commonplace woman. O Nero, Nero! you enviable dog!--you\r\nserve but from liking. No thought of the world costs you one wag of\r\nyour tail. Your big heart and true instinct suffice you for reason and\r\nlaw. You would want nothing to your felicity, if in these moments of\r\nennui you would but smoke a cigar. Try it, Nero!--try it!\" And, rising\r\nfrom his incumbent posture, he sought to force the end of the weed\r\nbetween the teeth of the dog.\r\n\r\nWhile thus gravely engaged, two figures had approached the place. The\r\none was a man who seemed weak and sickly. His threadbare coat was\r\nbuttoned to the chin, but hung large on his shrunken breast. The other\r\nwas a girl of about fourteen, on whose arm he leant heavily. Her cheek\r\nwas wan, and there was a patient sad look on her face, which seemed so\r\nsettled that you would think she could never have known the\r\nmirthfulness of childhood.\r\n\r\n\"Pray rest here, papa,\" said the child softly; and she pointed to the\r\nbench, without taking heed of its pre-occupant, who now, indeed,\r\nconfined to one corner of the seat, was almost hidden by the shadow of\r\na tree.\r\n\r\nThe man sat down with a feeble sigh; and then, observing the stranger,\r\nraised his hat, and said in that tone of voice which betrays the\r\nusages of polished society, \"Forgive me, if I intrude on you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger looked up from his dog, and seeing that the girl was\r\nstanding, rose at once, as if to make room for her on the bench.\r\n\r\nBut still the girl did not heed him. She hung over her father, and\r\nwiped his brow tenderly with a little kerchief which she took from her\r\nown neck for the purpose.\r\n\r\nNero, delighted to escape the cigar, had taken to some unwieldy\r\ncurvets and gambols, to vent the excitement into which he had been\r\nthrown; and now returning, approached the bench with a low look of\r\nsurprise, and sniffed at the intruders on his master's privacy.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, sir,\" said the master. \"You need not fear him,\" he added,\r\naddressing himself to the girl.\r\n\r\nBut the girl, without turning round to him, cried in a voice rather of\r\nanguish than alarm, \"He has fainted! Father! father!\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger kicked aside his dog, which was in the way, and loosened\r\nthe poor man's stiff military stock. While thus charitably engaged,\r\nthe moon broke out, and the light fell full on the pale care-worn face\r\nof the unconscious sufferer.\r\n\r\n\"This face seems not unfamiliar to me, though sadly changed,\" said the\r\nstranger to himself; and bending towards the girl, who had sunk on her\r\nknees and was chafing her father's hands, he asked, \"My child, what is\r\nyour father's name?\"\r\n\r\nThe child continued her task, too absorbed to answer.\r\n\r\nThe stranger put his hand on her shoulder, and repeated the question.\r\n\r\n\"Digby,\" answered the child, almost unconsciously; and as she spoke,\r\nthe man's senses began to return. In a few minutes more he had\r\nsufficiently recovered to falter forth his thanks to the stranger. But\r\nthe last took his hand, and said, in a voice at once tremulous and\r\nsoothing, \"Is it possible that I see once more an old brother in arms?\r\nAlgernon Digby, I do not forget you; but it seems England has\r\nforgotten!\"\r\n\r\nA hectic flush spread over the soldier's face, and he looked away from\r\nthe speaker as he answered--\r\n\r\n\"My name is Digby, it is true, sir; but I do not think we have met\r\nbefore. Come, Helen, I am well now--we will go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try and play with that great dog, my child,\" said the stranger--\"I\r\nwant to talk with your father.\"\r\n\r\nThe child bowed her submissive head, and moved away; but she did not\r\nplay with the dog.\r\n\r\n\"I must re-introduce myself, formally, I see,\" quoth the stranger.\r\n\"You were in the same regiment with myself, and my name is\r\nL'Estrange.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said the soldier, rising, \"forgive me that--\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that it was the fashion to call me 'my lord' at the\r\nmess-table. Come, what has happened to you?--on half pay?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Digby shook his head mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"Digby, old fellow, can you lend me L100?\" said Lord L'Estrange,\r\nclapping his _ci-devant_ brother officer on the shoulder, and in a\r\ntone of voice that seemed like a boy's--so impudent was it and\r\ndevil-me-carish. \"No! Well, that's lucky, for I can lend it to you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Digby burst into tears.\r\n\r\nLord L'Estrange did not seem to observe the emotion. \"We were both sad\r\nextravagant fellows in our day,\" said he, \"and I dare say I borrowed\r\nof you pretty freely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me! Oh, Lord L'Estrange?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have married since then, and reformed, I suppose. Tell me, old\r\nfriend, all about it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Digby, who by this time had succeeded in restoring some calm to\r\nhis shattered nerves, now rose, and said in brief sentences, but clear\r\nfirm tones,--\r\n\r\n\"My Lord, it is idle to talk of me--useless to help me. I am fast\r\ndying. But, my child there, my only child, (he paused an instant, and\r\nwent on rapidly.) I have relations in a distant country, if I could\r\nbut get to them--I think they would at least provide for her. This has\r\nbeen for weeks my hope, my dream, my prayer. I cannot afford the\r\njourney except by your help. I have begged without shame for myself;\r\nshall I be ashamed, then, to beg for her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Digby,\" said L'Estrange with some grave alteration of manner, \"talk\r\nneither of dying, nor begging. You were nearer death when the balls\r\nwhistled round you at Waterloo. If soldier meets soldier and says,\r\n'Friend, thy purse,' it is not begging, but brotherhood. Ashamed! By\r\nthe soul of Belisarius! if I needed money, I would stand at a crossing\r\nwith my Waterloo medal over my breast, and say to each sleek citizen I\r\nhad helped to save from the sword of the Frenchman, 'It is your shame\r\nif I starve.' Now, lean upon me; I see you should be at home--which\r\nway?\"\r\n\r\nThe poor soldier pointed his hand towards Oxford Street, and\r\nreluctantly accepted the proffered arm.\r\n\r\n\"And when you return from your relations, you will call on me?\r\nWhat!--hesitate? Come, promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"On your honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I live, on my honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am staying at present at Knightsbridge, with my father; but you\r\nwill always hear of my address at No. -- Grosvenor Square, Mr.\r\nEgerton's. So you have a long journey before you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not fatigue yourself--travel slowly. Ho, you foolish child!--I see\r\nyou are jealous of me. Your father has another arm to spare you.\"\r\n\r\nThus talking, and getting but short answers, Lord L'Estrange continued\r\nto exhibit those whimsical peculiarities of character, which had\r\nobtained for him the repute of heartlessness in the world. Perhaps the\r\nreader may think the world was not in the right. But if ever the world\r\ndoes judge rightly of the character of a man who does not live for the\r\nworld, nor talk of the world, nor feel with the world, it will be\r\ncenturies after the soul of Harley L'Estrange has done with this\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nLord L'Estrange parted company with Mr. Digby at the entrance of\r\nOxford Street. The father and child there took a cabriolet. Mr. Digby\r\ndirected the driver to go down the Edgeware Road. He refused to tell\r\nL'Estrange his address, and this with such evident pain, from the\r\nsores of pride, that L'Estrange could not press the point. Reminding\r\nthe soldier of his promise to call, Harley thrust a pocket-book into\r\nhis hand, and walked off hastily towards Grosvenor Square.\r\n\r\nHe reached Audley Egerton's door just as that gentleman was getting\r\nout of his carriage; and the two friends entered the house together.\r\n\r\n\"Does the nation take a nap to-night?\" asked L'Estrange. \"Poor old\r\nlady! She hears so much of her affairs, that she may well boast of her\r\nconstitution: it must be of iron.\"\r\n\r\n\"The House is still sitting,\" answered Audley seriously, and with\r\nsmall heed of his friend's witticism. \"But it is not a Government\r\nmotion, and the division will be late, so I came home; and if I had\r\nnot found you here, I should have gone into the park to look for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--one always knows where to find me at this hour, 9 o'clock\r\nP.M.--cigar--Hyde Park. There is not a man in England so regular in\r\nhis habits.\"\r\n\r\nHere the friends reached a drawing-room in which the member of\r\nParliament seldom sat, for his private apartments were all on the\r\nground floor.\r\n\r\n\"But it is the strangest whim of yours, Harley,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"To affect detestation of ground-floors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Affect! O sophisticated man, of the earth, earthy! Affect!--nothing\r\nless natural to the human soul than a ground-floor. We are quite far\r\nenough from heaven, mount as many stairs as we will, without\r\ngrovelling by preference.\"\r\n\r\n\"According to that symbolical view of the case,\" said Audley, \"you\r\nshould lodge in an attic.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I would, but that I abhor new slippers. As for hair-brushes, I am\r\nindifferent!\"\r\n\r\n\"What have slippers and hair-brushes to do with attics?\"\r\n\r\n\"Try! Make your bed in an attic, and the next morning you will have\r\nneither slippers nor hair-brushes!\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall I have done with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shied them at the cats!\"\r\n\r\n\"What odd things you do say, Harley!\"\r\n\r\n\"Odd! By Apollo and his nine spinsters! there is no human being who\r\nhas so little imagination as a distinguished Member of Parliament.\r\nAnswer me this, thou solemn right honorable--Hast thou climbed to the\r\nheights of august contemplation? Hast thou gazed on the stars with the\r\nrapt eye of song? Hast thou dreamed of a love known to the angels, or\r\nsought to seize in the Infinite the mystery of life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I indeed, my poor Harley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then no wonder, poor Audley, that you cannot conjecture why he who\r\nmakes his bed in an attic, disturbed by base catterwauls, shies his\r\nslippers at cats. Bring a chair into the balcony. Nero spoiled my\r\ncigar to-night. I am going to smoke now. You never smoke. You can look\r\non the shrubs in the Square.\"\r\n\r\nAudley slightly shrugged his shoulders, but he followed his friend's\r\ncounsel and example, and brought his chair into the balcony. Nero\r\ncame too, but at sight and smell of the cigar prudently retreated, and\r\ntook refuge under the table.\r\n\r\n\"Audley Egerton, I want something from Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a cornet in my regiment, who would have done better not to\r\nhave come into it. We were, for the most part of us, puppies and\r\nfops.\"\r\n\r\n\"You all fought well, however.\"\r\n\r\n\"Puppies and fops do fight well. Vanity and valor generally go\r\ntogether. Caesar, who scratched his head with due care of his scanty\r\ncurls, and, even in dying, thought of the folds in his toga; Walter\r\nRaleigh, who could not walk twenty yards, because of the gems in his\r\nshoes; Alcibiades, who lounged into the Agora with doves in his bosom,\r\nand an apple in his hand; Murat, bedizened in gold lace and furs; and\r\nDemetrius, the City-Taker, who made himself up like a French\r\n_Marquise_,--were all pretty good fellows at fighting. A slovenly hero\r\nlike Cromwell is a paradox in nature, and a marvel in history. But to\r\nreturn to my cornet. We were rich; he was poor. When the pot of clay\r\nswims down the stream with the brass-pots, it is sure of a smash. Men\r\nsaid Digby was stingy; I saw he was extravagant. But every one, I\r\nfear, would be rather thought stingy than poor. _Bref._--I left the\r\narmy, and saw him no more till to-night. There was never shabby poor\r\ngentleman on the stage more awfully shabby, more pathetically\r\ngentleman. But, look ye, this man has fought for England. It was no\r\nchild's play at Waterloo, let me tell you, Mr. Egerton; and, but for\r\nsuch men, you would be at best a _sous-prefet_, and your Parliament a\r\nProvincial Assembly. You must do something for Digby. What shall it\r\nbe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, really, my dear Harley, this man was no great friend of\r\nyours--eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"If he were, he would not want the Government to help him--he would\r\nnot be ashamed of taking money from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all very fine, Harley; but there are so many poor officers,\r\nand so little to give. It is the most difficult thing in the world\r\nthat which you ask me. Indeed, I know nothing can be done: he has his\r\nhalf-pay?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not; or, if he has it, no doubt it all goes on his debts.\r\nThat's nothing to us: the man and his child are starving.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if it is his own fault--if he has been imprudent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah--well, well; where the devil is Nero?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so sorry I can't oblige you. If it were any thing else--\"\r\n\r\n\"There is something else. My valet--I can't turn him adrift--excellent\r\nfellow, but gets drunk now and then. Will you find him a place in the\r\nStamp Office?\"\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, now I think of it--the man knows my ways: I must keep him. But my\r\nold wine-merchant--civil man, never dunned--is a bankrupt. I am under\r\ngreat obligations to him, and he has a very pretty daughter. Do you\r\nthink you could thrust him into some small place in the colonies, or\r\nmake him a King's Messenger, or something of the sort?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you very much wish it, no doubt I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Audley, I am but feeling my way: the fact is, I want\r\nsomething for myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that indeed gives me pleasure!\" cried Egerton, with animation.\r\n\r\n\"The mission to Florence will soon be vacant--I know it privately. The\r\nplace would quite suit me. Pleasant city; the best figs in Italy--very\r\nlittle to do. You could sound Lord ---- on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will answer beforehand. Lord ----would be enchanted to secure to\r\nthe public service a man so accomplished as yourself, and the son of a\r\npeer like Lord Lansmere.\"\r\n\r\nHarley L'Estrange sprang to his feet, and flung his cigar in the face\r\nof a stately policeman who was looking up at the balcony.\r\n\r\n\"Infamous and bloodless official!\" cried Harley L'Estrange; \"so you\r\ncould provide for a pimple-nosed lackey--for a wine-merchant who has\r\nbeen poisoning the king's subjects with white-lead or sloe-juice--for\r\nan idle sybarite, who would complain of a crumpled rose-leaf; and\r\nnothing, in all the vast patronage of England, for a broken down\r\nsoldier, whose dauntless breast was her rampart!\"\r\n\r\n\"Harley,\" said the member of Parliament, with his calm, sensible\r\nsmile, \"this would be a very good clap-trap at a small theatre; but\r\nthere is nothing in which Parliament demands such rigid economy as the\r\nmilitary branch of the public service; and no man for whom it is so\r\nhard to effect what we must plainly call a job, as a subaltern\r\nofficer, who has done nothing more than his duty--and all military men\r\ndo that. Still, as you take it so earnestly, I will use what interest\r\nI can at the War Office, and get him, perhaps, the mastership of a\r\nbarrack.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better; for if you do not, I swear I will turn radical, and\r\ncome down to your own city to oppose you, with Hunt and Cobbett to\r\ncanvass for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be very glad to see you come into Parliament, even as a\r\nradical, and at my expense,\" said Audley, with great kindness. \"But\r\nthe air is growing cold, and you are not accustomed to our climate.\r\nNay, if you are too poetic for catarrhs and rheums, I'm not--come in.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nLord L'Estrange threw himself on a sofa, and leant his cheek on his\r\nhand thoughtfully. Audley Egerton sat near him, with his arms folded,\r\nand gazed on his friend's face with a soft expression of aspect, which\r\nwas very unusual to the firm outline of his handsome features. The two\r\nmen were as dissimilar in person as the reader will have divined that\r\nthey were in character. All about Egerton was so rigid, all about\r\nL'Estrange so easy. In every posture of Harley there was the\r\nunconscious grace of a child. The very fashion of his garments showed\r\nhis abhorrence of restraint. His clothes were wide and loose, his\r\nneckcloth tied carelessly, left his throat half bare. You could see\r\nthat he had lived much in warm and southern lands, and contracted a\r\ncontempt for conventionalities; there was as little in his dress as in\r\nhis talk of the formal precision of the north. He was three or four\r\nyears younger than Audley, but he looked at least twelve years\r\nyounger. In fact, he was one of those men to whom old age seems\r\nimpossible--voice, look, figure, had all the charm of youth; and,\r\nperhaps, it was from this gracious youthfulness--at all events, it was\r\ncharacteristic of the kind of love he inspired--that neither his\r\nparents, nor the few friends admitted into his intimacy, ever called\r\nhim, in their habitual intercourse, by the name of his title. He was\r\nnot L'Estrange with them, he was Harley; and by that familiar\r\nbaptismal I will usually designate him. He was not one of those men\r\nwhom author or reader wish to view at a distance, and remember as \"my\r\nlord\"--it was so rarely that he remembered it himself. For the rest,\r\nit had been said of him by a shrewd wit--\"He is so natural, that every\r\none calls him affected.\" Harley L'Estrange was not so critically\r\nhandsome as Audley Egerton; to a commonplace observer he was, at best,\r\nrather good-looking than otherwise. But women said that he had a\r\nbeautiful countenance, and they were not wrong. He wore his hair,\r\nwhich was of a fair chestnut, long, and in loose curls; and instead of\r\nthe Englishman's whiskers, indulged in the foreigner's moustache. His\r\ncomplexion was delicate, though not effeminate; it was rather the\r\ndelicacy of a student than of a woman. But in his clear gray eye there\r\nwas wonderful vigor of life. A skilful physiologist, looking only into\r\nthat eye, would have recognized rare stamina of constitution--a nature\r\nso rich that, while easily disturbed, it would require all the effects\r\nof time, or all the fell combinations of passion and grief, to exhaust\r\nit. Even now, though so thoughtful, and even so sad, the rays of that\r\neye were as concentred and stedfast as the light of the diamond.\r\n\r\n\"You were only, then, in jest,\" said Audley, after a long silence,\r\n\"when you spoke of this mission to Florence. You have still no idea of\r\nentering into public life.\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had hoped better things when I got your promise to pass one season\r\nin London. But, indeed, you have kept your promise to the ear to break\r\nit to the spirit. I could not presuppose that you would shun all\r\nsociety, and be as much of a hermit here as under the vines of Como.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have sat in the Strangers' Gallery, and heard your great speakers;\r\nI have been in the pit of the opera, and seen your fine ladies; I have\r\nwalked your streets, I have lounged in your parks, and I say that I\r\ncan't fall in love with a faded dowager, because she fills up her\r\nwrinkles with rouge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what dowager do you speak?\" asked the matter-of-fact Audley.\r\n\r\n\"She has a great many titles. Some people call her fashion, you busy\r\nmen, politics: it is all one--tricked out and artificial. I mean\r\nLondon life. No, I can't fall in love with her, fawning old harridan!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you could fall in love with something.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could, with all my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are so _blase_.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, I am so fresh. Look out of the window--what do you\r\nsee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but houses and dusty lilacs, my coachman dozing on his box,\r\nand two women in pattens crossing the kennel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see none of that where I lie on the sofa. I see but the stars. And\r\nI feel for them as I did when I was a schoolboy at Eton. It is you who\r\nare _blase_, not I--enough of this. You do not forget my commission,\r\nwith respect to the exile who has married into your brother's family?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but here you set me a task more difficult than that of saddling\r\nyour cornet on the War Office.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it is difficult, for the counter influence is vigilant and\r\nstrong; but, on the other hand, the enemy is so damnable a traitor\r\nthat one must have the Fates and the household gods on one's side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" said the practical Audley, bending over a book on the\r\ntable, \"I think that the best plan would be to attempt a compromise\r\nwith the traitor.\"\r\n\r\n\"To judge of others by myself,\" answered Harley with spirit, \"it were\r\nless bitter to put up with wrong than to palter with it for\r\ncompensation. And such wrong! Compromise with the open foe--that may\r\nbe done with honor; but with the perjured friend--that were to forgive\r\nthe perjury.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are too vindictive,\" said Egerton; \"there may be excuses for the\r\nfriend, which palliate even--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! Audley, hush! or I shall think the world has indeed corrupted\r\nyou. Excuse for the friend who deceives, who betrays! No, such is the\r\ntrue outlaw of Humanity; and the Furies surround him even while he\r\nsleeps in the temple.\"\r\n\r\nThe man of the world lifted his eye slowly on the animated face of one\r\nstill natural enough for the passions. He then once more returned to\r\nhis book, and said, after a pause, \"It is time you should marry,\r\nHarley.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered L'Estrange, with a smile at this sudden turn in the\r\nconversation--\"not time yet; for my chief objection to that change in\r\nlife is, that all the women now-a-days are too old for me, or I am too\r\nyoung for them; a few, indeed, are so infantine that one is ashamed\r\nto be their toy; but most are so knowing that one is a fool to be\r\ntheir dupe. The first, if they condescend to love you, love you as the\r\nbiggest doll they have yet dandled, and for a doll's good\r\nqualities--your pretty blue eyes, and your exquisite millinery. The\r\nlast, if they prudently accept you, do so on algebraical principles;\r\nyou are but the X or the Y that represents a certain aggregate of\r\ngoods matrimonial--pedigree, title, rent-roll, diamonds, pin-money,\r\nopera-box. They cast you up with the help of mamma, and you wake some\r\nmorning to find that _plus_ wife _minus_ affection equals--the Devil!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" said Audley, with his quiet grave laugh. \"I grant that it\r\nis often the misfortune of a man in your station to be married rather\r\nfor what he has, than for what he is; but you are tolerably\r\npenetrating, and not likely to be deceived in the character of the\r\nwoman you court.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the woman I _court_?--No! But of the woman I _marry_, very likely\r\nindeed. Woman is a changeable thing, as our Virgil informed us at\r\nschool; but her change _par excellence_ is from the fairy you woo to\r\nthe brownie you wed. It is not that she has been a hypocrite,\r\nit is that she is a transmigration. You marry a girl for her\r\naccomplishments. She paints charmingly, or plays like St. Cecilia.\r\nClap a ring on her finger, and she never draws again--except perhaps\r\nyour caricature on the back of a letter, and never opens a piano after\r\nthe honeymoon. You marry her for her sweet temper; and next year, her\r\nnerves are so shattered that you can't contradict her but you are\r\nwhirled into a storm of hysterics. You marry her because she declares\r\nshe hates balls and likes quiet; and ten to one but what she becomes a\r\npatroness at Almacks, or a lady in waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet most men marry, and most men survive the operation.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it were only necessary to live, that would be a consolatory and\r\nencouraging reflection. But to live with peace, to live with dignity,\r\nto live with freedom, to live in harmony with your thoughts, your\r\nhabits, your aspirations--and this in the perpetual companionship of a\r\nperson to whom you have given the power to wound your peace, to assail\r\nyour dignity, to cripple your freedom, to jar on each thought and each\r\nhabit, and bring you down to the meanest details of earth, when you\r\ninvite her, poor soul, to soar to the spheres--that makes the to be,\r\nor not to be, which is the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I were you, Harley, I would do as I have heard the author of\r\n_Sandford and Merton_ did--choose out a child, and educate her\r\nyourself after your own heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have hit it,\" answered Harley, seriously. \"That has long been my\r\nidea--a very vague one, I confess. But I fear I shall be an old man\r\nbefore I find even the child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he continued, yet more earnestly, while the whole character of\r\nhis varying countenance changed again--\"ah! if indeed I could discover\r\nwhat I seek--one who with the heart of a child has the mind of a\r\nwoman; one who beholds in nature the variety, the charm, the never\r\nfeverish, ever healthful excitement that others vainly seek in the\r\nbastard sentimentalities of a life false with artificial forms; one\r\nwho can comprehend, as by intuition, the rich poetry with which\r\ncreation is clothed--poetry so clear to the child when enraptured with\r\nthe flower, or when wondering at the star? If on me such exquisite\r\ncompanionship were bestowed--why, then\"--he paused, sighed deeply,\r\nand, covering his face with his hand, resumed in faltering accents,--\r\n\r\n\"But once--but once only, did such vision of the Beautiful made human\r\nrise before me--amidst 'golden exhalations of the dawn.' It beggared\r\nmy life in vanishing. You know only--you only--how--how\"--\r\n\r\nHe bowed his head, and the tears forced themselves through his\r\nclenched fingers.\r\n\r\n\"So long ago!\" said Audley, sharing his friend's emotion. \"Years so\r\nlong and so weary, yet still thus tenacious of a mere boyish memory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Away with it, then!\" cried Harley, springing to his feet, and with a\r\nlaugh of strange merriment. \"Your carriage still waits; set me home\r\nbefore you go to the House.\"\r\n\r\nThen laying his hand lightly on his friend's shoulder, he said, \"Is it\r\nfor you, Audley Egerton, to speak sneeringly of boyish memories? What\r\nelse is it that binds us together? What else warms my heart when I\r\nmeet you? What else draws your thoughts from blue-books and\r\nbeer-bills, to waste them on a vagrant like me? Shake hands. Oh,\r\nfriend of my boyhood! recollect the oars that we plied and the bats\r\nthat we wielded in the old time, or the murmured talk on the\r\nmoss-grown bank, as we sat together, building in the summer air\r\ncastles mightier than Windsor. Ah! they are strong ties, those boyish\r\nmemories, believe me! I remember as if it were yesterday my\r\ntranslation of that lovely passage in Perseus, beginning--let me\r\nsee--ah!--\r\n\r\n    \"Quum primum pavido custos mihi purpura cessit,\"\r\n\r\nthat passage on friendship which gushes out so livingly from the stern\r\nheart of the satirist. And when old ---- complimented me on my verses,\r\nmy eye sought yours. Verily, I now say as then,\r\n\r\n    \"Nescio quod, certe est quod me tibi temperet astrum.\"[8]\r\n\r\nAudley turned away his head as he returned the grasp of his friend's\r\nhand; and while Harley, with his light elastic footstep, descended the\r\nstairs, Egerton lingered behind, and there was no trace of the worldly\r\nman upon his countenance when he took his place in the carriage by his\r\ncompanion's side.\r\n\r\nTwo hours afterwards, weary cries of \"Question, question!\" \"Divide,\r\ndivide!\" sank into reluctant silence as Audley Egerton rose to\r\nconclude the debate--the man of men to speak late at night, and to\r\nimpatient benches: a man who would be heard; whom a Bedlam broke loose\r\nwould not have roared down; with a voice clear and sound as a bell,\r\nand a form as firmly set on the ground as a church-tower. And while,\r\non the dullest of dull questions, Audley Egerton thus, not too lively\r\nhimself, enforced attention, where was Harley L'Estrange? Standing\r\nalone by the river at Richmond, and murmuring low fantastic thoughts\r\nas he gazed on the moonlit tide.\r\n\r\nWhen Audley left him at home, he had joined his parents, made them gay\r\nwith his careless gayety, seen the old-fashioned folks retire to rest,\r\nand then--while they, perhaps, deemed him once more the hero of\r\nball-rooms and the cynosure of clubs--he drove slowly through the soft\r\nsummer night, amidst the perfumes of many a garden and many a gleaming\r\nchestnut grove, with no other aim before him than to reach the\r\nloveliest margin of England's loveliest river, at the hour the moon\r\nwas fullest and the song of the nightingale most sweet. And so\r\neccentric a humorist was this man, that I believe, as he there\r\nloitered--no one near to cry \"How affected!\" or \"How romantic!\"--he\r\nenjoyed himself more than if he had been exchanging the politest\r\n\"how-d'ye-do's\" in the hottest of London drawing-rooms, or betting his\r\nhundreds on the odd trick with Lord de R---- for his partner.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] \"What was the star I know not, but certainly some star it was that\r\nattuned me unto thee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the London Examiner.\r\n\r\nA GLIMPSE OF THE GREAT EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one country which is not represented at the Great Exhibition,\r\none power which refused to send any specimens of its produce, lest the\r\nhaving done so should be considered as a tribute to the commercial\r\ngreatness of England, and lest exhibitors and exhibited should incur\r\ncontamination by contact with specimens of the world's industry. One\r\nis not sorry that this should be the case, and that the felon power of\r\nEurope should have thus passed judgment on itself, and of its own\r\naccord placed itself in Coventry.\r\n\r\nThe country we allude to is Naples. The horror which the king\r\nentertains of any thing constitutional since his Majesty took the oath\r\nto his own constitution, and since he hanged those who committed the\r\nsame crime without afterwards perjuring themselves after the royal\r\nexample, has induced him to prohibit the sending of any specimens to\r\nLondon. Naples, to be sure, has little to exhibit. Industry in that\r\ncountry, so blessed by nature, has been crushed and annihilated by the\r\nhand of tyranny. Sulphur and other volcanic products, wine which\r\nscience has never enabled to bear exportation, silk in its _brut_\r\nstate, with some coarse fabrics of cloth and linen, and hats in\r\nimitation of Tuscany, compose all the industry of one of the finest\r\ncountries in Europe. No marvel, therefore, it should have shrunk upon\r\nany pretence from occupying a booth at the Great Exhibition.\r\n\r\nA very different place in that great show is held by Piedmont, which\r\nhas furnished a large assortment of raw materials and manufactured\r\narticles. On the other hand, Florence and Venice are far, we fear,\r\nfrom even keeping up a shadow of their old reputation. The country of\r\nBenvenuto Cellini has lost the gift of the arts with that of freedom;\r\nand the manufactures with which Venice used to pay for the merchandise\r\nof the East are no more. Strange to say, however, Milan supplies one\r\nof the most interesting and perfect compartments of the Exhibition,\r\nthat of small sculptures, in which the youth of the region are so\r\nskilled as to distance all competition.\r\n\r\nThe United States must be held to have furnished far less valuable\r\nspecimens of either art or nature than might have been expected; and\r\nthis will be the more evident, as its stall occupies the great\r\ncompartment of the Exhibition adjoining the eastern entrance, and\r\nfirst meeting the eye. France and Germany, especially North Germany,\r\nhold their ground well. One thing, however, seems certain, and the\r\nmore remarkable as it was not altogether expected, which is, that\r\nEngland is not inferior to her competitors in any department. That her\r\nmachinery, and the results of her science and skill in working in\r\nmetals should distance all competition, might have been looked for.\r\nBut what will greatly astonish people, is her very signal success in\r\nso many departments of the ornamental: and whilst of natural\r\nproductions her various colonies have supplied specimens the most\r\nnovel and most startling, the produce of the looms as well as of the\r\nmines of Indostan offer among the most novel and interesting sights\r\nthat the curious could flock to see.\r\n\r\nIn a general way it is not yet possible to guess what effect the\r\nExhibition is likely to have. So many persons will crowd to it with\r\nwidely different views, that it is extremely difficult to sum up its\r\nprobable impression on the whole. But we believe that those most\r\ngratified will be scientific persons, who can see and compare for the\r\nfirst time all raw materials and all finished productions gathered\r\ntogether under the same roof. It is, indeed, as a creator of new\r\ncombinations and of new ideas, that the Great Exhibition must in any\r\npermanent sense be chiefly valuable; for it is hardly conceivable but\r\nthat many most startling inventions in art manufacture must ultimately\r\nspring from it. But these will be silent enjoyments, and for a long\r\ntime secret profits. Those on whose fertile minds the good seed of new\r\nideas may fall, will silently cherish and allow them to germ in the\r\nshade, and years may elapse ere we see the growth or the fruit. What\r\nmeanwhile we may count upon hearing most of for the moment will be the\r\nenjoyment of the curious at the view of the Koh-i-noor, and the other\r\nmere sight-wonders of the Exhibition.\r\n\r\nLet us add that not the least pleasure of this kind is the view which\r\neach race of the human family will be enabled to take of the other.\r\nThe crowds now brought together are essentially, the greater part of\r\nthem, of the middle and artisan class, although it may be generally of\r\nthose already successful and enriched. This is a kind of people that\r\nwould never have come amongst us but upon an occasion such as the\r\npresent, and whom to see and be seen by, cannot but be productive of\r\nlarge, friendly, humane, cosmopolitan results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Leigh Hunt's Journal.\r\n\r\nDR. DAVID STRAUSS IN WEIMAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Visitor's Book of the Elephant Hotel in Weimar contains, under the\r\ndate of the 12th August, a rather remarkable autograph, which the\r\ncurious collector would do well to buy, if possible, or, if not\r\npossible, then to beg or steal. Perhaps, among the many distinguished\r\nnames which the long series of _Fremdenbuecher_ kept at Weimar during\r\nthe last fifty years must necessarily exhibit, there are few to which\r\nan earnest, thinking man would attach the same profound, though\r\nsomewhat painful degree of interest. It is the name of \"_Dr. David\r\nStrauss, aus Ludwigsburg_,\" written by himself.\r\n\r\n\"How!\" you exclaim in a mingled tone of surprise and incredulity, \"Dr.\r\nStrauss in Weimar? David Strauss among the pilgrims to the tomb of the\r\npoets?\"\r\n\r\nIt does sound apocryphal--_mythical_, if you will. One would almost as\r\nsoon expect to hear of the late Dr. Jordan Faust himself paying a\r\nvisit to the ghost of Goethe. Nevertheless, and in spite of all that\r\nlearned critics, a thousand years hence, may advance and prove to the\r\ncontrary, a veritable fact it is, Strauss actually has been among\r\nus--has been seen here in the body during several days by several\r\nwitnesses, the present writer being one.\r\n\r\nIt is my intention here briefly to record the impression which I still\r\nretain of my transient intercourse with this celebrated man. Such a\r\nrecord can scarce be considered as a breach of confidence, an invasion\r\nof the sacred domains of private life: the author of the \"_Leben\r\nJesu_\" is a public, I had almost said, an historical character.\r\n\r\nUp to his arrival in Weimar, my relation to Strauss had been merely of\r\nthat mystic, invisible, and impersonal description, which usually\r\nsubsists between a gifted writer and his readers. But even before I\r\nknew the language, and, by consequence, before I could read the works\r\nof Strauss, I had heard much and often of the young Tubingen\r\ntheologian, who, at the age of twenty-seven years, with all the moral\r\ncourage of a Luther, all the critical skill, and more than all the\r\nlearning of a Lessing, had arisen and _implicitly_ declared to the\r\nwhole German nation, and to the world at large, that their belief\r\nrested on a false basis (in his opinion).\r\n\r\nThough educated in a country where every man reads and reverences his\r\nBible, I had likewise arrived at that, in every sense, _critical_\r\nperiod, which is, I suppose, common to all men of an inquiring\r\ndisposition. I, too, had eaten of the fruit of the tree of\r\nknowledge--had become as a god in my own conceit, knowing good from\r\nevil. I had passed through the French and English schools of\r\nskepticism, with my orthodoxy, if not intact, at least not vitally\r\ninjured. To study Strauss, therefore, seemed a mere matter of course.\r\nWell; I read his celebrated work. It contained nothing absolutely new,\r\neither in assertion or opinion. I had met with the same or similar\r\nelsewhere. And yet the very same _wooden_ arguments I had so often\r\nsmiled at in the writings of the French and English free-thinkers,\r\nseemed here to annihilate me. In vain I said to myself, \"they are\r\nstill wooden!\" Strauss had so sheathed and bound them with his triple\r\nfold of _brass_. In other words, had so supported and confirmed them\r\nwith his unheard-of array of learning, logic, and science; that\r\nnothing, I thought, could resist them. It seemed as if the world-old,\r\nhereditary feud between faith and reason were here to be terminated\r\nfor ever. As I read, the solid earth seemed to be giving way beneath\r\nme; and when I at length closed the ominous volume, I could have\r\nalmost cried out with the chorus in Faust: \"Woe! woe! thou hast\r\nshattered the lovely world!\"\r\n\r\nIt is unusual, I believe, to speak out these bosom secrets in this\r\nway; but I thought it necessary to give you this, by no means\r\nexaggerated description of my first spiritual encounter with the\r\nauthor of the _Leben Jesu_, in order that you might have some idea of\r\nthe feelings with which, on the third morning after his arrival in\r\nWeimar, I received and read the following whimsical note:\r\n\r\n     _Weimar_, 15th August.\r\n\r\n     \"A. S. requests the pleasure of Mr. M----'s company to-day,\r\n     at two o'clock, to soup and Strauss.\"\r\n\r\nHow busily my fancy was employed the whole of that forenoon, I need\r\nnot stop here to tell. Enough, that of all the various pictures she\r\nthen drew for me, not one resembled the pale, the slightly made, and,\r\nbut for a partial stoop, the somewhat tall, half-lay, half-clerical\r\nfigure in spectacles, to whom I was presented on arriving at my\r\nfriend's apartments. This was Strauss himself, whose portrait I may as\r\nwell go on and finish here at once as well as I can, and so have done\r\nwith externals.\r\n\r\nJudging from appearance, Strauss's age might be any where between\r\nforty and fifty. But for his light brown, glossy hair, I should have\r\nsaid nearer the latter than the former. I have since ascertained,\r\nhowever, that he is, or was then, exactly forty-one years of age. His\r\nhead is the very contrary of massive,--as, indeed, his whole figure is\r\nthe opposite of robust or muscular. But it--the head--is of a purely\r\nclassical form, having none of those bumps and extravagant\r\nprotuberances, which phrenologists delight in. His profile, in\r\nparticular, might be called truly Grecian, were it not for the thin\r\nand somewhat pinched lips, which give it an almost ascetical\r\ncharacter. Strange enough, too, this same character of ascetism, or\r\nsomething akin to it, seems likewise indicated by a peculiar\r\nexpression in his otherwise fine, dark-brown eyes. It is not a squint,\r\nas at first sight it appears, but a frequent turning-upward of the\r\neye-balls, like a Methodist at his devotions, which, in Strauss's\r\ncase, is of course involuntary. Perhaps it is to conceal this slight\r\nblemish that he wears spectacles, for his large and lustrous eyes did\r\nnot else appear to need them. I have said that Strauss was slightly\r\nmade; and, in fact, this is so much the case as to suggest the idea of\r\na consumptive habit. Nor do his narrow shoulders and hollow breast,\r\ntogether with a certain swinging serpentine gait when he walks, seem\r\nto contradict the supposition. I have little more to add to this\r\nfeeble sketch of Strauss's outward man; for it would, I suppose, be\r\ntoo trifling a circumstance to mention that I had seldom seen a more\r\n_thorough-bred_ hand and foot than his!\r\n\r\nMy entrance had interrupted a conversation, which Strauss presently\r\nresumed, and which proved to be on the eternal topic of politics. His\r\nvoice was strong and deep, but he spoke (and it seemed to be a habit\r\nwith him) in a subdued tone, and with a very decided Wurtemberg\r\naccent. I was surprised at some of the high-Tory opinions to which he\r\ngave utterance. I had not expected to find the author of the _Leben\r\nJesu_ on the Conservative side of any question. It seemed\r\ninconsistent. But I recollected that the man was now on the wrong side\r\nof forty; and I could not help thinking that if, instead of publishing\r\nhis destructive book at the age of twenty-seven, he had waited with it\r\ntill now, he might possibly have postponed it altogether. At table,\r\nour talk was of the usual commonplace description; and it may be worth\r\nwhile observing, that even Strauss could be commonplace with as good a\r\ngrace as any. Our host and he had, it seems, been fellow-students\r\ntogether, and, of course, there was no want of anecdotes and\r\nreminiscences of those early days, all of which appeared to give him\r\nexquisite pleasure. In particular, I remember that he spoke with much\r\nfervor of the fine mountain scenery in the neighborhood of Heidelberg;\r\nand when a friendly discussion arose amongst us as to whether the\r\nmountains or the ocean were the sublimer spectacle, Strauss argued\r\nwarmly in favor of the former. Some one (myself, I believe) happening\r\nto say that, like Goethe and Schiller, they were both _superlative_,\r\nand not to be _compared_--\"Bravo!\" cried Strauss, and good humoredly\r\ngave up his position. The conversation now naturally turned upon\r\nGoethe, and upon all the localities in and about Weimar, connected\r\nwith his memory. Like a pious pilgrim, as he was, Strauss, as I found,\r\nhad already been to all these places, with the exception of the\r\ngarden-house and garden. It was proposed to conduct him thither\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nThe extreme and almost primitive simplicity of the house in which\r\nGoethe had spent some of the happiest days of his life, seemed to\r\nastonish Strauss. He made few remarks to that effect, however, but\r\nthere was no end to his eager questionings. He touched the walls, the\r\ndoors, the locks--whatever it might be supposed Goethe had touched. He\r\npeeped into every corner, scrutinized even the minutest details; and\r\nall this with the utmost outward composure, so that, if I had not\r\nclosely watched him, it might have escaped my notice! In the garden, I\r\nshowed him Goethe's favorite walk, and some oaks and firs planted by\r\nthe poet's own hand. He gathered an oak-leaf, and put it in his\r\npocket-book. He did the same by the flower of a hollyhock, the only\r\nkind of flower remaining, which plant I knew for certain dated its\r\nexistence from the time of Goethe. The pocket-book was already full of\r\nsuch relics. From this time forth, therefore, let no man say that\r\nStrauss is devoid of veneration! Man was made for adoration. He cannot\r\nhelp it. Pity, only, that he sometimes mistakes the object of it.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while Strauss and I had somehow drawn nearer to each\r\nother, and had begun to hold little dialogues apart together. We\r\ntalked of England, where he had never been,--of English literature,\r\nwhich he knew chiefly through the medium of translation. Shakspeare of\r\ncourse was duly discussed,--for, like all educated Germans, Strauss\r\nwas an enthusiast about Shakspeare. He asked me if I had read\r\nGervinus's new work, and was evidently pleased with the way in which I\r\nspoke of it. By-and-by I ventured to allude to the _Leben Jesu_. It\r\nwas not without considerable hesitation. He seemed, I think, to enjoy\r\nmy embarrassment,--and told me he had seen several specimens of an\r\nEnglish translation of the _Leben Jesu_, which a young lady, a Miss\r\nBrabant, was preparing for publication! There was something\r\n_Mephistophelian_ in the smile with which he told me this. Such a\r\nwork, he continued, was, however, not likely to succeed in England:\r\nfor there was Hennel, who had published an amazingly clever work of\r\nthe same kind in London, and yet the British public seemed to have\r\nmade a point of completely _ignoring_ it. The work had, however, been\r\ntranslated into German, and he (Strauss himself) had written a preface\r\nto it. As I now perceived that the subject was any thing but a\r\ndelicate one with Strauss, I determined upon accepting a proposal he\r\nhad made me to accompany him on the morrow to Doornburg and Jena.\r\nThere were inconsistencies in his system, which I had the vanity to\r\nthink I might convince him of, and a _tete-a-tete_ like the one in\r\nprospect was just what I wanted.\r\n\r\nWe returned to _S--'s_ for tea, with the addition to our party of a\r\ndistinguished philologian of this town, whose presence seemed to call\r\nforth all the intellectual energies of Strauss, so that, in the course\r\nof the evening, I had more than one occasion to admire the variety and\r\ndepth of the man's attainments. It is impossible to recollect every\r\nthing, but what especially excited my attention was, that in a very\r\nlearned discussion concerning the comparative merits of the ancient\r\nand modern drama, Strauss suggested the character and fate of Tiberius\r\nas the best subject for a tragedy in the whole compass of history. I\r\nwas struck, too, and with reason, I think, with a new and flagrant\r\ninstance of the conservative tendency which his mind seems of late to\r\nhave fallen into. In talking of Horace, whose works, and particularly\r\nwhose odes, he appeared to have at his fingers' ends, he defended the\r\nelder state of the texts with amazing pertinacity, treating with\r\ncontempt every change and suggestion of such, which the sacrilegious\r\ncommentators of our times have ventured upon. Such opinions in the\r\nmouth of the author of the _Leben Jesu_ sounded strange enough, and\r\nagain I could not help saying to myself, \"Why the deuce did he publish\r\nthat destructive work of his twenty-seventh year?\"\r\n\r\nThe following day, being prevented by pressing engagements from\r\nleaving town, I prevailed upon Strauss to put off his journey for a\r\nday longer. I saw little of him in the mean time, and had therefore\r\nleisure to bring into some kind of order and method a series of\r\nobjections which I had noted down during a second and more critical\r\nperusal of the _Leben Jesu_. On mature reflection, it had occurred to\r\nme that, after all, the Christian religion had, in the course of\r\neighteen centuries, survived far worse things than even Strauss's\r\nbook. This idea now gave me courage to look this Goliah in the face,\r\nand, though I was but a youth (so to speak), and he a \"man of war,\" to\r\ngo up against him, if occasion offered, even with my \"scrip\" and\r\n\"sling,\" and my \"five smooth stones out of the brook.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning, then, in pursuance of our plan, Strauss and I started\r\nwith the first train for Apolda, whence we went on foot across the\r\nfields to Doornburg. There we breakfasted in Goethe's room, saw the\r\npoet's handwriting on the wall, walked along his favorite\r\nterrace-walk, where I, for the time as much of a hero-worshipper as\r\nStrauss himself, recited aloud the beautiful song, _Da droben auf\r\njenem Berge_, &c., which Goethe is said to have composed on this very\r\nspot. I expected Strauss to be moved almost to tears, instead of which\r\nhe burst out in a most incontrollable fit of laughter, in which I as\r\nincontrollably joined when he told me the cause, which was this:--In\r\nMunich or Ludwigsburg, I forget which, there was once a house of\r\npublic entertainment, called from its sign \"The Lamb's Wool,\" as its\r\nproprietor was called \"The Lamb's Wool landlord.\" This landlord had,\r\nit seems, been one of his own best customers, in consequence of which\r\nhe soon became bankrupt, which sad event a poet of the same town, most\r\nprobably another of the landlord's best customers, commemorated in a\r\nfew stanzas entitled, _Des Lamswollswirthes Klagelied_ (The Host of\r\nthe Lamb's Wool's Lament), a parody on the above song of Goethe's, and\r\nsuggested, doubtless, by these two lines--\r\n\r\n    \"Ich bin _herunter gekommem_,\r\n    Und weiss doch selber nicht wie!\"[9]\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the humor with which Strauss told me this droll\r\nanecdote, and, for my part, I feel that I shall never again be able to\r\nrecite Goethe's pathetic song with becoming gravity.\r\n\r\nFrom Doornburg we walked to Jena, where we arrived to dinner. It\r\nrained torrents, but Strauss was not to be balked of what he came for.\r\nWe trudged like _Schwarmer_ (enthusiasts), as he said, through mud and\r\nrain, to all the Goethe and Schiller relics, the library, the\r\nobservatory, and, last of all, the Princess's garden, where the statue\r\nof the eagle with its three poetical inscriptions long detained us.\r\nReturned to our inn and about to take a final leave of Strauss; now, I\r\nthought, or never, was the time to fulfil the object for which I had\r\naccompanied him thus far. All day, hitherto, our talk had been of the\r\npoets--Greek, Roman, English, and German, and so much erudition,\r\ntaste, and feeling, I had rarely found united. His mind seemed to have\r\nfed on poetry and nothing else; and I know not how it was, but I could\r\nnot till now resolve to speak the word which I knew would disenchant\r\nhim. Now, however, the probability that we should never see each other\r\nagain on this side eternity gave a solemn, perhaps superstitious, turn\r\nto my thoughts. As he sat there in silence before me, like the sphinx\r\nof which he had spoken so mysteriously in descanting that morning on\r\nthe master piece of Sophocles, I felt that now I must speak out, or\r\nelse look to be devoured. I at once entered on the subject, therefore,\r\nand delivered myself of all the objections I had so elaborately\r\narranged and prepared. His answer was evasive; and the topic was\r\nchanged into an argument.\r\n\r\nStrauss was to leave with the diligence at eight o'clock for\r\nRudolstadt. I cordially shook hands with him, bade God bless him, and,\r\nhiring a conveyance, drove directly back to Weimar. On the way home, I\r\nconceived the plan of a poem, which, if it were completed, I would\r\ninsert here. It will probably never be completed. Instead of it,\r\ntherefore, I will communicate something far more interesting--a copy\r\nof verses written by Strauss himself, on returning from his pilgrimage\r\nto the tomb of the poets; and with which I conclude what I had to say\r\nregarding Dr. David Strauss in Weimar.\r\n\r\n[Dr. Strauss, as a poet, being almost a _lusus naturae_, according to\r\nEnglish ideas of him, we have thought it right to translate this\r\npoem. Here, accordingly, is the best English version possible to us in\r\nthe little time allowed by an inexorable printer:--]\r\n\r\n    On pilgrim staff I homeward come,\r\n      Way worn, but still with pleasure warmed;\r\n    At the great prophet's holy tomb,\r\n      The pious rites I have performed.\r\n\r\n    I, in his garden's shady walk,\r\n      Recalled the prints of footsteps lost:\r\n    And from the tree his care had raised,\r\n      I plucked a greeting from his ghost.\r\n\r\n    I saw in letters and in poems,\r\n      His honored hand's laborious toil;\r\n    And many loving recollections,\r\n      Inquiry won me for my spoil.\r\n\r\n    Through every chamber, small and homely,\r\n      With holy reverence did I roam,\r\n    Where oft the gods in radiant concourse\r\n      Came thronging to their loved one's home.\r\n\r\n    By the bed stood I where the poet\r\n      In placid sleep his eyes reposed,\r\n    Till summoned to a nobler being\r\n      For the last time their lids he closed.\r\n\r\n    In reading of the holy places,\r\n      Henceforth have I a doubled zeal,\r\n    I have a being in the writing,\r\n      For all of it I know and feel.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] To explain this joke to the un-Germanized reader, it will be\r\nnecessary to inform him that the title of Goethe's poem is \"The\r\nShepherd's Lament,\" wherein a shepherd, leaving his native hills,\r\ngives a lingering look up at the familiar mountain, and sings\r\nregretfully\r\n\r\n    \"I have to the valley descended,\r\n    And how I cannot tell.\"\r\n\r\n_Herunter kommen_, means also to decline, _to fail_, and upon this\r\nturns the joke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Eliza Cook's Journal\r\n\r\nGREAT MEN'S WIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably, greatness does not conform with domesticity. The literary\r\nman is wrapped up in his books, and the wife does not brook a divided\r\naffection. He lives in the past or the future, and his mind can with\r\ndifficulty be brought to condescend to the carking cares of the\r\npresent--perhaps not even to its quiet daily life. His lofty\r\nmeditations are disturbed by the puling infant, or it may be, by a\r\ncall for house-rent, or the amount of the chandler's bill. Or, take\r\nthe leader of some great political or social movement; or the\r\ncommander of armies, at whose nod ten thousand swords are unsheathed,\r\nand the air made blatant with the discharge of artillery; can you\r\nexpect such a person to subside into the quiet, husband-life, like any\r\ncommon, ordinary man, and condescend to inquire into the state of the\r\nchildren's teething, Johnny's progress at school, and the thousand\r\nlittle domestic attentions which constitute a wife's happiness?\r\n\r\nWe shall not, however, discuss the question of whether happiness in\r\nmarriage be compatible with genius, or not, but proceed to set forth a\r\nfew traits of the wives of great men.\r\n\r\nWe shall not dwell on Xantippe, the wife of Socrates, whose name has\r\nbecome familiar to us almost as a proverb. But she was not without her\r\nuses, for she taught her great husband at least the virtue of\r\npatience. Many of the great Greeks and Romans, like Socrates, were\r\nunhappy in their wives. Possibly, however, we have heard only of the\r\nbad ones among them; for the life of good wives is rarely made matter\r\nof comment by the biographer, either in ancient or modern times.\r\n\r\nThe advent of Christianity placed woman in a greatly improved\r\nposition, as regarded marriage. Repudiation, as among the Greeks and\r\nRomans, was no longer permitted; the new religion enforced the unity\r\nand indissolubility of marriage; it became a sacrament, dispensed at\r\nthe altar, where woman had formerly been a victim, but was now become\r\nan idol. The conjugal union was made a religious contract; the family\r\nwas constituted by the priest; the wife was elevated to the function\r\nof Educator of the Family--the _alma mater_; and thus, through her\r\ninstrumentality, was the regeneration of the world secured.\r\n\r\nBut it did not follow that all women were good, or that all were\r\nhappy. Life is but a tangled yarn at the best; there are blanks and\r\nprizes drawn by women still, and not unfrequently \"great men\" have\r\nproved the greatest of blanks to them. Henry the Eighth was not,\r\nperhaps, entitled to the appellation of a great man, though he was an\r\nauthor, for which the Pope conferred on him the title, still retained\r\nby our monarchs, of \"Defender of the Faith.\" The history of his six\r\nwives is well known. Nor was the married life of Peter the Great, and\r\nhis three wives, of a more creditable complexion.\r\n\r\nLUTHER married Catharine de Bora, an escaped nun--a remarkably\r\nhandsome woman. In his letters to his friends, he spoke of her as \"My\r\nrib Kitty, my loved Kitty, my Empress Kitty.\" A year after his\r\nmarriage, when struggling with poverty, he said, in one of these\r\nletters, \"Catharine, my dear rib, salutes you. She is quite well,\r\nthank God; gentle, obedient, and kind, in all things; quite beyond my\r\nhopes. I would not exchange my poverty with her, for all the riches of\r\nCroesus without her.\" A dozen years after, he said, \"Catharine, thou\r\nhast a pious man, who loves thee; thou art a very empress!\" Yet Luther\r\nhad his little troubles in connection with his married life. Catharine\r\nwas fond of small-talk, and, when Luther was busily engaged in solving\r\nthe difficulties of the Bible, she would interrupt him with such\r\nquestions as--whether the king of France was richer than his cousin\r\nthe emperor of Germany? if the Italian women were more beautiful than\r\nthe German? if Rome was as big as Wittenberg? and so on. To escape\r\nthese little inquiries, Luther saw no other way than to lock himself\r\nup in his study, with a quantity of bread and cheese, and there hold\r\nto his work. But Catharine still pursued him. One day, when he was\r\nthus locked up, laboring at his translation of the twenty-second\r\nPsalm, the door was assailed by the wife. No answer was given. More\r\nknocking followed, accompanied by Catharine's voice, shouting--\"if you\r\ndon't open the door, I will go fetch the locksmith.\" The Doctor\r\nentreated his wife not to interrupt his labors. \"Open! open!\" repeated\r\nCatharine. The doctor obeyed. \"I was afraid,\" said she, on entering,\r\n\"that something had vexed you, locked up in this room alone.\" To which\r\nLuther replied, \"the only thing that vexes me now is yourself.\" But\r\nLuther, doubtless, entertained a steady, though sober affection for\r\nhis wife; and in his will, in which he left her sole executrix,\r\nbequeathing to her all his property, he speaks of her as \"always a\r\ngentle, pious, and faithful wife to me, and that has loved me\r\ntenderly. Whatever,\" he adds, \"may happen to her after my death, I\r\nhave, I say, full confidence that she will ever conduct herself as a\r\ngood mother towards her children, and will conscientiously share with\r\nthem whatever she possesses.\"\r\n\r\nThe great Genevese Reformer, CALVIN, proceeded in his search for a\r\nwife in a matter-of-fact way. He wrote to his friends, describing to\r\nthem what sort of an article he wanted, and they looked up a proper\r\nperson for him. Writing to Farel, one of his correspondents, on this\r\nsubject, he said,--\"I beseech you ever to bear in mind what I seek for\r\nin a wife. I am not one of your mad kind of lovers, who dote even upon\r\nfaults, when once they are taken by beauty of person. The only beauty\r\nthat entices me is, that she be chaste, obedient, humble, economical,\r\npatient; and that there be hopes that she wilt be solicitous about my\r\nhealth. If, therefore, you think it expedient that I should marry,\r\nbestir yourself, lest somebody else anticipate you. But, if you think\r\notherwise, let us drop the subject altogether.\" A rich young German\r\nlady, of noble birth, was proposed; but Calvin objected, on the ground\r\nof the high birth. Another was proposed to him, but another failure\r\nresulted. At last a widow, with a considerable family of children,\r\nOdelette de Bures, the relict of a Strasburg Anabaptist, whom he had\r\nconverted, was discovered, suited to his notions, and he married her.\r\nNothing is said about their wedded life, and, therefore, we presume it\r\nwent on in the quiet, jog-trot way. At her death, he did not shed a\r\ntear; and he spoke of the event only as an ordinary spectator would\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\nThe brothers CORNEILLE married the two sisters Lamperiere; and the\r\nlove of the whole family was cemented by the double union. They lived\r\nin contiguous houses, which opened into each other, and there they\r\nlived in a community of taste and sentiment. They worked together, and\r\nshared each other's fame; the sisters, happy in the love and\r\nadmiration of their husbands, and in each other's sympathy. The poet\r\nRacine was greatly blessed in his wife; she was pious, good,\r\nsweet-tempered, and made his life happy. And yet she had no taste for\r\npoetry, scarcely knowing what verse was; and knew little of her\r\nhusband's great tragedies except by name. She had an utter\r\nindifference for money. One day, Racine brought from Versailles a\r\npurse of a thousand golden louis; and running to his wife, embraced\r\nher: \"Congratulate me,\" said he, \"here is a purse of a thousand louis\r\nthat the king has presented to me!\" She complained to him of one of\r\nthe children, who would not learn his lessons for two days together.\r\n\"Let us talk of that another time,\" said he, \"to-day we give ourselves\r\nup to joy.\" She again reverted to the disobedient child, and requested\r\nthe parent to reprimand him; when Boileau (at whose house she was on a\r\nvisit) lost patience, and cried, \"what insensibility! Can't you think\r\nof a purse of a thousand louis?\" Yet these two characters, though so\r\nopposite, consorted admirably, and they lived long and happily\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nTo please his friends, LA FONTAINE married Mary Hericat, the daughter\r\nof a lieutenant-general. It was a marriage of convenience, and the two\r\npreferred living separate,--he at Paris, she in the country. Once a\r\nyear La Fontaine paid her a visit, in the month of September. If he\r\ndid not see her, he returned home as happy as he had gone. He went\r\nsome other day. Once, when he visited her house, he was told she was\r\nquite well, and he returned to Paris, and told his friends he had not\r\nseen his wife, because he understood she was in very good health. It\r\nwas a state of indifference on both sides. Yet the wife was a woman of\r\nvirtue, beauty, and intelligence; and La Fontaine himself was a man of\r\notherwise irreproachable character. There were many such marriages of\r\nindifference in France in those days. Boileau and Racine both tried to\r\nbring the married pair together, but without success; and, in course\r\nof time La Fontaine almost forgot that he was married.\r\n\r\nMOLIERE was extremely unhappy in his marriage. He espoused an actress,\r\nand she proved a coquette. He became extremely jealous, and, perhaps,\r\nhe had reason. Yet he loved her passionately, and bore long with her\r\nfrailties. He thus himself describes her: \"She has small eyes, but\r\nthey are full of fire, brilliant, and the most penetrating in the\r\nworld. She has a large mouth, but one can discern beauties in it that\r\none does not see in other mouths. Her figure is not large, but easy\r\nand well-proportioned. She affects a _nonchalance_ in her speech and\r\ncarriage; but there is grace in her every act, and an indescribable\r\ncharm about her, by which she never fails to work her way to the\r\nheart. Her mental gifts are exquisite; her conversation is charming,\r\nand, if she be capricious more than any other can be, all sits\r\ngracefully on the beautiful,--one bears any thing from the beautiful.\"\r\nShe was an excellent actress, and was run after by the town. Moliere,\r\nher husband, was neglected by her, and suffered agonies of torture. He\r\nstrove against his passion as long as he could. At last, his patience\r\nwas exhausted, and a separation took place.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing of the married life of SHAKSPEARE; indeed, we know but\r\nlittle of any portion of that great man's life. But we know that he\r\nmarried young, and we know the name of his wife, Anne Hathawaye, the\r\ndaughter of a yeoman, in the neighborhood of Stratford-on-Avon. He was\r\nlittle more than eighteen when he married her, and she was twenty-six.\r\nThe marriage was hastened by circumstances which need not be explained\r\nhere. He seems to have gone alone to London, leaving her with her\r\nlittle family of children at Stratford-on-Avon, (for her name does not\r\nonce appear in his married life;) and yet she survived him seven\r\nyears. In his will he left her only his \"second-best bed.\" Judging\r\nfrom his sonnets one would be disposed to infer that Shakspeare's life\r\nwas not more chaste than that of his age; for we find him, in one of\r\nthese, excusing his friend for robbing him of his mistress,--a married\r\nwoman. One could almost wish, with Mr. Hallam, that Shakspeare had not\r\nwritten many of those sonnets, beautiful in language and imagery\r\nthough they unquestionably are.\r\n\r\nMILTON was three times married,--the first time very unhappily. Mary\r\nPowell was the daughter of a royalist cavalier of Oxfordshire, and\r\nMilton was a zealous republican. He was, moreover, a studious man,\r\nwhereas his wife was possessed by a love of gayety and pleasure. They\r\nhad only been married a month, when she grew tired of the studious\r\nhabits and philosophical seclusion of the republican poet, and\r\nrequested his permission to return to her father's house. She went,\r\nbut refused to return to him, preferring the dissipated society of the\r\nbrawling cavaliers who surrounded her. He beseeched her to come back,\r\nbut she persistently refused, treating his messengers with contumely\r\nand contempt. He bore this for a long time; but at last he grew angry,\r\nand repudiated her. He bethought himself of the social mischiefs\r\nresulting from ill-assorted marriages like his own; and, full of the\r\nsubject, he composed and published his celebrated treatise on divorce.\r\nOn public grounds he pleaded his own cause in this work, which\r\ncontains, perhaps, the finest passages that are to be found in his\r\nprose writings. He proceeded to solicit the hand of another young and\r\nbeautiful lady, the daughter of Dr. Dawes; but his wife, hearing of\r\nthis, became repentant, and, returning to him, fell upon her knees,\r\nand entreated his forgiveness. Milton, like his own Adam, was \"fondly\r\novercome with female charms,\" and consented. Four children were born\r\nto them, but the wife died in child-bed of the fifth infant. It is to\r\nMilton's honor, that he behaved to his deceased wife's relatives with\r\ngreat generosity, when, a short time after, they became involved in\r\nruin in the progress of the civil wars. His second wife, Catharine\r\nWoodcock, also died in child-bed, only a year after marriage. He seems\r\nto have loved her fondly, and most readers will remember his beautiful\r\nsonnet, consecrated to her memory.\r\n\r\nWith his third wife he seems to have lived happily; the young wife\r\ndevoted herself to his necessities--for he was now blind--\"in\r\ndarkness, and with dangers compassed round, and solitude.\"\r\n\r\nDR. RICHARD HOOKER, was very unfortunate in his wife. He was betrayed\r\ninto marrying her by his extraordinary simplicity and ignorance of the\r\nworld. The circumstances connected with the marriage were these:\r\nHaving been appointed to preach at St. Paul's Cross, he went up to\r\nLondon from Oxford, and proceeded to the house set apart for the\r\nreception of the preachers. He was very wet and weary on his arrival,\r\nand experienced much kindness from the housekeeper. She persuaded him\r\nthat he was a man of very tender constitution, and urged that he\r\nought, above all things, to have a wife, to nurse and take care of\r\nhim. She professed to be able to furnish him with such, if he thought\r\nfit to marry. Hooker authorized her to select a wife for him, and the\r\nartful woman presented her own daughter--\"a silly, clownish woman, and\r\nwithal a mere Xantippe.\" Hooker, who had promised to marry whomsoever\r\nshe should select, thought himself bound to marry her, and he did so.\r\nThey led a most uncomfortable life, but he resigned himself as he best\r\ncould, lamenting that \"saints have usually a double share in the\r\nmiseries of this life.\" When Cranmer and Sandys went to see him at his\r\nrectory in Buckinghamshire, they found him reading Horace and tending\r\nsheep, in the absence of the servant. When they were conversing with\r\nhim in the house, his wife would break in upon them, and call him away\r\nto rock the cradle and perform other menial offices. The guests were\r\nglad to get away. This unfortunate wife was long a thorn in his side.\r\n\r\nThe famous Earl of ROCHESTER appears in very favorable light in his\r\nletters to his wife: they are remarkably tender, affectionate, and\r\ngentle. In one of them, he says: \"'Tis not an easy thing to be\r\nentirely happy; but to be kind is very easy, and that is the greatest\r\nmeasure of happiness. I say not this to put you in mind of being kind\r\nto me--you have practised that so long, that I have a joyful\r\nconfidence you will never forget it--but to show that I myself have a\r\nsense of what the method of my life seemed so utterly to contradict.\"\r\n\r\nDRYDEN married Elizabeth Howard, daughter of the Earl of Berkshire.\r\nThe match added little to his wealth, and less to his happiness. It\r\nwas an altogether unhappy union. On one occasion, his wife wished to\r\nbe a book, that she might enjoy more of his company. Dryden's reply\r\nwas: \"Be an almanac, then, my dear, that I may change you once a\r\nyear.\" In his writings afterwards, he constantly inveighed against\r\nmatrimony.\r\n\r\nADDISON also \"married discord in a noble wife.\" He was tutor to the\r\nyoung Earl of Warwick, and aspired to the hand of the Dowager\r\nCountess. She married him, and treated him like a lacquey. She never\r\nsaw in him more than her son's tutor. SWIFT (his contemporary) cruelly\r\nflirted with two admirable women; he heartlessly killed one of them,\r\nand secretly married the other, but never publicly recognized her;\r\nshe, too, shortly after died.\r\n\r\nSTERNE treated his wife with such severity, that she abandoned him,\r\nand took retreat in a convent with her daughter; she never saw him\r\nafter. Who would have suspected this from the author of \"Lefevre\" and\r\n\"The Sentimental Journey?\" FARQUHAR, the play-writer, married, early\r\nin life, a woman who deceived him by pretending to be possessed of a\r\nfortune, and he sunk, a victim to disappointment and over-exertion, in\r\nhis thirtieth year, leaving behind him \"two helpless girls;\" his\r\nwidow died in the utmost indigence.\r\n\r\nThese are rather unhappy instances of the wives of great men; but\r\nthere are others of a happier kind. Indeed we hear but little of the\r\nhappy unions: it is the brawling, rocky brook that is the most noisy:\r\nthe slow, deep waters are dump. Every one will remember the wife of\r\nLord WILLIAM RUSSELL, whose conduct by the side of her husband, on his\r\ntrial, stands out as one of the most beautiful pictures in all\r\nhistory. How devotedly her husband loved her need not be said: when he\r\nhad taken his final farewell, all he could say was: \"The bitterness of\r\ndeath is now past!\" She lived many years after the execution of her\r\nhusband, and a delightful collection of her letters has since been\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nBUNYAN speaks with the greatest tenderness of his wife, who helped to\r\nlead him into the paths of peace. He says: \"My mercy was to light upon\r\na wife, whose father and mother were counted godly: this woman and I,\r\nthough we came together as poor as poor might be (not having so much\r\nhousehold stuff as a dish or a spoon betwixt us both); yet this she\r\nhad for her part, 'The Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven,' and 'The\r\nPractice of Piety,' which her father had left her when he died.\" And\r\nthe perusal of these books, together with his good wife's kindly\r\ninfluence, at last implanted in him strong desires to reform his\r\nvicious life, in which he eventually succeeded.\r\n\r\nPARNELL and STEELE were both happy in their wives. The former married\r\na young woman of beauty and merit, but she lived only a few years, and\r\nhis grief at his loss so preyed on his mind, that he never recovered\r\nhis wonted spirits and health. STEELE'S letters to his wife, both\r\nbefore and after his marriage, are imbued with the most tender\r\nfeeling, and exhibit his affection for her in the most beautiful\r\nlight. YOUNG, the poet, like Dryden and Addison, married into a noble\r\nhouse, espousing the daughter of the Earl of Litchfield; but he was\r\nhappier than they. It was out of the melancholy produced by her death\r\nthat his famous \"Night Thoughts\" took their rise.\r\n\r\nWhen JOHNSON married Mrs. Porter, her age was twice his own; yet the\r\nunion proved a happy one. It was not a love-match, but it was one of\r\ninclination and of reciprocal esteem. Johnson was any thing but\r\ngraceful or attractive, yet he possessed admirable qualities. Mrs.\r\nPorter was rather ungainly; but Johnson was very shortsighted, and\r\ncould not detect personal faults. In his eyes, she was beautiful; and,\r\nin an affectionate epitaph which he devoted to her, he painted her in\r\nglowing colors. Indeed, his writings contain many proofs of the lively\r\nand sincere affection which he entertained for her.\r\n\r\nWhile such have been the wives of a few of the great men of past\r\ntimes, it must be stated that, probably, the greatest of them all led\r\na single life. The greatest of the philosophers were bachelors, such\r\nas Bacon, Newton, Gassendi, Galileo, Descartes, Bayle, Locke,\r\nLeibnitz, Hume, Gibbon; and many poets also as Pope, Goldsmith, and\r\nThompson. Bacon says that wife and children are \"impediments to great\r\nenterprises;\" and that \"certainly the best works, and of greatest\r\nmerit for the public, have proceeded from the unmarried, or childless\r\nmen, which, both in affection and reason, have married and endowed the\r\npublic.\" But these were the words of a bachelor, and, perhaps, not\r\nstrictly correct. The great men of more recent times have generally\r\nbeen married; and, at another time, we shall probably complete this\r\npaper by a brief account of the more distinguished of their wives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LEGEND OF ST. MARY'S.\r\n\r\nBY ALICE CAREY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    One night, when bitterer winds than ours\r\n      On hill-sides and in valleys low,\r\n    Built sepulchres for the dead flowers,\r\n      And buried them in sheets of snow,--\r\n\r\n    When over ledges dark and cold,\r\n      The sweet moon rising high and higher,\r\n    Tipped with a dimly burning gold\r\n      St. Mary's old cathedral spire,--\r\n\r\n    The lamp of the confessional,\r\n      (God grant it did not burn in vain,)\r\n    After the solemn midnight bell,\r\n      Streamed redly through the lattice-pane.\r\n\r\n    And kneeling at the father's feet,\r\n      Whose long and venerable hairs,\r\n    Now whiter than the mountain sleet,\r\n      Could not have numbered half his prayers,\r\n\r\n    Was one--I cannot picture true\r\n      The cherub beauty of his guise;\r\n    Lilies, and waves of deepest blue,\r\n      Were something like his hands and eyes!\r\n\r\n    Like yellow mosses on the rocks,\r\n      Dashed with the ocean's milk-white spray,\r\n    The softness of his golden locks\r\n      About his cheek and forehead lay.\r\n\r\n    Father, thy tresses, silver-sleet,\r\n      Ne'er swept above a form so fair;\r\n    Surely the flowers beneath his feet\r\n      Have been a rosary of prayer!\r\n\r\n    We know not, and we cannot know,\r\n      Why swam those meek blue eyes with tears;\r\n    But surely guilt, or guiltless wo,\r\n      Had bowed him earthward more than years.\r\n\r\n    All the long summer that was gone,\r\n      A cottage maid, the village pride,\r\n    Fainter and fainter smiles had worn,\r\n      And on that very night she died!\r\n\r\n    As soft the yellow moonbeams streamed\r\n      Across her bosom, snowy fair,\r\n    She said, (the watchers thought she dreamed,)\r\n      \"'Tis like the shadow of his hair!\"\r\n\r\n    And they could hear, who nearest came,\r\n      The cross to sign and hope to lend,\r\n    The murmur of another name\r\n      Than that of mother, brother, friend.\r\n\r\n    An hour--and St. Mary's spires,\r\n      Like spikes of flame, no longer glow--\r\n    No longer the confessional fires\r\n      Shine redly on the drifted snow.\r\n\r\n    An hour--and the saints had claimed\r\n      That cottage maid, the village pride;\r\n    And he, whose name in death she named,\r\n      Was darkly weeping by her side.\r\n\r\n    White as a spray-wreath lay her brow\r\n      Beneath the midnight of her hair,\r\n    But all those passionate kisses now\r\n      Wake not the faintest crimson there!\r\n\r\n    Pride, honor, manhood, cannot check\r\n      The vehemence of love's despair--\r\n    No soft hand steals about his neck,\r\n      Or bathes its beauty in his hair!\r\n\r\n    Almost upon the cabin walls\r\n      Wherein the sweet young maiden died,\r\n    The shadow of a castle falls,\r\n      Where for her young lord waits a bride!\r\n\r\n    With clear blue eyes and flaxen hair,\r\n      In her high turret still she sits;\r\n    But, ah! what scorn her ripe lips wear--\r\n      What shadow to her bosom flits!\r\n\r\n    From that low cabin tapers flash,\r\n      And, by the shimmering light they spread,\r\n    She sees beneath its mountain ash,\r\n      Leafless, but all with berries red,\r\n\r\n    Impatient of the unclasped rein,\r\n      A courser that should not be there--\r\n    The silver whiteness of his mane\r\n      Streaming like moonlight on the air!\r\n\r\n    Oh, love! thou art avenged too well--\r\n      The young heart, broken and betrayed,\r\n    Where thou didst meekly, sweetly dwell,\r\n      For all its sufferings is repaid.\r\n\r\n    Not the proud beauty, nor the frown\r\n      Of her who shares the living years\r\n    From her the winding-sheet wraps down,\r\n      Can ever buy away the tears!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Chambers's Edinburgh Journal.\r\n\r\nMARY KINGSFORD.\r\n\r\nFROM RECOLLECTIONS OF A POLICE-OFFICER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the close of 1836, I was hurriedly dispatched to Liverpool for\r\nthe purpose of securing the person of one Charles James Marshall, a\r\ncollecting clerk, who, it was suddenly discovered, had absconded with\r\na considerable sum of money belonging to his employers. I was too\r\nlate--Charles James Marshall having sailed in one of the American\r\nliners the day before my arrival in the northern commercial capital.\r\nThis fact well ascertained, I immediately set out on my return to\r\nLondon. Winter had come upon us unusually early; the weather was\r\nbitterly cold; and a piercing wind caused the snow, which had been\r\nfalling heavily for several hours, to gyrate in fierce, blinding\r\neddies, and heaped it up here and there into large and dangerous\r\ndrifts. The obstruction offered by the rapidly-congealing snow greatly\r\ndelayed our progress between Liverpool and Birmingham; and at a few\r\nmiles only distant from the latter city, the leading engine ran off\r\nthe line. Fortunately, the rate at which we were travelling was a very\r\nslow one, and no accident of moment occurred. Having no luggage to\r\ncare for, I walked on to Birmingham, where I found the parliamentary\r\ntrain just on the point of starting, and with some hesitation, on\r\naccount of the severity of the weather, I took my seat in one of the\r\nthen very much exposed and uncomfortable carriages. We travelled\r\nsteadily and safely, though slowly along, and reached Rugby Station in\r\nthe afternoon, where we were to remain, the guard told us, till a fast\r\ndown-train had passed. All of us hurried as quickly as we could to the\r\nlarge room at this station, where blazing fires and other appliances\r\nsoon thawed the half-frozen bodies, and loosened the tongues of the\r\nnumerous and motley passengers. After recovering the use of my\r\nbenumbed limbs and faculties, I had leisure to look around and survey\r\nthe miscellaneous assemblage about me.\r\n\r\nTwo persons had travelled in the same compartment with me from\r\nBirmingham, whose exterior, as disclosed by the dim light of the\r\nrailway carriage, created some surprise that such finely-attired,\r\nfashionable gentlemen should stoop to journey by the plebeian\r\npenny-a-mile train. I could now observe them in a clearer light, and\r\nsurprise at their apparent condescension vanished at once. To an eye\r\nless experienced than mine in the artifices and expedients familiar to\r\na certain class of \"swells,\" they might perhaps have passed muster for\r\nwhat they assumed to be, especially amidst the varied crowd of a\r\n\"parliamentary;\" but their copper finery could not for a moment impose\r\nupon me. The watch-chains were, I saw, mosaic; the watches, so\r\nfrequently displayed, gilt; eye-glasses the same; the coats,\r\nfur-collared and cuffed, were ill-fitting and second-hand; ditto of\r\nthe varnished boats and renovated velvet waistcoats; while the\r\nluxuriant moustaches and whiskers, and flowing wigs, were unmistakably\r\nmere _pieces d'occasion_--assumed and diversified at pleasure. They\r\nwere both apparently about fifty years of age; one of them perhaps one\r\nor two years less than that. I watched them narrowly, the more so from\r\ntheir making themselves ostentatiously attentive to a young\r\nwoman--girl rather she seemed--of a remarkably graceful figure, but\r\nwhose face I had not yet obtained a glimpse of. They made boisterous\r\nway for her to the fire, and were profuse and noisy in their offers of\r\nrefreshment--all of which, I observed, were peremptorily declined. She\r\nwas dressed in deep, unexpensive mourning; and from her timid gestures\r\nand averted head, whenever either of the fellows addressed her, was,\r\nit was evident, terrified as well as annoyed by their rude and\r\ninsolent notice. I quietly drew near to the side of the fire-place, at\r\nwhich she stood, and with some difficulty obtained a sight of her\r\nfeatures. I was struck with extreme surprise--not so much at her\r\nsingular beauty, as from an instantaneous conviction that she was\r\nknown to me, or at least that I had seen her frequently before, but\r\nwhere or when I could not at all call to mind. Again I looked, and my\r\nfirst impression was confirmed. At this moment the elder of the two\r\nmen I have partially described placed his hand, with a rude\r\nfamiliarity, upon the girl's shoulder, proffering at the same time a\r\nglass of hot brandy and water for her acceptance. She turned sharply\r\nand indignantly away from the fellow; and looking round as if for\r\nprotection, caught my eagerly-fixed gaze.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Waters!\" she said impulsively. \"Oh I am so glad!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"that is certainly my name; but I scarcely\r\nremember----Stand back, fellow!\" I angrily continued, as her\r\ntormentor, emboldened by the spirits he had drank, pressed with a\r\njeering grin upon his face, towards her, still tendering the brandy\r\nand water. \"Stand back!\" He replied by a curse and a threat. The next\r\nmoment his flowing wig was whirling across the room, and he standing\r\nwith his bullet-head bare but for a few locks of iron-gray, in an\r\nattitude of speechless rage and confusion, increased by the peals of\r\nlaughter which greeted his ludicrous, unwigged aspect. He quickly put\r\nhimself in a fighting attitude, and, backed by his companion,\r\nchallenged me to battle. This was quite out of the question; and I was\r\nsomewhat at a loss how to proceed, when the bell announcing the\r\ninstant departure of the train rang out, my furious antagonist\r\ngathered up and adjusted his wig, and we all sallied forth to take our\r\nplaces--the young woman holding fast by my arm, and in a low, nervous\r\nvoice, begging me not to leave her. I watched the two fellows take\r\ntheir seats, and then led her to the hindmost carriage, which we had\r\nto ourselves as far as the next station.\r\n\r\n\"Are Mrs. Waters and Emily quite well?\" said the young woman, coloring\r\nand lowering her eyes beneath my earnest gaze, which she seemed for a\r\nmoment to misinterpret.\r\n\r\n\"Quite--entirely so,\" I almost stammered. \"You know us, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely I do,\" she replied, reassured by my manner. \"But you, it\r\nseems,\" she presently added with a winning smile, \"have quite\r\nforgotten little Mary Kingsford.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mary Kingsford!\" I exclaimed almost with a shout. \"Why, so it is! But\r\nwhat a transformation a few years have effected!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so! Not _pretty_ Mary Kingsford now, then?\" she added\r\nwith a light, pleasant laugh.\r\n\r\n\"You know what I mean, you vain creature!\" I rejoined; for I was\r\noverjoyed at meeting with the gentle, well-remembered playmate of my\r\nown eldest girl. We were old familiar friends--almost father and\r\ndaughter--in an instant.\r\n\r\nLittle Mary Kingsford, I should state, was, when I left Yorkshire, one\r\nof the prettiest, most engaging children I had ever seen; and a petted\r\nfavorite not only with us, but of every other family in the\r\nneighborhood. She was the only child of Philip and Mary Kingsford--a\r\nhumble, worthy, and much-respected couple. The father was gardener to\r\nSir Pyott Dalzell, and her mother eked out his wages to a respectable\r\nmaintenance by keeping a cheap children's school. The change which a\r\nfew years had wrought in the beautiful child was quite sufficient to\r\naccount for my imperfect recognition of her; but the instant her name\r\nwas mentioned, I at once recognised the rare comeliness which had\r\ncharmed us all in her childhood. The soft brown eyes were the same,\r\nthough now revealing profounder depths, and emitting a more pensive\r\nexpression; the hair, though deepened in color, was still golden; her\r\ncomplexion, lit up as it now was by a sweet blush, was brilliant as\r\never; whilst her child-person had became matured and developed into\r\nwomanly symmetry and grace. The brilliancy of color vanished from her\r\ncheek as I glanced meaningly at her mourning dress.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she murmured in a sad quivering voice--\"yes, father is gone! It\r\nwill be six months next Thursday, that he died! Mother is well,\" she\r\ncontinued more cheerfully, after a pause: \"in health, but poorly off;\r\nand I--and I,\" she added with a faint effort at a smile, \"am going to\r\nLondon to seek my fortune!\"\r\n\r\n\"To seek your fortune!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; you know my cousin, Sophy Clark? In one of her letters, she said\r\nshe often saw you.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded without speaking. I knew little of Sophia Clarke, except that\r\nshe was the somewhat gay, coquettish shopwoman of a highly-respectable\r\nconfectioner in the Strand, whom I shall call by the name of Morris.\r\n\r\n\"I am to be Sophy's assistant,\" continued Mary Kingsford; \"not of\r\ncourse at first at such good wages as she gets. So lucky for me, is it\r\nnot, since I _must_ go to service? And so kind, too, of Sophy, to\r\ninterest herself for me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it may be so. But surely I have heard--my wife at least\r\nhas--that you and Richard Westlake were engaged? Excuse me, I was not\r\naware the subject was a painful or unpleasant one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Richard's father,\" she replied with some spirit, \"has higher views\r\nfor his son. It is all off between us now,\" she added; \"and perhaps it\r\nis for the best that it should be so.\"\r\n\r\nI could have rightly interpreted these words without the aid of the\r\npartially-expressed sigh which followed them. The perilous position of\r\nso attractive, so inexperienced, so guileless a young creature, amidst\r\nthe temptations and vanities of London, so painfully impressed and\r\npreoccupied me, that I scarcely uttered another word till the\r\nrapidly-diminishing rate of the train announced that we neared a\r\nstation, after which it was probable we should have no farther\r\nopportunity for private conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Those men--those fellows at Rugby--where did you meet with them?\" I\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty or forty miles below Birmingham, where they entered the car in\r\nwhich I was seated. At Birmingham I managed to avoid them.\"\r\n\r\nLittle more passed between us till we reached London. Sophia Clark\r\nreceived her cousin at the Euston station, and was profuse of\r\nfelicitations and compliments upon her arrival and personal\r\nappearance. After receiving a promise from Mary Kingsford to call and\r\ntake tea with my wife and her old playmate, on the following Sunday, I\r\nhanded the two young women into a cab in waiting, and they drove off.\r\nI had not moved away from the spot when a voice, a few paces behind\r\nme, which I thought I recognised, called out; \"Quick, coachee, or\r\nyou'll lose sight of them!\" As I turned quickly round, another cab\r\ndrove smartly off, which I followed at a run. I found, on reaching\r\nLower Seymour Street, that I was not mistaken as to the owner of the\r\nvoice, nor of his purpose. The fellow I had unwigged at Rugby thrust\r\nhis body half out of the cab window, and pointing to the vehicle which\r\ncontained the two girls, called out to the driver \"to mind and make no\r\nmistake.\" The man nodded intelligence, and lashed his horse into a\r\nfaster pace. Nothing that I might do could prevent the fellows from\r\nascertaining Mary Kingsford's place of abode; and as that was all\r\nthat, for the present at least, need be apprehended, I desisted from\r\npursuit, and bent my steps homewards.\r\n\r\nMary Kingsford kept her appointment on the Sunday, and in reply to our\r\nquestioning, said she liked her situation very well. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nMorris were exceedingly kind to her; so was Sophia. \"Her cousin,\" she\r\nadded in reply to a look which I could not repress, \"was perhaps a\r\nlittle gay and free of manner, but the best-hearted creature in the\r\nworld.\" The two fellows who had followed them had, I found, already\r\ntwice visited the shop; but their attentions appeared now to be\r\nexclusively directed towards Sophia Clarke, whose vanity they not a\r\nlittle gratified. The names they gave were Hartley and Simpson. So\r\nentirely guileless and unsophisticated was the gentle country maiden,\r\nthat I saw she scarcely comprehended the hints and warnings which I\r\nthrew out. At parting, however, she made me a serious promise that she\r\nwould instantly apply to me should any difficulty or perplexity\r\novertake her.\r\n\r\nI often called in at the confectioner's, and was gratified to find\r\nthat Mary's modest propriety of behavior, in a somewhat difficult\r\nposition, had gained her the good will of her employers, who\r\ninvariably spoke of her with kindness and respect. Nevertheless, the\r\ncare of a London life, with its incessant employment and late hours,\r\nsoon, I perceived, began to tell upon her health and spirits; and it\r\nwas consequently with pleasure I heard from my wife that she had seen\r\na passage in a letter from Mary's mother, to the effect that the elder\r\nWestlake was betraying symptoms of yielding to the angry and\r\npassionate expostulations of his only son, relative to the engagement\r\nwith Mary Kingsford. The blush with which she presented the letter\r\nwas, I was told, eloquent.\r\n\r\nOne evening, on passing Morris's shop, I observed Hartley and Simpson\r\nthere. They were swallowing custards and other confectionary with much\r\ngusto; and, from their new and costly habiliments, seemed to be in\r\nsurprisingly good case. They were smiling at the cousins with rude\r\nconfidence; and Sophia Clarke, I was grieved to see, repaid their\r\ninsulting impertinence by her most elaborate graces. I passed on; and\r\npresently meeting with a brother-detective, who, it struck me, might\r\nknow something of the two gentlemen, I turned back with him, and\r\npointed them out. A glance sufficed him.\r\n\r\n\"Hartley and Simpson you say?\" he remarked after we had walked away to\r\nsome distance: \"those are only two of their numerous _aliases_. I\r\ncannot, however, say that I am as yet on very familiar terms with\r\nthem; but as I am especially directed to cultivate their acquaintance,\r\nthere is no doubt we shall be more intimate with each other before\r\nlong. Gamblers, blacklegs, swindlers, I already know them to be; and I\r\nwould take odds they are not unfrequently something more, especially\r\nwhen fortune and the bones run cross with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"They appear in high feather just now,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; they are connected, I suspect, with the gang who cleaned out\r\nyoung Garslade last week in Jermyn Street. I'd lay a trifle,\" he added\r\nas I turned to leave him, \"that one or both of them will wear the\r\nQueen's livery, gray, turned up with yellow, before many weeks are\r\npast. Good-by.\"\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight after this conversation, with my wife I paid a visit\r\nto Astley's, for the gratification of our youngsters, who had long\r\nbeen promised a sight of the equestrian marvels at that celebrated\r\namphitheatre. It was the latter end of February; and when we came out,\r\nwe found the weather changed; dark and sleety, with a sharp, nipping\r\nwind. I had to call at Scotland-Yard; my wife and children\r\nconsequently proceeded home in a cab without me; and after assisting\r\nto quell a slight disturbance originating in a gin-palace close by, I\r\nwent on my way over Westminister Bridge. The inclement weather had\r\ncleared the streets and thoroughfares in a surprisingly short time; so\r\nthat, excepting myself, no foot-passenger was visible on the bridge\r\ntill I had about halfcrossed it, when a female figure, closely muffled\r\nup about the head, and sobbing bitterly, passed rapidly by on the\r\nopposite side. I turned and gazed after the retreating figure; it was\r\na youthful, symmetrical one; and after a few moments' hesitation, I\r\ndetermined to follow at a distance, and as unobservedly as I could. On\r\nthe woman sped, without pause or hesitation, till she reached\r\nAstley's, where I observed her stop suddenly, and toss her arms in the\r\nair with a gesture of desperation. I quickened my steps, which she\r\nobserving, uttered a slight scream, and darted swiftly off again,\r\nmoaning as she ran. The momentary glimpse I had obtained of her\r\nfeatures, suggested a frightful apprehension, and I followed at my\r\nutmost speed. She turned at the first cross-street, and I should soon\r\nhave overtaken her, but that in darting round the corner where she\r\ndisappeared, I ran butt against a stout, elderly gentleman, who was\r\nhurrying smartly along out of the weather. With the suddenness of the\r\nshock and the slipperiness of the pavement, down we both reeled; and\r\nby the time we regained our feet, and growled savagely at each other,\r\nthe young woman, whoever she was, had disappeared, and more than half\r\nan hour's eager search after her proved fruitless. At last I bethought\r\nme of hiding at one corner of Westminster Bridge. I had watched\r\nimpatiently for about twenty minutes, when I observed the object of my\r\npursuit stealing timidly and furtively towards the bridge on the\r\nopposite side of the way. As she came nearly abreast of where I stood,\r\nI darted forward; she saw, without recognizing me, and uttered an\r\nexclamation of terror, flew down towards the river, where a number of\r\npieces of balk and other timber were fastened together, forming a kind\r\nof loose raft. I followed with haste, for I saw that it was indeed\r\nMary Kingsford and loudly called to her to stop. She did not seem to\r\nhear me, and in a few moments the unhappy girl had gained the end of\r\nthe timber raft. One instant she paused, with clasped hands, upon the\r\nbrink, and in another had thrown herself into the dark and moaning\r\nriver. On reaching the spot where she had disappeared, I could not at\r\nfirst see her in consequence of the dark mourning dress she had on.\r\nPresently I caught sight of her, still upborne by her spread clothes,\r\nbut already carried by the swift current beyond my reach. The only\r\nchance was to crawl along a piece of round timber which projected\r\nfarther into the river and by the end of which she must pass. This I\r\neffected with some difficulty; and laying myself out at full length,\r\nvainly endeavored with outstretched, straining arms, to grasp her\r\ndress. There was nothing left for it but to plunge in after her. I\r\nwill confess that I hesitated to do so. I was encumbered with a heavy\r\ndress, which there was no time to put off, and moreover, like most\r\ninland men, I was but an indifferent swimmer. My indecision quickly\r\nvanished. The wretched girl, though gradually sinking, had not yet\r\nuttered a cry or appeared to struggle; but when the chilling waters\r\nreached her lips, she seemed to suddenly revive to a consciousness of\r\nthe horror of her fate; she fought wildly with the engulfing tide, and\r\nshrieked for help. Before one could count ten, I grasped her by the\r\narm, and lifted her head above the surface of the river. As I did so,\r\nI felt as if suddenly encased and weighed down by leaden garments, so\r\nquickly had my thick clothing and high boots sucked in the water.\r\nVainly, thus burdened and impeded, did I endeavor to regain the raft;\r\nthe strong tide bore us outwards, and I glared round, in inexpressible\r\ndismay, for some means of extrication from the frightful peril in\r\nwhich I found myself involved. Happily, right in the direction the\r\ntide was drifting us, a large barge lay moored by a chain-cable. I\r\nseized and twined one arm firmly round it, and thus partially secure,\r\nhallooed with renewed power for assistance. It soon came; a passer had\r\nwitnessed the flight of the girl, and my pursuit, and was already\r\nhastening with others to our assistance. A wherry was unmoored; guided\r\nby my voice, they soon reached us; and but a brief interval elapsed\r\nbefore we were safely housed in an adjoining tavern.\r\n\r\nA change of dress, with which the landlord kindly supplied me, a\r\nblazing fire, and a couple of glasses of hot brandy and water, soon\r\nrestored warmth and vigor to my chilled and partially benumbed limbs;\r\nbut more than two hours elapsed before Mary, who had swallowed a good\r\ndeal of water, was in a condition to be removed. I had just sent for a\r\ncab, when two police officers, well known to me, entered the room with\r\nofficial briskness. Mary screamed, staggered towards me, and clinging\r\nto my arm, besought me with frantic earnestness to save her.\r\n\r\n\"What _is_ the meaning of this?\" I exclaimed, addressing one of the\r\npolice officers.\r\n\r\n\"Merely,\" said he, \"that the young woman that's clinging so tight to\r\nyou has been committing an audacious robbery\"----\r\n\r\n\"No--no--no!\" broke in the terrified girl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! of course you'll say so,\" continued the officer. \"All I know is,\r\nthat the diamond brooch was found snugly hid away in her own box. But\r\ncome, we have been after you for the last three hours; so you had\r\nbetter come along at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Save me!--save me!\" she sobbed, tightening her grasp upon my arm and\r\nlooking with beseeching agony in my face.\r\n\r\n\"Be comforted,\" I whispered; \"you shall go home with me. Calm\r\nyourself, Miss Kingsford,\" I added in a louder tone: \"I no more\r\nbelieve you have stolen a diamond brooch than that I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless you!--bless you!\" she gasped in the intervals of her convulsive\r\nsobs.\r\n\r\n\"There is some wretched misapprehension in this business, I am quite\r\nsure,\" I continued; \"but at all events I shall bail her--for this\r\nnight at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bail her! That is hardly regular.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but you will tell the superintendent that Mary Kingsford is in my\r\ncustody, and that I answer for appearance to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe men hesitated; but I stood too well at head-quarters for them to\r\ndo more than hesitate; and the cab I had ordered being just then\r\nannounced, I passed with Mary out of the room as quickly as I could,\r\nfor I feared her senses were again leaving her. The air revived her\r\nsomewhat, and I lifted her into the cab, placing myself beside her.\r\nShe appeared to listen in fearful doubt whether I should be allowed to\r\ntake her with me; and it was not till the wheels had made a score of\r\nrevolutions that her fears vanished; then throwing herself upon my\r\nneck in an ecstacy of gratitude, she burst into tears, and continued\r\ntill we reached home crying on my bosom like a broken-hearted child.\r\nShe had, I found, been there about ten o'clock to seek me, and being\r\ntold that I was gone to Astley's, had started off to find me there.\r\n\r\nShe still slept, or at least she had not risen when I left home the\r\nfollowing morning to endeavor to get at the bottom of the strange\r\naccusation preferred against her. I first saw the superintendent, who,\r\nafter hearing what I had to say, quite approved of all I had done, and\r\nintrusted the case entirely to my care. I next saw Mr. and Mrs. Morris\r\nand Sophia Clarke, and then waited upon the prosecutor, a youngish\r\ngentleman by the name of Saville, lodging in Essex Street, Strand. One\r\nor two things I heard, made necessary a visit to other officers of\r\npolice, incidentally, as I found, mixed up with the affair. By the\r\ntime all this was done, and an effectual watch had been placed upon\r\nMr. Augustus Saville's movements, evening had fallen, and I wended my\r\nway homewards, both to obtain a little rest, and to hear Mary\r\nKingsford's version of the story.\r\n\r\nThe result of my inquiries may be thus summed up. Ten days before.\r\nSophia Clarke told her cousin that she had orders for Covent-Garden\r\nTheatre; and as it was not one of their busy nights, she thought they\r\nmight obtain leave to go. Mary expressed her doubt of this, as both\r\nMr. and Mrs. Morris, who were strict and somewhat fanatical\r\nDissenters, disapproved of play-going, especially for young women.\r\nNevertheless Sophia asked, informed Mary that the required permission\r\nhad been readily accorded, and off they went in high spirits; Mary\r\nespecially, who had never been to a theatre in her life before. When\r\nthere they were joined by Hartley and Simpson, much to Mary's\r\nannoyance and vexation, especially as she saw that her cousin expected\r\nthem. She had, in fact, accepted the orders from them. At the\r\nconclusion of the entertainments, they all four came out together,\r\nwhen suddenly there arose a hustling and confusion, accompanied with\r\nloud outcries, and a violent swaying to and fro of the crowd. The\r\ndisturbance was, however, soon quelled; and Mary and her cousin had\r\nreached the outer door, when two police-officers seized Hartley and\r\nhis friend, and insisted upon their going with them. A scuffle ensued;\r\nbut other officers being at hand, the two men were secured, and\r\ncarried off. The cousins, terribly frightened, called a coach, and\r\nwere very glad to find themselves safe at home again. And now it came\r\nout that Mr. and Mrs. Morris had been told that they were going to\r\nspend the evening at _my_ house, and had no idea they were going to\r\nthe play! Vexed as Mary was at the deception, she was too kindly\r\ntempered to refuse to keep her cousin's secret; especially knowing as\r\nshe did that the discovery of the deceit Sophia had practised would in\r\nall probability be followed by her immediate discharge. Hartley and\r\nhis friend swaggered on the following afternoon into the shop, and\r\nwhispered Sophia that their arrest by the police had arisen from a\r\nstrange mistake, for which the most ample apologies had been offered\r\nand accepted. After this matters went on as usual, except that Mary\r\nperceived a growing insolence and familiarity in Hartley's manner\r\ntowards her. His language was frequently quite unintelligible, and\r\nonce he asked her plainly \"if she did not mean that he should go\r\n_shares_ in the prize she had lately found?\" Upon Mary replying that\r\nshe did not comprehend him, his look became absolutely ferocious, and\r\nhe exclaimed; \"Oh, that's your game, is it? But don't try it on with\r\nme, my good girl, I advise you.\" So violent did he become, that Mr.\r\nMorris was attracted by the noise, and ultimately bundled him, neck\r\nand heels, out of the shop. She had not seen either him or his\r\ncompanion since.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the previous day, a gentleman whom she never\r\nremembered to have seen before, entered the shop, took a seat, and\r\nhelped himself to a tart. She observed that after a while he looked at\r\nher very earnestly, and at length approaching quite close, said, \"You\r\nwere at Covent-Garden Theatre last Tuesday evening week?\" Mary was\r\nstruck, as she said, all of a heap, for both Mr. and Mrs. Morris were\r\nin the shop, and heard the question.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, no! you mistake,\" she said hurriedly, and feeling at the same\r\ntime her cheeks kindle into flame.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but you were though,\" rejoined the gentleman. And then lowering\r\nhis voice to a whisper, he said, \"And let me advise you, if you would\r\navoid exposure and consign punishment, to restore me the diamond\r\nbrooch you robbed me of on that evening.\"\r\n\r\nMary screamed with terror, and a regular scene ensued. She was obliged\r\nto confess she had told a falsehood in denying she was at the theatre\r\non the night in question, and Mr. Morris after that seemed inclined to\r\nbelieve any thing of her. The gentleman persisted in his charge; but\r\nat the same time vehemently iterating his assurance that all he wanted\r\nwas his property; and it was ultimately decided that Mary's boxes, as\r\nwell as her person should be searched. This was done; and to her utter\r\nconsternation the brooch was found concealed, they said, in a black\r\nsilk reticule. Denials, asseverations, were in vain. Mr. Saville\r\nidentified the brooch, but once more offered to be content with its\r\nrestoration. This Mr. Morris, a just, stern man, would not consent to,\r\nand he went out to summon a police-officer. Before he returned, Mary,\r\nby the advice of both her cousin and Mrs. Morris, had fled the house,\r\nand hurried in a state of distraction to find me, with what result the\r\nreader already knows.\r\n\r\n\"It is a wretched business,\" I observed to my wife, as soon as Mary\r\nKingsford had retired to rest, at about nine o'clock in the evening.\r\n\"Like you, I have no doubt of the poor girl's perfect innocence; but\r\nhow to establish it by satisfactory evidence is another matter. I must\r\ntake her to Bow Street the day after to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God, how dreadful! Can nothing be done? What does the prosecutor\r\nsay the brooch is worth?\"\r\n\r\n\"His uncle, he says, gave a hundred and twenty guineas for it. But\r\nthat signifies little, for were its worth only a hundred and twenty\r\nfarthings, compromise is, you know, out of the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not mean that. Can you show it me? I am a pretty good judge of\r\nthe value of jewels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you can see it.\" I took it out of the desk in which I had locked\r\nit up, and placed it before her. It was a splendid emerald, encircled\r\nby large brilliants.\r\n\r\nMy wife twisted and turned it about, holding it in all sorts of\r\nlights, and at last said, \"I do not believe that either the emerald\r\nor the brilliants are real--that the brooch is, in fact, worth twenty\r\nshillings intrinsically.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you say so?\" I exclaimed, as I jumped up from my chair, for my\r\nwife's words gave color and consistence to a dim and faint suspicion\r\nwhich had crossed my mind. \"Then this Saville is a manifest liar, and\r\nperhaps confederate with----But give me my hat: I will ascertain this\r\npoint at once.\"\r\n\r\nI hurried to a jeweller's shop, and found that my wife's opinion was\r\ncorrect. Apart from the workmanship, which was very fine, the brooch\r\nwas valueless. Conjectures, suspicions, hopes, fears, chased each\r\nother with bewildering rapidity through my brain, and in order to\r\ncollect and arrange my thoughts, I stepped out of the whirl of the\r\nstreets into Dolly's Chop-house, and decided, over a quiet glass of\r\nnegus, upon my plan of operations.\r\n\r\nThe next morning there appeared at the top of the second column of the\r\n\"Times\" an earnest appeal, worded with careful obscurity, so that only\r\nthe person to whom it was addressed should easily understand it, to\r\nthe individual who had lost or been robbed of a false stone and\r\nbrilliants at the theatre, to communicate with a certain person--whose\r\naddress I gave--without delay, in order to save the reputation,\r\nperhaps the life, of an innocent person.\r\n\r\nI was at the address I had given by nine o'clock. Several hours passed\r\nwithout bringing any one, and I was beginning to despair, when a\r\ngentleman of the name of Bagshawe was announced: I fairly leaped for\r\njoy, for this was beyond my hopes.\r\n\r\nA gentleman presently entered, of about thirty years of age, of a\r\ndistinguished, though somewhat dissipated aspect.\r\n\r\n\"This brooch is yours?\" said I, exhibiting it without delay or\r\npreface.\r\n\r\n\"It is; and I am here to know what your singular advertisement means.\"\r\n\r\nI briefly explained the situation of affairs.\r\n\r\n\"The rascals!\" he broke in, almost before I had finished. \"I will\r\nbriefly explain it all. A fellow of the name of Hartley, at least that\r\nwas the name he gave, robbed me, I was pretty sure, of this brooch. I\r\npointed him out to the police, and he was taken into custody; but\r\nnothing being found upon him, he was discharged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not entirely, Mr. Bagshawe, on that account. You refused, when\r\narrived at the station-house, to state what you had been robbed of;\r\nand you, moreover, said, in presence of the culprit, that you were to\r\nembark with your regiment for India the next day. That regiment, I\r\nhave ascertained, did embark, as you said it would.\"\r\n\r\n\"True; but I had leave of absence, and shall take the overland route.\r\nThe truth is, that during the walk to the station-house, I had leisure\r\nto reflect, that if I made a formal charge, it would lead to awkward\r\ndisclosures, This brooch is an imitation of one presented me by a\r\nvalued relative. Losses at play--since, for this unfortunate young\r\nwoman's sake, I _must_ out with it--obliged me to part with the\r\noriginal; and I wore this, in order to conceal the fact from my\r\nrelative's knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"This will, sir,\" I replied, \"prove, with a little management, quite\r\nsufficient for all purposes. You have no objection to accompany me to\r\nthe superintendent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least: only I wish the devil had the brooch, as well as\r\nthe fellow that stole it.\"\r\n\r\nAbout half-past five o'clock on the same evening, the street-door was\r\nquietly opened by the landlord of the house in which Mr. Saville\r\nlodged, and I walked into the front room on the first floor, where I\r\nfound the gentleman I sought languidly reclining on a sofa. He\r\ngathered himself smartly up at my appearance, and looked keenly in my\r\nface. He did not appear to like what he read there.\r\n\r\n\"I did not expect to see you to-day,\" he said, at last.\r\n\r\n\"No, perhaps not: but I have news for you. Mr. Bagshawe, the owner of\r\nthe hundred-and-twenty guinea brooch your deceased uncle gave you, did\r\n_not_ sail for India, and--\"\r\n\r\nThe wretched cur, before I could conclude, was on his knees, begging\r\nfor mercy with disgusting abjectness. I could have spurned the\r\nscoundrel where he crawled.\r\n\r\n\"Come, sir!\" I cried, \"let us have no snivelling or humbug: mercy is\r\nnot in my power, as you ought to know. Strive to deserve it. We want\r\nHartley and Simpson, and cannot find them: you must aid us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes; to be sure I will,\" eagerly rejoined the rascal. \"I will go\r\nfor them at once,\" he added, with a kind of hesitating assurance.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! _Send_ for them, you mean. Do so, and I will wait their\r\narrival.\"\r\n\r\nHis note was despatched by a sure hand; and meanwhile I arranged the\r\ndetails of the expected meeting. I, and a friend, whom I momently\r\nexpected, would ensconce ourselves behind a large screen in the room,\r\nwhile Mr. Augustus Saville would run playfully over the charming plot\r\nwith his two friends, so that we might be able to fully appreciate its\r\nmerits. Mr. Saville agreed. I rang the bell, an officer appeared, and\r\nwe took our posts in readiness. We had scarcely done so, when the\r\nstreet-bell rang, and Saville announced the arrival of his\r\nconfederates. There was a twinkle in the fellow's green eyes which I\r\nthought I understood. \"Do not try that on, Mr. Augustus Saville,\" I\r\nquietly remarked: \"we are but two here, certainly, but there are\r\nhalf-a-dozen in waiting below.\"\r\n\r\nNo more was said, and in another minute the friends met. It was a\r\nboisterously jolly meeting, as far as shaking hands and mutual\r\nfelicitations on each other's good looks and health went. Saville was,\r\nI thought, the most obstreperously gay of all three.\r\n\r\n\"And yet, now I look at you, Saville, closely,\" said Hartley, \"you\r\ndon't look quite the thing. Have you seen a ghost?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but this cursed brooch affair worries me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!--humbug!--it's all right: we are all embarked in the same\r\nboat. It's a regular three-handed game. I prigged it; Simmy here\r\nwhipped it into pretty Mary's reticule, which she, I suppose, never\r\nlooked into till the row came; and _you_ claimed it--a regular\r\nmerry-go-round, eh? Ha! ha! ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so, Mr. Hartley,\" said I, suddenly facing him, and at the same\r\ntime stamping on the floor; \"as you say, a delightful merry-go-round;\r\nand here, you perceive, I added, as the officers crowded into the\r\nroom, are more gentlemen to join in it.\"\r\n\r\nI must not stain the paper with the curses, imprecations, blasphemies,\r\nwhich for a brief space resounded through the apartment. The rascals\r\nwere safely and separately locked up a quarter of an hour afterwards;\r\nand before a month had passed away, all three were transported. It is\r\nscarcely necessary to remark, that they believed the brooch to be\r\ngenuine, and of great value.\r\n\r\nMary Kingsford did not need to return to her employ. Westlake the\r\nelder withdrew his veto upon his son's choice, and the wedding was\r\ncelebrated in the following May with great rejoicing; Mary's old\r\nplaymate officiating as bridesmaid, and I as bride's-father. The still\r\nyoung couple have now a rather numerous family, and a home blessed\r\nwith affection, peace, and competence. It was some time, however,\r\nbefore Mary recovered from the shock of her London adventure; and I am\r\npretty sure that the disagreeable reminiscences inseparately connected\r\nin her mind with the metropolis will prevent at least _one_ person\r\nfrom being present at the World's Great Fair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Historical Review of the Month._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nOur record of home affairs for the past month presents several points\r\nof more than usual interest. Two different movements, both of which\r\noriginated in the Southern States, kept awake the public curiosity for\r\nthree or four weeks past, though at the time these sheets are going\r\nthrough the press both appear to be rapidly subsiding.\r\n\r\nSoon after the withdrawal of the Government prosecution against Gen.\r\nHenderson, Lopez, Gen. Quitman, and the other persons arraigned for\r\ntrial as having been engaged in getting up a hostile expedition\r\nagainst Cuba, rumors of a second attempt being in preparation, began\r\nto be circulated through the country. Little attention was at first\r\npaid to these rumors, but the matter soon assumed a more definite\r\nshape, and the Southern newspapers began to notice the congregation of\r\nsuspicious persons at different points on or near the coast. From the\r\nintelligence which the Government received, it became evident that an\r\nextensive expedition, was on foot, the object of which was the\r\ninvasion of Cuba. The United States officers were ordered to be on the\r\nwatch, for the purpose of obtaining more particular intelligence of\r\nits movements.\r\n\r\nTwo or three thousand men had collected in the neighborhood of\r\nJacksonville, Florida, which had been selected as the principal\r\nrendezvous of the expedition. These men awaited the arrival of a\r\nsteamer from New-York, which had been chartered by parties there. The\r\nGovernment, however, had already received intelligence of their plans,\r\nand instructions were at once sent to the United States Marshal at\r\nNew-York, to prevent the departure of the steamer. This officer,\r\naccompanied by a police force, sailed down the bay in search of the\r\nsuspected craft. In the mean time it was found that the steamer\r\nCleopatra, a large boat, formerly employed on the Sound as a passenger\r\nboat, was the vessel indicated. She was then lying at one of the piers\r\non the North River, and was immediately seized and placed under the\r\nsupervision of the United States authorities. She was alleged to be\r\nbound to Galveston, Texas. A large quantity of coal was found on\r\nboard, and a great number of water casks, and but few arms or\r\nammunition of any kind. A file of marines from the Navy Yard was\r\nplaced on board, and all communication with the shore forbidden. No\r\nfinal disposition has yet been made of the vessel, though orders were\r\nreceived to deliver her cargo to any person who may establish his\r\nownership to the articles found on board.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, notice was received by the Marshal that a number of\r\nGermans and others had assembled at South Amboy for the purpose of\r\nembarking on some secret expedition, and one of the Deputy Marshals\r\nwas sent there for the purpose of procuring information. Disguising\r\nhimself as a German emigrant, he obtained sufficient evidence to\r\nwarrant the arrest of the following six persons: William T. Rogers,\r\nJr., John L. O'Sullivan, Capt. Lewis, of the steamboat Creole, a\r\nmember of the former expedition; Major Louis Schlesinger, one of the\r\nHungarian refugees; Pedro Sanchez Yznaga, a Cuban refugee; and Dr.\r\nDaniel H. Burtnett. Each of the parties was held to bail in the sum of\r\n$3,000, to appear for examination.\r\n\r\nThe movement must have been of considerable magnitude, but there was\r\nevidently a want of concert among its members, which may have led to\r\nits abandonment. From what could be ascertained, it was not the\r\nintention of the leaders to organize the expedition in this country,\r\nbut to sail to some point beyond the limits of the United States, and\r\nthere concentrate their forces for the invasion.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina State Rights Convention assembled at Charleston on\r\nthe 5th of May. The Hon. J. P. Richardson, Ex-Governor of the State,\r\nwas appointed President. Forty district associations were represented,\r\nand 431 Delegates took their seats. The President, in his opening\r\naddress, reviewed the present position of the South, and considered\r\nthat, under existing circumstances, Southern institutions could not\r\nexist twenty years. He discussed at some length the want of affinity\r\nbetween the two sections of the Union, and expressed his conviction\r\nthat those whom God and Nature have put asunder should not be joined\r\ntogether. On the second day, a letter from the Hon. Langdon Cheves was\r\nread, excusing his non-attendance. He deprecated separate State\r\naction, believing that one State cannot stand alone in the midst of\r\nher sister States.\r\n\r\nA committee of twenty-one was appointed to prepare resolutions and an\r\naddress, which were adopted, after considerable discussion. The\r\nfollowing are the resolutions, which embody the sentiments of the\r\nConvention:\r\n\r\n1. _Resolved_, That in the opinion of this meeting the State of South\r\nCarolina cannot submit to the wrongs and aggressions which have been\r\nperpetrated by the Federal Government and the Northern States, without\r\ndishonor and ruin; and that it is necessary for her to relieve herself\r\ntherefrom, whether with or without the co-operation of other Southern\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n2. _Resolved_, That concert of action with one or more of our sister\r\nStates of the South, whether through the proposed Southern Congress,\r\nor in any other manner, is an object worth many sacrifices, but not\r\nthe sacrifice involved in submission.\r\n\r\n3. _Resolved_, That we hold the right of secession to be essential to\r\nthe sovereignty and freedom of the States of this confederacy; and\r\nthat the denial of that right would furnish to an injured State the\r\nstrongest additional cause for its exercise.\r\n\r\n4. _Resolved_, That this meeting looks with confidence and hope to the\r\nConvention of the People, to exert the sovereign power of the State in\r\ndefence of its rights, at the earliest practicable period and in the\r\nmost effectual manner, and to the Legislature, to adopt the most\r\nspeedy and effectual measures toward the same end.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnwell and two other members of the Committee presented a\r\nminority Report, referring the whole matter to the action of the\r\nLegislature. Judge Butler, U. S. Senator, also recommended a\r\npostponement of any decisive step. The original Report, however, was\r\nadopted, and the Convention adjourned _sine die_. The subject has\r\noccasioned but little excitement out of South Carolina, and it is not\r\nanticipated that any other State will pursue a similar course.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican Government has made a formal complaint to the President of\r\nthe United States, in relation to the Indian outrages along the\r\nfrontier, which the United States were bound to suppress, according to\r\nthe Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo. It is believed that a demand of a\r\nmillion of dollars will be made for damages which the Indians have\r\nalready caused; besides which, Mexico refuses to ratify the\r\nTchuantepec Treaty, unless these provisions are fulfilled. At the last\r\nsession of Congress, the appropriation asked by the War Department for\r\nthis purpose, was not made; besides which, the troops most serviceable\r\nfor such a warfare have been disbanded.\r\n\r\nAn order has been issued by the President, that the tracts of land in\r\nIowa, occupied by General Ujhazy and the other Hungarian exiles, shall\r\nbe withheld from sale until the end of the next session of Congress,\r\nwith a view to making application to that body for a grant of the\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Legislature, after a struggle of four months,\r\nsucceeded in electing a U. S. Senator on the 24th of April. Charles\r\nSumner, Esq., the Free Soil Candidate, was chosen on that day, by 193\r\nvotes, precisely the number necessary for election. The Boston Board\r\nof Aldermen, who had passed a resolution refusing the use of Faneuil\r\nHall for a public address by Daniel Webster, have since then retracted\r\nthe step and concurred with the Common Council in inviting Mr. Webster\r\nto address the citizens of Boston. Faneuil Hall, hereafter, is to be\r\ngranted on all occasions, at the application of one hundred voters.\r\nBefore leaving Boston, Mr. Webster delivered a speech to the citizens\r\nof Boston, from the steps of the Revere House.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of New-York adjourned on the 17th of April. The\r\nquestion of the enlargement of the Erie Canal was before the Senate,\r\nwhen twelve of the Democratic members of that body resigned their\r\nseats in order to prevent the passage of the bill, by leaving the\r\nsenate without a quorum. The usual annual appropriations had not been\r\nvoted, and the Government was thus placed without the means of\r\nsustaining its operations. An extra session of the Legislature has\r\nbeen called by Governor Hunt, for the 10th of June. Elections have\r\nbeen ordered, in the mean time, to fill the vacancies caused by the\r\nresignation of the Senators. The Members of the Assembly, of both\r\nparties, published manifestoes in relation to the question.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic Coast and the Lakes have been visited this spring with a\r\nsuccession of tremendous gales, which have done an immense amount of\r\ndamage in various quarters. A storm arose along the Northeastern\r\ncoast, on the 15th of April, and at noon on the following day the tide\r\nwas higher at Boston than had ever been known before. On the principal\r\nwharves of the city the water was three or four feet deep, and the\r\nstreets were so flooded that a large boat could be rowed around the\r\nCustom House. An immense amount of damage was done to private\r\nproperty, and many lives were lost. The railroad tracks all around the\r\ncity were submerged, and in many places torn up and washed away. All\r\nalong the coast, from New Bedford to Portland, the gale raged with\r\nnearly equal violence, causing much injury to the shipping. The loss\r\nof property is estimated at more than one million of dollars.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 17th of April, the third day of the storm, the\r\nlight-house on Minot's Ledge, at the entrance of Boston harbor, was\r\ncarried away, and the two men in it at the time drowned. Mr. Bennett,\r\nthe keeper, who had been to Boston, was prevented from returning to it\r\nby the rough sea, and thus escaped. It was formed of wrought iron\r\nbars, riveted into the rock, and rising to the height of sixty feet,\r\nhaving chambers in the upper part for the keeper and his assistants.\r\nThe light-house had been severely tested in the late equinoctial\r\nstorm, and was considered secure.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency, President Fillmore, accompanied by the Hon. Daniel\r\nWebster, Secretary of State; Hon. William A. Graham, Secretary of the\r\nNavy; Hon. J. J. Crittenden, Attorney General; and Hon. N. K. Hall,\r\nPostmaster General, left Washington on the 12th of May, in order to be\r\npresent at the opening of the Erie Railroad from New-York to Dunkirk.\r\nThey were received with great enthusiasm on the way; at Baltimore and\r\nWilmington they were officially welcomed, and were met at the latter\r\nplace by the Mayor and Common Council of Philadelphia, who escorted\r\nthem to that city.\r\n\r\nHere the people turned out to give them a public reception, and\r\nspeeches were made by the President and Mr. Webster. On their way to\r\nNew-York they were met at Amboy by the Erie Railroad Company's steamer\r\nand conveyed to the city, saluted on the way by national salutes from\r\nthe forts in the harbor, and the military companies of the city, who\r\nwere drawn up on the Battery, to receive the distinguished visitors.\r\nThe ceremonies of welcome were performed in Castle Garden, where the\r\nPresident and Secretaries were welcomed by Mayor Kingsland. Eloquent\r\nspeeches were made in return by the President, Mr. Webster, and Mr.\r\nCrittenden. A military procession more than a mile in length, was then\r\nformed, and marched through the principal streets, which were thronged\r\nwith spectators. Flags were waving from every point, and as the day\r\nwas remarkably bright and warm, the spectacle was one of unusual life\r\nand animation.\r\n\r\nThe Company's boat left New-York at 6 o'clock on the morning of the\r\n14th, having on board the President and Secretaries, all the principal\r\nState officers except Governor Hunt, the officers of the Erie Railroad\r\nCompany, a large representation from the State Senate and Assembly,\r\nand both boards of the Common Council of the city, besides a number of\r\nother distinguished persons. At Piermont, three special trains\r\nreceived the company, 600 in all, and the grand march of 450 miles,\r\nthrough what was lately the wilderness of the State, from the Hudson\r\nto Lake Erie, commenced. All along the line of the road the people\r\nturned out _en masse_, cannons were fired and bells rung as the trains\r\npassed, and triumphal arches erected over the road. Brief addresses\r\nwere made at the principal stations by the President, Mr. Webster, Mr.\r\nSeward, Mr. Crittenden, and other distinguished guests. The trains\r\nstopped at Elmira for the night, and proceeded next day to Dunkirk,\r\nwhich they reached in the afternoon. Here the crowning celebration was\r\nmade. All the country, far and near, arose to hail the completion of\r\nthe greatest railroad enterprise in the world. After the meeting, a\r\ngrand barbecue was held: two oxen and ten sheep were roasted whole,\r\nand the company regaled on a magnificent scale. The day following this\r\nopening excursion, the regular passenger trains commenced running from\r\nNew-York to Dunkirk. The distance between the Ocean and Lake Erie is\r\nnow but a summer's day.\r\n\r\nIn the Connecticut Legislature the Democratic candidate for Governor,\r\nMr. Seymour, was elected by a majority of one vote. The Legislature of\r\nRhode Island, on the 10th of May, restored to Ex-Gov. Dorr,\r\n(well-known as the leader of \"Dorr's Rebellion,\") all the rights and\r\nprivileges of a citizen.\r\n\r\nM. Bois Le Compte, the French Minister at Washington, who has been\r\nrecalled by his Government, took leave of the President on the 2d of\r\nMay, and will shortly return to France.\r\n\r\nJenny Lind reached New-York in the beginning of May, after a\r\ntriumphant tour of five months in the South and West. She commenced a\r\nseries of farewell concerts on the 7th. She was received with as full\r\na house and scarcely less enthusiasm than on the night of her first\r\nappearance in America. The Firemen of the city, in return for her\r\ndonation of $3000 to the Widows' and Orphans' Fund, have presented her\r\nwith a resolution of thanks inclosed in a gold box, and a copy of\r\nAudubon's Birds of America in a rosewood case.\r\n\r\nA fire occurred at Santa Fe, New Mexico, on the 22d of April, which\r\ndestroyed the finest hotel in the place. Col. Sumner, who is to take\r\ncommand of the United States military force in the Department, carries\r\nwith him a large amount of seeds, grains, improved stock, farming\r\nutensils, and apparatus for developing the capacity of the soil. It is\r\ndesigned to make the United States troops in New Mexico support\r\nthemselves as far as possible. The Apache Indians have been very\r\ntroublesome, but a treaty of amity has been effected with their\r\nprincipal chief, Chacon. The Mexican citizens are well satisfied with\r\nthe establishment of the Territorial Government.\r\n\r\nThe California mails of March 15th and April 1st have been received.\r\nThe steamers which sailed from San Francisco on those days took away\r\nmore than $3,500,000 in gold dust for the Atlantic States. The news is\r\ngenerally of a very favorable character. The severe drought which had\r\nprevailed through the whole winter, terminated on the 17th of March,\r\nwhen a succession of heavy showers commenced, the effect of which had\r\nbeen to revive business of all kinds. The miners in the dry diggings\r\nhad a sufficiency of water to wash out their piles of dirt, and the\r\ngold dust, flowing into the centres of trades, soon dissipated the\r\ndulness which had fallen upon business of all kinds. Agricultural\r\nprospects have also brightened, and the crops of California will this\r\nyear be an important feature of her products. The odious tax of $20\r\nper month on all foreign miners has been repealed, and the Mexicans\r\nand Chilians who were last year driven out of the country will\r\nprobably return.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature still continues in session, and since its futile\r\nattempt to elect a United States Senator, has gone vigorously to work.\r\nThe sale of lottery tickets has been prohibited; the sum of $200,000\r\nappropriated for the pay of persons engaged in military operations\r\nagainst the Indians, and the State Treasurer authorized to obtain a\r\nloan of $500,000. The District Court of Sacramento has given a\r\ndecision sustaining the suitors of claims on all lands on which the\r\ncity is located. A fugitive slave case--the first in California--has\r\nbeen settled at San Francisco. The owner of a slave, who had employed\r\nhim in the mines for three or four months, was about to return with\r\nhim to the Atlantic States. But as the slave preferred remaining, a\r\nwrit of habeas corpus was procured and a hearing had before the Court,\r\nwhich decided that the negro was at liberty to stay and could not be\r\nremoved against his will.\r\n\r\nA fire broke out in a bowling alley in Nevada City, on the 12th of\r\nMarch, and spread so rapidly that before it could be subdued, the\r\nlargest and best portion of the city was in ashes. One hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight houses were destroyed, and the entire loss is estimated\r\nat $300,000.\r\n\r\nAccounts from all parts of the gold region give flattering accounts of\r\nthe golden harvest for the present year. The richest locality appears\r\nto be the district lying between Feather River and the American Fork,\r\nembracing the Yuba and its tributaries. The northern mines, on\r\nTrinity, Scott's and Klamath Rivers, continue to attract attention. On\r\nthe Mokelumne River, gold is found in large quantities on the sides\r\nand summits of the hills. A placer of the precious metal has also been\r\ndiscovered by the Mexicans near San Diego. The operations in quartz\r\nmining promise to be very profitable. A vein near Nevada City has been\r\nsold for $130,000. Later accounts from the Gold Bluff are more\r\nencouraging. The top sand was washed away during a severe gale, and\r\nthe heavy substratum, being washed, was found to yield from three to\r\neight ounces to each pailful. Messrs. Moffat & Co., who obtained the\r\nGovernment contract for assaying gold, received deposits of gold dust\r\namounting to $100,000 in two hours after opening their office. The\r\noperations of the office had such an effect that the bankers of San\r\nFrancisco were compelled to raise the price of gold dust to $17 per\r\nounce, in order to have any share in the trade.\r\n\r\nProfessor Forest Shepard, of New-Haven, who has been prosecuting\r\ngeological explorations in different parts of California, has\r\ndiscovered a remarkable valley in the Coast Range, north of Napa\r\nValley. It is an immense chasm, 1000 feet deep, in the bottom of which\r\nwas a large number of boiling springs and jets of steam, with here and\r\nthere a fountain of hot water, similar to the geysers of Iceland.\r\nThere are more than two hundred in all, within a compass of half a\r\nmile square. The soil of the valley was so warm that, although it was\r\nin the middle of winter, flowers were in full bloom and a luxuriant\r\nvegetation springing on all sides. It is Professor Shepard's intention\r\nto claim a portion of the valley, build a house thereon, and plant\r\ntropical trees in the warm soil.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Samuel R. Thurston, Delegate to Congress from Oregon\r\nTerritory, died on the 9th ult., on board the steamer California,\r\nbound from Panama to San Francisco. His remains were taken to Acapulco\r\nfor interment.\r\n\r\nOur news from Oregon is to the 22d of March. A discovery has been made\r\nby Capt. George Drew, of a vein of coal on the Cowlitz River, eighteen\r\nmiles from its junction with the Columbia, and about one mile from the\r\nmain Cowlitz. The vein is two feet thick and about half a mile in\r\nwidth, fifteen feet above high water mark and about forty feet below\r\nthe surface of the bluff mountain. Governor Ogden, of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany, at Vancouver, sent a boat and crew to bring a quantity away,\r\nthat it may be fairly tested.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPE.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations, in the Crystal\r\nPalace at LONDON, was opened on Thursday, May 1, with appropriate and\r\nimposing ceremonies. Just before twelve o'clock, which was the hour\r\nappointed for the arrival of the Queen, the rain that had been falling\r\nat intervals during the day ceased altogether, and the sun shone forth\r\nfrom a cloudless sky. On the appearance of the Royal cortege, the\r\nutmost enthusiasm was manifested by the people who thronged the\r\nvicinity of the Palace, and, in the midst of the cheers of the\r\nmultitude, and the flourish of military music, the Queen, accompanied\r\nby Prince Albert, the Prince of Wales, and the Princess Royal, was\r\nushered into the interior of the building. She was welcomed by the\r\nvast assemblage with repeated and universal cheers, ladies waved their\r\nhandkerchiefs, gentlemen their hats, and the whole scene presented a\r\nspectacle of unrivalled splendor. After she had ascended the throne,\r\nwhich was a raised platform surmounted with a blue canopy ornamented\r\nwith feathers, the National Anthem was sung by an immense choir under\r\ndirection of Sir Henry Bishop. When the music had ceased, Prince\r\nAlbert presented to the Queen the report of the proceedings of the\r\nCommissioners, to which she replied in a short speech. The Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury then offered the prayer of inauguration, at the close of\r\nwhich the Hallelujah Chorus was sung. A procession was now formed,\r\ncomposed of the architect, contractors, and officials engaged in the\r\nconstruction of the Crystal Palace, the Foreign Commissioners, the\r\nRoyal Commissioners, Foreign Ambassadors, and the members of the Royal\r\nFamily. After making the circuit of the building in the procession,\r\nthe Queen resumed her seat on the platform, and announced by a herald\r\nthat the Exhibition was opened. A flourish of trumpets and a discharge\r\nof artillery proclaimed the fact to the thronging multitudes on the\r\noutside. The Queen, attended by the Court, then withdrew from the\r\nbuilding; the choir again struck up the strain of the National Anthem;\r\nthe barriers, which had confined the spectators within certain limits,\r\nwere removed; and the whole mass of visitors poured over every part of\r\nthe magnificent edifice, eager to gratify a highly excited curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe number of exhibitors, whose productions are now displayed in the\r\nCrystal Palace, is about 15,000. One-half of these are British\r\nsubjects. The remainder represent the industry of more than forty\r\nother nations, comprising nearly every civilized country on the globe.\r\nThe Exhibition is divided into four classes; 1. Raw Materials; 2.\r\nMachinery; 3. Manufactures; 4. Sculpture and the Fine Arts. A further\r\ndivision is made, according to the geographical position of the\r\ncountries represented, those which lie within the warmer latitudes\r\nbeing placed near the centre of the building, and the colder countries\r\nat the extremities. The Crystal Palace, which was commenced on the\r\n26th of September, and has accordingly been completed in the short\r\nspace of seven months, occupies an extent of about 18 acres, measuring\r\n1,851 feet in length, and 556 in breadth, and affords a frontage for\r\nthe exhibition of goods amounting in the aggregate to over 10 miles.\r\nIt can accommodate at one time 40,000 visitors.\r\n\r\nAn interesting debate took place in the BRITISH House of Commons on\r\nthe 3d of April, upon a motion by Mr. Herries for the repeal of the\r\nIncome Tax. In an elaborate speech supporting his motion, Mr. Herries\r\nmaintained that the Income Tax was proposed by Sir Robert Peel in\r\norder to meet a peculiar emergency occasioned by the maladministration\r\nof the Whigs prior to 1841. He presented a minute calculation for the\r\npurpose of showing that two-sevenths of the tax might be remitted\r\nwithout damage to the financial interests of the nation, and that the\r\nremission of L1,560,000 would be a greater relief than the removal of\r\nthe window-tax. In reply to Mr. Herries, the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer contended that the measures contemplated in the motion were\r\nof the most disastrous tendency, and recommended the House to vote an\r\nIncome Tax for three years. On a division of the House, Mr. Herries'\r\nmotion was lost by a majority of 48.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Colonial Expenditures has elicited a warm debate in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Sir William Molesworth argued in favor of giving the\r\nmeans of local self-government to all colonies which are not military\r\nstations nor convict settlements. The colonies cost the United Kingdom\r\nthe enormous sum of L4,000,000 sterling. He believed the military\r\nforce maintained in the various colonies might be cut down to less\r\nthan half the present establishment without injury to the Government.\r\nUnder proper regulations, 17,000 men would be sufficient for the\r\ncolonial garrisons, instead of 45,000. For colonial services the\r\ntroops should be paid by the colonies--for Imperial purposes, by the\r\nGeneral Government. He contended that in the North American colonies,\r\nthe expenditure for military affairs should be reduced L400,000 per\r\nannum, and in the West Indies L250,000. From the Australian colonies\r\nnearly the whole military force might be withdrawn to advantage.\r\nUnless the military operations were discontinued in South Africa, the\r\nwar would cost L1,000,000 more than the value of the colony. In\r\nconclusion, he estimated that the adoption of his measures would save\r\nthe Government at least L1,800,000 in military and civil expenditure.\r\nThe views of Sir William Molesworth were ably sustained by other\r\nmembers, while, on the contrary, Lord John Russell declared they were\r\nof a ruinous tendency, and earnestly protested against their adoption.\r\nIf the plan were carried into effect, the glory of the British nation\r\nwould be destroyed. She could no longer maintain her proud position\r\nbefore the world. The integrity of her empire would be annihilated,\r\nand she would be exposed to the attack of foreign powers. The debate\r\nwas finally adjourned without a division.\r\n\r\nThe latest intelligence concerning Miss Talbot, whose relation to the\r\nRoman Catholic controversy has produced such a general excitement in\r\nEngland, is her decision to accept of a proposal of marriage from Lord\r\nEdward Howard, a Catholic nobleman of wealth and character.\r\nApplication was made by the friends of the parties for the consent of\r\nthe Lord Chancellor, which was given without hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe British Government has presented a memorial to the Courts of\r\nBerlin and Vienna, on the subject of admitting non-German territories\r\ninto the Confederation, and insisting on a strict adherence to the\r\nTreaty of Vienna.\r\n\r\nA new cabinet has been formed in FRANCE, consisting of Baroche,\r\nRouher, Fould, Leon-Faucher, Buffet, Chasseloup Laubat, de\r\nCrouseilhes, Randon and Maque. The most prominent of these ministers\r\nare Baroche, Fould, and Leon-Faucher. They are all taken from the\r\nminority of the Assembly, and their choice will increase the\r\ndifference between the President and that body. Baroche and Fould were\r\nmembers of the ministry which was obliged to retire in January last,\r\nbefore the opposition of the Assembly. Leon-Faucher labors under the\r\nstigma of having used the telegraph for electioneering purposes, for\r\nwhich he was condemned by the vote of the constituent assembly. Buffet\r\nwas minister of commerce and agriculture in the administration of\r\nO'Dillon-Barrot. He is inclined to free trade sentiments, agreeing for\r\nthe most part with Leon-Faucher in his commercial views. De\r\nCrouseilhes is a legitimist. He is an ex-peer of France, but has been\r\nmore distinguished for his private worth than his political ability.\r\nChasseloup Laubat has been in official employment since 1828, though\r\nhe is still under fifty years of age. The best debater in the new\r\nministry is undoubtedly Baroche, whose sagacity and mental vigor\r\ncannot be mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe political condition of France is still the subject of much\r\nspeculation, but no definite conclusions can be arrived at in the\r\npresent fluctuations of parties. Every thing shows the uncertainty\r\nwhich pervades the public mind. The President has renounced the hope\r\nof improving his political prospects, by obtaining a revision of the\r\nconstitution. This could not be carried without a majority of\r\nthree-fourths of the Assembly, while at least nearly 190 of the most\r\nstrenuous republicans are decidedly opposed to the measure. The\r\ngovernment is now sustained by the legitimists, who perceive no\r\nimmediate hope of the accomplishment of their favorite plans. The\r\npartisans of Cavaignac are in favor of the speedy resignation of the\r\nPresident. In their opinion, this is necessary, in order to anticipate\r\nthe general election, and thus prevent the difficulties that would\r\nensue by the dissolution of the Assembly, without an established\r\nexecutive. Others, on the contrary, are in favor of extending the\r\nPresidential term for the period of ten years. A reconciliation was\r\nabout to take place, according to the general rumor, between the\r\nPresident and General Changarnier. The government has demanded of the\r\ncabinet at London the expulsion of Ledru Rollin and other active\r\npoliticians among the French refugees. With the present facilities of\r\ncommunication between London and Paris, their influence was believed\r\nto be adverse to the policy of the French government, and to increase\r\nthe difficulties of the existing crisis.\r\n\r\nAn insurrection, headed by the Duke of Saldanha, has been attempted in\r\nCientra, PORTUGAL. The insurgents were about five thousand in number,\r\nand displayed considerable determination. Their leader is a man of\r\ngreat energy, and has had no small experience in political\r\ndisturbances. He belongs to the reactionary party. The King, who\r\ncommands the army in person, has occupied the fortress of Santarem,\r\nand the chances of the insurgents appear desperate, although they are\r\nsaid to have some friends in the royal army. The garrison at Oporto\r\nhave declared for Saldanha, and the inhabitants of that city are\r\ngenerally on his side. He had decided to abandon the contest, and\r\nembark for England, but was recalled by the insurgents.\r\n\r\nThe King of NAPLES has prohibited his subjects from taking part in the\r\nExhibition of the World's Fair, and from being present at it as\r\nvisitors. The King of Sardinia proposes to visit England during the\r\nExhibition.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of RUSSIA has appointed a Committee of manufacturers and\r\nscientific men, under the Presidency of the Director General of Public\r\nWorks to visit the Exhibition, and also to examine the principal\r\nmanufacturing establishments of France. He has also given permission\r\nto his subjects who may attend the exhibition, to pass through France\r\non complying with certain conditions.\r\n\r\nThe city of DRONTHEIM has again suffered from a popular outbreak,\r\nalthough not from political causes. The military and burgher guard\r\nwere compelled to interfere, and several arrests took place. The\r\ndifficulty originated in the prohibition of the sale of fish by the\r\npeasantry, in compliance with the demands of the licensed fishermen.\r\n\r\nA misunderstanding of a serious nature has occurred between the\r\nEmperor of AUSTRIA and the Sultan of TURKEY. This has resulted in the\r\nwithdrawal of the Austrian minister from Constantinople. The Sultan is\r\ncharged with refusing to comply with the demands of the Emperor in\r\nregard to Kossuth and the other Hungarian prisoners. He declines\r\ndetaining them after the expiration of the year during which he had\r\npromised to hold them in custody. An additional offence is his\r\npresentation of a claim upon the Austrian treasury for the expenses of\r\nthe detention.\r\n\r\nAt our last dates from TURKEY, the Bosnian insurrection had been\r\nconducted with great activity, although it has probably been\r\nsuppressed by Omer Pasha. A sanguinary engagement between the Sultan's\r\ntroops and a body of fifteen thousand insurgents has taken place in\r\nthe vicinity of Jaicza, in which several hundred of the combatants on\r\nboth sides were killed or mortally wounded. The conflict terminated in\r\nfavor of the rebels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recent Deaths._\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN J. D. CUNNINGHAM, of the Bengal Engineers, author of the\r\n_History of the Sikhs_, died in India on the twenty-eight of February,\r\nin consequence, it is said, of his removal from the political agency\r\nof Bhopaul, where his services and abilities had been highly valued.\r\nThe act of the \"Company\" fell with peculiar hardship upon an officer\r\nwho had passed twenty years of honorable and uninterrupted service in\r\nevery climate of India, and whose error (if any were committed by the\r\npublication in question) was certainly not of a character demanding\r\ncensure so grave. It will be recollected that the book threw some new\r\nlight on the conduct of Lord Hardinge at Sobraon, and that the writer\r\nwas dismissed on the charge of having, \"without authority,\" published\r\ndocuments officially intrusted to his charge. The friends of Captain\r\nCunningham aver that he had formerly asked permission, and he\r\nconstrued the reply to be an expression of indifference on the part of\r\nthe directors. It was never pretended that an unworthy motive had\r\ninfluenced him, or that he had acted on any other than a desire\r\n(however mistaken) to promote the welfare of the government to which\r\nhe was attached. It is understood that Captain Cunningham's health\r\nbroke soon after this painful misunderstanding, and that its effects\r\npursued him to his death. He was a son of Allan Cunningham, had\r\ndistinguished himself greatly in all his Indian employments, and had\r\nnot completed his fortieth year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Glasgow Citizen_ calls attention to the death of Mr. JOHN\r\nHENNING, the well-known Paisley artist, whose studies from the Elgin\r\nmarbles and cartoons after Raphad obtained so much distinction for\r\nhimself, and contributed so largely to the diffusion of a general\r\ntaste for the fine arts amongst his countrymen. Mr. Henning was a\r\nself-taught sculptor, and devoted twelve years of his life, under\r\ngreat difficulties, to the restoration of the Greek marbles brought\r\nover by Lord Elgin. His copies of these on a reduced scale are so well\r\nknown and esteemed as to render eulogium on their merits here\r\nunnecessary. Many busts of his contemporaries remain to testify\r\nfurther to the excellence of his hand. He was one of the men whom his\r\nnative town \"delighted to honor.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPADRE ROZAVEN, one of the most famous of modern Jesuits, and\r\ndistinguished by divers polemical treatises, as well as by a long\r\nresidence and religious warfare in Russia, has just died in Rome in\r\nhis eighty-second year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRINCE WITTGENSTEIN, Minister of the Royal House of Prussia, died on\r\nthe 11th April, at Berlin, at the age of eighty-one. He had been in\r\nthe service of the state fifty-six years, and had filled the post in\r\nwhich he died since 1819.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHENRY BICKERSTETH, LORD LANGDALE, late Master of the Rolls, died on\r\nGood Friday, at Tunbridge Wells, to which place he had lately repaired\r\nfor the benefit of his health--impaired by long-continued mental\r\nlabor, resulting in a paralytic stroke, which took place shortly\r\nbefore his death. He was born on the eighteenth of June, 1783, in the\r\ncounty of Westmoreland, where his father was possessed of a small\r\nproperty. Originally destined for the medical profession (of which his\r\nfather was a member), in which he had completed his studies, he\r\nvisited the Continent with the family of the late Earl of Oxford, by\r\nwhose advice he was induced to embark on the career of the bar. He\r\nentered Caius College, Cambridge, where he took his degrees as senior\r\nwrangler in 1808. Three years afterwards he was called to the bar, and\r\nengaged at once in the duties of his profession. He rapidly rose to\r\ngreat eminence in the Equity Courts, to which he confined his\r\npractice. On the nineteenth of January, 1836, he was appointed to\r\nsucceed Lord Cottenham as Master of the Rolls, and was at the same\r\ntime called to the House of Peers. But a few months had elapsed after\r\nhis accession to the mastership of the rolls when Lord Langdale\r\ndelivered in the House of Lords his remarkable speech on the\r\nadministration of justice in the Court of Chancery, and on the\r\nappellate jurisdiction of their lordships' house, and to the opinions\r\nexpressed in that speech, and in favor of the division of the duties\r\nof the Great Seal, he constantly adhered. On the resignation of Lord\r\nCottenham last year, the Great Seal was more than once tendered to\r\nLord Langdale by the head of the present administration; but though he\r\nconsented to act as first commissioner, and sat for a short time in\r\nthe Lord Chancellor's court, and in the House of Lords, in that\r\ncapacity, the intense application to which the state of the Court of\r\nChancery had condemned him forbade a further stretch of his powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERAL E. J. ROBERTS, for many years conspicuous as an editor and a\r\npolitician in the state of New York, died at the age of fifty-five, a\r\nfew weeks ago, at Detroit. He formerly edited _The Craftsman_, at\r\nRochester, and in 1830 was editor of a journal of that title in\r\nAlbany. He removed to Michigan in 1834, and filled very important\r\noffices in that state. He was a member of the state senate at the time\r\nof his death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Stockholm is announced the death, at the age of seventy-one, of\r\nthe distinguished botanist and geologist, M.

Wahlenberg is stated to have spent\r\nthirty out of his seventy-one years in scientific journies through the\r\ndifferent countries of Europe; and the results of these travels he has\r\nrecorded in a variety of learned works. He left his rich collection\r\nand numerous library to the University of Upsal; in which he was a\r\nstudent,--and to which he was attached in various capacities during\r\nupwards of forty-three years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe lack room for notices of the lives of Archbishop ECLESTON, of\r\nBaltimore; General BRADY, of the United States Army; and Mr. PHILIP\r\nHONE, three eminent persons who have died since our last publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE. E. MARCY, M.D., AUTHOR OF THE \"HOMOEOPATHIC THEORY AND PRACTICE.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Marcy is one of the thousand or more physicians of the old school\r\nwho have become homoeopathists. With professional eminence, and a\r\nliberal fortune, he joined the converts to the doctrine of Hahnemann,\r\nand at once took rank among the most distinguished physicians of the\r\nnew practice. Homoeopathy is one of the grand facts of this age. It\r\nis no longer laughed at, but has reached that condition which enables\r\nit to challenge a respectful consideration from all who would not\r\nthemselves be subjects of ridicule. Of educated and thoughtful men, in\r\nour large cities, it is contended that more than one-half are of its\r\nsupporters. In Great Britain we see that Archbishop Whately, the\r\nChevalier Bunsen, and Dr. Scott of Owen's College, constitute a trio\r\nof its literary adherents. Cobden, Leslie, and Wilson, are examples of\r\nits parliamentary partizans. Radetzky, Pulzsky, and General\r\nFarquharson, rank among its numerous military defenders. Leaf, Sugden,\r\nand Forbes, are three of its great London merchants. The Duke of\r\nHamilton, the Earls of Wilton, Shrewsbury, Erne, and Denbigh, and\r\nLords Robert Grosvenor, Newport, and Kinnaird, may serve for its guard\r\nof honor. Queen Adelaide was one of its numerous royal and noble\r\npatients, and the Duchess of Kent is the patroness of a great fair to\r\nbe held for the benefit of some of its institutions in London during\r\nthis present month of June--in the very heyday of the exhibition\r\nseason. In France, Guizot, Changarnier, Comte, Lamartine, and some\r\nforty members of the Academy, are among its advocates. Here in\r\nNew-York, it is sufficient to say of the character of the society in\r\nwhich it is received, that it includes Bryant, who has been among the\r\nmost active of its lay teachers.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that homoeopathy not only spreads apace, but that it\r\nalso spreads in all sorts of good directions, through the present\r\nfabric of society. And this fact certainly conveys the idea that there\r\nmust be some sort of truth in homoeopathy; whether pure or mixed,\r\nwhether negative or affirmative, whether critical of something old, or\r\ndeclaratory of something new.\r\n\r\nDr. Marcy is one of the leaders of the sect. He is the son of an\r\neminent lawyer, who for more than twenty years has been in the\r\nlegislature of Massachusetts; he was graduated at Amherst College,\r\ntook his degree of Doctor in Medicine at the University of\r\nPennsylvania, and for ten years devoted himself with great success to\r\nmedicine and surgery in Hartford: in surgery, on several occasions,\r\ncommanding the applause of both European and American academies. As a\r\nchemist, also, he greatly distinguished himself; and it is not too\r\nmuch to say, that in the application of chemistry to the arts, he has\r\nbeen more fortunate than any other American. At length, while\r\ntravelling in Europe, he became a convert to the theory, _similia\r\nsimilibus curantur_, and renouncing his earlier notions, gave himself\r\nup to the study of it. He published, six months ago, in a volume of\r\nsix hundred pages, _The Homoeopathic Theory and Practice of\r\nMedicine_, of which a second edition is now in press; and he is\r\nindustriously occupied, when not attending to the general business of\r\nhis profession, with a voluminous work on _Animal Chemistry_.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted by the most wise and profoundly learned physicians of\r\nthe allopathic practice, that the laws of that practice are for the\r\nmost part vague and uncertain. The cumulative experiences of many ages\r\nhave shown indeed that certain substances have certain effects in\r\ncertain conditions of the human organism; but the processes by which\r\nthese effects are induced are unknown, or not so established as justly\r\nto be regarded as a part of science. Facts have been observed, and\r\nhypotheses have been formed, but there has been no demonstrative\r\ngeneralization, really no philosophy of disease and cure; and while in\r\nalmost every other department, investigation and reflection have led\r\nby a steady and sure advance to the establishment of positive and\r\nimmutable principles, medicine has made, except in a few specialities,\r\nno advance at all, unless the theory here disclosed shall prove a\r\nsolution of its secrets. Of these specialities, the most important has\r\nbeen the discovery of the homoeopathic law in the isolated case of\r\nsmallpox. Every body knows how difficult and slow was the reception of\r\nthe principle of inoculation--of _similia similibus curantur_--in this\r\ndisease; but it was received at last universally; and then arose\r\nHahnemann, to claim for every disorder of the human system the\r\napplication of the same principle. Right or wrong, the father of\r\nhomoeopathy gave us a system, perfect in its parts, universal in its\r\nfitness, and eminently beautiful in its simplicity. It has been half a\r\ncentury before the world, and though all the universities have\r\nparleyed and made truce with other innovations and asserted heresies,\r\nand opened against this their heaviest and best plied artillery, it is\r\nnot to be denied that homoeopathy has made more rapid, diffusive,\r\nand pervading advances, than were ever before made by any doctrine of\r\nequal importance, either in morals or physics.\r\n\r\nWe cannot but admit that we have been accustomed to regard the\r\ntheories of Hahnemann with distrust, and that the principle of the\r\nattenuation of drugs, etc., viewed as it was by us through the media\r\nof prejudiced and satirical opposition, seemed to be trivial and\r\nabsurd. We heard frequently of remarkable cures by Hahnemann's\r\ndisciples, and even witnessed the benefits of their treatment, but so\r\nperfectly had the sharp ridicule of the allopathists warped our\r\njudgment and moulded our feelings, that we felt a sort of humiliation\r\nin confessing an advantage from an \"infinitesimal dose.\" We could\r\nnever forget the keen and brilliant wit with which our friend Holmes,\r\nfor example, assailed a system which threatened to take away his\r\npractice and patients, deprive him of his income, and consign his\r\nprofessional erudition and ingenious speculation to oblivion. But the\r\nwork of Dr. Marcy displayed these matters to us in an entirely\r\ndifferent light, and guarded by walls of truths and arguments quite\r\nimpenetrable by the most finely pointed or most powerful satire. His\r\nwell-known abilities, great learning, and long successful experience\r\nas an allopathist, gave us assurance that his conversion to the school\r\nof Hahnemann could have been induced only by inherent elements of\r\nextraordinary force and vitality in its principles, and we looked to\r\nhim confidently, when we understood that he was preparing for the\r\npress an exhibition and vindication of homoeopathy, for such a work\r\nas should at least screen the layman who accepted its doctrines from\r\nthe reproach of fanatical or credulous weakness. We were not\r\ndisappointed. He has given us a simple and powerful appeal to the\r\ncommon sense upon the whole subject. In language terse, direct, and\r\nperspicuous, and with such bravery as belongs to the consciousness of\r\na championship for truth, he displays every branch of his law, with\r\nits antagonism, and leads his readers captive to an assenting\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nDr. Marcy's work is the first by an American on the Homoeopathic\r\nTheory and Practice of Medicine; it is at least a very able and\r\nattractive piece of philosophical speculation; and to those who are\r\nstill disposed to think with little respect of the Hahnemannic\r\npeculiarities, we specially commend, before they venture another jest\r\nupon the subject, or endure any more needless nausea and torture, or\r\nsacrifice another constitution or life upon the altar of prejudice,\r\nthe reading of his capital chapters on Allopathy, Homoeopathy, and\r\nthe Attenuation of Drugs and Repetition of Doses.\r\n\r\nThe London _Leader_ demands attention to the scholarship of the\r\nhomoeopathic physicians, to their respectability as thinkers and as\r\nmen, and to the character of their writings; and surveying the\r\nextraordinary and steady advances of the homoeopathic sect, urges\r\nthat every thing, which has at any time won for itself a broad footing\r\nin the world, must have been possessed by some spirit of truth. Every\r\nthoughtful person knows that no system stands fast in virtue of the\r\nerrors about it. It is the amount of truth it contains, however little\r\nand overlaid that may be, which enables an institution or a doctrine\r\nto keep its ground. The extent and quality of that ground, taken\r\ntogether with the length of time it is kept, constitute a measure of\r\nthe quantity of truth by which a militant institute is inspired and\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ladies' Fashions for the Season._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Paris and London the chief novelties have been preparations for the\r\nLondon season. Head-dress is particularly rich, by no means lacking\r\nlively colors, and ornamented with gold, silver, and beads. We only\r\nspeak here of fancy head-dress; for diamonds are always very much\r\nadmired for a rare and _recherchee parure_. Never have they been so\r\nwell set as at the present day, both as regards elegance, lightness,\r\nand convenience. Thus, each night a lady may change the disposition of\r\nher brilliants: to-day she may form them into a band, like a diadem;\r\nto-morrow, a row of pins for the body of her dress; another time she\r\ncan place them on a velvet necklace, and so forth.\r\n\r\nFancy head-dresses are made of lace, blond, silk, gold, or silver.\r\nFlowers of all kinds are also worn, and above all foliage of velvet\r\nand satin, deep shaded, enriched with white or gold beads, and gold or\r\nsilver fruit. We have also seen a _coiffure_ of gold blond, forming a\r\nsmall point at the top of the head, and ornamented on each side with a\r\nbranch of green foliage and golden fruit in little flexible bunches.\r\n\r\nBall dresses have nearly all two skirts, which are ornamented with a\r\nprofusion of flounces, trimmed with ribbons or flowers, which follow\r\nthe shade of the first or upper skirt; or they are used to raise it at\r\nthe sides, or on one side only. We have also seen a dress of white net\r\nwith two skirts, the first (the under) trimmed with two net flounces\r\nat the extremity with two gathers through the middle, and satin\r\nribbon. On each of these flounces was a trimming of Brussels\r\napplication lace, with a gather of ribbon at the top, of the same\r\nwidth as those of the extremity. The second skirt was trimmed at the\r\nbottom with two gathers of ribbon, and one lace flounce with a ribbon\r\ngathering at the top; the body was an intermixture of gathered ribbons\r\nand lace flounces.\r\n\r\nCapotes will be more in vogue than bonnets, their style allowing\r\nspangling, for which bonnets are not suited. We have seen capotes of\r\ntaffeta, and ribbon applied like flounces as ornaments to the crown;\r\nthese ribbons are cut into teeth or plain, but with a narrow border of\r\nmuch brighter shade. We have also seen very pretty capotes covered\r\nwith net, made of very lively colored taffeta. The tops of all these\r\nbonnets are widened more than they are high; however, they are drawn\r\nnear the bottom, and are quite closed.\r\n\r\nDresses, it is certain, will be open in front and heart-shaped to the\r\nbottom of the waist. Low square-fronted chemisettes suit this kind of\r\nbodice, with breast-plates of embroidery and lace. At concerts, many\r\ndresses are seen either with flounces or apron-shaped fronts; that is\r\nto say, the front breadth has a much richer pattern, and different\r\nfrom the other breadths of the skirt. This pattern is generally an\r\nimmense bouquet, whose branches entwine to the top, diminishing in\r\nsize; or there are two large columns of stripes, which form undulating\r\nwreaths.\r\n\r\nDresses of white or other ground of taffeta warped will be the fashion\r\nthis spring for walking; however, we must wait for Longchamps, at the\r\nlatter end of April, to decide the question.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration on the following page is a lace cap, trimmed with\r\nflowers without foliage; African velvet dress; body with Spanish\r\nbasks or skirts cut out into teeth, trimmed with a small white lace,\r\nhaving at the top a small gathering of ribbon; the body trimmed with\r\nlace facing, edged with a gathering of ribbon; black velvet ribbon\r\nround the neck, fastened with a diamond buckle; bracelets the same.\r\nBonnet of pink taffeta, very plain; and plain dress of Valencias, with\r\nfestooned teeth. Small felt bonnet, with bunch of ribbons; Nacaret\r\nvelvet dress; trowsers of cambric muslin, with embroideries; gaiters\r\nof black cloth, and mousquetaire pardessus, trimmed with gimp or lace,\r\nput on flat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMantelets will certainly enjoy more than their usual vogue this\r\nseason, and from what we have seen of the new forms, we must own they\r\nare very superior to any that have before appeared; the novelty of the\r\nforms, and the taste displayed in the garnitures even of those\r\nintended for common use, show that the progress of _la mode_ is quite\r\nas great as any other sort of progress in this most progressing age.\r\nFirst, then, for the mantelets in plain walking dress; they are for\r\nthe most part composed of black taffeta; several are embroidered in\r\nsentache, and bordered with deep flounces of taffeta; others are\r\ntrimmed with fringe of a new and very light kind, and a number,\r\nperhaps indeed the majority, are finished with lace.\r\n\r\nThe materials for robes, in plain morning neglige, are silks of a\r\nquiet kind, and some slight woollen materials, as coutil de laine,\r\nbalzerine, striped Valencias; some in very small, others in large\r\nstripes; corded muslins, and jaconet muslins, flowered in a variety of\r\npatterns. We cannot yet say any thing positively respecting plain\r\nwhite muslins for morning dress, but we have reason to believe they\r\nwill not be much adopted.\r\n\r\nTaffeta has resumed all its vogue for robes; it is adopted both for\r\npublic promenade, half dress, and evening robes. Some of the most\r\nelegant mantelets are of white taffeta.",
