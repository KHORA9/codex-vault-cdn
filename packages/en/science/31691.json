There is a good deal of evidence\r\nto show that in Paleolithic and Neolithic times, cattle were part of the\r\npossessions of the nomadic races; and, according to the Vedas, the\r\nmanufacture of butter was known in India 1500 years B.C.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part of Europe, milk has always been looked upon as one\r\nof the principal kinds of food, but not necessarily the milk of cows,\r\nas, from ancient times to the present day, the milk from camels,\r\nbuffaloes, sheep, and goats has been used indiscriminately throughout\r\nthe East.\r\n\r\nAccording to Layard,[1] \"the Bedouins do not make cheese. The milk of\r\ntheir sheep and goats is shaken into butter or turned into curds; it is\r\nrarely or never drunk fresh, new milk being thought very unwholesome, as\r\nsoon by experience I found it to be, in the desert. I have frequently\r\nhad occasion to describe the process of making butter by shaking the\r\nmilk in skins. This is also an employment confined to women, and one of\r\na very laborious nature. The curds are formed by boiling the milk, and\r\nthen putting some curds made on the previous day into it and allowing it\r\nto stand. When the sheep no longer give milk, some curds are dried, to\r\nbe used as a leaven on a future occasion. This preparation, called\r\n_leben_, is thick and acid, but very agreeable and grateful to the taste\r\nin a hot climate. The sour milk, or _sheneena_, a universal beverage\r\namongst the Arabs, is either buttermilk pure and diluted, or curds mixed\r\nwith water.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE PASS OF BUKOVA.--During the revolution\r\n  of 1904, a number of Turkish soldiers, just before\r\n  traversing this pass, were given coffee containing \"café\"\r\n  by a Bulgarian coffee-seller, or keeper of a small khan.\r\n  Whilst in the pass the poison began to take effect, and\r\n  they realized that they had been poisoned. Fortunately for\r\n  them, a peasant with three horses loaded with Yoghourt\r\n  (soured milk) had taken advantage of their escort. The\r\n  soldiers ate freely of the Yoghourt, which counteracted\r\n  the effects of the poison.]\r\n\r\n\"The camel's milk is drunk fresh. It is pleasant to the taste, rich, and\r\nexceedingly nourishing. It is given in large quantities to the horses.\r\nThe Shammar and Aneyza Bedouins have no cows or oxen, those animals\r\nbeing looked upon as the peculiar property of tribes who have forgotten\r\ntheir independence, and degraded themselves by the cultivation of land.\r\nThe sheep are milked at dawn, or even before daybreak, and again in the\r\nevening on their return from the pastures. The milk is immediately\r\nturned into leben, or boiled to be shaken into butter. Amongst the\r\nBedouins and Jebours it is considered derogatory to the character of a\r\nman to milk a cow or sheep, but not to milk the camel. The Sheikhs\r\noccasionally obtain dates from the cities. They are eaten dry with bread\r\nand leben, or fried in butter, a very favourite dish of the Bedouin....\"\r\n\r\nThe practice is now the same as it was in scriptural times, when milk\r\nwas looked upon as the principal article of diet, and throughout the\r\nScriptures there are copious references to milk in different forms, some\r\nof which are of peculiar interest at the present day.\r\n\r\nIt may be noticed, for example, that milk is absent from the sacred\r\nofferings amongst the Hebrews, and this was ascribed by the late\r\nProfessor Robertson Smith to the fact that all ferments were excluded\r\nfrom presentation at the altar,[2] it being recognised that, owing to\r\nthe hot climate, milk of all kinds became rapidly sour, and in this way\r\ncame to be looked upon as only fit for consumption when in that\r\ncondition. It has been suggested that the prohibition referred to is on\r\nthe same level as the prohibition of the use of blood, \"as milk has\r\nsometimes been regarded as a kind of equivalent for blood, and\r\ncontaining the sacred life.\"[3] To this day the wandering tribes of\r\nArabia consider the milk of their camels and flocks more refreshing when\r\nit has been slightly fermented or soured by being poured into a\r\nmilk-skin on the inside of which are still sticking sour clots from the\r\nprevious milking, and there shaken for a brief period; but this slightly\r\nsoured milk (the _Oxygala_ of Pliny) is known widely in the East simply\r\nas leben (milk). The name is also applied to what we term buttermilk.[4]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: KABYLES SOURING MILK\r\n\r\n  In the north of Africa the use of soured milk is common,\r\n  and the illustration shows Kabyles shaking a skin full of\r\n  milk so as to sour it. The skin has previously been used\r\n  for the same operation, and, as a consequence, clots of\r\n  milk are left from the previous day's use, and thus\r\n  fermentation is set up.]\r\n\r\nThe use of milk-skins for the carrying of milk is not confined to one\r\ncountry, as, while it is common all over the north of Africa, it is also\r\nknown in the Pyrenees and in some parts of the Balkan Peninsula, the\r\nobject being identical in each case; and when it is intended to make\r\nbutter from the milk, the skin is simply rocked between the knees until\r\nthe butter separates, a process of butter-making which was also used\r\nafter the introduction of earthenware churns.[5] Dried soured milk is\r\nalso used by the Arabs, and it is reconstituted when required by rubbing\r\nit up with a little water, and it is known as _Meeresy_.[6] The ordinary\r\nsoured milk is the common article of diet, and is looked upon as being\r\nnecessary at every meal, and travellers frequently refer to the use of\r\nthis product, as a few references will show.\r\n\r\nCharles G. Addison states: \"A supper was brought in on a round tray. In\r\nthe centre was a huge pilaff of rice, and around it several small dishes\r\nof stewed meats, grilled bones, sour clotted milk called _yaoort_,[7]\r\nbits of meat roasted, etc....\r\n\r\n\"We retired into a tent to breakfast, where we found an immense bowl of\r\ndelicious fresh camels' milk, with thin hot cakes of unleavened bread,\r\nbaked upon the ashes, ready prepared for us. The principal food of the\r\nBedouins consists of flour and some camels' milk made into a paste,\r\nboiled, and eaten swimming in melted grease and butter; boiled wheat\r\nand beans dried in the sun and prepared with butter are a favourite\r\ndish. They are all remarkably fond of butter and grease; the butter is\r\nmade in a goat-skin, suspended to the tent pole, and constantly shaken\r\nabout by the women.\"[8]\r\n\r\nBurckhardt[9] says: \"The provisions of my companion consisted only of\r\nflour; besides flour, I carried some butter and dried leben (sour milk),\r\nwhich would dissolve in water. It forms not only a refreshing beverage,\r\nbut is much to be recommended as a preservative of health when\r\ntravelling in summer. These are our only provisions.\" With regard to the\r\ninhabitants of the Houran, Burckhardt relates that the most common\r\ndishes of these people are _bourgoul_ and _keshk_. \"In summer they\r\nsupply the place of the latter by milk, leben, and fresh butter. Of the\r\nbourgoul I have spoken on other occasions; there are two kinds of\r\nkeshk--_keshk-hammer_ and _keshk-leben_. The first is prepared by\r\nputting leaven into the bourgoul and pouring water over it. It is then\r\nleft until almost putrid, and afterwards spread out in the sun and\r\ndried, after which it is pounded, and, when called for, served up mixed\r\nwith oil or butter. The keshk-leben is prepared by putting leben into\r\nthe bourgoul instead of leaven; in other respects the process is the\r\nsame. Keshk and bread are the common breakfasts. Towards sunset a plate\r\nof bourgoul, or some Arab dish, forms the dinner.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, Taylor[10] says: \"I received a small jug of thick buttermilk, not\r\nremarkably clean, but very refreshing.\"\r\n\r\nThese references particularly refer to the East, from which it would\r\nappear that soured milk was universally known in ancient times as it is\r\nat the present day, and this remark applies not only to Egypt,\r\nPalestine, and Arabia, but throughout Turkey and the Balkan States,\r\nwhere the consumption of soured milk is equally common. It seems curious\r\nthat the use of this commodity should have been confined for centuries\r\nto the East, as we shall see later on that its dietetic value is so\r\ngreat that it is really a wonderful thing that no one has taken the\r\ntrouble to introduce its use to the Western nations until quite\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE HANDLING OF MILK IN THE PYRENEES\r\n\r\n  The handling of milk in the Pyrenees is, more especially\r\n  in the villages, conducted in goat or sheep skins, in a\r\n  similar way to the methods which prevail in Eastern\r\n  Europe, and the picture shows a skin of milk on a small\r\n  farm in the Pyrenees. The churning is very often performed\r\n  by simply rocking the skin between the knees, acidity\r\n  being induced by remnants of the previous day's milk;\r\n  souring of milk is induced by the same method.]\r\n\r\nA curious example of how the virtues of such an article may be\r\nindependently discovered by another nation is to be found in Lapland,\r\nwhere reindeer's milk is the article used. \"The reindeer's milk,\" says\r\nAcerbi,[11] \"constitutes a principal part of the Laplander's food, and\r\nhe has two methods of preparing it, according to the season. In summer\r\nhe boils the milk with sorrel till it arrives to a consistence; in this\r\nmanner he preserves it for use during that short season. In winter the\r\nfollowing is his method of preparation: The milk, which he collects in\r\nautumn till the beginning of November, from the reindeer, is put into\r\ncasks, or whatever vessels he has, in which it soon turns sour, and, as\r\nthe cold weather comes on, freezes, and in this state it is kept. The\r\nmilk collected after this time is mixed with cranberries and put into\r\nthe paunch of the reindeer, well cleaned from filth; thus the milk soon\r\ncongeals, and it is cut out in slices, together with the paunch, to\r\neffect which a hatchet is used, for no smaller instrument would perform\r\nthe office of dividing that lump of ice. It is then separated into small\r\npieces and eaten throughout the winter every day at noon, which is the\r\nLaplander's dinner-hour. It must be presumed, as it is served up without\r\nbeing brought to the fire, that this is ice-cream in the greatest\r\nperfection: here are flesh and fruit blended with the richest\r\nbutyraceous milk that can be drawn from any animal; but, notwithstanding\r\nthe extraordinary fatness, which may be supposed to resist in a great\r\ndegree the effect of cold, this preparation, as our good missionary\r\nremarks with a degree of feeling, as if his teeth still chattered whilst\r\nhe delivered the account, chills and freezes the mouth in a violent\r\nmanner whenever it is taken. The milk which is drawn late in the winter\r\nfreezes immediately after being drawn. This is put into small vessels\r\nmade of birchwood, and is considered by the Laplander as such an\r\nextraordinary delicacy, that he reserves it as the most acceptable\r\npresent he can offer even a missionary. It is placed before the fire and\r\neaten with a spoon as it is thawed. When put by, it is carefully covered\r\nup, because if the cold air gets to it afterwards, it turns of a yellow\r\ncolour and becomes rancid.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the peasants at the present day, soured milk is known as\r\n_yoghourt_, a word which is spelt differently according to the locality\r\nin which it is used. The method of preparation is practically the same\r\neverywhere, and a short description of the process as now carried out\r\nin one place would, with slight modifications, apply to the general\r\nmethod adopted all over the East.\r\n\r\n\"The culture,\" says a correspondent at Varna, \"which is used for the\r\npreparation of yogourt, is known as 'Maya' or as 'Bulgarian Maya.' The\r\nmilk which is to be converted into yogourt must first be freed from all\r\nbacteria by boiling and allowed to cool to the temperature of 45° C.; it\r\nis then inoculated with maya and maintained at an even temperature of\r\n45° C. during several hours. There are two kinds of maya, or ferment,\r\none known as sour, and the other as sweet maya.\r\n\r\n\"In Europe small stoves, made expressly for the purpose, are used to\r\nmaintain the milk at the proper temperature. In this country, however,\r\nafter the milk has been boiled, it is merely poured into a bowl and\r\nallowed to cool to approximately 45° C., then a tablespoonful of this\r\ntepid milk is well mixed (in a small bowl apart) with a similar quantity\r\nof maya, and the mixture, when it has become quite homogeneous, is added\r\nto the bowl of tepid milk and stirred slightly. (One tablespoonful of\r\nmaya is sufficient to ferment one litre of milk.) A cover is then placed\r\non the bowl and the whole is enveloped in flannel and left in a warm\r\nplace for three hours in summer, and somewhat longer in winter.\r\n\r\n\"The process of preparation is complete when the mixture assumes the\r\nappearance of a soft mass somewhat resembling cream cheese, but less\r\nsolid. The flannel is then removed, the bowl uncovered and placed in a\r\ncool spot until needed for consumption. Of the yogourt thus prepared, a\r\ntablespoonful is kept to serve as maya for the following day.\r\n\r\n\"The best yogourt is prepared from sheep's milk, the second quality from\r\nbuffaloes' milk, and the third quality from cows' milk. Yogourt forms an\r\nalmost daily article of diet with the natives in this country.\"[12]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the time stated for the fermenting process, it must be\r\nnoted that since the subject has been investigated so thoroughly, the\r\ntime required for fermentation has been found to be nearer ten than\r\nthree hours, but this will be dealt with in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nHistorically it may be gleaned from the fragmentary references which we\r\nhave given, that soured milk has, from time immemorial, formed the\r\nprincipal article of diet of a great many peoples, and the notable\r\nfeature in connection with it is, that in some countries where it is in\r\ndaily use, the age limit for human beings seems to be very much\r\nextended, and it would appear that there is a direct connection between\r\nthe use of soured milk and longevity. In Bulgaria, for example, it is\r\nstated that the majority of the natives live to an age considerably in\r\nexcess of what is recognised as the term of life amongst Western\r\nnations, and inquiry has shown that in the eastern part of Southern\r\nEurope, amongst a population of about three millions, there were more\r\nthan three thousand centenarians found performing duties which would not\r\nbe assigned to a man of sixty-five years of age elsewhere. It is quite\r\ncommon to find amongst the peasants who live to such a large extent upon\r\nsoured milk, individuals of 110 and 120 years of age.[13]\r\n\r\nIn the ancient dairy practice, as we have seen, soured milk was the\r\nprincipal product, and the extraordinary ages which are recorded of the\r\npatriarchs, if translated into the modern denomination, would not appear\r\nto be so imaginary after all, when it is considered that we have\r\nthousands of examples at the present day of men and women enjoying quite\r\nas long a term of existence. It has been noticed also, that while these\r\nvery old people are able to perform a certain amount of manual labour,\r\nthere is not the same tendency to the mental decay which is so prominent\r\nand sad a feature amongst Western nations, at a period of about seventy\r\nor eighty years of age. It would seem, indeed, as if the habit of living\r\nlong was well known in ancient times, and that, like many other of the\r\nvaluable arts and sciences, it fell under a cloud during the Middle\r\nAges, or, perhaps, the significance of the use of soured milk fell into\r\nneglect, and, even after the revival of letters in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, still remained obscure.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of micro-organisms in perishable products, which is\r\nattributable to Anthony Van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutchman, whose vocation was\r\nthe polishing of lenses, and who lived between 1632 and 1723, altered\r\nour point of view, not only of disease, but of all the functions carried\r\non by the lower organisms. Since Van Leeuwenhoek's time, the germ theory\r\nhas grown to vast proportions and has more especially been applied with\r\nsplendid results to the study of milk. As we shall see later, the\r\nresearches of modern investigators have led them to the conclusion that\r\nmicro-organisms play such an important part in the milk supply, that it\r\nis impossible to carry it on safely without a knowledge of the\r\nbacteriology of the subject. This view began to prevail about 1890, some\r\ntwenty years after Pasteur had shown what fermentation really meant.\r\nSince that time, the progress in dairying has been continuous, and,\r\nduring recent years, attention has been directed to soured milk to such\r\nan extent that it has become necessary for all who are interested in the\r\nhandling of milk and milk products to have a knowledge of the subject,\r\nas it seems clearly demonstrated that, under proper direction, there is\r\nevery possibility of its forming an important element in the\r\nprolongation of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFERMENTED MILKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is considerable variety in the number of soured or fermented\r\nmilks, and they are known by various names, such as Koumiss or Koomiss,\r\nwhich is prepared from mares' milk; Keffir, which was originally\r\ndiscovered in the mountains of the Caucasus, and which is prepared with\r\nKeffir grains; Leben, an Egyptian product prepared from the milk of the\r\nbuffalo, cow, or goat; Matzoon, a soured milk which is prepared in\r\nArmenia from ordinary cows' milk; Dadhi, an Indian preparation from\r\ncows' milk. All of these owe their special characteristics to the fact\r\nof their having undergone lactic and alcoholic fermentation.\r\n\r\n\"Milk left to itself,\" says Blyth,[14] \"at all temperatures above 90° F.\r\nbegins to evolve carbon dioxide, and this is simply a sign and result of\r\nfermentation. If this fermentation is arrested or prevented, the fluid\r\nremains perfectly sweet and good for an indefinite time. Besides the\r\nproduction of carbon dioxide during decomposition, a certain portion of\r\nmilk sugar is converted into lactic acid, some of the casein and albumen\r\nare broken up into simpler constituents, and a small proportion of\r\nalcohol produced, which by oxidation appears as acetic acid, while the\r\nfat is in part separated into free fatty acids, which ultimately unite\r\nwith the ammonia produced by the breaking up of the albuminoids. The\r\nmain fermentation of milk is a special kind which of late years has been\r\nmuch studied, and is known as _lactic fermentation_. Accompanying lactic\r\nfermentation there is nearly always a weak butyric and a weak alcoholic\r\nfermentation.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the organisms causing _Butyric Acid Fermentation_ is a bacillus 3\r\nto 10µ in length, and about 1µ in breadth. It has power of movement, and\r\nwhen cultivated in gelatine, liquefies the gelatine, forming a scum on\r\nthe surface. When the bacillus is sown into sterile milk, the following,\r\naccording to Hueppe, are the changes:\r\n\r\n\"If the milk thus infected is incubated, on the second day a clear,\r\nslightly yellow fluid is seen under the layer of cream; this fluid\r\nincreases from day to day, so that gradually a column of fluid is\r\nformed which is quite clear above, but below is turbid; the casein, at\r\nfirst thrown down in a firm coagulum, in the course of eight days begins\r\nto be attacked, and by the end of two or three weeks most of it is\r\ndissolved. The filtered fluid gives the biuret reaction; it contains\r\nleucin, tyrosin, and ammonia; hence it is clear that the ferment acts to\r\nsome extent as a digestive of albumen. In advanced butyric acid\r\nfermentation, the fluid is most offensive, and may have an alkaline\r\nreaction.\"\r\n\r\nLactic acid was first isolated by Scheele in 1780 from soured milk, but\r\nits exact constitution was not determined until later by Liebig,\r\nMitscherlich, Gay-Lussac, and Pelouze: \"It is widely distributed in\r\nnature, occurring in the sap of the vine and in most fermented liquids,\r\nespecially in soured milk; it is not, however, present in fresh\r\nmilk.\"[15]\r\n\r\nIn all the Eastern preparations referred to, the lactic fermentation is\r\nproduced, followed by alcoholic fermentation, which is due to the slow\r\ndecomposition of the milk sugar, the vinous fermentation being most\r\nreadily set up in milks which contain a larger relative proportion of\r\nmilk sugar and water, such as the milk derived from the mare, the sheep,\r\nand the camel. As these fermented milks have different characteristics,\r\nit is necessary to the thorough understanding of the process of\r\nmanufacture at the present day, to examine them in some detail.\r\n\r\n_Koumiss._--The greatest of all the fermented milks is koumiss, and it\r\nhas been celebrated from the most ancient times until the present day,\r\nas being the principal food of the wandering tribes of Khirgiz,\r\nBashkirs, Kalmucks, and Tartars, who inhabit the steppes of European\r\nRussia and the plains of South, Western, and Central Asia. According to\r\nCarrick, who has written an interesting volume on the subject,[16] the\r\nnomads who inhabit these vast territories are shut up under the most\r\nmiserable circumstances during the winter time and at the advent of\r\nspring they roam over the steppes from morning to night, usually in the\r\nsaddle. The milk yielded at such time by the mares is carefully\r\ncollected, and these nomads consume enormous quantities of it in the\r\nfermented state, this habit having been in existence amongst them from\r\ntime immemorial. It is said that the Scythians, long before the\r\nChristian era, used fermented mares' milk; and there are ornaments in\r\nexistence in Russia, of Scythian origin, which exhibit in detail the\r\npreparation of koumiss from mares' milk. In historical times, the first\r\nmention of koumiss was in the twelfth century, when it is referred to in\r\nthe Ipatof Chronicles. During the thirteenth century William de\r\nRubruquis, a French missionary, wrote about his travels in Tartary, and\r\nhe described how he had first become acquainted with koumiss, and how he\r\nfound it savoury to the palate. Subsequent to this, however, there is\r\nvery little mention of koumiss in Russian history, or, for that matter,\r\nin any other, and the first really scientific contribution on the\r\nsubject was by Dr. John Grieve, who was a surgeon in the Russian army,\r\nand who in the year 1784 sent a description of koumiss to the Royal\r\nSociety of Edinburgh,[17] of which he was a member, and the title of it\r\nwas, \"An Account of the Method of Making Wine called by the Tartars\r\nKoumiss, with Observations on its Use as a Medicine.\" Dr. Grieve\r\nstrongly advocated the use of koumiss as beneficial in cases of wasting\r\ndiseases, and subsequently it was adopted by the medical profession,\r\nwith the result that sanatoria for the treatment of pulmonary\r\nconsumption were established at Samara and other places in Russia, and\r\nmet with very great success; and at the present day such sanatoria are\r\ncarried on, but the bacteriology of the subject now being thoroughly\r\nunderstood, the methods of preparation have been somewhat modified.\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of koumiss is given by Clarke,[18] who says:\r\n\r\n\"Everybody has heard of koumiss, and the brandy which the Kalmucks are\r\nsaid to distil from the milk of mares. The manner of preparing these\r\nliquids has been differently related, and perhaps is not always the\r\nsame. They assured us that the brandy was merely distilled from\r\nbuttermilk. The milk which they collect overnight is churned in the\r\nmorning into butter; and the buttermilk is distilled over a fire made\r\nwith the dung of their cattle, particularly the dromedary, which makes a\r\nsteady and clear fire like peat. But other accounts have been given both\r\nof the koumiss and the brandy. It has been usual to confound them, and\r\nto consider the koumiss as their appellation for the brandy so obtained.\r\nBy other information I could gain, not only here, but in many other\r\ncamps which we afterwards visited, they are different modifications of\r\nthe same thing although different liquors; the koumiss being a kind of\r\nsour milk, like that so much used by the Laplanders called _pina_, and\r\nwhich has undergone, in a certain degree, the vinous fermentation; and\r\nthe brandy an ardent spirit obtained from koumiss by distillation. In\r\nmaking koumiss they sometimes employ the milk of cows, but never if\r\nmares' milk can be had, as the koumiss from the latter yields three\r\ntimes as much brandy as that made from cows' milk.\r\n\r\n\"The manner of preparing the koumiss is, by combining one sixth part of\r\nwarm water with any given quantity of warm mares' milk. To these they\r\nadd, as a leaven, a little old koumiss, and agitate the mass till\r\nfermentation ensues. To produce the vinous fermentation, artificial heat\r\nand more agitation is sometimes necessary. This affords what is called\r\nkoumiss. The subsequent process of distillation afterwards obtains an\r\nardent spirit from the koumiss. They call it _vina_. In their own\r\nlanguage it bears the very remarkable appellation of _rack_ and _racky_,\r\ndoubtless nearly allied to the names of our East India spirit _rack_\r\nand _arrack_. We brought away a quart bottle of it, and considered it\r\nvery weak bad brandy, not unlike the common spirit distilled by the\r\nSwedes and other northern nations. Some of their women were busy making\r\nit in an adjoining tent. The simplicity of the operation and their\r\nmachinery was very characteristic of the antiquity of this chemical\r\nprocess. Their still was constructed of mud, or very coarse clay; and\r\nfor the neck of the retort they employed a cane. The receiver of the\r\nstill was entirely covered by a coating of wet clay. The brandy had\r\nalready passed over. The woman who had the management of the distillery,\r\nwishing to give us a taste of the spirit, thrust a stick, with a small\r\ntuft of camel's hair at its end, through the external covering of clay,\r\nand thus collecting a small quantity of the brandy, she drew out the\r\nstick, dropped a portion on the retort, and, waving the instrument above\r\nher head, scattered the remaining liquor in the air. I asked the meaning\r\nof this ceremony, and was answered that it is a religious custom to give\r\nalways the first drop of the brandy which they draw from the receiver to\r\ntheir God. The stick having been plunged into the receiver again, she\r\nsqueezed it into the palm of her dirty and greasy hand, and after\r\ntasting the liquor, presented it to our lips.\"\r\n\r\nAnother interesting account of the preparation of koumiss is given by\r\nJohn M. Wilson in the _Rural Encyclopædia_,[19] and it shows that the\r\nmethods in use about the middle of last century did not differ\r\nmaterially from those which existed centuries before.\r\n\r\nWilson says: \"Khoumese is vinously fermented mares' milk. Any quantity\r\nof fresh mares' milk is put into wooden vessels; a sixth part of water\r\njust off the boil is mixed with it; an eighth part of old khoumese or of\r\nthe sourest possible cows' milk is added; the mixture is kept from\r\nfifteen to twenty-four hours, covered up with several folds of coarse\r\nlinen cloth and with a very thick board, and without being stirred or in\r\nany degree disturbed, in a moderately warm place till it becomes\r\nthoroughly sour, and sends up a thick mass to its surface; it is then\r\nbeaten and pounded and stirred till the curd is not only broken, but so\r\nthoroughly mixed with the serum as to form a thick liquid; it next\r\nremains covered and at rest during twenty-four hours more, and it is\r\nfinally put into a common butter churn and beaten and blended into a\r\nstate of perfect homogeneity. It is now fit for use; yet it acquires an\r\nincrease of given properties if it be allowed to stand for a few days,\r\nand either then or now it would, if distilled, yield nearly one third of\r\nits own bulk of a weak spirit which will bear to be rectified. Whenever\r\nit is used it must be previously so agitated that its component parts\r\nmay be well mixed together, and it may be kept either in pans for\r\nimmediate use or in casks for more remote use; and if placed in a cool\r\ncellar it will remain good during three or four months.\"\r\n\r\nMares' milk owes its peculiar fitness for making koumiss to its\r\ncontaining a large proportion of sugar of milk, and readily undergoing\r\nthe vinous fermentation, and it possesses a general medicinal reputation\r\namong the Tartars similar to that which asses' milk has partially\r\nacquired in Britain. \"That mares' milk will undergo vinous fermentation\r\nand yield a certain quantity of spirit,\" says a writer in the _Magazine\r\nof Domestic Economy_, \"is not generally known, and it was reserved for a\r\nnation of demi-savages to render this circumstance available as an agent\r\nof health, as well as an agreeable and nourishing beverage. Every\r\neducated person, however, has heard that the Tartars drink mares' milk,\r\nthough few know that this milk is taken on account of its specific\r\nvirtues alone, and not as a substitute for cows' milk, of which they\r\nhave abundance, and with which they adulterate mares' milk when scarce.\"\r\nBut the koumiss is reputed to be much more medicinal than the mares'\r\nmilk itself; and on account of its being free from all tendency to\r\ncurdle in the stomach, and of its possessing most of the nutritive power\r\nof the milk in combination with native fermented spirit, it has been\r\nstrongly recommended by some persons as a remedy for most or all cases\r\nof general debility, of nervous languor, and even pulmonary disease.\r\n\r\n\"Khoumese is called sometimes _koumiss_ and sometimes milk wine.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these references it will be seen that koumiss is an alcoholic drink\r\nmade by the fermentation of mares' milk, but it is also frequently\r\nprepared from the milk of the camel and cows' milk. It is stated that a\r\nsimilar preparation to Russian koumiss is made in Switzerland from cows'\r\nmilk simply by the addition of a little sugar and yeast to skim milk;\r\n\"it contains more sugar and less lactic acid than Russian koumiss, and\r\non account of the much greater proportion of casein contained in cows'\r\nmilk, differs considerably from that prepared from mares' milk.\"\r\nSuter-Naef gives the composition of a Swiss koumiss[20] manufactured at\r\nDavos as follows:\r\n\r\n                      In Grams.             Per Litre\r\n                      Per cent.            (by weight).\r\n  Water                90.346               1019.64 grams.\r\n  Alcohol               3.210                 36.23   \"\r\n  Lactic acid           0.190                  2.14   \"\r\n  Sugar                 2.105                 23.75   \"\r\n  Albuminates           1.860                 20.99   \"\r\n  Butter                1.780                 20.09   \"\r\n  Inorganic salts       0.509                  5.74   \"\r\n  Free carbonic acid    0.177                  2.00   \"\r\n\r\nThe ferments used in the preparation of koumiss are stated by Carrick to\r\nbe of two different kinds, artificial and natural.\r\n\r\n\"Of the natural ferments two have been resorted to. One is mentioned by\r\nGrieve, which he borrowed from the Bashkirs of Orenbourg, and which\r\nsimply consists in the addition of one sixth part of water and one\r\neighth of the sourest cows' milk to fresh mares' milk; the other has\r\nbeen employed, and was, if I mistake not, first recommended by\r\nBogoyavlensky. It is a very simple if rather a tedious method. New\r\nmares' milk, diluted with one third its bulk of water, is placed in the\r\n_saba_,[21] and while allowed to sour spontaneously, is continually\r\nbeaten up. This milk gradually undergoes the vinous fermentation, and in\r\ntwenty-four hours is converted into weak koumiss. The disadvantage of\r\nthis mode of commencing fermentation is obvious--viz., the great waste\r\nof time in agitation. Hence it is only employed when no artificial\r\nferment is obtainable.\r\n\r\n\"In starting the process of fermentation in mares' or any other kind of\r\nmilk, therefore, an artificial ferment is more frequently employed than\r\na natural one. The former is used only for converting the first portion\r\nof milk into koumiss; the latter is always resorted to afterwards.\r\n\r\n\"Of artificial ferments the variety is great, for besides all putrefying\r\nanimal matters which contain nitrogen--such as blood, white of egg,\r\nglue, and flesh--certain mineral substances which act by souring the\r\nmilk are also capable of exciting fermentation.\r\n\r\n\"Now, many of the nomads, whose mares either give no milk or are not\r\nmilked in winter, commence the preparation of their koumiss in spring by\r\nborrowing a ferment from the animal, mineral, or vegetable kingdom. Thus\r\na mixture of honey and flour is the favourite ferment with some races of\r\nnomads; a piece of fresh horse-skin or tendon is preferred by others,\r\nwhile a few resort to old copper coins, covered with verdigris, for\r\nstarting fermentation. In the choice of a ferment they are guided solely\r\nby habit and tradition. As it would be useless, almost impossible, to\r\ngive a list of all the foreign substances that have been employed with\r\nthe view of converting mares' milk into koumiss, it will be best to\r\nconsider the simplest artificial ferments, and those most generally in\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\"The simplest way is that recommended by Bogoyavlensky, and adopted and\r\nmodified by Tchembulatof.[22] It is prepared thus: 'Take a quarter of a\r\npound of millet-flour, add water to it, and boil it down to the\r\nconsistence of thick oatmeal porridge. Then heat separately, in another\r\nvessel, eleven pints of milk to boiling-point, and allow it to cool\r\ndown. When its temperature has fallen to 95° F., pour it into a wooden\r\nbowl or tub, and add the boiled flour to it. The upper and open part of\r\nthe vessel is then covered with a piece of coarse linen, and left at\r\nrest--at a temperature of about 99° F.--from twenty-four to forty-eight\r\nhours. The appearance of small bubbles, which keep bursting on the\r\nsurface of this liquid, combined with a vinous or acid odour, prove that\r\nthe ferment is ready. To this fermenting fluid twenty-two quarts of new\r\nmilk are gradually (_i.e._, every ten minutes) added, and the whole mass\r\nis continuously beaten up for twelve hours. The temperature during\r\nstirring should never be higher than 94° F. The whole fluid soon begins\r\nto ferment, and after twelve hours a not unpleasant koumiss is ready.\r\nThis should be filtered through a horse-hair or muslin sieve, after\r\nwhich it is fit for drinking. This liquid is called weak koumiss; but a\r\nlimited portion of the lactine has undergone the lactuous and vinous\r\nfermentations, and thus the percentage of alcohol is small. Koumiss at\r\nan ordinary temperature remains weak for twelve hours after it has been\r\nbeaten up, and then gradually passes into medium.'\"\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the richness of cows' milk in fat militates against\r\nits being a good raw material for the making of koumiss, owing to the\r\nproduction of small quantities of butyric acid, which follows upon the\r\nfermentation, so that it is desirable, if koumiss is to be prepared from\r\ncows' milk, that the fat should be first of all eliminated, so that the\r\nseparated milk will then approximate to the composition of mares' milk.\r\n\r\n\"The chemical changes,\" says Hutchison,[23] \"which take place in the\r\nmilk under the double fermentation are not difficult to follow; the\r\nlactic ferment simply changes part of the sugar into lactic acid, the\r\nvinous ferment eats up a very small part of the proteid of the milk,\r\nand, at the same time, produces from the sugar a little alcohol and a\r\ngood deal of carbon dioxide; the milk thus becomes sour, it effervesces\r\nand is weakly alcoholic, but the lactic acid causes the casein to be\r\nprecipitated just as it does in the ordinary souring of milk, and the\r\ncasein falls down in flocculi.\"\r\n\r\nAs will have been noticed, it is an essential part of the process of\r\nkoumiss-making to keep the milk in a state of agitation during the\r\nperiod of fermentation, a process which is intended to permit of oxygen\r\nbeing taken up by the fermenting fluid, while, at the same time, the\r\ncasein is broken up into a state of fine division. The casein also, or\r\nat least a portion of it, becomes very soluble, and after twelve hours\r\nof fermentation the taste of the product is only slightly sour, and the\r\nmilk taste still remains. This taste, however, disappears in\r\ntwenty-four hours, owing to the rapid development of the lactic acid\r\norganisms. After this lapse of time the sugar is entirely destroyed, and\r\nthe strong koumiss which results is a thin sour fluid which effervesces\r\nbriskly, and in this condition will keep for an indefinite period. \"The\r\nnet change which has taken place in the original milk may be summed up\r\nby saying that the sugar of the milk has been replaced by lactic acid,\r\nalcohol, and carbon dioxide, the casein has been partly precipitated in\r\na state of very fine division, and partly pre-digested and dissolved,\r\nwhile the fat and salts have been left much as they were.\"[24]\r\n\r\nViolent stirring or agitation of the cultures does not seem to work so\r\nmuch by supplying oxygen to the fermenting liquid, as by ensuring a\r\nthorough distribution of the micro-organisms throughout the liquid, and\r\nthus dividing the casein.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the organisms are facultative anærobes and oxygen\r\nis not necessary. Again, koumiss put up in bottles on the first day is\r\nregularly shaken although air is excluded.\r\n\r\n_Keffir._--Keffir is a kind of fermented milk which has been in use in\r\nthe Caucasus for quite a long time, as koumiss has been in the steppes.\r\nIt differs from koumiss, however, in this respect, that it is prepared\r\nfrom either sheep's, goats', or cows' milk. The process is started by\r\nthe addition of keffir grains to the milk, which is contained in\r\nleathern bottles. These keffir grains are small solid kernels which are\r\nkept in families and handed on from one generation to another.[25] The\r\ngrains are the origin of the ferment, as they disseminate in the milk\r\nmicro-organisms of a lactic yeast (_Saccharomyces kefir_ Beyerinck and\r\nFreudenreich) and also the bacillus _Bacterium caucasicum_, which\r\ndevelop rapidly and split up the milk sugar into carbon dioxide,\r\nalcohol, and lactic acid. Small quantities of glycerine, acetic,\r\nsuccinic, and butyric acids are also formed, the casein and albumen\r\nbeing partly peptonised.[26] Keffir becomes slightly effervescent in\r\ntwenty-four hours, and in that time develops a small quantity of\r\nalcohol, but after three days the amount of alcohol and lactic acid\r\nis much increased.[27] It has been determined that the fermentation of\r\nthe milk is due to _Saccharomyces kefir_, and that the _Lactobacillus\r\nCaucasicus_ does not take any part in the fermentation, a fact which\r\nseems to be supported by the capacity of ordinary keffir for starting\r\nthe fermentation in fresh milk in the same manner as the keffir grains.\r\nThe use of this beverage seems to be universal throughout the Caucasus,\r\nand travellers in these regions have frequently referred to it. Thus\r\nFreshfield[28] states in one part of his book of travels as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The pig-faced peasant against whom we had at first sight conceived such\r\nan unjust prejudice turned out a capital fellow. He brought us not only\r\nfresh milk, but a peculiar species of liquor, something between\r\npublic-house beer and sour cider, for which we expressed the greatest\r\nadmiration, taking care at the same time privately to empty out the\r\nvessel containing it, on the first opportunity.\" And again:\r\n\r\n\"The hospitable shepherds regaled us, not only with the inevitable and\r\nuniversal airam or sour milk--if a man cannot reconcile himself to sour\r\nmilk, he is not fit for the Caucasus--but with a local delicacy that\r\nhas lately been brought to the knowledge of Europe--kefir. This may best\r\nbe described as 'effervescing milk.' It is obtained by putting into the\r\nliquid some yellow grains, parts of a mushroom which contains a bacillus\r\nknown to science as _Dispora caucasia_. The action of the grains is to\r\ndecompose the sugar in the milk, and to produce carbonic acid and\r\nalcohol. The grains multiply indefinitely in the milk; when dried they\r\ncan be preserved and kept for future use; its results on the digestion\r\nare frequently unsatisfactory, as one of my companions learnt to his\r\ncost.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been supposed,\" says Metchnikoff, \"that the chief merit of\r\nkephir was that it was more easy to digest than milk, as some of its\r\ncasein is dissolved in the process of fermentation. Kephir, in fact, was\r\nsupposed to be partly digested milk. This view has not been confirmed.\r\nProfessor Hayem thinks that the good effects of kephir are due to the\r\npresence of alcoholic acid, which replaces the acid of the stomach and\r\nhas an antiseptic effect. The experiments of M. Rovigh, which I speak of\r\nin _The Nature of Man_, have confirmed the latter fact, which now may be\r\ntaken as certain. The action of kephir in preventing intestinal\r\nputrefaction depends on the lactic acid bacillus which it contains.\r\nKephir, although in some cases certainly beneficial, cannot be\r\nrecommended for the prolonged use necessary, if intestinal putrefaction\r\nis to be overcome.... Professor Hayem prohibits its use in the case of\r\npersons in whom food is retained for long in the stomach. When it is\r\nretained in the stomach, kephir goes on fermenting, and there are\r\ndeveloped in the contents butyric and acetic acids, which aggravate the\r\ndigestive disturbances. Kephir is produced by combined lactic and\r\nalcoholic fermentations ... and it is the lactic and not the alcoholic\r\nfermentation on which the valuable properties of kephir depend; it is\r\ncorrect to replace it by sour milk, that contains either no alcohol or\r\nmerely the smallest traces of it. The fact that so many races make sour\r\nmilk and use it copiously is an excellent testimony of its usefulness.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two methods given by Flügge[29] for the preparation of keffir:\r\n\r\n\"In the first, the dry brown kefir grains of commerce are allowed to lie\r\nin water for five or six hours until they swell; they are then carefully\r\nwashed and placed in fresh milk, which should be changed once or twice\r\na day until the grains become pure white in colour and when placed in\r\nfresh milk, quickly mount to the surface--twenty to thirty minutes. One\r\nlitre of milk is then poured into a flask, and a full tablespoonful of\r\nthe prepared _körner_ added to it. This is allowed to stand open for\r\nfive to eight hours; the flask is then closed and kept at 18° C. It\r\nshould be shaken every two hours. At the end of twenty-four hours the\r\nmilk is poured through a fine sieve into another flask, which must not\r\nbe more than four fifths full. This is corked and allowed to stand,\r\nbeing shaken from time to time. At the end of twenty-four hours a drink\r\nis obtained which contains but little carbon-dioxide or alcohol. Usually\r\nit is not drunk until the second day, when, upon standing, two layers\r\nare formed, the lower milky, translucent; and the upper containing fine\r\nflakes of casein. When shaken it has a cream-like consistence. On the\r\nthird day it again becomes thin and very acid. The second method is used\r\nwhen one has a good kefir and two or three days to start with. Three or\r\nfour parts of fresh cows' milk are added to one part of this and poured\r\ninto flasks which are allowed to stand for forty-eight hours with\r\noccasional shaking. When the drink is ready for use, a portion (one\r\nfifth to one third) is left in the flask as ferment for a fresh quantity\r\nof milk. The temperature should be maintained at about 18° C., but at\r\nthe commencement a higher temperature is desirable. The grains should be\r\ncarefully cleaned from time to time and broken up to the size of peas.\r\nThe clean grains may be dried upon blotting-paper, in the sun, or in the\r\nvicinity of a stove; when dried in the air they retain their power to\r\ngerminate for a long time.\"\r\n\r\n_Leben._--In our earlier references to fermented milks in scriptural\r\ntimes, we observed that alcoholic fermented milks were not permitted to\r\nbe presented at the altar. Such offerings, however, were quite allowable\r\namongst the ancient Egyptians, the Arabs and Carthaginians,[30] and from\r\nremote antiquity these nations placed great value on this product.\r\nLeben, which is peculiarly associated with Egypt, is a soured milk\r\nprepared from the milk of buffaloes, cows, or goats. It is usually\r\nprepared by the boiling of the fresh milk over a slow fire, after which\r\nsome fermented milk from a previous preparation is added to the warm\r\narticle, and the fermentation takes place rapidly and is considered to\r\nbe complete in about six hours.[31] The Egyptian leben is valued so\r\nhighly that it is offered in hospitality to the passing stranger, and it\r\nis regarded as so much of a duty to present this milk, that in some\r\nparts of Arabia it would be looked upon as scandalous if any payment\r\nwere received in return.[32]\r\n\r\n_Matzoon._--Matzoon is prepared in Armenia in somewhat the same manner\r\nas keffir is prepared in the Caucasus, and indeed it differs very\r\nslightly from keffir in composition. Its use is universal in Armenia.\r\n\r\n_Dadhi._--In India large quantities of fermented milk are used, under\r\nthe name of Dadhi, and its characteristics are not unlike the similar\r\nproducts in Europe. The specific bacillus has been investigated by\r\nChatterjee,[33] who concludes that it is somewhat akin to the _Bacillus\r\nbulgaricus_ and the bacillus of leben (_B. lebenis_). Dr. Chatterjee\r\ngives a résumé of his investigations which sums up the whole matter\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\"1. The fermented milk of India called Dadhi resembles in all essential\r\npoints the Bulgarian fermented milk as well as the leben and other forms\r\nof fermented milk in use in the East.\r\n\r\n\"2. The causative element of the curdling process of Dadhi is a\r\nstreptothrix having characters similar to the _Bacillus bulgaricus_ and\r\n_Streptobacilli lebeni_, and _Bacillus caucasina_ and the Long Bacilli\r\nof Mazun, in (1) not growing in ordinary media; (2) producing a large\r\namount of lactic acid in milk; (3) producing, besides coagulation of\r\ncasein and splitting up the sugar of milk into lactic acid, no other\r\nchange in milk; (4) not producing any indol, nor peptone, nor\r\nsaponification of fat, nor formation of any gas.\r\n\r\n\"3. It differs from the above by showing peculiar pink-stained granules,\r\nwhen stained with methylene blue and showing peculiarly convoluted\r\nchains in glucose agar.\r\n\r\n\"4. The importance of the organism lies in the fact that, as in the case\r\nof _Bacillus bulgaricus_, it kills all pathogenic non-sporing germs and\r\nalso destroys all proteolytic gas-forming bacilli in milk.\"\r\n\r\nIn the account of these investigations the following table is given,\r\nshowing the amount of lactic acid produced by different lactic acid\r\nbacilli in one litre of milk, in terms of lactic acid--the culture\r\nbeing kept at 37° C.\r\n\r\n  +--------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------------------+\r\n  | Name of the  | After | After | After | After | After |                   |\r\n  |  Bacillus.   |   24  |   48  |  72   |  96   |  a    |    Remarks        |\r\n  |              | Hours.| Hours.| Hours.| Hours.| Week. |                   |\r\n  +--------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------------------+\r\n  | B. lactis    |  1.8  |  ...  | 10.08 |  ...  |  ...  | Observed by       |\r\n  |  ærogenes    |       |       |       |       |       |  Hall and Smith   |\r\n  |              |       |       |       |       |       |                   |\r\n  | B. coli      |  1.8  |  ...  |  4.77 |  ...  |  ...  | Observed by       |\r\n  |  communis    |       |       |       |       |       |  Hall and Smith   |\r\n  |              |       |       |       |       |       |                   |\r\n  | B.           | 12.8  | 16.5  | 20.2  |  ...  | 22    | Observed by       |\r\n  |  bulgaricus  |  -.4  |  -.4  |  -.4  |  ...  |  -.4  |  Gabriel Bertrand |\r\n  |              |       |       |       |       |       |  and Weisweller;  |\r\n  |              |       |       |       |       |       |  the initial      |\r\n  |              |       |       |       |       |       |  acidity of the   |\r\n  |              |       |       |       |       |       |  milk was 4       |\r\n  |              |       |       |       |       |       |                   |\r\n  | Matzoon Long | 10.8  | 12.   |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  | Observed by       |\r\n  |  stäbschen B.|       |       |       |       |       |  Düggeli          |\r\n  |              |       |       |       |       |       |                   |\r\n  | Strepto-     |2.61[34]  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  | Observed by       |\r\n  |  bacillus    |       |       |       |       |       |  Rist and Khoury  |\r\n  |  lebenis     |       |       |       |       |       |                   |\r\n  |              |       |       |       |       |       |                   |\r\n  | Streptothrix | 10.8  |  1.08 | 11.25 | 11.70 | 18.5  | Med.

The hygienic conditions throughout these countries are\r\nnot such as would give the population in the towns and villages any\r\nspecial advantages in the prolongation of life, and while it may be\r\nstated that a pastoral and agricultural life are likely to contribute to\r\nlongevity, these conditions would not account for a general tendency to\r\nlive long in the countries referred to, more than in any other\r\nagricultural area. There are many countries throughout the world in\r\nwhich the pastoral and agricultural existence is general, but it has\r\nnot been shown that in these countries life is prolonged. Hence the\r\nconclusion has been forced upon investigators that the reason is to be\r\nfound not in the pastoral conditions, but in the habit which has existed\r\nfrom time immemorial of consuming sour milk as a principal article of\r\ndiet.\r\n\r\nThere is no curtailment of the use of fermented milks in Eastern Europe,\r\nand the methods of preparation at the present day are those which have\r\nbeen carried out from time immemorial. A local observer states that in\r\nBulgaria yoghourt is made in nearly every household, especially in the\r\nspring and summer. The method of preparation is very simple: The milk is\r\nboiled until a quarter of its volume has evaporated, it is then cooled\r\nto 45° C. and the ferment added. This ferment is a portion of the\r\nyoghourt of good flavour and is called \"Maya\" or \"Zakvaska.\" The vases,\r\na kind of earthenware pot, are enveloped in woollen stuff or sheepskin\r\nand placed in a warm place near the chimney. In ten hours the yoghourt\r\nis made, and it is preserved in a cold place. The great reputation that\r\nthe yoghourt has acquired in Western Europe has caused this \"Maya\" to\r\nbecome an article of commerce. It is sent out by rail hermetically\r\nsealed in tinplate boxes. According to a Sophia chemist, the \"Maya\" is\r\nemployed in the following manner: For a litre of milk it is necessary to\r\ntake about 10 gr. of the ferment. This ferment is diluted with three\r\ntimes the amount of water and put into a bowl previously heated with hot\r\nwater and dried. Into this bowl the milk, previously boiled and cooled\r\nto a temperature of 75° to 50° C., is poured; it is then covered over\r\nand put in a temperature of about 30° C., and, in default of a stove of\r\nconstant temperature, the bowl is wrapped round with flannel or a plaid,\r\nand left to curdle for eight to ten hours. It is then ready for\r\nconsumption. During winter, curdled milk keeps for several days, and in\r\nsummer it becomes sour in from twelve to twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nA similar food to the yoghourt is prepared in the Balkan mountains from\r\nsheep's milk under the name of \"Urgoutnik.\"[38] The milk is poured into\r\na goat-skin or sheepskin bag, and a little of the fermented milk added,\r\nand is then left for some hours in a warm place. The milk consumed is\r\nreplaced by a fresh supply. In some of the Balkan countries, they are\r\nnot content with the fermentation of the milk, they add a little alum,\r\nwhich, under the name of \"typsa,\" is well known for this purpose. The\r\nmilk attains such a solid consistency that it can be put into a cloth\r\nand carried to market.[39]\r\n\r\nThe various forms of sour milk which have been described in the\r\nforegoing pages may be said to be of the traditional kind, and with the\r\nlight of modern knowledge, it has been possible to determine exactly\r\nwhat constitutes the active principle in use in the milk consumed in\r\nthese countries, and, as we shall see, this principle has been applied\r\nso that, at the present day, a pure fermented milk may be obtained in\r\nany country, and there is every reason to believe that should such be\r\nadopted as a general article of food, it would contribute to the\r\nprolongation of human existence.\r\n\r\nIt is due to Metchnikoff, of the Pasteur Institute, that so much\r\nprominence has been given to the use of fermented milks. He gave it as\r\nhis opinion[40] that senility was caused partly by auto-intoxication or\r\nby the poison derived from putrefactive micro-organisms which inhabit\r\nthe digestive track. These organisms increase with age, and under\r\ncertain unhealthy conditions multiply enormously, particularly in the\r\nlarge intestine. Having arrived at this knowledge, Metchnikoff set to\r\nwork to devise some means of combating the influence of these harmful\r\nmicrobes, and set up the hypothesis that the tendency to longevity which\r\nis exhibited in Eastern countries is due to the consumption of lactic\r\nacid organisms in the shape of soured milk. These organisms are more\r\npowerful than those of a putrefactive character and inhibit their\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\"In the presence of such facts,\" says Metchnikoff, \"it becomes\r\nexceedingly important to find some means of combating the intestinal\r\nputrefaction which constitutes so incontestable a source of danger. Such\r\nputrefaction is not only capable of producing diseases of the digestive\r\ntube--_enteritis_ and _colitis_--but even of becoming a source of\r\nintoxication of the organism in its most varied manifestations.\r\n\r\n\"It is some years since I proposed to combat intestinal putrefaction and\r\nits injurious consequences by means of lactic ferments. I thought the\r\nacidity produced by such microbes would be much more effective in\r\npreventing the germination of putrefying microbes than the small\r\nquantity of acids produced by _Bacillus coli_. On the other hand, I had\r\nno illusion as to the difficulty sure to be encountered in any effort to\r\nintroduce lactic microbes into the intestinal flora which has been\r\npreoccupied by a multitude of other microbes. To make surer of the\r\nresult, I chose the lactic microbe, which is the strongest as an acid\r\nproducer. It is found in the _yahourt_ (yoghourt), which originates in\r\nBulgaria. The same bacillus has also been isolated from the _leben_ of\r\nEgypt; and it is now proved that it is found in the curdled milk of the\r\nwhole Balkan peninsula, and even in the Don region of Russia.\"[41]\r\n\r\nIt is a short step from considerations like these to the adoption of the\r\n_Bacillus bulgaricus_ as the most potent of the various lactic organisms\r\nwhich have been examined, and which is likely to play such an important\r\nrôle in the destiny of the human race. The _Bacillus bulgaricus_ may\r\nclaim to be the Bacillus of Long Life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMISTRY OF MILK\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Composition of Milk._--Like all other organic substances, or those\r\nbuilt up in connection with the life processes of plants and animals,\r\nmilk is of complex composition. It is also very liable to change--every\r\none is acquainted with its tendency to \"go bad.\" This instability is\r\nmore or less inherent in all highly organised chemical compounds, and,\r\nindeed, it seems to be necessary that the materials used in growth and\r\nnutrition should be very plastic in a chemical sense, in order, _e.g._,\r\nthat the constituents, say of a plant, may easily be transformed into\r\nthe substances of the body of the animal which feeds on it.\r\n\r\nThe perishable nature of milk--the food of young and growing animals--is\r\ntherefore essential, so that it may be changed easily into the blood,\r\nbone, muscle, etc., so abundantly required in the early stages of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nMilk is a complete food, and, therefore, naturally it is not a simple\r\nchemical compound, but a mechanical mixture of a number of substances.\r\nThe present state of chemical knowledge on the subject does not permit\r\nof its composition being given in detail, but for practical purposes,\r\nsuch as those of measuring its purity and food value, this is not\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nA proximate analysis, in which, at least, some of the ingredients are\r\nlumped together, is sufficient, and has been adopted everywhere by\r\nanalysts. On this basis the average composition of cows' milk may be\r\nstated as follows:\r\n\r\n                       Per cent.\r\n  Water                  87.50\r\n  Fat                     3.50\r\n  Casein and albumen      3.65\r\n  Milk sugar              4.60\r\n  Ash                     0.75\r\n                          ----\r\n                        100.00\r\n                        ------\r\n\r\nThe constituents other than water added together form the \"total\r\nsolids,\" and they amount to 12.5 per cent.\r\n\r\n                       Per cent.\r\n  Water                  87.5\r\n  Total solids           12.5\r\n                         ----\r\n                        100.0\r\n                        -----\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE CONSTITUENTS OF MILK\r\n  In the illustration, a pint of milk is shown in a glass\r\n  jar, and the various percentages of water, casein, sugar,\r\n  ash, albumen, and fat, which make up its constituent\r\n  parts, are shown in separate bottles, the percentage of\r\n  each being stated beneath.]\r\n\r\nMilk varies a good deal in composition; the different breeds of cows\r\ngive varying qualities. The Short-horn gives large quantities of milk of\r\nrather poor analysis, while the Jersey yields smaller proportions of\r\nvery rich milk. During the period of lactation (the time which has\r\nelapsed since the cow gave birth to a calf), care in milking, food,\r\nhealth, etc., all have an effect on the quality of the milk.\r\n\r\nThe limits of variation may be stated as follows:\r\n\r\n                            Per cent.     Per cent.\r\n  Water                       87.5    to    82.5\r\n  Fat                          2.5     \"     6.0\r\n  Casein and albumen           3.0     \"     4.5\r\n  Milk sugar                   3.5     \"     6.0\r\n  Ash                          0.6     \"     0.8\r\n\r\nThese figures are extreme, and it is very seldom indeed that either the\r\nminimum or maximum is reached. Indeed, by the regulation laid down under\r\nClause 4 of the British Sale of Food and Drugs Act of 1899, when the\r\npercentage of solids not fat falls below 8.5 per cent., and fat under 3\r\nper cent., it is assumed that the milk has been adulterated. This\r\nregulation is a perfectly just one. While genuine milk may, in rare\r\ninstances, show figures as low as 7.1 per cent. of solids not fat, or\r\n2.5 per cent. of fat, the right can hardly be claimed of supplying such\r\nan abnormal article to the public as milk of proper quality, and the\r\ndairyman who understands his business, and wishes to deal fairly with\r\nhis customers, can, by attention to the conditions enumerated above\r\nwhich influence the composition of milk, entirely avoid the production\r\nof such a low-grade article.\r\n\r\nIn the nutrition of both plants and animals large quantities of water\r\nare needed. The solids must be supplied in solution or dissolved in the\r\nassimilative processes, and this cannot take place without water, which\r\nalso conveys the dissolved solids to the various parts of the economy,\r\nand in the case of animals removes waste materials. For the most part,\r\nwater passes through the body unchanged, but a certain proportion unites\r\nchemically with the food materials and assists in their digestion. It is\r\ntherefore not surprising that seven eighths of milk is composed of\r\nwater. Blood contains a similar proportion, and this agreement\r\nemphasises the fact that milk is a perfectly balanced food.\r\n\r\nThe fat of milk, which yields cream and butter, differs in some\r\nimportant respects from other fats. Like these, it is made up chiefly\r\nof stearin, palmitin, and olein, but, in addition, it contains an\r\nabnormally large proportion of compounds of certain of the volatile\r\nfatty acids. It is these which give to butter its agreeable flavour. By\r\nthe methods of Duclaux, the following is the approximate composition of\r\nbutter fat:\r\n\r\n                                              Per cent.\r\n  Stearin, palmitin, olein, and traces of\r\n     myristin and butin                         91.50\r\n  Butyrin                                        4.20\r\n  Capronin                                       2.50\r\n  Caprylin, caprinin, and traces of laurin       1.80\r\n                                                -----\r\n                                               100.00\r\n                                               ------\r\n\r\nMyristin occurs in nutmegs; butyrin in another combination flavours\r\npineapples and rum; caprinin is found in cocoanut fat, mutton fat, and\r\nin the offensive odour given off by the goat (from which the name is\r\nderived); caprylin is a by-product of alcoholic fermentation, and also\r\noccurs in cocoa fat; laurin is found in sweet bay; from which it is\r\nevident that there are some curious relationships in flavouring\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nFats are very concentrated foods, furnishing a large amount of energy to\r\nthe body. At one time they were classed together with starch, sugar,\r\nand other carbohydrates as heat-producers, but the distinction which\r\nwas drawn between the kinds of food which were thought solely to keep up\r\nthe temperature of the organism, and those which produced force in work\r\nand other forms of bodily energy, has broken down, and by direct\r\nexperiment has been found not to exist. It is usually calculated that\r\none part of fat is equal in food value to about two and a quarter parts\r\nof any of the other carbohydrates. Milk fat or butter is more digestible\r\nthan almost any other fat, and its importance therefore can readily be\r\nrealised. All the above constituents of milk fat are composed of\r\ndifferent proportions of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but milk also\r\ncontains minute quantities of lecithin, a fat containing phosphorus in\r\naddition. Lecithin is also found in the brain and nerve material of\r\nanimals, in the yolk of egg, and in several plants.\r\n\r\nThe nitrogenous constituents of milk--casein and albumen--are usually\r\nestimated together, and they are reckoned as of equivalent food value.\r\nThe name protein is very commonly applied to the total of these bodies\r\nin milk, or other animal and vegetable foods. They are composed of\r\ndifferent proportions of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, with\r\nsmall quantities of sulphur, while casein contains phosphorus in\r\naddition. Albumen exists to the extent of about 0.6 per cent. in milk.\r\nIt is very similar in properties to egg albumen. The coagulum which\r\nforms on the surface of milk when boiled is largely composed of albumen.\r\nCasein is combined with, and kept in solution by, lime, soda, and\r\ncalcium phosphate, and its amount averages a little over 3 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable property possessed by rennet, of curdling or coagulating\r\ncasein, is well known; rennet is an extract from the stomach of the\r\ncalf, and similar principles are present in the stomachs of man and\r\nother animals, so that the coagulation of milk is the first process in\r\nits digestion. If milk is gulped down in large quantities it is apt to\r\ncoagulate in lumps, and digestion is much interfered with, but if it is\r\ntaken hot and slowly, it coagulates in small pieces which are readily\r\nattacked by the gastric juice, and milk is then one of the most\r\nassimilable of foods.\r\n\r\nNature provides that the milk for young animals is supplied in finely\r\ndivided streams, so that coagulation takes place in the best possible\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe proteids are the most important constituents of food; they are\r\nabundant in the blood, and build up the muscles, brain, nerves, and\r\nother bodily structures.\r\n\r\nBesides these mentioned, milk contains traces of another proteid of\r\nsimilar composition called globulin.\r\n\r\nThe sugar of milk is not found anywhere else. It is a carbohydrate like\r\ncane and grape sugar--that is to say, the hydrogen and oxygen they\r\ncontain are in the same relative proportions as in water. Milk sugar is\r\nnot so soluble or so sweet as the other sugars. It does not ferment with\r\nordinary yeast, but certain special yeasts which are made use of in the\r\npreparation of keffir, koumiss, etc., have the power of transforming it\r\ninto alcohol. Its most remarkable property, however, is the facility\r\nwith which, under the influence of certain bacteria, it is changed into\r\nlactic acid.\r\n\r\nEvery one is familiar with the souring of milk, but perhaps it is not so\r\ngenerally known that there are great differences in the results obtained\r\nin accordance with the conditions under which the souring takes place.\r\nThe skilled butter-maker, by keeping the milk in a cool and cleanly\r\ndairy, obtains a sour milk of a characteristic and agreeable aroma and\r\ntaste, which beneficially affect the flavour of the butter produced. On\r\nthe other hand, if milk is kept in hot and dirty surroundings, the\r\ndevelopment of acidity is accompanied by different bad tastes and\r\nodours, and it becomes unfit for use as a food. In the first case, the\r\nconditions are favourable to the maximum production of the lactic acid\r\nbacteria, and these occupy the field, and largely prevent the\r\ndevelopment of the other bacteria which are present--the survival of the\r\nfittest in the struggle for existence. In the second case, the impure\r\nsurroundings swarm with the germs of many kinds of putrefactive\r\nbacteria, and the high temperature assists these to gain the upper hand.\r\nAgain, the survival of the fittest, in the particular conditions. Even\r\nin cool and cleanly surroundings injurious taints may develop,\r\nespecially if the milk has previously been subjected to a journey by\r\nroad or rail, as is the case in the modern creamery system, where the\r\nfarmers deliver their milk to a central creamery, where it is made into\r\nbutter. In such establishments it is the regular practice to kill the\r\ngerms, lactic and others, existing in the milk, by heating it to a high\r\ntemperature. This process is called pasteurising, after the great French\r\nchemist and bacteriologist who invented it. Pure lactic cultures are\r\nadded to the pasteurised milk, and the souring process is under exact\r\ncontrol, with the result that butter of uniform flavour and quality is\r\nproduced. The same method is made use of in making the special sour milk\r\ndescribed in this book, with, of course, modifications in the apparatus\r\nemployed, to suit the smaller scale in which the manufacture is\r\nconducted.\r\n\r\nThe ash is the mineral matter which is left when milk, previously dried,\r\nis burnt in a crucible. It is a complex mixture, and, as we have seen,\r\nit amounts to about 0.7 per cent. of the milk. The process of burning\r\ndestroys all the organic matter, and, at the same time, alters somewhat\r\nthe state of combination of the inorganic or mineral elements. Attempts\r\nhave been made from the analysis of the ash to reconstitute the\r\ncomposition of the mineral matter as it exists in the milk. The best\r\nknown is that of Soldner, and the following is his calculation:\r\n\r\n                                             Per cent.\r\n  Sodium chloride                              10.62\r\n  Potassium chloride                            9.16\r\n  Monopotassium phosphate                      12.77\r\n  Dipotassium phosphates                        9.22\r\n  Potassium citrate                             5.47\r\n  Dimagnesium citrate                           3.71\r\n  Magnesium citrate                             4.05\r\n  Dicalcium phosphate                           7.42\r\n  Tricalcium phosphates                         8.90\r\n  Calcium citrate                              23.55\r\n  Calcium oxide, in combination with casein     5.13\r\n                                              ------\r\n                                              100.00\r\n                                              ------\r\n\r\nThe presence of citrates will be noted in this analysis. Citric acid,\r\nwhich gives to lemons their acidity, and is also found in other fruits,\r\nhas been proved to exist in milk to the extent of about 0.2 per cent.\r\nWhen alkaline or earthy citrates are burnt or oxidised in the blood, the\r\ncitric acid is destroyed, and corresponding carbonates remain. No doubt\r\nthe function of citrates in milk is to furnish to the body the earthy\r\nand alkaline carbonates which are required in certain of its parts.\r\n\r\nThe mineral constituents of milk have many important functions to\r\nperform in the building up and nutrition of the bodily organism.\r\nPhosphate of lime is the principal constituent of the skeleton, and the\r\nblood must be richly supplied with the alkalies, earths, and acids which\r\nare comprehended in the ash.\r\n\r\nMilk contains traces of many other substances, the most important of\r\nwhich are several enzymes which assist in its digestion.\r\n\r\n_General Properties of Milk._--The appearance of milk is known to every\r\none; it ought to be a pure white opaque liquid, but very generally it is\r\ntinted a cream colour with anatto to give it an added appearance of\r\nrichness. The average specific gravity is about 1.031; or, to put it\r\nanother way, while a gallon of pure water weighs exactly 10 lbs., a\r\ngallon of milk weighs 10 lbs. 5 oz. It freezes at 31° F. and boils at\r\nabout one third of a degree higher than water.\r\n\r\nWhen milk is examined under the microscope, the fat is found to be\r\ndistributed through it in a multitude of minute globules varying in size\r\nfrom 1/16,000th to 1/25,000th part of an inch, and occasionally they are\r\nmuch smaller and also much larger.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 is a micro-photograph showing the fat globules in whole milk.\r\nFig. 2 is a micro-photograph of separated milk, and Fig. 3 a\r\nmicro-photograph of cream, all under high magnification (450 diams.);\r\nfrom these figures the comparative number of fat globules present may be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Micro-photograph of a Drop of\r\n  Whole Milk, showing distribution of fat globules.\r\n  (Magnified 450 diams.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Micro-photograph of Separated\r\n  Milk, showing the almost complete absence of fat globules\r\n  as compared with whole milk. (Magnified 450 diams.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Micro-photograph of Cream, showing\r\n  agglomeration of fat globules. (Magnified 450 diams.)]\r\n\r\nFats distributed through a watery liquid in this finely divided\r\ncondition form together what is called an emulsion, in which the\r\nparticles of fat are kept apart by surface tension. The specific gravity\r\nof milk fat averages 0.93, and compared with water weighing 10 lbs., a\r\ngallon of fat would weigh 9 lbs. 5 oz. It is thus considerably\r\nlighter than the other constituents, and when milk is left at rest, the\r\nfat globules gradually rise to the top and float there, forming cream.\r\nThe difference in specific gravity between cream and milk is taken\r\nadvantage of in the mechanical separator, now so much used, and which\r\nmakes such a thorough separation between the two. Cream is an article of\r\nthe most varied composition, according to the ideas of the person who\r\nproduces it, but it ought to contain at least 20 per cent. of butter\r\nfat, and may be made with a much larger percentage if necessary. When\r\ncream is agitated in a particular way, as by churning, the surface\r\ntension of the particles is overcome, and they run together into a mass\r\nwhich forms butter.\r\n\r\nThe casein of milk is not held in solution in the ordinary sense, but in\r\na peculiar state of suspension called the colloidal condition,\r\npractically the whole of it remaining behind when milk is filtered\r\nthrough clay filters.\r\n\r\nIt is this state of suspension of the casein which makes milk opaque,\r\nbut the opacity is considerably increased by the emulsified fat.\r\n\r\nThe coagulation of the casein in milk by the addition of rennet has\r\nalready been referred to. Acids, either mineral or organic, also\r\nprecipitate it in the form of flakes. Skimmed milk is now largely used\r\nfor the preparation of casein by this method, and the washed and dried\r\nprecipitate is used very extensively in the arts for such varied\r\npurposes as the manufacture of billiard balls, paints, cements, etc.\r\n\r\nThe clear liquid which separates when milk is curdled with rennet is\r\ncalled whey, and contains the milk sugar and mineral salts. The sugar is\r\nmanufactured from it on a limited scale, and is used as an ingredient in\r\ninfant foods, and as a convenient medium in certain medical\r\npreparations. In Sweden a kind of cheese is made from whey, but the\r\ngreat bulk of it everywhere is used for feeding pigs.\r\n\r\nThe comparative composition of different varieties of milk is given in\r\nthe following table:\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n             Human   Cow   Buffalo  Goat  Sheep   Mare   Ass Reindeer Whale\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Water      88.32  87.75   82.57  86.34  81.08  90.38  90.30   67.7  60.47\r\n  Fat         3.43   3.40    7.63   4.25   7.67   1.00   1.30   17.1  20.00\r\n  Protein     1.55   3.50    4.69   4.40   6.08   1.98   1.80   10.9  12.42\r\n  Milk Sugar  6.44   4.60    4.30   4.26   4.26   6.28   6.20    2.8   5.63\r\n  Salts       0.26   0.75    0.81   0.75   0.91   0.36   0.40    1.5   1.48\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Total     100.00 100.00  100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Specific   1.032 1.0315   1.033  1.033  1.038  1.034  1.033   ...   ...\r\n   Gravity\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4 is a photograph of two Petri dishes,\r\n  which have been inoculated with ordinary milk (A), and\r\n  milk that has been subjected to sterilisation (B). The\r\n  whitish bacterial colonies on A are due to enormous\r\n  numbers of organisms, while B is quite free from such\r\n  growth.\r\n\r\n  For the production of a reliable lactic food, it is\r\n  essential that certain precautions as to the treatment of\r\n  the milk, and the maintenance of a suitable temperature\r\n  during the growth of the lactic bacteria, should be\r\n  observed.\r\n\r\n  In the first place, milk immediately after extraction from\r\n  the cow contains only a few organisms, but these multiply\r\n  so rapidly that in a few hours the bacterial content may\r\n  amount to many millions per ounce. In preparing a pure\r\n  culture of any specific organism, then, care must be taken\r\n  to destroy all the bacteria that have accidentally found\r\n  their way into the milk, inoculating with the organisms it\r\n  is desired to cultivate. This is best accomplished by\r\n  heating the milk to the boiling-point of water for about\r\n  thirty minutes, by which time almost all the undesirable\r\n  bacteria have been killed.]\r\n\r\nThe milk of the cow differs a good deal from human milk, and where the\r\nformer is used for the feeding of children it is usual to add milk sugar\r\nto it, and otherwise alter it to bring its composition more in harmony\r\nwith the human article. The high concentration of the milk of the\r\nreindeer and the whale is noteworthy. Perhaps this may be due to the low\r\ntemperature conditions in which these animals live, necessitating strong\r\nnutriment to enable their young to make proper progress in growth and\r\ndevelopment. On the other hand, the milk of the ass is poor in quality,\r\nand probably on this account it is more readily assimilated by those of\r\nweak digestion, to whom it is sometimes recommended. Goats' milk is\r\nricher than either cow or human milk, and its nourishing properties are\r\nwell known. The goat is usually free from tuberculosis and other\r\ndiseases which affect the cow, and its milk is therefore a very safe\r\narticle to use.\r\n\r\n_The Analysis of Milk._--While the analysis of milk can only be made by\r\na competent chemist, there are a number of simple tests and observations\r\nby which any intelligent person can obtain a fair idea of its quality.\r\nThe taste and smell afford some guide, as also the general appearance.\r\nTo judge of the latter, place some of the milk in a tumbler or other\r\nclear glass vessel. If the milk is of good quality it will be quite\r\nhomogeneous and opaque. Any flocculent matter indicates either disease\r\nin the cow or that the milk is old and bacteria have multiplied in it\r\nand altered its composition. When the milk has stood long enough for the\r\ncream to rise freely, the latter should form a perfectly homogeneous and\r\nstrongly defined layer on the top. The quantity of cream may be measured\r\nin a creamometer, which consists of a small glass cylinder graduated at\r\nthe top (Fig. 5). It is filled with milk to the top graduation line, and\r\nwhen the cream has risen, the percentage quantity of the latter which\r\nhas separated can be taken off.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5. The Creamometer]\r\n\r\nThe colour should be like that of porcelain, but, as already stated, it\r\nis a common thing for the dairyman to add a small quantity of anatto or\r\nan aniline dye of a similar shade, to give the milk a rich creamy tint.\r\nIf the milk is of a reddish colour this may be caused by blood from the\r\nudder, although certain foods, such as beets, mangels, and carrots\r\nsometimes give a similar tint. The milk given by cows immediately after\r\ncalving is called \"colostrum\" or \"biestings,\" and is of a yellow or\r\nyellow-brown colour. It is much thicker than ordinary milk, and\r\ncoagulates in boiling.\r\n\r\nIn dirty byres in which care is not taken in milking, quite considerable\r\nquantities of hairs, pieces of manure, and other filth may get into the\r\nmilk. Usually the milk is strained by the dairyman, but sometimes this\r\nis omitted or carelessly done. To test for dirt, a ribbed glass funnel\r\nis useful. Get a piece of the finest muslin about twice the diameter of\r\nthe funnel, fold over twice, so that it becomes one quarter of its\r\noriginal size; open one of the sections and place in the funnel; pass\r\nthe milk into this. It will run through quickly and some water may be\r\nrun into the funnel to clear away the last traces of milk. The filter\r\ncloth can then be opened out and any dirt retained will become visible.\r\nThe apparatus is shown in Fig. 6.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TESTING-GLASS FOR EXTRANEOUS MATTER IN\r\n  MILK.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6.--A piece of muslin is folded as shown and a\r\n  measured quantity of milk is passed through the funnel;\r\n  from the sediment left in the muslin, the percentage of\r\n  extraneous matter may be arrived at.]\r\n\r\nIf a glass funnel is not available, a very small jelly bag can be made\r\nof fine gauze and used in the same way. The washing water should be used\r\nin small quantities and directed to concentrating the dirt in the apex\r\nof the bag. After washing, the latter can be turned outside in, to\r\npermit of readier examination of the dirt. The bag should be well\r\nwashed in cold water, then boiled and dried, and is then ready for\r\nfuture use.\r\n\r\nThe acidity of milk is a very useful guide to its age. Milk has the\r\ncurious property of being \"amphoteric,\" _i.e._, it is both slightly acid\r\nand slightly alkaline when fresh. As its age increases, however, so does\r\nits acidity, and at a rate varying with the temperature and moisture\r\ncontents of the atmosphere in which it is placed. Old and acid milk is\r\nheavily contaminated with bacteria, a proportion of which are likely to\r\nbe injurious to health.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7. Lactometer and Test Tube]\r\n\r\nThe simplest method of testing the acidity is to procure a few little\r\nbooks of blue and red litmus test papers, and these can be had from any\r\nphilosophical instrument maker or laboratory furnisher. The strips of\r\ntest paper are torn out and dipped in the milk. When the milk is quite\r\nfresh it will, owing to its amphoteric condition, change the red litmus\r\npaper slightly blue, and the blue litmus paper slightly red. Old milk\r\nchanges blue litmus paper to a bright red because of its decided\r\nacidity.\r\n\r\nThe above tests do not indicate if the milk is poor or rich, but this\r\ncan be determined by the lactometer, an instrument for ascertaining in a\r\nsimple way the specific gravity. The lactometer is shown in Fig. 7.\r\n\r\nIt is graduated usually from 25° to 36°, corresponding to specific\r\ngravities 1.029 to 1.038. It is graduated to degrees and half degrees.\r\nSometimes a thermometer is combined with the instrument. The specific\r\ngravity rises as the temperature is lowered and decreases with increase\r\nof temperature, so that it is important to make the test at the figure\r\nat which the lactometer was graduated, which is usually 60° F. Failing\r\nthis, an allowance has to be made for higher or lower temperatures. The\r\nmilk to be tested is well mixed, and placed in a deep vessel, and the\r\nlactometer placed in it, holding it at first at an angle. It stands\r\nupright and remains deeper or higher according to the specific gravity.\r\nThe reading is taken on the stem at the level of the milk. As the latter\r\nis drawn up a little round the stem, about a half degree should be added\r\non to get the true figure. Thus, if the apparent reading is 31, the true\r\nreading may be taken as 31.5. This is the average figure for good milk,\r\ncorresponding to a specific gravity of 1.0315; anything above this is\r\nall to the good. Lower readings mean inferior quality, the latter being\r\nproportionate to the lowness of the readings. The tests are most\r\nconveniently made in a glass cylinder (Fig. 7), which may be purchased\r\nwith the lactometer. As there are many inaccurate instruments in the\r\nmarket, it is necessary to go to a reputable maker, because an\r\nunreliable lactometer is worse than useless.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives, in a condensed form, the allowances to be\r\nmade when the temperature is above or below the standard (60° F.):\r\n\r\n  ------------+----------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Temperature.|               Reading of Lactometer.\r\n  ------------+------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     Degs.

Intermediate figures can readily be\r\naveraged. Care should be taken to wash the lactometer with cold water\r\nunder the tap, as otherwise the milk will dry on it and render it\r\ninaccurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHANDLING OF MILK\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN DAIRY PRACTICE\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the dairy industry is a very ancient one, and has been\r\nintimately associated with the development of civilisation.\r\n\r\nWithin historical times dairying has always formed a prominent feature\r\nin connection with agriculture, and the use of milk in one form or\r\nanother has been common to every civilised nation.[42]\r\n\r\nThe greatest progress, however, in the study of milk has taken place\r\nsince about the year 1890, at which time the dairy industry seems to\r\nhave attracted the general attention of food specialists and scientific\r\ninvestigators throughout the world. Since then it has been considered\r\nworth while to enact laws in different countries with regard to the\r\nregulation and control of the milk supply.\r\n\r\nSince 1903 there has been an International Dairy Federation formed, and\r\nit has held conferences at Brussels, Paris, The Hague, and Buda-Pest,\r\nand in 1911 it will hold a conference in Stockholm. The Federation was\r\nstarted in a very humble way in Brussels, and owes its origin, to a\r\nlarge extent, to a distinguished Belgian agriculturist, Baron Peers of\r\nOostcamp, Bruges; but at the present day a general committee composed of\r\nrepresentatives of nearly every civilised nation has been formed, and\r\ndelegates from such countries attend the Congresses, which are held\r\nevery two years. The literature which has arisen out of these\r\nInternational Congresses has been disseminated in different countries,\r\nand has been instrumental in placing the dairy industry on a thoroughly\r\nscientific basis.\r\n\r\n_Milk Supply of the United Kingdom._--The milk supply of the United\r\nKingdom has steadily grown from year to year, and in relation to the\r\npopulation works out at fifteen gallons per head. The manner in which\r\nthese figures are arrived at is shown in the following estimate:\r\n\r\n  The population of the United Kingdom is now about\r\n  45,500,000. The number of cows or heifers in calf or in\r\n  milk in June, 1909, was 3,360,600; the number in 1910 was\r\n  probably about 4,400,000.\r\n\r\n  Of these about 300,000 were heifers that had not yet\r\n  produced any milk. The actual milking class, therefore,\r\n  comprised about 4,100,000 cows and heifers; of these,\r\n  about 600,000 were heifers that calved in the winter and\r\n  spring of 1909-10, and 300,000 were heifers that calved in\r\n  the summer and autumn of 1910. The number of cows that\r\n  produced two or more calves may be taken to be about\r\n  3,200,000; of these about 600,000 should have produced\r\n  their second calf in the winter and spring 1909-10, and\r\n  would be milked as heifers in the summer and autumn of\r\n  1910; the number of mature cows from which a full season's\r\n  supply of milk was obtained during the twelve months from\r\n  June 5, 1909, to June 4, 1910, was apparently about\r\n  2,600,000. A large quantity of milk is yielded during the\r\n  year by cows sold or lost during the twelve months before\r\n  the census. Possibly ten per cent. of the milk produced in\r\n  the twelve months from June, 1909, to June, 1910, was\r\n  yielded by cows that were sold or lost before the census\r\n  of June, 1910.\r\n\r\n  It is estimated that the 3,200,000 cows (including the\r\n  600,000 that up to the winter of 1909-10 were heifers)\r\n  produced, on the average, 44 cwts. (480 gallons) of milk\r\n  per head in the twelve months from June 5, 1909, to June\r\n  4, 1910; the 300,000 heifers that calved in the summer and\r\n  autumn, 30 cwts. (330 gallons) per head; the 600,000\r\n  heifers that calved in the winter and spring of 1909-10,\r\n  15 cwts. (165 gallons), making the total quantity of milk\r\n  produced in the twelve months by cows and heifers on the\r\n  farms, and that produced calves during the twelve months\r\n  (June, 1909-1910), 158,800,000 cwts. (1,746,800,000\r\n  gallons), or about 426 gallons per head, and about 400\r\n  gallons per head for all the cows and heifers in milk or\r\n  in calf in 1910. There remains to add the milk yielded by\r\n  the cows that were sold during the twelve months, and of\r\n  cows and heifers in feeding pastures that were milked\r\n  during the twelve months, June to June, 1909-10, and which\r\n  probably formed one tenth of the whole supply, making the\r\n  total supply for the twelve months 176,444,000 cwts., or\r\n  1,940,884,000 gallons. This equals 2 tons, or 440 gallons\r\n  per head, crediting the whole supply to the 4,400,000 cows\r\n  and heifers in milk or in calf in June, 1910. At 7-1/4d.\r\n  per gallon the value of milk produced in the United\r\n  Kingdom in the twelve months was £58,600,000. Including\r\n  the value at birth of the calves, the total value of the\r\n  produce of the milk-giving class would be about\r\n  £62,000,000. The value of the milk, butter, cheese, and\r\n  cream sold or consumed in farmhouses would be about\r\n  £48,000,000, or equal to about 24 per cent. of the gross\r\n  annual income of farmers.\r\n\r\n  The average consumption of new milk is about 15 gallons\r\n  per head of the population. During the twelve months of\r\n  1911, the quantity required for this purpose will be about\r\n  682,500,000 gallons, or about 35 per cent. of the total\r\n  supply; calves will require about 10 per cent. of the\r\n  supply; the quantity available for butter and cheese will\r\n  equal about 55 per cent. of the supply.[43]\r\n\r\n_The Milk Industry in the United States._--In the United States of\r\nAmerica, where the habits of the people are somewhat analogous to those\r\nin the United Kingdom, it is estimated that the milk from five million\r\ncows is annually consumed, which averages twenty-five and one half\r\ngallons per year for each person, or equal to an ordinary sized\r\ntumblerful each day.[44]\r\n\r\nSuch a vast industry, so intimately associated with the food of the bulk\r\nof the people, naturally invites the closest study, and, as a\r\nconsequence, the literature on the subject, which has arisen during the\r\nlast twenty years, has been of a voluminous character, not only from the\r\npoint of view of practice, but from that of bacteriology, chemistry, and\r\nhygiene.\r\n\r\nA pure milk supply is essential to health, and it seems unfortunate that\r\nthe ordinary milk producer should, in a great many cases, take up an\r\nantagonistic attitude to the scientific methods of handling milk. There\r\nis a body of opinion being created, however, which is likely to alter\r\nthis attitude in the next generation, and this is attributable to the\r\nfact that so much excellent work has been done at numerous dairy\r\ncolleges and institutes in all civilised countries that the dairy\r\nindustry is emerging from a period of rule-of-thumb procedure to its\r\nproper place as one of the technical arts.\r\n\r\n_Transmission of Disease in Milk._--It is not to be wondered at that the\r\nhandling of milk should now be regarded as a technical business, seeing\r\nthat milk-borne disease is one of the commonest with which we have to\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\nThe commoner diseases which have been transmitted by milk are scarlet\r\nfever, typhoid, diphtheria, tuberculosis, sore throat epidemics. Others\r\nof a more complex character have been traced to the same source of\r\ninfection, and the clearest possible evidence has been furnished of the\r\ntransmission of diseases by means of micro-organisms, which have\r\ncontaminated the milk supply.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore necessary to watch over the milk from the source of\r\nsupply to its consumption. It is primarily on the farm and in the\r\ncow-house that methods of handling in a hygienic way should be insisted\r\non, as microbial contamination increases at a prodigious rate, and it is\r\nthe early microbe therefore which does the most damage.\r\n\r\nThe milk in the udder, for all practical purposes, may be assumed to be\r\nsterile, and the contamination which takes place originates, therefore,\r\nfrom external sources.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal means of infection is from hairs which fall from\r\nthe cow into the milk, and many of which are carriers of dangerous\r\nmicro-organisms.\r\n\r\nThere is also a certain amount of offensive dirty matter which may fall\r\ninto the milk-pail, and carry with it undesirable germs.\r\n\r\nThese impurities may, to a certain extent, be eliminated by good\r\nstraining, but a surer prevention is to have the cow-house perfectly\r\nclean and free from dust, as dust specks are in many cases the vehicles\r\nof disease germs. Cleanliness is, in fact, the essential feature in\r\nmodern dairying, not only in the cow-house, but in the milking utensils,\r\nthe drainage, etc., and, above all, the milker should be of cleanly\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nThe flavours of milk sometimes arise from the absorption of\r\nevil-smelling gases in the cow-house, or from a peculiar taint from\r\ncertain roots and feeding stuffs, and in such a case it is desirable\r\nthat aëration should take place in a fresh clear atmosphere, so that\r\noxygenation may have the effect of eliminating and destroying the\r\nforeign odours and flavours which may be present. If this process of\r\naëration is carried out at blood heat, the result is generally highly\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n_Milk Management._--There have been many excellent tables of rules\r\npublished for the management of dairies in different countries, but they\r\nare necessarily framed within certain limitations which apply to all.\r\nThe following is an excellent set, which put concisely the conditions\r\nnecessary to be observed in the modern cow-house:\r\n\r\n   1. The cow should be sound--no disease should exist in\r\n        the animal.\r\n\r\n   2. The feed should be good and free from aromatic\r\n        substances. If these aromatic foods are used, they should\r\n        be employed according to those methods which will not\r\n        cause odours or flavours to appear in the milk.\r\n\r\n   3. The cow should be groomed, and hair about the udder\r\n        preferably clipped.\r\n\r\n   4. The udder should be moistened during milking.\r\n\r\n   5. The milker should be a neat, tidy person.\r\n\r\n   6. The milker should be free from disease, and should not\r\n        come in contact with any communicable disease.\r\n\r\n   7. The milker's clothes and hands should be clean while\r\n        milking.\r\n\r\n   8. The pail should be sterilised.\r\n\r\n   9. The stall should be such as to reduce the amount of\r\n        disturbance of dust and dirt.\r\n\r\n  10. There should be good light, good ventilation, and\r\n         good drainage in the cow-house.\r\n\r\n  11. The cow-house should always be kept clean.\r\n\r\n  12. Feeding and bedding, unless moist, should be done\r\n        after milking.\r\n\r\n  13. A dustless milking-room is desirable.\r\n\r\n  14. Milk should not stand in the cow-house.\r\n\r\n  15. If milk is aërated, it should be done before cooling\r\n        and in pure air.\r\n\r\n  16. The sooner the milk is cooled after milking the\r\n        better.\r\n\r\n  17. Keep the milk as cold as possible when once\r\n        cooled.[45]\r\n\r\nThe supply of milk is conducted, to a large extent, by towns' dairies,\r\nwhich depend for their supplies upon the dairy farm in the country, and\r\nit is obvious that a certain period of time must elapse, in the\r\ngenerality of cases, before a town's dairy receives its supply in the\r\nordinary course, and this constitutes the greatest difficulty in modern\r\ndairy practice, owing to the liability of the milk to absorb bacteria,\r\nwhich during transit may multiply enormously.\r\n\r\nThe multiplying of bacteria in milk at different temperatures is easily\r\ndemonstrated, and the result of this has been stated in various forms\r\nmany times over. As a graphic means, however, of showing the increase\r\nthat takes place in the numbers of germs present, and the consequent\r\nproduct of acidity, the table below by Conn may be given.\r\n\r\nThe consequent result of the increase in bacteria is the production of\r\nlactic acid, which produces the souring so familiar in milk which has\r\nbeen kept in the household at a high temperature.\r\n\r\n  _Numbers of Bacteria per c.cm. in Milk kept at\r\n             Different Temperatures._\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Number  In 12   In 12    In 50    In 50 hrs. or at   No. hrs.

When these\r\noperations have been performed on the farm, milk should be sent as\r\nrapidly as possible to the distributing towns' dairies, and should be\r\ntransported in refrigerated waggons, cooled preferably with ice, during\r\nthe journey. On arrival at the town dairy, it will be necessary to\r\npasteurise the milk--that is to say, the milk should be heated to such a\r\ntemperature as will destroy any pathogenic organisms which may be\r\npresent, and the pasteurising temperature should therefore be in excess\r\nof the thermal death-point of all such organisms.\r\n\r\nPasteurisation owes its origin to Pasteur, and has become an adopted\r\nmethod throughout the dairy industry, and there are many mechanical\r\ndevices termed \"pasteurisers\" (see Fig. 8) which are used for the\r\ncarrying out of this particular operation. The form of one of these is\r\nthat of a vertical jacketed cylinder with paraboloidal surface, around\r\nwhich steam is made to pass, so as to maintain the temperature at about\r\n176° F. Milk is allowed to flow in at the bottom of the paraboloidal\r\nsurface, and is caught by mechanical agitating arms, which revolve at a\r\ngiven speed, and by this action milk is distributed centrifugally over\r\nthe paraboloidal surface, and is forced out by the same action, at the\r\ntop of the apparatus, after being heated.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PASTEURISER\r\n\r\n  FIG. 8.--The milk enters from the bottom and circulates to\r\n  the top of the inside cylinder, which is paraboloidal in\r\n  construction. It is heated as it passes through the\r\n  apparatus, and is discharged at the top at a temperature\r\n  of 176° F.]\r\n\r\nThe centrifugal action is sufficient to raise the milk some three to\r\nfour feet, through a tube, and this is taken advantage of so as to cause\r\nthe milk to flow over a conical cooler, described as a primary cooler,\r\nand in which water is made to circulate. As the hot milk descends over\r\nthe conical cooler it gives up most of its acquired heat to the water,\r\nand, in practice, is reduced in temperature to within 4° of the\r\ntemperature of the water.\r\n\r\nBelow this primary cooler is fixed a cooler of the same size and shape,\r\nwhich is termed a secondary cooler. In it, brine at a temperature of\r\nabout 35° F. is circulated from a refrigerating machine, and, as the\r\nmilk falls over the secondary cooler, it is cooled to a temperature of\r\nabout 40° F., when it may be looked upon as being pasteurised and free\r\nfrom all pathogenic organisms, in which state it will keep for a\r\nconsiderable length of time.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that the milk should, as soon as possible after the\r\ncooling takes place, be delivered to the consumers, and be kept under\r\ncool conditions, either in bottles or in a closed vessel covered over\r\nwith muslin, so as to keep out specks of germ-laden dust.\r\n\r\nBriefly speaking, the foregoing is an outline of what is carried on in\r\nthe ordinary dairy practice.\r\n\r\nThere are many modifications of this practice, such as the introduction\r\nof regenerative heaters, so as to utilise a portion of the heat of\r\npasteurisation, which would otherwise be wasted.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, again, it is considered necessary to conduct the primary\r\nand secondary cooling over coolers furnished with mantles, so that the\r\natmospheric bacteria which are everywhere present should be shut off\r\nfrom the falling milk.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, however, the equipment for a town's dairy consists of:\r\n\r\n1. Steam-boiler to generate steam for pasteurising, scalding, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Motive power, which may be either a steam-engine, gas-engine, or\r\nelectric motor.\r\n\r\n3. Refrigerating machine, which is used for supplying cold brine to the\r\nsecondary cooler. In many cases it is also used for cooling a room in\r\nwhich the milk and cream are stored.\r\n\r\n4. Milk-receiving tank.\r\n\r\n5. Milk-strainer.\r\n\r\n6. Pasteurising apparatus, and primary and secondary coolers.\r\n\r\nSuch a plant is necessary in order to conduct an ordinary town dairy\r\nbusiness in anything like a hygienic way, and is designed only for the\r\nhandling of milk intended for domestic consumption.\r\n\r\nThere are times when another plant might be necessary, such as a plant\r\nfor the separation of milk, or for utilising it for the production of\r\nbutter or cheese, such operations being subject to the fluctuations in\r\nthe milk supply.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes desirable also to use up an excess of milk for cheese or\r\nbutter-making; hence it is necessary to provide such apparatus as has\r\nbeen indicated.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Soured Milk._--The foregoing description has been given\r\nin some detail, as showing the ordinary practice, and we now come to\r\nconsider how it can be modified so as to provide for the production of\r\nsoured milk. It may first of all be premised that within the next few\r\nyears the preparation of soured milk as an ordinary production of the\r\ndairy will be universal, and will form a part of the ordinary dairy\r\npractice. The apparatus, therefore, which is necessary is one of\r\nconsiderable interest to all who are engaged in the dairy industry.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the chapter describing the preparation of soured\r\nmilk in the dairy, this process can be conveniently carried on, so as to\r\nutilise the plant which is at present in general use. The milk can be\r\nreceived in the same way, pasteurised and cooled to about blood-heat,\r\nafter which its preparation as soured milk is a very simple matter, and\r\nonly requires a certain amount of careful attention.\r\n\r\nFor the keeping of soured milk, a cold room cooled by a refrigerating\r\nmachine would be desirable, so as to maintain the fermented milk at a\r\nlow temperature and prevent over-fermentation.\r\n\r\nApparatus has been designed so as to handle soured milk on a large\r\nscale, and one of the machines is shown on the illustration (see Fig.\r\n9). It is simply a jacketed cylinder with a cover and an agitating gear.\r\nThe inside of the machine is nickel-plated, and there is an arrangement\r\nwhereby the cooling may be done rapidly, through a coil inside the\r\njacket, this coil being connected to the brine circulation of the\r\nrefrigerating machine.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CONTINUOUS APPARATUS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF\r\n  LARGE QUANTITIES OF SOURED MILK\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9--This apparatus is made by the Dairy Machinery and\r\n  Construction Company of Shelton, Conn., U S A. The milk is\r\n  agitated inside a jacketed cylinder, where it is allowed\r\n  to incubate at about blood heat. The milk can be rapidly\r\n  heated and also rapidly cooled by means of this\r\n  apparatus.]\r\n\r\nThe machine is filled with milk containing three per cent. of fat, which\r\nhas been previously pasteurised to about 190° F., and cooled down to\r\nabout 90° F.; at this point the pure culture of _Bacillus bulgaricus_ is\r\nintroduced, and the agitator is kept working, so as to mingle it\r\nthoroughly with the milk. The agitator is then stopped until the acidity\r\nshows a test of 0.9 to 1.0 per cent., when the agitator is again\r\nstarted, and cold brine from the refrigerating machine is turned on to\r\nthe cooling pipes, so that the product is thoroughly broken up, and\r\ncooled down to 40° F.\r\n\r\nThe milk is then transferred to a bottle-filling machine (Fig. 10),\r\npoured into bottles and hermetically sealed, after which it is ready for\r\nconsumption. When it has to be kept for any time it should be placed\r\nin a cold room where there is a temperature not higher than 40° F.\r\n\r\nThe process, therefore, is a simple one, and lends itself to the\r\nordinary dairy business, without involving any great expenditure on\r\naccount of a new plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE BACTERIOLOGY OF FERMENTED OR SOURED MILK\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER FOR STUDENTS\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years much work has been done in investigating the\r\naction of various classes of organisms--bacteria, yeasts, and\r\nmoulds--upon milk and its products. While, however, the attention of the\r\ndairyman has been chiefly directed to the propagation of acid-producing\r\norganisms and the use of pure cultures of lactic acid bacteria in their\r\nrelation to butter and cheese making, a new sphere in micro-biology has\r\nbeen disclosed by the study of the effects caused by the combined growth\r\nof two or more different classes of organisms in milk and the consequent\r\nproduction of lactic, alcoholic, and gaseous fermentations. The\r\nsimultaneous occurrence of these fermentative changes is responsible for\r\nthe formation of such beverages as keffir, koumiss, milk-wine, etc. It\r\nhas therefore become essential, in connection with the study of new\r\ndevelopments in the milk industry, that we should make a more intimate\r\nacquaintance with the bacteriology of the ferments involved.\r\n\r\n_Keffir_ (_kephir_, _kifyr_, _kiafyr_, _kephor_, _kyppe_) is the name\r\ngiven to an acid, slightly alcoholic drink, which for many centuries has\r\nbeen prepared by the nomadic tribes in the Caucasus. The characteristic\r\nfermentation is induced by the addition of so-called keffir grains.\r\nThese are yellow or golden-yellow, warty, and furrowed flakes or\r\nnodules, the former varying in size from that of a rice grain to that of\r\na bean, while the latter are often about an inch across and one eighth\r\nof an inch thick. Bearing in mind the fact that the preparation of\r\nkeffir has been carried on for many centuries, it is not surprising that\r\nthe origin of these grains should be surrounded by myths.\r\n\r\nThe belief is prevalent among the Mohammedan tribes of the Caucasus that\r\nkeffir grains were, in the first instance, presented by Allah, as a sign\r\nof immortality, to one preferred tribe. Others hold that, in past ages,\r\nthey were found by shepherds growing on a shrub in the Caucasian\r\nhighlands; while, according to Skolotowski,[47] they were originally\r\nfound adhering to the walls of an oaken vessel used for the preparation\r\nof airam. This is a soured milk beverage similar to keffir, but\r\npossessing a weaker alcoholic fermentation, and prepared from goats'\r\nmilk by the addition of pieces of calf's stomach. This would undoubtedly\r\nserve to introduce various species of lactic acid bacteria, and will be\r\nreferred to in the portion dealing with soured milks. Keffir is prepared\r\nby the Caucasians from cows', sheep's, or goats' milk, and the operation\r\nis carried on in large leathern tubes or bottles. After the addition of\r\nthe grains or seeds to the milk the vessel is placed in a cool chamber,\r\nand the fermentation is allowed to proceed for one or two days, by the\r\nend of which time the normal fermentation is at an end. During this\r\nperiod the keffir grains have increased enormously in size, assume a\r\nbright yellow colour, and lose their sour buttery smell.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the removal of the fermented liquid, a portion of the bottle\r\nis firmly bound from the rest by a stout cord, and the greater portion\r\nof the remaining keffir is quickly removed for use, thus avoiding, as\r\nfar as practicable, any outside infection. After the addition of fresh\r\nwarm milk the cord round the end of the bottle is removed, and the old\r\nand new milk thoroughly mixed for a time in order to ensure uniform\r\ninoculation of the new milk for the next fermentation. During the winter\r\nmonths the leathern vessels are often placed in the sunshine, so that\r\nthe temperature remains at 61° to 65° F.\r\n\r\nThe necessary agitation of the vessel is said to be supplied in the form\r\nof kicks by passers-by or by the children during their play.\r\n\r\nThe beverage prepared in this way is so gaseous in character that it is\r\noften blown forcibly from the vessel during removal, and possesses,\r\naccording to Podowyssozki,[48] a very acid taste.\r\n\r\nDuring any interruption in the preparation of keffir in the above\r\nmanner, the grains are taken out, and after having been well washed in\r\nclean water, are spread out on a clean cloth to dry in the sunshine.\r\nThey thereby assume a characteristic cheesy or buttery odour and become\r\nrather darker in colour. Thorough desiccation is essential in order to\r\nprevent subsequent mouldiness or disease of the grain.\r\n\r\nIn European countries the grains are subjected to a preliminary soaking\r\nin water for five to six hours and then placed in four to five changes\r\nof milk, each change having a duration of two to three hours. As soon as\r\nthe grains commence to rise to the surface of the milk, they may be used\r\nfor the actual preparation. To this end, a small quantity of the grain\r\nis added to freshly boiled milk and allowed to stand for eight to twelve\r\nhours at a temperature of 55°-62° F. with agitation of the flask every\r\ntwo hours. By this time the milk, now known as Sakwaska, has become\r\nabundantly inoculated with the organisms essential to the fermentation,\r\nand after the removal of the grains, may be poured into well-corked\r\nflasks for the secondary brew. The flasks should be kept at a lower\r\ntemperature for twenty-four to forty-eight hours, by which time the\r\nproduct is ready for consumption.\r\n\r\nAccording to the temperature and length of period to which this\r\nsubsequent fermentation is allowed to proceed, the resultant keffir is\r\nmore or less acid and gaseous. The grains may again be used for starting\r\na fresh portion of milk, and a regular supply obtained in this manner.\r\nWell-fermented forty-eight-hours-old keffir should be an effervescent\r\nbeverage with prickling and acid taste and a consistency and smell\r\nsimilar to sour cream. Large, persistent bubbles should form on the\r\nsurface of the liquid and the casein be present as an extremely fine\r\nflocculent precipitate which remains suspended for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nFrom the third day there ensues a gradual peptonisation of the casein.\r\nIf the temperature at which the secondary fermentation has occurred\r\nshould be higher than 72° F., or if the milk has not been sufficiently\r\nagitated, then the casein will be present in the form of porous small\r\nflakes, which on shaking form a fine emulsion.\r\n\r\nThe chemical changes undergone by the milk during the preparation of\r\nkeffir are confined almost exclusively to the milk sugar. As already\r\nstated, a slight peptonisation occurs in old samples, but this depends\r\nvery largely upon the method of preparation and purity of the culture.\r\nHammersten[49] and Essaulow[50] show, however, that this is not a\r\nconcomitant of normal fermentation. According to Hammersten, normal\r\nkeffir contains--\r\n\r\n                            Per cent.\r\n  Water                       88.26\r\n  Fat                          3.35\r\n  Casein                       2.98\r\n  Lactalbumen                  0.28\r\n  Peptones                     0.05\r\n  Milk sugar                   2.78\r\n  Lactic acid                  0.81\r\n  Alcohol                      0.70\r\n  Ash                          0.79\r\n\r\nIn no case should the acid be higher than 1.0 per cent., and the alcohol\r\nmore than 0.75 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Biology of the Keffir Grain._--The first communication on the biology\r\nof the keffir grain seems to have been made by Kern.[51] He regarded the\r\ngrain as a zoögloea composed of bacilli and yeasts, the latter being\r\nregarded as the ordinary beer yeast (_Saccharomyces cerevisseæ_), while\r\nto the former he gave the name of _Dispora caucasica_. As the name\r\nindicates, this bacillus possesses two polar spores, and germination of\r\nthese proceeded in the same manner as with _Bac. subtilis_. As, however,\r\npure cultures of the organisms were not made, and the descriptions and\r\nillustrations made by Kern fail to show any distinctive characteristics,\r\nit seems probable that accidental confusion with other organisms must\r\nhave occurred.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A MILK FILLING APPARATUS\r\n\r\n  FIG. 10--Where soured milk is handled on the large scale,\r\n  a special filling apparatus for bottles is desirable, and\r\n  the soured milk supply should be under cover as shown.\r\n  This apparatus is made by the Dairy Machinery and\r\n  Construction Company.]\r\n\r\nKrannhals[52] succeeded in isolating ten different keffir bacteria among\r\nwhich were several sporulating bacteria. Here too it is impossible to\r\nattach any importance to the results, as the artificial preparation of\r\nkeffir, by means of these bacteria, was not attempted. Beijerinck[53]\r\nstudied the organisms constituting keffir grains and attached prime\r\nimportance to the occurrence of two organisms, viz., (_a_) a yeast,\r\n_Saccharomyces kefir_, which was capable of inverting milk sugar by\r\nmeans of an enzyme (lactase) and afterwards fermented the products with\r\nthe formation of alcohol and carbon dioxide, and also (_b_) a non-motile\r\nnon-sporulating bacterium, afterwards _Lactobac. caucasicus_. The\r\nlatter, when cultivated on gelatine, gave rise to tough warty colonies\r\nabout 1/40 in. diameter, and was regarded as one of the lactic acid\r\nbacteria found in milk which has been incubated at 77° to 90° F. and\r\nafterwards incubated at a higher temperature, 100° to 104° F. Scholl[54]\r\nisolated three different organisms, of which a yeast inverted milk sugar\r\nfor the lactic acid bacteria, while _Dispora_ peptonised the albuminoid\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nAdametz[55] failed to isolate _Dispora_, and came to the conclusion\r\nthat ordinary lactic bacteria and yeasts played the most important part\r\nin the fermentation.\r\n\r\nEssaulow found in keffir grains six different organisms--yeast cells,\r\ncocci, short thick bacilli, bent bacilli, long threads, and motile\r\nbacteria. The two latter would seem to be _Bacillus subtilis_, while the\r\nothers may be regarded as _Bacterium acidi lactici_ (Hueppe), _Bacterium\r\naërogenes_, and _Streptococcus lacticus_ (Grotenfeldt). Pure cultures\r\nwere insufficient to produce keffir, while mixed cultures of _Bacterium\r\nacidi lactici_ and yeasts were effective.\r\n\r\nFreudenreich,[56] to whom we owe a record of very carefully executed\r\nexperiments, could not arrive at a satisfactory explanation of the rôle\r\nof _Bacillus caucasicus_. This organism is described as being 5-6 µ long\r\nand 1 µ thick, slightly motile, and possessing bright refractive spots\r\nat the poles of the bacilli. It is extremely difficult to cultivate, and\r\nforms flat, small greyish colonies of irregular outline. The bright\r\nrefractive spots above referred to are, however, granules taking the\r\nusual stains quite readily, and not spores as supposed by Kern.\r\n\r\nFreudenreich also found three other organisms--a yeast and two\r\nstreptococci. The yeast, to which he gave the name _Saccharomyces_\r\n(Torula) _keffir_, forms small oval or roundish cells 2-3 µ wide and 3-5\r\nµ long. The optimum temperature would seem to be about 72° F.; the\r\nmaximum 82° F. This organism is unable to ferment milk directly, but is\r\nable to decompose maltose and glucose with gas production. It does not\r\ncoagulate milk, but imparts to it a characteristic taste and is unable\r\nto withstand desiccation for more than a few days.\r\n\r\nOf the two streptococci isolated, _Streptococcus a_ resembles organisms\r\nof the group _Streptococcus lacticus_ in appearance, but is able to\r\nferment milk, with weak acid and gas production, and is capable of\r\ninducing coagulation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Section through a Kephir\r\n  Grain--highly magnified.]\r\n\r\nContrary to what one would expect in an organism existing in keffir\r\ngrains, this streptococcus is as little able to withstand desiccation as\r\nthe above-mentioned yeast. _Streptococcus b_ forms smaller cells as well\r\nas smaller colonies than _Streptococcus a_, but produces more lactic\r\nacid and more gas, and retains its vitality after desiccation. The\r\nrelation of these four organisms is, according to E. von Freudenreich,\r\nas follows: _Sacch. keffir_ is unable to ferment directly milk or\r\nlactose, so that its growth must be preceded by that of _Streptococcus\r\nb_. _Streptococcus a_ does not seem to play this part, but, unlike\r\n_Streptococcus b_, is able to coagulate milk on its own account. By the\r\ncombined action of the yeast and the two streptococci, then, milk can be\r\ncoagulated, milk sugar inverted, acid and gas produced by the\r\nstreptococci, while gas and alcohol are formed by the activity of the\r\nyeast. The rôle of _Bacillus caucasicus_ is unknown, but it would seem\r\nto play a part in the formation of the keffir grain itself. By means of\r\nmixed cultures of the above organisms Freudenreich was successful in\r\nobtaining a fermented product possessing in all respects the\r\ncharacteristic properties of normal keffir. On the other hand,\r\nexperiments to induce the formation of keffir grains gave negative\r\nresults, but in this respect the cultural characteristics of\r\n_Lactobacillus keffir_ would seem to give promise of success in the\r\nsynthesis of the keffir grain. Fig. 11 is a photo-micrograph of an\r\nextremely thin section through a keffir grain, after a preceding\r\ntreatment with saffranin. The matrix is composed entirely of long thin\r\nbacilli (_Bacillus caucasicus_), while the peripheral portions, which\r\nare more deeply stained, consist to a large extent of dense masses of\r\nyeast cells with occasional streptococci. In a normal grain the latter\r\norganisms are present on the surface or in the cavities and grooves of\r\nthe grain, and only to a less extent in the matrix. Nikolaiewa[57]\r\nclaimed to have isolated a hitherto unknown bacillus capable of\r\ncoagulating milk by acid production, _Bacterium caucasicum_, not\r\nidentical with, but related to Freudenreich's _Bacillus caucasicus_, and\r\nalso a torula. Although no experiments were carried out, Nikolaiewa\r\nasserts that this organism forms the matrix of the grains. He was able\r\nto produce a beverage resembling keffir, just as Freudenreich and\r\nEssaulow did with entirely different organisms, but his product would\r\nappear to have been slightly too acid and to have lacked the\r\ncharacteristic aroma of the normal product. In the course of an\r\nextensive series of experiments Kuntze[58] found the following\r\norganisms:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) True lactic acid forming bacteria, _Streptococcus\r\n  acidi lactici_ (Grotenfeldt).\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Bacteria of the group _Bacterium acidi lactici_\r\n  (Hueppe) and _Bacterium lactis aërogenes_.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Various torula and yeast species.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) Two species of butyric acid bacteria, _Bacillus\r\n  esterificans_ and _Bacillus keffir_ (Kuntze).\r\n\r\nHis conclusions are: 1. In any case the presence of a yeast capable of\r\ndirectly fermenting milk sugar is not essential. 2. The significance of\r\nthe presence of yeast lies in the fact that stimulation of the lactic\r\nbacteria occurs; further, the yeast exerts a regulating influence upon\r\nthe rapidity of the fermentation proper. The variety is of minor\r\nimportance, provided always that the yeast does not produce an\r\nunpleasant flavour. By the use of mixed cultures of _Bacillus\r\nesterificans_, _Bacillus keffir_, and _Streptococcus acidi lactici_, and\r\na keffir yeast, Kuntze obtained a product that possessed to the fullest\r\ndegree all the characteristic properties of a normal keffir. In such\r\ncultures he was successful in obtaining the formation of keffir-like\r\ngrains. Keffir fermentation is, according to Kuntze, the result of the\r\naction of various organisms. During the initial stage butyric acid\r\nfermentation takes place, but is prevented from becoming predominant by\r\nthe action of the keffir yeast. Simultaneously a true lactic acid\r\nfermentation proceeds and eventually gives place to a subsequent\r\nsecondary production of butyric acid. Finally, then, we have a certain\r\namount of unison in the results obtained by Freudenreich, Essaulow,\r\nNikolaiewa, and Kuntze. These show that, for the production of a\r\ncharacteristic keffir, specific organisms are not essential, provided\r\nalways that those used possess, either individually or collectively, the\r\nessential capacity of acidifying, coagulating, and fermenting the milk.\r\nFor the growth of normal grains the presence of a matrix-forming\r\norganism, such as _Bacillus keffir_, is indispensable.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12--_Streptococcus lacticus_\r\n  (Grotenfeldt) growing on lactose-agar, stained by Gram's\r\n  method. ( X 900 diams.)]\r\n\r\n_Diseases of Keffir Grains._--According to the age and the previous\r\ntreatment to which keffir grains have been subjected, the vitality of\r\none or more of the organisms constituting the grain may have been\r\nimpaired. The results of Freudenreich have shown that _Saccharomyces\r\nkeffir_ and _Streptococcus a_ are unable to withstand desiccation for\r\nmore than a few days, and this is sufficient to account for the frequent\r\nfailures to obtain normal keffir from the grain. Further, grains succumb\r\nto a mucilaginous disease; the cavities become filled with a slimy\r\nfluid, and the grains are covered with mucilaginous matter. They lose\r\ntheir elasticity and become brittle or mealy, but large grains appear to\r\nbe more subject to this fault than do the small ones. Such grains\r\nshould be disinfected by immersion for a short time in two per cent.\r\nsalicylic acid solution, followed by drying in the sun, whereby they are\r\ncompletely regenerated.\r\n\r\nAnother disease consists in the predominance of certain butyric acid\r\nbacteria which impart an unpleasant rancid taste to the keffir\r\n(Podowyssozki). This is generally attributed to the use of rich milk, or\r\ntoo high a temperature during preparation.\r\n\r\n_Koumiss._--Another product of the combined action of lactic acid and\r\nalcohol-producing organisms is called koumiss, kumys, milk-wine, lac\r\nfermentation, or vinum lactis. In the steppes of Southern Russia and\r\nAsia, as we have seen,[59] it is prepared chiefly from mares' milk, but\r\noccasionally from that of camels and jennets. The name is said to be\r\nderived from that of a tribe mentioned by Xenophon and Pliny, viz., the\r\nKumanen, by whom its preparation was practised. After the war with the\r\nTartars in 1215 its use was adopted by the latter people, and eventually\r\nspread to the Turkomanen, Kalmucks, Khirgiz, Mongolians, etc.\r\n\r\nRubruck, in 1253, records the use of a fermented drink--kosmos--prepared\r\nfrom mares' milk, and about the same time Marco Polo mentions the\r\noccurrence of a milk-wine, chumis or chemius, among the Tartars. The\r\nfact that the Tartars were seldom ill, and were almost invariably free\r\nfrom lung troubles, led to an influx of visitors from surrounding\r\ncountries, until finally its use spread to Russia, Austria, and Germany.\r\nAt the present time the best koumiss is that produced in the province of\r\nOrenburg; but specially equipped koumiss establishments, under the\r\ncontrol of physicians, exist in Odessa, Samara, Ufa in the Urals, and\r\nother districts. The curative properties of koumiss have long been\r\nrecognised and its use is indicated in cases of indigestion, chlorosis,\r\nscurvy, tuberculosis, etc.\r\n\r\nRubinsky states that, among the nomadic tribe, of Khirgiz and Kalmucks,\r\na special leathern bottle (Turssuk, Orroth, or Soaba) is used for the\r\npreparation of koumiss, while wooden tubs (Tschiljak) similar in shape\r\nto the old-fashioned churn are used by the Bashkirs, and in koumiss\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nThe fermentation is induced by the addition of koumiss to fresh mares'\r\nmilk, in proportions which vary according to the cleanliness observed in\r\nthe actual preparation. Where the process is carefully controlled, one\r\npart of koumiss to ten parts of milk is often used, but where gross\r\ninfection from outside sources takes place one part of koumiss to three\r\nparts of milk is taken. The mixture is stirred at frequent intervals,\r\nand stored at a temperature of 73°-90° F. Weak koumiss is obtained after\r\ntwenty to twenty-four hours in winter and twelve to fourteen hours in\r\nsummer, but is scarcely ever consumed immediately, as it possesses a\r\nstrong purgative action.\r\n\r\nIt is generally poured into bottles (bottled koumiss); or allowed to\r\nremain in the tubs (tschiljak koumiss); in the former case the\r\nfermentation is anaërobic, in the second it is aërobic.\r\n\r\nStorage of the koumiss upon ice or in a cellar is necessary since medium\r\nkoumiss is converted to strong koumiss in twelve to sixteen hours at\r\nordinary temperatures, while at the lower temperature this occurs only\r\nin two to four days.[60]\r\n\r\nAccording to Biel,[61] either old koumiss or the dried sediment from old\r\nkoumiss may be used for the initial inoculation. It may also be prepared\r\nby the repeated inoculation of mares' milk with soured cows' milk until\r\na fermenting product is obtained. Koumiss may be prepared by a method\r\nstated by Allik[62] to be in general use in the Caucasian\r\nhealth-resorts. One part of beer-yeast is added to four to ten parts of\r\nfresh mares' milk (according to the strength of product required), and\r\nafter thorough mixture of the two liquids the whole is allowed to\r\nferment at a temperature of 70° to 72° F. for two days. One part of this\r\nfirst product is then added to five parts of fresh cold milk, and\r\nallowed to stand three to four hours at 75° to 77° F. It is then poured\r\ninto bottles, and after the expiration of another three to four hours is\r\nstored away in a cellar at about 45° F. This koumiss may be used at any\r\ntime from one to five days (generally two to three) after bottling\r\naccording to the strength desired or prescribed in each individual case.\r\n\r\nThe changes undergone during fermentation consist in a vigorous gas and\r\nacid production accompanied by alcohol formation and coagulation of the\r\nmilk. The coagulum exists in an extremely fine state of division, and\r\nthe liquid froths violently on the bottle being opened. It has a full\r\npleasant acid taste, but should not contain more than one per cent. acid\r\nand two per cent. alcohol. The specific gravity of koumiss is 1.008 to\r\n1.020 at 60° F. Appended is an analysis of two different samples of\r\nkoumiss:\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------\r\n                                 Prepared from\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------\r\n                          Mares' Milk.

Needless to say, this product must possess\r\nsome of the characteristic by-flavour of the yeast employed, and is less\r\nsuitable than koumiss prepared by the aid of a lactic yeast. Schipin\r\ninvestigated the fermentation of koumiss and found three distinct\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nRubinsky in a recent article threw much light on the phenomena of\r\nkoumiss fermentation. According to him, koumiss contains almost\r\ninvariably four different organisms, viz., koumiss yeast, koumiss\r\nbacterium (_Lactobacillus_), _Streptococcus lactis_ (Lister), _Bacterium\r\naërogenes_, and occasionally _Bact. caucasicum_ (Nikolajewa). For the\r\npreparation of normal koumiss only the two former organisms are\r\nrequired; they exceed in number any of the other organisms whose\r\npresence in the dairy is unavoidable. The presence of the two latter\r\norganisms is favourable to the production of good koumiss, as, by\r\ninducing a preliminary lactic fermentation, they tend to inhibit the\r\ngrowth of undesirable extraneous bacteria, etc. In medium and strong\r\nkoumiss they die out on account of the amount of lactic acid formed\r\n(1%).\r\n\r\nKoumiss yeast possesses strongly differentiated protoplasm, but lacks\r\nany cultural characteristics. Abundant growth occurs in milk, and lactic\r\nacid (0.3%), alcohol, carbon dioxide, albumens and peptones, volatile\r\nacids, and aromatic substances are formed.\r\n\r\nKoumiss bacterium is related to the _Lactobacillus_ of various other\r\nfermented milks, and is similar to _Bac. acidophilus_, and possesses\r\nlike these a distinct polymorphism (branched cells, long and short\r\nbacilli, etc.). It is non-sporogenous, has an optimum temperature of 90°\r\nto 97° F., and possesses cultural characteristics similar to those of\r\nthe rest of the _Lactobacilli_.\r\n\r\nThe by-products of koumiss yeast appear to favour the growth of the\r\nkoumiss bacterium, as this organism, like the other _Lactobacilli_, is\r\nfavourably influenced by the presence of small quantities of peptone,\r\nalcohol, and acid.\r\n\r\nThe organisms found by Schipin consisted of a species of _Saccharomyces_\r\nand two bacilli, _Bacillus acidi lactici_ and a non-sporulating\r\nbacillus. The latter organisms coagulate milk at 98° F., but not at room\r\ntemperature, and although a minute description of cultural\r\ncharacteristics is not given it would seem to be related to _Bacillus_\r\nor _Lactobacillus caucasicus_.\r\n\r\n_Leben Raïb_ or _Leben_ (_Laban._)--This is a beverage prepared largely\r\nby the Egyptians, and differs from keffir, as does matzoon, in\r\npossessing a characteristic aroma and taste. It differs also from the\r\nformer by having only a very weak alcoholic fermentation, and by the\r\ncoagulum being coarse and lumpy instead of being extremely fine. It is\r\nmade from buffaloes', goats', or cows' milk by the addition of roba (or\r\nold leben) to the previously boiled and cooled fresh milk. The use of\r\nleben is many centuries old, and it is used in Egypt as in Arabia for\r\nmedicinal purposes, although that of the Syrians and Arabians is said to\r\ndiffer from that of the Egyptians and Algerians. The fermentative\r\nchanges occurring in the formation of the Egyptian leben have been\r\ninvestigated by Rist and Khoury,[64] and also by Guerbet,[65] who found\r\nthat five organisms were normally present. These comprised a\r\nchain-forming bacillus (_Streptobacillus_), a second smaller bacillus\r\n(_Bacillus lebenis_), a diplococcus, a saccharomyces, and a mycoderma.\r\nOf these five organisms, it would appear that four live in metabiosis,\r\nthe streptobacilli and bacilli hydrolyse the milk sugar, the components\r\nof which are split up by the yeast to alcohol and carbon-dioxide. The\r\nalcohol thus formed, together with the glucose formed by hydrolysis, are\r\neventually converted to acid or combusted by the mycoderma species. The\r\nleben thereby assumes the sharp, unpleasant flavour met with in old\r\nsamples. The diplococcus merely produces acidification and coagulation\r\nof the milk. Rist and Khoury were able, by the use of these organisms,\r\nto produce normal leben, especially when the true yeast was allowed to\r\ngrow in the milk for some time before inoculation with the other\r\norganisms was made.\r\n\r\nSome of the half-civilised tribes of Siberia, the Tartars and the\r\nBurgaten, prepare a strong alcoholic beverage, arakà or ojràn, from\r\nfermented milk. This is really a product of distillation, and contains\r\nseven to eight per cent. of alcohol and volatile fatty acids.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13--Photo-micrograph of preparation\r\n  from Armenian soured milk (Matzoon). This is related to\r\n  Yoghourt, and contains, as will be seen from the above\r\n  photo, yeasts, streptococci, diplococci, and a bacillus\r\n  with the morphology of _Bacillus bulgaricus._ This, and\r\n  similar foods, owe their peculiar properties primarily to\r\n  the presence of _Bacillus bulgaricus_ (type A, White and\r\n  Avery), and only in a lesser degree to the yeasts and\r\n  lactic streptococci.]\r\n\r\n_Matzoon._--This is a drink used largely in Western Asia, and is similar\r\nin character to keffir, but has a peculiar taste which distinguishes it\r\nfrom all other fermented milks. According to Weigmann,[66] it is\r\nprepared from buffaloes', goats', or cows' milk, and is used partly as a\r\nmeans of souring milk for butter-making and also as a lactic food, eaten\r\nwith spoons. In the same way buttermilk produced from milk which has\r\nbeen previously ripened by matzoon is used as a beverage. Finally, the\r\ncoagulum (_than_) of such buttermilk is strained off, and, after being\r\npressed, is mixed with meal and dried by exposure to the sun's rays. The\r\npreparation of matzoon is in many respects very similar to that of\r\nkeffir and koumiss, but differs by inducing a comparatively weak alcohol\r\nfermentation. In common, too, with yoghourt, the prevailing temperature\r\nis much higher than is required for keffir and koumiss.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the biology of matzoon, the occurrence of various organisms\r\nhas been recorded. Emmerling[67] isolated, in addition to a yellow\r\npigment-forming organism, _Bacillus subtilis_, _Bacillus lactis acidi_,\r\nand several fungi, a small micrococcus capable of hydrolysing milk- and\r\ncane-sugar. The organism produces and without gas formation, or\r\npeptonisation of the medium. Of the nine yeasts isolated from matzoon by\r\nLindner[68] and Kalantharianz,[69] three were able to ferment milk sugar\r\nwithout previous hydrolysis, while two others, by the simultaneous\r\nproduction of lactic acid and fruit esters, gave to the matzoon its\r\ncharacteristic taste and aroma.\r\n\r\n_Yoghourt and Soured Milk._--Yoghourt is another fermented milk, and is\r\nrelated to the matzoon of Armenia, the gioddu of Sardinia, and the leben\r\nof Egypt. After a preceding boiling and reduction of the volume of the\r\nmilk, inoculation of the mass is made by the addition of a small\r\nquantity of old culture, and it is then allowed to sour at a\r\ncomparatively high temperature. A moderately compact, jelly-like\r\ncoagulum is thus formed, while keffir and koumiss possess a liquid\r\nconsistency. The fermentation necessary for the two latter products only\r\nproceeds, too, at a much lower temperature, at which yeasts play an\r\nimportant part. According to Guerbet, yoghourt incubated for ten hours\r\nat 113° F. contained 0.34 per cent. lactic acid and 0.012 per cent.\r\nalcohol. Luerssen and Kühn[70] came to the conclusion that yoghourt\r\ncontained chiefly a mixture of _Bacillus bulgaricus_, diplostreptococci,\r\nand a \"granule\" bacillus, so called on account of its granulated\r\nappearance after treatment with methylene blue. According to these\r\nauthors, the first two organisms were found in each of eight samples of\r\nmaya (young yoghourt) and of yoghourt itself, but the occurrence of the\r\n\"granule\" bacillus in plate cultures was by no means regular. In\r\naddition, yeasts were found in almost every sample examined, but were\r\nregarded more as accidental infections rather than as essential to the\r\nformation of a typical product. The combined action of the three\r\norganisms already mentioned gave rise to a product closely resembling\r\nnormal yoghourt. Piorkowski[71] subjected Bulgarian maya to examination\r\nand associated himself with Metchnikoff[72] in finding three species, a\r\nstreptococcus, a diplococcus, and a specific organism to which he gave\r\nthe name _Yoghourt bacillus_. Similar results were also obtained by\r\nGrigoroff.[73] Piorkowski's _Yoghourt bacillus_ is similar in form to\r\n_Bacillus subtilis_, but does not sporulate, nor does it liquefy\r\ngelatine. Young individuals are stained by Gram's method; older\r\nindividuals are, however, Gram negative. The optimum temperature is 112°\r\nF. Kuntze attempted to isolate the organisms mentioned by Luerssen and\r\nKühn, and by plate culture procured growth of a spore-forming bacillus\r\nsimilar to Weigmann's _Bacillus matzoon_. To this organism is attributed\r\nthe power to impart a specific taste to the matzoon, but as growth is\r\ncomparatively slow, it can only be of significance in determining the\r\nquality of the curd and cheese prepared from this product. Cultures were\r\nalso obtained which resembled in general character those of the organism\r\ndescribed by Luerssen and Kühn as _Bacillus bulgaricus_ and named by\r\nKuntze _Bacterium W_. Granule formation was transient in this culture,\r\nand the organisms eventually became inactive. Further analysis of maya\r\ngave cultures of the \"granule\" bacillus, but these passed over from the\r\ntype forming irregular colonies (see Figs. 14, 15, 16) to that producing\r\nsmooth colonies. Further, although the granule formation persists\r\nlargely in milk, the organisms soon revert to the non-granular type if\r\ncultivated on agar. By the use of the Gram-Weigert stain organisms from\r\na several-days-old culture on beer-wort-agar gave an interesting\r\nreaction. The bacillar threads are in places Gram-negative, in others\r\nGram-positive, and bear small club-like swellings (see Fig. 14). Results\r\nsimilar to these were also obtained with cultures of _Bacillus matzoon_\r\n(Weigmann and Grübner) and also with _Bacillus acidophilus_.\r\n\r\nNeisser's method of staining failed to give such good effects by the\r\nexamination of fresh maya, as did an alcoholic aqueous solution of\r\nmethylene blue in showing up the granules of the organisms. Again,\r\nGrixoni[74] found, but did not isolate, a similar granule-forming\r\norganism (_Bacterium sardous_) in Sardinian gioddu. As already\r\nmentioned in the description of leben, Rist and Khoury found a long\r\nbacillar lactic ferment (_Streptobacillus lebenis_) which also exhibited\r\nthe irregular greyish white hairy colonies and high optimum temperature\r\ncharacteristic of this group. On account of the similarity in form,\r\nstaining reactions, temperature requirements, and cultural growth of the\r\norganisms described by Emmerling, Düggeli, Weigmann, Grixoni, and Rist\r\nand Khoury, Kuntze is inclined to regard them as belonging to one single\r\ngroup of lactic ferments. According to him the granule formation is\r\nrather variable, and may be induced or suppressed by cultural methods.\r\nNot only do organisms of this group produce far more acid than the\r\nnormal lactic bacteria; they are also more resistant to acid, and are\r\nable to develop in milk to which 0.5 per cent. hydrochloric acid has\r\nbeen added. A comparatively high percentage of alcohol seems to\r\nencourage growth, and this was obtained in milk containing 4 per cent.\r\nalcohol. This would no doubt tend to explain the phenomenon observed by\r\nKuntze that milk is not so rapidly fermented by organisms of this group\r\nas when cultures of diplococci and yeasts are added. Since organisms of\r\nthis group would seem to be widely distributed, the question of their\r\nnatural habitat arises. Luerssen and Kühn were unsuccessful in their\r\nsearch for such organisms in Königsberg milk, but Leichmann records the\r\noccurrence of a long bacillus (_Bacillus lactis acidi_) in milk that had\r\nspontaneously soured at 112° to 120° F. This organism, too, showed\r\ncharacteristic growth on agar media, and produces lævo-rotatory lactic\r\nacid. The examination of calves' stomachs showed, according to Kuntze,\r\nonly occasional long bacilli, but inoculation of sterile milk and\r\nincubation at 100° F. with repeated over-inoculation gave a culture\r\nshowing the characteristic granule reaction (see Figs. 18 and 20).\r\nAlthough plate cultures made direct from calves' stomachs do not exhibit\r\nthe regular contours generally shown by the granule bacillus, yet this\r\ngrowth may be induced by preceding cultivation in lactose bouillon to\r\nwhich 0.5 per cent. acetic acid has been added. A similar organism,\r\n_Bacillus acidophilus_, was isolated from calves' manure by means of\r\nthis acetic bouillon, as was also a diplostreptococcus which resembled\r\nvery closely the typical lactic acid streptococcus. This resemblance was\r\nmade all the more striking by the fact that they were capable of\r\ncoagulating milk at a temperature of 99° to 104° F. Since these\r\norganisms are present in large numbers in manure and also in the\r\ndigestive tract of ruminants, it would seem probable that their\r\noccurrence is not without significance for the operations of cheese\r\nmanufacture. According to Jensen, the practice of applying farmyard\r\nmanure to Swiss meadows has been regarded as absolutely essential to the\r\nproduction of cheese of the best quality; while, on the other hand, the\r\napplication of artificial manures would seem to have been responsible\r\nfor an increase in abnormal cheese. Kuntze found further that by the\r\ncombined inoculation of sterile milk with the diplostreptococcus and the\r\n\"granule\" bacillus from calves' stomachs, together with a yoghourt\r\nyeast, he was able to obtain a product possessing a taste and aroma\r\nlittle different from normal yoghourt. During their investigations upon\r\nthe ripening of Swiss hard cheese, Freudenreich and Jensen[75] isolated\r\nfive varieties of lactic acid bacilli, and were able to show that one of\r\nthese, especially _Bacillus casei [Greek: e]_, was of the greatest\r\nimportance for the production of good cheese. This organism has been\r\nfound by Thöni to be present in rennet tablets, while a related\r\nvariety, _Bacillus casei [Greek: d]_, was found in fresh calves'\r\nstomachs. Unfortunately, staining tests with these organisms were not\r\ncarried out, so that no data are available in regard to the presence of\r\ngranules. The photo-micrographs of these organisms show the small clubs\r\nand true-branched forms. The presence of these diplococci and bacillar\r\nlactic ferments in the intestinal tract of ruminants and horses might\r\npossess some importance for the preparation of yoghourt in bags or tubes\r\nmade from the stomachs of these animals. Finally, Moro[76] has isolated\r\nan acidophilic organism from the dejecta of infants which resembles\r\nclosely, both in manner of growth, resistance to acids, true branching,\r\nand temperature optimum, the granule bacillus and related forms.\r\n\r\n[This group of sixteen illustrations (Figs. 14 to 29), showing various\r\naspects of the Yoghourt bacillus and others of a cognate nature, is\r\ntaken from the _Centralblatt für Bakteriologie_ of Jena.--L.

Mazun_, _Bac. lactis acidi_, etc.[77]\r\n\r\nWhite and Avery[78] have made a comparative study of a large number of\r\nvarieties and species of lactic acid bacteria of the above type obtained\r\nfrom various fermented milks and milk tabloids. Their descriptions are\r\nso detailed and their conclusions are so important that we give them at\r\nlength. According to this work, the whole of the thermophilic lactic\r\nacid bacilli of the so-called Bulgaricus type may be divided into two\r\nsub-types, A and B.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cultural Characteristics of the Bacillus Bulgaricus Group_\r\n\r\nThe cultural characteristics of all the strains of _Bacillus bulgaricus_\r\n(granule bacillus) are as follows:\r\n\r\n_In Whey Agar._--All strains exhibit wide variation in size, 2 µ to 50 µ\r\nlong and about 1 µ broad.\r\n\r\nAlmost all individuals are intensely Gram-positive, and show regularity\r\nof outline. All strains show involution form, exhibiting vacuoles, and\r\noften show empty cell membranes. The latter are Gram-negative, and vary\r\ngreatly in both dimensions as well as in form. All strains show tendency\r\nto chain formation, some being arranged in chains of six to twenty-five\r\nsegments, which may contain both Gram-positive and Gram-negative\r\nindividuals. Type B exhibits Gram-negative spherical bodies varying from\r\n0.25 µ to 1 µ in size, adhering to the sides of some of the\r\nGram-negative individuals.\r\n\r\n_In Whey._--In this medium there is a marked tendency toward\r\ndegeneration and involution. In the early stages of incubation, at 100°\r\nto 112° F., the bacilli are uniform in size and intensely Gram-positive;\r\nin succeeding stages the irregular, vacuolated, inflated, and ruptured\r\nforms predominate. Between the eighteenth and twenty-fourth hours of\r\nincubation at 112° F. the strains of type A develop oval to\r\nkidney-shaped nodules attached to a stem extending from the cell\r\nsubstance. As the incubation is prolonged these nodules increase in\r\nsize, often measuring 1 µ to 2 µ in length; this nodule formation occurs\r\nat the expense of the cell protoplasm, and appears to be a marked\r\ncharacteristic of growth in whey. Cultures of type B do not form nodules\r\nor clubs, but small spherical bodies more or less securely attached to\r\nthe cell wall are seen. Again, type A assumes the form of small bacilli\r\nin chains, while type B strains develop to a greater length and exist\r\nalmost exclusively as single isolated forms. True branching has been\r\nobserved in strains of type B.\r\n\r\n_In Milk._--In milk there is a tendency to thread-formation consisting\r\nof four to ten segments in the case of type A, while type B shows longer\r\nand more curved forms. With increasing age of the culture there also\r\nappears to be increase in the length of the organisms. All strains are\r\nnon-motile, non-sporogenous, and non-capsule-forming.\r\n\r\n_Staining Reactions._--All strains are readily stained by the usual\r\naniline dyes.\r\n\r\n_A. Gram's Method._--Young individuals give an intense reaction with\r\nthis stain; old bacilli are easily decolourised, and degenerate forms\r\nare always Gram-negative, while single individuals have been observed\r\nwhich showed gradation from one pole of the cell to the other.\r\n\r\n_B. Loeffler's Methylene Blue._--According to the behaviour of the\r\norganisms studied, a separation into two types appears possible, type A\r\nbeing uniformly impregnated, while type B shows distinct\r\ndifferentiation. The cell body is seen to contain a varying number of\r\nround to oval bodies or granules. This is the appearance already\r\nmentioned by Düggeli, Luerssen and Kühn, and Kuntze, and from which the\r\ngranule bacillus derives its name. In opposition to the observations of\r\nKuntze, the occurrence of granules was not found to be variable; it was,\r\nindeed, so constant as to constitute a distinguishing characteristic\r\nbetween the two types. The organisms of this group are difficult to\r\ncultivate, and freshly isolated growth is obtainable only on media\r\ncontaining whey, malt, or in milk. They grow equally well under aërobic\r\nor anaërobic conditions. The optimum temperature for growth is 113° to\r\n115° F.; growth is fair at 85° F., slight at 75° F., and does not take\r\nplace at 68° F.\r\n\r\nColonies on whey agar are round to irregular, greyish white, curled and\r\nfilamentous, often streaming, and in a few cases smooth and even in\r\nstructure. Gelatine is not liquefied. There is no surface growth on\r\ngelatine stab-cultures. Along the stab the growth is filiform, beaded,\r\nwith subsequent horizontally projecting ramifications. Milk is\r\ncoagulated in eight to eighteen hours at 112° F., and is the most\r\nfavourable medium for growth.\r\n\r\n[I am indebted for this group of illustrations (seventeen in number) to\r\nthe editor of _Bacteriotherapy,_ New York, U.S.A.--L.M.D.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 30--Photo micrograph of preparation\r\n  made from Yoghourt, showing yeast cells, large lactic\r\n  diplococci, small slender bacilli and many large bacilli\r\n  possessing the morphology of _Bacillus bulgaricus_. Yeast\r\n  cells are almost invariably found in native Yoghourt, but\r\n  do not appear to be essential to the production of a\r\n  tropical beverage. Indeed, they would seem to be\r\n  responsible for the unpleasant astringent taste often met\r\n  with in old samples of this product.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 31--Photo micrograph of smear from\r\n  Greek Curdled Milk called \"Giaourti,\" and showing yeast\r\n  cells, long bacilli and a mould (_Oidium lactis_),\r\n  possessing very large elongate cells. The presence of the\r\n  latter is very undesirable, as it rapidly combusts the\r\n  lactic acid, digests the casein, and imparts a strong\r\n  unpleasant cheesy flavour to the beverage.]\r\n\r\nType A produces 2.7 per cent. to 3.7 per cent. inactive lactic acid in\r\nmilk, while type B produces only 1.2 per cent. to 1.6 per cent.\r\nlævo-rotatory lactic acid in milk. There is a small quantity of acetic,\r\nformic, and succinic acids formed. The conclusions of White and Avery\r\nare:\r\n\r\nI. A review of the morphological culture and biochemical features of the\r\nlactic acid producing bacilli from yoghourt, matzoon, and leben, appears\r\nto justify their classification as a single group.\r\n\r\nII. This group would seem to be identical with _Bacterium caucasicum_\r\n(Kern).\r\n\r\nIII. The significant variations exhibited by these bacilli in regard to\r\nthe presence or absence of granules demonstrable by differential stains,\r\nthe degree of lactic acid production, and the nature of the acid\r\nproduced, suggest a division into two different types--the true type A,\r\nand the paratype B.\r\n\r\nQuite recently Hastings and Hammer[79] recorded the isolation from milk\r\nof an organism producing more acid than either _Bacterium coli commune_\r\nor _Bacillus lactis acidi_. It is characterised by possessing a high\r\noptimum temperature, and by the limited conditions under which it grows\r\non nutrient media. On this account these investigators suppose it to be\r\nrelated to those described in the paragraphs on fermented milks, leben,\r\nmatzoon, etc., and which are regarded by Kuntze as being identical.\r\n\r\nSimilarly Boutroux[80] found 1.5 per cent. acidity produced in a\r\nsolution containing albuminous matter and glucose; while Richet[81]\r\nstates that with the addition of gastric juice to milk as much as four\r\nper cent. acidity may be formed. After storing samples of milk for eight\r\ndays at 100° F., Koning[82] found 2.35 per cent. and 2.5 acid; while\r\nsimilar samples stored at 60° to 62° F. for the same period only\r\ndeveloped 0.9 per cent. Heinemann[83] records the production of 3.0 per\r\ncent. acid in milk incubated at 100° F.; and Jensen states that\r\n_Bacillus casei [Greek: e]_ is capable of developing 2.7 per cent.\r\nlactic acid.\r\n\r\nDr. H. B. Hutchinson, bacteriologist at Rothamsted Experimental Station,\r\nhas also been successful in isolating a bacillus from English market\r\nmilk resembling in every particular those classified by White and Avery\r\nas type A.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 32 is a photo-micrograph of soured\r\n  milk inoculated with a tablet containing viable and pure\r\n  cultures of _Bacillus bulgaricus_, and incubated for\r\n  seventy-two hours. These tablets constitute a valuable\r\n  means of preparing soured milk for therapeutic purposes.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 33 is a photo-micrograph of milk\r\n  inoculated with a ferment tablet in which _Bacillus\r\n  bulgaricus_ is no longer viable, and the only growth\r\n  obtained is that of an organism allied to the _Bacillus\r\n  subtilis_ (Hay bacillus) group. Such milk would be\r\n  absolutely without value.]\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that organisms related to those of Oriental and\r\nOccidental milk beverages are present in conditions where it is\r\nimpossible for them to attain to any active growth. The same class of\r\norganism has also been found in many cases in butter and cheese\r\nthroughout the United States.\r\n\r\nOf recent years the consumption of milk fermented by these organisms has\r\nbeen introduced more or less successfully into all European countries.\r\nThis custom is due, as we have seen,[84] to a very great extent to the\r\nannouncement of Metchnikoff[85] that the action of such organisms in the\r\nalimentary tract conduce to a prolongation of life. Moro found that the\r\ndejecta of children contain large numbers of _Bac. lacidophilus_ and\r\n_Bac. bifidus_, but, as age advances, the bacterial flora of the\r\nintestines tends to change. The number of acid-producing organisms\r\ngradually becomes less, and other bacteria capable of producing\r\nfar-reaching decomposition of albuminoid matter tend to increase.\r\n\r\nWorking on the assumption that senility is partially due to the\r\nabsorption of by-products formed from albuminoid food by the\r\ndecomposing or putrefactive bacteria mentioned, Metchnikoff instituted a\r\nsearch for organisms capable of suppressing the growth of the\r\nputrefactive bacteria.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that milk allowed to become sour will keep for a\r\nconsiderably longer period in hot weather than if lactic bacteria had\r\nnot grown. This preservative action of lactic acid also comes into play\r\nin the manufacture of sauerkraut and in the preservation of meat by\r\nimmersion in sour milk.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Photo-micrograph of smear of\r\n  culture of _Bacillus bulgaricus_, recommended by\r\n  Metchnikoff for use in cases of intestinal\r\n  auto-intoxication. Unlike the ferments of normally soured\r\n  milk, which are sometimes indifferent, or even injurious,\r\n  in their action, this bacillus is capable of growth at\r\n  blood heat, and, by producing much larger quantities of\r\n  lactic acid than such organisms as _Streptococcus\r\n  lacticus_, _Bacillus coli commune_, or _Bacteria lacticus\r\n  aërogenes_, inhibits the multiplication of bacteria\r\n  responsible for the putrefaction of albuminoid food in the\r\n  intestines.]\r\n\r\nBienstock has shown that the growth of _Bac. putrificus_ is inhibited by\r\nthe action of _Bact. coli commune_, which is capable of setting up a\r\nslight lactic acid fermentation. _Bact. coli commune_, however, gives\r\nrise to substances of an injurious character, and, although present very\r\nabundantly in the intestinal tract, it may by reduced almost entirely by\r\nthe active growth of lactic acid bacteria. This fact is of great value\r\nto the cheese-maker, since by the addition of a lactic acid culture\r\n(starter) to milk before renneting, gas-producing bacteria such as\r\n_Bact. coli_ may be checked in growth. Since the ordinary lactic acid\r\nbacteria such as _Streptococcus lacticus_, _Bac. lactis acidi_, and\r\nothers, are incapable of growth at blood temperature, it appeared\r\nnecessary to procure cultures of lactic bacteria able to grow at\r\ntemperatures of 100° F. to 112° F. Such an organism was found in\r\nBulgarian soured milk (yoghourt), and was considered pre-eminently\r\nadapted to this purpose. As has been shown in the preceding paragraphs,\r\nthis organism is merely one of a large group of bacteria found\r\ndistributed in the intestinal canal of many domestic animals, in manure,\r\nand in ordinary market milk. It is then not surprising that the\r\nintroduction into the intestinal tract of bacteria of the type\r\n_Bulgaricus_ in the form of tabloids has not met with any decided\r\nsuccess. Although it was considered to be merely necessary to introduce\r\nthe desired type of organism into the body, and the amount of lactic\r\nacid taken into the system by the administration of soured milks was\r\nlooked upon as of secondary importance, yet, it would seem, in the light\r\nof recent investigations, that benefits derived from a soured milk\r\nregimen are attributable in part to a chemical as well as a purely\r\nbacterial action. This receives support from the fact that soured milk\r\nbeverages prepared by the use of ordinary lactic bacteria, distinct from\r\nthose of the _Bulgaricus_ type, often exert a beneficial influence upon\r\nhuman beings even although the organisms responsible for the\r\nfermentation are incapable of growth at blood temperature.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned in conclusion that cultures prepared by the use of\r\norganisms of the type _Streptococcus lacticus_ combined with _Bac.\r\nbulgaricus_ possess a more agreeable flavour and aroma than those\r\nprepared from a pure culture of _Bulgaricus_ alone.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 35--_Bacillus bulgaricus_, showing the\r\n  cultures in English cow's milk. (Magnified 450 diams.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 36--Photo-micrograph of pure culture\r\n  of _Bacillus bulgaricus_. The administration of cultures\r\n  of this organism is indicated in all cases of intestinal\r\n  ailments, caused by the excessive growth of proteolytic\r\n  bacteria, and consequent putrefaction of foods in the\r\n  alimentary tract. By the formation of large quantities of\r\n  lactic acid, a state of asepsis is ensured, which is\r\n  particularly valuable in cases of operations on the\r\n  abdomen and intestines.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 37.--Photo-micrograph of smear of\r\n  combined culture of _Bacillus bulgaricus_ and _Bacteria\r\n  paralacticus_. This double culture possesses an advantage\r\n  over single cultures in that, while the characteristic\r\n  disinfecting action of the former is retained, any\r\n  secondary action of the growth of this organism upon the\r\n  milk-fat is checked by the growth of _Bacillus\r\n  paralacticus_, thus ensuring the production of a more\r\n  palatable product.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE PREPARATION OF SOURED MILK IN THE HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no great difficulty in making soured milk at home: the\r\nnecessary operations are quite simple, but at the same time they must be\r\nconducted with precision and care, otherwise the results may be\r\nunsatisfactory and disagreeable; there may even sometimes be danger in\r\nbadly prepared sour milk. It is always an advantage in such matters to\r\nunderstand the reason of things, and a few notes on the surrounding\r\nconditions, and what has to be accomplished, may be of assistance to the\r\nwould-be experimenter.\r\n\r\nThe majority of intelligent people are now acquainted with the fact that\r\nthe germs of bacteria are to be found everywhere on the surface of the\r\nearth, in air, and in water, and that they are the sole cause of the\r\ndecay of all manner of perishable articles.\r\n\r\nThe distribution is unequal--bacteria are much more plentiful where\r\nthere is decaying matter--in dirty houses, sewage, or other contaminated\r\nwater, etc. Milk is a splendid food for bacteria, and numerous varieties\r\nmultiply in it exceedingly, and many of these are injurious, producing\r\nputrefactive changes which render the milk unwholesome, even poisonous\r\nin some cases. Others are beneficial, and are absolutely necessary for\r\nthe souring of milk for making butter or cheese and for the ripening of\r\nthe latter. The soured milk which is the subject of this book is the\r\nwork of certain lactic-acid-producing bacteria, and the problem we have\r\nbefore us is to encourage the growth of the latter to the uttermost and\r\nto exclude the others.\r\n\r\nAs bacterial germs are present in the air and readily sow themselves\r\ninto any medium with which they come in contact, the first consideration\r\nis to get good fresh milk which has been as little exposed to the air as\r\npossible. The second is to conduct the experiment where the germs are\r\nfewest, and in cleanly surroundings, far removed from decaying matter\r\nand free from taints and smells.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 38.--Photo-micrograph of smear of\r\n  one-month culture of _Bacillus bulgaricus_. In spite of\r\n  its age, the culture is perfectly free from any foreign\r\n  organisms, which would otherwise lower its value for the\r\n  preparation of soured milk, and might, indeed, make it\r\n  directly injurious.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 39.--Photo-micrograph of culture of\r\n  _Bacillus bulgaricus_ in malt. In cases of acute\r\n  enteritis, where milk cannot be supported, the lactic\r\n  bacilli may be cultivated in malt, and administered to the\r\n  patient in this form, with occasional doses of syrup of\r\n  malt, in order to induce a vigorous growth of the lactic\r\n  ferments in the body.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 40.--Photo-micrograph of smear from\r\n  milk that had been allowed to sour spontaneously. Ordinary\r\n  market milk is always subject to infection from the air,\r\n  milking vessels, manure, etc., and from these sources a\r\n  mixed bacterial flora arises, with the result that the\r\n  milk exhibits curdling, acidity, gaseous fermentation, or\r\n  mould growth, after being stored for a short time. This is\r\n  due to the action of sush bacilli, diplococci, yeasts, and\r\n  moulds as are shown in this illustration.]\r\n\r\nHowever fresh the milk may be, it will contain useless or injurious\r\nbacteria, and we must get rid of these before attempting to introduce\r\nthose whose growth we wish to encourage. This is effected by heat. All\r\nthe living bacteria and most of the germs are killed at temperatures\r\nsomewhat under the boiling point. Having sterilised the milk in this\r\nway, it is necessary, as far as possible, to prevent the entrance of\r\nfresh germs from the atmosphere, and we therefore let the milk cool down\r\nin covered dishes. When the temperature descends to about 100° F. the\r\nculture of the special bacteria is introduced, the covers are replaced,\r\nand the milk vessels maintained at or near this temperature for twelve\r\nhours, when the soured milk is ready for use. It is not necessary to use\r\nfresh culture every time--a little of the soured milk will take its\r\nplace, and this may be repeated as many as fourteen times before it is\r\nnecessary to start off again with a fresh culture. A great deal depends\r\non the care exercised and the freedom of the surroundings from bacterial\r\ngerms. Under the best conditions wild germs will gradually accumulate in\r\nthe soured milk, but their increase may be greatly delayed by attention\r\nto the precautions mentioned. The ordinary souring of milk for butter\r\nand cheese making is conducted in cool surroundings, as already stated,\r\nbecause in such conditions the lactic-acid-producing germs increase\r\nrelatively faster than the wild germs, and so gain the upper hand, but\r\nin the case of our special soured milk we kill out, practically, all\r\nwild bacteria and germs, and the pure culture having the field to\r\nitself, we can conduct the operation at a higher temperature where the\r\naction of the bacteria is at its maximum, and so obtain the necessary\r\nlactification in the minimum of time.\r\n\r\nThe appliances for the souring of milk on the domestic scale require\r\nsome consideration. We propose to describe the principal forms of\r\napparatus which have been put on the market for the purpose, and then to\r\ngive such suggestions as may assist the ingenious in making apparatus\r\nfor themselves. Those who wish for information on the subject of larger\r\napparatus will find it in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 41--Photograph of Agar Culture,\r\n  inoculated with a lactic powder offered to consumers under\r\n  a fancy name. Working on the assumption that the presence\r\n  of lactic bacteria is inimical to the growth of septic\r\n  organisms, this preparation has been placed on the market.\r\n\r\n  The plate shows, however an abundance of colonies of\r\n  foreign organisms--sporogenous bacilli, _Staphylococcus\r\n  pyogenes albus_, and _Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus_.\r\n  These organisms are shown in the appended\r\n  photo-micrographs, and constitute impurities in the\r\n  preparation.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Spore forming bacillus]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Staphylococcus pyogenes albus_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 42--Photograph of Test Tubes of Sterile\r\n  Milk, inoculated with a tablet preparation said to contain\r\n  pure cultures. The darker liquefied portion of the\r\n  tube-contents is due to digestion of the curd by\r\n  proteolytic bacteria, thus indicating impure culture. Pure\r\n  cultures of lactic acid bacteria coagulate the milk\r\n  uniformly, but do not produce any subsequent change in the\r\n  appearance of the culture, even after several months.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 43--Photograph of Test Tubes of\r\n  Sterile Milk, each tube having been inoculated with a\r\n  tablet of a preparation said to contain pure cultures.\r\n  Here, again, there is evident peptonisation of the curd,\r\n  thus indicating infection by proteolytic ferments.\r\n  Cultures from these tubes demonstrated the presence of a\r\n  foreign organism. Microscopical examination failed to\r\n  disclose the presence of _Bacillus Bulgaricus_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 44--Photograph of Test Tubes of\r\n  Sterile Milk, inoculated with a tablet of\r\n  \"Lactobacilline.\" In contra-distinction to those shown in\r\n  Figs. 42 and 43, these tubes exhibit homogeneous curdling\r\n  of the milk without any subsequent digestion or\r\n  peptonisation of the coagulum. This is indicative of the\r\n  purity of the culture.]\r\n\r\nThe Society \"Le Ferment\" of Paris, which has been authorised by\r\nProfessor Metchnikoff to prepare and supply to the public his sour milk\r\nculture, provides an apparatus for the treatment of the milk. It is\r\nshown in Fig. 45, which consists of a double box having the intervening\r\nspace packed with a non-conducting material. It is provided with a\r\ntight lid. Inside, there is accommodation for two milk vessels, each\r\nwith a capacity of about two thirds of a pint. The most difficult thing\r\nin the souring of milk is to maintain the temperature as nearly at 100°\r\nF. as possible while the culture is in action. This result is attained\r\nby filling the vessel in the middle with boiling water. The insulated\r\nwalls hinder the escape of heat, and the quantity of boiling water used\r\nis calculated to maintain the temperature steady for the twelve hours of\r\ncultivation; but in cold, frosty weather it is necessary to refill the\r\ncentral vessel with boiling water in the middle of the period.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 45]\r\n\r\nThe milk jars are washed with hot boiled water and turned upside down to\r\ndry. They should not be wiped with a cloth. Boil the milk to be treated\r\nfor ten minutes, stirring it to promote evaporation, as it is\r\nadvantageous to have it in concentrated form. Cool rapidly to 100° F. by\r\nplacing the boiling vessel in cold water, add to each bowl one third of\r\na tube of the culture in powder form, fill up with the boiled and cooled\r\nmilk, stir well and cover. Place the jars in the box and fill the\r\ncentral vessel with boiling water, shut the lid tight, and do not open\r\nit (unless a fresh charge of boiling water is needed) for ten or twelve\r\nhours, when it will be ready for use. If the liquid culture is used (one\r\nsmall phial for each bowl) the milk should be cooled to 86° F. instead\r\nof 100° F., as with the powder. The culture is also supplied in tabloid\r\nform. The powder and tabloids keep well, but the liquid can only be\r\nrelied on for about two months. The milk prepared as above should be\r\nstored in a cool place, the lids being kept on the bowls. It is good for\r\nabout two days, after which it becomes too sour. It can be eaten with\r\nsugar, which not only sweetens it but is beneficial in affording\r\nadditional suitable food for the acid-producing bacilli. If fresh milk\r\ncannot be had, condensed, sterilised, or pasteurised milk may be used,\r\nbut, of course, fresh milk is best. Condensed milk should be diluted\r\nwith two parts of boiling water and then treated like ordinary milk.\r\n\r\nAn apparatus on similar principles is sold by the Maya Bulgare Company,\r\nLtd., and is illustrated in Fig. 46.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 46--Soured Milk Apparatus of the Maya\r\n  Bulgare Company, Limited, consisting of an insulated box,\r\n  hot-water vessel, and covered vessels containing the milk\r\n  and culture. The apparatus consists of cabinet in deal,\r\n  Maya Bulgare ferment in 20-dose bottles, Maya Bulgare\r\n  ferment in 100-dose bottles, compressed Maya Bulgare\r\n  tablets in boxes of 8 tubes, Maya Bulgare caramels in\r\n  boxes of 40, reduced milk, china funnels, and\r\n  thermometers.]\r\n\r\nThe box is insulated, but the door is on the side, the hot water vessel\r\nis underneath, and the covered vessels containing the milk and culture\r\nare placed on a shelf above. In the front of the illustration are shown\r\nthe various packages in which the liquid and powder cultures are put up.\r\nThe procedure is exactly the same as with \"Le Ferment\" apparatus.\r\n\r\nLactic Ferments, Limited, make use of a different principle to maintain\r\nthe temperature steady during the lactifying period. Their apparatus\r\n(Fig. 47) consists of a water vessel mounted on a stand. The milk\r\nvessels (tumblers) are placed in the water, and the temperature\r\nmaintained at the proper figure by a small night light burning\r\nunderneath. It is recommended that the milk should be placed in an\r\nearthenware jar or jug, which is stood in a pot of water kept boiling\r\nfor an hour. After cooling add from three to six previously crushed\r\ntabloids of culture, and stir well with a glass rod which has been\r\nsterilised in boiling water. The milk is then transferred to three\r\ntumblers, which it should fill, and these are put into the water vessel,\r\nthe water in which should be at about 100° F., and the night light\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 47]\r\n\r\nMessrs. Allen & Hanbury, Limited, also make use of the night light to\r\nmaintain the proper temperature during incubation in their \"Sauerin\"\r\napparatus (Fig. 48).\r\n\r\nNo water, however, is placed in the metal container. The procedure is\r\nthe same as that already described, and both tablet and liquid pure\r\ncultures are supplied. For children it is recommended that the\r\nincubation should occupy from three to four hours only, in other cases\r\neight to ten hours. Grated nutmeg, ground cinnamon, or other flavouring,\r\nand cream may be used with the soured milk.\r\n\r\nThe night light is also employed in the \"Veronelle\" apparatus of Messrs.\r\nClay, Paget and Company, Limited (Fig. 49).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 48.--Messrs. Allen & Hanbury's Soured\r\n  Milk Apparatus. They maintain the temperature by means of\r\n  a night light, and the culture they use they call\r\n  \"Sauerin.\"]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 49.--Vironelle Apparatus for souring\r\n  milk, made by Messrs. Clay, Paget & Company, Limited. The\r\n  milk in this case is placed in an earthenware jar, and is\r\n  sterilised by placing in a saucepan of water and boiling\r\n  it. The culture is added after cooling, the period of\r\n  incubation being about six hours.]\r\n\r\nThe containing vessel is of tin or aluminium, and has two stands, the\r\nhigh one for hot and the low one for cold weather, as in the latter\r\ncase greater heat is needed to maintain the incubating temperature. The\r\nmilk is placed in an earthenware jar and is sterilised by placing it in\r\na saucepan of water and boiling it; continuing the boiling for half an\r\nhour. It is allowed to cool to about 98° F., and placed in the\r\nincubator, culture added, and the lamp lighted, the cover of the\r\nincubator being kept on. The period of incubation is given as six hours.\r\nTo prepare the next day's supply a tablespoonful of the soured milk is\r\nretained and used instead of the culture. This may be continued for\r\nfourteen days, when a fresh start with culture is necessary. The soured\r\nmilk will keep for thirty-six hours. Capacity, one and one half and two\r\npints; also a large size for family use.\r\n\r\nFor the preparation of soured milk on a small scale, one of the various\r\nforms of vacuum flasks now on the market may be used with satisfactory\r\nresults. A little cold water must be poured into the flasks, and warm\r\nwater added, until, by means of three to four changes, boiling water can\r\nbe safely poured in without cracking the flask.\r\n\r\nThis boiling water must be allowed to remain in for about twenty\r\nminutes, and then replaced by freshly boiled milk that has been cooled,\r\nso that its temperature in the flask is about 105° F. The culture of\r\nlactic organisms should then be added, the opening of the flask plugged\r\nwith clean cotton-wool, and the cap screwed on.\r\n\r\nIn an actual test, the temperature of the milk placed in such a flask\r\nwas 105° F., at 7.30 P.M., and had dropped to 93° F. by 9 A.M., the\r\nfollowing day. The milk was curdled, and possessed the normal acid taste\r\nof such cultures.\r\n\r\nThe different types of apparatus are all quite simple, and it would be\r\neasy to make something at home. Get two round tins, the one less in\r\ndiameter by from two to three inches than the other, put one or two\r\npieces of wood across the bottom inside the larger tin, and fill up the\r\nspace between with cotton-wool, which is an excellent non-conductor of\r\nheat. Place the smaller tin centrally inside the larger one. Fix three\r\nor four distance pieces of wood in the space between them, fill up with\r\ncotton-wool, leaving a little space at the top to permit the lid of the\r\nsmaller tin to be fixed on. The boiling-water vessel may be a tin\r\nsaucepan with a lid, but no handle, and its proper place would be on the\r\nbottom of the inner tin. A tripod stand made of three pieces of wire\r\nbound together, and with legs reaching past the hot-water vessel to the\r\nbottom of the tin, would support a false bottom of tin forming the shelf\r\non which the vessels of milk to be treated would rest. These might be\r\ntumblers covered with tin lids. To prevent radiation through the lid of\r\nthe inner tin, a thick pad or hood of cotton-wool packed between cloth\r\nwould be placed over the top. A little experimenting would be necessary\r\nto determine the quantity of boiling water required to maintain the\r\nproper temperature.\r\n\r\nThe soured milk obtained in the above manner is of the consistency of\r\nordinary buttermilk; a separation of whey frequently takes place, and\r\nthis may be poured off if desired. The taste and flavour should be\r\npleasantly acid and agreeable, and both are distinctive enough to give a\r\ngood idea of the purity of the product. In many places a more\r\nconcentrated article is made by boiling down the milk to one half or one\r\nthird of its bulk, and then fermenting it in the ordinary way. A kind of\r\nthick pudding is thus obtained, which is highly recommended both as an\r\nagreeable article of food and as a stronger medium for the support of\r\nthe germs it is the purpose of the sour milk treatment to introduce\r\ninto the digestive system.\r\n\r\nThe cultures for making soured milk can now be had from all the leading\r\nwholesale and retail chemists, with directions as to the quantities to\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\nIt is very necessary that the milk used should be not only fresh and\r\ngood, but also free from chemical preservatives. The effect of these is\r\nto inhibit the growth and development of bacteria, and they have\r\ntherefore an injurious influence on the special lactifying germs it is\r\nour object to cultivate. Preservatives are now not nearly so much used\r\nas they were, a few years ago, and there should be no difficulty in\r\nobtaining milk free from them.\r\n\r\nFor keeping both fresh and soured milk good a small ice-chest is an\r\nexcellent device. The germs which are continually dropping into milk\r\nkept in open vessels in the air, even in cleanly surroundings, are\r\nmostly kept out in the close ice-chest, and the low temperature prevents\r\nin a natural way the development of the bacterial germs already in the\r\nmilk. For the preservation of all kinds of foods the ice-chest is a\r\ncapital investment, not to mention the benefit of having cooled drinks,\r\netc., as required. They manage things well in this respect in the United\r\nStates, where ice is regarded as a necessity in the summer time by even\r\nthe poorest people, and is delivered with the same regularity as the\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to utter a word of warning as to certain forms in which\r\nthe sour milk bacillus is being offered to the public. It is being\r\ncompounded with sugar, chocolate, and other articles, and sold in the\r\nform of sweets, etc. There is no reliable proof that these preparations\r\nare valuable. Certainly, sugar is a medium in which the lactifying germs\r\ncan live, but the quantity so introduced into the system must be very\r\nsmall compared with what is obtained from properly fermented milk. It\r\ntakes some time, even with strong cultures, to fix the acid-producing\r\ngerms in the large bowel where they are wanted, and until proper\r\nevidence is forthcoming that confectionery preparations are efficacious\r\nwe would recommend that only the regularly fermented milk be used. It\r\nwould save trouble, no doubt, to treat oneself with a few chocolate\r\ncreams containing the necessary germs daily, but if the matter is taken\r\nup seriously it will be better to take some pains and stick to methods\r\nthe efficacy of which has been demonstrated, leaving the others until\r\ntheir _bona fides_ has been proved. There are always enterprising firms\r\nwho are prepared to simplify things for us, but we must make sure that\r\ntheir simplifications are warranted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE PREPARATION OF SOURED MILK IN THE DAIRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency in certain medical quarters to discourage the use of\r\nsoured milk \"made for profit.\" This view leaves out of account the fact\r\nthat besides being of value in medicine, the article in question is also\r\nan excellent food, which, as we have seen, has been consumed by\r\nmultitudes of people for ages in many parts of the world. There seems\r\nalso to be satisfactory evidence that a larger percentage than usual of\r\nthe people who make soured milk a staple of diet attain to a ripe old\r\nage. How does it become such a dangerous thing the moment the doctors\r\nget it into their hands? Of course if a man has an acute disease he\r\nplaces himself entirely in the hands of his medical man, and eats what\r\nis prescribed for him, or at least he ought to do so, and if he makes\r\nsuch a submission he is entitled at least to the comfort of being able\r\nto feel that his doctor is free from unreasonable prejudices. For the\r\nimplication that an article \"made for profit\" is naturally suspect casts\r\nan unwarranted stigma on a large number of honourable people. There are\r\ndishonest tradesmen just as there are dishonest and careless doctors,\r\nbut to saddle a whole class with the offences of a few would not be a\r\njustifiable proceeding in either case. Besides, it is not to the\r\ninterest of the manufacturing chemist or the dairyman to turn out\r\nspurious cultures or bad soured milk, and on the whole we see no reason\r\nwhy they should not engage in the business.\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of soured milk in other countries as a regular\r\narticle of diet seems to indicate that all manner of people, except\r\nthose suffering from diseases which necessitate medical regulation of\r\ndiet, might with probable benefit to themselves add this article to\r\ntheir food list; and it looks as if a good many of them intend doing so,\r\neven if scandalised doctors threaten \"to abandon the cure.\"\r\n\r\nThe dairyman who knows his business does not need to be told of the care\r\nwhich is necessary to keep milk in good condition. The merely commercial\r\nconsideration of avoiding loss has made him ready to inquire into the\r\nbest means of prolonging the life of milk as a merchantable article.\r\nFor a time he relied on chemical preservatives, but their day is now\r\nalmost over, and filtration, pasteurisation, and cold storage have taken\r\ntheir place. Any one conversant with the trade knows how widely these\r\nmethods have been adopted of late years; we may, therefore, assume that\r\nthe average dairyman has at his command milk suitable for the incubation\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe demand for soured milk is not as yet a very large one, and the\r\napparatus so far developed for its production is meant for the treatment\r\nof small quantities. After describing the principal appliances at\r\npresent in the market we propose to make some suggestions as to the\r\nconstruction of larger apparatus.\r\n\r\nA firm which has given great attention to the question of maintaining\r\nfixed temperatures is that of Messrs. Charles Hearson & Co., Ltd. Their\r\nincubators for chicken hatching are known all over the world; and their\r\nappliances for biological incubation are very generally used in\r\nbacteriological laboratories. With such experience it was natural that\r\nthey should turn their attention to soured milk apparatus, and the\r\nresult is the \"Lactobator\" (Figs. 50 and 51).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 50.--\"Lactobator\" made by Messrs.\r\n  Charles Hearson & Co., Limited, which is used for the\r\n  incubation of pure culture in milk in a fairly large way.\r\n  The illustration shows the \"Lactobator\" closed.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 51.--Messrs. Hearson & Company's\r\n  \"Lactobator,\" showing the internal arrangements.]\r\n\r\nA copper vessel made to contain water has placed in it a stoneware jar\r\nwhich holds two gallons of milk; on the top is a lid which carries a\r\nthermometer for indicating the temperature of the milk. Heat is supplied\r\nby a gas ring under the copper vessel; and in the gas supply is the\r\npatent thermostat made use of by Messrs. Hearson also in their\r\nbiological and poultry incubators, in which a capsule containing a\r\nliquid arranged to boil at a certain predetermined temperature is the\r\nregulating factor. When the liquid boils, the capsule expands, and by\r\ncertain mechanical devices regulates the gas supply so as to produce\r\nexactly the temperature required.\r\n\r\nThe procedure is as follows: The jar is filled with milk, and water is\r\nrun into the copper vessel by the funnel until it runs over at the\r\noverflow pipe. The thermostat is lifted off and the full gas supply\r\nallowed to pass to the burner, the temperature of the milk brought up to\r\n180° F. and maintained for half an hour at this figure. The gas is then\r\nturned off, and cold water run through the funnel until the temperature\r\nof the milk registers 95° F. The culture is added, the lid replaced, and\r\nthe thermostat put into the pocket at the side of the vessel; the gas\r\nrelighted, and when the temperature reaches 100° to 106° F. the\r\ncapsule of the thermostat will expand and close the gas to a peep, which\r\nis just sufficient to maintain the temperature within the above limits.\r\nAfter eight hours the incubation is completed.\r\n\r\nEdgar's patent apparatus, the \"Lactogenerator,\" as provided by the Dairy\r\nSupply Co., Ltd., is shown in Fig. 52.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 52. Edgar's \"Lactogenerator\"]\r\n\r\nThe milk is placed in a tinned copper-jacketed vessel and water run in\r\nthrough a vertical pipe until it runs off at the overflow. Two gas\r\nconnections are required with cocks on each, the one to heat up the milk\r\nto the boiling point and maintain it at this for thirty minutes. A\r\nskimmer which has been placed in the milk lifts out the coagulated\r\nprotein and albumen which rise to the top. The cock is then shut and\r\ncold water run through the jacket till the thermometer shows 90° F.,\r\nwhen the culture is added, and the other gas supply with the regulator\r\nturned on, and the temperature is automatically maintained at about 90°\r\nF. Time of incubation eight to nine hours. It is recommended to turn\r\ncold water into the jacket at the end of the period to prevent\r\noverincubation.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar apparatus is that of the Willows Refrigerating Co.,\r\nLtd. (Fig. 53), with the exception that it has no automatic heat\r\nregulator. It is made of tinned steel, and the operations are the same,\r\nbut the sterilising temperature (obtained by a gas ring or hot plate) is\r\ngiven as 180°, and the incubating temperature 100° to 104° F. for a\r\nperiod of twelve hours. Presumably this temperature is maintained by a\r\nsmall gas jet or other similar source of heat. The capacity is two\r\ngallons.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 53\r\n\r\n  Apparatus of the Willows Refrigerating Co., Ltd.]\r\n\r\nIn the apparatus hitherto described the milk is sterilised in bulk, and\r\nis filled into bottles or jars after incubation, which is not a\r\ndesirable thing to do, unless the soured milk is for immediate\r\nconsumption, as there is likely to be contamination with injurious germs\r\nfrom the atmosphere. In the domestic apparatus the milk is usually\r\nincubated in covered jars in which it can be kept until required for\r\nuse, and the practice on the larger scale should be the same.\r\n\r\nThe Dairy Outfit Co., Ltd., have recognised this in their \"Lacto\"\r\napparatus (Fig. 54).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 54\r\n\r\n  \"Lacto\" Apparatus of the Dairy\r\n  Outfit Co., Ltd.]\r\n\r\nA cylindrical vessel is set loosely on a stand, beneath which is a lamp\r\ncalculated to maintain the incubating temperature. The milk is placed in\r\nbottles with metal screw tops, and these are put into the cylindrical\r\nvessel; water is run in round them through the side funnel, the vessel\r\nlifted off the stand, and heated to sterilising point on a stove. Cold\r\nwater is then run in through the funnel until the temperature is low\r\nenough for incubation. Culture is added to each bottle and the lids\r\nscrewed on, the vessel lifted on to its stand, and the lamp lighted. The\r\ncover of the apparatus has a thermometer fixed on it.\r\n\r\nOn the large scale the treatment of the milk would take place entirely\r\nin the jars in which it would be sent out, and the sterilisation and\r\nincubation would be conducted in different pieces of apparatus. The\r\nsterilisation would be effected either (1) by direct steaming, or (2) by\r\nhot water heated by steam. Fig. 55 shows the first type of\r\nsterilisation. The tank is of wrought iron or steel with strengthening\r\npieces of angle iron. The door, with pulleys and counterweight for easy\r\nhandling, is fastened steam-tight by hinged bolts. The apparatus is\r\nmounted on a stand at a convenient height for handling the bottles; and\r\nin front is another stand with channel iron rails to take the waggon in\r\nwhich the bottles or jars to be sterilised are packed. When the door is\r\nfast, steam is turned on, and regulated to produce the proper\r\ntemperature by the thermometer fixed in the shell, in which a pressure\r\ngauge is also secured. After sterilising, the door is opened and the\r\nwaggon drawn forward to the outside, allowed to cool, or removed\r\nelsewhere to cool, and allow space for a new charge.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 55.--Sterilising Apparatus for\r\n  sterilising milk on the large scale. The bottles of milk\r\n  are sterilised, and the culture can then be added, and the\r\n  incubation allowed to proceed in an insulated chamber.]\r\n\r\nThe second method of sterilising is by hot water, as in Fig. 56. The\r\nbottles or jars are placed on a perforated false bottom in the\r\nrectangular tank, water run in up to the necks, and steam turned on; the\r\nlid is fastened with hinged and hooked bolts; a thermometer fastened in\r\nthe lid, and with a long stem enclosed in metal, indicates the\r\ntemperature. At the end of the sterilising process cold water is turned\r\non, and at the same time the overflow water cock is opened; the cold\r\nwater gradually reduces the temperature, and the incubating point is\r\nquickly reached.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 56 Another Method of Sterilising\r\n  (Dairy Supply Co., Ltd.).]\r\n\r\nIncubation in bottles or jars, sterilised in these ways, can best be\r\nconducted in an insulated room, with say, six inches of silicate cotton,\r\ngranulated cork, or washed cow hair packed between two-inch by six-inch\r\nbattens, covered with matching on either side, and lined with sheet\r\nzinc. It would be an advantage to have an air-lock or anteroom into\r\nwhich the waggons or trays of sterilised jars could be run, and the door\r\nof the anteroom closed before the door of the insulated room is opened.\r\nThis would tend to prevent variations of temperature in the room, and\r\nalso, by checking free communication with the outside air, decrease\r\ncontamination. The waggons of jars would be run in, and culture added to\r\neach jar by a sterilised pipette. The atmosphere of the room would be\r\nkept pure by running in air frequently through a filter of moist\r\ncotton-wool by means of an electric fan, and at intervals the interior\r\nwould be sterilised by the use of formalin vapour.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Details of an American Apparatus for\r\n  Preparing Soured Milk_\r\n\r\n  FIG. 57\r\n\r\n  The figures give diagrams A, B, C, and D of an apparatus\r\n  useful for the preparation of lactic foods. The incubating\r\n  can A, is made of block tin, and is intended to contain\r\n  the milk. B, the warm water container, should be a stout\r\n  walled vessel with a circular aperture in the lid, through\r\n  which the incubating can may be passed, and clamped down\r\n  as in C.\r\n\r\n  B is fitted with three stout iron legs, which should be\r\n  sufficiently long to allow of a small lamp or gas-jet\r\n  being placed beneath the container to maintain a uniform\r\n  temperature.\r\n\r\n  D gives an external view of the apparatus.\r\n\r\n  For the preparation of soured milk, separated milk is\r\n  placed in the incubating can, and heated up to 100° C.\r\n  (212° F.) for thirty minutes. It is then allowed to cool\r\n  to room temperature, and the culture, or tablet containing\r\n  the lactic acid bacteria, is then added, and thoroughly\r\n  stirred for a minute or so. The can is then immersed in\r\n  the warm water container and kept at a temperature of 86°\r\n  F. to 104° F., according to the organisms used, for ten to\r\n  twelve hours. By the end of this time the milk ought to be\r\n  converted to a jelly-like mass, and after being stirred\r\n  vigorously for a short time, may be cooled on ice, and is\r\n  then ready for consumption.]\r\n\r\nThe incubating temperature could very conveniently be maintained by an\r\nelectric radiator, and as the insulation would largely prevent leakage,\r\nthe amount of electric current used would not be large. The regulating\r\napparatus might consist of a thermometer with platinum wires fused\r\nthrough the stem at the proper temperature, say 100° F. When the mercury\r\nrises to this figure it will complete the circuit of a battery which\r\nwill actuate certain well-known devices for turning off the current\r\nwhich actuates the radiator. In this way a very fine automatic\r\narrangement would be achieved. Steam pipes might be used instead of the\r\nradiator, and the thermometer above described could be used in this case\r\nalso, with appliances to cut off the steam.\r\n\r\nOn the large scale, labour-saving appliances, such as the mechanical\r\nbrush jar and bottle washer, and the automatic filler for jars or\r\nbottles, would be employed, and an overhead trackway for carrying the\r\ntrays of jars from the steriliser to the incubator would be a great\r\nconvenience. A further adjunct of considerable importance would be a\r\ncold room, worked either by ice or a refrigerating machine, in which the\r\njars could be stored after incubation, so as to arrest the process of\r\nlactification, and maintain the soured milk in good condition until\r\nrequired for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSOURED MILK IN HEALTH AND DISEASE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen people are ill the best thing they can do is to place themselves in\r\nthe hands of the doctor, who will try to regulate their lives, including\r\ntheir diet, in accordance with the conditions which science suggests as\r\nthe most likely to lead to their recovery.\r\n\r\nIt is not the aim of this book to teach persons who should be under\r\nmedical treatment to doctor themselves; soured milk may or may not be\r\nbeneficial in their case--that is for the medical man to say; and\r\nfurther, if it should be beneficial the doctor ought to have its\r\npreparation under his control. Slight differences in quality and purity\r\nmay count for much in cases of acute disease, differences which might\r\nnot matter to the person who requires no medical attention, and who\r\nconsumes the article as a health-giving food. A considerable body of\r\nevidence is already on record as to the potency in certain cases of\r\nsoured milk as a curative agent, and it seems to have taken its place in\r\nmedicine as a recognised remedy.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide field of usefulness, however, outside of the strictly\r\nmedical one. Professor Metchnikoff has collected many striking examples\r\nof individuals and peoples inhabiting different parts of the world, who\r\nthrive, and in many cases attain to a great age, and whose diet consists\r\nlargely of soured milk. He has made a wide and general inquiry into the\r\ncauses which tend to shorten life, and makes out a strong case in\r\nsupport of the view that in many cases this is the result of what is\r\ncalled auto-intoxication or self-poisoning. In man and in the mammalia\r\ngenerally, the colon or large intestine is very largely developed; this\r\norgan is not of much value in the digestion of food, and seems to be\r\nchiefly a receptacle for waste material; it is, as a rule, extremely\r\nrich in bacterial flora, which produce putrefactive changes in the waste\r\nmaterial. As a result various poisonous principles are evolved, and\r\nthese find their way into the blood, accompanied frequently, there is\r\nevery reason to believe, by the injurious bacteria themselves. In this\r\nway many diseases and ailments are produced which shorten life. The\r\ninquiry then naturally turns to what is the best way of dealing with\r\nthis state of matters. It is known that the bacteria referred to\r\nflourish best in alkaline or at least non-acid surroundings, and it is\r\nknown that these conditions very frequently exist in the large\r\nintestine. Acids are the best antiseptics; they have been used from time\r\nimmemorial as preservatives; pickles are preserved in vinegar or acetic\r\nacid, and when milk is allowed to sour under proper conditions, the\r\ngerms of putrefaction are destroyed or their activity inhibited, and it\r\nkeeps a considerable time. Doubtless, in hot countries, it was this\r\nproperty of lactic acid which first led to milk being artificially\r\nsoured with a view to its preservation as an article of food. So\r\npowerful is lactic acid in this respect that it is a custom in some\r\ncountries to preserve meat by placing it in soured milk.\r\n\r\nHow can acids be applied so as to control the bacterial flora of the\r\nlarge intestine? Not in the ordinary way, because, when administered\r\nthrough the mouth, they are used up long before they can penetrate to\r\nthe colon. The brilliant idea occurred to Professor Metchnikoff, of\r\nadministering acid-producing germs which might work their way through\r\nthe digestive system, and, reaching the large intestine, produce the\r\nacid required. After much experimenting the bacillus of Massol,\r\n_Bacillus bulgaricus_, was adopted as the most suitable. The Bulgarian\r\nbacillus is an extremely vigorous one, multiplying with great rapidity,\r\nand persisting in conditions that would be inimical to other microbes.\r\nThe growth and development of bacteria is interfered with by the\r\nproducts of their own activity; thus, ordinary lactic-acid-producing\r\norganisms die when a certain amount of lactic acid has been developed;\r\nthe same fate overtakes the Bulgarian bacillus, but it survives longer\r\nand is able to produce as much as two and one half per cent. of lactic\r\nacid in milk before it ceases operations. It seemed therefore the most\r\nlikely to be able to survive the journey through the digestive system.\r\nExperiments fully bore out this supposition, as no great difficulty was\r\nencountered in naturalising the Bulgarian bacillus in the large\r\nintestine, not only in milk cultures, but grown in solution of malt,\r\nbouillon, etc. It thrives in all kinds of sugar, and therefore can be\r\nadministered in a variety of media, very beneficial results following in\r\nmany cases. Direct tests showed a large reduction of the injurious\r\nintestinal flora when the Bulgarian bacillus had been naturalised in\r\nthe colon, and the bacillus persisted long after it had ceased to be\r\nadministered. Specialists who have taken up the subject report the cure\r\nof many ailments through the agency of soured milk, and it seems to have\r\nentered upon a lengthening career of medical usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe fact of so many old people being found in countries where soured\r\nmilk is a staple of diet naturally raises the question as to whether its\r\ngeneral use in other countries might not have a beneficial effect on\r\nhealth and longevity. Its usefulness as a remedial agent in certain\r\ndiseases is already demonstrated; is there not a strong probability,\r\namounting almost to a certainty, that its consumption by people in\r\nhealth would tend to ward off many ailments and prolong life? Of course\r\nthere will be some for whom it is not suitable; there are people who\r\ncannot eat strawberries without discomfort, but no one thinks of\r\nprohibiting the general use of the fruit on that account. In the matter\r\nof diet the person in health, if he exercises ordinary care, may be left\r\nto find out for himself what suits him. The soured milk remedy is not a\r\ndisagreeable one, as, when properly prepared, the article forms both a\r\npleasant and refreshing article of diet. The question of getting the\r\nright article, however, is a very important one. Milk is a splendid\r\nrearing ground for many bacteria, some of which are very injurious;\r\namong these may be pathological germs, the seeds of tuberculosis,\r\nenteritis, etc. The danger with soured milk is, that in the process of\r\nculture we develop the best condition for the increase of these when\r\nthey preponderate, or when, through the use of bad cultures, the\r\nlactic-acid-producing bacteria are absent, or present only in small\r\nnumbers. By the thorough boiling of the milk, we get rid of all living\r\nbacteria and nearly all spores or germs, and by scrupulous cleanliness\r\nin the vessels used--scalding or even boiling them, and allowing them to\r\ndry naturally in an inverted position--we greatly diminish the\r\nprobability of infection with fresh injurious germs from the atmosphere.\r\nAll depends on the purity of the culture employed; this can now be\r\nobtained, prepared in the most careful manner, from wholesale chemists\r\nmaking a speciality of its manufacture.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, even the Bulgarian bacillus is ultimately killed by the\r\nproducts of its own activity, and the natural corollary is, that the\r\nlife of cultures cannot be a long one. Only those cultures should be\r\nbought which are labelled with the date to which they are guaranteed to\r\nmaintain their efficiency. With fresh good milk, careful boiling,\r\nscalding, and cleanliness with regard to the containing vessels, and the\r\nmeans of maintaining the incubating temperature for ten or twelve hours,\r\nthere is not the slightest difficulty in preparing perfectly reliable\r\nsoured milk. There are simple tests which will sufficiently guide the\r\nexperimenter; the soured milk should not be too acid to the taste, and\r\nit has a flavour of its own by which its quality can be recognised. The\r\nlitmus test-papers mentioned in the chapter on the chemistry of milk are\r\nvery useful; both the red and the blue papers should be obtained and\r\nused first of all in testing the quality of the fresh milk. After\r\nincubation the soured milk should turn the blue paper decidedly red; if\r\nthis does not occur, test it with the red paper; if the latter turns\r\nblue it is proof that the wrong fermentation has taken place--that\r\nputrefactive germs have gained the upper hand. The most probable\r\nexplanation is, that the culture is bad, the Bulgarian bacillus is not\r\npresent, or if so, only in small numbers. With these simple tests,\r\ncombined with proper care, one cannot go far wrong. The Eastern nations\r\nwho prepare soured milk in various forms do not exercise the care we\r\nhave predicated, but they seem to make the article of fairly constant\r\nand good quality. It has been suggested in explanation that, as the\r\nordinary flora differs in different countries, the bacterial flora\r\nvaries in a similar manner, and that in these Eastern countries\r\ninjurious bacteria are not so prevalent in the atmosphere as they are\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nIt is also said that the flavour of the soured milk prepared in Bulgaria\r\nis quite different from that prepared in Paris, London, or New York; one\r\nreason probably is that the \"maya\" or ferment used in Bulgaria contains\r\nseveral other organisms besides the Bulgarian bacillus, which raises the\r\nquestion whether a pure culture of one bacillus is the best to use.\r\n\r\nProfessor Metchnikoff found that this bacillus alone had certain\r\ndefects; it attacks fat and is apt to give a tallowy taste when cream is\r\npresent in the milk. He therefore associated with it another\r\nlactic-acid-producing organism, and this combination is the basis of his\r\nculture called \"lactobacilline.\" The presence of yeasts, which occur in\r\nthe Eastern ferments, has been advocated by some; the yeast in\r\nassociation with the lactic organisms produces a small amount of\r\nalcohol. The question of the composition of the culture will have to be\r\nfought out by the experts, but meantime, if we go to the right source,\r\nwe have good enough cultures to go on with.\r\n\r\nA good deal can be said for the use of skimmed or separated milk instead\r\nof whole milk. Cream as a rule contains far more bacteria than the rest\r\nof the milk, and we therefore start from a surer foundation when it is\r\nremoved; besides, the mechanical separator, now so largely used, removes\r\nslime and other impurities from the milk, and these also are hotbeds of\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nSoured milk may be taken at any time, the first thing in the morning,\r\nbefore or after meals, or the last thing at night. The quantity will\r\nvary with the individual, but from half a pint to a pint is a fair\r\namount for daily use. If one wishes to have the maximum effect it is\r\nnecessary for the time being to curtail the use of butcher's meat and\r\nsubstitute fish, yolk of eggs, and other similar foods; not much alcohol\r\nshould be taken, and smoking might be reduced to a minimum. Those who\r\ncannot take even skimmed milk may use whey in which to cultivate the\r\nbacillus; it is not desirable to employ the whey which has been\r\nseparated by the use of rennet, as in cheese- or junket-making. A better\r\narticle is obtained by adding a very small quantity of pure hydrochloric\r\nacid to milk which has been boiled, and then filtering through a sieve,\r\nwhich retains the curd while the liquid whey passes through; a pinch of\r\nsoda is added to neutralise the excess of acid, and, after boiling, the\r\nliquid should turn red litmus paper blue; it is then ready for the\r\naddition of the culture and incubation in the same manner as with milk.\r\nA solution of malt--the extract dissolved in hot water is\r\nconvenient--may also be used instead of milk, and strongly malted bread\r\nor biscuits are excellent to take with the soured milk or cultures in\r\nother mediums, to supply food for the bacillus in the form of malt\r\nsugar. Other sugars, cane or grape, are also very useful, and may be\r\ntaken in the form of fruit juices, syrups, confections, jams, sweet\r\npuddings, etc.\r\n\r\nWe lay stress on the use of soured milk or other cultures of the\r\nBulgarian bacillus by people in health as a probable preventive of\r\ndisease and a possible agent in the lengthening of life, but it may be\r\nof interest to give a short account of its use by medical men in the\r\ntreatment of various ailments. An English authority on the subject, Dr.\r\nHerschell, states that the symptoms of the poisoning of the system by\r\nthe toxic substances produced by injurious bacteria in the large\r\nintestine may include headaches, misery and depression of spirits,\r\ndrowsiness and stupor, giddiness, dimness of sight and dizziness,\r\nfatigue without obvious cause, both of the muscles and brain, fear,\r\npanic, and nervousness, disagreeable sensations in the limbs or face,\r\nsuch as numbness, tingling, or prickling, crawling sensation of weight\r\nor of heat or cold, dyspepsia of the sort where there is a deficiency of\r\nhydrochloric acid and pepsin in the gastric juice, accompanied by\r\nflabbiness and loss of power in the muscles of the stomach, and\r\ncharacterised by flatulence, nausea, loss of appetite, with discomfort\r\nand weight after food, furred tongue, emaciation, earthy colour of the\r\nskin, offensive perspiration and the other signs of biliousness,\r\nenlargement of the liver, and anæmia. These symptoms may have other\r\ncauses, and when one or several of them are present a chemical and\r\nphysical examination of the urine and fæces is necessary to prove that\r\nthey have resulted from auto-intoxication. When this is shown the\r\nsoured milk treatment is indicated, and many striking cures are detailed\r\nas witnesses to its efficacy. The liver and kidneys are the natural\r\nguardians of the body against the toxines we are speaking of, and\r\nfrequently they are over-strained; the soured milk treatment greatly\r\nlightens their load. In malignant disease of the stomach, soured milk\r\nwill frequently be retained when all other foods are rejected. In cases\r\nof neurasthenia and gout it has also proved of value, and in the\r\n\"run-down\" condition which is so common in middle life. Chronic\r\ndiarrhoea and certain forms of constipation have in numerous instances\r\nyielded to the treatment, the whey culture being usually found the most\r\nsuitable. Then, in some forms of anæmia, the lactic acid cultures have\r\nproved most successful, and, as a means of rendering the\r\ngastro-intestinal track aseptic previous to operations, they have proved\r\nof considerable value.\r\n\r\nIf all this has been accomplished in a year or two, what may not we look\r\nforward to in the future when more extended use and experiment shall\r\nhave more fully exhausted the possibilities of the cure? But if we\r\nfollow the example of the different nations who have so long used\r\nsoured milk as a regular article of diet, does it not seem probable that\r\nwe may eliminate some, at least, of the causes of ill-health that call\r\nfor the intervention of the doctor?\r\n\r\nThe human organism is by no means perfect; we have within us many\r\ndefective parts, and some organs whose working seems to be against the\r\nwelfare of the economy. It has now been clearly shown that one of the\r\nchief of these is the large intestine, as to the use of which only vague\r\nand unsatisfactory theories have been formed. There can be no doubt as\r\nto the damage which it frequently inflicts on the system, and, thanks to\r\nthe researches of Professor Metchnikoff and other investigators, we seem\r\nto be in possession of a natural remedy which is sufficient to deal with\r\nthe evils it produces.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] _Discoveries in Nineveh and Babylon_, by Layard, chap.\r\n  xiii.\r\n\r\n  [2] Ex. xviii. and xxiii.; Lev. ii. and xi.\r\n\r\n  [3] _Encyclo.

Dr. Postnikof's plan is the\r\n  following: Half a pound of millet-flour and a quarter of a\r\n  pound of malt are mixed with a sufficient quantity of\r\n  honey to form a paste, which is put into a clean jar,\r\n  covered with a linen cloth, and placed on a warm stove.\r\n  The mass soon begins to rise, and is then taken out,\r\n  wrapped in a piece of muslin, and dropped into a clean\r\n  earthenware vessel, containing about a quart of new mares'\r\n  milk, which is placed in the same temperature that the\r\n  paste was kept in. As soon as signs of fermentation begin\r\n  to show themselves in the fluid, the paste must be\r\n  removed, while the milk, after being stirred, should be\r\n  left in the same temperature till bubbles appear (only in\r\n  very small quantities) on its surface. The ferment is then\r\n  ready.\"\r\n\r\n  [23] _Food and the Principles of Dietetics._\r\n\r\n  [24] _Food and the Principles of Dietetics_, by Robert\r\n  Hutchison, M.D.\r\n\r\n  [25] _Bacteria in Milk and its Products_, by Conn.\r\n\r\n  [26] _Dict.

Illustrated Popular Edition. $1.75 net By mail, $1.90_\r\n\r\n  M. Élie Metchnikoff is one of those rare scientists who have found a\r\n  way to lay hold of and present to the world in untechnical\r\n  phraseology, intelligible to the lay mind, such results of his\r\n  researches as are of universal interest and go straight home to the\r\n  bosoms and business of intelligent men. _The Nature of Man_, by the\r\n  same author, was one of the most fascinating books, at once popular,\r\n  and scientific, which have appeared for decades. The book here in\r\n  question will stand beside it as a worthy companion volume. It is\r\n  satisfactory to report that, absorbed as Metchnikoff is in \"material\"\r\n  problems, and deep as he is in the mysteries of the physical universe,\r\n  these essays show him to be an optimist who speaks with no uncertain\r\n  voice.\r\n\r\n  A great deal of attention is given in _The Prolongation of Human Life_\r\n  to the subject of old age and its causes, with scientific observations\r\n  of special cases among human beings and the lower animals. The author\r\n  suggests means of prolonging life and health, while contemplating\r\n  natural death with serenity, and finding that agreeable sensations\r\n  accompany its approach. Beyond a certain point it seems to him a\r\n  disadvantage to prolong life. Passing on from these mortuary\r\n  lucubrations, the essays concern themselves with psychological\r\n  matters, with optimism and pessimism and in general with questions of\r\n  science and morals. The temperaments of certain great men are analyzed\r\n  in studies that have for their subjects respectively Byron, Leopardi,\r\n  Schopenhauer, and Goethe. In the preface the author says that he has\r\n  avoided, as far as possible, repeating points which have been\r\n  sufficiently treated in _The Nature of Man_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  G. P.
