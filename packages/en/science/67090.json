R. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE INDUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a man named Lessingham dwelt in an old low house in Wastdale,\r\nset in a gray old garden where yew-trees flourished that had seen\r\nVikings in Copeland in their seedling time. Lily and rose and larkspur\r\nbloomed in the borders, and begonias with blossoms big as saucers, red\r\nand white and pink and lemon-colour, in the beds before the porch.\r\nClimbing roses, honeysuckle, clematis, and the scarlet flame-flower\r\nscrambled up the walls. Thick woods were on every side without the\r\ngarden, with a gap north-eastward opening on the desolate lake and the\r\ngreat fells beyond it: Gable rearing his crag-bound head against the\r\nsky from behind the straight clean outline of the Screes.\r\n\r\nCool long shadows stole across the tennis lawn. The air was golden.\r\nDoves murmured in the trees; two chaffinches played on the near post\r\nof the net; a little water-wagtail scurried along the path. A French\r\nwindow stood open to the garden, showing darkly a dining-room panelled\r\nwith old oak, its Jacobean table bright with flowers and silver and cut\r\nglass and Wedgwood dishes heaped with fruit: greengages, peaches, and\r\ngreen muscat grapes. Lessingham lay back in a hammock-chair watching\r\nthrough the blue smoke of an after-dinner cigar the warm light on the\r\nGloire de Dijon roses that clustered about the bedroom window overhead.\r\nHe had her hand in his. This was their House.\r\n\r\n“Should we finish that chapter of Njal?” she said.\r\n\r\nShe took the heavy volume with its faded green cover, and read: “He\r\nwent out on the night of the Lord’s day, when nine weeks were still\r\nto winter; he heard a great crash, so that he thought both heaven and\r\nearth shook. Then he looked into the west airt, and he thought he\r\nsaw thereabouts a ring of fiery hue, and within the ring a man on a\r\ngray horse. He passed quickly by him, and rode hard. He had a flaming\r\nfirebrand in his hand, and he rode so close to him that he could see\r\nhim plainly. He was black as pitch, and he sung this song with a mighty\r\nvoice—\r\n\r\n    Here I ride swift steed,\r\n    His flank flecked with rime,\r\n    Rain from his mane drips,\r\n    Horse mighty for harm;\r\n    Flames flare at each end,\r\n    Gall glows in the midst,\r\n    So fares it with Flosi’s redes\r\n    As this flaming brand flies;\r\n    And so fares it with Flosi’s redes\r\n    As this flaming brand flies.\r\n\r\n“Then he thought he hurled the firebrand east towards the fells before\r\nhim, and such a blaze of fire leapt up to meet it that he could not see\r\nthe fells for the blaze. It seemed as though that man rode east among\r\nthe flames and vanished there.\r\n\r\n“After that he went to his bed, and was senseless for a long time, but\r\nat last he came to himself. He bore in mind all that had happened, and\r\ntold his father, but he bade him tell it to Hjallti Skeggi’s son. So he\r\nwent and told Hjallti, but he said he had seen ‘the Wolf’s Ride, and\r\nthat comes ever before great tidings.’”\r\n\r\nThey were silent awhile; then Lessingham said suddenly, “Do you mind if\r\nwe sleep in the east wing to-night?”\r\n\r\n“What, in the Lotus Room?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I’m too much of a lazy-bones to-night, dear,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“Do you mind if I go alone, then? I shall be back to breakfast. I like\r\nmy lady with me; still, we can go again when next moon wanes. My pet is\r\nnot frightened, is she?”\r\n\r\n“No!” she said, laughing. But her eyes were a little big. Her fingers\r\nplayed with his watch-chain. “I’d rather,” she said presently, “you\r\nwent later on and took me. All this is so odd still: the House, and\r\nthat; and I love it so. And after all, it is a long way and several\r\nyears too, sometimes, in the Lotus Room, even though it is all over\r\nnext morning. I’d rather we went together. If anything happened then,\r\nwell, we’d both be done in, and it wouldn’t matter so much, would it?”\r\n\r\n“Both be what?” said Lessingham. “I’m afraid your language is not all\r\nthat might be wished.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you taught me!” said she; and they laughed.\r\n\r\nThey sat there till the shadows crept over the lawn and up the trees,\r\nand the high rocks of the mountain shoulder beyond burned red in the\r\nevening rays. He said, “If you like to stroll a bit of way up the\r\nfell-side, Mercury is visible to-night. We might get a glimpse of him\r\njust after sunset.”\r\n\r\nA little later, standing on the open hillside below the hawking bats,\r\nthey watched for the dim planet that showed at last low down in the\r\nwest between the sunset and the dark.\r\n\r\nHe said, “It is as if Mercury had a finger on me to-night, Mary. It’s\r\nno good my trying to sleep to-night except in the Lotus Room.”\r\n\r\nHer arm tightened in his. “Mercury?” she said. “It is another world. It\r\nis too far.”\r\n\r\nBut he laughed and said, “Nothing is too far.”\r\n\r\nThey turned back as the shadows deepened. As they stood in the dark of\r\nthe arched gate leading from the open fell into the garden, the soft\r\nclear notes of a spinet sounded from the house. She put up a finger.\r\n“Hark,” she said. “Your daughter playing _Les Barricades_.”\r\n\r\nThey stood listening. “She loves playing,” he whispered. “I’m glad we\r\ntaught her to play.” Presently he whispered again, “_Les Barricades\r\nMystérieuses_. What inspired Couperin with that enchanted name?\r\nAnd only you and I know what it really means. _Les Barricades\r\nMystérieuses._”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThat night Lessingham lay alone in the Lotus Room. Its casements opened\r\neastward on the sleeping woods and the sleeping bare slopes of Illgill\r\nHead. He slept soft and deep; for that was the House of Postmeridian,\r\nand the House of Peace.\r\n\r\nIn the deep and dead time of the night, when the waning moon peered\r\nover the mountain shoulder, he woke suddenly. The silver beams shone\r\nthrough the open window on a form perched at the foot of the bed: a\r\nlittle bird, black, round-headed, short-beaked, with long sharp wings,\r\nand eyes like two stars shining. It spoke and said, “Time is.”\r\n\r\nSo Lessingham got up and muffled himself in a great cloak that lay on\r\na chair beside the bed. He said, “I am ready, my little martlet.” For\r\nthat was the House of Heart’s Desire.\r\n\r\nSurely the martlet’s eyes filled all the room with starlight. It was an\r\nold room with lotuses carved on the panels and on the bed and chairs\r\nand roof-beams; and in the glamour the carved flowers swayed like\r\nwater-lilies in a lazy stream. He went to the window, and the little\r\nmartlet sat on his shoulder. A chariot coloured like the halo about\r\nthe moon waited by the window, poised in air, harnessed to a strange\r\nsteed. A horse it seemed, but winged like an eagle, and its fore-legs\r\nfeathered and armed with eagle’s claws instead of hooves. He entered\r\nthe chariot, and that little martlet sat on his knee.\r\n\r\nWith a whirr of wings the wild courser sprang skyward. The night about\r\nthem was like the tumult of bubbles about a diver’s ears diving in a\r\ndeep pool under a smooth steep rock in a mountain cataract. Time was\r\nswallowed up in speed; the world reeled; and it was but as the space\r\nbetween two deep breaths till that strange courser spread wide his\r\nrainbow wings and slanted down the night over a great island that\r\nslumbered on a slumbering sea, with lesser isles about it: a country of\r\nrock mountains and hill pastures and many waters, all a-glimmer in the\r\nmoonshine.\r\n\r\nThey landed within a gate crowned with golden lions. Lessingham came\r\ndown from the chariot, and the little black martlet circled about his\r\nhead, showing him a yew avenue leading from the gates. As in a dream,\r\nhe followed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      I: THE CASTLE OF LORD JUSS\r\n\r\n  OF THE RARITIES THAT WERE IN THE LOFTY PRESENCE CHAMBER FAIR AND\r\n      LOVELY TO BEHOLD, AND OF THE QUALITIES AND CONDITIONS OF THE\r\n      LORDS OF DEMONLAND: AND OF THE EMBASSY SENT UNTO THEM BY KING\r\n      GORICE XI., AND OF THE ANSWER THERETO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eastern stars were paling to the dawn as Lessingham followed his\r\nconductor along the grass walk between the shadowy ranks of Irish yews,\r\nthat stood like soldiers mysterious and expectant in the darkness.\r\nThe grass was bathed in night-dew, and great white lilies sleeping in\r\nthe shadows of the yews loaded the air of that garden with fragrance.\r\nLessingham felt no touch of the ground beneath his feet, and when he\r\nstretched out his hand to touch a tree his hand passed through branch\r\nand leaves as though they were unsubstantial as a moonbeam.\r\n\r\nThe little martlet, alighting on his shoulder, laughed in his ear.\r\n“Child of earth,” she said, “dost think we are here in dreamland?”\r\n\r\nHe answered nothing, and she said, “This is no dream. Thou, first\r\nof the children of men, art come to Mercury, where thou and I will\r\njourney up and down for a season to show thee the lands and oceans,\r\nthe forests, plains, and ancient mountains, cities and palaces of\r\nthis world, Mercury, and the doings of them that dwell therein. But\r\nhere thou canst not handle aught, neither make the folk ware of thee,\r\nnot though thou shout thy throat hoarse. For thou and I walk here\r\nimpalpable and invisible, as it were two dreams walking.”\r\n\r\nThey were now on the marble steps which led from the yew walk to the\r\nterrace opposite the great gate of the castle. “No need to unbar gates\r\nto thee and me,” said the martlet, as they passed beneath the darkness\r\nof that ancient portal, carved with strange devices, and clean through\r\nthe massy timbers of the bolted gate thickly riveted with silver, into\r\nthe inner court. “Go we into the lofty presence chamber and there\r\ntarry awhile. Morning is kindling the upper air, and folk will soon\r\nbe stirring in the castle, for they lie not long abed when day begins\r\nin Demonland. For be it known to thee, O earth-born, that this land\r\nis Demonland, and this castle the castle of Lord Juss, and this day\r\nnow dawning his birthday, when the Demons hold high festival in Juss’s\r\ncastle to do honour unto him and to his brethren, Spitfire and Goldry\r\nBluszco; and these and their fathers before them bear rule from time\r\nimmemorial in Demonland, and have the lordship over all the Demons.”\r\n\r\nShe spoke, and the first low beams of the sun smote javelin-like\r\nthrough the eastern windows, and the freshness of morning breathed and\r\nshimmered in that lofty chamber, chasing the blue and dusky shades of\r\ndeparted night to the corners and recesses, and to the rafters of the\r\nvaulted roof. Surely no potentate of earth, not Croesus, not the great\r\nKing, not Minos in his royal palace in Crete, not all the Pharaohs, not\r\nQueen Semiramis, nor all the Kings of Babylon and Nineveh had ever a\r\nthrone room to compare in glory with that high presence chamber of the\r\nlords of Demonland. Its walls and pillars were of snow-white marble,\r\nevery vein whereof was set with small gems: rubies, corals, garnets,\r\nand pink topaz. Seven pillars on either side bore up the shadowy vault\r\nof the roof; the roof-tree and the beams were of gold, curiously\r\ncarved, the roof itself of mother-of-pearl. A side aisle ran behind\r\neach row of pillars, and seven paintings on the western side faced\r\nseven spacious windows on the east. At the end of the hall upon a dais\r\nstood three high seats, the arms of each composed of two hippogriffs\r\nwrought in gold, with wings spread, and the legs of the seats the\r\nlegs of the hippogriffs; but the body of each high seat was a single\r\njewel of monstrous size: the left-hand seat a black opal, asparkle\r\nwith steel-blue fire, the next a fire-opal, as it were a burning coal,\r\nthe third seat an alexandrite, purple like wine by night but deep\r\nsea-green by day. Ten more pillars stood in semicircle behind the high\r\nseats, bearing up above them and the dais a canopy of gold. The benches\r\nthat ran from end to end of the lofty chamber were of cedar, inlaid\r\nwith coral and ivory, and so were the tables that stood before the\r\nbenches. The floor of the chamber was tesselated, of marble and green\r\ntourmaline, and on every square of tourmaline was carven the image of a\r\nfish: as the dolphin, the conger, the cat-fish, the salmon, the tunny,\r\nthe squid, and other wonders of the deep. Hangings of tapestry were\r\nbehind the high seats, worked with flowers, snake’s-head, snapdragon,\r\ndragon-mouth, and their kind; and on the dado below the windows were\r\nsculptures of birds and beasts and creeping things.\r\n\r\nBut a great wonder of this chamber, and a marvel to behold, was how\r\nthe capital of every one of the four-and-twenty pillars was hewn from\r\na single precious stone, carved by the hand of some sculptor of long\r\nago into the living form of a monster: here was a harpy with screaming\r\nmouth, so wondrously cut in ochre-tinted jade it was a marvel to hear\r\nno scream from her: here in wine-yellow topaz a flying fire-drake:\r\nthere a cockatrice made of a single ruby: there a star sapphire the\r\ncolour of moonlight, cut for a cyclops, so that the rays of the star\r\ntrembled from his single eye: salamanders, mermaids, chimaeras, wild\r\nmen o’ the woods, leviathans, all hewn from faultless gems, thrice the\r\nbulk of a big man’s body, velvet-dark sapphires, chrysolite, beryl,\r\namethyst, and the yellow zircon that is like transparent gold.\r\n\r\nTo give light to the presence chamber were seven escarbuncles, great as\r\npumpkins, hung in order down the length of it, and nine fair moonstones\r\nstanding in order on silver pedestals between the pillars on the dais.\r\nThese jewels, drinking in the sunshine by day, gave it forth during the\r\nhours of darkness in a radiance of pink light and a soft effulgence as\r\nof moonbeams. And yet another marvel, the nether side of the canopy\r\nover the high seats was encrusted with lapis lazuli, and in that\r\nfeigned dome of heaven burned the twelve signs of the zodiac, every\r\nstar a diamond that shone with its own light.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nFolk now began to be astir in the castle, and there came a score of\r\nserving men into the presence chamber with brooms and brushes, cloths\r\nand leathers, to sweep and garnish it, and burnish the gold and jewels\r\nof the chamber. Lissome they were and sprightly of gait, of fresh\r\ncomplexion and fair-haired. Horns grew on their heads. When their\r\ntasks were accomplished they departed, and the presence began to fill\r\nwith guests. A joy it was to see such a shifting maze of velvets,\r\nfurs, curious needleworks and cloth of tissue, tiffanies, laces,\r\nruffs, goodly chains and carcanets of gold: such glitter of jewels and\r\nweapons: such nodding of the plumes the Demons wore in their hair,\r\nhalf veiling the horns that grew upon their heads. Some were sitting\r\non the benches or leaning on the polished tables, some walking forth\r\nand back upon the shining floor. Here and there were women among them,\r\nwomen so fair one had said: it is surely white-armed Helen this one;\r\nthis, Arcadian Atalanta; this, Phryne that stood to Praxiteles for\r\nAphrodite’s picture; this, Thaïs, for whom great Alexander to pleasure\r\nher fantasy did burn Persepolis like a candle; this, she that was rapt\r\nby the Dark God from the flowering fields of Enna, to be Queen for ever\r\namong the dead that be departed.\r\n\r\nNow came a stir near the stately doorway, and Lessingham beheld a Demon\r\nof burly frame and noble port, richly attired. His face was ruddy and\r\nsomewhat freckled, his forehead wide, his eyes calm and blue like\r\nthe sea. His beard, thick and tawny, was parted and brushed back and\r\nupwards on either side.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, my little martlet,” said Lessingham, “is this Lord Juss?”\r\n\r\n“This is not Lord Juss,” answered the martlet, “nor aught so worshipful\r\nas he. The lord thou seest is Volle, who dwelleth under Kartadza, by\r\nthe salt sea. A great sea-captain is he, and one that did service to\r\nthe cause of Demonland, and of the whole world besides, in the late\r\nwars against the Ghouls.\r\n\r\n“But cast thine eyes again towards the door, where one standeth amid\r\na knot of friends, tall and somewhat stooping, in a corselet of\r\nsilver, and a cloak of old brocaded silk coloured like tarnished gold;\r\nsomething like to Volle in feature, but swarthy, and with bristling\r\nblack moustachios.”\r\n\r\n“I see him,” said Lessingham. “This then is Lord Juss!”\r\n\r\n“Not so,” said the martlet. “’Tis but Vizz, brother to Volle. He is\r\nwealthiest in goods of all the Demons, save the three brethren only and\r\nLord Brandoch Daha.”\r\n\r\n“And who is this?” asked Lessingham, pointing to one of light and brisk\r\nstep and humorous eye, who in that moment met Volle and engaged him in\r\nconverse apart. Handsome of face he was, albeit somewhat long-nosed and\r\nsharp-nosed: keen and hard and filled with life and the joy of it.\r\n\r\n“Here thou beholdest,” answered she, “Lord Zigg, the far-famed tamer of\r\nhorses. Well loved is he among the Demons, for he is merry of mood, and\r\na mighty man of his hands withal when he leadeth his horsemen against\r\nthe enemy.”\r\n\r\nVolle threw up his beard and laughed a great laugh at some jest that\r\nZigg whispered in his ear, and Lessingham leaned forward into the hall\r\nif haply he might catch what was said. The hum of talk drowned the\r\nwords, but leaning forward Lessingham saw where the arras curtains\r\nbehind the dais parted for a moment, and one of princely bearing\r\nadvanced past the high seats down the body of the hall. His gait\r\nwas delicate, as of some lithe beast of prey newly wakened out of\r\nslumber, and he greeted with lazy grace the many friends who hailed his\r\nentrance. Very tall was that lord, and slender of build, like a girl.\r\nHis tunic was of silk coloured like the wild rose, and embroidered in\r\ngold with representations of flowers and thunderbolts. Jewels glittered\r\non his left hand and on the golden bracelets on his arms, and on the\r\nfillet twined among the golden curls of his hair, set with plumes of\r\nthe king-bird of Paradise. His horns were dyed with saffron, and inlaid\r\nwith filigree work of gold. His buskins were laced with gold, and\r\nfrom his belt hung a sword, narrow of blade and keen, the hilt rough\r\nwith beryls and black diamonds. Strangely light and delicate was his\r\nframe and seeming, yet with a sense of slumbering power beneath, as\r\nthe delicate peak of a snow mountain seen afar in the low red rays of\r\nmorning. His face was beautiful to look upon, and softly coloured like\r\na girl’s face, and his expression one of gentle melancholy, mixed with\r\nsome disdain; but fiery glints awoke at intervals in his eyes, and the\r\nlines of swift determination hovered round the mouth below his curled\r\nmoustachios.\r\n\r\n“At last,” murmured Lessingham, “at last, Lord Juss!”\r\n\r\n“Little art thou to blame,” said the martlet, “for this misprision, for\r\nscarce could a lordlier sight have joyed thine eyes. Yet is this not\r\nJuss, but Lord Brandoch Daha, to whom all Demonland west of Shalgreth\r\nand Stropardon oweth allegiance: the rich vineyards of Krothering, the\r\nbroad pasture lands of Failze, and all the western islands and their\r\ncragbound fastnesses. Think not, because he affecteth silks and jewels\r\nlike a queen, and carrieth himself light and dainty as a silver birch\r\ntree on the mountain, that his hand is light or his courage doubtful\r\nin war. For years was he held for the third best man-at-arms in all\r\nMercury, along with these, Goldry Bluszco and Gorice X. of Witchland.\r\nAnd Gorice he slew, nine summers back, in single combat, when the\r\nWitches harried in Goblinland and Brandoch Daha led five hundred and\r\nfour-score Demons to succour Gaslark, the king of that country. And now\r\ncan none surpass Lord Brandoch Daha in feats of arms, save perchance\r\nGoldry alone.\r\n\r\n“Yet, lo,” she said, as a sweet and wild music stole on the ear, and\r\nthe guests turned towards the dais, and the hangings parted, “at\r\nlast, the triple lordship of Demonland! Strike softly, music: smile,\r\nFates, on this festal day! Joy and safe days shine for this world and\r\nDemonland! Turn thy gaze first on him who walks in majesty in the\r\nmidst, his tunic of olive-green velvet ornamented with devices of\r\nhidden meaning in thread of gold and beads of chrysolite. Mark how the\r\nbuskins, clasping his stalwart calves, glitter with gold and amber.\r\nMark the dusky cloak streamed with gold and lined with blood-red silk:\r\na charmed cloak, made by the sylphs in forgotten days, bringing good\r\nhap to the wearer, so he be true of heart and no dastard. Mark him that\r\nweareth it, his sweet dark countenance, the violet fire in his eyes,\r\nthe sombre warmth of his smile, like autumn woods in late sunshine.\r\nThis is Lord Juss, lord of this age-remembering castle, than whom\r\nnone hath more worship in wide Demonland. Somewhat he knoweth of art\r\nmagical, yet useth not that art; for it sappeth the life and strength,\r\nnor is it held worthy that a Demon should put trust in that art, but\r\nrather in his own might and main.\r\n\r\n“Now turn thine eyes to him that leaneth on Juss’s left arm, shorter\r\nbut mayhap sturdier than he, apparelled in black silk that shimmers\r\nwith gold as he moveth, and crowned with black eagle’s feathers\r\namong his horns and yellow hair. His face is wild and keen like a\r\nsea-eagle’s, and from his bristling brows the eyes dart glances\r\nsharp as a glancing spear. A faint flame, pallid like the fire of a\r\nWill-o’-the-Wisp, breathes ever and anon from his distended nostrils.\r\nThis is Lord Spitfire, impetuous in war.\r\n\r\n“Last, behold on Juss’s right hand, yon lord that bulks mighty as\r\nHercules yet steppeth lightly as a heifer. The thews and sinews of\r\nhis great limbs ripple as he moves beneath a skin whiter than ivory;\r\nhis cloak of cloth of gold is heavy with jewels, his tunic of black\r\nsendaline hath great hearts worked thereon in rubies and red silk\r\nthread. Slung from his shoulders clanks a two-handed sword, the pommel\r\na huge star-ruby carven in the image of a heart, for the heart is his\r\nsign and symbol. This is that sword forged by the elves, wherewith he\r\nslew the sea-monster, as thou mayest see in the painting on the wall.\r\nNoble is he of countenance, most like to his brother Juss, but darker\r\nbrown of hair and ruddier of hue and bigger of cheekbone. Look well on\r\nhim, for never shall thine eyes behold a greater champion than the Lord\r\nGoldry Bluszco, captain of the hosts of Demonland.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow when the greetings were done and the strains of the lutes and\r\nrecorders sighed and lost themselves in the shadowy vault of the roof,\r\nthe cup-bearers did fill great gems made in form of cups with ancient\r\nwine, and the Demons caroused to Lord Juss deep draughts in honour of\r\nthis day of his nativity. And now they were ready to set forth by twos\r\nand threes into the parks and pleasaunces, some to take their pleasure\r\nabout the fair gardens and fishponds, some to hunt wild game among the\r\nwooded hills, some to disport themselves at quoits or tennis or riding\r\nat the ring or martial exercises; that so they might spend the livelong\r\nday as befitteth high holiday, in pleasure and action without care, and\r\nthereafter revel in the lofty presence chamber till night grew old with\r\neating and drinking and all delight.\r\n\r\nBut as they were upon going forth, a trumpet was sounded without, three\r\nstrident blasts.\r\n\r\n“What kill-joy have we here?” said Spitfire. “The trumpet soundeth only\r\nfor travellers from the outlands. I feel it in my bones some rascal is\r\ncome to Galing, one that bringeth ill hap in his pocket and a shadow\r\nathwart the sun on this our day of festival.”\r\n\r\n“Speak no word of ill omen,” answered Juss. “Whosoe’er it be, we will\r\nstraight dispatch his business and so fall to pleasure indeed. Some,\r\nrun to the gate and bring him in.”\r\n\r\nThe serving man hastened and returned, saying, “Lord, it is an\r\nAmbassador from Witchland and his train. Their ship made land at\r\nLookinghaven-ness at nightfall. They slept on board, and your soldiers\r\ngave them escort to Galing at break of day. He craveth present\r\naudience.”\r\n\r\n“From Witchland, ha?” said Juss. “Such smokes use ever to go before the\r\nfire.”\r\n\r\n“Shall’s bid the fellow,” said Spitfire, “wait on our pleasure? It is\r\npity such should poison our gladness.”\r\n\r\nGoldry laughed and said, “Whom hath he sent us? Laxus, think you?\r\nto make his peace with us again for that vile part of his practised\r\nagainst us off Kartadza, detestably falsifying his word he had given\r\nus?”\r\n\r\nJuss said to the serving man, “Thou sawest the Ambassador. Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“Lord,” answered he, “His face was strange to me. He is little of\r\nstature and, by your highness’ leave, the most unlike to a great\r\nlord of Witchland that ever I saw. And, by your leave, for all the\r\nmarvellous rich and sumptuous coat a weareth, he is very like a false\r\njewel in a rich casing.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Juss, “a sour draught sweetens not in the waiting. Call we\r\nin the Ambassador.”\r\n\r\nLord Juss sat in the high seat midmost of the dais, with Goldry on his\r\nright in the seat of black opal, and on his left Spitfire, throned\r\non the alexandrite. On the dais sat likewise those other lords of\r\nDemonland, and the guests of lower degree thronged the benches and the\r\npolished tables as the wide doors opened on their silver hinges, and\r\nthe Ambassador with pomp and ceremony paced up the shining floor of\r\nmarble and green tourmaline.\r\n\r\n“Why, what a beastly fellow is this?” said Lord Goldry in his brother’s\r\near. “His hairy hands reach down to his knees. A shuffleth in his walk\r\nlike a hobbled jackass.”\r\n\r\n“I like not the dirty face of the Ambassador,” said Lord Zigg. “His\r\nnose sitteth flat on the face of him as it were a dab of clay, and I\r\ncan see pat up his nostrils a summer day’s journey into his head. If’s\r\nupper lip bespeak him not a rare spouter of rank fustian, perdition\r\ncatch me. Were it a finger’s breadth longer, a might tuck it into his\r\ncollar to keep his chin warm of a winter’s night.”\r\n\r\n“I like not the smell of the Ambassador,” said Lord Brandoch Daha. And\r\nhe called for censers and sprinklers of lavender and rose water to\r\npurify the chamber, and let open the crystal windows that the breezes\r\nof heaven might enter and make all sweet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LORDS JUSS, GOLDRY BLUSZCO, SPITFIRE, AND BRANDOCH\r\n  DAHA.]\r\n\r\nSo the Ambassador walked up the shining floor and stood before the\r\nlords of Demonland that sat upon the high seats between the golden\r\nhippogriffs. He was robed in a long mantle of scarlet velvet lined\r\nwith ermine, with crabs, woodlice, and centipedes worked thereon in\r\ngolden thread. His head was covered with a black velvet cap with a\r\npeacock’s feather fastened with a brooch of silver. Supported by his\r\ntrain-bearers and attendants, and leaning on his golden staff, he with\r\nraucous accent delivered his mission:\r\n\r\n“Juss, Goldry, and Spitfire, and ye other Demons, I come before you\r\nas the Ambassador of Gorice XI., most glorious King of Witchland,\r\nLord and great Duke of Buteny and Estremerine, Commander of Shulan,\r\nThramnë, Mingos, and Permio, and High Warden of the Esamocian Marches,\r\nGreat Duke of Trace, King Paramount of Beshtria and Nevria and Prince\r\nof Ar, Great Lord over the country of Ojedia, Maltraëny, and of\r\nBaltary and Toribia, and Lord of many other countries, most glorious\r\nand most great, whose power and glory is over all the world and whose\r\nname shall endure for all generations. And first I bid you be bound\r\nby that reverence for my sacred office of envoy from the King, which\r\nis accorded by all people and potentates, save such as be utterly\r\nbarbarous, to ambassadors and envoys.”\r\n\r\n“Speak and fear not,” answered Juss. “Thou hast mine oath. And that\r\nhath never been forsworn, to Witch or other barbarian.”\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador shot out his lips in an O, and threatened with his head;\r\nthen grinned, laying bare his sharp and misshapen teeth, and proceeded:\r\n\r\n“Thus saith King Gorice, great and glorious, and he chargeth me to\r\ndeliver it to you, neither adding any word nor taking away: ‘I have it\r\nin mind that no ceremony of homage or fealty hath been performed before\r\nme by the dwellers in my province of Demonland——’”\r\n\r\nAs the rustling of dry leaves strewn in a flagged court when a sudden\r\nwind striketh them, there went a stir among the guests. Nor might the\r\nLord Spitfire contain his wrath, but springing up and clapping hand to\r\nsword-hilt, as minded to do a hurt to the Ambassador, “Province?” he\r\ncried. “Are not the Demons a free people? And is it to be endured that\r\nWitchland should commission this slave to cast insults in our teeth,\r\nand this in our own castle?”\r\n\r\nA murmur went about the hall, and here and there folk rose from their\r\nseats. The Ambassador drew down his head between his shoulders like a\r\ntortoise, baring his teeth and blinking with his small eyes. But Lord\r\nBrandoch Daha, lightly laying his hand on Spitfire’s arm, said: “The\r\nAmbassador hath not ended his message, cousin, and thou hast frightened\r\nhim. Have patience and spoil not the comedy. We shall not lack words to\r\nanswer King Gorice: no, nor swords, if he must have them. But it shall\r\nnot be said of us of Demonland that it needeth but a boorish message to\r\nturn us from our ancient courtesy toward ambassadors and heralds.”\r\n\r\nSo spake Lord Brandoch Daha, in lazy half-mocking tone, as one who but\r\nidly returneth the ball of conversation; yet clearly, so that all might\r\nhear. And therewith the murmurs died down, and Spitfire said, “I am\r\ntame. Say thine errand freely, and imagine not that we shall hold thee\r\nanswerable for aught thou sayest, but him that sent thee.”\r\n\r\n“Whose humble mouthpiece I only am,” said the Ambassador, somewhat\r\ngathering courage; “and who, saving your reverence, lacketh not the\r\nwill nor the power to take revenge for any outrage done upon his\r\nservants. Thus saith the King: ‘I therefore summon and command you,\r\nJuss, Spitfire, and Goldry Bluszco, to make haste and come to me in\r\nWitchland in my fortress of Carcë, and there dutifully kiss my toe, in\r\nwitness before all the world that I am your Lord and King, and rightful\r\noverlord of all Demonland.’”\r\n\r\nGravely and without gesture Lord Juss harkened to the Ambassador,\r\nleaning back in his high seat with either arm thrown athwart the arched\r\nneck of a hippogriff. Goldry, smiling scornfully, toyed with the hilt\r\nof his great sword. Spitfire sat strained and glowering, the sparks\r\ncrackling at his nostrils.\r\n\r\n“Thou hast delivered all?” said Juss.\r\n\r\n“All,” answered the Ambassador.\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt have thine answer,” said Juss. “While we take rede thereon,\r\neat and drink;” and he beckoned the cup-bearer to pour out bright wine\r\nfor the Ambassador. But the Ambassador excused himself, saying that he\r\nwas not athirst, and that he had store of food and wine aboard of his\r\nship, which should suffice his needs and those of his following.\r\n\r\nThen said Lord Spitfire, “No marvel though the spawn of Witchland fear\r\nvenom in the cup. They who work commonly such villany against their\r\nenemies, as witness Recedor of Goblinland whom Corsus murthered with\r\na poisonous draught, shake still in the knees lest themselves be so\r\nentertained to their destruction;” and snatching the cup he quaffed it\r\nto the dregs, and dashed it on the marble floor before the Ambassador,\r\nso that it was shivered into pieces.\r\n\r\nAnd the lords of Demonland rose up and withdrew behind the flowery\r\nhangings into a chamber apart, to determine of their answer to the\r\nmessage sent unto them by King Gorice of Witchland.\r\n\r\nWhen they were private together, Spitfire spake and said, “Is it to be\r\nborne that the King should put such shame and mockery upon us? Could a\r\nnot at the least have made a son of Corund or of Corsus his Ambassador\r\nto bring us his defiance, ’stead of this filthiest of his domestics, a\r\ngibbering dwarf fit only to make them gab and game at their tippling\r\nbouts when they be three parts senseless with boosing?”\r\n\r\nLord Juss smiled somewhat scornfully. “With wisdom,” he said, “and with\r\nforesight hath Witchland made choice of his time to move against us,\r\nknowing that thirty and three of our well-built ships are sunken in\r\nKartadza Sound in the battle with the Ghouls, and but fourteen remain\r\nto us. Now that the Ghouls are slain, every soul, and utterly abolished\r\nfrom this world, and so the great curse and peril of all this world\r\nended by the sword and great valour of Demonland alone, now seemeth the\r\nhappy moment unto these late mouth-friends to fall upon us. For have\r\nnot the Witches a strong fleet of ships, since their whole fleet fled\r\nat the beginning of their fight with us against the Ghouls, leaving us\r\nto bear the burden? And now are they minded for this new treason, to\r\nset upon us traitorously and suddenly in this disadvantage. For the\r\nKing well judgeth we can carry no army to Witchland nor do aught in\r\nhis despite, but must be long months a-shipbuilding. And doubt not he\r\nholdeth an armament ready aboard at Tenemos to sail hither if he get\r\nthe answer he knoweth we shall send him.”\r\n\r\n“Sit we at ease then,” said Goldry, “sharpening our swords; and let\r\nhim ship his armies across the salt sea. Not a Witch shall land in\r\nDemonland but shall leave here his blood and bones to make fat our\r\ncornfields and our vineyards.”\r\n\r\n“Rather,” said Spitfire, “apprehend this rascal, and put to sea to-day\r\nwith the fourteen ships left us. We can surprise Witchland in his\r\nstrong place of Carcë, sack it, and give him to the crows to peck at,\r\nor ever he is well awake to the swiftness of our answer. That is my\r\ncounsel.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Juss, “we shall not take him sleeping. Be certain that his\r\nships are ready and watching in the Witchland seas, prepared against\r\nany rash onset. It were folly to set our neck in the noose; and little\r\nglory to Demonland to await his coming. This, then, is my rede: I will\r\nbid Gorice to the duello, and make offer to him to let lie on the\r\nfortune thereof the decision of this quarrel.”\r\n\r\n“A good rede, if it might be fulfilled,” said Goldry. “But never will\r\nhe dare to stand with weapons in single combat ’gainst thee or ’gainst\r\nany of us. Nevertheless the thing shall be brought about. Is not Gorice\r\na mighty wrastler, and hath he not in his palace in Carcë the skulls\r\nand bones of ninety and nine great champions whom he hath vanquished\r\nand slain in that exercise? Puffed up beyond measure is he in his own\r\nconceit, and folk say it is a grief to him that none hath been found\r\nthis long while that durst wrastle with him, and wofully he pineth for\r\nthe hundredth. He shall wrastle a fall with me!”\r\n\r\nNow this seemed good to them all. So when they had talked on it awhile\r\nand concluded what they would do, glad of heart the lords of Demonland\r\nturned them back to the lofty presence chamber. And there Lord Juss\r\nspake and said: “Demons, ye have heard the words which the King of\r\nWitchland in the overweening pride and shamelessness of his heart hath\r\nspoken unto us by the mouth of this Ambassador. Now this is our answer\r\nwhich my brother shall give, the Lord Goldry Bluszco; and we charge\r\nthee, O Ambassador, to deliver it truly, neither adding any word nor\r\ntaking away.”\r\n\r\nAnd the Lord Goldry spake: “We, the lords of Demonland, do utterly\r\nscorn thee, Gorice XI., for the greatest of dastards, in that thou\r\nbasely fleddest and forsookest us, thy sworn confederates, in the sea\r\nbattle against the Ghouls. Our swords, which in that battle ended so\r\ngreat a curse and peril to all this world, are not bent nor broken.\r\nThey shall be sheathed in the bowels of thee and thy minions, Corsus\r\nto wit, and Corund, and their sons, and Corinius, and what other\r\nevildoers harbour in waterish Witchland, sooner than one little\r\nsea-pink growing on the cliffs of Demonland shall do thee obeisance.\r\nBut, that thou mayest, if so thou wilt, feel our power somewhat, I,\r\nLord Goldry Bluszco, make thee this offer: that thou and I do match\r\nourselves singly each against other to wrastle three falls at the court\r\nof the Red Foliot, who inclineth neither to our side nor to thine in\r\nthis quarrel. And we will bind ourselves by mighty oaths to these\r\nconditions, that if I overcome thee, the Demons shall leave you of\r\nWitchland in peace, and ye them, and the Witches shall forswear for\r\never their impudent claims on Demonland. But if thou, Gorice, win the\r\nday, then hast thou the glory of that victory, and withal full liberty\r\nto thrust thy claims upon us with the sword.”\r\n\r\nSo spake the Lord Goldry Bluszco, standing in great pride and splendour\r\nbeneath the starry canopy, and scowling terribly on the Ambassador\r\nfrom Witchland, so that the Ambassador was abashed and his knees smote\r\ntogether. And Goldry called his scribe and made him write the message\r\nfor Gorice the King in great characters on a roll of parchment, and\r\nthe lords of Demonland sealed it with their seals, and gave it to the\r\nAmbassador.\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador took it and made haste to depart; but when he was come\r\nto the stately doorway of the presence chamber, being near the door\r\nand amongst his attendants, and away from the lords of Demonland, he\r\nplucked up heart a little and turned and said: “Rashly and to thy\r\ncertain undoing, O Goldry Bluszco, hast thou bidden our Lord the King\r\nto contend with thee in wrastling. For be thou never so mighty of limb,\r\nyet hath he overthrown as mighty. And he wrastleth not for sport, but\r\nwill surely work thy life’s decay, and keep the dead bones of thee with\r\nthe bones of the ninety and nine champions whom he hath heretofore laid\r\nlow in that exercise.”\r\n\r\nTherewith, because Goldry and the other lords scowled upon him\r\nterribly, and the guests near the door fell to hooting and reviling of\r\nthe Witches, the Ambassador went forth hastily and hastily down the\r\nshining stairs and across the court, as one who fleeth along a lane\r\non a dark and windy night, daring not to turn his head lest his eye\r\nbehold some fearsome thing prepared to clasp him. So speeding, he was\r\nfain to catch up about his knees the folds of his velvet cloak richly\r\nworked with crabs and creeping things; and huge whooping and laughter\r\nwent up among the common lag of people without, to behold his long and\r\nnerveless tail thus bared to their unfriendly gaze. Insomuch that they\r\nfell to shouting with one accord, “Though his mouth be foul he hath a\r\nfair tail! Saw ye not his tail? Hurrah for Gorice who hath sent us a\r\nmonkey for his Ambassador!”\r\n\r\nAnd with jibe and unmannerly yell the crowd hung lovingly upon the\r\nAmbassador and his train all the way down from Galing castle to the\r\nquays. So that it was like a sweet home-coming to him to come on board\r\nhis well-built ship and have her rowed amain out of Lookinghaven. So\r\nwhen they had rounded Lookinghaven-ness and were free of the land, they\r\nhoisted sail and voyaged before a favouring breeze eastward over the\r\nteeming deep to Witchland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    II: THE WRASTLING FOR DEMONLAND\r\n\r\n  OF THE PROGNOSTICKS WHICH TROUBLED LORD GRO CONCERNING THE MEETING\r\n      BETWEEN THE KING OF WITCHLAND AND THE LORD GOLDRY BLUSZCO; AND\r\n      HOW THEY MET, AND OF THE ISSUE OF THAT WRASTLING.\r\n\r\n\r\n“How could I have fallen asleep?” cried Lessingham. “Where is the\r\ncastle of the Demons, and how did we leave the great presence chamber\r\nwhere they saw the Ambassador?” For he stood on rolling uplands that\r\nleaned to the sea, treeless on every side as far as the eye might\r\nreach; and on three sides shimmered the sea, kissed by the sun and\r\nroughened by the salt glad wind that charged over the downs, charioting\r\nclouds without number through the illimitable heights of air.\r\n\r\nThe little black martlet answered him, “My hippogriff travelleth as\r\nwell in time as in space. Days and weeks have been left behind by us,\r\nin what seemeth to thee but the twinkling of an eye, and thou standest\r\nin the Foliot Isles, a land happy under the mild regiment of a peaceful\r\nprince, on the day appointed by King Gorice to wrastle with Lord Goldry\r\nBluszco. Terrible must be the wrastling betwixt two such champions,\r\nand dark the issue thereof. And my heart is afraid for Goldry Bluszco,\r\nbig and strong though he be and unconquered in war; for there hath not\r\narisen in all the ages such a wrastler as this Gorice, and strong he\r\nis, and hard and unwearying, and skilled in every art of attack and\r\ndefence, and subtle withal, and cruel and fell like a serpent.”\r\n\r\nWhere they stood the down was cut by a combe that descended to the sea,\r\nand overhanging the combe was the palace of the Red Foliot, rambling\r\nand low, with many little towers and battlements, built of stones\r\nhewn from the wall of the combe, so that it was hard from a distance\r\nto discern what was palace and what native rock. Behind the palace\r\nstretched a meadow, flat and smooth, carpeted with the close wiry turf\r\nof the downs. At either end of the meadow were booths set up, to the\r\nnorth the booths of them of Witchland, and to the south the booths of\r\nthe Demons. In the midst of the meadow was a space marked out with\r\nwithies sixty paces either way for the wrastling ground.\r\n\r\nOnly the birds of the air and the sea-wind were abroad as then, save\r\nthose that walked armed before the Witches’ booths, six in company,\r\nharnessed as for battle in byrnies of shining bronze, with greaves\r\nand shields of bronze and helms that glanced in the sun. Five were\r\nproper slender youths, the eldest of whom had not yet beard full grown,\r\nblack-browed and great of jaw; the sixth, huge as a neat, topped them\r\nby half a head. Age had flecked with gray the beard that spread over\r\nhis big chest to his belt stiffened with studs of iron, but the vigour\r\nof youth was in his glance and in his voice, and in the tread of his\r\nfoot, and in his fist so lightly handling his burly spear.\r\n\r\n“Behold, wonder, and lament,” said the martlet, “that the innocent eye\r\nof day should be enforced still to look upon the children of night\r\neverlasting. Corund of Witchland and his cursed sons.”\r\n\r\nLessingham thought, “A most fiery politician is my little martlet:\r\ndamned fiends and angels and nothing betwixt for her. But I’ll dance to\r\nnone of their tunes, but wait for these things’ unfolding.”\r\n\r\nSo walked those back and forth as caged lions before the Witches’\r\nbooths, until Corund halted and leaning on his spear said to one of his\r\nsons, “Go in and seek out Gro that I may speak with him.” And the son\r\nof Corund went, and returned anon with Lord Gro, that came with furtive\r\nstep, yet goodly and fair to behold. The nose of him was hooked like a\r\nsickle and his eyes great and fair like the eyes of an ox, inscrutable\r\nas they. Lean and spare was his frame. Pale was his face and pale his\r\ndelicate hands, and his long black beard was tightly curled and bright\r\nas the coat of a black retriever.\r\n\r\nCorund said, “How is it with the King?”\r\n\r\nGro answered him, “He chafeth to be at it; and to pass away the time he\r\nplayeth at dice with Corinius, and the luck goeth against the King.”\r\n\r\n“What makest thou of that?” asked Corund.\r\n\r\nAnd Gro said, “The fortune of the dice jumpeth not commonly with the\r\nfortune of war.”\r\n\r\nCorund grunted in his beard, and laying his large hand on Lord Gro’s\r\nshoulder, “Speak to me a little apart,” he said; and when they were\r\nprivate, “Darken not counsel,” said Corund, “to me and my sons. Have I\r\nnot these four years past been as a brother unto thee, and wilt thou\r\nstill be secret toward us?”\r\n\r\nBut Gro smiled a sad smile and said, “Why should we by words of ill\r\nomen strike yet another blow where the tree tottereth?”\r\n\r\nCorund groaned. “Omens,” said he, “increase upon us from that time\r\nforth when the King accepted the challenge, evilly, and flatly against\r\nthy counsel and mine and the counsel of all the great ones in the land.\r\nSurely the Gods have made him fey, having ordained his destruction and\r\nour humbling before these Demons.” And he said, “Omens thicken upon us,\r\nO Gro. First, the night raven that went widdershins round about the\r\npalace of Carcë, that night when the King accepted this challenge, and\r\nwe were all drunken with wine after our great feasting and surfeiting\r\nin his halls. Next, the stumbling of the King whenas he went upon the\r\npoop of the long ship which bare us on this voyage to these islands.\r\nNext, the squint-eyed cup-bearer that poured out unto us yesternight.\r\nAnd throughout, the devilish pride and bragging humour of the King. No\r\nmore: he is fey. And the dice fall against him.”\r\n\r\nGro spake and said, “O Corund, I will not hide it from thee that my\r\nheart is heavy as thy heart under shadow of ill to be. For as I lay\r\nsleeping betwixt the strokes of night, a dream of the night stood by\r\nmy bed and beheld me with a glance so fell that I was all adrad and\r\nquaking with fear. And it seemed to me that the dream smote the roof\r\nabove my bed, and the roof opened and disclosed the outer dark, and in\r\nthe dark travelled a bearded star, and the night was quick with fiery\r\nsigns. And blood was on the roof, and great gouts of blood on the\r\nwalls and on the cornice of my bed. And the dream screeched like the\r\nscreech-owl, and cried, _Witchland from thy hand, O King!_ And\r\nmethought the whole world was lighted in a lowe, and with a great cry I\r\nawoke out of the dream.”\r\n\r\n“Thou art wise,” said Corund; “and belike the dream was a true dream,\r\nsent thee through the gate of horn, and belike it forebodeth events\r\ngreat and evil for the King and for Witchland.”\r\n\r\nGro said, “Disclose it not to the others, for none can strive with Fate\r\nand gain the victory, and it would but cast down their hearts. But it\r\nis fitting we be ready against evil hap. If (which yet may the Gods\r\nforfend) ill come of this wrastling bout, fail not every one of you ere\r\nyou act on any enterprise to take counsel of me. ‘Bare is back without\r\nbrother behind it.’ Together must we do that we do.”\r\n\r\n“Thou hast my firm assurance on’t,” said Corund.\r\n\r\nNow began a great company to come forth from the palace and take their\r\nstand on either side of the wrastling ground. The Red Foliot sate in\r\nhis car of polished ebony, drawn by six black horses with flowing manes\r\nand tails; before him went his musicians, pipers and minstrels doing\r\ntheir craft, and behind him fifty spearmen, weighed down with armour\r\nand ponderous shields that covered them from chin to toe. Their armour\r\nwas stained with madder, in such wise that they seemed bathed in blood.\r\nMild to look on was the Red Foliot, yet kingly. His skin was scarlet\r\nlike the head of the green woodpecker. He wore a diadem of silver, and\r\nrobes of scarlet trimmed with black fur.\r\n\r\nSo when the Foliots were assembled, one stood forth with a horn at the\r\ncommand of the Red Foliot and blew three blasts. Therewith came forth\r\nfrom their booths the lords of Demonland and their men-at-arms, Juss,\r\nGoldry, Spitfire, and Brandoch Daha, all armed as for battle save\r\nGoldry, who was muffled in a cloak of cloth of gold with great hearts\r\nworked thereon in red silk thread. And from their booths in turn came\r\nthe lords of Witchland all armed, and their fighting men, and little\r\nlove there was in the glances they and the Demons cast upon each other.\r\nIn the midst stalked the King, his great limbs muffled, like Goldry’s,\r\nin a cloak: and it was of black silk lined with black bearskin, and\r\nornamented with crabs worked in diamonds. The crown of Witchland,\r\nfashioned like a hideous crab and encrusted with jewels so thickly\r\nthat none might discern the iron whereof it was framed, weighed on\r\nhis beetling brow. His beard was black and bristly, spade-shaped and\r\nthick: his hair close cropped. His upper lip was shaved, displaying his\r\nsneering mouth, and from the darkness below his eyebrows looked forth\r\neyes that showed a green light, like those of a wolf. Corund walked at\r\nthe King’s left elbow, his giant frame an inch less in stature than\r\nthe King. Corinius went on the right, wearing a rich cloak of sky-blue\r\ntissue over his shining armour. Tall and soldier-like was Corinius, and\r\nyoung and goodly to look upon, with swaggering gait and insolent eye,\r\nthick-lipped withal and somewhat heavy of feature, and the sun shone\r\nbrightly on his shaven jowl.\r\n\r\nNow the Red Foliot let sound the horn again, and standing in his ebony\r\ncar he read out the conditions, as thus:\r\n\r\n“O Gorice XI., most glorious King of Witchland, and O Lord Goldry\r\nBluszco, captain of the hosts of Demonland, it is compact betwixt you,\r\nand made fast by mighty oaths whereof I, the Red Foliot, am keeper,\r\nthat ye shall wrastle three falls together on these conditions, namely,\r\nthat if Gorice the King be victorious, then hath he that glory and\r\nwithal full liberty to enforce with the sword his claims of lordship\r\nover many-mountained Demonland: but if victory fall to the Lord Goldry\r\nBluszco, then shall the Demons let the Witches abide in peace, and they\r\nthem, and the Witches shall forswear for ever their claims of lordship\r\nover the Demons. And you, O King, and you, O Goldry Bluszco, are\r\nlikewise bound by oath to wrastle fairly and to abide by the ruling of\r\nme, the Red Foliot, whom ye are content to choose as your umpire. And\r\nI do swear to judge justly between you. And the laws of your wrastling\r\nare that neither shall strangle his adversary with his hands, nor bite\r\nhim, nor claw nor scratch his flesh, nor poach out his eyes, nor smite\r\nhim with his fists, nor do any other unfair thing against him, but in\r\nall other respects ye shall wrastle freely together. And he that shall\r\nbe brought to earth with hip or shoulder shall be accounted fallen.”\r\n\r\nThe Red Foliot said, “Have I spoken well, O King, and do you swear to\r\nthese conditions?”\r\n\r\nThe King said, “I swear.”\r\n\r\nThe Red Foliot asked in like manner, “Dost thou swear to these\r\nconditions, O Lord Goldry Bluszco?”\r\n\r\nAnd Goldry answered him, “I swear.”\r\n\r\nWithout more ado the King stepped into the wrastling ground on his\r\nside, and Goldry Bluszco on his, and they cast aside their rich mantles\r\nand stood forth naked for the wrastling. And folk stood silent for\r\nadmiration of the thews and sinews of those twain, doubting which were\r\nmightier of build and likelier to gain the victory. The King stood\r\ntaller by a little, and was longer in the arm than Goldry. But the\r\ngreat frame of Goldry showed excellent proportions, each part wedded to\r\neach as in the body of a God, and if either were brawnier of chest it\r\nwas he, and he was thicker of neck than the King.\r\n\r\nNow the King mocked Goldry, saying, “Rebellious hound, it is fit that\r\nI make demonstration unto thee, and unto these Foliots and Demons that\r\nwitness our meeting, that I am thy King and Lord not by virtue only\r\nof this my crown of Witchland, which I thus put by for an hour, but\r\neven by the power of my body over thine and by my might and main. Be\r\nsatisfied that I will not have done with thee until I have taken away\r\nthy life, and sent thy soul squealing bodiless into the unknown. And\r\nthy skull and thy marrow-bones will I have away to Carcë, to my palace,\r\nto be a token unto all the world that I have been the bane of an\r\nhundredth great champion by my wrastling, and thou not least among them\r\nthat I have slain in that exercise. Thereafter, when I have eaten and\r\ndrunken and made merry in my royal palace at Carcë, I will sail with my\r\narmies over the teeming deep to many-mountained Demonland. And it shall\r\nbe my footstool, and these other Demons the slaves of me, yea, and the\r\nslaves of my slaves.”\r\n\r\nBut the Lord Goldry Bluszco laughed lightly and said to the Red Foliot,\r\n“O Red Foliot, I am not come hither to contend with the King of\r\nWitchland in windy railing, but to match my strength against his, sinew\r\nagainst sinew.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow they stood ready, and the Red Foliot made a sign with his hand, and\r\nthe cymbals clashed for the first bout.\r\n\r\nAt the clash the two champions advanced and clasped one another with\r\ntheir strong arms, each with his right arm below and left arm above\r\nthe other’s shoulder, until the flesh shrank beneath the might of\r\ntheir arms that were as brazen bands. They swayed a little this way\r\nand that, as great trees swaying in a storm, their legs planted firmly\r\nso that they seemed to grow out of the ground like the trunks of oak\r\ntrees. Nor did either yield ground to other, nor might either win a\r\nmaster hold upon his enemy. So swayed they back and forth for a long\r\ntime, breathing heavily. And now Goldry, gathering his strength, gat\r\nthe King lifted a little from the ground, and was minded to swing him\r\nround and so dash him to earth. But the King, in that moment when\r\nhe found himself lifted, leaned forward mightily and smote his heel\r\nswiftly round Goldry’s leg on the outside, striking him behind and a\r\nlittle above the ankle, in such wise that Goldry was fain to loosen his\r\nhold on the King; and greatly folk marvelled that he was able in that\r\nplight to save himself from being thrown backward by the King. So they\r\ngripped again until red wheals rose on their backs and shoulders by\r\nreason of the grievous clasping of their arms. And the King on a sudden\r\ntwisted his body sideways, with his left side turned from Goldry; and\r\ncatching with his leg Goldry’s leg on the inside below the great muscle\r\nof the calf, and hugging him yet closer, he lurched mightily against\r\nhim, striving to pull Goldry backward and so fall upon him and crush\r\nhim as they fell to earth. But Goldry leaned violently forward, ever\r\ntightening his hold on the King, and so violently bare he forward in\r\nhis strength that the King was baulked of his design; and clutched\r\ntogether they fell both to earth side by side with a heavy crash, and\r\nlay bemused while one might count half a score.\r\n\r\nThe Red Foliot proclaimed them even in this bout, and each returned to\r\nhis fellows to take breath and rest for a space.\r\n\r\nNow while they rested, a flittermouse flew forth from the Witchland\r\nbooths and went widdershins round the wrastling ground and so returned\r\nsilently whence she came. Lord Gro saw her, and his heart waxed heavy\r\nwithin him. He spake to Corund and said, “Needs must that I make trial\r\neven at this late hour if there be not any means to turn the King from\r\nfurther adventuring of himself, ere all be lost.”\r\n\r\nCorund said, “Be it as thou wilt, but it will be in vain.”\r\n\r\nSo Gro stood by the King and said, “Lord, give over this wrastling.\r\nGreat of growth and mightier of limb than any that you did overcome\r\naforetime is this Demon, yet have you vanquished him. For you did throw\r\nhim, as we plainly saw, and wrongfully hath the Red Foliot adjudged\r\nyou evenly matched because in the throwing of him your majesty’s self\r\ndid fall to earth. Tempt not the fates by another bout. Yours is the\r\nvictory in this wrastling: and now we, your servants, wait but your\r\nnod to make a sudden onslaught on these Demons and slay them, as we\r\nmay lightly overcome them taken at unawares. And for the Foliots, they\r\nbe peaceful and sheep-like folk, and will be held in awe when we have\r\nsmitten the Demons with the edge of the sword. So may you depart, O\r\nKing, with pleasure and great honour, and afterward fare to Demonland\r\nand bring it into subjection.”\r\n\r\nThe King looked sourly upon Lord Gro, and said, “Thy counsel is\r\nunacceptable and unseasonable. What lieth behind it?”\r\n\r\nGro answered, “There have been omens, O King.”\r\n\r\nAnd the King said, “What omens?”\r\n\r\nGro answered and said, “I will not hide it from you, O my Lord the\r\nKing, that in my sleep about the darkest hour a dream of the night\r\ncame to my bed and beheld me with a glance so fell that the hairs of\r\nmy head stood up and pale terror gat hold upon me. And methought the\r\ndream smote up the roof above my bed, and the roof yawned to the naked\r\nair of the midnight, that laboured with fiery signs, and a bearded\r\nstar travelling in the houseless dark. And I beheld the roof and the\r\nwalls one gore of blood. And the dream screeched like the screech-owl,\r\ncrying, _Witchland from thy hand, O King!_ And therewith the whole\r\nworld seemed lighted in one flame, and with a shout I awoke sweating\r\nfrom the dream.”\r\n\r\nBut the King rolled his eyes in anger upon Lord Gro and said, “Well am\r\nI served and faithfully by such false scheming foxes as thou. It ill\r\nfits your turn that I should carry this deed to the end with mine own\r\nhand only, and in the blindness of your impudent folly ye come to me\r\nwith tales made for scaring of babes, praying me gently to forgo my\r\nglory that thou and thy fellows may make yourselves big in the world’s\r\neyes by deeds of arms.”\r\n\r\nGro said, “Lord, it is not so.”\r\n\r\nBut the King would not hear him, but said, “Methinks it is for loyal\r\nsubjects to seek greatness in the greatness of their King, nor desire\r\nto shine of their own brightness. As for this Demon, when thou sayest\r\nthat I have overcome him thou speakest a gross and impudent lie. In\r\nthis bout I did but measure myself with him. But thereby know I of a\r\nsurety that when I put forth my might he will not be able to withstand\r\nme; and all ye shall shortly behold how, as one shattereth a stalk of\r\nangelica, I will break and shatter the limbs of this Goldry Bluszco.\r\nAs for thee, false friend, subtle fox, unfaithful servant, this long\r\ntime am I grown weary of thee slinking up and down my palace devising\r\ndarkly things I know not: thou, that art nought akin to Witchland, but\r\nan outlander, a Goblin exile, a serpent warmed in my bosom to my hurt.\r\nBut these things shall have an end. When I have put down this Goldry\r\nBluszco, then shall I have leisure to put down thee also.”\r\n\r\nAnd Gro bowed in sorrow of heart before the anger of the King, and held\r\nhis peace.\r\n\r\nNow was the horn blown for the second bout, and they stepped into the\r\nwrastling ground. At the clashing of the cymbals the King sprang at\r\nGoldry as the panther springeth, and with the rush bare him backward\r\nand well nigh forth of the wrastling ground. But when they were carried\r\nalmost among the Demons where they stood to behold the contest, Goldry\r\nswung to the left and strove as before to get the King lifted off\r\nhis feet; but the King foiled him and bent his ponderous weight upon\r\nhim, so that Goldry’s spine was like to have been crushed beneath\r\nthe murthering violence of the King’s arms. Then did the Lord Goldry\r\nBluszco show forth his great power as a wrastler, for, even under the\r\nmurthering clasp of the King, he by the might that was in the muscles\r\nof his brawny chest shook the King first to the right and then to the\r\nleft; and the King’s hold was loosened, and all his skill and mastery\r\nbut narrowly saved him from a grievous fall. Nor did Goldry delay nor\r\nponder how next to make trial of the King, but sudden as the lightning\r\nhe slackened his hold and turned, and with his back under the King’s\r\nbelly gave a mighty lift; and they that witnessed it stood amazed in\r\nexpectancy to see the King thrown over Goldry’s head. Yet for all his\r\nstriving might not Goldry get the King lifted clean off the ground.\r\nTwice and three times he strove, and at each trial he seemed further\r\nfrom his aim, and the King bettered his hold. And at the fourth essay\r\nthat Goldry made to lift the King over his back and fling him headlong,\r\nthe King thrust him forward and tripped him from behind, so that Goldry\r\nwas crawled on his hands and knees. And the King clung to him from\r\nbehind and passed his arms round his body beneath the armpits and so\r\nback over the shoulders, being minded to clasp his two hands at the\r\nback of Goldry’s neck.\r\n\r\nThen said Corund, “The Demon is sped already. By this hold hath the\r\nKing brought to their bane more than three score famous champions. He\r\ndelayeth only till his fingers be knit together behind the neck of the\r\naccursed Demon to draw the head of him forward until the bones of the\r\nneck or the breastbone be bursten asunder.”\r\n\r\n“He delayeth over long for my peace,” said Gro.\r\n\r\nThe King’s breath came out of him in great puffs and grunts as he\r\nstrained to bring his fingers to meet behind Goldry’s neck. Nor was it\r\naught else than the hugeness of his neck and burly chest that saved the\r\nLord Goldry Bluszco in that hour from utter destruction. Crawled on\r\nhis hands and knees he could nowise escape from the hold of the King,\r\nneither lay hold on him in turn; howbeit because of the bigness of\r\nGoldry’s neck and chest it was impossible for the King to fasten that\r\nhold upon him, for all his striving.\r\n\r\nWhen the King perceived that this was so, and that he but wasted his\r\nstrength, he said, “I will loose my hold on thee and let thee up, and\r\nwe will stand again face to face. For I deem it unworthy to grapple on\r\nthe ground like dogs.”\r\n\r\nSo they stood up, and wrastled another while in silence. Soon the King\r\nmade trial once again of the fall whereby he had sought to throw him\r\nin the first bout, twisting suddenly his right side against Goldry,\r\nand catching with his leg Goldry’s leg, and therewith leaning against\r\nhim with main force. And when, as before, Goldry bare forward with\r\ngreat violence, tightening his grip, the King lurched mightily against\r\nhim, and, being still ill content to have missed his hold that never\r\nheretofore had failed him, he thrust his fingers up Goldry’s nose in\r\nhis cruel anger, scratching and clawing at the delicate inner parts\r\nof the nostrils in such wise that Goldry was fain to draw back his\r\nhead. Therewith the King, lurching against him yet more heavily, gat\r\nhim thrown a grievous fall on his back, and himself fell atop of him,\r\ncrushing him and stunning him on the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd the Red Foliot proclaimed Gorice the King victorious in this bout.\r\n\r\nTherewithal the King turned him back to his Witches, that loudly\r\nacclaimed his mastery over Goldry. He said unto Lord Gro, “It is as I\r\nhave spoken: the testing first, next the bruising, and in the last\r\nbout the breaking and killing.” And the King looked evilly on Gro.\r\nGro answered him not a word, for his soul was grieved to see blood on\r\nthe nails and fingers of the King’s left hand, and he thought he knew\r\nthat the King must have been sore bested in this bout, seeing that he\r\nmust do this beastly deed or ever he might overcome the might of his\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\nBut the Lord Goldry Bluszco when he was come to his senses and had\r\ngotten him up from that great fall, spake to the Red Foliot in mickle\r\nwrath, saying, “This devil hath overcome me by craft, doing that which\r\nit is a shame to do, in that he clawed me with his fingers up my nose.”\r\n\r\nThe sons of Corund raised an uproar at the words of Goldry, loudly\r\ncrying that he was the greatest liar and dastard; and all they of\r\nWitchland shouted and cursed in like manner. But Goldry shouted in a\r\nvoice like a brazen trumpet that was plain to hear above the clamour\r\nof the Witches, “O Red Foliot, judge now fairly betwixt me and King\r\nGorice, as thou art sworn to do. Let him show his finger nails, if\r\nthere be not blood on them. This fall is void, and I claim that we\r\nwrastle it anew.” And the lords of Demonland in like manner shouted\r\nthat this fall should be wrastled anew.\r\n\r\nNow the Red Foliot had seen somewhat of what was done, and well was\r\nhe minded to call the bout void. Yet had he forborne to do this out\r\nof fear of King Gorice that had looked upon him with a basilisk’s\r\neye, threatening him. And now, while the Red Foliot was troubled in\r\nhis mind, uncertain between the angry shouts of the Witches and the\r\nDemons whether safety lay rather with his honour or with truckling to\r\nKing Gorice, the King spake a word to Corinius, who went straightway\r\nand standing by the Red Foliot spake privily in his ear. And Corinius\r\nmenaced the Red Foliot, and said, “Beware lest thy mind be swayed by\r\nthe brow-beating of the Demons. Rightfully hast thou adjudged the\r\nvictory in this bout unto our Lord the King, and this talk of thrusting\r\nof fingers in the nose is but a pretext and a vile imagination of this\r\nGoldry Bluszco, who, being thrown fairly before thine eyes and before\r\nus all, and perceiving himself unable to stand against the King, now\r\nthinketh with his swaggering he can bear it away, and thinketh by\r\ncheats and subtleties to avoid defeat. If, against thine own beholding\r\nand the witness of us and the plighted word of the King, thou art\r\nso hardy as to harken to the guileful persuading of these Demons,\r\nyet bethink thee that the King hath overborne ninety and nine great\r\nchampions in this exercise, and this shall be the hundredth; and\r\nbethink thee, too, that Witchland lieth nearer to thine Isles than\r\nDemonland by many days’ sailing. Hard shall it be for thee to abide the\r\navenging sword of Witchland if thou do him despite, and against thy\r\nsworn oath as umpire incline wrongfully to his enemies in this dispute.”\r\n\r\nSo spake Corinius; and the Red Foliot was cowed. Albeit he believed in\r\nhis heart that the King had done that whereof Goldry accused him, yet\r\nfor terror of the King and of Corinius that stood by and threatened him\r\nhe durst not speak his thought, but in sore perplexity gave order for\r\nthe horn to be blown for the third bout.\r\n\r\nAnd it came to pass at the blowing of the horn that the flittermouse\r\nfared forth again from the booths of the Witches, and going widdershins\r\nround about the wrastling ground returned on silent wing whence she\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lord Goldry Bluszco understood that the Red Foliot would pay\r\nno heed to his accusation, he grew red as blood. A fearsome sight it\r\nwas to behold how he swelled in his wrath, and his eyes blazed like\r\ndisastrous stars at midnight, and being wood with anger he gnashed his\r\nteeth till the froth stood at his lips and slavered down his chin.\r\nNow the cymbals clashed for the onset. Therewith ran Goldry upon the\r\nKing as one straught of his wits, bellowing as he ran, and gripped him\r\nby the right arm with both his hands, one at the wrist and one near\r\nthe shoulder. And so it was that, before the King might move, Goldry\r\nspun round with his back to the King and by his mickle strength and\r\nthe strength of the anger that was in him he heaved the King over his\r\nhead, hurling him as one hurleth a ponderous spear, head-foremost to\r\nthe earth. And the King smote the ground with his head, and the bones\r\nof his head and his spine were driven together and smashed, and blood\r\nflowed from his ears and nose. With the might of that throw Goldry’s\r\nwrath departed from him and left him strengthless, in such sort that\r\nhe reeled as he went from the wrastling ground. His brethren, Juss and\r\nSpitfire, bare him up on either side, and put his cloak of cloth of\r\ngold worked with red hearts about his mighty limbs.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile dismay was fallen upon the Witches to behold their King so\r\ncaught up on a sudden and dashed upon the ground, where he lay crumpled\r\nin an heap, shattered like the stalk of an hemlock that one breaketh\r\nand shattereth. In great agitation the Red Foliot came down from his\r\ncar of ebony and made haste thither where the King was fallen; and the\r\nlords of Witchland came likewise thither stricken at heart, and Corund\r\nlifted the King in his burly arms. But the King was stone dead. So\r\nthose sons of Corund made a litter with their spears and laid the King\r\non the litter, and spread over him his royal mantle of black silk lined\r\nwith bearskin, and set the crown of Witchland on his head, and without\r\nword spoken bare him away to the Witches’ booths. And the other lords\r\nof Witchland without word spoken followed after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          III: THE RED FOLIOT\r\n\r\n  OF THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE WITCHES IN THE PALACE OF THE RED\r\n      FOLIOT; AND OF THE WILES AND SUBTLETIES OF LORD GRO; AND HOW\r\n      THE WITCHES DEPARTED BY NIGHT OUT OF THE FOLIOT ISLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Red Foliot gat him back into his palace and sat in his high seat.\r\nAnd he sent unto the lords of Witchland and of Demonland that they\r\nshould come and see him. Nor did they delay, but came straightway and\r\nsat on the long benches, the Witches on the eastern side of the hall\r\nand the Demons on the west; and their fighting men stood in order on\r\neither side behind them. So sat they in the shadowy hall, and the sun\r\ndeclining to the western ocean shone through the high windows of the\r\nhall on the polished armour and weapons of the Witches.\r\n\r\nThe Red Foliot spake among them and said, “A great champion hath been\r\nstrook to earth this day in fair and equal combat. And according to the\r\nsolemn oaths whereby ye are bound, and whereof I am the keeper, there\r\nis here an end to all unpeace betwixt Witchland and Demonland, and ye\r\nof Witchland are to forswear for ever your claims of lordship over\r\nthe Demons. Now for a sealing and making fast of this solemn covenant\r\nbetween you I see no likelier rede than that ye all join with me here\r\nthis day in good friendship to forget your quarrels in drinking of the\r\narvale of King Gorice XI., than whom hath reigned none mightier nor\r\nmore worshipful in all this world, and thereafter depart in peace to\r\nyour native lands.”\r\n\r\nSo spake the Red Foliot, and the lords of Witchland assented thereto.\r\n\r\nBut Lord Juss answered and said, “O Red Foliot, as to the oaths sworn\r\nbetween us and the King of Witchland, thou hast spoken well; nor shall\r\nwe depart one tittle from the article of our oaths, and the Witches\r\nmay abide in peace for ever as for us if, as is clean against their\r\nuse and nature, they forbear to devise evil against us. For the nature\r\nof Witchland was ever as a flea, that attacketh a man in the dark. But\r\nwe will not eat nor drink with the lords of Witchland, who bewrayed\r\nand forsook us their sworn confederates at the sea-fight against the\r\nGhouls. Nor we will not drink the arvale of King Gorice XI., who worked\r\na shameful and unlawful sleight against my kinsman this day when they\r\nwrastled together.”\r\n\r\nSo spake Lord Juss, and Corund whispered Gro in the ear, saying,\r\n“Were’t not for the privilege of this respected company, now were the\r\ntime to set upon them.” But Gro said, “I prithee yet have patience.\r\nThis were over hazardous, for the luck goeth against Witchland. Let us\r\nrather take them in their beds to-night.”\r\n\r\nFain would the Red Foliot turn the Demons from their resolve, but\r\nwithout avail; they courteously thanking him for his hospitality which\r\nthey said they would enjoy that night in their booths, being minded on\r\nthe morrow to take to their beaked ship and fare over the unvintaged\r\nsea to Demonland.\r\n\r\nTherewith stood up Lord Juss, and with him the Lord Goldry Bluszco,\r\nthat went in all his war gear, his horned helm of gold and his golden\r\nbyrny set with ruby hearts, and bare his two-handed sword forged by\r\nthe elves wherewith he slew the beast out of the sea in days gone by;\r\nand Lord Spitfire that glared upon the lords of Witchland as a falcon\r\nglareth, hungering for her prey; and the Lord Brandoch Daha that\r\nlooked on them, and chiefly on Corinius, with the eye of contemptuous\r\namusement, playing idly with the jewelled hilt of his sword, until\r\nCorinius grew ill at ease beneath his gaze and shifted this way and\r\nthat in his seat, scowling back defiance. For all the rich array and\r\ngoodly port and countenance of Corinius, he seemed but a very boor\r\nbeside the Lord Brandoch Daha, and dearly did each hate the other. So\r\nthe lords of Demonland with their fighting men went forth from the hall.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe Red Foliot sent after them and made them in their own booths to be\r\nserved of great plenty of wine and good and delicate meats, and sent\r\nthem musicians and a minstrel to gladden them with songs and stories\r\nof old time, that they might lack nought of entertainment. But for his\r\nother guests he let bear in the massy cups of silver, and the great\r\neared wine jars holding two firkins apiece, and he let pour forth to\r\nthe Witches and the Foliots, and they drank the cup of memory unto King\r\nGorice XI., slain that day by the hand of Goldry Bluszco. Thereafter\r\nwhen their cups were brimmed anew with foaming wine the Red Foliot\r\nspake among them and said, “O ye lords of Witchland, will you that I\r\nspeak a dirge in honour of Gorice the King that the dark reaper hath\r\nthis day gathered?” So when they said yea to this, he called to him his\r\nplayer on the theorbo and his player on the hautboy, and commanded them\r\nsaying, “Play me a solemn music.” And they played softly in the Aeolian\r\nmode a music that was like the wailing of wind through bare branches on\r\na moonless night, and the Red Foliot leaned forth from his high seat\r\nand recited this lamentation:\r\n\r\n    I that in heill was and gladness\r\n    Am trublit now with great sickness\r\n      And feblit with infirmitie:—\r\n      _Timor Mortis conturbat me_.\r\n\r\n    Our plesance here is all vain glory,\r\n    This fals world is but transitory,\r\n      The flesh is bruckle, the Feynd is slee:—\r\n      _Timor Mortis conturbat me_.\r\n\r\n    The state of man does change and vary,\r\n    Now sound, now sick, now blyth, now sary,\r\n      Now dansand mirry, now like to die:—\r\n      _Timor Mortis conturbat me_.\r\n\r\n    No state in Erd here standis sicker;\r\n    As with the wynd wavis the wicker,\r\n      So wannis this world’s vanitie:—\r\n      _Timor Mortis conturbat me_.\r\n\r\n    Unto the Death gois all Estatis,\r\n    Princis, Prelattis, and Potestatis,\r\n      Baith rich and poor of all degree:—\r\n      _Timor Mortis conturbat me_.\r\n\r\n    He takis the knichtis in to field\r\n    Enarmit under helm and scheild;\r\n      Victor he is at all mellie:—\r\n      _Timor Mortis conturbat me_.\r\n\r\n    That strong unmerciful tyrand\r\n    Takis, on the motheris breast sowkand,\r\n      The babe full of benignitie:—\r\n      _Timor Mortis conturbat me_.\r\n\r\n    He takis the campion in the stour,\r\n    The captain closit in the tour,\r\n      The lady in bour full of bewtie:—\r\n      _Timor Mortis conturbat me_.\r\n\r\n    He spairis no lord for his piscence,\r\n    Na clerk for his intelligence;\r\n      His awful straik may no man flee:—\r\n      _Timor Mortis conturbat me_.\r\n\r\n    Art-magicianis and astrologis,\r\n    Rethoris, logicianis, theologis,\r\n      Them helpis no conclusionis slee:—\r\n      _Timor Mortis conturbat me_.\r\n\r\n    In medecine the most practicianis,\r\n    Leechis, surrigianis, and physicianis,\r\n      Themself from Death may nocht supplee:—\r\n      _Timor Mortis conturbat me_.\r\n\r\nWhen the Red Foliot had spoken thus far his dirge, he was interrupted\r\nby an unseemly brawling betwixt Corinius and one of the sons of Corund.\r\nFor Corinius, who gave not a fig for music or dirges, but liked well of\r\ncarding and dicing, had brought forth his dice box to play with the son\r\nof Corund. They played awhile to Corinius’s great content, for at every\r\nthrow he won and the other’s purse waxed light. But at this eleventh\r\nstanza the son of Corund cried out that the dice of Corinius were\r\nloaded. And he smote Corinius on his shaven jowl with the dice box,\r\ncalling him cheat and mangy rascal, whereupon Corinius drew forth a\r\nbodkin to smite him in the neck withal; but some went betwixt them, and\r\nwith much ado and much struggling and cursing they were parted, and it\r\nbeing shown that the dice were not loaded, the son of Corund was fain\r\nto make amends to Corinius, and so were they set at one again.\r\n\r\nNow was the wine poured forth yet again to the lords of Witchland, and\r\nthe Red Foliot drank deep unto the glory of that land and the rulers\r\nthereof. And he issued command saying, “Let my Kagu come and dance\r\nbefore us, and thereafter my other dancers. For there is no pleasure\r\nwhereon the Foliots do more dearly dote than this pleasure of the\r\ndance, and sweet to us it is to behold delightful dancing, be it the\r\nstately splendour of the Pavane which progresseth as large clouds at\r\nsun-down that pass by in splendour; or the graceful Allemande; or\r\nthe Fandango, which goeth by degrees from languorous beauty to the\r\nswiftness and passion of Bacchanals dancing on the high lawns under a\r\nsummer moon that hangeth in the pine trees; or the joyous maze of the\r\nGalliard; or the Gigue, dear to the Foliots. Therefore delay not, but\r\nlet my Kagu come, that she may dance before us.”\r\n\r\nTherewith hastened the Kagu into the shadowy hall, moving softly and\r\nrolling a little in her gait, with her head thrust forward; and a\r\nlittle flurried was she in her bearing as she darted this way and that\r\nher large and beautiful eyes, mild and timid, that were like liquid\r\ngold heated to redness. Somewhat like a heron she was, but stouter,\r\nand shorter of leg, and her beak shorter and thicker than the heron’s;\r\nand so long and delicate was her pale gray plumage that hard it was\r\nto say whether it were hair or feathers. So the wind instruments and\r\nthe lutes and dulcimers played a Coranto, and the Kagu tripped up the\r\nhall betwixt the long tables, jumping a little and bowing a little in\r\nher step and keeping excellent time to the music; and when she came\r\nnear to the dais where the Red Foliot sat ravished with delight at her\r\ndancing, the Kagu lengthened her step and glided smoothly and slowly\r\nforward toward the Red Foliot; and so gliding she drew herself up in\r\nstately wise and opened her mouth and drew back her head till her beak\r\nlay tight against her breast, flouncing out her feathers so that they\r\nshowed like a widecut skirt with a crinoline, and the crest that was\r\non her head rose up erect half again her own height from the ground,\r\nand she sailed majestically toward the Red Foliot. On this wise did the\r\nKagu at every turn that she took in the Coranto, forth and back along\r\nthe length of the Foliots’ hall. And they all laughed sweetly at her,\r\nbeing overjoyed at her dancing. When the dance was done, the Red Foliot\r\ncalled the Kagu to him and made her sit on the bench beside him, and\r\nstroked her soft gray feathers and made much of her. All bashfully she\r\nsat beside the Red Foliot, casting her ruby eyes in wonder upon the\r\nWitches and their company.\r\n\r\nNext the Red Foliot called for his Cat-bears, that stood before him\r\nfoxy-red above but with black bellies, round furry faces, and innocent\r\namber eyes, and soft great paws, and tails barred alternately with\r\nruddy rings and creamy; and he said, “O Cat-bears, dance before us,\r\nsince dearly we delight in your dancing.”\r\n\r\nThey asked, “Lord, will you that we perform the Gigue?”\r\n\r\nAnd he answered them, “The Gigue, and ye love me.”\r\n\r\nSo the stringed instruments began a swift movement, and the tambourines\r\nand triangles entered on the beat, and swiftly twinkled the feet of\r\nthe Cat-bears in the joyous dance. The music rippled and ran and the\r\ndancers danced till the hall was awhirl with the rhythm of their\r\ndancing, and the Witches roared applause. On a sudden the music ceased,\r\nand the dancers were still, and standing side by side, paw in furry\r\npaw, they bowed shyly to the company, and the Red Foliot called them\r\nto him and kissed them on the mouth and sent them to their seats, that\r\nthey might rest and view the dances that were to follow.\r\n\r\nNext the Red Foliot called for his white Peacocks, coloured like\r\nmoonlight, that they might lead the Pavane before the lords of\r\nWitchland. In glorious wise did they spread their tails for the stately\r\ndance, and a fair and lovely sight it was to see their grace and the\r\ngrandeur of their carriage as they moved to the music chaste and noble.\r\nWith them were joined the Golden Pheasants, who spread wide their\r\ncollars of gold, and the Silver Pheasants, and the Peacock Pheasants,\r\nand the Estridges, and the Bustards, footing it in pomp, pointing the\r\ntoes, and bowing and retiring in due time to the solemn strains of the\r\nPavane. Every instrument took part in the stately Pavane: the lutes and\r\nthe dulcimers, and the theorbos, and the sackbuts, and the hautboys;\r\nthe flutes sweetly warbling as birds in the upper air, and the silver\r\ntrumpets, and the horns that breathed deep melodies trembling with\r\nmystery and tenderness that shakes the heart; and the drum that beateth\r\nto battle, and the wild throb of the harp, and the cymbals clashing as\r\nthe clash of armies. And a nightingale sitting by the Red Foliot sang\r\nthe Pavane in passionate tones that dissolved the soul in their sweet,\r\nmournful beauty.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Gro covered his face with his mantle and wept to hear and\r\nbehold the divine Pavane; for as ghosts rearisen it raised up for him\r\nold happy half-forgotten days in Goblinland, before he had conspired\r\nagainst King Gaslark and been driven forth from his dear native land,\r\nan exile in waterish Witchland.\r\n\r\nThereafter let the Red Foliot give order for the Galliard. Joyously\r\nswept forth the melody from the stringed instruments, and two dormice,\r\nfat as butter, spun into the hall. Wilder whirled the music, and the\r\ndormice capered ever higher till they bounded from the floor up to\r\nthe beams of the vaulted roof, and down again, and up again to the\r\nroof-beams in the joyful dance. And the Foliots joined in the Galliard,\r\nspinning and capering in mad delight of the dance. And into the hall\r\ntwirled six capripeds, footing it lightly as the music swept ever\r\nfaster, and a one-footer that leaped hither and thither about and\r\nabout, as the flea hoppeth, till the Witches grew hoarse with singing\r\nand shouting and hounding of him on. Yet ever capered the dormice\r\nhigher and wilder than any else, and so swiftly flashed their little\r\nfeet to the galloping music that no eye might follow their motion.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nBut little enow was Lord Gro gladdened by the merry dance. Sad\r\nmelancholy sat with him for his companion, darkening his thoughts and\r\nmaking joy hateful to him as sunshine to owls of the night. So that he\r\nwas well pleased to mark the Red Foliot go softly from his seat on the\r\ndais and forth from the hall by a door behind the arras, and seeing\r\nthis, himself departed softly amid the full tide of the Galliard, forth\r\nof that hall of swift movement and gleeful laughter, forth into the\r\nquiet evening, where above the smooth downs the wind was lulled to\r\nsleep in the vast silent spaces of the sky, and the west was a bower\r\nof orange light fading to purple and unfathomable blue in the upper\r\nheaven, and nought was heard save the murmur of the sleepless sea, and\r\nnought seen save a flight of wildfowl flying against the sunset. In\r\nthis quietness Gro walked westward above the combe until he came to\r\nthe land’s edge and stood on the lip of a chalk cliff falling to the\r\nsea, and was ware of the Red Foliot, alone on that high western cliff,\r\ngazing in a study at the dying colours in the west.\r\n\r\nWhen they had stood for a while without speech, gazing over the sea,\r\nGro spake and said, “Consider how as day now dieth in yonder chambers\r\nof the west, so hath the glory departed from Witchland.”\r\n\r\nBut the Red Foliot answered him not, being in a study.\r\n\r\nThen Gro said, “Though Demonland lieth where thou sawest the sun\r\ndescend, yet eastward out of Witchland must thou look for the morning\r\nsplendour. Not more surely shalt thou behold the sun go up thence\r\nto-morrow than thou shalt see shine forth in short season the glory and\r\nhonour and power of Witchland, and beneath her destructive sword her\r\nenemies shall be as grass before the sickle.”\r\n\r\nThe Red Foliot said, “I am in love with peace and the soft influence of\r\nthe evening air. Leave me; or if thou wilt stay, break not the charm.”\r\n\r\n“O Red Foliot,” said Gro, “art thou in love with peace indeed? So\r\nshould the rising again of Witchland tune sweet music to thy thought,\r\nsince we of Witchland love peace, nor are we stirrers up of strife, but\r\nthe Demons only. The war against the Ghouls, whereby the four corners\r\nof the earth were shaken, was hatched by Demonland——”\r\n\r\n“Thou speakest,” said the Red Foliot, “clean against thine intention,\r\na great praise of them. For who ever saw the like of these man-eating\r\nGhouls for corruption of manners, inhuman degeneration, and deluge\r\nof iniquities? Who every fifth year from time immemorial have had\r\ntheir grand climacterical year, and but last year brake forth in\r\nnever-imagined ferocity. But if they sail now, ’tis on the dark lake\r\nthey sail, grieving no earthly seas nor rivers. Praise Demonland,\r\ntherefore, who did put them down for ever.”\r\n\r\n“I make no question of that,” answered Lord Gro. “But foul water, as\r\nsoon as fair, will quench hot fire. Sore against our will did we of\r\nWitchland join with the Demons in that war, foreseeing (as hath been\r\nbloodily approved) that the issue must be but the puffing up of the\r\nDemons, who desire no other thing than to be lords and tyrants of all\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\n“Thou,” said the Red Foliot, “wast in thy young days King Gaslark’s\r\nman: a Goblin born and bred: his very foster-brother, nourished at the\r\nsame breast. Why must I observe thee, a plain traitor against so good\r\na king? Whose perfidy the common people then did openly reprove (as I\r\ndid well perceive even so lately as last autumn, when I was in the city\r\nof Zajë Zaculo at the time of their festivities for the betrothal of\r\nthe king’s cousin german the Princess Armelline unto the Lord Goldry\r\nBluszco), they carrying filthy pictures of thee in the street, singing\r\nof thee thus:\r\n\r\n    It was pittie\r\n    One so wittie\r\n      Malcontent:\r\n    Leaving reason\r\n    Should to treason\r\n      So be bent.\r\n\r\n    But his gifts\r\n    Were but shifts\r\n      Void of grace:\r\n    And his braverie\r\n    Was but knaverie\r\n      Vile and base.”\r\n\r\nSaid Gro, wincing a little, “The art of it agreeth well with the\r\nsentiment, and with the condition of those who invented it. I will not\r\nthink so noble a prince as thou art will set thy sails to the wind of\r\nthe rabble’s most partial hates and envies. For the vile addition of\r\ntraitor, I do reject and spit upon it. But true it is that, regarding\r\nnot the god of fools and women, nice opinion, I do steer by mine own\r\nlode-star still. Howbeit, I came not to discourse to thee on so small a\r\nmatter as myself. This I would say unto thee with most sad and serious\r\nentertain: Be not lulled to think the Demons will leave the world at\r\npeace: that is farthest from their intent. They would not listen to thy\r\ncomfortable words nor sit at meat with us, so set be they to imagine\r\nmischief against us. What said Juss? ‘Witchland was ever as a flea’:\r\nay, as a flea which he itcheth to crush betwixt his finger-nails. O,\r\nif thou be in love with peace, a short way lieth open to thy heart’s\r\ndesire.”\r\n\r\nNought spake the Red Foliot, gazing still into the dim reflections of\r\nthe sunset which lingered below a darkening sky where stars were born.\r\nGro said softly, as a cat purring, “Where softening unctions failed,\r\nsharp surgery bringeth speediest ease. Wilt thou not leave it to me?”\r\n\r\nBut the Red Foliot looked angrily upon him, saying, “What have I to do\r\nwith your enmities? You are sworn to keep the peace, and I will not\r\nabide your violence nor your breaking of oaths in my quiet kingdom.”\r\n\r\nGro said, “Oaths be of the heart, and he that breaketh them in open\r\nfact is oft, as now, no breaker in truth, for already were they scorned\r\nand trampled on by his opposites.”\r\n\r\nBut the Red Foliot said again, “What have I to do with your enmities\r\nthat set you by the ears like fighting dogs? I am yet to learn that he\r\nthat hath a righteous heart, and clean hands, and hateth none, must\r\nneeds be drawn into the brawls and manslayings of such as you and the\r\nDemons.”\r\n\r\nLord Gro looked narrowly upon him, saying, “Thinkest thou that the\r\nstrait path of him that affecteth neither side lieth still open for\r\nthee? If that were thine aim, thou shouldst have bethought thee ere\r\nthou gavest thy judgement on the second bout. For clear as day it\r\nwas to us and to thine own people, and most of all to the Demons,\r\nthat the King played foul in that bout, and when thou calledst him\r\nvictorious thou didst loudly by that word trumpet thyself his friend,\r\nand unfriends to Demonland. Markedst thou not, when they left the\r\nhall, with what a snake’s eye Lord Juss beheld thee? Not with us only\r\nbut with thee he refused to eat and drink, that so his superstitious\r\nscruples may be unhurt when he proceeds to thy destruction. For on this\r\nare they determined. Nothing is more certain.”\r\n\r\nThe Red Foliot sank his chin upon his breast, and stood silent for a\r\nspace. The hues of death and silence spread themselves where late the\r\nfires of sunset glowed, and large stars opened like flowers on the\r\nillimitable fields of the night sky: Arcturus, Spica, Gemini, and the\r\nLittle Dog, and Capella and her Kids.\r\n\r\nThe Red Foliot said, “Witchland lieth at my door. And Demonland: how\r\nstand I with Demonland?”\r\n\r\nAnd Gro said, “Also to-morrow’s sun goeth up out of Witchland.”\r\n\r\nFor a while they spoke not. Then Lord Gro took forth a scroll from his\r\nbosom, and said, “The harvest of this world is to the resolute, and he\r\nthat is infirm of purpose is ground betwixt the upper and the nether\r\nmillstone. Thou canst not turn back: so would they scorn and spurn\r\nthee, and we Witches likewise. And now by these means only may lasting\r\npeace be brought about, namely, by the setting of Gorice of Witchland\r\non the throne of Demonland, and the utter humbling of that brood\r\nbeneath the heel of the Witches.”\r\n\r\nThe Red Foliot said, “Is not Gorice slain, and drank we not but now his\r\narvale, slain by a Demon? and is he not the second in order of that\r\nline who hath so died by a Demon?”\r\n\r\n“A twelfth Gorice,” said Gro, “at this moment of time sitteth King in\r\nCarcë. O Red Foliot, know thou that I am a reader of the planets of\r\nthe night and of those hidden powers that work out the web of destiny.\r\nWhereby I know that this twelfth King of the house of Gorice in Carcë\r\nshall be a most crafty warlock, full of guiles and wiles, who by the\r\nmight of his egromancy and the sword of Witchland shall exceed all\r\nearthly powers that be. And ineluctable as the levin-bolt of heaven\r\ngoeth out his wrath against his enemies.” So saying, Gro stooped and\r\ntook a glow-worm from the grass, saying kindly to it, “Sweeting, thy\r\nlamp for a moment,” and breathed upon it, and held it to the parchment,\r\nsaying, “Sign now thy royal name to these articles, which require thee\r\nnot at all to go to war, but only (in case war shall arise) to be of\r\nour party, and against these Demons that do privily pursue thy life.”\r\n\r\nBut the Red Foliot said, “Wherein am I certified that thou speakest not\r\na lie?”\r\n\r\nThen took Gro a writing from his purse and showed thereon a seal like\r\nthe seal of Lord Juss; and there was written: “Unto Voll al love and\r\ntruste: and fayll nat whenas thow saylest upon Wychlande to caste of\r\niij or iv shippes for the Folyott Isles to putt downe those and brenne\r\nthe Redd Folyott in hys hous. For if wee get nat the lyfe of these\r\nwormes chirted owt of them the shame will stikk on us for ever.” And\r\nGro said, “My servant stole this from them while they spoke with thee\r\nin thine hall to-night.”\r\n\r\nWhich the Red Foliot believed, and took from his belt his ink-horn\r\nand his pen, and signed his royal name to the articles of the treaty\r\nproposed to him.\r\n\r\nTherewith Lord Gro put up the parchment in his bosom and said, “Swift\r\nsurgery. Needs must that we take them in their beds to-night; so shall\r\nto-morrow’s dawn bring glory and triumph to Witchland, now fixed in an\r\neclipse, and to the whole world peace and soft contentment.”\r\n\r\nBut the Red Foliot answered him, “My Lord Gro, I have signed these\r\narticles, and thereby stand I bound in enmity to Demonland. But I\r\nwill not bewray my guests that have eaten my salt, be they never so\r\ndeeply pledged mine enemies. Be it known to thee, I have set guards on\r\nyour booths this night and on the booths of them of Demonland, that\r\nno unpeaceful deeds may be done betwixt you. This which I have done,\r\nby this will I stand, and ye shall both depart to-morrow in peace,\r\neven as ye came. Because I am your friend and sworn to your party, I\r\nand my Foliots will be on your side when war is between Witchland and\r\nDemonland. But I will not suffer night-slayings nor murthers in my\r\nIsles.”\r\n\r\nNow with these words of the Red Foliot, Lord Gro was as one that\r\nwalketh along a flowery path to his rest, and in the last steps a\r\ngulf yawneth suddenly athwart the path, and he standeth a-gape and\r\ndisappointed at the hither side. Yet in his subtlety he made no sign,\r\nbut straight replied, “Righteously hast thou decreed and wisely, O Red\r\nFoliot, for it was truly said:\r\n\r\n    Let worthy minds ne’er stagger in distrust\r\n    To suffer death or shame for what is just,\r\n\r\nand that which we sow in darkness must unfold in the open light of day,\r\nlest it be found withered in the very hour of maturity. Nor would I\r\nhave urged thee otherwise, but that I do throughly fear these Demons,\r\nand all my mind was to take their plotting in reverse. Do then one\r\nthing only for us. If we set sail homeward and they on our heels, they\r\nwill fall upon us at a disadvantage, for they have the swifter ship;\r\nor if they get to sea before us, they will lie in wait for us on the\r\nhigh seas. Suffer us then to sail to-night, and do thou on some pretext\r\ndelay them here for three days only, that we may get us home or ever\r\nthey leave the Foliot Isles.”\r\n\r\n“I will not gainsay thee in this,” answered the Red Foliot, “for here\r\nis nought but what is fair and just and lieth with mine honour. I will\r\ncome to your booths at midnight and bring you down to your ship.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nWhen Gro came to the Witches’ booths he found them guarded even as\r\nthe Red Foliot had said, and the booths of them of Demonland in like\r\nmanner. So went he into the royal booth where the King lay in state\r\non a bier of spear-shafts, robed in his kingly robes over his armour\r\nthat was painted black and inlaid with gold, and the crown of Witchland\r\non his head. Two candles burned at the head of King Gorice and two at\r\nhis feet; and the night wind blowing through the crannies of the booth\r\nmade them flare and flicker, so that shadows danced unceasingly on\r\nthe wall and roof and floor. On the benches round the walls sat the\r\nlords of Witchland sullen of countenance, for the wine was dead in\r\nthem. Balefully they eyed Lord Gro at his coming in, and Corinius sate\r\nupright in his seat and said, “Here is the Goblin, father and fosterer\r\nof our misfortunes. Come, let us slay him.”\r\n\r\nGro stood among them with head erect and held Corinius with his eye,\r\nsaying, “We of Witchland are not run lunatic, my Lord Corinius, that\r\nwe should do this gladness to the Demons, to bite each at the other’s\r\nthroat like wolves. Methinks if Witchland be the land of my adoption\r\nonly, yet have I not done least among you to ward off sheer destruction\r\nfrom her in this pass we stand in. If ye have aught against me, let me\r\nhear it and answer it.”\r\n\r\nCorinius laughed a bitter laugh. “Harken to the fool! Are we babies and\r\nmilksops, thinkest thou, and is it not clear as day thou stoodest in\r\nthe way of our falling on the Demons when we might have done so, urging\r\nwhat silly counsels I know not in favour of doing it by night? And now\r\nis night come, and we close prisoned in our booths, and no chance to\r\ncome at them unless we would bring an hornets’ nest of Foliots about\r\nour ears and give warning of our intent to the Demons and every living\r\nsoul in this island. And all this has come about since thy slinking off\r\nand plotting with the Red Foliot. But now hath thy guile overreached\r\nitself, and now we will kill thee, and so an end of thee and thy\r\nplotting.”\r\n\r\nWith that Corinius sprang up and drew his sword, and the other Witches\r\nwith him. But Lord Gro moved not an eyelid, only he said, “Hear mine\r\nanswer first. All night lieth before us, and ’tis but a moment’s task\r\nto murther me.”\r\n\r\nTherewith stood forth the Lord Corund with his huge bulk betwixt Gro\r\nand Corinius, saying in a great voice, “Whoso shall point weapon\r\n’gainst him shall first have to do with me, though it were one of my\r\nsons. We will hear him. If he clear not himself, then will we hew him\r\nin pieces.”\r\n\r\nThey sat down, muttering. And Gro spake and said, “First behold this\r\nparchment, which is the articles of a solemn covenant and alliance,\r\nand behold where the Red Foliot hath set his sign manual thereto.\r\nTrue, his is a country of no might in arms, and we might tread him\r\ndown and ne’er feel the leavings stick to our boot, and little avail\r\ncan their weak help be unto us in the day of battle. But there is in\r\nthese Isles a meetly good road and riding-place for ships, which if\r\nour enemies should occupy, their fleet were most aptly placed to do\r\nus all the ill imaginable. Is then this treaty a light benefit where\r\nnow we stand? Next, know that when I counselled you take the Demons\r\nin their beds ’stead of fall upon them in the Foliots’ hall, I did so\r\nbeing advertised that the Red Foliot had commanded his soldiers to turn\r\nagainst us or against the Demons, whichever first should draw sword\r\nupon the other. And when I went forth from the hall it was, as Corinius\r\nhath so deeply divined, to plot with the Red Foliot; but the aim of my\r\nplotting I have shown you, on these articles of alliance. And indeed,\r\nhad I as Corinius vilely accuseth me practised with the Red Foliot\r\nagainst Witchland, I had hardly been so simple as return into the mouth\r\nof destruction when I might have bided safely in his palace.”\r\n\r\nNow when Gro perceived that the anger of the Witches against him was\r\nappeased by his defence, wherein he spake cunningly both true words and\r\nlies, he spake again among them saying, “Little gain have I of all my\r\npains and thought expended by me for Witchland. And better it were for\r\nWitchland if my counsel were better heeded. Corund knoweth how, to mine\r\nown peril, I counselled the King to wrastle no more after the first\r\nbout, and if he had ta’en my rede, rather than suspect me and threaten\r\nme with death, we should not be now to bear him home dead to the royal\r\ncatacombs in Carcë.”\r\n\r\nCorund said, “Truly hast thou spoken.”\r\n\r\n“In one thing only have I failed,” said Gro; “and it can shortly be\r\namended. The Red Foliot, albeit of our party, will not be won to\r\nattack the Demons by fraud, nor will he suffer us smite them in these\r\nIsles. Some fond simple scruples hang like cobwebs in his mind, and he\r\nis stubborn as touching this. But I have prevailed upon him to make\r\nthem tarry here for three days’ space, while we put to sea this very\r\nnight, telling him, which he most innocently believeth, that we fear\r\nthe Demons, and would flee home ere they be let loose to take us at a\r\ndisadvantage on the high seas. And home we will indeed ere they set\r\nsail, yet not for fear of them, but rather that we may devise a deadly\r\nblow against them or ever they win home to Demonland.”\r\n\r\n“What blow, Goblin?” said Corinius.\r\n\r\nAnd Gro answered and said, “One that I will devise upon with our Lord\r\nthe King, Gorice XII., who now awaiteth us in Carcë. And I will not\r\nblab it to a wine-bibber and a dicer who hath but now drawn sword\r\nagainst a true lover of Witchland.” Whereupon Corinius leaped up in\r\nmickle wrath to thrust his sword into Gro. But Corund and his sons\r\nrestrained him.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIn due time the stars revolved to midnight, and the Red Foliot came\r\nsecretly with his guards to the Witches’ booths. The lords of Witchland\r\ntook their weapons and the men-at-arms bare the goods, and the King\r\nwent in the midst on his bier of spear-shafts. So went they picking\r\ntheir way in the moonless night round the palace and down the winding\r\npath that led to the bed of the combe, and so by the stream westward\r\ntoward the sea. Here they deemed it safe to light a torch to show\r\nthem the way. Desolate and bleak showed the sides of the combe in the\r\nwind-blown flare; and the flare was thrown back from the jewels of the\r\nroyal crown of Witchland, and from the armoured buskins on the King’s\r\nfeet showing stark with toes pointing upward from below his bear-skin\r\nmantle, and from the armour and the weapons of them that bare him and\r\nwalked beside him, and from the black cold surface of the little river\r\nhurrying for ever over its bed of boulders to the sea. The path was\r\nrugged and stony, and they fared slowly, lest they should stumble and\r\ndrop the King.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    IV: CONJURING IN THE IRON TOWER\r\n\r\n  OF THE HOLD OF CARCË, AND OF THE MIDNIGHT PRACTICES OF KING GORICE\r\n      XII. IN THE ANCIENT CHAMBER, PREPARING DOLE AND DOOM FOR THE\r\n      LORDS OF DEMONLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Witches were come aboard of their ship and all stowed, and\r\nthe rowers set in order on the benches, they bade farewell to the\r\nRed Foliot and rowed out to the deep, and there hoisted sail and put\r\nup their helm and sailed eastward along the land. The stars wheeled\r\noverhead, and the east grew pale, and the sun came out of the sea on\r\nthe larboard bow. Still sailed they two days and two nights, and on\r\nthe third day there was land ahead, and morning rose abated by mist\r\nand cloud, and the sun was as a ball of red fire over Witchland in the\r\neast. So they hung awhile off Tenemos waiting for the tide, and at\r\nhigh water sailed over the bar and up the Druima past the dunes and\r\nmud-flats and the Ergaspian mere, till they reached the bend of the\r\nriver below Carcë. Solitary marsh-land stretched on either side as\r\nfar as the eye might reach, with clumps of willow and rare homesteads\r\nshowing above the flats. Northward above the bend a bluff of land fell\r\nsharply to the elbow of the river, and on the other side sloped gently\r\naway for a few miles till it lost itself in the dead level of the\r\nmarshes. On the southern face of the bluff, monstrous as a mountain in\r\nthose low sedge-lands, hung square and black the fortress of Carcë.\r\nIt was built of black marble, rough-hewn and unpolished, the outworks\r\nenclosing many acres. An inner wall with a tower at each corner formed\r\nthe main stronghold, in the south-west corner of which was the palace,\r\noverhanging the river. And on the south-west corner of the palace,\r\ntowering sheer from the water’s edge seventy cubits and more to the\r\nbattlements, stood the keep, a round tower lined with iron, bearing\r\non the corbel table beneath its parapet in varying form and untold\r\nrepetition the sculptured figure of the crab of Witchland. The outer\r\nward of the fortress was dark with cypress trees: black flames burning\r\nchangelessly to heaven from a billowy sea of gloom. East of the keep\r\nwas the water-gate, and beside it a bridge and bridge-house across the\r\nriver, strongly fortified with turrets and machicolations and commanded\r\nfrom on high by the battlements of the keep. Dismal and fearsome to\r\nview was this strong place of Carcë, most like to the embodied soul of\r\ndreadful night brooding on the waters of that sluggish river: by day a\r\nshadow in broad sunshine, the likeness of pitiless violence sitting in\r\nthe place of power, darkening the desolation of the mournful fen; by\r\nnight, a blackness more black than night herself.\r\n\r\nNow was the ship made fast near the water-gate, and the lords of\r\nWitchland landed and their fighting men, and the gate opened to them,\r\nand mournfully they entered in and climbed the steep ascent to the\r\npalace, bearing with them their sad burden of the King. And in the\r\ngreat hall in Carcë was Gorice XI. laid in state for that night; and\r\nthe day wore to its close. Nor was any word from King Gorice XII.\r\n\r\nBut when the shades of night were falling, there came a chamberlain to\r\nLord Gro as he walked upon the terrace without the western wall of the\r\npalace; and the chamberlain said, “My lord, the King bids you attend\r\nhim in the Iron Tower, and he chargeth you bring unto him the royal\r\ncrown of Witchland.”\r\n\r\nGro made haste to fulfil the bidding of the King, and betook himself to\r\nthe great banqueting hall, and all reverently he lifted the iron crown\r\nof Witchland set thick with priceless gems, and went by a winding stair\r\nto the tower, and the chamberlain went before him. When they were come\r\nto the first landing, the chamberlain knocked on a massive door that\r\nwas forthwith opened by a guard; and the chamberlain said, “My lord, it\r\nis the King’s will that you attend his majesty in his secret chamber\r\nat the top of the tower.” And Gro marvelled, for none had entered that\r\nchamber for many years. Long ago had Gorice VII. practised forbidden\r\narts therein, and folk said that in that chamber he raised up those\r\nspirits whereby he gat his bane. Sithence was the chamber sealed, nor\r\nhad the late Kings need of it, since little faith they placed in art\r\nmagical, relying rather on the might of their hands and the sword of\r\nWitchland. But Gro was glad at heart, for the opening of this chamber\r\nby the King met his designs half way. Fearlessly he mounted the winding\r\nstairs that were dusky with the shadows of approaching night and hung\r\nwith cobwebs and strewn with the dust of neglect, until he came to\r\nthe small low door of that chamber, and pausing knocked thereon and\r\nharkened for the answer.\r\n\r\nAnd one said from within, “Who knocketh?” and Gro answered, “Lord, it\r\nis I, Gro.” And the bolts were drawn and the door opened, and the King\r\nsaid, “Enter.” And Gro entered and stood in the presence of the King.\r\n\r\nNow the fashion of the chamber was that it was round, filling the\r\nwhole space of the loftiest floor of the round donjon keep. It was\r\nnow gathering dusk, and weak twilight only entered through the deep\r\nembrasures of the windows that pierced the walls of the tower,\r\nlooking to the four quarters of the heavens. A furnace glowing in\r\nthe big hearth threw fitful gleams into the recesses of the chamber,\r\nlighting up strange shapes of glass and earthenware, flasks and\r\nretorts, balances, hour-glasses, crucibles and astrolabes, a monstrous\r\nthree-necked alembic of phosphorescent glass supported on a bain-marie,\r\nand other instruments of doubtful and unlawful aspect. Under the\r\nnorthern window over against the doorway was a massive table blackened\r\nwith age, whereon lay great books bound in black leather with iron\r\nguards and heavy padlocks. And in a mighty chair beside this table\r\nwas King Gorice XII., robed in his conjuring robe of black and gold,\r\nresting his cheek on his hand that was lean as an eagle’s claw. The low\r\nlight, mother of shade and secrecy, that hovered in that chamber moved\r\nabout the still figure of the King, his nose hooked as the eagle’s\r\nbeak, his cropped hair, his thick close-cut beard and shaven upper\r\nlip, his high cheek-bones and cruel heavy jaw, and the dark eaves of\r\nhis brows whence the glint of green eyes showed as no friendly lamp to\r\nthem without. The door shut noiselessly, and Gro stood before the King.\r\nThe dusk deepened, and the firelight pulsed and blinked in that dread\r\nchamber, and the King leaned without motion on his hand, bending his\r\nbrow on Gro; and there was utter silence save for the faint purr of the\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\nIn a while the King said, “I sent for thee, because thou alone wast so\r\nhardy as to urge to the uttermost thy counsel upon the King that is now\r\ndead, Gorice XI. of memory ever glorious. And because thy counsel was\r\ngood. Marvellest thou that I wist of thy counsel?”\r\n\r\nGro said, “O my Lord the King, I marvel not of this. For it is known to\r\nme that the soul endureth, albeit the body perish.”\r\n\r\n“Keep thou thy lips from overspeech,” said the King. “These be\r\nmysteries whereon but to think may snatch thee into peril, and whoso\r\nspeaketh of them, though in so secret a place as this, and with me\r\nonly, yet at his most bitter peril speaketh he.”\r\n\r\nGro answered, “O King, I spake not lightly; moreover, you did tempt\r\nme by your questioning. Nevertheless I am utterly obedient to your\r\nmajesty’s admonition.”\r\n\r\nThe King rose from his chair and walked towards Gro, slowly. He was\r\nexceeding tall, and lean as a starved cormorant. Laying his hands upon\r\nthe shoulders of Gro, and bending his face to Gro’s, “Art not afeared,”\r\nhe asked, “to abide me in this chamber, at the close of day? Or hast\r\nnot thought on’t, and on these instruments thou seest, their use and\r\npurpose, and the ancient use of this chamber?”\r\n\r\nGro blenched never a whit, but stoutly said, “I am not afeared, O my\r\nLord the King, but rather rejoiced I at your summons. For it jumpeth\r\nwith mine own designs, when I took counsel secretly in my heart after\r\nthe woes that the Fates fulfilled for Witchland in the Foliot Isles.\r\nFor in that day, O King, when I beheld the light of Witchland darkened\r\nand her might abated in the fall of King Gorice XI. of glorious memory,\r\nI thought on you, Lord, the twelfth Gorice raised up King in Carcë; and\r\nthere was present to my mind the word of the soothsayer of old, where\r\nhe singeth:\r\n\r\n    Ten, eleven, twelf I see\r\n    In sequent varietie\r\n    Of puissaunce and maistrye\r\n    With swerd, sinwes, and grammarie,\r\n    In the holde of Carcë\r\n    Lordinge it royally.\r\n\r\nAnd being minded that he singleth out you, the twelfth, as potent in\r\ngrammarie, all my care was that these Demons should be detained within\r\nreach of your spells until we should have time to win home to you and\r\nto apprise you of their farings, that so you might put forth your\r\npower and destroy them by art magic or ever they come safe again to\r\nmany-mountained Demonland.”\r\n\r\nThe King took Gro to his bosom and kissed him, saying, “Art thou not a\r\nvery jewel of wisdom and discretion? Let me embrace thee and love thee\r\nfor ever.”\r\n\r\nThen the King stood back from him, keeping his hands on Gro’s\r\nshoulders, and gazed piercingly upon him for a space in silence. Then\r\nkindled he a taper that stood in an iron candlestick by the table\r\nwhere the books lay, and held it to Gro’s face. And the King said,\r\n“Ay, wise thou art and of good discretion, and some courage hast thou.\r\nBut if thou be to serve me this night, needs must I try thee first\r\nwith terrors till thou be inured to them, as tried gold runneth in the\r\ncrucible; or if thou be base metal only, till that thou be eaten up by\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nGro said unto the King, “For many years, Lord, or ever I came to Carcë,\r\nI fared up and down the world, and I am acquainted with objects of\r\nterror as a child with his toys. I have seen in the southern seas,\r\nby the light of Achernar and Canopus, giant sea-horses battling with\r\neight-legged cuttle-fishes in the whirlpools of the Korsh. Yet was I\r\nunafraid. I was in the isle Ciona when the fires of the pit brast forth\r\nin that isle and split it as a man’s skull is split with an axe, and\r\nthe green gulfs of the sea swallowed that isle, and the stench and the\r\nsteam hung in the air for days where the burning rock and earth had\r\nsizzled in the ocean. Yet was I unafraid. Also was I with Gaslark in\r\nthe flight out of Zajë Zaculo, when the Ghouls took the palace over\r\nour heads, and portents walked in his halls in broad daylight, and\r\nthe Ghouls conjured the sun out of heaven. Yet was I unafraid. And\r\nfor thirty days and thirty nights wandered I alone on the face of the\r\nMoruna in Upper Impland, where scarce a living soul hath been: and\r\nthere the evil wights that people the air of that desert dogged my\r\nsteps and gibbered at me in darkness. Yet was I unafraid; and came\r\nin due time to Morna Moruna, and thence, standing on the lip of the\r\nescarpment as it were on the edge of the world, looked southaway where\r\nnever mortal eye had gazed aforetime, across the untrodden forests of\r\nthe Bhavinan. And in that skyey distance, pre-eminent beyond range\r\non range of ice-robed mountains, I beheld two peaks throned for ever\r\nbetween firm land and heaven in unearthly loveliness: the spires and\r\nairy ridges of Koshtra Pivrarcha, and the wild precipices that soar\r\nupward from the abysses to the queenly silent snow-dome of Koshtra\r\nBelorn.”\r\n\r\nWhen Gro had ended, the King turned him away and, taking from a shelf\r\na retort filled with a dark blue fluid, set it on a bain-marie, and\r\na lamp thereunder. Fumes of a faint purple hue came forth from the\r\nneck of the retort, and the King gathered them in a flask. He made\r\nsigns over the flask and shook forth into his hand therefrom a fine\r\npowder. Then said he unto Gro, holding out the powder in the open palm\r\nof his hand, “Look narrowly at this powder.” And Gro looked. The King\r\nmuttered an incantation, and the powder moved and heaved, and was like\r\na crawling mass of cheesemites in an overripe cheese. It increased\r\nin volume in the King’s hand, and Gro perceived that each particular\r\ngrain had legs. The grains grew before his eyes, and became the size\r\nof mustard seeds, and then of barleycorns, swiftly crawling each over\r\nother. And even as he marvelled, they waxed great as kidney beans, and\r\nnow was their shape and seeming clear to him, so that he beheld that\r\nthey were small frogs and paddocks; and they overflowed from the King’s\r\nhand as they waxed swiftly in size, pouring on to the floor. And they\r\nceased not to increase and grow; and now were they large as little\r\ndogs, nor might the King retain more than a single one, holding his\r\nhand under its belly while it waved its legs in the air; and they were\r\nwalking on the tables and jostling on the floor. Pallid they were, and\r\npermeable to light like thin horn, and their hue a faint purple, even\r\nas the hue of the vapour whence they were engendered. And now was the\r\nroom filled with them so that they mounted perforce one on another’s\r\nshoulders, and they were of the bigness of well fatted hogs; and they\r\ngoggled their eyes at Gro and croaked. The King looked narrowly on Gro,\r\nwho stood in the presence of that spectacle, the crown of Witchland in\r\nhis hands; and the King marked that the crown trembled not a whit in\r\nGro’s hands that held it. So he said a certain word, and the paddocks\r\nand the frogs grew small again, shrinking more swiftly than they had\r\ngrown, and so vanished.\r\n\r\nThe King now took from the shelf a ball the size of the egg of an\r\nestridge, of dark green glass. He said unto Gro, “Look well at this\r\nglass and tell me what thou seest.” Gro answered him, “I see a shifting\r\nshadow within.” The King commanded him saying, “Dash it down with all\r\nthy strength upon the floor.” The Lord Gro lifted the ball with both\r\nhands above his head, and it was ponderous as a ball of lead, and\r\naccording to the command of Gorice the King he hurled it on the floor,\r\nso that it was pashed in pieces. And, behold, a puff of thick smoke\r\nburst forth from the fragments of the ball and took the form of one\r\nof human shape and dreadful aspect, whose two legs were two writhing\r\nsnakes; and it stood in the chamber so tall that the head of it touched\r\nthe vaulted ceiling, viewing the King and Gro malevolently and menacing\r\nthem. The King caught down a sword that hung against the wall, and put\r\nit in Gro’s hand, shouting, “Smite off the legs of it! and delay not,\r\nor thou art but dead!” Gro smote and cut off the left leg of the evil\r\nwight, easily, as it were cutting of butter. But from the stump came\r\nforth two fresh snakes a-writhing; and so it fared likewise with the\r\nright leg, but the King shouted, “Smite and cease not, or thou art but\r\na dead dog!” and ever as Gro hewed a snake in twain forth came two\r\nmore from the wound, till the chamber was a maze of their wriggling\r\nforms. And still Gro hewed with a will, until the sweat stood on his\r\nbrow, and he said, panting between the strokes, “O King, I have made\r\nhim many-legged as a centipede: must I make him a myriapod ere night’s\r\ndecline?” And the King smiled, and spake a word of hidden meaning; and\r\ntherewith the turmoil was gone as a gust of wind departeth, and nought\r\nleft save the shivered splinters of the green ball on the chamber floor.\r\n\r\n“Wast not afeared?” asked the King, and when Gro said nay, “Methinks\r\nthese sights of terror should much afflict thee,” said the King, “since\r\nwell I know thou art not skilled in art magical.”\r\n\r\n“Yet am I a philosopher,” answered Lord Gro; “and somewhat know I of\r\nalchymy and the hidden properties of this material world: the virtues\r\nof herbs, plants, stones, and minerals, the ways of the stars in their\r\ncourses, and the influences of those heavenly bodies. And I have held\r\nconverse with birds and fishes in their degree, and that generation\r\nwhich creepeth on the earth is not held in scorn by me, but oft talk I\r\nin sweet companionship with the eft of the pond, and the glow-worm, and\r\nthe lady-bird, and the pismire, and their kind, making them my little\r\ngossips. So have I a certain lore which lighteth me in the outer court\r\nof the secret temple of grammarie and art forbid, albeit I have not\r\npeered within that temple. And by my philosophy, O King, I am certified\r\nconcerning these apparitions which you have raised for me, that they\r\nbe illusions and phantasms only, able to terrify the soul indeed of\r\nhim that knoweth not divine philosophy, but without bodily power or\r\nessence. Nor is aught to fear in such, save the fear itself wherewith\r\nthey strike the simple.”\r\n\r\nThen said the King, “By what token knowest thou this?”\r\n\r\nAnd the Lord Gro made answer unto him, “O King, as a child weaveth a\r\ndaisy-chain, thus easily did you conjure up these shapes of terror. Not\r\nin such wise fareth he that calleth out of the deep the deadly terror\r\nindeed; but with toil and sweat and with straining of thought, will,\r\nheart, and sinew fareth he.”\r\n\r\nThe King smiled. “Thou sayest true. Now, therefore, since\r\nphantasmagoria maketh not thy heart to quail, I present thee a more\r\nmaterial horror.”\r\n\r\nAnd he lighted the candles in the great candlesticks of iron and\r\nopened a little secret door in the wall of the chamber near the floor;\r\nand Gro beheld iron bars within the little door, and heard a hissing\r\nfrom behind the bars. The King took a key of silver of delicate\r\nconstruction, the handle slender and three spans in length, and opened\r\nthe iron grated door. And the King said, “Behold and see, that which\r\nsprung from the egg of a cock, hatched by the deaf adder. The glance\r\nof its eye sufficeth to turn to stone any living thing that standeth\r\nbefore it. Were I but for one instant to loose my spells whereby I hold\r\nit in subjection, in that moment would end my life days and thine. So\r\nstrong in properties of ill is this serpent which the ancient Enemy\r\nthat dwelleth in darkness hath placed upon this earth, to be a bane\r\nunto the children of men, but an instrument of might in the hand of\r\nenchanters and sorcerers.”\r\n\r\nTherewith came forth that offspring of perdition from its hole,\r\nstrutting erect on its two legs that were the legs of a cock; and a\r\ncock’s head it had, with rosy comb and wattles, but the face of it\r\nlike no fowl’s face of middle-earth but rather a gorgon’s out of Hell.\r\nBlack shining feathers grew on its neck, but the body of it was the\r\nbody of a dragon with scales that glittered in the rays of the candles,\r\nand a scaly crest stood on its back; and its wings were like bats’\r\nwings, and its tail the tail of an aspick with a sting in the end\r\nthereof, and from its beak its forked tongue flickered venomously. And\r\nthe stature of the thing was a little above a cubit. Now because of\r\nthe spells of King Gorice whereby he held it ensorcelled it might not\r\ncast its baneful glance upon him, nor upon Gro, but it walked back and\r\nforth in the candle light, averting its eyes from them. The feathers\r\non its neck were fluffed up with anger and wondrous swiftly twirled\r\nits scaly tail, and it hissed ever more fiercely, irked by the bonds\r\nof the King’s enchantment; and the breath of it was noisome, and hung\r\nin sluggish wreaths about the chamber. So for a while it walked before\r\nthem, and as it looked sidelong past him Gro beheld the light of its\r\neyes that were as sick moons burning poisonously through a mist of\r\ngreenish yellow in the dusk of night. And strong loathing seized him,\r\nso that his gorge rose to behold the thing, and his brow and the palms\r\nof his hands became clammy, and he said, “My Lord the King, I have\r\nlooked steadfastly on this cockatrice and it affrighteth me no whit,\r\nbut it is loathly in my sight, so that my gorge riseth because of it,”\r\nand with that he fell a-vomiting. And the King commanded that serpent\r\nback into its hole, whither it returned, hissing wrathfully.\r\n\r\nNow the King poured forth wine, speaking a charm over the cup, and\r\nwhen the bright wine had revived Lord Gro, the King spake saying, “It\r\nis well, O Gro, that thou hast shown thyself a philosopher indeed, and\r\nof heart intrepid. Yet even as no blade is utterly tried until one\r\ntry it in very battle, where if it snap woe and doom wait on the hand\r\nthat wields it, so must thou in this midnight suffer a yet fiercer\r\nfurnace-heat of terror, wherein if thou be reduced we are both lost\r\neternally, and this Carcë and all Witchland blasted with us for ever in\r\nruin and oblivion. Durst abide this trial?”\r\n\r\nGro answered, “I am hot to obey your word, O King. For well know I that\r\nit is idle to hope by phantoms and illusions to appal the Demons, and\r\nthat against the Demons the deadly eye of thy cockatrice were turned\r\nin vain. Stout of heart are they, and instructed in all lore, and\r\nJuss a sorcerer of ancient power, who hath charms to blunt the glance\r\nof basilisk or cockatrice. He that would strike down the Demons must\r\nconjure indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Great,” said the King, “is the strength and cunning of the seed of\r\nDemonland. By main strength have they now shown mastery over us, as\r\nsadly witnesseth the overthrow of Gorice XI., ’gainst whom no mortal\r\ncould stand up and wrastle and not die, till cursed Goldry, drunk\r\nwith spleen and envy, slew him in the Foliot Isles. Nor was there any\r\naforetime to outdo us in feats of arms, and Gorice X., victorious in\r\nsingle combats without number, made our name glorious over all the\r\nworld. Yet at the last he gat his death, out of all expectation and by\r\nwhat treacherous sleight I know not, standing in single combat against\r\nthe curled step-dancer from Krothering. But I, that am skilled in\r\ngrammarie, do bear a mightier engine against the Demons than brawny\r\nsinews or the sword that smiteth asunder. Yet is mine engine perilous\r\nto him that useth it.”\r\n\r\nTherewith the King unlocked the greatest of those books that lay by\r\non the massive table, saying in Gro’s ear, as one who would not be\r\noverheard, “This is that awful book of grammarie wherewith in this same\r\nchamber, on such a night, Gorice VII. stirred the vasty deep. And know\r\nthat from this circumstance alone ensued the ruin of King Gorice VII.,\r\nin that, having by his hellish science conjured up somewhat from the\r\nprimaeval dark, and being utterly fordone with the sweat and stress of\r\nhis conjuring, his mind was clouded for a moment, in such sort that\r\neither he forgot the words writ in this grammarie, or the page whereon\r\nthey were writ, or speech failed him to speak those words that must\r\nbe spoken, or might to do those things which must be done to complete\r\nthe charm. Wherefore he kept not his power over that which he had\r\ncalled out of the deep, but it turned upon him and tare him limb from\r\nlimb. Such like doom will I avoid, renewing in these latter days those\r\nself-same spells, if thou durst stand by me undismayed the while I\r\nutter my incantations. And shouldst thou mark me fail or waver ere all\r\nbe accomplished, then shalt thyself lay hand on book and crucible and\r\nfulfil whatsoever is needful, as I shall first show thee. Or quailest\r\nthou at this?”\r\n\r\nGro said, “Lord, show me my task. And I will carry it, though all the\r\nFuries of the pit flock to this chamber to say me nay.”\r\n\r\nSo the King instructed Gro, rehearsing to him those acts that were\r\nneedful, and making known unto him the divers pages of the grammarie\r\nwhereon were writ those words which must be spoken each in its due\r\ntime and sequence. But the King pronounced not yet those words,\r\npointing only to them in the book, for whoso speaketh those words in\r\nvain and out of season is lost. And now when the retorts and beakers\r\nwith their several necks and tubes and the appurtenances thereof were\r\nset in order, and the unhallowed processes of fixation, conjunction,\r\ndeflagration, putrefaction, and rubefication were nearing maturity,\r\nand the baleful star Antares standing by the astrolabe within a little\r\nof the meridian signified the instant approach of midnight, the\r\nKing described on the floor with his conjuring rod three pentacles\r\ninclosed within a seven-pointed star, with the signs of Cancer and\r\nof Scorpio joined by certain runes. And in the midst of the star he\r\nlimned the image of a green crab eating of the sun. And turning to the\r\nseventy-third page of his great black grammarie the King recited in a\r\nmighty voice words of hidden meaning, calling on the name that it is a\r\nsin to utter.\r\n\r\nNow when he had spoken the first spell and was silent, there was a\r\ndeadly quiet in that chamber, and a chill in the air as of winter. And\r\nin the quiet Gro heard the King’s breath coming and going, as of one\r\nwho hath rowed a course. Now the blood rushed back to Gro’s heart and\r\nhis hands and feet became cold and a cold sweat brake forth on his\r\nbrow. But for all that, he held yet his courage firm and his brain\r\nready. The King motioned to Gro to break off the tail of a certain drop\r\nof black glass that lay on the table; and with the snapping of its\r\ntail the whole drop fell in pieces in a coarse black powder. Gro by\r\nthe King’s direction gathered that powder and dropped it in the great\r\nalembic wherein a green fluid seethed and bubbled above the flame of a\r\nlamp; and the fluid became red as blood, and the body of the alembic\r\nfilled with a tawny smoke, and sparks of sun-like brilliance flashed\r\nand crackled through the smoke. Thereupon distilled from the neck of\r\nthe alembic a white oil incombustible, and the King dipped his rod in\r\nthat oil and described round the seven-pointed star on the floor the\r\nfigure of the worm Ouroboros, that eateth his own tail. And he wrote\r\nthe formula of the crab below the circle, and spake his second spell.\r\n\r\nWhen that was done, yet more biting seemed the night air and yet more\r\nlike the grave the stillness of the chamber. The King’s hand shook as\r\nwith an ague as he turned the pages of the mighty book. Gro’s teeth\r\nchattered in his head. He gritted them together and waited. And now\r\nthrough every window came a light into the chamber as of skies paling\r\nto the dawn. Yet not wholly so; for never yet came dawn at midnight,\r\nnor from all four quarters of the sky at once, nor with such swift\r\nstrides of increasing light, nor with a light so ghastly. The candle\r\nflames burned filmy as the glare waxed strong from without: an evil\r\npallid light of bale and corruption, wherein the hands and faces of the\r\nKing Gorice and his disciple showed death-pale, and their lips black as\r\nthe dark skin of a grape where the bloom has been rubbed off from it.\r\nThe King cried terribly, “The hour approacheth!” And he took a phial of\r\ncrystal containing a decoction of wolf’s jelly and salamander’s blood,\r\nand dropped seven drops from the alembic into the phial and poured\r\nforth that liquor on the figure of the crab drawn on the floor. Gro\r\nleaned against the wall, weak in body but with will unbowed. So bitter\r\nwas the cold that his hands and feet were benumbed, and the liquor from\r\nthe phial congealed where it fell. Yet the sweat stood in beads on the\r\nforehead of the King by reason of the mighty striving that was his, and\r\nin the overpowering glare of that light from the underskies he stood\r\nstiff and erect, hands clenched and arms outstretched, and spake the\r\nwords LURO VOPO VIR VOARCHADUMIA.\r\n\r\nNow with those words spoken the vivid light departed as a blown-out\r\nlamp, and the midnight closed down again without. Nor was any sound\r\nheard save the thick panting of the King; but it was as if the night\r\nheld its breath in expectation of that which was to come. And the\r\ncandles sputtered and burned blue. The King swayed and clutched the\r\ntable with his left hand; and again the King pronounced terribly the\r\nword VOARCHADUMIA.\r\n\r\nThereafter for the space of ten heart-beats silence hung like a kestrel\r\npoised in the listening night. Then went a crash through earth and\r\nheaven, and a blinding wildfire through the chamber as it had been\r\na thunderbolt. All Carcë quaked, and the chamber was filled with\r\na beating of wings, like the wings of some monstrous bird. The air\r\nthat was wintry cold waxed on a sudden hot as the breath of a burning\r\nmountain, and Gro was near choking with the smell of soot and the smell\r\nof brimstone. And the chamber rocked as a ship riding in a swell with\r\nthe wind against the tide. But the King, steadying himself against the\r\ntable and clutching the edge of it till the veins on his lean hand\r\nseemed nigh to bursting, cried in short breaths and with an altered\r\nvoice, “By these figures drawn and by these spells enchanted, by the\r\nunction of wolf and salamander, by the unblest sign of Cancer now\r\nleaning to the sun, and by the fiery heart of Scorpio that flameth in\r\nthis hour on night’s meridian, thou art my thrall and instrument. Abase\r\nthee and serve me, worm of the pit. Else will I by and by summon out of\r\nancient night intelligences and dominations mightier far than thou, and\r\nthey shall serve mine ends, and thee shall they chain with chains of\r\nquenchless fire and drag thee from torment to torment through the deep.”\r\n\r\nTherewith the earthquake was stilled, and there remained but a\r\nquivering of the walls and floor and the wind of those unseen wings and\r\nthe hot smell of soot and brimstone burning. And speech came out of the\r\nteeming air of that chamber, strangely sweet, saying, “Accursed wretch\r\nthat troublest our quiet, what is thy will?” The terror of that speech\r\nmade the throat of Gro dry, and the hairs on his scalp stood up.\r\n\r\nThe King trembled in all his members like a frightened horse, yet was\r\nhis voice level and his countenance unruffled as he said hoarsely,\r\n“Mine enemies sail at day-break from the Foliot Isles. I loose thee\r\nagainst them as a falcon from my wrist. I give thee them. Turn them to\r\nthy will: how or where it skills not, so thou do but break and destroy\r\nthem off the face of the world. Away!”\r\n\r\nBut now was the King’s endurance clean spent, so that his knees failed\r\nhim and he sank like a sick man into his mighty chair. But the room\r\nwas filled with a tumult as of rushing waters, and a laughter above\r\nthe tumult like to the laughter of souls condemned. And the King was\r\nreminded that he had left unspoken that word which should dismiss his\r\nsending. But to such weariness was he now come and so utterly was his\r\nstrength gone out from him in the exercise of his spells, that his\r\ntongue clave to the roof of his mouth, so that he might not speak the\r\nword; and horribly he rolled up the whites of his eyes beckoning to\r\nGro, the while his nerveless fingers sought to turn the heavy pages\r\nof the grammarie. Then sprang Gro forth to the table, and against it\r\nsprawling, for now was the great keep of Carcë shaken anew as one\r\nshaketh a dice box, and lightnings opened the heavens, and the thunder\r\nroared unceasingly, and the sound of waters stunned the ear in that\r\nchamber, and still that laughter pealed above the turmoil. And Gro knew\r\nthat it was now with the King even as it had been with Gorice VII. in\r\nyears gone by, when his strength gave forth and the spirit tare him and\r\nplastered those chamber-walls with his blood. Yet was Gro mindful, even\r\nin that hideous storm of terror, of the ninety-seventh page whereon\r\nthe King had shown him the word of dismissal, and he wrenched the book\r\nfrom the King’s palsied grasp and turned to the page. Scarce had his\r\neye found the word, when a whirlwind of hail and sleet swept into the\r\nchamber, and the candles were blown out and the tables overset. And in\r\nthe plunging darkness beneath the crashing of the thunder Gro pitching\r\nheadlong felt claws clasp his head and body. He cried in his agony the\r\nword, that was the word TRIPSARECOPSEM, and so fell a-swooning.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIt was high noon when the Lord Gro came to his senses in that chamber.\r\nThe strong spring sunshine poured through the southern window, lighting\r\nup the wreckage of the night. The tables were cast down and the\r\nfloor strewn and splashed with costly essences and earths spilt from\r\nshattered phials and jars and caskets: aphroselmia, shell of gold,\r\nsaffron of gold, asem, amianth, stypteria of Melos, confounded with\r\nmandragora, vinum ardens, sal armoniack, devouring aqua regia, little\r\npools and scattered globules of quicksilver, poisonous decoctions\r\nof toadstools and of yewberries, monkshood, thornapple, wolf’s bane\r\nand black hellebore, quintessences of dragon’s blood and serpent’s\r\nbile; and with these, splashed together and wasted, elixirs that\r\nwise men have died a-dreaming of: spiritus mundi, and that sovereign\r\nalkahest which dissolveth every substance dipped therein, and that\r\naurum potabile which being itself perfect induceth perfection in the\r\nliving frame. And in this welter of spoiled treasure were the great\r\nconjuring books hurled amid the ruin of retorts and aludels of glass\r\nand lead and silver, sand-baths, matrasses, spatulae, athanors, and\r\nother instruments innumerable of rare design, tossed and broken on\r\nthe chamber floor. The King’s chair was thrown against the furnace,\r\nand huddled against the table lay the King, his head thrown back, his\r\nblack beard pointing skyward, showing his sinewy hairy throat. Gro\r\nlooked narrowly at him; saw that he seemed unhurt and slept deep; and\r\nso, knowing well that sleep is a present remedy for every ill, watched\r\nby the King in silence all day till supper time, for all he was sore\r\nan-hungered.\r\n\r\nWhen at length the King awoke, he looked about him in amaze. “Methought\r\nI tripped at the last step of last night’s journey,” he said. “And\r\ntruly strange riot hath left its footprints in my chamber.”\r\n\r\nGro answered, “Lord, sorely was I tried; yet fulfilled I your behest.”\r\n\r\nThe King laughed as one whose soul is at ease, and standing upon his\r\nfeet said unto Gro, “Take up the crown of Witchland and crown me. And\r\nthat high honour shalt thou have, because I do love thee for this night\r\ngone by.”\r\n\r\nNow without were the lords of Witchland assembled in the courtyard,\r\nbeing bound for the great banqueting hall to eat and drink, unto\r\nwhom the King came forth from the gate below the keep, robed in his\r\nconjuring robe. Wondrous bright sparkled the gems of the iron crown\r\nof Witchland above the heavy brow and cheek-bones and the fierce\r\ndisdainful lip of the King, as he stood there in his majesty, and Gro\r\nwith the guard of honour stood in the shadow of the gate. And the King\r\nsaid, “My lords Corund and Corsus and Corinius and Gallandus, and ye\r\nsons of Corsus and of Corund, and ye other Witches, behold your King,\r\nthe twelfth Gorice, crowned with this crown in Carcë to be King of\r\nWitchland and of Demonland. And all countries of the world and the\r\nrulers thereof, so many as the sun doth spread his beams over, shall do\r\nme obeisance, and call me King and Lord.”\r\n\r\nAll they shouted assent, praising the King and bowing down before him.\r\n\r\nThen said the King, “Imagine not that oaths sworn unto the Demons by\r\nGorice XI. of memory ever glorious bind me any whit. I will not be at\r\npeace with this Juss and his brethren, but do account them all mine\r\nenemies. And this night have I made a sending to take them on the waste\r\nof waters as they sail homeward to many-mountained Demonland.”\r\n\r\nCorund said, “Lord, your words are as wine unto us. And well we guessed\r\nthat the principalities of darkness were afoot last night, seeing all\r\nCarcë rocked and the foundations thereof rose and fell as the breast of\r\nthe large earth a-breathing.”\r\n\r\nWhen they were come into the banqueting hall, the King said, “Gro\r\nshall sit at my right hand this night, since manfully hath he served\r\nme.” And when they scowled at this, and spake each in the other’s ear,\r\nthe King said, “Whoso among you shall so serve me and so water the\r\ngrowth of this Witchland as hath Gro in this night gone by, unto him\r\nwill I do like honour.” But unto Gro he said, “I will bring thee home\r\nto Goblinland in triumph, that wentest forth an exile. I will pluck\r\nGaslark from his throne, and make thee king in Zajë Zaculo, and all\r\nGoblinland shalt thou hold for me in fee, exercising dominion over it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       V: KING GORICE’S SENDING\r\n\r\n  OF KING GASLARK, AND OF THE COMING OF THE SENDING UPON THE DEMONS\r\n      ON THE HIGH SEAS; WITH HOW THE LORD JUSS BY THE EGGING ON OF\r\n      HIS COMPANIONS WAS PERSUADED TO AN UNADVISED RASHNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning following that night when King Gorice XII. sat crowned\r\nin Carcë as is aforesaid, was Gaslark a-sailing on the middle sea,\r\nhomeward from the east. Seven ships of war he had, and they steered\r\nin column south-westward close hauled on the starboard tack. Greatest\r\nand fairest among them was she who led the line, a great dragon of war\r\npainted azure of the summer sea with towering head of a worm, plated\r\nwith gold and wrought with overlapping scales, gaping defiance from her\r\nbows, and a worm’s tail erect at the poop. Seventy and five picked men\r\nof Goblinland sailed on that ship, clad in gay kirtles and byrnies of\r\nmail and armed with axes, spears, and swords. Their shields, each with\r\nhis device, hung at the bulwarks. On the high poop sat King Gaslark,\r\nhis sturdy hands grasping the great steering paddle. Goodly of mien and\r\nwell knit were all they of Goblinland that went on that great ship,\r\nyet did Gaslark outdo them all in goodliness and strength and all\r\nkingliness. He wore a silken kirtle of Tyrian purple. Broad wristlets\r\nof woven gold were on his wrists. Dark-skinned was he as one that hath\r\nlived all his days in the hot sunshine: clean-cut of feature, somewhat\r\nhooky-nosed, with great eyes and white teeth and tight-curled black\r\nmoustachios. Nought restful was there in his presence and bearing, but\r\nrashness and impetuous fire; and he was wild to look on, swift and\r\nbeautiful as a stag in autumn.\r\n\r\nTeshmar, that was the skipper of his ship, stood at his elbow. Gaslark\r\nsaid to him, “Is it not one of the three gallant spectacles of the\r\nworld, a good ship treading the hastening furrows of the sea like a\r\nqueen in grace and beauty, scattering up the wave-crests before her\r\nstem in a glittering rain?”\r\n\r\n“Yea, Lord,” answered he; “and what be the other two?”\r\n\r\n“One that I most unhappily did miss, whereof but yesterday we had\r\ntidings: to behold such a battling of great champions and such a\r\nvictory as Lord Goldry obtained upon yonder vaunting tyrant.”\r\n\r\n“The third shall be seen, I think,” said Teshmar, “when the Lord Goldry\r\nBluszco shall in your royal palace of Zajë Zaculo, amid pomp and high\r\nrejoicing, wed the young princess your cousin: most fortunate lord,\r\nthat must be lord of her whom all just censure doth acknowledge the\r\nornament of earth, the model of heaven, the queen of beauty.”\r\n\r\n“Kind Gods hasten the day,” said Gaslark. “For truly ’tis a most sweet\r\nlass, and those kinsmen of Demonland my dearest friends. But for whose\r\ngreat upholding time and again, Teshmar, in days gone by, where were\r\nI to-day and my kingdom, and where thou and all of you?” The king’s\r\nbrow darkened a little with thought. After a time he began to say, “I\r\nmust have more great action: these trivial harryings, spoils of Nevria,\r\nchasing of Esamocian black-a-moors, be toys not worthy of our great\r\nname and renown among the nations. Something I would enact that shall\r\nembroil and astonish the world, even as the Demons when they purged\r\nearth of the Ghouls, ere I go down into silence.”\r\n\r\nTeshmar was staring toward the southern bourne. He pointed with his\r\nhand: “There rideth a great ship, O king. And methinks she hath a\r\nstrange look.”\r\n\r\nGaslark gazed earnestly at her for an instant, then straightway shifted\r\nhis helm and steered towards her. He spake no more, staring ever as he\r\nsailed, marking ever as the distance lessened more and more particulars\r\nof that ship. Her silken sail fluttered in tatters from the yard; she\r\nrowed feebly, as one groping in darkness, with barely strength to stay\r\nher from drifting stern-foremost before the wind. So hung she on the\r\nsea, as one struck stupid by some blow, doubting which way her harbour\r\nlay or which way her course. As a thing which hath been held in the\r\nflame of a monstrous candle, so seemed she, singed and besmirched with\r\nsoot. Smashed was her proud figure-head, and smashed was her high\r\nforecastle, and burned and shattered the carved timbers of the poop and\r\nthe fair seats that were thereon. She leaked, so that a score of her\r\ncrew must be still a-baling to keep her afloat. Of her fifty oars, half\r\nwere broken or gone adrift, and many of the ship’s company lay wounded\r\nand some slain under her thwarts.\r\n\r\nAnd now was King Gaslark ware as he drew near that here was the Lord\r\nJuss on her ruined poop a-steering, and by him Spitfire and Brandoch\r\nDaha. Their jewelled arms and gear and rich attire were black with most\r\nstinking soot, and it was as though admiration and grief and anger were\r\nso locked and twined within them that none of these passions might win\r\nforth to outward showing on their frozen countenances.\r\n\r\nWhen they were within hailing distance, Gaslark hailed them. They\r\nanswered him not, only beholding him with alien eyes. But they stopped\r\nthe ship, and Gaslark lay aboard of her and came on board and went up\r\non the poop and greeted them. And he said, “Well met in an ill hour.\r\nWhat’s the matter?”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Juss made as if to speak, but no word came. Only he took\r\nGaslark by both hands and sat down with a great groan on the poop,\r\naverting his face. Gaslark said, “O Juss, for so many a time as thou\r\nhast borne part in my evils and succoured me, surely right requireth I\r\nhave part of thine?”\r\n\r\nBut Juss answered in a thick, strange voice all unlike himself, “Mine,\r\nsayest thou, O Gaslark? What in the stablished world is mine, that\r\nam thus in a moment reived of him that was mine own heartstring, my\r\nbrother, the might of mine arm, the chiefest citadel of my dominion?”\r\nAnd he burst into a great passion of weeping.\r\n\r\nKing Gaslark’s rings were driven into the flesh of his fingers by the\r\ngrip of Juss’s strong hands on his. But he scarce wist of the pain,\r\nsuch agony of mind was in him for the loss of his friend, and for the\r\nbitterness and wonder that it was to behold these three great lords of\r\nDemonland weep like frightened women, and all their ship’s company of\r\ntried men of war weeping and wailing besides. And Gaslark saw well that\r\ntheir lordly souls were unseated for a season because of some dreadful\r\nfact, the havoc whereof his eyes most woefully beheld, while its\r\nparticulars were yet dark to him, yet with a terror in darkness that\r\nmight well make his heart to quail.\r\n\r\nBy much questioning he was at last well advertised of what had\r\nbefallen: how they the day before, in broad noon, on such a summer sea,\r\nhad heard a noise like the flapping of wings outstretched from one\r\nedge of the sky to another, and in a moment the calm sea was lifted\r\nup and fell again and the whole sea clashed together and roared, yet\r\nwas the ship not sunken. And there was a tumult about them of thunder\r\nand raging waters and black night and wildfire in the night; which\r\npresently passing away and the darkness lifting, the sea lay solitary\r\nas far as eye might reach. “And nothing is more certain,” said Juss,\r\n“than that this is a sending of King Gorice XII. spoken of by the\r\nprophets as a great clerk of necromancy beyond all other this world\r\nhath seen. And this is his vengeance for the woes we wrought for\r\nWitchland in the Foliot Isles. Against such a peril I had provided\r\ncertain amulets made of the stone alectorian, which groweth in the\r\ngizzard of a cock hatched on a moonless night when Saturn burneth in a\r\nhuman sign and the lord of the third house is in the ascendant. These\r\nsaved us, albeit sorely buffeted, from destruction: all save Goldry\r\nalone. He, by some cursed chance, whether he neglected to wear the\r\ncharm I gave him, or the chain of it was broken in the plunging of the\r\nship, or by some other means ’twas lost: when daylight came again, we\r\nstood but three on this poop where four had stood. More I know not.”\r\n\r\n“O Gaslark,” said Spitfire, “our brother that is stolen from us, with\r\nus it surely lieth to find him and set him free.”\r\n\r\nBut Juss groaned and said, “In which star of the unclimbed sky wilt\r\nthou begin our search? Or in which of the secret streams of ocean where\r\nthe last green rays are quenched in oozy darkness?”\r\n\r\nGaslark was silent for a while. Then he said, “I think nought likelier\r\nthan this, that Gorice hath caught away Goldry Bluszco into Carcë,\r\nwhere he holdeth him in duress. And thither must we straightway to\r\ndeliver him.”\r\n\r\nJuss answered no word. But Gaslark seized his hand, saying, “Our\r\nancient love and your oft succouring of Goblinland in days gone by make\r\nthis my quarrel. Hear now my rede. As I fared from the east through\r\nthe Straits of Rinath I beheld a mighty company of forty sail, bound\r\neastward to the Beshtrian sea. Well it was they marked us not as we lay\r\nunder the isles of Ellien in the dusk of evening. For touching later at\r\nNorvasp in Pixyland we learned that there sailed Laxus with the whole\r\nWitchland fleet, being minded to work evil deeds among the peaceful\r\ncities of the Beshtrian seaboard. And as well met were an antelope\r\nwith a devouring lion, as I and my seven ships with those ill-doers in\r\nsuch strength on the high seas. But now, behold how wide standeth the\r\ndoor to our wishes. Laxus and that great armament are safe harrying\r\neastward-ho. I make question whether at this moment more than nine\r\nscore or ten score fighting men be left in Carcë. I have here of mine\r\nown nigh on five hundred. Never was fairer chance to take Witchland\r\nwith his claws beneath the table, and royally may we scratch his face\r\nere he get them forth again.” And Gaslark laughed for joy of battle,\r\nand cried, “O Juss, smiles it not to thee, this rede of mine?”\r\n\r\n“Gaslark,” said Lord Juss, “nobly and with that open hand and heart\r\nthat I have loved in thee from of old hast thou made this offer. Yet\r\nnot so is Witchland to be overcome, but after long days of labour only,\r\nand laying of schemes and building of ships and gathering of hosts\r\nanswerable to the strength we bare of late against the Ghouls when we\r\ndestroyed them.”\r\n\r\nNor for all his urging might Gaslark move him any whit.\r\n\r\nBut Spitfire sat by his brother and spake privately to him: “Kinsman,\r\nwhat ails thee? Is all high heart and swiftness to action crushed out\r\nof Demonland, and doth but the unserviceable juiceless skin remain to\r\nus? Thou art clean unlike that thou hast ever been, and could Witchland\r\nbehold us now well might he judge that base fear had ta’en hold upon\r\nus, seeing that with the odds of strength so fortunately of our side we\r\nshrink from striking at him.”\r\n\r\nJuss said in Spitfire’s ear, “This it is, that I do misdoubt me of the\r\nsteadfastness of the Goblins. Too like to fire among dead leaves is the\r\nsudden flame of their valour, a poor thing to rely on if once they be\r\nchecked. So do I count it folly trusting in them for our main strength\r\nto go up against Carcë. Also it is but a wild fancy that Goldry hath\r\nbeen transported into Carcë.”\r\n\r\nBut Spitfire leaped up a-cursing, and cried out, “O Gaslark, thou wert\r\nbest fare home to Goblinland. But we will sail openly to Carcë and\r\ncrave audience of the great King, entreating him suffer us to kiss his\r\ntoe, and acknowledging him to be our King and us his ill-conditioned,\r\ndisobedient children. So may he haply restore unto us our brother, when\r\nhe hath chastised us, and haply of his mercy send us home to Demonland,\r\nthere to fawn upon Corsus or vile Corinius, or whomsoever he shall\r\nset up in Galing for his Viceroy. For with Goldry hath all manliness\r\ndeparted out of Demonland, and we be milksops that remain, and objects\r\nof scorn and spitting.”\r\n\r\nNow while Spitfire spake thus in wrath and sorrow of heart, the Lord\r\nBrandoch Daha fared fore and aft on the gangway about and about, as a\r\ncaged panther fareth when feeding time is long overdue. And at whiles\r\nhe clapped hand to the hilt of his long and glittering sword and\r\nrattled it in the scabbard. At length, standing over against Gaslark,\r\nand eyeing him with a mocking glance, “O Gaslark,” he said, “this\r\nthat hath befallen breedeth in me a cruel perturbation which carries\r\nmy spirits outwards, stirring up a tempest in my mind and preparing\r\nmy body to melancholy, and madness itself. The cure of this is only\r\nfighting. Wherefore if thou love me, Gaslark, out with thy sword and\r\nward thyself. Fight I must, or this passion will kill me quite out.\r\n’Tis pity to draw upon my friend, but sith we be banned from fighting\r\nwith our enemies, what choice remaineth?”\r\n\r\nGaslark laughed and seized him playfully by the arms, saying, “I will\r\nnot fight with thee, how prettily soe’er thou ask it, Brandoch Daha,\r\nthat savedst Goblinland from the Witches”; but straight grew grave\r\nagain and said to Juss, “O Juss, be ruled. Thou seest what temper thy\r\nfriends are in. All we be as hounds tugging against the leash to be\r\nloosed against Carcë in this happy hour, that likely cometh not again.”\r\n\r\nNow when Lord Juss perceived them all against him, and hot-mouthed\r\nfor that attempt, he smiled scornfully and said, “O my brother and my\r\nfriends, what echoes and quail-pipes are you become who seem to catch\r\nwisdom by imitating her voice? But ye be mad like March hares, every\r\nman of you, and myself too. Break ice in one place, ’twill crack in\r\nmore. And truly I care not greatly for my life now that Goldry is\r\ngone from me. Cast we lots, then, which of us three shall fare home\r\nto Demonland with this our ship, that is but a lame duck since this\r\nsending. And he on whom the lot shall fall must fare home to concert\r\nthe raising of a mighty fleet and armament to carry on our war against\r\nthe Witches.”\r\n\r\nSo spake Lord Juss, and all they who had but a short hour ago\r\nfelt themselves in such point that there was in them no hope of\r\nconvalescence nor of life, had now their spirits raised in a seeming\r\ndrunkenness, and thought only on the gladness of battle.\r\n\r\nThe lords of Demonland marked each his lot and cast it in the helm of\r\nGaslark, and Gaslark shook the helm, and there leapt forth the lot of\r\nthe Lord Spitfire. Right wrathful was he. So the lords of Demonland did\r\noff their armour and their costly apparel that was black with soot, and\r\nlet cleanse it. Sixty of their fighting men that were unscathed by the\r\nsending went aboard one of Gaslark’s ships, and the crew of that ship\r\nmanned the ship of Demonland, and Spitfire took the steering paddle,\r\nand the Demons that were hurt lay in the hold of the hollow ship. They\r\nbrought forth a spare sail and hoisted it in place of that that was\r\ndestroyed; so in sore discontent, yet with a cheerful countenance, the\r\nLord Spitfire set sail for the west. And Gaslark the king sat by the\r\nsteering paddle of his fair dragon of war, and by him the Lord Juss and\r\nthe Lord Brandoch Daha, who was like a war-horse impatient for battle.\r\nHer prow swung north and so round eastaway, and her sail broidered\r\nwith flower-de-luces smote the mast and filled to the north-west wind,\r\nand those other six fared after her in line ahead with white sails\r\nunfurled, striding majestic over the full broad billows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      VI: THE CLAWS OF WITCHLAND\r\n\r\n  OF KING GASLARK’S LEADING IN THE ATTEMPT ON CARCË IN THE DARK, AND\r\n      HOW HE PROSPERED THEREIN, AND OF THE GREAT STAND OF LORD JUSS\r\n      AND LORD BRANDOCH DAHA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the third day, whenas they drew near to within\r\nsight of the Witchland coast, they brailed up their sails and waited\r\nfor the night, that so they might make the landfall after dark; for\r\nlittle to their mind it was that the King should have news of their\r\nfarings. This was their plan, to beach their ships on the lonely shore\r\nsome two leagues north of Tenemos, whence it was but two hours’ march\r\nacross the fen to Carcë. So when the sun set and all the ways were\r\ndarkened they muffled their oars and rowed silently to the low shore\r\nthat showed strangely near in the darkness, yet ever seemed to flee and\r\nkeep its distance as they rowed toward it. Coming at length ashore,\r\nthey drew their ships up on the beach. Some fifty men of the Goblins\r\nthey left to guard the ships, while the rest took their weapons. And\r\nwhen they were marshalled they marched inland over the sand-dunes and\r\nso on to the open fen; and seeing that the most of them by far were of\r\nGoblinland, it was agreed between those three, Juss, Brandoch Daha, and\r\nGaslark, that Gaslark should have command of this emprise. So fared\r\nthey silently across the marshes, that were firm enough for marching so\r\nit were done circumspectly, rounding the worst moss-hags and the small\r\nlochs that were scattered here and there. For the weather had been fine\r\nfor a season, and little new water stood on the marsh. But as they drew\r\nnear to Carcë the weather worsened and fine rain began to fall. And\r\nalbeit there was little comfort marching through the drizzling murk of\r\nnight towards that fortress of evil name, yet was Lord Juss glad at the\r\nrain, since it favoured surprise, and on surprise hung all their hopes.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle night they halted within four hundred paces of the\r\nouter walls of Carcë, that loomed ghostly through the watery curtain,\r\nsilent as it had been a tomb where Witchland lay in death, rather than\r\nthe mailed shell wherein so great a power sat waiting. The sight of\r\nthat vast bulk couched shadowy in the rain lighted the fire of battle\r\nin the breast of Gaslark, nor would aught please him save that they\r\nshould go forthwith up to the walls with all their force, and so march\r\nround them seeking where they might break suddenly in and seize the\r\nplace. Nor would he listen to the counsel of Lord Juss, who would send\r\nforth detachments to select a spot for assault and bring back word\r\nbefore the whole force advanced. “Be sure,” said Gaslark, “that they\r\nwithin are all foxed and cupshotten the third night with swilling of\r\nwine, in honour of such triumph as he hath gotten by his sending, and\r\nbut a sorry watch is kept on such a night. For who, say they, shall\r\ncome up against Carcë now that the power of Demonland is stricken in\r\npieces? The scorned Goblins, ha? A motion for laughter and derision.\r\nBut thine advance guard might give them warning or ever our main force\r\ncould seize the occasion. Nay, but as the Ghouls in an evil day coming\r\nsuddenly upon me in Zajë Zaculo gat my palace taken ere we were well\r\nware of their coming, so must we take this hold of Carcë. And if thou\r\nfearest a sally, right hotly do I desire it. For if they open the gate\r\nwe are enough to force an entry in despite of any numbers they are like\r\nto have within.”\r\n\r\nNow Juss thought ill of this counsel, yet, for a strange languor that\r\nstill hung about his wits, he would not gainsay Gaslark. So crept they\r\nin stealth near to the great walls of Carcë. Softly ever fell the rain,\r\nand breathless stood the cypresses within the outer ward, and blank and\r\ndumb and untenanted frowned the black marble walls of that sleeping\r\ncastle. And dour midnight waited over all.\r\n\r\nNow Gaslark issued command, bidding them march warily round the walls\r\nnorthward, for no way was betwixt the lofty walls and the river on the\r\nsouth and east, but to the north-east was he hopeful to find a likely\r\nplace to win into the hold. In such order went they that Gaslark with\r\nan hundred of his ablest men led the van, and after him came the\r\nDemons. The main strength of the Goblins followed after, with Teshmar\r\nfor their captain. Warily they marched, and now were they on the rising\r\nground that ran back north and west from the bluff of Carcë to the fen.\r\nFull eager were they of Goblinland and flown with the intoxication of\r\nimpending battle, and they of the vanguard fared apace, outstripping\r\nthe Demons, so that Juss was fain to hasten after them lest they should\r\nlose touch and fall to confusion. But Teshmar’s men feared greatly to\r\nbe left behind, nor might he hold them back, but they must run betwixt\r\nthe Demons and the walls, meaning to join with Gaslark. Juss swore\r\nunder his breath, saying, “See the unruly rabble of Goblinland. And\r\nthey will yet be our undoing.”\r\n\r\nIn such case stood they, nor were Teshmar’s folk more than twenty paces\r\nfrom the walls, when, sudden as night-lightning, flares were kindled\r\nalong the walls, dazzling the Goblins and the Demons and brightly\r\nlighting them for those that manned the walls, who fell a-shooting\r\nat them with spears and arrows and a-slinging of stones. In the same\r\nmoment opened a postern gate, whence sallied forth the Lord Corinius\r\nwith an hundred and fifty stout lads of Witchland, shouting, “He that\r\nwould sup of the crab of Witchland must deal with the nippers ere he\r\nessay the shell”; and charging Gaslark’s army in the flank he cut them\r\nclean in two. As one wood fared forth Corinius, smiting on either\r\nhand with a two-edged axe with heft lapped with bronze; and greatly\r\nthough the folk of Gaslark outnumbered him, yet were they so taken at\r\nunawares and confounded by the sudden onslaught of Corinius that they\r\nmight not abide him but everywhere gave ground before his onslaught.\r\nAnd many were wounded and some were slain; and with these Teshmar of\r\nGoblinland, the master of Gaslark’s ship. For smiting at Corinius and\r\nmissing of his aim he louted forward with the blow, and Corinius hewed\r\nat him with his axe and the blow came on Teshmar’s neck and so hewed\r\noff his head. Now Gaslark with the best of his fighting men was come\r\nsome way past the postern, but whenas they fell to fighting he turned\r\nback straightway to meet Corinius, calling loudly on his men to rally\r\nagainst the Witches and drive them back within the walls. So when\r\nGaslark was gotten through the press to within reach of Corinius, he\r\nthrust at Corinius with a spear, wounding him in the arm. But Corinius\r\nsmote the spear-shaft asunder with his axe, and leapt upon Gaslark,\r\ngiving him a great wound on the shoulder. And Gaslark took to his\r\nsword, and many blows they bandied that made either stagger, till\r\nCorinius struck Gaslark on the helm a great down-stroke of his axe,\r\nas one driveth a pile with a wooden mallet. And because of the good\r\nhelm he wore, given by Lord Juss in days gone by as a gift of love and\r\nfriendship, was Gaslark saved and his head not cloven asunder; for on\r\nthat helm Corinius’s axe might not bite. Yet with that great stroke\r\nwere Gaslark’s senses driven forth of him for a season, so that he fell\r\nsenseless to the earth. And with his fall came dismay upon them of\r\nGoblinland.\r\n\r\nAll this befell in the first brunt of the battle, nor were the lords\r\nof Demonland yet fully joined in the mellay, for the great press of\r\nGaslark’s men were between them and the Witches; but now Juss and\r\nBrandoch Daha went forth mightily with their following, and took up\r\nGaslark that lay like one dead, and Juss bade a company of the Goblins\r\nbear him to the ships, and there was he bestowed safe and sound. But\r\nthe Witches shouted loudly that King Gaslark was slain; and at this\r\nchosen time Corund, that was come privily forth of a hidden door on the\r\nwestern side of Carcë with fifty men, took the Goblins mightily in the\r\nrear. So they, still falling back before Corinius and Corund, and their\r\nhearts sick at the supposed slaying of Gaslark, waxed full of doubt and\r\ndejection; for in the watery darkness they might nowise perceive by\r\nhow much they outwent in numbers the men of Witchland. And panic took\r\nthem, so that they broke and fled before the Witches, that came after\r\nthem resolute, as a stoat holdeth by a rabbit, and slew them by scores\r\nand by fifties as they fled from Carcë. Scarce three score men of that\r\nbrave company of Goblinland that went up with Gaslark against Carcë\r\nwon away into the marshes and came to their ships, escaping pitiless\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nBut Corund and Corinius and their main force turned without more ado\r\nagainst the Demons, and bitter was the battle that befell betwixt them,\r\nand great the clatter of their blows. And now were the odds clean\r\nchanged about with the putting of the Goblins out of the battle, since\r\nbut few of Witchland were fallen, and they were as four to one against\r\nthe Demons, hemming them in and having at them from every side. And\r\nsome shot at them from the wall, until a chance shot came that was like\r\nto have stove in Corund’s helm, who straightway sent word that when\r\nthe rout was ended he would make lark-pies of the cow-headed doddipole\r\nwhosoever he might be that had set them thus a-shooting, spoiling sport\r\nfor their comrades and dangering their lives. Therewith ceased the\r\nshooting from the wall.\r\n\r\nAnd now grim and woundsome grew the battle, for the Demons mightily\r\nwithstood the onset of the Witches, and the Lord Brandoch Daha rushed\r\nwith an onslaught ever and anon upon Corund or upon Corinius, nor might\r\neither of those great captains bear up long against him, but every\r\ntime gave back before Lord Brandoch Daha; and bitterly cursed they one\r\nanother as each in turn was fain to save himself amid the press of\r\ntheir fighting men. Nor could one hope in one night’s space to behold\r\nsuch deeds of derring-do as were done that night by Lord Brandoch Daha,\r\nthat played his sword lightly as one handleth a willow wand; yet death\r\nsat on the point thereof. In such wise that eleven stout sworders of\r\nWitchland were slain by him, and fifteen besides were sorely wounded.\r\nAnd at the last, Corinius, stung by Corund’s taunts as by a gadfly,\r\nand well nigh bursting for grief and shame at his ill speeding, leapt\r\nupon Lord Brandoch Daha as one reft of his wits, aiming at him a great\r\ntwo-handed blow that was apt enough to cleave him to the brisket. But\r\nBrandoch Daha slipped from the blow lightly as a kingfisher flying\r\nabove an alder-shadowed stream avoideth a branch in his flight, and\r\nran Corinius through the right wrist with his sword. And straight was\r\nCorinius put out of the fight. Nor had they greater satisfaction that\r\nwent against Lord Juss, who mowed at them with great swashing blows,\r\nbeheading some and hewing some asunder in the midst, till they were\r\nfain to keep clear of his reaping. So fought the Demons in the glare\r\nand watery mist, greatly against great odds, until all were smitten to\r\nearth save those two lords alone, Juss and Brandoch Daha.\r\n\r\nNow stood King Gorice on the outer battlements of Carcë, all armed in\r\nhis black armour inlaid with gold; and he beheld those twain how they\r\nfought back to back, and how the Witches beset them on every side yet\r\nnowise might prevail against them. And the King said unto Gro that was\r\nby him on the wall, “Mine eyes dazzle in the mist and torchlight. What\r\nbe these that maintain so bloody an advantage upon my kemperie-men?”\r\n\r\nGro answered him, “Surely, O King, these be none other than Lord Juss\r\nand Lord Brandoch Daha of Krothering.”\r\n\r\nThe King said, “So by degrees cometh my sending home to me. For by my\r\nart I have intelligence, albeit not certainly, that Goldry was taken\r\nby my sending; so have I my desire on him I hold most in hate. And\r\nthese, saved by their enchantments from like ruin, have been driven mad\r\nto rush into the open mouth of my vengeance.” And when he had gazed\r\nawhile, the King sneered and said unto Gro, “A sweet sight, to behold\r\nan hundred of my ablest men flinch and duck before these twain. Till\r\nnow methought there was a sword in Witchland, and methought Corinius\r\nand Corund not simple braggarts without power or heart, as here\r\nappeareth, since like boys well birched they do cringe from the shining\r\nswords of Juss and the vile upstart from Krothering.”\r\n\r\nBut Corinius, who stood no longer in the battle but by the King, full\r\nof spleen and his wrist all bloody, cried out, “You do us wrong, O\r\nKing. Juster it were to praise my great deed in ambushing this mighty\r\ncompany of our enemies and putting them all to the slaughter. And if\r\nI prevailed not against this Brandoch Daha your majesty needs not to\r\nmarvel, since a greater than I, Gorice X. of memory ever glorious,\r\nwas lightly conquered by him. Wherein methinks I am the luckier, to\r\nhave but a gored wrist and not my death. As for these twain, they be\r\nstick-frees, on whom no point or edge may bite. And nought were more to\r\nbe looked for, since we deal with such a sorcerer as this Juss.”\r\n\r\n“Rather,” said the King, “are ye all grown milksops. But I have no\r\nfurther stomach for this interlude, but straight will end it.”\r\n\r\nTherewith the King called to him the old Duke Corsus, bidding him take\r\nnets and catch the Demons therein. And Corsus, faring forth with nets,\r\nby sheer weight of numbers and with the death of near a score of the\r\nWitches at length gat this performed, and Lord Juss and Lord Brandoch\r\nDaha well tangled in the nets, and lapped about as silkworms in their\r\ncocoons, and so drawn into Carcë. Soundly were they bumped along the\r\nground, and glad enow were the Witches to have gotten those great\r\nfighters scotched at last. For utterly spent were Corund and his men,\r\nand fain to drop for very weariness.\r\n\r\nSo when they were gotten into Carcë, the King let search with torches\r\nand bring in them of Witchland that lay hurt before the walls; and any\r\nDemons or Goblins that were happed upon in like case he let slay with\r\nthe sword. And the Lord Juss and the Lord Brandoch Daha, still lapped\r\ntightly in their nets, he let fling into a corner of the inner court of\r\nthe palace like two bales of damaged goods, and set a guard upon them\r\nuntil morning.\r\n\r\nAs the lords of Witchland were upon going to bed they beheld westward\r\nby the sea a red glow, and tongues of fire burning in the night.\r\nCorinius said unto Lord Gro, “Lo where thy Goblins burn their ships,\r\nlest we pursue them as they flee shamefully homeward in the ship they\r\nkeep from the burning. One ship sufficeth, for most of them be dead.”\r\n\r\nAnd Corinius betook him sleepily to bed, pausing on the way to kick at\r\nthe Lord Brandoch Daha, that lay safely swathed in his net powerless as\r\nthen to do him harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   VII: GUESTS OF THE KING IN CARCË\r\n\r\n  OF THE TWO BANQUET HALLS THAT WERE IN CARCË, THE OLD AND THE NEW,\r\n      AND OF THE ENTERTAINMENT GIVEN BY KING GORICE XII. IN THE ONE\r\n      HALL TO LORD JUSS AND LORD BRANDOCH DAHA AND IN THE OTHER\r\n      TO THE PRINCE LA FIREEZ; AND OF THEIR LEAVE-TAKING WHEN THE\r\n      BANQUET WAS DONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morrow of that battle dawned fair on Carcë. Folk lay long abed\r\nafter their toil, and until the sun was high nought stirred before the\r\nwalls. But toward noon came forth a band sent by King Gorice to bring\r\nin the spoil; and they took up the bodies of the slain and laid them\r\nin howe on the right bank of the river Druima half a mile below Carcë,\r\nWitches, Demons, and Goblins in one grave together, and raised up a\r\ngreat howe over them.\r\n\r\nNow was the sun’s heat strong, but the shadow of the great keep\r\nrested still on the terrace without the western wall of the palace.\r\nCool and redolent of ease and soft repose was that terrace, paved\r\nwith flagstones of red jasper, with spleenwort, assafoetida, livid\r\ntoadstools, dragons’ teeth, and bitter moon-seed growing in the joints.\r\nOn the outer edge of the terrace were bushes of arbor vitae planted in\r\na row, squat and round like sleeping dormice, with clumps of choke-pard\r\naconite in the interspaces. Many hundred feet in length was the terrace\r\nfrom north to south, and at either end a flight of black marble steps\r\nled down to the level of the inner ward and its embattled wall.\r\n\r\nBenches of green jasper massily built and laden with velvet cushions\r\nof many colours stood against the palace wall facing to the west, and\r\non the bench nearest the Iron Tower a lady sat at ease, eating cream\r\nwafers and a quince tart served by her waiting-women in dishes of pale\r\ngold for her morning meal. Tall was that lady and slender, and beauty\r\ndwelt in her as the sunshine dwells in the red floor and gray-green\r\ntrunks of a beech wood in early spring. Her tawny hair was gathered\r\nin deep folds upon her head and made fast by great silver pins, their\r\nheads set with anachite diamonds. Her gown was of cloth of silver with\r\na knotted cord-work of black silk embroidery everywhere decked with\r\nlittle moonstones, and over it she wore a mantle of figured satin the\r\ncolour of the wood-pigeon’s wing, tinselled and overcast with silver\r\nthreads. White-skinned she was, and graceful as an antelope. Her eyes\r\nwere green, with yellow fiery gleams. Daintily she ate the tart and\r\nwafers, sipping at whiles from a cup of amber, artificially carved,\r\nwhite wine cool from the cellars below Carcë; and a maiden sitting at\r\nher feet played on a seven-stringed lute, singing very sweetly this\r\nsong:\r\n\r\n    Aske me no more where Jove bestowes,\r\n    When June is past, the fading rose;\r\n    For in your beautie’s orient deepe,\r\n    These flowers, as in their causes, sleepe.\r\n\r\n    Aske me no more whether doth stray\r\n    The golden atomes of the day;\r\n    For in pure love heaven did prepare\r\n    Those powders to inrich your haire.\r\n\r\n    Aske me no more whether doth hast\r\n    The nightingale when May is past;\r\n    For in your sweet dividing throat\r\n    She winters and keepes warme her note.\r\n\r\n    Aske me no more where those starres light,\r\n    That downewards fall in dead of night;\r\n    For in your eyes they sit, and there\r\n    Fixed become as in their sphere.\r\n\r\n    Aske me no more if east or west\r\n    The Phenix builds her spicy nest;\r\n    For unto you at last shee flies,\r\n    And in your fragrant bosome dyes.\r\n\r\n“No more,” said the lady; “thy voice is cracked this morning. Is none\r\nabroad yet thou canst find to tell me of last night’s doings? Or are\r\nall gone my lord’s gate, that I left sleeping still as though all the\r\npoppies of all earth’s gardens breathed drowsiness about his head?”\r\n\r\n“One cometh, madam,” said the damosel.\r\n\r\nThe lady said, “The Lord Gro. He may resolve me. Though were he in the\r\nstour last night, that were a wonder indeed.”\r\n\r\nTherewith came Gro along the terrace from the north, clad in a mantle\r\nof dun-coloured velvet with a collar of raised work of gold upon silver\r\npurl; and his long black curly beard was perfumed with orange-flower\r\nwater and angelica. When they had greeted one another and the lady had\r\nbidden her women stand apart, she said, “My lord, I thirst for tidings.\r\nRecount to me all that befell since sundown. For I slept soundly till\r\nthe streaks of morning showed through my chamber windows, and then\r\nI awoke from a flying dream of sennets sounding to the onset, and\r\ntorches in the night, and war’s alarums. And there were torches indeed\r\nin my chamber lighting my lord to bed, that answered me no word but\r\nstraightway fell asleep as in utter weariness. Some slight scratches he\r\nhath, but else unhurt. I would not wake him, for balm is in slumber;\r\nalso is he ill to do with if one wake him so. But the tattle and wild\r\nsurmise of the servants bloweth as ever to all points of wonder: as\r\nthat a great armament of Demonland is disembarked at Tenemos, and\r\nall routed last night by my lord and by Corinius, and Goldry Bluszco\r\nslain in single combat with the King. Or that Juss hath set a charm\r\non Laxus and all our fleet, making them sail like parricides against\r\nthis land, Juss and the other Demons leading them; and all slain save\r\nLaxus and Goldry Bluszco, but these brought bound into Carcë, stark\r\nmad and frothing at the lips, and Corinius dead of his wounds after\r\nslaying of Brandoch Daha. Or, foolishly,” and her green eyes lightened\r\ndangerously, “that it was my brother risen in revolt to wrest Pixyland\r\nfrom the overlordship of Gorice, and joined with Gaslark to that end,\r\nand their army overthrown and both ta’en prisoner.”\r\n\r\nGro laughed and said, “Surely, O my Lady Prezmyra, truth masketh in\r\nmany a strange disguise when she rideth rumour’s broomstick through\r\nkings’ palaces. But somewhat of herself hath she shown thee, if thou\r\nconclude that an event was brought to birth betwixt dark and sunrise to\r\nstagger the world, and that the power of Witchland bloomed forth this\r\nnight into unbeholden glory.”\r\n\r\n“Thou speakest big, my lord,” said the lady. “Were the Demons in it?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, madam,” he said.\r\n\r\n“And triumphed on? and slain?”\r\n\r\n“All slain save Juss and Brandoch Daha, and they taken,” said Gro.\r\n\r\n“Was this my lord’s doing?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Greatly, as I think,” said Gro; “though Corinius claimeth for himself,\r\nas commonly, the main honour of it.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra said, “He claimeth overmuch.” And she said, “There were none\r\nin it save Demons?”\r\n\r\nGro, knowing her thought, smiled and made answer, “Madam, there were\r\nWitches.”\r\n\r\n“My Lord Gro,” she cried, “thou dost ill to mock me. Thou art my\r\nfriend. Thou knowest the Prince my brother proud and sudden to anger.\r\nThou knowest it chafeth him to have Witchland over him. Thou knowest\r\nthe time is many days overpast when he should bring his yearly tribute\r\nto the King.”\r\n\r\nGro’s great ox-eyes were soft as he looked upon the Lady Prezmyra,\r\nsaying, “Most assuredly am I thy friend, madam. Belike, if truth were\r\ntold, thou and thy lord are all the true friends I have in waterish\r\nWitchland: you two, and the King: but who sleepeth safe in the favour\r\nof kings? Ah, madam, none of Pixyland stood in the battle yesternight.\r\nTherefore let thy soul be at ease. But my task it was, standing on the\r\nbattlements beside the King, to smile and smile while Corinius and our\r\nfighting men made a bloody havoc of four or five hundred of mine own\r\nkinsfolk.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra caught her breath and was silent a moment. Then, “Gaslark?”\r\n\r\n“The main force was his, it appeareth,” answered Lord Gro. “Corinius\r\nbraggeth himself his banesman, and certain it is he felled him to\r\nearth. But I am secretly advertised he was not among the dead taken up\r\nthis morning.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” she said, “my desire for news drinks deep while thou art\r\nfasting. Some, bring meat and wine for my Lord Gro.” And two damosels\r\nran and returned with sparkling golden wine in a beaker, and a dish of\r\nlampreys with hippocras sauce. So Gro sat him down on the jasper bench\r\nand, while he ate and drank, rehearsed to the Lady Prezmyra the doings\r\nof the night.\r\n\r\nWhen he had ended she said, “How hath the King dealt with those twain,\r\nLord Juss and Lord Brandoch Daha?”\r\n\r\nGro answered, “He hath them clapped up in the old banqueting hall in\r\nthe Iron Tower.” And his brow darkened, and he said, “’Tis pity thy\r\nlord lay thus long abed, and so came not to the council, where Corsus\r\nand Corinius, backed by thy step-sons and the sons of Corsus, egged\r\non the King to use shamefully these lords of Demonland. True is that\r\ndistich which admonisheth us—\r\n\r\n    Know when to speak, for many times it brings\r\n    Danger to give the best advice to Kings;\r\n\r\nand little for my health, and little gain withal, had it been had I\r\nthen openly withstood them. Corinius is ever watchful to fling Goblin\r\nin my teeth. But Corund weigheth in their councils as his hand weigheth\r\nin battle.”\r\n\r\nNow as Gro spake came the Lord Corund on the terrace, calling for still\r\nwine to cool his throat withal. Prezmyra poured forth to him: “Thou\r\nart blamed to me for keeping thy bed, my lord, that shouldst have been\r\ndevising with the King touching our enemies ta’en captive in this night\r\ngone by.”\r\n\r\nCorund sat by his lady on the bench and drank. “If that be all, madam,”\r\nsaid he, “then have I little to charge my conscience withal. For nought\r\nlies readier than strike off their heads, and so bring all to a fit and\r\nhappy ending.”\r\n\r\n“Far otherwise,” said Gro, “hath the King determined. He let drag\r\nbefore him Lord Juss and Lord Brandoch Daha, and with many fleers\r\nand jibes, ‘Welcome,’ he saith, ‘to Carcë. Your table shall not lack\r\nstore of delicates while ye are my guests; albeit ye come unbidden.’\r\nTherewith he let drag them to the old banquet hall. And he bade his\r\nsmiths drive great iron staples into the wall, whereon he let hang up\r\nthe Demons by their wrists, spread-eagled against the wall, making both\r\nwrists and ankles fast to the staples with gyves of iron. And the King\r\nlet dight the table before their feet as for a banquet, that the sight\r\nand the savour might torment them. And he called all us of his council\r\nthither that we might praise his conceit and mock them anew.”\r\n\r\nSaid Prezmyra, “A great king should rather be a dog that killeth clean,\r\nthan a cat that patteth and sporteth with his prey.”\r\n\r\n“True it is,” said Corund, “that they were safer slain.” He rose from\r\nhis seat. “’Twere not amiss,” he said, “that I had word with the King.”\r\n\r\n“Wherefore so?” asked Prezmyra.\r\n\r\n“He that sleepeth late,” said Corund, eyeing her humorously, “sometimes\r\nhath news for her that riseth betimes to sit on the western terrace.\r\nAnd this was I come to tell thee, that I but now beheld eastward from\r\nour chamber window, riding toward Carcë out of Pixyland down the Way of\r\nKings——”\r\n\r\n“La Fireez?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Mine eyes be strong enow and clear enow,” said Corund, “but thou’dst\r\nscarce require me swear to mine own brother at three miles’ distance.\r\nAnd as for thine, I leave thee the swearing.”\r\n\r\n“Who should ride down the Way of Kings from Pixyland,” cried Prezmyra,\r\n“but La Fireez?”\r\n\r\n“That, madam, let Echo answer thee,” said Corund. “And it sticketh in\r\nmy mind, that the Prince my brother-in-law is one that tieth to his\r\nheartstrings the remembrance of past benefits. This too, that none did\r\nhim ever a greater benefit than Juss, that saved his life six winters\r\nback in Impland the More. Wherefore, if La Fireez be to share our\r\nrevels this night, needful it is that the King command these gabblers\r\nto keep silence touching our entertainment of these lords in the old\r\nbanquet hall, and in general touching the share of Demonland in this\r\nfighting.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra said, “Come, I’ll go with thee.”\r\n\r\nThey found the King on the topmost battlements above the water-gate\r\nwith his lords about him, gazing eastaway toward the long low hills\r\nbeyond which lay Pixyland. But when Corund began to open his mind\r\nto the King, the King said, “Thou growest old, O Corund, and like a\r\ngood-for-nothing chapman bringest not thy wares to market ere the\r\nmarket be done. I have already ta’en order for this, and straitly\r\ncharged my people that nought befell last night save a faring of the\r\nGoblins against Carcë, and their overthrow, and my chasing of them with\r\na great slaughter into the sea. Whoso by speech or sign shall reveal to\r\nLa Fireez that the Demons were in it, or that these enemies of mine are\r\nthus entertained by me to their discomfort in the old banquet hall, he\r\nshall lose nothing but his life.”\r\n\r\nCorund said, “It is well, O King.”\r\n\r\nThe King said, “Captain general, what is our strength?”\r\n\r\nCorinius answered, “Seventy and three were slain, and the others for\r\nthe most part hurt: I among them, that am thus one-handed for the\r\nwhile. I will not engage to find you, O King, fifty sound men in Carcë.”\r\n\r\n“My Lord Corund,” said the King, “thine eyes pierced ever a league\r\nbeyond the best among us, young or old. How many makest thou yon\r\ncompany?”\r\n\r\nCorund leaned on the parapet and shaded his eyes with his hand that\r\nwas broad as a smoked haddock and covered on the back with yellow\r\nhairs growing somewhat sparsely, as the hairs on the skin of a young\r\nelephant. “He rideth with three score horse, O King. One or two more\r\nI give you for good luck, but if a have a horseman fewer than sixty,\r\nnever love me more.”\r\n\r\nThe King muttered an imprecation. “It is the curse of chance bringeth\r\nhim thus pat when I have my powers abroad and am left with too little\r\nstrength to awe him if he prove irksome. One of thy sons, O Corund,\r\nshall take horse and ride south to Zorn and Permio and muster a few\r\nscore fighting men from the herdsmen and farmers with what speed he\r\nmay. It is commanded.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow was the afternoon wearing to evening when the Prince La Fireez\r\nwas come in with all his company, and greetings done, and the tribute\r\nsafe bestowed, and sleeping room appointed for him and his. And now\r\nwere all gathered together in the great banquet hall that was built by\r\nGorice XI., when he was first made King, in the south-east corner of\r\nthe palace; and it far exceeded in greatness and magnificence the old\r\nhall where Lord Juss and Lord Brandoch Daha were held in duress. Seven\r\nequal walls it had, of dark green jasper, specked with bloody spots.\r\nIn the midst of one wall was the lofty doorway, and in the walls right\r\nand left of this and in those that inclosed the angle opposite the door\r\nwere great windows placed high, giving light to the banquet hall. In\r\neach of the seven angles of the wall a caryatide, cut in the likeness\r\nof a three-headed giant from ponderous blocks of black serpentine,\r\nbowed beneath the mass of a monstrous crab hewn out of the same stone.\r\nThe mighty claws of those seven crabs spreading upwards bare up the\r\ndome of the roof, that was smooth and covered all over with paintings\r\nof battles and hunting scenes and wrastling bouts in dark and smoky\r\ncolours answerable to the gloomy grandeur of that chamber. On the walls\r\nbeneath the windows gleamed weapons of war and of the chase, and on the\r\ntwo blind walls were nailed up all orderly the skulls and dead bones\r\nof those champions which had wrastled aforetime with King Gorice XI.\r\nor ever he appointed in an evil hour to wrastle with Goldry Bluszco.\r\nAcross the innermost angle facing the door was a long table and a\r\ncarven bench behind it, and from the two ends of that table, set square\r\nwith it, two other tables yet longer and benches by them on the sides\r\nnext the wall stretched to within a short space of the door. Midmost of\r\nthe table to the right of the door was a high seat of old cypress wood,\r\ngreat and fair, with cushions of black velvet broidered with gold, and\r\nfacing it at the opposite table another high seat, smaller, and the\r\ncushions of it sewn with silver. In the space betwixt the tables five\r\niron braziers, massive and footed with claws like an eagle’s, stood in\r\na row, and behind the benches on either side were nine great stands for\r\nflamboys to light the hall by night, and seven behind the cross bench,\r\nset at equal distances and even with the walls. The floor was paved\r\nwith steatite, white and creamy, with veins of rich brown and black and\r\npurple and splashes of scarlet. The tables resting on great trestles\r\nwere massy slabs of a dusky polished stone, powdered with sparks of\r\ngold as small as atoms.\r\n\r\nThe women sat on the cross-bench, and midmost of them the Lady\r\nPrezmyra, who outwent the rest in beauty and queenliness as Venus the\r\nlesser planets of the night. Zenambria, wife to Duke Corsus, sat on her\r\nleft, and on her right Sriva, daughter to Corsus, strangely fair for\r\nsuch a father. On the upper bench, to the right of the door, the lords\r\nof Witchland sat above and below the King’s high seat, clad in holiday\r\nattire, and they of Pixyland had place over against them on the lower\r\nbench. The high seat on the lower bench was set apart for La Fireez.\r\nGreat plates and dishes of gold and silver and painted porcelain were\r\nset in order on the tables, laden with delicacies. Harps and bagpipes\r\nstruck up a barbaric music, and the guests rose to their feet, as the\r\nshining doors swung open and Gorice the King followed by the Prince his\r\nguest entered that hall.\r\n\r\nLike a black eagle surveying earth from some high mountain the King\r\npassed by in his majesty. His byrny was of black chain mail, its\r\ncollar, sleeves, and skirt edged with plates of dull gold set with\r\nhyacinths and black opals. His hose were black, cross-gartered with\r\nbands of sealskin trimmed with diamonds. On his left thumb was his\r\ngreat signet ring fashioned in gold in the semblance of the worm\r\nOuroboros that eateth his own tail: the bezel of the ring the head of\r\nthe worm, made of a peach-coloured ruby of the bigness of a sparrow’s\r\negg. His cloak was woven of the skins of black cobras stitched together\r\nwith gold wire, its lining of black silk sprinkled with dust of gold.\r\nThe iron crown of Witchland weighed on his brow, the claws of the crab\r\nerect like horns; and the sheen of its jewels was many-coloured like\r\nthe rays of Sirius on a clear night of frost and wind at Yule-tide.\r\n\r\nThe Prince La Fireez went in a mantle of black sendaline sprinkled\r\neverywhere with spangles of gold, and the tunic beneath it of rich\r\nfigured silk dyed deep purple of the Pasque flower. From the golden\r\ncirclet on his head two wings sprung aloft exquisitely fashioned in\r\nplates of beaten copper veneered with jewels and enamels and plated\r\nwith precious metals to the semblance of the wings of the oleander\r\nhawk-moth. He was something below the common height, but stout and\r\nstrong and sturdily knit, with red crisp curly hair, broad-faced and\r\nruddy, clean-shaved, with high wide-nostrilled nose and bushy red heavy\r\neyebrows, whence his eyes, most like his lady sister’s, sea-green and\r\nfiery, shot glances like a lion’s.\r\n\r\nWhen the King was come into his high seat, with Corund and Corinius\r\non his left and right in honour of their great deeds of arms, and La\r\nFireez facing him in the high seat on the lower bench, the thralls\r\nmade haste to set forth dishes of pickled grigs and oysters in the\r\nshell, and whilks, snails, and cockles fried in olive oil and swimming\r\nin red and white hippocras. And the feasters delayed not to fall to\r\non these dainties, while the cup-bearer bore round a mighty bowl of\r\nbeaten gold filled with sparkling wine the hue of the yellow sapphire,\r\nand furnished with six golden ladles resting their handles in six\r\nhalf-moon shaped nicks in the rim of that great bowl. Each guest when\r\nthe bowl was brought to him must brim his goblet with the ladle, and\r\ndrink unto the glory of Witchland and the rulers thereof.\r\n\r\nSomewhat greenly looked Corinius on the Prince, and whispering Heming,\r\nCorund’s son, in the ear, who sat next him, he said, “True it is that\r\nLa Fireez is the showiest of men in all that belongeth to gear and\r\ncostly array. Mark with what ridiculous excess he affecteth Demonland\r\nin the great store of jewels he flaunteth, and with what an apish\r\ninsolence he sitteth at the board. Yet this lobcock liveth only by our\r\nsufferance, and I see a hath not forgot to bring with him to Witchland\r\nthe price of our hand withheld from twisting of his neck.”\r\n\r\nNow were borne round dishes of carp, pilchards, and lobsters, and\r\nthereafter store enow of meats: a fat kid roasted whole and garnished\r\nwith peas on a spacious silver charger, kid pasties, plates of neats’\r\ntongues and sweetbreads, sucking rabbits in jellies, hedgehogs baked\r\nin their skins, hogs’ haslets, carbonadoes, chitterlings, and dormouse\r\npies. These and other luscious meats were borne round continually by\r\nthralls who moved silent on bare feet; and merry waxed the talk as the\r\nedge of hunger became blunted a little, and the cockles of men’s hearts\r\nwere warmed with wine.\r\n\r\n“What news in Witchland?” asked La Fireez.\r\n\r\n“I have heard nought newer,” said the King, “than the slaying of\r\nGaslark.” And the King recounted the battle in the night, setting forth\r\nas in a frank and open honesty every particular of numbers, times, and\r\ncomings and goings; save that none might have guessed from his tale\r\nthat any of Demonland had part or interest in that battle.\r\n\r\nLa Fireez said, “Strange it is that he should so attack you. An enemy\r\nmight smell some cause behind it.”\r\n\r\n“Our greatness,” said Corinius, looking haughtily at him, “is a lamp\r\nwhereat other moths than he have been burnt. I count it no strange\r\nmatter at all.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra said, “Strange indeed, were it any but Gaslark. But sure with\r\nhim no wild sudden fancy were too light but it should chariot him like\r\nthistle-down to storm heaven itself.”\r\n\r\n“A bubble of the air, madam: all fine colours without and empty wind\r\nwithin. I have known other such,” said Corinius, still resting his gaze\r\nwith studied insolence on the Prince.\r\n\r\nPrezmyra’s eye danced. “O my Lord Corinius,” said she, “change first\r\nthine own fashion, I pray thee, ere thou convince gay attire of inward\r\nfolly, lest beholding thee we misdoubt thy precept—or thy wisdom.”\r\n\r\nCorinius drank his cup to the drains and laughed. Somewhat reddened\r\nwas his insolent handsome face about the cheeks and shaven jowl, for\r\nsurely was none in that hall more richly apparelled than he. His ample\r\nchest was cased in a jerkin of untanned buckskin plated with silver\r\nscales, and he wore a collar of gold that was rough with smaragds and\r\na long cloak of sky-blue silk brocade lined with cloth of silver. On\r\nhis left wrist was a mighty ring of gold, and on his head a wreath of\r\nblack bryony and sleeping nightshade. Gro whispered Corund in the ear,\r\n“He bibbeth it down apace, and the hour is yet early. This presageth\r\ntrouble, since ever with him indiscretion treadeth hard on the heels of\r\nsurliness as he waxeth drunken.”\r\n\r\nCorund grunted assent, saying aloud, “To all peaks of fame might\r\nGaslark have climbed, but for this same rashness. Nought more pitiful\r\nhath been heard to tell of than his great sending into Impland, ten\r\nyears ago, when, on a sudden conceit that a should lay all Impland\r\nunder him and become the greatest king in all the world, he hired\r\nZeldornius and Helteranius and Jalcanaius Fostus——”\r\n\r\n“The three most notable captains found on earth,” said La Fireez.\r\n\r\n“Nothing is more true,” said Corund. “These he hired, and brought ’em\r\nships and soldiers and horses and such a clutter of engines of war as\r\nhath not been seen these hundred years, and sent ’em—whither? To the\r\nrich and pleasant lands of Beshtria? No. To Demonland? Not a whit. To\r\nthis Witchland, where with a twentieth part the power a hath now risked\r\nall and suffered death and doom? No! but to yonder hell-besmitten\r\nwilderness of Upper Impland, treeless, waterless, not a soul to pay him\r\ntribute had he laid it under him save wandering bands of savage Imps,\r\nwith more bugs on their bodies than pence in their purses, I warrant\r\nyou. Or was he minded to be king among the divels of the air, ghosts,\r\nand hob-thrushes that be found in that desert?”\r\n\r\n“Without controversy there be seventeen several sorts of divels on\r\nthe Moruna,” said Corsus, very loud and sudden, so that all turned\r\nto look on him; “fiery divels, divels of the air, terrestrial divels,\r\nas you may say, and watery divels, and subterranean divels. Without\r\ncontroversy there be seven seen sorts, seventeen several sorts of\r\nhob-thrushes, and several sorts of divels, and if the humour took me I\r\ncould name them all by rote.”\r\n\r\nWondrous solemn was the heavy face of Corsus, his eyes, baggy\r\nunderneath and somewhat bloodshed, his pendulous cheeks, thick blubber\r\nunder-lip, and bristly gray moustachios and whiskers. He had eaten,\r\nmainly to provoke thirst, pickled olives, capers, salted almonds,\r\nanchovies, fumadoes, and pilchards fried with mustard, and now awaited\r\nthe salt chine of beef to be a pillow and a resting place for new\r\npotations.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Zenambria asked, “Knoweth any for certain what fate befell\r\nJalcanaius and Helteranius and Zeldornius and their armies?”\r\n\r\n“Heard I not,” said Prezmyra, “that they were led by Will-o’-the-Wisps\r\nto the regions Hyperborean, and there made kings?”\r\n\r\n“Told thee by the madge-howlet, I fear me, sister,” said La Fireez.\r\n“Whenas I fared through Impland the More, six years ago, there was many\r\na wild tale told me hereof, but nought within credit.”\r\n\r\nNow was the chine served in amid shallots on a great dish of gold,\r\nborne by four serving men, so weighty was the dish and its burden. Some\r\nlight there glowed in the dull eye of Corsus to see it come, and Corund\r\nrose up with brimming goblet, and the Witches cried, “The song of the\r\nchine, O Corund!” Great as a neat stood Corund in his russet velvet\r\nkirtle, girt about with a broad belt of crocodile hide edged with gold.\r\nFrom his shoulders hung a cloak of wolf’s skin with the hair inside,\r\nthe outside tanned and diapered with purple silk. Daylight was nigh\r\ngone, and through a haze of savours rising from the feast the flamboys\r\nshone on his bald head set about with thick grizzled curls, and on his\r\nkeen gray eyes, and his long and bushy beard. He cried, “Give me a\r\nrouse, my lords! and if any fail to bear me out in the refrain, I’ll\r\nne’er love him more.” And he sang this song of the chine in a voice\r\nlike the sounding of a gong; and all they roared in the refrain till\r\nthe piled dishes on the service tables rang:\r\n\r\n    Bring out the Old Chyne, the Cold Chyne to me,\r\n    And how Ile charge him come and see,\r\n    Brawn tusked, Brawn well sowst and fine,\r\n    With a precious cup of Muscadine:\r\n\r\n    _How shall I sing, how shall I look,\r\n    In honour of the Master-Cook_?\r\n\r\n    The Pig shall turn round and answer me,\r\n    Canst thou spare me a shoulder? a wy, a wy.\r\n    The Duck, Goose, and Capon, good fellows all three,\r\n    Shall dance thee an antick, so shall the Turkey:\r\n    But O! the Cold Chyne, the Cold Chyne for me:\r\n\r\n    _How shall I sing, how shall I look,\r\n    In honour of the Master-Cook_?\r\n\r\n    With brewis Ile noynt thee from head to th’ heel,\r\n    Shal make thee run nimbler than the new oyld wheel;\r\n    With Pye-crust wee’l make thee\r\n    The eighth wise man to be;\r\n    But O! the Old Chyne, the Cold Chyne for me:\r\n\r\n    _How shall I sing, how shall I look,\r\n    In honour of the Master-Cook_?\r\n\r\nWhen the chine was carved and the cups replenished, the King issued\r\ncommand saying, “Call hither my dwarf, and let him act his antick\r\ngestures before us.”\r\n\r\nTherewith came the dwarf into the hall, mopping and mowing, clad in a\r\nsleeveless jerkin of striped yellow and red mockado. And his long and\r\nnerveless tail dragged on the floor behind him.\r\n\r\n“Somewhat fulsome is this dwarf,” said La Fireez.\r\n\r\n“Speak within door, Prince,” said Corinius. “Know’st not his quality?\r\nA hath been envoy extraordinary from King Gorice XI. of memory ever\r\nglorious unto Lord Juss in Galing and the lords of Demonland. And ’twas\r\nthe greatest courtesy we could study to do them, to send ’em this looby\r\nfor our ambassador.”\r\n\r\nThe dwarf practised before them to the great content of the lords of\r\nWitchland and their guests, save for his japing upon Corinius and the\r\nPrince, calling them two peacocks, so like in their bright plumage that\r\nnone might tell either from other; which somewhat galled them both.\r\n\r\nAnd now was the King’s heart waxen glad with wine, and he pledged Gro,\r\nsaying, “Be merry, Gro, and doubt not that I will fulfil my word I\r\nspake unto thee, and make thee king in Zajë Zaculo.”\r\n\r\n“Lord, I am yours for ever,” answered Gro. “But methinks I am little\r\nfitted to be a king. Methinks I was ever a better steward of other\r\nmen’s fortunes than of mine own.”\r\n\r\nWhereat the Duke Corsus, that was sprawled on the table well nigh\r\nasleep, cried out in a great voice but husky withal, “A brace of divels\r\nbroil me if thou sayst not sooth! If thine own fortunes come off but\r\nbluely, care not a rush. Give me some wine, a full weeping goblet.\r\nHa! Ha! whip it away! Ha! Ha! Witchland! When wear you the crown of\r\nDemonland, O King?”\r\n\r\n“How now, Corsus,” said the King, “art thou drunk?”\r\n\r\nBut La Fireez said, “Ye sware peace with the Demons in the Foliot\r\nIsles, and by mighty oaths are ye bound to put by for ever your claims\r\nof lordship over Demonland. I hoped your quarrels were ended.”\r\n\r\n“Why so they are,” said the King.\r\n\r\nCorsus chuckled weakly. “Ye say well: very well, O King, very well,\r\nLa Fireez. Our quarrels are ended. No room for more. For, look you,\r\nDemonland is a ripe fruit ready to drop me thus in our mouth.” Leaning\r\nback he gaped his mouth wide open, suspending by one leg above it an\r\nhortolan basted with its own dripping. The bird slipped through his\r\nfingers, and fell against his cheek, and so on to his bosom, and so\r\non the floor, and his brazen byrny and the sleeves of his pale green\r\nkirtle were splashed with the gravy.\r\n\r\nWhereat Corinius let fly a great peal of laughter; but La Fireez\r\nflushed with anger and said, scowling, “Drunkenness, my lord, is a jest\r\nfor thralls to laugh at.”\r\n\r\n“Then sit thou mum, Prince,” said Corinius, “lest thy quality be called\r\nin question. For my part I laugh at my thoughts, and they be very\r\nchoice.”\r\n\r\nBut Corsus wiped his face and fell a-singing:\r\n\r\n    Whene’er I bib the wine down,\r\n      Asleepe drop all my cares.\r\n        A fig for fret,\r\n        A fig for sweat,\r\n      A fig care I for cares.\r\n        Sith death must come, though I say nay,\r\n        Why grieve my life’s days with affaires?\r\n\r\n    Come, bib we then the wine down\r\n      Of Bacchus faire to see;\r\n      For alway while we bibbing be,\r\n      Asleepe drop all our cares.\r\n\r\nWith that, Corsus sank heavily forward again on the table. And the\r\ndwarf, whose japes all else in that company had taken well even when\r\nthemselves were the mark thereof, leaped up and down, crying, “Hear a\r\nwonder! This pudding singeth. When with two platters, thralls! ye have\r\nserved it o’ the board without a dish. One were too little to contain\r\nso vast a deal of bullock’s blood and lard. Swift, and carve it ere the\r\nvapours burst the skin.”\r\n\r\n“I will carve thee, filth,” said Corsus, lurching to his feet; and\r\ncatching the dwarf by the wrist with one hand he gave him a great box\r\non the ear with the other. The dwarf squealed and bit Corsus’s thumb to\r\nthe bone, so that he loosed his hold; and the dwarf fled from the hall,\r\nwhile the company laughed pleasantly.\r\n\r\n“So flieth folly before wisdom which is in wine,” said the King. “The\r\nnight is young: bring me botargoes, and caviare and toast. Drink,\r\nPrince. The red Thramnian wine that is thick like honey wooeth the soul\r\nto divine philosophy. How vain a thing is ambition. This was Gaslark’s\r\nbane, whose enterprises of such pitch and moment have ended thus,\r\nin a kind of nothing. Or what thinkest thou, Gro, thou which art a\r\nphilosopher?”\r\n\r\n“Alas, poor Gaslark,” said Gro. “Had all grown to his mind, and had he\r\n’gainst all expectation gotten us overthrown, even so had he been no\r\nnearer to his heart’s desire than when he first set forth. For he had\r\nof old in Zajë Zaculo eating and drinking and gardens and treasure and\r\nmusicians and a fair wife, all soft ease and contentment all his days.\r\nAnd at the last, howsoe’er we shape our course, cometh the poppy that\r\nabideth all of us by the harbour of oblivion hard to cleanse. Dry\r\nwithered leaves of laurel or of cypress tree, and a little dust. Nought\r\nelse remaineth.”\r\n\r\n“With a sad brow I say it,” said the King: “I hold him wise that\r\nresteth happy, even as the Red Foliot, and tempteth not the Gods by\r\nover-mounting ambition to his dejection.”\r\n\r\nLa Fireez had thrown himself back in his high seat with his elbows\r\nresting on its lofty arms and his hands dangling idly on either side.\r\nWith head held high and incredulous smile he harkened to the words of\r\nGorice the King.\r\n\r\nGro said in Corund’s ear, “The King hath found strange kindness in the\r\ncup.”\r\n\r\n“I think thou and I be clean out o’ fashion,” answered Corund,\r\nwhispering, “that we be not yet drunken; the cause whereof is that thou\r\ndrinkest within measure, which is good, and me this amethyst at my belt\r\nkeepeth sober, were I never so surfeit-swelled with wine.”\r\n\r\nLa Fireez said, “You are pleased to jest, O King. For my part, I had as\r\nlief have this musk-million on my shoulders as a head so blockish as to\r\nwant ambition.”\r\n\r\n“If thou wert not our princely guest,” said Corinius, “I had called\r\nthat spoke in the right fashion of a little man. Witchland affecteth\r\nnot such vaunts, but can afford to speak as our Lord the King in proud\r\nhumility. Turkey cocks do strut and gobble; not so the eagle, who\r\nholdeth the world at his discretion.”\r\n\r\n“Pity on thee,” cried the Prince, “if this cheap victory turn thee so\r\ngiddy. Goblins!”\r\n\r\nCorinius scowled. Corsus chuckled, saying to himself but loud enough\r\nfor all to hear, “Goblins, quotha? They were small game had they been\r\nall. Ay, there it is: had they been all.”\r\n\r\nThe King’s brow was like a foul black cloud. The women held their\r\nbreath. But Corsus, blandly insensible of these gathering thunders,\r\nbeat time on the table with his cup, drowsily chanting to a most\r\nmournful air:\r\n\r\n    When birds in water deepe do lie,\r\n    And fishes in the air doe flie,\r\n    When water burns and fire doth freeze,\r\n    And oysters grow as fruits on trees—\r\n\r\nA resounding hecup brought him to a full close.\r\n\r\nThe talk had died down, the lords of Witchland, ill at ease, studying\r\nto wear their faces to the bent of the King’s looks. But Prezmyra\r\nspake, and the music of her voice came like a refreshing shower. “This\r\nsong of my Lord Corsus,” she said, “made me hopeful for an answer to a\r\nquestion in philosophy; but Bacchus, you see, hath ta’en his soul into\r\nElysium for a season, and I fear me nor truth nor wisdom cometh from\r\nhis mouth to-night. And this was my question, whether it be true that\r\nall animals of the land are in their kind in the sea? My Lord Corinius,\r\nor thou, my princely brother, can you resolve me?”\r\n\r\n“Why, so it is received, madam,” said La Fireez. “And inquiry will\r\nshow thee many pretty instances: as the sea-frog, the sea-fox, the\r\nsea-dog, the sea-horse, the sea-lion, the sea-bear. And I have known\r\nthe barbarous people of Esamocia eat of a conserve of sea-mice mashed\r\nand brayed in a mortar with the flesh of that beast named _bos\r\nmarinus_, seasoned with salt and garlic.”\r\n\r\n“Foh! speak to me somewhat quickly,” cried the Lady Sriva, “ere in\r\nimagination I taste such nasty meat. Prithee, yonder gold peaches and\r\nraisins of the sun as an antidote.”\r\n\r\n“Lord Gro will instruct thee better than I,” said La Fireez. “For my\r\npart, albeit I think nobly of philosophy, yet have I little leisure\r\nto study it. Oft have I hunted the badger, yet never answered that\r\nquestion of the doctors whether he hath the legs of one side shorter\r\nthan of the other. Neither know I, for all the lampreys I have eat, how\r\nmany eyes the lamprey hath, whether it be nine or two.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra smiled: “O my brother, thou art too too smoored, I fear me,\r\nin the dust of action and the field to be at accord with these nice\r\nsearchings. But be there birds under the sea, my Lord Gro?”\r\n\r\nGro made answer, “In rivers, certainly, though it be but birds of the\r\nair sojourning for a season. As I myself have found them in Outer\r\nImpland, asleep in winter time at the bottom of lakes and rivers, two\r\ntogether, mouth to mouth, wing to wing. But in the spring they revive\r\nagain, and by and by are the woods full of their singing. And for the\r\nsea, there be true sea-cuckows, sea-thrushes, and sea-sparrows, and\r\nmany more.”\r\n\r\n“It is passing strange,” said Zenambria.\r\n\r\nCorsus sang:\r\n\r\n    When sorcerers do leave their charme,\r\n    When spiders do the fly no harme.\r\n\r\nPrezmyra turned to Corund saying, “Was there not a merry dispute\r\nbetwixt you, my lord, concerning the toad and the spider, thou\r\nmaintaining that they do poisonously destroy one another, and my Lord\r\nGro that he would show thee to the contrary?”\r\n\r\n“’Twas even so, lady,” said Corund, “and it is yet in controversy.”\r\n\r\nCorsus sang:\r\n\r\n    And when the blackbird leaves to sing,\r\n    And likewise serpents for to sting,\r\n      Then you may saye, and justly too,\r\n      The old world now is turned anew:\r\n\r\nand so sank back into bloated silence.\r\n\r\n“My Lord the King,” cried Prezmyra, “I beseech you give order for the\r\nending of this difference between two of your council, ere it wax to\r\ndangerous heat. Let them be given a toad, O King, and spiders without\r\ndelay, that they may make experiment before this goodly company.”\r\n\r\nTherewith all fell a-laughing, and the King commanded a thrall, who\r\nshortly brought fat spiders to the number of seven and a crystal\r\nwine-cup, and inclosed with them beneath the cup a toad, and set all\r\nbefore the King. And all beheld them eagerly.\r\n\r\n“I will wager two firkins of pale Permian wine to a bunch of radishes,”\r\nsaid Corund, “that victory shall be given unto the spiders. Behold how\r\nwithout resistance they do sit upon his head and pass all over his\r\nbody.”\r\n\r\nGro said, “Done.”\r\n\r\n“Thou wilt lose the wager, Corund,” said the King. “This toad taketh no\r\nhurt from the spiders, but sitteth quiet out of policy, tempting them\r\nto security, that upon advantage he may swallow them down.”\r\n\r\nWhile they watched, fruits were borne in: queen-apples, almonds,\r\npomegranates and pistick nuts; and fresh bowls and jars of wine, and\r\namong them a crystal flagon of the peach-coloured wine of Krothering\r\nvintaged many summers ago in the vineyards that stretch southward\r\ntoward the sea from below the castle of Lord Brandoch Daha.\r\n\r\nCorinius drank deep, and cried, “’Tis a royal drink, this wine of\r\nKrothering! Folk say it will be good cheap this summer.”\r\n\r\nWhereat La Fireez shot a glance at him, and the King marking it said in\r\nCorinius’s ear, “Wilt thou be prudent? Let not thy pride flatter thee\r\nto think aught shall avail thee, any more than my vilest thrall, if by\r\nthy doing this Prince smell out my secrets.”\r\n\r\nBy then was the hour waxing late, and the women took their leave,\r\nlighted to the doors in great state by thralls with flamboys. In a\r\nwhile, when they were gone, “A plague of all spiders!” cried Corund.\r\n“Thy toad hath swallowed one already.”\r\n\r\n“Two more!” said Gro. “Thy theoric crumbleth apace, O Corund. He hath\r\ntwo at a gulp, and but four remain.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Corinius, whose countenance was now aflame with furious\r\ndrinking, held high his cup and catching the Prince’s eye, “Mark well,\r\nLa Fireez,” he cried, “a sign and a prophecy. First one; next two at a\r\nmouthful; and early after that, as I think, the four that remain. Art\r\nnot afeared lest thou be found a spider when the brunt shall come?”\r\n\r\n“Hast drunk thyself horn-mad, Corinius?” said the King under his\r\nbreath, his voice shaken with anger.\r\n\r\n“He is as witty a marmalade-eater as ever I conversed with,” said La\r\nFireez, “but I cannot tell what the dickens he means.”\r\n\r\n“That,” answered Corinius, “which should make thy smirking face\r\nturn serious. I mean our ancient enemies, the haskardly mongrels of\r\nDemonland. First gulp, Goldry, taken heaven knows whither by the King’s\r\nsending in a deadly scud of wind——”\r\n\r\n“The devil damn thee!” cried the King, “what drunken brabble is this?”\r\n\r\nBut the Prince La Fireez waxed red as blood, saying, “This it is then\r\nthat lieth behind this hudder mudder, and ye go to war with Demonland?\r\nThink not to have my help therein.”\r\n\r\n“We shall not sleep the worse for that,” said Corinius. “Our mouth\r\nis big enough for such a morsel of marchpane as thou, if thou turn\r\nirksome.”\r\n\r\n“Thy mouth is big enough to blab the secretest intelligence, as we now\r\nmost laughably approve,” said La Fireez. “Were I the King, I would draw\r\nlobster’s whiskers on thy skin, for a tipsy and a prattling popinjay.”\r\n\r\n“An insult!” cried the Lord Corinius, leaping up. “I would not take\r\nan insult from the Gods in heaven. Reach me a sword, boy! I will make\r\nBeshtrian cut-works in his guts.”\r\n\r\n“Peace, on your lives!” said the King in a great voice, while Corund\r\nwent to Corinius and Gro to the Prince to quiet them. “Corinius is\r\nwounded in the wrist and cannot fight, and belike his brain is fevered\r\nby the wound.”\r\n\r\n“Heal him, then, of this carving the Goblins gave him, and I will carve\r\nhim like a capon,” said the Prince.\r\n\r\n“Goblins!” said Corinius fiercely. “Know, vile fellow, the best\r\nswordsman in the world gave me this wound. Had it been thou that stood\r\nbefore me, I had cut thee into steaks, that art caponed already.”\r\n\r\nBut the King stood up in his majesty, saying, “Silence, on your lives!”\r\nAnd the King’s eyes glittered with wrath, and he said, “For thee,\r\nCorinius, not thy hot youth and rebellious blood nor yet the wine thou\r\nhast swilled into that greedy belly of thine shall mitigate the rigour\r\nof my displeasure. Thy punishment I reserve unto to-morrow. And thou,\r\nLa Fireez, look thou bear thyself more humbly in my halls. Over pert\r\nwas the message brought me by thine herald at thy coming hither this\r\nmorning, and too much it smacked of a greeting from an equal to an\r\nequal, calling thy tribute a gift, though it, and thou, and all thy\r\nprincipality are mine by right to deal with as seems me good. Yet did I\r\nbear with thee: unwisely, as I think, since thy pertness nourished by\r\nmy forbearance springeth up yet ranker at my table, and thou insultest\r\nand brawlest in my halls. Be advised, lest my wrath forge thunderbolts\r\nagainst thee.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince La Fireez answered and said, “Keep frowns and threats for\r\nthine offending thralls, O King, since me they affright not, and I\r\nlaugh them to scorn. Nor am I careful to answer thine injurious words;\r\nsince well thou knowest my old friendship unto thine house, O King,\r\nand unto Witchland, and by what bands of marriage I am bound in love\r\nto the Lord Corund, to whom I gave my lady sister. If it suit not my\r\nstomach to proclaim like a servile minister thy suzerainty, yet needest\r\nthou not to carp at this, since thy tribute is paid thee, ay, and in\r\nover-measure. But unto Demonland am I bound, as all the world knoweth,\r\nand sooner shalt thou prevail upon the lamps of heaven to come down\r\nand fight for thee against the Demons than upon me. And unto Corinius\r\nthat so boasteth I say that Demonland hath ever been too hard for you\r\nWitches. Goldry Bluszco and Brandoch Daha have shown you this. This is\r\nmy counsel unto thee, O King, to make peace with Demonland: my reasons,\r\nfirst that thou hast no just cause of quarrel with them, next (and this\r\nshould sway thee more) that if thou persist in fighting against them it\r\nwill be the ruin of thee and of all Witchland.”\r\n\r\nThe King bit his fingers with signs of wonderful anger, and for a\r\nminute’s time no sound was in that hall. Only Corund spake privately to\r\nthe King saying, “Lord, O for all sakes swallow your royal rage. You\r\nmay whip him when my son Hacmon returneth, but till then he outnumbers\r\nus, and your own party so overwhelmed with wine that, trust me, I\r\nwould not adventure the price of a turnip on our chances if it come to\r\nfighting.”\r\n\r\nTroubled at heart was Corund, for well he knew how dear beyond account\r\nhis lady wife held the keeping of the peace betwixt La Fireez and the\r\nWitches.\r\n\r\nIn this moment Corsus, somewhat roused in an evil hour out of lethargy\r\nby the loud talk and movement, began to sing:\r\n\r\n    When all the prisons hereabout\r\n    Have justled all their prisoners out,\r\n    Because indeed they have no cause\r\n    To keepe ’em in by common laws.\r\n\r\nWhereat Corinius, in whom wine and quarrelling and the King’s rebukes\r\nhad lighted a fire of reckless and outrageous malice before which all\r\ncounsels of prudence or policy were dissipated like wax in a furnace,\r\nshouted loudly, “Wilt see our prisoners, Prince, i’ the old banquet\r\nhall, to prove thyself an ass?”\r\n\r\n“What prisoners?” cried the Prince, springing to his feet. “Hell’s\r\nfuries! I am weary of these dark equivocations and will know the\r\ntruth.”\r\n\r\n“Why wilt thou rage so beastly?” said the King. “The man is drunk. No\r\nmore wild words.”\r\n\r\n“Thou canst not daff me so. I will know the truth,” said La Fireez.\r\n\r\n“So thou shalt,” said Corinius. “This it is: that we Witches be better\r\nmen than thou and thy hen-hearted Pixies, and better men than the\r\naccursed Demons. No need to hide it further. Two of that brood we have\r\nlaid by the heels, and nailed ’em up on the wall of the old banquet\r\nhall, as farmers nail up weasels and polecats on a barn door. And there\r\nshall they bide till they be dead: Juss and Brandoch Daha.”\r\n\r\n“O most villanous lie!” said the King. “I’ll have thee hewn in pieces.”\r\n\r\nBut Corinius said, “I nurse your honour, O King. We must no longer\r\nskulk before these Pixies.”\r\n\r\n“Thou diest for it,” said the King, “and it is a lie.”\r\n\r\nNow was dead silence for a space. At last the Prince sat down slowly.\r\nHis face was white and drawn, and he spake unto the King, slowly and\r\nin a quiet voice: “O King, that I was somewhat hot with you, forgive\r\nme. And if I have omitted any form of allegiance due to you, think\r\nrather that in my blood it is to chafe at such ceremonies than that I\r\nhad any lack of friendship unto you or ever dreamed of questioning your\r\nover-lordship. Aught that you shall require of me and that lieth with\r\nmine honour, aught of ceremony or fealty, will I with joy perform. And,\r\nsave against Demonland, is my sword ready against your enemies. But\r\nhere, O King, tottereth a tower ready to fall athwart our friendship\r\nand pash it in pieces. It is known to you, O King, and to all the\r\nlords of Witchland, that my bones were whitening these six years in\r\nImpland the More if Lord Juss had not saved me from the barbarous Imps\r\nthat followed Fax Fay Faz, who besieged me four months with my small\r\nfollowing shut up in Lida Nanguna. My friendship shall you have, O\r\nKing, if you yield me up my friends.”\r\n\r\nBut the King said, “I have not thy friends.”\r\n\r\n“Show me then the old banquet hall,” said the Prince.\r\n\r\nThe King said, “I will show it thee anon.”\r\n\r\n“I will see it now,” said the Prince, and he rose from his seat.\r\n\r\n“I will dissemble with thee no longer,” said the King. “I do love thee\r\nwell. But when thou askest me to yield up to thee Juss and Brandoch\r\nDaha, thou askest a thing all Pixyland and thy dear heart’s blood were\r\nunable to purchase from me. These be my worst enemies. Thou knowest not\r\nat what cost of toil and danger I have at last laid hand on them. And\r\nnow let not thy hopes make thee an unbeliever, when I swear to thee\r\nthat Juss and Brandoch Daha shall rot and die in prison.”\r\n\r\nAnd for all his gentle speeches, and offers of wealth and rich\r\nadvantage and upholding in peace and war, might not La Fireez shake the\r\nKing. And the King said, “Forbear, La Fireez, or thou wilt vex me. They\r\nmust rot.”\r\n\r\nSo when the Prince La Fireez saw that he might not move the King by\r\nsoft words, he took up his fair crystal goblet, egg-shaped with three\r\nclaws of gold to stand withal welded to a collar of gold about its\r\nmiddle bossed with topazes, and hurled it at Gorice the King, so that\r\nthe goblet smote him on the forehead, and the crystal was brast asunder\r\nwith the force of the blow, and the King’s forehead laid open, and the\r\nKing strook senseless.\r\n\r\nTherewith was huge uproar in the banquet hall; nor would Corund that\r\nany should have speedier hand therein than he, but catching up his\r\ntwo-edged sword and crying, “Look to the King, Gro! Here’s distressful\r\nrevels!” he leaped upon the table. And his sons likewise and Gallandus\r\nand the other Witches seized their weapons, and in like manner did La\r\nFireez and his men; and there was battle in the great hall in Carcë.\r\nCorinius, whose left hand only might as now wield weapon, even so\r\nsprang forth in most gallant wise, calling upon the Prince with many\r\nvile words to abide his onset. But the fumes of unbridled potations,\r\nthat being flown to his brain had made him frantic mad, wrought in\r\nhis legs more foggily, dulling their wonted nimbleness. And his foot\r\nsliding in a puddle of spilt wine he fell backward a grievous fall,\r\nstriking his head against the polished table. And Corsus that was now\r\nwell nigh speechless and quite stupefied with drink, so that a baby\r\nmight tell as well as he what meant this hubbub, reeled cup in hand,\r\nshouting, “Drunkenness is better for the body than physic! Drink\r\nalways, and you shall never die!” So shouting he was smitten square\r\nin the mouth by a breast of veal flung at him by Elaron of Pixyland,\r\nthe captain of the Prince’s bodyguard, and so fell like a hog athwart\r\nCorinius, and there lay without sense or motion. Then were the tables\r\noverset, and wounds given and taken, and swiftly ran the tide of\r\nvantage against the Witches. For albeit the Pixies were none such great\r\nsoldiers as they of Witchland, yet this served them mightily that they\r\nwere well nigh sober and their foes as so many casks filled with wine,\r\nstaggering and raving for the most part from their long tippling and\r\nquaffing. Nor did Corund’s amethyst avail him throughly, but the wine\r\nclogged his veins so that he waxed scant of breath and his strokes\r\nlighter and slower than they were wont.\r\n\r\nNow for the love he bare his sister Prezmyra and for his old kindness\r\nsake for Witchland, the Prince charged his men to fight only for the\r\noverpowering of the Witches, slaying none if so it might be, and on\r\ntheir lives to look to it that the Lord Corund took no hurt. And when\r\nthey had fairly gotten the mastery, La Fireez made certain of his folk\r\ntake jars of wine and therewith souse Corund and his men most lustily\r\nin the face, while others held them at weapon’s point, until by the\r\npower of the wine both within and without they were well brought under.\r\nAnd they barricaded the great doorway of the hall with the benches and\r\ntable tops and heavy oaken trestles, and La Fireez charged Elaron hold\r\nthe door with the most of his following, and set guards without each\r\nwindow that none might come forth from the hall.\r\n\r\nBut the Prince himself took flamboys and went six in company to the old\r\nbanquet hall, overpowered the guard, brake open the doors, and so stood\r\nbefore Lord Juss and Lord Brandoch Daha that hung shackled to the wall\r\nside by side. Something dazzled they were in the sudden torch-light,\r\nbut Lord Brandoch Daha spake and hailed the Prince, and his mocking\r\nhaughty lazy accents were scarcely touched with hollowness, for all\r\nhis hunger-starving and long watching and the cark and care of his\r\naffliction. “La Fireez!” he said. “Day ne’er broke up till now. And\r\nmethought ye were yonder false fitchews fostered in filth and fen, the\r\nspawn of Witchland, returned again to fleer and flout at us.”\r\n\r\nLa Fireez told them how things had gone, and he said, “Occasion\r\ngallopeth apace. Upon this bargain do I loose you, that ye come\r\nincontinently with me out of Carcë, and seek no revenge to-night upon\r\nthe Witches.”\r\n\r\nJuss said yea to this; and Brandoch Daha laughed, saying, “Prince, I\r\nso love thee, I could refuse thee nothing, were it shave half my beard\r\nand go in fustian till harvest-time, sleep in my clothes, and discourse\r\npious nothings seven hours a day with my lady’s lap-dog. This night we\r\nbe utterly thine. An instant only bear with us: this fare shows too\r\ngood to rest untasted after so much looking on. It were discourteous\r\ntoo to leave it so.” Therewith, their chains being now stricken off, he\r\neat a great slice of turkey and three quails boned and served in jelly,\r\nand Juss a dozen plovers’ eggs and a cold partridge. Lord Brandoch Daha\r\nsaid, “I prithee break the egg-shells, Juss, when the meat is out, lest\r\nsome sorcerer should prick or write thy name thereon, and so mischief\r\nthy person.” And pouring out a stoup of wine, he quaffed it off, and\r\nfilling it again, “Perdition catch me if it be not mine own wine of\r\nKrothering! Saw any a carefuller host than King Gorice?” And he pledged\r\nLord Juss in the second cup, saying, “I will drink with thee next in\r\nCarcë when the King of Witchland and all the lords thereof are slain.”\r\n\r\nThereafter they took their weapons that lay by on the table, set there\r\nto distress their souls and with little expectation they should so take\r\nthem up again; and glad at heart albeit somewhat stiff of limb they\r\nwent forth with La Fireez from that banquet hall.\r\n\r\nWhen they were come into the court-yard Juss spake and said, “Herein\r\nmight honour hold us back even hadst thou made no bargain with us, La\r\nFireez. For great shame it were to us and we fell upon the lords of\r\nWitchland when they were drunk and unable to meet us in equal battle.\r\nBut let us ere we be gone from Carcë ransack this hold for my kinsman\r\nGoldry Bluszco, since for his sake only and in hope to find him here we\r\nfared on this journey.”\r\n\r\n“So you touch no other thing but only Goldry if ye shall find him, I am\r\ncontent,” said the Prince.\r\n\r\nSo when they had found keys they ransacked all Carcë, even to the dread\r\nchamber where the King had conjured and the vaults and cellars below\r\nthe river. But it availed not.\r\n\r\nAnd as they stood in the court-yard in the torch-light there came forth\r\non a balcony the Lady Prezmyra in her nightgown, disturbed by this\r\nransacking. Ethereal as a cloud she seemed, pavilioned in the balmy\r\nnight, as a cloud touched by the exhalations of the unrisen moon.\r\n“What transformation is this?” said she. “Demons loose in the court?”\r\n\r\n“Content thee, dear heart,” said the Prince. “Thy man is safe, and all\r\nelse beside as I think; save that the King hath a broken head, the\r\nwhich I lament, and will without question soon be healed. They lie all\r\nin the banquet hall to-night, being too sleepy-sodden with the feast to\r\ntake their chambers.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra cried, “My fears are fallen upon me. Art thou broken with\r\nWitchland?”\r\n\r\n“That may I not forejudge,” he answered. “Tell them to-morrow that\r\nnought I did in hatred, and nought but what I was by circumstance\r\nenforced to. For I am not such a coward nor so great a villain as leave\r\nmy friends caged up while strength is left me to work for their setting\r\nfree.”\r\n\r\n“You must straightway forth from Carcë,” said Prezmyra, “and that o’\r\nthe instant. My step-son Hacmon, which was sent to gather strength\r\nto awe thee if need were, rideth by now from the south with a great\r\ncompany. Thy horses are fresh, and ye may well outdistance the King’s\r\nmen if they ride after you. If thou wilt not yet raise up a river of\r\nblood betwixt us, begone.”\r\n\r\n“Why fare thee well, then, sister. And doubt it not, these rifts ’tween\r\nme and Witchland shall soon be patched up and forgot.” So spake the\r\nPrince with a merry voice, yet grieved at heart. For well he weened the\r\nKing should never pardon him that blow, nor his robbing him of his prey.\r\n\r\nBut she said, sadly, “Farewell, my brother. And my heart tells me I\r\nshall never see thee more. When thou took’st these from prison, thou\r\ndidst dig up two mandrakes shall bring sorrow and death to thee and to\r\nme and to all Witchland.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince was silent, but Lord Juss bowed to Prezmyra saying, “Madam,\r\nthese things be on the knees of Fate. But imagine not that while life\r\nand breath be in us we shall leave to uphold the Prince thy brother.\r\nHis foes be our foes for this night sake.”\r\n\r\n“Thou swearest it?” she said.\r\n\r\nHe answered, “Madam, I swear it unto thee and unto him.”\r\n\r\nThe Lady Prezmyra withdrew sadly to her chamber. And in short space she\r\nheard their horse-hooves on the bridge, and looking forth beheld where\r\nthey galloped on the Way of Kings dim in the coppery light of a waning\r\nmoon rising over Pixyland. So sate she by the window of Corund’s lofty\r\nbed-chamber gazing through the night, long after her brother and the\r\nlords of Demonland and her brother’s men were ridden beyond her seeing,\r\nlong after their last hoof-beat had ceased to echo on the road. In a\r\nwhile fresh horse-hooves sounded from the south, and a noise as of many\r\nriding in company; and she knew it was young Hacmon back from Permio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 VIII: THE FIRST EXPEDITION TO IMPLAND\r\n\r\n  OF THE HOME-COMING OF THE DEMONS, AND HOW LORD JUSS WAS TAUGHT IN\r\n      A DREAM WHITHER HE MUST SEEK FOR TIDINGS OF HIS DEAR BROTHER.\r\n      AND HOW THEY TOOK COUNSEL AT KROTHERING, AND DETERMINED OF\r\n      THEIR EXPEDITION TO IMPLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nMidsummer night, ambrosial, starry-kirtled, walked on the sea, as the\r\nship that brought the Demons home drew nigh to her journey’s end. The\r\ncloaks of Lord Juss and Lord Brandoch Daha, who slept on the poop,\r\nwere wet with dew. Smoothly they had passage through that charmed\r\nnight, where winds were hushed asleep and nought was heard save the\r\nwaves talking beneath the bows of the ship, the lilting changeless\r\nsong of the steersman, and the creak, dip, and swash of oars keeping\r\ntime to his singing. Vega burned like a sapphire near the zenith, and\r\nArcturus low in the north-west, beaconing over Demonland. In the remote\r\nsouth-east Fomalhaut rose from the sea, a lonely splendour in the dim\r\nregion of Capricorn and the Fishes.\r\n\r\nSo rowed they till day broke, and a light wind sprang up fresh and\r\nkeen. Juss waked, and stood up to scan the gray glassy surface of\r\nthe sea spread to vast distances where sky and water faded into one.\r\nAstern, great clouds bridged the gates of day, boiling upwards into\r\ncrags of wine-dark vapour and burning plumes of sunrise. In the\r\nstainless spaces of the sky above these sailed the horned moon, frail\r\nand wan as a white foam-flower blown from the waves. Westward, facing\r\nthe thunder-smoke of dawn, the fine far ridge of Kartadza was like cut\r\ncrystal against the sky: the first island sentinel of many-mountained\r\nDemonland, his topmost cliffs dawn-illumined with pale gold and\r\namethyst while yet the lesser heights lay obscure, lapped in the folds\r\nof night. And with the opening day the mists swathing the mountain’s\r\nskirts were lifted up in billowy masses that grew and shrank and grew\r\nagain, made restless by the wayward winds which morning waked in the\r\nhollow mountain side, and torn by them into wisps and streamers. Some\r\nwere blown upward, steaming up the great gullies in the rocks below\r\nthe peak, while now and then a puff of cloud swam free for a minute,\r\nfloated a minute’s space as ready to sail skyward, then indolently\r\nstooped again to the mountain wall to veil it in an unsubstantial\r\nfleece of golden vapour. And now all the western seaboard of Demonland\r\nlay clear to view, stretching fifty miles and more from Northhouse\r\nSkerries past the Drakeholms and the low downs of Kestawick and Byland,\r\nbeyond which tower the mountains of the Scarf, past the jagged sky-line\r\nof the Thornbacks and the far Neverdale peaks overhanging the wooded\r\nshores of Onwardlithe and Lower Tivarandardale, to the extreme southern\r\nheadland, filmy-pale in the distance, where the great range of Rimon\r\nArmon plunges its last wild bastion in the sea.\r\n\r\nAs a lover gazing on his mistress, so gazed Lord Juss on Demonland\r\nrising from the sea. No word spake he till they came off\r\nLookinghaven-ness and could see where beyond the beaked promontory the\r\nsound opened between Kartadza and the mainland. Albeit the outer sea\r\nwas calm, the air in the sound was thick with spray from the churning\r\nof the waters among the reefs and swallowing shoals. For the tide ran\r\nlike a mill-race through that sound, and the roaring of it was plain\r\nto hear at two miles’ distance where they sailed. Juss said, “Mindest\r\nthou my shepherding of the Ghoul fleet into yonder jaws? I would not\r\ntell thee for shame whenas the fit was on me. But this is the first day\r\nsince the sending came upon us that I have not wished in my heart that\r\nthe Races of Kartadza had gulped me down also and given me one ending\r\nwith the accursed Ghouls.”\r\n\r\nLord Brandoch Daha looked swiftly upon him and was silent.\r\n\r\nNow in a short while was the ship come into Lookinghaven and alongside\r\nof the marble quay. There amid his folk stood Spitfire, who greeted\r\nthem, saying, “I made all ready to bring three of you home in triumph\r\nfrom your ship, but Volle counselled against it. Glad am I that I took\r\nhis counsel, and put by those things I had prepared. They had cut me to\r\nthe heart to see them now.”\r\n\r\nJuss answered him, “O my brother, this noise of hammers in\r\nLookinghaven, and these ten keels laid on the slips, show me ye\r\nhave been busied on things nearer our needs than bay-leaves and the\r\ninstruments of joy since thou camest home.”\r\n\r\nSo they took horse, and while they rode they related to Spitfire all\r\nthat had befallen since their faring to Carcë. In such wise came they\r\nnorth past the harbour, and so over Havershaw Tongue to Beckfoot where\r\nthey took the upper path that climbs into Evendale close under the\r\nscrees of Starksty Pike, and so came a little before noon to Galing.\r\n\r\nThe black rock of Galing stands at the end of the spur that runs down\r\nfrom the south ridge of Little Drakeholm, dividing Brankdale from\r\nEvendale. On three sides the cliffs fall sheer from the castle walls to\r\nthe deep woods of oak and birch and rowan tree which carpet the flats\r\nof Moongarth Bottom and feather the walls of the gill through which\r\nthe Brankdale beck plunges in waterfall after waterfall. Only on the\r\nnorth-east may aught save a winged thing come at the castle, across a\r\nsmooth grass-grown saddle less than a stone’s throw in width. Over that\r\nsaddle runs the paven way leading from the Brankdale road to the Lion\r\nGate, and within the gate is that garden of the grass walk between the\r\nyews where Lessingham stood with the martlet nine weeks before, when\r\nfirst he came to Demonland.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nWhen night fell and supper was done, Juss walked alone on the walls of\r\nhis castle, watching the constellations burn in the moonless sky above\r\nthe mighty shadows of the mountains, listening to the hooting of the\r\nowls in the woods below and the faint distant tinkle of cow-bells, and\r\nbreathing the fragrance borne up from the garden on the night wind that\r\neven in high summer tasted keen of the mountains and the sea. These\r\nsights and scents and voices of the holy night so held him in thrall\r\nthat it wanted but an hour of midnight when he left the battlements,\r\nand called the sleepy house-carles to light him to his chamber in the\r\nsouth tower of Galing.\r\n\r\nWondrous fair was the great four-posted bed of the Lord Juss, builded\r\nof solid gold, and hung with curtains of dark-blue tapestry whereon\r\nwere figured sleep-flowers. The canopy above the bed was a mosaic of\r\ntiny stones, jet, serpentine, dark hyacinth, black marble, bloodstone,\r\nand lapis lazuli, so confounded in a maze of altering hue and lustre\r\nthat they might mock the palpitating sky of night. And therein was the\r\nlikeness of the constellation of Orion, held by Juss for guardian of\r\nhis fortunes, the stars whereof, like those beneath the golden canopy\r\nin the presence chamber, were jewels shining of their own light, yet\r\nwith a milder radiance, as glow-worms’ sheen or dead wood glimmering in\r\nthe dark. For Betelgeuze was a ruby shining, and a diamond for Rigel,\r\nand pale topazes for the other stars. The four posts of the bed were\r\nof the thickness of a man’s arm in their upper parts, but their lower\r\nparts great as his waist and carven in the image of birds and beasts:\r\nat the foot of the bed a lion for courage and an owl for wisdom, and\r\nat the head an alaunt for faithfulness of heart and a kingfisher for\r\nhappiness. On the cornice of the bed and on the panels above the pillow\r\nagainst the wall were carved Juss’s deeds of derring-do; and the latest\r\ncarving was of the sea-fight with the Ghouls. To the right of the bed\r\nstood a table with old books of songs and books of the stars and of\r\nherbs and beasts and travellers’ tales, and there was Juss wont to lay\r\nhis sword beside him while he slept. All the walls were panelled with\r\ndark sweet-smelling wood, and armour and weapons hung thereon. Mighty\r\nchests and almeries hasped and bound with gold stood against the wall,\r\nwherein he kept his rich apparel. Windows opened to the west and south,\r\nand on each window-ledge stood a bowl of palest jade filled with white\r\nroses; and the air entering the bed-chamber was laden with their scent.\r\n\r\nAbout cock-crow came a dream unto Lord Juss, standing by his head and\r\ntouching his eyes so that he seemed to wake and look about the chamber.\r\nAnd he seemed to behold an evil beast all burning as a drake, busy in\r\nhis chamber, with many heads, the most venomous that ever he the days\r\nof his life had seen, and about it its five fawns, like to itself but\r\nsmaller. It seemed to Juss that in place of his sword there lay a great\r\nspear of fair workmanship on the table by his bed; and it seemed to\r\nhim in his dream that this spear had been his all his life, and was\r\nhis greatest treasure, and that with it he might accomplish all things\r\nand without it scarcely aught to his mind. He laboured to reach out\r\nhis hand to the spear, but some power withheld him so that for all his\r\nstriving he might not stir. But that beast took up the spear in its\r\njaws, and went with it forth from the chamber. It seemed to Juss that\r\nthe power that held him departed with the departing of the beast, so\r\nthat he leaped up and snatched down weapons from the wall and made an\r\nonslaught on the fawns of that fell beast that were tearing down the\r\nwoven hangings and marring with their fiery breath the figure of the\r\nkingfisher at the head of his bed. All the chamber was full of the reek\r\nof burning, and he thought his friends were with him in the chamber,\r\nVolle and Vizz and Zigg and Spitfire and Brandoch Daha, fighting with\r\nthe beasts, and the beasts prevailed against them. Then it seemed to\r\nhim that the bedpost carven in the likeness of an owl spake to him in\r\nhis dream in human speech; and the owl said, “O fool, that shalt justly\r\nbe put in great misery without end, except thou bring back the spear.\r\nHast thou forgot that this only is thy greatest treasure and most\r\nworthiest thy care?”\r\n\r\nTherewith came back that grim and grisful beast into the chamber, and\r\nJuss assailed it, crying to the owl, “Uncivil owl, where then must I\r\nfind my spear that this beast hath hidden?”\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed to him that the owl made answer, “Inquire in Koshtra\r\nBelorn.”\r\n\r\nSo tumultuous was Lord Juss’s dream that he was flung at waking out\r\nof bed on to the deerskin carpets of the floor, and his right hand\r\nclutched the hilt of his great sword where it lay on the table by his\r\nbed, whereas in his dream he had beheld the spear. Mightily moved was\r\nhe; and forthwith clothed himself, and faring through the dim corridors\r\ncame to Spitfire’s chamber, and sat on the bed and waked him. And\r\nJuss told him his dream, and said, “I hold myself clean of all blame\r\nhereabout, for from that day forth this only hath been my care, how to\r\nfind my dear brother and fetch him home, and only then to wreak myself\r\non the Witches. And what was this spear in my dream if not Goldry? This\r\nvision of the night kindleth for us a beacon fire we needs must seek\r\nto. It bade me inquire in Koshtra Belorn, and till that be done never\r\nwill I rest nor so much as think on aught besides.”\r\n\r\nSpitfire answered and said, “Thou beest our oldest brother, and I shall\r\nfollow and obey thee in all that thou wilt do or shalt ordain hereof.”\r\n\r\nThen fared Juss to the guest-chamber, where Lord Brandoch Daha lay\r\na-sleeping, and waked him and told him all. Brandoch Daha snuggled him\r\nunder the bedclothes and said, “Let me be and let me sleep yet two\r\nhours. Then will I rise and bathe and array myself and eat my morning\r\nmeal, and thereafter will I take rede with thee and tell thee somewhat\r\nfor thine advantage. I have not slept in a goose-feather bed and\r\nsheets of lawn these many weeks. If thou plague me now, by God, I will\r\nincontinently take horse over the Stile to Krothering, and let thee and\r\nthine affairs go to the devil.”\r\n\r\nSo Juss laughed and left him in peace. And later when they had eaten\r\nthey walked in a plashed alley, where the air was cool and the purple\r\nshadow on the path was dappled with bright flecks of sunshine. Lord\r\nBrandoch Daha said, “Thou knowest that Koshtra Belorn is a great\r\nmountain, beside which our mountains of Demonland would seem but little\r\nhills unremarked, and that it standeth in the uttermost parts of earth\r\nbeyond the wastes of Upper Impland, and thou mightest search a year\r\nthrough all the peopled countries of the world and not find one living\r\nsoul who had so much as beheld it from afar.”\r\n\r\n“This much I know,” said Lord Juss.\r\n\r\n“Is thine heart utterly bent on this journey?” said Brandoch Daha. “Or\r\nis it not preposterous, and a thing to comfort our enemies, that we\r\nshould thus at the bidding of a dream fly to far and perilous lands,\r\nrather than pay Witchland presently for the shame he hath done us?”\r\n\r\nJuss answered him, “My bed is hallowed by spells of such a virtue that\r\nno naughty dream flown through the ivory gate nor no noisome wizardry\r\nhath power to trouble his sleep who sleepeth there. This dream is\r\ntrue. For Witchland there is time enow. If thou wilt not go with me to\r\nKoshtra Belorn, I must go without thee.”\r\n\r\n“Enough,” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “Thou knowest for thee I tie my\r\npurse with a spider’s thread. Then fare we must to Impland, and herein\r\nmay I help thee. For listen while I tell thee a thing. Whenas I slew\r\nGorice X. in Goblinland, Gaslark gave me, along with other good gifts,\r\na great curiosity: a treatise or book copied out on parchment by\r\nBhorreon his secretary, wherein it speaketh of all the ways to Impland\r\nand what countries and kingdoms lie next to the Moruna and the fronts\r\nthereof, and the marvels that be found in those lands. And all that is\r\nwrit in this book was set down faithfully by Bhorreon after the telling\r\nof Gro, the same which now hath part with the Witchlanders. Great\r\nhonour had Gro as then from Gaslark for his far journeyings and for\r\nthat which is written in this book of wonders; and this it was that had\r\nfirst put it in Gaslark’s mind to send that expedition into Impland,\r\nwhich so reduced him and came so wretchedly to nought. If then thou\r\nwilt seek to Koshtra Belorn, come home with me to-day and I will show\r\nthee my book.”\r\n\r\nSo spake Lord Brandoch Daha, and Lord Juss straightway ordered forth\r\nthe horses, and sent messengers to Volle under Kartadza and to Vizz at\r\nDarklairstead bidding them meet him at Krothering with what speed they\r\nmight. It was four hours before noon when Juss, Spitfire, and Brandoch\r\nDaha rode down from Galing and through the woods of Moongarth Bottom\r\nat the foot of the lake, taking the main bridle road up Breakingdale,\r\nthat runs by the western margin of Moonmere under the buttresses of\r\nthe Scarf. They rode slowly, for the sun was strong on their backs.\r\nGlassy was the lake and like a turquoise, and the birch-clad slopes\r\nto the east and north and the bare rugged ridges of Stathfell and\r\nBudrafell beyond were mirrored in its depths. On the left as they\r\nrode, the spurs of the Scarf impended from on high in piled bastions\r\nof black porphyry like giants’ castles; and little valleys choked with\r\nmonstrous boulders, among which the silver birches crowding showed\r\nlike tiny garden plants, ran steeply back between the spurs. Up those\r\nvalleys appeared successively the main summits of the Scarf, savage and\r\nremote, frowning downward as it were between their own knees: Glaumry\r\nPike, Micklescarf, and Illstack. By noon they had climbed to the\r\nextreme head of Breakingdale, and halted on the Stile, a little beyond\r\nthe water-shed, under the sheer northern wall of Ill Drennock. Before\r\nthem the pass plunged steeply into Amadardale. The lower reach of\r\nSwitchwater shone fifteen miles or more to the west, well nigh hidden\r\nin the heat-haze. Nearer at hand in the north-west lay Rammerick Mere,\r\nbosomed among the smooth-backed Kelialand hills and the easternmost\r\nuplands of Shalgreth Heath, with the sea beyond; and on the valley\r\nfloor, near the watersmeet where Transdale runs into Amadardale, it\r\nwas possible to descry the roofs of Zigg’s house at Many Bushes.\r\n\r\nWhen they came down thither, Zigg was out a-hunting. So they left word\r\nwith his lady wife and drank a stirrup cup and rode on, up Switchwater\r\nWay, and for twelve miles and more along the southern shore of\r\nSwitchwater. So dropped they into Gashterndale, and thence rounding the\r\nwestern slopes of Erngate End came up on to Krothering Side when the\r\nshadows were lengthening in the golden summer evening. The Side ran\r\ngently west for a league or more to where Thunderfirth lay like beaten\r\ngold beneath the sun. Across the Firth the pine-forests of Westmark,\r\nold as the world, rose toward Brocksty Edge and Gemsar Edge: a\r\nfar-flung amphitheatre of bare cliff and scree shutting in the prospect\r\nto the north. High on the left towered the precipices of Erngate End;\r\nsouthward and south-eastward lay the sea. So rode they down the Side,\r\nthrough deep peaceful meadows fair with white ox-eye daisies, bluebells\r\nand yellow goatsbeard and sea campion, deep-blue gentians, agrimony and\r\nwild marjoram, and pink clover and bindweed and great yellow buttercups\r\nfeasting on the sun. And on an eminence beyond which the land fell away\r\nmore steeply toward the sea, the onyx towers of Krothering standing\r\nabove woods and gardens showed milk-white against heaven and the clear\r\nhyaline.\r\n\r\nWhen they were now but half a mile from the castle Juss said, “Behold\r\nand see. The Lady Mevrian hath espied us from afar, and rideth forth to\r\nbring thee home.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha cantered ahead to meet her: a lady light of build and\r\nexceeding fair to look upon, brave of carriage like a war-horse, soft\r\nof feature, clear-browed, gray-eyed and proud-eyed: sweet-mouthed, but\r\nnot as one who can speak nought but sweetness. Her robe was of pale\r\nbuff-coloured silk, with corsage covered as by a spider’s web with fine\r\ngolden threads; and she wore a point-lace ruffle stiffened with gold\r\nand silver wire and spangled with little diamonds. Her deep hair, black\r\nas the raven’s wing, was fastened with pins of gold, and a yellow rose\r\nthat nestled in its coils was as the moon looking forth among thick\r\nclouds of night.\r\n\r\n“Doings be afoot, my lady sister,” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “One King\r\nof Witchland have we done down since we sailed hence; and guested in\r\nCarcë with another, little to our content. All which things I’ll tell\r\nthee anon. Now lieth our road south for Impland, and Krothering is but\r\nour caravanserai.”\r\n\r\nShe turned her horse, and they rode all in company into the shadow of\r\nthe ancient cedars that clustered to the north of the home-meads and\r\npleasure gardens, stately, gaunt-limbed, flat-browed, bleak against\r\nthe sky. On the left a lily-paven lake slept cool beneath mighty\r\nelms, with a black swan near the bank and her four cygnets dozing in\r\na row, their heads tucked beneath their wings, so that they looked\r\nlike balls of gray-brown froth floating on the water. The path leading\r\nto the bridge-gate zig-zagged steeply up the mound between low broad\r\nbalustrades of white onyx bearing at intervals square onyx pots,\r\nplanted some with yellow roses and some with wondrous flowers, great\r\nand delicate, with frail white shell-like petals. Deep, mysterious\r\ncentres had those flowers, thick with soft hairs within, and dark\r\nwithin with velvety purple streaked with black and blood colour and\r\ndust of gold.\r\n\r\nThe castle of Lord Brandoch Daha standing at the top of the mound was\r\ncircled by a ditch both broad and deep. The gate before the drawbridge\r\nwas of iron gilded and richly wrought. The towers and gate-house\r\nwere of white onyx like the castle itself, and on either hand before\r\nthe gate was a colossal marble hippogriff, standing more than thirty\r\nfeet high at the withers; and the wings and hooves and talons of the\r\nhippogriffs and their manes and forelocks were overlaid with gold, and\r\ntheir eyes carbuncles of purest lustre. Over the gate was written in\r\nletters of gold:\r\n\r\n    Ye braggers an’ a’,\r\n    Be skeered and awa’\r\n    Frae Brandoch Daha.\r\n\r\nBut to tell even a tenth part of the marvels rich and beautiful that\r\nwere in the house of Krothering: its cool courts and colonnades rich\r\nwith gems and fragrant with costly spices and strange blooms: its\r\nbed-chambers where, caught like Aphrodite in her golden net, the\r\nspirit of sleep seemed ever to shake slumber from its plumes, and none\r\nmight be waking long in those chambers but sweet sleep overcame their\r\neyelids: the Chamber of the Sun and the Chamber of the Moon, and the\r\ngreat middle hall with its high gallery and ivory stair: to tell of\r\nall these were but to cloy imagination with picturing in one while of\r\nover-much glory and splendour.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNought befell that night save the coming of Zigg before sun-down, and\r\nof those brethren Volle and Vizz in the night, having ridden hard in\r\nobedience to the word of Juss. In the morning when they had eaten their\r\nday-meal the lords of Demonland went down into the pleasaunces, and\r\nwith them the Lady Mevrian. And in an alley that was roofed with beams\r\nof cedar resting on marble pillars, the beams and pillars smothered\r\nwith dark-red roses, they sat looking eastward across a sunk garden.\r\nThe weather was sweet and gracious, and thick dew lay on the pale\r\nterraced lawns that led down among flower beds to the fish-pond in the\r\nmidst. The water made a cool mirror whereon floated yellow and crimson\r\nwater-lilies opening to the sky. All the greens and flower-colours\r\nglowed warm and clean, but soft withal and shadowy, veiled in the gray\r\nhaze of the summer morning.\r\n\r\nThey sat here and there as they listed on chairs and benches, near a\r\nhuge tank or vase of dark green jade where sulphur-coloured lilies grew\r\nin languorous beauty, their back-curled petals showing the scarlet\r\nanthers; and all the air was heavy with their sweetness. The great jade\r\nvase was round and flat like the body of a tortoise, open at the top\r\nwhere the lilies grew. It was carved with scales, as it were the body\r\nof a dragon, and a dragon’s head a-gaping reared itself at one end, and\r\nat the other the tail curved up and over like the handle of a basket,\r\nand the tail had little fore and hind feet with claws, and a smaller\r\nhead at the end of the tail gaped downwards biting at the large head.\r\nFour legs supported the body, and each leg was a small dragon standing\r\non its hind feet, its head growing into the parent body as the thigh or\r\nshoulder joint should join the trunk. In the curve of the creature’s\r\nneck, his back propped against its head, sat the Lord Brandoch Daha in\r\ngraceful ease, one foot touching the ground, the other swinging free;\r\nand in his hands was the book, bound in dark puce-coloured goatskin and\r\ngold, given him by Gaslark in years gone by. Zigg watched him idly turn\r\nthe pages while the others talked. Leaning toward Mevrian he whispered\r\nin her ear, “Is not he able and shapen for to subdue and put under him\r\nall the world: thy brother? A man of blood and peril, and yet so fair\r\nto behold that it is a marvel?”\r\n\r\nHer eyes danced. She said, “It is pure truth, my lord.”\r\n\r\nNow spake Spitfire saying, “Read forth to us, I pray thee, the book of\r\nGro; for my soul is afire to set forth on this faring.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis writ somewhat crabbedly,” said Brandoch Daha, “and most damnably\r\nlong. I spent half last night a-searching on’t, and ’tis most apparent\r\nno other way lieth to these mountains save by the Moruna, and across\r\nthe Moruna is (if Gro say true) but one way, and that from the Gulf of\r\nMuelva: ‘a xx dayes journeye from northe by south-est.’ For here he\r\ntelleth of watersprings by the way, but he saith in other parts of the\r\ndesert be no watersprings, save only springs venomous, where ‘The water\r\nriketh like a sething potte continually, having sumwhat a sulphureous\r\nand sumwhat onpleasant savor,’ and, ‘The grownd nurysheth here no\r\nplante nor herbe except yt bee venomous champinions or tode stooles.’”\r\n\r\n“If he say true?” said Spitfire. “He is a turncoat and a renegado.\r\nWherefore not therefore a liar?”\r\n\r\n“But a philosopher,” answered Juss. “I knew him well of old in\r\nGoblinland, and I judge him to be one who is not false save only in\r\npolicy. Subtle of mind he is, and dearly loveth plotting and scheming,\r\nand, as I think, perversely affecteth ever the losing side if he be\r\nbrought into any quarrel; and this hath dragged him oft-times to\r\nmisfortune. But in this book of his travels he must needs speak truth,\r\nas it seemeth to me, to be true to his own self.”\r\n\r\nThe Lady Mevrian looked approvingly on Lord Juss and her eye twinkled.\r\nFor well it liked her humour to hear men’s natures so divined.\r\n\r\n“O Juss, friend of my heart,” said Lord Brandoch Daha, “thy words\r\nproceed, as ever they did, from the true fount of wisdom, and I\r\nembrace them and thee. This book is a guide which we shall follow not\r\nhelter-skelter but as old men of war. If then the right road to Morna\r\nMoruna lie from the Gulf of Muelva, were we not best sail straight\r\nthitherward and lay up our ships in that Gulf where the coast and the\r\ncountry side be without habitation, rather than fare to some nearer\r\nhaven of Outer Impland such as Arlan Mouth whither thou and Spitfire\r\nfared six summers ago?”\r\n\r\n“Not Arlan Mouth, o’ this journey,” said Juss. “Some sport perchance\r\nwe might obtain there had we leisure for fighting with the accursed\r\ninhabitants, but every day’s delay we now do make holdeth my brother\r\nanother day in bondage. The princes and Fazes of the Imps have many\r\nstrong walled towns and towers in all those coastlands, and hard by in\r\na mediamnis of the river Arlan, in Orpish, is the great castle of Fax\r\nFay Faz, whereto Goldry and I drave him home from Lida Nanguna.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis an ill coast too, to find a landing,” said Brandoch Daha, turning\r\nthe leaves of the book. “As he saith, ‘Ymplande the More beginnith at\r\nthe west syde of the mowth of Arlan and occupiethe all the lond unto\r\nthe hedeland Sibrion, and therefro sowth awaye to the Corshe, by gesse\r\na vij hundered myles, wherby the se is not ther of nature favorable nor\r\nno haven is or cumming yn meete for shippes.’”\r\n\r\nSo after some talk and searching of that book of Gro they determined\r\nthis should be their plan: to fare to Impland by way of the Straits\r\nof Melikaphkhaz and the Didornian Sea, and so lay up their ships in\r\nthe Gulf of Muelva, and landing there start straightway across the\r\nwilderness to Morna Moruna, even as Gro had described the way.\r\n\r\n“Ere we leave it,” said Brandoch Daha, “hear what he speaketh\r\nconcerning Koshtra Belorn. This he beheld from Morna Moruna, whereof\r\nhe saith: ‘The contery is hylly, sandy, and baren of wood and corne,\r\nas forest ful of lynge, mores, and mosses, with stony hilles. Here\r\nis a mighty stronge and usid borow for flying serpens in sum baren,\r\nhethy, and sandy grownd, and thereby the litle round castel of Morna\r\nMoruna stondith on Omprenne Edge, as on the limit of the worlde, sore\r\nwether beten and yn ruine. This castelle was brent in tyme of warre,\r\nspoyled and razyd by Kynge Goriyse the fourt of Wytchlande in auncient\r\ndayes. And they say there was blamelesse folke dwellid therein and\r\nryghte gentle, nor was ther any need for Goriyse to have usid them so\r\ncruellie, when hee cawsyd the hole howsholde there to appere before\r\nhym and then slawe sum owt of hande, and the residew he throughe all\r\ndowne the steep cliffe. And but few supervivid after the gret falle,\r\nand these fled awaye thorough the untrodden forests of Bavvynaune and\r\nwithoute question perysht ther yn great sorwe and miserie. Sum fable\r\nthat it was for thys cruel facte sake that King Goriyse was eat by\r\ndivels on the Moruna with al hys hoste, one man onely cumming home\r\nagain to tell of these thynges bifallen.’ Now mark: ‘From Morna Moruna\r\nI behelde sowthawaye two grete mowntaynes standing over Bavvinane as\r\ntwo Queenes in bewty seted in the skye by estimacion xx legues fro\r\nhence above meny more ise robed mowntaines supereminente. The wyche as\r\nI lernyd was Coschtre Belourne the one and the othere Koshtre Pivrarca.\r\nAnd I veuyed them continuallie unto the going downe of the sun, and\r\nthat was the fayrest sighte and the most bewtifullest and gallant\r\nmarvaille that mine eyen hath sene.

And is more delyverer to goo than is fowle to flee. And hys\r\nvoys is as the roaryng of x lyons.’”\r\n\r\n“These beasts,” said Spitfire, “were alone enough to draw me thither. I\r\nshall bring thee home a small one, madam, to keep chained in the court.”\r\n\r\n“That should dash me from thy friendship for ever, cousin,” said\r\nMevrian, stroking the feathery ears of her little marmoset that\r\ncuddled in her lap. “That which feedeth on brains were overnourished in\r\nDemonland, and belike would overrun the whole country-side.”\r\n\r\n“Send it to Witchland,” said Zigg. “Where when it hath eat up Gro and\r\nCorund it may sup lightly on the King, and then most fortunately starve\r\nfor lack of its proper nutriment.”\r\n\r\nJuss stood up from his seat. “Thou and I and Spitfire,” said he to\r\nBrandoch Daha, “must to work roundly and gather strength, for ’tis\r\nalready midsummer. You, Vizz, Volle, and Zigg, must have the warding of\r\nour homes whiles we be gone. We cannot be less than two thousand swords\r\non this faring.”\r\n\r\n“How many ships, Volle,” asked Lord Brandoch Daha, “canst thou give us,\r\nbusked and boun, ere this moon wane?”\r\n\r\n“There be fourteen afloat,” said Volle. “Besides these, ten keels lie\r\non the slips at Lookinghaven, and nine more hath Spitfire but now laid\r\ndown on the beach before his house at Owlswick.”\r\n\r\n“Thirty and three in sum,” said Spitfire. “You see we have not twiddled\r\nour thumbs whilst ye were gone.”\r\n\r\nJuss paced back and forth with great strides, his brow clouded and\r\nhis jaw clenched. In a while he said, “Laxus hath forty sail, dragons\r\nof war. I am not so idle-headed as fare without an army into Impland,\r\nbut certain it is that if our ill-willers would move war against us we\r\nstand in apparent weakness, here or abroad, to throw back their onset.”\r\n\r\nVolle said, “Of these nineteen ships a-building no more than two can\r\ntake the water before a month be past, and but seven more ere six\r\nmonths’ time, push we never so mightily the work.”\r\n\r\n“The season weareth, and my brother wasteth in duress. We must sail ere\r\nanother moon grow old,” said Juss.\r\n\r\nVolle said, “Then with sixteen sail thou sailest, O Juss; and then thou\r\nleavest us not one ship at home till more be finished and launched.”\r\n\r\n“How can we leave you so?” cried Spitfire.\r\n\r\nBut Brandoch Daha looked towards his lady sister, met her glance, and\r\nwas satisfied. “The choice lieth fair before us,” said he. “If we will\r\neat the egg, little need to debate whether the shell must go.”\r\n\r\nMevrian rose from her seat laughing, and said, “Then let the council\r\nrise, my lords.” And her eyes grew serious, and she said, “Shall they\r\nmake rhymes upon us that we of Demonland, whom men repute and hold\r\nthe mightiest lords in all the world, hung sheepishly back from this\r\nhigh needful enterprise lest, our greatest captains being abroad, our\r\nenemies might haply take us at home at disadvantage? It shall not be\r\nsaid of the women of Demonland that they upheld such counsels.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          IX: SALAPANTA HILLS\r\n\r\n  OF THE LANDING OF LORD JUSS AND HIS COMPANIONS IN OUTER IMPLAND\r\n      AND THEIR MEETING WITH ZELDORNIUS, HELTERANIUS, AND JALCANAIUS\r\n      FOSTUS; AND OF THE TIDINGS TOLD BY MIVARSH, AND THE DEALINGS OF\r\n      THE THREE GREAT CAPTAINS ON THE HILLS OF SALAPANTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the thirty and first day after that council held in Krothering, the\r\nfleet of Demonland put to sea from Lookinghaven: eleven dragons of war\r\nand two great ships of burthen, bound for the uttermost seas of earth\r\nin quest of the Lord Goldry Bluszco. Eighteen hundred Demons fared\r\non that expedition, and not a man among them that was not a complete\r\nsoldier. For five days they rowed southaway on a windless sea, and on\r\nthe sixth the sea-cliffs of Goblinland came out of the haze on their\r\nstarboard bow. They rowed south along the land, and on the tenth day\r\nout from Lookinghaven passed under the Ness of Ozam, journeying thence\r\nfour days with a favouring wind over the open seas to Sibrion. But now,\r\nwhen they had rounded that dark promontory and were about steering east\r\nalong the coast of Impland the More, and less than ten days’ journey\r\nlay betwixt them and their haven in Muelva, a dismal tempest suddenly\r\nsurprised them. For forty days it swept them in hail and sleet over\r\nwide-wallowing ocean, without a star, without a course; till, on a\r\nfierce midnight of wind and darkness and roaring waters was Juss’s\r\nand Spitfire’s ship and other four in her company driven on the rocks\r\non a lee shore and broken in pieces. Hardly, and after long battling\r\namong great waves, those brethren won ashore, weary and hurt. In the\r\ninhospitable light of a wet and windy dawn they mustered on the beach\r\nsuch of their folk as had escaped out of the mouth of destruction; and\r\nthey were three hundred and thirty and three.\r\n\r\nSpitfire, beholding these things, spake and said, “This land hath a\r\nvillanous look stirreth my remembrance, as but to behold verjuice\r\nsoureth the mouth of him who once tasted thereof. Rememberest thou this\r\nland?”\r\n\r\nJuss scanned the low long coast-line that swept north and west to an\r\nestuary, and beyond ran westwards till it was lost in the scud and\r\ndriving spray. Desolate birds flew above the welter of the surges. He\r\nsaid, “Certainly this is Arlan Mouth, where least of all I had choosed\r\nto come a-land with so small a head of men. Yet shalt thou prove here,\r\nas it hath ever been, how all occasions are but steps for us to climb\r\nfame by.”\r\n\r\n“Our ships lost,” cried Spitfire, “and the more part of our men, and\r\nworst of all, Brandoch Daha that is worth ten thousand. Easilier shall\r\na little ant bib this ocean dry, than shall we in this taking perform\r\nour enterprise.” And he cursed and blasphemed, saying, “Cursed be the\r\nmalice of the sea, which, having broke our power, now speweth us ashore\r\nhere to our mere undoing; and so hath done great succour to the King of\r\nWitchland, and unto all the world beside great damage.”\r\n\r\nBut Juss answered him, “Think not that these contrary winds come of\r\nfortune or by the influence of malignant and combustive stars. This\r\nweather bloweth out of Carcë. Even as these very waves thou beholdest\r\nhave each his back-wash or undertow, so followeth after every sending\r\nan undertow of evil hap, whereby, albeit in essence a less deadly\r\nthing, many have been drowned and washed away who stood unremoved\r\nagainst the main stroke of the breaker. So were we twice since that day\r\nbrought near to our bane: first, when our judgement being darkened with\r\na strange distraction we went up with Gaslark against Carcë; next, when\r\nthis storm wrecked us here by Arlan Mouth. Though by mine art I rebated\r\nthe King’s sending, yet against the maleficial undertow that followed\r\nit my charms avail not, nor the virtues of all sorcerous herbs that\r\ngrow.”\r\n\r\n“Are these things so, and wilt thou yet be temperate?” said Spitfire.\r\n\r\n“Content thee,” said Juss. “The sands run down. A certain time only\r\nrunneth this stream for our hurt; it must now have well nigh spent\r\nitself, and it were too perilous for him to conjure a second time, as\r\nlast May he conjured in Carcë.”\r\n\r\n“Who told thee that?” asked Spitfire.\r\n\r\n“I do but conjecture it,” answered he, “from my studying of certain\r\nprophetic writings touching the princes of that blood and line. Whereby\r\nit appeareth (yet not clearly, but riddlewise) that if one and the same\r\nKing, essaying a second time in his own person an enterprise in that\r\nkind, should fail, and the powers of darkness destroy him, then is not\r\nhis life spilt alone (as it fortuned aforetime unto Gorice VII. at his\r\nfirst attempt), but there shall be an end for ever of the whole house\r\nof Gorice which hath for so many generations reigned in Carcë.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Spitfire, “so stand we to our chance. Old muckhills will\r\nbloom at last.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow for nineteen days fared those brethren and their company eastward\r\nthrough Outer Impland: first across a country of winding sleepy rivers\r\nand reedy lakes innumerable, then by rolling uplands and champaign\r\nground. At length, on an even, they came upon a heath running up\r\neastward to a range of tumbled hills. The hills were not lofty nor\r\nsteep, but rugged of outline and their surface rough with crags and\r\nboulders, so that it was a maze of little eminences and valleys grown\r\nupon by heather and fern and rank sad-coloured grass, with stunted\r\nthorn trees and junipers harbouring in the clefts of the rocks. On the\r\nwater-shed, as on an horse’s withers, looking west to the red October\r\nsunset and south to the far line of the Didornian Sea, they came upon a\r\nspy-fortalice, old and desolate, and one sitting in the gate. For very\r\njoy their hearts melted within them, when they knew him for none other\r\nthan Brandoch Daha.\r\n\r\nSo they embraced him as one beyond hope risen from the grave. And he\r\nsaid, “Through the Straits of Melikaphkhaz was I borne, and wrecked at\r\nlast on the lonely shore ten leagues southward from this spot, whither\r\nI won alone, having lost my ship and all my dear companions. In my\r\nmind it was that ye must fare by this road to Muelva if ye suffered\r\nshipwreck in the outer coasts of Impland.\r\n\r\n“Harken,” he said, “and I will tell you a wonder. A seven-night have\r\nI awaited you in this roosting-stead of daws and owls. And it is a\r\ncaravanserai of great armies that pass by in the wilderness, and\r\nhaving parleyed with two I await the third. For well I think that\r\nhere I have made discovery of a great mystery, one that hath engaged\r\nthe speculations of wise men for years. For on that day of my coming\r\nhither, when sunset was red, as now you see it, behold an army marching\r\nup from the east with great flags a-flaunting in the wind and all kinds\r\nof music. Which I beholding, methought if these be enemies, then goeth\r\ndown my life’s days with honour, and if friends, then cometh provender\r\nfrom those waggons of burthen that follow this army. A weighty\r\nargument; since not so much as the smell of victuals had I, save nasty\r\nnuts and berries of the open field, since I came forth of the sea.\r\nSo went I, taking my weapons, on the walls of this spy-fortalice and\r\nhailed them, bidding them say forth their quality. And he that was\r\ntheir captain rode up under the walls, and hailed me with all courtesy\r\nand noble port. And who think ye ’twas?”\r\n\r\nThey answered nought.\r\n\r\n“One that hath been famous,” said he, “up and down the earth for a\r\nmarvellous valorous and brave soldier of fortune. Have ye forgot that\r\nenterprise of Gaslark that had its burying in Impland?”\r\n\r\n“Was he little and dark,” asked Juss, “like a keen dagger suddenly\r\nunsheathed at midnight? Or bright with the splendour of a pennoned\r\nspear at a jousting on high holiday? Or was he dangerous of aspect like\r\nan old sword, rusty in the midst but bright at point and edge, brought\r\nforth for deeds of destiny at the fated day?”\r\n\r\n“Thine arrow striketh in the triple ring o’ the mark,” said Lord\r\nBrandoch Daha. “Great of growth he was, and a very peacock of splendour\r\nin his panoply of war; and a great pitch-black stallion bare him. So I\r\nspake him fair, saying, ‘O most magnificent and godlike Helteranius,\r\nconqueror in an hundred fights, what makest thou these long years in\r\nOuter Impland with this great head of men? And what dark lodestone\r\ndraws you these nine years, since with great sound of trumpets and\r\ntramp of horses thou and Zeldornius and Jalcanaius Fostus went forth\r\nto make Impland Gaslark’s footstool; since which time all the world\r\nbelieveth you lost and dead?’ And he beheld me with alien eyes, and\r\nmade answer, ‘O Brandoch Daha, the world journeyeth to its silly will,\r\nbut I fare alway with my purpose before me. Be it nine years, or but\r\nnine moons, or nine ages, what care I? Zeldornius would I encounter\r\nand engage him in battle, that still fleeth before my face. Eat and\r\ndrink with me to-night; but think not to detain me nor to turn me to\r\nidle thoughts beside my purpose. For with the dawning of the day I must\r\nforth again in quest of Zeldornius.’\r\n\r\n“So I ate and drank and was merry that night with Helteranius in his\r\npavilion of silk and gold. And with the dawn he marshalled his army and\r\nmarched westward toward the plains.\r\n\r\n“And on the third day, as I sat without this wall, cursing your slow\r\ncoming, behold an army marching from the east and one leading them\r\nmounted on a small dun horse; and he was clad in black armour shining\r\nlike the raven’s wing, with black eagle’s plumes in his helm, and eyes\r\nlike the eyes of a cat-a-mountain, full of sparkling flame. Little was\r\nhe, and fierce of face, and lithe, and hard to look on and tireless to\r\nlook on like a stoat. And I hailed him from where I sat, saying, ‘O\r\nmost notable and puissant Jalcanaius Fostus, shatterer of the hosts of\r\nmen, whitherward over the lonely heaths forlorn, thou and thy great\r\narmament?’ And he lighted down from his horse, and took me by the arms\r\nwith both his hands, and said, ‘If a man dream, to speak with dead\r\nmen betokens profit. And art not thou of the dead, O Brandoch Daha?\r\nFor in forgotten days, that now spring up in my mind as flowers in a\r\nweed-choked garden after many years, so bloomest thou in my memory:\r\ngreat among the great ones of the world that was, thou and thine house\r\nin Krothering above the sea-lochs in many-mountained Demonland. But\r\noblivion, like a sounding sea, soundeth betwixt me and those days;\r\nand the noise of the surf stoppeth mine ears, and the mist of the sea\r\ndarkeneth mine eyes that strain for a sight of those far times and the\r\ndeeds thereof. Yet for those dead days’ sake, eat with me and drink\r\nwith me to-night, since here for a night once more I pitch my moving\r\ntent on Salapanta Hills. And to-morrow I fare onward. For never may\r\nrest bring balm to my soul until I find out Helteranius and smite his\r\nhead from his shoulders. Great shame to him but little marvel is it,\r\nthat he still courseth before me as an hare. For traitors were ever\r\ndastards. And who ever heard tell of a more hellish devilish damned\r\ntraitor than he? Nine years ago, when Zeldornius and I made ready to\r\ndecide our quarrels by battle, word came to me in a lucky hour how\r\nthat this Helteranius with cunning colubrine and malice viperine and\r\nsleights serpentine went about to attack me in the rear. So turned I\r\nright about to crush him, but the fat chuff-cat was fled.’\r\n\r\n“So spake Jalcanaius Fostus; and I ate and drank with him that night,\r\nand caroused with him in his tent. And at break of day he struck camp\r\nand rode westaway with his army.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha ceased, and looked eastward toward the gates of night.\r\nAnd lo, an army faring up from the lower moor-lands, toward them on\r\nthe ridge, horsemen and footmen in dense array, and their captain on a\r\ngreat brown horse riding in the van. Long-limbed he was and lean, all\r\narmed in dusty rusty armour hacked and dinted in an hundred fights,\r\nwith worn leather gauntlets on his hands and a faded campaigning\r\ncloak thrown back from his shoulders. He carried his casque at his\r\nsaddle-bow and his head was bare: the head of an old lean hunting-dog,\r\nwith white hair swept back from a rugged brow where blue veins showed;\r\ngreat-nosed and bony-faced, with huge bushy white moustachios and\r\neyebrows, and blue eyes gleaming from cavernous eye-sockets. His horse\r\nwas curst-looking, with ears laid back and blood-shed dangerous eyes,\r\nand he in the saddle sat erect and unyielding as a lance.\r\n\r\nWhen he and his army came up upon the ridge, he drew rein and hailed\r\nthe Demons. And he said, “On every ninth day these nine years have I\r\nbeheld this lonely place of earth, as I pursued after Jalcanaius Fostus\r\nthat still eludeth me and still fleeth before me; and this is strange,\r\nsince he was ever a great fighter and engaged these nine years past\r\nto do battle with me. And now fear cometh upon me that eld draweth a\r\nveil of illusion athwart mine eyes, portending the approach of death\r\nor ever I perform my will. For here in the uncertain light of evening\r\nrise up before me shapes and semblances as of guests of Gaslark the\r\nking in Zajë Zaculo in days gone by: old friends of Gaslark’s out\r\nof many-mountained Demonland: Brandoch Daha, that slew the King of\r\nWitchland, and Spitfire of Owlswick, and Juss his brother, the same\r\nwhich had lordship over all the Demons ere we fared to Impland. Ghosts\r\nand back-comers of a world forgot. But if ye be right flesh and blood,\r\nspeak and discover yourselves.”\r\n\r\nJuss answered him, “O most redoubtable Zeldornius and in war\r\ninvincible, well might a man expect spirits of the dead on these quiet\r\nhills about cockshut time. And if thou deem us such, how much more\r\nshall we, that be wanderers new-shipwrecked out of hungry seas, suppose\r\nthee but a shade, and these great hosts of thine but fetches of the\r\ndead that be departed, steaming up from Erebus as daylight dies?”\r\n\r\n“O most renowned and redoubtable Zeldornius,” said Brandoch Daha, “thou\r\nwast once my guest in Krothering. To resolve thy doubts and ours, bid\r\nus to supper. It were matter indeed if spirits bodiless were able to\r\nbib wine and eat up earthly bake-meats.”\r\n\r\nSo Zeldornius let pitch his tents, and appointed the fifth hour before\r\nmidnight for those lords of Demonland to sup with him. Ere they\r\nforgathered in Zeldornius’s tent they spake among themselves, and\r\nSpitfire said, “Was ever such a wonder or such a pitiful trick o’ the\r\nFates as bringeth these three great captains to waste the remnant of\r\ntheir days in this remote wilderness? Doubt not but there’s practice in\r\nit, that maketh them march these long years this changeless round, each\r\nfleeing one that would fain encounter him, and still seeking another\r\nthat flies before him.”\r\n\r\n“Never went man with that look of the eyes Zeldornius hath,” said Juss,\r\n“but he was a man ensorcelled.”\r\n\r\n“With such a look,” said Brandoch Daha, “went Helteranius and\r\nJalcanaius. But mark our interest. ’Twere good to break the charm and\r\nclaim their help for our pains. Shall’s show the old lion all the truth\r\nof this fact to-night?”\r\n\r\nSo spake Lord Brandoch Daha, and those brethren deemed his counsel\r\ngood. So at supper, when men’s hearts were gladdened with good cheer,\r\nthe Lord Juss sate him down by Zeldornius and opened to him this\r\nmatter, saying, “O renowned Zeldornius, how befalleth it that these\r\nnine years thou pursuest after Jalcanaius Fostus, shatterer of hosts,\r\nand what was your difference betwixt you that set you by the ears?”\r\n\r\nZeldornius said, “O Juss, must I answer thee by reasons in this matter\r\nthat is ruled by the high stars and Fate that lays men at their length?\r\nEnough for thee that unpeace befell betwixt me and Jalcanaius mighty\r\nin war, and it was confirmed between us that by the arbitrament of the\r\nbloody field we should end our difference. But he abode me not; and\r\nthese nine years I seek to meet with him in vain.”\r\n\r\n“There was a third of you,” said Juss. “What tidings hast thou of\r\nHelteranius?”\r\n\r\nZeldornius answered him, “No tidings.”\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou,” said Juss, “that I enlighten thee hereon?”\r\n\r\nZeldornius said, “Thou and thy fellows alone of the children of men\r\nhave spoken with me since these things began. For they that dwelt in\r\nthis region fled years ago, accounting the place accursed. A paltry\r\ncrew they were, and mean meat enow for our swords. Speak then, if thou\r\nmeanest me well, and show me all.”\r\n\r\n“Helteranius,” said Lord Juss, “pursueth thee these nine years, as\r\nthou pursuest Jalcanaius Fostus. My cousin here hath seen him but six\r\ndays ago, in this same place, and talked with him, and shook him by\r\nthe hand, and knew his mind. Surely ye be all three holden by some\r\nenchantment, that being old comrades in arms so strangely and to so\r\nlittle purpose do pursue each the other’s life. I prithee let us be\r\na mean betwixt you all to set you at one again, and free you from so\r\nstrange a thraldom.”\r\n\r\nBut with those words spoken was Zeldornius grown red as blood. In a\r\nwhile he said, “It were black treachery. I’ll not credit it.”\r\n\r\nBut Lord Brandoch Daha answered him, “From his own lips I received\r\nit, O Zeldornius. And thereto I plight my troth. This besides, that\r\nJalcanaius Fostus was turned from battling with thee nine years ago (as\r\nhe himself hath told me, and made firm his saying with most fearful\r\noaths), by intelligence brought him that Helteranius was in that hour\r\nminded to take him in the rear.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Spitfire, “and unto this day he marcheth on Helteranius’s\r\ntrack as thou on his.”\r\n\r\nWith those words spoken was Zeldornius grown yellow as old parchment,\r\nand his white moustachios bristled like a lion’s. He sat silent awhile,\r\nthen, resting upon Juss the cold and steady gaze of his blue eyes, “The\r\nworld comes back to me,” he said, “and this memory therewith, that they\r\nof Demonland were truth-tellers whether to friend or foe, and ever\r\nheld it shame to cog and lie.” All they bowed gravely and he said with\r\na great lowe of anger in his eyes, “This Helteranius deviseth against\r\nme, it well appeareth, the self-same treachery whereof he was falsely\r\naccused to Jalcanaius Fostus. There were no likelier place to crush\r\nhim than here on Salapanta ridge. If I stand here to abide his onset,\r\nthe lie of the ground befriendeth me, and Jalcanaius cometh at his\r\nheels to gather the broken meats after I have made my feast.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha said in Juss’s ear, “Our peacemaking taketh a pretty\r\nturn. Heels i’ the air: monstrous unladylike!”\r\n\r\nBut nought they could say would move Zeldornius. So in the end they\r\noffered him their backing in this adventure. “And when the day is won,\r\nthen shalt thou lend us thy might in our enterprise, and aid us in our\r\nwars with Witchland that be for to come.”\r\n\r\nBut Zeldornius said, “O Juss and ye lords of Demonland, I yield you\r\nthanks; but ye shall not meddle in this battle. For we came three\r\ncaptains with our hosts unto this land, and beheld the land, and laid\r\nit under us. Ours it is, and if any meddle or make with us, were we\r\nnever so set at enmity one with another, we must join together in\r\nhis despite and bring him to bane. Be still then, and behold and\r\nsee what birth fate shall bring forth on Salapanta Hills. But if I\r\nlive, thereafter shall ye have my friendship and my help in all your\r\nenterprises whatsoever.”\r\n\r\nFor awhile he sat without speech, his stark veined hands clenched on\r\nthe board before him; then rising, went without word to the door of\r\nhis pavilion to study the night. Then turned he back to Lord Juss, and\r\nspake to him: “Know that when this moon now past was but three days\r\nold I began to be troubled with a catarrh or rheum which yet troubleth\r\nme; and well thou wottest that whoso falleth sick on the third day\r\nof the moon’s age, he will die. To-night also is a new moon, and of\r\na Saturday; and that betokeneth fighting and bloodshed. Also the\r\nwind bloweth from the south; and he that beginneth that game with a\r\nsouth wind shall have the victory. With such uncertain blackness and\r\nbrightness openeth the door of Fate before me.”\r\n\r\nJuss bowed his head, and said, “O Zeldornius, thy speech is sooth.”\r\n\r\n“I was ever a fighter,” said Zeldornius.\r\n\r\nFar into the night sat they in the tent of renowned Zeldornius,\r\ndrinking and talking of life and destiny and old wars and the chances\r\nof war and great adventure; and an hour after midnight they parted, and\r\nJuss and Spitfire and Brandoch Daha betook them to their rest in the\r\nwatch-tower on the ridge of Salapanta.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nOn such wise passed three days by, Zeldornius waiting with his army on\r\nthe hill, and the Demons supping with him nightly. And on the third\r\nday he drew out his army as for battle, expecting Helteranius. But\r\nneither that day nor the next nor the next day following brought sight\r\nnor tidings of Helteranius, and strange it seemed to them and hard to\r\nguess what turn of fortune had delayed his coming. The sixth night was\r\novercast, and mirk darkness covered the earth. When supper was done,\r\nas the Demons betook themselves to their sleeping place, they heard\r\na scuffle and the voice of Brandoch Daha, who went foremost of them,\r\ncrying, “Here have I caught a heath-dog’s whelp. Give me a light. What\r\nshall I do with him?”\r\n\r\nMen were roused and lights brought, and Brandoch Daha surveyed that\r\nwhich he held pinioned by the arms, caught by the entrance to the\r\nfortalice: one with scared wild-beast eyes in a swart face, golden\r\near-rings in his ears, and a thick close-cropped beard interlaced\r\nwith gold wire twisted among its curls; bare-armed, with a tunic of\r\notter-skin and wide hairy trousers cross-stitched with silver thread,\r\na circlet of gold on his head, and frizzed dark hair plaited in two\r\nthick tails that hung forward over his shoulders. His lips were drawn\r\nback, like a cross-grained dog’s snarling betwixt fear and fierceness,\r\nand his white pointed teeth and the whites of his eyes flashed in the\r\ntorch-light.\r\n\r\nSo they had him with them into the tower, and set him before them, and\r\nJuss said, “Fear not, but tell forth unto us thy name and lineage, and\r\nwhat brings thee lurking in the night about our lodging. We mean thee\r\nno hurt, so thou practise not against us and our safety. Art thou a\r\ndweller in this Impland, or a wanderer, like as we be, from countries\r\nbeyond the seas? hast thou companions, and if so, where be they, and\r\nwhat, and how many?”\r\n\r\nAnd the stranger gnashed upon them with his teeth, and said, “O devils\r\ntransmarine, mock not but slay.”\r\n\r\nJuss entreated him kindly, giving him meat and drink, and in a while\r\nmade question of him once more, “What is thy name?”\r\n\r\nWhereto he replied, “O devil transmarine, pity of thine ignorance sith\r\nthou know’st not Mivarsh Faz.” And he fell into a great passion of\r\nweeping, crying aloud, “Woe worth the woe that is fallen upon all the\r\nland of Impland!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” said Juss.\r\n\r\nBut Mivarsh ceased not to wail and to lament, saying, “Out harrow and\r\nalas for Fax Fay Faz and Illarosh Faz and Lurmesh Faz and Gandassa\r\nFaz and all the great ones in the land!” And when they would have\r\nquestioned him he cried again, “Curse ye bitterly Philpritz Faz, which\r\nbetrayed us into the hand of the devil ultramontane in the castle of\r\nOrpish.”\r\n\r\n“What devil is this thou speakest of?” asked Juss.\r\n\r\n“He hath come,” he answered, “over the mountains out of the north\r\ncountry, that alone was able to answer Fax Fay Faz. And the voice of\r\nhis speech is like unto the roaring of a bull.”\r\n\r\n“Out of the north?” said Juss, giving him more wine, and exchanging\r\nglances with Spitfire and Brandoch Daha. “I would hear more of this.”\r\n\r\nMivarsh drank, and said, “O devils transmarine, ye give me strong\r\nwaters which comfort my soul, and ye speak me soft words. But shall I\r\nnot fear soft words? Soft words were spoke by this devil ultramontane,\r\nwhen he and cursed Philpritz spake soft words unto us in Orpish: unto\r\nme, and unto Fax Fay Faz, and Gandassa, and Illarosh, and unto all of\r\nus, after our overthrow in battle against him by the banks of Arlan.”\r\n\r\nJuss asked, “Of what fashion is he to look on?”\r\n\r\n“He hath a great yellow beard beflecked with gray,” said Mivarsh, “and\r\na bald shiny pate, and standeth big as a neat.”\r\n\r\nJuss spake apart to Brandoch Daha, “There’s matter in it if this be\r\ntrue.” And Brandoch Daha poured forth unto Mivarsh and bade him drink\r\nagain, saying, “O Mivarsh Faz, we be strangers and guests in wide-flung\r\nImpland. Be it known to thee that our power is beyond ken, and our\r\nwealth transcendeth the imagination of man. Yet is our benevolence of\r\nlike measure with our power and riches, overflowing as honey from our\r\nhearts unto such as receive us openly and tell us that which is. Only\r\nbe warned, that if any lie to us or assay craftily to delude us, not\r\nthe mantichores that lodge beyond the Moruna were more dreadful to that\r\nman than we.”\r\n\r\nMivarsh quailed, but answered him, “Use me well, you were best, and you\r\nshall hear from me nought but what is true. First with the sword he\r\nvanquished us, and then with subtle words invited us to talk with him\r\nin Orpish, pretending friendship. But they are all dead that harkened\r\nto him. For when he held them closed up in the council room in Orpish,\r\nhimself went secretly forth, while his men laid hands on Gandassa Faz\r\nand on Illarosh Faz, and on Fax Fay Faz that was greatest amongst us,\r\nand on Lurmesh Faz, and cut off their heads and set them up on poles\r\nwithout the gate. And our armies that waited without were dismayed\r\nto see the heads of the Fazes of Impland so set on poles, and the\r\narmies of the devils ultramontane still threatening us with death. And\r\nthis big bald bearded devil spake them of Impland fair, saying these\r\nthat he had slain were their oppressors and he would give them their\r\nhearts’ desire if they would be his men, and he would make them free,\r\nevery man, and share out all Impland amongst them. So were the common\r\nsort befooled and brought under by this bald devil from beyond the\r\nmountains, and now none withstandeth him in all Impland. But I that\r\nhad held back from his council in Orpish, fearing his guile, hardly\r\nescaped from my folk that rose against me. And I fled into the woods\r\nand wildernesses.”\r\n\r\n“Where last saw ye him?” asked Juss.\r\n\r\nMivarsh answered him, “A three days’ journey north-west of this, at\r\nTormerish in Achery.”\r\n\r\n“What made he there?” asked Juss.\r\n\r\nMivarsh answered, “Still devising evil.”\r\n\r\n“Against whom?” asked Juss.\r\n\r\nMivarsh answered, “Against Zeldornius, which is a devil transmarine.”\r\n\r\n“Give me some more wine,” said Juss, “and fill again a beaker for\r\nMivarsh Faz. I do love nought so much as tale-telling a-nights. With\r\nwhom devised he against Zeldornius?”\r\n\r\nMivarsh answered, “With another devil from beyond seas; I have forgot\r\nhis name.”\r\n\r\n“Drink and remember,” said Juss; “or if ’tis gone from thee, paint me\r\nhis picture.”\r\n\r\n“He hath about my bigness,” said Mivarsh, that was little of stature.\r\n“His eyes be bright, and he somewhat favoureth this one,” pointing\r\nat Spitfire, “though belike he hath not all so fierce a face. He is\r\nlean-faced and dark of skin. He goeth in black iron.”\r\n\r\n“Is he Jalcanaius Fostus?” asked Juss.\r\n\r\nAnd Mivarsh answered, “Ay.”\r\n\r\n“There’s musk and amber in thy speech,” said Juss. “I must have more of\r\nit. What mean they to do?”\r\n\r\n“This,” said Mivarsh: “As I sat listening in the dark without their\r\ntent, it was made absolute that this Jalcanaius had been deceived in\r\nsupposing that another devil transmarine, whom men call Helteranius,\r\nhad been minded to do treacherously against him; whereas, as the\r\nbald devil made him believe, ’twas no such thing. And so it was\r\nconcluded that Jalcanaius should send riders after Helteranius to make\r\npeace between them, and that they two should forthwith join to kill\r\nZeldornius, one falling on him in the front and the other in the rear.”\r\n\r\n“So ’tis come to this?” said Spitfire.\r\n\r\n“And when they have Zeldornius slain,” said Mivarsh, “then must they\r\nhelp this bald-pate in his undertakings.”\r\n\r\n“And so pay him for his redes?” said Juss.\r\n\r\nAnd Mivarsh answered, “Even so.”\r\n\r\n“One thing more I would know,” said Juss. “How great a following hath\r\nhe in Impland?”\r\n\r\n“The greatest strength that he can make,” answered Mivarsh, “of devils\r\nultramontane is as I think two score hundred. Many Imps beside will\r\nfollow him, but they have but our country weapons.”\r\n\r\nLord Brandoch Daha took Juss by the arm and went forth with him into\r\nthe night. The frosted grass crunched under their tread: strange stars\r\nblinked in the south in a windy space betwixt cloud and sleeping earth,\r\nAchernar near the meridian bedimming all lesser fires with his pure\r\nradiance.\r\n\r\n“So cometh Corund upon us as an eagle out of the sightless blue,” said\r\nBrandoch Daha, “with twelve times our forces to let us the way to the\r\nMoruna, and all Impland like a spaniel smiling at his heel; if indeed\r\nthis simple soul say true, as I think he doth.”\r\n\r\n“Thou fallest all of a holiday mood,” said Juss, “at the first scenting\r\nof this great hazard.”\r\n\r\n“O Juss,” cried Brandoch Daha, “thine own breath lighteneth at it, and\r\nthy words come more sprightly forth. Are not all lands, all airs, one\r\ncountry unto us, so there be great doings afoot to keep bright our\r\nswords?”\r\n\r\nJuss said, “Ere we sleep I will inform Zeldornius how the wind\r\nshifteth. He must face both ways now, till this field be cut. This\r\nbattle must not go against him, for his enemies be engaged (if Mivarsh\r\nsay true) to give the help of their swords to Corund.”\r\n\r\nSo fared they to Zeldornius’s tent, and Juss said by the way, “Of\r\nthis be satisfied: Corund bareth not blade on the hills of Salapanta.\r\nThe King hath intelligencers to keep him advertised of all enchanted\r\ncircles of the world, and well he knoweth what influences move here,\r\nand with what danger to themselves outlanders draw sword here, as\r\nwitness the doom fulfilled these nine years by these three captains.\r\nTherefore will Corund, instructed in these things by his master that\r\nsent him, look to deal with us otherwhere than in this charmed corner\r\nof the earth. And he were as well take a bear by the tooth as meddle\r\nin the fight that now impendeth, and so bring upon him these three\r\nseasoned armies joined in one for his destruction.”\r\n\r\nThey passed the guard with the watchword, and waked Zeldornius and told\r\nhim all. And he, muffled in his great faded cloak, went forth to see\r\nguards were set and all sure against an onslaught from either side. And\r\nstanding by his tent to give good night to those lords of Demonland, he\r\nsaid, “It likes me better so. I ever was a fighter; so, one fight more.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe morrow dawned and passed uneventful, and the morrow’s morrow. But\r\non the third morning after the coming of Mivarsh, behold, east and\r\nwest, great armies marching from the plains, and Zeldornius’s array\r\ndrawn up to meet them on the ridge, with weapons gleaming and horses\r\nchamping and trumpets blowing the call of battle. No greetings were\r\nbetwixt them, nor so much as a message of challenge or defiance, but\r\nJalcanaius with his black riders rushed to the onset from the west\r\nand Helteranius from the east. But Zeldornius, like a gray old wolf,\r\nsnapping now this way now that, stemmed the tide of their onslaught. So\r\nbegan the battle great and fell, and continued the livelong day. Thrice\r\non either side Zeldornius went forth with a great strength of chosen\r\nmen, in so much that his enemies fled before him as the partridge\r\ndoth before the sparrow-hawk; and thrice did Helteranius and thrice\r\nJalcanaius Fostus rally and hurl him back, mounting the ridge anew.\r\n\r\nBut when it drew near to evening, and the dark day darkened toward\r\nnight, the battle ceased, dying down suddenly into silence. Those lords\r\nof Demonland came down from their tower, and walked among the heaps of\r\ndead men slain toward a place of slabby rock in the neck of the ridge.\r\nHere, alone on that field, Zeldornius leaned upon his spear, gazing\r\ndownward in a study, his arm cast about the neck of his old brown horse\r\nwho hung his head and sniffed the ground. Through a rift in the western\r\nclouds the sun glared forth; but his beams were not so red as the ling\r\nand bent of Salapanta field.\r\n\r\nAs Juss and his companions drew near, no sound was heard save from the\r\nfortalice behind them: a discordant plucking of a harp, and the voice\r\nof Mivarsh where he walked and harped before the walls, singing this\r\nditty:\r\n\r\n      The hag is astride\r\n      This night for to ride;\r\n    The devill and shee together:\r\n      Through thick and through thin,\r\n      Now out and then in,\r\n    Though ne’er so foule be the weather.\r\n\r\n      A thorn or a burr\r\n      She takes for a spurre,\r\n    With a lash of a bramble she rides now;\r\n      Through brakes and through bryars,\r\n      O’re ditches and mires,\r\n    She followes the spirit that guides now.\r\n\r\n      No beast for his food\r\n      Dares now range the wood,\r\n    But husht in his laire he lies lurking;\r\n      While mischeifs, by these,\r\n      On land and on seas,\r\n    At noone of night are a working.\r\n\r\n      The storme will arise\r\n      And trouble the skies;\r\n    This night, and more for the wonder,\r\n      The ghost from the tomb\r\n      Affrighted shall come,\r\n    Cal’d out by the clap of the thunder.\r\n\r\nWhen they were come to Zeldornius, the Lord Juss spake saying, “O most\r\nredoubtable Zeldornius, renowned in war, surely thy prognostications by\r\nthe moon were true. Behold the noble victory thou hast obtained upon\r\nthine enemies.”\r\n\r\nBut Zeldornius answered him not, still gazing downwards before his\r\nfeet. And there was Helteranius fallen, the sword of Jalcanaius Fostus\r\nstanding in his heart, and his right hand grasping still his own sword\r\nthat had given Jalcanaius his bane-sore.\r\n\r\nSo looked they awhile on those two great captains slain. And Zeldornius\r\nsaid, “Speak not comfortably to me of victory, O Juss. So long as that\r\nsword, and that, had his master alive, I did not more desire mine own\r\nsafety than their destruction who with me in days gone by made conquest\r\nof wide Impland. And see with what a poisoned violence they laboured my\r\nundoing, and in what an unexpected ruin are they suddenly broken and\r\ngone.” And as one grown into a deep sadness he said, “Where were all\r\nheroical parts but in Helteranius? and a man might make a garment for\r\nthe moon sooner than fit the o’erleaping actions of great Jalcanaius,\r\nwho now leaveth but his body to bedung that earth that was lately\r\nshaken at his terror. I have waded in red blood to the knee; and in\r\nthis hour, in my old years, the world is become for me a vision only\r\nand a mock-show.”\r\n\r\nTherewith he looked on the Demons, and there was that in his eyes that\r\nstayed their speech.\r\n\r\nIn a while he spake again, saying, “I sware unto you my furtherance if\r\nI prevailed. But now is mine army passed away as wax wasteth before the\r\nfire, and I wait the dark ferryman who tarrieth for no man. Yet, since\r\nnever have I wrote mine obligations in sandy but in marble memories,\r\nand since victory is mine, receive these gifts: and first thou, O\r\nBrandoch Daha, my sword, since before thou wast of years eighteen\r\nthou wast accounted the mightiest among men-at-arms. Mightily may it\r\navail thee, as me in time gone by. And unto thee, O Spitfire, I give\r\nthis cloak. Old it is, yet may it stand thee in good stead, since this\r\nvirtue it hath that he who weareth it shall not fall alive into the\r\nhand of his enemies. Wear it for my sake. But unto thee, O Juss, give I\r\nno gift, for rich thou art of all good gifts: only my good will give I\r\nunto thee, ere earth gape for me.”\r\n\r\nSo they thanked him well. And he said, “Depart from me, since now\r\napproacheth that which must complete this day’s undoing.”\r\n\r\nSo they fared back to the spy-fortalice, and night came down on the\r\nhills. A great wind moaning out of the hueless west tore the clouds\r\nas a ragged garment, revealing the lonely moon that fled naked\r\nbetwixt them. As the Demons looked backward in the moonlight to where\r\nZeldornius stood gazing on the dead, a noise as of thunder made the\r\nfirm land tremble and drowned the howling of the wind. And they beheld\r\nhow earth gaped for Zeldornius.\r\n\r\nAfter that, the dark shut down athwart the moon, and night and silence\r\nhung on the field of Salapanta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    X: THE MARCHLANDS OF THE MORUNA\r\n\r\n  OF THE JOURNEY OF THE DEMONS FROM SALAPANTA TO ESHGRAR OGO:\r\n      WHEREIN IS SET DOWN CONCERNING THE LADY OF ISHNAIN NEMARTRA,\r\n      AND OTHER NOTABLE MATTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMivarsh Faz came betimes on the morrow to the lords of Demonland, and\r\nfound them ready for the road. So he asked them where their journey\r\nlay, and they answered, “East.”\r\n\r\n“Eastward,” said Mivarsh, “all ways lead to the Moruna. None may go\r\nthither and not die.”\r\n\r\nBut they laughed and answered him, “Do not too narrowly define our\r\npower, sweet Mivarsh, restraining it to thy capacities. Know that\r\nour journey is a matter determined of, and it is fixed with nails of\r\ndiamond to the wall of inevitable necessity.”\r\n\r\nThey took leave of him and went their ways with their small army. For\r\nfour days they journeyed through deep woods carpeted with the leaves\r\nof a thousand autumns, where at midmost noon twilight dwelt among\r\nhushed woodland noises, and solemn eyeballs glared nightly between the\r\ntree-trunks, gazing on the Demons as they marched or took their rest.\r\n\r\nThe fifth day, and the sixth and the seventh, they journeyed by the\r\nsouthern margin of a gravelly sea, made all of sand and gravel and no\r\ndrop of water, yet ebbing and flowing alway with great waves as another\r\nsea doth, never standing still and never at rest. And always by day and\r\nnight as they came through the desert was a great noise very hideous\r\nand a sound as it were of tambourines and trumpets; yet was the place\r\nsolitary to the eye, and no living thing afoot there save their company\r\nfaring to the east.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day they left the shore of that waterless sea and came\r\nby broken rocky ground to the descent to a wide vale, shelterless and\r\nunfruitful, with the broad stony bed of a little river winding in the\r\nstrath. Here, looking eastward, they beheld in the lustre of a late\r\nbright-shining sun a castle of red stone on a terrace of the fell-side\r\nbeyond the valley. Juss said, “We can be there before nightfall, and\r\nthere will we take guesting.” When they drew near they were ware,\r\nbetwixt sunset and moonlight, of one sitting on a boulder in their path\r\nabout a furlong from the castle, as if gazing on them and awaiting\r\ntheir coming. But when they came to the boulder there was no such\r\nperson. So they passed on their way toward the castle, and when they\r\nlooked behind them, lo, there was he sitting on the boulder bearing his\r\nhead in his hands: a strange thing, which would cause any man to abhor.\r\n\r\nThe castle gate stood open, and they entered in, and so by the\r\ncourt-yard to a great hall, with the board set as for a banquet, and\r\nbright fires and an hundred candles burning in the still air; but no\r\nliving thing was there to be seen, nor voice heard in all that castle.\r\nLord Brandoch Daha said, “In this land to fail of marvels only for an\r\nhour were the strangest marvel. Banquet we lightly and so to bed.”\r\nSo they sat down and ate, and drank of the honey-sweet wine, till\r\nall thoughts of war and hardship and the unimagined perils of the\r\nwilderness and Corund’s great army preparing their destruction faded\r\nfrom their minds, and the spirit of slumber wooed their weary frames.\r\n\r\nThen a faint music, troublous in its voluptuous wild sweetness, floated\r\non the air, and they beheld a lady enter on the dais. Beautiful she\r\nseemed beyond the beauty of mortal women. In her dark hair was the\r\nlikeness of the horned moon in honey-coloured cymophanes every stone\r\nwhereof held a straight beam of light imprisoned that quivered and\r\ngleamed as sunbeams quiver wading in the clear deeps of a summer sea.\r\nShe wore a coat-hardy of soft crimson silk, close fitting, so that she\r\ndid truly apparel her apparel and with her own loveliness made it more\r\nsumptuous. She said, “My lords and guests in Ishnain Nemartra, there be\r\nbeds of down and sheets of lawn for all of you that be aweary. But know\r\nthat I keep a sparrow-hawk sitting on a perch in the eastern tower, and\r\nhe that will wake my sparrow-hawk this night long, alone without any\r\ncompany and without sleep, I shall come to him at the night’s end and\r\nshall grant unto him the first thing that he will ask me of earthly\r\nthings.” So saying she departed like a dream.\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha said, “Cast we lots for this adventure.”\r\n\r\nBut Juss spake against it, saying, “There’s likely some guile herein.\r\nWe must not in this accursed land suffer aught to seduce our minds, but\r\nfollow our set purpose. We must not be of those who go forth for wool\r\nand come home shorn.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha and Spitfire mocked at this, and cast lots between\r\nthemselves. And the lot fell upon Lord Brandoch Daha. “Thou shalt not\r\ndeny me this,” said he to Lord Juss, “else will I never more do thee\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\n“I never could yet deny thee anything,” answered Juss. “Art not thou\r\nand I finger and thumb? Only forget not, whatsoe’er betide, wherefore\r\nwe be come hither.”\r\n\r\n“Art not thou and I finger and thumb?” said Brandoch Daha. “Fear\r\nnothing, O friend of my heart. I’ll not forget it.”\r\n\r\nSo while the others slept, Brandoch Daha waked the sparrow-hawk,\r\nnight-long in the eastern chamber. For all that the cold hillside\r\nwithout was rough with hoar-frost the air was warm in that chamber and\r\nheavy, disposing strongly to sleep. Yet he closed not an eye, but still\r\nbeheld the sparrow-hawk, telling it stories and tweaking it by the tail\r\never and anon as it grew drowsy. And it answered shortly and boorishly,\r\nlooking upon him malevolently.\r\n\r\nAnd with the golden dawn, behold that lady in the shadowy doorway. At\r\nher entering in, the sparrow-hawk clicked its wings as in anger, and\r\nwithout more ado tucked its beak beneath its wing and went to sleep.\r\nBut that bright lady, looking on the Lord Brandoch Daha, spake and\r\nsaid, “Require it of me, my Lord Brandoch Daha, that which thou most\r\ndesirest of earthly things.”\r\n\r\nBut he, as one bedazzled, stood up saying, “O lady, is not thy beauty\r\nat the dawn of day an irradiation that might dispel the mists of hell?\r\nMy heart is ravished with thy loveliness and only fed with thy sight.\r\nTherefore thy body will I have, and none other thing earthly.”\r\n\r\n“Thou art a fool,” she cried, “that knowest not what thou askest.\r\nOf all things earthly mightest thou have taken choose; but I am not\r\nearthly.”\r\n\r\nHe answered, “I will have nought else.”\r\n\r\n“Thou dost embrace then a great danger,” said she, “and loss of all thy\r\ngood luck, for thee and thy friends beside.”\r\n\r\nBut Brandoch Daha, seeing how her face became on a sudden such as\r\nare new-blown roses at the dawning, and her eyes wide and dark with\r\nlove-longing, came to her and took her in his arms and fell to kissing\r\nand embracing of her. On such wise they abode for awhile, that he was\r\nware of no thing else on earth save only the sense-maddening caress of\r\nthat lady’s hair, the perfume of it, the kiss of her mouth, the swell\r\nand fall of that lady’s breast straining against his. She said in his\r\near softly, “I see thou art too masterful. I see thou art one who\r\nwill be denied nothing, on whatsoever thine heart is set. Come.” And\r\nthey passed by a heavy-curtained doorway into an inner chamber, where\r\nthe air was filled with the breath of myrrh and nard and ambergris, a\r\nfragrancy as of sleeping loveliness. Here, amid the darkness of rich\r\nhangings and subdued glints of gold, a warm radiance of shaded lamps\r\nwatched above a couch, great and broad and downy-pillowed. And here for\r\na long time they solaced them with love and all delight.\r\n\r\nEven as all things have an end, he said at the last, “O my lady,\r\nmistress of hearts, here would I abide ever, abandoning all else for\r\nthy love sake. But my companions tarry for me in thine halls below,\r\nand great matters wait on my direction. Give me thy divine mouth once\r\nagain, and bid me adieu.”\r\n\r\nShe was lying as if asleep across his breast: smooth-skinned, white,\r\nwarm, with shapely throat leaned backward against the spice-odorous\r\ndarknesses of her unbound hair; one tress, heavy and splendid like\r\na python, coiled between white arm and bosom. Swift as a snake she\r\nturned, clinging fiercely about him, pressing fiercely again to his\r\nher insatiable sweet fervent lips, crying that here must he dwell unto\r\neternity in the intoxication of perfect love and pleasure.\r\n\r\nBut when in the end, gently constraining her to loose him and let him\r\ngo, he arose and clothed and armed him, that lady caught about her a\r\ntranslucent robe of silvery sheen, as when the summer moon veils but\r\nnot hides with a filmy cloud her beauties’ splendour, and so standing\r\nbefore him spake and said, “Go then. This is got by casting of pearls\r\nto hogs. I may not slay thee, since over thy body I have no other\r\npower. But because thou shalt not laugh overmuch, having required me\r\nof that which was beyond the pact and being enjoyed is now slighted of\r\nthee and abused, therefore know, proud man, that three gifts I here\r\nwill grant thee thereto of mine own choosing. Thou shalt have war and\r\nnot peace. He that thou worst hatest shall throw down and ruin thy fair\r\nlordship, Krothering Castle and the mains thereof. And though vengeance\r\nshall overtake him at the last, by another’s hand than thine shall it\r\ncome, and to thine hand shall it be denied.”\r\n\r\nTherewith she fell a-weeping. And the Lord Brandoch Daha, with great\r\nresolution, went forth from the chamber. And looking back from the\r\nthreshold he beheld both that and the outer chamber void of lady and\r\nsparrow-hawk both. And a great weariness came suddenly upon him. So,\r\ngoing down, he found Lord Juss and his companions sleeping on the\r\ncold stones, and the banquet hall empty of all gear and dank with\r\nmoss and cobwebs, and bats sleeping head-downward among the crumbling\r\nroof-beams; nor was any sign of last night’s banqueting. So Brandoch\r\nDaha roused his companions, and told Juss how he had fared, and of the\r\nweird laid on him by that lady.\r\n\r\nAnd they went greatly wondering forth of the accursed castle of Ishnain\r\nNemartra, glad to come off so scatheless.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nOn that ninth day of their journey from Salapanta they came through\r\nwaste lands of stone and living rock, where not so much as an\r\nearth-louse stirred with life. Gorges split the earth here and there:\r\nrock-walled labyrinths of gloom, unvisited for ever by sunbeam or\r\nmoonbeam, turbulent in their depths with waters that leaped and churned\r\nfor ever, never still and never silent. So was that day’s journey\r\ntortuous, turning now up now down along those river banks to find\r\ncrossing places.\r\n\r\nWhen they were halted at noon by the deepest rift they had yet beheld,\r\nthere came one hastening to them and fell down by Juss and lay panting\r\nface to earth as breathless from long running. And when they raised\r\nhim up, behold Mivarsh Faz, harnessed in the gear of a black rider\r\nof Jalcanaius Fostus and armed with axe and sword. Great was his\r\nagitation, and he speechless for lack of breath. They used him kindly,\r\nand gave him to drink from a great skin of wine, Zeldornius’s gift,\r\nand anon he said, “He hath armed countless hundreds of our folk with\r\nweapons taken from Salapanta field. These, led by the devils his sons,\r\nwith Philpritz cursed of the gods, be gone before to hold all the\r\nways be-east of you. Night and day have I ridden and run to warn you.\r\nHimself, with his main strength of devils ultramontane, rideth hot on\r\nyour tracks.”\r\n\r\nThey thanked him well, marvelling much that he should be at such pains\r\nto advertise them of their danger. “I have eat your salt,” answered he,\r\n“and moreover ye are against this naughty wicked baldhead that came\r\nover the mountains to oppress us. Therefore I would do you good. But\r\nI can little. For I am poor, that was rich in land and fee. And I am\r\nalone, that had formerly five hundred spearmen lodging in my halls to\r\ndo my pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“There’s need to do quickly that we do,” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “How\r\ngreat start of him hadst thou?”\r\n\r\n“He must be upon you in an hour or twain,” said Mivarsh, and fell\r\na-weeping.\r\n\r\n“To cope him in the open,” said Juss, “were great glory, and our\r\ncertain death.”\r\n\r\n“Give me to think, but a minute’s while,” said Brandoch Daha. And while\r\nthey busked them he walked musing by the lip of that ravine, switching\r\npebbles over the edge with his sword. Then he said, “This is without\r\ndoubt that stream Athrashah spoken of by Gro. O Mivarsh, runneth not\r\nthis flood of Athrashah south to the salt lakes of Ogo Morveo, and was\r\nthere not thereabout a hold named Eshgrar Ogo?”\r\n\r\nMivarsh answered, “This is so. But never heard I of any so witless\r\nas go thither. Here where we stand is the land fearsome enough; but\r\nEshgrar Ogo standeth at the very edge of the Moruna. No man hath\r\nharboured there these hundred years.”\r\n\r\n“Standeth it yet?” said Brandoch Daha.\r\n\r\n“For all I wot of,” answered Mivarsh.\r\n\r\n“Is it strong?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“In old times it was thought no place stronger,” answered Mivarsh. “But\r\nye were as well die here by the hand of the devils ultramontane, as\r\nthere be torn in pieces by bad spirits.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha turned him about to Juss. “It is resolved?” said he. Juss\r\nanswered, “Yea;” and forthwith they started at a great pace south along\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n“Methought you should have been gotten clean away ere this,” said\r\nMivarsh as they went. “This is but nine or ten days’ journey, and ’tis\r\nnow the sixteenth day since ye did leave me on Salapanta Hills.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha laughed. “Sixteenth!” said he. “Thou’lt be rich, Mivarsh,\r\nif thou reckon gold pieces o’ this fashion thou dost days. This is but\r\nour ninth day’s journey.”\r\n\r\nBut Mivarsh stood stoutly to it, saying that was the seventh day after\r\ntheir departure when Corund first came to Salapanta, “And I fleeing now\r\nnine days before his face chanced on your tracks, and now out of all\r\nexpectation on you.” Nor for all their mocking would he be turned from\r\nthis. And when, as they still pressed through the desert southward, the\r\nsun declined and set in a clear sky, behold the moon a little past her\r\nfull: and Juss saw that she was seven days older than on that night she\r\nwas when they came to Ishnain Nemartra. So he showed this wonder to\r\nBrandoch Daha and Spitfire, and much they marvelled.\r\n\r\n“You are much to thank me,” said Brandoch Daha, “that I kept you not a\r\nfull year awaiting of me. Beshrew me, but that seven days’ space seemed\r\nto me but an hour!”\r\n\r\n“Likely enow, to thee,” said Spitfire somewhat greenly. “But all we\r\nslept the week out on the cold stones, and I am half lamed yet with the\r\nache on’t.”\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said Juss, laughing; “I will not have thee blame him.”\r\n\r\nThe moon was high when they came to the salt lakes that lay one a\r\nlittle above the other in rocky basins. Their waters were like rough\r\nsilver, and the harsh face of the wilderness was black and silver in\r\nthe moonlight; and it was as a country of dead bones, blind and sterile\r\nbeneath the moon. Betwixt the lakes a rib of rock rose monstrous to\r\nan eminence crag-begirt on every side, with dark walls ringing it\r\nround above the cliffs. Thither they hastened, and as they climbed and\r\nstumbled among the crags a she-owl squeaked on the battlements and took\r\nwing ghost-like above their heads. The teeth of Mivarsh Faz chattered,\r\nbut right glad were the Demons as they won up the rocks and entered at\r\nlast into that deserted burg. Without, the night was still; but fires\r\nwere burning in the desert eastward, and others as they watched were\r\nkindled in the west, and soon was the circle joined of twinkling points\r\nof red round about Eshgrar Ogo and the lakes.\r\n\r\nJuss said, “By an hour have we forestalled them. And behold how he\r\nringeth us about as men ring a scorpion in flame.”\r\n\r\nSo they made all sure, and set the guard, and slept until past dawn.\r\nBut Mivarsh slept not, for terror of hob-thrushes from the Moruna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      XI: THE BURG OF ESHGRAR OGO\r\n\r\n  OF THE LORD CORUND’S BESIEGING OF THE BURG ABOVE THE LAKES OF OGO\r\n      MORVEO, AND WHAT BEFELL THERE BETWIXT HIM AND THE DEMONS;\r\n      WHEREIN IS ALSO AN EXAMPLE HOW THE SUBTLE OF HEART STANDETH AT\r\n      WHILES IN GREAT DANGER OF HIS DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Lord Corund knew of a surety that he held them of Demonland\r\nshut up in Eshgrar Ogo, he let dight supper in his tent, and made a\r\nsurfeit of venison pasties and heath-cocks and lobsters from the lakes.\r\nTherewith he drank nigh a skinful of sweet dark Thramnian wine, in such\r\nsort that an hour before midnight, becoming speechless, he was holpen\r\nby Gro to his couch and slept a great deep sleep till morning.\r\n\r\nGro watched in the tent, his right elbow propped on the table, his\r\ncheek resting on his hand, his left hand reaching forward with delicate\r\nfingers toying now with the sleek heavy perfumed masses of his beard,\r\nnow with the goblet whence he sipped ever and anon pale wine of\r\nPermio. His thoughts inconstant as insects in a summer garden flitted\r\never round and round, resting now on the scene before him, the great\r\nform of his general wrapt in slumber, now on other scenes sundered by\r\ngreat gulfs of time or weary leagues of perilous ways. So that in one\r\ninstant he saw in fancy that lady in Carcë welcoming her lord returned\r\nin triumph, and him, may be, crowned king of new-vanquished Impland;\r\nand in the next, swept from the future to the past, beheld again the\r\ngreat sending-off in Zajë Zaculo, Gaslark in his splendour on the\r\ngolden stairs saying adieu to those three captains and their matchless\r\narmament foredoomed to dogs and crows on Salapanta Hills; and always,\r\nlike a gloomy background darkening his mind, loomed the yawning void,\r\nfeatureless and vast, beyond the investing circle of Corund’s armies:\r\nthe blind blasted emptiness of the Moruna.\r\n\r\nWith such fancies, melancholy like a great bird settled upon his soul.\r\nThe lights flickered in their sockets, and for very weariness Gro’s\r\neyelids closed at length over his large liquid eyes; and, too tired to\r\nstir from his seat to seek his couch, he sank forward on the table, his\r\nhead pillowed on his arms. The red glow of the brazier slumbered ever\r\ndimmer and dimmer on the slender form and black shining curls of Gro,\r\nand on the mighty frame of Corund where he lay with one great spurred\r\nbooted leg stretched along the couch, and the other flung out sideways\r\nresting its heel on the ground.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIt wanted but two hours of noon when a sunbeam striking through an\r\nopening in the hangings of the tent shone upon Corund’s eyelids, and\r\nhe awoke fresh and brisk as a youth on a hunting morn. He waked Gro,\r\nand giving him a clap on the shoulder, “Thou wrongest a fair morn,” he\r\nsaid. “The devil damn me black as buttermilk if it be not great shame\r\nin thee; and I, that was born this day six and forty years as the years\r\ncome about, busy with mine affairs since sunrise.”\r\n\r\nGro yawned and smiled and stretched himself. “O Corund,” he said,\r\n“counterfeit a livelier wonder in thine eyes if thou wilt persuade me\r\nthou sawest the sunrise. For I think that were as new and unexampled a\r\nsight for thee as any I could produce to thee in Impland.”\r\n\r\nCorund answered, “Truly I was seldom so uncivil as surprise Madam\r\nAurora in her nightgown. And the thrice or four times I have been\r\nforced thereto, taught me it is an hour of crude airs and mists which\r\nbreed cold dark humours in the body, an hour when the torch of life\r\nburns weakest. Within there! bring me my morning draught.”\r\n\r\nThe boy brought two cups of white wine, and while they drank, “A\r\nthin ungracious drink is the well-spring,” said Corund: “a drink for\r\nqueasy-stomached skipjacks: for sand-levericks, not for men. And\r\nlike it is the day-spring: an ungrateful sapless hour, an hour for\r\nstab-i’-the-backs and cold-blooded betrayers. Ah, give me wine,” he\r\ncried, “and noon-day vices, and brazen-browed iniquities.”\r\n\r\n“Yet there’s many a deed of profit done by owl-light,” said Gro.\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Corund: “deeds of darkness: and there, my lord, I’m still\r\nthy scholar. Come, let’s be doing.” And taking his helm and weapons,\r\nand buckling about him his great wolfskin cloak, for the air was eager\r\nand frosty without, he strode forth. Gro wrapped himself in his fur\r\nmantle, drew on his lambskin gloves, and followed him.\r\n\r\n“If thou wilt take my rede,” said Lord Gro, as they looked on Eshgrar\r\nOgo stark in the barren sunlight, “thou’lt do this honour to Philpritz,\r\nwhich I question not he much desireth, to suffer him and his folk take\r\nfirst knock at this nut. It hath a hard look. Pity it were to waste\r\ngood Witchland blood in a first assault, when these vile instruments\r\nstand ready to our purpose.”\r\n\r\nCorund grunted in his beard, and with Gro at his elbow paced in silence\r\nthrough the lines, his keen eyes searching ever the cliffs and walls of\r\nEshgrar Ogo, till in some half-hour’s space he halted again before his\r\ntent, having made a complete circuit of the burg. Then he spake: “Put\r\nme in yonder fighting-stead, and if it were only but I and fifty able\r\nlads to man the walls, yet would I hold it against ten thousand.”\r\n\r\nGro held his peace awhile, and then said, “Thou speakest this in all\r\nsadness?”\r\n\r\n“In sober sadness,” answered Corund, squaring his shoulders at the burg.\r\n\r\n“Then thou’lt not assault it?”\r\n\r\nCorund laughed. “Not assault it, quotha! That were a sweet tale ’twixt\r\nthe boiled and the roast in Carcë: I’d not assault it!”\r\n\r\n“Yet consider,” said Gro, taking him by the arm. “So shapeth the matter\r\nin my mind: they be few and shut up in a little place, in this far\r\nland, out of reach and out of mind of all succour. Were they devils\r\nand not men, the multitude of our armies and thine own tried qualities\r\nmust daunt them. Be the place never so cocksure, doubt not some doubts\r\nthereof must poison their security. Therefore before thou risk a\r\nrepulse which must dispel those doubts use thine advantage. Bid Juss to\r\na parley. Offer him conditions: it skills not what. Bribe them out into\r\nthe open.”\r\n\r\n“A pretty plan,” said Corund. “Thou’lt merit wisdom’s crown if thou\r\ncanst tell me what conditions we can offer that they would take. And\r\nwhilst thou riddlest that, remember that though thou and I be masters\r\nhereabout, another reigns in Carcë.”\r\n\r\nLord Gro laughed gently. “Leave jesting,” he said, “O Corund, and never\r\nhope to gull me to believe thee such a babe in policy. Shall the King\r\nblame us though we sign away Demonland, ay and the wide world besides,\r\nto Juss to lure him forth? Unless indeed we were so neglectful of our\r\ninterest as suffer him, once forth, to elude our clutches.”\r\n\r\n“Gro,” said Corund, “I love thee. But hardly canst thou receive things\r\nas I receive them that have dealt all my days in great stripes, given\r\nand taken in the open field. I sticked not to take part in thy notable\r\ntreason against these poor snakes of Impland that we trapped in Orpish.\r\nAll’s fair against such dirt. Besides, great need was upon us then, and\r\nhard it is for an empty sack to stand straight. But here is far other\r\nmatter. All’s won here but the plucking of the apple: it is the very\r\nmain of my ambition to humble these Demons openly by the terror of my\r\nsword: wherefore I will not use upon them cogs and stops and all thy\r\ndevilish tricks, such as should bring me more of scorn than of glory in\r\nthe eyes of aftercomers.”\r\n\r\nSo speaking, he issued command and sent an herald to go forth beneath\r\nthe battlements with a flag of truce. And the herald cried aloud and\r\nsaid: “From Corund of Witchland unto the lords of Demonland: thus saith\r\nthe Lord Corund, ‘I hold this burg of Eshgrar Ogo as a nut betwixt the\r\ncrackers. Come down and speak with me in the batable land before the\r\nburg, and I swear to you peace and grith while we parley, and thereto\r\npledge I mine honour as a man of war.’”\r\n\r\nSo when the due ceremonies were performed, the Lord Juss came down\r\nfrom Eshgrar Ogo and with him the lords Spitfire and Brandoch Daha and\r\ntwenty men to be their bodyguard. Corund went to meet them with his\r\nguard about him, and his four sons that fared with him to Impland,\r\nHacmon, namely, and Heming and Viglus and Dormanes: sullen and dark\r\nyoung men, likely of look, of a little less fierceness than their\r\nfather. Gro, fair to see and slender as a racehorse, went at his side,\r\nmuffled to the ears in a cloak of ermine; and behind came Philpritz\r\nFaz helmed with a winged helm of iron and gold. A gilded corselet had\r\nPhilpritz, and trousers of panther’s skin, and he came a-slinking at\r\nCorund’s heel as the jackal slinks behind the lion.\r\n\r\nWhen they were met, Juss spake and said, “This would I know first, my\r\nLord Corund, how thou comest hither, and why, and by what right thou\r\ndisputest with us the ways eastward out of Impland.”\r\n\r\nCorund answered, leaning on his spear, “I need not answer thee in this.\r\nAnd yet I will. How came I? I answer thee, over the cold mountain\r\nwall of Akra Skabranth. And ’tis a feat hath not his fellow in man’s\r\nremembrance until now, with so great a force and in so short a space of\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis well enough,” said Juss. “I’ll grant thee thou hast outrun mine\r\nexpectations of thee.”\r\n\r\n“Next thou demandest why,” said Corund. “Suffice it for thee that the\r\nKing hath had advertisement of your farings into Impland and your\r\ndesigns therein. For to bring these to nought am I come.”\r\n\r\n“There was many firkins of wine drunk dry in Carcë,” said Hacmon, “and\r\nmany a noble person senseless and spewing on the ground ere morn for\r\npure delight, when cursed Goldry was made away. We were little minded\r\nthese healths should be proved vain at last.”\r\n\r\n“Was that ere thou rodest from Permio?” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “The\r\nmerry god wrought of our side that night, if my memory cheat not.”\r\n\r\n“Thou demandest last,” said Corund, “my Lord Juss, by what right I\r\nbar your passage eastaway. Know, therefore, that not of mine own\r\nself speak I unto you, but as vicar in wide-fronted Impland of our\r\nLord Gorice XII., King of Kings, most glorious and most great. There\r\nremaineth no way out for you from this place save into the rigour of\r\nmine hands. Therefore let us, according to the nature of great men,\r\nagree to honourable conditions. And this is mine offer, O Juss. Yield\r\nup this burg of Eshgrar Ogo, and therewith thy sealed word in a writing\r\nacknowledging our Lord the King to be King of Demonland and all ye his\r\nquiet and obedient subjects, even as we be. And I will swear unto you\r\nof my part, and in the name of our Lord the King, and give you hostages\r\nthereto, that ye shall depart in peace whither you list with all love\r\nand safety.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Juss scowled fiercely on him. “O Corund,” he said, “as little\r\nas we do understand the senseless wind, so little we understand thy\r\nword. Oft enow hath gray silver been in the fire betwixt us and you\r\nWitchlanders; for the house of Gorice fared ever like the foul toad,\r\nthat may not endure to smell the sweet savour of the vine when it\r\nflourisheth. So for this time we will abide in this hold, and withstand\r\nyour most grievous attempts.”\r\n\r\n“With free honesty and open heart,” said Corund, “I made thee this\r\noffer; which if thou refuse I am not thy lackey to renew it.”\r\n\r\nGro said, “It is writ and sealed, and wanteth but thy sign-manual, my\r\nLord Juss,” and with the word he made sign to Philpritz Faz that went\r\nto Lord Juss with a parchment. Juss put the parchment by, saying, “No\r\nmore: ye are answered,” and he was turning on his heel when Philpritz,\r\nlouting forward suddenly, gave him a great yerk beneath the ribs with a\r\ndagger slipped from his sleeve. But Juss wore a privy coat that turned\r\nthe dagger. Howbeit with the greatness of that stroke he staggered\r\naback.\r\n\r\nNow Spitfire clapped hand to sword, and the other Demons with him, but\r\nJuss loudly shouted that they should not be truce-breakers but know\r\nfirst what Corund would do. And Corund said, “Dost hear me, Juss? I had\r\nneither hand nor part in this.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha drew up his lip and said, “This is nought but what was to\r\nbe looked for. It is a wonder, O Juss, that thou shouldst hold out to\r\nsuch mucky dogs a hand without a whip in it.”\r\n\r\n“Such strokes come home or miss merely,” said Gro softly in Corund’s\r\near, and he hugged himself beneath his cloak, looking with furtive\r\namusement on the Demons. But Corund with a face red in anger said,\r\n“It is thine answer, O Juss?” And when Juss said, “It is our answer,\r\nO Corund,” Corund said violently, “Then red war I give you; and this\r\nwithal to testify our honour.” And he let lay hands on Philpritz Faz\r\nand with his own hand hacked the head from his body before the eyes\r\nof both their armies. Then in a great voice he said, “As bloodily as\r\nI have revenged the honour of Witchland on this Philpritz, so will I\r\nrevenge it on all of you or ever I draw off mine armies from these\r\nlakes of Ogo Morveo.”\r\n\r\nSo the Demons went up into the burg, and Gro and Corund home to their\r\ntents. “This was well thought on,” said Gro, “to flaunt the flag of\r\nseeming honesty, and with the motion rid us of this fellow that\r\npromised ever to grow thorns to make uneasy our seat in Impland.”\r\n\r\nCorund answered him not a word.\r\n\r\nIn that same hour Corund marshalled his folk and assaulted Eshgrar Ogo,\r\nplacing those of Impland in the van. They prospered not at all. Many a\r\nscore lay slain without the walls that night; and the obscene beasts\r\nfrom the desert feasted on their bodies by the light of the moon.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNext morning the Lord Corund sent an herald and bade the Demons again\r\nto a parley. And now he spake only to Brandoch Daha, bidding him\r\ndeliver up those brethren Juss and Spitfire, “And if thou wilt yield\r\nthem to my pleasure, then shalt thou and all thy people else depart in\r\npeace without conditions.”\r\n\r\n“An offer indeed,” said Lord Brandoch Daha; “if it be not in mockery.\r\nSay it loud, that my folk may hear.”\r\n\r\nCorund did so, and the Demons heard it from the walls of the burg.\r\n\r\nLord Brandoch Daha stood somewhat apart from Juss and Spitfire and\r\ntheir guard. “Libel it me out,” he said. “For good as I now must deem\r\nthy word, thine hand and seal must I have to show my followers ere they\r\nconsent with me in such a thing.”\r\n\r\n“Write thou,” said Corund to Gro. “To write my name is all my\r\nscholarship.” And Gro took forth his ink-horn and wrote in a great\r\nfair hand this offer on a parchment. “The most fearfullest oaths thou\r\nknowest,” said Corund; and Gro wrote them, whispering, “He mocketh us\r\nonly.” But Corund said, “No matter: ’tis a chance worth our chancing,”\r\nand slowly and with labour signed his name to the writing, and gave it\r\nto Lord Brandoch Daha.\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha read it attentively, and tucked it in his bosom beneath\r\nhis byrny. “This,” he said, “shall be a keepsake for me of thee, my\r\nLord Corund. Reminding me,” and here his eyes grew terrible, “so long\r\nas there surviveth a soul of you in Witchland, that I am still to teach\r\nthe world throughly what that man must abide that durst affront me with\r\nsuch an offer.”\r\n\r\nCorund answered him, “Thou art a dapper fellow. It is a wonder that\r\nthou wilt strut in the tented field with all this womanish gear. Thy\r\nshield: how many of these sparkling baubles thinkest thou I’d leave in\r\nit were we once come to knocks?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell thee,” answered Lord Brandoch Daha. “For every jewel that\r\nhath been beat out of my shield in battle, never yet went I to war that\r\nI brought not home an hundredfold to set it fair again, from the spoils\r\nI obtained from mine enemies. Now this will I bid thee, O Corund, for\r\nthy scornful words: I will bid thee to single combat, here and in this\r\nhour. Which if thou deny, then art thou an open and apparent dastard.”\r\n\r\nCorund chuckled in his beard, but his brow darkened somewhat. “I pray\r\nwhat age dost thou take me of?” said he. “I bare a sword when thou was\r\nyet in swaddling clothes. Behold mine armies, and what advantage I hold\r\nupon you. Oh, my sword is enchanted, my lord: it will not out of the\r\nscabbard.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha smiled disdainfully, and said to Spitfire, “Mark well, I\r\npray thee, this great lord of Witchland. How many true fingers hath a\r\nWitch on his left hand?”\r\n\r\n“As many as on his right,” said Spitfire.\r\n\r\n“Good. And how many on both?”\r\n\r\n“Two less than a deuce,” said Spitfire; “for they be false fazarts to\r\nthe fingers’ ends.”\r\n\r\n“Very well answered,” said Lord Brandoch Daha.\r\n\r\n“You’re pleasant,” Corund said. “But your fusty jibes move me not a\r\nwhit. It were a simple part indeed to take thine offer when all wise\r\ncounsels bid me use my power and crush you.”\r\n\r\n“Thou’dst kill me soon with thy mouth,” said Brandoch Daha. “In sum,\r\nthou art a brave man when it comes to roaring and swearing: a big\r\nbubber of wine, as men say to drink drunk is an ordinary matter with\r\nthee every day in the week; but I fear thou durst not fight.”\r\n\r\n“Doth not thy nose swell at that?” said Spitfire.\r\n\r\nBut Corund shrugged his shoulders. “A footra for your baits!” he\r\nanswered. “I am scarce bounden to do such a kindness to you of\r\nDemonland as lay down mine advantage and fight alone, against a\r\nsworder. Your old foxes are seldom taken in springes.”\r\n\r\n“I thought so,” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “Surely the frog will have\r\nhair sooner than any of you Witchlanders shall dare to stand me.”\r\n\r\nSo ended the second parley before Eshgrar Ogo. The same day Corund\r\nessayed again to storm the hold, and grievous was the battle and hard\r\nput to it were they of Demonland to hold the walls. Yet in the end were\r\nCorund’s men thrown back with great slaughter. And night fell, and they\r\nreturned to their tents.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\n“Mine invention,” said Gro, when on the next day they took counsel\r\ntogether, “hath yet some contrivance in her purse which shall do us\r\ngood, if it fall but out to our mind. But I doubt much it will dislike\r\nthee.”\r\n\r\n“Well, say it out, and I’ll give thee my censure on’t,” said Corund.\r\n\r\nGro spake: “It hath been shown we may not have down this tree by\r\nhewing above ground. Let’s dig about the roots. And first give them a\r\nseven-night’s space for reckoning up their chances, that they may see\r\nmorning and evening from the burg thine armies set down to invest them.\r\nThen, when their hopes are something sobered by that sight, and want of\r\naction hath trained their minds to sad reflection, call them to parley,\r\ngoing straight beneath the wall; and this time shalt thou address\r\nthyself only to the common sort, offering them all generous and free\r\nconditions thou canst think on. There’s little they can ask that we’d\r\nnot blithely grant them if they’ll but yield us up their captains.”\r\n\r\n“It mislikes me,” answered Corund. “Yet it may serve. But thou shalt be\r\nmy spokesman herein. For never yet went I cap in hand to ask favour of\r\nthe common muck o’ the world, nor I will not do it now.”\r\n\r\n“O but thou must,” said Gro. “Of thee they will receive in good faith\r\nwhat in me they would account but practice.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true enough,” said Corund. “But I cannot stomach it. Withal, I\r\nam too rough spoken.”\r\n\r\nGro smiled. “He that hath need of a dog,” he said, “calleth him ‘Sir\r\nDog.’ Come, come, I’ll school thee to it. Is it not a smaller thing\r\nthan months of tedious hardship in this frozen desert? Bethink thee\r\ntoo what honour it were to thee to ride home to Carcë with Juss and\r\nSpitfire and Brandoch Daha bounden in a string.”\r\n\r\nNot without much persuasion was Corund won to this. Yet at the last\r\nhe consented. For seven days and seven nights his armies sat before\r\nthe burg without sign; and on the eighth day he bade the Demons to\r\na parley, and when that was granted went with his sons and twenty\r\nmen-at-arms up the great rib of rock between the lakes, and stood below\r\nthe east wall of the burg. Bitter chill was the air that day. Powdery\r\nsnow light-fallen blew in little wisps along the ground, and the rocks\r\nwere slippery with an invisible coat of ice. Lord Gro, being troubled\r\nwith an ague, excused himself from that faring and kept his tent.\r\n\r\nCorund stood beneath the walls with his folk about him. “I have\r\nmatter of import,” he cried, “and ’tis needful it be heard both by\r\nthe highest and the lowest amongst you. Ere I begin, summon them all\r\nto this part of the walls: a look-out is enow to shield you of the\r\nother parts from any sudden onslaught, which besides I swear to you is\r\nclean without my purpose.” So when they were thick on the wall above\r\nhim, he began to say, “Soldiers of Demonland, against you had I never\r\nquarrel. Behold how in this Impland I have made freedom flourish as a\r\nflower. I have strook off the heads of Philpritz Faz, and Illarosh,\r\nand Lurmesh, and Gandassa, and Fax Fay Faz, that were the lords and\r\ngovernors here aforetime, abounding in all the bloody and crying sins,\r\noppression, gluttony, idleness, cruelty, and extortion. And of my\r\nclemency I delivered all their possessions unto their subjects to hold\r\nand order after their own will alone, who before did put on patience\r\nand endured with much heart-burning the tyranny of these Fazes, until\r\nby me they found a remedy for their more freedom. In like manner, not\r\nagainst you do I war, O men of Demonland; but against the tyrants that\r\nenforced you for their private gain to suffer hardship and death in\r\nthis remote country: namely, against Juss and Spitfire that came hither\r\nin quest of their cursed brother whom the might of the great King hath\r\nhappily removed. And against Brandoch Daha am I come, of insolence\r\nuntamed, who liveth a chambering idle life eating and drinking and\r\nexercising tyranny, while the pleasant lands of Krothering and Failze\r\nand Stropardon, and the dwellers in the isles, Sorbey, Morvey, Strufey,\r\nDalney, and Kenarvey, and they of Westmark and all the western parts\r\nof Demonland groan and wax lean to feed his luxury. To your hurt only\r\nhave these three led you, as cattle to the slaughter. Deliver them to\r\nme, that I may chastise them, and I, that am great viceroy of Impland,\r\nwill make you free and grant you lordships: a lordship for every man of\r\nyou in this my realm of Impland.”\r\n\r\nWhile Corund spake, the Lord Brandoch Daha went among the soldiers\r\nbidding them hold their peace and not murmur against Corund. But those\r\nthat were most hot for action he sent about an errand preparing what he\r\nhad in mind. So that when the Lord Corund ceased from his declaiming,\r\nall was ready to hand, and with one voice the soldiers of Lord Juss\r\nthat stood upon the wall cried out and said, “This is thy word, O\r\nCorund, and this our answer,” and therewith flung down upon him from\r\npots and buckets and every kind of vessel a deluge of slops and offal\r\nand all filth that came to hand. A bucketful took Corund in the mouth,\r\nbefouling all his great beard, so that he gave back spitting. And he\r\nand his, standing close beneath the wall, and little expecting so\r\nsudden and ill an answer, fared shamefully, being all well soused and\r\nbemerded with filth and lye.\r\n\r\nTherewith went up great shouts of laughter from the walls. But Corund\r\ncried out, “O filth of Demonland, this is my latest word with you. And\r\nthough ’twere ten years I must besiege this hold, yet will I take it\r\nover your heads. And very ill to do with shall ye find me in the end,\r\nand very puissant, proud, mighty, cruel, and bloody in my conquest.”\r\n\r\n“What, lads?” said Lord Brandoch Daha, standing on the battlements,\r\n“have we not fed this beast with pig-wash enow, but he must still be\r\nsnuffing and snouking at our gate? Give me another pailful.”\r\n\r\nSo the Witches returned to their tents with great shame. So hot was\r\nCorund in anger against the Demons, that he stayed not to eat nor drink\r\nat his coming down from Eshgrar Ogo, but straight gathered force and\r\nmade an assault upon the burg, the mightiest he had yet essayed; and\r\nhis picked men of Witchland were in that assault, and he himself to\r\nlead them. Thrice by main fury they won up into the hold, but all were\r\nslain who set foot therein, and Corund’s young son Dormanes wounded\r\nto the death. And at even they drew off from the battle. There fell\r\nin that fight an hundred and four-score Demons, and of the Imps five\r\nhundred, and of the Witches three hundred and ninety and nine. And many\r\nwere hurt of either side.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nWrath sat like thunder on Corund’s brow at supper-time. He ate his meat\r\nsavagely, thrusting great gobbets in his mouth, crunching the bones\r\nlike a beast, taking deep draughts of wine with every mouthful, which\r\nyet dispelled not his black mood. Over against him Gro sat silent,\r\nshivering now and then for all that he kept his ermine cloak about him\r\nand the brazier stood at his elbow. He made but a poor meal, drinking\r\nmulled wine in little sips and dipping little pieces of bread in it.\r\n\r\nSo wore without speech that cheerless and unkindly meal, until the Lord\r\nCorund, looking suddenly across the board at Gro and catching his eye\r\nstudying him, said, “That was a bright star of thine and then shined\r\nclear upon thee when thou tookest this bout of shivering fits and so\r\nwentest not with me to be soused with muck before the burg.”\r\n\r\n“Who would have dreamed,” answered Gro, “of their using so base and\r\nshameful a part?”\r\n\r\n“Not thou, I’ll swear,” said Corund, looking evilly upon him and\r\nmarking, as he thought, a twinkling light in Gro’s eyes. Gro shivered\r\nagain, sipped his wine, and shifted his glance uneasily under that\r\nunfriendly stare.\r\n\r\nCorund drank awhile in silence, then flushing suddenly a darker red,\r\nsaid, leaning heavily across the board at him, “Dost know why I said\r\n‘not thou’?”\r\n\r\n“’Twas scarce needful, to thy friend,” said Gro.\r\n\r\n“I said it,” said Corund, “because I know thou didst look for another\r\nthing when thou didst skulk shamming here.”\r\n\r\n“Another thing?”\r\n\r\n“Sit not there like some prim-mouthed miss feigning an innocence\r\nall know well thou hast not,” said Corund, “or I’ll kill thee. Thou\r\nplottedst my death with the Demons. And because thyself hast no shred\r\nof honour in thy soul, thou hadst not the wit to perceive that their\r\nnobility would shrink from such a betrayal as thy hopes entertained.”\r\n\r\nGro said, “This is a jest I cannot laugh at; or else ’tis madman’s\r\nbrabble.”\r\n\r\n“Dissembling cur,” said Corund, “be sure that I hold him not less\r\nguilty that holds the ladder than him that mounts the wall. It was thy\r\ndesign they should smite us at unawares when we went up to them with\r\nthis proposal thou didst urge on me so hotly.”\r\n\r\nGro made as if to rise. “Sit down!” said Corund. “Answer me; didst not\r\nthou egg on the poor snipe Philpritz to that attempt on Juss?”\r\n\r\n“He told me on’t,” said Gro.\r\n\r\n“O, thou art cunning,” said Corund. “There too I see thy treachery.\r\nHad they fallen upon us, thou mightest have thrown thyself safely upon\r\ntheir mercy.”\r\n\r\n“This is foolishness,” said Gro. “We were far stronger.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis so,” said Corund. “When did I charge thee with wisdom and sober\r\njudgement? With treachery I know thou art soaked wet.”\r\n\r\n“And thou art my friend!” said Gro.\r\n\r\nCorund said in a while, “I have long known thee to be both a subtle and\r\ndissembling fox, and now I durst trust thee no more, for fear I should\r\nfall further into thy danger. I am resolved to murther thee.”\r\n\r\nGro fell back in his chair and flung out his arms. “I have been here\r\nbefore,” he said. “I have beheld it, in moonlight and in the barren\r\nglare of day, in fair weather and in hail and snow, with the great\r\nwinds charging over the wastes. And I knew it was accursed. From Morna\r\nMoruna, ere I was born or thou, O Corund, or any of us, treason and\r\ncruelty blacker than night herself had birth, and brought death to\r\ntheir begetter and all his folk. From Morna Moruna bloweth this wind\r\nabout the waste to blast our love and bring us destruction. Ay, kill\r\nme; I’ll not ward myself, not i’ the smallest.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis small matter, Goblin,” said Corund, “whether thou shouldst or no.\r\nThou art but a louse between my fingers, to kill or cast away as shall\r\nseem me good.”\r\n\r\n“I was King Gaslark’s man,” said Gro, as if talking in a dream; “and\r\nbetween a man and a boy near fifteen years I served him true and\r\ncostly. Yet it was my fortune in all that time and at the ending\r\nthereof only to get a beard on my chin and remorse at heart. To\r\nwhat scorned purpose must I plot against him? Pity of Witchland, of\r\nWitchland sliding as then into the pit of adverse luck, ’twas that\r\nmade force upon me. And I served Witchland well: but fate ever fought\r\no’ the other side. I it was that counselled King Gorice XI. to draw\r\nout from the fight at Kartadza. Yet wanton Fortune trod down the scale\r\nfor Demonland. I prayed him not wrastle with Goldry in the Foliot\r\nIsles. Thou didst back me. Nought but rebukes and threats of death\r\ngat I therefrom; but because my redes were set at nought, evil fell\r\nupon Witchland. I helped our Lord the King when he conjured and made a\r\nsending against the Demons. He loved me therefor and upheld me, but\r\ngreat envy was raised up against me in Carcë for that fact. Yet I bare\r\nup, for thy friendship and thy lady wife’s were as bright fires to warm\r\nme against all the frosts of their ill-will. And now, for love of thee,\r\nI fared with thee to Impland. And here by the Moruna where in old days\r\nI wandered in danger and in sorrow, it is fitting I behold at length\r\nthe emptiness of all my days.”\r\n\r\nTherewith Gro fell silent a minute, and then began to say: “O Corund,\r\nI’ll strip bare my soul to thee before thou kill me. It is most true\r\nthat until now, sitting before Eshgrar Ogo, it hath been present to\r\nmy heart how great an advantage we held against the Demons, and the\r\nglory of their defence, so little a strength against us so many, and\r\nthe great glory of their flinging of us back, these things were a\r\nsplendour to my soul beholding them. Such glamour hath ever shone to me\r\nall my life’s days when I behold great men battling still beneath the\r\nbludgeonings of adverse fortune that, howsoever they be mine enemies,\r\nit lieth not in my virtue to withhold from admiration of them and well\r\nnigh love. But never was I false to thee, nor much less ever thought,\r\nas thou most unkindly accusest me, to compass thy destruction.”\r\n\r\n“Thou dost whine like a woman for thy life,” said Corund. “Cowardly\r\nhounds never stirred pity in me.” Yet he moved not, only looking dourly\r\non Gro.\r\n\r\nGro plucked forth his own sword, and pushed it towards Corund\r\nhilt-foremost across the board. “Such words are worse than\r\nsword-thrusts betwixt us twain,” said he. “Thou shalt see how I’ll\r\nwelcome death. The King will praise thee, when thou showest the cause.\r\nAnd it will be sweet news to Corinius and them that have held me in\r\ntheir hate, that thy love hath cast me off, and thou hast rid them of\r\nme at last.”\r\n\r\nBut Corund stirred not. After a space, he filled another cup, and\r\ndrank, and sat on. And Gro sat motionless before him. At last Corund\r\nrose heavily from his seat, and pushing Gro’s sword back across the\r\ntable, “Thou’dst best to bed,” said he. “But the night air’s o’er\r\nshrewd for thine ague. Sleep on my couch to-night.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe day dawned cold and gray, and with the dawn Corund ordered his\r\nlines round about Eshgrar Ogo and sat down for a siege. For ten days\r\nhe sat before the burg, and nought befell from dawn till night, from\r\nnight till dawn: only the sentinels walked on the walls and Corund’s\r\nfolk guarded their lines. On the eleventh day came a bank of fog\r\nrolling westward from the Moruna, chill and dank, blotting out the\r\nfeatures of the land. Snow fell, and the fog hung on the land, and\r\nnight came of such a pitchy blackness that even by torch-light a man\r\nmight not see his hand stretched forth at arm’s length before him. Five\r\ndays the fog held. On the fifth night, it being the twenty-fourth of\r\nNovember, in the darkness of the third hour after midnight, the alarm\r\nwas sounded and Corund summoned by a runner from the north with word\r\nthat a sally was made from Eshgrar Ogo, and the lines bursten through\r\nin that quarter, and fighting going forward in the mirk. Corund was\r\nscarce harnessed and gotten forth into the night, when a second runner\r\ncame hot-foot from the south with tidings of a great fight thereaway.\r\nAll was confounded in the dark, and nought certain, save that the\r\nDemons were broken out from Eshgrar Ogo. In a space, as Corund came\r\nwith his folk to the northern quarter and joined in the fight, came a\r\nmessage from his son Heming that Spitfire and a number with him were\r\nbroken out at the other side and gotten away westward, and a great band\r\nchasing him back towards Outer Impland; and therewith that more than\r\nan hundred Demons were surrounded and penned in by the shore of the\r\nlakes, and the burg entered and taken by Corund’s folk; but of Juss and\r\nBrandoch Daha no certain news, save that they were not of Spitfire’s\r\ncompany, but were with those against whom Corund went in person,\r\nhaving fared forth northaway. So went the battle through the night.\r\nCorund himself had sight of Juss, and exchanged shots with him with\r\ntwirl-spears in a lifting of the fog toward dawn, and a son of his bare\r\nwitness of Brandoch Daha in that same quarter, and had gotten a great\r\nwound from him.\r\n\r\nWhen night was past, and the Witches returned from the pursuit,\r\nCorund straitly questioned his officers, and went himself about the\r\nbattlefield hearing each man’s story and viewing the slain. Those\r\nDemons that were hemmed against the lakes had all lost their lives,\r\nand some were taken up dead in other parts, and some few alive. These\r\nwould his officers let slay, but Corund said, “Since I am king in\r\nImpland, till that the King receive it of me, it is not this handful\r\nof earth-lice shall shake my safety here; and I may well give them\r\ntheir lives, that fought sturdily against us.” So he gave them peace.\r\nAnd he said unto Gro, “Better that for every Demon dead in Ogo Morveo\r\nten should rise up against us, if but Juss only and Brandoch Daha were\r\nslain.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be in the tale with thee, if thou wilt proclaim them dead,” said\r\nGro. “And nothing is likelier, if they be gone with but two or three on\r\nto the Moruna, than that such a tale should come true ere it were told\r\nin Carcë.”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw!” said Corund, “to the devil with such false feathers. What’s\r\ndone shows brave enow without them: Impland conquered, Juss’s army\r\nminced to a gallimaufry, himself and Brandoch Daha chased like runaway\r\nthralls up on the Moruna. Where if devils tear them, ’tis my best wish\r\ncome true. If not, thou’lt hear of them, be sure. Dost think these can\r\nsurvive on earth and not raise a racket that shall be heard from hence\r\nto Carcë?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        XII: KOSHTRA PIVRARCHA\r\n\r\n  OF THE COMING OF THE LORDS OF DEMONLAND TO MORNA MORUNA, WHENCE\r\n      THEY BEHELD THE ZIMIAMVIAN MOUNTAINS, SEEN ALSO BY GRO IN YEARS\r\n      GONE BY; AND OF THE WONDERS SEEN BY THEM AND PERILS UNDERGONE\r\n      AND DEEDS DONE IN THEIR ATTEMPT ON KOSHTRA PIVRARCHA, THE\r\n      WHICH ALONE OF ALL EARTH’S MOUNTAINS LOOKETH DOWN UPON KOSHTRA\r\n      BELORN; AND NONE SHALL ASCEND UP INTO KOSHTRA BELORN THAT HATH\r\n      NOT FIRST LOOKED DOWN UPON HER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it is to be said of Lord Juss and Lord Brandoch Daha that they,\r\nfinding themselves parted from their people in the fog, and utterly\r\nunable to find them, when the last sound of battle had died away\r\nwiped and put up their bloody swords and set forth at a great pace\r\neastward. Only Mivarsh fared with them of all their following. His\r\nlips were drawn back a little, showing his teeth, but he carried\r\nhimself proudly as one who being resolved to die walks with a quiet\r\nmind to his destruction. Day after day they journeyed, sometimes in\r\nclear weather, sometimes in mist or sleet, over the changeless desert,\r\nwithout a landmark, save here a little sluggish river, or here a piece\r\nof rising ground, or a pond, or a clump of rocks: small things which\r\nfaded from sight amid the waste ere they were passed by a half-mile’s\r\ndistance. So was each day like yesterday, drawing to a morrow like to\r\nit again. And always fear walked at their heel and sat beside them\r\nsleeping: clanking of wings heard above the wind, a brooding hush of\r\nmenace in the sunshine, and noises out of the void of darkness as of\r\nteeth chattering. So came they on the twentieth day to Morna Moruna,\r\nand stood at even in the sorrowful twilight by the little round castle,\r\nsilent on Omprenne Edge.\r\n\r\nFrom their feet the cliffs dropped sheer. Strange it was, standing on\r\nthat frozen lip of the Moruna, as on the limit of the world, to gaze\r\nsouthward on a land of summer, and to breathe faint summer airs blowing\r\nup from blossoming trees and flower-clad alps. In the depths a carpet\r\nof huge tree-tops clothed a vast stretch of country, through the midst\r\nof which, seen here and there in a bend of silver among the woods, the\r\nBhavinan bore the waters of a thousand secret mountain solitudes down\r\nto an unknown sea. Beyond the river the deep woods, blue with distance,\r\nswelled to feathery hill-tops with some sharper-featured loftier\r\nheights bodying cloudily beyond them. The Demons strained their eyes\r\nsearching the curtain of mystery behind and above those foot-hills; but\r\nthe great peaks, like great ladies, shrouded themselves against their\r\ncurious gaze, and no glimpse was shown them of the snows.\r\n\r\nSurely to be in Morna Moruna was to be in the death chamber of some\r\nonce lovely presence. Stains of fire were on the walls. The fair\r\ngallery of open wood-work that ran above the main hall was burnt\r\nthrough and partly fallen in ruin, the blackened ends of the beams that\r\nheld it jutting blindly in the gap. Among the wreck of carved chairs\r\nand benches, broken and worm-eaten, some shreds of figured tapestries\r\nrotted, the home now of beetles and spiders. Patches of colour, faded\r\nlines, mildewed and damp with the corruption of two hundred years,\r\nlingered to be the memorials, like the mummied skeleton of a king’s\r\ndaughter long ago untimely dead, of sweet gracious paintings on the\r\nwalls. Five nights and five days the Demons and Mivarsh dwelt in Morna\r\nMoruna, inured to portents till they marked them as little as men mark\r\nswallows at their window. In the still night were flames seen, and\r\nflying forms dim in the moonlit air; and in moonless nights unstarred,\r\nmoans heard and gibbering accents: prodigies beside their beds, and\r\nridings in the sky, and fleshless fingers plucking at Juss unseen when\r\nhe went forth to make question of the night.\r\n\r\nCloud and mist abode ever in the south, and only the foot-hills showed\r\nof the great ranges beyond Bhavinan. But on the evening of the sixth\r\nday before Yule, it being the nineteenth of December when Betelgeuze\r\nstands at midnight on the meridian, a wind blew out of the north-west\r\nwith changing fits of sleet and sunshine. Day was fading as they\r\nstood above the cliff. All the forest land was blue with shades of\r\napproaching night: the river was dull silver: the wooded heights\r\nafar mingled their outlines with the towers and banks of turbulent\r\ndeep blue vapour that hurtled in ceaseless passage through the upper\r\nair. Suddenly a window opened in the clouds to a space of clean wan\r\nwind-swept sky high above the shaggy hills. Surely Juss caught his\r\nbreath in that moment, to see those deathless ones where they shone\r\npavilioned in the pellucid air, far, vast, and lonely, most like to\r\ncreatures of unascended heaven, of wind and of fire all compact, too\r\npure to have aught of the gross elements of earth or water. It was as\r\nif the rose-red light of sun-down had been frozen to crystal and these\r\nhewn from it to abide to everlasting, strong and unchangeable amid\r\nthe welter of earthborn mists below and tumultuous sky above them.\r\nThe rift ran wider, eastward and westward, opening on more peaks and\r\nsunset-kindled snows. And a rainbow leaning to the south was like a\r\nsword of glory across the vision.\r\n\r\nMotionless, like hawks staring from that high place of prospect, Juss\r\nand Brandoch Daha looked on the mountains of their desire.\r\n\r\nJuss spake, haltingly as one talking in a dream. “The sweet smell,\r\nthis gusty wind, the very stone thy foot standeth on: I know them all\r\nbefore. There’s not a night since we sailed out of Lookinghaven that I\r\nhave not beheld in sleep these mountains and known their names.”\r\n\r\n“Who told thee their names?” asked Lord Brandoch Daha.\r\n\r\n“My dream,” Juss answered. “And first I dreamed it in mine own bed in\r\nGaling when I came home from guesting with thee last June. And they be\r\ntrue dreams that are dreamed there.” And he said, “Seest thou where the\r\nfoot-hills part to a dark valley that runneth deep into the chain, and\r\nthe mountains are bare to view from crown to foot? Mark where, beyond\r\nthe nearer range, bleak-visaged precipices, cobweb-streaked with huge\r\nsnow corridors, rise to a rampart where the rock towers stand against\r\nthe sky. This is the great ridge of Koshtra Pivrarcha, and the loftiest\r\nof those spires his secret mountain-top.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, his eye followed the line of the eastern ridge, where the\r\ntowers, like dark gods going down from heaven, plunge to a parapet\r\nwhich runs level above a curtain of avalanche-fluted snow. He fell\r\nsilent as his gaze rested on the sister peak that east of the gap\r\nflamed skyward in wild cliffs to an airy snowy summit, soft-lined as a\r\nmaiden’s cheek, purer than dew, lovelier than a dream.\r\n\r\nWhile they looked the sunset fires died out upon the mountains, leaving\r\nonly pale hues of death and silence. “If thy dream,” said Lord Brandoch\r\nDaha, “conducted thee down this Edge, over the Bhavinan, through\r\nyonder woods and hills, up through the leagues of ice and frozen rock\r\nthat stand betwixt us and the main ridge, up by the right road to the\r\ntopmost snows of Koshtra Belorn: that were a dream indeed.”\r\n\r\n“All this it showed me,” said Juss, “up to the lowest rocks of the\r\ngreat north buttress of Koshtra Pivrarcha, that must first be scaled\r\nby him that would go up to Koshtra Belorn. But beyond those rocks not\r\neven a dream hath ever climbed. Ere the light fades, I’ll show thee our\r\npass over the nearer range.” He pointed where a glacier crawled betwixt\r\nshadowy walls down from a torn snow-field that rose steeply to a\r\nsaddle. East of it stood two white peaks, and west of it a sheer-faced\r\nand long-backed mountain like a citadel, squat and dark beneath the\r\nwild sky-line of Koshtra Pivrarcha that hung in air beyond it.\r\n\r\n“The Zia valley,” said Juss, “that runneth into Bhavinan. There lieth\r\nour way: under that dark bastion called by the Gods Tetrachnampf.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nOn the morrow Lord Brandoch Daha came to Mivarsh Faz and said, “It is\r\nneedful that this day we go down from Omprenne Edge. I would for no\r\nsake leave thee on the Moruna, but ’tis no walking matter to descend\r\nthis wall. Art thou a cragsman?”\r\n\r\n“I was born,” answered he, “in the high valley of Perarshyn by the\r\nupper waters of the Beirun in Impland. There boys scarce toddle\r\nere they can climb a rock. This climb affrights me not, nor those\r\nmountains. But the land is unknown and terrible, and many loathly\r\nones inhabit it, ghosts and eaters of men. O devils transmarine, and\r\nmy friends, is it not enough? Let us turn again, and if the Gods save\r\nour lives we shall be famous for ever, that came unto Morna Moruna and\r\nreturned alive.”\r\n\r\nBut Juss answered and said, “O Mivarsh Faz, know that not for fame\r\nare we come on this journey. Our greatness already shadoweth all the\r\nworld, as a great cedar tree spreading his shadow in a garden; and\r\nthis enterprise, mighty though it be, shall add to our glory only so\r\nmuch as thou mightest add to these forests of the Bhavinan by planting\r\nof one more tree. But so it is, that the great King of Witchland,\r\npractising in darkness in his royal palace of Carcë such arts of\r\ngrammarie and sendings magical as the world hath not been grieved\r\nwith until now, sent an ill thing to take my brother, the Lord Goldry\r\nBluszco, who is dear to me as mine own soul. And They that dwell in\r\nsecret sent me word in a dream, bidding me, if I would have tidings of\r\nmy dear brother, inquire in Koshtra Belorn. Therefore, O Mivarsh, go\r\nwith us if thou wilt, but if thou wilt not, why, fare thee well. For\r\nnought but my death shall stay me from going thither.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mivarsh, bethinking him that if the mantichores of the mountains\r\nshould devour him along with those two lords, that were yet a kindlier\r\nfate than all alone to abide those things he wist of on the Moruna, put\r\non the rope, and after commending himself to the protection of his gods\r\nfollowed Lord Brandoch Daha down the rotten slopes of rock and frozen\r\nearth at the head of a gully leading down the cliff.\r\n\r\nFor all that they were early afoot, yet was it high noon ere they were\r\noff the rocks. For the peril of falling stones drove them out from\r\nthe gully’s bed first on to the eastern buttress and after, when that\r\ngrew too sheer, back to the western wall. And in an hour or twain the\r\ngully’s bed grew shallow and it narrowed to an end, whence Brandoch\r\nDaha gazed between his feet to where, a few spear’s lengths below, the\r\nsmooth slabs curved downward out of sight and the eye leapt straight\r\nfrom their clean-cut edge to shimmering tree-tops that showed tiny\r\nas mosses beyond the unseen gulf of air. So they rested awhile; then\r\nreturning a little up the gully forced a way out on to the face and\r\nmade a hazardous traverse to a new gully westward of the first, and so\r\nat last plunged down a long fan of scree and rested on soft fine turf\r\nat the foot of the cliffs.\r\n\r\nLittle mountain gentians grew at their feet; the pathless forest\r\nlay like the sea below them; before them the mountains of the Zia\r\nstood supreme: the white gables of Islargyn, the lean dark finger of\r\nTetrachnampf nan Tshark lying back above the Zia Pass pointing to the\r\nsky, and west of it, jutting above the valley, the square bastion\r\nof Tetrachnampf nan Tsurm. The greater mountains were for the most\r\npart sunk behind this nearer range, but Koshtra Belorn still towered\r\nabove the Pass. As a queen looking down from her high window, so\r\nshe overlooked those green woods sleeping in the noon-day; and on\r\nher forehead was beauty like a star. Behind them where they sat, the\r\nescarpment reared back in cramped perspective, a pile of massive\r\nbuttresses cleft with ravines leading upward from that land of leaves\r\nand waters to the hidden wintry flats of the Moruna.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThat night they slept on the fell under the stars, and next day, going\r\ndown into the woods, came at dusk to an open glade by the waters of the\r\nbroad-bosomed Bhavinan. The turf was like a cushion, a place for elves\r\nto dance in. The far bank full half a mile away was wooded to the water\r\nwith silver birches, dainty as mountain nymphs, their limbs gleaming\r\nthrough the twilight, their reflections quivering in the depths of the\r\nmighty river. In the high air day lingered yet, a faint warmth tingeing\r\nthe great outlines of the mountains, and westward up the river the\r\nyoung moon stooped above the trees. East of the glade a little wooded\r\neminence, no higher than a house, ran back from the river bank, and in\r\nits shoulder a hollow cave.\r\n\r\n“How smiles it to thee?” said Juss. “Be sure we shall find no better\r\nplace than this thou seest to dwell in until the snows melt and we\r\nmay on. For though it be summer all the year round in this fortunate\r\nvalley, it is winter on the great hills, and until the spring we were\r\nmad to essay our enterprise.”\r\n\r\n“Why then,” said Brandoch Daha, “turn we shepherds awhile. Thou shalt\r\npipe to me, and I’ll foot thee measures shall make the dryads think\r\nthey ne’er went to school. And Mivarsh shall be a goat-foot god to\r\nchase them; for to tell thee truth country wenches are long grown\r\ntedious to me. O, ’tis a sweet life. But ere we fall to it, bethink\r\nthee, O Juss: time marcheth, and the world waggeth: what goeth forward\r\nin Demonland till summer be come and we home again?”\r\n\r\n“Also my heart is heavy because of my brother Spitfire,” said Juss. “O,\r\n’twas an ill storm, and ill delays.”\r\n\r\n“Away with vain regrettings,” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “For thy sake\r\nand thy brother’s fared I on this journey, and it is known to thee that\r\nnever yet stretched I out mine hand upon aught that I have not taken\r\nit, and had my will of it.”\r\n\r\nSo they made their dwelling in that cave beside deep-eddying Bhavinan,\r\nand before that cave they ate their Yule feast, the strangest they\r\nhad eaten all the days of their lives: seated, not as of old, on\r\ntheir high seats of ruby or of opal, but on mossy banks where daisies\r\nslept and creeping thyme; lighted not by the charmed escarbuncle of\r\nthe high presence chamber in Galing, but by the shifting beams of a\r\nbrushwood fire that shone not on those pillars crowned with monsters\r\nthat were the wonder of the world but on the mightier pillars of the\r\nsleeping beechwoods. And in place of that feigned heaven of jewels\r\nself-effulgent beneath the golden canopy at Galing, they ate pavilioned\r\nunder a charmed summer night, where the great stars of winter, Orion,\r\nSirius, and the Little Dog, were raised up near the zenith, yielding\r\ntheir known courses in the southern sky to Canopus and the strange\r\nstars of the south. When the trees spake, it was not with their winter\r\nvoice of bare boughs creaking, but with whisper of leaves and beetles\r\ndroning in the fragrant air. The bushes were white with blossom, not\r\nwith hoar-frost, and the dim white patches under the trees were not\r\nsnow, but wild lilies and wood anemones sleeping in the night.\r\n\r\nAll the creatures of the forest came to that feast, for they were\r\nwithout fear, having never looked upon the face of man. Little\r\ntree-apes, and popinjays, and titmouses, and coalmouses, and wrens, and\r\ngentle round-eyed lemurs, and rabbits, and badgers, and dormice, and\r\npied squirrels, and beavers from the streams, and storks, and ravens,\r\nand bustards, and wombats, and the spider-monkey with her baby at her\r\nbreast: all these came to gaze with curious eye upon those travellers.\r\nAnd not these alone, but fierce beasts of the woods and wildernesses:\r\nthe wild buffalo, the wolf, the tiger with monstrous paws, the bear,\r\nthe fiery-eyed unicorn, the elephant, the lion and she-lion in their\r\nmajesty, came to behold them in the firelight in that quiet glade.\r\n\r\n“It seems we hold court in the woods to-night,” said Lord Brandoch\r\nDaha. “It is very pleasant. Yet hold thee ready with me to put some\r\nfire-brands amongst ’em if need befall. ’Tis likely some of these great\r\nbeasts are little schooled in court ceremonies.”\r\n\r\nJuss answered, “And thou lovest me, do no such thing. There lieth this\r\ncurse upon all this land of the Bhavinan, that whoso, whether he be man\r\nor beast, slayeth in this land or doeth here any deed of violence,\r\nthere cometh down a curse upon him that in that instant must destroy\r\nand blast him for ever off the face of the earth. Therefore it was\r\nI took away from Mivarsh his bow and arrows when we came down from\r\nOmprenne Edge, lest he should kill game for us and so a worse thing\r\nbefall him.”\r\n\r\nMivarsh harkened not, but sat all a-quake, looking intently on a\r\ncrocodile that came ponderously out upon the bank. And now he began to\r\nscream with terror, crying, “Save me! let me fly! give me my weapons!\r\nIt was foretold me by a wise woman that a cocadrill-serpent must devour\r\nme at last!” Whereat the beasts drew back uneasily, and the crocodile,\r\nhis small eyes wide, startled by Mivarsh’s cries and violent gestures,\r\nlurched with what speed he might back into the water.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow in that place Lord Juss and Lord Brandoch Daha and Mivarsh Faz\r\nabode for four moons’ space. Nothing they lacked of meat and drink,\r\nfor the beasts of the forest, finding them well disposed, brought them\r\nof their store. Moreover, there came flying from the south, about the\r\nending of the year, a martlet which alighted in Juss’s bosom and said\r\nto him, “The gentle Queen Sophonisba, fosterling of the Gods, had news\r\nof your coming. And because she knoweth you both mighty men of your\r\nhands and high of heart, therefore by me she sent you greeting.”\r\n\r\nJuss said, “O little martlet, we would see thy Queen face to face, and\r\nthank her.”\r\n\r\n“Ye must thank her,” said the bird, “in Koshtra Belorn.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha said, “That shall we fulfil. Thither only do our thoughts\r\nintend.”\r\n\r\n“Your greatness,” said the martlet, “must approve that word. And know\r\nthat it is easier to lay under you all the world in arms than to ascend\r\nup afoot into that mountain.”\r\n\r\n“Thy wings were too weak to lift me, else I’d borrow them,” said\r\nBrandoch Daha.\r\n\r\nBut the martlet answered, “Not the eagle that flieth against the sun\r\nmay alight on Koshtra Belorn. No foot may tread her, save of those\r\nblessed ones to whom the Gods gave leave ages ago, till they be come\r\nthat the patient years await: men like unto the Gods in beauty and in\r\npower, who of their own might and main, unholpen by magic arts, shall\r\nforce a passage up to her silent snows.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha laughed. “Not the eagle?” he cried, “but thou, little\r\nflitter-jack?”\r\n\r\n“Nought that hath feet,” said the martlet. “I have none.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Brandoch Daha took it tenderly in his hand and held it high in\r\nthe air, looking to the high lands in the south. The birches swaying\r\nby the Bhavinan were not more graceful nor the distant mountain-crags\r\nbehind them more untameable to behold than he. “Fly to thy Queen,” he\r\nsaid, “and say thou spakest with Lord Juss beside the Bhavinan and with\r\nLord Brandoch Daha of Demonland. Say unto her that we be they that were\r\nfor to come; and that we, of our own might and main, ere spring be well\r\nturned summer, will come up to her in Koshtra Belorn to thank her for\r\nher gracious sendings.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow when it was April, and the sun moving among the signs of heaven was\r\nabout departing out of Aries and entering into Taurus, and the melting\r\nof the snows in the high mountains had swollen all the streams to\r\nspate, filling the mighty river so that he brimmed his banks and swept\r\nby like a tide-race, Lord Juss said, “Now is the season propitious\r\nfor our crossing of the flood of Bhavinan and setting forth into the\r\nmountains.”\r\n\r\n“Willingly,” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “But shall’s walk it, or swim it,\r\nor take to us wings? To me, that have many a time swum back and forth\r\nover Thunderfirth to whet mine appetite ere I brake my fast, ’tis a\r\nsmall matter of this river stream howso swift it runneth. But with our\r\nharness and weapons and all our gear, that were far other matter.”\r\n\r\n“Is it for nought we are grown friends with them that do inhabit these\r\nwoods?” said Juss. “The crocodile shall bear us over Bhavinan for the\r\nasking.”\r\n\r\n“It is an ill fish,” said Mivarsh; “and it sore dislikes me.”\r\n\r\n“Then here thou must abide,” said Brandoch Daha. “But be not dismayed,\r\nI will go with thee. The fish may bear us both at a draught and not\r\nfounder.”\r\n\r\n“It was a wise woman foretold it me,” answered Mivarsh, “that such a\r\nkind of serpent must be my bane. Yet be it according to your will.”\r\n\r\nSo they whistled them up the crocodile; and first the Lord Juss fared\r\nover Bhavinan, riding on the back of that serpent with all his gear and\r\nweapons of war, and landed several hundred paces down stream for the\r\nstream was very strong; and thereafter the crocodile returning to the\r\nnorth bank took the Lord Brandoch Daha and Mivarsh Faz and put them\r\nacross in like manner. Mivarsh put on a gallant face, but rode as near\r\nthe tail as might be, fingering certain herbs from his wallet that were\r\ngood against serpents, his lips moving in urgent supplication to his\r\ngods. When they were come ashore they thanked the crocodile and bade\r\nhim farewell and went their way swiftly through the woods. And Mivarsh,\r\nas one new loosed from prison, went before them with a light step,\r\nsinging and snapping his fingers.\r\n\r\nNow had they for three days or four a devious journey through the\r\nfoot-hills, and thereafter made their dwelling for forty days’ space\r\nin the Zia valley, above the gorges. Here the valley widens to a\r\nflat-floored amphitheatre, and lean limestone crags tower heavenward on\r\nevery side. High in the south, couched above great gray moraines, the\r\nZia glacier, wrinkle-backed like some dragon survived out of the elder\r\nchaos, thrusts his snout into the valley. Here out of his caves of\r\nice the young river thunders, casting up a spray where rainbows hover\r\nin bright weather. The air blows sharp from the glacier, and alpine\r\nflowers and shrubs feed on the sunlight.\r\n\r\nHere they gathered them good store of food. And every morning they were\r\nafoot before the sunrise, to ascend the mountains and make sure their\r\npractice ere they should attempt the greater peaks. So they explored\r\nall the spurs of Tetrachnampf and Islargyn, and those peaks themselves;\r\nthe rock peaks of the lower Nuanner range overlooking Bhavinan; the\r\nsnow peaks east of Islargyn: Avsek, Kiurmsur, Myrsu, Byrshnargyn, and\r\nBorch Mehephtharsk, loftiest of the range, by all his ridges, dwelling\r\na week on the moraines of the Mehephtharsk glacier above the upland\r\nvalley of Foana; and westward the dolomite group of Burdjazarshra and\r\nthe great wall of Shilack.\r\n\r\nNow were their muscles by these exercises grown like bands of iron,\r\nand they hardy as mountain bears and sure of foot as mountain goats.\r\nSo on the ninth day of May they crossed the Zia Pass and camped on the\r\nrocks under the south wall of Tetrachnampf nan Tshark. The sun went\r\ndown, like blood, in a cloudless sky. On either hand and before them,\r\nthe snows stretched blue and silent. The air of those high snowfields\r\nwas bitter cold. A league and more to the south a line of black cliffs\r\nbounded the glacier-basin. Over that black wall, twelve miles away,\r\nKoshtra Belorn and Koshtra Pivrarcha towered against an opal heaven.\r\n\r\nWhile they supped in the fading light, Juss said, “The wall thou seest\r\nis called the Barriers of Emshir. Though over it lieth the straight\r\nway to Koshtra Pivrarcha, yet is it not our way, but an ill way. For,\r\nfirst, that barrier hath till now been held unclimbable, and so proven\r\neven by half-gods that alone assayed it.”\r\n\r\n“I await not thy second reason,” said Brandoch Daha. “Thou hast had thy\r\nway until now, and now thou shalt give me mine in this, to come with me\r\nto-morrow and show how thou and I make of such barriers a puff of smoke\r\nif they stand in the path between us and our fixed ends.”\r\n\r\n“Were it only this,” answered Juss, “I would not gainsay thee. But\r\nnot senseless rocks alone are we set to deal with if we take this\r\nroad. Seest thou where the Barriers end in the east against yonder\r\nmonstrous pyramid of tumbled crags and hanging glaciers that shuts\r\nout our prospect eastaway? Menksur men call it, but in heaven it\r\nhath a more dreadful name: Ela Mantissera, which is to say, the Bed\r\nof the Mantichores. O Brandoch Daha, I will climb with thee what\r\nunscaled cliff thou list, and I will fight with thee against the most\r\ngrisfullest beasts that ever grazed by the Tartarian streams. But\r\nboth these things in one moment of time, that were a rash part and a\r\nfoolish.”\r\n\r\nBut Brandoch Daha laughed, and answered him, “To nought else may I\r\nliken thee, O Juss, but to the sparrow-camel. To whom they said, ‘Fly,’\r\nand it answered, ‘I cannot, for I am a camel’; and when they said,\r\n‘Carry,’ it answered, ‘I cannot, for I am a bird.’”\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou egg me on so much?” said Juss.\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Brandoch Daha, “if thou wilt be assish.”\r\n\r\n“Wilt thou quarrel?” said Juss.\r\n\r\n“Thou knowest me,” said Brandoch Daha.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Juss, “thy counsel hath been right once and saved us, for\r\nnine times that it hath been wrong, and my counsel saved thee from an\r\nevil end. If ill behap us, it shall be set down that it had from thy\r\npeevish will original.” And they wrapped them in their cloaks and slept.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow they rose betimes and set forth south across the snows\r\nthat were crisp and hard for the frosts of the night. The Barriers, as\r\nit were but a stone’s-throw removed, stood black before them; starlight\r\nswallowed up size and distance that showed only by walking, as still\r\nthey walked and still that wall seemed no nearer nor no larger. Twice\r\nand thrice they dipped into a valley or crossed a raised-up fold of\r\nthe glacier; till they stood at break of day below the smooth blank\r\nwall frozen and bleak, with never a ledge in sight great enough to bear\r\nsnow, barring their passage southward.\r\n\r\nThey halted and ate and scanned the wall before them. And ill to do\r\nwith it seemed. So they searched for an ascent, and found at last a\r\nspot where the glacier swelled higher, a mile or less from the western\r\nshoulder of Ela Mantissera. Here the cliff was but four or five hundred\r\nfeet high; yet smooth enow and ill enow to look on; yet their likeliest\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nSome while it was ere they might get a footing on that wall, but at\r\nlength Brandoch Daha, standing on Juss’s shoulder, found him a hold\r\nwhere no hold showed from below, and with great travail fought a\r\npassage up the rock to a stance some hundred feet above them, whence\r\nsitting sure on a broad ledge great enough to hold six or seven folk\r\nat a time he played up Lord Juss on the rope and after him Mivarsh. An\r\nhour and a half it cost them for that short climb.\r\n\r\n“The north-east buttress of Ill Stack was children’s gruel to this,”\r\nsaid Lord Juss.\r\n\r\n“There’s more aloft,” said Lord Brandoch Daha, lying back against the\r\nprecipice, his hands clasped behind his head, his feet a-dangle over\r\nthe ledge. “In thine ear, Juss: I would not go first on the rope again\r\non such a pitch for all the wealth of Impland.”\r\n\r\n“Wilt repent and return?” said Juss.\r\n\r\n“If thou’lt be last down,” he answered. “If not, I’d liever risk what\r\nwaits untried above us. If it prove worse, I am confirmed atheist.”\r\n\r\nLord Juss leaned out, holding by the rock with his right hand,\r\nscanning the wall beside and above them. An instant he hung so, then\r\ndrew back. His square jaw was set, and his teeth glinted under his dark\r\nmoustachios something fiercely, as a thunder-beam betwixt dark sky and\r\nsea in a night of thunder. His nostrils widened, as of a war-horse at\r\nthe call of battle; his eyes were like the violet levin-brand, and all\r\nhis body hardened like a bowstring drawn as he grasped his sharp sword\r\nand pulled it forth grating and singing from its sheath.\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha sprang afoot and drew his sword, Zeldornius’s loom. “What\r\nstirreth?” he cried. “Thou look’st ghastly. That look thou hadst when\r\nthou tookest the helm and our prows swung westward toward Kartadza\r\nSound, and the fate of Demonland and all the world beside hung in thine\r\nhand for wail or bliss.”\r\n\r\n“There’s little sword-room,” said Juss. And again he looked forth\r\neastward and upward along the cliff. Brandoch Daha looked over his\r\nshoulder. Mivarsh took his bow and set an arrow on the string.\r\n\r\n“It hath scented us down the wind,” said Brandoch Daha.\r\n\r\nSmall time was there to ponder. Swinging from hold to hold across the\r\ndizzy precipice, as an ape swingeth from bough to bough, the beast drew\r\nnear. The shape of it was as a lion, but bigger and taller, the colour\r\na dull red, and it had prickles lancing out behind, as of a porcupine;\r\nits face a man’s face, if aught so hideous might be conceived of\r\nhuman kind, with staring eyeballs, low wrinkled brow, elephant ears,\r\nsome wispy mangy likeness of a lion’s mane, huge bony chaps, brown\r\nblood-stained gubber-tushes grinning betwixt bristly lips. Straight for\r\nthe ledge it made, and as they braced them to receive it, with a great\r\nswing heaved a man’s height above them and leaped down upon their ledge\r\nfrom aloft betwixt Juss and Brandoch Daha ere they were well aware of\r\nits changed course. Brandoch Daha smote at it a great swashing blow and\r\ncut off its scorpion tail; but it clawed Juss’s shoulder, smote down\r\nMivarsh, and charged like a lion upon Brandoch Daha, who, missing his\r\nfooting on the narrow edge of rock, fell backwards a great fall, clear\r\nof the cliff, down to the snow an hundred feet beneath them.\r\n\r\nAs it craned over, minded to follow and make an end of him, Juss smote\r\nit in the hinder parts and on the ham, shearing away the flesh from\r\nthe thigh bone, and his sword came with a clank against the brazen\r\nclaws of its foot. So with a horrid bellow it turned on Juss, rearing\r\nlike a horse; and it was three heads greater than a tall man in stature\r\nwhen it reared aloft, and the breadth of its chest like the chest of\r\na bear. The stench of its breath choked Juss’s mouth and his senses\r\nsickened, but he slashed it athwart the belly, a great round-armed\r\nblow, cutting open its belly so that the guts fell out. Again he\r\nhewed at it, but missed, and his sword came against the rock, and was\r\nshivered into pieces. So when that noisome vermin fell forward on\r\nhim roaring like a thousand lions, Juss grappled with it, running in\r\nbeneath its body and clasping it and thrusting his arms into its inward\r\nparts, to rip out its vitals if so he might. So close he grappled it\r\nthat it might not reach him with its murthering teeth, but its claws\r\nsliced off the flesh from his left knee downward to the ankle bone,\r\nand it fell on him and crushed him on the rock, breaking in the bones\r\nof his breast. And Juss, for all his bitter pain and torment, and for\r\nall he was well nigh stifled by the sore stink of the creature’s breath\r\nand the stink of its blood and puddings blubbering about his face and\r\nbreast, yet by his great strength wrastled with that fell and filthy\r\nman-eater. And ever he thrust his right hand, armed with the hilt and\r\nstump of his broken sword, yet deeper into its belly until he searched\r\nout its heart and did his will upon it, slicing the heart asunder like\r\na lemon and severing and tearing all the great vessels about the heart\r\nuntil the blood gushed about him like a spring. And like a caterpillar\r\nthe beast curled up and straightened out in its death spasms, and it\r\nrolled and fell from that ledge, a great fall, and lay by Brandoch\r\nDaha, the foulest beside the fairest of all earthly beings, reddening\r\nthe pure snow with its blood. And the spines that grew on the hinder\r\nparts of the beast went out and in like the sting of a new-dead wasp\r\nthat goes out and in continually. It fell not clean to the snow, as by\r\nthe care of heaven was fallen Brandoch Daha, but smote an edge of rock\r\nnear the bottom, and that strook out its brains. There it lay in its\r\nblood, gaping to the sky.\r\n\r\nNow was Juss stretched face downward as one dead, on that giddy edge of\r\nrock. Mivarsh had saved him, seizing him by the foot and drawing him\r\nback to safety when the beast fell. A sight of terror he was, clotted\r\nfrom head to toe with the beast’s blood and his own. Mivarsh bound his\r\nwounds and laid him tenderly as he might back against the cliff, then\r\npeered down a long while to know if the beast were dead indeed.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gazed downward earnestly so long that his eyes watered\r\nwith the strain, and still the beast stirred not, Mivarsh prostrated\r\nhimself and made supplication saying aloud, “O Shlimphli, Shlamphi,\r\nand Shebamri, gods of my father and my father’s fathers, have pity of\r\nyour child, if as I dearly trow your power extendeth over this far and\r\nforbidden country no less than over Impland, where your child hath\r\never worshipped you in your holy places, and taught my sons and my\r\ndaughters to revere your holy names, and made an altar in mine house,\r\npointed by the stars in manner ordained from of old, and offered up my\r\nseventh-born son and was minded to offer up my seventh-born daughter\r\nthereon, in meekness and righteousness according to your holy will; but\r\nthis I might not do, since you vouchsafed me not a seventh daughter,\r\nbut six only. Wherefore I beseech you, of your holy names’ sake,\r\nstrengthen my hand to let down this my companion safely by the rope,\r\nand thereafter bring me safely down from this rock, howsoever he be a\r\ndevil and an unbeliever; O save his life, save both their lives. For\r\nI am sure that if these be not saved alive, never shall your child\r\nreturn, but in this far land starve and die like an insect that dureth\r\nbut for a day.”\r\n\r\nSo prayed Mivarsh. And belike the high Gods were moved to pity of his\r\ninnocence, hearing him so cry for help unto his mumbo-jumbos, where no\r\nhelp was; and belike they were not minded that those lords of Demonland\r\nshould there die evilly before their time, unhonoured, unsung.\r\nHowsoever, Mivarsh arose and made fast the rope about Lord Juss,\r\nknotting it cunningly beneath the arms that it might not tighten in the\r\nlowering and crush his breast and ribs, and so with much ado lowered\r\nhim down to the foot of the cliff. Thereafter came Mivarsh himself down\r\nthat perilous wall, and albeit for many a time he thought his bane was\r\nupon him, yet by good cragsmanship spurred by cold necessity he gat him\r\ndown at last. Being down, he delayed not to minister to his companions,\r\nwho came to themselves with heavy groaning. But when Lord Juss was come\r\nto himself he did his healing art both on himself and on Lord Brandoch\r\nDaha, so that in a while they were able to stand upon their feet,\r\nalbeit something stiff and weary and like to vomit. And it was by then\r\nthe third hour past noon.\r\n\r\nWhile they rested, beholding where the beast mantichora lay in his\r\nblood, Juss spake and said, “It is to be said of thee, O Brandoch Daha,\r\nthat thou to-day hast done both the worst and the best. The worst,\r\nwhen thou wast so stubborn set to fare upon this climb which hath come\r\nwithin a little of spilling both thee and me. The best, whenas thou\r\ndidst smite off his tail. Was that by policy or by chance?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said he, “I was never so poor a man of my hands that I need turn\r\nbraggart. ’Twas handiest to my sword, and it disliked me to see it\r\nwagging. Did aught lie on it?”\r\n\r\n“The sting of his tail,” answered Juss, “were competent for thine or my\r\ndestruction, and it grazed but our little finger.”\r\n\r\n“Thou speakest like a book,” said Brandoch Daha. “Else might I scarce\r\nknow thee for my noble friend, being berayed with blood as a buffalo\r\nwith mire. Be not angry with me, if I am most at ease to windward of\r\nthee.”\r\n\r\nJuss laughed. “If thou be not too nice,” he said, “go to the beast\r\nand dabble thyself too with the blood of his bowels. Nay, I mock not;\r\nit is most needful. These be enemies not of mankind only, but each of\r\nother: walking every one by himself, loathing every one his kind living\r\nor dead, so that in all the world there abideth nought loathlier unto\r\nthem than the blood of their own kind, the least smell whereof they do\r\nabhor as a mad dog abhorreth water. And ’tis a clinging smell. So are\r\nwe after this encounter most sure against them.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThat night they camped at the foot of a spur of Avsek, and set forth at\r\ndawn down the long valley eastward. All day they heard the roaring of\r\nmantichores from the desolate flanks of Ela Mantissera that showed now\r\nno longer as a pyramid but as a long-backed screen, making the southern\r\nrampart of that valley. It was ill going, and they somewhat shaken. Day\r\nwas nigh gone when beyond the eastern slopes of Ela they came where the\r\nwhite waters of the river they followed thundered together with a black\r\nwater rushing down from the south-west. Below, the river ran east in a\r\nwide valley dropping afar to tree-clad depths. In the fork above the\r\nwatersmeet the rocks enclosed a high green knoll, like some fragment of\r\na kindlier clime that over-lived into an age of ruin.\r\n\r\n“Here, too,” said Juss, “my dream walked with me. And if it be ill\r\ncrossing there where this stream breaketh into a dozen branching\r\ncataracts a little above the watersmeet, yet well I think ’tis our only\r\ncrossing.” So, ere the light should fade, they crossed that perilous\r\nedge above the water-falls, and slept on the green knoll.\r\n\r\nThat knoll Juss named Throstlegarth, after a thrush that waked them\r\nnext morning, singing in a little wind-stunted mountain thorn that\r\ngrew among the rocks. Strangely sounded that homely song on the cold\r\nmountain side, under the unhallowed heights of Ela, close to the\r\nconfines of those enchanted snows which guard Koshtra Belorn.\r\n\r\nNo sight of the high mountains had they from Throstlegarth, nor, for\r\na long while, from the bed of that straight steep glen of the black\r\nwaters up which now their journey lay. Rugged spurs and buttresses shut\r\nthem in. High on the left bank above the cataracts they made their way,\r\nbuffeted by the wind that leaped and charged among the crags, their\r\nears sated with the roaring sound of waters, their eyes filled with the\r\nspray blown upward. And Mivarsh followed after them. Silent they fared,\r\nfor the way was steep and in such a wind and such a noise of torrents\r\na man must shout lustily if he would be heard. Very desolate was that\r\nvalley, having a dark aspect and a ghastful, such as a man might look\r\nfor in the infernal glens of Pyriphlegethon or Acheron. No living thing\r\nthey saw, save at whiles high above them an eagle sailing down the\r\nwind, and once a beast’s form running in the hollow mountain side. This\r\nstood at gaze, lifting up its foul human platter-face with glittering\r\neyes bloody and great as saucers; scented its fellow’s blood, started,\r\nand fled among the crags.\r\n\r\nSo fared they for the space of three hours, and so, coming suddenly\r\nround a shoulder of the hill, stood on the upper threshold of that\r\nglen at the gates of a flat upland valley. Here they beheld a sight\r\nto darken all earth’s glories and strike dumb all her singers with\r\nits grandeur. Framed in the crags of the hillsides, canopied by blue\r\nheaven, Koshtra Pivrarcha stood before them. So huge he was that even\r\nhere at six miles’ distance the eye might not at a glance behold him,\r\nbut must sweep back and forth as over a broad landscape from the\r\nponderous roots of the mountain where they sprang black and sheer from\r\nthe glacier, up the vast face, where buttress was piled upon buttress\r\nand tower upon tower in a blinding radiance of ice-hung precipice and\r\nsnow-filled gully, to the lone heights where like spears menacing high\r\nheaven the white teeth of the summit-ridge cleft the sky. From right to\r\nleft he filled nigh a quarter of the heavens, from the graceful peak\r\nof Ailinon looking over his western shoulder, to where on the east the\r\nsnowy slopes of Jalchi shut in the prospect, hiding Koshtra Belorn.\r\n\r\nThey camped that evening on the left moraine of the High Glacier of\r\nTemarm. Long spidery streamers of cloud, filmy as the gauze of a lady’s\r\nveil, blew eastward from the spires on the ridge, signs of wild weather\r\naloft.\r\n\r\nJuss said, “Glassy clear is the air. That forerunneth not fair weather.”\r\n\r\n“Well, time shall wait for us if need be,” said Brandoch Daha. “So\r\nmightily my desire crieth unto me from those horns of ice that, having\r\nonce looked on them, I had as lief die as leave them unclimbed. But of\r\nthee, O Juss, I make some marvel. Thou wast bidden inquire in Koshtra\r\nBelorn, and sure she were easier won than Koshtra Pivrarcha, going\r\nbehind Jalchi by the snowfields and so avoiding her great western\r\ncliffs.”\r\n\r\n“There is a saw in Impland,” answered Juss, “‘Ware of a tall wife.’\r\nEven so there lieth a curse on any that shall attempt Koshtra Belorn\r\nthat hath not first looked down upon her; and he shall have his death\r\nor ever he have his will. And from one point only of earth may a man\r\nlook down on Koshtra Belorn; and ’tis from yonder unascended tooth\r\nof ice where thou seest the last beam burn. For that is the topmost\r\npinnacle of Koshtra Pivrarcha. And it is the highest point of the\r\nstablished earth.”\r\n\r\nThey were silent a minute’s space. Then Juss spake: “Thou wast ever\r\ngreatest amongst us as a mountaineer. Which way likes thee best for our\r\nclimbing up him?”\r\n\r\n“O Juss,” said Brandoch Daha, “on ice and snow thou art my master.\r\nTherefore give me thy rede. For mine own choice and pleasure, I have\r\nsettled it this hour and more: namely to ascend into the gap between\r\nthe two mountains, and thence turn westward up the east ridge of\r\nPivrarcha.”\r\n\r\n“It is the fearsomest climb to look on,” said Juss, “and belike the\r\ngrandest, and for both counts I had wagered it thy choice. That gap\r\nhight the Gates of Zimiamvia. It, and the Koshtra glacier that runneth\r\nup to it, lieth under the weird I told thee of. It were our death to\r\nadventure there ere we had looked down upon Koshtra Belorn; which done,\r\nthe charm is broke for us, and from that time forth it needeth but\r\nour own might and skill and a high heart to accomplish whatsoever we\r\ndesire.”\r\n\r\n“Why then, the great north buttress,” cried Brandoch Daha. “So shall\r\nshe not behold us as we climb, until we come forth on the highest tooth\r\nand overlook her and tame her to our will.”\r\n\r\nSo they supped and slept. But the wind cried among the crags all night\r\nlong, and in the morning snow and sleet blotted out the mountains. All\r\nday the storm held, and in a lull they struck camp and came down again\r\nto Throstlegarth, and there abode nine days and nine nights in wind and\r\nrain and battering hail.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth day the weather abated, and they went up and crossed the\r\nglacier and lodged them in a cave in the rock at the foot of the great\r\nnorth buttress of Koshtra Pivrarcha. At dawn Juss and Brandoch Daha\r\nwent forth to survey the prospect. They crossed the mouth of the steep\r\nsnow-choked valley that ran up to the main ridge betwixt Ashnilan\r\non the west and Koshtra Pivrarcha on the east, rounded the base of\r\nAilinon, and climbed from the west to a snow saddle some three thousand\r\nfeet up the ridge of that mountain, whence they might view the buttress\r\nand choose their way for their attempt.\r\n\r\n“’Tis a two days’ journey to the top,” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “If\r\nnight on the ridge freeze us not to death, I dread no other hindrance.\r\nThat black rib that riseth half a mile above our camp, shall take us\r\nclean up to the crest of the buttress, striking it above the great\r\ntower at the northern end. If the rocks be like those we camped on,\r\nhard as diamond and rough as a sponge, they shall not fail us but by\r\nour own neglect. As I live, I ne’er saw their like for climbing.”\r\n\r\n“So far, well,” said Juss.\r\n\r\n“Above,” said Brandoch Daha, “I’d drive thee a chariot until we come\r\nto the first great kick o’ the ridge. That must we round, or ne’er\r\ngo further, and on this side it showeth ill enough, for the rocks\r\nshelve outward. If they be iced, there’s work indeed. Beyond that, I’ll\r\nprophesy nought, O Juss, for I can see nought clear save that the ridge\r\nis hacked into clefts and steeples. How we may overcome them must be\r\nput to the proof. It is too high and too far to know. This only: where\r\nwe would go, there have we gone until now. And by that ridge lieth, if\r\nany way there lieth, the way to this mountain top that we crossed the\r\nworld to climb.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNext day with the first paling of the skies they arose all three and\r\nset forth southward over the crisp snows. They roped at the foot of the\r\nglacier that came down from the saddle, some five thousand feet above\r\nthem, where the main ridge dips between Ashnilan and Koshtra Pivrarcha.\r\nEre the brighter stars were swallowed in the light of morning they\r\nwere cutting their way among the labyrinthine towers and chasms of the\r\nice-fall. Soon the new daylight flooded the snowfields of the High\r\nGlacier of Temarm, dyeing them green and saffron and palest rose. The\r\nsnows of Islargyn glowed far away in the north to the right of the\r\nwhite dome of Emshir. Ela Mantissera blocked the view north-eastward.\r\nThe buttress that bounded their valley on the east plunged it in shadow\r\nblue as a summer sea. High on the other side the great twin peaks of\r\nAilinon and Ashnilan, roused by the warm beams out of their frozen\r\nsilence of the night, growled at whiles with avalanches and falling\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nJuss was their leader in the ice-fall, guiding them now along high\r\nknife-edges that fell away on either hand to unsounded depths,\r\nnow within the very lips of those chasms, along the bases of the\r\nice-towers. These, five times a man’s height, some square, some\r\npinnacled, some shattered or piled with the ruins of their kind, leaned\r\nabove the path, as ready to fall and overwhelm the climbers and dash\r\ntheir bones for ever down to those blue-green secret places of frost\r\nand silence where the chips of ice chinked hollow as Juss pressed\r\nonward, cutting his steps with Mivarsh’s axe. At length the slope eased\r\nand they walked out on the unbroken surface of the glacier, and passing\r\nby a snow-bridge over the great rift betwixt the glacier and the\r\nmountain side came two hours before noon to the foot of the rock-rib\r\nthat they had scanned from Ailinon.\r\n\r\nNow was Brandoch Daha to lead them. They climbed face to the rock,\r\nslowly and without rest, for sound and firm as the rocks were the holds\r\nwere small and few and the cliffs steep. Here and there a chimney gave\r\nthem passage upward, but the climb was mainly by cracks and open faces\r\nof rock, a trial of main strength and endurance such as few might\r\nsustain for a short while only: but this wall was three thousand feet\r\nin height. By noon they gained the crest, and there rested on the rocks\r\ntoo weary to speak, looking across the avalanche-swept face of Koshtra\r\nPivrarcha to the corniced parapet that ended against the western\r\nprecipices of Koshtra Belorn.\r\n\r\nFor some way the ridge of the buttress was broad and level. Then it\r\nnarrowed suddenly to the width of a horse’s back, and sprang skyward\r\ntwo thousand feet and more. Brandoch Daha went forward and climbed a\r\nfew feet up the cliff. It bulged out above him, smooth and holdless. He\r\ntried it once and again, then came down saying, “Nought without wings.”\r\n\r\nThen he went to the left. Here hanging glaciers overlooked the face\r\nfrom on high, and while he gazed an avalanche of ice-blocks roared down\r\nit. Then he went to the right, and here the rocks sloped outward, and\r\nthe sloping ledges were piled with rubbish and the rocks rotten and\r\nslippery with snow and ice. So having gone a little way he returned,\r\nand, “O Juss,” he said, “wilt take it right forth, and that must be\r\nby flying, for hold there is none: or wilt go east and dodge the\r\navalanche: or west, where all is rotten and slither and a slip were our\r\ndestruction?”\r\n\r\nSo they debated, and at length decided on the eastern road. It was an\r\nill step round the jutting corner of the tower, for little hold there\r\nwas, and the rocks were undercut below, so that a stone or a man loosed\r\nfrom that place must fall clear at a bound three or four thousand feet\r\nto the Koshtra glacier and there be dashed in pieces. Beyond, wide\r\nledges gave them passage along the wall of the tower, that now swept\r\ninward, facing south. Far overhead, dazzling white in the sunshine,\r\nthe broken glacier-edges and splinters jutted against the blue, and\r\nicicles greater than a man hung glittering from every ledge: a sight\r\nheavenly fair, whereof they yet had little joy, hastening as they had\r\nnot hastened in their lives before to be out of the danger of that\r\nice-swept face.\r\n\r\nSuddenly was a noise above them like the crack of a giant whip, and\r\nlooking up they beheld against the sky a dark mass which opened like\r\na flower and spread into a hundred fragments. The Demons and Mivarsh\r\nhugged the cliffs where they stood, but there was little cover. All\r\nthe air was filled with the shrieking of the stones, as they swept\r\ndownwards like fiends returning to the pit, and with the crash of them\r\nas they dashed against the cliffs and burst in pieces. The echoes\r\nrolled and reverberated from cliff to distant cliff, and the limbs of\r\nthe mountain seemed to writhe as under a scourge. When it was done,\r\nMivarsh was groaning for pain of his left wrist sore hurt with a stone.\r\nThe others were scatheless.\r\n\r\nJuss said to Brandoch Daha, “Back, howsoever it dislike thee.”\r\n\r\nBack they went; and an avalanche of ice crashed down the face which\r\nmust have destroyed them had they proceeded. “Thou dost misjudge me,”\r\nsaid Brandoch Daha, laughing. “Give me where my life lieth on mine own\r\nmight and main; then is danger meat and drink to me, and nought shall\r\nturn me back. But here on this cursed cliff, on the ledges whereof a\r\ncripple might walk at ease, we be the toys of chance. And it were pure\r\nfolly to abide upon it a moment longer.”\r\n\r\n“Two ways be left us,” said Juss. “To turn back, and that were our\r\nshame for ever; and to essay the western traverse.”\r\n\r\n“And that should be the bane of any save of me and thee,” said Brandoch\r\nDaha. “And if our bane, why, we shall sleep sound.”\r\n\r\n“Mivarsh,” said Juss, “is nought so bounden to this adventure. He hath\r\nbravely held by us, and bravely stood our friend. Yet here we be come\r\nto such a pass, I sore misdoubt me if it were less danger of his life\r\nto come with us than seek safety alone.”\r\n\r\nBut Mivarsh put on a hardy face. Never a word he spake, but nodded his\r\nhead, as who should say, “Forward.”\r\n\r\n“First I must be thy leech,” said Juss. And he bound up Mivarsh’s\r\nwrist. And because the day was now far spent, they camped under the\r\ngreat tower, hoping next day to reach the top of Koshtra Pivrarcha that\r\nstood unseen some six thousand feet above them.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNext morning, when it was light enough to climb, they set forth. For\r\ntwo hours’ space on that traverse not a moment passed but they were\r\nin instant peril of death. They were not roped, for on those slabbery\r\nrocks one man had dragged a dozen to perdition had he made a slip. The\r\nledges sloped outward; they were piled with broken rock and mud; the\r\nsoft red rock broke away at a hand’s touch and plunged at a leap to the\r\nglacier below. Down and up and along, and down and up and up again they\r\nwound their way, rounding the base of that great tower, and came at\r\nlast by a rotten gully safe to the ridge above it.\r\n\r\nWhile they climbed, white wispy clouds which had gathered in the high\r\ngullies of Ailinon in the morning had grown to a mass of blackness that\r\nhid all the mountains to the west. Great streamers ran from it across\r\nthe gulf below, joined and boiled upward, lifting and sinking like a\r\nfull-tided sea, rising at last to the high ridge where the Demons stood\r\nand wrapping them in a cloak of vapour with a chill wind in its folds,\r\nand darkness in broad noon-day. They halted, for they might not see\r\nthe rocks before them. The wind grew boisterous, shouting among the\r\nsplintered towers. Snow swept powdery and keen across the ridge. The\r\ncloud lifted and plunged again like some great bird shadowing them with\r\nits wings. From its bosom the lightning flared above and below. Thunder\r\ncrashed on the heels of the lightning, sending the echoes rolling among\r\nthe distant cliffs. Their weapons, planted in the snow, sizzled with\r\nblue flame; Juss had counselled laying them aside lest they should\r\nperish holding them. Crouched in a hollow of the snow among the rocks\r\nof that high ridge of Koshtra Pivrarcha, Lord Juss and Lord Brandoch\r\nDaha and Mivarsh Faz weathered that night of terror. When night came\r\nthey knew not, for the storm brought darkness on them hours before\r\nsun-down. Blinding snow and sleet and fire and thunder, and wild winds\r\nshrieking in the gullies till the firm mountain seemed to rock, kept\r\nthem awake. They were near frozen, and scarce desired aught but death,\r\nwhich might bring them ease from that hellish roundelay.\r\n\r\nDay broke with a weak gray light, and the storm died down. Juss stood\r\nup weary beyond speech. Mivarsh said, “Ye be devils, but of myself I\r\nmarvel. For I have dwelt by snow mountains all my days, and many I\r\nwot of that have been benighted on the snows in wild weather. And not\r\none but was starved by reason of the cold. I speak of them that were\r\nfound. Many were not found, for the spirits devoured them.”\r\n\r\nWhereat Lord Brandoch Daha laughed aloud, saying, “O Mivarsh, I fear me\r\nthat in thee I have but a graceless dog. Look on him, that in hardihood\r\nand bodily endurance against all hardships of frost or fire surpasseth\r\nme as greatly as I surpass thee. Yet is he weariest of the three.\r\nWouldst know why? I’ll tell thee: all night he hath striven against\r\nthe cold, chafing not himself only but me and thee to save us from\r\nfrost-bite. And be sure nought else had saved thy carcase.”\r\n\r\nBy then was the mist grown lighter, so that they might see the ridge\r\nfor an hundred paces or more where it went up before them, each\r\npinnacle standing out shadowy and unsubstantial against the next\r\nsucceeding one more shadowy still. And the pinnacles showed monstrous\r\nhuge through the mist, like mountain peaks in stature.\r\n\r\nThey roped and set forth, scaling the towers or turning them, now on\r\nthis side now on that; sometimes standing on teeth of rock that seemed\r\ncut off from all earth else, solitary in a sea of shifting vapour;\r\nsometimes descending into a deep gash in the ridge with a blank wall\r\nrearing aloft on the further side and empty air yawning to left and\r\nright. The rocks were firm and good, like those they had first climbed\r\nfrom the glacier. But they went but a slow pace, for the climbing was\r\ndifficult and made dangerous by new snow and by the ice that glazed the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nAs the day wore the wind was fallen, and all was still when they stood\r\nat length before a ridge of hard ice that shot steeply up before them\r\nlike the edge of a sword. The east side of it on their left was almost\r\nsheer, ending in a blank precipice that dropped out of sight without a\r\nbreak. The western slope, scarcely less steep, ran down in a white even\r\nsheet of frozen snow till the clouds engulfed it.\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha waited on the last blunt tooth of rock at the foot of the\r\nice-ridge. “The rest is thine,” he cried to Lord Juss. “I would not\r\nthat any save thou should tread him first, for he is thy mountain.”\r\n\r\n“Without thee I had never won up hither,” answered Juss; “and it is not\r\nfitting that I should have that glory to stand first upon the peak when\r\nthine was the main achievement. Go thou before.”\r\n\r\n“I will not,” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “And it is not so.”\r\n\r\nSo Juss went forward, smiting with his axe great steps just below the\r\nbackbone of the ridge on the western side, and Lord Brandoch Daha and\r\nMivarsh Faz followed in the steps.\r\n\r\nPresently a wind arose in the unseen spaces of the sky, and tore the\r\nmist like a rotten garment. Spears of sunlight blazed through the\r\nrifts. Distant sunny lands shimmered in the unimaginable depths to the\r\nsouthward, seen over the crest of a tremendous wall that stood beyond\r\nthe abyss: a screen of black rock buttresses seamed with a thousand\r\ngullies of glistening snow, and crowned as with battlements with a row\r\nof mountain peaks, savage and fierce of form, that made the eye blink\r\nfor their brightness: the lean spires of the summit-ridge of Koshtra\r\nPivrarcha. These, that the Demons had so long looked up to as in\r\ndistant heaven, now lay beneath their feet. Only the peak they climbed\r\nstill reared itself above them, clear now and near to view, showing a\r\nbare beetling cliff on the north-east, overhung by a cornice of snow.\r\nJuss marked the cornice, turned him again to his step-cutting, and in\r\nhalf an hour from the breaking of the clouds stood on that unascended\r\npinnacle, with all earth beneath him.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThey went down a few feet on the southern side and sat on some rocks.\r\nA fair lake studded with islands lay bosomed in wooded and crag-girt\r\nhills at the foot of a deep-cut valley which ran down from the Gates\r\nof Zimiamvia. Ailinon and Ashnilan rose near by in the west, with\r\nthe delicate white peak of Akra Garsh showing between them. Beyond,\r\nmountain beyond mountain like the sea.\r\n\r\nJuss looked southward where the blue land stretched in fold upon fold\r\nof rolling country, soft and misty, till it melted in the sky. “Thou\r\nand I,” said he, “first of the children of men, now behold with living\r\neyes the fabled land of Zimiamvia. Is that true, thinkest thou, which\r\nphilosophers tell us of that fortunate land: that no mortal foot may\r\ntread it, but the blessed souls do inhabit it of the dead that be\r\ndeparted, even they that were great upon earth and did great deeds\r\nwhen they were living, that scorned not earth and the delights and\r\nthe glories thereof, and yet did justly and were not dastards nor yet\r\noppressors?”\r\n\r\n“Who knoweth?” said Brandoch Daha, resting his chin in his hand and\r\ngazing south as in a dream. “Who shall say he knoweth?”\r\n\r\nThey were silent awhile. Then Juss spake saying, “If thou and I come\r\nthither at last, O my friend, shall we remember Demonland?” And when he\r\nanswered him not, Juss said, “I had rather row on Moonmere under the\r\nstars of a summer’s night, than be a King of all the land of Zimiamvia.\r\nAnd I had rather watch the sunrise on the Scarf, than dwell in gladness\r\nall my days on an island of that enchanted Lake of Ravary, under\r\nKoshtra Belorn.”\r\n\r\nNow the curtain of cloud that had hung till now about the eastern\r\nheights was rent into shreds, and Koshtra Belorn stood like a bride\r\nbefore them, two or three miles to eastward, facing the slanting rays\r\nof the sun. On all her vast precipices scarce a rock showed bare, so\r\nencrusted were they with a dazzling robe of snow. More lovely she\r\nseemed and more graceful in her airy poise than they had yet beheld\r\nher. Juss and Brandoch Daha rose up, as men arise to greet a queen in\r\nher majesty. In silence they looked on her for some minutes.\r\n\r\nThen Brandoch Daha spake, saying, “Behold thy bride, O Juss.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         XIII: KOSHTRA BELORN\r\n\r\n  HOW THE LORD JUSS ACCOMPLISHED AT LENGTH HIS DREAM’S BEHEST,\r\n      TO INQUIRE IN KOSHTRA BELORN; AND WHAT MANNER OF ANSWER HE\r\n      RECEIVED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night they spent safely, by favour of the Gods, under the highest\r\ncrags of Koshtra Pivrarcha, in a sheltered hollow piled round with\r\nsnow. Dawn came like a lily, saffron-hued, smirched with smoke-gray\r\nstreaks that slanted from the north. The great peaks stood as islands\r\nabove a main of level cloud, out of which the sun walked flaming, a\r\nball of red-gold fire. An hour before his face appeared, the Demons\r\nand Mivarsh were roped and started on their eastward journey. Ill to\r\ndo with as was the crest of the great north buttress by which they had\r\nclimbed the mountain, seven times worse was this eastern ridge, leading\r\nto Koshtra Belorn. Leaner of back it was, flanked by more profound\r\nabysses, deeplier gashed, too treacherous and too sudden in its changes\r\nfrom sure rock to rotten and perilous: piled with tottering crags,\r\nhung about with cornices of uncertain snow, girt with cliffs smooth\r\nand holdless as a castle wall. Small marvel that it cost them thirteen\r\nhours to come down that ridge. The sun wheeled towards the west when\r\nthey reached at length that frozen edge, sharp as a sickle, that was in\r\nthe Gates of Zimiamvia. Weary they were, and ropeless; for by no means\r\nelse might they come down from the last great tower save by the rope\r\nmade fast from above. A fierce north-easter had swept the ridges all\r\nday, bringing snow-storms on its wings. Their fingers were numbed with\r\ncold, and the beards of Lord Brandoch Daha and Mivarsh Faz stiff with\r\nice.\r\n\r\nToo weary to halt, they set forth again, Juss leading. It was many\r\nhundred paces along that ice-edge, and the sun was near setting when\r\nthey stood at last within a stone’s throw of the cliffs of Koshtra\r\nBelorn. Since before noon avalanches had thundered ceaselessly down\r\nthose cliffs. Now, in the cool of the evening, all was still. The wind\r\nwas fallen. The deep blue sky was without a cloud. The fires of sunset\r\ncrept down the vast white precipices before them till every ledge and\r\nfold and frozen pinnacle glowed pink colour, and every shadow became\r\nan emerald. The shadow of Koshtra Pivrarcha lay cold across the lower\r\nstretches of the face on the Zimiamvian side. The edge of that shadow\r\nwas as the division betwixt the living and the dead.\r\n\r\n“What dost think on?” said Juss to Brandoch Daha, that leaned upon his\r\nsword surveying that glory.\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha started and looked on him. “Why,” said he, “on this: that\r\nit is likely thy dream was but a lure, sent thee by the King to tempt\r\nus on to mighty actions reserved for our destruction. On this side at\r\nleast ’tis very certain there lieth no way up Koshtra Belorn.”\r\n\r\n“What of the little martlet,” said Juss, “who, whiles we were yet\r\na great way off, flew out of the south to greet us with a gracious\r\nmessage?”\r\n\r\n“Well if it were not a devil of his,” said Brandoch Daha.\r\n\r\n“I will not turn back,” said Juss. “Thou needest not to come with me.”\r\nAnd he turned again to look on those frozen cliffs.\r\n\r\n“No?” said Brandoch Daha. “Nor thou with me. Thou’lt make me angry if\r\nthou wilt so vilely wrest my words. Only fare not too securely; and let\r\nthat axe still be ready in thine hand, as is my sword, for kindlier\r\nwork than step-cutting. And if thou embrace the hope to climb her by\r\nthis wall before us, then hath the King’s enchantery made thee fey.”\r\n\r\nBy then was the sun gone down. Under the wings of night uplifted from\r\nthe east, the unfathomable heights of air turned a richer blue; and\r\nhere and there, most dim and hard to see, throbbed a tiny point of\r\nlight: the greater stars opening their eyelids to the gathering dark.\r\nGloom crept upward, brimming the valleys far below like a rising tide\r\nof the sea. Frost and stillness waited on the eternal night to resume\r\nher reign. The solemn cliffs of Koshtra Belorn stood in tremendous\r\nsilence, death-pale against the sky.\r\n\r\nJuss came backward a step along the ridge, and laying his hand on\r\nBrandoch Daha’s, “Be still,” he said, “and behold this marvel.” A\r\nlittle up the face of the mountain on the Zimiamvian side, it was as if\r\nsome leavings of the after-glow had been entangled among the crags and\r\nfrozen curtains of snow. As the gloom deepened, that glow brightened\r\nand spread, filling a rift that seemed to go into the mountain.\r\n\r\n“It is because of us,” said Juss, in a low voice. “She is afire with\r\nexpectation of us.”\r\n\r\nNo sound was there save of their breath coming and going, and of the\r\nstrokes of Juss’s axe, and of the chips of ice chinking downwards\r\ninto silence as he cut their way along the ridge. And ever brighter,\r\nas night fell, burned that strange sunset light above them. Perilous\r\nclimbing it was for fifty feet or more from the ridge, for they had no\r\nrope, the way was hard to see, and the rocks were steep and iced and\r\nevery ledge deep in snow. Yet came they safe at length up by a steep\r\nshort gully to the gully’s head where it widened to that rift of the\r\nwondrous light. Here might two walk abreast, and Lord Juss and Lord\r\nBrandoch Daha took their weapons and entered abreast into the rift.\r\nMivarsh was fain to call to them, but he was speechless. He came after,\r\nclose at their heels like a dog.\r\n\r\nFor some way the bed of the cave ran upwards, then dipped at a gentle\r\nslope deep into the mountain. The air was cold, yet warm after the\r\nfrozen air without. The rose-red light shone warm on the walls and\r\nfloor of that passage, but none might say whence it shone. Strange\r\nsculptures glimmered overhead, bull-headed men, stags with human faces,\r\nmammoths, and behemoths of the flood: vast forms and uncertain carved\r\nin the living rock. For hours Juss and his companions pursued their\r\nway, winding downward, losing all sense of north and south. Little by\r\nlittle the light faded, and after an hour or two they went in darkness:\r\nyet not in utter darkness, but as of a starless night in summer where\r\nall night long twilight lingers. They went a soft pace, for fear of\r\npitfalls in the way.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Juss halted and sniffed the air. “I smell new-mown hay,”\r\nhe said, “and flower-scents. Is this my fantasy, or canst thou smell\r\nthem too?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, and have smelt it this half-hour past,” answered Brandoch Daha;\r\n“also the passage wideneth before us, and the roof of it goeth higher\r\nas we journey.”\r\n\r\n“This,” said Juss, “is a great wonder.”\r\n\r\nThey fared onward, and in a while the slope slackened, and they felt\r\nloose stones and grit beneath their feet, and in a while soft earth.\r\nThey bent down and touched the earth, and there was grass growing, and\r\nnight-dew on the grass, and daisies folded up asleep. A brook tinkled\r\non the right. So they crossed that meadow in the dark, until they stood\r\nbelow a shadowy mass that bulked big above them. In a blind wall so\r\nhigh the top was swallowed up in the darkness a gate stood open. They\r\ncrossed that threshold and passed through a paved court that clanked\r\nunder their tread. Before them a flight of steps went up to folding\r\ndoors under an archway.\r\n\r\nLord Brandoch Daha felt Mivarsh pluck him by the sleeve. The little\r\nman’s teeth were chattering together in his head for terror. Brandoch\r\nDaha smiled and put an arm about him. Juss had his foot on the lowest\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nIn that instant came a sound of music playing, but of what instruments\r\nthey might not guess. Great thundering chords began it, like trumpets\r\ncalling to battle, first high, then low, then shuddering down to\r\nsilence; then that great call again, sounding defiance. Then the keys\r\ntook new voices, groping in darkness, rising to passionate lament,\r\nhovering and dying away on the wind, until nought remained but a roll\r\nas of muffled thunder, long, low, quiet, but menacing ill. And now out\r\nof the darkness of that induction burst a mighty form, three ponderous\r\nblows, as of breakers that plunge and strike on a desolate shore; a\r\npause; those blows again; a grinding pause; a rushing of wings, as of\r\nFuries steaming up from the pit; another flight of them dreadful in its\r\ndeliberation; then a wild rush upward and a swooping again; confusion\r\nof hell, raging serpents blazing through night sky. Then on a sudden\r\nout of a distant key, a sweet melody, long-drawn and clear, like a\r\nblaze of low sunshine piercing the dust-clouds above a battle-field.\r\nThis was but an interlude to the terror of the great main theme that\r\ncame in tumultuous strides up again from the deeps, storming to a grand\r\nclimacteric of fury and passing away into silence. Now came a majestic\r\nfigure, stately and calm, born of that terror, leading to it again:\r\nbattlings of these themes in many keys, and at last the great triple\r\nblow, thundering in new strength, crushing all joy and sweetness as\r\nwith a mace of iron, battering the roots of life into a general ruin.\r\nBut even in the main stride of its outrage and terror, that great power\r\nseemed to shrivel. The thunder-blasts crashed weaklier, the harsh blows\r\nrattled awry, and the vast frame of conquest and destroying violence\r\nsank down panting, tottered and rumbled ingloriously into silence.\r\n\r\nLike men held in a trance those lords of Demonland listened to the\r\nlast echoes of the great sad chord where that music had breathed out\r\nits heart, as if the very heart of wrath were broken. But this was not\r\nthe end. Cold and serene as some chaste virgin vowed to the Gods, with\r\nclear eyes which see nought below high heaven, a quiet melody rose from\r\nthat grave of terror. Weak it seemed at first, a little thing after\r\nthat cataclysm; a little thing, like spring’s first bud peeping after\r\nthe blasting reign of cold and ice. Yet it walked undismayed, gathering\r\nas it went beauty and power. And on a sudden the folding doors swung\r\nopen, shedding a flood of radiance down the stairs.\r\n\r\nLord Juss and Lord Brandoch Daha watched, as men watch for a star to\r\nrise, that radiant portal. And like a star indeed, or like the tranquil\r\nmoon appearing, they beheld after a while one crowned like a Queen with\r\na diadem of little clouds that seemed stolen from the mountain sunset,\r\nscattering soft beams of rosy brightness. She stood alone under that\r\nmighty portico with its vast shadowy forms of winged lions in shining\r\nstone black as jet. Youthful she seemed, as one that hath but just\r\nbidden adieu to childhood, with grave sweet lips and grave black eyes\r\nand hair like the night. Little black martlets perched on her either\r\nshoulder, and a dozen more skimmed the air above her head, so swift of\r\nwing that scarcely the eye might follow them. Meantime, that delicate\r\nand simple melody mounted from height to height, until in a while it\r\nburned with all the fires of summer, burned as summer to the uttermost\r\nember, fierce and compulsive in its riot of love and beauty. So that,\r\nbefore the last triumphant chords died down in silence, that music had\r\nbrought back to Juss all the glories of the mountains, the sunset fires\r\non Koshtra Belorn, the first great revelation of the peaks from Morna\r\nMoruna; and over all these, as the spirit of that music to the eye made\r\nmanifest, the image of that Queen so blessed-fair in her youth and\r\nher clear brow’s sweet solemn respect and promise: in every line and\r\npose of her fair form, virginal dainty as a flower, and kindled from\r\nwithinward as never flower was with that divinity before the face of\r\nwhich speech and song fall silent and men may but catch their breath\r\nand worship.\r\n\r\nWhen she spoke, it was with a voice like crystal: “Thanks be and praise\r\nto the blessed Gods. For lo, the years depart, and the fated years\r\nbring forth as the Gods ordain. And ye be those that were for to come.”\r\n\r\nSurely those great lords of Demonland stood like little boys before\r\nher. She said again, “Are not ye Lord Juss and Lord Brandoch Daha of\r\nDemonland, come up to me by the way banned to all mortals else, come up\r\ninto Koshtra Belorn?”\r\n\r\nThen answered Lord Juss for them both and said, “Surely, O Queen\r\nSophonisba, we be they thou namest.”\r\n\r\nNow the Queen carried them into her palace, and into a great hall where\r\nwas her throne and state. The pillars of the hall were as vast towers,\r\nand there were galleries above them, tier upon tier, rising higher than\r\nsight could reach or the light of the gentle lamps in their stands that\r\nlighted the tables and the floor. The walls and the pillars were of a\r\nsombre stone unpolished, and on the walls strange portraitures: lions,\r\ndragons, nickers of the sea, spread-eagles, elephants, swans, unicorns,\r\nand other, lively made and richly set forth with curious colours of\r\npainting: all of giant size beyond the experience of human kind, so\r\nthat to be in that hall was as it were to shelter in a small spot of\r\nlight and life, canopied, vaulted, and embraced by the circumambient\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThe Queen sate on her throne that was bright like the face of a river\r\nruffled with wind under a silver moon. Save for those little martlets\r\nshe was unattended. She made those lords of Demonland sit down before\r\nher face, and there were brought forth by the agency of unseen hands\r\ntables before them and precious dishes filled with unknown viands. And\r\nthere played a soft music, made in the air by what unseen art they knew\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe Queen said, “Behold, ambrosia which the Gods do eat and nectar\r\nwhich they drink; on which meat and wine myself do feed, by the bounty\r\nof the blessed Gods. And the savour thereof wearieth not, and the glow\r\nthereof and the perfume thereof dieth not for ever.”\r\n\r\nSo they tasted of the ambrosia, that was white to look on and crisp to\r\nthe tooth and sweet, and being eaten revived strength in the body more\r\nthan a surfeit of bullock’s flesh, and of the nectar that was all afoam\r\nand coloured like the inmost fires of sunset. Surely somewhat of the\r\npeace of the Gods was in that nectar divine.\r\n\r\nThe Queen said, “Tell me, why are ye come?”\r\n\r\nJuss answered, “Surely there was a dream sent me, O Queen Sophonisba,\r\nthrough the gate of horn, and it bade me inquire hither after him I\r\nmost desire, for want of whom my whole soul languisheth in sorrow this\r\nyear gone by: even after my dear brother, the Lord Goldry Bluszco.”\r\n\r\nHis words ceased in his throat. For with the speaking of that name the\r\nfirm fabric of that palace quivered like the leaves of a forest under a\r\nsudden squall. Colour went from the scene, like the blood chased from\r\na man’s face by fear, and all was of a pallid hue, like the landscape\r\nwhich one beholds of a bright summer day after lying with eyes closed\r\nfor a space face-upward under the blazing sun: all gray and cold, the\r\nwarm colours burnt to ashes. Withal, followed the appearance of hateful\r\nlittle creatures issuing from the joints of the paving stones and the\r\ngreat blocks of the walls and pillars: some like grasshoppers with\r\nhuman heads and wings of flies, some like fishes with stings in their\r\ntails, some fat like toads, some like eels a-wriggling with puppy-dogs’\r\nheads and asses’ ears: loathly ones, exiles of glory, scaly and obscene.\r\n\r\nThe horror passed. Colour returned. The Queen sat like a graven statue,\r\nher lips parted. After a while she said with a shaken voice, low and\r\nwith downcast eyes, “Sirs, you demand of me a very strange matter, such\r\nas wherewith never hitherto I have been acquainted. As you are noble, I\r\nbeseech you speak not that name again. In the name of the blessed Gods,\r\nspeak it not again.”\r\n\r\nLord Juss was silent. Nought good were his thoughts within him.\r\n\r\nIn due time a little martlet by the Queen’s command brought them to\r\ntheir bed-chambers. And there in great beds soft and fragrant they went\r\nto rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN KOSHTRA BELORN.]\r\n\r\nJuss waked long in the doubtful light, troubled at heart. At length he\r\nfell into a troubled sleep. The glimmer of the lamps mingled with his\r\ndreams and his dreams with it, so that scarce he wist whether asleep\r\nor waking he beheld the walls of the bed-chamber dispart in sunder,\r\ndisclosing a prospect of vast paths of moonlight, and a solitary\r\nmountain peak standing naked out of a sea of cloud that gleamed white\r\nbeneath the moon. It seemed to him that the power of flight was upon\r\nhim, and that he flew to that mountain and hung in air beholding it\r\nnear at hand, and a circle as the appearance of fire round about it,\r\nand on the summit of the mountain the likeness of a burg or citadel\r\nof brass that was green with eld and surface-battered by the frosts\r\nand winds of ages. On the battlements was the appearance of a great\r\ncompany both men and women, never still, now walking on the wall with\r\nhands lifted up as in supplication to the crystal lamps of heaven,\r\nnow flinging themselves on their knees or leaning against the brazen\r\nbattlements to bury their faces in their hands, or standing at gaze as\r\nnight-walkers gazing into the void. Some seemed men of war, and some\r\ngreat courtiers by their costly apparel, rulers and kings and kings’\r\ndaughters, grave bearded counsellors, youths and maidens and crowned\r\nqueens. And when they went, and when they stood, and when they seemed\r\nto cry aloud bitterly, all was noiseless even as the tomb, and the\r\nfaces of those mourners pallid as a dead corpse is pallid.\r\n\r\nThen it seemed to Juss that he beheld a keep of brass flat-roofed\r\nstanding on the right, a little higher than the walls, with battlements\r\nabout the roof. He strove to cry aloud, but it was as if some devil\r\ngripped his throat stifling him, for no sound came. For in the midst\r\nof the roof, as it were on a bench of stone, was the appearance of one\r\nreclining; his chin resting in his great right hand, his elbow on an\r\narm of the bench, his cloak about him gorgeous with cloth of gold, his\r\nponderous two-handed sword beside him with its heart-shaped ruby pommel\r\ndarkly resplendent in the moonlight. Nought otherwise looked he than\r\nwhen Juss last beheld him, on their ship before the darkness swallowed\r\nthem; only the ruddy hues of life seemed departed from him, and his\r\nbrow seemed clouded with sorrow. His eye met his brother’s, but with no\r\nlook of recognition, gazing as if on some far point in the deeps beyond\r\nthe star-shine. It seemed to Juss that even so would he have looked to\r\nfind his brother Goldry as he now found him; his head unbent for all\r\nthe tyranny of those dark powers that held him in captivity: keeping\r\nlike a God his patient vigil, heedless alike of the laments of them\r\nthat shared his prison and of the menace of the houseless night about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe vision passed; and Lord Juss perceived himself in his bed again,\r\nthe cold morning light stealing between the hangings of the windows and\r\ndimming the soft radiance of the lamps.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow for seven days they dwelt in that palace. No living thing they\r\nencountered save only the Queen and her little martlets, but all\r\nthings desirous were ministered unto them by unseen hands and all\r\nroyal entertainment. Yet was Lord Juss heavy at heart, for as often\r\nas he would question the Queen of Goldry, so she would ever put him\r\nby, praying him earnestly not a second time to pronounce that name of\r\nterror. At last, walking with her alone in the cool of the evening on\r\na trodden path of a meadow where asphodel grew and other holy flowers\r\nbeside a quiet stream, he said, “So it is, O Queen Sophonisba, that\r\nwhen first I came hither and spake with thee I well thought that by\r\nthee my matter should be well sped. And didst not thou then promise me\r\nthy goodness and grace from thee thereafter?”\r\n\r\n“This is very true,” said the Queen.\r\n\r\n“Then why,” said he, “when I would question thee of that I make most\r\nstore of, wilt thou always daff me and put me by?”\r\n\r\nShe was silent, hanging her head. He looked sidelong for a minute at\r\nher sweet profile, the grave clear lines of her mouth and chin. “Of\r\nwhom must I inquire,” he said, “if not of thee, which art Queen in\r\nKoshtra Belorn and must know this thing?”\r\n\r\nShe stopped and faced him with dark eyes that were like a child’s for\r\ninnocence and like a God’s for splendour. “My lord, that I have put\r\nthee off, ascribe it not to evil intent. That were an unnatural part\r\nindeed in me unto you of Demonland who have fulfilled the weird and set\r\nme free again to visit again the world of men which I so much desire,\r\ndespite all my sorrows I there fulfilled in elder time. Or shall I\r\nforget you are at enmity with the wicked house of Witchland, and\r\ntherefore doubly pledged my friends?”\r\n\r\n“That the event must prove, O Queen,” said Lord Juss.\r\n\r\n“O saw ye Morna Moruna?” cried she. “Saw ye it in the wilderness?” And\r\nwhen he looked on her still dark and mistrustful, she said, “Is this\r\nforgot? And methought it should be mention and remembrance made thereof\r\nunto the end of the world. I pray thee, my lord, what age art thou?”\r\n\r\n“I have looked upon this world,” answered Lord Juss, “for thrice ten\r\nyears.”\r\n\r\n“And I,” said the Queen, “but seventeen summers. Yet that same age had\r\nI when thou wast born, and thy grandsire before thee, and his before\r\nhim. For the Gods gave me youth for ever more, when they brought me\r\nhither after the realm-rape that befell our house, and lodged me in\r\nthis mountain.”\r\n\r\nShe paused, and stood motionless, her hands clasped lightly before\r\nher, her head bent, her face turned a little away so that he saw only\r\nthe white curve of her neck and her cheek’s soft outline. All the air\r\nwas full of sunset, though no sun was there, but a scattered splendour\r\nonly, shed from the high roof of rock that was like a sky above them\r\nself-effulgent. Very softly she began again to speak, the crystal\r\naccents of her voice sounding like the faint notes of a bell borne from\r\na great way off on the quiet air of a summer evening. “Surely time past\r\nis gone by like a shadow since those days, when I was Queen in Morna\r\nMoruna, dwelling there with my lady mother and the princes my cousins\r\nin peace and joy. Until Gorice III. came out of the north, the great\r\nKing of Witchland, desiring to explore these mountains, for his pride\r\nsake and his insolent heart; which cost him dear. ’Twas on an evening\r\nof early summer we beheld him and his folk ride over the flowering\r\nmeadows of the Moruna. Nobly was he entertained by us, and when we\r\nknew what way he meant to go, we counselled him turn back, and the\r\nmantichores must tear him if he went. But he mocked at our advisoes,\r\nand on the morrow departed, he and his, by way of Omprenne Edge. And\r\nnever again were they seen of living man.\r\n\r\n“That had been small loss; but hereof there befell a great and horrible\r\nmischief. For in the spring of the year came Gorice IV. with a great\r\narmy out of waterish Witchland, saying with open mouth of defamation\r\nthat we were the dead King’s murtherers: we that were peaceful folk,\r\nand would not entertain an action should call us villain for all\r\nthe wealth of Impland. In the night they came, when all we save the\r\nsentinels upon the walls were in our beds secure in a quiet conscience.\r\nThey took the princes my cousins and all our men, and before our eyes\r\nmost cruelly murthered them. So that my mother seeing these things fell\r\nsuddenly into deadly swoonings and was presently dead. And the King\r\ncommanded them burn the house with fire, and he brake down the holy\r\naltars of the Gods, and defiled their high places. And unto me that was\r\nyoung and fair to look on he gave this choice, to go with him and be\r\nhis slave, other else to be cast down from the Edge and all my bones be\r\nbroken. Surely I chose this rather. But the Gods, that do help every\r\nrightful true cause, made light my fall, and guided me hither safe\r\nthrough all perils of height and cold and ravening beasts, granting me\r\nyouth and peaceful days for ever, here on the borderland between the\r\nliving and the dead.\r\n\r\n“And the Gods blew upon all the land of the Moruna in the fire of their\r\nwrath, to make it desolate, and man and beast cut off therefrom, for\r\na witness of the wicked deeds of Gorice the King, even as Gorice the\r\nKing made desolate our little castle and our pleasant places. The face\r\nof the land was lifted up to high airs where frosts do dwell, so that\r\nthe cliffs of Omprenne Edge down which ye came are ten times the height\r\nthey were when Gorice III. came down them. So was an end of flowers on\r\nthe Moruna, and an end there of spring and of summer days for ever.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen ceased speaking, and Lord Juss was silent for a space,\r\ngreatly marvelling.\r\n\r\n“Judge now,” said she, “if your foes be not my foes. It is not hidden\r\nfrom me, my lord, that you deem me but a lukewarm friend and no helper\r\nat all in your enterprise. Yet have I ceased not since ye were here to\r\nsearch and to inquire, and sent my little martlets west and east and\r\nsouth and north after tidings of him thou namedst. They are swift, even\r\nas wingy thoughts circling the stablished world; and they returned to\r\nme on weary wings, yet with never a word of thy great kinsman.”\r\n\r\nJuss looked at her eyes that were moist with tears. Truth sat in them\r\nlike an angel. “O Queen,” he cried, “why need thy little minions scour\r\nthe world, when my brother is here in Koshtra Belorn?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, saying, “This I will swear to thee, there hath no\r\nmortal come up into Koshtra Belorn save only thee and thy companions\r\nthese two hundred years.”\r\n\r\nBut Juss said again, “My brother is here in Koshtra Belorn. Mine eyes\r\nbeheld him that first night, hedged about with fires. And he is held\r\ncaptive on a tower of brass on a peak of a mountain.”\r\n\r\n“There be no mountains here,” said she, “save this in whose womb we\r\nhave our dwelling.”\r\n\r\n“Yet so I beheld my brother,” said Juss, “under the white beams of the\r\nfull moon.”\r\n\r\n“There is no moon here,” said the Queen.\r\n\r\nSo Lord Juss rehearsed to her his vision of the night, telling her\r\npoint to point of everything. She harkened gravely, and when he had\r\ndone, trembled a little and said, “This is a mystery, my lord, beyond\r\nmy resolution.”\r\n\r\nShe fell silent awhile. Then she began to say in a hushed voice, as\r\nif the very words and breath might breed some dreadful matter: “Taken\r\nup in a sending maleficial by King Gorice XII. So it hath ever been,\r\nthat whensoever there dieth one of the house of Gorice there riseth\r\nup another in his stead, and so from strength to strength. And death\r\nweakeneth not this house of Witchland, but like the dandelion weed\r\nbeing cut down and bruised it springeth up the stronger. Dost thou know\r\nwhy?”\r\n\r\nHe answered, “No.”\r\n\r\n“The blessed Gods,” said she, speaking yet lower, “have shown me many\r\nhidden matters which the sons of men know not neither imagine. Behold\r\nthis mystery. There is but One Gorice. And by the favour of heaven\r\n(that moveth sometimes in a manner our weak judgement seeketh in vain\r\nto justify) this cruel and evil One, every time whether by the sword or\r\nin the fulness of his years he cometh to die, departeth the living soul\r\nand spirit of him into a new and sound body, and liveth yet another\r\nlifetime to vex and to oppress the world, until that body die, and the\r\nnext in his turn, and so continually; having thus in a manner life\r\neternal.”\r\n\r\nJuss said, “Thy discourse, O Queen Sophonisba, is in a strain above\r\nmortality. This is a great wonder thou tellest me; whereof some\r\nlittle part I guessed aforetime, but the main I knew not. Rightfully,\r\nhaving such a timeless life, this King weareth on his thumb that worm\r\nOuroboros which doctors have from of old made for an ensample of\r\neternity, whereof the end is ever at the beginning and the beginning at\r\nthe end for ever more.”\r\n\r\n“See then the hardness of the thing,” said the Queen. “But I forget\r\nnot, my lord, that thou hast a matter nearer thine heart than this:\r\nto set free him (name him not!) concerning whom thou didst inquire of\r\nme. Touching this, know it for thy comfort, some ray of light I see.\r\nQuestion me no more till I have made trial thereof, lest it prove but a\r\nfalse dawn. If it be as I think, ’tis a trial yet abideth thee should\r\nmake the stoutest blench.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        XIV: THE LAKE OF RAVARY\r\n\r\n  OF THE FURTHERANCE GIVEN BY QUEEN SOPHONISBA, FOSTERLING OF THE\r\n      GODS, TO LORD JUSS AND LORD BRANDOCH DAHA; WITH HOW THE\r\n      HIPPOGRIFF’S EGG WAS HATCHED BESIDE THE ENCHANTED LAKE, AND\r\n      WHAT ENSUED THEREFROM.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day the Queen came to Lord Juss and Lord Brandoch Daha and made\r\nthem go with her, and Mivarsh with them to serve them, over the meadows\r\nand down a passage like that whereby they had entered the mountain, but\r\nthis led downward. “Ye may marvel,” she said, “to see daylight in the\r\nheart of this great mountain. Yet it is but the hidden work of Nature.\r\nFor the rays of the sun, striking all day upon Koshtra Belorn and upon\r\nher robe of snow, sink into the snow like water, and so soaking through\r\nthe secret places of the rocks shine again in this hollow chamber where\r\nwe dwell and in these passages cleft by the Gods to give us our goings\r\nout and our comings in. And as sunset followeth broad day with coloured\r\nfires, and moonlight or darkness followeth sunset, and dawn followeth\r\nnight ushering the bright day once more, so these changes of the dark\r\nand light succeed one another within the mountain.”\r\n\r\nThey passed on, ever downward, till after many hours they came\r\nsuddenly forth into dazzling sunlight. They stood at a cave’s mouth\r\non a beach of sand white and clean, that was lapped by the ripples of\r\na sapphire lake: a great lake, sown with islets craggy and luxuriant\r\nwith trees and flowering growths. Many-armed was the lake, winding\r\neverywhere in secret reaches behind promontories that were spurs of the\r\nmountains that held it in their bosom: some wooded or green with lush\r\nflower-spangled turf to the water’s edge, some with bare rocks abrupt\r\nfrom the water, some crowned with rugged lines of crag that sent down\r\nscree-slopes into the lake below. It was mid-afternoon, sweet-aired, a\r\nday of dappled cloud-shadows and changing lights. White birds circled\r\nabove the lake, and now and then a kingfisher flashed by like a streak\r\nof azure flame. That was a westward facing beach, at the end of a\r\nheadland that ran down clothed with pine-forests with open primrose\r\nglades from a spur of Koshtra Belorn. Northward the two great mountains\r\nstood at the head of a straight narrow valley that ran up to the Gates\r\nof Zimiamvia. Vaster they seemed than the Demons had yet beheld them,\r\nshowing at but six or seven miles’ distance a clear sixteen thousand\r\nfeet above the lake. Nor from any other point of prospect were they\r\nmore lovely to behold: Koshtra Pivrarcha like an eagle armed, shadowing\r\nwith wings, and Koshtra Belorn as a Goddess fallen a-dreaming, gracious\r\nas the morning star of heaven. Wondrous bright were their snows in the\r\nsunshine, yet ghostly and unsubstantial to view seen through the hazy\r\nsummer air. Olive trees, gray and soft-outlined like embodied mist,\r\ngrew in the lower valleys; woods of oak and birch and every forest tree\r\nclothed the slopes; and in the warmer folds of the mountain sides belts\r\nof creamy rhododendrons straggled upwards even to the moraines above\r\nthe lower glaciers and the very margin of the snows.\r\n\r\nThe Queen watched Lord Juss as his gaze moved to the left past Koshtra\r\nPivrarcha, past the blunt lower crest of Gôglio, to a great lonely\r\npeak many miles distant that frowned over the rich maze of nearer\r\nridges which stood above the lake. Its southern shoulder swept in a\r\nlong majestic line of cliffs up to a clean sharp summit; northward it\r\nfell steeplier away. Little snow hung on the sheer rock faces, save\r\nwhere the gullies cleft them. For grace and beauty scarce might Koshtra\r\nBelorn herself surpass that peak: but terrible it looked, and as a\r\nmansion of old night, that not high noon-day could wholly dispossess of\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n“There standeth a mountain great and fair,” said Lord Brandoch Daha,\r\n“which was hid in cloud when we were on the high ridges. It hath the\r\nlook of a great beast couchant.”\r\n\r\nStill the Queen watched Lord Juss, who looked still on that peak.\r\nThen he turned to her, his hands clenched on the buckles of his\r\nbreast-plates. She said, “Was it as I think?”\r\n\r\nHe took a great breath. “It was so I beheld it in the beginning,”\r\nhe said, “as from this place. But here are we too far off to see\r\nthe citadel of brass, or know if it be truly there.” And he said to\r\nBrandoch Daha, “This remaineth, that we climb that mountain.”\r\n\r\n“That can ye never do,” said the Queen.\r\n\r\n“That shall be shown,” said Brandoch Daha.\r\n\r\n“List,” said she. “Nameless is yonder mountain upon earth, for until\r\nthis hour, save only for me and you, the eye of living man hath not\r\nlooked upon it. But unto the Gods it hath a name, and unto the spirits\r\nof the blest that do inhabit this land, and unto those unhappy souls\r\nthat are held in captivity on that cold mountain top: Zora Rach nam\r\nPsarrion, standing apart above the noiseless lifeless snow-fields that\r\nfeed the Psarrion glaciers; loneliest and secretest of all earth’s\r\nmountains, and most accursed. O my lords,” she said, “Think not to\r\nclimb up Zora. Enchantments ring round Zora, so that ye should not\r\nget so near as to the edges of the snow-fields at her feet ere ruin\r\ngathered you.”\r\n\r\nJuss smiled. “O Queen Sophonisba, little thou knowest our mind, if thou\r\nthink this shall turn us back.”\r\n\r\n“I say it,” said the Queen, “with no such vain purpose; but to show you\r\nthe necessity of that way I shall now tell you of, since well I know ye\r\nwill not give over this attempt. To none save to a Demon durst I have\r\ntold it, lest heaven should hold me answerable for his death. But unto\r\nyou I may with the less danger commit this dangerous counsel if it be\r\ntrue, as I was taught long ago, that the hippogriff was seen of old in\r\nDemonland.”\r\n\r\n“The hippogriff?” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “What else is it than the\r\nemblem of our greatness? A thousand years ago they nested on Neverdale\r\nHause, and there abide unto this day in the rocks the prints of their\r\nhooves and talons. He that rode it was a forefather of mine and of Lord\r\nJuss.”\r\n\r\n“He that shall ride it again,” said Queen Sophonisba, “he only of\r\nmortal men may win to Zora Rach, and if he be man enough of his hands\r\nmay deliver him we wot of out of bondage.”\r\n\r\n“O Queen,” said Juss, “somewhat I know of grammarie and divine\r\nphilosophy, yet must I bow to thee for such learning, that dwellest\r\nhere from generation to generation and dost commune with the dead.\r\nHow shall we find this steed? Few they be, and high they fly above the\r\nworld, and come to birth but one in three hundred years.”\r\n\r\nShe answered, “I have an egg. In all lands else must such an egg lie\r\nbarren and sterile, save in this land of Zimiamvia which is sacred\r\nto the lordly races of the dead. And thus cometh this steed to the\r\nbirth: when one of might and heart beyond the wont of man sleepeth\r\nin this land with the egg in his bosom, greatly desiring some high\r\nachievement, the fire of his great longing hatcheth the egg, and the\r\nhippogriff cometh out therefrom, weak-winged at first as thou hast seen\r\na butterfly new-hatched out his chrysalis. Then only mayst thou mount\r\nhim, and if thou be man enow to turn him to thy will he shall bear thee\r\nto the uttermost parts of earth unto thine heart’s desire. But if thou\r\nbe aught less than greatest, beware that steed, and mount only earthly\r\ncoursers. For if there be aught of dross within thee, and thine heart\r\nfalter, or thy purpose cool, or thou forget the level aim of thy glory,\r\nthen will he toss thee to thy ruin.”\r\n\r\n“Thou hast this thing, O Queen?” said Lord Juss.\r\n\r\n“My lord,” she said softly, “more than an hundred years ago I found\r\nit, while I rambled on the cliffs that are about this charmed Lake of\r\nRavary. And here I hid it, being taught by the Gods what thing I had\r\nfound and knowing what was foreordained, that certain of earth should\r\ncome at last to Koshtra Belorn. Thinking in my heart that he that\r\nshould come might be of those who bare some great unfulfilled desire,\r\nand might be of such might as could ride to his desire on such a steed.”\r\n\r\nThey abode, talking little, by the charmed lake’s shore till evening.\r\nThen they arose, and went with her to a pavilion by the lake, built in\r\na grove of flowering trees. Ere they went to rest, she brought them the\r\nhippogriff’s egg, great as a man’s body, yet light of weight, rough and\r\ncoloured like gold. And she said, “Which of you, my lords?”\r\n\r\nJuss answered, “He, if might and a high heart should only count; but I,\r\nbecause my brother it is that we must free from his dismal place.”\r\n\r\nSo the Queen gave the egg to Lord Juss; and he, bearing it in his arms,\r\nbade her good-night, saying, “I need no other laudanum than this to\r\nmake me sleep.”\r\n\r\nAnd the ambrosial night came down. And gentle sleep, softer than sleep\r\nis on earth, closed their eyes in that pavilion beside the enchanted\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nMivarsh slept not. Small joy had he of that Lake of Ravary, caring for\r\nnone of its beauties but mindful still of certain lewd bulks he had\r\nseen basking by its shores all through the golden afternoon. He had\r\nquestioned one of the Queen’s martlets concerning them, who laughed at\r\nhim and let him know that these were crocodiles, wardens of the lake,\r\ntame and gentle toward the heroes of bliss who resorted thither to\r\nbathe and disport themselves. “But should such an one as thou,” she\r\nsaid, “adventure there, they would chop thee up at a mouthful.” This\r\nsaddened him. And indeed, little ease of heart had he since he came out\r\nof Impland, and dearly he desired his home, though it were sacked and\r\nburnt, and the men of his own blood, though they should prove his foes.\r\nAnd well he thought that if Juss should fly with Brandoch Daha mounted\r\non hippogriff to that cold mountain top where souls of the great were\r\nheld in bondage, he should never win back alone to the world of men,\r\npast the frozen mountains, and the mantichores, and past the crocodile\r\nthat dwelt beside Bhavinan.\r\n\r\nHe lay awake an hour or twain, weeping quietly, until out of the giant\r\nheart of midnight came to him with fiery clearness the words of the\r\nQueen, saying that by the heat of great longing in his heart that\r\nclaspeth it must that egg be hatched, and that that man should then\r\nmount and ride on the wind unto his heart’s desire. Therewith Mivarsh\r\nsat up, his hands clammy with mixed fear and longing. It seemed to him,\r\nawake and alone among the sleepers in that breathless night, that no\r\nlonging could be greater than his longing. He said in his heart, “I\r\nwill arise, and take the egg privily from the devil transmarine and\r\nclasp it myself. I do him no wrong thereby, for said she not it was\r\nperilous? Also every man raketh the embers to his own cake.”\r\n\r\nSo he arose, and came secretly to Juss where he lay with his strong\r\narms circling the egg. A beam of the moon came in by a window, shining\r\non the face of Juss, that was as the face of a God. Mivarsh bent over\r\nhim and teased the egg gently from his embrace, praying fervently the\r\nwhile. And, for Juss was in a profound slumber, his soul mounting in\r\nvision far from earth, far from that shore divine, to lone regions\r\nwhere Goldry watched still in frozen mournful patience on the heights\r\nof Zora, at last Mivarsh gat the egg and bare it to his bed. Very warm\r\nit was, crackling to his ear as he embraced it, as of a power moving\r\nfrom withinwards.\r\n\r\nIn such wise Mivarsh fell asleep, clasping the egg as a man should\r\nclasp his dearest. And a little before dawn it hatched in his arms\r\nand fell asunder, and he started awake, his arms about the neck of a\r\nstrange steed. It went forth into the pale light before the sunrise,\r\nand he with it, holding it fast. The sheen of its hair was like the\r\npeacock’s neck; its eyes like the changing fires of a star of a windy\r\nnight. Its nostrils widened to the breath of the dawn. Its wings\r\nunfolded and grew stiff, their feathers like the tail-feathers of the\r\npeacock pheasant, white with purple eyes, and hard to the touch as\r\niron blades. Mivarsh was mounted on its back, seizing the shining mane\r\nwith both hands, trembling. And now was he fain to descend, but the\r\nhippogriff snorted and reared, and he, fearing a great fall, clung\r\ncloser. It stamped with its silver hoofs, flapping its wings, ramping\r\nlike a lioness, tearing up the grass with its claws. Mivarsh screamed,\r\ntorn between hope and fear. It plunged forward and leaped into the air\r\nand flew.\r\n\r\nThe Demons, waked by the whirring of wings, rushed from the pavilion,\r\nto behold that marvel flown against the obscure west. Wild was its\r\nflight, like a snipe dipping and plunging. And while they looked, they\r\nsaw the rider flung from his seat and heard, some moments after, a dull\r\nflop and splash of a body fallen in the lake.\r\n\r\nThe wild steed vanished, winging toward the upper air. Rings ran\r\noutward from the splash, troubling the surface of the lake, marring the\r\ndark reflection of Zora Rach mirrored in the sleeping waters.\r\n\r\n“Poor Mivarsh!” cried Lord Brandoch Daha. “After all the weary leagues\r\nI made him go with me.” And he threw off his cloak, took a dagger in\r\nhis teeth, and swam with great over-arm strokes out to the spot where\r\nMivarsh fell. But nought he found of Mivarsh. Only he saw near by on\r\nan island beach a crocodile, big and bloated, that eyed him guiltily\r\nand stayed not for his coming, but lumbering into the water dived and\r\ndisappeared. So Brandoch Daha turned and swam ashore again.\r\n\r\nLord Juss stood as a man stricken to stone. As one despaired he turned\r\nto the Queen, who now came forth to them wrapped in a mantle of\r\nswansdown; yet high he held his head. “O Queen Sophonisba, here is that\r\nsecret glome or bottom of our days, come when we sniffed the sweetness\r\nof the morning.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said she, “the flies hemerae take life with the sun and die\r\nwith the dew. But thou, if thou be truly great, join not hands with\r\ndesperation. Let the sad ending of this poor servant of thine be to\r\nthee a monument against such folly. Earth is not ruined for a single\r\nshower. Come back with me to Koshtra Belorn.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at the grand peak of Zora, dark against the wakening east.\r\n“Madam,” he said, “thou hast little more than half my years, and yet\r\nby another computation thou art seven times mine age. I am not light\r\nof will, nor thou shalt not find me a fool to thee. Let us go back to\r\nKoshtra Belorn.”\r\n\r\nThey brake their fast quietly and returned by the way they came. And\r\nthe Queen said, “My lords Juss and Brandoch Daha, there be few steeds\r\nof such a kind to carry you to Zora Rach nam Psarrion, and not ye,\r\nthough ye be beyond the half-gods in your might and virtue, might have\r\npower to ride them but if ye take them from the egg. So high they fly,\r\nso shy they are, ye should not catch them though ye waited ten men’s\r\nlifetimes. I will send my martlets to see if there be another egg in\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\nSo she despatched them, north and west and south and east. And in due\r\ntime those little birds returned on weary wing, all save one, without\r\ntidings.\r\n\r\n“All have come back to me,” said the Queen, “save Arabella alone.\r\nDangers attend them in the world: birds of prey, men that slay little\r\nbirds for their sport. Yet hope with me that she may come back at last.”\r\n\r\nBut the Lord Juss spake and said, “O Queen Sophonisba, to hope and wait\r\nlieth not in my nature, but to be swift, resolute, and exact whensoever\r\nI see my way before me. This have I ever approved, that the strawberry\r\ngroweth underneath the nettle still. I will assay the ascent of Zora.”\r\n\r\nNor might all her prayers turn him from this rashness, wherein the\r\nLord Brandoch Daha besides did most eagerly second him.\r\n\r\nTwo nights and two days they were gone, and the Queen abode them in\r\ngreat trouble of heart in her pavilion by the enchanted lake. The third\r\nevening came Brandoch Daha back to the pavilion, bringing with him Juss\r\nthat was like a man at point of death, and himself besides deadly sick.\r\n\r\n“Tell me not anything,” said the Queen. “Forgetfulness is the only\r\nsovran remedy, which with all my art I will strive to induce in thy\r\nmind and in his. Surely I despaired ever to see you in life again, so\r\nrashly entered into those regions forbid.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha smiled, but his look was ghastly. “Blame us not overmuch,\r\ndear Queen. Who shoots at the mid-day sun, though he be sure he shall\r\nnever hit the mark, yet as sure he is he shall shoot higher than who\r\naims but at a bush.” His voice broke in his throat; the whites of his\r\neyes rolled up; he caught at the Queen’s hand like a frightened child.\r\nThen with a mighty effort mastering himself, “I pray bear with me a\r\nlittle,” he said. “After a little good meats and drinks taken ’twill\r\npass. I pray look to Juss: is a dead, think you?”\r\n\r\nDays passed, and months, and the Lord Juss lay yet as it were in\r\nthe article of death tended by his friend and by the Queen in that\r\npavilion by the lake. At length when winter was gone in middle earth,\r\nand the spring far spent, back came that last little martlet on weary\r\nwing, she they had long given up for lost. She sank in her mistress’s\r\nbosom, almost dead indeed for weariness. But the Queen cherished her,\r\nand gave her nectar, so that she gathered strength and said, “O Queen\r\nSophonisba, fosterling of the Gods, I flew for thee east and south\r\nand west and north, by sea and by land, in heat and frost, unto the\r\nfrozen poles, about and about. And at the last came to Demonland, to\r\nthe range of Neverdale. There is a tarn among the mountains, that men\r\ncall Dule Tarn. Very deep it is, and men that live by bread do hold\r\nit for bottomless. Yet hath it a bottom, and on the bottom lieth an\r\nhippogriff’s egg, seen by me, for I flew at a great height above it.”\r\n\r\n“In Demonland!” said the Queen. And she said to Lord Brandoch Daha, “It\r\nis the only one. Ye must go home to fetch it.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha said, “Home to Demonland? After we spent our powers and\r\ncrossed the world to find the way?”\r\n\r\nBut when Lord Juss knew of it, straightway with hope so renewed began\r\nhis sickness to depart from him, so that he was in a few weeks’ space\r\nvery well recovered.\r\n\r\nAnd it was now a full year gone by since first the Demons came up into\r\nKoshtra Belorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          XV: QUEEN PREZMYRA\r\n\r\n  HOW THE LADY PREZMYRA DISCOVERED TO LORD GRO WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE\r\n      BROUGHT ABOUT FOR DEMONLAND, IN WHICH SHOULD ALSO APPEAR HER\r\n      LORD’S YET MORE GREATNESS AND ADVANCEMENT: AND HOW HER TOO\r\n      LOUD SPEAKING OF HER PURPOSE WAS THE OCCASION WHEREBY THE LORD\r\n      CORINIUS WAS TO LEARN THE SWEETNESS OF BLISS DEFERRED.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that same twenty-sixth night of May, when Lord Juss and Lord\r\nBrandoch Daha beheld from earth’s loftiest pinnacle the land of\r\nZimiamvia and Koshtra Belorn, Gro walked with the Lady Prezmyra on\r\nthe western terrace in Carcë. It wanted yet two hours of midnight.\r\nThe air was warm, the sky a bower of moonbeam and starbeam. Now and\r\nthen a faint breeze stirred as if night turned in her sleep. The walls\r\nof the palace and the Iron Tower cut off the terrace from the direct\r\nmoonlight, and flamboys spreading their wobbling light made alternating\r\nregions of brightness and gloom. Galloping strains of music and the\r\nnoise of revelry came from within the palace.\r\n\r\nGro spake: “If thy question, O Queen, overlie a wish to have me gone, I\r\nam as lightning to obey thee howsoe’er it grieve me.”\r\n\r\n“’Twas an idle wonder only,” she said. “Stay and it like thee.”\r\n\r\n“It is but a native part of wisdom,” said he, “to follow the light.\r\nWhen thou wast departed from the hall methought all the bright lights\r\nwere bedimmed.” He looked at her sidelong as they passed into the\r\nradiance of a flamboy, studying her countenance that seemed clouded\r\nwith grievous thought. Fair of all fairs she seemed, stately and\r\nsplendid; crowned with a golden crown set about with dark amethysts. A\r\nfigure of a crab-fish topped it above the brow, curiously wrought in\r\nsilver and bearing in either claw a ball of chrysolite the bigness of a\r\nthrush’s egg.\r\n\r\nLord Gro said, “This too was part of my mind, to behold those stars in\r\nheaven that men call Berenice’s Hair, and know if they can outshine in\r\nglory thine hair, O Queen.”\r\n\r\nThey paced on in silence. Then, “These phrases of forced gallantry,”\r\nshe said, “sort ill with our friendship, my Lord Gro. If I be not\r\nangry, think it is because I father them on the deep healths thou hast\r\ncaroused unto our Lord the King on this night of nights, when the\r\nreturning year bringeth back the date of his sending, and our vengeance\r\nupon Demonland.”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” he said, “I would but have thee give over this melancholy.\r\nSeemeth it to thee a little thing that the King hath pleased so\r\nsingularly to honour Corund thy husband as give him a king’s style\r\nand dignity and all Impland to hold in fee? All took notice of it how\r\nuncheerfully thou didst receive this royal crown when the King gave\r\nit thee to-night, in honour of thy great lord, to wear in his stead\r\ntill he come home to claim it; this, and the great praise spoke by the\r\nKing of Corund, which methinks should bring the warmth of pride to thy\r\ncheeks. Yet are all these things of as little avail against thy frozen\r\nscornful melancholy as the weak winter sun availeth against congealed\r\npools in a black frost.”\r\n\r\n“Crowns are cheap trash to-day,” said Prezmyra; “whenas the King, with\r\ntwenty kings to be his lackeys, raiseth up now his lackeys to be kings\r\nof the earth. Canst wonder if my joyance in this crown were dashed some\r\nlittle when I looked on that other given by the King to Laxus?”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” said Gro, “thou must forgive Laxus in his own particular. Thou\r\nknowest he set not so much as a foot in Pixyland; and if now he must be\r\ncalled king thereof, that should rather please thee, being in despite\r\nof Corinius that carried war there and by whatsoever means of skill or\r\nfortune overcame thy noble brother and drave him into exile.”\r\n\r\n“Corinius,” she answered, “tasteth in that miss that bane or ill-hap\r\nwhich I dearly pray all they may groan under who would fatten by my\r\nbrother’s ruin.”\r\n\r\n“Then should Corinius’s grief lift up thy joy,” said Gro. “Yet certain\r\nit is, Fate is a blind puppy: build not on her next turn.”\r\n\r\n“Am not I a Queen?” said Prezmyra. “Is not this Witchland? Have we not\r\nstrength to make curses strong, if Fate be blind indeed?”\r\n\r\nThey halted at the head of a flight of steps leading down to the inner\r\nward. The Lady Prezmyra leaned awhile on the black marble balustrade,\r\ngazing seaward over the level marshes rough with moonlight. “What care\r\nI for Laxus?” she said at last. “What care I for Corinius? A cast of\r\nhawks flown by the King against a quarry that in dearworthiness and\r\nnobility outshineth an hundred such as they. Nor I will not suffer mine\r\nindignation so to witwanton with fair justice as persuade me to put\r\nthe wite on Witchland. It is most true the Prince my brother practised\r\nwith our enemies the downthrow of our fortunes, breaking open, had he\r\nbut known it, the gate of destruction for himself and us, that night\r\nwhen our banquet was turned by him to a battle and our winey mirths to\r\nbloody rages.” She was silent for a time, then said, “Oathbreakers: a\r\nmost odious name, flat against all humanity. Two faces in one hood. O\r\nthat earth would start up and strike the sins that tread on her!”\r\n\r\n“I see thou lookest west over sea,” said Gro.\r\n\r\n“There’s somewhat thou canst see, then, my Lord Gro, by owl-light,”\r\nsaid Prezmyra.\r\n\r\n“Thou didst tell me at the time,” he said, “with what compliments in\r\nvows and strange well-studied promises of friendship the Lord Juss took\r\nleave of thee at their escaping out of Carcë. Yet art thou to blame, O\r\nQueen, if thou take in too ill part the breaking of such promises given\r\nin extremity, which prove commonly like fish, new, stale, and stinking\r\nin three days.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, ’tis a small matter,” said she, “that my brother should cast\r\naside all ties of interest and alliance to save these great ones from\r\nan evil death; and they, being delivered, should toss him a light\r\ngrammercy and go their ways, leaving him to be exterminated out of his\r\nown country and, for all they know or reck, to lose his life. May the\r\ngreat Devil of Hell torture their souls!”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” said Lord Gro, “I would have thee view the matter soberly, and\r\nleave these bitter flashes. The Demons did save thy brother once in\r\nLida Nanguna, and his delivering of them out of the hand of our Lord\r\nthe King was but just payment therefor. The scales hang equal.”\r\n\r\nShe answered, “Do not defile mine ears with their excuses. They have\r\nshamefully abused us; and the guilt of their black deed planteth them\r\nday by day more firmlier in my deeper-settled hate. Art thou so deeply\r\nread in nature and her large philosophy, and I am yet to teach thee\r\nthat deadliest hellebore or the vomit of a toad are qualified poison to\r\nthe malice of a woman?”\r\n\r\nThe darkness of a great cloud-bank spreading from the south swallowed\r\nup the moonlight. Prezmyra turned to resume her slow pacing down the\r\nterrace. The yellow fiery sparkles in her eyes glinted in the flamboys’\r\nflare. She looked dangerous as a lioness, and delicate and graceful\r\nlike an antelope. Gro walked beside her, saying, “Did not Corund drive\r\nthem forth in winter on to the Moruna, and can they continue there in\r\nlife, alone amid so many devouring perils?”\r\n\r\n“O my lord,” she cried, “say these good tidings to the kitchen wenches,\r\nnot to me. Why, thyself didst enter in past years the very heart of the\r\nMoruna and yet camest off, else art thou the greatest liar. This only\r\ncankerfrets my soul: that days go by, and months, and Witchland beateth\r\ndown all peoples under him, and yet he suffereth the crown of pride,\r\nthese rebels of Demonland, to go yet untrodden under feet. Doth he deem\r\nit the better part to spare a foe and spoil a friend? That were an\r\nunhappy and unnatural conclusion. Or is he fey, even as was Gorice XI.?\r\nHeaven foreshield it, yet as ill an end may bechance him and utter ruin\r\ncome on all of us if he will withhold his scourge from Demonland until\r\nJuss and Brandoch Daha come home again to meet with him.”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” said Lord Gro, “in these few words thou hast given me the\r\npicture of mine own mind in small. And forgive me that I bespake thee\r\nwarily at the first, for these are matters of heavy moment, and ere\r\nI opened my mind to thee I would know that it agreed with thine. Let\r\nthe King smite now, in the happy absence of their greatest champions.\r\nSo shall we be in strength against them if they return again, and\r\nperchance Goldry with them.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and it seemed as if all the sultry night freshened and\r\nsweetened at that lady’s smile. “Thou art a dear companion to me,” she\r\nsaid. “Thy melancholy is to me as some shady wood in summer, where\r\nI may dance if I will, and that is often, or be sad if I will, and\r\nthat is in these days oftener than I would: and never thou crossest\r\nmy mood. Save but now thou didst so, to plague me with thy precious\r\nflattering jargon, till I had thought thee skin-changed with Laxus or\r\nyoung Corinius, seeking such lures as gallants spread their wings to,\r\nto stoop in ladies’ bosoms.”\r\n\r\n“For I would shake thee from this late-received sadness,” said Gro. And\r\nhe said, “Thou art to commend me too, since I spake nought but truth.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, have done, my lord,” she cried, “or I’ll dismiss thee hence.” And\r\nas they walked Prezmyra sang softly:\r\n\r\n    He that cannot chuse but love,\r\n    And strives against it still,\r\n    Never shall my fancy move,\r\n    For he loves ’gaynst his will;\r\n    Nor he which is all his own,\r\n    And can att pleasure chuse;\r\n    When I am caught he can be gone,\r\n    And when he list refuse.\r\n    Nor he that loves none but faire,\r\n    For such by all are sought;\r\n    Nor he that can for foul ones care,\r\n    For his Judgement then is naught;\r\n    Nor he——\r\n\r\nShe broke off suddenly, saying, “Come, I have shook off the ill\r\ndisposition the sight of Laxus bred in me and of his tawdry crown.\r\nLet’s think on action. And first, I will tell thee a thing. This we\r\nspoke of hath been in my mind these two or three moons, ever since\r\nCorinius’s campaigning in Pixyland. So when word came of my lord’s\r\ndestroying of the Demon host, and his driving of Juss and Brandoch Daha\r\nlike runaway thralls on the Moruna, I sent him a letter by the hand of\r\nViglus that bare him from our Lord the King the king’s name in Impland.\r\nTherein I expressed how that the crown of Demonland should be a braver\r\ncrown for us than this of Impland, howsoe’er it sparkle, praying him\r\nurge upon the King his sending of an armament to Demonland, and my lord\r\nthe leader thereof; or, if he could not as then come home to ask it,\r\nthen I entreated him make me his ambassador to lay this counsel before\r\nthe King and crave the enterprise for Corund.”\r\n\r\n“Is not his answer in those letters I brought thee?” said Gro.\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said she, “and a very scurvy beggarly lickspittle answer for a\r\ngreat lord to send to such a matter as I propounded. Alack, it puffs\r\naway all my wifely duty but to speak on’t, and makes me rail like a\r\ngangrel-woman.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll walk apart, madam,” said Gro, “if thou wouldst have privateness\r\nto deliver thy mind.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra laughed. “’Tis not all so bad,” she said, “and yet it makes me\r\nangry. The enterprise he commends, up to the hilt, and I have his leave\r\nto broach it to the King, as his mouth-piece, and press it with him out\r\nof all ho. But for the leading on’t, he will not have it, he. Corsus\r\nmust have it, or Corinius. Stay, let me read it out,” and standing near\r\none of the lights she took a parchment from her bosom. “Pooh! ’tis too\r\nfond; I will not shame my lord to read it, even to thee.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Gro, “were I the King, Corund should be my general to put\r\ndown Demonland. Corsus he may send, for he hath done great work in\r\nhis day, but in mine own judgement I like him not for such an errand.\r\nCorinius he hath not yet forgiven for his fault at the banquet a year\r\nago.”\r\n\r\n“Corinius!” said Prezmyra. “So his butchery of mine own dear land goeth\r\nnot only without reward, but hath not so much as bought him back to\r\nfavour, thou thinkest?”\r\n\r\n“I think not,” said Lord Gro. “Besides, he is mad wroth to have\r\nplucked that prickly fruit but for another’s eating. He bare himself\r\nso presumptuous-ill in the hall to-night, gleeking and galling at\r\nLaxus, slapping of his sword, and with so many more shameless braves\r\nand wanton fashions, and worst of all his most openly seeking to toy\r\nwith Sriva, i’ this first month of her betrothal unto Laxus, it will\r\nbe a wonder if blood be not spilt betwixt them ere the night be done.\r\nMethinks he is not i’ the mood to take the field again without some\r\nsure reward; and methinks the King, guessing his mind, would not offer\r\nhim a new enterprise and so give him the glory of refusing it.”\r\n\r\nThey stood near the arched gateway that opened on the terrace from the\r\ninner court. Music still sounded from the great banquet hall of Gorice\r\nXI. Under the archway and in the shadows of the huge buttresses of the\r\nwalls it was as though the elements of gloom, expelled from the bright\r\ncircles round the flamboys, huddled with sister glooms to make a double\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n“Well, my lord,” said Prezmyra, “doth thy wisdom bless my resolve?”\r\n\r\n“Whate’er it be, yes, because it is thine, O Queen.”\r\n\r\n“Whate’er it be!” she cried. “Dost hang in doubt on’t? What else, but\r\nseek audience with the King as my first care in the morning. Have I not\r\nmy lord’s bidding so far?”\r\n\r\n“And if thy zeal outrun his bidding in one particular?” said Gro.\r\n\r\n“Why, just!” said she. “And if I bring thee not word ere to-morrow’s\r\nnoon that order is given for Demonland, and my Lord Corund named his\r\ngeneral for that sailing, ay, and letters sealed for his straight\r\nrecall from Orpish——”\r\n\r\n“Hist!” said Gro. “Steps i’ the court.”\r\n\r\nThey turned towards the archway, Prezmyra singing under her breath:\r\n\r\n    Nor he that still his Mistresse payes,\r\n    For she is thrall’d therefore;\r\n    Nor he that payes not, for he sayes\r\n    Within, shee’s worth no more.\r\n    Is there then no kinde of men\r\n    Whom I may freely prove?\r\n    I will vent that humour then\r\n    In mine own selfe love.\r\n\r\nCorinius met them in the gateway, coming from the banquet house. He\r\nhalted full in their path to peer closely through the darkness at\r\nPrezmyra, so that she felt the heat of his breath, heavy with wine. It\r\nwas too dark to know faces but he knew her by her stature and bearing.\r\n\r\n“Cry thee mercy, madam,” he said. “Methought an instant ’twas—but no\r\nmatter. Your best of rest.”\r\n\r\nSo saying he made way for her with a deep obeisance, jostling roughly\r\nagainst Gro with the same motion. Gro, little minded for a quarrel,\r\ngave him the wall, and followed Prezmyra into the inner court.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe Lord Corinius sat him down on the nearest of the benches, leaned\r\nhis stalwart back luxuriously upon the cushions and there rested,\r\nthripping his fingers and singing to himself:\r\n\r\n    What an Ass is he\r\n      Waits a woman’s leisure\r\n      For a minute’s pleasure,\r\n    And perhaps may be\r\n      Gull’d at last, and lose her;\r\n    What an ass is he?\r\n\r\n    What need I to care\r\n      For a woman’s favour?\r\n      If another have her,\r\n    Why should I despair?\r\n      When for gold and labour\r\n    I can have my share.\r\n\r\n    If I chance to see\r\n      One that’s brown, I love her,\r\n      Till I see another\r\n    Browner is than she;\r\n      For I am a lover\r\n    Of my liberty.\r\n\r\nA rustle behind him on his left made him turn his head. A figure stole\r\nout of the deep shadow of the buttress nearest the archway. He leapt up\r\nand was first in the gate, blocking it with open arms. “Ah,” he cried,\r\n“so titmice roost i’ the shade, ha? What ransom shall I have of thee\r\nfor making me keep empty tryst last night? Ay, and wast creeping hence\r\nto make me a fool once more the night-long and I had not caught thee.”\r\n\r\nThe lady laughed. “Last night my father kept me by him; and to-night,\r\nmy lord, wouldst thou not have been fitly served for thy shameless\r\nditty? Is that a sweet serenade for ladies’ ears? Sing it again, to thy\r\nliberty, and show thyself an ass.”\r\n\r\n“Thou art very bold to provoke me, madam, with not even a star to be\r\nthy witness if I quite thee for’t. These flamboys are old roisterers,\r\ngrown gray in scenes of riot. They shall not blab.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, if thou speakest in wine I’m gone, my lord;” and as he took a\r\nstep towards her, “and I return not, here or otherwise, but fling thee\r\noff for ever,” she said. “I will not be entreated like a serving-maid.\r\nI have borne too long with thy forced soldier fashions.”\r\n\r\nCorinius caught his arms about her, lifting her against his broad chest\r\nso that her toes scarce kept footing on the ground. “O Sriva,” he said\r\nthickly, bending his face to hers, “dost think to light so great a\r\nfire, and after walk through it and not be scorched thereat?”\r\n\r\nHer arms were close pinioned at her sides in that strong embrace. She\r\nseemed to swoon, as a lily swooning in the flaming noon-day. Corinius\r\nbent down his face and kissed her fiercely, saying, “By all the sweets\r\nthat ever darkness tasted, thou art mine to-night.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow,” she said, as if stifled.\r\n\r\nBut Corinius said, “My dearest happiness, to-night.”\r\n\r\n“My dear lord,” said the Lady Sriva softly, “sith thou hast made such\r\na conquest of my love, be not a harsh and froward conqueror. I swear\r\nto thee by all the dreadful powers that clip the earth about, there’s\r\nmatter in it I should to my father this night, nay more, now on the\r\ninstant. ’Twas this only made me avoid thee but now: this, and no light\r\nconceit to vex thee.”\r\n\r\n“He can attend our pleasure,” said Corinius. “’Tis an old man, and oft\r\nsitteth late at his book.”\r\n\r\n“How? and thou leftest him carousing?” said she. “There’s that I must\r\nimpart to him ere the wine quite o’erflow his wits. Even this delay,\r\nhow sweet soe’er to us, is dangerous.”\r\n\r\nBut Corinius said, “I will not let thee go.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said she, “be a beast, then. But know I’ll cry on a rescue\r\nshall make all Carcë run to find us, and my brothers, ay, and Laxus,\r\nif he be a man, shall deal thee bitter payment for thy violence toward\r\nme. But if thou wilt be thy noble self, and respect my love with\r\nfriendship, let me go. And if thou come secretly to my chamber door, an\r\nhour past midnight; I think thou’lt find no bolt to it.”\r\n\r\n“Ha, thou swearest it?” he said.\r\n\r\nShe answered, “Else may steep destruction swallow me quick.”\r\n\r\n“An hour past midnight. And until then ’tis a year in my desires,” said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n“There spoke my noble lover,” said Sriva, giving him her mouth once\r\nmore. And swiftly she fared through the shadowy archway and across the\r\ncourt to where in the north gallery her father Corsus had his chamber.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Corinius went back to his seat, and there reclined for a space\r\nin slothful ease, humming to an old tune:\r\n\r\n    My Mistris is a shittle-cock,\r\n      Compos’d of Cork and feather;\r\n    Each Battledore sets on her dock,\r\n      And bumps her on the leather.\r\n      But cast her off which way you Will,\r\n      She will requoile to another still—\r\n    Fa, la, la, la, la, la.\r\n\r\nHe stretched his arms and yawned. “Well, Laxus, my chub-faced meacock,\r\nthis medicine hath eased powerfully my discontent. ’Tis but fair, sith\r\nI must miss my crown, that I should have thy mistress. And to say true,\r\nseeing how base, little, and ordinary a kingdom is this of Pixyland,\r\nand what a delectable sweet wagtail this Sriva, whom besides I have\r\nthese two years past ne’er looked on but my mouth watered: why, I may\r\nhold me part paid for the nonce; until I weary of her.\r\n\r\n    Love is all my life,\r\n      For it keeps me doing:\r\n      Yet my love and wooing\r\n    Is not for a Wife—\r\n\r\n“An hour past midnight, ha? What wine’s best for lovers? I’ll go drink\r\na stoup, and so to dice with some of these lads to pass away the time\r\ntill then.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    XVI: THE LADY SRIVA’S EMBASSAGE\r\n\r\n  HOW THE DUKE CORSUS THOUGHT IT PROPER TO COMMIT AN ERRAND OF STATE\r\n      UNTO HIS DAUGHTER: AND HOW SHE PROSPERED THEREIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSriva fared swiftly to her father’s closet, and finding her lady mother\r\nsewing in her chair, nodding toward sleep, two candles at her left\r\nand right, she said, “My lady mother, there’s a queen’s crown waits\r\nthe plucking. ’Twill drop into the foreign woman’s lap if thou and my\r\nfather bestir you not. Where is he? Still i’ the banquet house? Thou or\r\nI must fetch him on the instant.”\r\n\r\n“Fie!” cried Zenambria. “How thou’st startled me! Fall somewhat into a\r\nslower speech, my girl. With such wild sudden talk I know not what thou\r\nmeanest nor what’s the matter.”\r\n\r\nBut Sriva answered, “Matter of state. Thou goest not? Good, then I\r\nfetch him. Thou shalt hear all anon, mother;” and so turned towards\r\nthe door. Nor might all her mother’s crying out upon the scandal of\r\ntheir so returning to the banquet long past the hour of the women’s\r\nwithdrawal turn her from this. So that the Lady Zenambria, seeing her\r\nso wilful, thought it less evil to go herself; and so went, and in\r\nawhile returned with Corsus.\r\n\r\nCorsus sat in his great chair over against his lady wife, while his\r\ndaughter told her tale.\r\n\r\n“Twice and thrice,” said she, “they passed me by, as near as I stand to\r\nthee, O my father, she leaning most familiarly on the arm of her curled\r\nphilosopher. ’Twas plain they had never a thought that any was by to\r\noverhear them. She said so and so;” and therewith Sriva told all that\r\nwas spoke by the Lady Prezmyra as to an expedition to Demonland, and\r\nas to her purposed speaking with the King, and as to her design that\r\nCorund should be his general for that sailing, and letters sealed on\r\nthe morrow for his straight recall from Orpish.\r\n\r\nThe Duke listened unmoved, breathing heavily, leaning heavily forward,\r\nhis elbow on his knees, one great fat hand twisting and pushing back\r\nthe sparse gray growth of his moustachios. His eyes shifted with sullen\r\nglance about the chamber, and his blabber cheeks, scarlet from the\r\nfeast, flushed to a deeper hue.\r\n\r\nZenambria said, “Alas, and did not I tell thee long ago, my lord, that\r\nCorund did ill to wed with a young wife? And thence cometh now that\r\nshame that was but to be looked for. It is pity indeed of so goodly a\r\nman, now past his prime age, she should so play at fast and loose with\r\nhis honour, and he at the far end of the world. Indeed and indeed,\r\nI hope he will revenge it on her at his coming home. For sure I am,\r\nCorund is too high-minded to buy advancement at so shameful a price.”\r\n\r\n“Thy talk, wife,” said Corsus, “showeth long hair and a short wit. In\r\nbrief, thou art a fool.”\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a space, then raised his gaze to Sriva, where she\r\nrested, her back to the massive table, half standing, half sitting, a\r\ndainty jewel-besparkled hand planted on the table’s edge at her either\r\nside, her arms like delicate white pillars supporting that fair frame.\r\nSomewhat his dull eye brightened, resting on her. “Come hither,” he\r\nsaid, “on my knee: so.”\r\n\r\nWhen she was seated, “’Tis a brave gown,” said he, “thou wearest\r\nto-night, my pretty pug. Red, for a sanguine humour.” His great arm\r\ngave her a back, and his hand, huge as a platter, lay like a buckler\r\nbeneath her breast. “Thou smell’st passing sweet.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis malabathrum in the leaf,” answered she.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad it likes thee, my lord,” said Zenambria. “My woman still\r\nprotesteth that such, being boiled with wine, yieldeth a perfume that\r\npasseth all other.”\r\n\r\nCorsus still looked on Sriva. After a while he asked, “What madest thou\r\non the terrace i’ the dark, ha?”\r\n\r\nShe looked down, saying, “It was Laxus prayed me meet him there.”\r\n\r\n“Hum!” said Corsus, “’Tis strange then he should await thee this hour\r\ngone by in the paved alley of the privy court.”\r\n\r\n“He did mistake me,” said Sriva. “And well is he served, for such\r\nneglect.”\r\n\r\n“So. And thou turnest politician to-night, my little puss-cat?” said\r\nCorsus. “And thou smellest an expedition to Demonland? ’Tis like enow.\r\nBut methinks the King will send Corinius.”\r\n\r\n“Corinius?” said Sriva. “It is not thought so. ’Tis Corund must have\r\nit, if thou push not the matter to a decision with the King to-night, O\r\nmy father, ere my lady fox be private with him to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” said Corsus. “Thou art but a girl, and knowest nought. She hath\r\nnot the full blood nor the resolution to carry it thus. No, ’tis not\r\nCorund stands i’ the light, it is Corinius. It is therefore the King\r\nwithheld from him Pixyland, which was his due, and tossed the bauble to\r\nLaxus.”\r\n\r\n“Why, ’tis a monstrous thing,” said Zenambria, “if Corinius shall have\r\nDemonland, which surely much surpasseth this crown of Pixyland. Shall\r\nthis novice have all the meat, and thou, because thou art old, have\r\nnought but the bones and the parings?”\r\n\r\n“Hold thy tongue, mistress,” said Corsus, looking upon her as one\r\nlooketh on a sour mixture. “Why hadst not the wit to angle for him for\r\nthy daughter?”\r\n\r\n“Truly, husband, I’m sorry for it,” said Zenambria.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Sriva laughed, placing her arm about her father’s bullock-neck\r\nand playing with his whiskers. “Content thee,” she said, “my lady\r\nmother. I have my choice, and that is very certain, of these and of all\r\nother in Carcë. And now I bethink me on the Lord Corinius, why, there’s\r\na proper man indeed: weareth a shaven lip too, which, as experienced\r\nopinion shall tell thee, far exceedeth your nasty moustachios.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Corsus, kissing her, “howe’er it shape, I’ll to the King\r\nto-night to move my matter with him. Meanwhile, madam,” he said to\r\nZenambria, “I’ll have thee take thy chamber straight. Bolt well the\r\ndoor, and for more safety I will lock it myself o’ the outer side.\r\nThere’s much mirth toward to-night, and I’d not have these staggering\r\ndrunken swads offend thee, as full well might befall, whiles I am on\r\nmine errand of state.”\r\n\r\nZenambria bade him good-night, and would have taken her daughter with\r\nher, but Corsus said nay to this, saying, “I’ll see her safe bestowed.”\r\n\r\nWhen they were alone, and the Lady Zenambria locked away in her\r\nchamber, Corsus took forth from an oaken cupboard a great silver flagon\r\nand two chased goblets. These he brimmed with a sparkling yellow wine\r\nfrom the flagon and made Sriva drink with him not once only but twice,\r\nemptying each time her goblet. Then he drew up his chair and sinking\r\nheavily into it folded his arms upon the table and buried his head upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSriva paced back and forth, impatient at her father’s strange posture\r\nand silence. Surely the wine lighted riot in her veins; surely in that\r\nsilent room came back to her Corinius’s kisses hot upon her mouth,\r\nthe strength of his arms like bands of bronze holding her embraced.\r\nMidnight tolled. Her bones seemed to melt within her as she bethought\r\nher of her promise, due in an hour.\r\n\r\n“Father,” said she at last, “midnight hath stricken. Wilt thou not go\r\nere it be too late?”\r\n\r\nThe Duke raised his face and looked at her. He answered “No.” “No,”\r\nhe said again, “where’s the profit? I wax old, my daughter, and must\r\nwither. The world is to the young. To Corinius; to Laxus; to thee. But\r\nmost of all to Corund, who if a be old yet hath his mess of sons, and\r\nmightiest of all his wife, to be his ladder to climb thrones withal.”\r\n\r\n“But thou saidst but now——” said Sriva.\r\n\r\n“Ay, when thy mammy was by. She cometh to her second childhood before\r\nher time, so as to a child I speak to her. Corund did ill to wed with\r\na young wife, ha? Phrut! Is not this the very bulwark and rampire of\r\nhis fortune? Didst ever see a fellow so spurted up in a moment? My\r\nsecretary when I managed the old wars against the Ghouls, and now\r\nclimbed clean over me, that am yet nine year his elder. Called king,\r\nforsooth, and like to be ta’en soon (under the King) for Dominus fac\r\ntotum throughout all the land if a play this woman as a should. Will\r\nnot the King, for such payment as she intends, give Demonland upon\r\nImpland and all the world beside? Hell’s dignity, that would I, and\r\n’twere offered me.”\r\n\r\nHe stood up, reaching unsteadily for the wine jug. Furtively he watched\r\nhis daughter, shifting his gaze ever as her eye met his.\r\n\r\n“Corund,” said he, pouring out some wine, “would split his sides for\r\nlaughter to hear thy mother’s prim-mouthed brabble: he that hath\r\nenjoined upon his wife, there’s ne’er a doubt on’t, this very errand,\r\nand if he visit it on her at his coming home ’twill but be with hotter\r\nlove and gratitude for that she wins him in our despite. Trust me, ’tis\r\nnot every lady of quality shall find favour with a King.”\r\n\r\nThe casement stood open, and while they stood without speech sounds of\r\na lute trembled upward from the court below, and a man’s voice, soft\r\nand deep, singing this song:\r\n\r\n      Hornes to the bull,\r\n        Hooves to the steede,\r\n      To little hayres\r\n        Light feete for speed,\r\n    And unto lions she giveth tethe\r\n      A-gaping dangerouslye.\r\n\r\n      Fishes to swim,\r\n        And birds to flye,\r\n      And men to judge\r\n        And reeson why,\r\n    She teacheth. Yet for womankind\r\n      None of these thinges hath she.\r\n\r\n      For women beautie\r\n        She hath made\r\n      Their onely shielde\r\n        Their onely blade.\r\n    O’er sword and fire they triumph stille,\r\n      Soe they but beautious be.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Sriva knew it was Laxus singing to her chamber window. Her\r\nblood beat wildly, the spirit of enterprise winging her imagination not\r\ntoward him, nor yet Corinius, but into paths strangely and perilously\r\ninviting, undreamed of until now. The Duke her father came towards her,\r\nthrusting the chairs from his way, and saying, “Corund and his mess of\r\nsons! Corund and his young Queen! If he conjure with the white rose,\r\nwhy not thou and I with the red? It hath as fair a look, the devil damn\r\nme else, and savoureth as excellent sweet perfume.”\r\n\r\nShe stared at him big-eyed, with blushing cheeks. He took her hands in\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n“Shall this outland woman,” he said, “and her sallow-cheeked gallant\r\nstill ruffle it over us? Long beards, whether they be white or black,\r\nare too huge a blemish in our eye, methinks. The thing seemeth not\r\nsupportable, that this precise madam with her foreign fashions—Dost\r\nfear to stand i’ the field against her?”\r\n\r\nSriva put her forehead on his shoulder and said, scarce to be heard,\r\n“And it come to that, I’ll show thee.”\r\n\r\n“It must be now,” said Corsus. “Prezmyra, thou hast told me, seeketh\r\naudience betimes i’ the morning. Women are best at night-time, too.”\r\n\r\n“If Laxus should hear thee!” she said.\r\n\r\nHe answered, “Tush, he need never blame thee, even if he knew on’t, and\r\nwe can manage that. Thy silly mother prated but now of honour. ’Tis\r\nbut a school-name; and if ’twere other, tell me whence springeth the\r\nfount of honour if not from the King of Kings? If he receive thee, then\r\nart thou honoured, and all they that have to do with thee. I am yet to\r\nlearn dishonour lieth on that man or woman whom the King doth honour.”\r\n\r\nShe laughed, turning from him toward the window, her hands still held\r\nin his. “Foh, thou hast given me a strong potion! and I think that\r\nswayeth me more than thy many arguments, O my father, which to say\r\ntruth I cannot well remember because I did not much believe.”\r\n\r\nDuke Corsus took her by the shoulders. His face overlooked her by a\r\nlittle, for she was not tall of build. “By the Gods,” he said, “’tis a\r\nstronger sweet scent of the red rose to make a great man drunk withal\r\nthan of the white, though that be a bigger flower.” And he said, “Why\r\nnot, for a game, for a madcap jest? A mantle and hood, a mask if thou\r\nwilt, and my ring to prove thee mine ambassador. I’ll attend thee\r\nthrough the court-yard to the foot o’ the stairs.”\r\n\r\nShe said nothing, smiling at him as she turned for him to put the great\r\nvelvet mantle about her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Ha,” said he, “’tis well seen a daughter is worth ten sons.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Gorice the King sate in his private chamber writing\r\nat a parchment spread before him on the table of polished marmolite.\r\nA silver lamp burned at his left elbow. The window stood open to the\r\nnight. The King had laid aside his crown, that sparkled darkly in the\r\nshadow below the lamp. He put down his pen and read again what he had\r\nwrit, in manner following:\r\n\r\n  Fram Me, Gorice the Twelft, Greate Kyng of Wychlande and of\r\n  Ympelande and of Daemonlande and of al kyngdomes the sonne\r\n  dothe spread hys bemes over, unto Corsus My servaunte: Thys is\r\n  to signifye to the that thoue shalt with all convenient spede\r\n  repaire with a suffycyaunt strengthe of menne and schyppes to\r\n  Daemonlande, bycause that untowarde and traytorly cattell that doe\r\n  there inhabyt are to fele by the the sharpnes of My correctioun.\r\n  I wyll the, as holdynge the place of My generalle ther, that thow\r\n  enter forcybly ynto the sayd cuntrie and doe with al dilygence\r\n  spoyl ravysche and depopulate that lande, enslavying oppressyng\r\n  and puttyng to the dethe as thow shalt thynke moost servychable al\r\n  them that shal fall ynto thy powre, and in pertyculer pullyng downe\r\n  and ruinating all thayr stronge houlds or castels, as Galinge,\r\n  Dreppabie, Crothryng, Owleswyke, and othere. Thys enterpryse in\r\n  head is one of the gretest that ever was since yt is to trampe\r\n  downe Daemonlande and once and for al to cutt thayr coames whose\r\n  crestes may daunger us, and thow art toe onderstande that withowt\r\n  extraordinair experiens of thy former merrits I wolde not commyt\r\n  to the so greate a chairge, and especially in such a tyme. And\r\n  since al gret enterpryses oughte to bee sodeynly and resolutely\r\n  prosequuted, therefore thys oughte to bee done and executed at\r\n  furthest in harveste nexte. Therefore yt is My commaundemente that\r\n  thow Corsus take order for the instant furnesshynge of shippes,\r\n  seamen, souldiers, horsemen, officiers, and pertyculer personnes,\r\n  wepons, municions, and al other necessaries whych is thought to be\r\n  needfull for the armie and hoast whych shalbe levied for the sayd\r\n  entrepryse, for whyche this letter shalbe thy suffycyaunt warrant\r\n  under My hande. Given under My signeth of Ouroboros in My pallaice\r\n  of Carcie thys xxix daie of may, beynge the vij daie of My yeare II.\r\n\r\nThe King took wax and a taper from the great gold ink-stand, and sealed\r\nthe warrant with the ruby head of the worm Ouroboros, saying, “The\r\nruby, most comfortable to the heart, brain, vigour, and memory of man.\r\nSo, ’tis confirmed.”\r\n\r\nIn that instant, when the wax was yet soft of the King’s seal sealing\r\nthat commission for Corsus, one tapped gently at the chamber door. The\r\nKing bade enter, and there came the captain of his bodyguard and stood\r\nbefore the King, with word that one waited without, praying instant\r\naudience, “And showed me for a token, O my Lord the King, a bull’s head\r\nwith fiery nostrils graven in a black opal in the bezel of a ring,\r\nwhich I knew for the signet of my Lord Corsus that his lordship beareth\r\nalway on his left thumb. And ’twas this, O King, that only persuaded\r\nme to deliver the message unto your Majesty in this unseasonable hour.\r\nWhich if it be a fault in me, I do humbly hope your Majesty will\r\npardon.”\r\n\r\n“Knowest thou the man?” said the King.\r\n\r\nHe answered, “I might not know him, dread Lord, for the mask and great\r\nhooded cloak he weareth. It is a little man, and speaketh a husky\r\nwhisper.”\r\n\r\n“Admit him,” said King Gorice; and when Sriva was come in, masked and\r\nhooded and holding forth the ring, he said, “Thou lookest questionable,\r\nalbeit this token opened a way for thee. Put off these trappings and\r\nlet me know thee.”\r\n\r\nBut she, speaking still in a husky whisper, prayed that they might be\r\nprivate ere she disclosed herself. So the King bade leave them private.\r\n\r\n“Dread Lord,” said the soldier, “is it your will that I stand ready\r\nwithout the door?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the King. “Void the ante-chamber, set the guard, and let\r\nnone disturb me.” And to Sriva he said, “If thine errand prove not more\r\nhonester than thy looks, this is an ill night’s journey for thee. At\r\nthe lifting of my finger I am able to metamorphose thee to a mandrake.\r\nIf indeed thou beest aught else already.”\r\n\r\nWhen they were alone the Lady Sriva doffed her mask and put back her\r\nhood, uncovering her head that was crowned with two heavy trammels of\r\nher dark brown hair bound up and interwoven above her brow and ears\r\nand pinned with silver pins headed with garnets coloured like burning\r\ncoals. The King beheld her from under the great shadow of his brows,\r\ndarkly, not by so much as the moving of an eyelid or a lineament of his\r\nlean visage betraying aught that passed in his mind at this disclosing.\r\n\r\nShe trembled and said, “O my Lord the King, I hope you will indulge\r\nand pardon in me this trespass. Truly I marvel at mine own boldness how\r\nI durst come to you.”\r\n\r\nWith a gesture of his hand the King bade her be seated in a chair on\r\nhis right beside the table. “Thou needest not be afraid, madam,” he\r\nsaid. “That I admit thee, let it make thee assured of welcome. Let me\r\nknow thine errand.”\r\n\r\nThe fire of her father’s wine shuddered down within her like a low-lit\r\nflame in a gust of wind as she sat there alone with King Gorice XII.\r\nin the circle of the lamplight. She took a deep breath to still her\r\nheart’s fluttering and said, “O King, I was much afeared to come, and\r\nit was to ask you a boon: a little thing for you to give, Lord, and yet\r\nto me that am the least of your handmaids a great thing to receive. But\r\nnow I am come indeed, I durst not ask it.”\r\n\r\nThe glitter of his eyes looking out from their eaves of darkness\r\ndismayed her; and little comfort had she of the iron crown at his\r\nelbow, bright with gems and fierce with uplifted claws, or of the\r\ncopper serpents interlaced that made the arms of his chair, or of the\r\nbright image of the lamp reflected in the table top where were red\r\nstreaks like streaks of blood and black streaks like edges of swords\r\nstreaking the green shining surface of the stone.\r\n\r\nYet she took heart to say, “Were I a great lord had done your majesty\r\nservice as my father hath, or these others you did honour to-night,\r\nO King, it had been otherwise.” He said nothing, and still gathering\r\ncourage she said, “I too would serve you, O King. And I came to ask you\r\nhow.”\r\n\r\nThe King smiled. “I am much beholden to thee, madam. Do as thou hast\r\ndone, and thou shalt please me well. Feast and be merry, and charge not\r\nthine head with these midnight questionings, lest too much carefulness\r\nmake thee grow lean.”\r\n\r\n“Grow I so, O King? You shall judge.” So speaking the Lady Sriva\r\nrose up and stood before him in the lamplight. Slowly she opened her\r\narms upwards right and left, putting back her velvet cloak from her\r\nshoulders, until the dark cloak hanging in folds from either uplifted\r\nhand was like the wings of a bird lifted up for flight. Dazzling fair\r\nshone her bare shoulders and bare arms and throat and bosom. One great\r\nhyacinth stone, hanging by a gold chain about her neck, rested above\r\nthe hollow of her breasts. It flashed and slept with her breathing’s\r\nalternate fall and swell.\r\n\r\n“You did threaten me, Lord, but now,” she said, “to transmew me to a\r\nmandrake. Would you might change me to a man.”\r\n\r\nShe could read nothing in the crag-like darkness of his countenance,\r\nthe iron lip, the eyes that were like pulsing firelight out of hollow\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\n“I should serve you better so, Lord, than my poor beauty may. Were I a\r\nman, I had come to you to-night and said, ‘O King, let us not suffer\r\nany longer of that hound Juss. Give me a sword, O King, and I will put\r\ndown Demonland for you and tread them under feet.’”\r\n\r\nShe sank softly into her chair again, suffering her velvet cloak to\r\nfall over its back. The King ran his finger thoughtfully along the\r\nupstanding claws of the crown beside him on the table.\r\n\r\n“Is this the boon thou askest me?” he said at length. “An expedition to\r\nDemonland?”\r\n\r\nShe answered it was.\r\n\r\n“Must they sail to-night?” said the King, still watching her. She\r\nsmiled foolishly.\r\n\r\n“Only,” he said, “I would know what gadfly of urgency stung thee on to\r\ncome so strangely and suddenly and after midnight.”\r\n\r\nShe paused a minute, then summoning courage: “Lest another should\r\nfirst come to you, O King,” she answered. “Believe me, I know of\r\npreparations, and one that shall come to you in the morning praying\r\nthis thing for another. What intelligence soever some hath, I am sure\r\nof that to be true that I have.”\r\n\r\n“Another?” said the King.\r\n\r\nSriva answered, “Lord, I’ll say no names. But there be some, O King, be\r\ndangerous sweet suppliants, hanging their hopes belike on other strings\r\nthan we may tune.”\r\n\r\nShe had bent her head above the polished table, looking curiously down\r\ninto its depths. Her corsage and gown of scarlet silk brocade were like\r\nthe chalice of a great flower; her white arms and shoulders like the\r\npetals of the flower above it. At length she looked up.\r\n\r\n“Thou smilest, my Lady Sriva,” said the King.\r\n\r\n“I smiled at mine own thought,” she said. “You’ll laugh to hear it, O\r\nmy Lord the King, being so different from what we spoke on. But sure,\r\nof women’s thoughts is no more surety nor rest than is in a vane that\r\nturneth at all winds.”\r\n\r\n“Let me hear it,” said the King, bending forward, his lean hairy hand\r\nflung idly across the table’s edge.\r\n\r\n“Why thus it was, Lord,” said she. “There came me in mind of a sudden\r\nthat saying of the Lady Prezmyra when first she was wed to Corund and\r\ndwelt here in Carcë. She said all the right part of her body was of\r\nWitchland but the left Pixy. Whereupon our people that were by rejoiced\r\nmuch that she had given the right part of her body to Witchland.\r\nWhereupon she said, but her heart was on the left side.”\r\n\r\n“And where wearest thou thine?” asked the King. She durst not look at\r\nhim, and so saw not the comic light go like summer lightning across his\r\ndark countenance as she spoke Prezmyra’s name.\r\n\r\nHis hand had dropped from the table edge; Sriva felt it touch her knee.\r\nShe trembled like a full sail that suddenly for an instant the wind\r\nleaves. Very still she sat, saying in a low voice, “There’s a word, my\r\nLord the King, if you’d but speak it, should beam a light to show you\r\nmine answer.”\r\n\r\nBut he leaned closer, saying, “Dost think I’ll chaffer with thee? I’ll\r\nknow the answer first i’ the dark.”\r\n\r\n“Lord,” she whispered, “I would not have come to you in this deep and\r\ndead time of the night but that I knew you noble and the great King,\r\nand no amorous surfeiter that should deal falsely with me.”\r\n\r\nHer body breathed spices: soft warm scents to make the senses reel:\r\nperfume of malabathrum bruised in wine, essences of sulphur-coloured\r\nlilies planted in Aphrodite’s garden. The King drew her to him. She\r\ncast her arms about his neck, saying close to his ear, “Lord, I may\r\nnot sleep till you tell me they must sail, and Corsus must be their\r\ncaptain.”\r\n\r\nThe King held her gathered up like a child in his embrace. He kissed\r\nher on the mouth, a long deep kiss. Then he sprang to his feet, set\r\nher down like a doll before him upon the table by the lamp, and so sat\r\nback in his own chair again and sat regarding her with a strange and\r\ndisturbing smile.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden his brow darkened, and thrusting his face towards hers, his\r\nthick black square-cut beard jutting beneath the curl of his shaven\r\nupper lip, “Girl,” he said, “who sent thee o’ this errand?”\r\n\r\nHe rolled his eye upon her with such a gorgon look that her blood ran\r\nback with a great leap towards her heart, and she answered, scarce to\r\nbe heard, “Truly, O King, my father sent me.”\r\n\r\n“Was he drunk when he sent thee?” asked the King.\r\n\r\n“Truly, Lord, I think he was,” said she.\r\n\r\n“That cup that he was drunken withal,” said King Gorice, “let him prize\r\nand cherish it all his life natural. For if in his sober senses he\r\nshould make no more estimation of me than think to bribe my favours\r\nwith a bona roba; by my soul, in his evil health he had sought to do\r\nit, for it should cost him nothing but his life.”\r\n\r\nSriva began to weep, saying, “O King, your gentle pardon.”\r\n\r\nBut the King paced the room like a prowling lion. “Did he fear I should\r\nsupply Corund in his place?” said he. “This was a cocksure way to make\r\nme do it, if indeed his practice had might to move me at all. Let him\r\nlearn to come to me with his own mouth if he hope to get good of me.\r\nOther else, out of Carcë let him go and avoid my sight, that all the\r\ngreat masters of Hell may conduct him thither.”\r\n\r\nThe King paused at length beside Sriva, that was perched still upon the\r\ntable, showing a kind of sweetness in tears, sobbing very pitifully,\r\nher face hidden in her two hands. So for a time he beheld her, then\r\nlifted her down, and while he sat in his great chair, holding her on\r\nhis knee with one hand, with the other drew hers gently from before\r\nher face. “Come,” he said, “I blame it not on thee. Give over all thy\r\nweeping. Reach me that writing from the table.”\r\n\r\nShe turned in his arms and stretched a hand out for the parchment.\r\n\r\n“Thou knowest my signet?” said the King.\r\n\r\nShe nodded, ay.\r\n\r\n“Read,” said he, letting her go. She stood by the lamp, and read.\r\n\r\nThe King was behind her. He took her beneath the arms, bending to speak\r\nhot-breathed in her ear. “Thou seest, I had already chose my general.\r\nTherefore I let thee know it, because I mean not to let thee go till\r\nmorning; and I would not have thee think thy loveliness, howe’er it\r\nplease me, moveth such deep-commanding spells as to sway my policy.”\r\n\r\nShe lay back against his breast, limp and strengthless, while he\r\nkissed her neck and eyes and throat; then her lips met his in a long\r\nvoluptuous kiss. Surely the King’s hands upon her were like live coals.\r\n\r\nBethinking her of Corinius, fuming at an open door and an empty\r\nchamber, the Lady Sriva was yet content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   XVII: THE KING FLIES HIS HAGGARD\r\n\r\n  HOW THE LADY PREZMYRA CAME TO THE KING ON AN ERRAND OF STATE, AND\r\n      HOW SHE PROSPERED THEREIN: WHEREIN IS ALSO SEEN WHY THE KING\r\n      WOULD SEND THE DUKE CORSUS INTO DEMONLAND; AND HOW ON THE\r\n      FIFTEENTH DAY OF JULY THESE LORDS, CORSUS, LAXUS, GRO, AND\r\n      GALLANDUS, SAILED WITH A FLEET FROM TENEMOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morn came the Lady Prezmyra to pray audience of the King, and\r\nbeing admitted to his private chamber stood before him in great beauty\r\nand splendour, saying, “Lord, I came to thank you as occasion served\r\nnot for me fitly so to do last night i’ the banquet hall. Sure, ’tis\r\nno easy task, since when I thank you as I would, I must seem too\r\nunmindful of Corund’s deserving who hath won this kingdom: but if I\r\nspeak too large of that, I shall seem to minish your bounty, O King.\r\nAnd ingratitude is a vice abhorred.”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” said the King, “thou needest not to thank me. And to mine ears\r\ngreat deeds have their own trumpets.”\r\n\r\nSo now she told him of her letters received from Corund out of Impland.\r\n“It is well seen, Lord,” said she, “how in these days you do beat down\r\nall peoples under you, and do set up new tributary kings to add to your\r\ngreat praise in Carcë. O King, how long must this ill weed of Demonland\r\noffend us, going still untrodden under feet?”\r\n\r\nThe King answered her not a word. Only his lip showed a gleam of teeth,\r\nas of a tiger’s troubled at his meal.\r\n\r\nBut Prezmyra said with great hardiness, “Lord, be not angry with me.\r\nMethinks it is the part of a faithful servant honoured by his master to\r\nseek new service. And where lieth likelier service Corund should do\r\nyou than west over seas, to lead presently an army naval thither and\r\nmake an end of them, ere their greatness stand up again from the blow\r\nwherewith last May you did strike them?”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” said the King, “this charge is mine. I’ll tell thee when I\r\nneed thy counsel, which is not now.” And standing up as if to end the\r\nmatter, he said, “I do intend some sport to-day. They tell me thou hast\r\na falcon gentle towereth so well she passeth the best Corinius hath.\r\n’Tis clear calm weather. Wilt thou take her out to-day and show us the\r\nmounty at a heron?”\r\n\r\nShe answered, “Joyfully, O King. Yet I beseech you add this favour to\r\nall your former goodness, to hear me yet one word. Something persuades\r\nme you have already determined of this enterprise, and by your putting\r\nof me off I do fear your majesty meaneth not Corund shall undertake it\r\nbut some other.”\r\n\r\nDark and immovable as his own dark fortress facing the bright morning,\r\nGorice the King stood and beheld her. Sunshine streaming through the\r\neastern casement lighted red-gold smouldering splendours in the heavy\r\ncoils of that lady’s hair, and flew back in dazzling showers from the\r\ndiamonds fastened among those coils. After a space he said, “Suppose I\r\nam a gardener. I go not to the butterfly for counsel. Let her be glad\r\nthat there be rose-trees there and red stonecrops for her delight;\r\nwhich if any be lacking I’ll give her more for the asking, as I’ll give\r\nthee more masques and revels and all brave pleasures in Carcë. But war\r\nand policy is not for women.”\r\n\r\n“You have forgot, O King,” said the Lady Prezmyra, “Corund made me his\r\nambassador.” But seeing a blackness fall upon the King’s countenance\r\nshe said in haste, “But not in all, O King. I will be open as day to\r\nyou. The expedition he strongly urged, but not for himself the leading\r\non’t.”\r\n\r\nThe King looked evilly upon her. “I am glad to hear it,” he said. Then,\r\nhis brow clearing, “Know thou it for thy good, madam, order is ta’en\r\nfor this already. Ere winter-nights return again, Demonland shall be my\r\nfootstool. Therefore write to thy lord I gave him his wish beforehand.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra’s eyes danced triumph. “O the glad day!” she cried. “Mine\r\nalso, O King?”\r\n\r\n“If thine be his,” said the King.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said she, “you know mine outgallops it.”\r\n\r\n“Then school thine, madam,” said the King, “to run in harness. Why\r\nthink’st thou I sent Corund into Impland, but that I knew he had\r\nexcellent wit and noble courage to govern a great kingdom? Wouldst have\r\nme a wilful child snatch Impland from him like a sampler half stitched?”\r\n\r\nThen, taking leave of her with more gracious courtesy, “We shall look\r\nto see thee then, madam, o’ the third hour before noon,” he said, and\r\nsmote on a gong, summoning the captain of his guard. “Soldier,” he\r\nsaid, “conduct the Queen of Impland. And bid the Duke Corsus straight\r\nattend me.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe third hour before noon the Lord Gro met with Prezmyra in the gate\r\nof the inner court. She had a riding-habit of dark green tiffany and\r\na narrow ruff edged with margery-pearls. She said, “Thou comest with\r\nus, my lord? Surely I am beholden to thee. I know thou lovest not the\r\nsport, yet to save me from Corinius I must have thee. He plagueth me\r\nmuch this morning with strange courtesies; though why thus on a sudden\r\nI cannot tell.”\r\n\r\n“In this,” said Lord Gro, “as in greater matters, I am thy servant, O\r\nQueen. ’Tis yet time enough, though. This half hour the King will not\r\nbe ready. I left him closeted with Corsus, that setteth presently about\r\nhis arming against the Demons. Thou hast heard?”\r\n\r\n“Am I deaf,” said Prezmyra, “to a bell clangeth through all Carcë?”\r\n\r\n“Alas,” said Gro, “that we waked too long last night, and lay too long\r\nabed i’ the morning!”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra answered, “That did not I. And yet I’m angry with myself now\r\nthat I did not so.”\r\n\r\n“How? Thou sawest the King before the council?”\r\n\r\nShe bent her head for yes.\r\n\r\n“And he nay-said thee?”\r\n\r\n“With infinite patience,” said she, “but most irrevocably. My lord must\r\nhold by Impland till it be well broke to the saddle. And truly, when I\r\nthink on’t, there’s reason in that.”\r\n\r\nGro said, “Thou takest it, madam, with that clear brow of nobleness and\r\nreason I had looked for in thee.”\r\n\r\nShe laughed. “I have the main of my desire, if Demonland shall be put\r\ndown. Natheless, it maketh a great wonder the King picketh for this\r\nwork so rude a bludgeon when so many goodly blades lie ready to his\r\nhand. Behold but his armoury.”\r\n\r\nFor, standing in the gateway at the head of the steep descent to the\r\nriver, they beheld where the lords of Witchland were met beyond the\r\nbridge-gate to ride forth to the hawking. And Prezmyra said, “Is it not\r\nbrave, my Lord Gro, to dwell in Carcë? Is it not passing brave to be in\r\nCarcë, that lordeth it over all the earth?”\r\n\r\nNow came they down and by the bridge to the Way of Kings to meet with\r\nthem on the open mead on the left bank of Druima. Prezmyra said to\r\nLaxus that rode on a black gelding full of silver hairs, “I see thou\r\nhast thy goshawks forth to-day, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, madam,” said he. “There is not a stronger hawk than these. Withal\r\nthey are very fierce and crabbed, and I must keep them private lest\r\nthey slay all other sort.”\r\n\r\nSriva, that was by, put forth a hand to stroke them. “Truly,” she said,\r\n“I love them well, thy goshawks. They be stout and kingly.” And she\r\nlaughed and said, “Truly to-day I look not lower than on a King.”\r\n\r\n“Thou mayst look on me, then,” said Laxus, “albeit I bear not my crown\r\ni’ the field.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis therefore I’ll mark thee not,” said she.\r\n\r\nLaxus said to Prezmyra, “Wilt thou not praise my hawks, O Queen?”\r\n\r\n“I praise them,” answered she, “circumspectly. For methinks they fit\r\nthy temper better than mine. These be good hawks, my lord, for flying\r\nat the bush. I am for the high mountee.”\r\n\r\nHer step-son Heming, black-browed and sullen-eyed, laughed in his\r\nthroat, knowing she mocked and thought on Demonland.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Corinius, mounted on a great white liard like silver with\r\nblack ear-tips, mane, and tail, and all four feet black as coal, drew\r\nup to the Lady Sriva and spoke with her apart, saying secretly so that\r\nnone but she might hear, “Next time thou shalt not carry it so, but\r\nI will have thee when and where I would. Thou mayst gull the Devil\r\nwith thy perfidiousness, but not me a second time, thou lying cozening\r\nvixen.”\r\n\r\nShe answered softly, “Beastly man, I did perform the very article of\r\nmine oath, and left thee an open door last night. If thou didst look to\r\nfind me within, that were beyond aught I promised. And know for that\r\nI’ll seek a greater than thou, and a nicer to my liking: one less ready\r\nto swap each kitchen slut on the lips. I know thy practice, my lord,\r\nand thy conditions.”\r\n\r\nHis face flamed red. “Were that my custom, I’d now amend it. Thou art\r\nso true a runt of their same litter, they shall all be loathly to me as\r\nthou art loathly.”\r\n\r\n“Mew!” said she, “wittily spoke, i’ faith; and right in the manner of a\r\ncommon horse-boy. Which indeed thou art.”\r\n\r\nCorinius struck spurs into his horse so that it bounded aloft; then\r\ncried out and said to Prezmyra, “Incomparable lady, I shall show thee\r\nmy new horse, what rounds, what bounds, what stop he makes i’ the full\r\ncourse of the gallop galliard.” And therewith, trotting up to her, made\r\nhis horse fetch a close turn in a flying manner upon one foot, and so\r\naway, rising to a racking pace, an amble, and thence after some double\r\nturns returning at the gallop and coming to a full stop by Prezmyra.\r\n\r\n“’Tis very pretty, my lord,” said she. “Yet I would not be thy horse.”\r\n\r\n“So, madam?” he cried. “Thy reason?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” said she, “were I the most temperate, strongest, and of the\r\ngentlest nature i’ the world, of the heat of the ginger, most swift to\r\nall high curvets and caprioles, I’d fear my crest should fall i’ the\r\nend, tired with thy spur-galling.”\r\n\r\nWhereat the Lady Sriva fell a-laughing.\r\n\r\nNow came Gorice the King among them with his austringers and falconers\r\nand his huntsmen with setters and spaniels and great fierce boar-hounds\r\ndrawn in a string. He rode upon a black mare with eyes fire-red, so\r\ntall a tall man’s head scarce topped her withers. He wore a leather\r\ngauntlet on his right hand, on the wrist whereof an eagle sat, hooded\r\nand motionless, gripping with her claws. He said, “It is met. Corsus\r\ngoeth not with us: I fly him at higher game. His sons attend him,\r\nlosing not an hour in preparation for this journey. The rest, take\r\npleasure in the chase.”\r\n\r\nSo they praised the King, and rode forth with him eastaway. The Lady\r\nSriva whispered Corinius in the ear, “Enchantery, my lord, ruleth in\r\nCarcë, and this it must be bringeth it about that none may see nor\r\ntouch me ’twixt midnight hour and cock-crow save he that must be King\r\nin Demonland.”\r\n\r\nBut Corinius made as not to hear her, turning toward the Lady Prezmyra,\r\nthat turned thence toward Gro. Sriva laughed. Merry of heart she seemed\r\nthat day, eager as the small merlin sitting on her fist, and willing at\r\nevery turn to have speech with King Gorice. But the King heeded her not\r\nat all, and gave her not a look nor a word.\r\n\r\nSo rode they awhile, jesting and discoursing, toward the Pixyland\r\nborder, rousing herons by the way whereat none made better sport than\r\nPrezmyra’s falcons, flown from her fist at many hundred paces as the\r\nquarry rose, and mounting with it to the clouds in corkscrew flights,\r\nring upon ring, up and up till the fowl was but a speck in the upper\r\nsky, and her falcons two lesser specks beside it.\r\n\r\nBut when they were come to the higher ground and the scrub and\r\nunderwood, then the King whistled his eagle off his fist. She flew from\r\nhim as if she would never have turned head again, yet presently upon\r\nhis shout came in; then soaring aloft waited on above his head, till\r\nthe hounds started a wolf out of the brake. Thereon she swooped sudden\r\nas a thunderbolt; and the King lighted down and helped her with his\r\nhunting-knife; and so again, thrice and four times till four wolves\r\nwere slain. And that was the greatest sport.\r\n\r\nThe King made much of his eagle, giving her the last wolf’s lights and\r\nliver to gorge herself withal. And he gave her over to his falconer,\r\nand said, “Ride we now into the flats of Armany, for I will fly my\r\nhaggard: my haggard eagle caught this March in the hills of Largos.\r\nMany a good night’s rest hath she cost me, to wake her and man her and\r\nteach her to know my call and be obedient. I will fly her now at the\r\nbig black boar of Largos that afflicteth the farmers hereabout these\r\ntwo years past and bringeth them death and loss. So shall we see good\r\nsport, if she be not too coy and wild.”\r\n\r\nSo the King’s falconer brought the haggard and the King took her on\r\nhis fist. A black eagle she was, red-beaked and glorious to look on.\r\nHer jesses were of red leather with little silver varvels whereon the\r\ncrab of Witchland was engraved in small. Her hood was of red leather\r\ntasselled with silver. First she bated from the fist of the King,\r\nscreaming and flapping her wings, but soon was quiet. And the King rode\r\nforth, sending his great brindled hounds before him to put up the boar;\r\nand all his company followed after.\r\n\r\nIn no long time they roused the boar, that turned red-eyed and\r\nmoody-mad on the King’s hounds, and charged among them ripping up the\r\nforemost so that her bowels gushed out. The King unhooded his eagle and\r\nflew her off his fist. But she, wild and ungentle, fastened not upon\r\nthe boar but on a hound that held him by the ear. She fixed her cruel\r\nclaws in the hound’s neck and picked his eyes out ere a man might speak\r\ntwo curses on her.\r\n\r\nGro, that was by the King, muttered, “O, I like not that. ’Tis ominous.”\r\n\r\nBy then was the King ridden up, and thrust the boar through with his\r\nspear, piercing him above and a little behind the shoulder so that\r\nthe blade went through the heart of him and he sank down dying in his\r\nblood. Then the King smote his eagle in his wrath with the butt of his\r\nspear-shaft, but smote her lightly and with a glancing blow, and away\r\nshe flew and was lost to sight. And the King was angry, for all that\r\nthe boar was slain, for the loss of his hound and his haggard, and for\r\nher ill behaviour. So he bade his huntsmen skin the boar and bring home\r\nhis skin to be a trophy, and so turned homeward.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the King called to him the Lord Gro to ride forward a\r\nlittle with him and out of earshot of the rest. The King said to him,\r\n“Thou hast a discontented look. Is it that I send not Corund into\r\nDemonland to crown the work he began at Eshgrar Ogo? Thou babblest\r\nbesides of omens.”\r\n\r\nGro answered, “My Lord the King, pardon my fears. For omens, indeed\r\n’tis oft as the saw sayeth, ‘As the fool thinketh, so the bell\r\nclinketh.’ I spake in haste. Who shall weep Fate from her determined\r\npurpose? But since you did name Corund’s name——”\r\n\r\n“I named him,” said the King, “because I am still ringing in the ears\r\nwith women’s talk. Whereto also I doubt not thou art privy.”\r\n\r\n“Only so much,” answered he, “that this is my thought: he were our\r\nbest, O King.”\r\n\r\n“Haply so,” said the King. “But wouldst have me therefore hold my\r\nstroke in the air while occasion knocketh at the gate? I’ll tell thee,\r\nI am potent in art magical, but scarce may I stay time’s wing the while\r\nI fetch Corund out of Impland and pack him westaway.”\r\n\r\nGro held his peace. “Well,” said the King, “I will hear more from thee.”\r\n\r\n“Lord,” he answered, “I like not Corsus.”\r\n\r\nThe King gave him a frump to his face. Gro held his peace again awhile,\r\nbut seeing the King would have more, he said, “Since it likes your\r\nmajesty to demand my counsel, I will speak. You know, Lord, of all your\r\nmen in Carcë Corinius is least my friend, and if I back him you will\r\nbe little apt to think me moved by interest. In my clear judgement, if\r\nCorund be barred from this journey (as reason is, I freely embrace it,\r\nhe must bide in Impland, both to harvest there his victories and to\r\ndeny the road to Juss and Brandoch Daha if haply they return from the\r\nMoruna, and besides, time, as you most justly say, O King, calleth for\r\nspeedy action): if he be barred, you have no better than Corinius. A\r\ncomplete soldier, a tried captain, young, fierce, and resolute, and one\r\nthat sitteth not down again when once he standeth up till that his will\r\nbe accomplished. Send him to Demonland.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the King. “I will not send Corinius. Hast thou not seen\r\nhawks that be in their prime and full pride for beauty and goodness,\r\nbut must be tamed ere they be flown at the quarry? Such an one is he,\r\nand I will tame him with harshness and duress till I be certain of him.\r\nAlso I have sworn and told him, last year when in his drunkenness he\r\nbetrayed my counsel and o’erset all our plans, broke me from Pixyland\r\nand set my prisoners free, that Corund and Corsus and Laxus should\r\nbe preferred and advanced before him until by quiet service he shall\r\npurchase my good will again.”\r\n\r\n“Give then the glory to Corsus, but to Corinius the rude work on’t for\r\na tiring. Send him as Corsus’s secretary, and your work shall be better\r\nperformed, O King.”\r\n\r\nBut the King said, “No. Thou art a fool to think he would receive it,\r\nthat being in disgrace could not humble himself but look bigger than\r\nbefore. And certainly I will not ask him, and so give him the glory to\r\nrefuse it.”\r\n\r\n“My Lord the King,” said Gro, “when I said unto you, I like not Corsus,\r\nyou did scoff. Yet ’tis no simple niceness made me say it, but because\r\nI do fear he shall prove a false cloth: he will shrink in the wetting\r\nand can abide no trial.”\r\n\r\n“By the blight of Sathanas,” said the King, “what crazy talk is this?\r\nHast forgot the Ghouls twelve years ago? True, thou wast not here. And\r\nyet, what skills it? When the fame hath gone back and forth through all\r\nthe world of their great spill when Witchland stood i’ the greatest\r\nstrait that ever she stood, and more than any other Corsus was to\r\npraise for our delivering. And since then, five years later, when he\r\nheld Harquem against Goldry Bluszco, and made him at last to give over\r\nthe siege and go home most ingloriously, and else had all the Sibrion\r\ncoast been the Demons’ appanage not ours.”\r\n\r\nGro bowed his head, having nought to say. The King was silent awhile,\r\nthen bared his teeth. “When I would burn mine enemy’s house,” he said,\r\n“I choose me a good brand, full of pitch and rosin, apt to sputter well\r\ni’ the fire and fry them. Such an one is Corsus, since he fared to\r\nGoblinland ten years ago, on that ill faring which, had I been King, I\r\nnever had agreed to; when Brandoch Daha took him prisoner on Lormeron\r\nfield and despitefully used him, stripped him stark naked, shaved him\r\nall of one side smooth as a tennis ball and painted him yellow and sent\r\nhim home with mickle shame to Witchland. Hell devour me, but I think\r\nhis heart is in this enterprise. I think thou’lt see brave doings in\r\nDemonland when he comes thither.”\r\n\r\nStill Gro was silent, and the King said after awhile, “I have given\r\nthee reasons enow, I think, why I send Corsus into Demonland. There\r\nis yet this other, that by itself weigheth not one doit, yet with the\r\nothers beareth down the balance if more thou lookest for. Unto mine\r\nother servants great tasks have I given, and great rewards: to Corund\r\nImpland and a king’s crown therefor, to Laxus the like in Pixyland,\r\nto thee by anticipation Goblinland, for so I do intend. But this old\r\nhunting-dog of mine sitteth yet in’s kennel with ne’er a bone to busy\r\nhis teeth withal. That is not well, and shall no longer be neither,\r\nsince there’s no reason for’t.”\r\n\r\n“Lord,” said Gro, “in all argument and wise prevision you have quite\r\no’erset me. Yet my heart misgives me. You would ride to Galing. You\r\nhave ta’en an horse therefor with never a star in’s forehead. Instead,\r\nI see there is a cloud in’s face; and such prove commonly furious,\r\ndogged, full of mischief and misfortune.”\r\n\r\nThey came down now upon the Way of Kings. Westward before them lay the\r\nmarshes, with the great bulk of Carcë eight or ten miles distant their\r\nchiefest landmark, and the towers of Tenemos breaking the level horizon\r\nline beyond it. The King, after a long silence, looked down on Gro. His\r\nlean rugged countenance was outlined darkly against the sky, terrible\r\nand proud. “Thou too,” said he, “shalt be in this faring to Demonland.\r\nLaxus shall have sway afloat, since that is his element of water.\r\nGallandus shall be secretary to Corsus, and thou shalt be with them\r\nin their counsels. But the main command, as I have decreed, lieth in\r\nCorsus. I’ll not crop his authority, no, not by an hair’s breadth. Sith\r\nJuss hath called the main, I will go hazard with Corsus. If I throw out\r\nwith him, Hell rot him for a false die. But ’tis not such a cast shall\r\ncast away all my fortune. I have a langret in my purse shall cross-bite\r\nfor me i’ the end and win me all, howsoe’er the Demons cog against me.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nSo ended that day’s sporting. And that day, and the next, and near\r\na month thereafter was the Duke Corsus busied up and down the land\r\npreparing his great armament. And on the fifteenth day of July was the\r\nfleet busked and boun in Tenemos Roads, and that great army of five\r\nthousand men-at-arms, with horses and all instruments of war, marched\r\nfrom their camp without Carcë down to the sea.\r\n\r\nFirst of them went Laxus with his guard of mariners, he wearing the\r\ncrown of Pixyland and they loudly acclaiming him as king and Gorice\r\nof Witchland as his over-lord. A gallant man he seemed, ready-looking\r\nand hard, well-armed, with open countenance and bright seaman’s eyes,\r\nand brown, crisp, curly beard and hair. Next came the main foot army\r\nheavy-armed with axe and spear and the short Witchland hanger, yeomen\r\nand farmers from the low lands about Carcë or from the southern\r\nvineyards or the hill country against Pixyland: burly swashing fellows,\r\nrough as bears, hardy as wild oxen, agile as an ape; four thousand\r\nfighting men chose out by Corsus up and down the land as best for this\r\ngreat conquest. The sons of Corsus, Dekalajus and Gorius, rode abreast\r\nbefore them with twenty pipers piping a battle song. Surely the tramp\r\nof that great army on the paven way was like the tramp of Fate moving\r\nfrom the east. Gorice the King, sitting in state on the battlements\r\nabove the water-gate, sniffed with his nostrils as a lion at the scent\r\nof blood. It was early morn, and the wind hung southerly, and the great\r\nbanners, blue and green and purple and gold, each with an iron crab\r\ndisplayed above it, flaunted in the sun.\r\n\r\nNow came four or five companies of horse, four hundred or more in all,\r\nwith brazen armour and bucklers and glancing spears; and last of all,\r\nCorsus himself with his picked legion of five hundred veterans to bring\r\nup the rear, fierce soldiers of the coast-lands that followed him of\r\nold to the eastern main and Goblinland, and had stood beside him in\r\nthe great days when he smote the Ghouls in Witchland. On Corsus’s\r\nleft and right, a little behind him, rode Gro and Gallandus. Ruddy of\r\ncountenance was Gallandus, gay of carriage and likely-looking, long of\r\nlimb, with long brown moustachios and large kind eyes like a dog.\r\n\r\nPrezmyra stood beside the King, and with her the ladies Zenambria and\r\nSriva, watching the long column marching toward the sea. Heming the\r\nson of Corund leaned on the battlements. Behind him stood Corinius,\r\nscornful-lipped, with folded arms, most glorious in holiday attire, a\r\nwreath of dwale about his brows, and wearing on his mighty breast the\r\ngold badge of the King’s captain general in Carcë.\r\n\r\nCorsus, as he rode by beneath them, planted on the point of his sword\r\nhis great helm of bronze plumed with green-dyed estridge-plumes and\r\nraised it high above his head in homage to the King. The sparse gray\r\nlocks of his hair lifted in the breeze, and pride flamed on the heavy\r\nface of him like a November sunset. He rode a dark bay, heavily built\r\nlike a bear, that stepped ponderously as weighed down by his rider’s\r\nbulk and the great weight of gear and battle-harness. His veterans\r\nmarching at his heel lifted their helms on spear and sword and bill,\r\nsinging their old marching song in time to the clank of their mailed\r\nfeet marching down the Way of Kings:\r\n\r\n    When Corsus dwelt at Tenemos,\r\n    Beside the sea in Tenemos,\r\n          _Tirra lirra lay_,\r\n    The Gowles came downe to Tenemos,\r\n    They brent his house in Tenemos,\r\n          _Downe derie downe day_.\r\n    But Corsus carved the Gowls\r\n        The coarsest meat\r\n        They ere did ete,\r\n    He made him garters with their bowels.\r\n    When hee came home to Tenemos,\r\n    Came home agayn to Tenemos,\r\n          _With a roundelaye_.\r\n\r\nThe King held aloft his staff-royal, returning Corsus his salute, and\r\nall Carcë shouted from the walls.\r\n\r\nIn such wise rode the Lord Corsus down to the ships with his great army\r\nthat should bring bale and woe to Demonland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               XVIII: THE MURTHER OF GALLANDUS BY CORSUS\r\n\r\n  OF THE UPRISING OF THE WARS OF KING GORICE XII. IN DEMONLAND;\r\n      WHEREIN IS SEEN HOW IN AN OLD MAN OF WAR STIFFNECKEDNESS AND\r\n      TYRANNY MAY OVERLIVE GOOD GENERALSHIP, AND HOW A GREAT KING’S\r\n      DISPLEASURE DURETH ONLY SO LONG AS IT AGREETH WITH HIS POLICY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNought befell to tell of after the sailing of the fleet from Tenemos\r\ntill August was nigh spent. Then came a ship of Witchland from the west\r\nand sailed up the river to Carcë and moored by the water-gate. Her\r\nskipper went straight aland and up into the royal palace in Carcë and\r\nthe new banquet hall, whereas was King Gorice XII. eating and drinking\r\nwith his folk. And the skipper gave letters into the hand of the King.\r\n\r\nBy then was night fallen, and all the bright lights kindled in the\r\nhall. The feast was three parts done, and thralls poured forth unto the\r\nKing and unto them that sat at meat with him dark wines that crown the\r\nbanquet. And they set before the feasters sweetmeats wondrous fair:\r\nbulls and pigs and gryphons and other, made all of sugar paste, some\r\nwines and spigots in their bellies to draw at, and suckets of all sorts\r\ncut out of their bellies to taste of, every one with his silver fork.\r\nMirth and pleasure was that night in the great hall in Carcë; but now\r\nwere all fallen silent, looking on the King’s countenance while he read\r\nhis letters. But none might read the countenance of the King, that was\r\ninscrutable as the high blind walls of Carcë brooding on the fen. So\r\nin that waiting silence, sitting in his great high seat, he read his\r\nletters, which were sent by Corsus, and writ in manner following:\r\n\r\n“Renouned Kinge and moste highe Prince and Lorde, Goreiyse Twelft of\r\nWychlonde and of Daemounlonde and of all kingdomes the sonne dothe\r\nspread his bemes over, Corsus your servaunte dothe prosterate miself\r\nbefoare your Greateness, evene befoare the face of the erthe.

Drop me\r\nan emerald in it to spawn luck i’ the cup, and drink him fortune and\r\nwisdom in victory.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra, that had watched the King till now as a mother watches her\r\nchild in the crisis of a fever, rose up radiant in her seat, crying,\r\n“Victory!” And all they fell a-shouting and smiting on the boards till\r\nthe roof-beams shook with their great shouting, while the King drank\r\nfirst and passed on the cup that all might drink in turn.\r\n\r\nBut Gorice the King sat dark among them as a cliff of serpentine that\r\nfrowns above dancing surges of a springtide summer sea.\r\n\r\nWhen the women left the banquet hall the Lady Prezmyra came to the King\r\nand said, “Your brow is too dark, Lord, if indeed this news is all good\r\nthat lights your heart and mind from withinward.”\r\n\r\nThe King answered and said, “Madam, it is very good news. Yet remember\r\nthat hard it is to lift a full cup without spilling.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow was summer worn and harvest brought in, and on the twenty-seventh\r\nday after these tidings afore-writ came another ship of Witchland out\r\nof the west sailing over the teeming deep, and rowed on a full tide up\r\nDruima and through the Ergaspian Mere, and so anchored below Carcë an\r\nhour before supper time. That was a calm clear sunshine evening, and\r\nKing Gorice rode home from his hunting at that instant when the ship\r\nmade fast by the water-gate. And there was the Lord Gro aboard of her;\r\nand the face of him as he came up out of the ship and stood to greet\r\nthe King was the colour of quick-lime a-slaking.\r\n\r\nThe King looked narrowly at him, then greeting him with much outward\r\nshow of carelessness and pleasure made him go with him to the King’s\r\nown lodgings. There the King made Gro drink a great stoup of red wine,\r\nand said to him, “I am all of a muck sweat from the hunting. Go in with\r\nme to my baths and tell me all while I bathe me before supper. Princes\r\nof all men be in greatest danger, for that men dare not acquaint them\r\nwith their own peril. Thou look’st prodigious. Know that shouldst thou\r\nproclaim to me all my fleet and army in Demonland brought to sheer\r\ndestruction, that should not dull my stomach for the feast to-night.\r\nWitchland is not so poor I might not pay back such a loss thrice and\r\nfour times and yet have money in my purse.”\r\n\r\nSo speaking, the King was come with Gro into his great bath chamber,\r\nwalled and floored with green serpentine, with dolphins carved in the\r\nsame stone to belch water into the baths that were lined with white\r\nmarble and sunken in the floor, both wide and deep, the hot bath on\r\nthe left and the cold bath, many times greater, on the right as they\r\nentered the chamber. The King dismissed all his attendants, and made\r\nGro sit on a bench piled with cushions above the hot bath, and drink\r\nmore wine. And the King stripped off his jerkin of black cowhide and\r\nhis hose and his shirt of white Beshtrian wool and went down into the\r\nsteaming bath. Gro looked with wonder on the mighty limbs of Gorice the\r\nKing, so lean and yet so strong to behold, as if he were built all of\r\niron; and a great marvel it was how the King, when he had put off his\r\nraiment and royal apparel and went down stark naked into the bath, yet\r\nseemed to have put off not one whit of his kingliness and the majesty\r\nand dread which belonged to him.\r\n\r\nSo when he had plunged awhile in the swirling waters of the bath, and\r\nsoaped himself from head to foot and plunged again, the King lay back\r\nluxuriously in the water and said to Gro, “Tell me of Corsus and his\r\nsons, and of Laxus and Gallandus, and of all my men west over seas,\r\nas thou shouldest tell of those whose life or death in our conceit\r\nimporteth as much as that of a scarab fly. Speak and fear not, keeping\r\nnothing back nor glozing over nothing. Only that should make me\r\ndreadful to thee if thou shouldst practise to deceive me.”\r\n\r\nGro spake and said, “My Lord the King, you have letters, I think, from\r\nCorsus that have told you how we came to Demonland, and how we gat a\r\nvictory over Volle in the sea-fight, and landed at Grunda, and fought\r\ntwo battles against Vizz and overthrew him in the last, and he is dead.”\r\n\r\n“Didst thou see these letters?” asked the King.\r\n\r\nGro answered, “Ay.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a true tale they tell me?”\r\n\r\nGro answered, “Mainly true, O King, though somewhat now and then he\r\nwindeth truth to his turn, swelling overmuch his own achievement. As\r\nat Grunda, where he maketh too great the Demons’ army, that by a just\r\ncomputation were fewer than us, and the battle was not ours nor theirs,\r\nfor while our left held them by the sea they stormed our camp on the\r\nright. And well I think ’twas to enveagle us into country that should\r\nbe likelier to his purpose that Vizz fell back toward Owlswick in the\r\nnight. But as touching the battle of Crossby Outsikes Corsus braggeth\r\nnot too much. That was greatly fought and greatly devised by him, who\r\nalso slew Vizz with his own hands in the thick of the battle, and made\r\na great victory over them and scattered all their strength, coming upon\r\nthem at unawares and taking them upon advantage.”\r\n\r\nSo saying Gro stretched forth his delicate white fingers to the goblet\r\nat his side and drank. “And now, O King,” said he, leaning forward over\r\nhis knees and running his fingers through the black perfumed curls\r\nabove his ears, “I am to tell you the uprising of those discontents\r\nthat infected all our fortunes and confounded us all. Now came\r\nGallandus with some few men down from Breakingdale, leaving his main\r\nforce of fourteen hundred men or so to hold the Stile as was agreed\r\nupon aforetime. Now Gallandus had advertisement of Spitfire come out of\r\nthe west country where he was sojourning when we came into Demonland,\r\ndisporting himself in the mountains with hunting of the bears that do\r\nthere inhabit, but now come hot-foot eastward and agathering of men at\r\nGaling. And on Gallandus’s urgent asking, was held a council of war\r\nthree days after Crossby Outsikes, wherein Gallandus set forth his\r\ncounsel that we should fare north to Galing and disperse them.\r\n\r\n“All thought well of this counsel, save Corsus. But he took it mighty\r\nill, being stubborn set to carry out his predetermined purpose, which\r\nwas to follow up this victory of Crossby Outsikes by so many cruel\r\nmurthers, rapes, and burnings, up and down the country side in Upper\r\nand Lower Tivarandardale and down by Onwardlithe and the southern\r\nseaboard, as should show those vermin he was their master whom they did\r\nrequire, and the scourge in your hand, O King, that must scourge them\r\nto the bare bone.\r\n\r\n“To which Gallandus making answer that the preparations at Galing did\r\nargue something to be done and not afar off, and that ‘This were a\r\npretty matter, if Owlswick and Drepaby shall be able to enforce us cast\r\nour eyes over our shoulders while those before us’ (meaning in Galing)\r\n‘strike us in the brains’; Corsus answereth most unhandsomely, ‘I will\r\nnot satisfy myself with this intelligence until I find it more soundly\r\nseconded.’ Nor would he listen, but said that this was his mind, and\r\nall we should abide by it or an ill thing should else befall us: that\r\nthis south-eastern corner of the land being gained with great terror\r\nand cruelty the neck of the wars in Demonland should then be broken,\r\nand all the others whether in Galing or otherwhere could not choose\r\nbut die like dogs; that ’twas pure folly, because of the hardness and\r\nnaughty ways of the country, to set upon Galing; and that he would\r\nquickly show Gallandus he was lord there. So was the council broke up\r\nin great discontent. And Gallandus abode before Owlswick, which as thou\r\nknowest, O King, is a mighty strong place, seated on an arm of the land\r\nthat runneth out into the sea beside the harbour, and a paven way goeth\r\nthereto that is covered with the sea save at low tide of a spring-tide.\r\nAnd we drew great store of provisions thither against a siege if such\r\nshould befall us. But Corsus with his main forces went south about\r\nthe country, murthering and ravishing, on his way to the new house of\r\nGoldry Bluszco at Drepaby, giving out that from henceforth should folk\r\nspeak no more of Drepaby Mire and Drepaby Combust that the Ghouls did\r\nburn, but both should shortly be burnt alike as two cinders.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said the King, coming out of the bath, “and did he burn it so?”\r\n\r\nGro answered, “He did, O King.”\r\n\r\nThe King lifted his arms above his head and plunged head foremost into\r\nthe great cold swimming bath. Coming forth anon, he took a towel to\r\ndry himself, and holding an end of it in either hand came and stood by\r\nGro, the towel rushing back and forth behind his shoulders, and said,\r\n“Proceed, tell me more.”\r\n\r\n“Lord,” said Gro, “so it was that they in Owlswick gave up the place at\r\nlast unto Gallandus, and Corsus came back from the burning of Drepaby\r\nMire. All the folk in that part of Demonland had he brought to misery\r\nin her most sharp condition. But now was he to find by sour experience\r\nwhat that neglect had bred him when he went not north to Galing as\r\nGallandus had counselled him to do.\r\n\r\n“For now was word of Spitfire marching out from Galing with an hundred\r\nand ten score foot and two hundred and fifty horse. Upon which tidings\r\nwe placed ourselves in very warlike fashion and moved north to meet\r\nthem, and on the last morn of August fell in with their army in a place\r\ncalled the Rapes of Brima in the open parts of Lower Tivarandardale.\r\nAll we were blithe at heart, for we held them at an advantage both in\r\nnumbers (for we were more than three thousand four hundred fighting\r\nmen, whereof were four hundred a-horseback), and in the goodness of our\r\nfighting stead, being perched on the edge of a little valley looking\r\ndown on Spitfire and his folk. There we abode for a time, watching what\r\nhe would do, till Corsus grew weary of this and said, ‘We are more than\r\nthey. I will march north and then east across the head of the valley\r\nand so cut them off, that they escape not north again to Galing after\r\nthe battle when they are worsted by us.’\r\n\r\n“Now Gallandus nay-said this strongly, willing him to stand and abide\r\ntheir onset; for being mountaineers they must certainly choose at\r\nlength, if we kept quiet, to attack us up the slope, and that were\r\nmightily to our advantage. But Corsus, that still grew from day to day\r\nmore hard to deal with, would not hear him, and at last sticked not to\r\naccuse him before them all (which was most false) that he did practise\r\nto gain the command for himself, and had caused Corsus to be set upon\r\nto have him and his sons murthered as they went from his lodging the\r\nnight before.\r\n\r\n“And Corsus gave order for the march across their front as I have told\r\nit you, O King; which indeed was the counsel of a madman. For Spitfire,\r\nwhen he saw our column crossing the dale-head on his right, gave order\r\nfor the charge, took us i’ the flank, cut us in two, and in two hours\r\nhad our army smashed like an egg that is dropped from a watch-tower on\r\npavement of hard granite. Never saw I so evil a destruction wrought on\r\na great army. Hardly and in evil case we won back to Owlswick with but\r\nseventeen hundred men, and of them some hundreds wounded sore. And if\r\ntwo hundred fell o’ the other side, ’tis a wonder and past expectation,\r\nso great was Spitfire’s victory upon us at the Rapes of Brima. And now\r\nwas our woe worsened by fugitives coming from the north, telling how\r\nZigg had fallen upon the small force that was left to hold the Stile\r\nand clean o’erwhelmed them. So were we now shut up in Owlswick and\r\nclose besieged by Spitfire and his army, who but for the devilish folly\r\nof Corsus, had ne’er made head against us.\r\n\r\n“An ill night was that, O my Lord the King, in Owlswick by the sea.\r\nCorsus was drunk, and both his sons, guzzling down goblet upon goblet\r\nof the wine from Spitfire’s cellars in Owlswick. Till at last he was\r\nfallen spewing on the floor betwixt the tables, and Gallandus standing\r\namongst us all, galled to the quick after this shame and ruin of our\r\nfortunes, cried out and said, ‘Soldiers of Witchland, I am aweary of\r\nthis Corsus: a rioter, a lecher, a surfeiter, a brawler, a spiller of\r\narmies, our own not our enemies’, who must bring us all to hell and we\r\ntake not order to prevent him.’ And he said, ‘I will go home again to\r\nWitchland, and have no more share nor part in this shame.’ But all they\r\ncried, ‘To the devil with Corsus! Be thou our general.’”\r\n\r\nGro was silent a minute. “O King,” he said at last, “if so it be that\r\nthe malice of the Gods and mine unfortune have brought me to that\r\ncase that I am part guilty of that which came about, blame me not\r\novermuch. Little I thought any word of mine should help Corsus and\r\nthe going forward of his bad enterprise. When all they called still\r\nupon Gallandus, saying, ‘Ha, ha, Gallandus! weed out the weeds, lest\r\nthe best corn fester! Be thou our general,’ he took me aside to speak\r\nwith him; because he said he would take further judgement of me before\r\nhe would consent in so great a matter. And I, seeing deadly danger in\r\nthese disorders, and thinking that there only lay our safety if he\r\nshould have command who was both a soldier and whose mind was bent to\r\nhigh attempts and noble enterprises, did egg him forward to accept\r\nit. So that he, albeit unwilling, said yea to them at last. Which all\r\napplauded; and Corsus said nought against it, being too sleepy-sodden\r\nas we thought with drunkenness to speak or move.\r\n\r\n“So for that night we went to bed. But in the morn, O King, was a great\r\nclamour betimes in the main court in Owlswick. And I, running forth in\r\nmy shirt in the misty gray of dawn, beheld Corsus standing forth in\r\na gallery before Gallandus’s lodgings that were in an upper chamber.\r\nHe was naked to the waist, his hairy breast and arms to the armpits\r\nclotted and adrip with blood, and in his hands two bloody daggers. He\r\ncried in a great voice, ‘Treason in the camp, but I have scotched it.\r\nHe that will have Gallandus to his general, come up and I shall mix his\r\nblood with his and make them familiar.’”\r\n\r\nBy then had the King drawn on his silken hose, and a clean silken\r\nshirt, and was about lacing his black doublet trimmed with diamonds.\r\n“Thou tellest me,” said he, “two faults committed by Corsus. That\r\nfirst he lost me a battle and nigh half his men, and next did murther\r\nGallandus in a spleen against him when he would have amended this.”\r\n\r\n“Killing Gallandus in his sleep,” said Gro, “and sending him from the\r\nshade into the house of darkness.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the King, “there be two days in every month when whatever\r\nis begun will never reach completion. And I think it was on such a day\r\nhe did execute his purpose upon Gallandus.”\r\n\r\n“The whole camp,” said Lord Gro, “is up in a mutiny against him, being\r\nmarvellously offended at the murther of so worthy a man in arms. Yet\r\ndurst they not openly go against him; for his veterans guard his\r\nperson, and he hath let slice the guts out of some dozen or more that\r\nwere foremost in murmuring at him, so that the rest are afeared to\r\nmake open rebellion. I tell you, O King, your army of Demonland is\r\nin great danger and peril. Spitfire sitteth down before Owlswick in\r\nmickle strength, and there is no expectation that we shall hold out\r\nlong without supply of men. There is danger too lest Corsus do some\r\ndesperate act. I see not how, with so mutinous an army as his, he can\r\ndare to attempt anything at all. Yet hath he his ears filled with the\r\ncontinual sound of reputation, and the contempt which will be spread\r\nto the disgrace of him if he repair not soon his fault on the Rapes\r\nof Brima. It is thought that the Demons have no ships, and Laxus\r\ncommandeth the sea. Yet hard it is to make any going between betwixt\r\nthe fleet and Owlswick, and there be many goodly harbours and places\r\nfor building of ships in Demonland. If they can stop our relieving of\r\nCorsus, and prevent Laxus with a fleet at spring, may be we shall be\r\ndriven to a great calamity.”\r\n\r\n“How camest thou off?” said the King.\r\n\r\n“O King,” answered Lord Gro, “after this murther in Owlswick I did\r\ndaily fear a fig or a knife, so for mine own health and Witchland’s\r\ndevised all the ways I could to come away. And gat at last to the fleet\r\nby stealth and there took rede with Laxus, who is most hot upon Corsus\r\nfor this ill deed of his, whereby all our hopes may end in smoke, and\r\nprayed me come to you for him as for myself and for all true hearts\r\nof Witchland that do seek your greatness, O King, and not decay, that\r\nyou might send them succour ere all be shent. For surely in Corsus\r\nsome wild distraction hath overturned his old condition and spilt the\r\ngoodness you once did know in him. His luck hath gone from him, and he\r\nis now one that would fall on his back and break his nose. I pray you\r\nstrike, ere Fate strike first and strike us into the hazard.”\r\n\r\n“Tush!” said the King. “Do not lift me before I fall. ’Tis supper time.\r\nAttend me to the banquet.”\r\n\r\nBy now was Gorice the King in full festival attire, with his doublet\r\nof black tiffany slashed with black velvet and broidered o’er with\r\ndiamonds, black velvet hose cross-gartered with silver-spangled bands\r\nof silk, and a great black bear-skin mantle and collar of ponderous\r\ngold. The Iron crown was on his head. He took down from his chamber\r\nwall, as they went by, a sword hafted of blue steel with a pommel of\r\nbloodstone carved like a dead man’s skull. This he bare naked in his\r\nhand, and they came into the banquet hall.\r\n\r\nThey that were there rose to their feet in silence, gazing expectant on\r\nthe King where he stood between the pillars of the door with that sharp\r\nsword held on high, and the jewelled crab of Witchland ablaze above his\r\nbrow. But most they marked his eyes. Surely the light in the eyes of\r\nthe King under his beetle brows was like a light from the under-skies\r\nshed upward from the pit of hell.\r\n\r\nHe said no word, but with a gesture beckoned Corinius. Corinius\r\nstood up and came to the King, slowly, as a night-walker, obedient to\r\nthat dread gaze. His cloak of sky-blue silk was flung back from his\r\nshoulders. His chest, broad as a bull’s, swelled beneath the shining\r\nsilver scales of his byrny, that was short-sleeved, leaving his strong\r\narms bare to view with golden rings about the wrists. Proudly he stood\r\nbefore the King, his head firm planted above his mighty throat and\r\nneck; his proud luxurious mouth, made for wine-cups and for ladies’\r\nlips, firm set above the square shaven chin and jaw; the thick fair\r\ncurls of his hair bound with black bryony; the insolence that dwelt in\r\nhis dark blue eyes tamed for the while in face of that green bale-light\r\nthat rose and fell in the steadfast gaze of the King.\r\n\r\nWhen they had so stood silent while men might count twenty breaths,\r\nthe King spake saying: “Corinius, receive the name of the kingdom of\r\nDemonland which thy Lord and King give thee, and make homage to me\r\nthereof.”\r\n\r\nThe breath of amazement went about the hall. Corinius kneeled. The\r\nKing gave him that sword which he held in his hand, bare for the\r\nslaughter, saying, “With this sword, O Corinius, shalt thou wear out\r\nthis blemish and blot that until now rested upon thee in mine eye.\r\nCorsus hath proved haggard. He hath made miss in Demonland. His sottish\r\nfolly hath shut him up in Owlswick and lost me half his force. His\r\njealousy, too maliciously and bloodily bent against my friends ’stead\r\nof mine enemies, hath lost me a good captain. The wonderful disorder\r\nand distresses of his army must, if thou amend it not, swing all our\r\nfortune at one chop from bliss to bale. If this be rightly handled by\r\nthee, one great stroke shall change every deal. Go thou, and prove thy\r\ndemerits.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Corinius stood up, holding the sword point-downward in his\r\nhand. His face flamed red as an autumn sky when leaden clouds break\r\napart on a sudden westward and the sun looks out between. “My Lord the\r\nKing,” said he, “give me where I may sit down: I will make where I may\r\nlie down. Ere another moon shall wax again to the full I will set forth\r\nfrom Tenemos. If I do not shortly remedy for you our fortunes which\r\nthis bloody fool hath laboured to ruinate, spit in my face, O King,\r\nwithhold from me the light of your countenance, and put spells upon me\r\nshall destroy and blast me for ever.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         XIX: THREMNIR’S HEUGH\r\n\r\n  OF THE LORD SPITFIRE’S BESIEGING OF THE WITCHES IN HIS OWN CASTLE\r\n      OF OWLSWICK; AND HOW HE DID BATTLE AGAINST CORINIUS UNDER\r\n      THREMNIR’S HEUGH, AND THE MEN OF WITCHLAND WON THE DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Spitfire sat in his pavilion before Owlswick in mickle discontent.\r\nA brazier of hot coals made a pleasant warmth within, and lights filled\r\nthe rich tent with splendour. From without came the noise of rain\r\nsteadily falling in the dark autumn night, splashing in the puddles,\r\npattering on the silken roof. Zigg sat by Spitfire on the bed, his\r\nhawk-like countenance shadowed with an unwonted look of care. His sword\r\nstood between his knees point downward on the floor. He tipped it\r\ngently with either hand now to the left now to the right, watching with\r\npensive gaze the warm light shift and gleam in the ball of balas ruby\r\nthat made the pommel of the sword.\r\n\r\n“Fell it out so accursedly?” said Spitfire. “All ten, thou saidst, on\r\nRammerick Strands?”\r\n\r\nZigg nodded assent.\r\n\r\n“Where was he that he saved them not?” said Spitfire. “O, it was vilely\r\nmiscarried!”\r\n\r\nZigg answered, “’Twas a swift and secret landing in the dark a mile\r\neast of the harbour. Thou must not blame him unheard.”\r\n\r\n“What more remain to us?” said Spitfire. “Content: I’ll hear him.\r\nWhat ships remain to us, is more to the purpose. Three by Northsands\r\nEres, below Elmerstead: five on Throwater: two by Lychness: two more\r\nat Aurwath: six by my direction on Stropardon Firth: seven here on the\r\nbeach.”\r\n\r\n“Besides four at the firth head in Westmark,” said Zigg. “And order is\r\nta’en for more in the Isles.”\r\n\r\n“Twenty and nine,” said Spitfire, “and those in the Isles beside. And\r\nnot one afloat, nor can be ere spring. If Laxus smell them out and take\r\nthem as lightly as these he burned under Volle’s nose on Rammerick\r\nStrands, we do but plough the desert building them.”\r\n\r\nHe rose to pace the tent. “Thou must raise me new forces for to break\r\ninto Owlswick. ’Fore heaven!” he said, “this vexes me to the guts, to\r\nsit at mine own gate full two months like a beggar, whiles Corsus and\r\nthose two cubs his sons drink themselves drunk within, and play at\r\ncock-shies with my treasures.”\r\n\r\n“O’ the wrong side of the wall,” said Zigg, “the master-builder may\r\njudge the excellence of his own building.”\r\n\r\nSpitfire stood by the brazier, spreading his strong hands above the\r\nglow. After a time he spake more soberly. “It is not these few ships\r\nburnt in the north should trouble me; and indeed Laxus hath not five\r\nhundred men to man his whole fleet withal. But he holdeth the sea,\r\nand ever since his putting out into the deep with thirty sail from\r\nLookinghaven I do expect fresh succours out of Witchland. ’Tis that\r\nmaketh me champ still on the bit till this hold be won again; for then\r\nwere we free at least to meet their landing. But ’twere most unfit at\r\nthis time of the year to carry on a siege in low and watery grounds,\r\nthe enemy’s army being on foot and unengaged. Wherefore, this is my\r\nmind, O my friend, that thou go with haste over the Stile and fetch me\r\nsupply of men. Leave force to ward our ships a-building, wheresoever\r\nthey be; and a good force in Krothering and thereabout, for I will not\r\nbe found a false steward of his lady sister’s safety. And in thine\r\nown house make sure. But these things being provided, shear up the\r\nwar-arrow and bring me out of the west fifteen or eighteen hundred\r\nmen-at-arms. For I do think that by me and thee and such a head of men\r\nof Demonland as we shall then command Owlswick gates may be brast open\r\nand Corsus plucked out of Owlswick like a whilk out of his shell.”\r\n\r\nZigg answered him, “I’ll be gone at point of day.”\r\n\r\nNow they rose up and took their weapons and muffled themselves in their\r\ngreat campaigning cloaks and went forth with torch-bearers to walk\r\nthrough the lines, as every night ere he went to rest it was Spitfire’s\r\nwont to do, visiting his captains and setting the guard. The rain fell\r\ngentlier. The night was without a star. The wet sands gleamed with the\r\nlights of Owlswick Castle, and from the castle came by fits the sound\r\nof feasting heard above the wash and moan of the sullen sleepless sea.\r\n\r\nWhen they had made all sure and were come nigh again to Spitfire’s tent\r\nand Zigg was upon saying good-night, there rose up out of the shadow\r\nof the tent an ancient man and came betwixt them into the glare of the\r\ntorches. Shrivelled and wrinkled and bowed he seemed as with extreme\r\nage. His hair and his beard hung down in elf-locks adrip with rain.\r\nHis mouth was toothless, his eyes like a dead fish’s eyes. He touched\r\nSpitfire’s cloak with his skinny hand, saying in a voice like the\r\nnight-raven’s, “Spitfire, beware of Thremnir’s Heugh.”\r\n\r\nSpitfire said, “What have we here? And which way the devil came he into\r\nmy camp?”\r\n\r\nBut that aged man still held him by the cloak, saying, “Spitfire, is\r\nnot this thine house of Owlswick? And is it not the most strong and\r\nfair place that ever man saw in this countree?”\r\n\r\n“Filth, unhand me,” said Spitfire, “else shall I presently thrust thee\r\nthrough with my sword, and send thee to the Tartarus of hell, where I\r\ndoubt not the devils there too long await thee.”\r\n\r\nBut that aged man said again, “Hot stirring heads are too easily\r\nentrapped. Hold fast, Spitfire, to that which is thine, and beware of\r\nThremnir’s Heugh.”\r\n\r\nNow was Lord Spitfire wood angry, and because the old carle still held\r\nhim by the cloak and would not let him go, plucked forth his sword,\r\nthinking to have stricken him about the head with the flat of his\r\nsword. But with that stroke went a gust of wind about them, so that\r\nthe torch-flames were nigh blown out. And that was strange, of a still\r\nwindless night. And in that gust was the old man vanished away like a\r\ncloud passing in the night.\r\n\r\nZigg spake: “The thin habit of spirits is beyond the force of weapons.”\r\n\r\n“Pish!” said Spitfire. “Was this a spirit? I hold it rather a\r\nsimulacrum or illusion prepared for us by Witchland’s cunning, to\r\ndarken our counsel and shake our resolution.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nOn the morrow while yet sunrise was red, Lord Zigg went down to the\r\nsea-shore to bathe in the great rock pools that face southward across\r\nthe little bay of Owlswick. The salt air was fresh after the rain. The\r\nwind that had veered to the east blew in cold and pinching gusts. In a\r\nrift between slate-blue clouds the low sun flamed blood-red. Far to the\r\nsouth-east where the waters of Micklefirth open on the main, the low\r\ncliffs of Lookinghaven-ness loomed shadowy as a bank of cloud.\r\n\r\nZigg laid down his sword and spear and looked south-east across the\r\nfirth; and behold, a ship in full sail rounding the ness and steering\r\nnorthward on the larboard tack. And when he had put off his kirtle he\r\nlooked again, and behold, two more ships a-steering round the ness and\r\nsailing hard in the wake of the first. So he donned his kirtle again\r\nand took his weapons, and by then were fifteen sail a-steering up the\r\nfirth in line ahead, dragons of war.\r\n\r\nSo he fared hastily to Spitfire’s tent, and found him yet abed,\r\nfor sweet sleep yet nursed in her bosom impetuous Spitfire; his\r\nhead was thrown back on the broidered pillow, displaying his strong\r\nshaven throat and chin; his fierce mouth beneath his bristling fair\r\nmoustachios was relaxed in slumber, and his fierce eyes closed in\r\nslumber beneath their yellow bristling eyebrows.\r\n\r\nZigg took him by the foot and waked him and told him all the matter:\r\n“Fifteen ships, and every ship (as I might plainly see as they drew\r\nnigh) as full of men as there be eggs in a herring’s roe. So cometh our\r\nexpectation to the birth.”\r\n\r\n“And so,” said Spitfire, leaping from the couch, “cometh Laxus again to\r\nDemonland, with fresh meat to glut our swords withal.”\r\n\r\nHe caught up his weapons and ran to a little knoll that stood above\r\nthe beach over against Owlswick Castle. And all the host ran to behold\r\nthose dragons of war sail up the firth at dawn of day.\r\n\r\n“They dowse sail,” said Spitfire, “and put in for Scaramsey. ’Tis not\r\nfor nothing I taught these Witchlanders on the Rapes of Brima. Laxus,\r\nsince he witnessed that downthrow of their army, now accounteth islands\r\nmore wholesomer than the mainland, well knowing we have nor sails nor\r\nwings to strike across the firth at him. Yet scarcely by skulking in\r\nthe islands shall he break up the siege of Owlswick.”\r\n\r\nZigg said, “I would know where be his fifteen other ships.”\r\n\r\n“In fifteen ships,” said Spitfire, “it is not possible he beareth more\r\nthan sixteen hundred or seventeen hundred men of war. Against so many I\r\nam strong enough to-day, should they adventure a landing, to throw ’em\r\ninto the sea and still contain Corsus if he make a sally. If more be\r\nadded, I am the less secure. Therefore occasion calleth but the louder\r\nfor thy purposed faring to the west.”\r\n\r\nSo the Lord Zigg called him out a dozen men-at-arms and went\r\na-horseback. By then were all the ships rowed ashore under the southern\r\nspit of Scaramsey, where is good anchorage for ships. They were there\r\nhidden from view, all save their masts that showed over the spit, so\r\nthat the Demons might observe nought of their disembarking.\r\n\r\nSpitfire rode with Zigg three miles or four, as far as the brow of\r\nthe descent to the fords of Ethreywater, and there bade him farewell.\r\n“Lightning shall be slow to my hasting,” said Zigg, “till I be back\r\nagain. Meantime, I would have thee be not too scornfully unmindful of\r\nthat old man.”\r\n\r\n“Chirking of sparrows!” said Spitfire. “I have forgot his brabble.”\r\nNevertheless his glance shifted southward beyond Owlswick to the great\r\nbluff of tree-hung precipice that stands like a sentinel above the\r\nmeadows of Lower Tivarandardale, leaving but a narrow way betwixt its\r\nlowest crags and the sea. He laughed: “O my friend, I am yet a boy in\r\nthine eyes it seemeth, albeit I am well-nigh twenty-nine years old.”\r\n\r\n“Laugh at me and thou wilt,” said Zigg. “Without this word said I could\r\nnot leave thee.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Spitfire, “to lull thy fears, I’ll not go a-birdsnesting\r\non Thremnir’s Heugh till thou come back again.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow for a week or more was nought to tell of save that Spitfire’s army\r\nsat before Owlswick, and they on the island sent ever and again three\r\nor four ships to land suddenly about Lookinghaven or at the head of\r\nthe firth, or southaway beyond Drepaby, as far as the coastlands under\r\nRimon Armon, harrying and burning. And as oft as force was gathered\r\nagainst them, they fared aboard again and sailed back to Scaramsey. In\r\nthose days came Volle from the west with an hundred men and joined him\r\nwith Spitfire.\r\n\r\nThe eighth day of November the weather worsened, and clouds gathered\r\nfrom the west and south, till all the sky was a welter of huge watery\r\nleaden clouds, separated one from another by oily streaks of white. The\r\nwind grew fitful as the day wore. The sea was dark like dull iron. Rain\r\nbegan to fall in big drops. The mountains showed monstrous and shadowy:\r\nsome dark inky blue, others in the west like walls and bastions of\r\nclotted mist against the hueless mist of heaven behind them. Evening\r\nclosed with thunder and rain and lightning-torn banks of vapour. All\r\nnight long the thunder roared in sullen intermission, and all night\r\nlong new banks of thunder-cloud swung together and parted and swung\r\ntogether again. And the light of the moon was abated, and no light seen\r\nsave the levin-brand, and the camp-fires before Owlswick, and the light\r\nof revelry within. So that the Demons camped before the castle were not\r\nware of those fifteen ships that put out from Scaramsey on that wild\r\nsea and landed two or three miles to the southward by the great bluff\r\nof Thremnir’s Heugh. Nor were they ware at all of them that landed\r\nfrom the ships: fifteen or sixteen hundred men-at-arms with Heming of\r\nWitchland and his young brother Cargo for their leaders. And the ships\r\nrowed back to Scaramsey through the loud storm and fury of the weather,\r\nall save one that foundered in Bothrey Sound.\r\n\r\nBut on the morn, when the tempest was abated, might all behold the\r\nputting forth of fourteen ships of war from Scaramsey, every ship of\r\nthem laden with men-at-arms. They had passage swiftly over the firth,\r\nand came aland two miles south of Owlswick. And the ships stood off\r\nagain from the land, but the army marshalled for battle on the meads\r\nabove Mingarn Hope.\r\n\r\nNow Lord Spitfire let draw up his men and moved out southward from the\r\nlines before Owlswick. When they were come within some half mile’s\r\ndistance of the Witchland army, so that they might see clearly their\r\nrusset kirtles and their shields and body-armour of bronze, and the\r\ndull glint of their sword-blades and the heads of their spears, Volle,\r\nthat rode by Spitfire, spake and said, “Markest thou him, O Spitfire,\r\nthat rideth back and forth before their battle, marshalling them? So\r\never rode Corinius; and well mayst thou know him even afar off by his\r\nshowiness and jaunting carriage. Yet see a great wonder now: for who\r\never heard tell of this young hotspur giving back from the fight? And\r\nnow, or ever we be gotten within spear-shot——”\r\n\r\n“By the bright eye of day,” cried Spitfire, “’tis so! Will he baulk me\r\nquite of a battle? I’ll loose a handful of horse upon them to delay\r\ntheir haste ere they be flown beyond sight and finding.”\r\n\r\nTherewith he gave command to his horsemen to ride forth upon the enemy.\r\nAnd they rode forth with Astar of Rettray, that was brother-in-law\r\nto Lord Zigg, for their leader. But the Witchland horse met them by\r\nthe shallows of Aron Pow and held them in the shallows while Corinius\r\nwith his main army won across the river. And when the main body of\r\nthe Demons were come up and the passage forced, the Witchlanders were\r\ngotten clean away across the water-meadows to the pass betwixt the\r\nshore and the steeps of Thremnir’s Heugh.\r\n\r\nThen said Spitfire, “They stay not to form even i’ the narrow way\r\n’twixt the sea and the Heugh. And that were their safety, if they had\r\nbut the heart to turn and stand us.” And he shouted with a great shout\r\nupon his men to charge the enemy, and suffer not a Witch to overlive\r\nthat slaughter.\r\n\r\nSo the footmen caught hold of the stirrup-leathers of the horsemen,\r\nand running and riding they poured into the narrow pass; and ever was\r\nSpitfire foremost among his men, hewing to left and to right among the\r\npress, riding on that whelming battle-tide that seemed to bear him on\r\nto triumph.\r\n\r\nBut now on a sudden was he, who with but twelve hundred men had so\r\nhotly followed fifteen hundred into the strait passage under Thremnir’s\r\nHeugh, made ware too late that he must have to do with three thousand:\r\nCorinius rallying his folk and turning like a wolf in the pass, while\r\nCorund’s sons, that had landed as aforesaid in the storm in the mirk\r\nof night, swept down with their battalions from the wooded slopes\r\nbehind the Heugh. In such wise that Spitfire wist not sooner of any\r\nforeshadowing of disaster than of disaster’s self: the thunder of the\r\nblow in flank and front and rear.\r\n\r\nThen befell great manslaying between the sea-cliffs and the sea. The\r\nDemons, taken at that advantage, were like a man tripped in mid-stride\r\nby a rope across the way. By the sore onset of the Witches they were\r\ndriven down into the shallows of the sea, and the spume of the sea\r\nwas red with blood. And the Lord Corinius, now that he had done with\r\nfeigned retreat, fared through the battle like a stream of unquenchable\r\nwildfire, that none might sustain his strokes that were about him.\r\n\r\nNow was Spitfire’s horse slain under him with a spear-thrust, as riding\r\nfetlock-deep in the yielding sand he rallied his men to fling back\r\nHeming. But Bremery of Shaws brought him another horse, and so mightily\r\nwent he forth against the Witches that the sons of Corund were fain to\r\ngive back before his onslaught, and that wing of the Witchland army was\r\npressed back against the broken ground below the Heugh. Yet was that\r\nof little avail, for Corinius brake through from the north, thrusting\r\nthe Demons with great slaughter back from the sea, so that they were\r\npenned betwixt him and Heming. Therewith Spitfire turned with some\r\npicked companies against Corinius; and well it seemed for awhile that\r\na great force of the Witches must be whelmed or drowned in the salt\r\nwaves. And Corinius himself stood now in great peril of his life, for\r\nhis horse was bogued in the soft sands and might not win free for all\r\nhis plunging.\r\n\r\nIn that nick of time came Spitfire through the stour, with a band of\r\nDemons about him, slaying as he came. He shouted with a terrible voice,\r\n“O Corinius, hateful to me and mine as are the gates of Hell, now will\r\nI kill thee, and thy dead carcase shall fatten the sweet meads of\r\nOwlswick.”\r\n\r\nCorinius answered him, “Bloody Spitfire, last of three whelps, for thy\r\nbrothers are by now dead and rotten, I shall give thee a choke-pear.”\r\n\r\nTherewith Spitfire shot a twirl-spear at him. It missed the man but\r\nsmote the great horse in the shoulder so that he plunged and fell in\r\na heap, hurt to the death. But the Lord Corinius lighting nimbly on\r\nhis feet caught Spitfire’s horse by the bridle rein and smote it on\r\nthe muzzle, even as he rode at him, so that the horse reared up and\r\nswerved. Spitfire made a great blow at him with an axe, but it came\r\nslantwise on the helmet ridge and glented aside in air. Then Corinius\r\nthrust up under Spitfire’s shield with his sword, and the point entered\r\nthe big muscle of the arm near the armpit, and glancing against the\r\nbone tore up through the muscles of the shoulder. And that was a great\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Spitfire slacked not from the fight, but smote at him\r\nagain, thinking to have hewn off his arm the hand whereof still\r\nclutched the bridle-rein. Corinius caught the axe on his shield, but\r\nhis fingers loosed the rein, and almost he fell to earth under that\r\nmighty stroke, and the good bronze shield was dented and battered in.\r\n\r\nNow with the loosing of the reins was Spitfire’s horse plunged forward,\r\ncarrying him past Corinius toward the sea. But he turned and hailed\r\nhim, crying, “Get thee an horse. For I count it unworthy to fight with\r\nthee bearing this advantage over thee, I a-horseback and thou on foot.”\r\n\r\nCorinius cried out and answered, “Come down from thine horse then, and\r\nmeet me foot to foot. And know it, my pretty throstle-cock, that I am\r\nking in Demonland, which dignity I hold of the King of Kings, Gorice of\r\nWitchland, mine only overlord. Meet it is that I show thee in combat\r\nsingular, that vauntest thyself greatest among the rebels yet left\r\nalive in this my kingdom, how much greater is my might than thine.”\r\n\r\n“These be great and thumping words,” said Spitfire. “I shall thrust\r\nthem down thy throat again.”\r\n\r\nTherewith he made as if to light down from his horse; but as he strove\r\nto light down, a mist went before his eyes and he reeled in his saddle.\r\nHis men rushed in betwixt him and Corinius, and the captain of his\r\nbodyguard bare him up, saying, “You are hurt, my lord. You must not\r\nfight no more with Corinius, for your highness is unmeet for fighting\r\nand may not stand alone.”\r\n\r\nSo they that were about him bare up great Spitfire. And the mellay that\r\nwas stayed while those lords dealt together in single combat brake\r\nforth afresh in that place. But all the while had furious war swung\r\nand ravened below Thremnir’s Heugh, and wondrous was the valour of the\r\nDemons; for many hundred were slain or wounded to the death, and but a\r\nsmall force were they that yet remained to bear up the battle against\r\nthe Witches.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow those that were with Spitfire departed with him in the secretest\r\nmanner that they could out of the fight, wrapping about him a\r\nwatchet-coloured cloak to hide his shining armour. They stanched the\r\nblood that ran from the great wound in his shoulder and bound it\r\nup carefully, and carried him a-horseback by Volle’s command into\r\nTremmerdale by secret mountain paths up to a desolate corrie east of\r\nSterry Gap, under the great scree-shoot that flanks the precipices of\r\nthe south summit of Dina. A long time he lay there senseless, like\r\nto one dead. For many hurts had he taken in the unequal fight, and\r\ngreatly was he bruised and battered, but worst of all was the sore hurt\r\nCorinius gave him ere they parted betwixt the limits of land and sea.\r\n\r\nAnd when night was fallen and all the ways were darkened, came the Lord\r\nVolle with a few companions utterly wearied to that lonely corrie. The\r\nnight was still and cloudless, and the maiden moon walked high heaven,\r\nblackening the shadows of the great peaks that were like sharks’ teeth\r\nagainst the night. Spitfire lay on a bed of ling and cloaks in the lee\r\nof a great boulder. Ghastly pale was his face in the silver moonlight.\r\n\r\nVolle leaned upon his spear looking earnestly upon him. They asked him\r\ntidings. And Volle answered, “All lost,” and still looked upon Spitfire.\r\n\r\nThey said, “My lord, we have stanched the blood and bound up the wound,\r\nbut his lordship abideth yet senseless. And greatly we fear for his\r\nlife, lest this great hurt yet prove his bane-sore.”\r\n\r\nVolle kneeled beside him on the cold sharp stones and tended him as\r\na mother might her sick child, applying to the wound leaves of black\r\nhorehound and millefoil and other healing simples, and giving him to\r\ndrink out of a flask of precious wine of Arshalmar, ripened for an\r\nage in the deep cellars below Krothering. So that in a while Spitfire\r\nopened his eyes and said, “Draw back the curtains of the bed, for ’tis\r\nmany a day since I woke up in Owlswick. Or is it night indeed? How went\r\nthe fight, then?”\r\n\r\nHis eyes stared at the naked rocks and the naked sky beyond them. Then\r\nwith a great groan he lifted himself on his right elbow. Volle put a\r\nstrong arm about him, saying, “Drink the good wine, and have patience.\r\nThere be great doings toward.”\r\n\r\nSpitfire stared round him awhile, then said violently, “Shall we be\r\nfoxes and fugitive men to dwell in holes o’ the hollow mountain side?\r\nSo the bright day is done, ha? Then off with these trammels.” And he\r\nfell a-tearing at the bandage on his wounds.\r\n\r\nBut Volle prevented him with strong hands, saying, “Bethink thee how on\r\nthee alone, O glorious Spitfire, and on thy wise heart and valiant soul\r\nthat delighteth in furious war, resteth all our hope to ward off from\r\nour lady wives and dear children and all our good land and fee the fury\r\nof the men of Witchland, and to save alive the great name of Demonland.\r\nLet not thy proud heart be capable of despair.”\r\n\r\nBut Spitfire groaned and said, “Certain it was that woe and evil hap\r\nmust be to Demonland until my kinsmen be gotten home again. And that\r\nday I think shall never dawn.” And he cried, “Boasted he not that he is\r\nking in Demonland? and yet I had not my sword in his umbles. And thou\r\nthinkest I’ll live in shame?”\r\n\r\nTherewithal he strove again to tear off the bandages, but Volle\r\nprevented him. And he raved and said, “Who was it forced me from the\r\nbattle? ’Tis pity of his life, to have abused me so. Better dead than\r\nrun from Corinius like a beaten puppy. Let me go, false traitors! I\r\nwill amend this. I will die fighting. Let me go back.”\r\n\r\nVolle said, “Lift up thine eyes, great Spitfire, and behold the lady\r\nmoon, how virgin free she walketh the wide fields of heaven, and the\r\nglory of the stars of heaven which in their multitudes attend her. And\r\nas little as earthly mists and storms do dim her, but though she be hid\r\nawhile yet when the tempest is abated and the sky swept bare of clouds\r\nthere she appeareth again in her steadfast course, mistress of tides\r\nand seasons and swayer of the fates of mortal men: even such is the\r\nglory of sea-girt Demonland, and the glory of thine house, O Spitfire.\r\nAnd as little as commotions in the heavens should avail to remove these\r\neverlasting mountains, so little availeth disastrous war, though it be\r\na great fight lost as was to-day, to shake down our greatness, that are\r\nmightiest with the spear from of old and able to make all earth bow to\r\nour glory.”\r\n\r\nSo said Volle. And the Lord Spitfire looked out across the mist-choked\r\nsleeping valley to the great rock-faces dim in the moonlight and the\r\nlean peaks grand and silent beneath the moon. He spake not, whether for\r\nstrengthlessness or as charmed to silence by the mighty influences of\r\nnight and the mountain solitudes and by Volle’s voice speaking deep and\r\nquiet in his ear, like the voice of night herself calming earth-born\r\ntumults and despairs.\r\n\r\nAfter a time Volle spake once more: “Thy brethren shall come home\r\nagain: doubt it not. But till then art thou our strength. Therefore\r\nhave patience; heal thy wounds; and raise forces again. But shouldst\r\nthou in desperate madness destroy thy life, then were we shent indeed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           XX: KING CORINIUS\r\n\r\n  OF THE ENTRY OF THE LORD CORINIUS INTO OWLSWICK AND HOW HE WAS\r\n      CROWNED IN SPITFIRE’S SAPPHIRE CHAIR AS VICEROY OF GORICE THE\r\n      KING AND KING IN DEMONLAND: AND HOW ALL THAT WERE IN OWLSWICK\r\n      CASTLE DID SO RECEIVE AND ACKNOWLEDGE HIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorinius, having completed this great victory, came with his army north\r\nagain to Owlswick as daylight began to fade. The drawbridge was let\r\ndown for him and the great gates flung wide, that were studded with\r\nsilver and ribbed with adamant; and in great pomp rode he and his into\r\nOwlswick Castle, over the causey builded of the living rock and great\r\nblocks of hewn granite out of Tremmerdale. The more part of his army\r\nlay in Spitfire’s camp before the castle, but a thousand were with him\r\nin his entry into Owlswick with Corund’s sons and the lords Gro and\r\nLaxus besides, for the fleet had put across to anchor there when they\r\nsaw the day was won.\r\n\r\nCorsus greeted them well, and would have brought them to their lodgings\r\nnear his own chamber, that they might put off their harness and don\r\nclean linen and festival garments before supper. But Corinius excused\r\nhimself, saying he had eat nought since breakfast-time: “Let us\r\ntherefore not pass for ceremony, but bring us I pray you forthright to\r\nthe banquet house.”\r\n\r\nCorinius went in with Corsus before them all, putting lovingly about\r\nhis shoulder his arm all befouled with dust and clotted blood. For he\r\nhad not so much as stayed for washing of his hands. And that was scarce\r\ngood for the broidered cloak of purple taffety the Duke Corsus wore\r\nabout his shoulders. Howbeit, Corsus made as if he marked it not.\r\n\r\nWhen they were come into the hall, Corsus looked about him and said,\r\n“So it is, my Lord Corinius, that this hall is something little for the\r\ngreat press that here befalleth. Many of mine own folk that be of some\r\naccount should by long custom sit down with us. And here be no seats\r\nleft for them. Prithee command some of the common sort that came in\r\nwith thee to give place, that all may be done orderly. Mine officers\r\nmust not scramble in the buttery.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry, my lord,” answered Corinius, “but needs must that we\r\nbethink us o’ these lads of mine which have chiefly borne the toil of\r\nbattle, and well I weet thou’lt not deny them this honour to sit at\r\nmeat with us: these that thou hast most to thank for opening Owlswick\r\ngates and raising the siege our enemies held so long against you.”\r\n\r\nSo they took their seats, and supper was set before them: kids stuffed\r\nwith walnuts and almonds and pistachios; herons in sauce cameline;\r\nchines of beef; geese and bustards; and great beakers and jars of\r\nruby-hearted wine. Right fain of the good banquet were Corinius and his\r\nfolk, and silence was in the hall for awhile save for the clatter of\r\ndishes and the champing of the mouths of the feasters.\r\n\r\nAt length Corinius, quaffing down at one draught a mighty goblet of\r\nwine, spake and said, “There was battle in the meads by Thremnir’s\r\nHeugh to-day, my lord Duke. Wast thou at that battle?”\r\n\r\nCorsus’s heavy cheeks flushed somewhat red. He answered, “Thou knowest\r\nI was not. And I should account it most blameable hotheadedness to have\r\nsallied forth when it seemed Spitfire had the victory.”\r\n\r\n“O my lord,” said Corinius, “think not I made this a quarrel to thee.\r\nThe rather let me show thee how much I hold thee in honour.”\r\n\r\nTherewith he called his boy that stood behind his chair, and the boy\r\nreturned anon with a diadem of polished gold set all about with topazes\r\nthat had passed through the fire; and on the frontlet of that diadem\r\nwas the small figure of a crab-fish in dull iron, the eyes of it two\r\ngreen beryls on stalks of silver. The boy set it down on the table\r\nbefore the Lord Corinius, as it had been a dish of meat before him.\r\nCorinius took a writing from his purse, and laid it on the table for\r\nCorsus to see. And there was the signet upon it of the worm Ouroboros\r\nin scarlet wax, and the sign manual of Gorice the King.\r\n\r\n“My Lord Corsus,” said he, “and ye sons of Corsus, and ye other\r\nWitches, I do you to wit that our Lord the King made me by these tokens\r\nhis viceroy for his province of Demonland, and willed that I should\r\nbear a king’s name in this land and that under him all should render me\r\nobedience.”\r\n\r\nCorsus, looking on the crown and the royal warrant of the King, waxed\r\nin one instant deadly pale, and in the next red as blood.\r\n\r\nCorinius said, “To thee, O Corsus, out of all these great ones that\r\nhere be gathered together in Owlswick, will I submit me for thee to\r\ncrown me with this crown, as king in Demonland. This, that thou mayst\r\nsee and know how most I honour thee.”\r\n\r\nNow were all silent, waiting on Corsus to speak. But he spake not a\r\nword. Dekalajus said privily in his ear, “O my father, if the monkey\r\nreigns, dance before him. Time shall bring us occasion to right you.”\r\n\r\nAnd Corsus, disregarding not this wholesome rede, for all he might not\r\nwholly rule his countenance, yet ruled himself to bite in the injuries\r\nhe was fain to utter. And with no ill grace he did that office, to set\r\non Corinius’s head the new crown of Demonland.\r\n\r\nCorinius sat now in Spitfire’s seat, whence Corsus had moved to\r\nmake place for him: in Spitfire’s high seat of smoke-coloured jade,\r\ncuriously carved and set with velvet-lustred sapphires, and right and\r\nleft of him were two high candlesticks of fine gold. The breadth of\r\nhis shoulders filled all the space between the pillars of the spacious\r\nseat. A hard man he looked to deal with, clothed upon with youth and\r\nstrength and all armed and yet smoking from the battle.\r\n\r\nCorsus, sitting between his sons, said under his breath, “Rhubarb!\r\nbring me rhubarb to purge away this choler!”\r\n\r\nBut Dekalajus whispered him, “Softly, tread easy. Let not our counsels\r\nwalk in a net, thinking they are hidden. Nurse him to security, which\r\nshall be our safety and the mean to our wiping out this shaming. Was\r\nnot Gallandus as big a man?”\r\n\r\nCorsus’s dull eye gleamed. He lifted a brimming wine-cup to toast\r\nCorinius. And Corinius hailed him and said, “My lord Duke, call in\r\nthine officers I pray thee and proclaim me, that they in turn may\r\nproclaim me king unto all the army that is in Owlswick.”\r\n\r\nWhich Corsus did, albeit sore against his liking, knowing not where to\r\nfind a reason against it.\r\n\r\nWhen the plaudits were heard in the courts without, acclaiming him as\r\nking, Corinius spake again and said, “I and my folk be a-weary, my\r\nlord, and would betimes to our rest. Give order, I pray thee, that they\r\nmake ready my lodgings. And let them be those same lodgings Gallandus\r\nhad whenas he was in Owlswick.”\r\n\r\nWhereat Corsus might scarce forbear a start. But Corinius’s eye was on\r\nhim, and he gave the order.\r\n\r\nWhile he waited for his lodgings to be made ready, the Lord Corinius\r\nmade great good cheer, calling for more wine and fresh dainties to set\r\nbefore those lords of Witchland: olives, and botargoes, and conserves\r\nof goose’s liver richly seasoned, taken from Spitfire’s plenteous store.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Corsus spake softly to his sons: “I like not his naming\r\nof Gallandus. Yet seemeth he careless, as one that feareth no guile.”\r\n\r\nAnd Dekalajus answered in his ear, “Peradventure the Gods ordained his\r\ndestruction, to make him choose that chamber.”\r\n\r\nSo they laughed. And the banquet drew to a close with much pleasure and\r\nmerrymaking.\r\n\r\nNow came serving men with torches to light them to their chambers. As\r\nthey stood up to bid good-night, Corinius said, “I’m sorry, my lord,\r\nif, after thy pleasant usage, I should do aught that is not convenable\r\nto thee. But I doubt not Owlswick Castle must be irksome to thee and\r\nthy sons, that were so long mewed up within it, and I doubt not ye are\r\nwearied by this siege and long warfare. Therefore it is my will that\r\nyou do instantly depart home to Witchland. Laxus hath a ship manned\r\nready to transport you thither. To put a fit and friendly term to our\r\nfestivities, we’ll bring you down to the ship.”\r\n\r\nCorsus’s jaw fell. Yet he schooled his tongue to say, “My lord, so as\r\nit shall please thee. Yet let me know thy reasons. Surely the swords\r\nof me and my sons avail not so little for Witchland in this country of\r\nour evil-willers that we should sheathe ’em and go home. Howbeit, ’tis\r\na matter demandeth no sweaty haste. We will take rede hereon in the\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\nBut Corinius answered him, “Cry you mercy, needful it is that this very\r\nnight you go ashipboard.” And he gave him an ill look, saying, “Sith\r\nI lie to-night in Gallandus’s lodgings, I think it fit my bodyguard\r\nshould have thy chamber, my lord Duke, which, as I lately learned,\r\nadjoineth it.”\r\n\r\nCorsus said no word. But Gorius, his younger son, that was drunk with\r\nwine, leaped up and said, “Corinius, in an evil hour art thou come into\r\nthis land to demand servitude of us. And thou art informed of my father\r\nright maliciously if thou art afeared of us because of Gallandus. ’Tis\r\nthis viper sitteth beside thee, the Goblin swabber, told thee falsely\r\nthis bad tale of us. And ’tis pity he is still inward with thee, for\r\nstill he plotteth evil ’gainst Witchland.”\r\n\r\nDekalajus thrust him aside, saying to Corinius, “Heed not my brother\r\nthough he be hasty and rude of speech; for in wine he speaketh, and\r\nwine is another man. But most true it is, O Corinius, and this shall\r\nthe Duke my father and all we swear and confirm to thee with the\r\nmightiest oaths thou wilt, that Gallandus sought to usurp authority for\r\nthis sake only, to betray our whole army to the enemy. And ’twas only\r\ntherefore Corsus slew him.”\r\n\r\n“That is a flat lie,” said Laxus.\r\n\r\nGro laughed lightly.\r\n\r\nBut Corinius’s sword leaped half naked from the scabbard, and he made\r\na stride toward Corsus and his sons. “Give me the king’s name when ye\r\nspeak to me,” he said, scowling upon them. “You sons of Corsus are not\r\nmen to make me a stalk to catch birds with or to serve your own turn.\r\nAnd thou,” he said, looking fiercely on Corsus, “wert best go meekly,\r\nand not bandy words with me. Thou fool! think’st thou I am Gallandus\r\ncome again? Thou that didst murther him shalt not murther me. Or\r\nthink’st I delivered thee out of the toils thine own folly and thrawart\r\nways had bound thee in, only to suffer thee lord it again here and cast\r\nall amiss again by the unquietness of thy malice? Here is the guard to\r\nbring you down to the ship. And well it is for thee if I slash not off\r\nthy head.”\r\n\r\nNow Corsus and his sons stood for a little doubting in their hearts\r\nwhether it were fitter to leap with their weapons upon Corinius,\r\nputting their fortunes to the hazard of battle in Owlswick hall, or to\r\nembrace necessity and go down to the ship. And this seemed to them the\r\nbetter choice, to go quietly ashipboard; for there stood Corinius and\r\nLaxus and their men, and but few to face them of Corsus’s own people,\r\nthat should be sure for his party if it came to fighting; and withal\r\nthey were not eager to have to do with Corinius, not though it had been\r\non more even terms. So at the last, in anger and bitterness of heart,\r\nthey submitted them to obey his will; and in that same hour Laxus\r\nbrought them to the ship, and put them across the firth to Scaramsey.\r\n\r\nThere were they safe as a mouse in a mill. For Cadarus was skipper of\r\nthat ship, a trusted liegeman of Lord Laxus, and her crew men leal and\r\ntrue to Corinius and Laxus. She lay at anchor as for that night in the\r\nlee of the island, and with the first streak of dawn sailed down the\r\nfirth, bearing Corsus and his sons homeward from Demonland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   XXI: THE PARLEY BEFORE KROTHERING\r\n\r\n  WHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW WARLIKE POLICY AND A PICTURE PAINTED DREW THE\r\n      WAR WESTWARD: AND HOW THE LORD GRO WENT ON AN EMBASSAGE TO\r\n      KROTHERING GATES, AND OF THE ANSWER HE GAT THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it is to be said of Zigg that he failed not to fulfil Spitfire’s\r\nbehest, but gathered hastily an army of more than fifteen hundred\r\nhorse and foot out of the northern dales and the habitations about\r\nShalgreth Heath and the pasture-lands of Kelialand and Switchwater\r\nWay and the region of Rammerick, and came in haste over the Stile.\r\nBut when Corinius knew of this faring from the west, he marched three\r\nthousand strong to meet them above Moonmere Head, to deny them the way\r\nto Galing. But Zigg, being yet in the upper defiles of Breakingdale,\r\nnow for the first time had advertisement of the great slaughter at\r\nThremnir’s Heugh, and how the forces of Spitfire and Volle were broken\r\nand scattered and themselves fled up into the mountains; and so deeming\r\nit small gain with so little an army to give battle to Corinius, he\r\nturned back without more ado and returned hastily over the Stile whence\r\nhe came. Corinius sent light forces to harry his retreat, but being not\r\nminded as then to follow them into the west country, let build a burg\r\nin the throat of the pass in a place of vantage, and stationed there\r\nsufficient men to ward it, and so came again to Owlswick.\r\n\r\nThey that were with Corinius in Demonland numbered now more than five\r\nthousand fighting men: a great and redoubtable army. With these, the\r\nweather being fine and open, he in a short time laid under him all\r\neastern Demonland, save Galing alone. Bremery of Shaws with but\r\nseventy men held Galing for Lord Juss against all assaults. So that\r\nCorinius, thinking this fruit should ripen later and drop into his hand\r\nwhen the rest had been gathered, resolved at winter’s end to march with\r\nhis main army into the west country, leaving a small force to hold down\r\nthe eastlands and contain Bremery in Galing. To this determination he\r\nwas led by all arguments of sound soldiership, most happily seconding\r\nhis own inclinations. For besides this of warlike policy two scarce\r\nweaker lodestones drew him westward: first the old cankered malice he\r\nbare in his heart against the Lord Brandoch Daha, that made Krothering\r\nhis dearest prey; and next, his own lustful desires most outrageously\r\nburning for the Lady Mevrian. And this only for the sight of her\r\npicture, found by him in Spitfire’s closet among his pens and inkstands\r\nand other trinkets, which once looked on he swore that with Heaven’s\r\nwill (ay, or without if so it must be) she should be his paramour.\r\n\r\nSo on the fourteenth day of March, of a bright frosty morn, he with his\r\nmain army marched up Breakingdale and over the Stile, by that same road\r\nthat Lord Juss fared by and Lord Brandoch Daha, that summer’s day when\r\nthey went to take counsel in Krothering before the Impland expedition.\r\nSo came the Witches down to the watersmeet and turned aside to Many\r\nBushes. There they found not Zigg nor his lady wife nor any of his\r\nfolk, but found the house desolate. So they robbed and burned and went\r\ntheir way. And a famous castle of Juss’s they sacked and burned in the\r\nconfines of Kelialand, and another on Switchwater Way, and a summer\r\npalace of Spitfire’s on a little hill above Rammerick Mere. In such\r\nwise they marched victoriously down Switchwater Way, and there was none\r\nto dispute their progress but all fled at the approach of that great\r\narmy and hid themselves in the secret places of the mountains, avoiding\r\ndeath and fate.\r\n\r\nWhen he was come through the straits of Gashterndale up on to\r\nKrothering Side, Corinius let pitch his camp under Erngate End, at the\r\nfoot of the scree-strewn slopes that rise steeply to the high western\r\nface of the mountain, where the lean embattled crags far aloft stand\r\nlike a wall against high heaven.\r\n\r\nCorinius came to Lord Gro and said to him, “To thee will I entrust mine\r\nembassage to this Mevrian. Thou shalt go with a flag of truce to gain\r\nthee entry to the castle; or if they will not admit thee, then bid her\r\nparley with thee without the wall. Then shalt thou use what fantastic\r\ncourtier’s jargon nature and thine invention shall lightliest counsel\r\nthee, and say, ‘Corinius, by the grace of the great King and the might\r\nof his own hand king of Demonland, sitteth as thou well mayst see in\r\npower invincible before this castle. But he willed me let thee know\r\nthat he is not come for to make war against ladies and damosels, and\r\nbe thou of this sure, that neither to thee nor to none of thy fortress\r\nhe will nought say nor hurt. Only this honour he proffereth thee, to\r\nwed thee in sweet marriage and make thee his queen in Demonland.’\r\nWhereto if she say yea, well and good, and we will go up peaceably\r\ninto Krothering and possess it and the woman. But if she deny me this,\r\nthen shalt thou say unto her right fiercely that I will set on against\r\nthe castle like a lion, and neither rest nor give over until I have\r\nbeaten it all to a ruin about her ears and slain the folk with the\r\nedge of the sword. And that which she refuseth me to have in peaceful\r\nlove and kindness I will have of my own violent deed, that she and her\r\nstiff-necked Demons may know that I am their king, and master of all\r\nthat is theirs, and their own bodies but chattels to serve my pleasure.”\r\n\r\nGro said, “My Lord Corinius, choose I pray thee another who shall be\r\nfitter than I to do this errand for thee;” and so for a long time most\r\nearnestly besought him. But Corinius, the more he perceived the duty\r\nhateful to Gro, the firmer became his resolution that none but Gro\r\nshould undertake it. So that in the end Gro perforce consented, and in\r\nthe same hour went with eleven up to the gates of Krothering, and a\r\nwhite flag of truce was borne before him.\r\n\r\nHe sent his herald up to the gate to desire speech of the Lady Mevrian.\r\nAnd in a while the gates were opened, and she came down attended to\r\nmeet Lord Gro in the open garden before the bridge-gate. It was by\r\nthen late afternoon, and the burning sun swam low amid streaked level\r\nclouds incarnadine, setting aflame the waters of Thunderfirth with the\r\nreflection of his beams. From the horizon, high beyond the pine-clad\r\nhills of Westmark, a range of clouds reared themselves, solid and of\r\nan iron hue; so hard-edged against the vapoury sky of sunset, that\r\nthey seemed substantial mountains, not clouds: unearthly mountains (a\r\nman might fancy) divinely raised up for Demonland, for whom not all\r\nher ancient hills gave any longer refuge against her enemies. Here, in\r\nKrothering gates, wintersweet and the little purple daphne bush that\r\nblooms before the leaf breathed fragrance abroad. Yet was it not this\r\nsweetness in the air that troubled the Lord Gro, nor that western glory\r\nburning that dazzled his eyes; but to look upon that lady standing in\r\nthe gate, white-skinned and dark, like the divine Huntress, tall and\r\nproud and lovely.\r\n\r\nMevrian, seeing him speechless, said at last, “My lord, I heard thou\r\nhadst some errand to declare unto me. And seeing a great camp of war\r\ngathered under Erngate End, and having heard of robbers and evil-doers\r\nrife about the land these many moons, I look not for soft speech. Take\r\nheart, therefore, and declare plainly what ill thou meanest.”\r\n\r\nGro answered and said, “Tell me first if thou that speakest art in\r\ntruth the Lady Mevrian, that I may know whether to human kind I speak\r\nor to some Goddess come down from the shining floor of heaven.”\r\n\r\nShe answered, “Of thy compliments I have nought to do. I am she thou\r\nnamest.”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” said Lord Gro, “I would not have brought your highness this\r\nmessage nor delivered it, but that I know full well that did I refuse\r\nit another should bear it thee full speedily, and with less compliment\r\nand less sorrow than I.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded gravely, as who should say, Proceed. So, with what\r\ncountenance he might, he rehearsed his message, saying when it was\r\nended, “Thus, madam, saith Corinius the king: and thus he charged me\r\ndeliver it unto your highness.”\r\n\r\nMevrian heard him attentively with head erect. When he had done she was\r\nsilent a little, still studying him. Then she spake: “Methinks I know\r\nthee now. Thou art Lord Gro of Goblinland that bearest me this message.”\r\n\r\nGro answered, “Madam, he thou namest went years ago from this earth. I\r\nam Lord Gro of Witchland.”\r\n\r\n“So it seemeth, from thy talk,” said she; and was silent again.\r\n\r\nThe steady contemplation from that lady’s eyes was like a knife\r\nscraping his tender skin, so that he was ill at ease well nigh past\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\nAfter a little she said, “I remember thee, my lord. Let me stir thy\r\nmemory. Eleven years ago, my brother went to war in Goblinland against\r\nthe Witches, and overcame them on Lormeron field. There slew he the\r\ngreat King of Witchland in single combat, Gorice X., that until that\r\nday was held for the mightiest man-at-arms in all the world. My brother\r\nwas as then but eighteen winters old, and that was the first blazing up\r\nof his great fame and glory. So King Gaslark made great feasting and\r\ngreat rejoicing in Zajë Zaculo because of the ridding of his land of\r\nthe oppressors. I was at those revels. I saw thee there, my lord; and\r\nbeing but a little maid of eleven summers, sat on thy knee in Gaslark’s\r\nhalls. Thou didst show me books, with pictures in strange colours of\r\ngold and green and scarlet, of birds and beasts and distant countries\r\nand wonders of the world. And I, being a little harmless maid, thought\r\nthee good and kind of heart, and loved thee.”\r\n\r\nShe ceased, and Gro, like a man hath taken some drowsy drug, stood\r\nlooking on her confounded.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” said she, “of this Corinius. Is he such a fighter as men\r\nsay?”\r\n\r\n“He is,” said Gro, “one of the most famousest captains that ever was.\r\nThat might not his worst enemies gainsay.”\r\n\r\nMevrian said, “A likely consort, think’st thou, for a lady of\r\nDemonland? Remember, I have said nay to crowned kings. I would know thy\r\nmind, for doubtless he is thy very familiar friend, since he made thee\r\nhis go-between.”\r\n\r\nGro saw that she mocked, and he was troubled at heart. “Madam,” said\r\nhe, and his voice shook somewhat, “take not in too great scorn this\r\nvile part in me. Verily this I brought thee is the most shamefullest\r\nmessage, and flatly against my will did I deliver it unto thee. Yet\r\nwith such constraint upon me, how could I choose but strike my forehead\r\ninto dauntless marble and word by word deliver my charge?”\r\n\r\n“Thy tongue,” said Mevrian, “hath struck hot irons in my face. Go back\r\nto thy master. If he look for an answer, tell him he may read it in\r\nletters of gold above the gates.”\r\n\r\n“Thy noble brother, madam,” said Gro, “is not here to make good that\r\nanswer.” And he came near to her, saying in a low voice so that only\r\nthey two should hear it, “Be not deceived. This Corinius is a naughty,\r\nwicked, and luxurious youth, that will use thee without any respect\r\nif once he break in by force into Krothering Castle. It were wiselier\r\ncarried to make some open show to receive him; so by fair words and\r\nputting of him off thou mayst yet escape.”\r\n\r\nBut Mevrian said, “Thou hast mine answer. I have no ears to his\r\nrequest. Say too that my cousin the Lord Spitfire hath healed his\r\nwounds, and hath an army afoot shall whip these Witches from my gates\r\nere many days be passed by.”\r\n\r\nSo saying she returned in great scorn within the castle.\r\n\r\nBut the Lord Gro returned again to the camp and to Corinius, who asked\r\nhim how he had sped.\r\n\r\nHe answered, she did utterly refuse it.\r\n\r\n“So,” said Corinius; “doth the puss thump me off? Then pause my hot\r\ndesires an instant, only the more thunderingly to clap it on. For\r\nI will have her. And this coyness and pert rejection hath the more\r\nfixedly confirmed me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     XXII: AURWATH AND SWITCHWATER\r\n\r\n  HOW THE LADY MEVRIAN BEHELD FROM KROTHERING WALLS THE WITCHLAND\r\n      ARMY AND THE CAPTAINS THEREOF: AND OF THE TIDINGS BROUGHT HER\r\n      THERE OF THE WAR IN THE WEST COUNTRY, OF AURWATH FIELD AND THE\r\n      GREAT SLAUGHTER ON SWITCHWATER WAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth day after these doings aforewrit, the Lady Mevrian walked\r\non the battlements of Krothering keep. A blustering wind blew from\r\nthe north-west. The sky was cloudless: clear blue overhead, all else\r\npearl-gray, and the air a little misty. Her old steward, stalwart and\r\nsoldier-like, greaved and helmed and clad in a plated jerkin of bull’s\r\nhide, walked with her.\r\n\r\n“The hour should be about striking,” said she. “’Tis to-day or\r\nto-morrow my Lord Zigg named to me when they were here a-guesting. If\r\nbut Goblinland keep tryst it were the prettiest feat, to take them so\r\npat.”\r\n\r\n“As your ladyship might clap a gnat ’twixt the palms of your two\r\nhands,” said the old man; and he gazed again southward over the sea.\r\n\r\nMevrian set her gaze in the same quarter. “Nothing but mist and spray,”\r\nshe said after a few minutes’ searching. “I’m glad I sent Lord Spitfire\r\nthose two hundred horse. He must have every man can be scraped up, for\r\nsuch a day. How thinkest thou, Ravnor: if King Gaslark come not, hath\r\nLord Spitfire force enow to cope them alone?”\r\n\r\nRavnor chuckled in his beard. “I think and my lord your brother were\r\nhere he should tell your highness ‘ay’ to that. Since first I bowled a\r\nhoop, they taught me a Demon was under-matched against five Witches.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him a little wistfully. “Ah,” she said, “were he at home.\r\nAnd were Juss at home.” Then on a sudden she faced round northward,\r\npointing to the camp. “Were they at home,” she cried, “thou shouldst\r\nnot see outlanders insulting in arms on Krothering Side, sending me\r\nshameful offers, caging me like a bird in this castle. Have such things\r\nbeen in Demonland, until now?”\r\n\r\nNow came a boy running along the battlements from the far side of the\r\ntower, crying that ships were hove in sight sailing from the south and\r\neast, “And they make for the firth.”\r\n\r\n“Of what land?” said Mevrian, while they hastened back to look.\r\n\r\n“What but Goblinland?” said Ravnor.\r\n\r\n“O say not so too hastily!” cried she. They came round the turret wall,\r\nand the sea and Stropardon Firth opened wide and void before them. “I\r\nsee nought,” she said; “or is yon flight of sea-mews the fleet thou\r\nsawest?”\r\n\r\n“He meaneth Thunderfirth,” said Ravnor, who had gone on ahead, pointing\r\nto the west. “They shape their course toward Aurwath. ’Tis King Gaslark\r\nfor sure. Mark but the blue and gold of his sails.”\r\n\r\nMevrian watched them, her gloved hand drumming nervously on the marble\r\nbattlement. Very stately she seemed, muffled in a flowing cloak of\r\nwhite watered silk collared and lined with ermine. “Eighteen ships!”\r\nshe said. “I dreamed not Goblinland might make so great a force.”\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a time, watching the ships sail in to the mouth of\r\nthe firth and make land at Aurwath. “Dear heavens,” she said, “were I\r\na man to help them. Will Spitfire be there in time? The Witches be in\r\ngreat force.”\r\n\r\n“Your ladyship may see,” said Ravnor, walking back along the wall,\r\n“whether the Witchlanders have slept while these ships sailed to port.”\r\n\r\nShe followed and looked. Great stir there was in the Witchland army,\r\nmarshalling before the camp; there was coming and going and leaping on\r\nhorseback, and faintly on the wind their trumpets’ blare was borne to\r\nMevrian’s ears as she beheld them from her high watch-tower. The host\r\nmoved forth down the meadows, all orderly, a-glitter with bronze and\r\nsteel. Southward they came, passing at length through the home-meads\r\nof Krothering, so near that each man was plainly seen from the\r\nbattlements, as they rode beneath.\r\n\r\nMevrian leaned forward in an embrasure, one hand on either battlement\r\nat her left and right. “I would know their names,” said she. “Thou,\r\nthat hast oft fared to the wars, mayst teach me. Gro I know, with a\r\nlong beard; and heart-heaviness it is to see a lord of Goblinland in\r\nsuch a fellowship. What’s he beside him, yon bearded gallant, with a\r\nwinged helm and a diadem about it, like a king’s, and beareth a glaive\r\ncrimson-hafted? He looketh a proud one.”\r\n\r\nThe old man answered, “Laxus of Witchland: the same that was admiral of\r\ntheir fleet against the Ghouls.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis a brave man to look on, and worthy a better cause. What’s he\r\nrideth now below us, heading their horse: ruddy and swarthy and light\r\nof build, hath a brow like the thundercloud, and weareth armour from\r\nneck to toe?”\r\n\r\nRavnor answered, “Highness, I know him not certainly, the sons of\r\nCorund so favour one another. But methinks ’tis the young prince\r\nHeming.”\r\n\r\nMevrian laughed. “Prince quotha?”\r\n\r\n“So moveth the world, your highness. Since Gorice set Corund in kingdom\r\nin Impland——”\r\n\r\nSaid Mevrian, “Name him prithee Heming Faz: I warrant they trap them\r\nnow with barbarous additions. Heming Faz, good lack! lording it now in\r\nDemonland.\r\n\r\n“The prime huff-cap of all,” said she after a little, “holdeth aback\r\nit seemeth. O here he comes. Sweet heaven, what furious horsemanship!\r\nTroth, and he can sit a horse, Ravnor, and hath the great figure of\r\nan athlete. Look where he gallopeth bare-headed down the line. I ween\r\nhe’ll need more than golden curls to keep his head whole ere he have\r\ndone with Gaslark, ay, and our own folk gathering from the north. I\r\nsee he beareth his helm at the saddle-bow. To ape us so!” she cried as\r\nhe drew nearer. “All silks and silver. Thou’dst have sworn none but a\r\nDemon went to battle so costly apparelled. O, for a scissors to cut his\r\ncomb withal!”\r\n\r\nSo speaking she leaned forward all she might, to watch him. And he,\r\ngalloping by below, looked up; and marking her so watching, reined\r\nmightily his great chestnut horse, throwing him with the check well\r\nnigh on his haunches. And while the horse plunged and reared, Corinius\r\nhailed her in a great voice, crying, “Mistress, good-morrow!” crying,\r\n“Wish me victory, and swift to thine arms!”\r\n\r\nSo near below was he a-riding, she might scan the very lineaments of\r\nhis face and read it as he looked up and shouted to her that greeting.\r\nHe saluted with his sword, and spurred onward to overtake Gro and Laxus\r\nin the van.\r\n\r\nAs if sickened on a sudden, or as if she had been ready to tread on a\r\ndeadly stinging adder, the Lady Mevrian leaned against the marble of\r\nthe battlements. Ravnor stepped towards her: “Is your ladyship ill?\r\nWhy, what’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“A silly qualm,” said Mevrian faintly. “If thou’dst medicine it, show\r\nme the sheen of Spitfire’s spears to the northward. The blank land\r\ndazzles me.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nSo wore the afternoon. Twice and thrice Mevrian went upon the\r\nwalls, but could see nought save the sea and the firths and the\r\nmountain-bosomed plain fair and peaceful in the spring-time: no sign\r\nof men or of war’s alarums, save only the masts of Gaslark’s ships\r\nseen over the land’s brow three miles or more to the south-west. Yet\r\nshe knew surely that near those ships beside Aurwath harbour must be\r\ndesperate fighting toward, Gaslark the king engaged at heavy odds\r\nagainst Laxus and Corinius and the spears of Witchland. And the sun\r\nwheeled low over the dark pines of Westmark, and still no sign from the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\n“Thou didst send one forth for tidings?” she said to Ravnor, the third\r\ntime she went on the wall.\r\n\r\nHe answered, “Betimes this morning, your highness. But ’tis slow faring\r\nuntil a be a mile or twain clear of the castle, for a must elude their\r\nsmall bands that go up and down guarding the countryside.”\r\n\r\n“Bring him to me o’ the instant of his return,” said she.\r\n\r\nWith a foot on the stair, she turned back. “Ravnor,” she said.\r\n\r\nHe came to her.\r\n\r\n“Thou,” she said, “hast been years enow my brother’s steward in\r\nKrothering, and our father’s before him, to know what mind and spirit\r\ndwelleth in them of our line. Tell me, truly and sadly, what thou\r\nmakest of this. Lord Spitfire is too late: other else, Goblinland too\r\nsudden-early (and that was his fault from of old). What seest thou in\r\nit? Speak to me as thou shouldst to my Lord Brandoch Daha were it he\r\nthat asked thee.”\r\n\r\n“Highness,” said the old man Ravnor, “I will answer you my very\r\nthought: and it is, woe to Goblinland. Since my Lord Spitfire cometh\r\nnot yet from the north, only the deathless Gods descending out of\r\nheaven can save the king. The Witches number at an humble reckoning\r\ntwice his strength; and man to man you were as well pit a hound against\r\na bear, as against Witches Goblins. For all that these be fierce and\r\nfull of fiery courage, the bear hath it at the last.”\r\n\r\nMevrian listened, looking on him with sorrowful steady eyes. “And he\r\nso generous-noble flown to comfort Demonland in the blackness of her\r\ndays,” she said at last. “Can fate be so ungallant? O Ravnor, the shame\r\nof it! First La Fireez, now Gaslark. How shall any love us any more?\r\nThe shame of it, Ravnor!”\r\n\r\n“I would not have your highness,” said Ravnor, “too hasty to blame us.\r\nIf their plan and compact have gone amiss, ’tis likelier King Gaslark’s\r\nmisprision than Lord Spitfire’s. We know not for sure which day was set\r\nfor this landing.”\r\n\r\nWhile he so spake, he was looking past her seaward, a little south of\r\nthe reddest part of the sunset. His eyes widened. He touched her arm\r\nand pointed. Sails were hoisted among the masts at Aurwath. Smoke, as\r\nof burning, reeked up against the sky. As they watched, the most part\r\nof the ships moved out to sea. From those that remained, some five or\r\nsix, fire leaped and black clouds of smoke. The rest as they came out\r\nof the lee of the land, made southward for the open sea under oar and\r\nsail.\r\n\r\nNeither spake; and the Lady Mevrian leaning her elbows on the parapet\r\nof the wall hid her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow came Ravnor’s messenger at length back from his faring, and the\r\nold man brought him in to Mevrian in her bower in the south part of\r\nKrothering. The messenger said, “Highness, I bring no writing, since\r\nthat were too perilous had I fallen in my way among Witches. But I\r\nhad audience of my Lord Spitfire and my Lord Zigg in the gates of\r\nGashterndale. And thus their lordships commanded me deliver it unto\r\nyou, that your highness should be at ease and secure, seeing that they\r\ndo in such sort hold all the ways to Krothering, that the Witchland\r\narmy cannot escape out of this countryside that is betwixt Thunderfirth\r\nand Stropardon Firth and the sea, but and if they will give battle unto\r\ntheir lordships. But if they choose rather to abide here by Krothering,\r\nthen may our armies close on them and oppress them, since our forces do\r\nexceed theirs by near a thousand spears. Which to-morrow will be done\r\nwhate’er betide, since that is the day appointed for Gaslark the king\r\nto land with a force at Aurwath.”\r\n\r\nMevrian said, “They know nought then of this direful miscarriage, and\r\nGaslark here already before his time and thrown back into the sea?” And\r\nshe said, “We must apprise them on’t, and that hastily and to-night.”\r\n\r\nWhen the man understood this, he answered, “Ten minutes for a bite and\r\na stirrup-cup, and I am at your ladyship’s service.”\r\n\r\nAnd in a short while, that man went forth again secretly out of\r\nKrothering in the dusk of night to bring word to Lord Spitfire of what\r\nwas befallen. And the watchmen watching in the night from Krothering\r\nwalls beheld northward under Erngate End the camp-fires of the Witches\r\nlike the stars.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNight passed and day dawned, and the camp of the Witches showed empty\r\nas an empty shell.\r\n\r\nMevrian said, “They have moved in the night.”\r\n\r\n“Then shall your highness hear great tidings ere long,” said Ravnor.\r\n\r\n“’Tis like we may have guests in Krothering to-night,” said Mevrian.\r\nAnd she gave order for all to be made ready against their coming, and\r\nthe choicest bed-chambers for Spitfire and Zigg to welcome them. So,\r\nwith busy preparations, the day went by. But as evening came, and still\r\nno riding from the north, some shadows of impatience and anxious doubt\r\ncrept with night’s shades creeping across heaven across their eager\r\nexpectancy in Krothering. For Mevrian’s messenger returned not. Late to\r\nrest went the Lady Mevrian; and with the first peeping light she was\r\nabroad, muffled in her great mantle of velvet and swansdown against the\r\neager winds of morning. Up to the battlements she went, and with old\r\nRavnor searched the blank prospect. For pale morning rose on an empty\r\nlandscape; and so all day until the evening: watching, and waiting, and\r\nquestioning in their hearts.\r\n\r\nSo went they at length to supper on this third night after Aurwath\r\nfield. And ere supper was half done was a stir in the outer courts, and\r\nthe rattle of the bridge let down, and a clatter of horse-hooves on\r\nthe bridge and the jasper pavements. Mevrian sate erect and expectant.\r\nShe nodded to Ravnor who wanting no further sign went hastily out, and\r\nreturned in an instant hastily and with heavy brow. He spake in her\r\near, “News, my Lady. It were well you bade him to private audience.\r\nDrink this cup first,” pouring out some wine for her.\r\n\r\nShe rose up, saying to the steward, “Come thou, and bring him with\r\nthee.”\r\n\r\nAs they went he whispered her, “Astar of Rettray, sent by the Lord Zigg\r\nwith matter of urgent import for your highness’s ear.”\r\n\r\nThe Lady Mevrian sat in her ivory chair cushioned with rich stuffed\r\nsilks of Beshtria, with little golden birds and strawberry leaves with\r\nthe flowers and rich red fruits all figured thereon in gorgeous colours\r\nof needlework. She reached out her hand to Astar who stood before her\r\nin his battle harness, muddy and bebloodied from head to foot. He bowed\r\nand kissed her hand: then stood silent. He held his head high and\r\nlooked her in the face, but his eyes were bloodshed and his look was\r\nghastly like a messenger of ill.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Mevrian, “stand not in doubt, but declare all. Thou knowest\r\nit is not in our blood to quail under dangers and misfortune.”\r\n\r\nAstar said, “Zigg, my brother-in-law, gave me this in charge, madam, to\r\ntell thee all truly.”\r\n\r\n“Proceed,” said she. “Thou knowest our last news. Hour by hour since\r\nthen, we watched on victory. I have no mean welcome feast prepared\r\nagainst your coming.”\r\n\r\nAstar groaned. “My Lady Mevrian,” said he, “you must now prepare a\r\nsword, not a banquet. You did send a runner to Lord Spitfire.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said she.\r\n\r\n“He brought us advertisement that night,” said Astar, “of Gaslark’s\r\noverthrow. Alas, that Goblinland was a day too soon, and so bare alone\r\nthe brunt. Yet was vengeance ready to our hand, as we supposed. For\r\nevery pass and way was guarded, and ours the greater force. So for\r\nthat night we waited, seeing Corinius’s fires alight in his camp on\r\nKrothering Side, meaning to smite him at dawn of day. Now in the night\r\nwere mists abroad, and the moon early sunken. And true it is as ill it\r\nis, that the whole Witchland army marched away past us in the dark.”\r\n\r\n“What?” cried Mevrian, “and slept ye all to let them by?”\r\n\r\n“In the middle night,” answered he, “we had sure tidings he was afoot,\r\nand the fires yet burning in his camp a show to mock us withal. By all\r\nsure signs, we might know he was broke forth north-westward, where he\r\nmust take the upper road into Mealand over Brocksty Hause. Zigg with\r\nseven hundred horse galloped to Heathby to head him off, whiles our\r\nmain force fared their swiftest up Little Ravendale. Thou seest, madam,\r\nCorinius must march along the bow and we along the bowstring.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mevrian. “Ye had but to check him with the horse at\r\nHeathby, and he must fight or fall back toward Justdale where he was\r\nlike to lose half his folk in Memmery Moss. Outlanders shall scarce\r\nfind a firm way there in a dark night.”\r\n\r\n“Certain it is we should have had him,” said Astar. “Yet certain it is\r\nhe doubled like a hare and fooled us all to the top of our bent: turned\r\nin his tracks, as later we concluded, somewhere by Goosesand, and with\r\nall his army slipped back eastward under our rear. And that was the\r\nwonderfullest feat heard tell of in all chronicles of war.”\r\n\r\n“Tush, noble Astar,” said Mevrian. “Labour not Witchland’s praises, nor\r\nimagine not I’ll deem less of Spitfire’s nor Zigg’s generalship because\r\nCorinius, by art or fortune’s favour, dodged ’em in the dark.”\r\n\r\n“Dear Lady,” said he, “even look for the worst and prepare yourself for\r\nthe same.”\r\n\r\nHer gray eyes steadily beheld him. “Certain intelligence,” said he,\r\n“was brought us of their faring with all speed they might eastaway past\r\nSwitchwater; and ere the sun looked well over Gemsar Edge we were hot\r\non the track of them, knowing our force the stronger and our only hope\r\nto bring them to battle ere they reached the Stile, where they have\r\nmade a fortress of great strength we might scarce hope to howster them\r\nout from if they should win thither.”\r\n\r\nHe paused. “Well,” said she.\r\n\r\n“Madam,” he said, “that we of Demonland are great and invincible in\r\nwar, ’tis most certain. But in these days fight we as a man that\r\nfighteth hobbled, or with half his gear laid by, or as a man half\r\nroused from sleep. For we be reft of our greatest. Bereft of these,\r\nsuch sorrows befall us and such doom as at Thremnir’s Heugh last autumn\r\nshattered our strength in pieces, and now this very day yet more\r\nterribly hath put us down on Switchwater Way.”\r\n\r\nMevrian’s cheek turned white, but she said no word, waiting.\r\n\r\n“We were eager in the chase,” said Astar. “I have told thee why,\r\nmadam. Thou knowest how near to the mountains runneth the road past\r\nSwitchwater, and the shores of the lake hem in the way for miles\r\nagainst the mountain spurs, and woods clothe the lower slopes, and\r\ndells and gorges run up betwixt the spurs into the mountain side. The\r\nday was misty, and the mists hung by the shores of Switchwater. When\r\nwe had marched so far that our van was about over against the stead of\r\nHighbank that stands on the farther shore, the battle began: greatly to\r\ntheir advantage, since Corinius had placed strong forces in the hills\r\non our right flank, and so ambushed us and took us at unawares. Not to\r\ngrieve thee with a woful tale, madam, we were most bloodily overthrown,\r\nand our army merely brought to not-being. And in the mid rout, Zigg\r\nstole an instant to charge me by my love for him ride to Krothering as\r\nif my life lay on it and the weal of all of us, and bid you fly hence\r\nto Westmark or the isles or whither you will, ere the Witches come\r\nagain and here entrap you. Since save for these walls and these few\r\nbrave soldiers you have to ward them, no help standeth any more ’twixt\r\nyou and these devilish Witches.”\r\n\r\nStill she was silent. He said, “Let me not be too hateful to you, most\r\ngracious Lady, for this rude tale of disaster. The suddenness of the\r\ntimes bar any pleasant glozing. And indeed I thought I should satisfy\r\nyou more with plainness, than should opinion of I know not what false\r\ncourtliness bind me to show you comfort where comfort is not.”\r\n\r\nThe Lady Mevrian stood up and took him by both hands. Surely the light\r\nof that lady’s eyes was like the new light of morning glancing through\r\nmists on the gray still surface of a mountain tarn, and the accent of\r\nher voice sweet as the voices of the morning as she said, “O Astar,\r\nthink me not so unhandsome, nor yet so foolish. Thanks, gentle Astar.\r\nBut thou hast not supped, and sure in a great soldier battle and swift\r\nfar riding should breed hunger, how ill soever the news he beareth. Thy\r\nwelcome shall not be the colder because we looked for more than thee,\r\nalas, and for far other tidings. A chamber is prepared for thee. Eat\r\nand drink; and when night is done is time enough to speak more of these\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” he said, “you must come now or ’tis too late.”\r\n\r\nBut she answered him, “No, noble Astar. This is my brother’s house.\r\nSo long as I may keep it for him against his coming home I will not\r\ncreep out of Krothering like a rat, but stand to my watch. And this is\r\ncertain, I shall not open Krothering gates to Witches whiles I and my\r\nfolk yet live to bar them against them.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nSo she made him go to supper; but herself sat late that night alone in\r\nthe Chamber of the Moon, that was in the donjon keep above the inner\r\ncourt in Krothering. This was Lord Brandoch Daha’s banquet chamber,\r\ndevised and furnished by him in years gone by; and here he and she\r\ncommonly sat at meat, using not the banquet hall across the court save\r\nwhen great company was present. Round was that chamber, following the\r\nround walls of the tower that held it. All the pillars and the walls\r\nand the vaulted roof were of a strange stone, white and smooth, and\r\nyielding such a glistering show of pallid gold in it as was like the\r\ngolden sheen of the full moon of a warm night in midsummer. Lamps that\r\nwere milky opals self-effulgent filled all the chamber with a soft\r\nradiance, in which the bas-reliefs of the high dado, delicately carved,\r\nportraying those immortal blooms of amaranth and nepenthe and moly and\r\nElysian asphodel, were seen in all their delicate beauty, and the fair\r\npainted pictures of the Lord of Krothering and his lady sister, and\r\nof Lord Juss above the great open fireplace with Goldry and Spitfire\r\non his left and right. A few other pictures there were, smaller than\r\nthese: the Princess Armelline of Goblinland, Zigg and his lady wife,\r\nand others; wondrous beautiful.\r\n\r\nHere a long while sat the Lady Mevrian. She had a little lute\r\nwrought of sweet sandalwood and ivory inlaid with gems. While she sat\r\na-thinking, her fingers strayed idly on the strings, and she sang in a\r\nlow sweet voice:\r\n\r\n    There were three ravens sat on a tree,\r\n    They were as black as they might be.\r\n      _With a downe, derrie down._\r\n\r\n    The one of them said to his make,\r\n    Where shall we our breakefast take?\r\n\r\n    Downe in yonder greene field,\r\n    There lies a knight slain under his shield.\r\n\r\n    His hounds they lie downe at his feete,\r\n    So well they can their master keepe.\r\n\r\n    His haukes they flie so eagerly,\r\n    There’s no fowle dare him come nie.\r\n\r\n    Downe there comes a fallow doe\r\n    As great with yong as she might goe.\r\n\r\n    She lift up his bloudy hed,\r\n    And kist his wounds that were so red.\r\n\r\n    She gat him up upon her backe,\r\n    And carried him to earthen lake.\r\n\r\n    She buried him before the prime;\r\n    She was dead herselfe ere even-song time.\r\n\r\n    God send every gentleman\r\n    Such haukes, such hounds, and such a leman.\r\n      _With a downe, derrie down._\r\n\r\nWith the last sighing sweetness trembling from the strings, she laid\r\naside the lute, saying, “The discord of my thoughts, my lute, doth ill\r\nagree with the harmonies of thy strings. Put it by.”\r\n\r\nShe fell to gazing on her brother’s picture, the Lord Brandoch Daha,\r\nstanding in his jewelled hauberk laced about with gold, his hand upon\r\nhis sword. And that lazy laughter-loving yet imperious look of the\r\neyes which in life he had was there, wondrous lively caught by the\r\npainter’s art, and the lovely lines of his brow and lip and jaw, where\r\npower and masterful determination slumbered, as brazen Ares might\r\nslumber in the arms of the Queen of Love.\r\n\r\nA long while Mevrian looked on that picture, musing. Then, burying her\r\nface in the cushions of the long low seat she sat on, she burst into a\r\ngreat passion of tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              XXIII: THE WEIRD BEGUN OF ISHNAIN NEMARTRA\r\n\r\n  OF THE COUNSEL TAKEN BY THE WITCHES TOUCHING THE CONDUCT OF THE\r\n      WAR: WHEREAFTER IN THE FIFTH ASSAULT THE CASTLE OF LORD\r\n      BRANDOCH DAHA WAS MADE A PREY UNTO CORINIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow was little time for debate or conjecture, but with the morrow’s\r\nmorn came the Witchland army once more before Krothering, and a herald\r\nsent by Corinius to bid Mevrian yield up the castle and her own proper\r\nperson lest a worse thing befall them. Which she stoutly refusing,\r\nCorinius let straight assault the castle, but won it not. And in the\r\nnext three days following he thrice assaulted Krothering, and, failing\r\nwith some loss of men to win an entry, closely invested it.\r\n\r\nAnd now summoned he those other lords of Witchland to talk with him.\r\n“How say ye? Or what rede shall we take? They be few only within to man\r\nthe walls; and great shame it is to us and to all Witchland if we get\r\nnot this hold taken, so many as we be here gone up against it, and so\r\ngreat captains.”\r\n\r\nLaxus said, “Thou art king in Demonland. Thine it is to take order what\r\nshall be done. But if thou desire my rede, then shall I give it thee.”\r\n\r\n“I desire each one of you,” said Corinius, “to show forth to me frankly\r\nand freely his rede. And well ye know I strive for nought else but for\r\nWitchland’s glory and to make firm our conquest here.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Laxus, “I told thee once already my counsel, and thou wast\r\nangry with me. Thou madest a mighty victory on Switchwater Way; which\r\nhad we followed up, pushing home the sword of our advantage till the\r\nhilts came clap against the breastplate of our adversary, we might now\r\nhave exterminated from the land the whole nest of them, Spitfire, Zigg,\r\nand Volle. But now are they gotten away the devil knows whither, for\r\nthe preparing of fresh thorns to prick our sides withal.”\r\n\r\nCorinius said, “Claim not wisdom after the event, my lord. ’Twas not so\r\nthou didst advise. Thou didst bid me let go Krothering: a thing I will\r\nnot do, once I have set mine hand to it.”\r\n\r\nLaxus answered him, “Not only did I so advise thee as I have said, but\r\nHeming was by, and will bear me out, that I did offer that he or I\r\nwith a small force should keep this comfit-box shut for thee till thou\r\nshouldst have done the main business.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis so,” said Heming.\r\n\r\nBut Corinius said, “’Tis not so, Heming. And were it so, ’tis easily\r\nseen why he or thou shouldst hanker for first suck at this luscious\r\nfruit. Yet not so easy to see why I should yield it you.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said Laxus, “is very ill said. I see thy memory needs jogging,\r\nand thou art sliding into ingratitude. How many such like fruits hast\r\nthou enjoyed since we came out hither, that we had all the pains and\r\nplucking of?”\r\n\r\n“O cry thee mercy, my lord,” said Corinius, “I should have remembered,\r\ndreams of Sriva’s moist lips keep thee from straying. But enough of\r\nthis fooling: to the matter.”\r\n\r\nLord Laxus flushed. “By my faith,” said he, “this is very much to the\r\nmatter. ’Twere well, Corinius, if thy loose thoughts were kept from\r\nstraying. Spend men on a fortress? Better assay Galing, then: that were\r\na prize worth more to our safety and our lordship here.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Heming. “Seek out the enemy. ’Tis therefore we came hither:\r\nnot to find women for thee.”\r\n\r\nThereupon the Lord Corinius struck him across the table a great buffet\r\nin the face. Heming, mad wroth, snatched out a dagger; but Gro and\r\nLaxus catching him one by either hand restrained him. Gro said, “My\r\nlords, my lords, you must not word it so dangerous ill. We have but one\r\nheart and mind here, to magnify our Lord the King and his glory. Thou,\r\nHeming, forget not the King hath put authority in the hand of Corinius,\r\nso that thy dagger set against him setteth most treasonably against the\r\nKing’s majesty. And thou, my lord, I pray be temperate in thy power.\r\nSure, for want of open war it is that our hands be so ready for these\r\nprivate brawls.”\r\n\r\nWhen by fair words this stew was cooled again, Corinius bade Gro say\r\nforth his mind, what he thought lay next to do. Gro answered, “My lord,\r\nI am of Laxus’s opinion. Abiding here by Krothering, we fare as idle\r\ncooks toying with sweetmeats while the roast spoils. We should seek out\r\npower and destroy it where still it fareth free, lest it swell again\r\nto a growth may danger us: wheresoever these lords be fled, think not\r\nthey’ll be slack to prepare a mischief for us.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Corinius, “ye be all three of an accord against me. But\r\nthere is no one beam of these thoughts your discourse hath planted in\r\nme, but is able to discern a greater cloud than you do go in.”\r\n\r\n“It is very true,” said Laxus, “that we do think somewhat scornfully of\r\nthis war against women.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, there’s the cover off the dish!” said Corinius, “and a pretty\r\nmess within. Y’are woman-mad, every jack of you, and this blears your\r\neyes to think me sick o’ the same folly. Thou and thy little dark-eyed\r\nbaggage, that I dare swear hath months ago forgot thee for another.\r\nHeming here and I know not what sweet maid his young heart doteth on.\r\nGro, ha! ha!” and he fell a-laughing. “Wherefore the King saddled me\r\nwith this Goblin, he only knoweth, and his secretary the Devil: not\r\nI. By Satan, thou hast a starved look i’ the eyes giveth me to think\r\nthe errand I sent thee to Krothering gates did thee no good. My cat’s\r\nleering look showeth me that my cat goeth a catterwawing. Dost now find\r\nthe raven’s wing a seemlier hue in a wench’s hair to set thy cold blood\r\na-leaping than tawny red? Or dost think this one hath a softer breast\r\nthan thy Queen’s to cushion thy perfumed locks?”\r\n\r\nWith that word spoken, all three of them leaped from their seats. Gro,\r\nwith a face ashen gray, said, “At me thou mayst spit what filth thou\r\nwilt. I am schooled to bear with it for Witchland’s sake and until\r\nthine own venom choke thee. But this shalt thou not do whiles I live,\r\nthou or any other: to let thy bawdy tongue meddle with Queen Prezmyra’s\r\nname.”\r\n\r\nCorinius sat still in his chair in a posture of studied ease, but\r\nhis sword was ready. His great jowl was set, his insolent blue eyes\r\nscornfully looked from one to another of those lords where they stood\r\nmenacing him. “Pshaw!” said he, at last. “Who brought her name into it\r\nbut thyself, my Lord Gro? not I.”\r\n\r\n“Thou wert best not bring it in again, Corinius,” said Heming. “Have we\r\nnot well followed thee and upheld thee? And so shall we do henceforth.\r\nBut remember, I am King Corund’s son. And if thou speak this wicked lie\r\nagain, it shall cost thee thy life if I may.”\r\n\r\nCorinius threw out his arms and laughed. “Come,” said he, standing up,\r\nwith much show of jolly friendliness, “’twas but a jest; and, I freely\r\nacknowledge, an ill jest. I’m sorry for it, my lords.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said he, “come we again to the matter. Krothering Castle\r\nwill I not forgo, since ’tis not my way to turn back for any man on\r\nearth, no not for the Gods almighty, once I have ta’en my course. But\r\nI will make a bargain with you, and this it is: that we to-morrow do\r\nassault the hold a last time, using all our men and all our might. And\r\nif, as I think is most unlikely and most shameful, we get it not, then\r\nshall we fare away and do according to thy counsel, O Laxus.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis now four days lost,” said Laxus. “Thou canst not retrieve them.\r\nHowso, be it as thou wilt.”\r\n\r\nSo brake up their council. But the mind and heart of the Lord Gro was\r\nnought peaceful within him, but tumultuous with manifold imaginings\r\nof hopes and fears and old desires, that intertwined like serpents\r\ntwisting and contending. So that nought was clear to him save the\r\nunclear trouble of his discontent; and it was as if the conscience of a\r\nsecret grant his inward mind made had suddenly cast a vail betwixt his\r\nthoughts and him that he durst not pluck aside.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nBetimes on the morrow Corinius let fare against Krothering with all his\r\nhost, Laxus from the south, Heming and Cargo from the east against the\r\nmain gates, and himself from the west where the walls and towers showed\r\nstrongest but the natural strength of the place weaker than elsewhere.\r\nNow they within were few, because of Mevrian’s sending of those two\r\nhundred horse to follow Zigg and those came not back after Switchwater;\r\nand as the day wore, and still the battle went forward, and still were\r\nwounds given and taken, the odds swung yet heavier against them of\r\nDemonland, and more and more must the castle hold of its own strength\r\nonly, for there were not whole men left enow to man the walls. And now\r\nhad Corinius well nigh won the castle, faring up on the walls west of\r\nthe donjon tower where he and his fell to clearing the battlements,\r\nrushing on like wolves. But Astar of Rettray stayed him there with so\r\ngreat a sword-stroke on the helm that he overthrew him all astonied\r\ndown without the wall and into the ditch; but his men drew him forth\r\nand saved him. So was the Lord Corinius put out of the fight; but\r\ngreatly still he egged on his men. And about the fifth hour after noon\r\nthe sons of Corund gat the main gate.\r\n\r\nLady Mevrian bare in that hour with her own hand a stoup of wine to\r\nAstar in a lull of the battle. While he drank, she said, “Astar, the\r\nhour demandeth that I pledge thee to obedience, even as I pledged mine\r\nown folk and Ravnor that here commandeth my garrison in Krothering.”\r\n\r\n“My Lady Mevrian,” answered he, “under your safety, I shall obey you.”\r\n\r\nShe said, “No conditions, sir. Harken and know. First I will thank thee\r\nand these valiant men that so mightily warded us and golden Krothering\r\nagainst our enemies. This was my mind, to ward it unto the last,\r\nbecause it is my dear brother’s house, and I count it unworthy Corinius\r\nshould stable his horses in our chambers, and carousing amid his\r\ndrunkards do hurt to our fair banquet hall. But now, by hard necessity\r\nof disastrous war, hath this thing come to pass, and all fallen into\r\nhis hand save only this keep alone.”\r\n\r\n“Alas, madam,” said he, “to our shame I may not deny it.”\r\n\r\n“O trample out any thought of shame,” said she. “A score of them\r\nagainst every one of us: the glory of our defence shall be for ever.\r\nBut now ’tis for me mainly he still beareth against Krothering so great\r\nand peisant strokes as thick as rain falleth from the sky. And now must\r\nye obey me and do my commandment; else must we perish, for even this\r\ntower we are not enough to hold against him many days.”\r\n\r\n“Divine Lady,” said Astar, “but once shall one pass the cruel pass of\r\ndeath. I and your folk will defend you unto that end.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said she, standing like a queen before him, “I shall now defend\r\nmyself and our precious things in Krothering more certainly than ye men\r\nof war may do.” And she showed him shortly that this was her design,\r\nto yield up the keep unto Corinius under promise of a safe conduct for\r\nAstar and Ravnor and all her men.\r\n\r\n“And submit thee to this Corinius?” said Astar. But she answered, “Thy\r\nsword hath likely cut his claws for awhile. I fear him not.”\r\n\r\nOf all this would Astar at first have nought to do, and the old steward\r\nwithal was well nigh mutinous. But so firm of purpose was she, and\r\nwithal showed them so plainly that this was the only hope to save\r\nherself and Krothering, and the Witches must else sack the house of\r\nKrothering and in a few days win the keep, “and then, snaky despair;\r\nand the fault on’t not in fortune but in ourselves, that could not\r\nframe ourselves to our fortune”; that at last with heavy hearts they\r\nconsented to do her bidding.\r\n\r\nWithout more ado, was a parley called, Mevrian speaking for herself\r\nfrom a high window opening on the court and Gro for Corinius. In which\r\nparley it was articled that she should render up the tower; and that\r\nthe fighting men which were within should have peace and safe passage\r\nwhither they would; and that there should be no scathe nor outrage done\r\nto Krothering neither to the lands thereof; and that all this should\r\nbe writ down and sealed under the hands of Corinius, Gro, and Laxus,\r\nand the gates opened to the Witches and all keys delivered up within an\r\nhalf hour of the giving of the sealed writing into Mevrian’s hand.\r\n\r\nNow was all this performed accordingly, and Krothering keep rendered\r\nto the Lord Corinius. Astar and Ravnor and their men would have abided\r\nas prisoners for Mevrian’s sake, but Corinius would not suffer it,\r\nvowing with bloody imprecations that he would let slay out of hand any\r\nman of them he should take after an hour’s space within three miles of\r\nKrothering. So, under Mevrian’s strait commands, they departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      XXIV: A KING IN KROTHERING\r\n\r\n  HOW THE LORD CORINIUS WOULD TAKE UNTO HIMSELF A QUEEN IN DEMONLAND,\r\n      AND MADE HIM A BRIDAL FEAST THERETO: WHEREIN IS A NOTABLE\r\n      INSTANCE HOW UNTO THEM WHICH THE GODS DO LOVE HELPERS ARE\r\n      RAISED UP AND COMFORTERS EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THEIR ENEMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same evening Corinius let dight a banquet in the Chamber of the\r\nMoon for some two score of his chiefest men, a very pompous and kingly\r\nentertainment; and conceiving that he might now very well avail to\r\naccomplish his pleasure touching the Lady Mevrian, he sent her word by\r\none of his gentlemen that she should attend him there. And she sending\r\nanswer to tell him gently all else in the castle was at his service,\r\nbut for herself she was quite fordone and greatly desired rest and\r\nsleep that night, he fell a-laughing immoderately and saying, “A most\r\nunseasonable desire, and one that smacketh besides of mockery, since\r\nwell she knoweth what this night I do intend. Wish her to repair to us,\r\nand that right swiftly, lest I fetch her.”\r\n\r\nTo that message sent her came she in a short while herself to answer,\r\ndressed all in funereal black, her gown and close-fitting bodice of\r\nblack sendal slashed with black sarcenett, and about her throat a chain\r\nof sapphires darkly lustrous. Very nobly she carried her head. Framed\r\nwith the piled and braided masses of her night-dark hair, her face\r\nshowed pale indeed, but unruffled and undismayed.\r\n\r\nAll at her coming in stood up to greet her; and Corinius said, “Lady,\r\nthou didst change thy mind quickly since thou didst first affirm thou\r\nnever wouldst yield up Krothering unto me.”\r\n\r\n“As quickly as I might, my lord,” said she, “for I saw I was wrong.”\r\n\r\nHe abode silent a minute, his eyes like amorous surfeiters over-running\r\nher fair form. Then said he, “Thou didst wish to purchase safety for\r\nthy friends?”\r\n\r\nShe answered, “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“For thine own self,” said Corinius, “it had made no jot of difference.\r\nBe witness unto me the omnisciency of the Gods, whereunto is nothing\r\nconcealable, I mean thee only good.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said she, “I embrace the comfort of that word. And know that\r\ngood to me is mine own freedom: not conditions of any man’s choosing.”\r\n\r\nWhereto he, being well tippled with wine, framing the most lovely\r\ncountenance he might, made answer, “I doubt not but to-night, madam,\r\nthou shalt be well advised to choose that highest condition, and till\r\nto-day unknown, which I shall proffer thee: to be Queen of Demonland.”\r\n\r\nShe thanked him in her best manner, but said she was minded to forgo\r\nthat supposedly pleasing eminence.\r\n\r\n“How?” said he. “Is it too little a thing for thee? Or is it as I\r\nthink, that thou laughest?”\r\n\r\nShe said, “My lord, it should little beseem me that am of the seed\r\nof men of war since long generations to trap my mind with the false\r\nshows of a greatness that is gone. Yet I pray you forget not this: the\r\ndominion of the Demons hath used to soar a pitch above common royalty,\r\nand like the eye of day regarded kings from above. And for this style\r\nof Queen thou offerest me, I say unto thee it is an addition I desire\r\nnot, who am sister unto him that writ that writing above the gate that\r\nall ye had tasted the truth thereof had he been here to meet with you.”\r\n\r\nCorinius said, “True it is, some have out-bragged the world, yet I ere\r\nthis have used them like knaves. My jack-boot hath known things in\r\nCarcë, madam, I’ll not gall thy heart to tell thee of.” But perceiving\r\na great lowe of disdainful anger blaze in Mevrian’s eye, “Cry you\r\nmercy,” said he, “incomparable lady; this was beside the mark. I would\r\nnot sully our new friendship with memories of—— Ho there! a chair\r\nbeside me for the Queen.”\r\n\r\nBut Mevrian made them set it on the far side of the board, and there\r\nsat her down, saying, “I pray thee, my Lord Corinius, unsay that word.\r\nThou knowest it dislikes me.”\r\n\r\nHe looked on her in silence for a minute, leaned forward across the\r\nboard, his lips parted a little and between them his breath coming\r\nand going thick and swift. “Well,” he said, “sit there, and it like\r\nthee, madam, and manage my delights by stages. Last year the wide\r\nworld betwixt us: this year the mountains: yestereve Krothering walls:\r\nto-night a table’s breadth: and ere night be done, not so much as——”\r\n\r\nGro saw the wild-deer look in Lady Mevrian’s eyes. She said, “This is\r\ntalk I have not learned to understand, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“I shall learn it thee,” said Corinius, his face aflame. “Lovers live\r\nby love as larks by leeks. By Satan, I do love thee as thou wert the\r\nheart out of my body.”\r\n\r\n“My Lord Corinius,” said she, “we ladies of the north have little\r\nstomach for these fashions, howe’er they commend them in waterish\r\nWitchland. If thou’lt have my friendship, bring me service therefor,\r\nand that in season. This is no fit table-talk.”\r\n\r\n“Why there,” said he, “we’re in fast agreement. I’ll blithely show thee\r\nall this, and a quainter thing beside, in thine own chamber. But ’twas\r\nbeyond my hopes thou’dst grant me that so suddenly. Are we so happy?”\r\n\r\nIn great shame and anger the Lady Mevrian stood up from the table.\r\nCorinius, something unsteadily, leaped to his feet. For all his\r\nbigness, so tall she was she looked him level in the eye. And he, as\r\nwhen in the face of a night-ranging beast suddenly a man brandishes\r\na bright light, stood stupid under that gaze, the springs of action\r\nstrangely frozen in him on a sudden, and said sullenly, “Madam, I am a\r\nsoldier. Truly mine affection standeth not upon compliment. That I am\r\nimpatient, put the wite on thy beauty not on me. Pray you, be seated.”\r\n\r\nBut Mevrian answered, “Thy language, my lord, is too bold and vicious.\r\nCome to me to-morrow if thou wilt; but I’ll have thee know, patience\r\nonly and courtesy shall get good of me.”\r\n\r\nShe turned to the door. He, as if with the turning away of that lady’s\r\neyes the spell was broke, cried loudly upon his folk to stay her. But\r\nthere was none stirred. Therewith he, as one that cannot command his\r\nown indecent appetites, o’ersetting bench and board in eager haste to\r\nlay hands on her, it so betided that he tripped up with one of these\r\nand fell a-sprawling. And ere he was gotten again on his feet, the Lady\r\nMevrian was gone from the hall.\r\n\r\nHe rose up painfully, proffering from his lips a mud-spring of\r\nbarbarous and filthy imprecations; so that Laxus who helped raise him\r\nup was fain to chide him, saying, “My lord, unman not thyself by such\r\na bestial transformation. Are not we yet with harness on our backs in\r\na kingdom newly gained, the old lords thereof discomfited indeed but\r\nnot yet ta’en nor slain, studying belike to raise new powers against\r\nus? And above such and so many affairs wilt thou make place for the\r\nallurements of love?”\r\n\r\n“Ay!” answered he. “Nor shall such a sapless ninny as thou avail to\r\ncross me therein. Ask thy little gamesome Sriva, when thou comest home\r\nto wed her, if I be not better able than thou to please a woman. She’ll\r\ntell thee! I’ the mean season meddle not in matters that be too high\r\nfor such as thou.”\r\n\r\nBoth Gro and the sons of Corund were by and heard those words. The Lord\r\nLaxus schooled himself to laugh. He turned toward Gro, saying, “The\r\ngeneral is far gone in wine.”\r\n\r\nGro, marking Laxus’s face flushed red to the ears for all his studied\r\ncarelessness, answered him softly, “’Tis so, my lord. And in wine is\r\ntruth.”\r\n\r\nNow Corinius, bethinking him that it was yet early and the feast barely\r\nwell begun, let set a guard on all the passages which led to Mevrian’s\r\nlodgings, to the end that she might not issue therefrom but there wait\r\non his pleasure. That done, he bade renew their feasting.\r\n\r\nNo stint of luscious meats and wines was there, and the lords of\r\nWitchland sat them down again right eagerly to the good banquet. Laxus\r\nspoke secretly to Gro: “I wot well thou takest in very ill part these\r\ndoings. Let it stand firm in thy mind that if thou shouldst deem it\r\nfitting to play him a trick and steal the lady from him, I’ll not stand\r\ni’ the way on’t.”\r\n\r\n“In a bunch of cards,” said Gro, “knaves wait upon the kings. It were\r\nnot so ill done and we made it so here. I heard a bird sing lately thou\r\nhadst a quarrel to him.”\r\n\r\n“Thou must not think so,” answered Laxus. “I’ll give thee still a\r\nRoland for thine Oliver, and tell thee ’tis most apparent thyself dost\r\nlove this lady.”\r\n\r\nGro said, “Thou chargest me with a sweet folly is foreign to my nature,\r\nbeing a grave scholar that if ever I did frequent such toys have long\r\neschewed them. Only meseems ’tis an ill thing if she must be given\r\nover unto him against her will. Thou knowest him of a rough and mere\r\nsoldierly mind, besides his dissolute company with other women.”\r\n\r\n“Tush,” said Laxus, “he may go his gate for me, and be as close as a\r\nbutterfly with the lady. But out of policy, ’twere best rid her hence.\r\nI’d not be seen in’t. That provided, I’ll second thee all ways. If he\r\nlie here the summer long in amorous dalliance, justly might the King\r\nabraid us that midst o’ the day’s sport we gave his good hawk a gorge,\r\nand so lost him the game.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Gro, smiling in himself, “thou art a man of sober\r\ngovernment and understanding, and thinkest first of Witchland. And that\r\nis both just and right.”\r\n\r\nNow went the feast forward with great surfeiting and swigging of\r\nwine. Mevrian’s women that were there, much against their own good\r\nwill, to serve the banquet, set ever fresh dishes before the feasters\r\nand poured forth fresh wines, golden and tawny and ruby-red, in the\r\ngoblets of jade and crystal and hammered gold. The air in the fair\r\nchamber was thick with the steam of bake-meats and the vinous breath\r\nof the feasters, so that the lustre of the opal lamps burned coppery,\r\nand about each lamp was a bush of coppery beams like the beams about\r\na torch that burns in a fog. Great was the clatter of cups, and great\r\nthe clinking of glass as in their drunkenness the Witches cast down\r\nthe priceless beakers on the floor, smashing them in shivers. And huge\r\ndin there was of laughter and song; and amidst of it, women’s voices\r\nsinging, albeit near drowned in the hurly burly. For they constrained\r\nMevrian’s damosels in Krothering to sing and dance before them,\r\nhowsoever woeful at heart. And to other entertainment than this of\r\ndance and song was many a black-bearded reveller willing to constrain\r\nthem; and sought occasion thereto, but this by stealth only, and out\r\nof eye-shot of their general. For heavily enow was his wrath fallen on\r\nsome who rashly flaunted in his face their light disports, presuming to\r\nhunt in such fields while their lord went still a-fasting.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Heming, who sat next to Gro, began to say to him in a\r\nwhisper, “This is an ill banquet.”\r\n\r\n“Meseems rather ’tis a very good banquet,” said Gro.\r\n\r\n“Would I saw some other issue thereof,” said Heming, “than that he\r\npurposeth. Or how thinkest thou?”\r\n\r\n“I scarce can blame him,” answered Gro. “’Tis a most lovesome lady.”\r\n\r\n“Is not the man a most horrible open swine? And is it to be endured\r\nthat he should work his lewd purpose on so sweet a lady?”\r\n\r\n“What have I to do with it?” said Gro.\r\n\r\n“What less than I?” said Heming.\r\n\r\n“It dislikes thee?” said Gro.\r\n\r\n“Art thou a man?” said Heming. “And she that hateth him besides as\r\nbloody Atropos!”\r\n\r\nGro looked him a swift searching look in the eye. Then he whispered,\r\nhis head bowed over some raisins he was a-picking: “If this is thy\r\nmind, ’tis well.” And speaking softly, with here and there some snatch\r\nof louder discourse or jest between whiles lest he should seem too\r\nearnestly engaged in secret talk, he taught Heming orderly and clearly\r\nwhat he had to do, discovering to him that Laxus also, being bit\r\nwith jealousy, was of their accord. “Thy brother Cargo is aptest for\r\nthis. He standeth about her height, and by reason of his youth is yet\r\nbeardless. Go find him out. Rehearse unto him word by word all this\r\ntalking that hath been between me and thee. Corinius holdeth me too\r\ndeep suspect to suffer me out of his eye to-night. Unto you sons of\r\nCorund therefore is the task; and I biding at his elbow may avail to\r\nhold him here i’ the hall till it be performed. Go; and wise counsel\r\nand good speed wait on your attempts.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe Lady Mevrian, being escaped to her own chamber in the south tower,\r\nsat by an eastern window that looked across the gardens and the lake,\r\npast the sea-lochs of Stropardon and the dark hills of Eastmark, to the\r\nstately ranges afar which overhang in mid-air Mosedale and Murkdale\r\nand Swartriverdale and the inland sea of Throwater. The last lights of\r\nday still lingered on their loftier summits: on Ironbeak, on the gaunt\r\nwall of Skarta, and on the distant twin towers of Dina seen beyond the\r\nlower Mosedale range in the depression of Neverdale Hause. Behind them\r\nrolled up the ascent of heaven the wheels of quiet Night: holy Night,\r\nmother of the Gods, mother of sleep, tender nurse of all little birds\r\nand beasts that dwell in the field and all tired hearts and weary:\r\nmother besides of strange children, affrights, and rapes, and midnight\r\nmurders bold.\r\n\r\nMevrian sat there till all the earth was blurred in darkness and the\r\nsky a-throb with starlight, for it was yet an hour until the rising of\r\nthe moon. And she prayed to Lady Artemis, calling her by her secret\r\nnames and saying, “Goddess and Maiden chaste and holy; triune Goddess,\r\nWhich in heaven art, and on the earth Huntress divine, and also hast in\r\nthe veiled sunless places below earth Thy dwelling, viewing the large\r\nstations of the dead: save me and keep me that am Thy maiden still.”\r\n\r\nShe turned the ring upon her finger and scanned in the gathering\r\ngloom the bezel thereof, which was of that chrysoprase that is hid\r\nin light and seen in darkness, being as a flame by night but in the\r\nday-time yellow or wan. And behold, it palpitated with splendour from\r\nwithinward, and was as if a thousand golden sparks danced and swirled\r\nwithin the stone.\r\n\r\nWhile she pondered what interpretation lay likeliest on this sudden\r\nflowering of unaccustomed splendour within the chrysoprase, behold one\r\nof her women of the bed-chamber who brought lights, and said, standing\r\nbefore her, “Twain of those lords of Witchland would speak with your\r\nladyship in private.”\r\n\r\n“Two?” said Mevrian. “There’s safety yet in numbers. Which be they?”\r\n\r\n“Highness, they be tall and slim of body. They be black-avised. They\r\nbear them discreet as dormice, and most commendably sober.”\r\n\r\nMevrian asked, “Is it the Lord Gro? Hath he a great black beard, much\r\ncurled and perfumed?”\r\n\r\n“Highness, I marked not that either weareth a beard,” said the woman,\r\n“nor their names I know not.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mevrian, “admit them. And do thou and thy fellows attend\r\nme whiles I give them audience.”\r\n\r\nSo it was done according to her bidding. And there entered in those two\r\nsons of Corund.\r\n\r\nThey greeted her with respectful salutations, and Heming said, “Our\r\nerrand, most worshipful lady, was for thine own ear only if it please\r\nthee.”\r\n\r\nMevrian said to her women, “Make fast the doors, and attend me in the\r\nante-chamber. And now, my lords,” said she, and waited for them to\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\nShe was seated sideways in the window, betwixt the light and the dark.\r\nThe crystal lamps shining from within the room showed deeper darknesses\r\nin her hair than night’s darkness without. The curve of her white arms\r\nresting in her lap was like the young moon cradled above the sunset. A\r\nfalling breeze out of the south came laden with the murmur of the sea,\r\nfar away beyond fields and vineyards, restlessly surging even in that\r\ncalm weather amid the sea-caves of Stropardon. It was as if the sea\r\nand the night enfolding Demonland gasped in indignation at such things\r\nas Corinius, holding himself already an undoubted possessor of his\r\ndesires, devised for that night in Krothering.\r\n\r\nThose brethren stood abashed in the presence of such rare beauty.\r\nHeming with a deep breath spake and said, “Madam, what slender opinion\r\nsoever thou hast held of us of Witchland, I pray thee be satisfied that\r\nI and my kinsman have sought to thee now with a clean heart to do thee\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\n“Princes,” said she, “scarce might ye blame me did I misdoubt you.\r\nYet, seeing that my life’s days have been not among ambidexters and\r\nconey-catchers but lovers of clean hands and open dealing, not even\r\nafter that which I this night endured will mine heart believe that all\r\ncivility is worn away in Witchland. Did I not freely receive Corinius’s\r\nself when I did open my gates to him, firmly believing him to be a king\r\nand not a ravening wolf?”\r\n\r\nThen said Heming, “Canst thou wear armour, madam? Thou art something\r\nof an height with my brother. To bring thee past the guard, if thou go\r\narmed, as I shall conduct thee, the wine they have drunken shall be thy\r\nminister. I have provided an horse. In the likeness of my young brother\r\nmayst thou ride forth to-night out of this castle, and win clean away.\r\nBut in thine own shape thou mayst never pass from these thy lodgings,\r\nfor he hath set a guard thereon; being resolved, come thereof what may,\r\nto visit thee here this night: in thine own chamber, madam.”\r\n\r\nThe sounds of furious revelry floated up from the banquet chamber.\r\nMevrian heard by snatches the voice of Corinius singing an unseemly\r\nsong. As in the presence of some dark influence that threatened an ill\r\nshe might not comprehend, yet felt her blood quail and her heart grow\r\nsick because of it, she looked on those brethren.\r\n\r\nShe said at last, “Was this your plan?”\r\n\r\nHeming answered, “It was the Lord Gro did most ingenuously conceive it.\r\nBut Corinius, as he hath ever held him in distrust, and most of all\r\nwhen he hath drunken overmuch, keepeth him most firmly at his elbow.”\r\n\r\nCargo now did off his armour, and Mevrian calling in her women to take\r\nthis and other gear fared straightway to an inner chamber to change her\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nHeming said to his brother, “Thou shalt need to go about it with\r\ngreat circumspection, to come off when we are gone so as thou be not\r\naspied. Were I thou, I should be tempted for the rareness of the jest\r\nto await his coming, and assay whether thou couldst not make as good a\r\ncounterfeit Mevrian as she a counterfeit Cargo.”\r\n\r\n“Thou,” said Cargo, “mayst well laugh and be gay, thou that must\r\nconduct her. And art resolved, I dare lay my head to a turnip, to do\r\nthy utmost endeavour to despoil Corinius of that felicity he hath\r\nto-night decreed him, and bless thyself therewith.”\r\n\r\n“Thou hast fallen,” answered Heming, “into a most barbarous thought.\r\nShall my tongue be so false a traitor to mine heart as to say I love\r\nnot this lady? Compare but her beauty and my youth together, how should\r\nit other be? But with such a height of fervour I do love her that I’d\r\nas lief offer violence to a star of heaven, as require of her aught but\r\nhonest.”\r\n\r\nSaid Cargo, “What said the wise little boy to’s elder brother? ‘Sith\r\nthou’st gotten the cake, brother, I must e’en make shift with the\r\ncrumbs.’ When you are gone, and all whisht and quiet, and I left here\r\namid the waiting women, it shall go hard but I’ll teach ’em somewhat\r\nafore good-night.”\r\n\r\nNow opened the door of the inner chamber, and there stood before them\r\nthe Lady Mevrian armed and helmed. She said, “’Tis no light matter to\r\nhalt before a cripple. Think you this will pass i’ the dark, my lords?”\r\n\r\nThey answered, ’twas beyond all commendation excellent.\r\n\r\n“I’ll thank thee now, Prince Cargo,” said she, stretching out her\r\nhand. He bowed and kissed it in silence. “This harness,” she said,\r\n“shall be a keepsake unto me of a noble enemy. Would someday I might\r\ncall thee friend, for suchwise hast thou borne thee this night.”\r\n\r\nTherewith, bidding young Cargo adieu, she with his brother went forth\r\nfrom the chamber and through the ante-chamber to that shadowy stairway\r\nwhere Corinius’s soldiers stood sentinel. These (as many more be\r\ndrowned in the beaker than in the ocean), not over-heedful after their\r\ntipplings, seeing two go by together with clanking armour and knowing\r\nHeming’s voice when he answered the challenge, made no question but\r\nhere were Corund’s sons returning to the banquet.\r\n\r\nSo passed he and she lightly by the sentinels. But as they fared by\r\nthe lofty corridor without the Chamber of the Moon, the doors of that\r\nchamber opening suddenly left and right there came forth torch-bearers\r\nand minstrels two by two as in a progress, with cymbals clashing and\r\nflutes and tambourines, so that the corridor was fulfilled with the\r\nflare of flamboys and the din. In the midst walked the Lord Corinius.\r\nThe lusty blood within him burned scarlet in all his shining face, and\r\nmade stand the veins like cords on the strong neck and arms and hands\r\nof him. The thick curls above his brow where they strayed below his\r\ncoronal of sleeping nightshade were a-drip with sweat. Plain it was he\r\nwas in no good trim, after that shrewd knock on the head Astar that day\r\nhad given him, to withstand deep quaffings. He went between Gro and\r\nLaxus, swaying heavily now on the arm of this one now of the other, his\r\nright hand beating time to the music of the bridal song.\r\n\r\nMevrian whispered to Heming, “Let us bear out a good face so long as we\r\nbe alive.”\r\n\r\nThey stood aside, hoping to be passed by unnoticed, for retreat nor\r\nconcealment was there none. But Corinius his eye lighting on them\r\nstopped and hailed them, catching them each by an arm, and crying,\r\n“Heming, thou’rt drunk! Cargo, thou’rt drunk, sweet youth! ’Tis a\r\ndamnable folly, drink as drunk as you be, and these bonny wenches\r\nI’ve provided you. How shall I satisfy ’em, think ye, when they come\r\nto me with their plaints to-morn, that each must sit with a snoring\r\ndrunkard’s head in her lap the night long?”\r\n\r\nMevrian, as if she had all her part by rote, was leaned this while\r\nheavily upon Heming, hanging her head.\r\n\r\nHeming could think on nought likelier to say, than, “Truly, O Corinius,\r\nwe be sober.”\r\n\r\n“Thou liest,” said Corinius. “’Twas ever sign manifest of drunkenness\r\nto deny it. Look you, my lords, I deny not I am drunk. Therefore is\r\nsign manifest I am drunk, I mean, sign manifest I am sober. But the\r\nhour calleth to other work than questioning of these high matters. Set\r\non!”\r\n\r\nSo speaking he reeled heavily against Gro, and (as if moved by some\r\nairy influence that, whispering him of schemings afoot, yet conspired\r\nwith the wine that he had drunken to make him look all otherwhere for\r\ntreason than where it lay under his hand to discover it) gripped Gro by\r\nthe arm, saying, “Bide by me, Goblin, thou wert best. I do love thee\r\nvery discreetly, and will still hold thee by the ears, to see thou bite\r\nme not, nor go no more a-gadding.”\r\n\r\nBeing by such happy fortune delivered out of this peril, Heming and\r\nMevrian with what prudent haste they might, and without mishap or\r\nhindrance, got them their horses and fared forth of the main gate\r\nbetween the marble hippogriffs, whose mighty forms shone above them\r\nstark in the low beams of the rising moon. So they rode silently\r\nthrough the gardens and the home-meads and thence to the wild woods\r\nbeyond, quickening now their pace to a gallop on the yielding turf. So\r\nhard they rode, the air of the windless April night was lashed into\r\nstorm about their faces. The trample and thunder of hoof-beats and the\r\nflying glimpses of the trees were to young Heming but an undertone to\r\nthe thunder of his blood which night and speed and that lady galloping\r\nbeside him knee to knee set a-gallop within him. But to Mevrian’s soul,\r\nas she galloped along those woodland rides, those moonlight glades,\r\nthese things and night and the steadfast stars attuned a heavenlier\r\nmusic; so that she waxed momently wondrous peaceful at heart, as with\r\nthe most firm assurance that not without the abiding glory of Demonland\r\nmust the great mutations of the world be acted, and but for a little\r\nshould their evil-willers usurp her dear brother’s seat in Krothering.\r\n\r\nThey drew rein in a clearing beside a broad stretch of water.\r\nPine-woods rose from its further edge, shadowy in the moonshine.\r\nMevrian rode to a little eminence that stood above the water and turned\r\nher eyes toward Krothering. Save by her instructed and loving eye\r\nscarce might it be seen, many miles away be-east of them, dimmed in\r\nthe obscure soft radiance under the moon. So sat she awhile looking on\r\ngolden Krothering, while her horse grazed quietly, and Heming at her\r\nelbow held his peace, only beholding her.\r\n\r\nAt last, looking back and meeting his gaze, “Prince Heming,” she said,\r\n“from this place goeth a hidden path north-about beside the firth, and\r\na dry road over the marsh, and a ford and an upland horse-way leadeth\r\ninto Westmark. Here and all-wheres in Demonland I might fare blindfold.\r\nAnd here I’ll say farewell. My tongue is a poor orator. But I mind me\r\nof the words of the poet where he saith:\r\n\r\n    My mind is like to the asbeston stone,\r\n    Which if it once be heat in flames of fire,\r\n    Denieth to becomen cold again.\r\n\r\nBe the latter issue of these wars in my great kinsmen’s victory, as I\r\nmost firmly trow it shall be, or in Gorice’s his, I shall not forget\r\nthis experiment of your nobility manifested unto me this night.”\r\n\r\nBut Heming, still beholding her, answered not a word.\r\n\r\nShe said, “How fares the Queen thy step-mother? Seven summers ago this\r\nsummer I was in Norvasp at Lord Corund’s wedding feast, and stood by\r\nher at the bridal. Is she yet so fair?”\r\n\r\nHe answered, “Madam, as June bringeth the golden rose unto perfection,\r\nso waxeth her beauty with the years.”\r\n\r\n“She and I,” said Mevrian, “were playmates, she the elder by two\r\nsummers. Is she yet so masterful?”\r\n\r\n“Madam, she is a Queen,” said Heming, nailing his very eyes on Mevrian.\r\nHer face half turned towards him, sweet mouth half closed, clear eyes\r\nuplifted toward the east, showed dim in the glamour of the moon, and\r\nthe lilt of her body was as a lily fallen a-dreaming beside some\r\nenchanted lake at midnight. With a dry throat he said, “Lady, until\r\nto-night I had not supposed there lived on earth a woman more beautiful\r\nthan she.”\r\n\r\nTherewith the love that was in him went like a wind and like an\r\nup-swooping darkness athwart his brain. As one who has too long,\r\nunbold, unresolved, delayed to lift that door’s latch which must open\r\non his heart’s true home, he caught his arms about her. Her cheek was\r\nsoft to his kiss, but deadly cold: her eyes like a wild bird’s caught\r\nin a purse-net. His brother’s armour that cased her body was not so\r\ndead nor so hard under his hand, as to his love that yielding cheek,\r\nthat alien look. He said, as one a-stagger for his wits in the presence\r\nof some unlooked-for chance, “Thou dost not love me?”\r\n\r\nMevrian shook her head, putting him gently away.\r\n\r\nLike the passing of a fire on a dry heath in summer the flame of his\r\npassion was passed by, leaving but a smouldering desolation of scornful\r\nsullen wrath: wrath at himself and fate.\r\n\r\nHe said, in a low shamed voice, “I pray you forgive me, madam.”\r\n\r\nMevrian said, “Prince, the Gods give thee good-night. Be kind to\r\nKrothering. I have left there an evil steward.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, she reined up her horse’s head and turned down westward\r\ntowards the firth. Heming watched her an instant, his brain a-reel.\r\nThen, striking spurs to his horse’s flanks so that the horse reared and\r\nplunged, he rode away at a great pace east again through the woods to\r\nKrothering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  XXV: LORD GRO AND THE LADY MEVRIAN\r\n\r\n  HOW THE LORD GRO, CONDUCTED BY A STRANGE ENAMOURMENT WITH LOST\r\n      CAUSES, FARED WITH NONE SAVE THIS TO BE HIS GUIDE INTO THE\r\n      REGIONS OF NEVERDALE, AND THERE BEHELD WONDERS, AND TASTED\r\n      AGAIN FOR A SEASON THE GOODNESS OF THOSE THINGS HE DID MOST\r\n      DESIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNinety days and a day after these doings aforesaid, in the last hour\r\nbefore the dawn, was the Lord Gro a-riding toward the paling east down\r\nfrom the hills of Eastmark to the fords of Mardardale. At a walking\r\npace his horse came down to the water-side, and halted with fetlocks\r\nawash: his flanks were wet and his wind gone, as from swift faring on\r\nthe open fell since midnight. He stretched down his neck, sniffed the\r\nfresh river-water, and drank. Gro turned in the saddle, listening, his\r\nleft hand thrown forward to slack the reins, his right flat-planted on\r\nthe crupper. But nought there was to hear save the babble of waters in\r\nthe shallows, the sucking noise of the horse drinking, and the plash\r\nand crunch of his hooves when he shifted feet among the pebbles. Before\r\nand behind and on either hand the woods and strath and circling hills\r\nshowed dim in the obscure gray betwixt darkness and twilight. A light\r\nmist hid the stars. Nought stirred save an owl that flitted like a\r\nphantom out from a holly-bush in a craggy bluff a bow-shot or more down\r\nstream, crossing Gro’s path and lighting on a branch of a dead tree\r\nabove him on the left, where she sat as if to observe the goings of\r\nthis man and horse that trespassed in this valley of quiet night.\r\n\r\nGro leaned forward to pat his horse’s neck. “Come, gossip, we must on,”\r\nhe said; “and marvel not if thou find no rest, going with me which\r\ncould never find any steadfast stay under the moon’s globe.” So they\r\nforded that river, and fared through low rough grass-lands beyond, and\r\nby the skirts of a wood up to an open heath, and so a mile or two,\r\nstill eastward, till they turned to the right down a broad valley and\r\ncrossed a river above a watersmeet, and so east again up the bed of\r\na stony stream and over this to a rough mountain track that crossed\r\nsome boggy ground and then climbed higher and higher above the floor\r\nof the narrowing valley to a pass between the hills. At length the\r\nslope slackened, and they passing, as through a gateway, between two\r\nhigh mountains which impended sheer and stark on either hand, came\r\nforth upon a moor of ling and bog-myrtle, strewn with lakelets and\r\nabounding in streams and moss-hags and outcrops of the living rock; and\r\nthe mountain peaks afar stood round that moorland waste like warrior\r\nkings. Now was colour waking in the eastern heavens, the bright shining\r\nmorning beginning to clear the earth. Conies scurried to cover before\r\nthe horse’s feet: small birds flew up from the heather: some red deer\r\nstood at gaze in the fern, then tripped away southward: a moorcock\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nGro said in himself, “How shall not common opinion account me mad,\r\nso rash and presumptuous dangerously to put my life in hazard? Nay,\r\nagainst all sound judgement; and this folly I enact in that very\r\nseason when by patience and courage and my politic wisdom I had won\r\nthat in despite of fortune’s teeth which obstinately hitherto she\r\nhad denied me: when after the brunts of divers tragical fortunes I\r\nhad marvellously gained the favour and grace of the King, who very\r\nhonourably placed me in his court, and tendereth me, I well think, so\r\ndearly as he doth the balls of his two eyes.”\r\n\r\nHe put off his helm, baring his white forehead and smooth black curling\r\nlocks to the airs of morning, flinging back his head to drink deep\r\nthrough his nostrils the sweet strong air and its peaty smell. “Yet\r\nis common opinion the fool, not I,” he said. “He that imagineth after\r\nhis labours to attain unto lasting joy, as well may he beat water in\r\na mortar. Is there not in the wild benefit of nature instances enow\r\nto laugh this folly out of fashion? A fable of great men that arise\r\nand conquer the nations: Day goeth up against the tyrant night. How\r\ndelicate a spirit is she, how like a fawn she footeth it upon the\r\nmountains: pale pitiful light matched with the primaeval dark. But\r\nevery sweet hovers in her battalions, and every heavenly influence:\r\ncoolth of the wayward little winds of morning, flowers awakening,\r\nbirds a-carol, dews a-sparkle on the fine-drawn webs the tiny spinners\r\nhang from fern-frond to thorn, from thorn to wet dainty leaf of the\r\nsilver birch; the young day laughing in her strength, wild with her own\r\nbeauty; fire and life and every scent and colour born anew to triumph\r\nover chaos and slow darkness and the kinless night.\r\n\r\n“But because day at her dawning hours hath so bewitched me, must I yet\r\nlove her when glutted with triumph she settles to garish noon? Rather\r\nturn as now I turn to Demonland, in the sad sunset of her pride. And\r\nwho dares call me turncoat, who do but follow now as I have followed\r\nthis rare wisdom all my days: to love the sunrise and the sundown and\r\nthe morning and the evening star? since there only abideth the soul of\r\nnobility, true love, and wonder, and the glory of hope and fear.”\r\n\r\nSo brooding he rode at an easy pace bearing east and a little north\r\nacross the moor, falling because of the strange harmony that was\r\nbetween outward things and the inward thoughts of his heart into a deep\r\nstudy. So came he to the moor’s end, and entered among the skirts of\r\nthe mountains beyond, crossing low passes, threading a way among woods\r\nand water-courses, up and down, about and about. The horse led him\r\nwhich way that he would, for no heed nor advice had he of aught about\r\nhim, for cause of the deep contemplation that he had within himself.\r\n\r\nIt was now high noon. The horse and his rider were come to a little\r\ndell of green grass with a beck winding in the midst with cool water\r\nflowing over a bed of shingle. About the dell grew many trees both tall\r\nand straight. Above the trees high mountain crags a-bake in the sun\r\nshowed ethereal through the shimmering heat. A murmur of waters, a hum\r\nof tiny wings flitting from flower to flower, the sound of the horse\r\ngrazing on the lush pasture: there was nought else to hear. Not a leaf\r\nmoved, not a bird. The hush of the summer noon-day, breathless, burnt\r\nthrough with the sun, more awful than any shape of night, paused above\r\nthat lonely dell.\r\n\r\nGro, as if waked by the very silence, looked quickly about him. The\r\nhorse felt belike in his bones his rider’s unease; he gave over his\r\nfeeding and stood alert with wild eye and quivering flanks. Gro patted\r\nand made much of him; then, guided by some inward prompting the reason\r\nwhereof he knew not, turned west by a small tributary beck and rode\r\nsoftly toward the wood. Here he was stopped with a number of trees\r\nso thickly placed together that he was afraid he should with riding\r\nthrough be swept from the saddle. So he lighted down, tied his horse\r\nto an oak, and climbed the bed of the little stream till he was come\r\nwhence he might look north over the tree-tops to a green terrace about\r\nat a level with him and some fifty paces distant along the hillside,\r\nshielded from the north by three or four great rowan trees on the far\r\nside of it, and on the terrace a little tarn or rock cistern of fair\r\nwater very cool and deep.\r\n\r\nHe paused, steadying himself with his left hand by a jutting rock\r\novergrown with rose-campion. Surely no children of men were these,\r\nfooting it on that secret lawn beside that fountain’s brink, nor no\r\ncreatures of mortal kind. Such it may be were the goats and kids and\r\nsoft-eyed does that on their hind-legs merrily danced among them;\r\nbut never such those others of manly shape and with pointed hairy\r\nears, shaggy legs, and cloven hooves, nor those maidens white of limb\r\nbeneath the tread of whose feet the blue gentian and the little golden\r\ncinquefoil bent not their blossoms, so airy-light was their dancing.\r\nTo make them music, little goat-footed children with long pointed ears\r\nsat on a hummock of turf-clad rock piping on pan-pipes, their bodies\r\nburnt to the hue of red earth by the wind and the sun. But, whether\r\nbecause their music was too fine for mortal ears, or for some other\r\nreason, Gro might hear no sound of that piping. The heavy silence of\r\nthe waste white noon was lord of the scene, while the mountain nymphs\r\nand the simple genii of sedge and stream and crag and moorland solitude\r\nthreaded the mazes of the dance.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Gro stood still in great admiration, saying in himself, “What\r\nmeans my drowsy head to dream such fancies? Spirits of ill have I\r\nheretofore beheld in their manifestations; I have seen fantasticoes\r\nframed and presented by art magic; I have dreamed strange dreams\r\na-nights. But till this hour I did account it an idle tale of poets’\r\nfaining, that amid woods, forests, fertile fields, sea-coasts, shores\r\nof great rivers and fountain brinks, and also upon the tops of huge\r\nand high mountains, do still appear unto certain favoured eyes the\r\nsundry-sorted nymphs and fieldish demigods. Which thing if I now\r\nverily behold, ’tis a great marvel, and sorteth well with the strange\r\nallurements whereby this oppressed land hath so lately found a means\r\nto govern mine affections.” And he thought awhile, reasoning thus in\r\nhis mind: “If this be but an apparition, it hath no essence to do me\r\na hurt. If o’ the contrary these be very essential beings, needs must\r\nthey joyfully welcome me and use me well, being themselves the true\r\nvital spirits of many-mountained Demonland; unto whose comfort and the\r\nrestorement of her old renown and praise I have with such a strange\r\ndetermination bent all my painful thoughts and resolution.”\r\n\r\nSo on the motion he discovered himself and hailed them. The wild things\r\nbounded away and were lost among the flanks of the hill. The capripeds,\r\nleaving on the instant their piping or their dancing, crouched watching\r\nhim with distrustful startled eyes. Only the Oreads still in a dazzling\r\ndrift pursued their round: quiet maiden mouths, beautiful breasts,\r\nslender lithe limbs, hand joined to delicate hand, parting and closing\r\nand parting again, in rhythms of unstaled variety; here one that,\r\nwith white arms clasped behind her head where her braided hair was\r\nas burnished gold, circled and swayed with a languorous motion; here\r\nanother, that leaped and paused hovering a-tiptoe, like an arrow of the\r\nsun shot through the leafy roof of an old pine-forest when the warm\r\nhill-wind stirs the tree-tops and opens a tiny window to the sky.\r\n\r\nGro went toward them along the grassy hillside. When he was come a\r\ndozen paces the strength was gone from his limbs. He kneeled down\r\ncrying out and saying, “Divinities of earth! deny me not, neither\r\nreject me, albeit cruelly have I till now oppressed your land, but will\r\ndo so no more. The footsteps of mine overtrodden virtue lie still as\r\nbitter accusations unto me. Bring me of your mercy where I may find out\r\nthem that possessed this land and offer them atonement, who were driven\r\nforth because of me and mine to be outlaws in the woods and mountains.”\r\n\r\nSo spake he, bowing his head in sorrow. And he heard, like the\r\ntrembling of a silver lute-string, a voice in the air that cried:\r\n\r\n    North ’tis and north ’tis!\r\n    Why need we further?\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes. The vision was gone. Only the noon and the\r\nwoodland, silent, solitary, dazzling, were about and above him.\r\n\r\nLord Gro came now to his horse again, and mounted and rode northaway\r\nthrough the fells all that summer afternoon, full of cloudy fancies.\r\nWhen it was eventide his way was high up along the steep side of\r\na mountain between the screes and the grass, following a little\r\npath made by the wild sheep. Far beneath in the valley was a small\r\nriver tortuously flowing along a bouldery bed amid hillocks of old\r\nmoraines which were like waves of a sea of grass-clad earth. The\r\nJuly sun wheeled low, flinging the shadows of the hills far up the\r\nwestward-facing slopes where Gro was a-riding, but where he rode and\r\nabove him the hillside was yet aglow with the warm low sunshine; and\r\nthe distant peak that shut in the head of the valley, rearing his huge\r\nfront like the gable of a house, with sweeping ribs of bare rock and\r\nscree and a crest of crag like a great breaker frozen to stone in mid\r\ncareer, bathed yet in a radiance of opalescent light.\r\n\r\nTurning the shoulder of the hillside at a place where the hill was\r\ncut by a shallow gully, he saw before him a hollow or sheltered nook.\r\nThere, protected by the great body of the hill from the blasts of the\r\neast and north, two rowan trees and some hollies grew in the clefts\r\nof the rock above the watercourse. Under their shadow was a cave,\r\nnot large but so big as a man might well abide in and be dry in wild\r\nweather, and beyond it on the right a little waterfall, so beautiful\r\nit was a wonder to behold. This was the fashion of it: a slab of rock,\r\ntwice a man’s height, tilted a little forward from the hill, so that\r\nthe water fell clear from its upper edge in a thin stream into a rocky\r\nbasin. The water in the basin was clear and deep, but a-churn always\r\nwith bubbles from the plunging jet from above; and over all the rocks\r\nabout it grew mosses and lichens and little water-flowers, nourished by\r\nthe stream at root and refreshed by the spray.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Gro said in his heart, “Here would I dwell for ever had I but\r\nthe art to make myself little as an eft. And I would build me an house\r\na span high beside yonder cushion of moss emerald-hued, with those pink\r\nfoxgloves to shade my door which balance their bells above the foaming\r\nwaters. This shy grass of Parnassus should be my drinking cup, with\r\npure white chalice poised on a hair-thin stem; and the curtains of my\r\nbed that little thirsty sandwort which, like a green heaven sown with\r\nmilk-white stars, curtains the shady sides of these rocks.”\r\n\r\nResting in this imagination he abode long time looking on that fairy\r\nplace, so secretly bestowed in the fold of the naked mountain. Then,\r\nunwilling to depart from so fair a spot, and bethinking him, besides,\r\nthat after so many hours his horse was weary, he dismounted and lay\r\ndown beside the stream. And in a short while, having his spirits\r\nsublimed with the sweet imagination of those wonders he had beheld, he\r\nwas fain to suffer the long dark lashes to droop over his large and\r\nliquid eyes. And deep sleep overcame him.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, all the sky was afire with the red of sunset. A shadow\r\nwas betwixt him and the western light: the shape of one bending over\r\nhim and saying in masterful wise, yet in accents wherein the echoes\r\nand memories of all sweet sounds seemed mingled and laid up at rest\r\nfor ever, “Lie still, my lord, nor cry not a rescue. Behold, thine own\r\nsword; and I took it from thee sleeping.” And he was ware of a sharp\r\nsword pointed against his throat where the big veins lie beneath the\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nHe stirred not at all, neither spake aught, only looking up at her as\r\nat some vision of delight strayed from the fugitive flock of dreams.\r\n\r\nThe lady said, “Where be thy company? And how many? Answer me swiftly.”\r\n\r\nHe answered her like a dreamer, “How shall I answer thee? How shall I\r\nnumber them that be beyond all count? Or how name unto your grace their\r\nhabitation which are even very now closer to me than hand or feet, yet\r\no’ the next instant are able to transcend a main wider belike than even\r\na starbeam hath journeyed o’er?”\r\n\r\nShe said, “Riddle me no riddles. Answer me, thou wert best.”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” said Gro, “these that I told thee of be the company of mine\r\nown silent thoughts. And, but for mine horse, this is all the company\r\nthat came hither with me.”\r\n\r\n“Alone?” said she. “And sleep so securely in thine enemies’ country?\r\nThat showed a strange confidence.”\r\n\r\n“Not enemies, if I may,” said he.\r\n\r\nBut she cried, “And thou Lord Gro of Witchland?”\r\n\r\n“That one sickened long since,” he answered, “of a mortal sickness; and\r\n’tis now a day and a night since he is dead thereof.”\r\n\r\n“What art thou, then?” said she.\r\n\r\nHe answered, “If your grace would so receive me, Lord Gro of Demonland.”\r\n\r\n“A very practised turncoat,” said she. “Belike they also are wearied\r\nof thee and thy ways. Alas,” she said in an altered voice, “thy gentle\r\npardon! when doubtless it was for thy generous deeds to me-ward they\r\nfell out with thee, when thou didst so nobly befriend me.”\r\n\r\n“I will tell your highness,” answered he, “the pure truth. Never stood\r\nmatters better ’twixt me and all of them than when yesternight I\r\nresolved to leave them.”\r\n\r\nThe Lady Mevrian was silent, a cloud in her face. Then, “I am alone,”\r\nshe said. “Therefore think it not little-hearted in me, nor forgetful\r\nof past benefits, if I will be further certified of thee ere I suffer\r\nthee to rise. Swear to me thou wilt not betray me.”\r\n\r\nBut Gro said, “How should an oath from me avail thee, madam? Oaths bind\r\nnot an ill man. Were I minded to do thee wrong, lightly should I swear\r\nthee all oaths thou mightest require, and lightly o’ the next instant\r\nbe forsworn.”\r\n\r\n“That is not well said,” said Mevrian. “Nor helpeth not thy safety. You\r\nmen do say that women’s hearts be faint and feeble, but I shall show\r\nthee the contrary is in me. Study to satisfy me. Else will I assuredly\r\nsmite thee to death with thine own sword.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Gro lay back, clasping his slender hands behind his head.\r\n“Stand, I pray thee,” said he, “o’ the other side of me, that I may see\r\nthy face.”\r\n\r\nShe did so, still threatening him with the sword. And he said smiling,\r\n“Divine lady, all my days have I had danger for my bedfellow, and\r\nperil of death for my familiar friend; whilom leading a delicate life\r\nin princely court, where murther sitteth in the wine-cup and in the\r\nalcove; whilom journeying alone in more perilous lands than this,\r\nas witness the Moruna, where the country is full of venomous beasts\r\nand crawling poisoned serpents, and the divels be as abundant there\r\nas grasshoppers on a hot hillside in summer. He that feareth is a\r\nslave, were he never so rich, were he never so powerful. But he that\r\nis without fear is king of all the world. Thou hast my sword. Strike.\r\nDeath shall be a sweet rest to me. Thraldom, not death, should terrify\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nShe paused awhile, then said unto him, “My Lord Gro, thou didst do me\r\nonce a right great good turn. Surely I may build my safety on this,\r\nthat never yet did kite bring forth a good flying hawk.” She shifted\r\nher hold on his sword, and very prettily gave it him hilt-foremost,\r\nsaying, “I give it thee back, my lord, nothing doubting that that which\r\nwas given in honour thou wilt honourably use.”\r\n\r\nBut he, rising up, said, “Madam, this and thy noble words hath given\r\nsuch rootfastness to the pact of faith betwixt us that it may now\r\nunfold what blossom of oaths thou wilt; for oaths are the blossom of\r\nfriendship, not the root. And thou shalt find me a true holder of my\r\nvowed amity unto thee without spot or wrinkle.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nFor sundry nights and days abode Gro and Mevrian in that place, hunting\r\nat whiles to get their sustenance, drinking of the sweet spring-water,\r\nsleeping a-nights she in her cave beneath the holly bushes and the\r\nrowans beside the waterfall, he in a cleft of the rocks a little below\r\nin the gully, where the moss made cushions soft and resilient as the\r\ngreat stuffed beds in Carcë. In those days she told him of her farings\r\nsince that night of April when she escaped out of Krothering: how\r\nfirst she found harbourage at By in Westmark, but hearing in a day or\r\ntwo of a hue and cry fled east again, and sojourning awhile beside\r\nThrowater came at length about a month ago upon this cave beside the\r\nlittle fountain, and here abode. Her mind had been to win over the\r\nmountains to Galing, but she had after the first attempt given over\r\nthat design, for fear of companies of the enemy whose hands she barely\r\nescaped when she came forth into the lower valleys that open on the\r\neastern coast-lands. So she had turned again to this hiding place in\r\nthe hills, as secret and remote as any in Demonland. For this dale she\r\nlet him know was Neverdale, where no road ran save the way of the deer\r\nand the mountain goats, and no garth opened on that dale, and the reek\r\nof no man’s hearthstone burdened the winds that blew thither. And that\r\ngable-crested peak at the head of the dale was the southernmost of\r\nthe Forks of Nantreganon, nursery of the vulture and the eagle. And a\r\nhidden way was round the right shoulder of that peak, over the toothed\r\nridge by Neverdale Hause to the upper waters of Tivarandardale.\r\n\r\nOn an afternoon of sultry summer heat it so befell that they rested\r\nbelow the hause on a bastion of rock that jutted from the south-western\r\nslope. Beneath their feet precipices fell suddenly away from a giddy\r\nverge, sweeping round in a grand cirque above which the mountain rose\r\nlike some Tartarian fortress, ponderous, cruel as the sea and sad,\r\nscarred and gashed with great lines of cleavage as though the face of\r\nthe mountain had been slashed away by the axe-stroke of a giant. In the\r\ndepths the waters of Dule Tarn slept placid and fathomless.\r\n\r\nGro was stretched on the brink of the cliff, face downward, propped\r\non his two elbows, studying those dark waters. “Surely,” he said,\r\n“the great mountains of the world are a present remedy if men did but\r\nknow it against our modern discontent and ambitions. In the hills is\r\nwisdom’s fount. They are deep in time. They know the ways of the sun\r\nand the wind, the lightning’s fiery feet, the frost that shattereth,\r\nthe rain that shroudeth, the snow that putteth about their nakedness\r\na softer coverlet than fine lawn: which if their large philosophy\r\nquestion not if it be a bridal sheet or a shroud, hath not this\r\nunpolicied calm his justification ever in the returning year, and is it\r\nnot an instance to laugh our carefulness out of fashion? of us, little\r\nchildren of the dust, children of a day, who with so many burdens do\r\nburden us with taking thought and with fears and desires and devious\r\nschemings of the mind, so that we wax old before our time and fall\r\nweary ere the brief day be spent and one reaping-hook gather us home at\r\nlast for all our pains.”\r\n\r\nHe looked up and she met the gaze of his great eyes; deep pools of\r\nnight they seemed, where strange matters might move unseen, disturbing\r\nto look on, yet filled with a soft slumbrous charm that lulled and\r\nsoothed.\r\n\r\n“Thou’st fallen a-dreaming, my lord,” said Mevrian. “And for me ’tis a\r\nhard thing to walk with thee in thy dreams, who am awake in the broad\r\ndaylight and would be a-doing.”\r\n\r\n“Certes it is an ill thing,” said Lord Gro, “that thou, who hast not\r\nbeen nourished in mendicity or poverty but in superfluity of honour and\r\nlargesse, shouldst be made fugitive in thine own dominions, to lodge\r\nwith foxes and beasts of the wild mountain.”\r\n\r\nSaid she, “It is yet a sweeter lodging than is to-day in Krothering.\r\nIt is therefore I chafe to do somewhat. To win through to Galing, that\r\nwere something.”\r\n\r\n“What profit is in Galing,” said Gro, “without Lord Juss?”\r\n\r\nShe answered, “Thou wilt tell me it is even as Krothering without my\r\nbrother.”\r\n\r\nLooking sidelong up at her, where she sat armed beside him, he beheld a\r\ntear a-tremble on her eyelid. He said gently, “Who shall foreknow the\r\nways of Fate? Your highness is better here belike.”\r\n\r\nLady Mevrian stood up. She pointed to a print in the living rock before\r\nher feet. “The hippogriff’s hoofmark!” she cried, “stricken in the\r\nrock ages ago by that high bird which presideth from of old over the\r\npredestined glory of our line, to point us on to a fame advanced above\r\nthe region of the glittering stars. True is the word that that land\r\nwhich is in the governance of a woman only is not surely kept. I will\r\nabide idly here no more.”\r\n\r\nGro, beholding her so stand all armed on that high brink of crag,\r\nsetting with so much perfection in womanly beauty manlike valour,\r\nbethought him that here was that true embodiment of morn and eve, that\r\ncharm which called him from Krothering, and for which the prophetic\r\nspirits of mountain and wood and field had pointed his path with a\r\nheavenly benison, meaning to bid him go northward to his heart’s\r\ntrue home. He kneeled down and caught her hand in his, embracing and\r\nkissing it as of her in whom all his hopes were placed, and saying\r\npassionately, “Mevrian, Mevrian, let me but be armed in thy good grace\r\nand I defy whatever there is or can be against me. Even as the sun\r\nlighteth broad heaven at noon-day, and that giveth light unto this\r\ndreary earth, so art thou the true light of Demonland which because of\r\nthee maketh the whole world glorious. Welcome unto me be all miseries,\r\nso only unto thee I may be welcome.”\r\n\r\nShe sprang back, snatching away her hand. Her sword leapt singing\r\nfrom the scabbard. But Gro, that was so ravished and abused that he\r\nremembered of nothing worldly but only that he beheld his lady’s face,\r\nabode motionless. She cried, “Back to back! Swift, or ’tis too late!”\r\n\r\nHe leaped up, barely in time. Six stout fellows, soldiers of Witchland\r\nstolen softly upon them at unawares, closed now upon them. No breath to\r\nwaste in parley, but the clank of steel: he and Mevrian back to back\r\non a table of rock, those six setting on from either side. “Kill the\r\nGoblin,” said they. “Take the lady unhurt: ’tis death to all if she be\r\ntouched.”\r\n\r\nSo for a time those two defended them of all their power. Yet at such\r\nodds could not the issue stand long in doubt, nor Gro’s high mettle\r\nmake up what he lacked of strength bodily and skill in arms. Cunning of\r\nfence indeed was the Lady Mevrian, as they guessed not to their hurt;\r\nfor the first of them, a great chuff-headed fellow that thought to bear\r\nher down with rushing in upon her, she with a deft thrust passing his\r\nguard ran clean through the throat; by whose taking off, his fellows\r\ntook some lesson of caution. But Gro being at length brought to earth\r\nwith many wounds, they had the next instant caught Mevrian from behind\r\nwhiles others engaged her in the face, when in the nick of time as by\r\nthe intervention of heaven was all their business taken in reverse, and\r\nall five in a moment laid bleeding on the stones beside their fellows.\r\n\r\nMevrian, looking about and seeing what she saw, fell weak and faint in\r\nher brother’s arms, overcome with so much radiant joy after that stress\r\nof action and peril; beholding now with her own eyes that home-coming\r\nwhereof the genii of that land had had foreknowledge and in Gro’s sight\r\nshown themselves wild with joy thereof: Brandoch Daha and Juss come\r\nhome to Demonland, like men arisen from the dead.\r\n\r\n“Not touched,” she answered them. “But look to my Lord Gro: I fear he\r\nbe hurt. Look to him well, for he hath approved him our friend indeed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  XXVI: THE BATTLE OF KROTHERING SIDE\r\n\r\n  HOW WORD WAS BROUGHT UNTO THE LORD CORINIUS THAT THE LORDS JUSS\r\n      AND BRANDOCH DAHA WERE COME AGAIN INTO THE LAND, AND HOW HE\r\n      RESOLVED TO GIVE THEM BATTLE ON THE SIDE, UNDER ERNGATE END;\r\n      AND OF THE GREAT FLANK MARCH OF LORD BRANDOCH DAHA OVER THE\r\n      MOUNTAINS FROM TRANSDALE; AND OF THE GREAT BATTLE, AND OF THE\r\n      ISSUE THEREOF.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaxus and those sons of Corund walked on an afternoon in Krothering\r\nhome mead. The sky above them was hot and coloured of lead, presaging\r\nthunder. No wind stirred in the trees that were livid-green against\r\nthat leaden pall. The noise of mattock and crow-bar came without\r\nintermission from the castle. Where gardens had been and arbours of\r\nshade and sweetness, was now but wreck: broken columns and smashed\r\nporphyry vases of rare workmanship, mounds of earth and rotting\r\nvegetation. And those great cedars, emblems of their lord’s estate and\r\npride, lay prostrate now with their roots exposed, a tangle of sere\r\nfoliage and branches broken, withered and lifeless. Over this death-bed\r\nof ruined loveliness the towers of onyx showed ghastly against the sky.\r\n\r\n“Is there not a virtue in seven?” said Cargo. “Last week was the sixth\r\ntime we thought we had gotten the eel by the tail in yon fly-blown\r\nhills of Mealand and came empty home. When think’st, Laxus, shall’s run\r\n’em to earth indeed?”\r\n\r\n“When egg-pies shall grow on apple-trees,” answered Laxus. “Nay, the\r\ngeneral setteth greater store by his proclamations concerning the young\r\nwoman (who likely never heareth of them, and assuredly will not be by\r\nthem ’ticed home again), and by these toys of revenge, than by sound\r\nsoldiership. Hark! there goeth this day’s work.”\r\n\r\nThey turned at a shout from the gates, to behold the northern of those\r\ntwo golden hippogriffs totter and crash down the steeps into the moat,\r\nsending up a great smoke from the stones and rubble which poured in its\r\nwake.\r\n\r\nLord Laxus’s brow was dark. He laid hand on Heming’s arm, saying, “The\r\ntimes need all sage counsel we can reach unto, O ye sons of Corund, if\r\nour Lord the King shall have indeed from this expedition into Demonland\r\nthe victory at last of all his evil-willers. Remember, that was a great\r\nmiss to our strength when the Goblin went.”\r\n\r\n“Out upon the viper!” said Cargo. “Corinius was right in this, not to\r\nwarrant him the honesty of such slippery cattle. He had not served\r\nabove a month or two, but that he ran to the enemy.”\r\n\r\n“Corinius,” said Laxus, “is yet but green in his estate. Doth he\r\nsuppose the rest of his reign shall be but play and the enjoying of\r\na kingdom? Those left-handed strokes of fortune may yet o’erthrow\r\nhim, the while that he streameth out his youth in wine and venery and\r\nmanageth his private spite against this lady. Slipper youth must be\r\nunder-propped with elder counsel, lest all go miss.”\r\n\r\n“A most reverend old counsellor art thou!” said Cargo; “of\r\nsix-and-thirty years of age.”\r\n\r\nSaid Heming, “We be three. Take command thyself. I and my brother will\r\nback thee.”\r\n\r\n“I will that thou swallow back those words,” said Laxus, “as though\r\nthey had never been spoke. Remember Corsus and Gallandus. Besides,\r\nalbeit he seemeth now rather to be a man straught than one that hath\r\nhis wits, yet is Corinius in his sober self a valiant and puissant\r\nsoldier, a politic and provident captain as is not found besides in\r\nDemonland, no, nor in Witchland neither, and it were not your noble\r\nfather; and this one in his youthly age.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” said Heming. “Thou hast justly reproved me.”\r\n\r\nNow while they were a-talking, came one from the castle and made\r\nobeisance unto Laxus saying, “You are inquired for, O king, so please\r\nyou to walk into the north chamber.”\r\n\r\nSaid Laxus, “Is it he that was newly ridden from the east country?”\r\n\r\n“So it is, so please you,” with a low leg he made answer.\r\n\r\n“Hath he not had audience with King Corinius?”\r\n\r\n“He hath sought audience,” said the man, “but was denied. The matter\r\npresseth, and he urged me therefore seek unto your lordship.”\r\n\r\nAs they walked toward the castle Heming said in Laxus’s ear, “Knowest\r\nthou not this brave new piece of court ceremony? O’ these days, when\r\nhe hath ’stroyed an hostage to spite the Lady Mevrian, as to-day was\r\n’stroyed the horse-headed eagle, he giveth not audience till sun-down.\r\nFor, the deed of vengeance done, a retireth himself to his own chamber\r\nand a wench with him, the daintiest and gamesomest he may procure;\r\nand so, for two hours or three drowned in the main sea of his own\r\npleasures, he abateth some little deal for a season the pang of love.”\r\n\r\nNow when Laxus was come forth from talking with the messenger from the\r\neast, he fared without delay to Corinius’s chamber. There, thrusting\r\naside the guards, he flung wide the shining doors, and found the Lord\r\nCorinius merrily disposed. He was reclined on a couch deep-cushioned\r\nwith dark green three-pile velvet. An ivory table inlaid with silver\r\nand ebony stood at his elbow bearing a crystal flagon already two parts\r\nemptied of the foaming wine, and a fair gold goblet beside it. He wore\r\na long loose sleeveless gown of white silk edged with a gold fringe;\r\nthis, fallen open at the neck, left naked his chest and one strong arm\r\nthat in that moment when Laxus entered reached out to grasp the wine\r\ncup. Upon his knee he held a damosel of some seventeen years, fair and\r\nfresh as a rose, with whom he was plainly on the point to pass from\r\nfriendly converse to amorous privacy. He looked angrily upon Laxus, who\r\nwithout ceremony spoke and said, “The whole east is in a tumult. The\r\nburg is forced which we built astride the Stile. Spitfire hath passed\r\ninto Breakingdale to victual Galing, and hath overthrown our army that\r\nsat in siege thereof.”\r\n\r\nCorinius drank a draught and spat. “Phrut!” said he. “Much bruit,\r\nlittle fruit. I would know by what warrant thou troublest me with\r\nthis tittle-tattle, and I pleasantly disposing myself to mirth and\r\nrecreation. Could it not wait till supper time?”\r\n\r\nEre Laxus might say more, was a great clatter heard without on the\r\nstairs, and in came those sons of Corund.\r\n\r\n“Am I a king?” said Corinius, gathering his robe about him, “and shall\r\nI be forced? Avoid the chamber.” Then marking them stand silent with\r\ndisordered looks, “What’s the matter?” he said. “Are ye ta’en with the\r\nswindle or the turn-sickness? Or are ye out of your wits?”\r\n\r\nHeming answered and said, “Not mad, my lord. Here’s Didarus that held\r\nthe Stile-burg for us, ridden from the east as fast as his horse might\r\nwallop, and gotten here hard o’ the heels of the former messenger with\r\nfresh and more certain advertisement, fresher by four days than that\r\none’s. I pray you hear him.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll hear him,” said Corinius, “at supper time. Nought sooner, if the\r\nroof were afire.”\r\n\r\n“The land beneath thy feet’s afire!” cried Heming. “Juss and Brandoch\r\nDaha home again, and half the country lost thee ere thou heard’st\r\non’t. These devils are home again! Shall we hear that and still be\r\nswill-bowls?”\r\n\r\nCorinius listened with folded arms. His great jaw was lifted up. His\r\nnostrils widened. For a minute he abode in silence, his cold blue eyes\r\nfixed as it were on somewhat afar. Then, “Home again?” said he. “And\r\nthe east in a hubbub? And not unlikely. Thank Didarus for his tidings.\r\nHe shall sweeten mine ears with some more at supper. Till then, leave\r\nme, unless ye mean to be stretched.”\r\n\r\nBut Laxus, with sad and serious brow, stood beside him and said, “My\r\nlord, forget not that you are here the vicar and legate of the King.\r\nLet the crown upon your head put perils in your thoughts, so as you may\r\nharken peaceably to them that are willing to lesson you with sound and\r\nsage advice. If we take order to-night to march by Switchwater, we may\r\nvery well shut back this danger and stifle it ere it wax to too much\r\nbigness. If o’ the contrary we suffer them to enter into these western\r\nparts, like enough without let or stay they will overrun the whole\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nCorinius rolled his eye upon him. “Can nothing,” he said, “prescribe\r\nunto thee obedience? Look to thine own charge. Is the fleet in proper\r\ntrim? For there’s the strength, ease, and anchor of our power, whether\r\nfor victualling, or to shift our weight against ’em which way we\r\nchoose, or to give us sure asylum if it were come to that. What ails\r\nthee? Have we not these four months desired nought better than that\r\nthese Demons should take heart to strike a field with us? If it be true\r\nthat Juss himself and Brandoch Daha have thrown down the castles and\r\nstrengths which I had i’ the east and move with an army against us, why\r\nthen I have them in the forge already, and shall now bring them to the\r\nhammer. And be satisfied, I’ll choose mine own ground to fight them.”\r\n\r\n“There’s yet matter for haste in this,” said Laxus. “A day’s march, and\r\nwe oppose ’em not, will bring them before Krothering.”\r\n\r\n“That,” answered Corinius, “jumpeth pat with mine own design. I’ll not\r\ngo a league to bar their way, but receive ’em here where the ground\r\nlieth most favourable to meet an enemy. Which advantage I’ll employ to\r\nthe greatest stretch of service, standing on Krothering Side, resting\r\nmy flank against the mountain. The fleet shall ride in Aurwath haven.”\r\n\r\nLaxus stroked his beard and was silent a minute, considering this. Then\r\nhe looked up and said, “This is sound generalship, I may not gainsay\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“It is a purpose, my lord,” said Corinius, “I have long had in myself,\r\nstored by for the event. Let me alone, therefore, to do that my right\r\nis. There’s this good in it, too, as it befalleth: ’twill suffer that\r\ndive-dapper to behold his home again afore I kill him. A shall find it\r\na sight for sore eyes, I think, after my tending on’t.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe third day after these doings, the farmer at Holt stood in his porch\r\nthat opened westward on Tivarandardale. An old man was he, crooked like\r\na mountain thorn. But a bright black eye he had, and the hair curled\r\ncrisp yet above his brow. It was late afternoon and the sky overcast.\r\nTousle-haired sheep-dogs slept before the door. Swallows gathered in\r\nthe sky. Near to him sat a damosel, dainty as a meadow-pipit, lithe as\r\nan antelope; and she was grinding grain in a hand-mill, singing the\r\nwhile:\r\n\r\n        Grind, mill, grind,\r\n        Corinius grinds us all;\r\n    Kinging it in widowed Krothering.\r\n\r\nThe old man was furbishing a shield and morion-cap, and other tackle of\r\nwar lay at his feet.\r\n\r\n“I wonder thou wilt still be busy with thy tackle, O my father,” said\r\nshe, looking up from her singing and grinding. “If ill tide ill again\r\nwhat should an old man do but grieve and be silent?”\r\n\r\n“There shall be time for that hereafter,” said the old man. “But a\r\nlittle while is hand fain of blow.”\r\n\r\n“They’ll be for firing the roof-tree, likely, if they come back,” said\r\nshe, still grinding.\r\n\r\n“Thou’rt a disobedient lass. If thou’dst but flit as I bade thee to the\r\nshiel-house up the dale, I’d force not a bean for their burnings.”\r\n\r\n“Let it burn,” said she, “if he be taken. What avail then for thee or\r\nfor me to be a-tarrying? Thou that art an old man and full of good\r\ndays, and I that will not be left so.”\r\n\r\nA great dog awoke beside her and shook himself, then drew near and laid\r\nhis nose in her lap, looking up at her with kind solemn eyes.\r\n\r\nThe old man said, “Thou’rt a disobedient lass, and but for thee, come\r\nsword, come fire, not a straw care I; knowing it shall be but a passing\r\nstorm, now that my Lord is home again.”\r\n\r\n“They took the land from Lord Spitfire,” said she.\r\n\r\n“Ay, hinny,” said the old man, “and thou shalt see my Lord shall take\r\nit back again.”\r\n\r\n“Ay?” said she. And still she ground and still she sang:\r\n\r\n    Grind, mill, grind,\r\n    Corinius grinds us all.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, “Hist!” said the old man, “was not that a horse-tread i’\r\nthe lane? Get thee within-doors till I know if all be friendly.” And\r\nhe stooped painfully to take up his weapon. Woefully it shook in his\r\nfeeble hand.\r\n\r\nBut she, as one that knew the step, heeding nought else, leapt up with\r\nface first red then pale then flushed again, and ran to the gate of\r\nthe garth. And the sheep-dogs bounded before her. There in the gate\r\nshe was met with a young man riding a weary horse. He was garbed like\r\na soldier, and horse and man were so bedraggled with mire and dust and\r\nall manner of defilement they were a sorry sight to see, and so jaded\r\nboth that scarce it seemed they had might to journey another furlong.\r\nThey halted within the gate, and all those dogs jumped up upon them,\r\nwhining and barking for joy.\r\n\r\nEre the soldier was well down from the saddle he had a sweet armful.\r\n“Softly, my heart,” said he, “my shoulder’s somewhat raw. Nay, ’tis\r\nnought to speak on. I’ve brought thee all my limbs home.”\r\n\r\n“Was there a battle?” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“Was there a battle, father?” cried he. “I’ll tell thee, Krothering\r\nSide is thicker with dead men slain than our garth with sheep i’ the\r\nshearing time.”\r\n\r\n“Alack and alack, ’tis a most horrid wound, dear,” said the girl. “Go\r\nin, and I’ll wash it and lay to it millefoil pounded with honey; ’tis\r\nmost sovran against pain and loss of blood, and drieth up the lips of\r\nthe wound and maketh whole thou’dst not credit how soon. Thou hast bled\r\nover-much, thou foolish one. And how couldst thou thrive without thy\r\nwife to tend thee?”\r\n\r\nThe farmer put an arm about him, saying, “Was the field ours, lad?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you all orderly, old man,” answered he, “but I must stable\r\nhim first,” and the horse nuzzled his breast. “And ye must ballast me\r\nfirst. God shield us, ’tis not a tale for an empty man to tell.”\r\n\r\n“’Las, father,” said the damosel, “have we not one sweet sippet i’ the\r\nmouth, that we hold him here once more? And, sweet or sour, let him\r\ntake his time to fetch us the next.”\r\n\r\nSo they washed his hurt and laid kindly herbs thereto, and bound\r\nit with clean linen, and put fresh raiment upon him, and made him\r\nsit on the bench without the porch and gave him to eat and drink:\r\ncakes of barley meal and dark heather-honey, and rough white wine of\r\nTivarandardale. The dogs lay close about him as if there was warmth\r\nthere and safety whereas he was. His young wife held his hand in hers,\r\nas if that were enough if it should last for aye. And that old man,\r\neating down his impatience like a schoolboy chafing for the bell,\r\nfingered his partisan with trembling hand.\r\n\r\n“Thou hadst the word I sent thee, father, after the fight below Galing?”\r\n\r\n“Ay. ’Twas good.”\r\n\r\n“There was a council held that night,” said the soldier. “All\r\nthe great men together in the high hall in Galing, so as it was a\r\nheaven to see. I was one of their cupbearers, ’cause I’d killed the\r\nstandard-bearer of the Witches, in that same battle below Galing.\r\nMethought ’twas no great thing I did; till after the battle, look\r\nyou, my Lord’s self standing beside me; and saith he, ‘Arnod’ (ay, by\r\nmy name, father), ‘Arnod,’ a saith, ‘thou’st done down the pennon o’\r\nWitchland that ’gainst our freedom streamed so proud. ’Tis thy like\r\nshall best stead Demonland i’ these dog-days,’ saith he. ‘Bear my cup\r\nto-night, for thine honour.’ I would, lass, thou’dst seen his eyes that\r\ntide. ’Tis a lord to put marrow in the sword-arm, our Lord.\r\n\r\n“They had forth the great map o’ the world, of this Demonland, to\r\nstudy their business. I was by, pouring the wine, and I heard their\r\ndisputations. ’Tis a wondrous map wrought in crystal and bronze, most\r\nartificial, with waters a-glistering and mountains standing substantial\r\nto the touch. My Lord points with’s sword. ‘Here,’ a saith, ‘standeth\r\nCorinius, by all sure tellings, and budgeth not from Krothering. And,\r\nby the Gods,’ a saith, ‘’tis a wise disposition. For, mark, if we\r\ngo by Gashterndale, as go we must to come at him, he striketh down\r\non us as hammer on anvil. And if we will pass by toward the head of\r\nThunderfirth,’ and here a pointeth it out with’s sword, ‘Down a cometh\r\non our flank; and every-gate the land’s slope serveth his turn and\r\nfighteth against us.’\r\n\r\n“I mind me o’ those words,” said the young man, “’cause my Lord\r\nBrandoch Daha laughed and said, ‘Are we grown so strange by our\r\ntravels, our own land fighteth o’ the opposite party? Let me study it\r\nagain.’\r\n\r\n“I filled his cup. Dear Gods, but I’d fill him a bowl of mine own\r\nheart’s blood if he required it of me, after our times together,\r\nfather. But more o’ that anon. The stoutest gentleman and captain\r\nwithout peer.\r\n\r\n“But Lord Spitfire, that was this while vaunting up and down the\r\nchamber, cried out and said, ‘’Twere folly to travel his road prepared\r\nus. Take him o’ that side he looketh least to see us: south through the\r\nmountains, and upon him in his rear up from Mardardale.’\r\n\r\n“‘Ah,’ saith my Lord, ‘and be pressed back into Murkdale Hags if\r\nwe miss of our first spring. ’Tis too perilous. ’Tis worse than\r\nGashterndale.’\r\n\r\n“So went it: a nay for every yea, and nought to please ’em. Till i’\r\nthe end my Lord Brandoch Daha, that had been long time busy with the\r\nmap, said: ‘Now that y’ have threshed the whole stack and found not the\r\nneedle, I will show you my rede, ’cause ye shall not say I counselled\r\nyou rashly.’\r\n\r\n“So they bade him say his rede. And he said unto my Lord, ‘Thou and\r\nour main power shall go by Switchwater Way. And let the whole land’s\r\nface blaze your coming before you. Ye shall lie to-morrow night in\r\nsome good fighting-stead whither it shall not be to his vantage to\r\nmove against you: haply in the old shielings above Wrenthwaite, or at\r\nany likely spot afore the road dippeth south into Gashterndale. But\r\nat point of day strike camp and go by Gashterndale and so up on to\r\nthe Side to do battle with him. So shall all fall out even as his own\r\nhopes and expectations do desire it. But I,’ saith my Lord Brandoch\r\nDaha, ‘with seven hundred chosen horse, will have fared by then clean\r\nalong the mountain ridge from Transdale even to Erngate End; so as when\r\nhe turneth all his battle northward down the Side to whelm you, there\r\nshall hang above the security of his flank and rear that which he ne’er\r\ndreamed on. If he support my charging of his flank at unawares, with\r\nyou in front to cope him, and he with so small an advantage upon us in\r\nstrength of men: if he stand that, why then, good-night! the Witches\r\nare our masters in arms, and we may off cap to ’em and strive no more\r\nto right us.’\r\n\r\n“So said my Lord Brandoch Daha. But all called him daft to think on’t.\r\nCarry an army a-horseback in so small time ’cross such curst ground?\r\nIt might not be. ‘Well,’ quoth he, ‘sith you count it not possible,\r\nso much the more shall he. Cautious counsels never will serve us this\r\ntide. Give me but my pick of man and horse to the number of seven\r\nhundred, and I’ll so set this masque you shall not desire a better\r\nmaster of the revels.’\r\n\r\n“So i’ the end he had his way. And past midnight they were at it, I\r\nwis, planning and studying.\r\n\r\n“At dawn was the whole army marshalled in the meadows below Moonmere,\r\nand my Lord spake among them and told us he was minded to march into\r\nthe west country and exterminate the Witches out of Demonland; and he\r\nbade any man that deemed he had now his fill of furious war and deemed\r\nit a sweeter thing to go home to his own place, say forth his mind\r\nwithout fear, and he would let him go, yea, and give him good gifts\r\nthereto, seeing that all had done manful service; but he would have\r\nno man in this enterprise who went not to it with his whole heart and\r\nmind.”\r\n\r\nThe damosel said, “I wis there was not a man would take that offer.”\r\n\r\n“There went up,” said the soldier, “such a shout, with such a stamping,\r\nand such a clashing together of weapons, the land shook with’t, and\r\nthe echoes rolled in the high corries of the Scarf like thunder, of\r\nthem shouting ‘Krothering!’ ‘Juss!’ ‘Brandoch Daha!’ ‘Lead us to\r\nKrothering!’ Without more ado was the stuff packed up, and ere noon\r\nwas the whole army gotten over the Stile. While we halted for daymeal\r\nhard by Blackwood in Amadardale, came my Lord Brandoch Daha a-riding\r\namong the ranks for to take his pick of seven hundred of our ablest\r\nhorse. Nor a would not commit this to his officer, but himself called\r\non each lad by name whenso he saw a likely one, and speered would a\r\nride with him. I trow he gat never a nay to that speering. My heart\r\nwas a-cold lest he’d o’erlook me, watching him ride by as jaunty as a\r\nking. But a reined in’s horse and saith, ‘Arnod, ’tis a bonny horse\r\nthou ridest. Could he carry thee to a swine-hunt down from Erngate End\r\ni’ the morning?’ I saluted him and said, ‘Not so far only, Lord, but to\r\nburning Hell so thou but lead us.’ ‘Come on,’ saith he. ‘’Tis a better\r\ngate I shall lead thee: to Krothering hall ere eventide.’\r\n\r\n“So now was our strength sundered, and the main army made ready to\r\nmarch westward down Switchwater Way; with the Lord Zigg to lead the\r\nhorse, and the Lord Volle and my Lord’s self and his brother the\r\nLord Spitfire faring in the midst amongst ’em all. And with them\r\nyonder outland traitor, Lord Gro; but I do think him more a stick of\r\nsugar-paste than a man of war. And many gentlemen of worth went with\r\nthem: Gismor Gleam of Justdale, Astar of Rettray, and Bremery of Shaws,\r\nand many more men of mark. But there abode with my Lord Brandoch Daha,\r\nArnund of By, and Tharmrod of Kenarvey, Kamerar of Stropardon, Emeron\r\nGalt, Hesper Golthring of Elmerstead, Styrkmir of Blackwood, Melchar\r\nof Strufey, Quazz’s three sons from Dalney, and Stypmar of Failze:\r\nfierce and choleric young gentlemen, after his own heart, methinks;\r\ngreat horsemen, not very forecasting of future things afar off but\r\nentertainers of fortune by the day; too rash to govern an army, but\r\nbest of all to obey and follow him in so glorious an enterprise.\r\n\r\n“Ere we parted, came my Lord to speak with my Lord Brandoch Daha. And\r\nmy Lord looked into the lift that was all dark cloud and wind; and\r\nquoth he, ‘Fail not at the tryst, cousin. ’Tis thy word, that thou and\r\nI be finger and thumb; and never more surely than to-morrow shall this\r\nbe seen.’\r\n\r\n“‘O friend of my heart, content thee,’ answereth my Lord Brandoch Daha.\r\n‘Didst ever know me neglect my guests? And have I not bidden you to\r\nbreakfast with me to-morrow morn in Krothering meads?’\r\n\r\n“Now we of the seven hundred turned leftward at the watersmeet up\r\nTransdale into the mountains. And now came ill weather upon us,\r\nthe worst that ever I knew. ’Tis soft enow and little road enow in\r\nTransdale, as thou knowest, father, and weary work it was with every\r\ndeer-track turned a water-course and underfoot all slush and mire, and\r\nnought for a man to see save white mist and rain above and about him,\r\nand soppy bent and water under’s horse-hooves. Little there was to tell\r\nus we were won at last to the top of the pass, and ’twere not the cloud\r\nblew thicker and the wind wilder about us. Every man was wet to the\r\nbreech, and bare a pint o’ water in’s two shoes.\r\n\r\n“Whiles we were halted on the Saddle my Lord Brandoch Daha rested not\r\nat all, but gave his horse to his man to hold and himself fared back\r\nand forth among us. And for every man he had a jest or a merry look,\r\nso as ’twas meat and drink but to hear or to behold him. But a little\r\nwhile only would he suffer us to halt; then right we turned, up along\r\nthe ridge, where the way was yet worse than in the dale had been, with\r\nrocks and pits hidden in the heather, and slithery slabs of granite.\r\nBy my faith, I think no horse that was not born and bred to’t might\r\ncross such country, wet or fine; he should be foundered or should\r\nbreak his legs and his rider’s neck ere he should be gotten two hours’\r\njourney along those ridges; but we that rode with my Lord Brandoch\r\nDaha to Krothering Side were ten hours riding so, besides our halts to\r\nwater our horses and longer halts to feed ’em, and the last part o’\r\nthe way through murk night, and all the way i’ the wind’s teeth with\r\nrain blown on the wind like spray, and hail at whiles. And when the\r\nrain was done, the wind veered to the north-west and blew the ridges\r\ndry. And then the little bits of rotten granite blew in our faces like\r\nhailstones on the wind. There was no shelter, not o’ the lee side of\r\nthe rocks, but everywhere the storm-wind baffled and buffeted us, and\r\nclapped his wings among the crags like thunder. Dear Heaven, weary we\r\nwere and like to drop, cold to the marrow, nigh blinded man and horse,\r\nyet with a dreadful industry pressed on. And my Lord Brandoch Daha was\r\nnow in the van now in the rear-guard, cheering men’s hearts who marked\r\nwith what blithe countenance himself did suffer the same hardships\r\nas his meanest trooper: like to one riding at ease to some great\r\nwedding-feast; crying, ‘What, lads, merrily on! These fen-toads of the\r\nDruima shall learn too late what way our mountain ponies do go like\r\nstags upon the mountain.’\r\n\r\n“When it began to be morning we came to our last halt, and there was\r\nour seven hundred horse hid in the corrie under the tall cliffs of\r\nErngate End. I warrant you we went carefully about it, so as no prying\r\nswine of Witchland looking up from below should aspy a glimpse of man\r\nor horse o’ the sky-line. His highness first set his sentinels and let\r\ncall the muster, and saw that every man had his morning meal and every\r\nhorse his feed. Then he took his stand behind a crag of rock whence he\r\ncould overlook the land below. He had me by him to do his errands. In\r\nthe first light we looked down westward over the mountain’s edge and\r\nsaw Krothering and the arms of the sea, not so dark but we might behold\r\ntheir fleet at anchor in Aurwath roads, and their camp like a batch of\r\nbeehives so as a man might think to cast a stone into’t below us. That\r\nwas the first time I’d e’er gone to the wars with him. Faith, he’s a\r\npretty man to see: leaned forward there on the heather with’s chin on\r\nhis folded arms, his helm laid aside so they should not see it glint\r\nfrom below; quiet like a cat: half asleep you’d say; but his eyes were\r\nawake, looking down on Krothering. ’Twas well seen even from so far\r\naway how vilely they had used it.\r\n\r\n“The great red sun leaped out o’ the eastern cloudbanks. A stir began\r\nin their camp below: standards set up, men gathering thereto, ranks\r\nforming, bugles sounding; then a score of horse galloping up the\r\nroad from Gashterndale into the camp. His highness, without turning\r\nhis head, beckoned with’s hand to me to call his captains. I ran and\r\nfetched ’em. He gave ’em swift commands, pointing down where the\r\nWitchland swine rolled out their battle; thieves and pirates who robbed\r\nhis highness’ subjects within his streams; with standard and pennons\r\nand glistering naked spears, moving northward from the tents. Then\r\nin the quiet came a sound made a man’s heart leap within him: faint\r\nout of the far hollows of Gashterndale, the trumpet of my Lord Juss’s\r\nbattle-call.\r\n\r\n“My Lord Brandoch Daha paused a minute, looking down. Then a turned him\r\nabout with face that shone like the morning. ‘Fair lords,’ a saith,\r\n‘now lightly on horseback, for Juss fighteth against his enemies.’ I\r\nthink he was well content. I think he was sure he would that day get\r\nhis heart’s syth of every one that had wronged him.\r\n\r\n“That was a long ride down from Erngate End. With all our hearts’ blood\r\ndrumming us to haste, we must yet go warily, picking our way i’ that\r\ntricky ground, steep as a roof-slope, uneven and with no sure foothold,\r\nwith sikes in wet moss and rocks outcropping and shifting screes. There\r\nwas nought but leave it to the horses, and bravely they brought us down\r\nthe steeps. We were not half way down ere we heard and saw how battle\r\nwas joined. So intent were the Witchlanders on my Lord’s main army, I\r\nthink we were off the steep ground and forming for the charge ere they\r\nwere ware of us. Our trumpeters sounded his battle challenge, _Who\r\nmeddles wi’ Brandoch Daha?_ and we came down on to Krothering Side\r\nlike a rock-fall.\r\n\r\n“I scarce know what way the battle went, father. ’Twas like a meeting\r\nof streams in spate. I think they opened to us right and left to ease\r\nthe shock. They that were before us went down like standing corn under\r\na hailstorm. We wheeled both ways, some ’gainst their right that was\r\nthrown back toward the camp, the more part with my Lord Brandoch Daha\r\nto our own right. I was with these in the main battle. His highness\r\nrode a hot stirring horse very fierce and dogged; knee to knee with him\r\nwent Styrkmir of Blackwood o’ the one side and Tharmrod o’ the other.\r\nNeither man nor horse might stand up before ’em, and they faring as in\r\na maze now this way now that, amid the thrumbling and thrasting o’ the\r\nfootmen, heads and arms smitten off, men hewn in sunder from crown to\r\nbelly, ay, to the saddle, riderless horses maddened, blood splashed up\r\nfrom the ground like the slush from a marsh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOLDIERS OF DEMONLAND.]\r\n\r\n“So for a time, till we had spent the vantage of our onset and felt\r\nfor the first time the weight of their strength. For Corinius, as it\r\nappeareth, was now himself ridden from the vanward where he had beat\r\nback for a time our main army, and set on against my Lord Brandoch Daha\r\nwith horsemen and spearmen; and commanded his sling-casters besides to\r\nlet freely at us and drive us toward the camp.\r\n\r\n“And now in the great swing of the battle were we carried back to the\r\ncamp again; and there was a sweet devils’ holiday: horses and men\r\ntripping over tent-ropes, tents torn down, crashes of broken crockery,\r\nand King Laxus come thither with sailors from the fleet, hamstringing\r\nour horses while Corinius charged us from the north and east. That\r\nCorinius beareth him in battle more like a devil from Hell than a\r\nmortal man. I’ the first two strokes of’s sword he overthrew two of our\r\nbest captains, Romenard of Dalney and Emeron Galt. Styrkmir, that stood\r\nin’s way to stop him, a flung down with’s spear, horse and man. They\r\nsay he met twice with my Lord Brandoch Daha that day, but each time\r\nwere they parted in the press ere they might rightly square together.\r\n\r\n“I have stood in some goodly battles, father, as well thou knowest:\r\nfirst following my Lord and my Lord Goldry Bluszco in foreign parts,\r\nand last year in the great rout at Crossby Outsikes, and again with\r\nmy Lord Spitfire when he smote the Witches on Brima Rapes, and in the\r\nmurthering great battle under Thremnir’s Heugh. But never was I in\r\nfight like to this of yesterday.\r\n\r\n“Never saw I such feats of arms. As witness Kamerar of Stropardon,\r\nwho with a great two-handed sword hewed off his enemy’s leg close to\r\nthe hip, so huge a blow the blade sheared through leg and saddle and\r\nhorse and all. And Styrkmir of Blackwood, rising like a devil out of\r\na heap of slain men, and though’s helm was lossen and a was bleeding\r\nfrom three or four great wounds a held off a dozen o’ the Witches\r\nwith’s deadly thrusts and sword-strokes, till they had enough and\r\ngave back before him: twelve before one, and he given over for dead\r\na while before. But all great deeds seemed trash beside the deeds of\r\nmy Lord Brandoch Daha. In one short while had he three times a horse\r\nslain stark dead under him, yet gat never a wound himself, which was\r\na marvel. For without care he rode through and about, smiting down\r\ntheir champions. I mind me of him once, with’s horse ripped and killed\r\nunder him, and one of those Witchland lords that tilted at him on the\r\nground as he leaped to’s feet again; how a caught the spear with’s two\r\nhands and by main strength yerked his enemy out o’ the saddle. Prince\r\nCargo it was, youngest of Corund’s sons. Long may the Witchland ladies\r\nstrain their dear eyes, they’ll ne’er see yon hendy lad come sailing\r\nhome again. His highness swapt him such a swipe o’ the neck-bone as he\r\npitched to earth, the head of him flew i’ the air like a tennis ball.\r\nAnd i’ the twinkling of an eye was my Lord Brandoch Daha horsed again\r\non’s enemy’s horse, and turned to charge ’em anew. You’d say his arm\r\nmust fail at last for weariness, of a man so lithe and jimp to look\r\non. Yet I think his last stroke i’ that battle was not lighter than\r\nthe first. And stones and spears and sword-strokes seemed to come upon\r\nhim with no more impression than blows with a straw would give to an\r\nadamant.\r\n\r\n“I know not how long was that fight among the tents. Only ’twas the\r\nbest fight I ever was at, and the bloodiest. And by all tellings ’twas\r\nas great work o’ the other part, where my Lord and his folk fought\r\ntheir way up on to the Side. But of that we knew nothing. Yet certain\r\nit is we had all been dead men had my Lord not there prevailed, as\r\ncertain ’tis he had never so prevailed but for our charging of their\r\nflank when they first advanced against him. But in that last hour all\r\nwe that fought among the tents thought each man only of this, how he\r\nmight slay yet one more Witch, and yet again one more, afore he should\r\ndie. For Corinius in that hour put forth his might to crush us; and\r\nfor every enemy there felled to earth two more seemed to be raised up\r\nagainst us. And our own folk fell fast, and the tents that were so\r\nwhite were one gore of blood.\r\n\r\n“When I was a little tiny boy, father, we had a sport, swimming in\r\nthe deep pools of Tivarandarwater, that one boy would catch ’tother\r\nand hold him under till he could no more for want of breath. Methinks\r\nthere’s no longing i’ the world so sore as the longing for air when he\r\nthat is stronger than thou grippeth thee still under the water, nor no\r\ngladness i’ the world like the bonny sweet air i’ thy lungs again when\r\na letteth thee shoot up to the free daylight. ’Twas right so with us,\r\nwho had now said adieu to hope and saw all lost save life itself, and\r\nthat not like to tarry long; when we heard suddenly the thunder of my\r\nLord’s trumpet sounding to the charge. And ere our startled wits might\r\nrightly think what that portended, was the whole surging battle whipped\r\nand scattered like the water of a lake caught up in a white squall;\r\nand that massed strength of the enemy which had invested us round with\r\nso great a stream of shot and steel reeled first forward then backward\r\nthen forward again upon us, confounded in a vast confusion. I trow new\r\nstrength came to our arms; I trow our swords opened their mouths. For\r\nnorthward we beheld the ensign of Galing streaming like a blazing star;\r\nand my Lord’s self in a moment, high advanced above the rout, and Zigg,\r\nand Astar, and hundreds of our horse, hewing their way toward us whiles\r\nwe hewed towards them. And now was reaping time for us, and time of\r\npayment for all those weary bloody hours we had held on to life with\r\nour teeth among the tents on Krothering Side, while they o’ the other\r\npart, my Lord and his, had with all the odds of the ground against them\r\npainfully and yard by yard fought out the fight to victory. And now,\r\nere we well wist of it, the day was won, and the victory ours, and the\r\nenemy broken and put to so great a rout as hath not been seen by living\r\nman.\r\n\r\n“That false king Corinius, after he had tarried to see the end of the\r\nbattle, fled with a few of his men out of the great slaughter, and as\r\nit later appeared gat him ashipboard in Aurwath harbour and with three\r\nships or four escaped to sea. But the most of their fleet was burned\r\nthere in the harbour to save it from our hands.\r\n\r\n“My Lord gave command to take up the wounded and tend ’em, friend and\r\nfoe alike. Among them was King Laxus ta’en up, stunned with a mace-blow\r\nor some such. So they brought him before the lords where they rested a\r\nlittle way down the Side above the home meads of Krothering.\r\n\r\n“He looked ’em all in the eye, most proud and soldier-like. Then\r\na saith unto my Lord, ‘It may be pain, but no shame to us to be\r\nvanquished after so equal and so great a fight. Herein only do I blame\r\nmy ill luck, that it denied me fall in battle. Thou mayst now, O Juss,\r\nstrike off my head for the treason I wrought you three years ago. And\r\nsince I know thee of a courteous and noble nature, I’ll not scorn to\r\nask of thee this courtesy, not to tarry but take it now.’\r\n\r\n“My Lord stood there like a war-horse after a breather. He took him by\r\nthe hand. ‘O Laxus,’ saith he, ‘I give thee not thy head only, but thy\r\nsword;’ and here a gave it him hilt-foremost. ‘For thy dealings with us\r\nin the battle of Kartadza, let time that hath an art to make dust of\r\nall things so do with the memory of these. Since then, thou hast shown\r\nthyself still our noble enemy; and so shall we account thee still.’\r\n\r\n“Therewith my Lord commanded bring King Laxus down to the sea, and ship\r\nhim aboard of a boat, for Corinius still held off the land with his\r\nships, waiting no doubt to see if he or any other of his folk could yet\r\nbe saved.\r\n\r\n“But as King Laxus was upon parting, my Lord Brandoch Daha, speaking\r\nwith great show of carelessness as of some trifling matter a had by\r\nchance called to mind, ‘My lord,’ saith he, ‘I ne’er ask favour of any\r\nman. Only in a manner of return of courtesies, methought thou mightest\r\nbe willing to bear my salutations to Corinius, sith I’ve no other\r\nmessenger.’\r\n\r\n“Laxus answereth he would freely do it. Then saith his highness, ‘Say\r\nto him I will not blame him that he abode us not i’ the field after\r\nthe battle was lost, for that had been a simple part, flatly ’gainst\r\nall maxims of right soldiership, and but to cast his life away. But\r\nfreakish Fortune I blame, that twined us one from the other when we\r\nshould have dealt together this day. He hath borne him in my halls, I\r\nam let to know, more i’ the fashion of a swine or a beastly ape than a\r\nman. Pray him come ashore ere you sail home, that I and he, with no man\r\nelse to make betwixt us, may cast up our account. We swear him peace\r\nand grith and a safe conduct back to’s ships if he prevail against me\r\nor if I so use him that he cry for mercy. If he’ll not take this offer,\r\nthen is he a dastard; and the whole world shall so acclaim him.’\r\n\r\n“‘Sir,’ saith Laxus, ‘I’ll punctually discharge thy message.’\r\n\r\n“Whether he did so or no, father, I know not. But if he did, it seemeth\r\nit was little to Corinius’s liking. For no sooner had his ship ta’en\r\nLaxus aboard, than she hoised sail and put out into the deep, and so\r\ngood-bye.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe young man ceased, and they were all three silent awhile. A faint\r\nbreeze rippled the foliage of the oakwoods of Tivarandardale. The sun\r\nwas down behind the stately Thornbacks, and the whole sky from bourne\r\nto bourne was alight with the sunset glory. Dappled clouds, with sky\r\nshowing here and there between, covered the heavens, save in the west\r\nwhere a great archway of clear air opened between clouds and earth: air\r\nof an azure that seemed to burn, so pure it was, so deep, so charged\r\nwith warmth: not the harsh blue of noon-day nor the sumptuous deep\r\neastern blue of approaching night, but a bright heavenly blue bordering\r\non green, deep, tender, and delicate as the spirit of evening. Athwart\r\nthe midst of that window of the west a blade of cloud, hard-edged\r\nand jagged with teeth coloured as of live coals and dead, fiery and\r\niron-dark in turn, stretched like a battered sword. The clouds above\r\nthe arch were pale rose: the zenith like black opal, dark blue and\r\nthunderous grey dappled with fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                XXVII: THE SECOND EXPEDITION TO IMPLAND\r\n\r\n  HOW THE LORD JUSS, NOT TO BE PERSUADED FROM HIS SET PURPOSE, FOUND,\r\n      WHERE LEAST IT WAS TO BE LOOKED FOR, UPHOLDING IN THAT RESOLVE;\r\n      AND OF THE SAILING OF THE ARMAMENT TO MUELVA BY WAY OF THE\r\n      STRAITS OF MELIKAPHKHAZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was the last ember of red summer burning when they cut them that\r\nharvest on Krothering Side. Autumn came, and winter months, and the\r\nlengthening days of the returning year. And with the first breath of\r\nspring were the harbours filled with ships of war, so many as had never\r\nin former days been seen in the land, and in every countryside from the\r\nwestern Isles to Byland, from Shalgreth and Kelialand to the headlands\r\nunder Rimon Armon, were soldiers gathered with their horses and all\r\ninstruments of war.\r\n\r\nLord Brandoch Daha rode from the west, the day the Pasque flowers\r\nfirst opened on the bluffs below Erngate End and primroses made sweet\r\nthe birch-forests in Gashterndale. He set forth betimes, and hard\r\nhe rode, and he rode into Galing by the Lion Gate about the hour of\r\nnoon. There was Lord Juss in his private chamber, and greeted him with\r\ngreat joy and love. So Brandoch Daha asked, “What speed?” And Juss\r\nanswered, “Thirty ships and five afloat in Lookinghaven, whereof all\r\nsave four be dragons of war. Zigg I expect to-morrow with the Kelialand\r\nlevies; Spitfire lieth at Owlswick with fifteen hundred men from the\r\nsouthlands; Volle came in but three hours since with four hundred more.\r\nIn sum, I’ll have four thousand, reckoning ships’ companies and our own\r\nbodyguards.”\r\n\r\n“Eight ships of war have I,” said Lord Brandoch Daha, “in Stropardon\r\nFirth, all busked and boun. Five more at Aurwath, five at Lornagay in\r\nMorvey, and three on the Mealand coast at Stackray Oyce, besides four\r\nmore in the Isles. And I have sixteen hundred spearmen and six hundred\r\nhorse. All these shall come together to join with thine in Lookinghaven\r\nat the snapping of my fingers, give me but seven days’ notice.”\r\n\r\nJuss gripped him by the hand. “Bare were my back without thee,” he said.\r\n\r\n“In Krothering I’ve shifted not a stone nor swept not a chamber clean,”\r\nsaid Brandoch Daha. “’Tis a muck-pit. Every man’s hand I might command\r\nI set only to this. And now ’tis ready.” He turned sharp toward Juss\r\nand looked at him a minute in silence. Then with a gravity that sat\r\nnot often on his lips he said, “Let me be urgent with thee once more:\r\nstrike and delay not. Do him not again that kindness we did him\r\naforetime, fribbling our strength away on the cursed shores of Impland,\r\nand by the charmed waters of Ravary, so as he might as secure as sleep\r\nsend Corsus hither and Corinius to work havoc i’ the land; and so put\r\non us the greatest shame was ever laid on mortal men, and we not bred\r\nup to suffer shame.”\r\n\r\n“Thou saidst seven days,” said Juss. “Snap thy fingers and call up thy\r\narmies. I’ll delay thee not an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, but I mean to Carcë,” said he.\r\n\r\n“To Carcë, whither else?” said Juss. “But I’ll take my brother Goldry\r\nwith us.”\r\n\r\n“But I mean first to Carcë,” said Brandoch Daha. “Let my opinion sway\r\nthee once. Why, a schoolboy should tell thee, clear thy flank and rear\r\nere thou go forward.”\r\n\r\nJuss smiled. “I love this new garb of caution, cousin,” said he; “it\r\ndoth most prettily become thee. I question though whether this be not\r\nthe true cause: that Corinius took not up thy challenge last summer,\r\nbut let it lie, and that hath left thee hungry still.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha looked him sidelong in the eye, and laughed. “O Juss,”\r\nhe said, “thou hast touched me near. But ’tis not that. That was in\r\nthe weird that bright lady laid on me, in the sparrow-hawk castle\r\nin Impland forlorn: that he I held most in hate should ruin my fair\r\nlordship, and that to my hand should vengeance be denied. That I e’en\r\nmust brook. O no. Think only, delays are dangerous. Come, be advised.\r\nBe not mulish.”\r\n\r\nBut the Lord Juss’s face was grave. “Urge me no more, dear friend,”\r\nsaid he. “Thou sleep’st soft. But to me, when I am cast in my first\r\nsleep, cometh many a time the likeness of Goldry Bluszco, held by a\r\nmaleficial charm on the mountain top of Zora Rach, that standeth apart,\r\nout of the sunlight, out of all sound or warmth of life. Long ago I\r\nmade vow to turn neither to the right nor to the left, until I set him\r\nfree.”\r\n\r\n“He is thy brother,” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “Also is he mine own\r\nfamiliar friend, whom I love scarce less than thee. But when thou\r\nspeakest of oaths, remember there’s La Fireez too. What shall he think\r\non us after our oaths to him three years ago, that night in Carcë? Yet\r\nthis one blow should right him too.”\r\n\r\n“He will understand,” said Juss.\r\n\r\n“He is to come with Gaslark, and thou told’st me thou dost e’en now\r\nexpect them,” said Brandoch Daha. “I’ll leave you. I cannot for shame\r\nsay to him, ‘Patience, friend, truly ’tis not to-day convenient.\r\nThou shalt be paid in time.’ By heavens, I’d scorn to entreat my\r\nmantle-maker so. And this our friend that lost all and languisheth in\r\nexile because he saved our lives.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he stood up in great discontent and ire as if to leave\r\nthe chamber. But Juss caught him by the wrist. “Thou dost upbraid me\r\nmost unjustly, and well thou knowest it in thy heart, and ’tis that\r\nmakes thee so angry. Hark, the horn soundeth at the gate, and ’tis for\r\nGaslark. I’ll not let thee go.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Lord Brandoch Daha, “have thy will. Only ask not me to\r\nplead thy rotten case to them. If I speak it shall be to shame thee.\r\nNow thou’rt warned.”\r\n\r\nNow went they into the high presence chamber, where was bright ladies\r\nnot a few, and captains and noble persons from up and down the land,\r\nand stood on the dais. Gaslark the king walked up the shining floor,\r\nand behind him his captains and councillors of Goblinland walked two by\r\ntwo. The Prince La Fireez strode at his elbow, proud as a lion.\r\n\r\nBlithely they greeted those lords of Demonland that rose up to greet\r\nthem beneath the starry canopy, and the Lady Mevrian that stood betwixt\r\nher brother and Lord Juss so as ’twere hard to say which of the three\r\nwas fairest to look on, so much they differed in their beauty’s glory.\r\nGro, standing near, said in himself, “I know a fourth. And were she\r\nbut joined with these, then were the crown of the whole earth’s\r\nloveliness fitted in this one chamber: in a right casket surely. And\r\nthe Gods in heaven (if there be Gods indeed) should go pale for envy,\r\nhaving in their starry gallery no fair to match with these; not Phoebus\r\nApollo, not the chaste Huntress, nor the foam-born Queen herself.”\r\n\r\nBut Gaslark, when his eye lighted on the long black beard, the lean\r\nfigure slightly stooping, the pallid brow, the curls smoothed with\r\nperfumed unguents, the sickle-like nose, the great liquid eyes, the\r\nlily hand; he, beholding and knowing these of old, waxed in a moment\r\ndark as thunder with the blood-rush beneath his sun-browned skin, and\r\nwith a great sweep snatched out his sword, as if without gare or beware\r\nto thrust him through. Gro stepped hastily back. But the Lord Juss came\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n“Let alone, Juss,” cried Gaslark. “Know’st not this fellow, what a vile\r\nenemy and viper we have here? A pretty perfumed villain! who for so\r\nmany years did spin me a thread of many seditions and troubles, while\r\nhis smooth tongue gat money from me still. Blessed occasion! Now will I\r\nlet his soul out.”\r\n\r\nBut the Lord Juss laid his hand on Gaslark’s sword-arm. “Gaslark,” said\r\nhe, “leave off thy rages, and put up thy sword. A year ago thou’dst\r\ndone me no wrong. But to-day thou’dst have slain me a man of mine own\r\nmen, and a lord of Demonland.”\r\n\r\nNow when they had done their greetings, they washed their hands and\r\nsate at dinner and were nobly served and feasted. And the Lord Juss\r\nmade peace betwixt Gro and Gaslark, albeit ’twas no light task to\r\nprevail upon Gaslark to forgive him. Thereafter they retired them with\r\nGaslark and La Fireez into a chamber apart.\r\n\r\nGaslark the king spake and said, “None can gainsay it, O Juss, that\r\nthis fight ye won last harvest tide was the greatest seen on land these\r\nmany years, and of greatest consequence. But I have heard a bird sing\r\nthere shall be yet greater deeds done ere many moons be past. Therefore\r\nit is we came hither to thee, I and La Fireez that be your friends\r\nfrom of old, to pray thee let us go with thee on thy quest across the\r\nworld after thy brother, for sorrow of whose loss the whole world\r\nlanguisheth; and thereafter let us go with you on your going up to\r\nCarcë.”\r\n\r\n“O Juss,” said the Prince, “we would not in after-days that men should\r\nsay, On such a time fared the Demons into perilous lands enchanted and\r\nby their strength and valorousness set free the Lord Goldry Bluszco\r\n(or haply, there ended their life’s days in that glorious quest); but\r\nGaslark and La Fireez were not in it, they bade their friends farewell,\r\nhung up their swords, and lived a quiet and merry life in Zajë Zaculo.\r\nSo let their memory be forgot.”\r\n\r\nLord Juss sat silent a minute, as one much moved. “O Gaslark,” he said\r\nat length, “I’ll take thine offer without another word. But unto thee,\r\ndear Prince, I must bare mine heart somewhat. For thou here art come\r\nnot strest in our quarrel to spend thy blood, only to put us yet deeper\r\nin thy debt. And yet small blame it were to thee shouldst thou in\r\ndishonourable sort revile me, as many shall cry out against me, for a\r\nfalse friend unto thee and a friend forsworn.”\r\n\r\nBut the Prince La Fireez brake in upon him, saying, “I prithee have\r\ndone, or thou’lt shame me quite. Whate’er I did in Carcë, ’twas but\r\nequal payment for your saving of my life in Lida Nanguna. So was all\r\nevened up betwixt us. Think then no more on’t, but deny me not to go\r\nwith you to Impland. But up to Carcë I’ll not go with you: for albeit\r\nI am clean broke with Witchland, against Corund and his kin I will not\r\ndraw sword nor against my lady sister. A black curse on the day I gave\r\nher white hand to Corund! She holdeth too much of our stock, methinks:\r\nher heraldry is hearts not hands. And giving her hand she gave her\r\nheart. ’Tis a strange world.”\r\n\r\n“La Fireez,” said Juss, “we weigh not so lightly our obligation unto\r\nthee. Yet must I hold my course; having sworn a strong oath that I\r\nwould turn aside neither to the right nor to the left until I had\r\ndelivered my dear brother Goldry out of bondage. So sware I or ever I\r\nwent that ill journey to Carcë and was closed in prison fast and by\r\nthee delivered. Nor shall blame of friends nor wrongful misprision nor\r\nany power that is shake me in this determination. But when that is\r\ndone, no rest remaineth unto us till we win back for thee thy rightful\r\nrealm of Pixyland, and many good things besides to be a token of our\r\nlove.”\r\n\r\nSaid the Prince, “Thou doest right. If thou didst other thou’dst have\r\nmy blame.”\r\n\r\n“And mine thereto,” said Gaslark. “Do not I grieve, think’st thou, to\r\nsee the Princess Armelline, my sweet young cousin, grow every day more\r\nwan o’ the cheek and pale? And all for sorrow and teen for her own\r\ntrue love, the Lord Goldry Bluszco. And she so carefully brought up by\r\nher mother as nothing was too dear or hard to be brought to pass for\r\nher desire, thinking that a creature so noble and perfect could not be\r\ntrained up too delicately. I deem to-day better than to-morrow, and\r\nto-morrow better than his morrow, to set sail for wide-fronted Impland.”\r\n\r\nAll this while the Lord Brandoch Daha said never a word. He sat back\r\nin his chair of ivory and chrysoprase, now toying with his golden\r\nfinger-rings, now twisting and untwisting the yellow curls of his\r\nmoustachios and beard. In a while he yawned, rose from his seat and\r\nfell to pacing lazily up and down. He had hitched up his sword across\r\nhis back under his two elbows, so that the shoe of the scabbard stood\r\nout under one arm and the jewelled hilt under the other. His fingers\r\nstrummed little tunes on the front of the rich rose velvet doublet that\r\ncased his chest. The spring sunlight as he paced from shine to shade\r\nand to shine again, passing the tall windows, seemed to caress his face\r\nand form. It was as if spring laughed for joy beholding in him one that\r\nwas her own child, clothed to outward view with so much loveliness and\r\ngrace, but full besides to the eyes and finger-tips with fire and vital\r\nsap, like her own buds bursting in the Brankdale coppices.\r\n\r\nIn a while he ceased his walking, and stood by the Lord Gro who sat a\r\nlittle apart from the rest. “How thinkest thou, Gro, of our counsels?\r\nArt thou for the straight road or the crooked? For Carcë or Zora Rach?”\r\n\r\n“Of two roads,” answered Gro, “a wise man will choose ever that one\r\nwhich is indirect. For but consider the matter, thou that art a great\r\ncragsman: think our life’s course a lofty cliff. I am to climb it,\r\nsometime up, sometime down. I pray, whither leadeth the straight road\r\non such a cliff? Why, nowhither. For if I will go up by the straight\r\nway, ’tis not possible; I am left gaping whiles thou by crooked courses\r\nhast gained the top. Or if down, why ’tis easy and swift; but then,\r\nno more climbing ever more for me. And thou, clambering down by the\r\ncrooked way, shalt find me a dead and unsightly corpse at the bottom.”\r\n\r\n“Grammercy for thy me’s and thee’s,” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “Well,\r\n’tis a most weighty principle, backed with a most just and lively\r\nexposition. How dost thou interpret thy maxim in our present question?”\r\n\r\nLord Gro looked up at him. “My lord, you have used me well, and to\r\ndeserve your love and advance your fortunes I have pondered much how\r\nyou of Demonland might best obtain revenge upon your enemies. And I\r\ndaily thinking hereupon, and conceiving in my head divers imaginations,\r\ncan devise no means but one that in my fancy seemeth best, which is\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\n“Let me hear it,” said Lord Brandoch Daha.\r\n\r\nSaid Gro, “’Twas ever a fault in you Demons that you would not perceive\r\nhow ’tis oft-times good to draw the snake from her hole by another\r\nman’s hand. Consider now your matter. You have a great force both for\r\nland and sea. Trust not too much in that. Oft hath he of the little\r\nforce o’ercome most powerful enemies, going about to entrap them\r\nby sleight and policy. But consider yet again. You have a thing is\r\nmightier far than all your horses and spearmen and dragons of war,\r\nmightier than thine own sword, my lord, and thou accounted the best\r\nswordsman in all the world.”\r\n\r\n“What thing is that?” asked he.\r\n\r\nGro answered, “Reputation, my Lord Brandoch Daha. This reputation of\r\nyou Demons for open dealings even to your worst enemies.”\r\n\r\n“Tush,” said he. “’Tis but our way i’ the world. Moreover, ’tis, I\r\nthink, a thing natural in great persons, of whatsoever country they\r\nbe born. Treachery and double dealing proceed commonly from fear,\r\nand that is a thing which I think no man in this land comprehendeth.\r\nMyself, I do think that when the high Gods made a person of my quality\r\nthey traced between his two eyes something, I know not what, which the\r\ncommon sort durst not look upon without trembling.”\r\n\r\n“Give me but leave,” said Lord Gro, “and I’ll pluck you a braver\r\ntriumph in a little hour than your swords should win you in two years.\r\nSpeak smooth words to Witchland, offer him composition, bring him to a\r\ncouncil and all his great men along with him. I’ll so devise it, they\r\nshall all be suddenly taken off in a night, haply by setting upon them\r\nin their beds, or as we may find most convenient. All save Corund and\r\nhis sons; them we may wisely spare, and conclude peace with them. It\r\nshall not by ten days delay your sailing to Impland, whither you might\r\nthen proceed with light hearts and minds at ease.”\r\n\r\n“Very prettily conceived, upon my soul,” said Brandoch Daha. “Might I\r\nadvise thee, thou’dst best not talk to Juss i’ this manner. Not now, I\r\nmean, while his mind’s so bent on matters of weight and moment. Nor I\r\nshould not say it to my sister Mevrian. Women will oft-times take in\r\nsad earnest such a conceit, though it be but talk and discourse. With\r\nme ’tis otherwise. I am something of a philosopher myself, and thy jest\r\nambleth with my humour very pleasantly.”\r\n\r\n“Thou art pleased to be merry,” said Lord Gro. “Many ere now, as the\r\nevent hath proved, rejected my wholesome counsels to their own great\r\nhurt.”\r\n\r\nBut Brandoch Daha said lightly, “Fear not, my Lord Gro, we’ll reject\r\nno honest redes of so wise a counsellor as thou. But,” and here was a\r\nlight in the eye of him made Gro startle, “did any man with serious\r\nintent dare bid me do a dastard deed, he should have my sword through\r\nthe dearest part of’s body.”\r\n\r\nLord Brandoch Daha now turned him to the rest of them. “Juss,” said\r\nhe, “friend of my heart, meseemeth y’are all of one mind, and none of\r\nmy mind. I’ll e’en bid you farewell. Farewell, Gaslark; farewell, La\r\nFireez.”\r\n\r\n“But whither away?” said Juss, standing up from his chair. “Thou must\r\nnot leave us.”\r\n\r\n“Whither but to mine own place?” said he, and was gone from the chamber.\r\n\r\nGaslark said, “He’s much incensed. What hast thou done to anger him?”\r\n\r\nMevrian said to Juss, “I’ll follow and cool him.” She went, but soon\r\nreturned saying, “No avail, my lords. He is ridden forth from Galing\r\nand away as fast as his horse might carry him.”\r\n\r\nNow were they all in a great stew, some conjecturing one thing and\r\nsome another. Only the Lord Juss kept silence and a calm countenance,\r\nand the Lady Mevrian. And Juss said at length to Gaslark, “This it is,\r\nthat he chafeth at every day’s delay that letteth him from having at\r\nCorinius. Certes, I’ll not blame him, knowing the vile injuries the\r\nfellow did him and his insolence toward thee, madam. Be not troubled.\r\nHis own self shall bring him back to me when time is, as no other power\r\nshould do ’gainst his good will; he whose great heart Heaven cannot\r\nforce with force.”\r\n\r\nAnd even so, the next night after, when folk were abed and asleep,\r\nJuss, in his high bed-chamber sitting late at his book, heard a bridle\r\nring. So he called his boys to go with him with torches to the gate.\r\nAnd there in the dancing torch-light came the Lord Brandoch Daha\r\na-riding into Galing Castle, and somewhat of the bigness of a great\r\npumpkin tied in a silken cloth hung at his saddle-bow. Juss met him in\r\nthe gate alone. “Let me down from my horse,” he said, “and receive from\r\nme thy bed-fellow that thou must sleep with by the Lake of Ravary.”\r\n\r\n“Thou hast gotten it?” said Juss. “The hippogriff’s egg, out of Dule\r\nTarn, by thyself alone?” and he took the bundle right tenderly in his\r\ntwo hands.\r\n\r\n“Ay,” answered he. “’Twas where thou and I made sure of it last summer,\r\naccording to the word of her little martlet that first found it for us.\r\nThe tarn was frozen and ’twas tricky work diving and most villanous\r\ncold. It is small marvel thou’rt a lucky man in thine undertakings, O\r\nJuss, when thou hast such an art to draw thy friends to second thee.”\r\n\r\n“I thought thou’dst not leave me,” said Juss.\r\n\r\n“Thought?” cried Brandoch Daha. “Didst ever dream I’d suffer thee to\r\ndo thy foolishnesses alone? Nay, I’ll come first to the enchanted lake\r\nwith thee, and let be Carcë i’ the meantime. Howbeit I’ll do it ’gainst\r\nthe stream of my resolution quite.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow was but six days more of preparation, and on the second day of\r\nApril was all ready in Lookinghaven for the sailing of that mighty\r\narmament: fifty and nine ships of war and five ships of burthen and\r\nthrice two thousand fighting men.\r\n\r\nLady Mevrian sat on her milk-white mare overlooking the harbour\r\nwhere the ships all orderly rode at anchor, shadowy gray against the\r\nsun-bright shimmer of the sea, with here and there a splash of colour,\r\ncrimson or blue or grass-green, from their painted hulls or a beam of\r\nthe sun glancing from their golden masts or figure-heads. Gro stood\r\nat her bridle-rein. The Galing road, winding down from Havershaw\r\nTongue, ran close below them and so along the sea-shore to the quays\r\nat Lookinghaven. Along that road the hard earth rang with the tramp\r\nof armed men and the tramp of horses, and the light west wind wafted\r\nto Gro and Mevrian on their grassy hill snatches of deep-voiced\r\nbattle-chants or the galloping notes of trumpet and pipe and the drum\r\nthat sets men’s hearts a-throb.\r\n\r\nIn the van rode the Lord Zigg, four trumpeters walking before him in\r\ngold and purple. His armour from chin to toe shone with silver, and\r\njewels blazed on his gorget and baldrick and the hilt of his long\r\nstraight sword. He rode a black stallion savage-eyed with ears laid\r\nback and a tail that swept the earth. A great company of horse followed\r\nhim, and half as many tall spearmen, in russet leather jerkins plated\r\nwith brass and silver. “These,” said Mevrian, “be of Kelialand and the\r\nshore-steads of Arrowfirth, and his own vassalage from Rammerick and\r\nAmadardale. That is Hesper Golthring rideth a little behind him on\r\nhis right hand; he loveth two things in this world, a good horse and\r\na swift ship. He on the left, he o’ the helm of dull silver set with\r\nraven’s wings, so long of the leg thou’dst say if he rode a little\r\nhorse he might straddle and walk it: Styrkmir of Blackwood. He is of\r\nour kin; not yet twenty years old, yet since Krothering Side accounted\r\none of our ablest.”\r\n\r\nSo she showed him all as they rode by. Peridor of Sule, captain of the\r\nMealanders, and his nephew Stypmar. Fendor of Shalgreth with Emeron\r\nGalt his young brother, that was newly healed from the great wound\r\nCorinius gave him at Krothering Side; these leading the shepherds and\r\nherdsmen from the great heaths north of Switchwater, who will hold by\r\nthe stirrup and so with their light bucklers and little brown swords go\r\ninto battle with the horsemen full gallop against the enemy. Bremery in\r\nhis ram’s-horn helm of gold and broidered surcoat of scarlet velvet,\r\nleading the dalesmen from Onwardlithe and Tivarandardale. Trentmar of\r\nScorradale with the north-eastern levies from Byland and the Strands\r\nand Breakingdale. Astar of Rettray, lean and lithe, bony-faced,\r\ngallant-eyed, white of skin, with bright red hair and beard, riding\r\nhis lovely roan at the head of two companies of spearmen with huge\r\niron-studded shields: men from about Drepaby and the south-eastern\r\ndales, landed men and home-men of Lord Goldry Bluszco. Then the\r\nisland dwellers from the west, with old Quazz of Dalney riding in the\r\nplace of honour, noble to look on with his snowy beard and shining\r\narmour, but younger men their true leaders in war: Melchar of Strufey,\r\ngreat-chested, fierce-eyed, with thick brown curling hair, horsed on a\r\nplunging chestnut, his byrny bright with gold, a rich mantle of creamy\r\nsilk brocade flung about his ample shoulders, and Tharmrod on his\r\nlittle black mare with silver byrny and bats-winged helm, he that held\r\nKenarvey in fee for Lord Brandoch Daha, keen and ready like an arrow\r\ndrawn to the barbs. And after them the Westmark men, with Arnund of By\r\ntheir captain. And after them, four hundred horse, not to be surpassed\r\nfor beauty or ordered array by any in that great army, and young\r\nKamerar riding at their head, burly as a giant, straight as a lance,\r\napparelled like a king, bearing on his mighty spear the pennon of the\r\nLord of Krothering.\r\n\r\n“Look well on these,” said Mevrian as they passed by. “Our own men\r\nof the Side and Thunderfirth and Stropardon. Thou may’st search the\r\nwide world and not find their like for speed and fire and all warlike\r\ngoodliness and readiness to the word of command. Thou look’st sad, my\r\nlord.”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” said Lord Gro, “to the ear of one that useth, as I use, to\r\nconsider the vanity of all high earthly pomps, the music of these\r\npowers and glories hath a deep under-drone of sadness. Kings and\r\ngovernors that do exult in strength and beauty and lustihood and rich\r\napparel, showing themselves for awhile upon the stage of the world and\r\nopen dominion of high heaven, what are they but the gilded summer fly\r\nthat decayeth with the dying day?”\r\n\r\n“My brother and the rest must not stay for us,” said the lady. “They\r\nmeant to go aboard as soon as the army should be come down to the\r\nharbour, for their ships be to sail out first down the firth. Is it\r\ndetermined indeed that thou goest with them on this journey?”\r\n\r\n“I had so determined, madam,” answered he. She was beginning to move\r\ndown towards the road and the harbour, but Gro put a hand on the rein\r\nand stopped her. “Dear lady,” he said, “these three nights together I\r\nhave dreamed a dream: a strange dream, and all the particulars thereof\r\nbetokening heavy anxiety, increase of peril, and savage mischief;\r\npromising some terrible issue. Methinks if I go on this journey thou\r\nshalt see my face no more.”\r\n\r\n“O fie, my lord,” cried she, reaching him her hand, “give never a\r\nthought to such fond imaginings. ’Twas the moon but glancing in thine\r\neye. Or if not, stay with us here and cheat Fate.”\r\n\r\nGro kissed her hand, and kept it in his. “My Lady Mevrian,” he said,\r\n“Fate will not be cheated, cog we never so wisely. I do think there be\r\nnot many extant that in a noble way fear the face of death less than\r\nmyself. I’ll go o’ this journey. There is but one thing should turn me\r\nback.”\r\n\r\n“And ’tis?” said she, for he fell silent on a sudden.\r\n\r\nHe paused, looking down at her gloved hand resting in his. “A man\r\nbecometh hoarse and dumb,” said he, “if a wolf hath the advantage first\r\nto eye him. Didst thou procure thee a wolf to dumb me when I would tell\r\nthee? But I did once; enough to let thee know. O Mevrian, dost thou\r\nremember Neverdale?”\r\n\r\nHe looked up at her. But Mevrian sat with head erect, like her\r\nPatroness divine, with sweet cool lips set firm and steady eyes fixed\r\non the haven and the riding ships. Gently she drew her hand from Gro’s,\r\nand he strove not to retain it. She eased forward the reins. Gro\r\nmounted and followed her. They rode quietly down to the road and so\r\nsouthward side by side to the harbour. Ere they came within earshot of\r\nthe quay, Mevrian spake and said, “Thou’lt not think me graceless nor\r\nforgetful, my lord. All that is mine, O ask it, and I’ll give it thee\r\nwith both hands. But ask me not that I have not to give, or if I gave\r\nshould give but false gold. For that’s a thing not good for thee nor\r\nme, nor I would not do it to an enemy, far less to thee my friend.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow was the army all gotten ashipboard, and farewells said to Volle and\r\nthose who should abide at home with him. The ships rowed out into the\r\nfirth all orderly, their silken sails unfurled, and that great armament\r\nsailed southward into the open seas under a clear sky. All the way\r\nthe wind favoured them, and they made a swift passage, so that on the\r\nthirtieth morning from their sailing out of Lookinghaven they sighted\r\nthe long gray cliff-line of Impland the More dim in the lowblown spray\r\nof the sea, and sailed through the Straits of Melikaphkhaz in column\r\nahead, for scarce might two ships pass abreast through that narrow way.\r\nBlack precipices shut in the straits on either hand, and the sea-birds\r\nin their thousands whitened every little ledge of those cliffs like\r\nsnow. Great flights of them rose and circled overhead as the ships\r\nsped by, and the air was full of their plaints. And right and left, as\r\nof young whales blowing, columns of white spray shot up continually\r\nfrom the surface of the sea. For these were the stately-winged gannets\r\nfishing that sea-strait. By threes and fours they flew, each following\r\nother in ordered line, many mast-heights high; and ever and anon\r\none checked in her flight as if a bolt had smitten her, and swooped\r\nhead-foremost with wings half-spread, like a broad-barbed dart of\r\ndazzling whiteness, till at a few feet above the surface she clapped\r\nclose her wings and cleft the water with a noise as of a great stone\r\ncast into the sea. Then in a moment up she bobbed, white and spruce\r\nwith her prey in her gullet; rode the waves a minute to rest and\r\nconsider; then with great sweeping wing-strokes up again to resume her\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nAfter a mile or two the narrows opened and the cliffs grew lower, and\r\nthe fleet sped past the red reefs of Uaimnaz and the lofty stacks of\r\nPashnemarthra white with sea-gulls on to the blue solitude of the\r\nDidornian Sea. All day they sailed south-east with a failing wind. The\r\ncoast-line of Melikaphkhaz fell away astern, paled in the mists of\r\ndistance, and was lost to sight, until only the square cloven outline\r\nof the Pashnemarthran islands broke the level horizon of the sea. Then\r\nthese too sank out of sight, and the ships rowed on south-eastward in a\r\ndead calm. The sun stooped to the western waves, entering his bath of\r\nblood-red fire. He sank, and all the ways were darkened. All night they\r\nrowed gently on under the strange southern stars, and the broken waters\r\nof that sea at every oar-stroke were like fire burning. Then out of the\r\nsea to eastward came the day-star, ushering the dawn, brighter than all\r\nnight’s stars, tracing a little path of gold along the waters. Then\r\ndawn, filling the low eastern skies with a fleet of tiny cockle-shells\r\nof bright gold fire; then the great face of the sun ablaze. And with\r\nthe going up of the sun a light wind sprang up, bellying their sails on\r\nthe starboard tack; so that ere day declined the sea-cliffs of Muelva\r\nhung white above the spray-mist on their larboard bow. They beached\r\nthe ships on a white shell-strand behind a headland that sheltered it\r\nfrom the east and north. Here the barrier of cliffs stood back a little\r\nfrom the shore, giving place for a fertile dell of green pasture, and\r\nwoods clustering at the foot of the cliffs, and a little spring of\r\nwater in the midst.\r\n\r\nSo for that night they slept on board, and next day made their camp,\r\ndischarging the ships of burthen that were laden with the horses and\r\nstuff. But the Lord Juss was minded not to tarry an hour more in Muelva\r\nthan should suffice to give all needful orders to Gaslark and La Fireez\r\nwhat they should do and when expect him again, and to make provision\r\nfor himself and those who must fare with him beyond those shadowing\r\ncliffs into the haunted wastes of the Moruna. Ere noon was all this\r\naccomplished and farewells said, and those lords, Juss, Spitfire, and\r\nBrandoch Daha, set forth along the beach southward towards a point\r\nwhere it seemed most hopeful to scale the cliffs. With them went the\r\nLord Gro, both by his own wish and because he had known the Moruna\r\naforetime and these particular parts thereof; and with them went\r\nbesides those two brothers-in-law, Zigg and Astar, bearing the precious\r\nburden of the egg, for that honour and trust had Juss laid on them at\r\ntheir earnest seeking. So with some pains after an hour or more they\r\nwon up the barrier, and halted for a minute on the cliff’s edge.\r\n\r\nThe skin of Gro’s hands was hurt with the sharp rocks. Tenderly he\r\ndrew on his lambswool gloves, and shivered a little; for the breath of\r\nthat desert blew snell and frore and there seemed a shadow in the air\r\nsouthward, for all it was bright and gentle weather below whence they\r\nwere come. Yet albeit his frail body quailed, even so were his spirits\r\nwithin him raised with high and noble imaginings as he stood on the\r\nlip of that rocky cliff. The cloudless vault of heaven; the unnumbered\r\nlaughter of the sea; that quiet cove beneath, and those ships of war\r\nand that army camping by the ships; the emptiness of the blasted wolds\r\nto southward, where every rock seemed like a dead man’s skull and every\r\nrank tuft of grass hag-ridden; the bearing of those lords of Demonland\r\nwho stood beside him, as if nought should be of commoner course to them\r\npursuing their resolve than to turn their backs on living land and\r\nenter those regions of the dead; these things with a power as of a\r\nmighty music made Gro’s breath catch in his throat and the tear spring\r\nin his eye.\r\n\r\nIn such wise after more than two years did Lord Juss begin his second\r\ncrossing of the Moruna in quest of his dear brother the Lord Goldry\r\nBluszco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    XXVIII: ZORA RACH NAM PSARRION\r\n\r\n  OF THE LORD JUSS’S RIDING OF THE HIPPOGRIFF TO ZORA RACH, AND OF\r\n      THE ILLS ENCOUNTERED BY HIM IN THAT ACCURSED PLACE, AND THE\r\n      MANNER OF HIS PERFORMING HIS GREAT ENTERPRISE TO DELIVER HIS\r\n      BROTHER OUT OF BONDAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLulled with light-stirring airs too gentle-soft to ruffle her glassy\r\nsurface, warm incense-laden airs sweet with the perfume of immortal\r\nflowers, the charmed Lake of Ravary dreamed under the moon. It was the\r\nlast hour before the dawn. Enchanted boats, that seemed builded of the\r\nglow-worm’s light, drifted on the starry bosom of the lake. Over the\r\nsloping woods the limbs of the mountains lowered, unmeasured, vast,\r\nmysterious in the moon’s glamour. In remote high spaces of night beyond\r\nglimmered the spires of Koshtra Pivrarcha and the virgin snows of\r\nRomshir and Koshtra Belorn. No bird or beast moved in the stillness:\r\nonly a nightingale singing to the stars from a coppice of olive-trees\r\nnear the Queen’s pavilion on the eastern shore. And that was a note not\r\nlike a bird’s of middle earth, but a note to charm down spirits out\r\nof the air, or to witch the imperishable senses of the Gods when they\r\nwould hold communion with holy Night and make her perfect, and all her\r\nlamps and voices perfect in their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe silken hangings of the pavilion door, parting as in the portal of\r\na vision, made way for that Queen, fosterling of the most high Gods.\r\nShe paused a step or two beyond the threshold, looking down where those\r\nlords of Demonland, Spitfire and Brandoch Daha, with Gro and Zigg and\r\nAstar, wrapped in their cloaks, lay on the gowany dewy banks that\r\nsloped down to the water’s edge.\r\n\r\n“Asleep,” she whispered. “Even as he within sleepeth against the dawn.\r\nI do think it is only in a great man’s breast sleep hath so gentle a\r\nbed when great events are toward.”\r\n\r\nLike a lily, or like a moonbeam strayed through the leafy roof into a\r\nsilent wood, she stood there, her face uplifted to the starry night\r\nwhere all the air was drenched with the silver radiance of the moon.\r\nAnd now in a soft voice she began supplication to the Gods which are\r\nfrom everlasting, calling upon them in turn by their holy names,\r\nupon gray-eyed Pallas, and Apollo, and Artemis the fleet Huntress,\r\nupon Aphrodite, and Here, Queen of Heaven, and Ares, and Hermes, and\r\nthe dark-tressed Earthshaker. Nor was she afraid to address her holy\r\nprayers to him who from his veiled porch beside Acheron and Lethe Lake\r\nbinds to his will the devils of the under-gloom, nor to the great\r\nFather of All in Whose sight time from the beginning until to-day is\r\nbut the dipping of a wand into the boundless ocean of eternity. So\r\nprayed she to the blessed Gods, most earnestly requiring them that\r\nunder their countenance might be that ride, the like whereof earth had\r\nnot known: the riding of the hippogriff, not rashly and by an ass as\r\nheretofore to his own destruction, but by the man of men who with clean\r\npurpose and resolution undismayed should enforce it carry him to his\r\nheart’s desire.\r\n\r\nNow in the east beyond the feathery hilltops and the great snow wall\r\nof Romshir the gates were opening to the day. The sleepers wakened and\r\nstood up. There was a great noise from within the pavilion. They turned\r\nwide-eyed, and forth of the hangings of the doorway came that young\r\nthing new-hatched, pale and doubtful as the new light which trembled\r\nin the sky. Juss walked beside it, his hand on the sapphire mane. High\r\nand resolute was his look, as he gave good-morrow to the Queen, to his\r\nbrother and his friends. No word they said, only in turn gripped him\r\nby the hand. The hour was upon them. For even as day striding on the\r\neastern snow-fields stormed night out of high heaven, so and with such\r\nswift increase of splendour was might bodily and the desire of the\r\nupper air born in that wild steed. It shone as if lighted by a moving\r\nlamp from withinward, sniffed the sweet morning air and whinnied,\r\npawing the grass of the waterside and tearing it up with its claws of\r\ngold. Juss patted the creature’s arching neck, looked to the bridle he\r\nhad fitted to its mouth, made sure of the fastenings of his armour, and\r\nloosened in the scabbard his great sword. And now up sprang the sun.\r\n\r\nThe Queen said, “Remember: when thou shalt see the lord thy brother in\r\nhis own shape, that is no illusion. Mistrust all else. And the almighty\r\nGods preserve and comfort thee.”\r\n\r\nTherewith the hippogriff, as if maddened with the day-beams, plunged\r\nlike a wild horse, spread wide its rainbow pinions, reared, and took\r\nwing. But the Lord Juss was sprung astride of it, and the grip of his\r\nknees on the ribs of it was like brazen clamps. The firm land seemed\r\nto rush away beneath him to the rear; the lake and the shore and\r\nislands thereof showed in a moment small and remote, and the figures\r\nof the Queen and his companions like toys, then dots, then shrunken to\r\nnothingness, and the vast silence of the upper air opened and received\r\nhim into utter loneliness. In that silence earth and sky swirled like\r\nthe wine in a shaken goblet as the wild steed rocketed higher and\r\nhigher in great spirals. A cloud billowy-white shut in the sky before\r\nthem; brighter and brighter it grew in its dazzling whiteness as they\r\nsped towards it, until they touched it and the glory was dissolved in a\r\ngrey mist that grew still darker and colder as they flew till suddenly\r\nthey emerged from the further side of the cloud into a radiance of\r\nblue and gold blinding in its glory. So for a while they flew with no\r\nset direction, only ever higher, till at length obedient to Juss’s\r\nmastery the hippogriff ceased from his sports and turned obediently\r\nwestward, and so in a swift straight course, mounting ever, sped over\r\nRavary towards the departing night. And now indeed it was as if they\r\nhad verily overtaken night in her western caves. For the air waxed\r\ndarker about them and always darker, until the great peaks that stood\r\nround Ravary were hidden, and all the green land of Zimiamvia, with its\r\nplains and winding waters and hills and uplands and enchanted woods,\r\nhidden and lost in an evil twilight. And the upper heaven was ateem\r\nwith portents: whole armies of men skirmishing in the air, dragons,\r\nwild beasts, bloody streamers, blazing comets, fiery strakes, with\r\nother apparitions innumerable. But all silent, and all cold, so that\r\nJuss’s hands and feet were numbed with the cold and his moustachios\r\nstiff with hoar-frost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIPPOGRIFF IN FLIGHT.]\r\n\r\nBefore them now, invisible till now, loomed the gaunt peak of Zora\r\nRach, black, wintry, and vast, still towering above them for all they\r\nsoared ever higher, grand and lonely above the frozen wastes of the\r\nPsarrion Glaciers. Juss stared at that peak till the wind of their\r\nflight blinded his eyes with tears; but it was yet too far for any\r\nglimpse of that which he hungered to behold: no brazen citadel, no\r\ncoronal of flame, no watcher on the heights. Zora, like some dark\r\nqueen of Hell that disdains that presumptuous mortal eyes should dare\r\nto look lovely on her dread beauties, drew across her brow a veil of\r\nthundercloud. They flew on, and that steel-blue pall of thunderous\r\nvapour rolled forth till it canopied all the sky above them. Juss\r\ntucked his two hands for warmth into the feathery armpits of the\r\nhippogriff’s wings where the wings joined the creature’s body. So\r\nbitter cold it was, his very eyeballs were frozen and fixed; but that\r\npain was a light thing beside somewhat he now felt within him the\r\nlike whereof he never before had known: a death-like horror as of the\r\nhouseless loneliness of naked space, which gripped him at the heart.\r\n\r\nThey landed at last on a crag of black obsidian stone a little below\r\nthe cloud that hid the highest rocks. The hippogriff, couched on the\r\nsteep slope, turned its head to look on Juss. He felt the creature’s\r\nbody beneath him quiver. Its ears were laid back, its eye wide with\r\nterror. “Poor child,” he said. “I have brought thee an ill journey, and\r\nthou but one hour hatched from the egg.”\r\n\r\nHe dismounted; and in that same instant was bereaved. For the\r\nhippogriff with a horse-scream of terror took wing and vanished down\r\nthe mirk air, diving headlong away to eastward, back to the world of\r\nlife and sunlight.\r\n\r\nAnd the Lord Juss stood alone in that region of fear and frost and the\r\nsoul-quailing gloom, under the black summit-rocks of Zora Rach.\r\n\r\nSetting, as the Queen had counselled him to do, his whole heart and\r\nmind on the dread goal he intended, he turned to the icy cliff. As he\r\nclimbed the cold cloud covered him, yet not so thick but he might see\r\nten paces’ distance before and about him as he went. Ill sights enow,\r\nand enow to quail a strong man’s resolution, showed in his path: shapes\r\nof damned fiends and gorgons of the pit running in the way, threatening\r\nhim with death and doom. But Juss, gritting his teeth, climbed on and\r\nthrough them, they being unsubstantial. Then up rose an eldritch cry,\r\n“What man of middle-earth is this that troubleth our quiet? Make an\r\nend! Call up the basilisks. Call up the Golden Basilisk, which bloweth\r\nupon and setteth on fire whatsoever he seeth. Call up the Starry\r\nBasilisk, and whatso he seeth it immediately shrinks up and perisheth.\r\nCall up the Bloody Basilisk, who if he see or touch any living thing it\r\nfloweth away so that nought there remaineth but the bones!”\r\n\r\nThat was a voice to freeze the marrow, yet he pressed on, saying in\r\nhimself, “All is illusion, save that alone she told me of.” And nought\r\nappeared: only the silence and the cold, and the rocks grew ever\r\nsteeper and their ice-glaze more dangerous, and the difficulty like\r\nthe difficulty of those Barriers of Emshir, up which more than two\r\nyears ago he had followed Brandoch Daha and on which he had encountered\r\nand slain the beast mantichora. The leaden hours drifted by, and now\r\nnight shut down, bitter and black and silent. Sore weariness bodily\r\nwas come upon Juss, and his whole soul weary withal and near to death\r\nas he entered a snow-bedded gully that cut deep into the face of the\r\nmountain, there to await the day. He durst not sleep in that freezing\r\nnight; scarcely dared he rest lest the cold should master him, but must\r\nkeep for ever moving and stamping and chafing hands and feet. And yet,\r\nas the slow night crept by, death seemed a desirable thing that should\r\nend such utter weariness.\r\n\r\nMorning came with but a cold alteration of the mist from black to\r\ngray, disclosing the snow-bound rocks silent, dreary, and dead. Juss,\r\nenforcing his half frozen limbs to resume the ascent, beheld a sight of\r\nwoe too terrible for the eye: a young man, helmed and graithed in dark\r\niron, a black-a-moor with goggle-eyes and white teeth agrin, who held\r\nby the neck a fair young lady kneeling on her knees and clasping his\r\nas in supplication, and he most bloodily brandishing aloft his spear\r\nof six foot of length as minded to reave her of her life. This lady,\r\nseeing the Lord Juss, cried out on him for succour very piteously,\r\ncalling him by his name and saying, “Lord Juss of Demonland, have\r\nmercy, and in your triumph over the powers of night pause for an\r\ninstant to deliver me, poor afflicted damosel, from this cruel tyrant.\r\nCan your towering spirit, which hath quarried upon kingdoms, make a\r\nstoop at him? O that should approve you noble indeed, and bless you\r\nfor ever!”\r\n\r\nSurely the very heart of him groaned, and he clapped hand to sword\r\nwishing to right so cruel a wrong. But on the motion he bethought him\r\nof the wiles of evil that dwelt in that place, and of his brother,\r\nand with a great groan passed on. In which instant he beheld sidelong\r\nhow the cruel murtherer smote with his spear that delicate lady, and\r\ndetrenched and cut the two master-veins of her neck, so as she fell\r\ndying in her blood. Juss mounted with a great pace to the head of the\r\ngully, and looking back beheld how black-a-moor and lady both were\r\nchanged to two coiling serpents. And he laboured on, shaken at heart,\r\nyet glad to have so escaped the powers that would have limed him so.\r\n\r\nDarker grew the mist, and heavier the brooding dread which seemed\r\nelemental of the airs about that mountain. Pausing well nigh exhausted\r\non a small stance of snow Juss beheld the appearance of a man armed\r\nwho rolled prostrate in the way, tearing with his nails at the hard\r\nrock and frozen snow, and the snow was all one gore of blood beneath\r\nthe man; and the man besought him in a stifled voice to go no further\r\nbut raise him up and bring him down the mountain. And when Juss, after\r\nan instant’s doubt betwixt pity and his resolve, would have passed by,\r\nthe man cried and said, “Hold, for I am thy very brother thou seekest,\r\nalbeit the King hath by his art framed me to another likeness, hoping\r\nso to delude thee. For thy love sake be not deluded!” Now the voice was\r\nlike to the voice of his brother Goldry, howbeit weak. But the Lord\r\nJuss bethought him again of the words of Sophonisba the Queen, that he\r\nshould see his brother in his own shape and nought else must he trust;\r\nand he thought, “It is an illusion, this also.” So he said, “If that\r\nthou be truly my dear brother, take thy shape.” But the man cried as\r\nwith the voice of the Lord Goldry Bluszco, “I may not, till that I be\r\nbrought down from the mountain. Bring me down, or my curse be upon thee\r\nfor ever.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Juss was torn with pity and doubt and wonder, to hear that\r\nvoice again of his dear brother so beseeching him. Yet he answered and\r\nsaid, “Brother, if that it be thou indeed, then bide till I have won\r\nto this mountain top and the citadel of brass which in a dream I saw,\r\nthat I may know truly thou art not there, but here. Then will I turn\r\nagain and succour thee. But until I see thee in thine own shape I will\r\nmistrust all. For hither I came from the ends of the earth to deliver\r\nthee, and I will set my good on no doubtful cast, having spent so much\r\nand put so much in danger for thy dear sake.”\r\n\r\nSo with a heavy heart he set hand again to those black rocks, iced and\r\nslippery to the touch. Therewith up rose an eldritch cry, “Rejoice,\r\nfor this earth-born is mad! Rejoice, for that was not perfect friend,\r\nthat relinquished his brother at his need!” But Juss climbed on, and by\r\nand by looking back beheld how in that seeming man’s place writhed a\r\ngrisful serpent. And he was glad, so much as gladness might be in that\r\nmountain of affliction and despair.\r\n\r\nNow was his strength near gone, as day drew again toward night and he\r\nclimbed the last crags under the peak of Zora. And he, who had all his\r\ndays drunk deep of the fountain of the joy of life and the glory and\r\nthe wonder of being, felt ever deadlier and darker in his soul that\r\nlonely horror which he first had tasted the day before at his first\r\nnear sight of Zora, while he flew through the cold air portent-laden;\r\nand his whole heart grew sick because of it.\r\n\r\nAnd now he was come to the ring of fire that was about the summit of\r\nthe mountain. He was beyond terror or the desire of life, and trod the\r\nfire as it had been his own home’s threshold. The blue tongues of flame\r\ndied under his foot-tread, making a way before him. The brazen gates\r\nstood wide. He entered in, he passed up the brazen stair, he stood on\r\nthat high roof-floor which he had beheld in dreams, he looked as in\r\na dream on him he had crossed the confines of the dead to find: Lord\r\nGoldry Bluszco keeping his lone watch on the unhallowed heights of\r\nZora. Not otherwise was the Lord Goldry, not by an hairsbreadth, than\r\nas Juss had aforetime seen him on that first night in Koshtra Belorn,\r\nso long ago. He reclined propped on one elbow on that bench of brass,\r\nhis head erect, his eyes fixed as on distant space, viewing the depths\r\nbeyond the star-shine, as one waiting till time should have an end.\r\n\r\nHe turned not at his brother’s greeting. Juss went to him and stood\r\nbeside him. The Lord Goldry Bluszco moved not an eyelid. Juss spoke\r\nagain, and touched his hand. It was stiff and like dank earth. The\r\ncold of it struck through Juss’s body and smote him at the heart. He\r\nsaid in himself, “He is dead.”\r\n\r\nWith that, the horror shut down upon Juss’s soul like madness.\r\nFearfully he stared about him. The cloud had lifted from the mountain’s\r\npeak and hung like a pall above its nakedness. Chill air that was like\r\nthe breath of the whole world’s grave: vast blank cloud-barriers: dim\r\nfar forms of snow and ice, silent, solitary, pale, like mountains of\r\nthe dead: it was as if the bottom of the world were opened and truth\r\nlaid bare: the ultimate Nothing.\r\n\r\nTo hold off the horror from his soul, Juss turned in memory to the\r\ndear life of earth, those things he had most set his heart on, men and\r\nwomen he loved dearest in his life’s days; battles and triumphs of his\r\nopening manhood, high festivals in Galing, golden summer noons under\r\nthe Westmark pines, hunting morns on the high heaths of Mealand; the\r\nday he first backed a horse, of a spring morning in a primrose glade\r\nthat opened on Moonmere, when his small brown legs were scarce the\r\nlength of his fore-arm now, and his dear father held him by the foot as\r\nhe trotted, and showed him where the squirrel had her nest in the old\r\noak tree.\r\n\r\nHe bowed his head as if to avoid a blow, so plain he seemed to hear\r\nsomewhat within him crying with a high voice and loud, “Thou art\r\nnothing. And all thy desires and memories and loves and dreams,\r\nnothing. The little dead earth-louse were of greater avail than thou,\r\nwere it not nothing as thou art nothing. For all is nothing: earth\r\nand sky and sea and they that dwell therein. Nor shall this illusion\r\ncomfort thee, if it might, that when thou art abolished these things\r\nshall endure for a season, stars and months return, and men grow old\r\nand die, and new men and women live and love and die and be forgotten.\r\nFor what is it to thee, that shalt be as a blown-out flame? and all\r\nthings in earth and heaven, and things past and things for to come,\r\nand life and death, and the mere elements of space and time, of being\r\nand not being, all shall be nothing unto thee; because thou shalt be\r\nnothing, for ever.”\r\n\r\nAnd the Lord Juss cried aloud in his agony, “Fling me to Tartarus,\r\ndeliver me to the black infernal Furies, let them blind me, seethe me\r\nin the burning lake. For so should there yet be hope. But in this\r\nhorror of Nothing is neither hope nor life nor death nor sleep nor\r\nwaking, for ever. For ever.”\r\n\r\nIn this black mood of horror he abode for awhile, until a sound of\r\nweeping and wailing made him raise his head, and he beheld a company\r\nof mourners walking one behind another about the brazen floor, all\r\ncloaked in funeral black, mourning the death of Lord Goldry Bluszco.\r\nAnd they rehearsed his glorious deeds and praised his beauty and\r\nprowess and goodliness and strength: soft women’s voices lamenting,\r\nso that the Lord Juss’s soul seemed as he listened to arise again out\r\nof annihilation’s waste, and his heart grew soft again, even unto\r\ntears. He felt a touch on his arm and looking up met the gaze of two\r\neyes gentle as a dove’s, suffused with tears, looking into his from\r\nunder the darkness of that hood of mourning; and a woman’s voice spake\r\nand said, “This is the observable day of the death of the Lord Goldry\r\nBluszco, which hath been dead now a year; and we his fellows in bondage\r\ndo bewail him, as thou mayst see, and shall so bewail him again year by\r\nyear whiles we are on life. And for thee, great lord, must we yet more\r\nsorrowfully lament, since of all thy great works done this is the empty\r\nguerdon, and this the period of thine ambition. But come, take comfort\r\nfor a season, since unto all dominions Fate hath set their end, and\r\nthere is no king on the road of death.”\r\n\r\nSo the Lord Juss, his heart dead within him for grief and despair,\r\nsuffered her take him by the hand and conduct him down a winding\r\nstairway that led from that brazen floor to an inner chamber fragrant\r\nand delicious, lighted with flickering lamps. Surely life and its\r\nturmoils seemed faded to a distant and futile murmur, and the horror of\r\nthe void seemed there but a vain imagination, under the heavy sweetness\r\nof that chamber. His senses swooned; he turned towards his veiled\r\nconductress. She with a sudden motion cast off her mourning cloak, and\r\nstood there, her whole fair body bared to his gaze, open-armed, a sight\r\nto ravish the soul with love and all delight.\r\n\r\nWell nigh had he clasped to his bosom that vision of dazzling\r\nloveliness. But fortune, or the high Gods, or his own soul’s might,\r\nwoke yet again in his drugged brain remembrance of his purpose, so that\r\nhe turned violently from that bait prepared for his destruction, and\r\nstrode from the chamber up to that roof where his dear brother sat as\r\nin death. Juss caught him by the hand: “Speak to me, kinsman. It is I,\r\nJuss. It is Juss, thy brother.”\r\n\r\nBut Goldry moved not neither answered any word.\r\n\r\nJuss looked at the hand resting in his, so like his own to the very\r\nshape of the finger nails and the growth of the hairs on the back of\r\nthe hand and fingers. He let it go, and the arm dropped lifeless.\r\n“It is very certain,” said he, “thou art in a manner frozen, and thy\r\nspirits and understanding frozen and congealed within thee.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he bent to gaze close in Goldry’s eyes, touching his arm and\r\nshoulder. Not a limb stirred, not an eyelid flickered. He caught him\r\nby the hand and sleeve as if to force him up from the bench, calling\r\nhim loudly by his name, shaking him roughly, crying, “Speak to me, thy\r\nbrother, that crossed the world to find thee;” but he abode a dead\r\nweight in Juss’s grasp.\r\n\r\n“If thou be dead,” said Juss, “then am I dead with thee. But till\r\nthen I’ll ne’er think thee dead.” And he sat down on the bench beside\r\nhis brother, taking his hand in his, and looked about him. Nought but\r\nutter silence. Night had fallen, and the moon’s calm radiance and the\r\ntwinkling stars mingled with the pale fires that hedged that mountain\r\ntop in an uncertain light. Hell loosed no more her denizens in the air,\r\nand since the moment when Juss had in that inner chamber shaken himself\r\nfree of that last illusion no presence had he seen nor simulacrum of\r\nman or devil save only Goldry his brother; nor might that horror any\r\nmore master his high heart, but the memory of it was but as the bitter\r\nchill of a winter sea that takes the swimmer’s breath for an instant as\r\nhe plunges first into the icy waters.\r\n\r\nSo with a calm and a steadfast mind the Lord Juss abode there, his\r\nsecond night without sleep, for sleep he dared not in that accursed\r\nplace. But for joy of his found brother, albeit it seemed there was in\r\nhim neither speech nor sight nor hearing, Juss scarce wist of his great\r\nweariness. And he nourished himself with that ambrosia given him by the\r\nQueen, for well he thought the uttermost strength of his body should\r\nnow be tried in the task he now decreed him.\r\n\r\nWhen it was day, he arose and taking his brother Goldry bodily on his\r\nback set forth. Past the gates of brass Juss bore him, and past the\r\nbarriers of flame, and painfully and by slow degrees down the long\r\nnorthern ridge which overhangs the Psarrion Glaciers. All that day,\r\nand the night following, and all the next day after were they on the\r\nmountain, and well nigh dead was Juss for weariness when on the second\r\nday an hour or two before sun-down they reached the moraine. Yet was\r\ntriumph in his heart, and gladness of a great deed done. They lay that\r\nnight in a grove of strawberry trees under the steep foot of a mountain\r\nsome ten miles beyond the western shore of Ravary, and met Spitfire\r\nand Brandoch Daha who had waited with their boat two nights at the\r\nappointed spot, about eventide of the following day.\r\n\r\nNow as soon as Juss had brought him off the mountain, this frozen\r\ncondition of the Lord Goldry was so far thawed that he was able\r\nto stand upon his feet and walk; but never a word might he speak,\r\nand never a look they gat from him, but still his gaze was set and\r\nunchanging, seeming when it rested on his companions to look through\r\nand beyond them as at some far thing seen in a mist. So that each was\r\nsecretly troubled, fearing lest this condition of the Lord Goldry\r\nBluszco should prove remediless, and this that they now received back\r\nfrom prison but the poor remain of him they had so much desired.\r\n\r\nThey came aland and brought him to Sophonisba the Queen where she made\r\nhaste to meet them on the fair lawn before her pavilion. The Queen,\r\nas if knowing beforehand both their case and the remedy thereof, took\r\nby the hand the Lord Juss and said, “O my lord, there yet remaineth a\r\nthing for thee to do to free him throughly, that hast outfaced terrors\r\nbeyond the use of man to bring him back: a little stone indeed to crown\r\nthis building of thine, and yet without it all were in vain, as itself\r\nwere vain without the rest that was all thine: and mine is this last,\r\nand with a pure heart I give it thee.”\r\n\r\nSo saying she made the Lord Juss bow down till she might kiss his\r\nmouth, sweetly and soberly one light kiss. And she said, “This give\r\nunto the lord thy brother.” And Juss did so, kissing his dear brother\r\nin like manner on the mouth; and she said, “Take him, dear my lords.\r\nAnd I have utterly put out the remembrance of these things from his\r\nheart. Take him, and give thanks unto the high Gods because of him.”\r\n\r\nTherewith the Lord Goldry Bluszco looked upon them and upon that fair\r\nQueen and the mountains and the woods and the cool lake’s loveliness,\r\nas a man awakened out of a deep slumber.\r\n\r\nSurely there was joy in all their hearts that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       XXIX: THE FLEET AT MUELVA\r\n\r\n  HOW THE LORDS OF DEMONLAND CAME AGAIN TO THEIR SHIPS AT MUELVA, AND\r\n      THE TIDINGS THEY LEARNED THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor nine days’ space the lords of Demonland abode with Queen Sophonisba\r\nin Koshtra Belorn and beside the Lake of Ravary tasting such high and\r\npure delights as belike none else hath tasted, if it were not the\r\nspirits of the blest in Elysium. When they bade her farewell, the Queen\r\nsaid, “My little martlets shall bring me tidings of you. And when you\r\nshall have brought to mere perdition the wicked regiment of Witchland\r\nand returned again to your dear native land, then is my time for that,\r\nmy Lord Juss, whereof I have often talked to thee and often gladded\r\nmy dreams with the thought thereof: to visit earth again and the\r\nhabitations of men, and be your guest in many-mountained Demonland.”\r\n\r\nJuss kissed her hand and said, “Fail not in this, dear Queen,\r\nwhatsoe’er betide.”\r\n\r\nSo the Queen let bring them by a secret way out upon the high\r\nsnow-fields that are betwixt Koshtra Belorn and Romshir, whence they\r\ncame down into the glen of the dark water that descends from the\r\nglacier of Temarm, and so through many perilous scapes after many days\r\nback by way of the Moruna to Muelva and the ships.\r\n\r\nThere Gaslark and La Fireez, when their greetings were done and their\r\nrejoicings, said to the Lord Juss, “We abide too long time here. We\r\nhave entered the barrel and the bung-hole is stopped.” Therewithal they\r\nbrought him Hesper Golthring, who three days ago sailing to the Straits\r\nfor forage came back again but yesterday with a hot alarum that he met\r\ncertain ships of Witchland: and brought them to battle: and gat one\r\nsunken ere they brake off the fight: and took up certain prisoners. “By\r\nwhose examination,” saith he, “as well as from mine own perceiving and\r\nknowing, it appeareth Laxus holdeth the Straits with eight score ships\r\nof war, the greatest ships that ever the sea bare until this day, come\r\nhither of purpose to destroy us.”\r\n\r\n“Eight score ships?” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “Witchland commandeth not\r\nthe half, nor the third part, of such a strength since we did them down\r\nlast harvest-tide in Aurwath haven. It is not leveable, Hesper.”\r\n\r\nHesper answered him, “Your highness shall find it truth; and more the\r\nsorrow on’t and the wonder.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis the scourings of his subject-allies,” said Spitfire. “We shall\r\nfind them no such hard matter to dispatch after the others.”\r\n\r\nJuss said to the Lord Gro, “What makest thou of these news, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“I think no wonder in it,” answered he. “Witchland is of good memory\r\nand mindeth him of your seamanship off Kartadza. He useth not to\r\nidle, nor to set all on one hazard. Nor comfort not thyself, my Lord\r\nSpitfire, that these be pleasure-galleys borrowed from the soft\r\nBeshtrians or the simple Foliots. They be new ships builded for us, my\r\nlords, and our undoing: it is by no conjecture I say it unto you, but\r\nof mine own knowledge, albeit the number appeareth far greater than ere\r\nI dreamed of. But or ever I sailed with Corinius to Demonland, great\r\nbuildings of an army naval was begun at Tenemos.”\r\n\r\n“I do very well believe,” said King Gaslark, “that none knoweth all\r\nthis better than thou, because thyself didst counsel it.”\r\n\r\n“O Gaslark,” said Lord Brandoch Daha, “must thou still itch to play at\r\nchop-cherry when cherry-time is past? Let him alone. He is our friend\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\n“Eight score ships i’ the Straits,” said Juss. “And ours an hundred.\r\n’Tis well seen what great difference and odds there is betwixt us.\r\nWhich we must needs encounter, or else ne’er sail home again, let alone\r\nto Carcë. For out of this sea is no sea-way for ships, but only by\r\nthese Straits of Melikaphkhaz.”\r\n\r\n“We shall do of Laxus,” said Lord Brandoch Daha, “that he troweth to do\r\nof us.”\r\n\r\nBut Juss was fallen silent, his chin in his hand.\r\n\r\nGoldry Bluszco said, “I would allow him odds and beat him.”\r\n\r\n“It is a great shame in thee, O Juss,” said Brandoch Daha, “if thou\r\nwilt be abashed at this. If that they be in number more than we, what\r\nthen? They are in hope, quarrel, and strength far inferior.”\r\n\r\nBut Juss, still in a study, reached out and caught him by the sleeve,\r\nholding him so a moment or two, and then looked up at him and said,\r\n“Thou art the greatest quarreller, of a friend, that ever I knew, and\r\nif I were an angry man I could not abear thee. May I not three minutes\r\nstudy the means, but thou shalt cry out upon me for a milksop?”\r\n\r\nThey laughed, and the Lord Juss rose up and said, “Call we a council\r\nof war. And let Hesper Golthring be at it, and his skippers that were\r\nwith him o’ that voyage. And pack up the stuff, for we will away o’ the\r\nmorn. If we like not these lettuce, we may pull back our lips. But no\r\nchoice remaineth. If Laxus will deny us sea-room through Melikaphkhaz\r\nStraits, I trow there shall go up thence a crash which when the King\r\nheareth it he shall know it for our first banging on the gates of\r\nCarcë.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     XXX: TIDINGS OF MELIKAPHKHAZ\r\n\r\n  OF NEWS BROUGHT UNTO GORICE THE KING IN CARCË OUT OF THE SOUTH,\r\n      WHERE THE LORD LAXUS LYING IN THE STRAITS WITH HIS ARMADA HELD\r\n      THE FLEET OF DEMONLAND PRISONED IN THE MIDLAND SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a night of late summer leaning towards autumn, eight weeks after\r\nthe sailing of the Demons out of Muelva as is aforewrit, the Lady\r\nPrezmyra sate before her mirror in Corund’s lofty bed-chamber in Carcë.\r\nThe night without was mild and full of stars. Within, yellow flames\r\nof candles burning steadily on either side of the mirror rayed forth\r\ntresses of tinselling brightness in twin glories or luminous spheres\r\nof warmth. In that soft radiance grains as of golden fire swam and\r\ncircled, losing themselves on the confines of the gloom where the massy\r\nfurniture and the arras and the figured hangings of the bed were but\r\ncloudier divisions and congestions of the general dark. Prezmyra’s hair\r\ncaught the beams and imprisoned them in a tawny tangle of splendour\r\nthat swept about her head and shoulders down to the emerald clasps of\r\nher girdle. Her eyes resting idly on her own fair image in the shining\r\nmirror, she talked light nothings with her woman of the bed-chamber\r\nwho, plying the comb, stood behind her chair of gold and tortoiseshell.\r\n\r\n“Reach me yonder book, nurse, that I may read again the words of that\r\nserenade the Lord Gro made for me, the night when first we had tidings\r\nfrom my lord out of Impland of his conquest of that land, and the King\r\ndid make him king thereof.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman gave her the book, that was bound in goatskin chiselled\r\nand ornamented by the gilder’s art, fitted with clasps of gold, and\r\nenriched with little gems, smaragds and margery-pearls, inlaid in the\r\npanels of its covers. Prezmyra turned the page and read:\r\n\r\n    You meaner Beauties of the Night,\r\n      That poorly satisfie our Eies,\r\n    More by your number then your light,\r\n      You Common-people of the Skies;\r\n      What are you when the Moone shall rise?\r\n\r\n    You Curious Chanters of the Wood,\r\n      That warble forth Dame Natures layes,\r\n    Thinking your Passions understood\r\n      By your weake accents; what’s your praise\r\n      When Philomell her voyce shall raise?\r\n\r\n    You Violets that first apeare,\r\n     By your pure purpel mantles knowne,\r\n    Like the proud Virgins of the yeare,\r\n      As if the Spring were all your own;\r\n      What are you when the Rose is blowne?\r\n\r\n    So, when my Princess shall be seene\r\n      In form and Beauty of her mind,\r\n    By Vertue first, then Choyce a Queen,\r\n      Tell me, if she were not design’d\r\n      Th’ Eclypse and Glory of her kind.\r\n\r\nShe abode silent awhile. Then, in a low sweet voice where all the\r\nchords of music seemed to slumber: “Three years will be gone next\r\nYule-tide,” she said, “since first I heard that song. And not yet am I\r\ngrown customed to the style of Queen.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis pity of my Lord Gro,” said the nurse.\r\n\r\n“Thou thinkest?”\r\n\r\n“Mirth sat oftener on your face, O Queen, when he was here, and you\r\nwere used to charm his melancholy and make a pish of his phantastical\r\nhumorous forebodings.”\r\n\r\n“Oft doubting not his forejudgement,” said Prezmyra, “even the while I\r\nthripped my fingers at it. But never saw I yet that the louring thunder\r\nhath that partiality of a tyrant, to blast him that faced it and pass\r\nby him that quailed before it.”\r\n\r\n“He was most deeply bound servant to your beauty,” said the old woman.\r\n“And yet,” she said, viewing her mistress sidelong to see how she would\r\nreceive it, “that were a miss easily made good.”\r\n\r\nShe busied herself with the comb awhile in silence. After a time she\r\nsaid, “O Queen, mistress of the hearts of men, there is not a lord in\r\nWitchland, nor in earth beside, you might not bind your servant with\r\none thread of this hair of yours. The likeliest and the goodliest were\r\nyours at an eye-glance.”\r\n\r\nThe Lady Prezmyra looked dreamily into her own sea-green eyes imaged in\r\nthe glass. Then she smiled mockingly and said, “Whom then accountest\r\nthou the likeliest and the goodliest man in all the stablished earth?”\r\n\r\nThe old woman smiled. “O Queen,” answered she, “this was the very\r\nmatter in dispute amongst us at supper only this evening.”\r\n\r\n“A pretty disputation!” said Prezmyra. “Let me be merry. Who was\r\nadjudged the fairest and gallantest by your high court of censure?”\r\n\r\n“It was not generally determined of, O Queen. Some would have my Lord\r\nGro.”\r\n\r\n“Alack, he is too feminine,” said Prezmyra.\r\n\r\n“Others our Lord the King.”\r\n\r\n“There is none greater,” said Prezmyra, “nor more worshipful. But for\r\nan husband, thou shouldst as well wed with a thunder-storm or the\r\nhungry sea. Give me some more.”\r\n\r\n“Some chose the lord Admiral.”\r\n\r\n“That,” said Prezmyra, “was a nearer stroke. No skipjack nor soft\r\nmarmalady courtier, but a brave, tall, gallant gentleman. Ay, but too\r\nwatery a planet burned at his nativity. He is too like a statua of a\r\nman. No, nurse, thou must bring me better than he.”\r\n\r\nThe nurse said, “True it is, O Queen, that most were of my thinking\r\nwhen I gave ’em my choice: the king of Demonland.”\r\n\r\n“Fie on thee!” cried Prezmyra. “Name him not so that was too unmighty\r\nto hold that land against our enemies.”\r\n\r\n“Folk say it was by foxish arts and practices magical a was spilt on\r\nKrothering Side. Folk say ’twas divels and not horses carried the\r\nDemons down the mountain at us.”\r\n\r\n“They say!” cried Prezmyra. “I say to thee, he hath found it apter to\r\nhis bent to flaunt his crown in Witchland than make ’em give him the\r\nknee in Galing. For a true king both knee and heart do truly bow before\r\nhim. But this one, if he had their knee ’twas in the back side of him\r\nhe had it, to kick him home again.”\r\n\r\n“Fie, madam!” said the nurse.\r\n\r\n“Hold thy tongue, nurse,” said Prezmyra. “It were good ye were all well\r\nwhipped for a bunch of silly mares that know not a horse from an ass.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman watching her in the glass counted it best keep silence.\r\nPrezmyra said under her breath as if talking to herself, “I know a man,\r\nshould not have miscarried it thus.” The old nurse that loved not Lord\r\nCorund and his haughty fashions and rough speech and wine-bibbing, and\r\nwas besides jealous that so rude a stock should wear so rich a jewel as\r\nwas her mistress, followed not her meaning.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, the old woman spake softly and said, “You are full of\r\nthoughts to-night, madam.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra’s eyes met hers in the mirror. “Why may I not be so and it\r\nlikes me?” said she.\r\n\r\nThat stony look of the eyes struck like a gong some twenty-year-old\r\nmemory in the nurse’s heart: the little wilful maiden, ill to goad but\r\ngood to guide, looking out from that Queen’s face across the years. She\r\nknelt down suddenly and caught her arms about her mistress’s waist.\r\n“Why must you wed then, dear heart?” said she, “if you were minded to\r\ndo what likes you? Men love not sad looks in their wives. You may ride\r\na lover on the curb, madam, but once you wed him ’tis all t’other way:\r\nall his way, madam, and beware of ‘had I wist.’”\r\n\r\nHer mistress looked down at her mockingly. “I have been wed seven years\r\nto-night. I should know these things.”\r\n\r\n“And this night!” said the nurse. “And but an hour till midnight, and\r\nyet he sitteth at board.”\r\n\r\nThe Lady Prezmyra leaned back to look again on her own mirrored\r\nloveliness. Her proud mouth sweetened to a smile. “Wilt thou learn me\r\ncommon women’s wisdom?” said she, and there was yet more voluptuous\r\nsweetness trembling in her voice. “I will tell thee a story, as thou\r\nhast told them me in the old days in Norvasp to wile me to bed. Hast\r\nthou not heard tell how old Duke Hilmanes of Maltraëny, among some\r\nother fantasies such as appear by night unto many in divers places,\r\nhad one in likeness of a woman with old face of low and little stature\r\nor body, which did scour his pots and pans and did such things as a\r\nmaid servant ought to do, liberally and without doing of any harm? And\r\nby his art he knew this thing should be his servant still, and bring\r\nunto him whatsoever he would, so long time as he should be glad of the\r\nthings it brought him. But this duke, being a foolish man and a greedy,\r\nmade his familiar bring him at once all the year’s seasons and their\r\nseveral goods and pleasures, and all good things of earth at one time.\r\nSo as in six months’ space, he being sated with these and all good\r\nthings, and having no good thing remaining unto him to expect or to\r\ndesire, for very weariness did hang himself. I would never have ta’en\r\nme an husband, nurse, and I had not known that I was able to give him\r\nevery time I would a new heaven and a new earth, and never the same\r\nthing twice.”\r\n\r\nShe took the old woman’s hands in hers and gathered them to her breast,\r\nas if to let them learn, rocked for a minute in the bountiful infinite\r\nsweetness of that place, what foolish fears were these. Suddenly\r\nPrezmyra clasped the hands tighter in her own, and shuddered a little.\r\nShe bent down to whisper in the nurse’s ear, “I would not wish to die.\r\nThe world without me should be summer without roses. Carcë without me\r\nshould be a night without the star-shine.”\r\n\r\nHer voice died away like the night breeze in a summer garden. In the\r\nsilence they heard the dip and wash of oar-blades from the river\r\nwithout; the sentinel’s challenge, the answer from the ship.\r\n\r\nPrezmyra stood up quickly and went to the window. She could see the\r\nship’s dark bulk by the water-gate, and comings and goings, but nought\r\nclearly. “Tidings from the fleet,” she said. “Put up my hair.”\r\n\r\nAnd ere that was done, came a little page running to her chamber door,\r\nand when it was opened to him, stood panting from his running and said,\r\n“The king your husband bade me tell you, madam, and pray you go down to\r\nhim i’ the great hall. It may be ill news, I fear.”\r\n\r\n“Thou fearest, pap-face?” said the Queen. “I’ll have thee whipped if\r\nthou bringest thy fears to me. Dost know aught? What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“The ship’s much battered, O Queen. He is closeted with our Lord the\r\nKing, the skipper. None dare speak else. ’Tis feared the high Admiral——”\r\n\r\n“Feared!” cried she, swinging round for the nurse to put about her\r\nwhite shoulders her mantle of sendaline and cloth of silver, that\r\nshimmered at the collar with purple amethysts and was scented with\r\ncedar and galbanum and myrrh. She was forth in the dark corridor,\r\ndown by the winding marble stair, through the mid-court, hasting to\r\nthe banquet hall. The court was full of folk talking; but nought\r\ncertain, nought save suspense and wonder; rumour of a great sea-fight\r\nin the south, a mighty victory won by Laxus upon the Demons: Juss and\r\nthose lords of Demonland dead and gone, the captives following with\r\nthe morning’s tide. And here and there like an undertone to these\r\ntriumphant tidings, contrary rumours, whispered low, like the hissing\r\nof an adder from her shadowy lair: all not well, the lord Admiral\r\nwounded, half his ships lost, the battle doubtful, the Demons escaped.\r\nSo came that lady into the great hall; and there were the lords and\r\ncaptains of the Witches all in a restless quiet of expectation. Duke\r\nCorsus lolled forward in his seat down by the cross-bench, his breath\r\nstertorous, his small eyes fixed in a drunken stare. On the other\r\nside Corund sate huge and motionless, his elbow propped on the table,\r\nhis chin in his hand, sombre and silent, staring at the wall. Others\r\ngathered in knots, talking in low tones. The Lord Corinius walked up\r\nand down behind the cross-bench, his hands clasped behind him, his\r\nfingers snapping impatiently at whiles, his heavy jaw held high, his\r\nglance high and defiant. Prezmyra came to Heming where he stood among\r\nthree or four and touched him on the arm. “We know nothing, madam,” he\r\nsaid. “He is with the King.”\r\n\r\nShe came to her lord. “Thou didst send for me.”\r\n\r\nCorund looked up at her. “Why, so I did, madam. Tidings from the fleet.\r\nMaybe somewhat, maybe nought. But thou’dst best be here for’t.”\r\n\r\n“Good tidings or ill: that shaketh not Carcë walls,” said she.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the low buzz of talk was hushed. The King stood in the\r\ncurtained doorway. They rose up all to meet him, all save Corsus that\r\nsat drunk in his chair. The crown of Witchland shed baleful sparkles\r\nabove the darkness of the dark fortress-face of Gorice the King, the\r\nglitter of his dread eyeballs, the deadly line of his mouth, the square\r\nblack beard jutting beneath. Like a tower he stood, and behind him in\r\nthe shadow was the messenger from the fleet with countenance the colour\r\nof wet mortar.\r\n\r\nThe King spake and said, “My lords, here’s tidings touching the truth\r\nwhereof I have well satisfied myself. And it importeth the mere\r\nperdition of my fleet. There hath been battle off Melikaphkhaz in the\r\nImpland seas. Juss hath sunken our ships, every ship save that which\r\nbrought the tidings, sunk, with Laxus and all his men that were with\r\nhim.” He paused: then, “These be heavy news,” he said, “and I’ll have\r\nyou bear ’em in the old Witchland fashion: the heavier hit the heavier\r\nstrike again.”\r\n\r\nIn the strange deformed silence came a little gasping cry, and the Lady\r\nSriva fell a-swooning.\r\n\r\nThe King said, “Let the kings of Impland and of Demonland attend me.\r\nThe rest, it is commanded that all do get them to bed o’ the instant.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Corund said in his lady’s ear as he went by, taking her with\r\nhis hand about the shoulder, “What, lass? if the broth’s spilt, the\r\nmeat remaineth. To bed with thee, and never doubt we’ll pay them yet.”\r\n\r\nAnd he with Corinius followed the King.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIt was past middle night when the council brake up, and Corund sought\r\nhis chamber in the eastern gallery above the inner court. He found his\r\nlady sitting yet at the window, watching the false dawn over Pixyland.\r\nDismissing his lamp-bearers that lighted him to bed, he bolted and\r\nbarred the great iron-studded door. The breadth of his shoulders when\r\nhe turned filled the shadowy doorway; his head well nigh touched the\r\nlintel. It was hard to read his countenance in the uncertain gloom\r\nwhere he stood beyond the bright region made by the candle-light, but\r\nPrezmyra’s eyes could mark how care sat on his brow, and there was in\r\nthe carriage of his ponderous frame kingliness and the strength of some\r\nstrong determination.\r\n\r\nShe stood up, looking up at him as on a mate to whom she could be true\r\nand be true to her own self. “Well?” she said.\r\n\r\n“The tables are set,” said he, without moving. “The King hath named me\r\nhis captain general in Carcë.”\r\n\r\n“Is it come to that?” said Prezmyra.\r\n\r\n“They have hewn a limb from us,” answered he. “They have wit to know\r\nthe next stroke should be at the heart.”\r\n\r\n“Is it truly so?” said she. “Eight thousand men? twice thine army’s\r\nstrength that won Impland for us? all drowned?”\r\n\r\n“’Twas the devilish seamanship of these accursed Demons,” said Corund.\r\n“It appeareth Laxus held the Straits where they must go if ever they\r\nshould win home again, meaning to fight ’em in the narrows and so crush\r\n’em with the weight of’s ships as easy as kill flies, having by a great\r\nodds the bigger strength both in ships and men. They o’ their part kept\r\nthe sea without, trying their best to ’tice him forth so they might do\r\ntheir sailor tricks i’ the open. A week or more he withstood it, till\r\no’ the ninth day (the devil curse him for a fool, wherefore could a\r\nnot have had patience?) o’ the ninth morning, weary of inaction and\r\nhaving wind and tide something in his favour”; the Lord Corund groaned\r\nand snapped his fingers contemptuously. “O I’ll tell thee the tale\r\nto-morrow, madam. I’m surfeited with it to-night. The sum is, Laxus\r\ndrownded and all that were with him, and Juss with his whole great\r\narmament northward bound for Witchland.”\r\n\r\n“And the wide seas his. And we expect him, any day?”\r\n\r\n“The wind hangeth easterly. Any day,” said Corund.\r\n\r\nPrezmyra said, “That was well done to rest the command in thee. But\r\nwhat of our qualified young gentleman who had that office aforetime.\r\nWill he play o’ these terms?”\r\n\r\nCorund answered, “Hungry dogs will eat dirty puddings. I think he’ll\r\nplay, albeit he showed his teeth i’ the first while.”\r\n\r\n“Let him keep his teeth for the Demons,” said she.\r\n\r\n“This very ship was ta’en,” said Corund, “and sent home by them in a\r\nbravado to tell us what betid: a stupid insolent part, shall cost ’em\r\ndear, for it hath forewarned us. The skipper had this letter for thee:\r\ngave it me monstrous secretly.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra took away the wax and opened the letter, and knew the writer\r\nof it. She held it out to Corund: “Read it to me, my lord. I am tired\r\nwith watching; I read ill by this flickering candle-light.”\r\n\r\nBut he said, “I am too poor a scholar, madam. I prithee read it.”\r\n\r\nAnd in the light of the guttering candles, vexed with an east wind\r\nthat blew before the dawn, she read this letter, that was conceived in\r\nmanner following:\r\n\r\n  “Unto the right high mighti and doubtid Prynsace the Quen of\r\n  Implande, one that was your Servaunt but now beinge both a Traitor\r\n  and a manifald parjured Traitor, which Heaven above doth abhorre,\r\n  the erth below detest, the sun moone and starres be eschamed of,\r\n  and all Creatures doo curse and ajudge unworthy of breth and life,\r\n  do wish onelie to die your Penytent.

Therefore most aernestly I\r\n  do beseek your Magestie and your nowble Lorde that was my Frend\r\n  before that by my venemous tresun I loste both you and him and\r\n  alle, take order for your proper saffetie, and the thinge requyers\r\n  Haste of your Magestes. And this must you doo, to fare strayght way\r\n  into your owne cuntrie of Picselande and there raise Force. Be you\r\n  before these rebalds and obstynates of Demounlande in their Prowd\r\n  Attempts, to strike at Wychlande and so purchas their Frenshyp who\r\n  it is verie sertan will in powre invintiable stand before Carsee\r\n  or ever Wychlande shall have time to putt you downe. This Counsell\r\n  I give you knowinge full well that the Power and Domynyon of the\r\n  Demouns standeth now preheminent and not to be withstode. So tarry\r\n  not by a Sinckinge Schippe, but do as I saye lest all bee loste.\r\n\r\n  “One thinge more I telle you, that shall haply enforce my counsell\r\n  unto you, the hevyeste Newes of alle.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis heavy news that such a false troker as he is should yet supervive\r\nso many honest men,” said Corund.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Prezmyra held out the letter to her lord. “Mine eyes dazzle,”\r\nshe said. “Read thou the rest.” Corund put his great arm about her as\r\nhe sat down to the table before the mirror and pored over the writing,\r\nspelling it out with one finger. He had little book-learning, and it\r\nwas some time ere he had the meaning clear. He did not read it out; his\r\nlady’s face told him she had read all ere he began.\r\n\r\nThis was the last news Gro’s letter told her: the Prince her brother\r\ndead in the sea-fight, fighting for Demonland; dead and drowned in the\r\nsea off Melikaphkhaz.\r\n\r\nPrezmyra went to the window. Dawn was beginning, bleak and gray. After\r\na minute she turned her head. Like a she-lion she looked, proud and\r\ndangerous-eyed. She was very pale. Her accents, level and quiet, called\r\nto the blood like the roll of a distant drum, as she said, “Succours of\r\nDemonland: late or never.”\r\n\r\nCorund beheld her uneasily.\r\n\r\n“Their oaths to me and to him!” said she, “sworn to us that night in\r\nCarcë. False friends! O, I could eat their hearts with garlic.”\r\n\r\nHe put his great hands on her two shoulders. She threw them off. “In\r\none thing,” she cried, “Gro counselleth us well: to tarry no more on\r\nthis sinking ship. We must raise forces. But not as he would have it,\r\nto uphold these Demons, these oath-breakers. We must away this night.”\r\n\r\nHer lord had cast aside his great wolfskin mantle. “Come, madam,” said\r\nhe, “to bed’s our nearest journey.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra answered, “I’ll not to bed. It shall be seen now, O Corund, if\r\nthat thou be a king indeed.”\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the bed’s edge and fell to doing off his boots. “Well,”\r\nhe said, “every one as he likes, as the good-man said when he kissed\r\nhis cow. Day’s near dawning; I must be up betimes, and a sleepless\r\nnight’s a poor breeder of invention.”\r\n\r\nBut she stood over him, saying, “It shall be seen if thou be a true\r\nking. And be not deceived: if thou fail me here I’ll have no more of\r\nthee. This night we must away. Thou shalt raise Pixyland, which is now\r\nmine by right: raise power in thine own vast kingdom of Impland. Fling\r\nWitchland to the winds. What care I if she sink or swim? This only is\r\nthe matter: to punish these vile perjured Demons, enemies of ours and\r\nenemies of all the world.”\r\n\r\n“We need ride o’ no journey for that,” said Corund, still putting off\r\nhis boots. “Thou shalt shortly see Juss and his brethren before Carcë\r\nwith three score hundred fighting men at’s back. Then cometh the metal\r\nto the anvil. Come, come, thou must not weep.”\r\n\r\n“I do not weep,” said she. “Nor I shall not weep. But I’ll not be ta’en\r\nin Carcë like a mouse in a trap.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad thou’lt not weep, madam. It is as great pity to see a woman\r\nweep as a goose to go barefoot. Come, be not foolish. We must not part\r\nforces now. We must bide this storm in Carcë.”\r\n\r\nBut she cried, “There is a curse on Carcë. Gro is lost to us and his\r\ngood counsel. Dear my lord, I see something wicked that like a thick\r\ndark shadow shadoweth all the sky above us. What place is there not\r\nsubject to the power and regiment of Gorice the King? but he is too\r\nproud: we be all too insolent overweeners of our own works. Carcë\r\nhath grown too great, and the Gods be offended at us. The insolent\r\nvileness of Corinius, the old dotard Corsus that must still be at his\r\nboosing-can, these and our own private quarrels in Carcë must be our\r\nbane. Repugn not therefore against the will of the Gods, but take the\r\nhelm in thine own hand ere it be too late.”\r\n\r\n“Tush, madam,” said he, “these be but fray-bugs. Daylight shall make\r\nthee laugh at ’em.”\r\n\r\nBut Prezmyra, queening it no longer, caught her arms about his neck.\r\n“The odd man to perform all perfectly is thou. Wilt thou see us rushing\r\non this whirlpool and not swim for it ere it be too late?” And she said\r\nin a choked voice, “My heart is near broke already. Do not break it\r\nutterly. Only thou art left now.”\r\n\r\nThe chill dawn, the silent room, the guttering candles, and that\r\nhigh-hearted lady of his, daunted for an instant from her noble and\r\nequal courage, cowering like a bird in his embrace: these things were\r\nlike an icy breath that passed by and quailed him for a moment. He took\r\nher by her two hands and held her off from him. She held her head high\r\nagain, albeit her cheek was blanched; he felt the brave comrade-grip of\r\nher hands in his.\r\n\r\n“Dear lass,” he said, “I cast me not to be odd with none of these spawn\r\nof Demonland. Here is my hand, and the hand of my sons, heavy while\r\nbreath remaineth us against Demonland for thee and for the King. But\r\nsith our lord the King hath made me a king, come wind, come weet, we\r\nmust weather it in Carcë. True is that saw, ‘For fame one maketh a\r\nking, not for long living.’”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra thought in her heart that these were fey words. But having now\r\nput behind her hope and fear, she was resolved to kick against the wind\r\nno more, but stand firm and see what Destiny would do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     XXXI: THE DEMONS BEFORE CARCË\r\n\r\n  HOW GORICE THE KING, ALBEIT SO STRONG A SORCERER, ELECTED THAT BY\r\n      THE SWORD, AND CHIEFLY BY THE LORD CORUND HIS CAPTAIN GENERAL,\r\n      SHOULD BE DETERMINED AS FOR THIS TIME THE EVENT OF THESE HIGH\r\n      MATTERS; AND HOW THOSE TWAIN, THE KING AND THE LORD JUSS, SPAKE\r\n      FACE TO FACE AT LAST; AND OF THE BLOODY BATTLE BEFORE CARCË,\r\n      AND WHAT FRUIT WAS GARNERED THERE AND WHAT MADE RIPE AGAINST\r\n      HARVEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nGorice the King sate in his chamber the thirteenth morning after these\r\ntidings brought to Carcë. On the table under his hand were papers of\r\naccount and schedules of his armies and their equipment. Corund sate at\r\nthe King’s right hand, and over against him Corinius.\r\n\r\nCorund’s great hairy hands were clasped before him on the table. He\r\nspoke without book, resting his gaze on the steady clouds that sailed\r\nacross the square of sky seen through the high window that faced him.\r\n“Of Witchland and the home provinces, O King, nought but good. All the\r\ncompanies of soldiers which were appointed to repair to this part by\r\nthe tenth of the month are now come hither, save some bands of spearmen\r\nfrom the south, and some from Estreganzia. These last I expect to-day;\r\nViglus writeth they come with him with the heavy troops from Baltary\r\nI sent him to assemble. So is the muster full as for these parts:\r\nThramnë, Zorn, Permio, the land of Ar, Trace, Buteny, and Estremerine.\r\nOf the subject allies, there’s less good there. The kings of Mynia\r\nand Gilta: Olis of Tecapan: County Escobrine of Tzeusha: the king of\r\nEllien: all be here with their contingents. But there’s mightier names\r\nwe miss. Duke Maxtlin of Azumel hath flung off’s allegiance and cut\r\noff your envoy’s ears, O King; ’tis thought for some supposed light\r\npart of the sons of Corsus done to his sister. That docketh us thirty\r\nscore stout fighters. The lord of Eushtlan sendeth no answer, and now\r\nare we advertised by Mynia and Gilta of his open malice and treason,\r\nwho did stubbornly let them the way hither through his country while\r\nthey hastened to do your majesty’s commands. Then there’s the Ojedian\r\nlevies, should be nigh a thousand spears, ten days overdue. Heming,\r\nthat raiseth Pixyland in Prezmyra’s name, will bring them in if he may.\r\nWho also hath order, being on his way, to rouse Maltraëny to action,\r\nfrom whom no word as yet; and I do fear treachery in ’em, Maltraëny and\r\nOjedia both, they have been so long of coming. King Barsht of Toribia\r\nsendeth flat refusal.”\r\n\r\n“It is known to you besides, O King,” said Corinius, “that the king of\r\nNevria came in last night, many days past the day appointed, and but\r\nhalf his just complement.”\r\n\r\nThe King drew back his lips. “I will not dash his spirits by blaming\r\nhim at this present. Later, I’ll have that king’s head for this.”\r\n\r\n“This is the sum,” said Corund. “Nay, then, I had forgot the Red Foliot\r\nwith’s folk, three hundred perchance, came in this morning.”\r\n\r\nCorinius thrust out his tongue and laughed: “One hen-lobster such as he\r\nshall scarce afford a course for this banquet.”\r\n\r\n“He keepeth faith,” said Corund, “where bigger men turn dastards. ’Tis\r\nseen now that these forced leagues be as sure as they were sealed with\r\nbutter. Your majesty will doubtless give him audience.”\r\n\r\nThe King was silent awhile, studying his papers. “What strength to-day\r\nin Carcë?” he asked.\r\n\r\nCorund answered him, “As near as may be two score hundred foot and\r\nfifty score horse: five thousand in all. And, that I weigh most, O\r\nKing, big broad strong set lads of Witchland nigh every jack of ’em.”\r\n\r\nThe King said, “’Twas not well done, O Corund, to bid thy son delay\r\nfor Ojedia and Maltraëny. He might else have been in Carcë now with a\r\nthousand Pixylanders to swell our strength.”\r\n\r\n“I did that I did,” answered Corund, “seeking only your good, O King.\r\nA few days’ delay might buy us a thousand spears.”\r\n\r\n“Delay,” said the King, “hath favoured mine enemy. This we should have\r\ndone: at his first landing give him no time but wink, set on him with\r\nall our forces, and throw him into the sea.”\r\n\r\n“If luck go with us that may yet be,” said Corund.\r\n\r\nThe King’s nostrils widened. He crouched forward, glaring at Corund\r\nand Corinius, his jaw thrust out so that the stiff black beard on\r\nit brushed the papers on the table before him. “The Demons,” said\r\nhe, “landed i’ the night at Ralpa. They come on with great journeys\r\nnorthward. Will be here ere three days be spent.”\r\n\r\nBoth they grew red as blood. Corund spake: “Who told you these tidings,\r\nO King?”\r\n\r\n“Care not thou for that,” said the King. “Enough for thee, I know it.\r\nHath it ta’en you napping?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered he. “These ten days past we have been ready, with what\r\nstrength we might make, to receive ’em, come they from what quarter\r\nthey will. So it is, though, that while we lack the Pixyland succours\r\nJuss hath by some odds the advantage over us, if, as our intelligence\r\nsaith, six thousand fighting men do follow him, and these forced\r\nbesides with some that should be ours.”\r\n\r\n“Thou wouldst,” said the King, “await these out of Pixyland, with what\r\nelse Heming may gather, afore we offer them battle?”\r\n\r\nSaid Corund, “That would I. We must look beyond the next turn of the\r\nroad, O my Lord the King.”\r\n\r\n“That would not I,” said Corinius.\r\n\r\n“That is stoutly said, Corinius,” said the King. “Yet remember, thou\r\nhadst the greater force on Krothering Side, yet wast overborne.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis that standeth in my mind, Lord,” said Corund. “For well I know,\r\nhad I been there I’d a fared no better.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Corinius, whose brow had darkened with the naming of his\r\ndefeat, looked cheerfully now and said, “I pray you but consider, O\r\nmy Lord the King, that here at home is no room for such a sleight or\r\ngin as that whereby in their own country they took me. When Juss and\r\nBrandoch Daha and their stinking gaberlunzies do cry huff at us on\r\nWitchland soil, ’tis time to give ’em a choke-pear. Which with your\r\nleave, Lord, I will promise now to do, other else to lose my life.”\r\n\r\n“Give me thy hand,” said Corund. “Of all men else would I a chosen thee\r\nfor such a day as this, and (were’t to-day to meet the whole power of\r\nDemonland in arms) to stand perdue with thee for this bloody service.\r\nBut let us hear the King’s commands: which way soe’er he choose, we\r\nshall do it right gladly.”\r\n\r\nGorice the King sat silent. One lean hand rested on the iron\r\nserpent-head of his chair’s arm, the other, with finger outstretched\r\nagainst the jutting cheekbone, supported his chin. Only in the deep\r\nshadow of his eye-sockets a lambent light moved. At length he started,\r\nas if the spirit, flown to some unsounded gulfs of time or space, had\r\nin that instant returned to its mortal dwelling. He gathered the papers\r\nin a heap and tossed them to Corund.\r\n\r\n“Too much lieth on it,” said he. “He that hath many peas may put more\r\nin the pot. But now the day approacheth when I and Juss must cast up\r\nour account together, and one or all shall be brought to death and\r\nbane.” He stood up from his chair and looked down on those two, his\r\nchosen captains, great men of war raised up by him to be kings over two\r\nquarters of the world. They watched him like little birds under the eye\r\nof a snake. “The country hereabout,” said the King, “is not good for\r\nhorsemanship, and the Demons be great horsemen. Carcë is strong, and\r\nnever can it be forced by assault. Also under mine eye should my men of\r\nWitchland acquit themselves to do the greatest deeds. Therefore will we\r\nabide them here in Carcë, until young Heming come and his levies out\r\nof Pixyland. Then shall ye fall upon them and never make an end till\r\nthe land be utterly purged of them, and all the lords of Demonland be\r\nslain.”\r\n\r\nCorinius said, “To hear is to obey, O King. Howsoever, not to dissemble\r\nwith you, I’d liever at ’em at once, ’stead of let them sit awhile and\r\nrefresh their army. Occasion is a wanton wench, O King, that is quick\r\nto beckon another man if one look coldly on her. Moreover, Lord, could\r\nyou not by your art, in small time, with certain compositions?——”\r\n\r\nBut the King brake in upon him saying, “Thou knowest not what thou\r\nspeakest. There is thy sword; there thy men; these my commands. See\r\nthou perform them punctually when time shall come.”\r\n\r\n“Lord,” said Corinius, “you shall not find me wanting.” Therewith he\r\ndid obeisance and went forth from before the King.\r\n\r\nThe King said unto Corund, “Thou hast manned him well, this\r\ntassel-gentle. There was some danger he should so mislike subjection\r\nunto thee in these acts martial as it should breed some quarrel should\r\nlittle speed our enterprise.”\r\n\r\n“Think not you that, O King,” answered Corund. “’Tis grown like an\r\nalmanac for the past year, past date. A will feed out of my hand now.”\r\n\r\n“Because thou hast carried it with him,” said the King, “in so\r\nhonourable and open plainness. Hold on the road thou hast begun, and be\r\nmindful still that into thine hand is given the sword of Witchland, and\r\ntherein have I put my trust for this great hour.”\r\n\r\nCorund looked upon the King with gray and quick eyes shining like unto\r\nthe eagle’s. He slapped his heavy sword with the flat of his hand:\r\n“’Tis a tough fox, O my Lord the King; will not fail his master.”\r\n\r\nTherewith, glad at the King’s gracious words, he did obeisance unto the\r\nKing and went forth from the chamber.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe same night there appeared in the sky impending over Carcë a blazing\r\nstar with two bushes. Corund beheld it in an open space betwixt the\r\nclouds as he went to his chamber. He said nought of it to his lady\r\nwife, lest it should trouble her; but she too had from her window seen\r\nthat star, yet spake not of it to her lord for a like reason.\r\n\r\nAnd King Gorice, sitting in his chamber with his baleful books, beheld\r\nthat star and its fiery streamers, which the King rather noted than\r\nliked. For albeit he might not know of a certain what way that sign\r\nintended, yet was it apparent to one so deeply learned in nigromancy\r\nand secrets astronomical that this thing was fatal, being of those\r\nprodigies and ominous prognosticks which fore-run the tragical ends of\r\nnoble persons and the ruins of states.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe third day following, watchmen beheld from Carcë walls in the\r\npale morning the armies of the Demons that filled the whole plain\r\nto southward. But of the succours out of Pixyland was as yet no sign\r\nat all. Gorice the King, according as he had determined, held all\r\nhis power quiet within the fortress. But for passing of the time,\r\nand because it pleased his mind to speak yet face to face with the\r\nLord Juss before this last mortal trial in arms should be begun\r\nbetwixt them, the King sent Cadarus as his herald with flags of truce\r\nand olive-branches into the Demons’ lines. By which mission it was\r\nconcluded that the Demons should withdraw their armies three bowshots\r\nfrom the walls, and they of Witchland should abide all within the hold;\r\nonly the King with fourteen of his folk unarmed and Juss with a like\r\nnumber unarmed should come forth into the midst of the bateable ground\r\nand there speak together. And this meeting must be at the third hour\r\nafter noon.\r\n\r\nSo either party came to this parley at the hour appointed. Juss went\r\nbare-headed but, save for that, all armed in his shining byrny with\r\ngorget and shoulder-plates damasked and embossed with wires of gold,\r\nand golden leg-harness, and rings of red gold upon his wrists. His\r\nkirtle was of wine-dark silken tissue, and he wore that dusky cloak the\r\nsylphs had made for him, the collar whereof was stiff with broidery\r\nand strange beasts worked thereon in silver thread. According to the\r\ncompact he bare no weapon; only in his hand a short ivory staff inlaid\r\nwith precious stones, and the head of it a ball of that stone which\r\nmen call Belus’ eye, that is white and hath within it a black apple,\r\nthe midst whereof a man shall see to glitter like gold. Very masterful\r\nand proud he stood before the King, carrying his head like a stag that\r\nsniffs the morning. His brethren and Brandoch Daha remained a pace\r\nor two behind him, with King Gaslark and the lords Zigg and Gro, and\r\nMelchar and Tharmrod and Styrkmir, Quazz with his two sons, and Astar,\r\nand Bremery of Shaws: goodly men and lordly to look on, unweaponed all;\r\nand wondrous was the sparkle of their jewels that were on them.\r\n\r\nOver against them, attending on the King, were these: Corund king of\r\nImpland, and Corinius called king of Demonland, Hacmon and Viglus\r\nCorund’s sons, Duke Corsus and his sons Dekalajus and Gorius, Eulien\r\nking of Mynia, Olis lord of Tecapan, Duke Avel of Estreganzia, the Red\r\nFoliot, Erp the king of Ellien, and the counts of Thramnë and Tzeusha;\r\nunweaponed, but armoured to the throat, big men and strong the most of\r\nthem and of lordly bearing, yet none to match with Corinius and Corund.\r\n\r\nThe King, in his mantle of cobra-skins, his staff-royal in his hand,\r\ntopped by half a head all those tall men about him, friend and foe\r\nalike. Lean and black he towered amongst them, like a thunder-blasted\r\npine-tree seen against the sunset.\r\n\r\nSo, in the golden autumn afternoon, in the midst of that sad main of\r\nsedgelands where between slimy banks the weed-choked Druima deviously\r\nwinds toward the sea, were those two men met together for whose\r\nambition and their pride the world was too little a place to contain\r\nthem both and peace lying between them. And like some drowsy dragon of\r\nthe elder slime, squat, sinister, and monstrous, the citadel of Carcë\r\nslept over all.\r\n\r\nBy and by the King spake and said: “I sent for thee because I think it\r\ngood I and thou should talk together while yet is time for talking.”\r\n\r\nJuss answered, “I quarrel not with that, O King.”\r\n\r\n“Thou,” said the King, bending his brow upon him, “art a man wise and\r\nfearless. I counsel thee, and all these that be with thee, turn back\r\nfrom Carcë. Well I see the blood thou didst drink in Melikaphkhaz will\r\nnot allay thy thirst, and war is to thee thy pearl and thy paramour.\r\nYet, if it be, turn back from Carcë. Thou standest now on the pinnacle\r\nof thine ambition; wilt leap higher, thou fall’st in the abyss. Let the\r\nfour corners of the earth be shaken with our wars, but not this centre.\r\nFor here shall no man gather fruit, but and if it be death he gather;\r\nor if, then this fruit only, that Zoacum, that fruit of bitterness,\r\nwhich when he shall have tasted of, all the bright lights of heaven\r\nshall become as darkness and all earth’s goodness as ashes in his mouth\r\nall his life’s days until he die.”\r\n\r\nHe paused. The Lord Juss stood still, quailing not at all beneath that\r\ndreadful gaze. His company behind him stirred and whispered. Lord\r\nBrandoch Daha, with mockery in his eye, said somewhat to Goldry Bluszco\r\nunder his breath.\r\n\r\nBut the King spake again to the Lord Juss, “Be not deceived. These\r\nthings I say unto thee not as labouring to scare you from your set\r\npurpose with frights and fairy-babes: I know your quality too well.\r\nBut I have read signs in heaven: nought clear, but threatful unto both\r\nyou and me. For thy good I say it, O Juss, and again (for that our last\r\nspeech leaveth the firmest print) be advised: turn back from Carcë or\r\nit be too late.”\r\n\r\nLord Juss harkened attentively to the words of Gorice the King, and\r\nwhen he had ended, answered and said, “O King, thou hast given us\r\nterrible good counsel. But it was riddlewise. And hearing thee, mine\r\neye was still on the crown thou wearest, made in the figure of a\r\ncrab-fish, which, because it looks one way and goes another, methought\r\ndid fitly pattern out thy looking to our perils but seeking the while\r\nthine own advantage.”\r\n\r\nThe King gave him an ill look, saying, “I am thy lord paramount. With\r\nsubjects it sits not to use this familiar style unto their King.”\r\n\r\nJuss answered, “Thou dost thee and thou me. And indeed it were folly in\r\neither of us twain to bend knee to t’other, when the lordship of all\r\nthe earth waiteth on the victor in our great contention. Thou hast been\r\nopen with me, Witchland, to let me know thou art uneager to strike a\r\nfield with us. I will be open too, and I will make an offer unto thee,\r\nand this it is: that we will depart out of thy country and do no more\r\nunpeaceful deeds against thee (till thou provoke us again); and thou,\r\nof thy part, of all the land of Demonland shalt give up thy quarrel,\r\nand of Pixyland and Impland beside, and shalt yield me up Corsus and\r\nCorinius thy servants that I may punish them for the beastly deeds they\r\ndid in our land whenas we were not there to guard it.”\r\n\r\nHe ceased, and for a minute they beheld each other in silence. Then the\r\nKing lifted up his chin and smiled a dreadful smile.\r\n\r\nCorinius whispered mockingly in his ear, “Lord, you may lightly give\r\n’em Corsus. That were easy composition, and false coin too methinks.”\r\n\r\n“Stand back i’ thy place,” said the King, “and hold thy peace.” And\r\nunto Lord Juss he said, “Of all ensuing harm the cause is in thee; for\r\nI am now resolved never to put up my sword until of thy bleeding head\r\nI may make a football. And now, let the earth be afraid, and Cynthia\r\nobscure her shine: no more words but mum. Thunder and blood and night\r\nmust usurp our parts, to complete and make up the catastrophe of this\r\ngreat piece.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThat night the King waked late in his chamber in the Iron Tower alone.\r\nThese three years past he had seldom resorted thither, and then\r\ncommonly but to bear away some or other of his books to study in his\r\nown lodging. His jars and flasks and bottles of blue and green and\r\npurple glass wherein he kept his cursed drugs and electuaries of secret\r\ncomposition, his athals and athanors, his crucibles, his horsebellied\r\nretorts and alembics and bains-maries, stood arow on shelves coated\r\nwith dust and hung about with the dull spider’s weavings; the furnace\r\nwas cold; the glass of the windows was clouded with dirt; the walls\r\nwere mildewed; the air of the chamber fusty and stagnant. The King was\r\ndeep in his contemplation, with a big black book open before him on\r\nthe six-sided reading-stand: the damnablest of all his books, the same\r\nwhich had taught him aforetime what he must do when by the wicked power\r\nof enchantment he had wanted but a little to have confounded Demonland\r\nand all the lords thereof in death and ruin.\r\n\r\nThe open page under his hand was of parchment discoloured with age, and\r\nthe writing on the page was in characters of ancient out-of-fashion\r\ncrabbedness, heavy and black, and the great initial letters and the\r\nilluminated borders were painted and gilded in dark and fiery hues\r\nwith representations of dreadful faces and forms of serpents and\r\ntoad-faced men and apes and mantichores and succubi and incubi and\r\nobscene representations and figures of unlawful meaning. These were the\r\nwords of the writing on the page which the King conned over and over,\r\nfalling again into a deep study betweenwhiles, and then conning these\r\nwords again of an age-old prophetic writing touching the preordinate\r\ndestinies of the royal house of Gorice in Carcë:\r\n\r\n    Soo schel your hous stonde and bee\r\n    Unto eternytee\r\n    Yet walke warilie\r\n    Wyttinge ful sarteynlee\r\n    That if impiouslie\r\n    The secounde tyme in the bodie\r\n    Practisinge grammarie\r\n    One of ye katched shulle be\r\n    By the feyndis subtiltee\r\n    And hys liffe lossit bee\r\n    Broke ys thenne this serye\r\n    Dampned are you thenne eternallie\r\n    Yerth shuldestow thenne never more se\r\n    Scarsly the Goddes mought reskue ye\r\n    Owt of the Helle where you woll lie\r\n    Unto eternytee\r\n    The sterres tealde hit mee.\r\n\r\nGorice the King stood up and went to the south window. The casement\r\nbolts were rusted: he forced them and they flew back with a shriek and\r\na clatter and a thin shower of dust and grit. He opened the window and\r\nlooked out. The heavy night grew to her depth of quiet. There were\r\nlights far out in the marshes, the lights of Lord Juss’s camp-fires of\r\nhis armies gathered against Carcë. Scarcely without a chill might a man\r\nhave looked upon that King standing by the window; for there was in the\r\ntall lean frame of him an iron aspect as of no natural flesh and blood\r\nbut some harder colder element; and his countenance, like the picture\r\nof some dark divinity graven ages ago by men long dead, bore the\r\nimprint of those old qualities of unrelenting power, scorn, violence,\r\nand oppression, ancient as night herself yet untouched by age, young as\r\neach night when it shuts down and old and elemental as the primaeval\r\ndark.\r\n\r\nA long while he stood there, then came again to his book. “Gorice\r\nVII.,” he said in himself. “That was once in the body. And I have done\r\nbetter than that, but not yet well enough. ’Tis too hazardous, the\r\nsecond time, alone. Corund is a man undaunted in war, but the man is\r\ntoo superstitious and quaketh at that which hath not flesh and blood.\r\nApparitions and urchin-shows can quite unman him. There’s Corinius,\r\ncareth not for God or man a point. But he is too rash and unadvised: I\r\nwere mad to trust him in it. Were the Goblin here, it might be carried.\r\nDamnable both-sides villain, he’s cast off from me.” He scanned the\r\npage as if his piercing eyes would thrust beyond the barriers of time\r\nand death and discover some new meaning in the words which should agree\r\nbetter with the thing his mind desired while his judgement forbade it.\r\n“He says ‘damned eternally:’ he says that breaketh the series, and\r\n‘earth shouldst thou then never more see.’ Put him by.”\r\n\r\nAnd the King slowly shut up his book, and locked it with three\r\npadlocks, and put back the key in his bosom. “The need is not yet,” he\r\nsaid. “The sword shall have his day, and Corund. But if that fail me,\r\nthen even this shall not turn me back but I will do that I will do.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIn the same hour when the King was but now entered again into his own\r\nlodgings, came through a runner of Heming’s to let them know that he,\r\nfifteen hundred strong, marched down the Way of Kings from Pixyland.\r\nMoreover they were advertised that the Demon fleet lay in the river\r\nthat night, and it was not unlike the attack should be in the morning\r\nby land and water.\r\n\r\nAll night the King sate in his chamber holding council with his\r\ngenerals and ordering all things for the morrow. All night long he\r\nclosed not his eyes an instant, but the others he made sleep by turns\r\nbecause they should be brisk and ready for the battle. For this was\r\ntheir counsel, to draw out their whole army on the left bank before\r\nthe bridge-gate and there offer battle to the Demons at point of day.\r\nFor if they should abide within doors and suffer the Demons to cut\r\nyoung Heming off from the bridge-gate, then were he lost, and if the\r\nbridge-house should fall and the bridge, then might the Demons lightly\r\nship what force they pleased to the right bank and so closely invest\r\nthem in Carcë. Of an attack on the right bank they had no fear, well\r\nknowing themselves able to sit within doors and laugh at them, since\r\nthe walls were there inexpugnable. But if a battle were now brought\r\nabout before the bridge-gate as they were minded, and Heming should\r\njoin in the fight from the eastward, there was good hope that they\r\nshould be able to crumple up the battle of the Demons, driving them in\r\nupon their centre from the west whilst Heming smote them on the other\r\npart. Whereby these should be cast into a great rout and confusion and\r\nnot be able to escape away to their ships, but there in the fenlands\r\nbefore Carcë should be made a prey unto the Witches.\r\n\r\nWhen it was the cold last hour before the dawn the generals took from\r\nthe King their latest commands ere they drew forth their armies.\r\nCorinius came forth first from the King’s chamber a little while\r\nbefore the rest. In the draughty corridor the lamps swung and smoked,\r\nmaking an uncertain windy light. Corinius espied by the stair-head\r\nthe Lady Sriva standing, whether watching to bid her father adieu or\r\nbut following idle curiosity. Whichever it were, not a fico gave he\r\nfor that, but coming swiftly upon her whisked her aside into an alcove\r\nwhere the light was barely enough to let him see the pale shimmer of\r\nher silken gown, dark hair pinned loosely up in deep snaky coils, and\r\ndark eyes shining. “My witty false one, have I caught thee? Nay, fight\r\nnot. Thy breath smells like cinnamon. Kiss me, Sriva.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll not!” said she, striving to escape. “Naughty man, am I used\r\nthus?” But finding she got nought by struggling, she said in a low\r\nvoice, “Well, if thou bring back Demonland to-night, then, let’s hold\r\nmore chat.”\r\n\r\n“Harken to the naughty traitress,” said he, “that but last night didst\r\ndo me some uncivil discourtesies, and now speaketh me fair: and what\r\na devil for? if not ’cause herseemeth I’ll likely not come back after\r\nthis day’s fight. But I’ll come back, mistress kiss-and-be-gone; ay, by\r\nthe Gods, and I’ll have my payment too.”\r\n\r\nHis lips fed deep on her lips, his strong and greedy hands softly\r\nmastered her against her will, till with a little smothered cry she\r\nembraced him, bruising her tender body against the armour he was girt\r\nwithal. Between the kisses she whispered, “Yes, yes, to-night.” Surely\r\nhe damned spiteful fortune, that sent him not this encounter but an\r\nhalf-hour sooner.\r\n\r\nWhen he was departed, Sriva remained in the shadow of the alcove to\r\nset in order her hair and apparel, not a little disarrayed in that\r\nhot wooing. Out of which darkness she had convenience to observe the\r\nleave-taking of Prezmyra and her lord as they came down that windy\r\ncorridor and paused at the head of the stairs.\r\n\r\nPrezmyra had her arm in his. “I know where the Devil keepeth his tail,\r\nmadam,” said Corund. “And I know a very traitor when I see him.”\r\n\r\n“When didst thou ever yet fare ill by following of my counsel, my\r\nlord?” said Prezmyra. “Or did I refuse thee ever any thing thou didst\r\nrequire me of? These seven years since I put off my maiden zone\r\nfor thee; and twenty kings sought me in sweet marriage, but thee I\r\npreferred before them all, seeing the falcon shall not mate with\r\npopinjays nor the she-eagle with swans and bustards. And will you say\r\nnay to me in this?”\r\n\r\nShe stood round to face him. The pupils of her great eyes were large\r\nin the doubtful lamplight, swallowing their green fires in deep pools\r\nof mystery and darkness. The rich and gorgeous ornaments of her crown\r\nand girdle seemed but a poor casket for that matchless beauty which was\r\nhers: her face, where every noble and sweet quality and every thing\r\ndesirable of earth or heaven had framed each feature to itself: the\r\nglory of her hair, like the red sun’s glory: her whole body’s poise and\r\nposture, like a stately bird’s new-lighted after flight.\r\n\r\n“Though it be very rhubarb to me,” said Corund, “shall I say nay to\r\nthee this tide? Not this tide, my Queen.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks, dear my lord. Disarm him and bring him in if you may. The King\r\nshall not refuse us this to pardon his folly, when thou shalt have\r\nobtained this victory for him upon our enemies.”\r\n\r\nThe Lady Sriva might hear no more, harkened she never so curiously.\r\nBut when they were now come to the stair foot, Corund paused a minute\r\nto try the buckles of his harness. His brow was clouded. At length he\r\nspake, “This shall be a battle mortal fierce and doubtous for both\r\nparties. ’Gainst such mighty opposites as here we have, ’tis possible:\r\nNo more; but kiss me, dear lass. And if: tush, ’t will not be; and yet,\r\nI’d not leave it unsaid: if ill tide ill, I’d not have thee waste all\r\nthy days a-grieving. Thou knowest I am not one of your sour envious\r\njacks, bear so poor a conceit o’ themselves they begrudge their wives\r\nshould wed again lest the next husband should prove the better man.”\r\n\r\nBut Prezmyra came near to him with good and merry countenance: “Let me\r\nstop thy mouth, my lord. These be foolish thoughts for a great king\r\ngoing into battle. Come back in triumph, and i’ the mean season think\r\non me that wait for thee: as a star waits, dear my lord. And never\r\ndoubt the issue.”\r\n\r\n“The issue,” answered he, “I’ll tell thee when ’tis done. I’m no\r\nastronomer. I’ll hew with my sword, love; spoil some of their guesses\r\nif I may.”\r\n\r\n“Good fortune and my love go with thee,” she said.\r\n\r\nSriva coming forth from her hiding hastened to her mother’s lodging,\r\nand there found her that had just bid adieu to her two sons, her face\r\nall blubbered with tears. In the same instant came the Duke her husband\r\nto change his sword, and the Lady Zenambria caught him about the neck\r\nand would have kissed him. But he shook her off, crying out that he\r\nwas weary of her and her slobbering mouth; menacing her besides with\r\nfilthy imprecations, that he would drag her with him and cast her to\r\nthe Demons, who, since they had a strong loathing for such ugly tits\r\nand stale old trots, would no doubt hang her up or disembowel her and\r\nso rid him of his lasting consumption. Therewith he went forth hastily.\r\nBut his wife and daughter, either weeping upon other, came down into\r\nthe court, meaning to go up to the tower above the water-gate to see\r\nthe army marshalled beyond the river. And on the way Sriva related all\r\nshe had heard said betwixt Corund and Prezmyra.\r\n\r\nIn the court they met with Prezmyra’s self, and she going with blithe\r\ncountenance and light tread and humming a merry tune bade them\r\ngood-morrow.\r\n\r\n“You can bear these things more bravelier than we, madam,” said\r\nZenambria. “We be too gentle-hearted methinks and pitiful.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra replied upon her, “’Tis true, madam, I have not the weak sense\r\nof some of you soft-eyed whimpering ladies. And by your leave I’ll keep\r\nmy tears (which be great spoilers of the cheeks beside) until I need\r\n’em.”\r\n\r\nWhen they were passed by, “Is it not a stony-livered and a shameless\r\nhussy, O my mother?” said Sriva. “And is it not scandalous her laughing\r\nand jesting, as I have told it thee, when she did bid him adieu,\r\ndevising only how best she might coax him to save the life of yonder\r\nchambering traitorous hound?”\r\n\r\n“With whom,” said Zenambria, “she wont to do the thing I’d think shame\r\nto speak on. Truly this foreign madam with her loose and wanton ways\r\ndoth scandal the whole land for us.”\r\n\r\nBut Prezmyra went her way, glad that she had not by an eyelid’s flicker\r\nlet her lord guess what a dread possessed her mind, who had in all the\r\nbitter night seen strange and cruel visions portending loss and ruin of\r\nall she held dear.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow, when dawn appeared, was the King’s whole army drawn out in battle\r\narray before the bridge-house. Corinius held command on the left. There\r\nfollowed him fifteen hundred chosen troops of Witchland, with the Dukes\r\nof Trace and Estreganzia, besides these kings and princes with their\r\noutlandish levies: the king of Mynia, Count Escobrine of Tzeusha,\r\nand the Red Foliot. Corsus led the centre, and with him went King Erp\r\nof Ellien and his green-coated sling-casters, the king of Nevria,\r\nAxtacus lord of Permio, the king of Gilta, Olis of Tecapan, and other\r\ncaptains: seventeen hundred men in all. The right the Lord Corund had\r\nchosen for himself. Two thousand Witchland troops, the likeliest and\r\nbest, hardened to war in Impland and Demonland and the south-eastern\r\nborders, followed his standard, beside the heavy spearmen of Baltary\r\nand swordsmen of Buteny and Ar. Viglus his son was there, and the Count\r\nof Thramnë, Cadarus, Didarus of Largos, and the lord of Estremerine.\r\n\r\nBut when the Demons were ware of that great army standing before the\r\nbridge-gate, they put themselves in array for battle. And their ships\r\nmade ready to move up the river under Carcë, if by any means they might\r\nattack the bridge by water and so cut off for the Witches their way of\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nIt was bright low sunshine, and the splendour of the jewelled armour of\r\nthe Demons and their many-coloured kirtles and the plumes that were in\r\ntheir helms was a wonder to behold. This was the order of their battle.\r\nOn their left nearest the river was a great company of horse, and the\r\nLord Brandoch Daha to lead them on a great golden dun with fiery eyes.\r\nHis island men, Melchar and Tharmrod, with Kamerar of Stropardon and\r\nStyrkmir and Stypmar, were the chief captains that rode with him to\r\nthat battle. Next to these came the heavy troops from the east, and the\r\nLord Juss himself their leader on a tall fierce big-boned chestnut.\r\nAbout him was his picked bodyguard of horse, with Bremery of Shaws\r\ntheir captain; and in his battle were these chiefs besides: Astar of\r\nRettray and Gismor Gleam of Justdale and Peridor of Sule. Lord Spitfire\r\nled the centre, and with him Fendor of Shalgreth, and Emeron, and the\r\nmen of Dalney, great spearmen; also the Duke of Azumel, sometime allied\r\nwith Witchland. There went also with him the Lord Gro, that scanned\r\nstill those ancient walls with a heavy heart, thinking on the great\r\nKing within, and with what mastery of intellect and will he ruled those\r\ndark turbulent and bloody men who bare sway under him; thinking on\r\nQueen Prezmyra. To his sick imagining, the blackness of Carcë which no\r\nbright morning light might lighten seemed not as of old the image and\r\nemblem of the royal house of Witchland and their high magnificency and\r\npower on earth, but rather the shadow thrown before of destiny and\r\ndeath ready to put down that power for ever. Which whether it should so\r\nbefall or no he did not greatly care, being aweary of life and life’s\r\nfevers, wild longings, and exorbitant affects, whereof he thought he\r\nhad now learned thus much: that to him, who as it seemed must still\r\nadhere to his own foes abandoning the others’ service, fortune through\r\nwhatever chop could bring no peace at last. On the Demon right the\r\nLord Goldry Bluszco streamed his standard, leading to battle the\r\nsouth-firthers and the heavy spearmen of Mardardale and Throwater. With\r\nhim was King Gaslark and his army of Goblinland, and levies from Ojedia\r\nand Eushtlan, lately revolted from their allegiance to King Gorice.\r\nThe Lord Zigg, with his light horse of Rammerick and Kelialand and the\r\nnorthern dales, covered their flank to the eastward.\r\n\r\nGorice the King beheld these dispositions from his tower above the\r\nwater-gate. He beheld, besides, a thing the Demons might not see from\r\nbelow, for a little swelling of the ground that cut off their view:\r\nthe marching of men far away along the Way of Kings from the eastward:\r\nyoung Heming with the vassalry of Pixyland and Maltraëny. He sent a\r\ntrusty man to apprise Corund of it.\r\n\r\nNow Lord Juss let blow up the battle call, and with the loud braying\r\nof the trumpets the hosts of the Demons swung forth to battle. And\r\nthe clash of those armies when they met before Carcë was like the\r\nbursting of a thundercloud. But like a great sea-cliff patient for\r\nages under the storm-winds’ furies, that not one night’s loud wind and\r\ncharging breakers can wear away, nor yet a thousand thousand nights,\r\nthe embattled strength of Witchland met their onset, mixed with them,\r\nflung them back, and stood unremoved. Corund’s iron battalions bare in\r\nthis first brunt the heaviest load, and bare it through. For the ships,\r\nwith young Hesper Golthring in command most fiercely urging them, ran\r\nup the river to force the bridge, and Corund whiles he met on his front\r\nthe onset of the flower of Demonland must still be shot at by these\r\nbehind. Hacmon and Viglus, those young princes his sons, were charged\r\nwith the warding of the bridge and walls to burn and break up their\r\nships. And they of all hands bestirring them twice and thrice threw\r\nback the Demons when they had gotten a footing on the bridge; until in\r\nfine, both sides for a long space fighting very cruelly, it fell out\r\nvery fatally against Hesper and his power, his ships all lighted in a\r\nlowe and the more part of his folk burned or drowned or slain with the\r\nsword; and himself after many and grievous wounds in his last attempt\r\nleft alone on the bridge, and crawling to have got away was stabbed in\r\nwith a dagger and died.\r\n\r\nAfter this the ships fell back down the river, so many as might avail\r\nthereto, and those sons of Corund, their task manfully fulfilled, came\r\nforth with their folk to join in the main battle. And the smoke of the\r\nburning ships was like incense in the nostrils of the King watching\r\nthese things from his tower above the water-gate.\r\n\r\nLittle pause was there betwixt this first brunt and the next, for\r\nHeming now bare down from the east, drave in Zigg’s horsemen that were\r\nhampered in the heavy ground, and pressed his onset home on the Demon\r\nright. Along the whole line from Corund’s post beside the river to the\r\neastern flank where Heming joined Corinius the Witches now set on most\r\nfiercely; and now were the odds of numbers, which were at first against\r\nthem, swung mightily in their favour, and under this great side-blow\r\non his flank not all the Lord Goldry Bluszco’s soldiership nor all\r\nthe terror of his might in arms could uphold the Demons’ battle-line.\r\nYard by yard they fell back before the Witches, most gloriously\r\nmaintaining their array unbroken, though the outland allies broke and\r\nfled. Meantime on the Demon left Juss and Brandoch Daha most stubbornly\r\nwithstood that onslaught, albeit they had to do with the first and\r\nchosen troops of Witchland. In which struggle befell the most bloody\r\nfighting that was yet seen that day, and the stour of battle so asper\r\nand so mortal that it was hard to see how any man should come out from\r\nit with life, since not a man of either side would budge an inch but\r\ndie there in his steps if he might not rather slay the foe before him.\r\nSo the armies swayed for an hour like wrastlers locked, but in the end\r\nthe Lord Corund had his way and held his ground before the bridge-gate.\r\n\r\nRomenard of Dalney, galloping to Lord Juss where he paused a while\r\npanting from the violence of the battle, brought him by Spitfire’s\r\ncommand tidings from the right: telling him Goldry’s self could hold\r\nno longer against such odds: that the centre yet held, but at the next\r\nonset was like to break, or the right wing else be driven in upon\r\ntheir rear and all overwhelmed: “If your highness cannot throw back\r\nCorund, all is lost.”\r\n\r\nIn these short minutes’ lull (if lull it were when all the time the\r\nbattle like a sounding sea rolled on with a ceaseless noise of riding\r\nand slaying and the clang of arms), Juss chose. Demonland and the whole\r\nworld’s destinies hung on his choice. He had no counsellor. He had no\r\ntime for slow deliberation. In such a moment imagination, resolution,\r\nswift decision, all high gifts of nature, are nought: swift horses\r\ngulfed and lost in the pit which fate the enemy digged in the way\r\nbefore them; except painful knowledge, stored up patiently through\r\nyears of practice, shall have prepared a road sure and clean for their\r\nflying hooves to bear them in the great hour of destiny. So it was from\r\nthe beginning with all great captains: so with the Lord Juss in that\r\nhour when ruin swooped upon his armies. For two minutes’ space he stood\r\nsilent; then sent Bremery of Shaws galloping westward like one minded\r\nto break his neck with his orders to Lord Brandoch Daha, and Romenard\r\neastward again to Spitfire. And Juss himself riding forward among\r\nhis soldiers shouted among them in a voice that was like a trumpet\r\nthundering, that they should now make ready for the fiercest trial of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n“Is my cousin mad?” said Lord Brandoch Daha, when he saw and understood\r\nthe whole substance and matter of it. “Or hath he found Corund so\r\ntame to deal with he can make shift without me and well nigh half his\r\nstrength, and yet withstand him?”\r\n\r\n“He looseth this hold,” answered Bremery, “to snatch at safety. ’Tis\r\ndesperate, but all other ways we but wait on destruction. Our right is\r\nclean driven in, the left holdeth but hardly. He chargeth your highness\r\nbreak their centre if you may. They have somewhat dangerously advanced\r\ntheir left, and therein is their momentary peril if we be swift enough.\r\nBut remember that here, o’ this side, is their greatest power before\r\nus, and if we be ’whelmed ere you can compass it——”\r\n\r\n“No more but Yes,” said Lord Brandoch Daha. “Time gallopeth: so must\r\nwe.”\r\n\r\nEven so in that hour when Goldry and Zigg, giving way step by step\r\nbefore superior odds, were bent back well nigh with their backs to the\r\nriver, and Corund on the Demons’ left had after a bitter battle checked\r\nand held them and threatened now to complete in one more great blow\r\nthe ruin of them all, Juss, choosing a desperate expedient to meet a\r\ndanger that else must destroy him, weakened his hard-pressed left to\r\nthrow Brandoch Daha and well nigh eight hundred horse into Spitfire’s\r\nbattle to drive a wedge betwixt Corsus and Corinius.\r\n\r\nIt was now long past noon. The tempest of battle that had quietened\r\nawhile for utter weariness roared forth anew from wing to wing as\r\nBrandoch Daha hurled his horsemen upon Corsus and the subject allies,\r\nwhile all along the battle-line the Demons rallied to fling back the\r\nenemy. For a breathless while, the issue hung in suspense: then the men\r\nof Gilta and Nevria broke and fled, Brandoch Daha and his cavalry swept\r\nthrough the gap, wheeled right and left and took Corsus and Corinius in\r\nflank and rear.\r\n\r\nThere fell in this onset Axtacus lord of Permio, the kings of Ellien\r\nand Gilta, Gorius the son of Corsus, the Count of Tzeusha, and many\r\nother noblemen and men of mark. Of the Demons many were hurt and many\r\nslain, but none of great note save Kamerar of Stropardon, whose head\r\nCorinius swapt off clean with a blow of his battle-axe, and Trentmar\r\nwhom Corsus smote full in the stomach with a javelin so that he fell\r\ndown from his horse and was dead at once. Now was all the left and\r\ncentre of the Witches’ battle thrown into great confusion, and the\r\nallies most of all fallen into disorder and fain to yield themselves\r\nand pray for mercy. The King, seeing the extent of this disaster, sent\r\na galloper to Corund, who straightway sent to Corsus and Corinius\r\ncommanding them get them at their speediest with all their folk back\r\ninto Carcë while time yet served. Himself in the meantime, showing\r\nnow, like the sun, his greatest countenance in his lowest estate, set\r\non with his weary army to stem the advance of Juss, who now momently\r\ngathered fresh force against him, and to keep open for the rest of the\r\nKing’s forces their way by the bridge-gate into Carcë. Corinius, when\r\nhe understood it, galloped thither with a band of men to aid Corund,\r\nand this did likewise Heming and Dekalajus and other captains of the\r\nWitches. But Corsus himself, counting the day lost and considering that\r\nhe was an old man and had fought now long enough, gat him privily back\r\ninto Carcë as quickly as he was able. And truly he was bleeding from\r\nmany wounds.\r\n\r\nBy this great stand of Corund and his men was time won for a great part\r\nof the residue of the army to escape into Carcë. And ever the Witches\r\nwere put aback and lost much ground, yet ever the Lord Corund by his\r\ngreat valiance and noble heart recomforted his folk, so that they gave\r\nback very slowly, most bloodily disputing the ground foot by foot to\r\nthe bridge-gate, that they also might win in again, so many as might.\r\nJuss said, “This is the greatest deed of arms that ever I in the days\r\nof my life did see, and I have so great an admiration and wonder in my\r\nheart for Corund that almost I would give him peace. But I have sworn\r\nnow to have no peace with Witchland.”\r\n\r\nLord Gro was in that battle with the Demons. He ran Didarus through the\r\nneck with his sword, so that he fell down and was dead.\r\n\r\nCorund, when he saw it, heaved up his axe, but changed his intention in\r\nthe manage, saying, “O landskip of iniquity, shalt thou kill beside me\r\nthe men of mine household? But my friendship sitteth not on a weather\r\nvane. Live, and be a traitor.”\r\n\r\nBut Gro, being mightily moved with these words, and staring at great\r\nCorund wide-eyed like a man roused from a dream, answered, “Have I done\r\namiss? ’Tis easy remedied.” Therewith he turned about and slew a man of\r\nDemonland. Which Spitfire seeing, he cried out upon Gro in a great rage\r\nfor a most filthy traitor, and bloodily rushing in thrust him through\r\nthe buckler into the brain.\r\n\r\nIn such wise and by such a sudden vengeance did the Lord Gro most\r\nmiserably end his life-days. Who, being a philosopher and a man of\r\npeace, careless of particular things of earth, had followed and\r\nobserved all his days steadfastly one heavenly star; yet now in the\r\nbloody battle before Carcë died in the common opinion of men a manifold\r\nperjured traitor, that had at length gotten the guerdon of his guile.\r\n\r\nNow came the Lord Juss with a great rout of men armed on his great\r\nhorse with his sword dripping with blood, and the battle sprang up into\r\nyet more noise and fury, and great manslaying befell, and many able men\r\nof Witchland fell in that stour and the Demons had almost put them from\r\nthe bridge-gate. But the Lord Corund, rallying his folk, swung back\r\nyet again the battle-tide, albeit he was by a great odds outnumbered.\r\nAnd he sought none but Juss himself in that deadly mellay; who when he\r\nsaw him coming he refused him not but made against him most fiercely,\r\nand with great clanging blows they swapped together awhile, until\r\nCorund hewed Juss’s shield asunder and struck him from his horse. Juss,\r\nleaping up again, thrust up at Corund with his sword and with the\r\nviolence of the blow brake through the rings of his byrny about his\r\nmiddle and drave the sword into his breast. And Corund felled him to\r\nearth with a great down-stroke on the helm, so that he lay senseless.\r\n\r\nStill the battle raged before the bridge-gate, and great wounds were\r\ngiven and taken of either side. But now the sons of Corund saw that\r\ntheir father had lost much of his blood and waxed feeble, and the\r\nresidue of his folk seeing it too, and seeing themselves so few against\r\nso many, began to be abashed. So those sons of Corund, riding up to him\r\non either side with a band of men, made him turn back with them and go\r\nwith them in by the gate to Carcë, the which he did like a man amazed\r\nand knowing not what he doeth. And indeed it was a great marvel how so\r\ngreat a lord, wounded to the death, might sit on horseback.\r\n\r\nIn the great court he was gotten down from his horse. The Lady\r\nPrezmyra, when she perceived that his harness was all red with blood,\r\nand saw his wound, fell not down in a swoon as another might, but took\r\nhis arm about her shoulder and so supported, with her step-sons to help\r\nher, that great frame which could no more support itself yet had till\r\nthat hour borne up against the whole world’s strength in arms. Leeches\r\ncame that she had called for, and a litter, and they brought him to\r\nthe banquet hall. But after no long while those learned men confessed\r\nhis hurt was deadly, and all their cunning nought. Whereupon, much\r\ndisdaining to die in bed, not in the field fighting with his enemies,\r\nthe Lord Corund caused himself, completely armed and weaponed, with the\r\nstains and dust of the battle yet upon him, to be set in his chair,\r\nthere to await death.\r\n\r\nHeming, when this was done, came to tell it to the King, where from\r\nthe tower above the water-gate he beheld the end of this battle. The\r\nDemons held the bridge-house. The fight was done. The King sat in his\r\nchair looking down to the battle-field. His dark mantle was about his\r\nshoulders. He leaned forward resting his chin in his hand. They of his\r\nbodyguard, nine or ten, stood huddled together some yards away as if\r\nafraid to approach him. As Heming came near, the King turned his head\r\nslowly to look at him. The low sun, swinging blood-red over Tenemos,\r\nshone full on the King’s face. And as Heming looked in the face of the\r\nKing fear gat hold upon him, so that he durst not speak a word to the\r\nKing, but made obeisance and departed again, trembling like one who has\r\nseen a sight beyond the veil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          XXXII: THE LATTER END OF ALL THE LORDS OF WITCHLAND\r\n\r\n  OF THE COUNCIL OF WAR; AND HOW THE LORD CORSUS, BEING REJECTED OF\r\n      THE KING, TURNED HIS THOUGHTS TO OTHER THINGS; AND OF THE LAST\r\n      CONJURING THAT WAS IN CARCË AND THE LAST WINE-BIBBING; AND\r\n      HOW YET ONCE AGAIN THE LADY PREZMYRA SPAKE WITH THE LORDS OF\r\n      DEMONLAND IN CARCË.\r\n\r\n\r\nGorice the King held in his private chamber a council of war on the\r\nmorrow of the battle before Carcë. The morning was over-cast with\r\nsullen cloud, and though all the windows were thrown wide the sluggish\r\nair hung heavy in the room, as if it too were pervaded by the cold\r\ndark humour that clogged the vitals of those lords of Witchland like a\r\ndrowsy drug, or as if the stars would breathe themselves for a greater\r\nmischief. Pale and drawn were those lords’ faces; and, for all they\r\nstrove to put on a brave countenance before the King, clean gone was\r\nthe vigour and war-like mien that clothed them but yesterday. Only\r\nCorinius kept some spring of his old valiancy and portly bearing,\r\nseated with arms akimbo over against the King, his heavy under-jaw set\r\nforward and his nostrils wide. He had slept ill or watched late, for\r\nhis eyes were blood-shotten, and the breath of his nostrils was heavy\r\nwith wine.\r\n\r\n“We tarry for Corsus,” said the King. “Had he not word of my bidding?”\r\n\r\nDekalajus said, “Lord, I will summon him again. These misfortunes I\r\nfear me hang heavy on his mind, and, by your majesty’s leave, he is\r\nscarce his own man since yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Do it straight,” said the King. “Give me thy papers, Corinius. Thou\r\nart my general since Corund gat his death. I will see what yesterday\r\nhath cost us and what power yet remaineth to crush me these snakes by\r\nforce of arms.”\r\n\r\n“These be the numbers, O King,” said Corinius. “But three thousand\r\nand five hundred fighting men, and well nigh half of these over much\r\ncrippled with wounds to do aught save behind closed walls. It were but\r\nto give the Demons easy victory to adventure against them, that stand\r\nbefore Carcë four thousand sound men in arms.”\r\n\r\nThe King blew scornfully through his nostrils. “Who told thee their\r\nstrength?” said he.\r\n\r\n“It were dangerous to write them down a man fewer,” answered Corinius.\r\nAnd Hacmon said, “My Lord the King, I would adventure my head they have\r\nmore. And your majesty will not forget they be all flown with eagerness\r\nand pride after yesterday’s field, whereas our men——”\r\n\r\n“Were ye sons of Corund,” said the King, breaking in quietly on his\r\nspeech and looking dangerously upon him, “but twigs of your father’s\r\ntree, that he being cut down ye have no manhood left nor vital sap,\r\nbut straight wither in idiotish dotage? I will not have these womanish\r\ncounsels spoke in Carcë; no, nor thought in Carcë.”\r\n\r\nCorinius said, “We had sure intelligence, O King, whenas they landed\r\nthat their main army was six thousand fighting men; and last night\r\nmyself spake with full a score of our officers, and had a true tale\r\nof some few of the Demons captured by us before they were slain with\r\nthe sword. When I say to you Juss standeth before Carcë four thousand\r\nstrong, I swell not the truth. His losses yesterday were but a\r\nflea-biting ’gainst ours.”\r\n\r\nThe King nodded a curt assent.\r\n\r\nCorinius proceeded, “If we might contrive indeed to raise help from\r\nwithout Carcë, were it but five hundred spears to distract his mind\r\nsome part from usward, nought but your majesty’s strict command should\r\nstay me but I should assault him. It were perilous even so, but never\r\nhave you known me leave a fruit unplucked at for fear of thorns. But\r\nuntil that time, nought but your straight command might win me to essay\r\na sally. Since well I wot it were my death, and the ruin of you, O\r\nKing, and of all Witchland.”\r\n\r\nThe King listened with unmoved countenance, his shaven lip set somewhat\r\nin a sneer, his eyes half closed like the eyes of a cat couched\r\nsphinx-like in the sun. But no sun shone in that council chamber. The\r\nleaden pall hung darker without, even as morning grew toward noon. “My\r\nLord the King,” said Heming, “send me. To overslip their guards i’ the\r\nnight, ’tis not a thing beyond invention. That done, I’d gather you\r\nsome small head of men, enough to serve this turn, if I must rake the\r\nseven kingdoms to find ’em.”\r\n\r\nWhile Heming spoke, the door opened and the Duke Corsus entered the\r\nchamber. An ill sight was he, flabbier of cheek and duller of eye\r\nthan was his wont. His face was bloodless, his great paunch seemed\r\nshrunken, and his shoulders yet more hunched since yesterday. His gait\r\nwas uncertain, and his hand shook as he moved the chair from the board\r\nand took his seat before the King. The King looked on him awhile in\r\nsilence, and under that gaze beads of sweat stood on Corsus’s brow and\r\nhis under-lip twitched.\r\n\r\n“We need thy counsel, O Corsus,” said the King. “Thus it is: since our\r\nill-faced stars gave victory to the Demon rebels in yesterday’s battle,\r\nJuss and his brethren front us with four thousand men, whiles I have\r\nnot two thousand soldiers unhurt in Carcë. Corinius accounteth us too\r\nweak to risk a sally but and if we might contrive some diversion from\r\nwithout. And that (after yesterday) is not to be thought on. Hither\r\nand to Melikaphkhaz did we draw all our powers, and the subject allies\r\nnot for our love but for fear sake and for lust of gain flocked to our\r\nstandard. These caterpillars drop off now. Yet if we fight not, then\r\nis our strength in arms clean spent, and our enemies need but to sit\r\nbefore Carcë till we be starved. ’Tis a point of great difficulty and\r\nknotty to solve.”\r\n\r\n“Difficult indeed, O my Lord the King,” said Corsus. His glance shifted\r\nround the board, avoiding the steady gaze bent on him from beneath\r\nthe eaves of King Gorice’s brow, and resting at last on the jewelled\r\nsplendour of the crown of Witchland on the King’s head. “O King,” he\r\nsaid, “you demand my rede, and I shall not say nor counsel you nothing\r\nbut that good and well shall come thereof, as much as yet may be in\r\nthis pass we stand in. For now is our greatness turned in woe, dolour,\r\nand heaviness. And easy it is to be after-witted.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and his under-jaw wobbled and twitched. “Speak on,” said the\r\nKing. “Thou stutterest forth nothings by fits and girds, as an ague\r\ntaketh a goose. Let me know thy rede.”\r\n\r\nCorsus said, “You will not take it, I know, O King. For we of Witchland\r\nhave ever been ruled by the rock rather than by the rudder. I had\r\nliever be silent. Silence was never written down.”\r\n\r\n“Thou wouldst, and thou wouldst not!” said the King. “Whence gottest\r\nthou this look of a dish of whey with blood spit in it? Speak, or\r\nthou’lt anger me.”\r\n\r\n“Then blame me not, O King,” said Corsus. “Thus it seemeth to me, that\r\nthe hour hath struck whenas we of Witchland must needs look calamity\r\nin the eye and acknowledge we have thrown our last, and lost all.\r\nThe Demons, as we have seen to our undoing, be unconquerable in war.\r\nYet are their minds pranked with many silly phantasies of honour and\r\ncourtesy which may preserve us the poor dregs yet unspilt from the cup\r\nof our fortune, if we but leave unseasonable pride and see where our\r\nadvantage lieth.”\r\n\r\n“Chat, chat, chat!” said the King. “Perdition catch me if I can find a\r\nmeaning in it! What dost thou bid me do?”\r\n\r\nCorsus met the King’s eye at last. He braced himself as if to meet\r\na blow. “Throw not your cloak in the fire because your house is\r\nburning, O King. Surrender all to Juss at his discretion. And trust\r\nme the foolish softness of these Demons will leave us freedom and the\r\nwherewithal to live at ease.”\r\n\r\nThe King was leaned a little forward as Corsus, somewhat dry-throated\r\nbut gathering heart as he spake, blurted forth his counsel of defeat.\r\nNo man among them looked on Corsus, but all on the King, and for\r\na minute’s space was no sound save the sound of breathing in that\r\nchamber. Then a puff of hot air blew a window to with a thud, and the\r\nKing without moving his head rolled his awful glance forth and back\r\nover his council slowly, fixing each in his turn. And the King said,\r\n“Unto which of you is this counsel acceptable? Let him speak and\r\ninstruct us.”\r\n\r\nAll did sit mum like beasts. The King spake again, saying, “It is\r\nwell. Were there of my council such another vermin, so sottish,\r\nso louse-hearted, as this one hath proclaimed himself, I had been\r\npersuaded Witchland was a sleepy pear, corrupted in her inward parts.\r\nAnd that were so, I had given order straightway for the sally; and,\r\nfor his chastening and your dishonour, this Corsus should have led you.\r\nAnd so an end, ere the imposthume of our shame brake forth too foul\r\nbefore earth and heaven.”\r\n\r\n“I admire not, Lord, that you do strike at me,” said Corsus. “Yet I\r\npray you think how many Kings in Carcë have heaped with injurious\r\nindignities them that were so hardy as give them wholesome counsel\r\nafore their fall. Though your majesty were a half-god or a Fury out of\r\nthe pit, you could not by further resisting deliver us out of this net\r\nwherein the Demons have gotten us caught and tied. You can keep geese\r\nno longer, O King. Will you rend me because I bid you be content to\r\nkeep goslings?”\r\n\r\nCorinius smote the table with his fist. “O monstrous vermin!” he cried,\r\n“because thou wast scalded, must all we be afeared of cold water?”\r\n\r\nBut the King stood up in his majesty, and Corsus shrank beneath the\r\nflame of his royal anger. And the King spake and said, “The council\r\nis up, my lords. For thee, Corsus, I dismiss thee from my council.\r\nThou art to thank my clemency that I take not thy head for this. It\r\nwere for thy better safety, which well I know thou prizest dearer than\r\nmine honour, that thou show not in my path till these perilous days be\r\noverpast.” And unto Corinius he said, “On thy head it lieth that the\r\nDemons storm not the hold, as haply their hot pride may incense them\r\nto attempt. Expect me not at supper. I lie in the Iron Tower to-night,\r\nand let none disturb me there at peril of his head. You of my council\r\nmust attend me here four hours ere to-morrow’s noon. Look to it well,\r\nCorinius, that nought shalt thou do nor in any wise adventure our\r\nforces against the Demons till thou receive my further bidding, save\r\nonly to hold Carcë against any assault if need be. For this thy life\r\nshall answer. For the Demons, they were wisest praise a fair day at\r\nnight. If mine enemy uproot a boulder above my dwelling, so I be mighty\r\nenow of mine hands I may, even in the nick of time that it tottereth to\r\nleap and crush mine house, o’erset it on him and pash him to a mummy.”\r\n\r\nSo speaking, the King moved resolute with a great strong step toward\r\nthe door. There paused he, his hand upon the silver latch, and looking\r\ntigerishly on Corsus, “Be advised,” he said, “thou. Cross not my path\r\nagain. Nor, while I think on’t, send me not thy daughter again, as\r\nlast year thou didst. Apt to the sport she is, and well enow she served\r\nmy turn aforetime. But the King of Witchland suppeth not twice of the\r\nsame dish, nor lacketh he fresh wenches if he need them.”\r\n\r\nWhereat all they laughed. But Corsus’s face grew red as blood.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nOn such wise brake up the council. Corinius with the sons of Corund and\r\nof Corsus went upon the walls ordering all in obedience to the word of\r\nGorice the King. But that old Duke Corsus betook him to his chamber\r\nin the north gallery. Nor might he abide even a small while at ease,\r\nbut sate now in his carven chair, now on the window-sill, now on his\r\nbroad-canopied bed, and now walked the chamber floor twisting his hands\r\nand gnawing his lip. And if he were distraught in mind, small wonder it\r\nwere, set as he was betwixt hawk and buzzard, the King’s wrath menacing\r\nhim in Carcë and the hosts of Demonland without.\r\n\r\nSo wore the day till supper-time. And at supper was Corsus, to their\r\nmuch amaze, sitting in his place, and the ladies Zenambria and Sriva\r\nwith him. He drank deep, and when supper was done he filled a goblet\r\nsaying, “My lord the king of Demonland and ye other Witches, good it\r\nis that we, who stand as now we stand with one foot in the jaws of\r\ndestruction, should bear with one another. Neither should any hide his\r\nthought from other, but say openly, even as I this morning before the\r\nface of our Lord the King, his thought and counsel. Wherefore without\r\nshame do I confess me ill-advised to-day, when I urged the King to\r\nmake peace with Demonland. I wax old, and old men will oft embrace\r\ntimorous counsels which, if there be wisdom and valiancy left in them,\r\nthey soon renounce when the stress is overpast and they have leisure\r\nto afterthink them with a sad mind. And clear as day it is that the\r\nKing was right, both in his chastening of my faint courage and in his\r\nbidding thee, O King Corinius, stand to thy watch and do nought till\r\nthis night be worn. For went he not to the Iron Tower? And to what\r\nend else spendeth he the night in yonder chamber of dread than to do\r\nsorcery or his magic art, as aforetime he did, and in such wise blast\r\nthese Demons to perdition even in the spring-tide of their fortunes?\r\nAt no point of time hath Witchland greater need of our wishes than at\r\nthis coming midnight, and I pray you, my lords, let us meet a little\r\nbefore in this hall that we with one heart and mind may drink fair\r\nfortune to the King’s enchantery.”\r\n\r\nWith such pleasant words and sympathetical insinuations, working at\r\na season when the wine-cup had caused unfold some gayness in their\r\nhearts that were fordone with the hard scapes and chances of disastrous\r\nwar, was Corsus grown to friendship again with the lords of Witchland.\r\nSo, when the guard was set and all made sure for the night, they came\r\ntogether in the great banquet hall, whereas more than three years\r\nago the Prince La Fireez had feasted and after fought against them\r\nof Witchland. But now was he drowned among the shifting tides in the\r\nStraits of Melikaphkhaz. And the Lord Corund, that fought that night\r\nin such valiant wise, now in that same hall, armed from throat to foot\r\nas becometh a great soldier dead, lay in state, crowned on his brow\r\nwith the amethystine crown of Impland. The spacious side-benches were\r\nuntenanted and void their high seats, and the cross-bench was removed\r\nto make place for Corund’s bier. The lords of Witchland sate at a\r\nsmall table below the dais: Corinius in the seat of honour at the end\r\nnearest the door, and over against him Corsus, and on Corinius’s left\r\nZenambria, and on his right Dekalajus son to Corsus, and then Heming;\r\nand on Corsus’s left his daughter Sriva, and those two remaining of\r\nCorund’s sons on his right. All were there save Prezmyra, and her had\r\nnone seen since her lord’s death, but she kept her chamber. Flamboys\r\nstood in the silver stands as of old, lighting the lonely spaces of the\r\nhall, and four candles shivered round the bier where Corund slept. Fair\r\ngoblets stood on the board brimmed with dark sweet Thramnian wine, one\r\nfor each feaster there, and cold bacon pies and botargoes and craw-fish\r\nin hippocras sauce furnished a light midnight meal.\r\n\r\nNow scarce were they set, when the flamboys burned pale in a strange\r\nlight from without doors: an evil, pallid, bale-like lowe, such as\r\nGro had beheld in days gone by when King Gorice XII. first conjured\r\nin Carcë. Corinius paused ere taking his seat. Goodly and stalwart he\r\nshowed in his blue silk cloak and silvered byrny. The fair crown of\r\nDemonland, wherewith Corsus had been enforced to crown him on that\r\ngreat night in Owlswick, shone above his light brown curling hair.\r\nYouth and lustihood stood forth in every line of his great frame, and\r\non his bare arms smooth and brawny, with their wristlets of gold;\r\nbut somewhat ghastly was the corpse-like pallor of that light on his\r\nshaven jowl, and his thick scornful lips were blackened, like those of\r\npoisoned men, in that light of bale.\r\n\r\n“Saw ye not this light aforetime?” he cried, “and ’twas the shadow\r\nbefore the sun of our omnipotence. Fate’s hammer is lifted up to\r\nstrike. Drink with me to our Lord the King that laboureth with destiny.”\r\n\r\nAll drank deep, and Corinius said, “Pass we on the cups that each may\r\ndrain his neighbour’s. ’Tis an old lucky custom Corund taught me out of\r\nImpland. Swift, for the fate of Witchland is poised in the balance.”\r\nTherewith he passed his cup to Zenambria, who quaffed it to the dregs.\r\nAnd all they, passing on their cups, drank deep again; all save Corsus\r\nalone. But Corsus’s eyes were big with terror as he looked on the cup\r\npassed on to him by Corund’s son.\r\n\r\n“Drink, O Corsus,” said Corinius; and seeing him still waver, “what\r\nails the old doting disard?” he cried. “He stareth on good wine with an\r\neye as ghastly as a mad dog’s beholding water.”\r\n\r\nIn that instant the unearthly glare went out as a lamp in a gust of\r\nwind, and only the flamboys and the funeral candles flickered on the\r\nfeasters with uncertain radiance. Corinius said again, “Drink.”\r\n\r\nBut Corsus set down the cup untasted, and stayed irresolute. Corinius\r\nopened his mouth to speak, and his jaw fell, as of a man that\r\nconceiveth suddenly some dread suspicion. But ere he might speak word,\r\na blinding flash went from earth to heaven, and the firm floor of the\r\nbanquet hall rocked and shook as with an earthquake. All save Corinius\r\nfell back into their seats, clutching the table, amazed and dumb. Crash\r\nafter crash, after the listening ear was well nigh split by the roar,\r\nthe horror broken out of the bowels of night thundered and ravened in\r\nCarcë. Laughter, as of damned souls banqueting in Hell, rode on the\r\ntortured air. Wildfire tore the darkness asunder, half blinding them\r\nthat sat about that table, and Corinius gripped the board with either\r\nhand as a last deafening crash shook the walls, and a flame rushed\r\nup the night, lighting the whole sky with a livid glare. And in that\r\ntrisulk flash Corinius beheld through the south-west window the Iron\r\nTower blasted and cleft asunder, and the next instant fallen in an\r\navalanche of red-hot ruin.\r\n\r\n“The keep hath fallen!” he cried. And, deadly wearied on a sudden, he\r\nsank heavily into his seat. The cataclysm was passed by like a wind in\r\nthe night; but now was heard a sound as of the enemy rushing to the\r\nassault. Corinius strove to rise, but his legs were over feeble. His\r\neye lit on Corsus’s untasted cup, that which was passed on to him by\r\nViglus Corund’s son, and he cried, “What devil’s work is this? I have a\r\nstrange numbness in my bones. By heavens, thou shalt drink that cup or\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\nViglus, his eyes protruding, his hand clutching at his breast,\r\nstruggled to rise but could not.\r\n\r\nHeming half staggered up, fumbling for his sword, then pitched forward\r\non the table with a horrid rattle of the throat.\r\n\r\nBut Corsus leaped up trembling, his dull eyes aflame with triumphant\r\nmalice. “The King hath thrown and lost,” he cried, “as well I foresaw\r\nit. And now have the children of night taken him to themselves. And\r\nthou, damned Corinius, and you sons of Corund, are but dead swine\r\nbefore me. Ye have all drunk venom, and ye are dead. Now will I deliver\r\nup Carcë to the Demons. And it, and your bodies, with mine electuary\r\nrotting in your vitals, shall buy me peace from Demonland.”\r\n\r\n“O horrible! Then I too am poisoned,” cried the Lady Zenambria, and\r\nshe fell a-swooning.\r\n\r\n“’Tis pity,” said Corsus. “Blame the passing of the cups for that. I\r\nmight not speak ere the poison had chained me the limbs of these cursed\r\ndevils, and made ’em harmless.”\r\n\r\nCorinius’s jaw set like a bulldog’s. Painfully gritting his teeth he\r\nrose from his seat, his sword naked in his hand. Corsus, that was now\r\npassing near him on his way to the door, saw too late that he had\r\nreckoned without his host. Corinius, albeit the baneful drug bound his\r\nlegs as with a cere-cloth, was yet too swift for Corsus, who, fleeing\r\nbefore him to the door, had but time to clutch the heavy curtains ere\r\nthe sword of Corinius took him in the back. He fell, and lay a-writhing\r\nlumpishly, like a toad spitted on a skewer. And the floor of steatite\r\nwas made slippery with his blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAST CONJURING IN CARCË.]\r\n\r\n“’Tis well. Through the guts,” said Corinius. No might he had to draw\r\nforth the sword, but staggered as one drunken, and fell to earth,\r\npropped against the jambs of the lofty doorway.\r\n\r\nSome while he lay there, harkening to the sounds of battle without;\r\nfor the Iron Tower was fallen athwart the outer wall, making a breach\r\nthrough all lines of defence. And through that breach the Demons\r\nstormed the hold of Carcë, that never unfriendly foot had entered by\r\nforce in all the centuries since it was builded by Gorice I. An ill\r\nwatch it was for Corinius to lie harkening to that unequal fight,\r\nunable to stir a hand, and all they that should have headed the defence\r\ndead or dying before his eyes. Yet was his breath lightened and his\r\npain some part eased when his eye rested on the gross body of Corsus\r\ntwisting in the agony of death upon his sword.\r\n\r\nIn such wise passed well nigh an hour. The bodily strength of Corinius\r\nand his iron heart bare up against the power of the venom long after\r\nthose others had breathed out their souls in death. But now was the\r\nbattle done and the victory with them of Demonland, and the lords Juss\r\nand Goldry Bluszco and Brandoch Daha with certain of their fighting men\r\ncame into the banquet hall. Smeared they were with blood and the dust\r\nof battle, for not without great blows and the death of many a stout\r\nlad had the hold been won. Goldry said as they paused at the threshold,\r\n“This is the very banquet house of death. How came these by their end?”\r\n\r\nCorinius’s brow darkened at the sight of the lords of Demonland, and\r\nmightily he strove to raise himself, but sank back groaning. “I have\r\ngotten an everlasting chill o’ the bones,” he said. “Yon hellish\r\ntraitor murthered us all by poison; else should some of you have gotten\r\nyour deaths by me or ever ye won up into Carcë.”\r\n\r\n“Bring him some water,” said Juss. And he with Brandoch Daha gently\r\nlifted Corinius and bare him to his chair where he should be more at\r\nease.\r\n\r\nGoldry said, “Here is a lady liveth.” For Sriva, that sitting on her\r\nfather’s left hand had so escaped a poisoned draught at the passing of\r\nthe cups, rose from the table where she had cowered in fearful silence,\r\nand cast herself in a flood of tears and terrified supplications about\r\nGoldry’s knees. Goldry bade guard her to the camp and there bestow her\r\nin safe asylum until the morning.\r\n\r\nNow was Corinius near his end, but he gathered strength to speak,\r\nsaying, “I do joy that not by your sword were we put down, but by the\r\nunequal trumpery of Fortune, whose tool was this Corsus and the King’s\r\ndevilish pride, that desired to harness Heaven and Hell to his chariot.\r\nFortune’s a right strumpet, to fondle me in the neck and now yerk me\r\none thus i’ the midriff.”\r\n\r\n“Not Fortune, my Lord Corinius, but the Gods,” said Goldry, “whose feet\r\nbe shod with wool.”\r\n\r\nBy then was water brought in, and Brandoch Daha would have given him\r\nto drink. But Corinius would have none of it, but jerked his head\r\naside and o’erset the cup, and looking fiercely on Lord Brandoch Daha,\r\n“Vile fellow,” he said, “so thou too art come to insult on Witchland’s\r\ngrave? Thou’dst strike me now into the centre, and thou wert not more a\r\ndancing madam than a soldier.”\r\n\r\n“How?” said Brandoch Daha. “Say a dog bite me in the ham: must I bite\r\nhim again i’ the same part?”\r\n\r\nCorinius’s eyelids closed, and he said weakly, “How look thy womanish\r\ngew-gaws in Krothering since I towsed ’em?” And therewith the creeping\r\npoison reached his strong heartstrings, and he died.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow was silence for a space in that banquet hall, and in the silence\r\na step was heard, and the lords of Demonland turned toward the lofty\r\ndoorway, that yawned as an arched cavern-mouth of darkness; for Corsus\r\nhad torn down the arras curtains in his death-throes, and they lay\r\nheaped athwart the threshold with his dead body across them, Corinius’s\r\nsword-hilts jammed against his ribs and the blade standing a foot’s\r\nlength forth from his breast. And while they gazed, there walked\r\ninto the shifting light of the flamboys over that threshold the Lady\r\nPrezmyra, crowned and arrayed in her rich robes and ornaments of state.\r\nHer countenance was bleak as the winter moon flying high amid light\r\nclouds on a windy midnight settling towards rain, and those lords,\r\nunder the spell of her sad cold beauty, stood without speech.\r\n\r\nIn a while Juss, speaking as one who needeth to command his voice,\r\nand making grave obeisance to her, said, “O Queen, we give you peace.\r\nCommand our service in all things whatsoever. And first in this, which\r\nshall be our earliest task ere we sail homeward, to stablish you in\r\nyour rightful realm of Pixyland. But this hour is over-charged with\r\nfate and desperate deeds to suffer counsel. Counsel is for the morning.\r\nThe night calleth to rest. I pray you give us leave.”\r\n\r\nPrezmyra looked upon Juss, and there was eye-bite in her eyes, that\r\nglinted with green metallic lustre like those of a she-lion brought to\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n“Thou dost offer me Pixyland, my Lord Juss,” said she, “that am Queen\r\nof Impland. And this night, thou thinkest, can bring me rest. These\r\nthat were dear to me have rest indeed: my lord and lover Corund; the\r\nPrince my brother; Gro, that was my friend. Deadly enow they found you,\r\nwhether as friends or foes.”\r\n\r\nJuss said, “O Queen Prezmyra, the nest falleth with the tree. These\r\nthings hath Fate brought to pass, and we be but Fate’s whipping-tops\r\nbandied what way she will. Against thee we war not, and I swear to thee\r\nthat all our care is to make thee amends.”\r\n\r\n“O, thine oaths!” said Prezmyra. “What amends canst thou make? Youth I\r\nhave and some poor beauty. Wilt thou conjure those three dead men alive\r\nagain that ye have slain? For all thy vaunted art, I think this were\r\ntoo hard a task.”\r\n\r\nAll they were silent, eyeing her as she walked delicately past\r\nthe table. She looked with a distant and, to outward seeming,\r\nuncomprehending eye on the dead feasters and their empty cups. Empty\r\nall, save that one passed on by Viglus, whereof Corsus would not drink;\r\nand it stood half drained. Of curious workmanship it was, of pale\r\ngreen glass, its stand formed of three serpents intertwined, the one\r\nof gold, another of silver, the third of iron. Fingering it carelessly\r\nshe raised her glittering eyes once more on the Demons, and said, “It\r\nwas ever the wont of you of Demonland to eat the egg and give away the\r\nshell in alms.” And pointing at the lords of Witchland dead at the\r\nfeast, she asked, “Were these also your victims in this day’s hunting,\r\nmy lords?”\r\n\r\n“Thou dost us wrong, madam,” cried Goldry. “Never hath Demonland used\r\nsuchlike arts against her enemies.”\r\n\r\nLord Brandoch Daha looked swiftly at him, and stepped idly forward,\r\nsaying, “I know not what art hath wrought yon goblet, but ’tis\r\nstrangely like to one I saw in Impland. Yet fairer is this, and of more\r\njust proportions.” But Prezmyra forestalled his out-stretched hand, and\r\nquietly drew the cup towards her out of reach. As sword crosses sword,\r\nthe glance of her green eyes crossed his, and she said, “Think not that\r\nyou have a worse enemy left on earth than me. I it was that sent Corsus\r\nand Corinius to trample Demonland in the mire. Had I but some spark\r\nof masculine virtue, some soul at least of you should yet be loosed\r\nsquealing to the shades to attend my dear ones ere I set sail. But I\r\nhave none. Kill me then, and let me go.”\r\n\r\nJuss, whose sword was bare in his hand, smote it home in the scabbard\r\nand stepped towards her. But the table was betwixt them, and she drew\r\nback to the dais where Corund lay in state. There, like some triumphant\r\ngoddess, she stood above them, the cup of venom in her hand. “Come not\r\nbeyond the table, my lords,” she said, “or I drain this cup to your\r\ndamnation.”\r\n\r\nBrandoch Daha said, “The dice are thrown, O Juss. And the Queen hath\r\nwon the hazard.”\r\n\r\n“Madam,” said Juss, “I swear to you there shall no force nor restraint\r\nbe put upon you, but honour only and worship shown you, and friendship\r\nif you will. That surely mightest thou take of us for thy brother’s\r\nsake.” Thereat she looked terribly upon him, and he said, “Only on this\r\nwild night lay not hands upon yourself. For their sake, that even now\r\nhaply behold us out of the undiscovered barren lands, beyond the dismal\r\nlake, do not this.”\r\n\r\nStill facing them, the cup still aloft in her right hand, Prezmyra\r\nlaid her left hand lightly on the brazen plates of Corund’s byrny that\r\ncased the mighty muscles of his breast. Her hand touched his beard, and\r\ndrew back suddenly; but in an instant she laid it gently again on his\r\nbreast. Somewhat her orient loveliness seemed to soften for a passing\r\nminute in the altering light, and she said, “I was given to Corund\r\nyoung. This night I will sleep with him, or reign with him, among the\r\nmighty nations of the dead.”\r\n\r\nJuss moved as one about to speak, but she stayed him with a look, and\r\nthe lines of her body hardened again and the lioness looked forth\r\nanew in her peerless eyes. “Hath your greatness,” she said, “so much\r\noutgrown your wit, that you think I will abide to be your pensioner,\r\nthat have been a Princess in Pixyland, a Queen of far-fronted Impland,\r\nand wife to the greatest soldier in this hold of Carcë, which till this\r\nday hath been the only scourge and terror of the world? O my lords\r\nof Demonland, good comfortable fools, speak to me no more, for your\r\nspeech is folly. Go, doff your hats to the silly hind that runneth on\r\nthe mountain; pray her gently dwell with you amid your stalled cattle,\r\nwhen you have slain her mate. Shall the blackening frost, when it hath\r\nblasted and starved all the sweet garden flowers, say to the rose,\r\nAbide with us; and shall she harken to such a wolfish suit?”\r\n\r\nSo speaking she drank the cup; and turning from those lords of\r\nDemonland as a queen turneth her from the unregarded multitude, kneeled\r\ngently down by Corund’s bier, her white arms clasped about his head,\r\nher face pillowed on his breast.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nWhen Juss spake, his voice was choked with tears. He commanded Bremery\r\nthat they should take up the bodies of Corsus and Zenambria and those\r\nsons of Corund and of Corsus that lay poisoned and dead in that hall\r\nand on the morrow give them reverent burial. “And for the Lord Corinius\r\nI will that ye make a bed of state, that he may lie in this hall\r\nto-night, and to-morrow will we lay him in howe before Carcë, as is\r\nfitting for so renowned a captain. But great Corund and his lady shall\r\nnone depart one from the other, but in one grave shall they rest, side\r\nby side, for their love sake. Ere we be gone I will rear them such a\r\nmonument as beseemeth great kings and princes when they die. For royal\r\nand lordly was Corund, and a mighty man at arms, and a fighter clean of\r\nhand, albeit our bitter enemy. Wondrous it is with what cords of love\r\nhe bound to him this unparagoned Queen of his. Who hath known her like\r\namong women for trueness and highness of heart? And sure none was ever\r\nmore unfortunate.”\r\n\r\nNow went they forth into the outer ward of Carcë. The night bore still\r\nsome signs of that commotion of the skies that had so lately burst\r\nforth and passed away, and some torn palls of thundercloud yet hung\r\nathwart the face of heaven. Betwixt them in the swept places of the\r\nsky a few stars shivered, and the moon, more than half waxen towards\r\nher full, was sinking over Tenemos. Some faint breath of autumn was\r\nabroad, and the Demons shuddered a little, fresh from the heavy air\r\nof the great banquet hall. The ruins of the Iron Tower smoking to\r\nthe sky, and the torn and tumbled masses of masonry about it, showed\r\nmonstrous in the gloom as fragments of old chaos; and from them and\r\nfrom the riven earth beneath steamed up pungent fumes as of brimstone\r\nburning. Ever busily, back and forth through those sulphurous vapours,\r\nobscene birds of the night flitted a weary round, and bats on leathern\r\nwing, fitfully and dimly seem in the uncertain mirk, save when their\r\npassage brought them dark against the moon. And from the solitudes of\r\nthe mournful fen afar voices of lamentation floated on the night: wild\r\nwailing cries and sobbing noises and long moans rising and falling and\r\nquivering down to silence.\r\n\r\nJuss laid his hand on Goldry’s arm, saying, “There is nought earthly in\r\nthese laments, nor be those that thou seest circling in the reek very\r\nbats or owls. These be his masterless familiars wailing for their Lord.\r\nMany such served him, simple earthy divels and divels of the air and of\r\nthe water, held by him in thrall by sorcerous and artificial practices,\r\ncoming and going and doing his will.”\r\n\r\n“These availed him not,” said Goldry, “nor the sword of Witchland\r\nagainst our might and main, that brake it asunder in his hand and slew\r\nhis mighty men of valour.”\r\n\r\n“Yet true it is,” said Lord Juss, “that none greater hath lived on\r\nearth than King Gorice XII. When after these long wars we held him as\r\na stag at bay, he feared not to assay a second time, and this time\r\nunaided and alone, what no man else hath so much as once performed and\r\nlived. And well he knew that that which was summoned by him out of the\r\ndeep must spill and blast him utterly if he should slip one whit, as\r\nslip he did in former days, but his disciple succoured him. Behold now\r\nwith what loud striking of thunder, unconquered by any earthly power,\r\nhe hath his parting: with this Carcë black and smoking in ruin for his\r\nmonument, these lords of Witchland and hundreds besides of our soldiers\r\nand of the Witches for his funeral bake-meats, and spirits weeping in\r\nthe night for his chief mourners.”\r\n\r\nSo came they again to the camp. And in due time the moon set and the\r\nclouds departed and the quiet stars pursued their eternal way until\r\nnight’s decline; as if this night had been but as other nights: this\r\nnight which had beheld the power and glory that was Witchland by such a\r\nhammer-stroke of destiny smitten in pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  XXXIII: QUEEN SOPHONISBA IN GALING\r\n\r\n  OF THE ENTERTAINMENT GIVEN BY LORD JUSS IN DEMONLAND TO QUEEN\r\n      SOPHONISBA, FOSTERLING OF THE GODS, AND OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE\r\n      WHICH, BEYOND ALL THE WONDERS FAIR AND LOVELY TO BEHOLD SHOWN\r\n      HER IN THAT COUNTRY, MADE HER MOST TO MARVEL: WHEREIN IS A RARE\r\n      EXAMPLE HOW IN A FORTUNATE WORLD, OUT OF ALL EXPECTATION, IN\r\n      THE SPRING OF THE YEAR, COMETH A NEW BIRTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the returning months brought the season of the year when Queen\r\nSophonisba should come according to her promise to guest with Lord Juss\r\nin Galing. And so it was that in the hush of a windless April dawn the\r\nZimiamvian caravel that bare the Queen to Demonland rowed up the firth\r\nto Lookinghaven.\r\n\r\nAll the east was a bower for the golden dawn. Kartadza, sharp-outlined\r\nas if cut in bronze, still hid the sun; and in the great shadow of the\r\nmountain the haven and the low hills and the groves of holm-oak and\r\nstrawberry tree slumbered in a deep obscurity of blues and purples,\r\nagainst which the avenues of pink almond blossom and the white marble\r\nquays were bodied forth in pale wakening beauty, imaged as in a\r\nlooking-glass in that tranquillity of the sea. Westward across the\r\nfirth all the land was aglow with the opening day. Snow lingered\r\nstill on the higher summits. Cloudless, bathing in the golden light,\r\nthey stood against the blue: Dina, the Forks of Nantreganon, Pike\r\no’ Shards, and all the peaks of the Thornback range and Neverdale.\r\nMorning laughed on their high ridges and kissed the woods that clung\r\nabout their lower limbs: billowy woods, where rich hues of brown and\r\npurple told of every twig on all their myriad branches thick and\r\nafire with buds. White mists lay like coverlets on the water-meadows\r\nwhere Tivarandardale opens to the sea. On the shores of Bothrey and\r\nScaramsey, and on the mainland near the great bluff of Thremnir’s Heugh\r\nand a little south of Owlswick, clear spaces among the birchwoods\r\nshowed golden yellow: daffodils abloom in the spring.\r\n\r\nThey rowed in to the northernmost berth and made fast the caravel.\r\nThe sweetness of the almond trees was the sweetness of spring in the\r\nair, and spring was in the face of that Queen as she came with her\r\nattendants up the shining steps, her little martlets circling about her\r\nor perching on her shoulders: she to whom the Gods of old gave youth\r\neverlasting, and peace everlasting in Koshtra Belorn.\r\n\r\nLord Juss and his brethren were on the quay to meet her, and the Lord\r\nBrandoch Daha. They bowed in turn, kissing her hands and bidding her\r\nwelcome to Demonland. But she said, “Not to Demonland alone, my lords,\r\nbut to the world again. And toward which of all earth’s harbours should\r\nI steer, and toward which land if not to this land of yours, who have\r\nby your victories brought peace and joy to all the world? Surely peace\r\nslept not more softly on the Moruna in old days before the names of\r\nGorice and Witchland were heard in that country, than she shall sleep\r\nfor us on this new earth and Demonland, now that those names are\r\ndrowned for ever under the whirlpools of oblivion and darkness.”\r\n\r\nJuss said, “O Queen Sophonisba, desire not that the names of great men\r\ndead should be forgot for ever. So should these wars that we last year\r\nbrought to so mighty a conclusion to make us undisputed lords of the\r\nearth go down to oblivion with them that fought against us. But the\r\nfame of these things shall be on the lips and in the songs of men from\r\none generation to another, so long as the world shall endure.”\r\n\r\nThey took horse and rode up from the harbour to the upper road, and\r\nso through open pastures on to Havershaw Tongue. Lambs frisked on the\r\ndewy meadows beside the road; blackbirds flew from bush to bush; larks\r\ntrilled in the sightless sky; and as they came down through the woods\r\nto Beckfoot wood-pigeons cooed in the trees, and squirrels peeped with\r\nbeady eyes. The Queen spoke little. These and all shy things of the\r\nwoods and field held her in thrall, charming her to a silence that was\r\nbroken only now and then by a little exclamation of joy. The Lord Juss,\r\nwho himself also loved these things, watched her delight.\r\n\r\nNow they wound up the steep ascent from Beckfoot, and rode into Galing\r\nby the Lion Gate. The avenue of Irish yews was lined by soldiers of the\r\nbodyguards of Juss, Goldry, and Spitfire, and Brandoch Daha. These, in\r\nhonour of their great masters and of the Queen, lifted their spears\r\naloft, while trumpeters blew three fanfares on silver trumpets. Then\r\nto an accompaniment of lutes and theorbos and citherns moving above\r\nthe pulse of muffled drums, a choir of maidens sang a song of welcome,\r\nstrewing the path before the lords of Demonland and the Queen with\r\nsweet white hyacinths and narcissus blooms, while the ladies Mevrian\r\nand Armelline, more lovely than any queens of earth, waited at the head\r\nof the golden staircase above the inner court to greet Queen Sophonisba\r\ncome to Galing.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nA hard matter it were to tell of all the pleasures prepared for Queen\r\nSophonisba and for her delight by the lords of Demonland. The first\r\nday she spent among the parks and pleasure gardens of Galing, where\r\nLord Juss showed her his great lime avenues, his yew-houses, his fruit\r\ngardens and sunk gardens and his private walks and bowers; his walks of\r\ncreeping thyme which being trodden on sends up sweet odours to refresh\r\nthe treader; his ancient water-gardens beside the Brankdale Beck,\r\nwhither the water nymphs resort in summer and are seen under the moon\r\nsinging and combing their hair with combs of gold.\r\n\r\nOn the second day he showed her his herb gardens, disclosing to her\r\nthe secret properties of herbs, wherein he was deeply learned. There\r\ngrew that Zamalenticion, which being well beaten up with fat without\r\nsalt is sovran for all wounds. And Dittany, which if eaten soon puts\r\nout the arrow and healeth the wounds; and not only by its presence\r\nstayeth snakes wheresoever they be handy to it, but by reason of its\r\nsmell carried by wind and they smell it they die. And Mandragora, which\r\nbeing taken into the middle of an house compelleth all evils out of the\r\nhouse, and relieveth also headaches and produceth sleep. Also he showed\r\nher Sea Holly in his garden, that is born in secret places and in wet\r\nones, and the root of it is as the head of that monster which men name\r\nthe Gorgon, and the root-twigs have both eyes and nose and colour of\r\nserpents. Of this he told her how when taking up the root, a man must\r\nsee to it that no sun shine on it, and he who would carve it must avert\r\nhis head, for it is not permitted that man may see that root unharmed.\r\n\r\nThe third day Juss showed the Queen his stables, where were his\r\nwar-horses and horses for the chase and for chariot racing stabled in\r\nstalls with furniture of silver, and much she marvelled at his seven\r\nwhite mares, sisters, so like that none might tell one from another,\r\ngiven him in days gone by by the priests of Artemis in the lands beyond\r\nthe sunset. They were immortal, bearing ichor in their veins, not\r\nblood; and the fire of it showed in their eyes like lamps burning.\r\n\r\nThe fourth night and the fifth the Queen was at Drepaby, guesting with\r\nLord Goldry Bluszco and the Princess Armelline, that were wedded in\r\nZajë Zaculo last Yule; and the sixth and seventh nights at Owlswick,\r\nand there Spitfire made her lordly entertainment. But Lord Brandoch\r\nDaha would not have the Queen go yet to Krothering, for he had not yet\r\nmade fair again his gardens and pleasaunces and restored his rich and\r\ngoodly treasures to his mind after their ill handling by Corinius. And\r\nit was not his will that she should look on Krothering Castle until all\r\nwas there stablished anew according to its ancient glory.\r\n\r\nThe eighth day she came again to Galing, and now Lord Juss showed her\r\nhis study, with his astrolabes of orichalc, figured with all the signs\r\nof the Zodiac and the mansions of the moon, standing a tall man’s\r\nheight above the floor, and his perspectives and globes and crystals\r\nand hollow looking-glasses; and great crystal globes where he kept\r\nhomunculi whom he had made by secret processes of nature, both men and\r\nwomen, less than a span long, as beautiful as one could wish to see in\r\ntheir little coats, eating and drinking and going their ways in those\r\nmighty globes of crystal where his art had given them being.\r\n\r\nEvery night, whether at Galing, Owlswick, or Drepaby Mire, was feasting\r\nheld in her honour, with music and dancing and merry-making and all\r\ndelight, and poetical recitations and feats of arms and horsemanship,\r\nand masques and interludes the like whereof hath not been seen on\r\nearth for beauty and wit and all magnificence.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nNow was the ninth day come of the Queen’s guesting in Demonland, and\r\nit was the eve of Lord Juss’s birthday, when all the great ones in the\r\nland were come together, as four years ago they came, to do honour on\r\nthe morrow unto him and unto his brethren as was their wont aforetime.\r\nIt was fine bright weather, with every little while a shower to bring\r\nfresh sweetness to the air, colour and refreshment to the earth, and\r\ngladness to the sunshine. Juss walked with the Queen in the morning\r\nin the woods of Moongarth Bottom, now bursting into leaf; and after\r\ntheir mid-day meal showed her his treasuries cut in the live rock under\r\nGaling Castle, where she beheld bars of gold and silver piled like\r\ntrunks of trees; unhewn crystals of ruby, chrysoprase, or hyacinth, so\r\nheavy a strong man might not lift them; stacks of ivory in the tusk,\r\npiled to the ceiling; chests and jars filled with perfumes and costly\r\nspices, ambergris, frankincense, sweet-scented sandalwood and myrrh and\r\nspikenard; cups and beakers and eared wine-jars and lamps and caskets\r\nmade of pure gold, worked and chased with the forms of men and women\r\nand birds and beasts and creeping things, and ornamented with jewels\r\nbeyond price, margarites and pink and yellow sapphires, smaragds and\r\nchrysoberyls and yellow diamonds.\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen had had her fill of gazing on these, he carried\r\nher to his great library where statues stood of the nine Muses\r\nabout Apollo, and all the walls were hidden with books: histories\r\nand songs of old days, books of philosophy, alchymy and astronomy\r\nand art magic, romances and music and lives of great men dead and\r\ngreat treatises of all the arts of peace and war, with pictures and\r\nilluminated characters. Great windows opened southward on the garden\r\nfrom the library, and climbing rose-trees and plants of honeysuckle\r\nand evergreen magnolia clustered about the windows. Great chairs and\r\ncouches stood about the open hearth where a fire of cedar logs burned\r\nin winter time. Lamps of moonstones self-effulgent shaded with cloudy\r\ngreen tourmaline stood on silver stands on the table and by each couch\r\nand chair, to give light when the day was over; and all the air was\r\nsweet with the scent of dried rose-leaves kept in ancient bowls and\r\nvases of painted earthenware.\r\n\r\nQueen Sophonisba said, “My lord, I love this best of all the fair\r\nthings thou hast shown me in thy castle of Galing: here where all\r\ntrouble seems a forgotten echo of an ill world left behind. Surely\r\nmy heart is glad, O my friend, that thou and these other lords of\r\nDemonland shall now enjoy your goodly treasures and fair days in your\r\ndear native land in peace and quietness all your lives.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Juss stood at the window that looked westward across the lake\r\nto the great wall of the Scarf. Some shadow of a noble melancholy\r\nhovered about his sweet dark countenance as his gaze rested on a\r\ncurtain of rain that swept across the face of the mountain wall, half\r\nveiling the high rock summits. “Yet think, madam,” said he, “that we\r\nbe young of years. And to strenuous minds there is an unquietude in\r\nover-quietness.”\r\n\r\nNow he conducted her through his armouries where he kept his weapons\r\nand weapons for his fighting men and all panoply of war. There he\r\nshowed her swords and spears, maces and axes and daggers, orfreyed and\r\ndamascened and inlaid with jewels; byrnies and baldricks and shields;\r\nblades so keen, a hair blown against them in a wind should be parted\r\nin twain; charmed helms on which no ordinary sword would bite. And\r\nJuss said unto the Queen, “Madam, what thinkest thou of these swords\r\nand spears? For know well that these be the ladder’s rungs that we of\r\nDemonland climbed up by to that signiory and principality which now we\r\nhold over the four corners of the world.”\r\n\r\nShe answered, “O my lord, I think nobly of them. For an ill part it\r\nwere while we joy in the harvest, to contemn the tools that prepared\r\nthe land for it and reaped it.”\r\n\r\nWhile she spoke, Juss took down from its hook a great sword with a haft\r\nbound with plaited cords of gold and silver wire and cross-hilts of\r\nlatoun set with studs of amethyst and a drake’s head at either end of\r\nthe hilt with crimson almandines for his eyes, and the pommel a ball of\r\ndeep amber-coloured opal with red and green flashes.\r\n\r\n“With this sword,” said he, “I went up with Gaslark to the gates of\r\nCarcë, four years gone by this summer, being clouded in my mind by the\r\nback-wash of the sending of Gorice the King. With this sword I fought\r\nan hour back to back with Brandoch Daha, against Corund and Corinius\r\nand their ablest men: the greatest fight that ever I fought, and\r\nagainst the fearfullest odds. Witchland himself beheld us from Carcë\r\nwalls through the watery mist and glare, and marvelled that two men\r\nthat are born of woman could perform such deeds.”\r\n\r\nHe untied the bands of the sword and drew it singing from its sheath.\r\n“With this sword,” he said, looking lovingly along the blade, “I have\r\novercome hundreds of mine enemies: Witches, and Ghouls, and barbarous\r\npeople out of Impland and the southern seas, pirates of Esamocia and\r\nprinces of the eastern main. With this sword I gat the victory in many\r\na battle, and most glorious of all in the battle before Carcë last\r\nSeptember. There, fighting against great Corund in the press of the\r\nfight I gave him with this sword the wound that was his death-wound.”\r\n\r\nHe put up the sword again in its sheath: held it a minute as if\r\npondering whether or no to gird it about his waist: then slowly turned\r\nto its place on the wall and hung it up again. He carried his head high\r\nlike a war-horse, keeping his gaze averted from the Queen as they went\r\nout from the great armoury in Galing; yet not so skilfully but she\r\nmarked a glistening in his eye that seemed a tear standing above his\r\nlower eyelash.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThat night was supper set in Lord Juss’s private chamber: a light\r\nregale, yet most sumptuous. They sat at a round table, nine in company:\r\nthe three brethren, the Lords Brandoch Daha, Zigg, and Volle, the\r\nLadies Armelline and Mevrian, and the Queen. Brightly flowed the\r\nwines of Krothering and Norvasp and blithely went the talk to outward\r\nseeming. But ever and again silence swung athwart the board, like a\r\ngray pall, till Zigg broke it with a jest, or Brandoch Daha or his\r\nsister Mevrian. The Queen felt the chill behind their merriment. The\r\nsilent fits came oftener as the feast went forward, as if wine and good\r\ncheer had lost their native quality and turned fathers of black moods\r\nand gloomy meditations.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Goldry Bluszco, that till now had spoke little, spake now not\r\nat all, his proud dark face fixed in staid pensive lines of thought.\r\nSpitfire too was fallen silent, his face leaned upon his hand, his brow\r\nbent; and whiles he drank amain, and whiles he drummed his fingers\r\non the table. The Lord Brandoch Daha leaned back in his ivory chair,\r\nsipping his wine. Very demure, through half-closed eyes, like a\r\npanther dozing in the noon-day, he watched his companions at the feast.\r\nLike sunbeams chased by cloud-shadows across a mountain-side in windy\r\nweather, the lights of humorous enjoyment played across his face.\r\n\r\nThe Queen said, “O my lords, you have promised me I should hear the\r\nfull tale of your wars in Impland and the Impland seas, and how you\r\ncame to Carcë and of the great battle that there befell, and of the\r\nlatter end of all the lords of Witchland and of Gorice XII. of memory\r\naccursed. I pray you let me hear it now, that our hearts may be\r\ngladdened by the tale of great deeds the remembrance whereof shall be\r\nfor all generations, and that we may rejoice anew that all the lords\r\nof Witchland are dead and gone because of whom and their tyranny earth\r\nhath groaned and laboured these many years.”\r\n\r\nLord Juss, in whose face when it was at rest she had beheld that same\r\nmelancholy which she had marked in him in the library that same day,\r\npoured forth more wine, and said, “O Queen Sophonisba, thou shalt hear\r\nit all.” Therewith he told all that had befallen since they last bade\r\nher adieu in Koshtra Belorn: of the march to the sea at Muelva; of\r\nLaxus and his great fleet destroyed and sunk off Melikaphkhaz; of the\r\nbattle before Carcë and its swinging fortunes; of the unhallowed light\r\nand flaring signs in heaven whereby they knew of the King’s conjuring\r\nagain in Carcë; of their waiting in the night, armed at all points,\r\nwith charms and amulets ready against what dreadful birth might be\r\nfrom the King’s enchantments; of the blasting of the Iron Tower, and\r\nthe storming of the hold in pitch darkness; of the lords of Witchland\r\nmurthered at the feast, and nought left at last of the power and pomp\r\nand terror that was Witchland save dying embers of a funeral fire and\r\nvoices wailing in the wind before the dawn.\r\n\r\nWhen he had done, the Queen said, as if talking in a dream, “Surely it\r\nmay be said of these kings and lords of Witchland dead—\r\n\r\n      These wretched eminent things\r\n    Leave no more fame behind ’em than should one\r\n    Fall in a frost, and leave his print in snow;\r\n    As soon as the sun shines, it ever melts\r\n    Both form and matter.”\r\n\r\nWith those words spoken dropped silence again like a pall athwart that\r\nbanquet table, more tristful than before and full of heaviness.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden Lord Brandoch Daha stood up, unbuckling from his shoulder\r\nhis golden baldrick set with apricot-coloured sapphires and diamonds\r\nand fire-opals that imaged thunderbolts. He threw it before him on the\r\ntable, with his sword, clattering among the cups. “O Queen Sophonisba,”\r\nsaid he, “thou hast spoken a fit funeral dirge for our glory as for\r\nWitchland’s. This sword Zeldornius gave me. I bare it at Krothering\r\nSide against Corinius, when I threw him out of Demonland. I bare it at\r\nMelikaphkhaz. I bare it in the last great fight in Witchland. Thou wilt\r\nsay it brought me good luck and victory in battle. But it brought not\r\nto me, as to Zeldornius, this last best luck of all: that earth should\r\ngape for me when my great deeds were ended.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen looked at him amazed, marvelling to see him so much moved\r\nthat she had known until now so lazy mocking and so debonair.\r\n\r\nBut the other lords of Demonland stood up and flung down their jewelled\r\nswords on the table beside Lord Brandoch Daha’s. And Lord Juss spake\r\nand said, “We may well cast down our swords as a last offering on\r\nWitchland’s grave. For now must they rust: seamanship and all high\r\narts of war must wither: and, now that our great enemies are dead and\r\ngone, we that were lords of all the world must turn shepherds and\r\nhunters, lest we become mere mountebanks and fops, fit fellows for\r\nthe chambering Beshtrians or the Red Foliot. O Queen Sophonisba, and\r\nyou my brethren and my friends, that are come to keep my birthday\r\nwith me to-morrow in Galing, what make ye in holiday attire? Weep ye\r\nrather, and weep again, and clothe you all in black, thinking that our\r\nmightiest feats of arms and the high southing of the bright star of\r\nour magnificence should bring us unto timeless ruin. Thinking that we,\r\nthat fought but for fighting’s sake, have in the end fought so well\r\nwe never may fight more; unless it should be in fratricidal rage each\r\nagainst each. And ere that should betide, may earth close over us and\r\nour memory perish.”\r\n\r\nMightily moved was the Queen to behold such a violent sorrow, albeit\r\nshe could not comprehend the roots and reason of it. Her voice shook\r\na little as she said, “My Lord Juss, my Lord Brandoch Daha, and you\r\nother lords of Demonland, it was little in mine expectation to find in\r\nyou such a passion of sour discontent. For I came to rejoice with you.\r\nAnd strangely it soundeth in mine ear to hear you mourn and lament your\r\nworst enemies, at so great hazard of your lives and all you held dear,\r\nstruck down by you at last. I am but a maid and young in years, albeit\r\nmy memory goeth back two hundred springs, and ill it befitteth me to\r\ncounsel great lords and men of war. Yet strange it seemeth if there be\r\nnot peaceful enjoyment and noble deeds of peace for you all your days,\r\nwho are young and noble and lords of all the world and rich in every\r\ntreasure and high gifts of learning, and the fairest country in the\r\nworld for your dear native land. And if your swords must not rust, ye\r\nmay bear them against the uncivil races of Impland and other distant\r\ncountries to bring them to subjection.”\r\n\r\nBut Lord Goldry Bluszco laughed bitterly. “O Queen,” he cried, “shall\r\nthe correction of feeble savages content these swords, which have\r\nwarred against the house of Gorice and against all his chosen captains\r\nthat upheld the great power of Carcë and the glory and the fear\r\nthereof?”\r\n\r\nAnd Spitfire said, “What joy shall we have of soft beds and delicate\r\nmeats and all the delights that be in many-mountained Demonland, if we\r\nmust be stingless drones, with no action to sharpen our appetite for\r\nease?”\r\n\r\nAll were silent awhile. Then the Lord Juss spake saying, “O Queen\r\nSophonisba, hast thou looked ever, on a showery day in spring, upon the\r\nrainbow flung across earth and sky, and marked how all things of earth\r\nbeyond it, trees, mountain sides, and rivers, and fields, and woods,\r\nand homes of men, are transfigured by the colours that are in the bow?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said, “and oft desired to reach them.”\r\n\r\n“We,” said Juss, “have flown beyond the rainbow. And there we found no\r\nfabled land of heart’s desire, but wet rain and wind only and the cold\r\nmountain-side. And our hearts are a-cold because of it.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen said, “How old art thou, my Lord Juss, that thou speakest as\r\nan old man might speak?”\r\n\r\nHe answered, “I shall be thirty-three years old to-morrow, and that\r\nis young by the reckoning of men. None of us be old, and my brethren\r\nand Lord Brandoch Daha younger than I. Yet as old men may we now look\r\nforth on our lives, since the goodness thereof is gone by for us.” And\r\nhe said, “Thou O Queen canst scarcely know our grief; for to thee the\r\nblessed Gods gave thy heart’s desire: youth for ever, and peace. Would\r\nthey might give us our good gift, that should be youth for ever, and\r\nwar; and unwaning strength and skill in arms. Would they might but\r\ngive us our great enemies alive and whole again. For better it were we\r\nshould run hazard again of utter destruction, than thus live out our\r\nlives like cattle fattening for the slaughter, or like silly garden\r\nplants.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s eyes were large with wonder. “Thou couldst wish it?” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nJuss answered and said, “A true saying it is that ‘a grave is a rotten\r\nfoundation.’ If thou shouldst proclaim to me at this instant the great\r\nKing alive again and sitting again in Carcë, bidding us to the dread\r\narbitrament of war, thou shouldst quickly see I told thee truth.”\r\n\r\nWhile Juss spake, the Queen turned her gaze from one to another round\r\nthe board. In every eye, when he spake of Carcë, she saw the lightning\r\nof the joy of battle as of life returning to men held in a deadly\r\ntrance. And when he had done, she saw in every eye the light go out.\r\nLike Gods they seemed, in the glory of their youth and pride, seated\r\nabout that table; but sad and tragical, like Gods exiled from wide\r\nHeaven.\r\n\r\nNone spake, and the Queen cast down her eyes, sitting as if wrapped\r\nin thought. Then the Lord Juss rose to his feet, and said, “O Queen\r\nSophonisba, forgive us that our private sorrows should make us so\r\nforgetful of our hospitality as weary our guest with a mirthless feast.\r\nBut think ’tis because we know thee our dear friend we use not too\r\nmuch ceremony. To-morrow we will be merry with thee, whate’er betide\r\nthereafter.”\r\n\r\nSo they bade good-night. But as they went out into the garden under the\r\nstars, the Queen took Juss aside privately and said to him, “My lord,\r\nsince thou and my Lord Brandoch Daha came first of mortal men into\r\nKoshtra Belorn, and fulfilled the weird according to preordainment,\r\nthis only hath been my desire: to further you and to enhance you and\r\nto obtain for you what you would, so far as in me lieth. Though I be\r\nbut a weak maid, yet hath it seemed good to the blessed Gods to show\r\nkindness unto me. One holy prayer may work things we scarce dare dream\r\nof. Wilt thou that I pray to Them to-night?”\r\n\r\n“Alas, dear Queen,” said he, “shall those estranged and divided\r\nashes unite again? Who shall turn back the flood-tide of unalterable\r\nnecessity?”\r\n\r\nBut she said, “Thou hast crystals and perspectives can show thee things\r\nafar off. I pray bring them, and row me in thy boat up to Moonmere Head\r\nthat we may land there about midnight. And let my Lord Brandoch Daha\r\ncome with us and thy brothers. But let none else know of it. For that\r\nwere but to mock them with a false dawn, if it should prove at last to\r\nbe according to thy wisdom, O my lord, and not according to my prayers.”\r\n\r\nSo the Lord Juss did according to the word of that fair Queen, and they\r\nrowed her up the lake by moonlight. None spake, and the Queen sate\r\napart in the bows of the boat, in earnest supplication to the blessed\r\nGods. When they were come to the head of the lake they went ashore on\r\na little spit of silver sand. The April night was above them, mild\r\nwith moonlight. The shadows of the fells rose inky black and beyond\r\nimagination huge against the sky. The Queen kneeled awhile in silence\r\non the cold ground, and those lords of Demonland stood together in\r\nsilence watching her.\r\n\r\nIn a while she raised her eyes to heaven; and behold, between the two\r\nmain peaks of the Scarf, a meteor crept slowly out of darkness and\r\nacross the night-sky, leaving a trail of silver fire, and silently\r\ndeparted into darkness. They watched, and another came, and yet\r\nanother, until the western sky above the mountain was ablaze with them.\r\nFrom two points of heaven they came, one betwixt the foreclaws of the\r\nLion and one in the dark sign of Cancer. And they that came from the\r\nLion were sparkling like the white fires of Rigel or Altair, and they\r\nthat came from the Crab were haughty red, like the lustre of Antares.\r\nThe lords of Demonland, leaning on their swords, watched these portents\r\nfor a long while in silence. Then the travelling meteors ceased, and\r\nthe steadfast stars shone lonely and serene. A soft breeze stirred\r\namong the alders and willows by the lake. The lapping waters lapping\r\nthe shingly shore made a quiet tune. A nightingale in a coppice on a\r\nlittle hill sang so passionate sweet it seemed some spirit singing. As\r\nin a trance they stood and listened, until that singing ended, and a\r\nhush fell on water and wood and lawn. Then all the east blazed up for\r\nan instant with sheet lightnings, and thunder growled from the east\r\nbeyond the sea.\r\n\r\nThe thunder took form so that music was in the heavens, filling earth\r\nand sky as with trumpets calling to battle, first high, then low, then\r\nshuddering down to silence. Juss and Brandoch Daha knew it for that\r\ngreat call to battle which had preluded that music in the dark night\r\nwithout her palace, in Koshtra Belorn, when first they stood before\r\nher portal divine. The great call went again through earth and air,\r\nsounding defiance; and in its train new voices, groping in darkness,\r\nrising to passionate lament, hovering, and dying away on the wind, till\r\nnought remained but a roll of muffled thunder, long, low, quiet, big\r\nwith menace.\r\n\r\nThe Queen turned to Lord Juss. Surely her eyes were like two stars\r\nshining in the gloom. She said in a drowned voice, “Thy perspectives,\r\nmy lord.”\r\n\r\nSo the Lord Juss made a fire of certain spices and herbs, and smoke\r\nrose in a thick cloud full of fiery sparks, with a sweet sharp smell.\r\nAnd he said, “Not we, O my Lady, lest our desires cheat our senses. But\r\nlook thou in my perspectives through the smoke, and say unto us what\r\nthou shalt behold in the east beyond the unharvested sea.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen looked. And she said, “I behold a harbour town and a sluggish\r\nriver coming down to the harbour through a mere set about with mud\r\nflats, and a great waste of fen stretching inland from the sea. Inland,\r\nby the river side, I behold a great bluff standing above the fens. And\r\nwalls about the bluff, as it were a citadel. And the bluff and the\r\nwalled hold perched thereon are black like old night, and like throned\r\niniquity sitting in the place of power, darkening the desolation of\r\nthat fen.”\r\n\r\nJuss said, “Are the walls thrown down? Or is not the great round tower\r\nsouth-westward thrown down in ruin athwart the walls?”\r\n\r\nShe said, “All is whole and sound as the walls of thine own castle, my\r\nlord.”\r\n\r\nJuss said, “Turn the crystal, O Queen, that thou mayest see within the\r\nwalls if any persons be therein, and tell us their shape and seeming.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen was silent for a space, gazing earnestly in the crystal.\r\nThen she said, “I see a banquet hall with walls of dark green jasper\r\nspeckled with red, and a massy cornice borne up by giants three-headed\r\ncarved in black serpentine; and each giant is bowed beneath the weight\r\nof a huge crab-fish. The hall is seven-sided. Two long tables there\r\nbe and a cross-bench. There be iron braziers in the midst of the hall\r\nand flamboys burning in silver stands, and revellers quaffing at the\r\nlong tables. Some dark young men black of brow and great of jaw, most\r\nsoldier-like, brothers mayhap. Another with them, ruddy of countenance\r\nand kindlier to look on, with long brown moustachios. Another that\r\nweareth a brazen byrny and sea-green kirtle; an old man he, with sparse\r\ngray whiskers and flabby cheeks; fat and unwieldy; not a comely old man\r\nto look upon.”\r\n\r\nShe ceased speaking, and Juss said, “Whom seest thou else in the\r\nbanquet hall, O Queen?”\r\n\r\nShe said, “The flare of the flamboys hideth the cross-bench. I will\r\nturn the crystal again. Now I behold two diverting themselves with dice\r\nat the table before the cross-bench. One is well-looking enough, well\r\nknit, of a noble port, with curly brown hair and beard and keen eyes\r\nlike a sailor. The other seemeth younger in years, younger than any\r\nof you, my lords. He is smooth shaved, of a fresh complexion and fair\r\ncurling hair, and his brow is wreathed with a festal garland. A most\r\nbig broad strong and seemly young man. Yet is there a somewhat maketh\r\nme ill at ease beholding him; and for all his fair countenance and\r\nroyal bearing he seemeth displeasing in mine eyes.\r\n\r\n“There is a damosel there too, watching them while they play. Showily\r\ndressed she is, and hath some beauty. Yet scarce can I commend her—”\r\nand, ill at ease on a sudden, the Queen suddenly put down the crystal.\r\n\r\nThe eye of Lord Brandoch Daha twinkled, but he kept silence. Lord Juss\r\nsaid, “More, I entreat thee, O Queen, ere the reek be gone and the\r\nvision fade. If this be all within the banquet hall, seest thou nought\r\nwithout?”\r\n\r\nQueen Sophonisba looked again, and in a while said, “There is a terrace\r\nfacing to the west under the inner wall of that fortress of old night,\r\nand walking on it in the torchlight a man crowned like a King. Very\r\ntall he is: lean of body, and long of limb. He weareth a black doublet\r\nbedizened o’er with diamonds, and his crown is in the figure of a\r\ncrab-fish, and the jewels thereof out-face the sun in splendour. But\r\nscarce may I mark his apparel for looking on the face of him, which is\r\nmore terrible than the face of any man that ever I saw. And the whole\r\naspect of the man is full of darkness and power and terror and stern\r\ncommand, that spirits from below earth must tremble at and do his\r\nbidding.”\r\n\r\nJuss said, “Heaven forfend that this should prove but a sweet and\r\ngolden dream, and we wake to-morrow to find it flown.”\r\n\r\n“There walketh with him,” said the Queen, “in intimate converse, as\r\nof a servant talking to his lord, one with a long black beard curly\r\nas the sheep’s wool and glossy as the raven’s wing. Pale he is as the\r\nmoon in daylight hours, slender, with fine-cut features and great dark\r\neyes, and his nose hooked like a reaping-hook; gentle-looking and\r\nmelancholy-looking, yet noble.”\r\n\r\nLord Brandoch Daha said, “Seest thou none, O Queen, in the lodgings\r\nthat be in the eastern gallery above the inner court of the palace?”\r\n\r\nThe Queen answered, “I see a lofty bed-chamber hung with arras. It is\r\ndark, save for two branching candlesticks of lights burning before a\r\ngreat mirror. I see a lady standing before the mirror, crowned with\r\na queen’s crown of purple amethysts on her deep hair that hath the\r\ncolour of the tipmost tongues of a flame. A man cometh through the\r\ndoor behind her, parting the heavy hangings left and right. A big man\r\nhe is, and looketh like a king, in his great wolf-skin mantle and his\r\nkirtle of russet velvet with ornaments of gold. His bald head set about\r\nwith grizzled curls and his bushy beard flecked with gray speak him\r\nsomething past his prime; but the light of youth burns in his eager\r\neyes and the vigour of youth is in his tread. She turneth to greet him.\r\nTall she is, and young she is, and beautiful, and proud-faced, and\r\nsweet-faced, and most gallant-hearted too, and merry of heart too, if\r\nher looks belie her not.”\r\n\r\nQueen Sophonisba covered her eyes, saying, “My lords, I see no more.\r\nThe crystal curdles within like foam in a whirlpool under a high force\r\nin rainy weather. Mine eyes grow sore with watching. Let us row back,\r\nfor the night is far spent and I am weary.”\r\n\r\nBut Juss stayed her and said, “Let me dream yet awhile. The double\r\npillar of the world, that member thereof which we, blind instruments of\r\ninscrutable Heaven, did shatter, restored again? From this time forth\r\nto maintain, I and he, his and mine, ageless and deathless for ever,\r\nfor ever our high contention whether he or we should be great masters\r\nof all the earth? If this be but phantoms, O Queen, thou’st ’ticed us\r\nto the very heart of bitterness. This we could have missed, unseen\r\nand unimagined: but not now. Yet how were it possible the Gods should\r\nrelent and the years return?”\r\n\r\nBut the Queen spake, and her voice was like the falling shades of\r\nevening, pulsing with hidden splendour, as of a sense of wakening\r\nstarlight alive behind the fading blue. “This King,” she said, “in the\r\nwickedness of his impious pride did wear on his thumb the likeness of\r\nthat worm Ouroboros, as much as to say his kingdom should never end.\r\nYet was he, when the appointed hour did come, thundered down into the\r\ndepths of Hell. And if now he be raised again and his days continued,\r\n’tis not for his virtue but for your sake, my lords, whom the Almighty\r\nGods do love. Therefore I pray you possess your hearts awhile with\r\nhumility before the most high Gods, and speak no unprofitable words.\r\nLet us row back.”\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nDawn came golden-fingered, but the lords of Demonland lay along abed\r\nafter their watch in the night. About the third hour before noon,\r\nthe presence was filled in the high presence chamber, and the three\r\nbrethren sat upon their thrones, as four years ago they sat, between\r\nthe golden hippogriffs, and beside them were thrones set for Queen\r\nSophonisba and Lord Brandoch Daha. All else of beauty and splendour\r\nin Galing Castle had the Queen beheld, but not till now this presence\r\nchamber; and much she marvelled at its matchless beauties and rarities,\r\nthe hangings and the carvings on the walls, the fair pictures, the\r\nlamps of moonstone and escarbuncle self-effulgent, the monsters on the\r\nfour-and-twenty pillars, carved in precious stones so great that two\r\nmen might scarce circle them with their arms, and the constellations\r\nburning in that firmament of lapis lazuli below the golden canopy. And\r\nwhen they drank unto Lord Juss the cup of glory to be, wishing him long\r\nyears and joy and greatness for ever more, the Queen took a little\r\ncithern saying, “O my lord, I will sing a sonnet to thee and to you my\r\nlords and to sea-girt Demonland.” So saying, she smote the strings, and\r\nsang in that crystal voice of hers, so true and delicate that all that\r\nwere in that hall were ravished by its beauty:\r\n\r\n    Shall I compare thee to a Summers day?\r\n      Thou art more lovely and more temperate:\r\n    Rough windes do shake the darling buds of Maie,\r\n      And Sommers lease hath all too short a date:\r\n    Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\r\n      And often is his gold complexion dimn’d;\r\n    And every faire from faire some-time declines,\r\n      By chance or natures changing course untrim’d;\r\n        But thy eternall Sommer shall not fade\r\n          Nor loose possession of that faire thou ow’st;\r\n        Nor shall Death brag thou wandr’st in his shade.\r\n          When in eternall lines to time thou grow’st:\r\n    So long as men can breath, or eyes can see,\r\n    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\r\n\r\nWhen she had done, Lord Juss rose up very nobly and kissed her hand,\r\nsaying, “O Queen Sophonisba, fosterling of the Gods, shame us not with\r\npraises that be too high for mortal men. For well thou knowest what\r\nthing alone might bring us content. And ’tis not to be thought that\r\nthat which was seen at Moonmere Head last night was very truth indeed,\r\nbut rather the dream of a night vision.”\r\n\r\nBut Queen Sophonisba answered and said, “My Lord Juss, blaspheme not\r\nthe bounty of the blessed Gods, lest They be angry and withdraw it,\r\nWho have granted unto you of Demonland from this day forth youth\r\neverlasting and unwaning strength and skill in arms, and—but hark!” she\r\nsaid, for a trumpet sounded at the gate, three strident blasts.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of that trumpet blown, the lords Goldry and Spitfire\r\nsprang from their seats, clapping hand to sword. Lord Juss stood like a\r\nstag at gaze. Lord Brandoch Daha sat still in his golden chair, scarce\r\nchanging his pose of easeful grace. But all his frame seemed alight\r\nwith action near to birth, as the active principle of light pulses and\r\ngrows in the sky at sunrise. He looked at the Queen, his eyes filled\r\nwith a wild surmise. A serving man, obedient to Juss’s nod, hastened\r\nfrom the chamber.\r\n\r\nNo sound was there in that high presence chamber in Galing till in a\r\nminute’s space the serving man returned with startled countenance,\r\nand, bowing before Lord Juss, said, “Lord, it is an Ambassador from\r\nWitchland and his train. He craveth present audience.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  THE WORM\r\n  OUROBOROS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ARGUMENT: WITH DATES\r\n\r\n[Dates _Anno Carces Conditae_.
