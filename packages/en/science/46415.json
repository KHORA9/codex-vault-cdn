O. Bower dealing with the life of the late Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker. Our veteran botanist passed away on Dec. 10, 1911, in\r\nhis 95th year, and in him botany loses its outstanding personality as\r\nwell as its principal link with the past. The history of botany in this\r\ncountry during the Victorian period, when it comes to be written, must\r\nof necessity be woven around the life of this great man.\r\n\r\nFor the excellent index to the book the reader is indebted to Dr E.\r\nde Fraine, whose care and good judgment in this matter will be fully\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\n  F.

At the time\r\nwhen the arrangements were being made for publication the University of\r\nLondon Press had not yet reached the publishing stage, so hospitality\r\nhad to be sought elsewhere. That the book is issued from the Cambridge\r\nUniversity Press is largely due to the good offices of Prof. A. C.\r\nSeward.\r\n\r\nIn consenting to publish _The Makers of British Botany_ the Cambridge\r\nUniversity Press suggested that some additional chapters should be\r\nprepared so that the work might be more fully representative. This has\r\nbeen done so far as was possible in the time available.\r\n\r\nThe sixteen chapters forming the book include (1) the ten lectures,\r\nwhich are printed essentially as they were delivered, (2) six\r\nadditional chapters specially written under the circumstances just\r\nmentioned. As a rule each chapter will be found to deal with a single\r\nBotanist; with the exception of the first and last chapters. In the\r\nformer Prof. Vines has linked together Morison and Ray, the founders\r\nof Systematic Botany in this country, whilst in the last Prof. Bayley\r\nBalfour has expanded what was originally intended as a sketch of his\r\nfather, the late Prof. J. Hutton Balfour, into a very interesting\r\naccount of his predecessors in the Edinburgh chair from the year 1670\r\nalmost down to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe subjects treated, the authors and the order of arrangement are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------+-----+------+----------------------------\r\n  Subject                     |Born | Died |   Author\r\n  ----------------------------+-----+------+----------------------------\r\n  *Robert Morison             |1620 | 1683}| } Prof. S.

These are pioneers and the names of Ray, Grew,\r\nand Hales must always remain illustrious in the annals of Botanical\r\nScience.\r\n\r\nJOHN HILL, with all his versatility, belongs to another plane, but his\r\ninclusion here is justified on historical grounds, by the prominent\r\npart he played in making known the method of the great Swedish\r\nsystematist Linnaeus, a method which took deep root and gave an immense\r\nstimulus to systematic studies in this country.\r\n\r\nIn ROBERT BROWN we have the greatest botanist of his day, for thirty\r\nyears keeper of the Botanical Department of the British Museum. It is\r\ndoubtful if any greater intellect than Brown's has ever been devoted to\r\nthe service of Botanical Science.\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM HOOKER was the first Director of Kew, and under his genial\r\nadministration the foundations of that great institution were most\r\ntruly laid. Born under the star of Linnaeus, his own researches lay in\r\nthe systematic field--more especially among the Ferns and Bryophytes.\r\n\r\nJ. S. HENSLOW was for many years Professor of Botany at Cambridge,\r\nbut it is his life as Rector of Hitcham in Suffolk that finds special\r\nprominence in the interesting Memoir which formed the subject-matter of\r\nhis son's lecture. The account given of his educational methods will be\r\nread with interest in these days when \"Nature Study\" has been sprung on\r\nthe world as a new thing.\r\n\r\nJOHN LINDLEY was a man of the most amazing energy and his scientific\r\noutput was prodigious. Though he attained high distinction in many\r\nfields of Botany, being an accomplished Systematist and Palaeobotanist,\r\nprobably his greatest service was on the scientific side of\r\nHorticulture. Considering the scale of production, the work of Lindley\r\nmaintains a remarkably high level. It is recorded of him that he never\r\ntook a holiday till he reached the age of 52. His was the dominant\r\npersonality in Botany of the early and mid-Victorian era.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM GRIFFITH had the energy and power of endurance of Lindley,\r\nunder whose influence he came. Trained to the practice of medicine he\r\ntook service under the East India Company where he was able to devote\r\nthe priceless intervals between his official duties to botanical\r\ntravel, collecting, and the morphological investigation of Indian\r\nplants. The results of his brief but remarkable career are embodied\r\nmainly in his voluminous illustrated notes which were published\r\nposthumously in 1852. The name of Griffith has been happily linked with\r\nthat of Treub, his brilliant successor in our own times.\r\n\r\nARTHUR HENFREY belonged to a very different type. Compelled by\r\nill-health to the life of a recluse, his short life was mainly\r\ndevoted to making known in England the great discoveries of the\r\nHofmeisterian epoch. To Henfrey belongs the credit of being the first\r\nof our countrymen to recognise the full significance of the new\r\nmorphology, the general recognition of which, however, he did not live\r\nto see. Henfrey was an extremely competent all-round Botanist whose\r\nsingle-minded devotion to his subject should not be allowed to fall\r\ninto oblivion.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HENRY HARVEY is a representative of a numerous class among the\r\nfollowers of Botany in this country. A man of great personal charm\r\nand high culture, he was attracted into the subject from the love of\r\ncollecting. His special field was that of the Marine Algae, in which he\r\nstood unrivalled. Harvey was an exquisite delineator of the seaweeds\r\nof which he was so enthusiastic a student. The memoir, based on his\r\njournals and letters, which was published shortly after his death, is a\r\nbook well worth reading for its intimate sketches of the naturalists of\r\nhis day and the vivid notes on his extended travels in the colonies and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nMILES JOSEPH BERKELEY, like his contemporary Harvey, was a cryptogamic\r\nbotanist. He was a voluminous contributor to the systematic literature\r\nof the Fungi over a period of fifty years, as well as being a pioneer\r\nin the field of plant pathology. The systematic collections accumulated\r\nduring his long life form one of the glories of the Kew Herbarium.\r\n\r\nSIR JOSEPH HENRY GILBERT'S outlook on plants was entirely different\r\nfrom that of any of the foregoing. He regarded the plant essentially\r\nas the chemical offspring of the environment to which it was exposed.\r\nHis life was devoted to the study of soils and crops in conjunction\r\nwith Sir John Lawes. To these classic investigations carried out at\r\nRothamsted, Gilbert brought the trained skill of the chemist.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CRAWFORD WILLIAMSON was a great all-round naturalist of the\r\nVictorian period whose work as a Zoologist gained him high distinction\r\nlong before his attention became seriously concentrated upon his famous\r\nstudies into the structure of the fossil plants of the Coal Measures.\r\nThough these researches were pursued without any marked contemporary\r\nencouragement, at any rate until the closing years of his life, the\r\nfield in which Williamson was so enthusiastic a pioneer has since\r\nhis time been generally recognised as of the first importance--more\r\nespecially in its bearing upon the pedigree of the vegetable kingdom.\r\nTo-day, no branch of Botany has more recruits or is more vigorously\r\npursued in this country than that of Palaeobotany, and so long as the\r\nscience remains will the memory of Williamson be green.\r\n\r\nHARRY MARSHALL WARD belongs to a generation younger than any of the\r\nforegoing. His student days coincided with the renaissance of Botany\r\nin England in the seventies of the last century, and coming under the\r\ninfluence of Huxley, Thiselton-Dyer, Vines and others, Ward early\r\nrevealed himself as an ardent investigator. For twenty-five years he\r\ndevoted his remarkable energies to a series of connected researches\r\nbearing broadly on the nutrition of the Fungi and allied organisms with\r\nespecial reference to the relationships between host and parasite. The\r\nnotice of his career which appears in this volume is from the pen of\r\nSir William Thiselton-Dyer. Recently printed in the Obituary Notices\r\nof Fellows of the Royal Society, we are indebted to the courtesy of\r\nthe author and of the Council of the Royal Society for permission to\r\ninclude it here.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a book like the present, the work of a large number of distinct\r\ncontributors, it is evident that no continuous or homogeneous treatment\r\nof the history and progress of Botany in this country is possible.\r\nJudged even as a series of essays or studies of representative men,\r\n_The Makers of British Botany_ will not escape criticism, so long as\r\nspecial reference to the work of Priestley, Cavendish and Sénébier\r\nfinds no place in its pages, not to mention such obvious omissions as\r\nKnight, Daubeny and Bentham. These omissions have not been deliberate\r\nand it will no doubt be possible to repair them should a second edition\r\nof the work be called for. The case of Charles Darwin is different.\r\nApart from the work for which he is most famous, Darwin was a great\r\ninvestigator of the movements of plants and of the biology of flowers.\r\nAs this aspect of Darwin's work has received adequate treatment in\r\nthe recent centenary volume published by the Cambridge University\r\nPress[1], it has not seemed necessary on the present occasion to\r\ntraverse the ground again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reader of _The Makers of British Botany_ will judge, and we think\r\nrightly, that Botany has had its ups and downs in this country. At\r\nthe end of the seventeenth century England was contributing her full\r\nshare to the foundation and advancement of the subject. In the field\r\nof Systematic Botany Ray, at any rate, left his permanent influence\r\nas a taxonomist, whilst in Plant Anatomy, the offspring of the newly\r\ninvented microscope, Grew divided the honours with his brilliant\r\ncontemporary Malpighi. A few years later Stephen Hales was carrying\r\nout the famous experiments which are embodied in his _Vegetable\r\nStaticks_, entitling him to be justly regarded as the Father of plant\r\nphysiology. Notwithstanding so admirable a beginning, the next century\r\nwas almost a blank. The essay on John Hill serves to illustrate the\r\nsterility of this period. The dominant influence in Botany in the\r\neighteenth century was that of Linnaeus, whose genius as a taxonomist\r\ngave the most wonderful impulse to the study of Botany that it has ever\r\nreceived. Shorn of its accumulated dead-weight of nomenclature, the\r\nsimplified Botany of Linnaeus took deep root in this country and here\r\nfor a century it reigned supreme as a source of inspiration. Fed on\r\nunlimited collections of plants from all parts of a growing Empire, it\r\nis hardly surprising that a great British school of Systematic Botany\r\nled by Robert Brown, the Hookers, Lindley and Bentham should have\r\narisen. What is remarkable is the almost exclusive persistence of this\r\nbranch of Botany for more than a generation after the establishment and\r\nrecognition of other departments on the continent of Europe. Whilst we\r\nmade a shrine for the Linnaean collections, so far as we were concerned\r\nGrew and Hales might never have lived; even the rational and scientific\r\nmorphology created by Hofmeister in the forties of last century failed\r\nto deflect us from our course!\r\n\r\nIt was only in the later seventies that the New Botany came to England,\r\nwhither it was imported from Germany. For a while, as was to be\r\nexpected, our Universities were kept busy in training students in the\r\nmodern work and in the conduct of investigations in the fields thus\r\nopened. With acclimatisation certain distinctive branches which may be\r\nregarded as characteristic have come to the front. These include more\r\nespecially the study of anatomy in its phylogenetic aspects with which\r\nis closely linked that of the palaeozoic fossils, so richly represented\r\nin some of our coal-fields as to constitute a virtual monopoly. The\r\npresent wide-spread revival of interest in palaeobotany is in no small\r\nmeasure attributable to Williamson, who, in spite of discouragement,\r\nkept the subject alive till the modern movement was firmly enough\r\nestablished to take up his work. Another productive field has been\r\nthat of the nuclear cytology of both higher and lower plants, whilst\r\nphysiology, especially on the chemical side, has attained pre-eminence.\r\nOn present indications it is to be expected that in the near future\r\nphysiology will receive much more attention than hitherto, partly as\r\nan inevitable reaction from the field of pure structure, and partly\r\nbecause of its fundamental importance in relation to agriculture.\r\nNor is this the only branch that should be greatly stimulated by the\r\nforward movement in Agriculture that is now just beginning to be felt.\r\nThe science of plant breeding, too long neglected by the countrymen\r\nof Darwin, has been pursued with much success for a decade, and has\r\nalready reached the \"producing stage\" in respect of new and improved\r\nraces of agricultural plants.\r\n\r\nThe youngest branch of Botany is Ecology or the study of vegetation\r\nin relation to habitat--particularly soil in its widest sense.\r\nThis department deals with the recognition and distribution of the\r\ndifferent types of plant community in relation to topography and\r\nthe factors--chemical, physical and biologic--which determine this\r\ndistribution. Ecology has the great merit of taking its followers into\r\nthe field, where they are confronted with a wide range of problems not\r\nhitherto regarded as strictly within the province of the botanist.\r\nAt the same time it exacts the most critical acquaintance with the\r\nminutiae of the taxonomist, so that a new sphere of usefulness is\r\nopened to the systematist. Ecology should have a great part to play\r\nin helping to break down the frontiers which have too long tended to\r\nseparate Botany from the other sciences, and the maintenance of which\r\nis not in the true interests of the subject.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] _Darwin and Modern Science_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT MORISON AND JOHN RAY\r\n\r\n1620-1683          1627-1705\r\n\r\nBY SYDNEY HOWARD VINES\r\n\r\n  Early systems of classification--Theophrastus--the\r\n  Herbalists--Cesalpino's _De Plantis_--Caspar Bauhin's _Pinax\r\n  Theatri Botanici_--MORISON--narrative--Botany at Oxford--the\r\n  garden established--Jacob Bobart the elder--Morison's _Historia\r\n  Plantarum_--completion by the younger Bobart--personal\r\n  characteristics--Morison's works--the _Praeludia_--the\r\n  _Hallucinationes_--the _Dialogus_--principles of method in his\r\n  _Plantarum Umbelliferarum Distributio Nova_--posthumous publication\r\n  of System--indebtedness to Cesalpino--Linnaeus' estimate of\r\n  Morison--RAY--narrative--first attempt at a System--quarrel\r\n  with Morison--the _Methodus Nova_--Dicotyledones and\r\n  Monocotyledones--Linnaeus' criticisms--later Systems--the French\r\n  school--Morison and Ray compared.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe literature of Botany can be traced back to a quite respectable\r\nantiquity, to the period of Aristotle (B.C. 384-322) who seems to\r\nhave been the first to write of plants from the truly botanical\r\npoint of view. Unfortunately, his special treatise on plants--θεωρία\r\nπερὶ φυτῶν [Greek: theôria peri phytôn]--is lost; and although there\r\nare many botanical passages scattered throughout his other writings\r\n(which have been collected by Wimmer, _Phytologiae Aristotelicae\r\nFragmenta_, 1836), yet none of them gives any indication of what his\r\nideas of classification may have been. An echo of them is perhaps to\r\nbe found in the works of his favourite pupil, Theophrastus Eresius\r\n(B.C. 371-286), who among all his fellows was the most successful in\r\npursuing the botanical studies that they had begun under the guidance\r\nof the master. Theophrastus left behind him two important, though\r\nincomplete, treatises on plants, the oldest that have survived: the\r\nmore familiar Latin titles of which are _De Historia Plantarum_ and\r\n_De Causis Plantarum_. The latter is essentially physiological,\r\ntouching upon agriculture to a certain extent: the former is mainly\r\nmorphological, structural, descriptive, and it is here that the first\r\nattempt at a classification of plants is to be found. In writing the\r\n_Historia_, Theophrastus was endeavouring, as a Greek philosopher\r\nrather than as a botanist, to \"give account of\" plants; and in order\r\nto do so he found it necessary to arrange them in some kind of order.\r\nSeizing upon obvious external features, he distinguished (_Lib._\r\nI. _cap_. 5) and defined Tree, Shrub, Undershrub and Herb, giving\r\nexamples; adding, however, that the definitions are to be accepted\r\nand understood as typical and general, \"for some may seem perhaps\r\nto deviate\" from them. Simple as was this mode of arrangement,\r\nTheophrastus further simplified it in the course of his work, by\r\ntreating trees and shrubs as one group, and undershrubs and herbs as\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Plate I_ Robert Morison (Robertus Morison)\r\n\r\n  _Quæ Morisone viro potuit contingere major\r\n  Gloria, Pæonium quam superasse genus?\r\n\r\n  Ipse tibi palmam Phœbus concedit Apollo,\r\n  Laureaque est capiti quælibit herba tuo._\r\n\r\n  _Archibaldi Pitcairne M.D_.]\r\n\r\nIt may seem, at first sight, singular that a lecture purporting to\r\ndiscuss the state of systematic botany in England during the 17th\r\ncentury should begin with a reference to the botany of the Greeks.\r\nThe explanation is that the elementary classification introduced\r\nby Theophrastus persisted throughout the 17th century; the use of\r\nthe groups Trees, Shrubs, and Herbs came to an end only in the 18th\r\ncentury, with the advent of Linnaeus. It seems almost incredible, but\r\nit is a fact, that the lapse of the nearly 2000 years that separated\r\nTheophrastus from Morison marked no material advance in the science of\r\nclassification. Botanical works, when they were something more than\r\ncommentaries on Theophrastus or Dioscorides, took cognizance of little\r\nelse than the properties, medicinal or otherwise, of plants, and their\r\neconomic uses.\r\n\r\nA growing perception of the essential resemblances observable among\r\nplants can be traced, however, in the later Herbals, as they became\r\nless medical and economic and more definitely botanical. Thus, in the\r\nwell-known work of Leonhard Fuchs (Fuchsius), _De Historia Stirpium\r\nCommentarii_, 1542, the plants are described in alphabetical order,\r\nwithout any reference to their mutual relation. But in Kyber's\r\nedition of Jerome Bock's (Tragus) _De Stirpium Nomenclatura, etc._,\r\n_Commentariorum Libri Tres_, published in 1552 (with a preface by\r\nConrad Gesner), there is an attempt at a grouping of plants, though no\r\nprinciples are enunciated and no names are given to the groups, which\r\nresulted in the bringing together of labiate, leguminous, gramineous\r\nand umbelliferous herbs. The _Cruydtboeck_ of Rembert Dodoens\r\n(Dodonaeus), 1554, marks much the same stage of progress, whereas\r\nthe _Nova Stirpium Adversaria_ of Pierre Pena and Matthias de l'Obel\r\n(Lobelius), issued in 1570, is a distinct step in advance. Here some\r\nidea is incidentally given of the principles that have been followed\r\nin the arrangement of the plants, but still no name is attached, as a\r\nrule, to the resulting groups. The work begins with an account of the\r\nherbaceous plants which, in modern terminology, are monocotyledonous:\r\nand at the end of the section (p. 65) de l'Obel thus explains what he\r\nhas done:--\"_Hactenus comparendo quot potuimus plantarum genera, quarum\r\neffigies et naturae ordinis consequutione ita sibi mutuo haererent,\r\nut et facillime noscerentur et memoriae mandarentur, a Gramineis,\r\nSegetibus, Harundinibus, ad Acoros, Irides, Cyperos, hincque Asphodelos\r\nbulborum tuniceorum Caepaceorumve naturam praetervecti sumus._\"\r\nCruciferous, caryophyllaceous, labiate and umbelliferous herbs are also\r\nsegregated to some extent in the course of the work: and the leguminous\r\nherbs are brought together into a definite group, \"_Alterum Frugum\r\ngenus nempe graminis Trifolii et Leguminum_,\" which is really the\r\norigin of the modern N. O. Leguminosae: though a few altogether foreign\r\nspecies, such as species of _Oxalis_, _Anemone Hepatica_, _Jasminum\r\nfruticans_ L., and species of _Thalictrum_, are included among the\r\ntrifoliate forms, and _Dictamnus Fraxinella_ among the \"Leguminosa.\"\r\nThe _Stirpium Historiae Pemptades Sex sive Libri XXX_ of Dodoens,\r\npublished in 1583, shows considerable progress in classification as\r\ncompared with his _Cruydtboeck_ of 1554, more particularly in the\r\nrecognition, apparently for the first time, of umbelliferous plants as\r\na distinct group in a chapter headed _De Umbelliferis Herbis_.\r\n\r\nPossibly these attempts to introduce some sort of system into Botany\r\nmay have been inspired by the teachings of Conrad Gesner, that\r\nuniversal genius, who lived about this time (1516-1565). Though but\r\nfragments of his botanical writings have survived, it is clear from the\r\nmuch-quoted passage in a letter of his dated Nov. 26, 1565 (_Epistolae\r\nMedicae_, 1577, p. 113) that he too was seeking for the basis of a\r\nnatural system of classification and that he thought he had found it in\r\nthe flower and the fruit:--\"_Ex his enim notis_ (_a fructu_, _semine_\r\nand _flore_) _potius quam foliis, stirpium naturae et cognationes\r\napparent_.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently at this period classification was in the air, and at length\r\nit began to precipitate and to crystallise in the work of Andrea\r\nCesalpino (Caesalpinus: 1519-1603), Professor in the University of\r\nPisa, whose _De Plantis Libri XVI_, published in 1583, is one of the\r\nmost important landmarks in the history of systematic Botany. Here for\r\nthe first time a system is propounded which is based definitely upon\r\nmorphological observation. Cesalpino turns to the \"fructification,\"\r\nthat is the flower and the fruit, for his distinguishing characters.\r\n\"_Enitamur igitur_,\" he says (Lib. I. _cap._ xiv.), \"_ex propriis quae\r\nfructificationis gratia data sunt, plantarum genera investigare_\"; and\r\nhe goes on to point out that the observable differences here depend on\r\nnumber, position and form of the parts:--\"_ad organorum constitutionem\r\ntria maxime faciant, scilicet, partium numerus, situs et figura_.\"\r\nThese principles he illustrates as follows:--the flower being the\r\noutermost covering of the fruit, a single flower may cover a single\r\nseed, as in the Almond: or a single seed-receptacle as in the Rose:\r\nor two seeds, as in the Umbelliferae: or two seed-receptacles, as in\r\nthe Cress: or three seeds, as in the genus _Tithymalus_ (_Euphorbia_);\r\nor three receptacles, as in the Bulbaceous plants (petaloid\r\nMonocotyledons): or four seeds, as in _Marrubium_: or four receptacles,\r\nas in _Euonymus_: or many seeds, as in the Cichoriaceae: or many\r\nreceptacles, as in the Coniferae. The feature of the relative position\r\nof the parts which he especially emphasizes is whether the flower\r\nis inserted upon the top of the fruit (_i.e._ is epigynous): or is\r\ninserted lower around the fruit (hypogynous or perigynous). Moreover,\r\nthe form of the seed, of the seed-receptacle, and of the flower, is to\r\nbe taken into account.\r\n\r\nThe practical application of these principles led to a classification\r\nof plants which, though of course imperfect, was at least a good\r\nbeginning. Following Theophrastus, Cesalpino divided plants into two\r\nmain groups, (1) Trees and Shrubs, (2) Undershrubs and Herbs: each of\r\nthese groups was then subdivided according to the nature of the fruit\r\nand of the flower. It will be observed that Cesalpino, as was customary\r\nat that time, designated as \"seeds\" all indehiscent one-seeded fruits,\r\nsuch as nuts and the varieties of achene. The following abstract will\r\nsuffice to give an adequate idea of the results obtained. The author's\r\nown words are given as nearly as possible.\r\n\r\n  ARBOREAE: =Seminibus saepius solitariis=:\r\n\r\n  Glandiferae: _e.g._ _Quercus_.\r\n  Vasculiferae: _Fagus_, _Castanea_.\r\n  Nuciferae: _Juglans_, _Carpinus_, _Corylus_, _Ulmus_, _Tilia_,\r\n                     _Acer_, &c.\r\n  Pericarpio tectae; flore in sede fructus: _Prunus_, &c.\r\n                     flore in apice fructus: _Viburnum_, _Aesculus_, &c.\r\n\r\n      =Seminibus pluribus=:\r\n\r\n  Flore carentes: _Ficus_.\r\n  Flos in summo fructus: _Morus_, _Sambucus_, _Hedera_, _Rosa_, &c.\r\n  Flos in sede fructus: _Vitis_, _Arbutus_, _Cornus_, &c.\r\n  Sedes seminis multiplex tecta communi corpore: _Pyrus_, _Citrus_.\r\n    \"      \"    in siliquam producta: leguminous plants.\r\n    \"      \"    bipartita: _Nerium_, _Syringa_, _Populus_, _Betula_,\r\n                      _Salix_, &c.\r\n    \"      \"    tripartita: _Buxus_, _Myrtus_.\r\n    \"      \"    quadripartita: _Vitex_, _Euonymus_.\r\n    \"      \"    tecta proprio corpore: coniferous plants.\r\n\r\n  HERBACEAE: =Solitariis Seminibus=:\r\n\r\n  Semina nuda, papposa: _Valeriana_.\r\n  Semina pericarpio obducta: _Daphne_, _Jasminum_.\r\n  Flos in summo fructus: _Osyris_, _Valerianella_.\r\n  Flos in sede fructus, semen calyce exceptum: _Urtica_, Chenopodiaceae,\r\n    Polygonaceae, Gramineae, Cyperaceae, Typhaceae.\r\n\r\n      =Solitariis Pericarpiis=:\r\n\r\n  Flos exterius situs (Pomum): Cucurbitaceae.\r\n  Flos inferius situs (Bacca): Solanaceae, _Ruscus_, _Arum_,\r\n                               _Actaea_, &c.\r\n\r\n      =Solitariis Vasculis=:\r\n\r\n  Legumina: leguminous herbs.\r\n  Capsulae: Caryophyllaceae, Primulaceae, Gentianaceae, &c.\r\n\r\n      =Binis Seminibus=: (Genus Ferulaceum) Umbelliferae.\r\n\r\n      =Binis Conceptaculis=:\r\n\r\n  Semina solitaria in singulis alveolis: Rubiaceae.\r\n    \"    plura, flore continuo: Scrophulariaceae, &c.\r\n    \"      \"    flore in foliola quaterna diviso: Cruciferae.\r\n\r\n      =Triplici Principio, non-Bulbosae=:\r\n\r\n  Semina nuda: _Thalictrum_.\r\n     \"   solitaria in tribus alveolis: Euphorbiaceae.\r\n     \"   plura in tribus alveolis: Convolvulaceae, Campanulaceae, &c.\r\n\r\n      =Triplici Principio, Bulbosae=:\r\n\r\n  Flos inferius sedet: bulbous Liliaceae.\r\n  Flos in summo fructus: Amaryllidaceae.\r\n  Bulbaceis ascribi desiderant: other Liliaceae, Iridaceae, Orchidaceae.\r\n\r\n       =Quaternis Seminibus=: Boraginaceae, Labiatae.\r\n\r\n      =Pluribus Seminibus in communi sede=: most Compositae.\r\n\r\n  Lactescentes: Cichorieae.\r\n  Acanaceae: Cynareae, _Dipsacus_, _Eryngium_, &c.\r\n\r\n      =Pluribus Seminibus Flore communi=:\r\n\r\n  Semina plene nuda: acheniferous Ranunculaceae and Rosaceae, &c.\r\n  Aut conjunctis receptaculis: _e.g._ _Aristolochia_, _Nymphaea_,\r\n                               _Papaver_, _Cistus_.\r\n  Aut disjunctis receptaculis: _e.g._ _Sedum_, _Veratrum_, _Helleborus_,\r\n                               _Delphinium_, _Dictamnus_.\r\n\r\n      =Flore fructuque carentes=: Cryptogams.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its inherent imperfections and of errors of observation,\r\nthe method succeeded in bringing together a considerable number of the\r\nplants dealt with, into groups which are still regarded as natural. For\r\ninstance, among the trees and shrubs, the leguminous genera, and the\r\nconiferous genera, respectively, are so brought together: and among\r\nherbs, the leguminous, umbelliferous, cruciferous and composite genera.\r\nMoreover, though many of Cesalpino's sections consist of what seems to\r\nbe a heterogeneous assemblage of plants, yet they include groups of\r\nclosely allied genera, representing several of the natural orders of\r\nmore modern times, which his method was incapable of distinguishing.\r\nWith all its shortcomings, the method produced a classification of\r\nplants which has proved to have been natural in no slight degree.\r\n\r\nThe very numerous botanical works which were published in the\r\ncentury after the appearance of Cesalpino's _De Plantis_ afford\r\nevidence that his system of classification did not meet with an\r\nenthusiastic reception. Though his plant-names were generally\r\nquoted, his arrangement was entirely ignored: in fact the very idea\r\nof classification seems to have gradually faded out of the minds\r\nof botanists, whose attention was more and more engrossed with the\r\ndescription of the new species that the rapid extension of geographical\r\ndiscovery was bringing to light. This condition of the science is\r\nwell illustrated by the most authoritative systematic work that the\r\n17th century produced, the great _Pinax Theatri Botanici_ (1623) of\r\nCaspar Bauhin (1560-1624), a work which contains about six thousand\r\nplant-names, and was the product of forty years' labour. It might be\r\nexpected that in such a work, special attention would have been paid\r\nto classification, that at least the best available system would have\r\nbeen used: as a matter of fact, the arrangement adopted is far inferior\r\nto that of Cesalpino and may be described as simply haphazard for the\r\nmost part. The general lines of it are indicated by the following\r\nenumeration of the contents of the twelve Books of which the work\r\nconsists; the modern equivalents of his plant-names being given.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE ARRANGEMENT ADOPTED IN BAUHIN'S _Pinax_.\r\n\r\n  Liber I.

Jung is best known by his _Isagoge\r\nPhytoscopica_ (1678, ed. Vaget), the most philosophic and scientific\r\ntreatise on plants that had appeared since the time of Aristotle,\r\nwhich is the foundation upon which the whole superstructure of\r\nplant-morphology and descriptive botany has since been erected. But it\r\nwas in his _De Plantis Doxoscopiae Physicae Minores_ (1662, ed. Fogel)\r\nthat he expressed his views on systematic Botany. He did not propound\r\na system of his own, but he sought to arrive at the principles upon\r\nwhich a classification should be based, with the logical result that he\r\nrejected the time-honoured Theophrastian division of plants into Trees\r\nand Herbs. Though Jung failed to produce any immediate impression upon\r\nthe Botany of his time, he powerfully influenced the great developments\r\nwhich took place in the eighteenth century. It so happened that Ray, as\r\nhe mentions in his _Index Plantarum Agri Cantabrigiensis_ (1660), had\r\nobtained through Samuel Hartlib a MS. of the whole or part of Jung's\r\n_Isagoge_, which seems to have impressed him so much that he included\r\nmany of Jung's morphological definitions in the glossary appended to\r\nthe _Index_; and he subsequently embodied the _Isagoge_ in the first\r\nvolume of his _Historia Plantarum_ (1686). It was from Ray's _Historia_\r\nthat Linnaeus learned the morphological principles and terminology of\r\nJung which were the basis of his own work in descriptive Botany, and\r\nrendered possible the elaboration of his system of classification. But,\r\nin spite of Jung, the venerable division of plants into Trees and Herbs\r\ncontinued to hold its own for a time. As will be seen, it was still\r\nadhered to by Morison and by Ray, even after it had been shown to be\r\nquite untenable by Rivinus (_Introductio Generalis in Rem Herbariam_)\r\nin 1690, and did not finally disappear until the time of Linnaeus.\r\n\r\nIt was just when systematic Botany had fallen back to its lowest level\r\nthat Morison appeared upon the scene. He had been born at Aberdeen in\r\n1620, and had there graduated Master of Arts with distinction by the\r\ntime he was eighteen years old. His further studies in the natural\r\nsciences were interrupted by the Civil War, in which he took part on\r\nthe Royalist side, being severely wounded in the battle of the Brig of\r\nDee (1644). He fled to France, and there resumed his preparation for\r\na scientific career with such success that he obtained, in 1648, the\r\ndegree of Doctor of Medicine at the University of Angers. From that\r\ntime onwards he devoted himself entirely to the study of Botany, which\r\nhe pursued in Paris under the guidance of Vespasian Robin, Botanist\r\nto the King of France. In 1650 Morison was appointed by the Duke of\r\nOrleans, on Robin's recommendation, to take charge of the royal garden\r\nat Blois, a post which he held for ten years. The Duke of Orleans,\r\nshortly before his death early in 1660, had occasion to present Morison\r\nto his nephew King Charles II who was about to return to his kingdom.\r\nSoon after the Restoration, the King summoned Morison to London; and\r\nin spite of tempting offers made to induce him to remain in France,\r\nMorison obeyed the summons and was rewarded with the title of King's\r\nPhysician and Professor of Botany with a stipend of two hundred pounds\r\na year. During his tenure of these offices Morison found time to\r\ncomplete his first botanical work, the _Praeludia Botanica_, which was\r\npublished in 1669; the same year in which he was appointed Professor of\r\nBotany in the University of Oxford.\r\n\r\nA few words may be devoted, at this point, to the rise and progress of\r\nBotany in that University. In the year 1621, Lord Danvers (afterwards\r\nEarl of Danby), thinking \"that his money could not be better laid\r\nout than to begin and finish a place whereby learning, especially\r\nthe Faculty of Medicine, might be improved,\" decided to endow the\r\nUniversity with a Physic Garden, such as was already possessed by\r\nvarious Universities on the Continent. With this object, he gave a\r\nsum of £250 to enable the University to purchase the lease of a plot\r\nof ground, about five acres in extent, situated \"without the East\r\nGate of Oxford, near the river Cherwell.\" A great deal of labour had\r\nto be expended upon the land after it had been secured: it was so\r\nlow-lying that, as Anthony Wood says, \"much soil was conveyed thither\r\nfor the raising of the ground to prevent the overflowing of the\r\nwaters\" at the expense of Lord Danvers, who also caused to be built\r\nwhat Baskerville describes as \"a most stately wall of hewen stone 14\r\nfoot high with 3 very considerable Gates thereto, one whereof was to\r\nthe cost of at least five hundred pounds.\" The work proceeded but\r\nslowly, in consequence of the troublous times through which the country\r\nwas passing, so that it was not completed until 1632. Even then the\r\nactual installation of the garden was delayed. About 1637 the Earl\r\nof Danby seems to have arranged with the well-known John Tradescant\r\nto act as gardener, but there is no evidence that Tradescant ever\r\ndischarged the duties of the post: moreover, he died in the following\r\nyear. Very shortly after this, though the exact date is not known,\r\nthe Earl appointed Jacob Bobart to take charge of the Garden. Jacob\r\nBobart was a German, born at Brunswick about the year 1599. He was an\r\nexcellent gardener: under his care the garden flourished so well that\r\nthe catalogue which was published in 1648 anonymously, though doubtless\r\ndrawn up by Bobart, enumerated no less than 1600 species of plants in\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nIt had been the intention of Lord Danby to provide the University not\r\nonly with a Physic Garden and a Gardener, but also with a Professor of\r\nBotany. For this purpose he bequeathed certain revenues: \"but so it was\r\nthat the times being unsettled, and the revenues falling short, nothing\r\nwas done in order to the settling of a Professor till 1669.\" When the\r\nestablishment of the Professorship had become possible, the University\r\nproceeded to elect Morison the first Professor of Botany, being\r\ninfluenced by the reputation which his recently published _Praeludia\r\nBotanica_ had secured for him. Thus, after the lapse of nearly half a\r\ncentury, was Lord Danby's design completely realised.\r\n\r\nMorison's chief occupation at Oxford was the preparation of his\r\nlong promised _magnum opus_, the _Historia Plantarum Universalis\r\nOxoniensis_. It was planned on a most extensive scale, and proved to\r\nbe a laborious and costly undertaking. Morison impoverished himself\r\nin the preparation even of the one volume of it that appeared in his\r\nlifetime, though his many friends provided the cost of the 126 plates\r\nof figures with which it is illustrated, and the University advanced\r\nconsiderable sums of money. The work was to have been issued in three\r\nparts: the first part was to be devoted to Trees and Shrubs, and the\r\nother two parts to the Herbs. The volume published by Morison in 1680,\r\nand described as _Pars Secunda_, deals with only five out of the\r\nfifteen sections into which he classified herbaceous plants, although\r\nit extends to more than 600 folio pages. In the preface he gives as\r\nhis reason for beginning with the Herbs rather than with the Trees and\r\nShrubs, that he wished to accomplish first the most difficult part of\r\nhis task lest, in the event of his death before the completion of the\r\n_Historia_, it should fall into the hands of incompetent persons. He\r\ndid not live to finish his great undertaking. In November, 1683, he was\r\nin London on business connected with it: as he was crossing the Strand\r\nnear Charing Cross, he was knocked down by a coach, and was so severely\r\ninjured that he died on the following day. He was buried in the church\r\nof St Martin-in-the-Fields.\r\n\r\nHis unfinished work did not, as he feared, fall into incompetent hands.\r\nIt was entrusted by the University to Jacob Bobart the younger, who on\r\nthe death of his father in 1679, had succeeded him as Keeper of the\r\nPhysic Garden, and who also succeeded Morison as _Horti Praefectus_,\r\nbut not as _Professor Botanices_; the Professorship remained in\r\nabeyance for nearly forty years. After much difficulty and delay, a\r\nsecond and final instalment of the _Historia_, the _Pars Tertia_,\r\ndealing with the remaining ten sections of herbaceous plants, was\r\npublished in 1699, as a folio of 657 pages with 168 plates. The\r\nmaterial at Bobart's disposal was fairly abundant, consisting of\r\nMorison's MS. of four more of his sections of Herbs, with notes upon\r\nthe remaining six sections. But even so, the task of completion was a\r\nlaborious one, for it involved the incorporation of references to the\r\nvery many descriptions of new plants that had been published since\r\nMorison's death: it has been generally admitted that Bobart discharged\r\nit with commendable skill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate II_\r\n\r\nGreat Gate of the Physic Garden Oxford: the elder Bobart in the\r\nforeground]\r\n\r\nThe _Pars Prima_, that was to have been devoted to Trees and Shrubs,\r\nwas never written. All that exists to represent it, is a stout MS.\r\nvolume in the Library at the Botanic Garden, Oxford, apparently in\r\nBobart's hand-writing, containing a classification and an enumeration\r\nof the species of trees and shrubs, which may possibly have been\r\nwritten with a view to publication.\r\n\r\nA most interesting feature of Bobart's _Pars Tertia_ is the _Vita\r\nRoberti Morisoni M.D._ with which the book opens, written by one of\r\nMorison's intimate friends, Dr Archibald Pitcairn. It is the source\r\nof all the available information regarding Morison up to the time of\r\nhis coming to Oxford; after that time much may be gathered concerning\r\nhim from the records of the University. It is also a loyal defence\r\nof Morison and his system of classification against the criticisms\r\nto which, even then, he had been subjected. It concludes with a\r\npersonal account of Morison, in which he is described as being\r\n\"vigorous in body, having a mind trained to every kind of study, of\r\ningenuous manners, calling a spade a spade, eager for true knowledge,\r\na despiser of filthy lucre, considering the public advantage rather\r\nthan his private gain.\" A portrait of him, here reproduced, forms the\r\nfrontispiece to the volume.\r\n\r\nSuch was the life of the man whose botanical works are now to be\r\nconsidered: works that are not nearly so numerous as they are\r\nconsiderable, as will be seen from the following enumeration and brief\r\ndescription of them.\r\n\r\n_Praeludia Botanica_, 1669: a small 8vo volume of about 500 pages,\r\nwhich consists of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  (pp. 1-347): _Hortus Regius Blesensis Auctus._\r\n\r\n  (pp. 351-459): _Hallucinationes Caspari Bauhini in Pinace, item\r\n  Animadversiones in tres Tomos Universalis Historiae Johannis\r\n  Bauhini_.\r\n\r\n  (pp. 463-499): _Dialogus inter Socium Collegii Regii Gresham dicti\r\n  et Botanographum Regium_.\r\n\r\n_Plantarum Umbelliferarum Distributio Nova, per Tabulas Cognationis et\r\nAffinitatis, ex Libro Naturae observata et detecta_, 1672.\r\n\r\n_Plantarum Historiae Universalis Oxoniensis Pars Secunda, seu Herbarum\r\nDistributio Nova per Tabulas Cognationis et Affinitatis ex Libro\r\nNaturae observata et detecta_, 1680.\r\n\r\nThe three distinct treatises of which the _Praeludia Botanica_\r\nconsists were written probably at different times, though published\r\nsimultaneously in 1669. The first of them is an alphabetical catalogue,\r\ncomprising about 2600 species, of the plants in the Royal garden at\r\nBlois when under Morison's care: 260 of the species are marked as new,\r\nand are fully described in an appendix. But the chief interest of\r\nthe _Hortus Regius Blesensis Auctus_ lies in the dedication to King\r\nCharles II. Morison here narrates how, whilst at Blois, he had framed\r\na system of classification; how the King's Uncle, the Duke of Orleans,\r\nhad promised to undertake the publication of a book to illustrate\r\nthe system on an adequate scale, and how the sudden death of the\r\nDuke in 1660 had destroyed all such hopes; and he ends by appealing\r\nto the King to give him the patronage that he so much needed. \"_Quod\r\nsi annuere hoc mihi digneris_,\" he wrote, \"_polliceor Britanniam\r\nvestram cum methodo exactissima (quae est naturae ipsius) imposterum,\r\nin re Botanica gloriari posse, quemadmodum Italia, Gallia, Germania,\r\nsuperiori saeculo, sine methodo, in Scientia Botanica gloriatae sunt._\"\r\nBut the King does not appear to have been moved by this dazzling\r\npromise. Morison evidently did not suffer from any lack of confidence\r\nin himself or in his method, of which he speaks on a previous page of\r\nthe dedication, as \"_methodus nova a natura data, a me solummodo (citra\r\njactantiam) observata: a nullo nisi meipso in hunc usque diem detecta,\r\nquamvis mundi incunabilis sit coeva_,\" language which can hardly be\r\ndescribed as modest. And yet, curiously enough, Morison gives not the\r\nslightest indication of the principles of this altogether new and\r\noriginal method of classification.\r\n\r\nThe second treatise, the _Hallucinationes_, is a searching and acute\r\ncriticism of the published works of the brothers Bauhin: of the _Pinax_\r\nof Caspar, and of the _Historia_ of John. Though he acknowledges in\r\nthe preface the great value of their botanical labours, Morison did\r\nnot fail to set out in detail the mistakes that they had made in both\r\nclassification and nomenclature, and to make corrections which were,\r\nfor the most part, justified. Probably it was the critical study\r\nof the works of the Bauhins that led Morison to frame a system of\r\nclassification of his own.\r\n\r\nThe third and last treatise is the _Dialogus_: a dialogue between\r\nhimself, as _Botanographus Regius_, King's Botanist, and a Fellow\r\nof the Royal Society, on the theme of classification. Here again\r\nMorison asserts the superiority of his own method: \"_Methodum me\r\nobservasse fateor: estque omnium quae unquam adhuc fuerunt exhibitae,\r\npraestantissima et certissima quippe a natura data_.\" But he still\r\nfails to give any definite account of it: all that he says amounts\r\nmerely to this, that the \"_nota generica_\" is not to be sought in the\r\nproperties of a plant, nor in the shape of its leaves, as had been\r\nsuggested by earlier writers, but in the fructification, that is, in\r\nthe flower and fruit (_essentiam plantarum desumendam ... a florum\r\nforma at seminum conformatione_).\r\n\r\nThe mention of a system of classification based on the form of\r\nthe leaf evoked from _Botanographus_ a pointed allusion to a book\r\nrecently published by a Fellow of the Royal Society in which such a\r\nclassification had been used, with the following severe comment: \"_Ego\r\ntantum confusum Chaos: illic, de plantis legi, nec quicquam didici,\r\nut monstrabo tibi et lapsus et confusionem, alias_.\" The book so\r\ncriticised was the encyclopaedic work edited by Dr John Wilkins, Bishop\r\nof Chester, and published by the Royal Society in 1668, entitled,\r\n\"_An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language_,\"\r\nto which John Ray had contributed the botanical article '_Tables of\r\nPlants_.' This criticism was the beginning of the unfriendly relations\r\nbetween Morison and Ray, of which some further account will be given\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\nAnother point of interest in the _Dialogus_ is the definite assertion\r\n(p. 488) that Ferns are 'perfect' plants, having flower and seed (_quia\r\nhabent flores, qui fugiunt quasi obtutum, et semina quasi pulvisculum\r\nin dorso alarum_), an assertion which was repeated with even greater\r\nemphasis in Morison's preface to his edition of Boccone's _Icones at\r\nDescriptiones Rariorum Plantarum_ etc. (Oxon. 1674), in opposition to\r\nthe views of earlier writers, Cesalpino in particular. Cesalpino had,\r\nit is true, said of the group in which he had placed the Ferns and\r\nother Cryptogams, \"_quod nullum semen molitur_\" (_De Plantis_, p.\r\n591): but he had added, in the same paragraph,--\"_ferunt enim in folio\r\nquid, quod vicem seminis gerit, ut Filix et quae illi affinia sunt_.\"\r\nIt is a question if Morison was much nearer the truth than Cesalpino.\r\n\r\nIt is in the preface of his _Plantarum Umbelliferarum Distributio Nova_\r\n(1672) that Morison first gave a definite statement of the principles\r\nof his method, in the following terms: \"_Cumque methodus sit omnis\r\ndoctrinae anima: idcirco nos tam in hac umbelliferarum dispositione,\r\nquam in universali omnium stirpium digestione, quam pollicemur,\r\nnotas genericas et essentiales a seminibus eorumque similitudine\r\npetitas, per tabulas cognationis et affinitatis disponentes stirpes\r\nexhibebimus. Differentias autem specificas a partibus ignobilioribus,\r\nscilicet radice, foliis et caulibus, odore, sapore, colore desumptas\r\nadscribemus, singulis generibus singulas accersendo species: ita\r\nspecies diversa facie cognoscibiles, sub generibus intermediis: genera\r\nintermedia sub supremis, notis suis essentialibus et semper eodem\r\nmodo sese habentibus distincta militabunt. Hic est ordo a natura ipsa\r\nstirpibus ab initio datus, a me primo jam observatus._\"\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to discuss in detail the merits of Morison's work\r\non the Umbelliferae. It will suffice to say that it was published as a\r\nspecimen of the great Historia that he had in preparation--_trigesimam\r\noperis quod intendimus partem_--so that the learned world might\r\nhave some idea of what they were to expect from the completed work\r\n\"_quemadmodum aiunt ex ungue leonem_\"; and further, that it was the\r\nfirst monograph of a definite group of plants, and is remarkable for\r\nthe sense of relationship between the genera that inspires it. The\r\nUmbelliferae constituted _Sectio IX_ among the fifteen sections in\r\nwhich Morison distributed herbaceous plants.\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1680, appeared the _Pars Secunda_ of the _Plantarum\r\nHistoria Universalis Oxoniensis_ in which work Morison's long-expected\r\nmethod of classification was to be exhibited and justified. However in\r\nthis respect it proved to be disappointing: partly because it was so\r\nlimited in its scope, dealing with but five of his fifteen _Sectiones_\r\nof herbaceous plants: and partly because it did not contain any\r\ncomplete outline of his system. It is most singular that, although he\r\nwrote so much, Morison should have died without having published any\r\nmore definite information concerning his system of classification than\r\nwhat has been here cited.\r\n\r\nMorison's influence did not, however, cease with his death; his\r\ntradition was maintained by the publication in 1699 of the _Pars\r\nTertia_ of the _Historia_, under the editorship of Bobart. This\r\nvolume threw some welcome light upon Morison's system, inasmuch as\r\nit completed the description of the herbaceous plants, and gave a\r\nclear statement, in the form of a _Botanologiae Summarium_, of the\r\nclassification resulting from the application of Morison's principles\r\nto these plants. But, even so, the revelation of the system still\r\nremained incomplete, in the absence of any account of the trees and\r\nshrubs.\r\n\r\nIt was not till nearly forty years after Morison's death, not until\r\nBobart too was dead, that a full statement of Morison's method was\r\npublished. In 1720 there appeared at Oxford a small tract of but twelve\r\npages, the _Historiae Naturalis Sciagraphia_, containing an account of\r\na complete system of classification, which agrees in all essentials,\r\nso far as herbaceous plants are concerned with that adopted by Morison\r\nand by Bobart in their respective volumes of the _Historia_: and, as\r\nregards trees and shrubs, with that in the MS. volume by Bobart which\r\nhas been already mentioned. The tract is anonymous, but the matter that\r\nit contains is Bobart's work, whether it was written by himself or\r\nby some one who had access to his papers. This classification may be\r\naccepted as being essentially that of Morison, though somewhat modified\r\nby Bobart, who had undoubtedly been influenced by Ray's systematic\r\nwritings which had appeared meanwhile. It is of such interest that it\r\nmay be reproduced here, somewhat compressed, with an indication of the\r\nmodern equivalents of the groups.\r\n\r\nI.

The effect of its application\r\nto the Vegetable Kingdom can hardly be accepted as a sufficient\r\njustification of the superlatives with which its author had introduced\r\nit. Of course it is not reasonable to judge this method, or any other\r\nmethod of the past, by the standard of botanical knowledge as at\r\npresent existing: it can only be fairly judged from the standpoint\r\nof its author. What has to be considered is (1) the soundness of the\r\nprinciples adopted, and (2) the consistency in the application of\r\nthose principles. The conclusion to be drawn from such a consideration\r\nof the foregoing table is that Morison was more fortunate in his\r\ntheory than in his practice. In spite of his statement that the\r\n\"_nota generica_\" should be taken from the fructification, many of\r\nthe Sectiones are based upon quite other characters: such are (among\r\nthe Herbs) the Scandentes, the Corymbiferae, the Culmiferae. Had\r\nMorison adhered more closely to his own principles, the results would\r\nhave been more in accordance with his sanguine anticipations: such\r\na heterogeneous group as _Sectio V_, for instance, would have been\r\nimpossible. It was, perhaps, on account of its inconsistency that\r\nMorison's method never came into general use, although it was adopted\r\nenthusiastically by Paul Amman, Professor at Leipzig, in his _Character\r\nPlantarum Naturalis_ (ed. 1685); and, with some modifications, by\r\nChristopher Knaut, Professor at Halle, in his _Enumeratio Plantarum\r\ncirca Halam Saxonum sponte provenientium_, 1687, as well as by Paul\r\nHermann, Professor at Leyden, in his _Florae Lugduno-Batavi Flores_\r\n(ed. Zumbach), 1690.\r\n\r\nMorison's writings evoked severe contemporary criticism, more on\r\naccount of their manner than of their matter. His constant reference\r\nto the \"_Hallucinationes_\" of Caspar Bauhin especially, was considered\r\nto be offensive even if warranted, for every botanist admitted a\r\ndebt of gratitude to the author of the _Pinax_. Equally resented was\r\nMorison's oft-repeated statement that he had drawn the principles of\r\nhis classification, not from the works of other writers, but from the\r\nbook of Nature alone. It was urged against him that he had failed to\r\ndo justice to his predecessors, particularly to Cesalpino: and it must\r\nbe admitted that there is unfortunately some truth in this allegation.\r\nMorison's indebtedness to Cesalpino is suggested by the fact that the\r\nnature of the fruit, and in a secondary degree that of the flower,\r\nwas the basis of both their methods. From a comparison of the two\r\nsystems, as set out in this lecture, their fundamental resemblance can\r\nbe traced through the many differences of detail. Since Morison does\r\nnot quote Cesalpino in his books, it might be inferred that possibly\r\nhe had not read him. But there is convincing evidence to the contrary.\r\nThere is the fact that Morison's preface to the _Historia_ contains a\r\nsentence taken _verbatim_, without acknowledgment, from the dedication\r\nof Cesalpino's _De Plantis_. Further, there is in the Library at\r\nthe Oxford Botanic Garden a copy of the _De Plantis_containing many\r\nmarginal notes which could not have been written by any one but\r\nMorison. The explanation of the position is probably this, that Morison\r\nregarded his classification as so great an advance upon that of\r\nCesalpino, that he did not think it necessary to acknowledge what still\r\nremained of the earlier writer's work: but in any case his omission to\r\nmention Cesalpino was a grave error of judgment.\r\n\r\nAt this point it may well be asked, what are Morison's actual\r\nmerits if, as it appears, he borrowed the leading principles of his\r\nclassification from his predecessors? The most satisfactory answer to\r\nthis question is that which is provided by those who lived and wrote\r\nat times but little removed from his own. Thus Tournefort, in his\r\n_Elemens de Botanique_ (1694: p. 19) speaking of the work of Cesalpino\r\nand of Colonna, said--\"_Peut-être que la chose seroit encore à faire\r\nsi Morison ... ne s'étoit avisé de renouveller cette metode. On ne\r\nsauroit assez louer cet auteur; mais il semble qu'il se loue lui-même\r\nun peu trop: car bien loin de se contenter de la gloire d'avoir executé\r\nune partie du plus beau projet que l'on jamais fait en Botanique, il\r\nose comparer ses découvertes à celles de Cristoffe Colomb, et sans\r\nparler de Gesner, de Cesalpin, ni de Columna, il assure en plusieurs\r\nendroits de ses ouvrages, qu'il n'a rien apris que de la nature même._\"\r\nLater, in his _Institutiones Rei Herbariae_ (1700, p. 53) Tournefort\r\nexpressed the same opinion in somewhat different words:--\"_Legitima\r\nigitur constituendorum generum ratio Gesnero et Columnae tribui debet,\r\neaque fortè in tenebris adhuc jaceret, nisi_ Robertus Morisonus ...\r\n_eam quasi ab Herbariis abalienatam renovasset, instaurasset, et primus\r\nad usus quotidianos adjunxisset, qua in re summis laudibus excipiendus,\r\nlonge vero majoribus si a suis abstinuisset_.\"\r\n\r\nThe estimate formed of him by Linnaeus is clearly stated in a letter\r\naddressed to Haller probably about the year 1737: \"Morison was vain,\r\nyet he cannot be sufficiently praised for having revived system\r\nwhich was half expiring. If you look through Tournefort's genera you\r\nwill readily admit how much he owes to Morison, full as much as\r\nthe latter was indebted to Cesalpino, though Tournefort himself was\r\na conscientious investigator. All that is good in Morison is taken\r\nfrom Cesalpino, from whose guidance he wanders in pursuit of natural\r\naffinities rather than of characters\" (see Smith's _Correspondence of\r\nLinnaeus_, vol. ii. p. 281). If only Morison had frankly assumed the\r\nrole of the restorer of a method that had been forgotten, instead of\r\nposing as its originator, his undoubted merits would have met with\r\ntheir just recognition, and his memory would have been free from any\r\npossible reproach.\r\n\r\nBefore Morison's method of classification could have come into general\r\nuse, there was a rival system in the field, which was destined to\r\nachieve success, and in its course to absorb all that was good in\r\nMorison's: this was the system of John Ray.\r\n\r\nRay was born at Black Notley, near Braintree, Essex, on Nov. 29, 1628;\r\nso that he was not much junior to Morison. He studied and graduated\r\nwith such distinction at the University of Cambridge, that he was\r\nin due course elected a Fellow of, and appointed a Lecturer in, his\r\nCollege (Trinity). Here he remained until 1662, when he resigned his\r\nFellowship on his refusal to sign the declaration against 'the solemn\r\nleague and covenant' prescribed by the Act of Uniformity of 1661. After\r\nleaving Cambridge he spent some years travelling both in Britain and on\r\nthe Continent; and eventually settled at his birth-place, Black Notley,\r\nwhere he died on Jan. 17, 1704-5.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in Cambridge, Ray devoted much of his time to the\r\nstudy of natural history, a study which afterwards became his chief\r\noccupation. The first fruit of his labours in this direction was the\r\n_Catalogus Plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium_, published in 1660,\r\nfollowed in due course by many works, for he was a prolific author,\r\nbotanical and zoological as well as theological and literary, of which\r\nonly those can be considered at present which contributed materially to\r\nthe development of systematic botany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate III_ John Ray (Joannes Rajus)]\r\n\r\nThe first such work of Ray's was his contribution of the _Tables of\r\nPlants_ to Dr John Wilkins's _Real Character and a Philosophical\r\nLanguage_, published in 1669, which has already been mentioned in\r\nthe course of this lecture (p. 21). The following is a summary\r\nof Ray's first attempt at a system of classification. He begins by\r\ndistinguishing Herbs, Shrubs, and Trees. Proceeding to the detailed\r\nclassification of Herbs, he divides them into _Imperfect_ \"which either\r\ndo want or seem to want some of the more essential parts of Plants,\r\nviz. either Root, Stalk, or Seed,\" the Cryptogamia of Linnaeus; and\r\n_Perfect_ \"having all the essential parts belonging to a Plant.\" The\r\nPerfect Herbs are arranged in three main groups according to (1) their\r\nleaves, (2) their flowers, (3) their seed-vessel, each group being\r\nsubdivided in various ways.\r\n\r\n  HERBS CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO THEIR LEAVES:\r\n\r\n  With long Leaves: Frumentaceous, \"such whose seed is used by men for\r\n  food, either Bread, Pudding, Broth, or Drink\" (Cereals): or\r\n  Non-Frumentaceous (other Grasses, Sedges, Reeds).\r\n\r\n    Gramineous Herbs of Bulbous Roots (Bulbous Monocotyledons).\r\n\r\n    Herbs of Affinity to Bulbous Roots (other Monocotyledons).\r\n\r\n  Herbs of Round Leaves (_e.g._ _Petasites_, _Viola_, _Pinguicula_,\r\n                                _Drosera_).\r\n\r\n  Herbs of Nervous Leaves (_e.g._ _Veratrum_, _Plantago_, _Gentiana_,\r\n                                  _Polygonum_).\r\n\r\n  Succulent Herbs (_Sedum_, _Saxifraga_).\r\n\r\n  \"Herbs considered according to the Superficies of their Leaves, or\r\n  their Manner of Growing\":\r\n\r\n      more rough (_e.g._ _Borago_, _Anchusa_, _Echium_):\r\n\r\n      less rough (_e.g._ _Pulmonaria_, _Symphytum_, _Heliotropium_):\r\n\r\n      stellate leaves (_e.g._ _Asparagus_, _Galium_).\r\n\r\n  HERBS CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO THEIR FLOWERS: \"having no seed-vessel\r\n  besides the Cup which covers the flower\":\r\n\r\n  Herbs of Stamineous Flowers, \"whose flower doth consist of threddy\r\n  Filaments or Stamina, having no leaves besides the _Perianthium_: or\r\n  those herbaceous leaves encompassing these stamina, which do not\r\n  wither or fall away before the seed is ripe\"; and not of grassy leaves,\r\n  may be distributed into such whose seeds are\r\n\r\n      Triangular (Polygonaceae);\r\n\r\n      Round: \"distinguishable by sex, of male and female; because from\r\n      the same seed some plants are produced which bear flowers\r\n      and no seeds, and others which bear seeds and no flowers\"\r\n      (_e.g._ _Cannabis_, _Humulus_, _Mercurialis_): not distinguishable\r\n      by sex (_e.g._ Chenopodiaceae, Urticaceæ, Resedaceae).\r\n\r\n  Herbs having a Compound Flower not Pappous }\r\n                                             } (Compositae).\r\n  Pappous Herbs                              }\r\n\r\n  Umbelliferous Herbs (Umbelliferae, with _Valeriana_).\r\n\r\n  Verticillate Fruticose Herbs     }\r\n                                   } (Labiatae).\r\n  Verticillate Not Fruticose Herbs }\r\n\r\n  Spicate Herbs (a curious medley, including _Dipsacus_, _Eryngium_,\r\n  _Echinops_, _Agrimonia_, _Circaea_, _Poterium Sanguisorba_, _Polygonum\r\n  Persicaria_, _Trifolium stellatum_, _T. arvense_, and _Potamogeton\r\n  angustifolium_).\r\n\r\n  Herbs bearing Many Seeds together in a Cluster or Button\r\n  (_e.g._ _Geum_, _Potentilla_, _Anemone_, _Ranunculus_, _Adonis_,\r\n          _Malva_).\r\n\r\n  HERBS CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO THEIR SEED-VESSEL:\r\n\r\n  Of a divided Seed-vessel, which may be called Corniculate (_Paeonia_,\r\n  _Dictamnus_, _Delphinium_, _Aquilegia_, _Aconitum_, _Geranium_,\r\n  _Scandix_).\r\n\r\n  Of an entire Seed-vessel:\r\n\r\n    Siliquous: Papilionaceous Climbing Herbs     }\r\n                                                 } (Papilionaceae).\r\n               Papilionaceous Herbs not Climbing }\r\n\r\n               Not papilionaceous (mostly Cruciferae).\r\n\r\n    Capsulate: bearing Flowers of Five Leaves (Caryophyllaceae,\r\n               Hypericaceae, _Euphorbia_, _Linum_, _Lysimachia_, _Ruta_,\r\n               _Nigella_).\r\n\r\n               whose flowers consist of three or four Leaves (some\r\n               Cruciferae, _Epimedium_, _Papaver_, _Verbena_, _Statice_,\r\n               _Veronica_).\r\n\r\n               Campanulate Herbs:\r\n\r\n                 climbing (most Cucurbitaceae and Convolvulaceae):\r\n\r\n                 erect (Campanulaceae, some Solanaceae, _Digitalis_).\r\n\r\n               Not campanulate (Primulaceae, Scrophulariaceae,\r\n               Acanthaceae, _Aristolochia_, _Vinca_).\r\n\r\n    Bacciferous herbs: may be distinguished according to their Qualities:\r\n\r\n               Esculent fruit: more pleasant (Strawberry),\r\n                               less pleasant (Tomato).\r\n\r\n               Esculent root (Potato):\r\n\r\n               Malignant: of simple leaves (Nightshade, Mandrake),\r\n                          of compound leaves (Herb Christopher, _Paris_).\r\n\r\n    Or Manner of Growth:\r\n\r\n               being climbers (_Bryonia_, _Tamus_, _Smilax_):\r\n\r\n               not climbers (_Physalis Alkekengi_, _Cucubalus_, _Sambucus\r\n                             Ebulus_).\r\n\r\n  OF SHRUBS.\r\n\r\n  I.

Glandiferous and Coniferous Trees (Oak, Alder, Larch, Cedar,\r\n     Pine, Spruce, Cypress).\r\n\r\n  VI. Trees bearing their Seeds in Single Teguments or Coverings\r\n      (Carob, Tamarind, Elm, Hornbeam, Maple, Poplar, Willow,\r\n      Lime, Plane).\r\n\r\n  VII. Trees considered according to their Woods or Barks (Lignum\r\n       Vitae, Snakewood, Sandal-wood, Log-wood, Cinnamon, Cinchona,\r\n       &c.).\r\n\r\n  VIII. Trees considered according to their Gumms or Rosins (Myrrh,\r\n        Gum Arabic, Copal, Benzoin, _Liquidambar_, Camphor).\r\n\r\nSuch is the classification of which Morison spoke so slightingly\r\nin the _Dialogus_: though the character of the leaf is not made so\r\nmuch of as his criticism implied. There is no need to dwell upon the\r\nstrained relations that arose between Ray and Morison; it may suffice\r\nto say that Morison laid himself open to the charge of jealousy, and\r\nthat Ray never forgave the criticisms, both written and oral, that\r\nMorison had made on him. Those who are interested in the unfortunate\r\nquarrel will find an account of it, with a most loyal apology for\r\nMorison, in Blair's _Botanical Essays_ (1720). Ray may certainly be\r\nacquitted of plagiarism which is suggested by Blair, for he had no\r\nopportunity of studying Morison's system in its entirety: since, as\r\nalready explained, it was not published in a complete form until the\r\nappearance of the _Sciagraphia_ in 1720, long after Ray's death. When\r\nRay wrote the _Tables of Plants_ for Dr Wilkins, not even the _Preludia\r\nBotanica_ had been published: the only work that he produced after the\r\npublication of both parts of Morison's _Historia_ was the last edition\r\nof his _Methodus Plantarum_ (1703) which displays principles of\r\nclassification of which Morison had no conception.\r\n\r\nThe _Tables of Plants_ does not illustrate any very definite\r\nprinciples. It was a tentative production, written to order: in\r\nfact, it appears (as explained in the preface to his _Methodus\r\nemendata_, 1703) that Ray, in writing it, was not free to follow what\r\nhe really believed to be the order of Nature. It is interesting,\r\nhowever, as being the first systematic work published in England.\r\nThe classification is based, to some extent, upon the character\r\nof the fruit, a principle borrowed, probably not from Morison but\r\ndirectly from Cesalpino. Before long it was superseded by a much more\r\ncomprehensive and ambitious attempt, the _Methodus Plantarum Nova_,\r\nissued in 1682, two years after Morison's _Historia (Pars Secunda)_.\r\n\r\n=Ray's= _Methodus Plantarum Nova_, 1682.\r\n\r\n  DE HERBIS.\r\n\r\n  Genus        i.

Suffrutiscentes: a miscellaneous collection of species.\r\n\r\nA comparison between the classification of the _Methodus Nova_ and\r\nthat of the _Tables of Plants_ shows that whilst he left the Trees and\r\nthe Shrubs almost unaltered, Ray remodelled his arrangement of the\r\nHerbs. Whereas, in the _Tables_, he had proceeded along three distinct\r\nlines of classification indicated by the characters of leaf, flower,\r\nand seed-vessel respectively, all regarded as equally important;\r\nin the _Methodus_, the leaf-character is subordinated to those of\r\nflower and fruit, and these are not kept distinct but are combined; a\r\nfundamental change of principle which is no doubt to be attributed to\r\nMorison's criticisms on the _Tables_. As Ray put it in his Preface:\r\n_Methodus haec differentias sumit a similitudine et convenientia\r\npartium praecipuarum, radicis puta, floris et ejus calicis, seminis\r\nejusque conceptaculi_. The result is that many of the sub-divisions\r\nconsist of groups of plants which are really natural, the precursors\r\nof several of the recognized Natural Orders of Phanerogams; such as\r\nPolygonaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Compositae, Umbelliferae, Rubiaceae,\r\nBoraginaceae, Labiatae, Cucurbitaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Cruciferae,\r\nLeguminosae, Gramineae. The principles adopted were capable of yielding\r\neven better results, had they been more rigorously applied and had the\r\ninvestigation of the plants been more minute. For instance, in genera\r\nxxi and xxii, with a little more attention to floral characters, the\r\nRanunculaceous might have been separated from the Rosaceous genera,\r\nand all of them from the Malvaceae: similarly in genera xxvi-xxviii,\r\nthe Scrophulariaceous, and possibly also the Campanulaceous genera,\r\nmight have been segregated. One of the principal achievements is the\r\nrecognition of the group Stellatae (Rubiaceae) as independent of, but\r\nrelated to, the Umbelliferae. For this, as well as other features, Ray\r\nwas indebted to Cesalpino (conf. p. 11), as he acknowledges in his\r\nPreface. Nor does Ray fail to acknowledge his obligations to Joachim\r\nJung, and to Morison whose _Preludia_ and _Historia_ he cites.\r\n\r\nBut if Ray's _Methodus Nova_ owed something to Morison's _Historia_\r\n(_Pars secunda_), at a later stage the _Historia_ (_Pars Tertia_) was\r\neven more indebted to the _Methodus Nova_. It is striking to observe\r\nhow many of the groups constituted in the _Pars Tertia_ and in the\r\n_Sciagraphia_ (see p. 23) agree with those of Ray. It is this close\r\nassociation, amounting almost to mutual dependence, of the systems\r\nof these two botanists, that makes comparative criticism of them an\r\nimpossibility. Their relative position may, in fact, be summed up in\r\nthe statement that both of them adopted the principles of Cesalpino,\r\nand that Ray eventually proved to be more successful than Morison in\r\ntheir application.\r\n\r\nThe _Methodus Nova_ is something more than a system of classification.\r\nThe systematic part of the work is preceded by five _Sectiones_\r\nwhich are morphological essays bearing the following titles: I. _De\r\nPlantarum seminibus observationes quaedam generales_: II. _De Foliis\r\nPlantarum seminalibus dictis_: III. _De Plantula seminali reliquisque\r\nsemine contentis_: IV. _De Floribus Plantarum, eorumque partibus\r\net differentiis_: V. _De Divisione Plantarum generali in Arbores,\r\nFrutices, Suffrutices at Herbas_. Beginning with the last, it is\r\na discussion of the propriety of retaining the old Theophrastian\r\nsub-divisions: Ray agreed with Jung (see p. 15) that they are popular\r\nrather than accurate and philosophical, but he retained them on\r\nthe ground of expediency. The fourth _Sectio_ is an outline of the\r\nmorphology of the flower based upon Jung's _Isagoge_ which Ray had\r\nreceived in MS. from Dr John Worthington who had obtained it from\r\nSamuel Hartlib, as is explained in the Preface. The first three\r\n_Sectiones_ are of peculiar interest: they give an account of Ray's\r\nobservations upon seeds and seedlings, with quotations from Malpighi's\r\nrecent work on the same subject (_Anatomes Plantarum_, _Pars Prima_,\r\n1675; _Pars altera_, 1679), recognizing the fact that the seedlings\r\nof some plants have two seed-leaves or cotyledons (as Malpighi first\r\ncalled them), those of others only one, a fact which came to be of\r\ngreat systematic importance.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the _Methodus Nova_ was maintained by Ray in\r\nhis _Historia Plantarum_ (t. i, 1686), as well as in both the first\r\n(1690) and second (1696) editions of his _Synopsis Methodica Stirpium\r\nBritannicarum_, somewhat improved and more compact in form. His\r\nultimate views were expressed in the _Methodus Plantarum emendata et\r\naucta_, published in 1703 not long before his death. In many respects\r\nthis final form of his system is a great improvement upon that of\r\n1682; more especially in the adoption of the number of the seed-leaves\r\nas a systematic character. Ray, it is true, limited the application\r\nof this character to herbaceous plants, as he had not brought\r\nhimself to give up the old categories of Herbs, Shrubs and Trees:\r\nnevertheless, he founded in this work the groups of _Dicotyledones_ and\r\n_Monocotyledones_ which persist, though materially altered as to their\r\ncontent, to the present day.\r\n\r\n=Ray's= _Methodus Emendata et Aucta_, 1703.\r\n\r\n  DE HERBIS.  =Flore Destitutae.=\r\n\r\n  Genus   i.

This, for instance, is\r\nwhat Tournefort said of him (_Elemens de Botanique_, 1694, p. 19):\r\n\"_Monsieur Ray sans faire tant de bruit a beaucoup mieux réussi que\r\nMorison. Sa modestie est louable, et l'Histoire des Plantes qu'il\r\nnous a donnée est une Bibliotheque Botanique, dans laquelle on trouve\r\nnon seulement tout ce que les auteurs ont dit de meilleur sur chaque\r\nplante; mais encore les caracteres des genres y sont designez d'une\r\nmaniere assez commode...._\" In the _Classes Plantarum_ (1738) Linnaeus\r\ngave a somewhat formal approval of Ray's work: \"_Magna sunt opera J.\r\nRaji in Scientia Botanica, qui constantia summa, omnia, quae beneficio\r\nseculi innotuerant de plantis, manu plus quam ferrea descripsit._\" But\r\nperhaps a more genuine opinion is that expressed by Linnaeus in the\r\nletter to Haller from which his estimate of Morison has already been\r\nquoted (see p. 27): \"You are here justly aware, that when the System of\r\nRay was spoken of as perfectly natural, all botanists must have been\r\nblind, unless, like Dillenius, they hoped for a professorship, or were\r\ncompelled, by the authority of the English, to give to Ray supreme\r\nhonours. What was he? Undoubtedly an indefatigable man in collecting,\r\ndescribing, etc.; but in the knowledge of generic principles, less\r\nthan nothing, and altogether deficient in the examination of flowers.\r\nI beg of you to compare the first edition of his _Methodus_ with\r\nthe second and third, where he has learned to take everything from\r\nTournefort. I know not why the discoveries of Caesalpinus have escaped\r\nall observation, whilst everything has stupidly been ascribed to Ray\"\r\n(Smith's _Correspondence of Linnaeus_, ii. p. 280-1). This rather\r\nsevere criticism does not, however, seem to have prejudiced Haller\r\nagainst Ray, for in the former's well-known _Bibliotheca Botanica_\r\n(vol. i. p. 500, 1771), in speaking of the rapid progress of Botany\r\nin the latter part of the seventeenth century, he adds--\"_Multa pars\r\nhorum incrementorum debetur Johanni Ray. Vir pius et modestus, V. D. M.\r\nmaximus ab hominum memoria botanicus, ea felicitate usus est, ut totos\r\nquinquaginta annos dilecto studio ei licuerit impendere._\"\r\n\r\nRay's system also became more popular than that of Morison, and was in\r\ngeneral use in England until the latter half of the eighteenth century,\r\nwhen it was gradually superseded by the Linnean method which was first\r\napplied to English botany in Dr J. Hill's _Flora Britannica_ (1760).\r\n\r\nRay was never engaged in teaching any branch of natural history.\r\nHad there been, in his day, a Chair of Botany in the University\r\nof Cambridge, he would, no doubt, have occupied it: however, the\r\nprofessorship was not established until 1724, twenty years after his\r\ndeath. He might very well have been chosen to succeed Morison at\r\nOxford: but, for some unstated reason, the professorship there was kept\r\nin abeyance for nearly forty years after the death of Morison.\r\n\r\nAs has been explained, Morison and Ray revived the forgotten labours\r\nof Cesalpino. The immediate result of the publication of their systems\r\nwas to stimulate their colleagues on the continent of Europe to a\r\nnoble emulation: there was scarcely a botanist of note who did not\r\nelaborate a system of his own. After suffering from too little work in\r\nthe direction of classification, botany now began to suffer from too\r\nmuch: one after the other, system followed system in rapid succession.\r\nThose, for instance, of Christopher Knaut (1687), Paul Hermann (1690),\r\nBoerhaave (1710), Rivinus (1690-1711), Ruppius (1718), Christian\r\nKnaut (1716): and, in France, of Tournefort (1694, 1700), and of\r\nMagnol (1720). Then came the _Methodus Sexualis_ of Linnaeus (_Systema\r\nNaturae_, 1735). The effect of the general adoption of Linnaeus'\r\nmost useful but artificial method was the temporary arrest almost\r\neverywhere, except in France, of the quest of the natural system.\r\nThough this was the effect of the introduction of his method, it was\r\nnot at all the intention of Linnaeus: for in his _Classes Plantarum_\r\n(1738, p. 485) he said, \"_Primum et ultimum in parte Systematica\r\nBotanices quaesitum est Methodus Naturalis_.\" On the same page of that\r\nwork he laid down, in a series of aphorisms, the principles upon which\r\nalone the construction of such a method can be successfully attempted;\r\nand he gave special emphasis to this one, that the classificatory\r\ncharacters should not be taken from a single structure but from all:\r\n\"_nec una vel altera pars fructificationis, sed solum simplex symmetria\r\nomnium partium_.\" It was just because they had failed to formulate\r\nthis principle that the earlier systematists,--whether Fructists, as\r\nCesalpino, Morison, Ray, Knaut and Hermann; or Corollists, as Rivinus\r\nand Tournefort; or Calycists, as Magnol--were not more successful, and\r\nthat their systems, even the _Methodus emendata_ of Ray, were more or\r\nless artificial.\r\n\r\nIt was in France that the carving out, as it were, of the Natural\r\nOrders from the solid block of genera was carried on with the greatest\r\nsuccess. This process had become much less difficult since Tournefort\r\nhad begun to constitute genera in the modern sense of the term. Before\r\nhis time the word \"genus\" had been applied indiscriminately to every\r\nkind of plant-group (see the systems of Cesalpino and Ray, pp. 12, 32):\r\nthe largest groups were the _summa genera_; the smaller, the _genera\r\nsubalterna_ or _infima_. Tournefort limited the application of the term\r\nto the smallest groups of species, designating by the term _Classe_\r\nthe largest groups which he subdivided into _Sections_ (_Elemens de\r\nBotanique_, 1694). It was Linnaeus (_Classes Plantarum_, p. 485) who\r\nintroduced the term _Ordo_ to designate the subordinate groups of the\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nTournefort himself succeeded, by means of his corollist method, in\r\ndistinguishing for the first time the following _Sections_, describing\r\ntheir flowers by terms which are now familiar as the names of natural\r\norders; _Flore Labiato_, _Cruciformi_, _Rosaceo_, _Caryophyllaceo_,\r\n_Liliaceo_, _Papilionaceo_, _Amentaceo_; though these sections do\r\nnot all exactly agree with the modern Natural Orders of similar\r\ndesignation. A remarkable, if not altogether successful, attempt in\r\nthe same direction was Adanson's _Familles des Plantes_ (1763), based\r\nupon the sound Linnean principle, \"_qu'il ne peut i avoir de Methode\r\nnaturele en Botanicke, que celle qui considere l'ensemble de toutes les\r\nparties des Plantes_.\" The number of species and varieties known in his\r\nday amounted to something over eighteen thousand: these, reduced into\r\n1615 genera, he grouped into fifty-eight families. Several of those had\r\nbeen already more or less well defined; but most of them were entirely\r\noriginal, and not a few of them persist to the present day, though\r\nAdanson is not credited with all that are his due. His lack of method\r\nin naming his families, to say nothing of the fantastic nomenclature\r\nof his genera, made it necessary for other names to be preferred to\r\nhis. Still some familiar names of natural orders are attributable\r\nto him, such as _Hepaticae_, _Onagrae_, _Compositae_, _Caprifolia_,\r\n_Borragines_, _Portulacae_, _Amaranthi_, _Papavera_, _Cisti_, though\r\nmost of them have since undergone some change in their termination. In\r\naddition to these, there are several which would have been credited\r\nto Adanson, had it not so happened that they had also been suggested\r\nby Bernard de Jussieu: such are, _Palmae_, _Aristolochiae_, _Myrti_,\r\n_Campanulae_, _Apocyna_, _Verbenae_, _Thymeleae_, _Gerania_, _Malvae_,\r\n_Ranunculi_. Adanson was the first to publish these names (1763):\r\nbut Bernard de Jussieu had made use of them as early as 1759 in\r\nlaying out the Trianon Garden at Versailles, though they were not\r\nactually published until 1789, when all the 65 orders devised by him\r\nwere included in the _Genera Plantarum secundum Ordines Naturales\r\ndisposita_ of his famous nephew Antoine Laurent de Jussieu. Here at\r\nlast was a fairly complete natural system, consisting of one hundred\r\nnatural orders arranged in fifteen classes, within the three great\r\nsubdivisions, _Acotyledones_, _Monocotyledones_, _Dicotyledones_,\r\nconstituting the framework of that which is accepted at the present\r\nday. It has undergone many modifications, of which the first and\r\nmost important were those effected by A. P. de Candolle (_Théorie\r\nÉlémentaire_, 1813), who, while he improved upon Jussieu in various\r\nways, made the unfortunate, but happily unsuccessful, attempt to\r\nsubstitute \"_Endogenae_\" for \"_Monocotyledones_\" and \"_Exogenae_\" for\r\n\"_Dicotyledones_.\" The system has proved itself capable of expansion to\r\naccommodate all the new genera and natural orders that have since been\r\nestablished: it has justified itself as a natural classification in its\r\nsusceptibility to development in precision as well as in extent, and in\r\nthat it has survived the many experiments made upon it during the first\r\ncentury of its existence.\r\n\r\nThe glory of this crowning achievement belongs to Jussieu: he was the\r\ncapable man who appeared precisely at the psychological moment, and it\r\nis the men that so appear who have made, and will continue to make, all\r\nthe great generalisations of science. Jussieu's achievement, like other\r\ngreat scientific achievements, would have been impossible without the\r\nlabours and failures of his predecessors, of which some account has\r\nbeen given in this lecture. He himself attributed much of his success\r\nto the work of Tournefort, but it is clear that he owed at least as\r\nmuch to Ray: if he learned from the former the systematic importance of\r\nthe gamopetalous and of the polypetalous corolla, he gleaned from the\r\nlatter the value of the cotyledonary characters upon which are based\r\nhis three primary subdivisions of the Vegetable Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary to go beyond the strict limits of the history\r\nof British Botany in order to make it clear to what extent and at\r\nwhat period our two distinguished fellow-countrymen contributed to\r\nthe development of the natural system of classification. Enough has\r\nbeen said to establish the importance and the opportuneness of their\r\ncontributions: if Pisa was glorified by the birth of Systematic Botany,\r\nand Paris by its adolescence, Oxford and Cambridge were honoured by its\r\nrenascence. The question concerning the respective merits of Morison\r\nand Ray finds perhaps its most satisfactory answer in the words of\r\nLinnaeus (_Classes Plantarum_, 1747, p. 65):--\"_Quamprimum Morisonus\r\nartis fundamentum restaurasset, eidem mox suam superstruxit methodum\r\nRajus, quam dein toties reparavit, usque dum in ultima senectute\r\nemendatam et auctam emitteret_\": Morison relaid the foundation upon\r\nwhich Ray built. As Linnaeus points out, Ray enjoyed the advantage of\r\na very long period of productive activity: in the thirty-four years\r\nthat separated his _Tables of Plants_ from his _Methodus Emendata et\r\nAucta_, he had time to revise and remodel his system. Morison, on the\r\ncontrary, was prevented by unfavourable circumstances from beginning\r\nthe publication of his Method until late in life, and he was not\r\npermitted to see more than a fragment of it issue from the press.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Ray was more truly a naturalist than was Morison:\r\nfor in addition to his works on Method, he published not only his\r\n_Catalogus Plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium_ (1660), but\r\nalso a _Catalogus_ of British plants (1670, 2nd ed. 1677), almost\r\nthe earliest work of the kind, only preceded by William How's\r\n_Phytologia Britannica_ (1650), which developed into the first British\r\nFlora arranged systematically, the _Synopsis Methodica Stirpium\r\nBritannicarum_ (1690, 2nd ed. 1696). Morison published nothing on\r\nfield-botany; his volume of the _Historia_ contains, it is true,\r\noccasional mention of plants found in or near Oxford, but the finder\r\nof them seems always to have been the younger Bobart. Ray included in\r\nthe _Synopsis_ a list of plants that had been communicated to him by\r\nBobart, with whom he seems to have been intimate, and expressed his\r\nindebtedness to Bobart's botanical skill.\r\n\r\nBut whether the palm be bestowed upon the one or the other, the fact\r\nremains that both were men of exceptional capacity, and that both did\r\ngood work for British Botany, raising it to a level which commanded\r\nthe respect and admiration of the botanical world; from which, as\r\nthe succeeding lectures of this course will show, it was not allowed\r\nto sink. What Linnaeus said of Morison may be applied equally to\r\nRay,--\"_Roma certe non uno die, nec ab uno condebatur viro. Ille tamen\r\nfaces extinctas incendit, a quibus ignem mutuati sunt subsequentes,\r\nquibus datum ad lucidum magis focum objecta rimare_\" (_Classes\r\nPlantarum_, p. 33).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEHEMIAH GREW\r\n\r\n1641-1712\r\n\r\nBY AGNES ARBER\r\n\r\n  Ancestry and Life narrative--his versatility--state of\r\n  Botany--Grew and Malpighi--Grew's _bona fides_ vindicated--_The\r\n  Anatomy of Vegetables Begun_--seed structure--his treatise on\r\n  the Root--its dedication--_The Anatomy of Trunks_--_The Anatomy\r\n  of Plants_--illustrations--Grew's conception of cells and\r\n  tissues--the plant as a textile fabric--analogy with the animal\r\n  body--medullary rays--secondary thickening--his understanding\r\n  of external morphology--physiological notions--suggestions\r\n  for experiments--importance of the habitat--the sexes of\r\n  flowers--floral and seed structure--estimate of his contributions\r\n  to Botany.\r\n\r\n\r\nNehemiah Grew, who, with the Italian botanist Marcello Malpighi, may\r\nbe considered as co-founder of the science of Plant Anatomy, lived\r\nin stirring and troubled times. His life[2] extended from 1641 to\r\n1712; that is to say, he was born the year before King Charles I\r\nproclaimed war upon the parliamentary forces, and he lived through the\r\nProtectorate, the reigns of Charles II, James II, William and Mary,\r\nand the greater part of the reign of Queen Anne. He came of a stock\r\nremarkable for courage and independence of mind. His grandfather,\r\nFrancis Grew, is described as having been a layman, originally of\r\ngood estate, but \"crush'd\" by prosecutions for non-conformity in\r\nthe High Commission Court and Star Chamber. Francis Grew had a son\r\nObadiah, who was a student of Balliol, and entered the Church. When\r\nthe Civil War broke out, he sided with the parliamentary party, but\r\nwas by no means a blind adherent of Cromwell, with whom he is said\r\nto have pleaded earnestly for the life of King Charles I. In 1662\r\nObadiah Grew resigned his living, being unable to comply with the\r\nAct of Uniformity. Twenty years later, as a man of seventy-five, he\r\nwas convicted of a breach of the Five Mile Act, and imprisoned for six\r\nmonths in Coventry Gaol. But though by this time his sight had failed,\r\nhis spirit was indomitable. Whilst in prison, he dictated a sermon\r\nevery week to an amanuensis, who read it to several shorthand writers,\r\neach of whom undertook a number of copies; it was then distributed to\r\nvarious secret religious meetings, at which it was read. Nehemiah Grew\r\nwas Obadiah's only son, and it is a curious fact that the year 1682,\r\nwhich witnessed the father's imprisonment, was the year in which the\r\nson published his _magnum opus_, _The Anatomy of Plants_, prefaced by\r\nan Epistle Dedicatory to \"His most sacred Majesty Charles II.\" So far\r\nas one can gather, Nehemiah Grew's career seems to have been singularly\r\nunaffected by the political crises that took place around him. The\r\ndeliberate style of his writing certainly suggests a studious and\r\nunruffled life. He was an undergraduate at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge,\r\nand afterwards took his doctor's degree in medicine at Leyden, at the\r\nage of thirty. He seems to have been successful in his profession,\r\nand we learn from the sermon[3] preached at his funeral that he died\r\nsuddenly, whilst still actively engaged in his practice. In the words\r\nof the sermon, \"It was his Honour and Happiness, to be Serviceable to\r\nthe last Moments of Life.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate IV_ NEHEMIAH GREW (1701)\r\n\r\n_Portrait of Nehemiah Grew_ after the portrait by R. White which is\r\nreproduced in the _Cosmologia Sacra_, 1701]\r\n\r\nBefore turning to Grew's botanical work, it may be worth while to\r\nrefer very briefly to his writings on other subjects, showing as they\r\ndo the remarkable versatility of his mind. He produced a series of\r\nchemical papers, and also pamphlets on the method of making sea-water\r\nfresh, and on the nature of the salts present in the Epsom wells. In\r\n1681 appeared his _Musæum Regalis Societatis_, a catalogue raisonné\r\nof the objects in the Museum of the Royal Society, with which were\r\nbound up some contributions to animal anatomy. The Catalogue is a\r\nbulky volume, and it is hard to forbear a smile on reading that Grew\r\ndedicated it to one Colwall, the founder of the Museum, in order that\r\nthe Royal Society \"might always wear this Catalogue, as the Miniature\r\nof [his] abundant Respects, near their Hearts.\" As we should expect,\r\nthis Catalogue is far more discursive than such a work would be if\r\nit were drawn up at the present day, though Grew takes credit to\r\nhimself for not \"medling with Mystick, Mythologick, or Hieroglyphick\r\nmatters.\" He manages, however, to introduce some general remarks which\r\nare of interest. He realises, for instance, that it is possible to\r\ngroup living creatures in a way which has some significance, and that\r\nit is the business of the biologist to discover this grouping. He\r\nblames Aldrovandus for beginning his history of quadrupeds with the\r\nhorse, because it is the most useful animal to man, and points out\r\nthat Gesner's arrangement, which is purely alphabetical, is even less\r\nsatisfactory. \"The very Scale of the Creatures,\" he concludes, \"is a\r\nmatter of high speculation.\" It is tempting to quote largely from the\r\nCatalogue, but I will confine myself to one other remark of Grew's\r\nwhich is perhaps particularly applicable to-day, when the quotation\r\nof authorities is apt to become almost an obsession: \"I have made the\r\nQuotations,\" he says, \"not to prove things well known, to be true; ...\r\nas if _Aristotle_ must be brought to prove a Man hath ten Toes.\"\r\n\r\nGrew's last work was the _Cosmologia Sacra_[4], a folio volume occupied\r\nwith a defence of Christianity, and an explanation of the author's\r\nviews on the nature of the Universe. There is a copy in the British\r\nMuseum, the earlier part of which is crowded with marginal and fly-leaf\r\nnotes, in some cases initialled or even signed in full by Samuel\r\nTaylor Coleridge. One cannot help recalling Charles Lamb's humorous\r\ncomplaint that books lent to Coleridge were apt to be returned \"with\r\nusury; enriched with annotations tripling their value ... in _matter_\r\noftentimes, and almost in _quantity_ not unfrequently, vying with the\r\noriginals.\" Coleridge seems to have accepted Grew quite seriously as a\r\nthinker. In one of his manuscript notes we read, \"It is from admiration\r\nof Dr N. Grew, and my high estimate of his Powers, that I am almost\r\ntempted to say, that the Reasonings in Chapt. III _ought_ to have led\r\nhim to the perception of the _essential phænomenality_ of Matter.\" That\r\nthese reasonings did _not_ so lead him, must, I think, be attributed\r\nto the fact that Grew was above all things a naturalist, and Coleridge\r\na philosopher, and that between the two an intellectual gulf is often\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\nAfter this somewhat lengthy introduction, it is more than time to turn\r\nto our main subject,--the study of Nehemiah Grew's work as a botanist.\r\n\r\nBotanical science was in a decidedly decadent condition when Grew\r\nentered the field. The era of the herbal was closing. The last English\r\nbook of any importance which can strictly be included under this head,\r\nParkinson's _Theatrum Botanicum_, was published the year before Grew\r\nwas born, and a lull in this kind of work followed. It is true that\r\nCulpeper's _Herbal_ appeared later, but this bombastic work was of no\r\nbotanical value. It was reserved for Morison and Ray to open a new\r\nera in British Systematic Botany. At the same time, fresh inspiration\r\nwas being breathed into the science from quite a different quarter.\r\nThe herbalists studied plants primarily with a view to understanding\r\ntheir medicinal properties. Nehemiah Grew also approached Botany in the\r\nfirst instance from the medical standpoint, but it was his knowledge\r\nof anatomy which opened his mind to the possibility of similar work,\r\nwith the bodies of plants, instead of those of animals, as the subject.\r\nHe tells us that he was impressed by the fact that the study of animal\r\nanatomy had been carried on actively from early ages, whereas that\r\nof vegetable anatomy had been scarcely so much as contemplated. \"But\r\nconsidering,\" he continues, \"that both came at first out of the same\r\nHand, and are therefore the Contrivances of the same Wisdom; I thence\r\nfully assured my self, that it could not be a vain Design, though\r\npossibly unsuccessful, to seek it in both.\"\r\n\r\nGrew was drawn to the study of plant structure at the age of\r\ntwenty-three, and seven years later he produced his earliest work on\r\nthe subject, _The Anatomy of Vegetables Begun_, which was published by\r\nthe Royal Society in 1672. It will be remembered that the Royal Society\r\nwas then quite in its youth, its first beginnings only dating back to\r\nabout 1645[5]. By a curious coincidence,--recalling the classic case of\r\nDarwin and Wallace at the Linnean Society,--on the very day that Grew\r\npresented his treatise in print, the Secretary of the Royal Society\r\nreceived Marcello Malpighi's manuscript dealing with the same subject.\r\nPriority can however be fairly claimed for the Englishman, since he\r\nhad submitted his treatise to the Society in manuscript earlier in the\r\nyear. This question of priority, and also the question whether Grew was\r\nguilty of plagiarism from Malpighi's writings, has been much discussed\r\nat different times. Schleiden[6] in particular brought forward charges\r\nof the most serious nature against Nehemiah Grew's good faith.\r\nThese accusations were, however, dealt with in detail in a pamphlet\r\nby Pollender[7] in 1868, and shown to be groundless,--Schleiden's\r\ninformation about the circumstances being wholly inaccurate. There\r\nis now practically no doubt that Grew was an independent worker, and\r\nwas only definitely indebted to Malpighi, in so far as he himself\r\nacknowledges it. In the preface to the second treatise, for instance,\r\nhe mentions the Italian botanist, and remarks in speaking of the\r\n\"Air-vessels\"--\"the manner of their Spiral Conformation (not observable\r\nbut by a Microscope) I first learned from Him, who hath given a very\r\nelegant Description of them.\" If Grew had been a wholesale plunderer\r\nfrom Malpighi's writings, he would scarcely have been likely to have\r\nacknowledged indebtedness on a special point. It must be confessed,\r\nhowever, that judging by present-day standards of scientific etiquette,\r\nGrew should have referred more fully to the works[8] of the Italian\r\nauthor, in his final book, _The Anatomy of Plants_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate V_\r\n\r\nPlate from _Anatomy of Vegetables Begun_, 1672]\r\n\r\n_The Anatomy of Vegetables Begun_ contains more that is of interest\r\nfrom a morphological than from a strictly anatomical standpoint,\r\naccording to the modern sense of the terms. In botanical language, the\r\nmeaning of the word anatomy has become restricted since Grew's time,\r\nuntil it is now often used to denote microscopic detail alone. Grew\r\ndevotes a good deal of space to the study of seed structure, dealing\r\nchiefly with such features as can be observed with the naked eye (Pl.\r\n5). He invented the term \"radicle\" for the embryonic root, and used the\r\nword \"plume\" for the organ which we now speak of in the diminutive as\r\nthe plumule. The cotyledons he called \"lobes,\" but he recognised that\r\nthey might in some cases appear above ground and turn green, becoming\r\nin his terminology \"dissimilar leaves.\" He took the Bean seed as his\r\nprincipal type, and described it with the lucid picturesqueness which\r\nis so characteristic of his writing. It is, he says[9], \"cloathed\r\nwith a double Vest or Coat: These Coats, while the Bean is yet green\r\nare separable and easily distinguished. When 'tis dry, they cleave\r\nso closely together, that the Eye, not before instructed, will judge\r\nthem but one; the inner Coat likewise (which is of the most rare\r\ncontexture) so far shrinking up, as to seem only the roughness of the\r\nouter, somewhat resembling Wafers under _Maquaroons_. At the thicker\r\nend of the Bean, in the outer Coat, a very small _Foramen_ presents it\r\nself: ... That this _Foramen_ is truly permeable even in old setting\r\n_Beans_, appears upon their being soak'd for some time in Water: For\r\nthen taking them out, and crushing them a little, many small Bubbles\r\nwill alternately rise and break upon it.\"... The _Plume_ \"is not, like\r\nthe _Radicle_, an entire Body, but divided at its loose end into divers\r\npieces, all very close set together, as Feathers in a Bunch; for which\r\nreason it may be called the _Plume_. They are so close, that only two\r\nor three of the outmost are at first seen: but upon a nice and curious\r\nseparation of these, the more interiour still may be discovered....\r\nIn a French Bean the two outmost are very fair and elegant. In the\r\ngreat Garden-Bean, two extraordinary small Plumes, often, if not\r\nalways, stand one on either side the great one now describ'd.\" These\r\ntwo \"extraordinary small plumes\" are, in other words, the structures\r\nwhich we should now describe as buds in the axils of the cotyledons.\r\nGrew also notices that two simplified leaves are borne next above the\r\ncotyledons, or, as he expresses it, the \"Plume\" is \"cooped up betwixt a\r\npair of Surfoyls.\"\r\n\r\nGrew deals also with the vernation of leaves, and methods of bud\r\nprotection. He shews that their position and folding gives \"two general\r\nadvantages to the Leaves, Elegance and Security, sc. in taking up,\r\nso far as their Forms will bear, the least room; and in being so\r\nconveniently couch'd, as to be capable of receiving protection from\r\nother parts, or of giving it to one another; as for instance, First,\r\nThere is the _Plain-Lap_, where the Leaves are all laid somewhat\r\nconvexly one over another, but not plaited; being to the length,\r\nbreadth and number of Leaves most agreeable; as in the Buds of\r\n_Pear-tree_, _Plum-tree_, etc. But where the Leaves are not thick set,\r\nas to stand in the _Plain-lap_, there we have the _Plicature_; as in\r\n_Rose-tree_, _Strawberry_, _Cinquefoyl_, _Burnet_ etc.\" Grew refers\r\nalso to rolled vernation, distinguishing between the \"Fore-Rowl\" and\r\nthe \"Back-Rowl.\" He thus remarks on the hairy covering characteristic\r\nof young leaves:--\"the _Hairs_ being then in form of a _Down_, alwayes\r\nvery thick set, thus give that protection to the Leaves, which their\r\nexceeding tenderness then requires; so that they seem to be vested with\r\na Coat of _Frieze_, or to be kept warm like young and dainty Chickens,\r\nin Wooll.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year following the publication of _The Anatomy of Vegetables\r\nBegun_, Nehemiah Grew produced a second treatise, under the title,\r\n\"An Idea of a Phytological History Propounded. Together with a\r\nContinuation of the Anatomy of Vegetables; Particularly prosecuted\r\nupon Roots. And an Account of the Vegetation of Roots Grounded chiefly\r\nthereupon.\" In the dedications of his books Grew often reveals much\r\nof his own personality, and of his attitude towards science, although\r\nsuch revelations are apt to be mingled with the curious \"conceits,\"\r\nand extravagant flattery, characteristic of the time. For instance he\r\ndedicated this particular work to the President and Fellows of the\r\nRoyal Society, and after addressing to them some apologetic remarks\r\nabout his own performance, he takes heart of grace from the thought\r\nthat \"how unpromising soever the Stock may be, yet the Fruit cannot\r\nbut be somewhat matured upon which You are pleas'd to shine.\" It\r\nshews how strong the influence of fashion can be, when we find such\r\nbombast coming from the pen of a man who, only a few lines earlier,\r\nhas written, with the perfection of simplicity, \"Withal, I looked upon\r\nNature as a Treasure so infinitely full, that as all men together\r\ncannot exhaust it; so no man, but may find out somewhat therein, if he\r\nbe resolved to try.\"\r\n\r\nThe most important part of this treatise is the account of the\r\ncomparative structure of roots, to which we will return later, when\r\ndiscussing Grew's anatomical conceptions. With regard to the position\r\nof the plant in the soil, he held somewhat mystical views. He believed\r\nthat the \"air-vessels\" or tracheal elements, tended to draw the plant\r\nupwards, and the roots to pull it downwards. He says, for example, that\r\nthe upper part of the roots of most seedlings ascend, because the first\r\nleaves being large and standing in the open air, \"the _Air-vessels_ in\r\nthem have a dominion over the young _Root_, and so yielding themselves\r\nto the sollicitation of the _Air upwards_, draw the _Root_ in part\r\nafter them.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1675 appeared Grew's third botanical work, _The Comparative Anatomy\r\nof Trunks_, which dealt with stem structure, as the previous work dealt\r\nwith root structure. There is, in the British Museum, a particularly\r\ninteresting copy of this book, which is elaborately annotated in\r\nmanuscript. From internal evidence it seems almost certain that this\r\nis the author's copy, corrected in his own handwriting[10]. Some,\r\nthough not by any means all, of the corrections are identical with the\r\nalterations found in the 1682 edition. Above the first plate is written\r\n\"vide ye Book Interleavd,\" and we may perhaps hazard the guess that\r\nin this copy we have Grew's first suggestions, whilst those which he\r\nfinally adopted in the second edition were inserted in the interleaved\r\ncopy whose whereabouts, if it still exists, is unknown at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nPl. 6 shews a typical page from the annotated copy. At the foot\r\nwe find the note \"Air-Vessels out of Parenchyma, transformed, as\r\nCaterpillars to Flys,\" shewing that Grew had arrived at some idea\r\nof the formation of vessels. The whole section of the book to which\r\nthis page belongs is very much remodelled in the 1682 edition, but\r\nthe analogy just quoted is introduced and Grew proceeds accurately\r\nto describe the origin of vessels. \"And as the _Pith_ it self, by\r\nthe Rupture and Shrinking up of several _Rows_ of _Bladders_, doth\r\noftentimes become Tubulary: So is it also probable, that in the other\r\n_Parenchymous Parts_, one single _Row_ or _File_ of _Bladders_ evenly\r\nand perpendicularly piled; may sometimes, by the shrinking up of their\r\nHorizontal _Fibres_, all regularly breakone [sic] into another and so\r\nmake one _continued Cavity_.\"\r\n\r\nI have passed over these three treatises in a somewhat cursory fashion,\r\nbecause Nehemiah Grew's botanical work is perhaps better studied in\r\nhis final pronouncement on the subject,--a folio volume published\r\nin 1682 under the title of \"The Anatomy of Plants. With an Idea of\r\na Philosophical History of Plants. And several other Lectures, Read\r\nbefore the Royal Society.\" This work consists of second editions of\r\nhis three earlier treatises, largely rewritten, with a great deal of\r\nadditional matter, including a section on the anatomy of flowers, and\r\nmany new figures. Some of the plates are excellent, and especially\r\nremarkable for the way in which Grew shews the anatomy in drawings\r\nwhich represent the organ in three dimensions (Pl. 7). He himself\r\nlaid great stress on this. In his own words, \"In the _Plates_, for\r\nthe clearer conception of the _Part_ described, I have represented\r\nit, generally, as entire, as its being magnified to some good degree,\r\nwould bear.... So, for instance, not the _Barque_, _Wood_, or _Pith_\r\nof a _Root_ or _Tree_, by it self; but at least, some portion of all\r\nthree together: Whereby, both their _Texture_, and also their Relation\r\none to another, and the _Fabrick_ of the whole, may be observed at one\r\n_View_.\" One cannot help wishing that botanists of the present day\r\nwould more often take the trouble to illustrate their papers on this\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate VI_\r\n\r\nA page from _The Comparative Anatomy of Trunks_, Nehemiah Grew, 1675.\r\nThe annotations are believed to be in the author's own handwriting.\r\n[British Museum. Printed Books Dept. (_972.a.10_)]]\r\n\r\nIt is as a plant anatomist that Grew is chiefly famous, and it is\r\nimportant to try to realise exactly how far his conception of the\r\nanatomical structure of plants has been confirmed by more recent\r\nresearch. In appraising his work it must be remembered that he\r\nwas essentially the pioneer of the science. It is true that some\r\nobservations on plant anatomy occur in Robert Hooke's _Micrographia_,\r\nwhich was published six years before Grew sent in his first manuscript\r\nto the Royal Society; but Hooke never really attempted to make a\r\nsystematic study of the subject. He had succeeded in greatly improving\r\nthe microscope, and his chief interest was in applying his instrument\r\nto all kinds of bodies, vegetable and otherwise. Cork, charcoal, pith,\r\netc., came under his observation, and to some extent he understood\r\ntheir structure. Grew acknowledges indebtedness to \"the Learned and\r\nmost Ingenious Naturalist M^r _Hook_,\" and tells us that some of the\r\nresults which Hooke obtained, inspired him to study certain of his\r\nplants again with a better microscope. For instance Hooke was able\r\nto see smaller pores in wood than Grew had been able to detect, but,\r\nwith better glasses, he confirmed the accuracy of Hooke's observation.\r\nHowever, although Hooke must certainly be credited with priority in\r\nthe discovery of the fact that plant tissues are characterised by a\r\ncellular structure, his botanical work, considered in its entirety, is\r\nof very slight significance compared with that of Grew.\r\n\r\nGrew's clearest account of plant cells is perhaps to be found in his\r\ndescription of root parenchyma, which he compares to \"the Froth of\r\n_Beer_ or _Eggs_\" or to \"a fine piece of _Manchet_[11],\" or again, to\r\n\"a most curious and exquisitely fine-wrought Sponge.\" He quotes with\r\napproval Hooke's description of _Elder-Pith_ as \"an heap of _Bubbles_.\"\r\nIt would be unsafe however to conclude that he had really arrived at\r\nwhat is known as the Cell Theory. His conception of the nature of\r\nplant tissues was not by any means that of the modern botanist. He\r\nbelieved the cell-walls to consist of inter-woven fibres, which were\r\ncontinuous from cell to cell. He did not consider that these fibres\r\nwere invariably wrought together in such a fashion as to enclose\r\nbladder-like spaces, or cells; in some cases he held that the tissue\r\nwas non-cellular, consisting simply of interwoven fibres. It was these\r\nhypothetical fibres, rather than the cells, which he regarded as\r\nof fundamental importance. His idea, which is somewhat confusing, is\r\nperhaps best understood from his comparison of plant structure with\r\npillow lace. The \"most unfeigned and proper resemblance we can,\" he\r\nwrites, \"at present make of the whole _Body_ of a _Plant_, is, To a\r\npiece of _fine Bone-Lace_, when the Women are working it upon the\r\n_Cushion_, For the _Pith_, _Insertions_[12], and _Parenchyma_ of the\r\n_Barque_, are all extream Fine and Perfect _Lace-Work_: the _Fibres_\r\nof the _Pith_ running _Horizontally_, as do the _Threds_ in a Piece of\r\n_Lace_; and bounding the several _Bladders_ of the _Pith_ and _Barque_,\r\nas the _Threds_ do the several _Holes_ of the _Lace_; and making up the\r\n_Insertions_ without _Bladders_, or with very small ones, as the same\r\n_Threds_ likewise do the _close_ Parts of the _Lace_, which they call\r\nthe _Cloth-Work_. And lastly, both the _Lignous_ and _Aer-Vessels_,\r\nstand all _Perpendicular_, and so cross to the _Horizontal Fibres_ of\r\nall the said _Parenchymous Parts_; even as in a Piece of _Lace_ upon\r\nthe _Cushion_, the _Pins_ do to the _Threds_. The _Pins_ being also\r\nconceived to be _Tubular_, and prolonged to any length; and the same\r\n_Lace-Work_ to be wrought many Thousands of times over and over again,\r\nto any thickness or hight, according to the hight of any _Plant_. And\r\nthis is the true _Texture_ of a _Plant_.\"\r\n\r\nGrew thus visualised the inner structure of the plant as a textile\r\nfabric, and the analogy between vegetable substance and woven threads\r\nseems to have been constantly present in his mind. The same idea also\r\noccurs, for instance, in the dedication of his _magnum opus_, where he\r\nsays, \"one who walks about with the meanest _Stick_, holds a Piece of\r\nNature's Handicraft, which far surpasses the most elaborate _Woof_ or\r\n_Needle-Work_ in the World.\"\r\n\r\nThe notions at which Nehemiah Grew arrived on the subject of the\r\nvascular anatomy of plants were more advanced than his ideas on the\r\nultimate nature of the tissues. There is no doubt that the comparison\r\nwith animal anatomy, which was constantly in his mind, was on the whole\r\nhelpful, though it led to some errors. The following paragraph, which\r\noccurs in the _Cosmologia Sacra_, seems to be an instance in which the\r\nanalogy with the animal kingdom, helped him to take a broad view. \"In\r\nthe Woody Parts of Plants, which are their Bones; the Principles are so\r\ncompounded, as to make them Flexible without Joynts, and also Elastick.\r\nThat so their Roots may yield to Stones, and their Trunks to the Wind,\r\nor other force, with a power of Restitution. Whereas the Bones of\r\nAnimals, being joynted, are made Inflexible.\"\r\n\r\nIn plants, as in animals, Grew looked for \"vessels,\" and discovered\r\nby means of a simple experiment that continuous tubes, worthy of\r\nbeing called by this name, existed in the outer parts of the root,\r\nwhereas the pith consisted of closed chambers. He cut a fresh root\r\ntransversely, and then gently pressed the side of it with his finger\r\nnail. He was able to detect the vessels with the naked eye, and he\r\nobserved that where they occurred, sap oozed out under pressure, but\r\nwas sucked in again when the pressure was removed. The pressure also\r\nexpressed a certain amount of sap from the pith, where vessels were\r\nabsent, but here the sap was not sucked in again when the root was no\r\nlonger squeezed, shewing that the liquid had only been forced out by\r\nthe wounding of the cells. Had they been open tubes like the vessels,\r\nthe release of the pressure would have caused the sap to disappear.\r\nGrew recognised that the vascular tissue of the root is centrally\r\nplaced, whereas in the stem it is circumferential, and he points out\r\nthat this difference is connected with the diverse mechanical needs\r\nof the two organs. It should also be noted that he discovered that\r\nconcentration of the vascular system is characteristic of climbing\r\nplants, the wood, in his own words, standing \"more close and round\r\ntogether in or near the Center, thereby making a round, and slender\r\n_Trunk_. To the end, it may be more tractable, to the power of the\r\nexternal _Motor_, what ever that may be: and also more secure from\r\nbreaking by its winding _Motion_.\" He observed the radial arrangement\r\nof the xylem in the root, and offered an explanation of it, which\r\nis however scarcely free from obscurity. \"Some of the more Æthereal\r\nand Subtile parts of the _Aer_, as they stream through the _Root_,\r\nit should seem, by a certain _Magnetisme_, do gradually dispose the\r\n_Aer-Vessels_, where there are any store of them, into _Rays_.\" Amongst\r\nother details of root anatomy, Grew discovered that all the tissues\r\noutside the central cylinder sometimes peel off when the root becomes\r\nold, or as he says, \"the whole body of the Perpendicular _Roots_,\r\nexcept the woody _Fibre_ in the Centre, becomes the second _skin_.\"\r\nTurning to stem structure, we find that he understood the difference\r\nin origin between stem buds and adventitious roots. The stem bud, he\r\nwrites, \"carries along with it, some portion of every _Part_ in the\r\n_Trunk_ or _Stalk_; whereof it is a _Compendium_.\" The adventitious\r\nroot, on the other hand, \"always shoots forth, by making a Rupture in\r\nthe _Barque_, which it leaves behind, and proceeds only from the inner\r\npart of the _Stalk_.\" He describes the vascular bundles of the stem\r\nas \"fibres\" perforated by numerous \"pores.\" It would be a mistake,\r\nhowever, to suppose that he had no understanding of their structure, at\r\nleast as regards the xylem, for he goes on to say that \"each _Fibre_,\r\nthough it seem to the bare eye to be but _one_, yet is, indeed, a\r\ngreat number of _Fibres_ together; and every _Pore_, being not meerly\r\na space betwixt the several parts of the Wood, but the _Concave_ of\r\na _Fiber_.\" He noticed the medullary rays, for which he uses the\r\nexpressive term \"Insertions.\" \"These _Insertions_,\" he says, \"are\r\nlikewise very conspicuous in Sawing of _Trees_ length-ways into Boards,\r\nand those plain'd, and wrought into _Leaves_ for _Tables_, _Wainscot_,\r\n_Trenchers_, and the like. In all which, ... there are many parts which\r\nhave a greater smoothness than the rest; and are so many _inserted\r\nPieces_ of the _Cortical Body_; which being by those of the _Lignous_,\r\nfrequently intercepted, seem to be discontinuous, although in the\r\n_Trunk_ they are really extended, in continued Plates, throughout its\r\nBreadth.\"\r\n\r\nNehemiah Grew was interested in the process of secondary thickening,\r\nbut he only arrived at a dim notion of how it took place. He grasped,\r\nhowever, the important point that in a tree trunk the meristematic\r\nzone lies near the surface, \"the young _Vessels_ and _Parenchymous\r\nParts_\" being formed annually \"betwixt the _Wood_ and _Barque_.\" He\r\ndescribes how, \"every year, the _Barque_ of a _Tree_ is divided into\r\nTwo Parts, and distributed two _contrary_ ways. The outer Part falleth\r\noff towards the _Skin_; and at length becomes the _Skin_ it self....\r\nThe inmost portion of the _Barque_, is annually distributed and added\r\nto the _Wood_; the _Parenchymous Part_ thereof making a new addition\r\nto the _Insertions_ within the _Wood_; and the _Lymphæducts_ a new\r\naddition to the _Lignous pieces_ betwixt which the _Insertions_ stand.\r\nSo that a _Ring_ of _Lymphæducts_ in the _Barque_ this year, will be a\r\n_Ring_ of _Wood_ the next; and so another _Ring_ of _Lymphæducts_, and\r\nof _Wood_, successively, from year to year.\" Exactly what Grew meant\r\nby the term \"Lymphæduct\" is not always clear. In some cases he seems\r\nto refer to the phloem and cambium by this name, and in other cases to\r\nthe perimedullary zone. The annual rings in Oak, Elm, Ash, etc. came\r\nunder his observation, and he remarks that the difference between the\r\nSpring and Autumn wood, as we should now call it, arises from the fact\r\nthat \"the _Aer-Vessels_ that stand in the inner _margin_ of each annual\r\n_Ring_, are all vastly bigger, than any of those that stand in the\r\nouter part of the _Ring_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate VII_\r\n\r\nFrom Grew's _Anatomy_\r\n\r\nSheweth the Parts of a Goosberry\r\n\r\nPart of a Vine Branch cut transversly, and splitt half way downe y^e\r\nmidle]\r\n\r\nGrew did not enter into the minuter details of histology, except in\r\nhis description of the spiral tracheids, to which, as we have seen,\r\nhis attention was first called by Malpighi's observations. He speaks\r\nof the spiral as formed of \"Two or More round and true _Fibres_,\r\nalthough standing collaterally together, yet perfectly distinct.\r\nNeither are these Single _Fibres_ themselves _flat_, like a _Zone_; but\r\nof a _round_ forme, like a most fine _Thred_.\" He makes the curious\r\nstatement that the direction of the spiral is constant, being \"in\r\nthe _Root_, by _South_, from _West_ to _East_: but in the _Trunk_,\r\ncontrarily, by _South_, from _East_ to _West_.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough it is as an anatomist that Nehemiah Grew is best known, his\r\ngrasp of external morphology is perhaps even more remarkable. His work\r\non seed structure has already been quoted. He seems to have quite\r\nreadily detected the true nature of modified stems. He examined for\r\ninstance the thorns of the Hawthorn, and saw that their structure\r\nwas axial. In his own words, they \"are constituted of all the same\r\nsubstantial _Parts_ whereof the _Germen_ or _Bud_ it self [is], and\r\nin a like proportion: which also in their Infancy are set with the\r\nresemblances of divers minute _Leaves_.\" It should be recalled that\r\nAlbertus Magnus, the great scholastic philosopher, writing in the\r\nthirteenth century, distinguished between thorns and prickles, and\r\nnoticed transitions between the former and leafy branches[13]. There\r\nis no reason to suppose, however, that our author was acquainted with\r\nthe work of Albertus. Grew realised the nature of Bulbs, and points out\r\nthat \"the _Strings_ only, are absolute _Roots_; the _Bulb_, actually\r\ncontaining those _Parts_, which springing up, make the _Leaves_ or\r\n_Body_; and is, as it were, a Great _Bud_ under ground.\"\r\n\r\nNehemiah Grew was interested in plant physiology, although the state\r\nof chemical and physical knowledge at the time did not allow of his\r\nadvancing so far in this, as in the morphological side of the subject.\r\nHis turn of mind, too, appears to have naturally led him to the study\r\nof form rather than that of function. As regards the absorption of\r\nwater, his idea was simply that the roots sucked up water like a\r\nsponge, because the parenchyma was of a spongy nature. He supposed\r\nthat the liquid was rendered purer by being strained through the skin,\r\nwhich, according to whether it was of a texture resembling brown\r\npaper, cotton, or leather, would produce a different effect upon\r\nany solution passing through it. His explanation of the ascent of\r\nthe sap had really much in common with the \"Kletterbewegung\" theory\r\npropounded by Westermaier[14] almost exactly two hundred years later.\r\nGrew argued that \"considering to what height and plenty, the _Sap_\r\nsometimes ascends; it is not intelligible, how it should thus ascend,\r\nby virtue of any one _Part_ of a _Plant_, alone; that is neither by\r\nvirtue of the _Parenchyma_, nor by virtue of the _Vessels_, alone.\"\r\nHe pointed out that the parenchyma might suck up a liquid for a short\r\ndistance, and also the vessels, like \"small _Glass-Pipes_ immersed in\r\nWater, will give it an ascent for some Inches; yet there is a certain\r\n_period_, according to the _bore_ of the _Pipe_, beyond which it will\r\nnot rise.\" To account for the rise he supposes that the vessels and\r\nparenchyma work together, the turgidity of the surrounding parenchyma\r\ncells both compressing the vessels, and thus causing the liquid in them\r\nto ascend, and also actually forcing some of their own contents into\r\nthem. Grew performed a few experiments, especially in the direction of\r\nplant chemistry. This was a natural line of work for a doctor, since\r\nthe extraction of various vegetable substances had long been practised\r\nin medicine. He noticed, amongst other points, that the green infusion\r\nobtained by treating a plant with olive oil would, at least in the\r\ncase of certain aromatic plants, appear of a green colour in a small\r\ndrop, but of a red, or deep yellow, when a quantity of it was held\r\nup against a candle. In other words, Grew seems to have observed the\r\ncharacteristic fluorescence of chlorophyll.\r\n\r\nHe was interested also in the subject of geotropism, and succeeded in\r\nproving that there is an innate tendency for the root to grow down\r\nand the stem to grow up; and that it is not merely a case of the root\r\nseeking the soil, and the stem the air. His directions for performing\r\nthe experiment are as follows:--\"Take a Box of _Moulds_, with a hole\r\nbored in the bottom, wide enough to admit the _Stalk_ of a _Plant_,\r\nand set it upon stilts half a yard or more above ground. Then lodg in\r\nthe _Mould_ some _Plant_, for Example a _Bean_, in such sort, that\r\nthe _Root_ of the _Bean_ standing in the _Moulds_ may poynt upwards,\r\nthe _Stalk_ towards the ground. As the _Plant_ grows, it will follow,\r\nthat at length the _Stalk_ will rise upward, and the _Root_ on the\r\ncontrary, arch it self downward. Which evidently shews, That it is\r\nnot sufficient, that the _Root_ hath _Earth_ to shoot into, or that\r\nits _Motion_ is only an _Appetite_ of being therein lodged, which way\r\nsoever that be: but that its nature is, though within the _Earth_\r\nalready, yet to change its _Position_, and to _move Downwards_. And so\r\nlikewise of the _Trunk_, that it rises, when a _Seed_ sprouts, out of\r\nthe Ground, not meerly because it hath an _Appetite_ of being in the\r\nopen _Aer_; for in this Experiment it is so already; yet now makes a\r\nnew _Motion_ upwards.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Grew cannot be called a great experimenter, he frequently\r\ntook the easier course of throwing out suggestions for such work.\r\n\"The generation of Experiments\" he describes as \"being like that\r\nof Discourse, where one thing introduceth an hundred more which\r\notherwise would never have been thought of.\" Amongst other proposals\r\nhe recommends that trial should be made of growing plants in common\r\nwater, snow water, milk, oil, wine, ink, etc., or in any of these with\r\nsolid bodies, such as nitre and salt, dissolved in them. He points out\r\nthat the effect both on the plant and on the liquid should be noted.\r\nThe solid body should be weighed before solution, and then, after the\r\nexperiment is over, the liquid should be evaporated and the solid again\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\nAnother instance in which he suggested an experiment, apparently\r\nwithout carrying it out, was in relation to the movements of the stems\r\nof non-climbing plants. He seems to have anticipated the nineteenth\r\ncentury discovery of nutation amongst plants other than climbers,\r\nthough he stopped short of actually proving it. In his account of the\r\nMotions of Trunks he remarks, \"The _Convolution_ of _Plants_, hath been\r\nobserved only in those that Climb. But it seems probable, that many\r\nothers do also _wind_; ... Whether it be so, or not the Experiment\r\nmay easily be made by tying a _Thred_ upon any of the _Branches_;\r\nsetting down the respect it then hath to any Quarter in the _Heavens_:\r\nfor, if it shall appear in two or three Months, to have changed its\r\nSituation towards some other Quarter; it is certain proof hereof.\" He\r\nnoticed that some plants twine \"by _South_ from _East_ to _West_\" and\r\nothers \"from _West_ to _East_,\" and attributed this to their being\r\nrespectively under the influence of the sun and the moon.\r\n\r\nWhenever Grew's notions of plant physiology depended upon chemistry,\r\nthey became, according to our modern ideas, extremely difficult to\r\nfollow. He held, among many other curious beliefs, that salts obtained\r\nfrom any plant have a tendency to crystallise out in a form resembling\r\nthat plant, and adds, as an illustration from the animal world, \"though\r\nI have not seen it my self, yet I have been told by one that doth not\r\nuse to phancy things, that the Volatile Salt of _Vipers_, will figure\r\nit self into the semblance of little _Vipers_.\"\r\n\r\nThe mystical belief that characteristic \"principles\" permeate all\r\nthings, finds expression in his idea that the \"frost flowers,\"\r\nsometimes to be seen on a window pane, are evidence that the air\r\nis impregnated with \"_Vegetable Principles_.\" Another fact, which\r\nhe brings forward in support of the same view, is that the ground\r\nor water, when exposed for some time to air, turns green. His\r\nexplanation, in this latter case, was not far from the truth, for, as\r\nwe now know, the greenness is due to the vegetation of minute algæ,\r\nwhich, in their dormant state, may be carried from place to place by\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to regard Ecology as a very recent development of botanical\r\nscience, but Nehemiah Grew seems to have been alive to the importance\r\nof the ecological standpoint,--though he did not describe it by this\r\nname. He writes \"The proper _Places_ also of _Plants_, or such wherein\r\nthey have ... a Spontaneous growth, should be considered. And that as\r\nto the _Climate_; whether in one Colder, Temperate, or more Hot. The\r\n_Region_; Continent, or Island. The _Seat_; as Sea, or Land, Watry,\r\nBoggy, or Dry; Hills, Plains, or Vallies; Open, in Woods, or under\r\nHedges; against _Walls_, rooted in them, or on their Tops; and the\r\nlike.\"\r\n\r\nGrew's most interesting contribution to science was, perhaps, his\r\npublication of the fact that the flowering plants, like animals,\r\nshew the phenomena of sex. He never, however, actually proved this\r\ncontention in an experimental way. At the time that his earliest\r\nwork[15] was published, he was frankly puzzled by the stamens, or,\r\nas he calls them, the \"Attire.\" He recognised their use to insects,\r\nto whom flowers serve, in his own words, as \"their Lodging and their\r\nDining-Room.\" He also fully realised their value to man as increasing\r\nthe beauty of the blossom, but he was broad-minded enough to feel that\r\nthese must be secondary uses, and that \"the primary and private use\r\nof the _attire_\" remained to be discovered. Ten years later, in the\r\nsecond edition of his work, he tells us that it was suggested to him in\r\nconversation by Sir Thomas Millington that the stamens were the male\r\norgans. It seems probable that, although Grew gives Millington the\r\ncredit for this discovery, he had really arrived at it independently,\r\nfor he tells us that when Millington made the suggestion, he\r\n\"immediately reply'd that [he] was of the same Opinion; and gave him\r\nsome reasons for it, and answered some _Objections_, which might oppose\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nBesides his belief in the male nature of the stamen, Nehemiah Grew\r\ncame to some rather mysterious conclusions as to their serving to\r\ndraw off the redundant part of the sap, not needed to produce the\r\nseed. He also used the word \"attire\" for the florets of the Compositæ,\r\nbut qualified it by calling the stamens the \"seminal attire,\" and the\r\nflorets of compound flowers the \"florid attire.\" He says that \"every\r\n_Flower_ with the _Florid attire_\" (or, as we should now say, \"every\r\ncomposite flower\") \"Embosomes, or is, a _Posy_ of perfect _Flowers_.\"\r\nHe recognised the \"globulets\" (pollen grains) as being of the same\r\nnature as those in the anthers of simple flowers. He describes the disk\r\nflorets with remarkable accuracy, but falls into the error of supposing\r\nthat the pollen grains are in some cases originally produced by the\r\nstyle and stigmas, which he calls the \"Blade,\" and which he did not\r\nrecognise as part of the female organ. His figures make it clear that\r\nhe mistook the stylar hairs for little stalks organically connecting\r\nthe pollen grains and the style. In other cases, however, he observed\r\nthat the pollen grains occurred on the inner side of what we now know\r\nas the staminal tube.\r\n\r\nGrew enters into considerable detail as regards the structure of\r\nflowers, and it is only possible to mention here a few of the points\r\nto which he draws attention. He observed the frequent occurrence of\r\ncapitate glandular hairs, which he describes as \"like so many little\r\n_Mushrooms_ sprouting out of the _Flower_,\" their heads sometimes\r\nexuding a \"_Gummy_ or _Balsamick Juyce_.\" He describes the varieties\r\nof aestivation of the floral leaves, and notes that, in the Poppy,\r\nthe large size and fewness of the petals prevents their being folded\r\ninto a compact body by any of the ordinary methods. \"For which reason,\r\nthey are cramb'd up within the _Empalement_[16] by hundreds of\r\nlittle _Wrinckles_ or _Puckers_; as if Three or Four Fine _Cambrick\r\nHandcherchifs_ were thrust into ones _Pocket_.\"\r\n\r\nWe have said something about Grew's work on seeds, in dealing with his\r\nfirst treatise. He was always much interested in this subject, and\r\nreturned to it again in his later work. He mentions the mucilaginous\r\ntesta possessed by many seeds, but which only becomes noticeable\r\nwhen they have been moistened. That of \"_Nasturtium Hortense_\" he\r\ndescribes as very large, \"even emulous of the inner Pulp surrounding\r\na _Gooseberry-Seed_.\" He suggests that the value of putting a Clary\r\nseed into the eye to bring out a foreign body, which may have lodged\r\nthere, is due to the presence of the mucilaginous coat. The same seed\r\nis still, I believe, used for this purpose, under the name of \"eye\r\nseed.\" Grew understood the difference between seeds with, and without\r\nendosperm, and gives perfectly clear representations of such albuminous\r\nseeds as _Ricinus_. He describes the cotyledons of the Dock as being\r\nimmersed in the endosperm, \"as in a _Tub_ of _Meal_ or a little pot\r\nof pure refin'd _Mould_, necessary for the first _Vegetation_ of the\r\n_Radicle_.\"\r\n\r\nGrew naturally reckoned the spores of Ferns among seeds. The seed-case\r\nof the Harts-tongue is, he says, \"of a _Silver Colour_ ... of a\r\n_spherick Figure_, and girded about with a sturdy _Tendon_ or _Spring_,\r\nof the _Colour_ of _Gold_: ... So soon as ... this _Spring_ is become\r\nstark enough, it suddenly breaks the _Case_ into two halfs, like two\r\nlittle _cups_, and so flings the _Seed_,\" of which \"ten Thousand are\r\nnot so big as a white _Pepper Corn_.\"\r\n\r\nTo give any kind of short summary of Grew's botanical work is well-nigh\r\nimpossible. Some men are remembered for individual discoveries, and in\r\nsuch cases it is not difficult to give a précis of their contributions.\r\nBut Nehemiah Grew is remembered because, contemporaneously with\r\nMalpighi, he actually created the science of plant anatomy,--a subject\r\nwhich, before his day, was practically non-existent. Modern botanists,\r\nconscious how small an addition to the fabric is now regarded as a\r\nsatisfactory life-work, must stand amazed and somewhat humbled before\r\nthe broad and sound foundations laid by this seventeenth century\r\nphysician. It is no less than two hundred and forty years since Grew\r\nsent in his first treatise to the Royal Society, so it is scarcely\r\nwonderful that a number of his results have been rejected in course of\r\ntime. It is far more remarkable that so many of his conclusions--and\r\nthose the more essential ones--have been merely confirmed and extended\r\nby later work. Great however as were his actual contributions to\r\nbotanical knowledge, they were perhaps less important than the\r\nfar-reaching service which he rendered in helping to free biological\r\nthought from the cramping belief that the one and only object of\r\nthe existence of the organic world was for the use and pleasure of\r\nman. Grew believed that the \"Outward Elegancies of _Plants_\" might\r\nbe for the purpose of giving delight to the human race, but he was\r\nthe first to point out that as the \"Inward Ones, which, generally,\r\nare as Precise and Various as the Outward,\" are so seldom seen, their\r\npurpose can hardly be for this, but must be for the benefit of the\r\nplants themselves, \"That the _Corn_ might grow, _so_; and the _Flower_,\r\n_so_, whether or no Men had a mind, leisure, or ability, to understand\r\n_how_.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] _Dict.

Stephen Hales was born in\r\n1677 and died in 1761, having had experiences of the reigns of seven\r\nsovereigns.\r\n\r\nThe authorities for the life of Hales are given in my article on him in\r\nthe _Dictionary of National Biography_. Botanists in general probably\r\ntake their knowledge of the main facts of his life from Sachs' _History\r\nof Botany_. It is therefore worth while to point out that both the\r\noriginal and the English translation (1890) contain the incorrect\r\nstatement that Hales was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, and\r\nthat he held the living of Riddington, whereas he is one of the glories\r\nof Corpus, and was perpetual curate of Teddington. These inaccuracies\r\nhowever are trifles in relation to the great and striking merits of\r\nSachs' _History_, a work which to my thinking exhibits the strength and\r\nbrilliance of the author's mind as clearly as any of his more technical\r\nwritings. Sachs was no niggling biographer, and his broad vigorous\r\noutlines must form the basis of what anyone, who follows him, has to\r\nsay about the Botanists of a past day.\r\n\r\nTo return to Hales' birth: it is of interest to note how he fits\r\ninto the changing procession of lives, to see what great men overlap\r\nhis youth, who were his contemporaries in his maturity, and who were\r\nappearing on the scientific stage as he was leaving it.\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton was the dominant figure in English science while Hales\r\nwas developing. He died in 1727, the year in which Hales published\r\nhis _Vegetable Staticks_, a book, which like the _Origin of Species_,\r\nappeared when its author was 50 years of age; Newton was at the zenith\r\nof his fame when Hales was a little boy of 10--his _Principia_ having\r\nbeen published in 1687. And when Hales went up to Cambridge in 1696\r\nhe must have seen the great man coming from his rooms[17] in the N.E.\r\ncorner of the Great Court of Trinity--that corner where Newton's and\r\nother more modern ghosts surely walk--Macaulay who used to read, pacing\r\nto and fro by the chapel[18], and Thackeray who, like his own Esmond,\r\nlived \"near to the famous Mr Newton's lodgings.\" In any case there\r\ncan be no doubt that the genius of Newton cast its light on Hales, as\r\nSachs has clearly pointed out (_Hist. Bot._, Eng. Tr., p. 477). Another\r\ngreat man who influenced Hales was Robert Boyle, who was born 1627\r\nand died 1691. John Mayow again, that brilliant son of Oxford, whose\r\npremature death at 39 in 1679 was so heavy a blow to science, belongs\r\nto the same school as Hales--the school which was within an ace of\r\nfounding a rational chemistry, but which was separated from the more\r\nobvious founders of that science by the phlogiston-theory of Becchers\r\nand Stahl. I do not find any evidence that Hales was influenced by the\r\nphlogistic writers and this is comprehensible enough, if, as I think,\r\nhe belongs to the school of Mayow and Boyle.\r\n\r\nThe later discoverers in chemistry are of the following dates, Black\r\n1728-1799, Cavendish 1731-1810, Priestley 1733-1804, Scheele 1742-1786,\r\nLavoisier 1743, guillotined 1794. These were all born about the time\r\nof Hales' zenith, nor did he live[19] to see the great results they\r\naccomplished. But it should not be forgotten that Hales' chemical work\r\nmade more easy the triumphant road they trod.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of Hales in relation to chemists and physicists because,\r\nthough essentially a physiologist, he seems to me to have been a\r\nchemist and physicist who turned his knowledge to the study of life,\r\nrather than a physiologist who had some chemical knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhewell points out in his _History of the Inductive Sciences_[20] that\r\nthe Physiologist asks questions of Nature in a sense differing from\r\nthat of the Physicist. The _Why?_ of the Physicist meant _Through what\r\ncauses?_ that of the Physiologist--To what end? This distinction no\r\nlonger holds good, and if it is to be applied to Hales it is a test\r\nwhich shows him to be a physicist. For, as Sachs shows, though Hales\r\nwas necessarily a teleologist in the theological sense, he always asked\r\nfor purely mechanical explanations. He was the most unvitalistic of\r\nphysiologists, and I think his explanations suffered from this cause.\r\nFor instance, he seems to have held that to compare the effect of heat\r\non a growing root to the action of the same cause on a thermometer[21]\r\nwas a quite satisfactory proceeding. And there are many other passages\r\nin _Vegetable Staticks_ where one feels that his speculations are too\r\nheavy for his knowledge.\r\n\r\nSomething must be said of Hales' relation to his predecessors and\r\nsuccessors in Botanical work. The most striking of his immediate\r\npredecessors were Malpighi 1628-1694, Grew 1628-1711, Ray 1627-1705,\r\nand Mariotte (birth unknown, died 1684); and of these the three first\r\nwere born one hundred years before the publication of _Vegetable\r\nStaticks_. Malpighi and Grew were essentially plant-anatomists, though\r\nboth dealt in physiological speculations. Their works were known to\r\nHales, but they do not seem to have influenced him. We have seen\r\nthat as a chemist Hales is somewhat of a solitary figure, standing\r\nbetween what may be called the periods of Boyle and of Cavendish.\r\nThis is even more striking in his Botanical position, for here he\r\nstands in the solitude of all great original inquirers. We must go\r\nback to Van Helmont, 1577-1644, to find anyone comparable to him as an\r\nexperimentalist. His successors have discovered much that was hidden\r\nfrom him, but consciously or unconsciously they have all learned from\r\nhim the true method and spirit of physiological work.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that in exalting Hales I am unfair to Malpighi. It\r\nmay be fairer to follow Sachs in linking these great men together and\r\nto insist on the wonderful fact that before Malpighi's book in 1671,\r\nvegetable physiology was still where Aristotle left it, whereas 56\r\nyears later in 1727 we find in Hales' book an experimental science in\r\nthe modern sense.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that students of animal physiology agree\r\nwith botanists as to Hales' greatness. A writer in the _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_ speaks of him as \"the true founder of the modern\r\nexperimental method in physiology.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Sachs, Ray made some interesting observations on the\r\ntransmission of water, but on the whole what he says on this subject is\r\nnot important. There is no evidence that he influenced Hales.\r\n\r\nMariotte the physicist came to one physiological conclusion of great\r\nweight[22]; namely, that the different qualities of plants, e.g.\r\ntaste, odour, etc., do not depend on the absorption from the soil of\r\ndifferently scented or flavoured principles, as the Aristotelians\r\nimagined, but on _specific differences_ in the way in which different\r\nplants deal with identical food material--an idea which is at the\r\nroot of a sane physiological outlook. These views were published in\r\n1679[23], and may have been known to Hales. He certainly was interested\r\nin such ideas, as is indicated by his attempts to give flavour to\r\nfruit by supplying them with medicated fluids. He probably did not\r\nexpect success for he remarks, p. 360: \"The specifick differences of\r\nvegetables, which are all sustained and grow from the same nourishment,\r\nis [_sic_] doubtless owing to the very different formation of their\r\nminute vessels, whereby an almost infinite variety of combinations\r\nof the common principles of vegetables is made.\" He continues in the\r\nfollowing delightful passage: \"And could our eyes attain to a sight of\r\nthe admirable texture of the parts on which the specific differences\r\nin plants depends [_sic_] what an amazing and beautiful scene of\r\ninimitable embroidery should we behold? what a variety of masterly\r\nstrokes of machinery? what evident marks of consummate wisdom should\r\nwe be entertained with?\" To conclude what has been said on Hales'\r\nchronological position--Ingenhousz, the chief founder of the modern\r\npoint of view on plant nutrition, was born 1730 and published his book\r\n_On Vegetables_, etc. in 1779. So that what was said of Hales' chemical\r\nposition is again true of him considered in relation to nutrition; he\r\ndid not live to see the great discoveries made at the close of the 18th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThere is in his writing a limpid truthfulness and simplicity,\r\nunconsciously decorated with pretty 18th century words and\r\nhalf-rusticities which give it a perennial charm. And inasmuch as I\r\ndesire to represent Hales not merely as a man to be respected but also\r\nto be loved, it will be as well to give what is known of the personal\r\nside of his character before going on to a detailed account of his work.\r\n\r\nHe was, as we have seen, entered at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,\r\nin June, 1696. In February, 1702-3, he was admitted a fellow of the\r\nCollege. It was during his life as a fellow that he began to work\r\nat chemistry in what he calls \"the elaboratory in Trinity College.\"\r\nThe room is now occupied by the Senior Bursar and forms part of the\r\nbeautiful range of buildings in the bowling green, which, freed from\r\nstucco and other desecration, are made visible in their ancient\r\nguise by the piety of a son of Trinity and the wisdom of the College\r\nauthorities. It was here, according to Dr Bentley, that \"the thieving\r\nBursars of the old set embezzled the College timber[24],\" and it was\r\nthis room that was fitted up as \"an elegant laboratory\" in 1706 for\r\nJohn Francis Vigani, an Italian chemist, who had taught unofficially\r\nin the University for some years and became the first Professor of\r\nChemistry at Cambridge in 1703.\r\n\r\nJudging from his book, _Medulla Chymiae_, 1682, Vigani was an eminently\r\npractical person who cared greatly about the proper make of a furnace\r\nand the form of a retort, but was not cumbered with theories.\r\n\r\nHales vacated his fellowship and became minister or perpetual curate of\r\nTeddington[25] in 1708-9 and there he lived until his death, fifty-two\r\nyears afterwards. He was married (? 1719) and his wife died without\r\nissue in 1721.\r\n\r\nHe attracted the attention of Royalty, and received plants from the\r\nKing's garden at Hampton Court. Frederick Prince of Wales, the father\r\nof George III, is said to have been fond of surprising him in his\r\nlaboratory at Teddington. This must surely be a unique habit in a\r\nprince, but we may remember that, in the words of the Prince's mock\r\nepitaph, \"since it is only Fred there's no more to be said.\" He became\r\nClerk of the Closet to the Dowager Princess and this \"mother of the\r\nbest of Kings\" as she calls herself put up his monument in Westminster\r\nAbbey. Hales had the honour of receiving the Copley Medal from the\r\nRoyal Society in 1739, and Oxford made him a D.D. in 1733.\r\n\r\nSome years ago I made a pilgrimage to Teddington and found, in the\r\nparish registers, many interesting entries by his hand; the last in\r\na tremulous writing is on November 4th, 1760, two months before he\r\ndied. He was clearly an active parish priest. He made his female\r\nparishioners do public penance when he thought they deserved it: he did\r\nmuch for the fabric of the church. \"In 1754[26] he helped the parish\r\nto a decent water supply and characteristically records, in the parish\r\nregister, that the outflow was such as to fill a two-quart vessel in\r\n'three swings of a pendulum beating seconds, which pendulum was 39 +\r\n2/10 inches long from the suspending nail to the middle of the plumbet\r\nor bob'.\" Under the tower he helped to build (which now serves as a\r\nporch) Stephen Hales is buried, and the stone which covers his body\r\nis being worn away by the feet of the faithful. By the piety of a few\r\nbotanists a mural tablet, on which the epitaph is restored, has been\r\nplaced near the grave.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole called Hales \"a poor, good, primitive creature\" and\r\nPope[27] (who was his neighbour) said \"I shall be very glad to see Dr\r\nHales, and always love to see him, he is so worthy and good a man.\"\r\nPeter Collinson writes of \"his constant serenity and cheerfulness of\r\nmind\"; it is also recorded that \"he could look even upon wicked men,\r\nand those who did him unkind offices, without any emotion of particular\r\nindignation; not from want of discernment or sensibility; but he\r\nused to consider them only like those experiments which, upon trial,\r\nhe found could never be applied to any useful purpose, and which he\r\ntherefore calmly and dispassionately laid aside.\"\r\n\r\nHales' work may be divided into three heads:\r\n\r\n  I.   Physiological, animal and vegetable;\r\n  II.  Chemical;\r\n  III. Inventions and miscellaneous essays.\r\n\r\nUnder No. I. I shall deal only with his work on plants. The last\r\nheading (No. III.) I shall only refer to slightly, but the variety and\r\ningenuity of his miscellaneous publications is perhaps worth mention\r\nhere as an indication of the quality of his mind. It seems to me to\r\nhave had something in common with the versatile ingenuity of Erasmus\r\nDarwin and of his grandson Francis Galton. The miscellaneous work\r\nalso exhibits Hales as a philanthropist, who cared passionately for\r\nbettering the health and comfort of his fellow creatures by improving\r\ntheir conditions of life.\r\n\r\nHis chief book from the physiological and chemical point of view is\r\nhis _Vegetable Staticks_. It will be convenient to begin with the\r\nphysiological part of this book, and refer to the chemistry later.\r\n_Vegetable Staticks_ is a small 8vo of 376 pages, dated on the\r\ntitle-page 1727. The \"_Imprimatur_ Isaac Newton Pr. Reg. Soc.\" is dated\r\nFebruary 16, 1726/7, and this date is of some slight interest, for\r\nNewton died on March 20, and _Vegetable Staticks_ must have been one of\r\nthe last books he signed.\r\n\r\nThe dedication is to George Prince of Wales, afterwards George III.\r\nThe author cannot quite avoid the style of his day, for instance: \"And\r\nas _Solomon_ the greatest and wisest of men, deigned[28] to inquire\r\ninto the nature of Plants, _from the Cedar of Lebanon, to the Hyssop\r\nthat springeth out of the wall_. So it will not, I presume, be an\r\nunacceptable entertainment to your Royal Highness,\" etc.\r\n\r\nBut the real interest of the dedication is its clear statement of\r\nhis views on the nutrition of plants. He asserts that plants obtain\r\nnourishment, not only from the earth, \"but also more sublimed and\r\nexalted food from the air, that wonderful fluid, which is of such\r\nimportance to the life of Vegetables and Animals,\" etc. We shall see\r\nthat his later statement is not so definite, and it is well to rescue\r\nthis downright assertion from oblivion.\r\n\r\nHis book begins with the research for which he is best known, namely\r\nthat on transpiration. He took a sunflower growing in a flower-pot,\r\ncovering the surface of the earth with a plate of thin milled lead,\r\nand cemented it so that no vapour could pass, leaving a corked hole to\r\nallow of the plant being watered. He did not take steps to prevent loss\r\nthrough the pot, but at the end of the experiment cut off the plant,\r\ncemented the stump and found that the \"unglazed porous pot\" perspired 2\r\nozs. in 12 hours, and for this he made due allowance.\r\n\r\nThe plant so prepared he proceeded to weigh at stated intervals. He\r\nobtained the area of the leaves by dividing them into parcels according\r\nto their several sizes and measuring one leaf[29] of each parcel. The\r\nloss of water in 12 hours converted to the metric system is 1·3 c.c.\r\nper 100 sq. cm. of leaf-surface; and this is of the same order of\r\nmagnitude as Sachs' result[30], namely 2·2 c.c. per 100 sq. cm. He\r\ngoes on to measure the surface of the roots[31] and to estimate the\r\nrate of absorption per area. The calculation is of no value, since\r\nhe did not know how small a part of the roots is absorbent, nor how\r\nenormously the surface of that part is increased by the presence of\r\nroot-hairs. He goes on to estimate the rate of the flow of water up\r\nthe stem; this would be 34 cubic inches in 12 hours if the stem (which\r\nwas one square inch in section) were a hollow tube. He then allowed a\r\nsunflower stem to wither and to become completely dry, and found that\r\nit had lost ¾ of its weight, and assuming that the ¼ of the \"solid\r\nparts\" left was useless for the transmission of water he increases his\r\n34 by ⅓ and gives 45⅓ cubic inches in 12 hours as the rate. But\r\nthe solid matter which he neglected contained the vessels and he would\r\nhave been nearer to the truth had he corrected his figures on this\r\nbasis. The simplest plan is to compare his results with those obtained\r\nby Sachs[32] in allowing plants to absorb solutions of lithium-salts.\r\nIf the flow takes place through conduits equivalent to a quarter of a\r\nsquare inch in area, the fluid will rise in 12 hours to a height of\r\n4 × 34 or 136 inches or in one hour to 28·3 cm.[33] This is a result\r\ncomparable to, though very much smaller than, Sachs' result with the\r\nsunflower, viz. 63 cm. per hour.\r\n\r\nThe data are however hardly worth treating in this manner. But it\r\nis of historic interest to note that when Sachs was at work on his\r\n_Pflanzenphysiologie_, published in 1865, he was compelled to go back\r\nnearly 140 years to find any results with which he could compare his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nWe need not follow Hales into his comparison between the \"perspiration\"\r\nof the sunflower and that of a man, nor into his other transpiration\r\nexperiments on the cabbage, vine, apple, etc. But one or two points\r\nmust be noted. He found[34] the \"middle rate of perspiration\" of a\r\nsunflower in 12 hours of daylight to be 20 ounces, and that of a \"dry\r\nwarm night\" about 3 ounces; thus the day transpiration was roughly\r\nseven times the nocturnal rate. This difference may be accounted for by\r\nthe closure of the stomata at night.\r\n\r\nHales of course knew nothing of stomata, but it is surprising to find\r\nSachs in 1865 discussing the problem of transpiration with hardly a\r\nreference to the effect of stomatal closure.\r\n\r\nHales[35] notes another point which a knowledge of stomatal behaviour\r\nmight have explained, viz. that with \"scanty watering the perspiration\r\nmuch abated,\" he does not attempt an explanation but merely refers to\r\nit as a \"healthy latitude of perspiration in this Sunflower.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of his work on sunflowers he notices that the flower\r\nfollows the sun, he says however that it is \"not by turning round with\r\nthe sun,\" i.e. that it is not a twisting of the stalk, and goes on to\r\ncall it _nutation_ which must be the _locus classicus_ for the term\r\nused in this sense.\r\n\r\nAn experiment[36] that I do not remember to have seen quoted elsewhere\r\nis worth describing. It is one of the many experiments that show the\r\ngenerous scale on which his work was planned. An apple bough five feet\r\nlong was fixed to a vertical glass tube nine feet long. The tube being\r\nabove and the branch hanging below the pressure of the column of water\r\nwould act in concert with the suck of the transpiring leaves instead of\r\nin opposition to this force. He then cut the bare stem of his branch\r\nin two, placing the apical half of the specimen (bearing side branches\r\nand leaves) with its cut end in a glass vessel of water, the basal and\r\nleafless half of the branch remained attached to the vertical tube of\r\nwater. In the next 30 hours only 6 ounces dripped through the leafless\r\nbranch, whereas the leafy branch absorbed 18 ounces. This, as he says,\r\nshows the great power of perspiration. And though he does not pursue\r\nthe experiment, it is worthy of note as an attempt like those of\r\nJanse[37] and others to correlate the flow of water under pressure with\r\nthe flow due to transpiration.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find that Hales used the three methods of\r\nestimating transpiration which have been employed in modern times,\r\nnamely, (i) weighing, (ii) a rough sort of potometer, (iii) enclosing a\r\nbranch in a glass balloon and collecting the precipitated moisture, the\r\nwell-known plan followed by various French observers.\r\n\r\nHe (_Vegetable Staticks_, p. 51) concluded his balance of loss and\r\ngain in transpiring plants by estimating the amount of available water\r\nin the soil to a depth of three feet, and calculating how long his\r\nsunflower would exist without watering. He further concludes (p. 57)\r\nthat an annual rainfall (of 22 inches) is \"sufficient for all the\r\npurposes of nature, in such flat countries as this about Teddington.\"\r\n\r\nHe constantly notes small points of interest, e.g. (p. 82) that with\r\ncut branches the water absorbed diminishes each day and that the\r\nformer vigour of absorption may be partly renewed by cutting a fresh\r\nsurface[38].\r\n\r\nHe also showed (p. 89) that the transpiration current can flow\r\nperfectly well from apex to base when the apical end is immersed in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThese are familiar facts to us, but we should realise that it is to\r\nthe industry and ingenuity of Hales that we owe them. In a repetition\r\n(p. 90) of the last experiment, we have the first mention of a fact\r\nfundamentally important. He took two branches (which with a clerical\r\ntouch he calls _M_ and _N_) and having removed the bark from a part of\r\nthe branch dipped the ends in water, _N_ with the great end downwards,\r\nbut _M_ upside down. In this way he showed that the bark was not\r\nnecessary for the absorption or transmission of water[39]. I suspect\r\nthat one branch was inverted out of respect for the hypothesis of\r\nsap-circulation. He perhaps thought that water could travel apically by\r\nthe wood, but only by the bark in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nLater in his book (pp. 128 and 131) he gives definite arguments against\r\nthe hypothesis in question.\r\n\r\nNext in order (p. 95) comes his well-known experiment on the pressure\r\nexerted by peas increasing in size as they imbibe water. There\r\nare, however, pitfalls in this result of which Hales was unaware,\r\nand perhaps the chief interest to us now is that he considered the\r\nimbibition of the peas[40] to be the same order of phenomenon as the\r\nabsorption of water by a cut branch--notwithstanding the fact that he\r\nknew[41] the absorption to depend largely on the leaves. It may be\r\nnoticed that Sachs with his imbibitional view of water-transport may be\r\ncounted a follower of Hales.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain \"whether there was any lateral communication\r\nof the sap and sap vessels, as there is of blood in animals,\" Hales\r\n(p. 121) made the experiment which has been repeated in modern\r\nlaboratories[42], i.e. cutting a \"gap to the pith\" and another opposite\r\nto it and a few inches above. This he did on an oak branch six feet\r\nlong whose basal end was placed in water. The branch continued to\r\n\"perspire\" for two days, but gave off only about half the amount of\r\nwater transpired by a normal branch[43]. He does not trouble himself\r\nabout this difference, being satisfied of \"great quantities of liquor\r\nhaving passed laterally by the gap.\"\r\n\r\nHe is interested in the fact of lateral transmission in connexion\r\nwith the experiment of the suspended tree (Fig. 24, p. 126), which\r\nis dependent on the neighbours to which it is grafted for its water\r\nsupply. This seems to be one of the results that convinced him that\r\nthere is a distribution of food material which cannot be described as\r\ncirculation of sap in the sense that was then in vogue.\r\n\r\nHales (p. 143) was one of the first[44] to make the well-known\r\nexperiment--the removal of a ring of bark, with the result that the\r\nedge of bark nearest the base of the branch swells and thickens in a\r\ncharacteristic manner. He points out that if a number of rings are\r\nmade one above the other, the swelling is seen at the lower edge of\r\neach isolated piece of bark, and therefore (p. 143) the swelling\r\nmust be attributed \"to some other cause than the stoppage of the sap\r\nin its return downwards,\" because the first gap in the bark should be\r\nsufficient to check the whole of the flowing sap[45]. He must in fact\r\nhave seen that there is a redistribution of plastic material in each\r\nsection of bark.\r\n\r\nWe now for the moment leave the subject of transpiration and pass on to\r\nthat of root-pressure on which Hales is equally illuminating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure from _Vegetable Staticks_ showing a vine with\r\nmercury gauges in place to demonstrate root-pressure.]\r\n\r\nHis first experiment, _Vegetable Staticks_, p. 100, was with a\r\nvine to which he attached a vertical pipe made of three lengths of\r\nglass-tubing jointed together. His method is worth notice. He attached\r\nthe stump to the manometer with a \"stiff cement made of melted Beeswax\r\nand Turpentine, and bound it over with several folds of wet bladder\r\nand pack-thread.\" We cannot wonder that the making of water-tight\r\nconnexions was a great difficulty, and we can sympathise with his\r\nbelief that he could have got a column more than 21 feet high but for\r\nthe leaking of the joints on several occasions. He notes the familiar\r\nfact that the vine-stump absorbed water before it began to extrude it.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards (pp. 106-7) used a mercury gauge and registered a\r\nroot-pressure of 32½ inches or 36 feet 5⅓ inches of water which\r\nhe proceeds to compare with his own determination of the blood-pressure\r\nof the horse (8 feet) and of other animals. Perhaps the most\r\ninteresting of his root-pressure experiments was that (p. 110) in which\r\nseveral manometers were attached to the branches of a bleeding vine and\r\nshowed a result which convinced him that \"the force is not from the\r\nroot only, but must proceed from some power in the stem and branches,\"\r\na conclusion which some modern workers have also arrived at. The figure\r\non page 77 is a simplified reproduction of the plate (Fig. 19) in\r\n_Vegetable Staticks_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Assimilation._\r\n\r\nHales' belief that plants draw part of their food from the air, and\r\nagain that air is the breath of life, of vegetables as well as of\r\nanimals (p. 148), are based upon a series of chemical experiments\r\nperformed by himself. Not being satisfied with what he knew of the\r\nrelation between \"air\" (by which he meant gas) and the solid bodies\r\nin which he supposed gases to be fixed, he delayed the publication of\r\n_Vegetable Staticks_ for some two years, and carried out the series of\r\nobservations which are mentioned in his title-page as \"An attempt to\r\nanalyse the air, by a great variety of chymio-statical experiments\"\r\noccupying 162 pages of his book[46].\r\n\r\nThe theme of his inquiry he takes (_Vegetable Staticks_, p. 165) from\r\n\"the illustrious Sir _Isaac Newton_,\" who believed that \"Dense bodies\r\nby fermentation rarify into several sorts of Air; and this Air by\r\nfermentation, and sometimes without it, returns into dense bodies.\"\r\n\r\nHales' method consisted in heating a variety of substances, e.g.\r\nwheat-grains, pease, wood, hog's blood, fallow-deer's horn,\r\noyster-shells, red-lead, gold, etc., and measuring the \"air\" given\r\noff from them. He also tried the effect of acid on iron filings,\r\noyster-shells, etc. In the true spirit of experiment he began by\r\nstrongly heating his retorts (one of which was a musket barrel) to\r\nmake sure that no air arose from them. It is not evident to me why he\r\ncontinued at this subject so long. He had no means of distinguishing\r\none gas from another, and almost the only quality noted is a want of\r\npermanence, e.g. when the CO_2 produced was dissolved by the water\r\nover which he collected it. Sir E. Thorpe[47] points out that Hales\r\nmust have prepared hydrogen, carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, sulphur\r\ndioxide, marsh gas, etc. It may, I think, be said that Hales deserved\r\nthe title usually given to Priestley, viz. \"the father of pneumatic[48]\r\nchemistry.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting experiment made by Hales is the heating\r\nof minium (red-lead) with the production of oxygen. It proves that\r\nhe knew, as Boyle, Hooke and Mayow did before him, that a body gains\r\nweight in oxidation. Thus Hales remarks: \"That the sulphurous and\r\naereal particles of the fire are lodged in many of those bodies which\r\nit acts upon, and thereby considerably augments their weight, is very\r\nevident in Minium or Red Lead which is observed to increase in weight\r\nin undergoing the action of the fire. The acquired redness of the\r\nMinium indicating the addition of plenty of sulphur in the operation.\"\r\nHe also speaks of the gas distilled from minium, and remarks \"It\r\nwas doubtless this quantity of air in the minium which burst the\r\nhermetically sealed glasses of the excellent Mr _Boyle_, when he heated\r\nthe Minium contained in them by a burning glass\" (p. 287).\r\n\r\nThis was the method also used by Priestley in his celebrated experiment\r\nof heating red-lead in hydrogen; whereby the metallic lead reappears\r\nand the hydrogen disappears by combining with the oxygen set free.\r\nThis was expressed in the language of the day as the reconstruction of\r\nmetallic lead by the addition of phlogiston (the hydrogen) to the calx\r\nof lead (minium). Thorpe points out the magnitude of the discovery that\r\nPriestley missed, and it may be said that Hales too was on the track\r\nand had he known as much as Priestley it would not have been phlogiston\r\nthat kept him from becoming a Cavendish or Lavoisier. What chiefly\r\nconcerns us however is the bearing of Hales' chemical work on his\r\ntheories of nutrition. He concludes that \"air makes a very considerable\r\npart of the substance of Vegetables,\" and goes on to say (p. 211)\r\nthat \"many of these particles of air\" are \"in a fixt state strongly\r\nadhering to and wrought into the substance of\" plants[49]. He has some\r\nidea of the instability of complex substances and of the importance of\r\nthe fact, for he says[50] that \"if all the parts of matter were only\r\nendued with a strongly attracting power, [the] whole [of] nature would\r\nthen become one unactive cohering lump.\" This may remind us of Herbert\r\nSpencer's words: \"Thus the essential characteristic of living organic\r\nmatter, is that it unites this large quantity of contained motion with\r\na degree of cohesion that permits temporary fixity of arrangement,\"\r\n_First Principles_, § 103. With regard to the way in which plants\r\nabsorb and fix the \"air\" which he finds in their tissues, Hales is\r\nnot clear; he does not in any way distinguish between respiration and\r\nassimilation. But as I have already said he definitely asserts that\r\nplants draw \"sublimed and exalted food\" from the air.\r\n\r\nAs regards the action of light on plants, he suggests (p. 327) that\r\n\"by freely entering the expanded surfaces of leaves and flowers\" light\r\nmay \"contribute much to the ennobling principles of vegetation.\"\r\nHe goes on to quote Newton (_Opticks, query 30_): \"The change of\r\nbodies into light, and of light into bodies is very conformable to\r\nthe course of nature, which seems delighted with transformations.\"\r\nIt is a problem for the antiquary to determine whether or no Swift\r\ntook from Newton the idea of bottling and recapturing sunshine as\r\npractised by the philosopher of Lagado. He could hardly have got it\r\nfrom Hales since _Gulliver's Travels_ was published in 1726, a year\r\nbefore _Vegetable Staticks_. Timiriazeff, in his Croonian Lecture[51],\r\nwas the first to see the connexion between photosynthesis and the\r\nLagado research. Nevertheless Hales is not quite consistent about\r\nthe action of light; thus (p. 351) he speaks of the dull light in a\r\nclosely planted wood as checking the perspiration of the lower branches\r\nso that \"drawing little nourishment, they perish.\" This is doubtless\r\none effect of bad illumination under the above-named conditions, but\r\nthe check to photosynthesis is a more serious result. In his final\r\nremarks on vegetation (p. 375) Hales says in relation to greenhouses,\r\n\"it is certainly of as great importance to the life of the plants to\r\ndischarge that infected rancid air by the admission of fresh, as it is\r\nto defend them from the extream cold of the outward air.\" This idea\r\nof ventilating greenhouses he carried out in a plant house designed\r\nby him for the Dowager Princess of Wales, in which warm fresh air was\r\nadmitted. The house in question was built in 1761 in the Princess's\r\ngarden at Kew, which afterwards became what we now know as Kew Gardens.\r\nThe site of Hales' greenhouse, which was only pulled down in 1861, is\r\nmarked by a big _Wistaria_ which formerly grew on the greenhouse wall.\r\nIt should be recorded that Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer[52] planned a similar\r\narrangement independently of Hales, and found it produced a marked\r\nimprovement of the well-being of the plants.\r\n\r\nIt is an illuminating fact that though Hales must have known Malpighi's\r\ntheory of the function of leaves (which was broadly speaking the same\r\nas his own), he does not as far as I know refer to it. In his preface,\r\np. ii, he regrets that Malpighi and Grew, whose anatomical knowledge he\r\nappreciated, had not \"fortuned to have fallen into this _statical_[53]\r\nway of inquiry.\" I believe he means an inquiry of an experimental\r\nnature, and I think it was because Malpighi's theory was dependent on\r\nanalogy rather than on ascertained facts, that it influenced Hales so\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nThere is another part of physiology on which Hales threw light. He\r\nwas the first I believe to investigate the distribution of growth in\r\ndeveloping shoots and growing leaves by marking them and measuring the\r\ndistance between the marks after an interval of time. He describes (p.\r\n330) and figures (p. 344) with his usual thoroughness the apparatus\r\nemployed: this was a comb-like object, shown in Plate IX, made by\r\nfixing five pins into a handle, ¼ inch apart from one another: the\r\npoints being dipped in red-lead and oil, a young vine-shoot was marked\r\nwith ten dots ¼ inch apart. In the autumn he examined his specimen\r\nand finds that the youngest internode or \"joynt\" had grown most, and\r\nthe basal part having been \"almost hardened\" when he marked, had\r\n\"extended very little.\" In this--a tentative experiment--he made the\r\nmistake of not re-measuring his plants at short intervals of time, but\r\nit was an admirable beginning and the direct ancestor of Sachs'[54]\r\ngreat research on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn his discussion on growth it is interesting to find the idea of\r\nturgescence supplying the motive force for extension. This conception\r\nhe takes from Borelli[55].\r\n\r\nHales sees in the nodes of plants \"plinths or abutments for the\r\ndilating pith to exert its force on\" (p. 335); but he acutely foresees\r\na modern objection[56] to the explanation of growth as regulated solely\r\nby the hydrostatic pressure in the cell. Hales says (p. 335): \"but a\r\ndilating spongy substance, by equally expanding itself every way, would\r\nnot produce an oblong shoot, but rather a globose one.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not my place to speak of Hales' work in animal physiology, nor\r\nof those researches bearing on the welfare of the human race which\r\noccupied his later years. Thus he wrote against the habit of drinking\r\nspirits, and made experiments on ventilation by which he benefited both\r\nEnglish and French prisons, and even the House of Commons; then too he\r\nwas occupied in attempts to improve the method of distilling potable\r\nwater at sea, and of preserving meat and biscuit on long voyages[57].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate IX_\r\n\r\nPlate 18 from Hales's _Vegetable Staticks_\r\n\r\nFig. 40.

The use of a similar instrument for marking surfaces\r\nis shown in Figs. 43 and 44]\r\n\r\nWe are concerned with him simply as a vegetable physiologist and in\r\nthat character his fame is imperishable. Of the book which I have been\r\nusing as my text, namely, _Vegetable Staticks_, Sachs says: \"It was\r\nthe first comprehensive work the world had seen which was devoted to\r\nthe nutrition of plants and the movement of their sap.... Hales had\r\nthe art of making plants reveal themselves. By experiments carefully\r\nplanned and cunningly carried out he forced them to betray the energies\r\nhidden in their apparently inactive bodies[58].\" These words, spoken by\r\na great physiologist of our day, form a fitting tribute to one who is\r\njustly described as the father of physiology.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] In 1699 Newton was made master of the Mint and appointed Whiston\r\nhis Deputy in the Lucasian Professorship, an office he finally resigned\r\nin 1703 (Brewster's _Life of Newton_, 1831, p. 249).\r\n\r\n[18] \"There, if anywhere, his dear shade must linger,\" Trevelyan, _Life\r\nand Letters of Lord Macaulay_, 1 volume edit. 1881, p. 55.\r\n\r\n[19] Black's discovery of CO_2, however, was published in 1754, seven\r\nyears before Hales died, but Priestley's, Cavendish's and Lavoisier's\r\nwork on O and H was later.\r\n\r\n[20] 1837, III. p. 389.\r\n\r\n[21] _Vegetable Staticks_, p. 346.\r\n\r\n[22] Sachs, _Geschichte_, p. 502.

HILL\r\n\r\n  Narrative--chequered career--journalism--attack on the Royal\r\n  Society--literary activities--Botanical works--structure\r\n  of Timber--the sleep of Plants--Mimosa and Abrus--views on\r\n  Pollen--Hill's _Herbal_--his admiration of Linnaeus--with\r\n  qualifications--Hill's _Vegetable System_--an ambitious\r\n  work--financial losses--estimate of Hill's character.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has recently been remarked that the number of the biographies of\r\neminent men is inversely proportional to the known facts concerning\r\nthem. Although this generalisation is probably incorrect, it is, to\r\na certain extent, true of John Hill; for, although he finds a place\r\nin biographical dictionaries, apparently no extended account of his\r\nlife has appeared. This is a little surprising since, apart from his\r\nscientific work, he occupied a prominent position in the middle of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate X_ JOHN HILL]\r\n\r\nJohn Hill was the second son of the Rev. Theophilous Hill, and was\r\nborn either at Spalding or at Peterborough in the year 1716 or 1717.\r\nNothing appears to be known regarding his early education; according to\r\nHawkins[59] he did not receive an academical education, but there is\r\nno doubt that, as was usual for those who desired to practise medicine\r\nat that and at much later times, he served his apprenticeship to an\r\napothecary, it is said, at Westminster; also he attended the lectures\r\non Botany given under the auspices of the Apothecaries' Company at the\r\nChelsea Physic Garden. He first practised in St Martin's Lane in a\r\nshop which, according to Woodward[60], was little more than a shed;\r\nfrom there he moved to Westminster, and it appears that at the age of\r\ntwenty-one he had a practice in Covent Garden. He early experienced\r\nfinancial difficulties; indeed, it is stated that, at times, he was\r\nunable to provide himself with the bare necessities of life. His\r\nmarriage with a dowerless maiden, Miss Travers, did not improve his\r\nprospects, and he sought to add to his income by the utilization of\r\nhis botanical knowledge. He travelled over the country collecting\r\nplants, which he dried, put up into sets with descriptions and sold\r\nby subscription; also he arranged the collections and gardens of the\r\nDuke of Richmond and Lord Petrie. Hill soon found that Botany, from\r\nthe monetary point of view, was unprofitable; he therefore decided to\r\ntry his fortune on the stage, and appeared at the Haymarket and Covent\r\nGarden.\r\n\r\nWoodward[61] gives a very amusing account of him in his new profession.\r\nAfter giving examples to shew Hill's limitations, he remarks:\r\n\"There was a time at the celebrated Theatre of _May Fair_ he [Marr]\r\nrepresented _Altamont_, and the _Great Inspector_ [Hill] attempted\r\n_Lothario_; and the polite Audience of that Place all choruss'd and\r\nagreed with you, when you dying, said, 'O Altamont! thy Genius is the\r\nstronger.'... Can I forget, great Sir, your acting _Constant_, in the\r\n_Provok'd Wife_, and your _innocent_ Rape of Mrs Woffington; when, in\r\na certain Passage, where, at least, a seeming Manliness was necessary,\r\nyou handled her so awkwardly, that she joined the Audience in laughing\r\nat you.\"\r\n\r\nWoodward's account may be accepted as being substantially correct, for\r\nin many ways Hill shewed that he lacked the qualities requisite for a\r\nsuccessful career on the stage in those days.\r\n\r\nHaving thus failed as an actor, Hill returned to the practice of\r\nmedicine and seemingly with more success, for in 1746 he was serving\r\nas a regimental surgeon, a position doubtless not very remunerative\r\nbut helping to keep the wolf from the door. This same year saw the\r\npublication of Theophrastus's treatise on gems. In its new guise the\r\nvalue of the work was much enhanced since Hill intercalated much\r\ninformation that was lacking in the original; further, the work was so\r\nwell executed that it gained him the attention and good-will of eminent\r\nFellows of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nThe publication of this work was probably the turning point in Hill's\r\ncareer, and its success must have influenced him not a little in the\r\ndetermination of following a literary career. In 1846 he edited the\r\n_British Magazine_, a periodical which lived but four years. His\r\nactivities in this direction were phenomenal, and it is hard to realize\r\nhow he managed to find time for so much work, for in addition to his\r\nbotanical publications, which will be considered hereafter, he wrote\r\non such diverse subjects as the art of acting, the conduct of married\r\nlife, theology, naval history, astronomy, entomology, human anatomy and\r\nother medical subjects. Also he wrote an opera, two farces, and certain\r\nnovels. Much of this output represents mere hack work, but it shews\r\nthat Hill had an enormous capacity for work, indeed on one occasion\r\nwhen he was sick, he confessed to a friend that he had overtaxed his\r\nstrength in writing seven works at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe _Dictionary of National Biography_ gives 76 titles of his\r\npublications, exclusive of eight which are generally attributed to him.\r\nHill's output was probably even more extensive, for towards the latter\r\npart of his career he sometimes used to publish under a pseudonym. It\r\nis the more remarkable since he found time to enjoy the good things of\r\nthe world, without which indulgence, according to his biographer[62],\r\n\"he could not have undergone the fatigue and study inseparable from the\r\nexecution of his vast designs.\" Again, according to Fitzgerald[63], he\r\nwas \"invariably in the front row at the theatres, exciting attention by\r\nhis splendid dress and singular behaviour. When there was loud applause\r\nfor the King, the doctor was seen to rise, and bow gravely to his\r\nMajesty.\"\r\n\r\nThe next few years were eventful ones for Hill. In 1751 he contributed\r\na daily letter, called the _Inspector_, to the _London Advertiser and\r\nLiterary Gazette_; although they came to an end in 1753, the Inspectors\r\nwere highly remunerative, thus it is stated that in one year Hill\r\nprofited to the extent of £1500 by their sale, a very large sum for\r\njournalistic work in those days. They thus brought him very prominently\r\nbefore the public, and incidentally proved a source of some trouble to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the _Inspector_ justice has not been altogether\r\ndone to Hill: no doubt, as Isaac Disraeli[64] states, that in them\r\nhe retailed all the great matters relating to himself and all the\r\nlittle matters relating to others, but they were not all concerned in\r\nretailing the tales of scandal heard in the Coffee Houses and other\r\nplaces of public resort; nor were they always rendered palatable by\r\nthese means as is stated in Rose's _Biographical Dictionary_[65].\r\nThey, in addition to comments and criticisms on current affairs,\r\ntreated of many subjects. For instance, one considers the proposal\r\nfor uniting the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, another is a\r\nvery sympathetic and laudatory review of Gray's _Elegy_, whilst a\r\nthird treats of the art of embalming. Many are concerned with Natural\r\nHistory, and these are important as they shew Hill in another and\r\nvery important character, namely that of a popular writer on Natural\r\nHistory, especially Botany. In one number he described the structure\r\nof a common flower, including an account of the movements of a bee\r\nin collecting pollen; and in another he described the appearance of\r\nmicroscopic organisms paying marked attention to their activities.\r\nThese particular Inspectors are very pleasing and are well and clearly\r\nwritten; one especially is of outstanding importance, as it shews that\r\nHill was in some respects far in advance of his times. He put forward a\r\nsuggestion that Botany would be much improved by the delivery of public\r\nlectures in the museum with the living plants before the lecturer and\r\nthe members of the audience. This scheme has yet to be carried out; as\r\nthey are, museums are a means of education for the few, but a source of\r\nconfusion to the many. For the latter their educative value would be\r\nenormously increased by the delivery of lectures illustrated by the\r\nexhibits, for the spoken word is more abiding than the printed label.\r\n\r\nThe methods of criticism pursued by Hill in the _Inspector_ soon\r\ninvolved him in controversy with various people. It is a difficult\r\nmatter to appraise him in these respects; possibly his success had\r\nturned his head for, according to Baker[66], he shewed \"an unbounded\r\nstore of vanity and self-sufficiency, which had for years lain dormant\r\nbehind the mask of their direct opposite qualities of humility and\r\ndiffidence; a pride which was perpetually laying claim to homage by\r\nno means his due, and a vindictiveness which never could forgive\r\nthe refusal of it to him.\" Baker then goes on to remark that as a\r\nconsequence of this, every affront however slight was revenged by Hill\r\nby a public attack on the morals etc. of the maker.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand his criticisms may have been honest, at any rate in\r\npart; and the fact that they landed him into difficulties does not\r\nnecessarily indicate that he was a dishonest fellow; most people are\r\nimpatient of adverse criticism, and in those days such impatience\r\nfound a vent in a pamphlet war or in personal violence. Nowadays the\r\naggrieved manager, for instance, can shut his theatre doors against the\r\ndistasteful critic; or, in other cases, an action for libel appears to\r\nbe not altogether unfashionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_His attack on the Royal Society._\r\n\r\nThe real origin of Hill's attack on this learned society is somewhat\r\nobscure.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his death Chambers was engaged in the preparation of\r\na supplement to his _Cyclopaedia_. The publishers then commissioned\r\nJohn Lewis Scott to prepare the work, but as Scott was soon afterwards\r\nappointed tutor to the royal princes it was entrusted to Hill. It\r\nis stated that the botanical articles were quite good, but that the\r\nmore general parts were done with Hill's \"characteristic carelessness\r\nand self-sufficiency.\" When the work was approaching completion the\r\npublishers considered that the title-page would look better if Hill had\r\nthe right of adding F.R.S. after his name. He, in consequence, and, it\r\nis stated, contrary to the advice of Folkes, endeavoured to obtain the\r\nnecessary qualification for candidature; but he was disliked to such\r\nan extent that he could not obtain the requisite number of signatures,\r\nthree, for his certificate, notwithstanding the fact that the number\r\nof Fellows was about three hundred. This perhaps was hardly surprising\r\nsince he had criticized his contemporary scientists very adversely,\r\ndesignating them by such terms as \"butterfly hunters,\" \"cockle shell\r\nmerchants\" and \"medal scrapers.\" This reverse must have been a severe\r\nblow to his vanity, for there can be no doubt that his claims to the\r\nFellowship, on scientific grounds, were as strong as any and stronger\r\nthan those of most of the Fellows. And this Hill, who was by no\r\nmeans lacking in self-confidence, knew. His criticism of the Society\r\nculminated in his _Review of the Works of the Royal Society of London_\r\n(1751)[67], which was in appearance like that of the _Transactions_,\r\nand consisted of reviews of several papers with comments by Hill. The\r\nwork was dedicated to Martin Folkes, the President, on whom he placed\r\nthe responsibility for publication, for, wrote he in his dedication,\r\n\"The Purport of the more considerable of them has been long since\r\ndelivered to you in conversation; and if you had thought the Society\r\ndeserved to escape the Censure that must attend this Method of laying\r\nthem before the World, you might have prevented it, by making the\r\nnecessary Use of them in private.\r\n\r\n\"Nor is this, Sir, the only Sense in which you have been the great\r\nInstrument of their Production; since it cannot but be acknowledged,\r\nthat if any body, except your great Self, had been in the high Office\r\nyou so worthily fill at present, the Occasions of many of the more\r\nremarkable of them could not have been received by the Body, under\r\nwhose Countenance alone they claim their Places in this Work.\"\r\n\r\nHe then charges Folkes with unworthy conduct towards him, and, in\r\nbrief, he considered that Folkes and Baker were his enemies. The\r\nreason for this, according to Hill, was as follows. An eminent French\r\ncorrespondent had taxed him, supposing him to be a Fellow, with \"one\r\nof the errors of the Society\"; Hill in reply wrote, \"I have already\r\nset right the error you complain of; but you are to know, that I have\r\nthe Honour not to be a Member of the Royal Society of London.\" Before\r\nhe had sealed this letter he was called out of the room, and before he\r\nhad returned a visitor, a Fellow of the Society, was shown into Hill's\r\nstudy and read the letter containing the above-quoted passage. Hence\r\nthe friction. Hill denies that he ever became a candidate for election,\r\nand states that although he attended the meetings he would not become a\r\nmember on account of the Society's method of performing that which they\r\nwere founded to do.\r\n\r\nThese statements are not lacking in definition; with regard to the\r\nincident of the letter it is impossible to judge of the truth; but\r\nwith regard to the main features of the controversy the present\r\nwriter thinks it extremely probable that the account first given is\r\nsubstantially correct, notwithstanding the statement that Hill's\r\nexplanation was never contradicted[68].\r\n\r\nAs regards the _Review_, Hill wrote that \"he pretends to nothing but\r\nthe knowing more than the Royal Society of London appears by its\r\npublications to know! and surely a Man may do that and yet be very\r\nignorant!\"\r\n\r\nThe intention of the _Review_ was to point out to the Society its\r\nshortcomings, doubtless in order that it might reform itself.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt whatever that a candid critic was necessary, for\r\nsome of the papers were absolute rubbish, so much so indeed that a\r\nscientific training does not appear necessary to detect their futility.\r\nTo take a brief example; in one paper the author describes a method to\r\nmake trees grow very large; the seeds are to be sown at the absolute\r\nmoment of the entry of the sun into the vernal equinox, and then to\r\ntransplant them at the moment when the moon is full.\r\n\r\nHill himself sometimes falls into error in his criticisms; thus he\r\nadversely comments on the truth of the power of cobwebs to catch\r\nthrushes[69].\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of Part VII of his _Review_, which treats of plants,\r\nhe thrusts very deep. He says, \"This is a Branch of Natural Knowledge,\r\nwhich, it will appear, that the Royal Society of London have looked so\r\nvery deeply into, that their rejecting the Linnean System of Botany,\r\nwhen offered by its Author will no longer be wondered at.\"\r\n\r\nIn this Part he is particularly severe upon Baker, and, in reading it,\r\none is forced to the conclusion that although adverse criticism was\r\nwarranted, there was a good deal of personal feeling behind it.\r\n\r\nThis attack on the Royal Society appears to have been much resented,\r\nand Hill's credit consequently was much damaged, for it was considered\r\nthat Folkes and Baker had befriended him in his earlier days. With\r\nregard to Folkes it has been seen that Hill considered that he was\r\ndoing a public duty; and with regard to Baker, Hill suffered under a\r\nreal or imaginary grievance which, assuming Baker had helped him in\r\nthe past, cancelled all obligations due from him to Baker. If this\r\nbe not so then Hill, in addition to his other faults, was lacking in\r\ngratitude. With regard to this point his anonymous biographer[70] wrote\r\nthat \"we have nowhere learnt that ingratitude had the smallest share in\r\nthe composition of the character of Sir John Hill.\"\r\n\r\nThe attack, however, was not altogether fruitless, as Disraeli[71]\r\nremarks, \"Yet Sir John Hill, this despised man, after all the fertile\r\nabsurdities of his literary life, performed more for the improvement of\r\nthe Philosophical Transactions, and was the cause of diffusing a more\r\ngeneral taste for the science of botany, than any other contemporary.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to remark that Hill was never elected to the\r\nRoyal Society.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus by his methods of criticism Hill brought to an end a period of\r\nhighly remunerative literary work; it was therefore necessary for him\r\nto seek other pastures. He returned, in part, to the practice of\r\nmedicine in the shape of herbalist, preparing remedies from various\r\nplants such as valerian, water-dock and centaury; also he wrote on the\r\nvirtues of these and other plants. The source from which he obtained\r\nhis plants was in the first instance the Chelsea Physic Garden, but\r\nit is stated that he was eventually forbidden its use owing to his\r\ndepredations; later he grew the requisite plants in his own garden\r\nwhich was situated where now is Lancaster Gate. There was a good deal\r\nof common sense in his remedies; thus in his _Virtues of British Herbs_\r\nhe remarks that \"He who seeks the herb for its cure, will find it half\r\neffected by the walk.\"\r\n\r\nBy the sale of his medicines and of his pamphlets relating to medicinal\r\nplants, some of which ran through many editions, he made large sums of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to a consideration of Hill's botanical work brief\r\ncomment may be made on his literary activities other than those already\r\nalluded to. It has already been mentioned that much of his output\r\nrepresented mere hack work, so that it is not surprising to learn, in\r\nview of the large amount of work he did, that a certain proportion of\r\nit was careless and slovenly, and shewed marked signs of undue haste\r\nin production, with the result that his reputation suffered. One\r\nwork, entitled _Letters from the Inspector to a Lady with the genuine\r\nAnswers_ (1752), is an amorous correspondence not remarkable for its\r\nreticence of statement; it reminds one of a similar, but more proper,\r\ncorrespondence, which had a vogue a few years ago.\r\n\r\nHill did not always write for gain, thus _Thoughts concerning God and\r\nNature_ (1755) shews him in a different light. This was written from\r\nconscientious and religious motives in answer to a book written by\r\nHenry St John Viscount Bolingbroke, and was published at a loss, for\r\nthe number printed, even if all were sold, would not have paid the\r\nexpenses of production.\r\n\r\nHis dramatic pieces were of a mediocre nature, and with regard to\r\nhis novels and other works Baker[72] states that \"In some parts of\r\nhis novels incidents are not disagreeably related, but most of them\r\nare nothing more than narratives of private intrigues, containing,\r\nthroughout, the grossest calumnies, and aiming at the blackening and\r\nundermining the private characters of many respectable and amiable\r\npersonages. In his essays, which are by much the best of his writings,\r\nthere is, in general, a liveliness of imagination, and a prettiness in\r\nthe manner of extending perhaps some very trivial thought; which, at\r\nthe first _coup-d'œil_, is pleasing enough, and may, with many, be\r\nmistaken for it; but, on a nearer examination, the imagined sterling\r\nwill be found to dwindle down into mere French plate.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to his literary work Hill found time to undertake official\r\nduties. In 1760 he was gardener at Kensington Palace, a post which\r\nbrought him in an income of £2000 per annum[73]; also he was Justice of\r\nthe Peace for Westminster. According to Mrs Hill[74] he was nominated\r\nSuperintendent of the Royal Gardens, Kew, and as such he is described\r\non his portrait; his nomination, however, does not appear to have been\r\nconfirmed, for Thiselton-Dyer[75] states that there is no evidence of\r\nhis ever having occupied such a position. Hill also advised, at the\r\nrequest of the Earl of Bute, the governors of various islands regarding\r\ntheir cultivation, for which work he received no remuneration[76].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anatomy._\r\n\r\nAnatomical investigations during the eighteenth century were very\r\nbarren of results, no real advance upon the discoveries of Grew,\r\nMalpighi and others being made. The work of Hill in this field forms\r\nno exception to this statement; and, although he accomplished a fair\r\namount of anatomical work, his investigations apparently were without\r\nresult in the advancement of this particular branch of knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn 1770 Hill published a small octavo volume on _The Construction\r\nof Timber_. In order that other investigators might benefit from his\r\nexperience he fully described and figured the instruments used; of\r\nparticular interest is a small hand microtome with which he cut his\r\nsections. This ingenious tool was the invention of Cummings, and does\r\nnot differ in essentials markedly from some the writer has seen in use;\r\nHill claims that when the cutter was particularly sharp sections no\r\nthicker than a 2000th part of an inch could be obtained. The microscope\r\nwas made by Adams under the direction of Hill and his patron, unnamed\r\nin the book, but in all probability Lord Bute, and embodied some\r\nimprovements on earlier instruments. This microscope is figured in\r\nCarpenter's work on _The Microscope and its Revelations_[77].\r\n\r\nThe _Construction of Timber_ is well arranged: the work begins with a\r\ngeneral description of the tissues and their disposition in a thickened\r\nstem; then follows a more detailed account of the separate tissues; and\r\nfinally much space is devoted to a comparison of different tissues in\r\nvarious plants.\r\n\r\nHill's account is fully illustrated with copper plates; his figures of\r\nsections are not highly magnified, some not more than twelve times, and\r\ntheir quality is not equal to the best in Grew's _Anatomy_.\r\n\r\nHill principally studied transverse sections, and consequently fell\r\ninto errors which he might have avoided by the careful observation of\r\nlongitudinal ones; also he used macerated material, but as his method\r\npreserved only the stronger walled elements he did not gain to any\r\ngreat extent from their use.\r\n\r\nThe parts devoted to comparative anatomy are not at all bad, and they\r\ngive a concrete idea of the differences obtaining in the different\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nHe apparently understood the nature of the annual rings, and of them\r\nhe wrote as follows: \"These are the several coats of Wood, added from\r\nseason to season. It has been supposed that each circle is the growth\r\nof a year; but a careful attention to the encrease of wood has shewn\r\nme, beyond a doubt, that two such are formed each year; the one in the\r\nSpring, the other soon after Midsummer.\" His illustration, however, is\r\nnot so clear as his statement. Also he realized that the wood vessels\r\nwere in some way connected with water:\r\n\r\n\"These vessels arise in the substance of the Wood, principally towards\r\nthe outer edge of each circle. They are very large in the outermost\r\ncoat; and smaller in the others: and there are also irregular ranges\r\nof them, running thro' the thicknesses of the circles; besides these\r\nprincipal ones of the outer course. They have solid, and firm, coats;\r\nand they contain in Spring, and at Midsummer, a limpid liquor, like\r\nwater, but with a slight acidity: at all other seasons of the year\r\nthey appear empty, their sides only being moistened with the same acid\r\nliquor. Those who examined them at such seasons, thought them air\r\nvessels; and in that opinion, formed a construction for them, which\r\nNature does not avow.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Hill recognized the entity of the cell he had, in common with\r\nhis contemporaries, no clear conception of its real nature.\r\n\r\nIn describing the pith of the rose he does not go astray, and he fully\r\nappreciated that the seemingly double contour of the cell walls, when\r\nseen in some sections, is due to the thickness of the section with\r\nconsequent overlapping of the cells; on the other hand he went very\r\nwrong in the case of the pith of the walnut, the cavities of which he\r\nsupposed to be cells like those of the rose, only very much larger and\r\nuniseriate as the following quotation shews:\r\n\r\n\"The Pith of the Walnut consists only of one range of these bladders\r\n['Blebs' or cells], smaller at the edges, largest in the middle, and\r\nlaid very exactly one upon the other.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he considers the structure of more or less square or oblong cells\r\nhis ideas are very wrong. In such cases he thought that the transverse\r\nwalls were spaces, and the longitudinal walls vessels; curiously enough\r\nHedwig made a similar mistake some years later, possibly he was led\r\nastray by Hill's misconception.\r\n\r\nHill adversely criticized the theory that the pith is an organ of\r\npropagation, and substituted the view that the corona--i.e. the\r\nperi-medullary zone--is all important in this connexion, \"From it\r\narises the branches, and encrease of the tree.\"\r\n\r\nHill had considerable technical ability and, I think, was capable of\r\ngreatly advancing anatomical botany; unfortunately, however, he gave\r\ntoo little time and thought to his investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Physiology._\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century saw the birth of vegetable physiology, Hales\r\nand Knight being the two great pioneers in this country. The former\r\nflourished in the early part of the century, whilst Knight, although\r\nborn in 1758, published his great work in 1806.\r\n\r\nThe chief physiological work of Hill is embodied in a pamphlet of\r\n59 pages, entitled _The Sleep of Plants and Causes of Motion in the\r\nSensitive Plant explain'd_, published in London in 1757, a year\r\nprevious to the appearance of Du Hamel's _Physique des Arbres_. The\r\npaper is in the form of a letter to Linnaeus, and in it the author\r\nexplains his position with regard to his earlier criticisms of the\r\nLinnaean system of classification.\r\n\r\nThe work is divided into sections, the first of which consists of a\r\nbrief historical _resumé_, the opinions of Acosta, Alpinus, Ray and\r\nLinnaeus on this subject being alluded to. No mention, however, is made\r\nof the observations of Bonnet and of Mairan to the effect that the\r\nperiodic movements of _Mimosa pudica_ continued when the plant was kept\r\nin prolonged darkness.\r\n\r\nIn Section 2, after describing the structure of a leaf, Hill\r\nremarks that \"Leaves are always surrounded by the air; and they are\r\noccasionally and variously influenced by heat, light, and moisture.\r\nThey are naturally complicated, and they act on most occasions\r\ntogether. We are therefore to observe, first, what effects result from\r\ntheir mutual combinations in a state of nature: and having assigned in\r\nthese cases the effect to the proper and particular cause, from this\r\npower of that agent, whichsoever it is, that acts thus in concert with\r\nthe rest, we may deduce its operations singly.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage, although not particularly clear, indicates that Hill\r\nfully appreciated the fact that the reaction exhibited by a plant organ\r\nis a response to the resultant of a number of forces, and that each\r\nfactor must be examined separately.\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to describe his observations on _Abrus_; the structure\r\nof the leaf, more especially the course of the vascular bundles, is\r\nfirst dealt with, and then an explanation of the action of light is\r\ngiven. Needless to say, in view of the state of physical science at\r\nthis period, his explanation, although ingenious, is wide of the mark.\r\nHe wrote that \"Light is subtile, active, and penetrating: by the\r\nsmallness of its constituent parts, it is capable of entering bodies;\r\nand by the violence of its motion, of producing great effects and\r\nchanges in them. These are not permanent, because those rays which\r\noccasion them, are, in that very action, extinguished and lost.\r\n\r\n\"Bodies may act on light without contact; for the rays may become\r\nreflected when they come extreamly near: but light can act on bodies\r\nonly by contact; and in that contact the rays are lost. The change\r\nproduced in the position of the leaves of plants by light, is the\r\nresult of a motion occasioned by its rays among their fibres: to\r\nexcite this motion, the light must touch those fibres; and where\r\nlight touches, it adheres, and becomes immediately extinguished....\r\nThe raising of the lobes in these leaves will be owing to the power\r\nof those rays which at any one instance fall upon them: these become\r\nextinguished; but others immediately succeed to them, so long as the\r\nair in which the plants stands, is enlightened.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough it was not until 1822, when Dutrochet pointed out the true\r\nsignificance of the pulvini, Hill recognized that these structures\r\nwere concerned with the movements of the leaflets, not only in the\r\ncase of _Abrus_, but also in _Mimosa_. He remarked that \"It is on the\r\noperation of light upon these interwoven clusters of fibres [which are\r\nplaced at the bases of the main rib, and of the several foot-stalks of\r\nthe lobes], that the motion of the leaves in gaining their different\r\npositions depends; and consequently, the motion itself is various\r\naccording to the construction of these fibres.\r\n\r\n\"In the Abrus they are large, and of a lax composition; consequently\r\nthe lobes are capable of a drooping, an horizontal, and an oblique\r\nupward position: in the Tamarind, and the broad-leaved Robinia, they\r\nare more compact, and hence all the motion of which those leaves are\r\ncapable, is an expanding open and a closing sideways; which the\r\ndirection and course of the fibres also favours: in the Parkinsonia\r\nthey are smaller, and yet more compact; and the consequence of this\r\nis, that its lobes have no farther possible motion, than the expanding\r\nupwards.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, \"The clusters of fibres are as a kind of joints on which their\r\nlobes are capable, under the influence of light, of a certain limited\r\nmotion.\"\r\n\r\nFurther, with regard to _Mimosa_, he remarks that \"To propagate the\r\nmotion when the leaves are in a state to shew it, there requires a\r\nperfect and confirmed state of those clusters of fibres lodged at their\r\nbase.\" Hill then describes the experiments upon which he based his\r\nconclusions; these shew that he was fully awake to the importance of\r\nkeeping the conditions of an experiment, other than those of light, as\r\nnear constant as possible, and that the position assumed by the leaves\r\ndepends upon the intensity of the light.\r\n\r\nHis final experiment was to place the _Abrus_ in a bookcase in such a\r\nposition that the sun shone full upon it; when the leaves were fully\r\nexpanded he closed the doors and found that in an hour \"The lobes were\r\nall drop't, and it was in the same state that it would have shewn at\r\nmidnight. On reopening the doors the elevated position of the leaves\r\nwas assumed in twenty minutes.\"\r\n\r\nHill offers the same explanation of the movements of _Mimosa_\r\nas of those exhibited by _Abrus_, the reason for their greater\r\nconspicuousness in the former plant being due to the fact that in\r\n_Mimosa_ \"As there are no less than three sets of these clusters [of\r\nfibres which are placed at the bases of the foot-stalks], the effects\r\nof the same principle are naturally much greater than in the Abrus\r\nwhere there is only one.\"\r\n\r\nHill carefully observed the sequence of motion in the _Mimosa_, and\r\npoints out that the effect of absolute darkness on the plant is greater\r\nthan the rudest touch. He also found that the contact stimulus must\r\nbe of a sufficient intensity, and that the degree of the subsequent\r\nmotion depended upon the potency of the stimulus. He further observed\r\nthat shaking the plant had the same effect as contact stimulation;\r\nalso he remarks upon the fact that the movements of the _Mimosa_ and\r\nof the Tamarind are less well-marked at a temperature lower than that\r\nin which the plants have been reared. Hill considered that \"This is\r\nprobably due to the juices stagnating in the clusters of fibres, and to\r\nthe contraction of the bark by cold.\" His explanation of the response\r\nto the contact stimulus is of course quite wrong; it may, however, be\r\nquoted as an illustration of the view, current at that time, that such\r\nmotion was due to the fibres which acted like those of muscle. \"The\r\nvibration of the parts is that which keeps the leaves of the sensitive\r\nplant in their expanded and elevated state: this is owing to a delicate\r\nmotion continued through every fibre of them. When we touch the leaf,\r\nwe give it another motion more violent than the first: this overcomes\r\nthe first: the vibration is stopped by the rude shock: and the leaves\r\nclose, and their foot stalks fall, because that vibrating motion is\r\ndestroyed, which kept them elevated and expanded.... That the power of\r\nmotion in the sensitive plant depends upon the effect of light on the\r\nexpanded surface of the leaves, is certain; for till they are expanded,\r\nthey have no such power. The young leaves, even when grown to half an\r\ninch in length have no motion on the touch, tho' rough and sudden.\"\r\n\r\nHill fully appreciated the importance of comparative observations; he\r\ncompared the movements, in response to light, of _Abrus_ and _Mimosa_,\r\nwhich plants he placed side by side so that the conditions of the\r\nexperiment might be the same for each. He found that \"In these and\r\nin all others, the degree of elevation or expansion in the lobes,\r\nis exactly proportional to the quality of the light: and is solely\r\ndependent upon it.\"\r\n\r\nReference also may be made to Hill's views on reproduction[78]; he\r\nconsidered that the pollen grain contained the embryo which was set\r\nfree by the bursting of the grain after it had been deposited upon\r\nthe stigma. The stigmatic hairs or papillae were supposed to be the\r\nends of tubes into which the embryos entered, made their way into the\r\nplacenta, and thus arrived into the \"shells of the seeds\" (the ovules).\r\nIt is unnecessary to point out the absurdities of these ideas, but it\r\nmay be mentioned that Hill's interpretations of his observations were\r\nat fault rather than the observations themselves. Thus, judging from\r\nhis figures, he saw the contents of the pollen grain, the appearance of\r\nwhich, under the conditions of observation, might easily suggest the\r\nidea of an embryo. Also he noticed that the pollen grains burst in a\r\nlittle while when placed in water, a phenomenon which was rediscovered\r\n138 years later[79], and he therefore thought that a similar bursting,\r\nwith a consequent setting free of the embryo, would take place on the\r\nwet stigma of the lily, for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Taxonomy._\r\n\r\nOne of Hill's more interesting works in this branch of Botany is his\r\n_British Herbal_[80]. In it are described a large number of plants\r\nwhich are illustrated by 75 copper plates engraved by various artists.\r\nNone of these plates are of outstanding excellence, indeed many of\r\nthem are very poor, and their quality is uneven. Those in the folio\r\nconsulted by the present writer were ruined by being coloured.\r\n\r\nThe plants described are arranged on a system which is not altogether\r\nwithout interest as it, in a small degree, foreshadows later systems.\r\nIt may be indicated by giving the characters of the first four classes.\r\n\r\n  Class 1. Plants whose flower consists of several petals, with\r\n  numerous threads in the center, and is followed by a cluster of\r\n  naked seeds.\r\n\r\n  Class 2. Plants whose flower consists of several petals, with\r\n  numerous threads in the center, and whose seeds are contained in\r\n  several pods.\r\n\r\n  Class 3. Plants whose flower consists of a single petal, and is\r\n  succeeded by several capsules.\r\n\r\n  Class 4. Plants with the flower formed of a single petal, plain,\r\n  and of a regular form and succeeded by a single capsule.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Hill relied much on the characters of the corolla\r\nand the gynaeceum. But the chief interest in this work is, perhaps,\r\nHill's criticisms of Linnaeus. One example will suffice; Linnaeus is\r\ncriticised for placing _Myosurus_ among the pentandria polygynia and\r\nthus separating it from _Ranunculus_, _Adonis_, etc. Hill remarked that\r\nthus to separate these plants merely because the number of stamens in\r\n_Myosurus_ is less than in _Ranunculus_ is unreasonable since they\r\nagree in all other essentials. He himself, however, made a similar\r\nerror, for it will be observed that in the system followed in the\r\nHerbal, _Ranunculus_ falls into the first class and _Helleborus_ into\r\nthe second.\r\n\r\nThese criticisms of Linnaeus, however, are not all of an adverse\r\nnature; in many places Hill does not stint his praise; and he does\r\nnot fail, after describing each Genus, to mention its position in the\r\nLinnaean System.\r\n\r\nPulteney[81] found it difficult \"to reconcile the praises this author\r\nbestows on Linnaeus, in many of his writings, with the censures\r\ncontained in his British Herbal.\" The difficulty is not very apparent;\r\nHill sufficiently indicated his position in the following passage taken\r\nfrom the _Sleep of Plants_. \"If our opinions have differed, 'tis upon\r\na single Point; your arrangement of plants. In regard to that much\r\ngreater article, the establishing their distinctions, and ascertaining\r\ntheir characters, I have always admired and reverenced you: to dispute\r\nyour determinations there, were to deny the characters of nature.\r\n\r\n\"Free in the tribute of applause on this head, I have on the other been\r\nas open in my censures; equally uninfluenced by envy, and by fear. It\r\nis thus science may be advanced; and you will permit me to say, thus\r\nmen of candour should treat one another.\"\r\n\r\nLinnaeus is also criticised in the _Vegetable System_, more\r\nparticularly for his unnecessary introduction of new names for plants;\r\nbut here again Hill is full of praises for Linnaeus's descriptions of\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nAlthough opposed to the Linnaean system Hill recognised its value as\r\na means of evolving order out of chaos, and to him falls the credit\r\nof introducing it into England. Its first introduction was in his\r\n_History of Plants_ (1751), but it was unsatisfactory since the\r\n_Species Plantarum_ was not published until 1753. Hill next explained\r\nit in 1758[82], but it was not until two years later that the first\r\n_British Flora_, arranged on this system, appeared[83]. According to\r\nPulteney[84], Hill performed this task \"in a manner so unworthy of\r\nhis abilities, that his work can have no claim to the merit of having\r\nanswered the occasion: and thus the credit of the atchievement fell to\r\nthe lot of Mr William Hudson F.R.S.\"\r\n\r\nMention has been made of Hill's _Vegetable System_[85]: a work which\r\nconsists of 26 folio volumes and was undertaken at the suggestion\r\nof Lord Bute. It was commenced in 1759, and the date of the last\r\nvolume is 1775, the year of Hill's death. No expense was spared in\r\nits production, the paper is of the best, and there are 1600 plates:\r\nwith regard to these the title-page of the work states that they were\r\ndesigned and engraved by the author, but it appears from other sources\r\nthat they cost four guineas each to engrave, and since it is stated\r\non the auctioneer's announcement of the sale of the copyright (1782),\r\ntogether with some of the original drawings and the remaining sets,\r\nthat the engravings were made by the best masters under the immediate\r\nsupervision of the author, it must be concluded that Hill was not\r\nthe actual engraver although he may have made the original drawings.\r\nAttention is drawn to this point, since it casts some doubts as to\r\nwhether Hill engraved those plates, signed by him, illustrating some of\r\nhis other works, for instance, _The British Herbal_, and _A Method of\r\nProducing Double Flowers from Single_[86], of which some are very good\r\nindeed, and, if Hill were the engraver, shew that he had considerable\r\nartistic and technical ability. Naturally the plates in the _Vegetable\r\nSystem_ are of uneven quality, some are very good and not only are\r\npleasing from the artistic point of view, but also give a concrete\r\nidea of the plants represented. It is impossible here to criticize\r\nthis work in detail; but some idea of its scope may be given. The\r\nfirst volume and part of the second is concerned with the history of\r\nBotany; the origin of Systematic Botany; the Systems of Caesalpinus,\r\nMorison, Ray, Tournefort, Boerhaave, Linnaeus, and others; morphology,\r\nanatomy, physiology; and the effect of heat, light, air, soil and water\r\non vegetation. The rest of the work is occupied by descriptions of\r\nplants, both British and foreign, when the latter, the native country\r\nis mentioned; in all cases the medicinal properties are given.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to remark that notwithstanding the price of the\r\nwork, 38 guineas plain and 160 guineas coloured, Hill lost considerably\r\nover its publication. From Mrs Hill's account[87], it appears that\r\nBute undertook that Hill's circumstances should not be injured by the\r\nventure, an undertaking which was not kept; and further, after the\r\ndeath of Hill, Bute refused to compensate Mrs Hill for the unfinished\r\nlast volume or to take the materials which had accumulated for it out\r\nof her hands. Allowing some discount for the natural exaggeration of\r\na bereaved lady suffering from a grievance, there appears but little\r\ndoubt that the Earl of Bute proved lacking in good faith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConsidered as a systematist there can be no doubt that Hill knew his\r\nplants; and although the systematists of the period were overshadowed\r\nby Linnaeus, Hill preserved his independence of thought, and did not\r\nhesitate to express his opinions when they differed from those of\r\nhis great contemporary. Although he highly appreciated the work of\r\nLinnaeus he disliked his system of classification on account of its\r\nartificiality, and he intended to bring forward a natural system of\r\nhis own. It is not, I think, too much to say that time has justified\r\nhis criticism; and many of his minor differences have been warranted.\r\nFor instance, Linnaeus merged the genera _Valerianella_ and _Linaria_\r\ninto those of _Valeriana_ and _Antirrhinum_ respectively; Hill however\r\nrecognized the generic rank of the two former[88].\r\n\r\nIncidentally, it may be remarked that the acceptance of the year 1753\r\nas the starting-point for the citation of names by the Vienna Botanical\r\nCongress has been the cause of more general recognition of Hill's\r\nactivity in this direction; thus in recent editions of _British Flora_\r\nhis name is appended to many genera and species[89].\r\n\r\nThe _Vegetable System_ gained Hill the Order of Vasa, from the King\r\nof Sweden, in 1774, so that he styled himself Sir John; he was also a\r\nMember of the Imperial Academy, and a Fellow of the Royal Academy of\r\nSciences, Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nHill died of gout on the 21st of November, 1775, at about the age of\r\n59, in Golden Square, and was buried at Denham. Notwithstanding the\r\nlarge sums of money he had made, he died heavily in debt owing to the\r\ngreat expense entailed by the publication of the _Vegetable System_ and\r\nhis own personal extravagance. His library was sold in 1776-7, and it\r\nhas already been mentioned that the copyright of the _Vegetable System_\r\nwas disposed of by auction.\r\n\r\nIt is always a matter of difficulty to appraise a man's character, and\r\nmore particularly is this true of Hill whose character, as Whiston[90]\r\nhas truly remarked, was so \"mixed that none but himself can be his\r\nparallel.\" In the _Sleep of Plants_ the following passage occurs:\r\n\"There is a freedom of style, and assumed manner peculiar to this kind\r\nof correspondence, which would be too assuming in works addressed\r\nimmediately to the public; and might not unnaturally draw upon the\r\nauthor a censure of self-sufficiency and vanity. This explanation, I\r\nhope, will defend me from so unfair a charge: for indeed no one knows\r\nmore the narrow limits of human knowledge; or entertains an humbler\r\nopinion of the returns of years of application.\" Nothing could be more\r\nproper than this, but against it must be set the opinion of men of his\r\nown time, as expressed in the quotation on p. 88, taken from Baker's\r\n_Biographica Dramatica_.\r\n\r\nMany estimates of the character of Hill have been put forward, the\r\nfirst of any authority being that of Johnson[91]:--\"The King then\r\nasked him what he thought of Dr Hill. Johnson answered, that he was an\r\ningenious man, but had no veracity; and immediately mentioned, as an\r\ninstance of it, an assertion of that writer, that he had seen objects\r\nmagnified to a much greater degree by using three or four microscopes\r\nat a time than by using one. 'Now,' added Johnson, 'everyone acquainted\r\nwith microscopes knows, that the more of them he looks through,\r\nthe less the object will appear.'... 'I now,' said Johnson to his\r\nfriends, when relating what had passed, 'began to consider that I was\r\ndepreciating the man in the estimation of his sovereign, and thought\r\nit was time for me to say something that might be more favourable.' He\r\nadded, therefore, that Dr Hill was, notwithstanding, a very curious\r\nobserver; and if he would have been contented to tell the world no more\r\nthan he knew, he might have been a very considerable man, and needed\r\nnot to have recourse to such mean expedients to raise his reputation.\"\r\n\r\nIf Hill's reputation for lying rests on no surer foundation than this,\r\nhe must be held acquitted of much that is charged him. In the above\r\nquotation the term microscopes must be read lenses; thus Johnson's\r\nreason for his opinion is unfortunate and clearly shews, as Bishop\r\nElrington has remarked, that Johnson was talking of things he knew\r\nnothing about. This is the more to be regretted since the opinion of\r\na man of Johnson's rank, who was contemporary with Hill, might have\r\nbiassed the judgment of smaller and later men.\r\n\r\nAccording to Fitzgerald[92], Hill was a \"quack and blustering\r\nadventurer,\" the \"Holloway of his day,\" endowed with \"cowardice that\r\nseemed a disease.\" This author is, I think, prejudiced, and his\r\nestimate appears to be based upon the least creditable of Hill's\r\nperformances without giving a proper value to the better side of his\r\nnature and work. On the other hand the author--a grateful patient--of\r\nthe short account of the life of Hill[93] went to the other extreme.\r\nThis account is entirely laudatory, and describes Hill as being little\r\nshort of a genius surrounded and continually attacked by \"envious and\r\nmalevolent persons\" who \"did not fail to make use of every engine\r\nmalevolence could invent, to depreciate the character and the works of\r\na man, whom they saw, with regret, every way so far their superior.\"\r\n\r\nDisraeli[94] speaks of Hill as the \"Cain of Literature,\" and, whilst\r\nbeing fully alive to his \"egregious egotism\" and other defects of\r\ncharacter, he appreciates his worth and recognizes that Hill was born\r\nfifty years too soon. Also he gives him credit for his moral courage in\r\nenduring \"with undiminished spirit the most biting satires, the most\r\nwounding epigrams, and more palpable castigations.\"\r\n\r\nThe general consensus of opinion, much of which does not appear to have\r\nbeen independently arrived at, is that Hill's nature contained little\r\nthat was commendable. At the same time his remarkable industry and\r\nversatility were recognised. His independent and quarrelsome nature,\r\ncoupled with his mode of attack and fearlessness in expressing his\r\nopinions, made him cordially hated, and caused much that he did to be\r\nviewed with a prejudiced eye; for instance, it is generally stated that\r\nhe obtained his degree of Doctor of Medicine (St Andrews, 1750) by\r\ndishonourable means. Mr Anderson, Librarian and Keeper of the Records\r\nof St Andrews University, has kindly looked the matter up and informs\r\nme that there is nothing whatever to warrant such a statement; the\r\ndegree was granted according to the practice of the time.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that Hill in his earlier days suffered\r\nmuch from penury, which, to a certain extent, may have embittered his\r\nnature. However this may be, he learnt subsequently the advantages\r\nconferred by a good income, and was not desirous of becoming\r\nreacquainted with his earlier experiences. This may explain much of his\r\npeculiar behaviour. Disraeli[95] suggests that, in offering himself\r\nas Keeper of the Sloane Collection, at the time of its purchase for\r\nthe British Museum, Hill was merely indulging in an advertisement.\r\nHill probably was sufficiently shrewd to realize that a ready sale for\r\nhis wares would obtain so long as he kept within the public eye, and\r\nmuch of his extraordinary behaviour in public may have been merely\r\nself-advertisement.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Hill prefacing this sketch is after Neudramini's\r\nengraving of Coates's portrait (1757); the plant represented is a spray\r\nof a species of _Hillia_, named in honour of Hill by Jacquin.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[59] Sir John Hawkins, _Life of Samuel Johnson_, London. 1787.\r\n\r\n[60] A Letter from Henry Woodward, ... to Dr Hill ...

A cryptic utterance, savouring perhaps of a certain dash\r\nof impressionism, and not altogether false as it is assuredly not\r\nwholly true. If, however, we endeavour dispassionately to appraise the\r\nperformance of the world's great (though perhaps we should exclude\r\nthe few greatest) men we shall probably discover that the implied\r\nlimitation is justified, at least in part, by history and experience.\r\nThe fact is that hardly anyone can really penetrate far into nature's\r\nsecret places without losing his way. The virgin lands of knowledge\r\nthat lie beyond the area of contemporary possession are first invaded\r\nby those who can breach the barriers that oppose advance, for genius,\r\nby its wider outlook enables those who are endowed with it to recognise\r\nthe weaker spots in these barriers, and thus to lead the attack. But\r\nthe new territory, even after it is won, is ever surrounded by unknown\r\nregions, still waiting to be overrun when, but not until, the\r\nconditions for further expansion shall have been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate XI_ ROBERT BROWN (_circa 1856_)]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century the time was ripe for such\r\nan addition of new territory to the regions of Botany already occupied\r\nat that period. In England, at any rate, the work inaugurated by Ray\r\nand others had become overshadowed by the authority of Linnaeus, and\r\neven on the Continent the effective advance of the science was for\r\nvarious reasons almost stayed. It is true that in France the Jussieus\r\nhad started advance on fruitful lines, and others like De Candolle were\r\nendeavouring to feel their way through the maze of dimly comprehended\r\nrelationships, but their efforts were obscured by the growing and fatal\r\nfacilities for piling up mere catalogues of plants without the clues\r\nnecessary to direct their energies into more profitable channels. As\r\nregards the flowering plants, there was, it is true, a groping after\r\na partially perceived natural system, but the lower ranks of the\r\nvegetable kingdom formed, so far as scientific purposes were concerned,\r\na _terra incognita_, and the attempts to elucidate the morphology of\r\nthese groups in the light of the angiosperms were, as we now can see\r\nclearly enough, plainly foredoomed to failure.\r\n\r\nFacts were distorted and observations misinterpreted in ways that now\r\nseem to us almost to smack of sheer perversity, but we must not forget\r\nthat the methods which in later years have proved so effective had not\r\nthen been recognised; Hofmeister, with his marvellous genius, had not\r\nas yet arisen to shew the way through the maze of the lower forms.\r\n\r\nBut what does strike one as astonishing, or might do so if the\r\ncircumstance were not still so common, is the evidence of the\r\ndifficulty men experienced in really seeing things as they were, and\r\nof distinguishing the fundamentally important from the trivial or even\r\nirrelevant.\r\n\r\nAs always, what was needed was the man who could fix his gaze on facts,\r\nwho would spare no pains to find out what was true, and thus succeed\r\nin discovering a sure base to serve as a vantage ground for further\r\nadvance. Von Mohl was one of these, and earlier in the century there\r\nwas the man, the subject of this lecture, who by his single-hearted\r\nsearch after truth, and the extraordinary ardour and ability with\r\nwhich he prosecuted his investigations will always occupy a high\r\nposition in the history of Botany.\r\n\r\nRobert Brown came of a stock which refused to bow the knee to\r\nauthority, though his forbears did not, any more than himself, hesitate\r\nto impress the weight of it on others. His father was a non-juring\r\nclergyman of Montrose, and was in consequence obliged to leave the\r\nofficial ecclesiastical fold. But he carried a congregation with him,\r\nand not desiring to set up novel forms of church government, managed to\r\nget himself consecrated bishop of the new flock. As bishop, priest and\r\ndeacon, _tres in uno juncti_, he ministered to his Edinburgh church,\r\nand his episcopal staff may still be seen in the rooms of the Linnean\r\nSociety. His son Robert, who was born in 1773, inherited both his\r\nfather's independence and also his dominant character. And, indeed, the\r\ngreat influence he wielded in the botanical world was due in no small\r\ndegree to his strong personality, reinforced as it was by his high\r\nscientific attainments.\r\n\r\nHe began at an early age to evince a love of botany and to give proof\r\nof the strong critical faculty which enabled him so successfully to\r\nsolve the problems he attacked, and so materially to advance our\r\nscience. He added to his mental attainments a wonderfully methodical\r\nhabit, and the diary of his earlier years reveals him to us not only as\r\na hard-working student but as one meticulously accurate in detail.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 he was appointed Surgeon mate to the Fifeshire Regiment of\r\nFencibles, and his letter of appointment signed by the Colonel, James\r\nDurham, is preserved in the Natural History Museum. His regiment was\r\nquartered in Ireland, and he made good use of his time, collecting all\r\nthe plants he could get hold of, including mosses and liverworts, of\r\nwhich he amassed a considerable collection. Indeed, it is said that he\r\nowed his first acquaintance with Sir Joseph Banks to his discovery in\r\nIreland of the rare moss _Glyphomitrium Daviesii_. This recognition\r\nby Sir Joseph proved the turning-point of his life. The six years or\r\nso that he spent in the Fencibles were turned to good account, and in\r\nlooking to his own record of his life during those years one realises\r\nhow thoroughly he earned the success that crowned his work in after\r\nlife. There is much humour--perhaps of an unconscious kind, though I am\r\nnot very sure that it was so very unconscious--in his carefully kept\r\ndiary. Here is an extract, dated Feb. 7, 1800.\r\n\r\n  Before breakfast began the German auxiliary verbs.\r\n\r\n  Committed to memory a genus in Cullen's Synopsis. Described\r\n  Polytrichum aloides--to be compared with Mr Menzies' P. rubellum.\r\n\r\n  Began the description of Osmunda pellucida.\r\n\r\n  Hospital usual time.\r\n\r\n  Took exactly the same walk as on the 4th. Blasia pusilla Lin.,\r\n  Weissia recurvirostra Hedw.? Dicranum varium Hedw., Polytrichum\r\n  nanum, Polytrichum urnigerum, Phascum subulatum, Dicranum glaucum,\r\n  absque fruct.\r\n\r\n  At dinner about 3 pints of port., remained in the mess room till\r\n  about 9 or 10 o'clock--slept in my chair till nearly 3 in the\r\n  morning.\r\n\r\n  Feb. 8, before breakfast finished the auxiliary verb _Seyn_, to be,\r\n  in Wendeborn's German Grammar....\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, spend all his evenings in this fashion, but\r\nwhether it was a glass of water, a pint of porter, or what not, it\r\nis all gravely set down, together with the work he succeeded in\r\naccomplishing. Instances of his thoroughness are not wanting. He says\r\nin one place he had read Nicholson's _Chemistry_, ch. vi., on the\r\nbalance, \"to be again perused, my defective knowledge of the mechanical\r\npowers rendering part of it unintelligible.\"\r\n\r\nHe was fond of reading in bed, but his light literature on\r\nthese occasions included such works as Adam Smith, Blackstone's\r\n_Commentaries_, and a German Grammar.\r\n\r\nHis botanical acquirements were already attracting notice, and in 1798,\r\nbeing detached for recruiting service, he took the opportunity of a\r\nvisit to London to utilise the splendid collections in the possession\r\nof Sir Joseph Banks, and he was also in the same year elected an\r\nAssociate of the Linnean Society. Soon after his return to Ireland\r\nhe received a letter from Sir Joseph offering him the nomination as\r\nNaturalist to the _Investigator_, which was to be commanded by Captain\r\nFlinders. He at once decided to go, writing, as he tells us, by return\r\nof post.\r\n\r\nFew men who have, at so early an age, enjoyed the opportunity of a\r\nvoyage of discovery were so well equipped for the work as was Robert\r\nBrown. Blessed with a good constitution, which was also seaworthy,\r\nhe possessed many physical advantages, but in addition to them he had\r\ntrained himself as an accurate and accomplished botanist. He spent what\r\ntime he could spare in London in acquainting himself with all that he\r\ncould find of the New Holland Flora, and in this connection he had full\r\naccess to the invaluable Banksian collections.\r\n\r\nHe was fortunate in having with him on the expedition as draughtsman\r\nFerdinand Bauer, whose beautiful drawings are the admiration of all who\r\nknow them.\r\n\r\nThe _Investigator_ sailed from Portsmouth in 1801, and on landing at\r\nKing George's Sound the first collections, amounting to about 500\r\nplants, were made within three weeks. Three days at Lucky Bay yielded\r\n100 species not met with in the previous locality. At Port Jackson\r\nthe _Investigator_ was condemned as unseaworthy, and Captain Flinders\r\ndetermined to return to England to obtain another ship in which to\r\nprosecute the expedition. The ship, however, was wrecked in Torres\r\nStraits, Brown's duplicate specimens, as well as the live plants on\r\nboard, being lost, whilst Captain Flinders was held prisoner by the\r\nFrench at Port Louis. Meantime Brown and Bauer continued their travels\r\nin Australia, visiting Van Dieman's land as well. Brown subsequently\r\nreturned to England, oddly enough in the old _Investigator_, in 1805\r\nwith a magnificent collection of plants some 4000 in number.\r\n\r\nHe did not merely _collect_, but he studied his collections on the\r\nspot--a method that may be strongly commended to young men who go\r\nout as botanists at the present time. His plan was to keep a working\r\nherbarium of all the plants gathered by him, as he went along, and he\r\nwrote up the descriptions in great part during his actual expeditions.\r\nIn this way many problems formulated themselves which he was able\r\neither to investigate on the spot, or else to lay up additional\r\nmaterial for further investigation at leisure. Thus the methodical ways\r\nof dealing with the plants collected in earlier years at home stood\r\nhim in good stead at a time when the opportunities of a lifetime were\r\ncrowding upon him.\r\n\r\nOn his return to England he was appointed librarian to the Linnean\r\nSociety (1805), an office which he held till 1822, and he at once set\r\nabout to utilise the vast resources which were now at his command.\r\n\r\nHe contributed to the narrative of The Flinders Expedition an account\r\nof the vegetation of New Holland. The essay is a remarkable one, not\r\nonly for the masterly descriptions of the principal genera and orders\r\nwhich it contains, and the critical remarks which are scattered through\r\nthe pages, but also for the geographical and statistical methods of\r\ntreatment which he introduced. Many of the orders are new, and Brown\r\nshews his striking perception of affinity not only in his general\r\ndiscussion of the subject as a whole, but also in the definitions of\r\nthe new orders and genera which he founded. This soundness of judgment\r\nis shewn on a still larger scale in his more definitely systematic\r\nworks such as the _Prodromus_, but one may regard it generally as an\r\nastonishing tribute to his sagacity that very few of the groups founded\r\nby him have needed serious revision, even when further discoveries\r\nmade it possible for later botanists to fill up the lacunae inevitable\r\nduring those earlier days.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1810 there appeared the first volume of his great work, the\r\n_Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae_. It is a misfortune that only one\r\nvolume was ever published, although the work was advanced in MS. It has\r\nbeen said that a criticism of the author's Latinity at the hands of a\r\nreviewer was the cause of the stoppage of the publication, but there\r\nseems to be no real foundation for the story. Possibly the expense,\r\ncoupled with the small return, may at any rate partly account for it.\r\nBe this as it may, Brown recalled from his bookseller all the unsold\r\ncopies, and in the copy preserved at the Natural History Museum there\r\nis a list of the volumes actually sold written by Brown himself, and\r\nfrom a financial point of view the enterprise clearly proved itself to\r\nbe an expensive experiment. The volume as published is a remarkable\r\nwork, containing some 450 pages, including 464 genera, nearly one-third\r\nof which are here described for the first time and the number of\r\nspecies amounts to about 2000, some three-quarters of which were new to\r\nscience. Add to this the fact that the flora as a whole is very unlike\r\nthat of the northern hemisphere, also that the work was accomplished\r\nwith such amazing rapidity (largely owing to his particular methods\r\nalready alluded to), and one cannot withhold admiration at the energy\r\nand the learning of its author. It is a wonderful tribute to his wisdom\r\nthat his descriptions and arrangements should have so stood the test\r\nof 100 years, during which time vast strides in our knowledge of the\r\nAustralian and other floras have been made. But the lapse of time has\r\nresulted in scarcely any but trifling modifications of the general\r\nresults as he left them. The _Prodromus_ is well worth study, for in\r\nits pages one constantly meets with hints of observations which have\r\nborne fruit in later years. Some of them, indeed, e.g. his observations\r\non Cycads, were expanded by himself into larger treatises in which much\r\nlight has been thrown on morphological and taxonomic relationships\r\npreviously but imperfectly understood.\r\n\r\nThe year before the publication of the _Prodromus_, Brown communicated\r\nto the Linnean Society an excellent and learned memoir on the\r\nProteaceae. In this paper we encounter an instance of that whimsical\r\nintroduction of observations exceedingly valuable in themselves, but\r\nmainly irrelevant to the matter in hand, which is a characteristic\r\nfeature of many of his works. Perhaps it was due to the intense\r\nkeenness with which he always followed up problems that interested him,\r\nso that, like Mr Dick's weakness for King Charles' head, they had to\r\nfind a place in whatever else he was writing about. Thus his treatise\r\non the Proteaceae starts off with advice to study the flower in the\r\nyoung, instead of only in its adult condition, and this is driven home\r\nby an excellent disquisition on the structure of the androecium and\r\ngynaeceum of Asclepiads, a subject which occupied his mind for some\r\nyears and formed the basis for separate papers at subsequent periods.\r\nOnly when he has discussed the morphology of the Asclepiad flower\r\ndoes he plunge, abruptly, into the questions relating directly to the\r\nProteaceae.\r\n\r\nLater on in the same year (1809) he read a masterly paper on the\r\nAsclepiadaceae which was subsequently printed in the _Memoirs_ of\r\nthe Wernerian Natural History Society. This Natural Order was here\r\nseparated by him from the Apocynaceae, from which it had not previously\r\nbeen distinguished, and a correct account of the relations of the\r\nremarkable androecium, so characteristic of the Asclepiad flower,\r\nwas given. Twenty-two years later (in 1831) he again returned to the\r\nAsclepiads and described and discussed the mode of pollination and\r\nfertilisation in this Order and also in that of the Orchids.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of Brown that he clung with great tenacity to\r\nany problem that had once excited his interest. He made himself fully\r\nacquainted with the work of his contemporaries and predecessors, and\r\nat the same time he constantly attacked it by reiterated first-hand\r\ninvestigations, testing hypotheses and theories by the light of direct\r\nobservation. He was very cautious, and thus, although he traced\r\nthe pollen tubes from the pollen grain into the ovary and into the\r\nmicropyle (foramen) of the ovule, he still leaves it an open question\r\nwhether, in all cases, anything of a material nature passes from the\r\npollen to the interior of the ovule, which may thus be held responsible\r\nfor the formation of an embryo.\r\n\r\nHe cites the observations of Amici and of Du Petit Thouars, and then\r\nstates he does not feel he is as far advanced as these observers. But\r\nin the succeeding pages he traces the tube, of which he says, \"the\r\nproduction is a vital action excited in the grain by the application\r\nof an external stimulus.\" We see here a clear perception of the facts\r\nof germination and of the operation of what we now call chemiotaxis,\r\nfor he goes on to add \"The appropriate and most powerful stimulus\r\nto this action is no doubt contact, at the proper period, with the\r\nsecretion or surface of the stigma of the same species. Many facts,\r\nhowever, and among others the existence of hybrid plants, prove that\r\nthis is not the only stimulus capable of producing the effect; and in\r\nOrchideae I have found that the action in the pollen of one species\r\nmay be excited by the stigma of another belonging to a very different\r\ntribe.\" It is hard to believe that these lines were written so long\r\nas 80 years ago. Brown goes on to describe the change that follows\r\nimpregnation, and the gradual appearance of the embryo. And we must\r\nremember that all these observations were made by one who relied almost\r\nexclusively on the simple microscope and the simplest--I had almost\r\nsaid barbaric--technique.\r\n\r\nHe expresses himself in very reserved terms as to the nature of the\r\n\"immediate agent derived from the male organ, or the manner of its\r\napplication to the ovulum in the production of that series of changes\r\nconstituting fecundation.\" But he puts forward the opinion that a more\r\nattentive examination of the process in Orchids and Asclepiads is more\r\nlikely to be fruitful of results than most other families.\r\n\r\nHe returns again to this matter of fecundation in the following year,\r\nstudying several orchids, but especially _Bonatea_, for the purpose.\r\nHe is somewhat shaken as to the validity of his former inferences,\r\nand concludes that the \"mucous cords\" (i.e. strings of pollen tubes)\r\nare perhaps derived from pollen \"not, however, by mere elongation of\r\nthe original pollen tubes, but by an increase in their number, in a\r\nmanner which I do not attempt to explain.\" In this later paper he also\r\nhazards the suggestion that in _Ophrys_, as impregnation is frequently\r\naccomplished without the aid of insects, \"... it may be conjectured\r\nthat the remarkable forms of the flowers in this genus are intended to\r\ndeter, not to attract, insects.\" Also he suggests that the insect forms\r\nin orchidaceous flowers resemble those of the insects belonging to the\r\nnative country of the plants. This is a clear foreshadowing of what\r\nis now called protective mimicry--and the former suggestion is not at\r\nany rate wholly without modern supporters, though Brown's share in its\r\norigin seems not to be generally recognised.\r\n\r\nThe keen desire to get to the bottom of a problem, which was so\r\noutstanding a feature of Brown's whole mental attitude, unquestionably\r\nexplains why he was led to make so many important discoveries in\r\nsuch widely different directions. His first hand knowledge of the\r\nstructure of a vast number of plants gave a soundness and depth to\r\nhis morphological investigations that must arouse the admiration of\r\neveryone who is acquainted with them. He was never satisfied with\r\nperfunctory attempts to solve a problem, but, as we have already\r\nseen, in the example of his studies on Asclepiads and Orchids, he\r\nwould return again and again to the matter till he had satisfied\r\nhimself of the accuracy of his work. It is a pity that all of the\r\npresent day botanists do not follow more closely in his steps in\r\nthis respect. Publication of a paper seems to some to be a matter of\r\ngreater importance than the advance of knowledge by the scientific\r\nand scholarly solution of a problem. Such was not Brown's view, and\r\nhe practised wise delay in publication--_nonumque prematur in annum_,\r\na maxim so strongly advocated by the Latin poet, was really put into\r\npractice by him as it also was by some of his contemporaries. Dryander,\r\nSolander and others have left, as Brown has done, rich stores of MS.\r\nbehind them, which have never passed through the press.\r\n\r\nThe habit of long and continuous reflection on fundamental problems,\r\nwhich was so marked a feature of Brown's character, was perhaps\r\nresponsible for the curious manner in which some of his most valuable\r\nand suggestive contributions to science, and especially to morphology,\r\nwere given to the world, a habit to which I have already adverted.\r\n\r\nWe know he had been for many years interested in the ovule, and he made\r\na number of important discoveries respecting it. Closely bound up with\r\nthis topic were his studies on the Cycads and Conifers. He observed the\r\nplurality of embryos in the seeds of these plants, and, indeed, makes\r\na reference to the phenomenon of polyembryony in the _Prodromus_, in\r\nwhich, as in most of his systematic works, morphological observations\r\nof the highest value are scattered, though embodied in very compressed\r\nphrases, amongst the descriptions of species. But every now and then\r\nwhen writing on one subject he seems to be carried away with the rush\r\nof his ideas on general questions. Thus in a memoir on the genus\r\n_Kingia_ he entitles the paper, possibly to save his face after he had\r\nwritten it, \"Character and Description of Kingia; a new genus of plants\r\nfound on the south-west coast of New Holland. With observations on the\r\nStructure of its unimpregnated Ovulum, and on the female flower of\r\nCycadeae and Coniferae.\"\r\n\r\nThis paper is, perhaps, one of the most important of his works, for it\r\nwas there that, having briefly dismissed the genus _Kingia_, he \"let\r\nhimself go\" on the ovule, and then in a masterly dissertation, puts\r\nforward his view on the gymnospermic nature of the Cycads and Conifers.\r\n\r\nHe summarises what was known at that time as to the structure of\r\nthe ovule, acutely criticising the views of the various authors he\r\ncites. He emphasises the need of studying the _development_ in order\r\nsuccessfully to interpret the mature structure. He insists on the\r\norigin of the seed coats from the integuments, on the orientation of\r\nthe embryo within the amnios (embryo sac), and on the distinction\r\nbetween the true albumen which is contained in this \"amnios\" and the\r\nalbumen \"formed by a deposition of granular matter in the cells of the\r\nnucleus\" (nucellus), i.e. the perisperm, and he goes on to suggest\r\nthat in some of these cases the \"Membrane of the amnios seems to\r\nbe persistent, forming even in the ripe seed a proper coat for the\r\nembryo.... This is the probable explanation of the structure of true\r\nNympheaceae\" ... here he seems to have overlooked the rudimentary\r\nendosperm which is really present. Finally he sums up an admirable\r\naccount of the whole matter as follows:--\"The albumen, properly\r\nso-called, may be formed either by a disposition or secretion of\r\ngranular matter in the utriculi of the amnios, or in those of the\r\nnucleus itself, or lastly that two substances having these distinct\r\norigins and very different textures may coexist in the ripe seed as is\r\nprobably the case in Scitamineae.\"\r\n\r\nHe then goes on at once to argue that the apex of the nucleus is the\r\npoint of the ovulum where impregnation takes place, and adds that\r\n\"all doubt would be removed if cases could be produced where the\r\novarium was either altogether wanting or so imperfectly formed that\r\nthe ovulum itself became directly exposed to the action of the pollen\r\nor its fovilla.\" This leads him at once to enunciate his view of the\r\ngymnospermy of Cycads, Conifers and Gnetaceae. He reviews very fully\r\nthe opinions that had been expressed by others as to the real structure\r\nof the female organ, especially of Pinus, and he mentions the fact that\r\nhe himself in the botany of the Flinders' voyage had previously held\r\nthe view that a minute perianth was present in the Pine, a view which,\r\nas he says, \"On reconsidering the subject in connection with what I had\r\nascertained respecting the vegetable ovulum\" he had now abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe morphology of the male sporophyll of Cycas, however, presents a\r\ngreat difficulty, and Brown, less fortunate here, discusses a number\r\nof what seemed to him possible explanations. The recognition of\r\n_Sporangia_ was remote, and the effort to homologise the numerous\r\npollen sacs either to grains of pollen which, bursting, liberated\r\nfovilla, or to male flowers, or to explain them in other ways, was\r\nnot very successful. The fact is this was a piece of morphology for\r\nwhich the age was not ready. We must recollect that the comparative\r\nmorphology of the ovule (in the wide sense) was not attempted. Brown's\r\nmain contribution to the understanding of this structure consisted\r\nin the empirical accuracy with which he elucidated the actual\r\nstructure--he made no attempt to frame a comparative morphology, for\r\nthe simple reason that in the condition of knowledge at the time no\r\nsuch comparative morphology was possible or even dreamed of.\r\n\r\nTwo other remarkable discoveries now demand our attention, and both\r\nare instructive as shewing the keenness with which his highly trained\r\npowers of observation followed up the clues which his brilliant\r\nintellect had enabled him to descry. It was while engaged on a study of\r\nthe Orchids and Asclepiads that he was led to recognise the existence\r\nof the cell nucleus. He worked almost exclusively with what we should\r\ncall a dissecting microscope. One of his instruments is preserved in\r\nthe Natural History Museum, and it is well to examine it and reflect\r\non how much may be discerned even with a very primitive instrument if\r\nonly a good brain lies behind the retina. The \"microscope\" contains a\r\nnumber of simple lenses of various powers, the highest about 1/32\" F.L.\r\nIt is easy with such an instrument to see the nucleus in the epidermal\r\ncells when one knows it is there, but to have _discovered_ it, and at\r\na time when the technique of staining, &c., was simply non-existent,\r\nwas a triumph of genius. Brown, of course, could not fully appreciate\r\nthe great importance of his discovery, but he quite realised that he\r\nwas dealing with no isolated or trivial fact, and, with characteristic\r\nindustry and enterprise, he searched many other plants to find out\r\nwhether his newly recognised nucleus was general or not; he found it to\r\nbe so, and we all know how the discovery began at once to bear fruit.\r\n\r\nA second observation to which I would refer was also of wide interest,\r\nand it was not made merely by chance. Brown was anxious to penetrate\r\nif possible into the secrets of fertilisation. He seems to have been\r\npretty sure that something more than the mere \"aura\" of older writers\r\nwas concerned in the matter, and while looking into the evidence for\r\nthe existence or transmission of material substance, he observed that\r\nin the fovilla of the pollen there were vast crowds of minute particles\r\nwhich were in a continual state of dancing motion. He hoped that it\r\nmight be possible to identify these bodies along their track into the\r\novule, and so to settle the more urgent questions as to the mode of\r\nfertilisation. He states that he made his observations with a simple\r\nmicroscope, the focal length of the lens of which was 1/32\". Later on\r\nhe used a much more powerful pocket microscope made by Dollond with\r\npower up to 1/70\" F.L. He got Dollond to check the results with a\r\ncompound achromatic microscope, and estimated the size of the particles\r\nto be 1/20,000 to 1/30,000\". Brown was fully aware that he was not\r\nthe first observer who had seen these moving particles. They had been\r\nalready noticed by Needham and by Gleichen, but these writers had\r\npaid no special attention to them. Brown's great merit in this matter\r\nlies in the admirable way in which he conducted the investigation. At\r\nfirst he thought he had lighted upon something which was essentially\r\na peculiarity of the male elements; then, extending his observations,\r\nhe had to expand his first idea and admit the \"active molecules\" to\r\nrepresent a state or condition of living matter generally. As he still\r\nfurther widened the sphere of his investigations, he proved that the\r\nsame movements occurred in dead tissues, and further that inorganic\r\nbodies also exhibited the phenomenon. Later on he found that the\r\nmovements depended on the minuteness of the particles. He excluded\r\nthe effect of evaporation, currents and other disturbing influences,\r\nand, indeed, the whole investigation shews him to us in the character\r\nof an accomplished experimenter as well as a brilliant observer. The\r\ncomplete explanation of these \"active molecules,\" which are in the\r\nstate generally described as \"Brownian movement,\" still constitutes an\r\nunsolved problem, and one finds that it even now continues to occupy\r\nthe attention of the physicist.\r\n\r\nAny attempt adequately to review the whole of Brown's life work is\r\nimpossible within the limits necessarily imposed by the conditions of\r\na lecture, and I make no pretence to completeness, but will endeavour\r\nrather to indicate what appear to be the more important of his many\r\nother contributions to science.\r\n\r\nHis catalogues of the plants collected by those associated with\r\nvarious expeditions, his Kew lists (which were published under Aiton's\r\nname) are well known to students of systematic Botany, but his fine\r\nmonograph on _Rafflesia_, containing, as it does, many observations of\r\ngeneral interest will well repay perusal even after these many years.\r\nHis studies on Cephalotus, on Caulophyllum (with its remarkable seed\r\nformation), as well as his considerable memoir on the Proteaceae,\r\nshew him as a naturalist imbued with keen insight and possessed of\r\nextraordinarily sound judgment.\r\n\r\nBut Brown did not confine his attention to phanerogams, but, as might\r\nhave been anticipated from the studies of his earlier years, pursued\r\nhis investigations into the little explored field of the cryptogams.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that as a young man he had been greatly attracted to the\r\nstudy of mosses. Later on he contributed two important papers on these\r\nplants to the Linnean Society, one in 1809, in which he described\r\ntwo new genera, one of them Dawsonia, the other Leptostomum, both\r\nfrom Australasia. The introductory remarks in which he discusses\r\nthe character of the moss capsule, are interesting as shewing how\r\nhopelessly impossible it was at that time to arrive at a scientific\r\nunderstanding of its structure, so long as everything was tested by the\r\ntouchstone of the flowering plants. Ten years afterwards he reverted to\r\nthe same subject, describing the new genus _Lyellia_ from Nepaul, and\r\ncomparing it, as was his wont, with allied genera, e.g. Polytrichum,\r\nBuxbaumia and many others, with the view of elucidating the\r\nsignificance of its structure. The spores, however, are still spoken of\r\nas seeds. The male plant is generally regarded as the _barren_ plant.\r\nIt is not easy to reconcile the existence of male flowers with the view\r\nof Beauvois which Brown seemed still to consider as not disproved, viz.\r\nthat the seeds and pollen were both contained in the capsule.\r\n\r\nMosses were not the only cryptograms to which he turned his attention.\r\nHe described a new species of Azolla (_A. pinnata_) from Port Jackson,\r\nand the plant was illustrated by the excellent drawings of Bauer. But\r\nhere, too, the time was not yet ripe for a morphological understanding\r\nof the structure. The megasporangium was thought to be the _male_\r\nflower, the microsporangia being interpreted as capsules containing\r\nseveral seeds (the glochidia). The explanation of the supposed male\r\nflower presented difficulties, but he states that the lower cell (i.e.\r\nthe megaspore) was once found filled with a powder replacing the turbid\r\nfluid ordinarily occurring there, and the powder was supposed in some\r\nway to be ejected and thence to be conveyed to the female organ.\r\n\r\nFerns also claimed his attention, and among his other contributions he\r\nfounded the genus _Woodsia_, calling attention to the character of the\r\ninvolucrum (indusium), which separated it from the other polypodia with\r\nwhich the species had previously been associated.\r\n\r\nBrown had always taken a keen interest in fossil plants, although,\r\nso far as I am aware, he only wrote one paper on the subject. This\r\none, however, was of considerable importance, for its subject was the\r\nBrownian cone of Lepidodendron, called by him Triplosporite, though its\r\ntrue affinities were correctly gauged.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as I have said, Brown was less successful when grappling\r\nwith cryptogams, he is always worth reading on any subject, and in his\r\nown special province, that of the flowering plants, I know of no one\r\namongst the older writers from whom one may learn so much. This is due\r\nnot only to the genius and erudition which he brought to bear on every\r\nproblem he attacked, but also to the example he affords of scientific\r\nmethod in handling his subject. In his respect for accuracy, in his\r\ncautious attitude, as well as in the single-minded honesty of purpose\r\nhe everywhere exhibits, he has set an example not only for his own but\r\nfor all future time.\r\n\r\nHis personal character made a deep impression on his contemporaries.\r\nTo his friends he was very faithful, and the unanimous tribute of\r\naffectionate (though respectful) admiration affords full proof of\r\nthis. Like many other strong characters, however, he seems also to\r\nhave been able at times to shew a rougher side of his nature. He was\r\nnot generous with his specimens, nor was he always ready to part with\r\ninformation. Asa Gray tells a story of how he encountered this trait\r\nof Brown's character. Gray was visiting this country and, of course,\r\nmade the great botanist's acquaintance. One day Brown told him that he\r\nknew of a character by which _Rhexia_ (a genus in which Gray was at\r\nthat time interested) could be distinguished from some nearly allied\r\nones, and that this character had escaped the notice of De Candolle and\r\nothers. But Gray could not get it out of him, and it was not till the\r\nfollowing week that Brown was induced to part with his secret!\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe the impression the elder botanist made on\r\nGray, and to note the growing admiration with which the younger man\r\nspeaks of him in the very readable diary he kept of his London visit.\r\nIt was the same, however, with all. The more intimate the acquaintance\r\nthe more profound the respect, and sometimes the love, that Brown's\r\npersonality inspired.\r\n\r\nBrown was a keen business man, and well lived up to the traditions of\r\nthe land of his birth. He gave a remarkable proof of his canniness\r\nin the successful outcome of his bargaining with the trustees of the\r\nBritish Museum. Sir Joseph Banks by his will had left him not only\r\nhis house, but also a life user of the Banksian collections, after\r\nwhich they were to go to the Museum. In 1827 Brown entered into a hard\r\nagreement with the trustees to transfer the collections at once to the\r\nMuseum, he being appointed \"under-librarian\" at an adequate salary,\r\nwith a well safeguarded position. He used commonly to take 11 weeks'\r\nholiday--a length of vacation which served to differentiate him rather\r\nclearly (and to his own advantage) from his colleagues. He successfully\r\ncountered all official moves designed to encroach on the terms of his\r\nagreement whereby his freedom might be curtailed, and his conditions of\r\nservice be brought more into line with those that obtained elsewhere in\r\nthe Museum.\r\n\r\nHe maintained through his life intimate relations with the Linnean\r\nSociety. He acted during his earlier life as Librarian to the Society,\r\nan office which he resigned in 1822. Two years previously he had\r\nsucceeded to the house in Soho Square which had been left to him by\r\nSir Joseph Banks, and as it was larger than his own requirements\r\ndemanded, an arrangement was made by which the Linnean Society moved\r\ninto the vacant rooms, where it remained for a number of years. Brown\r\nsubsequently became President of the Society (in 1849).\r\n\r\nRobert Brown was deservedly acclaimed by his contemporaries as the\r\nfirst botanist of his age, and honours fell to his share even in his\r\nearlier years. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1811,\r\nand twenty-eight years afterwards was awarded the Copley Medal. He was\r\napproached in 1819 in connection with the Chair of Botany in Edinburgh,\r\nbut decided not to sever his intimate connection with Sir Joseph Banks.\r\nAbroad he was probably more widely known than in this country, for\r\nwhen on a visit to Prussia the King sent a special carriage to meet\r\nhim, and decorated him with the Order _Pour la Mérite_. In England, on\r\nthe other hand, though held in the highest esteem by his scientific\r\n_confrères_, he shared the obscurity that was the common lot of many of\r\nthe _savants_ of that age. He was, however, awarded a civil pension,\r\nalthough not without question on the part of certain members of the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nHe lived to a ripe age, passing away in the year 1858, the 85th of his\r\nage. To the last he retained his interest in his life work, and on\r\nJune 3, a week before he died, he signed a certificate in favour of an\r\nAssociate of the Linnean Society.\r\n\r\nRobert Brown, as we have seen, penetrated more deeply than most of\r\nhis contemporaries into the secrets of nature, and he enriched the\r\nscience to which he devoted his long life by discoveries of fundamental\r\nimportance. But he, no more than others, was able to anticipate, with\r\nall his insight, the recognition of the broader bonds of coherence\r\nwhich link up the plant kingdom as a whole. That was only made possible\r\nwhen the researches of Hofmeister, the great Tübingen Professor, had\r\nbeen made known to the world. But it is no reproach to his memory or to\r\nhis reputation that he should have fallen into error when attempting\r\nto elucidate the critical stages in the life history of cryptogams.\r\nThe historical interest attaching to his mistakes lies in their\r\ninevitableness at the time when he was actively working.\r\n\r\nIt would be as ungracious as it would be futile to attempt to rob the\r\ngreat botanist of the meed of praise which by all that is right belongs\r\nto him, because he could not escape from the influence of limiting\r\nfactors. His supreme merit rests in his wonderful elucidation of the\r\nmorphology and inter-relationships of the higher plants, and if we\r\njudge him by his achievements in this field we shall hardly disagree\r\nwith v. Humboldt in according to him the title of _Facile Botanicorum\r\nprinceps, Britanniae gloria et ornamentum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM HOOKER\r\n\r\n1785-1865\r\n\r\nBY F. O. BOWER\r\n\r\n  Early pursuits--appointed to Glasgow--Garden\r\n  administration--teaching methods--appointed Director of\r\n  Kew--state of Botany--vigorous development of Kew--serial\r\n  publications--floristic work--descriptive work on Ferns--his record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Poeta nascitur non fit.\" A poet is born, not made. If this be true of\r\npoets, much more is it true of botanists. The man who takes up botany\r\nmerely as a means of making a livelihood, rarely possesses that true\r\nspirit of the naturalist which is essential for the highest success in\r\nthe Science. It is the boys who are touched with the love of organic\r\nNature from their earliest years, who grub about hedgerows and woods,\r\nand by a sort of second sight appear to know instinctively, as personal\r\nfriends, the things of the open country, who provide the material from\r\nwhich our little band of workers may best be recruited.\r\n\r\nSuch a boy was Sir William Hooker, the subject of this lecture. He\r\nwas born in 1785, at Norwich. There is no detailed history of his\r\nboyhood, but it is known that in his school days he interested himself\r\nin entomology, in drawing, and in reading books of natural history, a\r\nrather unusual thing at the time of the Napoleonic wars! In 1805, when\r\nhe was at the age of 20, he discovered a species new to Britain, in\r\n_Buxbaumia aphylla_, and his correspondence about it with Dawson Turner\r\nshows that he was already well versed not only in the flowering plants,\r\nbut also in the Mosses, Hepaticae, Lichens, and fresh-water Algae of\r\nNorfolk, his native county. Three years later Sir James Smith dedicated\r\nto him the new genus _Hookeria_, styling him as \"a most assiduous\r\nand intelligent botanist, already well known by his interesting\r\ndiscovery of _Buxbaumia aphylla_, as well as by his scientific drawings\r\nof Fuci for Mr Turner's work: and likely to be far more distinguished\r\nby his illustrations of the difficult genus _Jungermannia_, to which he\r\nhas given particular attention\" (_Trans. Linn. Soc._ IX. 275). Clearly\r\nyoung Hooker was a convinced naturalist in his early years, and that by\r\ninner impulse rather than by the mere force of circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate XII_ WILLIAM JACKSON HOOKER (1834)]\r\n\r\nNot that the circumstances of his early years were in any way against\r\nhis scientific tastes. He inherited a competence at the early age of\r\nfour, and so was saved the mere struggle of bread-winning. His father\r\nwas personally interested in gardening, while from his mother's side\r\nhe inherited a taste for drawing. Moreover, he was early thrown into\r\nrelations with some of the leading naturalists of his time, chiefly\r\nit appears by his own initiative, and doubtless he owed much in those\r\nopening years to the advice and stimulus of such men as Dawson Turner,\r\nand Sir James Smith. Elected to the Linnean Society in 1806, he became\r\nacquainted in the same year with Sir Joseph Banks, Robert Brown, and\r\nother leading naturalists. Thus when other young men would be feeling\r\nfor their first footing, he at the age of 21 had already penetrated\r\ninto the innermost circle of the Science of the country. For a period\r\nof sixty years he held there a place unique in its activity. He shared\r\nwith Augustin Pyrame De Candolle and with Robert Brown the position of\r\ngreatest prominence among systematists, during the time which Sachs\r\nhas described as that of \"the Development of the Natural System under\r\nthe Dogma of Constancy of Species.\" The interval between the death of\r\nLinnaeus and the publication of the _Origin of Species_ can show no\r\ngreater triumvirate of botanists than these, working each in his own\r\nway, but simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe active life of Sir William Hooker divides itself naturally into\r\ntwo main periods, during which he held two of the most responsible\r\nofficial posts in the country, viz. the Regius Chair of Botany in\r\nGlasgow and the Directorship of the Royal Gardens at Kew. We may pass\r\nover with but brief notice the years from 1806 to 1820, which preceded\r\nhis attainment of professorial rank. Notwithstanding that notable work\r\nwas done by him in those years, the period was essentially preparatory\r\nand provisional, and can hardly be reckoned as an integral part of\r\nhis official life. He was in point of fact an enthusiastic amateur,\r\none of that class which has always been a brilliant ornament of the\r\nBotany of this country, and has contributed to its best work. He\r\ntravelled, making successive tours in Scotland and the Isles, no slight\r\nundertaking in those days (1807, 1808). In 1809 he made his celebrated\r\nvoyage to Iceland, described in his _Journal_, published in 1811.\r\nBut his collections from Iceland were entirely lost by fire on the\r\nreturn voyage. His son remarks that the loss to science was probably\r\ngreatest in respect of the Cryptogamic collections; this naturally\r\nfollowed from the fact that already he had taken a prominent place as\r\na student of the lower forms, and the field for their study was more\r\nopen than among the flowering plants of the island. It was among the\r\nCryptogams that Sir William found the theme of his first great work,\r\nthe _British Jungermanniae_, published in 1816. Nearly a century after\r\nits appearance it still stands notable not only for the beauty of the\r\nanalytical plates, but as a foundation for reference. It must still be\r\nconsulted by all who work critically upon the group, subdivided today,\r\nbut comprehended then in the single genus _Jungermannia_. During this\r\nperiod he also produced the _Musci Exotici_, with figures of 176 new\r\nspecies from various quarters of the globe. Thus up to 1820 his chief\r\nsuccesses lay in the sphere of Cryptogamic Botany.\r\n\r\nNaturally so ardent a botanist desired to widen his experience by\r\ntravel. But circumstances checked the projects which he successively\r\nformed to visit Ceylon and Java, South Africa, and Brazil. In 1814 he\r\nwent to France, and became acquainted with the leading botanists of\r\nParis. He proceeded to Switzerland and Lombardy, returning in 1815,\r\nin which year he married the eldest daughter of his friend Mr Dawson\r\nTurner. Meanwhile, at his father-in-law's suggestion he had embarked\r\nin a business for which he was not specially fitted by experience or\r\nby inclination. It did not prove a success, and as the years drew on,\r\nhaving a young family dependent upon him, he began to look out for\r\nsome botanical appointment which should at once satisfy his personal\r\ntastes, and be remunerative. The chair in Glasgow becoming vacant\r\nin 1820 by the transfer of Dr Graham to Edinburgh, he received the\r\nappointment from the Crown, largely through the influence of Sir Joseph\r\nBanks. He entered upon its duties never having lectured before to a\r\nclass of students, nor even heard such lectures, but otherwise equipped\r\nfor their performance in a way that would bear comparison with any of\r\nthe professors of his time.\r\n\r\nGlasgow was in 1820 at an interesting juncture in its botanical\r\nhistory. Though the science of botany had been taught for a whole\r\ncentury in the University, a separate chair had been founded by the\r\nCrown only two years before. Moreover, though there had been for a\r\nlong period a \"Physic Garden\" in the grounds of the old College, this\r\nhad proved insufficient, and its position within the growing town\r\nunsuitable. Accordingly, in part by grant from the Crown, partly from\r\nthe funds of the University, but largely by the subscriptions of\r\nenthusiastic citizens a Botanic Garden had been founded under Royal\r\nCharter in 1817, and opened to the public in 1819. The first blush of\r\nnovelty had not worn off this new enterprise when a man, already in a\r\nleading position, whose successful achievements had shown his quality,\r\nacquainted with many of the leading botanists of Europe, and with\r\nyouth and unbounded energy at his disposal entered upon the scene, and\r\nbegan that course of organisation of Public Botanic Gardens which he\r\ncontinued to the day of his death.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to prevent the Glasgow establishment from rapidly\r\ntaking a leading position. Largely as the result of Hooker's influence\r\nand initiative, and assisted greatly no doubt by the zeal with which\r\nthe movement was supported by individual citizens, and aided by the\r\nposition of Glasgow as a great commercial centre, contributions to\r\nthe garden began to come in from every quarter of the globe. Taking\r\nthe number of species represented as a measure, the growth of the\r\nliving collections was rapid beyond precedent. In 1821 the number of\r\nspecies living in the garden was about 9000: in 1825 it is quoted at\r\n12,000, while the increase in number from that period onwards was\r\nabout 300 to 500 per annum. Of these a large number were new species,\r\nnot previously described or figured. This work Hooker carried out, and\r\nthe publication of his results widened still further the desire of the\r\nofficials of other gardens to effect exchanges. In 1828, after it had\r\nbeen in existence but ten years, the Glasgow garden was corresponding\r\nas an equal with 12 British and Irish, 21 European, and 5 Tropical\r\ngardens, while it had established relations with upwards of 300 private\r\ngardens. In 1825 Sir William Hooker published a list of the living\r\nplants in pamphlet form, with a plan of the garden, copies of which are\r\nstill extant. But the following years, from 1825 to 1840 were the most\r\nnotable in its history as a scientific institution. It is recorded in\r\nthe minute books that scientific visitors almost invariably expressed\r\nthe opinion that the garden would not suffer by comparison with any\r\nother similar establishment in Europe. It can hardly have come as a\r\nsurprise to those who had witnessed his work in Glasgow that when a\r\nDirector had to be appointed to the Royal Gardens at Kew, the post was\r\noffered to Hooker. He accepted the appointment and left Glasgow in 1841.\r\n\r\nHis conduct of the Glasgow professorship from 1820 to 1841 was a\r\nsuccess from the first, notwithstanding his entire want of prior\r\nexperience of such duties. Sir Joseph Hooker, in his speech at the\r\nopening of the New Botanical Buildings in Glasgow University, in 1901\r\npointed out how he \"had resources that enabled him to overcome all\r\nobstacles: familiarity with his subject, devotion to its study, energy,\r\neloquence, a commanding presence, with urbanity of manners, and above\r\nall the art of making the student love the science he taught.\" Not\r\nonly students in medicine, for whom the course was primarily designed,\r\nattended the lectures, but private citizens, and even officers from the\r\nbarracks.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph describes his father's course as opening with a few\r\nintroductory lectures on the history of botany, and the general\r\ncharacter of plant-life. As a rule the first half of each hour\r\nwas occupied with lecturing on organography, morphology, and\r\nclassification, and the second half with the analysis in the class-room\r\nof specimens supplied to the pupils, the most studious of whom took\r\nthese home for further examination. An interesting event in these\r\nhalf-hours was the professor calling upon such students as volunteered\r\nfor being examined, to demonstrate the structure of a plant or fruit\r\nplaced in the hands of the whole class for this purpose. The lectures\r\nwere illustrated by blackboard drawings, probably these were a special\r\nfeature in the hands of so experienced an artist as he, and also by\r\nlarge coloured drawings, chiefly of medicinal plants, which were hung\r\non the walls. Another feature, which happily still survives, was the\r\ncollection of lithographed illustrations of the organs of plants, a\r\ncopy of which was placed before every two students. The first edition\r\nof these drawings appears to have been by his own hand. But in 1837 a\r\nthin quarto volume of _Botanical Illustrations_ was produced, \"being\r\na series of above a thousand figures, selected from the best sources,\r\ndesigned to explain the terms employed in a course of Lectures on\r\nBotany.\" The plates were executed by Walter Fitch, who was originally\r\na pattern-drawer in a calico-printing establishment, and entered the\r\nservice of Sir William in 1834. This great botanical artist continued\r\nto assist Sir William till the death of the latter, and himself died at\r\nKew in 1892. A number of copies of this early work of Fitch remain to\r\nthe present day in the Botanical Department in Glasgow.\r\n\r\nOther branches, however, besides Descriptive Organography were taken\r\nup. Naturally the plants of medicinal value figured largely in the\r\ncourse, which was primarily for medical students. Illustrative\r\nspecimens, of which Sir William gathered a large collection, were\r\nhanded round for inspection. These, together with other objects of\r\neconomic interest finally made their way to Kew, and were embodied in\r\nthe great collections of the Kew Museums. The branch of anatomy of the\r\nplant-tissues was not neglected. Of this he wrote at the time of taking\r\nup the duties of the chair, \"it is a subject to which I have never\r\nattended, and authors are so much at variance as to their opinions,\r\nand on the facts too, that I really do not know whom to follow.\" He\r\ncontinues with a remark which is singularly like what one might have\r\nheard in the early seventies, just before the revival of the laboratory\r\nstudy of plants in this country. He remarked that \"Mirbel has seen\r\nwhat nobody else can: so nobody contradicts him, though many won't\r\nbelieve him.\" I can hardly doubt that physiology of plants will also\r\nhave figured in the course, first because Sir William was himself a\r\nsuccessful gardener, but secondly because we have in the Botanical\r\nDepartment in Glasgow the syllabus of the lectures of Professor\r\nHamilton who taught botany in the University in the latter end of the\r\n18th century. In this course physiology took a surprisingly large\r\nplace, and we can hardly believe that it would have dropped out of Sir\r\nWilliam's course altogether. But of this there is no definite record.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the teaching of Sir William was the practical\r\nillustration of botany in the field, by means of excursions. Of these\r\nSir Joseph tells us there were habitually three in each summer session,\r\ntwo of them on Saturdays, to favourable points in the neighbourhood\r\nof Glasgow; but the third, which took place about the end of June,\r\nwas a larger undertaking. With a party of some thirty students, and\r\noccasional scientific visitors from elsewhere, he started for the\r\nWestern Highlands, usually the Breadalbane range. In those days,\r\nbefore railways, and often with indifferent roads, this was no light\r\naffair, and in some cases it involved camping. I do not know whether\r\nthis was the beginning of those class excursions which have been so\r\nmarked a feature in the botanical work of the Scottish Universities,\r\nbut it is to be remembered that his immediate successor in the Glasgow\r\nchair was Dr Hutton Balfour, who in later years confirmed and extended\r\nthe practice, and it has been kept up continuously in the Scottish\r\nuniversities ever since. It was to meet the requirements of such\r\nwork in the field that Sir William prepared and published the _Flora\r\nScotica_. The first edition appeared before his second year's class\r\nhad assembled in 1821. The first Part related to the Phanerogams only,\r\narranged according to the Linnaean system. The second, which seems to\r\nhave been almost as much a new book as a second edition, contained the\r\nPhanerogams arranged according to the natural system, just then coming\r\ninto general use. It also embodied the Cryptogams, in the working up\r\nof which he had the assistance of Lindley and of Greville. The total\r\nnumber of species described was 1784, of which 902 were Cryptogams.\r\n\r\nAnd thus was initiated that profuse and rapid course of publication\r\nwhich characterised the period of office of Sir William Hooker in\r\nGlasgow. The duties of the chair were comparatively light, and only in\r\nhis later years did he extend them voluntarily into the winter months.\r\nHe worked year in year out, early and late, at his writing, and rarely\r\nleft home. The 21 years of his professorship were perhaps the most\r\nprolific period of his literary production. It was brought to a close\r\nin 1841, by his appointment to the directorship of the Royal Gardens at\r\nKew, which had in March 1840 been transferred from the Crown, under the\r\nLord Steward's Department, to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests.\r\nSir William had been for some time desirous of changing the scene of\r\nhis activities from the relatively remote city of Glasgow to some more\r\ncentral point, and the opening at Kew not only satisfied this wish,\r\nbut also put him in command of the establishment in which he saw, even\r\nin its then undeveloped state, the possibility of expansion into a\r\nbotanical centre worthy of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1841 Sir William removed to Kew, taking with him\r\nhis library, his private museum and herbarium. This was the first of\r\nthose incidents of denudation of the botanical department in Glasgow,\r\nthe direct result of the system that held its place in the Scottish\r\nUniversities till the Act of 1889. Till that date the chair was\r\n\"farmed\" by the professor. Almost all the illustrative collections\r\nand books of reference were his private property. Whenever, as has\r\nrepeatedly been the case in Glasgow, the occupant of the chair was\r\npromoted elsewhere, he naturally took his property with him, and the\r\nUniversity was denuded, almost to blank walls. Fortunately that is so\r\nno longer. But in the present case the collections were removed, and\r\nfinally formed the basis of the great museums, and of the herbarium of\r\nKew.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Sir William's appointment Kew itself was in a very\r\nunsatisfactory state. The acreage of the garden was small compared with\r\nwhat it now is. The houses were old, and of patterns which have long\r\nbecome obsolete. Only two of them are now standing, viz. the Aroid\r\nhouse near the great gates, and the old Orangery, now used as a museum\r\nfor timbers. There was no library, and no herbarium. In fact Kew in\r\n1841 was simply an appanage to a palace, where a more than usually\r\nextensive collection of living plants were grown. In the course of the\r\nnegotiations which led up to the transfer to the Department of Woods\r\nand Forests it had even been suggested that the collections themselves\r\nshould be parted with. It was to such an establishment, with everything\r\nto make, and little indeed to make it from, that Sir William Hooker\r\ncame at the age of 55. He had, however, unbounded enthusiasm, and\r\nconfidence in the public spirit, and in himself: and what was still\r\nmore to the point, the experience gained in the smaller field of\r\nGlasgow, in building up the garden there, combined with a knowledge of\r\nplants which was almost unrivalled, and acquaintance with the leading\r\nbotanists and horticulturalists of Europe. It was then no matter for\r\nsurprise that he should accept the position, even though the initial\r\nsalary was small, and no official house was provided.\r\n\r\nAs the date of Sir William's appointment may be said to be the\r\nbirth-day of the new development of Kew, it will be well to pause a\r\nmoment and consider the position of botanical affairs in Europe at that\r\ntime. The glamour of the Linnaean period had faded, and the Natural\r\nSystem of Classification of Plants initiated by De Jussieu had fully\r\nestablished its position, and had been worked into detail, taking\r\nits most elaborate form in the _Prodromus Systematis Naturalis_ of\r\nAugustin Pyrame De Candolle. That great luminary of Geneva died in\r\nthis very year of 1841, leaving his work, initiated but far indeed\r\nfrom completion, in the hands of his son Alphonse. In England, Robert\r\nBrown was in the full plenitude of his powers, and in possession of\r\nthe Banksian herbarium was evolving out of its rich materials new\r\nprinciples of classification, and fresh morphological comparisons.\r\nIn fact morphology was at this time being differentiated from mere\r\nsystematic as a separate discipline. Nothing contributed more\r\neffectively to this than the publication of _Die Botanik als inductive\r\nWissenschaft_, by Schleiden, the first edition of which appeared in\r\n1842: for in it development and embryology were for the first time\r\nindicated as the foundation of all insight into morphology. But\r\nnotwithstanding the great advances of this period in tracing natural\r\naffinities, and in the pursuit of morphological comparison, branches\r\nwhich would seem to provide the true basis for some theory of Descent,\r\nthe Dogma of Constancy of Species still reigned. It was to continue\r\nyet for 20 years, and the most active part of the life of the first\r\nDirector of Kew was spent under its influence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile great advances had been made also in the knowledge of the\r\nmature framework of cell-membrane in plants. Anatomy initiated in Great\r\nBritain in the publications of Hooke, Grew, and Malpighi, had developed\r\nin the hands of many \"phytotomists,\" the series culminating in the\r\nwork of Von Mohl. But it was chiefly the mere skeleton which was the\r\nsubject of their interest. Eight years previously, it is true (1833),\r\nRobert Brown had described and figured the nucleus of the cell, and\r\napproached even the focal point of its interest, viz. in its relation\r\nto reproduction. But the demonstration of the cytoplasm in which it was\r\nembedded was yet to come. In fact, the knowledge of structure omitted\r\nas yet any details of that body which we now hold to be the \"physical\r\nbasis of life.\"\r\n\r\nThe period immediately succeeding 1841, was, however, a time pregnant\r\nwith new developments. The study of protoplasm soon engaged the\r\nattention of Von Mohl. Apical growth was investigated by Naegeli and\r\nLeitgeb. The discovery of the sexuality of ferns, and the completion\r\nof the life-story by Bischoff, Naegeli, and Suminski led up to the\r\ngreat generalisation of Hofmeister. And thus the years following 1841\r\nwitnessed the initiation of morphology in its modern development.\r\nOn the other hand, Lyell's _Principles of Geology_ had appeared and\r\nobtained wide acceptance. Darwin himself was freshly back from the\r\nVoyage of the \"Beagle,\" while Sir Joseph Hooker, then a young medical\r\nman, was at that very time away with Ross on his Antarctic voyage, and\r\nshortly afterwards started on his great journey to the Himalaya. These\r\nthree great figures, the fore-runner of Evolution, the author of the\r\n_Origin of Species_, and Darwin's first adherent among biologists, were\r\nthus in their various ways working towards that generalisation which\r\nwas so soon to revolutionise the science of which Kew was to become\r\nthe official British centre. Well may we then regard this date, and\r\nthe event which it carried with it, as a nodal point in the history of\r\nbotany not only in this country, but also in the world at large.\r\n\r\nThe urgent necessity for such an official centre as Kew now is was\r\npatent in the interests of the British Empire. The need of it had\r\nalready been clearly before the minds of the Parliamentary Commission,\r\nappointed a few years before, with Dr Lindley as chairman, to report\r\nupon the question of the retaining of the Botanic Gardens at Kew. The\r\nreport contained the following passage which, while it formulates an\r\nideal then to be aimed at, summarises in great measure the activities\r\nof the present establishment at Kew. \"The wealthiest and most\r\ncivilised country in Europe offers the only European example of the\r\nwant of one of the first proofs of wealth and civilisation. There are\r\nmany gardens in the British colonies and dependencies, as Calcutta,\r\nBombay, Saharunpore, the Mauritius, Sydney, and Trinidad, costing many\r\nthousands a year: their utility is much diminished by the want of some\r\nsystem under which they can be regulated and controlled. There is no\r\nunity of purpose among them; their objects are unsettled, and their\r\npowers wasted from not receiving a proper direction: they afford no\r\naid to each other, and it is to be feared, but little to the countries\r\nwhere they are established: and yet they are capable of conferring\r\nvery important benefits on commerce, and of conducing essentially to\r\ncolonial prosperity. A National Botanic Garden would be the centre\r\naround which all these lesser establishments should be arranged:\r\nthey should all be placed under the control of the chief of that\r\ngarden, acting with him, and through him with each other, recording\r\nconstantly their proceedings, explaining their wants, receiving\r\nsupplies, and aiding the mother country in everything useful in the\r\nvegetable kingdom: medicine, commerce, agriculture, horticulture, and\r\nmany branches of manufacture would derive considerable advantage from\r\nthe establishment of such a system.... From a garden of this kind\r\nGovernment could always obtain authentic and official information upon\r\npoints connected with the establishment of new Colonies: it would\r\nafford the plants required on these occasions, without its being\r\nnecessary, as now, to apply to the officers of private establishments\r\nfor advice and help.... Such a garden would be the great source of\r\nnew and valuable plants to be introduced and dispersed through this\r\ncountry, and a powerful means of increasing the pleasures of those who\r\nalready possess gardens: while, what is far more important, it would\r\nundoubtedly become an efficient instrument in refining the taste,\r\nincreasing the knowledge, and augmenting the rational pleasures of that\r\nimportant class of society, to provide for whose instruction is so\r\ngreat and wise an object of the present administration.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the surrounding conditions, and such the aims of Sir William\r\nHooker when he took up the duties of Director of the Royal Gardens. He\r\nwas, however, given no specific instructions on entering office. He\r\ntherefore determined to follow the suggestions of Dr Lindley's Report,\r\nand in the carrying of them out he had powerful support, both official\r\nand other. The original area of the Garden, apart from the Pleasure\r\nGrounds and the Deer Park, was small; when first taken over from the\r\nLord Steward's Department by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests,\r\nit extended only to about 18 acres, and the Chief Commissioner, Lord\r\nDuncannon, was strongly opposed to their enlargement, or to further\r\nexpenditure upon them. It required methods of diplomacy, as well as\r\ndetermination and energy, not always to be found among scientific\r\nmen, to carry into effect the scheme laid down in the Report, and\r\nsuccess came only slowly. In 1842 additional ground was taken in from\r\nthe Pleasure Grounds, so as to afford an entrance from Kew Green, now\r\nthe principal gate of the Garden. In 1843 there were added 48 acres\r\nof Arboretum, including the site of the Great Palm House. This was\r\ncommenced in 1844 and was followed in 1846 by the Orchid House. In\r\n1848 the old storehouse for fruit (close to the fruit garden of the\r\nold Palace, now the site of the Herbaceous Ground), was converted into\r\na Museum of Economic Botany, the first of its kind to be established.\r\nIt was in part furnished by the collections which Sir William had\r\nbrought with him from Glasgow. It now stands as Museum No. II. In\r\n1850 the Water-Lily House was built, and in 1855 the long house for\r\nSucculents. Meanwhile, in 1853, an official house had been found for\r\nthe Director, while another Crown house adjoining Kew Green was\r\nhanded over for the growing herbarium and library. These, which were\r\nin the main if not indeed altogether the private property of the\r\nDirector, had up to this time been housed in his private residence.\r\nNow they found more convenient accommodation, where they would be more\r\naccessible for reference, in a building belonging to the establishment.\r\nIn 1857 the Museum No. I. was opened. For long the collections had\r\nexceeded the space in the older Economic Museum (No. II.). This was,\r\nhowever, retained for the specimens belonging to the Monocotyledons\r\nand Cryptogams, while those of the Dicotyledons were arranged in\r\nthe new and spacious building of No. I. In 1861 a reading-room and\r\nlecture-room for gardeners was opened, and in 1862 the central portion\r\nof the great range of the Temperate House was completed from plans\r\napproved in 1859. The wings which now complete the original design were\r\nadded many years afterwards. In 1863 the old Orangery was disused as\r\na plant-house, and diverted to the purpose of a Museum for Timbers,\r\nchiefly of colonial origin. It is now known as Museum No. III. The\r\nabove may serve as a summary of the more important material additions\r\nto the Kew establishment, made during the life of Sir William Hooker.\r\nIt will be clear that his activity must have been unceasing, in working\r\ntowards the ideal sketched in the report of Dr Lindley. His efforts\r\nnever abated till his death in 1865, in the 81st year of his age. The\r\nestablishment of Kew has developed further as years went on. But as he\r\nleft it, the essentials were already present which should constitute\r\na great Imperial Garden. Truly Sir William Hooker may be said to have\r\nbeen the maker of Kew, if regard be taken merely of the material\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nIn no less degree may he be held to have been the maker of Kew\r\nin respect of its scientific collections, its methods, and its\r\nachievements. To these his own untiring activity contributed the\r\ndriving force, while his wide knowledge, and ready apprehension of fact\r\ngave the broad foundation necessary for successful action. But as the\r\nperiod of development of Kew in these respects was but the culmination\r\nof the work already initiated in Glasgow, it will be well to review\r\nSir William Hooker's scientific achievements over the whole of his\r\nprofessional career, including the Glasgow period together with his\r\nlater years at Kew.\r\n\r\nTaking first the living collections, he had already shown at Glasgow,\r\nwhere the opportunities were more limited than at Kew, a singular\r\nsuccess in securing additions to the plants under cultivation. This\r\nis now reflected more clearly in the lists which were published from\r\ntime to time than in any actual specimens still living after the\r\nvicissitudes of cultivation of 70 years; though it is not improbable\r\nthat some of our older specimens date from his period of office. The\r\ncurrent floristic serials, many of them produced and even personally\r\nillustrated by himself, also form a record of the novelties from time\r\nto time secured. This rapid growth of the Glasgow garden has already\r\nbeen noted, and the large number of the plants introduced under his\r\ninfluence. It only required the same methods to be put in practice in\r\nthe larger sphere of action of the metropolis to ensure a similar,\r\nthough a far greater result at Kew. Moreover, the official position\r\nwhich he there held as Director, gave an increasing obligation to meet\r\nhis wishes on the part of foreign and colonial gardens, and other\r\nsources of supply. Notable among the many other living collections that\r\nresulted was the series of Ferns, already a subject of his detailed\r\nstudy while at Glasgow. In its maintenance and increase he was ably\r\nassisted by the Curator, Mr John Smith, himself no small a contributor\r\nto the systematic treatment of the Ferns. Hooker's aim was, however,\r\nnot to forward the interests of any special group of plants, but to\r\nmake the collections as representative as possible. This is clearly\r\nreflected in the various character of the plant-houses successively\r\nbuilt at his instigation, and remaining still to testify to the\r\ncatholicity of his views.\r\n\r\nIn the days at Glasgow, Sir William had already made his private museum\r\nancillary to the living collections, in his endeavour to demonstrate\r\nthe characters of the vegetable world. This line of demonstration he\r\nfurther developed after his removal to Kew, and the results, together\r\nwith later additions, but with methods little changed, are to be\r\nseen in the splendid museums of the Gardens at the present time. The\r\nspecimens were from the first mainly illustrative of Economic Botany,\r\nsuch as are of service to the merchant, the manufacturer, the dyer,\r\nthe chemist and druggist, and the physician: or to artificers in wood\r\nand in textiles. But the interests of the scientific botanist were not\r\nforgotten, while a special feature from the first was the portrait\r\ngallery of the leaders in the subject. Thus the museums which he\r\ninitiated, and were indeed the first Museums of Economic Botany ever\r\nformed, are now not the least interesting and certainly among the most\r\ninstructive features of Kew.\r\n\r\nBut the centre of the Garden for reference and for detailed study is\r\nnow the herbarium and library, housed in the large building near to\r\nthe entrance from Kew Green. To those familiar with that magnificent\r\nmine of accumulated learning as it now stands, it may be a surprise to\r\nhear that it has grown in the course of less than 60 years out of the\r\nprivate collections of Sir William Hooker, and of his friend Bentham.\r\nThe story of it may be gathered from the sketch of the Life and Labours\r\nof the First Director, published by Sir Joseph Hooker in the _Annals\r\nof Botany_ in 1903, a work to which I have been largely indebted for\r\nthe materials for this lecture. The Hookerian herbarium and library\r\nwere already extensive before it was removed from Glasgow. When the new\r\nDirector of Kew took up his appointment, neither books nor a herbarium\r\nwere provided for him: but he was well equipped with those of his\r\nown. They were at first lodged in his private house, till in 1853 he\r\nmoved into the official residence. But the latter did not afford the\r\naccommodation for them which the Government had guaranteed. They were\r\ntherefore placed in a building adjacent to the Botanic Garden. It was\r\nfurther agreed, on condition that the herbarium and library should be\r\naccessible to botanists, that he should be provided with a scientific\r\nherbarium Curator. Four years afterwards the Royal Gardens came into\r\npossession, by gift, of the very extensive library and herbarium of\r\nG. Bentham, Esq., which was second only to Hooker's own in extent,\r\nmethodical arrangement, and nomenclature; and it was placed in the\r\nsame building. The two collections in considerable degree overlapped,\r\nbeing derived from the same sources. But one great difference between\r\nthem was that Bentham confined his herbarium to flowering plants, while\r\nHooker's rapidly grew to be the richest in the world in both flowering\r\nand flowerless plants. Finally after his death it was acquired by\r\npurchase for the State in 1866, together with about 1000 volumes from\r\nhis library, and a unique collection of botanical drawings, maps, MSS.,\r\nportraits of botanists, and letters from botanical correspondents,\r\nwhich amounted to about 27,000. These were the prime foundations of\r\nthe great herbarium and library now at Kew. Great additions have since\r\nbeen made by purchase and by gift, and the building has been repeatedly\r\nextended to receive the growing mass of material. But for all time the\r\ncharacter and individuality of the collections will remain stamped by\r\nthe personality of those two great benefactors, Bentham and the first\r\nHooker.\r\n\r\nSufficient has now been said to indicate that Hooker's work was that\r\nof a pioneer, in providing the material foundation necessary for the\r\nfurther study of the science, not only in this country, but also in\r\nthe furthest lands of the Empire. He supplied a coordinating centre\r\nfor botanical organisation in Britain, and for that service he has\r\nearned the lasting gratitude of botanists. It remains to review his\r\nown published works, and base upon them some estimate of his more\r\ndirect influence upon the progress of the science. We shall see that\r\nin this also his work was largely of that nature which affords a basis\r\nfor future development. It was carried out almost entirely under\r\npre-Darwinian conditions. He was pre-eminently a descriptive botanist,\r\nwho worked under the influence of the current belief in the constancy\r\nof species. But his enormous output of accurate description and of\r\ndelineation of the most varied forms, has provided a sure basis upon\r\nwhich the more modern seeker after phyletic lines may proceed.\r\n\r\nThere have been few if any writers on botanical subjects so prolific\r\nas Sir William Hooker, and probably none have ever equalled him in the\r\nnumber and accuracy of the plates which illustrated his writings. Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker estimates the number of the latter at nearly 8000, of\r\nwhich about 1800 were from drawings executed by himself. The remainder\r\nwere chiefly from the hand of Walter Fitch, who acted as botanical\r\nlimner to Sir William for thirty years, showing in the work fidelity,\r\nartistic skill and extraordinary rapidity of execution. The numbers\r\nquoted give some idea of the magnitude of the results.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of a rapid review of the chief writings of Sir\r\nWilliam's later years, they may be classified under three heads, viz.\r\n(1) Journals, (2) Floristic works, and (3) Writings on the Filicales.\r\nTaking first the Journals, one of the most remarkable features about\r\nthem is the apparent variety and number of the enterprises on which\r\nSir William engaged: this is, however, explained when they are\r\npieced together as they will be found below. His connection during\r\n45 years with large and growing gardens, into which the most varied\r\nliving specimens were being drafted in a constant stream, put him\r\nin possession of a vast mass of facts, detached, but needing to be\r\nrecorded. The materials were thus present for that type of publication\r\nstyled a _Botanical Miscellany_. The majority of the serials which\r\nhe edited took this form, and though published under various titles,\r\ndictated in some measure by the source of their publication, more than\r\none of them was a mere continuation of a predecessor under a different\r\ntitle. The first of them appeared under the name of the _Exotic Flora_,\r\nin three volumes (1823-7), with 232 coloured plates illustrating\r\nsubjects from the Gardens of Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Liverpool. But\r\nowing to his taking up in 1827 the editorship of the _Botanical\r\nMagazine_, then in a critical position, the _Exotic Flora_ ceased, and\r\nits materials swelled the pages of the more ancient serial, with which\r\nhe was connected till his death.\r\n\r\nTo those not intimately acquainted with the other serials edited by Sir\r\nWilliam, their relations are difficult to trace. But Sir Joseph Hooker\r\nhas given their titles in series, with their dates, as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Botanical Miscellany._ 3 vols. 1830-33.\r\n  _Journal of Botany._ 1 vol. 1834.\r\n  _Companion of the Botanical Magazine._ 2 vols. 1835-36.\r\n  _Jardine's Annals of Natural History._ 4 vols. 1838-40.\r\n  _The Journal of Botany (continued)._ Vols. II.-IV. 1840-42.\r\n  _The London Journal of Botany._ 7 vols. 1842-48.\r\n  _The Companion of the Botanical Magazine._ (New Series. 1845-48.)\r\n  _London Journal of Botany and Kew Gardens Miscellany._ 9 vols. 1849-57.\r\n\r\nFrom this list it appears that throughout a long term of years, though\r\nunder varying titles, the stream of information gathered chiefly\r\nthrough garden management was edited and published, taking the form of\r\n28 volumes, with 556 plates.\r\n\r\nThe \"Floristic\" works of Sir William Hooker began with the second\r\nedition of Curtis's _Flora Londinensis_, in five folio volumes, upon\r\nwhich he worked from 1817 to 1828. He contributed a large proportion\r\nof the plates from his own drawings, while the descriptions throughout\r\n(excepting those of the plates on Algae and Fungi by R. K. Greville)\r\nwere enlarged, and rewritten by him. He was in fact the real author of\r\nthe work, which, however, was so badly edited--even the letter-press\r\nwas not paged--that citation of it was impossible, and it never took\r\nits proper place as a scientific work. Sir Joseph Hooker points out\r\nthat the second edition was not properly styled _Flora Londinensis_,\r\nsince it included many species which are not indigenous anywhere near\r\nLondon. But these were the lapses of the editor, not of the author\r\nand artist. Minor works were the accounts of the plants collected on\r\nParry's and Sabine's Arctic voyages (1823-28), but the _Flora Boreali\r\nAmericana_ was a more important undertaking. It appeared as two quarto\r\nvolumes (1829-40), in which 2500 species were described with numerous\r\nillustrations. It was based on the collections of various travellers,\r\nand included ferns and their allies. In 1830 came the first edition of\r\nthe _British Flora_, a work which was continued through eight editions,\r\nthe last being in 1860, and it contained 1636 species. The botanical\r\nresults of Beechey's voyage in the \"Blossom\" to the Behring Sea, the\r\nPacific Ocean, and China were produced jointly with Dr Walker-Arnott\r\nin 1830-41, as a quarto volume, with descriptions of about 2700\r\nspecies, and notable for the diversity of the floras included. In 1849\r\nthe _Niger Flora_ appeared, dealing with the collections of Vogel on\r\nthe Niger expedition of 1841. But the most remarkable of all these\r\nfloristic works was the great series of the _Icones Plantarum_. It was\r\ninitiated in 1837 for the illustration of _New and rare plants selected\r\nfrom the Author's Herbarium_, and was continued by him till his death\r\nin 1865. Owing to the munificence of Bentham's bequest to the Kew\r\nHerbarium for its continuance and illustration, it remains still as the\r\nprincipal channel for the description and delineation of new and rare\r\nplants from the Kew Herbarium. The fact that the number of the plates\r\nis now about 3000 gives some idea of the magnitude of this work, which\r\nwas started by Sir William Hooker in the later days of his Glasgow\r\nprofessorship.\r\n\r\nIt might well be thought that the production of the works already\r\nnamed would have sufficed to occupy a life-time, especially when it is\r\nremembered that they were produced in the intervals of leisure after\r\nthe performance of the official duties of a professor, and later of the\r\nDirector of the growing establishment at Kew. But there still remain to\r\nbe mentioned that noble series of publications on the Filicales, which\r\ngave Sir William Hooker the position of the leading Pteridologist of\r\nhis time. The series on ferns began with the _Icones Filicum_ (1828-31)\r\nin two folio volumes, with 240 coloured plates by R. K. Greville, the\r\ntext being written by Hooker. The same authors again cooperated in the\r\n_Enumeratio Filicum_ (1832), a work projected to give the synonymy,\r\ncitation of authors, habitat, and description of new and imperfectly\r\nknown species. But it only extended to the first 13 genera, including\r\nthe Lycopodineae, Ophioglosseae, Marattiaceae, and Osmundaceae, and was\r\nthen dropped. Here may be conveniently introduced a number of volumes,\r\nwhich were for the illustration of ferns, but not systematically\r\narranged. They were issued from time to time, and collectively give a\r\nlarge but not a coordinated body of fact. They were, the _First Century\r\nof Ferns_, issued in 1854; the _Filices Exoticae_ in 1859; a _Second\r\nCentury of Ferns_ in 1861; _British Ferns_ also in 1861, and _Garden\r\nFerns_ in 1862.\r\n\r\nThere still remain to be mentioned three great systematic works on\r\nferns, each of which is complete in itself, viz. the _Genera Filicum_,\r\nthe _Species Filicum_, and the _Synopsis Filicum_. The first of these\r\nwas the _Genera Filicum_ (1838-40), a volume issued in parts, royal\r\noctavo, with 126 coloured plates illustrating 135 genera. It goes\r\nunder the joint names of Francis Bauer and Sir William Hooker, the\r\nlatter being described on the title-page as Director of Kew. But the\r\npreface is dated May 1, 1838, from Glasgow, and it was printed at\r\nthe University Press. The title-page further states that the plates\r\nwere from the drawings of F. Bauer, but Sir Joseph Hooker points out\r\n(_l.c._ p. cviii), that \"of the whole 135 genera depicted I think\r\nthat 78 are by Fitch.\" Sir William in the preface states that \"The\r\nplates have all been executed in my own residence, and under my own\r\neye, in zincography, by a young artist, Walter Fitch, with a delicacy\r\nand accuracy which I trust will not discredit the figures from which\r\nthey were copied.\" The result is one of the most sumptuous volumes in\r\nillustration of a single family ever published. After 70 years it is\r\nstill the natural companion of all Pteridologists. At its close is a\r\nsynopsis of the genera of ferns, according to Presl's arrangement,\r\nwhich Sir William describes as \"the most full and complete that has yet\r\nbeen published.\" But in the preface he remarks that Presl \"has laid too\r\nmuch stress on the number and other circumstances connected with the\r\nbundles of vessels in the stipes, which in the Herbarium are difficult\r\nof investigation.\" This is a specially illuminating passage for us at\r\na time when anatomical characters are becoming ever more important as\r\nphyletic indices. It shows that readiness of diagnosis was for him a\r\nmore important factor than details of structural similarity.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to the _Genera Filicum_ Sir William says, he \"would\r\nnot have it to be understood that the Genera here introduced are\r\nwhat I definitely recommend as, in every instance, worthy of being\r\nretained.... A more accurate examination of the several species of each\r\nGenus, which are now under review in the preparation of a _Species\r\nFilicum_, will enable me hereafter to form a more correct judgement on\r\nthis head than it is now in my power to do.\" The five volumes of the\r\n_Species Filicum_ thus promised, appeared at intervals from 1846 to\r\n1864. The work is briefly characterised by Sir Joseph as consisting\r\nof \"descriptions of the known Ferns, particularly of such as exist in\r\nthe Author's Herbarium, or are with sufficient accuracy described in\r\nthe works to which he has had access, accompanied by numerous Figures.\r\nThis which will probably prove to be the most enduring monument to\r\nmy father's labour as a systematist and descriptive pteridologist, is\r\ncomprised in five 8vo volumes, embracing nearly 2500 species, with 304\r\nplates by Fitch, illustrating 520 of these. It occupied much of the\r\nlatter eighteen years of his life, the last part appearing in 1864.\"\r\nThe work is a most extraordinary mine of detailed information. It is\r\na condensed extract from his own unrivalled _Herbarium of Ferns_,\r\nwith exact data of distribution, and collectors' numbers. Probably no\r\nfamily so extensive as this has ever been monographed by a single hand\r\nwith such minuteness and exhaustive care. It is the classic book of\r\nreference in the systematic study of ferns. But as indicated in the\r\npreface to the Genera, the judgement as to which genera are \"worthy of\r\nbeing retained\" had been exercised. The result was the merging of a\r\nnumber of the genera of Presl, and others, into neighbouring genera.\r\nThough this was somewhat drastically done in the _Species Filicum_,\r\nit comes out more prominently in the work upon which he entered in\r\nthe very last months of his life, viz. the _Synopsis Filicum_. This\r\nwork was published in 1868 as an octavo volume, with 9 coloured\r\nplates, containing analyses of 75 genera. Sir Joseph tells us (_l.c._\r\np. 117) that \"Upon this work my father was engaged up to a few days\r\nbefore his decease, and 48 pages of it in print were left on his desk,\r\ntogether with the preface and much matter in manuscript. After full\r\nconsideration it appeared to me that, with the material in hand, the\r\naid of the _Species Filicum_ completed only three years earlier, and of\r\nthe Fern Herbarium in perfect order, and named according to his views,\r\na competent botanist should find no great difficulty in carrying on\r\nthis work to its completion. Such a botanist I knew my friend Mr Baker\r\nto be, and also that he had made a study of Ferns, and accepted my\r\nfather's limitations of their genera and species. I therefore requested\r\nthat gentleman to undertake the work, which to my great satisfaction\r\nhe has done. The _Synopsis Filicum_ contains 75 genera, and about 2252\r\nspecies, inclusive of Osmundaceae, Schizaeaceae, Marattiaceae, and\r\nOphioglossaceae, which are not included in the _Species Filicum_.\" This\r\nwork summarised the Pteridological results of Sir William Hooker's\r\nlife. The total number of plates of ferns published by him is about\r\n1210, embracing 1267 species, of which about 250 appeared under the\r\njoint authorship of Dr Greville and himself. These figures are in\r\nthemselves sufficient evidence of the extent of his Pteridographic work.\r\n\r\nIt has been noted that the number of genera in the _Genera Filicum_\r\nwas 135, maintained approximately according to the limitations of\r\nPresl in his _Tentamen Pteridographiae_: allowance has, however, to\r\nbe made for 23 genera of Parkeriaceae, Schizaeaceae, Osmundaceae,\r\nMarattiaceae, Ophioglossaceae, and Lycopodiaceae, which were omitted\r\nin the _Tentamen_. But in the _Synopsis Filicum_ there were only 75.\r\nIt is true that the three genera of Lycopodiaceae were excluded also\r\nfrom the _Synopsis_, but still there is the wide discrepancy between\r\n132 of Presl's genera as against 75 in Hooker's _Synopsis_. This at\r\nonce indicates a salient feature of his method. He merged a large\r\nnumber of genera, ranking many of the smaller ones as sub-genera under\r\nthe more comprehensive headings. Doubtless the reasons for this were\r\nvarious. One was his mistrust of anatomical data, which it must be\r\nconfessed Presl put too much in the fore-front. The very first sentence\r\nof the _Tentamen_ runs thus \"Vasa plantarum principale signum esse ex\r\neo patet, quod exinde primaria divisio omnium plantarum exstitit.\"\r\nBut occasionally Sir William explained his reason in a specific case.\r\nThus in the question of Kunze's sub-genus _Plagiogyria_ of the genus\r\n_Lomaria_, which Mettenius had raised to the dignity of a distinct\r\ngenus, he explained his reasons for merging it into the genus Lomaria.\r\nMettenius had laid stress upon various characters, but especially on\r\nthe _oblique annulus_ as distinctive. On this Hooker remarks \"even\r\nshould the capsules in all the species referred to _Plagiogyria_\r\nprove to be helicogyrate, yet the habit and sori are so entirely\r\nin accordance with true _Lomaria_ that, unless the student has the\r\nopportunity of examining very perfect specimens, or unless he examines\r\nthe structure of the annulus of the very minute capsules under the high\r\npower of the microscope, the genus cannot be identified. Kunze only\r\nproposed to form a group or section under the name of _Plagiogyria_,\r\nbut even that would be found inconvenient to retain in a work whose\r\nmain object is to assist the tyro in the verification of genera\r\nand species: and natural habit is often a safer guide than minute\r\nmicroscopic characters.\" Thus we see that in his method convenience of\r\ndiagnosis is put before the use of important structural characters. I\r\nhave recently found reason to uphold the opinion of Mettenius on this\r\npoint, and to confirm _Plagiogyria_ as a substantive genus.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the genera _Lophosoria_ and _Metaxya_ will have to be\r\ndetached from _Alsophila_: Prantl removed _Microlepia_ from _Davallia_\r\ninto his new family of the _Dennstaedtiinae_, where they are related\r\nwith _Patania_ (_Dennstaedtia_), which Hooker had merged into\r\n_Dicksonia_. Goebel also has detached _Hecistopteris_ which Hooker\r\nhad placed in _Gymnogramme_, and has placed it with the _Vittarieae_.\r\nThese are all examples of the way in which further study is tending to\r\nreverse the excessive merging of genera, which Hooker carried out in\r\nthe interest of diagnostic convenience.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion which we draw from contemplating Sir William\r\nHooker's work on the systematic treatment of ferns is that it was\r\ncarried out consistently to the end under the influence of the current\r\nbelief in the Constancy of Species. The methods were not phylogenetic,\r\nas they have since become under the influence of evolutionary belief.\r\nThe problem seems to have been to depict and describe with the utmost\r\naccuracy the multitudinous representatives of the Filicales, and to\r\narrange them so that with the least possible difficulty and loss of\r\ntime any given specimen could be located and named. But the result\r\nis not to dispose them in any genetic order. Even the arrangement of\r\nthe larger genera according to the complexity of branching of the\r\nleaves appears as a method of convenience rather than of genesis,\r\nand subsequent inquiry is tending to show that so far as such series\r\nreally exist, they will require to be read in converse. Goebel, in his\r\npaper on _Hecistopteris_, remarks that \"the systematic grouping of the\r\nLeptosporangiate Ferns, as it is at present, e.g. in the _Synopsis\r\nFilicum_, is artificial throughout; it is adequate for the diagnosis\r\nof Ferns, but it does not give any satisfactory conclusion as to the\r\naffinity of the several forms.\" He proceeds to say that \"a thorough\r\ninvestigation, taking into account the general characters of form of\r\nboth the generations, will be necessary before the naturally related\r\ngroups, and their relations to one another, are recognised in the\r\nplexus of forms of the Polypodiaceae.\"\r\n\r\nSuch observations as these must not be understood in any sense of\r\ndisparagement of the work of this great man. They are merely intended\r\nto indicate his historical position. The _Origin of Species_ was, it\r\nis true, published some few years before the _Synopsis Filicum_. But\r\nwe must remember that Sir William Hooker was already an old man. Few\r\nmen over 70 years of age alter their opinions, and the labourer who\r\nhad grown old under the belief in the Constancy of Species could not\r\nin a few brief years be expected to change the methods of thought of a\r\nlong and active life. We must take Sir William Hooker as perhaps the\r\ngreatest and the last of the systematists who worked under the belief\r\nin the Constancy of Species. Because we have adopted a newer point of\r\nview, and take into consideration facts and arguments which were never\r\nhis, and come to different conclusions now, is no reason for valuing\r\none whit the less the achievements of this great botanist.\r\n\r\nHis published work was just as much fundamental as was his official\r\nwork. We have seen how he provided in Kew the means of indefinite\r\ndevelopment later, by constructing the coordinating machine with\r\nits collections and its libraries. In somewhat similar sense his\r\npublications were also fundamental. He did not himself construct. There\r\nis, I believe, no great modification of system or of view which is to\r\nbe associated with his name. But in the wealth of trustworthy detail,\r\nrecorded both pictorially and in verbal diagnoses, he has supplied the\r\nfoundation for future workers to build upon, laid surely and firmly by\r\naccurate observation, and therefore durable for all time.\r\n\r\nOne remark I may make as to the effect of his work on the trend of\r\nbotanical activity in this country. We have noted that anatomy was not\r\nSir William Hooker's strong point. He and many of his contemporaries\r\ndid not pursue microscopic detail, and indeed seem to have avoided\r\nit. He was, however, a dominating botanical influence of the middle\r\nVictorian period. May we not see in these facts, combined with the\r\nextraordinary success of the systematic work carried on by himself, or\r\nunder his guidance, a probable cause of that paralysis of laboratory\r\ninvestigation which ruled in Britain till the early seventies? British\r\nbotany was at that time almost purely descriptive. The revival came\r\nwithin 10 years of the death of Sir William, and it is well to remember\r\nthat the immediate stimulus to that revival was given by a botanist,\r\nwho became later the Director of Kew, and was allied by marriage with\r\nSir William Hooker himself. I mean, Sir William Thiselton-Dyer. The\r\nstimulus had its result in the active development of anatomical and\r\nphysiological study of plants, as we see it in this country to-day.\r\nFor a time the swing of the pendulum in this direction was too extreme\r\nand exclusive. I remember very well an occasion when Sir Joseph Hooker\r\nsaid to me, \"You young men do not know your plants.\" And it was true,\r\nthough it may be added that few indeed, at any time, knew them in the\r\nfull Hookerian sense. A saner position is gradually being attained.\r\nBut even now the systematic study of Angiosperms receives far too\r\nlittle attention among us, and is an almost open field for the young\r\ninvestigator.\r\n\r\nI would conclude with one word of advice, which naturally springs from\r\ncontemplation of a life-work such as Sir William Hooker's. We sometimes\r\nsee wide-reaching phyletic conclusions advanced by writers who we know\r\nhave not specific knowledge of the groups in question. Let us learn\r\nfrom Sir William the importance of specific knowledge. It is only on\r\nsuch a foundation that sound phyletic argument can proceed. Let us\r\nalways remember that it is better to carry out sound work on species,\r\nas he did, without theorising on their phyletic relations, than to\r\npromulgate phyletic theories without a sufficient specific knowledge of\r\nthe families themselves. The former will probably be lasting work, the\r\nlatter runs every chance of early refutation. Under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances analytical work is as a rule more durable than synthetic.\r\nSir William Hooker's contributions fall chiefly under the former head,\r\nand will be found to have a corresponding element of durability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate XIII_ JOHN STEVENS HENSLOW (1851)]\r\n\r\nJOHN STEVENS HENSLOW\r\n\r\n1796-1861\r\n\r\nBY GEORGE HENSLOW\r\n\r\n  An all-round man--appointed Professor of Mineralogy at\r\n  Cambridge in 1826, but succeeds Martyn in the Chair of Botany\r\n  a year later--essentially an ecologist--his famous teaching\r\n  methods--\"practical work\"--his wide interests--country life--the\r\n  educational museum--village amenities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scientific career and parochial life of the late Rev. Prof. J. S.\r\nHenslow, are described by my late uncle, the Rev. Leonard Jenyns, in\r\nhis _Memoir_[96]. I propose adding and illustrating some of his more\r\npersonal traits, habits and pursuits as a scientific man, and to deal\r\nespecially with his educational methods. His studies in science were\r\nby no means confined to one branch, thus Geology was first ardently\r\npursued in conjunction with Sedgwick. It was in a tour together in the\r\nIsle of Wight in 1819, that they proposed establishing a \"Corresponding\r\nSociety, for the purpose of introducing subjects of natural history\r\nto the Cambridge students.\" The outcome of this idea, which was\r\nsubsequently abandoned, was the \"Cambridge Philosophical Society,\" of\r\nwhich \"Henslow, B.A. was elected secretary in 1821[97].\"\r\n\r\nConchology and Entomology claimed his attention; one of his first\r\ndiscoveries was the rare insect _Macroplea equiseti_, his identical\r\n\"find\" being figured in Curtis' _British Entomology_, while he found\r\nthe bivalve _Cyclas Henslowiana_, so named by Dr Leach, at Baitsbite\r\non the Cam. His first and best collection of insects was presented to\r\nthe Cambridge Philosophical Society. Other discoveries were made in\r\nafter years, and are referred to by Jenyns.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Dr E. D. Clarke, he offered himself for the\r\nProfessorship of Mineralogy. Chemistry, as well as the study of\r\nMinerals, now occupied his attention. He was only 26 years of age, and\r\nstill B.A., when elected to that chair. At the age of 27 he published\r\nhis _Syllabus of Mineralogy_ in 1823, \"A useful manual of reference\r\nto all persons studying Mineralogy, independently of the immediate\r\ncircumstances which led to its publication[98].\"\r\n\r\nIn 1827 Prof. Martyn died and Prof. Henslow was elected to the chair\r\nof Botany, being succeeded by Whewell on resigning the Professorship\r\nof Mineralogy. He now turned his attention to the study of Botany; but\r\nhe never paid much heed to systematic botany, for his taste lay in the\r\ndirection of what is now called Ecology. He then wrote \"Botanists would\r\nrather receive one of our most common weeds from a newly-discovered\r\nor newly-explored country, than a new species of an already known\r\ngenus. There are higher departments of Botany than mere collectors of\r\nspecimens are aware of; for to ascertain the geographical distribution\r\nof a well-known species is a point of vastly superior interest to\r\nthe mere acquisition of a rare specimen.\" _À propos_ of this he made\r\nelaborate epitomes of the Botanical Geographies of De Candolle, and\r\nof the writings of Humboldt, Poiret and others. His MS. is not unlike\r\na fore-runner of Schimper's _Botanical Geography_ of to-day. He\r\nthus expressed himself in the Introduction to his _Descriptive and\r\nPhysiological Botany_ (1836):--in the second section headed _Botany_\r\n... \"This enquiry should extend as well to the investigation of the\r\noutward forms [of plant organs] and the conditions in which plants,\r\nwhether recent or fossil, are met with, as to the examination of the\r\nvarious functions which they perform whilst in the living state and\r\nto the laws by which their distribution on the earth's surface is\r\nregulated.\" Again, in the Preface to the _Flora of Suffolk_ by himself\r\nand E. S. Skepper, he wrote:--\"We had thought of saying something in\r\nregard to the Geographic distribution of the species, but found our\r\nmaterial insufficient for treating this question to advantage.\" As\r\nan alternative he suggests interleaving the 'Catalogue,' as the book\r\nwas also called, in which observers could add observations on the\r\nGeological formations and superficial soils upon which each species\r\ngrows, e.g. Chalk, the Crags, Gravels of post-tertiary period, &c. as\r\nwell as maritime, marshy, boggy, healthy and cultivated soils[99].\r\n\r\nThough he wrote against _mere_ collecting, he was an insatiable\r\ncollector himself; but it was always with some definite, useful and\r\ngenerally educational purpose, and the _best_ of his collections\r\ninvariably went to museums, especially those of the Philosophical\r\nSociety of Cambridge, of Kew and of Ipswich. The first still has the\r\nfishes he collected at Weymouth in 1832, solely for his brother-in-law\r\nL. Jenyns, the author of _The British Vertebrate Animals_.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things to which his attention was directed was the\r\nCambridge Botanic Garden. It was far too small and in the centre of\r\nthe town, where the scientific buildings are now erected. He urged the\r\nnecessity of a new one, but it was not till 1831 that the present site\r\nwas secured; the first tree, however, was not planted until 1846.\r\n\r\nHis educational method of teaching was totally different from the mere\r\ninstructional method of all previous lecturers. To cram up facts was\r\nthe students' duty in the Medical schools, where botany was supposed\r\nto be taught. To learn by their own discovery was his new method, and\r\nso each student educated himself by examining and recording plant\r\nstructures first seen by his own dissections. Having long been in the\r\nhabit of observing himself, he was early convinced of the importance of\r\npractical work and he always had \"demonstrations,\" as he called them,\r\nfrom living specimens. Each member of the class had a round wooden\r\nplate for dissecting upon. He had only sixteen lectures to give, but he\r\nsucceeded in arousing an enthusiasm in some, and interest in all who\r\nattended, and thus many came besides undergraduates, as Dr Ainslie, the\r\nMaster of Pembroke.\r\n\r\nThe value of \"practical work\" put a stop to cram, and he was the first\r\nto introduce the examination of flowers, not only at Cambridge but\r\nfor the degrees in the University of London. \"He insisted,\" wrote Dr\r\nHooker, \"that a knowledge of physiological botany, technical terms,\r\nminute anatomy, &c. were not subjects by which a candidate's real\r\nknowledge could be tested, for the longest memory must win the day, the\r\nless did it test the observing or reasoning faculties of the men. He,\r\ntherefore, insisted in all his examinations that the men should dissect\r\nspecimens, describe their organs systematically and be prepared to\r\nexplain their relations, uses and significations in a physiological and\r\nclassificatory point of view; and thus prove that they had used their\r\neyes, hands and heads, as well as their books[100].\"\r\n\r\nHis natural bent and interest were in the investigations of the\r\nphenomena of plant-life, e.g. the colours of flowers, the laws of\r\nphyllotaxis and what would now be called biometrical studies, e.g.\r\nof the variations in the leaves of _Paris_ and the cotyledons of the\r\nsycamore, hybridization, teratology and the origin of varieties, etc.\r\nThe geographical distribution of plants and the effects of external\r\nagencies upon them were also specially studied, as is recorded in the\r\nnote-book mentioned. He was thus a genuine Ecologist without knowing\r\nit. He published about 50 papers on botanical subjects during his\r\nprofessorship from 1825 to 1861, in which he was more than once the\r\npioneer of special branches of study since taken up, as in the above\r\nmentioned hybridization and varietal differences under cultivation,\r\netc.; for experiments were made on the specific identity between the\r\nPrimrose, Oxlip, Cowslip and Polyanthus. He raised many varieties,\r\nwhich were often permanent or \"Mutations\"; though sometimes reversions\r\nappeared, concluding that when one form thus changed to another that\r\nwas sufficient proof of identity.\r\n\r\nThough his occupations were necessarily much changed at Hitcham, of\r\nwhich he became the Rector in 1838, from those at Cambridge, he by\r\nno means neglected science; but he utilized it in different ways.\r\nThus having a good knowledge of chemistry, he endeavoured to make the\r\nfarmers interested in more scientific methods of farming than they had\r\nbeen accustomed to. He gave lectures on the fermentation of manures and\r\nhe wrote fifteen \"Letters to Farmers,\" first published in the _Bury\r\nPost_ and then separately. He even proposed that they should make\r\nexperiments themselves. For this purpose he issued schedules to about\r\n70 farmers who asked for them.\r\n\r\nThe experiment was to test Liebig's suggestion that gypsum should be\r\nadded to manure heaps to fix the ammonia. Unfortunately there is no\r\nrecord of the results[101].\r\n\r\nThe most important discovery from an industrial point of view, due to\r\nhis knowledge of Geology, was undoubtedly that of the phosphate nodules\r\nknown in the trade as \"Coprolite,\" at Felixstowe in 1843, when he and\r\nhis family were staying there. The cliffs are formed of \"London clay,\"\r\ntopped by the \"Red Crag,\" between which is a bed of rolled, brown\r\npebbles, once, with the crag, forming an ancient beach. Where the white\r\n\"Coralline[102]\" Crag occurs, the pebble bed lies _below_ it. This\r\naccounts for the fact that it contains remains of Miocene animals, such\r\nas teeth of the Hipparion, or ancestor of the horse.\r\n\r\nAs the sea is always encroaching, the cliff has much \"talus\" in\r\nplaces, upon which was strewed the debris from the crag, including\r\nvast quantities of pebbles. Observing that they often contained a\r\nshark's tooth or other organic remains, he suspected that they might be\r\ncomposed partly of phosphate of lime. This proved to be the case, for\r\nthe first analysis made by Mr Potter of Lambeth showed 54% (1844). He\r\ncommunicated the fact to Mr, subsequently Sir, John Bennet Lawes, who\r\ndesired a ton of nodules to be forwarded to him for experiment. This\r\nled to their becoming a recognised article of trade. Large fortunes\r\nhave been realised in Suffolk by owners of land containing the nodule\r\nbed, though frequently occurring at a considerable depth.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 he advocated the use of phosphate nodules in the \"Greensand\"\r\nbeds of Cambridgeshire. These also soon became a commercial commodity.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Professor Henslow delivered the inaugural address on the\r\nfoundation of the Ipswich Museum, the object being, for \"Giving\r\nInstruction to the working Classes in Ipswich in various branches of\r\nScience and more especially Natural History.\" It affords the best\r\nexample of his views generally upon the uses of Science, not only as\r\nbeing of indisputable value in all useful arts, but as a means of\r\neducation by dispelling the then prevailing ignorance and harmful\r\nprejudices rife in those days, even among men learned in other subjects\r\nat our Universities.\r\n\r\nHe illustrates his remarks from the chief sciences, as in Astronomy,\r\nby its importance in understanding the laws of storms and tides, which\r\nWhewell was then studying. Agriculture was touched upon, in showing\r\nthe importance of a knowledge of Vegetable Physiology, and illustrated\r\nby the parasites, yellow Rattle and Wheat-rust. He insisted upon the\r\neducational value of accuracy, demanded of the scientist, and the\r\navoiding _a priori_ assumptions and hastily drawn deductions from\r\ninsufficient data. But even the philosopher himself does not always\r\nescape from the imputation; for the farmers at Hitcham were firmly\r\nconvinced that the \"Piperage\" or Barberry _itself_ blighted the wheat.\r\nThe Professor could not convince them that the red colour of the spots\r\non the leaves of the bush was not due to the same fungus as that on\r\nthe wheat. Indeed, he observes (in a MS.): \"It is not likely (as some\r\nsuppose) that it is due to the influence of _Æcidium berberidis_.\" We\r\nnow know that the farmers were nearer the truth and the botanists were\r\nwrong. But one point the Professor established--and I possess his dried\r\nspecimens to this day--and that was, that the \"mildew,\" a black fungus,\r\nsubsequently arises from the same substratum or mycelium as the rust.\r\nThe mildew, then, throws off orange-coloured dust-like \"spores,\" which\r\nattack the Barberry, and so the cycle is completed[103].\r\n\r\nI still possess his dried specimens of other species of _Æcidium_\r\nattacking various kinds of plants, which he collected for comparison\r\nwith that of the Barberry.\r\n\r\nAs abortive attempts to find coal had been made in some counties, he\r\npointed out the value of Geology in at least intimating where coal was\r\npossible and also where it was impossible. It was not, he said, that a\r\n\"little knowledge is a dangerous thing,\" as no one would become learned\r\nif he did not begin with a little, but it was the hasty deductions that\r\nwere valueless and often dangerous.\r\n\r\nAs a practical illustration of this under the false assumption that the\r\nroots made the \"bulb\" of mangold-wurzel, he noticed the common practice\r\nof stripping off the leaves of plants, and explained to them that\r\nunless they were required for fodder, it was a wasteful practice, as\r\nthe leaves (and not the roots, as they supposed) were the makers of the\r\n\"bulbs.\" Indeed, in 1860, Prof. Jas. Buckman proved that it lessens the\r\nweight of mangold-wurzel by nearly one half.\r\n\r\nScience was not even shut out at the Hitcham Horticultural Society's\r\nExhibitions, for he always had his own marquee erected and a large\r\nboard over the entrance with \"The Marquee Museum\" upon it, the letters\r\nbeing composed of Hitcham fresh-water mussel shells. During the day of\r\nthe show, he would deliver \"lecturets\" from time to time on the various\r\nspecimens exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe following are samples of the latter. Cases of land and fresh-water\r\nshells of Hitcham. Photographs of microscopic objects enlarged,\r\nincluding the _first_ ever made, by the Rev. H. Kingsley, Tutor of\r\nSidney College, Camb. in 1855. A case containing living specimens\r\nof the smallest British Mammal, the harvest mouse. Pearls from\r\nBritish molluscs. The slow-worm and viper in spirits, to show their\r\ndifferences. Hornets' and wasps' nests, naturally mounted, taken by\r\nhimself, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Monday afternoon lessons in botany in the village school-room,\r\nheld after school-hours, were always remarkable for the enthusiasm\r\nexhibited by the children. They were perfectly voluntary, but none\r\nwas admitted to the Third Class until the child had learnt to spell\r\ncorrectly thirteen terms of classification of the classes, divisions\r\nand sections. On entering the class they at once began to fill up the\r\n\"Floral Schedule[104].\"\r\n\r\nThe botanical lesson included:--\r\n\r\n1st--Inspection of specimens, anything special noticed and explained.\r\n\r\n2nd--\"Hard word\" exercises. Two or three words (botanical terms) given\r\nto be correctly spelt on the next Monday.\r\n\r\n3rd--Specimens examined and dissected and floral schedules, traced on\r\nslates, to be filled up. Marks allowed for accuracy, etc.\r\n\r\n4th--Questions on the plant \"organs.\"\r\n\r\nBotanical excursions were made for those only who had received a\r\nsufficient number of marks.\r\n\r\nThe First Class came at certain times to the rectory on Sunday\r\nafternoons after Divine Service; when objects of natural history were\r\nshown and \"such accounts given of them as may tend to improve our\r\nmeans of better appreciating the wisdom, power, and goodness of the\r\nCreator[105].\"\r\n\r\nA printed list of all the wild flowers in Hitcham was always suspended\r\nin the school-room, and a rack for named phials, which the children had\r\nto keep supplied with flowers as they came into blossom. Of course,\r\nlittle rewards were given to those who first found a flower and those\r\nwho supplied the greater number, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of the exhibits of the Horticultural Shows was the collections of\r\nwild flowers made by the children. In addition, a public examination in\r\nbotany was held, and a stranger would often find it a difficult matter\r\nto puzzle one of the best pupils, not merely as to the name--a trivial\r\nmatter--but as to the structure of the flower itself.\r\n\r\nThe Government Inspector in 1858, wrote as follows in his\r\nReport:--\"Extra subjects, pretty fair, and among them Botany,\r\n_excellent_; this last being most thoroughly yet simply taught, and by\r\nsuch a system that there can be no cram. As far as a child goes, it\r\nmust _know_ what it does. _The good moral effect of this study on the\r\nminds of the children is very apparent._\"\r\n\r\nIn those days, I am speaking of the \"fifties,\" Darwin had not\r\nenlightened us as to the wonderful adaptations of flowers for\r\nfertilization by insects. This adds enormously to the interest of\r\nthe study--as the present writer soon found with village children\r\nof the parishes in which he has lived, and taught them botany--but\r\neven without that attraction the Hitcham children were intensely\r\nenthusiastic.\r\n\r\nThe Professor also taught them how to dry plants. The village\r\nHerbarium, containing all the plants growing wild in Hitcham, was\r\nentirely made by them.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked by cynics, \"What can be the _use_ of teaching science\r\nto such children?\" It is not the mere fact that a child knows\r\nthe structure of a rose, but it is the training in _accuracy of\r\nobservation, mind and habit_, which the minute and close observation\r\ndemands, i.e. if it be properly taught, and to secure that, is all\r\nimportant in children, who are naturally inattentive and inaccurate\r\nin consequence. In teaching them botany as described above, the child\r\nis trained to avoid this bad habit in an interesting way, because\r\ninattention is solely due to want of interest.\r\n\r\nThe Ipswich Museum was a great source of pleasure to him. As President\r\nhe carried out his plan of making it a \"typical\" museum, never letting\r\nit degenerate into a mere show, as so many country museums are, or at\r\nleast used to be.\r\n\r\nThe Ipswich Museum has been a model for all others in that typical\r\nseries of fossils, etc., are exhibited in the visible cases, all others\r\nbeing relegated to drawers, for students to examine. In allusion to\r\nthe uses of Museums in his inaugural address referred to above, he\r\nremarked:--\"Our collections should be viewed as the means of assisting\r\nus in the acquisition of real knowledge, and not merely to be gazed\r\nat as raree shows, or as only valuable in proportion to the number or\r\nscarcity of the objects they contain.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, periodical lectures were delivered by the Professor at\r\nIpswich, and he was a most lucid and admirable exponent.\r\n\r\nHe was the first to maintain that in museums of animals, they should,\r\nwhenever possible, as, e.g. with birds, be represented in their natural\r\nconditions. With this object he collected nests with the boughs, or\r\nwhatever it was in which they rested. Since then this plan has been\r\nadmirably carried out at the Natural History Museum, South Kensington.\r\nHe also supplied several museums with wasps' and hornets' nests with\r\ntheir surroundings. The plan he discovered most convenient for taking\r\nthem, was to saturate tow with spirits of turpentine and place it at\r\nnight in the hole, covered over with an inverted and corked flower-pot.\r\nThe nest could then be dug up with impunity, as all the wasps were dead\r\nor torpid by the following morning. He always preserved the \"pavement\"\r\nor bottom-soil covered with stones which accumulated as the hollow for\r\nthe nest increased in size. The nest was then suspended over it on rods\r\nto show the exact position. It was also half-dissected, to exhibit the\r\ninterior, all the grubs having been carefully extracted. The village\r\ncarpenter, the late Mr W. Baker, was a most enthusiastic assistant in\r\ntaking and mounting the specimens.\r\n\r\nWhen the potato famine occurred in Ireland in 1845-46, the disease was\r\nvery prevalent in Hitcham. This induced the Professor to explain to\r\nhis parishioners and others--for he published his recommendations--how\r\nthey could utilise their rotten potatoes by extracting the valuable\r\nstarch, which still remained sound within the tubers, even when these\r\nwere refused by pigs. The process is so simple that it may be mentioned\r\nhere. The potatoes must be _grated_ (a piece of tin with holes punched\r\nthrough it will do); the pulp is then stirred with a stream of cold\r\nwater through a hair-sieve. The _brown_ water must be allowed a few\r\nminutes for the starch, carried through, to settle. The water is\r\npoured off, and the layer of starch must be stirred up and washed\r\nwith fresh cold water. This may be done two or three times, till it\r\nbecomes perfectly white. It must then be carefully dried in the sun\r\nor in a warm room (our method was to hang it up in small muslin bags\r\nin the kitchen); the bags must be repeatedly \"kneaded\" to prevent its\r\nclotting. When perfectly dry, it will keep for any length of time. Of\r\ncourse, it is precisely the same thing as sago, tapioca, cornflour,\r\narrowroot, etc. and can be used like them. All our potatoes in the\r\nRectory garden were rotten, but we recovered at least two sacks of\r\nstarch. I remember taking a large sponge-cake to school, more or less\r\nmade with this potato-flour, and making my reverend master somewhat\r\nincredulous by telling him it was made out of rotten potatoes!\r\n\r\nProfessor Henslow printed and circulated the receipt for the extraction\r\nof starch, in the village; so that several, who thought it worth while,\r\nobtained considerable quantities of starch.\r\n\r\nIn one of his lectures, dealing with this subject, he pointed out how a\r\ngood basin of \"arrowroot\" can be made in ten minutes from two or three\r\nfair-sized potatoes; for as soon as the starch has been thoroughly\r\n\"washed,\" it is ready for the boiling milk. It is essential the milk\r\nor water should be actually boiling, or the granules of starch do not\r\nburst and so make the required \"jelly.\"\r\n\r\nThe school children of Hitcham were by no means left out in the cold\r\nas to the knowledge of natural phenomena. They were early instructed\r\nas to the harmless nature of toads and slow-worms, which were very\r\nabundant, on the one hand; and of the danger of handling a viper, on\r\nthe other. This last is the only poisonous reptile in England, and\r\neasily recognisable by the lozenge-shaped marks down the back. Having\r\nspecimens in spirit, they had no excuse for confounding them; but, as\r\nalways happens with children, if there is an alternative of any sort\r\nbetween which they are well taught the difference, some one is sure to\r\nget them transposed in his memory. Consequently, a boy came up to the\r\nRectory with his arm greatly swollen; he had been bitten by a viper\r\nwhich he had taken up, thinking it was a slow-worm, _because_, as he\r\nsaid, it had the marks along its back!\r\n\r\nBesides the tiny harvest mice, he at one time possessed for some two\r\nor three years two \"pet\" Jersey toads, or the great _crapaud_. They\r\nwere kept in a wire-gauze cage, and it was our delight as children\r\nto feed these monsters every morning. A butterfly net swept over the\r\nlawn was sure to secure all sorts of flying and jumping creatures. The\r\nlid of the cage being lifted up, the net was turned inside out over\r\nthe toads, and quickly closed. Then began the matutinal breakfast.\r\nThey would never notice anything that did not move. Seeing, however,\r\nsay a grasshopper, stir, the toad would stalk it like a cat after a\r\nbird; and when within tongue-shot, out came its long tongue like a\r\nflash of lightning, and the grasshopper vanished in the flash. Worms\r\nwere a great delight. Snapping up one in the middle, the two ends were\r\ncarefully cleaned from earth by passing them between the toes two or\r\nthree times; then followed a mighty gulp, and all was over.\r\n\r\nShell-traps were always laid about the grass, consisting of slates,\r\nunder which there would generally be found a various crop of sorts.\r\nI have now two glass cases containing all the shells, land and\r\nfresh-water, of Hitcham, mounted by the Professor himself. A reward was\r\noffered for every specimen of a Helix with the shell reversed. They\r\nare very rare, but one was brought by a little boy who discovered it,\r\nfor he found he was unable to get his thumb into the opening the right\r\nway when playing at \"conquerors.\" So he got the only sixpence earned\r\nin twenty-three years that the Professor was incumbent of Hitcham. The\r\ncollection of butterflies was always being added to; now and then a\r\nrare one would appear at Hitcham, as, e.g. the Camberwell Beauty. The\r\nProfessor was walking in the Rectory garden with the late Judge Eagle,\r\nof Bury St Edmunds, when one settled on a wall. Mr Eagle stood sentry\r\nwhile the Professor ran indoors for his net. It need hardly be added\r\nthat the specimen still rests in the collection, which passed into the\r\npossession of his son-in-law, the late Sir J. D. Hooker, F.R.S., etc.\r\n\r\nI cannot do better than conclude with my uncle's words at the end\r\nof his _Memoir_:--\"When a good man dies the world does not cease to\r\nbenefit from those labours of love which he undertook for his fellow\r\nmen. Though personally removed from them his example remains; his voice\r\ntoo, is still heard in the lessons left to be handed down to those who\r\ncome after him. The influences of Professor Henslow's teaching have\r\nbeen felt in other places than those in which he himself taught, they\r\nhave borne fruit far beyond the obscure neighbourhood in which he first\r\nsowed the good seed, and who shall say to what further results they\r\nmay not grow in years to come, bringing honour to his memory, and what\r\nis far more, glory to God? '_'A word spoken in due season, how good is\r\nit!_'\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[96] _Memoir of the Rev. John Stevens Henslow, M.A., F.L.S., F.G.S.,\r\nF.C.P.S._ (J.

During that period the foundations of\r\nplant-anatomy were laid afresh with the cell as the builders' material.\r\nThe discovery of sarcode or protoplasm electrified the scientific world\r\nand excited the attention of the philosophical novelist--as readers of\r\n_Middlemarch_ may remember. The nucleus, the only and true _deus ex\r\nmachina_ of many a modern botanist, was recognised as an organ of the\r\ncell.\r\n\r\nBiochemistry came into being and, with Liebig as foster-parent, grew\r\ninto modern Physiology. The natural system of classification proclaimed\r\nby Jussieu put to rout the old established Linnean system and the\r\nenunciation of the theory of Natural Selection brought the epoch to a\r\ndramatic close.\r\n\r\nIn the constructive work of this period British botanists played a\r\ndistinguished part, and it was due preeminently to them that the\r\ntransition from the old artificial system to the new natural system\r\ntook place so speedily and completely.\r\n\r\nThe group of men to whose labours this great change was due include\r\nHooker, Brown, Bentham and the subject of this sketch, John Lindley.\r\nNor from this brief list may the name of Sir Joseph Banks, \"the\r\ngreatest Englishman of his time,\" be omitted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate XIV_ JOHN LINDLEY (1848)]\r\n\r\nThe commanding position to which these men attained in the world of\r\nscience was of course due, primarily, to their ability and--equally of\r\ncourse--to circumstance. The great wars were over and in the peaceful\r\nyears men were free to turn their energy to constructive purposes.\r\nHorticulture--ever a British art--became unreservedly popular.\r\nExplorers and collectors, encouraged and assisted by Banks and others,\r\nsent home rich supplies of new or rare plants and thus provided\r\nBritish systematists with a vast array of material for their work of\r\nreconstructing the flora of the world. Such brilliant use was made of\r\nopportunity that our country took the lead in systematic botany.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the collector, the generosity of the patron and the\r\nlabour of the systematist led not only to a general advance in methods\r\nof classification but also to a very special advance in the knowledge\r\nof what is, in many ways, the most interesting group of plants on\r\nthe face of the earth--the Orchidaceae. Among the plant-treasure\r\nfrom India, Australia and Malaya were large numbers of epiphytic\r\norchids. The problem of cultivating such strange and fascinating\r\nplants challenged the skill of the gardener. The \"fancying\" instinct,\r\nlatent in every Englishman and curiously characteristic of the race,\r\nwas evoked by the bizarre form of these plants. Orchid-growing became\r\nthe hobby of the well-to-do. Gardeners with no knowledge of science\r\nand regardless of text-book dicta on sterility, proceeded to raise\r\nthe most marvellous series of hybrids--bi-generic, tri-generic,\r\nmulti-generic--which any sane and scholastic botanist would have\r\ndeclared to be impossible.\r\n\r\nBrown, Blume and above all Lindley threw themselves with enthusiasm\r\ninto the task of discovering the clues to the classification of these\r\nplants, the form of whose flowers transgress so glaringly the rules of\r\nmorphology--dimly surmising perhaps that if the key to evolution is\r\never to be found it will be discovered by the study of the group of\r\nplants which appear to represent evolution's latest prank.\r\n\r\nIn building up the new system of classification of the vegetable\r\nkingdom in general and of orchids in particular, Lindley bore a\r\nconspicuous part; and were these his only contributions to the\r\nadvancement of botanical science, his biographer might find the task\r\nof writing his life one of no very great difficulty. When however\r\nhe discovers the many other varied aspects of Lindley's activities,\r\nthe biographer may well despair of presenting a fair picture of\r\nthe scientific life of this remarkable man. Professor of Botany in\r\nUniversity College, London, \"Præfectus Horti\" to the Society of\r\nApothecaries, officially attached to the Royal Horticultural Society\r\nand responsible for the management of its gardens, and in no small\r\nmeasure for its very existence, Lindley yet found time to become\r\neasily the greatest scientific journalist of his age. For nearly 25\r\nyears he edited the _Gardeners' Chronicle_ and did more than any other\r\nman to keep the science and practice of horticulture on good terms\r\nwith one another. To those of us who know how generally the cares\r\nof organisation give excuse for slackness in research, Lindley's\r\nindomitable activity, both in administration and in investigation,\r\nbecomes indeed impressive and inspiring. Lecturing, drawing and\r\ndescribing new genera and species, revising the vegetable kingdom,\r\nwriting memoirs, text-books, articles, directing the gardens at\r\nChiswick, fighting officialdom and obstruction, building up a great\r\nherbarium and discharging a dozen other duties would seem to have made\r\nup the daily life of this man of amazing vigour. Till he was 50 years\r\nof age Lindley never knew what it was to feel fatigue; at 52 he took\r\nhis first holiday; but the continuous strain of half a century had\r\nexhausted him beyond recuperation. He rallied, set to work again, again\r\nbroke down and died at the age of 67.\r\n\r\nTo sketch in rapid outline and to admire to the full, John Lindley's\r\nlife is not difficult even to the modern botanist whose life is passed\r\nin the cloistered calm of the laboratory; but to give a discriminating\r\naccount of the chief of Lindley's services to science is well-nigh\r\nimpossible for any one man: certainly I could not have undertaken\r\nit unaided. Good fortune and friends however rendered the attempt\r\nunnecessary. In the first place, Lord Lindley, when he knew of this\r\nproject, put at my disposal in the kindest manner possible an outline\r\nof John Lindley's career which he had written under the title of\r\n\"Sketch of my Father's Life: written for my sons, daughters and\r\ngrandchildren.\" In what follows I have made free use of Lord Lindley's\r\nmanuscript. In the second place, Mr W. Botting Hemsley has had the\r\ngreat kindness not only to supply me with much valuable information\r\nof which he was possessed concerning Lindley's scientific work but to\r\nexamine manuscripts, letters, etc. at Kew bearing thereon and to allow\r\nme to make use of the results of his interesting investigations.\r\n\r\nHence my task has become merely that of an editor whose chief duty is\r\nto fit the material provided by two distinguished contributors into\r\nthe prescribed space. Whatever credit is due to this first attempt to\r\nsketch the career of Lindley, belongs to these two gentlemen whose\r\nremarkable kindness I have great pleasure in acknowledging.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Outline of Career._\r\n\r\nJohn Lindley was born on February 5, 1799, in Catton near Norwich. His\r\nfather, George Lindley, who came of an old Yorkshire family, conducted\r\na large nursery and fruit business in Catton. To the facts that John\r\nLindley became in early years an accomplished field botanist and also\r\nlearned much of practical horticulture may be ascribed the close touch\r\nwhich he maintained throughout his botanical career with the practical\r\nside of botany. It is not too much to say that John Lindley was the\r\nunique representative of a class of man which he himself declared\r\nhad never existed, namely one which combined the qualities of a good\r\nphysiologist with those of a practical gardener of the greatest\r\nexperience. John Lindley's youthful ambition was however to be not a\r\nsavant but a soldier, and though, owing to the inability of his father\r\nto buy him a commission, that ambition was not fulfilled, the instinct\r\nwhich prompted it found frequent expression throughout Lindley's life.\r\nAs his career demonstrates, he was a first class fighting man. The\r\ncurious may find in the pages of the _Gardeners' Chronicle_ records of\r\nthe combats which he waged on behalf of horticulture and we shall have\r\noccasion presently to refer to the most important of all his campaigns\r\nin the cause of science.\r\n\r\nWhen John Lindley was about 19 or 20 years of age his father's affairs\r\nbecame involved, and the son with an impulsiveness as just as it was\r\nfoolish insisted, against the advice of friends, on becoming surety for\r\nthe father. The mill-stone of financial anxiety thus early hung about\r\nhis neck caused him trouble throughout his life.\r\n\r\nPossessed of nothing but youth, a sound education, great natural\r\nability and one good friend, John Lindley at the age of 20 left Norfolk\r\nfor London. Thanks to a letter of introduction from the friend (Sir\r\nWilliam Hooker) he obtained a post as assistant-librarian to Sir Joseph\r\nBanks. He thus gained access to a good library and became acquainted\r\nwith a large number of men, both English and foreign, interested in\r\nscientific subjects. That he made the most of his opportunities is\r\nevident, for we find him at 21 a Fellow of the Linnean Society and a\r\nmember of the Bonn Academy of Natural History. In 1822 began Lindley's\r\nlong connection with the Horticultural Society, which he served first\r\nas Garden Assistant-Secretary, then (1826-1860) as Assistant-Secretary\r\nand finally as Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe portrait which accompanies this sketch is a reproduction of that\r\npainted by Mr Eddis, R.A., at the instance of friends of Lindley about\r\nthe time of his resignation of the Secretaryship of the Horticultural\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous direct services rendered by Lindley to the Society\r\nwere the laying out of the Society's garden at Chiswick and the\r\norganisation, with Bentham, of the celebrated flower-shows which have\r\nserved as models for the exhibits of horticultural societies all over\r\nthe world. Those who know how extraordinarily valuable, not only to\r\nhorticulturists but also to botanists, are the periodical \"shows\" held\r\nby the Royal Horticultural Society, will be grateful to Lindley for the\r\nperspicuity which led him to replace the old and gaudy \"fêtes\" by these\r\nadmirable exhibitions.\r\n\r\nLindley's Professorship of Botany in University College, London, dates\r\nfrom 1828 and was held for over a quarter of a century. Among those\r\nwho attended his lectures were Carpenter, Edwin Lankester, Griffith,\r\nDaubeny and Williamson. His lectureship to the Society of Apothecaries\r\nbegan in 1835, and in 1841 in which year the _Gardeners' Chronicle_ was\r\nfounded, he became editor of that periodical. This post he held till\r\nhis death in 1865.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the multifariousness and onerousness of\r\nLindley's official and routine duties left little time for other work.\r\nYet Lindley made time not only for scientific investigation and for the\r\nwriting of numerous monographs and text-books; but also for a large and\r\nvaried amount of public work. In the Lindley correspondence preserved\r\nat Kew are to be found letters and papers (official correspondence\r\n1832-1854) criticising trenchantly the mismanagement of the Royal\r\nforests and recommendations on the selection and cultivation of trees\r\nfor the charcoal employed in the manufacture of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nLindley, together with Hooker, acted as adviser to the Commissioners of\r\nthe Admiralty with respect to the planting of the Island of Ascension.\r\n\r\nThe potato famine was the occasion of an official visit to Ireland\r\nand led to a report by Lindley, Sir Robert Kave and Sir Lyon Playfair\r\nwhich was the immediate cause of the Repeal of the Corn Laws. As Sir\r\nRobert Peel told Lindley \"in the face of the Report, the repeal could\r\nno longer be avoided.\" Thus the potato takes rank with the chance word,\r\nthe common soldier, the girl at the door of an inn that have changed or\r\nalmost changed the fate of nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lindley and Kew._\r\n\r\nBut of all Lindley's public works that which he undertook for the\r\nsaving of Kew from destruction is of the most immediate interest to\r\nbotanists. In 1838 a small committee consisting of Lindley, Paxton and\r\nJ. Wilson (gardener to the Earl of Surrey) were commissioned to report\r\non the state of the Royal Gardens. After exposing the incompetence and\r\nextravagance of the then administration Lindley recommended that the\r\nRoyal Gardens, Kew, should be made over to the nation and should become\r\nthe headquarters of botanical science for England, its Colonies and\r\nDependencies. Is it due to our lack of gratitude or to our mistrust\r\nof sculptors, that no statue of Lindley stands in the grounds of Kew?\r\nIn 1840 John Lindley was able to write to Sir William Hooker: \"It is\r\nrumoured that you are appointed to Kew. If so I shall have still more\r\nreason to rejoice at the determination I took to oppose the barbarous\r\nTreasury scheme of destroying the place; for I of course was aware\r\nthat the stand I made and the opposition I created would destroy all\r\npossibility of my receiving any appointment.\" Having regard to the part\r\nwhich Lindley played in preserving Kew from the devastating clutches\r\nof the politicians it is but fit that that Institution should contain\r\nthe most valuable of Lindley's scientific possessions, his orchid\r\nherbarium,--that his general herbarium is at Cambridge may be news to\r\nsuch Cambridge botanists as in the days of a decade or two ago learned\r\nBotany without such adventitious aids.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 Lindley wrote to the late Sir Joseph Hooker to say that he\r\nhad made up his mind to sell his herbarium and would prefer that the\r\nOrchids went to Kew. There it is preserved, a monument of Lindley's\r\nskill and industry and of inestimable value to the systematist. Besides\r\nthe actual specimens it contains coloured drawings of the flowers of\r\nall the species that came under his observation in the living state. In\r\naddition to the herbarium, Kew possesses a large amount of Lindley's\r\nscientific correspondence; letters to W. J. Hooker, 1828-1859 (230),\r\n182 letters to Bentham and 35 to Henslow, and others to which reference\r\nhas been made already: altogether an invaluable mass of correspondence,\r\nselections from which it is to be hoped may some day see the light of\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nLindley's skill with brush and pencil may be admired in the many plates\r\nwhich he executed in illustration of his various monographs. His skill\r\nwith the pen deserves at least remark. Inasmuch however as nearly all\r\nthe more distinguished of the old school of botanists, Hales, Hooker,\r\nGray, to mention but a few, have in this respect a marked superiority\r\nover their successors, it is not necessary to labour the question of\r\nliterary grace for either the moderns are indifferent on the subject\r\nor they may find on every hand models ready for their use. Two\r\ncitations from the introductory pages of Lindley's classic, _The Theory\r\nand Practice of Horticulture_, must suffice to exemplify his incisive\r\nstyle--Le style c'est l'homme, and Lindley the man hated circumlocution\r\nand had no time to waste--\"there are, doubtless, many men of cultivated\r\nor idle minds who think waiting upon Providence much better than any\r\nattempt to improve their condition by the exertion of their reasoning\r\nfaculties. For such persons books are not written\"; and again, with\r\nreference to the divorce in current literature between theory and\r\npractice, \"Horticulture is by these means rendered a very complicated\r\nsubject, so that none but practical gardeners can hope to pursue it\r\nsuccessfully; and like all empirical things, it is degraded into a code\r\nof peremptory precepts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Publications._ \"_The Theory and Practice of Horticulture._\"\r\n\r\nThough many aspects of Lindley's work must perforce be treated of\r\nin briefest form no sketch could have the slenderest value which\r\ndid not take into account his chief works, _The Theory and Practice\r\nof Horticulture_, _The Vegetable Kingdom_, and the _Botanical\r\nRegister_; nor from a survey no matter how brief may reference to his\r\ncontributions to our knowledge of orchids be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe value of Lindley's great work on _The Theory and Practice of\r\nHorticulture_ may be best gauged by the fact that as a statement\r\nof horticultural principles it is the best book extant. Though\r\nthe botanist of the present day finds on perusing this work that\r\nphysiological knowledge in 1840 was in a singularly crude state, and\r\nmay rejoice at the rapid progress of discovery since the time when\r\nLindley's book was written, yet the fact remains that few, if any, men\r\nat the present day could make a better statement of the physiological\r\nprinciples underlying practical horticulture than that presented by\r\nJohn Lindley.\r\n\r\nIndeed it is a strange fact, and one worthy of the attention of our\r\nphysiologists, that the gardeners are still endeavouring to puzzle\r\nout for themselves the reasons for their practices unaided by the\r\nphysiologists. An interesting illustration of this assertion may\r\nbe found in recent issues of the _Gardeners' Chronicle_ containing\r\ncorrespondence from many of the leading growers on the principles\r\nunderlying the cultivation of the vine. No physiological Philip\r\nhas come as yet to their assistance! Lindley's book had at once a\r\ngreat vogue on the Continent and was translated into most European\r\nlanguages--Russian included; but it was not till its title was changed\r\nfrom _The Theory_ ... to _The Theory and Practice ... of Horticulture_\r\nthat his incorrigible fellow-countrymen, as shy of theory as a\r\nfox-glove is of chalk, consented to buy it to any considerable extent.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless due not only to Lindley's general services to\r\nhorticulture but also to the special service which he rendered to that\r\nscience by the publication of this work that led Lord Wrottesley,\r\nPresident of the Royal Society, to say, when presenting Lindley with\r\nthe Royal Medal, that \"he had raised horticulture from the condition of\r\nan empirical art to that of a developed science.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"The Vegetable Kingdom\" and \"The Botanical Register.\"_\r\n\r\nThat John Lindley was a man of fine judgment is indicated by his\r\nown verdict that, except for _The Vegetable Kingdom_, _The Theory\r\nand Practice of Horticulture_ was his best book. That verdict is\r\nsustained by posterity, as Mr Botting Hemsley declares of the former\r\nwork,--\"This grand book must be classed as Lindley's masterpiece. No\r\nsimilar English work was in existence in 1846 when the first edition\r\nappeared, nor was there in any language so encyclopaedic a work. Even\r\nnow it is a valuable book in a small botanical library as it is a mine\r\nof information on points that are unchangeable. The work, as set forth\r\nin the preface, originated in a desire on the part of the author to\r\nmake his countrymen acquainted with the progress of Systematical Botany\r\nabroad during the previous quarter of a century.\" Both in his books and\r\nin his lectures he adopted the natural system of classification and did\r\nmuch to popularise it though, as previously stated, his contemporaries\r\nRobert Brown, the Hookers, and G. Bentham were equally powerful\r\nadherents of the new system. To quote the picturesque if somewhat\r\nimmoderate language of Reichenbach \"for a long time the youthful\r\ninterloper found no favour on account of his having introduced in\r\nconjunction Scot Brown, Gray and the still youthful Hooker the natural\r\nsystem of the hated Frenchman; where the more numerous disciples of\r\nLinnæus had thought to pass their lives in the glory of pondering and\r\nadmiring the great Swede.\" That Lindley was an early convert to this\r\ninnovation is also proved by the fact that his inaugural lecture at\r\nUniversity College startled many by its frank and thorough expression\r\nof the superficial character of the artificial system of classifying\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe third and last edition of _The Vegetable Kingdom_ consists of\r\nabout 1000 pages in small type with upwards of 500 illustrations. It\r\ncontains an historical review of the various \"Natural Systems\" which\r\nhad been prepared, beginning with John Ray's (1703) and ending with\r\nhis own, which is used in the work. In this system Lindley divided\r\nplants into seven classes:--Thallogens, Acrogens, Rhizogens, Endogens,\r\nDictyogens, Gymnogens and Exogens, and each class was subdivided into\r\nalliances or groups of Natural Orders to which he gave names of uniform\r\ntermination, as Algales, Filicales, Glumales, Malvales, etc. This\r\nclassification, though ingenious, is defective, as the author himself\r\nrecognised. Though never adopted by other writers this fact did not\r\nprevent Bentham and Hooker from citing Lindley's work frequently in\r\ntheir _Genera Plantarum_. As Mr Botting Hemsley observes, Lindley, who\r\nin all questions of classification was both cautious and modest, seems\r\nto have been an evolutionist without knowing it. Thus in the course\r\nof discussion on the permanency of species he observes that \"all the\r\ngroups into which plants are thrown are in one sense artificial, in\r\nas much as nature recognises no such groups. As the Classes, Natural\r\nOrders and Genera of botanists have no real existence in Nature,\r\nit follows that they have no fixed limits and consequently it is\r\nimpossible to define them.... An arrangement then which shall be so\r\nabsolutely correct an expression of the plan of nature as to justify\r\nits being called _the_ Natural System is a chimera.\"\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that Hooker wrote the admirable and favourable\r\nreview of the _Origin of Species_ which appeared in the _Gardeners'\r\nChronicle_, it has been inferred that Lindley himself was not very well\r\ndisposed toward the new theories; but Lord Lindley states that his\r\nfather was much impressed by the _Origin_, said it would revolutionise\r\nbotanical studies but that there were difficulties which would require\r\nelucidation before Darwin's theory could be regarded as completely\r\nsatisfactory--surely a perspicacious judgment.\r\n\r\nTo turn to the woodcuts of _The Vegetable Kingdom_ affords both\r\npleasure and relief--pleasure on account of their excellence, relief to\r\nescape from the monotonous prettiness of modern process work.\r\n\r\nThough space will not allow reference to other text-books and to\r\ninnumerable minor publications--many of which may be found in the\r\nLindley Library in the Royal Horticultural Society's headquarters\r\nat Vincent Square--a brief mention must be made of the _Botanical\r\nRegister_. This periodical was founded in 1815, and so early as 1823\r\nLindley became a contributor to it; but it was not till 1829 that his\r\nname appeared on the title-page. From that time he was sole editor till\r\n1847, when the _Botanical Register_ ceased to appear; unable doubtless\r\nto stand against the _Botanical Magazine_ which under the editorship of\r\nHooker had passed from a moribund state into one of remarkable vigour\r\nwhich now, 125 years after its foundation, it still enjoys.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Orchids._\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of Lindley's work among his favourite group of plants,\r\nthe Orchidaceae, deserves recognition by the general botanist.\r\nBotanical knowledge with respect to the group was in a very rudimentary\r\nstage when Lindley took up its study. Robert Brown and Blume were\r\nalready engaged upon the investigation of orchids, but they relied\r\nmainly on herbarium material. Lindley, on the other hand, began with\r\nliving plants and ended with living plants, though, as his herbarium\r\ntestifies, he did not neglect dried specimens. A circumstance that\r\nfavoured Lindley in these studies was the fact that William Cattley,\r\nan early patron of Lindley, was one of the most successful of the early\r\ncultivators of epiphytic orchids.\r\n\r\nThe chief of Lindley's published contributions to the knowledge\r\nof orchids, apart from scattered figures and descriptions in the\r\n_Botanical Register_, the _Gardeners' Chronicle_, Lindley and Paxton's\r\n_Flower Garden_, the _Journal of the Linnean Society_, and in other\r\nserials and periodicals, are to be found in _The Genera and Species\r\nof Orchidaceous Plants_, 1830-1840, in which are described all the\r\nspecies (1980) known of 299 genera; _Sertum Orchidaceum_ (1838); _Folia\r\nOrchidacea_, 1852-1855; and _The Vegetable Kingdom_.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that no attempt has as yet been made to catalogue the\r\nspecies described by Lindley; but with regard to genera an approximate\r\nlist of those proposed by him may be attempted, and is interesting as\r\ngiving some idea of the extent and value of Lindley's investigations in\r\nthe group.\r\n\r\nIn the third edition of _The Vegetable Kingdom_ he estimates the number\r\nof orchid genera at 469. Bentham and Hooker (_Genera Plantarum_, 1883)\r\nadmit 334, and new genera proposed since that date amount to 125.\r\nPfitzer (Engler and Prantl, _Natürlichen Pflanzen-familien_, 1889)\r\ndescribes 410.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of Lindley's genera, admitted by Bentham and\r\nHooker, in the sequence in which they appear in the _Genera Plantarum_:\r\n\r\n  Physosiphon\r\n  Brachionidium\r\n  Oberonia\r\n  Oreorchis\r\n  Sunipia\r\n  Cirrhopetalum\r\n  Megaclinium\r\n  Trias\r\n  Drymoda\r\n  Monomeria\r\n  Panisea\r\n  Acrochaene\r\n  Coelia\r\n  Eria\r\n  Phreatia\r\n  Chysis\r\n  Anthogonium\r\n  Earina\r\n  Trichosma\r\n  Coelogyne\r\n  Otochilus\r\n  Pholidota\r\n  Lanium\r\n  Diothonea\r\n  Hormidium\r\n  Hexisia\r\n  Pleuranthium\r\n  Diacrium\r\n  Ponera\r\n  Pinelia\r\n  Hartwegia\r\n  Cattleya\r\n  Laeliopsis\r\n  Tetramicra\r\n  Laelia\r\n  Schomburgkia\r\n  Sophronitis\r\n  Galeandra\r\n  Ansellia\r\n  Cremastra\r\n  Bromheadia\r\n  Govenia\r\n  Grobya\r\n  Cheiradenia\r\n  Aganisia\r\n  Acacallis\r\n  Eriopsis\r\n  Warrea\r\n  Batemannia\r\n  Bifrenaria\r\n  Xylobium\r\n  Lacaena\r\n  Lycaste\r\n  Chondrorhyncha\r\n  Acincta\r\n  Mormodes\r\n  Cycnoches\r\n  Stenia\r\n  Clowesia\r\n  Scuticaria\r\n  Camaridium\r\n  Dichaea\r\n  Trichopilia\r\n  Aspasia\r\n  Cochlioda\r\n  Dignathe\r\n  Miltonia\r\n  Solenidium\r\n  Erycina\r\n  Abola\r\n  Trizeuxis\r\n  Ada\r\n  Sutrina\r\n  Trigonidium\r\n  Quekettia\r\n  Zygostates\r\n  Phymatidium\r\n  Centropetalum\r\n  Doritis\r\n  Aëranthes\r\n  Uncifera\r\n  Acampe\r\n  Sarcanthus\r\n  Diplocentrum\r\n  Cryptopus\r\n  Oeonia\r\n  Mystacidium\r\n  Cirrhaea\r\n  Notylia\r\n  Sertifera\r\n  Tropidia\r\n  Pterichis\r\n  Prescottia\r\n  Pseudocentrum\r\n  Gomphicis\r\n  Baskervilla\r\n  Pelexia\r\n  Herpysma\r\n  Zeuxine\r\n  Haemaria\r\n  Hylophila\r\n  Drakaea\r\n  Burnettia\r\n  Chloraea\r\n  Stenoglottis\r\n  Bicornella\r\n  Hemipilia\r\n  Glossula\r\n  Pachites\r\n  Herschelia\r\n  Monadenia\r\n  Schizodium\r\n  Forficaria\r\n  Brachycorythis\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that Bentham, who elaborated the orchids for\r\nthe _Genera Plantarum_, held broader views of generic limits than the\r\nmajority of botanists, the fact that 114 or more than a third of the\r\ngenera retained are Lindleyan is a striking testimony to the accuracy\r\nand range of Lindley's work in the group. Pfitzer in the work already\r\ncited retains 127 of Lindley's genera. In no other great family\r\nprobably has one man left so large a mark as Lindley has left in the\r\nOrchidaceae. In this connection it may be added that 40 of Robert\r\nBrown's Orchid Genera and 50 of Blume's are retained by Bentham and\r\nHooker.\r\n\r\nThe number of species of orchids known in his time Lindley doubtingly\r\nestimated at 3000. Collectors since that time have increased that\r\nnumber probably to 6000. The fact that about 1100 species of orchids\r\nare known from British India, outnumbering those of any other family by\r\nabout 300, will doubtless surprise the majority of botanists.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this notice of a remarkable and versatile man\r\nsome reference must be made to his pioneer work in the field of\r\npalaeobotany--a subject that has markedly advanced in recent times\r\nat the hands of Lindley's fellow-countrymen. In co-operation with\r\nHutton there were published (1831-1837) the three volumes of Lindley\r\nand Hutton's _Fossil Flora of Great Britain_, an authoritative work,\r\nprofusely illustrated with figures of the known fossils, and by no\r\nmeans entirely superseded at the present day. The introductory chapters\r\nto the volumes bear the mark of Lindley's handiwork, and that to volume\r\nIII. contains the results of an extensive series of experiments carried\r\nout by Lindley to determine the capacity of various plants to resist\r\nthe agencies of disintegration. These results have become classic and\r\nare often referred to by subsequent writers on palaeo-botany.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the _Fossil Flora_ Lindley amassed a\r\nconsiderable collection of specimens, some of which have recently come\r\nto light in the cellars of University College. He was obliged however\r\nto abandon this branch of study as it threatened to distract his\r\nattention from other departments of botany.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Personal Characteristics._\r\n\r\nIn as much as it is our custom to erect none but the slightest and most\r\ncasual memorials to our distinguished men of science or of letters,\r\nthere is reason to rejoice that the name of Lindley is not inadequately\r\ncommemorated.\r\n\r\nThe Lindley Library purchased in his honour and now permanently\r\nattached to the Royal Horticultural Society bids fair under the\r\nenlightened policy of that flourishing institution to grow into a great\r\ncollection of horticultural works. The genus _Lindleya_ is reminiscent\r\nto systematists of their great colleague and the name of Lindley is\r\nknown and honoured by all our horticulturists. Of the man himself just\r\nso much may be said as to give form to the mind's image of him.\r\n\r\nHe was of middle height, active, upright, with shoulders somewhat\r\nsloping and of heavy tread. The sightlessness of one eye gave to his\r\nresolute face a somewhat strange look. Simple in habits, strenuous in\r\nwork and perspicacious in judgment, John Lindley was a warm hearted\r\nand generous friend, particularly to young botanists. He was a\r\npowerful foe: altogether a masterful and remarkable man. Not suffering\r\nfools gladly yet with a humorous turn of mind: \"I am a dandy in my\r\nherbarium,\" he once exclaimed to Reichenbach. Knowing no fear he\r\ncould not hope for much favour, and yet carrying his heavy load of\r\nfinancial responsibility, he nevertheless won through to a wide measure\r\nof contemporary recognition and an assured place in the history of\r\nbotanical science. To conclude with Reichenbach's fine tribute \"we\r\ncannot tell how long Botany, how long science, will be pursued; but\r\nwe may affirm that so long as a knowledge of plants is considered\r\nnecessary, so long will Lindley's name be remembered with gratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM GRIFFITH\r\n\r\n1810-1845\r\n\r\nBY W. H. LANG\r\n\r\n  Early training--medical appointment under the East\r\n  India Company--his travels--the magnitude of his\r\n  collections--his method of work--results of researches\r\n  mainly published posthumously--the ovule and\r\n  fertilisation--Santalum--Loranthaceae--Balanophora--Avicennia--his\r\n  gymnosperm work illustrated by Cycas--discovery of the\r\n  pollen-chamber--Rhizocarps and Liverworts--pre-Hofmeisterian\r\n  work--Griffith's relation to his times.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might have been assumed that all the names of British botanists\r\nwhose work has been or is to be considered in this course of lectures\r\nwould have been familiar to their successors of to-day, even if their\r\nworks were too often neglected for the last words of scientific\r\nprogress in a summary of literature. The question has however been put\r\nto me by more than one botanist in the last month or two, \"_But who\r\nwas Griffith?_\" That this should be possible seems in itself ample\r\njustification for including his name in this list of British botanists.\r\n\r\nFor Griffith has claims to be regarded as a great botanist. It is\r\ntrue that he failed to break through the limitations of his time and\r\nperiod--that he left no new and more correct general views to modify\r\nthe science. But this is true of all his contemporaries, indeed it is\r\ntrue of most botanists. To recreate the department of a science in\r\nwhich a man labours requires a combination of ability and fortunate\r\nchance that is given to few.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate XV_ WILLIAM GRIFFITH (1843)]\r\n\r\nGriffith had the ability, the power of independent observation, the\r\nreadiness to speculate, the careless prodigality of labour. He did\r\nnot however, in the fraction of an ordinary working life that fate\r\nallowed him, attain that insight into more correct comparison of the\r\nplants whose morphology he studied which would have acted quickly on\r\nthe mass of first hand observation he possessed.\r\n\r\nIt is well to be clear at the outset that it is the personality of\r\nWilliam Griffith, his important detailed contributions to botany, and\r\nhis achievement as a great working morphologist of his time that will\r\ninterest us to-day--rather than his general views or any influence\r\nof these on the progress of botany. Griffith had the advantage or\r\ndisadvantage of botany being his private study and not his profession.\r\nThe motive force of his career was however his love of scientific work\r\nfor its own sake.\r\n\r\nWilliam Griffith was a London botanist. He was the son of a London\r\nmerchant, born on March 4, 1810, at Ham Common. Having finished school\r\nhe began to prepare for the medical profession and was apprenticed to a\r\nsurgeon in the West end of London. About 1829 he commenced attendance\r\nat the classes in the newly established University College. He had\r\nearlier in life shown an interest in natural history but was now\r\nspecially devoted to botany. He attended Lindley's lectures, and also\r\nstudied medical botany under Mr Anderson at the Apothecaries' Garden in\r\nChelsea. There he obtained the Linnean Gold Medal given by the Society\r\nof Apothecaries. At this time also he was a frequent visitor to Kew\r\nGardens where he was on good terms with the head gardener and also came\r\nunder the influence of Mr Bauer the great botanical draughtsman of his\r\nday. Griffith was never tired of expressing his admiration for Bauer\r\nas an accurate observer. During his vacations Griffith made botanical\r\nexcursions in England, carrying his light baggage and his equipment for\r\ncollecting plants.\r\n\r\nThat the training that Griffith received in botany in the London\r\nUniversity of that date was a sound one is shown by his power of facing\r\nthe most various problems when cast on his own resources immediately\r\nat the close of his University training. The soundness of his training\r\nis further shown by the small pieces of original work he had published\r\nbefore leaving England at the age of 22. Not only had he made some\r\nof the illustrations for Lindley's _Introduction to Botany_ and had\r\ndescribed the flower and the structure of the wood of _Phytocrene\r\ngigantea_ in Wallich's _Plantae Asiaticae Rariores_, but (a noteworthy\r\nindication of his interest in Cryptogams at this time) he had supplied\r\nan account of the structure and development of _Targionia hypophylla_\r\nto be appended to Mirbel's classic monograph on the anatomy and\r\nphysiology of _Marchantia polymorpha_--published in 1832.\r\n\r\nHis medical studies finished, Griffith sailed from England in May 1832,\r\nhe arrived at Madras in September and was appointed Assistant-Surgeon\r\non the Madras establishment in the service of the East India Company.\r\nHis scientific work was done in the intervals of a busy life. Only a\r\nman of great energy and enthusiasm and possessed of great powers of\r\nphysical endurance could have done the work that Griffith crowded into\r\nthe 12½ years, between his landing in India and his death at Malacca\r\nbefore the age of 35 on February 9, 1845. This time was all spent in\r\nthe East Indies--he never returned to England.\r\n\r\nDeferring for the moment consideration of his scientific work we may\r\ntake a general survey of Griffith's movements during his working life\r\nand of his labours as an explorer and collector.\r\n\r\nAfter spending some months in the neighbourhood of Madras, he was\r\nsituated for more than two years at Mergui and collected extensively\r\nin Tenasserim. He was recalled to Calcutta in 1835 and attached to the\r\nBengal Presidency in order to be sent with Dr Wallich and Mr M'Clelland\r\nto visit and inspect the localities in which tea grew wild in Assam.\r\nGriffith's full report on this enquiry led to the important economic\r\nconclusion (based largely on a critical comparison of the Assam flora\r\nwith the flora of tea-growing regions of China) that tea might be\r\nsuccessfully grown under the conditions in Assam and similar districts\r\nof India. When the other members of the expedition returned Griffith\r\nwas detained in Assam, where he remained during the whole of 1836,\r\nmaking a successful expedition into the Mishmee mountains only once\r\nbefore visited by a European.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1837 Griffith, accompanied by only one servant, set off on\r\nan exploring expedition through the very disturbed country of Burmah\r\ntowards Rangoon. All news of him ceased, or rather his assassination\r\nwas credited by the Government and reported in the newspapers, when in\r\nJune he re-appeared, ragged and travel stained, in Calcutta. He had\r\nexplored down the Hookhoom (Hokong) Valley and on to Ava, and had then\r\nproceeded more rapidly by river to Rangoon, conveying his collections\r\nwith danger and difficulty.\r\n\r\nAppointed Surgeon to the embassy about to start for Bhutan, he filled\r\nup the intervening two months by again going to the Khasi hills to\r\ncollect. He then accompanied the expedition to Bhutan, traversing over\r\nfour hundred miles of the country and returning to Calcutta in June\r\n1838. Here he spent the next few months arranging his collections and\r\nalso studying the plants of the suburbs.\r\n\r\nIn November he joined the army of the Indus and accompanied it in its\r\nwhole march. He remained another year in Afghanistan making various\r\nexpeditions in the country and into the Hindoo Koosh. He returned,\r\nafter visiting Simla and the Nerbudda, to Calcutta in the middle of\r\n1841.\r\n\r\nGriffith then proceeded to Malacca where he had been appointed Civil\r\nAssistant-Surgeon. He remained only a year, but long enough to\r\nappreciate the great interest of the district for his botanical work\r\nand to complete some important observations. He collected the plants of\r\nthe province and also visited Mount Ophir.\r\n\r\nRecalled to Calcutta, he took charge of the Botanic Gardens and also\r\nlectured to the medical students during Wallich's absence from August\r\n1842 to August 1844, pressing forward reforms in the gardens and\r\nusing his opportunity for scientific observation. On Wallich's return\r\nGriffith remained for some months longer in Calcutta continuing his\r\nwork, married in September, and returned to Malacca in December full\r\nof hopeful plans for scientific work there. He had barely arrived at\r\nMalacca and begun work than he was seized with a fatal illness and died\r\non February 9, 1845.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary to consider in some detail the rapid movements\r\nof Griffith's life in the East in order to fully appreciate the\r\ndifficulties under which his large amount of scientific work was\r\naccomplished. The twelve years of his official life were filled with\r\nprofessional duties, difficult and dangerous exploration, management of\r\nthe Botanic Gardens, and the labours entailed in making and caring for\r\nextensive collections. It would not have been surprising had Griffith,\r\nin spite of his attainments, contributed nothing to scientific botany\r\nbeyond rendering these collections available for other workers. He\r\nestimated his collection of plants at more than twelve thousand\r\nspecies; and on his travels he did not neglect other collections of\r\ninterest. Insects obtained by him are described, he collected the birds\r\nand fish in every district he visited; indeed he was a keen fisherman\r\nand must have thrown a fly in many a stream that had not been fished\r\nbefore, combining sport and science.\r\n\r\nGriffith's collections were made with the definite purpose of enabling\r\nhim, when he had leisure, to produce a general account of the Indian\r\nflora on a geographical basis. His methods of collecting were most\r\nenlightened and subserved his work as a morphologist and a student\r\nof the conditions of occurrence of the plants, not merely of formal\r\nsystematic botany. The journals he kept on all expeditions are full of\r\nreferences to the occurrence of the plants met with. He often adopted\r\na plan of roughly mapping each day's route and indicating the plants\r\nand associations of plants, along the line of march. I wonder if modern\r\necologists know of these records made long before ecology was invented?\r\n\r\nWhenever possible he seems to have examined the morphology of the\r\nliving plants, and he fully realised the value of preserving portions\r\nof the plants in spirit for future examination instead of relying on\r\nherbarium material.\r\n\r\nThis quotation from a letter to Wight (then Superintending Surgeon of\r\nthe Madras Service), with whom Griffith kept up a most interesting and\r\nfriendly correspondence, from which I should like to quote largely, may\r\ngive an idea of his point of view and also show how he looked forward\r\nto returning to Malacca:--\r\n\r\n\"If ever you go to the place of Podostemon endeavour to get some\r\ngerminating or at least very young plants. I can fancy how an\r\nAcotyledonous plant gets a stem but how a Dicotyledonous plant loses\r\nit, and becomes as some of them do, mere discs spread over rocks is\r\nanother thing. Then again where are their roots? How opposed to late\r\nideas of the absolute distinction of the three great divisions. Also\r\nplease to take a bottle of spirits, and deposit specimens in it. I\r\nshall not be very sorry to get back to Malacca, this is a delightful\r\nplace truly, but one is interrupted, and the lectures at the Medical\r\nCollege consume much time. For botany no place can exceed Malacca.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again,\r\n\r\n\"What a business it will be to settle the types of the families from\r\nwhich the names must eventually be taken; this will never be done by\r\ndried-plant botanists; but by examination of development, which I am\r\nconvinced will alone give the key.\"\r\n\r\nAs to Griffith's methods of work, we learn from a memorial notice\r\nof him by Mr M'Clelland that whenever possible after the business\r\nof the morning was finished the rest of the day was devoted \"to the\r\nexamination and dissection of plants under the microscope, drawing and\r\ndescribing all peculiarities presented.\" \"Even on his death-bed his\r\nmicroscope stood beside him with the unfinished drawings and papers\r\nand dissections of plants on which he was engaged the day on which the\r\nfatal symptoms of his disorder came on.\"\r\n\r\nAll his work shows the same characters of direct individual observation\r\nand interpretation of the facts before him, repeated examination of\r\nthe same point, and almost a prodigality of labour in recording his\r\nobservations in drawings. At first under the influence of Robert\r\nBrown, he used the simple microscope with triplet lenses, but later\r\nhe employed the compound microscope and in the year before his death\r\nwrites hopefully of ordering a first-rate microscope when he obtains\r\nthe arrears due to him from the Directors.\r\n\r\nGriffith's high attainments were appreciated by the distinguished\r\ncircle of English botanists of his time with whom he corresponded. Mr\r\nSolby, to whom he always sent home his papers for submission to the\r\nLinnean Society; Robert Brown, to whose work he constantly recurs with\r\nadmiration, and whose judgment he trusted absolutely; Lindley; Sir\r\nWilliam Hooker, who looked forward to his being settled permanently in\r\ncharge of the Calcutta gardens, and Dr Wight may be named.\r\n\r\nI may quote from a letter addressed to Griffith by von Martius of\r\nMunich, since it couples his own opinion and that of Robert Brown. \"He\r\n(Brown) agrees with me in appreciating your spirited and enlightened\r\ninvestigations, and I now more than ever look forward to you as his\r\nsuccessor--as the standard English botanist.\"\r\n\r\nOnly an outline of the nature of Griffith's scientific work with some\r\ndetails on selected subjects can be attempted here. His published works\r\nin the _Transactions_ of the Linnean Society and elsewhere, important\r\nas they are, represent only a small fraction of his observations. But\r\nthe wisdom and liberality of the East India Company has put us in\r\npossession of his unpublished notes and drawings (bequeathed with his\r\ncollections to the Company) in the posthumously published volumes of\r\n_Notulae ad plantas Asiaticas_ with the accompanying sets of plates.\r\nThough his papers were not ready or intended for publication in this\r\nform and suffer from having had to be arranged by another hand,\r\nthey afford, together with his published work, a particularly good\r\npicture of how the problems of morphology and classification presented\r\nthemselves to a keen investigator at this time.\r\n\r\nOf his purely systematic work I shall not speak at length. In\r\naddition to smaller papers the most important contribution was his\r\nillustrated monograph on the Palms of British East India. In the\r\n_Notulae_ numerous species are described and figured nearly always with\r\nreference to the morphology and physiology of the parts concerned. It\r\nis his investigations made with direct reference to morphology and\r\nreproduction that claim our attention most. In dealing with them it\r\nis convenient to treat of the main questions to which he directed his\r\nattention rather than of the separate papers. I shall call attention\r\nfirst to his work on _the flower and on fertilisation_ in a number of\r\nplants, then to his _observations on Cycas_, and lastly to _his work on\r\nthe Cryptogams_.\r\n\r\nInterest in the structure of the ovule and the nature of fertilisation\r\nwas widespread at the time Griffith worked. A few years previously\r\nRobert Brown had laid the foundations of the scientific study of the\r\novule and the behaviour of the pollen tube, and during Griffith's\r\ntime the papers of Schleiden, which extended the comparative study of\r\nthe ovule and advanced the important though erroneous view that the\r\nembryo originated inside the embryo-sac from the tip of the entering\r\npollen tube, were appearing. Schleiden's text-book did not appear until\r\ntoo late to be known to Griffith. His interest was keen on continuing\r\nthe work, that Brown had begun, on plants that only a resident in the\r\ntropics had the opportunity of studying properly, and the first volume\r\nof the _Notulae_, with the accompanying Icones, and the more systematic\r\nvolume on the Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons contain his unpublished\r\nobservations on the ovule and flowers of many plants.\r\n\r\nHis first paper in the Linnean Transactions was on the ovule of\r\n_Santalum_. Griffith observed and rightly interpreted the free\r\nprolongation of the embryo-sac from the nucellus, and described the\r\napplication of the pollen tube to the summit of the embryo-sac, the\r\ndevelopment of the endosperm, and the origin and development of the\r\nembryo. He also recognised and figured the great prolongation backwards\r\nof the embryo-sac as an empty, absorbent caecum. At first he left the\r\norigin of the embryo doubtful, while recognising the advantages of the\r\nexposed embryo-sac for settling the question, but later he decided in\r\nfavour of Schleiden's erroneous view that the embryo developed from the\r\ntip of the pollen tube. Griffith also examined the ovules of _Osyris_\r\nrecognising the corresponding facts.\r\n\r\nComparison with the figures of Santalaceous ovules in Guignard's later\r\nwork will serve to show both the magnificent accuracy in observation of\r\nGriffith and the limitation, running through all the work of the time,\r\nof not recognising the contents of the embryo-sac before fertilisation.\r\n\r\nThe Loranthaceae was another family on which the development of the\r\nembryo-sac and the processes of fertilisation and development of the\r\nfruit interested Griffith specially. Not only did he send his results\r\nhome to the Linnean Society in two papers, but his descriptions and\r\nfigures of all the species described in the _Notulae_ take account of\r\nthese morphological and developmental facts. He traced the development\r\nof the cavity of the ovary and regarded the ovules as reduced to their\r\nsimplest expression--to an \"amnios\" or embryo-sac. And he observed the\r\nextension of the embryo-sacs up the style and the union of the pollen\r\ntube with the tip of the embryo-sac. His further description of the\r\ndevelopment of the embryo, endosperm and fruit is wonderfully exact if\r\nwe allow for his regarding the long suspensor bearing the embryo as\r\nderived from the pollen tube growing down through the long embryo-sac.\r\n\r\nGriffith thus recognised all the main peculiarities of _Viscum_ and of\r\n_Loranthus_ subsequently described more in detail in European species\r\nby Hofmeister (whose analysis of Griffith's work in 1859 is a great\r\ntestimony to its accuracy) and later by Treub in the tropical species\r\nwhich had been studied by Griffith.\r\n\r\nThe Balanophoraceae was another group, on which Griffith made pioneer\r\ninvestigations. He collected and examined all the species he met with,\r\npartly from the systematic interest in supporting Robert Brown's\r\nobjection to Lindley's class of Rhizantheae, but still more from his\r\ninterest in the details of their reproduction. An examination of the\r\nplates from his memoirs, only published after his death, in the Linnean\r\n_Transactions_ will show how fully he was aware of the structure of the\r\narchegonium-like female flower of _Balanophora_; of the relation of\r\nthe pollen-grains and pollen tubes to it; and of the appearance of the\r\nendosperm which he mistook for the embryo. Throughout he compares the\r\nstructure with the pistillum (archegonium) of Bryophyta.\r\n\r\nThus in the Balanophoraceae also Griffith laid the foundations on which\r\nthe work of Hofmeister, and more recently that of Treub and Lotsy\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nWhen at Malacca Griffith interested himself among many other problems\r\nin the ovule and the development of the seed of _Avicennia_. He had\r\npreviously paid attention to the viviparous embryos of other Mangroves.\r\nThis piece of work, when compared with Treub's re-examination of\r\n_Avicennia_, brings out so clearly Griffith's accuracy, so far as his\r\nmeans of observation allowed him to go, that we may look for a moment\r\nat how these two investigations, separated by forty years, compare.\r\n\r\nGriffith recognised the development of the embryo-sac in the nucellus\r\nof the ovule which he took to be naked, missing the very slightly\r\nindicated integument. He followed the pollen tube to the tip of the\r\nembryo-sac and the development of the endosperm in its upper portion,\r\nwhere the embryo appeared. He saw the growth of the endosperm leading\r\nto its complete protrusion from the ovule and inverting the embryo so\r\nthat its cotyledons point to the surface. Further he saw the long,\r\nempty, absorbent caecum grow out from the hinder end of the embryo-sac\r\ninto the massive base of the young seed.\r\n\r\nThis account is substantially correct in all its facts, and Treub's\r\nwork adds to it the cellular details of the origin of the embryo-sac,\r\nthe setting apart of the endosperm cell to grow into the haustorium,\r\nand the details of segmentation of the embryo.\r\n\r\nSuch vivid, accurate, description of strange facts, when previous\r\nknowledge gave no clue, is in itself no mean scientific achievement.\r\n\r\nTo sum up Griffith's work on the morphology of the reproductive organs\r\nof the Angiosperms we see that he added many important facts and gave\r\ncorrect descriptions of what still remain among the most anomalous\r\novules and embryos. His methods did not enable him to distinguish\r\nclearly the contents of the embryo-sac, and he accepted and confirmed\r\nSchleiden's erroneous view of the origin of the embryo. But this\r\nhardly detracts from the directness and consequent value of all his\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the Gymnosperms, we find again that Griffith devoted\r\nmuch attention to those forms that from his residence in the tropics\r\nhe was in a position to study with most advantage. He describes in the\r\n_Notulae_ his observations on the ovules and pollination of various\r\nConiferae and Gnetaceae. But we may concentrate our interest on his\r\nwork on _Cycas_. The rough structure of the young seed had already been\r\ndescribed by Robert Brown who had recognised the gymnospermy of the\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nBut Griffith's descriptions and figures are much more accurate--are\r\nindeed far in advance of those of much later observers--and add greatly\r\nto our knowledge of this plant. These two figures (pl. XVI) will\r\nspeak for themselves and show how clearly Griffith had grasped the\r\nmorphology of the Cycadean ovule, how faithfully he delineated the\r\ndetails, and how he sought in progressive development to throw light\r\non the structure. He added to the previously imperfect description of\r\nthe ovule an accurate account of the pollen chamber, and the proof\r\nthat pollen grains entered and filled it. Further he followed the\r\ngermination of the pollen grains, not merely recording the fact that\r\nthe tubes penetrated the nucellus all around the pollen chamber, but\r\nascertaining in how many days the tubes were put forth. His fullest\r\ndescription is unfortunately displaced in the _Notulae_ under the\r\nheading of _Thuja_, but it is clear that it refers to the _Cycas_\r\nfigured on the same plate as that plant.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said of the nature of Griffith's work on the ovules,\r\nboth of Angiosperms and Gymnosperms, the complete omission of his name\r\nin recent works on the two groups that are in constant use is at least\r\nnoteworthy.\r\n\r\nGriffith was specially interested in the study of Cryptogamic plants.\r\nIn a letter to Wight he says \"I would like to be out with a work\r\non Indian Cryptogamia of higher forms; so much so that if I see no\r\nchance of my succeeding to the Gardens, I intend sending away all my\r\nother collections, and devoting myself to this object and general\r\ndevelopment, which is obviously the keystone of the arch.\"\r\n\r\nHe left Algae and Fungi (with the exception of the Characeae) alone,\r\nand it is his work on the Bryophyta and Pteridophyta that concerns us.\r\nFor information on his views on these plants we are dependent on his\r\npaper on _Salvinia_ and _Azolla_ and on the _Notulae_, put together\r\nas I have said from his notes after his death, and not intended for\r\npublication in this form. But there is no difficulty in getting a\r\nclear grasp of his point of view. This was a mistaken one--an attempt\r\nto bring into line the reproduction of the gametophyte of Bryophytes,\r\nthe sporophyte of Vascular Cryptogams, and the flowering plant with\r\nits flower and fruit. It is easy to be wise after the event. In these\r\ncomparisons Griffith belonged to his time with a much wider field of\r\npersonal observation than most possessed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate XVI_ From Griffith's _Notulae_\r\n\r\nMedian section of the ovule of Cycas\r\n\r\nNucellar apex of Cycas with pollen chamber and pollen grains]\r\n\r\nWe must bear in mind that at the time when Griffith worked no idea of\r\nthe sexual and asexual alternating generations in Pteridophytes had\r\nbeen gained, although the prothallia had been observed preceding the\r\ngrowth of the plant in _Equisetum_ and Ferns. It was not till some\r\nyears after Griffith's death that fuller facts as to the sexual organs\r\nwere obtained and led to the right comparisons.\r\n\r\nGriffith's work on the Bryophyta shows the same power of observation as\r\nthat on the ovule, but the difficulties due to imperfect instruments\r\nare more evident. His views on reproduction were here, however, clear,\r\nsince the development of the capsule was definitely related to the\r\nfertilisation of the pistilla (archegonia) by the substance formed in\r\nthe anthers. His figures indicate how much he saw, and how here also he\r\nsought in development the interpretation of mature structure.\r\n\r\nHis early interest in the Liverworts, especially the Marchantiaceae,\r\ncontinued, and all the forms he collected were carefully examined and\r\nfigured with his usual accuracy.\r\n\r\nOne of the Liverworts Griffith described may be taken as an\r\nillustration to this part of our subject on account of the interest\r\nof its re-discovery and re-description in 1910 by Goebel. This is\r\na plant collected in Assam and named _Monosolenium tenerum_. This\r\nMarchantiaceous plant is described as having no air-chamber layer,\r\nas bearing sessile, dorsal, antheridial receptacles, and terminal,\r\nshortly stalked archegoniophores with one ventral groove in the stalk.\r\nA single archegonium--later capsule--is found in each of the half-dozen\r\ninvolucres. Spores and irregular bodies were found in the capsule.\r\n\r\nRecently Goebel had two tea-plants sent home from Canton. They died,\r\nbut he kept the soil moist on the chance of germinating seeds. Among a\r\nnumber of other plants there turned up a new Liverwort. On examination\r\nthis proved to be Griffith's _Monosolenium_--all types of which had\r\nbeen lost--a most interesting form related to the Corsiniaceae.\r\n\r\nIn the Mosses and the Liverworts generally Griffith was clear on the\r\ndevelopment of the capsule or fruit following on the impregnation of an\r\narchegonium. But in _Anthoceros_, while he recognised the antheridia he\r\nwas not clear as to the sunken archegonia, and regarded the capsules\r\nas arising by impregnation of unrecognisable spots on the young frond\r\nor thallus. He observed however the indication of the canal of the\r\narchegonial neck above the young capsule.\r\n\r\nAnalogy with _Anthoceros_ confirmed him in his views on the\r\nreproduction of ferns. Here he spent much labour in considering the\r\nview, originally due to Hedwig, that the ramenta were male organs by\r\nthe effect of which the sporangia developed. Griffith saw that if this\r\nwas so, since the sporangia are initiated very early, the only time to\r\nsearch for the male organs was in the very young stage of the leaf. On\r\nexamining such young leaves he found the terminal cells of the young\r\nramenta very prominent and formed the working hypothesis that they were\r\nthe male organs. But he stated this cautiously and was well aware how\r\nimperfect his means of observation were.\r\n\r\nThe whole line of work brings vividly before us how cryptogamic the\r\nCryptogams were at this period.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to survey Griffith's views on the various groups\r\nof Vascular Cryptogams, a word must be said of those on _Salvinia_\r\nand _Azolla_, on which he published a long paper in addition to the\r\nother descriptions and figures in the _Notulae_. His observations bear\r\non the development of the sorus and sporangium, but he dismissed the\r\nmicrosporangia as abortive or imperfectly developed structures. (I may\r\nnote in passing that the study of their development led him to regard\r\nthe microsporangia of _Isoetes_ in the same way.) He dwelt on the\r\nsimilarity of the sporangium and indusium of _Azolla_ to a gymnospermus\r\novule, and regarded the filaments of _Anabena_ seen penetrating within\r\nthe indusium as probably the fertilising bodies in this naked-seeded\r\ncryptogam.\r\n\r\nThus with a large amount of fresh and original observation Griffith\r\nwas on wrong lines in his general views and comparison--he classed the\r\nhigher Cryptogams in his _Notulae_ as\r\n\r\n  Pistilligerous.  Musci.   Hepaticae.\r\n  Gymnospermous.   Azolla.  Salvinia.   Chara.\r\n  Cryptogamous.    Ferns.   Lycopods.   Isoetes.  Marsilidae.\r\n                     Anthocerotidae.  Equisetidae.\r\n\r\nGriffith's general views of the reproduction of all the Vascular\r\nCryptogams was necessarily wrong, since the prime clue of the\r\nrecognition of the prothallus and plant as distinct had not been\r\nfound. In this connection his figuring young plants of _Equisetum_\r\nattached to prothalli is interesting. In some speculations concerning\r\nthe embryology of _Loranthus_ he came, by a wrong line of approach,\r\nwithin touch of the right comparison, when he compares the endosperm to\r\nthe confervoid green growth (i.e. the prothallus) at the base of the\r\nyoung plant of _Equisetum_.\r\n\r\nIt is idle to speculate on what might have happened had such a wide\r\nobserver as Griffith chanced on the clue. In this respect he was of his\r\ntime as most are. The man who put the industrious but blind gropings\r\nof this period in morphological botany straight, both as regards the\r\ndevelopment of the embryo and the comparative ontogeny of archegoniate\r\nplants was Hofmeister, and like all exceptional men he belonged to the\r\nnew period created by him.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of this course of lectures seems to me to be that\r\nit approaches the study of the history of botany in the right way; for\r\nprogress in our science has been the result of individuals rather than\r\nof schools. The consideration of the work of Griffith from 1832 to 1845\r\nis a vivid illustration of the condition of morphological botany in\r\nthe earlier portion of the period, surveyed in one of the chapters in\r\nSach's _History_ under the title of \"Morphology and Systematic Botany\r\nunder the influence of the History of Development and the knowledge of\r\nthe Cryptogams.\" These two subjects were always before Griffith.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the personality of William Griffith and of the work\r\nhe accomplished in his tragically short life is obvious. Not less so\r\nis the way in which that work was done inside the limitations of his\r\nperiod. We, who are still gleaners in the field that Griffith and\r\nhis contemporaries cleared and Hofmeister marked out and tilled, are\r\nprobably just as incapable of conceiving the future developments of\r\nmorphology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHUR HENFREY\r\n\r\n1819-1859\r\n\r\nBY F. W. OLIVER\r\n\r\n  Narrative--state of Botany--dawn of the Golden Age--sexuality of\r\n  Angiosperms--Schleiden's elucidation of fern life-history--Nägeli,\r\n  Suminski and Hofmeister--recognition by Henfrey--original\r\n  work--publications--the _Micrographic Dictionary_--_The Botanical\r\n  Gazette_--its features--Henfrey's labours not immediately\r\n  productive.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe claim of Henfrey to rank among the founders of botany in this\r\ncountry depends less on his own original contributions than on a\r\nwhole-hearted devotion to the propagation and diffusion of the newer\r\nmethods and results which marked an epoch during the forties and\r\nfifties of last century. The outset of Henfrey's career coincided with\r\na great turning point in the history of botany, and to Henfrey will\r\nalways belong the credit of being the first Englishman to recognise\r\nthe full significance of the movement. From that moment he unceasingly\r\nmade known and diffused in this country the results of the German\r\nrenaissance. That Henfrey should have failed to establish the newer\r\nbotany in England was the result of a variety of circumstances, one of\r\nwhich was his early death.\r\n\r\nThe available biographical material of Henfrey being extremely meagre,\r\nit has been necessary in preparing the present account to rely almost\r\nentirely on his published writings. In some ways this lack of personal\r\ndetails is no disadvantage as our present interest in Henfrey depends\r\nessentially on the movement in botany with which he was identified.\r\n\r\nArthur Henfrey was born at Aberdeen, in 1819, of English parents. He\r\nunderwent the usual course of training for the medical profession at\r\nSt Bartholomew's Hospital--becoming a member of the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons in 1843. In consequence of bronchial trouble, to which he\r\neventually succumbed at the early age of 39, Henfrey never practised\r\nhis profession. Compelled to a life of seclusion he at once turned\r\nto a scientific career and more particularly to the pursuit of\r\nbotany. In 1847 he undertook the duties of Lecturer in Botany at St\r\nGeorge's Hospital Medical School, where among his colleagues was Edwin\r\nLankester, himself a redoubtable naturalist and the father of Sir Ray\r\nLankester, the eminent zoologist of our own day.\r\n\r\nHenfrey succeeded Edward Forbes as Professor of Botany in King's\r\nCollege, London, in 1852--a post which he held till his death. He was\r\nelected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society in the same year.\r\n\r\nHe died quite suddenly in 1859, at the house on Turnham Green, where he\r\nhad resided for many years.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the part played by Henfrey, it is necessary\r\nbriefly to review the state of botany in the first half of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus of course, botanically, the outstanding fact of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, was no exception to the dictum that \"the evil that men do\r\nlives after them.\"\r\n\r\nIt was supposed that botany had reached its culminating\r\npoint in Linnaeus and that improvement could only be made in\r\ndetails--elaborating and extending his system. As Sachs tells us in his\r\n_History_, the result was that \"Botany ceased to be a science; even\r\nthe describing of plants which Linnaeus had raised to an art became\r\nonce more loose and negligent in the hands of his successors. Botany\r\ngradually degenerated under the influence of his authority into an\r\ninsipid dilettantism--a dull occupation for plant collectors who called\r\nthemselves systematists, in entire contravention of the meaning of the\r\nword.\"\r\n\r\nThis was written with especial reference to Germany, but it applied\r\nwith no less force to our own country where the Linnaean idea had taken\r\ndeep root and the Linnaean collections had found a sanctuary.\r\n\r\nHowever, by 1840, a change was coming over the face of botany.\r\nLittle as it can have been dreamt, the Golden Age was already\r\nbeginning--destined in a relatively short time to transform the\r\nsubject. This Golden Age was contemporaneous with, and immediately\r\ndependent on, the rise of a group of young botanists in the Fatherland,\r\na group which included von Mohl, Schleiden, Hofmeister, Nägeli, Cohn\r\nand De Bary. Later it was reinforced by Sachs, who in addition to being\r\na brilliant physiologist was a gifted writer who did much to establish\r\nscientific botany on a sound footing. It is impossible to overestimate\r\nthe debt due to Sachs, particularly for his great _Textbook of Botany_,\r\nwhich at the right psychological moment brought the whole of the modern\r\nwork between the covers of a single volume.\r\n\r\nIt was with the dawn of this period that Henfrey identified himself.\r\nIn the 15 years of his active career (1844-1859) he devoted himself\r\nvery largely to making his fellow-countrymen acquainted with the newer\r\naspects of botany. More particularly it was the recent discoveries as\r\nto the reproduction and life history of the Vascular Cryptogams that\r\nspecially engaged his interest--the researches which broadly speaking\r\nwe associate with Hofmeister to-day.\r\n\r\nBefore we go on to speak of the sexuality of the Cryptogams however, a\r\nfew words may be devoted to that of the flowering plants.\r\n\r\n_Sexuality of Flowering Plants._ At the period when Henfrey entered\r\non his career as a botanist no reasonable doubt remained as to the\r\nexistence of sexes among the flowering plants. The theory of the\r\nsexual significance of the organs of the flower, brilliantly founded\r\nby Koelreuter in the previous century, had been perfected with a great\r\nvolume of experimental proof by K. F. Gaertner the son of Joseph\r\nGaertner of _Carpologia_ fame.\r\n\r\nBy 1830 the mechanism of fertilisation came to light in Amici's\r\ndiscovery of the pollen tube which he traced from the stigma to the\r\nmicropyle. The microscopic aspect of the problem was taken up with\r\ngreat energy by Schleiden and brought to the forefront as the burning\r\nquestion of the early forties. The theory of Schleiden, which applied\r\nin particular to the flowering plants, made its influence felt to such\r\nan extent in the search for evidence of sexuality among the Cryptogams,\r\nthat we may conveniently state in a few words in what it consisted.\r\n\r\nSchleiden traced the pollen tube into the micropyle, and thence to the\r\nnucellus where it depressed or invaginated the apex of the embryo-sac,\r\nand in the recess or indentation so produced the tip of the pollen tube\r\nwas converted into the embryo--its actual apex being represented by the\r\nplumule. This theory was the lineal descendant in modernised trappings\r\nof the old view expressed by Morland and others at the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century that the embryo was contained in the pollen\r\ngrain, and that the ovule was no more than the brood chamber whither\r\nit must be brought to undergo further development. This erroneous\r\ninterpretation of the true facts was always repudiated by Amici,\r\nand was finally overthrown by Hofmeister and Radlkofer in the early\r\nfifties. In this connection we may note in passing Henfrey's careful\r\npaper on the impregnation of _Orchis Morio_, published in 1856, which\r\nfully corroborated Amici. In this paper the relations of pollen tube,\r\nembryo-sac, egg-cell, suspensor and embryo were correctly interpreted,\r\nand the new point established, contrary to the assertions of previous\r\nobservers, that the ovum or \"germinal-vesicle,\" prior to fertilisation,\r\nwas a naked, unwalled cell.\r\n\r\n_Sexuality in Cryptogams._ By far the most important question that came\r\nto a head in Henfrey's time was that of the morphological relationships\r\nof the Cryptogams and flowering plants. Hitherto these had remained\r\naltogether obscure in the absence of reliable data based on the proper\r\napplication of the microscope to the elucidation of the life histories\r\nof the lower plants. Under the influence of the Linnaean school, which\r\nhad taken deep root in this country, as elsewhere, the systematic study\r\nof flowering plants had been widely pursued, and in so far as the ferns\r\nwere concerned their homologies were commonly interpreted in terms\r\nof the flowering plants. Without any real guidance in fact, a great\r\ndiversity of views of these homologies found expression. The following,\r\ntaken from Lindley, may serve to illustrate their general nature.\r\n\r\nThe sorus was regarded as a sort of compound fruit, the sporangium\r\nas a carpel, the annulus as its midrib, and the spores as the seeds.\r\nSpeculations such as these are of the same order as the crude\r\nconjectures which with less excuse relieve the answer books of\r\nexamination candidates at the present time.\r\n\r\nIn the search for the male organs of the fern attention was naturally\r\ndirected to the neighbourhood of the sorus, and the stomata, indusia\r\nand glandular appendages were in turn mistaken by various observers\r\nfor the anthers. The \"limit\" was reached by Griffith who, as is stated\r\nat page 190, conjectured that the Anabena filaments which accompany\r\nthe megasporangia of Azolla were no other than the male organs of that\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nSchleiden spoke of these researches with the utmost scorn. \"For my part\r\nI am surprised that no one has yet insisted upon the presence of the\r\norgans of sense, as eyes and ears in plants, since they are possessed\r\nby animals. Such an assumption would not be a bit more absurd than\r\nthe mania of insisting upon having anthers in the Cryptogams, simply\r\nbecause they are found in the Phanerogams.\"\r\n\r\nAll these ill-grounded hypotheses were swept away in 1844 when Nägeli\r\ndiscovered antheridia containing spermatozoids on the \"cotyledon\" or\r\npro-embryo of the fern--the prothallus we call it now. Nägeli at once\r\nrecognised their essential agreement with the antheridia already known\r\nin the Bryophytes and compared the spermatozoids with the corresponding\r\nstructures in animals. But as he overlooked the existence of the\r\narchegonia, or rather by some lapse mistook them for stages in the\r\ndevelopment of the antheridia, it is not surprising that he was at\r\na loss to understand the significance of his discovery, and that he\r\nshould have commented on his dilemma in the following terms. \"Seeing\r\nthat the female organs (spores) arise on the frond at a much later\r\nstage of development, and long after the pro-embryo has died away, the\r\nfunction of the spermatozoids is far from evident.\"\r\n\r\nIt was only three years later that light was thrown on the situation,\r\nand from an unexpected quarter. Count Suminski, an amateur\r\nmicroscopist, announced the discovery of additional reproductive organs\r\non the fern pro-embryo, which he clearly distinguished from the \"spiral\r\nfilament organs\" or antheridia. His full paper, which appeared in 1848,\r\nmarks an epoch in morphology, and was a very remarkable performance.\r\nIn it he redescribes the antheridia and spermatozoids--detecting their\r\ntufted cilia which Nägeli had overlooked. The archegonia he describes\r\nas ovules without envelopes consisting of a papilla (the neck) which\r\nbecomes perforated, giving the spermatozoid access to the embryo-sac\r\nwithin. His figures of the process of fertilisation are extremely\r\ninteresting as they show how completely he was dominated by the\r\ntheory of Schleiden to which allusion has already been made. The head\r\nof the sperm is represented as entering the \"embryo-sac,\" and there\r\nbecoming encysted to form the embryo just as the tip of the pollen\r\ntube was supposed to do in flowering plants. The further development\r\nof the embryo and its various organs are traced and figured, however,\r\nin the most admirable way. At the conclusion of his paper Suminski\r\nstates that in view of the presence of male organs and ovules, and the\r\noccurrence of fertilisation, the cryptogamy of ferns does not exist in\r\na physiological sense, and ceases to have any validity as a peculiar\r\ncharacter. A remark which he follows up by the statement that ferns\r\nmust on the existing classification be referred to the Monocotyledons.\r\n\r\nIn certain respects no doubt Suminski's paper is fantastic--more\r\nespecially the circumstantial details given of the process of\r\nfertilisation. But, however we may criticise his work the credit\r\nbelongs to Suminski of showing (1) that sexual organs are borne on the\r\nprothallus, (2) that the embryo fern plant is produced as the result of\r\nfertilisation. Unlike Nägeli, to Suminski came the happy inspiration\r\nof looking for the female organs in the position where common sense\r\nindicated they ought to be found.\r\n\r\nSuminski's paper instantly aroused universal interest, and the whole\r\nof his assertions were at first categorically denied by the German\r\nbotanist Wigand.\r\n\r\nWe may now trace Henfrey's attitude to Suminski's work.\r\n\r\nHis first notice occurs in the body of a review of Lindley's\r\n\"Introduction\" in the first volume of his _Botanical Gazette_, and\r\nshows him to have been profoundly sceptical, if not contemptuous, of\r\nthe occurrence of fertilisation in the prothallus of the fern. His\r\nwords are \"this (i.e. Suminski's discovery) appears to have little but\r\noriginality to render it worthy of notice.\" That appeared in February\r\n1849.\r\n\r\nWriting at greater length of Suminski's work in the _Annals and\r\nMagazine of Natural History_, in November of the same year, he speaks\r\nmuch more guardedly. \"These researches are in the highest degree\r\ncurious, and if the facts related prove to be correct, most importantly\r\naffect the received views of analogies in the generative processes of\r\nplants.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time Henfrey says he hopes to speak more definitely on this\r\nmatter when his own investigations are complete. Two years later his\r\nown very careful work in the same field was laid before the Linnean\r\nSociety, in which he corroborated the main facts that had come to\r\nlight. Turning once again to the paper of Suminski, after making\r\ncertain criticisms of detail, Henfrey handsomely remarks--\"Nothing\r\nhowever can take from him the credit of having discovered the\r\n_archegonia_ and their import, one of the most important discoveries\r\nin physiological Botany of modern times since it has led to results\r\nrevolutionising the whole theory of the reproduction of plants and\r\nopened out a totally new sphere of inquiry into the laws and relations\r\nof vegetable life.\"\r\n\r\nFor some little time after these discoveries the archegonia of the\r\nfern were, on the initiative of Mercklin, commonly referred to as the\r\n\"organs of Suminski,\" a custom which happily fell into desuetude.\r\nMercklin, in his paper, which essentially repeats the work of Suminski,\r\nstates that he devoted his entire attention for three months to the\r\nfern prothalli before he succeeded in observing the entrance of a\r\nspermatozoid.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the early papers of the Hofmeisterian epoch--papers which\r\nform the bed-rock of the existing morphology--one is struck with the\r\nmarvellous rapidity with which their significance was apprehended. We\r\nfind the phrase \"alternation of generations\" employed within two years\r\nof the discoveries of Suminski, whilst by the early fifties the general\r\ngenetic relations of the vascular series were realized in quite a new\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nAs Sachs puts it:--\"When Darwin's theory was given to the world eight\r\nyears after Hofmeister's investigations, the relations of affinity\r\nbetween the great divisions of the vegetable kingdom were so well\r\nestablished and so patent that the theory of descent had only to accept\r\nwhat genetic morphology had actually brought to view.\"\r\n\r\nAmong Henfrey's original contributions other than those dealing\r\nwith the burning questions already mentioned, was a series dealing\r\nwith the Anatomy of Monocotyledons. This would appear to have led\r\nhim on to study the Nymphaeaceae, and especially the anatomy of\r\n_Victoria regia_--a paper which may be compared perhaps with Prof.\r\nGwynne-Vaughan's more recent study. Henfrey was quite alive to the\r\nmonocotyledonous affinity, and the enlightened and, for that date,\r\nunconventional views to which he gave expression, drew an interesting\r\nnotice by Hooker and Thomson in the first volume of their _Indian\r\nFlora_.\r\n\r\nAnother of his papers dealt rather fully with the development of the\r\nspores and elaters of Marchantia, where he filled in a considerable\r\nlacuna in the knowledge of that group. It is curious to find as late\r\nas 1855 so intelligent and well informed a botanist as Henfrey laying\r\nit down that the cells of Marchantia, in particular, and Liverworts in\r\ngeneral, were destitute of nuclei. It is superfluous to say that this\r\napprehension was quite baseless. Indeed, forty years later, the group\r\nof the Liverworts was deliberately chosen by Prof. J. B. Farmer, for\r\nthe investigation of nuclear phenomena on account of the favourable\r\nconditions under which they could be studied!\r\n\r\nMicrotechnique at that time was of course a much simpler affair than\r\nit has since become. Contemporary papers as a rule say little about\r\nmethods; however one of Henfrey's occasional notes in a magazine\r\ntells us that caustic potash, iodine, sulphuric, hydrochloric and\r\nacetic acids, together with ether were in common use. Schultze's\r\nreagent--chloride of zinc iodide--was invented in 1850, but does not\r\nappear to have been generally employed till many years later.\r\n\r\nIt would however be a serious error to underestimate the value of\r\nthe earlier work in plant histology. The present writer once spent\r\nan interesting morning in Pfeffer's laboratory at Tübingen rummaging\r\nthrough hundreds of the great von Mohl's anatomical preparations. Among\r\nthese were sections of palm endosperms in which the, at that time\r\nrecently discovered, continuity of the protoplasm through the cell\r\nwalls was plainly visible. The existence of these filaments had been\r\ndetected by von Mohl some years before, but he had refrained from\r\npublishing his observations from over-cautiousness.\r\n\r\nAs a translator and editor Henfrey was responsible for the English\r\nedition of von Mohl's _Principles of the Anatomy and Physiology of\r\nthe Vegetable Cell_, published in 1852, for two volumes of Reports on\r\nBotany in the Ray Society's publications, whilst he had a considerable\r\nshare in Lankester's translation of Schleiden's famous _Principles of\r\nScientific Botany_, 1847. In addition to these there were constant\r\nabstracts and critical reviews from his pen in the _Annals and Magazine\r\nof Natural History_--a journal of which he became botanical editor\r\nbefore the close of his life.\r\n\r\nAs a writer of text-books Henfrey was very prolific. First came his\r\n_Outlines of Botany_, 1847, followed by the _Rudiments of Botany_.\r\nMuch more ambitious was his _Elementary Course of Botany_ which became\r\na standard text-book running through numerous editions after his\r\ndeath, under the editorship of the late Dr M. T. Masters. To these\r\nmust be added, in conjunction with Griffith[106], the _Micrographic\r\nDictionary_, a substantial volume dealing in innumerable special and\r\ngeneral articles with the microscopic study of plants and animals.\r\nThis work was no mere compilation, but embodied in its pages is a very\r\nlarge amount of independent observation. The illustrations covering\r\nnearly fifty plates were by Tuffen West, and reached a high degree\r\nof excellence. A well known botanist, a contributor to the present\r\nvolume, has more than once assured me that it was to the _Micrographic\r\nDictionary_ that he owed his salvation!\r\n\r\nShould anyone desire to get a vivid and accurate picture of the\r\nprecise state of Botany in this country at the middle of the last\r\ncentury, he cannot do better than turn over the pages of _The Botanical\r\nGazette_, a monthly journal of the progress of British botany, founded\r\nand conducted by Henfrey. It was about the size of our own _New\r\nPhytologist_, with which it had not a little in common. In one respect\r\nit differed; unlike the _New Phytologist_ the _Gazette_ was financially\r\na failure and after carrying it on at his own expense for three years\r\n(1849-1851) Henfrey had to relinquish the undertaking. A perusal of\r\nits contents clearly shows that its editor regarded his journal as one\r\nof the instruments of diffusing the New Botany. Having to rely largely\r\nfor his subscribers upon the amateur collector he points out in the\r\nprefatory note that a feature will be made not only of home botany but\r\nalso of contributions or abstracts from abroad dealing with floras\r\nwhich have much in common with our own. For the benefit of those whose\r\ncollections had reached considerable dimensions, and for whom the lack\r\nof new plants might connote a waning stimulus, he held out the further\r\ninducement of papers on the general anatomy of familiar plants, of\r\nwhich an excellent example by Thilo Irmisch on the stolons of Epilobium\r\nwas included in the first number.\r\n\r\nFor the three years of its existence Henfrey kept faith with the\r\nBritish botanists and a number of _The Botanical Gazette_ rarely\r\nappeared without an article contrived for their edification. The task\r\nwas evidently a congenial one, for Henfrey had a sound knowledge of\r\nBritish plants with especial reference to geographical distribution\r\nand critical forms. Unlike several later exponents of the New Botany,\r\nHenfrey was quite able to hold his own with the systematists. He\r\nmore than once expresses the opinion that there was too great a\r\ntendency to lump species in the handbooks to the Flora, and he urged\r\non the occasion of the preparation of the third edition of the\r\n_London Catalogue of British Plants_ that many more forms should find\r\nrecognition. The editors of the catalogue however successfully opposed\r\nthe suggestion on the ingenious grounds that it would raise the weight\r\nfor postage beyond the limits of a blue (twopenny) stamp!\r\n\r\nHenfrey thought much might be done by cultivation under varying\r\nconditions to settle vexed questions as to critical species, and\r\nsuggested that a limited number of botanists in different parts of the\r\ncountry should co-operate in a scheme under which seed should annually\r\nbe distributed, harvested and re-distributed among those taking part.\r\nHenfrey himself offered to undertake the somewhat onerous duty of\r\nreceiving and distributing the seed and of generally correlating\r\nthe work. As however his proposal was merely tagged on to a note on\r\n_Sagina apetala_ and _ciliata_ it is hardly remarkable that nothing\r\ncame of it.\r\n\r\nAn interesting minor feature of the _Gazette_ was the reporting of the\r\nproceedings of the various Botanical Societies throughout the country.\r\nThese show that a chronic state of intellectual famine frequently\r\nobtained even at the leading societies--a state of which vestiges are\r\nstill occasionally discernible. It was no unusual occurrence at the\r\nLinnean even during the period of Robert Brown's presidency for the\r\nmeeting to be regaled with long extracts from the commentaries on the\r\n_Hortus Malabaricus_. In this respect however the record was easily\r\nheld by the now defunct Botanical Society of London, which eked out its\r\nprogramme for a whole year with a communication by a Mr D. Stock \"On\r\nthe Botany of Bungay, Suffolk.\" Begun on the 11th October, 1850, it\r\nonly drew to a conclusion on the 3rd October, 1851. There were other\r\nattractive features in _The Botanical Gazette_ on which space does not\r\nallow me to dwell.\r\n\r\nThe general impression gained, however, from a perusal of the papers\r\nof that time is that they were refreshingly short, as compared with\r\nour own day, and often very much to the point. The recording of\r\nobservations was rarely made the occasion for a survey of the whole\r\nfield of botany, and little trace was discernible of the present habit\r\nof over-elaboration.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing outline of Henfrey's activities shows that they were\r\ndevoted wholly to the spread of the Newer Botany in this country. The\r\nmeans employed included the publication of reviews and abstracts,\r\nthe editing of translations of the more notable books, the founding\r\nof journals, and the writing of text-books. Moreover by his own\r\ninvestigations he kept close touch with the modern work and was indeed\r\nthe means of corroborating and often materially advancing many of the\r\nlarger problems before putting them into general circulation in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in spite of this complete devotion of his life to the cause,\r\nthe New Botany found no permanent place in this country till twenty\r\nyears after Henfrey's death.\r\n\r\nBotanically speaking, the organisation and rise of taxonomy was the\r\nruling pre-occupation of the period under consideration, a direct\r\noutcome of colonial expansion and consolidation. Fed on unlimited\r\nsupplies of new material from the ends of the earth the taxonomic habit\r\nbecame supreme. What could an isolated student and recluse like Henfrey\r\ndo to stem this flood? Circumstances were too strong for him, and\r\nfounding no immediate school it remained for a later generation to take\r\nup the task.\r\n\r\nThough the history of the establishment of the New Botany in England\r\nlies outside the province of this lecture, it is instructive, as\r\na contrast in methods, to note the manner of its accomplishment.\r\nHenfrey, who relied on his pen, had proved ineffective to bring about a\r\nrevolution. Twenty years later it fell to Sir William Thiselton-Dyer,\r\nthen a young man, to succeed where Henfrey had failed. By his\r\nenlightened teaching and personal magnetism, Thiselton-Dyer aroused\r\na widespread interest in laboratory botany. But the matter was not\r\nallowed to rest there. Holding as he did an important post at Kew,\r\nthe strategic centre, he was able to obtain appointments in the chief\r\nColleges and Universities of the country for the recruits whom he\r\nhad attracted. In this way, by the exercise of an acute intelligence\r\namounting to statesmanship, and in a very short period of time, the New\r\nBotany became everywhere firmly established.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[106] Not the William Griffith of the last chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HENRY HARVEY\r\n\r\n1811-1866\r\n\r\nBY R. LLOYD PRAEGER\r\n\r\n  Early influences--Natural History--his \"pretensions\" to\r\n  science--choice of a profession--visit to London--early\r\n  publication--South Africa--investigation of its flora--appointed\r\n  Keeper of University Herbarium, Dublin--Algology with\r\n  Mrs Griffiths--_Phycologia Britannica_--appointed to\r\n  Professorship--visit to America--lectures and travels--_Nereis\r\n  Boreali-Americana_--travels in the East--Australia--New\r\n  Zealand--Fiji--return home--election to chair at Trinity College,\r\n  Dublin--_Phycologia Australica_--marriage and death--Harvey's\r\n  limitations--his reception of Darwinism--personal characteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many illustrious names that figure on the syllabus of the\r\npresent course of lectures, that of Harvey is probably one of the less\r\ngenerally known. This is due for the most part to the fact that the\r\nsubject to which the greater portion of his energies was devoted--the\r\nsystematic study of seaweeds--occupies a somewhat remote niche in the\r\nedifice of botany. Also many years of his life were spent in collecting\r\nin distant regions; and his retiring disposition, and comparatively\r\nearly death, contributed to the same result. In the scientific world of\r\nhis day he avoided publicity, but laboured with indomitable zeal at his\r\nchosen subject, leaving behind him a series of splendidly illustrated\r\ndescriptive works. For a glimpse of the man himself--his life, his\r\naims, his thoughts--we have to rely almost entirely on a volume[107]\r\nconsisting mainly of letters written to relations and to family\r\nfriends, which was edited by his cousin, Mrs Lydia Fisher, and\r\npublished a few years after his death. My indebtedness to this volume\r\nin what follows will be apparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate XVII_ WILLIAM HENRY HARVEY]\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Harvey came of the old Quaker stock that has given to\r\nIreland several of her most enthusiastic naturalists. To this group\r\nbelong Thomas Wright of Cork, Joseph Wright of Belfast, Greenwood Pim\r\nof Dublin; all of whom, immersed in affairs of business, devoted their\r\nleisure hours to science, and progressed far in the branches of zoology\r\nor botany to which they addressed themselves. Harvey's family belonged\r\nto Youghal, on the coast of Co. Cork. His father was a well-known\r\nmerchant of Limerick, in which town he himself was born, the youngest\r\nof eleven children, just a hundred years ago--in February 1811. Even\r\nas a child, his love of natural history made itself apparent, and\r\nfortunately his schooling tended to foster this taste. After a few\r\nyears at Newtown near Waterford, he went to the historic school of\r\nBallitore, in the county of Kildare. These Irish Quaker schools have\r\nlong favoured the teaching of science, and Ballitore at that time was\r\nno exception. The head master was James White, a keen naturalist, and\r\nhimself a writer on Irish botany[108]; and probably the encouragement\r\nthat young Harvey received at Ballitore had much to do with the\r\nshaping of his life. At the age of fifteen, we find him writing of his\r\ncollection of butterflies and shells, and already referring to the\r\ngroup in which he subsequently achieved his greatest fame:--\r\n\r\n\"I also intend to study my favourite and _useless_ class,\r\n_Cryptogamia_. I think I hear thee say, Tut-tut! But no matter. To be\r\nuseless, various, and abstruse, is a sufficient recommendation of a\r\nscience to make it pleasing to me. I don't know how I shall ever find\r\nout the different genera of mosses. Lichens I think will be easy\" (he\r\nlittle knew them!) \"but fungi I shall not attempt; not at all from\r\ntheir _difficulty_, but only because they are not easily preserved. But\r\ndo not say that the study of _Cryptogamia_ is useless. Remember that it\r\nwas from the genus Fucus that iodine was discovered.\"\r\n\r\nAnother letter of this period, written when he was sixteen, contains\r\nso quaint a description of himself that I am tempted to quote from it:--\r\n\r\n\"In person I am tall, and in a good degree awkward. I am silent,\r\nand when I do speak say little, particularly to people of whom I am\r\nafraid, or with whom I am not intimate. I care not for city sports,\r\nor for the diversions of the country. I am equally unknown to any\r\nhealthful amusement of boys. I cannot swim nor skate. I know nothing\r\nof the delight of these, and yet I can amuse myself and be quite\r\nhappy, seemingly without any one to share my happiness. My botanical\r\nknowledge extends to about thirty of the commonest plants. I am very\r\nfond of botany, but I have not much opportunity of learning anything,\r\nbecause I have only to show the plant to James White, who tells me\r\nall about it, which I forget the next minute. My mineralogy embraces\r\nabout twelve minerals, of which I know only the names. I am totally\r\nunacquainted with foreign shells, and know only about two hundred and\r\nfifty native ones. As to ornithology, I have stuffed about thirteen\r\nbirds. In chemistry I read a few books, and tried some experiments.\r\nIn lithography I broke a stone and a printing press. These are my\r\npretensions to science.\"\r\n\r\nThe reference to lithography is interesting, in view of the fact that\r\nhe became later on one of the most exquisite delineators of plants, and\r\nwith his own hand drew on stone the greater part of the splendid plates\r\nwhich enrich his works on Phanerogams and Algae. In his confession of\r\nignorance of sports and pastimes, we already see the result of the want\r\nof robust health which followed him through life, and brought about his\r\npremature death; and in spite of which he performed such monumental\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAlready Harvey's mind was quite made up as to what line in life he\r\nwould prefer. He cannot hope, he says, to achieve success in commerce,\r\nby \"buying cheap and selling dear.\" As regards professions, he is\r\n\"neither fit to be a doctor nor a lawyer, lacking courage for the one,\r\nand face for the other, and application for both.... All I have a taste\r\nfor is natural history, and that might possibly lead in days to come\r\nto a genus called _Harveya_, and the letters F.L.S. after my name, and\r\nwith that I shall be content.... The utmost extent of my ambition\r\nwould be to get a professorship of natural history.\"\r\n\r\nHis parents had thought of placing the boy with an eminent chemist in\r\nLondon, but his obvious antipathy to the prospect of city life led to\r\nhis entering his father's office in Limerick instead. The quiet home\r\nlife which ensued was well suited to his taste. All holidays were\r\ndevoted to collecting. The family had a summer residence at Miltown\r\nMalbay, on the Atlantic coast, an excellent spot for Algae; and it was\r\nno doubt the time spent there that brought these plants prominently\r\nunder his notice, and led to the noteworthy researches of later days.\r\nFor the time, Mollusca still mainly occupied his mind, and in 1829, at\r\neighteen years of age, we find him busily engaged in drawing the plates\r\nfor a _Testacea Hibernica_--a book that never saw the light, though two\r\nyears later he writes of being at work on his _Bivalvia Hibernica_,\r\nwhich was then half finished.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, he made his first excursion into \"foreign parts\"\r\nas he calls them, visiting Dublin, Liverpool, London, Edinburgh and\r\nGlasgow. An account of a meeting of the Linnean Society, to which he\r\nwas taken by his friend Bicheno, then secretary, and at which \"if not\r\nedified I was amused,\" shows that the reverence he felt for science\r\ndid not necessarily extend to constituted scientific authority. \"The\r\nPresident wore a three-cocked hat of ample dimensions, and sat in\r\na crimson arm-chair in great state. I saw a number of new Fellows\r\nadmitted. They were marched one by one to the president, who rose, and\r\ntaking them by the hand, admitted them. The process costs _£_25.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1831, his finding at Killarney of the beautiful moss _Hookeria\r\nlaetevirens_, hitherto unknown in Ireland, led to the formation of one\r\nof the warmest and most valuable friendships of his life. He forwarded\r\nspecimens, with a characteristic letter, to W. J. Hooker at Glasgow,\r\nand the kind and encouraging reply which he received led to further\r\nletters and eventually to an intimacy which seems to have been prized\r\nequally on both sides. Hooker recognized at once the extraordinary\r\ntalent of the shy young man of twenty, lent him books, asked him to\r\nvisit him, and congratulated him on his critical faculty, predicting\r\nfor him a rapid advance to \"the top of algologists.\" Another life-long\r\nfriendship made about this time was with Mrs Griffiths of Torquay; and\r\nhe numbered Greville and Agardh among his earliest correspondents.\r\nAlready he was deep in his life-task of comparing and describing\r\nplants, working with the restless energy which characterised him. \"I\r\nrise at five every morning,\" he writes, \"and work till breakfast,\r\nexamining or describing the Algae for the 'British Flora[109].' If I do\r\nfive species a day I think it good work. This may seem slow, but there\r\nis much to be compared and _corrected_! for I differ from Dr Hooker on\r\nmany species. Oh, impudence! oh, presumption!\" In 1832 he undertook to\r\ndo the Algae for J. T. Mackay's _Flora Hibernica_, which was published\r\nthree years later; this was his most important contribution to the\r\nbotany of his native land.\r\n\r\nThe death of his father in 1834 broke up Harvey's home life, and his\r\nstrong desire to study the vegetation of distant countries led to\r\nenquiries as to the obtaining of an appointment in the Colonies. New\r\nSouth Wales was first thought of, but it was for the Cape that he\r\nstarted in the following year.\r\n\r\nAsa Gray, a friend of many years' standing, tells, in a notice of\r\nHarvey in the _American Journal of Science and Arts_[110], a curious\r\nstory as to the circumstances attending this momentous change in\r\nHarvey's life. The story is repeated in the notice of Harvey in\r\nSeemann's _Journal of Botany_[111], though not mentioned in the\r\n_Memoir_ edited by his cousin. It seems that, as the result of Harvey's\r\nrepresentations, he obtained through Mr Spring Rice, afterwards Lord\r\nMonteagle, the post of Treasurer at the Cape; but, by an accident,\r\nthe appointment was made out in the name of an elder brother (Joseph\r\nHarvey); and an inopportune change of ministry occurring just at the\r\ntime, frustrated all attempts at rectification. Be that as it may,\r\nJoseph Harvey sailed for South Africa in July 1835, taking his younger\r\nbrother with him as assistant.\r\n\r\nIt was with high hopes that the naturalist started for the Southern\r\nHemisphere. At that time the flora of South Africa was but slightly\r\nknown. About Cape Town itself and near other older centres of\r\ncolonization, indeed, many plants had been collected, both by Dutch and\r\nEnglish; but vast tracts of mountain and veldt, for a thousand miles to\r\nnorth and east, were still unexplored. He describes his excitement on\r\nlanding, and how, after a sleepless night, he started off for the hills\r\nearly next morning, to revel among strange Ericas, Polygalas, Lobelias,\r\nDiosmas, Proteas, and Ixias. He at once settled down to collecting\r\nwith his usual method and energy. From four or five until nine every\r\nmorning he was at work on the mountains or on the shore; after which\r\nseveral hours were devoted to preserving the material. Within a few\r\nweeks he was engaged on the description of new genera and species,\r\nand in three months his herbarium contained 800 species. Already\r\nschemes for organized work leading up to publication were in his mind;\r\nand it seemed as if his task lay open before him; but fate willed\r\notherwise. His brother fell ill within a few months of his arrival,\r\nand a little later a return to Europe was ordered--to no purpose, as\r\nJoseph Harvey died on 26 April, a fortnight after sailing, and it\r\nwas a sad home-coming which the naturalist, who had accompanied the\r\ninvalid, experienced in the June following. He started again for South\r\nAfrica a few weeks later, to take up his brother's duties as Colonial\r\nTreasurer; and remained there for three years, when severe illness,\r\nbrought on by overwork, compelled a return home. But he came back, and\r\nresumed his strenuous life, spending his days in official duties and\r\nhis nights at botany, until, in 1842, a complete break-down forced him\r\nto resign his post, and leave the country. Seven years of his life were\r\nthus devoted to South Africa, and, in spite of the serious inroads\r\non his time and energy caused by two tedious voyages home, as well\r\nas by illness when at the Cape, a great amount of botanical work was\r\naccomplished. He arranged with collectors for the supply of plants from\r\nvarious parts of the country; he got the Government interested in the\r\nnative flora, so that official papers were issued giving instructions\r\nfor collecting and soliciting specimens; and Harvey himself devoted so\r\nmuch time to his hobby that he suggests that his title should be Her\r\nMajesty's Pleasurer-General, instead of Treasurer-General. Every month\r\nbrought its quota of undescribed plants. \"Almost every small package\r\nof specimens received from the Natal, or the Transvaal district,\"\r\nhe writes[112], \"contains not only new species, but new genera; and\r\nsome of the latter are of so marked and isolated a character, as to\r\nlead us to infer in the same region the existence of unknown types\r\nthat may better connect them with Genera or Orders already known.\" To\r\nproduce system in this chaos he compiled and published his _Genera of\r\nSouth African Plants_ (1838), the forerunner of the larger works which\r\nconstitute his principal memorial in the domain of Phanerogamic Botany.\r\nBut the uncongenial climate and the intense application were too great\r\na strain on his health and he reached Europe in 1842, prostrated in\r\nboth body and mind.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the final year of his residence in Africa saw the\r\nproduction of the first of the series of works on seaweeds by which\r\nhis name will ever be best known. His _Manual of British Algae_ was\r\nissued by the Ray Society in 1841, its Introduction dated at Cape Town,\r\nOctober 1840--a modest octavo volume, characterized by the thoroughness\r\nwhich runs through all his work.\r\n\r\nA period of convalescence and apathy followed his return, in which he\r\nwandered about Ireland, doing some desultory botanizing; after which he\r\nsettled in his old home at Limerick, and again took up the uncongenial\r\nduties connected with the family business.\r\n\r\nBut soon a new prospect opened out. The retirement of William Allman\r\nleft vacant the Chair of Botany in Dublin University. Harvey had\r\nlittle hesitation in applying for the post, to which, he points out\r\nto a friend, \"a moderate salary and comfortable College-rooms are\r\nattached. It is an old bachelor place,\" he writes, \"and would in many\r\nways suit me very well. The only thing on the face of it disagreeable\r\nis the _lecturing_, but I don't think I should mind that much, as it\r\nis lawful to have the subjects for the class written down.\" Harvey's\r\ncandidature was viewed favourably by the University authorities, but a\r\ndifficulty arose, inasmuch as the School of Physic Act prescribed that\r\nthe Professor of Botany should hold a medical degree, or the licence\r\nof the College of Physicians. To render him eligible, the degree of\r\nM.D. was at once conferred on Harvey _honoris causa_, but after a\r\ngood deal of discussion this solution of the question was held to be\r\ninadmissible, and George James Allman was appointed to the vacant\r\nchair. Harvey, however, obtained the smaller appointment of Keeper of\r\nthe University Herbarium, which had fallen vacant at about the same\r\ntime owing to the death of Dr Thomas Coulter, the botanical explorer of\r\nCentral Mexico and California.\r\n\r\nHarvey now at last found himself in a congenial post, with a fair\r\namount of leisure, and facilities for scientific work. He presented\r\nhis herbarium of over 10,000 species to the University, which already\r\npossessed Coulter's extensive American collections. \"I am as busy as a\r\nbee these times,\" he writes. \"I rise at 5 a.m. or before it, and work\r\ntill breakfast-time (half-past eight) at the 'Antarctic Algae[113].'\r\nDirectly after breakfast I start for the College, and do not leave\r\nit till five o'clock in the evening. Again at plants till dusk. I am\r\nwriting on the 'Antarctic Algae,' and arranging the Herbarium, and have\r\nbeen working at Coulter's Mexican and Californian plants.\" College\r\nvacations were now usually spent at Kew, staying with his best friend\r\nSir William Hooker, and working hard in the Herbarium. On the way home\r\nfrom the first of these vacations, he went to Torquay, to spend some\r\ntime with his old correspondent, Mrs Griffiths. They went out boating,\r\nhe and the good lady of seventy-six years; and together they visited\r\nthe only British habitat of _Gigartina Teedii_, six miles away, and\r\ngathered that coveted sea-weed in the spot where Mrs Griffiths had\r\ndiscovered it in 1811, the year in which Harvey was born.\r\n\r\nAnother very rare alga which he received about this time, to his great\r\ndelight, was _Thuretia quercifolia_ from Australia, one of the most\r\nremarkable of sea-weeds, bearing oakleaf-shaped red fronds, formed of\r\na beautiful lace-like double network with regular hexagonal openings,\r\nwhich he was himself destined to collect in quantity some years later\r\nat Port Phillip, and to figure in his _Phycologia Australica_[114].\r\nThe circumstances under which this plant was found must have made\r\nHarvey's mouth water.\r\n\r\n\"My specimen,\" he writes, \"was picked up by a lady who accidentally\r\nlanded for a few hours in a little harbour, into which the ship put\r\nduring a gale, and she describes the shore as covered with the most\r\nwonderful profusion of plants and animals. She got all the pocket\r\nhandkerchiefs of the party and filled them with what came first to\r\nhand, and in this hasty way picked up sixty different kinds of sponges,\r\nforty of which are new species, and several Algae, among which was the\r\nabove described beauty. Her husband (a captain) is going out again, and\r\npromises to gather all he can meet with. Don't I hope he may have a run\r\nin again in a squall!\"\r\n\r\nHarvey now commenced the publication of the first of his larger works\r\non seaweeds--the classical _Phycologia Britannica_, a series of 360\r\ncoloured quarto plates, drawn on stone by his own hand, representing\r\nall the species then known to inhabit the British Isles, and\r\naccompanied by suitable letterpress: the whole taking five years to\r\ncomplete. This work represented an immense advance in the knowledge of\r\nBritish sea-weeds, and, by the beauty and excellence of its plates, did\r\nmuch to popularize the study of these interesting plants.\r\n\r\nIn the following year he began his _Nereis Australis, or Algae of the\r\nSouthern Ocean_. This was the first fruits of a comprehensive scheme of\r\npublication, which in its entirety was to \"form a compendious picture\r\nof the vegetation of the ocean,\" the _Nereis Australis_ being followed\r\nby a similar _Nereis Tropica_ and _Nereis Borealis_; but only a section\r\nof the scheme was carried out, and publication stopped with the issue\r\nof 120 pages of letterpress and fifty coloured plates, drawn as usual\r\nby Harvey himself. In 1849 he issued _The Sea-side Book_, a popular\r\naccount of the natural history of the sea-shore, which ran through\r\nseveral editions.\r\n\r\nAbout this time he secured an additional appointment which, while it\r\nadded to his professional duties, also increased his opportunities for\r\nresearch. The Royal Dublin Society, founded in 1731 for the improvement\r\nof husbandry, manufactures, and other useful arts and sciences, and\r\naided by considerable government funds, had long since embarked on\r\ncomprehensive schemes for the development of both science and art.\r\nTo its activity is due the foundation and building up of many of the\r\nleading educational institutions in Dublin--the National Museum, the\r\nNational Library, the Botanic Gardens at Glasnevin, the Metropolitan\r\nSchool of Art. The Society had established also professorships of\r\nzoology, botany, natural philosophy, chemistry, and so on. In 1848 the\r\nprofessorship of botany became vacant by the death of Dr Samuel Litton,\r\nand Harvey applied for the post. These appointments were made by the\r\nvote of the members at large, and strongly against his inclination,\r\nhe had to enter on a personal canvass, of some experiences of which\r\nhe gives a half humourous, half pathetic account in a letter to N.\r\nB. Ward, of \"Wardian case\" fame, who throughout life was one of his\r\nmost regular correspondents. The issue was satisfactory, Harvey being\r\nelected by a three-fourths majority. This appointment placed him in\r\ncontrol of the Glasnevin Botanic Gardens, of which Dr David Moore, so\r\nwell known by his work on the Irish flora, was curator. It made him\r\nresponsible besides for the delivery annually of courses of botanical\r\nlectures in Dublin, and also, at intervals, in selected towns in\r\nvarious parts of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1849 Harvey accepted an invitation from the\r\nSmithsonian Institution and Harvard University to deliver twelve\r\nlectures on botany at the Lowell Institute at Boston, and others\r\nat Washington. The subject he chose for the Boston course was a\r\ncomprehensive survey of the plant-world, from the point of view of the\r\n\"progressive organization of the vegetable entity.\" The cryptogams\r\nhad a place of honour, four lectures being devoted to Algae: it is\r\ninteresting to note that the Fungi, which he designates \"the most\r\naristocratic of Crypts--_fruges consumere nati_,\" he placed immediately\r\nbelow the Flowering Plants, for reasons which, no doubt, he gave in\r\nhis discourses. He sailed from Liverpool in July. Ocean traffic had\r\nbeen revolutionized since his last voyage from the Cape; instead of\r\na dawdling sailing-ship, a steamer transported him in ten days to\r\nNova Scotia; and with some of the old excitement with which he had\r\nstarted on his first climb up Table Mountain, he rambled away into\r\nthe dark spruce woods, through the rich undergrowth of Kalmias, Ledums\r\nand Andromedas, with Sarracenias and Orchids rising from among the\r\nSphagnums in the damper spots. He dredged and shore-collected also,\r\nbut the seaweed flora was not rich. Thence he passed to New York,\r\nwhich he describes as like twenty Birkenheads and a dozen Liverpools,\r\nwith slices from London and Paris, all huddled together, and painted\r\nbright red, with green windows. He visited Niagara and Quebec, and then\r\ntravelled to Boston, where he was welcomed by Asa Gray, who was his\r\nhost during his stay.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were well attended, and Harvey seems to have been\r\nsatisfied with them and with the reception which they received; a\r\npopular lecture on seaweeds at the Franklin Institute at Providence\r\nwas largely attended. These discourses, and the introductions and\r\nconversations that ensued, had more than a passing interest, as\r\nrecruits were enrolled for alga-collecting, who subsequently supplied\r\nvaluable material for his work on North American seaweeds. He saw\r\nall that was best of scientific society in Boston and New York, and\r\nmet many of the great men of that generation--Agassiz, Bailey, Dana,\r\nLongfellow, Leidy, Pickering, Prescott, Silliman, Daniel Webster,\r\nOliver Wendell Holmes. Having fulfilled his engagements and revisited\r\nthe family of his late brother Jacob in New York, he turned his face\r\nsouthward in January for a collecting tour along the Atlantic sea-board.\r\n\r\nAfter brief stays at Wilmington and Charleston, where he did a little\r\nbotanizing, and sent to Kew a box-full of Dionaea, he arrived by boat\r\nat Key West one Sunday midnight in pouring rain, to spend the remaining\r\nhours of darkness in wandering about seeking a lodging. But by morning\r\nhis fortunes had mended, and he spent a busy and pleasant month there,\r\ncollecting by day, dodging mosquitos by night, and living mainly upon\r\nturtle and roast turkey, more ordinary foods being scarce. He made\r\nlarge collections of Algae, almost every day bringing to him new and\r\nbeautiful forms. He had hoped to have the company of Prof. Bailey on\r\nthis trip, but illness prevented this, and he had to carry out his work\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nMarch saw him back in Charleston, where he attended the annual meeting\r\nof the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Then\r\nto Washington, where he delivered four lectures at the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution. At Charleston he again met Agassiz, and once more records\r\nthe profound impression which the American zoologist produced upon him.\r\n\"His fine thought,\" he writes, \"of reforming the classifications of\r\nanimals by a more intimate study of their young in the various stages\r\nfrom embryonic life to full development, grows apace; and if he lives\r\nto bring out his conception of a system based upon this, it will not\r\nonly crown his memory for ever, but be the greatest step of the present\r\nage in zoological science.... He is certainly a man of extraordinary\r\ngenius, great energy, and with the most rapid inductive powers I have\r\never known. I could not help saying to myself, as I sat and listened,\r\nWell, it is pleasant to be hearing all this, as it is uttered, and\r\nfor the first time. If one lives to be an old man, one will have to\r\nsay, 'I remember to have heard Agassiz say so and so,' and then every\r\none will listen, just as we should do to a person who had conversed\r\nwith Linnaeus or Cuvier.\" We must remember that this appreciation\r\nof Agassiz's ideas was written nine years before the publication of\r\nDarwin's _Origin of Species_, and at a time when American men of\r\nscience were much interested in a controversy as to whether mankind are\r\nall descended from Adam and Eve, or from several separate creations\r\nin different parts of the world. One of his last letters written on\r\nAmerican soil contains a note on another subject, significant in the\r\nlight of subsequent events. \"I have been twice at sittings of the\r\nSenate, and have heard a good sensible speech on the Union question,\r\nwhich is now agitating folk here.... The bone of contention is Slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1850 saw him once again settled in Dublin, with a\r\ngreat accumulation of work on hand. Part of the summer was spent in\r\ncollecting Algae on the coast of Antrim; and he met again his friends\r\nAsa Gray and his wife, who were visiting Europe. Another acquaintance\r\nmade at this time, which ripened into a warm friendship, was the result\r\nof the finding by Mrs Alfred Gatty, well-known as a writer of fiction,\r\nof the _Chrysymenia orcadensis_ of Harvey at Filey, in fruit for the\r\nfirst time--the examination of which convinced Harvey that the Orkney\r\nplant was only a variety of _Chrysymenia rosea_ (_Lomentaria rosea_\r\nThuret). Mrs Gatty became a useful ally in the collecting of seaweeds,\r\nand a valued friend; Harvey's influence is seen in her _British\r\nSeaweeds_, published in 1863.\r\n\r\nThe year 1851 saw the completion of the _Phycologia Britannica_, and\r\nhe at once set to work on his _Nereis Boreali-Americana_, published in\r\nthree parts in the _Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge_--a work\r\nof 550 quarto pages containing an account of all the known species of\r\nNorth American Algae, and 50 coloured plates, lithographed as usual\r\nwith his own hand--a fine piece of work, and one which has not yet been\r\nsuperseded. This was a time of strenuous labour, for already he was\r\nplanning a still more extended foreign tour; but he found time in the\r\nautumn of 1852 for a trip to Switzerland with Sir William Hooker and\r\nother friends.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1853, Harvey set out on the most extended scientific\r\nexpedition of his life. So far his collecting had been done in Europe,\r\nSouth Africa, and North America. Now he was to visit the Indian Ocean\r\nand Australasia, and to investigate their seaweed flora, as yet but\r\nlittle known.\r\n\r\nA short stay was made in Egypt, and a sea-shore ramble at Aden yielded\r\n_Padina pavonia_ and a few other seaweeds, but otherwise he made no\r\nstop till Ceylon was reached. There he travelled a good deal, but\r\nseaweed collecting was not so successful as he had hoped. Some of the\r\nplaces explored proved unproductive, and the prevalence of the monsoon\r\nrendered collecting difficult or impossible. But the last three weeks,\r\nspent at Belligam Bay and Point de Galle, yielded excellent results,\r\nand he proceeded to Singapore en route for Albany, with a collection of\r\nabout 5000 specimens of Algae.\r\n\r\nThe first work in Australia was done in the extreme south-west. Here\r\nhe gathered seaweeds assiduously in King George's Sound, but the\r\nground proved rather poor, though one welcome storm brought him a rich\r\nharvest, of which he preserved 700 specimens in one day. He moved on to\r\nCape Riche, to the eastward, travelling through the bush on foot, and\r\nthus making intimate acquaintance with the interesting vegetation as\r\nwell as the fauna of the district traversed. Cape Riche proved poor\r\nalso, and he went northward to Perth, where he met James Drummond, the\r\npioneer of West Australian botany, formerly of the Botanic Garden at\r\nCork, and the discoverer of _Spiranthes Romanzoffiana_ in the British\r\nIslands. At Perth he struck good ground. \"This place is an excellent\r\nlocality for Algae,\" he writes, \"I am daily finding fresh ones, and\r\nhave the prospect of a good harvest of novelty and interest.... The\r\ndays are too short for my work. My best collections are made at Garden\r\nIsland, nine miles distant. I have been twice landed for a two hours'\r\nwalk, and on both occasions collected so much that it took three days\r\nto lay them on paper.\" Rottnest Island also proved highly productive,\r\nand he gives a very attractive picture of the great rock-pools on\r\nthe limestone reefs, filled with brilliant seaweeds, many of them\r\nundescribed. Here he lived in the deserted convict establishment, and\r\namassed a large and valuable collection.\r\n\r\nThence he went to Melbourne, where he collected at several points about\r\nPort Phillip, notably on Phillip Island; after which he sailed for\r\nTasmania, where at Georgetown he had a month's successful work with the\r\nRev. J. Fereday, himself an enthusiastic student of botany, seaweeds\r\nincluded. Passing through Hobart, he obtained permission to visit Port\r\nArthur, at that time a great convict station, for which he sailed on\r\nMarch 1, 1855, passing the grand basaltic headlands of Cape Raoul and\r\nCape Pillar. At Port Arthur amid exquisite natural surroundings marred\r\nby the presence of chained prisoners, armed warders, and sentry-lines\r\nof fierce dogs, he worked successfully, doing much shore-collecting,\r\nand dredging with the aid of a crew of convicts and armed guards. After\r\na little rather unsuccessful collecting at Sydney and Newcastle he\r\nsailed for New Zealand, where he spent a few weeks at Auckland. While\r\nthe terrestrial flora proved highly interesting to him, he found the\r\nshore poor in Algae; but he enlisted a useful recruit for collecting,\r\nin Mr Knight, Auditor-General, who undertook to collect and send him\r\nfurther material.\r\n\r\nThe 26th July, 1851, found him at Tonga Taboo, in the Friendly Islands,\r\nrevelling in his first glimpse of nature in mid-Pacific. The fringing\r\nreef proved somewhat disappointing, for amid the multitudinous\r\nand many-coloured animal forms only a few green Algae were to be\r\nfound. Harvey spent six months in the Pacific, visiting island after\r\nisland according as the mission boats supplied a means of transport,\r\ncollecting seaweeds and a good many marine animals. At that time social\r\nconditions in the South Seas were very different from what they are\r\nnow. The adjoining Fiji Island group, for instance, was still in a\r\nsavage state: the captain of the mission vessel told Harvey how, only\r\nfour years before, he had seen one hundred human bodies laid out for\r\na great feast, and cannibalism was still a habitual practice there;\r\nbut the Friendly Islands, though but recently in a similar condition,\r\nseem already to have deserved their name, and Harvey's experiences of\r\nthe natives, with whom he was much in contact, appear to have been of\r\nthe pleasantest description; in Fiji also, where several weeks were\r\nspent, the founding of a Christian mission (permitted only two years\r\nbefore after eighteen years' refusal) had already greatly altered\r\nlocal practices; devil-worship and cannibalism were rapidly dying\r\nout. Harvey, applying at the mission station for a responsible guide,\r\nwas furnished with a man entitled \"Koroe,\" which, it appeared, was\r\nan honourable title \"something equivalent to a C.B. in England,\" and\r\nbestowed only on a person who had committed at least five murders.\r\nHarvey returned to Sydney, and thence to Europe by Valparaiso and\r\nPanama, having a severe bout of fever on the way. He reached home in\r\nOctober, 1856, after an absence of over three years.\r\n\r\nHere an important change of life awaited him. G. J. Allman succeeded to\r\nthe Natural History chair in Edinburgh, rendered vacant by the death of\r\nEdward Forbes, and Harvey was elected to the chair in Trinity College,\r\nDublin, the difficulties which led to his rejection twelve years\r\nearlier being not raised on this occasion, though the law remained the\r\nsame. At the same time, the incorporation of the several Dublin Society\r\nprofessorships in the newly founded Museum of Irish Industry (now\r\nthe Royal College of Science for Ireland), gave him additional work,\r\nas his post was converted into a Natural History and Economic chair.\r\nHowever, the considerable increase of lecturing and teaching thus\r\nbrought upon him did not prevent his pushing on vigorously with the now\r\nlarge arrears of phycological work. His first action was to finish and\r\npublish the third and last section of the _Nereis Boreali-Americana_\r\nand then bring to a conclusion his enumeration of the seaweed flora\r\nof North America. This was accomplished in 1858, and in the same year\r\nhe began the publication of the results of his work in Australia. The\r\n_Phycologia Australica_, which was issued in parts during the ensuing\r\nfive years, ran to five volumes, each containing sixty coloured plates,\r\nand descriptions of all the species known from Australasian waters.\r\nIn the year following the launching of this work, he commenced the\r\npublication of two important treatises on the phanerogamic flora of\r\nSouth Africa. In the first of these, the well-known _Flora Capensis_,\r\nhe had the co-operation of Dr O. W. Sonder of Hamburg. This extensive\r\nwork he did not live to complete; the third volume, which ran as far\r\nas the end of the Campanulaceae, being published the year before his\r\ndeath. The other work was his _Thesaurus Capensis_, a series of plates\r\nof rare or interesting South African plants, designed to supplement and\r\nillustrate the unillustrated _Flora_; of this he lived to issue only\r\ntwo volumes, each containing one hundred plates.\r\n\r\nHarvey's home life, which for several years had been very lonely, was\r\ntransformed in 1861, when, at the age of fifty, he was married to Miss\r\nPhelps of Limerick, whom he had long known. But almost immediately\r\nafterwards the shadow of death appeared, haemorrhage from the lungs\r\nwarning him that his newly found happiness might not endure. After a\r\nsummer spent at his favourite Miltown Malbay, on the wild coast of\r\nClare, he was able to resume his college duties and his work on _Flora\r\nCapensis_. Although he never fully recovered his health, he laboured\r\ndiligently at the works he had in hand. He had a noble example of\r\ncontinued devotion to science in his old friend Sir William Hooker,\r\nwhom he again visited, on returning from a tour on the Continent, in\r\nthe autumn of 1863, to find him, in his seventy-ninth year, finishing\r\noff the last volume of his _Species Filicum_, and \"already beginning\r\nto nibble at another book.\" This was a further work on ferns, the\r\n_Synopsis Filicum_, on which Hooker was busily engaged until within a\r\nfew days of his death in the summer of 1865; it was completed by J.\r\nG. Baker and published three years later. During the winter of 1865,\r\nHarvey himself became seriously ill, and, an immediate change to a mild\r\nclimate being recommended, he and his wife went to stay at Torquay with\r\nLady Hooker, and there he died on 15th May, 1866.\r\n\r\nHarvey was only fifty-five years of age when he died, but he had won\r\nfor himself a foremost place among systematic botanists. Life, as\r\nLubbock has said, is measured by thought and action, not by time; and\r\naccording to this standard, Harvey's life-cup was already full and\r\nrunning over. He had used to the utmost the gifts which he possessed.\r\nThe capital with which he entered on his career comprised a critical\r\neye, a deft hand, and that scientific enthusiasm without which no\r\nbotanist ever travels far. On the other side of the account, he had\r\ntwo serious deterrents, a rather delicate body, and a complete absence\r\nof scientific training. \"_Apropos_ of dissection,\" he writes to Hooker\r\nin his younger days, \"I am a miserable manipulator, and should be\r\nvery grateful for a few lessons.\" From the beginning he had a shrewd\r\nperception of what lay within his reach, and what was beyond it.\r\n\"The extent to which I mean to go in botany,\" he wrote at twenty-one\r\nyears, \"is to know British plants of all kinds as well as possible; to\r\nknow Algae of all countries _specially_ well; to collect all foreign\r\nCryptogamia that may fall in my way, and to know them _moderately_\r\nwell.... My reason for choosing the _Algae_ is pure compassion; they\r\nbeing sadly neglected by the present generation, though at a former\r\ntime they were in high favour.\"\r\n\r\nIn the letters written even in boyhood we see foreshadowed the\r\ndirection and extent of his future researches. \"Exactly what he\r\ndetermined in youth to accomplish,\" says Dr John Todhunter in his\r\nPreface to Harvey's _Memoir_, \"he accomplished; the work which he took\r\nupon himself to do he did, honestly and thoroughly; the fame which\r\nhe desired to achieve, he achieved.\" He saw that his strength lay\r\nin discrimination, description, and illustration, and to these--the\r\nnecessary census task which forms the groundwork on which great\r\ntheories may be built up--he confined himself.\r\n\r\nThe latter years of his life fell within that stimulating period which\r\nfollowed the publication of Darwin's _Origin of Species_. But in the\r\nbattle of giants which ensued he took no part. His attitude, indeed,\r\nwas rather that of an amused spectator; and in the letters which are\r\navailable, his references to the great controversy of the day, and\r\nallied topics, are mostly in a playful vein. \"I do not know how cats\r\npurr,\" he writes to his friend Mrs Gatty, \"and am glad you asked....\r\nHave you never felt a something stop your own windpipe when pleased or\r\ngrieved, when suddenly affected either way? 'Tis the first gurgle of a\r\npurr; you were a cat once, away in the ages, and this is a part of the\r\nremains.\" Almost his only contribution to the literature of natural\r\nselection was a \"serio-comic squib,\" which was read before the Dublin\r\nUniversity Zoological and Botanical Association on 17 February, 1860\r\nand subsequently printed for private circulation, entitled \"A Guess as\r\nto the Probable Origin of the Human Animal considered by the light of\r\nMr Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection, and in opposition to Lamarck's\r\nnotion of a Monkey Parentage.\" Darwin thought this production a little\r\nunworthy of the author. \"I am not sorry for a natural opportunity of\r\nwriting to Harvey,\" he says, \"just to show that I was not piqued at\r\nhis turning me and my book into ridicule, not that I think it was a\r\nproceeding that I deserved, or worthy of him[115].\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Harvey rejoices over Charles Kingsley's _Water Babies_, and\r\nespecially over the sly fun which is poked at Darwinism, and also at\r\ncertain types of men of science.\r\n\r\nOnly once did he enter the lists with a serious criticism, when, in the\r\n_Gardeners' Chronicle_[116], he cites the case of a monstrous Begonia\r\nin objection to Darwin's views. Harvey, indeed, did not like the new\r\ntheory. \"I am fully disposed to admit natural selection as a _vera\r\ncausa_ of much change,\" he writes, \"but not as the _vera causa_ of\r\nspecies.\" Further than this he could not go, though much impressed with\r\nthe arguments drawn from geographical distribution. \"I heartily wish\r\nwe were nearer in accord,\" writes Darwin at the end of a long letter\r\nto Harvey, \"but we must remain content to be as wide asunder as the\r\npoles, but without, thank God, any malice or other ill-feeling[117].\"\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that Harvey took but little part in influencing\r\nthe thought of his time; the materials for his work were gathered not\r\nfrom his own creative brain, nor from the thoughts of other men, but\r\ndirect from Nature's storehouses; his study was the far-stretching\r\nshore, his companions\r\n\r\n          \"The toiling surges,\r\n  Laden with sea-weed from the rocks,\"\r\n\r\nhis duty the describing with pen and pencil the harvest of the sea. In\r\nhis works, he rises above mere technical description of the species\r\nwith which he is dealing. His mind is filled with the beauty and\r\nwonder of plants; and he strives to impress the reader with the deep\r\ninterest of the study of botany. He endeavours always to popularize\r\nhis favourite pursuit by means of pleasant general introductions, and\r\nto promote a better knowledge of seaweeds or of flowering plants by\r\nappealing to his readers to collect, and by giving instructions for the\r\ngathering and preserving of specimens.\r\n\r\nHe derived a peculiar satisfaction from the thought that, at his post\r\nat Trinity College, Dublin, he was building up a great permanent\r\ncollection that would be useful to future generations of botanists.\r\n\"Here,\" he writes, \"I sit like a turnspit roasting the meat, and when\r\nI am gone I suppose another dog will be put in my place. The Herbarium\r\nwill not be broken up. I am content, for I seem to be working for some\r\nlittle purpose. I should just like to leave it in better order--to get\r\nthrough the arrears--and to return borrowed specimens.\" It was the same\r\nthought that prompted him to the publication of the great descriptive\r\nworks which his rapidity and skill with pen and pencil enabled him to\r\ncomplete despite frequent intervals of illness. He devoted himself\r\nto his task with intense application. \"Twenty minutes,\" he writes\r\nfrom South Africa in the middle of the stifling summer, \"is my fair\r\nallowance for a drawing, with all its microscopical analysis.\"\r\n\r\nFrom his letters, and from the reminiscences of persons who remember\r\nhim, one gathers that Harvey was a very lovable sort of man. Shy\r\nand retiring, and diffident as to his own powers, with a deeply\r\naffectionate nature, he was equally prone to singing the praises of his\r\nfriends, and to disparaging himself. \"If I lean to glorify any one,\" he\r\nwrites to William Thompson of Belfast, \"it is Mrs Griffiths, to whom I\r\nowe much of the little acquaintance I have with the variations to which\r\nthese plants [the seaweeds] are subject, and who is always ready to\r\nsupply me with fruits of plants which every one else finds barren. She\r\nis worth ten thousand other collectors.\" Writing of Harveya, a genus\r\nof South African Scrophularineae which Hooker had just named in his\r\nhonour, he comments, \"'Tis _apropos_ to give me a genus of Parasites,\r\nas I am one of those weak characters that draw their pleasures from\r\nothers, and their support and sustenance too, seeing I quickly pine, if\r\nI have not some one to torment.\" He in his turn loved to commemorate\r\nhis friends, or others in whom he felt an interest, by naming after\r\nthem new genera of plants--Apjohnia, Areschougia, Ballia, Backhousia,\r\nBellotia, Bowerbankia, Drummondita, Curdiea, Greyia, Mackaya, and\r\nmany others. The names of some of his favourite authors are similarly\r\nenshrined, as Crabbea, Evelyna. Indeed, when at Niagara he saw an\r\ninscription to a young lady who fell over the cliff when gathering\r\nflowers--\r\n\r\n    Miss Ruggs at the age of twenty-three\r\n    Was launched into eternity,\r\n\r\nhe comments \"Poor thing! I must call a plant after her--_Ruggia_ would\r\nsound well.\" He had indeed a love of all living things. Writing to\r\nMrs Gray on the death of her favourite dog, he tells how he felt so\r\nashamed of being so deeply moved when in South Africa by the death of\r\nhis pet ostrich, that he foreswore any similar entanglement, and kept\r\nhis vow ever since. Of serious griefs he had many; the death of several\r\nbeloved brothers and sisters who predeceased him, would have been well\r\nnigh intolerable to him but for the profound religious feeling which\r\nsustained and helped him throughout life, and which robbed death of all\r\nits terrors.\r\n\r\nI cannot do better than conclude with some words in which Asa Gray\r\nsummed up Harvey's work and character shortly after his decease[118]:\r\n\"He was a keen observer and a capital describer. He investigated\r\naccurately, worked easily and readily with microscope, pencil, and pen,\r\nwrote perspicuously, and where the subject permitted, with captivating\r\ngrace; affording, in his lighter productions, mere glimpses of the warm\r\nand poetical imagination, delicate humour, refined feeling, and sincere\r\ngoodness which were charmingly revealed in intimate intercourse and\r\ncorrespondence, and which won the admiration and the love of all who\r\nknew him well. Handsome in person, gentle and fascinating in manners,\r\ngenial and warm-hearted but of very retiring disposition, simple in his\r\ntastes and unaffectedly devout, it is not surprising that he attracted\r\nfriends wherever he went, so that his death will be sensibly felt on\r\nevery continent and in the islands of the sea.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[107] _Memoir of W.

He was the second son of\r\nCharles Berkeley, whose wife was a sister of P. G. Munn, the well-known\r\nwater-colour artist. His family belonged to the Spetchley branch\r\nof the Berkeleys, and had been resident for several generations in\r\nNorthamptonshire. Berkeley received his preliminary education at\r\nthe Oundle Grammar School and afterwards at Rugby, entered Christ's\r\nCollege, Cambridge, in 1821, and graduated as 5th Senior Optime in\r\n1825. He was ordained in 1826, and his first clerical duty was the\r\ncuracy of St John's, Margate. In 1833 he became Perpetual Curate\r\nof Apethorpe and Wood Newton, Northamptonshire, and resided at the\r\nneighbouring village of King's Cliffe, a name familiar to every\r\nmycologist as being the habitat of numerous species of fungi, first\r\nrecorded as members of the British Flora. In 1868 he was appointed\r\nVicar of Sibbertoft, near Market Harborough, where he died on the 30th\r\nJuly, 1889, at the age of 86 years.\r\n\r\nAs a boy Berkeley was much devoted to the study of nature, paying\r\nspecial attention to the structure and habits of animals; he also at\r\nan early age made a somewhat extensive conchological collection.\r\nThis tendency was to some extent fostered at Rugby, but the influence\r\nexercised by Professor Henslow during Berkeley's time at Cambridge,\r\nand the opportunities of studying the progress of research made in\r\nthe various branches of Natural History, were the chief factors that\r\ndetermined Berkeley to enter seriously on the study of what at the time\r\nwas styled Natural History.\r\n\r\nHis first published paper was \"On new species of _Modiola_ and\r\n_Serpula_\" (_Zoological Journal_, 1828). It was followed by \"On\r\nthe internal structure of _Helicolimax Lamarckii_\"; \"On _Dentalium\r\nsubulatum_\"; \"On the animals of _Voluta_ and _Assiminia_\" (idem\r\n1832-34); and \"On British _Serpulae_\" and \"_Dreissenia polymorpha_\"\r\n(_Magazine of Natural History_, 1834-36).\r\n\r\nA series of beautifully executed coloured drawings and dissections,\r\nillustrating Berkeley's zoological studies, may be seen at the\r\nHerbarium, Kew. Although all Berkeley's publications up to this time\r\ndealt with zoological subjects, yet the study of Botany had been by no\r\nmeans neglected, and about this time having made the acquaintance of\r\nDr Harvey of Dublin, Dr Greville of Edinburgh, the author of _Scottish\r\nCryptogamic Flora_, and of Captain Carmichael of Appin, N.B., a trio\r\nof the most celebrated cryptogamists of the age, Berkeley forsook the\r\nserious study of zoological subjects, and devoted the whole of his\r\nleisure time to the lower forms of plant life. Living at Margate, the\r\nmarine algae naturally attracted Berkeley's attention, and in 1833 he\r\npublished his _Gleanings of British Algae_, consisting of a series of\r\ndetailed investigations on the structure of the minute and obscure\r\nforms of marine and fresh-water species. This work, illustrated by\r\ntwenty coloured plates, was originally intended to be included in\r\nthe supplement to Dr Greville's _Scottish Cryptogamic Flora_, but in\r\nconsequence of the discontinuance of that most excellent work, was\r\nissued as an independent booklet.\r\n\r\nFrom the first Berkeley was deeply interested in the fungi, and\r\npractically all his subsequent work was devoted to this group of\r\nplants, and although well versed in general Cryptogamic Botany, it\r\nwas in the field of Mycology that his laurels were won. A review of\r\nthe work done can be most conveniently discussed under three separate\r\nheadings--Systematic Mycology, Morphology and Literature, and Plant\r\nPathology, respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Systematic Mycology._\r\n\r\nUnder the title _British Fungi_, four fascicles of dried and\r\nwell-prepared specimens, numbering in all 350 species, were issued\r\nbetween 1836 and 1843. In those days exsiccatæ were not issued from a\r\ncommercial standpoint, as is too frequently the case at the present\r\nday, but represented the outcome of careful investigation on the part\r\nof the author, hence Berkeley's exsiccatæ are at a premium at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 Berkeley first corresponded with Sir W. J. Hooker on matters\r\ndealing with cryptogams, and in one of his early letters stated that\r\nhe had devoted much time to the study of fungi, more especially to\r\nthe extensive genus _Agaricus_, which at that period included all the\r\ngill-bearing fungi. At this time, Sir William was engaged in preparing\r\nthe volumes dealing with cryptogams, as supplementary to _The English\r\nFlora_ of Sir James Edward Smith, and approached Berkeley on the\r\nsubject of undertaking the section dealing with Agarics, in the volume\r\ndevoted to the fungi. Berkeley agreed to this arrangement, and was\r\nfinally induced to describe the whole of the fungi. A footnote at the\r\ncommencement of the volume by Sir W. J. Hooker is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"When the printing of the species of this, the 2nd Part of the Class\r\n_Cryptogamia_, was commenced, I thought myself highly fortunate to have\r\nobtained the assistance of my valued friend, the _Rev. M. J. Berkeley_,\r\nin preparing the first Tribe, _Pileati_. I have now to express my\r\ncordial acknowledgements (in which I am satisfied I shall be joined\r\nby every Botanist in the country) to that gentleman for having kindly\r\nundertaken to prepare the whole of this vast family for the press: and\r\nit is certain that the task could not have fallen into better hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe volume contains detailed descriptions of all British fungi known\r\nat the time, amounting to 1360 species, included in 155 genera, the\r\ngreat majority of which had been studied by the author in a living\r\ncondition, and also compared with specimens contained in various\r\nexsiccatæ and with the very extensive collection owned by Sir W. J.\r\nHooker. The appearance of this book at once placed Berkeley in the\r\nfront rank of Mycologists, and it was universally admitted as the most\r\ncomplete Mycologic Flora of any country extant; and furthermore, so far\r\nas accurate information, and a true sense of the conception of species\r\nare concerned, the same statement holds good at the present day. At\r\nthis date our knowledge of extra-European fungi was almost nil, with\r\nthe exception of a few woody cosmopolitan species collected by various\r\ntravellers, more as matters of curiosity than for the advancement of\r\nour knowledge of the fungus-flora of the world.\r\n\r\nOpportunity alone was required by Berkeley, and such opportunity was\r\nreadily afforded by Sir W. J. Hooker, who placed unreservedly in\r\nBerkeley's hands the various collections of exotic fungi received\r\nat Kew from time to time. This practice was continued by the two\r\nsucceeding Directors at Kew, Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker and Sir William\r\nThiselton-Dyer. Such unrivalled opportunities were utilised to the\r\nfullest extent by Berkeley, who soon manifested by his treatment of\r\nthe material placed in his hands a thorough grasp of the subject, and\r\nfor nearly half a century practically all collections of exotic fungi\r\npassed through Berkeley's hands. During this period 6000 new species\r\nwere described, and in numerous instances illustrated, including many\r\nnew genera from all parts of the world, arctic, antarctic, tropical and\r\ntemperate. Botanists were now enabled, for the first time, to grasp the\r\ntrue significance of the fungus-flora of the world, which numerically\r\nranks next to Phanerogams, and which was shown to exercise an influence\r\non life on the globe in general, not realised before Berkeley's time.\r\nThe better known European genera of fungi, many of which appeared to be\r\nsharply defined, and by some mycologists considered to be of ordinal\r\nimportance, could now be estimated at their true value and relegated to\r\ntheir true position in the scheme of classification rendered possible\r\nby a good knowledge of the range of structure presented by the fungi\r\nof the world at large. As regards geographical distribution, Berkeley\r\nrepeatedly emphasized the fact that the fungi are more cosmopolitan\r\nthan any other known group of plants, and that their abundance at any\r\nplace during a given period was almost entirely dependent on conditions\r\nfavouring the development of the higher forms of plant life, fungi\r\nonly following in the wake of such, and never posing as pioneers,\r\non account of the nature of their food. Amongst the numerous novel\r\ntypes of extra-European fungi described by Berkeley, it is somewhat\r\ndifficult to indicate briefly even a few of the most striking forms.\r\nPerhaps his genus _Broomeia_ stands out pre-eminent. It belongs\r\nto the puffball group of fungi, and is unique in that family--the\r\nGasteromycetaceae--in having numerous individuals springing from, and\r\nimbedded in a common sterile base or stroma. It is a native of the Cape\r\nof Good Hope. The following is Berkeley's dedication of this genus to\r\nhis friend and co-worker, C. E. Broome, M.A., of Bath. \"Nomen dedi in\r\nhonorem amicissimi, C. E. Broome, armigeri, Tuberacearum Anglicarum\r\naccuratissimi indagatoris, cujus pene solius laboribus extant hodie\r\nviginti species indigenae fungorum hypogaeorum.\" _Broomeia congregata_\r\nBerk., is described and figured in Hooker's _London Journal of Botany_,\r\n1844. Certain club-shaped fungi parasitic on caterpillars, belonging\r\nto the genus _Cordyceps_, occurring on buried caterpillars in New\r\nZealand, are the giants of their tribe, measuring up to eighteen\r\ninches in length. Finally, Berkeley first introduced to our notice\r\nmany of those quaint fungi belonging to the group including our well\r\nknown \"stinkhorn\"--_Phallus impudicus_ L.--and cleared up many points\r\nin their structure previously unknown. Fries, the most distinguished\r\nmycologist of his time, writes as follows in his Preface to\r\n_Hymenomycetes Europaei_; \"Desideratissima vero Synopsis Hymenomycetum\r\nextra-europearum, qualem solus praestere valebit Rev. Berkeley.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Berkeley's researches on exotic fungi, a task in itself\r\ntoo comprehensive for most men to grapple with, he continued to study\r\nthe British fungi, and, mostly in collaboration with his friend, Mr\r\nC. E. Broome, published a long series of articles in the _Annals and\r\nMagazine of Natural History_, from 1837 down to the year 1883. In these\r\narticles 2027 species of fungi are enumerated, mostly new, or species\r\nnew to Britain, and consist mainly of critical notes on the morphology\r\nand affinities of the fungi under consideration, and will compel the\r\nattention of mycologists for all time.\r\n\r\nFrom the above brief account it may perhaps be concluded that Berkeley\r\nwas essentially a systematist and founder of new species. Owing to\r\nthe vast amount of material that passed through his hands, he was so\r\nperforce, but his leaning was always rather towards the biological and\r\nmorphological side of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morphology and Literature._\r\n\r\nThe first important paper dealing with the morphology of the hymenial\r\nstructure in Fungi, is entitled, \"On the Fructification of the\r\nPileate and Clavate Tribes of the Hymenomycetous Fungi,\" _Annals of\r\nNat. Hist._, 1838. Here is clearly demonstrated for the first time,\r\nthe universal occurrence of basidia bearing spores at their summit,\r\nthroughout the entire group of fungi known to-day as the Hymenomycetes,\r\nincluding Agaricaceae, Thelephoraceae, Clavariaceae, etc. This\r\nimportant discovery rendered possible the basis of a classification on\r\nmorphological grounds, which holds good at the present day. A careful\r\nstudy of the text and illustrations demonstrates the fact that Berkeley\r\nwas perfectly well acquainted with all the essential details of the\r\nhymenium, many of which have been repeatedly rediscovered and described\r\nunder new names, in ignorance of the fact that such structures had\r\npreviously been equally well described.\r\n\r\nBerkeley continued his investigations on the structure of the hymenium,\r\nand his next paper, entitled \"Sur la fructification des genres\r\n_Lycoperdon_, _Phallus_ et de quelques autres genres voisins,\" in\r\n_Annal. Sci. Nat._ Ser. 2, vol. XII. (1839), demonstrated the universal\r\npresence of basidia bearing spores at their summit in the family now\r\nknown as the Gasteromycetes. This research on the part of Berkeley led\r\nto the universal adoption of the two primary divisions of the Fungi;\r\nBasidiomycetes, having the spores borne at the apex of a basidium; and\r\nAscomycetes, having the spores produced within specialised sacs, or\r\nasci.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the _Introduction to Cryptogamic Botany_ appeared, which\r\nremained for many years the standard work on the subject. This was\r\nfollowed in 1860 by _Outlines of British Mycology_, a book profusely\r\nillustrated with coloured plates, and intended more especially for the\r\nbeginner in the study of Mycology.\r\n\r\nJust over 400 separate papers dealing with fungi are listed under\r\nBerkeley's name alone, in addition to numerous others, where he worked\r\nin collaboration with C. E. Broome, Dr M. C. Cooke, Rev. M. A. Curtis,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plant Pathology._\r\n\r\nAt the present day Berkeley is best known as a systematist, which of\r\nitself alone is sufficient to retain his name for all time in the\r\nfront rank of mycologists, but when the history of Plant Pathology is\r\nelaborated, Berkeley's name will undoubtedly stand out more prominently\r\nthan that of any other individual. In fact, it is not saying too much\r\nto pronounce Berkeley as the originator and founder of Plant Pathology.\r\nHe was not the first to investigate plant diseases caused by fungi,\r\nbut he was undoubtedly the first to recognise the significance of the\r\nsubject, and its great importance from an economic standpoint. His\r\ninvestigation of the potato murrain, written in 1846, cleared the air\r\nof all kinds of wild theories as to its origin, and showed it to be\r\nundoubtedly caused by the fungus now known as _Phytophthora infestans_,\r\nwhose life-history he carefully worked out. Then followed a similar\r\ninvestigation of the vine-mildew, and a series of researches on\r\ndiseases of plants published in the _Gardeners' Chronicle_ dating from\r\n1854 to 1880. It was in these numerous communications that the science\r\nof Plant Pathology was firmly established and propounded. The article\r\n\"On the Diseases of Plants\" was contributed to the _Cyclopaedia of\r\nAgriculture_ by Berkeley.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 he unconditionally presented his mycological herbarium to Kew.\r\nThis collection contained 10,000 species, of which 5000 were types of\r\nBerkeley's own species, in addition to numerous co-types from Montagne,\r\nSchweinitz, Fries, Cooke and other contemporaneous mycologists. Hence\r\nKew is, and must for ever remain, the Mecca of mycologists from all\r\nparts of the world.\r\n\r\nBerkeley was a man of great refinement, and an excellent classical\r\nscholar. His tall commanding figure and grand head with flowing white\r\nhair, as I knew him late in life, could not fail to arrest attention.\r\nUnobtrusive and by no means ambitious, and too enthusiastic to be\r\nself-seeking, Berkeley was tardily promoted to the Honorary Fellowship\r\nof his College, and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society at the age of\r\n76. In 1876 a Civil List Pension of _£_100 per annum was awarded, for\r\nhis services to botany with especial reference to his investigations on\r\nthe diseases of plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate XIX_ JOSEPH HENRY GILBERT]\r\n\r\nSIR JOSEPH HENRY GILBERT\r\n\r\n1817-1901\r\n\r\nBY W. B. BOTTOMLEY\r\n\r\n  Early training in Chemistry--his meeting with Lawes--official\r\n  distinctions--the Lawes-Gilbert combination--the Rothamsted\r\n  Reports--Liebig's 'mineral theory'--the relation to\r\n  nitrogen--Leguminous plants--Hellriegel and others--confirmation of\r\n  their results--nitrification--feeding of stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Henry Gilbert was born at Hull on August 1, 1817. He was a\r\nson of the manse being the second son of the Rev. Joseph Gilbert, a\r\nCongregational Minister. His mother was one of the gifted daughters of\r\nthe Rev. Isaac Taylor of Ongar, and a well-known writer of hymns and\r\nsongs for children. Whilst at school young Gilbert had the misfortune\r\nto meet with a gunshot accident which deprived him of the use of one\r\neye, a mishap which for a time threatened to mar his future career,\r\nbut his own inherent determination and the home-training of the manse\r\nenabled him to overcome the disadvantage of defective eye-sight, and\r\ntriumph over physical disability.\r\n\r\nFrom school he went to Glasgow University and studied chemistry under\r\nProfessor Thomas Thomson, then to University College, London, where\r\nhe attended the classes of Professor Graham and others, and worked\r\nin the laboratory of Professor Todd Thomson. Here it was, in Dr\r\nThomson's laboratory, that he first met Mr J. B. Lawes, with whom he\r\nwas afterwards so intimately associated. He then proceeded to Giessen\r\nfor a short time, studying under Liebig and taking his degree of Doctor\r\nof Philosophy in 1840. Returning to London, he worked at University\r\nCollege, acting as laboratory assistant to Professor Thomson, and\r\nbecame a Fellow of the Chemical Society on May 18, 1841, when the\r\nSociety was barely three months old. He then left London to take up\r\ncalico printing and dyeing in the neighbourhood of Manchester, but\r\nreturned south in 1843, at the invitation of Mr Lawes, to assist in the\r\nagricultural investigations at Rothamsted, Herts.\r\n\r\nMr John Lawes had begun experiments in 1837 on growing plants in pots\r\nwith various manures. He discovered the fact that mineral phosphates\r\nwhen treated with sulphuric acid yielded a most effective manure.\r\nTaking out his patent for the production of superphosphates in 1842,\r\nLawes soon found himself busy with the establishment of a successful\r\nbusiness. Not wishing to give up the agricultural investigations\r\nwhich he had commenced in the fields of Rothamsted he decided to\r\nobtain scientific assistance, and remembering the young chemist he had\r\nmet in Dr Thomson's laboratory, Gilbert was invited in June 1843 to\r\nsuperintend the Rothamsted experiments. Thus began that partnership in\r\ninvestigation which has yielded such a rich harvest of results, and an\r\nassociation with Rothamsted which lasted for fifty-eight years.\r\n\r\nGilbert was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1860, and received\r\na Royal Medal in 1867. He was President of the Chemical Section of the\r\nBritish Association in 1880, and President of the Chemical Society,\r\n1882-3. In 1884 he was appointed Sibthorpian Professor of Rural Economy\r\nat Oxford, and held the chair until 1890. He was a member of various\r\nforeign academies and societies, and was the recipient of honorary\r\ndegrees from several home universities, becoming LL.D. of Glasgow\r\n(1883), M.A. of Oxford (1884), LL.D. of Edinburgh (1890), and Sc.D.\r\nof Cambridge (1894). In 1893 on the occasion of the jubilee of the\r\nRothamsted experiments he received the honour of knighthood.\r\n\r\nThe character and scope of Gilbert's life-work was well described by\r\nProf. Dewar at a special meeting of the Chemical Society in 1898, when\r\nhe said, \"The work of Gilbert, as we know, was early differentiated\r\ninto that most complex and mysterious study, the study of organic life.\r\nFor the last fifty years he has devoted his attention to the physiology\r\nof plant life in every phase of its development. With a skill that has\r\nbeen unprecedented, he has recorded from year to year the variations\r\nin the growth of every kind of nutritious plant. He has examined into\r\nthe meteorological conditions, the variations of climate, of soil,\r\nand of mineral agents, of drainage, and of every conceivable thing\r\naffecting the production and development of plant growth. These memoirs\r\nare admitted throughout the world to be unique in their importance.\r\nWherever the chemist or the physiologist, the statistician or the\r\neconomist has to deal with these problems, he must turn to the results\r\nof the Rothamsted experiments in order to understand the position of\r\nthe science of our time. These results will be for ever memorable;\r\nthey are unique and characteristic of the indomitable perseverance and\r\nenergy of our venerated President, Sir Henry Gilbert.\"\r\n\r\nThe close association of Lawes and Gilbert in the Rothamsted\r\nexperiments makes it almost impossible to separate the work of the two\r\nmen. The majority of the 132 papers issued from Rothamsted between\r\n1843 and 1901 appeared under the joint names of Lawes and Gilbert, and\r\nit would be as difficult as it is undesirable to attempt an analysis\r\nof this partnership. It was essentially a partnership devoid of any\r\njealousy, and actuated by a feeling of mutual regard and esteem.\r\nThere never was a question as to the \"predominant partner.\" The two\r\nworkers formed an unique combination, each supplying some deficiency\r\nin the other. Lawes possessed the originating mind and had a thorough\r\nknowledge of the facts and needs of practical agriculture; Gilbert was\r\nthe exact scientist, the man of detail and method. Dr J. A. Voelcker,\r\nwho speaks of Gilbert as his life-long friend and teacher, says, \"The\r\npartnership and collaboration of 'Lawes and Gilbert' represented an\r\nexcellent embodiment of the motto 'Practice with Science.' Lawes was\r\nessentially the practical agriculturist--quick to see and grasp what\r\nthe farmer wanted, and to become the interpreter to him. He was the\r\nman to whom the practical farmer turned, the one to write a brisk\r\narticle on some subject of agricultural practice or economy, to answer\r\na practical question, or to solve some knotty problem. Lawes was the\r\nmore versatile of the two, the more inclined to introduce changes in\r\nand modifications of the original plan; and he has been known to say,\r\njokingly, that if he had been left to have his own way, he would have\r\nploughed up many of his experimental plots before they had yielded the\r\nfull results, which continuance on the old lines alone brought out.\r\nGilbert, on the other hand, was possessed of indomitable perseverance,\r\ncombined with extreme patience and careful watching of results. His was\r\nthe power of forecasting, as it were, what might, in the end, lead to\r\nuseful results. With the determination to carry out an experiment to\r\nthe very close he united scrupulous accuracy and attention to detail.\r\nGilbert, it may be said, was not so much the man for the farmer, but\r\nfor the scientist, and he it was who gave scientific expression to\r\nthe work at Rothamsted, and who established field experiments on a\r\nscientific basis in this country.\"\r\n\r\nTo describe in detail Gilbert's work it would be necessary to write an\r\naccount of the Rothamsted experiments, a task beyond our present limits\r\nseeing that the collected reports occupy nine volumes.\r\n\r\nThe last published \"Rothamsted Memoranda\" gives a list of 132 papers.\r\nThey are divided into two series, one relating to plants, the other to\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nSeries I. deals with \"Reports of Field Experiments, Experiments on\r\nVegetation, &c., published 1847-1900 inclusive,\" and contains 101\r\npapers. These reports on plants are concerned chiefly with the results\r\nobtained by growing some of the most important crops of rotation\r\nseparately, year after year, for many years in succession, on the same\r\nland without manure, with farm-yard manure, and with various chemical\r\nmanures, the same description of manure being, as a rule, applied year\r\nafter year on the same plot.\r\n\r\nAmongst the numerous field experiments conducted on these lines one of\r\nthe most interesting is the field known as Broadbalk field, in which\r\nwheat has been grown continuously for over 60 years. The results show\r\nthat wheat can be grown for many years in succession on ordinary arable\r\nland if suitable manure be provided and the land be kept clean. Even\r\nwithout manure of any kind the average produce for 46 years--1852 to\r\n1897--was nearly 13 bushels per acre, about the average yield per\r\nacre of the wheat lands of the world. On this field it was found that\r\nmineral manures alone gave very little increase, whilst nitrogenous\r\nmanures alone gave a much greater increase than mineral manures alone,\r\nbut the mixture of the two gave much more than either alone. It is\r\nestimated that the reduction in yield, due to exhaustion, of the\r\nunmanured plot over 40 years--1852 to 1891--was, provided it had been\r\nuniform throughout, equivalent to a decline of one-sixth of a bushel\r\nper acre. It is related that a visitor from America, when being shown\r\nover the Broadbalk field, said to Sir John Lawes, \"Americans have\r\nlearnt more from this field than from any other agricultural experiment\r\nin the world.\"\r\n\r\nAnother set of field experiments of exceptional interest is that\r\nrelating to the \"Mixed Herbage of Permanent Grass Land.\" The land was\r\ndivided into twenty plots. Two plots have received no manure from\r\nthe commencement of the experiment, two have received a dressing of\r\nfarm-yard manure each year, whilst the remainder have each received a\r\ndifferent kind of artificial or chemical manure, the same kind being\r\napplied year after year on the same plot, except in a few special\r\ncases. Repeated analyses have shown how greatly both the botanical\r\nconstitution and the chemical composition of the mixed herbage varied\r\naccording to the kind of manure applied.\r\n\r\nThe results of these experiments were given under three\r\nheadings--agricultural, botanical and chemical, and show in an\r\nexceptional manner the care of detail to which every investigation\r\nwas subjected by Gilbert. Some people have thought that this minute\r\nattention to detail was carried to excess by Gilbert, and resulted\r\nin a bewildering multiplication of numerical statements and figures.\r\nOne can, however, but admire his love of accuracy and absolute\r\nconscientiousness, and if his caution appeared at times to be carried\r\nto an extreme, the result has been to make \"the Rothamsted experiments\r\na standard for reference, and an example wherever agricultural research\r\nis attempted.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most important results of the Rothamsted investigations has\r\nbeen the replacing of the \"mineral theory\" of Liebig by the \"nitrogen\r\ntheory\" of Lawes and Gilbert. Liebig held the view that each crop\r\nrequires certain mineral elements from the soil, and that crops will\r\nnot flourish where the appropriate elements are lacking. Every soil\r\ncontains some element in the minimum. Whatever element this minimum may\r\nbe it determines the abundance and continuity of the crop. The only\r\nfertiliser which acts favourably is that which supplies a deficiency of\r\none or more of the food elements in the soil. The atmosphere, according\r\nto Liebig, supplies in sufficient quantity both the carbon and nitrogen\r\nrequired by crops, and the function of manure is to supply the ash\r\nconstituents of the soil. The exhaustion of soils is to be ascribed to\r\ntheir decreased content of mineral ingredients rather than to decrease\r\nin nitrogen.\r\n\r\nWhen careful study of the composition of the atmosphere proved that the\r\namount of ammonia brought down to the earth by rain scarcely exceeds a\r\nfew pounds per acre annually, Liebig maintained that plants are capable\r\nof directly absorbing ammonia by means of their leaves. He pointed out\r\nthat the beneficial effects of nitrogenous manures are most apparent in\r\nthe case of cereal crops with a comparatively short vegetation period,\r\nand least apparent in the case of leafy crops with a long vegetation\r\nperiod. The long vegetation period of crops like clover allowed time\r\nfor the utilisation of the ammonia of the air and no artificial supply\r\nwas necessary. On the other hand, crops with a short vegetation period\r\nhad a limited time for accumulating ammonia from the air, and responded\r\nreadily to applications of nitrogenous manures.\r\n\r\nGilbert, early in his work at Rothamsted, noticed that the results of\r\nhis field experiments were at variance with this \"mineral theory,\"\r\nas it was called, of Liebig, and soon found himself involved in\r\na controversy with the great German chemist which was not always\r\nfree from bitterness. He found that the nitrogen compounds of the\r\natmosphere were sufficient only for a very meagre vegetation. Cereals\r\ntreated with ammonium salts and other nitrogenous manures showed a far\r\ngreater increase of produce than when phosphates, potash or other ash\r\nconstituents only were supplied. \"As more nitrogen was assimilated\r\na greater amount of the fixed bases were found in the ash, and he\r\nconsidered that the function of the fixed bases was to act as carriers\r\nof nitric acid. These bases--potash, soda, lime and magnesia, were not\r\nmutually replaceable, but the predominance of one or the other affected\r\nthe produce. Luxuriance of growth was associated with the amount\r\nof nitrogen available and assimilated, and in the presence of this\r\nsufficiency of nitrogen the formation of carbohydrates depended on the\r\namount of potash available.\" The possibility that the free nitrogen of\r\nthe air might supply the nitrogenous needs of plants was disproved by\r\ngrowing plants in calcined soil and removing all traces of ammonia from\r\nthe air before it was admitted into the glass case in which the plants\r\nwere growing. Determinations were made of the nitrogen in the seed and\r\nsoil at the beginning of the experiments, and in the plants and soil at\r\ntheir conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe work on the assimilation of nitrogen by plants extended over\r\nthree years and was made the subject of a communication to the Royal\r\nSociety in 1861. The paper, entitled, \"The Sources of the Nitrogen\r\nof Vegetation; with special reference to the question whether Plants\r\nassimilate free or combined Nitrogen,\" occupies 144 pages of the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_, and is a brilliant example of the\r\nscrupulous accuracy and attention to detail which characterised all\r\nGilbert's work. It is divided into two parts--I. \"The General History\r\nand Statement of the question.\"--II. \"The Experimental Results obtained\r\nat Rothamsted during the years 1857, 1858 and 1859.\" The authors\r\nstate in the summary of conclusions that \"in our experiments with\r\ngraminaceous plants, grown both with and without a supply of combined\r\nnitrogen beyond that contained in the seed sown, in which there was\r\ngreat variation in the amount of combined nitrogen involved and a wide\r\nrange in the conditions, character and amount of growth, we have in\r\nno case found any evidence of an assimilation of free or uncombined\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\n\"In our experiments with leguminous plants the growth was less\r\nsatisfactory, and the range of conditions possibly favourable for the\r\nassimilation of free nitrogen was, therefore, more limited. But the\r\nresults recorded with these plants, so far as they go, do not indicate\r\nany assimilation of free nitrogen. Since, however, in practice\r\nleguminous crops assimilate from some source so very much more nitrogen\r\nthan graminaceous ones under ostensibly equal circumstances of supply\r\nof combined nitrogen, it is desirable that the evidence of further\r\nexperiments with these plants under conditions of more healthy growth\r\nshould be obtained.\"\r\n\r\nAs long as Gilbert's investigations were confined to non-leguminous\r\nplants and to leguminous plants grown in calcined soil the \"nitrogen\r\ntheory\" was triumphant. When, however, leguminous plants were grown\r\nin uncalcined soil or in the open the results were uncertain, and in\r\nmany cases the manures supplying ash constituents alone proved the\r\nmost effective. The elucidation of these uncertain results has been a\r\ntedious problem, and has taken many years of patient investigation, but\r\ngradually the evidence accumulated which led to its solution.\r\n\r\nField and pot experiments in Germany, France, England and the\r\nUnited States in the late seventies and early eighties furnished\r\nabundant proof that under certain conditions leguminous plants do\r\nobtain nitrogen from the atmosphere, and gradually, from the work of\r\nRautenberg, Frank and others, the idea was evolving that fungi or\r\nmicro-organisms play some important part in the process.\r\n\r\nGilbert, however, would not listen to any such heresy, as he considered\r\nthat the question of the assimilation of the free nitrogen of the air\r\nby plants had been finally settled by the experiments of 1857-60.\r\nIt was therefore a most happy chance that Gilbert was present at\r\nthe scientific congress in Berlin in 1886 when Hellriegel described\r\nhis experiments on leguminous plants, showing that the formation of\r\nnodules on these plants was associated with the fixation of atmospheric\r\nnitrogen. In commenting subsequently on these experiments, Gilbert\r\nsaid, \"It must be admitted that Hellriegel's results, taken together\r\nwith those of Berthelot and others, do suggest the possibility that,\r\nalthough the higher plants may not possess the power of directly\r\nfixing the free nitrogen of the air, lower organisms, which abound\r\nwithin the soil, may have that power, and may thus bring free nitrogen\r\ninto a state of combination within the soil in which it is available\r\nto the higher plants--at any rate to members of the Papilionaceous\r\nfamily. At the same time, it will be granted that further confirmation\r\nis essential before such a conclusion can be accepted as fully\r\nestablished.\"\r\n\r\nThis comment reveals the essential conservatism of Gilbert's mind, but\r\nthe true greatness of the man is seen when we find him, at the age of\r\nseventy, repeating the experiments of Hellriegel and Wilfarth, and\r\nhimself supplying the confirmation of their results which he considered\r\nessential.\r\n\r\nThe results of these experiments, contributed to the Royal Society in\r\n1887, 1889, and 1890, fully confirmed the theory that leguminous plants\r\nare able to assimilate the free nitrogen of the air by means of the\r\nmicro-organisms contained in their root nodules, and also explained the\r\nfailure in the 1857-60 experiments to demonstrate nitrogen fixation\r\nby leguminous plants owing to the use of calcined soil by which the\r\ninoculating organisms present in the soil were destroyed.\r\n\r\nGilbert's investigations from 1871-75 showing that the drainage waters\r\nfrom the experimental fields of Rothamsted contained more nitrates\r\nas the amount of ammonium salts applied to the soil increased, have\r\nbeen quoted by some writers as being the basis of the modern theory of\r\nnitrification. It must be remembered that Gilbert was at first actively\r\nhostile to the bacterial theory of nitrification, and the credit and\r\nhonour of the work done at Rothamsted on the nitrifying organisms\r\nbelongs entirely to Warington.\r\n\r\nA few words must suffice for an account of the series of Rothamsted\r\nexperiments on animals. Series II deals with \"Reports of experiments\r\non the feeding of animals, sewage utilisation, &c. Published 1841-1895\r\ninclusive,\" and contains 31 papers. Among the points investigated may\r\nbe mentioned--the composition of foods in relation to respiration and\r\nthe feeding of animals; experiments on the feeding of sheep and the\r\nfattening of oxen; some points in connection with animal nutrition; the\r\nfeeding of animals for the production of meat, milk and manure.\r\n\r\nThe work on the part played by carbohydrates in the formation of animal\r\nfat led to a keen controversy with foreign investigators. Lawes and\r\nGilbert had satisfied themselves by their experiments on pigs that fat\r\nwas undoubtedly produced from carbohydrates. The German physiologists\r\ndoubted this, and for some time there was a wordy warfare between the\r\nrival camps. Gradually the experimental evidence for the formation\r\nof fats from carbohydrates became overwhelming, and once again the\r\nRothamsted position was vindicated.\r\n\r\nGilbert maintained throughout his life a close connection with foreign\r\nworkers, and his holidays were frequently employed in visiting\r\ninstitutions and attending scientific meetings on the Continent. He\r\nmade three visits to the United States and Canada and delivered several\r\nlectures there.\r\n\r\nAs he passed into old age his powers seemed to suffer little\r\ndiminution, and his appearance at the age of eighty showed little\r\nindication of physical weakness. The death of Sir John Lawes in August\r\n1900 was a severe blow to him, and soon afterwards his energies began\r\nto fail. He had a severe illness whilst away in Scotland in the autumn\r\nof 1901, but he recovered sufficiently to be able to return to his work\r\nfor a short time. With the indomitable tenacity which had characterised\r\nhim throughout life he continued actively at work for a few more weeks,\r\neventually succumbing on December 23rd, 1901, in his eighty-fifth year.\r\n\r\nThanks are due to Dr J.

SCOTT\r\n\r\n  Early exponents of Fossil Botany--Witham of Lartington--Edward\r\n  William Binney--William Crawford Williamson--early\r\n  influences--first contribution to science--studies medicine--work\r\n  on Foraminifera--appointed Professor at Manchester--successful\r\n  popular lecturer--his influence in Natural History--investigation\r\n  of the Carboniferous Flora--controversy with French\r\n  palaeo-botanists--the magnitude of his output--defects in his\r\n  work--later work at Kew--personal traits.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last forty years the study of fossil plants has come to be\r\na specially vigorous and characteristic branch of British botany. The\r\nproper subject of my lecture is Williamson, the man to whom above all\r\nothers the present strong position of the subject is due. But \"there\r\nwere brave men before Agamemnon,\" and there are two of the older\r\nmasters, Witham and Binney, whom I cannot wholly pass over. I ought\r\nreally to include others, and notably Sir Joseph Hooker, to whom we owe\r\nour first clear understanding of _Stigmaria_ and of _Lepidostrobus_,\r\nbut this course does not extend to those who, like Sir Joseph, are\r\nstill living among us and still in active work[119].\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Mr Philip Witham, a member of the family, for some\r\ninformation about Henry Witham, of Lartington, the first Englishman to\r\ninvestigate the internal structure of fossil plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate XX_ HENRY WITHAM OF LARTINGTON]\r\n\r\nHenry Witham was, by birth, not a Witham, but a Silvertop, having been\r\nthe second son of John Silvertop of Minster Acres, Northumberland. As\r\nHenry Silvertop he came in for the Lartington property. He was born in\r\n1779 and married Miss Eliza Witham, niece and co-heiress of William\r\nWitham of Cliffe, Yorkshire, when he took the name and arms of Witham.\r\n\r\nThe method of cutting thin sections of rocks and fossils had just\r\nbeen invented by Nicol, and this gave Witham the opportunity for his\r\ninvestigations. His papers are illustrated by the botanist McGillivray,\r\nto whom he may have owed some further assistance. Indeed he made little\r\npretension to botanical knowledge, but the opinions which he expresses\r\nstrike one as remarkably sensible, and he must have been a man of sound\r\njudgment, at least in scientific affairs.\r\n\r\nWitham was the first investigator of that most famous of fossils,\r\n_Lepidodendron Harcourtii_; of the Craigleith tree (now _Pitys\r\nWithami_), of the Lennel Braes trees (_Pitys antiqua_ and _P.\r\nprimaeva_), of the Wideopen tree (_Pinites_, now _Cordaites\r\nBrandlingi_) and of _Anabathra pulcherrima_. It is curious to notice\r\nthat the Craigleith tree, a manifest Gymnosperm, was at first (1829)\r\nregarded even by the great Brongniart as a Monocotyledon, while others\r\nimagined it to be a Lycopod. Witham, however, soon set this right. He\r\nalways speaks with great respect of Brongniart, then just becoming the\r\nrecognised leader of fossil botany. The following passage from Witham's\r\nmemoir on the vegetable fossils found at Lennel Braes, near Coldstream,\r\nis of interest.\r\n\r\n\"Now, according to that gentleman's [Brongniart's] opinion, out of six\r\nclasses ... only two existed at that period [Carboniferous], namely the\r\nVascular Cryptogamic plants, comprehending the Filices, Equisetaceae\r\nand Lycopodeae, and the Monocotyledons, containing a small number of\r\nplants which appear to resemble the Palms and arborescent Liliaceae.\r\nThe existence, therefore, of so extensive a deposit of Dicotyledonous\r\nplants, at this early period of the earth's vegetation, appears to\r\ndemand the attention of the naturalist.\"\r\n\r\nBrongniart's \"Monocotyledons\" were no doubt Cordaiteae. Witham, we see,\r\nset the great man right as regards the antiquity of Dicotyledons, in\r\nwhich, of course, Gymnosperms were then included.\r\n\r\nWitham's earlier papers were embodied in his book: _The Internal\r\nStructure of Fossil Vegetables found in the Carboniferous and Oolitic\r\ndeposits of Great Britain, described and illustrated_, 1833. It is\r\ndedicated to William Hutton, author, with Lindley, of the _Fossil\r\nFlora_ of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nA passage from the dedication shows that Witham took his work\r\nseriously--\"To lend my aid in bringing from their obscure repositories\r\nthe ancient records of a former state of things, with the view of\r\ndisclosing the early and mysterious operations of the Great Author of\r\nall created things, will ever be to me a source of unalloyed pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nWitham thus fully realised the important significance of the work\r\non which he was engaged. He must have been an interesting person of\r\na somewhat complex character, and I wish we could know more about\r\nhim. He died on Nov. 28th, 1844. Like all his family, he was a Roman\r\nCatholic[120].\r\n\r\nWitham's localities on the Tweed remained practically unvisited until\r\nMr Kidston re-explored them eight or nine years ago, with brilliant\r\nsuccess--the results, however, are still unpublished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEdward William Binney, the first investigator of the Lancashire\r\ncoal-balls, was born at Morton in Nottinghamshire in 1812, and was thus\r\nonly four years senior to Williamson. He settled in Manchester in 1836,\r\nand practised as a solicitor. He early showed scientific tastes; the\r\nManchester Geological Society was started, chiefly by his influence,\r\nin October 1838. He was concerned in the discovery of the famous St\r\nHelen's trees, which first proved the connection between _Sigillaria_\r\nand _Stigmaria_. \"Binney completed the proof that all coal-seams rest\r\non old soils which are constituted entirely of vegetable matter;\r\nthis was the seat-stone of a seam of coal\" (Robert Hunt). He gave\r\nup the practice of Law, and, devoting himself to science, became a\r\nleading authority on northern geology, and rendered important aid to\r\nthe Geological Survey by his long experience of the coal-fields of\r\nLancashire and Cheshire. He assisted in the discovery of the Torbane\r\nHill mineral or Boghead Cannel, a deposit once notorious as a subject\r\nof litigation, and more recently as a bone of scientific contention.\r\nBinney died on December 19, 1881. Etheridge said of him: \"He was a man\r\nof the highest honour and remarkably outspoken; his sturdiness and\r\nstrength of character being rarely equalled.\"\r\n\r\nBinney was the discoverer of some now famous fossils, notably\r\n_Dadoxylon_ (now _Lyginodendron_) _oldhamium_, and _Stauropteris\r\noldhamia_. His best known work is the monograph, _Observations on\r\nthe Structure of Fossil Plants_, in four parts, published for the\r\nPalaeontographical Society, from 1868 to 1875. Thus his work on\r\ncoal-plants overlapped that of Williamson.\r\n\r\nThe first part is on _Calamites_ and _Calamodendron_--the names are\r\nused in the old sense, for Binney kept up Brongniart's distinction,\r\nthough apparently not convinced of its validity. In this memoir\r\nhe described the \"cone of _Calamodendron commune_,\" now known as\r\n_Calamostachys Binneyana_.\r\n\r\nPart II, on _Lepidostrobus_ and some allied cones, is remarkable for\r\nthe demonstration of heterospory in several species.\r\n\r\nPart III, on _Lepidodendron_, deals partly with stems referred to _L.\r\nHarcourtii_, but now separated as _L. fuliginosum_. He also describes\r\nthe structure of a _Halonia_ and is led to the conclusion that it is\r\nthe root of _Lepidodendron_. This view has not found favour, but our\r\nold ideas about _Ulodendron_ and _Halonia_ have been so upset of late,\r\nthat everything seems possible!\r\n\r\nPart IV is on _Sigillaria_ and _Stigmaria_, the \"_Sigillaria_\"\r\ndescribed being _S. vascularis_, since identified with _Lepidodendron\r\nselaginoides_, or _L. vasculare_, if we maintain Binney's specific name.\r\n\r\nBinney was not a great theoriser. His object was rather to provide\r\nmaterial for the botanists, he being essentially a geologist. This he\r\ndid admirably, for his monograph is illustrated by magnificent drawings\r\nfrom the hand of Fitch, the famous botanical artist.\r\n\r\nBinney stood more under the influence of Brongniart than did his\r\nsuccessor Williamson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate XXI_ WILLIAM CRAWFORD WILLIAMSON (1876)]\r\n\r\nI now go on to my principal subject. Williamson's father, John\r\nWilliamson, originally a gardener, was well known for his researches\r\non the Natural History of the Yorkshire coast, and was for 27 years\r\ncurator of the Scarborough Museum. Previously to that, John Williamson\r\nkept a private museum of his own, and it was in the room next to this\r\nthat William Crawford Williamson was born on November 24, 1816. John\r\nWilliamson's cousin, William Bean, was also an active local naturalist,\r\nknown especially for his work on the Yorkshire Fossil Flora; the genus\r\n_Beania_ is named after him.\r\n\r\nOur Williamson's mother, born Elizabeth Crawford, was the eldest of 13\r\nchildren of a Scarborough jeweller and lapidary. Young Williamson used\r\nto spend much time in the Crawford's workshop, watching them cutting\r\nand working with the diamond the agates from the gravels of the coast.\r\n\"A youthful training,\" he says, \"which became of the utmost value to me\r\nmore than a third of a century later, when scientific research required\r\nme to devote much of my own time to similar work[121].\"\r\n\r\nIn 1826 the famous William Smith and his wife established themselves in\r\nthe Williamson's house, and stayed there for two years. Williamson's\r\nearly recollections of the \"Father of English Geology\" must have been\r\ninspiring. His father was also a friend and correspondent of Sir\r\nRoderick Murchison.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Phillips' classic volume, _Illustrations of the\r\nGeology of Yorkshire_, in 1829, gave young Williamson his first\r\nintroduction to true scientific work. His father at once set to work\r\nto name from this book the fossils he collected, and his son was\r\ncalled in to help. \"My evenings throughout a long winter were devoted\r\nto the detested labour of naming these miserable stones.\"--\"Pursuing\r\nthis uncongenial task gave me in my 13th year a thorough practical\r\nfamiliarity with the palaeontological treasures of Eastern Yorkshire.\r\nThis early acquisition happily moulded the entire course of my future\r\nlife[122].\"\r\n\r\nThose were not the days of the half-educated. Young Williamson, in\r\naddition to his special scientific training, had the advantage of a\r\nclassical education, at schools both in England and France. The French\r\npart of his education was not altogether a success, for most of the\r\nboys at the school were English.\r\n\r\nPassing through London on his return he had breakfast with Sir Roderick\r\nMurchison, who took him to the Geological Society. This was in March\r\n1832, when he was little more than 15. Certainly his entrance into\r\nthe scientific world was made easy for him. Would it be made equally\r\neasy now for a boy in a similar position? In the same year, 1832,\r\nWilliamson was articled to Mr Thomas Weddell, a medical practitioner at\r\nScarborough. While with him, he continued to pursue Natural History as\r\na recreation--bird-collecting for example, and also botany. He writes,\r\n\"I was then forming a collection of the plants of Eastern Yorkshire, as\r\nwell as trying to master the natural classification, which was already\r\nbeginning to supplant the Linnean method, so long the one universally\r\nadopted[123].\"\r\n\r\nA memoir on the rare birds of Yorkshire was communicated to the\r\nZoological Society of London--an early work though not quite the\r\nearliest. While with Mr Weddell, Williamson contributed a number of\r\ndescriptions and drawings of oolitic plants to Lindley and Hutton's\r\n_Fossil Flora_. He tells us how the drawings had to be made in the\r\nevenings on Mr Weddell's kitchen table. The plants he illustrated had\r\nfor the most part been collected by his father and John Bean in a small\r\nestuarine deposit at Gristhorpe Bay. More than 30 species were thus\r\nrecorded by him.\r\n\r\nHe also made diagrams to illustrate some lectures on Vegetable\r\nPhysiology given by Mr Weddell at the Mechanics' Institution. It is\r\nrather surprising to find that such a course was given in a country\r\ntown during the early 'thirties. Probably the learning displayed was\r\nnot very deep, for Mrs Marcet's _Conversations_ seem to have been the\r\nchief authority.\r\n\r\nIn 1834-36 Williamson published important papers, determining\r\ngeological zones, from the Lias to the Cornbrash, by means of their\r\nfossils; subsequently he extended his zoning work up to the Oxford Clay.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Gristhorpe tumulus in July 1834, when a skeleton,\r\nof the Bronze Age, was found in a coffin fashioned out of the trunk\r\nof an oak-tree, gave occasion to Williamson's one contribution to\r\narchaeology. His memoir was reprinted in the _Literary Gazette_\r\nfor October 18, 1834 (still before he was 18). This was through Dr\r\nBuckland's influence; in a letter to Williamson he said, \"I am happy to\r\nhave been instrumental in bringing before the public a name to which I\r\nlook forward as likely to figure in the annals of British Science.\" A\r\nsecond and third edition of this paper were called for.\r\n\r\nIn September 1835 Williamson was appointed curator of the Museum of the\r\nManchester Natural History Society, and so began his long connection\r\nwith the great northern town, lasting down to 1892. In those days the\r\ninterest in the vigorous young science of geology was extraordinarily\r\nkeen, and there was great activity, especially among the naturalists\r\nof the North, many of whom were working men. Williamson, about 1838,\r\ngave a course of lectures on geology at various northern towns,\r\nand thus raised funds for his removal to London, to continue his\r\nmedical studies. It is interesting to find that Williamson, while at\r\nManchester, helped to nurse John Dalton in his last illness.\r\n\r\nWhile curator at Manchester, Williamson saw the rise of Binney as a\r\ngeologist.\r\n\r\nHis remarks on the local study of botany at that time are interesting.\r\n\"The botanical interests of the district were chiefly in the hands of\r\nthe operative community. The hills between Lancashire and Yorkshire\r\nswarmed with botanical and floricultural societies, who met on Sundays,\r\nthe only day when it was possible to do so[124].\" Some of these men\r\nmust have had an excellent education, as shown by the good English they\r\nwrote, as for example Richard Buxton, a poor working man, author of a\r\nstandard _Botanical Guide_. The society to which Buxton belonged had,\r\nin 1849, existed for nearly a century. It may be doubted whether an\r\nequal enthusiasm for science still prevails in that or in any part of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn September 1840 Williamson went to London to complete his medical\r\ntraining, and entered University College, making the acquaintance of\r\nProf. Lindley, who had for so long known him only as a correspondent\r\nand collaborator.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards he was offered the post of naturalist to the Niger\r\nexpedition, which he refused, and, as it turned out fortunately, for\r\nthe journey proved disastrous. Stanger, of _Stangeria_ fame, took his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, having then returned to Manchester and started in practice,\r\nWilliamson made his first attempt at microscopic work, having become\r\ninterested in the Foraminifera of the Chalk. He also began to examine\r\nConfervae, Diatoms and Desmids, finding perhaps, as others have done,\r\nthat the Fresh-water Algae give the best introduction to microscopic\r\nbiology.\r\n\r\nThe work on Foraminifera became one of the most important in\r\nWilliamson's career. In 1845 he wrote his valuable paper on microscopic\r\norganisms in the mud of the Levant. His work in this field culminated\r\nin his monograph of Foraminifera, issued by the Ray Society in 1857.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Williamson was appointed Professor of Natural History, which\r\nincluded Zoology, Botany and Geology, at the new Owens College,\r\nManchester. He tells us, \"The botanical portion of my work was that\r\nfor which I was least prepared\"--\"of the German language I was utterly\r\nignorant[125].\" The almost insuperable difficulties of a triple\r\nProfessorship were at first met by spreading the complete course over\r\ntwo years, a sensible plan which was rendered impracticable by the more\r\nrigid requirements of examinations. It was not, however, till 1872 that\r\na division of the duties of the chair took place; Williamson was then\r\nrelieved of the geological teaching by the appointment of Prof. Boyd\r\nDawkins; in 1880 the zoology was taken over by the late Prof. Milnes\r\nMarshall, Williamson thus retaining the very subject, botany, with\r\nwhich he had originally been the least familiar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXII\r\n\r\nVascular system of stem of _Lepidodendron selaginoides_ in transverse\r\nsection. _Drawn by Williamson_]\r\n\r\nIn addition to his peculiarly arduous duties as Professor, Williamson\r\nwas a great populariser of science. He was one of the first two members\r\nof the Owens' staff to start, in 1854, evening classes for working\r\nmen. He gave numerous scientific lectures at the Royal Institution in\r\nLondon and elsewhere, his greatest work in this field being his\r\nlectures for the Gilchrist Trustees. He mentions that from 1874 to 1880\r\nhe delivered 158 of these lectures in 61 towns, and he continued this\r\nwork with equal activity for another 10 years. He was a vigorous and\r\neffective lecturer, who always interested his audience; he illustrated\r\nhis lectures by bold diagrams, drawn by his own hand. In order to form\r\nany idea of Williamson's many-sided activity it must be remembered\r\nthat he was all the time engaged in active medical practice, both\r\ngeneral and special, for he was well known as an aurist. Yet he always\r\nfound time for fruitful original research, often of the most laborious\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nProf. Judd says, in a letter written to me in February 1911:\r\n\r\n\"I have often been struck by the fact that Williamson, appointed to an\r\nimpossible Professorship of Zoology, Botany and Geology, managed to\r\ninitiate _great movements_ in connection with _each of these sciences_.\r\n\r\n\"In Geology he was clearly the pioneer in the subdivision of formations\r\ninto zones each characterised by an assemblage of fossils--Ammonites\r\nplaying the most important part.... But Williamson did another great\r\nservice to Geology.... Sorby visited Williamson at Manchester and\r\nlearned the art of making sections which he applied with such success\r\nto the study of igneous and other rocks, becoming the 'Father of\r\nMicropetrography.'\r\n\r\n\"In Zoology, Williamson initiated the work done in the study of\r\n_deep-sea deposits_, by his remarkable memoir on the mud of the\r\nLevant, in 1845, when he was 29 years old. This led to his study of\r\nthe Foraminifera (especially by the aid of thin sections) and to his\r\nmonograph in the Ray Society on that group....\r\n\r\n\"Of his contributions to Botany through his sections of 'Coal balls' I\r\nneed say nothing.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Judd makes no reference here to the papers which obtained for\r\nWilliamson his F.R.S. in 1854. These embodied his researches on the\r\ndevelopment of bone and teeth, in which he demonstrated that the teeth\r\nare dermal appendages homologous with the scales of fishes. This\r\nimportant work dated back to 1842 and was inspired by his enthusiasm\r\nfor the then novel cell-theory of Schleiden and Schwann.\r\n\r\nThe interest aroused by this investigation is shown by the fact that\r\nthe great German anatomist Kölliker travelled to Manchester, about the\r\nyear 1851, to see Williamson's preparations.\r\n\r\nAs regards Williamson's work as a botanist, in which we are chiefly\r\ninterested in this course, his best contribution to recent botany was\r\nno doubt his investigation of _Volvox_, published in 1851 and 1852,\r\nin which he traced the development of the young spheres and the mode\r\nof connection of their cells, anticipating the results of much later\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\nHe was a great lover of living plants; his garden and greenhouses at\r\nFallowfield, his Manchester home, were of remarkable interest, and he\r\nwas a keen gardener. At the British Association Meeting of 1887 one of\r\nhis guests said that \"most of the distinguished botanists of Europe\r\nand America were in the garden, and not one but who had seen something\r\ngrowing he never saw before[126].\" Insectivorous plants and the rarer\r\nvascular cryptogams were specially well represented. It was from his\r\nprivate garden that his classes were supplied with specimens.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, fossil plants engaged Williamson's attention in his\r\nearliest years, when as a mere boy he contributed to Lindley and\r\nHutton's _Fossil Flora_.\r\n\r\nHis first important independent work in this field was his paper\r\n\"On the Structure and Affinities of the Plants hitherto known as\r\nSternbergiae\" (1851), in which he proved, for the first time, that\r\nthese curious fossils, resembling a _rouleau_ of coins, were casts\r\nof the discoid pith of _Dadoxylon_, or, as we should now say, of\r\nCordaiteae--the first step in the reconstruction of this early\r\ngymnospermous family. This investigation, to which he appears to have\r\nbeen led almost accidentally, through some good specimens coming into\r\nhis hands, brought him back, as he says, to his old subject of fossil\r\nbotany. It was long, however, before he got fairly started on his great\r\ncourse of investigations on Carboniferous plants.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he had returned to the Yorkshire Oolitic plants and,\r\nabout 1847, published a paper in the Proceedings of the Yorkshire\r\nPhilosophical Society, \"On the Scaly Vegetable Heads or collars\r\nfrom Runswick Bay, supposed to belong to the _Zamia gigas_.\" His\r\nfull paper, in which he maintained the Cycadean affinities of the\r\nflower-like fossils, was written soon afterwards, but met with a\r\nseries of misfortunes, and was not finally published till 1870, in the\r\n_Transactions of the Linnean Society_, before which body it had been\r\nread in 1868. Williamson was admittedly right in connecting the floral\r\norgans with the so-called _Zamia_ foliage, and his interpretation of\r\nthe complicated structure was as good as was possible in the then state\r\nof knowledge. The true nature of these fossils, now known by the name\r\n_Williamsonia_, given them by Mr Carruthers, could only be understood\r\nat a much later date in the light of Dr Wieland's famous researches\r\non the American Bennettiteae, and has quite recently been made clear\r\nin a memoir by Prof. Nathorst. Perhaps, even now, some points remain\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nEarly in the fifties Williamson made some rough sections of a Calamite\r\nwhich came into his hands, and this was the beginning of his most\r\ncharacteristic line of work. A remarkable internal cast of a Calamite,\r\nfigured by Lyell in his _Manual of Geology_ in 1855, led to a\r\ncorrespondence with M. Grand'Eury, now so famous as the veteran French\r\npalaeobotanist. Williamson at that time had no intention of entering\r\non the serious study of Carboniferous plants, for Binney was already\r\nin the field. Grand'Eury's letter, however, caused him to look up his\r\nold sections, which he found differed from the Calamitean stems figured\r\nby Binney. Matters for a time moved slowly, and Williamson's specimen\r\nwas only described in 1868 in the _Manchester Memoirs_. This fossil,\r\nwhich he named _Calamopitus_, is now known as _Arthrodendron_, and is\r\na distinct type of Calamarian stem, intermediate between the common\r\n_Calamites_ or _Arthropitys_, and the more elaborate _Calamodendron_ of\r\nthe Upper Coal Measures.\r\n\r\nWilliamson was now fairly started on his Carboniferous work. His\r\nfirst memoir on the Organisation of the Fossil Plants of the Coal\r\nMeasures was communicated to the Royal Society on November 11, 1870.\r\nIt is amusing to find that the secretaries objected to the memoir\r\nbeing called Part I, since it bound the society to publish a Part II!\r\nNineteen Parts were published, the last in 1893.\r\n\r\nThe first memoir was on the Calamites, and controversy at once broke\r\nout. Williamson was from the first impressed by the manifest occurrence\r\nof exogenous, or, as we should now call it, secondary growth, both in\r\nthe Calamites and the Lepidodendreae, groups which he was convinced\r\nwere cryptogamic. The controversy with the great French school, headed\r\nby the illustrious Brongniart, is well known. As Williamson put it:\r\n\"The fight was always the same; was Brongniart right or wrong when\r\nhe uttered his dogma, that if the stem of a fossil plant contained a\r\nsecondary growth of wood, the product of a cambium layer, it could\r\nnot possibly belong to the cryptogamic division of the vegetable\r\nkingdom?[127]\"\r\n\r\nIn England, however, the dispute was on different lines. \"In August of\r\n1871,\" says Williamson, \"the British Association met at Edinburgh. At\r\nthat meeting I brought forward the subject of cambiums and secondary\r\nwoods in Cryptogams, with the result that my views were rejected by\r\nevery botanist in the room.\" There followed a controversy in the pages\r\nof _Nature_, which is of some interest, as showing the state of opinion\r\nin England at that time. Williamson tells us in his autobiography the\r\nprinciple by which he was guided in his work: \"I determined not to\r\nlook at the writings of any other observer until I had studied every\r\nspecimen in my cabinet, and arrived at my own conclusions as to what\r\nthey taught.\" In spite of this excellent rule it is probable that he\r\nwas at first unconsciously influenced by the views of Brongniart,\r\nwhich may have led him to attach too much _systematic_ importance to\r\nthe occurrence of secondary growth. At any rate he proposed at the\r\nEdinburgh meeting \"to separate the vascular Cryptogams into two groups,\r\nthe one comprehending Equisetaceae, Lycopodiaceae and Isoëtaceae, to\r\nbe termed the Cryptogamiae Exogenae, linking the Cryptogams with the\r\ntrue exogens through the Cycads; the other called the Cryptogamiae\r\nEndogenae, to comprehend the Ferns, which will unite the Cryptogams\r\nwith the Endogens through the Palmaceae[128].\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXIII\r\n\r\nRoot of _Calamites_ (_Astromyelon Williamsonis_) in transverse section.\r\n_Drawn by Williamson_]\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note in passing that his main divisions, so far as\r\nvascular Cryptogams are concerned, correspond to the Lycopsida and\r\nPteropsida of Prof. Jeffrey, though the suggested relation to the\r\nhigher plants would not be accepted by any modern botanist. In spite of\r\nWilliamson's tactical error in weighting himself with a doubtful scheme\r\nof classification, and in spite also of a faulty terminology, it is\r\neasy to see now that he had the best of the controversy, for he knew\r\nthe facts about the structure of the Carboniferous Cryptogams, which\r\nhis opponents, at that time, did not. They stuck to generalities, and\r\nthose who take the trouble to rake the ashes of this dead controversy\r\nwill at least learn that dogmatism is not confined to theology!\r\n\r\nAn interesting point is that Williamson at that time spoke of\r\nBrongniart almost as an ally[129]. The conviction that the old\r\nLepidodendrons and Calamites were \"exogenous\" then seemed to him of\r\ngreater importance even than his belief that they were Cryptogams. The\r\nEnglish opposition, however, was never really formidable, and so a\r\nchange of front became necessary, to meet the attacks of the powerful\r\nFrench school. Williamson was an energetic disputant; not content with\r\nhis numerous English publications, he published, in 1882, an article\r\nin the _Annales des Sciences Naturelles_, entitled \"Les Sigillaires\r\net les Lepidodendrées.\" This was translated into French for him by\r\nhis colleague Marcus Hartog, whose assistance he greatly valued. He\r\ndescribes this vigorous polemical treatise as \"flung like a bombshell\r\namong my opponents.\"\r\n\r\nIn time they came over, one by one, to his views, and even the most\r\nredoubtable of the French champions Bernard, Renault, before the close\r\nof his life, had made very considerable concessions to Williamson's\r\nside of the question. There is no need to dwell on the controversy;\r\nevery student now knows that the Club-mosses, the Horse-tails and the\r\nSphenophylls of Palaeozoic times formed abundant secondary tissues\r\nhomologous with those of a Gymnosperm or a Dicotyledon; the case of the\r\nSphenophylls shows that the character was not limited to arborescent\r\nplants then any more than it is among Dicotyledons at the present\r\nday. At the same time, as Williamson maintained, these groups of\r\nplants were, broadly speaking, cryptogamic. On the other hand it\r\nhas been said by a distinguished botanist that in the Fern-series\r\nsecondary growth came in together with the seed. This is not strictly\r\ncorrect, but it is true that the plants such as _Lyginodendron_, which\r\nWilliamson in his later publications cited as Ferns with secondary\r\ngrowth, have turned out to be seed-bearing. Even among the Lycopods a\r\ncertain proportion of the Lepidodendreae bore organs closely analogous\r\nto seeds. These partial concessions, which may now gracefully be made\r\nto the old Brongniartian creed, do not however really affect the\r\nimportance of Williamson's results, which Count Solms-Laubach has\r\nwell summed up in the following words: \"It was thus made evident by\r\nWilliamson that cambial growth in thickness is a character which has\r\nappeared repeatedly in the most various families of the vegetable\r\nkingdom, and was by no means acquired for the first time by the\r\nPhanerogamic stock. This is a general botanical result of the greatest\r\nimportance and the widest bearing. In this conclusion Palaeontology\r\nhas, for the first time, spoken the decisive word in a purely botanical\r\nquestion[130].\"\r\n\r\nTo attempt a review of Williamson's work in fossil botany would\r\nbe to write a treatise on the Carboniferous Flora. In every\r\ngroup--Calamites, Sphenophylls, Lycopods, Ferns, Pteridosperms,\r\nGymnosperms--his researches are among the most important documents of\r\nthe palaeobotanist, and to a great extent constitute the basis of our\r\npresent knowledge. At the time he wrote, the wealth of his material\r\nwas absolutely unrivalled, and its abundance was only equalled by the\r\nastonishing energy and skill with which he worked it out.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Calamites, he demonstrated, to use his own words, \"the\r\nunity of type existing among the British Calamites,\" abolishing the\r\nfalse distinction between Calamiteae and Calamodendreae.\r\n\r\nAmong the Sphenophyllums (although there was at first some confusion in\r\nhis nomenclature) he gave the first correct account of the anatomy, and\r\nof the organization of the cone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXIV\r\n\r\nCone of _Calamostachys Binneyana_; sporangia and sporangiophores.\r\n_Drawn by Williamson_]\r\n\r\nConcerning the Lycopods, the greater part of our knowledge is due\r\nto him. He described the structure in ten species referred to\r\n_Lepidodendron_, besides other allied forms, and placed our knowledge\r\nof the comparative anatomy, once for all, on a broad and secure basis.\r\nHis great monograph of _Stigmaria_, by some considered his best work,\r\nis still our chief authority for the subterranean organs.\r\n\r\nIn the Ferns he made important contributions to our knowledge of\r\nthe group now familiar to botanists as the Primofilices of Arber.\r\nIn particular his account of the plant now known as _Ankyropteris\r\ncorrugata_ is still among the best we possess of any member of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nIn Pteridosperms, to use the modern name, Williamson may fairly be\r\ncalled the discoverer of the important family Lyginodendreae. He\r\nappreciated their intermediate position, speaking of them, in 1887, as\r\n\"possibly the generalised ancestors of both Ferns and Cycads.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards both Pteridosperms and Gymnosperms proper, attention may\r\nbe specially called to his work on isolated seeds, in which he was\r\nsurpassed by Brongniart alone. This field of investigation, long\r\nneglected, has lately been revived with striking results.\r\n\r\nI hope that all students of fossil botany will have at least turned\r\nover the pages and the plates of Williamson's works, for only by\r\ninspection of the original memoirs can any idea be gained of his vast\r\nservices to our science.\r\n\r\nHis remarkable skill as a draughtsman (for all his memoirs are\r\nillustrated by his own hand) is not always done justice to in the\r\npublished reproductions as the fine examples of his original drawings,\r\nso kindly lent for the lecture by Mrs Williamson, will show[131]. At\r\nthe time when Williamson's main work was in progress--from 1870 to\r\n1892--geologists were probably more appreciative of its value than\r\nbotanists. Happily, in spite of occasional trouble with Referees, none\r\nof his work was lost, the Royal Society going steadily through with all\r\nthe nineteen memoirs which were entrusted to them.\r\n\r\nThe one botanist, who, up to the year 1890, estimated Williamson's work\r\nat its full value was Count Solms-Laubach, who makes the honourable\r\nboast that he knew Williamson's collection as no one else did.\r\n\r\nWilliamson's writings are not easy reading, especially for the modern\r\nbotanical student, for the terminology is often unfamiliar, and the\r\narrangement of the matter unsystematic.\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place to enter on a criticism of details, but it\r\nis necessary to call attention to the one serious mistake which ran\r\nthrough much of Williamson's work, though at the last he to a great\r\nextent corrected it himself. He was always too ready to interpret\r\nspecimens of the same fossil plant which differed in size and\r\nanatomical complexity, as developmental stages of one and the same\r\norgan. Such differences among fossils are more often due to the order\r\nof the branch on the plant, or to the level at which a section is cut.\r\nThis error led to some mistaken, and indeed impossible views of the\r\nprocess of development. I mention this partly because I have noticed\r\nthe same fundamental mistake in the work of much more modern writers.\r\n\"We are none of us infallible--not even the youngest of us,\" and among\r\nthe latest fossil-botany papers I have read, I have detected the very\r\nsame confusion between differences of size and differences of age,\r\nwhich constitutes the most serious blemish in Williamson's writings.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, Williamson in his latest independent work\r\ncorrected, as regards the Lepidodendrons, on the basis of a laborious\r\nre-investigation, the chief mistake he had made as to their process of\r\ngrowth[132]; he thus displayed an openness of mind worthy of a great\r\nnaturalist.\r\n\r\nI first saw Williamson on February 16, 1883, when I attended his\r\nFriday evening lecture at the Royal Institution, \"On some anomalous\r\nOolitic and Palaeozoic Forms of Vegetation.\" I did not, however, make\r\nhis acquaintance till six years later, when we met at the British\r\nAssociation Meeting at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in 1889. This led to a\r\nvisit to his house in company with Prof. Bower; it was on March 8,\r\n1890, that I first had a sight of his collection. I find the entry in\r\nmy diary: \"Spent 7 hours over fossils, especially _Lyginodendron_ and\r\n_Lepidodendron_, preparations magnificent.\" I at once became an ardent\r\nconvert to the cult of fossil plants to which I had hitherto been\r\nindifferent, though I must in fairness admit that Count Solms-Laubach's\r\n_Einleitung_ had done something to prepare the way. I well remember\r\nthe state of enthusiasm in which I returned home from Manchester. A\r\nsubsequent visit confirmed me in the faith, but it was some little\r\ntime before I put my convictions into practice. In 1892 Williamson,\r\nthen in his 76th year, resigned the Manchester Professorship and came\r\nto live near London. In the same year I migrated to Kew, and it was\r\nagreed that we should work in concert, an arrangement which received\r\nevery encouragement from the then Director, Thiselton-Dyer. Williamson\r\nfirst came to the Jodrell Laboratory on Friday, December 2, 1892. Then,\r\nand on many later visits, he carried a satchel over his shoulder,\r\ncrammed with the treasures of his collection. For some months he came\r\npretty regularly once a week, afterwards less often. On these visits we\r\ndiscussed the work I had done on the sections during the interval, and\r\nsometimes our discussions were decidedly lively. In the end, however,\r\nwe always managed to come to a satisfactory agreement. Our first joint\r\npaper (_Calamites_, _Calamostachys_ and _Sphenophyllum_) was sent\r\noff to the Royal Society, rather more than a year from the start, on\r\nDecember 29, 1893.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of 1894 Williamson came occasionally to Kew, and\r\nour discussions were renewed, this time chiefly on _Lyginodendron_. Our\r\nsecond paper (Roots of Calamites) was despatched on October 30, 1894.\r\n\r\nAfter a considerable interval Williamson again visited Kew, on December\r\n12, 1894, when we started on his _Lepidodendron_ sections, a subject on\r\nwhich we never published in conjunction. His last visit was on January\r\n7, 1895. A few days later his health broke down, and though there were\r\nmany fluctuations he was never able to come to the laboratory again.\r\nI saw him last, at his own house, on June 4th. On the 13th I read our\r\njoint paper on _Lyginodendron_ and _Heterangium_ at the Royal Society;\r\non the 23rd he passed peacefully away.\r\n\r\nIf Williamson could have lived it would, I think, have given him great\r\npleasure to see the success, in his own country, of the work which he\r\ninaugurated and the progress of the subject to which he devoted the\r\nlast 25 years of his life. I am happy to believe that he felt in the\r\nevening of his days, that the period of comparative neglect through\r\nwhich his work had passed, was at an end. For myself, I may say that my\r\nwork, since I knew Williamson, owes its inspiration to him. But quite\r\napart from our scientific relations it is a great privilege to have\r\nknown him. Though his many-sided activity, as physician, professor,\r\npopular lecturer, geologist, zoologist, botanist and artist involved\r\nan amount of work which to us of a less strenuous generation is almost\r\ninconceivable, Williamson was as far as possible from being the mere\r\nstudent.

From unavoidable causes he left school at\r\n14, but afterwards continued his education by attending evening classes\r\norganised under the Science and Art Department. To that Department,\r\nhe owed indirectly the opportunity of a useful and brilliant career.\r\nHis means were small, and his earliest aim was to qualify as a science\r\nteacher. He was admitted to a course of instruction for teachers in\r\ntraining given by Prof. Huxley in 1874-5. Although he must have derived\r\nfrom it a sound insight into the principles of zoology, the subject\r\ndoes not seem to have had any permanent attraction for him.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1857 Ward came under my hands in a course of\r\ninstruction in botany which I conducted with Prof. Vines in the Science\r\nSchools at South Kensington, and from this time onwards we were in\r\nintimate relations to the close of his life. I can best tell the story\r\nas it came under my eyes. It contains much that could not easily be\r\ndealt with in any other way.\r\n\r\nIt was soon apparent that we had got hold of a man of exceptional\r\nability. It must be confessed that the atmosphere was stimulating, and\r\nthe conditions under which the teaching was carried on necessitated\r\nits being given at high pressure. I remember that on one occasion\r\nWard fainted at his work, from no other cause, I think, than\r\nover-excitement. In the autumn of the same year he went for one session\r\nto Owens College, Manchester, with the object of continuing his general\r\neducation. I learn that he carried off the prizes in every subject that\r\nhe took up.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding year I was glad to avail myself of the assistance of\r\nWard as demonstrator in a subsequent course at South Kensington, which\r\nI undertook with Prof. Vines. Later in the year he became a candidate\r\nfor and secured an open scholarship at Christ's College, where Vines\r\nhimself was then a Fellow, and went into residence in October, 1876.\r\n\r\nWard took full advantage of his opportunities at Cambridge, and\r\nattended the teaching of Sir Michael Foster in physiology and of\r\nProf. F. M. Balfour in comparative anatomy. The sound and fundamental\r\nconceptions which he acquired from the former manifestly influenced his\r\nwork throughout life. He took a first class in botany in the Natural\r\nScience Tripos in 1879. His first published paper was the result of\r\nwork in the same year in the Jodrell Laboratory at Kew. In this,\r\nwhich was published in the _Proceedings of the Linnean Society_, he\r\nseriously criticised and corrected that of Vesque on the embryo-sac of\r\nPhanerogams.\r\n\r\nAs was customary with our young botanists, Ward went to Germany for\r\na short time, for purposes of study and to strengthen his knowledge\r\nof the language. He worked at Würzburg with Sachs, whose lectures\r\non the physiology of plants he afterwards translated in 1887. There\r\nhe continued his study of the embryo-sac in Orchideae, as Sachs\r\nsubsequently testified, \"zu meiner vollsten Zufriedenheit.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year Ward was appointed on the recommendation of\r\nKew to proceed to Ceylon for two years as Government Cryptogamist to\r\ninvestigate the leaf-disease in coffee. The history of this malady\r\nis almost unique in vegetable pathology. A native fungus which had\r\neluded scientific observation, and must therefore have maintained an\r\ninconspicuous and limited existence on some native host-plant, found\r\na wider opportunity on the Arabian coffee plant and fell upon it as a\r\ndevastating scourge. It was first detected in 1869 on a single estate;\r\nin 1873 there was probably none in the island entirely free from it. Mr\r\n(since Sir Daniel) Morris had shown that the plants could be cleansed\r\nby dusting them with a mixture of sulphur and lime. But the remedy\r\nproved of no avail as the plants speedily became re-infected. Morris\r\nhad been transferred to another appointment in the West Indies and\r\nWard's duty was to take up the investigation. This he accomplished\r\nexhaustively. He showed that the fungus (_Hemileia vastatrix_) was one\r\nof the Uredineae and that infection was produced by the wind-borne\r\nuredospores. Had the planters, as in Southern India, left forest belts\r\nbetween their plantations, the spores might have been filtered out\r\nand the disease controlled. As it was it spread like an unchecked\r\nconflagration. Ward also discovered the teleutospores; nothing has been\r\nadded to our knowledge of its life-history beyond what he obtained. The\r\nresult of his investigations was given in three official reports and in\r\npapers contributed in 1882 to the Linnean Society and the _Quarterly\r\nJournal of Microscopical Science_. It was no blame to him that his work\r\nled to no practical result. The mischief admitted of no remedy. The\r\ncoffee-planting industry of Ceylon was destroyed and the Oriental Bank\r\nsuccumbed in the general ruin. Leaf disease has now extended to every\r\ncoffee-growing country in the Old World from Natal to Fiji.\r\n\r\nIn a tropical country leaves supply a substratum to a little flora of\r\ntheir own, consisting of organisms partly algal, partly fungal, in\r\ntheir affinity. Ward, who had already developed his characteristic\r\nhabit of never neglecting any point incidental to a research,\r\ncarefully studied them, in order both to ascertain how far their\r\npresence affected the health of the leaf itself and to work out their\r\nlife-history. The outcome was three important papers. One on Meliola,\r\nan obscure genus of tropical epiphyllous fungi, belonging to the\r\nPyrenomycetes, was published in the _Philosophical Transactions_\r\nin 1883. Bornet's classical memoir published in 1851 had been the\r\nauthority on the subject. Ward was able to fill up \"large gaps in\r\nthe knowledge of important details.\" Another paper published in the\r\n_Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science_ in 1882 on an Asterina\r\nilluminates an allied organism. But the crown of all Ward's Ceylon\r\nwork was the splendid memoir on a Tropical Epiphyllous Lichen which\r\nwas published by the Linnean Society in 1883. In this he, I think,\r\ncleared up much that was obscure in the _Mycoidea parasitica_ described\r\nby D. D. Cunningham. Having myself communicated the paper, I shall\r\nalways remember the pleasure with which I undertook in Ward's absence\r\nto give an account of it. He solved the problem with convincing\r\ncompleteness; he extended Schwendener's lichen theory to a group of\r\nobscure epiphyllous organisms of which he afforded, for the first time,\r\na rational explanation. The success with which this was accomplished\r\nplaced him at once in the first rank of mycological investigators.\r\n\r\nDe Bary was the leading authority on Uredineae; and in 1882 Ward paid\r\na short visit to him at Strasburg to confer with him on his coffee\r\ndisease work, the accuracy of which de Bary entirely confirmed. There\r\nhe made the acquaintance of Elfving and completed his Meliola paper.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for Ward was now precarious. Fortunately, I found myself\r\nsitting next to Sir Henry Roscoe at a Royal Society dinner, and I\r\nsuggested that Ward, as an old student of Owens College, would be\r\na fitting recipient of a Bishop Berkeley Fellowship for original\r\nresearch. Principal Greenwood recorded the fact that \"the very\r\nimportant results already achieved by Mr Ward in Ceylon, in the\r\ndomain of the higher botany, led the Senate and the Council to make\r\nthis appointment.\" In 1883, he was appointed Assistant Lecturer and\r\nDemonstrator in Botany, and, on the same testimony, \"abundantly\r\njustified his election.\" It was a peculiar pleasure to him to relieve\r\nthe veteran Professor Williamson by taking entire charge of Vegetable\r\nPhysiology and Histology. His position was, in the same year, made\r\nsecure by his election to a Fellowship at Christ's College, and he\r\nmarried the eldest daughter of the late Francis Kingdon, of Exeter,\r\nwho was a connection of Clifford the mathematician.\r\n\r\nThe passion for research now completely possessed Ward and never left\r\nhim for the rest of his life. He published papers which added much to\r\nour knowledge of the Saprolegnieae a group of fungi of aquatic habit,\r\npartly saprophytic and partly parasitic. It is interesting to note\r\nthat he was particularly attracted by the mode in which the hyphae\r\nattack the tissues on which they prey. This was a matter on which he\r\nsubsequently threw an entirely new light. He made the interesting\r\ndiscovery of an aquatic Myxomycete, such a mode of existence being\r\nhitherto unknown in the group, and worked out its life-history. But\r\nhis mind had now become definitely fixed on the problems presented by\r\nplant diseases, and they remained the principal occupation of his life.\r\nIn their widest sense these resolve themselves into a consideration of\r\nthe mode in which one organism obtains its nutriment at the expense\r\nof another. This ranges from a complete destruction of the host by\r\nthe parasite to a harmless and even advantageous symbiosis. He was\r\nthus naturally led to an exhaustive study of the literature of the\r\nSchizomycetes, and contributed an article on the group in 1886 to the\r\n_Encyclopaedia Britannica_, which, for the time at any rate, gives\r\nthe best account of it, certainly in English, and probably in any\r\nother language. When he supplemented this in 1902 by the article on\r\nBacteriology, it was largely to give an account of his own important\r\ndiscoveries. In the earlier one, he had pointed out the difficulties of\r\na natural classification of Schizomycetes due to their pleomorphism,\r\nwhich Lankester had demonstrated in 1873. He returned to the subject in\r\nan article in the _Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science_ in 1892.\r\nIt may be noted that, in his British Association address at Toronto, he\r\ntook occasion to put in their proper relation the work of Cohn and of\r\nhis pupil Koch.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, the Regius Professorship of Botany at Glasgow was vacant by\r\nthe transference of Prof. Balfour to Oxford. Ward was a candidate\r\nwith the warm support of his fellow-botanists. It was thought that\r\nhis Colonial services would weigh with the Government; but other\r\ninfluences were at work in favour of another candidate, whom, however,\r\nthe University refused to accept. A deadlock ensued, which was only\r\nsolved by the Government finally refusing to appoint either candidate.\r\nThis was a great disappointment to Ward, which was in some degree\r\nmitigated by his appointment to the new Chair of Botany in the Forestry\r\nBranch of the Royal Indian Engineering College, Cooper's Hill. The\r\nutilitarian atmosphere in which he found himself was not very congenial\r\nto him. But he had at any rate at last some sort of adequate position\r\nand a laboratory to work in, and here he remained--not, I think,\r\nunhappily--for ten years. He was, as he had been at Manchester, a\r\nsuccessful teacher, and had the gift of interesting his pupils, whom\r\nhe used to bring weekly to Kew during the summer months to visit the\r\nArboretum. In point of research, this was the period of much of his\r\nmost brilliant work.\r\n\r\nThe study of Uredineae occupied Ward at intervals during his life.\r\nThe reproductive organs are pleomorphic, and it is no easy task to\r\nascertain with certainty those that belong to the same life-history.\r\nIn a paper on _Entyloma Ranunculi_, published in the _Phil. Trans._ in\r\n1887, Ward for the first time traced the germination of the conidia\r\nof an Entyloma, and confirmed Winter's suggestion that they were not\r\nan independent organism, but actually belonged to it. Incidentally he\r\ndiscussed the conditions which are favourable to the invasion of a host\r\nby a parasitic fungus. This raised the question of immunity, to which\r\nat intervals he repeatedly returned.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time he published in the _Quarterly Journal of\r\nMicroscopical Science_ the results of an investigation undertaken for\r\nthe Science and Art Department on the mode of infection of the potato\r\nplant by _Phytophthora infestans_, which produces the potato disease.\r\nIt was not easy to add anything to the classical work of de Bary, but\r\nit was ascertained that \"the development of the zoospores is delayed or\r\neven arrested by direct daylight,\" and Ward's attention was attracted\r\nto the problem, which he afterwards solved, of how the hyphae erode the\r\ncell-wall.\r\n\r\nThe solution was given in 1888 in a paper in the _Annals of Botany_,\r\n\"On a Lily Disease,\" which has now become classical. He discusses\r\nthe fungus which produces it, and shows that the tips of the hyphae\r\nsecrete a cellulose-dissolving ferment which enables them to pierce\r\nthe cell-walls of the host. This ferment has since been described as\r\ncytase. He shows that its production would determine the passage from a\r\nmerely saprophytic to a parasitic habit, and makes the suggestion that\r\nan organism might be educated to pass from one to the other.\r\n\r\nAn admirable research (1887) was on the formation of the yellow dye\r\nobtained from \"Persian berries\" (_Rhamnus infectorius_). A dyer had\r\nfound that uninjured berries afforded a poorer colouring liquor than\r\ncrushed. Gellatly had found, in 1851, that they contained a glucoside,\r\nxanthorhamnin, which sulphuric acid broke up into rhamnetin and\r\ngrape-sugar. The problem was to localise the ferment which did the\r\nwork. Ward obtained the unexpected result that it was confined to the\r\nraphe of the seed.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1883 Ward had attacked a problem which he pursued at\r\nintervals for some years, and which was fraught with consequences\r\nwholly unforeseen at the time. It had long been known that leguminous\r\nplants almost invariably carried tubercular swellings on their roots.\r\nThe opinion had gradually gained ground that they were due to the\r\naction of a parasite. Bacteria-like corpuscles had been found in the\r\ncells of the tubercle, and it was assumed that they had played some\r\npart in exciting the growth of the latter. \"No one had as yet succeeded\r\nin infecting the roots and in producing the tubercles artificially.\"\r\nWard described, in a paper in the _Phil. Trans._ in 1887, how he had\r\naccomplished this. He showed, in fact, that a definite organism invades\r\nthe roots from the soil, and finds its access by the root-hairs.\r\n\r\nLawes and Gilbert had long ago proved that the higher plants are\r\nincapable of assimilating free nitrogen. Hellriegel and Wilfarth\r\nhad, however, shown in 1886 that leguminous plants carry away more\r\nnitrogen from the soil than could be accounted for. This Ward confirmed\r\nby his own pot-experiments, and satisfied himself that the excess\r\ncould only be derived from the free nitrogen of the air. Hellriegel\r\nfurther concluded that the tubercles played an essential part in the\r\nprocess. Ward had no doubt that the bacteroids were the channel of\r\nsupply. But he failed to get any proof that they could assimilate free\r\nnitrogen outside the plant. He suggested that their symbiosis might be\r\nan essential condition, and was obliged finally to leave it an open\r\nquestion whether the cells of the tubercles or the bacteroids were\r\nthe active agents in nitrogen assimilation. He had already stated in\r\n1887 that it is very probable that the bacteroids \"may be of extreme\r\nimportance in agriculture.\" But he was never satisfied with anything\r\nshort of the strictest proof.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Ward was invited to deliver the Croonian Lecture. He chose for\r\nhis subject the relation between host and parasite in plant disease. He\r\ndefined disease in its most generalised form as \"the outcome of a want\r\nof balance in the struggle for existence.\" But the particular problem\r\nto which he addressed himself was the way in which the balance is\r\nturned when one organism is invaded by another. This is the most common\r\ntype of disease in plants and a not infrequent one in animals. The\r\nfirst result reached was identical with that of Pasteur for the latter;\r\nthe normal organism is intrinsically resistant to disease. It is an\r\nimmediate inference that natural selection would make it so. Ward then\r\ndiscusses very clearly the physiological conditions of susceptibility,\r\nwhich he shows to be a deviation from the normal. He had already\r\nindicated this in the case of Entyloma. The epidemic phase is reached\r\nwhen the environment is unfavourable to the host but not so or even\r\nfavourable to the parasite. He then attacks the more obscure case where\r\nthere is no obvious susceptibility. This, he finds, resolves itself\r\ninto a mere case of the struggle for existence: \"a struggle between\r\nthe hypha of the fungus and the cells of the host.\" It is more subtle\r\nin its operation but of the same order of ruthlessness as the ravages\r\nof a carnivore. Ward's account of the struggle is almost dramatic. The\r\ncellulose \"outworks\" are first broken down, as he had previously shown,\r\nby a secreted ferment. The \"real tug of war\" comes when the hypha is\r\nface to face with the ectoplasm. Its resistance is at once overcome by\r\nflooding it with a poison, probably oxalic acid.\r\n\r\nWar with attack and defence is a product of evolution. How did it come\r\nabout in this particular case? Ward convincingly traces out the whole\r\nprocess. The normal plant obtains its food from inorganic material. But\r\nwhen opportunity offers it easily lapses into a condition in which it\r\ntakes the material for metabolism ready made from the decay of others\r\nand becomes saprophytic. Ward shows that it is only a step to the\r\nattack on the living, and for the saprophyte to become a parasite, and\r\nhe further shows that it can be readily educated to be so. He does not\r\nhesitate to suggest that the function of conidia in the complicated\r\ncycle of fungal reproduction is to form the cellulose-dissolving\r\nferment. But now and again the host does not succumb to its invader.\r\nA truce is sometimes called in the struggle, and host and parasite\r\nare content to live together in a mutually advantageous symbiosis or\r\ncommensalism.\r\n\r\nThree years earlier, in 1887, Ward's attention had been drawn by a\r\nhappy accident to the physiological aspect of symbiosis, and it never\r\nceased to occupy his mind. It was well known that ginger-beer was\r\nmade in villages in stone bottles. The fermentation was effected by\r\nthe so-called \"ginger-beer plant\" which was passed on from family to\r\nfamily, but nothing was known as to how or where it originated. It\r\nseemed to have some analogy with the Kephir of the Caucasus. A specimen\r\nwas sent to me from the Eastern Counties, and it stood for some time\r\nin the sun in my study. I noticed the vigorous growth accompanied by a\r\ncopious evolution of gas. Ward coming to see me one day, I handed it\r\nover to him as a problem worth his attention. At the same time Prof.\r\nBayley Balfour had examined it and concluded that it was a mixture of\r\na yeast and a bacterium. Its study involved Ward in a very laborious\r\nresearch which occupied him for some years, and of which the results\r\nwere published in the _Phil. Trans._ in 1892. It proved to be a mixture\r\nof very various organisms, every one of which Ward exhaustively\r\nstudied. This required not less than 2000 separate cultures. The\r\nessential components proved to be, as Balfour had suggested, a yeast\r\nderived from the sugar and a bacterium from the ginger. Both were\r\nanaërobic; the yeast fermented cane-sugar with the copious production\r\nof carbon dioxide but little alcohol; the bacterium also produced\r\ncarbon dioxide, even in a vacuum tube.\r\n\r\nThe action of the two components studied separately proved to be not\r\nthe same as when they worked in concert. This was conspicuously the\r\ncase with the evolution of carbon dioxide, which proceeded with such\r\nviolence as to make the research attended with considerable danger. It\r\nis known that the action of ferments may be checked by the inhibition\r\nof the products formed. Ward pointed out that while the use of these\r\nmight be advantageous to the bacterium, their consequent removal might\r\nbe equally so to the yeast. This established the important principle\r\nof symbiotic fermentation and gave it a rational explanation. On the\r\nmorphological side Ward showed that the ginger-beer plant is comparable\r\nto a gelatinous lichen, and, having resolved it into its constituents,\r\nsuccessfully reconstituted it.\r\n\r\nThe new conception threw a flood of light on many obscure points in\r\nfermentation generally, and it is not surprising that Ward's work at\r\nonce attracted the attention of the brewing industry. It led him to an\r\neven more fertile suggestion, that of metabiosis. It was known that the\r\nfinest wine is sometimes produced from mouldy grapes. He regarded this\r\nas a case of one organism preparing the way for another. He returned\r\nto the subject in a lecture given at the British Association at Dover\r\nin 1899 and pointed out that in the Japanese manufacture of Saké,\r\nan Aspergillus prepares the way for the yeast. He also showed that\r\nmetabiosis played an important part in nitrification.\r\n\r\nFungi cannot draw their nutriment from solid materials without first\r\nprofoundly modifying them. They accomplish a large part of their\r\ndigestion, so to speak, externally to themselves. This constantly\r\noccupied Ward's mind. He insisted on the part played in the process by\r\nferments. The hyphae of Stereum (_Phil. Trans._ 1898) delignify the\r\nwalls of the wood elements of Aesculus layer by layer, and then consume\r\nthe swollen cellulose. He failed, however, to isolate the ferment which\r\ndoes the work. Nor was he more fortunate with the little known fungus\r\nOnygena, which grows on horn, hoofs and hair, setting free ammonia\r\nas a final product (_Phil. Trans._ 1899). That there must be some\r\nhydrolysis of keratin can hardly be doubted, for Ward established the\r\nremarkable fact that the walls of the hyphae contain no cellulose, but\r\nare composed of chitin. Onygena has, in fact, abandoned a plant for an\r\nanimal nutrition. This would place the germination of the species at\r\na great disadvantage. But he found that this difficulty was overcome\r\nby the spores which had been licked from the skin germinating in the\r\ngastric juice of the animal's stomach, and, when voided in the excreta,\r\ninfecting a new host by accidental contact. In the case of both Stereum\r\nand Onygena he accomplished for the first time the difficult task of\r\ntracing their life-history from spore to fructification.\r\n\r\nWard had prepared himself for the study of bacteria, and in the\r\nnineties he undertook, with Prof. Percy Frankland, a prolonged research\r\non behalf of the Royal Society as to the conditions of their occurrence\r\nin potable water. The reports of the results fill a thick volume, and\r\nthe amount of work involved is almost incredible. The bacteriology was\r\nentirely due to Ward.\r\n\r\nThat bacteria are not an inevitable element in potable water is proved\r\nby their absence from that of deep springs. They are arrested by\r\nfiltration through the earth's crust. In any river system they are\r\ncomparatively fewer towards the watershed, and more frequent towards\r\nthe mouth. The obvious conclusion is that they are derived from the\r\ndrainage of the land. As it is known that the bacteria of cholera and\r\ntyphoid are water-borne, it becomes a problem of vital importance to\r\nascertain if river water is a possible means of distributing these\r\ndiseases. Ward set to work to ascertain: (i) What was the actual\r\nbacterial flora of Thames water; (ii) if this included any pathogenic\r\norganisms; (iii) if not, what became of them? The labour required by\r\nthe first two branches of the enquiry was enormous; he identified and\r\ncultivated some eighty species; the resulting answer to the second was\r\nhappily in the negative.\r\n\r\nAs to the third, two facts were known. First, that river water,\r\nif stored, largely cleared itself of bacteria by mere subsidence;\r\nsecondly, that Downes and Blunt, in a classical paper communicated to\r\nthe Royal Society in 1877, had shown that exposure to direct sunlight\r\nis fatal to bacteria in a fluid medium. Ward showed that subsidence\r\ncould not be entirely relied on, as the sediment might easily become\r\nthe source of re-infection. The effect of sunlight required more\r\ncritical examination.\r\n\r\nIt was known that the spores of anthrax were liable to be washed\r\ninto rivers. Ward determined to study this as the most extreme\r\ntype of pathogenic infection. As it is undoubtedly the most deadly\r\nmicro-organism known, and Ward proposed to deal with it on a large\r\nscale, it implied no small degree of courage. He found that the spores\r\nof anthrax were effectually killed by a few hours' exposure to even the\r\nreflected light of a low winter sun. It was clear that this was due to\r\nthe direct action of the light and not to any heating effect, apart\r\nfrom the fact that they will tolerate boiling for a few minutes. It was\r\nfurther shown that there was no foundation for the theory of Roux and\r\nDuclaux that their death was due to poisoning by products of oxidation\r\nof the food-medium. Proof of this, indeed, was hardly required, for\r\nPasteur had shown that the bacteria floating in the atmosphere are\r\nmostly dead. Were it not so, no surgical operation would be possible.\r\nTo the bactericidal effect of sunlight is equally to be attributed the\r\nabsence of bacteria from the High Alps.\r\n\r\nThe next point was to ascertain to what rays the effect was due. The\r\nspores of anthrax are so minute that, when mixed in large numbers with\r\ngelatine, they do not affect its transparency, A plate of glass coated\r\nwith the mixture is at first clear, but ceases to be so if kept in the\r\ndark, owing to the germination of the spores. Ward found, in fact, that\r\na photograph could be printed with it, the darkening being the reverse\r\nof that of a silver plate. After experiments with coloured screens\r\nhe completely solved the problem in 1893, with the aid of apparatus\r\nsupplied by Sir Oliver Lodge and some advice from Sir Gabriel Stokes,\r\nby photographing the spectrum on such a plate. It was at once seen\r\nthat the destructive effect was due to rays of high refrangibility,\r\nand, what was extremely important, extended to, and found its maximum\r\nin, the ultra-violet. The same results were obtained with the typhoid\r\nbacillus. He made the suggestion that the arc light might be used for\r\nthe disinfection of hospitals and railway carriages.\r\n\r\nComparatively little was known of the life history of any Schizomycete.\r\nWard therefore made a detailed and exhaustive study of that of\r\n_Bacillus ramosus_, the _Wurzel bacillus_ of German authors, which is\r\ncommon in Thames water, and bears a superficial resemblance to the\r\nanthrax bacillus, but is innocuous. It proved convenient for study, as\r\nit ran through its entire life history in from thirty to sixty hours\r\nat ordinary temperature. It forms long filaments, the growth of which\r\nWard was able to measure under the microscope with great precision. On\r\nplotting out his measurements he obtained a regular curve, from which\r\nhe found that, under constant conditions, the filament doubled itself\r\nin equal times. This he called \"the law of doubling.\" It is the same as\r\nthe so-called \"law of compound interest,\" and leads to the expression\r\nof the growing quantity as an exponential function of the time, so\r\nthat the time is proportional to the logarithm of that quantity. This\r\nrelation has, of course, long been familiar in chemical reactions, but,\r\nas far as I know, Ward was the first to detect it in any vital process\r\nin a plant. This, which was in 1895, has, I think, been overlooked.\r\nStefanowska has since, in 1904, obtained a logarithmic curve for the\r\nearly period of the growth of maize, which doubles its weight every ten\r\ndays, and the subject has since been pursued by Chodat and others.\r\n\r\nIn speculating on the cause of the destructive action of light on\r\nbacteria, Ward adopted the view of his friend Elfving, that it\r\ninhibited metabolic processes necessary to nutrition. He suggests that\r\nthe \"constructed metabolites\" at the moment of assimilation are in\r\na highly unstable condition, and liable to destruction by oxidation\r\npromoted by light. He points to the fact that plant structures are\r\nfrequently provided with colour screens, which would cut off the\r\nblue-violet rays and check their action in promoting the rapid\r\noxidation of reserve materials, and he quotes the suggestion of Elfving\r\nthat chlorophyll itself may serve as such a screen against \"destructive\r\nmetabolic action in synthesis.\" Ward seems to have attributed little\r\nimportance to the fact that substantially the same view had long before\r\nbeen put forward by Pringsheim, though received with little favour. His\r\nown view that when red and orange predominate in the screens their\r\neffect is protective, has since afforded a probable explanation of the\r\ncolouration of young foliage, especially in the tropics.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be doubted that the upshot of Ward's laborious\r\ninvestigations has had a powerful influence in deciding the policy\r\nof the future water supply of London. If we hear nothing now of\r\nobtaining it from Wales, it is because we know that even polluted\r\nflood-water if exposed in large reservoirs will rid itself of its\r\nbacterial contamination, partly, as was known already, by subsidence,\r\nbut most effectually, as shown by Ward, by the destruction of its most\r\ndeleterious constituents by the direct action of sunlight.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, Ward was called to the Chair of Botany at Cambridge. He was\r\nsupported by a distinguished body of fellow-workers, and developed a\r\nflourishing school, in which every branch of the science found its\r\nscope. The University erected for it an institute which is probably the\r\nbest equipped in the country, and in March, 1904, I had the pleasure of\r\nseeing Ward receive the King and Queen at its inauguration.\r\n\r\nDuring the later years of Ward's life he returned to the study of the\r\nUredineae. The scourge of wheat perhaps from the dawn of agriculture\r\nhas been \"Rust,\"\r\n\r\n  \"Ut mala culmos esset rubigo ... intereunt segetes\";\r\n\r\nand the loss inflicted by it throughout the world is probably not\r\ncalculable. But the history of the Ceylon coffee disease is only too\r\npatent an instance of the injury a uredine can effect.\r\n\r\nEriksson, the most recent authority on the subject, had found himself\r\nquite unable to account for sudden outbursts of rust which it did not\r\nseem possible to attribute to the result of infection. In 1897 he\r\nlaunched his celebrated theory of the Mycoplasm. He supposed that a\r\ncereal subject to rust was permanently diseased and always had been;\r\nthat the protoplasm of the Uredo-parasite and of the cereal, though\r\ndiscrete, were intermingled and were continuously propagated together;\r\nbut that while that of the latter was continuously active, that of the\r\nformer might be latent till called into activity by conditions which\r\nfavoured it. Ward discussed the theory in his British Association\r\naddress at Toronto, and was evidently a good deal impressed with it,\r\nbut nothing short of actual demonstration ever convinced him; and when\r\nhe proceeded to investigate the actual histological facts on which the\r\ntheory rested he promptly exploded it.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that Ward, as I know from correspondence at\r\nthe time, had himself been embarrassed in investigating the Ceylon\r\ncoffee disease by the same kind of appearance which had misled\r\nEriksson. It is due to an optical fallacy. When the hypha of a uredine\r\nattacks a cell it is unable to perforate it with its whole diameter. It\r\ninfects it, however, with a reduced and slender filament; this expands\r\nagain after perforation into a rounded body, the haustorium. In a\r\ntangential section the perforating filament cannot be distinguished,\r\nand the haustorium looks like an independent body immersed in the\r\ncell-protoplasm and with no external connection. It requires a\r\nfortunate normal section to reveal what has really taken place. Ward\r\nwas accordingly able, in a paper in the _Phil. Trans._ in 1903, to\r\ndispose conclusively of the mycoplasm. This cleared the ground of an\r\nuntenable hypothesis. The complicated nature of the problem which still\r\npresented itself for investigation can only be briefly indicated.\r\nSir Joseph Banks, whose scientific instinct was sound but curiously\r\ninarticulate, had pointed out that the spores entered the stomata, and\r\nwarned farmers against using rusted litter. Henslow, one of Ward's\r\npredecessors in the Cambridge chair, had been confirmed by Tulasne in\r\nshowing that the uredo-and puccinia-spores (of the barberry) belonged\r\nto the same fungus. De Bary traced the germination of the spores and\r\nthe mode in which the hyphae invaded the host; the fundamental fact,\r\nwhich he observed but did not explain, was that the germinal filament,\r\nafter growing for a time superficially, bent down to enter the tissues\r\nof its host. Pfeffer in 1883 discovered chemotaxis, the directive\r\naction of chemical substances on the movement of mobile organisms. De\r\nBary had previously hinted that the hypha might be attracted by some\r\nchemical ingredient of the host plant. Myoshi, a pupil of Pfeffer's,\r\nshowed finally in 1894 that if a plant were injected by a chemotropic\r\nsubstance a fungus-hypha not ordinarily parasitic might be made to\r\nbehave as such and attack it.\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances it might seem that the host was not merely\r\nincapable of resisting invasion by the parasite but actually invited\r\nits attack. Nature is, however, not easily baffled in the struggle for\r\nexistence. Attack provokes new methods of defence. Ward soon found\r\nhimself face to face with \"problems of great complexity,\" and these\r\noccupied the closing years of his life.\r\n\r\nIt had been ascertained in fact that the rust fungus is not, as was\r\nat first supposed, a single organism, but comprises, according to\r\nEriksson, thirteen distinct species, each with physiological varieties,\r\nand that those which are destructive to some grasses and cereals, are\r\nincapable of attacking others. This necessitated a scrutiny of the\r\nnature of grass-immunity. In a paper communicated to the Cambridge\r\nPhilosophical Society in 1902, Ward announced a conclusion which was as\r\nimportant as it was unexpected. He had more and more made use of the\r\ngraphical method for presenting to the eye at a glance the result of a\r\nmass of separate observations. In this case he uses it with striking\r\neffect. He shows conclusively, as far as rust in brome-grasses is\r\nconcerned, that: \"The capacity for infection, or for resistance to\r\ninfection, is independent of the anatomical structure of the leaf, and\r\nmust depend on some other internal factor or factors in the plant.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, he is led to the conclusion that \"it is in the domain of\r\nthe invisible biological properties of the living cell that we must\r\nexpect the phenomena to reside.\" He pointed out the probability that\r\nlight would be thrown on this from the action of chemotaxis, on the\r\none hand, and from that of toxins and antitoxins in animal organisms\r\non the other. This is a most fertile conception, which would, however,\r\nhave required a good deal of verification, and this, unhappily, he\r\ndid not live to attempt. But with characteristic ingenuity he pointed\r\nout the analogy between the infective capacity of uredospores and\r\nthe prepotency of pollen, which had previously engaged the attention\r\nof Darwin. In a paper published in the following year in the Berlin\r\n_Annales Mycologici_, he announced a no less significant result. With\r\nhis usual thoroughness in research he had cultivated side by side at\r\nCambridge more than two hundred species and varieties of Bromus,\r\nand had watched the degree to which they were infected by rust under\r\nidentical conditions. He found that though in the brome-grasses the\r\nrust peculiar to them is specifically identical its _forms_ are highly\r\nspecialised. The form which attacks the species of one group will not\r\nattack those of another. Host and parasite are mutually \"attuned.\" He\r\ntermed this \"adaptive parasitism.\" This raised the problem, which had\r\nfirst occurred to him in Ceylon, of how a parasite adapted to species\r\nof \"one circle of alliance\" can pass to those of another. Occasionally\r\nit happens that a uredo-form will infect a species where it ordinarily\r\nfails. In such a case \"its uredospore progeny will thenceforth readily\r\ninfect that species.\" Ward regarded this as a case of education.\r\nWorking on this principle, he succeeded by growing the parasite\r\n_successively_ on a series of allied species which were imperfectly\r\nresistant, to ultimately educate it to attack a species hitherto\r\nimmune. He called these \"_bridgeing species_.\" He established, in fact,\r\na complete parallelism between the behaviour of rust-fungi and that of\r\npathogenic organisms in animals.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this far-reaching research his health began to fail.\r\nIn 1904 he had been appointed by the Council to represent the Royal\r\nSociety at the International Congress of Botany held at Vienna in\r\nJune of the following year. This he attended, though more seriously\r\nill than he was aware of. On his way back he spent three weeks for\r\ntreatment at Carlsbad, but receiving no benefit, he went, on the advice\r\nof Dr Krause, to Dr von Noorden's Klinik at Sachsenhausen (Frankfort).\r\nNothing could be done for him, and he was advised to return home by\r\neasy stages. After a period of progressive and extreme weakness, borne\r\nwith unflinching courage, the end came somewhat suddenly at Torquay on\r\nAugust 26, 1906. He was buried at Cambridge in St Giles's Cemetery on\r\nSeptember 3.\r\n\r\nFrom 1880, the year following his degree, Ward never ceased for a\r\nquarter of a century to pour out a continuous stream of original work.\r\nThis alone would be a remarkable performance, had he done nothing\r\nelse. But he was constantly engaged in teaching work, and he acted as\r\nexaminer in the Universities of London and Edinburgh. With no less\r\nconscientiousness he complied with the demands which the scientific\r\nworld makes on its members; he served on the Councils of the Royal\r\n(1895) and Linnean (1887) Societies; he was President of the Botanical\r\nSection of the British Association at Toronto in 1897, and of the\r\nCambridge Philosophical Society in 1904. Beyond all this he found\r\ntime to give addresses with unfailing freshness of insight; a lecture\r\nat the Royal Institution on April 27, 1894, on the \"Action of Light\r\non Bacteria and Fungi\" was a notable performance; he wrote numerous\r\narticles of a more popular kind, and he produced a number of excellent\r\nmanuals for students on subjects connected with forest, agricultural\r\nand pathological botany. Activity so strenuous almost exceeds the\r\nlimits of human possibility.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of Sachs, Ward might have become a distinguished\r\nmorphologist. But his work in Ceylon led him into a field of research\r\nfrom which he never deviated. A survey of his performance as a\r\nwhole, such as I have attempted, has a scientific interest of its\r\nown. His research was not haphazard. A continuous and developing\r\nthread of thought runs through it all. The fundamental problem was\r\nthe transference of the nutrition of one organism to the service of\r\nanother. Of this, in Ceylon, Ward found himself confronted with two\r\nextreme types, and of both he made an exhaustive study. In Hemileia it\r\nwas ruthless parasitism; in Strigula advantageous commensalism. Bornet\r\nput Schwendener's theory on a firm foundation when he effected the\r\nsynthesis of a lichen; Ward, in another group, did the same thing for\r\nthe ginger-beer plant. In such cases the partnership is beneficial. The\r\nproblem is to trace the process by which one partner gets the upper\r\nhand and becomes merely predatory. Ward inherited a strong taste for\r\nmusic, though I believe he never cultivated it. A musical simile may\r\nnot inappropriately be applied to his work. In its whole it presents\r\nitself to me as a symphony in which the education of protoplasm is a\r\nrecurring _leit-motiv_.\r\n\r\nA few words must be said as to his personal characteristics. He had\r\nall the qualifications for the kind of research to which he devoted\r\nhimself. He was singularly dexterous and skilful in manipulation. He\r\nwas a refined and accomplished draughtsman, and was therefore able\r\nto do himself justice by illustration. He was rigorous in demanding\r\nexhaustive proof. This almost deteriorated into a defect. He would\r\npursue every side issue which presented itself in a research, and was\r\nquite content if it led to nothing. He would say in such a case: \"I\r\nwill not leave a stone unturned.\" He was apt, too, I think, to attack\r\na problem in too generalised a form. In his nitrogen work it always\r\nseemed to me that he wasted energy on remote possibilities, when a\r\nclean-cut line of attack would have served him better[134]. But his\r\nmind worked in that way, and he could not help himself. It was, I\r\nthink, one of the most fertile in suggestion that I ever came across.\r\nIn later years, in conversation especially, thought seemed to come\r\nquicker than words to express it. In this respect he reminded one of\r\nLord Kelvin. In such a predicament he would simply remain silent, and\r\nslowly move his head. This habit, I think, explains the reputation\r\nof being \"mysterious\" which he seems to have acquired latterly at\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nHe was not without the honour at home which he deserved, apart from\r\nthe affection of his friends, and had he lived would doubtless have\r\nreceived it from abroad. He was elected F.R.S. in 1888, and received\r\nthe Royal Medal in 1893. He was elected an Honorary Fellow of Christ's\r\nCollege in 1897, and received an Honorary D.Sc. from the Victoria\r\nUniversity in 1902.\r\n\r\nBotanical science could ill spare his loss at the early age of 52. But\r\nit may be grateful for 25 years of illuminating achievement. It might\r\nhave been hoped that another quarter of a century would be allotted to\r\none so gifted. But if the \"inexorabile fatum\" decreed otherwise, he is\r\nat least to be numbered amongst those of whom it may be said\r\n\r\n  \"Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[134] NOV. 1911. I must guard myself against the implication that\r\nMarshall Ward's method was wrong in principle. For as pointed out by\r\nProf. Turner in his \"Address to the Mathematical and Physical Section\"\r\nof the British Association at Portsmouth the maxim of \"leaving no stone\r\nunturned\" is identical with Prof. Chamberlin's \"Method of Multiple\r\nWorking Hypotheses.\" And what is at first sight an unlikely hypothesis\r\nmay turn out to be the true one. Yet the rigorous application of the\r\nmethod is time-consuming and life is short. Some liberty of selection\r\nin testing the hypothesis that seems most probable must be allowed the\r\ninvestigator, and the instinct of genius may sometimes hit on the right\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SKETCH OF THE PROFESSORS OF BOTANY IN EDINBURGH FROM 1670 UNTIL 1887\r\n\r\nBY ISAAC BAYLEY BALFOUR\r\n\r\n  Medicine and Botany--James Sutherland--enforced retirement--the\r\n  Prestons--Charles Alston--his career--John Hope--Physiological\r\n  leanings--Daniel Rutherford--Robert Graham--John Hutton\r\n  Balfour--characteristics--Botanic Society of Edinburgh\r\n  founded--appointed to Glasgow--transfer to Edinburgh--his\r\n  numerous activities--laboratory teaching established--field\r\n  excursions--Ecology--attitude to Darwinism--Alexander Dickson--work\r\n  in Organography--his versatility.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy task in the warring against oblivion typified in these addresses is\r\nto speak about John Hutton Balfour of Edinburgh, one of the botanical\r\nteachers of the middle of last century, whose pupils were numbered by\r\nthousands, and whose active life bridged the period of the passing of\r\nthe old and the birth of the new outlook upon science through Darwin's\r\nwork; and in relation to what I have to say of him I propose to sketch\r\nbriefly the stages and development of botanical teaching in Edinburgh\r\nfrom the date when systematised attention was first given to it.\r\n\r\nOf the well-recognised fact that the study of Botany as a science\r\nhas been, to begin with, dependent on Medicine my story furnishes an\r\nexcellent illustration.\r\n\r\nOnly towards the end of the seventeenth century had the advance in\r\npractice of Medicine in Edinburgh reached a stage which gave urgency\r\nto a movement for the improvement in the training of the medical man,\r\nand the protection of the public from the attentions of inefficient\r\nvotaries of the healing art. The foundation of the Royal College of\r\nPhysicians in 1681 gave expression to the co-operative principle in\r\nthe control of those who would profess Medicine; the creation of a\r\nBotanic Garden for the purpose of the cultivation of medicinal plants\r\nwas the response in the direction of safeguarding the practitioner\r\nagainst the herbalist, and of giving him the advantage of a correct\r\nknowledge of the plants which were the source of the drugs he himself\r\nwas to compound. Before this time, whilst many practitioners could grow\r\ndrug-plants for themselves, and did so, the majority were at the mercy\r\nof the herbalist.\r\n\r\nTwo Edinburgh physicians--(Sir) Robert Sibbald and (Sir) Andrew\r\nBalfour--conspicuous among their fellows for their activity in\r\npromoting the cause of medical education and in the planning of the\r\nRoyal College of Physicians, were the pioneers of the study of Botany\r\nas a science. Determined that the apprentices in Medicine should have\r\nadequate opportunity of learning the sources of many of the drugs in\r\nuse, they acquired a lease of a small area of land in the neighbourhood\r\nof Holyrood Palace in which they arranged to cultivate medicinal\r\nplants, stocking it from their own gardens and from those of friends.\r\nThey secured the services of James Sutherland--described as \"knowing\"\r\nin these matters--and placed their small garden under his care, with\r\nthe obligation that he should instruct the apprentices and lieges in\r\nBotany. Sutherland cultivated his plants so well, and the instruction\r\nwhich he gave was so satisfactory, that ere long--no doubt through\r\nSibbald's influence at Court--a portion of the Royal Flower Garden at\r\nHolyrood Palace was assigned for the cultivation of medicinal plants,\r\nand thither was transferred the collection already made in the hired\r\narea. Thus was founded, with the title of Physick Garden, a Royal\r\nBotanic Garden in Scotland, and the first Profession of Botany was set\r\nup therein by James Sutherland.\r\n\r\nOf the earlier years of Sutherland we have no record. His success as a\r\nteacher induced the Town Council of Edinburgh--the body in which was\r\nvested at the time all the patronage of the University--to institute\r\na Chair of Botany in the University, and to provide for practical\r\nteaching in another Botanic Garden belonging to the town. Sutherland\r\nwas appointed to the Professorship and also to take charge of this\r\nnew Town Garden, which, it may interest those who at the present day\r\npass through the Waverley Railway Station to know, occupied a portion\r\nof the site of that station. Both these gardens were at some distance\r\nfrom the University, and apparently to save the time of the University\r\nstudents, perhaps also to create a teaching garden entirely within the\r\njurisdiction of the College authorities, another portion of ground\r\noccupying a part of the Kirk o' Field, notorious as the place of\r\nDarnley's murder, was transformed into a herb-garden. Thus within a few\r\nyears from the beginning of the movement for the providing of adequate\r\nfacilities to students for learning about plants, three Botanic Gardens\r\nwere made available.\r\n\r\nDuring Sutherland's tenure of the Professorship teaching was given\r\nby him in these different gardens. It would appear, however, that\r\nSutherland was at heart a numismatist, and whilst during the early\r\nperiod of his incumbency of office he had corresponded with many\r\nbotanical institutions abroad, had introduced to the gardens new\r\nspecies of plants--many of them now established in the flora--and had\r\npublished in 1683 a _Catalogue of the plants in the Physical Garden_,\r\nin later years his interest was centred in coins and medals. So great\r\nwas the obsession that the patrons of the University, dissatisfied with\r\nhis botany, compelled him to resign his Chair in 1706, to which they\r\nappointed Charles Preston, but Sutherland retained, until he retired\r\nin 1715, charge of the Royal Botanic Garden at Holyrood, of which by\r\nRoyal Warrant he had been made Keeper with the additional personal\r\nrecognition of Botanist to the King in Scotland. Thus the increase in\r\nnumber of gardens extended to the Professors, and from 1706 onwards to\r\n1739 there were two rival Botanical Schools in Edinburgh--that of the\r\nRoyal Garden, and that of the University.\r\n\r\nSutherland's place in relation to the development of scientific\r\nBotany in Scotland is that of pioneer in the teaching of systematic\r\nBotany from the living plants in relation to Materia Medica, and\r\nof first custodian and cultivator of plants for instruction in a\r\npublic garden. His _Catalogue_ is now a book of some rarity--of great\r\nrarity in complete state owing to the number of cancel pages--and its\r\nreproduction at the present time would have interest alike scientific\r\nand historic. It is the first published record of a collection of\r\ncultivated plants in Scotland. It tells us the plants which were\r\nrecognised as indigenous at its date, and from its record we can by\r\ncorrelation with information otherwise obtainable discover the time of\r\nintroduction to Scotland of alien plants, and thus obtain a basis for\r\ngauging their influence on the native Flora as we know it now.\r\n\r\nCharles Preston who stepped into the University Chair of Botany vacated\r\nin 1706 by Sutherland, was a medical man, an active correspondent of\r\nSloan, Pettiver, and other scientific men in the south. On his death\r\nin 1712, after a short tenure of office, George Preston his brother\r\nsucceeded him and filled the chair until 1739. Both of the Prestons\r\nseem to have been chiefly interested in the Materia Medica side of\r\nBotany and their teaching was on the lines of it. They are referred to\r\nby their contemporaries as men of botanical knowledge and of critical\r\njudgment, and their correspondence indicates that they were in touch\r\nwith the botanical life of their time. Their work in teaching was\r\nalways in rivalry with that at the Royal Physick Garden. At first no\r\ndoubt it was effective and useful owing to Sutherland's neglect of\r\nhis garden, but when a capable active scientific Professor was placed\r\nin charge of this Garden the case for such rivalry and duplication\r\nof effort ceased, and it is no surprise therefore to find that when\r\na vacancy occurred in 1739 the University Chair was filled by the\r\nappointment of the King's Botanist in Charge of the Royal Physick\r\nGarden, who was then Dr Charles Alston. And this combination continues\r\nto our own time by mutual consent of the Crown and the University.\r\n\r\nSutherland's retirement in 1715 from the Royal Physick Garden four\r\nyears before his death, which took place in 1719 when he was over\r\n80 years of age, may have been determined by his incapacity for the\r\nduties, but it is probable other influences were effective especially\r\nas the office of King's Botanist was a Household Appointment and only\r\nduring pleasure. Were I merely to tell of incidents in the history of\r\nBotany in Edinburgh I would here introduce the story of Dr William\r\nArthur, Sutherland's successor at the Royal Garden. Arthur has no\r\nbotanical claims, but had influential political friends whose zeal\r\non his behalf he ill requited by becoming one of the leaders in the\r\nJacobite plot to capture the Castle of Edinburgh in 1715. Having failed\r\nin the attempt he escaped to Italy, where in 1716 he died from a\r\nsurfeit of figs! Ignoble fate for a King's Botanist!\r\n\r\nA man of real distinction now comes into our botanical history in\r\nCharles Alston--a clear observer and experimenter.\r\n\r\nCharles Alston, born 24th October, 1685, was the third son of Thomas\r\nAlston, M.A. of Edinburgh and M.D. of Caen, one of an old Lanarkshire\r\nfamily settled at Thrinacre Milne and connected with the house of\r\nHamilton. After boyhood at Hamilton, Alston went to the University of\r\nGlasgow, but before the period for graduation his father died leaving\r\na widow and large family poorly provided for and young Alston's\r\nUniversity career was stopped. Through the intervention of the Duchess\r\nof Hamilton Alston was then apprenticed in 1703 to a lawyer with a\r\nview to his entering the Estates Office of the Hamilton family. But\r\n\"anatomy and the shops were more agreeable to him than Style Books or\r\nthe Parliament House\" and his \"genius inclined more to Medicine,\" and\r\nin 1709 when the Duchess took him into her service as her \"Principal\r\nServant,\" in which position \"he had aboundance of spare time,\" \"he\r\nply'd close the Mathematics and whatever else he thought of use to a\r\nstudent of Medicine, particularly Botany.\" With this training Alston,\r\nthrough the influence of the Hamilton family, was made King's Botanist,\r\nProfessor of Botany, and Keeper of the Royal Physick Garden in 1716\r\nafter the disappearance of Dr Arthur.\r\n\r\nHe adopted a wise course on succession. Having put the Garden in such\r\norder as he could he hied himself to Leyden in 1718 to study under\r\nBoerhaave, and returning thence in August 1719 he graduated in Medicine\r\nat the University of Glasgow, became Fellow of the Royal College of\r\nPhysicians, and in June 1720 was able to begin his botanical lectures\r\nin the Garden, followed in November by a course on Materia Medica.\r\nThese courses he carried on until 1739 when he was given the University\r\nChair of Botany and Materia Medica, and the two Botany Schools were\r\nthus merged in one. Alston was now colleague of Munro, Rutherford,\r\nSinclair, and other famous men who at this time were increasing the\r\nreputation of the University as a Medical School, and he continued to\r\nteach Botany and Materia Medica until his death in 1760.\r\n\r\nAlston's teaching was mainly directed to the Materia Medica. His\r\nfull course of lectures on the subject prepared for publication by\r\nhimself appeared only as a posthumous work edited by his successor\r\nDr Hope, and they reflect the best knowledge of the time, showing\r\nrational scepticism of the efficacy of many simples which experiment\r\nhad not tested. Essays \"On Opium,\" and \"On tin as anthelmintic,\" and\r\nan \"Index of Simples\" published by him tell of his pharmacological\r\ninvestigations, to which his correspondence with Fothergill and\r\nothers is also witness. The subject in this line to which he gave\r\nmost attention and on which he wrote three dissertations based on\r\nexperiments is that of Quicklime and Water--its efficacy in Calculus\r\nand also as an agent for keeping water sweet. From Alston, Stephen\r\nHales, then in touch with the Admiralty upon questions of ventilation\r\nand other matters of sanitation, obtained early suggestions, and a long\r\ncorrespondence followed.\r\n\r\nAlston, who had to earn his livelihood by medical practice, gave much\r\ntime to the administration of the Botanic Gardens under his charge, and\r\nthe elaborate lists which he prepared showing the disposition of plants\r\nin the Gardens, witness to his interest in their cultivation. His\r\npredilection in systematic arrangement was Tournefortian, and on the\r\npromulgation by Linnaeus of his \"sexual system\" in 1736, no writer was\r\nmore trenchant than Alston in opposition to it, and by this he became\r\nwidely known. His criticism was directed against it, not as a method\r\nof arranging plants by readily recognised characters, but from the\r\nstandpoint of denial of the existence of sex. By various experiments\r\nas well as by argument, Alston endeavoured to disprove the necessity\r\nof the stamens for the development of fertile seed, citing cases of\r\nseed-production where no application of the \"dust\" from the stamens was\r\npossible--thus early recognising conditions which puzzled botanists for\r\nmany generations afterwards and until the explanation of apogamy was\r\nsupplied. One is tempted to wonder whether if the Linnaean system had\r\nnot received the appellation \"sexual\" it would have roused the same\r\ncondemnation from him as it did.\r\n\r\nFrom his published work, notably the _Dissertation on Botany_ (1754)\r\na translation of a portion of his earlier _Tirocinium Botanicum\r\nEdinburgense_ (1740), as also from some MS. of his lectures which still\r\nexist, we recognise the clearness and vigour of mind of Alston, and\r\nthe precision of the man is made abundantly evident in the beautiful\r\ncopper-plate writing in old script of his MS. Page after page is\r\nfilled without blot or correction, and the whole systematised and\r\narranged without flaw. Anatomical questions were dealt with by him in\r\nconsonance with the knowledge of the time, mainly resting on Malpighi;\r\nbut there is no rational treatment of physiological subjects, and this\r\nis the more surprising inasmuch as he was in intimate correspondence\r\nwith Hales, and ought to have been acquainted with the fundamental\r\nexperimental work of that physiologist. It may be that the fragments\r\nof record from which we have to judge are insufficient for correct\r\nappraisement, but on all the evidence we possess we must conclude\r\nthat the two volumes of his _Materia Medica_ give us a picture of the\r\ndirection of his teaching, and that Botany in the hands of its leading\r\nexpositor in Edinburgh was at this period only a hand-maid to Medicine.\r\n\r\nThe advent of Alston's successor, John Hope, was the dawn of new\r\nthings. The influence of the work of Hales had reached Edinburgh.\r\nComparatively few botanists of to-day have heard the name of John\r\nHope otherwise than as that of a correspondent of Linnaeus and\r\nprotagonist in this country of his system of classification, for these\r\nare the claims to distinction assigned to him by the historians of\r\nBritish Botany; and if one reckons the value of a man's life-work in\r\nscience by his published writings alone, that of John Hope would be a\r\nminimum; for only such papers as those \"On Rheum palmatum,\" \"On Ferula\r\nAssafoetida,\" \"On Eriocaulon septangulare in Scotland,\" are extant\r\nfrom his pen. Yet John Hope was a botanist inspired by the spirit of\r\nresearch who obtained by scientific experimental work and explained\r\nto his pupils facts of plant physiology some of which the botanical\r\nworld learned from other workers only a hundred years afterwards. It is\r\ndifficult to account for Hope's reticence. It may be that he intended\r\nto give his work to the world in the book upon Botany which had engaged\r\nhis attention for many years and of which the MS. was in great part\r\nready at the time of his unexpected death in 1786--if so, the botanical\r\nworld has been the poorer through the want of Hope's book.\r\n\r\nBut if Hope did not give cause by published contributions to natural\r\nknowledge for his recognition in promoting the advance of Botany,\r\nhe has always been remembered with gratitude for services of\r\nadministration which he was peculiarly fitted to render and which\r\nprofoundly affected the study of Botany in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nJohn Hope was born 10th May, 1725. The son of Robert Hope, a surgeon\r\nin Edinburgh, whose father had become one of the Senators of the\r\nCollege of Justice with the title of Lord Rankeillour. Educated at a\r\nfamous school in Dalkeith, John Hope, who early showed a liking for\r\nBotany, entered the University of Edinburgh as a medical student and\r\nbecame a pupil of Alston. His botanical inclinations tempted him to\r\nbreak the course of his medical studies in Edinburgh to study Botany\r\nunder Bernard de Jussieu in Paris. Returning to Scotland he graduated\r\nin Medicine from the University of Glasgow in 1750, joined the Royal\r\nCollege of Physicians in Edinburgh and began medical practice,\r\ngiving to Botany such time as could be spared from the many ties of\r\na successful practice. In 1760 Alston died, and John Hope became\r\nhis successor, first of all in 1761 as King's Botanist at Holyrood\r\nand subsequently as Professor of Botany and Materia Medica in the\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nSoon after appointment Hope recognised that to continue to hold\r\n\"colleges\" in Materia Medica meant spoliation of his botanical work.\r\nThe time had come for a separation of the two subjects of Botany and\r\nMateria Medica. Problems of the former now pressing were not those\r\nspecially relating to medicinal plants. He therefore managed to carry\r\nthrough an arrangement by which he retained a chair as Professor\r\nof Medicine and Botany, and a new Professorship of Materia Medica\r\nwas created. The importance of this step for botanical progress was\r\ngreat--it was not merely a question of time occupied but of scientific\r\noutlook.\r\n\r\nAnother movement in the direction of concentration of effort in\r\nthe cause of Botany was initiated by Hope early in his official\r\ncareer--that for the creation of a new Botanic Garden in a locality\r\noutside the immediate influence of town atmosphere, in which the\r\ncollections distributed over the Holyrood and Town Gardens could be\r\ncombined. He accomplished his design, and not only this, but obtained\r\nfrom the Crown a permanent endowment for the new Garden. This was no\r\nsmall achievement--but the omens were favourable, for those patrons\r\nof science the Earl of Bute and, later, the Duke of Portland, were in\r\npower when the Professor made use of the great influence which his\r\nfamily possessed to secure his ends. A spreading city in time made the\r\nlocation of Hope's new Garden unsuitable, and it was transferred to\r\nthe present site; but it was the effort by Hope which gave the Botanic\r\nGarden, and through it Botany, a status among institutions requiring\r\nsubsidy and maintenance by Government in Scotland, and the obligation\r\nso imposed has been upheld notwithstanding an attempt in later years\r\non the part of the Government to get rid of it--an attempt which the\r\nshort-sighted policy of the University nearly allowed to succeed.\r\n\r\nHope's duties in his University Chair required of him, in addition to\r\nhis botanical work, clinical teaching in the Hospital, and he also\r\nengaged in practice--this for a livelihood--and took active share\r\nin the affairs of the Royal College of Physicians, of which he was\r\nPresident at the time of his death, which occurred in 1786. Botany\r\ncould therefore claim but a portion of his time.\r\n\r\nHaving established the new Garden, he laboured with assiduity to lay it\r\nout effectively, and then to enrich it with plants. His own ardour and\r\nenthusiasm impressed others, and his pupils in all parts of the world\r\ncontributed to making the Garden a renowned collection of the rarest\r\nplants. Here Hope met his students, and here he carried out his many\r\nphysiological experiments which gave them instruction.\r\n\r\nHis teaching was comprehensive. Although no longer tied by the calls\r\nof his Materia Medica, Hope did not ignore the subject entirely, but\r\nplants in this relation were not the groundwork of his instruction.\r\nSystematic and descriptive Botany, recognition of herbs, still found\r\na place in it. In Alston the most strenuous opponent of the Linnaean\r\nmethod had gone; it found in Hope a no less strenuous advocate, to\r\nwhose influence its rapid adoption in this country owed much. To what\r\nextent Hope made excursions with his pupils, there is no evidence. His\r\n_Hortus Siccus_ and lists of plants with localities show that he was\r\na field-botanist, and in correspondence with, if not more intimately\r\nacquainted with, the botanists who were working out the Scottish Flora\r\nat the period--such men, for instance, as Lightfoot, Stuart, Robertson.\r\nThis we do know, that he encouraged his pupils to investigate the Flora\r\nof Scotland, giving yearly a gold medal for the best Herbarium, and\r\nHope's \"peripatetic pupils\" is a designation met with in literature of\r\nthe time. This aspect of Hope's teaching, consonant with the features\r\nof the botanical literature of the period, is that which has been\r\ncommonly known. It is not however a complete picture. In Hope Scotland\r\nhad a physiologist of originality and skill--who was not only informed\r\nupon the work of Hales, Duhamel, Mariotte and others, but who made his\r\nown experiments, clearly devised and effective, and whose catholicity\r\nis attested by his dealing with such problems as growth in length and\r\nthickness, effect of light and gravity, movement of water, healing of\r\nwounds, and the like. This physiology was an essential element of his\r\nteaching, and the effect upon students of contact with such direct\r\nwresting of truth from Nature must have been immense. Our knowledge\r\nof all this, only recently acquired, throws a new light upon Hope's\r\ncharacter, and upon the influence which he appears to have exercised\r\non the education of the time. The pity is that he left no published\r\nrecords, and that this bright period of brilliant research should\r\nhave become obscured by the scholasticism inherent in the method of\r\nclassification which he himself did so much to popularise.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with tradition, the Chair vacated by Hope was filled\r\nby the election of another medical practitioner in Edinburgh. Daniel\r\nRutherford was born in Edinburgh 3rd November, 1749, the son of Dr\r\nJohn Rutherford, who as Professor was associated with Alston and\r\nothers in the reformation of the Edinburgh Medical School. He was\r\ndistinguished both as a classical scholar and as a mathematician, and\r\nafter graduating M.A. at the University of Edinburgh, he entered on the\r\nmedical curriculum, obtaining his diploma of M.D. in 1772. His thesis,\r\nwhen applying for the degree, was \"De aero fixo dicto aut Mephitico,\"\r\nand by this he became famous through the distinction he established\r\nin it between carbonic acid gas and nitrogen, though he did not give\r\nnitrogen its name. The exposition he gave of his precise experimental\r\nwork has been allowed to entitle him to be regarded as the discoverer\r\nof nitrogen, although shortly before the appearance of his thesis\r\nPriestley had practically, if less methodically, covered the ground.\r\nAfter graduation, Rutherford travelled in France and Italy, returning\r\nto Edinburgh in 1775 to begin the practice of Medicine, becoming\r\nFellow of the Royal College of Physicians, of which he was afterwards\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nRutherford was a chemist, and I have not discovered in any references\r\nto him expressions that would show he was at this period of his life\r\ninterested in plants otherwise than as objects for his experiments in\r\nrelation to the chemistry of the atmosphere. In seeking for a reason\r\nto explain his selection as Hope's successor in the Chair of Medicine\r\nand Botany, one may suggest either the general one of recognition of\r\nhis scientific ability, or the more special one that in experimenting\r\nwith plants he had been following on the lines of work so conspicuously\r\ndeveloped by Hope. And of course at that time some general knowledge of\r\nBotany had to be the possession of every successful physician.\r\n\r\nLike his predecessors, Rutherford had to undertake clinical teaching\r\nin the Hospital; he maintained also his private practice, and was\r\nkeenly interested in the active literary world of his day in which his\r\nnephew (Sir) Walter Scott was a brilliant star. The Botanic Garden\r\ncontinued to hold its place as a scientific institution, and from\r\nthe advent of William McNab as Principal Gardener in 1810, developed\r\ninto one of the best known in the world. The recording of the plants\r\nof Scotland also proceeded apace; two of the Principal Gardeners of\r\nthe Edinburgh Garden during Rutherford's Keepership--John Mackay\r\nfrom 1800-1802, and George Don from 1802-1806--being foremost in\r\nmaking known its floristic features, and their work Rutherford must\r\nhave encouraged. From MS. notes of his lectures, I gather that the\r\nbiological did not attract Rutherford, nor does it appear in the scanty\r\nrecords available that any special development of teaching equipment or\r\nof method took place during his tenure of office.\r\n\r\nFor some years before his death in 1819 Rutherford had been infirm; and\r\nspeculation as to his successor had been rife. Robert Brown and Sir\r\nJames Edward Smith were both spoken of. When the vacancy came Robert\r\nBrown refused it and Robert Graham, then Professor in the University of\r\nGlasgow, was appointed.\r\n\r\nRobert Graham was born at Stirling 3rd December, 1786, the third son of\r\nDr Robert Graham of Stirling (afterwards Moir of Leckie). After early\r\neducation at Stirling, Graham was apprenticed in 1804 to Mr Andrew\r\nWood, Surgeon in Edinburgh, and entered on the study of Medicine at\r\nthe University, graduating M.D. in 1808. Thereafter he studied at St\r\nBartholomew's Hospital in London for a year before settling in Glasgow,\r\nwhere he was also Lecturer in Clinical Medicine. During this period he\r\npublished a dissertation \"On continued Fever.\"\r\n\r\nBotany in the University of Glasgow at this time had not reached\r\nthe dignity of having a Professorship. It was attached to the Chair\r\nof Anatomy, but a separate lecturer undertook its teaching. To this\r\nlectureship Graham was appointed in succession to Dr Brown. This\r\nappointment was the prelude to his election as Professor in 1818 when\r\nthe Chair of Botany was founded--a foundation which owed much to him\r\nthrough his influence with the Duke of Montrose, then Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity, of whose house he was a cadet. One of the first efforts of\r\nGraham in his new position was directed to the completion of a scheme\r\nthat was making for the formation of a Botanic Garden. In this he\r\nsucceeded, and botanical teaching in Glasgow was thus equipped in 1819.\r\n\r\nFrom this sphere in which he had initiated so much, Graham came to\r\nEdinburgh in 1820 as Professor of Medicine and Botany and was forced\r\nagain to take up medical practice and clinical teaching in the\r\nHospital, and in consequence to interest himself in the affairs of the\r\nRoyal College of Physicians, of which he became President--all this, as\r\nin the case of his predecessors, in addition to his botanical work.\r\n\r\nHis first labour in relation to Botany was to transfer the Botanic\r\nGarden which Hope had made to a new site--that which it now occupies.\r\nNearly two years were required to carry out the removal, to the\r\nsuccess of which the skill of William McNab, the Principal Gardener,\r\ncontributed greatly.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole tenure of his offices Graham devoted himself to\r\nthe affairs of this Garden, and often in the very practical way of\r\nsupplying funds from his own resources to supplement the inadequate\r\ngrants obtained from Government. It gave him the material for the\r\ndescription of many new species which were figured in the _Botanical\r\nMagazine_ and other like periodicals. This systematic botanical work\r\nwas that which Graham cared for most, it was the backbone of his\r\nteaching, and all of his scattered papers deal with this aspect of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn connection with his teaching Graham developed specially the\r\nbotanical excursion for the study of Field Botany, making it an\r\nintegral part of his courses, and in furtherance of its aims travelling\r\nfar through Scotland--a business of a much more arduous nature in days\r\nwhen railways and motors had not annihilated distance and provided\r\nall the comforts of civilisation within easy reach of every district.\r\nGraham had intended to publish a _Flora_ of Scotland as the result of\r\nhis practical study of its plants, but it was uncompleted at the time\r\nof his death in 1845 after an illness of some duration during which\r\n(Sir) Joseph Dalton Hooker acted as _locum tenens_.\r\n\r\nAnother new method in his teaching was that of encouraging students to\r\nwrite essays upon subjects either practical or theoretical. In this he\r\nstimulated investigation. Students in these days had more time than\r\nthey have now to devote to such things, and of their efforts some were\r\nsound pieces of research--the _Botanical Geography_ of Hewitt C. Watson\r\nfirst took form in one of these essays.\r\n\r\nJohn Hutton Balfour[135], who succeeded Graham, was born in Edinburgh\r\n15th September, 1808. The eldest son of Andrew Balfour, surgeon in the\r\nArmy, who afterwards settled in Edinburgh as printer and publisher,\r\nin which business his enterprise was adequate to the venture of the\r\n_Edinburgh Encyclopaedia_ under the editorship of (Sir) David Brewster.\r\nAndrew Balfour was a grim old presbyterian of the stuff covenanters\r\nwere made, and in the strict home environment which he created young\r\nBalfour early came into touch with theological dogma. The echo of these\r\nearly impressions remained with him throughout life.\r\n\r\nEducated at the High School of Edinburgh where he laid the\r\nfoundation of sound classical scholarship--always his unobtrusive\r\ndistinction--Balfour entered the curriculum for the Arts degree at the\r\nUniversity. Before completing this he migrated to St Andrews in order\r\nto be under the influence of Professor Thomas Chalmers--the famous\r\nDivine, afterwards leader in the disruption that founded the Free\r\nChurch of Scotland--in conformity with the desire of his father that\r\nhe should become a minister in the Church of Scotland. But Divinity\r\ndid not claim him and he returned to Edinburgh to begin the study of\r\nMedicine--a decision in face of family pressure which is tribute to\r\nthe strength of purpose which characterised him and found expression\r\nfrequently in after life.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this renewed Edinburgh curriculum Balfour attended\r\nthe Botany course of Professor Graham in 1825, and obtained his first\r\nscientific instruction in Botany--a subject for which he had always\r\nshown fondness. Robert Dickson, afterwards Lecturer on Botany at St\r\nGeorge's Hospital, London, was a fellow-student, and together they,\r\nin this and following years, made many botanical excursions about\r\nEdinburgh. With his fellows Balfour seems to have been _bon camarade_,\r\nacquired all the ephemeral distinction attaching to a facile writer\r\nof rhymed couplets for occasions, and as an inveterate maker of puns\r\nwas in demand for the office of punster at the convivial clubs of\r\nthe period. A mark of more serious attainment--he was President of\r\nthe Royal Medical Society in two years. After graduation as M.D.,\r\nwhen he also became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in\r\nEdinburgh--his thesis for the former being \"De Strychnia,\" for the\r\nlatter \"On Purulent Wounds\"--Balfour went in 1832 to Paris to continue\r\nhis medical education, studying there under Dupuytren, Lisfranc, and\r\nManec. Returning, he settled in Edinburgh in 1834 and entered on\r\npractice, becoming assistant within and without the University to Sir\r\nGeorge Ballingall, Professor of Military Surgery. Amongst his patients\r\nhe numbered De Quincey and his family. De Quincey's eldest son died\r\nfrom a cerebral complaint, and the autopsy revealed an interesting\r\npathological condition which formed the subject of Balfour's\r\ninvestigation, and an account of it his first published scientific\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nFrom the claims of Medicine Balfour could wrest little time for\r\nbotanical pursuits, but his holiday always meant the botanical\r\nexploration of some area, preferably alpine, and his home became a\r\ncentre for men of kindred tastes. There in co-operation with his old\r\nteacher Graham, and with Greville, Forbes, Falconer, Parnell, Munby and\r\nothers, was instituted in 1836 the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, with\r\nwide aims for the promotion of Botany--amongst them the creation of a\r\nbotanical library and a herbarium. This has proved a signal service\r\nto science. It was the pegging out of a claim which has been made\r\neffective. The Society after a life--as with all such societies--of\r\nfluctuating periods of greater and lesser activity, flourishes still,\r\nand its library and herbarium, transferred to the Crown when the space\r\ndemand of their bulk became urgent, have been the foundation for the\r\nlarge botanical library and herbarium now maintained and subsidised by\r\nGovernment in the Royal Botanic Garden.\r\n\r\nPlants gradually drew Balfour away from patients and in 1840 he carried\r\nthe divorce so far as to establish himself as a teacher of Botany\r\nin the Extra-mural Medical School in Edinburgh--that exemplar of\r\nfree-trade in teaching--from which so many of the famous occupants of\r\nChairs in the University have entered its portals. But only in 1842,\r\nwhen Sir William Hooker moved to Kew and a vacancy was then caused in\r\nthe Glasgow Chair of Botany to which Balfour was elected, was he able\r\nto give up medical practice entirely.\r\n\r\nIn Glasgow the first years of Balfour's botanical career were spent,\r\nbut they were few. On the death of Graham he returned to Edinburgh\r\nas Professor of Medicine and Botany and Keeper of the Royal Botanic\r\nGarden--the electors passing over Joseph Dalton Hooker also a\r\ncandidate. In the sphere of these offices the rest of his active life\r\nwas passed until his retirement in 1879. He came to the University\r\nof Edinburgh at a time when the reputation of its medical school was\r\nupheld by a remarkable band of teachers in the Medical Faculty--Allen\r\nThomson, Alison, Christison, Goodsir, Gregory, Jameson, Simpson,\r\nSyme--and when the struggle of the University after a revised\r\nconstitution was approaching the climax reached in 1858, when with\r\nother Scottish Universities Edinburgh obtained autonomy, and science\r\nwas enfranchised. Of this Faculty he became Dean, and held office until\r\nclose upon the time when he became Emeritus. In all the discussions\r\nand controversies, destructive and constructive, that attached to so\r\nweighty a crisis, Balfour's influence and outlook for science were\r\nused with effect, and no less influential were his action and advice\r\nin subsequent years when the specific question of medical reform was\r\nraised, as it so often was.\r\n\r\nAbsorbing administrative work of this kind, to which were soon added\r\nthe duties of a Secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh--(and\r\nhe remained in the Secretariat to the end of his active life)--as\r\nwell as those of an editor of the _Edinburgh New Philosophical\r\nJournal_--(afterwards merged in the _Annals and Magazine of Natural\r\nHistory_)--of Secretary of the Royal Caledonian Horticultural Society\r\nand of other offices, made inroad alike upon time and energy of a man\r\nwho had also the administration of the Royal Botanic Garden in his\r\nhands, as well as the calls of his Professorship of Botany to attend\r\nto. But Balfour was untiring in industry, prompt and precise in method,\r\nand administrative work appealed to him.\r\n\r\nThough liable like his predecessors to undertake clinical medical\r\nteaching, Balfour, save for occasionally acting as _locum tenens_, took\r\nno share in it, and his energies in teaching were devoted to Botany. On\r\nthe lines he followed he was pioneer. We have seen that Field Botany\r\nhad been for several decades a characteristic of the Edinburgh Botanic\r\nSchool. Whilst maintaining this feature, Balfour added laboratory work.\r\nThe word \"laboratory\" was not then in vogue, and \"microscopical room\"\r\nwas the designation of the new domain in which the \"guillotine,\" not\r\nthe \"microtome,\" was used. In the sphere of practical teaching this was\r\na notable advance, and the more so when the technical difficulties that\r\nhad to be overcome are remembered--the days of cheap microscopes were\r\nbut beginning, aniline dyes were not yet. Nevertheless the student of\r\nthe time had opportunity were he so minded of examining plant-form and\r\nplant-structure for himself under direction, and if the equipment for\r\nwork were not so perfect mechanically as modern methods now permit of,\r\nthe training in minute observation was no less excellent than that of\r\nto-day, and the educational effect of the teaching no less valuable.\r\nThe scheme of work was that of the text-books--passing progressively\r\nfrom tissues to organs vegetative and reproductive both phanerogamic\r\nand cryptogamic. The specialisation of the type system had not come.\r\n\r\nBefore he was able to establish, as he did in the early fifties,\r\npractical laboratory classes, Balfour had introduced a system of\r\ndemonstrations of microscopic objects and of physiological experiments\r\nin illustration daily of the subject of his lecture, and it is\r\ntestimony to his power of infusing zeal in pupils that there was\r\nalways a contingent of them ready to come to the Botanic Garden at six\r\no'clock in the morning to give voluntary aid in the arranging of these\r\ndemonstrations for the lecture at eight o'clock. Many of those who came\r\nhave recorded that they found that period and its work one of the most\r\ninspiring in their student history.\r\n\r\nThis new departure in teaching did not interfere with the continuation\r\nand extension of field-work, which up to this time had been the form of\r\npractical study cultivated in Edinburgh. On the contrary the Botanical\r\nExcursion gave Balfour an outlet for energy and favourable opportunity\r\nfor the exercise of those gifts of personal magnetism and intellectual\r\nstimulus through which he influenced and guided many generations of\r\nstudents. Every Saturday during the summer session an excursion was\r\nmade, and one of some days' duration usually brought the session to\r\na close. Through these excursions the greater part of Scotland was\r\ntraversed--on one occasion the terminal excursion of the session was to\r\nSwitzerland--and the features of flora and vegetation were brought to\r\nthe attention of many hundreds of students.\r\n\r\nThe aim and result of the excursion were not solely the acquisition\r\nof plants and their identification. The stimulating effect on many of\r\nthis side of Botany is evidenced even in our day by the zeal with which\r\nsearch after rare plants is pursued, and in the eagerness displayed\r\nin the race after micro-forms. But the enticement of acquisition and\r\ndiscovery of novelty whilst there were not the governing influences\r\nin Balfour's excursion. In touch as he was with the problems of\r\norganography in its fullest sense, a man of wide reading familiar with\r\nthe botanical work of his time, and associated as he had been in the\r\nfield with men like Edward Forbes and Hewett Cottrell Watson, Balfour\r\ncould and did look at plants from the standpoint of their place in\r\nvegetation, and in relation to the conditions of growth, and as having\r\na history in their habitat. His teaching reflected this. It was never\r\nclassification, diagnosis, and nomenclature as the end-all of Botany.\r\nThe details emphasised changed as the progress of botanical discovery\r\ngave new clues to explanation of form and relation, and it was the\r\nsolvings and attempts at solvings of observed phenomena that gave that\r\nfascination to his excursions, the remembrance of which seems to have\r\nclung to those who had the fortune to join them. The succession of\r\nplants and plant-form from base to summit of a highland hill; contrasts\r\nof vegetation of stream-course, mountain pasture, alpine rock; high\r\nmountain forms of shore plants; intrusion and extirpation; factors\r\nof distribution and their influence;--those and other problems of\r\nwhat we now term Ecological Botany were themes on which the Professor\r\ndiscoursed in his rambles, filling the pupil with information and\r\nforcing him to think out to such conclusion as he might on the evidence\r\nbefore him. And then the whole occasion was so enlivened by the outgo\r\nof good humour and mirth in joke and pun and story, that fatigue and\r\nweariness, which the physical exercise might evoke in those less\r\nattuned than the wiry Professor, were drowned in the sunny current of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nI mention this practical teaching first, for it was the characteristic\r\nfeature, but the idea of practical illustration pervaded all Balfour's\r\neffort. His lecture table became a synopsis of the lecture--living\r\nplants, herbarium material, museum specimens, all were pressed into\r\nservice to elucidate the points of the discourse, whilst the walls\r\nwere tapestried by diagrams. Never did teacher more sedulously absorb\r\nthe new for presentation to his pupils. He was a lucid expositor, and,\r\napart from his University lectures, during many years was sought after\r\nfor more popular discourses to non-academic audiences.\r\n\r\nThe period of Balfour's teaching included the momentous year\r\n1860. The impulse of the new spirit introduced by Darwin did not\r\nstimulate Balfour as it might have done a younger man. His religious\r\nbeliefs--always in evidence--were showing then the influence of his\r\nearly environment, and whilst Darwin's work was incorporated in his\r\nteaching, the acceptance of Darwin's theory appeared too near the\r\nnegation of faith. On Balfour indeed, as on others with like views,\r\nthe immediate effect of the _Origin_ was the opposite of vivifying.\r\nIt gave a shock. And this, I conceive, not so much a consequence of\r\nDarwin's own statement of his theory as of the forceful uncompromising\r\nattitude of the chief protagonist of his cause. Arrogance there was\r\non the religious side, but no less also on the scientific side in the\r\ndiscussion. Perhaps it was well that the contest was sharp and bitter.\r\nIt ended sooner, but its course was strewn with misconceptions and with\r\nconfusion of cause and effect. In our days of complete reconciliation,\r\nwhen every tyro lisps in phyletic numbers as the outcome of Darwin's\r\nwork, it is not amiss to recall the struggle at its inception--lest we\r\nforget.\r\n\r\nThe system of Essays which formed so important a part of Graham's\r\nteaching remained as prominent and was even developed further in\r\nBalfour's course in a way which had the inestimable merit of making\r\nthe student feel that his study of plants had a living relationship\r\nwith the everyday concerns of life. Thus when Simpson was engaged\r\nin his epoch-making investigations on anaesthetics, the subject for\r\nan essay was the effect of anaesthetics on sensitive plants, and by\r\nway of emphasis, the prize awarded was a gift by Simpson himself.\r\nSimilarly Balfour enlisted the sympathy of Messrs Lawson, the prominent\r\nagricultural nurserymen of the day, and their prizes for dissection\r\nof grasses, for kinds of cereals, and like subjects, were constant\r\nreminders of the relations of botanical study to agriculture. The\r\nsubjects of essays covered a wide field. The titles--influence of\r\nnarcotic and irritant gases, changes which have taken place in the\r\nFlora of Britain during the historical era, cytogenesis and cell\r\ndevelopment, phanerogamous embryology, cryptogamous reproduction,\r\nteratology--may serve to indicate this, and an essential was always the\r\npractical illustration, microscopic or other.\r\n\r\nFor the use of the students Balfour compiled text-books which, like his\r\nlectures, are comprehensive in the field they cover, and encyclopaedic\r\nin the information they convey. His facile pen found expression too in\r\nnumberless articles in encyclopaedias and magazines, and his activity\r\nas an expositor of botanical topics of the time was unbounded.\r\n\r\nIn the Botanic Garden Balfour obtained the material for the definite\r\ncontributions he made to natural knowledge which are in the domain\r\nof Systematic Botany. No work in which Balfour engaged gave him more\r\ngenuine pleasure than the administration of the Botanic Garden.\r\nEntering on the responsibility of its care when its repute was high,\r\nhe left it on laying down office in even higher reputation, for in the\r\nMcNabs--William and James--father and son--he had lieutenants of the\r\nfirst rank in gardening. During his regime the equipment for laboratory\r\nteaching to which reference has been made was installed, a museum to\r\nwhich old pupils all over the world contributed was instituted, and the\r\nGarden itself trebled in size, the latest addition, made just before\r\nhis retirement, being an area to be cultivated as an arboretum for\r\nstudents of Forestry--a subject then beginning to claim attention.\r\n\r\nWith Balfour's retirement in 1879 the link of Botany with Medicine in\r\nthe University was still further weakened. Medicine was left out of the\r\ntitle of the Chair to which Alexander Dickson succeeded.\r\n\r\nAlexander Dickson of Hartree and Kilbucho was born at Edinburgh, 21st\r\nJuly, 1836. He was the second son of David Dickson of Hartree in\r\nPeeblesshire, and the representative of a family for long lairds of the\r\nestates of which, by the early death of his elder brother, he became\r\nproprietor. Educated privately, he entered the University of Edinburgh\r\nas a student of Medicine, graduating in 1860. Before graduation he had\r\nstudied in Würzburg and in Berlin, particularly under Kölliker and\r\nVirchow, and after it he embarked on the stream of medical practice in\r\nEdinburgh. But that was convention--a demonstration of brass plate. His\r\nmeans placed him beyond the necessity of such professional work. His\r\ninstinct lay in the direction of discovery of method more than in its\r\napplication. During his student days he had shown a keen interest in\r\nBotany. Before graduation he had written on botanical subjects, and his\r\nthesis on graduation \"The development of the flower in Caryophyllaceae\"\r\nwitnesses to his obsession. Whilst waiting for patients, he had\r\ncontinued work on embryogeny in plants, and when in 1862 the ill\r\nhealth of Professor Dickie at Aberdeen required the appointment of\r\na substitute, the selection of Dickson set seal to his claims as\r\na professed Botanist. In 1866 he succeeded Harvey as Professor in\r\nDublin. Thence in 1868 he was translated to Glasgow as successor to\r\nWalker-Arnott, and in 1879 became Professor of Botany and Queen's\r\nBotanist in Edinburgh on the retirement of Balfour, and, holding these\r\npositions, he died in 1887.\r\n\r\nDickson's passion was not teaching, and his success is testimony to\r\nthe quality of the man. He was adored by his students, as could not\r\nwell be otherwise with a man of his geniality and kindliness; he took\r\nimmense pains over his lectures, spending hours daily over the making\r\nof fresh drawings on the blackboard for his classes, holding that a\r\nstudent would copy a temporary sketch although he would not copy a\r\npermanent wall-diagram; the lecture itself was a model of scientific\r\npresentment; at excursions he was untiring in demonstration and in\r\nfruitful suggestion, and he was always ready to give of his best to\r\nhis pupils; but his real love was for research and he carried out\r\nmany organographical investigations which have added to the sum of\r\nnatural knowledge. His record in published papers far exceeds that of\r\nany of his predecessors, and the quality of his work recalls that of\r\nIrmisch. Flower-morphology, embryogeny, teratology, were the subjects\r\nto which he gave most attention in research, and in them he obtained\r\nresults of solid and permanent value. For a time the subject of\r\nphyllotaxy occupied him, but it is not a fruitful theme although it\r\ngave him opportunity for showing his power of clear analysis; much more\r\ninteresting was his subsequent work on pitcher plants of kinds.\r\n\r\nDickson possessed great skill in manipulation, and was strikingly\r\neffective in the use of his pencil in artistic delineation of the\r\nobjects of his investigation. Careful in his work he took endless pains\r\nto secure that accuracy which it always shows. Further, his subject is\r\nalways illumined by the comparative method of treatment which his wide\r\nknowledge and sound critical faculty enabled him to bring to bear upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe duties of his lairdship were no light ones to Dickson who had set\r\nhimself to build up again what had come to him in an impoverished\r\ncondition, and affairs of Church and State were a very real interest to\r\nhim. Amidst all these ties, to which has to be added the administration\r\nof the Botanic Garden, in which during his tenure a new and enlarged\r\nLecture Hall was built, he found time to cultivate the musical faculty\r\nfor which he was distinguished; not only was he a pianist of mark, but\r\nhe found absorbing zest in the collecting of national airs sung by the\r\npeasants of Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn the line of Professors of Botany in Edinburgh no one ranked higher\r\nin distinction than Alexander Dickson, with whose name I conclude this\r\nsketch.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[135] His portrait forms the frontispiece of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JOSEPH DALTON HOOKER\r\n\r\n1817-1911\r\n\r\nBY F. O. BOWER.\r\n\r\n  His long life--childhood and education--travels--Geological\r\n  work--Morphological Memoirs--administrative duties--systematic\r\n  works--relations with Darwin--acceptance of Mutability of\r\n  Species--his philosophical Essays--their influence in advancing\r\n  Evolutionary Belief.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult task to condense within suitable limits an\r\nappreciation of so long and strenuous a life as that of Sir Joseph\r\nHooker. Naturally with age the bodily strength waned, but the vivid\r\nmind remained unimpaired to the end. He even continued his detailed\r\nobservations till very shortly before his death in December, 1911. The\r\nlist of his published works extends from 1837 to 1911, a record hardly\r\nto be equalled in any walk of intellectual life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate XXVI_ SIR JOSEPH DALTON HOOKER\r\n\r\n(From the photograph by Mrs Cameron, 1868)]\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Hooker was born at Halesworth, in Suffolk, in 1817. His\r\nfather, Sir William Hooker, brought him to Glasgow as a child of four\r\nyears of age, when he entered on his duties as Professor of Botany\r\nin 1821. The Professor established himself in Woodside Crescent,\r\nconveniently near to the Botanic Garden, then but recently established,\r\nbut developing under his hands with wonderful rapidity. Doubtless his\r\nlittle son was familiar with it and its contents from childhood. He\r\ngrew up in an atmosphere surcharged with the very science he was to\r\ndo so much to advance. His father's home was the scene of manifold\r\nactivities. It housed a rapidly growing herbarium and museum. It was\r\nthere that the drawings were made to illustrate that amazing stream of\r\ndescriptive works which Sir William was then producing. New species\r\nmust have been almost daily under examination, often as living\r\nspecimens. Between the garden and the house the boy must have witnessed\r\nconstantly, during the most receptive years of childhood, the working\r\nof an establishment that was at the time without its equal in this\r\ncountry, or probably in any other. The eye and the memory must have\r\nbeen trained almost unconsciously. A knowledge of plants would be\r\nacquired as a natural consequence of the surroundings, and without the\r\neffort entailed by study in later years. Few ever have known, or ever\r\nwill know, plants as he did. Such knowledge comes only from growing up\r\nwith them from earliest childhood.\r\n\r\nSide by side with this almost unconscious education in Botany the\r\nordinary curriculum of school and of college was pursued. There is\r\nno record of academic successes either at the High School, or at the\r\nUniversity of Glasgow, beyond a prize \"for the best Essay on the Brain\r\nand Nerves,\" in 1836. But the following year saw his first publication:\r\nfor he described, while still a student, three new species of Mosses.\r\nIt may be remarked that, like his father, his first writings related\r\nto the lower Plants. He never lost his interest in them, though in\r\nlater years duty diverted him to the study of the Flowering Plants. An\r\nincident of his student period, which he himself relates, is, however,\r\na more clear indication of the life that was to follow than any early\r\npublication of new species. He tells how an opportunity was given\r\nhim of reading the proofs of Darwin's _Voyage of the Beagle_. \"I was\r\nhurrying on my studies (that is for the final examination in Medicine)\r\n... and so pressed for time was I that I used to sleep with the sheets\r\nof 'The Journal' under my pillow, that I might read them between waking\r\nand rising. They impressed me profoundly, whilst they stimulated me to\r\nenthusiasm in the desire to travel and observe.\" The opportunity came\r\nto him almost at once in the four years' voyage to the Antarctic. At\r\nthe age of 22, having passed his examinations, and graduated as M.D.,\r\nhe was equipped at every necessary point for his duties as Assistant\r\nSurgeon and Botanist in the \"Erebus,\" then about to start, along with\r\nthe \"Terror,\" on the famous voyage under the command of Sir James Clark\r\nRoss.\r\n\r\nNo attempt will here be made to give any consecutive biographical\r\nsketch of Sir Joseph Hooker. Several such have already appeared. The\r\ninterest of the reader will be more readily engaged by indicating\r\nthe various lines of activity in which he excelled. He was never a\r\nprofessional teacher, except for a short period of service as deputy\r\nfor Graham in Edinburgh. There was a moment when he might have been\r\nProfessor in Edinburgh, but it passed. He left no pupils, except in\r\nthe sense that all botanists have learned from him through his books.\r\nWe shall contemplate him rather as a Traveller and Geographer, as a\r\nGeologist, as a Morphologist, as an Administrator, as a Scientific\r\nSystematist, and above all as a Philosophical Biologist. He played each\r\nof these several parts in the Drama of Science. The endeavour will be\r\nmade, however imperfectly, to touch upon them all.\r\n\r\nThe experiences of Hooker as a _traveller_ began immediately after\r\ntaking his degree, with his commission in 1839 as Assistant Surgeon\r\nand Botanist in the \"Erebus.\" Scientific Exploration was still in its\r\nheroic age. Darwin was only three years back from the voyage of the\r\n\"Beagle.\" We may well hold the years from 1831, when the \"Beagle\"\r\nsailed, to 1851, when Hooker returned from his Indian journey, or 1852,\r\nwhen Wallace returned from the Amazon, to have been its golden period.\r\nCertainly it was if we measure by results. Unmatched opportunity for\r\ntravel in remote and unknown lands was then combined with unmatched\r\ncapacity of those who engaged in it. Nor was this a mere matter of\r\nchance. For Darwin, Wallace, and Hooker all seized, if they did not in\r\nsome measure make, their opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe intrepid Ross, with his two sailing ships, the \"Erebus\" and the\r\n\"Terror,\" probed at suitable seasons during four years the extreme\r\nsouth. The very names of the Great Ice Barrier, M'Murdo Sound, Mount\r\nErebus and Mount Terror, made familiar to us by adventures seventy\r\nyears later under steam, remain to mark some of his additions to the\r\nmap of the world. Young Hooker took his full share of risks, up to\r\nthe point of being peremptorily ordered back on one occasion by his\r\ncommanding officer. To his activity and willingness, combined with\r\nan opportunity that can never recur in the same form, is due that\r\ngreat collection of specimens, and that wide body of fact which he\r\nacquired. On the outward and return voyages, or in the intervals\r\nwhen the season was not favourable for entering the extreme southern\r\nseas, the expedition visited Ascension, St Helena, the Cape, New\r\nZealand, Australia, Tasmania, Kerguelen Island, Tierra del Fuego, and\r\nthe Falkland Islands. The prime object of the voyage was a magnetic\r\nsurvey, and this determined its course. But it brought this secondary\r\nconsequence; that Hooker had the chance of observing and collecting\r\nupon all the great circumpolar areas of the southern hemisphere. The\r\nresults he later welded together into his first great work, _The\r\nAntarctic Flora_.\r\n\r\nVery soon after his return from the Antarctic the craving for travel\r\nbroke out afresh in him. He longed to see a tropical Flora in a\r\nmountainous country, and to compare it at different levels with that\r\nof temperate and arctic zones. Two alternatives arose before him:\r\nthe Andes and the Himalaya. He chose the latter, being influenced by\r\npromises of assistance from Dr Falconer, the Superintendent of the\r\nCalcutta Garden. But before he left England his journey came under the\r\nrecognition of Government. He not only received grants on the condition\r\nthat the collections made should be located in the Herbarium at Kew,\r\nbut he was accredited by the Indian Government to the Rulers, and the\r\nBritish Residents, in the countries whose hitherto untrodden ways he\r\nwas to explore. After passing the cold season of 1848 in making himself\r\nacquainted with the vegetation of the plains and hills of Western\r\nBengal, he struck north to the Sikkim Himalaya. Hither he had been\r\ndirected by Lord Auckland and by Dr Falconer, as to ground unbroken\r\nby traveller or naturalist. The story of this remarkable journey,\r\nits results and its vicissitudes, including the forcible detention\r\nof himself and his companion Dr Campbell by a faction of the Court\r\nof Sikkim, is to be found in his _Himalayan Journals_. These most\r\nfascinating volumes of travel were published in 1854. They tell how he\r\nspent two years in the botanical exploration and topographical survey\r\nof the state of Sikkim, and of a number of the passes leading into\r\nThibet; and how towards the close of 1848 he even crossed the western\r\nfrontier of Sikkim, and explored a portion of Nepal that has never\r\nsince been open to travellers. In 1849 he returned to Darjeeling,\r\nand busied himself with arranging his vast collections. Here he was\r\njoined by an old fellow-student of Glasgow, Dr Thomas Thomson, son of\r\nthe professor of that name. The two friends spent the year 1850 in the\r\nbotanical investigation of Eastern Bengal, Chittagong, Silhet, and the\r\nKhasia hills. In 1851 they returned together to England.\r\n\r\nThe botanical results of these Indian journeys were immense, and they\r\nprovided the material for much of Hooker's later scientific writing.\r\nNearly 7000 species of Indian plants were collected by these two\r\nGlasgow graduates. But Hooker was not a mere specialist. His _Journals_\r\nare full of other observations, ethnographical, ornithological, and\r\nentomological. His topographical results especially were of the\r\nhighest importance. They formed the basis of a map published by the\r\nIndian Topographical Survey. By the aid of it the operations of\r\nvarious campaigns and political missions have since been carried to a\r\nsuccessful issue. If he were not known as a Botanist, he would still\r\nhave his assured place as a Geographer.\r\n\r\nAfter his return from India, nine years ensued of quiet work at\r\nhome. But in 1860 Hooker took part in a scientific visit to Syria\r\nand Palestine, ascending Mount Lebanon, where he specially paid\r\nattention to the decadent condition of the Cedars, his observations\r\nleading later to a general discussion of the genus. Again a period\r\nof ten years intervened, his next objective being Morocco. In 1871,\r\nwith Mr Ball and Mr Maw, he penetrated the Atlas Range, never before\r\nexamined botanically. His last great journey was in 1877, when he was\r\nsixty years of age. With his old friend, Prof. Asa Gray of Harvard,\r\nhe visited Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra\r\nNevada, and California. Prof. Coulter of Chicago, who was one of the\r\nparty in the Rockies, has told me how difficult it was to round up the\r\ntwo elderly enthusiasts to camp at night.\r\n\r\nThis is an extraordinary record of travel, especially so when we\r\nremember that all the journeys were fitted into the intervals of an\r\notherwise busy life of scientific work and administration. At one time\r\nor another he had touched upon every great continental area of the\r\nearth's surface. Many isolated islands had also been examined by him,\r\nespecially on the Antarctic voyage. Not only were fresh regions thus\r\nopened up for survey and collection, but each objective of the later\r\njourneys was definitely chosen for scientific reasons. Each expedition\r\nhelped to suggest or to solve major problems. Such problems related\r\nnot only to the distribution, but also to the very origin of species.\r\nDarwin saw this with unerring judgment as early as 1845. Hooker was\r\nthen but twenty-eight years old, and the records of the Antarctic\r\nvoyage were only in preparation. Nevertheless Darwin wrote with full\r\nassurance in a letter to Hooker himself: \"I know I shall live to see\r\nyou the first authority in Europe on that grand subject, that almost\r\nkeystone of the laws of Creation, Geographical Distribution.\" Never\r\nwas a forecast more fully justified. But that position, which Hooker\r\nundoubtedly had, could only have been attained through his personal\r\nexperience as a traveller. Observation at first hand was the foundation\r\nupon which he chiefly worked. Hooker the traveller prepared the way for\r\nHooker the philosopher.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Hooker would probably have declined to consider himself\r\nas a _Geologist_. He was, however, for some eighteen months official\r\nBotanist to the Geological Survey of Great Britain. He was appointed\r\nin April 1846, but relinquished the post in November 1847 in order to\r\nstart on his Himalayan journey. During that short period three Memoirs\r\nwere published by him on Plants of the Coal Period. They embodied\r\nresults derived from the microscopic examination of plant-tissues\r\npreserved in Coal Balls, a study then newly introduced by Witham, and\r\nadvanced by Mr Binney. It has since been greatly developed in this\r\ncountry. Such studies were continued by him at intervals up to 1855.\r\nWhile he was thus among the first to engage in this branch of enquiry,\r\nhe may be said to have originated another line of study, since largely\r\npursued by geologists. For he examined samples of diatomaceous ooze\r\nfrom the ocean-floor of the Antarctic, and so initiated the systematic\r\ntreatment of the organic deposits of the deep sea. Yet another branch\r\nof geological enquiry was advanced by him in the Himalaya. For there\r\nhe made observations on the glaciers of that great mountain chain,\r\nhis notes supplying valuable material to both Lyell and Darwin. He\r\nalso accumulated valuable data concerning the stupendous effects of\r\nsub-aerial denudation at great elevations. His latest contribution of\r\na geological character was in 1889, when he returned to an old problem\r\nof his youth, the Silurian fossil _Pachytheca_. But he had to leave the\r\nquestion of its nature still unsolved. This geological record is not an\r\nextensive one. But the quality and rapidity of the work showed that it\r\nwas the time and opportunity and not the faculties that were wanting.\r\nMoreover, it is worthy of remark that the problems he handled were all\r\nnascent at the time he worked upon them.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sir Joseph Hooker's memoirs which deal _morphologically_\r\nwith more limited subjects than is possible in floristic works, is a\r\nrestricted one. In 1856 he produced a monograph on the Balanophoraceae,\r\nbased upon collections of material from the most varied sources. It\r\nis still an authority very widely quoted on these strange parasites.\r\nIn 1859 he described the development and structure of the Pitchers\r\nof _Nepenthes_, while the physiological significance of these, and\r\nother organs of carnivorous plants, formed the subject of an Address\r\nbefore the British Association at Belfast, in 1874. And in 1863 his\r\ngreat monograph appeared upon that most remarkable of all Gymnospermic\r\nplants, _Welwitschia_. These works bore the character of a later period\r\nthan the time when they were produced. In Britain, between 1840 and\r\n1875, investigation in the laboratory, by microscopic analysis of\r\ntissues, was almost throttled by the overwhelming success of systematic\r\nand descriptive work. The revival of investigation in the laboratory\r\nrather than that in the herbarium dates from about 1875. But we see\r\nthat Hooker was one of the few who, prior to that revival, pursued\r\ncareful microscopic analysis side by side with systematic and floristic\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe noble establishment of the Royal Gardens at Kew is often spoken of\r\nas the Mecca of Botanists. It is also the Paradise of the populace of\r\nLondon. It was the Hookers, father and son, who made Kew what it is.\r\nWhen we contemplate Sir Joseph as an _administrator_, we immediately\r\nthink of the great establishment which he and his father ruled during\r\nthe first half century of its history as a public institution. Kew had\r\nexisted for long as a Royal Appanage before it was handed over to the\r\nNation. The Botanic Garden had, indeed, ranked for upwards of half a\r\ncentury as the richest in the world. But after the death of King George\r\nIII. it had retrograded scientifically. On the accession of Queen\r\nVictoria a revision of the Royal Household had become necessary. It\r\nwas then decided to transfer the garden to the Commissioners of Woods\r\nand Forests. This took place in 1840, and in 1841 Sir William Hooker,\r\nwho was then Professor in Glasgow, was appointed the first Director.\r\nThe move to Kew, whither he took his private Library, Herbarium, and\r\nMuseum, was carried out in the absence of his son, who was still in\r\nthe Antarctic. It was not till the Himalayan journey was over in 1851\r\nthat Sir Joseph settled at Kew, his great collections having already\r\nbeen consigned there by agreement with the Government. In 1855 he was\r\nappointed assistant to his father in the Directorship. Finally, he\r\nbecame himself Director on his father's death in 1865, and he held the\r\nposition for twenty years.\r\n\r\nSo long associated together, it is difficult to disentangle the parts\r\nthat father and son actually played in the creation of Kew as it now\r\nis. Nor is there need to attempt it. The original area of the Garden\r\nat Kew was less than 20 acres. But in 1855, when Sir Joseph joined his\r\nfather in the directorate, it had grown by successive additions to 70\r\nacres. Finally, the large area of 650 acres came under the Director's\r\ncontrol. Numerous large glass houses were built. Three Museums\r\nwere established, and the vast Herbarium and Library founded and\r\ndeveloped. The Garden Staff rose to more than 100 men. The day-by-day\r\nadministration of such an establishment would necessarily make great\r\ndemands upon the time, energy, tact, and skill of its official head.\r\nBut in addition there was the growing correspondence to be attended\r\nto, on the one hand with botanists all over the world, on the other\r\nwith the Government Departments, and especially with the Indian and\r\nColonial Offices. As the activity of the Garden extended, there grew up\r\na large staff of scientific experts and artists, whose duties centred\r\nround the Herbarium and Library. These all looked to the Director for\r\ntheir guidance and control. The descriptive work prepared by them for\r\npublication took formidable dimensions. The production of the Floras\r\nof India, and of the Colonies, the publication of which was conducted\r\nunder Government subvention, had to be organised and carried through.\r\nThese matters are mentioned here so as to give some idea of the extent\r\nand complexity of the work which was being carried on at Kew. For ten\r\nyears as Assistant Director, and for twenty years as Director, Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker guided this complex machine. The efficiency of his rule\r\nwas shown by the increasing estimation in which the Garden was held by\r\nall who were able to judge.\r\n\r\nIt was the founding of the Herbarium and Library at Kew which, more\r\nthan anything else, strengthened the scientific establishment. As taken\r\nover from the Crown the Garden possessed neither. But Sir William\r\nbrought with him from Glasgow his own collections, already the most\r\nextensive in private hands. For long years after coming to Kew he\r\nmaintained and added to his store at his own expense. But finally his\r\ncollections were acquired after his death by Government. His Herbarium\r\nwas merged with the fine Herbarium of Bentham, already presented to the\r\nnation in 1857. Thus, the opening years of Sir Joseph's directorate\r\nsaw the organisation upon a public basis of that magnificent Herbarium\r\nand Library, which now contains not only his father's collections, but\r\nalso his own. Among the enormous additions since made to the Herbarium\r\nof Kew, its greatest interest will always be centred in the Hookerian\r\ncollections which it contains.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that such drafts as these upon the time and\r\nenergies of a scientific man would leave no opportunity for other\r\nduties. But it was while burdened with the directorship that Sir\r\nJoseph was called to the highest administrative office in science in\r\nGreat Britain. He served as President of the Royal Society from 1873\r\nto 1878. The obligations of that position are far from being limited\r\nto the requirements of the Society itself. The Government of the day\r\nhas always been in the habit of taking its president and officials\r\ninto consultation in scientific matters of public importance. In these\r\nyears the administrative demands upon Sir Joseph were the greatest\r\nof his life. They are marked by a temporary pause in the stream of\r\npublication. None of his own larger works belong to this period.\r\nIt happens only too often in this country that our ablest men are\r\nthus paralysed in their scientific careers by the potent vortex of\r\nadministration. Not a few succumb, and cease altogether to produce.\r\nThey are caught as in the eddy of the Lorelei, and are so hopelessly\r\nentangled that they never emerge again. They fail to realise, or\r\nrealise too late, that the administration of matters relating to a\r\nscience is not an end in itself, but only a means to an end. Some,\r\nthe steadfast and invincible seekers after truth, though held by the\r\neddy for a time, pass again into the main stream. Hooker was one of\r\nthese. The Presidency of the Royal Society ended at the usual term of\r\nfive years. Seven years later he demitted office as Director of Kew.\r\nHe was thus free in 1885, still a young man in vigour though not in\r\nyears. For over a quarter of a century after retirement he devoted the\r\nenergy of his old age to peculiarly fruitful scientific work. Thus the\r\nadministrative tie upon him was only temporary. So long as it lasted he\r\nfaithfully obeyed the call of duty, notwithstanding the restrictions it\r\nimposed.\r\n\r\nNo exhaustive catalogue need be given of the works upon which the\r\nreputation of Sir Joseph Hooker as a _scientific systematist_ was\r\nfounded. It must suffice briefly to consider his four greatest\r\nsystematic works, _The Antarctic Flora_, _The Flora of British India_,\r\n_The Genera Plantarum_, and the _Index Kewensis_.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how on the Antarctic voyage Hooker had the opportunity\r\nof collecting on all the great circumpolar areas of the Southern\r\nHemisphere. His _Antarctic Flora_ was based on the collections\r\nand observations then made. It was published in six large quarto\r\nvolumes. The first related to the Lord Auckland and Campbell Islands\r\n(1843-1845); the second to Fuegia and the Falkland Islands (1845-1847);\r\nthe third and fourth to New Zealand (1851-1853); and the fifth and\r\nsixth to Tasmania (1853-1860). They describe about 3000 species,\r\nwhile on 530 plates 1095 species are depicted, usually with detailed\r\nanalytical drawings. But these volumes did not merely contain reports\r\nof explorations, or descriptions of the many new species collected.\r\nThere is much more than this in them. All the known facts that could\r\nbe gathered were incorporated, so that they became systematically\r\nelaborated and complete Floras of the several countries. Moreover,\r\nin the last of them, the _Flora Tasmaniae_, there is an Introductory\r\nEssay, which in itself would have made Hooker famous. We shall return\r\nto this later. Meanwhile we recognise that the publication of the\r\n_Botanical Results of Ross's Voyage_ established Hooker's reputation as\r\na Traveller and Botanist of the first rank.\r\n\r\nWhat he did for the Antarctic in his youth he continued in mature life\r\nfor British India. While the publication of the _Antarctic Flora_ was\r\nstill in progress, he made his Indian journeys. The vast collections\r\namassed by himself and Dr Thomson were consigned by agreement with\r\nGovernment to Kew. Thither had also been brought in 1858 \"seven\r\nwaggon-loads of collections from the cellars of the India House in\r\nLeadenhall Street, where they had been accumulating for many years.\"\r\nThey included the herbaria of Falconer and Griffith. Such materials,\r\nwith other large additions made from time to time, flowed into the\r\nalready rich Herbarium at Kew. This was the material upon which Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker was to base his _Magnum Opus_, the _Flora of British\r\nIndia_.\r\n\r\nAlready in 1855 Sir Joseph, with his Glasgow college friend, Thomas\r\nThomson, had essayed to prepare a \"Flora Indica.\" It never advanced\r\nbeyond its first volume. But if it had been completed on the scale\r\nset by that volume, it would have reached nearly 12,000 pages! After\r\na pause of over fifteen years Hooker made a fresh start, aided now by\r\na staff of collaborators, and the _Flora of British India_ was the\r\nresult. It was conceived, he says with regret, upon a restricted plan.\r\nNevertheless it ran to seven volumes, published between the years\r\n1872 and 1897. There are nearly 6000 pages of letterpress, relating\r\nto 16,000 species. It is, he says in the Preface, a pioneer work, and\r\nnecessarily incomplete. But he hopes it may \"help the phytographer to\r\ndiscuss problems of distribution of plants from the point of view of\r\nwhat is perhaps the richest, and is certainly the most varied botanical\r\narea on the surface of the globe.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely was this great work ended when Dr Trimen died. He left the\r\n_Ceylon Flora_, on which he had been engaged, incomplete. Three\r\nvolumes were already published, but the fourth was far from finished,\r\nand the fifth hardly touched. The Ceylon Government applied to Hooker,\r\nand though he was now eighty years of age, he responded to the call.\r\nThe completing volumes were issued in 1898 and 1900. This was no mere\r\nraking over afresh the materials worked already into the _Indian\r\nFlora_. For Ceylon includes a strong Malayan element in its vegetation.\r\nIt has, moreover, a very large number of endemic species, and even\r\ngenera. This last floristic work of Sir Joseph may be held fitly to\r\nround off his treatment of the Indian Peninsula. His last contribution\r\nto its botany was in the form of a \"Sketch of the Vegetation of the\r\nIndian Empire,\" including Ceylon, Burma, and the Malay Peninsula.\r\nIt was written for the _Imperial Gazetteer_, at the request of the\r\nGovernment of India. No one could have been so well qualified for this\r\nas the veteran who had spent more than half a century in preparation\r\nfor it. It was published in 1904, and forms the natural close to the\r\nmost remarkable study of a vast and varied Flora that has ever been\r\ncarried through by one ruling mind.\r\n\r\nThe third of the systematic works selected for our consideration is the\r\n_Genera Plantarum_. It was produced in collaboration with Mr Bentham.\r\nOf its three massive volumes the first was published in 1865, and the\r\nwork was completed in 1883. It consists of a codification of the Latin\r\ndiagnoses of all the genera of Flowering Plants. It is essentially a\r\nwork for the technical botanist, but for him it is indispensable. Of\r\nthe known species of plants many show such close similarity of their\r\ncharacters that their kinship is recognised by grouping them into\r\ngenera. In order that these genera may be accurately defined it is\r\nnecessary to have a _précis_ of the characters which their species have\r\nin common. This must be so drawn that it shall also serve for purposes\r\nof diagnosis from allied genera. Such drafting requires not only a keen\r\nappreciation of fact, but also the verbal clearness and accuracy of the\r\nconveyancing barrister. The facts could only be obtained by access to\r\na reliable and rich Herbarium. Bentham and Hooker, working together at\r\nKew, satisfied these drastic requirements more fully than any botanists\r\nof their time. The only real predecessors of this monumental work were\r\nthe _Genera Plantarum_ of Linnaeus (1737-1764) and of Jussieu (1789),\r\nto which may be added that of Endlicher (1836-1840). But all of these\r\nwere written while the number of known genera and species was smaller.\r\nThe difficulty of the task of Bentham and Hooker was greatly enhanced\r\nby their wider knowledge. But their _Genera Plantarum_ is on that\r\naccount a nearer approach to finality. Hitherto its supremacy has not\r\nbeen challenged.\r\n\r\nThe fourth of the great systematic works of Hooker mentioned above\r\nwas the _Index Kewensis_. It was produced upon the plan and under the\r\nsupervision of Sir Joseph by Dr Daydon Jackson and a staff of clerks.\r\nThe publication began in 1893, and successive supplements to its four\r\nquarto volumes are still appearing at intervals. The expense was borne\r\nby Charles Darwin. The scheme originated in the difficulty he had\r\nfound in the accurate naming of plants. For \"synonyms\" have frequently\r\nbeen given by different writers to the same species, and this had led\r\nto endless confusion. The object of the _Index_ was to provide an\r\nauthoritative list of all the names that have been used, with reference\r\nto the author of each and to its place of publication. The habitat of\r\nthe plant was also to be given. The correct name in use according to\r\ncertain well-recognised rules of nomenclature was to be indicated by\r\ntype different from that of the synonyms superseded by it. The only\r\npredecessor of such an Index was Steudel's _Nomenclator Botanicus_,\r\na book greatly prized by Darwin, though long out of date. He wished\r\nat first to produce a modern edition of Steudel's _Nomenclator_. This\r\nidea was, however, amended, and it was resolved to construct a new\r\nlist of genera and species, founded upon Bentham and Hooker's _Genera\r\nPlantarum_. Sir Joseph Hooker was asked by Mr Darwin to take into\r\nconsideration the extent and scope of the proposed work, and to suggest\r\nthe best means of having it executed. He undertook the task, and it\r\nwas he who laid out the lines to be followed. After years of labour by\r\nDr Daydon Jackson and his staff, the work was produced. But Sir Joseph\r\nread and narrowly criticised all the proofs. Imagine four large quarto\r\nvolumes, containing in the aggregate 2500 pages, each page bearing\r\nthree columns of close print, and each column about fifty names. The\r\ntotal figures out to about 375,000 specific names, all of which were\r\ncritically considered by the octogenarian editor! Surely no greater\r\ntechnical benefit was ever conferred upon a future generation by the\r\nveterans of science than this _Index_. It smooths the way for every\r\nsystematist who comes after. It stands as a monument to an intimate\r\nfriendship. It bears witness to the munificence of Darwin, and the\r\nungrudging personal care of Hooker.\r\n\r\nBut the author of great works such as these was still willing to help\r\nthose of less ambitious flights. I must not omit to mention two books\r\nwhich, being more modest in their scope, have reached the hands of many\r\nin this country. In 1870 Hooker produced his _Students' Flora of the\r\nBritish Islands_, of which later editions appeared in 1878 and 1884.\r\nIt was published in order to \"supply students and field botanists with\r\na fuller account of the plants of the British Isles than the manuals\r\nhitherto in use aim at giving.\" In 1887 he edited, after the death of\r\nits author, the fifth edition of Bentham's _Handbook of the British\r\nFlora_. Both of these still hold the field, though they require to be\r\nbrought up to date in point of classification and nomenclature.\r\n\r\nThe object of these brief sketches of four of the great systematic\r\nworks of Sir Joseph Hooker has been to show how fully he was imbued\r\nwith the old systematic methods: how he advanced, improved and extended\r\nthem, and was in his time their chief exponent. His father had held a\r\nsimilar position in the generation before him. But the elder Hooker,\r\ntrue to his generation, treated his species as fixed and immutable. He\r\ndid not generalise from them. His end was attained by their accurate\r\nrecognition, delineation, description, and classification. The younger\r\nHooker, while in this work he was not a whit behind the best of his\r\npredecessors, saw further than they. He was not satisfied with the mere\r\nrecord of species as they were. He sought to penetrate the mystery\r\nof the origin of species. In fact, he was not merely a Scientific\r\nSystematist in the older sense. He was a _Philosophical Biologist_\r\nin the new and nascent sense of the middle period of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. He was an almost life-long friend of Charles Darwin. He was\r\nthe first confidant of his species theory, and, excepting Wallace,\r\nits first whole-hearted adherent. But he was also Darwin's constant\r\nand welcome adviser and critic. Well indeed was it for the successful\r\nlaunch of evolutionary theory that old-fashioned systematists took it\r\nin hand. Both Darwin and Hooker had wide and detailed knowledge of\r\nspecies as the starting-point of their induction.\r\n\r\nBefore we trace the part which Hooker himself played in the drama\r\nof evolutionary theory, it will be well to glance at his personal\r\nrelations with Darwin himself. It has been seen how he read the\r\nproof-sheets of the _Voyage of the 'Beagle'_ while still in his last\r\nyear of medical study. But before he started for the Antarctic he\r\nwas introduced to its author. It was in Trafalgar Square, and the\r\ninterview was brief but cordial. On returning from the Antarctic,\r\ncorrespondence was opened in 1843. In January 1844 Hooker received the\r\nmemorable letter confiding to him the germ of the Theory of Descent.\r\nDarwin wrote thus: \"At last gleams of light have come, and I am almost\r\nconvinced that species are not (it is like confessing a murder)\r\nimmutable:--I think I have found (here's presumption!) the simple way\r\nby which species become exquisitely adapted to various ends.\" This was\r\nprobably the first communication by Darwin of his species-theory to any\r\nscientific colleague.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence thus happily initiated between Darwin and Hooker is\r\npreserved in the _Life and Letters of Charles Darwin_, and in the two\r\nvolumes of _Letters_ subsequently published. They show on the one hand\r\nthe rapid growth of a deep friendship between these two potent minds,\r\nwhich ended only beside the grave of Darwin in Westminster Abbey. But\r\nwhat is more important is that these letters reveal, in a way that\r\nnone of the published work of either could have done, the steps in the\r\ngrowth of the great generalisation. We read of the doubts of one or\r\nthe other; the gradual accumulation of material facts; the criticisms\r\nand amendments in face of new evidence; and the slow progress from\r\ntentative hypothesis to assured belief. We ourselves have grown up\r\nsince the clash of opinion for and against the mutability of species\r\ndied down. It is hard for us to understand the strength of the feelings\r\naroused: the bitterness of the attack by the opponents of the theory,\r\nand the fortitude demanded from its adherents. It is best to obtain\r\nevidence on such matters at first hand; and this is what is supplied by\r\nthe correspondence between Darwin and Hooker.\r\n\r\nHow complete the understanding between the friends soon became is shown\r\nby the provisions made by Darwin for the publication of his manuscripts\r\nin case of sudden death. He wrote in August 1854 the definite direction\r\n\"Hooker by far the best man to edit my species volume\": and this\r\nnotwithstanding that he writes to him as a \"stern and awful judge and\r\nsceptic.\" But again, in a letter a few months later, he says to him: \"I\r\nforgot at the moment that you are the one living soul from whom I have\r\nconstantly received sympathy.\" I have already said that Hooker was not\r\nonly Darwin's first confidant but also the first to accept his theory\r\nof mutability of species. But even he did not fully assent to it till\r\nafter its first publication. The latter point comes out clearly from\r\nthe letters. In January 1859, six months after the reading of their\r\njoint communications to the Linnean Society, Darwin writes to Wallace:\r\n\"You ask about Lyell's frame of mind. I think he is somewhat staggered,\r\nbut does not give in ... I think he will end by being perverted. Dr\r\nHooker has become almost as heterodox as you or I, and I look at Hooker\r\nas by far the most capable judge in Europe.\" In September 1859 Darwin\r\nwrites to W. D. Fox: \"Lyell has read about half of the volume in clean\r\nsheets ... He is wavering so much about the immutability of species\r\nthat I expect he will come round. Hooker has come round, and will\r\npublish his belief soon.\" In the following month, writing to Hooker,\r\nDarwin says: \"I have spoken of you here as a convert made by me: but I\r\nknow well how much larger the share has been of your own self-thought.\"\r\nA letter to Wallace of November 1859 bears this postscript: \"I think\r\nthat I told you before that Hooker is a complete convert. If I can\r\nconvert Huxley I shall be content.\" And lastly, in a letter to W. B.\r\nCarpenter, of the same month, Darwin says: \"As yet I know only one\r\nbeliever, but I look at him as of the greatest authority, viz. Hooker.\"\r\nThese quotations clearly show that, while Lyell wavered, and Huxley had\r\nnot yet come in, Hooker was a complete adherent in 1859 to the doctrine\r\nof the mutability of species. Excepting Wallace, he was the first, in\r\nfact, of the great group that stood round Darwin, as he was the last of\r\nthem to survive.\r\n\r\nThe story of the joint communication of Darwin and of Wallace to the\r\nLinnean Society \"On the tendency of Species to form Varieties, and\r\non the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of\r\nSelection\" will be fresh in the minds of readers, for the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the event was lately celebrated in London. It was Sir\r\nCharles Lyell and Sir Joseph Hooker who jointly communicated the two\r\npapers to the society, together with the evidence of the priority of\r\nDarwin in the enquiry. Nothing could then have been more apposite\r\nthan the personal history which Sir Joseph gave at the Darwin-Wallace\r\ncelebration, held by the Linnean Society in 1908. He then told, at\r\nfirst hand, the exact circumstances under which the joint papers were\r\nproduced. Nor could the expressions used by the President (Dr Scott)\r\nwhen thanking Sir Joseph, and presenting to him the Darwin-Wallace\r\nMedal, have been improved. He said: \"The incalculable benefit that your\r\nconstant friendship, advice, and alliance were to Mr Darwin himself,\r\nis summed up in his own words, used in 1864: 'You have represented for\r\nmany years the whole great public to me.'\" The President then added:\r\n\"Of all men living it is to you more than to any other that the great\r\ngeneralisation of Darwin and Wallace owes its triumph.\"\r\n\r\nThe very last appearance of Hooker at any large public gathering of\r\nbiologists was at the centenary of Darwin's birth, celebrated at\r\nCambridge, in 1909. None who were there will forget the tall figure of\r\nthe veteran, aged, but still vigorous, with vivacity in every feature.\r\nHow gladly he accepted the congratulations of his many friends, and\r\nhow heartily he rejoiced over the full acceptance of the theory he had\r\nhimself done so much to promote. The end came only two years later,\r\nin December last. Many will have wished that the great group of the\r\nprotagonists of Evolution, Darwin, Lyell, and Hooker, should have found\r\ntheir final resting-place together in Westminster Abbey. But this was\r\nnot to be. Personal and family ties held him closer to Kew. And he lies\r\nthere in classic ground beside his father.\r\n\r\nHaving thus sketched the intimate relations which subsisted\r\nbetween Hooker and Darwin, it remains to appraise his own positive\r\ncontributions to _Philosophical Biology_. He himself, in his Address\r\nas President of the British Association at Norwich in 1868, gives\r\nan insight into his early attitude in the enquiry into biological\r\nquestions. \"Having myself,\" he says, \"been a student of Moral\r\nPhilosophy in a Northern University, I entered on my scientific career\r\nfull of hopes that Metaphysics would prove a useful mentor, if not a\r\nguide in science. I soon found, however, that it availed me nothing,\r\nand I long ago arrived at the conclusion so well put by Agassiz,\r\nwhen he says, 'We trust that the time is not distant when it will be\r\nuniversally understood that the battle of the evidences will have\r\nto be fought on the field of Physical Science, and not on that of\r\nthe Metaphysical.'\" This was the difficult lesson of the period when\r\nEvolution was born. Hooker learned the lesson early. He cleared his\r\nmental outlook from all preconceptions, and worked down to the bed-rock\r\nof objective fact. Thus he was free to use his vast and detailed\r\nknowledge in advancing, along the lines of induction alone, towards\r\nsound generalisations. These had their very close relation to questions\r\nof the mutability of species. The subject was approached by him through\r\nthe study of geographical distribution, in which, as we have seen, he\r\nhad at an early age become the leading authority.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Sir Joseph Hooker as a Philosophical Biologist rests upon\r\na masterly series of Essays and Addresses. The chief of these were\r\nThe Introductory Essay to the _Flora Tasmaniae_, dealing with the\r\nAntarctic Flora as a whole; The Essay on the Distribution of Arctic\r\nPlants, published in 1862; The Discourse on Insular Floras in 1866;\r\nThe Presidential Address to the British Association at Norwich in\r\n1868; his Address at York, in 1881, on Geographical Distribution; and\r\nfinally, The Essay on the Vegetation of India, published in 1904. None\r\nof these were mere inspirations of the moment. They were the outcome of\r\narduous journeys to observe and to collect, and subsequently of careful\r\nanalysis of the specimens and of the facts. The dates of publication\r\nbear this out. The Essay on the Antarctic Flora appeared about twenty\r\nyears after the completion of the voyage. The Essay on the Vegetation\r\nof India was not published till more than half a century after Hooker\r\nfirst set foot in India. It is upon such foundations that Hooker's\r\nreputation as a great constructive thinker is securely based.\r\n\r\nThe first-named of these essays will probably be estimated as the most\r\nnotable of them all in the History of Science. It was completed in\r\nNovember 1859, barely a year after the joint communications of Darwin\r\nand Wallace to the Linnean Society, and before the _Origin of Species_\r\nhad appeared. It was to this Essay that Darwin referred when he wrote\r\nthat \"Hooker has come round, and will publish his belief soon.\" But\r\nthis publication of his belief was not merely an echo of assent to\r\nDarwin's own opinions. It was a reasoned statement, advanced upon\r\nthe basis of his \"own self-thought,\" and his own wide systematic and\r\ngeographical experience. From these sources he drew for himself support\r\nfor the \"hypothesis that species are derivative, and mutable.\" He\r\npoints out how the natural history of Australia seemed specially suited\r\nto test such a theory, on account of the comparative uniformity of the\r\nphysical features being accompanied by a great variety in its Flora,\r\nand the peculiarity of both its Fauna and Flora, as compared with other\r\ncountries. After the test had been made, on the basis of study of some\r\n8000 species, their characters, their spread, and their relations to\r\nthose of other lands, he concludes decisively in favour of mutability\r\nand a doctrine of progression.\r\n\r\nHow highly this Essay was esteemed by his contemporaries is shown by\r\nthe expressions of Lyell and of Darwin. The former writes: \"I have just\r\nfinished the reading of your splendid Essay on the Origin of Species,\r\nas illustrated by your wide botanical experience, and think it goes\r\nfar to raise the variety-making hypothesis to the rank of a theory, as\r\naccounting for the manner in which new species enter the world.\" Darwin\r\nwrote: \"I have finished your Essay. To my judgment it is by far the\r\ngrandest and most interesting essay on subjects of the nature discussed\r\nI have ever read.\"\r\n\r\nBut besides its historical interest in relation to the Species\r\nQuestion, the Essay contained what was up to its time the most\r\nscientific treatment of a large area from the point of view of the\r\nPlant-Geographer. He found that the Antarctic, like the Arctic Flora,\r\nis very uniform round the Globe. The same species in many cases occur\r\non every island, though thousands of miles of ocean may intervene.\r\nMany of these species reappear on the mountains of Southern Chili,\r\nAustralia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. The Southern Temperate Floras,\r\non the other hand, of South America, South Africa, Australia, and New\r\nZealand differ more among themselves than do the Floras of Europe,\r\nNorthern Asia, and North America. To explain these facts he suggested\r\nthe probable former existence, during a warmer period than the present,\r\nof a centre of creation of new species in the Southern Ocean, in the\r\nform of either a continent or an archipelago, from which the Antarctic\r\nFlora radiated. This hypothesis has since been held open to doubt.\r\nBut the fact that it was suggested shows the broad view which he was\r\nprepared to take of the problem before him. His method was essentially\r\nthat which is now styled \"Ecological.\" Many hold this to be a new\r\nphase of botanical enquiry, introduced by Professor Warming in 1895.\r\nNo one will deny the value of the increased precision which he then\r\nbrought into such studies. But in point of fact it was Ecology on the\r\ngrand scale that Sir Joseph Hooker practised in the Antarctic in 1840.\r\nMoreover it was pursued, not in regions of old civilisation, but in\r\nlands where Nature held her sway untouched by the hand of man.\r\n\r\nThis Essay on the Flora of the Antarctic was the prototype of the\r\ngreat series. Sir Joseph examined the Arctic Flora from similar points\r\nof view. He explained the circumpolar uniformity which it shows, and\r\nthe prevalence of Scandinavian types, together with the peculiarly\r\nlimited nature of the Flora of the southward peninsula of Greenland.\r\nHe extended his enquiries to oceanic islands. He pointed out that\r\nthe conditions which dictated circumpolar distribution are absent\r\nfrom them; but that other conditions exist in them which account for\r\nthe strange features which their vegetation shows. He extended the\r\napplication of such methods to the Himalaya and to Central Asia. He\r\njoined with Asa Gray in like enquiries in North America. The latter had\r\nalready given a scientific explanation of the surprising fact that the\r\nplants of the Eastern States resemble more nearly those of China than\r\ndo those of the Pacific Slope. In resolving these and other problems\r\nit was not only the vegetation itself that was studied. The changes of\r\nclimate in geological time, and of the earth's crust as demonstrated\r\nby geologists, formed part of the basis on which he worked. For it is\r\nfacts such as these which have determined the migration of Floras. And\r\nmigration, as well as mutability of species, entered into most of his\r\nspeculations. The Essays of this magnificent series are like pictures\r\npainted with a full brush. The boldness and mastery which they show\r\nsprang from long discipline and wide experience.\r\n\r\nFinally, the chief results of the Phyto-Geographical work of himself\r\nand of others were summed up in the great Address on \"Geographical\r\nDistribution\" at York. The Jubilee of the British Association was held\r\nthere in 1881. It had been decided that each section should be presided\r\nover by a past President of the Association, and he had occupied that\r\nposition at Norwich in 1868. Accordingly at York Hooker was appointed\r\nPresident of the Geographical Section, and he chose as the subject\r\nof his Address \"The Geographical Distribution of Organic Beings.\"\r\nTo him it illustrated \"the interdependence of those Sciences which\r\nthe Geographer should study.\" It is not enough merely to observe the\r\ntopography of organisms, but their hypsometrical distribution must\r\nalso be noted. Further, the changes of area and of altitude in exposed\r\nland-surfaces of which geology gives evidence, are essential features\r\nin the problem, together with the changes of climate, such as have\r\ndetermined the advance and retrocession of glacial conditions. Having\r\nnoted these factors, he continued thus: \"With the establishment of the\r\ndoctrine of orderly evolution of species under known laws I close this\r\nlist of those recognised principles of the science of geographical\r\ndistribution, which must guide all who enter upon its pursuit. As\r\nHumboldt was its founder, and Forbes its reformer, so we must regard\r\nDarwin as its latest and greatest law-giver.\" Now, after thirty years,\r\nmay we not add to these words of his, that Hooker was himself its\r\ngreatest exponent?\r\n\r\nAnd so we have followed, however inadequately, this great man into\r\nthe various lines of scientific activity which he pursued. We\r\nhave seen him to excel in them all. The cumulative result is that\r\nhe is universally held to have been, during several decades, the\r\nmost distinguished botanist of his time. He was before all things a\r\nphilosopher. In him we see the foremost student of the broader aspects\r\nof Plant-Life at the time when evolutionary belief was nascent. His\r\ninfluence at that stirring period, though quiet, was far-reaching and\r\ndeep. His work was both critical and constructive. His wide knowledge,\r\nhis keen insight, his fearless judgment were invaluable in advancing\r\nthat intellectual revolution which found its pivot in the mutability of\r\nspecies. The share he took in promoting it was second only to that of\r\nhis life-long friend Charles Darwin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Absorption, Aristotelian views on, 68\r\n\r\n  ---- Grew and, 58\r\n\r\n  ---- Hales and, 73-76\r\n\r\n  ---- Mariotte and, 68\r\n\r\n  Adanson, Plant families and, 41\r\n\r\n  Agassiz, appreciation of, 215, 319\r\n\r\n  Agriculture, investigations in, 234, 236-237\r\n\r\n  ---- physiology and, 7\r\n\r\n  ---- Theophrastus and, 9\r\n\r\n  Algae, Berkeley on British, 226\r\n\r\n  ---- collection of, 214, 216\r\n\r\n  ---- Harvey on, 208, 210-212, 216\r\n\r\n  ---- systematic work on, 202\r\n\r\n  ---- Williamson and, 252\r\n\r\n  Algal floras, 219\r\n\r\n  Alston, Charles, King's Botanist, =283-284=\r\n\r\n  ---- Hales and, 285-286\r\n\r\n  ---- investigations of, 285\r\n\r\n  ---- publications of, 286\r\n\r\n  Alternation of generations, 188-189, 198\r\n\r\n  Amman, Morison's method and, 26\r\n\r\n  _Anabena_ filaments, Griffith on, 190, 196\r\n\r\n  Anatomical method, W.
