SEWARD,\r\nFELLOW OF EMMANUEL COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE\r\n\r\nIN TWO VOLUMES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nAll biographical footnotes appear at the end of Volume II.\r\n\r\nAll other notes by Charles Darwin's editors appear in the text, in\r\nbrackets () with a Chapter/Note or Letter/Note number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATED WITH AFFECTION AND RESPECT, TO\r\n\r\nSIR JOSEPH HOOKER\r\n\r\nIN REMEMBRANCE OF HIS LIFELONG FRIENDSHIP WITH CHARLES DARWIN\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You will never know how much I owe to you for your constant kindness\r\nand encouragement\"\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO SIR JOSEPH HOOKER, SEPTEMBER 14, 1862\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nThe \"Life and Letters of Charles Darwin\" was published in 1887. Since\r\nthat date, through the kindness of various correspondents, additional\r\nletters have been received; among them may be mentioned those written by\r\nMr. Darwin to Mr. Belt, Lady Derby, Hugh Falconer, Mr. Francis Galton,\r\nHuxley, Lyell, Mr. John Morley, Max Muller, Owen, Lord Playfair, John\r\nScott, Thwaites, Sir William Turner, John Jenner Weir. But the material\r\nfor our work consisted in chief part of a mass of letters which, for\r\nwant of space or for other reasons, were not printed in the \"Life and\r\nLetters.\" We would draw particular attention to the correspondence with\r\nSir Joseph Hooker. To him Mr. Darwin wrote with complete freedom, and\r\nthis has given something of a personal charm to the most technical\r\nof his letters. There is also much correspondence, hardly inferior in\r\nbiographical interest, with Sir Charles Lyell, Fritz Muller, Mr. Huxley,\r\nand Mr. Wallace. From this unused material we have been able to compile\r\nan almost complete record of Mr. Darwin's work in a series of letters\r\nnow published for the first time. We have, however, in a few instances,\r\nrepeated paragraphs, or in one or two cases whole letters, from the\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" where such repetition seemed necessary for the sake\r\nof clearness or continuity.\r\n\r\nOur two volumes contain practically all the matter that it now\r\nseems desirable to publish. But at some future time others may find\r\ninteresting data in what remains unprinted; this is certainly true of a\r\nshort series of letters dealing with the Cirripedes, which are omitted\r\nsolely for want of space. (Preface/1. Those addressed to the late Albany\r\nHancock have already appeared in the \"Transactions of the Tyneside Nat.\r\nField Club,\" VIII., page 250.)\r\n\r\nWe are fortunate in being permitted, by Sir Joseph Hooker and by Mr.\r\nWallace, to publish certain letters from them to Mr. Darwin. We have\r\nalso been able to give a few letters from Sir Charles Lyell, Hugh\r\nFalconer, Edward Forbes, Dr. Asa Gray, Professor Hyatt, Fritz Muller,\r\nMr. Francis Galton, and Sir T. Lauder Brunton. To the two last named,\r\nalso to Mrs. Lyell (the biographer of Sir Charles), Mrs. Asa Gray and\r\nMrs. Hyatt, we desire to express our grateful acknowledgments.\r\n\r\nThe present volumes have been prepared, so as to give as full an idea\r\nas possible of the course of Mr. Darwin's work. The volumes therefore\r\nnecessarily contain many letters of a highly technical character, but\r\nnone, we hope, which are not essentially interesting. With a view to\r\nsaving space, we have confined ourselves to elucidating the letters\r\nby full annotations, and have for the same reason--though with some\r\nregret--omitted in most cases the beginnings and endings of the letters.\r\nFor the main facts of Mr. Darwin's life, we refer our readers to the\r\nabstract of his private Diary, given in the present volume.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin generally wrote his letters when he was tired or hurried, and\r\nthis often led to the omission of words. We have usually inserted\r\nthe articles, and this without any indication of their absence in the\r\noriginals. Where there seemed any possibility of producing an alteration\r\nof meaning (and in many cases where there is no such possibility) we\r\nhave placed the introduced words in square brackets. We may say once for\r\nall that throughout the book square brackets indicate words not found\r\nin the originals. (Preface/2. Except in a few places where brackets are\r\nused to indicate passages previously published. In all such cases the\r\nmeaning of the symbol is explained.) Dots indicate omissions, but many\r\nomissions are made without being so indicated.\r\n\r\nThe selection and arrangement of the letters have not been easy. Our\r\nplan has been to classify the letters according to subject--into such\r\nas deal with Evolution, Geographical Distribution, Botany, etc., and in\r\neach group to place the letters chronologically. But in several of the\r\nchapters we have adopted sectional headings, which we believe will be a\r\nhelp to the reader. The great difficulty lay in deciding in which of the\r\nchief groups a given letter should be placed. If the MS. had been cut up\r\ninto paragraphs, there would have been no such difficulty; but we feel\r\nstrongly that a letter should as far as possible be treated as a whole.\r\nWe have in fact allowed this principle to interfere with an accurate\r\nclassification, so that the reader will find, for instance, in the\r\nchapters on Evolution, questions considered which might equally well\r\nhave come under Geographical Distribution or Geology, or questions\r\nin the chapter on Man which might have been placed under the heading\r\nEvolution. In the same way, to avoid mutilation, we have allowed\r\nreferences to one branch of science to remain in letters mainly\r\nconcerned with another subject. For these irregularities we must ask\r\nthe reader's patience, and beg him to believe that some pains have been\r\ndevoted to arrangement.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, who was careful in other things, generally omitted the date\r\nin familiar correspondence, and it is often only by treating a letter\r\nas a detective studies a crime that we can make sure of its date.\r\nFortunately, however, Sir Joseph Hooker and others of Darwin's\r\ncorrespondents were accustomed to add the date on which the letters were\r\nreceived. This sometimes leads to an inaccuracy which needs a word of\r\nexplanation. Thus a letter which Mr. Darwin dated \"Wednesday\" might be\r\nheaded by us \"Wednesday [January 3rd, 1867],\" the latter half being\r\nthe date on which the letter was received; if it had been dated by the\r\nwriter it would have been \"Wednesday, January 2nd, 1867.\"\r\n\r\nIn thanking those friends--especially Sir Joseph Hooker and Mr.\r\nWallace--who have looked through some of our proof-sheets, we wish to\r\nmake it clear that they are not in the smallest degree responsible for\r\nour errors or omissions; the weight of our shortcomings rests on us\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nWe desire to express our gratitude to those who have so readily supplied\r\nus with information, especially to Sir Joseph Hooker, Professor Judd,\r\nProfessor Newton, Dr. Sharp, Mr. Herbert Spencer, and Mr. Wallace. And\r\nwe have pleasure in mentioning Mr. H.W. Rutherford, of the University\r\nLibrary, to whose conscientious work as a copyist we are much indebted.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is a pleasure to express our obligation to those who have\r\nhelped us in the matter of illustrations. The portraits of Dr. Asa Gray,\r\nMr. Huxley, Sir Charles Lyell, Mr. Romanes, are from their respective\r\nBiographies, and for permission to make use of them we have to thank\r\nMrs. Gray, Mr. L. Huxley, Mrs. Lyell, and Mrs. Romanes, as well as the\r\npublishers of the books in question. For the reproduction of the\r\nearly portrait of Mr. Darwin we are indebted to Miss Wedgwood; for the\r\ninteresting portraits of Hugh Falconer and Edward Forbes we have to\r\nthank Mr. Irvine Smith, who obtained for us the negatives; these being\r\nof paper, and nearly sixty years old, rendered their reproduction a work\r\nof some difficulty. We also thank Messrs. Elliott & Fry for very kindly\r\nplacing at our disposal a negative of the fine portrait, which forms the\r\nfrontispiece to Volume II. For the opportunity of making facsimiles of\r\ndiagrams in certain of the letters, we are once more indebted to Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker, who has most generously given the original letters to Mr.\r\nDarwin's family.\r\n\r\nCambridge, October, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME I.\r\n\r\nOutline of Charles Darwin's Life, etc.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.I.--An Autobiographical Fragment, and Early Letters,\r\n1809-1842.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.II.--Evolution, 1844-1858.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.III.--Evolution, 1859-1863.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.IV.--Evolution, 1864-1869.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.V.--Evolution, 1870-1882.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VI.--Geographical Distribution, 1843-1867.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS IN VOLUME I.\r\n\r\nCHARLES AND CATHERINE DARWIN, 1816.

In the process of removing the remainder of Mr. Darwin's\r\nbooks and papers from Down, the following autobiographical notes,\r\nwritten in 1838, came to light. They seem to us worth publishing--both\r\nas giving some new facts, and also as illustrating the interest which\r\nhe clearly felt in his own development. Many words are omitted in the\r\nmanuscript, and some names incorrectly spelled; the corrections which\r\nhave been made are not always indicated.)\r\n\r\nMy earliest recollection, the date of which I can approximately tell,\r\nand which must have been before I was four years old, was when sitting\r\non Caroline's (Caroline Darwin) knee in the drawing room, whilst she was\r\ncutting an orange for me, a cow ran by the window which made me jump, so\r\nthat I received a bad cut, of which I bear the scar to this day. Of this\r\nscene I recollect the place where I sat and the cause of the fright,\r\nbut not the cut itself, and I think my memory is real, and not as\r\noften happens in similar cases, [derived] from hearing the thing often\r\nrepeated, [when] one obtains so vivid an image, that it cannot be\r\nseparated from memory: because I clearly remember which way the cow ran,\r\nwhich would not probably have been told me. My memory here is an obscure\r\npicture, in which from not recollecting any pain I am scarcely conscious\r\nof its reference to myself.\r\n\r\n1813.\r\n\r\nWhen I was four years and a half old I went to the sea, and stayed\r\nthere some weeks. I remember many things, but with the exception of the\r\nmaidservants (and these are not individualised) I recollect none of\r\nmy family who were there. I remember either myself or Catherine being\r\nnaughty, and being shut up in a room and trying to break the windows. I\r\nhave an obscure picture of a house before my eyes, and of a neighbouring\r\nsmall shop, where the owner gave me one fig, but which to my great joy\r\nturned out to be two: this fig was given me that the man might kiss the\r\nmaidservant. I remember a common walk to a kind of well, on the road\r\nto which was a cottage shaded with damascene (Chapter I./2. Damson\r\nis derived from Damascene; the fruit was formerly known as a \"Damask\r\nPrune.\") trees, inhabited by an old man, called a hermit, with white\r\nhair, who used to give us damascenes. I know not whether the damascenes,\r\nor the reverence and indistinct fear for this old man produced the\r\ngreatest effect on my memory. I remember when going there crossing in\r\nthe carriage a broad ford, and fear and astonishment of white foaming\r\nwater has made a vivid impression. I think memory of events commences\r\nabruptly; that is, I remember these earliest things quite as clearly as\r\nothers very much later in life, which were equally impressed on me. Some\r\nvery early recollections are connected with fear at Parkfield and with\r\npoor Betty Harvey. I remember with horror her story of people being\r\npushed into the canal by the towing rope, by going the wrong side of the\r\nhorse. I had the greatest horror of this story--keen instinct against\r\ndeath. Some other recollections are those of vanity--namely, thinking\r\nthat people were admiring me, in one instance for perseverance and\r\nanother for boldness in climbing a low tree, and what is odder, a\r\nconsciousness, as if instinctive, that I was vain, and contempt of\r\nmyself. My supposed admirer was old Peter Haile the bricklayer, and\r\nthe tree the mountain ash on the lawn. All my recollections seem to be\r\nconnected most closely with myself; now Catherine (Catherine Darwin)\r\nseems to recollect scenes where others were the chief actors. When my\r\nmother died I was 8 1/2 years old, and [Catherine] one year less, yet\r\nshe remembers all particulars and events of each day whilst I scarcely\r\nrecollect anything (and so with very many other cases) except being sent\r\nfor, the memory of going into her room, my father meeting me--crying\r\nafterwards. I recollect my mother's gown and scarcely anything of\r\nher appearance, except one or two walks with her. I have no distinct\r\nremembrance of any conversation, and those only of a very trivial\r\nnature. I remember her saying \"if she did ask me to do something,\" which\r\nI said she had, \"it was solely for my good.\"\r\n\r\nCatherine remembers my mother crying, when she heard of my grandmother's\r\ndeath. Also when at Parkfield how Aunt Sarah and Aunt Kitty used to\r\nreceive her. Susan, like me, only remembers affairs personal. It is\r\nsufficiently odd this [difference] in subjects remembered. Catherine\r\nsays she does not remember the impression made upon her by external\r\nthings, as scenery, but for things which she reads she has an excellent\r\nmemory, i.e., for ideas. Now her sympathy being ideal, it is part of her\r\ncharacter, and shows how easily her kind of memory was stamped, a vivid\r\nthought is repeated, a vivid impression forgotten.\r\n\r\nI remember obscurely the illumination after the battle of Waterloo,\r\nand the Militia exercising about that period, in the field opposite our\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n1817.\r\n\r\nAt 8 1/2 years old I went to Mr. Case's School. (Chapter I/3. A\r\nday-school at Shrewsbury kept by Rev. G. Case, minister of the Unitarian\r\nChapel (\"Life and Letters,\" Volume I., page 27 et seq.)) I remember how\r\nvery much I was afraid of meeting the dogs in Barker Street, and how\r\nat school I could not get up my courage to fight. I was very timid by\r\nnature. I remember I took great delight at school in fishing for\r\nnewts in the quarry pool. I had thus young formed a strong taste\r\nfor collecting, chiefly seals, franks, etc., but also pebbles and\r\nminerals--one which was given me by some boy decided this taste. I\r\nbelieve shortly after this, or before, I had smattered in botany, and\r\ncertainly when at Mr. Case's School I was very fond of gardening, and\r\ninvented some great falsehoods about being able to colour crocuses as I\r\nliked. (Chapter I./4. The story is given in the \"Life and Letters,\" I.,\r\npage 28, the details being slightly different.) At this time I felt very\r\nstrong friendship for some boys. It was soon after I began collecting\r\nstones, i.e., when 9 or 10, that I distinctly recollect the desire I had\r\nof being able to know something about every pebble in front of the hall\r\ndoor--it was my earliest and only geological aspiration at that time.\r\nI was in those days a very great story-teller--for the pure pleasure of\r\nexciting attention and surprise. I stole fruit and hid it for these same\r\nmotives, and injured trees by barking them for similar ends. I scarcely\r\never went out walking without saying I had seen a pheasant or some\r\nstrange bird (natural history taste); these lies, when not detected,\r\nI presume, excited my attention, as I recollect them vividly, not\r\nconnected with shame, though some I do, but as something which by having\r\nproduced a great effect on my mind, gave pleasure like a tragedy. I\r\nrecollect when I was at Mr. Case's inventing a whole fabric to show how\r\nfond I was of speaking the TRUTH! My invention is still so vivid in my\r\nmind, that I could almost fancy it was true, did not memory of former\r\nshame tell me it was false. I have no particularly happy or unhappy\r\nrecollections of this time or earlier periods of my life. I remember\r\nwell a walk I took with a boy named Ford across some fields to a\r\nfarmhouse on the Church Stretton road. I do not remember any mental\r\npursuits excepting those of collecting stones, etc., gardening, and\r\nabout this time often going with my father in his carriage, telling him\r\nof my lessons, and seeing game and other wild birds, which was a great\r\ndelight to me. I was born a naturalist.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 9 1/2 years old (July 1818) I went with Erasmus to see\r\nLiverpool: it has left no impressions on my mind, except most trifling\r\nones--fear of the coach upsetting, a good dinner, and an extremely vague\r\nmemory of ships.\r\n\r\nIn Midsummer of this year I went to Dr. Butler's School. (Chapter I./5.\r\nDarwin entered Dr. Butler's school in Shrewsbury in the summer of 1818,\r\nand remained there till 1825 (\"Life and Letters,\" I., page 30).) I well\r\nrecollect the first going there, which oddly enough I cannot of going to\r\nMr. Case's, the first school of all. I remember the year 1818 well,\r\nnot from having first gone to a public school, but from writing those\r\nfigures in my school book, accompanied with obscure thoughts, now\r\nfulfilled, whether I should recollect in future life that year.\r\n\r\nIn September (1818) I was ill with the scarlet fever. I well remember\r\nthe wretched feeling of being delirious.\r\n\r\n1819, July (10 1/2 years old).\r\n\r\nWent to the sea at Plas Edwards and stayed there three weeks, which now\r\nappears to me like three months. (Chapter I./6. Plas Edwards, at Towyn,\r\non the Welsh coast.) I remember a certain shady green road (where I\r\nsaw a snake) and a waterfall, with a degree of pleasure, which must be\r\nconnected with the pleasure from scenery, though not directly recognised\r\nas such. The sandy plain before the house has left a strong impression,\r\nwhich is obscurely connected with an indistinct remembrance of\r\ncurious insects, probably a Cimex mottled with red, and Zygaena, the\r\nburnet-moth. I was at that time very passionate (when I swore like a\r\ntrooper) and quarrelsome. The former passion has I think nearly wholly\r\nbut slowly died away. When journeying there by stage coach I remember a\r\nrecruiting officer (I think I should know his face to this day) at\r\ntea time, asking the maid-servant for toasted bread and butter. I was\r\nconvulsed with laughter and thought it the quaintest and wittiest speech\r\nthat ever passed from the mouth of man. Such is wit at 10 1/2 years old.\r\nThe memory now flashes across me of the pleasure I had in the evening on\r\na blowy day walking along the beach by myself and seeing the gulls and\r\ncormorants wending their way home in a wild and irregular course. Such\r\npoetic pleasures, felt so keenly in after years, I should not have\r\nexpected so early in life.\r\n\r\n1820, July.\r\n\r\nWent a riding tour (on old Dobbin) with Erasmus to Pistyll Rhiadr\r\n(Chapter I./7. Pistyll Rhiadr proceeds from Llyn Pen Rhiadr down the\r\nLlyfnant to the Dovey.); of this I recollect little, an indistinct\r\npicture of the fall, but I well remember my astonishment on hearing that\r\nfishes could jump up it.\r\n\r\n(Chapter I./8. The autobiographical fragment here comes to an end. The\r\nnext letters give some account of Darwin as an Edinburgh student. He\r\nhas described (\"Life and Letters,\" I., pages 35-45) his failure to be\r\ninterested in the official teaching of the University, his horror at\r\nthe operating theatre, and his gradually increasing dislike of medical\r\nstudy, which finally determined his leaving Edinburgh, and entering\r\nCambridge with a view to taking Orders.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 1. TO R.W. DARWIN. Sunday Morning [Edinburgh, October, 1825].\r\n\r\nMy dear Father\r\n\r\nAs I suppose Erasmus (Erasmus Darwin) has given all the particulars of\r\nthe journey, I will say no more about it, except that altogether it has\r\ncost me 7 pounds. We got into our lodgings yesterday evening, which\r\nare very comfortable and near the College. Our Landlady, by name Mrs.\r\nMackay, is a nice clean old body--exceedingly civil and attentive. She\r\nlives in \"11, Lothian Street, Edinburgh\" (1/1. In a letter printed in\r\nthe \"Edinburgh Evening Despatch\" of May 22nd, 1888, the writer suggested\r\nthat a tablet should be placed on the house, 11, Lothian Street. This\r\nsuggestion was carried out in 1888 by Mr. Ralph Richardson (Clerk of\r\nthe Commissary Court, Edinburgh), who obtained permission from the\r\nproprietors to affix a tablet to the house, setting forth that Charles\r\nDarwin resided there as an Edinburgh University student. We are indebted\r\nto Mr. W.K. Dickson for obtaining for us this information, and to Mr.\r\nRalph Richardson for kindly supplying us with particulars. See Mr.\r\nRichardson's Inaugural Address, \"Trans. Edinb. Geol. Soc.\" 1894-95; also\r\n\"Memorable Edinburgh Houses,\" by Wilmot Harrison, 1898.), and only four\r\nflights of steps from the ground-floor, which is very moderate to some\r\nother lodgings that we were nearly taking. The terms are 1 pound 6\r\nshillings for two very nice and LIGHT bedrooms and a sitting-room; by\r\nthe way, light bedrooms are very scarce articles in Edinburgh, since\r\nmost of them are little holes in which there is neither air nor light.\r\nWe called on Dr. Hanley the first morning, whom I think we never should\r\nhave found, had it not been for a good-natured Dr. of Divinity who took\r\nus into his library and showed us a map, and gave us directions how to\r\nfind him. Indeed, all the Scotchmen are so civil and attentive, that it\r\nis enough to make an Englishman ashamed of himself. I should think Dr.\r\nButler or any other fat English Divine would take two utter strangers\r\ninto his library and show them the way! When at last we found the\r\nDoctor, and having made all the proper speeches on both sides, we\r\nall three set out and walked all about the town, which we admire\r\nexcessively; indeed Bridge Street is the most extraordinary thing I ever\r\nsaw, and when we first looked over the sides, we could hardly believe\r\nour eyes, when instead of a fine river, we saw a stream of people. We\r\nspend all our mornings in promenading about the town, which we know\r\npretty well, and in the evenings we go to the play to hear Miss Stephens\r\n(Probably Catherine Stephens), which is quite delightful; she is very\r\npopular here, being encored to such a degree, that she can hardly get\r\non with the play. On Monday we are going to Der F (I do not know how\r\nto spell the rest of the word). (1/2. \"Der F\" is doubtless \"Der\r\nFreischutz,\" which appeared in 1820, and of which a selection was\r\ngiven in London, under Weber's direction, in 1825. The last of Weber's\r\ncompositions, \"From Chindara's warbling fount,\" was written for Miss\r\nStephens, who sang it to his accompaniment \"the last time his fingers\r\ntouched the key-board.\" (See \"Dict. of Music,\" \"Stephens\" and \"Weber.\"))\r\nBefore we got into our lodgings, we were staying at the Star Hotel in\r\nPrinces St., where to my surprise I met with an old schoolfellow, whom I\r\nlike very much; he is just come back from a walking tour in Switzerland\r\nand is now going to study for his [degree?] The introductory lectures\r\nbegin next Wednesday, and we were matriculated for them on Saturday; we\r\npay 10s., and write our names in a book, and the ceremony is finished;\r\nbut the Library is not free to us till we get a ticket from a Professor.\r\nWe just have been to Church and heard a sermon of only 20 minutes. I\r\nexpected, from Sir Walter Scott's account, a soul-cutting discourse of 2\r\nhours and a half.\r\n\r\nI remain your affectionate son, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 2. TO CAROLINE DARWIN. January 6th, 1826. Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your very entertaining letter, which was a great relief\r\nafter hearing a long stupid lecture from Duncan on Materia Medica, but\r\nas you know nothing either of the Lectures or Lecturers, I will give you\r\na short account of them. Dr. Duncan is so very learned that his wisdom\r\nhas left no room for his sense, and he lectures, as I have already\r\nsaid, on the Materia Medica, which cannot be translated into any word\r\nexpressive enough of its stupidity. These few last mornings, however, he\r\nhas shown signs of improvement, and I hope he will \"go on as well as\r\ncan be expected.\" His lectures begin at eight in the morning. Dr. Hope\r\nbegins at ten o'clock, and I like both him and his lectures VERY much\r\n(after which Erasmus goes to \"Mr. Sizars on Anatomy,\" who is a charming\r\nLecturer). At 12 the Hospital, after which I attend Monro on Anatomy. I\r\ndislike him and his lectures so much, that I cannot speak with decency\r\nabout them. Thrice a week we have what is called Clinical lectures,\r\nwhich means lectures on the sick people in the Hospital--these I like\r\nvery much. I said this account should be short, but I am afraid it has\r\nbeen too long, like the lectures themselves.\r\n\r\nI will be a good boy and tell something about Johnson again (not but\r\nwhat I am very much surprised that Papa should so forget himself as call\r\nme, a Collegian in the University of Edinburgh, a boy). He has changed\r\nhis lodgings for the third time; he has got very cheap ones, but I am\r\nafraid it will not answer, for they must make up by cheating. I hope\r\nyou like Erasmus' official news, he means to begin every letter so. You\r\nmentioned in your letter that Emma was staying with you: if she is\r\nnot gone, ask her to tell Jos that I have not succeeded in getting any\r\ntitanium, but that I will try again...I want to know how old I shall be\r\nnext birthday--I believe 17, and if so, I shall be forced to go abroad\r\nfor one year, since it is necessary that I shall have completed my 21st\r\nyear before I take my degree. Now you have no business to be frowning\r\nand puzzling over this letter, for I did not promise to write a good\r\nhand to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 3. TO J.S. HENSLOW.\r\n\r\n(3/1. Extracts from Darwin's letters to Henslow were read before the\r\nCambridge Philosophical Society on November 16th, 1835. Some of the\r\nletters were subsequently printed, in an 8vo pamphlet of 31 pages, dated\r\nDecember 1st, 1835, for private distribution among the members of the\r\nSociety. A German translation by W. Preyer appeared in the \"Deutsche\r\nRundschau,\" June 1891.)\r\n\r\n[15th August, 1832. Monte Video.]\r\n\r\nWe are now beating up the Rio Plata, and I take the opportunity of\r\nbeginning a letter to you. I did not send off the specimens from Rio\r\nJaneiro, as I grudged the time it would take to pack them up. They are\r\nnow ready to be sent off and most probably go by this packet. If so they\r\ngo to Falmouth (where Fitz-Roy has made arrangements) and so will not\r\ntrouble your brother's agent in London. When I left England I was not\r\nfully aware how essential a kindness you offered me when you undertook\r\nto receive my boxes. I do not know what I should do without such\r\nhead-quarters. And now for an apologetical prose about my collection: I\r\nam afraid you will say it is very small, but I have not been idle, and\r\nyou must recollect what a very small show hundreds of species make. The\r\nbox contains a good many geological specimens; I am well aware that the\r\ngreater number are too small. But I maintain that no person has a right\r\nto accuse me, till he has tried carrying rocks under a tropical sun.\r\nI have endeavoured to get specimens of every variety of rock, and have\r\nwritten notes upon all. If you think it worth your while to examine\r\nany of them I shall be very glad of some mineralogical information,\r\nespecially on any numbers between 1 and 254 which include Santiago\r\nrocks. By my catalogue I shall know which you may refer to. As for my\r\nplants, \"pudet pigetque mihi.\" All I can say is that when objects are\r\npresent which I can observe and particularise about, I cannot summon\r\nresolution to collect when I know nothing.\r\n\r\nIt is positively distressing to walk in the glorious forest amidst such\r\ntreasures and feel they are all thrown away upon one. My collection from\r\nthe Abrolhos is interesting, as I suspect it nearly contains the whole\r\nflowering vegetation--and indeed from extreme sterility the same may\r\nalmost be said of Santiago. I have sent home four bottles with animals\r\nin spirits, I have three more, but would not send them till I had a\r\nfourth. I shall be anxious to hear how they fare. I made an enormous\r\ncollection of Arachnidae at Rio, also a good many small beetles in pill\r\nboxes, but it is not the best time of year for the latter. Amongst the\r\nlower animals nothing has so much interested me as finding two species\r\nof elegantly coloured true Planaria inhabiting the dewy forest! The\r\nfalse relation they bear to snails is the most extraordinary thing of\r\nthe kind I have ever seen. In the same genus (or more truly family) some\r\nof the marine species possess an organisation so marvellous that I can\r\nscarcely credit my eyesight. Every one has heard of the discoloured\r\nstreaks of water in the equatorial regions. One I examined was owing\r\nto the presence of such minute Oscillariae that in each square inch\r\nof surface there must have been at least one hundred thousand present.\r\nAfter this I had better be silent, for you will think me a Baron\r\nMunchausen amongst naturalists. Most assuredly I might collect a far\r\ngreater number of specimens of Invertebrate animals if I took less time\r\nover each; but I have come to the conclusion that two animals with\r\ntheir original colour and shape noted down will be more valuable to\r\nnaturalists than six with only dates and place. I hope you will send me\r\nyour criticisms about my collection; and it will be my endeavour that\r\nnothing you say shall be lost on me. I would send home my writings with\r\nmy specimens, only I find I have so repeatedly occasion to refer back\r\nthat it would be a serious loss to me. I cannot conclude about my\r\ncollection without adding that I implicitly trust in your keeping an\r\nexact account against all the expense of boxes, etc., etc. At this\r\npresent minute we are at anchor in the mouth of the river, and such a\r\nstrange scene as it is. Everything is in flames--the sky with lightning,\r\nthe water with luminous particles, and even the very masts are pointed\r\nwith a blue flame. I expect great interest in scouring over the plains\r\nof Monte Video, yet I look back with regret to the Tropics, that magic\r\nlure to all naturalists. The delight of sitting on a decaying trunk\r\namidst the quiet gloom of the forest is unspeakable and never to be\r\nforgotten. How often have I then wished for you. When I see a banana I\r\nwell recollect admiring them with you in Cambridge--little did I then\r\nthink how soon I should eat their fruit.\r\n\r\nAugust 15th. In a few days the box will go by the \"Emulous\" packet\r\n(Capt. Cooke) to Falmouth and will be forwarded to you. This letter goes\r\nthe same way, so that if in course of due time you do not receive the\r\nbox, will you be kind enough to write to Falmouth? We have been here\r\n(Monte Video) for some time; but owing to bad weather and continual\r\nfighting on shore, we have scarcely ever been able to walk in the\r\ncountry. I have collected during the last month nothing, but to-day I\r\nhave been out and returned like Noah's Ark with animals of all sorts.\r\nI have to-day to my astonishment found two Planariae living under dry\r\nstones: ask L. Jenyns if he has ever heard of this fact. I also found a\r\nmost curious snail, and spiders, beetles, snakes, scorpions ad libitum,\r\nand to conclude shot a Cavia weighing a cwt.--On Friday we sail for the\r\nRio Negro, and then will commence our real wild work. I look forward\r\nwith dread to the wet stormy regions of the south, but after so much\r\npleasure I must put up with some sea-sickness and misery.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 4. TO J.S. HENSLOW. Monte Video, 24th November 1832.\r\n\r\nWe arrived here on the 24th of October, after our first cruise on the\r\ncoast of Patagonia. North of the Rio Negro we fell in with some little\r\nschooners employed in sealing: to save the loss of time in surveying the\r\nintricate mass of banks, Capt. Fitz-Roy has hired two of them and has\r\nput officers on them. It took us nearly a month fitting them out; as\r\nsoon as this was finished we came back here, and are now preparing for a\r\nlong cruise to the south. I expect to find the wild mountainous country\r\nof Terra del Fuego very interesting, and after the coast of Patagonia I\r\nshall thoroughly enjoy it.--I had hoped for the credit of Dame Nature,\r\nno such country as this last existed; in sad reality we coasted along\r\n240 miles of sand hillocks; I never knew before, what a horrid ugly\r\nobject a sand hillock is. The famed country of the Rio Plata in my\r\nopinion is not much better: an enormous brackish river, bounded by an\r\ninterminable green plain is enough to make any naturalist groan. So\r\nHurrah for Cape Horn and the Land of Storms. Now that I have had my\r\ngrowl out, which is a privilege sailors take on all occasions, I will\r\nturn the tables and give an account of my doing in Nat. History. I must\r\nhave one more growl: by ill luck the French Government has sent one of\r\nits collectors to the Rio Negro, where he has been working for the last\r\nsix months, and is now gone round the Horn. So that I am very selfishly\r\nafraid he will get the cream of all the good things before me. As I\r\nhave nobody to talk to about my luck and ill luck in collecting, I am\r\ndetermined to vent it all upon you. I have been very lucky with fossil\r\nbones; I have fragments of at least 6 distinct animals: as many of them\r\nare teeth, I trust, shattered and rolled as they have been, they will\r\nbe recognised. I have paid all the attention I am capable of to their\r\ngeological site; but of course it is too long a story for here. 1st, I\r\nhave the tarsi and metatarsi very perfect of a Cavia; 2nd, the upper jaw\r\nand head of some very large animal with four square hollow molars and\r\nthe head greatly protruded in front. I at first thought it belonged\r\neither to the Megalonyx or Megatherium (4/1). The animal may probably\r\nhave been Grypotherium Darwini, Ow. The osseous plates mentioned below\r\nmust have belonged to one of the Glyptodontidae, and not to Megatherium.\r\nWe are indebted to Mr. Kerr for calling our attention to a passage in\r\nBuckland's \"Bridgewater Treatise\" (Volume II., page 20, note), where\r\nbony armour is ascribed to Megatherium.); in confirmation of this in the\r\nsame formation I found a large surface of the osseous polygonal\r\nplates, which \"late observations\" (what are they?) show belong to the\r\nMegatherium. Immediately I saw this I thought they must belong to an\r\nenormous armadillo, living species of which genus are so abundant here.\r\n3rd, The lower jaw of some large animal which, from the molar teeth, I\r\nshould think belonged to the Edentata; 4th, some large molar teeth which\r\nin some respects would seem to belong to an enormous rodent; 5th, also\r\nsome smaller teeth belonging to the same order. If it interests you\r\nsufficiently to unpack them, I shall be very curious to hear something\r\nabout them. Care must be taken in this case not to confuse the tallies.\r\nThey are mingled with marine shells which appear to me identical with\r\nwhat now exist. But since they were deposited in their beds several\r\ngeological changes have taken place in the country. So much for the\r\ndead, and now for the living: there is a poor specimen of a bird which\r\nto my unornithological eyes appears to be a happy mixture of a lark,\r\npigeon and snipe (No. 710). Mr. MacLeay himself never imagined such an\r\ninosculating creature: I suppose it will turn out to be some well-known\r\nbird, although it has quite baffled me. I have taken some interesting\r\nAmphibia; a new Trigonocephalus beautifully connecting in its habits\r\nCrotalus and the Viperidae, and plenty of new (as far as my knowledge\r\ngoes) saurians. As for one little toad, I hope it may be new, that\r\nit may be christened \"diabolicus.\" Milton must allude to this very\r\nindividual when he talks of \"squat like a toad\" (4/2. \"...him [Satan]\r\nthere they [Ithuriel and Zephon] found, Squat like a toad, close at the\r\near of Eve\" (\"Paradise Lost,\" Book IV., line 800).\r\n\r\n\"Formerly Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" had been my chief favourite, and in\r\nmy excursions during the voyage of the 'Beagle,' when I could take only\r\na single volume, I always chose Milton\" (\"Autobiography,\" page 69).);\r\nits colours are by Werner (4/3. Werner's \"Nomenclature of Colours,\"\r\nEdinburgh, 1821.) ink black, vermilion red and buff orange. It has been\r\na splendid cruise for me in Nat. History. Amongst the Pelagic Crustacea,\r\nsome new and curious genera. In the Zoophytes some interesting animals.\r\nAs for one Flustra, if I had not the specimen to back me up nobody would\r\nbelieve in its most anomalous structure. But as for novelty all this is\r\nnothing to a family of pelagic animals which at first sight appear\r\nlike Medusae but are really highly organised. I have examined them\r\nrepeatedly, and certainly from their structure it would be impossible to\r\nplace them in any existing order. Perhaps Salpa is the nearest animal,\r\nalthough the transparency of the body is nearly the only character they\r\nhave in common. I think the dried plants nearly contain all which were\r\nthen (Bahia Blanca) flowering. All the specimens will be packed in\r\ncasks. I think there will be three (before sending this letter I will\r\nspecify dates, etc., etc.). I am afraid you will groan or rather the\r\nfloor of the lecture room will when the casks arrive. Without you I\r\nshould be utterly undone. The small cask contains fish: will you open it\r\nto see how the spirit has stood the evaporation of the Tropics. On board\r\nthe ship everything goes on as well as possible; the only drawback is\r\nthe fearful length of time between this and the day of our return. I do\r\nnot see any limits to it. One year is nearly completed and the second\r\nwill be so, before we even leave the east coast of S. America. And then\r\nour voyage may be said really to have commenced. I know not how I shall\r\nbe able to endure it. The frequency with which I think of all the happy\r\nhours I have spent at Shrewsbury and Cambridge is rather ominous--I\r\ntrust everything to time and fate and will feel my way as I go on.\r\n\r\nNovember 24th.--We have been at Buenos Ayres for a week; it is a fine\r\nlarge city, but such a country, everything is mud, you can go nowhere,\r\nyou can do nothing for mud. In the city I obtained much information\r\nabout the banks of the Uruguay--I hear of limestone with shells, and\r\nbeds of shells in every direction. I hope when we winter in the Plata\r\nto have a most interesting geological excursion into that country: I\r\npurchased fragments (Nos. 837-8) of some enormous bones, which I was\r\nassured belonged to the former giants!! I also procured some seeds--I do\r\nnot know whether they are worth your accepting; if you think so I will\r\nget some more. They are in the box. I have sent to you by the \"Duke of\r\nYork\" packet, commanded by Lieut. Snell, to Falmouth two large casks\r\ncontaining fossil bones, a small cask with fish and a box containing\r\nskins, spirit bottle, etc., and pill-boxes with beetles. Would you be\r\nkind enough to open these latter as they are apt to become mouldy. With\r\nthe exception of the bones the rest of my collection looks very scanty.\r\nRecollect how great a proportion of time is spent at sea. I am always\r\nanxious to hear in what state the things come and any criticisms about\r\nquantity or kind of specimens. In the smaller cask is part of a large\r\nhead, the anterior portions of which are in the other large one. The\r\npacket has arrived and I am in a great bustle. You will not hear from me\r\nfor some months.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 5. TO J.S. HENSLOW. Valparaiso, July 24th 1834.\r\n\r\nA box has just arrived in which were two of your most kind and\r\naffectionate letters. You do not know how happy they have made me. One\r\nis dated December 15th, 1833, the other January 15th of the same year!\r\nBy what fatality it did not arrive sooner I cannot conjecture; I regret\r\nit much, for it contains the information I most wanted, about manner of\r\npacking, etc., etc.: roots with specimens of plants, etc., etc. This I\r\nsuppose was written after the reception of my first cargo of specimens.\r\nNot having heard from you until March of this year I really began to\r\nthink that my collections were so poor, that you were puzzled what to\r\nsay; the case is now quite on the opposite tack; for you are guilty of\r\nexciting all my vain feelings to a most comfortable pitch; if hard\r\nwork will atone for these thoughts, I vow it shall not be spared. It is\r\nrather late, but I will allude to some remarks in the January letter;\r\nyou advise me to send home duplicates of my notes; I have been aware of\r\nthe advantage of doing so; but then at sea to this day, I am invariably\r\nsick, excepting on the finest days, at which times with pelagic animals\r\naround me, I could never bring myself to the task--on shore the most\r\nprudent person could hardly expect such a sacrifice of time. My notes\r\nare becoming bulky. I have about 600 small quarto pages full; about half\r\nof this is Geology--the other imperfect descriptions of animals; with\r\nthe latter I make it a rule only to describe those parts or facts,\r\nwhich cannot be seen in specimens in spirits. I keep my private Journal\r\ndistinct from the above. (N.B. this letter is a most untidy one, but\r\nmy mind is untidy with joy; it is your fault, so you must take the\r\nconsequences.) With respect to the land Planariae, unquestionably they\r\nare not molluscous animals. I read your letters last night, this morning\r\nI took a little walk; by a curious coincidence, I found a new white\r\nspecies of Planaria, and a new to me Vaginulus (third species which I\r\nhave found in S. America) of Cuvier. Amongst the marine mollusques I\r\nhave seen a good many genera, and at Rio found one quite new one. With\r\nrespect to the December letter, I am very glad to hear the four casks\r\narrived safe; since which time you have received another cargo, with\r\nthe bird skins about which you did not understand me. Have any of the\r\nB. Ayrean seeds produced plants? From the Falklands I acknowledged a box\r\nand letter from you; with the letter were a few seeds from Patagonia. At\r\npresent I have specimens enough to make a heavy cargo, but shall wait\r\nas much longer as possible, because opportunities are not now so good\r\nas before. I have just got scent of some fossil bones of a MAMMOTH; what\r\nthey may be I do not know, but if gold or galloping will get them they\r\nshall be mine. You tell me you like hearing how I am going on and what\r\ndoing, and you well may imagine how much I enjoy speaking to any one\r\nupon subjects which I am always thinking about, but never have any one\r\nto talk to [about]. After leaving the Falklands we proceeded to the\r\nRio S. Cruz, following up the river till within twenty miles of the\r\nCordilleras. Unfortunately want of provisions compelled us to return.\r\nThis expedition was most important to me as it was a transverse section\r\nof the great Patagonian formation. I conjecture (an accurate examination\r\nof fossils may possibly determine the point) that the main bed is\r\nsomewhere about the Miocene period (using Mr. Lyell's expression); I\r\njudge from what I have seen of the present shells of Patagonia. This bed\r\ncontains an ENORMOUS field of lava. This is of some interest, as being a\r\nrude approximation to the age of the volcanic part of the great range of\r\nthe Andes. Long before this it existed as a slate and porphyritic\r\nline of hills. I have collected a tolerable quantity of information\r\nrespecting the period and forms of elevations of these plains. I think\r\nthese will be interesting to Mr. Lyell; I had deferred reading his third\r\nvolume till my return: you may guess how much pleasure it gave me; some\r\nof his woodcuts came so exactly into play that I have only to refer to\r\nthem instead of redrawing similar ones. I had my barometer with me,\r\nI only wish I had used it more in these plains. The valley of S. Cruz\r\nappears to me a very curious one; at first it quite baffled me. I\r\nbelieve I can show good reasons for supposing it to have been once a\r\nnorthern straits like to that of Magellan. When I return to England you\r\nwill have some hard work in winnowing my Geology; what little I know I\r\nhave learnt in such a curious fashion that I often feel very doubtful\r\nabout the number of grains [of value?]. Whatever number they may turn\r\nout, I have enjoyed extreme pleasure in collecting them. In T. del Fuego\r\nI collected and examined some corallines; I have observed one fact which\r\nquite startled me: it is that in the genus Sertularia (taken in its\r\nmost restricted form as [used] by Lamoureux) and in two species which,\r\nexcluding comparative expressions, I should find much difficulty in\r\ndescribing as different, the polypi quite and essentially differed in\r\nall their most important and evident parts of structure. I have already\r\nseen enough to be convinced that the present families of corallines as\r\narranged by Lamarck, Cuvier, etc., are highly artificial. It appears\r\nthat they are in the same state [in] which shells were when Linnaeus\r\nleft them for Cuvier to rearrange. I do so wish I was a better hand\r\nat dissecting, I find I can do very little in the minute parts of\r\nstructure; I am forced to take a very rough examination as a type for\r\ndifferent classes of structure. It is most extraordinary I can nowhere\r\nsee in my books one single description of the polypus of any one\r\ncoralline excepting Alcyonium Lobularia of Savigny. I found a curious\r\nlittle stony Cellaria (5/1. Cellaria, a genus of Bryozoa, placed in the\r\nsection Flustrina of the Suborder Chilostomata.) (a new genus) each cell\r\nprovided with long toothed bristle, these are capable of various and\r\nrapid motions. This motion is often simultaneous, and can be produced\r\nby irritation. This fact, as far as I can see, is quite isolated in\r\nthe history of zoophytes (excepting the Flustra with an organ like a\r\nvulture's head); it points out a much more intimate relation between the\r\npolypi than Lamarck is willing to allow. I forgot whether I mentioned\r\nhaving seen something of the manner of propagation in that most\r\nambiguous family, the corallines; I feel pretty well convinced if they\r\nare not plants they are not zoophytes. The \"gemmule\" of a Halimeda\r\ncontained several articulations united, ready to burst their envelope,\r\nand become attached to some basis. I believe in zoophytes universally\r\nthe gemmule produces a single polypus, which afterwards or at the same\r\ntime grows with its cell or single articulation.\r\n\r\nThe \"Beagle\" left the Sts. of Magellan in the middle of winter; she\r\nfound her road out by a wild unfrequented channel; well might Sir J.\r\nNarborough call the west coast South Desolation, \"because it is so\r\ndesolate a land to behold.\" We were driven into Chiloe by some very\r\nbad weather. An Englishman gave me three specimens of that very fine\r\nLucanoidal insect which is described in the \"Camb. Phil. Trans.\" (5/2.\r\n\"Description of Chiasognathus Grantii, a new Lucanideous Insect, etc.\"\r\nby J.F. Stephens (\"Trans. Camb. Phil. Soc.\" Volume IV., page 209,\r\n1833.)), two males and one female. I find Chiloe is composed of lava\r\nand recent deposits. The lavas are curious from abounding in, or rather\r\nbeing in parts composed of pitchstone. If we go to Chiloe in the summer,\r\nI shall reap an entomological harvest. I suppose the Botany both there\r\nand in Chili is well-known.\r\n\r\nI forgot to state that in the four cargoes of specimens there have been\r\nsent three square boxes, each containing four glass bottles. I mention\r\nthis in case they should be stowed beneath geological specimens and thus\r\nescape your notice, perhaps some spirit may be wanted in them. If a\r\nbox arrives from B. Ayres with a Megatherium head the other unnumbered\r\nspecimens, be kind enough to tell me, as I have strong fears for its\r\nsafety. We arrived here the day before yesterday; the views of the\r\ndistant mountains are most sublime and the climate delightful; after our\r\nlong cruise in the damp gloomy climates of the south, to breathe a clear\r\ndry air and feel honest warm sunshine, and eat good fresh roast beef\r\nmust be the summum bonum of human life. I do not like the look of\r\nthe rocks half so much as the beef, there is too much of those rather\r\ninsipid ingredients, mica, quartz and feldspar. Our plans are at present\r\nundecided; there is a good deal of work to the south of Valparaiso and\r\nto the north an indefinite quantity. I look forward to every part with\r\ninterest. I have sent you in this letter a sad dose of egotism, but\r\nrecollect I look up to you as my father in Natural History, and a son\r\nmay talk about himself to his father. In your paternal capacity as\r\nproproctor what a great deal of trouble you appear to have had. How\r\nturbulent Cambridge is become. Before this time it will have regained\r\nits tranquillity. I have a most schoolboy-like wish to be there,\r\nenjoying my holidays. It is a most comfortable reflection to me, that\r\na ship being made of wood and iron, cannot last for ever, and therefore\r\nthis voyage must have an end.\r\n\r\nOctober 28th. This letter has been lying in my portfolio ever since\r\nJuly; I did not send it away because I did not think it worth the\r\npostage; it shall now go with a box of specimens. Shortly after arriving\r\nhere I set out on a geological excursion, and had a very pleasant ramble\r\nabout the base of the Andes. The whole country appears composed of\r\nbreccias (and I imagine slates) which universally have been modified and\r\noftentimes completely altered by the action of fire. The varieties of\r\nporphyry thus produced are endless, but nowhere have I yet met with\r\nrocks which have flowed in a stream; dykes of greenstone are very\r\nnumerous. Modern volcanic action is entirely shut up in the very central\r\nparts (which cannot now be reached on account of the snow) of the\r\nCordilleras. In the south of the R. Maypu I examined the Tertiary\r\nplains, already partially described by M. Gay. (5/3. \"Rapport fait a\r\nl'Academie Royale des Sciences, sur les Travaux Geologiques de M. Gay,\"\r\nby Alex. Brongniart (\"Ann. Sci. Nat.\" Volume XXVIII., page 394, 1833.)\r\nThe fossil shells appear to me to be far more different from the recent\r\nones than in the great Patagonian formation; it will be curious if an\r\nEocene and Miocene (recent there is abundance of) could be proved to\r\nexist in S. America as well as in Europe. I have been much interested\r\nby finding abundance of recent shells at an elevation of 1,300 feet; the\r\ncountry in many places is scattered over with shells but these are all\r\nlittoral ones. So that I suppose the 1,300 feet elevation must be owing\r\nto a succession of small elevations such as in 1822. With these certain\r\nproofs of the recent residence of the ocean over all the lower parts of\r\nChili, the outline of every view and the form of each valley possesses\r\na high interest. Has the action of running water or the sea formed this\r\ndeep ravine? was a question which often arose in my mind and generally\r\nwas answered by finding a bed of recent shells at the bottom. I have\r\nnot sufficient arguments, but I do not believe that more than a small\r\nfraction of the height of the Andes has been formed within the Tertiary\r\nperiod. The conclusion of my excursion was very unfortunate, I became\r\nunwell and could hardly reach this place. I have been in bed for the\r\nlast month, but am now rapidly getting well. I had hoped during\r\nthis time to have made a good collection of insects but it has been\r\nimpossible: I regret the less because Chiloe fairly swarms with\r\ncollectors; there are more naturalists in the country, than carpenters\r\nor shoemakers or any other honest trade.\r\n\r\nIn my letter from the Falkland Islands I said I had fears about a box\r\nwith a Megatherium. I have since heard from B. Ayres that it went to\r\nLiverpool by the brig \"Basingwaithe.\" If you have not received it, it is\r\nI think worth taking some trouble about. In October two casks and a jar\r\nwere sent by H.M.S. \"Samarang\" via Portsmouth. I have no doubt you have\r\nreceived them. With this letter I send a good many bird skins; in the\r\nsame box with them, there is a paper parcel containing pill boxes with\r\ninsects. The other pill boxes require no particular care. You will\r\nsee in two of these boxes some dried Planariae (terrestrial), the only\r\nmethod I have found of preserving them (they are exceedingly brittle).\r\nBy examining the white species I understand some little of the internal\r\nstructure. There are two small parcels of seeds. There are some plants\r\nwhich I hope may interest you, or at least those from Patagonia where\r\nI collected every one in flower. There is a bottle clumsily but I think\r\nsecurely corked containing water and gas from the hot baths of Cauquenes\r\nseated at foot of Andes and long celebrated for medicinal properties. I\r\ntook pains in filling and securing both water and gas. If you can find\r\nany one who likes to analyze them, I should think it would be worth the\r\ntrouble. I have not time at present to copy my few observations about\r\nthe locality, etc., etc., [of] these springs. Will you tell me how the\r\nArachnidae which I have sent home, for instance those from Rio, appear\r\nto be preserved. I have doubts whether it is worth while collecting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe sail the day after to-morrow: our plans are at last limited and\r\ndefinite; I am delighted to say we have bid an eternal adieu to T. del\r\nFuego. The \"Beagle\" will not proceed further south than C. Tres Montes;\r\nfrom which point we survey to the north. The Chonos Archipelago\r\nis delightfully unknown: fine deep inlets running into the\r\nCordilleras--where we can steer by the light of a volcano. I do not\r\nknow which part of the voyage now offers the most attractions. This is a\r\nshamefully untidy letter, but you must forgive me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 6. TO J.S. HENSLOW. April 18th, 1835. Valparaiso.\r\n\r\nI have just returned from Mendoza, having crossed the Cordilleras by two\r\npasses. This trip has added much to my knowledge of the geology of the\r\ncountry. Some of the facts, of the truth of which I in my own mind feel\r\nfully convinced, will appear to you quite absurd and incredible. I will\r\ngive a very short sketch of the structure of these huge mountains. In\r\nthe Portillo pass (the more southern one) travellers have described\r\nthe Cordilleras to consist of a double chain of nearly equal altitude\r\nseparated by a considerable interval. This is the case; and the same\r\nstructure extends to the northward to Uspallata; the little elevation\r\nof the eastern line (here not more than 6,000-7,000 feet.) has caused it\r\nalmost to be overlooked. To begin with the western and principal\r\nchain, we have, where the sections are best seen, an enormous mass of a\r\nporphyritic conglomerate resting on granite. This latter rock seems\r\nto form the nucleus of the whole mass, and is seen in the deep\r\nlateral valleys, injected amongst, upheaving, overturning in the most\r\nextraordinary manner, the overlying strata. The stratification in all\r\nthe mountains is beautifully distinct and from a variety in the colour\r\ncan be seen at great distances. I cannot imagine any part of the world\r\npresenting a more extraordinary scene of the breaking up of the crust\r\nof the globe than the very central parts of the Andes. The upheaval has\r\ntaken place by a great number of (nearly) N. and S. lines; which in most\r\ncases have formed as many anticlinal and synclinal ravines; the strata\r\nin the highest pinnacles are almost universally inclined at an angle\r\nfrom 70 deg to 80 deg. I cannot tell you how I enjoyed some of these\r\nviews--it is worth coming from England, once to feel such intense\r\ndelight; at an elevation from 10 to 12,000 feet there is a transparency\r\nin the air, and a confusion of distances and a sort of stillness which\r\ngives the sensation of being in another world, and when to this is\r\njoined the picture so plainly drawn of the great epochs of violence, it\r\ncauses in the mind a most strange assemblage of ideas.\r\n\r\nThe formation I call Porphyritic Conglomerates is the most important and\r\nmost developed one in Chili: from a great number of sections I find it\r\na true coarse conglomerate or breccia, which by every step in a slow\r\ngradation passes into a fine claystone-porphyry; the pebbles and cement\r\nbecoming porphyritic till at last all is blended in one compact rock.\r\nThe porphyries are excessively abundant in this chain. I feel sure at\r\nleast 4/5ths of them have been thus produced from sedimentary beds in\r\nsitu. There are porphyries which have been injected from below amongst\r\nstrata, and others ejected, which have flowed in streams; it is\r\nremarkable, and I could show specimens of this rock produced in these\r\nthree methods, which cannot be distinguished. It is a great mistake\r\nconsidering the Cordilleras here as composed of rocks which have flowed\r\nin streams. In this range I nowhere saw a fragment, which I believe to\r\nhave thus originated, although the road passes at no great distance\r\nfrom the active volcanoes. The porphyries, conglomerate, sandstone and\r\nquartzose sandstone and limestones alternate and pass into each\r\nother many times, overlying (where not broken through by the granite)\r\nclay-slate. In the upper parts, the sandstone begins to alternate with\r\ngypsum, till at last we have this substance of a stupendous thickness.\r\nI really think the formation is in some places (it varies much) nearly\r\n2,000 feet thick, it occurs often with a green (epidote?) siliceous\r\nsandstone and snow-white marble; it resembles that found in the Alps in\r\ncontaining large concretions of a crystalline marble of a blackish grey\r\ncolour. The upper beds which form some of the higher pinnacles consist\r\nof layers of snow-white gypsum and red compact sandstone, from the\r\nthickness of paper to a few feet, alternating in an endless round.\r\nThe rock has a most curiously painted appearance. At the pass of the\r\nPeuquenes in this formation, where however a black rock like clay-slate,\r\nwithout many laminae, occurring with a pale limestone, has replaced the\r\nred sandstone, I found abundant impressions of shells. The elevation\r\nmust be between 12 and 13,000 feet. A shell which I believe is the\r\nGryphaea is the most abundant--an Ostrea, Turratella, Ammonites, small\r\nbivalves, Terebratulae (?). Perhaps some good conchologist (6/1. Some of\r\nthese genera are mentioned by Darwin (\"Geol. Obs.\" page 181) as having\r\nbeen named for him by M. D'Orbigny.) will be able to give a guess, to\r\nwhat grand division of the formations of Europe these organic remains\r\nbear most resemblance. They are exceedingly imperfect and few. It\r\nwas late in the season and the situation particularly dangerous for\r\nsnow-storms. I did not dare to delay, otherwise a grand harvest might\r\nhave been reaped. So much for the western line; in the Portillo pass,\r\nproceeding eastward, we meet an immense mass of conglomerate, dipping to\r\nthe west 45 deg, which rest on micaceous sandstone, etc., etc., upheaved\r\nand converted into quartz-rock penetrated by dykes from the very\r\ngrand mass of protogine (large crystals of quartz, red feldspar, and\r\noccasional little chlorite). Now this conglomerate which reposes on and\r\ndips from the protogene 45 deg consists of the peculiar rocks of the\r\nfirst described chain, pebbles of the black rock with shells, green\r\nsandstone, etc., etc. It is hence manifest that the upheaval (and\r\ndeposition at least of part) of the grand eastern chain is entirely\r\nposterior to the western. To the north in the Uspallata pass, we have\r\nalso a fact of the same class. Bear this in mind: it will help to\r\nmake you believe what follows. I have said the Uspallata range is\r\ngeologically, although only 6,000-7,000 feet, a continuation of the\r\ngrand eastern chain. It has its nucleus of granite, consists of grand\r\nbeds of various crystalline rocks, which I can feel no doubt are\r\nsubaqueous lavas alternating with sandstone, conglomerates and white\r\naluminous beds (like decomposed feldspar) with many other curious\r\nvarieties of sedimentary deposits. These lavas and sandstones alterate\r\nvery many times, and are quite conformable one to the other. During two\r\ndays of careful examination I said to myself at least fifty times, how\r\nexactly like (only rather harder) these beds are to those of the\r\nupper Tertiary strata of Patagonia, Chiloe and Concepcion, without\r\nthe possible identity ever having occurred to me. At last there was\r\nno resisting the conclusion. I could not expect shells, for they never\r\noccur in this formation; but lignite or carbonaceous shale ought to\r\nbe found. I had previously been exceedingly puzzled by meeting in\r\nthe sandstone, thin layers (few inches to feet thick) of a brecciated\r\npitchstone. I strongly suspect the underlying granite has altered\r\nsuch beds into this pitchstone. The silicified wood (particularly\r\ncharacteristic) was yet absent. The conviction that I was on the\r\nTertiary strata was so strong by this time in my mind, that on the\r\nthird day in the midst of lavas and [? masses] of granite I began my\r\napparently forlorn hunt. How do you think I succeeded? In an escarpement\r\nof compact greenish sandstone, I found a small wood of petrified trees\r\nin a vertical position, or rather the strata were inclined about 20-30\r\ndeg to one point and the trees 70 deg to the opposite one. That is,\r\nthey were before the tilt truly vertical. The sandstone consists of\r\nmany layers, and is marked by the concentric lines of the bark (I have\r\nspecimens); 11 are perfectly silicified and resemble the dicotyledonous\r\nwood which I have found at Chiloe and Concepcion (6/2. \"Geol. Obs.\" page\r\n202. Specimens of the silicified wood were examined by Robert Brown,\r\nand determined by him as coniferous, \"partaking of the characters of the\r\nAraucarian tribe, with some curious points of affinity with the yew.\");\r\nthe others (30-40) I only know to be trees from the analogy of form\r\nand position; they consist of snow-white columns (like Lot's wife) of\r\ncoarsely crystalline carb. of lime. The largest shaft is 7 feet. They\r\nare all close together, within 100 yards, and about the same level:\r\nnowhere else could I find any. It cannot be doubted that the layers\r\nof fine sandstone have quietly been deposited between a clump of trees\r\nwhich were fixed by their roots. The sandstone rests on lava, is covered\r\nby a great bed apparently about 1,000 feet thick of black augitic lava,\r\nand over this there are at least 5 grand alternations of such rocks and\r\naqueous sedimentary deposits, amounting in thickness to several thousand\r\nfeet. I am quite afraid of the only conclusion which I can draw from\r\nthis fact, namely that there must have been a depression in the surface\r\nof the land to that amount. But neglecting this consideration, it was a\r\nmost satisfactory support of my presumption of the Tertiary (I mean by\r\nTertiary, that the shells of the period were closely allied, or some\r\nidentical, to those which now live, as in the lower beds of Patagonia)\r\nage of this eastern chain. A great part of the proof must remain upon my\r\nipse dixit of a mineralogical resemblance with those beds whose age\r\nis known, and the character of which resemblance is to be subject\r\nto infinite variation, passing from one variety to another by a\r\nconcretionary structure. I hardly expect you to believe me, when it is\r\na consequence of this view that granite, which forms peaks of a height\r\nprobably of 14,000 feet, has been fluid in the Tertiary period; that\r\nstrata of that period are altered by its heat, and are traversed by\r\ndykes from the mass. That these strata have also probably undergone an\r\nimmense depression, that they are now inclined at high angles and form\r\nregular or complicated anticlinal lines. To complete the climax and seal\r\nyour disbelief, these same sedimentary strata and lavas are traversed by\r\nVERY NUMEROUS, true metallic veins of iron, copper, arsenic, silver and\r\ngold, and these can be traced to the underlying granite. A gold mine has\r\nbeen worked close to the clump of silicified trees. If when you see my\r\nspecimens, sections and account, you should think that there is\r\npretty strong presumptive evidence of the above facts, it appears\r\nvery important; for the structure, and size of this chain will bear\r\ncomparison with any in the world, and that this all should have been\r\nproduced in so very recent a period is indeed wonderful. In my own\r\nmind I am quite convinced of the reality of this. I can anyhow most\r\nconscientiously say that no previously formed conjecture warped my\r\njudgment. As I have described so did I actually observe the facts. But I\r\nwill have some mercy and end this most lengthy account of my geological\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nOn some of the large patches of perpetual snow, I found the famous red\r\nsnow of the Arctic countries; I send with this letter my observations\r\nand a piece of paper on which I tried to dry some specimens. If the fact\r\nis new and you think it worth while, either yourself examine them or\r\nsend them to whoever has described the specimens from the north and\r\npublish a notice in any of the periodicals. I also send a small bottle\r\nwith two lizards, one of them is viviparous as you will see by the\r\naccompanying notice. A M. Gay--a French naturalist--has already\r\npublished in one of the newspapers of this country a similar statement\r\nand probably has forwarded to Paris some account; as the fact appears\r\nsingular would it not be worth while to hand over the specimens to some\r\ngood lizardologist and comparative anatomist to publish an account of\r\ntheir internal structure? Do what you think fit.\r\n\r\nThis letter will go with a cargo of specimens from Coquimbo. I shall\r\nwrite to let you know when they are sent off. In the box there are two\r\nbags of seeds, one [from the] valleys of the Cordilleras 5,000-10,000\r\nfeet high, the soil and climate exceedingly dry, soil very light and\r\nstony, extremes in temperature; the other chiefly from the dry sandy\r\nTraversia of Mendoza 3,000 feet more or less. If some of the bushes\r\nshould grow but not be healthy, try a slight sprinkling of salt and\r\nsaltpetre. The plain is saliferous. All the flowers in the Cordilleras\r\nappear to be autumnal flowerers--they were all in blow and seed, many of\r\nthem very pretty. I gathered them as I rode along on the hill sides.\r\nIf they will but choose to come up, I have no doubt many would be great\r\nrarities. In the Mendoza bag there are the seeds or berries of what\r\nappears to be a small potato plant with a whitish flower. They grow\r\nmany leagues from where any habitation could ever have existed owing to\r\nabsence of water. Amongst the Chonos dried plants, you will see a fine\r\nspecimen of the wild potato, growing under a most opposite climate, and\r\nunquestionably a true wild potato. It must be a distinct species from\r\nthat of the Lower Cordilleras one. Perhaps as with the banana, distinct\r\nspecies are now not to be distinguished in their varieties produced by\r\ncultivation. I cannot copy out the few remarks about the Chonos potato.\r\nWith the specimens there is a bundle of old papers and notebooks. Will\r\nyou take care of them; in case I should lose my notes, these might be\r\nuseful. I do not send home any insects because they must be troublesome\r\nto you, and now so little more of the voyage remains unfinished I can\r\nwell take charge of them. In two or three days I set out for Coquimbo by\r\nland; the \"Beagle\" calls for me in the beginning of June. So that I\r\nhave six weeks more to enjoy geologising over these curious mountains\r\nof Chili. There is at present a bloody revolution in Peru. The Commodore\r\nhas gone there, and in the hurry has carried our letters with him;\r\nperhaps amongst them there will be one from you. I wish I had the old\r\nCommodore here, I would shake some consideration for others into his old\r\nbody. From Coquimbo you will again hear from me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 7. TO J.S. HENSLOW. Lima, July 12th, 1835.\r\n\r\nThis is the last letter which I shall ever write to you from the shores\r\nof America, and for this reason I send it. In a few days time the\r\n\"Beagle\" will sail for the Galapagos Islands. I look forward with joy\r\nand interest to this, both as being somewhat nearer to England and for\r\nthe sake of having a good look at an active volcano. Although we have\r\nseen lava in abundance, I have never yet beheld the crater. I sent by\r\nH.M.S. \"Conway\" two large boxes of specimens. The \"Conway\" sailed the\r\nlatter end of June. With them were letters for you, since that time I\r\nhave travelled by land from Valparaiso to Copiapo and seen something\r\nmore of the Cordilleras. Some of my geological views have been,\r\nsubsequently to the last letter, altered. I believe the upper mass\r\nof strata is not so very modern as I supposed. This last journey has\r\nexplained to me much of the ancient history of the Cordilleras. I feel\r\nsure they formerly consisted of a chain of volcanoes from which enormous\r\nstreams of lava were poured forth at the bottom of the sea. These\r\nalternate with sedimentary beds to a vast thickness; at a subsequent\r\nperiod these volcanoes must have formed islands, from which have been\r\nproduced strata of several thousand feet thick of coarse conglomerate.\r\n(7/1. See \"Geological Observations on South America\" (London, 1846),\r\nChapter VII.: \"Central Chile; Structure of the Cordillera.\") These\r\nislands were covered with fine trees; in the conglomerate, I found one\r\n15 feet in circumference perfectly silicified to the very centre. The\r\nalternations of compact crystalline rocks (I cannot doubt subaqueous\r\nlavas), and sedimentary beds, now upheaved fractured and indurated, form\r\nthe main range of the Andes. The formation was produced at the time when\r\nammonites, gryphites, oysters, Pecten, Mytilus, etc., etc., lived. In\r\nthe central parts of Chili the structure of the lower beds is rendered\r\nvery obscure by the metamorphic action which has rendered even the\r\ncoarsest conglomerates porphyritic. The Cordilleras of the Andes so\r\nworthy of admiration from the grandeur of their dimensions, rise in\r\ndignity when it is considered that since the period of ammonites, they\r\nhave formed a marked feature in the geography of the globe. The geology\r\nof these mountains pleased me in one respect; when reading Lyell, it had\r\nalways struck me that if the crust of the world goes on changing in a\r\ncircle, there ought to be somewhere found formations which, having the\r\nage of the great European Secondary beds, should possess the structure\r\nof Tertiary rocks or those formed amidst islands and in limited basins.\r\nNow the alternations of lava and coarse sediment which form the upper\r\nparts of the Andes, correspond exactly to what would accumulate under\r\nsuch circumstances. In consequence of this, I can only very roughly\r\nseparate into three divisions the varying strata (perhaps 8,000 feet\r\nthick) which compose these mountains. I am afraid you will tell me\r\nto learn my ABC to know quartz from feldspar before I indulge in such\r\nspeculations. I lately got hold of a report on M. Dessalines D'Orbigny's\r\nlabours in S. America (7/2. \"Voyage dans l'Amerique Meridionale, etc.\"\r\n(A. Dessalines D'Orbigny).); I experienced rather a debasing degree of\r\nvexation to find he has described the Geology of the Pampas, and that I\r\nhave had some hard riding for nothing, it was however gratifying that my\r\nconclusions are the same, as far as I can collect, with his results. It\r\nis also capital that the whole of Bolivia will be described. I hope to\r\nbe able to connect his geology of that country with mine of Chili.\r\nAfter leaving Copiapo, we touched at Iquique. I visited but do not quite\r\nunderstand the position of the nitrate of soda beds. Here in Peru, from\r\nthe state of anarchy, I can make no expedition.\r\n\r\nI hear from home, that my brother is going to send me a box with books,\r\nand a letter from you. It is very unfortunate that I cannot receive this\r\nbefore we reach Sydney, even if it ever gets safely so far. I shall not\r\nhave another opportunity for many months of again writing to you. Will\r\nyou have the charity to send me one more letter (as soon as this reaches\r\nyou) directed to the C. of Good Hope. Your letters besides affording\r\nme the greatest delight always give me a fresh stimulus for exertion.\r\nExcuse this geological prosy letter, and farewell till you hear from me\r\nat Sydney, and see me in the autumn of 1836.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 8. TO JOSIAH WEDGWOOD. [Shrewsbury, October 5th, 1836.]\r\n\r\nMy dear Uncle\r\n\r\nThe \"Beagle\" arrived at Falmouth on Sunday evening, and I reached home\r\nlate last night. My head is quite confused with so much delight, but I\r\ncannot allow my sisters to tell you first how happy I am to see all\r\nmy dear friends again. I am obliged to return in three or four days\r\nto London, where the \"Beagle\" will be paid off, and then I shall pay\r\nShrewsbury a longer visit. I am most anxious once again to see Maer, and\r\nall its inhabitants, so that in the course of two or three weeks, I hope\r\nin person to thank you, as being my first Lord of the Admiralty. (8/1.)\r\nReaders of the \"Life and Letters\" will remember that it was to Josiah\r\nWedgwood that Darwin owed the great opportunity of his life (\"Life and\r\nLetters,\" Volume I., page 59), and it was fitting that he should report\r\nhimself to his \"first Lord of the Admiralty.\" The present letter clears\r\nup a small obscurity to which Mr. Poulton has called attention (\"Charles\r\nDarwin and the Theory of Natural Selection,\" \"Century\" Series, 1896,\r\npage 25). Writing to Fitz-Roy from Shrewsbury on October 6th, Darwin\r\nsays, \"I arrived here yesterday morning at breakfast time.\" This refers\r\nto his arrival at his father's house, after having slept at the inn. The\r\ndate of his arrival in Shrewsbury was, therefore, October 4th, as given\r\nin the \"Life and Letters,\" I., page 272.) The entries in his Diary\r\nare:--October 2, 1831. Took leave of my home. October 4, 1836. Reached\r\nShrewsbury after absence of 5 years and 2 days.) I am so very happy I\r\nhardly know what I am writing. Believe me your most affectionate nephew,\r\n\r\nCHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 9. TO C. LYELL. Shrewsbury, Monday [November 12th, 1838].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell\r\n\r\nI suppose you will be in Hart St. (9/1. Sir Charles Lyell lived at 16,\r\nHart Street, Bloomsbury.) to-morrow [or] the 14th. I write because\r\nI cannot avoid wishing to be the first person to tell Mrs. Lyell and\r\nyourself, that I have the very good, and shortly since [i.e. until\r\nlately] very unexpected fortune of going to be married! The lady is my\r\ncousin Miss Emma Wedgwood, the sister of Hensleigh Wedgwood, and of the\r\nelder brother who married my sister, so we are connected by manifold\r\nties, besides on my part, by the most sincere love and hearty gratitude\r\nto her for accepting such a one as myself.\r\n\r\nI determined when last at Maer to try my chance, but I hardly expected\r\nsuch good fortune would turn up for me. I shall be in town in the middle\r\nor latter end of the ensuing week. (9/2. Mr. Darwin was married on\r\nJanuary 29th, 1839 (see \"Life and Letters,\" I., page 299). The present\r\nletter was written the day after he had become engaged.) I fear you\r\nwill say I might very well have left my story untold till we met. But\r\nI deeply feel your kindness and friendship towards me, which in truth\r\nI may say, has been one chief source of happiness to me, ever since\r\nmy return to England: so you must excuse me. I am well sure that Mrs.\r\nLyell, who has sympathy for every one near her, will give me her hearty\r\ncongratulations.\r\n\r\nBelieve me my dear Lyell Yours most truly obliged CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n(PLATE: MRS. DARWIN. Walker and Cockerell, ph. sc.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 10. TO EMMA WEDGWOOD. Sunday Night. Athenaeum. [January 20th,\r\n1839.]\r\n\r\n...I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed my Maer visit,--I felt in\r\nanticipation my future tranquil life: how I do hope you may be as happy\r\nas I know I shall be: but it frightens me, as often as I think of what\r\na family you have been one of. I was thinking this morning how it came,\r\nthat I, who am fond of talking and am scarcely ever out of spirits,\r\nshould so entirely rest my notions of happiness on quietness, and a good\r\ndeal of solitude: but I believe the explanation is very simple and I\r\nmention it because it will give you hopes, that I shall gradually grow\r\nless of a brute, it is that during the five years of my voyage (and\r\nindeed I may add these two last) which from the active manner in which\r\nthey have been passed, may be said to be the commencement of my real\r\nlife, the whole of my pleasure was derived from what passed in my mind,\r\nwhile admiring views by myself, travelling across the wild deserts\r\nor glorious forests or pacing the deck of the poor little \"Beagle\" at\r\nnight. Excuse this much egotism,--I give it you because I think you will\r\nhumanize me, and soon teach me there is greater happiness than building\r\ntheories and accumulating facts in silence and solitude. My own dearest\r\nEmma, I earnestly pray, you may never regret the great, and I will add\r\nvery good, deed, you are to perform on the Tuesday: my own dear future\r\nwife, God bless you...The Lyells called on me to-day after church; as\r\nLyell was so full of geology he was obliged to disgorge,--and I dine\r\nthere on Tuesday for an especial confidence. I was quite ashamed of\r\nmyself to-day, for we talked for half an hour, unsophisticated geology,\r\nwith poor Mrs. Lyell sitting by, a monument of patience. I want practice\r\nin ill-treatment the female sex,--I did not observe Lyell had any\r\ncompunction; I hope to harden my conscience in time: few husbands\r\nseem to find it difficult to effect this. Since my return I have taken\r\nseveral looks, as you will readily believe, into the drawing-room; I\r\nsuppose my taste [for] harmonious colours is already deteriorated, for\r\nI declare the room begins to look less ugly. I take so much pleasure\r\nin the house (10/1. No. 12, Upper Gower Street, is now No. 110, Gower\r\nStreet, and forms part of a block inhabited by Messrs. Shoolbred's\r\nemployes. We are indebted, for this information, to Mr. Wheatley, of the\r\nSociety of Arts.), I declare I am just like a great overgrown child with\r\na new toy; but then, not like a real child, I long to have a co-partner\r\nand possessor.\r\n\r\n(10/2. The following passage is taken from the MS. copy of the\r\n\"Autobiography;\" it was not published in the \"Life and Letters\" which\r\nappeared in Mrs. Darwin's lifetime:--)\r\n\r\nYou all know your mother, and what a good mother she has ever been to\r\nall of you. She has been my greatest blessing, and I can declare that in\r\nmy whole life I have never heard her utter one word I would rather have\r\nbeen unsaid. She has never failed in kindest sympathy towards me, and\r\nhas borne with the utmost patience my frequent complaints of ill-health\r\nand discomfort. I do not believe she has ever missed an opportunity of\r\ndoing a kind action to any one near her. I marvel at my good fortune\r\nthat she, so infinitely my superior in every single moral quality,\r\nconsented to be my wife. She has been my wise adviser and cheerful\r\ncomforter throughout life, which without her would have been during a\r\nvery long period a miserable one from ill-health. She has earned the\r\nlove of every soul near her.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 11. C. LYELL TO C. DARWIN. [July?, 1841?].\r\n\r\n(11/1. Lyell started on his first visit to the United States in July,\r\n1841, and was absent thirteen months. Darwin returned to London July\r\n23rd, 1841, after a prolonged absence; he may, therefore, have missed\r\nseeing Lyell. Assuming the date 1841 to be correct, it would seem\r\nthat the plan of living in the country was formed a year before it was\r\nactually carried out.)\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that your father did rightly in persuading you to stay\r\n[at Shrewsbury], but we were much disappointed in not seeing you before\r\nour start for a year's absence. I cannot tell you how often since your\r\nlong illness I have missed the friendly intercourse which we had so\r\nfrequently before, and on which I built more than ever after your\r\nmarriage. It will not happen easily that twice in one's life, even in\r\nthe large world of London, a congenial soul so occupied with precisely\r\nthe same pursuits and with an independence enabling him to pursue them\r\nwill fall so nearly in my way, and to have had it snatched from me with\r\nthe prospect of your residence somewhat far off is a privation I feel as\r\na very great one. I hope you will not, like Herschell, get far off from\r\na railway.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 12. TO CATHERINE DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(12/1. The following letter was written to his sister Catherine about\r\ntwo months before Charles Darwin settled at Down:--)\r\n\r\nSunday [July 1842].\r\n\r\nYou must have been surprised at not having heard sooner about the house.\r\nEmma and I only returned yesterday afternoon from sleeping there. I will\r\ngive you in detail, as my father would like, MY opinion on it--Emma's\r\nslightly differs. Position:--about 1/4 of a mile from the small village\r\nof Down in Kent--16 miles from St. Paul's--8 1/2 miles from station\r\n(with many trains) which station is only 10 from London. This is bad,\r\nas the drive from [i.e. on account of] the hills is long. I calculate we\r\nare two hours going from London Bridge. Village about forty houses with\r\nold walnut trees in the middle where stands an old flint church and the\r\nlanes meet. Inhabitants very respectable--infant school--grown up people\r\ngreat musicians--all touch their hats as in Wales and sit at their open\r\ndoors in the evening; no high road leads through the village. The little\r\npot-house where we slept is a grocer's shop, and the landlord is the\r\ncarpenter--so you may guess the style of the village. There are butcher\r\nand baker and post-office. A carrier goes weekly to London and calls\r\nanywhere for anything in London and takes anything anywhere. On the road\r\n[from London] to the village, on a fine day the scenery is absolutely\r\nbeautiful: from close to our house the view is very distant and rather\r\nbeautiful, but the house being situated on a rather high tableland has\r\nsomewhat of a desolate air. There is a most beautiful old farm-house,\r\nwith great thatched barns and old stumps of oak trees, like that of\r\nSkelton, one field off. The charm of the place to me is that almost\r\nevery field is intersected (as alas is ours) by one or more foot-paths.\r\nI never saw so many walks in any other county. The country is\r\nextraordinarily rural and quiet with narrow lanes and high hedges and\r\nhardly any ruts. It is really surprising to think London is only 16\r\nmiles off. The house stands very badly, close to a tiny lane and near\r\nanother man's field. Our field is 15 acres and flat, looking into\r\nflat-bottomed valleys on both sides, but no view from the drawing-room,\r\nwhich faces due south, except on our flat field and bits of rather ugly\r\ndistant horizon. Close in front there are some old (very productive)\r\ncherry trees, walnut trees, yew, Spanish chestnut, pear, old larch,\r\nScotch fir and silver fir and old mulberry trees, [which] make rather a\r\npretty group. They give the ground an old look, but from not flourishing\r\nmuch they also give it rather a desolate look. There are quinces and\r\nmedlars and plums with plenty of fruit, and Morello cherries; but few\r\napples. The purple magnolia flowers against the house. There is a really\r\nfine beech in view in our hedge. The kitchen garden is a detestable slip\r\nand the soil looks wretched from the quantity of chalk flints, but I\r\nreally believe it is productive. The hedges grow well all round our\r\nfield, and it is a noted piece of hayland. This year the crop was\r\nbad, but was bought, as it stood, for 2 pounds per acre--that is 30\r\npounds--the purchaser getting it in. Last year it was sold for 45\r\npounds--no manure was put on in the interval. Does not this sound well?\r\nAsk my father. Does the mulberry and magnolia show it is not very cold\r\nin winter, which I fear is the case? Tell Susan it is 9 miles from\r\nKnole Park and 6 from Westerham, at which places I hear the scenery\r\nis beautiful. There are many very odd views round our house--deepish\r\nflat-bottomed valley and nice farm-house, but big, white, ugly, fallow\r\nfields;--much wheat grown here. House ugly, looks neither old nor\r\nnew--walls two feet thick--windows rather small--lower story rather low.\r\nCapital study 18 x 18. Dining-room 21 x 18. Drawing-room can easily be\r\nadded to: is 21 x 15. Three stories, plenty of bedrooms. We could hold\r\nthe Hensleighs and you and Susan and Erasmus all together. House in good\r\nrepair. Mr. Cresy a few years ago laid out for the owner 1,500 pounds\r\nand made a new roof. Water-pipes over house--two bath-rooms--pretty good\r\noffices and good stable-yard, etc., and a cottage. I believe the price\r\nis about 2,200 pounds, and I have no doubt I shall get it for one year\r\non lease first to try, so that I shall do nothing to the house at first\r\n(last owner kept three cows, one horse, and one donkey, and sold\r\nsome hay annually from one field). I have no doubt if we complete the\r\npurchase I shall at least save 1,000 pounds over Westcroft, or any other\r\nhouse we have seen. Emma was at first a good deal disappointed, and at\r\nthe country round the house; the day was gloomy and cold with N.E. wind.\r\nShe likes the actual field and house better than I; the house is just\r\nsituated as she likes for retirement, not too near or too far from other\r\nhouses, but she thinks the country looks desolate. I think all chalk\r\ncountries do, but I am used to Cambridgeshire, which is ten times worse.\r\nEmma is rapidly coming round. She was dreadfully bad with toothache and\r\nheadache in the evening and Friday, but in coming back yesterday she was\r\nso delighted with the scenery for the first few miles from Down, that it\r\nhas worked a great change in her. We go there again the first fine day\r\nEmma is able, and we then finally settle what to do.\r\n\r\n(12/2. The following fragmentary \"Account of Down\" was found among Mr.\r\nDarwin's papers after the publication of the \"Life and Letters.\" It\r\ngives the impression that he intended to write a natural history diary\r\nafter the manner of Gilbert White, but there is no evidence that this\r\nwas actually the case.)\r\n\r\n1843. May 15th.--The first peculiarity which strikes a stranger\r\nunaccustomed to a hilly chalk country is the valleys, with their steep\r\nrounded bottoms--not furrowed with the smallest rivulet. On the road to\r\nDown from Keston a mound has been thrown across a considerable valley,\r\nbut even against this mound there is no appearance of even a small\r\npool of water having collected after the heaviest rains. The water\r\nall percolates straight downwards. Ascertain average depth of wells,\r\ninclination of strata, and springs. Does the water from this country\r\ncrop out in springs in Holmsdale or in the valley of the Thames? Examine\r\nthe fine springs in Holmsdale.\r\n\r\nThe valleys on this platform sloping northward, but exceedingly even,\r\ngenerally run north and south; their sides near the summits generally\r\nbecome suddenly more abrupt, and are fringed with narrow strips, or, as\r\nthey are here called, \"shaws\" of wood, sometimes merely by hedgerows run\r\nwild. The sudden steepness may generally be perceived, as just before\r\nascending to Cudham Wood, and at Green Hill, where one of the lanes\r\ncrosses these valleys. These valleys are in all probability ancient\r\nsea-bays, and I have sometimes speculated whether this sudden steepening\r\nof the sides does not mark the edges of vertical cliffs formed when\r\nthese valleys were filled with sea-water, as would naturally happen in\r\nstrata such as the chalk.\r\n\r\nIn most countries the roads and footpaths ascend along the bottoms of\r\nvalleys, but here this is scarcely ever the case. All the villages and\r\nmost of the ancient houses are on the platforms or narrow strips of flat\r\nland between the parallel valleys. Is this owing to the summits having\r\nexisted from the most ancient times as open downs and the valleys having\r\nbeen filled up with brushwood? I have no evidence of this, but it is\r\ncertain that most of the farmhouses on the flat land are very ancient.\r\nThere is one peculiarity which would help to determine the footpaths\r\nto run along the summits instead of the bottom of the valleys, in that\r\nthese latter in the middle are generally covered, even far more thickly\r\nthan the general surface, with broken flints. This bed of flints, which\r\ngradually thins away on each side, can be seen from a long distance in a\r\nnewly ploughed or fallow field as a whitish band. Every stone which ever\r\nrolls after heavy rain or from the kick of an animal, ever so little,\r\nall tend to the bottom of the valleys; but whether this is sufficient\r\nto account for their number I have sometimes doubted, and have been\r\ninclined to apply to the case Lyell's theory of solution by rain-water,\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe flat summit-land is covered with a bed of stiff red clay, from a\r\nfew feet in thickness to as much, I believe, as twenty feet: this\r\n[bed], though lying immediately on the chalk, and abounding with\r\ngreat, irregularly shaped, unrolled flints, often with the colour and\r\nappearance of huge bones, which were originally embedded in the chalk,\r\ncontains not a particle of carbonate of lime. This bed of red clay lies\r\non a very irregular surface, and often descends into deep round wells,\r\nthe origin of which has been explained by Lyell. In these cavities are\r\npatches of sand like sea-sand, and like the sand which alternates\r\nwith the great beds of small pebbles derived from the wear-and-tear of\r\nchalk-flints, which form Keston, Hayes and Addington Commons. Near Down\r\na rounded chalk-flint is a rarity, though some few do occur; and I have\r\nnot yet seen a stone of distant origin, which makes a difference--at\r\nleast to geological eyes--in the very aspect of the country, compared\r\nwith all the northern counties.\r\n\r\nThe chalk-flints decay externally, which, according to Berzelius (\"Edin.\r\nNew Phil. Journal,\" late number), is owing to the flints containing a\r\nsmall proportion of alkali; but, besides this external decay, the whole\r\nbody is affected by exposure of a few years, so that they will not break\r\nwith clean faces for building.\r\n\r\nThis bed of red clay, which renders the country very slippery in the\r\nwinter months from October to April, does not cover the sides of the\r\nvalleys; these, when ploughed, show the white chalk, which tint shades\r\naway lower in the valley, as insensibly as a colour laid on by a\r\npainter's brush.\r\n\r\nNearly all the land is ploughed, and is often left fallow, which gives\r\nthe country a naked red look, or not unfrequently white, from a covering\r\nof chalk laid on by the farmers. Nobody seems at all aware on what\r\nprinciple fresh chalk laid on land abounding with lime does it any good.\r\nThis, however, is said to have been the practice of the country ever\r\nsince the period of the Romans, and at present the many white pits on\r\nthe hill sides, which so frequently afford a picturesque contrast with\r\nthe overhanging yew trees, are all quarried for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe number of different kinds of bushes in the hedgerows, entwined\r\nby traveller's joy and the bryonies, is conspicuous compared with the\r\nhedges of the northern counties.\r\n\r\nMarch 25th [1844?].--The first period of vegetation, and the banks are\r\nclothed with pale-blue violets to an extent I have never seen equalled,\r\nand with primroses. A few days later some of the copses were beautifully\r\nenlivened by Ranunculus auricomus, wood anemones, and a white Stellaria.\r\nAgain, subsequently, large areas were brilliantly blue with bluebells.\r\nThe flowers are here very beautiful, and the number of flowers; [and]\r\nthe darkness of the blue of the common little Polygala almost equals it\r\nto an alpine gentian.\r\n\r\nThere are large tracts of woodland, [cut down] about once every ten\r\nyears; some of these enclosures seem to be very ancient. On the south\r\nside of Cudham Wood a beech hedge has grown to Brobdignagian size, with\r\nseveral of the huge branches crossing each other and firmly grafted\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nLarks abound here, and their songs sound most agreeably on all sides;\r\nnightingales are common. Judging from an odd cooing note, something like\r\nthe purring of a cat, doves are very common in the woods.\r\n\r\nJune 25th.--The sainfoin fields are now of the most beautiful pink, and\r\nfrom the number of hive-bees frequenting them the humming noise is quite\r\nextraordinary. This humming is rather deeper than the humming overhead,\r\nwhich has been continuous and loud during all these last hot days over\r\nalmost every field. The labourers here say it is made by \"air-bees,\"\r\nand one man, seeing a wild bee in a flower different from the hive kind,\r\nremarked: \"That, no doubt, is an air-bee.\" This noise is considered as a\r\nsign of settled fair weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.II.--EVOLUTION, 1844-1858.\r\n\r\n(Chapter II./1. Since the publication of the \"Life and Letters,\" Mr.\r\nHuxley's obituary notice of Charles Darwin has appeared. (Chapter II./2.\r\n\"Proc. R. Soc.\" volume 44, 1888, and \"Collected Essays (Darwiniana),\"\r\npage 253, 1899.) This masterly paper is, in our opinion, the finest\r\nof the great series of Darwinian essays which we owe to Mr. Huxley.\r\nWe would venture to recommend it to our readers as the best possible\r\nintroduction to these pages. There is, however, one small point in which\r\nwe differ from Mr. Huxley. In discussing the growth of Mr. Darwin's\r\nevolutionary views, Mr. Huxley quotes from the autobiography (Chapter\r\nII./3. \"Life and Letters,\" I., page 82. Some account of the origin of\r\nhis evolutionary views is given in a letter to Jenyns (Blomefield),\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" II. page 34.) a passage in which the writer\r\ndescribes the deep impression made on his mind by certain groups of\r\nfacts observed in South America. Mr. Huxley goes on: \"The facts to which\r\nreference is here made were, without doubt, eminently fitted to attract\r\nthe attention of a philosophical thinker; but, until the relations\r\nof the existing with the extinct species, and of the species of the\r\ndifferent geographical areas with one another, were determined with some\r\nexactness, they afforded but an unsafe foundation for speculation.\r\nIt was not possible that this determination should have been effected\r\nbefore the return of the \"Beagle\" to England; and thus the date\r\n(Chapter II./4. The date in question is July 1837, when he \"opened first\r\nnote-book on Transmutation of Species.') which Darwin (writing in 1837)\r\nassigns to the dawn of the new light which was rising in his mind,\r\nbecomes intelligible.\" This seems to us inconsistent with Darwin's\r\nown statement that it was especially the character of the \"species on\r\nGalapagos Archipelago\" which had impressed him. (Chapter II./5. See\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" I., page 276.) This must refer to the zoological\r\nspecimens: no doubt he was thinking of the birds, but these he had\r\nhimself collected in 1835 (Chapter II./6. He wrote in his \"Journal,\"\r\npage 394, \"My attention was first thoroughly aroused, by comparing\r\ntogether the numerous specimens shot by myself and several other\r\nparties on board,\" etc.), and no accurate determination of the forms was\r\nnecessary to impress on him the remarkable characteristic species of the\r\ndifferent islands. We agree with Mr. Huxley that 1837 is the date of\r\nthe \"new light which was rising in his mind.\" That the dawn did not come\r\nsooner seems to us to be accounted for by the need of time to produce so\r\ngreat a revolution in his conceptions. We do not see that Mr. Huxley's\r\nsupposition as to the effect of the determination of species, etc., has\r\nmuch weight. Mr. Huxley quotes a letter from Darwin to Zacharias, \"But\r\nI did not become convinced that species were mutable until, I think, two\r\nor three years [after 1837] had elapsed\" (see Letter 278). This\r\npassage, which it must be remembered was written in 1877, is all but\r\nirreconcilable with the direct evidence of the 1837 note-book. A series\r\nof passages are quoted from it in the \"Life and Letters,\" Volume II.,\r\npages 5 et seq., and these it is impossible to read without feeling that\r\nhe was convinced of immutability. He had not yet attained to a clear\r\nidea of Natural Selection, and therefore his views may not have had,\r\neven to himself, the irresistible convincing power they afterwards\r\ngained; but that he was, in the ordinary sense of the word, convinced\r\nof the truth of the doctrine of evolution we cannot doubt. He thought it\r\n\"almost useless\" to try to prove the truth of evolution until the cause\r\nof change was discovered. And it is natural that in later life he should\r\nhave felt that conviction was wanting till that cause was made out.\r\n(Chapter II./7. See \"Charles Darwin, his Life told, etc.\" 1892, page\r\n165.) For the purposes of the present chapter the point is not very\r\nmaterial. We know that in 1842 he wrote the first sketch of his theory,\r\nand that it was greatly amplified in 1844. So that, at the date of the\r\nfirst letters of this chapter, we know that he had a working hypothesis\r\nof evolution which did not differ in essentials from that given in the\r\n\"Origin of Species.\"\r\n\r\nTo realise the amount of work that was in progress during the period\r\ncovered by Chapter II., it should be remembered that during part of the\r\ntime--namely, from 1846 to 1854--he was largely occupied by his work on\r\nthe Cirripedes. (Chapter II./8. \"Life and Letters,\" I. page 346.) This\r\nresearch would have fully occupied a less methodical workman, and even\r\nto those who saw him at work it seemed his whole occupation. Thus (to\r\nquote a story of Lord Avebury's) one of Mr. Darwin's children is said\r\nto have asked, in regard to a neighbour, \"Then where does he do his\r\nbarnacles?\" as though not merely his father, but all other men, must be\r\noccupied on that group.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Hooker, to whom the first letter in this chapter is\r\naddressed, was good enough to supply a note on the origin of his\r\nintimacy with Mr. Darwin, and this is published in the \"Life and\r\nLetters.\" (Chapter II./9. Ibid., II., page 19. See also \"Nature,\" 1899,\r\nJune 22nd, page 187, where some reminiscences are published, which\r\nformed part of Sir Joseph's speech at the unveiling of Darwin's statue\r\nin the Oxford Museum.) The close intercourse that sprang up between them\r\nwas largely carried on by correspondence, and Mr. Darwin's letters to\r\nSir Joseph have supplied most valuable biographical material. But it\r\nshould not be forgotten that, quite apart from this, science owes much\r\nto this memorable friendship, since without Hooker's aid Darwin's great\r\nwork would hardly have been carried out on the botanical side. And Sir\r\nJoseph did far more than supply knowledge and guidance in technical\r\nmatters: Darwin owed to him a sympathetic and inspiriting comradeship\r\nwhich cheered and refreshed him to the end of his life.\r\n\r\nA sentence from a letter to Hooker written in 1845 shows, quite as\r\nwell as more serious utterances, how quickly the acquaintance grew into\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell! What a good thing is community of tastes! I feel as if I had\r\nknown you for fifty years. Adios.\" And in illustration of the permanence\r\nof the sympathetic bond between them, we quote a letter of 1881 written\r\nforty-two years after the first meeting with Sir Joseph in Trafalgar\r\nSquare (see \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 19). Mr. Darwin wrote: \"Your\r\nletter has cheered me, and the world does not look a quarter so black\r\nthis morning as it did when I wrote before. Your friendly words are\r\nworth their weight in gold.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 13. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Thursday [January 11th, 1844].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir\r\n\r\nI must write to thank you for your last letter, and to tell you how much\r\nall your views and facts interest me. I must be allowed to put my own\r\ninterpretation on what you say of \"not being a good arranger of extended\r\nviews\"--which is, that you do not indulge in the loose speculations so\r\neasily started by every smatterer and wandering collector. I look at a\r\nstrong tendency to generalise as an entire evil.\r\n\r\nWhat you say of Mr. Brown is humiliating; I had suspected it, but would\r\nnot allow myself to believe in such heresy. Fitz-Roy gave him a rap\r\nin his preface (13/1. In the preface to the \"Surveying Voyages of the\r\n'Adventure' and the 'Beagle,' 1826-30, forming Volume I of the work,\r\nwhich includes the later voyage of the \"Beagle,\" Captain Fitz-Roy wrote\r\n(March, 1839): \"Captain King took great pains in forming and preserving\r\na botanical collection, aided by a person embarked solely for that\r\npurpose. He placed this collection in the British Museum, and was led to\r\nexpect that a first-rate botanist would have examined and described\r\nit; but he has been disappointed.\" A reference to Robert Brown's\r\ndilatoriness over King's collection occurs in the \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nI., page 274, note.), and made him very indignant, but it seems a much\r\nharder one would not have been wasted. My cryptogamic collection\r\nwas sent to Berkeley; it was not large. I do not believe he has yet\r\npublished an account, but he wrote to me some year ago that he had\r\ndescribed [the specimens] and mislaid all his descriptions. Would it not\r\nbe well for you to put yourself in communication with him, as otherwise\r\nsomething will perhaps be twice laboured over? My best (though poor)\r\ncollection of the cryptogams was from the Chonos Islands.\r\n\r\nWould you kindly observe one little fact for me, whether any species of\r\nplant, peculiar to any island, as Galapagos, St. Helena, or New Zealand,\r\nwhere there are no large quadrupeds, have hooked seeds--such hooks as,\r\nif observed here, would be thought with justness to be adapted to catch\r\ninto wool of animals.\r\n\r\nWould you further oblige me some time by informing me (though I forget\r\nthis will certainly appear in your \"Antarctic Flora\") whether in islands\r\nlike St. Helena, Galapagos, and New Zealand, the number of families\r\nand genera are large compared with the number of species, as happens in\r\ncoral islands, and as, I believe, in the extreme Arctic land. Certainly\r\nthis is the case with marine shells in extreme Arctic seas. Do you\r\nsuppose the fewness of species in proportion to number of large groups\r\nin coral islets is owing to the chance of seeds from all orders\r\ngetting drifted to such new spots, as I have supposed. Did you collect\r\nsea-shells in Kerguelen-land? I should like to know their character.\r\n\r\nYour interesting letters tempt me to be very unreasonable in asking you\r\nquestions; but you must not give yourself any trouble about them, for\r\nI know how fully and worthily you are employed. (13/2. The rest of the\r\nletter has been previously published in \"Life and Letters,\" II., page\r\n23.)\r\n\r\nBesides a general interest about the southern lands, I have been now\r\never since my return engaged in a very presumptuous work, and I know\r\nno one individual who would not say a very foolish one. I was so struck\r\nwith the distribution of the Galapagos organisms, etc., and with the\r\ncharacter of the American fossil mammifers, etc., that I determined to\r\ncollect blindly every sort of fact which could bear any way on what are\r\nspecies. I have read heaps of agricultural and horticultural books, and\r\nhave never ceased collecting facts. At last gleams of light have come,\r\nand I am almost convinced (quite contrary to the opinion I started with)\r\nthat species are not (it is like confessing a murder) immutable.\r\nHeaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of a \"tendency to progression,\"\r\n\"adaptations from the slow willing of animals,\" etc.! But the\r\nconclusions I am led to are not widely different from his; though\r\nthe means of change are wholly so. I think I have found out (here's\r\npresumption!) the simple way by which species become exquisitely adapted\r\nto various ends. You will now groan, and think to yourself, \"on what a\r\nman have I been wasting my time and writing to.\" I should, five years\r\nago, have thought so...(13/3. On the questions here dealt with see the\r\ninteresting letter to Jenyns in the \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 34.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 14. TO J.D. HOOKER. [November] 1844.\r\n\r\n...What a curious, wonderful case is that of the Lycopodium! (14/1. Sir\r\nJ.D. Hooker wrote, November 8, 1844: \"I am firmly convinced (but not\r\nenough to print it) that L. Selago varies in Van Diemen's Land into L.\r\nvarium. Two more different SPECIES (as they have hitherto been thought),\r\nper se cannot be conceived, but nowhere else do they vary into one\r\nanother, nor does Selago vary at all in England.\")...I suppose you would\r\nhardly have expected them to be more varying than a phanerogamic plant.\r\nI trust you will work the case out, and, even if unsupported, publish\r\nit, for you can surely do this with due caution. I have heard of some\r\nanalogous facts, though on the smallest scale, in certain insects being\r\nmore variable in one district than in another, and I think the same\r\nholds with some land-shells. By a strange chance I had noted to ask you\r\nin this letter an analogous question, with respect to genera, in lieu\r\nof individual species,--that is, whether you know of any case of a genus\r\nwith most of its species being variable (say Rubus) in one continent,\r\nhaving another set of species in another continent non-variable, or not\r\nin so marked a manner. Mr. Herbert (14/2. No doubt Dean Herbert, the\r\nhorticulturist. See \"Life and Letters,\" I., page 343.) incidentally\r\nmentioned in a letter to me that the heaths at the Cape of Good Hope\r\nwere very variable, whilst in Europe they are (?) not so; but then the\r\nspecies here are few in comparison, so that the case, even if true, is\r\nnot a good one. In some genera of insects the variability appears to be\r\ncommon in distant parts of the world. In shells, I hope hereafter to\r\nget much light on this question through fossils. If you can help me, I\r\nshould be very much obliged: indeed, all your letters are most useful to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nMONDAY:--Now for your first long letter, and to me quite as interesting\r\nas long. Several things are quite new to me in it--viz., for one, your\r\nbelief that there are more extra-tropical than intra-tropical species. I\r\nsee that my argument from the Arctic regions is false, and I should not\r\nhave tried to argue against you, had I not fancied that you thought that\r\nequability of climate was the direct cause of the creation of a greater\r\nor lesser number of species. I see you call our climate equable; I\r\nshould have thought it was the contrary. Anyhow, the term is vague, and\r\nin England will depend upon whether a person compares it with the United\r\nStates or Tierra del Fuego. In my Journal (page 342) I see I state that\r\nin South Chiloe, at a height of about 1,000 feet, the forests had a\r\nFuegian aspect: I distinctly recollect that at the sea-level in the\r\nmiddle of Chiloe the forest had almost a tropical aspect. I should like\r\nmuch to hear, if you make out, whether the N. or S. boundaries of a\r\nplant are the most restricted; I should have expected that the S. would\r\nbe, in the temperate regions, from the number of antagonist species\r\nbeing greater. N.B. Humboldt, when in London, told me of some river\r\n(14/3. The Obi (see \"Flora Antarctica,\" page 211, note). Hooker writes:\r\n\"Some of the most conspicuous trees attain either of its banks, but do\r\nnot cross them.\") in N.E. Europe, on the opposite banks of which the\r\nflora was, on the same soil and under same climate, widely different!\r\n\r\nI forget (14/4. The last paragraph is published in \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nII., page 29.) my last letter, but it must have been a very silly one,\r\nas it seems I gave my notion of the number of species being in great\r\ndegree governed by the degree to which the area had been often isolated\r\nand divided. I must have been cracked to have written it, for I have no\r\nevidence, without a person be willing to admit all my views, and then it\r\ndoes follow.\r\n\r\n(14/5. The remainder of the foregoing letter is published in the \"Life\r\nand Letters,\" II., page 29. It is interesting as giving his views on\r\nthe mutability of species. Thus he wrote: \"With respect to books on this\r\nsubject, I do not know any systematical ones, except Lamarck's, which is\r\nveritable rubbish; but there are plenty, as Lyell, Pritchard, etc., on\r\nthe view of the immutability.\" By \"Pritchard\" is no doubt intended James\r\nCowles \"Prichard,\" author of the \"Physical History of Mankind.\" Prof.\r\nPoulton has given in his paper, \"A remarkable Anticipation of Modern\r\nViews on Evolution\" (14/6. \"Science Progress,\" Volume I., April 1897,\r\npage 278.), an interesting study of Prichard's work. He shows that\r\nPrichard was in advance of his day in his views on the non-transmission\r\nof acquired characters. Prof. Poulton also tries to show that Prichard\r\nwas an evolutionist. He allows that Prichard wrote with hesitation, and\r\nthat in the later editions of his book his views became weaker.\r\nBut, even with these qualifications, we think that Poulton has\r\nunintentionally exaggerated the degree to which Prichard believed in\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nOne of Prichard's strongest sentences is quoted by Poulton (loc. cit.,\r\npage 16); it occurs in the \"Physical History of Mankind,\" Ed. 2, Volume\r\nII., page 570:--\r\n\r\n\"Is it not probable that the varieties which spring up within the\r\nlimits of particular species are further adaptations of structure to\r\nthe circumstances under which the tribe is destined to exist? Varieties\r\nbranch out from the common form of a species, just as the forms of\r\nspecies deviate from the common type of a genus. Why should the\r\none class of phenomena be without end or utility, a mere effect of\r\ncontingency or chance, more than the other?\"\r\n\r\nIf this passage, and others similar to it, stood alone, we might agree\r\nwith Prof. Poulton; but this is impossible when we find in Volume I.\r\nof the same edition, page 90, the following uncompromising statement of\r\nimmutability:--\r\n\r\n\"The meaning attached to the term species, in natural history, is\r\nvery simple and obvious. It includes only one circumstance--namely, an\r\noriginal distinctness and constant transmission of any character. A race\r\nof animals, or plants, marked by any peculiarities of structure which\r\nhave always been constant and undeviating, constitutes a species.\"\r\n\r\nOn page 91, in speaking of the idea that the species which make up a\r\ngenus may have descended from a common form, he says:--\r\n\r\n\"There must, indeed, be some principle on which the phenomena of\r\nresemblance, as well as those of diversity, may be explained; and the\r\nreference of several forms to a common type seems calculated to suggest\r\nthe idea of some original affinity; but, as this is merely a conjecture,\r\nit must be kept out of sight when our inquiries respect matters of fact\r\nonly.\"\r\n\r\nThis view is again given in Volume II., page 569, where he asks whether\r\nwe should believe that \"at the first production of a genus, when it\r\nfirst grew into existence, some slight modification in the productive\r\ncauses stamped it originally with all these specific diversities? Or is\r\nit most probable that the modification was subsequent to its origin, and\r\nthat the genus at its first creation was one and uniform, and afterwards\r\nbecame diversified by the influence of external agents?\" He concludes\r\nthat \"the former of these suppositions is the conclusion to which we are\r\nled by all that can be ascertained respecting the limits of species,\r\nand the extent of variation under the influence of causes at present\r\nexisting and operating.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that Prichard did not carry his ideas to their\r\nlogical conclusion, it may perhaps excite surprise that Mr. Darwin\r\nshould have spoken of him as absolutely on the side of immutability.\r\n\r\nWe believe it to be partly accounted for (as Poulton suggests) by the\r\nfact that Mr. Darwin possessed only the third edition (1836 and 1837)\r\nand the fourth edition (1841-51). (14/7. The edition of 1841-51 consists\r\nof reprints of the third edition and three additional volumes of various\r\ndates. Volumes I. and II. are described in the title-page as the fourth\r\nedition; Volumes III. and IV. as the third edition, and Volume V. has\r\nno edition marked in the title.) In neither of these is the evolutionary\r\npoint of view so strong as in the second edition.\r\n\r\nWe have gone through all the passages marked by Mr. Darwin for future\r\nreference in the third and fourth editions, and have been only able to\r\nfind the following, which occurs in the third edition (Volume I., 1836,\r\npage 242) (14/8. There is also (ed. 1837, Volume II., page 344) a vague\r\nreference to Natural Selection, of which the last sentence is enclosed\r\nin pencil in inverted commas, as though Mr. Darwin had intended to\r\nquote it: \"In other parts of Africa the xanthous variety [of man] often\r\nappears, but does not multiply. Individuals thus characterised are like\r\nseeds which perish in an uncongenial soil.\")\r\n\r\n\"The variety in form, prevalent among all organised productions of\r\nnature, is found to subsist between individual beings of whatever\r\nspecies, even when they are offspring of the same parents. Another\r\ncircumstance equally remarkable is the tendency which exists in almost\r\nevery tribe, whether of animals or of plants, to transmit to their\r\noffspring and to perpetuate in their race all individual peculiarities\r\nwhich may thus have taken their rise. These two general facts in the\r\neconomy of organised beings lay a foundation for the existence of\r\ndiversified races, originating from the same primitive stock and within\r\nthe limits of identical species.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following page (page 243) a passage (not marked by Mr. Darwin)\r\nemphasises the limitation which Prichard ascribed to the results of\r\nvariation and inheritance:--\r\n\r\n\"Even those physiologists who contend for what is termed the indefinite\r\nnature of species admit that they have limits at present and under\r\nordinary circumstances. Whatever diversities take place happen without\r\nbreaking in upon the characteristic type of the species. This is\r\ntransmitted from generation to generation: goats produce goats, and\r\nsheep, sheep.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage on page 242 occurs in the reprint of the 1836-7 edition\r\nwhich forms part of the 1841-51 edition, but is not there marked by Mr.\r\nDarwin. He notes at the end of Volume I. of the 1836-7 edition: \"March,\r\n1857. I have not looked through all these [i.e. marked passages], but I\r\nhave gone through the later edition\"; and a similar entry is in Volume\r\nII. of the third edition. It is therefore easy to understand how he came\r\nto overlook the passage on page 242 when he began the fuller statement\r\nof his species theory which is referred to in the \"Life and Letters\" as\r\nthe \"unfinished book.\" In the historical sketch prefixed to the \"Origin\r\nof Species\" writers are named as precursors whose claims are less strong\r\nthan Prichard's, and it is certain that Mr. Darwin would have given an\r\naccount of him if he had thought of him as an evolutionist.\r\n\r\nThe two following passages will show that Mr. Darwin was, from his\r\nknowledge of Prichard's books, justified in classing him among those who\r\ndid not believe in the mutability of species:\r\n\r\n\"The various tribes of organised beings were originally placed by\r\nthe Creator in certain regions, for which they are by their nature\r\npeculiarly adapted. Each species had only one beginning in a single\r\nstock: probably a single pair, as Linnaeus supposed, was first called\r\ninto being in some particular spot, and the progeny left to disperse\r\nthemselves to as great a distance from the original centre of their\r\nexistence as the locomotive powers bestowed on them, or their capability\r\nof bearing changes of climate and other physical agencies, may have\r\nenabled them to wander.\" (14/9. Prichard, third edition, 1836-7, Volume\r\nI., page 96.)\r\n\r\nThe second passage is annotated by Mr. Darwin with a shower of\r\nexclamation marks:\r\n\r\n\"The meaning attached to the term SPECIES in natural history is\r\nvery definite and intelligible. It includes only the following\r\nconditions--namely, separate origin and distinctness of race, evinced\r\nby the constant transmission of some characteristic peculiarity of\r\norganisation. A race of animals or of plants marked by any peculiar\r\ncharacter which has always been constant and undeviating constitutes a\r\nspecies; and two races are considered as specifically different, if\r\nthey are distinguished from each other by some characteristic which one\r\ncannot be supposed to have acquired, or the other to have lost through\r\nany known operation of physical causes; for we are hence led to conclude\r\nthat the tribes thus distinguished have not descended from the same\r\noriginal stock.\" (14/10. Prichard, ed. 1836-7, Volume I., page 106. This\r\npassage is almost identical with that quoted from the second edition,\r\nVolume I., page 90. The latter part, from \"and two races...,\" occurs in\r\nthe second edition, though not quoted above.)\r\n\r\nAs was his custom, Mr. Darwin pinned at the end of the first volume\r\nof the 1841-51 edition a piece of paper containing a list of the pages\r\nwhere marked passages occur. This paper bears, written in pencil, \"How\r\nlike my book all this will be!\" The words appear to refer to Prichard's\r\ndiscussion on the dispersal of animals and plants; they certainly do not\r\nrefer to the evolutionary views to be found in the book.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 15. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1844].\r\n\r\nThank you exceedingly for your long letter, and I am in truth ashamed\r\nof the time and trouble you have taken for me; but I must some day write\r\nagain to you on the subject of your letter. I will only now observe that\r\nyou have extended my remark on the range of species of shells into the\r\nrange of genera or groups. Analogy from shells would only go so far,\r\nthat if two or three species...were found to range from America to\r\nIndia, they would be found to extend through an unusual thickness\r\nof strata--say from the Upper Cretaceous to its lowest bed, or the\r\nNeocomian. Or you may reverse it and say those species which range\r\nthroughout the whole Cretaceous, will have wide ranges: viz., from\r\nAmerica through Europe to India (this is one actual case with shells in\r\nthe Cretaceous period).\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 16. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1845].\r\n\r\nI ought to have written sooner to say that I am very willing to\r\nsubscribe 1 pound 1 shilling to the African man (though it be murder on\r\na small scale), and will send you a Post-office-order payable to Kew, if\r\nyou will be so good as to take charge of it. Thanks for your information\r\nabout the Antarctic Zoology; I got my numbers when in Town on Thursday:\r\nwould it be asking your publisher to take too much trouble to send your\r\nBotany [\"Flora Antarctica,\" by J.D. Hooker, 1844] to the Athenaeum Club?\r\nhe might send two or three numbers together. I am really ashamed to\r\nthink of your having given me such a valuable work; all I can say is\r\nthat I appreciate your present in two ways--as your gift, and for its\r\ngreat use to my species-work. I am very glad to hear that you mean to\r\nattack this subject some day. I wonder whether we shall ever be public\r\ncombatants; anyhow, I congratulate myself in a most unfair advantage of\r\nyou, viz., in having extracted more facts and views from you than from\r\nany one other person. I daresay your explanation of polymorphism on\r\nvolcanic islands may be the right one; the reason I am curious about it\r\nis, the fact of the birds on the Galapagos being in several instances\r\nvery fine-run species--that is, in comparing them, not so much one with\r\nanother, as with their analogues from the continent. I have somehow\r\nfelt, like you, that an alpine form of a plant is not a true variety;\r\nand yet I cannot admit that the simple fact of the cause being\r\nassignable ought to prevent its being called a variety; every variation\r\nmust have some cause, so that the difference would rest on our knowledge\r\nin being able or not to assign the cause. Do you consider that a true\r\nvariety should be produced by causes acting through the parent? But even\r\ntaking this definition, are you sure that alpine forms are not inherited\r\nfrom one, two, or three generations? Now, would not this be a curious\r\nand valuable experiment (16/1. For an account of work of this character,\r\nsee papers by G. Bonnier in the \"Revue Generale,\" Volume II., 1890;\r\n\"Ann. Sc. Nat.\" Volume XX.; \"Revue Generale,\" Volume VII.), viz., to get\r\nseeds of some alpine plant, a little more hairy, etc., etc., than its\r\nlowland fellow, and raise seedlings at Kew: if this has not been done,\r\ncould you not get it done? Have you anybody in Scotland from whom you\r\ncould get the seeds?\r\n\r\nI have been interested by your remarks on Senecia and Gnaphalium: would\r\nit not be worth while (I should be very curious to hear the result) to\r\nmake a short list of the generally considered variable or polymorphous\r\ngenera, as Rosa, Salix, Rubus, etc., etc., and reflect whether such\r\ngenera are generally mundane, and more especially whether they have\r\ndistinct or identical (or closely allied) species in their different and\r\ndistant habitats.\r\n\r\nDon't forget me, if you ever stumble on cases of the same species being\r\nMORE or LESS variable in different countries.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the word \"sterile\" as used for male or polleniferous\r\nflowers, it has always offended my ears dreadfully; on the same\r\nprinciple that it would to hear a potent stallion, ram or bull called\r\nsterile, because they did not bear, as well as beget, young.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your geological-map suggestion, I wish with all my\r\nheart I could follow it; but just reflect on the number of measurements\r\nrequisite; why, at present it could not be done even in England, even\r\nwith the assumption of the land having simply risen any exact number of\r\nfeet. But subsidence in most cases has hopelessly complexed the problem:\r\nsee what Jordanhill-Smith (16/2. James Smith, of Jordan Hill, author of\r\na paper \"On the Geology of Gibraltar\" (\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume\r\nII., page 41, 1846).) says of the dance up and down, many times, which\r\nGibraltar has had all within the recent period. Such maps as Lyell\r\n(16/3. \"Principles of Geology,\" 1875, Volume I., Plate I, page 254.) has\r\npublished of sea and land at the beginning of the Tertiary period must\r\nbe excessively inaccurate: it assumes that every part on which Tertiary\r\nbeds have not been deposited, must have then been dry land,--a most\r\ndoubtful assumption.\r\n\r\nI have been amused by Chambers v. Hooker on the K. Cabbage. I see in\r\nthe \"Explanations\" (the spirit of which, though not the facts, ought to\r\nshame Sedgwick) that \"Vestiges\" considers all land-animals and plants to\r\nhave passed from marine forms; so Chambers is quite in accordance. Did\r\nyou hear Forbes, when here, giving the rather curious evidence (from a\r\nsimilarity in error) that Chambers must be the author of the\r\n\"Vestiges\": your case strikes me as some confirmation. I have written an\r\nunreasonably long and dull letter, so farewell. (16/4. \"Explanations: A\r\nSequel to the Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\" was published\r\nin 1845, after the appearance of the fourth edition of the \"Vestiges,\"\r\nby way of reply to the criticisms on the original book. The \"K.\r\ncabbage\" referred to at the beginning of the paragraph is Pringlea\r\nantiscorbutica,\" the \"Kerguelen Cabbage\" described by Sir J.D. Hooker in\r\nhis \"Flora Antarctica.\" What Chambers wrote on this subject we have not\r\ndiscovered. The mention of Sedgwick is a reference to his severe review\r\nof the \"Vestiges\" in the \"Edinburgh Review,\" 1845, volume 82, page 1.\r\nDarwin described it as savouring \"of the dogmatism of the pulpit\" (\"Life\r\nand Letters,\" I., page 344). Mr. Ireland's edition of the \"Vestiges\"\r\n(1844), in which Robert Chambers was first authentically announced as\r\nthe author, contains (page xxix) an extract from a letter written by\r\nChambers in 1860, in which the following passage occurs, \"The April\r\nnumber of the 'Edinburgh Review\"' (1860) makes all but a direct amende\r\nfor the abuse it poured upon my work a number of years ago.\" This is the\r\nwell-known review by Owen, to which references occur in the \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" II., page 300. The amende to the \"Vestiges\" is not so full\r\nas the author felt it to be; but it was clearly in place in a paper\r\nintended to belittle the \"Origin\"; it also gave the reviewer (page 511)\r\nan opportunity for a hit at Sedgwick and his 1845 review.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 17. TO L. BLOMEFIELD [JENYNS]. Down. February 14th [1845].\r\n\r\nI have taken my leisure in thanking you for your last letter and\r\ndiscussion, to me very interesting, on the increase of species. Since\r\nyour letter, I have met with a very similar view in Richardson, who\r\nstates that the young are driven away by the old into unfavourable\r\ndistricts, and there mostly perish. When one meets with such unexpected\r\nstatistical returns on the increase and decrease and proportion of\r\ndeaths and births amongst mankind, and in this well-known country of\r\nours, one ought not to be in the least surprised at one's ignorance,\r\nwhen, where, and how the endless increase of our robins and sparrows is\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\nThanks for your hints about terms of \"mutation,\" etc.; I had some\r\nsuspicions that it was not quite correct, and yet I do not see my way to\r\narrive at any better terms. It will be years before I publish, so that\r\nI shall have plenty of time to think of better words. Development would\r\nperhaps do, only it is applied to the changes of an individual during\r\nits growth. I am, however, very glad of your remark, and will ponder\r\nover it.\r\n\r\nWe are all well, wife and children three, and as flourishing as this\r\nhorrid, house-confining, tempestuous weather permits.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 18. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1845].\r\n\r\nI hope you are getting on well with your lectures, and that you have\r\nenjoyed some pleasant walks during the late delightful weather. I write\r\nto tell you (as perhaps you might have had fears on the subject) that\r\nyour books have arrived safely. I am exceedingly obliged to you for\r\nthem, and will take great care of them; they will take me some time to\r\nread carefully.\r\n\r\nI send to-day the corrected MS. of the first number of my \"Journal\"\r\n(18/1. In 1842 he had written to his sister: \"Talking of money, I reaped\r\nthe other day all the profit which I shall ever get from my \"Journal\"\r\n[\"Journal of Researches, etc.\"] which consisted in paying Mr. Colburn\r\n21 pounds 10 shillings for the copies which I presented to different\r\npeople; 1,337 copies have been sold. This is a comfortable arrangement,\r\nis it not?\" He was proved wrong in his gloomy prophecy, as the second\r\nedition was published by Mr. Murray in 1845.) in the Colonial Library,\r\nso that if you chance to know of any gross mistake in the first 214\r\npages (if you have my \"Journal\"), I should be obliged to you to tell me.\r\n\r\nDo not answer this for form's sake; for you must be very busy. We have\r\njust had the Lyells here, and you ought to have a wife to stop your\r\nworking too much, as Mrs. Lyell peremptorily stops Lyell.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 19. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(19/1. Sir J.D. Hooker's letters to Mr. Darwin seem to fix the date as\r\n1845, while the reference to Forbes' paper indicates 1846.)\r\n\r\nDown [1845-1846].\r\n\r\nI am particularly obliged for your facts about solitary islands having\r\nseveral species of peculiar genera; it knocks on the head some analogies\r\nof mine; the point stupidly never occurred to me to ask about. I am\r\namused at your anathemas against variation and co.; whatever you may be\r\npleased to say, you will never be content with simple species, \"as they\r\nare.\" I defy you to steel your mind to technicalities, like so many of\r\nour brother naturalists. I am much pleased that I thought of sending\r\nyou Forbes' article. (19/2. E. Forbes' celebrated paper \"Memoirs of\r\nthe Geological Survey of Great Britain,\" Volume I., page 336, 1846. In\r\nLyell's \"Principles,\" 7th Edition, 1847, page 676, he makes a temperate\r\nclaim of priority, as he had already done in a private letter of October\r\n14th, 1846, to Forbes (\"Life of Sir Charles Lyell,\" 1881, Volume II.,\r\npage 106) both as regards the Sicilian flora and the barrier effect of\r\nmountain-chains. See Letter 20 for a note on Forbes.) I confess I cannot\r\nmake out the evidence of his time-notions in distribution, and I cannot\r\nhelp suspecting that they are rather vague. Lyell preceded Forbes in one\r\nclass of speculation of this kind: for instance, in his explaining the\r\nidentity of the Sicily Flora with that of South Italy, by its having\r\nbeen wholly upraised within the recent period; and, so I believe, with\r\nmountain-chains separating floras. I do not remember Humboldt's fact\r\nabout the heath regions. Very curious the case of the broom; I can tell\r\nyou something analogous on a small scale. My father, when he built his\r\nhouse, sowed many broom-seeds on a wild bank, which did not come up,\r\nowing, as it was thought, to much earth having been thrown over them.\r\nAbout thirty-five years afterwards, in cutting a terrace, all this earth\r\nwas thrown up, and now the bank is one mass of broom. I see we were\r\nin some degree talking to cross-purposes; when I said I did [not] much\r\nbelieve in hybridising to any extent, I did not mean at all to exclude\r\ncrossing. It has long been a hobby of mine to see in how many flowers\r\nsuch crossing is probable; it was, I believe, Knight's view, originally,\r\nthat every plant must be occasionally crossed. (19/3. See an article\r\non \"The Knight-Darwin law\" by Francis Darwin in \"Nature,\" October 27th,\r\n1898, page 630.) I find, however, plenty of difficulty in showing even\r\na vague probability of this; especially in the Leguminosae, though their\r\n[structure?] is inimitably adapted to favour crossing, I have never\r\nyet met with but one instance of a NATURAL MONGREL (nor mule?) in this\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nI shall be particularly curious to hear some account of the appearance\r\nand origin of the Ayrshire Irish Yew. And now for the main object of my\r\nletter: it is to ask whether you would just run your eye over the\r\nproof of my Galapagos chapter (19/4. In the second edition of the\r\n\"Naturalist's Voyage.\"), where I mention the plants, to see that I have\r\nmade no blunders, or spelt any of the scientific names wrongly. As\r\nI daresay you will so far oblige me, will you let me know a few days\r\nbefore, when you leave Edinburgh and how long you stay at Kinnordy, so\r\nthat my letter might catch you. I am not surprised at my collection from\r\nJames Island differing from others, as the damp upland district (where I\r\nslept two nights) is six miles from the coast, and no naturalist except\r\nmyself probably ever ascended to it. Cuming had never even heard of it.\r\nCuming tells me that he was on Charles, James, and Albemarle Islands,\r\nand that he cannot remember from my description the Scalesia, but thinks\r\nhe could if he saw a specimen. I have no idea of the origin of the\r\ndistribution of the Galapagos shells, about which you ask. I\r\npresume (after Forbes' excellent remarks on the facilities by which\r\nembryo-shells are transported) that the Pacific shells have been borne\r\nthither by currents; but the currents all run the other way.\r\n\r\n\r\n(PLATE: EDWARD FORBES 1844? From a photograph by Hill & Adamson.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 20. EDWARD FORBES TO C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(20/1. Edward Forbes was at work on his celebrated paper in the\r\n\"Geological Survey Memoirs\" for 1846. We have not seen the letter of\r\nDarwin's to which this is a reply, nor, indeed, any of his letters to\r\nForbes. The date of the letter is fixed by Forbes's lecture given at\r\nthe Royal Institution on February 27th, 1846 (according to L. Horner's\r\nprivately printed \"Memoirs,\" II., page 94.))\r\n\r\nWednesday. 3, Southwark Street, Hyde Park. [1846].\r\n\r\nDear Darwin\r\n\r\nTo answer your very welcome letter, so far from being a waste of time,\r\nis a gain, for it obliges me to make myself clear and understood\r\non matters which I have evidently put forward imperfectly and with\r\nobscurity. I have devoted the whole of this week to working and writing\r\nout the flora question, for I now feel strong enough to give my promised\r\nevening lecture on it at the Royal Institution on Friday, and, moreover,\r\nwish to get it in printable form for the Reports of our Survey.\r\nTherefore at no time can I receive or answer objections with more\r\nbenefit than now. From the hurry and pressure which unfortunately attend\r\nall my movements and doings I rarely have time to spare, in preparing\r\nfor publication, to do more than give brief and unsatisfactory\r\nabstracts, which I fear are often extremely obscure.\r\n\r\nNow for your objections--which have sprung out of my own obscurities.\r\n\r\nI do not argue in a circle about the Irish case, but treat the botanical\r\nevidence of connection and the geological as distinct. The former only I\r\nurged at Cambridge; the latter I have not yet publicly maintained.\r\n\r\nMy Cambridge argument (20/2. \"On the Distribution of Endemic Plants,\"\r\nby E. Forbes, \"Brit. Assoc. Rep.\" 1845 (Cambridge), page 67.) was this:\r\nThat no known currents, whether of water or air, or ordinary means of\r\ntransport (20/3. Darwin's note on transportation (found with Forbes'\r\nletter): \"Forbes' arguments, from several Spanish plants in Ireland not\r\nbeing transported, not sound, because sea-currents and air ditto and\r\nmigration of birds in SAME LINES. I have thought not-transportation\r\nthe greatest difficulty. Now we see how many seeds every plant and tree\r\nrequires to be regularly propagated in its own country, for we cannot\r\nthink the great number of seeds superfluous, and therefore how small is\r\nthe chance of here and there a solitary seedling being preserved in a\r\nwell-stocked country.\"), would account for the little group of Asturian\r\nplants--few as to species, but playing a conspicuous part in the\r\nvegetation--giving a peculiar botanical character to the south of\r\nIreland; that, as I had produced evidence of the other floras of our\r\nislands, i.e. the Germanic, the Cretaceous, and the Devonian (these\r\nterms used topographically, not geologically) having been acquired by\r\nmigration over continuous land (the glacial or alpine flora I except\r\nfor the present--as ice-carriage might have played a great part in its\r\nintroduction)--I considered it most probable, and maintained, that the\r\nintroduction of that Irish flora was also effected by the same means.\r\nI held also that the character of this flora was more southern and more\r\nancient than that of any of the others, and that its fragmentary and\r\nlimited state was probably due to the plants composing it having (from\r\ntheir comparative hardiness--heaths, saxifrages, etc.) survived the\r\ndestroying influence of the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nMy geological argument now is as follows: half the Mediterranean\r\nislands, or more, are partly--in some cases (as Malta) wholly--composed\r\nof the upheaved bed of the Miocene sea; so is a great part of the south\r\nof France from Bordeaux to Montpellier; so is the west of Portugal; and\r\nwe find the corresponding beds with the same fossils (Pecten latissimus,\r\netc.) in the Azores. So general an upheaval seems to me to indicate the\r\nformer existence of a great post-Miocene land [in] the region of what\r\nis usually called the Mediterranean flora. (Everywhere these Miocene\r\nislands, etc., bear a flora of true type.) If this land existed, it did\r\nnot extend to America, for the fossils of the Miocene of America\r\nare representative and not identical. Where, then, was the edge or\r\ncoast-line of it, Atlantic-wards? Look at the form and constancy of the\r\ngreat fucus-bank, and consider that it is a Sargassum bank, and that\r\nthe Sargassum there is in an abnormal condition, and that the species\r\nof this genus of fuci are essentially ground-growers, and then see the\r\nprobability of this bank having originated on a line of ancient coast.\r\n\r\nNow, having thus argued independently, first on my flora and second on\r\nthe geological evidences of land in the quarter required, I put the two\r\ntogether to bear up my Irish case.\r\n\r\nI cannot admit the Sargassum case to be parallel with that of Confervae\r\nor Oscillatoria.\r\n\r\nI think I have evidence from the fossils of the boulder formations in\r\nIreland that if such Miocene land existed it must have been broken up or\r\npartially broken up at the epoch of the glacial or boulder period.\r\n\r\nAll objections thankfully received.\r\n\r\nEver most sincerely,\r\n\r\nEDWARD FORBES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 21. TO L. JENYNS (BLOMEFIELD). Down. [1846].\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your note and kind intended present of your\r\nvolume. (21/1. No doubt the late Mr. Blomefield's \"Observations in\r\nNatural History.\" See \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 31.) I feel sure I\r\nshall like it, for all discussions and observations on what the world\r\nwould call trifling points in Natural History always appear to me very\r\ninteresting. In such foreign periodicals as I have seen, there are no\r\nsuch papers as White, or Waterton, or some few other naturalists in\r\nLoudon's and Charlesworth's Journal, would have written; and a great\r\nloss it has always appeared to me. I should have much liked to have met\r\nyou in London, but I cannot leave home, as my wife is recovering from\r\na rather sharp fever attack, and I am myself slaving to finish my S.\r\nAmerican Geology (21/2. \"Geological Observations in South America\"\r\n(London), 1846.), of which, thanks to all Plutonic powers, two-thirds\r\nare through the press, and then I shall feel a comparatively free man.\r\nHave you any thoughts of Southampton? (21/3. The British Association\r\nmet at Southampton in 1846.) I have some vague idea of going there, and\r\nshould much enjoy meeting you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 22. TO J.D. HOOKER. Shrewsbury [end of February 1846].\r\n\r\nI came here on account of my father's health, which has been sadly\r\nfailing of late, but to my great joy he has got surprisingly better...I\r\nhad not heard of your botanical appointment (22/1. Sir Joseph was\r\nappointed Botanist to the Geological Survey in 1846.), and am very glad\r\nof it, more especially as it will make you travel and give you change\r\nof work and relaxation. Will you some time have to examine the Chalk and\r\nits junction with London Clay and Greensand? If so our house would be\r\na good central place, and my horse would be at your disposal. Could you\r\nnot spin a long week out of this examination? it would in truth delight\r\nus, and you could bring your papers (like Lyell) and work at odd times.\r\nForbes has been writing to me about his subsidence doctrines; I wish I\r\nhad heard his full details, but I have expressed to him in my ignorance\r\nmy objections, which rest merely on its too great hypothetical basis;\r\nI shall be curious, when I meet him, to hear what he says. He is\r\nalso speculating on the gulf-weed. I confess I cannot appreciate his\r\nreasoning about his Miocene continent, but I daresay it is from want of\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nYou allude to the Sicily flora not being peculiar, and this being caused\r\nby its recent elevation (well established) in the main part: you will\r\nfind Lyell has put forward this very clearly and well. The Apennines\r\n(which I was somewhere lately reading about) seems a very curious case.\r\n\r\nI think Forbes ought to allude a little to Lyell's (22/2. See Letter\r\n19.) work on nearly the same subject as his speculations; not that I\r\nmean that Forbes wishes to take the smallest credit from him or any man\r\nalive; no man, as far as I see, likes so much to give credit to others,\r\nor more soars above the petty craving for self-celebrity.\r\n\r\nIf you come to any more conclusions about polymorphism, I should be very\r\nglad to hear the result: it is delightful to have many points fermenting\r\nin one's brain, and your letters and conclusions always give one plenty\r\nof this same fermentation. I wish I could even make any return for all\r\nyour facts, views, and suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 23. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(23/1. The following extract gives the germ of what developed into an\r\ninteresting discussion in the \"Origin\" (Edition I., page 147). Darwin\r\nwrote, \"I suspect also that some cases of compensation which have been\r\nadvanced and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a more\r\ngeneral principle: namely, that natural selection is continually trying\r\nto economise in every part of the organism.\" He speaks of the general\r\nbelief of botanists in compensation, but does not quote any instances.)\r\n\r\n[September 1846].\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought of G. St. Hilaire's \"loi de balancement\" (23/2.\r\nAccording to Darwin (\"Variation of Animals and Plants,\" 2nd edition,\r\nII., page 335) the law of balancement was propounded by Goethe and\r\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772-1844) nearly at the same time, but he gives\r\nno reference to the works of these authors. It appears, however, from\r\nhis son Isidore's \"Vie, Travaux etc., d'Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire,\"\r\nParis 1847, page 214, that the law was given in his \"Philosophie\r\nAnatomique,\" of which the first part was published in 1818. Darwin\r\n(ibid.) gives some instances of the law holding good in plants.), as\r\napplied to plants? I am well aware that some zoologists quite reject it,\r\nbut it certainly appears to me that it often holds good with animals.\r\nYou are no doubt aware of the kind of facts I refer to, such as\r\ngreat development of canines in the carnivora apparently causing\r\na diminution--a compensation or balancement--in the small size of\r\npremolars, etc. I have incidentally noticed some analogous remarks on\r\nplants, but have never seen it discussed by botanists. Can you think\r\nof cases in any one species in genus, or genus in family, with certain\r\nparts extra developed, and some adjoining parts reduced? In varieties\r\nof the same species double flowers and large fruits seem something of\r\nthis--want of pollen and of seeds balancing with the increased number\r\nof petals and development of fruit. I hope we shall see you here this\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\n\r\n(24/1. In this year (1847) Darwin wrote a short review of Waterhouse's\r\n\"Natural History of the Mammalia,\" of which the first volume had\r\nappeared. It was published in \"The Annals and Magazine of Natural\r\nHistory,\" Volume XIX., page 53. The following sentence is the only one\r\nwhich shows even a trace of evolution: \"whether we view classification\r\nas a mere contrivance to convey much information in a single word, or as\r\nsomething more than a memoria technica, and as connected with the laws\r\nof creation, we cannot doubt that where such important differences in\r\nthe generative and cerebral systems, as distinguish the Marsupiata from\r\nthe Placentata, run through two series of animals, they ought to be\r\narranged under heads of equal value.\"\r\n\r\nA characteristic remark occurs in reference to Geographical\r\nDistribution, \"that noble subject of which we as yet but dimly see the\r\nfull bearing.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter seems to be of sufficient interest to be published\r\nin spite of the obscurities caused by the want of date. It seems to have\r\nbeen written after 1847, in which year a dispute involving Dr. King and\r\nseveral \"arctic gentlemen\" was carried on in the \"Athenaeum.\" Mr. Darwin\r\nspeaks of \"Natural History Instructions for the present expedition.\"\r\nThis may possibly refer to the \"Admiralty Manual of Scientific Enquiry\"\r\n(1849), for it is clear, from the prefatory memorandum of the Lords\r\nof the Admiralty, that they believed the manual would be of use in the\r\nforthcoming expeditions in search of Sir John Franklin.)\r\n\r\nLETTER 24. TO E. CRESY.\r\n\r\n(24/2. Mr. Cresy was, we believe, an architect: his friendship with Mr.\r\nDarwin dates from the settlement at Down.)\r\n\r\nDown [after 1847].\r\n\r\nAlthough I have never particularly attended to the points in dispute\r\nbetween Dr. (Richard) King and the other Arctic gentlemen, yet I have\r\ncarefully read all the articles in the \"Athenaeum,\" and took from them\r\nmuch the same impression as you convey in your letter, for which I thank\r\nyou. I believe that old sinner, Sir J. Barrow (24/3. Sir John Barrow,\r\n(1764-1848): Secretary to the Admiralty. has been at the bottom of all\r\nthe money wasted over the naval expeditions. So strongly have I felt on\r\nthis subject, that, when I was appointed on a committee for Nat. Hist.\r\ninstructions for the present expedition, had I been able to attend I had\r\nresolved to express my opinion on the little advantage, comparatively\r\nto the expense, gained by them. There have been, I believe, from\r\nthe beginning eighteen expeditions; this strikes me as monstrous,\r\nconsidering how little is known, for instance, on the interior of\r\nAustralia. The country has paid dear for Sir John's hobbyhorse. I have\r\nvery little doubt that Dr. King is quite right in the advantage of land\r\nexpeditions as far as geography is concerned; and that is now the chief\r\nobject. (24/4. This sentence would imply that Darwin thought it hopeless\r\nto rescue Sir J. Franklin's expedition. If so, the letter must be, at\r\nleast, as late as 1850. If the eighteen expeditions mentioned above\r\nare \"search expeditions,\" it would also bring the date of the letter to\r\n1850.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 25. TO RICHARD OWEN. Down [March 26th, 1848].\r\n\r\nMy dear Owen\r\n\r\nI do not know whether your MS. instructions are sent in; but even\r\nif they are not sent in, I daresay what I am going to write will be\r\nabsolutely superfluous (25/1. The results of Mr. Darwin's experience\r\ngiven in the above letter were embodied by Prof. Owen in the section \"On\r\nthe Use of the Microscope on Board Ship,\" forming part of the article\r\n\"Zoology\" in the \"Manual of Scientific Enquiry, Prepared for the Use of\r\nHer Majesty's Navy\" (London, 1849).), but I have derived such infinitely\r\ngreat advantage from my new simple microscope, in comparison with the\r\none which I used on board the \"Beagle,\" and which was recommended to me\r\nby R. Brown (\"Life and Letters,\" I., page 145.), that I cannot forego\r\nthe mere chance of advantage of urging this on you. The leading point\r\nof difference consists simply in having the stage for saucers very large\r\nand fixed. Mine will hold a saucer three inches in inside diameter.\r\nI have never seen such a microscope as mine, though Chevalier's (from\r\nwhose plan many points of mine are taken), of Paris, approaches it\r\npretty closely. I fully appreciate the utter ABSURDITY of my giving\r\nyou advice about means of dissecting; but I have appreciated myself the\r\nenormous disadvantage of having worked with a bad instrument, though\r\nthought a few years since the best. Please to observe that without you\r\ncall especial attention to this point, those ignorant of Natural History\r\nwill be sure to get one of the fiddling instruments sold in shops.\r\nIf you thought fit, I would point out the differences, which, from my\r\nexperience, make a useful microscope for the kind of dissection of\r\nthe invertebrates which a person would be likely to attempt on board a\r\nvessel. But pray again believe that I feel the absurdity of this letter,\r\nand I write merely from the chance of yourself, possessing great skill\r\nand having worked with good instruments, [not being] possibly fully\r\naware what an astonishing difference the kind of microscope makes for\r\nthose who have not been trained in skill for dissection under water.\r\nWhen next I come to town (I was prevented last time by illness) I must\r\ncall on you, and report, for my own satisfaction, a really (I think)\r\ncurious point I have made out in my beloved barnacles. You cannot tell\r\nhow much I enjoyed my talk with you here.\r\n\r\nEver, my dear Owen, Yours sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--If I do not hear, I shall understand that my letter is\r\nsuperfluous. Smith and Beck were so pleased with the simple microscope\r\nthey made for me, that they have made another as a model. If you are\r\nconsulted by any young naturalists, do recommend them to look at this.\r\nI really feel quite a personal gratitude to this form of microscope, and\r\nquite a hatred to my old one.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 26. TO J.S. HENSLOW. Down [April 1st, 1848.]\r\n\r\nThank you for your note and giving me a chance of seeing you in town;\r\nbut it was out of my power to take advantage of it, for I had previously\r\narranged to go up to London on Monday. I should have much enjoyed\r\nseeing you. Thanks also for your address (26/1. An introductory lecture\r\ndelivered in March 1848 at the first meeting of a Society \"for giving\r\ninstructions to the working classes in Ipswich in various branches of\r\nscience, and more especially in natural history\" (\"Memoir of the Rev.\r\nJ.S. Henslow,\" by Leonard Jenyns, page 150.), which I like very much.\r\nThe anecdote about Whewell and the tides I had utterly forgotten; I\r\nbelieve it is near enough to the truth. I rather demur to one sentence\r\nof yours--viz., \"However delightful any scientific pursuit may be, yet,\r\nif it should be wholly unapplied, it is of no more use than building\r\ncastles in the air.\" Would not your hearers infer from this that the\r\npractical use of each scientific discovery ought to be immediate and\r\nobvious to make it worthy of admiration? What a beautiful instance\r\nchloroform is of a discovery made from purely scientific researches,\r\nafterwards coming almost by chance into practical use! For myself I\r\nwould, however, take higher ground, for I believe there exists, and I\r\nfeel within me, an instinct for truth, or knowledge or discovery, of\r\nsomething of the same nature as the instinct of virtue, and that our\r\nhaving such an instinct is reason enough for scientific researches\r\nwithout any practical results ever ensuing from them. You will wonder\r\nwhat makes me run on so, but I have been working very hard for the last\r\neighteen months on the anatomy, etc., of the Cirripedia (on which I\r\nshall publish a monograph), and some of my friends laugh at me, and I\r\nfear the study of the Cirripedia will ever remain \"wholly unapplied,\"\r\nand yet I feel that such study is better than castle-building.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 27. TO J.D. HOOKER, at Dr. Falconer's, Botanic Garden, Calcutta.\r\nDown, May 10th, 1848.\r\n\r\nI was indeed delighted to see your handwriting; but I felt almost sorry\r\nwhen I beheld how long a letter you had written. I know that you are\r\nindomitable in work, but remember how precious your time is, and do not\r\nwaste it on your friends, however much pleasure you may give them. Such\r\na letter would have cost me half-a-day's work. How capitally you seem\r\ngoing on! I do envy you the sight of all the glorious vegetation. I am\r\nmuch pleased and surprised that you have been able to observe so much in\r\nthe animal world. No doubt you keep a journal, and an excellent one it\r\nwill be, I am sure, when published. All these animal facts will tell\r\ncapitally in it. I can quite comprehend the difficulty you mention about\r\nnot knowing what is known zoologically in India; but facts observed, as\r\nyou will observe them, are none the worse for reiterating. Did you see\r\nMr. Blyth in Calcutta? He would be a capital man to tell you what is\r\nknown about Indian Zoology, at least in the Vertebrata. He is a very\r\nclever, odd, wild fellow, who will never do what he could do, from not\r\nsticking to any one subject. By the way, if you should see him at any\r\ntime, try not to forget to remember me very kindly to him; I liked all I\r\nsaw of him. Your letter was the very one to charm me, with all its facts\r\nfor my Species-book, and truly obliged I am for so kind a remembrance\r\nof me. Do not forget to make enquiries about the origin, even if only\r\ntraditionally known, of any varieties of domestic quadrupeds, birds,\r\nsilkworms, etc. Are there domestic bees? if so hives ought to be brought\r\nhome. Of all the facts you mention, that of the wild [illegible], when\r\nbreeding with the domestic, producing offspring somewhat sterile, is the\r\nmost surprising: surely they must be different species. Most zoologists\r\nwould absolutely disbelieve such a statement, and consider the result as\r\na proof that they were distinct species. I do not go so far as that,\r\nbut the case seems highly improbable. Blyth has studied the Indian\r\nRuminantia. I have been much struck about what you say of lowland plants\r\nascending mountains, but the alpine not descending. How I do hope you\r\nwill get up some mountains in Borneo; how curious the result will be!\r\nBy the way, I never heard from you what affinity the Maldive flora has,\r\nwhich is cruel, as you tempted me by making me guess. I sometimes groan\r\nover your Indian journey, when I think over all your locked up riches.\r\nWhen shall I see a memoir on Insular floras, and on the Pacific? What\r\na grand subject Alpine floras of the world (27/1. Mr. William Botting\r\nHemsley, F.R.S., of the Royal Gardens, Kew, is now engaged on a\r\nmonograph of the high-level Alpine plants of the world.) would be,\r\nas far as known; and then you have never given a coup d'oeil on the\r\nsimilarity and dissimilarity of Arctic and Antarctic floras. Well, thank\r\nheavens, when you do come back you will be nolens volens a fixture. I am\r\nparticularly glad you have been at the Coal; I have often since you went\r\ngone on maundering on the subject, and I shall never rest easy in Down\r\nchurchyard without the problem be solved by some one before I die.\r\nTalking of dying makes me tell you that my confounded stomach is much\r\nthe same; indeed, of late has been rather worse, but for the last year,\r\nI think, I have been able to do more work. I have done nothing besides\r\nthe barnacles, except, indeed, a little theoretical paper on erratic\r\nboulders (27/2. \"On the Transportal of Erratic Boulders from a Lower to\r\na Higher Level\" (\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume IV., pages 315-23.\r\n1848). In this paper Darwin favours the view that the transport of\r\nboulders was effected by coast-ice. An earlier paper entitled \"Notes on\r\nthe Effects produced by the ancient Glaciers of Caernarvonshire, and on\r\nthe Boulders transported by floating Ice\" (\"Phil. Mag.\" 1842, page 352)\r\nis spoken of by Sir Archibald Geikie as standing \"almost at the top of\r\nthe long list of English contributions to the history of the Ice\r\nAge\" (\"Charles Darwin,\" \"Nature\" Series, page 23).), and Scientific\r\nGeological Instructions for the Admiralty Volume (27/3. \"A manual of\r\nScientific Enquiry, prepared for the use of Her Majesty's Navy, and\r\nadapted for Travellers in General.\" Edited by Sir John F.W. Herschel,\r\nBart. Section VI.--Geology--by Charles Darwin. London, 1849. See \"Life\r\nand Letters,\" pages 328-9.), which cost me some trouble. This work,\r\nwhich is edited by Sir J. Herschel, is a very good job, inasmuch as\r\nthe captains of men-of-war will now see that the Admiralty cares for\r\nscience, and so will favour naturalists on board. As for a man who is\r\nnot scientific by nature, I do not believe instructions will do him any\r\ngood; and if he be scientific and good for anything the instructions\r\nwill be superfluous. I do not know who does the Botany; Owen does the\r\nZoology, and I have sent him an account of my new simple microscope,\r\nwhich I consider perfect, even better than yours by Chevalier. N.B. I\r\nhave got a 1/8 inch object-glass, and it is grand. I have been getting\r\non well with my beloved Cirripedia, and get more skilful in dissection.\r\nI have worked out the nervous system pretty well in several genera,\r\nand made out their ears and nostrils (27/4. For the olfactory sacs see\r\nDarwin's \"Monograph of the Cirripedia,\" 1851, page 52.), which were\r\nquite unknown. I have lately got a bisexual cirripede, the male being\r\nmicroscopically small and parasitic within the sack of the female. I\r\ntell you this to boast of my species theory, for the nearest closely\r\nallied genus to it is, as usual, hermaphrodite, but I had observed some\r\nminute parasites adhering to it, and these parasites I now can show are\r\nsupplemental males, the male organs in the hermaphrodite being unusually\r\nsmall, though perfect and containing zoosperms: so we have almost a\r\npolygamous animal, simple females alone being wanting. I never should\r\nhave made this out, had not my species theory convinced me, that an\r\nhermaphrodite species must pass into a bisexual species by insensibly\r\nsmall stages; and here we have it, for the male organs in the\r\nhermaphrodite are beginning to fail, and independent males ready formed.\r\nBut I can hardly explain what I mean, and you will perhaps wish my\r\nbarnacles and species theory al Diavolo together. But I don't care what\r\nyou say, my species theory is all gospel. We have had only one party\r\nhere: viz., of the Lyells, Forbes, Owen, and Ramsay, and we both missed\r\nyou and Falconer very much...I know more of your history than you will\r\nsuppose, for Miss Henslow most good-naturedly sent me a packet of your\r\nletters, and she wrote me so nice a little note that it made me quite\r\nproud. I have not heard of anything in the scientific line which\r\nwould interest you. Sir H. De la Beche (27/5. The Presidential Address\r\ndelivered by De la Beche before the Geological Society in 1848 (\"Quart.\r\nJourn. Geol. Soc.\" Volume IV., \"Proceedings,\" page xxi, 1848).) gave a\r\nvery long and rather dull address; the most interesting part was from\r\nSir J. Ross. Mr. Beete Jukes figured in it very prominently: it really\r\nis a very nice quality in Sir Henry, the manner in which he pushes\r\nforward his subordinates. Jukes has since read what was considered a\r\nvery valuable paper. The man, not content with moustaches, now sports\r\nan entire beard, and I am sure thinks himself like Jupiter tonans. There\r\nwas a short time since a not very creditable discussion at a meeting\r\nof the Royal Society, where Owen fell foul of Mantell with fury and\r\ncontempt about belemnites. What wretched doings come from the order of\r\nfame; the love of truth alone would never make one man attack another\r\nbitterly. My paper is full, so I must wish you with all my heart\r\nfarewell. Heaven grant that your health may keep good.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 28. TO J.S. HENSLOW. The Lodge, Malvern, May 6th, 1849.\r\n\r\nYour kind note has been forwarded to me here. You will be surprised to\r\nhear that we all--children, servants, and all--have been here for nearly\r\ntwo months. All last autumn and winter my health grew worse and worse:\r\nincessant sickness, tremulous hands, and swimming head. I thought I was\r\ngoing the way of all flesh. Having heard of much success in some cases\r\nfrom the cold-water cure, I determined to give up all attempts to do\r\nanything and come here and put myself under Dr. Gully. It has answered\r\nto a considerable extent: my sickness much checked and considerable\r\nstrength gained. Dr. G., moreover (and I hear he rarely speaks\r\nconfidently), tells me he has little doubt but that he can cure me in\r\nthe course of time--time, however, it will take. I have experienced\r\nenough to feel sure that the cold-water cure is a great and powerful\r\nagent and upsetter of all constitutional habits. Talking of habits, the\r\ncruel wretch has made me leave off snuff--that chief solace of life. We\r\nthank you most sincerely for your prompt and early invitation to Hitcham\r\nfor the British Association for 1850 (28/1. The invitation was probably\r\nnot for 1850, but for 1851, when the Association met at Ipswich.): if\r\nI am made well and strong, most gladly will I accept it; but as I have\r\nbeen hitherto, a drive every day of half a dozen miles would be more\r\nthan I could stand with attending any of the sections. I intend going to\r\nBirmingham (28/2. The Association met at Birmingham in 1849.) if able;\r\nindeed, I am bound to attempt it, for I am honoured beyond all measure\r\nin being one of the Vice-Presidents. I am uncommonly glad you will be\r\nthere; I fear, however, we shall not have any such charming trips as\r\nNuneham and Dropmore. (28/3. In a letter to Hooker (October 12th, 1849)\r\nDarwin speaks of \"that heavenly day at Dropmore.\" (\"Life and Letters,\"\r\nI., page 379.)) We shall stay here till at least June 1st, perhaps till\r\nJuly 1st; and I shall have to go on with the aqueous treatment at home\r\nfor several more months. One most singular effect of the treatment\r\nis that it induces in most people, and eminently in my case, the most\r\ncomplete stagnation of mind. I have ceased to think even of barnacles!\r\nI heard some time since from Hooker...How capitally he seems to have\r\nsucceeded in all his enterprises! You must be very busy now. I happened\r\nto be thinking the other day over the Gamlingay trip to the Lilies\r\nof the Valley (28/4. The Lily of the Valley (Convallaria majalis)\r\nis recorded from Gamlingay by Professor Babington in his \"Flora of\r\nCambridgeshire,\" page 234. (London, 1860.)): ah, those were delightful\r\ndays when one had no such organ as a stomach, only a mouth and the\r\nmasticating appurtenances. I am very much surprised at what you say,\r\nthat men are beginning to work in earnest [at] Botany. What a loss it\r\nwill be for Natural History that you have ceased to reside all the year\r\nin Cambridge!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 29. TO J.F. ROYLE. Down, September 1st [184-?].\r\n\r\nI return you with very many thanks your valuable work. I am sure I\r\nhave not lost any slip or disarranged the loose numbers. I have been\r\ninterested by looking through the volumes, though I have not found quite\r\nso much as I had thought possible about the varieties of the Indian\r\ndomestic animals and plants, and the attempts at introduction have been\r\ntoo recent for the effects (if any) of climate to have been developed.\r\nI have, however, been astonished and delighted at the evidence of the\r\nenergetic attempts to do good by such numbers of people, and most of\r\nthem evidently not personally interested in the result. Long may\r\nour rule flourish in India. I declare all the labour shown in\r\nthese transactions is enough by itself to make one proud of one's\r\ncountrymen...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 30. TO HUGH STRICKLAND.\r\n\r\n(30/1. The first paragraph of this letter is published in the \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" I., page 372, as part of a series of letters to Strickland,\r\nbeginning at page 365, where a biographical note by Professor Newton is\r\nalso given. Professor Newton wrote: \"In 1841 he brought the subject\r\nof Natural History Nomenclature before the British Association, and\r\nprepared the code of rules for Zoological Nomenclature, now known by his\r\nname--the principles of which are very generally accepted.\" Mr. Darwin's\r\nreasons against appending the describer's name to that of the species\r\nare given in \"Life and Letters,\" page 366. The present letter is\r\nof interest as giving additional details in regard to Darwin's\r\ndifficulties.)\r\n\r\nDown, February 10th [1849].\r\n\r\nI have again to thank you cordially for your letter. Your remarks shall\r\nfructify to some extent, and I will try to be more faithful to rigid\r\nvirtue and priority; but as for calling Balanus \"Lepas\" (which I did\r\nnot think of) I cannot do it, my pen won't write it--it is impossible. I\r\nhave great hopes some of my difficulties will disappear, owing to wrong\r\ndates in Agassiz and to my having to run several genera into one; for I\r\nhave as yet gone, in but few cases, to original sources. With respect to\r\nadopting my own notions in my Cirripedia book, I should not like to do\r\nso without I found others approved, and in some public way; nor indeed\r\nis it well adapted, as I can never recognise a species without I have\r\nthe original specimen, which fortunately I have in many cases in the\r\nBritish Museum. Thus far I mean to adopt my notion, in never putting\r\nmihi or Darwin after my own species, and in the anatomical text giving\r\nno authors' names at all, as the systematic part will serve for those\r\nwho want to know the history of the species as far as I can imperfectly\r\nwork it out.\r\n\r\nI have had a note from W. Thompson (30/2. Mr. Thompson is described in\r\nthe preface to the Lepadidae as \"the distinguished Natural Historian\r\nof Ireland.\") this morning, and he tells me Ogleby has some scheme\r\nidentical almost with mine. I feel pretty sure there is a growing\r\ngeneral aversion to the appendage of author's name, except in cases\r\nwhere necessary. Now at this moment I have seen specimens ticketed with\r\na specific name and no reference--such are hopelessly inconvenient;\r\nbut I declare I would rather (as saving time) have a reference to some\r\nsecond systematic work than to the original author, for I have cases of\r\nthis which hardly help me at all, for I know not where to look amongst\r\nendless periodical foreign papers. On the other hand, one can get hold\r\nof most systematic works and so follow up the scent, and a species does\r\nnot long lie buried exclusively in a paper.\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your very kind offer of occasionally assisting\r\nme with your opinion, and I will not trespass much. I have a case, but\r\n[it is one] about which I am almost sure; and so to save you writing, if\r\nI conclude rightly, pray do not answer, and I shall understand silence\r\nas assent.\r\n\r\nOlfers in 1814 made Lepas aurita Linn. into the genus Conchoderma;\r\n[Oken] in 1815 gave the name Branta to Lepas aurita and vittata, and\r\nby so doing he alters essentially Olfers' generic definition. Oken was\r\nright (as it turns out), and Lepas aurita and vittata must form together\r\none genus. (30/3. In the \"Monograph on the Cirripedia\" (Lepadidae) the\r\nnames used are Conchoderma aurita and virgata.) (I leave out of question\r\na multitude of subsequent synonyms.) Now I suppose I must retain\r\nConchoderma of Olfers. I cannot make out a precise rule in the \"British\r\nAssociation Report\" for this. When a genus is cut into two I see that\r\nthe old name is retained for part and altered to it; so I suppose the\r\ndefinition may be enlarged to receive another species--though the cases\r\nare somewhat different. I should have had no doubt if Lepas aurita and\r\nvittata had been made into two genera, for then when run together the\r\noldest of the two would have been retained. Certainly to put Conchoderma\r\nOlfers is not quite correct when applied to the two species, for such\r\nwas not Olfers' definition and opinion. If I do not hear, I shall retain\r\nConchoderma for the two species...\r\n\r\nP.S.--Will you by silence give consent to the following?\r\n\r\nLinnaeus gives no type to his genus Lepas, though L. balanus comes\r\nfirst. Several oldish authors have used Lepas exclusively for the\r\npedunculate division, and the name has been given to the family and\r\ncompounded in sub-generic names. Now, this shows that old authors\r\nattached the name Lepas more particularly to the pedunculate division.\r\nNow, if I were to use Lepas for Anatifera (30/4. Anatifera and Anatifa\r\nwere used as generic names for what Linnaeus and Darwin called Lepas\r\nanatifera.) I should get rid of the difficulty of the second edition of\r\nHill and of the difficulty of Anatifera vel Anatifa. Linnaeus's generic\r\ndescription is equally applicable to Anatifera and Balanus, though the\r\nlatter stands first. Must the mere precedence rigorously outweigh the\r\napparent opinion of many old naturalists? As for using Lepas in place\r\nof Balanus, I cannot. Every one will understand what is meant by Lepas\r\nAnatifera, so that convenience would be wonderfully thus suited. If I do\r\nnot hear, I shall understand I have your consent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 31. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(31/1. In the \"Life and Letters,\" I., page 392, is a letter to Sir J.D.\r\nHooker from Mr. Darwin, to whom the former had dedicated his \"Himalayan\r\nJournals.\" Mr. Darwin there wrote: \"Your letter, received this morning,\r\nhas interested me extremely, and I thank you sincerely for telling me\r\nyour old thoughts and aspirations.\" The following is the letter referred\r\nto, which at our request Sir Joseph has allowed us to publish.)\r\n\r\nKew, March 1st, 1854.\r\n\r\nNow that my book (31/2. \"Himalayan Journals,\" 2 volumes. London, 1854.)\r\nhas been publicly acknowledged to be of some value, I feel bold to\r\nwrite to you; for, to tell you the truth, I have never been without a\r\nmisgiving that the dedication might prove a very bad compliment, however\r\nkindly I knew you would receive it. The idea of the dedication has been\r\npresent to me from a very early date: it was formed during the Antarctic\r\nvoyage, out of love for your own \"Journal,\" and has never deserted me\r\nsince; nor would it, I think, had I never known more of you than by\r\nreport and as the author of the said \"Naturalist's Journal.\" Short of\r\nthe gratification I felt in getting the book out, I know no greater than\r\nyour kind, hearty acceptation of the dedication; and, had the reviewers\r\ngibbeted me, the dedication would alone have given me real pain. I have\r\nno wish to assume a stoical indifference to public opinion, for I am\r\nwell alive to it, and the critics might have irritated me sorely, but\r\nthey could never have caused me the regret that the association of your\r\nname with a bad book of mine would have.\r\n\r\nYou will laugh when I tell you that, my book out, I feel past the\r\nmeridian of life! But you do not know how from my earliest childhood I\r\nnourished and cherished the desire to make a creditable journey in a new\r\ncountry, and write such a respectable account of its natural features as\r\nshould give me a niche amongst the scientific explorers of the globe\r\nI inhabit, and hand my name down as a useful contributor of original\r\nmatter. A combination of most rare advantages has enabled me to gain\r\nas much of my object as contents me, for I never wished to be greatest\r\namongst you, nor did rivalry ever enter my thoughts. No ulterior object\r\nhas ever been present to me in this pursuit. My ambition is fully\r\ngratified by the satisfactory completion of my task, and I am now happy\r\nto go on jog-trot at Botany till the end of my days--downhill, in one\r\nsense, all the way. I shall never have such another object to work for,\r\nnor shall I feel the want of it...As it is, the craving of thirty\r\nyears is satisfied, and I now look back on life in a way I never could\r\npreviously. There never was a past hitherto to me. The phantom was\r\nalways in view; mayhap it is only a \"ridiculus mus\" after all, but it is\r\nbig enough for me...\r\n\r\n\r\n(PLATE: T.H. HUXLEY, 1857. Maull & Polyblank photo., Walker & Cockerell\r\nph. sc.)\r\n\r\n(32/1. The story of Huxley's life has been fully given in the\r\ninteresting biography edited by Mr. Leonard Huxley. (32/2. \"Life and\r\nLetters of Thomas Henry Huxley.\" London 1900.) Readers of this book and\r\nof the \"Life and Letters of Charles Darwin\" gain an insight into the\r\nrelationship between this pair of friends to which any words of ours can\r\nadd but little. Darwin realised to the full the essential strength of\r\nMr. Huxley's nature; he knew, as all the world now knows, the delicate\r\nsense of honour of his friend, and he was ever inclined to lean on his\r\nguidance in practical matters, as on an elder brother. Of Mr. Huxley's\r\ndialectical and literary skill he was an enthusiastic admirer, and\r\nhe never forgot what his theories owed to the fighting powers of his\r\n\"general agent.\" (32/3. Ibid., I., page 171.) Huxley's estimate of\r\nDarwin is very interesting: he valued him most highly for what was so\r\nstrikingly characteristic of himself--the love of truth. He spoke of\r\nfinding in him \"something bigger than ordinary humanity--an unequalled\r\nsimplicity and directness of purpose--a sublime unselfishness.\" (32/4.\r\nIbid., II., page 94. Huxley is speaking of Gordon's death, and goes on:\r\n\"Of all the people whom I have met with in my life, he and Darwin are\r\nthe two in whom I have found,\" etc.) The same point of view comes out in\r\nHuxley's estimate of Darwin's mental power. (32/5. Ibid., II., page\r\n39.) \"He had a clear, rapid intelligence, a great memory, a vivid\r\nimagination, and what made his greatness was the strict subordination of\r\nall these to his love of truth.\" This, as an analysis of Darwin's mental\r\nequipment, seems to us incomplete, though we do not pretend to mend\r\nit. We do not think it is possible to dissect and label the complex\r\nqualities which go to make up that which we all recognise as genius.\r\nBut, if we may venture to criticise, we would say that Mr. Huxley's\r\nwords do not seem to cover that supreme power of seeing and thinking\r\nwhat the rest of the world had overlooked, which was one of Darwin's\r\nmost striking characteristics. As throwing light on the quality of their\r\nfriendship, we give below a letter which has already appeared in the\r\n\"Life and Letters of T.H. Huxley,\" I., page 366. Mr. L. Huxley gives an\r\naccount of the breakdown in health which convinced Huxley's friends that\r\nrest and relief from anxiety must be found for him. Mr. L. Huxley aptly\r\nremarks of the letter, \"It is difficult to say whether it does more\r\nhonour to him who sent it or to him who received it.\" (32/6. Huxley's\r\n\"Life,\" I., page 366. Mr. Darwin left to Mr. Huxley a legacy of 1,000\r\npounds, \"as a slight memorial of my lifelong affection and respect for\r\nhim.\"))\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 32. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, April 23rd, 1873.\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley\r\n\r\nI have been asked by some of your friends (eighteen in number) to inform\r\nyou that they have placed, through Robarts, Lubbock & Co., the sum\r\nof 2,100 pounds to your account at your bankers. We have done this\r\nto enable you to get such complete rest as you may require for the\r\nre-establishment of your health; and in doing this we are convinced that\r\nwe act for the public interest, as well as in accordance with our most\r\nearnest desires. Let me assure you that we are all your warm personal\r\nfriends, and that there is not a stranger or mere acquaintance amongst\r\nus. If you could have heard what was said, or could have read what\r\nwas, as I believe, our inmost thoughts, you would know that we all feel\r\ntowards you, as we should to an honoured and much loved brother. I am\r\nsure that you will return this feeling, and will therefore be glad to\r\ngive us the opportunity of aiding you in some degree, as this will be a\r\nhappiness to us to the last day of our lives. Let me add that our plan\r\noccurred to several of your friends at nearly the same time and quite\r\nindependently of one another.\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley, Your affectionate friend, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 33. TO T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n(33/1. The following letter is one of the earliest of the long series\r\naddressed to Mr. Huxley.)\r\n\r\nDown, April 23rd [1854].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir\r\n\r\nI have got out all the specimens, which I have thought could by any\r\npossibility be of any use to you; but I have not looked at them, and\r\nknow not what state they are in, but should be much pleased if they are\r\nof the smallest use to you. I enclose a catalogue of habitats: I thought\r\nmy notes would have turned out of more use. I have copied out such few\r\npoints as perhaps would not be apparent in preserved specimens. The\r\nbottle shall go to Mr. Gray on Thursday next by our weekly carrier.\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your paper on the Mollusca (33/2. The paper\r\nof Huxley's is \"On the Morphology of the Cephalous Mollusca, etc.\"\r\n(\"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\" Volume 143, Part I., 1853, page 29.)); I have\r\nread it all with much interest: but it would be ridiculous in me to make\r\nany remarks on a subject on which I am so utterly ignorant; but I can\r\nsee its high importance. The discovery of the type or \"idea\" (33/3.\r\nHuxley defines his use of the word \"archetype\" at page 50: \"All that I\r\nmean is the conception of a form embodying the most general propositions\r\nthat can be affirmed respecting the Cephalous Mollusca, standing in the\r\nsame relation to them as the diagram to a geometrical theorem, and like\r\nit, at once, imaginary and true.\") (in your sense, for I detest the word\r\nas used by Owen, Agassiz & Co.) of each great class, I cannot doubt,\r\nis one of the very highest ends of Natural History; and certainly most\r\ninteresting to the worker-out. Several of your remarks have interested\r\nme: I am, however, surprised at what you say versus \"anamorphism\" (33/4.\r\nThe passage referred to is at page 63: \"If, however, all Cephalous\r\nMollusks...be only modifications by excess or defect of the parts of\r\na definite archetype, then, I think, it follows as a necessary\r\nconsequence, that no anamorphism takes place in this group. There is\r\nno progression from a lower to a higher type, but merely a more or\r\nless complete evolution of one type.\" Huxley seems to use the term\r\nanamorphism in a sense differing from that of some writers. Thus in\r\nJourdan's \"Dictionnaire des Termes Usites dans les Sciences Naturelles,\"\r\n1834, it is defined as the production of an atypical form either by\r\narrest or excess of development.), I should have thought that the\r\narchetype in imagination was always in some degree embryonic, and\r\ntherefore capable [of] and generally undergoing further development.\r\n\r\nIs it not an extraordinary fact, the great difference in position of the\r\nheart in different species of Cleodora? (33/5. A genus of Pteropods.) I\r\nam a believer that when any part, usually constant, differs considerably\r\nin different allied species that it will be found in some degree\r\nvariable within the limits of the same species. Thus, I should expect\r\nthat if great numbers of specimens of some of the species of Cleodora\r\nhad been examined with this object in view, the position of the heart in\r\nsome of the species would have been found variable. Can you aid me with\r\nany analogous facts?\r\n\r\nI am very much pleased to hear that you have not given up the idea of\r\nnoticing my cirripedial volume. All that I have seen since confirms\r\neverything of any importance stated in that volume--more especially I\r\nhave been able rigorously to confirm in an anomalous species, by the\r\nclearest evidence, that the actual cellular contents of the ovarian\r\ntubes, by the gland-like action of a modified portion of the continuous\r\ntube, passes into the cementing stuff: in fact cirripedes make glue out\r\nof their own unformed eggs! (33/6. On Darwin's mistake in this point see\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" III., page 2.)\r\n\r\nPray believe me, Yours sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI told the above case to Milne Edwards, and I saw he did not place the\r\nsmallest belief in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 34. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, September 2nd, [1854].\r\n\r\nMy second volume on the everlasting barnacles is at last published\r\n(34/1. \"A Monograph of the Sub-class Cirripedia. II. The Balanidae, the\r\nVerrucidae.\" Ray Society, 1854.), and I will do myself the pleasure of\r\nsending you a copy to Jermyn Street next Thursday, as I have to send\r\nanother book then to Mr. Baily.\r\n\r\nAnd now I want to ask you a favour--namely, to answer me two questions.\r\nAs you are so perfectly familiar with the doings, etc., of all\r\nContinental naturalists, I want you to tell me a few names of those\r\nwhom you think would care for my volume. I do not mean in the light of\r\npuffing my book, but I want not to send copies to those who from other\r\nstudies, age, etc., would view it as waste paper. From assistance\r\nrendered me, I consider myself bound to send copies to: (1) Bosquet of\r\nMaestricht, (2) Milne Edwards, (3) Dana, (4) Agassiz, (5) Muller, (6)\r\nW. Dunker of Hesse Cassel. Now I have five or six other copies to\r\ndistribute, and will you be so very kind as to help me? I had thought of\r\nVon Siebold, Loven, d'Orbigny, Kolliker, Sars, Kroyer, etc., but I know\r\nhardly anything about any of them.\r\n\r\nMy second question, it is merely a chance whether you can answer,--it is\r\nwhether I can send these books or any of them (in some cases accompanied\r\nby specimens), through the Royal Society: I have some vague idea of\r\nhaving heard that the Royal Society did sometimes thus assist members.\r\n\r\nI have just been reading your review of the \"Vestiges\" (34/2. In his\r\nchapter on the \"Reception of the Origin of Species\" (\"Life and Letters,\"\r\nII., pages 188-9), Mr. Huxley wrote: \"and the only review I ever have\r\nqualms of conscience about, on the ground of needless savagery, is one\r\nI wrote on the 'Vestiges.'\" The article is in the \"British and Foreign\r\nMedico-chirurgical Review,\" XIII., 1854, page 425. The \"great man\"\r\nreferred to below is Owen: see Huxley's review, page 439, and Huxley's\r\n\"Life.\" I., page 94.), and the way you handle a great Professor is\r\nreally exquisite and inimitable. I have been extremely interested in\r\nother parts, and to my mind it is incomparably the best review I have\r\nread on the \"Vestiges\"; but I cannot think but that you are rather hard\r\non the poor author. I must think that such a book, if it does no other\r\ngood, spreads the taste for Natural Science.\r\n\r\nBut I am perhaps no fair judge, for I am almost as unorthodox\r\nabout species as the \"Vestiges\" itself, though I hope not quite so\r\nunphilosophical. How capitally you analyse his notion about law. I\r\ndo not know when I have read a review which interested me so much. By\r\nHeavens, how the blood must have gushed into the capillaries when a\r\ncertain great man (whom with all his faults I cannot help liking) read\r\nit!\r\n\r\nI am rather sorry you do not think more of Agassiz's embryological\r\nstages (34/3. See \"Origin,\" Edition VI., page 310: also Letter 40,\r\nNote.), for though I saw how exceedingly weak the evidence was, I was\r\nled to hope in its truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 35. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1854].\r\n\r\nWith respect to \"highness\" and \"lowness,\" my ideas are only eclectic and\r\nnot very clear. It appears to me that an unavoidable wish to compare all\r\nanimals with men, as supreme, causes some confusion; and I think that\r\nnothing besides some such vague comparison is intended, or perhaps is\r\neven possible, when the question is whether two kingdoms such as the\r\nArticulata or Mollusca are the highest. Within the same kingdom I am\r\ninclined to think that \"highest\" usually means that form which has\r\nundergone most \"morphological differentiation\" from the common embryo or\r\narchetype of the class; but then every now and then one is bothered\r\n(as Milne Edwards has remarked) by \"retrograde development,\" i.e.,\r\nthe mature animal having fewer and less important organs than its own\r\nembryo. The specialisation of parts to different functions, or\r\n\"the division of physiological labour\" (35/1. A slip of the pen for\r\n\"physiological division of labour.\") of Milne Edwards exactly agrees\r\n(and to my mind is the best definition, when it can be applied)\r\nwith what you state is your idea in regard to plants. I do not think\r\nzoologists agree in any definite ideas on this subject; and my ideas are\r\nnot clearer than those of my brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 36. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, July 2nd [1854].\r\n\r\nI have had the house full of visitors, and when I talk I can do\r\nabsolutely nothing else; and since then I have been poorly enough,\r\notherwise I should have answered your letter long before this, for I\r\nenjoy extremely discussing such points as those in your last note. But\r\nwhat a villain you are to heap gratuitous insults on my ELASTIC theory:\r\nyou might as well call the virtue of a lady elastic, as the virtue of a\r\ntheory accommodating in its favours. Whatever you may say, I feel that\r\nmy theory does give me some advantages in discussing these points. But\r\nto business: I keep my notes in such a way, viz., in bulk, that I cannot\r\npossibly lay my hand on any reference; nor as far as the vegetable\r\nkingdom is concerned do I distinctly remember having read any discussion\r\non general highness or lowness, excepting Schleiden (I fancy) on\r\nCompositae being highest. Ad. de Jussieu (36/1. \"Monographie de la\r\nFamille des Malpighiacees,\" by Adrien de Jussieu, \"Arch. du Museum.\"\r\nVolume III., page 1, 1843.), in \"Arch. du Museum,\" Tome 3, discusses\r\nthe value of characters of degraded flowers in the Malpighiaceae, but I\r\ndoubt whether this at all concerns you. Mirbel somewhere has discussed\r\nsome such question.\r\n\r\nPlants lie under an enormous disadvantage in respect to such discussions\r\nin not passing through larval stages. I do not know whether you\r\ncan distinguish a plant low from non-development from one low from\r\ndegradation, which theoretically, at least, are very distinct. I must\r\nagree with Forbes that a mollusc may be higher than one articulate\r\nanimal and lower than another; if one was asked which was highest as a\r\nwhole, the Molluscan or Articulate Kingdom, I should look to and compare\r\nthe highest in each, and not compare their archetypes (supposing them to\r\nbe known, which they are not.)\r\n\r\nBut there are, in my opinion, more difficult cases than any we have\r\nalluded to, viz., that of fish--but my ideas are not clear enough, and\r\nI do not suppose you would care to hear what I obscurely think on this\r\nsubject. As far as my elastic theory goes, all I care about is that very\r\nancient organisms (when different from existing) should tend to resemble\r\nthe larval or embryological stages of the existing.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear what you say about parallelism: I am an utter\r\ndisbeliever of any parallelism more than mere accident. It is very\r\nstrange, but I think Forbes is often rather fanciful; his \"Polarity\"\r\n(36/2. See Letter 41, Note.) makes me sick--it is like \"magnetism\"\r\nturning a table.\r\n\r\nIf I can think of any one likely to take your \"Illustrations\" (36/3.\r\n\"Illustrations of Himalayan Plants from Drawings made by J.F. Cathcart.\"\r\nFolio, 1855.), I will send the advertisement. If you want to make up\r\nsome definite number so as to go to press, I will put my name down with\r\nPLEASURE (and I hope and believe that you will trust me in saying\r\nso), though I should not in the course of nature subscribe to any\r\nhorticultural work:--act for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 37. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [May] 29th, 1854.\r\n\r\nI am really truly sorry to hear about your [health]. I entreat you\r\nto write down your own case,--symptoms, and habits of life,--and then\r\nconsider your case as that of a stranger; and I put it to you, whether\r\ncommon sense would not order you to take more regular exercise and work\r\nyour brain less. (N.B. Take a cold bath and walk before breakfast.) I\r\nam certain in the long run you would not lose time. Till you have a\r\nthoroughly bad stomach, you will not know the really great evil of\r\nit, morally, physically, and every way. Do reflect and act resolutely.\r\nRemember your troubled heart-action formerly plainly told how your\r\nconstitution was tried. But I will say no more--excepting that a man\r\nis mad to risk health, on which everything, including his children's\r\ninherited health, depends. Do not hate me for this lecture. Really I am\r\nnot surprised at your having some headache after Thursday evening, for\r\nit must have been no small exertion making an abstract of all that was\r\nsaid after dinner. Your being so engaged was a bore, for there were\r\nseveral things that I should have liked to have talked over with you. It\r\nwas certainly a first-rate dinner, and I enjoyed it extremely, far more\r\nthan I expected. Very far from disagreeing with me, my London visits\r\nhave just lately taken to suit my stomach admirably; I begin to think\r\nthat dissipation, high-living, with lots of claret, is what I want,\r\nand what I had during the last visit. We are going to act on this same\r\nprinciple, and in a very profligate manner have just taken a pair of\r\nseason-tickets to see the Queen open the Crystal Palace. (37/1. Queen\r\nVictoria opened the Crystal Palace at Sydenham on June 10th, 1854.) How\r\nI wish there was any chance of your being there! The last grand thing we\r\nwere at together answered, I am sure, very well, and that was the Duke's\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nHave you seen Forbes' introductory lecture (37/2. Edward Forbes\r\nwas appointed to a Professorship at Edinburgh in May, 1854.) in the\r\n\"Scotsman\" (lent me by Horner)? it is really ADMIRABLY done, though\r\nwithout anything, perhaps, very original, which could hardly be\r\nexpected: it has given me even a higher opinion than I before had, of\r\nthe variety and polish of his intellect. It is, indeed, an irreparable\r\nloss to London natural history society. I wish, however, he would not\r\npraise so much that old brown dry stick Jameson. Altogether, to my\r\ntaste, it is much the best introductory lecture I have ever read. I hear\r\nhis anniversary address is very good.\r\n\r\nAdios, my dear Hooker; do be wise and good, and be careful of your\r\nstomach, within which, as I know full well, lie intellect, conscience,\r\ntemper, and the affections.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 38. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 2nd [1854].\r\n\r\nYou are a pretty fellow to talk of funking the returning thanks at the\r\ndinner for the medal. (38/1. The Royal medal was given to Sir Joseph\r\nin 1854.) I heard that it was decidedly the best speech of the evening,\r\ngiven \"with perfect fluency, distinctness, and command of language,\" and\r\nthat you showed great self-possession: was the latter the proverbially\r\ndesperate courage of a coward? But you are a pretty fellow to be so\r\ndesperately afraid and then to make the crack speech. Many such an\r\nordeal may you have to go through! I do not know whether Sir William\r\n[Hooker] would be contented with Lord Rosse's (38/2. President of the\r\nRoyal Society 1848-54.) speech on giving you the medal; but I am very\r\nmuch pleased with it, and really the roll of what you have done was,\r\nI think, splendid. What a great pity he half spoiled it by not having\r\ntaken the trouble just to read it over first. Poor Hofmann (38/3. August\r\nWilhelm Hofmann, the other medallist of 1854.) came off in this respect\r\neven worse. It is really almost arrogant insolence against every one not\r\nan astronomer.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I was at a very pleasant breakfast party at Sir R.\r\nInglis's. (38/4. Sir Robert Inglis, President of the British Association\r\nin 1847. Apparently Darwin was present at the afternoon meeting, but\r\nnot at the dinner.) I have received, with very many thanks, the aberrant\r\ngenera; but I have not had time to consider them, nor your remarks on\r\nAustralian botanical geography.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 39. TO T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n(39/1. The following letter shows Darwin's interest in the adjudication\r\nof the Royal medals. The year 1855 was the last during which he served\r\non the Council of the Society. He had previously served in 1849-50.)\r\n\r\nDown, March 31st, 1855.\r\n\r\nI have thought and enquired much about Westwood, and I really think he\r\namply deserves the gold medal. But should you think of some one with\r\nhigher claim I am quite ready to give up. Indeed, I suppose without I\r\nget some one to second it, I cannot propose him.\r\n\r\nWill you be so kind as to read the enclosed, and return it to me? Should\r\nI send it to Bell? That is, without you demur or convince me. I had\r\nthought of Hancock, a higher class of labourer; but, as far as I can\r\nweigh, he has not, as yet, done so much as Westwood. I may state that I\r\nread the whole \"Classification\" (39/2. Possibly Westwood's \"Introduction\r\nto the Modern Classification of Insects\" (1839).) before I was on the\r\nCouncil, and ever thought on the subject of medals. I fear my remarks\r\nare rather lengthy, but to do him justice I could not well shorten them.\r\nPray tell me frankly whether the enclosed is the right sort of thing,\r\nfor though I was once on the Council of the Royal, I never attended any\r\nmeetings, owing to bad health.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Copley medal (39/3. The Copley Medal was given to\r\nLyell in 1858.), I have a strong feeling that Lyell has a high claim,\r\nbut as he has had the Royal Medal I presume that it would be thought\r\nobjectionable to propose him; and as I intend (you not objecting and\r\nconverting me) to propose W. for the Royal, it would, of course, appear\r\nintolerably presumptuous to propose for the Copley also.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 40. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, June 10th, 1855.\r\n\r\nShall you attend the Council of the Royal Society on Thursday next? I\r\nhave not been very well of late, and I doubt whether I can attend; and\r\nif I could do anything (pray conceal the scandalous fact), I want to\r\ngo to the Crystal Palace to meet the Horners, Lyells, and a party. So I\r\nwant to know whether you will speak for me most strongly for Barrande.\r\nYou know better than I do his admirable labours on the development of\r\ntrilobites, and his most important work on his Lower or Primordial Zone.\r\nI enclose an old note of Lyell's to show what he thinks. With respect to\r\nDana, whom I also proposed, you know well his merits. I can speak most\r\nhighly of his classificatory work on crustacea and his Geographical\r\nDistribution. His Volcanic Geology is admirable, and he has done much\r\ngood work on coral reefs.\r\n\r\nIf you attend, do not answer this; but if you cannot be at the Council,\r\nplease inform me, and I suppose I must, if I can, attend.\r\n\r\nThank you for your abstract of your lecture at the Royal Institution,\r\nwhich interested me much, and rather grieved me, for I had hoped things\r\nhad been in a slight degree otherwise. (40/1. \"On certain Zoological\r\nArguments commonly adduced in favour of the hypothesis of the\r\nProgressive Development of Animal Life,\" Discourse, Friday, April 20,\r\n1855: \"Proceedings R.I.\" (1855). Published also in \"Huxley's Scientific\r\nMemoirs.\" The lecturer dwelt chiefly on the argument of Agassiz, which\r\nhe summarises as follows: \"Homocercal fishes have in their embryonic\r\nstate heterocercal tails; therefore heterocercality is, so far, a mark\r\nof an embryonic state as compared with homocercality, and the earlier\r\nheterocercal fish are embryonic as compared with the later homocercal.\"\r\nHe shows that facts do not support this view, and concludes generally\r\n\"that there is no real parallel between the successive forms assumed in\r\nthe development of the life of the individual at present and those which\r\nhave appeared at different epochs in the past.\") I heard some time ago\r\nthat before long I might congratulate you on becoming a married man.\r\n(40/2. Mr. Huxley was married July 21st, 1855.) From my own experience\r\nof some fifteen years, I am very sure that there is nothing in this\r\nwide world which more deserves congratulation, and most sincerely and\r\nheartily do I congratulate you, and wish you many years of as much\r\nhappiness as this world can afford.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 41. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(41/1. The following letter illustrates Darwin's work on aberrant\r\ngenera. In the \"Origin,\" Edition I., page 429, he wrote: \"The more\r\naberrant any form is, the greater must be the number of connecting forms\r\nwhich, on my theory, have been exterminated and utterly lost. And we\r\nhave some evidence of aberrant forms having suffered severely from\r\nextinction, for they are generally represented by extremely few species;\r\nand such species as do occur are generally very distinct from each\r\nother, which again implies extinction.\")\r\n\r\nDown, November 15th [1855?].\r\n\r\nIn Schoenherr's Catalogue of Curculionidae (41/2. \"Genera et Species\r\nCurculionidum.\" (C.J. Schoenherr: Paris, 1833-38.)), the 6,717 species\r\nare on an average 10.17 to a genus. Waterhouse (who knows the group\r\nwell, and who has published on fewness of species in aberrant genera)\r\nhas given me a list of 62 aberrant genera, and these have on an average\r\n7.6 species; and if one single genus be removed (and which I cannot yet\r\nbelieve ought to be considered aberrant), then the 61 aberrant genera\r\nwould have only 4.91 species on an average. I tested these results in\r\nanother way. I found in Schoenherr 9 families, including only 11 genera,\r\nand these genera (9 of which were in Waterhouse's list) I found included\r\nonly 3.36 species on an average.\r\n\r\nThis last result led me to Lindley's \"Vegetable Kingdom,\" in which I\r\nfound (excluding thallogens and acrogens) that the genera include each\r\n10.46 species (how near by chance to the Curculionidae), and I find 21\r\norders including single genera, and these 21 genera have on average 7.95\r\nspecies; but if Lindley is right that Erythroxylon (with its 75 species)\r\nought to be amongst the Malpighiads, then the average would be only 4.6\r\nper genus.\r\n\r\nBut here comes, as it appears to me, an odd thing (I hope I shall not\r\nquite weary you out). There are 29 other orders, each with 2 genera,\r\nand these 58 genera have on an average 15.07 species: this great number\r\nbeing owing to the 10 genera in the Smilaceae, Salicaceae (with 220\r\nspecies), Begoniaceae, Balsaminaceae, Grossulariaceae, without which the\r\nremaining 48 genera have on an average only 5.91 species.\r\n\r\nThis case of the orders with only 2 genera, the genera notwithstanding\r\nhaving 15.07 species each, seems to me very perplexing and upsets,\r\nalmost, the conclusion deducible from the orders with single genera.\r\n\r\nI have gone higher, and tested the alliances with 1, 2, and 3 orders;\r\nand in these cases I find both the genera few in each alliance, and the\r\nspecies, less than the average of the whole kingdom, in each genus.\r\n\r\nAll this has amused me, but I daresay you will have a good sneer at me,\r\nand tell me to stick to my barnacles. By the way, you agree with me that\r\nsometimes one gets despondent--for instance, when theory and facts will\r\nnot harmonise; but what appears to me even worse, and makes me despair,\r\nis, when I see from the same great class of facts, men like Barrande\r\ndeduce conclusions, such as his \"Colonies\" (41/3. Lyell briefly refers\r\nto Barrande's Bohemian work in a letter (August 31st, 1856) to Fleming\r\n(\"Life of Sir Charles Lyell,\" II., page 225): \"He explained to me on the\r\nspot his remarkable discovery of a 'colony' of Upper Silurian fossils,\r\n3,400 feet deep, in the midst of the Lower Silurian group. This has made\r\na great noise, but I think I can explain away the supposed anomaly by,\r\netc.\" (See Letter 40, Note.) and his agreement with E. de Beaumont's\r\nlines of Elevation, or such men as Forbes with his Polarity (41/4.\r\nEdward Forbes \"On the Manifestation of Polarity in the Distribution of\r\nOrganised Beings in Time\" (\"Edinburgh New Phil. Journal,\" Volume LVII.,\r\n1854, page 332). The author points out that \"the maximum development\r\nof generic types during the Palaeozoic period was during its earlier\r\nepochs; that during the Neozoic period towards its later periods.\" Thus\r\nthe two periods of activity are conceived to be at the two opposite\r\npoles of a sphere which in some way represents for him the system of\r\nNature.); I have not a doubt that before many months are over I shall\r\nbe longing for the most dishonest species as being more honest than the\r\nhonestest theories. One remark more. If you feel any interest, or can\r\nget any one else to feel any interest on the aberrant genera question,\r\nI should think the most interesting way would be to take aberrant genera\r\nin any great natural family, and test the average number of species to\r\nthe genera in that family.\r\n\r\nHow I wish we lived near each other! I should so like a talk with you on\r\ngeographical distribution, taken in its greatest features. I have been\r\ntrying from land productions to take a very general view of the world,\r\nand I should so like to see how far it agrees with plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 42. TO MRS. LYELL.\r\n\r\n(42/1. Mrs. Lyell is a daughter of the late Mr. Leonard Horner, and\r\nwidow of Lieut.-Col. Lyell, a brother of Sir Charles.)\r\n\r\nDown, January 26th [1856].\r\n\r\nI shall be very glad to be of any sort of use to you in regard to the\r\nbeetles. But first let me thank you for your kind note and offer of\r\nspecimens to my children. My boys are all butterfly hunters; and all\r\nyoung and ardent lepidopterists despise, from the bottom of their souls,\r\ncoleopterists.\r\n\r\nThe simplest plan for your end and for the good of entomology, I should\r\nthink, would be to offer the collection to Dr. J.E. Gray for the British\r\nMuseum on condition that a perfect set was made out for you. If the\r\ncollection was at all valuable, I should think he would be very glad to\r\nhave this done. Whether any third set would be worth making out would\r\ndepend on the value of the collection. I do not suppose that you expect\r\nthe insects to be named, for that would be a most serious labour. If you\r\ndo not approve of this scheme, I should think it very likely that Mr.\r\nWaterhouse would think it worth his while to set a series for you,\r\nretaining duplicates for himself; but I say this only on a venture.\r\nYou might trust Mr. Waterhouse implicitly, which I fear, as [illegible]\r\ngoes, is more than can be said for all entomologists. I presume, if\r\nyou thought of either scheme, Sir Charles Lyell could easily see the\r\ngentlemen and arrange it; but, if not, I could do so when next I come to\r\ntown, which, however, will not be for three or four weeks.\r\n\r\nWith respect to giving your children a taste for Natural History, I will\r\nventure one remark--viz., that giving them specimens in my opinion would\r\ntend to destroy such taste. Youngsters must be themselves collectors\r\nto acquire a taste; and if I had a collection of English lepidoptera, I\r\nwould be systematically most miserly, and not give my boys half a dozen\r\nbutterflies in the year. Your eldest has the brow of an observer, if\r\nthere be the least truth in phrenology. We are all better, but we have\r\nbeen of late a poor household.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 43. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1855].\r\n\r\nI should have less scruple in troubling you if I had any confidence\r\nwhat my work would turn out. Sometimes I think it will be good, at\r\nother times I really feel as much ashamed of myself as the author of the\r\n\"Vestiges\" ought to be of himself. I know well that your kindness and\r\nfriendship would make you do a great deal for me, but that is no reason\r\nthat I should be unreasonable. I cannot and ought not to forget that all\r\nyour time is employed in work certain to be valuable. It is superfluous\r\nin me to say that I enjoy exceedingly writing to you, and that your\r\nanswers are of the greatest possible service to me. I return with\r\nmany thanks the proof on Aquilegia (43/1. This seems to refer to\r\nthe discussion on the genus Aquilegia in Hooker and Thomson's \"Flora\r\nIndica,\" 1855, Volume I., Systematic Part, page 44. The authors'\r\nconclusion is that \"all the European and many of the Siberian forms\r\ngenerally recognised belong to one very variable species.\" With regard\r\nto cirripedes, Mr. Darwin spoke of \"certain just perceptible differences\r\nwhich blend together and constitute varieties and not species\" (\"Life\r\nand Letters,\" I., page 379).): it has interested me much. It is exactly\r\nlike my barnacles; but for my particular purpose, most unfortunately,\r\nboth Kolreuter and Gartner have worked chiefly on A. vulgaris and\r\ncanadensis and atro-purpurea, and these are just the species that you\r\nseem not to have studied. N.B. Why do you not let me buy the Indian\r\nFlora? You are too magnificent.\r\n\r\nNow for a short ride on my chief (at present) hobbyhorse, viz. aberrant\r\ngenera. What you say under your remarks on Lepidodendron seems just the\r\ncase that I want, to give some sort of evidence of what we both believe\r\nin, viz. how groups came to be anomalous or aberrant; and I think some\r\nsort of proof is required, for I do not believe very many naturalists\r\nwould at all admit our view.\r\n\r\nThank you for the caution on large anomalous genera first catching\r\nattention. I do not quite agree with your \"grave objection to the whole\r\nprocess,\" which is \"that if you multiply the anomalous species by 100,\r\nand divide the normal by the same, you will then reverse the names...\"\r\nFor, to take an example, Ornithorhynchus and Echidna would not be less\r\naberrant if each had a dozen (I do not say 100, because we have no such\r\ncases in the animal kingdom) species instead of one. What would really\r\nmake these two genera less anomalous would be the creation of many\r\ngenera and sub-families round and radiating from them on all sides.\r\nThus if Australia were destroyed, Didelphys in S. America would be\r\nwonderfully anomalous (this is your case with Proteaceae), whereas now\r\nthere are so many genera and little sub-families of Marsupiata that the\r\ngroup cannot be called aberrant or anomalous. Sagitta (and the earwig)\r\nis one of the most anomalous animals in the world, and not a bit the\r\nless because there are a dozen species. Now, my point (which, I think is\r\na slightly new point of view) is, if it is extinction which has made the\r\ngenus anomalous, as a general rule the same causes of extinction would\r\nallow the existence of only a few species in such genera. Whenever we\r\nmeet (which will be on the 23rd [at the] Club) I shall much like to hear\r\nwhether this strikes you as sound. I feel all the time on the borders of\r\na circle of truism. Of course I could not think of such a request,\r\nbut you might possibly:--if Bentham does not think the whole subject\r\nrubbish, ask him some time to pick out the dozen most anomalous genera\r\nin the Leguminosae, or any great order of which there is a monograph by\r\nwhich I could calculate the ordinary percentage of species to genera. I\r\nam the more anxious, as the more I enquire, the fewer are the cases\r\nin which it can be done. It cannot be done in birds, or, I fear, in\r\nmammifers. I doubt much whether in any other class of insects [other\r\nthan Curculionidae].\r\n\r\nI saw your nice notice of poor Forbes in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\"\r\nand I see in the \"Athenaeum\" a notice of meeting on last Saturday of his\r\nfriends. Of course I shall wish to subscribe as soon as possible to any\r\nmemorial...\r\n\r\nI have just been testing practically what disuse does in reducing\r\nparts. I have made [skeletons] of wild and tame duck (oh the smell of\r\nwell-boiled, high duck!), and I find the tame duck ought, according to\r\nscale of wild prototype, to have its two wings 360 grains in weight; but\r\nit has only 317, or 43 grains too little, or 1/7 of [its] own two wings\r\ntoo little in weight. This seems rather interesting to me. (43/2. On\r\nthe conclusions drawn from these researches, see Mr. Platt Ball, \"The\r\nEffects of Use and Disuse\" (Nature Series), 1890, page 55. With regard\r\nto his pigeons, Darwin wrote, in November 1855: \"I love them to that\r\nextent that I cannot bear to kill and skeletonise them.\")\r\n\r\nP.S.--I do not know whether you will think this worth reading over. I\r\nhave worked it out since writing my letter, and tabulate the whole.\r\n\r\n21 orders with 1 genus, having 7.95 species (or 4.6?).\r\n\r\n29 orders with 2 genera, having 15.05 species on an average.\r\n\r\n23 orders each with 3 genera, and these genera include on an average 8.2\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n20 orders each with 4 genera, and these genera include on an average\r\n12.2 species.\r\n\r\n27 orders each with above 50 genera (altogether 4716 genera), and these\r\ngenera on an average have 9.97 species.\r\n\r\nFrom this I conclude, whether there be many or few genera in an order,\r\nthe number of species in a genus is not much affected; but perhaps when\r\n[there is] only one genus in an order it will be affected, and this will\r\ndepend whether the [genus] Erythroxylon be made a family of.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 44. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 8th [1856].\r\n\r\nI have been particularly glad to get your splendid eloge of Lindley. His\r\nname had been lately passing through my head, and I had hoped that Miers\r\nwould have proposed him for the Royal medal. I most entirely agree that\r\nthe Copley (44/1. The late Professor Lindley never attained the honour\r\nof the Copley medal. The Royal medal was awarded to him in 1857.) is\r\nmore appropriate, and I daresay he would not have valued the Royal. From\r\nskimming through many botanical books, and from often consulting the\r\n\"Vegetable Kingdom,\" I had (ignorant as I am) formed the highest opinion\r\nof his claims as a botanist. If Sharpey will stick up strong for him,\r\nwe should have some chance; but the natural sciences are but feebly\r\nrepresented in the Council. Sir P. Egerton, I daresay, would be strong\r\nfor him. You know Bell is out. Now, my only doubt is, and I hope that\r\nyou will consider this, that the natural sciences being weak on the\r\nCouncil, and (I fancy) the most powerful man in the Council, Col.\r\nS[abine], being strong against Lindley, whether we should have any\r\nchance of succeeding. It would be so easy to name some eminent man whose\r\nname would be well-known to all the physicists. Would Lindley hear of\r\nand dislike being proposed for the Copley and not succeeding? Would it\r\nnot be better on this view to propose him for the Royal? Do think of\r\nthis. Moreover, if Lindley is not proposed for the Royal, I fear both\r\nRoyal medals would go [to] physicists; for I, for one, should not like\r\nto propose another zoologist, though Hancock would be a very good man,\r\nand I fancy there would be a feeling against medals to two botanists.\r\nBut for whatever Lindley is proposed, I will do my best. We will talk\r\nthis over here.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 45. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 9th [1856].\r\n\r\n...With respect to Huxley, I was on the point of speaking to Crawford\r\nand Strezlecki (who will be on Committee of the Athenaeum) when I\r\nbethought me of how Owen would look and what he would say. Cannot you\r\nfancy him, with slow and gentle voice, asking \"Will Mr. Crawford tell\r\nme what Mr. Huxley has done, deserving this honour; I only know that\r\nhe differs from, and disputes the authority of Cuvier, Ehrenberg, and\r\nAgassiz as of no weight at all.\" And when I began to tell Mr. Crawford\r\nwhat to say, I was puzzled, and could refer him only to some excellent\r\npapers in the \"Phil. Trans.\" for which the medal had been awarded. But\r\nI doubt, with an opposing faction, whether this would be considered\r\nenough, for I believe real scientific merit is not thought enough,\r\nwithout the person is generally well known. Now I want to hear what you\r\ndeliberately think on this head: it would be bad to get him proposed and\r\nthen rejected; and Owen is very powerful.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 46. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1856].\r\n\r\nI have got the Lectures, and have read them. (46/1. The reference is\r\npresumably to the Royal Institution Lectures given in 1854-56. Those\r\nwhich we have seen--namely, those reprinted in the \"Scientific Memoirs,\"\r\nVolume I.--\"On the Common Plan of Animal Form,\" page 281; \"On certain\r\nZoological Arguments, etc.\" page 300; \"On Natural History as Knowledge,\r\nDiscipline, and Power,\" page 305, do not seem to us to contain anything\r\nlikely to offend; but Falconer's attack in the \"Ann. and Mag. of Nat.\r\nHist.\" June 1856, on the last-named lecture, shows strong feeling. A\r\nreply by Mr. Huxley appeared in the July number of the same Journal. The\r\nmost heretical discussion from a modern standpoint is at page 311, where\r\nhe asks how it is conceivable that the bright colours of butterflies and\r\nshells or the elegant forms of Foraminifera can possibly be of service\r\nto their possessors; and it is this which especially struck Darwin,\r\njudging by the pencil notes on his copy of the Lecture.) Though I\r\nbelieve, as far as my knowledge goes, that Huxley is right, yet I think\r\nhis tone very much too vehement, and I have ventured to say so in a\r\nnote to Huxley. I had not thought of these lectures in relation to the\r\nAthenaeum (46/2. Mr. Huxley was in 1858 elected to the Athenaeum Club\r\nunder Rule 2, which provides for the annual election of \"a certain\r\nnumber of persons of distinguished eminence in science, literature, or\r\nthe arts, or for public services.\"), but I am inclined quite to agree\r\nwith you, and that we had better pause before anything is said...(N.B.\r\nI found Falconer very indignant at the manner in which Huxley treated\r\nCuvier in his Royal Institution lectures; and I have gently told Huxley\r\nso.) I think we had better do nothing: to try in earnest to get a great\r\nnaturalist into the Athenaeum and fail, is far worse than doing nothing.\r\n\r\nHow strange, funny, and disgraceful that nearly all (Faraday and Sir J.\r\nHerschel at least exceptions) our great men are in quarrels in couplets;\r\nit never struck me before...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 47. C. LYELL TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(47/1. In the \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 72, is given a letter (June\r\n16th, 1856) to Lyell, in which Darwin exhales his indignation over\r\nthe \"extensionists\" who created continents ad libitum to suit the\r\nconvenience of their theories. On page 74 a fuller statement of his\r\nviews is given in a letter dated June 25th. We have not seen Lyell's\r\nreply to this, but his reply to Darwin's letter of June 16th is extant,\r\nand is here printed for the first time.)\r\n\r\n53, Harley Street, London, June 17th, 1856.\r\n\r\nI wonder you did not also mention D. Sharpe's paper (47/2. \"On the Last\r\nElevation of the Alps, etc.\" (\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XII.,\r\n1856, page 102.), just published, by which the Alps were submerged\r\nas far as 9,000 feet of their present elevation above the sea in the\r\nGlacial period and then since uplifted again. Without admitting this,\r\nyou would probably convey the alpine boulders to the Jura by marine\r\ncurrents, and if so, make the Alps and Jura islands in the glacial sea.\r\nAnd would not the Glacial theory, as now very generally understood,\r\nimmerse as much of Europe as I did in my original map of Europe, when I\r\nsimply expressed all the area which at some time or other had been under\r\nwater since the commencement of the Eocene period? I almost suspect the\r\nglacial submergence would exceed it.\r\n\r\nBut would not this be a measure of the movement in every other\r\narea, northern (arctic), antarctic, or tropical, during an equal\r\nperiod--oceanic or continental? For the conversion of sea into land\r\nwould always equal the turning of much land into sea.\r\n\r\nBut all this would be done in a fraction of the Pliocene period; the\r\nGlacial shells are barely 1 per cent. extinct species. Multiply this by\r\nthe older Pliocene and Miocene epochs.\r\n\r\nYou also forget an author who, by means of atolls, contrived to submerge\r\narchipelagoes (or continents?), the mountains of which must originally\r\nhave differed from each other in height 8,000 (or 10,000?) feet, so\r\nthat they all just rose to the surface at one level, or their sites are\r\nmarked by buoys of coral. I could never feel sure whether he meant\r\nthis tremendous catastrophe, all brought about by what Sedgwick called\r\n\"Lyell's niggling operations,\" to have been effected during the era of\r\nexisting species of corals. Perhaps you can tell me, for I am really\r\ncurious to know...(47/3. The author referred to is of course Darwin.)\r\n\r\nNow, although there is nothing in my works to warrant the building up\r\nof continents in the Atlantic and Pacific even since the Eocene period,\r\nyet, as some of the rocks in the central Alps are in part Eocene, I\r\nbegin to think that all continents and oceans may be chiefly, if not\r\nall, post-Eocene, and Dana's \"Atlantic Ocean\" of the Lower Silurian is\r\nchildish (see the Anniversary Address, 1856). (47/4. Probably Dana's\r\nAnniversary Address to the \"American Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience,\" published in the \"Proceedings\" 1856.) But how far you are at\r\nliberty to call up continents from \"the vasty deep\" as often as you\r\nwant to convey a Helix from the United States to Europe in Miocene or\r\nPliocene periods is a question; for the ocean is getting deeper of late,\r\nand Haughton says the mean depth is eleven miles! by his late paper\r\non tides. (47/5. \"On the Depth of the Sea deducible from Tidal\r\nObservations\" (\"Proc. Irish Acad.\" Volume VI., page 354, 1853-54).) I\r\nshall be surprised if this turns out true by soundings.\r\n\r\nI thought your mind was expanding so much in regard to time that\r\nyou would have been going ahead in regard to the possibility of\r\nmountain-chains being created in a fraction of the period required to\r\nconvert a swan into a goose, or vice versa. Nine feet did the Rimutaka\r\nchain of New Zealand gain in height in January, 1855, and a great\r\nearthquake has occurred in New Zealand every seven years for half\r\na century nearly. The \"Washingtonia\" (Californian conifer) (47/6.\r\nWashingtonia, or Wellingtonia, better known as Sequoia. Asa Gray,\r\nwriting in 1872, states his belief that \"no Sequoia now alive can\r\nsensibly antedate the Christian era\" (\"Scientific Papers,\" II., page\r\n144).) lately exhibited was four thousand years old, so that one\r\nindividual might see a chain of hills rise, and rise with it, much\r\n[more] a species--and those islands which J. Hooker describes as covered\r\nwith New Zealand plants three hundred (?) miles to the N.E. (?) of New\r\nZealand may have been separated from the mainland two or three or four\r\ngenerations of Washingtonia ago.\r\n\r\nIf the identity of the land-shells of all the hundreds of British Isles\r\nbe owing to their having been united since the Glacial period, and the\r\ndiscordance, almost total, of the shells of Porto Santo and Madeira be\r\nowing to their having been separated [during] all the newer and possibly\r\nolder Pliocene periods, then it gives us a conception of time which will\r\naid you much in your conversion of species, if immensity of time will do\r\nall you require; for the Glacial period is thus shown, as we might have\r\nanticipated, to be contemptible in duration or in distance from us,\r\nas compared to the older Pliocene, let alone the Miocene, when our\r\ncontemporary species were, though in a minority, already beginning to\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\nThe littoral shells, according to MacAndrew, imply that Madeira and the\r\nCanaries were once joined to the mainland of Europe or Africa, but that\r\nthose isles were disjoined so long ago that most of the species came\r\nin since. In short, the marine shells tell the same story as the land\r\nshells. Why do the plants of Porto Santo and Madeira agree so nearly?\r\nAnd why do the shells which are the same as European or African species\r\nremain quite unaltered, like the Crag species, which returned unchanged\r\nto the British seas after being expelled from them by glacial cold,\r\nwhen two millions (?) of years had elapsed, and after such migration to\r\nmilder seas? Be so good as to explain all this in your next letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 48. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, July 5th [1856].\r\n\r\nI write this morning in great tribulation about Tristan d'Acunha. (48/1.\r\nSee \"Flora Antarctica,\" page 216. Though Tristan d'Acunha is \"only 1,000\r\nmiles distant from the Cape of Good Hope, and 3,000 from the Strait of\r\nMagalhaens, the botany of this island is far more intimately allied to\r\nthat of Fuegia than Africa.\") The more I reflect on your Antarctic flora\r\nthe more I am astounded. You give all the facts so clearly and fully,\r\nthat it is impossible to help speculating on the subject; but it drives\r\nme to despair, for I cannot gulp down your continent; and not being able\r\nto do so gives, in my eyes, the multiple creationists an awful triumph.\r\nIt is a wondrous case, and how strange that A. De Candolle should have\r\nignored it; which he certainly has, as it seems to me. I wrote Lyell a\r\nlong geological letter (48/2. \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 74.) about\r\ncontinents, and I have had a very long and interesting answer; but\r\nI cannot in the least gather his opinion about all your continental\r\nextensionists; and I have written again beseeching a verdict. (48/3.\r\nIn the tenth edition of the \"Principles,\" 1872, Lyell added a chapter\r\n(Chapter XLI., page 406) on insular floras and faunas in relation to the\r\norigin of species; he here (page 410) gives his reasons against Forbes\r\nas an extensionist.) I asked him to send to you my letter, for as it\r\nwas well copied it would not be troublesome to read; but whether worth\r\nreading I really do not know; I have given in it the reasons which make\r\nme strongly opposed to continental extensions.\r\n\r\nI was very glad to get your note some days ago: I wish you would think\r\nit worth while, as you intend to have the Laburnum case translated, to\r\nwrite to \"Wien\" (that unknown place) (48/4. There is a tradition that\r\nDarwin once asked Hooker where \"this place Wien is, where they publish\r\nso many books.\"), and find out how the Laburnum has been behaving: it\r\nreally ought to be known.\r\n\r\nThe Entada is a beast. (48/5. The large seeds of Entada scandens are\r\noccasionally floated across the Atlantic and cast on the shores of\r\nEurope.); I have never differed from you about the growth of a plant in\r\na new island being a FAR harder trial than transportal, though certainly\r\nthat seems hard enough. Indeed I suspect I go even further than you in\r\nthis respect; but it is too long a story.\r\n\r\nThank you for the Aristolochia and Viscum cases: what species were\r\nthey? I ask, because oddly these two very genera I have seen advanced\r\nas instances (I forget at present by whom, but by good men) in which\r\nthe agency of insects was absolutely necessary for impregnation. In\r\nour British dioecious Viscum I suppose it must be necessary. Was there\r\nanything to show that the stigma was ready for pollen in these two\r\ncases? for it seems that there are many cases in which pollen is shed\r\nlong before the stigma is ready. As in our Viscum, insects carry,\r\nsufficiently regularly for impregnation, pollen from flower to flower,\r\nI should think that there must be occasional crosses even in an\r\nhermaphrodite Viscum. I have never heard of bees and butterflies, only\r\nmoths, producing fertile eggs without copulation.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Ray Society, I profited so enormously by its\r\npublishing my Cirrepedia, that I cannot quite agree with you on\r\nconfining it to translations; I know not how else I could possibly have\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nI have just sent in my name for 20 pounds to the Linnaean Society, but\r\nI must confess I have done it with heavy groans, whereas I daresay you\r\ngave your 20 pounds like a light-hearted gentleman...\r\n\r\nP.S. Wollaston speaks strongly about the intermediate grade between\r\ntwo varieties in insects and mollusca being often rarer than the two\r\nvarieties themselves. This is obviously very important for me, and\r\nnot easy to explain. I believe I have had cases from you. But, if you\r\nbelieve in this, I wish you would give me a sentence to quote from\r\nyou on this head. There must, I think, be a good deal of truth in it;\r\notherwise there could hardly be nearly distinct varieties under any\r\nspecies, for we should have instead a blending series, as in brambles\r\nand willows.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 49. TO J.D. HOOKER. July 13th, 1856.\r\n\r\nWhat a book a devil's chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful,\r\nblundering, low, and horribly cruel works of nature! With respect to\r\ncrossing, from one sentence in your letter I think you misunderstand me.\r\nI am very far from believing in hybrids: only in crossing of the same\r\nspecies or of close varieties. These two or three last days I have been\r\nobserving wheat, and have convinced myself that L. Deslongchamps is\r\nin error about impregnation taking place in closed flowers; i.e., of\r\ncourse, I can judge only from external appearances. By the way, R. Brown\r\nonce told me that the use of the brush on stigma of grasses was unknown.\r\nDo you know its use?...\r\n\r\nYou say most truly about multiple creations and my notions. If any one\r\ncase could be proved, I should be smashed; but as I am writing my book,\r\nI try to take as much pains as possible to give the strongest cases\r\nopposed to me, and often such conjectures as occur to me. I have been\r\nworking your books as the richest (and vilest) mine against me; and\r\nwhat hard work I have had to get up your New Zealand Flora! As I have\r\nto quote you so often, I should like to refer to Muller's case of\r\nthe Australian Alps. Where is it published? Is it a book? A correct\r\nreference would be enough for me, though it is wrong even to quote\r\nwithout looking oneself. I should like to see very much Forbes's sheets,\r\nwhich you refer to; but I must confess (I hardly know why) I have got\r\nrather to mistrust poor dear Forbes.\r\n\r\nThere is wonderful ill logic in his famous and admirable memoir on\r\ndistribution, as it appears to me, now that I have got it up so as to\r\ngive the heads in a page. Depend on it, my saying is a true one--viz.\r\nthat a compiler is a great man, and an original man a commonplace man.\r\nAny fool can generalise and speculate; but oh, my heavens, to get up at\r\nsecond hand a New Zealand Flora, that is work...\r\n\r\nAnd now I am going to beg almost as great a favour as a man can beg of\r\nanother: and I ask some five or six weeks before I want the favour done,\r\nthat it may appear less horrid. It is to read, but well copied out, my\r\npages (about forty!!) on Alpine floras and faunas, Arctic and Antarctic\r\nfloras and faunas, and the supposed cold mundane period. It would be\r\nreally an enormous advantage to me, as I am sure otherwise to make\r\nbotanical blunders. I would specify the few points on which I most want\r\nyour advice. But it is quite likely that you may object on the ground\r\nthat you might be publishing before me (I hope to publish in a year at\r\nfurthest), so that it would hamper and bother you; and secondly you may\r\nobject to the loss of time, for I daresay it would take an hour and a\r\nhalf to read. It certainly would be of immense advantage to me; but of\r\ncourse you must not think of doing it if it would interfere with your\r\nown work.\r\n\r\nI do not consider this request in futuro as breaking my promise to give\r\nno more trouble for some time.\r\n\r\nFrom Lyell's letters, he is coming round at a railway pace on the\r\nmutability of species, and authorises me to put some sentences on this\r\nhead in my preface.\r\n\r\nI shall meet Lyell on Wednesday at Lord Stanhope's, and will ask him to\r\nforward my letter to you; though, as my arguments have not struck him,\r\nthey cannot have force, and my head must be crotchety on the subject;\r\nbut the crotchets keep firmly there. I have given your opinion on\r\ncontinuous land, I see, too strongly.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 50. TO S.P. WOODWARD. Down, July 18th [1856].\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for your kindness in writing to me at such length, and\r\nI am glad to say for your sake that I do not see that I shall have to\r\nbeg any further favours. What a range and what a variability in the\r\nCyrena! (50/1. A genus of Lamellibranchs ranging from the Lias to the\r\npresent day.) Your list of the ranges of the land and fresh-water shells\r\ncertainly is most striking and curious, and especially as the antiquity\r\nof four of them is so clearly shown.\r\n\r\nI have got Harvey's seaside book, and liked it; I was not particularly\r\nstruck with it, but I will re-read the first and last chapters.\r\n\r\nI am growing as bad as the worst about species, and hardly have a\r\nvestige of belief in the permanence of species left in me; and this\r\nconfession will make you think very lightly of me, but I cannot help\r\nit. Such has become my honest conviction, though the difficulties and\r\narguments against such heresy are certainly most weighty.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 51. TO C. LYELL. November 10th [1856].\r\n\r\nI know you like all cases of negative geological evidence being upset.\r\nI fancied that I was a most unwilling believer in negative evidence; but\r\nyet such negative evidence did seem to me so strong that in my \"Fossil\r\nLepadidae\" I have stated, giving reasons, that I did not believe there\r\ncould have existed any sessile cirripedes during the Secondary ages.\r\nNow, the other day Bosquet of Maestricht sends me a perfect drawing of a\r\nperfect Chthamalus (a recent genus) from the Chalk! (51/1. Chthamalus,\r\na genus of Cirripedia. (\"A Monograph on the Sub-class Cirripedia,\" by\r\nCharles Darwin, page 447. London, 1854.) A fossil species of this genus\r\nof Upper Cretaceous age was named by Bosquet Chthamalus Darwini. See\r\n\"Origin,\" Edition VI., page 284; also Zittel, \"Traite de Paleontologie,\"\r\nTraduit par Dr. C. Barrois, Volume II., page 540, figure 748. Paris,\r\n1887.) Indeed, it is stretching a point to make it specifically distinct\r\nfrom our living British species. It is a genus not hitherto found in any\r\nTertiary bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 52. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, July 9th, 1857.\r\n\r\nI am extremely much obliged to you for having so fully entered on my\r\npoint. I knew I was on unsafe ground, but it proves far unsafer than I\r\nhad thought. I had thought that Brulle (52/1. This no doubt refers to A.\r\nBrulle's paper in the \"Comptes rendus\" 1844, of which a translation is\r\ngiven in the \"Annals and Mag. of Natural History,\" 1844, page 484. In\r\nspeaking of the development of the Articulata, the author says \"that the\r\nappendages are manifested at an earlier period of the existence of an\r\nArticulate animal the more complex its degree of organisation, and vice\r\nversa that they make their appearance the later, the fewer the number\r\nof transformations which it has to undergo.\") had a wider basis for his\r\ngeneralisation, for I made the extract several years ago, and I\r\npresume (I state it as some excuse for myself) that I doubted it, for,\r\ndifferently from my general habit, I have not extracted his grounds.\r\nIt was meeting with Barneoud's paper which made me think there might be\r\ntruth in the doctrine. (52/2. Apparently Barneoud \"On the Organogeny\r\nof Irregular Corollas,\" from the \"Comptes rendus,\" 1847, as given in\r\n\"Annals and Mag. of Natural History,\" 1847, page 440. The paper chiefly\r\ndeals with the fact that in their earliest condition irregular flowers\r\nare regular. The view attributed to Barneoud does not seem so definitely\r\ngiven in this paper as in a previous one (\"Ann. Sc. Nat.\" Bot., Tom.\r\nVI., page 268.) Your instance of heart and brain of fish seems to me\r\nvery good. It was a very stupid blunder on my part not thinking of\r\nthe posterior part of the time of development. I shall, of course, not\r\nallude to this subject, which I rather grieve about, as I wished it\r\nto be true; but, alas! a scientific man ought to have no wishes, no\r\naffections--a mere heart of stone.\r\n\r\nThere is only one point in your letter which at present I cannot quite\r\nfollow you in: supposing that Barneoud's (I do not say Brulle's) remarks\r\nwere true and universal--i.e., that the petals which have to undergo\r\nthe greatest amount of development and modification begin to change the\r\nsoonest from the simple and common embryonic form of the petal--if this\r\nwere a true law, then I cannot but think that it would throw light on\r\nMilne Edwards' proposition that the wider apart the classes of animals\r\nare, the sooner do they diverge from the common embryonic plan--which\r\ncommon embryonic [plan] may be compared with the similar petals in\r\nthe early bud, the several petals in one flower being compared to the\r\ndistinct but similar embryos of the different classes. I much wish that\r\nyou would so far keep this in mind, that whenever we meet I might hear\r\nhow far you differ or concur in this. I have always looked at Barneoud's\r\nand Brulle's proposition as only in some degree analogous.\r\n\r\nP.S. I see in my abstract of Milne Edwards' paper, he speaks of \"the\r\nmost perfect and important organs\" as being first developed, and I\r\nshould have thought that this was usually synonymous with the most\r\ndeveloped or modified.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 53. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(53/1. The following letter is chiefly of interest as showing the amount\r\nand kind of work required for Darwin's conclusions on \"large genera\r\nvarying,\" which occupy no more than two or three pages in the \"Origin\"\r\n(Edition I., page 55). Some correspondence on the subject is given in\r\nthe \"Life and Letters,\" II., pages 102-5.)\r\n\r\nDown, August 22nd [1857].\r\n\r\nYour handwriting always rejoices the cockles of my heart; though you\r\nhave no reason to be \"overwhelmed with shame,\" as I did not expect to\r\nhear.\r\n\r\nI write now chiefly to know whether you can tell me how to write to\r\nHermann Schlagenheit (is this spelt right?) (53/2. Schlagintweit.), for\r\nI believe he is returned to England, and he has poultry skins for me\r\nfrom W. Elliot of Madras.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear that you have been tabulating some Floras about\r\nvarieties. Will you just tell me roughly the result? Do you not find it\r\ntakes much time? I am employing a laboriously careful schoolmaster, who\r\ndoes the tabulating and dividing into two great cohorts, more carefully\r\nthan I can. This being so, I should be very glad some time to have Koch,\r\nWebb's Canaries, and Ledebour, and Grisebach, but I do not know even\r\nwhere Rumelia is. I shall work the British flora with three separate\r\nFloras; and I intend dividing the varieties into two classes, as Asa\r\nGray and Henslow give the materials, and, further, A. Gray and H.C.\r\nWatson have marked for me the forms, which they consider real species,\r\nbut yet are very close to others; and it will be curious to compare\r\nresults. If it will all hold good it is very important for me; for it\r\nexplains, as I think, all classification, i.e. the quasi-branching and\r\nsub-branching of forms, as if from one root, big genera increasing and\r\nsplitting up, etc., as you will perceive. But then comes in, also, what\r\nI call a principle of divergence, which I think I can explain, but which\r\nis too long, and perhaps you would not care to hear. As you have been on\r\nthis subject, you might like to hear what very little is complete (for\r\nmy schoolmaster has had three weeks' holidays)--only three cases as yet,\r\nI see.\r\n\r\n   BABINGTON--British Flora.\r\n\r\n   593 species in genera of 5 and   593 (odd chance equal) in\r\n   upwards have in a thousand       genera of 3 and downwards have\r\n   species presenting vars.         in a thousand presenting vars.\r\n   134/1000.*                       37/1000.\r\n\r\n   (*53/3.  This sentence may be interpreted as follows:  The number of\r\n   species which present varieties are 134 per thousand in genera of 5 species\r\n   and upwards.  The result is obtained from tabulation of 593 species.)\r\n\r\n   HOOKER--New Zealand.\r\n\r\n   Genera with 4 species and        With 3 species and downwards\r\n   upwards, 150/1000.               114/1000.\r\n\r\n   GODRON--Central France.\r\n\r\n   With 5 species and upwards       With 3 species and downwards\r\n   160/1000.                        105/1000.\r\n\r\nI do not enter into details on omitting introduced plants and very\r\nvarying genera, as Rubus, Salix, Rosa, etc., which would make the result\r\nmore in favour.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed seeing Henslow extremely, though I was a good way from well at\r\nthe time. Farewell, my dear Hooker: do not forget your visit here some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 54. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 14th [1857].\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday I will send off from London, whither I go on that day,\r\nLedebour's three remaining volumes, Grisebach and Cybele, i.e., all that\r\nI have, and most truly am I obliged to you for them. I find the rule, as\r\nyet, of the species varying most in the large genera universal, except\r\nin Miquel's very brief and therefore imperfect list of the Holland\r\nflora, which makes me very anxious to tabulate a fuller flora of\r\nHolland. I shall remain in London till Friday morning, and if quite\r\nconvenient to send me two volumes of D.C. Prodromus, I could take them\r\nhome and tabulate them. I should think a volume with a large best known\r\nnatural family, and a volume with several small broken families would\r\nbe best, always supposing that the varieties are conspicuously marked in\r\nboth. Have you the volume published by Lowe on Madeira? If so and if any\r\nvarieties are marked I should much like to see it, to see if I can make\r\nout anything about habitats of vars. in so small an area--a point on\r\nwhich I have become very curious. I fear there is no chance of your\r\npossessing Forbes and Hancock \"British Shells,\" a grand work, which I\r\nmuch wish to tabulate.\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for seed of Adlumia cirrhosa, which I will carefully\r\nobserve. My notice in the G. Ch. on Kidney Beans (54.1 \"On the Agency\r\nof Bees in the Fertilisation of Papilionaceous Flowers\" (\"Gardeners'\r\nChronicle,\" 1857, page 725).) has brought me a curious letter from an\r\nintelligent gardener, with a most remarkable lot of beans, crossed in a\r\nmarvellous manner IN THE FIRST GENERATION, like the peas sent to you by\r\nBerkeley and like those experimentalised on by Gartner and by Wiegmann.\r\nIt is a very odd case; I shall sow these seeds and see what comes up.\r\nHow very odd that pollen of one form should affect the outer coats and\r\nsize of the bean produced by pure species!...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 55. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1857?].\r\n\r\nYou know how I work subjects: namely, if I stumble on any general\r\nremark, and if I find it confirmed in any other very distinct class,\r\nthen I try to find out whether it is true,--if it has any bearing on my\r\nwork. The following, perhaps, may be important to me. Dr. Wight remarks\r\nthat Cucurbitaceae (55/1. Wight, \"Remarks on the Fruit of the Natural\r\nOrder Cucurbitaceae\" (\"Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.\" VIII., page 261). R. Wight,\r\nF.R.S. (1796-1872) was Superintendent of the Madras Botanic Garden.)\r\nis a very isolated family, and has very diverging affinities. I find,\r\nstrongly put and illustrated, the very same remark in the genera of\r\nhymenoptera. Now, it is not to me at first apparent why a very distinct\r\nand isolated group should be apt to have more divergent affinities than\r\na less isolated group. I am aware that most genera have more affinities\r\nthan in two ways, which latter, perhaps, is the commonest case. I see\r\nhow infinitely vague all this is; but I should very much like to know\r\nwhat you and Mr. Bentham (if he will read this), who have attended so\r\nmuch to the principles of classification, think of this. Perhaps the\r\nbest way would be to think of half a dozen most isolated groups of\r\nplants, and then consider whether the affinities point in an unusual\r\nnumber of directions. Very likely you may think the whole question too\r\nvague to be worth consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 56. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 8th [1857].\r\n\r\nI now want to ask your opinion, and for facts on a point; and as I shall\r\noften want to do this during the next year or two, so let me say, once\r\nfor all, that you must not take trouble out of mere good nature (of\r\nwhich towards me you have a most abundant stock), but you must consider,\r\nin regard to the trouble any question may take, whether you think it\r\nworth while--as all loss of time so far lessens your original work--to\r\ngive me facts to be quoted on your authority in my work. Do not think\r\nI shall be disappointed if you cannot spare time; for already I have\r\nprofited enormously from your judgment and knowledge. I earnestly beg\r\nyou to act as I suggest, and not take trouble solely out of good-nature.\r\n\r\nMy point is as follows: Harvey gives the case of Fucus varying\r\nremarkably, and yet in same way under most different conditions. D. Don\r\nmakes same remark in regard to Juncus bufonius in England and India.\r\nPolygala vulgaris has white, red, and blue flowers in Faroe, England,\r\nand I think Herbert says in Zante. Now such cases seem to me very\r\nstriking, as showing how little relation some variations have to\r\nclimatal conditions.\r\n\r\nDo you think there are many such cases? Does Oxalis corniculata present\r\nexactly the same varieties under very different climates?\r\n\r\nHow is it with any other British plants in New Zealand, or at the foot\r\nof the Himalaya? Will you think over this and let me hear the result?\r\n\r\nOne other question: do you remember whether the introduced Sonchus in\r\nNew Zealand was less, equally, or more common than the aboriginal stock\r\nof the same species, where both occurred together? I forget whether\r\nthere is any other case parallel with this curious one of the Sonchus...\r\n\r\nI have been making good, though slow, progress with my book, for facts\r\nhave been falling nicely into groups, enlightening each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 57. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Moor Park, Farnham, Surrey [1857?].\r\n\r\nYour letter has been forwarded to me here, where I am profiting by a\r\nfew weeks' rest and hydropathy. Your letter has interested and amused me\r\nmuch. I am extremely glad you have taken up the Aphis (57/1. Professor\r\nHuxley's paper on the organic reproduction of Aphis is in the \"Trans.\r\nLinn. Soc.\" XXII. (1858), page 193. Prof. Owen had treated the subject\r\nin his introductory Hunterian lecture \"On Parthenogenesis\" (1849).\r\nHis theory cannot be fully given here. Briefly, he holds that\r\nparthenogenesis is due to the inheritance of a \"remnant of spermatic\r\nvirtue\": when the \"spermatic force\" or \"virtue\" is exhausted fresh\r\nimpregnation occurs. Huxley severely criticises both Owen's facts and\r\nhis theory.) question, but, for Heaven's sake, do not come the mild\r\nHindoo (whatever he may be) to Owen; your father confessor trembles for\r\nyou. I fancy Owen thinks much of this doctrine of his; I never from\r\nthe first believed it, and I cannot but think that the same power is\r\nconcerned in producing aphides without fertilisation, and producing, for\r\ninstance, nails on the amputated stump of a man's fingers, or the new\r\ntail of a lizard. By the way, I saw somewhere during the last week or\r\nso a statement of a man rearing from the same set of eggs winged and\r\nwingless aphides, which seemed new to me. Does not some Yankee say that\r\nthe American viviparous aphides are winged? I am particularly glad that\r\nyou are ruminating on the act of fertilisation: it has long seemed to me\r\nthe most wonderful and curious of physiological problems. I have\r\noften and often speculated for amusement on the subject, but quite\r\nfruitlessly. Do you not think that the conjugation of the Diatomaceae\r\nwill ultimately throw light on the subject? But the other day I came to\r\nthe conclusion that some day we shall have cases of young being produced\r\nfrom spermatozoa or pollen without an ovule. Approaching the subject\r\nfrom the side which attracts me most, viz., inheritance, I have\r\nlately been inclined to speculate, very crudely and indistinctly, that\r\npropagation by true fertilisation will turn out to be a sort of\r\nmixture, and not true fusion, of two distinct individuals, or rather of\r\ninnumerable individuals, as each parent has its parents and ancestors.\r\nI can understand on no other view the way in which crossed forms go back\r\nto so large an extent to ancestral forms. But all this, of course, is\r\ninfinitely crude. I hope to be in London in the course of this month,\r\nand there are two or three points which, for my own sake, I want to\r\ndiscuss briefly with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 58. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, September 26th [1857].\r\n\r\nThanks for your very pleasant note. It amuses me to see what a bug-bear\r\nI have made myself to you; when having written some very pungent and\r\ngood sentence it must be very disagreeable to have my face rise up like\r\nan ugly ghost. (58/1. This probably refers to Darwin's wish to moderate\r\na certain pugnacity in Huxley.) I have always suspected Agassiz of\r\nsuperficiality and wretched reasoning powers; but I think such men\r\ndo immense good in their way. See how he stirred up all Europe about\r\nglaciers. By the way, Lyell has been at the glaciers, or rather their\r\neffects, and seems to have done good work in testing and judging what\r\nothers have done...\r\n\r\nIn regard to classification and all the endless disputes about the\r\n\"Natural System,\" which no two authors define in the same way, I\r\nbelieve it ought, in accordance to my heterodox notions, to be simply\r\ngenealogical. But as we have no written pedigrees you will, perhaps,\r\nsay this will not help much; but I think it ultimately will, whenever\r\nheterodoxy becomes orthodoxy, for it will clear away an immense amount\r\nof rubbish about the value of characters, and will make the difference\r\nbetween analogy and homology clear. The time will come, I believe,\r\nthough I shall not live to see it, when we shall have very fairly true\r\ngenealogical trees of each great kingdom of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 59. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, December 16th [1857].\r\n\r\nIn my opinion your Catalogue (59/1. It appears from a letter to Sir\r\nJ.D. Hooker (December 25th, 1857) that the reference is to the proofs of\r\nHuxley's \"Explanatory Preface to the Catalogue of the Palaeontological\r\nCollection in the Museum of Practical Geology,\" by T.H. Huxley and R.\r\nEtheridge, 1865. Mr. Huxley appends a note at page xlix: \"It should\r\nbe noted that these pages were written before the appearance of Mr.\r\nDarwin's book on 'The Origin of Species'--a work which has effected a\r\nrevolution in biological speculation.\") is simply the very best resume,\r\nby far, on the whole science of Natural History, which I have ever seen.\r\nI really have no criticisms: I agree with every word. Your metaphors\r\nand explanations strike me as admirable. In many parts it is curious how\r\nwhat you have written agrees with what I have been writing, only with\r\nthe melancholy difference for me that you put everything in twice as\r\nstriking a manner as I do. I append, more for the sake of showing that I\r\nhave attended to the whole than for any other object, a few most trivial\r\ncriticisms.\r\n\r\nI was amused to meet with some of the arguments, which you advanced\r\nin talk with me, on classification; and it pleases me, [that] my long\r\nproses were so far not thrown away, as they led you to bring out here\r\nsome good sentences. But on classification (59/2. This probably refers\r\nto Mr. Huxley's discussion on \"Natural Classification,\" a subject\r\nhardly susceptible of fruitful treatment except from an evolutionary\r\nstandpoint.) I am not quite sure that I yet wholly go with you, though\r\nI agree with every word you have here said. The whole, I repeat, in my\r\nopinion is admirable and excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 60. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, February 28th [1858].\r\n\r\nHearty thanks for De Candolle received. I have put the big genera in\r\nhand. Also many thanks for your valuable remarks on the affinities\r\nof the species in great genera, which will be of much use to me in my\r\nchapter on classification. Your opinion is what I had expected from what\r\nlittle I knew, but I much wanted it confirmed, and many of your remarks\r\nwere more or less new to me and all of value.\r\n\r\nYou give a poor picture of the philosophy of Botany. From my ignorance,\r\nI suppose, I can hardly persuade myself that things are quite as bad as\r\nyou make them,--you might have been writing remarks on Ornithology! I\r\nshall meditate much on your remarks, which will also come in very useful\r\nwhen I write and consider my tables of big and small genera. I grieve\r\nfor myself to say that Watson agrees with your view, but with much\r\ndoubt. I gave him no guide what your opinion was. I have written to A.\r\nGray and to X., who--i.e. the latter--on this point may be looked at as\r\nS. Smith's Foolometer.\r\n\r\nI am now working several of the large local Floras, with leaving out\r\naltogether all the smallest genera. When I have done this, and seen what\r\nthe sections of the largest genera say, and seen what the results are\r\nof range and commonness of varying species, I must come to some definite\r\nconclusion whether or not entirely to give up the ghost. I shall then\r\nshow how my theory points, how the facts stand, then state the nature of\r\nyour grievous assault and yield entirely or defend the case as far as I\r\ncan honestly.\r\n\r\nAgain I thank you for your invaluable assistance. I have not felt\r\nthe blow [Hooker's criticisms] so much of late, as I have been beyond\r\nmeasure interested on the constructive instinct of the hive-bee. Adios,\r\nyou terrible worrier of poor theorists!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 61. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1858?]\r\n\r\nMany thanks for Ledebour and still more for your letter, with its\r\nadmirable resume of all your objections. It is really most kind of you\r\nto take so very much trouble about what seems to you, and probably is,\r\nmere vagaries.\r\n\r\nI will earnestly try and be cautious. I will write out my tables and\r\nconclusion, and (when well copied out) I hope you will be so kind as\r\nto read it. I will then put it by and after some months look at it with\r\nfresh eyes. I will briefly work in all your objections and Watson's. I\r\nlabour under a great difficulty from feeling sure that, with what very\r\nlittle systematic work I have done, small genera were more interesting\r\nand therefore more attracted my attention.\r\n\r\nOne of your remarks I do not see the bearing of under your point of\r\nview--namely, that in monotypic genera \"the variation and variability\"\r\nare \"much more frequently noticed\" than in polytypic genera. I hardly\r\nlike to ask, but this is the only one of your arguments of which I do\r\nnot see the bearing; and I certainly should be very glad to know. I\r\nbelieve I am the slowest (perhaps the worst) thinker in England; and I\r\nnow consequently fully admit the full hostility of Urticaceae, which I\r\nwill give in my tables.\r\n\r\nI will make no remarks on your objections, as I do hope you will read my\r\nMS., which will not cost you much trouble when fairly copied out. From\r\nmy own experience, I hardly believe that the most sagacious observers,\r\nwithout counting, could have predicted whether there were more or fewer\r\nrecorded varieties in large or small genera; for I found, when actually\r\nmaking the list, that I could never strike a balance in my mind,--a good\r\nmany varieties occurring together, in small or in large genera, always\r\nthrew me off the balance...\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have just thought that your remark about the much variation of\r\nmonotypic genera was to show me that even in these, the smallest genera,\r\nthere was much variability. If this be so, then do not answer; and I\r\nwill so understand it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 62. TO J.D. HOOKER. February 23rd [1858].\r\n\r\nWill you think of some of the largest genera with which you are well\r\nacquainted, and then suppose 4/5 of the species utterly destroyed and\r\nunknown in the sections (as it were) as much as possible in the centre\r\nof such great genera. Then would the remaining 1/5 of the species,\r\nforming a few sections, be, according to the general practice of average\r\ngood Botanists, ranked as distinct genera? Of course they would in that\r\ncase be closely related genera. The question, in fact, is, are all the\r\nspecies in a gigantic genus kept together in that genus, because they\r\nare really so very closely similar as to be inseparable? or is it\r\nbecause no chasms or boundaries can be drawn separating the many\r\nspecies? The question might have been put for Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 63. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, February 9th [1858].\r\n\r\nI should be very much obliged for your opinion on the enclosed. You may\r\nremember in the three first volumes tabulated, all orders went right\r\nexcept Labiatae. By the way, if by any extraordinary chance you have\r\nnot thrown away the scrap of paper with former results, I wish you would\r\nreturn it, for I have lost my copy, and I shall have all the division\r\nto do again; but DO NOT hunt for it, for in any case I should have gone\r\nover the calculation again.\r\n\r\nNow I have done the three other volumes. You will see that all species\r\nin the six volumes together go right, and likewise all orders in the\r\nthree last volumes, except Verbenaceae. Is not Verbenaceae very closely\r\nallied to Labiatae? If so, one would think that it was not mere chance,\r\nthis coincidence. The species in Labiatae and Verbenaceae together\r\nare between 1/5 and 1/6 of all the species (15,645), which I have now\r\ntabulated.\r\n\r\nNow, bearing in mind the many local Floras which I have tabulated\r\n(belting the whole northern hemisphere), and considering that they (and\r\nauthors of D.C. Prodromus) would probably take different degrees of care\r\nin recording varieties, and the genera would be divided on different\r\nprinciples by different men, etc., I am much surprised at the uniformity\r\nof the result, and I am satisfied that there must be truth in the rule\r\nthat the small genera vary less than the large. What do you think?\r\nHypothetically I can conjecture how the Labiatae might fail--namely, if\r\nsome small divisions of the Order were now coming into importance in the\r\nworld and varying much and making species. This makes me want to\r\nknow whether you could divide the Labiatae into a few great natural\r\ndivisions, and then I would tabulate them separately as sub-orders. I\r\nsee Lindley makes so many divisions that there would not be enough in\r\neach for an average. I send the table of the Labiatae for the chance\r\nof your being able to do this for me. You might draw oblique lines\r\nincluding and separating both large and small genera. I have also\r\ndivided all the species into two equal masses, and my rule holds good\r\nfor all the species in a mass in the six volumes; but it fails\r\nin several (four) large Orders--viz. Labiatae, Scrophulariaceae,\r\nAcanthaceae, and Proteaceae. But, then, when the species are divided\r\ninto two almost exactly equal divisions, the divisions with large genera\r\nare so very few: for instance, in Solanaceae, Solanum balances all\r\nothers. In Labiatae seven gigantic genera balance all others (viz. 113),\r\nand in Proteaceae five genera balance all others. Now, according to\r\nmy hypothetical notions, I am far from supposing that all genera go on\r\nincreasing forever, and therefore I am not surprised at this result,\r\nwhen the division is so made that only a very few genera are on one\r\nside. But, according to my notions, the sections or sub-genera of the\r\ngigantic genera ought to obey my rule (i.e., supposing a gigantic genus\r\nhad come to its maximum, whatever increase was still going on ought to\r\nbe going on in the larger sub-genera). Do you think that the sections\r\nof the gigantic genera in D.C. Prodromus are generally NATURAL: i.e.\r\nnot founded on mere artificial characters? If you think that they are\r\ngenerally made as natural as they can be, then I should like very\r\nmuch to tabulate the sub-genera, considering them for the time as good\r\ngenera. In this case, and if you do not think me unreasonable to ask it,\r\nI should be very glad of the loan of Volumes X., XI., XII., and\r\nXIV., which include Acanthaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Labiatae, and\r\nProteaceae,--that is, the orders which, when divided quite equally, do\r\nnot accord with my rule, and in which a very few genera balance all the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nI have written you a tremendous long prose.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 64. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, June 8th [1858].\r\n\r\nI am confined to the sofa with boils, so you must let me write in\r\npencil. You would laugh if you could know how much your note pleased me.\r\nI had the firmest conviction that you would say all my MS. was bosh, and\r\nthank God, you are one of the few men who dare speak the truth. Though I\r\nshould not have much cared about throwing away what you have seen, yet\r\nI have been forced to confess to myself that all was much alike, and\r\nif you condemned that you would condemn all my life's work, and that I\r\nconfess made me a little low; but I could have borne it, for I have the\r\nconviction that I have honestly done my best. The discussion comes in at\r\nthe end of the long chapter on variation in a state of nature, so that I\r\nhave discussed, as far as I am able, what to call varieties. I will try\r\nto leave out all allusion to genera coming in and out in this part,\r\ntill when I discuss the \"Principle of Divergence,\" which, with \"Natural\r\nSelection,\" is the keystone of my book; and I have very great confidence\r\nit is sound. I would have this discussion copied out, if I could really\r\nthink it would not bore you to read,--for, believe me, I value to the\r\nfull every word of criticism from you, and the advantage which I have\r\nderived from you cannot be told...\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that poor old Brown is dying so easily...\r\n\r\nYou will think it paltry, but as I was asked to pay for printing the\r\nDiploma [from a Society of which he had been made an honorary member],\r\nI did not like to refuse, so I send 1 pound. But I think it a shabby\r\nproceeding. If a gentleman did me some service, though unasked to do it,\r\nand then demanded payment, I should pay him, and think him a shabby dog;\r\nand on this principle I send my 1 pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n(65/1. The following four letters refer to an inquiry instituted in 1858\r\nby the Trustees of the British Museum as to the disposal of the Natural\r\nHistory Collections. The inquiry was one of the first steps towards the\r\nestablishment of the Cromwell Road Museum, which was effected in 1875.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 65. TO R.I. MURCHISON. Down, June 19th [1858].\r\n\r\nI have just received your note. Unfortunately I cannot attend at the\r\nBritish Museum on Monday. I do not suppose my opinion on the subject\r\nof your note can be of any value, as I have not much considered the\r\nsubject, or had the advantage of discussing it with other naturalists.\r\nBut my impression is, that there is much weight in what you say about\r\nnot breaking up the natural history collection of the British Museum. I\r\nthink a national collection ought to be in London. I can, however, see\r\nthat some weighty arguments might be advanced in favour of Kew, owing to\r\nthe immense value of Sir W. Hooker's collection and library; but these\r\nare private property, and I am not aware that there is any certainty\r\nof their always remaining at Kew. Had this been the case, I should have\r\nthought that the botanical collection might have been removed there\r\nwithout endangering the other branches of the collections. But I think\r\nit would be the greatest evil which could possibly happen to natural\r\nscience in this country if the other collections were ever to be removed\r\nfrom the British Museum and Library.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 66. TO T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n(66/1. The memorial referred to in the following letter was addressed\r\non November 18th to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It was signed\r\nby Huxley, Bentham, W.H. Harvey, Henfrey, Henslow, Lindley, Busk,\r\nCarpenter, and Darwin. The memorial, which is accessible, as published\r\nin the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" November 27th, 1858, page 861,\r\nrecommended, speaking generally, the consolidation of the National\r\nBotanical collections at Kew.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1900, a Committee was appointed by the Lords Commissioners\r\nof the Treasury \"to consider the present arrangements under which\r\nbotanical work is done and collections maintained by the Trustees of\r\nthe British Museum, and under the First Commissioner of Works at Kew,\r\nrespectively; and to report what changes (if any) in those arrangements\r\nare necessary or desirable in order to avoid duplication of work and\r\ncollections at the two institutions.\" The Committee published their\r\nreport in March, 1901, recommending an arrangement similar to that\r\nproposed in 1858.)\r\n\r\nDown, October 23rd [1858].\r\n\r\nThe names which you give as supporting your memorial make me quite\r\ndistrust my own judgment; but, as I must say yea or nay, I am forced\r\nto say that I doubt the wisdom of the movement, and am not willing\r\nat present to sign. My reasons, perhaps of very little value, are as\r\nfollows. The governing classes are thoroughly unscientific, and the men\r\nof art and of archaeology have much greater weight with Government than\r\nwe have. If we make a move to separate from the British Museum, I cannot\r\nbut fear that we may go to the dogs. I think we owe our position in\r\nlarge part to the hundreds of thousands of people who visit the British\r\nMuseum, attracted by the heterogeneous mixture of objects. If we lost\r\nthis support, as I think we should--for a mere collection of animals\r\ndoes not seem very attractive to the masses (judging from the Museum\r\nof the Zoological Society, formerly in Leicester Square)--then I do\r\nnot think we should get nearly so much aid from Government. Therefore I\r\nshould be inclined to stick to the mummies and Assyrian gods as long as\r\nwe could. If we knew that Government was going to turn us out, then,\r\nand not till then, I should be inclined to make an energetic move. If we\r\nwere to separate, I do not believe that we should have funds granted for\r\nthe many books required for occasional reference: each man must speak\r\nfrom his own experience. I have so repeatedly required to see old\r\nTransactions and old Travels, etc., that I should regret extremely, when\r\nat work at the British Museum, to be separated from the entire library.\r\nThe facilities for working at certain great classes--as birds, large\r\nfossils, etc.--are no doubt as bad as possible, or rather impossible, on\r\nthe open days; but I have found the working rooms of the Assistants very\r\nconvenient for all other classes on all days.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the botanical collections, I am too ignorant to express any\r\nopinion. The point seems to be how far botanists would object to\r\ntravel to Kew; but there are evidently many great advantages in the\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nIf I had my own way, I would make the British Museum collection only a\r\ntypical one for display, which would be quite as amusing and far more\r\ninstructive to the populace (and I think to naturalists) than the\r\npresent enormous display of birds and mammals. I would save expense of\r\nstuffing, and would keep all skins, except a few \"typicals,\" in drawers.\r\nThus much room would be saved, and a little more space could be given to\r\nreal workers, who could work all day. Rooms fitted up with thousands of\r\ndrawers would cost very little. With this I should be contented. Until I\r\nhad pretty sure information that we were going to be turned out, I would\r\nnot stir in the matter. With such opponents as you name, I daresay I am\r\nquite wrong; but this is my best, though doubtful, present judgment...\r\n\r\nIt seems to me dangerous even to hint at a new Scientific Museum--a\r\npopular Museum, and to subsidise the Zoological Gardens; it would, I\r\nthink, frighten any Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 67. TO J.D. HOOKER. Moor Park, Farnham, Surrey [October] 29th\r\n[1858].\r\n\r\nAs you say that you have good private information that Government does\r\nintend to remove the collection from the British Museum, the case to\r\nme individually is wholly changed; and as the memorial now stands, with\r\nsuch expression at its head, I have no objection whatever to sign. I\r\nmust express a very strong opinion that it would be an immense evil to\r\nremove to Kensington, not on account of the men of science so much\r\nas for the masses in the whole eastern and central part of London. I\r\nfurther think it would be a great evil to separate a typical collection\r\n(which I can by no means look at as only popular) from the collection in\r\nfull. Might not some expression be added, even stronger than those now\r\nused, on the display (which is a sort of vanity in the curators) of such\r\na vast number of birds and mammals, with such a loss of room. I am low\r\nat the conviction that Government will never give money enough for a\r\nreally good library.\r\n\r\nI do not want to be crotchety, but I should hate signing without some\r\nexpression about the site being easily accessible to the populace of the\r\nwhole of London.\r\n\r\nI repeat, as things now stand, I shall be proud to sign.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 68. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, November 3rd [1858].\r\n\r\nI most entirely subscribe to all you say in your note. I have had some\r\ncorrespondence with Hooker on the subject. As it seems certain that\r\na movement in the British Museum is generally anticipated, my main\r\nobjection is quite removed; and, as I have told Hooker, I have no\r\nobjection whatever to sign a memorial of the nature of the one he sent\r\nme or that now returned. Both seem to me very good. I cannot help being\r\nfearful whether Government will ever grant money enough for books. I can\r\nsee many advantages in not being under the unmotherly wing of art and\r\narchaeology, and my only fear was that we were not strong enough to live\r\nwithout some protection, so profound, I think, is the contempt for and\r\nignorance of Natural Science amongst the gentry of England. Hooker tells\r\nme that I should be converted into favour of Kensington Gore if I heard\r\nall that could be said in its favour; but I cannot yet help thinking\r\nso western a locality a great misfortune. Has Lyell been consulted? His\r\nwould be a powerful name, and such names go for much with our ignorant\r\nGovernors. You seem to have taken much trouble in the business, and I\r\nhonour you for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 69. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 9th [1858].\r\n\r\nI am quite delighted to hear about the Copley and Lyell. (69/1. The\r\nCopley Medal of the Royal Society was awarded to Lyell in 1858.) I have\r\ngrown hot with indignation many times thinking of the way the proposal\r\nwas met last year, according to your account of it. I am also very glad\r\nto hear of Hancock (Albany Hancock received a Royal Medal in 1858.); it\r\nwill show the provincials are not neglected. Altogether the medals are\r\ncapital. I shall be proud and bound to help in any way about the eloge,\r\nwhich is rather a heavy tax on proposers of medals, as I found about\r\nRichardson and Westwood; but Lyell's case will be twenty times as\r\ndifficult. I will begin this very evening dotting down a few remarks\r\non Lyell; though, no doubt, most will be superfluous, and several\r\nwould require deliberate consideration. Anyhow, such notes may be a\r\npreliminary aid to you; I will send them in a few days' time, and will\r\ndo anything else you may wish...\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have had a letter from Henslow this morning. He comes here on\r\n[Thursday] 25th, and I shall be delighted to see him; but it stops my\r\ncoming to the Club, as I had arranged to do, and now I suppose I shall\r\nnot be in London till December 16th, if odds and ends do not compel me\r\nto come sooner. Of course I have not said a word to Henslow of my change\r\nof plans. I had looked forward with pleasure to a chat with you and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nP.S. 2.--I worked all yesterday evening in thinking, and have written\r\nthe paper sent by this post this morning. Not one sentence would do, but\r\nit is the sort of rough sketch which I should have drawn out if I had\r\nhad to do it. God knows whether it will at all aid you. It is miserably\r\nwritten, with horridly bad metaphors, probably horrid bad grammar. It\r\nis my deliberate impression, such as I should have written to any friend\r\nwho had asked me what I thought of Lyell's merits. I will do anything\r\nelse which you may wish, or that I can.\r\n\r\nLETTER 70. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 30th [1858].\r\n\r\nI have had this copied to save you trouble, as it was vilely written,\r\nand is now vilely expressed.\r\n\r\nYour letter has interested me greatly; but how inextricable are the\r\nsubjects which we are discussing! I do not think I said that I thought\r\nthe productions of Asia were HIGHER (70/1. On the use of the terms\r\n\"higher\" and \"lower\" see Letters 35 and 36.) than those of Australia. I\r\nintend carefully to avoid this expression (70/2. In a paper of pencilled\r\nnotes pinned into Darwin's copy of the \"Vestiges\" occur the words:\r\n\"Never use the word (sic) higher and lower.\"), for I do not think that\r\nany one has a definite idea what is meant by higher, except in classes\r\nwhich can loosely be compared with man. On our theory of Natural\r\nSelection, if the organisms of any area belonging to the Eocene or\r\nSecondary periods were put into competition with those now existing in\r\nthe same area (or probably in any part of the world) they (i.e. the old\r\nones) would be beaten hollow and be exterminated; if the theory be true,\r\nthis must be so. In the same manner, I believe, a greater number of\r\nthe productions of Asia, the largest territory in the world, would beat\r\nthose of Australia, than conversely. So it seems to be between Europe\r\nand North America, for I can hardly believe in the difference of the\r\nstream of commerce causing so great a difference in the proportions\r\nof immigrants. But this sort of highness (I wish I could invent some\r\nexpression, and must try to do so) is different from highness in the\r\ncommon acceptation of the word. It might be connected with degradation\r\nof organisation: thus the blind degraded worm-like snake (Typhlops)\r\nmight supplant the true earthworm. Here then would be degradation in\r\nthe class, but certainly increase in the scale of organisation in the\r\ngeneral inhabitants of the country. On the other hand, it would be quite\r\nas easy to believe that true earthworms might beat out the Typhlops. I\r\ndo not see how this \"competitive highness\" can be tested in any way by\r\nus. And this is a comfort to me when mentally comparing the Silurian\r\nand Recent organisms. Not that I doubt a long course of \"competitive\r\nhighness\" will ultimately make the organisation higher in every sense of\r\nthe word; but it seems most difficult to test it. Look at the Erigeron\r\ncanadensis on the one hand and Anacharis (70/3. Anacharis (Elodea\r\ncanadensis) and Erigeron canadensis are both successful immigrants\r\nfrom America.) on the other; these plants must have some advantage over\r\nEuropean productions, to spread as they have. Yet who could discover it?\r\nMonkeys can co-exist with sloths and opossums, orders at the bottom\r\nof the scale; and the opossums might well be beaten by placental\r\ninsectivores, coming from a country where there were no monkeys, etc.\r\nI should be sorry to give up the view that an old and very large\r\ncontinuous territory would generally produce organisms higher in the\r\ncompetitive sense than a smaller territory. I may, of course, be quite\r\nwrong about the plants of Australia (and your facts are, of course,\r\nquite new to me on their highness), but when I read the accounts of the\r\nimmense spreading of European plants in Australia, and think of the wool\r\nand corn brought thence to Europe, and not one plant naturalised, I\r\ncan hardly avoid the suspicion that Europe beats Australia in its\r\nproductions. If many (i.e. more than one or two) Australian plants are\r\nTRULY naturalised in India (N.B. Naturalisation on Indian mountains\r\nhardly quite fair, as mountains are small islands in the land) I must\r\nstrike my colours. I should be glad to hear whether what I have written\r\nvery obscurely on this point produces ANY effect on you; for I want to\r\nclear my mind, as perhaps I should put a sentence or two in my abstract\r\non this subject. (70/4. Abstract was Darwin's name for the \"Origin\"\r\nduring parts of 1858 and 1859.)\r\n\r\nI have always been willing to strike my colours on former immense tracts\r\nof land in oceans, if any case required it in an eminent degree.\r\nPerhaps yours may be a case, but at present I greatly prefer land in\r\nthe Antarctic regions, where now there is only ice and snow, but which\r\nbefore the Glacial period might well have been clothed by vegetation.\r\nYou have thus to invent far less land, and that more central; and aid is\r\ngot by floating ice for transporting seed.\r\n\r\nI hope I shall not weary you by scribbling my notions at this length.\r\nAfter writing last to you I began to think that the Malay Land might\r\nhave existed through part of the Glacial epoch. Why I at first doubted\r\nwas from the difference of existing mammals in different islands;\r\nbut many are very close, and some identical in the islands, and I am\r\nconstantly deceiving myself from thinking of the little change which\r\nthe shells and plants, whilst all co-existing in their own northern\r\nhemisphere, have undergone since the Glacial epoch; but I am convinced\r\nthat this is most false reasoning, for the relations of organism to new\r\norganisms, when thrown together, are by far the most important.\r\n\r\nWhen you speak of plants having undergone more change since old\r\ngeological periods than animals, are you not rather comparing plants\r\nwith higher animals? Think how little some, indeed many, mollusca have\r\nchanged. Remember Silurian Nautilus, Lingula and other Brachiopods, and\r\nNucula, and amongst Echinoderms, the Silurian Asterias, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat you say about lowness of brackish-water plants interests me.\r\nI remember that they are apt to be social (i.e. many individuals in\r\ncomparison to specific forms), and I should be tempted to look at this\r\nas a case of a very small area, and consequently of very few individuals\r\nin comparison with those on the land or in pure fresh-water; and hence\r\nless development (odious word!) than on land or fresh-water. But here\r\ncomes in your two-edged sword! I should like much to see any paper on\r\nplants of brackish water or on the edge of the sea; but I suppose such\r\nhas never been published.\r\n\r\nThanks about Nelumbium, for I think this was the very plant which from\r\nthe size of seed astonished me, and which A. De Candolle adduced as\r\na marvellous case of almost impossible transport. I now find to my\r\nsurprise that herons do feed sometimes on [illegible] fruit; and grebes\r\non seeds of Compositae.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for offer of help about a grant for the Abstract; but I\r\nshould hope it would sell enough to pay expenses.\r\n\r\nI am reading your letter and scribbling as I go on.\r\n\r\nYour oak and chestnut case seems very curious; is it not the more so as\r\nbeeches have gone to, or come from the south? But I vehemently protest\r\nagainst you or any one making such cases especial marvels, without you\r\nare prepared to say why each species in any flora is twice or thrice,\r\netc., rarer than each other species which grows in the same soil. The\r\nmore I think, the more evident is it to me how utterly ignorant we are\r\nof the thousand contingencies on which range, frequency, and extinction\r\nof each species depend.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes thought, from Edentata (70/5. No doubt a slip of the\r\npen for Monotremata.) and Marsupialia, that Australia retains a remnant\r\nof the former and ancient state of the fauna of the world, and I suppose\r\nthat you are coming to some such conclusion for plants; but is not the\r\nrelation between the Cape and Australia too special for such views? I\r\ninfer from your writings that the relation is too special between Fuegia\r\nand Australia to allow us to look at the resemblances in certain plants\r\nas the relics of mundane resemblances. On the other hand, [have] not\r\nthe Sandwich Islands in the Northern Hemisphere some odd relations\r\nto Australia? When we are dead and gone what a noble subject will be\r\nGeographical Distribution!\r\n\r\nYou may say what you like, but you will never convince me that I do not\r\nowe you ten times as much as you can owe me. Farewell, my dear Hooker. I\r\nam sorry to hear that you are both unwell with influenza. Do not bother\r\nyourself in answering anything in this, except your general impression\r\non the battle between N. and S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.III.--EVOLUTION, 1859-1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 71. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, April 6th, 1859.\r\n\r\nI this morning received your pleasant and friendly note of November\r\n30th. The first part of my MS. is in Murray's hands to see if he likes\r\nto publish it. There is no preface, but a short introduction, which\r\nmust be read by every one who reads my book. The second paragraph in the\r\nintroduction (71/1. \"Origin of Species,\" Edition I., 1859, pages 1 and\r\n2.) I have had copied verbatim from my foul copy, and you will, I hope,\r\nthink that I have fairly noticed your paper in the \"Linn. Journal.\"\r\n(71/2. \"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties, and on the\r\nPerpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection.\" By\r\nCharles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace. Communicated by Sir Charles\r\nLyell and J.D. Hooker. \"Journ. Linn. Soc.\" Volume III., page 45, 1859.\r\n(Read July 1st, 1858.)) You must remember that I am now publishing only\r\nan abstract, and I give no references. I shall, of course, allude to\r\nyour paper on distribution (71/3. \"On the Law which has regulated the\r\nIntroduction of New Species\" (A.R. Wallace). \"Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.\"\r\nVolume XVI., page 184, 1855. The law alluded to is thus stated by\r\nWallace: \"Every species has come into existence coincident both in space\r\nand time with a pre-existing closely allied species\" (loc. cit., page\r\n186).); and I have added that I know from correspondence that your\r\nexplanation of your law is the same as that which I offer. You are\r\nright, that I came to the conclusion that selection was the principle\r\nof change from the study of domesticated productions; and then, reading\r\nMalthus, I saw at once how to apply this principle. Geographical\r\ndistribution and geological relations of extinct to recent inhabitants\r\nof South America first led me to the subject: especially the case of\r\nthe Galapagos Islands. I hope to go to press in the early part of next\r\nmonth. It will be a small volume of about five hundred pages or so. I\r\nwill of course send you a copy. I forget whether I told you that Hooker,\r\nwho is our best British botanist and perhaps the best in the world, is a\r\nfull convert, and is now going immediately to publish his confession\r\nof faith; and I expect daily to see proof-sheets. (71/4. \"The Flora of\r\nAustralia, etc., an Introductory Essay to the Flora of Tasmania.\" London\r\n1859.) Huxley is changed, and believes in mutation of species: whether a\r\nconvert to us, I do not quite know. We shall live to see all the younger\r\nmen converts. My neighbour and an excellent naturalist, J. Lubbock,\r\nis an enthusiastic convert. I see that you are doing great work in the\r\nArchipelago; and most heartily do I sympathise with you. For God's sake\r\ntake care of your health. There have been few such noble labourers in\r\nthe cause of Natural Science as you are.\r\n\r\nP.S. You cannot tell how I admire your spirit, in the manner in which\r\nyou have taken all that was done about publishing all our papers. I\r\nhad actually written a letter to you, stating that I would not publish\r\nanything before you had published. I had not sent that letter to the\r\npost when I received one from Lyell and Hooker, urging me to send some\r\nMS. to them, and allow them to act as they thought fair and honestly to\r\nboth of us; and I did so.\r\n\r\n(71/5. The following is the passage from the Introduction to the \"Origin\r\nof Species,\" referred to in the first paragraph of the above letter.)\r\n\r\n\"My work is now nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three\r\nyears more to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have\r\nbeen urged to publish this Abstract. I have more especially been induced\r\nto do this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the Natural History of\r\nthe Malay Archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general\r\nconclusions that I have on the origin of species. Last year he sent to\r\nme a memoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward it\r\nto Sir Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is\r\npublished in the third volume of the Journal of that Society. Sir C.\r\nLyell and Dr. Hooker, who both knew of my work--the latter having read\r\nmy sketch of 1844--honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish,\r\nwith Mr. Wallace's excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my\r\nmanuscripts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 72. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 3rd, 1859.\r\n\r\nWith respect to reversion, I have been raking up vague recollections of\r\nvague facts; and the impression on my mind is rather more in favour of\r\nreversion than it was when you were here.\r\n\r\nIn my abstract (72/1. \"The Origin of Species.\") I give only a paragraph\r\non the general case of reversion, though I enter in detail on some cases\r\nof reversion of a special character. I have not as yet put all my facts\r\non this subject in mass, so can come to no definite conclusion. But as\r\nsingle characters may revert, I must say that I see no improbability in\r\nseveral reverting. As I do not believe any well-founded experiments or\r\nfacts are known, each must form his opinion from vague generalities.\r\nI think you confound two rather distinct considerations; a variation\r\narises from any cause, and reversion is not opposed to this, but solely\r\nto its inheritance. Not but what I believe what we must call perhaps\r\na dozen distinct laws are all struggling against each other in every\r\nvariation which ever arises. To give my impression, if I were forced\r\nto bet whether or not, after a hundred generations of growth in a poor\r\nsandy soil, a cauliflower and red cabbage would or would not revert to\r\nthe same form, I must say I would rather stake my money that they would.\r\nBut in such a case the conditions of life are changed (and here comes\r\nthe question of direct influence of condition), and there is to be no\r\nselection, the comparatively sudden effect of man's selection are left\r\nto the free play of reversion.\r\n\r\nIn short, I dare not come to any conclusion without comparing all facts\r\nwhich I have collected, and I do not think there are many.\r\n\r\nPlease do not say to any one that I thought my book on species would be\r\nfairly popular and have a fairly remunerative sale (which was the height\r\nof my ambition), for if it prove a dead failure it would make me the\r\nmore ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 73. TO W.H. MILLER. Down, June 5th [1859].\r\n\r\nI thank you much for your letter. Had I seen the interest of my remark\r\nI would have made many more measurements, though I did make several.\r\nI stated the facts merely to give the general reader an idea of the\r\nthickness of the walls. (73/1. The walls of bees' cells: see Letter\r\n173.)\r\n\r\nEspecially if I had seen that the fact had any general bearing, I should\r\nhave stated that as far as I could measure, the walls are by no means\r\nperfectly of the same thickness. Also I should have stated that the\r\nchief difference is when the thickness of walls of the upper part of\r\nthe hexagon and of the pyramidal basal plates are contrasted. Will you\r\noblige me by looking with a strong lens at the bit of comb, brushing off\r\nwith a knife the upper thickened edges, and then compare, by eye alone,\r\nthe thickness of the walls there with the thickness of the basal plates,\r\nas seen in any cross section. I should very much like to hear whether,\r\neven in this way, the difference is not perceptible. It is generally\r\nthus perceptible by comparing the thickness of the walls of the hexagon\r\n(if not taken very close to the angle) near to the basal plates, where\r\nthe comparison by eye is of course easier. Your letter actually turned\r\nme sick with panic; from not seeing any great importance [in the]\r\nfact, till I looked at my notes, I did not remember that I made several\r\nmeasurements. I have now repeated the same measurements, roughly with\r\nthe same general results, but the difference, I think, is hardly double.\r\n\r\nI should not have mentioned the thickness of the basal plates at all,\r\nhad I not thought it would give an unfair notion of the thickness of the\r\nwalls to state the lesser measurements alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 74. TO W.H. MILLER. [1859]\r\n\r\nI had no thought that you would measure the thickness of the walls of\r\nthe cells; but if you will, and allow me to give your measurements,\r\nit will be an immense advantage. As it is no trouble, I send more\r\nspecimens. If you measure, please observe that I measured the thickness\r\nof the walls of the hexagonal prisms not very near the base; but from\r\nyour very interesting remarks the lower part of the walls ought to be\r\nmeasured.\r\n\r\nThank you for the suggestion about how bees judge of angles and\r\ndistances. I will keep it in mind. It is a complete perplexity to me,\r\nand yet certainly insects can rudely somehow judge of distance. There\r\nare special difficulties on account of the gradation in size between the\r\nworker-scells and the larger drone-cells. I am trying to test the case\r\npractically by getting combs of different species, and of our own bee\r\nfrom different climates. I have lately had some from the W. Indies of\r\nour common bee, but the cells SEEM certainly to be larger; but they have\r\nnot yet been carefully measured. I will keep your suggestion in mind\r\nwhenever I return to experiments on living bees; but that will not be\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nAs you have been considering my little discussion in relation to Lord\r\nBrougham (74/1. Lord Brougham's paper on \"The Mathematical Structure\r\nof Bees' Cells,\" read before the National Institute of France in May,\r\n1858.), and as I have been more vituperated for this part than for\r\nalmost any other, I should like just to tell you how I think the case\r\nstands. The discussion viewed by itself is worth little more than the\r\npaper on which it is printed, except in so far as it contains three or\r\nfour certainly new facts. But to those who are inclined to believe the\r\ngeneral truth of the conclusion that species and their instincts are\r\nslowly modified by what I call Natural Selection, I think my discussion\r\nnearly removes a very great difficulty. I believe in its truth chiefly\r\nfrom the existence of the Melipona, which makes a comb so intermediate\r\nin structure between that of the humble and hive-bee, and especially\r\nfrom the new and curious fact of the bees making smooth cups or saucers\r\nwhen they excavated in a thick piece of wax, which saucers stood so\r\nclose that hexagons were built on their intersecting edges. And, lastly,\r\nbecause when they excavated on a thin slip of wax, the excavation on\r\nboth sides of similar smooth basins was stopped, and flat planes left\r\nbetween the nearly opposed basins. If my view were wholly false these\r\ncases would, I think, never have occurred. Sedgwick and Co. may abuse me\r\nto their hearts' content, but I shall as yet continue to think that mine\r\nis a rational explanation (as far as it goes) of their method of work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 75. TO W.H. MILLER.\r\n\r\nDown, December 1st [1859].\r\n\r\nSome months ago you were so kind as to say you would measure the\r\nthickness of the walls of the basal and side plates of the cell of the\r\nbee. Could you find time to do so soon? Why I want it soon, is that I\r\nhave lately heard from Murray that he sold at his sale far more copies\r\nthan he has of the \"Origin of Species,\" and that I must immediately\r\nprepare a new edition, which I am now correcting. By the way, I hear\r\nfrom Murray that all the attacks heaped on my book do not seem to have\r\nat all injured the sale, which will make poor dear old Sedgwick groan.\r\nIf the basal plates and walls do differ considerably in thickness, as\r\nthey certainly did in the one or two cells which I measured without\r\nparticular care (as I never thought the point of any importance), will\r\nyou tell me the bearing of the fact as simply as you can, for the chance\r\nof one so stupid as I am in geometry being able to understand?\r\n\r\nWould the greater thickness of the basal plates and of the rim of the\r\nhexagons be a good adaptation to carry the vertical weight of the cells\r\nfilled with honey and supporting clusters of living bees?\r\n\r\nWill you endeavour to screw out time and grant me this favour?\r\n\r\nP.S. If the result of your measurement of the thickness of the walls\r\nturns out at all what I have asserted, would it not be worth while to\r\nwrite a little bit of a paper on the subject of your former note; and\r\n\"pluck\" the bees if they deserve this degradation? Many mathematicians\r\nseem to have thought the subject worthy of attention. When the cells are\r\nfull of honey and hang vertically they have to support a great weight.\r\nCan the thicker basal plates be a contrivance to give strength to the\r\nwhole comb, with less consumption of wax, than if all the sides of the\r\nhexagons were thickened?\r\n\r\nThis crude notion formerly crossed my mind; but of course it is beyond\r\nme even to conjecture how the case would be.\r\n\r\nA mathematician, Mr. Wright, has been writing on the geometry of\r\nbee-cells in the United States in consequence of my book; but I can\r\nhardly understand his paper. (75/1. Chauncey Wright, \"Remarks on the\r\nArchitecture of Bees\" (\"Amer. Acad. Proc.\" IV., 1857-60, page 432.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 76. TO T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n(76/1. The date of this letter is unfortunately doubtful, otherwise\r\nit would prove that at an early date he was acquainted with Erasmus\r\nDarwin's views on evolution, a fact which has not always been\r\nrecognised. We can hardly doubt that it was written in 1859, for at\r\nthis time Mr. Huxley was collecting facts about breeding for his lecture\r\ngiven at the Royal Institution on February 10th, 1860, on \"Species and\r\nRaces and their Origin.\" See \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 281.)\r\n\r\nDown [June?] 9 [1859?].\r\n\r\nIf on the 11th you have half an hour to spare, you might like to see a\r\nvery good show of pigeons, and the enclosed card will admit you.\r\n\r\nThe history of error is quite unimportant, but it is curious to observe\r\nhow exactly and accurately my grandfather (in \"Zoonomia,\" Volume I.,\r\npage 504, 1794) gives Lamarck's theory. I will quote one sentence.\r\nSpeaking of birds' beaks, he says: \"All which seem to have been\r\ngradually produced during many generations by the perpetual endeavour of\r\nthe creatures to supply the want of food, and to have been delivered\r\nto their posterity with constant improvement of them for the purposes\r\nrequired.\" Lamarck published \"Hist. Zoolog.\" in 1809. The \"Zoonomia\" was\r\ntranslated into many languages.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 77. TO C. LYELL. Down, 28 [June 1859].\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while troubling you, but my conscience is uneasy at\r\nhaving forgotten to thank you for your \"Etna\" (77/1. \"On the Structure\r\nof Lavas which have been consolidated on Steep Slopes, with remarks\r\non the Mode of Origin of Mount Etna, and on the Theory of 'Craters of\r\nElevation'\" (\"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\" Volume CXLVIII., 1858, page 703).),\r\nwhich seems to me a magnificent contribution to volcanic geology, and I\r\nshould think you might now rest on your oars in this department.\r\n\r\nAs soon as ever I can get a copy of my book (77/2. \"The Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" London, 1859.) ready, in some six weeks' or two months' time,\r\nit shall be sent you; and if you approve of it, even to a moderate\r\nextent, it will be the highest satisfaction which I shall ever receive\r\nfor an amount of labour which no one will ever appreciate.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 78. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(78/1. The reference in the following letter is to the proofs of\r\nHooker's \"Australian Flora.\")\r\n\r\nDown, 28 [July 1859].\r\n\r\nThe returned sheet is chiefly that which I received in MS. Parts seem to\r\nme (though perhaps it may be forgetfulness) much improved, and I retain\r\nmy former impression that the whole discussion on the Australian flora\r\nis admirably good and original. I know you will understand and not\r\nobject to my thus expressing my opinion (for one must form one) so\r\npresumptuously. I have no criticisms, except perhaps I should like\r\nyou somewhere to say, when you refer to me, that you refer only to the\r\nnotice in the \"Linnean Journal;\" not that, on my deliberate word of\r\nhonour, I expect that you will think more favourably of the whole than\r\nof the suggestion in the \"Journal.\" I am far more than satisfied at what\r\nyou say of my work; yet it would be as well to avoid the appearance of\r\nyour remarks being a criticism on my fuller work.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to hear you are so hard-worked. I also get on very\r\nslowly, and have hardly as yet finished half my volume...I returned on\r\nlast Tuesday from a week's hydropathy.\r\n\r\nTake warning by me, and do not work too hard. For God's sake, think of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nIt is dreadfully uphill work with me getting my confounded volume\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nI wish you well through all your labours. Adios.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 79. TO ASA GRAY. Down, November 29th [1859].\r\n\r\nThis shall be such an extraordinary note as you have never received from\r\nme, for it shall not contain one single question or request. I thank you\r\nfor your impression on my views. Every criticism from a good man is of\r\nvalue to me. What you hint at generally is very, very true: that my work\r\nwill be grievously hypothetical, and large parts by no means worthy of\r\nbeing called induction, my commonest error being probably induction from\r\ntoo few facts. I had not thought of your objection of my using the term\r\n\"natural selection\" as an agent. I use it much as a geologist does the\r\nword denudation--for an agent, expressing the result of several combined\r\nactions. I will take care to explain, not merely by inference, what I\r\nmean by the term; for I must use it, otherwise I should incessantly have\r\nto expand it into some such (here miserably expressed) formula as\r\nthe following: \"The tendency to the preservation (owing to the severe\r\nstruggle for life to which all organic beings at some time or generation\r\nare exposed) of any, the slightest, variation in any part, which is of\r\nthe slightest use or favourable to the life of the individual which\r\nhas thus varied; together with the tendency to its inheritance.\" Any\r\nvariation, which was of no use whatever to the individual, would not be\r\npreserved by this process of \"natural selection.\" But I will not weary\r\nyou by going on, as I do not suppose I could make my meaning clearer\r\nwithout large expansion. I will only add one other sentence: several\r\nvarieties of sheep have been turned out together on the Cumberland\r\nmountains, and one particular breed is found to succeed so much better\r\nthan all the others that it fairly starves the others to death. I should\r\nhere say that natural selection picks out this breed, and would tend to\r\nimprove it, or aboriginally to have formed it...\r\n\r\nYou speak of species not having any material base to rest on, but is\r\nthis any greater hardship than deciding what deserves to be called a\r\nvariety, and be designated by a Greek letter? When I was at systematic\r\nwork, I know I longed to have no other difficulty (great enough) than\r\ndeciding whether the form was distinct enough to deserve a name, and not\r\nto be haunted with undefined and unanswerable questions whether it was a\r\ntrue species. What a jump it is from a well-marked variety, produced by\r\nnatural cause, to a species produced by the separate act of the hand\r\nof God! But I am running on foolishly. By the way, I met the other day\r\nPhillips, the palaeontologist, and he asked me, \"How do you define a\r\nspecies?\" I answered, \"I cannot.\" Whereupon he said, \"at last I have\r\nfound out the only true definition,--any form which has ever had a\r\nspecific name!\"...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 80. TO C. LYELL. Ilkley, October 31st [1859].\r\n\r\nThat you may not misunderstand how far I go with Pallas and his many\r\ndisciples I should like to add that, though I believe that our domestic\r\ndogs have descended from several wild forms, and though I must think\r\nthat the sterility, which they would probably have evinced, if crossed\r\nbefore being domesticated, has been eliminated, yet I go but a very\r\nlittle way with Pallas & Co. in their belief in the importance of\r\nthe crossing and blending of the aboriginal stocks. (80/1. \"With our\r\ndomesticated animals, the various races when crossed together are quite\r\nfertile; yet in many cases they are descended from two or more wild\r\nspecies. From this fact we must conclude either that the aboriginal\r\nparent-species at first produced perfectly fertile hybrids, or that the\r\nhybrids subsequently reared under domestication became quite fertile.\r\nThis latter alternative, which was first propounded by Pallas, seems by\r\nfar the most probable, and can, indeed, hardly be doubted\" (\"Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" Edition VI., page 240).) You will see this briefly put in the\r\nfirst chapter. Generally, with respect to crossing, the effects may be\r\ndiametrically opposite. If you cross two very distinct races, you may\r\nmake (not that I believe such has often been made) a third and new\r\nintermediate race; but if you cross two exceedingly close races, or two\r\nslightly different individuals of the same race, then in fact you annul\r\nand obliterate the difference. In this latter way I believe crossing is\r\nall-important, and now for twenty years I have been working at flowers\r\nand insects under this point of view. I do not like Hooker's terms,\r\ncentripetal and centrifugal (80/2. Hooker's \"Introductory Essay to the\r\nFlora of Tasmania,\" pages viii. and ix.): they remind me of Forbes' bad\r\nterm of Polarity. (80/3. Forbes, \"On the Manifestation of Polarity in\r\nthe Distribution of Organised Beings in Time.\"--\"R. Institution Proc.\"\r\nI., 1851-54.)\r\n\r\nI daresay selection by man would generally work quicker than Natural\r\nSelection; but the important distinction between them is, that man can\r\nscarcely select except external and visible characters, and secondly, he\r\nselects for his own good; whereas under nature, characters of all kinds\r\nare selected exclusively for each creature's own good, and are well\r\nexercised; but you will find all this in Chapter IV.\r\n\r\nAlthough the hound, greyhound, and bull-dog may possibly have descended\r\nfrom three distinct stocks, I am convinced that their present great\r\namount of difference is mainly due to the same causes which have made\r\nthe breeds of pigeons so different from each other, though these breeds\r\nof pigeons have all descended from one wild stock; so that the Pallasian\r\ndoctrine I look at as but of quite secondary importance.\r\n\r\nIn my bigger book I have explained my meaning fully; whether I have in\r\nthe Abstract I cannot remember.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 81. TO C. LYELL. [December 5th, 1859.]\r\n\r\nI forget whether you take in the \"Times;\" for the chance of your not\r\ndoing so, I send the enclosed rich letter. (81/1. See the \"Times,\"\r\nDecember 1st and December 5th, 1859: two letters signed \"Senex,\" dealing\r\nwith \"Works of Art in the Drift.\") It is, I am sure, by Fitz-Roy...It\r\nis a pity he did not add his theory of the extinction of Mastodon, etc.,\r\nfrom the door of the Ark being made too small. (81/2. A postscript to\r\nthis letter, here omitted, is published in the \"Life and Letters,\" II.,\r\npage 240.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 82. FRANCIS GALTON TO CHARLES DARWIN. 42, Rutland Gate, London,\r\nS.W., December 9th, 1859.\r\n\r\nPray let me add a word of congratulation on the completion of your\r\nwonderful volume, to those which I am sure you will have received from\r\nevery side. I have laid it down in the full enjoyment of a feeling that\r\none rarely experiences after boyish days, of having been initiated into\r\nan entirely new province of knowledge, which, nevertheless, connects\r\nitself with other things in a thousand ways. I hear you are engaged on a\r\nsecond edition. There is a trivial error in page 68, about rhinoceroses\r\n(82/1. Down (loc. cit.) says that neither the elephant nor the\r\nrhinoceros is destroyed by beasts of prey. Mr. Galton wrote that the\r\nwild dogs hunt the young rhinoceros and \"exhaust them to death; they\r\npursue them all day long, tearing at their ears, the only part their\r\nteeth can fasten on.\" The reference to the rhinoceros is omitted in\r\nlater editions of the \"Origin.\"), which I thought I might as well point\r\nout, and have taken advantage of the same opportunity to scrawl down\r\nhalf a dozen other notes, which may, or may not, be worthless to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n(83/1. The three next letters refer to Huxley's lecture on Evolution,\r\ngiven at the Royal Institution on February 10th, 1860, of which the\r\nperoration is given in \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 282, together with\r\nsome letters on the subject.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 83. TO T.H. HUXLEY. November 25th [1859].\r\n\r\nI rejoice beyond measure at the lecture. I shall be at home in a\r\nfortnight, when I could send you splendid folio coloured drawings of\r\npigeons. Would this be in time? If not, I think I could write to my\r\nservants and have them sent to you. If I do NOT hear I shall understand\r\nthat about fifteen or sixteen days will be in time.\r\n\r\nI have had a kind yet slashing letter against me from poor dear old\r\nSedgwick, \"who has laughed till his sides ached at my book.\"\r\n\r\nPhillips is cautious, but decidedly, I fear, hostile. Hurrah for the\r\nLecture--it is grand!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 84. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, December 13th [1859].\r\n\r\nI have got fine large drawings (84/1. For Mr. Huxley's R.I. lecture.)\r\nof the Pouter, Carrier, and Tumbler; I have only drawings in books of\r\nFantails, Barbs, and Scanderoon Runts. If you had them, you would have\r\na grand display of extremes of diversity. Will they pay at the Royal\r\nInstitution for copying on a large size drawings of these birds? I could\r\nlend skulls of a Carrier and a Tumbler (to show the great difference)\r\nfor the same purpose, but it would not probably be worth while.\r\n\r\nI have been looking at my MS. What you want I believe is about hybridism\r\nand breeding. The chapter on hybridism is in a pretty good state--about\r\n150 folio pages with notes and references on the back. My first\r\nchapter on breeding is in too bad and imperfect a state to send; but\r\nmy discussion on pigeons (in about 100 folio pages) is in a pretty good\r\nstate. I am perfectly convinced that you would never have patience to\r\nread such volumes of MS. I speak now in the palace of truth, and pray do\r\nyou: if you think you would read them I will send them willingly up by\r\nmy servant, or bring them myself next week. But I have no copy, and I\r\nnever could possibly replace them; and without you really thought that\r\nyou would use them, I had rather not risk them. But I repeat I will\r\nwillingly bring them, if you think you would have the vast patience to\r\nuse them. Please let me hear on this subject, and whether I shall send\r\nthe book with small drawings of three other breeds or skulls. I have\r\nheard a rumour that Busk is on our side in regard to species. Is this\r\nso? It would be very good.\r\n\r\nLETTER 85. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, December 16th [1859].\r\n\r\nI thank you for your very pleasant and amusing note and invitation\r\nto dinner, which I am sorry to say I cannot accept. I shall come up\r\n(stomach willing) on Thursday for Phil. Club dinner, and return on\r\nSaturday, and I am engaged to my brother for Friday. But I should very\r\nmuch like to call at the Museum on Friday or Saturday morning and see\r\nyou. Would you let me have one line either here or at 57, Queen Anne\r\nStreet, to say at what hour you generally come to the Museum, and\r\nwhether you will be probably there on Friday or Saturday? Even if you\r\nare at the Club, it will be a mere chance if we sit near each other.\r\n\r\nI will bring up the articles on Thursday afternoon, and leave them under\r\ncharge of the porter at the Museum. They will consist of large\r\ndrawings of a Pouter, a Carrier, and rather smaller drawings of some\r\nsub-varieties (which breed nearly true) of short-faced Tumblers. Also\r\na small drawing of Scanderoon, a kind of Runt, and a very remarkable\r\nbreed. Also a book with very moderately good drawings of Fantail and\r\nBarb, but I very much doubt whether worth the trouble of enlarging.\r\n\r\nAlso a box (for Heaven's sake, take care!) with a skull of Carrier and\r\nshort-faced Tumbler; also lower jaws (largest size) of Runt, middle\r\nsize of Rock-pigeon, and the broad one of Barb. The form of ramus of jaw\r\ndiffers curiously in these jaws.\r\n\r\nAlso MS. of hybridism and pigeons, which will just weary you to death.\r\nI will call myself for or send a servant for the MS. and bones whenever\r\nyou have done with them; but do not hurry.\r\n\r\nYou have hit on the exact plan, which, on the advice of Lyell, Murray,\r\netc., I mean to follow--viz., bring out separate volumes in detail--and\r\nI shall begin with domestic productions; but I am determined to try\r\nand [work] very slowly, so that, if possible, I may keep in a somewhat\r\nbetter state of health. I had not thought of illustrations; that\r\nis capital advice. Farewell, my good and admirable agent for the\r\npromulgation of damnable heresies!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 86. TO L. HORNER. Down, December 23rd [1859].\r\n\r\nI must have the pleasure of thanking you for your extremely kind letter.\r\nI am very much pleased that you approve of my book, and that you are\r\ngoing to pay me the extraordinary compliment of reading it twice. I fear\r\nthat it is tough reading, but it is beyond my powers to make the subject\r\nclearer. Lyell would have done it admirably.\r\n\r\nYou must enjoy being a gentlemen at your ease, and I hear that you have\r\nreturned with ardour to work at the Geological Society. We hope in the\r\ncourse of the winter to persuade Mrs. Horner and yourself and daughters\r\nto pay us a visit. Ilkley did me extraordinary good during the latter\r\npart of my stay and during my first week at home; but I have gone back\r\nlatterly to my bad ways, and fear I shall never be decently well and\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nP.S.--When any of your party write to Mildenhall I should be much\r\nobliged if you would say to Bunbury that I hope he will not forget,\r\nwhenever he reads my book, his promise to let me know what he thinks\r\nabout it; for his knowledge is so great and accurate that every one must\r\nvalue his opinions highly. I shall be quite contented if his belief in\r\nthe immutability of species is at all staggered.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 87. TO C. LYELL.\r\n\r\n(87/1. In the \"Origin of Species\" a section of Chapter X. is devoted to\r\n\"The succession of the same types within the same areas, during the late\r\nTertiary period\" (Edition I., page 339). Mr. Darwin wrote as follows:\r\n\"Mr. Clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the\r\nAustralian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of that\r\ncontinent.\" After citing other instances illustrating the same agreement\r\nbetween fossil and recent types, Mr. Darwin continues: \"I was so much\r\nimpressed with these facts that I strongly insisted, in 1839 and\r\n1845, on this 'law of the succession of types,' on 'this wonderful\r\nrelationship in the same continent between the dead and the living.'\r\nProfessor Owen has subsequently extended the same generalisation to the\r\nmammals of the Old World.\")\r\n\r\nDown, [December] 27th [1859].\r\n\r\nOwen wrote to me to ask for the reference to Clift. As my own notes\r\nfor the late chapters are all in chaos, I bethought me who was the most\r\ntrustworthy man of all others to look for references, and I answered\r\nmyself, \"Of course Lyell.\" In the [\"Principles of Geology\"], edition of\r\n1833, Volume III., chapter xi., page 144, you will find the reference to\r\nClift in the \"Edinburgh New Phil Journal,\" No. XX., page 394. (87/2. The\r\ncorrect reference to Clift's \"Report\" on fossil bones from New Holland\r\nis \"Edinburgh New Phil. Journal,\" 1831, page 394.) You will also find\r\nthat you were greatly struck with the fact itself (87/3. This refers to\r\nthe discovery of recent and fossil species of animals in an Australian\r\ncave-breccia. Mr. Clift is quoted as having identified one of the bones,\r\nwhich was much larger than the rest, as that of a hippopotamus.), which\r\nI had quite forgotten. I copied the passage, and sent it to Owen. Why\r\nI gave in some detail references to my own work is that Owen (not the\r\nfirst occasion with respect to myself and others) quietly ignores my\r\nhaving ever generalised on the subject, and makes a great fuss on more\r\nthan one occasion at having discovered the law of succession. In fact,\r\nthis law, with the Galapagos distribution, first turned my mind on the\r\norigin of species. My own references are [to the \"Naturalist's Voyage\"]:\r\n\r\n     Large 8vo,     Murray,\r\n     Edition 1839   Edition 1845\r\n\r\n     Page 210       Page 173        On succession.\r\n\r\n     Page 153       Pages 131-32    On splitting up of old\r\n                                    geographical provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before Owen published I had in MS. worked out the succession of\r\ntypes in the Old World (as I remember telling Sedgwick, who of course\r\ndisbelieved it).\r\n\r\nSince receiving your last letter on Hooker, I have read his introduction\r\nas far as page xxiv (87/4. \"On the Flora of Australia, etc.; being an\r\nIntroductory Essay to the Flora of Tasmania\": London, 1859.), where\r\nthe Australian flora begins, and this latter part I liked most in\r\nthe proofs. It is a magnificent essay. I doubt slightly about some\r\nassertions, or rather should have liked more facts--as, for instance, in\r\nregard to species varying most on the confines of their range. Naturally\r\nI doubt a little his remarks about divergence (87/5. \"Variation is\r\neffected by graduated changes; and the tendency of varieties, both in\r\nnature and under cultivation, when further varying, is rather to depart\r\nmore and more widely from the original type than to revert to it.\" On\r\nthe margin Darwin wrote: \"Without selection doubtful\" (loc. cit., page\r\nviii).), and about domestic races being produced under nature without\r\nselection. It would take much to persuade me that a Pouter Pigeon, or\r\na Carrier, etc., could have been produced by the mere laws of variation\r\nwithout long continued selection, though each little enlargement of crop\r\nand beak are due to variation. I demur greatly to his comparison of the\r\nproducts of sinking and rising islands (87/6. \"I venture to anticipate\r\nthat a study of the vegetation of the islands with reference to\r\nthe peculiarities of the generic types on the one hand, and of the\r\ngeological conditions (whether as rising or sinking) on the other,\r\nmay, in the present state of our knowledge, advance other subjects of\r\ndistribution and variation considerably\" (loc. cit., page xv).); in the\r\nIndian Ocean he compares exclusively many rising volcanic and sinking\r\ncoral islands. The latter have a most peculiar soil, and are excessively\r\nsmall in area, and are tenanted by very few species; moreover, such low\r\ncoral islands have probably been often, during their subsidence, utterly\r\nsubmerged, and restocked by plants from other islands. In the Pacific\r\nOcean the floras of all the best cases are unknown. The comparison ought\r\nto have been exclusively between rising and fringed volcanic islands,\r\nand sinking and encircled volcanic islands. I have read Naudin (87/7.\r\nNaudin, \"Revue Horticole,\" 1852?.), and Hooker agrees that he does not\r\neven touch on my views.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 88. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. [1859 or 1860.]\r\n\r\nI have had another talk with Bentham, who is greatly agitated by your\r\nbook: evidently the stern, keen intellect is aroused, and he finds that\r\nit is too late to halt between two opinions. How it will go we shall\r\nsee. I am intensely interested in what we shall come to, and never\r\nbroach the subject to him. I finished the geological evidence chapters\r\nyesterday; they are very fine and very striking, but I cannot see they\r\nare such forcible objections as you still hold them to be. I would say\r\nthat you still in your secret soul underrate the imperfection of the\r\nGeological Record, though no language can be stronger or arguments\r\nfairer and sounder against it. Of course I am influenced by Botany, and\r\nthe conviction that we have not in a fossilised condition a fraction of\r\nthe plants that have existed, and that not a fraction of those we have\r\nare recognisable specifically. I never saw so clearly put the fact that\r\nit is not intermediates between existing species we want, but between\r\nthese and the unknown tertium quid.\r\n\r\nYou certainly make a hobby of Natural Selection, and probably ride it\r\ntoo hard; that is a necessity of your case. If the improvement of\r\nthe creation-by-variation doctrine is conceivable, it will be by\r\nunburthening your theory of Natural Selection, which at first sight\r\nseems overstrained--i.e., to account for too much. I think, too, that\r\nsome of your difficulties which you override by Natural Selection may\r\ngive way before other explanations. But, oh Lord! how little we do\r\nknow and have known to be so advanced in knowledge by one theory. If we\r\nthought ourselves knowing dogs before you revealed Natural Selection,\r\nwhat d--d ignorant ones we must surely be now we do know that law.\r\n\r\nI hear you may be at the Club on Thursday. I hope so. Huxley will not be\r\nthere, so do not come on that ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 89. TO T.H. HUXLEY. January 1st [1860].\r\n\r\nI write one line merely to thank you for your pleasant note, and to say\r\nthat I will keep your secret. I will shake my head as mysteriously\r\nas Lord Burleigh. Several persons have asked me who wrote that \"most\r\nremarkable article\" in the \"Times.\" (89/1. The \"Times,\" December 26th,\r\n1859, page 8. The opening paragraphs were by one of the staff of\r\nthe \"Times.\" See \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 255, for Mr. Huxley's\r\ninteresting account of his share in the matter.) As a cat may look at a\r\nking, so I have said that I strongly suspected you. X was so sharp that\r\nthe first sentence revealed the authorship. The Z's (God save the\r\nmark) thought it was Owen's! You may rely on it that it has made a deep\r\nimpression, and I am heartily glad that the subject and I owe you\r\nthis further obligation. But for God's sake, take care of your health;\r\nremember that the brain takes years to rest, whilst the muscles take\r\nonly hours. There is poor Dana, to whom I used to preach by letter,\r\nwrites to me that my prophecies are come true: he is in Florence quite\r\ndone up, can read nothing and write nothing, and cannot talk for half an\r\nhour. I noticed the \"naughty sentence\" (89/2. Mr. Huxley, after speaking\r\nof the rudimental teeth of the whale, of rudimental jaws in insects\r\nwhich never bite, and rudimental eyes in blind animals, goes on: \"And\r\nwe would remind those who, ignorant of the facts, must be moved by\r\nauthority, that no one has asserted the incompetence of the doctrine\r\nof final causes, in its application to physiology and anatomy, more\r\nstrongly than our own eminent anatomist, Professor Owen, who, speaking\r\nof such cases, says (\"On the Nature of Limbs,\" pages 39, 40), 'I think\r\nit will be obvious that the principle of final adaptations fails to\r\nsatisfy all the conditions of the problem.'\"--\"The Times,\" December\r\n26th, 1859.) about Owen, though my wife saw its bearing first. Farewell\r\nyou best and worst of men!\r\n\r\nThat sentence about the bird and the fish dinners charmed us. Lyell\r\nwrote to me--style like yours.\r\n\r\nHave you seen the slashing article of December 26th in the \"Daily News,\"\r\nagainst my stealing from my \"master,\" the author of the \"Vestiges?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 90. TO J.L.A. DE QUATREFAGES. [Undated]\r\n\r\nHow I should like to know whether Milne Edwards has read the copy which\r\nI sent him, and whether he thinks I have made a pretty good case on\r\nour side of the question. There is no naturalist in the world for whose\r\nopinion I have so profound a respect. Of course I am not so silly as to\r\nexpect to change his opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 91. TO C. LYELL.\r\n\r\n(91/1. The date of this letter is doubtful; but as it evidently refers\r\nto the 2nd edition of the \"Origin,\" which appeared on January 7th, 1860,\r\nwe believe that December 9th, 1859, is right. The letter of Sedgwick's\r\nis doubtless that given in the \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 247; it is\r\nthere dated December 24th, 1859, but from other evidence it was probably\r\nwritten on November 24th)\r\n\r\n[December?] 9th [1859].\r\n\r\nI send Sedgwick's letter; it is terribly muddled, and really the first\r\npage seems almost childish.\r\n\r\nI am sadly over-worked, so will not write to you. I have worked in\r\na number of your invaluable corrections--indeed, all as far as time\r\npermits. I infer from a letter from Huxley that Ramsay (91/2. See a\r\nletter to Huxley, November 27th, 1859, \"Life and Letters,\" II., page\r\n282.) is a convert, and I am extremely glad to get pure geologists, as\r\nthey will be very few. Many thanks for your very pleasant note. What\r\npleasure you have given me. I believe I should have been miserable had\r\nit not been for you and a few others, for I hear threatening of attacks\r\nwhich I daresay will be severe enough. But I am sure that I can now bear\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 92. TO T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n(92/1. The point here discussed is one to which Mr. Huxley attached\r\ngreat, in our opinion too great, importance.)\r\n\r\nDown, January 11th [1860?].\r\n\r\nI fully agree that the difficulty is great, and might be made much of by\r\na mere advocate. Will you oblige me by reading again slowly from pages\r\n267 to 272. (92/2. The reference is to the \"Origin,\" Edition I.: the\r\nsection on \"The Fertility of Varieties when crossed, and of their\r\nMongrel Offspring\" occupies pages 267-72.) I may add to what is there\r\nsaid, that it seems to me quite hopeless to attempt to explain why\r\nvarieties are not sterile, until we know the precise cause of sterility\r\nin species.\r\n\r\nReflect for a moment on how small and on what very peculiar causes the\r\nunequal reciprocity of fertility in the same two species must depend.\r\nReflect on the curious case of species more fertile with foreign pollen\r\nthan their own. Reflect on many cases which could be given, and shall\r\nbe given in my larger book (independently of hybridity) of very slight\r\nchanges of conditions causing one species to be quite sterile and not\r\naffecting a closely allied species. How profoundly ignorant we are on\r\nthe intimate relation between conditions of life and impaired fertility\r\nin pure species!\r\n\r\nThe only point which I might add to my short discussion on this subject,\r\nis that I think it probable that the want of adaptation to uniform\r\nconditions of life in our domestic varieties has played an important\r\npart in preventing their acquiring sterility when crossed. For the want\r\nof uniformity, and changes in the conditions of life, seem the\r\nonly cause of the elimination of sterility (when crossed) under\r\ndomestication. (92/3. The meaning which we attach to this obscure\r\nsentence is as follows: Species in a state of nature are closely adapted\r\nto definite conditions of life, so that the sexual constitution of\r\nspecies A is attuned, as it were, to a condition different from that to\r\nwhich B is attuned, and this leads to sterility. But domestic varieties\r\nare not strictly adapted by Natural Selection to definite conditions,\r\nand thus have less specialised sexual constitutions.) This elimination,\r\nthough admitted by many authors, rests on very slight evidence, yet I\r\nthink is very probably true, as may be inferred from the case of\r\ndogs. Under nature it seems improbable that the differences in the\r\nreproductive constitution, on which the sterility of any two species\r\nwhen crossed depends, can be acquired directly by Natural Selection; for\r\nit is of no advantage to the species. Such differences in reproductive\r\nconstitution must stand in correlation with some other differences; but\r\nhow impossible to conjecture what these are! Reflect on the case of\r\nthe variations of Verbascum, which differ in no other respect whatever\r\nbesides the fluctuating element of the colour of the flower, and yet it\r\nis impossible to resist Gartner's evidence, that this difference in the\r\ncolour does affect the mutual fertility of the varieties.\r\n\r\nThe whole case seems to me far too mysterious to rest (92/4. The word\r\n\"rest\" seems to be used in place of \"to serve as a foundation for.\") a\r\nvalid attack on the theory of modification of species, though, as you\r\nsay, it offers excellent ground for a mere advocate.\r\n\r\nI am surprised, considering how ignorant we are on very many points,\r\n[that] more weak parts in my book have not as yet been pointed out to\r\nme. No doubt many will be. H.C. Watson founds his objection in MS. on\r\nthere being no limit to infinite diversification of species: I have\r\nanswered this, I think, satisfactorily, and have sent attack and answer\r\nto Lyell and Hooker. If this seems to you a good objection, I would\r\nsend papers to you. Andrew Murray \"disposes of\" the whole theory by an\r\ningenious difficulty from the distribution of blind cave insects (92/5.\r\nSee \"Life and Letters, Volume II., page 265. The reference here is to\r\nMurray's address before the Botanical Society, Edinburgh. Mr. Darwin\r\nseems to have read Murray's views only in a separate copy reprinted from\r\nthe \"Proc. R. Soc. Edin.\" There is some confusion about the date of the\r\npaper; the separate copy is dated January 16th, while in the volume of\r\nthe \"Proc. R. Soc.\" it is February 20th. In the \"Life and Letters,\" II.,\r\npage 261 it is erroneously stated that these are two different papers.);\r\nbut it can, I think, be fairly answered.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 93. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, [February] 2nd [1860].\r\n\r\nI have had this morning a letter from old Bronn (93/1. See \"Life and\r\nLetters, II., page 277.) (who, to my astonishment, seems slightly\r\nstaggered by Natural Selection), and he says a publisher in Stuttgart is\r\nwilling to publish a translation, and that he, Bronn, will to a certain\r\nextent superintend. Have you written to Kolliker? if not, perhaps I had\r\nbetter close with this proposal--what do you think? If you have written,\r\nI must wait, and in this case will you kindly let me hear as soon as you\r\nhear from Kolliker?\r\n\r\nMy poor dear friend, you will curse the day when you took up the\r\n\"general agency\" line; but really after this I will not give you any\r\nmore trouble.\r\n\r\nDo not forget the three tickets for us for your lecture, and the ticket\r\nfor Baily, the poulterer.\r\n\r\nOld Bronn has published in the \"Year-book for Mineralogy\" a notice of\r\nthe \"Origin\" (93/2. \"Neues Jahrb. fur Min.\" 1860, page 112.); and says\r\nhe has himself published elsewhere a foreboding of the theory!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 94. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, February 14th [1860].\r\n\r\nI succeeded in persuading myself for twenty-four hours that Huxley's\r\nlecture was a success. (94/1. At the Royal Institution. See \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" II., page 282.) Parts were eloquent and good, and all very\r\nbold; and I heard strangers say, \"What a good lecture!\" I told Huxley\r\nso; but I demurred much to the time wasted in introductory remarks,\r\nespecially to his making it appear that sterility was a clear and\r\nmanifest distinction of species, and to his not having even alluded to\r\nthe more important parts of the subject. He said that he had much more\r\nwritten out, but time failed. After conversation with others and more\r\nreflection, I must confess that as an exposition of the doctrine the\r\nlecture seems to me an entire failure. I thank God I did not think so\r\nwhen I saw Huxley; for he spoke so kindly and magnificently of me, that\r\nI could hardly have endured to say what I now think. He gave no just\r\nidea of Natural Selection. I have always looked at the doctrine of\r\nNatural Selection as an hypothesis, which, if it explained several\r\nlarge classes of facts, would deserve to be ranked as a theory deserving\r\nacceptance; and this, of course, is my own opinion. But, as Huxley\r\nhas never alluded to my explanation of classification, morphology,\r\nembryology, etc., I thought he was thoroughly dissatisfied with all this\r\npart of my book. But to my joy I find it is not so, and that he agrees\r\nwith my manner of looking at the subject; only that he rates higher than\r\nI do the necessity of Natural Selection being shown to be a vera\r\ncausa always in action. He tells me he is writing a long review in the\r\n\"Westminster.\" It was really provoking how he wasted time over the idea\r\nof a species as exemplified in the horse, and over Sir J. Hall's old\r\nexperiment on marble. Murchison was very civil to me over my book after\r\nthe lecture, in which he was disappointed. I have quite made up my mind\r\nto a savage onslaught; but with Lyell, you, and Huxley, I feel confident\r\nwe are right, and in the long run shall prevail. I do not think Asa Gray\r\nhas quite done you justice in the beginning of the review of me. (94/2.\r\n\"Review of Darwin's Theory on the Origin of Species by means of Natural\r\nSelection,\" by \"A.G.\" (\"Amer. Jour. Sci.\" Volume XXIX., page 153, 1860).\r\nIn a letter to Asa Gray on February 18th, 1860, Darwin writes: \"Your\r\nreview seems to me admirable; by far the best which I have read.\" (\"Life\r\nand Letters,\" II., 1887, page 286.) The review seemed to me very good,\r\nbut I read it very hastily.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 95. TO C. LYELL. Down, [February] 18th [1860].\r\n\r\nI send by this post Asa Gray, which seems to me very good, with the\r\nstamp of originality on it. Also Bronn's \"Jahrbuch fur Mineralogie.\"\r\n(95/1. See Letter 93.)\r\n\r\nThe united intellect of my family has vainly tried to make it out. I\r\nnever tried such confoundedly hard german; nor does it seem worth the\r\nlabour. He sticks to Priestley's Green Matter, and seems to think that\r\ntill it can be shown how life arises it is no good showing how the forms\r\nof life arise. This seems to me about as logical (comparing very great\r\nthings with little) as to say it was no use in Newton showing the laws\r\nof attraction of gravity and the consequent movement of the planets,\r\nbecause he could not show what the attraction of gravity is.\r\n\r\nThe expression \"Wahl der Lebens-Weise\" (95/2. \"Die fruchtbarste und\r\nallgemeinste Ursache der Varietaten-Bildung ist jedoch die Wahl\r\nder Lebens-Weise\" (loc. cit., page 112).) makes me doubt whether B.\r\nunderstands what I mean by Natural Selection, as I have told him. He\r\nsays (if I understand him) that you ought to be on the same side with\r\nme.\r\n\r\nP.S. Sunday afternoon.--I have kept back this to thank you for your\r\nletter, with much news, received this morning. My conscience is uneasy\r\nat the time you waste in amusing and interesting me. I was very\r\ncurious to hear about Phillips. The review in the \"Annals\" is, as I was\r\nconvinced, by Wollaston, for I have had a very cordial letter from him\r\nthis morning. (95/3. A bibliographical Notice \"On the Origin of Species\r\nby means of Natural Selection; or the Preservation of Favoured Races\r\nin the Struggle for Life.\" (\"Annals and Mag.\" Volume V., pages 132-43,\r\n1860). The notice is not signed. Referring to the article, in a\r\nletter to Lyell, February 15th, 1860, Darwin writes: \"I am perfectly\r\nconvinced...that the review in the \"Annals\" is by Wollaston; no one else\r\nin the world would have used so many parentheses\" (\"Life and Letters,\"\r\nII., page 284).)\r\n\r\nI send by this post an attack in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" by Harvey\r\n(a first-rate botanist, as you probably know). (95/4. In the \"Gardeners'\r\nChronicle\" of February 18th, 1860, W.H. Harvey described a case of\r\nmonstrosity in Begonia frigida, which he argued was hostile to the\r\ntheory of Natural Selection. The passage about Harvey's attack was\r\npublished in the \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 275.) It seems to me\r\nrather strange; he assumes the permanence of monsters, whereas monsters\r\nare generally sterile, and not often inheritable. But grant his case,\r\nit comes [to this], that I have been too cautious in not admitting great\r\nand sudden variations. Here again comes in the mischief of my abstract.\r\nIn fuller MS. I have discussed the parallel case of a normal fish like a\r\nmonstrous gold-fish.\r\n\r\nI end my discussion by doubting, because all cases of monstrosities\r\nwhich resemble normal structures which I could find were not in allied\r\ngroups. Trees like Aspicarpa (95/5. Aspicarpa, an American genus of\r\nMalpighiaceae, is quoted in the \"Origin\" (Edition VI., page 367) as an\r\nillustration of Linnaeus' aphorism that the characters do not give\r\nthe genus, but the genus gives the characters. During several years'\r\ncultivation in France Aspicarpa produced only degraded flowers, which\r\ndiffered in many of the most important points of structure from the\r\nproper type of the order; but it was recognised by M. Richard that the\r\ngenus should be retained among the Malpighiaceae. \"This case,\" adds\r\nDarwin, \"well illustrates the spirit of our classification.\"), with\r\nflowers of two kinds (in the \"Origin\"), led me also to speculate on the\r\nsame subject; but I could find only one doubtfully analogous case of\r\nspecies having flowers like the degraded or monstrous flowers. Harvey\r\ndoes not see that if only a few (as he supposes) of the seedlings\r\ninherited being monstrosities, Natural Selection would be necessary\r\nto select and preserve them. You had better return the \"Gardeners'\r\nChronicle,\" etc., to my brother's. The case of Begonia (95/6. Harvey's\r\ncriticism was answered by Sir J.D. Hooker in the following number of the\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle\" (February 25th, 1860, page 170).) in itself is\r\nvery curious; I am tempted to answer the notice, but I will refrain, for\r\nthere would be no end to answers.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your objection of a multitude of still living simple\r\nforms, I have not discussed it anywhere in the \"Origin,\" though I have\r\noften thought it over. What you say about progress being only occasional\r\nand retrogression not uncommon, I agree to; only that in the animal\r\nkingdom I greatly doubt about retrogression being common. I have always\r\nput it to myself--What advantage can we see in an infusory animal, or an\r\nintestinal worm, or coral polypus, or earthworm being highly developed?\r\nIf no advantage, they would not become highly developed: not but what\r\nall these animals have very complex structures (except infusoria), and\r\nthey may well be higher than the animals which occupied similar places\r\nin the economy of nature before the Silurian epoch. There is a blind\r\nsnake with the appearances and, in some respects, habits of earthworms;\r\nbut this blind snake does not tend, as far as we can see, to replace and\r\ndrive out worms. I think I must in a future edition discuss a few more\r\nsuch points, and will introduce this and H.C. Watson's objection about\r\nthe infinite number of species and the general rise in organisation. But\r\nthere is a directly opposite objection to yours which is very difficult\r\nto answer--viz. how at the first start of life, when there were only\r\nthe simplest organisms, how did any complication of organisation profit\r\nthem? I can only answer that we have not facts enough to guide any\r\nspeculation on the subject.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Lepidosiren, Ganoid fishes, perhaps Ornithorhynchus, I\r\nsuspect, as stated in the \"Origin,\" (95/7. \"Origin of Species\" (Edition\r\nVI.), page 83.), that they have been preserved, from inhabiting\r\nfresh-water and isolated parts of the world, in which there has been\r\nless competition and less rapid progress in Natural Selection, owing\r\nto the fewness of individuals which can inhabit small areas; and where\r\nthere are few individuals variation at most must be slower. There are\r\nseveral allusions to this notion in the \"Origin,\" as under Amblyopsis,\r\nthe blind cave-fish (95/8. \"Origin,\" page 112.), and under Heer (95/9.\r\n\"Origin,\" page 83.) about Madeira plants resembling the fossil and\r\nextinct plants of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 96. TO JAMES LAMONT. Down, March 5th [1860?].\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your long and interesting letter. You have indeed\r\ngood right to speak confidently about the habits of wild birds and\r\nanimals; for I should think no one beside yourself has ever sported in\r\nSpitzbergen and Southern Africa. It is very curious and interesting\r\nthat you should have arrived at the conclusion that so-called \"Natural\r\nSelection\" had been efficient in giving their peculiar colours to our\r\ngrouse. I shall probably use your authority on the similar habits of our\r\ngrouse and the Norwegian species.\r\n\r\nI am particularly obliged for your very curious fact of the effect\r\nproduced by the introduction of the lowland grouse on the wildness of\r\nthe grouse in your neighbourhood. It is a very striking instance of what\r\ncrossing will do in affecting the character of a breed. Have you ever\r\nseen it stated in any sporting work that game has become wilder in this\r\ncountry? I wish I could get any sort of proof of the fact, for your\r\nexplanation seems to me equally ingenious and probable. I have myself\r\nwitnessed in South America a nearly parallel [case] with that which\r\nyou mention in regard to the reindeer in Spitzbergen, with the Cervus\r\ncampestris of La Plata. It feared neither man nor the sound of shot of\r\na rifle, but was terrified at the sight of a man on horseback; every one\r\nin that country always riding. As you are so great a sportsman, perhaps\r\nyou will kindly look to one very trifling point for me, as my neighbours\r\nhere think it too absurd to notice--namely, whether the feet of birds\r\nare dirty, whether a few grains of dirt do not adhere occasionally to\r\ntheir feet. I especially want to know how this is in the case of birds\r\nlike herons and waders, which stalk in the mud. You will guess that this\r\nrelates to dispersal of seeds, which is one of my greatest difficulties.\r\nMy health is very indifferent, and I am seldom able to attend the\r\nscientific meetings, but I sincerely hope that I may some time have the\r\npleasure of meeting you.\r\n\r\nPray accept my cordial thanks for your very kind letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 97. TO G.H.K. THWAITES. Down, March 21st [1860].\r\n\r\nI thank you very sincerely for your letter, and am much pleased that you\r\ngo a little way with me. You will think it presumptuous, but I am well\r\nconvinced from my own mental experience that if you keep the subject at\r\nall before your mind you will ultimately go further. The present volume\r\nis a mere abstract, and there are great omissions. One main one, which\r\nI have rectified in the foreign editions, is an explanation (which has\r\nsatisfied Lyell, who made the same objection with you) why many forms do\r\nnot progress or advance (and I quite agree about some retrograding). I\r\nhave also a MS. discussion on beauty; but do you really suppose that for\r\ninstance Diatomaceae were created beautiful that man, after millions of\r\ngenerations, should admire them through the microscope? (97/1. Thwaites\r\n(1811-82) published several papers on the Diatomaceae (\"On Conjugation\r\nin the Diatomaceae,\" \"Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist.\" Volume XX., 1847, pages\r\n9-11, 343-4; \"Further Observations on the Diatomaceae,\" loc. cit., 1848,\r\npage 161). See \"Life and Letters\" II., page 292.) I should attribute\r\nmost of such structures to quite unknown laws of growth; and mere\r\nrepetition of parts is to our eyes one main element of beauty. When any\r\nstructure is of use (and I can show what curiously minute particulars\r\nare often of highest use), I can see with my prejudiced eyes no limit to\r\nthe perfection of the coadaptations which could be effected by Natural\r\nSelection. I rather doubt whether you see how far, as it seems to me,\r\nthe argument for homology and embryology may be carried. I do not look\r\nat this as mere analogy. I would as soon believe that fossil shells were\r\nmere mockeries of real shells as that the same bones in the foot of a\r\ndog and wing of a bat, or the similar embryo of mammal and bird, had\r\nnot a direct signification, and that the signification can be unity of\r\ndescent or nothing. But I venture to repeat how much pleased I am that\r\nyou go some little way with me. I find a number of naturalists do\r\nthe same, and as their halting-places are various, and I must think\r\narbitrary, I believe they will all go further. As for changing at once\r\none's opinion, I would not value the opinion of a man who could do so;\r\nit must be a slow process. (97/2. Darwin wrote to Woodward in regard to\r\nthe \"Origin\": \"It may be a vain and silly thing to say, but I believe\r\nmy book must be read twice carefully to be fully understood. You will\r\nperhaps think it by no means worth the labour.\") Thank you for telling\r\nme about the Lantana (97/3. An exotic species of Lantana (Verbenaceae)\r\ngrows vigorously in Ceylon, and is described as frequently making its\r\nappearance after the firing of the low-country forests (see H.H.W.\r\nPearson, \"The Botany of the Ceylon Patanas,\" \"Journal Linn. Soc.\" Volume\r\nXXXIV., page 317, 1899). No doubt Thwaites' letter to Darwin referred\r\nto the spreading of the introduced Lantana, comparable to that of the\r\ncardoon in La Plata and of other plants mentioned by Darwin in the\r\n\"Origin of Species\" (Edition VI., page 51).), and I should at any time\r\nbe most grateful for any information which you think would be of use\r\nto me. I hope that you will publish a list of all naturalised plants\r\nin Ceylon, as far as known, carefully distinguishing those confined to\r\ncultivated soils alone. I feel sure that this most important subject has\r\nbeen greatly undervalued.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 98. TO T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n(98/1. The reference here is to the review on the \"Origin of Species\"\r\ngenerally believed to be by the late Sir R. Owen, and published in\r\nthe April number of the \"Edinburgh Review,\" 1860. Owen's biographer\r\nis silent on the subject, and prints, without comment, the following\r\npassage in an undated letter from Sedgwick to Owen: \"Do you know who was\r\nthe author of the article in the \"Edinburgh\" on the subject of Darwin's\r\ntheory? On the whole, I think it very good. I once suspected that you\r\nmust have had a hand in it, and I then abandoned that thought. I have\r\nnot read it with any care\" (Owen's \"Life,\" Volume II., page 96).\r\n\r\nApril 9th [1860].\r\n\r\nI never saw such an amount of misrepresentation. At page 530 (98/2.\r\n\"Lasting and fruitful conclusions have, indeed, hitherto been based\r\nonly on the possession of knowledge; now we are called upon to accept an\r\nhypothesis on the plea of want of knowledge. The geological record,\r\nit is averred, is so imperfect!\"--\"Edinburgh Review,\" CXI., 1860, page\r\n530.) he says we are called on to accept the hypothesis on the plea of\r\nignorance, whereas I think I could not have made it clearer that I admit\r\nthe imperfection of the Geological Record as a great difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe quotation (98/3. \"We are appealed to, or at least 'the young and\r\nrising naturalists with plastic minds,* [On the Nature of the Limbs,\r\npage 482] are adjured.\" It will be seen that the inverted comma after\r\n\"naturalists\" is omitted; the asterisk referring, in a footnote (here\r\nplaced in square brackets), to page 482 of the \"Origin,\" seems to\r\nhave been incorrectly assumed by Mr. Darwin to show the close of the\r\nquotation.--Ibid., page 512.) on page 512 of the \"Review\" about \"young\r\nand rising naturalists with plastic minds,\" attributed to \"nature of\r\nlimbs,\" is a false quotation, as I do not use the words \"plastic minds.\"\r\n\r\nAt page 501 (98/4. The passage (\"Origin,\" Edition I., page 483) begins,\r\n\"But do they really believe...,\" and shows clearly that the author\r\nconsiders such a belief all but impossible.) the quotation is garbled,\r\nfor I only ask whether naturalists believe about elemental atoms\r\nflashing, etc., and he changes it into that I state that they do\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nAt page 500 (98/5. \"All who have brought the transmutation speculation\r\nto the test of observed facts and ascertained powers in organic life,\r\nand have published the results, usually adverse to such speculations,\r\nare set down by Mr. Darwin as 'curiously illustrating the blindness of\r\npreconceived opinion.'\" The passage in the \"Origin,\" page 482, begins\r\nby expressing surprise at the point of view of some naturalists: \"They\r\nadmit that a multitude of forms, which till lately they themselves\r\nthought were special creations,...have been produced by variation, but\r\nthey refuse to extend the same view to other and very slightly\r\ndifferent forms...They admit variation as a vera causa in one case, they\r\narbitrarily reject it in another, without assigning any distinction in\r\nthe two cases. The day will come when this will be given as a curious\r\nillustration of the blindness of preconceived opinion.\") it is very\r\nfalse to say that I imply by \"blindness of preconceived opinion\" the\r\nsimple belief of creation. And so on in other cases. But I beg pardon\r\nfor troubling you. I am heartily sorry that in your unselfish endeavours\r\nto spread what you believe to be truth, you should have incurred so\r\nbrutal an attack. (98/6. The \"Edinburgh\" Reviewer, referring to Huxley's\r\nRoyal Institution Lecture given February 10th, 1860, \"On Species and\r\nRaces and their Origin,\" says (page 521), \"We gazed with amazement at\r\nthe audacity of the dispenser of the hour's intellectual amusement,\r\nwho, availing himself of the technical ignorance of the majority of his\r\nauditors, sought to blind them as to the frail foundations of 'natural\r\nselection' by such illustrations as the subjoined\": And then follows\r\na critique of the lecturer's comparison of the supposed descent of\r\nthe horse from the Palaeothere with that of various kinds of domestic\r\npigeons from the Rock-pigeon.) And now I will not think any more of this\r\nfalse and malignant attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 99. TO MAXWELL MASTERS. Down, April 13th [1860].\r\n\r\nI thank you very sincerely for your two kind notes. The next time you\r\nwrite to your father I beg you to give him from me my best thanks, but I\r\nam sorry that he should have had the trouble of writing when ill. I have\r\nbeen much interested by the facts given by him. If you think he would\r\nin the least care to hear the result of an artificial cross of two sweet\r\npeas, you can send the enclosed; if it will only trouble him, tear it\r\nup. There seems to be so much parallelism in the kind of variation from\r\nmy experiment, which was certainly a cross, and what Mr. Masters has\r\nobserved, that I cannot help suspecting that his peas were crossed by\r\nbees, which I have seen well dusted with the pollen of the sweet pea;\r\nbut then I wish this, and how hard it is to prevent one's wish biassing\r\none's judgment!\r\n\r\nI was struck with your remark about the Compositae, etc. I do not see\r\nthat it bears much against me, and whether it does or not is of\r\ncourse of not the slightest importance. Although I fully agree that\r\nno definition can be drawn between monstrosities and slight variations\r\n(such as my theory requires), yet I suspect there is some distinction.\r\nSome facts lead me to think that monstrosities supervene generally at\r\nan early age; and after attending to the subject I have great doubts\r\nwhether species in a state of nature ever become modified by such sudden\r\njumps as would result from the Natural Selection of monstrosities. You\r\ncannot do me a greater service than by pointing out errors. I sincerely\r\nhope that your work on monstrosities (99/1. \"Vegetable Teratology,\"\r\nLondon, 1869 (Ray Soc.).) will soon appear, for I am sure it will be\r\nhighly instructive.\r\n\r\nNow for your notes, for which let me again thank you.\r\n\r\n1. Your conclusion about parts developed (99/2. See \"Origin of Species,\"\r\nEdition I., page 153, on the variability of parts \"developed in an\r\nextraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other species\r\nof the same genus.\" See \"Life and Letters,\" II., pages 97, 98, also\r\nLetter 33.) not being extra variable agrees with Hooker's. You will see\r\nthat I have stated that the rule apparently does not hold with plants,\r\nthough it ought, if true, to hold good with them.\r\n\r\n2. I cannot now remember in what work I saw the statement about Peloria\r\naffecting the axis, but I know it was one which I thought might be\r\ntrusted. I consulted also Dr. Falconer, and I think that he agreed to\r\nthe truth of it; but I cannot now tell where to look for my notes. I had\r\nbeen much struck with finding a Laburnum tree with the terminal\r\nflowers alone in each raceme peloric, though not perfectly regular. The\r\nPelargonium case in the \"Origin\" seems to point in the same direction.\r\n(99/3. \"Origin of Species,\" Edition I., page 145.)\r\n\r\n3. Thanks for the correction about furze: I found the seedlings just\r\nsprouting, and was so much surprised and their appearance that I sent\r\nthem to Hooker; but I never plainly asked myself whether they were\r\ncotyledons or first leaves. (99/4. The trifoliate leaves of furze\r\nseedlings are not cotyledons, but early leaves: see Lubbock's\r\n\"Seedlings,\" I., page 410.)\r\n\r\n4. That is a curious fact about the seeds of the furze, the more curious\r\nas I found with Leguminosae that immersion in plain cold water for a\r\nvery few days killed some kinds.\r\n\r\nIf at any time anything should occur to you illustrating or opposing my\r\nnotions, and you have leisure to inform me, I should be truly grateful,\r\nfor I can plainly see that you have wealth of knowledge.\r\n\r\nWith respect to advancement or retrogression in organisation in\r\nmonstrosities of the Compositae, etc., do you not find it very difficult\r\nto define which is which?\r\n\r\nAnyhow, most botanists seem to differ as widely as possible on this\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 100. TO J.S. HENSLOW. Down, May 8th [1860].\r\n\r\nVery many thanks about the Elodea, which case interests me much. I\r\nwrote to Mr. Marshall (100/1. W. Marshall was the author of \"Anacharis\r\nalsinastrum, a new water-weed\": four letters to the \"Cambridge\r\nIndependent Press,\" reprinted as a pamphlet, 1852.) at Ely, and in due\r\ntime he says he will send me whatever information he can procure.\r\n\r\nOwen is indeed very spiteful. (100/2. Owen was believed to be the author\r\nof the article in the \"Edinburgh Review,\" April, 1860. See Letter 98.)\r\nHe misrepresents and alters what I say very unfairly. But I think his\r\nconduct towards Hooker most ungenerous: viz., to allude to his essay\r\n(Australian Flora), and not to notice the magnificent results on\r\ngeographical distribution. The Londoners say he is mad with envy because\r\nmy book has been talked about; what a strange man to be envious of a\r\nnaturalist like myself, immeasurably his inferior! From one conversation\r\nwith him I really suspect he goes at the bottom of his hidden soul as\r\nfar as I do.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether Sedgwick noticed in the \"Edinburgh Review\" about\r\nthe \"Sacerdotal revilers,\"--so the revilers are tearing each other\r\nto pieces. I suppose Sedgwick will be very fierce against me at the\r\nPhilosophical Society. (100/3. The meeting of the \"Cambridge Phil.\r\nSoc.\" was held on May 7th, 1860, and fully reported in the \"Cambridge\r\nChronicle,\" May 19th. Sedgwick is reported to have said that \"Darwin's\r\ntheory is not inductive--is not based on a series of acknowledged\r\nfacts, leading to a general conclusion evolved, logically out of the\r\nfacts...The only facts he pretends to adduce, as true elements of\r\nproof, are the varieties produced by domestication and the artifices\r\nof crossbreeding.\" Sedgwick went on to speak of the vexatious\r\nmultiplication of supposed species, and adds, \"In this respect Darwin's\r\ntheory may help to simplify our classifications, and thereby do good\r\nservice to modern science. But he has not undermined any grand truth\r\nin the constancy of natural laws, and the continuity of true species.\")\r\nJudging from his notice in the \"Spectator,\" (100/4. March 24th, 1860;\r\nsee \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 297.) he will misrepresent me, but it\r\nwill certainly be unintentionally done. In a letter to me, and in\r\nthe above notice, he talks much about my departing from the spirit of\r\ninductive philosophy. I wish, if you ever talk on the subject to him,\r\nyou would ask him whether it was not allowable (and a great step) to\r\ninvent the undulatory theory of light, i.e. hypothetical undulations,\r\nin a hypothetical substance, the ether. And if this be so, why may I not\r\ninvent the hypothesis of Natural Selection (which from the analogy\r\nof domestic productions, and from what we know of the struggle for\r\nexistence and of the variability of organic beings, is, in some very\r\nslight degree, in itself probable) and try whether this hypothesis of\r\nNatural Selection does not explain (as I think it does) a large\r\nnumber of facts in geographical distribution--geological succession,\r\nclassification, morphology, embryology, etc. I should really much like\r\nto know why such an hypothesis as the undulation of the ether may be\r\ninvented, and why I may not invent (not that I did invent it, for I\r\nwas led to it by studying domestic varieties) any hypothesis, such as\r\nNatural Selection.\r\n\r\nPray forgive me and my pen for running away with me, and scribbling on\r\nat such length.\r\n\r\nI can perfectly understand Sedgwick (100/5. See \"Life and Letters,\" II.,\r\npage 247; the letter is there dated December 24th, but must, we think,\r\nhave been written in November at latest.) or any one saying that Natural\r\nSelection does not explain large classes of facts; but that is very\r\ndifferent from saying that I depart from right principles of scientific\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 101. TO J.S. HENSLOW. Down, May 14th [1860].\r\n\r\nI have been greatly interested by your letter to Hooker, and I must\r\nthank you from my heart for so generously defending me, as far as you\r\ncould, against my powerful attackers. Nothing which persons say hurts\r\nme for long, for I have an entire conviction that I have not been\r\ninfluenced by bad feelings in the conclusions at which I have arrived.\r\nNor have I published my conclusions without long deliberation, and they\r\nwere arrived at after far more study than the public will ever know of,\r\nor believe in. I am certain to have erred in many points, but I do not\r\nbelieve so much as Sedgwick and Co. think.\r\n\r\nIs there any Abstract or Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical\r\nSociety published? (101/1. Henslow's remarks are not given in the\r\nabove-mentioned report in the \"Cambridge Chronicle.\") If so, and you\r\ncould get me a copy, I should like to have one.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Henslow, I feel grateful to you on this occasion,\r\nand for the multitude of kindnesses you have done me from my earliest\r\ndays at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 102. TO C. LYELL. Down, May 22nd [1860].\r\n\r\nHooker has sent me a letter of Thwaites (102/1. See Letter 97.), of\r\nCeylon, who makes exactly the same objections which you did at first\r\nabout the necessity of all forms advancing, and therefore the difficulty\r\nof simple forms still existing. There was no worse omission than this in\r\nmy book, and I had the discussion all ready.\r\n\r\nI am extremely glad to hear that you intend adding new arguments about\r\nthe imperfection of the Geological Record. I always feel this acutely,\r\nand am surprised that such men as Ramsay and Jukes do not feel it more.\r\n\r\nI quite agree on insufficient evidence about mummy wheat. (102/2. See\r\nnotes appended to a letter to Lyell, September 1843 (Botany).\r\n\r\nWhen you can spare it, I should like (but out of mere curiosity) to see\r\nBinney on Coal marine marshes.\r\n\r\nI once made Hooker very savage by saying that I believed the Coal plants\r\ngrew in the sea, like mangroves. (102/3. See \"Life and Letters,\" I.,\r\npage 356.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 103. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(103/1. This letter is of interest as containing a strong expression\r\nupon the overwhelming importance of selection.)\r\n\r\nDown [1860].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for Harvey's letter (103/2. W.H. Harvey had been\r\ncorresponding with Sir J.D. Hooker on the \"Origin of Species.\"), which\r\nI will keep a little longer and then return. I will write to him and\r\ntry to make clear from analogy of domestic productions the part which I\r\nbelieve selection has played. I have been reworking my pigeons and other\r\ndomestic animals, and I am sure that any one is right in saying that\r\nselection is the efficient cause, though, as you truly say, variation\r\nis the base of all. Why I do not believe so much as you do in physical\r\nagencies is that I see in almost every organism (though far more\r\nclearly in animals than in plants) adaptation, and this except in rare\r\ninstances, must, I should think, be due to selection.\r\n\r\nDo not forget the Pyrola when in flower. (103/3. In a letter to Hooker,\r\nMay 22nd, 1860, Darwin wrote: \"Have you Pyrola at Kew? if so, for\r\nheaven's sake observe the curvature of the pistil towards the gangway to\r\nthe nectary.\" The fact of the stigma in insect-visited flowers being so\r\nplaced that the visitor must touch it on its way to the nectar, was a\r\npoint which early attracted Darwin's attention and strongly impressed\r\nhim.) My blessed little Scaevola has come into flower, and I will try\r\nartificial fertilisation on it.\r\n\r\nI have looked over Harvey's letter, and have assumed (I hope rightly)\r\nthat he could not object to knowing that you had forwarded it to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 104. TO ASA GRAY. Down, June 8th [1860].\r\n\r\nI have to thank you for two notes, one through Hooker, and one with\r\nsome letters to be posted, which was done. I anticipated your request by\r\nmaking a few remarks on Owen's review. (104/1. \"The Edinburgh Review,\"\r\nApril, 1860.) Hooker is so weary of reviews that I do not think you\r\nwill get any hints from him. I have lately had many more \"kicks than\r\nhalfpence.\" A review in the last Dublin \"Nat. Hist. Review\" is the most\r\nunfair thing which has appeared,--one mass of misrepresentation. It\r\nis evidently by Haughton, the geologist, chemist and mathematician.\r\nIt shows immeasurable conceit and contempt of all who are not\r\nmathematicians. He discusses bees' cells, and puts a series which I have\r\nnever alluded to, and wholly ignores the intermediate comb of Melipona,\r\nwhich alone led me to my notions. The article is a curiosity of\r\nunfairness and arrogance; but, as he sneers at Malthus, I am content,\r\nfor it is clear he cannot reason. He is a friend of Harvey, with whom\r\nI have had some correspondence. Your article has clearly, as he admits,\r\ninfluenced him. He admits to a certain extent Natural Selection, yet I\r\nam sure does not understand me. It is strange that very few do, and I\r\nam become quite convinced that I must be an extremely bad explainer. To\r\nrecur for a moment to Owen: he grossly misrepresents and is very unfair\r\nto Huxley. You say that you think the article must be by a pupil of\r\nOwen; but no one fact tells so strongly against Owen, considering his\r\nformer position at the College of Surgeons, as that he has never reared\r\none pupil or follower. In the number just out of \"Fraser's Magazine\"\r\n(104/2. See \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 314.) there is an article or\r\nreview on Lamarck and me by W. Hopkins, the mathematician, who, like\r\nHaughton, despises the reasoning power of all naturalists. Personally he\r\nis extremely kind towards me; but he evidently in the following number\r\nmeans to blow me into atoms. He does not in the least appreciate the\r\ndifference in my views and Lamarck's, as explaining adaptation, the\r\nprinciple of divergence, the increase of dominant groups, and the almost\r\nnecessary extinction of the less dominant and smaller groups, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 105. TO C. LYELL. Down, June 17th [1860].\r\n\r\nOne word more upon the Deification (105/1. \"If we confound 'Variation'\r\nor 'Natural Selection' with such creational laws, we deify secondary\r\ncauses or immeasurably exaggerate their influence\" (Lyell, \"The\r\nGeological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man, with Remarks on Theories\r\non the Origin of Species by Variation,\" page 469, London, 1863). See\r\nLetter 131.) of Natural Selection: attributing so much weight to it\r\ndoes not exclude still more general laws, i.e. the ordering of the whole\r\nuniverse. I have said that Natural Selection is to the structure of\r\norganised beings what the human architect is to a building. The very\r\nexistence of the human architect shows the existence of more general\r\nlaws; but no one, in giving credit for a building to the human\r\narchitect, thinks it necessary to refer to the laws by which man has\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nNo astronomer, in showing how the movements of planets are due to\r\ngravity, thinks it necessary to say that the law of gravity was designed\r\nthat the planets should pursue the courses which they pursue. I cannot\r\nbelieve that there is a bit more interference by the Creator in the\r\nconstruction of each species than in the course of the planets. It\r\nis only owing to Paley and Co., I believe, that this more special\r\ninterference is thought necessary with living bodies. But we shall never\r\nagree, so do not trouble yourself to answer.\r\n\r\nI should think your remarks were very just about mathematicians not\r\nbeing better enabled to judge of probabilities than other men of\r\ncommon-sense.\r\n\r\nI have just got more returns about the gestation of hounds. The\r\nperiod differs at least from sixty-one to seventy-four days, just as I\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of sending the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" to you, on account\r\nof a paper by me on the fertilisation of orchids by insects (105/2.\r\n\"Fertilisation of British Orchids by Insect Agency.\" This article in\r\nthe \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" of June 9th, 1860, page 528, begins with a\r\nrequest that observations should be made on the manner of fertilisation\r\nin the bee-and in the fly-orchis.), as it involves a curious point, and\r\nas you cared about my paper on kidney beans; but as you are so busy, I\r\nwill not.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 106. TO C. LYELL. Down [June?] 20th [1860].\r\n\r\nI send Blyth (106/1. See Letter 27.); it is a dreadful handwriting; the\r\npassage is on page 4. In a former note he told me he feared there was\r\nhardly a chance of getting money for the Chinese expedition, and spoke\r\nof your kindness.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your long and interesting letter. I wonder at, admire,\r\nand thank you for your patience in writing so much. I rather demur to\r\nDeinosaurus not having \"free will,\" as surely we have. I demur also\r\nto your putting Huxley's \"force and matter\" in the same category with\r\nNatural Selection. The latter may, of course, be quite a false view; but\r\nsurely it is not getting beyond our depth to first causes.\r\n\r\nIt is truly very remarkable that the gestation of hounds (106/2. In\r\na letter written to Lyell on June 25th, 1860, the following paragraph\r\noccurs: \"You need not believe one word of what I said about gestation\r\nof dogs. Since writing to you I have had more correspondence with the\r\nmaster of hounds, and I see his [record?] is worth nothing. It may,\r\nof course, be correct, but cannot be trusted. I find also different\r\nstatements about the wolf: in fact, I am all abroad.\") should vary so\r\nmuch, while that of man does not. It may be from multiple origin. The\r\neggs from the Musk and the common duck take an intermediate period in\r\nhatching; but I should rather look at it as one of the ten thousand\r\ncases which we cannot explain--namely, when one part or function varies\r\nin one species and not in another.\r\n\r\nHooker has told me nothing about his explanation of few Arctic forms; I\r\nknew the fact before. I had speculated on what I presume, from what you\r\nsay, is his explanation (106/3. \"Outlines of the Distribution of Arctic\r\nPlants,\" J.D. Hooker, \"Trans. Linn. Soc.\" Volume XXIII., page 251, 1862.\r\n[read June 21st, 1860.] In this paper Hooker draws attention to the\r\nexceptional character of the Greenland flora; but as regards the paucity\r\nof its species and in its much greater resemblance to the floras of\r\nArctic Europe than to those of Arctic America, he considers it difficult\r\nto account for these facts, \"unless we admit Mr. Darwin's hypotheses\"\r\n(see \"Origin,\" Edition VI., 1872, Chapter XII., page 330) of a southern\r\nmigration due to the cold of the glacial period and the subsequent\r\nreturn of the northern types during the succeeding warmer period. Many\r\nof the Greenland species, being confined to the peninsula, \"would, as it\r\nwere, be driven into the sea--that is exterminated\" (Hooker, op. cit.,\r\npages 253-4).); but there must have been at all times an Arctic region.\r\nI found the speculation got too complex, as it seemed to me, to be worth\r\nfollowing out.\r\n\r\nI have been doing some more interesting work with orchids. Talk of\r\nadaptation in woodpeckers (106/4. \"Can a more striking instance of\r\nadaptation be given than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees and\r\nseizing insects in the chinks of the bark?\" (Origin of Species,\" Edition\r\nHAVE I., page 141).), some of the orchids beat it.\r\n\r\nI showed the case to Elizabeth Wedgwood, and her remark was, \"Now you\r\nhave upset your own book, for you won't persuade me that this could be\r\neffected by Natural Selection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 107. TO T.H. HUXLEY. July 20th [1860].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your pleasant letter. I agree to every word you say\r\nabout \"Fraser\" and the \"Quarterly.\" (107/1. Bishop Wilberforce's review\r\nof the \"Origin\" in the \"Quarterly Review,\" July, 1860, was republished\r\nin his \"Collected Essays,\" 1874. See \"Life and Letters, II., page 182,\r\nand II., page 324, where some quotations from the review are given.\r\nFor Hopkins' review in \"Fraser's Magazine,\" June, 1860, see \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" II., 314.) I have had some really admirable letters\r\nfrom Hopkins. I do not suppose he has ever troubled his head about\r\ngeographical distribution, classification, morphologies, etc., and it\r\nis only those who have that will feel any relief in having some sort of\r\nrational explanation of such facts. Is it not grand the way in which the\r\nBishop asserts that all such facts are explained by ideas in God's mind?\r\nThe \"Quarterly\" is uncommonly clever; and I chuckled much at the way\r\nmy grandfather and self are quizzed. I could here and there see Owen's\r\nhand. By the way, how comes it that you were not attacked? Does Owen\r\nbegin to find it more prudent to leave you alone? I would give five\r\nshillings to know what tremendous blunder the Bishop made; for I see\r\nthat a page has been cancelled and a new page gummed in.\r\n\r\nI am indeed most thoroughly contented with the progress of opinion.\r\nFrom all that I hear from several quarters, it seems that Oxford did\r\nthe subject great good. (107/2. An account of the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation at Oxford in 1860 is given in the \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nII., page 320, and a fuller account in the one-volume \"Life of Charles\r\nDarwin,\" 1892, page 236. See also the \"Life and Letters of T.H. Huxley,\"\r\nVolume I., page 179, and the amusing account of the meeting in Mr.\r\nTuckwell's \"Reminiscences of Oxford,\" London, 1900, page 50.) It is of\r\nenormous importance the showing the world that a few first-rate men\r\nare not afraid of expressing their opinion. I see daily more and more\r\nplainly that my unaided book would have done absolutely nothing. Asa\r\nGray is fighting admirably in the United States. He is thorough master\r\nof the subject, which cannot be said by any means of such men as even\r\nHopkins.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking over what you allude to about a natural history\r\nreview. (107/3. In the \"Life and Letters of T.H. Huxley,\" Volume I.,\r\npage 209, some account of the founding of the \"Natural History Review\"\r\nis given in a letter to Sir J.D. Hooker of July 17th, 1860. On August\r\n2nd Mr. Huxley added: \"Darwin wrote me a very kind expostulation about\r\nit, telling me I ought not to waste myself on other than original work.\r\nIn reply, however, I assured him that I MUST waste myself willy-nilly,\r\nand that the 'Review' was only a save-all.\") I suppose you mean really\r\na REVIEW and not journal for original communications in Natural History.\r\nOf the latter there is now superabundance. With respect to a good\r\nreview, there can be no doubt of its value and utility; nevertheless, if\r\nnot too late, I hope you will consider deliberately before you decide.\r\nRemember what a deal of work you have on your shoulders, and though you\r\ncan do much, yet there is a limit to even the hardest worker's power of\r\nworking. I should deeply regret to see you sacrificing much time which\r\ncould be given to original research. I fear, to one who can review as\r\nwell as you do, there would be the same temptation to waste time, as\r\nthere notoriously is for those who can speak well.\r\n\r\nA review is only temporary; your work should be perennial. I know well\r\nthat you may say that unless good men will review there will be no good\r\nreviews. And this is true. Would you not do more good by an occasional\r\nreview in some well-established review, than by giving up much time\r\nto the editing, or largely aiding, if not editing, a review which from\r\nbeing confined to one subject would not have a very large circulation?\r\nBut I must return to the chief idea which strikes me--viz., that it\r\nwould lessen the amount of original and perennial work which you could\r\ndo. Reflect how few men there are in England who can do original work\r\nin the several lines in which you are excellently fitted. Lyell, I\r\nremember, on analogous grounds many years ago resolved he would write no\r\nmore reviews. I am an old slowcoach, and your scheme makes me tremble.\r\nGod knows in one sense I am about the last man in England who ought to\r\nthrow cold water on any review in which you would be concerned, as I\r\nhave so immensely profited by your labours in this line.\r\n\r\nWith respect to reviewing myself, I never tried: any work of that kind\r\nstops me doing anything else, as I cannot possibly work at odds and\r\nends of time. I have, moreover, an insane hatred of stopping my regular\r\ncurrent of work. I have now materials for a little paper or two, but I\r\nknow I shall never work them up. So I will not promise to help; though\r\nnot to help, if I could, would make me feel very ungrateful to you. You\r\nhave no idea during how short a time daily I am able to work. If I had\r\nany regular duties, like you and Hooker, I should do absolutely nothing\r\nin science.\r\n\r\nI am heartily glad to hear that you are better; but how such labour as\r\nvolunteer-soldiering (all honour to you) does not kill you, I cannot\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nFor God's sake remember that your field of labour is original research\r\nin the highest and most difficult branches of Natural History. Not that\r\nI wish to underrate the importance of clever and solid reviews.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 108. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Sudbrook Park, Richmond, Thursday [July,\r\n1860].\r\n\r\nI must send you a line to say what a good fellow you are to send me so\r\nlong an account of the Oxford doings. I have read it twice, and sent\r\nit to my wife, and when I get home shall read it again: it has so much\r\ninterested me. But how durst you attack a live bishop in that fashion? I\r\nam quite ashamed of you! Have you no reverence for fine lawn sleeves?\r\nBy Jove, you seem to have done it well. If any one were to ridicule any\r\nbelief of the bishop's, would he not blandly shrug his shoulders and be\r\ninexpressibly shocked? I am very, very sorry to hear that you are not\r\nwell; but am not surprised after all your self-imposed labour. I hope\r\nyou will soon have an outing, and that will do you real good.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear about J. Lubbock, whom I hope to see soon, and\r\nshall tell him what you have said. Have you read Hopkins in the last\r\n\"Fraser?\"--well put, in good spirit, except soul discussion bad, as I\r\nhave told him; nothing actually new, takes the weak points alone, and\r\nleaves out all other considerations.\r\n\r\nI heard from Asa Gray yesterday; he goes on fighting like a Trojan.\r\n\r\nGod bless you!--get well, be idle, and always reverence a bishop.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 109. TO J.D. DANA. Down, July 30th [1860].\r\n\r\nI received several weeks ago your note telling me that you could not\r\nvisit England, which I sincerely regretted, as I should most heartily\r\nhave liked to have made your personal acquaintance. You gave me an\r\nimproved, but not very good, account of your health. I should at some\r\ntime be grateful for a line to tell me how you are. We have had a\r\nmiserable summer, owing to a terribly long and severe illness of\r\nmy eldest girl, who improves slightly but is still in a precarious\r\ncondition. I have been able to do nothing in science of late. My kind\r\nfriend Asa Gray often writes to me and tells me of the warm discussions\r\non the \"Origin of Species\" in the United States. Whenever you are\r\nstrong enough to read it, I know you will be dead against me, but I know\r\nequally well that your opposition will be liberal and philosophical.\r\nAnd this is a good deal more than I can say of all my opponents in\r\nthis country. I have not yet seen Agassiz's attack (109/1. \"Silliman's\r\nJournal,\" July, 1860. A passage from Agassiz's review is given by Mr.\r\nHuxley in Darwin's \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 184.), but I hope to\r\nfind it at home when I return in a few days, for I have been for several\r\nweeks away from home on my daughter's account. Prof. Silliman sent me an\r\nextremely kind message by Asa Gray that your Journal would be open to\r\na reply by me. I cannot decide till I see it, but on principle I have\r\nresolved to avoid answering anything, as it consumes much time,\r\noften temper, and I have said my say in the \"Origin.\" No one person\r\nunderstands my views and has defended them so well as A. Gray, though he\r\ndoes not by any means go all the way with me. There was much discussion\r\non the subject at the British Association at Oxford, and I had many\r\ndefenders, and my side seems (for I was not there) almost to have got\r\nthe best of the battle. Your correspondent and my neighbour, J. Lubbock,\r\ngoes on working at such spare time as he has. This is an egotistical\r\nnote, but I have not seen a naturalist for months. Most sincerely and\r\ndeeply do I hope that this note may find you almost recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 110. TO W.H. HARVEY.\r\n\r\n(110/1. See Letter 95, note. This letter was written in reply to a\r\nlong one from W.H. Harvey, dated August 24th, 1860. Harvey had already\r\npublished a serio-comic squib and a review, to which references are\r\ngiven in the \"Life and Letters,\" II., pages 314 and 375; but apparently\r\nhe had not before this time completed the reading of the \"Origin.\")\r\n\r\n[August, 1860.]\r\n\r\nI have read your long letter with much interest, and I thank you for\r\nyour great liberality in sending it me. But, on reflection, I do not\r\nwish to attempt answering any part, except to you privately. Anything\r\nsaid by myself in defence would have no weight; it is best to be\r\ndefended by others, or not at all. Parts of your letter seem to me, if\r\nI may be permitted to say so, very acute and original, and I feel it\r\na great compliment your giving up so much time to my book. But, on the\r\nwhole, I am disappointed; not from your not concurring with me, for I\r\nnever expected that, and, indeed, in your remarks on Chapters XII. and\r\nXIII., you go much further with me (though a little way) than I ever\r\nanticipated, and am much pleased at the result. But on the whole I am\r\ndisappointed, because it seems to me that you do not understand what I\r\nmean by Natural Selection, as shown at page 11 (110/2. Harvey speaks of\r\nthe perpetuation or selection of the useful, pre-supposing \"a vigilant\r\nand intelligent agent,\" which is very much like saying that an\r\nintelligent agent is needed to see that the small stones pass through\r\nthe meshes of a sieve and the big ones remain behind.) of your letter\r\nand by several of your remarks. As my book has failed to explain my\r\nmeaning, it would be hopeless to attempt it in a letter. You speak in\r\nthe early part of your letter, and at page 9, as if I had said that\r\nNatural Selection was the sole agency of modification, whereas I\r\nhave over and over again, ad nauseam, directly said, and by order of\r\nprecedence implied (what seems to me obvious) that selection can do\r\nnothing without previous variability (see pages 80, 108, 127, 468, 469,\r\netc.), \"nothing can be effected unless favourable variations occur.\"\r\nI consider Natural Selection as of such high importance, because it\r\naccumulates successive variations in any profitable direction, and\r\nthus adapts each new being to its complex conditions of life. The term\r\n\"selection,\" I see, deceives many persons, though I see no more reason\r\nwhy it should than elective affinity, as used by the old chemists. If I\r\nhad to rewrite my book, I would use \"natural preservation\" or \"naturally\r\npreserved.\" I should think you would as soon take an emetic as re-read\r\nany part of my book; but if you did, and were to erase selection and\r\nselected, and insert preservation and preserved, possibly the subject\r\nwould be clearer. As you are not singular in misunderstanding my book, I\r\nshould long before this have concluded that my brains were in a haze had\r\nI not found by published reviews, and especially by correspondence, that\r\nLyell, Hooker, Asa Gray, H.C. Watson, Huxley, and Carpenter, and many\r\nothers, perfectly comprehend what I mean. The upshot of your remarks at\r\npage 11 is that my explanation, etc., and the whole doctrine of Natural\r\nSelection, are mere empty words, signifying the \"order of nature.\" As\r\nthe above-named clear-headed men, who do comprehend my views, all go a\r\ncertain length with me, and certainly do not think it all moonshine, I\r\nshould venture to suggest a little further reflection on your part. I do\r\nnot mean by this to imply that the opinion of these men is worth much as\r\nshowing that I am right, but merely as some evidence that I have\r\nclearer ideas than you think, otherwise these same men must be even\r\nmore muddle-headed than I am; for they have no temptation to deceive\r\nthemselves. In the forthcoming September (110/3. \"American Journal of\r\nScience and Arts,\" September 1860, \"Design versus Necessity,\" reprinted\r\nin Asa Gray's \"Darwiniana,\" 1876, page 62.) number of the \"American\r\nJournal of Science\" there is an interesting and short theological\r\narticle (by Asa Gray), which gives incidentally with admirable clearness\r\nthe theory of Natural Selection, and therefore might be worth your\r\nreading. I think that the theological part would interest you.\r\n\r\nYou object to all my illustrations. They are all necessarily\r\nconjectural, and may be all false; but they were the best I could give.\r\nThe bear case (110/4. \"Origin of Species,\" Edition I., page 184. See\r\nLetter 120.) has been well laughed at, and disingenuously distorted by\r\nsome into my saying that a bear could be converted into a whale. As it\r\noffended persons, I struck it out in the second edition; but I still\r\nmaintain that there is no especial difficulty in a bear's mouth\r\nbeing enlarged to any degree useful to its changing habits,--no more\r\ndifficulty than man has found in increasing the crop of the pigeon, by\r\ncontinued selection, until it is literally as big as the whole rest of\r\nthe body. If this had not been known, how absurd it would have appeared\r\nto say that the crop of a bird might be increased till it became like a\r\nballoon!\r\n\r\nWith respect to the ostrich, I believe that the wings have been reduced,\r\nand are not in course of development, because the whole structure of a\r\nbird is essentially formed for flight; and the ostrich is essentially\r\na bird. You will see at page 182 of the \"Origin\" a somewhat analogous\r\ndiscussion. At page 450 of the second edition I have pointed out the\r\nessential distinction between a nascent and rudimentary organ. If you\r\nprefer the more complex view that the progenitor of the ostrich lost its\r\nwings, and that the present ostrich is regaining them, I have nothing to\r\nsay in opposition.\r\n\r\nWith respect to trees on islands, I collected some cases, but took the\r\nmain facts from Alph. De Candolle, and thought they might be trusted. My\r\nexplanation may be grossly wrong; but I am not convinced it is so, and I\r\ndo not see the full force of your argument of certain herbaceous orders\r\nhaving been developed into trees in certain rare cases on continents.\r\nThe case seems to me to turn altogether on the question whether\r\ngenerally herbaceous orders more frequently afford trees and bushes on\r\nislands than on continents, relatively to their areas. (110/5. In\r\nthe \"Origin,\" Edition I., page 392, the author points out that in the\r\npresence of competing trees an herbaceous plant would have little chance\r\nof becoming arborescent; but on an island, with only other herbaceous\r\nplants as competitors, it might gain an advantage by overtopping its\r\nfellows, and become tree-like. Harvey writes: \"What you say (page\r\n392) of insular trees belonging to orders which elsewhere include only\r\nherbaceous species seems to me to be unsupported by sufficient evidence.\r\nYou cite no particular trees, and I may therefore be wrong in guessing\r\nthat the orders you allude to are Scrophularineae and Compositae; and\r\nthe insular trees the Antarctic Veronicas and the arborescent\r\nCompositae of St. Helena, Tasmania, etc. But in South Africa Halleria\r\n(Scrophularineae) is often as large and woody as an apple tree; and\r\nthere are several South African arborescent Compositae (Senecio and\r\nOldenburgia). Besides, in Tasmania at least, the arborescent Composites\r\nare not found competing with herbaceous plants alone, and growing taller\r\nand taller by overtopping them...; for the most arborescent of them all\r\n(Eurybia argophylla, the Musk tree) grows...in Eucalyptus forests. And\r\nso of the South African Halleria, which is a tree among trees. What the\r\nconditions of the arborescent Gerania of the Sandwich Islands may be\r\nI am unable to say...I cannot remember any other instances, nor can I\r\naccept your explanation in any other of the cases I have cited.\")\r\n\r\nIn page 4 of your letter you say you give up many book-species as\r\nseparate creations: I give up all, and you infer that our difference\r\nis only in degree and not in kind. I dissent from this; for I give a\r\ndistinct reason how far I go in giving up species. I look at all forms,\r\nwhich resemble each other homologically or embryologically, as certainly\r\ndescended from the same species.\r\n\r\nYou hit me hard and fairly (110/6. Harvey writes: \"You ask--were all the\r\ninfinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed,\r\nor as full grown? To this it is sufficient to reply, was your primordial\r\norganism, or were your four or five progenitors created as egg, seed,\r\nor full grown? Neither theory attempts to solve this riddle, nor yet the\r\nriddle of the Omphalos.\" The latter point, which Mr. Darwin refuses to\r\ngive up, is at page 483 of the \"Origin,\" \"and, in the case of mammals,\r\nwere they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the\r\nmother's womb?\" In the third edition of the \"Origin,\" 1861, page 517,\r\nthe author adds, after the last-cited passage: \"Undoubtedly these same\r\nquestions cannot be answered by those who, under the present state of\r\nscience, believe in the creation of a few aboriginal forms, or of some\r\none form of life. In the sixth edition, probably with a view to the\r\numbilicus, he writes (page 423): \"Undoubtedly some of these same\r\nquestions,\" etc., etc. From notes in Mr. Darwin's copy of the second\r\nedition it is clear that the change in the third edition was chiefly\r\ndue to Harvey's letter. See Letter 115.) about my question (page 483,\r\n\"Origin\") about creation of eggs or young, etc., (but not about mammals\r\nwith the mark of the umbilical cord), yet I still have an illogical sort\r\nof feeling that there is less difficulty in imagining the creation of an\r\nasexual cell, increasing by simple division.\r\n\r\nPage 5 of your letter: I agree to every word about the antiquity of the\r\nworld, and never saw the case put by any one more strongly or more ably.\r\nIt makes, however, no more impression on me as an objection than does\r\nthe astronomer when he puts on a few hundred million miles to the\r\ndistance of the fixed stars. To compare very small things with great,\r\nLingula, etc., remaining nearly unaltered from the Silurian epoch to\r\nthe present day, is like the dovecote pigeons still being identical with\r\nwild Rock-pigeons, whereas its \"fancy\" offspring have been immensely\r\nmodified, and are still being modified, by means of artificial\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nYou put the difficulty of the first modification of the first protozoon\r\nadmirably. I assure you that immediately after the first edition was\r\npublished this occurred to me, and I thought of inserting it in the\r\nsecond edition. I did not, because we know not in the least what the\r\nfirst germ of life was, nor have we any fact at all to guide us in our\r\nspeculations on the kind of change which its offspring underwent. I\r\ndissent quite from what you say of the myriads of years it would take to\r\npeople the world with such imagined protozoon. In how very short a time\r\nEhrenberg calculated that a single infusorium might make a cube of rock!\r\nA single cube on geometrical progression would make the solid globe\r\nin (I suppose) under a century. From what little I know, I cannot help\r\nthinking that you underrate the effects of the physical conditions of\r\nlife on these low organisms. But I fully admit that I can give no sort\r\nof answer to your objections; yet I must add that it would be marvellous\r\nif any man ever could, assuming for the moment that my theory is true.\r\nYou beg the question, I think, in saying that Protococcus would be\r\ndoomed to eternal similarity. Nor can you know that the first germ\r\nresembled a Protococcus or any other now living form.\r\n\r\nPage 12 of your letter: There is nothing in my theory necessitating in\r\neach case progression of organisation, though Natural Selection tends in\r\nthis line, and has generally thus acted. An animal, if it become\r\nfitted by selection to live the life, for instance, of a parasite, will\r\ngenerally become degraded. I have much regretted that I did not make\r\nthis part of the subject clearer. I left out this and many other\r\nsubjects, which I now see ought to have been introduced. I have inserted\r\na discussion on this subject in the foreign editions. (110/7. In the\r\nthird Edition a discussion on this point is added in Chapter IV.) In\r\nno case will any organic being tend to retrograde, unless such\r\nretrogradation be an advantage to its varying offspring; and it is\r\ndifficult to see how going back to the structure of the unknown supposed\r\noriginal protozoon could ever be an advantage.\r\n\r\nPage 13 of your letter: I have been more glad to read your discussion\r\non \"dominant\" forms than any part of your letter. (110/8. Harvey\r\nwrites: \"Viewing organic nature in its widest aspect, I think it is\r\nunquestionable that the truly dominant races are not those of high, but\r\nthose of low organisation\"; and goes on to quote the potato disease,\r\netc. In the third edition of the \"Origin,\" page 56, a discussion is\r\nintroduced defining the author's use of the term \"dominant.\") I can now\r\nsee that I have not been cautious enough in confining my definition\r\nand meaning. I cannot say that you have altered my views. If Botrytis\r\n[Phytophthora] had exterminated the wild potato, a low form would have\r\nconquered a high; but I cannot remember that I have ever said (I am\r\nsure I never thought) that a low form would never conquer a high. I have\r\nexpressly alluded to parasites half exterminating game-animals, and\r\nto the struggle for life being sometimes between forms as different as\r\npossible: for instance, between grasshoppers and herbivorous quadrupeds.\r\nUnder the many conditions of life which this world affords, any group\r\nwhich is numerous in individuals and species and is widely distributed,\r\nmay properly be called dominant. I never dreamed of considering that\r\nany one group, under all conditions and throughout the world, would be\r\npredominant. How could vertebrata be predominant under the conditions\r\nof life in which parasitic worms live? What good would their perfected\r\nsenses and their intellect serve under such conditions? When I have\r\nspoken of dominant forms, it has been in relation to the multiplication\r\nof new specific forms, and the dominance of any one species has been\r\nrelative generally to other members of the same group, or at least to\r\nbeings exposed to similar conditions and coming into competition. But I\r\ndaresay that I have not in the \"Origin\" made myself clear, and space has\r\nrendered it impossible. But I thank you most sincerely for your valuable\r\nremarks, though I do not agree with them.\r\n\r\nAbout sudden jumps: I have no objection to them--they would aid me in\r\nsome cases. All I can say is, that I went into the subject, and found\r\nno evidence to make me believe in jumps; and a good deal pointing in the\r\nother direction. You will find it difficult (page 14 of your letter) to\r\nmake a marked line of separation between fertile and infertile crosses.\r\nI do not see how the apparently sudden change (for the suddenness of\r\nchange in a chrysalis is of course largely only apparent) in larvae\r\nduring their development throws any light on the subject.\r\n\r\nI wish I could have made this letter better worth sending to you. I have\r\nhad it copied to save you at least the intolerable trouble of reading\r\nmy bad handwriting. Again I thank you for your great liberality and\r\nkindness in sending me your criticisms, and I heartily wish we were\r\na little nearer in accord; but we must remain content to be as wide\r\nasunder as the poles, but without, thank God, any malice or other\r\nill-feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 111. TO T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n(111/1. Dr. Asa Gray's articles in the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" July, August,\r\nand October, 1860, were published in England as a pamphlet, and form\r\nChapter III. in his \"Darwiniana\" (1876). See \"Life and Letters,\" II.,\r\npage 338. The article referred to in the present letter is that in the\r\nAugust number.)\r\n\r\nDown, September 10th [1860].\r\n\r\nI send by this post a review by Asa Gray, so good that I should like you\r\nto see it; I must beg for its return. I want to ask, also, your opinion\r\nabout getting it reprinted in England. I thought of sending it to the\r\nEditor of the \"Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.\" in which two hostile\r\nreviews have appeared (although I suppose the \"Annals\" have a very poor\r\ncirculation), and asking them in the spirit of fair play to print this,\r\nwith Asa Gray's name, which I will take the responsibility of adding.\r\nAlso, as it is long, I would offer to pay expenses.\r\n\r\nIt is very good, in addition, as bringing in Pictet so largely.\r\n(111/2. Pictet (1809-72) wrote a \"perfectly fair\" review opposed to the\r\n\"Origin.\" See \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 297.) Tell me briefly what\r\nyou think.\r\n\r\nWhat an astonishing expedition this is of Hooker's to Syria! God knows\r\nwhether it is wise.\r\n\r\nHow are you and all yours? I hope you are not working too hard. For\r\nHeaven's sake, think that you may become such a beast as I am. How goes\r\non the \"Nat. Hist. Review?\" Talking of reviews, I damned with a good\r\ngrace the review in the \"Athenaeum\" (111/3. Review of \"The Glaciers of\r\nthe Alps\" (\"Athenaeum,\" September 1, 1860, page 280).) on Tyndall with a\r\nmean, scurvy allusion to you. It is disgraceful about Tyndall,--in fact,\r\ndoubting his veracity.\r\n\r\nI am very tired, and hate nearly the whole world. So good-night, and\r\ntake care of your digestion, which means brain.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 112. TO C. LYELL. 15, Marine Parade, Eastbourne, 26th [September\r\n1860].\r\n\r\nIt has just occurred to me that I took no notice of your questions on\r\nextinction in St. Helena. I am nearly sure that Hooker has information\r\non the extinction of plants (112/1. \"Principles of Geology,\" Volume II.\r\n(Edition X., 1868), page 453. Facts are quoted from Hooker illustrating\r\nthe extermination of plants in St. Helena.), but I cannot remember\r\nwhere I have seen it. One may confidently assume that many insects were\r\nexterminated.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I heard lately from Wollaston, who told me that he had just\r\nreceived eminently Madeira and Canary Island insect forms from the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, to which trifling distance, if he is logical, he will have\r\nto extend his Atlantis! I have just received your letter, and am very\r\nmuch pleased that you approve. But I am utterly disgusted and ashamed\r\nabout the dingo. I cannot think how I could have misunderstood the paper\r\nso grossly. I hope I have not blundered likewise in its co-existence\r\nwith extinct species: what horrid blundering! I am grieved to hear that\r\nyou think I must work in the notes in the text; but you are so much\r\nbetter a judge that I will obey. I am sorry that you had the trouble of\r\nreturning the Dog MS., which I suppose I shall receive to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI mean to give good woodcuts of all the chief races of pigeons. (112/2.\r\n\"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,\" 1868.)\r\n\r\nExcept the C. oenas (112/3. The Columba oenas of Europe roosts on trees\r\nand builds its nest in holes, either in trees or the ground (\"Var.\r\nof Animals,\" Volume I., page 183).) (which is partly, indeed almost\r\nentirely, a wood pigeon), there is no other rock pigeon with which\r\nour domestic pigeon would cross--that is, if several exceedingly close\r\ngeographical races of C. livia, which hardly any ornithologist looks at\r\nas true species, be all grouped under C. livia. (112/4. Columba livia,\r\nthe Rock-pigeon. \"We may conclude with confidence that all the domestic\r\nraces, notwithstanding their great amount of difference, are descended\r\nfrom the Columba livia, including under this name certain wild races\"\r\n(op. cit., Volume I., page 223).)\r\n\r\nI am writing higgledy-piggledy, as I re-read your letter. I thought that\r\nmy letter had been much wilder than yours. I quite feel the comfort of\r\nwriting when one may \"alter one's speculations the day after.\" It is\r\nbeyond my knowledge to weigh ranks of birds and monotremes; in the\r\nrespiratory and circulatory system and muscular energy I believe birds\r\nare ahead of all mammals.\r\n\r\nI knew that you must have known about New Guinea; but in writing to you\r\nI never make myself civil!\r\n\r\nAfter treating some half-dozen or dozen domestic animals in the same\r\nmanner as I treat dogs, I intended to have a chapter of conclusions.\r\nBut Heaven knows when I shall finish: I get on very slowly. You would be\r\nsurprised how long it took me to pick out what seemed useful about dogs\r\nout of multitudes of details.\r\n\r\nI see the force of your remark about more isolated races of man in old\r\ntimes, and therefore more in number. It seems to me difficult to weigh\r\nprobabilities. Perhaps so, if you refer to very slight differences in\r\nthe races: to make great differences much time would be required, and\r\nthen, even at the earliest period I should have expected one race to\r\nhave spread, conquered, and exterminated the others.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Falconer's series of Elephants (112/5. In 1837 Dr.\r\nFalconer and Sir Proby Cautley collected a large number of fossil\r\nremains from the Siwalik Hills. Falconer and Cautley, \"Fauna Antiqua\r\nSivalensis,\" 1845-49.), I think the case could be answered better than\r\nI have done in the \"Origin,\" page 334. (112/6. \"Origin of Species,\"\r\nEdition I., page 334. \"It is no real objection to the truth of\r\nthe statement that the fauna of each period as a whole is nearly\r\nintermediate in character between the preceding and succeeding faunas,\r\nthat certain genera offer exceptions to the rule. For instance,\r\nmastodons and elephants, when arranged by Dr. Falconer in two series,\r\nfirst according to their mutual affinities and then according to their\r\nperiods of existence, do not accord in arrangement. The species extreme\r\nin character are not the oldest, or the most recent; nor are those which\r\nare intermediate in character intermediate in age. But supposing for\r\nan instant, in this and other such cases, that the record of the first\r\nappearance and disappearance of the species was perfect, we have no\r\nreason to believe that forms successively produced necessarily\r\nendure for corresponding lengths of time. A very ancient form might\r\noccasionally last much longer than a form elsewhere subsequently\r\nproduced, especially in the case of terrestrial productions inhabiting\r\nseparated districts\" (pages 334-5). The same words occur in the\r\nlater edition of the \"Origin\" (Edition VI., page 306.) All these new\r\ndiscoveries show how imperfect the discovered series is, which Falconer\r\nthought years ago was nearly perfect.\r\n\r\nI will send to-day or to-morrow two articles by Asa Gray. The longer\r\none (now not finally corrected) will come out in the October \"Atlantic\r\nMonthly,\" and they can be got at Trubner's. Hearty thanks for all your\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nDo not hurry over Asa Gray. He strikes me as one of the best reasoners\r\nand writers I ever read. He knows my book as well as I do myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 113. TO C. LYELL. 15, Marine Parade, Eastbourne, October 3rd\r\n[1860].\r\n\r\nYour last letter has interested me much in many ways.\r\n\r\nI enclose a letter of Wyman's which touches on brains. Wyman is mistaken\r\nin supposing that I did not know that the Cave-rat was an American form;\r\nI made special enquiries. He does not know that the eye of the Tucotuco\r\nwas carefully dissected.\r\n\r\nWith respect to reviews by A. Gray. I thought of sending the Dialogue\r\nto the \"Saturday Review\" in a week's time or so, as they have lately\r\ndiscussed Design. (113/1. \"Discussion between two Readers of Darwin's\r\nTreatise on the Origin of Species, upon its Natural Theology\" (\"Amer.\r\nJourn. Sci.\" Volume XXX, page 226, 1860). Reprinted in \"Darwiniana,\"\r\n1876, page 62. The article begins with the following question: \"First\r\nReader--Is Darwin's theory atheistic or pantheistic? Or does it tend to\r\natheism or pantheism?\" The discussion is closed by the Second Reader,\r\nwho thus sums up his views: \"Wherefore we may insist that, for all\r\nthat yet appears, the argument for design, as presented by the natural\r\ntheologians, is just as good now, if we accept Darwin's theory, as it\r\nwas before the theory was promulgated; and that the sceptical juryman,\r\nwho was about to join the other eleven in an unanimous verdict in favour\r\nof design, finds no good excuse for keeping the Court longer waiting.\")\r\nI have sent the second, or August, \"Atlantic\" article to the \"Annals and\r\nMag. of Nat. History.\" (113/2. \"Annals and Mag. Nat. Hist.\" Volume VI.,\r\npages 373-86, 1860. (From the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" August, 1860.)) The\r\ncopy which you have I want to send to Pictet, as I told A. Gray I\r\nwould, thinking from what he said he would like this to be done. I doubt\r\nwhether it would be possible to get the October number reprinted in this\r\ncountry; so that I am in no hurry at all for this.\r\n\r\nI had a letter a few weeks ago from Symonds on the imperfection of the\r\nGeological Record, less clear and forcible than I expected. I answered\r\nhim at length and very civilly, though I could hardly make out what\r\nhe was driving at. He spoke about you in a way which it did me good to\r\nread.\r\n\r\nI am extremely glad that you like A. Gray's reviews. How generous and\r\nunselfish he has been in all his labour! Are you not struck by his\r\nmetaphors and similes? I have told him he is a poet and not a lawyer.\r\n\r\nI should altogether doubt on turtles being converted into land tortoises\r\non any one island. Remember how closely similar tortoises are on all\r\ncontinents, as well as islands; they must have all descended from one\r\nancient progenitor, including the gigantic tortoise of the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nI think you must be cautious in not running the convenient doctrine that\r\nonly one species out of very many ever varies. Reflect on such cases as\r\nthe fauna and flora of Europe, North America, and Japan, which are so\r\nsimilar, and yet which have a great majority of their species either\r\nspecifically distinct, or forming well-marked races. We must in such\r\ncases incline to the belief that a multitude of species were once\r\nidentically the same in all the three countries when under a warmer\r\nclimate and more in connection; and have varied in all the three\r\ncountries. I am inclined to believe that almost every species (as we\r\nsee with nearly all our domestic productions) varies sufficiently for\r\nNatural Selection to pick out and accumulate new specific differences,\r\nunder new organic and inorganic conditions of life, whenever a place is\r\nopen in the polity of nature. But looking to a long lapse of time and to\r\nthe whole world, or to large parts of the world, I believe only one or\r\na few species of each large genus ultimately becomes victorious, and\r\nleaves modified descendants. To give an imaginary instance: the jay has\r\nbecome modified in the three countries into (I believe) three or four\r\nspecies; but the jay genus is not, apparently, so dominant a group\r\nas the crows; and in the long run probably all the jays will be\r\nexterminated and be replaced perhaps by some modified crows.\r\n\r\nI merely give this illustration to show what seems to me probable.\r\n\r\nBut oh! what work there is before we shall understand the genealogy of\r\norganic beings!\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Apteryx, I know not enough of anatomy; but ask Dr.\r\nF. whether the clavicle, etc., do not give attachment to some of the\r\nmuscles of respiration. If my views are at all correct, the wing of the\r\nApteryx (113/3. \"Origin of Species,\" Edition VI., page 140.) cannot be\r\n(page 452 of the \"Origin\") a nascent organ, as these wings are useless.\r\nI dare not trust to memory, but I know I found the whole sternum always\r\nreduced in size in all the fancy and confined pigeons relatively to the\r\nsame bones in the wild Rock-pigeon: the keel was generally still further\r\nreduced relatively to the reduced length of the sternum; but in some\r\nbreeds it was in a most anomalous manner more prominent. I have got a\r\nlot of facts on the reduction of the organs of flight in the pigeon,\r\nwhich took me weeks to work out, and which Huxley thought curious.\r\n\r\nI am utterly ashamed, and groan over my handwriting. It was \"Natural\r\nPreservation.\" Natural persecution is what the author ought to suffer.\r\nIt rejoices me that you do not object to the term. Hooker made the same\r\nremark that it ought to have been \"Variation and Natural Selection.\"\r\nYet with domestic productions, when selection is spoken of, variation is\r\nalways implied. But I entirely agree with your and Hooker's remark.\r\n\r\nHave you begun regularly to write your book on the antiquity of man?\r\n(113/4. Published in 1863.)\r\n\r\nI do NOT agree with your remark that I make Natural Selection do too\r\nmuch work. You will perhaps reply that every man rides his hobby-horse\r\nto death; and that I am in the galloping state.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 114. TO C. LYELL. 15, Marine Parade, Eastbourne, Friday 5th\r\n[October, 1860].\r\n\r\nI have two notes to thank you for, and I return Wollaston. It has always\r\nseemed to me rather strange that Forbes, Wollaston and Co. should argue,\r\nfrom the presence of allied, and not identical species in islands, for\r\nthe former continuity of land.\r\n\r\nThey argue, I suppose, from the species being allied in different\r\nregions of the same continent, though specifically distinct. But I think\r\none might on the creative doctrine argue with equal force in a directly\r\nreverse manner, and say that, as species are so often markedly distinct,\r\nyet allied, on islands, all our continents existed as islands first, and\r\ntheir inhabitants were first created on these islands, and since became\r\nmingled together, so as not to be so distinct as they now generally are\r\non islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 115. TO H.G. BRONN. Down, October 5th [1860].\r\n\r\nI ought to apologise for troubling you, but I have at last carefully\r\nread your excellent criticisms on my book. (115/1. Bronn added critical\r\nremarks to his German translation of the \"Origin\": see \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" II., page 279.) I agree with much of them, and wholly with\r\nyour final sentence. The objections and difficulties which may be urged\r\nagainst my view are indeed heavy enough almost to break my back, but it\r\nis not yet broken! You put very well and very fairly that I can in\r\nno one instance explain the course of modification in any particular\r\ninstance. I could make some sort of answer to your case of the two rats;\r\nand might I not turn round and ask him who believes in the separate\r\ncreation of each species, why one rat has a longer tail or shorter ears\r\nthan another? I presume that most people would say that these characters\r\nwere of some use, or stood in some connection with other parts; and if\r\nso, Natural Selection would act on them. But as you put the case,\r\nit tells well against me. You argue most justly against my question,\r\nwhether the many species were created as eggs (115/2. See Letter 110.)\r\nor as mature, etc. I certainly had no right to ask that question.\r\nI fully agree that there might have been as well a hundred thousand\r\ncreations as eight or ten, or only one. But then, on the view of eight\r\nor ten creations (i.e. as many as there are distinct types of structure)\r\nwe can on my view understand the homological and embryological\r\nresemblance of all the organisms of each type, and on this ground almost\r\nalone I disbelieve in the innumerable acts of creation. There are only\r\ntwo points on which I think you have misunderstood me. I refer only to\r\none Glacial period as affecting the distribution of organic beings; I\r\ndid not wish even to allude to the doubtful evidence of glacial action\r\nin the Permian and Carboniferous periods. Secondly, I do not believe\r\nthat the process of development has always been carried on at the same\r\nrate in all different parts of the world. Australia is opposed to such\r\nbelief. The nearly contemporaneous equal development in past periods I\r\nattribute to the slow migration of the higher and more dominant forms\r\nover the whole world, and not to independent acts of development in\r\ndifferent parts. Lastly, permit me to add that I cannot see the force\r\nof your objection, that nothing is effected until the origin of life is\r\nexplained: surely it is worth while to attempt to follow out the action\r\nof electricity, though we know not what electricity is.\r\n\r\nIf you should at any time do me the favour of writing to me, I should\r\nbe very much obliged if you would inform me whether you have yourself\r\nexamined Brehm's subspecies of birds; for I have looked through some of\r\nhis writings, but have never met an ornithologist who believed in his\r\n[illegible]. Are these subspecies really characteristic of certain\r\ndifferent regions of Germany?\r\n\r\nShould you write, I should much like to know how the German edition\r\nsells.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 116. TO J.S. HENSLOW. October 26th [1860].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your note and for all the trouble about the seeds, which\r\nwill be most useful to me next spring. On my return home I will send the\r\nshillings. (116/1. Shillings for the little girls in Henslow's parish\r\nwho collected seeds for Darwin.) I concluded that Dr. Bree had blundered\r\nabout the Celts. I care not for his dull, unvarying abuse of me,\r\nand singular misrepresentation. But at page 244 he in fact doubts my\r\ndeliberate word, and that is the act of a man who has not the soul of a\r\ngentleman in him. Kingsley is \"the celebrated author and divine\"\r\n(116/2. \"Species not Transmutable,\" by C.R. Bree. After quoting from the\r\n\"Origin,\" Edition II., page 481, the words in which a celebrated author\r\nand divine confesses that \"he has gradually learnt to see that it is\r\njust as noble a conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few\r\noriginal forms, etc.,\" Dr. Bree goes on: \"I think we ought to have had\r\nthe name of this divine given with this remarkable statement. I confess\r\nthat I have not yet fully made up my mind that any divine could have\r\never penned lines so fatal to the truths he is called upon to\r\nteach.\") whose striking sentence I give in the second edition with his\r\npermission. I did not choose to ask him to let me use his name, and as\r\nhe did not volunteer, I had of course no choice. (116/3. We are indebted\r\nto Mr. G.W. Prothero for calling our attention to the following striking\r\npassage from the works of a divine of this period:--\"Just a similar\r\nscepticism has been evinced by nearly all the first physiologists of the\r\nday, who have joined in rejecting the development theories of Lamarck\r\nand the 'Vestiges'...Yet it is now acknowledged under the high sanction\r\nof the name of Owen that 'creation' is only another name for our\r\nignorance of the mode of production...while a work has now appeared by\r\na naturalist of the most acknowledged authority, Mr. Darwin's masterly\r\nvolume on the 'Origin of Species,' by the law of 'natural selection,'\r\nwhich now substantiates on undeniable grounds the very principle so long\r\ndenounced by the first naturalists--the origination of new species by\r\nnatural causes: a work which must soon bring about an entire revolution\r\nof opinion in favour of the grand principle of the self-evolving\r\npowers of nature.\"--Prof. Baden Powell's \"Study of the Evidences of\r\nChristianity,\" \"Essays and Reviews,\" 7th edition, 1861 (pages 138,\r\n139).)\r\n\r\nDr. Freke has sent me his paper, which is far beyond my scope--something\r\nlike the capital quiz in the \"Anti-Jacobin\" on my grandfather, which was\r\nquoted in the \"Quarterly Review.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 117. TO D.T. ANSTED.\r\n\r\n(117/1. The following letter was published in Professor Meldola's\r\npresidential address to the Entomological Society, 1897, and to him we\r\nare indebted for a copy.)\r\n\r\n15, Marine Parade, Eastbourne, October 27th [1860].\r\n\r\nAs I am away from home on account of my daughter's health, I do not\r\nknow your address, and fly this at random, and it is of very little\r\nconsequence if it never reaches you.\r\n\r\nI have just been reading the greater part of your \"Geological Gossip,\"\r\nand have found part very interesting; but I want to express my\r\nadmiration at the clear and correct manner in which you have given a\r\nsketch of Natural Selection. You will think this very slight praise;\r\nbut I declare that the majority of readers seem utterly incapable\r\nof comprehending my long argument. Some of the reviewers, who have\r\nservilely stuck to my illustrations and almost to my words, have been\r\ncorrect, but extraordinarily few others have succeeded. I can see\r\nplainly, by your new illustrations and manner and order of putting the\r\ncase, that you thoroughly comprehend the subject. I assure you this is\r\nmost gratifying to me, and it is the sole way in which the public can\r\nbe indoctrinated. I am often in despair in making the generality of\r\nNATURALISTS even comprehend me. Intelligent men who are not naturalists\r\nand have not a bigoted idea of the term species, show more clearness\r\nof mind. I think that you have done the subject a real service, and I\r\nsincerely thank you. No doubt there will be much error found in my book,\r\nbut I have great confidence that the main view will be, in time, found\r\ncorrect; for I find, without exception, that those naturalists who went\r\nat first one inch with me now go a foot or yard with me.\r\n\r\nThis note obviously requires no answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 118. TO H.W. BATES. Down, November 22nd [1860].\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for writing to me and for your very interesting\r\nletter. Your name has for very long been familiar to me, and I have\r\nheard of your zealous exertions in the cause of Natural History. But\r\nI did not know that you had worked with high philosophical questions\r\nbefore your mind. I have an old belief that a good observer really means\r\na good theorist (118/1. For an opposite opinion, see Letter 13.), and I\r\nfully expect to find your observations most valuable. I am very sorry to\r\nhear that your health is shattered; but I trust under a healthy climate\r\nit may be restored. I can sympathise with you fully on this score, for\r\nI have had bad health for many years, and fear I shall ever remain a\r\nconfirmed invalid. I am delighted to hear that you, with all your large\r\npractical knowledge of Natural History, anticipated me in many respects\r\nand concur with me. As you say, I have been thoroughly well attacked and\r\nreviled (especially by entomologists--Westwood, Wollaston, and A. Murray\r\nhave all reviewed and sneered at me to their hearts' content), but I\r\ncare nothing about their attacks; several really good judges go a long\r\nway with me, and I observe that all those who go some little way tend\r\nto go somewhat further. What a fine philosophical mind your friend Mr.\r\nWallace has, and he has acted, in relation to me, like a true man with\r\na noble spirit. I see by your letter that you have grappled with\r\nseveral of the most difficult problems, as it seems to me, in Natural\r\nHistory--such as the distinctions between the different kinds of\r\nvarieties, representative species, etc. Perhaps I shall find some facts\r\nin your paper on intermediate varieties in intermediate regions, on\r\nwhich subject I have found remarkably little information. I cannot tell\r\nyou how glad I am to hear that you have attended to the curious point\r\nof equatorial refrigeration. I quite agree that it must have been small;\r\nyet the more I go into that question the more convinced I feel that\r\nthere was during the Glacial period some migration from north to south.\r\nThe sketch in the \"Origin\" gives a very meagre account of my fuller MS.\r\nessay on this subject.\r\n\r\nI shall be particularly obliged for a copy of your paper when published\r\n(118/2. Probably a paper by Bates entitled \"Contributions to an Insect\r\nFauna of the Amazon Valley\" (\"Trans. Entomol. Soc.\" Volume V., page 335,\r\n1858-61).); and if any suggestions occur to me (not that you require\r\nany) or questions, I will write and ask.\r\n\r\nI have at once to prepare a new edition of the \"Origin,\" (118/3. Third\r\nEdition, March, 1861.), and I will do myself the pleasure of sending you\r\na copy; but it will be only very slightly altered.\r\n\r\nCases of neuter ants, divided into castes, with intermediate gradations\r\n(which I imagine are rare) interest me much. See \"Origin\" on the\r\ndriver-ant, page 241 (please look at the passage.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 119. TO T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n(119/1. This refers to the first number of the new series of the\r\n\"Natural History Review,\" 1861, a periodical which Huxley was largely\r\ninstrumental in founding, and of which he was an editor (see Letter\r\n107). The first series was published in Dublin, and ran to seven volumes\r\nbetween 1854 and 1860. The new series came to an end in 1865.)\r\n\r\nDown, January, 3rd [1861].\r\n\r\nI have just finished No. 1 of the \"Natural History Review,\" and must\r\ncongratulate you, as chiefly concerned, on its excellence. The whole\r\nseems to me admirable,--so admirable that it is impossible that other\r\nnumbers should be so good, but it would be foolish to expect it. I am\r\nrather a croaker, and I do rather fear that the merit of the articles\r\nwill be above the run of common readers and subscribers. I have been\r\nmuch interested by your brain article. (119/2. The \"Brain article\" of\r\nHuxley bore the title \"On the Zoological Relations of Man with the\r\nLower Animals,\" and appeared in No. 1, January 1861, page 67. It was Mr.\r\nHuxley's vindication of the unqualified contradiction given by him\r\nat the Oxford meeting of the British Association to Professor Owen's\r\nassertions as to the difference between the brains of man and the higher\r\napes. The sentence omitted by Owen in his lecture before the University\r\nof Cambridge was a footnote on the close structural resemblance between\r\nHomo and Pithecus, which occurs in his paper on the characters of the\r\nclass Mammalia in the \"Linn. Soc. Journal,\" Volume II., 1857, page 20.\r\nAccording to Huxley the lecture, or \"Essay on the Classification of the\r\nMammalia,\" was, with this omission, a reprint of the Linnean paper. In\r\n\"Man's Place in Nature,\" page 110, note, Huxley remarks: \"Surely it is\r\na little singular that the 'anatomist,' who finds it 'difficult' to\r\n'determine the difference' between Homo and Pithecus, should yet range\r\nthem, on anatomical grounds, in distinct sub-classes.\") What a complete\r\nand awful smasher (and done like a \"buttered angel\") it is for Owen!\r\nWhat a humbug he is to have left out the sentence in the lecture before\r\nthe orthodox Cambridge dons! I like Lubbock's paper very much: how well\r\nhe writes. (119/3. Sir John Lubbock's paper was a review of Leydig on\r\nthe Daphniidae. M'Donnell's was \"On the Homologies of the Electric Organ\r\nof the Torpedo,\" afterwards used in the \"Origin\" (see Edition VI., page\r\n150).) M'Donnell, of course, pleases me greatly. But I am very curious\r\nto know who wrote the Protozoa article: I shall hear, if it be not a\r\nsecret, from Lubbock. It strikes me as very good, and, by Jove, how Owen\r\nis shown up--\"this great and sound reasoner\"! By the way, this reminds\r\nme of a passage which I have just observed in Owen's address at Leeds,\r\nwhich a clever reviewer might turn into good fun. He defines (page xc)\r\nand further on amplifies his definition that creation means \"a process\r\nhe knows not what.\" And in a previous sentence he says facts shake his\r\nconfidence that the Apteryx in New Zealand and Red Grouse in England are\r\n\"distinct creations.\" So that he has no confidence that these birds\r\nwere produced by \"processes he knows not what!\" To what miserable\r\ninconsistencies and rubbish this truckling to opposite opinions leads\r\nthe great generaliser! (119/4. In the \"Historical Sketch,\" which forms\r\npart of the later editions of the \"Origin,\" Mr. Darwin made use of\r\nOwen's Leeds Address in the manner sketched above. See \"Origin,\" Edition\r\nVI., page xvii.)\r\n\r\nFarewell: I heartily rejoice in the clear merit of this number. I hope\r\nMrs. Huxley goes on well. Etty keeps much the same, but has not got up\r\nto the same pitch as when you were here. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 120. TO JAMES LAMONT. Down, February 25th [1861].\r\n\r\nI am extremely much obliged for your very kind present of your beautiful\r\nwork, \"Seasons with the Sea-Horses;\" and I have no doubt that I shall\r\nfind much interesting from so careful and acute an observer as yourself.\r\n(120/1. \"Seasons with the Sea-Horses; or, Sporting Adventures in the\r\nNorthern Seas.\" London, 1861. Mr. Lamont (loc. cit., page 273) writes:\r\n\"The polar bear seems to me to be nothing more than a variety of the\r\nbears inhabiting Northern Europe, Asia, and America; and it surely\r\nrequires no very great stretch of the imagination to suppose that\r\nthis variety was originally created, not as we see him now, but by\r\nindividuals of Ursus arctos in Siberia, who, finding their means of\r\nsubsistence running short, and pressed by hunger, ventured on the ice\r\nand caught some seals. These individuals would find that they could\r\nmake a subsistence in this way, and would take up their residence on the\r\nshore and gradually take to a life on the ice...Then it stands to reason\r\nthat those individuals who might happen to be palest in colour would\r\nhave the best chance of succeeding in surprising seals...The process\r\nof Natural Selection would do the rest, and Ursus arctos would in the\r\ncourse of a few thousands, or a few millions of years, be transformed\r\ninto the variety at present known as Ursus maritimus.\" The author adds\r\nthe following footnote (op. cit., page 275): \"It will be obvious to\r\nany one that I follow Mr. Darwin in these remarks; and, although the\r\nsubstance of this chapter was written in Spitzbergen, before \"The Origin\r\nof Species\" was published, I do not claim any originality for my views;\r\nand I also cheerfully acknowledge that, but for the publication of that\r\nwork in connection with the name of so distinguished a naturalist, I\r\nnever would have ventured to give to the world my own humble opinions on\r\nthe subject.\")\r\n\r\nP.S. I have just been cutting the leaves of your book, and have been\r\nvery much pleased and surprised at your note about what you wrote in\r\nSpitzbergen. As you thought it out independently, it is no wonder\r\nthat you so clearly understand Natural Selection, which so few of my\r\nreviewers do or pretend not to do.\r\n\r\nI never expected to see any one so heroically bold as to defend my\r\nbear illustration. (120/2. \"In North America the black bear was seen by\r\nHearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus catching, almost\r\nlike a whale, insects in the water.\"--\"Origin,\" Edition VI., page 141.\r\nSee Letter 110.) But a man who has done all that you have done must be\r\nbold! It is laughable how often I have been attacked and misrepresented\r\nabout this bear. I am much pleased with your remarks, and thank you\r\ncordially for coming to the rescue.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 121. TO W.B. TEGETMEIER.\r\n\r\n(121/1. Mr. Darwin's letters to Mr. Tegetmeier, taken as a whole, give a\r\nstriking picture of the amount of assistance which Darwin received from\r\nhim during many years. Some citations from these letters given in \"Life\r\nand Letters,\" II., pages 52, 53, show how freely and generously Mr.\r\nTegetmeier gave his help, and how much his co-operation was valued.\r\n\r\nThe following letter is given as an example of the questions on which\r\nDarwin sought Mr. Tegetmeier's opinion and guidance.)\r\n\r\nDown, March 22 [1861].\r\n\r\nI ought to have answered your last note sooner; but I have been very\r\nbusy. How wonderfully successful you have been in breeding Pouters! You\r\nhave a good right to be proud of your accuracy of eye and judgment. I\r\nam in the thick of poultry, having just commenced, and shall be truly\r\ngrateful for the skulls, if you can send them by any conveyance to the\r\nNag's Head next Thursday.\r\n\r\nYou ask about vermilion wax: positively it was not in the state of comb,\r\nbut in solid bits and cakes, which were thrown with other rubbish not\r\nfar from my hives. You can make any use of the fact you like. Combs\r\ncould be concentrically and variously coloured and dates recorded by\r\ngiving for a few days wax darkly coloured with vermilion and indigo,\r\nand I daresay other substances. You ask about my crossed fowls, and this\r\nleads me to make a proposition to you, which I hope cannot be offensive\r\nto you. I trust you know me too well to think that I would propose\r\nanything objectionable to the best of my judgment. The case is this: for\r\nmy object of treating poultry I must give a sketch of several breeds,\r\nwith remarks on various points. I do not feel strong on the subject.\r\nNow, when my MS. is fairly copied in an excellent handwriting, would\r\nyou read it over, which would take you at most an hour or two, and make\r\ncomments in pencil on it; and accept, like a barrister, a fee, we will\r\nsay, of a couple of guineas. This would be a great assistance to me,\r\nspecially if you would allow me to put a note, stating that you, a\r\ndistinguished judge and fancier, had read it over. I would state that\r\nyou doubted or concurred, as each case might be, of course striking out\r\nwhat you were sure was incorrect. There would be little new in my MS. to\r\nyou; but if by chance you used any of my facts or conclusions before I\r\npublished, I should wish you to state that they were on my authority;\r\notherwise I shall be accused of stealing from you. There will be little\r\nnew, except that perhaps I have consulted some out-of-the-way books, and\r\nhave corresponded with some good authorities. Tell me frankly what you\r\nthink of this; but unless you will oblige me by accepting remuneration,\r\nI cannot and will not give you such trouble. I have little doubt that\r\nseveral points will arise which will require investigation, as I care\r\nfor many points disregarded by fanciers; and according to any time thus\r\nspent, you will, I trust, allow me to make remuneration. I hope that\r\nyou will grant me this favour. There is one assistance which I will now\r\nventure to beg of you--viz., to get me, if you can, another specimen\r\nof an old white Angora rabbit. I want it dead for the skeleton; and not\r\nknocked on the head. Secondly, I see in the \"Cottage Gardener\" (March\r\n19th, page 375) there are impure half-lops with one ear quite upright\r\nand shorter than the other lopped ear. I much want a dead one. Baker\r\ncannot get one. Baily is looking out; but I want two specimens. Can you\r\nassist me, if you meet any rabbit-fancier? I have had rabbits with\r\none ear more lopped than the other; but I want one with one ear quite\r\nupright and shorter, and the other quite long and lopped.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 122. TO H.W. BATES. Down, March 26th [1861].\r\n\r\nI have read your papers with extreme interest, and I have carefully read\r\nevery word of them. (122/1. \"Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the\r\nAmazon Valley.\" (Read March 5th and November 24th, 1860). \"Entomological\r\nSoc. Trans.\" V., pages 223 and 335).) They seem to me to be far richer\r\nin facts of variation, and especially on the distribution of varieties\r\nand subspecies, than anything which I have read. Hereafter I shall\r\nre-read them, and hope in my future work to profit by them and make use\r\nof them. The amount of variation has much surprised me. The analogous\r\nvariation of distinct species in the same regions strikes me as\r\nparticularly curious. The greater variability of the female sex is new\r\nto me. Your Guiana case seems in some degree analogous, as far as plants\r\nare concerned, with the modern plains of La Plata, which seem to\r\nhave been colonised from the north, but the species have been hardly\r\nmodified. (122/2. Mr. Bates (page 349) gives reason to believe that the\r\nGuiana region should be considered \"a perfectly independent province,\"\r\nand that it has formed a centre \"whence radiated the species which now\r\npeople the low lands on its borders.\")\r\n\r\nWould you kindly answer me two or three questions if in your power? When\r\nspecies A becomes modified in another region into a well-marked form C,\r\nbut is connected with it by one (or more) gradational forms B inhabiting\r\nan intermediate region; does this form B generally exist in equal\r\nnumbers with A and C, OR INHABIT AN EQUALLY LARGE AREA? The probability\r\nis that you cannot answer this question, though one of your cases seems\r\nto bear on it...\r\n\r\nYou will, I think, be glad to hear that I now often hear of naturalists\r\naccepting my views more or less fully; but some are curiously cautious\r\nin running the risk of any small odium in expressing their belief.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 123. TO H.W. BATES. Down, April 4th [1861].\r\n\r\nI have been unwell, so have delayed thanking you for your admirable\r\nletter. I hope you will not think me presumptuous in saying how much\r\nI have been struck with your varied knowledge, and with the decisive\r\nmanner in which you bring it to bear on each point,--a rare and most\r\nhigh quality, as far as my experience goes. I earnestly hope you will\r\nfind time to publish largely: before the Linnean Society you might bring\r\nboldly out your views on species. Have you ever thought of publishing\r\nyour travels, and working in them the less abstruse parts of your\r\nNatural History? I believe it would sell, and be a very valuable\r\ncontribution to Natural History. You must also have seen a good deal of\r\nthe natives. I know well it would be quite unreasonable to ask for any\r\nfurther information from you; but I will just mention that I am now, and\r\nshall be for a long time, writing on domestic varieties of all animals.\r\nAny facts would be useful, especially any showing that savages take any\r\ncare in breeding their animals, or in rejecting the bad and preserving\r\nthe good; or any fancies which they may have that one coloured or marked\r\ndog, etc., is better than another. I have already collected much on this\r\nhead, but am greedy for facts. You will at once see their bearing on\r\nvariation under domestication.\r\n\r\nHardly anything in your letter has pleased me more than about sexual\r\nselection. In my larger MS. (and indeed in the \"Origin\" with respect\r\nto the tuft of hairs on the breast of the cock-turkey) I have guarded\r\nmyself against going too far; but I did not at all know that male and\r\nfemale butterflies haunted rather different sites. If I had to cut up\r\nmyself in a review I would have [worried?] and quizzed sexual selection;\r\ntherefore, though I am fully convinced that it is largely true, you may\r\nimagine how pleased I am at what you say on your belief. This part\r\nof your letter to me is a quintessence of richness. The fact about\r\nbutterflies attracted by coloured sepals is another good fact, worth its\r\nweight in gold. It would have delighted the heart of old Christian C.\r\nSprengel--now many years in his grave.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that you have specially attended to \"mimetic\"\r\nanalogies--a most curious subject; I hope you publish on it. I have\r\nfor a long time wished to know whether what Dr. Collingwood asserts\r\nis true--that the most striking cases generally occur between insects\r\ninhabiting the same country.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 124. TO F.W. HUTTON. Down, April 20th [1861].\r\n\r\nI hope that you will permit me to thank you for sending me a copy of\r\nyour paper in \"The Geologist\" (124/1. In a letter to Hooker (April\r\n23rd?, 1861) Darwin refers to Hutton's review as \"very original,\" and\r\nadds that Hutton is \"one of the very few who see that the change of\r\nspecies cannot be directly proved...\" (\"Life and Letters,\" II., page\r\n362). The review appeared in \"The Geologist\" (afterwards known as \"The\r\nGeological Magazine\") for 1861, pages 132-6 and 183-8. A letter on\r\n\"Difficulties of Darwinism\" is published in the same volume of \"The\r\nGeologist,\" page 286.), and at the same time to express my opinion\r\nthat you have done the subject a real service by the highly original,\r\nstriking, and condensed manner with which you have put the case. I am\r\nactually weary of telling people that I do not pretend to adduce direct\r\nevidence of one species changing into another, but that I believe that\r\nthis view in the main is correct, because so many phenomena can be thus\r\ngrouped together and explained. But it is generally of no use; I cannot\r\nmake persons see this. I generally throw in their teeth the universally\r\nadmitted theory of the undulation of light,--neither the undulation nor\r\nthe very existence of ether being proved, yet admitted because the view\r\nexplains so much. You are one of the very few who have seen this, and\r\nhave now put it most forcibly and clearly. I am much pleased to see\r\nhow carefully you have read my book, and, what is far more important,\r\nreflected on so many points with an independent spirit. As I am deeply\r\ninterested in the subject (and I hope not exclusively under a personal\r\npoint of view) I could not resist venturing to thank you for the right\r\ngood service which you have done.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that this note requires no answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 125. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(125/1. Parts of this letter are published in \"Life and Letters,\" II.,\r\npage 362.)\r\n\r\nDown, [April] 23rd, [1861].\r\n\r\nI have been much interested by Bentham's paper in the \"Natural History\r\nReview,\" but it would not, of course, from familiarity, strike you as\r\nit did me. (125/2. This refers to Bentham's paper \"On the Species and\r\nGenera of Plants, etc.\" \"Nat. Hist. Review,\" April, 1861, page 133,\r\nwhich is founded on, or extracted from, a paper read before the Linn.\r\nSoc., November 15th, 1858. It had been originally set down to be read\r\non July 1st, 1858, but gave way to the papers of Darwin and Wallace.\r\nMr. Bentham has described (\"Life and Letters,\" II., page 294) how he\r\nreluctantly cancelled the parts urging \"original fixity\" of specific\r\ntype, and the remainder seems not to have been published except in the\r\nabove-quoted paper in the \"Nat. Hist. Review.\") I liked the whole--all\r\nthe facts on the nature of close and varying species. Good Heavens! to\r\nthink of the British botanists turning up their noses and saying that\r\nhe knows nothing of British plants! I was also pleased at his remarks on\r\nclassification, because it showed me that I wrote truly on this subject\r\nin the \"Origin.\" I saw Bentham at the Linnean Society, and had some talk\r\nwith him and Lubbock and Edgeworth, Wallich, and several others. I asked\r\nBentham to give us his ideas of species; whether partially with us or\r\ndead against us, he would write excellent matter. He made no answer, but\r\nhis manner made me think he might do so if urged--so do you attack him.\r\nEvery one was speaking with affection and anxiety of Henslow. I dined\r\nwith Bell at the Linnean Club, and liked my dinner...dining-out is such\r\na novelty to me that I enjoyed it. Bell has a real good heart. I\r\nliked Rolleston's paper, but I never read anything so obscure and not\r\nself-evident as his \"canons.\" (125/3. See \"Nat. Hist. Review,\" 1861,\r\npage 206. The paper is \"On the Brain of the Orang Utang,\" and forms part\r\nof the bitter controversy of this period to which reference occurs in\r\nletters to Huxley and elsewhere in these volumes. Rolleston's work is\r\nquoted by Huxley (\"Man's Place in Nature,\" page 117) as part of the\r\ncrushing refutation of Owen's position. Mr. Huxley's letter referred to\r\nabove is no doubt that in the \"Athenaeum,\" April 13th, 1861, page 498;\r\nit is certainly severe, but to those who know Mr. Huxley's \"Succinct\r\nHistory of the Controversy,\" etc. (\"Man's Place in Nature,\" page 113),\r\nit will not seem too severe.) I had a dim perception of the truth of\r\nyour profound remark--that he wrote in fear and trembling \"of God, man,\r\nand monkeys,\" but I would alter it into \"God, man, Owen, and monkeys.\"\r\nHuxley's letter was truculent, and I see that every one thinks it\r\ntoo truculent; but in simple truth I am become quite demoniacal about\r\nOwen--worse than Huxley; and I told Huxley that I should put myself\r\nunder his care to be rendered milder. But I mean to try and get more\r\nangelic in my feelings; yet I never shall forget his cordial shake of\r\nthe hand, when he was writing as spitefully as he possibly could against\r\nme. But I have always thought that you have more cause than I to be\r\ndemoniacally inclined towards him. Bell told me that Owen says that the\r\neditor mutilated his article in the \"Edinburgh Review\" (125/4. This is\r\nthe only instance, with which we are acquainted, of Owen's acknowledging\r\nthe authorship of the \"Edinburgh Review\" article.), and Bell seemed to\r\nthink it was rendered more spiteful by the Editor; perhaps the opposite\r\nview is as probable. Oh, dear! this does not look like becoming more\r\nangelic in my temper!\r\n\r\nI had a splendid long talk with Lyell (you may guess how splendid, for\r\nhe was many times on his knees, with elbows on the sofa) (125/5. Mr.\r\nDarwin often spoke of Sir Charles Lyell's tendency to take curious\r\nattitudes when excited.) on his work in France: he seems to have done\r\ncapital work in making out the age of the celt-bearing beds, but the\r\ncase gets more and more complicated. All, however, tends to greater and\r\ngreater antiquity of man. The shingle beds seem to be estuary deposits.\r\nI called on R. Chambers at his very nice house in St. John's Wood, and\r\nhad a very pleasant half-hour's talk--he is really a capital fellow. He\r\nmade one good remark and chuckled over it: that the laymen universally\r\nhad treated the controversy on the \"Essays and Reviews\" as a merely\r\nprofessional subject, and had not joined in it but had left it to the\r\nclergy. I shall be anxious for your next letter about Henslow. Farewell,\r\nwith sincere sympathy, my old friend.\r\n\r\nP.S.--We are very much obliged for \"London Review.\" We like reading much\r\nof it, and the science is incomparably better than in the \"Athenaeum.\"\r\nYou shall not go on very long sending it, as you will be ruined by\r\npennies and trouble; but I am under a horrid spell to the \"Athenaeum\"\r\nand \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" both of which are intolerably dull, but I\r\nhave taken them in for so many years that I cannot give them up.\r\nThe \"Cottage Gardener,\" for my purpose, is now far better than the\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 126. TO J.L.A. DE QUATREFAGES. Down, April 25 [1861].\r\n\r\nI received this morning your \"Unite de l'Espece Humaine\" [published\r\nin 1861], and most sincerely do I thank you for this your very kind\r\npresent. I had heard of and been recommended to read your articles, but,\r\nnot knowing that they were separately published, did not know how to get\r\nthem. So your present is most acceptable, and I am very anxious to\r\nsee your views on the whole subject of species and variation; and I am\r\ncertain to derive much benefit from your work. In cutting the pages I\r\nobserve that you have most kindly mentioned my work several times. My\r\nviews spread slowly in England and America; and I am much surprised to\r\nfind them most commonly accepted by geologists, next by botanists, and\r\nleast by zoologists. I am much pleased that the younger and middle-aged\r\ngeologists are coming round, for the arguments from Geology have always\r\nseemed strongest against me. Not one of the older geologists (except\r\nLyell) has been even shaken in his views of the eternal immutability of\r\nspecies. But so many of the younger men are turning round with zeal\r\nthat I look to the future with some confidence. I am now at work on\r\n\"Variation under Domestication,\" but make slow progress--it is such\r\ntedious work comparing skeletons.\r\n\r\nWith very sincere thanks for the kind sympathy which you have always\r\nshown me, and with much respect,...\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have lately read M. Naudin's paper (126/1. Naudin's paper\r\n(\"Revue Horticole,\" 1852) is mentioned in the \"Historical Sketch\"\r\nprefixed to the later editions of the \"Origin\" (Edition VI., page xix).\r\nNaudin insisted that species are formed in a manner analogous to the\r\nproduction of varieties by cultivators, i.e., by selection, \"but he does\r\nnot show how selection acts under nature.\" In the \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nII., page 246, Darwin, speaking of Naudin's work, says: \"Decaisne seems\r\nto think he gives my whole theory.\"), but it does not seem to me to\r\nanticipate me, as he does not show how selection could be applied under\r\nnature; but an obscure writer (126/2. The obscure writer is Patrick\r\nMatthew (see the \"Historical Sketch\" in the \"Origin.\") on forest\r\ntrees, in 1830, in Scotland, most expressly and clearly anticipated\r\nmy views--though he put the case so briefly that no single person ever\r\nnoticed the scattered passages in his book.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 127. TO L. HINDMARSH.\r\n\r\n(127/1. The following letter was in reply to one from Mr. Hindmarsh, to\r\nwhom Mr. Darwin had written asking for information on the average number\r\nof animals killed each year in the Chillingham herd. The object of the\r\nrequest was to obtain information which might throw light on the rate\r\nof increase of the cattle relatively to those on the pampas of South\r\nAmerica. Mr. Hindmarsh had contributed a paper \"On the Wild Cattle of\r\nChillingham Park\" to the \"Annals and Mag. Nat. Hist.\" Volume II., page\r\n274, 1839.)\r\n\r\nDown, May 12th [1861].\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your prompt and great kindness, and return\r\nthe letter, which I have been very glad to see and have had copied.\r\nThe increase is more rapid than I anticipated, but it seems rather\r\nconjectural; I had hoped that in so interesting a case some exact record\r\nhad been kept. The number of births, or of calves reared till they\r\nfollowed their mothers, would perhaps have been the best datum. From\r\nMr. Hardy's letter I infer that ten must be annually born to make up the\r\ndeaths from various causes. In Paraguay, Azara states that in a herd of\r\n4,000, from 1,000 to 1,300 are reared; but then, though they do not kill\r\ncalves, but castrate the young bulls, no doubt the oxen would be killed\r\nearlier than the cows, so that the herd would contain probably more of\r\nthe female sex than the herd at Chillingham. There is not apparently\r\nany record whether more young bulls are killed than cows. I am surprised\r\nthat Lord Tankerville does not have an exact record kept of deaths\r\nand sexes and births: after a dozen years it would be an interesting\r\nstatistical record to the naturalist and agriculturist.\r\n\r\n\r\n(PLATE: PROFESSOR HENSLOW.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 128. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(128/1. The death of Professor Henslow (who was Sir J.D. Hooker's\r\nfather-in-law) occurred on May 16th, 1861.)\r\n\r\nDown, May 24th [1861].\r\n\r\nThanks for your two notes. I am glad that the burial is over, and\r\nsincerely sympathise and can most fully understand your feelings at your\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nI grieve to think how little I saw of Henslow for many years. With\r\nrespect to a biography of Henslow, I cannot help feeling rather\r\ndoubtful, on the principle that a biography could not do him justice.\r\nHis letters were generally written in a hurry, and I fear he did not\r\nkeep any journal or diary. If there were any vivid materials to describe\r\nhis life as parish priest, and manner of managing the poor, it would be\r\nvery good.\r\n\r\nI am never very sanguine on literary projects. I cannot help fearing\r\nhis Life might turn out flat. There can hardly be marked incidents to\r\ndescribe. I sincerely hope that I take a wrong and gloomy view, but\r\nI cannot help fearing--I would rather see no Life than one that would\r\ninterest very few. It will be a pleasure and duty in me to consider what\r\nI can recollect; but at present I can think of scarcely anything. The\r\nequability and perfection of Henslow's whole character, I should think,\r\nwould make it very difficult for any one to pourtray him. I have been\r\nthinking about Henslow all day a good deal, but the more I think the\r\nless I can think of to write down. It is quite a new style for me to\r\nset about, but I will continue to think what I could say to give any,\r\nhowever imperfect, notion of him in the old Cambridge days.\r\n\r\nPray give my kindest remembrances to L. Jenyns (128/2. The Rev. Leonard\r\nJenyns (afterwards Blomefield) undertook the \"Life\" of Henslow, to which\r\nDarwin contributed a characteristic and delightful sketch. See Letter\r\n17.), who is often associated with my recollection of those old happy\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 129. HENRY FAWCETT TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(129/1. It was in reply to the following letter that Darwin wrote to\r\nFawcett: \"You could not possibly have told me anything which would have\r\ngiven me more satisfaction than what you say about Mr. Mill's opinion.\r\nUntil your review appeared I began to think that perhaps I did not\r\nunderstand at all how to reason scientifically.\" (\"Life of Henry\r\nFawcett,\" by Leslie Stephen, 1885, page 100.)\r\n\r\nBodenham, Salisbury, July 16th [1861].\r\n\r\nI feel that I ought not to have so long delayed writing to thank you\r\nfor your very kind letter to me about my article on your book in\r\n\"Macmillan's Magazine.\"\r\n\r\nI was particularly anxious to point out that the method of investigation\r\npursued was in every respect philosophically correct. I was spending an\r\nevening last week with my friend Mr. John Stuart Mill, and I am sure you\r\nwill be pleased to hear from such an authority that he considers that\r\nyour reasoning throughout is in the most exact accordance with the\r\nstrict principles of logic. He also says the method of investigation you\r\nhave followed is the only one proper to such a subject.\r\n\r\nIt is easy for an antagonistic reviewer, when he finds it difficult\r\nto answer your arguments, to attempt to dispose of the whole matter by\r\nuttering some such commonplace as \"This is not a Baconian induction.\"\r\n\r\nI expect shortly to be spending a few days in your neighbourhood, and if\r\nI should not be intruding upon you, I should esteem it a great favour if\r\nyou will allow me to call on you, and have half an hour's conversation\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am personally concerned, I am sure I ought to be grateful to\r\nyou, for since my accident nothing has given me so much pleasure as the\r\nperusal of your book. Such studies are now a great resource to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 130. TO C. LYELL. 2, Hesketh Terrace, Torquay [August 2nd, 1861].\r\n\r\nI declare that you read the reviews on the \"Origin\" more carefully than\r\nI do. I agree with all your remarks. The point of correlation struck me\r\nas well put, and on varieties growing together; but I have already begun\r\nto put things in train for information on this latter head, on which\r\nBronn also enlarges. With respect to sexuality, I have often speculated\r\non it, and have always concluded that we are too ignorant to speculate:\r\nno physiologist can conjecture why the two elements go to form a new\r\nbeing, and, more than that, why nature strives at uniting the two\r\nelements from two individuals. What I am now working at in my orchids is\r\nan admirable illustration of the law. I should certainly conclude that\r\nall sexuality had descended from one prototype. Do you not underrate the\r\ndegree of lowness of organisation in which sexuality occurs--viz., in\r\nHydra, and still lower in some of the one-celled free confervae which\r\n\"conjugate,\" which good judges (Thwaites) believe is the simplest form\r\nof true sexual generation? (130/1. See Letter 97.) But the whole case is\r\na mystery.\r\n\r\nThere is another point on which I have occasionally wished to say a few\r\nwords. I believe you think with Asa Gray that I have not allowed enough\r\nfor the stream of variation having been guided by a higher power. I have\r\nhad lately a good deal of correspondence on this head. Herschel, in his\r\n\"Physical Geography\" (130/2. \"Physical Geography of the Globe,\" by Sir\r\nJohn F.W. Herschel, Edinburgh, 1861. On page 12 Herschel writes of\r\nthe revelations of Geology pointing to successive submersions and\r\nreconstructions of the continents and fresh races of animals and plants.\r\nHe refers to a \"great law of change\" which has not operated either by\r\na gradually progressing variation of species, nor by a sudden and\r\ntotal abolition of one race...The following footnote on page 12 of\r\nthe \"Physical Geography\" was added in January, 1861: \"This was written\r\nprevious to the publication of Mr. Darwin's work on the \"Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" a work which, whatever its merit or ingenuity, we cannot,\r\nhowever, consider as having disproved the view taken in the text. We\r\ncan no more accept the principle of arbitrary and casual variation\r\nand natural selection as a sufficient account, per se, of the past\r\nand present organic world, than we can receive the Laputan method of\r\ncomposing books (pushed a outrance) as a sufficient one of Shakespeare\r\nand the \"Principia.\" Equally in either case an intelligence, guided by\r\na purpose, must be continually in action to bias the directions of the\r\nsteps of change--to regulate their amount, to limit their divergence,\r\nand to continue them in a definite course. We do not believe that Mr.\r\nDarwin means to deny the necessity of such intelligent direction. But it\r\ndoes not, so far as we can see, enter into the formula of this law, and\r\nwithout it we are unable to conceive how far the law can have led to\r\nthe results. On the other hand, we do not mean to deny that such\r\nintelligence may act according to a law (that is to say, on a\r\npreconceived and definite plan). Such law, stated in words, would be\r\nno other than the actual observed law of organic succession; a one more\r\ngeneral, taking that form when applied to our own planet, and including\r\nall the links of the chain which have disappeared. BUT THE ONE LAW IS A\r\nNECESSARY SUPPLEMENT TO THE OTHER, AND OUGHT, IN ALL LOGICAL PROPRIETY,\r\nTO FORM A PART OF ITS ENUNCIATION. Granting this, and with some demur\r\nas to the genesis of man, we are far from disposed to repudiate the view\r\ntaken of this mysterious subject in Mr. Darwin's book.\" The sentence\r\nin italics is no doubt the one referred to in the letter to Lyell. See\r\nLetter 243.), has a sentence with respect to the \"Origin,\" something to\r\nthe effect that the higher law of Providential Arrangement should always\r\nbe stated. But astronomers do not state that God directs the course\r\nof each comet and planet. The view that each variation has been\r\nprovidentially arranged seems to me to make Natural Selection entirely\r\nsuperfluous, and indeed takes the whole case of the appearance of new\r\nspecies out of the range of science. But what makes me most object to\r\nAsa Gray's view is the study of the extreme variability of domestic\r\nanimals. He who does not suppose that each variation in the pigeon was\r\nprovidentially caused, by accumulating which variations, man made\r\na Fantail, cannot, I think, logically argue that the tail of the\r\nwoodpecker was formed by variations providentially ordained. It seems\r\nto me that variations in the domestic and wild conditions are due to\r\nunknown causes, and are without purpose, and in so far accidental; and\r\nthat they become purposeful only when they are selected by man for his\r\npleasure, or by what we call Natural Selection in the struggle for life,\r\nand under changing conditions. I do not wish to say that God did not\r\nforesee everything which would ensue; but here comes very nearly the\r\nsame sort of wretched imbroglio as between freewill and preordained\r\nnecessity. I doubt whether I have made what I think clear; but certainly\r\nA. Gray's notion of the courses of variation having been led like a\r\nstream of water by gravity, seems to me to smash the whole affair. It\r\nreminds me of a Spaniard whom I told I was trying to make out how the\r\nCordillera was formed; and he answered me that it was useless, for \"God\r\nmade them.\" It may be said that God foresaw how they would be made.\r\nI wonder whether Herschel would say that you ought always to give the\r\nhigher providential law, and declare that God had ordered all certain\r\nchanges of level, that certain mountains should arise. I must think\r\nthat such views of Asa Gray and Herschel merely show that the subject in\r\ntheir minds is in Comte's theological stage of science...\r\n\r\nOf course I do not want any answer to my quasi-theological discussion,\r\nbut only for you to think of my notions, if you understand them.\r\n\r\nI hope to Heaven your long and great labours on your new edition are\r\ndrawing to a close.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 131. TO C. LYELL. Torquay, [August 13th, 1861].\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for the orchids, which have proved extremely useful to\r\nme in two ways I did not anticipate, but were too monstrous (yet of some\r\nuse) for my special purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen you come to \"Deification\" (131/1. See Letter 105, note.), ask\r\nyourself honestly whether what you are thinking applies to the endless\r\nvariations of domestic productions, which man accumulates for his mere\r\nfancy or use. No doubt these are all caused by some unknown law, but\r\nI cannot believe they were ordained for any purpose, and if not so\r\nordained under domesticity, I can see no reason to believe that they\r\nwere ordained in a state of nature. Of course it may be said, when you\r\nkick a stone, or a leaf falls from a tree, that it was ordained, before\r\nthe foundations of the world were laid, exactly where that stone or leaf\r\nshould lie. In this sense the subject has no interest for me.\r\n\r\nOnce again, many thanks for the orchids; you must let me repay you what\r\nyou paid the collector.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 132. TO C. LYELL.\r\n\r\n(132/1. The first paragraph probably refers to the proof-sheets of\r\nLyell's \"Antiquity of Man,\" but the passage referred to seems not to\r\noccur in the book.)\r\n\r\nTorquay, August 21st [1861].\r\n\r\n...I have really no criticism, except a trifling one in pencil near the\r\nend, which I have inserted on account of dominant and important species\r\ngenerally varying most. You speak of \"their views\" rather as if you were\r\na thousand miles away from such wretches, but your concluding paragraph\r\nshows that you are one of the wretches.\r\n\r\nI am pleased that you approve of Hutton's review. (132/2. \"Some Remarks\r\non Mr. Darwin's Theory,\" by F.W. Hutton. \"Geologist,\" Volume IV.,\r\npage 132 (1861). See Letter 124.) It seemed to me to take a more\r\nphilosophical view of the manner of judging the question than any other\r\nreview. The sentence you quote from it seems very true, but I do not\r\nagree with the theological conclusion. I think he quotes from Asa Gray,\r\ncertainly not from me; but I have neither A. Gray nor \"Origin\" with me.\r\nIndeed, I have over and over again said in the \"Origin\" that Natural\r\nSelection does nothing without variability; I have given a whole chapter\r\non laws, and used the strongest language how ignorant we are on these\r\nlaws. But I agree that I have somehow (Hooker says it is owing to\r\nmy title) not made the great and manifest importance of previous\r\nvariability plain enough. Breeders constantly speak of Selection as\r\nthe one great means of improvement; but of course they imply individual\r\ndifferences, and this I should have thought would have been obvious to\r\nall in Natural Selection; but it has not been so.\r\n\r\nI have just said that I cannot agree with \"which variations are the\r\neffects of an unknown law, ordained and guided without doubt by an\r\nintelligent cause on a preconceived and definite plan.\" Will you\r\nhonestly tell me (and I should be really much obliged) whether you\r\nbelieve that the shape of my nose (eheu!) was ordained and \"guided by\r\nan intelligent cause?\" (132/3. It should be remembered that the shape\r\nof his nose nearly determined Fitz-Roy to reject Darwin as naturalist to\r\nH.M.S. \"Beagle\" (\"Life and Letters,\" I., page 60).) By the selection of\r\nanalogous and less differences fanciers make almost generic differences\r\nin their pigeons; and can you see any good reason why the Natural\r\nSelection of analogous individual differences should not make new\r\nspecies? If you say that God ordained that at some time and place a\r\ndozen slight variations should arise, and that one of them alone should\r\nbe preserved in the struggle for life and the other eleven should perish\r\nin the first or few first generations, then the saying seems to me\r\nmere verbiage. It comes to merely saying that everything that is, is\r\nordained.\r\n\r\nLet me add another sentence. Why should you or I speak of variation\r\nas having been ordained and guided, more than does an astronomer, in\r\ndiscussing the fall of a meteoric stone? He would simply say that it was\r\ndrawn to our earth by the attraction of gravity, having been displaced\r\nin its course by the action of some quite unknown laws. Would you have\r\nhim say that its fall at some particular place and time was \"ordained\r\nand guided without doubt by an intelligent cause on a preconceived and\r\ndefinite plan\"? Would you not call this theological pedantry or display?\r\nI believe it is not pedantry in the case of species, simply because\r\ntheir formation has hitherto been viewed as beyond law; in fact, this\r\nbranch of science is still with most people under its theological phase\r\nof development. The conclusion which I always come to after thinking of\r\nsuch questions is that they are beyond the human intellect; and the less\r\none thinks on them the better. You may say, Then why trouble me? But I\r\nshould very much like to know clearly what you think.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 133. TO HENRY FAWCETT.\r\n\r\n(133/1. The following letter was published in the \"Life\" of Mr. Fawcett\r\n(1885); we are indebted to Mrs. Fawcett and Messrs. Smith & Elder for\r\npermission to reprint it. See Letter 129.)\r\n\r\nSeptember 18th [1861].\r\n\r\nI wondered who had so kindly sent me the newspaper (133/2. The newspaper\r\nsent was the \"Manchester Examiner\" for September 9th, 1861, containing\r\na report of Mr. Fawcett's address given before Section D of the British\r\nAssociation, \"On the method of Mr. Darwin in his treatise on the\r\norigin of species,\" in which the speaker showed that the \"method of\r\ninvestigation pursued by Mr. Darwin in his treatise on the origin of\r\nspecies is in strict accordance with the principles of logic.\" The \"A\"\r\nof the letter (as published in Fawcett's Life) is the late Professor\r\nWilliamson, who is reported to have said that \"while he would not say\r\nthat Mr. Darwin's book had caused him a loss of reputation, he was sure\r\nthat it had not caused a gain.\" The reference to \"B\" is explained by the\r\nreport of the late Dr. Lankester's speech in which he said, \"The facts\r\nbrought forward in support of the hypothesis had a very different value\r\nindeed from that of the hypothesis...A great naturalist, who was still a\r\nfriend of Mr. Darwin, once said to him (Dr. Lankester), 'The mistake is,\r\nthat Darwin has dealt with origin. Why did he not put his facts before\r\nus, and let them rest?'\" Another speaker, the Rt. Hon. J.R. Napier,\r\nremarked: \"I am going to speak closely to the question. If the\r\nhypothesis is put forward to contradict facts, and the averments are\r\ncontrary to the Word of God, I say that it is not a logical argument.\"\r\nAt this point the chairman, Professor Babington, wisely interfered, on\r\nthe ground that the meeting was a scientific one.), which I was very\r\nglad to see; and now I have to thank you sincerely for allowing me to\r\nsee your MS. It seems to me very good and sound; though I am certainly\r\nnot an impartial judge. You will have done good service in calling the\r\nattention of scientific men to means and laws of philosophising. As far\r\nas I could judge by the papers, your opponents were unworthy of you. How\r\nmiserably A. talked of my reputation, as if that had anything to do with\r\nit!...How profoundly ignorant B must be of the very soul of observation!\r\nAbout thirty years ago there was much talk that geologists ought only\r\nto observe and not theorise; and I well remember some one saying that at\r\nthis rate a man might as well go into a gravel-pit and count the pebbles\r\nand describe the colours. How odd it is that anyone should not see that\r\nall observation must be for or against some view if it is to be of any\r\nservice!\r\n\r\nI have returned only lately from a two months' visit to Torquay,\r\nwhich did my health at the time good; but I am one of those miserable\r\ncreatures who are never comfortable for twenty-four hours; and it is\r\nclear to me that I ought to be exterminated. I have been rather idle of\r\nlate, or, speaking more strictly, working at some miscellaneous papers,\r\nwhich, however, have some direct bearing on the subject of species; yet\r\nI feel guilty at having neglected my larger book. But, to me, observing\r\nis much better sport than writing. I fear that I shall have wearied you\r\nwith this long note.\r\n\r\nPray believe that I feel sincerely grateful that you have taken up the\r\ncudgels in defence of the line of argument in the \"Origin;\" you will\r\nhave benefited the subject.\r\n\r\nMany are so fearful of speaking out. A German naturalist came here the\r\nother day; and he tells me that there are many in Germany on our side,\r\nbut that all seem fearful of speaking out, and waiting for some one to\r\nspeak, and then many will follow. The naturalists seem as timid as\r\nyoung ladies should be, about their scientific reputation. There is much\r\ndiscussion on the subject on the Continent, even in quiet Holland; and I\r\nhad a pamphlet from Moscow the other day by a man who sticks up famously\r\nfor the imperfection of the \"Geological Record,\" but complains that I\r\nhave sadly understated the variability of the old fossilised animals!\r\nBut I must not run on.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 134. TO H.W. BATES. Down, September 25th [1861].\r\n\r\nNow for a few words on science. Many thanks for facts on neuters. You\r\ncannot tell how I rejoice that you do not think what I have said on the\r\nsubject absurd. Only two persons have even noticed it to me--viz.,\r\nthe bitter sneer of Owen in the \"Edinburgh Review\" (134/1. \"Edinburgh\r\nReview,\" April, 1860, page 525.), and my good friend and supporter,\r\nSir C. Lyell, who could only screw up courage to say, \"Well, you have\r\nmanfully faced the difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful case of Volucella of which I had never heard. (134/2.\r\nVolucella is a fly--one of the Syrphidae--supposed to supply a case of\r\nmimicry; this was doubtless the point of interest with Bates. Dr. Sharp\r\nsays [\"Insects,\" Part II. (in the Camb. Nat. Hist. series), 1899, page\r\n500]: \"It was formerly assumed that the Volucella larvae lived on\r\nthe larvae of the bees, and that the parent flies were providentially\r\nendowed with a bee-like appearance that they might obtain entrance into\r\nthe bees' nests without being detected.\" Dr. Sharp goes on to say\r\nthat what little is known on the subject supports the belief that the\r\n\"presence of the Volucella in the nests is advantageous to both fly and\r\nbee.\") I had no idea such a case occurred in nature; I must get and see\r\nspecimens in British Museum. I hope and suppose you will give a\r\ngood deal of Natural History in your Travels; every one cares about\r\nants--more notice has been taken about slave-ants in the \"Origin\" than\r\nof any other passage.\r\n\r\nI fully expect to delight in your Travels. Keep to simple style, as in\r\nyour excellent letters,--but I beg pardon, I am again advising.\r\n\r\nWhat a capital paper yours will be on mimetic resemblances! You will\r\nmake quite a new subject of it. I had thought of such cases as a\r\ndifficulty; and once, when corresponding with Dr. Collingwood, I thought\r\nof your explanation; but I drove it from my mind, for I felt that I had\r\nnot knowledge to judge one way or the other. Dr C., I think, states that\r\nthe mimetic forms inhabit the same country, but I did not know whether\r\nto believe him. What wonderful cases yours seem to be! Could you not\r\ngive a few woodcuts in your Travels to illustrate this? I am tired with\r\na hard day's work, so no more, except to give my sincere thanks and\r\nhearty wishes for the success of your Travels.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 135. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 18th [1862].\r\n\r\nYour letter discusses lots of interesting subjects, and I am very glad\r\nyou have sent for your letter to Bates. (135/1. Published in Mr. Clodd's\r\nmemoir of Bates in the \"Naturalist on the Amazons,\" 1892, page l.) What\r\ndo you mean by \"individual plants\"? (135/2. In a letter to Mr. Darwin\r\ndated March 17th, 1862, Sir J.D. Hooker had discussed a supposed\r\ndifference between animals and plants, \"inasmuch as the individual\r\nanimal is certainly changed materially by external conditions, the\r\nlatter (I think) never, except in such a coarse way as stunting or\r\nenlarging--e.g. no increase of cold on the spot, or change of individual\r\nplant from hot to cold, will induce said individual plant to get more\r\nwoolly covering; but I suppose a series of cold seasons would bring\r\nabout such a change in an individual quadruped, just as rowing will\r\nharden hands, etc.\") I fancied a bud lived only a year, and you could\r\nhardly expect any change in that time; but if you call a tree or plant\r\nan individual, you have sporting buds. Perhaps you mean that the\r\nwhole tree does not change. Tulips, in \"breaking,\" change. Fruit seems\r\ncertainly affected by the stock. I think I have (135/3. See note, Letter\r\n16.) got cases of slight change in alpine plants transplanted. All these\r\nsubjects have rather gone out of my head owing to orchids, but I shall\r\nsoon have to enter on them in earnest when I come again to my volume on\r\nvariation under domestication.\r\n\r\n...In the lifetime of an animal you would, I think, find it very\r\ndifficult to show effects of external condition on animals more than\r\nshade and light, good and bad soil, produce on a plant.\r\n\r\nYou speak of \"an inherent tendency to vary wholly independent of\r\nphysical conditions\"! This is a very simple way of putting the case (as\r\nDr. Prosper Lucas also puts it) (135/4. Prosper Lucas, the author of\r\n\"Traite philosophique et physiologique de l'heredite naturelle dans\r\nles etats de sante et de maladie du systeme nerveux\": 2 volumes,\r\nParis, 1847-50.): but two great classes of facts make me think that all\r\nvariability is due to change in the conditions of life: firstly, that\r\nthere is more variability and more monstrosities (and these graduate\r\ninto each other) under unnatural domestic conditions than under nature;\r\nand, secondly, that changed conditions affect in an especial manner the\r\nreproductive organs--those organs which are to produce a new being. But\r\nwhy one seedling out of thousands presents some new character transcends\r\nthe wildest powers of conjecture. It was in this sense that I spoke of\r\n\"climate,\" etc., possibly producing without selection a hooked seed,\r\nor any not great variation. (135/5. This statement probably occurs in a\r\nletter, and not in Darwin's published works.)\r\n\r\nI have for years and years been fighting with myself not to attribute\r\ntoo much to Natural Selection--to attribute something to direct action\r\nof conditions; and perhaps I have too much conquered my tendency to lay\r\nhardly any stress on conditions of life.\r\n\r\nI am not shaken about \"saltus\" (135/6. Sir Joseph had written, March\r\n17th, 1862: \"Huxley is rather disposed to think you have overlooked\r\nsaltus, but I am not sure that he is right--saltus quoad individuals is\r\nnot saltus quoad species--as I pointed out in the Begonia case, though\r\nperhaps that was rather special pleading in the present state of\r\nscience.\" For the Begonia case, see \"Life and Letters,\" II., page\r\n275, also letter 110, page 166.), I did not write without going pretty\r\ncarefully into all the cases of normal structure in animals resembling\r\nmonstrosities which appear per saltus.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 136. TO J.D. HOOKER. 26th [March, 1862].\r\n\r\nThanks also for your own (136/1. See note in Letter 135.) and Bates'\r\nletter now returned. They are both excellent; you have, I think, said\r\nall that can be said against direct effects of conditions, and capitally\r\nput. But I still stick to my own and Bates' side. Nevertheless I am\r\npleased to attribute little to conditions, and I wish I had done what\r\nyou suggest--started on the fundamental principle of variation being\r\nan innate principle, and afterwards made a few remarks showing that\r\nhereafter, perhaps, this principle would be explicable. Whenever my\r\nbook on poultry, pigeons, ducks, and rabbits is published, with all the\r\nmeasurements and weighings of bones, I think you will see that \"use\r\nand disuse\" at least have some effect. I do not believe in perfect\r\nreversion. I rather demur to your doctrine of \"centrifugal variation.\"\r\n(136/2. The \"doctrine of centrifugal variation\" is given in Sir J.D.\r\nHooker's \"Introductory Essay to the Flora of Tasmania\" (Part III. of the\r\nBotany of the Antarctic Expedition), 1859, page viii. In paragraph 10\r\nthe author writes: \"The tendency of varieties, both in nature and under\r\ncultivation...is rather to depart more and more widely from the original\r\ntype than to revert to it.\" In Sir Joseph's letter to Bates (loc. cit.,\r\npage lii) he wrote: \"Darwin also believes in some reversion to type\r\nwhich is opposed to my view of variation.\" It may be noted in this\r\nconnection that Mr. Galton has shown reason to believe in a centripetal\r\ntendency in variation (to use Hooker's phraseology) which is not\r\nidentical with the reversion of cultivated plants to their ancestors,\r\nthe case to which Hooker apparently refers. See \"Natural Inheritance,\"\r\nby F. Galton, 1889.) I suppose you do not agree with or do not remember\r\nmy doctrine of the good of diversification (136/3. Darwin usually used\r\nthe word \"divergence\" in this connection.); this seems to me amply to\r\naccount for variation being centrifugal--if you forget it, look at\r\nthis discussion (page 117 of 3rd edition), it was the best point which,\r\naccording to my notions, I made out, and it has always pleased me. It is\r\nreally curiously satisfactory to me to see so able a man as Bates (and\r\nyourself) believing more fully in Natural Selection than I think I even\r\ndo myself. (136/4. This refers to a very interesting passage in Hooker's\r\nletter to Bates (loc. cit., page liii): \"I am sure that with you, as\r\nwith me, the more you think the less occasion you will see for anything\r\nbut time and natural selection to effect change; and that this view\r\nis the simplest and clearest in the present state of science is one\r\nadvantage, at any rate. Indeed, I think that it is, in the present state\r\nof the inquiry, the legitimate position to take up; it is time enough to\r\nbother our heads with the secondary cause when there is some evidence of\r\nit or some demand for it--at present I do not see one or the other, and\r\nso feel inclined to renounce any other for the present.\") By the way, I\r\nalways boast to you, and so I think Owen will be wrong that my book will\r\nbe forgotten in ten years, for a French edition is now going through the\r\npress and a second German edition wanted. Your long letter to Bates has\r\nset my head working, and makes me repent of the nine months spent on\r\norchids; though I know not why I should not have amused myself on them\r\nas well as slaving on bones of ducks and pigeons, etc. The orchids have\r\nbeen splendid sport, though at present I am fearfully sick of them.\r\n\r\nI enclose a waste copy of woodcut of Mormodes ignea; I wish you had a\r\nplant at Kew, for I am sure its wonderful mechanism and structure would\r\namuse you. Is it not curious the way the labellum sits on the top of the\r\ncolumn?--here insects alight and are beautifully shot, when they touch a\r\ncertain sensitive point, by the pollinia.\r\n\r\nHow kindly you have helped me in my work! Farewell, my dear old fellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 137. TO H.W. BATES. Down, May 4th [1862].\r\n\r\nHearty thanks for your most interesting letter and three very valuable\r\nextracts. I am very glad that you have been looking at the South\r\nTemperate insects. I wish that the materials in the British Museum had\r\nbeen richer; but I should think the case of the South American Carabi,\r\nsupported by some other case, would be worth a paper. To us who theorise\r\nI am sure the case is very important. Do the South American Carabi\r\ndiffer more from the other species than do, for instance, the Siberian\r\nand European and North American and Himalayan (if the genus exists\r\nthere)? If they do, I entirely agree with you that the difference would\r\nbe too great to account for by the recent Glacial period. I agree, also,\r\nwith you in utterly rejecting an independent origin for these Carabi.\r\nThere is a difficulty, as far as I know, in our ignorance whether\r\ninsects change quickly in time; you could judge of this by knowing how\r\nfar closely allied coleoptera generally have much restricted ranges,\r\nfor this almost implies rapid change. What a curious case is offered by\r\nland-shells, which become modified in every sub-district, and have yet\r\nretained the same general structure from very remote geological periods!\r\nWhen working at the Glacial period, I remember feeling much surprised\r\nhow few birds, no mammals, and very few sea-mollusca seemed to have\r\ncrossed, or deeply entered, the inter-tropical regions during the cold\r\nperiod. Insects, from all you say, seem to come under the same category.\r\nPlants seem to migrate more readily than animals. Do not underrate the\r\nlength of Glacial period: Forbes used to argue that it was equivalent to\r\nthe whole of the Pleistocene period in the warmer latitudes. I believe,\r\nwith you, that we shall be driven to an older Glacial period.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to hear about the British Museum; it would be hopeless\r\nto contend against any one supported by Owen. Perhaps another chance\r\nmight occur before very long. How would it be to speak to Owen as soon\r\nas your own mind is made up? From what I have heard, since talking to\r\nyou, I fear the strongest personal interest with a Minister is requisite\r\nfor a pension.\r\n\r\nFarewell, and may success attend the acerrimo pro-pugnatori.\r\n\r\nP.S. I deeply wish you could find some situation in which you could\r\ngive your time to science; it would be a great thing for science and for\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 138. TO J.L.A. DE QUATREFAGES. Down, July 11th [1862].\r\n\r\nI thank you cordially for so kindly and promptly answering my questions.\r\nI will quote some of your remarks. The case seems to me of some\r\nimportance with reference to my heretical notions, for it shows how\r\nlarvae might be modified. I shall not publish, I daresay, for a year,\r\nfor much time is expended in experiments. If within this time you should\r\nacquire any fresh information on the similarity of the moths of distinct\r\nraces, and would allow me to quote any facts on your authority, I should\r\nfeel very grateful.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your great kindness with respect to the translation of\r\nthe \"Origin;\" it is very liberal in you, as we differ to a considerable\r\ndegree. I have been atrociously abused by my religious countrymen; but\r\nas I live an independent life in the country, it does not in the least\r\nhurt me in any way, except indeed when the abuse comes from an old\r\nfriend like Professor Owen, who abuses me and then advances the doctrine\r\nthat all birds are probably descended from one parent.\r\n\r\nI wish the translator (138/1. Mdlle. Royer, who translated the first\r\nFrench edition of the \"Origin.') had known more of Natural History; she\r\nmust be a clever but singular lady, but I never heard of her till she\r\nproposed to translate my book.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 139. TO ASA GRAY. Down, July 23rd [1862].\r\n\r\nI received several days ago two large packets, but have as yet read only\r\nyour letter; for we have been in fearful distress, and I could attend\r\nto nothing. Our poor boy had the rare case of second rash and sore\r\nthroat...; and, as if this was not enough, a most serious attack of\r\nerysipelas, with typhoid symptoms. I despaired of his life; but this\r\nevening he has eaten one mouthful, and I think has passed the crisis. He\r\nhas lived on port wine every three-quarters of an hour, day and night.\r\nThis evening, to our astonishment, he asked whether his stamps were\r\nsafe, and I told him of one sent by you, and that he should see it\r\nto-morrow. He answered, \"I should awfully like to see it now\"; so with\r\ndifficulty he opened his eyelids and glanced at it, and, with a sigh of\r\nsatisfaction, said, \"All right.\" Children are one's greatest happiness,\r\nbut often and often a still greater misery. A man of science ought to\r\nhave none--perhaps not a wife; for then there would be nothing in\r\nthis wide world worth caring for, and a man might (whether he could is\r\nanother question) work away like a Trojan. I hope in a few days to get\r\nmy brains in order, and then I will pick out all your orchid letters,\r\nand return them in hopes of your making use of them...\r\n\r\nOf all the carpenters for knocking the right nail on the head, you are\r\nthe very best; no one else has perceived that my chief interest in my\r\norchid book has been that it was a \"flank movement\" on the enemy. I\r\nlive in such solitude that I hear nothing, and have no idea to what you\r\nallude about Bentham and the orchids and species. But I must enquire.\r\n\r\nBy the way, one of my chief enemies (the sole one who has annoyed me),\r\nnamely Owen, I hear has been lecturing on birds; and admits that all\r\nhave descended from one, and advances as his own idea that the oceanic\r\nwingless birds have lost their wings by gradual disuse. He never alludes\r\nto me, or only with bitter sneers, and coupled with Buffon and the\r\n\"Vestiges.\"\r\n\r\nWell, it has been an amusement to me this first evening, scribbling as\r\negotistically as usual about myself and my doings; so you must forgive\r\nme, as I know well your kind heart will do. I have managed to skim the\r\nnewspaper, but had not heart to read all the bloody details. Good God!\r\nWhat will the end be? Perhaps we are too despondent here; but I must\r\nthink you are too hopeful on your side of the water. I never believed\r\nthe \"canards\" of the army of the Potomac having capitulated. My good\r\ndear wife and self are come to wish for peace at any price. Good night,\r\nmy good friend. I will scribble on no more.\r\n\r\nOne more word. I should like to hear what you think about what I say\r\nin the last chapter of the orchid book on the meaning and cause of the\r\nendless diversity of means for the same general purpose. It bears on\r\ndesign, that endless question. Good night, good night!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 140. TO C. LYELL. 1, Carlton Terrace, Southampton, August 22nd\r\n[1862].\r\n\r\nYou say that the Bishop and Owen will be down on you (140/1. This refers\r\nto the \"Antiquity of Man,\" which was published in 1863.): the latter\r\nhardly can, for I was assured that Owen, in his lectures this spring,\r\nadvanced as a new idea that wingless birds had lost their wings by\r\ndisuse. (140/2. The first paragraph of this letter was published in\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" II., pages 387, 388.) Also that magpies stole\r\nspoons, etc., from a remnant of some instinct like that of the\r\nbower-bird, which ornaments its playing passage with pretty feathers.\r\nIndeed, I am told that he hinted plainly that all birds are descended\r\nfrom one. What an unblushing man he must be to lecture thus after\r\nabusing me so, and never to have openly retracted, or alluded to my\r\nbook!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 141. TO JOHN LUBBOCK (LORD AVEBURY). Cliff Cottage, Bournemouth,\r\nSeptember 5th [1862].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your pleasant note in return for all my stupid trouble.\r\nI did not fully appreciate your insect-diving case (141/1. \"On two\r\nAquatic Hymenoptera, one of which uses its Wings in Swimming.\" By John\r\nLubbock. \"Trans. Linn. Soc.\" Volume XXIV., 1864, pages 135-42.) [Read\r\nMay 7th, 1863.] In this paper Lubbock describes a new species of\r\nPolynema--P. natans--which swims by means of its wings, and is capable\r\nof living under water for several hours; the other species, referred to\r\na new genus Prestwichia, lives under water, holds its wings motionless\r\nand uses its legs as oars.) before your last note, nor had I any idea\r\nthat the fact was new, though new to me. It is really very interesting.\r\nOf course you will publish an account of it. You will then say whether\r\nthe insect can fly well through the air. (141/2. In describing the\r\nhabits of Polynema, Lubbock writes, \"I was unfortunately unable to\r\nascertain whether they could fly\" (loc. cit., page 137).) My wife\r\nasked, \"How did he find that it stayed four hours under water without\r\nbreathing?\" I answered at once: \"Mrs. Lubbock sat four hours watching.\"\r\nI wonder whether I am right.\r\n\r\nI long to be at home and at steady work, and I hope we may be in another\r\nmonth. I fear it is hopeless my coming to you, for I am squashier than\r\never, but hope two shower-baths a day will give me a little strength, so\r\nthat you will, I hope, come to us. It is an age since I have seen you or\r\nany scientific friend.\r\n\r\nI heard from Lyell the other day in the Isle of Wight, and from\r\nHooker in Scotland. About Huxley I know nothing, but I hope his book\r\nprogresses, for I shall be very curious to see it. (141/3. \"Man's Place\r\nin Nature.\" London, 1863.)\r\n\r\nI do nothing here except occasionally look at a few flowers, and there\r\nare very few here, for the country is wonderfully barren.\r\n\r\nSee what it is to be well trained. Horace said to me yesterday, \"If\r\nevery one would kill adders they would come to sting less.\" I\r\nanswered: \"Of course they would, for there would be fewer.\" He replied\r\nindignantly: \"I did not mean that; but the timid adders which run away\r\nwould be saved, and in time would never sting at all.\" Natural selection\r\nof cowards!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 142. H. FALCONER TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(142/1. This refers to the MS. of Falconer's paper \"On the American\r\nFossil Elephant of the Regions bordering the Gulf of Mexico (E. Columbi,\r\nFalc.),\" published in the \"Natural History Review,\" January, 1863, page\r\n43. The section dealing with the bearing of his facts on Darwin's views\r\nis at page 77. He insists strongly (page 78) on the \"persistence and\r\nuniformity of the characters of the molar teeth in the earliest known\r\nmammoth, and his most modern successor.\" Nevertheless, he adds that\r\nthe \"inferences I draw from these facts are not opposed to one of the\r\nleading propositions of Darwin's theory.\" These admissions were the\r\nmore satisfactory since, as Falconer points out (page 77), \"I have been\r\nincluded by him in the category of those who have vehemently maintained\r\nthe persistence of specific characters.\")\r\n\r\n21, Park Crescent, Portland Place, N.W., September 24th [1862].\r\n\r\nDo not be frightened at the enclosure. I wish to set myself right by you\r\nbefore I go to press. I am bringing out a heavy memoir on elephants--an\r\nomnium gatherum affair, with observations on the fossil and recent\r\nspecies. One section is devoted to the persistence in time of the\r\nspecific characters of the mammoth. I trace him from before the Glacial\r\nperiod, through it and after it, unchangeable and unchanged as far as\r\nthe organs of digestion (teeth) and locomotion are concerned. Now, the\r\nGlacial period was no joke: it would have made ducks and drakes of your\r\ndear pigeons and doves.\r\n\r\nWith all my shortcomings, I have such a sincere and affectionate regard\r\nfor you and such admiration of your work, that I should be pained to\r\nfind that I had expressed my honest convictions in a way that would be\r\nopen to any objection by you. The reasoning may be very stupid, but I\r\nbelieve that the observation is sound. Will you, therefore, look over\r\nthe few pages which I have sent, and tell me whether you find any flaw,\r\nor whether you think I should change the form of expression? You have\r\nbeen so unhandsomely and uncandidly dealt with by a friend of yours\r\nand mine that I should be sorry to find myself in the position of an\r\nopponent to you, and more particularly with the chance of making a fool\r\nof myself.\r\n\r\nI met your brother yesterday, who tells me you are coming to town. I\r\nhope you will give me a hail. I long for a jaw with you, and have much\r\nto speak to you about.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen the eclaircissement about the Eocene monkeys\r\nof England. By a touch of the conjuring wand they have been\r\nmetamorphosed--a la Darwin--into Hyracotherian pigs. (142/2. \"On the\r\nHyracotherian Character of the Lower Molars of the supposed Macacus from\r\nthe Eocene Sand of Kyson, Suffolk.\" \"Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.\" Volume X.,\r\n1862, page 240. In this note Owen stated that the teeth which he had\r\nnamed Macacus (\"Ann. Mag.\" 1840, page 191) most probably belonged to\r\nHyracotherium cuniculus. See \"A Catalogue of British Fossil Vertebrata,\"\r\nA.S. Woodward and C.D. Sherborn, 1890, under Hyracotherium, page 356;\r\nalso Zittel's \"Handbuch der Palaeontologie\" Abth. I., Bd. IV., Leipzig,\r\n1891-93, page 703.) Would you believe it? This even is a gross blunder.\r\nThey are not pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 143. TO HUGH FALCONER. Down, October 1st [1862].\r\n\r\nOn my return home yesterday I found your letter and MS., which I have\r\nread with extreme interest. Your note and every word in your paper are\r\nexpressed with the same kind feeling which I have experienced from you\r\never since I have had the happiness of knowing you. I value scientific\r\npraise, but I value incomparably higher such kind feeling as yours.\r\nThere is not a single word in your paper to which I could possibly\r\nobject: I should be mad to do so; its only fault is perhaps its too\r\ngreat kindness. Your case seems the most striking one which I have met\r\nwith of the persistence of specific characters. It is very much the more\r\nstriking as it relates to the molar teeth, which differ so much in the\r\nspecies of the genus, and in which consequently I should have expected\r\nvariation. As I read on I felt not a little dumbfounded, and thought to\r\nmyself that whenever I came to this subject I should have to be savage\r\nagainst myself; and I wondered how savage you would be. I trembled a\r\nlittle. My only hope was that something could be made out of the bog\r\nN. American forms, which you rank as a geographical race; and possibly\r\nhereafter out of the Sicilian species. Guess, then, my satisfaction when\r\nI found that you yourself made a loophole (143/1. This perhaps refers\r\nto a passage (\"N.H. Review,\" 1863, page 79) in which Falconer allows the\r\nexistence of intermediate forms along certain possible lines of descent.\r\nFalconer's reference to the Sicilian elephants is in a note on page 78;\r\nthe bog-elephant is mentioned on page 79.), which I never, of course,\r\ncould have guessed at; and imagine my still greater satisfaction at\r\nyour expressing yourself as an unbeliever in the eternal immutability of\r\nspecies. Your final remarks on my work are too generous, but have given\r\nme not a little pleasure. As for criticisms, I have only small ones.\r\nWhen you speak of \"moderate range of variation\" I cannot but think that\r\nyou ought to remind your readers (though I daresay previously done) what\r\nthe amount is, including the case of the American bog-mammoth. You speak\r\nof these animals as having been exposed to a vast range of climatal\r\nchanges from before to after the Glacial period. I should have thought,\r\nfrom analogy of sea-shells, that by migration (or local extinction when\r\nmigration not possible) these animals might and would have kept under\r\nnearly the same climate.\r\n\r\nA rather more important consideration, as it seems to me, is that the\r\nwhole proboscidean group may, I presume, be looked at as verging towards\r\nextinction: anyhow, the extinction has been complete as far as Europe\r\nand America are concerned. Numerous considerations and facts have led\r\nme in the \"Origin\" to conclude that it is the flourishing or dominant\r\nmembers of each order which generally give rise to new races,\r\nsub-species, and species; and under this point of view I am not at all\r\nsurprised at the constancy of your species. This leads me to remark that\r\nthe sentence at the bottom of page [80] is not applicable to my\r\nviews (143/2. See Falconer at the bottom of page 80: it is the old\r\ndifficulty--how can variability co-exist with persistence of type? In\r\nour copy of the letter the passage is given as occurring on page 60,\r\na slip of the pen for page 80.), though quite applicable to those who\r\nattribute modification to the direct action of the conditions of life.\r\nAn elephant might be more individually variable than any known quadruped\r\n(from the effects of the conditions of life or other innate unknown\r\ncauses), but if these variations did not aid the animal in better\r\nresisting all hostile influences, and therefore making it increase in\r\nnumbers, there would be no tendency to the preservation and accumulation\r\nof such variations--i.e. to the formation of a new race. As the\r\nproboscidean group seems to be from utterly unknown causes a failing\r\ngroup in many parts of the world, I should not have anticipated the\r\nformation of new races.\r\n\r\nYou make important remarks versus Natural Selection, and you will\r\nperhaps be surprised that I do to a large extent agree with you. I could\r\nshow you many passages, written as strongly as I could in the \"Origin,\"\r\ndeclaring that Natural Selection can do nothing without previous\r\nvariability; and I have tried to put equally strongly that variability\r\nis governed by many laws, mostly quite unknown. My title deceives\r\npeople, and I wish I had made it rather different. Your phyllotaxis\r\n(143/3. Falconer, page 80: \"The law of Phyllotaxis...is nearly as\r\nconstant in its manifestation as any of the physical laws connected with\r\nthe material world.\") will serve as example, for I quite agree that the\r\nspiral arrangement of a certain number of whorls of leaves (however that\r\nmay have primordially arisen, and whether quite as invariable as you\r\nstate), governs the limits of variability, and therefore governs what\r\nNatural Selection can do. Let me explain how it arose that I laid so\r\nmuch stress on Natural Selection, and I still think justly. I came to\r\nthink from geographical distribution, etc., etc., that species probably\r\nchange; but for years I was stopped dead by my utter incapability of\r\nseeing how every part of each creature (a woodpecker or swallow, for\r\ninstance) had become adapted to its conditions of life. This seemed\r\nto me, and does still seem, the problem to solve; and I think Natural\r\nSelection solves it, as artificial selection solves the adaptation of\r\ndomestic races for man's use. But I suspect that you mean something\r\nfurther,--that there is some unknown law of evolution by which species\r\nnecessarily change; and if this be so, I cannot agree. This, however,\r\nis too large a question even for so unreasonably long a letter as\r\nthis. Nevertheless, just to explain by mere valueless conjectures how I\r\nimagine the teeth of your elephants change, I should look at the change\r\nas indirectly resulting from changes in the form of the jaws, or from\r\nthe development of tusks, or in the case of the primigenius even from\r\ncorrelation with the woolly covering; in all cases Natural Selection\r\nchecking the variation. If, indeed, an elephant would succeed better by\r\nfeeding on some new kinds of food, then any variation of any kind in the\r\nteeth which favoured their grinding power would be preserved. Now, I can\r\nfancy you holding up your hands and crying out what bosh! To return\r\nto your concluding sentence: far from being surprised, I look at it\r\nas absolutely certain that very much in the \"Origin\" will be proved\r\nrubbish; but I expect and hope that the framework will stand. (143/4.\r\nFalconer, page 80: \"He [Darwin] has laid the foundations of a great\r\nedifice: but he need not be surprised if, in the progress of erection,\r\nthe superstructure is altered by his successors...\")\r\n\r\nI had hoped to have called on you on Monday evening, but was quite\r\nknocked up. I saw Lyell yesterday morning. He was very curious about\r\nyour views, and as I had to write to him this morning I could not help\r\ntelling him a few words on your views. I suppose you are tired of the\r\n\"Origin,\" and will never read it again; otherwise I should like you to\r\nhave the third edition, and would gladly send it rather than you should\r\nlook at the first or second edition. With cordial thanks for your\r\ngenerous kindness.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 144. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. Royal Gardens, Kew, November\r\n7th, 1862.\r\n\r\nI am greatly relieved by your letter this morning about my Arctic essay,\r\nfor I had been conjuring up some egregious blunder (like the granitic\r\nplains of Patagonia).. Certes, after what you have told me of Dawson,\r\nhe will not like the letter I wrote to him days ago, in which I told\r\nhim that it was impossible to entertain a strong opinion against the\r\nDarwinian hypothesis without its giving rise to a mental twist when\r\nviewing matters in which that hypothesis was or might be involved. I\r\ntold him I felt that this was so with me when I opposed you, and that\r\nall minds are subject to such obliquities!--the Lord help me, and this\r\nto an LL.D. and Principal of a College! I proceeded to discuss his\r\nGeology with the effrontery of a novice; and, thank God, I urged the\r\nvery argument of your letter about evidence of subsidence--viz., not all\r\nsubmerged at once, and glacial action being subaerial and not oceanic.\r\nYour letter hence was a relief, for I felt I was hardly strong enough to\r\nhave launched out as I did to a professed geologist.\r\n\r\n(144/1. [On the subject of the above letter, see one of earlier date by\r\nSir J.D. Hooker (November 2nd, 1862) given in the present work (Letter\r\n354) with Darwin's reply (Letter 355).])\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 145. TO HUGH FALCONER. Down, November 14th [1862].\r\n\r\nI have read your paper (145/1. \"On the disputed Affinity of the\r\nMammalian Genus Plagiaulax, from the Purbeck beds.\"--\"Quart. Journ.\r\nGeol. Soc.\" Volume XVIII., page 348, 1862.) with extreme interest, and I\r\nthank you for sending it, though I should certainly have carefully\r\nread it, or anything with your name, in the Journal. It seems to me a\r\nmasterpiece of close reasoning: although, of course, not a judge of\r\nsuch subjects, I cannot feel any doubt that it is conclusive. Will Owen\r\nanswer you? I expect that from his arrogant view of his own position he\r\nwill not answer. Your paper is dreadfully severe on him, but perfectly\r\ncourteous, and polished as the finest dagger. How kind you are towards\r\nme: your first sentence (145/2. \"One of the most accurate observers and\r\noriginal thinkers of our time has discoursed with emphatic eloquence on\r\nthe Imperfection of the Geological Record.\") has pleased me more than\r\nperhaps it ought to do, if I had any modesty in my composition. By the\r\nway, after reading the first whole paragraph, I re-read it, not for\r\nmatter, but for style; and then it suddenly occurred to me that a\r\ncertain man once said to me, when I urged him to publish some of his\r\nmiscellaneous wealth of knowledge, \"Oh, he could not write,--he hated\r\nit,\" etc. You false man, never say that to me again. Your incidental\r\nremark on the remarkable specialisation of Plagiaulax (145/3. \"If\r\nPlagiaulax be regarded through the medium of the view advocated with\r\nsuch power by Darwin, through what a number of intermediate forms must\r\nnot the genus have passed before it attained the specialised condition\r\nin which the fossils come before us!\") (which has stuck in my gizzard\r\never since I read your first paper) as bearing on the number of\r\npreceding forms, is quite new to me, and, of course, is in accordance to\r\nmy notions a most impressive argument. I was also glad to be reminded of\r\nteeth of camel and tarsal bones. (145/4. Op. cit. page 353. A reference\r\nto Cuvier's instance \"of the secret relation between the upper\r\ncanine-shaped incisors of the camel and the bones of the tarsus.\")\r\nDescent from an intermediate form, Ahem!\r\n\r\nWell, all I can say is that I have not been for a long time more\r\ninterested with a paper than with yours. It gives me a demoniacal\r\nchuckle to think of Owen's pleasant countenance when he reads it.\r\n\r\nI have not been in London since the end of September; when I do come I\r\nwill beat up your quarters if I possibly can; but I do not know what\r\nhas come over me. I am worse than ever in bearing any excitement. Even\r\ntalking of an evening for less than two hours has twice recently brought\r\non such violent vomiting and trembling that I dread coming up to London.\r\nI hear that you came out strong at Cambridge (145/5. Prof. Owen, in a\r\ncommunication to the British Association at Cambridge (1862) \"On a tooth\r\nof Mastodon from the Tertiary marls, near Shanghai,\" brought forward\r\nthe case of the Australian Mastodon as a proof of the remarkable\r\ngeographical distribution of the Proboscidia. In a subsequent discussion\r\nhe frankly abandoned it, in consequence of the doubts then urged\r\nregarding its authenticity. (See footnote, page 101, in Falconer's paper\r\n\"On the American Fossil Elephant,\" \"Nat. Hist. Review,\" 1863.)), and am\r\nheartily glad you attacked the Australian Mastodon. I never did or could\r\nbelieve in him. I wish you would read my little Primula paper in the\r\n\"Linnean Journal,\" Volume VI. Botany (No. 22), page 77 (I have no copy\r\nwhich I can spare), as I think there is a good chance that you may have\r\nobserved similar cases. This is my real hobby-horse at present. I have\r\nre-tested this summer the functional difference of the two forms in\r\nPrimula, and find all strictly accurate. If you should know of any cases\r\nanalogous, pray inform me. Farewell, my good and kind friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 146. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(146/1. The following letter is interesting in connection with a letter\r\naddressed to Sir J.D. Hooker, March 26th, 1862, No. 136, where the\r\nvalue of Natural Selection is stated more strongly by Sir Joseph than by\r\nDarwin. It is unfortunate that Sir Joseph's letter, to which this is a\r\nreply, has not been found.)\r\n\r\nDown, November 20th [1862].\r\n\r\nYour last letter has interested me to an extraordinary degree, and your\r\ntruly parsonic advice, \"some other wise and discreet person,\" etc.,\r\netc., amused us not a little. I will put a concrete case to show what\r\nI think A. Gray believes about crossing and what I believe. If 1,000\r\npigeons were bred together in a cage for 10,000 years their number\r\nnot being allowed to increase by chance killing, then from mutual\r\nintercrossing no varieties would arise; but, if each pigeon were a\r\nself-fertilising hermaphrodite, a multitude of varieties would\r\narise. This, I believe, is the common effect of crossing, viz., the\r\nobliteration of incipient varieties. I do not deny that when two marked\r\nvarieties have been produced, their crossing will produce a third\r\nor more intermediate varieties. Possibly, or probably, with domestic\r\nvarieties, with a strong tendency to vary, the act of crossing tends\r\nto give rise to new characters; and thus a third or more races, not\r\nstrictly intermediate, may be produced. But there is heavy evidence\r\nagainst new characters arising from crossing wild forms; only\r\nintermediate races are then produced. Now, do you agree thus far? if\r\nnot, it is no use arguing; we must come to swearing, and I am convinced\r\nI can swear harder than you, therefore I am right. Q.E.D.\r\n\r\nIf the number of 1,000 pigeons were prevented increasing not by chance\r\nkilling, but by, say, all the shorter-beaked birds being killed, then\r\nthe WHOLE body would come to have longer beaks. Do you agree?\r\n\r\nThirdly, if 1,000 pigeons were kept in a hot country, and another\r\n1,000 in a cold country, and fed on different food, and confined in\r\ndifferent-size aviary, and kept constant in number by chance killing,\r\nthen I should expect as rather probable that after 10,000 years the two\r\nbodies would differ slightly in size, colour, and perhaps other trifling\r\ncharacters; this I should call the direct action of physical conditions.\r\nBy this action I wish to imply that the innate vital forces are somehow\r\nled to act rather differently in the two cases, just as heat will\r\nallow or cause two elements to combine, which otherwise would not have\r\ncombined. I should be especially obliged if you would tell me what you\r\nthink on this head.\r\n\r\nBut the part of your letter which fairly pitched me head over heels with\r\nastonishment, is that where you state that every single difference which\r\nwe see might have occurred without any selection. I do and have always\r\nfully agreed; but you have got right round the subject, and viewed it\r\nfrom an entirely opposite and new side, and when you took me there I was\r\nastounded. When I say I agree, I must make the proviso, that under\r\nyour view, as now, each form long remains adapted to certain fixed\r\nconditions, and that the conditions of life are in the long run\r\nchangeable; and second, which is more important, that each individual\r\nform is a self-fertilising hermaphrodite, so that each hair-breadth\r\nvariation is not lost by intercrossing. Your manner of putting the case\r\nwould be even more striking than it is if the mind could grapple with\r\nsuch numbers--it is grappling with eternity--think of each of a thousand\r\nseeds bringing forth its plant, and then each a thousand. A globe\r\nstretching to the furthest fixed star would very soon be covered. I\r\ncannot even grapple with the idea, even with races of dogs, cattle,\r\npigeons, or fowls; and here all admit and see the accurate strictness of\r\nyour illustration.\r\n\r\nSuch men as you and Lyell thinking that I make too much of a Deus of\r\nNatural Selection is a conclusive argument against me. Yet I hardly know\r\nhow I could have put in, in all parts of my book, stronger sentences.\r\nThe title, as you once pointed out, might have been better. No one ever\r\nobjects to agriculturalists using the strongest language about their\r\nselection, yet every breeder knows that he does not produce the\r\nmodification which he selects. My enormous difficulty for years was to\r\nunderstand adaptation, and this made me, I cannot but think, rightly,\r\ninsist so much on Natural Selection. God forgive me for writing at such\r\nlength; but you cannot tell how much your letter has interested me, and\r\nhow important it is for me with my present book in hand to try and get\r\nclear ideas. Do think a bit about what is meant by direct action of\r\nphysical conditions. I do not mean whether they act; my facts will throw\r\nsome light on this. I am collecting all cases of bud-variations, in\r\ncontradistinction to seed-variations (do you like this term, for what\r\nsome gardeners call \"sports\"?); these eliminate all effects of crossing.\r\nPray remember how much I value your opinion as the clearest and most\r\noriginal I ever get.\r\n\r\nI see plainly that Welwitschia (146/2. Sir Joseph's great paper on\r\nWelwitschia mirabilis was published in the \"Linn. Soc. Trans.\" 1863.)\r\nwill be a case of Barnacles.\r\n\r\nI have another plant to beg, but I write on separate paper as more\r\nconvenient for you to keep. I meant to have said before, as an excuse\r\nfor asking for so much from Kew, that I have now lost TWO seasons, by\r\naccursed nurserymen not having right plants, and sending me the wrong\r\ninstead of saying that they did not possess.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 147. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, 24th [November, 1862].\r\n\r\nI have just received enclosed for you, and I have thought that you\r\nwould like to read the latter half of A. Gray's letter to me, as it is\r\npolitical and nearly as mad as ever in our English eyes. You will see\r\nhow the loss of the power of bullying is in fact the sore loss to the\r\nmen of the North from disunion.\r\n\r\nI return with thanks Bates' letter, which I was glad to see. It was\r\nvery good of you writing to him, for he is evidently a man who wants\r\nencouragement. I have now finished his paper (but have read nothing\r\nelse in the volume); it seems to me admirable. To my mind the act of\r\nsegregation of varieties into species was never so plainly brought\r\nforward, and there are heaps of capital miscellaneous observations.\r\n\r\nI hardly know why I am a little sorry, but my present work is leading\r\nme to believe rather more in the direct action of physical conditions. I\r\npresume I regret it, because it lessens the glory of Natural Selection,\r\nand is so confoundedly doubtful. Perhaps I shall change again when I get\r\nall my facts under one point of view, and a pretty hard job this will\r\nbe. (147/1. This paragraph was published in \"Life and Letters,\" II.,\r\npage 390. It is not clear why a belief in \"direct action\" should\r\ndiminish the glory of Natural Selection, since the changes so produced\r\nmust, like any other variations, pass through the ordeal of the survival\r\nof the fittest. On the whole question of direct action see Mr. Adam\r\nSedgwick's \"Presidential Address to the Zoological Section of the\r\nBritish Association,\" 1899.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 148. TO H.W. BATES. Down, November 25th [1862?].\r\n\r\nI should think it was not necessary to get a written agreement. (148/1.\r\nMr. Bates' book, \"A Naturalist on the Amazons,\" was published in 1863.)\r\nI have never had one from Murray. I suppose you have a letter with\r\nterms; if not, I should think you had better ask for one to prevent\r\nmisunderstandings. I think Sir C. Lyell told me he had not any formal\r\nagreements. I am heartily glad to hear that your book is progressing.\r\nCould you find me some place, even a footnote (though these are in nine\r\ncases out of ten objectionable), where you could state, as fully as your\r\nmaterials permit, all the facts about similar varieties pairing,--at a\r\nguess how many you caught, and how many now in your collection? I look\r\nat this fact as very important; if not in your book, put it somewhere\r\nelse, or let me have cases.\r\n\r\nI entirely agree with you on the enormous advantage of thoroughly\r\nstudying one group.\r\n\r\nI really have no criticism to make. (148/2. Mr. Bates' paper on mimetic\r\nbutterflies was read before the Linnean Society, November 21st, 1861,\r\nand published in the \"Linn. Soc. Trans.\" XXIII., 1862, page 495, under\r\nthe title of \"Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley.\")\r\nStyle seems to me very good and clear; but I much regret that in the\r\ntitle or opening passage you did not blow a loud trumpet about what\r\nyou were going to show. Perhaps the paper would have been better more\r\ndivided into sections with headings. Perhaps you might have given\r\nsomewhere rather more of a summary on the progress of segregation\r\nof varieties, and not referred your readers to the descriptive part,\r\nexcepting such readers as wanted minute detail. But these are trifles:\r\nI consider your paper as a most admirable production in every way.\r\nWhenever I come to variation under natural conditions (my head for\r\nmonths has been exclusively occupied with domestic varieties), I shall\r\nhave to study and re-study your paper, and no doubt shall then have to\r\nplague you with questions. I am heartily glad to hear that you are well.\r\nI have been compelled to write in a hurry; so excuse me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 149. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, December 7th [1862].\r\n\r\nI was on the point of adding to an order to Williams & Norgate for your\r\nLectures (149/1. \"A Course of Six Lectures to Working Men,\" published in\r\nsix pamphlets by Hardwicke, and later as a book. See Letter 156.) when\r\nthey arrived, and much obliged I am. I have read them with interest, and\r\nthey seem to me very good for this purpose and capitally written, as is\r\neverything which you write. I suppose every book nowadays requires some\r\npushing, so that if you do not wish these lectures to be extensively\r\ncirculated, I suppose they will not; otherwise I should think they would\r\ndo good and spread a taste for the natural sciences. Anyhow, I have\r\nliked them; but I get more and more, I am sorry to say, to care for\r\nnothing but Natural History; and chiefly, as you once said, for the mere\r\nspecies question. I think I liked No. III. the best of all. I have often\r\nsaid and thought that the process of scientific discovery was identical\r\nwith everyday thought, only with more care; but I never succeeded in\r\nputting the case to myself with one-tenth of the clearness with which\r\nyou have done. I think your second geological section will puzzle your\r\nnon-scientific readers; anyhow, it has puzzled me, and with the strong\r\nmiddle line, which must represent either a line of stratification or\r\nsome great mineralogical change, I cannot conceive how your statement\r\ncan hold good.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear of your \"three-year-old\" vigour [?]; but I fear,\r\nwith all your multifarious work, that your book on Man will necessarily\r\nbe delayed. You bad man; you say not a word about Mrs. Huxley, of whom\r\nmy wife and self are always truly anxious to hear.\r\n\r\nP.S. I see in the \"Cornhill Magazine\" a notice of a work by Cohn, which\r\napparently is important, on the contractile tissue of plants. (149/2.\r\n\"Ueber contractile Gewebe im Pflanzenreiche.\" \"Abhand. der Schlesischen\r\nGesellschaft fur vaterlandische Cultur,\" Heft I., 1861.) You ought to\r\nhave it reviewed. I have ordered it, and must try and make out, if\r\nI can, some of the accursed german, for I am much interested in the\r\nsubject, and experimented a little on it this summer, and came to\r\nthe conclusion that plants must contain some substance most closely\r\nanalogous to the supposed diffused nervous matter in the lower animals;\r\nor as, I presume, it would be more accurate to say with Cohn, that they\r\nhave contractile tissue.\r\n\r\nLecture VI., page 151, line 7 from top--wetting FEET or bodies? (Miss\r\nHenrietta Darwin's criticism.) (149/3. Lecture VI., page 151: Lamarck\r\n\"said, for example, that the short-legged birds, which live on fish, had\r\nbeen converted into the long-legged waders by desiring to get the fish\r\nwithout wetting their feet.\"\r\n\r\nTheir criticisms on Lectures IV. and VI. are on a separate piece of\r\nundated paper, and must belong to a letter of later date; only three\r\nlectures were published by December 7th, 1862.)\r\n\r\nLecture IV., page 89--Atavism.\r\n\r\nYou here and there use atavism = inheritance. Duchesne, who, I believe,\r\ninvented the word, in his Strawberry book confined it, as every one has\r\nsince done, to resemblance to grandfather or more remote ancestor, in\r\ncontradistinction to resemblance to parents.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 150. TO JOHN SCOTT.\r\n\r\n(150/1. The following is the first of a series of letters addressed to\r\nthe late John Scott, of which the major part is given in our Botanical\r\nchapters. We have been tempted to give this correspondence fully not\r\nonly because of its intrinsic scientific interest, but also because they\r\nare almost the only letters which show Darwin in personal relation with\r\na younger man engaged in research under his supervision.)\r\n\r\n[1862?]\r\n\r\nTo the best of my judgment, no subject is so important in relation to\r\ntheoretical natural science, in several respects, and likewise in\r\nitself deserving investigation, as the effects of changed or unnatural\r\nconditions, or of changed structure on the reproductive system. Under\r\nthis point of view the relation of well-marked but undoubted varieties\r\nin fertilising each other requires far more experiments than have been\r\ntried. See in the \"Origin\" the brief abstract of Gartner on Verbascum\r\nand Zea. Mr. W. Crocker, lately foreman at Kew and a very good observer,\r\nis going at my suggestion to work varieties of hollyhock. (150/2.\r\nAltheae species. These experiments seem not to have been carried out.)\r\nThe climate would be too cold, I suppose, for varieties of tobacco. I\r\nbegan on cabbages, but immediately stopped from early shedding of their\r\npollen causing too much trouble. Your knowledge would suggest some\r\n[plants]. On the same principle it would be well to test peloric flowers\r\nwith their own pollen, and with pollen of regular flowers, and try\r\npollen of peloric on regular flowers--seeds being counted in each case.\r\nI have now got one seedling from many crosses of a peloric Pelargonium\r\nby peloric pollen; I have two or three seedlings from a peloric flower\r\nby pollen of regular flower. I have ordered a peloric Antirrhinum\r\n(150/3. See \"Variation of Animals and Plants,\" Edition I., Volume II.,\r\npage 70.) and the peloric Gloxinia, but I much fear I shall never have\r\ntime to try them. The Passiflora cases are truly wonderful, like the\r\nCrinum cases (see \"Origin\"). (150/4. \"Origin,\" Edition VI., page 238.)\r\nI have read in a German paper that some varieties of potatoes (name not\r\ngiven) cannot be fertilised by [their] own pollen, but can by pollen\r\nof other varieties: well worth trying. Again, fertility of any monster\r\nflower, which is pretty regularly produced; I have got the wonderful\r\nBegonia frigida (150/5. The species on which Sir J.D. Hooker wrote in\r\nthe \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" February 25th, 1860. See \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nII., page 275.) from Kew, but doubt whether I have heat to set its\r\nseeds. If an unmodified Celosia could be got, it would be well to\r\ntest with the modified cockscomb. There is a variation of columbine\r\n[Aquilegia] with simple petals without nectaries, etc., etc. I never\r\ncould think what to try; but if one could get hold of a long-cultivated\r\nplant which crossed with a distinct species and yielded a very small\r\nnumber of seeds, then it would be highly good to test comparatively the\r\nwild parent-form and its varying offspring with this third species: for\r\ninstance, if a polyanthus would cross with some species of Primula, then\r\nto try a wild cowslip with it. I believe hardly any primulas have ever\r\nbeen crossed. If we knew and could get the parent of the carnation\r\n(150/6. Dianthus caryophyllus, garden variety.), it would be very good\r\nfor this end. Any member of the Lythraceae raised from seed ought to be\r\nwell looked after for dimorphism. I have wonderful facts, the result of\r\nexperiment, on Lythrum salicaria.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 151. TO JOHN SCOTT. Down, December 11th [1862].\r\n\r\nI have read your paper with much interest. (151/1. \"On the Nature and\r\nPeculiarities of the Fern-spore.\" \"Bot. Soc. Edin.\" Read June 12th,\r\n1862.) You ask for remarks on the matter, which is alone really\r\nimportant. Shall you think me impertinent (I am sure I do not mean to be\r\nso) if I hazard a remark on the style, which is of more importance than\r\nsome think? In my opinion (whether or no worth much) your paper would\r\nhave been much better if written more simply and less elaborated--more\r\nlike your letters. It is a golden rule always to use, if possible, a\r\nshort old Saxon word. Such a sentence as \"so purely dependent is the\r\nincipient plant on the specific morphological tendency\" does not sound\r\nto my ears like good mother-English--it wants translating. Here and\r\nthere you might, I think, have condensed some sentences. I go on the\r\nplan of thinking every single word which can be omitted without actual\r\nloss of sense as a decided gain. Now perhaps you will think me a\r\nmeddling intruder: anyhow, it is the advice of an old hackneyed\r\nwriter who sincerely wishes you well. Your remark on the two sexes\r\ncounteracting variability in product of the one is new to me. (151/2.\r\nScott (op. cit., page 214): \"The reproductive organs of phoenogams,\r\nas is well-known, are always products of two morphologically distinct\r\norgans, the stamens producing the pollen, the carpels producing the\r\novules...The embryo being in this case the modified resultant of two\r\noriginally distinct organs, there will necessarily be a greater tendency\r\nto efface any individual peculiarities of these than would have been\r\nthe case had the embryo been the product of a single organ.\" A different\r\nidea seems to have occurred to Mr. Darwin, for in an undated letter\r\nto Scott he wrote: \"I hardly know what to say on your view of male and\r\nfemale organs and variability. I must think more over it. But I was\r\namused by finding the other day in my portfolio devoted to bud-variation\r\na slip of paper dated June, 1860, with some such words as these, 'May\r\nnot permanence of grafted buds be due to the two sexual elements\r\nderived from different parts not having come into play?' I had utterly\r\nforgotten, when I read your paper that any analogous notion had ever\r\npassed through my mind--nor can I now remember, but the slip shows me\r\nthat it had.\" It is interesting that Huxley also came to a conclusion\r\ndiffering from Scott's; and, curiously enough, Darwin confused the two\r\nviews, for he wrote to Scott (December 19th): \"By an odd chance, reading\r\nlast night some short lectures just published by Prof. Huxley, I find\r\nyour observation, independently arrived at by him, on the confluence of\r\nthe two sexes causing variability.\" Professor Huxley's remarks are in\r\nhis \"Lectures to Working Men on our Knowledge, etc.\" No. 4, page 90:\r\n\"And, indeed, I think that a certain amount of variation from the\r\nprimitive stock is the necessary result of the method of sexual\r\npropagation itself; for inasmuch as the thing propagated proceeds from\r\ntwo organisms of different sexes and different makes and temperaments,\r\nand, as the offspring is to be either of one sex or the other, it is\r\nquite clear that it cannot be an exact diagonal of the two, or it would\r\nbe of no sex at all; it cannot be an exact intermediate form between\r\nthat of each of its parents--it must deviate to one side or the other.\")\r\nBut I cannot avoid thinking that there is something unknown and deeper\r\nin seminal generation. Reflect on the long succession of embryological\r\nchanges in every animal. Does a bud ever produce cotyledons or embryonic\r\nleaves? I have been much interested by your remark on inheritance at\r\ncorresponding ages; I hope you will, as you say, continue to attend to\r\nthis. Is it true that female Primula plants always produce females\r\nby parthenogenesis? (151/3. It seems probable that Darwin here means\r\nvegetative reproduction.) If you can answer this I should be glad;\r\nit bears on my Primula work. I thought on the subject, but gave\r\nup investigating what had been observed, because the female bee by\r\nparthenogenesis produces males alone. Your paper has told me much that\r\nin my ignorance was quite new to me. Thanks about P. scotica. If any\r\nimportant criticisms are made on the Primula to the Botanical Society,\r\nI should be glad to hear them. If you think fit, you may state that I\r\nrepeated the crossing experiments on P. sinensis and cowslip with the\r\nsame result this spring as last year--indeed, with rather more marked\r\ndifference in fertility of the two crosses. In fact, had I then proved\r\nthe Linum case, I would not have wasted time in repetition. I am\r\ndetermined I will at once publish on Linum...\r\n\r\nI was right to be cautious in supposing you in error about Siphocampylus\r\n(no flowers were enclosed). I hope that you will make out whether the\r\npistil presents two definite lengths; I shall be astounded if it does. I\r\ndo not fully understand your objections to Natural Selection; if I do,\r\nI presume they would apply with full force to, for instance, birds.\r\nReflect on modification of Arab-Turk horse into our English racehorse. I\r\nhave had the satisfaction to tell my publisher to send my \"Journal\" and\r\n\"Origin\" to your address. I suspect, with your fertile mind, you\r\nwill find it far better to experiment on your own choice; but if, on\r\nreflection, you would like to try some which interest me, I should be\r\ntruly delighted, and in this case would write in some detail. If\r\nyou have the means to repeat Gartner's experiments on variations of\r\nVerbascum or on maize (see the \"Origin\"), such experiments would be\r\npre-eminently important. I could never get variations of Verbascum.\r\nI could suggest an experiment on potatoes analogous with the case of\r\nPassiflora; even the case of Passiflora, often as it has been repeated,\r\nmight be with advantage repeated. I have worked like a slave (having\r\ncounted about nine thousand seeds) on Melastoma, on the meaning of the\r\ntwo sets of very different stamens, and as yet have been shamefully\r\nbeaten, and I now cry for aid. I could suggest what I believe a\r\nvery good scheme (at least, Dr. Hooker thought so) for systematic\r\ndegeneration of culinary plants, and so find out their origin; but this\r\nwould be laborious and the work of years.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 152. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, 12th [December, 1862].\r\n\r\nMy good old Friend--\r\n\r\nHow kind you have been to give me so much of your time! Your letter\r\nis of real use, and has been and shall be well considered. I am much\r\npleased to find that we do not differ as much as I feared. I begin my\r\nbook with saying that my chief object is to show the inordinate scale\r\nof variation; I have especially studied all sorts of variations of the\r\nindividual. On crossing I cannot change; the more I think, the more\r\nreason I have to believe that my conclusion would be agreed to by\r\nall practised breeders. I also greatly doubt about variability and\r\ndomestication being at all necessarily correlative, but I have touched\r\non this in \"Origin.\" Plants being identical under very different\r\nconditions has always seemed to me a very heavy argument against what\r\nI call direct action. I think perhaps I will take the case of 1,000\r\npigeons (152/1. See Letter 146.) to sum up my volume; I will not discuss\r\nother points, but, as I have said, I shall recur to your letter. But\r\nI must just say that if sterility be allowed to come into play, if\r\nlong-beaked be in the least degree sterile with short-beaked, my whole\r\ncase is altered. By the way, my notions on hybridity are becoming\r\nconsiderably altered by my dimorphic work. I am now strongly inclined to\r\nbelieve that sterility is at first a selected quality to keep incipient\r\nspecies distinct. If you have looked at Lythrum you will see how pollen\r\ncan be modified merely to favour crossing; with equal readiness it could\r\nbe modified to prevent crossing.\r\n\r\nIt is this which makes me so much interested with dimorphism, etc.\r\n(152/2. This gives a narrow impression of Darwin's interest in\r\ndimorphism. The importance of his work was (briefly put) the proof that\r\nsterility has no necessary connection with specific difference, but\r\ndepends on sexual differentiation independent of racial differences. See\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" III., page 296. His point of view that sterility\r\nis a selected quality is again given in a letter to Huxley (\"Life and\r\nLetters,\" II., page 384), but was not upheld in his later writings (see\r\n\"Origin of Species,\" Edition VI., page 245). The idea of sterility being\r\na selected quality is interesting in connection with Romanes' theory of\r\nphysiological selection. (See Letters 209-214.))\r\n\r\nOne word more. When you pitched me head over heels by your new way of\r\nlooking at the back side of variation, I received assurance and strength\r\nby considering monsters--due to law: horribly strange as they are, the\r\nmonsters were alive till at least when born. They differ at least as\r\nmuch from the parent as any one mammal from another.\r\n\r\nI have just finished a long, weary chapter on simple facts of variation\r\nof cultivated plants, and am now refreshing myself with a paper on Linum\r\nfor the Linnean Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 153. TO W.B. TEGETMEIER.\r\n\r\n(153/1. The following letter also bears on the question of the\r\nartificial production of sterility.)\r\n\r\nDown, 27th [December, 1862].\r\n\r\nThe present plan is to try whether any existing breeds happen to\r\nhave acquired accidentally any degree of sterility; but to this point\r\nhereafter. The enclosed MS. will show what I have done and know on the\r\nsubject. Please at some future time carefully return the MS. to me. If I\r\nwere going to try again, I would prefer Turbit with Carrier or Dragon.\r\n\r\nI will suggest an analogous experiment, which I have had for two years\r\nin my experimental book with \"be sure and try,\" but which, as my health\r\ngets yearly weaker and weaker and my other work increases, I suppose\r\nI shall never try. Permit me to add that if 5 pounds would cover the\r\nexpenses of the experiment, I should be delighted to give it, and you\r\ncould publish the result if there be any result. I crossed the Spanish\r\ncock (your bird) and white Silk hen and got plenty of eggs and chickens;\r\nbut two of them seemed to be quite sterile. I was then sadly overdone\r\nwith work, but have ever since much reproached myself that I did not\r\npreserve and carefully test the procreative power of these hens. Now, if\r\nyou are inclined to get a Spanish cock and a couple of white Silk hens,\r\nI shall be most grateful to hear whether the offspring breed well: they\r\nwill prove, I think, not hardy; if they should prove sterile, which I\r\ncan hardly believe, they will anyhow do for the pot. If you do try this,\r\nhow would it do to put a Silk cock to your curious silky Cochin hen, so\r\nas to get a big silk breed; it would be curious if you could get silky\r\nfowl with bright colours. I believe a Silk hen crossed by any other\r\nbreed never gives silky feathers. A cross from Silk cock and Cochin Silk\r\nhen ought to give silky feathers and probably bright colours.\r\n\r\nI have been led lately from experiments (not published) on dimorphism\r\nto reflect much on sterility from hybridism, and partially to change\r\nthe opinion given in \"Origin.\" I have now letters out enquiring on the\r\nfollowing point, implied in the experiment, which seems to me well worth\r\ntrying, but too laborious ever to be attempted. I would ask every pigeon\r\nand fowl fancier whether they have ever observed, in the same breed, a\r\ncock A paired to a hen B which did not produce young. Then I would get\r\ncock A and match it to a hen of its nearest blood; and hen B to its\r\nnearest blood. I would then match the offspring of A (viz., a, b, c, d,\r\ne) to the offspring of B (viz., f, g, h, i, j), and all those children\r\nwhich were fertile together should be destroyed until I found one--say\r\na, which was not quite fertile with--say, i. Then a and i should be\r\npreserved and paired with their parents A and B, so as to try and get\r\ntwo families which would not unite together; but the members WITHIN each\r\nfamily being fertile together. This would probably be quite hopeless;\r\nbut he who could effect this would, I believe, solve the problem of\r\nsterility from hybridism. If you should ever hear of individual fowls or\r\npigeons which are sterile together, I should be very grateful to hear of\r\nthe case. It is a parallel case to those recorded of a man not impotent\r\nlong living with a woman who remained childless; the husband died, and\r\nthe woman married again and had plenty of children. Apparently (by\r\nno means certainly) this first man and woman were dissimilar in their\r\nsexual organisation. I conceive it possible that their offspring\r\n(if both had married again and both had children) would be sexually\r\ndissimilar, like their parents, or sterile together. Pray forgive my\r\ndreadful writing; I have been very unwell all day, and have no strength\r\nto re-write this scrawl. I am working slowly on, and I suppose in three\r\nor four months shall be ready.\r\n\r\nI am sure I do not know whether any human being could understand or read\r\nthis shameful scrawl.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 154. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, December, 28th [1862].\r\n\r\nI return enclosed: if you write, thank Mr. Kingsley for thinking\r\nof letting me see the sound sense of an Eastern potentate. (154/1.\r\nKingsley's letter to Huxley, dated December 20th, 1862, contains a story\r\nor parable of a heathen Khan in Tartary who was visited by a pair of\r\nproselytising Moollahs. The first Moollah said: \"Oh! Khan, worship my\r\nGod. He is so wise that he made all things.\" But Moollah No. 2 won the\r\nday by pointing out that his God is \"so wise that he makes all things\r\nmake themselves.\") All that I said about the little book (154/2. The six\r\n\"Lectures to Working Men,\" published in six pamphlets and in book-form\r\nin 1863. Mr. Huxley considered that Mr. Darwin's argument required\r\nthe production by man's selection of breeds which should be mutually\r\ninfertile, and thus resemble distinct species physiologically as well as\r\nmorphologically.) is strictly my opinion; it is in every way excellent,\r\nand cannot fail to do good the wider it is circulated. Whether it is\r\nworth your while to give up time to it is another question for you alone\r\nto decide; that it will do good for the subject is beyond all question.\r\nI do not think a dunce exists who could not understand it, and that is\r\na bold saying after the extent to which I have been misunderstood. I did\r\nnot understand what you required about sterility: assuredly the facts\r\ngiven do not go nearly so far. We differ so much that it is no use\r\narguing. To get the degree of sterility you expect in recently formed\r\nvarieties seems to me simply hopeless. It seems to me almost like those\r\nnaturalists who declare they will never believe that one species turns\r\ninto another till they see every stage in process.\r\n\r\nI have heard from Tegetmeier, and have given him the result of my\r\ncrosses of the birds which he proposes to try, and have told him how\r\nalone I think the experiment could be tried with the faintest hope of\r\nsuccess--namely, to get, if possible, a case of two birds which when\r\npaired were unproductive, yet neither impotent. For instance, I had this\r\nmorning a letter with a case of a Hereford heifer, which seemed to be,\r\nafter repeated trials, sterile with one particular and far from impotent\r\nbull, but not with another bull. But it is too long a story--it is to\r\nattempt to make two strains, both fertile, and yet sterile when one\r\nof one strain is crossed with one of the other strain. But the\r\ndifficulty...would be beyond calculation. As far as I see, Tegetmeier's\r\nplan would simply test whether two existing breeds are now in any\r\nslight degree sterile; which has already been largely tested: not that I\r\ndispute the good of re-testing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 155. TO HUGH FALCONER.\r\n\r\n(155/1. The original letter is dated \"December 10th,\" but this must, we\r\nthink, be a slip of the pen for January 10th. It contains a reference to\r\nNo. VI. of the \"Lectures to Working Men\" which, as Mr. Leonard Huxley\r\nis good enough to inform us, was not delivered until December 15th, and\r\ntherefore could not have been seen by Mr. Darwin on December 10th. The\r\nchange of date makes comprehensible the reference to Falconer's paper\r\n\"On the American Fossil Elephant of the Regions bordering the Gulf of\r\nMexico (E. Columbi, Falc.),\" which appeared in the January number of the\r\n\"Natural History Review.\" It is true that he had seen advanced sheets of\r\nFalconer's paper (\"Life and Letters,\" II., page 389), but the reference\r\nhere is to the complete paper.\r\n\r\nIn the present volume we have thought it right to give some expression\r\nto the attitude of Darwin towards Owen. Professor Owen's biographer has\r\nclearly felt the difficulty of making a statement on Owen's attitude\r\ntowards Darwinism, and has (\"Life of Sir Richard Owen,\" Volume II., page\r\n92) been driven to adopt the severe indictment contained in the \"Origin\r\nof Species,\" Edition VI., page xviii. Darwin was by no means alone in\r\nhis distrust of Owen; and to omit altogether a reference to the conduct\r\nwhich led up to the isolation of Owen among his former friends and\r\ncolleagues would be to omit a part of the history of science of the\r\nday. And since we cannot omit to notice Darwin's point of view, it seems\r\nright to give the facts of a typical case illustrating the feeling\r\nwith which he regarded Owen. This is all the more necessary since the\r\nrecently published biography of Sir R. Owen gives no hint, as far as we\r\nare aware, of even a difference of opinion with other scientific men.\r\n\r\nThe account which Falconer gives in the above-mentioned paper in the\r\n\"Nat. Hist. Review\" (January, 1863) would be amusing if the matter were\r\nless serious. In 1857 Falconer described (\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\"\r\nXIII.) a new species of fossil elephant from America, to which he gave\r\nthe name Elephas Columbi, a designation which was recognised and adopted\r\nby Continental writers. In 1858 (Brit. Assoc. Leeds) Owen made use of\r\nthe name \"Elephas texianus,\" Blake\" for the species which Falconer\r\nhad previously named E. Columbi, but without referring to Falconer's\r\ndetermination; he gave no authority, \"thus by the established usage in\r\nzoology producing it as his own.\" In 1861 Owen in his Palaeontology,\r\n2nd edition, 1861, describes the elephant as E. texianus, Blake. To\r\nMr. Blake's name is appended an asterisk which refers to a footnote\r\nto Bollaert's \"Antiquities of S. America,\" 2nd edition. According to\r\nFalconer (page 46) no second edition of Bollaert had appeared at the\r\ntime of writing (August, 1862), and in the first edition (1860) he\r\nwas \"unable to detect the occurrence of the name even, of E. texianus,\r\nanywhere throughout the volume\"; though Bollaert mentions the fact that\r\nhe had deposited, in the British Museum, the tooth of a fossil elephant\r\nfrom Texas.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1861, Blake wrote a paper in the \"Geologist\" in which the\r\nnew elephant no longer bears his own name as authority, but is described\r\nas \"Elephas texianus, Owen, E. Columbi, Falconer.\" Finally, in another\r\npaper the name of Owen is dropped and the elephant is once more his own.\r\nAs Falconer remarks, \"the usage of science does not countenance such\r\naccommodating arrangements, when the result is to prejudice a prior\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be said, no doubt, that the question who first described a given\r\nspecies is a petty one; but this view has a double edge, and\r\napplies most strongly to those who neglect the just claims of their\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\nDown, January 5th [1863].\r\n\r\nI finished your Elephant paper last night, and you must let me express\r\nmy admiration at it. (155/2. \"On the American Fossil Elephant of the\r\nRegions bordering the Gulf of Mexico (E. Columbi, Falc.), etc.\" \"Nat.\r\nHist. Rev.\" 1863, page 81. (Cf. Letter to Lyell. \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nII., page 389; also \"Origin,\" Edition VI., page 306.) See Letter 143.)\r\nAll the points strike me as admirably worked out, and very many\r\nmost interesting. I was particularly struck with your remarks on the\r\ncharacter of the ancient Mammalian Fauna of N. America (155/3. Falconer,\r\npage 62. This passage is marked in Darwin's copy.); it agrees with all I\r\nfancied was the case, namely a temporary irruption of S. American forms\r\ninto N. America, and conversely, I chuckled a little over the specimen\r\nof M. Andium \"hesitating\" between the two groups. (155/4. In speaking of\r\nthe characters of Mastodon Andium, Falconer refers to a former paper\r\nby himself (\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" Volume XIII. 1857, page 313),\r\nin which he called attention \"to the exceptional character of\r\ncertain specimens of M. Andium, as if hesitating between [the groups]\r\nTetralophodon and Trilophodon\" (ibid., page 100).) I have been assured\r\nby Mr. Wallace that abundant Mastodon remains have been found at Timor,\r\nand that is rather close to Australia. I rejoice that you have smashed\r\nthat case. (155/5. In the paper in the \"Nat. Hist. Review\" (loc. cit.)\r\nFalconer writes: \"It seems more probable that some unintentional error\r\nhas got mixed up with the history of this remarkable fossil; and until\r\nfurther confirmatory evidence is adduced, of an unimpeachable character,\r\nfaith cannot be reposed in the reality of the asserted Australian\r\nMastodon\" (page 101).) It is indeed a grand paper. I will say nothing\r\nmore about your allusions to me, except that they have pleased me quite\r\nas much in print as in MS. You must have worked very hard; the labour\r\nmust have been extreme, but I do hope that you will have health and\r\nstrength to go on. You would laugh if you could see how indignant all\r\nOwen's mean conduct about E. Columbi made me. (155/6. See Letter 157.) I\r\ndid not get to sleep till past 3 o'clock. How well you lash him, firmly\r\nand severely, with unruffled temper, as if you were performing a simple\r\nduty. The case is come to such a pass, that I think every man of science\r\nis bound to show his feelings by some overt act, and I shall watch for a\r\nfitting opportunity.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have kept back for a day the enclosed owing to the arrival of\r\nyour most interesting letter. I knew it was a mere chance whether you\r\ncould inform me on the points required; but no one other person has so\r\noften responded to my miscellaneous queries. I believe I have now in my\r\ngreenhouse L. trigynum (155/7. Linum trigynum.), which came up from seed\r\npurchased as L. flavum, from which it is wholly different in foliage. I\r\nhave just sent in a paper on Dimorphism of Linum to the Linnean Society\r\n(155/8. \"On the Existence of the Forms, and on their reciprocal Sexual\r\nRelation, in several species of the genus Linum.--\"Journ. Linn. Soc.\"\r\nVolume VII., page 69, 1864.), and so I do not doubt your memory is right\r\nabout L. trigynum: the functional difference in the two forms of Linum\r\nis really wonderful. I assure you I quite long to see you and a few\r\nothers in London; it is not so much the eczema which has taken the\r\nepidermis a dozen times clean off; but I have been knocked up of late\r\nwith extraordinary facility, and when I shall be able to come up I know\r\nnot. I particularly wish to hear about the wondrous bird: the case has\r\ndelighted me, because no group is so isolated as Birds. I much wish to\r\nhear when we meet which digits are developed; when examining birds two\r\nor three years ago, I distinctly remember writing to Lyell that some\r\nday a fossil bird would be found with the end of wing cloven, i.e.\r\nthe bastard-wing and other part, both well developed. Thanks for Von\r\nMartius, returned by this post, which I was glad to see. Poor old\r\nWagner (Probably Johann Andreas Wagner, author of \"Zur Feststellung des\r\nArtbegriffes, mit besonderer Bezugnahme auf die Ansichten von Nathusius,\r\nDarwin, Is. Geoffroy and Agassiz,\" \"Munchen Sitzungsb.\" (1861),\r\npage 301, and of numerous papers on zoological and palaeozoological\r\nsubjects.) always attacked me in a proper spirit, and sent me two or\r\nthree little brochures, and I thanked him cordially. The Germans seem\r\nmuch stirred up on the subject. I received by the same post almost a\r\nlittle volume on the \"Origin.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot work above a couple of hours daily, and this plays the deuce\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nP.S. 2nd.--I have worked like a slave and been baffled like a slave in\r\ntrying to make out the meaning of two very different sets of stamens in\r\nsome Melastomaceae. (155/9. Several letters on the Melastomaceae occur\r\nin our Botanical section.) I must tell you one fact. I counted 9,000\r\nseeds, one by one, from my artificially fertilised pods. There is\r\nsomething very odd, but I am as yet beaten. Plants from two pollens grow\r\nat different rates! Now, what I want to know is, whether in individuals\r\nof the same species, growing together, you have ever noticed any\r\ndifference in the position of the pistil or in the size and colour of\r\nthe stamens?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 156. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, December 18th [1862].\r\n\r\nI have read Nos. IV, and V. (156/1. \"On our Knowledge of the Causes\r\nof the Phenomena of Organic Nature,\" being six Lectures to Working Men\r\ndelivered at the Museum of Practical Geology by Prof. Huxley, 1863.\r\nThese lectures, which were given once a week from November 10th, 1862,\r\nonwards, were printed from the notes of Mr. J.A. Mays, a shorthand\r\nwriter, who asked permission to publish them on his own account; Mr.\r\nHuxley stating in a prefatory \"Notice\" that he had no leisure to\r\nrevise the lectures.) They are simply perfect. They ought to be largely\r\nadvertised; but it is very good in me to say so, for I threw down No.\r\nIV. with this reflection, \"What is the good of writing a thundering big\r\nbook, when everything is in this green little book, so despicable for\r\nits size?\" In the name of all that is good and bad, I may as well shut\r\nup shop altogether. You put capitally and most simply and clearly the\r\nrelation of animals and plants to each other at page 122.\r\n\r\nBe careful about Fantails: their tail-feathers are fixed in a radiating\r\nposition, but they can depress and elevate them. I remember in a\r\npigeon-book seeing withering contempt expressed at some naturalist for\r\nnot knowing this important point! Page 111 (156/2. The reference is\r\nto the original little green paper books in which the lectures first\r\nappeared; the paging in the bound volume dated 1863 is slightly\r\ndifferent. The passage here is, \"...If you couple a male and female\r\nhybrid...the result is that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred you\r\nwill get no offspring at all.\" Darwin maintains elsewhere that Huxley,\r\nfrom not knowing the botanical evidence, made too much of this point.\r\nSee \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 384.) seems a little too strong--viz.,\r\nninety-nine out of a hundred, unless you except plants.\r\n\r\nPage 118: You say the answer to varieties when crossed being at all\r\nsterile is \"absolutely a negative.\" (156/3. Huxley, page 112: \"Can we\r\nfind any approximation to this [sterility of hybrids] in the different\r\nraces known to be produced by selective breeding from a common stock? Up\r\nto the present time the answer to that question is absolutely a negative\r\none.\") Do you mean to say that Gartner lied, after experiments by the\r\nhundred (and he a hostile witness), when he showed that this was the\r\ncase with Verbascum and with maize (and here you have selected races):\r\ndoes Kolreuter lie when he speaks about the varieties of tobacco? My\r\nGod, is not the case difficult enough, without its being, as I must\r\nthink, falsely made more difficult? I believe it is my own fault--my\r\nd--d candour: I ought to have made ten times more fuss about these most\r\ncareful experiments. I did put it stronger in the third edition of the\r\n\"Origin.\" If you have a new edition, do consider your second geological\r\nsection: I do not dispute the truth of your statement; but I maintain\r\nthat in almost every case the gravel would graduate into the mud; that\r\nthere would not be a hard, straight line between the mass of gravel and\r\nmud; that the gravel, in crawling inland, would be separated from the\r\nunderlying beds by oblique lines of stratification. A nice idea of the\r\ndifficulty of Geology your section would give to a working man! Do show\r\nyour section to Ramsay, and tell him what I say; and if he thinks it\r\na fair section for a beginner I am shut up, and \"will for ever hold my\r\ntongue.\" Good-night.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 157. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, [January] 10th [1863].\r\n\r\nYou will be weary of notes from me about the little book of yours. It is\r\nlucky for me that I expressed, before reading No. VI. (157/1. \"Lectures\r\nto Working Men,\" No. VI., is a critical examination of the position\r\nof the \"Origin of Species\" in relation to the complete theory of\r\nthe \"causes of the phenomena of organic nature.\"), my opinion of its\r\nabsolute excellence, and of its being well worth wide distribution\r\nand worth correction (not that I see where you could improve), if you\r\nthought it worth your valuable time. Had I read No. VI., even a rudiment\r\nof modesty would, or ought to, have stopped me saying so much. Though I\r\nhave been well abused, yet I have had so much praise, that I have become\r\na gourmand, both as to capacity and taste; and I really did not think\r\nthat mortal man could have tickled my palate in the exquisite manner\r\nwith which you have done the job. So I am an old ass, and nothing more\r\nneed be said about this. I agree entirely with all your reservations\r\nabout accepting the doctrine, and you might have gone further with\r\nfurther safety and truth. Of course I do not wholly agree about\r\nsterility. I hate beyond all things finding myself in disagreement with\r\nany capable judge, when the premises are the same; and yet this will\r\noccasionally happen. Thinking over my former letter to you, I fancied\r\n(but I now doubt) that I had partly found out the cause of our\r\ndisagreement, and I attributed it to your naturally thinking most\r\nabout animals, with which the sterility of the hybrids is much more\r\nconspicuous than the lessened fertility of the first cross. Indeed,\r\nthis could hardly be ascertained with mammals, except by comparing the\r\nproducts of [their] whole life; and, as far as I know, this has only\r\nbeen ascertained in the case of the horse and ass, which do produce\r\nfewer offspring in [their] lifetime than in pure breeding. In plants the\r\ntest of first cross seems as fair as test of sterility of hybrids. And\r\nthis latter test applies, I will maintain to the death, to the crossing\r\nof varieties of Verbascum, and varieties, selected varieties, of Zea.\r\n(157/2. See Letter 156.) You will say Go to the Devil and hold your\r\ntongue. No, I will not hold my tongue; for I must add that after going,\r\nfor my present book, all through domestic animals, I have come to the\r\nconclusion that there are almost certainly several cases of two or three\r\nor more species blended together and now perfectly fertile together.\r\nHence I conclude that there must be something in domestication,--perhaps\r\nthe less stable conditions, the very cause which induces so much\r\nvariability,--which eliminates the natural sterility of species when\r\ncrossed. If so, we can see how unlikely that sterility should arise\r\nbetween domestic races. Now I will hold my tongue. Page 143: ought\r\nnot \"Sanscrit\" to be \"Aryan\"? What a capital number the last \"Natural\r\nHistory Review\" is! That is a grand paper by Falconer. I cannot say how\r\nindignant Owen's conduct about E. Columbi has made me. I believe I hate\r\nhim more than you do, even perhaps more than good old Falconer does. But\r\nI have bubbled over to one or two correspondents on this head, and will\r\nsay no more. I have sent Lubbock a little review of Bates' paper in\r\n\"Linn. Transact.\" (157/3. The unsigned review of Mr. Bates' work on\r\nmimetic butterflies appeared in the \"Nat. Hist. Review\" (1863), page\r\n219.) which L. seems to think will do for your \"Review.\" Do inaugurate a\r\ngreat improvement, and have pages cut, like the Yankees do; I will heap\r\nblessings on your head. Do not waste your time in answering this.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 158. TO JOHN LUBBOCK [LORD AVEBURY]. Down, January 23rd [1863].\r\n\r\nI have no criticism, except one sentence not perfectly smooth. I think\r\nyour introductory remarks very striking, interesting, and novel. (158/1.\r\n\"On the Development of Chloeon (Ephemera) dimidiatum, Part I. By John\r\nLubbock. \"Trans. Linn. Soc.\" Volume XXIV., pages 61-78, 1864 [Read\r\nJanuary 15th, 1863].) They interested me the more, because the vaguest\r\nthoughts of the same kind had passed through my head; but I had no idea\r\nthat they could be so well developed, nor did I know of exceptions.\r\nSitaris and Meloe (158/2. Sitaris and Meloe, two genera of coleopterous\r\ninsects, are referred to by Lubbock (op. cit., pages 63-64) as\r\n\"perhaps...the most remarkable cases...among the Coleoptera\" of curious\r\nand complicated metamorphoses.) seem very good. You have put the whole\r\ncase of metamorphosis in a new light; I dare say what you remark about\r\npoverty of fresh-water is very true. (158/3. \"We cannot but be struck\r\nby the poverty of the fresh-water fauna when compared with that of\r\nthe ocean\" (op. cit., page 64).) I think you might write a memoir\r\non fresh-water productions. I suggest that the key-note is that\r\nland-productions are higher and have advantage in general over marine;\r\nand consequently land-productions have generally been modified into\r\nfresh-water productions, instead of marine productions being directly\r\nchanged into fresh-water productions, as at first seems more probable,\r\nas the chance of immigration is always open from sea to rivers and\r\nponds.\r\n\r\nMy talk with you did me a deal of good, and I enjoyed it much.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 159. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 13th [1863].\r\n\r\nI send a very imperfect answer to [your] question, which I have written\r\non foreign paper to save you copying, and you can send when you write\r\nto Thomson in Calcutta. Hereafter I shall be able to answer better your\r\nquestion about qualities induced in individuals being inherited; gout\r\nin man--loss of wool in sheep (which begins in the first generation and\r\ntakes two or three to complete); probably obesity (for it is rare with\r\npoor); probably obesity and early maturity in short-horn cattle, etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 160. TO A. DE CANDOLLE. Down, January 14th [1863].\r\n\r\nI thank you most sincerely for sending me your Memoir. (160/1. Etude\r\nsur l'Espece a l'occasion d'une revision de la Famille des Cupuliferes.\r\n\"Biblioth. Univ. (Arch. des Sc. Phys. et Nat.),\" Novembre 1862.) I have\r\nread it with the liveliest interest, as is natural for me; but you have\r\nthe art of making subjects, which might be dry, run easily. I have been\r\nfairly astonished at the amount of individual variability in the oaks.\r\nI never saw before the subject in any department of nature worked out so\r\ncarefully. What labour it must have cost you! You spoke in one letter\r\nof advancing years; but I am very sure that no one would have suspected\r\nthat you felt this. I have been interested with every part; though I am\r\nso unfortunate as to differ from most of my contemporaries in thinking\r\nthat the vast continental extensions (160/2. See Letters 47, 48.)\r\nof Forbes, Heer, and others are not only advanced without sufficient\r\nevidence, but are opposed to much weighty evidence. You refer to my work\r\nin the kindest and most generous spirit. I am fully satisfied at the\r\nlength in belief to which you go, and not at all surprised at the\r\nprudent reservations which you make. I remember well how many years it\r\ncost me to go round from old beliefs. It is encouraging to me to observe\r\nthat everyone who has gone an inch with me, after a period goes a few\r\nmore inches or even feet. But the great point, as it seems to me, is to\r\ngive up the immutability of specific forms; as long as they are thought\r\nimmutable, there can be no real progress in \"Epiontology.\" (160/3. See\r\nDe Candolle, loc. cit., page 67: he defines \"Epiontologie\" as the study\r\nof the distribution and succession of organised beings from their origin\r\nup to the present time. At present Epiontology is divided into geography\r\nand palaeontology, \"mais cette division trop inegale et a limites bien\r\nvagues disparaitra probablement.\") It matters very little to any one\r\nexcept myself, whether I am a little more or less wrong on this or that\r\npoint; in fact, I am sure to be proved wrong in many points. But the\r\nsubject will have, I am convinced, a grand future. Considering that\r\nbirds are the most isolated group in the animal kingdom, what a splendid\r\ncase is this Solenhofen bird-creature with its long tail and fingers to\r\nits wings! I have lately been daily and hourly using and quoting your\r\n\"Geographical Botany\" in my book on \"Variation under Domestication.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 161. TO HORACE DOBELL. Down, February 16th [1863].\r\n\r\nAbsence from home and consequent idleness are the causes that I have not\r\nsooner thanked you for your very kind present of your Lectures. (161/1.\r\n\"On the Germs and Vestiges of Disease,\" (London) 1861.) Your reasoning\r\nseems quite satisfactory (though the subject is rather beyond my limit\r\nof thought and knowledge) on the V.M.F. not being \"a given quantity.\"\r\n(161/2. \"It has been too common to consider the force exhibited in\r\nthe operations of life (the V.M.F.) as a given quantity, to which no\r\naccessions can be made, but which is apportioned to each living being in\r\nquantity sufficient for its necessities, according to some hidden law\"\r\n(op. cit., page 41.) And I can see that the conditions of life must play\r\na most important part in allowing this quantity to increase, as in the\r\nbudding of a tree, etc. How far these conditions act on \"the forms of\r\norganic life\" (page 46) I do not see clearly. In fact, no part of my\r\nsubject has so completely puzzled me as to determine what effect to\r\nattribute to (what I vaguely call) the direct action of the conditions\r\nof life. I shall before long come to this subject, and must endeavour to\r\ncome to some conclusion when I have got the mass of collected facts\r\nin some sort of order in my mind. My present impression is that I\r\nhave underrated this action in the \"Origin.\" I have no doubt when I go\r\nthrough your volume I shall find other points of interest and value to\r\nme. I have already stumbled on one case (about which I want to consult\r\nMr. Paget)--namely, on the re-growth of supernumerary digits. (161/3.\r\nSee Letters 178, 270.) You refer to \"White on Regeneration, etc., 1785.\"\r\nI have been to the libraries of the Royal and the Linnean Societies, and\r\nto the British Museum, where the librarians got out your volume and made\r\na special hunt, and could discover no trace of such a book. Will you\r\ngrant me the favour of giving me any clue, where I could see the book?\r\nHave you it? if so, and the case is given briefly, would you have the\r\ngreat kindness to copy it? I much want to know all particulars. One\r\ncase has been given me, but with hardly minute enough details, of a\r\nsupernumerary little finger which has already been twice cut off, and\r\nnow the operation will soon have to be done for the third time. I am\r\nextremely much obliged for the genealogical table; the fact of the two\r\ncousins not, as far as yet appears, transmitting the peculiarity is\r\nextraordinary, and must be given by me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 162. TO C. LYELL. [February 17th, 1863.]\r\n\r\nThe same post that brought the enclosed brought Dana's pamphlet on\r\nthe same subject. (162/1. The pamphlet referred to was published in\r\n\"Silliman's Journal,\" Volume XXV., 1863, pages 65 and 71, also in the\r\n\"Annals and Magazine of Natural History,\" Volume XI., pages 207-14,\r\n1863: \"On the Higher Subdivisions in the Classification of Mammals.\" In\r\nthis paper Dana maintains the view that \"Man's title to a position by\r\nhimself, separate from the other mammals in classification, appears\r\nto be fixed on structural as well as physical grounds\" (page 210). His\r\ndescription is as follows:--\r\n\r\n     I.  ARCHONTIA (vel DIPODA) Man (alone).\r\n\r\n     II.  MEGASTHENA.       III.  MICROSTHENA.\r\n     Quadrumana.            Cheiroptera.\r\n     Carnivora.             Insectivora.\r\n     Herbivora.             Rodentia.\r\n     Mutilata.              Bruta (Edentata).\r\n\r\n     IV.  OOTICOIDEA.\r\n     Marsupialia.\r\n     Monotremata.)\r\n\r\nThe whole seems to me utterly wild. If there had not been the foregone\r\nwish to separate men, I can never believe that Dana or any one would\r\nhave relied on so small a distinction as grown man not using fore-limbs\r\nfor locomotion, seeing that monkeys use their limbs in all other\r\nrespects for the same purpose as man. To carry on analogous principles\r\n(for they are not identical, in crustacea the cephalic limbs are brought\r\nclose to mouth) from crustacea to the classification of mammals seems\r\nto me madness. Who would dream of making a fundamental distinction in\r\nbirds, from fore-limbs not being used at all in [some] birds, or used as\r\nfins in the penguin, and for flight in other birds?\r\n\r\nI get on slowly with your grand work, for I am overwhelmed with odds and\r\nends and letters.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 163. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(163/1. The following extract refers to Owen's paper in the \"Linn. Soc.\r\nJournal,\" June, 1857, in which the classification of the Mammalia by\r\ncerebral characters was proposed. In spite of the fact that men and apes\r\nare placed in distinct Sub-Classes, Owen speaks (in the foot-note of\r\nwhich Huxley made such telling effect) of the determination of the\r\ndifference between Homo and Pithecus as the anatomist's difficulty. (See\r\nLetter 119.))\r\n\r\nJuly 5th, 1857.\r\n\r\nWhat a capital number of the \"Linnean Journal!\" Owen's is a grand paper;\r\nbut I cannot swallow Man making a division as distinct from a chimpanzee\r\nas an Ornithorhynchus from a horse; I wonder what a chimpanzee would say\r\nto this? (163/2. According to Owen the sub-class Archencephala contains\r\nonly the genus Homo: the Gyrencephala contains both chimpanzee and\r\nhorse, the Lyencephala contains Ornithorhynchus.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 164. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down [February?] 26th, 1863.\r\n\r\nI have just finished with very great interest \"Man's Place.\" (164/1.\r\n\"Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature,\" 1863 (preface dated January\r\n1863).) I never fail to admire the clearness and condensed vigour of\r\nyour style, as one calls it, but really of your thought. I have no\r\ncriticisms; nor is it likely that I could have. But I think you could\r\nhave added some interesting matter on the character or disposition of\r\nthe young ourangs which have been kept in France and England. I should\r\nhave thought you might have enlarged a little on the later embryological\r\nchanges in man and on his rudimentary structure, tail as compared with\r\ntail of higher monkeys, intermaxillary bone, false ribs, and I daresay\r\nother points, such as muscles of ears, etc., etc. I was very much\r\nstruck with admiration at the opening pages of Part II. (and oh! what a\r\ndelicious sneer, as good as a dessert, at page 106) (164/2. Huxley, op.\r\ncit., page 106. After saying that \"there is but one hypothesis regarding\r\nthe origin of species of animals in general which has any scientific\r\nexistence--that propounded by Mr. Darwin,\" and after a few words on\r\nLamarck, he goes on: \"And though I have heard of the announcement of a\r\nformula touching 'the ordained continuous becoming of organic forms,' it\r\nis obvious that it is the first duty of a hypothesis to be intelligible,\r\nand that a qua-qua-versal proposition of this kind, which may be read\r\nbackwards or forwards, or sideways, with exactly the same amount of\r\nsignificance, does not really exist, though it may seem to do so.\" The\r\n\"formula\" in question is Owen's.): but my admiration is unbounded at\r\npages 109 to 112. I declare I never in my life read anything grander.\r\nBacon himself could not have charged a few paragraphs with more\r\ncondensed and cutting sense than you have done. It is truly grand. I\r\nregret extremely that you could not, or did not, end your book (not that\r\nI mean to say a word against the Geological History) with these pages.\r\nWith a book, as with a fine day, one likes it to end with a glorious\r\nsunset. I congratulate you on its publication; but do not be\r\ndisappointed if it does not sell largely: parts are highly scientific,\r\nand I have often remarked that the best books frequently do not get soon\r\nappreciated: certainly large sale is no proof of the highest merit. But\r\nI hope it may be widely distributed; and I am rejoiced to see in your\r\nnote to Miss Rhadamanthus (164/3. This refers to Mr. Darwin's daughter\r\n(now Mrs. Litchfield), whom Mr. Huxley used to laugh at for the severity\r\nof her criticisms.) that a second thousand is called for of the little\r\nbook. What a letter that is of Owen's in the \"Athenaeum\" (164/4. A\r\nletter by Owen in the \"Athenaeum,\" February 21st, 1863, replying to\r\nstrictures on his treatment of the brain question, which had appeared\r\nin Lyell's \"Antiquity of Man.\"); how cleverly he will utterly muddle and\r\nconfound the public. Indeed he quite muddled me, till I read again your\r\n\"concise statement\" (164/5. This refers to a section (pages 113-18) in\r\n\"Man's Place in Nature,\" headed \"A succinct History of the Controversy\r\nrespecting the Cerebral Structure of Man and the Apes.\" Huxley follows\r\nthe question from Owen's attempt to classify the mammalia by cerebral\r\ncharacters, published by the \"Linn. Soc.\" in 1857, up to his revival of\r\nthe subject at the Cambridge meeting of the British Association in 1862.\r\nIt is a tremendous indictment of Owen, and seems to us to conclude\r\nnot unfittingly with a citation from Huxley's article in the \"Medical\r\nTimes,\" October 11th, 1862. Huxley here points out that special\r\ninvestigations have been made into the question at issue \"during the\r\nlast two years\" by Allen Thomson, Rolleston, Marshall, Flower, Schroeder\r\nvan der Kolk and Vrolik, and that \"all these able and conscientious\r\nobservers\" have testified to the accuracy of his statements, \"while not\r\na single anatomist, great or small, has supported Professor Owen.\" He\r\nsums up the case once more, and concludes: \"The question has thus become\r\none of personal veracity. For myself I will accept no other issue than\r\nthis, grave as it is, to the present controversy.\") (which is capitally\r\nclear), and then I saw that my suspicion was true that he has entirely\r\nchanged his ground to size of Brain. How candid he shows himself to have\r\ntaken the slipped Brain! (164/6. Owen in the \"Athenaeum,\" February 21st,\r\n1863, admits that in the brain which he used in illustration of his\r\nstatements \"the cerebral hemispheres had glided forward and apart behind\r\nso as to expose a portion of the cerebellum.\") I am intensely curious\r\nto see whether Lyell will answer. (164/7. Lyell's answer was in the\r\n\"Athenaeum\" March 7th, 1863.) Lyell has been, I fear, rather rash to\r\nenter on a subject on which he of course knows nothing by himself. By\r\nheavens, Owen will shake himself, when he sees what an antagonist he has\r\nmade for himself in you. With hearty admiration, Farewell.\r\n\r\nI am fearfully disappointed at Lyell's excessive caution (164/8. In the\r\n\"Antiquity of Man\": see \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 8.) in expressing\r\nany judgment on Species or [on the] origin of Man.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 165. TO JOHN SCOTT. Down, March 6th, 1863.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your criticisms on the \"Origin,\" and which I have not\r\ntime to discuss; but I cannot help doubting, from your expression of\r\nan \"INNATE...selective principle,\" whether you fully comprehend what\r\nis meant by Natural Selection. Certainly when you speak of weaker (i.e.\r\nless well adapted) forms crossing with the stronger, you take a widely\r\ndifferent view from what I do on the struggle for existence; for such\r\nweaker forms could not exist except by the rarest chance. With respect\r\nto utility, reflect that 99/100ths part of the structure of each being\r\nis due to inheritance of formerly useful structures. Pray read what I\r\nhave said on \"correlation.\" Orchids ought to show us how ignorant we are\r\nof what is useful. No doubt hundreds of cases could be advanced of\r\nwhich no explanation could be offered; but I must stop. Your letter has\r\ninterested me much. I am very far from strong, and have great fear that\r\nI must stop all work for a couple of months for entire rest, and leave\r\nhome. It will be ruin to all my work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 166. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 23rd [1863].\r\n\r\nThe more I think of Falconer's letter (166/1. Published in the\r\n\"Athenaeum\" April 4th, 1863, page 459. The writer asserts that Lyell did\r\nnot make it clear that certain material made use of in the \"Antiquity\r\nof Man\" was supplied by the original work of Mr. Prestwich and himself.\r\n(See \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 19.)) the more grieved I am; he and\r\nPrestwich (the latter at least must owe much to the \"Principles\") assume\r\nan absurdly unwarrantable position with respect to Lyell. It is too\r\nbad to treat an old hero in science thus. I can see from a note from\r\nFalconer (about a wonderful fossil Brazilian Mammal, well called Meso-\r\nor Typo-therium) that he expects no sympathy from me. He will end, I\r\nhope, by being sorry. Lyell lays himself open to a slap by saying that\r\nhe would come to show his original observations, and then not distinctly\r\ndoing so; he had better only have laid claim, on this one point of man,\r\nto verification and compilation.\r\n\r\nAltogether, I much like Lyell's letter. But all this squabbling will\r\ngreatly sink scientific men. I have seen a sneer already in the \"Times.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 167. TO H.W. BATES. At Rev. C. Langton, Hartfield, Tunbridge\r\nWells, April 30th [1863].\r\n\r\nYou will have received before this the note which I addressed to\r\nLeicester, after finishing Volume I., and you will have received copies\r\nof my little review (167/1. \"Nat. Hist. Review,\" 1863, page 219. A\r\nreview of Bates' paper on Mimetic Butterflies.) of your paper...I have\r\nnow finished Volume II., and my opinion remains the same--that you have\r\nwritten a truly admirable work (167/2. \"The Naturalist on the Amazons,\"\r\n1863.), with capital original remarks, first-rate descriptions, and the\r\nwhole in a style which could not be improved. My family are now reading\r\nthe book, and admire it extremely; and, as my wife remarks, it has so\r\nstrong an air of truthfulness. I had a letter from a person the other\r\nday, unknown to you, full of praise of the book. I do hope it may get\r\nextensively heard of and circulated; but to a certain extent this, I\r\nthink, always depends on chance.\r\n\r\nI suppose the clicking noise of surprise made by the Indian is that\r\nwhich the end of the tongue, applied to the palate of the mouth and\r\nsuddenly withdrawn, makes?\r\n\r\nI have not written since receiving your note of April 20th, in which\r\nyou confided in me and told me your prospects. I heartily wish they were\r\nbetter, and especially more certain; but with your abilities and powers\r\nof writing it will be strange if you cannot add what little you require\r\nfor your income. I am glad that you have got a retired and semi-rural\r\nsituation. What a grand ending you give to your book, contrasting\r\ncivilisation and wild life! I quite regret that I have finished it:\r\nevery evening it was a real treat to me to have my half-hour in the\r\ngrand Amazonian forest, and picture to myself your vivid descriptions.\r\nThere are heaps of facts of value to me in a natural history point\r\nof view. It was a great misfortune that you were prevented giving the\r\ndiscussion on species. But you will, I hope, be able to give your views\r\nand facts somewhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 168. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 15th [1863].\r\n\r\nYour letter received this morning interested me more than even most of\r\nyour letters, and that is saying a good deal. I must scribble a little\r\non several points. About Lyell and species--you put the whole case, I\r\ndo believe, when you say that he is \"half-hearted and whole-headed.\"\r\n(168/1. Darwin's disappointment with the cautious point of view taken\r\nup by Lyell in the \"Antiquity of Man\" is illustrated in the \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" III., pages 11, 13. See also Letter 164, page 239.) I wrote\r\nto A. Gray that, when I saw such men as Lyell and he refuse to judge,\r\nit put me in despair, and that I sometimes thought I should prefer that\r\nLyell had judged against modification of species rather than profess\r\ninability to decide; and I left him to apply this to himself. I am\r\nheartily rejoiced to hear that you intend to try to bring L. and F.\r\n(168/2. Falconer claimed that Lyell had not \"done justice to the part he\r\ntook in resuscitating the cave question.\" See \"Life and Letters,\" III.,\r\npage 14.) together again; but had you not better wait till they are a\r\nlittle cooled? You will do Science a real good service. Falconer never\r\nforgave Lyell for taking the Purbeck bones from him and handing them\r\nover to Owen.\r\n\r\nWith respect to island floras, if I understand rightly, we differ almost\r\nsolely how plants first got there. I suppose that at long intervals,\r\nfrom as far back as later Tertiary periods to the present time, plants\r\noccasionally arrived (in some cases, perhaps, aided by different\r\ncurrents from existing currents and by former islands), and that these\r\nold arrivals have survived little modified on the islands, but have\r\nbecome greatly modified or become extinct on the continent. If I\r\nunderstand, you believe that all islands were formerly united to\r\ncontinents, and then received all their plants and none since; and that\r\non the islands they have undergone less extinction and modification than\r\non the continent. The number of animal forms on islands, very closely\r\nallied to those on continents, with a few extremely distinct and\r\nanomalous, does not seem to me well to harmonise with your supposed view\r\nof all having formerly arrived or rather having been left together on\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 169. TO ASA GRAY. Down, May 31st [1863?].\r\n\r\nI was very glad to receive your review (169/1. The review on De\r\nCandolle's work on the Oaks (A. Gray's \"Scientific Papers,\" I., page\r\n130).) of De Candolle a week ago. It seems to me excellent, and you\r\nspeak out, I think, more plainly in favour of derivation of species than\r\nhitherto, though doubtfully about Natural Selection. Grant the first,\r\nI am easy about the second. Do you not consider such cases as all the\r\norchids next thing to a demonstration against Heer's view of species\r\narising suddenly by monstrosities?--it is impossible to imagine so many\r\nco-adaptations being formed all by a chance blow. Of course creationists\r\nwould cut the enigma.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 170. TO T.H. HUXLEY. June 27th [1863?]\r\n\r\nWhat are you doing now? I have never yet got hold of the \"Edinburgh\r\nReview,\" in which I hear you are well abused. By the way, I heard\r\nlately from Asa Gray that Wyman was delighted at \"Man's Place.\" (170/1.\r\n\"Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature,\" by T.H. Huxley, 1863.) I\r\nwonder who it is who pitches weakly, but virulently into you, in the\r\n\"Anthropological Review.\" How quiet Owen seems! I do at last begin to\r\nbelieve that he will ultimately fall in public estimation. What nonsense\r\nhe wrote in the \"Athenaeum\" (170/2. \"Athenaeum,\" March 28th, 1863. See\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" III., page 17.) on Heterogeny! I saw in his Aye-Aye\r\n(170/3. See Owen in the \"Trans. Zool. Soc.\" Volume V. The sentence\r\nreferred to seems to be the following (page 95): \"We know of no changes\r\nin progress in the Island of Madagascar, necessitating a special quest\r\nof wood-boring larvae by small quadrupeds of the Lemurine or Sciurine\r\ntypes of organisation.') paper (I think) that he sneers at the manner in\r\nwhich he supposes that we should account for the structure of its\r\nlimbs; and asks how we know that certain insects had increased in the\r\nMadagascar forests. Would it not be a good rebuff to ask him how he\r\nknows there were trees at all on the leafless plains of La Plata for his\r\nMylodons to tear down? But I must stop, for if I once begin about [him]\r\nthere will be no end. I was disappointed in the part about species in\r\nLyell. (170/4. Lyell's \"Antiquity of Man.\" See \"Life and Letters,\" III.,\r\npage 11.) You and Hooker are the only two bold men. I have had a bad\r\nspring and summer, almost constantly very unwell; but I am crawling on\r\nin my book on \"Variation under Domestication.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 171. TO C. LYELL. Down, August 14th [1863].\r\n\r\nHave you seen Bentham's remarks on species in his address to the Linnean\r\nSociety? (171/1. Presidential address before the Linnean Society by G.\r\nBentham (\"Journ. Proc. Linn. Soc.\" Volume VII., page xi., 1864).) they\r\nhave pleased me more than anything I have read for some time. I have no\r\nnews, for I have not seen a soul for months, and have had a bad\r\nspring and summer, but have managed to do a good deal of work. Emma is\r\nthreatening me to take me to Malvern, and perhaps I shall be compelled,\r\nbut it is a horrid waste of time; you must have enjoyed North Wales, I\r\nshould think, it is to me a most glorious country...\r\n\r\nIf you have not read Bates' book (171/2. Henry Walter Bates, \"The\r\nNaturalist on the River Amazons,\" 2 volumes, London, 1863. In a letter\r\nto Bates, April 18th, 1863, Darwin writes, \"It is the best work of\r\nnatural history travels ever published in England\" (\"Life and Letters,\"\r\nII., page 381.), I think it would interest you. He is second only to\r\nHumboldt in describing a tropical forest. (171/3. Quoted in \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" II., page 381.). Talking of reading, I have never got the\r\n\"Edinburgh\" (171/4. The \"Geological Evidence of the Antiquity of\r\nMan,\" by Sir Charles Lyell, and works by other authors reviewed in the\r\n\"Edinburgh Review.\" Volume CXVIII., July 1863. The writer sums up his\r\ncriticism as follows: \"Glancing at the work of Sir Charles Lyell as a\r\nwhole, it leaves the impression on our minds that we have been reading\r\nan ingenious academical thesis, rather than a work of demonstration by\r\nan original writer...There is no argument in it, and only a few facts\r\nwhich have not been stated elsewhere by Sir C. Lyell himself or by\r\nothers\" (loc. cit., page 294).), in which, I suppose, you are cut up.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 172. TO H. FALCONER. December 26th [1863].\r\n\r\nThank you for telling me about the Pliocene mammal, which is very\r\nremarkable; but has not Owen stated that the Pliocene badger is\r\nidentical with the recent? Such a case does indeed well show the\r\nstupendous duration of the same form. I have not heard of Suess'\r\npamphlet (172/1. Probably Suess's paper \"Ueber die Verschiedenheit und\r\ndie Aufeinanderfolge der tertiaren Land-faunen in der Niederung von\r\nWien.\" \"Sitz.-Ber. Wien Akad.\" XLVII., page 306, 1863.), and should much\r\nlike to learn the title, if it can be procured; but I am on different\r\nsubjects just at present. I should rather like to see it rendered\r\nhighly probable that the process of formation of a new species was short\r\ncompared to its duration--that is, if the process was allowed to be\r\nslow and long; the idea is new to me. Heer's view that new species are\r\nsuddenly formed like monsters, I feel a conviction from many reasons is\r\nfalse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.IV.--EVOLUTION, 1864-1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 173. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, January 1st, 1864.\r\n\r\nI am still unable to write otherwise than by dictation. In a letter\r\nreceived two or three weeks ago from Asa Gray he writes: \"I read lately\r\nwith gusto Wallace's expose of the Dublin man on Bees' cells, etc.\"\r\n(173/1. \"Remarks on the Rev. S. Haughton's paper on the Bee's Cell and\r\non the Origin of Species\" (\"Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist.\" XII., 1863, page\r\n303). Prof. Haughton's paper was read before the Natural History Society\r\nof Dublin, November 21st, 1862, and reprinted in the \"Ann. and Mag.\r\nNat. Hist.\" XI., 1863, page 415. See Letters 73, 74, 75.) Now, though\r\nI cannot read at present, I much want to know where this is published,\r\nthat I may procure a copy. Further on, Asa Gray says (after speaking of\r\nAgassiz's paper on Glaciers in the \"Atlantic Magazine\" and his\r\nrecent book entitled \"Method of Study\"): \"Pray set Wallace upon these\r\narticles.\" So Asa Gray seems to think much of your powers of reviewing,\r\nand I mention this as it assuredly is laudari a laudato. I hope you are\r\nhard at work, and if you are inclined to tell me, I should much like to\r\nknow what you are doing. It will be many months, I fear, before I shall\r\ndo anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 174. TO J.L.A. DE QUATREFAGES. Down, March 27th [1864?].\r\n\r\nI had heard that your work was to be translated, and I heard it with\r\npleasure; but I can take no share of credit, for I am not an active,\r\nonly an honorary member of the Society. Since writing I have finished\r\nwith extreme interest to the end your admirable work on metamorphosis.\r\n(174/1. Probably \"Metamorphoses of Man and the Lower Animals.\"\r\nTranslated by H. Lawson, 1864.) How well you are acquainted with the\r\nworks of English naturalists, and how generously you bestow honour on\r\nthem! Mr. Lubbock is my neighbour, and I have known him since he was a\r\nlittle boy; he is in every way a thoroughly good man; as is my friend\r\nHuxley. It gave me real pleasure to see you notice their works as you\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 175. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, April 11th [1864].\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your present of your \"Comp. Anatomy.\" (175/1.\r\n\"Lectures on the Elements of Comparative Anatomy,\" 1864.) When strong\r\nenough I am sure I shall read it with greatest interest. I could not\r\nresist the last chapter, of which I have read a part, and have been much\r\ninterested about the \"inspired idiot.\" (175/2. In reference to Oken\r\n(op. cit., page 282) Huxley says: \"I must confess I never read his works\r\nwithout thinking of the epithet of 'inspired idiot' applied to our own\r\nGoldsmith.\") If Owen wrote the article \"Oken\" (175/3. The article on\r\nOken in the eighth edition of the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" is signed\r\n\"R.O.\": Huxley wrote to Darwin (April 18th, 1864), \"There is not the\r\nsmallest question that Owen wrote both the article 'Oken' and the\r\n'Archetype' Book\" (Huxley's \"Life,\" I., page 250). Mr. Huxley's\r\nstatements amount to this: (1) Prof. Owen accuses Goethe of having in\r\n1820 appropriated Oken's theory of the skull, and of having given an\r\napocryphal account of how the idea occurred to himself in 1790. (2) in\r\nthe same article, page 502, Owen stated it to be questionable whether\r\nthe discoverer of the true theory of the segmental constitution of\r\nthe skull (i.e. himself) was excited to his labours, or \"in any way\r\ninfluenced by the a priori guesses of Oken.\" On this Huxley writes, page\r\n288: \"But if he himself had not been in any way influenced by Oken, and\r\nif the 'Programm' [of Oken] is a mere mass of 'a priori guesses,' how\r\ncomes it that only three years before Mr. Owen could write thus? 'Oken,\r\nce genie profond et penetrant, fut le premier qui entrevit la verite,\r\nguide par l'heureuse idee de l'arrangement des os craniens en segments,\r\ncomme ceux du rachis, appeles vertebres...'\" Later on Owen wrote:\r\n\"Cela servira pour exemple d'une examen scrupuleux des faits, d'une\r\nappreciation philosophique de leurs relations et analogies, etc.\" (From\r\n\"Principes d'Osteologie comparee, ou Recherches sur l'Archetype,\" etc.,\r\npages 155, 1855). (3) Finally Huxley says, page 289, plainly: \"The fact\r\nis that, so far from not having been 'in any way influenced' by Oken,\r\nProf. Owen's own contributions to this question are the merest Okenism,\r\nremanie.\") and the French work on the Archetype (points you do not put\r\nquite clearly), he never did a baser act...You are so good a Christian\r\nthat you will hardly understand how I chuckle over this bit of baseness.\r\nI hope you keep well and hearty; I honour your wisdom at giving up at\r\npresent Society for Science. But, on the other hand, I feel it in myself\r\npossible to get to care too much for Natural Science and too little for\r\nother things. I am getting better, I almost dare to hope permanently;\r\nfor my sickness is decidedly less--for twenty-seven days consecutively I\r\nwas sick many times daily, and lately I was five days free. I long to do\r\na little work again. The magnificent (by far the most magnificent, and\r\ntoo magnificent) compliment which you paid me at the end of your \"Origin\r\nof Species\" (175/4. A title applied to the \"Lectures to Working Men,\"\r\nthat \"green little book\" referred to in Letter 156. Speaking of Mr.\r\nDarwin's work he says (page 156): \"I believe that if you strip it of its\r\ntheoretical part, it still remains one of the greatest encyclopaedias of\r\nbiological doctrine that any one man ever brought forth; and I believe\r\nthat, if you take it as the embodiment of an hypothesis, it is destined\r\nto be the guide of biological and psychological speculation for the next\r\nthree or four generations.') I have met with reprinted from you two or\r\nthree times lately.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 175A. TO ERASMUS DARWIN. Down, June 30th, 1864.\r\n\r\n(175A.1. The preceding letter contains a reference to the prolonged\r\nperiod of ill-health which Darwin suffered in 1863 and 1864, and in this\r\nconnection the present letter is of interest.\r\n\r\nThe Copley Medal was given to him in 1864.)\r\n\r\nI had not heard a word about the Copley Medal. Please give Falconer\r\nmy cordial thanks for his interest about me. I enclose the list of\r\neverything published by me except a few unimportant papers. Ask Falconer\r\nnot to mention that I sent the list, as some one might say I had been\r\ncanvassing, which is an odious imputation. The origin of the Voyage in\r\nthe \"Beagle\" was that Fitz-Roy generously offered to give up half his\r\ncabin to any one who would volunteer to go as naturalist. Beaufort wrote\r\nto Cambridge, and I volunteered. Fitz-Roy never persuaded me to give\r\nup the voyage on account of sickness, nor did I ever think of doing so,\r\nthough I suffered considerably; but I do not believe it was the cause of\r\nmy subsequent ill-health, which has lost me so many years, and therefore\r\nI should not think the sea-sickness was worth notice. It would save you\r\ntrouble to forward this with my kindest remembrances to Falconer.\r\n\r\n\r\n(176/1. The following letter was the beginning of a correspondence with\r\nMr. B.D. Walsh, whom C.V. Riley describes as \"one of the ablest and most\r\nthorough entomologists of our time.\")\r\n\r\nLETTER 176. B.D. WALSH TO CHARLES DARWIN. Rock Island, Illinois, U.S.,\r\nApril 29th, 1864.\r\n\r\n(176/2. The words in square brackets are restorations of parts torn off\r\nthe original letter.)\r\n\r\nMore than thirty years ago I was introduced to you at your rooms in\r\nChrist's College by A.W. Grisebach, and had the pleasure of seeing your\r\nnoble collection of British Coleoptera. Some years afterwards I became a\r\nFellow of Trinity, and finally gave up my Fellowship rather than go into\r\nOrders, and came to this country. For the last five or six years I have\r\nbeen paying considerable attention to the insect fauna of the U.S., some\r\nof the fruits of which you will see in the enclosed pamphlets. Allow\r\nme to take this opportunity of thanking you for the publication of your\r\n\"Origin of Species,\" which I read three years ago by the advice of\r\na botanical friend, though I had a strong prejudice against what I\r\nsupposed then to be your views. The first perusal staggered me, the\r\nsecond convinced me, and the oftener I read it the more convinced I am\r\nof the general soundness of your theory.\r\n\r\nAs you have called upon naturalists that believe in your views to give\r\npublic testimony of their convictions, I have directed your attention on\r\nthe outside of one or two of my pamphlets to the particular passages in\r\nwhich [I] have done so. You will please accept these papers from me in\r\ntoken of my respect and admiration.\r\n\r\nAs you may see from the latest of these papers, I [have] recently made\r\nthe remarkable discover that there [are the] so-called \"three sexes\" not\r\nonly in social insects but [also in the] strictly solitary genus Cynips.\r\n\r\nWhen is your great work to make its appearance? [I should be] much\r\npleased to receive a few lines from you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 177. TO B.D. WALSH. Down, October 21st [1864].\r\n\r\nIll-health has prevented me from sooner thanking you for your very kind\r\nletter and several memoirs.\r\n\r\nI have been very much pleased to see how boldly and clearly you speak\r\nout on the modification of species. I thank you for giving me the pages\r\nof reference; but they were superfluous, for I found so many original\r\nand profound remarks that I have carefully looked through all the\r\npapers. I hope that your discovery about the Cynips (177/1. \"On\r\nDimorphism in the hymenopterous genus Cynips,\" \"Proc. Entom. Soc.\r\nPhiladelphia,\" March, 1864. Mr. Walsh's view is that Cynips quercus\r\naciculata is a dimorphous form of Cynips q. spongifica, and occurs only\r\nas a female. Cynips q. spongifica also produces spongifica females and\r\nmales from other galls at a different time of year.) will hold good, for\r\nit is a remarkable one, and I for one have often marvelled what could\r\nbe the meaning of the case. I will lend your paper to my neighbour Mr.\r\nLubbock, who I know is much interested in the subject. Incidentally I\r\nshall profit by your remarks on galls. If you have time I think a rather\r\nhopeless experiment would be worth trying; anyhow, I should have tried\r\nit had my health permitted. It is to insert a minute grain of some\r\norganic substance, together with the poison from bees, sand-wasps,\r\nichneumons, adders, and even alkaloid poisons into the tissues of\r\nfitting plants for the chance of monstrous growths being produced.\r\n(177/2. See \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 346, for an account of\r\nexperiments attempted in this direction by Mr. Darwin in 1880. On the\r\neffects of injuring plant-tissues, see Massart, \"La Cicatrisation, etc.\"\r\nin Tome LVII. of the \"Memoires Couronnes\" of the Brussels Academy.)\r\n\r\nMy health has long been poor, and I have lately suffered from a long\r\nillness which has interrupted all work, but I am now recommencing a\r\nvolume in connection with the \"Origin.\"\r\n\r\nP.S.--If you write again I should very much like to hear what your life\r\nin your new country is.\r\n\r\nWhat can be the meaning or use of the great diversity of the external\r\ngenerative organs in your cases, in Bombus, and the phytophagous\r\ncoleoptera?\r\n\r\nWhat can there be in the act of copulation necessitating such complex\r\nand diversified apparatus?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 178. TO W.H. FLOWER. Down, July 11th, 1864.\r\n\r\nI am truly obliged for all the trouble which you have taken for me, and\r\nfor your very interesting note. I had only vaguely heard it said that\r\nfrogs had a rudiment of a sixth toe; had I known that such great men\r\nhad looked to the point I should not have dreamed of looking myself. The\r\nrudiment sent to you was from a full-grown frog; so that if these bones\r\nare the two cuneiforms they must, I should think, be considered to be\r\nin a rudimentary condition. This afternoon my gardener brought in\r\nsome tadpoles with the hind-legs alone developed, and I looked at the\r\nrudiment. At this age it certainly looks extremely like a digit, for\r\nthe extremity is enlarged like that of the adjoining real toe, and\r\nthe transverse articulation seems similar. I am sorry that the case is\r\ndoubtful, for if these batrachians had six toes, I certainly think\r\nit would have thrown light on the truly extraordinary strength of\r\ninheritance in polydactylism in so many animals, and especially on the\r\npower of regeneration in amputated supernumerary digits. (178/1. In the\r\nfirst edition of \"Variation under Domestication\" the view here given is\r\nupheld, but in the second edition (Volume I., page 459) Darwin withdrew\r\nhis belief that the development of supernumerary digits in man is \"a\r\ncase of reversion to a lowly-organised progenitor provided with more\r\nthan five digits.\" See Letters 161, 270.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 179. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [October 22nd, 1864].\r\n\r\nThe Lyells have been here, and were extremely pleasant, but I saw them\r\nonly occasionally for ten minutes, and when they went I had an awful day\r\n[of illness]; but I am now slowly getting up to my former standard. I\r\nshall soon be confined to a living grave, and a fearful evil it is.\r\n\r\nI suppose you have read Tyndall. (179/1. Probably Tyndall \"On the\r\nConformation of the Alps\" (\"Phil. Mag.\" 1864, page 255).) I have now\r\ncome round again to Ramsay's view, (179/2. \"Phil. Mag.\" 1864, page 293.)\r\nfor the third or fourth time; but Lyell says when I read his discussion\r\nin the \"Elements,\" I shall recant for the fifth time. (179/3. This\r\nrefers to a discussion on the \"Connection of the predominance of Lakes\r\nwith Glacial Action\" (\"Elements,\" Edition VI., pages 168-74). Lyell\r\nadheres to the views expressed in the \"Antiquity of Man\" (1863) against\r\nRamsay's theory of the origin of lake basins by ice action.) What a\r\ncapital writer Tyndall is!\r\n\r\nIn your last note you ask what the Bardfield oxlip is. It is P. elatior\r\nof Jacq., which certainly looks, when growing, to common eyes different\r\nfrom the common oxlip. I will fight you to the death that as primrose\r\nand cowslip are different in appearance (not to mention odour,\r\nhabitat and range), and as I can now show that, when they cross, the\r\nintermediate offspring are sterile like ordinary hybrids, they must be\r\ncalled as good species as a man and a gorilla.\r\n\r\nI agree that if Scott's red cowslip grew wild or spread itself and\r\ndid not vary [into] common cowslip (and we have absolutely no proof of\r\nprimrose or cowslip varying into each other), and as it will not cross\r\nwith the cowslip, it would be a perfectly good species. The power of\r\nremaining for a good long period constant I look at as the essence of a\r\nspecies, combined with an appreciable amount of difference; and no one\r\ncan say there is not this amount of difference between primrose and\r\noxlip.\r\n\r\n\r\n(PLATE: HUGH FALCONER, 1844. From a photograph by Hill & Adamson.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 180. HUGH FALCONER TO W. SHARPEY.\r\n\r\n(180/1. Falconer had proposed Darwin for the Copley Medal of the Royal\r\nSociety (which was awarded to him in 1864), but being detained abroad,\r\nhe gave his reasons for supporting Darwin for this honour in a letter to\r\nSharpey, the Secretary of the Royal Society. A copy of the letter here\r\nprinted seems to have been given to Erasmus Darwin, and by him shown to\r\nhis brother Charles.)\r\n\r\nMontauban, October 25th, 1864.\r\n\r\nBusk and myself have made every effort to be back in London by the 27th\r\ninst., but we have been persecuted by mishaps--through the breakdown\r\nof trains, diligences, etc., so that we have been sadly put out in our\r\nreckoning--and have lost some of the main objects that brought us round\r\nby this part of France--none of which were idle or unimportant.\r\n\r\nBusk started yesterday for Paris from Bruniquel, to make sure of being\r\npresent at the meeting of the Royal Council on Thursday. He will tell\r\nyou that there were strong reasons for me remaining behind him. But as I\r\nseconded the proposal of Mr. Darwin for the Copley Medal, in default of\r\nmy presence at the first meeting, I beg that you will express my great\r\nregrets to the President and Council at not being there, and that I am\r\nvery reluctantly detained. I shall certainly be in London (D.V.) by the\r\nsecond meeting on the 3rd proximo. Meanwhile I solicit the favour of\r\nbeing heard, through you, respecting the grounds upon which I seconded\r\nMr. Darwin's nomination for the Copley Medal.\r\n\r\nReferring to the classified list which I drew up of Mr. Darwin's\r\nscientific labours, ranging through the wide field of (1) Geology, (2)\r\nPhysical Geography, (3) Zoology, (4) physiological Botany, (5) genetic\r\nBiology, and to the power with which he has investigated whatever\r\nsubject he has taken up,--Nullum quod tetigit non ornavit,--I am of\r\nopinion that Mr. Darwin is not only one of the most eminent naturalists\r\nof his day, but that hereafter he will be regarded as one of the great\r\nnaturalists of all countries and of all time. His early work on the\r\nstructure and distribution of coral reefs constitutes an era in the\r\ninvestigation of the subject. As a monographic labour, it may be\r\ncompared with Dr. Wells' \"Essay upon Dew,\" as original, exhaustive, and\r\ncomplete--containing the closest observation with large and important\r\ngeneralisations.\r\n\r\nAmong the zoologists his monographs upon the Balanidae and Lepadidae,\r\nFossil and Recent, in the Palaeontographical and Ray Societies'\r\npublications, are held to be models of their kind.\r\n\r\nIn physiological Botany, his recent researches upon the dimorphism of\r\nthe genital organs in certain plants, embodied in his papers in the\r\n\"Linnean Journal,\" on Primula, Linum, and Lythrum, are of the highest\r\norder of importance. They open a new mine of observation upon a field\r\nwhich had been barely struck upon before. The same remark applies to his\r\nresearches on the structure and various adaptations of the orchideous\r\nflower to a definite object connected with impregnation of the plants\r\nthrough the agency of insects with foreign pollen. There has not yet\r\nbeen time for their due influence being felt in the advancement of the\r\nscience. But in either subject they constitute an advance per saltum.\r\nI need not dwell upon the value of his geological researches, which\r\nwon for him one of the earlier awards of the Wollaston Medal from the\r\nGeological Society, the best of judges on the point.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, Mr. Darwin's great essay on the \"Origin of Species\" by\r\nNatural Selection. This solemn and mysterious subject had been either so\r\nlightly or so grotesquely treated before, that it was hardly regarded as\r\nbeing within the bounds of legitimate philosophical investigation. Mr.\r\nDarwin, after twenty years of the closest study and research, published\r\nhis views, and it is sufficient to say that they instantly fixed the\r\nattention of mankind throughout the civilised world. That the efforts of\r\na single mind should have arrived at success on a subject of such vast\r\nscope, and encompassed with such difficulties, was more than could have\r\nbeen reasonably expected, and I am far from thinking that Charles Darwin\r\nhas made out all his case. But he has treated it with such power and in\r\nsuch a philosophical and truth-seeking spirit, and illustrated it with\r\nsuch an amount of original and collated observation as fairly to have\r\nbrought the subject within the bounds of rational scientific research.\r\nI consider this great essay on genetic Biology to constitute a strong\r\nadditional claim on behalf of Mr. Darwin for the Copley Medal. (180/2.\r\nThe following letter (December 3rd, 1864), from Mr. Huxley to Sir J.D.\r\nHooker, is reprinted, by the kind permission of Mr. L. Huxley, from his\r\nfather's \"Life,\" I., page 255. Sabine's address (from the \"Reader\") is\r\ngiven in the \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 28. In the \"Proceedings of\r\nthe Royal Society\" the offending sentence is slightly modified. It is\r\nsaid, in Huxley's \"Life\" (loc. cit., note), that the sentence which\r\nfollows it was introduced to mitigate the effect:--\r\n\r\n\"I wish you had been at the anniversary meeting and dinner, because the\r\nlatter was very pleasant, and the former, to me, very disagreeable. My\r\ndistrust of Sabine is, as you know, chronic; and I went determined to\r\nkeep careful watch on his address, lest some crafty phrase injurious to\r\nDarwin should be introduced. My suspicions were justified, the only part\r\nof the address [relating] to Darwin written by Sabine himself containing\r\nthe following passage:\r\n\r\n\"'Speaking generally and collectively, we have expressly omitted it\r\n[Darwin's theory] from the grounds of our award.'\r\n\r\n\"Of course this would be interpreted by everybody as meaning that after\r\ndue discussion, the council had formally resolved not only to exclude\r\nDarwin's theory from the grounds of the award, but to give public notice\r\nthrough the president that they had done so, and, furthermore, that\r\nDarwin's friends had been base enough to accept an honour for him on the\r\nunderstanding that in receiving it he should be publicly insulted!\r\n\r\n\"I felt that this would never do, and therefore, when the resolution for\r\nprinting the address was moved, I made a speech, which I took care\r\nto keep perfectly cool and temperate, disavowing all intention of\r\ninterfering with the liberty of the president to say what he pleased,\r\nbut exercising my constitutional right of requiring the minutes of\r\ncouncil making the award to be read, in order that the Society might be\r\ninformed whether the conditions implied by Sabine had been imposed or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\"The resolution was read, and of course nothing of the kind appeared.\r\nSabine didn't exactly like it, I believe. Both Busk and Falconer\r\nremonstrated against the passage to him, and I hope it will be withdrawn\r\nwhen the address is printed. If not, there will be an awful row, and I\r\nfor one will show no mercy.\")\r\n\r\nIn forming an estimate of the value and extent of Mr. Darwin's\r\nresearches, due regard ought to be had to the circumstances under which\r\nthey have been carried out--a pressure of unremitting disease, which\r\nhas latterly left him not more than one or two hours of the day which he\r\ncould call his own.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 181. TO HUGH FALCONER. Down, November 4th [1864].\r\n\r\nWhat a good kind friend you are! I know well that this medal must have\r\ncost you a deal of trouble. It is a very great honour to me, but I\r\ndeclare the knowledge that you and a few other friends have interested\r\nthemselves on the subject is the real cream of the enjoyment to me;\r\nindeed, it is to me worth far more than many medals. So accept my true\r\nand cordial thanks. I hope that I may yet have strength to do a little\r\nmore work in Natural Science, shaky and old though I be. I have chuckled\r\nand triumphed over your postscript about poor M. Brulle and his young\r\npupils (181/1. The following is the postscript in a letter from Falconer\r\nto Darwin November 3rd [1864]: \"I returned last night from Spain via\r\nFrance. On Monday I was at Dijon, where, while in the Museum, M. Brulle,\r\nProfessor of Zoology, asked me what was my frank opinion of Charles\r\nDarwin's doctrine? He told me in despair that he could not get his\r\npupils to listen to anything from him except a la Darwin! He, poor man,\r\ncould not comprehend it, and was still unconvinced, but that all young\r\nFrenchmen would hear or believe nothing else.\") About a week ago I had\r\na nearly similar account from Germany, and at the same time I heard of\r\nsome splendid converts in such men as Leuckart, Gegenbauer, etc. You may\r\nsay what you like about yourself, but I look at a man who treats natural\r\nhistory in the same spirit with which you do, exactly as good, for what\r\nI believe to be the truth, as a convert.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 182. TO HUGH FALCONER. Down, November 8th [1864].\r\n\r\nYour remark on the relation of the award of the medal and the present\r\noutburst of bigotry had not occurred to me. It seems very true, and\r\nmakes me the more gratified to receive it. General Sabine (182/1. See\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" III., page 28.) wrote to me and asked me to attend\r\nat the anniversary, but I told him it was really impossible. I have\r\nnever been able to conjecture the cause; but I find that on my good\r\ndays, when I can write for a couple of hours, that anything which stirs\r\nme up like talking for half or even a quarter of an hour, generally\r\nquite prostrates me, sometimes even for a long time afterwards. I\r\nbelieve attending the anniversary would possibly make me seriously ill.\r\nI should enjoy attending and shaking you and a few of my other friends\r\nby the hand, but it would be folly even if I did not break down at the\r\ntime. I told Sabine that I did not know who had proposed and seconded\r\nme for the medal, but that I presumed it was you, or Hooker or Busk, and\r\nthat I felt sure, if you attended, you would receive the medal for me;\r\nand that if none of you attended, that Lyell or Huxley would receive it\r\nfor me. Will you receive it, and it could be left at my brother's?\r\n\r\nAgain accept my cordial and enduring thanks for all your kindness and\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 183. TO B.D. WALSH. Down, December 4th [1864].\r\n\r\nI have been greatly interested by your account of your American life.\r\nWhat an extraordinary and self-contained life you have led! and what\r\nvigour of mind you must possess to follow science with so much ardour\r\nafter all that you have undergone! I am very much obliged to you for\r\nyour pamphlet on Geographical Distribution, on Agassiz, etc. (183/1. Mr.\r\nWalsh's paper \"On certain Entomological Speculations of the New England\r\nSchool of Entomologists\" was published in the \"Proc. Entomolog. Soc. of\r\nPhiladelphia,\" September 1864, page 207.) I am delighted at the manner\r\nin which you have bearded this lion in his den. I agree most entirely\r\nwith all that you have written. What I meant when I wrote to Agassiz\r\nto thank him for a bundle of his publications, was exactly what you\r\nsuppose. (183/2. Namely, that Mr. Darwin, having been abused as an\r\natheist, etc., by other writers, probably felt grateful to a writer who\r\nwas willing to allow him \"a spirit as reverential as his own.\" (\"Methods\r\nof Study,\" Preface, page iv.) I confess, however, I did not fully\r\nperceive how he had misstated my views; but I only skimmed through\r\nhis \"Methods of Study,\" and thought it a very poor book. I am so much\r\naccustomed to be utterly misrepresented that it hardly excites my\r\nattention. But you really have hit the nail on the head capitally. All\r\nthe younger good naturalists whom I know think of Agassiz as you do; but\r\nhe did grand service about glaciers and fish. About the succession of\r\nforms, Pictet has given up his whole views, and no geologist now agrees\r\nwith Agassiz. I am glad that you have attacked Dana's wild notions;\r\n[though] I have a great respect for Dana...If you have an opportunity,\r\nread in \"Trans. Linn. Soc.\" Bates on \"Mimetic Lepidoptera of Amazons.\" I\r\nwas delighted with his paper.\r\n\r\nI have got a notice of your views about the female Cynips inserted in\r\nthe \"Natural History Review\" (183/3. \"Nat. Hist. Review,\" January 1865,\r\npage 139. A notice by \"J.L.\" (probably Lord Avebury) on Walsh's paper\r\n\"On Dimorphism in the Hymenopterous Genus Cynips,\" in the \"Proc.\r\nEntomolog. Soc. of Philadelphia,\" March, 1864.): whether the notice will\r\nbe favourable, I do not know, but anyhow it will call attention to your\r\nviews...\r\n\r\nAs you allude in your paper to the believers in change of species, you\r\nwill be glad to hear that very many of the very best men are coming\r\nround in Germany. I have lately heard of Hackel, Gegenbauer, F. Muller,\r\nLeuckart, Claparede, Alex. Braun, Schleiden, etc. So it is, I hear, with\r\nthe younger Frenchmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 184. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 19th [1865].\r\n\r\nIt is working hours, but I am trying to take a day's holiday, for I\r\nfinished and despatched yesterday my Climbing paper. For the last ten\r\ndays I have done nothing but correct refractory sentences, and I loathe\r\nthe whole subject like tartar emetic. By the way, I am convinced that\r\nyou want a holiday, and I think so because you took the devil's name in\r\nvain so often in your last note. Can you come here for Sunday? You know\r\nhow I should like it, and you will be quiet and dull enough here to get\r\nplenty of rest. I have been thinking with regret about what you said\r\nin one of your later notes, about having neglected to make notes on the\r\ngradation of character in your genera; but would it be too late? Surely\r\nif you looked over names in series the facts would come back, and\r\nyou might surely write a fine paper \"On the gradation of important\r\ncharacters in the genera of plants.\" As for unimportant characters, I\r\nhave made their perfect gradation a very prominent point with respect\r\nto the means of climbing, in my paper. I begin to think that one of the\r\ncommonest means of transition is the same individual plant having the\r\nsame part in different states: thus Corydalis claviculata, if you look\r\nto one leaf, may be called a tendril-bearer; if you look to another leaf\r\nit may be called a leaf-climber. Now I am sure I remember some cases\r\nwith plants in which important parts such as the position of the ovule\r\ndiffer: differences in the spire of leaves on lateral and terminal\r\nbranches, etc.\r\n\r\nThere was not much in last \"Natural History Review\" which interested\r\nme except colonial floras (184/1. \"Nat. Hist. Review,\" 1865, page 46.\r\nA review of Grisebach's \"Flora of the British West Indian Islands\" and\r\nThwaites' \"Enumeratio Plantarum Zeylaniae.\" The point referred to is\r\ngiven at page 57: \"More than half the Flowering Plants belong to eleven\r\nOrders in the case of the West Indies, and to ten in that of Ceylon,\r\nwhilst with but one exception the Ceylon Orders are the same as the West\r\nIndian.\" The reviewer speculates on the meaning of the fact \"in relation\r\nto the hypothesis of an intertropical cold epoch, such as Mr. Darwin\r\ndemands for the migration of the Northern Flora to the Southern\r\nhemisphere.\") and the report on the sexuality of cryptogams. I\r\nsuppose the former was by Oliver; how extremely curious is the fact\r\nof similarity of Orders in the Tropics! I feel a conviction that it\r\nis somehow connected with Glacial destruction, but I cannot \"wriggle\"\r\ncomfortably at all on the subject. I am nearly sure that Dana makes out\r\nthat the greatest number of crustacean forms inhabit warmer temperate\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nI have had an enormous letter from Leo Lesquereux (after doubts, I did\r\nnot think it worth sending you) on Coal Flora: he wrote some excellent\r\narticles in \"Silliman\" again [my] \"Origin\" views; but he says now after\r\nrepeated reading of the book he is a convert! But how funny men's minds\r\nare! he says he is chiefly converted because my books make the Birth of\r\nChrist, Redemption by Grace, etc., plain to him!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 185. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, February 9th [1865].\r\n\r\nI quite agree how humiliating the slow progress of man is, but every\r\none has his own pet horror, and this slow progress or even personal\r\nannihilation sinks in my mind into insignificance compared with the idea\r\nor rather I presume certainty of the sun some day cooling and we all\r\nfreezing. To think of the progress of millions of years, with every\r\ncontinent swarming with good and enlightened men, all ending in this,\r\nand with probably no fresh start until this our planetary system has\r\nbeen again converted into red-hot gas. Sic transit gloria mundi, with a\r\nvengeance...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 186. TO B.D. WALSH. Down, March 27th [1865].\r\n\r\nI have been much interested by your letter. I received your former\r\npaper on Phytophagic variety (186/1. For \"Phytophagic Varieties and\r\nPhytophagic Species\" see \"Proc. Entomolog. Soc. Philadelphia,\" November\r\n1864, page 403, also December 1865. The part on gradation is summarised\r\nat pages 427, 428. Walsh shows that a complete gradation exists between\r\nspecies which are absolutely unaffected by change of food and cases\r\nwhere \"difference of food is accompanied by marked and constant\r\ndifferences, either colorational, or structural, or both, in the larva,\r\npupa and imago states.\"), most of which was new to me. I have since\r\nreceived your paper on willow-galls; this has been very opportune, as I\r\nwanted to learn a little about galls. There was much in this paper which\r\nhas interested me extremely, on gradations, etc., and on your \"unity\r\nof coloration.\" (186/2. \"Unity of coloration\": this expression does not\r\nseem to occur in the paper of November 1864, but is discussed at length\r\nin that of December 1865, page 209.) This latter subject is nearly new\r\nto me, though I collected many years ago some such cases with birds; but\r\nwhat struck me most was when a bird genus inhabits two continents, the\r\ntwo sections sometimes display a somewhat different type of colouring.\r\nI should like to hear whether this does not occur with widely ranging\r\ninsect-genera? You may like to hear that Wichura (186/3. Max Wichura's\r\n\"Die Bastarde befruchtung im Pflanzenreich, etc:\" Breslau 1865. A\r\ntranslation appeared in the \"Bibliotheque Universelle,\" xxiii., page\r\n129: Geneva 1865.) has lately published a book which has quite convinced\r\nme that in Europe there is a multitude of spontaneous hybrid willows.\r\nWould it not be very interesting to know how the gall-makers behaved\r\nwith respect to these hybrids? Do you think it likely that the ancestor\r\nof Cecidomyia acquired its poison like gnats (which suck men) for no\r\nespecial purpose (at least not for gall-making)? Such notions make me\r\nwish that some one would try the experiments suggested in my former\r\nletter. Is it not probable that guest-flies were aboriginally\r\ngall-makers, and bear the same relation to them which Apathus probably\r\ndoes to Bombus? (186/4. Apathus (= Psithyrus) lives in the nests of\r\nBombus. These insects are said to be so like humble bees that \"they were\r\nnot distinguished from them by the early entomologists:\" Dr. Sharp in\r\n\"Cambridge Nat. Hist. (Insects,\" Part II.), page 59.) With respect\r\nto dimorphism, you may like to hear that Dr. Hooker tells me that\r\na dioecious parasitic plant allied to Rafflesia has its two sexes\r\nparasitic on two distinct species of the same genus of plants; so look\r\nout for some such case in the two forms of Cynips. I have posted to you\r\ncopies of my papers on dimorphism. Leersia (186/5. Leersia oryzoides\r\nwas for a long time thought to produce only cleistogamic and therefore\r\nautogamous flowers. See \"Variation of Animals and Plants,\" Edition II.,\r\nVolume II., page 69.) does behave in a state of nature in the provoking\r\nmanner described by me. With respect to Wagner's curious discovery my\r\nopinion is worth nothing; no doubt it is a great anomaly, but it does\r\nnot appear to me nearly so incredible as to you. Remember how allied\r\nforms in the Hydrozoa differ in their so-called alternate generations;\r\nI follow those naturalists who look at all such cases as forms of\r\ngemmation; and a multitude of organisms have this power or traces\r\nof this power at all ages from the germ to maturity. With respect to\r\nAgassiz's views, there were many, and there are still not a few, who\r\nbelieve that the same species is created on many spots. I wrote to\r\nBates, and he will send you his mimetic paper; and I dare say others: he\r\nis a first-rate man.\r\n\r\nYour case of the wingless insects near the Rocky Mountains is extremely\r\ncurious. I am sure I have heard of some such case in the Old World:\r\nI think on the Caucasus. Would not my argument about wingless insular\r\ninsects perhaps apply to truly Alpine insects? for would it not be\r\ndestruction to them to be blown from their proper home? I should like to\r\nwrite on many points at greater length to you, but I have no strength to\r\nspare.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 187. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, September 22nd [1865].\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your extract (187/1. Mr. Wallace had sent Darwin\r\na note about a tufted cock-blackbird, which transmitted the character\r\nto some of its offspring.); I never heard of such a case, though such\r\na variation is perhaps the most likely of any to occur in a state of\r\nnature, and to be inherited, inasmuch as all domesticated birds present\r\nraces with a tuft or with reversed feathers on their heads. I have\r\nsometimes thought that the progenitor of the whole class must have been\r\na crested animal.\r\n\r\nDo you make any progress with your journal of travels? I am the more\r\nanxious that you should do so as I have lately read with much interest\r\nsome papers by you on the ourang-outan, etc., in the \"Annals,\" of which\r\nI have lately been reading the later volumes. I have always thought that\r\njournals of this nature do considerable good by advancing the taste for\r\nNatural History: I know in my own case that nothing ever stimulated my\r\nzeal so much as reading Humboldt's \"Personal Narrative.\" I have not yet\r\nreceived the last part of the \"Linnean Transactions,\" but your paper\r\n(187/2. Probably on the variability and distribution of the butterflies\r\nof the Malayan region: \"Linn. Soc. Trans.\" XXV., 1866.) at present will\r\nbe rather beyond my strength, for though somewhat better, I can as yet\r\ndo hardly anything but lie on the sofa and be read aloud to. By the\r\nway, have you read Tylor and Lecky? (187/3. Tylor, \"Early History of\r\nMankind;\" Lecky's \"Rationalism.\") Both these books have interested me\r\nmuch. I suppose you have read Lubbock. (187/4. Lubbock, \"Prehistoric\r\nTimes,\" page 479: \"...the theory of Natural Selection, which with\r\ncharacteristic unselfishness he ascribes unreservedly to Mr. Darwin.\")\r\nIn the last chapter there is a note about you in which I most cordially\r\nconcur. I see you were at the British Association but I have heard\r\nnothing of it except what I have picked up in the \"Reader.\" I have heard\r\na rumour that the \"Reader\" is sold to the Anthropological Society. If\r\nyou do not begrudge the trouble of another note (for my sole channel of\r\nnews through Hooker is closed by his illness) I should much like to hear\r\nwhether the \"Reader\" is thus sold. I should be very sorry for it, as the\r\npaper would thus become sectional in its tendency. If you write, tell\r\nme what you are doing yourself. The only news which I have about the\r\n\"Origin\" is that Fritz Muller published a few months ago a remarkable\r\nbook (187/5. \"Fur Darwin.\") in its favour, and secondly that a second\r\nFrench edition is just coming out.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 188. TO F. MULLER. Down, January 11th [1866].\r\n\r\nI received your interesting letter of November 5th some little time ago,\r\nand despatched immediately a copy of my \"Journal of Researches.\" I\r\nfear you will think me troublesome in my offer; but have you the second\r\nGerman edition of the \"Origin?\" which is a translation, with additions,\r\nof the third English edition, and is, I think, considerably improved\r\ncompared with the first edition. I have some spare copies which are of\r\nno use to me, and it would be a pleasure to me to send you one, if it\r\nwould be of any use to you. You would never require to re-read the book,\r\nbut you might wish to refer to some passage. I am particularly obliged\r\nfor your photograph, for one likes to have a picture in one's mind of\r\nany one about whom one is interested. I have received and read with\r\ninterest your paper on the sponge with horny spicula. (188/1. \"Ueber\r\nDarwinella aurea, einen Schwamm mit sternformigen Hornnadeln.\"--\"Archiv.\r\nMikrosk. Anat.\" I., page 57, 1866.) Owing to ill-health, and being\r\nbusy when formerly well, I have for some years neglected periodical\r\nscientific literature, and have lately been reading up, and have thus\r\nread translations of several of your papers; amongst which I have been\r\nparticularly glad to read and see the drawings of the metamorphoses\r\nof Peneus. (188/2. \"On the Metamorphoses of the Prawns,\" by Dr. Fritz\r\nMuller.--\"Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.\" Volume XIV., page 104 (with plate),\r\n1864. Translated by W.S. Dallas from \"Wiegmann's Archiv,\" 1863 (see also\r\n\"Facts and Arguments for Darwin,\" passim, translated by W.S. Dallas:\r\nLondon, 1869).) This seems to me the most interesting discovery in\r\nembryology which has been made for years.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged to you for telling me a little of your plans for the\r\nfuture; what a strange, but to my taste interesting life you will lead\r\nwhen you retire to your estate on the Itajahy!\r\n\r\nYou refer in your letter to the facts which Agassiz is collecting,\r\nagainst our views, on the Amazons. Though he has done so much for\r\nscience, he seems to me so wild and paradoxical in all his views that I\r\ncannot regard his opinions as of any value.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 189. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, January 22nd, 1866.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your paper on pigeons (189/1. \"On the Pigeons of the\r\nMalay Archipelago\" (The \"Ibis,\" October, 1865). Mr. Wallace points out\r\n(page 366) that \"the most striking superabundance of pigeons, as well\r\nas of parrots, is confined to the Australo-Malayan sub-region in\r\nwhich...the forest-haunting and fruit-eating mammals, such as monkeys\r\nand squirrels, are totally absent.\" He points out also that monkeys are\r\n\"exceedingly destructive to eggs and young birds.\"), which interested\r\nme, as everything that you write does. Who would ever have dreamed that\r\nmonkeys influenced the distribution of pigeons and parrots! But I have\r\nhad a still higher satisfaction, for I finished your paper yesterday in\r\nthe \"Linnean Transactions.\" (189/2. \"Linn. Soc. Trans.\" XXV.: a paper\r\non the geographical distribution and variability of the Malayan\r\nPapilionidae.) It is admirably done. I cannot conceive that the most\r\nfirm believer in species could read it without being staggered. Such\r\npapers will make many more converts among naturalists than long-winded\r\nbooks such as I shall write if I have strength. I have been particularly\r\nstruck with your remarks on dimorphism; but I cannot quite understand\r\none point (page 22), (189/3. The passage referred to in this letter as\r\nneeding further explanation is the following: \"The last six cases of\r\nmimicry are especially instructive, because they seem to indicate one of\r\nthe processes by which dimorphic forms have been produced. When, as in\r\nthese cases, one sex differs much from the other, and varies greatly\r\nitself, it may happen that individual variations will occasionally\r\noccur, having a distant resemblance to groups which are the objects\r\nof mimicry, and which it is therefore advantageous to resemble. Such\r\na variety will have a better chance of preservation; the individuals\r\npossessing it will be multiplied; and their accidental likeness to the\r\nfavoured group will be rendered permanent by hereditary transmission,\r\nand each successive variation which increases the resemblance being\r\npreserved, and all variations departing from the favoured type having\r\nless chance of preservation, there will in time result those singular\r\ncases of two or more isolated and fixed forms bound together by that\r\nintimate relationship which constitutes them the sexes of a single\r\nspecies. The reason why the females are more subject to this kind of\r\nmodification than the males is, probably, that their slower flight,\r\nwhen laden with eggs, and their exposure to attack while in the act of\r\ndepositing their eggs upon leaves, render it especially advantageous\r\nfor them to have some additional protection. This they at once obtain\r\nby acquiring a resemblance to other species which, from whatever cause,\r\nenjoy a comparative immunity from persecution.\" Mr. Wallace has been\r\ngood enough to give us the following note on the above passage: \"The\r\nabove quotation deals solely with the question of how certain females\r\nof the polymorphic species (Papilio Memnon, P. Pammon, and others) have\r\nbeen so modified as to mimic species of a quite distinct section of\r\nthe genus; but it does not attempt to explain why or how the other very\r\nvariable types of female arose, and this was Darwin's difficulty. As\r\nthe letter I wrote in reply is lost, and as it is rather difficult to\r\nexplain the matter clearly without reference to the coloured figures,\r\nI must go into some little detail, and give now what was probably the\r\nexplanation I gave at the time. The male of Papilio Memnon is a large\r\nblack butterfly with the nervures towards the margins of the wings\r\nbordered with bluish gray dots. It is a forest insect, and the very\r\ndark colour renders it conspicuous; but it is a strong flier, and thus\r\nsurvives. To the female, however, this conspicuous mass of colour\r\nwould be dangerous, owing to her slower flight, and the necessity for\r\ncontinually resting while depositing her eggs on the leaves of the\r\nfood-plant of the larva. She has accordingly acquired lighter and more\r\nvaried tints. The marginal gray-dotted stripes of the male have become\r\nof a brownish ash and much wider on the fore wings, while the margin\r\nof the hind wings is yellowish, with a more defined spot near the\r\nanal angle. This is the form most nearly like the male, but it is\r\ncomparatively rare, the more common being much lighter in colour, the\r\nbluish gray of the hind wings being often entirely replaced by a broad\r\nband of yellowish white. The anal angle is orange-yellow, and there is\r\na bright red spot at the base of the fore wings. Between these two\r\nextremes there is every possible variation. Now, it is quite certain\r\nthat this varying mixture of brown, black, white, yellow, and red is far\r\nless conspicuous amid the ever-changing hues of the forest with their\r\nglints of sunshine everywhere penetrating so as to form strong contrasts\r\nand patches of light and shade. Hence ALL the females--one at one time\r\nand one at another--get SOME protection, and that is sufficient to\r\nenable them to live long enough to lay their eggs, when their work is\r\nfinished. Still, under bad conditions they only just managed to\r\nsurvive, and as the colouring of some of these varying females very\r\nmuch resembled that of the protected butterflies of the P. coon\r\ngroup (perhaps at a time when the tails of the latter were not fully\r\ndeveloped) any rudiments of a prolongation of the wing into a tail added\r\nto the protective resemblance, and was therefore preserved. The woodcuts\r\nof some of these forms in my \"Malay Archipelago\" (i., page 200) will\r\nenable those who have this book at hand better to understand the\r\nforegoing explanation.\"), and should be grateful for an explanation, for\r\nI want fully to understand you. How can one female form be selected and\r\nthe intermediate forms die out, without also the other extreme form also\r\ndying out from not having the advantages of the first selected form?\r\nfor, as I understand, both female forms occur on the same island. I\r\nquite agree with your distinction between dimorphic forms and varieties;\r\nbut I doubt whether your criterion of dimorphic forms not producing\r\nintermediate offspring will suffice, for I know of a good many varieties\r\nwhich must be so called that will not blend or intermix, but produce\r\noffspring quite like either parent.\r\n\r\nI have been particularly struck with your remarks on geographical\r\ndistribution in Celebes. It is impossible that anything could be better\r\nput, and would give a cold shudder to the immutable naturalists.\r\n\r\nAnd now I am going to ask a question which you will not like. How does\r\nyour journal get on? It will be a shame if you do not popularise your\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 190. A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN. Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, July\r\n2nd, 1866.\r\n\r\nI have been so repeatedly struck by the utter inability of numbers\r\nof intelligent persons to see clearly, or at all, the self-acting and\r\nnecessary effects of Natural Selection, that I am led to conclude that\r\nthe term itself, and your mode of illustrating it, however clear and\r\nbeautiful to many of us, are yet not the best adapted to impress it\r\non the general naturalist public. The two last cases of the\r\nmisunderstanding are: (1) the article on \"Darwin and his Teachings\" in\r\nthe last \"Quarterly Journal of Science,\" which, though very well written\r\nand on the whole appreciative, yet concludes with a charge of something\r\nlike blindness, in your not seeing that Natural Selection requires the\r\nconstant watching of an intelligent \"chooser,\" like man's selection to\r\nwhich you so often compare it; and (2) in Janet's recent work on the\r\n\"Materialism of the Present Day,\" reviewed in last Saturday's \"Reader,\"\r\nby an extract from which I see that he considers your weak point to be\r\nthat you do not see that \"thought and direction are essential to the\r\naction of Natural Selection.\" The same objection has been made a score\r\nof times by your chief opponents, and I have heard it as often stated\r\nmyself in conversation. Now, I think this arises almost entirely from\r\nyour choice of the term \"Natural Selection\" and so constantly comparing\r\nit in its effects to Man's Selection, and also your so frequently\r\npersonifying nature as \"selecting,\" as \"preferring,\" as \"seeking only\r\nthe good of the species,\" etc., etc. To the few this is as clear as\r\ndaylight, and beautifully suggestive, but to many it is evidently a\r\nstumbling-block. I wish, therefore, to suggest to you the possibility\r\nof entirely avoiding this source of misconception in your great work (if\r\nnot now too late), and also in any future editions of the \"Origin,\"\r\nand I think it may be done without difficulty and very effectually\r\nby adopting Spencer's term (which he generally uses in preference to\r\nNatural Selection)--viz., \"survival of the fittest.\"\r\n\r\nThis term is the plain expression of the fact; Natural Selection is\r\na metaphorical expression of it, and to a certain degree indirect and\r\nincorrect, since, even personifying Nature, she does not so much select\r\nspecial variations as exterminate the most unfavourable ones.\r\n\r\nCombined with the enormous multiplying powers of all organisms, and the\r\n\"struggle for existence\" leading to the constant destruction of by far\r\nthe largest proportion--facts which no one of your opponents, as far as\r\nI am aware, has denied or misunderstood--\"the survival of the fittest\"\r\nrather than of those who were less fit could not possibly be denied or\r\nmisunderstood. Neither would it be possible to say that to ensure the\r\n\"survival of the fittest\" any intelligent chooser was necessary; whereas\r\nwhen you say Natural Selection acts so as to choose those that are\r\nfittest, it IS misunderstood, and apparently always will be. Referring\r\nto your book, I find such expressions as \"Man selects only for his\r\nown good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends.\" This, it\r\nseems, will always be misunderstood; but if you had said \"Man selects\r\nonly for his own good; Nature, by the inevitable 'survival of the\r\nfittest,' only for that of the being she tends,\" it would have been less\r\nliable to be so.\r\n\r\nI find you use the term \"Natural Selection\" in two senses: (1) for\r\nthe simple preservation of favourable and rejection of unfavourable\r\nvariations, in which case it is equivalent to \"survival of the fittest\";\r\nand (2) for the effect or change produced by this preservation, as when\r\nyou say, \"To sum up the circumstances favourable or unfavourable to\r\nNatural Selection,\" and again, \"Isolation, also, is an important element\r\nin the process of Natural Selection.\" Here it is not merely \"survival\r\nof the fittest,\" but change produced by survival of the fittest, that\r\nis meant. On looking over your fourth chapter, I find that these\r\nalterations of terms can be in most cases easily made, while in some\r\ncases the addition of \"or survival of the fittest\" after \"Natural\r\nSelection\" would be best; and in others, less likely to be\r\nmisunderstood, the original term may stand alone.\r\n\r\nI could not venture to propose to any other person so great an\r\nalteration of terms, but you, I am sure, will give it an impartial\r\nconsideration, and if you really think the change will produce a better\r\nunderstanding of your work, will not hesitate to adopt it.\r\n\r\nIt is evidently also necessary not to personify \"Nature\" too\r\nmuch--though I am very apt to do it myself--since people will not\r\nunderstand that all such phrases are metaphors. Natural Selection is,\r\nwhen understood, so necessary and self-evident a principle, that it is a\r\npity it should be in any way obscured; and it therefore seems to me\r\nthat the free use of \"survival of the fittest,\" which is a compact and\r\naccurate definition of it, would tend much to its being more widely\r\naccepted, and prevent it being so much misrepresented and misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThere is another objection made by Janet which is also a very common\r\none. It is that the chances are almost infinite against the particular\r\nkind of variation required being coincident with each change of external\r\nconditions, to enable an animal to become modified by Natural Selection\r\nin harmony with such changed conditions; especially when we consider\r\nthat, to have produced the almost infinite modifications of organic\r\nbeings, this coincidence must have taken place an almost infinite number\r\nof times.\r\n\r\nNow, it seems to me that you have yourself led to this objection being\r\nmade, by so often stating the case too strongly against yourself. For\r\nexample, at the commencement of Chapter IV. you ask if it is \"improbable\r\nthat useful variations should sometimes occur in the course of thousands\r\nof generations\"; and a little further on you say, \"unless profitable\r\nvariations do occur, Natural Selection can do nothing.\" Now, such\r\nexpressions have given your opponents the advantage of assuming that\r\nfavourable variations are rare accidents, or may even for long periods\r\nnever occur at all, and thus Janet's argument would appear to many to\r\nhave great force. I think it would be better to do away with all such\r\nqualifying expressions, and constantly maintain (what I certainly\r\nbelieve to be the fact) that variations of every kind are always\r\noccurring in every part of every species, and therefore that favourable\r\nvariations are always ready when wanted. You have, I am sure, abundant\r\nmaterials to prove this; and it is, I believe, the grand fact that\r\nrenders modification and adaptation to conditions almost always\r\npossible. I would put the burthen of proof on my opponents to show that\r\nany one organ, structure, or faculty does not vary, even during one\r\ngeneration, among all the individuals of a species; and also to show any\r\nmode or way in which any such organ, etc., does not vary. I would ask\r\nthem to give any reason for supposing that any organ, etc., is ever\r\nabsolutely identical at any one time in all the individuals of a\r\nspecies, and if not then it is always varying, and there are always\r\nmaterials which, from the simple fact that \"the fittest survive,\"\r\nwill tend to the modification of the race into harmony with changed\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nI hope these remarks may be intelligible to you, and that you will be so\r\nkind as to let me know what you think of them.\r\n\r\nI have not heard for some time how you are getting on. I hope you are\r\nstill improving in health, and that you will now be able to get on with\r\nyour great work, for which so many thousands are looking with interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 191. TO A.R. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n(191/1. From \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 45.)\r\n\r\nDown, July 5th [1866].\r\n\r\nI have been much interested by your letter, which is as clear as\r\ndaylight. I fully agree with all that you say on the advantages of H.\r\nSpencer's excellent expression of \"the survival of the fittest.\"\r\nThis, however, had not occurred to me till reading your letter. It is,\r\nhowever, a great objection to this term that it cannot be used as a\r\nsubstantive governing a verb; and that this is a real objection I\r\ninfer from H. Spencer continually using the words Natural Selection. I\r\nformerly thought, probably in an exaggerated degree, that it was a great\r\nadvantage to bring into connection natural and artificial selection;\r\nthis indeed led me to use a term in common, and I still think it some\r\nadvantage. I wish I had received your letter two months ago, for I would\r\nhave worked in \"the survival,\" etc., often in the new edition of the\r\n\"Origin,\" which is now almost printed off, and of which I will of\r\ncourse send you a copy. I will use the term in my next book on domestic\r\nanimals, etc., from which, by the way, I plainly see that you expect\r\nMUCH too much. The term Natural Selection has now been so largely used\r\nabroad and at home that I doubt whether it could be given up, and with\r\nall its faults I should be sorry to see the attempt made. Whether it\r\nwill be rejected must now depend \"on the survival of the fittest.\" As in\r\ntime the term must grow intelligible the objections to its use will grow\r\nweaker and weaker. I doubt whether the use of any term would have made\r\nthe subject intelligible to some minds, clear as it is to others; for\r\ndo we not see even to the present day Malthus on Population absurdly\r\nmisunderstood? This reflection about Malthus has often comforted me when\r\nI have been vexed at this misstatement of my views. As for M. Janet, he\r\nis a metaphysician, and such gentlemen are so acute that I think they\r\noften misunderstand common folk. Your criticism on the double sense in\r\nwhich I have used Natural Selection is new to me and unanswerable;\r\nbut my blunder has done no harm, for I do not believe that any one,\r\nexcepting you, has ever observed it. Again, I agree that I have said too\r\nmuch about \"favourable variations,\" but I am inclined to think that you\r\nput the opposite side too strongly: if every part of every being varied,\r\nI do not think we should see the same end or object gained by such\r\nwonderfully diversified means.\r\n\r\nI hope you are enjoying the country, and are in good health, and are\r\nworking hard at your \"Malay Archipelago\" book, for I will always put\r\nthis wish in every note I write to you, as some good people always put\r\nin a text. My health keeps much the same, or rather improves, and I am\r\nable to work some hours daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 192. TO C. LYELL. Down, October 9th [1866].\r\n\r\nOne line to say that I have received your note and the proofs safely,\r\nand will read them with the greatest pleasure; but I am certain I shall\r\nnot be able to send any criticism on the astronomical chapter (192/1.\r\n\"Principles of Geology,\" by Sir Charles Lyell; Edition X., London, 1867.\r\nChapter XIII. deals with \"Vicissitudes in Climate how far influenced\r\nby Astronomical Causes.\"), as I am as ignorant as a pig on this head.\r\nI shall require some days to read what has been sent. I have just read\r\nChapter IX. (192/2. Chapter IX., \"Theory of the Progressive Development\r\nof Organic Life at Successive Geological Periods.\"), and like it\r\nextremely; it all seems to me very clear, cautious, and sagacious. You\r\ndo not allude to one very striking point enough, or at all--viz., the\r\nclasses having been formerly less differentiated than they now are;\r\nand this specialisation of classes must, we may conclude, fit them\r\nfor different general habits of life as well as the specialisation of\r\nparticular organs.\r\n\r\nPage 162 (192/3. On page 163 Lyell refers to the absence of Cetacea\r\nin Secondary rocks, and expresses the opinion that their absence \"is a\r\nnegative fact of great significance, which seems more than any other to\r\nrender it highly improbable that we shall ever find air-breathers of\r\nthe highest class in any of the Primary strata, or in any of the older\r\nmembers of the Secondary series.\") I rather demur to your argument from\r\nCetacea: as they are such greatly modified mammals, they ought to have\r\ncome in rather later in the series. You will think me rather impudent,\r\nbut the discussion at the end of Chapter IX. on man (192/4. Loc. cit.,\r\npages 167-73, \"Introduction of Man, to what extent a Change of the\r\nSystem.\"), who thinks so much of his fine self, seems to me too long, or\r\nrather superfluous, and too orthodox, except for the beneficed clergy.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 193. TO V. CARUS.\r\n\r\n(193/1. The following letter refers to the 4th edition of the \"Origin,\"\r\n1866, which was translated by Professor Carus, and formed the 3rd German\r\nedition. Carus continued to translate Darwin's books, and a strong\r\nbond of friendship grew up between author and translator (see \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" III., page 48). Nageli's pamphlet was first noticed in the 5th\r\nEnglish edition.)\r\n\r\nDown, November 21st, 1866.\r\n\r\n...With respect to a note on Nageli (193/2. \"Entstehung und Begriff der\r\nNaturhistorischen Art,\" an Address given before the Royal Academy of\r\nSciences at Munich, March 28th, 1865. See \"Life and Letters,\" III.,\r\npage 50, for Mr. Darwin's letter to the late Prof. Nageli.) I find on\r\nconsideration it would be too long; for so good a pamphlet ought to be\r\ndiscussed at full length or not at all. He makes a mistake in supposing\r\nthat I say that useful characters are always constant. His view about\r\ndistinct species converging and acquiring the same identical structure\r\nis by implication answered in the discussion which I have given on the\r\nendless diversity of means for gaining the same end.\r\n\r\nThe most important point, as it seems to me, in the pamphlet is that on\r\nthe morphological characters of plants, and I find I could not answer\r\nthis without going into much detail.\r\n\r\nThe answer would be, as it seems to me, that important morphological\r\ncharacters, such as the position of the ovules and the relative position\r\nof the stamens to the ovarium (hypogynous, perigynous, etc.) are\r\nsometimes variable in the same species, as I incidentally mention when\r\ntreating of the ray-florets in the Compositae and Umbelliferae; and I\r\ndo not see how Nageli could maintain that differences in such characters\r\nprove an inherent tendency towards perfection. I see that I have\r\nforgotten to say that you have my fullest consent to append any\r\ndiscussion which you may think fit to the new edition. As for myself I\r\ncannot believe in spontaneous generation, and though I expect that at\r\nsome future time the principle of life will be rendered intelligible, at\r\npresent it seems to me beyond the confines of science.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 194. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, December 22nd [1866?].\r\n\r\nI suppose that you have received Hackel's book (194/1. \"Generelle\r\nMorphologie,\" 1866.) some time ago, as I have done. Whenever you have\r\nhad time to read through some of it, enough to judge by, I shall be very\r\ncurious to hear your judgment. I have been able to read a page or two\r\nhere and there, and have been interested and instructed by parts. But my\r\nvague impression is that too much space is given to methodical details,\r\nand I can find hardly any facts or detailed new views. The number of new\r\nwords, to a man like myself, weak in his Greek, is something dreadful.\r\nHe seems to have a passion for defining, I daresay very well, and for\r\ncoining new words. From my very vague notions on the book, and from its\r\nimmense size, I should fear a translation was out of the question. I see\r\nhe often quotes both of us with praise. I am sure I should like the book\r\nmuch, if I could read it straight off instead of groaning and swearing\r\nat each sentence. I have not yet had time to read your Physiology\r\n(194/2. \"Lessons in Elementary Physiology,\" 1866.) book, except one\r\nchapter; but I have just re-read your book on \"Man's Place, etc.,\" and\r\nI think I admire it more this second time even than the first. I doubt\r\nwhether you will ever have time, but if ever you have, do read the\r\nchapter on hybridism in the new edition of the \"Origin\" (194/3. Fourth\r\nEdition (1866).), for I am very anxious to make you think less seriously\r\non that difficulty. I have improved the chapter a good deal, I think,\r\nand have come to more definite views. Asa Gray and Fritz Muller (the\r\nlatter especially) think that the new facts on illegitimate offspring of\r\ndimorphic plants, throw much indirect light on the subject. Now that\r\nI have worked up domestic animals, I am convinced of the truth of\r\nthe Pallasian (194/4. See Letter 80.) view of loss of sterility under\r\ndomestication, and this seems to me to explain much. But I had no\r\nintention, when I began this note, of running on at such length on\r\nhybridism; but you have been Objector-General on this head.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 195. TO T. RIVERS.\r\n\r\n(195/1. For another letter of Mr. Darwin's to him see \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" III., page 57.)\r\n\r\nDown, December 23rd [1866?].\r\n\r\nI do not know whether you will forgive a stranger addressing you.\r\nMy name may possibly be known to you. I am now writing a book on the\r\nvariation of animals and plants under domestication; and there is one\r\nlittle piece of information which it is more likely that you could give\r\nme than any man in the world, if you can spare half an hour from your\r\nprofessional labours, and are inclined to be so kind. I am collecting\r\nall accounts of what some call \"sports,\" that is, of what I shall call\r\n\"bud-variations,\" i.e. a moss-rose suddenly appearing on a Provence\r\nrose--a nectarine on a peach, etc. Now, what I want to know, and\r\nwhich is not likely to be recorded in print, is whether very slight\r\ndifferences, too slight to be worth propagating, thus appear suddenly\r\nby buds. As every one knows, in raising seedlings you may have every\r\ngradation from individuals identical with the parent, to slight\r\nvarieties, to strongly marked varieties. Now, does this occur with\r\nbuds or do only rather strongly marked varieties thus appear at rare\r\nintervals of time by buds? (195/2. Mr. Rivers could not give a decided\r\nanswer, but he did not remember to have seen slight bud-variations. The\r\nquestion is discussed in \"Variation under Domestication,\" Edition II.,\r\nVolume I., page 443.) I should be most grateful for information. I may\r\nadd that if you have observed in your enormous experience any remarkable\r\n\"bud-variations,\" and could spare time to inform me, and allow me to\r\nquote them on your authority, it would be the greatest favour. I\r\nfeel sure that these \"bud-variations\" are most interesting to any one\r\nendeavouring to make out what little can be made out on the obscure\r\nsubject of variation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 196. TO T. RIVERS. Down, January 7th [1867?].\r\n\r\nI thank you much for your letter and the parcel of shoots. The case\r\nof the yellow plum is a treasure, and is now safely recorded on your\r\nauthority in its proper place, in contrast with A. Knight's case of\r\nthe yellow magnum bonum sporting into red. (196/1. See \"Variation\r\nunder Domestication,\" Edition II., Volume I., page 399.) I could see no\r\ndifference in the shoots, except that those of the yellow were thicker,\r\nand I presume that this is merely accidental: as you do not mention it,\r\nI further presume that there are no further differences in leaves or\r\nflowers of the two plums. I am very glad to hear about the yellow ash,\r\nand that you yourself have seen the jessamine case. I must confess that\r\nI hardly fully believed in it; but now I do, and very surprising it is.\r\n\r\nIn an old French book, published in Amsterdam in 1786 (I think), there\r\nis an account, apparently authentic and attested by the writer as an\r\neye-witness, of hyacinth bulbs of two colours being cut in two and\r\ngrafted, and they sent up single stalks with differently coloured\r\nflowers on the two sides, and some flowers parti-coloured. I once\r\nthought of offering 5 pounds reward in the \"Cottage Gardener\" for such a\r\nplant; but perhaps it would seem too foolish. No instructions are given\r\nwhen to perform the operation; I have tried two or three times, and\r\nutterly failed. I find that I have a grand list of \"bud-variations,\" and\r\nto-morrow shall work up such cases as I have about rose-sports, which\r\nseem very numerous, and which I see you state to occur comparatively\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nWhen a person is very good-natured he gets much pestered--a discovery\r\nwhich I daresay you have made, or anyhow will soon make; for I do want\r\nvery much to know whether you have sown seed of any moss-roses, and\r\nwhether the seedlings were moss-roses. (196/2. Moss-roses can be raised\r\nfrom seed (\"Variation under Domestication,\" Edition II., Volume I., page\r\n405.) Has a common rose produced by SEED a moss-rose?\r\n\r\nIf any light comes to you about very slight changes in the buds, pray\r\nhave the kindness to illuminate me. I have cases of seven or eight\r\nvarieties of the peach which have produced by \"bud-variation\"\r\nnectarines, and yet only one single case (in France) of a peach\r\nproducing another closely similar peach (but later in ripening). How\r\nstrange it is that a great change in the peach should occur not rarely\r\nand slighter changes apparently very rarely! How strange that no case\r\nseems recorded of new apples or pears or apricots by \"bud-variation\"!\r\nHow ignorant we are! But with the many good observers now living our\r\nchildren's children will be less ignorant, and that is a comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 197. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, January 7th [1867].\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for your letter, which has told me exactly what I\r\nwanted to know. I shall give up all thoughts of trying to get the book\r\n(197/1. Hackel's \"Generelle Morphologie,\" 1866. See \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nIII., pages 67, 68.) translated, for I am well convinced that it would\r\nbe hopeless without too great an outlay. I much regret this, as I should\r\nthink the work would be useful, and I am sure it would be to me, as I\r\nshall never be able to wade through more than here and there a page of\r\nthe original. To all people I cannot but think that the number of new\r\nterms would be a great evil. I must write to him. I suppose you know\r\nhis address, but in case you do not, it is \"to care of Signor Nicolaus\r\nKrohn, Madeira.\" I have sent the MS. of my big book (197/2. \"The\r\nVariation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,\" 1868.), and\r\nhorridly, disgustingly big it will be, to the printers, but I do not\r\nsuppose it will be published, owing to Murray's idea on seasons, till\r\nnext November. I am thinking of a chapter on Man, as there has lately\r\nbeen so much said on Natural Selection in relation to man. I have not\r\nseen the Duke's (or Dukelet's? how can you speak so of a living real\r\nDuke?) book, but must get it from Mudie, as you say he attacks us.\r\n(197/3. \"The Reign of Law\" (1867), by the late Duke of Argyll. See \"Life\r\nand Letters,\" III., page 65.)\r\n\r\nP.S.--Nature never made species mutually sterile by selection, nor will\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 197. TO E. HACKEL. Down, January 8th [1867].\r\n\r\nI received some weeks ago your great work (198/1. \"Generelle\r\nMorphologie,\" 1866.); I have read several parts, but I am too poor a\r\nGerman scholar and the book is too large for me to read it all. I cannot\r\ntell you how much I regret this, for I am sure that nearly the whole\r\nwould interest me greatly, and I have already found several parts very\r\nuseful, such as the discussion on cells and on the different forms of\r\nreproduction. I feel sure, after considering the subject deliberately\r\nand after consulting with Huxley, that it would be hopeless to endeavour\r\nto get a publisher to print an English translation; the work is too\r\nprofound and too long for our English countrymen. The number of new\r\nterms would also, I am sure, tell much against its sale; and, indeed,\r\nI wish for my own sake that you had printed a glossary of all the\r\nnew terms which you use. I fully expect that your book will be highly\r\nsuccessful in Germany, and the manner in which you often refer to me in\r\nyour text, and your dedication and the title, I shall always look at as\r\none of the greatest honours conferred on me during my life. (198/2. As\r\nregards the dedication and title this seems a strong expression. The\r\ntitle is \"Generelle Morphologie der Organismen. Allgemeine Grundzuge\r\nder organischen Formen-Wissenschaft mechanisch begrundet durch die von\r\nCharles Darwin reformirte Descendenz-Theorie.\" The dedication of the\r\nsecond volume is \"Den Begrundern der Descendenz-Theorie, den denkenden\r\nNaturforschern, Charles Darwin, Wolfgang Goethe, Jean Lamarck widmet\r\ndiese Grundzuge der Allgemeinen Entwickelungsgeschichte in vorzuglicher\r\nVerehrung, der Verfasser.\")\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that you have had a prosperous expedition, and have met\r\nwith many new and interesting animals. If you have spare time I should\r\nmuch like to hear what you have been doing and observing. As for\r\nmyself, I have sent the MS. of my book on domestic animals, etc., to the\r\nprinters. It turns out to be much too large; it will not be published,\r\nI suppose, until next November. I find that we have discussed several\r\nof the same subjects, and I think we agree on most points fairly well.\r\nI have lately heard several times from Fritz Muller, but he seems now\r\nchiefly to be working on plants. I often think of your visit to this\r\nhouse, which I enjoyed extremely, and it will ever be to me a real\r\npleasure to remember our acquaintance. From what I heard in London I\r\nthink you made many friends there. Shall you return through England?\r\nIf so, and you can spare the time, we shall all be delighted to see you\r\nhere again.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 199. TO T. RIVERS. Down, January 11th [1867?].\r\n\r\nHow rich and valuable a letter you have most kindly sent me! The case\r\nof Baronne Prevost (199/1. See \"Variation under Domestication,\" Edition\r\nII., Volume I., page 406. Mr. Rivers had a new French rose with a\r\ndelicate smooth stem, pale glaucous leaves and striped flesh-coloured\r\nflowers; on branches thus characterised there appeared \"the famous old\r\nrose called 'Baronne Prevost,'\" with its stout thorny stem and uniform\r\nrich-coloured double flowers.), with its different shoots, foliage,\r\nspines, and flowers, will be grand to quote. I am extremely glad to hear\r\nabout the seedling moss-roses. That case of a seedling like a Scotch\r\nrose, unless you are sure that no Scotch rose grew near (and it is\r\nunlikely that you can remember), must, one would think, have been a\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nI have little compunction for being so troublesome--not more than a\r\ngrand Inquisitor has in torturing a heretic--for am I not doing a real\r\ngood public service in screwing crumbs of knowledge out of your wealth\r\nof information?\r\n\r\nP.S. Since the above was written I have read your paper in the\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle\": it is admirable, and will, I know, be a treasure\r\nto me. I did not at all know how strictly the character of so many\r\nflowers is inherited.\r\n\r\nOn my honour, when I began this note I had no thought of troubling you\r\nwith a question; but you mention one point so interesting, and which I\r\nhave had occasion to notice, that I must supplicate for a few more facts\r\nto quote on your authority. You say that you have one or two seedling\r\npeaches (199/2. \"On raising Peaches, Nectarines, and other Fruits from\r\nSeed.\" By Thomas Rivers, Sawbridgeworth.--\"Gard. Chron.\" 1866, page\r\n731.) approaching very nearly to thick-fleshed almonds (I know about A.\r\nKnight and the Italian hybrid cases). Now, did any almond grow near your\r\nmother peach? But especially I want to know whether you remember what\r\nshape the stone was, whether flattened like that of an almond; this,\r\nbotanically, seems the most important distinction. I earnestly wish to\r\nquote this. Was the flesh at all sweet?\r\n\r\nForgive if you can.\r\n\r\nHave you kept these seedling peaches? if you would give me next summer a\r\nfruit, I want to have it engraved.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 200. TO I. ANDERSON-HENRY. May 22nd [1867].\r\n\r\nYou are so kind as to offer to lend me Maillet's (200/1. For De Maillet\r\nsee Mr. Huxley's review on \"The Origin of Species\" in the \"Westminster\r\nReview,\" 1860, reprinted in \"Lay Sermons,\" 1870, page 314. De Maillet's\r\nevolutionary views were published after his death in 1748 under the name\r\nof Telliamed (De Maillet spelt backwards).) work, which I have often\r\nheard of, but never seen. I should like to have a look at it, and would\r\nreturn it to you in a short time. I am bound to read it, as my former\r\nfriend and present bitter enemy Owen generally ranks me and Maillet as a\r\npair of equal fools.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 201. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 4th [1867].\r\n\r\nYou have done me a very great service in sending me the pages of the\r\n\"Farmer.\" I do not know whether you wish it returned; but I will keep\r\nit unless I hear that you want it. Old I. Anderson-Henry passes a\r\nmagnificent but rather absurd eulogium on me; but the point of such\r\nextreme value in my eyes is Mr. Traill's (201/1. Mr. Traill's results\r\nare given at page 420 of \"Animals and Plants,\" Edition II., Volume I.\r\nIn the \"Life and Letters of G.J. Romanes,\" 1896, an interesting\r\ncorrespondence is published with Mr. Darwin on this subject. The plan\r\nof the experiments suggested to Romanes was to raise seedlings from\r\ngraft-hybrids: if the seminal offspring of plants hybridised by grafting\r\nshould show the hybrid character, it would be striking evidence in\r\nfavour of pangenesis. The experiment, however, did not succeed.)\r\nstatement that he made a mottled mongrel by cutting eyes through\r\nand joining two kinds of potatoes. (201/2. For an account of similar\r\nexperiments now in progress, see a \"Note on some Grafting Experiments\"\r\nby R. Biffen in the \"Annals of Botany,\" Volume XVI., page 174, 1902.) I\r\nhave written to him for full information, and then I will set to work\r\non a similar trial. It would prove, I think, to demonstration that\r\npropagation by buds and by the sexual elements are essentially the same\r\nprocess, as pangenesis in the most solemn manner declares to be the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 202. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, June 12th [1867?].\r\n\r\nWe come up on Saturday, the 15th, for a week. I want much to see you for\r\na short time to talk about my youngest boy and the School of Mines. I\r\nknow it is rather unreasonable, but you must let me come a little after\r\n10 o'clock on Sunday morning, the 16th. If in any way inconvenient, send\r\nme a line to \"6, Queen Anne Street W.,\"; but if I do not hear, I will\r\n(stomacho volente) call, but I will not stay very long and spoil your\r\nwhole morning as a holiday. Will you turn two or three times in your\r\nmind this question: what I called \"pangenesis\" means that each cell\r\nthrows off an atom of its contents or a gemmule, and that these\r\naggregated form the true ovule or bud, etc.? Now I want to know\r\nwhether I could not invent a better word. \"Cyttarogenesis\" (202/1. From\r\nkuttaros, a bee's-cell: cytogenesis would be a natural form of the word\r\nfrom kutos.)--i.e. cell-genesis--is more true and expressive, but long.\r\n\"Atomogenesis\" sounds rather better, I think, but an \"atom\" is an object\r\nwhich cannot be divided; and the term might refer to the origin of\r\natoms of inorganic matter. I believe I like \"pangenesis\" best, though\r\nso indefinite; and though my wife says it sounds wicked, like pantheism;\r\nbut I am so familiar now with this word, that I cannot judge. I\r\nsupplicate you to help me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 203. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, October, 12th and 13th [1867].\r\n\r\nI ordered the journal (203/1. \"Quarterly Journal of Science,\" October,\r\n1867, page 472. A review of the Duke of Argyll's \"Reign of Law.\") a long\r\ntime ago, but by some oversight received it only yesterday, and read it.\r\nYou will think my praise not worth having, from being so indiscriminate;\r\nbut if I am to speak the truth, I must say I admire every word. You have\r\njust touched on the points which I particularly wished to see noticed.\r\nI am glad you had the courage to take up Angraecum (203/2. Angraecum\r\nsesquipedale, a Madagascan orchid, with a whiplike nectary, 11 to\r\n12 inches in length, which, according to Darwin (\"Fertilisation of\r\nOrchids,\" Edition II., page 163), is adapted to the visits of a moth\r\nwith a proboscis of corresponding length. He points out that there is no\r\ndifficulty in believing in the existence of such a moth as F. Muller\r\nhas described (\"Nature,\" 1873, page 223)--a Brazilian sphinx-moth with a\r\ntrunk of 10 to 11 inches in length. Moreover, Forbes has given evidence\r\nto show that such an insect does exist in Madagascar (\"Nature,\" VIII.,\r\n1873, page 121). The case of Angraecum was put forward by the Duke\r\nof Argyll as being necessarily due to the personal contrivance of the\r\nDeity. Mr. Wallace (page 476) shows that both proboscis and nectary\r\nmight be increased in length by means of Natural Selection. It may be\r\nadded that Hermann Muller has shown good grounds for believing that\r\nmutual specialisation of this kind is beneficial both to insect and\r\nplant.) after the Duke's attack; for I believe the principle in this\r\ncase may be widely applied. I like the figure, but I wish the artist had\r\ndrawn a better sphinx. With respect to beauty, your remarks on hideous\r\nobjects and on flowers not being made beautiful except when of practical\r\nuse to them, strike me as very good. On this one point of beauty I\r\ncan hardly think that the Duke was quite candid. I have used in the\r\nconcluding paragraph of my present book precisely the same argument as\r\nyou have, even bringing in the bull-dog (203/3. \"Variation of Animals\r\nand Plants,\" Edition I., Volume II., page 431: \"Did He cause the frame\r\nand mental qualities of the dog to vary in order that a breed might be\r\nformed of indomitable ferocity, with jaws fitted to pin down the bull\r\nfor man's brutal sport?\"), with respect to variations not having been\r\nspecially ordained. Your metaphor of the river (203/4. See Wallace,\r\nop. cit., pages 477-8. He imagines an observer examining a great\r\nriver-system, and finding everywhere adaptations which reveal the design\r\nof the Creator. \"He would see special adaptation to the wants of man\r\nin broad, quiet, navigable rivers, through fertile alluvial plains that\r\nwould support a large population, while the rocky streams and mountain\r\ntorrents were confined to those sterile regions suitable only for\r\na small population of shepherds and herdsmen.') is new to me, and\r\nadmirable; but your other metaphor, in which you compare classification\r\nand complex machines, does not seem to me quite appropriate, though\r\nI cannot point out what seems deficient. The point which seems to\r\nme strong is that all naturalists admit that there is a natural\r\nclassification, and it is this which descent explains. I wish you had\r\ninsisted a little more against the \"North British\" (203/5. At page 485\r\nMr. Wallace deals with Fleeming Jenkin's review in the \"North British\r\nReview,\" 1867. The review strives to show that there are strict limits\r\nto variation, since the most rigorous and long-continued selection\r\ndoes not indefinitely increase such a quality as the fleetness of a\r\nracehorse. On this Mr. Wallace remarks that \"this argument fails to meet\r\nthe real question,\" which is, not whether indefinite change is possible,\r\n\"but whether such differences as do occur in nature could have been\r\nproduced by the accumulation of variations by selection.\") on the\r\nreviewer assuming that each variation which appears is a strongly marked\r\none; though by implication you have made this very plain. Nothing in\r\nyour whole article has struck me more than your view with respect to the\r\nlimit of fleetness in the racehorse and other such cases: I shall try\r\nand quote you on this head in the proof of my concluding chapter. I\r\nquite missed this explanation, though in the case of wheat I hit upon\r\nsomething analogous. I am glad you praise the Duke's book, for I was\r\nmuch struck with it. The part about flight seemed to me at first very\r\ngood; but as the wing is articulated by a ball-and-socket joint, I\r\nsuspect the Duke would find it very difficult to give any reason against\r\nthe belief that the wing strikes the air more or less obliquely. I have\r\nbeen very glad to see your article and the drawing of the butterfly\r\nin \"Science Gossip.\" By the way, I cannot but think that you push\r\nprotection too far in some cases, as with the stripes on the tiger. I\r\nhave also this morning read an excellent abstract in the \"Gardeners'\r\nChronicle\" of your paper on nests. (203/6. An abstract of a paper on\r\n\"Birds' Nests and Plumage,\" read before the British Association: see\r\n\"Gard. Chron.\" 1867, page 1047.) I was not by any means fully converted\r\nby your letter, but I think now I am so; and I hope it will be published\r\nsomewhere in extenso. It strikes me as a capital generalisation, and\r\nappears to me even more original than it did at first...\r\n\r\nI have finished Volume I. of my book [\"Variation of Animals and\r\nPlants\"], and I hope the whole will be out by the end of November. If\r\nyou have the patience to read it through, which is very doubtful, you\r\nwill find, I think, a large accumulation of facts which will be of\r\nservice to you in future papers; and they could not be put to better\r\nuse, for you certainly are a master in the noble art of reasoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 204. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, October 3rd [no date].\r\n\r\nI know you have no time for speculative correspondence; and I did not\r\nin the least expect an answer to my last. But I am very glad to have\r\nhad it, for in my eclectic work the opinions of the few good men are of\r\ngreat value to me.\r\n\r\nI knew, of course, of the Cuvierian view of classification (204/1.\r\nCuvier proved that \"animals cannot be arranged in a single series, but\r\nthat there are several distinct plans of organisation to be observed\r\namong them, no one of which, in its highest and most complicated\r\nmodification, leads to any of the others\" (Huxley's \"Darwiniana,\" page\r\n215).); but I think that most naturalists look for something further,\r\nand search for \"the natural system,\"--\"for the plan on which the Creator\r\nhas worked,\" etc., etc. It is this further element which I believe to be\r\nsimply genealogical.\r\n\r\nBut I should be very glad to have your answer (either when we meet or by\r\nnote) to the following case, taken by itself, and not allowing yourself\r\nto look any further than to the point in question. Grant all races of\r\nman descended from one race--grant that all the structure of each race\r\nof man were perfectly known--grant that a perfect table of the descent\r\nof each race was perfectly known--grant all this, and then do you not\r\nthink that most would prefer as the best classification, a genealogical\r\none, even if it did occasionally put one race not quite so near to\r\nanother, as it would have stood, if collocated by structure alone?\r\nGenerally, we may safely presume, that the resemblance of races and\r\ntheir pedigrees would go together.\r\n\r\nI should like to hear what you would say on this purely theoretical\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIt might be asked why is development so all-potent in classification,\r\nas I fully admit it is? I believe it is because it depends on, and best\r\nbetrays, genealogical descent; but this is too large a point to enter\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 205. TO C. LYELL. Down, December 7th [1867].\r\n\r\nI send by this post the article in the Victorian Institute with respect\r\nto frogs' spawn. If you remember in your boyhood having ever tried to\r\ntake a small portion out of the water, you will remember that it is most\r\ndifficult. I believe all the birds in the world might alight every day\r\non the spawn of batrachians, and never transport a single ovum. With\r\nrespect to the young of molluscs, undoubtedly if the bird to which they\r\nwere attached alighted on the sea, they would be instantly killed; but\r\na land-bird would, I should think, never alight except under dire\r\nnecessity from fatigue. This, however, has been observed near Heligoland\r\n(205/1. Instances are recorded by Gatke in his \"Heligoland as an\r\nOrnithological Observatory\" (translated by Rudolph Rosenstock,\r\nEdinburgh, 1895) of land-birds, such as thrushes, buntings, finches,\r\netc., resting for a short time on the surface of the water. The\r\nauthor describes observations made by himself about two miles west of\r\nHeligoland (page 129).); and land-birds, after resting for a time on the\r\ntranquil sea, have been seen to rise and continue their flight. I cannot\r\ngive you the reference about Heligoland without much searching. This\r\nalighting on the sea may aid you in your unexpected difficulty of the\r\ntoo-easy diffusion of land-molluscs by the agency of birds. I much\r\nenjoyed my morning's talk with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 206. TO F. HILDEBRAND. Down, January 5th [1868].\r\n\r\nI thank you for your letter, which has quite delighted me. I sincerely\r\ncongratulate you on your success in making a graft-hybrid (206/1. Prof.\r\nHildebrand's paper is in the \"Bot. Zeitung,\" 1868: the substance is\r\ngiven in \"Variation of Animals and Plants,\" Edition II., Volume I., page\r\n420.), for I believe it to be a most important observation. I trust that\r\nyou will publish full details on this subject and on the direct action\r\nof pollen (206/2. See Prof. Hildebrand, \"Bot. Zeitung,\" 1868, and\r\n\"Variation of Animals and Plants,\" Edition II., Volume I., page 430.\r\nA yellow-grained maize was fertilised with pollen from a brown-grained\r\none; the result was that ears were produced bearing both yellow and\r\ndark-coloured grains.): I hope that you will be so kind as to send me a\r\ncopy of your paper. If I had succeeded in making a graft-hybrid of the\r\npotato, I had intended to raise seedlings from the graft-hybrid and\r\nfrom the two parent-forms (excluding insects) and carefully compare the\r\noffspring. This, however, would be difficult on account of the sterility\r\nand variability of the potato. When in the course of a few months you\r\nreceive my second volume (206/3. This sentence may be paraphrased--\"When\r\nyou receive my book and read the second volume.\"), you will see why\r\nI think these two subjects so important. They have led me to form\r\na hypothesis on the various forms of reproduction, development,\r\ninheritance, etc., which hypothesis, I believe, will ultimately be\r\naccepted, though how it will be now received I am very doubtful.\r\n\r\nOnce again I congratulate you on your success.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 207. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 6th [1868].\r\n\r\nMany thanks about names of plants, synonyms, and male flowers--all that\r\nI wanted.\r\n\r\nI have been glad to see Watson's letter, and am sorry he is a renegade\r\nabout Natural Selection. It is, as you say, characteristic, with the\r\nfinal fling at you.\r\n\r\nHis difficulty about the difference between the two genera of St. Helena\r\nUmbellifers is exactly the same as what Nageli has urged in an able\r\npamphlet (207/1. \"Ueber Entstehung und Begriff der naturhist. Art.\"\r\n\"Sitz. der K. Bayer. Akad. Der Wiss. zu Munchen,\" 1865. Some of Nageli's\r\npoints are discussed in the \"Origin,\" Edition V., page 151.), and who\r\nin consequence maintains that there is some unknown innate tendency to\r\nprogression in all organisms. I said in a letter to him that of course I\r\ncould not in the least explain such cases; but that they did not seem\r\nto me of overwhelming force, as long as we are quite ignorant of the\r\nmeaning of such structures, whether they are of any service to the\r\nplants, or inevitable consequences of modifications in other parts.\r\n\r\nI cannot understand what Watson means by the \"counter-balance in nature\"\r\nto divergent variation. There is the counterbalance of crossing,\r\nof which my present work daily leads me to see more and more the\r\nefficiency; but I suppose he means something very different. Further, I\r\nbelieve variation to be divergent solely because diversified forms can\r\nbest subsist. But you will think me a bore.\r\n\r\nI enclose half a letter from F. Muller (which please return) for the\r\nchance of your liking to see it; though I have doubted much about\r\nsending it, as you are so overworked. I imagine the Solanum-like flower\r\nis curious.\r\n\r\nI heard yesterday to my joy that Dr. Hildebrand has been experimenting\r\non the direct action of pollen on the mother-plant with success. He has\r\nalso succeeded in making a true graft-hybrid between two varieties of\r\npotatoes, in which I failed. I look at this as splendid for pangenesis,\r\nas being strong evidence that bud-reproduction and seminal reproduction\r\ndo not essentially differ.\r\n\r\nMy book is horribly delayed, owing to the accursed index-maker. (207/2.\r\nDarwin thoroughly appreciated the good work put into the index of \"The\r\nVariation of Animals and Plants.\") I have almost forgotten it!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 208. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, January 30th [1868].\r\n\r\nMost sincere thanks for your kind congratulations. I never received a\r\nnote from you in my life without pleasure; but whether this will be so\r\nafter you have read pangenesis (208/1. In Volume II. of \"Animals and\r\nPlants, 1868.), I am very doubtful. Oh Lord, what a blowing up I may\r\nreceive! I write now partly to say that you must not think of looking\r\nat my book till the summer, when I hope you will read pangenesis, for I\r\ncare for your opinion on such a subject more than for that of any other\r\nman in Europe. You are so terribly sharp-sighted and so confoundedly\r\nhonest! But to the day of my death I will always maintain that you have\r\nbeen too sharp-sighted on hybridism; and the chapter on the subject in\r\nmy book I should like you to read: not that, as I fear, it will produce\r\nany good effect, and be hanged to you.\r\n\r\nI rejoice that your children are all pretty well. Give Mrs. Huxley the\r\nenclosed (208/2. Queries on Expression.), and ask her to look out when\r\none of her children is struggling and just going to burst out crying. A\r\ndear young lady near here plagued a very young child for my sake, till\r\nit cried, and saw the eyebrows for a second or two beautifully oblique,\r\njust before the torrent of tears began.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy of all our friends about George's success (it is the young\r\nHerald) (208/3. His son George was Second Wrangler in 1868; as a boy\r\nhe was an enthusiast in heraldry.) has been a wonderful pleasure to\r\nus. George has not slaved himself, which makes his success the more\r\nsatisfactory. Farewell, my dear Huxley, and do not kill yourself with\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n(209/1. The following group of letters deals with the problem of the\r\ncauses of the sterility of hybrids. Mr. Darwin's final view is given in\r\nthe \"Origin,\" sixth edition (page 384, edition 1900). He acknowledges\r\nthat it would be advantageous to two incipient species, if by\r\nphysiological isolation due to mutual sterility, they could be kept from\r\nblending: but he continues, \"After mature reflection it seems to me\r\nthat this could not have been effected through Natural Selection.\" And\r\nfinally he concludes (page 386):--\r\n\r\n\"But it would be superfluous to discuss this question in detail; for\r\nwith plants we have conclusive evidence that the sterility of crossed\r\nspecies must be due to some principle quite independent of Natural\r\nSelection. Both Gartner and Kolreuter have proved that in genera\r\nincluding numerous species, a series can be formed from species which\r\nwhen crossed yield fewer and fewer seeds, to species which never produce\r\na single seed, but yet are affected by the pollen of certain other\r\nspecies, for the germen swells. It is here manifestly impossible to\r\nselect the more sterile individuals, which have already ceased to\r\nyield seeds; so that this acme of sterility, when the germen alone is\r\naffected, cannot have been gained through selection; and from the laws\r\ngoverning the various grades of sterility being so uniform throughout\r\nthe animal and vegetable kingdoms, we may infer that the cause, whatever\r\nit may be, is the same or nearly the same in all cases.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace, on the other hand, still adheres to his view: see his\r\n\"Darwinism,\" 1889, page 174, and for a more recent statement see page\r\n292, note 1, Letter 211, and page 299.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of 1868 began with a letter from Mr. Wallace, written\r\ntowards the end of February, giving his opinion on the \"Variation of\r\nAnimals and Plants;\" the discussion on the sterility of hybrids is at\r\npage 185, Volume II., of the first edition.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 209. A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN. February 1868.\r\n\r\nThe only parts I have yet met with where I somewhat differ from your\r\nviews, are in the chapter on the causes of variability, in which I think\r\nseveral of your arguments are unsound: but this is too long a subject\r\nto go into now. Also, I do not see your objection to sterility between\r\nallied species having been aided by Natural Selection. It appears to me\r\nthat, given a differentiation of a species into two forms, each of which\r\nwas adapted to a special sphere of existence, every slight degree of\r\nsterility would be a positive advantage, not to the individuals who\r\nwere sterile, but to each form. If you work it out, and suppose the\r\ntwo incipient species a...b to be divided into two groups, one of which\r\ncontains those which are fertile when the two are crossed, the other\r\nbeing slightly sterile, you will find that the latter will certainly\r\nsupplant the former in the struggle for existence; remembering that you\r\nhave shown that in such a cross the offspring would be more vigorous\r\nthan the pure breed, and therefore would certainly soon supplant them,\r\nand as these would not be so well adapted to any special sphere of\r\nexistence as the pure species a and b, they would certainly in their\r\nturn give way to a and b.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 210. TO A.R. WALLACE. February 27th [1868].\r\n\r\nI shall be very glad to hear, at some future day, your criticisms on\r\nthe \"causes of variability.\" Indeed, I feel sure that I am right about\r\nsterility and Natural Selection. Two of my grown-up children who are\r\nacute reasoners have two or three times at intervals tried to prove\r\nme wrong; and when your letter came they had another try, but ended\r\nby coming back to my side. I do not quite understand your case, and\r\nwe think that a word or two is misplaced. I wish some time you would\r\nconsider the case under the following point of view. If sterility is\r\ncaused or accumulated through Natural Selection, then, as every degree\r\nexists up to absolute barrenness, Natural Selection must have the power\r\nof increasing it. Now take two species A and B, and assume that they\r\nare (by any means) half-sterile, i.e., produce half the full number of\r\noffspring. Now try and make (by Natural Selection) A and B absolutely\r\nsterile when crossed, and you will find how difficult it is. I\r\ngrant, indeed it is certain, that the degree of the sterility of the\r\nindividuals of A and B will vary; but any such extra-sterile individuals\r\nof, we will say A, if they should hereafter breed with other individuals\r\nof A, will bequeath no advantage to their progeny, by which these\r\nfamilies will tend to increase in number over other families of A, which\r\nare not more sterile when crossed with B. But I do not know that I\r\nhave made this any clearer than in the chapter in my book. It is a most\r\ndifficult bit of reasoning, which I have gone over and over again on\r\npaper with diagrams. (210/1. This letter appeared in \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nIII., page 80.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 211. A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN. March 1st, 1868.\r\n\r\nI beg to enclose what appears to me a demonstration on your own\r\nprinciples, that Natural Selection could produce sterility of hybrids.\r\nIf it does not convince you, I shall be glad if you will point out\r\nwhere the fallacy lies. I have taken the two cases of a slight sterility\r\novercoming perfect fertility, and of a perfect sterility overcoming a\r\npartial fertility,--the beginning and end of the process. You admit that\r\nvariations in fertility and sterility occur, and I think you will also\r\nadmit that if I demonstrate that a considerable amount of sterility\r\nwould be advantageous to a variety, that is sufficient proof that the\r\nslightest variation in that direction would be useful also, and would go\r\non accumulating.\r\n\r\n1. Let there be a species which has varied into two forms, each adapted\r\nto existing conditions (211/1. \"Existing conditions,\" means of course\r\nnew conditions which have now come into existence. And the \"two\" being\r\nboth better adapted than the parent form, means that they are better\r\nadapted each to a special environment in the same area--as one to damp,\r\nanother to dry places; one to woods, another to open grounds, etc.,\r\netc., as Darwin had already explained. A.R.W. (1899).) better than the\r\nparent form, which they supplant.\r\n\r\n2. If these two forms, which are supposed to co-exist in the same\r\ndistrict, do not intercross, Natural Selection will accumulate\r\nfavourable variations, till they become sufficiently well adapted to\r\ntheir conditions of life and form two allied species.\r\n\r\n3. But if these two forms freely intercross with each other and produce\r\nhybrids which are also quite fertile inter se, then the formation of\r\nthe two distinct races or species will be retarded or perhaps entirely\r\nprevented; for the offspring of the crossed unions will be more vigorous\r\nowing to the cross, although less adapted to their conditions of\r\nlife than either of the pure breeds. (211/2. After \"pure breeds,\" add\r\n\"because less specialised.\" A.R.W. (1899).)\r\n\r\n4. Now let a partial sterility of some individuals of these two forms\r\narise when they intercross; and as this would probably be due to some\r\nspecial conditions of life, we may fairly suppose it to arise in some\r\ndefinite portion of the area occupied by the two forms.\r\n\r\n5. The result is that in this area hybrids will not increase so rapidly\r\nas before; and as by the terms of the problem the two pure forms are\r\nbetter suited to the conditions of life than the hybrids, they will tend\r\nto supplant the latter altogether whenever the struggle for existence\r\nbecomes severe.\r\n\r\n6. We may fairly suppose, also, that as soon as any sterility appears\r\nunder natural conditions, it will be accompanied by some disinclination\r\nto cross-unions; and this will further diminish the production of\r\nhybrids.\r\n\r\n7. In the other part of the area, however, where hybridism occurs\r\nunchecked, hybrids of various degrees will soon far outnumber the parent\r\nor pure form.\r\n\r\n8. The first result, then, of a partial sterility of crosses appearing\r\nin one part of the area occupied by the two forms, will be, that the\r\nGREAT MAJORITY of the individuals will there consist of the pure forms\r\nonly, while in the rest of the area these will be in a minority,--which\r\nis the same as saying, that the new sterile or physiological variety of\r\nthe two forms will be better suited to the conditions of existence than\r\nthe remaining portion which has not varied physiologically.\r\n\r\n9. But when the struggle for existence becomes severe, that variety\r\nwhich is best adapted to the conditions of existence always supplants\r\nthat which is imperfectly adapted; therefore by Natural Selection the\r\nsterile varieties of the two forms will become established as the only\r\nones.\r\n\r\n10. Now let a fresh series of variations in the amount of sterility and\r\nin the disinclination to crossed unions occur,--also in certain parts\r\nof the area: exactly the same result must recur, and the progeny of this\r\nnew physiological variety again in time occupy the whole area.\r\n\r\n11. There is yet another consideration that supports this view. It seems\r\nprobable that the variations in amount of sterility would to some extent\r\nconcur with and perhaps depend upon the structural variations; so that\r\njust in proportion as the two forms diverged and became better adapted\r\nto the conditions of existence, their sterility would increase. If this\r\nwere the case, then Natural Selection would act with double strength,\r\nand those varieties which were better adapted to survive both\r\nstructurally and physiologically, would certainly do so. (211/3. The\r\npreceding eleven paragraphs are substantially but not verbally identical\r\nwith the statement of the argument in Mr. Wallace's \"Darwinism,\" 1889.\r\nPages 179, 180, note 1.)\r\n\r\n12. Let us now consider the more difficult case of two allied species\r\nA, B, in the same area, half the individuals of each (As, Bs) being\r\nabsolutely sterile, the other half (Af, Bf) being partially fertile:\r\nwill As, Bs ultimately exterminate Af, Bf?\r\n\r\n13. To avoid complication, it must be granted, that between As and Bs\r\nno cross-unions take place, while between Af and Bf cross-unions are as\r\nfrequent as direct unions, though much less fertile. We must also leave\r\nout of consideration crosses between As and Af, Bs and Bf, with their\r\nvarious approaches to sterility, as I believe they will not affect the\r\nfinal result, although they will greatly complicate the problem.\r\n\r\n14. In the first generation there will result: 1st, The pure progeny of\r\nAs and Bs; 2nd, The pure progeny of Af and of Bf; and 3rd, The hybrid\r\nprogeny of Af, Bf.\r\n\r\n15. Supposing that, in ordinary years, the increased constitutional\r\nvigour of the hybrids exactly counterbalances their imperfect\r\nadaptations to conditions, there will be in the second generation,\r\nbesides these three classes, hybrids of the second degree between the\r\nfirst hybrids and Af and Bf respectively. In succeeding generations\r\nthere will be hybrids of all degrees, varying between the first hybrids\r\nand the almost pure types of Af and Bf.\r\n\r\n16. Now, if at first the number of individuals of As, Bs, Af and Bf\r\nwere equal, and year after year the total number continues stationary,\r\nI think it can be proved that, while half will be the pure progeny of As\r\nand Bs, the other half will become more and more hybridised, until the\r\nwhole will be hybrids of various degrees.\r\n\r\n17. Now, this hybrid and somewhat intermediate race cannot be so well\r\nadapted to the conditions of life as the two pure species, which have\r\nbeen formed by the minute adaptation to conditions through Natural\r\nSelection; therefore, in a severe struggle for existence, the hybrids\r\nmust succumb, especially as, by hypothesis, their fertility would not be\r\nso great as that of the two pure species.\r\n\r\n18. If we were to take into consideration the unions of As with Af and\r\nBs with Bf, the results would become very complicated, but it must still\r\nlead to there being a number of pure forms entirely derived from As and\r\nBs, and of hybrid forms mainly derived from Af and Bf; and the result of\r\nthe struggle of these two sets of individuals cannot be doubtful.\r\n\r\n19. If these arguments are sound, it follows that sterility may\r\nbe accumulated and increased, and finally made complete by Natural\r\nSelection, whether the sterile varieties originate together in a\r\ndefinite portion of the area occupied by the two species, or occur\r\nscattered over the whole area. (211/4. The first part of this discussion\r\nshould be considered alone, as it is both more simple and more\r\nimportant. I now believe that the utility, and therefore the cause of\r\nsterility between species, is during the process of differentiation.\r\nWhen species are fully formed, the occasional occurrence of hybrids\r\nis of comparatively small importance, and can never be a danger to the\r\nexistence of the species. A.R.W. (1899).)\r\n\r\nP.S.--In answer to the objection as to the unequal sterility of\r\nreciprocal crosses (\"Variation, etc.\" Volume II., page 186) I\r\nreply that, as far as it went, the sterility of one cross would be\r\nadvantageous even if the other cross was fertile: and just as characters\r\nnow co-ordinated may have been separately accumulated by Natural\r\nSelection, so the reciprocal crosses may have become sterile one at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 212.

My second son,\r\nthe mathematician, thinks that you have omitted one almost inevitable\r\ndeduction which apparently would modify the result.

Hurstpierpoint, March, 24th\r\n[1868].\r\n\r\nI return your son's notes with my notes on them. Without going into any\r\ndetails, is not this a strong general argument?\r\n\r\n1. A species varies occasionally in two directions, but owing to their\r\nfree intercrossing the varieties never increase.\r\n\r\n2. A change of conditions occurs which threatens the existence of the\r\nspecies; but the two varieties are adapted to the changing conditions,\r\nand if accumulated will form two new species adapted to the new\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n3. Free crossing, however, renders this impossible, and so the species\r\nis in danger of extinction.\r\n\r\n4. If sterility would be induced, then the pure races would increase\r\nmore rapidly, and replace the old species.\r\n\r\n5. It is admitted that partial sterility between varieties does\r\noccasionally occur. It is admitted [that] the degree of this sterility\r\nvaries; is it not probable that Natural Selection can accumulate these\r\nvariations, and thus save the species? If Natural Selection can NOT do\r\nthis, how do species ever arise, except when a variety is isolated?\r\n\r\nClosely allied species in distinct countries being sterile is no\r\ndifficulty; for either they diverged from a common ancestor in contact,\r\nand Natural Selection increased the sterility, or they were isolated,\r\nand have varied since: in which case they have been for ages influenced\r\nby distinct conditions which may well produce sterility.\r\n\r\nIf the difficulty of grafting was as great as the difficulty of\r\ncrossing, and as regular, I admit it would be a most serious objection.\r\nBut it is not. I believe many distinct species can be grafted, while\r\nothers less distinct cannot. The regularity with which natural species\r\nare sterile together, even when very much alike, I think is an argument\r\nin favour of the sterility having been generally produced by Natural\r\nSelection for the good of the species.\r\n\r\nThe other difficulty, of unequal sterility of reciprocal crosses, seems\r\nnone to me; for it is a step to more complete sterility, and as such\r\nwould be increased by selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 213. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, April 6th [1868].\r\n\r\nI have been considering the terrible problem. Let me first say that\r\nno man could have more earnestly wished for the success of Natural\r\nSelection in regard to sterility than I did; and when I considered a\r\ngeneral statement (as in your last note) I always felt sure it could be\r\nworked out, but always failed in detail. The cause being, as I\r\nbelieve, that Natural Selection cannot effect what is not good for the\r\nindividual, including in this term a social community. It would take a\r\nvolume to discuss all the points, and nothing is so humiliating to me\r\nas to agree with a man like you (or Hooker) on the premises and disagree\r\nabout the result.\r\n\r\nI agree with my son's argument and not with the rejoinder. The cause of\r\nour difference, I think, is that I look at the number of offspring as an\r\nimportant element (all circumstances remaining the same) in keeping up\r\nthe average number of individuals within any area. I do not believe that\r\nthe amount of food by any means is the sole determining cause of number.\r\nLessened fertility is equivalent to a new source of destruction. I\r\nbelieve if in one district a species produced from any cause fewer\r\nyoung, the deficiency would be supplied from surrounding districts. This\r\napplies to your Paragraph 5. (213/1. See Letter 211.) If the species\r\nproduced fewer young from any cause in every district, it would become\r\nextinct unless its fertility were augmented through Natural Selection\r\n(see H. Spencer).\r\n\r\nI demur to probability and almost to possibility of Paragraph 1., as\r\nyou start with two forms within the same area, which are not mutually\r\nsterile, and which yet have supplanted the parent-form.\r\n\r\n(Paragraph 6.) I know of no ghost of a fact supporting belief that\r\ndisinclination to cross accompanies sterility. It cannot hold with\r\nplants, or the lower fixed aquatic animals. I saw clearly what an\r\nimmense aid this would be, but gave it up. Disinclination to cross seems\r\nto have been independently acquired, probably by Natural Selection; and\r\nI do not see why it would not have sufficed to have prevented incipient\r\nspecies from blending to have simply increased sexual disinclination to\r\ncross.\r\n\r\n(Paragraph 11.) I demur to a certain extent to amount of sterility and\r\nstructural dissimilarity necessarily going together, except indirectly\r\nand by no means strictly. Look at vars. of pigeons, fowls, and cabbages.\r\n\r\nI overlooked the advantage of the half-sterility of reciprocal crosses;\r\nyet, perhaps from novelty, I do not feel inclined to admit probability\r\nof Natural Selection having done its work so queerly.\r\n\r\nI will not discuss the second case of utter sterility, but your\r\nassumptions in Paragraph 13 seem to me much too complicated. I cannot\r\nbelieve so universal an attribute as utter sterility between remote\r\nspecies was acquired in so complex a manner. I do not agree with\r\nyour rejoinder on grafting: I fully admit that it is not so closely\r\nrestricted as crossing, but this does not seem to me to weaken the case\r\nas one of analogy. The incapacity of grafting is likewise an invariable\r\nattribute of plants sufficiently remote from each other, and sometimes\r\nof plants pretty closely allied.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of increasing the sterility through Natural Selection of\r\ntwo already sterile species seems to me best brought home by considering\r\nan actual case. The cowslip and primrose are moderately sterile, yet\r\noccasionally produce hybrids. Now these hybrids, two or three or a\r\ndozen in a whole parish, occupy ground which might have been occupied\r\nby either pure species, and no doubt the latter suffer to this small\r\nextent. But can you conceive that any individual plants of the primrose\r\nand cowslip which happened to be mutually rather more sterile (i.e.\r\nwhich, when crossed, yielded a few less seed) than usual, would profit\r\nto such a degree as to increase in number to the ultimate exclusion of\r\nthe present primrose and cowslip? I cannot.\r\n\r\nMy son, I am sorry to say, cannot see the full force of your rejoinder\r\nin regard to second head of continually augmented sterility. You speak\r\nin this rejoinder, and in Paragraph 5, of all the individuals becoming\r\nin some slight degree sterile in certain districts: if you were to admit\r\nthat by continued exposure to these same conditions the sterility would\r\ninevitably increase, there would be no need of Natural Selection. But\r\nI suspect that the sterility is not caused so much by any particular\r\nconditions as by long habituation to conditions of any kind. To speak\r\naccording to pangenesis, the gemmules of hybrids are not injured, for\r\nhybrids propagate freely by buds; but their reproductive organs are\r\nsomehow affected, so that they cannot accumulate the proper gemmules,\r\nin nearly the same manner as the reproductive organs of a pure species\r\nbecome affected when exposed to unnatural conditions.\r\n\r\nThis is a very ill-expressed and ill-written letter. Do not answer it,\r\nunless the spirit urges you. Life is too short for so long a discussion.\r\nWe shall, I greatly fear, never agree.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 214. A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN. Hurstpierpoint, [April?]\r\n8th, 1868.\r\n\r\nI am sorry you should have given yourself the trouble to answer my ideas\r\non sterility. If you are not convinced, I have little doubt but that I\r\nam wrong; and, in fact, I was only half convinced by my own arguments,\r\nand I now think there is about an even chance that Natural Selection may\r\nor may not be able to accumulate sterility. If my first proposition is\r\nmodified to the existence of a species and a variety in the same area,\r\nit will do just as well for my argument. Such certainly do exist. They\r\nare fertile together, and yet each maintains itself tolerably distinct.\r\nHow can this be, if there is no disinclination to crossing?\r\n\r\nMy belief certainly is that number of offspring is not so important\r\nan element in keeping up population of a species as supply of food and\r\nother favourable conditions; because the numbers of a species constantly\r\nvary greatly in different parts of its own area, whereas the average\r\nnumber of offspring is not a very variable element.\r\n\r\nHowever, I will say no more, but leave the problem as insoluble, only\r\nfearing that it will become a formidable weapon in the hands of the\r\nenemies of Natural Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 215. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(215/1. The following extract from a letter to Sir Joseph Hooker (dated\r\nApril 3rd, 1868) refers to his Presidential Address for the approaching\r\nmeeting of the British Association at Norwich.\r\n\r\nSome account of Sir Joseph's success is given in the \"Life and Letters,\"\r\nIII., page 100, also in Huxley's \"Life,\" Volume I., page 297, where\r\nHuxley writes to Darwin:--\r\n\r\n\"We had a capital meeting at Norwich, and dear old Hooker came out in\r\ngreat force, as he always does in emergencies. The only fault was the\r\nterrible 'Darwinismus' which spread over the section and crept out\r\nwhen you least expected it, even in Fergusson's lecture on 'Buddhist\r\nTemples.' You will have the rare happiness to see your ideas triumphant\r\nduring your lifetime.\r\n\r\n\"P.S.--I am going into opposition; I can't stand it.\")\r\n\r\nDown, April 3rd [1868].\r\n\r\nI have been thinking over your Presidential Address; I declare I made\r\nmyself quite uncomfortable by fancying I had to do it, and feeling\r\nmyself utterly dumbfounded.\r\n\r\nBut I do not believe that you will find it so difficult. When you come\r\nto Down I shall be very curious to hear what your ideas are on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nCould you make anything out of a history of the great steps in the\r\nprogress of Botany, as representing the whole of Natural History? Heaven\r\nprotect you! I suppose there are men to whom such a job would not be\r\nso awful as it appears to me...If you had time, you ought to read an\r\narticle by W. Bagehot in the April number of the \"Fortnightly\" (215/2.\r\n\"Physic and Politics,\" \"Fortnightly Review,\" Volume III., page 452,\r\n1868.), applying Natural Selection to early or prehistoric politics,\r\nand, indeed, to late politics,--this you know is your view.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 216. A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN. 9, St. Mark's Crescent,\r\nN.W., August 16th [1868].\r\n\r\nI ought to have written before to thank you for the copies of your\r\npapers on Primula and on \"Cross-unions of Dimorphic Plants, etc.\" The\r\nlatter is particularly interesting and the conclusion most important;\r\nbut I think it makes the difficulty of how these forms, with their\r\nvarying degrees of sterility, originated, greater than ever. If \"natural\r\nselection\" could not accumulate varying degrees of sterility for the\r\nplant's benefit, then how did sterility ever come to be associated with\r\none cross of a trimorphic plant rather than another? The difficulty\r\nseems to be increased by the consideration that the advantage of a cross\r\nwith a distinct individual is gained just as well by illegitimate as\r\nby legitimate unions. By what means, then, did illegitimate unions ever\r\nbecome sterile? It would seem a far simpler way for each plant's pollen\r\nto have acquired a prepotency on another individual's stigma over that\r\nof the same individual, without the extraordinary complication of three\r\ndifferences of structure and eighteen different unions with varying\r\ndegrees of sterility!\r\n\r\nHowever, the fact remains an excellent answer to the statement that\r\nsterility of hybrids proves the absolute distinctness of the parents.\r\n\r\nI have been reading with great pleasure Mr. Bentham's last admirable\r\naddress (216/1. \"Proc. Linn. Soc.\" 1867-8, page lvii.), in which he so\r\nwell replies to the gross misstatements of the \"Athenaeum;\" and also\r\nsays award in favour of pangenesis. I think we may now congratulate you\r\non having made a valuable convert, whose opinions on the subject, coming\r\nso late and being evidently so well considered, will have much weight.\r\n\r\nI am going to Norwich on Tuesday to hear Dr. Hooker, who I hope will\r\nboldly promulgate \"Darwinism\" in his address. (216/2. Sir Joseph\r\nHooker's Presidential Address at the British Association Meeting.) Shall\r\nwe have the pleasure of seeing you there?\r\n\r\nI am engaged in negociations about my book.\r\n\r\nHoping you are well and getting on with your next volumes.\r\n\r\n(216/3. We are permitted by Mr. Wallace to append the following note\r\nas to his more recent views on the question of Natural Selection and\r\nsterility:--\r\n\r\n\"When writing my \"Darwinism,\" and coming again to the consideration\r\nof this problem of the effect of Natural Selection in accumulating\r\nvariations in the amount of sterility between varieties or incipient\r\nspecies twenty years later, I became more convinced, than I was when\r\ndiscussing with Darwin, of the substantial accuracy of my argument.\r\nRecently a correspondent who is both a naturalist and a mathematician\r\nhas pointed out to me a slight error in my calculation at page 183\r\n(which does not, however, materially affect the result), disproving the\r\n'physiological selection' of the late Dr. Romanes, but he can see no\r\nfallacy in my argument as to the power of Natural Selection to increase\r\nsterility between incipient species, nor, so far as I am aware, has any\r\none shown such fallacy to exist.\r\n\r\n\"On the other points on which I differed from Mr. Darwin in the\r\nforegoing discussion--the effect of high fertility on population of a\r\nspecies, etc.--I still hold the views I then expressed, but it would be\r\nout of place to attempt to justify them here.\"\r\n\r\nA.R.W. (1899).)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 217. TO C. LYELL. Down, October 4th [1867].\r\n\r\nWith respect to the points in your note, I may sometimes have expressed\r\nmyself with ambiguity. At the end of Chapter XXIII., where I say that\r\nmarked races are not often (you omit \"often\") produced by changed\r\nconditions (217/1. \"Hence, although it must be admitted that new\r\nconditions of life do sometimes definitely affect organic beings, it\r\nmay be doubted whether well-marked races have often been produced by the\r\ndirect action of changed conditions without the aid of selection either\r\nby man or nature.\" (\"Animals and Plants,\" Volume II., page 292, 1868.)),\r\nI intended to refer to the direct action of such conditions in causing\r\nvariation, and not as leading to the preservation or destruction of\r\ncertain forms. There is as wide a difference in these two respects\r\nas between voluntary selection by man and the causes which induce\r\nvariability. I have somewhere in my book referred to the close\r\nconnection between Natural Selection and the action of external\r\nconditions in the sense which you specify in your note. And in this\r\nsense all Natural Selection may be said to depend on changed conditions.\r\nIn the \"Origin\" I think I have underrated (and from the cause which\r\nyou mention) the effects of the direct action of external conditions in\r\nproducing varieties; but I hope in Chapter XXIII. I have struck as fair\r\na balance as our knowledge permits.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful to me that you have patience to read my slips, and I\r\ncannot but regret, as they are so imperfect; they must, I think, give\r\nyou a wrong impression, and had I sternly refused, you would perhaps\r\nhave thought better of my book. Every single slip is greatly altered,\r\nand I hope improved.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the human ovule, I cannot find dimensions given, though\r\nI have often seen the statement. My impression is that it would be just\r\nor barely visible if placed on a clear piece of glass. Huxley could\r\nanswer your question at once.\r\n\r\nI have not been well of late, and have made slow progress, but I think\r\nmy book will be finished by the middle of November.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 218. A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN. [End of February, 1868]\r\n\r\nI am in the second volume of your book, and I have been astonished at\r\nthe immense number of interesting facts you have brought together. I\r\nread the chapter on pangenesis first, for I could not wait. I can hardly\r\ntell you how much I admire it. It is a positive comfort to me to have\r\nany feasible explanation of a difficulty that has always been haunting\r\nme, and I shall never be able to give it up till a better one supplies\r\nits place,--and that I think hardly possible. You have now fairly beaten\r\nSpencer on his own ground, for he really offered no solution of the\r\ndifficulties of the problem. The incomprehensible minuteness and vast\r\nnumbers of the physiological germs or atoms (which themselves must be\r\ncompounded of numbers of Spencer's physiological units) is the only\r\ndifficulty; but that is only on a par with the difficulties in all\r\nconceptions of matter, space, motion, force, etc.\r\n\r\nAs I understood Spencer, his physiological units were identical\r\nthroughout each species, but slightly different in each different\r\nspecies; but no attempt was made to show how the identical form of the\r\nparent or ancestors came to be built up of such units.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 219. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, February 27th [1868].\r\n\r\nYou cannot well imagine how much I have been pleased by what you say\r\nabout pangenesis. None of my friends will speak out, except to a certain\r\nextent Sir H. Holland, who found it very tough reading, but admits that\r\nsome view \"closely akin to it\" will have to be admitted. Hooker, as far\r\nas I understand him, which I hardly do at present, seems to think that\r\nthe hypothesis is little more than saying that organisms have such\r\nand such potentialities. What you say exactly and fully expresses my\r\nfeelings--viz., that it is a relief to have some feasible explanation\r\nof the various facts, which can be given up as soon as any better\r\nhypothesis is found. It has certainly been an immense relief to my mind;\r\nfor I have been stumbling over the subject for years, dimly seeing that\r\nsome relation existed between the various classes of facts. I now hear\r\nfrom H. Spencer that his views quoted in my footnote refer to something\r\nquite distinct, as you seem to have perceived. (219/1. This letter is\r\npublished in \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 79.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 220. A.R. WALLACE TO CHARLES DARWIN. Hurstpierpoint, March 1st,\r\n1868.\r\n\r\n...Sir C. Lyell spoke to me as if he has greatly admired pangenesis. I\r\nam very glad H. Spencer at once acknowledges that his view was something\r\nquite distinct from yours. Although, as you know, I am a great admirer\r\nof his, I feel how completely his view failed to go to the root of the\r\nmatter, as yours does. His explained nothing, though he was evidently\r\nstruggling hard to find an explanation. Yours, as far as I can see,\r\nexplains everything in growth and reproduction--though, of course, the\r\nmystery of life and consciousness remains as great as ever.\r\n\r\nParts of the chapter on pangenesis I found hard reading, and have not\r\nquite mastered yet, and there are also throughout the discussions in\r\nVolume II. many bits of hard reading, on minute points which we, who\r\nhave not worked experimentally at cultivation and crossing, as you have\r\ndone, can hardly see the importance of, or their bearing on the general\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIf I am asked, I may perhaps write an article on the book for some\r\nperiodical, and, if so, shall do what I can to make \"Pangenesis\"\r\nappreciated...\r\n\r\n(220/1. In \"Nature,\" May 25th, 1871, page 69, appeared a letter on\r\npangenesis from Mr. A.C. Ranyard, dealing with the difficulty that the\r\n\"sexual elements produced upon the scion\" have not been shown to be\r\naffected by the stock. Mr. Darwin, in an annotated copy of this letter,\r\ndisputes the accuracy of the statement, but adds: \"THE BEST OBJECTION\r\nYET RAISED.\" He seems not to have used Mr. Ranyard's remarks in the 2nd\r\nedition of the \"Variation of Animals and Plants,\" 1875.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 221. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 21st [1868].\r\n\r\nI know that you have been overworking yourself, and that makes you think\r\nthat you are doing nothing in science. If this is the case (which I do\r\nnot believe), your intellect has all run to letter-writing, for I never\r\nin all my life received a pleasanter one than your last. It greatly\r\namused us all. How dreadfully severe you are on the Duke (221/1. The\r\nlate Duke of Argyll, whose \"Reign of Law\" Sir J.D. Hooker had been\r\nreading.): I really think too severe, but then I am no fair judge, for\r\na Duke, in my eyes, is no common mortal, and not to be judged by common\r\nrules! I pity you from the bottom of my soul about the address (221/2.\r\nSir Joseph was President of the British Association at Norwich in\r\n1868: see \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 100. The reference to \"Insular\r\nFloras\" is to Sir Joseph's lecture at the Nottingham meeting of the\r\nBritish Association in 1866: see \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 47.): it\r\nmakes my flesh creep; but when I pitied you to Huxley, he would not join\r\nat all, and would only say that you did and delivered your Insular Flora\r\nlecture so admirably in every way that he would not bestow any pity\r\non you. He felt certain that you would keep your head high up.\r\nNevertheless, I wish to God it was all over for your sake. I think,\r\nfrom several long talks, that Huxley will give an excellent and original\r\nlecture on Geograph. Distrib. of birds. I have been working very\r\nhard--too hard of late--on Sexual Selection, which turns out a\r\ngigantic subject; and almost every day new subjects turn up requiring\r\ninvestigation and leading to endless letters and searches through books.\r\nI am bothered, also, with heaps of foolish letters on all sorts of\r\nsubjects, but I am much interested in my subject, and sometimes see\r\ngleams of light. All my other letters have prevented me indulging myself\r\nin writing to you; but I suddenly found the locust grass (221/3. No\r\ndoubt the plants raised from seeds taken from locust dung sent by Mr.\r\nWeale from South Africa. The case is mentioned in the fifth edition of\r\nthe \"Origin,\" published in 1869, page 439.) yesterday in flower, and had\r\nto despatch it at once. I suppose some of your assistants will be able\r\nto make the genus out without great trouble. I have done little in\r\nexperiment of late, but I find that mignonette is absolutely sterile\r\nwith pollen from the same plant. Any one who saw stamen after stamen\r\nbending upwards and shedding pollen over the stigmas of the same flower\r\nwould declare that the structure was an admirable contrivance for\r\nself-fertilisation. How utterly mysterious it is that there should be\r\nsome difference in ovules and contents of pollen-grains (for the tubes\r\npenetrate own stigma) causing fertilisation when these are taken from\r\nany two distinct plants, and invariably leading to impotence when taken\r\nfrom the same plant! By Jove, even Pan. (221/4. Pangenesis.) won't\r\nexplain this. It is a comfort to me to think that you will be surely\r\nhaunted on your death-bed for not honouring the great god Pan. I am\r\nquite delighted at what you say about my book, and about Bentham; when\r\nwriting it, I was much interested in some parts, but latterly I thought\r\nquite as poorly of it as even the \"Athenaeum.\" It ought to be read\r\nabroad for the sake of the booksellers, for five editions have come or\r\nare coming out abroad! I am ashamed to say that I have read only the\r\norganic part of Lyell, and I admire all that I have read as much as\r\nyou. It is a comfort to know that possibly when one is seventy years old\r\none's brain may be good for work. It drives me mad, and I know it does\r\nyou too, that one has no time for reading anything beyond what must be\r\nread: my room is encumbered with unread books. I agree about Wallace's\r\nwonderful cleverness, but he is not cautious enough in my opinion.\r\nI find I must (and I always distrust myself when I differ from him)\r\nseparate rather widely from him all about birds' nests and protection;\r\nhe is riding that hobby to death. I never read anything so miserable as\r\nAndrew Murray's criticism on Wallace in the last number of his Journal.\r\n(221/5. See \"Journal of Travel and Natural History,\" Volume I., No.\r\n3, page 137, London, 1868, for Andrew Murray's \"Reply to Mr. Wallace's\r\nTheory of Birds' Nests,\" which appeared in the same volume, page 73.\r\nThe \"Journal\" came to an end after the publication of one volume for\r\n1867-8.) I believe this Journal will die, and I shall not cry: what a\r\ncontrast with the old \"Natural History Review.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 222. TO J.D. HOOKER. Freshwater, Isle of Wight, July 28th [1868].\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that you are going (222/1. In his Presidential Address\r\nat Norwich.) to touch on the statement that the belief in Natural\r\nSelection is passing away. I do not suppose that even the \"Athenaeum\"\r\nwould pretend that the belief in the common descent of species is\r\npassing away, and this is the more important point. This now almost\r\nuniversal belief in the evolution (somehow) of species, I think may be\r\nfairly attributed in large part to the \"Origin.\" It would be well\r\nfor you to look at the short Introduction of Owen's \"Anat. of\r\nInvertebrates,\" and see how fully he admits the descent of species.\r\n\r\nOf the \"Origin,\" four English editions, one or two American, two French,\r\ntwo German, one Dutch, one Italian, and several (as I was told) Russian\r\neditions. The translations of my book on \"Variation under Domestication\"\r\nare the results of the \"Origin;\" and of these two English, one American,\r\none German, one French, one Italian, and one Russian have appeared, or\r\nwill soon appear. Ernst Hackel wrote to me a week or two ago, that new\r\ndiscussions and reviews of the \"Origin\" are continually still coming\r\nout in Germany, where the interest on the subject certainly does not\r\ndiminish. I have seen some of these discussions, and they are good ones.\r\nI apprehend that the interest on the subject has not died out in North\r\nAmerica, from observing in Professor and Mrs. Agassiz's Book on Brazil\r\nhow exceedingly anxious he is to destroy me. In regard to this country,\r\nevery one can judge for himself, but you would not say interest was\r\ndying out if you were to look at the last number of the \"Anthropological\r\nReview,\" in which I am incessantly sneered at. I think Lyell's\r\n\"Principles\" will produce a considerable effect. I hope I have given\r\nyou the sort of information which you want. My head is rather unsteady,\r\nwhich makes my handwriting worse than usual.\r\n\r\nIf you argue about the non-acceptance of Natural Selection, it seems to\r\nme a very striking fact that the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which\r\nseems to every one now so certain and plain, was rejected by a man\r\nso extraordinarily able as Leibnitz. The truth will not penetrate a\r\npreoccupied mind.\r\n\r\nWallace (222/2. Wallace, \"Westminster Review,\" July, 1867. The\r\narticle begins: \"There is no more convincing proof of the truth of a\r\ncomprehensive theory, than its power of absorbing and finding a place\r\nfor new facts, and its capability of interpreting phenomena, which had\r\nbeen previously looked upon as unaccountable anomalies...\" Mr. Wallace\r\nillustrates his statement that \"a false theory will never stand this\r\ntest,\" by Edward Forbes' \"polarity\" speculations (see page 84 of\r\nthe present volume) and Macleay's \"Circular\" and \"Quinarian System\"\r\npublished in his \"Horae Entomologicae,\" 1821, and developed by Swainson\r\nin the natural history volumes of \"Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia.\"\r\nMr. Wallace says that a \"considerable number of well-known naturalists\r\neither spoke approvingly of it, or advocated similar principles, and for\r\na good many years it was decidedly in the ascendant...yet it quite died\r\nout in a few short years, its very existence is now a matter of history,\r\nand so rapid was its fall that...Swainson, perhaps, lived to be the last\r\nman who believed in it. Such is the course of a false theory. That of\r\na true one is very different, as may be well seen by the progress of\r\nopinion on the subject of Natural Selection.\"\r\n\r\nHere, (page 3) follows a passage on the overwhelming importance of\r\nNatural Selection, underlined with apparent approval in Mr. Darwin's\r\ncopy of the review.), in the \"Westminster Review,\" in an article on\r\nProtection has a good passage, contrasting the success of Natural\r\nSelection and its growth with the comprehension of new classes of facts\r\n(222/3. This rather obscure phrase may be rendered: \"its power of growth\r\nby the absorption of new facts.\"), with false theories, such as the\r\nQuinarian Theory, and that of Polarity, by poor Forbes, both of\r\nwhich were promulgated with high advantages and the first temporarily\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 223. TO G.H. LEWES.\r\n\r\n(223/1. The following is printed from a draft letter inscribed by Mr.\r\nDarwin \"Against organs having been formed by direct action of medium in\r\ndistinct organisms. Chiefly luminous and electric organs and thorns.\"\r\nThe draft is carelessly written, and all but illegible.)\r\n\r\nAugust 7th, 1868.\r\n\r\nIf you mean that in distinct animals, parts or organs, such for instance\r\nas the luminous organs of insects or the electric organs of fishes, are\r\nwholly the result of the external and internal conditions to which the\r\norgans have been subjected, in so direct and inevitable a manner that\r\nthey could be developed whether of use or not to their possessor, I\r\ncannot admit [your view]. I could almost as soon admit that the whole\r\nstructure of, for instance, a woodpecker, had thus originated; and\r\nthat there should be so close a relation between structure and external\r\ncircumstances which cannot directly affect the structure seems to me to\r\n[be] inadmissible. Such organs as those above specified seem to me\r\nmuch too complex and generally too well co-ordinated with the whole\r\norganisation, for the admission that they result from conditions\r\nindependently of Natural Selection. The impression which I have taken,\r\nstudying nature, is strong, that in all cases, if we could collect all\r\nthe forms which have ever lived, we should have a close gradation from\r\nsome most simple beginning. If similar conditions sufficed, without the\r\naid of Natural Selection, to give similar parts or organs, independently\r\nof blood relationship, I doubt much whether we should have that striking\r\nharmony between the affinities, embryological development, geographical\r\ndistribution, and geological succession of all allied organisms. We\r\nshould be much more puzzled than we now are how to class, in a natural\r\nmethod, many forms. It is puzzling enough to distinguish between\r\nresemblance due to descent and to adaptation; but (fortunately\r\nfor naturalists), owing to the strong power of inheritance, and to\r\nexcessively complex causes and laws of variability, when the same end\r\nor object has been gained, somewhat different parts have generally been\r\nmodified, and modified in a different manner, so that the resemblances\r\ndue to descent and adaptation can commonly be distinguished. I should\r\njust like to add, that we may understand each other, how I suppose the\r\nluminous organs of insects, for instance, to have been developed; but I\r\ndepend on conjectures, for so few luminous insects exist that we have\r\nno means of judging, by the preservation to the present day of slightly\r\nmodified forms, of the probable gradations through which the organs have\r\npassed. Moreover, we do not know of what use these organs are. We see\r\nthat the tissues of many animals, [as] certain centipedes in England,\r\nare liable, under unknown conditions of food, temperature, etc., to\r\nbecome occasionally luminous; just like the [illegible]: such luminosity\r\nhaving been advantageous to certain insects, the tissues, I suppose,\r\nbecome specialised for this purpose in an intensified degree; in certain\r\ninsects in one part, in other insects in other parts of the body. Hence\r\nI believe that if all extinct insect-forms could be collected, we should\r\nhave gradations from the Elateridae, with their highly and constantly\r\nluminous thoraxes, and from the Lampyridae, with their highly luminous\r\nabdomens, to some ancient insects occasionally luminous like the\r\ncentipede.\r\n\r\nI do not know, but suppose that the microscopical structure of the\r\nluminous organs in the most different insects is nearly the same; and I\r\nshould attribute to inheritance from a common progenitor, the similarity\r\nof the tissues, which under similar conditions, allowed them to vary\r\nin the same manner, and thus, through Natural Selection for the same\r\ngeneral purpose, to arrive at the same result. Mutatis mutandis, I\r\nshould apply the same doctrine to the electric organs of fishes; but\r\nhere I have to make, in my own mind, the violent assumption that some\r\nancient fish was slightly electrical without having any special organs\r\nfor the purpose. It has been stated on evidence, not trustworthy, that\r\ncertain reptiles are electrical. It is, moreover, possible that the\r\nso-called electric organs, whilst in a condition not highly developed,\r\nmay have subserved some distinct function: at least, I think, Matteucci\r\ncould detect no pure electricity in certain fishes provided with the\r\nproper organs. In one of your letters you alluded to nails, claws,\r\nhoofs, etc. From their perfect coadaptation with the whole rest of the\r\norganisation, I cannot admit that they would have been formed by the\r\ndirect action of the conditions of life. H. Spencer's view that they\r\nwere first developed from indurated skin, the result of pressure on the\r\nextremities, seems to me probable.\r\n\r\nIn regard to thorns and spines I suppose that stunted and [illegible]\r\nhardened processes were primarily left by the abortion of various\r\nappendages, but I must believe that their extreme sharpness and hardness\r\nis the result of fluctuating variability and \"the survival of the\r\nfittest.\" The precise form, curvature and colour of the thorns I freely\r\nadmit to be the result of the laws of growth of each particular plant,\r\nor of their conditions, internal and external. It would be an astounding\r\nfact if any varying plant suddenly produced, without the aid of\r\nreversion or selection, perfect thorns. That Natural Selection would\r\ntend to produce the most formidable thorns will be admitted by every\r\none who has observed the distribution in South America and Africa (vide\r\nLivingstone) of thorn-bearing plants, for they always appear where the\r\nbushes grow isolated and are exposed to the attacks of mammals. Even\r\nin England it has been noticed that all spine-bearing and sting-bearing\r\nplants are palatable to quadrupeds, when the thorns are crushed. With\r\nrespect to the Malayan climbing Palm, what I meant to express is that\r\nthe admirable hooks were perhaps not first developed for climbing; but\r\nhaving been developed for protection were subsequently used, and perhaps\r\nfurther modified for climbing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 224. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, September 8th [1868].\r\n\r\nAbout the \"Pall Mall.\" (224/1. \"Pall Mall Gazette,\" August 22nd, 1868.\r\nIn an article headed \"Dr. Hooker on Religion and Science,\" and referring\r\nto the British Association address, the writer objects to any supposed\r\nopposition between religion and science. \"Religion,\" he says, \"is your\r\nopinion upon one set of subjects, science your opinion upon another set\r\nof subjects.\" But he forgets that on one side we have opinions assumed\r\nto be revealed truths; and this is a condition which either results in\r\nthe further opinion that those who bring forward irreconcilable facts\r\nare more or less wicked, or in a change of front on the religious side,\r\nby which theological opinion \"shifts its ground to meet the requirements\r\nof every new fact that science establishes, and every old error\r\nthat science exposes\" (Dr. Hooker as quoted by the \"Pall Mall\"). If\r\ntheologians had been in the habit of recognising that, in the words of\r\nthe \"Pall Mall\" writer, \"Science is a general name for human knowledge\r\nin its most definite and general shape, whatever may be the object of\r\nthat knowledge,\" probably Sir Joseph Hooker's remarks would never have\r\nbeen made.) I do not agree that the article was at all right; it struck\r\nme as monstrous (and answered on the spot by the \"Morning Advertiser\")\r\nthat religion did not attack science. When, however, I say not at all\r\nright, I am not sure whether it would not be wisest for scientific men\r\nquite to ignore the whole subject of religion. Goldwin Smith, who has\r\nbeen lunching here, coming with the Nortons (son of Professor Norton and\r\nfriend of Asa Gray), who have taken for four months Keston Rectory,\r\nwas strongly of opinion it was a mistake. Several persons have spoken\r\nstrongly to me as very much admiring your address. For chance of you\r\ncaring to see yourself in a French dress, I send a journal; also with a\r\nweak article by Agassiz on Geographical Distribution. Berkeley has sent\r\nme his address (224/2. The Rev. M.J. Berkeley was President of Section D\r\nat Norwich in 1868.), so I have had a fair excuse for writing to him. I\r\ndiffer from you: I could hardly bear to shake hands with the \"Sugar of\r\nLead\" (224/3. \"You know Mrs. Carlyle said that Owen's sweetness reminded\r\nher of sugar of lead.\" (Huxley to Tyndall, May 13th, 1887: Huxley's\r\n\"Life,\" II., page 167.), which I never heard before: it is capital. I\r\nam so very glad you will come here with Asa Gray, as if I am bad he will\r\nnot be dull. We shall ask the Nortons to come to dinner. On Saturday,\r\nWallace (and probably Mrs. W.), J. Jenner Weir (a very good man), and\r\nBlyth, and I fear not Bates, are coming to stay the Sunday. The thought\r\nmakes me rather nervous; but I shall enjoy it immensely if it does not\r\nkill me. How I wish it was possible for you to be here!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 225. TO M.J. BERKELEY. Down, September 7th, 1868.\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged to you for having sent me your address (225/1.\r\nAddress to Section D of the British Association. (\"Brit. Assoc. Report,\"\r\nNorwich meeting, 1868, page 83.))...for I thus gain a fair excuse\r\nfor troubling you with this note to thank you for your most kind and\r\nextremely honourable notice of my works.\r\n\r\nWhen I tell you that ever since I was an undergraduate at Cambridge\r\nI have felt towards you the most unfeigned respect, from all that\r\nI continually heard from poor dear Henslow and others of your great\r\nknowledge and original researches, you will believe me when I say that I\r\nhave rarely in my life been more gratified than by reading your address;\r\nthough I feel that you speak much too strongly of what I have done. Your\r\nnotice of pangenesis (225/3. \"It would be unpardonable to finish\r\nthese somewhat desultory remarks without adverting to one of the\r\nmost interesting subjects of the day,--the Darwinian doctrine of\r\npangenesis...Like everything which comes from the pen of a writer whom I\r\nhave no hesitation, so far as my judgment goes, in considering as by\r\nfar the greatest observer of our age, whatever may be thought of his\r\ntheories when carried out to their extreme results, the subject demands\r\na careful and impartial consideration.\" (Berkeley, page 86.)) has\r\nparticularly pleased me, for it has been generally neglected or\r\ndisliked by my friends; yet I fully expect that it will some day be more\r\nsuccessful. I believe I quite agree with you in the manner in which the\r\ncast-off atoms or so-called gemmules probably act (225/4. \"Assuming\r\nthe general truth of the theory that molecules endowed with certain\r\nattributes are cast off by the component cells of such infinitesimal\r\nminuteness as to be capable of circulating with the fluids, and in the\r\nend to be present in the unimpregnated embryo-cell and spermatozoid...it\r\nseems to me far more probable that they should be capable under\r\nfavourable circumstances of exercising an influence analogous to that\r\nwhich is exercised by the contents of the pollen-tube or spermatozoid on\r\nthe embryo-sac or ovum, than that these particles should be themselves\r\ndeveloped into cells\" (Berkeley, page 87).): I have never supposed that\r\nthey were developed into free cells, but that they penetrated other\r\nnascent cells and modified their subsequent development. This process\r\nI have actually compared with ordinary fertilisation. The cells thus\r\nmodified, I suppose cast off in their turn modified gemmules, which\r\nagain combine with other nascent cells, and so on. But I must not\r\ntrouble you any further.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 226. TO AUGUST WEISMANN. Down, October 22nd, 1868.\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your kind letter, and I have waited for a\r\nweek before answering it in hopes of receiving the \"kleine Schrift\"\r\n(226/1. The \"kleine Schrift\" is \"Ueber die Berechtigung der Darwin'schen\r\nTheorie,\" Leipzig, 1868. The \"Anhang\" is \"Ueber den Einfluss der\r\nWanderung und raumlichen Isolirung auf die Artbilding.\") to which you\r\nallude; but I fear it is lost, which I am much surprised at, as I have\r\nseldom failed to receive anything sent by the post.\r\n\r\nAs I do not know the title, and cannot order a copy, I should be very\r\nmuch obliged if you can spare another.\r\n\r\nI am delighted that you, with whose name I am familiar, should approve\r\nof my work. I entirely agree with what you say about each species\r\nvarying according to its own peculiar laws; but at the same time it\r\nmust, I think, be admitted that the variations of most species have in\r\nthe lapse of ages been extremely diversified, for I do not see how it\r\ncan be otherwise explained that so many forms have acquired analogous\r\nstructures for the same general object, independently of descent. I am\r\nvery glad to hear that you have been arguing against Nageli's law of\r\nperfectibility, which seems to me superfluous. Others hold similar\r\nviews, but none of them define what this \"perfection\" is which cannot\r\nbe gradually attained through Natural Selection. I thought M. Wagner's\r\nfirst pamphlet (226/2. Wagner's first essay, \"Die Darwin'sche Theorie\r\nund das Migrationsgesetz,\" 1868, is a separately published pamphlet of\r\n62 pages. In the preface the author states that it is a fuller version\r\nof a paper read before the Royal Academy of Science at Munich in March\r\n1868. We are not able to say which of Wagner's writings is referred to\r\nas the second pamphlet; his second well-known essay, \"Ueber den Einfluss\r\nder Geogr. Isolirung,\" etc., is of later date, viz., 1870.) (for I have\r\nnot yet had time to read the second) very good and interesting; but\r\nI think that he greatly overrates the necessity for emigration and\r\nisolation. I doubt whether he has reflected on what must occur when his\r\nforms colonise a new country, unless they vary during the very first\r\ngeneration; nor does he attach, I think, sufficient weight to the cases\r\nof what I have called unconscious selection by man: in these cases races\r\nare modified by the preservation of the best and the destruction of the\r\nworst, without any isolation.\r\n\r\nI sympathise with you most sincerely on the state of your eyesight: it\r\nis indeed the most fearful evil which can happen to any one who, like\r\nyourself, is earnestly attached to the pursuit of natural knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 227. TO F. MULLER. Down, March 18th [1869].\r\n\r\nSince I wrote a few days ago and sent off three copies of your book,\r\nI have read the English translation (227/1. \"Facts and Arguments for\r\nDarwin.\" See \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 37.), and cannot deny myself\r\nthe pleasure of once again expressing to you my warm admiration. I\r\nmight, but will not, repeat my thanks for the very honourable manner in\r\nwhich you often mention my name; but I can truly say that I look at the\r\npublication of your essay as one of the greatest honours ever conferred\r\non me. Nothing can be more profound and striking than your observations\r\non development and classification. I am very glad that you have added\r\nyour justification in regard to the metamorphoses of insects; for your\r\nconclusion now seems in the highest degree probable. (227/2. See \"Facts\r\nand Arguments for Darwin,\" page 119 (note), where F. Muller gives his\r\nreasons for the belief that the \"complete metamorphosis\" of insects was\r\nnot a character of the form from which insects have sprung: his\r\nargument largely depends on considerations drawn from the study of the\r\nneuroptera.) I have re-read many parts, especially that on cirripedes,\r\nwith the liveliest interest. I had almost forgotten your discussion\r\non the retrograde development of the Rhizocephala. What an admirable\r\nillustration it affords of my whole doctrine! A man must indeed be a\r\nbigot in favour of separate acts of creation if he is not staggered\r\nafter reading your essay; but I fear that it is too deep for English\r\nreaders, except for a select few.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 228. TO A.R. WALLACE. March 27th [1869].\r\n\r\nI have lately (i.e., in new edition of the \"Origin\") (228/1. Fifth\r\nedition, 1869, pages 150-57.) been moderating my zeal, and attributing\r\nmuch more to mere useless variability. I did think I would send you the\r\nsheet, but I daresay you would not care to see it, in which I discuss\r\nNageli's Essay on Natural Selection not affecting characters of\r\nno functional importance, and which yet are of high classificatory\r\nimportance. Hooker is pretty well satisfied with what I have said on\r\nthis head.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 229. TO J.D. HOOKER. Caerdeon, Barmouth, North Wales, July 24th\r\n[1869].\r\n\r\nWe shall be at home this day week, taking two days on the journey, and\r\nright glad I shall be. The whole has been a failure to me, but much\r\nenjoyment to the young...My wife has ailed a good deal nearly all the\r\ntime; so that I loathe the place, with all its beauty. I was glad to\r\nhear what you thought of F. Muller, and I agree wholly with you. Your\r\nletter came at the nick of time, for I was writing on the very day to\r\nMuller, and I passed on your approbation of Chaps. X. and XI. Some time\r\nI should like to borrow the \"Transactions of the New Zealand Institute,\"\r\nso as to read Colenso's article. (229/1. Colenso, \"On the Maori Races of\r\nNew Zealand.\" \"N.Z. Inst. Trans.\" 1868, Pt. 3.) You must read Huxley\r\nv. Comte (229/2. \"The Scientific Aspects of Positivism.\" \"Fortnightly\r\nReview,\" 1869, page 652, and \"Lay Sermons,\" 1870, page 162. This was a\r\nreply to Mr. Congreve's article, \"Mr. Huxley on M. Comte,\" published in\r\nthe April number of the \"Fortnightly,\" page 407, which had been\r\nwritten in criticism of Huxley's article in the February number of the\r\n\"Fortnightly,\" page 128, \"On the Physical Basis of Life.\"); he never\r\nwrote anything so clever before, and has smashed everybody right and\r\nleft in grand style. I had a vague wish to read Comte, and so had\r\nGeorge, but he has entirely cured us of any such vain wish.\r\n\r\nThere is another article (229/3. \"North British Review,\" Volume 50,\r\n1869: \"Geological Time,\" page 406. The papers reviewed are Sir William\r\nThomson, \"Trans. R. Soc. Edin.\" 1862; \"Phil. Mag.\" 1863; Thomson and\r\nTait, \"Natural Philosophy,\" Volume I., App. D; Sir W. Thomson, \"Proc.\r\nR. Soc. Edin.\" 1865; \"Trans. Geol. Soc. Glasgow,\" 1868 and 1869;\r\n\"Macmillan's Mag.\" 1862; Prof. Huxley, Presidential Address, \"Geol.\r\nSoc. London,\" February, 1869; Dr. Hooker, Presidential Address, \"Brit.\r\nAssoc.\" Norwich, 1868. Also the review on the \"Origin\" in the \"North\r\nBritish Review,\" 1867, by Fleeming Jenkin, and an article in the \"Pall\r\nMall Gazette,\" May 3rd, 1869. The author treats the last-named with\r\ncontempt as the work of an anonymous journalist, apparently unconscious\r\nof his own similar position.) just come out in last \"North British,\" by\r\nsome great mathematician, which is admirably done; he has a severe fling\r\nat you (229/4. The author of the \"North British\" article appears to us,\r\nat page 408, to misunderstand or misinterpret Sir J.D. Hooker's parable\r\non \"underpinning.\" See \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 101 (note). Sir\r\nJoseph is attacked with quite unnecessary vehemence on another point at\r\npage 413.), but the article is directed against Huxley and for Thomson.\r\nThis review shows me--not that I required being shown--how devilish\r\na clever fellow Huxley is, for the reviewer cannot help admiring his\r\nabilities. There are some good specimens of mathematical arrogance in\r\nthe review, and incidentally he shows how often astronomers have arrived\r\nat conclusions which are now seen to be mistaken; so that geologists\r\nmight truly answer that we must be slow in admitting your conclusions.\r\nNevertheless, all uniformitarians had better at once cry \"peccavi,\"--not\r\nbut what I feel a conviction that the world will be found rather older\r\nthan Thomson makes it, and far older than the reviewer makes it. I am\r\nglad I have faced and admitted the difficulty in the last edition of the\r\n\"Origin,\" of which I suppose you received, according to order, a copy.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 230. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, August 7th [1869].\r\n\r\nThere never was such a good man as you for telling me things which I\r\nlike to hear. I am not at all surprised that Hallett has found some\r\nvarieties of wheat could not be improved in certain desirable qualities\r\nas quickly as at first. All experience shows this with animals; but it\r\nwould, I think, be rash to assume, judging from actual experience, that\r\na little more improvement could not be got in the course of a century,\r\nand theoretically very improbable that after a few thousands [of years]\r\nrest there would not be a start in the same line of variation. What\r\nastonishes me as against experience, and what I cannot believe, is that\r\nvarieties already improved or modified do not vary in other respects.\r\nI think he must have generalised from two or three spontaneously fixed\r\nvarieties. Even in seedlings from the same capsule some vary much more\r\nthan others; so it is with sub-varieties and varieties. (230/1. In\r\na letter of August 13th, 1869, Sir J.D. Hooker wrote correcting Mr.\r\nDarwin's impression: \"I did not mean to imply that Hallett affirmed that\r\nall variation stopped--far from it: he maintained the contrary, but if\r\nI understand him aright, he soon arrives at a point beyond which any\r\nfurther accumulation in the direction sought is so small and so slow\r\nthat practically a fixity of type (not absolute fixity, however) is the\r\nresult.\")\r\n\r\nIt is a grand fact about Anoplotherium (230/2. This perhaps refers to\r\nthe existence of Anoplotherium in the S. American Eocene formation: it\r\nis one of the points in which the fauna of S. America resembles Europe\r\nrather than N. America. (See Wallace \"Geographical Distribution,\" I.,\r\npage 148.)), and shows how even terrestrial quadrupeds had time formerly\r\nto spread to very distinct regions. At each epoch the world tends to get\r\npeopled pretty uniformly, which is a blessing for Geology.\r\n\r\nThe article in \"N. British Review\" (230/3. See Letter 229.) is well\r\nworth reading scientifically; George D. and Erasmus were delighted with\r\nit. How the author does hit! It was a euphuism to speak of a fling at\r\nyou: it was a kick. He is very unfair to Huxley, and accuses him of\r\n\"quibbling,\" etc.; yet the author cannot help admiring him extremely. I\r\nknow I felt very small when I finished the article. You will be amused\r\nto observe that geologists have all been misled by Playfair, who was\r\nmisled by two of the greatest mathematicians! And there are other\r\nsuch cases; so we could turn round and show your reviewer how cautious\r\ngeologists ought to be in trusting mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThere is another excellent original article, I feel sure by McClennan,\r\non Primeval Man, well worth reading.\r\n\r\nI do not quite agree about Sabine: he is unlike every other soldier or\r\nsailor I ever heard of if he would not put his second leg into the tomb\r\nwith more satisfaction as K.C.B. than as a simple man. I quite agree\r\nthat the Government ought to have made him long ago, but what does\r\nthe Government know or care for Science? So much for your splenditious\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 231. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, August 14th [1869?]\r\n\r\nI write one line to tell you that you are a real good man to\r\npropose coming here for a Sunday after Exeter. Do keep to this good\r\nintention...I am sure Exeter and your other visit will do you good. I\r\noften wonder how you stand all your multifarious work.\r\n\r\nI quite agree about the folly of the endless subscriptions for dead men;\r\nbut Faraday is an exception, and if you will pay three guineas for me,\r\nit will save me some trouble; but it will be best to enclose a cheque,\r\nwhich, as you will see, must be endorsed. If you read the \"North British\r\nReview,\" you will like to know that George has convinced me, from\r\ncorrespondence in style, and spirit, that the article is by Tait, the\r\nco-worker with Thomson.\r\n\r\nI was much surprised at the leaves of Drosophyllum being always\r\nrolled backwards at their tips, but did not know that it was a unique\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n(PLATE: SIR J.D. HOOKER, 1870? From a photograph by Wallich.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 232. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 13th [1869].\r\n\r\nI heard yesterday from a relation who had seen in a newspaper that you\r\nwere C.B. I must write one line to say \"Hurrah,\" though I wish it had\r\nbeen K.C.B., as it assuredly ought to have been; but I suppose they look\r\nat K.C.B. before C.B. as a dukedom before an earldom.\r\n\r\nWe had a very successful week in London, and I was unusually well and\r\nsaw a good many persons, which, when well, is a great pleasure to me. I\r\nhad a jolly talk with Huxley, amongst others. And now I am at the same\r\nwork as before, and shall be for another two months--namely, putting\r\nugly sentences rather straighter; and I am sick of the work, and, as the\r\nsubject is all on sexual selection, I am weary of everlasting males and\r\nfemales, cocks and hens.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame to bother you, but I should like some time to hear about\r\nthe C.B. affair.\r\n\r\nI have read one or two interesting brochures lately--viz., Stirling\r\nthe Hegelian versus Huxley and protoplasm; Tylor in \"Journal of Royal\r\nInstitute\" on the survivals of old thought in modern civilisation.\r\n\r\nFarewell. I am as dull as a duck, both male and female.\r\n\r\nTo Dr. Hooker, C.B., F.R.S.\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker, K.C.B. (This looks better).\r\n\r\nP.S. I hear a good account of Bentham's last address (232/1.\r\nPresidential Address, chiefly on Geographical Distribution, delivered\r\nbefore the \"Linn. Soc.\" May 24th, 1869.), which I am now going to read.\r\n\r\nI find that I have blundered about Bentham's address. Lyell was speaking\r\nabout one that I read some months ago; but I read half of it again last\r\nnight, and shall finish it. Some passages are either new or were not\r\nstudied enough by me before. It strikes me as admirable, as it did on\r\nthe first reading, though I differ in some few points.\r\n\r\nSuch an address is worth its weight in gold, I should think, in making\r\nconverts to our views. Lyell tells me that Bunbury has been wonderfully\r\nimpressed with it, and he never before thought anything of our views on\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nP.S. (2). I have just read, and like very much, your review of Schimper.\r\n(232/2. A review of Schimper's \"Traite de Paleontologie Vegetale,\" the\r\nfirst portion of which was published in 1869. \"Nature,\" November 11th,\r\n1869, page 48.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 233. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 19th [1869].\r\n\r\nThank you much for telling me all about the C.B., for I much wished to\r\nhear. It pleases me extremely that the Government have done this much;\r\nand as the K.C.B.'s are limited in number (which I did not know), I\r\nexcuse it. I will not mention what you have told me to any one, as it\r\nwould be Murchisonian. But what a shame it is to use this expression,\r\nfor I fully believe that Murchison would take any trouble to get any\r\ntoken of honour for any man of science.\r\n\r\nI like all scientific periodicals, including poor \"Scientific Opinion,\"\r\nand I think higher than you do of \"Nature.\" Lord, what a rhapsody that\r\nwas of Goethe, but how well translated; it seemed to me, as I told\r\nHuxley, as if written by the maddest English scholar. It is poetry, and\r\ncan I say anything more severe? The last number of the \"Academy\" was\r\nsplendid, and I hope it will soon come out fortnightly. I wish \"Nature\"\r\nwould search more carefully all foreign journals and transactions.\r\n\r\nI am now reading a German thick pamphlet (233/1. \"Die Abhangigheit\r\nder Pflanzengestalt von Klima und Boden. Ein Beitrag zur Lehre von\r\nder Enstehung und Verbreitung der Arten, etc.\" Festschrift zur 43\r\nVersammlung Deutscher Naturforscher und Aertze in Innsbruck (Innsbruck,\r\n1869).) by Kerner on Tubocytisus; if you come across it, look at the\r\nmap of the distribution of the eighteen quasi-species, and at the\r\ngenealogical tree. If the latter, as the author says, was constructed\r\nsolely from the affinities of the forms, then the distribution is\r\nwonderfully interesting; we may see the very steps of the formation of\r\na species. If you study the genealogical tree and map, you will almost\r\nunderstand the book. The two old parent connecting links just keep alive\r\nin two or three areas; then we have four widely extended species, their\r\ndescendants; and from them little groups of newer descendants inhabiting\r\nrather small areas...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 234. TO CAMILLE DARESTE. Down, November 20th, 1869.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am glad that you are a candidate for the Chair of Physiology in Paris.\r\nAs you are aware from my published works, I have always considered your\r\ninvestigations on the production of monstrosities as full of interest.\r\nNo subject is at the present time more important, as far as my judgment\r\ngoes, than the ascertaining by experiment how far structure can be\r\nmodified by the direct action of changed conditions; and you have thrown\r\nmuch light on this subject.\r\n\r\nI observe that several naturalists in various parts of Europe have\r\nlately maintained that it is now of the highest interest for science to\r\nendeavour to lessen, as far as possible, our profound ignorance on the\r\ncause of each individual variation; and, as Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire\r\nlong ago remarked, monstrosities cannot be separated by any distinct\r\nline from slighter variations.\r\n\r\nWith my best wishes for your success in obtaining the Professorship, and\r\nwith sincere respect.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to remain, dear sir, Yours faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.V.--EVOLUTION, 1870-1882.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 235. TO J. JENNER WEIR. Down, March 17th [1870].\r\n\r\nIt is my decided opinion that you ought to send an account to some\r\nscientific society, and I think to the Royal Society. (235/1. Mr. Jenner\r\nWeir's case is given in \"Animals and Plants,\" Edition II., Volume I.,\r\npage 435, and does not appear to have been published elsewhere.\r\nThe facts are briefly that a horse, the offspring of a mare of Lord\r\nMostyn's, which had previously borne a foal by a quagga, showed a\r\nnumber of quagga-like characters, such as stripes, low-growing mane,\r\nand elongated hoofs. The passage in \"Animals and Plants,\" to which he\r\ndirects Mr. Weir's attention in reference to Carpenter's objection, is\r\nin Edition I., Volume I., page 405: \"It is a most improbable hypothesis\r\nthat the mere blood of one individual should affect the reproductive\r\norgans of another individual in such a manner as to modify the\r\nsubsequent offspring. The analogy from the direct action of foreign\r\npollen on the ovarium and seed-coats of the mother plant strongly\r\nsupports the belief that the male element acts directly on the\r\nreproductive organs of the female, wonderful as is this action, and not\r\nthrough the intervention of the crossed embryo.\" For references to Mr.\r\nGalton's experiments on transfusion of blood, see Letter 273.) I would\r\ncommunicate it if you so decide. You might give as a preliminary reason\r\nthe publication in the \"Transactions\" of the celebrated Morton case\r\nand the pig case by Mr. Giles. You might also allude to the evident\r\nphysiological importance of such facts as bearing on the theory of\r\ngeneration. Whether it would be prudent to allude to despised pangenesis\r\nI cannot say, but I fully believe pangenesis will have its successful\r\nday. Pray ascertain carefully the colour of the dam and sire. See\r\nabout duns in my book [\"Animals and Plants\"], Volume I., page 55. The\r\nextension of the mane and form of hoofs are grand new facts. Is the\r\nhair of your horse at all curly? for [an] observed case [is] given by me\r\n(Volume II., page 325) from Azara of correlation of forms of hoof with\r\ncurly hairs. See also in my book (Volume I., page 55; Volume II., page\r\n41) how exceedingly rare stripes are on the faces of horses in England.\r\nGive the age of your horse.\r\n\r\nYou are aware that Dr. Carpenter and others have tried to account for\r\nthe effects of a first impregnation from the influence of the blood\r\nof the crossed embryo; but with physiologists who believe that the\r\nreproductive elements are actually formed by the reproductive glands,\r\nthis view is inconsistent. Pray look at what I have said in \"Domestic\r\nAnimals\" (Volume I., pages 402-5) against this doctrine. It seems to\r\nme more probable that the gemmules affect the ovaria alone. I remember\r\nformerly speculating, like you, on the assertion that wives grow like\r\ntheir husbands; but how impossible to eliminate effects of imitation and\r\nsame habits of life, etc. Your letter has interested me profoundly.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Since publishing I have heard of additional cases--a very good\r\none in regard to Westphalian pigs crossed by English boar, and all\r\nsubsequent offspring affected, given in \"Illust. Landwirth-Zeitung,\"\r\n1868, page 143.\r\n\r\nI have shown that mules are often striped, though neither parent may be\r\nstriped,--due to ancient reversion. Now, Fritz Muller writes to me from\r\nS. Brazil: \"I have been assured, by persons who certainly never had\r\nheard of Lord Morton's mare, that mares which have borne hybrids to an\r\nass are particularly liable to produce afterwards striped ass-colts.\" So\r\na previous fertilisation apparently gives to the subsequent offspring a\r\ntendency to certain characters, as well as characters actually possessed\r\nby the first male.\r\n\r\nIn the reprint (not called a second edition) of my \"Domestic Animals\" I\r\ngive a good additional case of subsequent progeny of hairless dog being\r\nhairy from effects of first impregnation.\r\n\r\nP.S. 2nd. The suggestion, no doubt, is superfluous, but you ought, I\r\nthink, to measure extension of mane beyond a line joining front or back\r\nof ears, and compare with horse. Also the measure (and give comparison\r\nwith horse), length, breadth, and depth of hoofs.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 236. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, July 12th [1870].\r\n\r\nYour conclusion that all speculation about preordination is idle waste\r\nof time is the only wise one; but how difficult it is not to speculate!\r\nMy theology is a simple muddle; I cannot look at the universe as the\r\nresult of blind chance, yet I can see no evidence of beneficent design\r\nor indeed of design of any kind, in the details. As for each variation\r\nthat has ever occurred having been preordained for a special end, I\r\ncan no more believe in it than that the spot on which each drop of rain\r\nfalls has been specially ordained.\r\n\r\nSpontaneous generation seems almost as great a puzzle as preordination.\r\nI cannot persuade myself that such a multiplicity of organisms can have\r\nbeen produced, like crystals, in Bastian's (236/1. On September 2nd,\r\n1872, Mr. Darwin wrote to Mr. Wallace, in reference to the latter's\r\nreview of \"The Beginnings of Life,\" by H.C. Bastian (1872), in \"Nature,\"\r\n1872, pages 284-99: \"At present I should prefer any mad hypothesis, such\r\nas that every disintegrated molecule of the lowest forms can reproduce\r\nthe parent-form; and that these molecules are universally distributed,\r\nand that they do not lose their vital power until heated to such a\r\ntemperature that they decompose like dead organic particles.\") solutions\r\nof the same kind. I am astonished that, as yet, I have met with no\r\nallusion to Wyman's positive statement (236/2. \"Observations and\r\nExperiments on Living Organisms in Heated Water,\" by Jeffries Wyman,\r\nProf. of Anatomy, Harvard Coll. (\"Amer. Journ. Sci.\" XLIV., 1867, page\r\n152.) Solutions of organic matter in hermetically sealed flasks were\r\nimmersed in boiling water for various periods. \"No infusoria of any kind\r\nappeared if the boiling was prolonged beyond a period of five hours.\")\r\nthat if the solutions are boiled for five hours no organisms appear;\r\nyet, if my memory serves me, the solutions when opened to air\r\nimmediately became stocked. Against all evidence, I cannot avoid\r\nsuspecting that organic particles (my \"gemmules\" from the separate cells\r\nof the lower creatures!) will keep alive and afterwards multiply under\r\nproper conditions.\r\n\r\nWhat an interesting problem it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 237. TO W.B. TEGETMEIER. Down, July 15th [1870].\r\n\r\nIt is very long since I have heard from you, and I am much obliged\r\nfor your letter. It is good news that you are going to bring out a new\r\nedition of your Poultry book (237/1. \"The Poultry Book,\" 1872.), and\r\nyou are quite at liberty to use all my materials. Thanks for the curious\r\ncase of the wild duck variation: I have heard of other instances of a\r\ntendency to vary in one out of a large litter or family. I have too many\r\nthings in hand at present to profit by your offer of the loan of the\r\nAmerican Poultry book.\r\n\r\nPray keep firm to your idea of working out the subject of analogous\r\nvariations (237/2. \"By this term I mean that similar characters\r\noccasionally make their appearance in the several varieties or races\r\ndescended from the same species, and more rarely in the offspring of\r\nwidely distinct species\" (\"Animals and Plants,\" II., Edition II., page\r\n340).) with pigeons; I really think you might thus make a novel and\r\nvaluable contribution to science. I can, however, quite understand how\r\nmuch your time must be occupied with the never-ending, always-beginning\r\neditorial cares.\r\n\r\nI keep much as usual, and crawl on with my work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 238. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, September 27th [1870].\r\n\r\nYours was a splendid letter, and I was very curious to hear something\r\nabout the Liverpool meeting (238/1. Mr. Huxley was President of the\r\nBritish Association at Liverpool in 1870. His Presidential Address\r\non \"Biogenesis and Abiogenesis\" is reprinted in his collected Essays,\r\nVIII., page 229. Some account of the meeting is given in Huxley's \"Life\r\nand Letters,\" Volume I., pages 332, 336.), which I much wished to be\r\nsuccessful for Huxley's sake. I am surprised that you think his address\r\nwould not have been clear to the public; it seemed to me as clear as\r\nwater. The general line of his argument might have been answered by the\r\ncase of spontaneous combustion: tens of thousands of cases of things\r\nhaving been seen to be set on fire would be no true argument against any\r\none who maintained that flames sometimes spontaneously burst forth. I am\r\ndelighted at the apotheosis of Sir Roderick; I can fancy what neat and\r\nappropriate speeches he would make to each nobleman as he entered the\r\ngates of heaven. You ask what I think about Tyndall's lecture (238/2.\r\nTyndall's lecture was \"On the Scientific Uses of the Imagination.\"):\r\nit seemed to me grand and very interesting, though I could not from\r\nignorance quite follow some parts, and I longed to tell him how\r\nimmensely it would have been improved if all the first part had been\r\nmade very much less egotistical. George independently arrived at the\r\nsame conclusion, and liked all the latter part extremely. He thought the\r\nfirst part not only egotistical, but rather clap-trap.\r\n\r\nHow well Tyndall puts the \"as if\" manner of philosophising, and shows\r\nthat it is justifiable. Some of those confounded Frenchmen have lately\r\nbeen pitching into me for using this form of proof or argument.\r\n\r\nI have just read Rolleston's address in \"Nature\" (238/3. Presidential\r\nAddress to the Biological Section, British Association, 1870. \"Nature,\"\r\nSeptember 22nd, 1870, page 423. Rolleston referred to the vitality of\r\nseeds in soil, a subject on which Darwin made occasional observations.\r\nSee \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 65.): his style is quite unparalleled!\r\nI see he quotes you about seed, so yesterday I went and observed more\r\ncarefully the case given in the enclosed paper, which perhaps you might\r\nlike to read and burn.\r\n\r\nHow true and good what you say about Lyell. He is always the same; Dohrn\r\nwas here yesterday, and was remarking that no one stood higher in the\r\npublic estimation of Germany than Lyell.\r\n\r\nI am truly and profoundly glad that you are thinking of some general\r\nwork on Geographical Distribution, or so forth; I hope to God that your\r\nincessant occupations may not interrupt this intention. As for my book,\r\nI shall not have done the accursed proofs till the end of November\r\n(238/4. The proofs of the \"Descent of Man\" were finished on January\r\n15th, 1871.): good Lord, what a muddled head I have got on my wretched\r\nold shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 239. TO H. SETTEGAST. Down, September 29th, 1870.\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your kind letter and present of your\r\nbeautiful volume. (239/1. \"Die Thierzucht,\" 1868.) Your work is not new\r\nto me, for I heard it so highly spoken of that I procured a copy of the\r\nfirst edition. It was a great gratification to me to find a man who had\r\nlong studied with a philosophical spirit our domesticated animals, and\r\nwho was highly competent to judge, agreeing to a large extent with my\r\nviews. I regretted much that I had not known your work when I published\r\nmy last volumes.\r\n\r\nI am surprised and pleased to hear that science is not quite forgotten\r\nunder the present exciting state of affairs. Every one whom I know in\r\nEngland is an enthusiastic wisher for the full and complete success of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nP.S. I will give one of my two copies of your work to some public\r\nscientific library in London.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 240. TO THE EDITOR OF THE \"PALL MALL GAZETTE.\" Down, March 24th\r\n[1871].\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin presents his compliments to the Editor, and would be greatly\r\nobliged if he would address and post the enclosed letter to the author\r\nof the two admirable reviews of the \"Descent of Man.\" (240/1. The\r\nnotices of the \"Descent of Man,\" published in the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" of\r\nMarch 20th and 21st, 1871, were by Mr. John Morley. We are indebted to\r\nthe Editor of the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" for kindly allowing us to consult\r\nhis file of the journal.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 241. TO JOHN MORLEY. Down, March 24th, 1871.\r\n\r\nFrom the spirit of your review in the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" of my last\r\nbook, which has given me great pleasure, I have thought that you would\r\nperhaps inform me on one point, withholding, if you please, your name.\r\n\r\nYou say that my phraseology on beauty is \"loose scientifically, and\r\nphilosophically most misleading.\" (241/1. \"Mr. Darwin's work is one of\r\nthose rare and capital achievements of intellect which effect a grave\r\nmodification throughout all the highest departments of the realm of\r\nopinion...There is throughout the description and examination of Sexual\r\nSelection a way of speaking of beauty, which seems to us to be highly\r\nunphilosophical, because it assumes a certain theory of beauty, which\r\nthe most competent modern thinkers are too far from accepting, to allow\r\nits assumption to be quite judicious...Why should we only find the\r\naesthetic quality in birds wonderful, when it happens to coincide with\r\nour own? In other words, why attribute to them conscious aesthetic\r\nqualities at all? There is no more positive reason for attributing\r\naesthetic consciousness to the Argus pheasant than there is for\r\nattributing to bees geometric consciousness of the hexagonal prisms and\r\nrhombic plates of the hive which they so marvellously construct. Hence\r\nthe phraseology which Mr. Darwin employs in this part of the subject,\r\nthough not affecting the degree of probability which may belong to this\r\ntheory, seems to us to be very loose scientifically, and philosophically\r\nmost misleading.\"--\"Pall Mall Gazette.\") This is not at all improbable,\r\nas it is almost a lifetime since I attended to the philosophy of\r\naesthetics, and did not then think that I should ever make use of my\r\nconclusions. Can you refer me to any one or two books (for my power of\r\nreading is not great) which would illumine me? or can you explain in one\r\nor two sentences how I err? Perhaps it would be best for me to explain\r\nwhat I mean by the sense of beauty in its lowest stage of development,\r\nand which can only apply to animals. When an intense colour, or two\r\ntints in harmony, or a recurrent and symmetrical figure please the eye,\r\nor a single sweet note pleases the ear, I call this a sense of\r\nbeauty; and with this meaning I have spoken (though I now see in not a\r\nsufficiently guarded manner) of a taste for the beautiful being the same\r\nin mankind (for all savages admire bits of bright cloth, beads, plumes,\r\netc.) and in the lower animals. If the blue and yellow plumage of a\r\nmacaw (241/2. \"What man deems the horrible contrasts of yellow and blue\r\nattract the macaw, while ball-and-socket-plumage attracts the Argus\r\npheasant\"--\"Pall Mall Gazette,\" March 21st, 1871, page 1075.) pleases\r\nthe eye of this bird, I should say that it had a sense of beauty,\r\nalthough its taste was bad according to our standard. Now, will you have\r\nthe kindness to tell me how I can learn to see the error of my ways? Of\r\ncourse I recognise, as indeed I have remarked in my book, that the\r\nsense of beauty in the case of scenery, pictures, etc., is something\r\ninfinitely complex, depending on varied associations and culture of the\r\nmind. From a very interesting review in the \"Spectator,\" and from your\r\nand Wallace's review, I perceive that I have made a great oversight in\r\nnot having said what little I could on the acquisition of the sense\r\nfor the beautiful by man and the lower animals. It would indeed be an\r\nimmense advantage to an author if he could read such criticisms as yours\r\nbefore publishing. At page 11 of your review you accidentally misquote\r\nmy words placed by you within inverted commas, from my Volume II., page\r\n354: I say that \"man cannot endure any great change,\" and the omitted\r\nwords \"any great\" make all the difference in the discussion. (241/3.\r\n\"Mr. Darwin tells us, and gives us excellent reasons for thinking, that\r\n'the men of each race prefer what they are accustomed to behold; they\r\ncannot endure change.' Yet is there not an inconsistency between this\r\nfact and the other that one race differs from another exactly\r\nbecause novelties presented themselves, and were eagerly seized and\r\npropagated?\")\r\n\r\nPermit me to add a few other remarks. I believe your criticism is quite\r\njust about my deficient historic spirit, for I am aware of my ignorance\r\nin this line. (241/4. \"In the historic spirit, however, Mr. Darwin must\r\nfairly be pronounced deficient. When, for instance, he speaks of the\r\n'great sin of slavery' having been general among primitive nations, he\r\nforgets that, though to hold a slave would be a sinful degradation to a\r\nEuropean to-day, the practice of turning prisoners of war into slaves,\r\ninstead of butchering them, was not a sin at all, but marked a decided\r\nimprovement in human manners.\") On the other hand, if you should ever be\r\nled to read again Chapter III., and especially Chapter V., I think you\r\nwill find that I am not amenable to all your strictures; though I felt\r\nthat I was walking on a path unknown to me and full of pitfalls; but I\r\nhad the advantage of previous discussions by able men. I tried to say\r\nmost emphatically that a great philosopher, law-giver, etc., did far\r\nmore for the progress of mankind by his writings or his example than\r\nby leaving a numerous offspring. I have endeavoured to show how the\r\nstruggle for existence between tribe and tribe depends on an advance in\r\nthe moral and intellectual qualities of the members, and not merely on\r\ntheir capacity of obtaining food. When I speak of the necessity of a\r\nstruggle for existence in order that mankind should advance still higher\r\nin the scale, I do not refer to the MOST, but \"to the MORE highly\r\ngifted men\" being successful in the battle for life; I referred to\r\nmy supposition of the men in any country being divided into two equal\r\nbodies--viz., the more and the less highly gifted, and to the former on\r\nan average succeeding best.\r\n\r\nBut I have much cause to apologise for the length of this ill-expressed\r\nletter. My sole excuse is the extraordinary interest which I have felt\r\nin your review, and the pleasure which I have experienced in observing\r\nthe points which have attracted your attention. I must say one word\r\nmore. Having kept the subject of sexual selection in my mind for very\r\nmany years, and having become more and more satisfied with it, I feel\r\ngreat confidence that as soon as the notion is rendered familiar to\r\nothers, it will be accepted, at least to a much greater extent than at\r\npresent. With sincere respect and thanks...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 242. TO JOHN MORLEY. Down, April 14th [1871].\r\n\r\nAs this note requires no answer, I do not scruple to write a few lines\r\nto say how faithful and full a resume you have given of my notions on\r\nthe moral sense in the \"Pall Mall,\" and to make a few extenuating or\r\nexplanatory remarks. (242/1. \"What is called the question of the moral\r\nsense is really two: how the moral faculty is acquired, and how it is\r\nregulated. Why do we obey conscience or feel pain in disobeying it? And\r\nwhy does conscience prescribe one kind of action and condemn another\r\nkind? To put it more technically, there is the question of the\r\nsubjective existence of conscience, and there is the question of its\r\nobjective prescriptions. First, why do I think it obligatory to do my\r\nduty? Second, why do I think it my duty to do this and not do\r\nthat? Although, however, the second question ought to be treated\r\nindependently, for reasons which we shall presently suggest, the\r\nhistorical answer to it, or the various grounds on which men have\r\nidentified certain sorts of conduct with duty, rather than conduct of\r\nthe opposite sorts, throws light on the other question of the conditions\r\nof growth of the idea of duty as a sovereign and imperial director.\r\nMr. Darwin seems to us not to have perfectly recognised the logical\r\nseparation between the two sides of the moral sense question. For\r\nexample, he says (i. 97) that 'philosophers of the derivative school of\r\nmorals formerly assumed that the foundation of morality lay in a form of\r\nSelfishness; but more recently in the Greatest Happiness principle.'\r\nBut Mr. Mill, to whom Mr. Darwin refers, has expressly shown that the\r\nGreatest Happiness principle is a STANDARD, and not a FOUNDATION, and\r\nthat its validity as a standard of right and wrong action is just as\r\ntenable by one who believes the moral sense to be innate, as by one who\r\nholds that it is acquired. He says distinctly that the social feelings\r\nof mankind form 'the natural basis of sentiment for utilitarian\r\nmorality.' So far from holding the Greatest Happiness principle to\r\nbe the foundation of morality, he would describe it as the forming\r\nprinciple of the superstructure of which the social feelings of\r\nmankind are the foundation. Between Mr. Darwin and utilitarians, as\r\nutilitarians, there is no such quarrel as he would appear to suppose.\r\nThe narrowest utilitarian could say little more than Mr. Darwin says\r\n(ii. 393): 'As all men desire their own happiness, praise or blame is\r\nbestowed on actions and motives according as they tend to this end;\r\nand, as happiness is an essential part of the general good, the Greatest\r\nHappiness principle INDIRECTLY serves as a NEARLY safe standard of right\r\nand wrong.' It is perhaps not impertinent to suspect that the faltering\r\nadverbs which we have printed in italics indicate no more than the\r\nreluctance of a half-conscious convert to pure utilitarianism. In\r\nanother place (i. 98) he admits that 'as all wish for happiness, the\r\nGreatest Happiness principle will have become a most important secondary\r\nguide and object, the social instincts, including sympathy, always\r\nserving as the primary impulse and guide.' This is just what Mr. Mill\r\nsays, only instead of calling the principle a secondary guide, he would\r\ncall it a standard, to distinguish it from the social impulse, in which,\r\nas much as Mr. Darwin, he recognises the base and foundation.\"--\"Pall\r\nMall Gazette,\" April 12th, 1871.) How the mistake which I have made in\r\nspeaking of greatest happiness as the foundation of morals arose, is\r\nutterly unintelligible to me: any time during the last several years\r\nI should have laughed such an idea to scorn. Mr. Lecky never made a\r\ngreater blunder, and your kindness has made you let me off too easily.\r\n(242/2. In the first edition of the \"Descent of Man,\" I., page 97, Mr.\r\nLecky is quoted as one of those who assumed that the \"foundation\r\nof morality lay in a form of selfishness; but more recently in the\r\n'greatest happiness' principle.\" Mr. Lecky's name is omitted in this\r\nconnection in the second edition, page 120. In this edition Mr. Darwin\r\nmakes it clearer that he attaches most importance to the social instinct\r\nas the \"primary impulse and guide.\") With respect to Mr. Mill, nothing\r\nwould have pleased me more than to have relied on his great authority\r\nwith respect to the social instincts, but the sentence which I quote at\r\n[Volume I.] page 71 (\"if, as is my own belief, the moral feelings are\r\nnot innate, but acquired, they are not for that reason less natural\")\r\nseems to me somewhat contradictory with the other words which I quote,\r\nso that I did not know what to think; more especially as he says so very\r\nlittle about the social instincts. When I speak of intellectual activity\r\nas the secondary basis of conscience, I meant in my own mind secondary\r\nin period of development; but no one could be expected to understand so\r\ngreat an ellipse. With reference to your last sentence, do you not think\r\nthat man might have retrograded in his parental, marriage, and other\r\ninstincts without having retrograded in his social instincts? and I\r\ndo not think that there is any evidence that man ever existed as a\r\nnon-social animal. I must add that I have been very glad to read your\r\nremarks on the supposed case of the hive-bee: it affords an amusing\r\ncontrast with what Miss Cobbe has written in the \"Theological Review.\"\r\n(242/3. Mr. Darwin says (\"Descent of Man\" Edition I., Volume I., page\r\n73; Edition II., page 99), \"that if men lived like bees our unmarried\r\nfemales would think it a sacred duty to kill their brothers.\" Miss Cobbe\r\nremarks on this \"that the principles of social duty would be reversed\"\r\n(\"Theological Review,\" April 1872). Mr. Morley, on the other hand, says\r\nof Darwin's assertion, that it is \"as reassuring as the most absolute\r\nof moralists could desire. For it is tantamount to saying that the\r\nfoundations of morality, the distinctions of right and wrong, are deeply\r\nlaid in the very conditions of social existence; that there is in face\r\nof these conditions a positive and definite difference between the moral\r\nand the immoral, the virtuous and the vicious, the right and the wrong,\r\nin the actions of individuals partaking of that social existence.\")\r\nUndoubtedly the great principle of acting for the good of all the\r\nmembers of the same community, and therefore the good of the species,\r\nwould still have held sovereign sway.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 243. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(243/1. Sir Joseph Hooker wrote (August 5th, 1871) to Darwin about Lord\r\nKelvin's Presidential Address at the Edinburgh meeting of the British\r\nAssociation: \"It seems to me to be very able indeed; and what a good\r\nnotion it gives of the gigantic achievement of mathematicians and\r\nphysicists!--it really made one giddy to read of them. I do not think\r\nHuxley will thank him for his reference to him as a positive unbeliever\r\nin spontaneous generation--these mathematicians do not seem to me to\r\ndistinguish between un-belief and a-belief. I know no other name for the\r\nstate of mind that is produced under the term scepticism. I had no idea\r\nbefore that pure Mathematics had achieved such wonders in practical\r\nscience. The total absence of any allusion to Tyndall's labours, even\r\nwhen comets are his theme, seems strange to me.\")\r\n\r\nHaredene, Albury, Guildford, August 6th [1871].\r\n\r\nI have read with greatest interest Thomson's address; but you say so\r\nEXACTLY AND FULLY all that I think, that you have taken all the words\r\nfrom my mouth; even about Tyndall. It is a gain that so wonderful a man,\r\nthough no naturalist, should become a convert to evolution; Huxley, it\r\nseems, remarked in his speech to this effect. I should like to know what\r\nhe means about design,--I cannot in the least understand, for I presume\r\nhe does not believe in special interpositions. (243/2. See \"British\r\nAssociation Report,\" page cv. Lord Kelvin speaks very doubtfully of\r\nevolution. After quoting the concluding passage of the \"Origin,\" he goes\r\non, \"I have omitted two sentences...describing briefly the hypothesis of\r\n'the origin of species by Natural Selection,' because I have always felt\r\nthat this hypothesis does not contain the true theory of evolution,\r\nIF EVOLUTION THERE HAS BEEN in biology\" (the italics are not in\r\nthe original). Lord Kelvin then describes as a \"most valuable and\r\ninstructive criticism,\" Sir John Herschel's remark that the doctrine of\r\nNatural Selection is \"too like the Laputan method of making books, and\r\nthat it did not sufficiently take into account a continually guiding and\r\ncontrolling intelligence.\" But it should be remembered that it was\r\nin this address of Lord Kelvin's that he suggested the possibility of\r\n\"seed-bearing meteoric stones moving about through space\" inoculating\r\nthe earth with living organisms; and if he assumes that the whole\r\npopulation of the globe is to be traced back to these \"moss-grown\r\nfragments from the ruins of another world,\" it is obvious that he\r\nbelieves in a form of evolution, and one in which a controlling\r\nintelligence is not very obvious, at all events not in the initial and\r\nall-important stage.) Herschel's was a good sneer. It made me put in the\r\nsimile about Raphael's Madonna, when describing in the \"Descent of Man\"\r\nthe manner of formation of the wondrous ball-and-socket ornaments, and I\r\nwill swear to the truth of this case. (243/3. See \"Descent of Man,\"\r\nII., page 141. Darwin says that no one will attribute the shading of the\r\n\"eyes\" on the wings of the Argus pheasant to the \"fortuitous concourse\r\nof atoms of colouring-matter.\" He goes on to say that the development of\r\nthe ball-and-socket effect by means of Natural Selection seems at first\r\nas incredible as that \"one of Raphael's Madonnas should have been formed\r\nby the selection of chance daubs of paint.\" The remark of Herschel's,\r\nquoted in \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 241, that the \"Origin\"\r\nillustrates the \"law of higgledy-piggledy,\" is probably a conversational\r\nvariant of the Laputan comparison which gave rise to the passage in the\r\n\"Descent of Man\" (see Letter 130).)\r\n\r\nYou know the oak-leaved variety of the common honeysuckle; I could not\r\npersuade a lady that this was not the result of the honeysuckle climbing\r\nup a young oak tree! Is this not like the Viola case?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 244. TO JOHN LUBBOCK (LORD AVEBURY). Haredene, Albury, Guildford,\r\nAugust 12th [1871].\r\n\r\nI hope the proof-sheets having been sent here will not inconvenience\r\nyou. I have read them with infinite satisfaction, and the whole\r\ndiscussion strikes me as admirable. I have no books here, and wish much\r\nI could see a plate of Campodea. (244/1. \"On the Origin of Insects.\" By\r\nSir John Lubbock, Bart. \"Journ. Linn. Soc. (Zoology),\" Volume XI., 1873,\r\npages 422-6. (Read November 2nd, 1871.) In the concluding paragraph the\r\nauthor writes, \"If these views are correct the genus Campodea [a beetle]\r\nmust be regarded as a form of remarkable interest, since it is the\r\nliving representative of a primaeval type from which not only the\r\nCollembola and Thysanura, but the other great orders of insects, have\r\nall derived their origin.\" (See also \"Brit. Assoc. Report,\" 1872, page\r\n125--Address by Sir John Lubbock; and for a figure of Campodea see\r\n\"Nature,\" Volume VII., 1873, page 447.) I never reflected much on the\r\ndifficulty which you indicate, and on which you throw so much light.\r\n(244/2. The difficulty alluded to is explained by the first sentence of\r\nLord Avebury's paper. \"The Metamorphoses of this group (Insects) have\r\nalways seemed to me one of the greatest difficulties of the Darwinian\r\ntheory...I feel great difficulty in conceiving by what natural process\r\nan insect with a suctorial mouth, like that of a gnat or butterfly,\r\ncould be developed from a powerfully mandibulate type like the\r\northoptera, or even from the neuroptera...A clue to the difficulty\r\nmay, I think, be found in the distinction between the developmental and\r\nadaptive changes to which I called the attention of the Society in a\r\nprevious memoir.\"\r\n\r\nThe distinction between developmental and adaptive changes is mentioned,\r\nbut not discussed, in the paper \"On the Origin of Insects\" (loc. cit.,\r\npage 422); in a former paper, \"On the Development of Chloeon (Ephemera)\r\ndimidiatum (\"Trans. Linn. Soc.\" XXV. page 477, 1866), this question is\r\ndealt with at length.) I have only a few trifling remarks to make. At\r\npage 44 I wish you had enlarged a little on what you have said of the\r\ndistinction between developmental and adaptive changes; for I cannot\r\nquite remember the point, and others will perhaps be in the same\r\npredicament. I think I always saw that the larva and the adult might be\r\nseparately modified to any extent. Bearing in mind what strange changes\r\nof function parts undergo, with the intermediate state of use (244/3.\r\nThis slightly obscure phrase may be paraphrased, \"the gradational stages\r\nbeing of service to the organism.\"), it seems to me that you speak\r\nrather too boldly on the impossibility of a mandibulate insect being\r\nconverted into a sucking insect (244/4. \"There are, however, peculiar\r\ndifficulties in those cases in which, as among the lepidoptera, the same\r\nspecies is mandibulate as a larva and suctorial as an embryo\" (Lubbock,\r\n\"Origin of Insects,\" page 423).); not that I in the least doubt the\r\nvalue of your explanation.\r\n\r\nCirripedes passing through what I have called a pupal state (244/5.\r\n\"Hence, the larva in this, its last stage, cannot eat; it may be called\r\na \"locomotive Pupa;\" its whole organisation is apparently adapted for\r\nthe one great end of finding a proper site for its attachment and final\r\nmetamorphosis.\" (\"A Monograph on the Sub-Class Cirripedia.\" By Charles\r\nDarwin. London, Ray Soc., 1851.)) so far as their mouths are concerned,\r\nrather supports what you say at page 52.\r\n\r\nAt page 40 your remarks on the Argus pheasant (244/6. There is no\r\nmention of the Argus pheasant in the published paper.) (though I have\r\nnot the least objection to them) do not seem to me very appropriate\r\nas being related to the mental faculties. If you can spare me these\r\nproof-sheets when done with, I shall be obliged, as I shall be\r\ncorrecting a new edition of the \"Origin\" when I return home, though this\r\nsubject is too large for me to enter on. I thank you sincerely for the\r\ngreat interest which your discussion has given me.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 245. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(245/1. The following letter refers to Mivart's \"Genesis of Species.\")\r\n\r\nDown, September 16th [1871].\r\n\r\nI am preparing a new and cheap edition of the \"Origin,\" and shall\r\nintroduce a new chapter on gradation, and on the uses of initial\r\ncommencements of useful structures; for this, I observe, has produced\r\nthe greatest effect on most persons. Every one of his [Mivart's] cases,\r\nas it seems to me, can be answered in a fairly satisfactory manner. He\r\nis very unfair, and never says what he must have known could be said on\r\nmy side. He ignores the effect of use, and what I have said in all my\r\nlater books and editions on the direct effects of the conditions of\r\nlife and so-called spontaneous variation. I send you by this post a very\r\nclever, but ill-written review from N. America by a friend of Asa Gray,\r\nwhich I have republished. (245/2. Chauncey Wright in the \"North American\r\nReview,\" Volume CXIII., reprinted by Darwin and published as a pamphlet\r\n(see \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 145).)\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear about Huxley. You never read such strong letters\r\nMivart wrote to me about respect towards me, begging that I would\r\ncall on him, etc., etc.; yet in the \"Q. Review\" (245/3. See \"Quarterly\r\nReview,\" July 1871; also \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 147.) he\r\nshows the greatest scorn and animosity towards me, and with uncommon\r\ncleverness says all that is most disagreeable. He makes me the most\r\narrogant, odious beast that ever lived. I cannot understand him; I\r\nsuppose that accursed religious bigotry is at the root of it. Of course\r\nhe is quite at liberty to scorn and hate me, but why take such trouble\r\nto express something more than friendship? It has mortified me a good\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 246. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, October 4th [1871].\r\n\r\nI am quite delighted that you think so highly of Huxley's article.\r\n(246/1. A review of Wallace's \"Natural Selection,\" of Mivart's \"Genesis\r\nof Species,\" and of the \"Quarterly Review\" article on the \"Descent of\r\nMan\" (July, 1871), published in the \"Contemporary Review\" (1871), and in\r\nHuxley's \"Collected Essays,\" II., page 120.) I was afraid of saying all\r\nI thought about it, as nothing is so likely as to make anything appear\r\nflat. I thought of, and quite agreed with, your former saying that\r\nHuxley makes one feel quite infantile in intellect. He always thus acts\r\non me. I exactly agree with what you say on the several points in the\r\narticle, and I piled climax on climax of admiration in my letter to him.\r\nI am not so good a Christian as you think me, for I did enjoy my\r\nrevenge on Mivart. He (i.e. Mivart) has just written to me as cool as a\r\ncucumber, hoping my health is better, etc. My head, by the way, plagues\r\nme terribly, and I have it light and rocking half the day. Farewell,\r\ndear old friend--my best of friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 247. TO JOHN FISKE.\r\n\r\n(247/1. Mr. Fiske, who is perhaps best known in England as the author of\r\n\"Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy,\" had sent to Mr. Darwin some reports of\r\nthe lectures given at Harvard University. The point referred to in the\r\npostscript in Mr. Darwin's letter is explained by the following extract\r\nfrom Mr. Fiske's work: \"I have endeavoured to show that the transition\r\nfrom animality (or bestiality, stripping the word of its bad\r\nconnotations) to humanity must have been mainly determined by the\r\nprolongation of infancy or immaturity which is consequent upon a high\r\ndevelopment of intelligence, and which must have necessitated the\r\ngradual grouping together of pithecoid men into more or less definite\r\nfamilies.\" (See \"Descent,\" I., page 13, on the prolonged infancy of the\r\nanthropoid apes.))\r\n\r\nDown, November 9th, 1871.\r\n\r\nI am greatly obliged to you for having sent me, through my son, your\r\nlectures, and for the very honourable manner in which you allude to my\r\nworks. The lectures seem to me to be written with much force, clearness,\r\nand originality. You show also a truly extraordinary amount of knowledge\r\nof all that has been published on the subject. The type in many parts\r\nis so small that, except to young eyes, it is very difficult to read.\r\nTherefore I wish that you would reflect on their separate publication,\r\nthough so much has been published on the subject that the public may\r\npossibly have had enough. I hope that this may be your intention, for I\r\ndo not think I have ever seen the general argument more forcibly put so\r\nas to convert unbelievers.\r\n\r\nIt has surprised and pleased me to see that you and others have detected\r\nthe falseness of much of Mr. Mivart's reasoning. I wish I had read your\r\nlectures a month or two ago, as I have been preparing a new edition of\r\nthe \"Origin,\" in which I answer some special points, and I believe\r\nI should have found your lectures useful; but my MS. is now in the\r\nprinter's hands, and I have not strength or time to make any more\r\nadditions.\r\n\r\nP.S.--By an odd coincidence, since the above was written I have received\r\nyour very obliging letter of October 23rd. I did notice the point to\r\nwhich you refer, and will hereafter reflect more over it. I was indeed\r\non the point of putting in a sentence to somewhat of the same effect in\r\nthe new edition of the \"Origin,\" in relation to the query--Why have not\r\napes advanced in intellect as much as man? but I omitted it on account\r\nof the asserted prolonged infancy of the orang. I am also a little\r\ndoubtful about the distinction between gregariousness and sociability.\r\n\r\n...When you come to England I shall have much pleasure in making your\r\nacquaintance; but my health is habitually so weak that I have very small\r\npower of conversing with my friends as much as I wish. Let me again\r\nthank you for your letter. To believe that I have at all influenced\r\nthe minds of able men is the greatest satisfaction I am capable of\r\nreceiving.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 248. TO E. HACKEL. Down, December 27th, 1871.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your very interesting letter, which it has given me much\r\npleasure to receive. I never heard of anything so odd as the Prior in\r\nthe Holy Catholic Church believing in our ape-like progenitors. I much\r\nhope that the Jesuits will not dislodge him.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderfully active man you are! and I rejoice that you have been\r\nso successful in your work on sponges. (248/1. \"Die Kalkschwamme: eine\r\nMonographie; 3 volumes: Berlin, 1872. H.J. Clark published a paper \"On\r\nthe Spongiae Ciliatae as Infusoria flagellata\" in the \"Mem. Boston Nat.\r\nHist. Soc.\" Volume I., Part iii., 1866. See Hackel, op. cit., Volume I.,\r\npage 24.) Your book with sixty plates will be magnificent. I shall be\r\nglad to learn what you think of Clark's view of sponges being flagellate\r\ninfusorians; some observers in this country believe in him. I am glad\r\nyou are going fully to consider inheritance, which is an all-important\r\nsubject for us. I do not know whether you have ever read my chapter\r\non pangenesis. My ideas have been almost universally despised, and I\r\nsuppose that I was foolish to publish them; yet I must still think that\r\nthere is some truth in them. Anyhow, they have aided me much in making\r\nme clearly understand the facts of inheritance.\r\n\r\nI have had bad health this last summer, and during two months was able\r\nto do nothing; but I have now almost finished a next edition of the\r\n\"Origin,\" which Victor Carus is translating. (248/2. See \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" III., page 49.) There is not much new in it, except one\r\nchapter in which I have answered, I hope satisfactorily, Mr. Mivart's\r\nsupposed difficulty on the incipient development of useful structures.\r\nI have also given my reasons for quite disbelieving in great and sudden\r\nmodifications. I am preparing an essay on expression in man and the\r\nlower animals. It has little importance, but has interested me. I\r\ndoubt whether my strength will last for much more serious work. I\r\nhope, however, to publish next summer the results of my long-continued\r\nexperiments on the wonderful advantages derived from crossing. I shall\r\ncontinue to work as long as I can, but it does not much signify when\r\nI stop, as there are so many good men fully as capable, perhaps more\r\ncapable, than myself of carrying on our work; and of these you rank as\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nWith cordial good wishes for your success in all your work and for your\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 249. TO E. RAY LANKESTER. Down, April 15th [1872].\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for your kind consideration. The correspondence was in\r\nthe \"Athenaeum.\" I got some mathematician to make the calculation, and\r\nhe blundered and caused me much shame. I send scrap of proofs from last\r\nedition of the \"Origin,\" with the calculation corrected. What grand work\r\nyou did at Naples! I can clearly see that you will some day become our\r\nfirst star in Natural History.\r\n\r\n(249/1. Here follows the extract from the \"Origin,\" sixth edition, page\r\n51: \"The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder of all known animals,\r\nand I have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of\r\nnatural increase. It will be safest to assume that it begins breeding\r\nwhen thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old,\r\nbringing forth six young in the interval, and surviving till one hundred\r\nyears old; if this be so, after a period of from 740 to 750 years, there\r\nwould be nearly nineteen million elephants alive, descended from the\r\nfirst pair.\" In the fifth edition, page 75, the passage runs: \"If this\r\nbe so, at the end of the fifth century, there would be alive fifteen\r\nmillion elephants, descended from the first pair\" (see \"Athenaeum,\" June\r\n5, July 3, 17, 24, 1869).)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 250. TO C. LYELL. Down, May 10th [1872].\r\n\r\nI received yesterday morning your present of that work to which I, for\r\none, as well as so many others, owe a debt of gratitude never to be\r\nforgotten. I have read with the greatest interest all the special\r\nadditions; and I wish with all my heart that I had the strength and\r\ntime to read again every word of the whole book. (250/1. \"Principles of\r\nGeology,\" Edition XII., 1875.) I do not agree with all your criticisms\r\non Natural Selection, nor do I suppose that you would expect me to do\r\nso. We must be content to differ on several points. I differ must about\r\nyour difficulty (page 496) (250/2. In Chapter XLIII. Lyell treats\r\nof \"Man considered with reference to his Origin and Geographical\r\nDistribution.\" He criticizes the view that Natural Selection is capable\r\nof bringing about any amount of change provided a series of minute\r\ntransitional steps can be pointed out. \"But in reality,\" he writes, \"it\r\ncannot be said that we obtain any insight into the nature of the forces\r\nby which a higher grade of organisation or instinct is evolved out of a\r\nlower one by becoming acquainted with a series of gradational forms or\r\nstates, each having a very close affinity with the other.\"...\"It is when\r\nthere is a change from an inferior being to one of superior grade, from\r\na humbler organism to one endowed with new and more exalted attributes,\r\nthat we are made to feel that, to explain the difficulty, we must obtain\r\nsome knowledge of those laws of variation of which Mr. Darwin grants\r\nthat we are at present profoundly ignorant\" (op. cit., pages 496-97).)\r\non a higher grade of organisation being evolved out of lower ones. Is\r\nnot a very clever man a grade above a very dull one? and would not the\r\naccumulation of a large number of slight differences of this kind lead\r\nto a great difference in the grade of organisation? And I suppose that\r\nyou will admit that the difference in the brain of a clever and dull man\r\nis not much more wonderful than the difference in the length of the nose\r\nof any two men. Of course, there remains the impossibility of explaining\r\nat present why one man has a longer nose than another. But it is foolish\r\nof me to trouble you with these remarks, which have probably often\r\npassed through your mind. The end of this chapter (XLIII.) strikes me as\r\nadmirably and grandly written. I wish you joy at having completed your\r\ngigantic undertaking, and remain, my dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nYour ever faithful and now very old pupil, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 251. TO J. TRAHERNE MOGGRIDGE. Sevenoaks, October 9th [1872].\r\n\r\nI have just received your note, forwarded to me from my home. I thank\r\nyou very truly for your intended present, and I am sure that your book\r\nwill interest me greatly. I am delighted that you have taken up the\r\nvery difficult and most interesting subject of the habits of insects, on\r\nwhich Englishmen have done so little. How incomparably more valuable\r\nare such researches than the mere description of a thousand species! I\r\ndaresay you have thought of experimenting on the mental powers of\r\nthe spiders by fixing their trap-doors open in different ways and at\r\ndifferent angles, and observing what they will do.\r\n\r\nWe have been here some days, and intend staying some weeks; for I was\r\nquite worn out with work, and cannot be idle at home.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that your health is not worse.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 252. TO A. HYATT.\r\n\r\n(252/1. The correspondence with Professor Hyatt, of Boston, U.S.,\r\noriginated in the reference to his and Professor Cope's theories of\r\nacceleration and retardation, inserted in the sixth edition of the\r\n\"Origin,\" page 149.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, on receiving from Mr. Hyatt a copy of his \"Fossil\r\nCephalopods of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Embryology,\" from the\r\n\"Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool.\" Harvard, Volume III., 1872, wrote as follows\r\n(252/2. Part of this letter was published in \"Life and Letters,\" III.,\r\npage 154.):--)\r\n\r\nOctober 10th, 1872.\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged to you for your kindness in having sent me your\r\nvaluable memoir on the embryology of the extinct cephalopods. The work\r\nmust have been one of immense labour, and the results are extremely\r\ninteresting. Permit me to take this opportunity to express my sincere\r\nregret at having committed two grave errors in the last edition of my\r\n\"Origin of Species,\" in my allusion to yours and Professor Cope's views\r\non acceleration and retardation of development. I had thought that\r\nProfessor Cope had preceded you; but I now well remember having formerly\r\nread with lively interest, and marked, a paper by you somewhere in my\r\nlibrary, on fossil cephalopods, with remarks on the subject. (252/3. The\r\npaper seems to be \"On the Parallelism between the Different Stages of\r\nLife in the Individual and those in the Entire Group of the Molluscous\r\nOrder Tetrabranchiata,\" from the \"Boston. Soc. Nat. Hist. Mem.\" I.,\r\n1866-69, page 193. On the back of the paper is written, \"I cannot\r\navoid thinking this paper fanciful.\") It seems also that I have quite\r\nmisrepresented your joint view; this has vexed me much. I confess that I\r\nhave never been able to grasp fully what you wish to show, and I presume\r\nthat this must be owing to some dulness on my part...As the case stands,\r\nthe law of acceleration and retardation seems to me to be a simple [?]\r\nstatement of facts; but the statement, if fully established, would\r\nno doubt be an important step in our knowledge. But I had better say\r\nnothing more on the subject, otherwise I shall perhaps blunder again.\r\nI assure you that I regret much that I have fallen into two such grave\r\nerrors.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 253. A. HYATT TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(253/1. Mr. Hyatt replied in a long letter, of which only a small part\r\nis here given.\r\n\r\nCannstadt bei Stuttgart, November 1872.\r\n\r\nThe letter with which you have honoured me, bearing the date of October\r\n10th, has just reached here after a voyage to America and back.\r\n\r\nI have long had it in mind to write you upon the subject of which you\r\nspeak, but have been prevented by a very natural feeling of distrust in\r\nthe worthiness and truth of the views which I had to present.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly no occasion to apologise for not having quoted\r\nmy paper. The law of acceleration and retardation of development was\r\ntherein used to explain the appearance of other phenomena, and might, as\r\nit did in nearly all cases, easily escape notice.\r\n\r\nMy relations with Prof. Cope are of the most friendly character; and\r\nalthough fortunate in publishing a few months ahead, I consider that\r\nthis gives me no right to claim anything beyond such an amount\r\nof participation in the discovery, if it may be so called, as the\r\nthoroughness and worth of my work entitles me to...\r\n\r\nThe collections which I have studied, it will be remembered, are fossils\r\ncollected without special reference to the very minute subdivisions,\r\nsuch as the subdivisions of the Lower or Middle Lias as made by the\r\nGerman authors, especially Quenstedt and Oppel, but pretty well defined\r\nfor the larger divisions in which the species are also well defined.\r\nThe condition of the collections as regards names, etc., was chaotic,\r\nlocalities alone, with some few exceptions, accurate. To put this in\r\norder they were first arranged according to their adult characteristics.\r\nThis proving unsatisfactory, I determined to test thoroughly the theory\r\nof evolution by following out the developmental history of each species\r\nand placing them within their formations, Middle or Upper Lias, Oolite\r\nor so, according to the extent to which they represented each other's\r\ncharacteristics. Thus an adult of simple structure being taken as the\r\nstarting-point which we will call a, another species which was a in\r\nits young stage and became b in the adult was placed above it in the\r\nzoological series. By this process I presently found that a, then a b\r\nand a b c, c representing the adult stage, were very often found; but\r\nthat practically after passing these two or three stages it did not\r\noften happen that a species was found which was a b c in the young and\r\nthen became d in the adult. But on the other hand I very frequently\r\nfound one which, while it was a in the young, skipped the stages b and\r\nc and became d while still quite young. Then sometimes, though more\r\nrarely, a species would be found belonging to the same series, which\r\nwould be a in the young and with a very faint and fleeting resemblance\r\nto d at a later stage, pass immediately while still quite young to the\r\nmore advanced characteristics represented by e, and hold these as its\r\nspecific characteristics until old age destroyed them. This skipping is\r\nthe highest exemplification, or rather manifestation, of acceleration in\r\ndevelopment. In alluding to the history of diseases and inheritance of\r\ncharacteristics, you in your \"Origin of Species\" allude to the ordinary\r\nmanifestation of acceleration, when you speak of the tendency of\r\ndiseases or characteristics to appear at younger periods in the life of\r\nthe child than of its parents. This, according to my observations, is\r\na law, or rather mode, of development, which is applicable to all\r\ncharacteristics, and in this way it is possible to explain why the young\r\nof later-occurring animals are like the adult stages of those which\r\npreceded them in time. If I am not mistaken you have intimated something\r\nof this sort also in your first edition, but I have not been able to\r\nfind it lately. Of course this is a very normal condition of affairs\r\nwhen a series can be followed in this way, beginning with species a,\r\nthen going through species a b to a b c, then a b d or a c d, and then\r\na d e or simply a e, as it sometimes comes. Very often the acceleration\r\ntakes place in two closely connected series, thus:\r\n\r\na--ab--abd--ae---ad\r\n\r\nin which one series goes on very regularly, while another lateral\r\noffshoot of a becomes d in the adult. This is an actual case which can\r\nbe plainly shown with the specimens in hand, and has been verified in\r\nthe collections here. Retardation is entirely Prof. Cope's idea, but I\r\nthink also easily traceable. It is the opponent of acceleration, so to\r\nspeak, or the opposite or negative of that mode of development. Thus\r\nseries may occur in which, either in size or characteristics, they\r\nreturn to former characteristics; but a better discussion of this point\r\nyou will find in the little treatise which I send by the same mail as\r\nthis letter, \"On Reversions among the Ammonites.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 254. TO A. HYATT. Down, December 4th, 1872.\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your most interesting letter. You refer much\r\ntoo modestly to your own knowledge and judgment, as you are much better\r\nfitted to throw light on your own difficult problems than I am.\r\n\r\nIt has quite annoyed me that I do not clearly understand yours and Prof.\r\nCope's views (254/1. Prof. Cope's views may be gathered from his \"Origin\r\nof the Fittest\" 1887; in this book (page 41) is reprinted his \"Origin\r\nof Genera\" from the \"Proc. Philadelph. Acad. Nat. Soc.\" 1868, which was\r\npublished separately by the author in 1869, and which we believe to be\r\nhis first publication on the subject. In the preface to the \"Origin of\r\nthe Fittest,\" page vi, he sums up the chief points in the \"Origin\r\nof Genera\" under seven heads, of which the following are the most\r\nimportant:--\"First, that development of new characters has been\r\naccomplished by an ACCELERATION or RETARDATION in the growth of the\r\nparts changed...Second, that of EXACT PARALLELISM between the adult of\r\none individual or set of individuals, and a transitional stage of one or\r\nmore other individuals. This doctrine is distinct from that of an exact\r\nparallelism, which had already been stated by von Baer.\" The last point\r\nis less definitely stated by Hyatt in his letter of December 4th, 1872.\r\n\"I am thus perpetually led to look upon a series very much as upon an\r\nindividual, and think that I have found that in many instances these\r\nafford parallel changes.\" See also \"Lamarck the Founder of Evolution, by\r\nA.S. Packard: New York, 1901.) and the fault lies in some slight degree,\r\nI think, with Prof. Cope, who does not write very clearly. I think I\r\nnow understand the terms \"acceleration\" and \"retardation\"; but will\r\nyou grudge the trouble of telling me, by the aid of the following\r\nillustration, whether I do understand rightly? When a fresh-water\r\ndecapod crustacean is born with an almost mature structure, and\r\ntherefore does not pass, like other decapods, through the Zoea stage,\r\nis this not a case of acceleration? Again, if an imaginary decapod\r\nretained, when adult, many Zoea characters, would this not be a case of\r\nretardation? If these illustrations are correct, I can perceive why I\r\nhave been so dull in understanding your views. I looked for something\r\nelse, being familiar with such cases, and classing them in my own mind\r\nas simply due to the obliteration of certain larval or embryonic stages.\r\nThis obliteration I imagined resulted sometimes entirely from that law\r\nof inheritance to which you allude; but that it in many cases was\r\naided by Natural Selection, as I inferred from such cases occurring\r\nso frequently in terrestrial and fresh-water members of groups, which\r\nretain their several embryonic stages in the sea, as long as fitting\r\nconditions are present.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of my misunderstanding was the assumption that in your\r\nseries\r\n\r\na--ab--abd--ae,--------ad\r\n\r\nthe differences between the successive species, expressed by the\r\nterminal letter, was due to acceleration: now, if I understand rightly,\r\nthis is not the case; and such characters must have been independently\r\nacquired by some means.\r\n\r\nThe two newest and most interesting points in your letter (and in,\r\nas far as I think, your former paper) seem to me to be about senile\r\ncharacteristics in one species appearing in succeeding species during\r\nmaturity; and secondly about certain degraded characters appearing in\r\nthe last species of a series. You ask for my opinion: I can only send\r\nthe conjectured impressions which have occurred to me and which are\r\nnot worth writing. (It ought to be known whether the senile character\r\nappears before or after the period of active reproduction.) I should be\r\ninclined to attribute the character in both your cases to the laws of\r\ngrowth and descent, secondarily to Natural Selection. It has been an\r\nerror on my part, and a misfortune to me, that I did not largely discuss\r\nwhat I mean by laws of growth at an early period in some of my books. I\r\nhave said something on this head in two new chapters in the last edition\r\nof the \"Origin.\" I should be happy to send you a copy of this edition,\r\nif you do not possess it and care to have it. A man in extreme old age\r\ndiffers much from a young man, and I presume every one would account for\r\nthis by failing powers of growth. On the other hand the skulls of some\r\nmammals go on altering during maturity into advancing years; as do the\r\nhorns of the stag, the tail-feathers of some birds, the size of fishes\r\netc.; and all such differences I should attribute simply to the laws of\r\ngrowth, as long as full vigour was retained. Endless other changes of\r\nstructure in successive species may, I believe, be accounted for by\r\nvarious complex laws of growth. Now, any change of character thus\r\ninduced with advancing years in the individual might easily be inherited\r\nat an earlier age than that at which it first supervened, and thus\r\nbecome characteristic of the mature species; or again, such changes\r\nwould be apt to follow from variation, independently of inheritance,\r\nunder proper conditions. Therefore I should expect that characters of\r\nthis kind would often appear in later-formed species without the aid\r\nof Natural Selection, or with its aid if the characters were of any\r\nadvantage. The longer I live, the more I become convinced how ignorant\r\nwe are of the extent to which all sorts of structures are serviceable\r\nto each species. But that characters supervening during maturity in\r\none species should appear so regularly, as you state to be the case, in\r\nsucceeding species, seems to me very surprising and inexplicable.\r\n\r\nWith respect to degradation in species towards the close of a series,\r\nI have nothing to say, except that before I arrived at the end of your\r\nletter, it occurred to me that the earlier and simpler ammonites must\r\nhave been well adapted to their conditions, and that when the species\r\nwere verging towards extinction (owing probably to the presence of some\r\nmore successful competitors) they would naturally become re-adapted to\r\nsimpler conditions. Before I had read your final remarks I thought also\r\nthat unfavourable conditions might cause, through the law of growth,\r\naided perhaps by reversion, degradation of character. No doubt many new\r\nlaws remain to be discovered. Permit me to add that I have never been\r\nso foolish as to imagine that I have succeeded in doing more than to lay\r\ndown some of the broad outlines of the origin of species.\r\n\r\nAfter long reflection I cannot avoid the conviction that no innate\r\ntendency to progressive development exists, as is now held by so many\r\nable naturalists, and perhaps by yourself. It is curious how seldom\r\nwriters define what they mean by progressive development; but this is a\r\npoint which I have briefly discussed in the \"Origin.\" I earnestly hope\r\nthat you may visit Hilgendorf's famous deposit. Have you seen Weismann's\r\npamphlet \"Einfluss der Isolirung,\" Leipzig, 1872? He makes splendid use\r\nof Hilgendorf's admirable observations. (254/2. Hilgendorf, \"Monatsb.\r\nK. Akad.\" Berlin, 1866. For a semi-popular account of Hilgendorf's and\r\nHyatt's work on this subject, see Romanes' \"Darwin and after Darwin,\"\r\nI., page 201.) I have no strength to spare, being much out of health;\r\notherwise I would have endeavoured to have made this letter better\r\nworth sending. I most sincerely wish you success in your valuable and\r\ndifficult researches.\r\n\r\nI have received, and thank you, for your three pamphlets. As far as I\r\ncan judge, your views seem very probable; but what a fearfully intricate\r\nsubject is this of the succession of ammonites. (254/3. See various\r\npapers in the publications of the \"Boston Soc. Nat. Hist.\" and in the\r\n\"Bulletin of the Harvard Museum of Comp. Zoology.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 255. A. HYATT TO CHARLES DARWIN. Cannstadt bei Stuttgart,\r\nDecember 8th, 1872.\r\n\r\nThe quickness and earnestness of your reply to my letter gives me\r\nthe greatest encouragement, and I am much delighted at the unexpected\r\ninterest which your questions and comments display. What you say about\r\nProf. Cope's style has been often before said to me, and I have remarked\r\nin his writings an unsatisfactory treatment of our common theory. This,\r\nI think, perhaps is largely due to the complete absorption of his\r\nmind in the contemplation of his subject: this seems to lead him to be\r\ncareless about the methods in which it may be best explained. He has,\r\nhowever, a more extended knowledge than I have, and has in many ways a\r\nmore powerful grasp of the subject, and for that very reason, perhaps,\r\nis liable to run into extremes. You ask about the skipping of the Zoea\r\nstage in fresh-water decapods: is this an illustration of acceleration?\r\nIt most assuredly is, if acceleration means anything at all. Again,\r\nanother and more general illustration would be, if, among the marine\r\ndecapods, a series could be formed in which the Zoea stage became less\r\nand less important in the development, and was relegated to younger and\r\nyounger stages of the development, and finally disappeared in those to\r\nwhich you refer. This is the usual way in which the accelerated mode\r\nof development manifests itself; though near the lowest or earliest\r\noccurring species it is also to be looked for. Perhaps this to which\r\nyou allude is an illustration somewhat similar to the one which I have\r\nspoken of in my series,\r\n\r\na--ab--abc--ae--------ad,\r\n\r\nwhich like \"a d\" comes from the earliest of a series, though I should\r\nthink from the entire skipping of the Zoea stage that it must be, like\r\n\"a e,\" the result of a long line of ancestors. In fact, the essential\r\npoint of our theory is, that characteristics are ever inherited by the\r\nyoung at earlier periods than they are assumed in due course of growth\r\nby the parents, and that this must eventually lead to the extinction or\r\nskipping of these characteristics altogether...\r\n\r\nSuch considerations as these and the fact that near the heads of series\r\nor near the latest members of series, and not at the beginning, were\r\nusually found the accelerated types, which skipped lower characteristics\r\nand developed very suddenly to a higher and more complex standpoint in\r\nstructure, led both Cope and [myself] into what may be a great error. I\r\nsee that it has led you at least into the difficulty of which you very\r\nrightly complain, and which, I am sorry to see, has cost you some\r\nof your valuable time. We presumed that because characteristics were\r\nperpetually inherited at earlier stages, that this very concentration\r\nof the developed characteristics made room for the production of\r\ndifferences in the adult descendants of any given pair. Further, that in\r\nthe room thus made other different characteristics must be produced, and\r\nthat these would necessarily appear earlier in proportion as the\r\nspecies was more or less accelerated, and be greater or less in the same\r\nproportion. Finally, that in the most accelerated, such as \"a c\" or \"a\r\nd,\" the difference would be so great as to constitute distinct genera.\r\nCope and I have differed very much, while he acknowledged the action of\r\nthe accumulated mode of development only when generic characteristics or\r\ngreater differences were produced, I saw the same mode of development to\r\nbe applicable in all cases and to all characteristics, even to diseases.\r\nSo far the facts bore us out, but when we assumed that the adult\r\ndifferences were the result of the accelerated mode of development,\r\nwe were perhaps upon rather insecure ground. It is evidently this\r\nassumption which has led you to misunderstand the theory. Cope founded\r\nhis belief, that the adult characteristics were also the result of\r\nacceleration, if I rightly remember it, mainly upon the class of facts\r\nspoken of above in man where a sudden change into two organs may produce\r\nentirely new and unexpected differences in the whole organisation,\r\nand upon the changes which acceleration appeared to produce in the\r\ndevelopment of each succeeding species. Your difficulty in understanding\r\nthe theory and the observations you have made show me at once what my\r\nown difficulties have been, but of these I will not speak at present, as\r\nmy letter is spinning itself out to a fearful length.\r\n\r\n(255/1. After speaking of Cope's comparison of acceleration and\r\nretardation in evolution to the force of gravity in physical matters Mr.\r\nHyatt goes on:--)\r\n\r\nNow it [acceleration] seems to me to explain less and less the origin of\r\nadult progressive characteristics or simply differences, and perhaps now\r\nI shall get on faster with my work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 256. TO A. HYATT. Down, December 14th [1872].\r\n\r\n(256/1. In reply to the above letter (255) from Mr. Hyatt.)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the kind consideration shown in your last sentence, I\r\nmust thank you for your interesting and clearly expressed letter. I\r\nhave directed my publisher to send you a copy of the last edition of the\r\n\"Origin,\" and you can, if you like, paste in the \"From the Author\"\r\non next page. In relation to yours and Professor Cope's view on\r\n\"acceleration\" causing a development of new characters, it would, I\r\nthink, be well if you were to compare the decapods which pass and do not\r\npass through the Zoea stage, and the one group which does (according to\r\nFritz Muller) pass through to the still earlier Nauplius stages, and see\r\nif they present any marked differences. You will, I believe, find that\r\nthis is not the case. I wish it were, for I have often been perplexed at\r\nthe omission of embryonic stages as well as the acquirement of peculiar\r\nstages appearing to produce no special result in the mature form.\r\n\r\n(256/2. The remainder of this letter is missing, and the whole of the\r\nlast sentence is somewhat uncertainly deciphered. (Note by Mr. Hyatt.))\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 257. TO A. HYATT. Down, February 13th, 1877.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your very kind, long, and interesting letter. The case\r\nis so wonderful and difficult that I dare not express any opinion on it.\r\nOf course, I regret that Hilgendorf has been proved to be so greatly\r\nin error (257/1. This refers to a controversy with Sandberger, who had\r\nattacked Hilgendorf in the \"Verh. der phys.-med. Ges. zu Wurzburg,\" Bd.\r\nV., and in the \"Jahrb. der Malakol. Ges.\" Bd. I., to which Hilgendorf\r\nreplied in the \"Zeitschr. d. Deutschen geolog. Ges.\" Jahrb. 1877.\r\nHyatt's name occurs in Hilgendorf's pages, but we find no reference to\r\nany paper of this date; his well-known paper is in the \"Boston. Soc.\r\nNat. Hist.\" 1880. In a letter to Darwin (May 23rd, 1881) Hyatt regrets\r\nthat he had no opportunity of a third visit to Steinheim, and goes on:\r\n\"I should then have done greater justice to Hilgendorf, for whom I have\r\nsuch a high respect.\"), but it is some selfish comfort to me that I\r\nalways felt so much misgiving that I never quoted his paper. (257/2. In\r\nthe fifth edition of the \"Origin\" (page 362), however, Darwin speaks of\r\nthe graduated forms of Planorbis multiformis, described by Hilgendorf\r\nfrom certain beds in Switzerland, by which we presume he meant the\r\nSteinheim beds in Wurtemberg.) The variability of these shells is quite\r\nastonishing, and seems to exceed that of Rubus or Hieracium amongst\r\nplants. The result which surprises me most is that the same form should\r\nbe developed from various and different progenitors. This seems to show\r\nhow potent are the conditions of life, irrespectively of the variations\r\nbeing in any way beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe production of a species out of a chaos of varying forms reminds me\r\nof Nageli's conclusion, as deduced from the study of Hieracium, that\r\nthis is the common mode in which species arise. But I still continue to\r\ndoubt much on this head, and cling to the belief expressed in the first\r\nedition of the \"Origin,\" that protean or polymorphic species are those\r\nwhich are now varying in such a manner that the variations are neither\r\nadvantageous nor disadvantageous. I am glad to hear of the Brunswick\r\ndeposit, as I feel sure that the careful study of such cases is highly\r\nimportant. I hope that the Smithsonian Institution will publish your\r\nmemoir.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 258. TO A. DE CANDOLLE. Down, January 18th [1873].\r\n\r\nIt was very good of you to give up so much of your time to write to me\r\nyour last interesting letter. The evidence seems good about the tameness\r\nof the alpine butterflies, and the fact seems to me very surprising, for\r\neach butterfly can hardly have acquired its experience during its own\r\nshort life. Will you be so good as to thank M. Humbert for his note,\r\nwhich I have been glad to read. I formerly received from a man, not\r\na naturalist, staying at Cannes a similar account, but doubted about\r\nbelieving it. The case, however, does not answer my query--viz., whether\r\nbutterflies are attracted by bright colours, independently of the\r\nsupposed presence of nectar?\r\n\r\nI must own that I have great difficulty in believing that any temporary\r\ncondition of the parents can affect the offspring. If it last long\r\nenough to affect the health or structure of the parents, I can quite\r\nbelieve the offspring would be modified. But how mysterious a subject\r\nis that of generation! Although my hypothesis of pangenesis has been\r\nreviled on all sides, yet I must still look at generation under this\r\npoint of view; and it makes me very averse to believe in an emotion\r\nhaving any effect on the offspring. Allow me to add one word about\r\nblushing and shyness: I intended only to say the habit was primordially\r\nacquired by attention to the face, and not that each shy man now\r\nattended to his personal appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 259. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, June 28th, 1873.\r\n\r\nI write a line to wish you good-bye, as I hear you are off on Wednesday,\r\nand to thank you for the Dionoea, but I cannot make the little creature\r\ngrow well. I have this day read Bentham's last address, and must\r\nexpress my admiration of it. (259/1. Presidential address to the Linnean\r\nSociety, read May 24th, 1873.) Perhaps I ought not to do so, as he\r\nfairly crushes me with honour.\r\n\r\nI am delighted to see how exactly I agree with him on affinities, and\r\nespecially on extinct forms as illustrated by his flat-topped tree.\r\n(259/2. See page 15 of separate copy: \"We should then have the present\r\nraces represented by the countless branchlets forming the flat-topped\r\nsummit\" of a genealogical tree, in which \"all we can do is to map out\r\nthe summit as it were from a bird's-eye view, and under each cluster, or\r\ncluster of clusters, to place as the common trunk an imaginary type of a\r\ngenus, order, or class according to the depth to which we would go.\")\r\nMy recent work leads me to differ from him on one point--viz., on the\r\nseparation of the sexes. (259/3. On the question of sexuality, see\r\npage 10 of Bentham's address. On the back of Mr. Darwin's copy he has\r\nwritten: \"As long as lowest organisms free--sexes separated: as soon as\r\nthey become attached, to prevent sterility sexes united--reseparated as\r\nmeans of fertilisation, adapted [?] for distant [?] organisms,--in the\r\ncase of animals by their senses and voluntary movements,--with plants\r\nthe aid of insects and wind, the latter always existed, and long\r\nretained.\" The two words marked [?] are doubtful. The introduction\r\nof freedom or attachedness, as a factor in the problem also occurs in\r\n\"Cross and Self-fertilisation,\" page 462. I strongly suspect that sexes\r\nwere primordially in distinct individuals; then became commonly united\r\nin the same individual, and then in a host of animals and some few\r\nplants became again separated. Do ask Bentham to send a copy of his\r\naddress to \"Dr. H. Muller, Lippstadt, Prussia,\" as I am sure it will\r\nplease him GREATLY.\r\n\r\n...When in France write me a line and tell me how you get on, and how\r\nHuxley is; but do not do so if you feel idle, and writing bothers you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 260. TO R. MELDOLA.\r\n\r\n(260/1. This letter, with others from Darwin to Meldola, is published in\r\n\"Charles Darwin and the Theory of Natural Selection,\" by E.B. Poulton,\r\npages 199 et seq., London, 1896.)\r\n\r\nSouthampton, August 13th, 1873.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your present, which no doubt I shall find at Down\r\non my return home. I am sorry to say that I cannot answer your question;\r\nnor do I believe that you could find it anywhere even approximately\r\nanswered. It is very difficult or impossible to define what is meant\r\nby a large variation. Such graduate into monstrosities or generally\r\ninjurious variations. I do not myself believe that these are often or\r\never taken advantage of under nature. It is a common occurrence that\r\nabrupt and considerable variations are transmitted in an unaltered\r\nstate, or not at all transmitted, to the offspring, or to some of them.\r\nSo it is with tailless or hornless animals, and with sudden and great\r\nchanges of colour in flowers. I wish I could have given you any answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 261. TO E.S. MORSE. [Undated.]\r\n\r\nI must have the pleasure of thanking you for your kindness in sending me\r\nyour essay on the Brachiopoda. (261/1. \"The Brachiopoda, a Division of\r\nAnnelida,\" \"Amer. Assoc. Proc.\" Volume XIX., page 272, 1870, and \"Annals\r\nand Mag. Nat. Hist.\" Volume VI., page 267, 1870.) I have just read\r\nit with the greatest interest, and you seem to me (though I am not a\r\ncompetent judge) to make out with remarkable clearness an extremely\r\nstrong case. What a wonderful change it is to an old naturalist to have\r\nto look at these \"shells\" as \"worms\"; but, as you truly say, as far as\r\nexternal appearance is concerned, the case is not more wonderful than\r\nthat of cirripedes. I have also been particularly interested by your\r\nremarks on the Geological Record, and on the lower and older forms in\r\neach great class not having been probably protected by calcareous valves\r\nor a shell.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Your woodcut of Lingula is most skilfully introduced to compel one\r\nto see its likeness to an annelid.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 262.

Mr. Gladstone, in protest against some\r\nwords of Mr. Spencer, had said that the appearance of great men \"in\r\ngreat crises of human history\" were events so striking \"that men would\r\nbe liable to term them providential in a pre-scientific age.\" On this\r\nMr. Spencer remarks that \"in common with the ancient Greek Mr. Gladstone\r\nregards as irreligious any explanation of Nature which dispenses with\r\nimmediate Divine superintendence.\" And as an instance of the\r\npartnership \"between the ideas of natural causation and of providential\r\ninterference,\" he instances a case where a prince \"gained popularity\r\nby outliving certain abnormal changes in his blood,\" and where \"on the\r\noccasion of his recovery providential aid and natural causation were\r\nunitedly recognised by a thanksgiving to God and a baronetcy to the\r\ndoctor.\" The passage on Toryism is on page 395, where Mr. Spencer, with\r\nhis accustomed tolerance, writes: \"The desirable thing is that a growth\r\nof ideas and feelings tending to produce modification shall be joined\r\nwith a continuance of ideas and feelings tending to preserve stability.\"\r\nAnd from this point of view he concludes it to be very desirable that\r\n\"one in Mr. Gladstone's position should think as he does.\" The matter\r\nis further discussed in the notes to Chapter XVI., page 423.) I never\r\nbefore read a good defence of Toryism. In one place (but I cannot for\r\nthe life of me recollect where or what it exactly was) I thought that\r\nyou would have profited by my principle (i.e. if you do not reject it)\r\ngiven in my \"Descent of Man,\" that new characters which appear late\r\nin life are those which are transmitted to the same sex alone. I have\r\nadvanced some pretty strong evidence, and the principle is of great\r\nimportance in relation to secondary sexual likenesses. (262/3. This\r\nrefers to Mr. Spencer's discussion of the evolution of the mental traits\r\ncharacteristic of women. At page 377 he points out the importance of\r\nthe limitation of heredity by sex in this relation. A striking\r\ngeneralisation on this question is given in the \"Descent of Man,\"\r\nEdition I., Volume II., page 285: that when the adult male differs from\r\nthe adult female, he differs in the same way from the young of both\r\nsexes. Can this law be applied in the case in which the adult female\r\npossesses characters not possessed by the male: for instance, the high\r\ndegree of intuitive power of reading the mental states of others and of\r\nconcealing her own--characters which Mr. Spencer shows to be accounted\r\nfor by the relations between the husband and wife in a state of\r\nsavagery. If so, the man should resemble \"the young of both sexes\" in\r\nthe absence of these special qualities. This seems to be the case with\r\nsome masculine characteristics, and childishness of man is not without\r\nrecognition among women: for instance, by Dolly Winthrop in \"Silas\r\nMarner,\" who is content with bread for herself, but bakes cake for\r\nchildren and men, whose \"stomichs are made so comical, they want a\r\nchange--they do, I know, God help 'em.\") I have applied it to man and\r\nwoman, and possibly it was here that I thought that you would have\r\nprofited by the doctrine. I fear that this note will be almost\r\nillegible, but I am very tired.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 263. G.J. ROMANES TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(263/1. This is, we believe, the first letter addressed by the late Mr.\r\nRomanes to Mr. Darwin. It was put away with another on the same subject,\r\nand inscribed \"Romanes on Abortion, with my answer (very important).\"\r\nMr. Darwin's answer given below is printed from his rough draft, which\r\nis in places barely decipherable. On the subject of these letters\r\nconsult Romanes, \"Darwin and after Darwin,\" Volume II., page 99, 1895.)\r\n\r\nDunskaith, Parkhill, Ross-shire, July 10th, 1874.\r\n\r\nKnowing that you do not dissuade the more attentive of your readers from\r\ncommunicating directly to yourself any ideas they may have upon subjects\r\nconnected with your writings, I take the liberty of sending the enclosed\r\ncopy of a letter, which I have recently addressed to Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer. You will perceive that the subject dealt with is the same as\r\nthat to which a letter of mine in last week's \"Nature\" [July 2nd,\r\npage 164] refers--viz., \"Disuse as a Reducing Cause in Species.\"\r\nIn submitting this more detailed exposition of my views to your\r\nconsideration, I should like to state again what I stated in \"Nature\"\r\nsome weeks ago, viz., that in propounding the cessation of selection as\r\na reducing cause, I do not suppose that I am suggesting anything which\r\nhas not occurred to you already. Not only is this principle embodied\r\nin the theory set forth in the article on Rudimentary Organs (\"Nature,\"\r\nVolume IX.); but it is more than once hinted at in the \"Origin,\" in\r\nthe passages where rudimentary organs are said to be more variable than\r\nothers, because no longer under the restraining influence of Natural\r\nSelection. And still more distinctly is this principle recognised in\r\npage 120.\r\n\r\nThus, in sending you the enclosed letter, I do not imagine that I am\r\nbringing any novel suggestions under your notice. As I see that you\r\nhave already applied the principle in question to the case of\r\nartificially-bred structures, I cannot but infer that you have pondered\r\nit in connection with naturally-bred structures. What objection,\r\nhowever, you can have seen to this principle in this latter connection,\r\nI am unable to divine; and so I think the best course for me to pursue\r\nis the one I adopt--viz., to send you my considerations in full.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of express information, the most natural inference is\r\nthat the reason you refuse to entertain the principle in question, is\r\nbecause you show the backward tendency of indiscriminate variability\r\n[to be] inadequate to contend with the conservative tendency of long\r\ninheritance. The converse of this is expressed in the words \"That the\r\nstruggle between Natural Selection on the one hand, and the tendency to\r\nreversion and variability on the other hand, will in the course of\r\ntime cease; and that the most abnormally developed organs may be made\r\nconstant, I see no reason to doubt\" (\"Origin,\" page 121). Certainly not,\r\nif, as I doubt not, the word \"constant\" is intended to bear a relative\r\nsignification; but to say that constancy can ever become absolute--i.e.,\r\nthat any term of inheritance could secure to an organ a total immunity\r\nfrom the smallest amount of spontaneous variability--to say this would\r\nbe unwarrantable. Suppose, for instance, that for some reason or other a\r\nfurther increase in the size of a bat's wing should now suddenly\r\nbecome highly beneficial to that animal: we can scarcely suppose that\r\nvariations would not be forthcoming for Natural Selection to seize upon\r\n(unless the limit of possible size has now been reached, which is an\r\naltogether distinct matter). And if we suppose that minute variations on\r\nthe side of increase are thus even now occasionally taking place, much\r\nmore is it probable that similar variations on the side of decrease are\r\nnow taking place--i.e., that if the conservative influence of Natural\r\nSelection were removed for a long period of time, more variations would\r\nensue below the present size of bat's wings, than above it. To this it\r\nmay be added, that when the influence of \"speedy selection\" is removed,\r\nit seems in itself highly probable that the structure would, for this\r\nreason, become more variable, for the only reason why it ever ceased to\r\nbe variable (i.e., after attaining its maximum size), was because of the\r\ninfluence of selection constantly destroying those individuals in which\r\na tendency to vary occurred. When, therefore, this force antagonistic\r\nto variability was removed, it seems highly probable that the latter\r\nprinciple would again begin to assert itself, and this in a cumulative\r\nmanner. Those individuals in which a tendency to vary occurred being no\r\nlonger cut off, they would have as good a chance of leaving progeny to\r\ninherit their fluctuating disposition as would their more inflexible\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 264. TO G.J. ROMANES. July 16th, 1874.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your kind and long communication, which I have\r\nread with great interest, as well as your articles in \"Nature.\" The\r\nsubject seems to me as important and interesting as it is difficult.\r\nI am much out of health, and working very hard on a very different\r\nsubject, so thus I cannot give your remarks the attention which they\r\ndeserve. I will, however, keep your letter for some later time, when I\r\nmay again take up the subject. Your letter makes it clearer to me than\r\nit ever was before, how a part or organ which has already begun from any\r\ncause to decrease, will go on decreasing through so-called spontaneous\r\nvariability, with intercrossing; for under such circumstances it is very\r\nunlikely that there should be variation in the direction of increase\r\nbeyond the average size, and no reason why there should not be\r\nvariations of decrease. I think this expresses your view. I had intended\r\nthis summer subjecting plants to [illegible] conditions, and observing\r\nthe effects on variation; but the work would be very laborious, yet I am\r\ninclined to think it will be hereafter worth the labour.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 265. TO T. MEEHAN. Down, October 9th, 1874.\r\n\r\nI am glad that you are attending to the colours of dioecious flowers;\r\nbut it is well to remember that their colours may be as unimportant to\r\nthem as those of a gall, or, indeed, as the colour of an amethyst or\r\nruby is to these gems. Some thirty years ago I began to investigate\r\nthe little purple flowers in the centre of the umbels of the carrot.\r\nI suppose my memory is wrong, but it tells me that these flowers are\r\nfemale, and I think that I once got a seed from one of them; but\r\nmy memory may be quite wrong. I hope that you will continue your\r\ninteresting researches.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 266. TO G. JAGER. Down, February 3rd, 1875.\r\n\r\nI received this morning a copy of your work \"Contra Wigand,\" either\r\nfrom yourself or from your publisher, and I am greatly obliged for\r\nit. (266/1. Jager's \"In Sachen Darwins insbesondere contra Wigand\"\r\n(Stuttgart, 1874) is directed against A. Wigand's \"Der Darwinismus\r\nund die Naturforschung Newtons und Cuviers\" (Brunswick, 1874).) I had,\r\nhowever, before bought a copy, and have sent the new one to our best\r\nlibrary, that of the Royal Society. As I am a very poor german scholar,\r\nI have as yet read only about forty pages; but these have interested\r\nme in the highest degree. Your remarks on fixed and variable species\r\ndeserve the greatest attention; but I am not at present quite convinced\r\nthat there are such independent of the conditions to which they are\r\nsubjected. I think you have done great service to the principle of\r\nevolution, which we both support, by publishing this work. I am the more\r\nglad to read it as I had not time to read Wigand's great and tedious\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 267. TO CHAUNCEY WRIGHT. Down, March 13th, 1875.\r\n\r\nI write to-day so that there shall be no delay this time in thanking you\r\nfor your interesting and long letter received this morning. I am sure\r\nthat you will excuse brevity when I tell you that I am half-killing\r\nmyself in trying to get a book ready for the press. (267/1. The MS. of\r\n\"Insectivorous Plants\" was got ready for press in March, 1875. Darwin\r\nseems to have been more than usually oppressed by the work.) I\r\nquite agree with what you say about advantages of various degrees of\r\nimportance being co-selected (267/2. Mr. Chauncey Wright wrote (February\r\n24th, 1875): \"The inquiry as to which of several real uses is the one\r\nthrough which Natural Selection has acted...has for several years seemed\r\nto me a somewhat less important question than it seemed formerly, and\r\nstill appears to most thinkers on the subject...The uses of the rattling\r\nof the rattlesnake as a protection by warning its enemies and as a\r\nsexual call are not rival uses; neither are the high-reaching and the\r\nfar-seeing uses of the giraffe's neck 'rivals.'\"), and aided by\r\nthe effects of use, etc. The subject seems to me well worth further\r\ndevelopment. I do not think I have anywhere noticed the use of the\r\neyebrows, but have long known that they protected the eyes from sweat.\r\nDuring the voyage of the \"Beagle\" one of the men ascended a lofty\r\nhill during a very hot day. He had small eyebrows, and his eyes became\r\nfearfully inflamed from the sweat running into them. The Portuguese\r\ninhabitants were familiar with this evil. I think you allude to the\r\ntransverse furrows on the forehead as a protection against sweat; but\r\nremember that these incessantly appear on the foreheads of baboons.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have been greatly pleased by the notices in the \"Nation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 268. TO A. WEISMANN. Down, May 1st, 1875.\r\n\r\nI did not receive your essay for some days after your very kind letter,\r\nand I read german so slowly that I have only just finished it. (268/1.\r\n\"Studien zur Descendenz-Theorie\" I. \"Ueber den Saison-Dimorphismus,\"\r\n1875. The fact was previously known that two forms of the genus Vanessa\r\nwhich had been considered to be distinct species are only SEASONAL forms\r\nof the same species--one appearing in spring, the other in summer. This\r\nremarkable relationship forms the subject of the essay.) Your work has\r\ninterested me greatly, and your conclusions seem well established. I\r\nhave long felt much curiosity about season-dimorphism, but never could\r\nform any theory on the subject. Undoubtedly your view is very important,\r\nas bearing on the general question of variability. When I wrote the\r\n\"Origin\" I could not find any facts which proved the direct action of\r\nclimate and other external conditions. I long ago thought that the time\r\nwould soon come when the causes of variation would be fully discussed,\r\nand no one has done so much as you in this important subject. The recent\r\nevidence of the difference between birds of the same species in the N.\r\nand S. United States well shows the power of climate. The two sexes of\r\nsome few birds are there differently modified by climate, and I have\r\nintroduced this fact in the last edition of my \"Descent of Man.\" (268/2.\r\n\"Descent of Man,\" Edition II. (in one volume), page 423. Allen showed\r\nthat many species of birds are more strongly coloured in the south of\r\nthe United States, and that sometimes one sex is more affected than\r\nthe other. It is this last point that bears on Weismann's remarks (loc.\r\ncit., pages 44, 45) on Pieris napi. The males of the alpine-boreal form\r\nbryoniae hardly differ from those of the German form (var. vernalis),\r\nwhile the females are strikingly different. Thus the character of\r\nsecondary sexual differences is determined by climate.) I am, therefore,\r\nfully prepared to admit the justness of your criticism on sexual\r\nselection of lepidoptera; but considering the display of their beauty, I\r\nam not yet inclined to think that I am altogether in error.\r\n\r\nWhat you say about reversion (268/3. For instance, the fact that\r\nreversion to the primary winter-form may be produced by the disturbing\r\neffect of high temperature (page 7).) being excited by various causes,\r\nagrees with what I concluded with respect to the remarkable effects\r\nof crossing two breeds: namely, that anything which disturbs the\r\nconstitution leads to reversion, or, as I put the case under my\r\nhypothesis of pangenesis, gives a good chance of latent gemmules\r\ndeveloping. Your essay, in my opinion, is an admirable one, and I thank\r\nyou for the interest which it has afforded me.\r\n\r\nP.S. I find that there are several points, which I have forgotten. Mr.\r\nJenner Weir has not published anything more about caterpillars, but\r\nI have written to him, asking him whether he has tried any more\r\nexperiments, and will keep back this letter till I receive his answer.\r\nMr. Riley of the United States supports Mr. Weir, and you will\r\nfind reference to him and other papers at page 426 of the new and\r\nmuch-corrected edition of my \"Descent of Man.\" As I have a duplicate\r\ncopy of Volume I. (I believe Volume II. is not yet published in german)\r\nI send it to you by this post. Mr. Belt, in his travels in Nicaragua,\r\ngives several striking cases of conspicuously coloured animals (but not\r\ncaterpillars) which are distasteful to birds of prey: he is an excellent\r\nobserver, and his book, \"The Naturalist in Nicaragua,\" very interesting.\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your photograph, which I am particularly glad\r\nto possess, and I send mine in return.\r\n\r\nI see you allude to Hilgendorf's statements, which I was sorry to\r\nsee disputed by some good German observer. Mr. Hyatt, an excellent\r\npalaeontologist of the United States, visited the place, and likewise\r\nassured me that Hilgendorf was quite mistaken. (268/4. See Letters\r\n252-7.)\r\n\r\nI am grieved to hear that your eyesight still continues bad, but anyhow\r\nit has forced your excellent work in your last essay.\r\n\r\nMay 4th. Here is what Mr. Weir says:--\r\n\r\n\"In reply to your inquiry of Saturday, I regret that I have little\r\nto add to my two communications to the 'Entomological Society\r\nTransactions.'\r\n\r\n\"I repeated the experiments with gaudy caterpillars for years, and\r\nalways with the same results: not on a single occasion did I find richly\r\ncoloured, conspicuous larvae eaten by birds. It was more remarkable\r\nto observe that the birds paid not the slightest attention to gaudy\r\ncaterpillars, not even when in motion,--the experiments so thoroughly\r\nsatisfied my mind that I have now given up making them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 269. TO LAWSON TAIT.\r\n\r\n(269/1. The late Mr. Lawson Tait wrote to Mr. Darwin (June 2nd, 1875):\r\n\"I am watching a lot of my mice from whom I removed the tails at birth,\r\nand I am coming to the conclusion that the essential use of the tail\r\nthere is as a recording organ--that is, they record in their memories\r\nthe corners they turn and the height of the holes they pass through by\r\ntouching them with their tails.\" Mr. Darwin was interested in the idea\r\nbecause \"some German sneered at Natural Selection and instanced the\r\ntails of mice.\")\r\n\r\nJune 11th, 1875.\r\n\r\nIt has just occurred to me to look at the \"Origin of Species\" (Edition\r\nVI., page 170), and it is certain that Bronn, in the appended chapter\r\nto his translation of my book into german, did advance ears and tail of\r\nvarious species of mice as a difficulty opposed to Natural Selection. I\r\nanswered with respect to ears by alluding to Schobl's curious paper (I\r\nforget when published) (269/2. J. Schobl, \"Das aussere Ohr der Mause als\r\nwichtiges Tastorgan.\" \"Archiv. Mik. Anat.\" VII., 1871, page 260.) on the\r\nhairs of the ears being sensitive and provided with nerves. I presume\r\nhe made fine sections: if you are accustomed to such histological work,\r\nwould it not be worth while to examine hairs of tail of mice? At page\r\n189 I quote Henslow (confirmed by Gunther) on Mus messorius (and other\r\nspecies?) using tail as prehensile organ.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane in his account of the second Grinnell Expedition says that the\r\nEsquimaux in severe weather carry a fox-tail tied to the neck, which\r\nthey use as a respirator by holding the tip of the tail between their\r\nteeth. (269/3. The fact is stated in Volume II., page 24, of E.K. Kane's\r\n\"Arctic Explorations: The Second Grinnell Expedition in Search of Sir\r\nJohn Franklin.\" Philadelphia, 1856.)\r\n\r\nHe says also that he found a frozen fox curled up with his nose buried\r\nin his tail.\r\n\r\nN.B. It is just possible that the latter fact is stated by M'Clintock,\r\nnot by Dr. Kane.\r\n\r\n(269/4. The final passage is a postscript by Mr. W.E. Darwin bearing on\r\nMr. Lawson Tait's idea of the respirator function of the fox's tail.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 270. TO G.J. ROMANES. Down, July 12th, 1875.\r\n\r\nI am correcting a second edition of \"Variation under Domestication,\" and\r\nfind that I must do it pretty fully. Therefore I give a short abstract\r\nof potato graft-hybrids, and I want to know whether I did not send you a\r\nreference about beet. Did you look to this, and can you tell me anything\r\nabout it?\r\n\r\nI hope with all my heart that you are getting on pretty well with your\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nI have been led to think a good deal on the subject, and am convinced\r\nof its high importance, though it will take years of hammering before\r\nphysiologists will admit that the sexual organs only collect the\r\ngenerative elements.\r\n\r\nThe edition will be published in November, and then you will see\r\nall that I have collected, but I believe that you gave all the more\r\nimportant cases. The case of vine in \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" which I\r\nsent you, I think may only be a bud-variation not due to grafting. I\r\nhave heard indirectly of your splendid success with nerves of medusae.\r\nWe have been at Abinger Hall for a month for rest, which I much\r\nrequired, and I saw there the cut-leaved vine which seems splendid for\r\ngraft hybridism.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 271. TO FRANCIS GALTON. Down, November 7th, 1875.\r\n\r\nI have read your essay with much curiosity and interest, but you\r\nprobably have no idea how excessively difficult it is to understand.\r\n(271/1. \"A Theory of Heredity\" (\"Journal of the Anthropological\r\nInstitute,\" 1875). In this paper Mr. Galton admits that the hypothesis\r\nof organic units \"must lie at the foundation of the science of\r\nheredity,\" and proceeds to show in what respect his conception differs\r\nfrom the hypothesis of pangenesis. The copy of Mr. Galton's paper, which\r\nDarwin numbered in correspondence with the criticisms in his letter, is\r\nnot available, and we are therefore only able to guess at some of\r\nthe points referred to.) I cannot fully grasp, only here and there\r\nconjecture, what are the points on which we differ. I daresay this is\r\nchiefly due to muddy-headedness on my part, but I do not think wholly\r\nso. Your many terms, not defined, \"developed germs,\" \"fertile,\" and\r\n\"sterile germs\" (the word \"germ\" itself from association misleading to\r\nme) \"stirp,\" \"sept,\" \"residue,\" etc., etc., quite confounded me. If I\r\nask myself how you derive, and where you place the innumerable gemmules\r\ncontained within the spermatozoa formed by a male animal during its\r\nwhole life, I cannot answer myself. Unless you can make several parts\r\nclearer I believe (though I hope I am altogether wrong) that only a few\r\nwill endeavour or succeed in fathoming your meaning. I have marked a\r\nfew passages with numbers, and here make a few remarks and express my\r\nopinion, as you desire it, not that I suppose it will be of any use to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n1. If this implies that many parts are not modified by use and disuse\r\nduring the life of the individual, I differ widely from you, as every\r\nyear I come to attribute more and more to such agency. (271/2. This\r\nseems to refer to page 329 of Mr. Galton's paper. The passage must have\r\nbeen hastily read, and has been quite misunderstood. Mr. Galton has\r\nnever expressed the view attributed to him.)\r\n\r\n2. This seems rather bold, as sexuality has not been detected in some\r\nof the lowest forms, though I daresay it may hereafter be. (271/3. Mr.\r\nGalton, op. cit., pages 332-3: \"There are not of a necessity two\r\nsexes, because swarms of creatures of the simplest organisations mainly\r\nmultiply by some process of self-division.\")\r\n\r\n3. If gemmules (to use my own term) were often deficient in buds, I\r\ncannot but think that bud-variations would be commoner than they are in\r\na state of nature; nor does it seem that bud-variations often exhibit\r\ndeficiencies which might be accounted for by the absence of the proper\r\ngemmules. I take a very different view of the meaning or cause of\r\nsexuality. (271/4. Mr. Galton's idea is that in a bud or other\r\nasexually produced part, the germs (i.e. gemmules) may not be completely\r\nrepresentative of the whole organism, and if reproduction is continued\r\nasexually \"at each successive stage there is always a chance of some one\r\nor more of the various species of germs... dying out\" (page 333). Mr.\r\nGalton supposes, in sexual reproduction, where two parents contribute\r\ngerms to the embryo the chance of deficiency of any of the necessary\r\ngerms is greatly diminished. Darwin's \"very different view of the\r\nmeaning or cause of sexuality\" is no doubt that given in \"Cross and\r\nSelf Fertilisation\"--i.e., that sexuality is equivalent to changed\r\nconditions, that the parents are not representative of different sexes,\r\nbut of different conditions of life.)\r\n\r\n4. I have ordered \"Fraser's Magazine\" (271/5. \"The History of Twins,\"\r\nby F. Galton, \"Fraser's Magazine,\" November, 1875, republished with\r\nadditions in the \"Journal of the Anthropological Institute,\" 1875. Mr.\r\nGalton explains the striking dissimilarity of twins which is sometimes\r\nmet with by supposing that the offspring in this case divide the\r\navailable gemmules between them in such a way that each is the\r\ncomplement of the other. Thus, to put the case in an exaggerated way,\r\nsimilar twins would each have half the gemmules A, B, C,...Z., etc,\r\nwhereas, in the case of dissimilar twins, one would have all the\r\ngemmules A, B, C, D,...M, and the other would have N...Z.), and am\r\ncurious to learn how twins from a single ovum are distinguished from\r\ntwins from two ova. Nothing seems to me more curious than the similarity\r\nand dissimilarity of twins.\r\n\r\n5. Awfully difficult to understand.\r\n\r\n6. I have given almost the same notion.\r\n\r\n7. I hope that all this will be altered. I have received new and\r\nadditional cases, so that I have now not a shadow of doubt.\r\n\r\n8. Such cases can hardly be spoken of as very rare, as you would say if\r\nyou had received half the number of cases I have.\r\n\r\n(271/6. We are unable to determine to what paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8 refer.)\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to differ so much from you, but I have thought that you\r\nwould desire my open opinion. Frank is away, otherwise he should have\r\ncopied my scrawl.\r\n\r\nI have got a good stock of pods of sweet peas, but the autumn has been\r\nfrightfully bad; perhaps we may still get a few more to ripen.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 272. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, November 12th [1875].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your \"Biology,\" which I have read. (272/1. \"A Course of\r\nPractical Instruction in Elementary Biology,\" by T.H. Huxley and H.N.\r\nMartin, 1875. For an account of the book see \"Life and Letters of T.H.\r\nHuxley,\" Volume I., page 380.) It was a real stroke of genius to think\r\nof such a plan. Lord, how I wish I had gone through such a course!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 273. TO FRANCIS GALTON. December 18th [1875].\r\n\r\nGeorge has been explaining our differences.

This\r\nis a curious mistake; the letter in \"Nature,\" April 27th, 1871, is by\r\nDarwin himself, and refers chiefly to the question whether gemmules may\r\nbe supposed to be in the blood. Mr. Galton's letter is in \"Nature,\"\r\nMay 4th, 1871, Volume IV., page 5. See Letter 235.) (before seeing\r\nyour essay) that perhaps the gemmules are largely multiplied in the\r\nreproductive organs; but this does not make me doubt that each unit of\r\nthe whole system also sends forth its gemmules. You will no doubt have\r\nthought of the following objection to your views, and I should like to\r\nhear what your answer is. If two plants are crossed, it often, or rather\r\ngenerally, happens that every part of stem, leaf, even to the hairs,\r\nand flowers of the hybrid are intermediate in character; and this hybrid\r\nwill produce by buds millions on millions of other buds all exactly\r\nreproducing the intermediate character. I cannot doubt that every unit\r\nof the hybrid is hybridised and sends forth hybridised gemmules. Here we\r\nhave nothing to do with the reproductive organs. There can hardly be a\r\ndoubt from what we know that the same thing would occur with all those\r\nanimals which are capable of budding, and some of these (as the compound\r\nAscidians) are sufficiently complex and highly organised.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 274. TO LAWSON TAIT. March 25th, 1876.\r\n\r\n(274/1. The reference is to the theory put forward in the first edition\r\nof \"Variation of Animals and Plants,\" II., page 15, that the asserted\r\ntendency to regeneration after the amputation of supernumerary digits\r\nin man is a return to the recuperative powers characteristic of a \"lowly\r\norganised progenitor provided with more than five digits.\" Darwin's\r\nrecantation is at Volume I., page 459 of the second edition.)\r\n\r\nSince reading your first article (274/2. Lawson Tait wrote two notices\r\non \"The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication\" in the\r\n\"Spectator\" of March 4th, 1876, page 312, and March 25th, page 406.),\r\nDr. Rudinger has written to me and sent me an essay, in which he gives\r\nthe results of the MOST EXTENSIVE inquiries from all eminent surgeons\r\nin Germany, and all are unanimous about non-growth of extra digits after\r\namputation. They explain some apparent cases, as Paget did to me. By the\r\nway, I struck out of my second edition a quotation from Sir J. Simpson\r\nabout re-growth in the womb, as Paget demurred, and as I could not say\r\nhow a rudiment of a limb due to any cause could be distinguished from\r\nan imperfect re-growth. Two or three days ago I had another letter from\r\nGermany from a good naturalist, Dr. Kollmann (274/3. Dr. Kollmann was\r\nSecretary of the Anthropologische Gesellschaft of Munich, in which\r\nSociety took place the discussion referred to in \"Variation of Animals\r\nand Plants,\" I., 459, as originating Darwin's doubts on the whole\r\nquestion. The fresh evidence adduced by Kollmann as to the normal\r\noccurrence of a rudimentary sixth digit in Batrachians is Borus' paper,\r\n\"Die sechste Zehe der Anuren\" in \"Morpholog. Jahrbuch,\" Bd. I., page\r\n435. On this subject see Letter 178.), saying he was sorry that I\r\nhad given up atavism and extra digits, and telling me of new and good\r\nevidence of rudiments of a rudimentary sixth digit in Batrachians (which\r\nI had myself seen, but given up owing to Gegenbaur's views); but, with\r\nre-growth failing me, I could not uphold my old notion.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 275. TO G.J. ROMANES.\r\n\r\n(275/1. Mr. Romanes' reply to this letter is printed in his \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" page 93, where by an oversight it is dated 1880-81.)\r\n\r\nH. Wedgwood, Esq., Hopedene, Dorking, May 29th [1876].\r\n\r\nAs you are interested in pangenesis, and will some day, I hope, convert\r\nan \"airy nothing\" into a substantial theory, I send by this post\r\nan essay by Hackel (275/2. \"Die Perigenesis der Plastidule oder die\r\nWellenzeugung der Lebenstheilchen,\" 79 pages. Berlin, 1876.) attacking\r\nPan. and substituting a molecular hypothesis. If I understand his views\r\nrightly, he would say that with a bird which strengthened its wings by\r\nuse, the formative protoplasm of the strengthened parts became changed,\r\nand its molecular vibrations consequently changed, and that these\r\nvibrations are transmitted throughout the whole frame of the bird,\r\nand affect the sexual elements in such a manner that the wings of the\r\noffspring are developed in a like strengthened manner. I imagine he\r\nwould say, in cases like those of Lord Morton's mare (275/3. A\r\nnearly pure-bred Arabian chestnut mare bore a hybrid to a quagga, and\r\nsubsequently produced two striped colts by a black Arabian horse: see\r\n\"Animals and Plants,\" I., page 403. The case was originally described\r\nin the \"Philosophical Transactions,\" 1821, page 20. For an account of\r\nrecent work bearing on this question, see article on \"Zebras, Horses,\r\nand Hybrids,\" in the \"Quarterly Review,\" October 1899. See Letter 235.),\r\nthat the vibrations from the protoplasm, or \"plasson,\" of the seminal\r\nfluid of the zebra set plasson vibrating in the mare; and that these\r\nvibrations continued until the hair of the second colt was formed, and\r\nwhich consequently became barred like that of a zebra. How he explains\r\nreversion to a remote ancestor, I know not. Perhaps I have misunderstood\r\nhim, though I have skimmed the whole with some care. He lays much stress\r\non inheritance being a form of unconscious memory, but how far this is\r\npart of his molecular vibration, I do not understand. His views make\r\nnothing clearer to me; but this may be my fault. No one, I presume,\r\nwould doubt about molecular movements of some kind. His essay is clever\r\nand striking. If you read it (but you must not on my account), I should\r\nmuch like to hear your judgment, and you can return it at any time. The\r\nblue lines are Hackel's to call my attention.\r\n\r\nWe have come here for rest for me, which I have much needed; and shall\r\nremain here for about ten days more, and then home to work, which is\r\nmy sole pleasure in life. I hope your splendid Medusa work and your\r\nexperiments on pangenesis are going on well. I heard from my son Frank\r\nyesterday that he was feverish with a cold, and could not dine with the\r\nphysiologists, which I am very sorry for, as I should have heard what\r\nthey think about the new Bill. I see that you are one of the secretaries\r\nto this young Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 276. TO H.N. MOSELEY. Down, November 22nd [1876].\r\n\r\nIt is very kind of you to send me the Japanese books, which are\r\nextremely curious and amusing. My son Frank is away, but I am sure he\r\nwill be much obliged for the two papers which you have sent him.\r\n\r\nThanks, also, for your interesting note. It is a pity that Peripatus\r\n(276/1. Moseley \"On the Structure and Development of Peripatus capensis\"\r\n(\"Phil. Trans. R. Soc.\" Volume 164, page 757, 1874). \"When suddenly\r\nhandled or irritated, they (i.e. Peripatus) shoot out fine threads of a\r\nremarkably viscid and tenacious milky fluid... projected from the tips\r\nof the oral papillae\" (page 759).) is so stupid as to spit out the\r\nviscid matter at the wrong end of its body; it would have been beautiful\r\nthus to have explained the origin of the spider's web.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 277. NAPHTALI LEWY TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(277/1. The following letter refers to a book, \"Toledoth Adam,\" written\r\nby a learned Jew with the object of convincing his co-religionists of\r\nthe truth of the theory of evolution. The translation we owe to the\r\nlate Henry Bradshaw, University Librarian at Cambridge. The book is\r\nunfortunately no longer to be found in Mr. Darwin's library.)\r\n\r\n[1876].\r\n\r\nTo the Lord, the Prince, who \"stands for an ensign of the people\" (Isa.\r\nxi. 10), the Investigator of the generation, the \"bright son of the\r\nmorning\" (Isa. xiv. 12), Charles Darwin, may he live long!\r\n\r\n\"From the rising of the sun and from the west\" (Isa. xlv. 6) all the\r\nnations know concerning the Torah (Theory) (277/2. Lit., instruction.\r\nThe Torah is the Pentateuch, strictly speaking, the source of all\r\nknowledge.) which has \"proceeded from thee for a light of the people\"\r\n(Isa. li. 4), and the nations \"hear and say, It is truth\" (Isa. xliii.\r\n9). But with \"the portion of my people\" (Jer. x. 16), Jacob, \"the lot\r\nof my inheritance\" (Deut. xxxii. 9), it is not so. This nation, \"the\r\nancient people\" (Isa. xliv. 7), which \"remembers the former things and\r\nconsiders the things of old (Isa. xliii. 18), \"knows not, neither doth\r\nit understand\" (Psalm lxxxii. 5), that by thy Torah (instruction or\r\ntheory) thou hast thrown light upon their Torah (the Law), and that the\r\neyes of the Hebrews (277/3. One letter in this word changed would make\r\nthe word \"blind,\" which is what Isaiah uses in the passage alluded to.)\r\n\"can now see out of obscurity and out of darkness\" (Isa. xxix. 18).\r\nTherefore \"I arose\" (Judges v. 7) and wrote this book, \"Toledoth Adam\"\r\n(\"the generations of man,\" Gen. v. 1), to teach the children of my\r\npeople, the seed of Jacob, the Torah (instruction) which thou hast given\r\nfor an inheritance to all the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd I have \"proceeded to do a marvellous work among this people, even a\r\nmarvellous work and a wonder\" (Isa. xxix. 14), enabling them now to read\r\nin the Torah of Moses our teacher, \"plainly and giving the sense\"\r\n(Neh. viii. 8), that which thou hast given in thy Torahs (works of\r\ninstruction). And when my people perceive that thy view has by no means\r\n\"gone astray\" (Num. v. 12, 19, etc.) from the Torah of God, they will\r\nhold thy name in the highest reverence, and \"will at the same time\r\nglorify the God of Israel\" (Isa. xxix. 23).\r\n\r\n\"The vision of all this\" (Isa. xxix. 11) thou shalt see, O Prince of\r\nWisdom, in this book, \"which goeth before me\" (Gen. xxxii. 21); and\r\nwhatever thy large understanding finds to criticise in it, come, \"write\r\nit in a table and note it in a book\" (Isa. xxx. 8); and allow me to name\r\nmy work with thy name, which is glorified and greatly revered by\r\n\r\nThy servant, Naphtali Hallevi [i.e. the Levite].\r\n\r\nDated here in the city of Radom, in the province of Poland, in the month\r\nof Nisan in the year 636, according to the lesser computation (i.e. A.M.\r\n[5]636 = A.D. 1876).\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 278. TO OTTO ZACHARIAS. 1877.\r\n\r\nWhen I was on board the \"Beagle\" I believed in the permanence of\r\nspecies, but, as far as I can remember, vague doubts occasionally\r\nflitted across my mind. On my return home in the autumn of 1836 I\r\nimmediately began to prepare my journal for publication, and then saw\r\nhow many facts indicated the common descent of species (278/1. \"The\r\nfacts to which reference is here made were, without doubt, eminently\r\nfitted to attract the attention of a philosophical thinker; but until\r\nthe relations of the existing with the extinct species and of the\r\nspecies of the different geographical areas, with one another were\r\ndetermined with some exactness, they afforded but an unsafe foundation\r\nfor speculation. It was not possible that this determination should have\r\nbeen effected before the return of the \"Beagle\" to England; and thus the\r\ndate which Darwin (writing in 1837) assigns to the dawn of the new light\r\nwhich was rising in his mind becomes intelligible.\"--From \"Darwiniana,\"\r\nEssays by Thomas H. Huxley, London, 1893; pages 274-5.), so that in\r\nJuly, 1837, I opened a notebook to record any facts which might bear on\r\nthe question; but I did not become convinced that species were mutable\r\nuntil, I think, two or three years had elapsed. (278/2. On this last\r\npoint see page 38.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 279. TO G.J. ROMANES.\r\n\r\n(279/1. The following letter refers to MS. notes by Romanes, which we\r\nhave not seen. Darwin's remarks on it are, however, sufficiently clear.)\r\n\r\nMy address will be \"Bassett, Southampton,\" June 11th [1877].\r\n\r\nI have received the crossing paper which you were so kind as to send me.\r\nIt is very clear, and I quite agree with it; but the point in question\r\nhas not been a difficulty to me, as I have never believed in a new form\r\noriginating from a single variation. What I have called unconscious\r\nselection by man illustrates, as it seems to me, the same principle as\r\nyours, within the same area. Man purchases the individual animals or\r\nplants which seem to him the best in any respect--some more so, and some\r\nless so--and, without any matching or pairing, the breed in the\r\ncourse of time is surely altered. The absence in numerous instances\r\nof intermediate or blending forms, in the border country between two\r\nclosely allied geographical races or close species, seemed to me a\r\ngreater difficulty when I discussed the subject in the \"Origin.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to your illustration, it formerly drove me half mad to\r\nattempt to account for the increase or diminution of the productiveness\r\nof an organism; but I cannot call to mind where my difficulty lay.\r\n(279/2. See Letters 209-16.) Natural Selection always applies, as I\r\nthink, to each individual and its offspring, such as its seeds, eggs,\r\nwhich are formed by the mother, and which are protected in various ways.\r\n(279/3. It was in regard to this point that Romanes had sent the MS. to\r\nDarwin. In a letter of June 16th he writes: \"It was with reference\r\nto the possibility of Natural Selection acting on organic types as\r\ndistinguished from individuals,--a possibility which you once told\r\nme did not seem at all clear.\") There does not seem any difficulty in\r\nunderstanding how the productiveness of an organism might be increased;\r\nbut it was, as far as I can remember, in reducing productiveness that I\r\nwas most puzzled. But why I scribble about this I know not.\r\n\r\nI have read your review of Mr. Allen's book (279/4. See \"Nature\"\r\n(June 7th, 1877, page 98), a review of Grant Allen's \"Physiological\r\nAesthetics.\"), and it makes me more doubtful, even, than I was before\r\nwhether he has really thrown much light on the subject.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that some physiologists take the same view as I did\r\nabout your giving too much credit to H. Spencer--though, heaven knows,\r\nthis is a rare fault. (279/5. The reference is to Romanes' lecture on\r\nMedusa, given at the Royal Institution, May 25th. (See \"Nature,\" XVI.,\r\npages 231, 269, 289.) It appears from a letter of Romanes (June 6th)\r\nthat it was the abstract in the \"Times\" that gave the impression\r\nreferred to. References to Mr. Spencer's theories of nerve-genesis occur\r\nin \"Nature,\" pages 232, 271, 289.)\r\n\r\nThe more I think of your medusa-nerve-work the more splendid it seems to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 280. TO A. DE CANDOLLE. Down, August 3rd, 1877.\r\n\r\nI must have the pleasure of thanking you for your long and interesting\r\nletter. The cause and means of the transition from an hermaphrodite to\r\na unisexual condition seems to me a very perplexing problem, and I shall\r\nbe extremely glad to read your remarks on Smilax, whenever I receive the\r\nessay which you kindly say that you will send me. (280/1. \"Monographiae\r\nPhanerogamarum,\" Volume I. In his treatment of the Smilaceae, De\r\nCandolle distinguishes:--Heterosmilax which has dioecious flowers\r\nwithout a trace of aborted stamens or pistils, Smilax with sterile\r\nstamens in the female flowers, and Rhipogonum with hermaphrodite\r\nflowers.) There is much justice in your criticisms (280/2. The passage\r\ncriticised by De Candolle is in \"Forms of Flowers\" (page 7): \"It is a\r\nnatural inference that their corollas have been increased in size for\r\nthis special purpose.\" De Candolle goes on to give an account of the\r\n\"recherche linguistique,\" which, with characteristic fairness, he\r\nundertook to ascertain whether the word \"purpose\" differs in meaning\r\nfrom the corresponding French word \"but.\") on my use of the terms\r\nobject, end, purpose; but those who believe that organs have been\r\ngradually modified for Natural Selection for a special purpose may,\r\nI think, use the above terms correctly, though no conscious being has\r\nintervened. I have found much difficulty in my occasional attempts\r\nto avoid these terms, but I might perhaps have always spoken of a\r\nbeneficial or serviceable effect. My son Francis will be interested by\r\nhearing about Smilax. He has dispatched to you a copy of his paper on\r\nthe glands of Dipsacus (280/3. \"Quart. Journ. Mic. Sci.\" 1877.), and I\r\nhope that you will find time to read it, for the case seems to me a new\r\nand highly remarkable one. We are now hard at work on an attempt to make\r\nout the function or use of the bloom or waxy secretion on the leaves and\r\nfruit of many plants; but I doubt greatly whether our experiments will\r\ntell us much. (280/4. \"As it is we have made out clearly that with\r\nsome plants (chiefly succulent) the bloom checks evaporation--with\r\nsome certainly prevents attacks of insects; with some sea-shore plants\r\nprevents injury from salt-water, and I believe, with a few prevents\r\ninjury from pure water resting on the leaves.\" (See letter to Sir W.\r\nThiselton-Dyer, \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 341. A paper on the\r\nsame subject by Francis Darwin was published in the \"Journ. Linn.\r\nSoc.\" XXII.)) If you have any decided opinion whether plants with\r\nconspicuously glaucous leaves are more frequent in hot than in temperate\r\nor cold, in dry than in damp countries, I should be grateful if you\r\nwould add to your many kindnesses by informing me. Pray give my kind\r\nremembrances to your son, and tell him that my son has been trying on\r\na large scale the effects of feeding Drosera with meat, and the results\r\nare most striking and far more favourable than I anticipated.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 281. TO G.J. ROMANES.\r\n\r\n(281/1. Published in the \"Life and Letters\" of Romanes, page 66.)\r\n\r\nDown, Saturday Night [1877].\r\n\r\nI have just finished your lecture (281/2. \"The Scientific Evidence of\r\nOrganic Evolution: a Discourse\" (delivered before the Philosophical\r\nSociety of Ross-shire), Inverness, 1877. It was reprinted in the\r\n\"Fortnightly Review,\" and was afterwards worked up into a book under\r\nthe above title.); it is an admirable scientific argument, and most\r\npowerful. I wish that it could be sown broadcast throughout the land.\r\nYour courage is marvellous, and I wonder that you were not stoned on\r\nthe spot--and in Scotland! Do please tell me how it was received in the\r\nLecture Hall. About man being made like a monkey (page 37 (281/3. \"And\r\nif you reject the natural explanation of hereditary descent, you can\r\nonly suppose that the Deity, in creating man, took the most scrupulous\r\npains to make him in the image of the ape\" (\"Discourse,\" page 37).)) is\r\nquite new to me, and the argument in an earlier place (page 8 (281/4.\r\nAt page 8 of the \"Discourse\" the speaker referred to the law \"which Sir\r\nWilliam Hamilton called the Law of Parsimony--or the law which forbids\r\nus to assume the operation of higher causes when lower ones are found\r\nsufficient to explain the desired effects,\" as constituting the \"only\r\nlogical barrier between Science and Superstition.\")) on the law of\r\nparsimony admirably put. Yes, page 21 (281/5. \"Discourse,\" page 21. If\r\nwe accept the doctrines of individual creations and ideal types, we\r\nmust believe that the Deity acted \"with no other apparent motive than\r\nto suggest to us, by every one of the observable facts, that the ideal\r\ntypes are nothing other than the bonds of a lineal descent.\") is new to\r\nme. All strike me as very clear, and, considering small space, you have\r\nchosen your lines of reasoning excellently.\r\n\r\nThe few last pages are awfully powerful, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nSunday Morning.--The above was written last night in the enthusiasm of\r\nthe moment, and now--this dark, dismal Sunday morning--I fully agree\r\nwith what I said.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to hear about the failures in the graft experiments, and\r\nnot from your own fault or ill-luck. Trollope in one of his novels gives\r\nas a maxim of constant use by a brickmaker--\"It is dogged as does it\"\r\n(281/6. \"Tell 'ee what, Master Crawley;--and yer reverence mustn't think\r\nas I means to be preaching; there ain't nowt a man can't bear if he'll\r\nonly be dogged. You go whome, Master Crawley, and think o' that, and\r\nmay be it'll do ye a good yet. It's dogged as does it. It ain't thinking\r\nabout it.\" (Giles Hoggett, the old Brickmaker, in \"The Last Chronicle\r\nof Barset,\" Volume II., 1867, page 188.))--and I have often and often\r\nthought that this is the motto for every scientific worker. I am sure it\r\nis yours--if you do not give up pangenesis with wicked imprecations.\r\n\r\nBy the way, G. Jager has brought out in \"Kosmos\" a chemical sort of\r\npangenesis bearing chiefly on inheritance. (281/7. Several papers by\r\nJager on \"Inheritance\" were published in the first volume of \"Kosmos,\"\r\n1877.)\r\n\r\nI cannot conceive why I have not offered my garden for your experiments.\r\nI would attend to the plants, as far as mere care goes, with pleasure;\r\nbut Down is an awkward place to reach.\r\n\r\nWould it be worth while to try if the \"Fortnightly\" would republish it\r\n[i.e. the lecture]?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 282. TO T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n(282/1. In 1877 the honorary degree of LL.D. was conferred on Mr. Darwin\r\nby the University of Cambridge. At the dinner given on the occasion\r\nby the Philosophical Society, Mr. Huxley responded to the toast of the\r\nevening with the speech of which an authorised version is given by Mr.\r\nL. Huxley in the \"Life and Letters\" of his father (Volume I., page 479).\r\nMr. Huxley said, \"But whether the that doctrine [of evolution] be true\r\nor whether it be false, I wish to express the deliberate opinion, that\r\nfrom Aristotle's great summary of the biological knowledge of his time\r\ndown to the present day, there is nothing comparable to the \"Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" as a connected survey of the phenomena of life permeated and\r\nvivified by a central idea.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the speech there was a brilliant sentence which he\r\ndescribed as a touch of the whip \"tied round with ribbons,\" and this was\r\nperhaps a little hard on the supporters of evolution in the University.\r\nMr. Huxley said \"Instead of offering her honours when they ran a chance\r\nof being crushed beneath the accumulated marks of approbation of the\r\nwhole civilised world, the University has waited until the trophy\r\nwas finished, and has crowned the edifice with the delicate wreath of\r\nacademic appreciation.\")\r\n\r\nDown, Monday night, November 19th [1877].\r\n\r\nI cannot rest easy without telling you more gravely than I did when we\r\nmet for five minutes near the Museum, how deeply I have felt the many\r\ngenerous things (as far as Frank could remember them) which you said\r\nabout me at the dinner. Frank came early next morning boiling over with\r\nenthusiasm about your speech. You have indeed always been to me a most\r\ngenerous friend, but I know, alas, too well how greatly you overestimate\r\nme. Forgive me for bothering you with these few lines.\r\n\r\n(282/2. The following extract from a letter (February 10th, 1878) to his\r\nold schoolfellow, Mr. J. Price, gives a characteristic remark about the\r\nhonorary degree.)\r\n\r\n\"I am very much obliged for your kind congratulations about the LL.D.\r\nWhy the Senate conferred it on me I know not in the least. I was\r\nastonished to hear that the R. Prof. of Divinity and several other great\r\nDons attended, and several such men have subscribed, as I am informed,\r\nfor the picture for the University to commemorate the honour conferred\r\non me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 283. TO W. BOWMAN.\r\n\r\n(283/1. We have not discovered to what prize the following letter to the\r\nlate Sir W. Bowman (the well known surgeon) refers.)\r\n\r\nDown, February 22nd, 1878.\r\n\r\nI received your letter this morning, and it was quite impossible that\r\nyou should receive an answer by 4 p.m. to-day. But this does not signify\r\nin the least, for your proposal seems to me a very good one, and I most\r\nentirely agree with you that it is far better to suggest some special\r\nquestion rather than to have a general discussion compiled from\r\nbooks. The rule that the Essay must be \"illustrative of the wisdom and\r\nbeneficence of the Almighty\" would confine the subjects to be proposed.\r\nWith respect to the Vegetable Kingdom, I could suggest two or three\r\nsubjects about which, as it seems to me, information is much required;\r\nbut these subjects would require a long course of experiment, and\r\nunfortunately there is hardly any one in this country who seems inclined\r\nto devote himself to experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 284. TO J. TORBITT.\r\n\r\n(284/1. Mr. Torbitt was engaged in trying to produce by methodical\r\nselection and cross-fertilisation a fungus-proof race of the potato. The\r\nplan is fully described in the \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 348.\r\nThe following letter is given in additional illustration of the keen\r\ninterest Mr. Darwin took in the project.)\r\n\r\nDown, Monday, March 4th, 1878.\r\n\r\nI have nothing good to report. Mr. Caird called upon me yesterday;\r\nboth he and Mr. Farrer (284/2. The late Lord Farrer.) have been\r\nmost energetic and obliging. There is no use in thinking about the\r\nAgricultural Society. Mr. Caird has seen several persons on the subject,\r\nespecially Mr. Carruthers, Botanist to the Society. He (Mr. Carruthers)\r\nthinks the attempt hopeless, but advances in a long memorandum sent to\r\nMr. Caird, reasons which I am convinced are not sound. He specifies two\r\npoints, however, which are well worthy of your consideration--namely,\r\nthat a variety should be tested three years before its soundness can\r\nbe trusted; and especially it should be grown under a damp climate. Mr.\r\nCarruthers' opinion on this head is valuable because he was employed\r\nby the Society in judging the varieties sent in for the prize offered a\r\nyear or two ago. If I had strength to get up a memorial to Government, I\r\nbelieve that I could succeed; for Sir J. Hooker writes that he believes\r\nyou are on the right path; but I do not know to whom else to apply\r\nwhose judgment would have weight with Government, and I really have not\r\nstrength to discuss the matter and convert persons.\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Farrer's request, when we hoped the Agricultural Society might\r\nundertake it, I wrote to him a long letter giving him my opinion on the\r\nsubject; and this letter Mr. Caird took with him yesterday, and\r\nwill consider with Mr. Farrer whether any application can be made to\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nI am, however, far from sanguine. I shall see Mr. Farrer this evening,\r\nand will do what I can. When I receive back my letter I will send it to\r\nyou for your perusal.\r\n\r\nAfter much reflection it seems to me that your best plan will be, if\r\nwe fail to get Government aid, to go on during the present year, on a\r\nreduced scale, in raising new cross-fertilised varieties, and next\r\nyear, if you are able, testing the power of endurance of only the most\r\npromising kind. If it were possible it would be very advisable for you\r\nto get some grown on the wet western side of Ireland. If you succeed\r\nin procuring a fungus-proof variety you may rely on it that its merits\r\nwould soon become known locally and it would afterwards spread rapidly\r\nfar and wide. Mr. Caird gave me a striking instance of such a case in\r\nScotland. I return home to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure to enclose a cheque for 100 pounds. If you receive a\r\nGovernment grant, I ought to be repaid.\r\n\r\nP.S. If I were in your place I would not expend any labour or money in\r\npublishing what you have already done, or in sending seeds or tubers to\r\nany one. I would work quietly on till some sure results were obtained.\r\nAnd these would be so valuable that your work in this case would soon be\r\nknown. I would also endeavour to pass as severe a judgment as possible\r\non the state of the tubers and plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 285. TO E. VON MOJSISOVICS. Down, June 1st, 1878.\r\n\r\nI have at last found time to read [the] first chapter of your \"Dolomit\r\nRiffe\" (285/1. \"Dolomitriffe Sudtirols und Venetiens.\" Wien, 1878.), and\r\nhave been exceedingly interested by it. What a wonderful change in\r\nthe future of geological chronology you indicate, by assuming the\r\ndescent-theory to be established, and then taking the graduated changes\r\nof the same group of organisms as the true standard! I never hoped to\r\nlive to see such a step even proposed by any one. (285/2. Published in\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" III., pages 234, 235.)\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I saw dimly that each bed in a formation could contain\r\nonly the organisms proper to a certain depth, and to other there\r\nexisting conditions, and that all the intermediate forms between one\r\nmarine species and another could rarely be preserved in the same\r\nplace and bed. Oppel, Neumayr, and yourself will confer a lasting and\r\nadmirable service on the noble science of Geology, if you can spread\r\nyour views so as to be generally known and accepted.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the continental and oceanic periods common to the whole\r\nnorthern hemisphere, to which you refer, I have sometimes speculated\r\nthat the present distribution of the land and sea over the world may\r\nhave formerly been very different to what it now is; and that new genera\r\nand families may have been developed on the shores of isolated tracts in\r\nthe south, and afterwards spread to the north.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 286. TO J.W. JUDD. Down, June 27th, 1878.\r\n\r\nI am heartily glad to hear of your intended marriage. A good wife is the\r\nsupreme blessing in this life, and I hope and believe from what you\r\nsay that you will be as happy as I have been in this respect. May your\r\nfuture geological work be as valuable as that which you have already\r\ndone; and more than this need not be wished for any man. The practical\r\nteaching of Geology seems an excellent idea.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for Neumayr, (286/1. Probably a paper on \"Die Congerien\r\nund Paludinenschichten Slavoniens und deren Fauna. Ein Beitrag zur\r\nDescendenz-Theorie,\" \"Wien. Geol. Abhandl.\" VII. (Heft 3), 1874-82.),\r\nbut I have already received and read a copy of the same, or at least of\r\na very similar essay, and admirably good it seemed to me.\r\n\r\nThis essay, and one by Mojsisovics (286/2. See note to Letter 285.),\r\nwhich I have lately read, show what Palaeontology in the future will do\r\nfor the classification and sequence of formations. It delighted me to\r\nsee so inverted an order of proceeding--viz., the assuming the descent\r\nof species as certain, and then taking the changes of closely allied\r\nforms as the standard of geological time. My health is better than it\r\nwas a few years ago, but I never pass a day without much discomfort and\r\nthe sense of extreme fatigue.\r\n\r\n(286/3. We owe to Professor Judd the following interesting recollections\r\nof Mr. Darwin, written about 1883:--\r\n\r\n\"On this last occasion, when I congratulated him on his seeming better\r\ncondition of health, he told me of the cause for anxiety which he had in\r\nthe state of his heart. Indeed, I cannot help feeling that he had a\r\nkind of presentiment that his end was approaching. When I left him, he\r\ninsisted on conducting me to the door, and there was that in his tone\r\nand manner which seemed to convey to me the sad intelligence that it\r\nwas not merely a temporary farewell, though he himself was perfectly\r\ncheerful and happy.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible for me adequately to express the impression made upon\r\nmy mind by my various conversations with Mr. Darwin. His extreme\r\nmodesty led him to form the lowest estimate of his own labours, and\r\na correspondingly extravagant idea of the value of the work done by\r\nothers. His deference to the arguments and suggestions of men greatly\r\nhis juniors, and his unaffected sympathy in their pursuits, was most\r\nmarked and characteristic; indeed, he, the great master of science, used\r\nto speak, and I am sure felt, as though he were appealing to superior\r\nauthority for information in all his conversations. It was only when a\r\nquestion was fully discussed with him that one became conscious of the\r\nfund of information he could bring to its elucidation, and the breadth\r\nof thought with which he had grasped it. Of his gentle, loving nature,\r\nof which I had so many proofs, I need not write; no one could be with\r\nhim, even for a few minutes, without being deeply impressed by his\r\ngrateful kindliness and goodness.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 287. TO COUNT SAPORTA. Down, August 15th, 1878.\r\n\r\nI thank you very sincerely for your kind and interesting letter. It\r\nwould be false in me to pretend that I care very much about my election\r\nto the Institute, but the sympathy of some few of my friends has\r\ngratified me deeply.\r\n\r\nI am extremely glad to hear that you are going to publish a work on the\r\nmore ancient fossil plants; and I thank you beforehand for the volume\r\nwhich you kindly say that you will send me. I earnestly hope that you\r\nwill give, at least incidentally, the results at which you have arrived\r\nwith respect to the more recent Tertiary plants; for the close gradation\r\nof such forms seems to me a fact of paramount importance for the\r\nprinciple of evolution. Your cases are like those on the gradation in\r\nthe genus Equus, recently discovered by Marsh in North America.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 288. TO THE DUKE OF ARGYLL.\r\n\r\n(288/1. The following letter was published in \"Nature,\" March 5th, 1891,\r\nVolume XLIII., page 415, together with a note from the late Duke of\r\nArgyll, in which he stated that the letter had been written to him by\r\nMr. Darwin in reply to the question, \"why it was that he did assume the\r\nunity of mankind as descended from a single pair.\" The Duke added that\r\nin the reply Mr. Darwin \"does not repudiate this interpretation of his\r\ntheory, but simply proceeds to explain and to defend the doctrine.\" On\r\na former occasion the Duke of Argyll had \"alluded as a fact to the\r\ncircumstance that Charles Darwin assumed mankind to have arisen at\r\none place, and therefore in a single pair.\" The letter from Darwin was\r\npublished in answer to some scientific friends, who doubted the fact and\r\nasked for the reference on which the statement was based.)\r\n\r\nDown, September 23rd, 1878.\r\n\r\nThe problem which you state so clearly is a very interesting one, on\r\nwhich I have often speculated. As far as I can judge, the improbability\r\nis extreme that the same well-characterised species should be produced\r\nin two distinct countries, or at two distinct times. It is certain that\r\nthe same variation may arise in two distinct places, as with albinism\r\nor with the nectarine on peach-trees. But the evidence seems to me\r\noverwhelming that a well-marked species is the product, not of a single\r\nor of a few variations, but of a long series of modifications, each\r\nmodification resulting chiefly from adaptation to infinitely complex\r\nconditions (including the inhabitants of the same country), with more\r\nor less inheritance of all the preceding modifications. Moreover, as\r\nvariability depends more on the nature of the organism than on that of\r\nthe environment, the variations will tend to differ at each successive\r\nstage of descent. Now it seems to me improbable in the highest degree\r\nthat a species should ever have been exposed in two places to infinitely\r\ncomplex relations of exactly the same nature during a long series\r\nof modifications. An illustration will perhaps make what I have said\r\nclearer, though it applies only to the less important factors\r\nof inheritance and variability, and not to adaptation--viz., the\r\nimprobability of two men being born in two countries identical in body\r\nand mind. If, however, it be assumed that a species at each successive\r\nstage of its modification was surrounded in two distinct countries or\r\ntimes, by exactly the same assemblage of plants and animals, and by the\r\nsame physical conditions, then I can see no theoretical difficulty [in]\r\nsuch a species giving birth to the new form in the two countries. If\r\nyou will look to the sixth edition of my \"Origin,\" at page 100, you will\r\nfind a somewhat analogous discussion, perhaps more intelligible than\r\nthis letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 289. W.T. THISELTON-DYER TO THE EDITOR OF \"NATURE.\"\r\n\r\n(289/1. The following letter (\"Nature,\" Volume XLIII., page 535)\r\ncriticises the interpretation given by the Duke to Mr. Darwin's letter.)\r\n\r\nRoyal Gardens, Kew, March 27th [1891].\r\n\r\nIn \"Nature\" of March 5th (page 415), the Duke of Argyll has printed\r\na very interesting letter of Mr. Darwin's, from which he drew the\r\ninference that the writer \"assumed mankind to have arisen...in a single\r\npair.\" I do not think myself that the letter bears this interpretation.\r\nBut the point in its most general aspect is a very important one, and\r\nis often found to present some difficulty to students of Mr. Darwin's\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\nQuite recently I have found by accident, amongst the papers of the late\r\nMr. Bentham at Kew, a letter of friendly criticism from Mr. Darwin upon\r\nthe presidential address which Mr. Bentham delivered to the Linnean\r\nSociety on May 24th, 1869. This letter, I think, has been overlooked and\r\nnot published previously. In it Mr. Darwin expresses himself with regard\r\nto the multiple origin of races and some other points in very explicit\r\nlanguage. Prof. Meldola, to whom I mentioned in conversation the\r\nexistence of the letter, urged me strongly to print it. This, therefore,\r\nI now do, with the addition of a few explanatory notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 290. TO G. BENTHAM. Down, November 25th, 1869.\r\n\r\n(290/1. The notes to this letter are by Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer, and\r\nappeared in \"Nature,\" loc. cit.)\r\n\r\nI was greatly interested by your address, which I have now read thrice,\r\nand which I believe will have much influence on all who read it. But you\r\nare mistaken in thinking that I ever said you were wrong on any point.\r\nAll that I meant was that on certain points, and these very doubtful\r\npoints, I was inclined to differ from you. And now, on further\r\nconsidering the point on which some two or three months ago I felt most\r\ninclined to differ--viz., on isolation--I find I differ very little.\r\nWhat I have to say is really not worth saying, but as I should be very\r\nsorry not to do whatever you asked, I will scribble down the slightly\r\ndissentient thoughts which have occurred to me. It would be an endless\r\njob to specify the points in which you have interested me; but I may\r\njust mention the relation of the extreme western flora of Europe (some\r\nsuch very vague thoughts have crossed my mind, relating to the Glacial\r\nperiod) with South Africa, and your remarks on the contrast of passive\r\nand active distribution.\r\n\r\nPage lxx.--I think the contingency of a rising island, not as yet fully\r\nstocked with plants, ought always to be kept in mind when speaking of\r\ncolonisation.\r\n\r\nPage lxxiv.--I have met with nothing which makes me in the least doubt\r\nthat large genera present a greater number of varieties relatively to\r\ntheir size than do small genera. (290/2. Bentham thought \"degree of\r\nvariability... like other constitutional characters, in the first place\r\nan individual one, which...may become more or less hereditary, and\r\ntherefore specific; and thence, but in a very faint degree, generic.\"\r\nHe seems to mean to argue against the conclusion which Sir Joseph\r\nHooker had quoted from Mr. Darwin that \"species of large genera are\r\nmore variable than those of small.\" [On large genera varying, see Letter\r\n53.]) Hooker was convinced by my data, never as yet published in full,\r\nonly abstracted in the \"Origin.\"\r\n\r\nPage lxxviii.--I dispute whether a new race or species is necessarily,\r\nor even generally, descended from a single or pair of parents. The\r\nwhole body of individuals, I believe, become altered together--like\r\nour race-horses, and like all domestic breeds which are changed through\r\n\"unconscious selection\" by man. (290/3. Bentham had said: \"We must also\r\nadmit that every race has probably been the offspring of one parent or\r\npair of parents, and consequently originated in one spot.\" The Duke of\r\nArgyll inverts the proposition.)\r\n\r\nWhen such great lengths of time are considered as are necessary to\r\nchange a specific form, I greatly doubt whether more or less rapid\r\npowers of multiplication have more than the most insignificant weight.\r\nThese powers, I think, are related to greater or less destruction in\r\nearly life.\r\n\r\nPage lxxix.--I still think you rather underrate the importance of\r\nisolation. I have come to think it very important from various grounds;\r\nthe anomalous and quasi-extinct forms on islands, etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWith respect to areas with numerous \"individually durable\" forms, can it\r\nbe said that they generally present a \"broken\" surface with \"impassable\r\nbarriers\"? This, no doubt, is true in certain cases, as Teneriffe. But\r\ndoes this hold with South-West Australia or the Cape? I much doubt.\r\nI have been accustomed to look at the cause of so many forms as being\r\npartly an arid or dry climate (as De Candolle insists) which indirectly\r\nleads to diversified [?] conditions; and, secondly, to isolation from\r\nthe rest of the world during a very long period, so that other more\r\ndominant forms have not entered, and there has been ample time for much\r\nspecification and adaptation of character.\r\n\r\nPage lxxx.--I suppose you think that the Restiaceae, Proteaceae (290/4.\r\nIt is doubtful whether Bentham did think so. In his 1870 address he\r\nsays: \"I cannot resist the opinion that all presumptive evidence is\r\nagainst European Proteaceae, and that all direct evidence in their\r\nfavour has broken down upon cross-examination.\"), etc., etc., once\r\nextended over the world, leaving fragments in the south.\r\n\r\nYou in several places speak of distribution of plants as if exclusively\r\ngoverned by soil and climate. I know that you do not mean this, but I\r\nregret whenever a chance is omitted of pointing out that the struggle\r\nwith other plants (and hostile animals) is far more important.\r\n\r\nI told you that I had nothing worth saying, but I have given you my\r\nTHOUGHTS.\r\n\r\nHow detestable are the Roman numerals! why should not the President's\r\naddresses, which are often, and I am sure in this case, worth more than\r\nall the rest of the number, be paged with Christian figures?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 291. TO R. MELDOLA.\r\n\r\n(291/1. \"This letter was in reply to a suggestion that in his preface\r\nMr. Darwin should point out by references to \"The Origin of Species\"\r\nand his other writings how far he had already traced out the path which\r\nWeismann went over. The suggestion was made because in a great many of\r\nthe continental writings upon the theory of descent, many of the points\r\nwhich had been clearly foreshadowed, and in some cases even explicitly\r\nstated by Darwin, had been rediscovered and published as though\r\noriginal. In the notes to my edition of Weismann I have endeavoured to\r\ndo Darwin full justice.--R.M.\" See Letter 310.)\r\n\r\n4, Bryanston Street, November 26th, 1878.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to say that I cannot agree to your suggestion. An author\r\nis never a fit judge of his own work, and I should dislike extremely\r\npointing out when and how Weismann's conclusions and work agreed with my\r\nown. I feel sure that I ought not to do this, and it would be to me\r\nan intolerable task. Nor does it seem to me the proper office of the\r\npreface, which is to show what the book contains, and that the contents\r\nappear to me valuable. But I can see no objection for you, if you think\r\nfit, to write an introduction with remarks or criticisms of any kind. Of\r\ncourse, I would be glad to advise you on any point as far as lay in my\r\npower, but as a whole I could have nothing to do with it, on the grounds\r\nabove specified, that an author cannot and ought not to attempt to judge\r\nhis own works, or compare them with others. I am sorry to refuse to do\r\nanything which you wish.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 292. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, January 18th, 1879.\r\n\r\nI have just finished your present of the Life of Hume (292/1. \"Hume\" in\r\nMr. Morley's \"English Men of Letters\" series. Of the biographical part\r\nof this book Mr. Huxley wrote, in a letter to Mr. Skelton, January 1879\r\n(\"Life of T.H. Huxley,\" II., page 7): \"It is the nearest approach to a\r\nwork of fiction of which I have yet been guilty.\"), and must thank you\r\nfor the great pleasure which it has given me. Your discussions are,\r\nas it seems to me, clear to a quite marvellous degree, and many of\r\nthe little interspersed flashes of wit are delightful. I particularly\r\nenjoyed the pithy judgment in about five words on Comte. (292/2.\r\nPossibly the passage referred to is on page 52.) Notwithstanding the\r\nclearness of every sentence, the subjects are in part so difficult that\r\nI found them stiff reading. I fear, therefore, that it will be too stiff\r\nfor the general public; but I heartily hope that this will prove to be a\r\nmistake, and in this case the intelligence of the public will be greatly\r\nexalted in my eyes. The writing of this book must have been awfully hard\r\nwork, I should think.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 293. TO F. MULLER. Down, March 4th [1879].\r\n\r\nI thank you cordially for your letter. Your facts and discussion on the\r\nloss of the hairs on the legs of the caddis-flies seem to me the most\r\nimportant and interesting thing which I have read for a very long time.\r\nI hope that you will not disapprove, but I have sent your letter to\r\n\"Nature\" (293/1. Fritz Muller, \"On a Frog having Eggs on its Back--On\r\nthe Abortion of the Hairs on the Legs of certain Caddis-Flies, etc.\":\r\nMuller's letter and one from Charles Darwin were published in \"Nature,\"\r\nVolume XIX., page 462, 1879.), with a few prefatory remarks, pointing\r\nout to the general reader the importance of your view, and stating\r\nthat I have been puzzled for many years on this very point. If, as I\r\nam inclined to believe, your view can be widely extended, it will be a\r\ncapital gain to the doctrine of evolution. I see by your various papers\r\nthat you are working away energetically, and, wherever you look, you\r\nseem to discover something quite new and extremely interesting. Your\r\nbrother also continues to do fine work on the fertilisation of flowers\r\nand allied subjects.\r\n\r\nI have little or nothing to tell you about myself. I go slowly crawling\r\non with my present subject--the various and complicated movements of\r\nplants. I have not been very well of late, and am tired to-day, so will\r\nwrite no more. With the most cordial sympathy in all your work, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 294. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, April 19th, 1879.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the book. (294/1. Ernst Hackel's \"Freedom in Science and\r\nTeaching,\" with a prefatory note by T.H. Huxley, 1879. Professor Hackel\r\nhas recently published (without permission) a letter in which Mr. Darwin\r\ncomments severely on Virchow. It is difficult to say which would have\r\npained Mr. Darwin more--the affront to a colleague, or the breach of\r\nconfidence in a friend.) I have read only the preface...It is capital,\r\nand I enjoyed the tremendous rap on the knuckles which you gave Virchow\r\nat the close. What a pleasure it must be to write as you can do!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 295. TO E.S. MORSE. Down, October 21st, 1879.\r\n\r\nAlthough you are so kind as to tell me not to write, I must just thank\r\nyou for the proofs of your paper, which has interested me greatly.\r\n(295/1. See \"The Shell Mounds of Omori\" in the \"Memoirs of the Science\r\nDepartment of the Univ. of Tokio,\" Volume I., Part I., 1879. The ridges\r\non Arca are mentioned at page 25. In \"Nature,\" April 15th, 1880, Mr.\r\nDarwin published a letter by Mr. Morse relating to the review of the\r\nabove paper, which appeared in \"Nature,\" XXI., page 350. Mr. Darwin\r\nintroduces Mr. Morse's letter with some prefatory remarks. The\r\ncorrespondence is republished in the \"American Naturalist,\" September,\r\n1880.) The increase in the number of ridges in the three species of Arca\r\nseems to be a very noteworthy fact, as does the increase of size in so\r\nmany, yet not all, the species. What a constant state of fluctuation\r\nthe whole organic world seems to be in! It is interesting to hear that\r\neverywhere the first change apparently is in the proportional numbers of\r\nthe species. I was much struck with the fact in the upraised shells of\r\nCoquimbo, in Chili, as mentioned in my \"Geological Observations on South\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the wonders in the world, the progress of Japan, in which you\r\nhave been aiding, seems to me about the most wonderful.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 296. TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, January 5th 1880.\r\n\r\nAs this note requires no sort of answer, you must allow me to express\r\nmy lively admiration of your paper in the \"Nineteenth Century.\" (296/1.\r\n\"Nineteenth Century,\" January 1880, page 93, \"On the Origin of Species\r\nand Genera.\") You certainly are a master in the difficult art of clear\r\nexposition. It is impossible to urge too often that the selection from a\r\nsingle varying individual or of a single varying organ will not suffice.\r\nYou have worked in capitally Allen's admirable researches. (296/2. J.A.\r\nAllen, \"On the Mammals and Winter Birds of East Florida, etc.\" (\"Bull.\r\nMus. Comp. Zoolog. Harvard,\" Volume II.) As usual, you delight to honour\r\nme more than I deserve. When I have written about the extreme slowness\r\nof Natural Selection (296/3. Mr. Wallace makes a calculation based on\r\nAllen's results as to the very short period in which the formation of a\r\nrace of birds differing 10 to 20 per cent. from the average in length of\r\nwing and strength of beak might conceivably be effected. He thinks that\r\nthe slowness of the action of Natural Selection really depends on the\r\nslowness of the changes naturally occurring in the physical conditions,\r\netc.) (in which I hope I may be wrong), I have chiefly had in my mind\r\nthe effects of intercrossing. I subscribe to almost everything you say\r\nexcepting the last short sentence. (296/4. The passage in question is\r\nas follows: \"I have also attempted to show that the causes which have\r\nproduced the separate species of one genus, of one family, or perhaps of\r\none order, from a common ancestor, are not necessarily the same as those\r\nwhich have produced the separate orders, classes, and sub-kingdoms\r\nfrom more remote common ancestors. That all have been alike produced by\r\n'descent with modification' from a few primitive types, the whole body\r\nof evidence clearly indicates; but while individual variation with\r\nNatural Selection is proved to be adequate for the production of the\r\nformer, we have no proof and hardly any evidence that it is adequate\r\nto initiate those important divergences of type which characterise the\r\nlatter.\" In this passage stress should be laid (as Mr. Wallace points\r\nout to us) on the word PROOF. He by no means asserts that the causes\r\nwhich have produced the species of a genus are inadequate to produce\r\ngreater differences. His object is rather to urge the difference between\r\nproof and probability.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 297. TO J.H. FABRE.\r\n\r\n(297/1. A letter to M. Fabre is given in \"Life and Letters,\" III., page\r\n220, in which the suggestion is made of rotating the insect before a\r\n\"homing\" experiment occurs.)\r\n\r\nDown, February 20th, 1880.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your kind letter, and am delighted that you will try the\r\nexperiment of rotation. It is very curious that such a belief should\r\nbe held about cats in your country (297/2. M. Fabre had written from\r\nSerignan, Vaucluse: \"Parmi la population des paysans de mon village,\r\nl'habitude est de faire tourner dans un sac le chat que l'on se propose\r\nde porter ailleurs, et dont on veut empecher le retour. J'ignore si\r\ncette pratique obtient du succes.\"), I never heard of anything of the\r\nkind in England. I was led, as I believe, to think of the experiment\r\nfrom having read in Wrangel's \"Travels in Siberia\" (297/3. Admiral\r\nFerdinand Petrovich von Wrangell, \"Le Nord de la Siberie, Voyage\r\nparmi les Peuplades de la Russie asiatique, etc.\" Paris, 1843.) of the\r\nwonderful power which the Samoyedes possess of keeping their direction\r\nin a fog whilst travelling in a tortuous line through broken ice. With\r\nrespect to cats, I have seen an account that in Belgium there is a\r\nsociety which gives prizes to the cat which can soonest find its way\r\nhome, and for this purpose they are carried to distant parts of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nHere would be a capital opportunity for trying rotation.\r\n\r\nI am extremely glad to hear that your book will probably be translated\r\ninto English.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I shall be much pleased to hear the result of your experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 298. TO J.H. FABRE. Down, January 21st, 1881.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your very interesting letter. Your results appear\r\nto me highly important, as they eliminate one means by which animals\r\nmight perhaps recognise direction; and this, from what has been said\r\nabout savages, and from our own consciousness, seemed the most probable\r\nmeans. If you think it worth while, you can of course mention my name in\r\nrelation to this subject.\r\n\r\nShould you succeed in eliminating a sense of the magnetic currents of\r\nthe earth, you would leave the field of investigation quite open.\r\nI suppose that even those who still believe that each species was\r\nseparately created would admit that certain animals possess some sense\r\nby which they perceive direction, and which they use instinctively.\r\nOn mentioning the subject to my son George, who is a mathematician and\r\nknows something about magnetism, he suggested making a very thin needle\r\ninto a magnet; then breaking it into very short pieces, which would\r\nstill be magnetic, and fastening one of these pieces with some cement on\r\nthe thorax of the insect to be experimented on.\r\n\r\nHe believes that such a little magnet, from its close proximity to\r\nthe nervous system of the insect, would affect it more than would the\r\nterrestrial currents.\r\n\r\nI have received your essay on Halictus (298/1. \"Sur les Moeurs et la\r\nParthenogese des Halictes\" (\"Ann. Sc. Nat.\" IX., 1879-80).), which I am\r\nsure that I shall read with much interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 299. TO T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n(299/1. On April 9th, 1880, Mr. Huxley lectured at the Royal Institution\r\non \"The Coming of Age of the Origin of Species.\" The lecture was\r\npublished in \"Nature\" and in Huxley's \"Collected Essays,\" Volume II.,\r\npage 227. Darwin's letter to Huxley on the subject is given in \"Life\r\nand Letters,\" III., page 240; in Huxley's reply of May 10th (\"Life and\r\nLetters of T.H. Huxley,\" II., page 12) he writes: \"I hope you do not\r\nimagine because I had nothing to say about 'Natural Selection' that I am\r\nat all weak of faith on that article...But the first thing seems to me\r\nto be to drive the fact of evolution into people's heads; when that is\r\nonce safe, the rest will come easy.\")\r\n\r\nDown, May 11th, 1880.\r\n\r\nI had no intention to make you write to me, or expectation of your\r\ndoing so; but your note has been so far \"cheerier\" (299/2. \"You are the\r\ncheeriest letter-writer I know\": Huxley to Darwin. See Huxley's \"Life,\"\r\nII., page 12.) to me than mine could have been to you, that I must\r\nand will write again. I saw your motive for not alluding to Natural\r\nSelection, and quite agreed in my mind in its wisdom. But at the same\r\ntime it occurred to me that you might be giving it up, and that anyhow\r\nyou could not safely allude to it without various \"provisos\" too long to\r\ngive in a lecture. If I think continuously on some half-dozen structures\r\nof which we can at present see no use, I can persuade myself that\r\nNatural Selection is of quite subordinate importance. On the other hand,\r\nwhen I reflect on the innumerable structures, especially in plants,\r\nwhich twenty years ago would have been called simply \"morphological\" and\r\nuseless, and which are now known to be highly important, I can persuade\r\nmyself that every structure may have been developed through Natural\r\nSelection. It is really curious how many out of a list of structures\r\nwhich Bronn enumerated, as not possibly due to Natural Selection because\r\nof no functional importance, can now be shown to be highly important.\r\nLobed leaves was, I believe, one case, and only two or three days ago\r\nFrank showed me how they act in a manner quite sufficiently important to\r\naccount for the lobing of any large leaf. I am particularly delighted at\r\nwhat you say about domestic dogs, jackals, and wolves, because from\r\nmere indirect evidence I arrived in \"Varieties of Domestic Animals\" at\r\nexactly the same conclusion (299/3. Mr. Darwin's view was that domestic\r\ndogs descend from more than one wild species.) with respect to the\r\ndomestic dogs of Europe and North America. See how important in another\r\nway this conclusion is; for no one can doubt that large and small dogs\r\nare perfectly fertile together, and produce fertile mongrels; and how\r\nwell this supports the Pallasian doctrine (299/4. See Letter 80.) that\r\ndomestication eliminates the sterility almost universal between forms\r\nslowly developed in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nI humbly beg your pardon for bothering you with so long a note; but it\r\nis your own fault.\r\n\r\nPlants are splendid for making one believe in Natural Selection, as will\r\nand consciousness are excluded. I have lately been experimenting on\r\nsuch a curious structure for bursting open the seed-coats: I declare\r\none might as well say that a pair of scissors or nutcrackers had been\r\ndeveloped through external conditions as the structure in question.\r\n(299/5. The peg or heel in Cucurbita: see \"Power of Movement in Plants\"\r\npage 102.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 300. TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, November 5th, 1880.\r\n\r\nOn reading over your excellent review (300/1. See \"Nature,\" November\r\n4th, 1880, page 1, a review of Volume I. of the publications of the\r\n\"Challenger,\" to which Sir Wyville Thomson contributed a General\r\nIntroduction.) with the sentence quoted from Sir Wyville Thomson, it\r\nseemed to me advisable, considering the nature of the publication, to\r\nnotice \"extreme variation\" and another point. Now, will you read the\r\nenclosed, and if you approve, post it soon. If you disapprove, throw it\r\nin the fire, and thus add one more to the thousand kindnesses which you\r\nhave done me. Do not write: I shall see result in next week's \"Nature.\"\r\nPlease observe that in the foul copy I had added a final sentence\r\nwhich I do not at first copy, as it seemed to me inferentially too\r\ncontemptuous; but I have now pinned it to the back, and you can send\r\nit or not, as you think best,--that is, if you think any part worth\r\nsending. My request will not cost you much trouble--i.e. to read two\r\npages, for I know that you can decide at once. I heartily enjoyed my\r\ntalk with you on Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nP.S.--If my manuscript appears too flat, too contemptuous, too spiteful,\r\nor too anything, I earnestly beseech you to throw it into the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 301. CHARLES DARWIN TO THE EDITOR OF \"NATURE.\"\r\n\r\n(301/1. \"Nature,\" November 11th, 1880, page 32.)\r\n\r\nDown, November 5th, 1880.\r\n\r\nSir Wyville Thomson and Natural Selection.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to find that Sir Wyville Thomson does not understand the\r\nprinciple of Natural Selection, as explained by Mr. Wallace and myself.\r\nIf he had done so, he could not have written the following sentence in\r\nthe Introduction to the Voyage of the \"Challenger\": \"The character of\r\nthe abyssal fauna refuses to give the least support to the theory which\r\nrefers the evolution of species to extreme variation guided only by\r\nNatural Selection.\" This is a standard of criticism not uncommonly\r\nreached by theologians and metaphysicians, when they write on scientific\r\nsubjects, but is something new as coming from a naturalist. Professor\r\nHuxley demurs to it in the last number of \"Nature\"; but he does not\r\ntouch on the expression of extreme variation, nor on that of evolution\r\nbeing guided only by Natural Selection. Can Sir Wyville Thomson name any\r\none who has said that the evolution of species depends only on Natural\r\nSelection? As far as concerns myself, I believe that no one has brought\r\nforward so many observations on the effects of the use and disuse of\r\nparts, as I have done in my \"Variation of Animals and Plants under\r\nDomestication\"; and these observations were made for this special\r\nobject. I have likewise there adduced a considerable body of facts,\r\nshowing the direct action of external conditions on organisms; though no\r\ndoubt since my books were published much has been learnt on this head.\r\nIf Sir Wyville Thomson were to visit the yard of a breeder, and saw all\r\nhis cattle or sheep almost absolutely true--that is, closely similar, he\r\nwould exclaim: \"Sir, I see here no extreme variation; nor can I find any\r\nsupport to the belief that you have followed the principle of selection\r\nin the breeding of your animals.\" From what I formerly saw of breeders,\r\nI have no doubt that the man thus rebuked would have smiled and said not\r\na word. If he had afterwards told the story to other breeders, I greatly\r\nfear that they would have used emphatic but irreverent language about\r\nnaturalists.\r\n\r\n(301/2. The following is the passage omitted by the advice of Huxley:\r\nsee his \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 14:--\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it would have been wiser on my part to have remained quite\r\nsilent, like the breeder; for, as Prof. Sedgwick remarked many years\r\nago, in reference to the poor old Dean of York, who was never weary of\r\ninveighing against geologists, a man who talks about what he does not in\r\nthe least understand, is invulnerable.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 302. TO G.J. ROMANES.\r\n\r\n(302/1. Part of this letter has been published in Mr. C. Barber's note\r\non \"Graft-Hybrids of the Sugar-Cane,\" in \"The Sugar-Cane,\" November\r\n1896.)\r\n\r\nDown, January 1st, 1881.\r\n\r\nI send the MS., but as far as I can judge by just skimming it, it will\r\nbe of no use to you. It seems to bear on transitional forms. I feel sure\r\nthat I have other and better cases, but I cannot remember where to look.\r\n\r\nI should have written to you in a few days on the following case. The\r\nBaron de Villa Franca wrote to me from Brazil about two years ago,\r\ndescribing new varieties of sugar-cane which he had raised by planting\r\ntwo old varieties in apposition. I believe (but my memory is very\r\nfaulty) that I wrote that I could not believe in such a result, and\r\nattributed the new varieties to the soil, etc. I believe that I did\r\nnot understand what he meant by apposition. Yesterday a packet of MS.\r\narrived from the Brazilian Legation, with a letter in French from Dr.\r\nGlass, Director of the Botanic Gardens, describing fully how he first\r\nattempted grafting varieties of sugar-cane in various ways, and always\r\nfailed, and then split stems of two varieties, bound them together and\r\nplanted them, and then raised some new and very valuable varieties,\r\nwhich, like crossed plants, seem to grow with extra vigour, are\r\nconstant, and apparently partake of the character of the two varieties.\r\nThe Baron also sends me an attested copy from a number of Brazilian\r\ncultivators of the success of the plan of raising new varieties. I\r\nam not sure whether the Brazilian Legation wishes me to return the\r\ndocument, but if I do not hear in three or four days that they must be\r\nreturned, they shall be sent to you, for they seem to me well deserving\r\nyour consideration.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if I had been contented with my hyacinth bulbs being merely\r\nbound together without any true adhesion or rather growth together, I\r\nshould have succeeded like the old Dutchman.\r\n\r\nThere is a deal of superfluous verbiage in the documents, but I have\r\nmarked with pencil where the important part begins. The attestations\r\nare in duplicate. Now, after reading them will you give me your opinion\r\nwhether the main parts are worthy of publication in \"Nature\": I\r\nam inclined to think so, and it is good to encourage science in\r\nout-of-the-way parts of the world.\r\n\r\nKeep this note till you receive the documents or hear from me. I wonder\r\nwhether two varieties of wheat could be similarly treated? No, I suppose\r\nnot--from the want of lateral buds. I was extremely interested by your\r\nabstract on suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 303. TO K. SEMPER. Down, February 6th, 1881.\r\n\r\nOwing to all sorts of work, I have only just now finished reading your\r\n\"Natural Conditions of Existence.\" (303/1. Semper's \"Natural Conditions\r\nof Existence as they affect Animal Life\" (International Science Series),\r\n1881.) Although a book of small size, it contains an astonishing amount\r\nof matter, and I have been particularly struck with the originality with\r\nwhich you treat so many subjects, and at your scrupulous accuracy. In\r\nfar the greater number of points I quite follow you in your conclusions,\r\nbut I differ on some, and I suppose that no two men in the world would\r\nfully agree on so many different subjects. I have been interested on\r\nso many points, I can hardly say on which most. Perhaps as much on\r\nGeographical Distribution as on any other, especially in relation to M.\r\nWagner. (No! no! about parasites interested me even more.) How strange\r\nthat Wagner should have thought that I meant by struggle for existence,\r\nstruggle for food. It is curious that he should not have thought of the\r\nendless adaptations for the dispersal of seeds and the fertilisation of\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nAgain I was much interested about Branchipus and Artemia. (303/2. The\r\nreference is to Schmankewitsch's experiments, page 158: he kept Artemia\r\nsalina in salt-water, gradually diluted with fresh-water until it became\r\npractically free from salt; the crustaceans gradually changed in the\r\ncourse of generations, until they acquired the characters of the genus\r\nBranchipus.) When I read imperfectly some years ago the original paper\r\nI could not avoid thinking that some special explanation would hereafter\r\nbe found for so curious a case. I speculated whether a species very\r\nliable to repeated and great changes of conditions, might not acquire\r\na fluctuating condition ready to be adapted to either conditions. With\r\nrespect to Arctic animals being white (page 116 of your book) it might\r\nperhaps be worth your looking at what I say from Pallas' and my own\r\nobservations in the \"Descent of Man\" (later editions) Chapter VIII.,\r\npage 229, and Chapter XVIII., page 542.\r\n\r\nI quite agree with what I gather to be your judgment, viz., that the\r\ndirect action of the conditions of life on organisms, or the cause of\r\ntheir variability, is the most important of all subjects for the\r\nfuture. For some few years I have been thinking of commencing a set of\r\nexperiments on plants, for they almost invariably vary when cultivated.\r\nI fancy that I see my way with the aid of continued self-fertilisation.\r\nBut I am too old, and have not strength enough. Nevertheless the hope\r\noccasionally revives.\r\n\r\nFinally let me thank you for the very kind manner in which you often\r\nrefer to my works, and for the even still kinder manner in which you\r\ndisagree with me.\r\n\r\nWith cordial thanks for the pleasure and instruction which I have\r\nderived from your book, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 304. TO COUNT SAPORTA. Down, February 13th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI received a week or two ago the work which you and Prof. Marion have\r\nbeen so kind as to send me. (304/1. Probably \"L'Evolution du Regne\r\nvegetal,\" I. \"Cryptogames,\" Saporta & Marion, Paris, 1881.) When it\r\narrived I was much engaged, and this must be my excuse for not having\r\nsooner thanked you for it, and it will likewise account for my having as\r\nyet read only the preface.\r\n\r\nBut I now look forward with great pleasure to reading the whole\r\nimmediately. If I then have any remarks worth sending, which is not very\r\nprobable, I will write again. I am greatly pleased to see how boldly\r\nyou express your belief in evolution, in the preface. I have sometimes\r\nthought that some of your countrymen have been a little timid in\r\npublishing their belief on this head, and have thus failed in aiding a\r\ngood cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 305. TO R.G. WHITEMAN. Down, May 5th, 1881.\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of the \"Origin,\" after the sentence ending with the\r\nwords \"...insects in the water,\" I added the following sentence:--\r\n\r\n\"Even in so extreme a case as this, if the supply of insects were\r\nconstant, and if better adapted competitors did not already exist in the\r\ncountry, I can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered by\r\nNatural Selection more and more aquatic in their structures and habits,\r\nwith larger and larger mouths, till a creature was produced as monstrous\r\nas a whale.\" (305/1. See Letters 110 and 120.)\r\n\r\nThis sentence was omitted in the subsequent editions, owing to the\r\nadvice of Prof. Owen, as it was liable to be misinterpreted; but I have\r\nalways regretted that I followed this advice, for I still think the view\r\nquite reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 306. TO A. HYATT. Down, May 8th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your kind gift of \"The Genesis, etc.\" (306/1. \"The\r\nGenesis of the Tertiary Species of Planorbis,\" in the \"Boston Soc. Nat.\r\nHist. Anniversary Mem.\" 1880.), which I shall be glad to read, as the\r\ncase has always seemed to me a very curious one. It is all the kinder in\r\nyou to send me this book, as I am aware that you think that I have done\r\nnothing to advance the good cause of the Descent-theory. (306/2. The\r\nabove caused me to write a letter expressing a feeling of regret and\r\nhumiliation, which I hope is still preserved, for certainly such a\r\nfeeling, caused undoubtedly by my writings, which dealt too exclusively\r\nwith disagreements upon special points, needed a strong denial. I have\r\nused the Darwinian theory in many cases, especially in explaining the\r\npreservation of differences; and have denied its application only in the\r\npreservation of fixed and hereditary characteristics, which have become\r\nessentially homologous similarities. (Note by Prof. Hyatt.))\r\n\r\n(306/3. We have ventured to quote the passage from Prof. Hyatt's reply,\r\ndated May 23rd, 1881:--\r\n\r\n\"You would think I was insincere, if I wrote you what I really felt with\r\nregard to what you have done for the theory of Descent. Perhaps this\r\nessay will lead you to a more correct view than you now have of my\r\nestimate, if I can be said to have any claim to make an estimate of your\r\nwork in this direction. You will not take offence, however, if I tell\r\nyou that your strongest supporters can hardly give you greater esteem\r\nand honour. I have striven to get a just idea of your theory, but no\r\ndoubt have failed to convey this in my publications as it ought to be\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nWe find other equally strong and genuine expressions of respect in Prof.\r\nHyatt's letters.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 307. TO LORD FARRER.\r\n\r\n(307/1. Mr. Graham's book, the \"Creed of Science,\" is referred to in\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" I., page 315, where an interesting letter to the\r\nauthor is printed. With regard to chance, Darwin wrote: \"You have\r\nexpressed my inward conviction, though far more clearly and vividly than\r\nI could have done, that the universe is not the result of chance.\")\r\n\r\nDown, August 28th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI have been much interested by your letter, and am glad that you like\r\nMr. Graham's book...(307/2. In Lord Farrer's letter of August 27th he\r\nrefers to the old difficulty, in relation to design, of the existence of\r\nevil.)\r\n\r\nEverything which I read now soon goes out of my head, and I had\r\nforgotten that he implies that my views explain the universe; but it is\r\na most monstrous exaggeration. The more one thinks the more one feels\r\nthe hopeless immensity of man's ignorance. Though it does make one proud\r\nto see what science has achieved during the last half-century. This\r\nhas been brought vividly before my mind by having just read most of the\r\nproofs of Lubbock's Address for York (307/3. Lord Avebury was President\r\nof the British Association in 1881.), in which he will attempt to review\r\nthe progress of all branches of science for the last fifty years.\r\n\r\nI entirely agree with what you say about \"chance,\" except in relation\r\nto the variations of organic beings having been designed; and I imagine\r\nthat Mr. Graham must have used \"chance\" in relation only to purpose in\r\nthe origination of species. This is the only way I have used the word\r\nchance, as I have attempted to explain in the last two pages of my\r\n\"Variation under Domestication.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we consider the whole universe, the mind refuses\r\nto look at it as the outcome of chance--that is, without design or\r\npurpose. The whole question seems to me insoluble, for I cannot put much\r\nor any faith in the so-called intuitions of the human mind, which have\r\nbeen developed, as I cannot doubt, from such a mind as animals possess;\r\nand what would their convictions or intuitions be worth? There are a\r\ngood many points on which I cannot quite follow Mr. Graham.\r\n\r\nWith respect to your last discussion, I dare say it contains very much\r\ntruth; but I cannot see, as far as happiness is concerned, that it can\r\napply to the infinite sufferings of animals--not only those of the body,\r\nbut those of the mind--as when a mother loses her offspring or a male\r\nhis female. If the view does not apply to animals, will it suffice for\r\nman? But you may well complain of this long and badly-expressed note in\r\nmy dreadfully bad handwriting.\r\n\r\nThe death of my brother Erasmus is a very heavy loss to all of us in\r\nthis family. He was so kind-hearted and affectionate. Nor have I ever\r\nknown any one more pleasant. It was always a very great pleasure to talk\r\nwith him on any subject whatever, and this I shall never do again.\r\nThe clearness of his mind always seemed to me admirable. He was not, I\r\nthink, a happy man, and for many years did not value life, though never\r\ncomplaining. I am so glad that he escaped very severe suffering during\r\nhis last few days. I shall never see such a man again.\r\n\r\nForgive me for scribbling this way, my dear Farrer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 308. TO G.J. ROMANES.\r\n\r\n(308/1. Romanes had reviewed Roux's \"Struggle of Parts in the Organism\"\r\nin \"Nature,\" September 20th, 1881, page 505. This led to an attack by\r\nthe Duke of Argyll (October 20th, page 581), followed by a reply by\r\nRomanes (October 27th, page 604), a rejoinder by the Duke (November 3rd,\r\npage 6), and finally by the letter of Romanes (November 10th, page 29)\r\nto which Darwin refers. The Duke's \"flourish\" is at page 7: \"I wish Mr.\r\nDarwin's disciples would imitate a little of the dignified reticence of\r\ntheir master. He walks with a patient and a stately step along the paths\r\nof conscientious observation, etc., etc.\")\r\n\r\nDown, November 12th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI must write to say how very much I admire your letter in the last\r\n\"Nature.\" I subscribe to every word that you say, and it could not be\r\nexpressed more clearly or vigorously. After the Duke's last letter and\r\nflourish about me I thought it paltry not to say that I agreed with what\r\nyou had said. But after writing two folio pages I find I could not say\r\nwhat I wished to say without taking up too much space; and what I had\r\nwritten did not please me at all, so I tore it up, and now by all the\r\ngods I rejoice that I did so, for you have put the case incomparably\r\nbetter than I had done or could do.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I hate controversy, and it wastes much time, at least with a\r\nman who, like myself, can work for only a short time in a day. How in\r\nthe world you get through all your work astonishes me.\r\n\r\nNow do not make me feel guilty by answering this letter, and losing some\r\nof your time.\r\n\r\nYou ought not to swear at Roux's book, which has led you into this\r\ncontroversy, for I am sure that your last letter was well worth\r\nwriting--not that it will produce any effect on the Duke.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 309. TO J. JENNER WEIR.\r\n\r\n(309/1. On December 27th, 1881, Mr. Jenner Weir wrote to Mr. Darwin:\r\n\"After some hesitation in lieu of a Christmas card, I venture to give\r\nyou the return of some observations on mules made in Spain during the\r\nlast two years...It is a fact that the sire has the prepotency in\r\nthe offspring, as has been observed by most writers on that subject,\r\nincluding yourself. The mule is more ass-like, and the hinny more\r\nhorse-like, both in the respective lengths of the ears and the shape of\r\nthe tail; but one point I have observed which I do not remember to have\r\nmet with, and that is that the coat of the mule resembles that of its\r\ndam the mare, and that of the hinny its dam the ass, so that in this\r\nrespect the prepotency of the sexes is reversed.\" The hermaphroditism in\r\nlepidoptera, referred to below, is said by Mr. Weir to occur notably in\r\nthe case of the hybrids of Smerinthus populi-ocellatus.)\r\n\r\nDown, December 29th, 1881.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your \"Christmas card,\" and heartily return your good\r\nwishes. What you say about the coats of mules is new to me, as is the\r\nstatement about hermaphroditism in hybrid moths. This latter fact seems\r\nto me particularly curious; and to make a very wild hypothesis, I should\r\nbe inclined to account for it by reversion to the primordial condition\r\nof the two sexes being united, for I think it certain that hybridism\r\ndoes lead to reversion.\r\n\r\nI keep fairly well, but have not much strength, and feel very old.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 310. TO R. MELDOLA. Down, February 2nd, 1882.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry that I can add nothing to my very brief notice, without\r\nreading again Weismann's work and getting up the whole subject by\r\nreading my own and other books, and for so much labour I have not\r\nstrength. I have now been working at other subjects for some years, and\r\nwhen a man grows as old as I am, it is a great wrench to his brain to go\r\nback to old and half-forgotten subjects. You would not readily believe\r\nhow often I am asked questions of all kinds, and quite lately I have\r\nhad to give up much time to do a work, not at all concerning myself,\r\nbut which I did not like to refuse. I must, however, somewhere draw the\r\nline, or my life will be a misery to me.\r\n\r\nI have read your preface, and it seems to me excellent. (310/1. \"Studies\r\nin the Theory of Descent.\" By A. Weismann. Translated and Edited by\r\nRaphael Meldola; with a Prefatory Notice by C. Darwin and a Translator's\r\nPreface. See Letter 291.) I am sorry in many ways, including the honour\r\nof England as a scientific country, that your translation has as yet\r\nsold badly. Does the publisher or do you lose by it? If the publisher,\r\nthough I shall be sorry for him, yet it is in the way of business; but\r\nif you yourself lose by it, I earnestly beg you to allow me to subscribe\r\na trifle, viz., ten guineas, towards the expense of this work, which you\r\nhave undertaken on public grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 311. TO W. HORSFALL. Down, February 8th, 1882.\r\n\r\nIn the succession of the older Formations the species and genera of\r\ntrilobites do change, and then they all die out. To any one who believes\r\nthat geologists know the dawn of life (i.e., formations contemporaneous\r\nwith the first appearance of living creatures on the earth) no doubt\r\nthe sudden appearance of perfect trilobites and other organisms in the\r\noldest known life-bearing strata would be fatal to evolution. But I for\r\none, and many others, utterly reject any such belief. Already three or\r\nfour piles of unconformable strata are known beneath the Cambrian; and\r\nthese are generally in a crystalline condition, and may once have been\r\ncharged with organic remains.\r\n\r\nWith regard to animals and plants, the locomotive spores of some algae,\r\nfurnished with cilia, would have been ranked with animals if it had not\r\nbeen known that they developed into algae.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 312. TO JOHN COLLIER. Down, February 16th, 1882.\r\n\r\nI must thank you for the gift of your Art Primer, which I have read with\r\nmuch pleasure. Parts were too technical for me who could never draw a\r\nline, but I was greatly interested by the whole of the first part. I\r\nwish that you could explain why certain curved lines and symmetrical\r\nfigures give pleasure. But will not your brother artists scorn you for\r\nshowing yourself so good an evolutionist? Perhaps they will say that\r\nallowance must be made for him, as he has allied himself to so dreadful\r\na man as Huxley. This reminds me that I have just been reading the last\r\nvolume of essays. By good luck I had not read that on Priestley (312/1.\r\n\"Science and Culture, and other Essays\": London, 1881. The fifth Essay\r\nis on Joseph Priestley (page 94).), and it strikes me as the most\r\nsplendid essay which I ever read. That on automatism (312/2. Essay IX.\r\n(page 199) is entitled \"On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and\r\nits history.\") is wonderfully interesting: more is the pity, say I, for\r\nif I were as well armed as Huxley I would challenge him to a duel on\r\nthis subject. But I am a deal too wise to do anything of the kind, for\r\nhe would run me through the body half a dozen times with his sharp and\r\npolished rapier before I knew where I was. I did not intend to have\r\nscribbled all this nonsense, but only to have thanked you for your\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nEverybody whom I have seen and who has seen your picture of me is\r\ndelighted with it. I shall be proud some day to see myself suspended at\r\nthe Linnean Society. (312/3. The portrait painted by Mr. Collier hangs\r\nin the meeting-room of the Linnean Society.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VI.--GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION, 1843-1867.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 313. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Tuesday [December 12th, 1843].\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged to you for your interesting letter. I have long\r\nbeen very anxious, even for as short a sketch as you have kindly sent me\r\nof the botanical geography of the southern hemisphere. I shall be most\r\ncurious to see your results in detail. From my entire ignorance of\r\nBotany, I am sorry to say that I cannot answer any of the questions\r\nwhich you ask me. I think I mention in my \"Journal\" that I found my old\r\nfriend the southern beech (I cannot say positively which species), on\r\nthe mountain-top, in southern parts of Chiloe and at level of sea in\r\nlat. 45 deg, in Chonos Archipelago. Would not the southern end of Chiloe\r\nmake a good division for you? I presume, from the collection of Brydges\r\nand Anderson, Chiloe is pretty well-known, and southward begins a terra\r\nincognita. I collected a few plants amongst the Chonos Islands. The\r\nbeech being found here and peat being found here, and general appearance\r\nof landscape, connects the Chonos Islands and T. del Fuego. I saw the\r\nAlerce (313/1. \"Alerse\" is the local name of a South American timber,\r\ndescribed in Capt. King's \"Voyages of the 'Adventure' and 'Beagle,'\"\r\npage 281, and rather doubtfully identified with Thuja tetragona, Hook.\r\n(\"Flora Antarctica,\" page 350.)) on mountains of Chiloe (on the mainland\r\nit grows to an enormous size, and I always believed Alerce and Araucaria\r\nimbricata to be identical), but I am ashamed to say I absolutely forget\r\nall about its appearance. I saw some Juniper-like bush in T. del Fuego,\r\nbut can tell you no more about it, as I presume that you have seen\r\nCapt. King's collection in Mr. Brown's possession, provisionally for the\r\nBritish Museum. I fear you will be much disappointed in my few plants:\r\nan ignorant person cannot collect; and I, moreover, lost one, the\r\nfirst, and best set of the Alpine plants. On the other hand, I hope the\r\nGalapagos plants (313/2. See \"Life and Letters,\" II., pages 20, 21,\r\nfor Sir J.D. Hooker's notes on the beginning of his friendship with Mr.\r\nDarwin, and for the latter's letter on the Galapagos plants being placed\r\nin Hooker's hands.) (judging from Henslow's remarks) will turn out more\r\ninteresting than you expect. Pray be careful to observe, if I ever mark\r\nthe individual islands of the Galapagos Islands, for the reasons you\r\nwill see in my \"Journal.\" Menzies and Cumming were there, and there are\r\nsome plants (I think Mr. Bentham told me) at the Horticultural Society\r\nand at the British Museum. I believe I collected no plants at Ascension,\r\nthinking it well-known.\r\n\r\nIs not the similarity of plants of Kerguelen Land and southern S.\r\nAmerica very curious? Is there any instance in the northern hemisphere\r\nof plants being similar at such great distances? With thanks for your\r\nletter and for your having undertaken my small collection of plants,\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Sir, Yours very truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nDo remember my prayer, and write as well for botanical ignoramuses\r\nas for great botanists. There is a paper of Carmichael (313/3.\r\n\"Some Account of the Island of Tristan da Cunha and of its Natural\r\nProductions.\"--\"Linn. Soc. Trans.\" XII., 1818, page 483.) on Tristan\r\nd'Acunha, which from the want of general remarks and comparison, I found\r\n[torn out] to me a dead letter.--I presume you will include this island\r\nin your views of the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have been looking at my poor miserable attempt at\r\nbotanical-landscape-remarks, and I see that I state that the species of\r\nbeech which is least common in T. del Fuego is common in the forest of\r\nCentral Chiloe. But I will enclose for you this one page of my rough\r\njournal.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 314. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 31st (1844).\r\n\r\nI have been a shameful time in returning your documents, but I have been\r\nvery busy scientifically, and unscientifically in planting. I have been\r\nexceedingly interested in the details about the Galapagos Islands.\r\nI need not say that I collected blindly, and did not attempt to make\r\ncomplete series, but just took everything in flower blindly. The flora\r\nof the summits and bases of the islands appear wholly different; it may\r\naid you in observing whether the different islands have representative\r\nspecies filling the same places in the economy of nature, to know that I\r\ncollected plants from the lower and dry region in all the islands, i.e.,\r\nin the Chatham, Charles, James, and Albemarle (the least on the latter);\r\nand that I was able to ascend into the high and damp region only in\r\nJames and Charles Islands; and in the former I think I got every plant\r\nthen in flower. Please bear this in mind in comparing the representative\r\nspecies. (You know that Henslow has described a new Opuntia from the\r\nGalapagos.) Your observations on the distribution of large mundane\r\ngenera have interested me much; but that was not the precise point which\r\nI was curious to ascertain; it has no necessary relation to size of\r\ngenus (though perhaps your statements will show that it has). It was\r\nmerely this: suppose a genus with ten or more species, inhabiting the\r\nten main botanical regions, should you expect that all or most of these\r\nten species would have wide ranges (i.e. were found in most parts) in\r\ntheir respective countries? (314/1. This point is discussed in a letter\r\nin \"Life and Letters,\" Volume II., page 25, but not, we think in the\r\n\"Origin\"; for letters on large genera containing many varieties see\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" Volume II., pages 102-7, also in the \"Origin,\"\r\nEdition I., page 53, Edition VI., page 44. In a letter of April 5th,\r\n1844, Sir J.D. Hooker gave his opinion: \"On the whole I believe that\r\nmany individual representative species of large genera have wide ranges,\r\nbut I do not consider the fact as one of great value, because the\r\nproportion of such species having a wide range is not large compared\r\nwith other representative species of the same genus whose limits are\r\nconfined.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that in large genera the species often have small ranges\r\n(\"Origin,\" Edition VI., page 45), and large genera are more commonly\r\nwide-ranging than the reverse.) To give an example, the genus Felis\r\nis found in every country except Australia, and the individual species\r\ngenerally range over thousands of miles in their respective countries;\r\non the other hand, no genus of monkey ranges over so large a part of the\r\nworld, and the individual species in their respective countries seldom\r\nrange over wide spaces. I suspect (but am not sure) that in the genus\r\nMus (the most mundane genus of all mammifers) the individual species\r\nhave not wide ranges, which is opposed to my query.\r\n\r\nI fancy, from a paper by Don, that some genera of grasses (i.e. Juncus\r\nor Juncaceae) are widely diffused over the world, and certainly many of\r\ntheir species have very wide ranges--in short, it seems that my question\r\nis whether there is any relation between the ranges of genera and of\r\nindividual species, without any relation to the size of the genera. It\r\nis evident a genus might be widely diffused in two ways: 1st, by many\r\ndifferent species, each with restricted ranges; and 2nd, by many or\r\nfew species with wide ranges. Any light which you could throw on this I\r\nshould be very much obliged for. Thank you most kindly, also, for your\r\noffer in a former letter to consider any other points; and at some\r\nfuture day I shall be most grateful for a little assistance, but I will\r\nnot be unmerciful.\r\n\r\nSwainson has remarked (and Westwood contradicted) that typical genera\r\nhave wide ranges: Waterhouse (without knowing these previous\r\nremarkers) made to me the same observation: I feel a laudable doubt and\r\ndisinclination to believe any statement of Swainson; but now Waterhouse\r\nremarks it, I am curious on the point. There is, however, so much vague\r\nin the meaning of \"typical forms,\" and no little ambiguity in the mere\r\nassertion of \"wide ranges\" (for zoologists seldom go into strict and\r\ndisagreeable arithmetic, like you botanists so wisely do) that I feel\r\nvery doubtful, though some considerations tempt me to believe in this\r\nremark. Here again, if you can throw any light, I shall be much obliged.\r\nAfter your kind remarks I will not apologise for boring you with my\r\nvague queries and remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 315. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 25th [1844]. Happy Christmas\r\nto you.\r\n\r\n(315/1. The following letter refers to notes by Sir J.D. Hooker which we\r\nhave not seen. Though we are therefore unable to make clear many points\r\nreferred to, the letter seems to us on the whole so interesting that it\r\nis printed with the omission of only one unimportant sentence.\r\n\r\nThe subjects dealt with in the letter are those which were occupying\r\nHooker's attention in relation to his \"Flora Antarctica\" (1844).)\r\n\r\nI must thank you once again for all your documents, which have\r\ninterested me very greatly and surprised me. I found it very difficult\r\nto charge my head with all your tabulated results, but this I perfectly\r\nwell know is in main part due to that head not being a botanical one,\r\naided by the tables being in MS.; I think, however, to an ignoramus,\r\nthey might be made clearer; but pray mind, that this is very different\r\nfrom saying that I think botanists ought to arrange their highest\r\nresults for non-botanists to understand easily. I will tell you how,\r\nfor my individual self, I should like to see the results worked out, and\r\nthen you can judge, whether this be advisable for the botanical world.\r\n\r\nLooking at the globe, the Auckland and Campbell I., New Zealand, and\r\nVan Diemen's Land so evidently are geographically related, that I should\r\nwish, before any comparison was made with far more distant countries,\r\nto understand their floras, in relation to each other; and the southern\r\nones to the northern temperate hemisphere, which I presume is to every\r\none an almost involuntary standard of comparison. To understand the\r\nrelation of the floras of these islands, I should like to see the group\r\ndivided into a northern and southern half, and to know how many species\r\nexist in the latter--\r\n\r\n1. Belonging to genera confined to Australia, Van Diemen's Land and\r\nnorth New Zealand.\r\n\r\n2. Belonging to genera found only on the mountains of Australia, Van\r\nDiemen's Land, and north New Zealand.\r\n\r\n3. Belonging to genera of distribution in many parts of the world (i.e.,\r\nwhich tell no particular story).\r\n\r\n4. Belonging to genera found in the northern hemisphere and not in the\r\ntropics; or only on mountains in the tropics.\r\n\r\nI daresay all this (as far as present materials serve) could be\r\nextracted from your tables, as they stand; but to any one not familiar\r\nwith the names of plants, this would be difficult. I felt particularly\r\nthe want of not knowing which of the genera are found in the lowland\r\ntropics, in understanding the relation of the Antarctic with the Arctic\r\nfloras.\r\n\r\nIf the Fuegian flora was treated in the analogous way (and this would\r\nincidentally show how far the Cordillera are a high-road of genera), I\r\nshould then be prepared far more easily and satisfactorily to understand\r\nthe relations of Fuegia with the Auckland Islands, and consequently with\r\nthe mountains of Van Diemen's Land. Moreover, the marvellous facts\r\nof their intimate botanical relation (between Fuegia and the Auckland\r\nIslands, etc.) would stand out more prominently, after the Auckland\r\nIslands had been first treated of under the purely geographical relation\r\nof position. A triple division such as yours would lead me to suppose\r\nthat the three places were somewhat equally distant, and not so\r\ngreatly different in size: the relation of Van Diemen's Land seems so\r\ncomparatively small, and that relation being in its alpine plants, makes\r\nme feel that it ought only to be treated of as a subdivision of the\r\nlarge group, including Auckland, Campbell, New Zealand...\r\n\r\nI think a list of the genera, common to Fuegia on the one hand and on\r\nthe other to Campbell, etc., and to the mountains of Van Diemen's Land\r\nor New Zealand (but not found in the lowland temperate, and southern\r\ntropical parts of South America and Australia, or New Zealand), would\r\nprominently bring out, at the same time, the relation between these\r\nAntarctic points one with another, and with the northern or Arctic\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nIn Article III. is it meant to be expressed, or might it not be\r\nunderstood by this article, that the similarity of the distant points\r\nin the Antarctic regions was as close as between distant points in\r\nthe Arctic regions? I gather this is not so. You speak of the southern\r\npoints of America and Australia, etc., being \"materially approximated,\"\r\nand this closer proximity being correlative with a greater similarity of\r\ntheir plants: I find on the globe, that Van Diemen's Land and Fuegia are\r\nonly about one-fifth nearer than the whole distance between Port Jackson\r\nand Concepcion in Chile; and again, that Campbell Island and Fuegia\r\nare only one-fifth nearer than the east point of North New Zealand and\r\nConcepcion. Now do you think in such immense distances, both over open\r\noceans, that one-fifth less distance, say 4,000 miles instead of 5,000,\r\ncan explain or throw much light on a material difference in the degree\r\nof similarity in the floras of the two regions?\r\n\r\nI trust you will work out the New Zealand flora, as you have commenced\r\nat end of letter: is it not quite an original plan? and is it not very\r\nsurprising that New Zealand, so much nearer to Australia than South\r\nAmerica, should have an intermediate flora? I had fancied that nearly\r\nall the species there were peculiar to it. I cannot but think you make\r\none gratuitous difficulty in ascertaining whether New Zealand ought to\r\nbe classed by itself, or with Australia or South America--namely, when\r\nyou seem (bottom of page 7 of your letter) to say that genera in\r\ncommon indicate only that the external circumstances for their life are\r\nsuitable and similar. (315/2. On December 30th, 1844, Sir J.D. Hooker\r\nreplied, \"Nothing was further from my intention than to have written\r\nanything which would lead one to suppose that genera common to two\r\nplaces indicate a similarity in the external circumstances under which\r\nthey are developed, though I see I have given you excellent grounds for\r\nsupposing that such were my opinions.\") Surely, cannot an overwhelming\r\nmass of facts be brought against such a proposition? Distant parts of\r\nAustralia possess quite distinct species of marsupials, but surely this\r\nfact of their having the same marsupial genera is the strongest tie\r\nand plainest mark of an original (so-called) creative affinity over\r\nthe whole of Australia; no one, now, will (or ought) to say that the\r\ndifferent parts of Australia have something in their external conditions\r\nin common, causing them to be pre-eminently suitable to marsupials; and\r\nso on in a thousand instances. Though each species, and consequently\r\ngenus, must be adapted to its country, surely adaptation is manifestly\r\nnot the governing law in geographical distribution. Is this not so?\r\nand if I understand you rightly, you lessen your own means of\r\ncomparison--attributing the presence of the same genera to similarity of\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nYou will groan over my very full compliance with your request to write\r\nall I could on your tables, and I have done it with a vengeance: I can\r\nhardly say how valuable I must think your results will be, when worked\r\nout, as far as the present knowledge and collections serve.\r\n\r\nNow for some miscellaneous remarks on your letter: thanks for the offer\r\nto let me see specimens of boulders from Cockburn Island; but I care\r\nonly for boulders, as an indication of former climate: perhaps Ross will\r\ngive some information...\r\n\r\nWatson's paper on the Azores (315/3. H.C. Watson, \"London Journal of\r\nBotany,\" 1843-44.) has surprised me much; do you not think it odd, the\r\nfewness of peculiar species, and their rarity on the alpine heights? I\r\nwish he had tabulated his results; could you not suggest to him to draw\r\nup a paper of such results, comparing these Islands with Madeira? surely\r\ndoes not Madeira abound with peculiar forms?\r\n\r\nA discussion on the relations of the floras, especially the alpine ones,\r\nof Azores, Madeira, and Canary Islands, would be, I should think, of\r\ngeneral interest. How curious, the several doubtful species, which are\r\nreferred to by Watson, at the end of his paper; just as happens with\r\nbirds at the Galapagos...Any time that you can put me in the way of\r\nreading about alpine floras, I shall feel it as the greatest kindness. I\r\ngrieve there is no better authority for Bourbon, than that stupid Bory:\r\nI presume his remark that plants, on isolated volcanic islands are\r\npolymorphous (i.e., I suppose, variable?) is quite gratuitous. Farewell,\r\nmy dear Hooker. This letter is infamously unclear, and I fear can be of\r\nno use, except giving you the impression of a botanical ignoramus.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 316. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 19th [1845].\r\n\r\n...I was very glad to hear Humboldt's views on migrations and double\r\ncreations. It is very presumptuous, but I feel sure that though one\r\ncannot prove extensive migration, the leading considerations, proper to\r\nthe subject, are omitted, and I will venture to say even by Humboldt.\r\nI should like some time to put the case, like a lawyer, for your\r\nconsideration, in the point of view under which, I think, it ought to be\r\nviewed. The conclusion which I come to is, that we cannot pretend,\r\nwith our present knowledge, to put any limit to the possible, and even\r\nprobable, migration of plants. If you can show that many of the Fuegian\r\nplants, common to Europe, are found in intermediate points, it will be a\r\ngrand argument in favour of the actuality of migration; but not finding\r\nthem will not, in my eyes, much diminish the probability of their having\r\nthus migrated. My pen always runs away, in writing to you; and a most\r\nunsteady, vilely bad pace it goes. What would I not give to write simple\r\nEnglish, without having to rewrite and rewrite every sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 317. TO J.D. HOOKER. Friday [June 29th, 1845].\r\n\r\nI have been an ungrateful dog for not having answered your letter\r\nsooner, but I have been so hard at work correcting proofs (317/1. The\r\nsecond edition of the \"Journal.\"), together with some unwellness, that\r\nI have not had one quarter of an hour to spare. I finally corrected the\r\nfirst third of the old volume, which will appear on July 1st. I hope and\r\nthink I have somewhat improved it. Very many thanks for your remarks;\r\nsome of them came too late to make me put some of my remarks more\r\ncautiously. I feel, however, still inclined to abide by my evaporation\r\nnotion to account for the clouds of steam, which rise from the wooded\r\nvalleys after rain. Again, I am so obstinate that I should require very\r\ngood evidence to make me believe that there are two species of Polyborus\r\n(317/2. Polyborus Novae Zelandiae, a carrion hawk mentioned as very\r\ncommon in the Falklands.) in the Falkland Islands. Do the Gauchos there\r\nadmit it? Much as I talked to them, they never alluded to such a fact.\r\nIn the Zoology I have discussed the sexual and immature plumage, which\r\ndiffer much.\r\n\r\nI return the enclosed agreeable letter with many thanks. I am extremely\r\nglad of the plants collected at St. Paul's, and shall be particularly\r\ncurious whenever they arrive to hear what they are. I dined the other\r\nday at Sir J. Lubbock's, and met R. Brown, and we had much laudatory\r\ntalk about you. He spoke very nicely about your motives in now going\r\nto Edinburgh. He did not seem to know, and was much surprised at what I\r\nstated (I believe correctly) on the close relation between the Kerguelen\r\nand T. del Fuego floras. Forbes is doing apparently very good work about\r\nthe introduction and distribution of plants. He has forestalled me in\r\nwhat I had hoped would have been an interesting discussion--viz., on the\r\nrelation between the present alpine and Arctic floras, with connection\r\nto the last change of climate from Arctic to temperate, when the then\r\nArctic lowland plants must have been driven up the mountains. (317/3.\r\nForbes' Essay \"On the Connection between the Distribution of the\r\nExisting Fauna and Flora of the British Isles and the Geological Changes\r\nwhich have affected their Area,\" was published in 1846. See note, Letter\r\n20.)\r\n\r\nI am much pleased to hear of the pleasant reception you received at\r\nEdinburgh. (317/4. Sir J.D. Hooker was a candidate for the Chair of\r\nBotany at Edinburgh. See \"Life and Letters,\" I., pages 335, 342.) I\r\nhope your impressions will continue agreeable; my associations with auld\r\nReekie are very friendly. Do you ever see Dr. Coldstream? If you do,\r\nwould you give him my kind remembrances? You ask about amber. I believe\r\nall the species are extinct (i.e. without the amber has been doctored),\r\nand certainly the greater number are. (317/5. For an account of plants\r\nin amber see Goeppert and Berendt, \"Der Bernstein und die in ihm\r\nbefindlichen Pflanzenreste der Vorwelt,\" Berlin, 1845; Goeppert,\r\n\"Coniferen des Bernstein,\" Danzig, 1883; Conwentz, \"Monographie der\r\nBaltischen Bernsteinbaume,\" Danzig, 1890.)\r\n\r\nIf you have any other corrections ready, will you send them soon, for I\r\nshall go to press with second Part in less than a week. I have been\r\nso busy that I have not yet begun d'Urville, and have read only first\r\nchapter of Canary Islands! I am most particularly obliged to you for\r\nhaving lent me the latter, for I know not where else I could have ever\r\nborrowed it. There is the \"Kosmos\" to read, and Lyell's \"Travels in\r\nNorth America.\" It is awful to think of how much there is to read. What\r\nmakes H. Watson a renegade? I had a talk with Captain Beaufort the other\r\nday, and he charged me to keep a book and enter anything which occurred\r\nto me, which deserved examination or collection in any part of the\r\nworld, and he would sooner or later get it in the instructions to some\r\nship. If anything occurs to you let me hear, for in the course of a\r\nmonth or two I must write out something. I mean to urge collections of\r\nall kinds on any isolated islands. I suspect that there are several in\r\nthe northern half of the Pacific, which have never been visited by a\r\ncollector. This is a dull, untidy letter. Farewell.\r\n\r\nAs you care so much for insular floras, are you aware that I collected\r\nall in flower on the Abrolhos Islands? but they are very near the coast\r\nof Brazil. Nevertheless, I think they ought to be just looked at, under\r\na geographical point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 318. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November [1845].\r\n\r\nI have just got as far as Lycopodium in your Flora, and, in truth,\r\ncannot say enough how much I have been interested in all your scattered\r\nremarks. I am delighted to have in print many of the statements which\r\nyou made in your letters to me, when we were discussing some of the\r\ngeographical points. I can never cease marvelling at the similarity of\r\nthe Antarctic floras: it is wonderful. I hope you will tabulate all\r\nyour results, and put prominently what you allude to (and what is\r\npre-eminently wanted by non-botanists like myself), which of the genera\r\nare, and which not, found in the lowland or in the highland Tropics, as\r\nfar as known. Out of the very many new observations to me, nothing\r\nhas surprised me more than the absence of Alpine floras in the S[outh]\r\nIslands. (318/1. See \"Flora Antarctica,\" I., page 79, where the author\r\nsays that \"in the South...on ascending the mountains, few or no new\r\nforms occur.\" With regard to the Sandwich Islands, Sir Joseph wrote\r\n(page 75) that \"though the volcanic islands of the Sandwich group\r\nattain a greater elevation than this [10,000 feet], there is no such\r\ndevelopment of new species at the upper level.\" More recent statements\r\nto the same effect occur in Grisebach, \"Vegetation der Erde,\" Volume\r\nII., page 530. See also Wallace, \"Island Life,\" page 307.) It strikes me\r\nas most inexplicable. Do you feel sure about the similar absence in the\r\nSandwich group? Is it not opposed quite to the case of Teneriffe and\r\nMadeira, and Mediterranean Islands? I had fancied that T. del Fuego had\r\npossessed a large alpine flora! I should much like to know whether\r\nthe climate of north New Zealand is much more insular than Tasmania. I\r\nshould doubt it from general appearance of places, and yet I presume the\r\nflora of the former is far more scanty than of Tasmania. Do tell me what\r\nyou think on this point. I have also been particularly interested by\r\nall your remarks on variation, affinities, etc.: in short, your book has\r\nbeen to me a most valuable one, and I must have purchased it had you not\r\nmost kindly given it, and so rendered it even far more valuable to me.\r\nWhen you compare a species to another, you sometimes do not mention\r\nthe station of the latter (it being, I presume, well-known), but\r\nto non-botanists such words of explanation would add greatly to\r\nthe interest--not that non-botanists have any claim at all for such\r\nexplanations in professedly botanical works. There is one expression\r\nwhich you botanists often use (though, I think, not you individually\r\noften), which puts me in a passion--viz., calling polleniferous flowers\r\n\"sterile,\" as non-seed-bearing. (318/2. See Letter 16.) Are the plates\r\nfrom your own drawings? They strike me as excellent. So now you have had\r\nmy presumptuous commendations on your great work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 319. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Friday [1845-6].\r\n\r\nIt is quite curious how our opinions agree about Forbes' views. (319/1.\r\nSee Letter 20.) I was very glad to have your last letter, which was even\r\nmore valuable to me than most of yours are, and that is saying, I assure\r\nyou, a great deal. I had written to Forbes to object about the Azores\r\n(319/2. Edward Forbes supposed that the Azores, the Madeiras, and\r\nCanaries \"are the last remaining fragments\" of a continent which\r\nonce connected them with Western Europe and Northern Spain. Lyell's\r\n\"Principles,\" Edition XI., Volume II., page 410. See Forbes, op. cit.)\r\non the same grounds as you had, and he made some answer, which partially\r\nsatisfied me, but really I am so stupid I cannot remember it. He\r\ninsisted strongly on the fewness of the species absolutely peculiar to\r\nthe Azores--most of the non-European species being common to Madeira. I\r\nhad thought that a good sprinkling were absolutely peculiar. Till I saw\r\nhim last Wednesday I thought he had not a leg to stand on in his geology\r\nabout his post-Miocene land; and his reasons, upon reflection, seem\r\nrather weak: the main one is that there are no deposits (more recent\r\nthan the Miocene age) on the Miocene strata of Malta, etc., but I feel\r\npretty sure that this cannot be trusted as evidence that Malta must have\r\nbeen above water during all the post-Miocene period. He had one other\r\nreason, to my mind still less trustworthy. I had also written to Forbes,\r\nbefore your letter, objecting to the Sargassum (319/3. Edward Forbes\r\nsupposed that the Sargassum or Gulf-weed represents the littoral\r\nsea-weeds of a now submerged continent. \"Mem. Geol. Survey Great\r\nBritain,\" Volume I., 1846, page 349. See Lyell's \"Principles,\" II., page\r\n396, Edition XI.), but apparently on wrong grounds, for I could see no\r\nreason, on the common view of absolute creations, why one Fucus should\r\nnot have been created for the ocean, as well as several Confervae for\r\nthe same end. It is really a pity that Forbes is quite so speculative:\r\nhe will injure his reputation, anyhow, on the Continent; and thus will\r\ndo less good. I find this is the opinion of Falconer, who was with us\r\non Sunday, and was extremely agreeable. It is wonderful how much\r\nheterogeneous information he has about all sorts of things. I the more\r\nregret Forbes cannot more satisfactorily prove his views, as I heartily\r\nwish they were established, and to a limited extent I fully believe they\r\nare true; but his boldness is astounding. Do I understand your letter\r\nright, that West Africa (319/4. This is of course a misunderstanding.)\r\nand Java belong to the same botanical region--i.e., that they have many\r\nnon-littoral species in common? If so, it is a sickening fact: think of\r\nthe distance with the Indian Ocean interposed! Do some time answer me\r\nthis. With respect to polymorphism, which you have been so very kind as\r\nto give me so much information on, I am quite convinced it must be given\r\nup in the sense you have discussed it in; but from such cases as the\r\nGalapagos birds and from hypothetical notions on variation, I should be\r\nvery glad to know whether it must be given up in a slightly different\r\npoint of view; that is, whether the peculiar insular species are\r\ngenerally well and strongly distinguishable from the species on the\r\nnearest continent (when there is a continent near); the Galapagos,\r\nCanary Islands, and Madeira ought to answer this. I should have\r\nhypothetically expected that a good many species would have been\r\nfine ones, like some of the Galapagos birds, and still more so on the\r\ndifferent islands of such groups.\r\n\r\nI am going to ask you some questions, but I should really sometimes\r\nalmost be glad if you did not answer me for a long time, or not at all,\r\nfor in honest truth I am often ashamed at, and marvel at, your kindness\r\nin writing such long letters to me. So I beg you to mind, never to\r\nwrite to me when it bores you. Do you know \"Elements de Teratologie (on\r\nmonsters, I believe) Vegetale,\" par A. Moquin Tandon\"? (319/5.\r\nParis, 1841.) Is it a good book, and will it treat on hereditary\r\nmalconformations or varieties? I have almost finished the tremendous\r\ntask of 850 pages of A. St. Hilaire's Lectures (319/6. \"Lecons de\r\nBotanique,\" 1841.), which you set me, and very glad I am that you told\r\nme to read it, for I have been much interested with parts. Certain\r\nexpressions which run through the whole work put me in a passion: thus I\r\ntake, at hazard, \"la plante n'etait pas tout a fait ASSEZ AFFAIBLIE\r\npour produire de veritables carpelles.\" Every organ or part concerned in\r\nreproduction--that highest end of all lower organisms--is, according to\r\nthis man, produced by a lesser or greater degree of \"affaiblissement\";\r\nand if that is not an AFFAIBLISSEMENT of language, I don't know what is.\r\nI have used an expression here, which leads me to ask another question:\r\non what sort of grounds do botanists make one family of plants higher\r\nthan another? I can see that the simplest cryptogamic are lowest, and I\r\nsuppose, from their relations, the monocotyledonous come next; but how\r\nin the different families of the dicotyledons? The point seems to me\r\nequally obscure in many races of animals, and I know not how to tell\r\nwhether a bee or cicindela is highest. (319/7. On use of terms \"high\"\r\nand \"low\" see Letters 36 and 70.) I see Aug. Hilaire uses a multiplicity\r\nof parts--several circles of stamens, etc.--as evidence of the highness\r\nof the Ranunculaceae; now Owen has truly, as I believe, used the same\r\nargument to show the lowness of some animals, and has established the\r\nproposition, that the fewer the number of any organ, as legs or wings or\r\nteeth, by which the same end is gained, the higher the animal. One other\r\nquestion. Hilaire says (page 572) that \"chez une foule de plantes\r\nc'est dans le bouton,\" that impregnation takes place. He instances only\r\nGoodenia (319/8. For letters on this point, see Index s.v. Goodenia.),\r\nand Falconer cannot recollect any cases. Do you know any of this \"foule\"\r\nof plants? From reasons, little better than hypothetical, I greatly\r\nmisdoubt the accuracy of this, presumptuous as it is; that plants shed\r\ntheir pollen in the bud is, of course, quite a different story. Can you\r\nilluminate me? Henslow will send the Galapagos scraps to you. I direct\r\nthis to Kew, as I suppose, after your sister's marriage (on which I beg\r\nto send you my congratulations), you will return home.\r\n\r\nThere are great fears that Falconer will have to go out to India--this\r\nwill be a grievous loss to Palaeontology.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 320. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 10th [1846].\r\n\r\nI was much pleased to see and sign your certificate for the Geolog[ical\r\nSociety]; we shall thus occasionally, I hope, meet. (320/1. Sir Joseph\r\nwas elected a Fellow of the Geological Society in 1846.)\r\n\r\nI have been an ungrateful dog not to have thanked you before this for\r\nthe cake and books. The children and their betters pronounced the former\r\nexcellent, and Annie wanted to know whether it was the gentleman \"what\r\nplayed with us so.\" I wish we were at a more reasonable distance,\r\nthat Emma and myself could have called on Lady Hooker with our\r\ncongratulations on this occasion. It was very good of you to put in\r\nboth numbers of the \"Hort. Journal.\" I think Dean Herbert's article well\r\nworth reading. I have been so extravagant as to order M[oquin] Tandon\r\n(320/2. Probably \"Elements de Teratologie Vegetale\": Paris, 1841.),\r\nfor though I have not found, as yet, anything particularly novel or\r\nstriking, yet I found that I wished to score a good many passages so as\r\nto re-read them at some future time, and hence have ordered the book.\r\nConsequently I hope soon to send back your books. I have sent off the\r\nAscension plants through Bunsen to Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\nThere was much in your last long letter which interested me much; and I\r\nam particularly glad that you are going to attend to polymorphism in\r\nour last and incorrect sense in your works; I see that it must be most\r\ndifficult to take any sort of constant limit for the amount of possible\r\nvariation. How heartily I do wish that all your works were out and\r\ncomplete; so that I could quietly think over them. I fear the Pacific\r\nIslands must be far distant in futurity. I fear, indeed, that Forbes is\r\ngoing rather too quickly ahead; but we shall soon see all his grounds,\r\nas I hear he is now correcting the press on this subject; he has plenty\r\nof people who attack him; I see Falconer never loses a chance, and it\r\nis wonderful how well Forbes stands it. What a very striking fact is the\r\nbotanical relation between Africa and Java; as you now state it, I\r\nam pleased rather than disgusted, for it accords capitally with\r\nthe distribution of the mammifers (320/3. See Wallace, \"Geogr.\r\nDistribution,\" Volume I., page 263, on the \"special Oriental or even\r\nMalayan element\" in the West African mammals and birds.): only that I\r\njudge from your letters that the Cape differs even more markedly than I\r\nhad thought, from the rest of Africa, and much more than the mammifers\r\ndo. I am surprised to find how well mammifers and plants seem to accord\r\nin their general distribution. With respect to my strong objection to\r\nAug. St. Hilaire's language on AFFAIBLISSEMENT (320/4. This refers to\r\nhis \"Lecons de Botanique (Morphologie Vegetale),\" 1841. Saint-Hilaire\r\noften explains morphological differences as due to differences in\r\nvigour. See Letter 319.), it is perhaps hardly rational, and yet he\r\nconfesses that some of the most vigorous plants in nature have some of\r\ntheir organs struck with this weakness--he does not pretend, of course,\r\nthat they were ever otherwise in former generations--or that a more\r\nvigorously growing plant produces organs less weakened, and thus fails\r\nin producing its typical structure. In a plant in a state of nature,\r\ndoes cutting off the sap tend to produce flower-buds? I know it does in\r\ntrees in orchards. Owen has been doing some grand work in the morphology\r\nof the vertebrata: your arm and hand are parts of your head, or rather\r\nthe processes (i.e. modified ribs) of the occipital vertebra! He gave me\r\na grand lecture on a cod's head. By the way, would it not strike you as\r\nmonstrous, if in speaking of the minute and lessening jaws, palpi, etc.,\r\nof an insect or crustacean, any one were to say they were produced\r\nby the affaiblissement of the less important but larger organs of\r\nlocomotion. I see from your letter (though I do not suppose it is worth\r\nreferring to the subject) that I could not have expressed what I meant\r\nwhen I allowed you to infer that Owen's rule of single organs being of\r\na higher order than multiple organs applied only to locomotive, etc.; it\r\napplies to every the most important organ. I do not doubt that he would\r\nsay the placentata having single wombs, whilst the marsupiata have\r\ndouble ones, is an instance of this law. I believe, however, in most\r\ninstances where one organ, as a nervous centre or heart, takes the\r\nplaces of several, it rises in complexity; but it strikes me as really\r\nodd, seeing in this instance eminent botanists and zoologists starting\r\nfrom reverse grounds. Pray kindly bear in mind about impregnation in\r\nbud: I have never (for some years having been on the look-out) heard of\r\nan instance: I have long wished to know how it was in Subularia, or some\r\nsuch name, which grows on the bottom of Scotch lakes, and likewise in a\r\ngrassy plant, which lives in brackish water, I quite forget name, near\r\nThames; elder botanists doubted whether it was a Phanerogam. When we\r\nmeet I will tell you why I doubt this bud-impregnation.\r\n\r\nWe are at present in a state of utmost confusion, as we have pulled\r\nall our offices down and are going to rebuild and alter them. I am\r\npersonally in a state of utmost confusion also, for my cruel wife has\r\npersuaded me to leave off snuff for a month; and I am most lethargic,\r\nstupid, and melancholy in consequence.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my dear Hooker. Ever yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 321. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 19th [1855].\r\n\r\nThank you for your list of R.S. candidates, which will be very useful to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI have thought a good deal about my salting experiments (321/1. For\r\nan account of Darwin's experiments on the effect of salt water on the\r\ngermination of seeds, see \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 54. In April\r\nhe wrote to the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" asking for information, and his\r\nresults were published in the same journal, May 26th and November 24th,\r\n1855; also in the \"Linn. Soc. Journal,\" 1857.), and really think they\r\nare worth pursuing to a certain extent; but I hardly see the use\r\n(at least, the use equivalent to the enormous labour) of trying the\r\nexperiment on the immense scale suggested by you. I should think a\r\nfew seeds of the leading orders, or a few seeds of each of the classes\r\nmentioned by you, with albumen of different kinds would suffice to show\r\nthe possibility of considerable sea-transportal. To tell whether any\r\nparticular insular flora had thus been transported would require that\r\neach species should be examined. Will you look through these printed\r\nlists, and if you can, mark with red cross such as you would suggest? In\r\ntruth, I fear I impose far more on your great kindness, my dear Hooker,\r\nthan I have any claim; but you offered this, for I never thought of\r\nasking you for more than a suggestion. I do not think I could manage\r\nmore than forty or fifty kinds at a time, for the water, I find, must\r\nbe renewed every other day, as it gets to smell horribly: and I do not\r\nthink your plan good of little packets of cambric, as this entangles\r\nso much air. I shall keep the great receptacle with salt water with\r\nthe forty or fifty little bottles, partly open, immersed in it, in the\r\ncellar for uniform temperature. I must plant out of doors, as I have no\r\ngreenhouse.\r\n\r\nI told you I had inserted notice in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" and\r\nto-day I have heard from Berkeley that he has already sent an assortment\r\nof seeds to Margate for some friend to put in salt water; so I suppose\r\nhe thinks the experiment worth trying, as he has thus so very promptly\r\ntaken it into his own hands. (321/2. Rev. M.J. Berkeley published on the\r\nsubject in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" September 1st, 1855.)\r\n\r\nReading this over, it sounds as if I were offended!!! which I need not\r\nsay is not so. (321/3. Added afterwards between the lines.)\r\n\r\nI may just mention that the seeds mentioned in my former note have all\r\ngerminated after fourteen days' immersion, except the cabbages all dead,\r\nand the radishes have had their germination delayed and several I think\r\ndead; cress still all most vigorous. French spinach, oats, barley,\r\ncanary-seed, borage, beet have germinated after seven days' immersion.\r\n\r\nIt is quite surprising that the radishes should have grown, for the salt\r\nwater was putrid to an extent which I could not have thought credible\r\nhad I not smelt it myself, as was the water with the cabbage-seed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 322. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, June 10th [1855].\r\n\r\nIf being thoroughly interested with your letters makes me worthy of\r\nthem, I am very worthy.\r\n\r\nI have raised some seedling Sensitive Plants, but if you can READILY\r\nspare me a moderately sized plant, I shall be glad of it.\r\n\r\nYou encourage me so, that I will slowly go on salting seeds. I have\r\nnot, I see, explained myself, to let you suppose that I objected to such\r\ncases as the former union of England and the Continent; I look at this\r\ncase as proved by animals, etc., etc.; and, indeed, it would be an\r\nastounding fact if the land had kept so steady as that they had not been\r\nunited, with Snowdon elevated 1,300 feet in recent times, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIt is only against the former union with the oceanic volcanic islands\r\nthat I am vehement. (322/1. See \"Life and Letters,\" Volume II., pages\r\n72, 74, 80, 109.) What a perplexing case New Zealand does seem: is\r\nnot the absence of Leguminosae, etc., etc., FULLY as much opposed to\r\ncontinental connexion as to any other theory? What a curious fact you\r\nstate about distribution and lowness going together.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a frog in New Zealand seems to me a strongish fact for\r\ncontinental connexion, for I assume that sea water would kill spawn, but\r\nI shall try. The spawn, I find, will live about ten days out of water,\r\nbut I do not think it could possibly stick to a bird.\r\n\r\nWhat you say about no one realising creation strikes me as very true;\r\nbut I think and hope that there is nearly as much difference between\r\ntrying to find out whether species of a genus have had a common ancestor\r\nand concerning oneself with the first origin of life, as between making\r\nout the laws of chemical attraction and the first origin of matter.\r\n\r\nI thought that Gray's letter had come open to you, and that you had read\r\nit: you will see what I asked--viz., for habitats of the alpine plants,\r\nbut I presume there will be nothing new to you. Please return both. How\r\npleasantly Gray takes my request, and I think I shall have done a good\r\nturn if I make him write a paper on geographical distribution of plants\r\nof United States.\r\n\r\nI have written him a very long letter, telling him some of the points\r\nabout which I should feel curious. But on my life it is sublimely\r\nridiculous, my making suggestions to such a man.\r\n\r\nI cannot help thinking that what you say about low plants being widely\r\ndistributed and standing injurious conditions better than higher ones\r\n(but is not this most difficult to show?) is equally favourable to\r\nsea-transport, to continental connexions, and all other means. Pray\r\ndo not suppose that I fancy that if I could show that nearly all seeds\r\ncould stand an almost indefinite period of immersion in sea-water, that\r\nI have done more than one EXTREMELY SMALL step in solving the problem of\r\ndistribution, for I can quite appreciate the importance of the fact you\r\npoint out; and then the directions of currents in past and present times\r\nhave to be considered!!\r\n\r\nI shall be very curious to hear Berkeley's results in the salting line.\r\n\r\nWith respect to geological changes, I ought to be one of the last men\r\nto undervalue them after my map of coral islands, and after what I have\r\nseen of elevation on coast of America. Farewell. I hope my letters do\r\nnot bother you. Again, and for the last time, I say that I should be\r\nextremely vexed if ever you write to me against the grain or when tired.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 323. TO J.S HENSLOW. Down, July 2nd [1855].\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for all you have done, and so very kindly promise to do\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nWill you make a present to each of the little girls (if not too big\r\nand grandiose) of six pence (for which I send stamps), who are going to\r\ncollect seeds for me: viz., Lychnis, white, red, and flesh-colour (if\r\nsuch occur).\r\n\r\n...Will you be so kind as to look at them before sent, just to see\r\npositively that they are correct, for remember how ignorant botanically\r\nI am.\r\n\r\nDo you see the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" and did you notice some little\r\nexperiments of mine on salting seeds? Celery and onion seed have come up\r\nafter eighty-five days' immersion in the salt water, which seems to\r\nme surprising, and I think throws some light on the wide dispersion\r\nof certain plants. Now, it has occurred to me that it would be an\r\ninteresting way of testing the probability of sea-transportal of seeds,\r\nto make a list of all the European plants found in the Azores--a very\r\noceanic archipelago--collect the seeds, and try if they would stand a\r\npretty long immersion. Do you think the most able of your little girls\r\nwould like to collect for me a packet of seeds of such Azorean plants as\r\ngrow near Hitcham, I paying, say 3 pence for each packet: it would put a\r\nfew shillings into their pockets, and would be an enormous advantage\r\nto me, for I grudge the time to collect the seeds, more especially as I\r\nhave to learn the plants! The experiment seems to me worth trying: what\r\ndo you think? Should you object offering for me this reward or payment\r\nto your little girls? You would have to select the most conscientious\r\nones, that I might not get wrong seeds. I have just been comparing the\r\nlists, and I suspect you would not have very many of the Azorean plants.\r\nYou have, however,\r\n\r\n     Ranunculus repens,\r\n     Ranunculus parviflorus,\r\n     Papaver rhoeas,?\r\n     Papaver dubium,?\r\n     Chelidonium majus,?\r\n     Fumaria officinalis.?\r\n\r\nAll these are Azorean plants.\r\n\r\nWith respect to cultivating plants, I mean to begin on very few, for\r\nI may find it too troublesome. I have already had for some months\r\nprimroses and cowslips, strongly manured with guano, and with flowers\r\npicked off, and one cowslip made to grow in shade; and next spring I\r\nshall collect seed.\r\n\r\nI think you have quite misunderstood me in regard to my object in\r\ngetting you to mark in accompanying list with (x) all the \"close\r\nspecies\" (323/1. See Letter 279.) i.e., such as you do not think to\r\nbe varieties, but which nevertheless are very closely allied; it has\r\nnothing whatever to do with their cultivation, but I cannot tell you\r\n[my] object, as it might unconsciously influence you in marking them.\r\nWill you draw your pencil right through all the names of those (few)\r\nspecies, of which you may know nothing. Afterwards, when done, I will\r\ntell you my object--not that it is worth telling, though I myself am\r\nvery curious on the subject. I know and can perceive that the definition\r\nof \"close species\" is very vague, and therefore I should not care for\r\nthe list being marked by any one, except by such as yourself.\r\n\r\nForgive this long letter. I thank you heartily for all your assistance.\r\n\r\nMy dear old Master, Yours affectionately, C. Darwin.\r\n\r\nPerhaps 3 pence would be hardly enough, and if the number of kinds does\r\nnot turn out very great it shall be 6 pence per packet.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 324. ASA GRAY TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(324/1. In reply to Darwin's letter, June 8th, 1855, given in \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" II., page 61.)\r\n\r\nHarvard University, Cambridge, U.S., June 30th, 1855.\r\n\r\nYour long letter of the 8th inst. is full of interest to me, and I shall\r\nfollow out your hints as far as I can. I rejoice in furnishing facts to\r\nothers to work up in their bearing on general questions, and feel it the\r\nmore my duty to do so inasmuch as from preoccupation of mind and\r\ntime and want of experience I am unable to contribute direct original\r\ninvestigations of the sort to the advancement of science.\r\n\r\nYour request at the close of your letter, which you have such needless\r\nhesitation in making, is just the sort of one which it is easy for me to\r\nreply to, as it lies directly in my way. It would probably pass out of\r\nmy mind, however, at the time you propose, so I will attend to it at\r\nonce, to fill up the intervals of time left me while attending to one or\r\ntwo pupils. So I take some unbound sheets of a copy of the \"Manual,\" and\r\nmark off the \"close species\" by connecting them with a bracket.\r\n\r\nThose thus connected, some of them, I should in revision unite under\r\none, many more Dr. Hooker would unite, and for the rest it would not\r\nbe extraordinary if, in any case, the discovery of intermediate forms\r\ncompelled their union.\r\n\r\nAs I have noted on the blank page of the sheets I send you (through Sir\r\nWilliam Hooker), I suppose that if we extended the area, say to that of\r\nour flora of North America, we should find that the proportion of \"close\r\nspecies\" to the whole flora increased considerably. But here I speak at\r\na venture. Some day I will test it for a few families.\r\n\r\nIf you take for comparison with what I send you, the \"British Flora,\"\r\nor Koch's \"Flora Germanica,\" or Godron's \"Flora of France,\" and mark the\r\n\"close species\" on the same principle, you will doubtless find a much\r\ngreater number. Of course you will not infer from this that the two\r\nfloras differ in this respect; since the difference is probably owing to\r\nthe facts that (1) there have not been so many observers here bent upon\r\ndetecting differences; and (2) our species, thanks mostly to Dr. Torrey\r\nand myself, have been more thoroughly castigated. What stands for one\r\nspecies in the \"Manual\" would figure in almost any European flora as\r\ntwo, three, or more, in a very considerable number of cases.\r\n\r\nIn boldly reducing nominal species J. Hooker is doing a good work;\r\nbut his vocation--like that of any other reformer--exposes him to\r\ntemptations and dangers.\r\n\r\nBecause you have shown that a and b are so connected by intermediate\r\nforms that we cannot do otherwise than regard them as variations of one\r\nspecies, we may not conclude that c and d, differing much in the same\r\nway and to the same degree, are of one species, before an equal amount\r\nof evidence is actually obtained. That is, when two sets of individuals\r\nexhibit any grave differences, the burden of proof of their common\r\norigin lies with the person who takes that view; and each case must be\r\ndecided on its own evidence, and not on analogy, if our conclusions\r\nin this way are to be of real value. Of course we must often jump at\r\nconclusions from imperfect evidence. I should like to write an essay on\r\nspecies some day; but before I should have time to do it, in my plodding\r\nway, I hope you or Hooker will do it, and much better far. I am most\r\nglad to be in conference with Hooker and yourself on these matters, and\r\nI think we may, or rather you may, in a few years settle the question as\r\nto whether Agassiz's or Hooker's views are correct; they are certainly\r\nwidely different.\r\n\r\nApropos to this, many thanks for the paper containing your experiments\r\non seeds exposed to sea water. Why has nobody thought of trying the\r\nexperiment before, instead of taking it for granted that salt water\r\nkills seeds? I shall have it nearly all reprinted in \"Silliman's\r\nJournal\" as a nut for Agassiz to crack.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 325. TO ASA GRAY. Down, May 2nd [1856?]\r\n\r\nI have received your very kind note of April 8th. In truth it is\r\npreposterous in me to give you hints; but it will give me real pleasure\r\nto write to you just as I talk to Hooker, who says my questions\r\nare sometimes suggestive owing to my comparing the ranges, etc., in\r\ndifferent kingdoms of Nature. I will make no further apologies about my\r\npresumption; but will just tell you (though I am certain there will be\r\nVERY little new in what I suggest and ask) the points on which I am very\r\nanxious to hear about. I forget whether you include Arctic America, but\r\nif so, for comparison with other parts of world, I would exclude the\r\nArctic and Alpine-Arctic, as belonging to a quite distinct category.\r\nWhen excluding the naturalised, I think De Candolle must be right in\r\nadvising the exclusion (giving list) of plants exclusively found\r\nin cultivated land, even when it is not known that they have been\r\nintroduced by man. I would give list of temperate plants (if any) found\r\nin Eastern Asia, China, and Japan, and not elsewhere. Nothing would give\r\nme a better idea of the flora of United States than the proportion of\r\nits genera to all the genera which are confined to America; and the\r\nproportion of genera confined to America and Eastern Asia with Japan;\r\nthe remaining genera would be common to America and Europe and the rest\r\nof world; I presume it would be impossible to show any especial affinity\r\nin genera, if ever so few, between America and Western Europe. America\r\nmight be related to Eastern Asia (always excluding Arctic forms) by a\r\ngenus having the same species confined to these two regions; or it might\r\nbe related by the genus having different species, the genus itself not\r\nbeing found elsewhere. The relation of the genera (excluding identical\r\nspecies) seems to me a most important element in geographical\r\ndistribution often ignored, and I presume of more difficult application\r\nin plants than in animals, owing to the wider ranges of plants; but I\r\nfind in New Zealand (from Hooker) that the consideration of genera with\r\nrepresentative species tells the story of relationship even plainer than\r\nthe identity of the species with the different parts of the world. I\r\nshould like to see the genera of the United States, say 500 (excluding\r\nArctic and Alpine) divided into three classes, with the proportions\r\ngiven thus:--\r\n\r\n100/500 American genera;\r\n\r\n200/500 Old World genera, but not having any identical species in\r\ncommon;\r\n\r\n200/500 Old World genera, but having some identical species in common;\r\n\r\nSupposing that these 200 genera included 600 U.S. plants, then the 600\r\nwould be the denominator to the fraction of the species common to the\r\nOld World. But I am running on at a foolish length.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting discussion in De Candolle (about pages 503-514)\r\non the relation of the size of families to the average range of\r\nthe individual species; I cannot but think, from some facts which I\r\ncollected long before De Candolle appeared, that he is on wrong scent in\r\nhaving taken families (owing to their including too great a diversity\r\nin the constitution of the species), but that if he had taken genera, he\r\nwould have found that the individual species in large genera range over\r\na greater area than do the species in small genera: I think if you have\r\nmaterials that this would be well worth working out, for it is a very\r\nsingular relation.\r\n\r\nWith respect to naturalised plants: are any social with you, which are\r\nnot so in their parent country? I am surprised that the importance of\r\nthis has not more struck De Candolle. Of these naturalised plants are\r\nany or many more variable in your opinion than the average of your\r\nUnited States plants? I am aware how very vague this must be; but\r\nDe Candolle has stated that the naturalised plants do not present\r\nvarieties; but being very variable and presenting distinct varieties\r\nseems to me rather a different case: if you would kindly take the\r\ntrouble to answer this question I should be very much obliged, whether\r\nor no you will enter on such points in your essay.\r\n\r\nWith respect to such plants, which have their southern limits within\r\nyour area, are the individuals ever or often stunted in their growth\r\nor unhealthy? I have in vain endeavoured to find any botanist who has\r\nobserved this point; but I have seen some remarks by Barton on the\r\ntrees in United States. Trees seem in this respect to behave rather\r\ndifferently from other plants.\r\n\r\nIt would be a very curious point, but I fear you would think it out of\r\nyour essay, to compare the list of European plants in Tierra del Fuego\r\n(in Hooker) with those in North America; for, without multiple creation,\r\nI think we must admit that all now in T. del Fuego must have travelled\r\nthrough North America, and so far they do concern you.\r\n\r\nThe discussion on social plants (vague as the terms and facts are) in\r\nDe Candolle strikes me as the best which I have ever seen: two points\r\nstrike me as eminently remarkable in them; that they should ever be\r\nsocial close to their extreme limits; and secondly, that species having\r\nan extremely confined range, yet should be social where they do occur: I\r\nshould be infinitely obliged for any cases either by letter or publicly\r\non these heads, more especially in regard to a species remaining or\r\nceasing to be social on the confines of its range.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point on which I individually should be extremely\r\nmuch obliged, if you could spare the time to think a little bit and\r\ninform me: viz., whether there are any cases of the same species being\r\nmore variable in United States than in other countries in which it\r\nis found, or in different parts of the United States? Wahlenberg says\r\ngenerally that the same species in going south become more variable than\r\nin extreme north. Even still more am I anxious to know whether any of\r\nthe genera, which have most of their species horribly variable (as\r\nRubus or Hieracium are) in Europe, or other parts of the world, are less\r\nvariable in the United States; or, the reverse case, whether you have\r\nany odious genera with you which are less odious in other countries? Any\r\ninformation on this head would be a real kindness to me.\r\n\r\nI suppose your flora is too great; but a simple list in close columns in\r\nsmall type of all the species, genera, and families, each consecutively\r\nnumbered, has always struck me as most useful; and Hooker regrets that\r\nhe did not give such list in introduction to New Zealand and other\r\nFlora. I am sure I have given you a larger dose of questions than you\r\nbargained for, and I have kept my word and treated you just as I do\r\nHooker. Nevertheless, if anything occurs to me during the next two\r\nmonths, I will write freely, believing that you will forgive me and not\r\nthink me very presumptuous.\r\n\r\nHow well De Candolle shows the necessity of comparing nearly equal areas\r\nfor proportion of families!\r\n\r\nI have re-read this letter, and it is really not worth sending, except\r\nfor my own sake. I see I forgot, in beginning, to state that it appeared\r\nto me that the six heads of your Essay included almost every point which\r\ncould be desired, and therefore that I had little to say.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 326. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(326/1. On July 5th, 1856, Darwin wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"I am going mad and am in despair over your confounded Antarctic island\r\nflora. Will you read over the Tristan list, and see if my remarks on it\r\nare at all accurate. I cannot make out why you consider the vegetation\r\nso Fuegian.\")\r\n\r\nDown, 8th [July, 1856].\r\n\r\nI do hope that this note may arrive in time to save you trouble in one\r\nrespect. I am perfectly ashamed of myself, for I find in introduction to\r\nFlora of Fuegia (326/2. \"Flora Antarctica,\" page 216. \"Though only 1,000\r\nmiles distant from the Cape of Good Hope, and 3,000 from the Strait of\r\nMagalhaens, the botany of this island [Tristan d'Acunha] is far more\r\nintimately allied to that of Fuegia than Africa.\" Hooker goes on to say\r\nthat only Phylica and Pelargonium are Cape forms, while seven species,\r\nor one-quarter of the flora, \"are either natives of Fuegia or typical\r\nof South American botany, and the ferns and Lycopodia exhibit a still\r\nstronger affinity.\") a short discussion on Tristan plants, which though\r\nscored [i.e. marked in pencil] I had quite forgotten at the time, and\r\nhad thought only of looking into introduction to New Zealand Flora. It\r\nwas very stupid of me. In my sketch I am forced to pick out the most\r\nstriking cases of species which favour the multiple creation doctrine,\r\nwithout indeed great continental extensions are admitted. Of the many\r\nwonderful cases in your books, the one which strikes me most is that\r\nlist of species, which you made for me, common to New Zealand and\r\nAmerica, and confined to southern hemisphere; and in this list those\r\ncommon to Chile and New Zealand seem to me the most wondrous. I have\r\ncopied these out and enclosed them. Now I will promise to ask no more\r\nquestions, if you will tell me a little about these. What I want to know\r\nis, whether any or many of them are mountain plants of Chile, so as\r\nto bring them in some degree (like the Chonos plants) under the same\r\ncategory with the Fuegian plants? I see that all the genera (Edwardsia\r\neven having Sandwich Island and Indian species) are wide-ranging genera,\r\nexcept Myosurus, which seems extra wonderful. Do any of these genera\r\ncling to seaside? Are the other species of these genera wide rangers? Do\r\nbe a good Christian and not hate me.\r\n\r\nI began last night to re-read your Galapagos paper, and to my taste it\r\nis quite admirable: I see in it some of the points which I thought best\r\nin A. De Candolle! Such is my memory.\r\n\r\nLyell will not express any opinion on continental extensions. (326/3.\r\nSee Letters 47, 48.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 327. TO C. LYELL. Down, July 8th [1856].\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for your two notes, and especially for Maury's map:\r\nalso for books which you are going to lend me.\r\n\r\nI am sorry you cannot give any verdict on continental extensions; and\r\nI infer that you think my argument of not much weight against such\r\nextensions; I know I wish I could believe. (327/1. This paragraph is\r\npublished in the \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 78; it refers to a letter\r\n(June 25th, 1856, \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 74) giving Darwin's\r\narguments against the doctrine of \"Continental Extension.\" See Letters\r\n47, 48.)\r\n\r\nI have been having a look at Maury (which I once before looked at),\r\nand in respect to Madeira & Co. I must say, that the chart seems to me\r\nagainst land-extension explaining the introduction of organic beings.\r\nMadeira, the Canaries and Azores are so tied together, that I should\r\nhave thought they ought to have been connected by some bank, if changes\r\nof level had been connected with their organic relation. The Azores\r\nought, too, to have shown more connection with America. I had sometimes\r\nspeculated whether icebergs could account for the greater number\r\nof European plants and their more northern character on the Azores,\r\ncompared with Madeira; but it seems dangerous until boulders are found\r\nthere. (327/2. See \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 112, for a letter\r\n(April 26th, 1858) in which Darwin exults over the discovery of\r\nboulders on the Azores and the fulfilment of the prophecy, which he was\r\ncharacteristically half inclined to ascribe to Lyell.)\r\n\r\nOne of the more curious points in Maury is, as it strikes me, in the\r\nlittle change which about 9,000 feet of sudden elevation would make\r\nin the continent visible, and what a prodigious change 9,000 feet\r\nsubsidence would make! Is the difference due to denudation during\r\nelevation? Certainly 12,000 feet elevation would make a prodigious\r\nchange. I have just been quoting you in my essay on ice carrying seeds\r\nin the southern hemisphere, but this will not do in all the cases. I\r\nhave had a week of such hard labour in getting up the relations of all\r\nthe Antarctic flora from Hooker's admirable works. Oddly enough, I have\r\njust finished in great detail, giving evidence of coolness in tropical\r\nregions during the Glacial epoch, and the consequent migration of\r\norganisms through the tropics. There are a good many difficulties, but\r\nupon the whole it explains much. This has been a favourite notion with\r\nme, almost since I wrote on erratic boulders of the south. It harmonises\r\nwith the modification of species; and without admitting this awful\r\npostulate, the Glacial epoch in the south and tropics does not work in\r\nwell. About Atlantis, I doubt whether the Canary Islands are as much\r\nmore related to the continent as they ought to be, if formerly connected\r\nby continuous land.\r\n\r\nHooker, with whom I have formerly discussed the notion of the world\r\nor great belts of it having been cooler, though he at first saw great\r\ndifficulties (and difficulties there are great enough), I think is\r\nmuch inclined to adopt the idea. With modification of specific forms it\r\nexplains some wondrous odd facts in distribution.\r\n\r\nBut I shall never stop if I get on this subject, on which I have been at\r\nwork, sometimes in triumph, sometimes in despair, for the last month.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 328. ASA GRAY TO CHARLES DARWIN. Received August 20th, 1856.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a proof of the last page, that you may see what our flora\r\namounts to. The genera of the Cryptogams (Ferns down to Hepaticae) are\r\nillustrated in fourteen crowded plates. So that the volume has become\r\nrather formidable as a class-book, which it is intended for.\r\n\r\nI have revised the last proofs to-day. The publishers will bring it out\r\nsome time in August. Meanwhile, I am going to have a little holiday,\r\nwhich I have earned, little as I can spare the time for it. And my wife\r\nand I start on Friday to visit my mother and friends in West New York,\r\nand on our way back I will look in upon the scientific meeting at Albany\r\non the 20th inst., or later, just to meet some old friends there.\r\n\r\nWhy could not you come over, on the urgent invitation given to European\r\nsavans--and free passage provided back and forth in the steamers? Yet\r\nI believe nobody is coming. Will you not come next year, if a special\r\ninvitation is sent you on the same terms?\r\n\r\nBoott lately sent me your photograph, which (though not a very perfect\r\none) I am well pleased to have...\r\n\r\nBut there is another question in your last letter--one about which a\r\nperson can only give an impression--and my impression is that, speaking\r\nof plants of a well-known flora, what we call intermediate varieties are\r\ngenerally less numerous in individuals than the two states which they\r\nconnect. That this would be the case in a flora where things are put as\r\nthey naturally should be, I do not much doubt; and the wider are\r\nyour views about species (say, for instance, with Dr. Hooker's very\r\nlatitudinarian notions) the more plainly would this appear. But\r\npractically two things stand hugely in the way of any application of the\r\nfact or principle, if such it be. 1. Our choice of what to take as the\r\ntypical forms very often is not free. We take, e.g., for one of them the\r\nparticular form of which Linnaeus, say, happened to have a specimen sent\r\nhim, and on which [he] established the species; and I know more than one\r\ncase in which that is a rare form of a common species; the other variety\r\nwill perhaps be the opposite extreme--whether the most common or not, or\r\nwill be what L. or [illegible] described as a 2nd species. Here various\r\nintermediate forms may be the most abundant. 2. It is just the same\r\nthing now, in respect to specimens coming in from our new western\r\ncountry. The form which first comes, and is described and named,\r\ndetermines the specific character, and this long sticks as the type,\r\nthough in fact it may be far from the most common form. Yet of plants\r\nvery well known in all their aspects, I can think of several of which\r\nwe recognise two leading forms, and rarely see anything really\r\nintermediate, such as our Mentha borealis, its hairy and its smooth\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nYour former query about the variability of naturalised plants as\r\ncompared with others of same genera, I had not forgotten, but have\r\ntaken no steps to answer. I was going hereafter to take up our list of\r\nnaturalised plants and consider them--it did not fall into my plan to\r\ndo it yet. Off-hand I can only say that it does not strike me that our\r\nintroduced plants generally are more variable, nor as variable, perhaps,\r\nas the indigenous. But this is a mere guess. When you get my sheets of\r\nfirst part of article in \"Silliman's Journal,\" remember that I shall\r\nbe most glad of free critical comments; and the earlier I get them the\r\ngreater use they will be to me...\r\n\r\nOne more favour. Do not, I pray you, speak of your letters troubling me.\r\nI should be sorry indeed to have you stop, or write more rarely, even\r\nthough mortified to find that I can so seldom give you the information\r\nyou might reasonably expect.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 329. TO ASA GRAY. Down, August 24th [1856].\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your letter, which has been very interesting to\r\nme. Your \"indefinite\" answers are perhaps not the least valuable part;\r\nfor Botany has been followed in so much more a philosophical spirit\r\nthan Zoology, that I scarcely ever like to trust any general remark\r\nin Zoology without I find that botanists concur. Thus, with respect to\r\nintermediate varieties being rare, I found it put, as I suspected, much\r\ntoo strongly (without the limitations and doubts which you point out) by\r\na very good naturalist, Mr. Wollaston, in regard to insects; and if it\r\ncould be established as true it would, I think, be a curious point.\r\nYour answer in regard to the introduced plants not being particularly\r\nvariable, agrees with an answer which Mr. H.C. Watson has sent me in\r\nregard to British agrarian plants, or such (whether or no naturalised)\r\n[as] are now found only in cultivated land. It seems to me very odd,\r\nwithout any theoretical notions of any kind, that such plants should not\r\nbe variable; but the evidence seems against it.\r\n\r\nVery sincere thanks for your kind invitation to the United States: in\r\ntruth there is nothing which I should enjoy more; but my health is not,\r\nand will, I suppose, never be strong enough, except for the quietest\r\nroutine life in the country. I shall be particularly glad of the sheets\r\nof your paper on geographical distribution; but it really is unlikely in\r\nthe highest degree that I could make any suggestions.\r\n\r\nWith respect to my remark that I supposed that there were but few\r\nplants common to Europe and the United States, not ranging to the\r\nArctic regions; it was founded on vague grounds, and partly on range of\r\nanimals. But I took H.C. Watson's remarks (1835) and in the table at the\r\nend I found that out of 499 plants believed to be common to the Old and\r\nNew World, only 110 did not range on either side of the Atlantic up to\r\nthe Arctic region. And on writing to Mr. Watson to ask whether he knew\r\nof any plants not ranging northward of Britain (say 55 deg) which were\r\nin common, he writes to me that he imagines there are very few; with Mr.\r\nSyme's assistance he found some 20 to 25 species thus circumstanced,\r\nbut many of them, from one cause or other, he considered doubtful. As\r\nexamples, he specifies to me, with doubt, Chrysosplenium oppositifolium;\r\nIsnardia palustris; Astragalus hypoglottis; Thlaspi alpestre; Arenaria\r\nverna; Lythrum hyssopifolium.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will be inclined to work out for your next paper, what\r\nnumber, of your 321 in common, do not range to Arctic regions. Such\r\nplants seem exposed to such much greater difficulties in diffusion. Very\r\nmany thanks for all your kindness and answers to my questions.\r\n\r\nP.S.--If anything should occur to you on variability of naturalised or\r\nagrarian plants, I hope that you will be so kind as to let me hear, as\r\nit is a point which interests me greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 330. ASA GRAY TO CHARLES DARWIN. Cambridge, Mass., September\r\n23rd, 1856.\r\n\r\nDr. Engelmann, of St. Louis, Missouri, who knew European botany well\r\nbefore he came here, and has been an acute observer generally for twenty\r\nyears or more in this country, in reply to your question I put to him,\r\npromptly said introduced plants are not particularly variable--are not\r\nso variable as the indigenous plants generally, perhaps.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of answering your questions, as to whether there are any\r\nplants social here which are not so in the Old World, is that I know so\r\nlittle about European plants in nature. The following is all I have\r\nto contribute. Lately, I took Engelmann and Agassiz on a botanical\r\nexcursion over half a dozen miles of one of our seaboard counties; when\r\nthey both remarked that they never saw in Europe altogether half so much\r\nbarberry as in that trip. Through all this district B. vulgaris may be\r\nsaid to have become a truly social plant in neglected fields and copses,\r\nand even penetrating into rather close old woods. I always supposed that\r\nbirds diffused the seeds. But I am not clear that many of them touch the\r\nberries. At least, these hang on the bushes over winter in the greatest\r\nabundance. Perhaps the barberry belongs to a warmer country than north\r\nof Europe, and finds itself more at home in our sunny summers. Yet out\r\nof New England it seems not to spread at all.\r\n\r\nMaruta Cotula, fide Engelmann, is a scattered and rather scarce plant in\r\nGermany. Here, from Boston to St. Louis, it covers the roadsides, and is\r\none of our most social plants. But this plant is doubtless a native of a\r\nhotter country than North Germany.\r\n\r\nSt. John's-wort (Hypericum perforatum) is an intrusive weed in all hilly\r\npastures, etc., and may fairly be called a social plant. In Germany it\r\nis not so found, fide Engelmann.\r\n\r\nVerbascum Thapsus is diffused over all the country, is vastly more\r\ncommon here than in Germany, fide Engelmann.\r\n\r\nI suppose Erodium cicutarium was brought to America with cattle from\r\nSpain: it seems to be widely spread over South America out of the\r\nTropics. In Atlantic U.S. it is very scarce and local. But it fills\r\nCalifornia and the interior of Oregon quite back to the west slope of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. Fremont mentions it as the first spring food for\r\nhis cattle when he reached the western side of the Rocky Mountains. And\r\nhardly anybody will believe me when I declare it an introduced plant. I\r\ndaresay it is equally abundant in Spain. I doubt if it is more so.\r\n\r\nEngelmann and I have been noting the species truly indigenous here\r\nwhich, becoming ruderal or campestral, are increasing in the number of\r\nindividuals instead of diminishing as the country becomes more settled\r\nand forests removed. The list of our wild plants which have become true\r\nweeds is larger than I had supposed, and these have probably all of them\r\nincreased their geographical range--at least, have multiplied in numbers\r\nin the Northern States since settlements.\r\n\r\nSome time ago I sent a copy of the first part of my little essay on\r\nthe statistics (330/1. \"Statistics of the Flora of the Northern U.S.\"\r\n(\"Silliman's Journal,\" XXII. and XXIII.)) of our Northern States plants\r\nto Trubner & Co., 12, Paternoster Row, to be thence posted to you. It\r\nmay have been delayed or failed, so I post another from here.\r\n\r\nThis is only a beginning. Range of species in latitude must next be\r\ntabulated--disjoined species catalogued (i.e. those occurring in\r\nremote and entirely separated areas--e.g. Phryma, Monotropa uniflora,\r\netc.)--then some of the curious questions you have suggested--the degree\r\nof consanguinity between the related species of our country and other\r\ncountries, and the comparative range of species in large and small\r\ngenera, etc., etc. Now, is it worth while to go on at this length of\r\ndetail? There is no knowing how much space it may cover. Yet, after all,\r\nfacts in all their fullness is what is wanted, and those not gathered\r\nto support (or even to test) any foregone conclusions. It will be prosy,\r\nbut it may be useful.\r\n\r\nThen I have no time properly to revise MSS. and correct oversights. To\r\nmy vexation, in my short list of our alpine species I have left out,\r\nin some unaccountable manner, two of the most characteristic--viz.,\r\nCassiope hypnoides and Loiseleuria procumbens. Please add them on page\r\n28.\r\n\r\nThere is much to be said about our introduced plants. But now, and for\r\nsome time to come, I must be thinking of quite different matters. I mean\r\nto continue this essay in the January number--for which my MSS. must be\r\nready about the 1st of November.\r\n\r\nI have not yet attempted to count them up; but of course I am prepared\r\nto believe that fully three-fourths of our species common to Europe will\r\n[be] found to range northward to the Arctic regions. I merely meant that\r\nI had in mind a number that do not; I think the number will not be\r\nvery small; and I thought you were under the impression that very few\r\nabsolutely did not so extend northwards. The most striking case I know\r\nis that of Convallaria majalis, in the mountains [of] Virginia and North\r\nCarolina, and not northward. I believe I mentioned this to you before.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 331. TO ASA GRAY. Down, October 12th [1856].\r\n\r\nI received yesterday your most kind letter of the 23rd and your\r\n\"Statistics,\" and two days previously another copy. I thank you\r\ncordially for them. Botanists write, of course, for botanists; but, as\r\nfar as the opinion of an \"outsider\" goes, I think your paper admirable.\r\nI have read carefully a good many papers and works on geographical\r\ndistribution, and I know of only one essay (viz. Hooker's \"New Zealand\")\r\nthat makes any approach to the clearness with which your paper makes a\r\nnon-botanist appreciate the character of the flora of a country. It\r\nis wonderfully condensed (what labour it must have required!). You ask\r\nwhether such details are worth giving: in my opinion, there is literally\r\nnot one word too much.\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for the information about \"social\" and \"varying\r\nplants,\" and likewise for giving me some idea about the proportion (i.e.\r\n1/4th) of European plants which you think do not range to the extreme\r\nNorth. This proportion is very much greater than I had anticipated, from\r\nwhat I picked up in conversation, etc.\r\n\r\nTo return to your \"Statistics.\" I daresay you will give how many genera\r\n(and orders) your 260 introduced plants belong to. I see they include\r\n113 genera non-indigenous. As you have probably a list of the introduced\r\nplants, would it be asking too great a favour to send me, per Hooker\r\nor otherwise, just the total number of genera and orders to which the\r\nintroduced plants belong. I am much interested in this, and have found\r\nDe Candolle's remarks on this subject very instructive.\r\n\r\nNothing has surprised me more than the greater generic and specific\r\naffinity with East Asia than with West America. Can you tell me (and I\r\nwill promise to inflict no other question) whether climate explains this\r\ngreater affinity? or is it one of the many utterly inexplicable problems\r\nin botanical geography? Is East Asia nearly as well known as West\r\nAmerica? so that does the state of knowledge allow a pretty fair\r\ncomparison? I presume it would be impossible, but I think it would make\r\nin one point your tables of generic ranges more clear (admirably clear\r\nas they seem to me) if you could show, even roughly, what proportion of\r\nthe genera in common to Europe (i.e. nearly half) are very general or\r\nmundane rangers. As your results now stand, at the first glance the\r\naffinity seems so very strong to Europe, owing, as I presume, to nearly\r\nhalf of the genera including very many genera common to the world or\r\nlarge portions of it. Europe is thus unfairly exalted. Is this not so?\r\nIf we had the number of genera strictly, or nearly strictly European,\r\none could compare better with Asia and Southern America, etc. But I dare\r\nsay this is a Utopian wish, owing to difficulty of saying what genera\r\nto call mundane; nor have I my ideas at all clear on the subject, and I\r\nhave expressed them even less clearly than I have them.\r\n\r\nI am so very glad that you intend to work out the north range of the 321\r\nEuropean species; for it seems to me the by far most important element\r\nin their distribution.\r\n\r\nAnd I am equally glad that you intend to work out range of species in\r\nregard to size of genera--i.e. number of species in genus. I have been\r\nattempting to do this in a very few cases, but it is folly for any one\r\nbut a botanist to attempt it. I must think that De Candolle has\r\nfallen into error in attempting to do this for orders instead of for\r\ngenera--for reasons with which I will not trouble you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 332. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(332/1. The \"verdict\" referred to in the following letter was Sir J.D.\r\nHooker's opinion on Darwin's MS. on geographical distribution. The first\r\nparagraph has been already published in \"Life and Letters,\" II., page\r\n86.)\r\n\r\nDown, November 4th [1856].\r\n\r\nI thank you more cordially than you will think probable for your note.\r\nYour verdict has been a great relief. On my honour I had no idea whether\r\nor not you would say it was (and I knew you would say it very kindly)\r\nso bad, that you would have begged me to have burnt the whole. To my own\r\nmind my MS. relieved me of some few difficulties, and the difficulties\r\nseemed to me pretty fairly stated; but I had become so bewildered with\r\nconflicting facts--evidence, reasoning and opinions--that I felt\r\nto myself that I had lost all judgment. Your general verdict is\r\nincomparably more favourable than I had anticipated.\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for your invitation. I had made up my mind, on my poor\r\nwife's account, not to come up to next Phil. Club; but I am so much\r\ntempted by your invitation, and my poor dear wife is so good-natured\r\nabout it, that I think I shall not resist--i.e., if she does not get\r\nworse. I would come to dinner at about same time as before, if that\r\nwould suit you, and I do not hear to the contrary; and would go away by\r\nthe early train--i.e., about 9 o'clock. I find my present work tries me\r\na good deal, and sets my heart palpitating, so I must be careful. But\r\nI should so much like to see Henslow, and likewise meet Lindley if\r\nthe fates will permit. You will see whether there will be time for any\r\ncriticism in detail on my MS. before dinner: not that I am in the\r\nleast hurry, for it will be months before I come again to Geographical\r\nDistribution; only I am afraid of your forgetting any remarks.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether my very trifling observations on means of\r\ndistribution are worth your reading, but it amuses me to tell them.\r\n\r\nThe seeds which the eagle had in [its] stomach for eighteen hours looked\r\nso fresh that I would have bet five to one that they would all have\r\ngrown; but some kinds were ALL killed, and two oats, one canary-seed,\r\none clover, and one beet alone came up! Now I should have not cared\r\nswearing that the beet would not have been killed, and I should have\r\nfully expected that the clover would have been. These seeds, however,\r\nwere kept for three days in moist pellets, damp with gastric juice,\r\nafter being ejected, which would have helped to have injured them.\r\n\r\nLately I have been looking, during a few walks, at excrement of small\r\nbirds. I have found six kinds of seeds, which is more than I expected.\r\nLastly, I have had a partridge with twenty-two grains of dry earth on\r\none foot, and to my surprise a pebble as big as a tare seed; and I now\r\nunderstand how this is possible, for the bird scratches itself, [and\r\nthe] little plumous feathers make a sort of very tenacious plaister.\r\nThink of the millions of migratory quails (332/2. See \"Origin,\" Edition\r\nI., page 363, where the millions of migrating quails occur again.), and\r\nit would be strange if some plants have not been transported across good\r\narms of the sea.\r\n\r\nTalking of this, I have just read your curious Raoul Island paper.\r\n(332/3. \"Linn. Soc. Journal.\" I., 1857.) This looks more like a case of\r\ncontinuous land, or perhaps of several intervening, now lost, islands\r\nthan any (according to my heterodox notions) I have yet seen. The\r\nconcordance of the vegetation seems so complete with New Zealand, and\r\nwith that land alone.\r\n\r\nI have read Salter's paper and can hardly stomach it. I wonder whether\r\nthe lighters were ever used to carry grain and hay to ships. (332/4.\r\nSalter, \"Linn. Soc. Journal,\" I., 1857, page 140, \"On the Vitality of\r\nSeeds after prolonged Immersion in the Sea.\" It appears that in 1843 the\r\nmud was scraped from the bottom of the channels in Poole Harbour, and\r\ncarried to shore in barges. On this mud a vegetation differing from that\r\nof the surrounding shore sprang up.)\r\n\r\nAdios, my dear Hooker. I thank you most honestly for your\r\nassistance--assistance, by the way, now spread over some dozen years.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Wednesday. I see from my wife's expression that she does not\r\nreally much like my going, and therefore I must give up, of course, this\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nIf you should have anything to discuss about my MS., I see that I could\r\nget to you by about 12, and then could return by the 2.19 o'clock train,\r\nand be home by 5.30 o'clock, and thus I should get two hours' talk. But\r\nit would be a considerable exertion for me, and I would not undertake it\r\nfor mere pleasure's sake, but would very gladly for my book's sake.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 333. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. November 9th, 1856.\r\n\r\nI have finished the reading of your MS., and have been very much\r\ndelighted and instructed. Your case is a most strong one, and gives me\r\na much higher idea of change than I had previously entertained; and\r\nthough, as you know, never very stubborn about unalterability of\r\nspecific type, I never felt so shaky about species before.\r\n\r\nThe first half you will be able to put more clearly when you polish up.\r\nI have in several cases made pencil alterations in details as to words,\r\netc., to enable myself to follow better,--some of it is rather stiff\r\nreading. I have a page or two of notes for discussion, many of which\r\nwere answered, as I got further on with the MS., more or less fully.\r\nYour doctrine of the cooling of the Tropics is a startling one, when\r\ncarried to the length of supporting plants of cold temperate regions;\r\nand I must confess that, much as I should like it, I can hardly stomach\r\nkeeping the tropical genera alive in so very cool a greenhouse [pencil\r\nnote by C.D., \"Not so very cool, but northern ones could range further\r\nsouth if not opposed\"]. Still I must confess that all your arguments pro\r\nmay be much stronger put than you have. I am more reconciled to iceberg\r\ntransport than I was, the more especially as I will give you any length\r\nof time to keep vitality in ice, and more than that, will let you\r\ntransport roots that way also.\r\n\r\n(333/1. The above letter was pinned to the following note by Mr.\r\nDarwin.)\r\n\r\nIn answer to this show from similarity of American, and European and\r\nAlpine-Arctic plants, that they have travelled enormously without any\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nAs sub-arctic, temperate and tropical are all slowly marching toward the\r\nequator, the tropical will be first checked and distressed, similarly\r\n(333/2. Almost illegible.) the temperate will invade...; after the\r\ntemperate can [not] advance or do not wish to advance further the\r\narctics will be checked and will invade. The temperates will have been\r\nfar longer in Tropics than sub-arctics. The sub-arctics will first have\r\nto cross temperate [zone] and then Tropics. They would penetrate among\r\nstrangers, just like the many naturalised plants brought by man, from\r\nsome unknown advantage. But more, for nearly all have chance of doing\r\nso.\r\n\r\n(333/3. The point of view is more clearly given in the following\r\nletters.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 334. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 15th [1856].\r\n\r\nI shall not consider all your notes on my MS. for some weeks, till\r\nI have done with crossing; but I have not been able to stop myself\r\nmeditating on your powerful objection to the mundane cold period (334/1.\r\nSee Letter 49.), viz. that MANY-fold more of the warm-temperate species\r\nought to have crossed the Tropics than of the sub-arctic forms. I really\r\nthink that to those who deny the modification of species this would\r\nabsolutely disprove my theory. But according to the notions which I am\r\ntesting--viz. that species do become changed, and that time is a most\r\nimportant element (which I think I shall be able to show very clearly\r\nin this case)--in such change, I think, the result would be as follows.\r\nSome of the warm-temperate forms would penetrate the Tropics long before\r\nthe sub-arctic, and some might get across the equator long before the\r\nsub-arctic forms could do so (i.e. always supposing that the cold came\r\non slowly), and therefore these must have been exposed to new associates\r\nand new conditions much longer than the sub-arctic. Hence I should\r\ninfer that we ought to have in the warm-temperate S. hemisphere more\r\nrepresentative or modified forms, and fewer identical species than in\r\ncomparing the colder regions of the N. and S. I have expressed this\r\nvery obscurely, but you will understand, I think, what I mean. It is\r\na parallel case (but with a greater difference) to the species of the\r\nmountains of S. Europe compared with the arctic plants, the S. European\r\nalpine species having been isolated for a longer period than on the\r\narctic islands. Whether there are many tolerably close species in the\r\nwarm-temperate lands of the S. and N. I know not; as in La Plata, Cape\r\nof Good Hope, and S. Australia compared to the North, I know not. I\r\npresume it would be very difficult to test this, but perhaps you will\r\nkeep it a little before your mind, for your argument strikes me as\r\nby far the most serious difficulty which has occurred to me. All your\r\ncriticisms and approvals are in simple truth invaluable to me. I fancy I\r\nam right in speaking in this note of the species in common to N. and S.\r\nas being rather sub-arctic than arctic.\r\n\r\nThis letter does not require any answer. I have written it to\r\nease myself, and to get you just to bear your argument, under the\r\nmodification point of view, in mind. I have had this morning a most\r\ncruel stab in the side on my notion of the distribution of mammals in\r\nrelation to soundings.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 335. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. Kew, Sunday [November 1856].\r\n\r\nI write only to say that I entirely appreciate your answer to my\r\nobjection on the score of the comparative rareness of Northern\r\nwarm-temperate forms in the Southern hemisphere. You certainly have\r\nwriggled out of it by getting them more time to change, but as you must\r\nadmit that the distance traversed is not so great as the arctics have to\r\ntravel, and the extremes of modifying cause not so great as the arctics\r\nundergo, the result should be considerably modified thereby. Thus: the\r\nsub-arctics have (1) to travel twice as far, (2) taking twice the time,\r\n(3) undergoing many more disturbing influences.\r\n\r\nAll this you have to meet by giving the North temperate forms simply\r\nmore time. I think this will hardly hold water.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 336. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 18th [1856].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your note received this morning; and now for another\r\n\"wriggle.\" According to my notions, the sub-arctic species would advance\r\nin a body, advancing so as to keep climate nearly the same; and as long\r\nas they did this I do not believe there would be any tendency to change,\r\nbut only when the few got amongst foreign associates. When the tropical\r\nspecies retreated as far as they could to the equator they would halt,\r\nand then the confusion would spread back in the line of march from the\r\nfar north, and the strongest would struggle forward, etc., etc. (But\r\nI am getting quite poetical in my wriggles). In short, I THINK the\r\nwarm-temperates would be exposed very much longer to those causes which\r\nI believe are alone efficient in producing change than the sub-arctic;\r\nbut I must think more over this, and have a good wriggle. I cannot quite\r\nagree with your proposition that because the sub-arctic have to travel\r\ntwice as far they would be more liable to change. Look at the two\r\njourneys which the arctics have had from N. to S. and S. to N., with no\r\nchange, as may be inferred, if my doctrine is correct, from similarity\r\nof arctic species in America and Europe and in the Alps. But I will not\r\nweary you; but I really and truly think your last objection is not so\r\nstrong as it looks at first. You never make an objection without doing\r\nme much good. Hurrah! a seed has just germinated after 21 1/2 hours in\r\nowl's stomach. This, according to ornithologists' calculation, would\r\ncarry it God knows how many miles; but I think an owl really might go in\r\nstorm in this time 400 or 500 miles. Adios.\r\n\r\nOwls and hawks have often been seen in mid-Atlantic.\r\n\r\n(336/1. An interesting letter, dated November 23rd, 1856, occurs in the\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" II., page 86, which forms part of this discussion.\r\nOn page 87 the following passage occurs: \"I shall have to discuss and\r\nthink more about your difficulty of the temperate and sub-arctic forms\r\nin the S. hemisphere than I have yet done. But I am inclined to think\r\nthat I am right (if my general principles are right), that there would\r\nbe little tendency to the formation of a new species during the period\r\nof migration, whether shorter or longer, though considerable variability\r\nmay have supervened.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 337. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 10th [1856].\r\n\r\nIt is a most tiresome drawback to my satisfaction in writing that,\r\nthough I leave out a good deal and try to condense, every chapter\r\nruns to such an inordinate length. My present chapter on the causes of\r\nfertility and sterility and on natural crossing has actually run out\r\nto 100 pages MS., and yet I do not think I have put in anything\r\nsuperfluous...\r\n\r\nI have for the last fifteen months been tormented and haunted by\r\nland-mollusca, which occur on every oceanic island; and I thought that\r\nthe double creationists or continental extensionists had here a complete\r\nvictory. The few eggs which I have tried both sink and are killed. No\r\none doubts that salt water would be eminently destructive to them; and I\r\nwas really in despair, when I thought I would try them when torpid; and\r\nthis day I have taken a lot out of the sea-water, after exactly seven\r\ndays' immersion. (337/1. This method of dispersal is not given in the\r\n\"Origin\"; it seems, therefore, probable that further experiments upset\r\nthe conclusion drawn in 1856. This would account for the satisfaction\r\nexpressed in the following year at the discovery of another method, on\r\nwhich Darwin wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker: \"The distribution of fresh-water\r\nmolluscs has been a horrid incubus to me, but I think I know my way now.\r\nWhen first hatched they are very active, and I have had thirty or forty\r\ncrawl on a dead duck's foot; and they cannot be jerked off, and\r\nwill live fifteen or even twenty-four hours out of water\" (\"Life and\r\nLetters,\" II., page 93). The published account of these experiments is\r\nin the \"Origin,\" Edition I., page 385.) Some sink and some swim; and in\r\nboth cases I have had (as yet) one come to life again, which has quite\r\nastonished and delighted me. I feel as if a thousand-pound weight was\r\ntaken off my back. Adios, my dear, kind friend.\r\n\r\nI must tell you another of my profound experiments! [Frank] said to me:\r\n\"Why should not a bird be killed (by hawk, lightning, apoplexy, hail,\r\netc.) with seed in its crop, and it would swim?\" No sooner said than\r\ndone: a pigeon has floated for thirty days in salt water with seeds in\r\nits crop, and they have grown splendidly; and to my great surprise even\r\ntares (Leguminosae, so generally killed by sea-water), which the bird\r\nhad naturally eaten, have grown well. You will say gulls and dog-fish,\r\netc., would eat up the carcase, and so they would 999 times out of\r\na thousand, but one might escape: I have seen dead land-birds in\r\nsea-drift.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 338. ASA GRAY TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(338/1. In reply to Darwin's letter given in \"Life and Letters,\" II.,\r\npage 88.)\r\n\r\nCambridge, Mass., February 16th, 1857.\r\n\r\nI meant to have replied to your interesting letter of January 1st long\r\nbefore this time, and also that of November 24th, which I doubt if I\r\nhave ever acknowledged. But after getting my school-book, Lessons in\r\nBotany, off my hands--it taking up time far beyond what its size would\r\nseem to warrant--I had to fall hard at work upon a collection of small\r\nsize from Japan--mostly N. Japan, which I am only just done with. As\r\nI expected, the number of species common to N. America is considerably\r\nincreased in this collection, as also the number of closely\r\nrepresentative species in the two, and a pretty considerable number of\r\nEuropean species too. I have packed off my MSS. (though I hardly know\r\nwhat will become of it), or I would refer you to some illustrations. The\r\ngreater part of the identical species (of Japan and N. America) are of\r\nthose extending to or belonging to N.W. coast of America, but there\r\nare several peculiar to Japan and E. U. States: e.g. our Viburnum\r\nlantanoides is one of Thunberg's species. De Candolle's remarkable case\r\nof Phryma, which he so dwells upon, turns out, as Dr. Hooker said\r\nit would, to be only one out of a great many cases of the same sort.\r\n(Hooker brought Monotropa uniflora, you know, from the Himalayas; and\r\nnow, by the way, I have it from almost as far south, i.e., from St. Fee,\r\nNew Granada)...\r\n\r\nWell, I never meant to draw any conclusions at all, and am very sorry\r\nthat the only one I was beguiled into should \"rile\" (338/2. \"One of your\r\nconclusions makes me groan, viz., that the line of connection of the\r\nstrictly alpine plants is through Greenland. I should extremely like\r\nto see your reasons published in detail, for it 'riles' me (this is a\r\nproper expression, is it not?) dreadfully\" (Darwin to Gray, January 1st,\r\n1857, \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 89).) you, as you say it does,--that\r\non page 73 of my second article: for if it troubles you it is not likely\r\nto be sound. Of course I had no idea of laying any great stress upon the\r\nfact (at first view so unexpected to me) that one-third of our alpine\r\nspecies common to Europe do not reach the Arctic circle; but the remark\r\nwhich I put down was an off-hand inference from what you geologists seem\r\nto have settled--viz., that the northern regions must have been a deal\r\ncooler than they are now--the northern limit of vegetation therefore\r\nmuch lower than now--about the epoch when it would seem probable that\r\nthe existing species of our plants were created. At any rate, during\r\nthe Glacial period there could have been no phaenogamous plants on our\r\ncontinent anywhere near the polar regions; and it seems a good rule to\r\nlook in the first place for the cause or reason of what now is, in that\r\nwhich immediately preceded. I don't see that Greenland could help us\r\nmuch, but if there was any interchange of species between N. America and\r\nN. Europe in those times, was not the communication more likely to be in\r\nlower latitudes than over the pole?\r\n\r\nIf, however, you say--as you may have very good reasons for saying--that\r\nthe existing species got their present diffusion before the Glacial\r\nepoch, I should have no answer. I suppose you must needs assume very\r\ngreat antiquity for species of plants in order to account for their\r\npresent dispersion, so long as we cling--as one cannot but do--to the\r\nidea of the single birthplace of species.\r\n\r\nI am curious to see whether, as you suggest, there would be found a\r\nharmony or close similarity between the geographical range in\r\nthis country of the species common to Europe and those strictly\r\nrepresentative or strictly congeneric with European species. If I get\r\na little time I will look up the facts: though, as Dr. Hooker rightly\r\ntells me, I have no business to be running after side game of any sort,\r\nwhile there is so much I have to do--much more than I shall ever do\r\nprobably--to finish undertakings I have long ago begun.\r\n\r\n...As to your P.S. If you have time to send me a longer list of your\r\nprotean genera, I will say if they seem to be protean here. Of those you\r\nmention:--\r\n\r\nSalix, I really know nothing about.\r\n\r\nRubus, the N. American species, with one exception, are very clearly\r\nmarked indeed.\r\n\r\nMentha, we have only one wild species; that has two pretty well-marked\r\nforms, which have been taken for species; one smooth, the other hairy.\r\n\r\nSaxifraga, gives no trouble here.\r\n\r\nMyosotis, only one or two species here, and those very well marked.\r\n\r\nHieracium, few species, but pretty well marked.\r\n\r\nRosa, putting down a set of nominal species, leaves us four; two of them\r\npolymorphous, but easy to distinguish...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 339. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [1857?]\r\n\r\nOne must judge by one's own light, however imperfect, and as I have\r\nfound no other book (339/1. A. De Candolle's \"Geographie Botanique,\"\r\n1855.) so useful to me, I am bound to feel grateful: no doubt it is\r\nin main part owing to the concentrated light of the noble art of\r\ncompilation. (339/2. See Letter 49.) I was aware that he was not the\r\nfirst who had insisted on range of Monocots. (Was not R. Brown [with]\r\nFlinders?) (339/3. M. Flinders' \"Voyage to Terra Australis in 1801-3,\r\nin H.M.S. 'Investigator'\"; with \"Botanical Appendix,\" by Robert Brown,\r\nLondon, 1814.), and I fancy I only used expression \"strongly insisted\r\non,\"--but it is quite unimportant.\r\n\r\nIf you and I had time to waste, I should like to go over his [De\r\nCandolle's] book and point out the several subjects in which I fancy he\r\nis original. His remarks on the relations of naturalised plants will be\r\nvery useful to me; on the ranges of large families seemed to me good,\r\nthough I believe he has made a great blunder in taking families instead\r\nof smaller groups, as I have been delighted to find in A. Gray's last\r\npaper. But it is no use going on.\r\n\r\nI do so wish I could understand clearly why you do not at all believe in\r\naccidental means of dispersion of plants. The strongest argument which\r\nI can remember at this instant is A. de C., that very widely ranging\r\nplants are found as commonly on islands as over continents. It is really\r\nprovoking to me that the immense contrast in proportion of plants in New\r\nZealand and Australia seems to me a strong argument for non-continuous\r\nland; and this does not seem to weigh in the least with you. I wish I\r\ncould put myself in your frame of mind. In Madeira I find in Wollaston's\r\nbooks a parallel case with your New Zealand case--viz., the striking\r\nabsence of whole genera and orders now common in Europe, and (as I have\r\njust been hunting out) common in Europe in Miocene periods. Of course\r\nI can offer no explanation why this or that group is absent; but if the\r\nmeans of introduction have been accidental, then one might expect odd\r\nproportions and absences. When we meet, do try and make me see more\r\nclearly than I do, your reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 340. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 14th [1858].\r\n\r\nI am heartily glad to hear that my Lyellian notes have been of the\r\nslightest use to you. (340/1. The Copley Medal was given to Sir Charles\r\nLyell in 1858. Mr. Darwin supplied Sir J.D. Hooker, who was on the\r\nCouncil of the Royal Society, with notes for the reasons for the award.\r\nSee Letter 69.) I do not think the view is exaggerated...\r\n\r\nYour letter and lists have MOST DEEPLY interested me. First for less\r\nimportant point, about hermaphrodite trees. (340/2. See \"Life and\r\nLetters,\" II., page 89. In the \"Origin,\" Edition I., page 100, the\r\nauthor quotes Dr. Hooker to the effect that \"the rule does not hold in\r\nAustralia,\" i.e., that trees are not more generally unisexual than other\r\nplants. In the 6th edition, page 79, Darwin adds, \"but if most of the\r\nAustralian trees are dichogamous, the same result would follow as if\r\nthey bore flowers with separated sexes.\") It is enough to knock me down,\r\nyet I can hardly think that British N. America and New Zealand should\r\nall have been theoretically right by chance. Have you at Kew any\r\nEucalyptus or Australian Mimosa which sets its seeds? if so, would it\r\nbe very troublesome to observe when pollen is mature, and whether\r\npollen-tubes enter stigma readily immediately that pollen is mature or\r\nsome little time afterwards? though if pollen is not mature for some\r\nlittle time after flower opens, the stigma might be ready first, though\r\naccording to C.C. Sprengel this is a rarer case. I wrote to Muller for\r\nchance of his being able and willing to observe this.\r\n\r\nYour fact of greater number of European plants (N.B.--But do you mean\r\ngreater percentage?) in Australia than in S. America is astounding and\r\nvery unpleasant to me; for from N.W. America (where nearly the\r\nsame flora exists as in Canada?) to T. del Fuego, there is far more\r\ncontinuous high land than from Europe to Tasmania. There must have,\r\nI should think, existed some curious barrier on American High-Road:\r\ndryness of Peru, excessive damp of Panama, or some other confounded\r\ncause, which either prevented immigration or has since destroyed them.\r\nYou say I may ask questions, and so I have on enclosed paper; but it\r\nwill of course be a very different thing whether you will think them\r\nworth labour of answering.\r\n\r\nMay I keep the lists now returned? otherwise I will have them copied.\r\n\r\nYou said that you would give me a few cases of Australian forms\r\nand identical species going north by Malay Archipelago mountains to\r\nPhilippines and Japan; but if these are given in your \"Introduction\"\r\nthis will suffice for me. (340/3. See Hooker's \"Introductory Essay,\"\r\npage l.)\r\n\r\nYour lists seem to me wonderfully interesting.\r\n\r\nAccording to my theoretical notions, I am not satisfied with what you\r\nsay about local plants in S.W. corner of Australia (340/4. Sir Joseph\r\nreplied in an undated letter: \"Thanks for your hint. I shall be very\r\ncautious how I mention any connection between the varied flora and poor\r\nsoil of S.W. Australia...It is not by the way only that the species\r\nare so numerous, but that these and the genera are so confoundedly well\r\nmarked. You have, in short, an incredible number of VERY LOCAL, WELL\r\nMARKED genera and species crowded into that corner of Australia.\" See\r\n\"Introductory Essay to the Flora of Tasmania,\" 1859, page li.), and the\r\nseeds not readily germinating: do be cautious on this; consider lapse\r\nof time. It does not suit my stomach at all. It is like Wollaston's\r\nconfined land-snails in Porto Santo, and confined to same spots since\r\na Tertiary period, being due to their slow crawling powers; and yet we\r\nknow that other shell-snails have stocked a whole country within a very\r\nfew years with the same breeding powers, and same crawling powers,\r\nwhen the conditions have been favourable to the life of the introduced\r\nspecies. Hypothetically I should rather look at the case as owing\r\nto--but as my notions are not very simple or clear, and only\r\nhypothetical, they are not worth inflicting on you.\r\n\r\nI had vowed not to mention my everlasting Abstract (340/5. The \"Origin\r\nof Species\" was abbreviated from the MS. of an unpublished book.) to you\r\nagain, for I am sure I have bothered you far more than enough about\r\nit; but as you allude to its previous publication I may say that I\r\nhave chapters on Instinct and Hybridism to abstract, which may take\r\na fortnight each; and my materials for Palaeontology, Geographical\r\nDistribution and Affinities being less worked up, I daresay each of\r\nthese will take me three weeks, so that I shall not have done at soonest\r\ntill April, and then my Abstract will in bulk make a small volume. I\r\nnever give more than one or two instances, and I pass over briefly\r\nall difficulties, and yet I cannot make my Abstract shorter, to be\r\nsatisfactory, than I am now doing, and yet it will expand to small\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 341. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [November?] 27th [1858].\r\n\r\nWhat you say about the Cape flora's direct relation to Australia is a\r\ngreat trouble to me. Does not Abyssinia highland, (341/1. In a letter\r\nto Darwin, December 21st (?), 1858, Sir J.D. Hooker wrote: \"Highlands of\r\nAbyssinia will not help you to connect the Cape and Australian temperate\r\nfloras: they want all the types common to both, and, worse than that,\r\nIndia notably wants them. Proteaceae, Thymeleae, Haemodoraceae, Acacia,\r\nRutaceae, of closely allied genera (and in some cases species), are\r\njammed up in S.W. Australia, and C.B.S. [Cape of Good Hope]: add to this\r\nthe Epacrideae (which are mere (paragraph symbol) of Ericaceae) and the\r\nabsence or rarity of Rasaceae, etc., etc., and you have an amount [of]\r\nsimilarity in the floras and dissimilarity to that of Abyssinia and\r\nIndia in the same features that does demand an explanation in any\r\ntheoretical history of Southern vegetation.\"), and the mountains on\r\nW. coast in some degree connect the extra-tropical floras of Cape and\r\nAustralia? To my mind the enormous importance of the Glacial period\r\nrises daily stronger and stronger. I am very glad to hear about S.E. and\r\nS.W. Australia: I suspected after my letter was gone that the case must\r\nbe as it is. You know of course that nearly the same rule holds with\r\nbirds and mammals. Several years ago I reviewed in the \"Annals of\r\nNatural History,\" (341/2. \"Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist.\" Volume XIX.,\r\n1847, pages 53-56, an unsigned review of \"A Natural History of the\r\nMammalia,\" by G.R. Waterhouse, Volume I. The passage referred to is\r\nat page 55: \"The fact of South Australia possessing only few peculiar\r\nspecies, it having been apparently colonised from the eastern and\r\nwestern coasts, is very interesting; for we believe that Mr. Robert\r\nBrown has shown that nearly the same remark is applicable to the plants;\r\nand Mr. Gould finds that most of the birds from these opposite shores,\r\nthough closely allied, are distinct. Considering these facts, together\r\nwith the presence in South Australia of upraised modern Tertiary\r\ndeposits and of extinct volcanoes, it seems probable that the eastern\r\nand western shores once formed two islands, separated from each other\r\nby a shallow sea, with their inhabitants generically, though not\r\nspecifically, related, exactly as are those of New Guinea and Northern\r\nAustralia, and that within a geologically recent period a series of\r\nupheavals converted the intermediate sea into those desert plains which\r\nare now known to stretch from the southern coast far northward, and\r\nwhich then became colonised from the regions to the east and west.\" On\r\nthis point see Hooker's \"Introductory Essay to the Flora of Tasmania,\"\r\npage ci, where Jukes' views are discussed. For an interesting account\r\nof the bearings of the submergence of parts of Australia, see\r\nThiselton-Dyer, \"R. Geogr. Soc. Jour.\" XXII., No. 6.) Waterhouse's\r\n\"Mammalia,\" and speculated that these two corners, now separated by gulf\r\nand low land, must have existed as two large islands; but it is odd that\r\nproductions have not become more mingled; but it accords with, I think,\r\na very general rule in the spreading of organic beings. I agree with\r\nwhat you say about Lyell; he learns more by word of mouth than by\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nHenslow has just gone, and has left me in a fit of enthusiastic\r\nadmiration of his character. He is a really noble and good man.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 342. TO G. BENTHAM. Down, December 1st [1858?].\r\n\r\nI thank you for so kindly taking the trouble of writing to me, on\r\nnaturalised plants. I did not know of, or had forgotten, the clover\r\ncase. How I wish I knew what plants the clover took the place of; but\r\nthat would require more accurate knowledge of any one piece of ground\r\nthan I suppose any one has. In the case of trees being so long-lived, I\r\nshould think it would be extremely difficult to distinguish between true\r\nand new spreading of a species, and a rotation of crop. With respect to\r\nyour idea of plants travelling west, I was much struck by a remark of\r\nyours in the penultimate \"Linnean Journal\" on the spreading of plants\r\nfrom America near Behring Straits. Do you not consider so many more\r\nseeds and plants being taken from Europe to America, than in a reverse\r\ndirection, would go some way to account for comparative fewness of\r\nnaturalised American plants here? Though I think one might wildly\r\nspeculate on European weeds having become well fitted for cultivated\r\nland, during thousands of years of culture, whereas cultivated land\r\nwould be a new home for native American weeds, and they would not\r\nconsequently be able to beat their European rivals when put in contest\r\nwith them on cultivated land. Here is a bit of wild theory! (342/1.\r\nSee Asa Gray, \"Scientific Papers,\" 1889, Volume II., page 235, on \"The\r\nPertinacity and Predominance of Weeds,\" where the view here given is\r\nadopted. In a letter to Asa Gray (November 6th, 1862), published in the\r\n\"Life and Letters,\" II., page 390, Darwin wrote: \"Does it not hurt your\r\nYankee pride that we thrash you so confoundedly? I am sure Mrs. Gray\r\nwill stick up for your own weeds. Ask her whether they are not more\r\nhonest downright good sort of weeds.\")\r\n\r\nBut I did not sit down intending to scribble thus; but to beg a favour\r\nof you. I gave Hooker a list of species of Silene, on which Gartner has\r\nexperimentised in crossing: now I want EXTREMELY to be permitted to say\r\nthat such and such are believed by Mr. Bentham to be true species, and\r\nsuch and such to be only varieties. Unfortunately and stupidly, Gartner\r\ndoes not append author's name to the species.\r\n\r\nThank you heartily for what you say about my book; but you will be\r\ngreatly disappointed; it will be grievously too hypothetical. It will\r\nvery likely be of no other service than collocating some facts; though\r\nI myself think I see my way approximately on the origin of species. But,\r\nalas, how frequent, how almost universal it is in an author to persuade\r\nhimself of the truth of his own dogmas. My only hope is that I certainly\r\nsee very many difficulties of gigantic stature.\r\n\r\nIf you can remember any cases of one introduced species beating out or\r\nprevailing over another, I should be most thankful to hear it. I believe\r\nthe common corn-poppy has been seen indigenous in Sicily. I should like\r\nto know whether you suppose that seedlings of this wild plant would\r\nstand a contest with our own poppy; I should almost expect that\r\nour poppies were in some degree acclimatised and accustomed to our\r\ncornfields. If this could be shown to be so in this and other cases, I\r\nthink we could understand why many not-trained American plants would not\r\nsucceed in our agrarian habitats.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 343. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(343/1. Mr. Darwin used the knowledge of the spread of introduced plants\r\nin North America and Australia to throw light on the cosmic migration\r\nof plants. Sir J.D. Hooker apparently objected that it was not fair\r\nto argue from agrarian to other plants; he also took a view differing\r\nslightly from that of Darwin as to climatal and other natural conditions\r\nfavouring introduced plants in Australia.)\r\n\r\nDown, January 28th, 1859.\r\n\r\nThanks about glaciers. It is a pleasure and profit to me to write to\r\nyou, and as in your last you have touched on naturalised plants of\r\nAustralia, I suppose you would not dislike to hear what I can say\r\nin answer. At least I know you would not wish me to defer to your\r\nauthority, as long as not convinced.\r\n\r\nI quite agree to what you say about our agrarian plants being accustomed\r\nto cultivated land, and so no fair test. Buckman has, I think, published\r\nthis notion with respect to North America. With respect to roadside\r\nplants, I cannot feel so sure that these ought to be excluded, as\r\nanimals make roads in many wild countries. (343/2. In the account of\r\nnaturalised plants in Australia in Sir J.D. Hooker's \"Introductory Essay\r\nto the Flora of Tasmania,\" 1859, page cvi, many of the plants are marked\r\n\"Britain--waste places,\" \"Europe--cornfields,\" etc. In the same list\r\nthe species which have also invaded North America--a large number--are\r\ngiven. On the margin of Darwin's copy is scribbled in pencil: \"Very\r\ngood, showing how many of the same species are naturalised in Australia\r\nand United States, with very different climates; opposed to your\r\nconclusion.\" Sir Joseph supposed that one chief cause of the intrusion\r\nof English plants in Australia, and not vice versa, was the great\r\nimportation of European seed to Australia and the scanty return of\r\nAustralian seed.)\r\n\r\nI have now looked and found passage in F. Muller's (343/3. Ferdinand\r\nMuller.) letter to me, in which he says: \"In the WILDERNESSES of\r\nAustralia some European perennials are \"advancing in sure progress,\"\r\n\"not to be arrested,\" etc. He gives as instances (so I suppose there\r\nare other cases) eleven species, viz., 3. Rumex, Poterium sanguisorba,\r\nPotentilla anserina, Medicago sativa, Taraxacum officinale, Marrubium\r\nvulgare, Plantago lanceolata, P. major, Lolium perenne. All these are\r\nseeding freely. Now I remember, years and years ago, your discussing\r\nwith me how curiously easily plants get naturalised on uninhabited\r\nislands, if ships even touch there. I remember we discussed packages\r\nbeing opened with old hay or straw, etc. Now think of hides and wool\r\n(and wool exported largely over Europe), and plants introduced, and\r\nsamples of corn; and I must think that if Australia had been the old\r\ncountry, and Europe had been the Botany Bay, very few, very much\r\nfewer, Australian plants would have run wild in Europe than have now in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nThe case seems to me much stronger between La Plata and Spain.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I will put in my one sentence on this head, illustrating\r\nthe greater migration during Glacial period from north to south than\r\nreversely, very humbly and cautiously. (343/4. \"Origin of Species,\"\r\nEdition I., page 379. Darwin refers to the facts given by Hooker and De\r\nCandolle showing a stronger migratory flow from north to south than in\r\nthe opposite direction. Darwin accounts for this by the northern plants\r\nhaving been long subject to severe competition in their northern homes,\r\nand having acquired a greater \"dominating power\" than the southern\r\nforms. \"Just in the same manner as we see at the present day that very\r\nmany European productions cover the ground in La Plata, and in a lesser\r\ndegree in Australia, and have to a certain extent beaten the natives;\r\nwhereas extremely few southern forms have become naturalised in any part\r\nof Europe, though hides, wool, and other objects likely to carry seeds\r\nhave been largely imported during the last two or three centuries from\r\nLa Plata, and during the last thirty or forty years from Australia.')\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear you are making good progress with your Australian\r\nIntroduction. I am, thank God, more than half through my chapter on\r\ngeographical distribution, and have done the abstract of the Glacial\r\npart...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 344. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 30th, 1859.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your agreeable note. Please keep the geographical MS.\r\ntill you hear from me, for I may have to beg you to send it to Murray;\r\nas through Lyell's intervention I hope he will publish, but he requires\r\nfirst to see MS. (344/1. \"The Origin of Species\"; see a letter to Lyell\r\nin \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 151.)\r\n\r\nI demur to what you say that we change climate of the world to account\r\nfor \"migration of bugs, flies, etc.\" WE do nothing of the sort; for WE\r\nrest on scored rocks, old moraines, arctic shells, and mammifers. I have\r\nno theory whatever about cause of cold, no more than I have for cause of\r\nelevation and subsidence; and I can see no reason why I should not use\r\ncold, or elevation, or subsidence to explain any other phenomena, such\r\nas distribution. I think if I had space and time I could make a pretty\r\ngood case against any great continental changes since the Glacial\r\nepoch, and this has mainly led me to give up the Lyellian doctrine as\r\ninsufficient to explain all mutations of climate.\r\n\r\nI was amused at the British Museum evidence. (344/2. This refers to the\r\nletter to Murchison (Letter 65), published with the evidence of the 1858\r\nenquiry by the Trustees of the British Museum.) I am made to give my\r\nopinion so authoritatively on botanical matters!...\r\n\r\nAs for our belief in the origin of species making any difference in\r\ndescriptive work, I am sure it is incorrect, for I did all my barnacle\r\nwork under this point of view. Only I often groaned that I was not\r\nallowed simply to decide whether a difference was sufficient to deserve\r\na name.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear about Huxley--a wonderful man.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 345. TO J.D. HOOKER. Wells Terrace, Ilkley, Otley, Yorkshire,\r\nThursday [before December 9th, 1859].\r\n\r\nI have read your discussion (345/1. See \"Introductory Essay,\" page\r\nc. Darwin did not receive this work until December 23rd, so that the\r\nreference is to proof-sheets.), as usual, with great interest. The\r\npoints are awfully intricate, almost at present beyond the confines\r\nof knowledge. The view which I should have looked at as perhaps most\r\nprobable (though it hardly differs from yours) is that the whole world\r\nduring the Secondary ages was inhabited by marsupials, araucarias\r\n(Mem.--Fossil wood so common of this nature in South America (345/2.\r\nSee Letter 6, Note.)), Banksia, etc.; and that these were supplanted and\r\nexterminated in the greater area of the north, but were left alive in\r\nthe south. Whence these very ancient forms originally proceeded seems a\r\nhopeless enquiry.\r\n\r\nYour remarks on the passage of the northern forms southward, and of\r\nthe southern forms of no kinds passing northward, seem to me grand.\r\nAdmirable, also, are your remarks on the struggle of vegetation: I find\r\nthat I have rather misunderstood you, for I feared I differed from you,\r\nwhich I see is hardly the case at all. I cannot help suspecting that you\r\nput rather too much weight to climate in the case of Australia. La\r\nPlata seems to present such analogous facts, though I suppose the\r\nnaturalisation of European plants has there taken place on a still\r\nlarger scale than in Australia...\r\n\r\nYou will get four copies of my book--one for self, and three for the\r\nforeign botanists--in about ten days, or sooner; i.e., as soon as the\r\nsheets can be bound in cloth. I hope this will not be too late for your\r\nparcels.\r\n\r\nWhen you read my volume, use your pencil and score, so that some time I\r\nmay have a talk with you on any criticisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 346. TO HUGH FALCONER. Down, December 17th, [1859].\r\n\r\nWhilst I think of it, let me tell you that years ago I remember seeing\r\nin the Museum of the Geological Society a tooth of hippopotamus from\r\nMadagascar: this, on geographical and all other grounds, ought to be\r\nlooked to. Pray make a note of this fact. (346/1. At a meeting of the\r\nGeological Society, May 1st, 1833, a letter was read from Mr. Telfair\r\nto Sir Alex. Johnstone, accompanying a specimen of recent conglomerate\r\nrock, from the island of Madagascar, containing fragments of a tusk, and\r\npart of a molar tooth of a hippopotamus (\"Proc. Geol. Soc.\" 1833, page\r\n479). There is a reference to these remains of hippopotamus in a paper\r\nby Mr. R.B. Newton in the \"Geol. Mag.\" Volume X., 1893; and in Dr.\r\nForsyth Major's memoir on Megaladapis Madagascariensis (\"Phil. Trans. R.\r\nSoc.\" Volume 185, page 30, 1894).\r\n\r\nSince this letter was written, several bones belonging to two or\r\npossibly three species of hippopotamus have been found in Madagascar.\r\nSee Forsyth Major, \"On the General Results of a Zoological Expedition to\r\nMadagascar in 1894-96\" (\"Proc. Zool. Soc.\" 1896, page 971.))\r\n\r\nWe have returned a week ago from Ilkley, and it has done me some decided\r\ngood. In London I saw Lyell (the poor man who has \"rushed into the\r\nbosom of two heresies\"--by the way, I saw his celts, and how intensely\r\ninteresting), and he told me that you were very antagonistic to my views\r\non species. I well knew this would be the case. I must freely confess,\r\nthe difficulties and objections are terrific; but I cannot believe that\r\na false theory would explain, as it seems to me it does explain, so\r\nmany classes of facts. Do you ever see Wollaston? He and you would agree\r\nnicely about my book (346/2. \"Origin of Species,\" 1859.)--ill luck to\r\nboth of you. If you have anything at all pleasant for me to hear, do\r\nwrite; and if all that you can say is very unpleasant, it will do you\r\ngood to expectorate. And it is well known that you are very fond of\r\nwriting letters. Farewell, my good old friend and enemy.\r\n\r\nDo make a note about the hippopotamus. If you are such a gentleman as to\r\nwrite, pray tell me how Torquay agrees with your health.\r\n\r\n\r\n(PLATE: DR. ASA GRAY, 1867.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 347. TO ASA GRAY. Down, December 24th [1859].\r\n\r\nI have been for ten weeks at Water-cure, and on my return a fortnight\r\nago through London I found a copy of your Memoir, and heartily do I\r\nthank you for it. (347/1. \"Diagnostic Characters of New Species\r\nof Phaenogamous Plants collected in Japan by Charles Wright...with\r\nObservations upon the Relations of the Japanese Flora to that of North\r\nAmerica and of other parts of the Northern Temperate Zone\" (\"Mem.\r\nAmerican Acad. Arts and Sci.\" Volume VI., page 377, 1857).) I have not\r\nread it, and shall not be able very soon, for I am much overworked, and\r\nmy stomach has got nearly as bad as ever.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the discussion on climate, I beg you to believe that I\r\nnever put myself for a moment in competition with Dana; but when one\r\nhas thought on a subject, one cannot avoid forming some opinion. What\r\nI wrote to Hooker I forget, after reading only a few sheets of your\r\nMemoir, which I saw would be full of interest to me. Hooker asked me\r\nto write to you, but, as I told him, I would not presume to express an\r\nopinion to you without careful deliberation. What he wrote I know not:\r\nI had previously several years ago seen (by whom I forget) some\r\nspeculation on warmer period in the U. States subsequent to Glacial\r\nperiod; and I had consulted Lyell, who seemed much to doubt, and Lyell's\r\njudgment is really admirably cautious. The arguments advanced in your\r\npaper and in your letter seem to me hardly sufficient; not that I\r\nshould be at all sorry to admit this subsequent and intercalated warmer\r\nperiod--the more changes the merrier, I think. On the other hand, I\r\ndo not believe that introduction of the Old World forms into New\r\nWorld subsequent to the Glacial period will do for the modified or\r\nrepresentative forms in the two Worlds. There has been too much change\r\nin comparison with the little change of isolated alpine forms; but you\r\nwill see this in my book. (347/2. \"Origin of Species\" (1859), Chapter\r\nXI., pages 365 et seq.) I may just make a few remarks why at first sight\r\nI do not attach much weight to the argument in your letter about the\r\nwarmer climate. Firstly, about the level of the land having been lower\r\nsubsequently to Glacial period, as evidenced by the whole, etc., I\r\ndoubt whether meteorological knowledge is sufficient for this deduction:\r\nturning to the S. hemisphere, it might be argued that a greater extent\r\nof water made the temperature lower; and when much of the northern land\r\nwas lower, it would have been covered by the sea and intermigration\r\nbetween Old and New Worlds would have been checked. Secondly, I doubt\r\nwhether any inference on nature of climate can be deduced from extinct\r\nspecies of mammals. If the musk-ox and deer of great size of your\r\nBarren-Grounds had been known only by fossil bones, who would have\r\nventured to surmise the excessively cold climate they lived under? With\r\nrespect to food of large animals, if you care about the subject will you\r\nturn to my discussion on this subject partly in respect to the Elephas\r\nprimigenius in my \"Journal of Researches\" (Murray's Home and Colonial\r\nLibrary), Chapter V., page 85. (347/3. \"The firm conviction of the\r\nnecessity of a vegetation possessing a character of tropical luxuriance\r\nto support such large animals, and the impossibility of reconciling this\r\nwith the proximity of perpetual congelation, was one chief cause of\r\nthe several theories of sudden revolutions of climate...I am far from\r\nsupposing that the climate has not changed since the period when these\r\nanimals lived, which now lie buried in the ice. At present I only wish\r\nto show that as far as quantity of food alone is concerned, the ancient\r\nrhinoceroses might have roamed over the steppes of Central Siberia\r\neven in their present condition, as well as the living rhinoceroses and\r\nelephants over the karoos of Southern Africa\" (\"Journal of Researches,\"\r\npage 89, 1888).) In this country we infer from remains of Elephas\r\nprimigenius that the climate at the period of its embedment was very\r\nsevere, as seems countenanced by its woolly covering, by the nature\r\nof the deposits with angular fragments, the nature of the co-embedded\r\nshells, and co-existence of the musk-ox. I had formerly gathered from\r\nLyell that the relative position of the Megatherium and Mylodon with\r\nrespect to the Glacial deposits, had not been well made out; but perhaps\r\nit has been so recently. Such are my reasons for not as yet admitting\r\nthe warmer period subsequent to Glacial epoch; but I daresay I may be\r\nquite wrong, and shall not be at all sorry to be proved so.\r\n\r\nI shall assuredly read your essay with care, for I have seen as yet\r\nonly a fragment, and very likely some parts, which I could not formerly\r\nclearly understand, will be clear enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 348. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [December] 26th, [1859].\r\n\r\nI have just read with intense interest as far as page xxvi (348/1. For\r\nDarwin's impression of the \"Introductory Essay to the Tasmanian Flora\"\r\nas a whole, see \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 257.), i.e. to where you\r\ntreat of the Australian Flora itself; and the latter part I remember\r\nthinking most of in the proof-sheets. Either you have altered a good\r\ndeal, or I did not see all or was purblind, for I have been much more\r\ninterested with all the first part than I was before,--not that I did\r\nnot like it at first. All seems to me very clearly written, and I have\r\nbeen baulked at only one sentence. I think, on the whole, I like the\r\ngeological, or rather palaeontological, discussion best: it seems to me\r\nexcellent, and admirably cautious. I agree with all that you say as far\r\nas my want of special knowledge allows me to judge.\r\n\r\nI have no criticisms of any importance, but I should have liked more\r\nfacts in one or two places, which I shall not ask about. I rather demur\r\nto the fairness of your comparison of rising and sinking areas (348/2.\r\nHooker, op. cit., page xv, paragraph 24. Hooker's view was that sinking\r\nislands \"contain comparatively fewer species and fewer peculiar generic\r\ntypes than those which are rising.\" In Darwin's copy of the Essay is\r\nwritten on the margin of page xvi: \"I doubt whole case.\"), as in the\r\nIndian Ocean you compare volcanic land with exclusively coral islands,\r\nand these latter are very small in area and have very peculiar soil,\r\nand during their formation are likely to have been utterly submerged,\r\nperhaps many times, and restocked with existing plants. In the Pacific,\r\nignorance of Marianne and Caroline and other chief islands almost\r\nprevent comparison (348/3. Gambier Island would be an interesting case.\r\n[Note in original.]); and is it right to include American islands like\r\nJuan Fernandez and Galapagos? In such lofty and probably ancient islands\r\nas Sandwich and Tahiti it cannot make much difference in the flora\r\nwhether they have sunk or risen a few thousand feet of late ages.\r\n\r\nI wish you could work in your notion of certain parts of the Tropics\r\nhaving kept hot, whilst other parts were cooled; I tried this scheme in\r\nmy mind, and it seemed to fail. On the whole, I like very much all that\r\nI have read of your Introduction, and I cannot doubt that it will\r\nhave great weight in converting other botanists from the doctrine of\r\nimmutable creation. What a lot of matter there is in one of your pages!\r\n\r\nThere are many points I wish much to discuss with you.\r\n\r\nHow I wish you could work out the Pacific floras: I remember ages\r\nago reading some of your MS. In Paris there must be, I should think,\r\nmaterials from French voyages. But of all places in the world I\r\nshould like to see a good flora of the Sandwich Islands. (348/4. See\r\nHillebrand, \"Flora of the Hawaiian Islands,\" 1888.) I would subscribe\r\n50 pounds to any collector to go there and work at the islands. Would\r\nit not pay for a collector to go there, especially if aided by any\r\nsubscription? It would be a fair occasion to ask for aid from the\r\nGovernment grant of the Royal Society. I think it is the most isolated\r\ngroup in the world, and the islands themselves well isolated from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 349. TO ASA GRAY. Down, January 7th [1860].\r\n\r\nI have just finished your Japan memoir (349/1. \"Diagnostic Characters of\r\nNew Species of Phaenogamous Plants collected in Japan by Charles Wright.\r\nWith observations upon the Relations of the Japanese Flora to that of\r\nNorth America, etc.: 1857-59.\"--\"Memoirs of Amer. Acad.\" VI.), and I\r\nmust thank you for the extreme interest with which I have read it. It\r\nseems to me a most curious case of distribution; and how very well you\r\nargue, and put the case from analogy on the high probability of single\r\ncentres of creation. That great man Agassiz, when he comes to reason,\r\nseems to me as great in taking a wrong view as he is great in observing\r\nand classifying. One of the points which has struck me as most\r\nremarkable and inexplicable in your memoir is the number of monotypic\r\n(or nearly so) genera amongst the representative forms of Japan and\r\nN. America. And how very singular the preponderance of identical and\r\nrepresentative species in Eastern, compared with Western, America. I\r\nhave no good map showing how wide the moderately low country is on the\r\nwest side of the Rocky Mountains; nor, of course, do I know whether\r\nthe whole of the low western territory has been botanised; but it has\r\noccurred to me, looking at such maps as I have, that the eastern area\r\nmust be larger than the western, which would account to a certain small\r\nextent for preponderance on eastern side of the representative species.\r\nIs there any truth in this suspicion? Your memoir sets me marvelling and\r\nreflecting. I confess I am not able quite to understand your Geology at\r\npages 447, 448; but you would probably not care to hear my difficulties,\r\nand therefore I will not trouble you with them.\r\n\r\nI was so grieved to get a letter from Dana at Florence, giving me a very\r\npoor (though improved) account of his health.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 350. TO T.H. HUXLEY. 15, Marine Parade, Eastbourne, November 1st\r\n[1860].\r\n\r\nYour note has been wonderfully interesting. Your term, \"pithecoid man,\"\r\nis a whole paper and theory in itself. How I hope the skull of the new\r\nMacrauchenia has come. It is grand. I return Hooker's letter, with very\r\nmany thanks. The glacial action on Lebanon is particularly interesting,\r\nconsidering its position between Europe and Himalaya. I get more and\r\nmore convinced that my doctrine of mundane Glacial period is correct\r\n(350/1. In the 1st edition of the \"Origin,\" page 373, Darwin argues in\r\nfavour of a Glacial period practically simultaneous over the globe. In\r\nthe 5th edition, 1869, page 451, he adopted Mr. Croll's views on the\r\nalternation of cold periods in the northern and southern hemispheres. An\r\ninteresting modification of the mundane Glacial period theory is given\r\nin Belt's \"The Naturalist in Nicaragua,\" 1874, page 265. Mr. Belt's\r\nviews are discussed in Wallace's \"Geogr. Distribution,\" 1876, Volume I.,\r\npage 151.), and that it is the most important of all late phenomena\r\nwith respect to distribution of plants and animals. I hope your Review\r\n(350/2. The history of the foundation of the \"Natural History Review\"\r\nis given in Huxley's \"Life and Letters,\" Volume I., page 209. See Letter\r\n107.) progresses favourably. I am exhausted and not well, so write\r\nbriefly; for we have had nine days of as much misery as man can endure.\r\nMy poor daughter has suffered pitiably, and night and day required three\r\npersons to support her. The crisis of extreme danger is over, and she\r\nis rallying surprisingly, but the doctors are yet doubtful of ultimate\r\nissue. But the suffering was so pitiable I almost got to wish to see her\r\ndie. She is easy now. When she will be fit to travel home I know not.\r\nI most sincerely hope that Mrs. Huxley keeps up pretty well. The work\r\nwhich most men have to do is a blessing to them in such cases as yours.\r\nGod bless you.\r\n\r\nSir H. Holland came here to see her, and was wonderfully kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 351. TO C. LYELL. Down, November 20th [1860].\r\n\r\nI quite agree in admiration of Forbes' Essay (351/1. \"Memoir of the\r\nGeolog. Survey of the United Kingdom,\" Volume I., 1846.), yet, on my\r\nlife, I think it has done, in some respects, as much mischief as good.\r\nThose who believe in vast continental extensions will never investigate\r\nmeans of distribution. Good heavens, look at Heer's map of Atlantis!\r\nI thought his division and lines of travel of the British plants very\r\nwild, and with hardly any foundation. I quite agree with what you say\r\nof almost certainty of Glacial epoch having destroyed the Spanish\r\nsaxifrages, etc., in Ireland. (351/2. See Letter 20.) I remember well\r\ndiscussing this with Hooker; and I suggested that a slightly different\r\nor more equable and humid climate might have allowed (with perhaps some\r\nextension of land) the plants in question to have grown along the entire\r\nwestern shores between Spain and Ireland, and that subsequently they\r\nbecame extinct, except at the present points under an oceanic climate.\r\nThe point of Devonshire now has a touch of the same character.\r\n\r\nI demur in this particular case to Forbes' transportal by ice. The\r\nsubject has rather gone out of my mind, and it is not worth looking to\r\nmy MS. discussion on migration during the Glacial period; but I remember\r\nthat the distribution of mammalia, and the very regular relation of the\r\nAlpine plants to points due north (alluded to in \"Origin\"), seemed to\r\nindicate continuous land at close of Glacial period.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 352. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 18th [1861].\r\n\r\nI have been recalling my thoughts on the question whether the Glacial\r\nperiod affected the whole world contemporaneously, or only one\r\nlongitudinal belt after another. To my sorrow my old reasons for\r\nrejecting the latter alternative seem to me sufficient, and I should\r\nvery much like to know what you think. Let us suppose that the cold\r\naffected the two Americas either before or after the Old World. Let\r\nit advance first either from north or south till the Tropics became\r\nslightly cooled, and a few temperate forms reached the Silla of Caracas\r\nand the mountains of Brazil. You would say, I suppose, that nearly all\r\nthe tropical productions would be killed; and that subsequently, after\r\nthe cold had moderated, tropical plants immigrated from the other\r\nnon-chilled parts of the world. But this is impossible unless you bridge\r\nover the tropical parts of the Atlantic--a doctrine which you know I\r\ncannot admit, though in some respects wishing I could. Oswald Heer would\r\nmake nothing of such a bridge. When the Glacial period affected the\r\nOld World, would it not be rather rash to suppose that the meridian\r\nof India, the Malay Archipelago, and Australia were refrigerated, and\r\nAfrica not refrigerated? But let us grant that this was so; let us\r\nbridge over the Red Sea (though rather opposed to the former almost\r\ncertain communication between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean); let\r\nus grant that Arabia and Persia were damp and fit for the passage of\r\ntropical plants: nevertheless, just look at the globe and fancy the cold\r\nslowly coming on, and the plants under the tropics travelling towards\r\nthe equator, and it seems to me highly improbable that they could escape\r\nfrom India to the still hot regions of Africa, for they would have to go\r\nwestward with a little northing round the northern shores of the Indian\r\nOcean. So if Africa were refrigerated first, there would be considerable\r\ndifficulty in the tropical productions of Africa escaping into the\r\nstill hot regions of India. Here again you would have to bridge over the\r\nIndian Ocean within so very recent a period, and not in the line of\r\nthe Laccadive Archipelago. If you suppose the cold to travel from the\r\nsouthern pole northwards, it will not help us, unless we suppose that\r\nthe countries immediately north of the northern tropic were at the same\r\ntime warmer, so as to allow free passage from India to Africa, which\r\nseems to me too complex and unsupported an hypothesis to admit.\r\nTherefore I cannot see that the supposition of different longitudinal\r\nbelts of the world being cooled at different periods helps us much.\r\nThe supposition of the whole world being cooled contemporaneously (but\r\nperhaps not quite equally, South America being less cooled than the\r\nOld World) seems to me the simplest hypothesis, and does not add to\r\nthe great difficulty of all the tropical productions not having been\r\nexterminated. I still think that a few species of each still existing\r\ntropical genus must have survived in the hottest or most favourable\r\nspots, either dry or damp. The tropical productions, though much\r\ndistressed by the fall of temperature, would still be under the same\r\nconditions of the length of the day, etc., and would be still exposed\r\nto nearly the same enemies, as insects and other animals; whereas the\r\ninvading temperate productions, though finding a favouring temperature,\r\nwould have some of their conditions of life new, and would be exposed to\r\nmany new enemies. But I fully admit the difficulty to be very great.\r\nI cannot see the full force of your difficulty of no known cause of\r\na mundane change of temperature. We know no cause of continental\r\nelevations and depressions, yet we admit them. Can you believe, looking\r\nto Europe alone, that the intense cold, which must have prevailed when\r\nsuch gigantic glaciers extended on the plains of N. Italy, was due\r\nmerely to changed positions of land within so recent a period? I cannot.\r\nIt would be far too long a story, but it could, I think, be clearly\r\nshown that all our continents existed approximately in their present\r\npositions long before the Glacial period; which seems opposed to such\r\ngigantic geographical changes necessary to cause such a vast fall of\r\ntemperature. The Glacial period endured in Europe and North America\r\nwhilst the level of the land oscillated in height fully 3,000 feet,\r\nand this does not look as if changed level was the cause of the Glacial\r\nperiod. But I have written an unreasonably long discussion. Do not\r\nanswer me at length, but send me a few words some time on the subject.\r\n\r\nI have had this copied, that it might not bore you too much to read it.\r\n\r\nA few words more. When equatorial productions were dreadfully distressed\r\nby fall of temperature, and probably by changed humidity, and changed\r\nproportional numbers of other plants and enemies (though they might\r\nfavour some of the species), I must admit that they all would be\r\nexterminated if productions exactly fitted, not only for the climate,\r\nbut for all the conditions of the equatorial regions during the Glacial\r\nperiod existed and could everywhere have immigrated. But the productions\r\nof the temperate regions would have probably found, under the equator,\r\nin their new homes and soils, considerably different conditions of\r\nhumidity and periodicity, and they would have encountered a new set of\r\nenemies (a most important consideration); for there seems good reason\r\nto believe that animals were not able to migrate nearly to the extent to\r\nwhich plants did during the Glacial period. Hence I can persuade\r\nmyself that the temperate productions would not entirely replace and\r\nexterminate the productions of the cooled tropics, but would become\r\npartially mingled with them.\r\n\r\nI am far from satisfied with what I have scribbled. I conclude that\r\nthere must have been a mundane Glacial period, and that the difficulties\r\nare much the same whether we suppose it contemporaneous over the world,\r\nor that longitudinal belts were affected one after the other. For\r\nHeaven's sake forgive me!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 353. TO H.W. BATES. March 26th [1861].\r\n\r\nI have been particularly struck by your remarks on the Glacial period.\r\n(353/1. In his \"Contributions to the Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley,\"\r\n\"Trans. Entom. Soc.\" Volume V., page 335 (read November 24th, 1860),\r\nMr. Bates discusses the migration of species from the equatorial regions\r\nafter the Glacial period. He arrives at a result which, he points\r\nout, \"is highly interesting as bearing upon the question of how far\r\nextinction is likely to have occurred in equatorial regions during\r\nthe time of the Glacial epoch.\"...\"The result is plain, that there\r\nhas always (at least throughout immense geological epochs) been an\r\nequatorial fauna rich in endemic species, and that extinction cannot\r\nhave prevailed to any extent within a period of time so comparatively\r\nmodern as the Glacial epoch in geology.\" This conclusion does not\r\nsupport the view expressed in the \"Origin of Species\" (Edition I.,\r\nchapter XI., page 378) that the refrigeration of the earth extended to\r\nthe equatorial regions. (Bates, loc. cit., pages 352, 353.)) You seem\r\nto me to have put the case with admirable clearness and with crushing\r\nforce. I am quite staggered with the blow, and do not know what to\r\nthink. Of late several facts have turned up leading me to believe more\r\nfirmly that the Glacial period did affect the equatorial regions; but I\r\ncan make no answer to your argument, and am completely in a cleft\r\nstick. By an odd chance I have only a few days ago been discussing\r\nthis subject, in relation to plants, with Dr. Hooker, who believes to a\r\ncertain extent, but strongly urged the little apparent extinction in the\r\nequatorial regions. I stated in a letter some days ago to him that the\r\ntropics of S. America seem to have suffered less than the Old World.\r\nThere are many perplexing points; temperate plants seem to have migrated\r\nfar more than animals. Possibly species may have been formed more\r\nrapidly within tropics than one would have expected. I freely confess\r\nthat you have confounded me; but I cannot yet give up my belief that the\r\nGlacial period did to certain extent affect the tropics.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 354. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, February 25th [1862].\r\n\r\nI have almost finished your Arctic paper, and I must tell you how I\r\nadmire it. (354/1. \"Outlines of the Distribution of Arctic Plants\"\r\n[Read June 21st, 1860], \"Linn. Soc. Trans.\" XXIII., 1862, page 251. The\r\nauthor's remarks on Mr. Darwin's theories of Geographical Distribution\r\nare given at page 255: they are written in a characteristically\r\ngenerous spirit.) The subject, treated as you have treated it, is really\r\nmagnificent. Good Heaven, what labour it must have cost you! And what a\r\ngrand prospect there is for the future. I need not say how much pleased\r\nI am at your notice of my work; for you know that I regard your opinion\r\nmore than that of all others. Such papers are the real engine to compel\r\npeople to reflect on modification of species; any one with an enquiring\r\nmind could hardly fail to wish to consider the whole subject after\r\nreading your paper. By Jove! you will be driven, nolens volens, to a\r\ncooled globe. Think of your own case of Abyssinia and Fernando Po, and\r\nSouth Africa, and of your Lebanon case (354/2. See \"Origin,\" Edition\r\nVI., page 337.); grant that there are highlands to favour migration, but\r\nsurely the lowlands must have been somewhat cooled. What a splendid new\r\nand original evidence and case is that of Greenland: I cannot see how,\r\neven by granting bridges of continuous land, one can understand the\r\nexisting flora. I should think from the state of Scotland and America,\r\nand from isothermals, that during the coldest part of Glacial period,\r\nGreenland must have been quite depopulated. Like a dog to his vomit, I\r\ncannot help going back and leaning to accidental means of transport\r\nby ice and currents. How curious also is the case of Iceland. What a\r\nsplendid paper you have made of the subject. When we meet I must ask you\r\nhow much you attribute richness of flora of Lapland to mere climate; it\r\nseems to me very marvellous that this point should have been a sort of\r\nfocus of radiation; if, however, it is unnaturally rich, i.e. contains\r\nmore species than it ought to do for its latitude, in comparison with\r\nthe other Arctic regions, would it not thus falsely seem a focus of\r\nradiation? But I shall hereafter have to go over and over again your\r\npaper; at present I am quite muddy on the subject. How very odd, on any\r\nview, the relation of Greenland to the mountains of E. N. America; this\r\nlooks as if there had been wholesale extinction in E. N. America. But I\r\nmust not run on. By the way, I find Link in 1820 speculated on relation\r\nof Alpine and Arctic plants being due to former colder climate, which he\r\nattributed to higher mountains cutting off the warm southern winds.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 355. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. Kew, November 2nd, 1862.\r\n\r\nDid I tell you how deeply pleased I was with Gray's notice of my Arctic\r\nessay? (355/1. \"American Journal of Science and Arts,\" XXXIV., and in\r\nGray's \"Scientific Papers,\" Volume I., page 122.) It was awfully good of\r\nhim, for I am sure he must have seen several blunders. He tells me that\r\nDr. Dawson (355/2. A letter (No. 144) by Sir J.D. Hooker, dated November\r\n7th, 1862, on this subject occurs in the Evolutionary section.) is down\r\non me, and I have a very nice lecture on Arctic and Alpine plants from\r\nDr. D., with a critique on the Arctic essay--which he did not see till\r\nafterwards. He has found some mares' nests in my essay, and one very\r\nvenial blunder in the tables--he seems to HATE Darwinism--he accuses me\r\nof overlooking the geological facts, and dwells much on my overlooking\r\nsubsidence of temperate America during Glacial period--and my asserting\r\na subsidence of Arctic America, which never entered into my head. I\r\nwish, however, if it would not make your head ache too much, you would\r\njust look over my first three pages, and tell me if I have outraged\r\nany geological fact or made any oversights. I expounded the whole thing\r\ntwice to Lyell before I printed it, with map and tables, intending to\r\nget (and I thought I had) his imprimatur for all I did and said; but\r\nwhen here three nights ago, I found he was as ignorant of my having\r\nwritten an Arctic essay as could be! And so I suppose he either did not\r\ntake it in, or thought it of little consequence. Hector approved of it\r\nin toto. I need hardly say that I set out on biological grounds, and\r\nhold myself as independent of theories of subsidence as you do of the\r\nopinions of physicists on heat of globe! I have written a long [letter]\r\nto Dawson.\r\n\r\nBy the way, did you see the \"Athenaeum\" notice of L. Bonaparte's Basque\r\nand Finnish language?--is it not possible that the Basques are Finns\r\nleft behind after the Glacial period, like the Arctic plants? I have\r\noften thought this theory would explain the Mexican and Chinese national\r\naffinities. I am plodding away at Welwitschia by night and Genera\r\nPlantarum by day. We had a very jolly dinner at the Club on Thursday. We\r\nare all well.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 356. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 4th [1862].\r\n\r\nI have read the pages (356/1. The paper on Arctic plants in Volume\r\nXXIII. of the Linnean Society's \"Transactions,\" 1860-62.) attentively\r\n(with even very much more admiration than the first time) and cannot\r\nimagine what makes Dr. D. accuse you of asserting a subsidence of Arctic\r\nAmerica. (356/2. The late Sir J.W. Dawson wrote a review (signed J.W.D)\r\nof Hooker's Arctic paper which appeared in the \"Canadian Naturalist,\"\r\n1862, Volume VII., page 334. The chief part of the article is made up of\r\nquotations from Asa Gray's article referred to below. The remainder is\r\na summary of geological arguments against Hooker's views. We do not\r\nfind the accusation referred to above, which seems to have appeared in\r\na lecture.) No doubt there was a subsidence of N. America during\r\nthe Glacial period, and over a large part, but to maintain that the\r\nsubsidence extended over nearly the whole breadth of the continent, or\r\nlasted during the whole Glacial period, I do not believe he can support.\r\nI suspect much of the evidence of subsidence during the Glacial period\r\nthere will prove false, as it largely rests on ice-action, which is\r\nbecoming, as you know, to be viewed as more and more subaerial. If\r\nDawson has published criticisms I should like to see them. I have heard\r\nhe is rabid against me, and no doubt partly in consequence, against\r\nanything you write in my favour (and never was anything published more\r\nfavourable than the Arctic paper). Lyell had difficulty in preventing\r\nDawson reviewing the \"Origin\" (356/3. Dawson reviewed the \"Origin\" in\r\nthe \"Canadian Naturalist,\" 1860.) on hearsay, without having looked at\r\nit. No spirit of fairness can be expected from so biassed a judge.\r\n\r\nAll I can say is that your few first pages have impressed me far more\r\nthis reading than the first time. Can the Scandinavian portion of the\r\nflora be so potent (356/4. Dr. Hooker wrote: \"Regarded as a whole the\r\nArctic flora is decidedly Scandinavian; for Arctic Scandinavia, or\r\nLapland, though a very small tract of land, contains by far the richest\r\nArctic flora, amounting to three-fourths of the whole\"; he pointed out\r\n\"that the Scandinavian flora is present in every latitude of the globe,\r\nand is the only one that is so\" (quoted by Gray, loc. cit. infra).) from\r\nhaving been preserved in that corner, warmed by the Gulf Stream, and\r\nfrom now alone representing the entire circumpolar flora, during the\r\nwarmer pre-Glacial period? From the first I have not been able to resist\r\nthe impression (shared by Asa Gray, whose Review (356/5. Asa Gray's\r\n\"Scientific Papers,\" Volume I., page 122.) on you pleased me much) that\r\nduring the Glacial period there must have been almost entire extinction\r\nin Greenland; for depth of sea does not favour former southerly\r\nextension of land there. (356/6. In the driving southward of the\r\nvegetation by the Glacial epoch the Greenland flora would be \"driven\r\ninto the sea, that is, exterminated.\" (Hooker quoted by Gray, loc. cit.\r\npage 124.) I must suspect that plants have been largely introduced by\r\nsea currents, which bring so much wood from N. Europe. But here we shall\r\nsplit as wide as the poles asunder. All the world could not persuade me,\r\nif it tried, that yours is not a grand essay. I do not quite understand\r\nwhether it is this essay that Dawson has been \"down on.\" What a curious\r\nnotion about Glacial climate, and Basques and Finns! Are the Basques\r\nmountaineers--I hope so. I am sorry I have not seen the \"Athenaeum,\" but\r\nI now take in the \"Parthenon.\" By the way, I have just read with much\r\ninterest Max Muller (356/7. Probably his \"Lectures on the Science of\r\nLanguage,\" 1861-64.); the last part, about first origin of language,\r\nseems the least satisfactory part.\r\n\r\nPray thank Oliver heartily for his heap of references on poisons.\r\n(356/8. Doubtless in connection with Darwin's work on Drosera: he was\r\nworking at this subject during his stay at Bournemouth in the autumn of\r\n1862.) How the devil does he find them out?\r\n\r\nI must not indulge [myself] with Cypripedium. Asa Gray has made out\r\npretty clearly that, at least in some cases, the act of fertilisation is\r\neffected by small insects being forced to crawl in and out of the flower\r\nin a particular direction; and perhaps I am quite wrong that it is ever\r\neffected by the proboscis.\r\n\r\nI retract so far that if you have the rare C. hirsutissimum, I should\r\nvery much like to examine a cut single flower; for I saw one at a flower\r\nshow, and as far as I could see, it seemed widely different from other\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Answer this, if by chance you can. I remember distinctly having\r\nread in some book of travels, I am nearly sure in Australia, an account\r\nof the natives, during famines, trying and cooking in all sorts of ways\r\nvarious vegetable productions, and sometimes being injured by them. Can\r\nyou remember any such account? I want to find it. I thought it was in\r\nSir G. Grey, but it is not. Could it have been in Eyre's book?\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 357. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. [November 1862].\r\n\r\n...I have speculated on the probability of there having been a\r\npost-Glacial Arctic-Norwego-Greenland in connection, which would account\r\nfor the strong fact, that temperate Greenland is as Arctic as Arctic\r\nGreenland is--a fact, to me, of astounding force. I do confess, that a\r\nnorthern migration would thus fill Greenland as it is filled, in so far\r\nas the whole flora (temperate and Arctic) would be Arctic,--but then the\r\nsame plants should have gone to the other Polar islands, and above all,\r\nso many Scandinavian Arctic plants should not be absent in Greenland,\r\nstill less should whole Natural Orders be absent, and above all the\r\nArctic Leguminosae. It is difficult (as I have told Dawson) to conceive\r\nof the force with which arguments drawn from the absence of certain\r\nfamiliar ubiquitous plants strike the botanists. I would not throw over\r\naltogether ice-transport and water-transport, but I cannot realise\r\ntheir giving rise to such anomalies, in the distribution, as Greenland\r\npresents. So, too, I have always felt the force of your objection, that\r\nGreenland should have been depopulated in the Glacial period, but then\r\nreflected that vegetation now ascends I forget how high (about 1,000\r\nfeet) in Disco, in 70 deg, and that even in a Glacial ocean there may\r\nalways have been lurking-places for the few hundred plants Greenland\r\nnow possesses. Supposing Greenland were repeopled from Scandinavia over\r\nocean way, why should Carices be the chief things brought? Why should\r\nthere have been no Leguminosae brought, no plants but high Arctic?--why\r\nno Caltha palustris, which gilds the marshes of Norway and paints the\r\nhousetops of Iceland? In short, to my eyes, the trans-oceanic migration\r\nwould no more make such an assemblage than special creations would\r\naccount for representative species--and no \"ingenious wriggling\" ever\r\nsatisfied me that it would. There, then!\r\n\r\nI dined with Henry Christy last night, who was just returned from celt\r\nhunting with Lartet, amongst the Basques,--they are Pyreneans. Lubbock\r\nwas there, and told me that my precious speculation was one of Von\r\nBaer's, and that the Finns are supposed to have made the Kjokken\r\nmoddings. I read Max Muller a year ago--and quite agree, first part\r\nis excellent; last, on origin of language, fatuous and feeble as a\r\nscientific argument.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 358. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 12th [1862].\r\n\r\nI return by this post Dawson's lecture, which seems to me interesting,\r\nbut with nothing new. I think he must be rather conceited, with his \"If\r\nDr. Hooker had known this and that, he would have said so and so.\" It\r\nseems to me absurd in Dawson assuming that North America was under sea\r\nduring the whole Glacial period. Certainly Greenland is a most curious\r\nand difficult problem. But as for the Leguminosae, the case, my dear\r\nfellow, is as plain as a pike-staff, as the seeds are so very quickly\r\nkilled by the sea-water. Seriously, it would be a curious experiment to\r\ntry vitality in salt water of the plants which ought to be in Greenland.\r\nI forget, however, that it would be impossible, I suppose, to get hardly\r\nany except the Caltha, and if ever I stumble on that plant in seed I\r\nwill try it.\r\n\r\nI wish to Heaven some one would examine the rocks near sea-level at the\r\nsouth point of Greenland, and see if they are well scored; that would\r\ntell something. But then subsidence might have brought down higher\r\nrocks to present sea-level. I am much more willing to admit your\r\nNorwego-Greenland connecting land than most other cases, from the nature\r\nof the rocks in Spitzbergen and Bear Island. You have broached and\r\nthrown a lot of light on a splendid problem, which some day will be\r\nsolved. It rejoices me to think that, when a boy, I was shown an erratic\r\nboulder in Shrewsbury, and was told by a clever old gentleman that till\r\nthe world's end no one would ever guess how it came there.\r\n\r\nIt makes me laugh to think of Dr. Dawson's indignation at your sentence\r\nabout \"obliquity of vision.\" (358/1. See Letter 144.) By Jove, he will\r\ntry and pitch into you some day. Good night for the present.\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to the Glacial period. You might have asked\r\nDawson whether ibex, marmot, etc., etc., were carried from mountain to\r\nmountain in Europe on floating ice; and whether musk ox got to England\r\non icebergs? Yet England has subsided, if we trust to the good evidence\r\nof shells alone, more during Glacial period than America is known to\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\nFor Heaven's sake instil a word of caution into Tyndall's ears. I saw\r\nan extract that valleys of Switzerland were wholly due to glaciers. He\r\ncannot have reflected on valleys in tropical countries. The grandest\r\nvalleys I ever saw were in Tahiti. Again, if I understand, he supposes\r\nthat glaciers wear down whole mountain ranges; thus lower their height,\r\ndecrease the temperature, and decrease the glaciers themselves. Does\r\nhe suppose the whole of Scotland thus worn down? Surely he must forget\r\noscillation of level would be more potent one way or another during such\r\nenormous lapses of time. It would be hard to believe any mountain range\r\nhas been so long stationary.\r\n\r\nI suppose Lyell's book will soon be out. (358/2. \"The Antiquity of Man,\"\r\n1863.) I was very glad to see in a newspaper that Murray sold 4,000.\r\nWhat a sale!\r\n\r\nI am now working on cultivated plants, and rather like my work; but I\r\nam horribly afraid I make the rashest remarks on value of differences. I\r\ntrust to a sort of instinct, and, God knows, can seldom give any reason\r\nfor my remarks. Lord, in what a medley the origin of cultivated plants\r\nis. I have been reading on strawberries, and I can find hardly two\r\nbotanists agree what are the wild forms; but I pick out of horticultural\r\nbooks here and there queer cases of variation, inheritance, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWhat a long letter I have scribbled; but you must forgive me, for it is\r\na great pleasure thus talking to you.\r\n\r\nDid you ever hear of \"Condy's Ozonised Water\"? I have been trying\r\nit with, I think, extraordinary advantage--to comfort, at least. A\r\nteaspoon, in water, three or four times a day. If you meet any poor\r\ndyspeptic devil like me, suggest it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 359. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, 26th [March 1863].\r\n\r\nI hope and think you are too severe on Lyell's early chapters. Though\r\nso condensed, and not well arranged, they seemed to me to convey with\r\nuncommon force the antiquity of man, and that was his object. (359/1.\r\n\"The Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man\": London, 1863.) It\r\ndid not occur to me, but I fear there is some truth in your criticism,\r\nthat nothing is to be trusted until he [Lyell] had observed it.\r\n\r\nI am glad to see you stirred up about tropical plants during Glacial\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nRemember that I have many times sworn to you that they coexisted; so,\r\nmy dear fellow, you must make them coexist. I do not think that greater\r\ncoolness in a disturbed condition of things would be required than the\r\nzone of the Himalaya, in which you describe some tropical and temperate\r\nforms commingling (359/2. \"During this [the Glacial period], the coldest\r\npoint, the lowlands under the equator, must have been clothed with a\r\nmingled tropical and temperate vegetation, like that described by Hooker\r\nas growing luxuriantly at the height of from four to five thousand feet\r\non the lower slopes of the Himalaya, but with perhaps a still greater\r\npreponderance of temperate forms\" (\"Origin of Species,\" Edition VI.,\r\npage 338).); and as in the lower part of the Cameroons, and as Seemann\r\ndescribes, in low mountains of Panama. It is, as you say, absurd to\r\nsuppose that such a genus as Dipterocarpus (359/3. Dipterocarpus,\r\na genus of the Dipterocarpaceae, a family of dicotyledonous plants\r\nrestricted to the tropics of the Old World.) could have been developed\r\nsince the Glacial era; but do you feel so sure, as to oppose (359/4.\r\nThe meaning seems to be: \"Do you feel so sure that you can bring in\r\nopposition a large body of considerations to show, etc.\") a large body\r\nof considerations on the other side, that this genus could not have been\r\nslowly accustomed to a cooler climate? I see Lindley says it has\r\nnot been brought to England, and so could not have been tried in the\r\ngreenhouse. Have you materials to show to what little height it ever\r\nascends the mountains of Java or Sumatra? It makes a mighty difference,\r\nthe whole area being cooled; and the area perhaps not being in all\r\nrespects, such as dampness, etc., etc., fitted for such temperate\r\nplants as could get in. But, anyhow, I am ready to swear again that\r\nDipterocarpus and any other genus you like to name did survive during a\r\ncooler period.\r\n\r\nAbout reversion you express just what I mean. I somehow blundered, and\r\nmentally took literally that the child inherited from his grandfather.\r\nThis view of latency collates a lot of facts--secondary sexual\r\ncharacters in each individual; tendency of latent character to appear\r\ntemporarily in youth; effect of crossing in educing talent, character,\r\netc. When one thinks of a latent character being handed down, hidden for\r\na thousand or ten thousand generations, and then suddenly appearing, one\r\nis quite bewildered at the host of characters written in invisible ink\r\non the germ. I have no evidence of the reversion of all characters in a\r\nvariety. I quite agree to what you say about genius. I told Lyell that\r\npassage made me groan.\r\n\r\nWhat a pity about Falconer! (359/5. This refers to Falconer's claim\r\nof priority against Lyell. See \"Life and Letters,\" III., page 14; also\r\nLetters 166 and 168.) How singular and how lamentable!\r\n\r\nRemember orchid pods. I have a passion to grow the seeds (and other\r\nmotives). I have not a fact to go on, but have a notion (no, I have a\r\nfirm conviction!) that they are parasitic in early youth on cryptogams!\r\n(359/6. In an article on British Epiphytal Orchids (\"Gard. Chron.\" 1884,\r\npage 144) Malaxis paludosa is described by F.W. Burbidge as being a true\r\nepiphyte on the stems of Sphagnum. Stahl states that the difficulty of\r\ncultivating orchids largely depends on their dependence on a mycorhizal\r\nfungus,--though he does not apply his view to germination. See\r\nPringsheim's \"Jahrbucher,\" XXXIV., page 581. We are indebted to Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker for the reference to Burbidge's paper.) Here is a fool's\r\nnotion. I have some planted on Sphagnum. Do any tropical lichens or\r\nmosses, or European, withstand heat, or grow on any trees in hothouse at\r\nKew? If so, for love of Heaven, favour my madness, and have some scraped\r\noff and sent me.\r\n\r\nI am like a gambler, and love a wild experiment. It gives me great\r\npleasure to fancy that I see radicles of orchid seed penetrating the\r\nSphagnum. I know I shall not, and therefore shall not be disappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 360. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [September 26th 1863].\r\n\r\n...About New Zealand, at last I am coming round, and admit it must have\r\nbeen connected with some terra firma, but I will die rather than admit\r\nAustralia. How I wish mountains of New Caledonia were well worked!...\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 361. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(361/1. In the earlier part of this letter Mr. Darwin refers to a review\r\non Planchon in the \"Nat. History Review,\" April 1865. There can be\r\nno doubt, therefore, that \"Thomson's article\" must be the review of\r\nJordan's \"Diagnoses d'especes nouvelles ou meconnues,\" etc., in the\r\nsame number, page 226. It deals with \"lumpers\" and \"splitters,\" and a\r\npossible trinomial nomenclature.)\r\n\r\nApril 17th [1865].\r\n\r\nI have been very much struck by Thomson's article; it seems to me quite\r\nremarkable for its judgment, force, and clearness. It has interested me\r\ngreatly. I have sometimes loosely speculated on what nomenclature would\r\ncome to, and concluded that it would be trinomial. What a name a\r\nplant will formally bear with the author's name after genus (as some\r\nrecommend), and after species and subspecies! It really seems one of\r\nthe greatest questions which can be discussed for systematic Natural\r\nHistory. How impartially Thomson adjusts the claims of \"hair-splitters\"\r\nand \"lumpers\"! I sincerely hope he will pretty often write reviews or\r\nessays. It is an old subject of grief to me, formerly in Geology and of\r\nlate in Zoology and Botany, that the very best men (excepting those who\r\nhave to write principles and elements, etc.) read so little, and give\r\nup nearly their whole time to original work. I have often thought that\r\nscience would progress more if there was more reading. How few read any\r\nlong and laborious papers! The only use of publishing such seems to be\r\nas a proof that the author has given time and labour to his work.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 362. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, October 22nd and 28th, 1865.\r\n\r\nAs for the anthropologists being a bete noire to scientific men, I\r\nam not surprised, for I have just skimmed through the last \"Anthrop.\r\nJournal,\" and it shows, especially the long attack on the British\r\nAssociation, a curious spirit of insolence, conceit, dullness, and\r\nvulgarity. I have read with uncommon interest Travers' short paper on\r\nthe Chatham Islands. (362/1. See Travers, H.H., \"Notes on the Chatham\r\nIslands,\" \"Linn. Soc. Journ.\" IX., October 1865. Mr. Travers says he\r\npicked up a seed of Edwardsia, evidently washed ashore. The stranded\r\nlogs indicated a current from New Zealand.) I remember your pitching\r\ninto me with terrible ferocity because I said I thought the seed of\r\nEdwardsia might have been floated from Chili to New Zealand: now what do\r\nyou say, my young man, to the three young trees of the same size on one\r\nspot alone of the island, and with the cast-up pod on the shore? If it\r\nwere not for those unlucky wingless birds I could believe that the group\r\nhad been colonised by accidental means; but, as it is, it appears by\r\nfar to me the best evidence of continental extension ever observed. The\r\ndistance, I see, is 360 miles. I wish I knew whether the sea was deeper\r\nthan between New Zealand and Australia. I fear you will not admit such\r\na small accident as the wingless birds having been transported on\r\nicebergs. Do suggest, if you have a chance, to any one visiting the\r\nIslands again, to look out for erratic boulders there. How curious\r\nhis statement is about the fruit-trees and bees! (362/2. \"Since the\r\nimportation of bees, European fruit-trees and bushes have produced\r\nfreely.\" Travers, \"Linn. Soc. Journal,\" IX., page 144.) I wish I knew\r\nwhether the clover had spread before the bees were introduced...\r\n\r\nI saw in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" the sentence about the \"Origin\"\r\ndying in Germany, but did not know it was by Seemann.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 363. TO C. LYELL. Down, February 7th [1866].\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your note and the extract, which have\r\ninterested me extremely. I cannot disbelieve for a moment Agassiz on\r\nGlacial action after all his experience, as you say, and after that\r\ncapital book with plates which he early published (363/1. \"Etudes sur\r\nles Glaciers\"; Neuchatel, 1840.); as for his inferences and reasoning on\r\nthe valley of the Amazon that is quite another question, nor can he have\r\nseen all the regions to which Mrs. A. alludes. (363/2. A letter from\r\nMrs. Agassiz to Lady Lyell, which had been forwarded to Mr. Darwin. The\r\nsame letter was sent also to Sir Charles Bunbury, who, in writing to\r\nLyell on February 3rd, 1866, criticises some of the statements. He\r\nspeaks of Agassiz's observations on glacial phenomena in Brazil as \"very\r\nastonishing indeed; so astonishing that I have very great difficulty in\r\nbelieving them. They shake my faith in the glacial system altogether; or\r\nperhaps they ought rather to shake the faith in Agassiz...If Brazil\r\nwas ever covered with glaciers, I can see no reason why the whole earth\r\nshould not have been so. Perhaps the whole terrestrial globe was once\r\n'one entire and perfect icicle.'\" (From the privately printed \"Life\" of\r\nSir Charles Bunbury, edited by Lady Bunbury, Volume ii., page 334).) Her\r\nletter is not very clear to me, and I do not understand what she means\r\nby \"to a height of more than three thousand feet.\" There are no erratic\r\nboulders (to which I particularly attended ) in the low country round\r\nRio. It is possible or even probable that this area may have subsided,\r\nfor I could detect no evidence of elevation, or any Tertiary formations\r\nor volcanic action. The Organ Mountains are from six to seven thousand\r\nfeet in height; and I am only a little surprised at their bearing the\r\nmarks of glacial action. For some temperate genera of plants, viz.,\r\nVaccinium, Andromeda, Gaultheria, Hypericum, Drosera, Habenaria, inhabit\r\nthese mountains, and I look at this almost as good evidence of a cold\r\nperiod, as glacial action. That there are not more temperate plants can\r\nbe accounted for by the isolated position of these mountains. There are\r\nno erratic boulders on the Pacific coast north of Chiloe, and but few\r\nglaciers in the Cordillera, but it by no means follows, I think, that\r\nthere may not have been formerly gigantic glaciers on the eastern and\r\nmore humid side.\r\n\r\nIn the third edition of \"Origin,\" page 403 (363/3. \"Origin,\" Edition\r\nVI., page 335, 1882. \"Mr. D. Forbes informs me that he found in various\r\nparts of the Cordillera, from lat. 13 deg W. to 30 deg S., at about the\r\nheight of twelve thousand feet, deeply furrowed rocks...and likewise\r\ngreat masses of detritus, including grooved pebbles. Along this whole\r\nspace of the Cordillera true glaciers do not now exist, even at much\r\nmore considerable height. \"), you will find a brief allusion, on\r\nauthority of Mr. D. Forbes, on the former much lower extension of\r\nglaciers in the equatorial Cordillera. Pray also look at page 407 at\r\nwhat I say on the nature of tropical vegetation (which I could now much\r\nimprove) during the Glacial period. (363/4. \"During this, the coldest\r\nperiod, the lowlands under the Equator must have been clothed with a\r\nmingled tropical and temperate vegetation...\" (\"Origin,\" Edition VI.,\r\n1882, page 338).)\r\n\r\nI feel a strong conviction that soon every one will believe that the\r\nwhole world was cooler during the Glacial period. Remember Hooker's\r\nwonderful case recently discovered of the identity of so many temperate\r\nplants on the summit of Fernando Po, and on the mountains of Abyssinia.\r\n(363/5. \"Dr. Hooker has also lately shown that several of the plants\r\nliving in the upper parts of the lofty island of Fernando Po, and in\r\nthe neighbouring Cameroon Mountains, in the Gulf of Guinea, are closely\r\nrelated to those on the mountains of Abyssinia, and likewise to those of\r\ntemperate Europe\" (loc. cit., page 337).) I look at [it] as certain that\r\nthese plants crossed the whole of Africa from east to west during the\r\nsame period. I wish I had published a long chapter written in full, and\r\nalmost ready for the press, on this subject, which I wrote ten years\r\nago. It was impossible in the \"Origin\" to give a fair abstract.\r\n\r\nMy health is considerably improved, so that I am able to work nearly two\r\nhours a day, and so make some little progress with my everlasting book\r\non domestic varieties. You will have heard of my sister Catherine's easy\r\ndeath last Friday morning. (363/6. Catherine Darwin died in February\r\n1866.) She suffered much, and we all look at her death as a blessing,\r\nfor there was much fear of prolonged and greater suffering. We are\r\nuneasy about Susan, but she has hitherto borne it better than we could\r\nhave hoped. (363/7. Susan Darwin died in October 1866.)\r\n\r\nRemember glacial action of Lebanon when you speak of no glacial action\r\nin S. on Himalaya, and in S.E. Australia.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have been very glad to see Sir C. Bunbury's letter. (363/8. The\r\nletter from Bunbury to Lyell, already quoted on this subject. Bunbury\r\nwrites: \"There is nothing in the least NORTHERN, nothing that is not\r\ncharacteristically Brazilian, in the flora of the Organ Mountains.\") If\r\nthe genera which I name from Gardner (363/9. \"Travels in the Interior\r\nof Brazil,\" by G. Gardner: London, 1846.) are not considered by him as\r\nusually temperate forms, I am, of course, silenced; but Hooker looked\r\nover the MS. chapter some ten years ago and did not score out my remarks\r\non them, and he is generally ready enough to pitch into my ignorance\r\nand snub me, as I often deserve. My wonder was how any, ever so few,\r\ntemperate forms reached the mountains of Brazil; and I supposed they\r\ntravelled by the rather high land and ranges (name forgotten) which\r\nstretch from the Cordillera towards Brazil. Cordillera genera of plants\r\nhave also, somehow, reached the Silla of Caracas. When I think of\r\nthe vegetation of New Zealand and west coast of South America, where\r\nglaciers now descend to or very near to the sea, I feel it rash to\r\nconclude that all tropical forms would be destroyed by a considerably\r\ncooler period under the Equator.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 364. TO C. LYELL. Down, Thursday, February 15th [1866].\r\n\r\nMany thanks for Hooker's letter; it is a real pleasure to me to read his\r\nletters; they are always written with such spirit. I quite agree that\r\nAgassiz could never mistake weathered blocks and glacial action; though\r\nthe mistake has, I know, been made in two or three quarters of the\r\nworld. I have often fought with Hooker about the physicists putting\r\ntheir veto on the world having been cooler; it seems to me as irrational\r\nas if, when geologists first brought forward some evidence of elevation\r\nand subsidence, a former Hooker had declared that this could not\r\npossibly be admitted until geologists could explain what made the earth\r\nrise and fall. It seems that I erred greatly about some of the plants on\r\nthe Organ Mountains. (364/1. \"On the Organ Mountains of Brazil some few\r\ntemperate European, some Antarctic, and some Andean genera were found\r\nby Gardner, which did not exist in the low intervening hot countries\"\r\n(\"Origin,\" Edition VI., page 336).) But I am very glad to hear about\r\nFuchsia, etc. I cannot make out what Hooker does believe; he seems to\r\nadmit the former cooler climate, and almost in the same breath to spurn\r\nthe idea. To retort Hooker's words, \"it is inexplicable to me\" how he\r\ncan compare the transport of seeds from the Andes to the Organ Mountains\r\nwith that from a continent to an island. Not to mention the much greater\r\ndistance, there are no currents of water from one to the other; and\r\nwhat on earth should make a bird fly that distance without resting\r\nmany times? I do not at all suppose that nearly all tropical forms were\r\nexterminated during the cool period; but in somewhat depopulated areas,\r\ninto which there could be no migration, probably many closely allied\r\nspecies will have been formed since this period. Hooker's paper in the\r\n\"Natural History Review\" (364/2. Possibly an unsigned article, entitled\r\n\"New Colonial Floras\" (a review of Grisebach's \"Flora of the\r\nBritish West Indian Islands\" and Thwaites' \"Enumeratio Plantarum\r\nZeylaniae\").--\"Nat. Hist. Review,\" January 1865, page 46. See Letter\r\n184.) is well worth studying; but I cannot remember that he gives good\r\ngrounds for his conviction that certain orders of plants could not\r\nwithstand a rather cooler climate, even if it came on most gradually.\r\nWe have only just learnt under how cool a temperature several tropical\r\norchids can flourish. I clearly saw Hooker's difficulty about the\r\npreservation of tropical forms during the cool period, and tried my best\r\nto retain one spot after another as a hothouse for their preservation;\r\nbut it would not hold good, and it was a mere piece of truckling on my\r\npart when I suggested that longitudinal belts of the world were cooled\r\none after the other. I shall very much like to see Agassiz's letter,\r\nwhenever you receive one. I have written a long letter; but a squabble\r\nwith or about Hooker always does me a world of good, and we have been\r\nat it many a long year. I cannot understand whether he attacks me as a\r\nwriggler or a hammerer, but I am very sure that a deal of wriggling has\r\nto be done.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 365. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, July 30th [1866].\r\n\r\nMany thanks about the lupin. Your letter has interested me extremely,\r\nand reminds me of old times. I suppose, by your writing, you would like\r\nto hear my notions. I cannot admit the Atlantis connecting Madeira and\r\nCanary Islands without the strongest evidence, and all on that side\r\n(365/1. Sir J.D. Hooker lectured on \"Insular Floras\" at the Nottingham\r\nmeeting of the British Association on August 27th, 1866. His lecture is\r\ngiven in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" 1867, page 6. No doubt he was at\r\nthis time preparing his remarks on continental extension, which take the\r\nform of a judicial statement, giving the arguments and difficulties on\r\nboth sides. He sums up against continental extension, which, he says,\r\naccounts for everything and explains nothing; \"whilst the hypothesis\r\nof trans-oceanic migration, though it leaves a multitude of facts\r\nunexplained, offers a rational solution of many of the most puzzling\r\nphenomena.\" In his lecture, Sir Joseph wrote that in ascending the\r\nmountains in Madeira there is but little replacement of lowland species\r\nby those of a higher northern latitude. \"Plants become fewer and fewer\r\nas we ascend, and their places are not taken by boreal ones, or by but\r\nvery few.\"): the depth is so great; there is nothing geologically in\r\nthe islands favouring the belief; there are no endemic mammals or\r\nbatrachians. Did not Bunbury show that some Orders of plants were\r\nsingularly deficient? But I rely chiefly on the large amount of specific\r\ndistinction in the insects and land-shells of P. Santo and Madeira:\r\nsurely Canary and Madeira could not have been connected, if Madeira and\r\nP. Santo had long been distinct. If you admit Atlantis, I think you are\r\nbound to admit or explain the difficulties.\r\n\r\nWith respect to cold temperate plants in Madeira, I, of course, know\r\nnot enough to form an opinion; but, admitting Atlantis, I can see their\r\nrarity is a great difficulty; otherwise, seeing that the latitude\r\nis only a little north of the Persian Gulf, and seeing the long\r\nsea-transport for seeds, the rarity of northern plants does not seem to\r\nme difficult. The immigration may have been from a southerly direction,\r\nand it seems that some few African as well as coldish plants are common\r\nto the mountains to the south.\r\n\r\nBelieving in occasional transport, I cannot feel so much surprise at\r\nthere being a good deal in common to Madeira and Canary, these being\r\nthe nearest points of land to each other. It is quite new and very\r\ninteresting to me what you say about the endemic plants being in so\r\nlarge a proportion rare species. From the greater size of the workshop\r\n(i.e., greater competition and greater number of individuals, etc.)\r\nI should expect that continental forms, as they are occasionally\r\nintroduced, would always tend to beat the insular forms; and, as in\r\nevery area, there will always be many forms more or less rare tending\r\ntowards extinction, I should certainly have expected that in islands\r\na large proportion of the rarer forms would have been insular in their\r\norigin. The longer the time any form has existed in an island into which\r\ncontinental forms are occasionally introduced, by so much the chances\r\nwill be in favour of its being peculiar or abnormal in nature, and at\r\nthe same time scanty in numbers. The duration of its existence will\r\nalso have formerly given it the best chance, when it was not so rare, of\r\nbeing widely distributed to adjoining archipelagoes. Here is a wriggle:\r\nthe older a form is, the better the chance will be of its having become\r\ndeveloped into a tree! An island from being surrounded by the sea will\r\nprevent free immigration and competition, hence a greater number of\r\nancient forms will survive on an island than on the nearest continent\r\nwhence the island was stocked; and I have always looked at Clethra\r\n(365/2. Clethra is an American shrubby genus of Ericaceae, found nowhere\r\nnearer to Madeira than North America. Of this plant and of Persea, Sir\r\nCharles Lyell (\"Principles,\" 1872, Volume II., page 422) says: \"Regarded\r\nas relics of a Miocene flora, they are just such forms as we should\r\nnaturally expect to have come from the adjoining Miocene continent.\" See\r\nalso \"Origin of Species,\" Edition VI., page 83, where a similar view is\r\nquoted from Heer.) and the other extra-European forms as remnants of\r\nthe Tertiary flora which formerly inhabited Europe. This preservation of\r\nancient forms in islands appears to me like the preservation of ganoid\r\nfishes in our present freshwaters. You speak of no northern plants on\r\nmountains south of the Pyrenees: does my memory quite deceive me that\r\nBoissier published a long list from the mountains in Southern Spain? I\r\nhave not seen Wollaston's, \"Catalogue,\" (365/4. Probably the \"Catalogue\r\nof the Coleopterous Insects of the Canaries in the British Museum,\"\r\n1864.) but must buy it, if it gives the facts about rare plants which\r\nyou mention.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have given more than enough of my notions, which I well know\r\nwill be in flat contradiction with all yours.\r\n\r\nWollaston, in his \"Insecta Maderensia\" (365/5. \"Insecta Maderensia,\"\r\nLondon, 1854.), 4to, page 12, and in his \"Variation of Species,\" pages\r\n82-7, gives the case of apterous insects, but I remember I worked out\r\nsome additional details.\r\n\r\nI think he gives in these same works the proportion of European insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 366. TO J.D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n(366/1. Sir Joseph had asked (July 31st, 1866): \"Is there an evidence\r\nthat the south of England and of Ireland were not submerged during the\r\nGlacial epoch, when the W. and N. of England were islands in a glacial\r\nsea? And supposing they were above water, could the present Atlantic\r\nand N.W. of France floras we now find there have been there during the\r\nGlacial epoch?--Yet this is what Forbes demands, page 346. At page 347\r\nhe sees this objection, and wriggles out of his difficulty by putting\r\nthe date of the Channel 'towards the close of the Glacial epoch.' What\r\ndoes Austen make the date of the Channel?--ante or post Glacial?\" The\r\nchanges in level and other questions are dealt with in a paper by R.A.C.\r\nAusten (afterwards Godwin-Austen), \"On the Superficial Accumulations\r\nof the Coasts of the English Channel and the Changes they indicate.\"\r\n\"Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.\" VII., 1851, page 118. Obit. notice by Prof.\r\nBonney in the \"Proc. Geol. Soc.\" XLI., page 37, 1885.)\r\n\r\nDown, August 3rd [1866].\r\n\r\nI will take your letter seriatim. There is good evidence that S.E.\r\nEngland was dry land during the Glacial period. I forget what Austen\r\nsays, but Mammals prove, I think, that England has been united to the\r\nContinent since the Glacial period. I don't see your difficulty about\r\nwhat I say on the breaking of an isthmus: if Panama was broken through\r\nwould not the fauna of the Pacific flow into the W. Indies, or vice\r\nversa, and destroy a multitude of creatures? Of course I'm no judge, but\r\nI thought De Candolle had made out his case about small areas of trees.\r\nYou will find at page 112, 3rd edition \"Origin,\" a too concise allusion\r\nto the Madeira flora being a remnant of the Tertiary European flora.\r\nI shall feel deeply interested by reading your botanical difficulties\r\nagainst occasional immigration. The facts you give about certain plants,\r\nsuch as the heaths, are certainly very curious. (366/2. In Hooker's\r\nlecture he gives St. Dabeoc's Heath and Calluna vulgaris as the most\r\nstriking of the few boreal plants in the Azores. Darwin seems to have\r\nbeen impressed by the boreal character of the Azores, thus taking the\r\nopposite view to that of Sir Joseph. See Letter 370, note.) I thought\r\nthe Azores flora was more boreal, but what can you mean by saying that\r\nthe Azores are nearer to Britain and Newfoundland than to Madeira?--on\r\nthe globe they are nearly twice as far off. (366/3. See Letter 368.)\r\nWith respect to sea currents, I formerly made enquiries at Madeira,\r\nbut cannot now give you the results; but I remember that the facts were\r\ndifferent from what is generally stated: I think that a ship wrecked on\r\nthe Canary Islands was thrown up on the coast of Madeira.\r\n\r\nYou speak as if only land-shells differed in Madeira and Porto Santo:\r\ndoes my memory deceive me that there is a host of representative\r\ninsects?\r\n\r\nWhen you exorcise at Nottingham occasional means of transport, be\r\nhonest, and admit how little is known on the subject. Remember how\r\nrecently you and others thought that salt water would soon kill seeds.\r\nReflect that there is not a coral islet in the ocean which is not pretty\r\nwell clothed with plants, and the fewness of the species can hardly\r\nwith justice be attributed to the arrival of few seeds, for coral islets\r\nclose to other land support only the same limited vegetation. Remember\r\nthat no one knew that seeds would remain for many hours in the crops of\r\nbirds and retain their vitality; that fish eat seeds, and that when the\r\nfish are devoured by birds the seeds can germinate, etc. Remember that\r\nevery year many birds are blown to Madeira and to the Bermudas. Remember\r\nthat dust is blown 1,000 miles over the Atlantic. Now, bearing all this\r\nin mind, would it not be a prodigy if an unstocked island did not in the\r\ncourse of ages receive colonists from coasts whence the currents flow,\r\ntrees are drifted and birds are driven by gales. The objections to\r\nislands being thus stocked are, as far as I understand, that certain\r\nspecies and genera have been more freely introduced, and others less\r\nfreely than might have been expected. But then the sea kills some sorts\r\nof seeds, others are killed by the digestion of birds, and some would\r\nbe more liable than others to adhere to birds' feet. But we know so very\r\nlittle on these points that it seems to me that we cannot at all tell\r\nwhat forms would probably be introduced and what would not. I do not for\r\na moment pretend that these means of introduction can be proved to\r\nhave acted; but they seem to me sufficient, with no valid or heavy\r\nobjections, whilst there are, as it seems to me, the heaviest objections\r\non geological and on geographical distribution grounds (pages 387, 388,\r\n\"Origin\" (366/4. Edition III., or Edition VI., page 323.) to Forbes'\r\nenormous continental extensions. But I fear that I shall and have bored\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 367. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n(367/1. In a letter of July 31st, Sir J.D. Hooker wrote, \"You must not\r\nsuppose me to be a champion of continental connection, because I am not\r\nagreeable to trans-oceanic migration...either hypothesis appears to\r\nme well to cover the facts of oceanic floras, but there are grave\r\nobjections to both, botanical to yours, geological to Forbes'.\")\r\n\r\nThe following interesting letters give some of Sir Joseph's\r\ndifficulties.)\r\n\r\nKew, August 4th, 1866.\r\n\r\nYou mention (\"Journal\") no land-birds, except introduced, upon St.\r\nHelena. Beatson (Introduction xvii) mentions one (367/2. Aegialitis\r\nsanctae-helenae, a small plover \"very closely allied to a species found\r\nin South Africa, but presenting certain differences which entitle it to\r\nthe rank of a peculiar species\" (Wallace, \"Island Life,\" page 294).\r\nIn the earlier editions of the \"Origin\" (e.g. Edition III., page 422)\r\nDarwin wrote that \"Madeira does not possess one peculiar bird.\"\r\nIn Edition IV., 1866, page 465, the mistake was put right.) \"in\r\nconsiderable numbers,\" resembles sand-lark--is called \"wire bird,\" has\r\nlong greenish legs like wires, runs fast, eyes large, bill moderately\r\nlong, is rather shy, does not possess much powers of flight. What was\r\nit? I have written to ask Sclater, also about birds of Madeira and\r\nAzores. It is a very curious thing that the Azores do not contain the\r\n(non-European) American genus Clethra, that is found in Madeira and\r\nCanaries, and that the Azores contain no trace of American element\r\n(beyond what is common to Madeira), except a species of Sanicula, a\r\ngenus with hooked bristles to the small seed-vessels. The European\r\nSanicula roams from Norway to Madeira, Canaries, Cape Verde, Cameroons,\r\nCape of Good Hope, and from Britain to Japan, and also is, I think, in\r\nN. America; but does not occur in the Azores, where it is replaced by\r\none that is of a decidedly American type.\r\n\r\nThis tells heavily against the doctrine that joins Atlantis to America,\r\nand is much against your trans-oceanic migration--for considering how\r\nnear the Azores are to America, and in the influence of the Gulf-stream\r\nand prevalent winds, it certainly appears marvellous. Not only are the\r\nAzores in a current that sweeps the coast of U. States, but they are in\r\nthe S.W. winds, and in the eye of the S.W. hurricanes!\r\n\r\nI suppose you will answer that the European forms are prepotent, but\r\nthis is riding prepotency to death.\r\n\r\nR.T. Lowe has written me a capital letter on the Madeiran, Canarian, and\r\nCape Verde floras.\r\n\r\nI misled you if I gave you to understand that Wollaston's Catalogue said\r\nanything about rare plants. I am worked and worried to death with this\r\nlecture: and curse myself as a soft headed and hearted imbecile to have\r\naccepted it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 368. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. Kew, Monday [August 6th,\r\n1866].\r\n\r\nAgain thanks for your letter. You need not fear my not doing justice to\r\nyour objections to the continental hypothesis!\r\n\r\nReferring to page 344 again (368/1. \"Origin of Species,\" Edition III.,\r\npages 343-4: \"In some cases, however, as by the breaking of an isthmus\r\nand the consequent irruption of a multitude of new inhabitants, or\r\nby the final subsidence of an island, the extinction may have been\r\ncomparatively rapid.\"), it never occurred to me that you alluded to\r\nextinction of marine life: an isthmus is a piece of land, and you go on\r\nin the same sentence about \"an island,\" which quite threw me out, for\r\nthe destruction of an isthmus makes an island!\r\n\r\nI surely did not say Azores nearer to Britain and Newfoundland \"than to\r\nMadeira,\" but \"than Madeira is to said places.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Madeiran coleoptera I rely very little on local\r\ndistribution of insects--they are so local themselves. A butterfly is\r\na great rarity in Kew, even a white, though we are surrounded by market\r\ngardens. All insects are most rare with us, even the kinds that abound\r\non the opposite side of Thames.\r\n\r\nSo with shells, we have literally none--not a Helix even, though they\r\nabound in the lanes 200 yards off the Gardens. Of the 89 Dezertas\r\ninsects [only?] 11 are peculiar. Of the 162 Porto Santan 113 are\r\nMadeiran and 51 Dezertan.\r\n\r\nNever mind bothering Murray about the new edition of the \"Origin\" for\r\nme. You will tell me anything bearing on my subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 369. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. Kew, August 7th, 1866.\r\n\r\nDear old Darwin,\r\n\r\nYou must not let me worry you. I am an obstinate pig, but you must not\r\nbe miserable at my looking at the same thing in a different light from\r\nyou. I must get to the bottom of this question, and that is all I can\r\ndo. Some cleverer fellow one day will knock the bottom out of it, and\r\nsee his way to explain what to a botanist without a theory to support\r\nmust be very great difficulties. True enough, all may be explained, as\r\nyou reason it will be--I quite grant this; but meanwhile all is not so\r\nexplained, and I cannot accept a hypothesis that leaves so many facts\r\nunaccounted for. You say the temperate parts of N. America [are] nearly\r\ntwo and a half times as distant from the Azores as Europe is. According\r\nto a rough calculation on Col. James' chart I make E. Azores to Portugal\r\n850, West do. to Newfoundland 1500, but I am writing to a friend at\r\nAdmiralty to have the distance calculated (which looks like cracking\r\nnuts with Nasmyth's hammer!)\r\n\r\nAre European birds blown to America? Are the Azorean erratics an\r\nestablished fact? I want them very badly, though they are not of much\r\nconsequence, as a slight sinking would hide all evidence of that sort.\r\n\r\nI do want to sum up impartially, leaving the verdict to jury. I cannot\r\ndo this without putting all difficulties most clearly. How do you know\r\nhow you would fare with me if you were a continentalist! Then too we\r\nmust recollect that I have to meet a host who are all on the continental\r\nside--in fact, pretty nearly all the thinkers, Forbes, Hartung, Heer,\r\nUnger, Wollaston, Lowe (Wallace, I suppose), and now Andrew Murray. I do\r\nnot regard all these, and snap my fingers at all but you; in my inmost\r\nsoul I conscientiously say I incline to your theory, but I cannot accept\r\nit as an established truth or unexceptionable hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe \"Wire bird\" being a Grallator is a curious fact favourable to\r\nyou...How I do yearn to go out again to St. Helena.\r\n\r\nOf course I accept the ornithological evidence as tremendously strong,\r\nthough why they should get blown westerly, and not change specifically,\r\nas insects, shells, and plants have done, is a mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 370. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, August 8th [1866].\r\n\r\nIt would be a very great pleasure to me if I could think that my letters\r\nwere of the least use to you. I must have expressed myself badly for you\r\nto suppose that I look at islands being stocked by occasional transport\r\nas a well-established hypothesis. We both give up creation, and\r\ntherefore have to account for the inhabitants of islands either by\r\ncontinental extensions or by occasional transport. Now, all that\r\nI maintain is that of these two alternatives, one of which must be\r\nadmitted, notwithstanding very many difficulties, occasional transport\r\nis by far the most probable. I go thus far further--that I maintain,\r\nknowing what we do, that it would be inexplicable if unstocked islands\r\nwere not stocked to a certain extent at least by these occasional means.\r\nEuropean birds are occasionally driven to America, but far more rarely\r\nthan in the reverse direction: they arrive via Greenland (Baird); yet a\r\nEuropean lark has been caught in Bermuda.\r\n\r\nBy the way, you might like to hear that European birds regularly migrate\r\nvia the northern islands to Greenland.\r\n\r\nAbout the erratics in the Azores see \"Origin,\" page 393. (370/1.\r\n\"Origin,\" Edition VI., page 328. The importance of erratic blocks on the\r\nAzores is in showing the probability of ice-borne seeds having stocked\r\nthe islands, and thus accounting for the number of European species\r\nand their unexpectedly northern character. Darwin's delight in the\r\nverification of his theory is described in a letter to Sir Joseph of\r\nApril 26th, 1858, in the \"Life and Letters,\" II., page 112.) Hartung\r\ncould hardly be mistaken about granite blocks on a volcanic island.\r\n\r\nI do not think it a mystery that birds have not been modified in\r\nMadeira. (370/2. \"Origin,\" Edition VI., page 328. Madeira has only one\r\nendemic bird. Darwin accounts for the fact from the island having been\r\nstocked with birds which had struggled together and become mutually\r\nco-adapted on the neighbouring continents. \"Hence, when settled in their\r\nnew homes, each kind will have been kept by the others in its proper\r\nplace and habits, and will consequently have been but little liable to\r\nmodification.\" Crossing with frequently arriving immigrants will also\r\ntend to keep down modification.) Pray look at page 422 of \"Origin\"\r\n[Edition III.]. You would not think it a mystery if you had seen the\r\nlong lists which I have (somewhere) of the birds annually blown, even in\r\nflocks, to Madeira. The crossed stock would be the more vigorous.\r\n\r\nRemember if you do not come here before Nottingham, if you do not come\r\nafterwards I shall think myself diabolically ill-used.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 371. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. Kew, August 9th, 1866.\r\n\r\nIf my letters did not gene you it is impossible that you should suppose\r\nthat yours were of no use to me! I would throw up the whole thing were\r\nit not for correspondence with you, which is the only bit of silver\r\nin the affair. I do feel it disgusting to have to make a point of a\r\nspeciality in which I cannot see my way a bit further than I could\r\nbefore I began. To be sure, I have a very much clearer notion of the\r\npros and cons on both sides (though these were rather forgotten facts\r\nthan rediscoveries). I see the sides of the well further down more\r\ndistinctly, but the bottom is as obscure as ever.\r\n\r\nI think I know the \"Origin\" by heart in relation to the subject, and\r\nit was reading it that suggested the queries about Azores boulders and\r\nMadeira birds. The former you and I have talked over, and I thought I\r\nremembered that you wanted it confirmed. The latter strikes me thus: why\r\nshould plants and insects have been so extensively changed and birds not\r\nat all? I perfectly understand and feel the force of your argument in\r\nreference to birds per se, but why do these not apply to insects and\r\nplants? Can you not see that this suggests the conclusion that the\r\nplants are derived one way and the birds another?\r\n\r\nI certainly did take it for granted that you supposed the stocking [by]\r\noccasional transport to be something even more than a \"well-established\r\nhypothesis,\" but disputants seldom stop to measure the strength of their\r\nantagonist's opinion.\r\n\r\nI shall be with you on Saturday week, I hope. I should have come before,\r\nbut have made so little progress that I could not. I am now at St.\r\nHelena, and shall then go to, and finish with, Kerguelen's land.\r\n\r\n(371/1. After giving the distances of the Azores, etc., from America,\r\nSir Joseph continues:--)\r\n\r\nBut to my mind [it] does not mend the matter--for I do not ask why\r\nAzores have even proportionally (to distance) a smaller number of\r\nAmerican plants, but why they have none, seeing the winds and currents\r\nset that way. The Bermudas are all American in flora, but from what\r\nCol. Munro informs me I should say they have nothing but common American\r\nweeds and the juniper (cedar). No changed forms, yet they are as far\r\nfrom America as Azores from Europe. I suppose they are modern and out of\r\nthe pale.\r\n\r\n...There is this, to me, astounding difference between certain oceanic\r\nislands which were stocked by continental extension and those stocked\r\nby immigration (following in both definitions your opinion), that\r\nthe former [continental] do contain many types of the more distant\r\ncontinent, the latter do not any! Take Madagascar, with its many\r\nAsiatic genera unknown in Africa; Ceylon, with many Malayan types not\r\nPeninsular; Japan, with many non-Asiatic American types. Baird's fact of\r\nGreenland migration I was aware of since I wrote my Arctic paper. I wish\r\nI was as satisfied either of continental [extensions] or of transport\r\nmeans as I am of my Greenland hypothesis!\r\n\r\nOh, dear me, what a comfort it is to have a belief (sneer away).\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 372. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. Kew, December 4th, 1866.\r\n\r\nI have just finished the New Zealand \"Manual\" (372/1. \"Handbook of\r\nthe New Zealand Flora.\"), and am thinking about a discussion on the\r\ngeographical distribution, etc., of the plants. There is scarcely a\r\nsingle indigenous annual plant in the group. I wish that I knew more of\r\nthe past condition of the islands, and whether they have been rising or\r\nsinking. There is much that suggests the idea that the islands were\r\nonce connected during a warmer epoch, were afterwards separated and\r\nmuch reduced in area to what they now are, and lastly have assumed their\r\npresent size. The remarkable general uniformity of the flora, even of\r\nthe arboreous flora, throughout so many degrees of latitude, is a very\r\nremarkable feature, as is the representation of a good many of the\r\nsouthern half of certain species of the north, by very closely allied\r\nvarieties or species; and, lastly, there is the immense preponderance of\r\ncertain genera whose species all run into one another and vary horribly,\r\nand which suggest a rising area. I hear that a whale has been found some\r\nmiles inland.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 373. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. Kew, December 14th, 1866.\r\n\r\nI do not see how the mountains of New Zealand, S. Australia, and\r\nTasmania could have been peopled, and [with] so large an extent of\r\nantarctic (373/1. \"Introductory Essay to Flora of New Zealand,\" page xx.\r\n\"The plants of the Antarctic islands, which are equally natives of New\r\nZealand, Tasmania, and Australia, are almost invariably found only\r\non the lofty mountains of these countries.\") forms common to Fuegia,\r\nwithout some intercommunication. And I have always supposed this was\r\nbefore the immigration of Asiatic plants into Australia, and of\r\nwhich plants the temperate and tropical plants of that country may be\r\nconsidered as altered forms. The presence of so many of these temperate\r\nand cold Australian and New Zealand genera on the top of Kini Balu in\r\nBorneo (under the equator) is an awful staggerer, and demands a very\r\nextended northern distribution of Australian temperate forms. It is\r\na frightful assumption that the plains of Borneo were covered with a\r\ntemperate cold vegetation that was driven up Kini Balu by the returning\r\ncold. Then there is the very distant distribution of a few Australian\r\ntypes northward to the Philippines, China, and Japan: that is a fearful\r\nand wonderful fact, though, as these plants are New Zealand too for the\r\nmost part, the migration northward may have been east of Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 374. TO J.D. HOOKER. December 24th [1866].\r\n\r\n...One word more about the flora derived from supposed Pleistocene\r\nantarctic land requiring land intercommunication. This will depend much,\r\nas it seems to me, upon how far you finally settle whether Azores, Cape\r\nde Verdes, Tristan d'Acunha, Galapagos, Juan Fernandez, etc., etc.,\r\netc., have all had land intercommunication. If you do not think this\r\nnecessary, might not New Zealand, etc., have been stocked during\r\ncommencing Glacial period by occasional means from antarctic land? As\r\nfor lowlands of Borneo being tenanted by a moderate number of temperate\r\nforms during the Glacial period, so far [is it] from appearing a\r\n\"frightful assumption\" that I am arrived at that pitch of bigotry that I\r\nlook at it as proved!\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 375. J.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. Kew, December 25th, 1866.\r\n\r\nI was about to write to-day, when your jolly letter came this morning,\r\nto tell you that after carefully going over the N.Z. Flora, I find that\r\nthere are only about thirty reputed indigenous Dicot. annuals, of\r\nwhich almost half, not being found by Banks and Solander, are probably\r\nnon-indigenous. This is just 1/20th of the Dicots., or, excluding the\r\ndoubtful, about 1/40th, whereas the British proportion of annuals is\r\n1/4.6 amongst Dicots.!!! Of the naturalised New Zealand plants one-half\r\nare annual! I suppose there can be no doubt but that a deciduous-leaved\r\nvegetation affords more conditions for vegetable life than an evergreen\r\none, and that it is hence that we find countries characterised by\r\nuniform climates to be poor in species, and those to be evergreens. I\r\ncan now work this point out for New Zealand and Britain. Japan may be\r\nan exception: it is an extraordinary evergreen country, and has many\r\nspecies apparently, but it has so much novelty that it may not be so\r\nrich in species really as it hence looks, and I do believe it is very\r\npoor. It has very few annuals. Then, again, I think that the number of\r\nplants with irregular flowers, and especially such as require insect\r\nagency, diminishes much with evergreenity. Hence in all humid temperate\r\nregions we have, as a rule, few species, many evergreens, few annuals,\r\nfew Leguminosae and orchids, few lepidoptera and other flying\r\ninsects, many Coniferae, Amentaceae, Gramineae, Cyperaceae, and other\r\nwind-fertilised trees and plants, etc. Orchids and Leguminosae are\r\nscarce in islets, because the necessary fertilising insects have not\r\nmigrated with the plants. Perhaps you have published this.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 376. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 9th [1867].\r\n\r\nI like the first part of your paper in the \"Gard. Chronicle\" (376/1.\r\nThe lecture on Insular Floras (\"Gard. Chron.\" January 1867).) to an\r\nextraordinary degree: you never, in my opinion, wrote anything better.\r\nYou ask for all, even minute criticisms. In the first column you speak\r\nof no alpine plants and no replacement by zones, which will strike\r\nevery one with astonishment who has read Humboldt and Webb on Zones on\r\nTeneriffe. Do you not mean boreal or arctic plants? (376/2. The passage\r\nwhich seems to be referred to does mention the absence of BOREAL\r\nplants.) In the third column you speak as if savages (376/3. \"Such\r\nplants on oceanic islands are, like the savages which in some islands\r\nhave been so long the sole witnesses of their existence, the last\r\nrepresentatives of their several races.\") had generally viewed the\r\nendemic plants of the Atlantic islands. Now, as you well know, the\r\nCanaries alone of all the archipelagoes were inhabited. In the third\r\ncolumn have you really materials to speak of confirming the proportion\r\nof winged and wingless insects on islands?\r\n\r\nYour comparison of plants of Madeira with islets of Great Britain is\r\nadmirable. (376/4. \"What should we say, for instance, if a plant so\r\ntotally unlike anything British as the Monizia edulis...were found\r\non one rocky islet of the Scillies, or another umbelliferous plant,\r\nMelanoselinum...on one mountain in Wales; or if the Isle of Wight and\r\nScilly Islands had varieties, species, and genera too, differing from\r\nanything in Britain, and found nowhere else in the world!\")\r\n\r\nI must allude to one of your last notes with very curious case of\r\nproportion of annuals in New Zealand. (376/5. On this subject see\r\nHildebrand's interesting paper \"Die Lebensdauer der Pflanzen\" (Engler's\r\n\"Botanische Jahrbucher,\" Volume II., 1882, page 51). He shows that\r\nannuals are rare in very dry desert-lands, in northern and alpine\r\nregions. The following table gives the percentages of annuals, etc., in\r\nvarious situations in Freiburg (Baden):--\r\n\r\n                            Annuals.  Biennials.  Perennials.  Trees and\r\n                                                                Shrubs.\r\n     Sandy, dry, and\r\n     stony places:            21         11           65           3\r\n\r\n     Dry fields:               6          4           90\r\n\r\n     Damp fields:             12          2           77           9\r\n\r\n     Woods and copses:         3          2           65          31\r\n\r\n     Water:                    3                      97\r\n\r\n     Cultivated land:         89                      11\r\n\r\nAre annuals adapted for short seasons, as in arctic regions, or tropical\r\ncountries with dry season, or for periodically disturbed and cultivated\r\nground? You speak of evergreen vegetation as leading to few or confined\r\nconditions; but is not evergreen vegetation connected with humid and\r\nequable climate? Does not a very humid climate almost imply (Tyndall) an\r\nequable one?\r\n\r\nI have never printed a word that I can remember about orchids and\r\npapilionaceous plants being few in islands on account of rarity of\r\ninsects; and I remember you screamed at me when I suggested this a\r\npropos of Papilionaceae in New Zealand, and of the statement about\r\nclover not seeding there till the hive-bee was introduced, as I stated\r\nin my paper in \"Gard. Chronicle.\" (376/6. \"In an old number of the\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle\" an extract is given from a New Zealand newspaper\r\nin which much surprise is expressed that the introduced clover never\r\nseeded freely until the hive-bee was introduced.\" \"On the Agency of Bees\r\nin the Fertilisation of Papilionaceous Flowers...\" (\"Gard. Chron.\" 1858,\r\npage 828). See Letter 362, note.) I have been these last few days vexed\r\nand annoyed to a foolish degree by hearing that my MS. on Domestic\r\nAnimals, etc., will make two volumes, both bigger than the \"Origin.\" The\r\nvolumes will have to be full-sized octavo, so I have written to Murray\r\nto suggest details to be printed in small type. But I feel that the size\r\nis quite ludicrous in relation to the subject. I am ready to swear at\r\nmyself and at every fool who writes a book.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 377. TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 15th [1867].\r\n\r\nThanks for your jolly letter. I have read your second article (377/1.\r\nThe lecture on Insular Floras was published in instalments in the\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle,\" January 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th, 1867.), and like\r\nit even more than the first, and more than this I cannot say. By mere\r\nchance I stumbled yesterday on a passage in Humboldt that a violet grows\r\non the Peak of Teneriffe in common with the Pyrenees. If Humboldt is\r\nright that the Canary Is. which lie nearest to the continent have a much\r\nstronger African character than the others, ought you not just to allude\r\nto this? I do not know whether you admit, and if so allude to, the view\r\nwhich seems to me probable, that most of the genera confined to the\r\nAtlantic islands (I do not say the species) originally existed in, and\r\nwere derived from, Europe, [and have] become extinct on this continent.\r\nI should thus account for the community of peculiar genera in the\r\nseveral Atlantic islands. About the Salvages is capital. (377/2. The\r\nSalvages are rocky islets about midway between Madeira and the Canaries;\r\nand they have an Atlantic flora, instead of, as might have been\r\nexpected, one composed of African immigrants. (\"Insular Floras,\" page 5\r\nof separate copy.)) I am glad you speak of LINKING, though this sounds\r\na little too close, instead of being continuous. All about St. Helena is\r\ngrand. You have no faith, but if I knew any one who lived in St. Helena\r\nI would supplicate him to send me home a cask or two of earth from a few\r\ninches beneath the surface from the upper part of the island, and from\r\nany dried-up pond, and thus, as sure as I'm a wriggler, I should receive\r\na multitude of lost plants.\r\n\r\nI did suggest to you to work out proportion of plants with irregular\r\nflowers on islands; I did this after giving a very short discussion\r\non irregular flowers in my Lythrum paper. (377/3. \"Linn. Soc. Journ.\"\r\nVIII., 1865, page 169.) But what on earth has a mere suggestion like\r\nthis to do with meum and tuum? You have comforted me much about the\r\nbigness of my book, which yet turns me sick when I think of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's More Letters of Charles Darwin, by Charles Darwin",
