And at the time I thought that so\r\nfar as he was concerned it was a true story.\r\n\r\nHe told it me with such a direct simplicity of conviction that I could\r\nnot do otherwise than believe in him. But in the morning, in my own\r\nflat, I woke to a different atmosphere, and as I lay in bed and\r\nrecalled the things he had told me, stripped of the glamour of his\r\nearnest slow voice, denuded of the focussed shaded table light, the\r\nshadowy atmosphere that wrapped about him and the pleasant bright\r\nthings, the dessert and glasses and napery of the dinner we had shared,\r\nmaking them for the time a bright little world quite cut off from\r\nevery-day realities, I saw it all as frankly incredible. “He was\r\nmystifying!” I said, and then: “How well he did it!. . . . . It isn’t\r\nquite the thing I should have expected him, of all people, to do well.”\r\n\r\nAfterwards, as I sat up in bed and sipped my morning tea, I found\r\nmyself trying to account for the flavour of reality that perplexed me\r\nin his impossible reminiscences, by supposing they did in some way\r\nsuggest, present, convey—I hardly know which word to use—experiences it\r\nwas otherwise impossible to tell.\r\n\r\nWell, I don’t resort to that explanation now. I have got over my\r\nintervening doubts. I believe now, as I believed at the moment of\r\ntelling, that Wallace did to the very best of his ability strip the\r\ntruth of his secret for me. But whether he himself saw, or only thought\r\nhe saw, whether he himself was the possessor of an inestimable\r\nprivilege, or the victim of a fantastic dream, I cannot pretend to\r\nguess. Even the facts of his death, which ended my doubts forever,\r\nthrow no light on that. That much the reader must judge for himself.\r\n\r\nI forget now what chance comment or criticism of mine moved so reticent\r\na man to confide in me. He was, I think, defending himself against an\r\nimputation of slackness and unreliability I had made in relation to a\r\ngreat public movement in which he had disappointed me. But he plunged\r\nsuddenly. “I have” he said, “a preoccupation—”\r\n\r\n“I know,” he went on, after a pause that he devoted to the study of his\r\ncigar ash, “I have been negligent. The fact is—it isn’t a case of\r\nghosts or apparitions—but—it’s an odd thing to tell of, Redmond—I am\r\nhaunted. I am haunted by something—that rather takes the light out of\r\nthings, that fills me with longings . . . . .”\r\n\r\nHe paused, checked by that English shyness that so often overcomes us\r\nwhen we would speak of moving or grave or beautiful things. “You were\r\nat Saint Athelstan’s all through,” he said, and for a moment that\r\nseemed to me quite irrelevant. “Well”—and he paused. Then very\r\nhaltingly at first, but afterwards more easily, he began to tell of the\r\nthing that was hidden in his life, the haunting memory of a beauty and\r\na happiness that filled his heart with insatiable longings that made\r\nall the interests and spectacle of worldly life seem dull and tedious\r\nand vain to him.\r\n\r\nNow that I have the clue to it, the thing seems written visibly in his\r\nface. I have a photograph in which that look of detachment has been\r\ncaught and intensified. It reminds me of what a woman once said of\r\nhim—a woman who had loved him greatly. “Suddenly,” she said, “the\r\ninterest goes out of him. He forgets you. He doesn’t care a rap for\r\nyou—under his very nose . . . . .”\r\n\r\nYet the interest was not always out of him, and when he was holding his\r\nattention to a thing Wallace could contrive to be an extremely\r\nsuccessful man. His career, indeed, is set with successes. He left me\r\nbehind him long ago; he soared up over my head, and cut a figure in the\r\nworld that I couldn’t cut—anyhow. He was still a year short of forty,\r\nand they say now that he would have been in office and very probably in\r\nthe new Cabinet if he had lived. At school he always beat me without\r\neffort—as it were by nature. We were at school together at Saint\r\nAthelstan’s College in West Kensington for almost all our school time.\r\nHe came into the school as my co-equal, but he left far above me, in a\r\nblaze of scholarships and brilliant performance. Yet I think I made a\r\nfair average running. And it was at school I heard first of the Door in\r\nthe Wall—that I was to hear of a second time only a month before his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nTo him at least the Door in the Wall was a real door leading through a\r\nreal wall to immortal realities. Of that I am now quite assured.\r\n\r\nAnd it came into his life early, when he was a little fellow between\r\nfive and six. I remember how, as he sat making his confession to me\r\nwith a slow gravity, he reasoned and reckoned the date of it. “There\r\nwas,” he said, “a crimson Virginia creeper in it—all one bright uniform\r\ncrimson in a clear amber sunshine against a white wall. That came into\r\nthe impression somehow, though I don’t clearly remember how, and there\r\nwere horse-chestnut leaves upon the clean pavement outside the green\r\ndoor. They were blotched yellow and green, you know, not brown nor\r\ndirty, so that they must have been new fallen. I take it that means\r\nOctober. I look out for horse-chestnut leaves every year, and I ought\r\nto know.\r\n\r\n“If I’m right in that, I was about five years and four months old.”\r\n\r\nHe was, he said, rather a precocious little boy—he learned to talk at\r\nan abnormally early age, and he was so sane and “old-fashioned,” as\r\npeople say, that he was permitted an amount of initiative that most\r\nchildren scarcely attain by seven or eight. His mother died when he was\r\nborn, and he was under the less vigilant and authoritative care of a\r\nnursery governess. His father was a stern, preoccupied lawyer, who gave\r\nhim little attention, and expected great things of him. For all his\r\nbrightness he found life a little grey and dull I think. And one day he\r\nwandered.\r\n\r\nHe could not recall the particular neglect that enabled him to get\r\naway, nor the course he took among the West Kensington roads. All that\r\nhad faded among the incurable blurs of memory. But the white wall and\r\nthe green door stood out quite distinctly.\r\n\r\nAs his memory of that remote childish experience ran, he did at the\r\nvery first sight of that door experience a peculiar emotion, an\r\nattraction, a desire to get to the door and open it and walk in. And at\r\nthe same time he had the clearest conviction that either it was unwise\r\nor it was wrong of him—he could not tell which—to yield to this\r\nattraction. He insisted upon it as a curious thing that he knew from\r\nthe very beginning—unless memory has played him the queerest trick—that\r\nthe door was unfastened, and that he could go in as he chose.\r\n\r\nI seem to see the figure of that little boy, drawn and repelled. And it\r\nwas very clear in his mind, too, though why it should be so was never\r\nexplained, that his father would be very angry if he went through that\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nWallace described all these moments of hesitation to me with the utmost\r\nparticularity. He went right past the door, and then, with his hands in\r\nhis pockets, and making an infantile attempt to whistle, strolled right\r\nalong beyond the end of the wall. There he recalls a number of mean,\r\ndirty shops, and particularly that of a plumber and decorator, with a\r\ndusty disorder of earthenware pipes, sheet lead ball taps, pattern\r\nbooks of wall paper, and tins of enamel. He stood pretending to examine\r\nthese things, and coveting, passionately desiring the green door.\r\n\r\nThen, he said, he had a gust of emotion. He made a run for it, lest\r\nhesitation should grip him again, he went plump with outstretched hand\r\nthrough the green door and let it slam behind him. And so, in a trice,\r\nhe came into the garden that has haunted all his life.\r\n\r\nIt was very difficult for Wallace to give me his full sense of that\r\ngarden into which he came.\r\n\r\nThere was something in the very air of it that exhilarated, that gave\r\none a sense of lightness and good happening and well being; there was\r\nsomething in the sight of it that made all its colour clean and perfect\r\nand subtly luminous. In the instant of coming into it one was\r\nexquisitely glad—as only in rare moments and when one is young and\r\njoyful one can be glad in this world. And everything was beautiful\r\nthere . . . . .\r\n\r\nWallace mused before he went on telling me. “You see,” he said, with\r\nthe doubtful inflection of a man who pauses at incredible things,\r\n“there were two great panthers there . . . Yes, spotted panthers. And I\r\nwas not afraid. There was a long wide path with marble-edged flower\r\nborders on either side, and these two huge velvety beasts were playing\r\nthere with a ball. One looked up and came towards me, a little curious\r\nas it seemed. It came right up to me, rubbed its soft round ear very\r\ngently against the small hand I held out and purred. It was, I tell\r\nyou, an enchanted garden. I know. And the size? Oh! it stretched far\r\nand wide, this way and that. I believe there were hills far away.\r\nHeaven knows where West Kensington had suddenly got to. And somehow it\r\nwas just like coming home.\r\n\r\n“You know, in the very moment the door swung to behind me, I forgot the\r\nroad with its fallen chestnut leaves, its cabs and tradesmen’s carts, I\r\nforgot the sort of gravitational pull back to the discipline and\r\nobedience of home, I forgot all hesitations and fear, forgot\r\ndiscretion, forgot all the intimate realities of this life. I became in\r\na moment a very glad and wonder-happy little boy—in another world. It\r\nwas a world with a different quality, a warmer, more penetrating and\r\nmellower light, with a faint clear gladness in its air, and wisps of\r\nsun-touched cloud in the blueness of its sky. And before me ran this\r\nlong wide path, invitingly, with weedless beds on either side, rich\r\nwith untended flowers, and these two great panthers. I put my little\r\nhands fearlessly on their soft fur, and caressed their round ears and\r\nthe sensitive corners under their ears, and played with them, and it\r\nwas as though they welcomed me home. There was a keen sense of\r\nhome-coming in my mind, and when presently a tall, fair girl appeared\r\nin the pathway and came to meet me, smiling, and said Well?’ to me, and\r\nlifted me, and kissed me, and put me down, and led me by the hand,\r\nthere was no amazement, but only an impression of delightful rightness,\r\nof being reminded of happy things that had in some strange way been\r\noverlooked. There were broad steps, I remember, that came into view\r\nbetween spikes of delphinium, and up these we went to a great avenue\r\nbetween very old and shady dark trees. All down this avenue, you know,\r\nbetween the red chapped stems, were marble seats of honour and\r\nstatuary, and very tame and friendly white doves . . . . .\r\n\r\n“And along this avenue my girl-friend led me, looking down—I recall the\r\npleasant lines, the finely-modelled chin of her sweet kind face—asking\r\nme questions in a soft, agreeable voice, and telling me things,\r\npleasant things I know, though what they were I was never able to\r\nrecall . . . And presently a little Capuchin monkey, very clean, with a\r\nfur of ruddy brown and kindly hazel eyes, came down a tree to us and\r\nran beside me, looking up at me and grinning, and presently leapt to my\r\nshoulder. So we went on our way in great happiness . . . .”\r\n\r\nHe paused.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I remember little things. We passed an old man musing among laurels, I\r\nremember, and a place gay with paroquets, and came through a broad\r\nshaded colonnade to a spacious cool palace, full of pleasant fountains,\r\nfull of beautiful things, full of the quality and promise of heart’s\r\ndesire. And there were many things and many people, some that still\r\nseem to stand out clearly and some that are a little vague, but all\r\nthese people were beautiful and kind. In some way—I don’t know how—it\r\nwas conveyed to me that they all were kind to me, glad to have me\r\nthere, and filling me with gladness by their gestures, by the touch of\r\ntheir hands, by the welcome and love in their eyes. Yes—”\r\n\r\nHe mused for awhile. “Playmates I found there. That was very much to\r\nme, because I was a lonely little boy. They played delightful games in\r\na grass-covered court where there was a sun-dial set about with\r\nflowers. And as one played one loved . . . .\r\n\r\n“But—it’s odd—there’s a gap in my memory. I don’t remember the games we\r\nplayed. I never remembered. Afterwards, as a child, I spent long hours\r\ntrying, even with tears, to recall the form of that happiness. I wanted\r\nto play it all over again—in my nursery—by myself. No! All I remember\r\nis the happiness and two dear playfellows who were most with me . . . .\r\nThen presently came a sombre dark woman, with a grave, pale face and\r\ndreamy eyes, a sombre woman wearing a soft long robe of pale purple,\r\nwho carried a book and beckoned and took me aside with her into a\r\ngallery above a hall—though my playmates were loth to have me go, and\r\nceased their game and stood watching as I was carried away. ‘Come back\r\nto us!’ they cried. ‘Come back to us soon!’ I looked up at her face,\r\nbut she heeded them not at all. Her face was very gentle and grave. She\r\ntook me to a seat in the gallery, and I stood beside her, ready to look\r\nat her book as she opened it upon her knee. The pages fell open. She\r\npointed, and I looked, marvelling, for in the living pages of that book\r\nI saw myself; it was a story about myself, and in it were all the\r\nthings that had happened to me since ever I was born . . . .\r\n\r\n“It was wonderful to me, because the pages of that book were not\r\npictures, you understand, but realities.”\r\n\r\nWallace paused gravely—looked at me doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” I said. “I understand.”\r\n\r\n“They were realities—yes, they must have been; people moved and things\r\ncame and went in them; my dear mother, whom I had near forgotten; then\r\nmy father, stern and upright, the servants, the nursery, all the\r\nfamiliar things of home. Then the front door and the busy streets, with\r\ntraffic to and fro: I looked and marvelled, and looked half doubtfully\r\nagain into the woman’s face and turned the pages over, skipping this\r\nand that, to see more of this book, and more, and so at last I came to\r\nmyself hovering and hesitating outside the green door in the long white\r\nwall, and felt again the conflict and the fear.\r\n\r\n“‘And next?’ I cried, and would have turned on, but the cool hand of\r\nthe grave woman delayed me.\r\n\r\n“‘Next?’ I insisted, and struggled gently with her hand, pulling up her\r\nfingers with all my childish strength, and as she yielded and the page\r\ncame over she bent down upon me like a shadow and kissed my brow.\r\n\r\n“But the page did not show the enchanted garden, nor the panthers, nor\r\nthe girl who had led me by the hand, nor the playfellows who had been\r\nso loth to let me go. It showed a long grey street in West Kensington,\r\non that chill hour of afternoon before the lamps are lit, and I was\r\nthere, a wretched little figure, weeping aloud, for all that I could do\r\nto restrain myself, and I was weeping because I could not return to my\r\ndear play-fellows who had called after me, ‘Come back to us! Come back\r\nto us soon!’ I was there. This was no page in a book, but harsh\r\nreality; that enchanted place and the restraining hand of the grave\r\nmother at whose knee I stood had gone—whither have they gone?”\r\n\r\nHe halted again, and remained for a time, staring into the fire.\r\n\r\n“Oh! the wretchedness of that return!” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“Well?” I said after a minute or so.\r\n\r\n“Poor little wretch I was—brought back to this grey world again! As I\r\nrealised the fulness of what had happened to me, I gave way to quite\r\nungovernable grief. And the shame and humiliation of that public\r\nweeping and my disgraceful homecoming remain with me still. I see again\r\nthe benevolent-looking old gentleman in gold spectacles who stopped and\r\nspoke to me—prodding me first with his umbrella. ‘Poor little chap,’\r\nsaid he; ‘and are you lost then?’—and me a London boy of five and more!\r\nAnd he must needs bring in a kindly young policeman and make a crowd of\r\nme, and so march me home. Sobbing, conspicuous and frightened, I came\r\nfrom the enchanted garden to the steps of my father’s house.\r\n\r\n“That is as well as I can remember my vision of that garden—the garden\r\nthat haunts me still. Of course, I can convey nothing of that\r\nindescribable quality of translucent unreality, that difference from\r\nthe common things of experience that hung about it all; but that—that\r\nis what happened. If it was a dream, I am sure it was a day-time and\r\naltogether extraordinary dream . . . . . . H’m!—naturally there\r\nfollowed a terrible questioning, by my aunt, my father, the nurse, the\r\ngoverness—everyone . . . . . .\r\n\r\n“I tried to tell them, and my father gave me my first thrashing for\r\ntelling lies. When afterwards I tried to tell my aunt, she punished me\r\nagain for my wicked persistence. Then, as I said, everyone was\r\nforbidden to listen to me, to hear a word about it. Even my fairy tale\r\nbooks were taken away from me for a time—because I was ‘too\r\nimaginative.’ Eh? Yes, they did that! My father belonged to the old\r\nschool . . . . . And my story was driven back upon myself. I whispered\r\nit to my pillow—my pillow that was often damp and salt to my whispering\r\nlips with childish tears. And I added always to my official and less\r\nfervent prayers this one heartfelt request: ‘Please God I may dream of\r\nthe garden. Oh! take me back to my garden! Take me back to my garden!’\r\n\r\n“I dreamt often of the garden. I may have added to it, I may have\r\nchanged it; I do not know . . . . . All this you understand is an\r\nattempt to reconstruct from fragmentary memories a very early\r\nexperience. Between that and the other consecutive memories of my\r\nboyhood there is a gulf. A time came when it seemed impossible I should\r\never speak of that wonder glimpse again.”\r\n\r\nI asked an obvious question.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said. “I don’t remember that I ever attempted to find my way\r\nback to the garden in those early years. This seems odd to me now, but\r\nI think that very probably a closer watch was kept on my movements\r\nafter this misadventure to prevent my going astray. No, it wasn’t until\r\nyou knew me that I tried for the garden again. And I believe there was\r\na period—incredible as it seems now—when I forgot the garden\r\naltogether—when I was about eight or nine it may have been. Do you\r\nremember me as a kid at Saint Athelstan’s?”\r\n\r\n“Rather!”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t show any signs did I in those days of having a secret dream?”\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHe looked up with a sudden smile.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever play North-West Passage with me? . . . . . No, of course\r\nyou didn’t come my way!”\r\n\r\n“It was the sort of game,” he went on, “that every imaginative child\r\nplays all day. The idea was the discovery of a North-West Passage to\r\nschool. The way to school was plain enough; the game consisted in\r\nfinding some way that wasn’t plain, starting off ten minutes early in\r\nsome almost hopeless direction, and working one’s way round through\r\nunaccustomed streets to my goal. And one day I got entangled among some\r\nrather low-class streets on the other side of Campden Hill, and I began\r\nto think that for once the game would be against me and that I should\r\nget to school late. I tried rather desperately a street that seemed a\r\n_cul de sac_, and found a passage at the end. I hurried through that\r\nwith renewed hope. ‘I shall do it yet,’ I said, and passed a row of\r\nfrowsy little shops that were inexplicably familiar to me, and behold!\r\nthere was my long white wall and the green door that led to the\r\nenchanted garden!\r\n\r\n“The thing whacked upon me suddenly. Then, after all, that garden, that\r\nwonderful garden, wasn’t a dream!” . . . .\r\n\r\nHe paused.\r\n\r\n“I suppose my second experience with the green door marks the world of\r\ndifference there is between the busy life of a schoolboy and the\r\ninfinite leisure of a child. Anyhow, this second time I didn’t for a\r\nmoment think of going in straight away. You see . . . For one thing my\r\nmind was full of the idea of getting to school in time—set on not\r\nbreaking my record for punctuality. I must surely have felt _some_\r\nlittle desire at least to try the door—yes, I must have felt that . . .\r\n. . But I seem to remember the attraction of the door mainly as another\r\nobstacle to my overmastering determination to get to school. I was\r\nimmediately interested by this discovery I had made, of course—I went\r\non with my mind full of it—but I went on. It didn’t check me. I ran\r\npast tugging out my watch, found I had ten minutes still to spare, and\r\nthen I was going downhill into familiar surroundings. I got to school,\r\nbreathless, it is true, and wet with perspiration, but in time. I can\r\nremember hanging up my coat and hat . . . Went right by it and left it\r\nbehind me. Odd, eh?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me thoughtfully. “Of course, I didn’t know then that it\r\nwouldn’t always be there. School boys have limited imaginations. I\r\nsuppose I thought it was an awfully jolly thing to have it there, to\r\nknow my way back to it, but there was the school tugging at me. I\r\nexpect I was a good deal distraught and inattentive that morning,\r\nrecalling what I could of the beautiful strange people I should\r\npresently see again. Oddly enough I had no doubt in my mind that they\r\nwould be glad to see me . . . Yes, I must have thought of the garden\r\nthat morning just as a jolly sort of place to which one might resort in\r\nthe interludes of a strenuous scholastic career.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t go that day at all. The next day was a half holiday, and that\r\nmay have weighed with me. Perhaps, too, my state of inattention brought\r\ndown impositions upon me and docked the margin of time necessary for\r\nthe detour. I don’t know. What I do know is that in the meantime the\r\nenchanted garden was so much upon my mind that I could not keep it to\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n“I told—What was his name?—a ferrety-looking youngster we used to call\r\nSquiff.”\r\n\r\n“Young Hopkins,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Hopkins it was. I did not like telling him, I had a feeling that in\r\nsome way it was against the rules to tell him, but I did. He was\r\nwalking part of the way home with me; he was talkative, and if we had\r\nnot talked about the enchanted garden we should have talked of\r\nsomething else, and it was intolerable to me to think about any other\r\nsubject. So I blabbed.\r\n\r\n“Well, he told my secret. The next day in the play interval I found\r\nmyself surrounded by half a dozen bigger boys, half teasing and wholly\r\ncurious to hear more of the enchanted garden. There was that big\r\nFawcett—you remember him?—and Carnaby and Morley Reynolds. You weren’t\r\nthere by any chance? No, I think I should have remembered if you were .\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n“A boy is a creature of odd feelings. I was, I really believe, in spite\r\nof my secret self-disgust, a little flattered to have the attention of\r\nthese big fellows. I remember particularly a moment of pleasure caused\r\nby the praise of Crawshaw—you remember Crawshaw major, the son of\r\nCrawshaw the composer?—who said it was the best lie he had ever heard.\r\nBut at the same time there was a really painful undertow of shame at\r\ntelling what I felt was indeed a sacred secret. That beast Fawcett made\r\na joke about the girl in green—.”\r\n\r\nWallace’s voice sank with the keen memory of that shame. “I pretended\r\nnot to hear,” he said. “Well, then Carnaby suddenly called me a young\r\nliar and disputed with me when I said the thing was true. I said I knew\r\nwhere to find the green door, could lead them all there in ten minutes.\r\nCarnaby became outrageously virtuous, and said I’d have to—and bear out\r\nmy words or suffer. Did you ever have Carnaby twist your arm? Then\r\nperhaps you’ll understand how it went with me. I swore my story was\r\ntrue. There was nobody in the school then to save a chap from Carnaby\r\nthough Crawshaw put in a word or so. Carnaby had got his game. I grew\r\nexcited and red-eared, and a little frightened, I behaved altogether\r\nlike a silly little chap, and the outcome of it all was that instead of\r\nstarting alone for my enchanted garden, I led the way presently—cheeks\r\nflushed, ears hot, eyes smarting, and my soul one burning misery and\r\nshame—for a party of six mocking, curious and threatening\r\nschool-fellows.\r\n\r\n“We never found the white wall and the green door . . .”\r\n\r\n“You mean?—”\r\n\r\n“I mean I couldn’t find it. I would have found it if I could.\r\n\r\n“And afterwards when I could go alone I couldn’t find it. I never found\r\nit. I seem now to have been always looking for it through my school-boy\r\ndays, but I’ve never come upon it again.”\r\n\r\n“Did the fellows—make it disagreeable?”\r\n\r\n“Beastly . . . . . Carnaby held a council over me for wanton lying. I\r\nremember how I sneaked home and upstairs to hide the marks of my\r\nblubbering. But when I cried myself to sleep at last it wasn’t for\r\nCarnaby, but for the garden, for the beautiful afternoon I had hoped\r\nfor, for the sweet friendly women and the waiting playfellows and the\r\ngame I had hoped to learn again, that beautiful forgotten game . . . .\r\n.\r\n\r\n“I believed firmly that if I had not told— . . . . . I had bad times\r\nafter that—crying at night and wool-gathering by day. For two terms I\r\nslackened and had bad reports. Do you remember? Of course you would! It\r\nwas _you_—your beating me in mathematics that brought me back to the\r\ngrind again.”\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFor a time my friend stared silently into the red heart of the fire.\r\nThen he said: “I never saw it again until I was seventeen.\r\n\r\n“It leapt upon me for the third time—as I was driving to Paddington on\r\nmy way to Oxford and a scholarship. I had just one momentary glimpse. I\r\nwas leaning over the apron of my hansom smoking a cigarette, and no\r\ndoubt thinking myself no end of a man of the world, and suddenly there\r\nwas the door, the wall, the dear sense of unforgettable and still\r\nattainable things.\r\n\r\n“We clattered by—I too taken by surprise to stop my cab until we were\r\nwell past and round a corner. Then I had a queer moment, a double and\r\ndivergent movement of my will: I tapped the little door in the roof of\r\nthe cab, and brought my arm down to pull out my watch. ‘Yes, sir!’ said\r\nthe cabman, smartly. ‘Er—well—it’s nothing,’ I cried. ‘_My_ mistake! We\r\nhaven’t much time! Go on!’ and he went on . . .\r\n\r\n“I got my scholarship. And the night after I was told of that I sat\r\nover my fire in my little upper room, my study, in my father’s house,\r\nwith his praise—his rare praise—and his sound counsels ringing in my\r\nears, and I smoked my favourite pipe—the formidable bulldog of\r\nadolescence—and thought of that door in the long white wall. ‘If I had\r\nstopped,’ I thought, ‘I should have missed my scholarship, I should\r\nhave missed Oxford—muddled all the fine career before me! I begin to\r\nsee things better!’ I fell musing deeply, but I did not doubt then this\r\ncareer of mine was a thing that merited sacrifice.\r\n\r\n“Those dear friends and that clear atmosphere seemed very sweet to me,\r\nvery fine, but remote. My grip was fixing now upon the world. I saw\r\nanother door opening—the door of my career.”\r\n\r\nHe stared again into the fire. Its red lights picked out a stubborn\r\nstrength in his face for just one flickering moment, and then it\r\nvanished again.\r\n\r\n“Well”, he said and sighed, “I have served that career. I have\r\ndone—much work, much hard work. But I have dreamt of the enchanted\r\ngarden a thousand dreams, and seen its door, or at least glimpsed its\r\ndoor, four times since then. Yes—four times. For a while this world was\r\nso bright and interesting, seemed so full of meaning and opportunity\r\nthat the half-effaced charm of the garden was by comparison gentle and\r\nremote. Who wants to pat panthers on the way to dinner with pretty\r\nwomen and distinguished men? I came down to London from Oxford, a man\r\nof bold promise that I have done something to redeem. Something—and yet\r\nthere have been disappointments . . . . .\r\n\r\n“Twice I have been in love—I will not dwell on that—but once, as I went\r\nto someone who, I know, doubted whether I dared to come, I took a short\r\ncut at a venture through an unfrequented road near Earl’s Court, and so\r\nhappened on a white wall and a familiar green door. ‘Odd!’ said I to\r\nmyself, ‘but I thought this place was on Campden Hill. It’s the place I\r\nnever could find somehow—like counting Stonehenge—the place of that\r\nqueer day dream of mine.’ And I went by it intent upon my purpose. It\r\nhad no appeal to me that afternoon.\r\n\r\n“I had just a moment’s impulse to try the door, three steps aside were\r\nneeded at the most—though I was sure enough in my heart that it would\r\nopen to me—and then I thought that doing so might delay me on the way\r\nto that appointment in which I thought my honour was involved.\r\nAfterwards I was sorry for my punctuality—I might at least have peeped\r\nin I thought, and waved a hand to those panthers, but I knew enough by\r\nthis time not to seek again belatedly that which is not found by\r\nseeking. Yes, that time made me very sorry . . . . .\r\n\r\n“Years of hard work after that and never a sight of the door. It’s only\r\nrecently it has come back to me. With it there has come a sense as\r\nthough some thin tarnish had spread itself over my world. I began to\r\nthink of it as a sorrowful and bitter thing that I should never see\r\nthat door again. Perhaps I was suffering a little from overwork—perhaps\r\nit was what I’ve heard spoken of as the feeling of forty. I don’t know.\r\nBut certainly the keen brightness that makes effort easy has gone out\r\nof things recently, and that just at a time with all these new\r\npolitical developments—when I ought to be working. Odd, isn’t it? But I\r\ndo begin to find life toilsome, its rewards, as I come near them,\r\ncheap. I began a little while ago to want the garden quite badly.\r\nYes—and I’ve seen it three times.”\r\n\r\n“The garden?”\r\n\r\n“No—the door! And I haven’t gone in!”\r\n\r\nHe leaned over the table to me, with an enormous sorrow in his voice as\r\nhe spoke. “Thrice I have had my chance—_thrice!_ If ever that door\r\noffers itself to me again, I swore, I will go in out of this dust and\r\nheat, out of this dry glitter of vanity, out of these toilsome\r\nfutilities. I will go and never return. This time I will stay . . . . .\r\nI swore it and when the time came—_I didn’t go_.\r\n\r\n“Three times in one year have I passed that door and failed to enter.\r\nThree times in the last year.\r\n\r\n“The first time was on the night of the snatch division on the Tenants’\r\nRedemption Bill, on which the Government was saved by a majority of\r\nthree. You remember? No one on our side—perhaps very few on the\r\nopposite side—expected the end that night. Then the debate collapsed\r\nlike eggshells. I and Hotchkiss were dining with his cousin at\r\nBrentford, we were both unpaired, and we were called up by telephone,\r\nand set off at once in his cousin’s motor. We got in barely in time,\r\nand on the way we passed my wall and door—livid in the moonlight,\r\nblotched with hot yellow as the glare of our lamps lit it, but\r\nunmistakable. ‘My God!’ cried I. ‘What?’ said Hotchkiss. ‘Nothing!’ I\r\nanswered, and the moment passed.\r\n\r\n“‘I’ve made a great sacrifice,’ I told the whip as I got in. They all\r\nhave,’ he said, and hurried by.\r\n\r\n“I do not see how I could have done otherwise then. And the next\r\noccasion was as I rushed to my father’s bedside to bid that stern old\r\nman farewell. Then, too, the claims of life were imperative. But the\r\nthird time was different; it happened a week ago. It fills me with hot\r\nremorse to recall it. I was with Gurker and Ralphs—it’s no secret now\r\nyou know that I’ve had my talk with Gurker. We had been dining at\r\nFrobisher’s, and the talk had become intimate between us. The question\r\nof my place in the reconstructed ministry lay always just over the\r\nboundary of the discussion. Yes—yes. That’s all settled. It needn’t be\r\ntalked about yet, but there’s no reason to keep a secret from you . . .\r\n. . Yes—thanks! thanks! But let me tell you my story.\r\n\r\n“Then, on that night things were very much in the air. My position was\r\na very delicate one. I was keenly anxious to get some definite word\r\nfrom Gurker, but was hampered by Ralphs’ presence. I was using the best\r\npower of my brain to keep that light and careless talk not too\r\nobviously directed to the point that concerns me. I had to. Ralphs’\r\nbehaviour since has more than justified my caution . . . . . Ralphs, I\r\nknew, would leave us beyond the Kensington High Street, and then I\r\ncould surprise Gurker by a sudden frankness. One has sometimes to\r\nresort to these little devices. . . . . And then it was that in the\r\nmargin of my field of vision I became aware once more of the white\r\nwall, the green door before us down the road.\r\n\r\n“We passed it talking. I passed it. I can still see the shadow of\r\nGurker’s marked profile, his opera hat tilted forward over his\r\nprominent nose, the many folds of his neck wrap going before my shadow\r\nand Ralphs’ as we sauntered past.\r\n\r\n“I passed within twenty inches of the door. ‘If I say good-night to\r\nthem, and go in,’ I asked myself, ‘what will happen?’ And I was all\r\na-tingle for that word with Gurker.\r\n\r\n“I could not answer that question in the tangle of my other problems.\r\n‘They will think me mad,’ I thought. ‘And suppose I vanish now!—Amazing\r\ndisappearance of a prominent politician!’ That weighed with me. A\r\nthousand inconceivably petty worldlinesses weighed with me in that\r\ncrisis.”\r\n\r\nThen he turned on me with a sorrowful smile, and, speaking slowly;\r\n“Here I am!” he said.\r\n\r\n“Here I am!” he repeated, “and my chance has gone from me. Three times\r\nin one year the door has been offered me—the door that goes into peace,\r\ninto delight, into a beauty beyond dreaming, a kindness no man on earth\r\ncan know. And I have rejected it, Redmond, and it has gone—”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“I know. I know. I am left now to work it out, to stick to the tasks\r\nthat held me so strongly when my moments came. You say, I have\r\nsuccess—this vulgar, tawdry, irksome, envied thing. I have it.” He had\r\na walnut in his big hand. “If that was my success,” he said, and\r\ncrushed it, and held it out for me to see.\r\n\r\n“Let me tell you something, Redmond. This loss is destroying me. For\r\ntwo months, for ten weeks nearly now, I have done no work at all,\r\nexcept the most necessary and urgent duties. My soul is full of\r\ninappeasable regrets. At nights—when it is less likely I shall be\r\nrecognised—I go out. I wander. Yes. I wonder what people would think of\r\nthat if they knew. A Cabinet Minister, the responsible head of that\r\nmost vital of all departments, wandering alone—grieving—sometimes near\r\naudibly lamenting—for a door, for a garden!”\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI can see now his rather pallid face, and the unfamiliar sombre fire\r\nthat had come into his eyes. I see him very vividly to-night. I sit\r\nrecalling his words, his tones, and last evening’s _Westminster\r\nGazette_ still lies on my sofa, containing the notice of his death. At\r\nlunch to-day the club was busy with him and the strange riddle of his\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThey found his body very early yesterday morning in a deep excavation\r\nnear East Kensington Station. It is one of two shafts that have been\r\nmade in connection with an extension of the railway southward. It is\r\nprotected from the intrusion of the public by a hoarding upon the high\r\nroad, in which a small doorway has been cut for the convenience of some\r\nof the workmen who live in that direction. The doorway was left\r\nunfastened through a misunderstanding between two gangers, and through\r\nit he made his way . . . . .\r\n\r\nMy mind is darkened with questions and riddles.\r\n\r\nIt would seem he walked all the way from the House that night—he has\r\nfrequently walked home during the past Session—and so it is I figure\r\nhis dark form coming along the late and empty streets, wrapped up,\r\nintent. And then did the pale electric lights near the station cheat\r\nthe rough planking into a semblance of white? Did that fatal unfastened\r\ndoor awaken some memory?\r\n\r\nWas there, after all, ever any green door in the wall at all?\r\n\r\nI do not know. I have told his story as he told it to me. There are\r\ntimes when I believe that Wallace was no more than the victim of the\r\ncoincidence between a rare but not unprecedented type of hallucination\r\nand a careless trap, but that indeed is not my profoundest belief. You\r\nmay think me superstitious if you will, and foolish; but, indeed, I am\r\nmore than half convinced that he had in truth, an abnormal gift, and a\r\nsense, something—I know not what—that in the guise of wall and door\r\noffered him an outlet, a secret and peculiar passage of escape into\r\nanother and altogether more beautiful world. At any rate, you will say,\r\nit betrayed him in the end. But did it betray him? There you touch the\r\ninmost mystery of these dreamers, these men of vision and the\r\nimagination. We see our world fair and common, the hoarding and the\r\npit. By our daylight standard he walked out of security into darkness,\r\ndanger and death. But did he see like that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the first day of the New Year that the announcement was made,\r\nalmost simultaneously from three observatories, that the motion of the\r\nplanet Neptune, the outermost of all the planets that wheel about the\r\nsun, had become very erratic. Ogilvy had already called attention to a\r\nsuspected retardation in its velocity in December. Such a piece of news\r\nwas scarcely calculated to interest a world the greater portion of\r\nwhose inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet Neptune,\r\nnor outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of\r\na faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet\r\ncause any very great excitement. Scientific people, however, found the\r\nintelligence remarkable enough, even before it became known that the\r\nnew body was rapidly growing larger and brighter, that its motion was\r\nquite different from the orderly progress of the planets, and that the\r\ndeflection of Neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an\r\nunprecedented kind.\r\n\r\nFew people without a training in science can realise the huge isolation\r\nof the solar system. The sun with its specks of planets, its dust of\r\nplanetoids, and its impalpable comets, swims in a vacant immensity that\r\nalmost defeats the imagination. Beyond the orbit of Neptune there is\r\nspace, vacant so far as human observation has penetrated, without\r\nwarmth or light or sound, blank emptiness, for twenty million times a\r\nmillion miles. That is the smallest estimate of the distance to be\r\ntraversed before the very nearest of the stars is attained. And, saving\r\na few comets more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame, no matter had\r\never to human knowledge crossed this gulf of space, until early in the\r\ntwentieth century this strange wanderer appeared. A vast mass of matter\r\nit was, bulky, heavy, rushing without warning out of the black mystery\r\nof the sky into the radiance of the sun. By the second day it was\r\nclearly visible to any decent instrument, as a speck with a barely\r\nsensible diameter, in the constellation Leo near Regulus. In a little\r\nwhile an opera glass could attain it.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two\r\nhemispheres were made aware for the first time of the real importance\r\nof this unusual apparition in the heavens. “A Planetary Collision,” one\r\nLondon paper headed the news, and proclaimed Duchaine’s opinion that\r\nthis strange new planet would probably collide with Neptune. The leader\r\nwriters enlarged upon the topic; so that in most of the capitals of the\r\nworld, on January 3rd, there was an expectation, however vague of some\r\nimminent phenomenon in the sky; and as the night followed the sunset\r\nround the globe, thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to see—the\r\nold familiar stars just as they had always been.\r\n\r\nUntil it was dawn in London and Pollux setting and the stars overhead\r\ngrown pale. The Winter’s dawn it was, a sickly filtering accumulation\r\nof daylight, and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the\r\nwindows to show where people were astir. But the yawning policeman saw\r\nthe thing, the busy crowds in the markets stopped agape, workmen going\r\nto their work betimes, milkmen, the drivers of news-carts, dissipation\r\ngoing home jaded and pale, homeless wanderers, sentinels on their\r\nbeats, and in the country, labourers trudging afield, poachers slinking\r\nhome, all over the dusky quickening country it could be seen—and out at\r\nsea by seamen watching for the day—a great white star, come suddenly\r\ninto the westward sky!\r\n\r\nBrighter it was than any star in our skies; brighter than the evening\r\nstar at its brightest. It still glowed out white and large, no mere\r\ntwinkling spot of light, but a small round clear shining disc, an hour\r\nafter the day had come. And where science has not reached, men stared\r\nand feared, telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are\r\nforeshadowed by these fiery signs in the Heavens. Sturdy Boers, dusky\r\nHottentots, Gold Coast Negroes, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Portuguese, stood\r\nin the warmth of the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new\r\nstar.\r\n\r\nAnd in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement,\r\nrising almost to shouting pitch, as the two remote bodies had rushed\r\ntogether; and a hurrying to and fro, to gather photographic apparatus\r\nand spectroscope, and this appliance and that, to record this novel\r\nastonishing sight, the destruction of a world. For it was a world, a\r\nsister planet of our earth, far greater than our earth indeed, that had\r\nso suddenly flashed into flaming death. Neptune it was, had been\r\nstruck, fairly and squarely, by the strange planet from outer space and\r\nthe heat of the concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes\r\ninto one vast mass of incandescence. Round the world that day, two\r\nhours before the dawn, went the pallid great white star, fading only as\r\nit sank westward and the sun mounted above it. Everywhere men marvelled\r\nat it, but of all those who saw it none could have marvelled more than\r\nthose sailors, habitual watchers of the stars, who far away at sea had\r\nheard nothing of its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and\r\nclimb zenithward and hang overhead and sink westward with the passing\r\nof the night.\r\n\r\nAnd when next it rose over Europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on\r\nhilly slopes, on house-roofs, in open spaces, staring eastward for the\r\nrising of the great new star. It rose with a white glow in front of it,\r\nlike the glare of a white fire, and those who had seen it come into\r\nexistence the night before cried out at the sight of it. “It is\r\nlarger,” they cried. “It is brighter!” And, indeed the moon a quarter\r\nfull and sinking in the west was in its apparent size beyond\r\ncomparison, but scarcely in all its breadth had it as much brightness\r\nnow as the little circle of the strange new star.\r\n\r\n“It is brighter!” cried the people clustering in the streets. But in\r\nthe dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one\r\nanother. “_It is nearer_,” they said. “_Nearer!_”\r\n\r\nAnd voice after voice repeated, “It is nearer,” and the clicking\r\ntelegraph took that up, and it trembled along telephone wires, and in a\r\nthousand cities grimy compositors fingered the type. “It is nearer.”\r\nMen writing in offices, struck with a strange realisation, flung down\r\ntheir pens, men talking in a thousand places suddenly came upon a\r\ngrotesque possibility in those words, “It is nearer.” It hurried along\r\nwakening streets, it was shouted down the frost-stilled ways of quiet\r\nvillages; men who had read these things from the throbbing tape stood\r\nin yellow-lit doorways shouting the news to the passersby. “It is\r\nnearer.” Pretty women, flushed and glittering, heard the news told\r\njestingly between the dances, and feigned an intelligent interest they\r\ndid not feel. “Nearer! Indeed. How curious! How very, very clever\r\npeople must be to find out things like that!”\r\n\r\nLonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to\r\ncomfort themselves—looking skyward. “It has need to be nearer, for the\r\nnight’s as cold as charity. Don’t seem much warmth from it if it _is_\r\nnearer, all the same.”\r\n\r\n“What is a new star to me?” cried the weeping woman kneeling beside her\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThe schoolboy, rising early for his examination work, puzzled it out\r\nfor himself—with the great white star shining broad and bright through\r\nthe frost-flowers of his window. “Centrifugal, centripetal,” he said,\r\nwith his chin on his fist. “Stop a planet in its flight, rob it of its\r\ncentrifugal force, what then? Centripetal has it, and down it falls\r\ninto the sun! And this—!\r\n\r\n“Do _we_ come in the way? I wonder—”\r\n\r\nThe light of that day went the way of its brethren, and with the later\r\nwatches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again. And it was\r\nnow so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yellow ghost of\r\nitself, hanging huge in the sunset. In a South African City a great man\r\nhad married, and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his\r\nbride. “Even the skies have illuminated,” said the flatterer. Under\r\nCapricorn, two negro lovers, daring the wild beasts and evil spirits,\r\nfor love of one another, crouched together in a cane brake where the\r\nfire-flies hovered. “That is our star,” they whispered, and felt\r\nstrangely comforted by the sweet brilliance of its light.\r\n\r\nThe master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers\r\nfrom him. His calculations were already finished. In a small white\r\nphial there still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake\r\nand active for four long nights. Each day, serene, explicit, patient as\r\never, he had given his lecture to his students, and then had come back\r\nat once to this momentous calculation. His face was grave, a little\r\ndrawn and hectic from his drugged activity. For some time he seemed\r\nlost in thought. Then he went to the window, and the blind went up with\r\na click. Half way up the sky, over the clustering roofs, chimneys and\r\nsteeples of the city, hung the star.\r\n\r\nHe looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy. “You\r\nmay kill me,” he said after a silence. “But I can hold you—and all the\r\nuniverse for that matter—in the grip of this little brain. I would not\r\nchange. Even now.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at the little phial. “There will be no need of sleep again,”\r\nhe said. The next day at noon—punctual to the minute, he entered his\r\nlecture theatre, put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was,\r\nand carefully selected a large piece of chalk. It was a joke among his\r\nstudents that he could not lecture without that piece of chalk to\r\nfumble in his fingers, and once he had been stricken to impotence by\r\ntheir hiding his supply. He came and looked under his grey eyebrows at\r\nthe rising tiers of young fresh faces, and spoke with his accustomed\r\nstudied commonness of phrasing. “Circumstances have\r\narisen—circumstances beyond my control,” he said and paused, “which\r\nwill debar me from completing the course I had designed. It would seem,\r\ngentlemen, if I may put the thing clearly and briefly, that—Man has\r\nlived in vain.”\r\n\r\nThe students glanced at one another. Had they heard aright? Mad? Raised\r\neyebrows and grinning lips there were, but one or two faces remained\r\nintent upon his calm grey-fringed face. “It will be interesting,” he\r\nwas saying, “to devote this morning to an exposition, so far as I can\r\nmake it clear to you, of the calculations that have led me to this\r\nconclusion. Let us assume—”\r\n\r\nHe turned towards the blackboard, meditating a diagram in the way that\r\nwas usual to him. “What was that about ‘lived in vain?’” whispered one\r\nstudent to another. “Listen,” said the other, nodding towards the\r\nlecturer.\r\n\r\nAnd presently they began to understand.\r\n\r\nThat night the star rose later, for its proper eastward motion had\r\ncarried it some way across Leo towards Virgo, and its brightness was so\r\ngreat that the sky became a luminous blue as it rose, and every star\r\nwas hidden in its turn, save only Jupiter near the zenith, Capella,\r\nAldebaran, Sirius and the pointers of the Bear. It was very white and\r\nbeautiful. In many parts of the world that night a pallid halo\r\nencircled it about. It was perceptibly larger; in the clear refractive\r\nsky of the tropics it seemed as if it were nearly a quarter the size of\r\nthe moon. The frost was still on the ground in England, but the world\r\nwas as brightly lit as if it were midsummer moonlight. One could see to\r\nread quite ordinary print by that cold clear light, and in the cities\r\nthe lamps burnt yellow and wan.\r\n\r\nAnd everywhere the world was awake that night, and throughout\r\nChristendom a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the country side\r\nlike the belling of bees in the heather, and this murmurous tumult grew\r\nto a clangour in the cities. It was the tolling of the bells in a\r\nmillion belfry towers and steeples, summoning the people to sleep no\r\nmore, to sin no more, but to gather in their churches and pray. And\r\noverhead, growing larger and brighter as the earth rolled on its way\r\nand the night passed, rose the dazzling star.\r\n\r\nAnd the streets and houses were alight in all the cities, the shipyards\r\nglared, and whatever roads led to high country were lit and crowded all\r\nnight long. And in all the seas about the civilised lands, ships with\r\nthrobbing engines, and ships with bellying sails, crowded with men and\r\nliving creatures, were standing out to ocean and the north. For already\r\nthe warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed all over\r\nthe world, and translated into a hundred tongues. The new planet and\r\nNeptune, locked in a fiery embrace, were whirling headlong, ever faster\r\nand faster towards the sun. Already every second this blazing mass flew\r\na hundred miles, and every second its terrific velocity increased. As\r\nit flew now, indeed, it must pass a hundred million of miles wide of\r\nthe earth and scarcely affect it. But near its destined path, as yet\r\nonly slightly perturbed, spun the mighty planet Jupiter and his moons\r\nsweeping splendid round the sun. Every moment now the attraction\r\nbetween the fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew stronger.\r\nAnd the result of that attraction? Inevitably Jupiter would be\r\ndeflected from its orbit into an elliptical path, and the burning star,\r\nswung by his attraction wide of its sunward rush, would “describe a\r\ncurved path” and perhaps collide with, and certainly pass very close\r\nto, our earth. “Earthquakes, volcanic outbreaks, cyclones, sea waves,\r\nfloods, and a steady rise in temperature to I know not what limit”—so\r\nprophesied the master mathematician.\r\n\r\nAnd overhead, to carry out his words, lonely and cold and livid, blazed\r\nthe star of the coming doom.\r\n\r\nTo many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached, it seemed\r\nthat it was visibly approaching. And that night, too, the weather\r\nchanged, and the frost that had gripped all Central Europe and France\r\nand England softened towards a thaw.\r\n\r\nBut you must not imagine because I have spoken of people praying\r\nthrough the night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing\r\ntoward mountainous country that the whole world was already in a terror\r\nbecause of the star. As a matter of fact, use and wont still ruled the\r\nworld, and save for the talk of idle moments and the splendour of the\r\nnight, nine human beings out of ten were still busy at their common\r\noccupations. In all the cities the shops, save one here and there,\r\nopened and closed at their proper hours, the doctor and the undertaker\r\nplied their trades, the workers gathered in the factories, soldiers\r\ndrilled, scholars studied, lovers sought one another, thieves lurked\r\nand fled, politicians planned their schemes. The presses of the\r\nnewspapers roared through the night, and many a priest of this church\r\nand that would not open his holy building to further what he considered\r\na foolish panic. The newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year\r\n1000—for then, too, people had anticipated the end. The star was no\r\nstar—mere gas—a comet; and were it a star it could not possibly strike\r\nthe earth. There was no precedent for such a thing. Common sense was\r\nsturdy everywhere, scornful, jesting, a little inclined to persecute\r\nthe obdurate fearful. That night, at seven-fifteen by Greenwich time,\r\nthe star would be at its nearest to Jupiter. Then the world would see\r\nthe turn things would take. The master mathematician’s grim warnings\r\nwere treated by many as so much mere elaborate self-advertisement.\r\nCommon sense at last, a little heated by argument, signified its\r\nunalterable convictions by going to bed. So, too, barbarism and\r\nsavagery, already tired of the novelty, went about their nightly\r\nbusiness, and save for a howling dog here and there, the beast world\r\nleft the star unheeded.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, when at last the watchers in the European States saw the star\r\nrise, an hour later it is true, but no larger than it had been the\r\nnight before, there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master\r\nmathematician—to take the danger as if it had passed.\r\n\r\nBut hereafter the laughter ceased. The star grew—it grew with a\r\nterrible steadiness hour after hour, a little larger each hour, a\r\nlittle nearer the midnight zenith, and brighter and brighter, until it\r\nhad turned night into a second day. Had it come straight to the earth\r\ninstead of in a curved path, had it lost no velocity to Jupiter, it\r\nmust have leapt the intervening gulf in a day, but as it was it took\r\nfive days altogether to come by our planet. The next night it had\r\nbecome a third the size of the moon before it set to English eyes, and\r\nthe thaw was assured. It rose over America near the size of the moon,\r\nbut blinding white to look at, and _hot_; and a breath of hot wind blew\r\nnow with its rising and gathering strength, and in Virginia, and\r\nBrazil, and down the St. Lawrence valley, it shone intermittently\r\nthrough a driving reek of thunder-clouds, flickering violet lightning,\r\nand hail unprecedented. In Manitoba was a thaw and devastating floods.\r\nAnd upon all the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to melt\r\nthat night, and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed thick\r\nand turbid, and soon—in their upper reaches—with swirling trees and the\r\nbodies of beasts and men. They rose steadily, steadily in the ghostly\r\nbrilliance, and came trickling over their banks at last, behind the\r\nflying population of their valleys.\r\n\r\nAnd along the coast of Argentina and up the South Atlantic the tides\r\nwere higher than had ever been in the memory of man, and the storms\r\ndrove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland, drowning whole\r\ncities. And so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of\r\nthe sun was like the coming of a shadow. The earthquakes began and grew\r\nuntil all down America from the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn, hillsides\r\nwere sliding, fissures were opening, and houses and walls crumbling to\r\ndestruction. The whole side of Cotopaxi slipped out in one vast\r\nconvulsion, and a tumult of lava poured out so high and broad and swift\r\nand liquid that in one day it reached the sea.\r\n\r\nSo the star, with the wan moon in its wake, marched across the Pacific,\r\ntrailed the thunderstorms like the hem of a robe, and the growing tidal\r\nwave that toiled behind it, frothing and eager, poured over island and\r\nisland and swept them clear of men. Until that wave came at last—in a\r\nblinding light and with the breath of a furnace, swift and terrible it\r\ncame—a wall of water, fifty feet high, roaring hungrily, upon the long\r\ncoasts of Asia, and swept inland across the plains of China. For a\r\nspace the star, hotter now and larger and brighter than the sun in its\r\nstrength, showed with pitiless brilliance the wide and populous\r\ncountry; towns and villages with their pagodas and trees, roads, wide\r\ncultivated fields, millions of sleepless people staring in helpless\r\nterror at the incandescent sky; and then, low and growing, came the\r\nmurmur of the flood. And thus it was with millions of men that night—a\r\nflight nowhither, with limbs heavy with heat and breath fierce and\r\nscant, and the flood like a wall swift and white behind. And then\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nChina was lit glowing white, but over Japan and Java and all the\r\nislands of Eastern Asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire\r\nbecause of the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting\r\nforth to salute its coming. Above was the lava, hot gases and ash, and\r\nbelow the seething floods, and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with\r\nthe earthquake shocks. Soon the immemorial snows of Thibet and the\r\nHimalaya were melting and pouring down by ten million deepening\r\nconverging channels upon the plains of Burmah and Hindostan. The\r\ntangled summits of the Indian jungles were aflame in a thousand places,\r\nand below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that\r\nstill struggled feebly and reflected the blood-red tongues of fire. And\r\nin a rudderless confusion a multitude of men and women fled down the\r\nbroad river-ways to that one last hope of men—the open sea.\r\n\r\nLarger grew the star, and larger, hotter, and brighter with a terrible\r\nswiftness now. The tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence, and the\r\nwhirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that\r\nplunged incessantly, speckled with storm-tossed ships.\r\n\r\nAnd then came a wonder. It seemed to those who in Europe watched for\r\nthe rising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation. In\r\na thousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled\r\nthither from the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of\r\nhill watched for that rising in vain. Hour followed hour through a\r\nterrible suspense, and the star rose not. Once again men set their eyes\r\nupon the old constellations they had counted lost to them forever. In\r\nEngland it was hot and clear overhead, though the ground quivered\r\nperpetually, but in the tropics, Sirius and Capella and Aldebaran\r\nshowed through a veil of steam. And when at last the great star rose\r\nnear ten hours late, the sun rose close upon it, and in the centre of\r\nits white heart was a disc of black.\r\n\r\nOver Asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the\r\nsky, and then suddenly, as it hung over India, its light had been\r\nveiled. All the plain of India from the mouth of the Indus to the\r\nmouths of the Ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that night,\r\nout of which rose temples and palaces, mounds and hills, black with\r\npeople. Every minaret was a clustering mass of people, who fell one by\r\none into the turbid waters, as heat and terror overcame them. The whole\r\nland seemed a-wailing and suddenly there swept a shadow across that\r\nfurnace of despair, and a breath of cold wind, and a gathering of\r\nclouds, out of the cooling air. Men looking up, near blinded, at the\r\nstar, saw that a black disc was creeping across the light. It was the\r\nmoon, coming between the star and the earth. And even as men cried to\r\nGod at this respite, out of the East with a strange inexplicable\r\nswiftness sprang the sun. And then star, sun and moon rushed together\r\nacross the heavens.\r\n\r\nSo it was that presently, to the European watchers, star and sun rose\r\nclose upon each other, drove headlong for a space and then slower, and\r\nat last came to rest, star and sun merged into one glare of flame at\r\nthe zenith of the sky. The moon no longer eclipsed the star but was\r\nlost to sight in the brilliance of the sky. And though those who were\r\nstill alive regarded it for the most part with that dull stupidity that\r\nhunger, fatigue, heat and despair engender, there were still men who\r\ncould perceive the meaning of these signs. Star and earth had been at\r\ntheir nearest, had swung about one another, and the star had passed.\r\nAlready it was receding, swifter and swifter, in the last stage of its\r\nheadlong journey downward into the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd then the clouds gathered, blotting out the vision of the sky, the\r\nthunder and lightning wove a garment round the world; all over the\r\nearth was such a downpour of rain as men had never before seen, and\r\nwhere the volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy there descended\r\ntorrents of mud. Everywhere the waters were pouring off the land,\r\nleaving mud-silted ruins, and the earth littered like a storm-worn\r\nbeach with all that had floated, and the dead bodies of the men and\r\nbrutes, its children. For days the water streamed off the land,\r\nsweeping away soil and trees and houses in the way, and piling huge\r\ndykes and scooping out Titanic gullies over the country side. Those\r\nwere the days of darkness that followed the star and the heat. All\r\nthrough them, and for many weeks and months, the earthquakes continued.\r\n\r\nBut the star had passed, and men, hunger-driven and gathering courage\r\nonly slowly, might creep back to their ruined cities, buried granaries,\r\nand sodden fields. Such few ships as had escaped the storms of that\r\ntime came stunned and shattered and sounding their way cautiously\r\nthrough the new marks and shoals of once familiar ports. And as the\r\nstorms subsided men perceived that everywhere the days were hotter than\r\nof yore, and the sun larger, and the moon, shrunk to a third of its\r\nformer size, took now fourscore days between its new and new.\r\n\r\nBut of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men, of the saving\r\nof laws and books and machines, of the strange change that had come\r\nover Iceland and Greenland and the shores of Baffin’s Bay, so that the\r\nsailors coming there presently found them green and gracious, and could\r\nscarce believe their eyes, this story does not tell. Nor of the\r\nmovement of mankind now that the earth was hotter, northward and\r\nsouthward towards the poles of the earth. It concerns itself only with\r\nthe coming and the passing of the Star.\r\n\r\nThe Martian astronomers—for there are astronomers on Mars, although\r\nthey are very different beings from men—were naturally profoundly\r\ninterested by these things. They saw them from their own standpoint of\r\ncourse. “Considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was\r\nflung through our solar system into the sun,” one wrote, “it is\r\nastonishing what a little damage the earth, which it missed so\r\nnarrowly, has sustained. All the familiar continental markings and the\r\nmasses of the seas remain intact, and indeed the only difference seems\r\nto be a shrinkage of the white discoloration (supposed to be frozen\r\nwater) round either pole.” Which only shows how small the vastest of\r\nhuman catastrophes may seem, at a distance of a few million miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DREAM OF ARMAGEDDON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man with the white face entered the carriage at Rugby. He moved\r\nslowly in spite of the urgency of his porter, and even while he was\r\nstill on the platform I noted how ill he seemed. He dropped into the\r\ncorner over against me with a sigh, made an incomplete attempt to\r\narrange his travelling shawl, and became motionless, with his eyes\r\nstaring vacantly. Presently he was moved by a sense of my observation,\r\nlooked up at me, and put out a spiritless hand for his newspaper. Then\r\nhe glanced again in my direction.\r\n\r\nI feigned to read. I feared I had unwittingly embarrassed him, and in a\r\nmoment I was surprised to find him speaking.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon?” said I.\r\n\r\n“That book,” he repeated, pointing a lean finger, “is about dreams.”\r\n\r\n“Obviously,” I answered, for it was Fortnum Roscoe’s Dream States, and\r\nthe title was on the cover.\r\n\r\nHe hung silent for a space as if he sought words. “Yes,” he said at\r\nlast, “but they tell you nothing.”\r\n\r\nI did not catch his meaning for a second.\r\n\r\n“They don’t know,” he added.\r\n\r\nI looked a little more attentively at his face.\r\n\r\n“There are dreams,” he said, “and dreams.”\r\n\r\nThat sort of proposition I never dispute.\r\n\r\n“I suppose—” he hesitated. “Do you ever dream? I mean vividly.”\r\n\r\n“I dream very little,” I answered. “I doubt if I have three vivid\r\ndreams in a year.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he said, and seemed for a moment to collect his thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Your dreams don’t mix with your memories?” he asked abruptly. “You\r\ndon’t find yourself in doubt; did this happen or did it not?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly ever. Except just for a momentary hesitation now and then. I\r\nsuppose few people do.”\r\n\r\n“Does he say—?” He indicated the book.\r\n\r\n“Says it happens at times and gives the usual explanation about\r\nintensity of impression and the like to account for its not happening\r\nas a rule. I suppose you know something of these theories—”\r\n\r\n“Very little—except that they are wrong.”\r\n\r\nHis emaciated hand played with the strap of the window for a time. I\r\nprepared to resume reading, and that seemed to precipitate his next\r\nremark. He leant forward almost as though he would touch me.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t there something called consecutive dreaming—that goes on night\r\nafter night?”\r\n\r\n“I believe there is. There are cases given in most books on mental\r\ntrouble.”\r\n\r\n“Mental trouble! Yes. I daresay there are. It’s the right place for\r\nthem. But what I mean—” He looked at his bony knuckles. “Is that sort\r\nof thing always dreaming? Is it dreaming? Or is it something else?\r\nMightn’t it be something else?”\r\n\r\nI should have snubbed his persistent conversation but for the drawn\r\nanxiety of his face. I remember now the look of his faded eyes and the\r\nlids red stained—perhaps you know that look.\r\n\r\n“I’m not just arguing about a matter of opinion,” he said. “The thing’s\r\nkilling me.”\r\n\r\n“Dreams?”\r\n\r\n“If you call them dreams. Night after night. Vivid!—so vivid . . . .\r\nthis—” (he indicated the landscape that went streaming by the window)\r\n“seems unreal in comparison! I can scarcely remember who I am, what\r\nbusiness I am on . . . .”\r\n\r\nHe paused. “Even now—”\r\n\r\n“The dream is always the same—do you mean?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It’s over.”\r\n\r\n“You mean?”\r\n\r\n“I died.”\r\n\r\n“Died?”\r\n\r\n“Smashed and killed, and now, so much of me as that dream was, is dead.\r\nDead forever. I dreamt I was another man, you know, living in a\r\ndifferent part of the world and in a different time. I dreamt that\r\nnight after night. Night after night I woke into that other life. Fresh\r\nscenes and fresh happenings—until I came upon the last—”\r\n\r\n“When you died?”\r\n\r\n“When I died.”\r\n\r\n“And since then—”\r\n\r\n“No,” he said. “Thank God! That was the end of the dream . . .”\r\n\r\nIt was clear I was in for this dream. And after all, I had an hour\r\nbefore me, the light was fading fast, and Fortnum Roscoe has a dreary\r\nway with him. “Living in a different time,” I said: “do you mean in\r\nsome different age?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Past?”\r\n\r\n“No, to come—to come.”\r\n\r\n“The year three thousand, for example?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what year it was. I did when I was asleep, when I was\r\ndreaming, that is, but not now—not now that I am awake. There’s a lot\r\nof things I have forgotten since I woke out of these dreams, though I\r\nknew them at the time when I was—I suppose it was dreaming. They called\r\nthe year differently from our way of calling the year . . . What did\r\nthey call it?” He put his hand to his forehead. “No,” said he, “I\r\nforget.”\r\n\r\nHe sat smiling weakly. For a moment I feared he did not mean to tell me\r\nhis dream. As a rule I hate people who tell their dreams, but this\r\nstruck me differently. I proffered assistance even. “It began—” I\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n“It was vivid from the first. I seemed to wake up in it suddenly. And\r\nit’s curious that in these dreams I am speaking of I never remembered\r\nthis life I am living now. It seemed as if the dream life was enough\r\nwhile it lasted. Perhaps—But I will tell you how I find myself when I\r\ndo my best to recall it all. I don’t remember anything clearly until I\r\nfound myself sitting in a sort of loggia looking out over the sea. I\r\nhad been dozing, and suddenly I woke up—fresh and vivid—not a bit\r\ndreamlike—because the girl had stopped fanning me.”\r\n\r\n“The girl?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the girl. You must not interrupt or you will put me out.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly. “You won’t think I’m mad?” he said.\r\n\r\n“No,” I answered. “You’ve been dreaming. Tell me your dream.”\r\n\r\n“I woke up, I say, because the girl had stopped fanning me. I was not\r\nsurprised to find myself there or anything of that sort, you\r\nunderstand. I did not feel I had fallen into it suddenly. I simply took\r\nit up at that point. Whatever memory I had of this life, this\r\nnineteenth-century life, faded as I woke, vanished like a dream. I knew\r\nall about myself, knew that my name was no longer Cooper but Hedon, and\r\nall about my position in the world. I’ve forgotten a lot since I\r\nwoke—there’s a want of connection—but it was all quite clear and matter\r\nof fact then.”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated again, gripping the window strap, putting his face forward\r\nand looking up to me appealingly.\r\n\r\n“This seems bosh to you?”\r\n\r\n“No, no!” I cried. “Go on. Tell me what this loggia was like!”\r\n\r\n“It was not really a loggia—I don’t know what to call it. It faced\r\nsouth. It was small. It was all in shadow except the semicircle above\r\nthe balcony that showed the sky and sea and the corner where the girl\r\nstood. I was on a couch—it was a metal couch with light striped\r\ncushions—and the girl was leaning over the balcony with her back to me.\r\nThe light of the sunrise fell on her ear and cheek. Her pretty white\r\nneck and the little curls that nestled there, and her white shoulder\r\nwere in the sun, and all the grace of her body was in the cool blue\r\nshadow. She was dressed—how can I describe it? It was easy and flowing.\r\nAnd altogether there she stood, so that it came to me how beautiful and\r\ndesirable she was, as though I had never seen her before. And when at\r\nlast I sighed and raised myself upon my arm she turned her face to me—”\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\r\n“I have lived three-and-fifty years in this world. I have had mother,\r\nsisters, friends, wife and daughters—all their faces, the play of their\r\nfaces, I know. But the face of this girl—it is much more real to me. I\r\ncan bring it back into memory so that I see it again—I could draw it or\r\npaint it. And after all—”\r\n\r\nHe stopped—but I said nothing.\r\n\r\n“The face of a dream—the face of a dream. She was beautiful. Not that\r\nbeauty which is terrible, cold, and worshipful, like the beauty of a\r\nsaint; nor that beauty that stirs fierce passions; but a sort of\r\nradiation, sweet lips that softened into smiles, and grave gray eyes.\r\nAnd she moved gracefully, she seemed to have part with all pleasant and\r\ngracious things—”\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and his face was downcast and hidden. Then he looked up at\r\nme and went on, making no further attempt to disguise his absolute\r\nbelief in the reality of his story.\r\n\r\n“You see, I had thrown up my plans and ambitions, thrown up all I had\r\never worked for or desired for her sake. I had been a master man away\r\nthere in the north, with influence and property and a great reputation,\r\nbut none of it had seemed worth having beside her. I had come to the\r\nplace, this city of sunny pleasures with her, and left all those things\r\nto wreck and ruin just to save a remnant at least of my life. While I\r\nhad been in love with her before I knew that she had any care for me,\r\nbefore I had imagined that she would dare—that we should dare, all my\r\nlife had seemed vain and hollow, dust and ashes. It was dust and ashes.\r\nNight after night and through the long days I had longed and desired—my\r\nsoul had beaten against the thing forbidden!\r\n\r\n“But it is impossible for one man to tell another just these things.\r\nIt’s emotion, it’s a tint, a light that comes and goes. Only while it’s\r\nthere, everything changes, everything. The thing is I came away and\r\nleft them in their Crisis to do what they could.”\r\n\r\n“Left whom?” I asked, puzzled.\r\n\r\n“The people up in the north there. You see—in this dream, anyhow—I had\r\nbeen a big man, the sort of man men come to trust in, to group\r\nthemselves about. Millions of men who had never seen me were ready to\r\ndo things and risk things because of their confidence in me. I had been\r\nplaying that game for years, that big laborious game, that vague,\r\nmonstrous political game amidst intrigues and betrayals, speech and\r\nagitation. It was a vast weltering world, and at last I had a sort of\r\nleadership against the Gang—you know it was called the Gang—a sort of\r\ncompromise of scoundrelly projects and base ambitions and vast public\r\nemotional stupidities and catch-words—the Gang that kept the world\r\nnoisy and blind year by year, and all the while that it was drifting,\r\ndrifting towards infinite disaster. But I can’t expect you to\r\nunderstand the shades and complications of the year—the year something\r\nor other ahead. I had it all—down to the smallest details—in my dream.\r\nI suppose I had been dreaming of it before I awoke, and the fading\r\noutline of some queer new development I had imagined still hung about\r\nme as I rubbed my eyes. It was some grubby affair that made me thank\r\nGod for the sunlight. I sat up on the couch and remained looking at the\r\nwoman and rejoicing—rejoicing that I had come away out of all that\r\ntumult and folly and violence before it was too late. After all, I\r\nthought, this is life—love and beauty, desire and delight, are they not\r\nworth all those dismal struggles for vague, gigantic ends? And I blamed\r\nmyself for having ever sought to be a leader when I might have given my\r\ndays to love. But then, thought I, if I had not spent my early days\r\nsternly and austerely, I might have wasted myself upon vain and\r\nworthless women, and at the thought all my being went out in love and\r\ntenderness to my dear mistress, my dear lady, who had come at last and\r\ncompelled me—compelled me by her invincible charm for me—to lay that\r\nlife aside.\r\n\r\n“‘You are worth it,’ I said, speaking without intending her to hear;\r\n‘you are worth it, my dearest one; worth pride and praise and all\r\nthings. Love! to have you is worth them all together.’ And at the\r\nmurmur of my voice she turned about.\r\n\r\n“‘Come and see,’ she cried—I can hear her now—‘come and see the sunrise\r\nupon Monte Solaro.’\r\n\r\n“I remember how I sprang to my feet and joined her at the balcony. She\r\nput a white hand upon my shoulder and pointed towards great masses of\r\nlimestone, flushing, as it were, into life. I looked. But first I noted\r\nthe sunlight on her face caressing the lines of her cheeks and neck.\r\nHow can I describe to you the scene we had before us? We were at\r\nCapri—”\r\n\r\n“I have been there,” I said. “I have clambered up Monte Solaro and\r\ndrunk vero Capri—muddy stuff like cider—at the summit.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the man with the white face; “then perhaps you can tell\r\nme—you will know if this is indeed Capri. For in this life I have never\r\nbeen there. Let me describe it. We were in a little room, one of a vast\r\nmultitude of little rooms, very cool and sunny, hollowed out of the\r\nlimestone of a sort of cape, very high above the sea. The whole island,\r\nyou know, was one enormous hotel, complex beyond explaining, and on the\r\nother side there were miles of floating hotels, and huge floating\r\nstages to which the flying machines came. They called it a pleasure\r\ncity. Of course, there was none of that in your time—rather, I should\r\nsay, is none of that now. Of course. Now!—yes.\r\n\r\n“Well, this room of ours was at the extremity of the cape, so that one\r\ncould see east and west. Eastward was a great cliff—a thousand feet\r\nhigh perhaps—coldly gray except for one bright edge of gold, and beyond\r\nit the Isle of the Sirens, and a falling coast that faded and passed\r\ninto the hot sunrise. And when one turned to the west, distinct and\r\nnear was a little bay, a little beach still in shadow. And out of that\r\nshadow rose Solaro straight and tall, flushed and golden crested, like\r\na beauty throned, and the white moon was floating behind her in the\r\nsky. And before us from east to west stretched the many-tinted sea all\r\ndotted with little sailing boats.\r\n\r\n“To the eastward, of course, these little boats were gray and very\r\nminute and clear, but to the westward they were little boats of\r\ngold—shining gold—almost like little flames. And just below us was a\r\nrock with an arch worn through it. The blue sea-water broke to green\r\nand foam all round the rock, and a galley came gliding out of the\r\narch.”\r\n\r\n“I know that rock.” I said. “I was nearly drowned there. It is called\r\nthe Faraglioni.”\r\n\r\n“I Faraglioni? Yes, she called it that,” answered the man with the\r\nwhite face. “There was some story—but that—”\r\n\r\nHe put his hand to his forehead again. “No,” he said, “I forget that\r\nstory.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that is the first thing I remember, the first dream I had, that\r\nlittle shaded room and the beautiful air and sky and that dear lady of\r\nmine, with her shining arms and her graceful robe, and how we sat and\r\ntalked in half whispers to one another. We talked in whispers not\r\nbecause there was any one to hear, but because there was still such a\r\nfreshness of mind between us that our thoughts were a little\r\nfrightened, I think, to find themselves at last in words. And so they\r\nwent softly.\r\n\r\n“Presently we were hungry and we went from our apartment, going by a\r\nstrange passage with a moving floor, until we came to the great\r\nbreakfast room—there was a fountain and music. A pleasant and joyful\r\nplace it was, with its sunlight and splashing, and the murmur of\r\nplucked strings. And we sat and ate and smiled at one another, and I\r\nwould not heed a man who was watching me from a table near by.\r\n\r\n“And afterwards we went on to the dancing-hall. But I cannot describe\r\nthat hall. The place was enormous—larger than any building you have\r\never seen—and in one place there was the old gate of Capri, caught into\r\nthe wall of a gallery high overhead. Light girders, stems and threads\r\nof gold, burst from the pillars like fountains, streamed like an Aurora\r\nacross the roof and interlaced, like—like conjuring tricks. All about\r\nthe great circle for the dancers there were beautiful figures, strange\r\ndragons, and intricate and wonderful grotesques bearing lights. The\r\nplace was inundated with artificial light that shamed the newborn day.\r\nAnd as we went through the throng the people turned about and looked at\r\nus, for all through the world my name and face were known, and how I\r\nhad suddenly thrown up pride and struggle to come to this place. And\r\nthey looked also at the lady beside me, though half the story of how at\r\nlast she had come to me was unknown or mistold. And few of the men who\r\nwere there, I know, but judged me a happy man, in spite of all the\r\nshame and dishonour that had come upon my name.\r\n\r\n“The air was full of music, full of harmonious scents, full of the\r\nrhythm of beautiful motions. Thousands of beautiful people swarmed\r\nabout the hall, crowded the galleries, sat in a myriad recesses; they\r\nwere dressed in splendid colours and crowned with flowers; thousands\r\ndanced about the great circle beneath the white images of the ancient\r\ngods, and glorious processions of youths and maidens came and went. We\r\ntwo danced, not the dreary monotonies of your days—of this time, I\r\nmean—but dances that were beautiful, intoxicating. And even now I can\r\nsee my lady dancing—dancing joyously. She danced, you know, with a\r\nserious face; she danced with a serious dignity, and yet she was\r\nsmiling at me and caressing me—smiling and caressing with her eyes.\r\n\r\n“The music was different,” he murmured. “It went—I cannot describe it;\r\nbut it was infinitely richer and more varied than any music that has\r\never come to me awake.\r\n\r\n“And then—it was when we had done dancing—a man came to speak to me. He\r\nwas a lean, resolute man, very soberly clad for that place, and already\r\nI had marked his face watching me in the breakfasting hall, and\r\nafterwards as we went along the passage I had avoided his eye. But now,\r\nas we sat in a little alcove, smiling at the pleasure of all the people\r\nwho went to and fro across the shining floor, he came and touched me,\r\nand spoke to me so that I was forced to listen. And he asked that he\r\nmight speak to me for a little time apart.\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ I said. ‘I have no secrets from this lady. What do you want to\r\ntell me?’\r\n\r\n“He said it was a trivial matter, or at least a dry matter, for a lady\r\nto hear.\r\n\r\n“‘Perhaps for me to hear,’ said I.\r\n\r\n“He glanced at her, as though almost he would appeal to her. Then he\r\nasked me suddenly if I had heard of a great and avenging declaration\r\nthat Evesham had made? Now, Evesham had always before been the man next\r\nto myself in the leadership of that great party in the north. He was a\r\nforcible, hard, and tactless man, and only I had been able to control\r\nand soften him. It was on his account even more than my own, I think,\r\nthat the others had been so dismayed at my retreat. So this question\r\nabout what he had done reawakened my old interest in the life I had put\r\naside just for a moment.\r\n\r\n“‘I have taken no heed of any news for many days,’ I said. What has\r\nEvesham been saying?’\r\n\r\n“And with that the man began, nothing loth, and I must confess even I\r\nwas struck by Evesham’s reckless folly in the wild and threatening\r\nwords he had used. And this messenger they had sent to me not only told\r\nme of Evesham’s speech, but went on to ask counsel and to point out\r\nwhat need they had of me. While he talked, my lady sat a little forward\r\nand watched his face and mine.\r\n\r\n“My old habits of scheming and organising reasserted themselves. I\r\ncould even see myself suddenly returning to the north, and all the\r\ndramatic effect of it. All that this man said witnessed to the disorder\r\nof the party indeed, but not to its damage. I should go back stronger\r\nthan I had come. And then I thought of my lady. You see—how can I tell\r\nyou? There were certain peculiarities of our relationship—as things are\r\nI need not tell you about that—which would render her presence with me\r\nimpossible. I should have had to leave her; indeed, I should have had\r\nto renounce her clearly and openly, if I was to do all that I could do\r\nin the north. And the man knew that, even as he talked to her and me,\r\nknew it as well as she did, that my steps to duty were—first,\r\nseparation, then abandonment. At the touch of that thought my dream of\r\na return was shattered. I turned on the man suddenly, as he was\r\nimagining his eloquence was gaining ground with me.\r\n\r\n“‘What have I to do with these things now?’ I said. ‘I have done with\r\nthem. Do you think I am coquetting with your people in coming here?’\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ he said. ‘But—’\r\n\r\n“‘Why cannot you leave me alone. I have done with these things. I have\r\nceased to be anything but a private man.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ he answered. ‘But have you thought?—this talk of war, these\r\nreckless challenges, these wild aggressions—’\r\n\r\n“I stood up.\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ I cried. ‘I won’t hear you. I took count of all those things, I\r\nweighed them—and I have come away.’\r\n\r\n“He seemed to consider the possibility of persistence. He looked from\r\nme to where the lady sat regarding us.\r\n\r\n“‘War,’ he said, as if he were speaking to himself, and then turned\r\nslowly from me and walked away.\r\n\r\n“I stood, caught in the whirl of thoughts his appeal had set going.\r\n\r\n“I heard my lady’s voice.\r\n\r\n“‘Dear,’ she said; ‘but if they had need of you—’\r\n\r\n“She did not finish her sentence, she let it rest there. I turned to\r\nher sweet face, and the balance of my mood swayed and reeled.\r\n\r\n“‘They want me only to do the thing they dare not do themselves,’ I\r\nsaid. ‘If they distrust Evesham they must settle with him themselves.’\r\n\r\n“She looked at me doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“‘But war—’ she said.\r\n\r\n“I saw a doubt on her face that I had seen before, a doubt of herself\r\nand me, the first shadow of the discovery that, seen strongly and\r\ncompletely, must drive us apart for ever.\r\n\r\n“Now, I was an older mind than hers, and I could sway her to this\r\nbelief or that.\r\n\r\n“‘My dear one,’ I said, ‘you must not trouble over these things. There\r\nwill be no war. Certainly there will be no war. The age of wars is\r\npast. Trust me to know the justice of this case. They have no right\r\nupon me, dearest, and no one has a right upon me. I have been free to\r\nchoose my life, and I have chosen this.’\r\n\r\n“‘But war—,’ she said.\r\n\r\n“I sat down beside her. I put an arm behind her and took her hand in\r\nmine. I set myself to drive that doubt away—I set myself to fill her\r\nmind with pleasant things again. I lied to her, and in lying to her I\r\nlied also to myself. And she was only too ready to believe me, only too\r\nready to forget.\r\n\r\n“Very soon the shadow had gone again, and we were hastening to our\r\nbathing-place in the Grotta del Bovo Marino, where it was our custom to\r\nbathe every day. We swam and splashed one another, and in that buoyant\r\nwater I seemed to become something lighter and stronger than a man. And\r\nat last we came out dripping and rejoicing and raced among the rocks.\r\nAnd then I put on a dry bathing-dress, and we sat to bask in the sun,\r\nand presently I nodded, resting my head against her knee, and she put\r\nher hand upon my hair and stroked it softly and I dozed. And behold! as\r\nit were with the snapping of the string of a violin, I was awakening,\r\nand I was in my own bed in Liverpool, in the life of to-day.\r\n\r\n“Only for a time I could not believe that all these vivid moments had\r\nbeen no more than the substance of a dream.\r\n\r\n“In truth, I could not believe it a dream for all the sobering reality\r\nof things about me. I bathed and dressed as it were by habit, and as I\r\nshaved I argued why I of all men should leave the woman I loved to go\r\nback to fantastic politics in the hard and strenuous north. Even if\r\nEvesham did force the world back to war, what was that to me? I was a\r\nman with the heart of a man, and why should I feel the responsibility\r\nof a deity for the way the world might go?\r\n\r\n“You know that is not quite the way I think about affairs, about my\r\nreal affairs. I am a solicitor, you know, with a point of view.\r\n\r\n“The vision was so real, you must understand, so utterly unlike a dream\r\nthat I kept perpetually recalling little irrelevant details; even the\r\nornament of the book-cover that lay on my wife’s sewing-machine in the\r\nbreakfast-room recalled with the utmost vividness the gilt line that\r\nran about the seat in the alcove where I had talked with the messenger\r\nfrom my deserted party. Have you ever heard of a dream that had a\r\nquality like that?”\r\n\r\n“Like—?”\r\n\r\n“So that afterwards you remembered little details you had forgotten.”\r\n\r\nI thought. I had never noticed the point before, but he was right.\r\n\r\n“Never,” I said. “That is what you never seem to do with dreams.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered. “But that is just what I did. I am a solicitor, you\r\nmust understand, in Liverpool, and I could not help wondering what the\r\nclients and business people I found myself talking to in my office\r\nwould think if I told them suddenly I was in love with a girl who would\r\nbe born a couple of hundred years or so hence, and worried about the\r\npolitics of my great-great-great-grandchildren. I was chiefly busy that\r\nday negotiating a ninety-nine-year building lease. It was a private\r\nbuilder in a hurry, and we wanted to tie him in every possible way. I\r\nhad an interview with him, and he showed a certain want of temper that\r\nsent me to bed still irritated. That night I had no dream. Nor did I\r\ndream the next night, at least, to remember.\r\n\r\n“Something of that intense reality of conviction vanished. I began to\r\nfeel sure it was a dream. And then it came again.\r\n\r\n“When the dream came again, nearly four days later, it was very\r\ndifferent. I think it certain that four days had also elapsed in the\r\ndream. Many things had happened in the north, and the shadow of them\r\nwas back again between us, and this time it was not so easily\r\ndispelled. I began I know with moody musings. Why, in spite of all,\r\nshould I go back, go back for all the rest of my days to toil and\r\nstress, insults and perpetual dissatisfaction, simply to save hundreds\r\nof millions of common people, whom I did not love, whom too often I\r\ncould do no other than despise, from the stress and anguish of war and\r\ninfinite misrule? And after all I might fail. They all sought their own\r\nnarrow ends, and why should not I—why should not I also live as a man?\r\nAnd out of such thoughts her voice summoned me, and I lifted my eyes.\r\n\r\n“I found myself awake and walking. We had come out above the Pleasure\r\nCity, we were near the summit of Monte Solaro and looking towards the\r\nbay. It was the late afternoon and very clear. Far away to the left\r\nIschia hung in a golden haze between sea and sky, and Naples was coldly\r\nwhite against the hills, and before us was Vesuvius with a tall and\r\nslender streamer feathering at last towards the south, and the ruins of\r\nTorre dell’ Annunziata and Castellammare glittering and near.”\r\n\r\nI interrupted suddenly: “You have been to Capri, of course?”\r\n\r\n“Only in this dream,” he said, “only in this dream. All across the bay\r\nbeyond Sorrento were the floating palaces of the Pleasure City moored\r\nand chained. And northward were the broad floating stages that received\r\nthe aeroplanes. Aeroplanes fell out of the sky every afternoon, each\r\nbringing its thousands of pleasure-seekers from the uttermost parts of\r\nthe earth to Capri and its delights. All these things, I say, stretched\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n“But we noticed them only incidentally because of an unusual sight that\r\nevening had to show. Five war aeroplanes that had long slumbered\r\nuseless in the distant arsenals of the Rhinemouth were manoeuvring now\r\nin the eastward sky. Evesham had astonished the world by producing them\r\nand others, and sending them to circle here and there. It was the\r\nthreat material in the great game of bluff he was playing, and it had\r\ntaken even me by surprise. He was one of those incredibly stupid\r\nenergetic people who seem sent by heaven to create disasters. His\r\nenergy to the first glance seemed so wonderfully like capacity! But he\r\nhad no imagination, no invention, only a stupid, vast, driving force of\r\nwill, and a mad faith in his stupid idiot ‘luck’ to pull him through. I\r\nremember how we stood upon the headland watching the squadron circling\r\nfar away, and how I weighed the full meaning of the sight, seeing\r\nclearly the way things must go. And then even it was not too late. I\r\nmight have gone back, I think, and saved the world. The people of the\r\nnorth would follow me, I knew, granted only that in one thing I\r\nrespected their moral standards. The east and south would trust me as\r\nthey would trust no other northern man. And I knew I had only to put it\r\nto her and she would have let me go . . . . Not because she did not\r\nlove me!\r\n\r\n“Only I did not want to go; my will was all the other way about. I had\r\nso newly thrown off the incubus of responsibility: I was still so fresh\r\na renegade from duty that the daylight clearness of what I ought to do\r\nhad no power at all to touch my will. My will was to live, to gather\r\npleasures and make my dear lady happy. But though this sense of vast\r\nneglected duties had no power to draw me, it could make me silent and\r\npreoccupied, it robbed the days I had spent of half their brightness\r\nand roused me into dark meditations in the silence of the night. And as\r\nI stood and watched Evesham’s aeroplanes sweep to and fro—those birds\r\nof infinite ill omen—she stood beside me watching me, perceiving the\r\ntrouble indeed, but not perceiving it clearly—her eyes questioning my\r\nface, her expression shaded with perplexity. Her face was gray because\r\nthe sunset was fading out of the sky. It was no fault of hers that she\r\nheld me. She had asked me to go from her, and again in the night time\r\nand with tears she had asked me to go.\r\n\r\n“At last it was the sense of her that roused me from my mood. I turned\r\nupon her suddenly and challenged her to race down the mountain slopes.\r\n‘No,’ she said, as if I had jarred with her gravity, but I was resolved\r\nto end that gravity, and make her run—no one can be very gray and sad\r\nwho is out of breath—and when she stumbled I ran with my hand beneath\r\nher arm. We ran down past a couple of men, who turned back staring in\r\nastonishment at my behaviour—they must have recognised my face. And\r\nhalf way down the slope came a tumult in the air, clang-clank,\r\nclang-clank, and we stopped, and presently over the hill-crest those\r\nwar things came flying one behind the other.”\r\n\r\nThe man seemed hesitating on the verge of a description.\r\n\r\n“What were they like?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“They had never fought,” he said. “They were just like our ironclads\r\nare nowadays; they had never fought. No one knew what they might do,\r\nwith excited men inside them; few even cared to speculate. They were\r\ngreat driving things shaped like spear-heads without a shaft, with a\r\npropeller in the place of the shaft.”\r\n\r\n“Steel?”\r\n\r\n“Not steel.”\r\n\r\n“Aluminum?”\r\n\r\n“No, no, nothing of that sort. An alloy that was very common—as common\r\nas brass, for example. It was called—let me see—” He squeezed his\r\nforehead with the fingers of one hand. “I am forgetting everything,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“And they carried guns?”\r\n\r\n“Little guns, firing high explosive shells. They fired the guns\r\nbackwards, out of the base of the leaf, so to speak, and rammed with\r\nthe beak. That was the theory, you know, but they had never been\r\nfought. No one could tell exactly what was going to happen. And\r\nmeanwhile I suppose it was very fine to go whirling through the air\r\nlike a flight of young swallows, swift and easy. I guess the captains\r\ntried not to think too clearly what the real thing would be like. And\r\nthese flying war machines, you know, were only one sort of the endless\r\nwar contrivances that had been invented and had fallen into abeyance\r\nduring the long peace. There were all sorts of these things that people\r\nwere routing out and furbishing up; infernal things, silly things;\r\nthings that had never been tried; big engines, terrible explosives,\r\ngreat guns. You know the silly way of these ingenious sort of men who\r\nmake these things; they turn ‘em out as beavers build dams, and with no\r\nmore sense of the rivers they’re going to divert and the lands they’re\r\ngoing to flood!\r\n\r\n“As we went down the winding stepway to our hotel again, in the\r\ntwilight, I foresaw it all: I saw how clearly and inevitably things\r\nwere driving for war in Evesham’s silly, violent hands, and I had some\r\ninkling of what war was bound to be under these new conditions. And\r\neven then, though I knew it was drawing near the limit of my\r\nopportunity, I could find no will to go back.”\r\n\r\nHe sighed.\r\n\r\n“That was my last chance.\r\n\r\n“We didn’t go into the city until the sky was full of stars, so we\r\nwalked out upon the high terrace, to and fro, and—she counselled me to\r\ngo back.\r\n\r\n“‘My dearest,’ she said, and her sweet face looked up to me, this is\r\nDeath. This life you lead is Death. Go back to them, go back to your\r\nduty—’\r\n\r\n“She began to weep, saying, between her sobs, and clinging to my arm as\r\nshe said it, ‘Go back—Go back.’\r\n\r\n“Then suddenly she fell mute, and, glancing down at her face, I read in\r\nan instant the thing she had thought to do. It was one of those moments\r\nwhen one sees.\r\n\r\n“‘No!’ I said.\r\n\r\n“‘No?’ she asked, in surprise and I think a little fearful at the\r\nanswer to her thought.\r\n\r\n“‘Nothing,’ I said, ‘shall send me back. Nothing! I have chosen. Love,\r\nI have chosen, and the world must go. Whatever happens I will live this\r\nlife—I will live for you! It—nothing shall turn me aside; nothing, my\r\ndear one. Even if you died—even if you died—’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes?’ she murmured, softly.\r\n\r\n“‘Then—I also would die.’\r\n\r\n“And before she could speak again I began to talk, talking\r\neloquently—as I could do in that life—talking to exalt love, to make\r\nthe life we were living seem heroic and glorious; and the thing I was\r\ndeserting something hard and enormously ignoble that it was a fine\r\nthing to set aside. I bent all my mind to throw that glamour upon it,\r\nseeking not only to convert her but myself to that. We talked, and she\r\nclung to me, torn too between all that she deemed noble and all that\r\nshe knew was sweet. And at last I did make it heroic, made all the\r\nthickening disaster of the world only a sort of glorious setting to our\r\nunparalleled love, and we two poor foolish souls strutted there at\r\nlast, clad in that splendid delusion, drunken rather with that glorious\r\ndelusion, under the still stars.\r\n\r\n“And so my moment passed.\r\n\r\n“It was my last chance. Even as we went to and fro there, the leaders\r\nof the south and east were gathering their resolve, and the hot answer\r\nthat shattered Evesham’s bluffing for ever, took shape and waited. And,\r\nall over Asia, and the ocean, and the South, the air and the wires were\r\nthrobbing with their warnings to prepare—prepare.\r\n\r\n“No one living, you know, knew what war was; no one could imagine, with\r\nall these new inventions, what horror war might bring. I believe most\r\npeople still believed it would be a matter of bright uniforms and\r\nshouting charges and triumphs and flags and bands—in a time when half\r\nthe world drew its food supply from regions ten thousand miles away—”\r\n\r\nThe man with the white face paused. I glanced at him, and his face was\r\nintent on the floor of the carriage. A little railway station, a string\r\nof loaded trucks, a signal-box, and the back of a cottage, shot by the\r\ncarriage window, and a bridge passed with a clap of noise, echoing the\r\ntumult of the train.\r\n\r\n“After that,” he said, “I dreamt often. For three weeks of nights that\r\ndream was my life. And the worst of it was there were nights when I\r\ncould not dream, when I lay tossing on a bed in this accursed life; and\r\nthere—somewhere lost to me—things were happening—momentous, terrible\r\nthings . . . I lived at nights—my days, my waking days, this life I am\r\nliving now, became a faded, far-away dream, a drab setting, the cover\r\nof the book.”\r\n\r\nHe thought.\r\n\r\n“I could tell you all, tell you every little thing in the dream, but as\r\nto what I did in the daytime—no. I could not tell—I do not remember. My\r\nmemory—my memory has gone. The business of life slips from me—”\r\n\r\nHe leant forward, and pressed his hands upon his eyes. For a long time\r\nhe said nothing.\r\n\r\n“And then?” said I.\r\n\r\n“The war burst like a hurricane.”\r\n\r\nHe stared before him at unspeakable things.\r\n\r\n“And then?” I urged again.\r\n\r\n“One touch of unreality,” he said, in the low tone of a man who speaks\r\nto himself, “and they would have been nightmares. But they were not\r\nnightmares—they were not nightmares. No!”\r\n\r\nHe was silent for so long that it dawned upon me that there was a\r\ndanger of losing the rest of the story. But he went on talking again in\r\nthe same tone of questioning self-communion.\r\n\r\n“What was there to do but flight? I had not thought the war would touch\r\nCapri—I had seemed to see Capri as being out of it all, as the contrast\r\nto it all; but two nights after the whole place was shouting and\r\nbawling, every woman almost and every other man wore a badge—Evesham’s\r\nbadge—and there was no music but a jangling war-song over and over\r\nagain, and everywhere men enlisting, and in the dancing halls they were\r\ndrilling. The whole island was awhirl with rumours; it was said, again\r\nand again, that fighting had begun. I had not expected this. I had seen\r\nso little of the life of pleasure that I had failed to reckon with this\r\nviolence of the amateurs. And as for me, I was out of it. I was like\r\nthe man who might have prevented the firing of a magazine. The time had\r\ngone. I was no one; the vainest stripling with a badge counted for more\r\nthan I. The crowd jostled us and bawled in our ears; that accursed song\r\ndeafened us; a woman shrieked at my lady because no badge was on her,\r\nand we two went back to our own place again, ruffled and insulted—my\r\nlady white and silent, and I aquiver with rage. So furious was I, I\r\ncould have quarrelled with her if I could have found one shade of\r\naccusation in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“All my magnificence had gone from me. I walked up and down our rock\r\ncell, and outside was the darkling sea and a light to the southward\r\nthat flared and passed and came again.\r\n\r\n“‘We must get out of this place,’ I said over and over. ‘I have made my\r\nchoice, and I will have no hand in these troubles. I will have nothing\r\nof this war. We have taken our lives out of all these things. This is\r\nno refuge for us. Let us go.’\r\n\r\n“And the next day we were already in flight from the war that covered\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n“And all the rest was Flight—all the rest was Flight.”\r\n\r\nHe mused darkly.\r\n\r\n“How much was there of it?”\r\n\r\nHe made no answer.\r\n\r\n“How many days?”\r\n\r\nHis face was white and drawn and his hands were clenched. He took no\r\nheed of my curiosity.\r\n\r\nI tried to draw him back to his story with questions.\r\n\r\n“Where did you go?” I said.\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“When you left Capri.”\r\n\r\n“South-west,” he said, and glanced at me for a second. “We went in a\r\nboat.”\r\n\r\n“But I should have thought an aeroplane?”\r\n\r\n“They had been seized.”\r\n\r\nI questioned him no more. Presently I thought he was beginning again.\r\nHe broke out in an argumentative monotone:\r\n\r\n“But why should it be? If, indeed, this battle, this slaughter and\r\nstress is life, why have we this craving for pleasure and beauty? If\r\nthere is no refuge, if there is no place of peace, and if all our\r\ndreams of quiet places are a folly and a snare, why have we such\r\ndreams? Surely it was no ignoble cravings, no base intentions, had\r\nbrought us to this; it was Love had isolated us. Love had come to me\r\nwith her eyes and robed in her beauty, more glorious than all else in\r\nlife, in the very shape and colour of life, and summoned me away. I had\r\nsilenced all the voices, I had answered all the questions—I had come to\r\nher. And suddenly there was nothing but War and Death!”\r\n\r\nI had an inspiration. “After all,” I said, “it could have been only a\r\ndream.”\r\n\r\n“A dream!” he cried, flaming upon me, “a dream—when, even now—”\r\n\r\nFor the first time he became animated. A faint flush crept into his\r\ncheek. He raised his open hand and clenched it, and dropped it to his\r\nknee. He spoke, looking away from me, and for all the rest of the time\r\nhe looked away. “We are but phantoms!” he said, “and the phantoms of\r\nphantoms, desires like cloud-shadows and wills of straw that eddy in\r\nthe wind; the days pass, use and wont carry us through as a train\r\ncarries the shadow of its lights—so be it! But one thing is real and\r\ncertain, one thing is no dream-stuff, but eternal and enduring. It is\r\nthe centre of my life, and all other things about it are subordinate or\r\naltogether vain. I loved her, that woman of a dream. And she and I are\r\ndead together!\r\n\r\n“A dream! How can it be a dream, when it drenched a living life with\r\nunappeasable sorrow, when it makes all that I have lived for and cared\r\nfor, worthless and unmeaning?\r\n\r\n“Until that very moment when she was killed I believed we had still a\r\nchance of getting away,” he said. “All through the night and morning\r\nthat we sailed across the sea from Capri to Salerno, we talked of\r\nescape. We were full of hope, and it clung about us to the end, hope\r\nfor the life together we should lead, out of it all, out of the battle\r\nand struggle, the wild and empty passions, the empty arbitrary ‘thou\r\nshalt’ and ‘thou shalt not’ of the world. We were uplifted, as though\r\nour quest was a holy thing, as though love for another was a mission .\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n“Even when from our boat we saw the fair face of that great rock\r\nCapri—already scarred and gashed by the gun emplacements and\r\nhiding-places that were to make it a fastness—we reckoned nothing of\r\nthe imminent slaughter, though the fury of preparation hung about in\r\nthe puffs and clouds of dust at a hundred points amidst the gray; but,\r\nindeed, I made a text of that and talked. There, you know, was the\r\nrock, still beautiful for all its scars, with its countless windows and\r\narches and ways, tier upon tier, for a thousand feet, a vast carving of\r\ngray, broken by vine-clad terraces, and lemon and orange groves, and\r\nmasses of agave and prickly pear, and puffs of almond blossom. And out\r\nunder the archway that is built over the Piccola Marina other boats\r\nwere coming; and as we came round the cape and within sight of the\r\nmainland, another little string of boats came into view, driving before\r\nthe wind towards the south-west. In a little while a multitude had come\r\nout, the remoter just little specks of ultramarine in the shadow of the\r\neastward cliff.\r\n\r\n“‘It is love and reason,’ I said, ‘fleeing from all this madness of\r\nwar.’\r\n\r\n“And though we presently saw a squadron of aeroplanes flying across the\r\nsouthern sky we did not heed it. There it was—a line of little dots in\r\nthe sky—and then more, dotting the south-eastern horizon, and then\r\nstill more, until all that quarter of the sky was stippled with blue\r\nspecks. Now they were all thin little strokes of blue, and now one and\r\nnow a multitude would heel and catch the sun and become short flashes\r\nof light. They came, rising and falling and growing larger, like some\r\nhuge flight of gulls or rooks or such-like birds, moving with a\r\nmarvellous uniformity, and ever as they drew nearer they spread over a\r\ngreater width of sky. The southward wind flung itself in an\r\narrow-headed cloud athwart the sun. And then suddenly they swept round\r\nto the eastward and streamed eastward, growing smaller and smaller and\r\nclearer and clearer again until they vanished from the sky. And after\r\nthat we noted to the northward and very high Evesham’s fighting\r\nmachines hanging high over Naples like an evening swarm of gnats.\r\n\r\n“It seemed to have no more to do with us than a flight of birds.\r\n\r\n“Even the mutter of guns far away in the south-east seemed to us to\r\nsignify nothing . . .\r\n\r\n“Each day, each dream after that, we were still exalted, still seeking\r\nthat refuge where we might live and love. Fatigue had come upon us,\r\npain and many distresses. For though we were dusty and stained by our\r\ntoilsome tramping, and half starved and with the horror of the dead men\r\nwe had seen and the flight of the peasants—for very soon a gust of\r\nfighting swept up the peninsula—with these things haunting our minds it\r\nstill resulted only in a deepening resolution to escape. Oh, but she\r\nwas brave and patient! She who had never faced hardship and exposure\r\nhad courage for herself and me. We went to and fro seeking an outlet,\r\nover a country all commandeered and ransacked by the gathering hosts of\r\nwar. Always we went on foot. At first there were other fugitives, but\r\nwe did not mingle with them. Some escaped northward, some were caught\r\nin the torrent of peasantry that swept along the main roads; many gave\r\nthemselves into the hands of the soldiery and were sent northward. Many\r\nof the men were impressed. But we kept away from these things; we had\r\nbrought no money to bribe a passage north, and I feared for my lady at\r\nthe hands of these conscript crowds. We had landed at Salerno, and we\r\nhad been turned back from Cava, and we had tried to cross towards\r\nTaranto by a pass over Mount Alburno, but we had been driven back for\r\nwant of food, and so we had come down among the marshes by Paestum,\r\nwhere those great temples stand alone. I had some vague idea that by\r\nPaestum it might be possible to find a boat or something, and take once\r\nmore to sea. And there it was the battle overtook us.\r\n\r\n“A sort of soul-blindness had me. Plainly I could see that we were\r\nbeing hemmed in; that the great net of that giant Warfare had us in its\r\ntoils. Many times we had seen the levies that had come down from the\r\nnorth going to and fro, and had come upon them in the distance amidst\r\nthe mountains making ways for the ammunition and preparing the mounting\r\nof the guns. Once we fancied they had fired at us, taking us for\r\nspies—at any rate a shot had gone shuddering over us. Several times we\r\nhad hidden in woods from hovering aeroplanes.\r\n\r\n“But all these things do not matter now, these nights of flight and\r\npain . . . We were in an open place near those great temples at\r\nPaestum, at last, on a blank stony place dotted with spiky bushes,\r\nempty and desolate and so flat that a grove of eucalyptus far away\r\nshowed to the feet of its stems. How I can see it! My lady was sitting\r\ndown under a bush resting a little, for she was very weak and weary,\r\nand I was standing up watching to see if I could tell the distance of\r\nthe firing that came and went. They were still, you know, fighting far\r\nfrom each other, with those terrible new weapons that had never before\r\nbeen used: guns that would carry beyond sight, and aeroplanes that\r\nwould do—What they would do no man could foretell.\r\n\r\n“I knew that we were between the two armies, and that they drew\r\ntogether. I knew we were in danger, and that we could not stop there\r\nand rest!\r\n\r\n“Though all these things were in my mind, they were in the background.\r\nThey seemed to be affairs beyond our concern. Chiefly, I was thinking\r\nof my lady. An aching distress filled me. For the first time she had\r\nowned herself beaten and had fallen a-weeping. Behind me I could hear\r\nher sobbing, but I would not turn round to her because I knew she had\r\nneed of weeping, and had held herself so far and so long for me. It was\r\nwell, I thought, that she would weep and rest and then we would toil on\r\nagain, for I had no inkling of the thing that hung so near. Even now I\r\ncan see her as she sat there, her lovely hair upon her shoulder, can\r\nmark again the deepening hollow of her cheek.\r\n\r\n“‘If we had parted,’ she said, ‘if I had let you go.’\r\n\r\n“‘No,’ said I. ‘Even now, I do not repent. I will not repent; I made my\r\nchoice, and I will hold on to the end.’\r\n\r\n“And then—\r\n\r\n“Overhead in the sky flashed something and burst, and all about us I\r\nheard the bullets making a noise like a handful of peas suddenly\r\nthrown. They chipped the stones about us, and whirled fragments from\r\nthe bricks and passed . . . .”\r\n\r\nHe put his hand to his mouth, and then moistened his lips.\r\n\r\n“At the flash I had turned about . . .\r\n\r\n“You know—she stood up—\r\n\r\n“She stood up, you know, and moved a step towards me—as though she\r\nwanted to reach me—\r\n\r\n“And she had been shot through the heart.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped and stared at me. I felt all that foolish incapacity an\r\nEnglishman feels on such occasions. I met his eyes for a moment, and\r\nthen stared out of the window. For a long space we kept silence. When\r\nat last I looked at him he was sitting back in his corner, his arms\r\nfolded, and his teeth gnawing at his knuckles.\r\n\r\nHe bit his nail suddenly, and stared at it.\r\n\r\n“I carried her,” he said, “towards the temples, in my arms—as though it\r\nmattered. I don’t know why. They seemed a sort of sanctuary, you know,\r\nthey had lasted so long, I suppose.\r\n\r\n“She must have died almost instantly. Only—I talked to her all the\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nSilence again.\r\n\r\n“I have seen those temples,” I said abruptly, and indeed he had brought\r\nthose still, sunlit arcades of worn sandstone very vividly before me.\r\n\r\n“It was the brown one, the big brown one. I sat down on a fallen pillar\r\nand held her in my arms . . . Silent after the first babble was over.\r\nAnd after a little while the lizards came out and ran about again, as\r\nthough nothing unusual was going on, as though nothing had changed . .\r\n. It was tremendously still there, the sun high and the shadows still;\r\neven the shadows of the weeds upon the entablature were still—in spite\r\nof the thudding and banging that went all about the sky.\r\n\r\n“I seem to remember that the aeroplanes came up out of the south, and\r\nthat the battle went away to the west. One aeroplane was struck, and\r\noverset and fell. I remember that—though it didn’t interest me in the\r\nleast. It didn’t seem to signify. It was like a wounded gull, you\r\nknow—flapping for a time in the water. I could see it down the aisle of\r\nthe temple—a black thing in the bright blue water.\r\n\r\n“Three or four times shells burst about the beach, and then that\r\nceased. Each time that happened all the lizards scuttled in and hid for\r\na space. That was all the mischief done, except that once a stray\r\nbullet gashed the stone hard by—made just a fresh bright surface.\r\n\r\n“As the shadows grew longer, the stillness seemed greater.\r\n\r\n“The curious thing,” he remarked, with the manner of a man who makes a\r\ntrivial conversation, “is that I didn’t _think_—at all. I sat with her\r\nin my arms amidst the stones—in a sort of lethargy—stagnant.\r\n\r\n“And I don’t remember waking up. I don’t remember dressing that day. I\r\nknow I found myself in my office, with my letters all slit open in\r\nfront of me, and how I was struck by the absurdity of being there,\r\nseeing that in reality I was sitting, stunned, in that Paestum Temple\r\nwith a dead woman in my arms. I read my letters like a machine. I have\r\nforgotten what they were about.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and there was a long silence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I perceived that we were running down the incline from Chalk\r\nFarm to Euston. I started at this passing of time. I turned on him with\r\na brutal question, with the tone of “Now or never.”\r\n\r\n“And did you dream again?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nHe seemed to force himself to finish. His voice was very low.\r\n\r\n“Once more, and as it were only for a few instants. I seemed to have\r\nsuddenly awakened out of a great apathy, to have risen into a sitting\r\nposition, and the body lay there on the stones beside me. A gaunt body.\r\nNot her, you know. So soon—it was not her . . . .\r\n\r\n“I may have heard voices. I do not know. Only I knew clearly that men\r\nwere coming into the solitude and that that was a last outrage.\r\n\r\n“I stood up and walked through the temple, and then there came into\r\nsight—first one man with a yellow face, dressed in a uniform of dirty\r\nwhite, trimmed with blue, and then several, climbing to the crest of\r\nthe old wall of the vanished city, and crouching there. They were\r\nlittle bright figures in the sunlight, and there they hung, weapon in\r\nhand, peering cautiously before them.\r\n\r\n“And further away I saw others and then more at another point in the\r\nwall. It was a long lax line of men in open order.\r\n\r\n“Presently the man I had first seen stood up and shouted a command, and\r\nhis men came tumbling down the wall and into the high weeds towards the\r\ntemple. He scrambled down with them and led them. He came facing\r\ntowards me, and when he saw me he stopped.\r\n\r\n“At first I had watched these men with a mere curiosity, but when I had\r\nseen they meant to come to the temple I was moved to forbid them. I\r\nshouted to the officer.\r\n\r\n“‘You must not come here,’ I cried, ‘_I_ am here. I am here with my\r\ndead.’\r\n\r\n“He stared, and then shouted a question back to me in some unknown\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\n“I repeated what I had said.\r\n\r\n“He shouted again, and I folded my arms and stood still. Presently he\r\nspoke to his men and came forward. He carried a drawn sword.\r\n\r\n“I signed to him to keep away, but he continued to advance. I told him\r\nagain very patiently and clearly: ‘You must not come here. These are\r\nold temples and I am here with my dead.’\r\n\r\n“Presently he was so close I could see his face clearly. It was a\r\nnarrow face, with dull gray eyes, and a black moustache. He had a scar\r\non his upper lip, and he was dirty and unshaven. He kept shouting\r\nunintelligible things, questions, perhaps, at me.\r\n\r\n“I know now that he was afraid of me, but at the time that did not\r\noccur to me. As I tried to explain to him, he interrupted me in\r\nimperious tones, bidding me, I suppose, stand aside.\r\n\r\n“He made to go past me, and I caught hold of him.\r\n\r\n“I saw his face change at my grip.\r\n\r\n“‘You fool,’ I cried. ‘Don’t you know? She is dead!’\r\n\r\n“He started back. He looked at me with cruel eyes. I saw a sort of\r\nexultant resolve leap into them—delight. Then, suddenly, with a scowl,\r\nhe swept his sword back—_so_—and thrust.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly.\r\n\r\nI became aware of a change in the rhythm of the train. The brakes\r\nlifted their voices and the carriage jarred and jerked. This present\r\nworld insisted upon itself, became clamourous. I saw through the steamy\r\nwindow huge electric lights glaring down from tall masts upon a fog,\r\nsaw rows of stationary empty carriages passing by, and then a\r\nsignal-box hoisting its constellation of green and red into the murky\r\nLondon twilight, marched after them. I looked again at his drawn\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\n“He ran me through the heart. It was with a sort of astonishment—no\r\nfear, no pain—but just amazement, that I felt it pierce me, felt the\r\nsword drive home into my body. It didn’t hurt, you know. It didn’t hurt\r\nat all.”\r\n\r\nThe yellow platform lights came into the field of view, passing first\r\nrapidly, then slowly, and at last stopping with a jerk. Dim shapes of\r\nmen passed to and fro without.\r\n\r\n“Euston!” cried a voice.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean—?”\r\n\r\n“There was no pain, no sting or smart. Amazement and then darkness\r\nsweeping over everything. The hot, brutal face before me, the face of\r\nthe man who had killed me, seemed to recede. It swept out of\r\nexistence—”\r\n\r\n“Euston!” clamoured the voices outside; “Euston!”\r\n\r\nThe carriage door opened admitting a flood of sound, and a porter stood\r\nregarding us. The sounds of doors slamming, and the hoof-clatter of\r\ncab-horses, and behind these things the featureless remote roar of the\r\nLondon cobble-stones, came to my ears. A truckload of lighted lamps\r\nblazed along the platform.\r\n\r\n“A darkness, a flood of darkness that opened and spread and blotted out\r\nall things.”\r\n\r\n“Any luggage, sir?” said the porter.\r\n\r\n“And that was the end?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to hesitate. Then, almost inaudibly, he answered, “_no_.”\r\n\r\n“You mean?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t get to her. She was there on the other side of the temple—\r\nAnd then—”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I insisted. “Yes?”\r\n\r\n“Nightmares,” he cried; “nightmares indeed! My God! Great birds that\r\nfought and tore.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night was hot and overcast, the sky red, rimmed with the lingering\r\nsunset of mid-summer. They sat at the open window, trying to fancy the\r\nair was fresher there. The trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff\r\nand dark; beyond in the roadway a gas-lamp burnt, bright orange against\r\nthe hazy blue of the evening. Farther were the three lights of the\r\nrailway signal against the lowering sky. The man and woman spoke to one\r\nanother in low tones.\r\n\r\n“He does not suspect?” said the man, a little nervously.\r\n\r\n“Not he,” she said peevishly, as though that too irritated her. “He\r\nthinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel. He has no\r\nimagination, no poetry.”\r\n\r\n“None of these men of iron have,” he said sententiously. “They have no\r\nhearts.”\r\n\r\n“_He_ has not,” she said. She turned her discontented face towards the\r\nwindow. The distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and grew\r\nin volume; the house quivered; one heard the metallic rattle of the\r\ntender. As the train passed, there was a glare of light above the\r\ncutting and a driving tumult of smoke; one, two, three, four, five,\r\nsix, seven, eight black oblongs—eight trucks—passed across the dim grey\r\nof the embankment, and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the\r\nthroat of the tunnel, which, with the last, seemed to swallow down\r\ntrain, smoke, and sound in one abrupt gulp.\r\n\r\n“This country was all fresh and beautiful once,” he said; “and now—it\r\nis Gehenna. Down that way—nothing but pot-banks and chimneys belching\r\nfire and dust into the face of heaven . . . . . But what does it\r\nmatter? An end comes, an end to all this cruelty . . . . .\r\n_To-morrow_.” He spoke the last word in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“_To-morrow_,” she said, speaking in a whisper too, and still staring\r\nout of the window.\r\n\r\n“Dear!” he said, putting his hand on hers.\r\n\r\nShe turned with a start, and their eyes searched one another’s. Hers\r\nsoftened to his gaze. “My dear one!” she said, and then: “It seems so\r\nstrange—that you should have come into my life like this—to open—” She\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n“To open?” he said.\r\n\r\n“All this wonderful world—” she hesitated, and spoke still more\r\nsoftly—“this world of _love_ to me.”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the door clicked and closed. They turned their heads, and\r\nhe started violently back. In the shadow of the room stood a great\r\nshadowy figure—silent. They saw the face dimly in the half-light, with\r\nunexpressive dark patches under the penthouse brows. Every muscle in\r\nRaut’s body suddenly became tense. When could the door have opened?\r\nWhat had he heard? Had he heard all? What had he seen? A tumult of\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer’s voice came at last, after a pause that seemed\r\ninterminable. “Well?” he said.\r\n\r\n“I was afraid I had missed you, Horrocks,” said the man at the window,\r\ngripping the window-ledge with his hand. His voice was unsteady.\r\n\r\nThe clumsy figure of Horrocks came forward out of the shadow. He made\r\nno answer to Raut’s remark. For a moment he stood above them.\r\n\r\nThe woman’s heart was cold within her. “I told Mr. Raut it was just\r\npossible you might come back,” she said, in a voice that never\r\nquivered.\r\n\r\nHorrocks, still silent, sat down abruptly in the chair by her little\r\nwork-table. His big hands were clenched; one saw now the fire of his\r\neyes under the shadow of his brows. He was trying to get his breath.\r\nHis eyes went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had\r\ntrusted, and then back to the woman.\r\n\r\nBy this time and for the moment all three half understood one another.\r\nYet none dared say a word to ease the pent-up things that choked them.\r\n\r\nIt was the husband’s voice that broke the silence at last.\r\n\r\n“You wanted to see me?” he said to Raut.\r\n\r\nRaut started as he spoke. “I came to see you,” he said, resolved to lie\r\nto the last.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Horrocks.\r\n\r\n“You promised,” said Raut, “to show me some fine effects of moonlight\r\nand smoke.”\r\n\r\n“I promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and smoke,”\r\nrepeated Horrocks in a colourless voice.\r\n\r\n“And I thought I might catch you to-night before you went down to the\r\nworks,” proceeded Raut, “and come with you.”\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. Did the man mean to take the thing coolly? Did\r\nhe after all know? How long had he been in the room? Yet even at the\r\nmoment when they heard the door, their attitudes. . . . Horrocks\r\nglanced at the profile of the woman, shadowy pallid in the half-light.\r\nThen he glanced at Raut, and seemed to recover himself suddenly. “Of\r\ncourse,” he said, “I promised to show you the works under their proper\r\ndramatic conditions. It’s odd how I could have forgotten.”\r\n\r\n“If I am troubling you—” began Raut.\r\n\r\nHorrocks started again. A new light had suddenly come into the sultry\r\ngloom of his eyes. “Not in the least,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Have you been telling Mr. Raut of all these contrasts of flame and\r\nshadow you think so splendid?” said the woman, turning now to her\r\nhusband for the first time, her confidence creeping back again, her\r\nvoice just one half-note too high. “That dreadful theory of yours that\r\nmachinery is beautiful, and everything else in the world ugly. I\r\nthought he would not spare you, Mr. Raut. It’s his great theory, his\r\none discovery in art.”\r\n\r\n“I am slow to make discoveries,” said Horrocks grimly, damping her\r\nsuddenly. “But what I discover . . . . .” He stopped.\r\n\r\n“Well?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Nothing;” and suddenly he rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n“I promised to show you the works,” he said to Raut, and put his big,\r\nclumsy hand on his friend’s shoulder. “And you are ready to go?”\r\n\r\n“Quite,” said Raut, and stood up also.\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. Each of them peered through the indistinctness\r\nof the dusk at the other two. Horrocks’ hand still rested on Raut’s\r\nshoulder. Raut half fancied still that the incident was trivial after\r\nall. But Mrs. Horrocks knew her husband better, knew that grim quiet in\r\nhis voice, and the confusion in her mind took a vague shape of physical\r\nevil. “Very well”, said Horrocks, and, dropping his hand, turned\r\ntowards the door.\r\n\r\n“My hat?” Raut looked round in the half-light.\r\n\r\n“That’s my work-basket,” said Mrs. Horrocks, with a gust of hysterical\r\nlaughter. Their hands came together on the back of the chair. “Here it\r\nis!” he said. She had an impulse to warn him in an undertone, but she\r\ncould not frame a word. “Don’t go!” and “Beware of him!” struggled in\r\nher mind, and the swift moment passed.\r\n\r\n“Got it?” said Horrocks, standing with the door half open.\r\n\r\nRaut stepped towards him. “Better say good-bye to Mrs. Horrocks,” said\r\nthe ironmaster, even more grimly quiet in his tone than before.\r\n\r\nRaut started and turned. “Good-evening, Mrs. Horrocks,” he said, and\r\ntheir hands touched.\r\n\r\nHorrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in him\r\ntowards men. Raut went out, and then, after a wordless look at her, her\r\nhusband followed. She stood motionless while Raut’s light footfall and\r\nher husband’s heavy tread, like bass and treble, passed down the\r\npassage together. The front door slammed heavily. She went to the\r\nwindow, moving slowly, and stood watching—leaning forward. The two men\r\nappeared for a moment at the gateway in the road, passed under the\r\nstreet lamp, and were hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery. The\r\nlamp-light fell for a moment on their faces, showing only unmeaning\r\npale patches, telling nothing of what she still feared, and doubted,\r\nand craved vainly to know. Then she sank down into a crouching attitude\r\nin the big arm-chair, her eyes wide open and staring out at the red\r\nlights from the furnaces that flickered in the sky. An hour after she\r\nwas still there, her attitude scarcely changed.\r\n\r\nThe oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon Raut. They\r\nwent side by side down the road in silence, and in silence turned into\r\nthe cinder-made by-way that presently opened out the prospect of the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nA blue haze, half dust, half mist, touched the long valley with\r\nmystery. Beyond were Hanley and Etruria, grey and dark masses, outlined\r\nthinly by the rare golden dots of the street lamps, and here and there\r\na gaslit window, or the yellow glare of some late-working factory or\r\ncrowded public-house. Out of the masses, clear and slender against the\r\nevening sky, rose a multitude of tall chimneys, many of them reeking, a\r\nfew smokeless during a season of “play.” Here and there a pallid patch\r\nand ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the position of a pot-bank,\r\nor a wheel, black and sharp against the hot lower sky, marked some\r\ncolliery where they raise the iridescent coal of the place. Nearer at\r\nhand was the broad stretch of railway, and half invisible trains\r\nshunted—a steady puffing and rumbling, with every run a ringing\r\nconcussion and a rhythmic series of impacts, and a passage of\r\nintermittent puffs of white steam across the further view. And to the\r\nleft, between the railway and the dark mass of the low hill beyond,\r\ndominating the whole view, colossal, inky-black, and crowned with smoke\r\nand fitful flames, stood the great cylinders of the Jeddah Company\r\nBlast Furnaces, the central edifices of the big ironworks of which\r\nHorrocks was the manager. They stood heavy and threatening, full of an\r\nincessant turmoil of flames and seething molten iron, and about the\r\nfeet of them rattled the rolling-mills, and the steam hammer beat\r\nheavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and thither. Even as\r\nthey looked, a truckful of fuel was shot into one of the giants, and\r\nthe red flames gleamed out, and a confusion of smoke and black dust\r\ncame boiling upwards towards the sky.\r\n\r\n“Certainly you get some fine effects of colour with your furnaces,”\r\nsaid Raut, breaking a silence that had become apprehensive.\r\n\r\nHorrocks grunted. He stood with his hands in his pockets, frowning down\r\nat the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond, frowning as\r\nif he were thinking out some knotty problem.\r\n\r\nRaut glanced at him and away again. “At present your moonlight effect\r\nis hardly ripe,” he continued, looking upward. “The moon is still\r\nsmothered by the vestiges of daylight.”\r\n\r\nHorrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly\r\nawakened. “Vestiges of daylight? . . . . Of course, of course.” He too\r\nlooked up at the moon, pale still in the midsummer sky. “Come along,”\r\nhe said suddenly, and, gripping Raut’s arm in his hand, made a move\r\ntowards the path that dropped from them to the railway.\r\n\r\nRaut hung back. Their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment\r\nthat their eyes came near to say. Horrocks’ hand tightened and then\r\nrelaxed. He let go, and before Raut was aware of it, they were arm in\r\narm, and walking, one unwillingly enough, down the path.\r\n\r\n“You see the fine effect of the railway signals towards Burslem,” said\r\nHorrocks, suddenly breaking into loquacity, striding fast, and\r\ntightening the grip of his elbow the while. “Little green lights and\r\nred and white lights, all against the haze. You have an eye for effect,\r\nRaut. It’s a fine effect. And look at those furnaces of mine, how they\r\nrise upon us as we come down the hill. That to the right is my\r\npet—seventy feet of him. I packed him myself, and he’s boiled away\r\ncheerfully with iron in his guts for five long years. I’ve a particular\r\nfancy for _him_. That line of red there—a lovely bit of warm orange\r\nyou’d call it, Raut—that’s the puddlers’ furnaces, and there, in the\r\nhot light, three black figures—did you see the white splash of the\r\nsteam-hammer then?—that’s the rolling mills. Come along! Clang,\r\nclatter, how it goes rattling across the floor! Sheet tin,\r\nRaut,—amazing stuff. Glass mirrors are not in it when that stuff comes\r\nfrom the mill. And, squelch!—there goes the hammer again. Come along!”\r\n\r\nHe had to stop talking to catch at his breath. His arm twisted into\r\nRaut’s with benumbing tightness. He had come striding down the black\r\npath towards the railway as though he was possessed. Raut had not\r\nspoken a word, had simply hung back against Horrocks’ pull with all his\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n“I say,” he said now, laughing nervously, but with an undernote of\r\nsnarl in his voice, “why on earth are you nipping my arm off, Horrocks,\r\nand dragging me along like this?”\r\n\r\nAt length Horrocks released him. His manner changed again. “Nipping\r\nyour arm off?” he said. “Sorry. But it’s you taught me the trick of\r\nwalking in that friendly way.”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t learnt the refinements of it yet then,” said Raut,\r\nlaughing artificially again. “By Jove! I’m black and blue.” Horrocks\r\noffered no apology. They stood now near the bottom of the hill, close\r\nto the fence that bordered the railway. The ironworks had grown larger\r\nand spread out with their approach. They looked up to the blast\r\nfurnaces now instead of down; the further view of Etruria and Hanley\r\nhad dropped out of sight with their descent. Before them, by the stile\r\nrose a notice-board, bearing still dimly visible, the words, “BEWARE OF\r\nTHE TRAINS,” half hidden by splashes of coaly mud.\r\n\r\n“Fine effects,” said Horrocks, waving his arm. “Here comes a train. The\r\npuffs of smoke, the orange glare, the round eye of light in front of\r\nit, the melodious rattle. Fine effects! But these furnaces of mine used\r\nto be finer, before we shoved cones in their throats, and saved the\r\ngas.”\r\n\r\n“How?” said Raut. “Cones?”\r\n\r\n“Cones, my man, cones. I’ll show you one nearer. The flames used to\r\nflare out of the open throats, great—what is it?—pillars of cloud by\r\nday, red and black smoke, and pillars of fire by night. Now we run it\r\noff in pipes, and burn it to heat the blast, and the top is shut by a\r\ncone. You’ll be interested in that cone.”\r\n\r\n“But every now and then,” said Raut, “you get a burst of fire and smoke\r\nup there.”\r\n\r\n“The cone’s not fixed, it’s hung by a chain from a lever, and balanced\r\nby an equipoise. You shall see it nearer. Else, of course, there’d be\r\nno way of getting fuel into the thing. Every now and then the cone\r\ndips, and out comes the flare.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Raut. He looked over his shoulder. “The moon gets\r\nbrighter,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Come along,” said Horrocks abruptly, gripping his shoulder again, and\r\nmoving him suddenly towards the railway crossing. And then came one of\r\nthose swift incidents, vivid, but so rapid that they leave one doubtful\r\nand reeling. Halfway across, Horrocks’ hand suddenly clenched upon him\r\nlike a vice, and swung him backward and through a half-turn, so that he\r\nlooked up the line. And there a chain of lamp-lit carriage-windows\r\ntelescoped swiftly as it came towards them, and the red and yellow\r\nlights of an engine grew larger and larger, rushing down upon them. As\r\nhe grasped what this meant, he turned his face to Horrocks, and pushed\r\nwith all his strength against the arm that held him back between the\r\nrails. The struggle did not last a moment. Just as certain as it was\r\nthat Horrocks held him there, so certain was it that he had been\r\nviolently lugged out of danger.\r\n\r\n“Out of the way,” said Horrocks, with a gasp, as the train came\r\nrattling by, and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks.\r\n\r\n“I did not see it coming,” said Raut, still, even in spite of his own\r\napprehensions, trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse.\r\n\r\nHorrocks answered with a grunt. “The cone,” he said, and then, as one\r\nwho recovers himself, “I thought you did not hear.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t,” said Raut.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t have had you run over then for the world,” said Horrocks.\r\n\r\n“For a moment I lost my nerve,” said Raut.\r\n\r\nHorrocks stood for half a minute, then turned abruptly towards the\r\nironworks again. “See how fine these great mounds of mine, these\r\nclinker-heaps, look in the night! That truck yonder, up above there! Up\r\nit goes, and out-tilts the slag. See the palpitating red stuff go\r\nsliding down the slope. As we get nearer, the heap rises up and cuts\r\nthe blast furnaces. See the quiver up above the big one. Not that way!\r\nThis way, between the heaps. That goes to the puddling furnaces, but I\r\nwant to show you the canal first.” He came and took Raut by the elbow,\r\nand so they went along side by side. Raut answered Horrocks vaguely.\r\nWhat, he asked himself, had really happened on the line? Was he\r\ndeluding himself with his own fancies, or had Horrocks actually held\r\nhim back in the way of the train? Had he just been within an ace of\r\nbeing murdered?\r\n\r\nSuppose this slouching, scowling monster _did_ know anything? For a\r\nminute or two then Raut was really afraid for his life, but the mood\r\npassed as he reasoned with himself. After all, Horrocks might have\r\nheard nothing. At any rate, he had pulled him out of the way in time.\r\nHis odd manner might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown\r\nonce before. He was talking now of the ash-heaps and the canal. “Eigh?”\r\nsaid Horrocks.\r\n\r\n“What?” said Raut. “Rather! The haze in the moonlight. Fine!”\r\n\r\n“Our canal,” said Horrocks, stopping suddenly. “Our canal by moonlight\r\nand firelight is an immense effect. You’ve never seen it? Fancy that!\r\nYou’ve spent too many of your evenings philandering up in Newcastle\r\nthere. I tell you, for real florid effects—But you shall see. Boiling\r\nwater . . .”\r\n\r\nAs they came out of the labyrinth of clinker-heaps and mounds of coal\r\nand ore, the noises of the rolling-mill sprang upon them suddenly,\r\nloud, near, and distinct. Three shadowy workmen went by and touched\r\ntheir caps to Horrocks. Their faces were vague in the darkness. Raut\r\nfelt a futile impulse to address them, and before he could frame his\r\nwords, they passed into the shadows. Horrocks pointed to the canal\r\nclose before them now: a weird-looking place it seemed, in the\r\nblood-red reflections of the furnaces. The hot water that cooled the\r\ntuyeres came into it, some fifty yards up—a tumultuous, almost boiling\r\naffluent, and the steam rose up from the water in silent white wisps\r\nand streaks, wrapping damply about them, an incessant succession of\r\nghosts coming up from the black and red eddies, a white uprising that\r\nmade the head swim. The shining black tower of the larger blast-furnace\r\nrose overhead out of the mist, and its tumultuous riot filled their\r\nears. Raut kept away from the edge of the water, and watched Horrocks.\r\n\r\n“Here it is red,” said Horrocks, “blood-red vapour as red and hot as\r\nsin; but yonder there, where the moonlight falls on it, and it drives\r\nacross the clinker-heaps, it is as white as death.”\r\n\r\nRaut turned his head for a moment, and then came back hastily to his\r\nwatch on Horrocks. “Come along to the rolling-mills,” said Horrocks.\r\nThe threatening hold was not so evident that time, and Raut felt a\r\nlittle reassured. But all the same, what on earth did Horrocks mean\r\nabout “white as death” and “red as sin?” Coincidence, perhaps?\r\n\r\nThey went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while, and then\r\nthrough the rolling-mills, where amidst an incessant din the deliberate\r\nsteam-hammer beat the juice out of the succulent iron, and black,\r\nhalf-naked Titans rushed the plastic bars, like hot sealing-wax,\r\nbetween the wheels. “Come on,” said Horrocks in Raut’s ear, and they\r\nwent and peeped through the little glass hole behind the tuyeres, and\r\nsaw the tumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blast-furnace. It left\r\none eye blinded for a while. Then, with green and blue patches dancing\r\nacross the dark, they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore and\r\nfuel and lime were raised to the top of the big cylinder.\r\n\r\nAnd out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace, Raut’s doubts\r\ncame upon him again. Was it wise to be here? If Horrocks did\r\nknow—everything! Do what he would, he could not resist a violent\r\ntrembling. Right under foot was a sheer depth of seventy feet. It was a\r\ndangerous place. They pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing\r\nthat crowned the place. The reek of the furnace, a sulphurous vapor\r\nstreaked with pungent bitterness, seemed to make the distant hillside\r\nof Hanley quiver. The moon was riding out now from among a drift of\r\nclouds, halfway up the sky above the undulating wooded outlines of\r\nNewcastle. The steaming canal ran away from below them under an\r\nindistinct bridge, and vanished into the dim haze of the flat fields\r\ntowards Burslem.\r\n\r\n“That’s the cone I’ve been telling you of,” shouted Horrocks; “and,\r\nbelow that, sixty feet of fire and molten metal, with the air of the\r\nblast frothing through it like gas in soda-water.”\r\n\r\nRaut gripped the hand-rail tightly, and stared down at the cone. The\r\nheat was intense. The boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast\r\nmade a thunderous accompaniment to Horrocks’ voice. But the thing had\r\nto be gone through now. Perhaps, after all . . .\r\n\r\n“In the middle,” bawled Horrocks, “temperature near a thousand degrees.\r\nIf _you_ were dropped into it . . . . flash into flame like a pinch of\r\ngunpowder in a candle. Put your hand out and feel the heat of his\r\nbreath. Why, even up here I’ve seen the rain-water boiling off the\r\ntrucks. And that cone there. It’s a damned sight too hot for roasting\r\ncakes. The top side of it’s three hundred degrees.”\r\n\r\n“Three hundred degrees!” said Raut.\r\n\r\n“Three hundred centigrade, mind!” said Horrocks. “It will boil the\r\nblood out of you in no time.”\r\n\r\n“Eigh?” said Raut, and turned.\r\n\r\n“Boil the blood out of you in . . . No, you don’t!”\r\n\r\n“Let me go!” screamed Raut. “Let go my arm!”\r\n\r\nWith one hand he clutched at the hand-rail, then with both. For a\r\nmoment the two men stood swaying. Then suddenly, with a violent jerk,\r\nHorrocks had twisted him from his hold. He clutched at Horrocks and\r\nmissed, his foot went back into empty air; in mid-air he twisted\r\nhimself, and then cheek and shoulder and knee struck the hot cone\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nHe clutched the chain by which the cone hung, and the thing sank an\r\ninfinitesimal amount as he struck it. A circle of glowing red appeared\r\nabout him, and a tongue of flame, released from the chaos within,\r\nflickered up towards him. An intense pain assailed him at the knees,\r\nand he could smell the singeing of his hands. He raised himself to his\r\nfeet, and tried to climb up the chain, and then something struck his\r\nhead. Black and shining with the moonlight, the throat of the furnace\r\nrose about him.\r\n\r\nHorrocks, he saw, stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the\r\nrail. The gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight,\r\nand shouting, “Fizzle, you fool! Fizzle, you hunter of women! You\r\nhot-blooded hound! Boil! boil! boil!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck, and flung it\r\ndeliberately, lump after lump, at Raut.\r\n\r\n“Horrocks!” cried Raut. “Horrocks!”\r\n\r\nHe clung crying to the chain, pulling himself up from the burning of\r\nthe cone. Each missile Horrocks flung hit him. His clothes charred and\r\nglowed, and as he struggled the cone dropped, and a rush of hot\r\nsuffocating gas whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nHis human likeness departed from him. When the momentary red had\r\npassed, Horrocks saw a charred, blackened figure, its head streaked\r\nwith blood, still clutching and fumbling with the chain, and writhing\r\nin agony—a cindery animal, an inhuman, monstrous creature that began a\r\nsobbing intermittent shriek.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, at the sight, the ironmaster’s anger passed. A deadly\r\nsickness came upon him. The heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting\r\nup to his nostrils. His sanity returned to him.\r\n\r\n“God have mercy upon me!” he cried. “O God! what have I done?”\r\n\r\nHe knew the thing below him, save that it still moved and felt, was\r\nalready a dead man—that the blood of the poor wretch must be boiling in\r\nhis veins. An intense realisation of that agony came to his mind, and\r\novercame every other feeling. For a moment he stood irresolute, and\r\nthen, turning to the truck, he hastily tilted its contents upon the\r\nstruggling thing that had once been a man. The mass fell with a thud,\r\nand went radiating over the cone. With the thud the shriek ended, and a\r\nboiling confusion of smoke, dust, and flame came rushing up towards\r\nhim. As it passed, he saw the cone clear again.\r\n\r\nThen he staggered back, and stood trembling, clinging to the rail with\r\nboth hands. His lips moved, but no words came to them.\r\n\r\nDown below was the sound of voices and running steps. The clangour of\r\nrolling in the shed ceased abruptly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MOONLIGHT FABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a little man whose mother made him a beautiful suit of\r\nclothes. It was green and gold and woven so that I cannot describe how\r\ndelicate and fine it was, and there was a tie of orange fluffiness that\r\ntied up under his chin. And the buttons in their newness shone like\r\nstars. He was proud and pleased by his suit beyond measure, and stood\r\nbefore the long looking-glass when first he put it on, so astonished\r\nand delighted with it that he could hardly turn himself away.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to wear it everywhere and show it to all sorts of people. He\r\nthought over all the places he had ever visited and all the scenes he\r\nhad ever heard described, and tried to imagine what the feel of it\r\nwould be if he were to go now to those scenes and places wearing his\r\nshining suit, and he wanted to go out forthwith into the long grass and\r\nthe hot sunshine of the meadow wearing it. Just to wear it! But his\r\nmother told him, “No.” She told him he must take great care of his\r\nsuit, for never would he have another nearly so fine; he must save it\r\nand save it and only wear it on rare and great occasions. It was his\r\nwedding suit, she said. And she took his buttons and twisted them up\r\nwith tissue paper for fear their bright newness should be tarnished,\r\nand she tacked little guards over the cuffs and elbows and wherever the\r\nsuit was most likely to come to harm. He hated and resisted these\r\nthings, but what could he do? And at last her warnings and persuasions\r\nhad effect and he consented to take off his beautiful suit and fold it\r\ninto its proper creases and put it away. It was almost as though he\r\ngave it up again. But he was always thinking of wearing it and of the\r\nsupreme occasion when some day it might be worn without the guards,\r\nwithout the tissue paper on the buttons, utterly and delightfully,\r\nnever caring, beautiful beyond measure.\r\n\r\nOne night when he was dreaming of it, after his habit, he dreamed he\r\ntook the tissue paper from one of the buttons and found its brightness\r\na little faded, and that distressed him mightily in his dream. He\r\npolished the poor faded button and polished it, and if anything it grew\r\nduller. He woke up and lay awake thinking of the brightness a little\r\ndulled and wondering how he would feel if perhaps when the great\r\noccasion (whatever it might be) should arrive, one button should chance\r\nto be ever so little short of its first glittering freshness, and for\r\ndays and days that thought remained with him, distressingly. And when\r\nnext his mother let him wear his suit, he was tempted and nearly gave\r\nway to the temptation just to fumble off one little bit of tissue paper\r\nand see if indeed the buttons were keeping as bright as ever.\r\n\r\nHe went trimly along on his way to church full of this wild desire. For\r\nyou must know his mother did, with repeated and careful warnings, let\r\nhim wear his suit at times, on Sundays, for example, to and fro from\r\nchurch, when there was no threatening of rain, no dust nor anything to\r\ninjure it, with its buttons covered and its protections tacked upon it\r\nand a sunshade in his hand to shadow it if there seemed too strong a\r\nsunlight for its colours. And always, after such occasions, he brushed\r\nit over and folded it exquisitely as she had taught him, and put it\r\naway again.\r\n\r\nNow all these restrictions his mother set to the wearing of his suit he\r\nobeyed, always he obeyed them, until one strange night he woke up and\r\nsaw the moonlight shining outside his window. It seemed to him the\r\nmoonlight was not common moonlight, nor the night a common night, and\r\nfor a while he lay quite drowsily with this odd persuasion in his mind.\r\nThought joined on to thought like things that whisper warmly in the\r\nshadows. Then he sat up in his little bed suddenly, very alert, with\r\nhis heart beating very fast and a quiver in his body from top to toe.\r\nHe had made up his mind. He knew now that he was going to wear his suit\r\nas it should be worn. He had no doubt in the matter. He was afraid,\r\nterribly afraid, but glad, glad.\r\n\r\nHe got out of his bed and stood a moment by the window looking at the\r\nmoonshine-flooded garden and trembling at the thing he meant to do. The\r\nair was full of a minute clamor of crickets and murmurings, of the\r\ninfinitesimal shouting of little living things. He went very gently\r\nacross the creaking boards, for fear that he might wake the sleeping\r\nhouse, to the big dark clothes-press wherein his beautiful suit lay\r\nfolded, and he took it out garment by garment and softly and very\r\neagerly tore off its tissue-paper covering and its tacked protections,\r\nuntil there it was, perfect and delightful as he had seen it when first\r\nhis mother had given it to him—a long time it seemed ago. Not a button\r\nhad tarnished, not a thread had faded on this dear suit of his; he was\r\nglad enough for weeping as in a noiseless hurry he put it on. And then\r\nback he went, soft and quick, to the window and looked out upon the\r\ngarden and stood there for a minute, shining in the moonlight, with his\r\nbuttons twinkling like stars, before he got out on the sill and, making\r\nas little of a rustling as he could, clambered down to the garden path\r\nbelow. He stood before his mother’s house, and it was white and nearly\r\nas plain as by day, with every window-blind but his own shut like an\r\neye that sleeps. The trees cast still shadows like intricate black lace\r\nupon the wall.\r\n\r\nThe garden in the moonlight was very different from the garden by day;\r\nmoonshine was tangled in the hedges and stretched in phantom cobwebs\r\nfrom spray to spray. Every flower was gleaming white or crimson black,\r\nand the air was aquiver with the thridding of small crickets and\r\nnightingales singing unseen in the depths of the trees.\r\n\r\nThere was no darkness in the world, but only warm, mysterious shadows;\r\nand all the leaves and spikes were edged and lined with iridescent\r\njewels of dew. The night was warmer than any night had ever been, the\r\nheavens by some miracle at once vaster and nearer, and spite of the\r\ngreat ivory-tinted moon that ruled the world, the sky was full of\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nThe little man did not shout nor sing for all his infinite gladness. He\r\nstood for a time like one awe-stricken, and then, with a queer small\r\ncry and holding out his arms, he ran out as if he would embrace at once\r\nthe whole warm round immensity of the world. He did not follow the neat\r\nset paths that cut the garden squarely, but thrust across the beds and\r\nthrough the wet, tall, scented herbs, through the night stock and the\r\nnicotine and the clusters of phantom white mallow flowers and through\r\nthe thickets of southern-wood and lavender, and knee-deep across a wide\r\nspace of mignonette. He came to the great hedge and he thrust his way\r\nthrough it, and though the thorns of the brambles scored him deeply and\r\ntore threads from his wonderful suit, and though burs and goosegrass\r\nand havers caught and clung to him, he did not care. He did not care,\r\nfor he knew it was all part of the wearing for which he had longed. “I\r\nam glad I put on my suit,” he said; “I am glad I wore my suit.”\r\n\r\nBeyond the hedge he came to the duck-pond, or at least to what was the\r\nduck-pond by day. But by night it was a great bowl of silver moonshine\r\nall noisy with singing frogs, of wonderful silver moonshine twisted and\r\nclotted with strange patternings, and the little man ran down into its\r\nwaters between the thin black rushes, knee-deep and waist-deep and to\r\nhis shoulders, smiting the water to black and shining wavelets with\r\neither hand, swaying and shivering wavelets, amid which the stars were\r\nnetted in the tangled reflections of the brooding trees upon the bank.\r\nHe waded until he swam, and so he crossed the pond and came out upon\r\nthe other side, trailing, as it seemed to him, not duckweed, but very\r\nsilver in long, clinging, dripping masses. And up he went through the\r\ntransfigured tangles of the willow-herb and the uncut seeding grass of\r\nthe farther bank. And so he came glad and breathless into the highroad.\r\n“I am glad,” he said, “beyond measure, that I had clothes that fitted\r\nthis occasion.”\r\n\r\nThe highroad ran straight as an arrow flies, straight into the deep\r\nblue pit of sky beneath the moon, a white and shining road between the\r\nsinging nightingales, and along it he went, running now and leaping,\r\nand now walking and rejoicing, in the clothes his mother had made for\r\nhim with tireless, loving hands. The road was deep in dust, but that\r\nfor him was only soft whiteness, and as he went a great dim moth came\r\nfluttering round his wet and shimmering and hastening figure. At first\r\nhe did not heed the moth, and then he waved his hands at it and made a\r\nsort of dance with it as it circled round his head. “Soft moth!” he\r\ncried, “dear moth! And wonderful night, wonderful night of the world!\r\nDo you think my clothes are beautiful, dear moth? As beautiful as your\r\nscales and all this silver vesture of the earth and sky?”\r\n\r\nAnd the moth circled closer and closer until at last its velvet wings\r\njust brushed his lips . . . . .\r\n\r\nAnd next morning they found him dead with his neck broken in the bottom\r\nof the stone pit, with his beautiful clothes a little bloody and foul\r\nand stained with the duckweed from the pond. But his face was a face of\r\nsuch happiness that, had you seen it, you would have understood indeed\r\nhow that he had died happy, never knowing the cool and streaming silver\r\nfor the duckweed in the pond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIAMOND MAKER\r\n\r\n\r\nSome business had detained me in Chancery Lane until nine in the\r\nevening, and thereafter, having some inkling of a headache, I was\r\ndisinclined either for entertainment or further work. So much of the\r\nsky as the high cliffs of that narrow canon of traffic left visible\r\nspoke of a serene night, and I determined to make my way down to the\r\nEmbankment, and rest my eyes and cool my head by watching the\r\nvariegated lights upon the river. Beyond comparison the night is the\r\nbest time for this place; a merciful darkness hides the dirt of the\r\nwaters, and the lights of this transitional age, red glaring orange,\r\ngas-yellow, and electric white, are set in shadowy outlines of every\r\npossible shade between grey and deep purple. Through the arches of\r\nWaterloo Bridge a hundred points of light mark the sweep of the\r\nEmbankment, and above its parapet rise the towers of Westminster, warm\r\ngrey against the starlight. The black river goes by with only a rare\r\nripple breaking its silence, and disturbing the reflections of the\r\nlights that swim upon its surface.\r\n\r\n“A warm night,” said a voice at my side.\r\n\r\nI turned my head, and saw the profile of a man who was leaning over the\r\nparapet beside me. It was a refined face, not unhandsome, though\r\npinched and pale enough, and the coat collar turned up and pinned round\r\nthe throat marked his status in life as sharply as a uniform. I felt I\r\nwas committed to the price of a bed and breakfast if I answered him.\r\n\r\nI looked at him curiously. Would he have anything to tell me worth the\r\nmoney, or was he the common incapable—incapable even of telling his own\r\nstory? There was a quality of intelligence in his forehead and eyes,\r\nand a certain tremulousness in his nether lip that decided me.\r\n\r\n“Very warm,” said I; “but not too warm for us here.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, still looking across the water, “it is pleasant enough\r\nhere . . . . just now.”\r\n\r\n“It is good,” he continued after a pause, “to find anything so restful\r\nas this in London. After one has been fretting about business all day,\r\nabout getting on, meeting obligations, and parrying dangers, I do not\r\nknow what one would do if it were not for such pacific corners.” He\r\nspoke with long pauses between the sentences. “You must know a little\r\nof the irksome labour of the world, or you would not be here. But I\r\ndoubt if you can be so brain-weary and footsore as I am . . . . Bah!\r\nSometimes I doubt if the game is worth the candle. I feel inclined to\r\nthrow the whole thing over—name, wealth and position—and take to some\r\nmodest trade. But I know if I abandoned my ambition—hardly as she uses\r\nme—I should have nothing but remorse left for the rest of my days.”\r\n\r\nHe became silent. I looked at him in astonishment. If ever I saw a man\r\nhopelessly hard-up it was the man in front of me. He was ragged and he\r\nwas dirty, unshaven and unkempt; he looked as though he had been left\r\nin a dust-bin for a week. And he was talking to _me_ of the irksome\r\nworries of a large business. I almost laughed outright. Either he was\r\nmad or playing a sorry jest on his own poverty.\r\n\r\n“If high aims and high positions,” said I, “have their drawbacks of\r\nhard work and anxiety, they have their compensations. Influence, the\r\npower of doing good, of assisting those weaker and poorer than\r\nourselves; and there is even a certain gratification in display . . . .\r\n. ”\r\n\r\nMy banter under the circumstances was in very vile taste. I spoke on\r\nthe spur of the contrast of his appearance and speech. I was sorry even\r\nwhile I was speaking.\r\n\r\nHe turned a haggard but very composed face upon me. Said he: “I forgot\r\nmyself. Of course you would not understand.”\r\n\r\nHe measured me for a moment. “No doubt it is very absurd. You will not\r\nbelieve me even when I tell you, so that it is fairly safe to tell you.\r\nAnd it will be a comfort to tell someone. I really have a big business\r\nin hand, a very big business. But there are troubles just now. The fact\r\nis . . . . I make diamonds.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” said I, “you are out of work just at present?”\r\n\r\n“I am sick of being disbelieved,” he said impatiently, and suddenly\r\nunbuttoning his wretched coat he pulled out a little canvas bag that\r\nwas hanging by a cord round his neck. From this he produced a brown\r\npebble. “I wonder if you know enough to know what that is?” He handed\r\nit to me.\r\n\r\nNow, a year or so ago, I had occupied my leisure in taking a London\r\nscience degree, so that I have a smattering of physics and mineralogy.\r\nThe thing was not unlike an uncut diamond of the darker sort, though\r\nfar too large, being almost as big as the top of my thumb. I took it,\r\nand saw it had the form of a regular octahedron, with the curved faces\r\npeculiar to the most precious of minerals. I took out my penknife and\r\ntried to scratch it—vainly. Leaning forward towards the gas-lamp, I\r\ntried the thing on my watch-glass, and scored a white line across that\r\nwith the greatest ease.\r\n\r\nI looked at my interlocutor with rising curiosity. “It certainly is\r\nrather like a diamond. But, if so, it is a Behemoth of diamonds. Where\r\ndid you get it?”\r\n\r\n“I tell you I made it,” he said. “Give it back to me.”\r\n\r\nHe replaced it hastily and buttoned his jacket. “I will sell it you for\r\none hundred pounds,” he suddenly whispered eagerly. With that my\r\nsuspicions returned. The thing might, after all, be merely a lump of\r\nthat almost equally hard substance, corundum, with an accidental\r\nresemblance in shape to the diamond. Or if it was a diamond, how came\r\nhe by it, and why should he offer it at a hundred pounds?\r\n\r\nWe looked into one another’s eyes. He seemed eager, but honestly eager.\r\nAt that moment I believed it was a diamond he was trying to sell. Yet I\r\nam a poor man, a hundred pounds would leave a visible gap in my\r\nfortunes and no sane man would buy a diamond by gaslight from a ragged\r\ntramp on his personal warranty only. Still, a diamond that size\r\nconjured up a vision of many thousands of pounds. Then, thought I, such\r\na stone could scarcely exist without being mentioned in every book on\r\ngems, and again I called to mind the stories of contraband and\r\nlight-fingered Kaffirs at the Cape. I put the question of purchase on\r\none side.\r\n\r\n“How did you get it?” said I.\r\n\r\n“I made it.”\r\n\r\nI had heard something of Moissan, but I knew his artificial diamonds\r\nwere very small. I shook my head.\r\n\r\n“You seem to know something of this kind of thing. I will tell you a\r\nlittle about myself. Perhaps then you may think better of the\r\npurchase.” He turned round with his back to the river, and put his\r\nhands in his pockets. He sighed. “I know you will not believe me.”\r\n\r\n“Diamonds,” he began—and as he spoke his voice lost its faint flavour\r\nof the tramp and assumed something of the easy tone of an educated\r\nman—“are to be made by throwing carbon out of combination in a suitable\r\nflux and under a suitable pressure; the carbon crystallises out, not as\r\nblack-lead or charcoal-powder, but as small diamonds. So much has been\r\nknown to chemists for years, but no one yet had hit upon exactly the\r\nright flux in which to melt up the carbon, or exactly the right\r\npressure for the best results. Consequently the diamonds made by\r\nchemists are small and dark, and worthless as jewels. Now I, you know,\r\nhave given up my life to this problem—given my life to it.\r\n\r\n“I began to work at the conditions of diamond making when I was\r\nseventeen, and now I am thirty-two. It seemed to me that it might take\r\nall the thought and energies of a man for ten years, or twenty years,\r\nbut, even if it did, the game was still worth the candle. Suppose one\r\nto have at last just hit the right trick before the secret got out and\r\ndiamonds became as common as coal, one might realize millions.\r\nMillions!”\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked for my sympathy. His eyes shone hungrily. “To\r\nthink,” said he, “that I am on the verge of it all, and here!\r\n\r\n“I had,” he proceeded, “about a thousand pounds when I was twenty-one,\r\nand this, I thought, eked out by a little teaching, would keep my\r\nresearches going. A year or two was spent in study, at Berlin chiefly,\r\nand then I continued on my own account. The trouble was the secrecy.\r\nYou see, if once I had let out what I was doing, other men might have\r\nbeen spurred on by my belief in the practicability of the idea; and I\r\ndo not pretend to be such a genius as to have been sure of coming in\r\nfirst, in the case of a race for the discovery. And you see it was\r\nimportant that if I really meant to make a pile, people should not know\r\nit was an artificial process and capable of turning out diamonds by the\r\nton. So I had to work all alone. At first I had a little laboratory,\r\nbut as my resources began to run out I had to conduct my experiments in\r\na wretched unfurnished room in Kentish Town, where I slept at last on a\r\nstraw mattress on the floor among all my apparatus. The money simply\r\nflowed away. I grudged myself everything except scientific appliances.\r\nI tried to keep things going by a little teaching, but I am not a very\r\ngood teacher, and I have no university degree, nor very much education\r\nexcept in chemistry, and I found I had to give a lot of time and labour\r\nfor precious little money. But I got nearer and nearer the thing. Three\r\nyears ago I settled the problem of the composition of the flux, and got\r\nnear the pressure by putting this flux of mine and a certain carbon\r\ncomposition into a closed-up gun-barrel, filling up with water, sealing\r\ntightly, and heating.”\r\n\r\nHe paused.\r\n\r\n“Rather risky,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Yes. It burst, and smashed all my windows and a lot of my apparatus;\r\nbut I got a kind of diamond powder nevertheless. Following out the\r\nproblem of getting a big pressure upon the molten mixture from which\r\nthe things were to crystallise, I hit upon some researches of Daubree’s\r\nat the Paris _Laboratorie des Poudres et Salpetres_. He exploded\r\ndynamite in a tightly screwed steel cylinder, too strong to burst, and\r\nI found he could crush rocks into a muck not unlike the South African\r\nbed in which diamonds are found. It was a tremendous strain on my\r\nresources, but I got a steel cylinder made for my purpose after his\r\npattern. I put in all my stuff and my explosives, built up a fire in my\r\nfurnace, put the whole concern in, and—went out for a walk.”\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at his matter-of-fact manner. “Did you not\r\nthink it would blow up the house? Were there other people in the\r\nplace?”\r\n\r\n“It was in the interest of science,” he said, ultimately. “There was a\r\ncostermonger family on the floor below, a begging-letter writer in the\r\nroom behind mine, and two flower-women were upstairs. Perhaps it was a\r\nbit thoughtless. But possibly some of them were out.\r\n\r\n“When I came back the thing was just where I left it, among the\r\nwhite-hot coals. The explosive hadn’t burst the case. And then I had a\r\nproblem to face. You know time is an important element in\r\ncrystallisation. If you hurry the process the crystals are small—it is\r\nonly by prolonged standing that they grow to any size. I resolved to\r\nlet this apparatus cool for two years, letting the temperature go down\r\nslowly during the time. And I was now quite out of money; and with a\r\nbig fire and the rent of my room, as well as my hunger to satisfy, I\r\nhad scarcely a penny in the world.\r\n\r\n“I can hardly tell you all the shifts I was put to while I was making\r\nthe diamonds. I have sold newspapers, held horses, opened cab-doors.\r\nFor many weeks I addressed envelopes. I had a place as assistant to a\r\nman who owned a barrow, and used to call down one side of the road\r\nwhile he called down the other.\r\n\r\n“Once for a week I had absolutely nothing to do, and I begged. What a\r\nweek that was! One day the fire was going out and I had eaten nothing\r\nall day, and a little chap taking his girl out, gave me sixpence—to\r\nshow off. Thank heaven for vanity! How the fish-shops smelt! But I went\r\nand spent it all on coals, and had the furnace bright red again, and\r\nthen—Well, hunger makes a fool of a man.\r\n\r\n“At last, three weeks ago, I let the fire out. I took my cylinder and\r\nunscrewed it while it was still so hot that it punished my hands, and I\r\nscraped out the crumbling lava-like mass with a chisel, and hammered it\r\ninto a powder upon an iron plate. And I found three big diamonds and\r\nfive small ones. As I sat on the floor hammering, my door opened, and\r\nmy neighbour, the begging-letter writer came in. He was drunk—as he\r\nusually is. ‘Nerchist,’ said he. ‘You’re drunk,’ said I. ‘’Structive\r\nscoundrel,’ said he. ‘Go to your father,’ said I, meaning the Father of\r\nLies. ‘Never you mind,’ said he, and gave me a cunning wink, and\r\nhiccuped, and leaning up against the door, with his other eye against\r\nthe door-post, began to babble of how he had been prying in my room,\r\nand how he had gone to the police that morning, and how they had taken\r\ndown everything he had to say—‘’siffiwas a ge’m,’ said he. Then I\r\nsuddenly realised I was in a hole. Either I should have to tell these\r\npolice my little secret, and get the whole thing blown upon, or be\r\nlagged as an Anarchist. So I went up to my neighbour and took him by\r\nthe collar, and rolled him about a bit, and then I gathered up my\r\ndiamonds and cleared out. The evening newspapers called my den the\r\nKentish Town Bomb Factory. And now I cannot part with the things for\r\nlove or money.\r\n\r\n“If I go in to respectable jewellers they ask me to wait, and go and\r\nwhisper to a clerk to fetch a policeman, and then I say I cannot wait.\r\nAnd I found out a receiver of stolen goods, and he simply stuck to the\r\none I gave him and told me to prosecute if I wanted it back. I am going\r\nabout now with several hundred thousand pounds-worth of diamonds round\r\nmy neck, and without either food or shelter. You are the first person I\r\nhave taken into my confidence. But I like your face and I am\r\nhard-driven.”\r\n\r\nHe looked into my eyes.\r\n\r\n“It would be madness,” said I, “for me to buy a diamond under the\r\ncircumstances. Besides, I do not carry hundreds of pounds about in my\r\npocket. Yet I more than half believe your story. I will, if you like,\r\ndo this: come to my office to-morrow . . . .”\r\n\r\n“You think I am a thief!” said he keenly. “You will tell the police. I\r\nam not coming into a trap.”\r\n\r\n“Somehow I am assured you are no thief. Here is my card. Take that,\r\nanyhow. You need not come to any appointment. Come when you will.”\r\n\r\nHe took the card, and an earnest of my good-will.\r\n\r\n“Think better of it and come,” said I.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head doubtfully. “I will pay back your half-crown with\r\ninterest some day—such interest as will amaze you,” said he. “Anyhow,\r\nyou will keep the secret? . . . . Don’t follow me.”\r\n\r\nHe crossed the road and went into the darkness towards the little steps\r\nunder the archway leading into Essex Street, and I let him go. And that\r\nwas the last I ever saw of him.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I had two letters from him asking me to send bank-notes—not\r\ncheques—to certain addresses. I weighed the matter over and took what I\r\nconceived to be the wisest course. Once he called upon me when I was\r\nout. My urchin described him as a very thin, dirty, and ragged man,\r\nwith a dreadful cough. He left no message. That was the finish of him\r\nso far as my story goes. I wonder sometimes what has become of him. Was\r\nhe an ingenious monomaniac, or a fraudulent dealer in pebbles, or has\r\nhe really made diamonds as he asserted? The latter is just sufficiently\r\ncredible to make me think at times that I have missed the most\r\nbrilliant opportunity of my life. He may of course be dead, and his\r\ndiamonds carelessly thrown aside—one, I repeat, was almost as big as my\r\nthumb. Or he may be still wandering about trying to sell the things. It\r\nis just possible he may yet emerge upon society, and, passing athwart\r\nmy heavens in the serene altitude sacred to the wealthy and the\r\nwell-advertised, reproach me silently for my want of enterprise. I\r\nsometimes think I might at least have risked five pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief attendant of the three dynamos that buzzed and rattled at\r\nCamberwell, and kept the electric railway going, came out of Yorkshire,\r\nand his name was James Holroyd. He was a practical electrician, but\r\nfond of whisky, a heavy red-haired brute with irregular teeth. He\r\ndoubted the existence of the deity, but accepted Carnot’s cycle, and he\r\nhad read Shakespeare and found him weak in chemistry. His helper came\r\nout of the mysterious East, and his name was Azuma-zi. But Holroyd\r\ncalled him Pooh-bah. Holroyd liked a nigger because he would stand\r\nkicking—a habit with Holroyd—and did not pry into the machinery and try\r\nto learn the ways of it. Certain odd possibilities of the negro mind\r\nbrought into abrupt contact with the crown of our civilisation Holroyd\r\nnever fully realised, though just at the end he got some inkling of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTo define Azuma-zi was beyond ethnology. He was, perhaps, more negroid\r\nthan anything else, though his hair was curly rather than frizzy, and\r\nhis nose had a bridge. Moreover, his skin was brown rather than black,\r\nand the whites of his eyes were yellow. His broad cheekbones and narrow\r\nchin gave his face something of the viperine V. His head, too, was\r\nbroad behind, and low and narrow at the forehead, as if his brain had\r\nbeen twisted round in the reverse way to a European’s. He was short of\r\nstature and still shorter of English. In conversation he made numerous\r\nodd noises of no known marketable value, and his infrequent words were\r\ncarved and wrought into heraldic grotesqueness. Holroyd tried to\r\nelucidate his religious beliefs, and—especially after whisky—lectured\r\nto him against superstition and missionaries. Azuma-zi, however,\r\nshirked the discussion of his gods, even though he was kicked for it.\r\n\r\nAzuma-zi had come, clad in white but insufficient raiment, out of the\r\nstokehole of the _Lord Clive_, from the Straits Settlements, and\r\nbeyond, into London. He had heard even in his youth of the greatness\r\nand riches of London, where all the women are white and fair, and even\r\nthe beggars in the streets are white, and he arrived, with newly earned\r\ngold coins in his pocket, to worship at the shrine of civilisation. The\r\nday of his landing was a dismal one; the sky was dun, and a\r\nwind-worried drizzle filtered down to the greasy streets, but he\r\nplunged boldly into the delights of Shadwell, and was presently cast\r\nup, shattered in health, civilised in costume, penniless and, except in\r\nmatters of the direst necessity, practically a dumb animal, to toil for\r\nJames Holroyd and to be bullied by him in the dynamo shed at\r\nCamberwell. And to James Holroyd bullying was a labour of love.\r\n\r\nThere were three dynamos with their engines at Camberwell. The two that\r\nhad been there since the beginning were small machines; the larger one\r\nwas new. The smaller machines made a reasonable noise; their straps\r\nhummed over the drums, every now and then the brushes buzzed and\r\nfizzled, and the air churned steadily, whoo! whoo! whoo! between their\r\npoles. One was loose in its foundations and kept the shed vibrating.\r\nBut the big dynamo drowned these little noises altogether with the\r\nsustained drone of its iron core, which somehow set part of the\r\nironwork humming. The place made the visitor’s head reel with the\r\nthrob, throb, throb of the engines, the rotation of the big wheels, the\r\nspinning ball-valves, the occasional spittings of the steam, and over\r\nall the deep, unceasing, surging note of the big dynamo. This last\r\nnoise was from an engineering point of view a defect, but Azuma-zi\r\naccounted it unto the monster for mightiness and pride.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible we would have the noises of that shed always about\r\nthe reader as he reads, we would tell all our story to such an\r\naccompaniment. It was a steady stream of din, from which the ear picked\r\nout first one thread and then another; there was the intermittent\r\nsnorting, panting, and seething of the steam engines, the suck and thud\r\nof their pistons, the dull beat on the air as the spokes of the great\r\ndriving-wheels came round, a note the leather straps made as they ran\r\ntighter and looser, and a fretful tumult from the dynamos; and over\r\nall, sometimes inaudible, as the ear tired of it, and then creeping\r\nback upon the senses again, was this trombone note of the big machine.\r\nThe floor never felt steady and quiet beneath one’s feet, but quivered\r\nand jarred. It was a confusing, unsteady place, and enough to send\r\nanyone’s thoughts jerking into odd zigzags. And for three months, while\r\nthe big strike of the engineers was in progress, Holroyd, who was a\r\nblackleg, and Azuma-zi, who was a mere black, were never out of the\r\nstir and eddy of it, but slept and fed in the little wooden shanty\r\nbetween the shed and the gates.\r\n\r\nHolroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text of his big machine\r\nsoon after Azuma-zi came. He had to shout to be heard in the din. “Look\r\nat that,” said Holroyd; “where’s your ‘eathen idol to match ‘im?” And\r\nAzuma-zi looked. For a moment Holroyd was inaudible, and then Azuma-zi\r\nheard: “Kill a hundred men. Twelve per cent. on the ordinary shares,”\r\nsaid Holroyd, “and that’s something like a Gord!”\r\n\r\nHolroyd was proud of his big dynamo, and expatiated upon its size and\r\npower to Azuma-zi until heaven knows what odd currents of thought that\r\nand the incessant whirling and shindy set up within the curly black\r\ncranium. He would explain in the most graphic manner the dozen or so\r\nways in which a man might be killed by it, and once he gave Azuma-zi a\r\nshock as a sample of its quality. After that, in the breathing-times of\r\nhis labour—it was heavy labour, being not only his own, but most of\r\nHolroyd’s—Azuma-zi would sit and watch the big machine. Now and then\r\nthe brushes would sparkle and spit blue flashes, at which Holroyd would\r\nswear, but all the rest was as smooth and rhythmic as breathing. The\r\nband ran shouting over the shaft, and ever behind one as one watched\r\nwas the complacent thud of the piston. So it lived all day in this big\r\nairy shed, with him and Holroyd to wait upon it; not prisoned up and\r\nslaving to drive a ship as the other engines he knew—mere captive\r\ndevils of the British Solomon—had been, but a machine enthroned. Those\r\ntwo smaller dynamos, Azuma-zi by force of contrast despised; the large\r\none he privately christened the Lord of the Dynamos. They were fretful\r\nand irregular, but the big dynamo was steady. How great it was! How\r\nserene and easy in its working! Greater and calmer even than the\r\nBuddhas he had seen at Rangoon, and yet not motionless, but living! The\r\ngreat black coils spun, spun, spun, the rings ran round under the\r\nbrushes, and the deep note of its coil steadied the whole. It affected\r\nAzuma-zi queerly.\r\n\r\nAzuma-zi was not fond of labour. He would sit about and watch the Lord\r\nof the Dynamos while Holroyd went away to persuade the yard porter to\r\nget whisky, although his proper place was not in the dynamo shed but\r\nbehind the engines, and, moreover, if Holroyd caught him skulking he\r\ngot hit for it with a rod of stout copper wire. He would go and stand\r\nclose to the colossus and look up at the great leather band running\r\noverhead. There was a black patch on the band that came round, and it\r\npleased him somehow among all the clatter to watch this return again\r\nand again. Odd thoughts spun with the whirl of it. Scientific people\r\ntell us that savages give souls to rocks and trees—and a machine is a\r\nthousand times more alive than a rock or a tree. And Azuma-zi was\r\npractically a savage still; the veneer of civilisation lay no deeper\r\nthan his slop suit, his bruises, and the coal grime on his face and\r\nhands. His father before him had worshipped a meteoric stone, kindred\r\nblood it may be had splashed the broad wheels of Juggernaut.\r\n\r\nHe took every opportunity Holroyd gave him of touching and handling the\r\ngreat dynamo that was fascinating him. He polished and cleaned it until\r\nthe metal parts were blinding in the sun. He felt a mysterious sense of\r\nservice in doing this. He would go up to it and touch its spinning\r\ncoils gently. The gods he had worshipped were all far away. The people\r\nin London hid their gods.\r\n\r\nAt last his dim feelings grew more distinct, and took shape in thoughts\r\nand at last in acts. When he came into the roaring shed one morning he\r\nsalaamed to the Lord of the Dynamos, and then when Holroyd was away, he\r\nwent and whispered to the thundering machine that he was its servant,\r\nand prayed it to have pity on him and save him from Holroyd. As he did\r\nso a rare gleam of light came in through the open archway of the\r\nthrobbing machine-shed, and the Lord of the Dynamos, as he whirled and\r\nroared, was radiant with pale gold. Then Azuma-zi knew that his service\r\nwas acceptable to his Lord. After that he did not feel so lonely as he\r\nhad done, and he had indeed been very much alone in London. And even\r\nwhen his work time was over, which was rare, he loitered about the\r\nshed.\r\n\r\nThen, the next time Holroyd maltreated him, Azuma-zi went presently to\r\nthe Lord of the Dynamos and whispered, “Thou seest, O my Lord!” and the\r\nangry whir of the machinery seemed to answer him. Thereafter it\r\nappeared to him that whenever Holroyd came into the shed a different\r\nnote came into the sounds of the dynamo. “My Lord bides his time,” said\r\nAzuma-zi to himself. “The iniquity of the fool is not yet ripe.” And he\r\nwaited and watched for the day of reckoning. One day there was evidence\r\nof short circuiting, and Holroyd, making an unwary examination—it was\r\nin the afternoon—got a rather severe shock. Azuma-zi from behind the\r\nengine saw him jump off and curse at the peccant coil.\r\n\r\n“He is warned,” said Azuma-zi to himself. “Surely my Lord is very\r\npatient.”\r\n\r\nHolroyd had at first initiated his “nigger” into such elementary\r\nconceptions of the dynamo’s working as would enable him to take\r\ntemporary charge of the shed in his absence. But when he noticed the\r\nmanner in which Azuma-zi hung about the monster he became suspicious.\r\nHe dimly perceived his assistant was “up to something,” and connecting\r\nhim with the anointing of the coils with oil that had rotted the\r\nvarnish in one place, he issued an edict, shouted above the confusion\r\nof the machinery, “Don’t ‘ee go nigh that big dynamo any more,\r\nPooh-bah, or a’ll take thy skin off!” Besides, if it pleased Azuma-zi\r\nto be near the big machine, it was plain sense and decency to keep him\r\naway from it.\r\n\r\nAzuma-zi obeyed at the time, but later he was caught bowing before the\r\nLord of the Dynamos. At which Holroyd twisted his arm and kicked him as\r\nhe turned to go away. As Azuma-zi presently stood behind the engine and\r\nglared at the back of the hated Holroyd, the noises of the machinery\r\ntook a new rhythm, and sounded like four words in his native tongue.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say exactly what madness is. I fancy Azuma-zi was mad.\r\nThe incessant din and whirl of the dynamo shed may have churned up his\r\nlittle store of knowledge and his big store of superstitious fancy, at\r\nlast, into something akin to frenzy. At any rate, when the idea of\r\nmaking Holroyd a sacrifice to the Dynamo Fetich was thus suggested to\r\nhim, it filled him with a strange tumult of exultant emotion.\r\n\r\nThat night the two men and their black shadows were alone in the shed\r\ntogether. The shed was lit with one big arc light that winked and\r\nflickered purple. The shadows lay black behind the dynamos, the ball\r\ngovernors of the engines whirled from light to darkness, and their\r\npistons beat loud and steady. The world outside seen through the open\r\nend of the shed seemed incredibly dim and remote. It seemed absolutely\r\nsilent, too, since the riot of the machinery drowned every external\r\nsound. Far away was the black fence of the yard with grey shadowy\r\nhouses behind, and above was the deep blue sky and the pale little\r\nstars. Azuma-zi suddenly walked across the centre of the shed above\r\nwhich the leather bands were running, and went into the shadow by the\r\nbig dynamo. Holroyd heard a click, and the spin of the armature\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n“What are you dewin’ with that switch?” he bawled in surprise. “Han’t I\r\ntold you—”\r\n\r\nThen he saw the set expression of Azuma-zi’s eyes as the Asiatic came\r\nout of the shadow towards him.\r\n\r\nIn another moment the two men were grappling fiercely in front of the\r\ngreat dynamo.\r\n\r\n“You coffee-headed fool!” gasped Holroyd, with a brown hand at his\r\nthroat. “Keep off those contact rings.” In another moment he was\r\ntripped and reeling back upon the Lord of the Dynamos. He instinctively\r\nloosened his grip upon his antagonist to save himself from the machine.\r\n\r\nThe messenger, sent in furious haste from the station to find out what\r\nhad happened in the dynamo shed, met Azuma-zi at the porter’s lodge by\r\nthe gate. Azuma-zi tried to explain something, but the messenger could\r\nmake nothing of the black’s incoherent English, and hurried on to the\r\nshed. The machines were all noisily at work, and nothing seemed to be\r\ndisarranged. There was, however, a queer smell of singed hair. Then he\r\nsaw an odd-looking crumpled mass clinging to the front of the big\r\ndynamo, and, approaching, recognised the distorted remains of Holroyd.\r\n\r\nThe man stared and hesitated a moment. Then he saw the face, and shut\r\nhis eyes convulsively. He turned on his heel before he opened them, so\r\nthat he should not see Holroyd again, and went out of the shed to get\r\nadvice and help.\r\n\r\nWhen Azuma-zi saw Holroyd die in the grip of the Great Dynamo he had\r\nbeen a little scared about the consequences of his act. Yet he felt\r\nstrangely elated, and knew that the favour of the Lord Dynamo was upon\r\nhim. His plan was already settled when he met the man coming from the\r\nstation, and the scientific manager who speedily arrived on the scene\r\njumped at the obvious conclusion of suicide. This expert scarcely\r\nnoticed Azuma-zi, except to ask a few questions. Did he see Holroyd\r\nkill himself? Azuma-zi explained that he had been out of sight at the\r\nengine furnace until he heard a difference in the noise from the\r\ndynamo. It was not a difficult examination, being untinctured by\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nThe distorted remains of Holroyd, which the electrician removed from\r\nthe machine, were hastily covered by the porter with a coffee-stained\r\ntablecloth. Somebody, by a happy inspiration, fetched a medical man.\r\nThe expert was chiefly anxious to get the machine at work again, for\r\nseven or eight trains had stopped midway in the stuffy tunnels of the\r\nelectric railway. Azuma-zi, answering or misunderstanding the questions\r\nof the people who had by authority or impudence come into the shed, was\r\npresently sent back to the stoke-hole by the scientific manager. Of\r\ncourse a crowd collected outside the gates of the yard—a crowd, for no\r\nknown reason, always hovers for a day or two near the scene of a sudden\r\ndeath in London; two or three reporters percolated somehow into the\r\nengine-shed, and one even got to Azuma-zi; but the scientific expert\r\ncleared them out again, being himself an amateur journalist.\r\n\r\nPresently the body was carried away, and public interest departed with\r\nit. Azuma-zi remained very quietly at his furnace, seeing over and over\r\nagain in the coals a figure that wriggled violently and became still.\r\nAn hour after the murder, to anyone coming into the shed it would have\r\nlooked exactly as if nothing had ever happened there. Peeping presently\r\nfrom his engine-room the black saw the Lord Dynamo spin and whirl\r\nbeside his little brothers, and the driving wheels were beating round,\r\nand the steam in the pistons went thud, thud, exactly as it had been\r\nearlier in the evening. After all, from the mechanical point of view,\r\nit had been a most insignificant incident—the mere temporary deflection\r\nof a current. But now the slender form and slender shadow of the\r\nscientific manager replaced the sturdy outline of Holroyd travelling up\r\nand down the lane of light upon the vibrating floor under the straps\r\nbetween the engines and the dynamos.\r\n\r\n“Have I not served my Lord?” said Azuma-zi inaudibly, from his shadow,\r\nand the note of the great dynamo rang out full and clear. As he looked\r\nat the big whirling mechanism the strange fascination of it that had\r\nbeen a little in abeyance since Holroyd’s death, resumed its sway.\r\n\r\nNever had Azuma-zi seen a man killed so swiftly and pitilessly. The big\r\nhumming machine had slain its victim without wavering for a second from\r\nits steady beating. It was indeed a mighty god.\r\n\r\nThe unconscious scientific manager stood with his back to him,\r\nscribbling on a piece of paper. His shadow lay at the foot of the\r\nmonster.\r\n\r\n“Was the Lord Dynamo still hungry? His servant was ready.”\r\n\r\nAzuma-zi made a stealthy step forward; then stopped. The scientific\r\nmanager suddenly stopped writing, and walked down the shed to the\r\nendmost of the dynamos, and began to examine the brushes.\r\n\r\nAzuma-zi hesitated, and then slipped across noiselessly into shadow by\r\nthe switch. There he waited. Presently the manager’s footsteps could be\r\nheard returning. He stopped in his old position, unconscious of the\r\nstoker crouching ten feet away from him. Then the big dynamo suddenly\r\nfizzled, and in another moment Azuma-zi had sprung out of the darkness\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nFirst, the scientific manager was gripped round the body and swung\r\ntowards the big dynamo, then, kicking with his knee and forcing his\r\nantagonist’s head down with his hands, he loosened the grip on his\r\nwaist and swung round away from the machine. Then the black grasped him\r\nagain, putting a curly head against his chest, and they swayed and\r\npanted as it seemed for an age or so. Then the scientific manager was\r\nimpelled to catch a black ear in his teeth and bite furiously. The\r\nblack yelled hideously.\r\n\r\nThey rolled over on the floor, and the black, who had apparently\r\nslipped from the vice of the teeth or parted with some ear—the\r\nscientific manager wondered which at the time—tried to throttle him.\r\nThe scientific manager was making some ineffectual attempts to claw\r\nsomething with his hands and to kick, when the welcome sound of quick\r\nfootsteps sounded on the floor. The next moment Azuma-zi had left him\r\nand darted towards the big dynamo. There was a splutter amid the roar.\r\n\r\nThe officer of the company who had entered, stood staring as Azuma-zi\r\ncaught the naked terminals in his hands, gave one horrible convulsion,\r\nand then hung motionless from the machine, his face violently\r\ndistorted.\r\n\r\n“I’m jolly glad you came in when you did,” said the scientific manager,\r\nstill sitting on the floor.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the still quivering figure.\r\n\r\n“It’s not a nice death to die, apparently—but it is quick.”\r\n\r\nThe official was still staring at the body. He was a man of slow\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\nThe scientific manager got up on his feet rather awkwardly. He ran his\r\nfingers along his collar thoughtfully, and moved his head to and fro\r\nseveral times.\r\n\r\n“Poor Holroyd! I see now.” Then almost mechanically he went towards the\r\nswitch in the shadow and turned the current into the railway circuit\r\nagain. As he did so the singed body loosened its grip upon the machine\r\nand fell forward on its face. The core of the dynamo roared out loud\r\nand clear, and the armature beat the air.\r\n\r\nSo ended prematurely the Worship of the Dynamo Deity, perhaps the most\r\nshort-lived of all religions. Yet withal it could at least boast a\r\nMartyrdom and a Human Sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY OF THE BLIND\r\n\r\n\r\nThree hundred miles and more from Chimborazo, one hundred from the\r\nsnows of Cotopaxi, in the wildest wastes of Ecuador’s Andes, there lies\r\nthat mysterious mountain valley, cut off from all the world of men, the\r\nCountry of the Blind. Long years ago that valley lay so far open to the\r\nworld that men might come at last through frightful gorges and over an\r\nicy pass into its equable meadows, and thither indeed men came, a\r\nfamily or so of Peruvian half-breeds fleeing from the lust and tyranny\r\nof an evil Spanish ruler. Then came the stupendous outbreak of\r\nMindobamba, when it was night in Quito for seventeen days, and the\r\nwater was boiling at Yaguachi and all the fish floating dying even as\r\nfar as Guayaquil; everywhere along the Pacific slopes there were\r\nland-slips and swift thawings and sudden floods, and one whole side of\r\nthe old Arauca crest slipped and came down in thunder, and cut off the\r\nCountry of the Blind for ever from the exploring feet of men. But one\r\nof these early settlers had chanced to be on the hither side of the\r\ngorges when the world had so terribly shaken itself, and he perforce\r\nhad to forget his wife and his child and all the friends and\r\npossessions he had left up there, and start life over again in the\r\nlower world. He started it again but ill, blindness overtook him, and\r\nhe died of punishment in the mines; but the story he told begot a\r\nlegend that lingers along the length of the Cordilleras of the Andes to\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\nHe told of his reason for venturing back from that fastness, into which\r\nhe had first been carried lashed to a llama, beside a vast bale of\r\ngear, when he was a child. The valley, he said, had in it all that the\r\nheart of man could desire—sweet water, pasture, an even climate, slopes\r\nof rich brown soil with tangles of a shrub that bore an excellent\r\nfruit, and on one side great hanging forests of pine that held the\r\navalanches high. Far overhead, on three sides, vast cliffs of\r\ngrey-green rock were capped by cliffs of ice; but the glacier stream\r\ncame not to them, but flowed away by the farther slopes, and only now\r\nand then huge ice masses fell on the valley side. In this valley it\r\nneither rained nor snowed, but the abundant springs gave a rich green\r\npasture, that irrigation would spread over all the valley space. The\r\nsettlers did well indeed there. Their beasts did well and multiplied,\r\nand but one thing marred their happiness. Yet it was enough to mar it\r\ngreatly. A strange disease had come upon them and had made all the\r\nchildren born to them there—and, indeed, several older children\r\nalso—blind. It was to seek some charm or antidote against this plague\r\nof blindness that he had with fatigue and danger and difficulty\r\nreturned down the gorge. In those days, in such cases, men did not\r\nthink of germs and infections, but of sins, and it seemed to him that\r\nthe reason of this affliction must lie in the negligence of these\r\npriestless immigrants to set up a shrine so soon as they entered the\r\nvalley. He wanted a shrine—a handsome, cheap, effectual shrine—to be\r\nerected in the valley; he wanted relics and such-like potent things of\r\nfaith, blessed objects and mysterious medals and prayers. In his wallet\r\nhe had a bar of native silver for which he would not account; he\r\ninsisted there was none in the valley with something of the insistence\r\nof an inexpert liar. They had all clubbed their money and ornaments\r\ntogether, having little need for such treasure up there, he said, to\r\nbuy them holy help against their ill. I figure this dim-eyed young\r\nmountaineer, sunburnt, gaunt, and anxious, hat brim clutched\r\nfeverishly, a man all unused to the ways of the lower world, telling\r\nthis story to some keen-eyed, attentive priest before the great\r\nconvulsion; I can picture him presently seeking to return with pious\r\nand infallible remedies against that trouble, and the infinite dismay\r\nwith which he must have faced the tumbled vastness where the gorge had\r\nonce come out. But the rest of his story of mischances is lost to me,\r\nsave that I know of his evil death after several years. Poor stray from\r\nthat remoteness! The stream that had once made the gorge now bursts\r\nfrom the mouth of a rocky cave, and the legend his poor, ill-told story\r\nset going developed into the legend of a race of blind men somewhere\r\n“over there” one may still hear to-day.\r\n\r\nAnd amidst the little population of that now isolated and forgotten\r\nvalley the disease ran its course. The old became groping, the young\r\nsaw but dimly, and the children that were born to them never saw at\r\nall. But life was very easy in that snow-rimmed basin, lost to all the\r\nworld, with neither thorns nor briers, with no evil insects nor any\r\nbeasts save the gentle breed of llamas they had lugged and thrust and\r\nfollowed up the beds of the shrunken rivers in the gorges up which they\r\nhad come. The seeing had become purblind so gradually that they\r\nscarcely noticed their loss. They guided the sightless youngsters\r\nhither and thither until they knew the whole valley marvellously, and\r\nwhen at last sight died out among them the race lived on. They had even\r\ntime to adapt themselves to the blind control of fire, which they made\r\ncarefully in stoves of stone. They were a simple strain of people at\r\nthe first, unlettered, only slightly touched with the Spanish\r\ncivilisation, but with something of a tradition of the arts of old Peru\r\nand of its lost philosophy. Generation followed generation. They forgot\r\nmany things; they devised many things. Their tradition of the greater\r\nworld they came from became mythical in colour and uncertain. In all\r\nthings save sight they were strong and able, and presently chance sent\r\none who had an original mind and who could talk and persuade among\r\nthem, and then afterwards another. These two passed, leaving their\r\neffects, and the little community grew in numbers and in understanding,\r\nand met and settled social and economic problems that arose. Generation\r\nfollowed generation. Generation followed generation. There came a time\r\nwhen a child was born who was fifteen generations from that ancestor\r\nwho went out of the valley with a bar of silver to seek God’s aid, and\r\nwho never returned. Thereabout it chanced that a man came into this\r\ncommunity from the outer world. And this is the story of that man.\r\n\r\nHe was a mountaineer from the country near Quito, a man who had been\r\ndown to the sea and had seen the world, a reader of books in an\r\noriginal way, an acute and enterprising man, and he was taken on by a\r\nparty of Englishmen who had come out to Ecuador to climb mountains, to\r\nreplace one of their three Swiss guides who had fallen ill. He climbed\r\nhere and he climbed there, and then came the attempt on Parascotopetl,\r\nthe Matterhorn of the Andes, in which he was lost to the outer world.\r\nThe story of that accident has been written a dozen times. Pointer’s\r\nnarrative is the best. He tells how the little party worked their\r\ndifficult and almost vertical way up to the very foot of the last and\r\ngreatest precipice, and how they built a night shelter amidst the snow\r\nupon a little shelf of rock, and, with a touch of real dramatic power,\r\nhow presently they found Nunez had gone from them. They shouted, and\r\nthere was no reply; shouted and whistled, and for the rest of that\r\nnight they slept no more.\r\n\r\nAs the morning broke they saw the traces of his fall. It seems\r\nimpossible he could have uttered a sound. He had slipped eastward\r\ntowards the unknown side of the mountain; far below he had struck a\r\nsteep slope of snow, and ploughed his way down it in the midst of a\r\nsnow avalanche. His track went straight to the edge of a frightful\r\nprecipice, and beyond that everything was hidden. Far, far below, and\r\nhazy with distance, they could see trees rising out of a narrow,\r\nshut-in valley—the lost Country of the Blind. But they did not know it\r\nwas the lost Country of the Blind, nor distinguish it in any way from\r\nany other narrow streak of upland valley. Unnerved by this disaster,\r\nthey abandoned their attempt in the afternoon, and Pointer was called\r\naway to the war before he could make another attack. To this day\r\nParascotopetl lifts an unconquered crest, and Pointer’s shelter\r\ncrumbles unvisited amidst the snows.\r\n\r\nAnd the man who fell survived.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the slope he fell a thousand feet, and came down in the\r\nmidst of a cloud of snow upon a snow-slope even steeper than the one\r\nabove. Down this he was whirled, stunned and insensible, but without a\r\nbone broken in his body; and then at last came to gentler slopes, and\r\nat last rolled out and lay still, buried amidst a softening heap of the\r\nwhite masses that had accompanied and saved him. He came to himself\r\nwith a dim fancy that he was ill in bed; then realized his position\r\nwith a mountaineer’s intelligence and worked himself loose and, after a\r\nrest or so, out until he saw the stars. He rested flat upon his chest\r\nfor a space, wondering where he was and what had happened to him. He\r\nexplored his limbs, and discovered that several of his buttons were\r\ngone and his coat turned over his head. His knife had gone from his\r\npocket and his hat was lost, though he had tied it under his chin. He\r\nrecalled that he had been looking for loose stones to raise his piece\r\nof the shelter wall. His ice-axe had disappeared.\r\n\r\nHe decided he must have fallen, and looked up to see, exaggerated by\r\nthe ghastly light of the rising moon, the tremendous flight he had\r\ntaken. For a while he lay, gazing blankly at the vast, pale cliff\r\ntowering above, rising moment by moment out of a subsiding tide of\r\ndarkness. Its phantasmal, mysterious beauty held him for a space, and\r\nthen he was seized with a paroxysm of sobbing laughter . . . .\r\n\r\nAfter a great interval of time he became aware that he was near the\r\nlower edge of the snow. Below, down what was now a moon-lit and\r\npracticable slope, he saw the dark and broken appearance of rock-strewn\r\nturf. He struggled to his feet, aching in every joint and limb, got\r\ndown painfully from the heaped loose snow about him, went downward\r\nuntil he was on the turf, and there dropped rather than lay beside a\r\nboulder, drank deep from the flask in his inner pocket, and instantly\r\nfell asleep . . . .\r\n\r\nHe was awakened by the singing of birds in the trees far below.\r\n\r\nHe sat up and perceived he was on a little alp at the foot of a vast\r\nprecipice that sloped only a little in the gully down which he and his\r\nsnow had come. Over against him another wall of rock reared itself\r\nagainst the sky. The gorge between these precipices ran east and west\r\nand was full of the morning sunlight, which lit to the westward the\r\nmass of fallen mountain that closed the descending gorge. Below him it\r\nseemed there was a precipice equally steep, but behind the snow in the\r\ngully he found a sort of chimney-cleft dripping with snow-water, down\r\nwhich a desperate man might venture. He found it easier than it seemed,\r\nand came at last to another desolate alp, and then after a rock climb\r\nof no particular difficulty, to a steep slope of trees. He took his\r\nbearings and turned his face up the gorge, for he saw it opened out\r\nabove upon green meadows, among which he now glimpsed quite distinctly\r\na cluster of stone huts of unfamiliar fashion. At times his progress\r\nwas like clambering along the face of a wall, and after a time the\r\nrising sun ceased to strike along the gorge, the voices of the singing\r\nbirds died away, and the air grew cold and dark about him. But the\r\ndistant valley with its houses was all the brighter for that. He came\r\npresently to talus, and among the rocks he noted—for he was an\r\nobservant man—an unfamiliar fern that seemed to clutch out of the\r\ncrevices with intense green hands. He picked a frond or so and gnawed\r\nits stalk, and found it helpful.\r\n\r\nAbout midday he came at last out of the throat of the gorge into the\r\nplain and the sunlight. He was stiff and weary; he sat down in the\r\nshadow of a rock, filled up his flask with water from a spring and\r\ndrank it down, and remained for a time, resting before he went on to\r\nthe houses.\r\n\r\nThey were very strange to his eyes, and indeed the whole aspect of that\r\nvalley became, as he regarded it, queerer and more unfamiliar. The\r\ngreater part of its surface was lush green meadow, starred with many\r\nbeautiful flowers, irrigated with extraordinary care, and bearing\r\nevidence of systematic cropping piece by piece. High up and ringing the\r\nvalley about was a wall, and what appeared to be a circumferential\r\nwater channel, from which the little trickles of water that fed the\r\nmeadow plants came, and on the higher slopes above this flocks of\r\nllamas cropped the scanty herbage. Sheds, apparently shelters or\r\nfeeding-places for the llamas, stood against the boundary wall here and\r\nthere. The irrigation streams ran together into a main channel down the\r\ncentre of the valley, and this was enclosed on either side by a wall\r\nbreast high. This gave a singularly urban quality to this secluded\r\nplace, a quality that was greatly enhanced by the fact that a number of\r\npaths paved with black and white stones, and each with a curious little\r\nkerb at the side, ran hither and thither in an orderly manner. The\r\nhouses of the central village were quite unlike the casual and\r\nhiggledy-piggledy agglomeration of the mountain villages he knew; they\r\nstood in a continuous row on either side of a central street of\r\nastonishing cleanness, here and there their parti-coloured facade was\r\npierced by a door, and not a solitary window broke their even frontage.\r\nThey were parti-coloured with extraordinary irregularity, smeared with\r\na sort of plaster that was sometimes grey, sometimes drab, sometimes\r\nslate-coloured or dark brown; and it was the sight of this wild\r\nplastering first brought the word “blind” into the thoughts of the\r\nexplorer. “The good man who did that,” he thought, “must have been as\r\nblind as a bat.”\r\n\r\nHe descended a steep place, and so came to the wall and channel that\r\nran about the valley, near where the latter spouted out its surplus\r\ncontents into the deeps of the gorge in a thin and wavering thread of\r\ncascade. He could now see a number of men and women resting on piled\r\nheaps of grass, as if taking a siesta, in the remoter part of the\r\nmeadow, and nearer the village a number of recumbent children, and then\r\nnearer at hand three men carrying pails on yokes along a little path\r\nthat ran from the encircling wall towards the houses. These latter were\r\nclad in garments of llama cloth and boots and belts of leather, and\r\nthey wore caps of cloth with back and ear flaps. They followed one\r\nanother in single file, walking slowly and yawning as they walked, like\r\nmen who have been up all night. There was something so reassuringly\r\nprosperous and respectable in their bearing that after a moment’s\r\nhesitation Nunez stood forward as conspicuously as possible upon his\r\nrock, and gave vent to a mighty shout that echoed round the valley.\r\n\r\nThe three men stopped, and moved their heads as though they were\r\nlooking about them. They turned their faces this way and that, and\r\nNunez gesticulated with freedom. But they did not appear to see him for\r\nall his gestures, and after a time, directing themselves towards the\r\nmountains far away to the right, they shouted as if in answer. Nunez\r\nbawled again, and then once more, and as he gestured ineffectually the\r\nword “blind” came up to the top of his thoughts. “The fools must be\r\nblind,” he said.\r\n\r\nWhen at last, after much shouting and wrath, Nunez crossed the stream\r\nby a little bridge, came through a gate in the wall, and approached\r\nthem, he was sure that they were blind. He was sure that this was the\r\nCountry of the Blind of which the legends told. Conviction had sprung\r\nupon him, and a sense of great and rather enviable adventure. The three\r\nstood side by side, not looking at him, but with their ears directed\r\ntowards him, judging him by his unfamiliar steps. They stood close\r\ntogether like men a little afraid, and he could see their eyelids\r\nclosed and sunken, as though the very balls beneath had shrunk away.\r\nThere was an expression near awe on their faces.\r\n\r\n“A man,” one said, in hardly recognisable Spanish. “A man it is—a man\r\nor a spirit—coming down from the rocks.”\r\n\r\nBut Nunez advanced with the confident steps of a youth who enters upon\r\nlife. All the old stories of the lost valley and the Country of the\r\nBlind had come back to his mind, and through his thoughts ran this old\r\nproverb, as if it were a refrain:—\r\n\r\n“In the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man is King.”\r\n\r\n“In the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man is King.”\r\n\r\nAnd very civilly he gave them greeting. He talked to them and used his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“Where does he come from, brother Pedro?” asked one.\r\n\r\n“Down out of the rocks.”\r\n\r\n“Over the mountains I come,” said Nunez, “out of the country beyond\r\nthere—where men can see. From near Bogota—where there are a hundred\r\nthousands of people, and where the city passes out of sight.”\r\n\r\n“Sight?” muttered Pedro. “Sight?”\r\n\r\n“He comes,” said the second blind man, “out of the rocks.”\r\n\r\nThe cloth of their coats, Nunez saw was curious fashioned, each with a\r\ndifferent sort of stitching.\r\n\r\nThey startled him by a simultaneous movement towards him, each with a\r\nhand outstretched. He stepped back from the advance of these spread\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n“Come hither,” said the third blind man, following his motion and\r\nclutching him neatly.\r\n\r\nAnd they held Nunez and felt him over, saying no word further until\r\nthey had done so.\r\n\r\n“Carefully,” he cried, with a finger in his eye, and found they thought\r\nthat organ, with its fluttering lids, a queer thing in him. They went\r\nover it again.\r\n\r\n“A strange creature, Correa,” said the one called Pedro. “Feel the\r\ncoarseness of his hair. Like a llama’s hair.”\r\n\r\n“Rough he is as the rocks that begot him,” said Correa, investigating\r\nNunez’s unshaven chin with a soft and slightly moist hand. “Perhaps he\r\nwill grow finer.”\r\n\r\nNunez struggled a little under their examination, but they gripped him\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\n“Carefully,” he said again.\r\n\r\n“He speaks,” said the third man. “Certainly he is a man.”\r\n\r\n“Ugh!” said Pedro, at the roughness of his coat.\r\n\r\n“And you have come into the world?” asked Pedro.\r\n\r\n“_Out_ of the world. Over mountains and glaciers; right over above\r\nthere, half-way to the sun. Out of the great, big world that goes down,\r\ntwelve days’ journey to the sea.”\r\n\r\nThey scarcely seemed to heed him. “Our fathers have told us men may be\r\nmade by the forces of Nature,” said Correa. “It is the warmth of\r\nthings, and moisture, and rottenness—rottenness.”\r\n\r\n“Let us lead him to the elders,” said Pedro.\r\n\r\n“Shout first,” said Correa, “lest the children be afraid. This is a\r\nmarvellous occasion.”\r\n\r\nSo they shouted, and Pedro went first and took Nunez by the hand to\r\nlead him to the houses.\r\n\r\nHe drew his hand away. “I can see,” he said.\r\n\r\n“See?” said Correa.\r\n\r\n“Yes; see,” said Nunez, turning towards him, and stumbled against\r\nPedro’s pail.\r\n\r\n“His senses are still imperfect,” said the third blind man. “He\r\nstumbles, and talks unmeaning words. Lead him by the hand.”\r\n\r\n“As you will,” said Nunez, and was led along laughing.\r\n\r\nIt seemed they knew nothing of sight.\r\n\r\nWell, all in good time he would teach them.\r\n\r\nHe heard people shouting, and saw a number of figures gathering\r\ntogether in the middle roadway of the village.\r\n\r\nHe found it tax his nerve and patience more than he had anticipated,\r\nthat first encounter with the population of the Country of the Blind.\r\nThe place seemed larger as he drew near to it, and the smeared\r\nplasterings queerer, and a crowd of children and men and women (the\r\nwomen and girls he was pleased to note had, some of them, quite sweet\r\nfaces, for all that their eyes were shut and sunken) came about him,\r\nholding on to him, touching him with soft, sensitive hands, smelling at\r\nhim, and listening at every word he spoke. Some of the maidens and\r\nchildren, however, kept aloof as if afraid, and indeed his voice seemed\r\ncoarse and rude beside their softer notes. They mobbed him. His three\r\nguides kept close to him with an effect of proprietorship, and said\r\nagain and again, “A wild man out of the rocks.”\r\n\r\n“Bogota,” he said. “Bogota. Over the mountain crests.”\r\n\r\n“A wild man—using wild words,” said Pedro. “Did you hear that—\r\n\r\n“_Bogota?_ His mind has hardly formed yet. He has only the beginnings\r\nof speech.”\r\n\r\nA little boy nipped his hand. “Bogota!” he said mockingly.\r\n\r\n“Aye! A city to your village. I come from the great world—where men\r\nhave eyes and see.”\r\n\r\n“His name’s Bogota,” they said.\r\n\r\n“He stumbled,” said Correa—“stumbled twice as we came hither.”\r\n\r\n“Bring him in to the elders.”\r\n\r\nAnd they thrust him suddenly through a doorway into a room as black as\r\npitch, save at the end there faintly glowed a fire. The crowd closed in\r\nbehind him and shut out all but the faintest glimmer of day, and before\r\nhe could arrest himself he had fallen headlong over the feet of a\r\nseated man. His arm, outflung, struck the face of someone else as he\r\nwent down; he felt the soft impact of features and heard a cry of\r\nanger, and for a moment he struggled against a number of hands that\r\nclutched him. It was a one-sided fight. An inkling of the situation\r\ncame to him and he lay quiet.\r\n\r\n“I fell down,” he said; “I couldn’t see in this pitchy darkness.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause as if the unseen persons about him tried to\r\nunderstand his words. Then the voice of Correa said: “He is but newly\r\nformed. He stumbles as he walks and mingles words that mean nothing\r\nwith his speech.”\r\n\r\nOthers also said things about him that he heard or understood\r\nimperfectly.\r\n\r\n“May I sit up?” he asked, in a pause. “I will not struggle against you\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nThey consulted and let him rise.\r\n\r\nThe voice of an older man began to question him, and Nunez found\r\nhimself trying to explain the great world out of which he had fallen,\r\nand the sky and mountains and such-like marvels, to these elders who\r\nsat in darkness in the Country of the Blind. And they would believe and\r\nunderstand nothing whatever that he told them, a thing quite outside\r\nhis expectation. They would not even understand many of his words. For\r\nfourteen generations these people had been blind and cut off from all\r\nthe seeing world; the names for all the things of sight had faded and\r\nchanged; the story of the outer world was faded and changed to a\r\nchild’s story; and they had ceased to concern themselves with anything\r\nbeyond the rocky slopes above their circling wall. Blind men of genius\r\nhad arisen among them and questioned the shreds of belief and tradition\r\nthey had brought with them from their seeing days, and had dismissed\r\nall these things as idle fancies and replaced them with new and saner\r\nexplanations. Much of their imagination had shrivelled with their eyes,\r\nand they had made for themselves new imaginations with their ever more\r\nsensitive ears and finger-tips. Slowly Nunez realised this: that his\r\nexpectation of wonder and reverence at his origin and his gifts was not\r\nto be borne out; and after his poor attempt to explain sight to them\r\nhad been set aside as the confused version of a new-made being\r\ndescribing the marvels of his incoherent sensations, he subsided, a\r\nlittle dashed, into listening to their instruction. And the eldest of\r\nthe blind men explained to him life and philosophy and religion, how\r\nthat the world (meaning their valley) had been first an empty hollow in\r\nthe rocks, and then had come first inanimate things without the gift of\r\ntouch, and llamas and a few other creatures that had little sense, and\r\nthen men, and at last angels, whom one could hear singing and making\r\nfluttering sounds, but whom no one could touch at all, which puzzled\r\nNunez greatly until he thought of the birds.\r\n\r\nHe went on to tell Nunez how this time had been divided into the warm\r\nand the cold, which are the blind equivalents of day and night, and how\r\nit was good to sleep in the warm and work during the cold, so that now,\r\nbut for his advent, the whole town of the blind would have been asleep.\r\nHe said Nunez must have been specially created to learn and serve the\r\nwisdom they had acquired, and that for all his mental incoherency and\r\nstumbling behaviour he must have courage and do his best to learn, and\r\nat that all the people in the door-way murmured encouragingly. He said\r\nthe night—for the blind call their day night—was now far gone, and it\r\nbehooved everyone to go back to sleep. He asked Nunez if he knew how to\r\nsleep, and Nunez said he did, but that before sleep he wanted food.\r\nThey brought him food, llama’s milk in a bowl and rough salted bread,\r\nand led him into a lonely place to eat out of their hearing, and\r\nafterwards to slumber until the chill of the mountain evening roused\r\nthem to begin their day again. But Nunez slumbered not at all.\r\n\r\nInstead, he sat up in the place where they had left him, resting his\r\nlimbs and turning the unanticipated circumstances of his arrival over\r\nand over in his mind.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then he laughed, sometimes with amusement and sometimes\r\nwith indignation.\r\n\r\n“Unformed mind!” he said. “Got no senses yet! They little know they’ve\r\nbeen insulting their Heaven-sent King and master . . . . .\r\n\r\n“I see I must bring them to reason.\r\n\r\n“Let me think.\r\n\r\n“Let me think.”\r\n\r\nHe was still thinking when the sun set.\r\n\r\nNunez had an eye for all beautiful things, and it seemed to him that\r\nthe glow upon the snow-fields and glaciers that rose about the valley\r\non every side was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. His eyes\r\nwent from that inaccessible glory to the village and irrigated fields,\r\nfast sinking into the twilight, and suddenly a wave of emotion took\r\nhim, and he thanked God from the bottom of his heart that the power of\r\nsight had been given him.\r\n\r\nHe heard a voice calling to him from out of the village.\r\n\r\n“Yaho there, Bogota! Come hither!”\r\n\r\nAt that he stood up, smiling. He would show these people once and for\r\nall what sight would do for a man. They would seek him, but not find\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“You move not, Bogota,” said the voice.\r\n\r\nHe laughed noiselessly and made two stealthy steps aside from the path.\r\n\r\n“Trample not on the grass, Bogota; that is not allowed.”\r\n\r\nNunez had scarcely heard the sound he made himself. He stopped, amazed.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the voice came running up the piebald path towards him.\r\n\r\nHe stepped back into the pathway. “Here I am,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Why did you not come when I called you?” said the blind man. “Must you\r\nbe led like a child? Cannot you hear the path as you walk?”\r\n\r\nNunez laughed. “I can see it,” he said.\r\n\r\n“There is no such word as _see_,” said the blind man, after a pause.\r\n“Cease this folly and follow the sound of my feet.”\r\n\r\nNunez followed, a little annoyed.\r\n\r\n“My time will come,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You’ll learn,” the blind man answered. “There is much to learn in the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n“Has no one told you, ‘In the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man is\r\nKing?’”\r\n\r\n“What is blind?” asked the blind man, carelessly, over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nFour days passed and the fifth found the King of the Blind still\r\nincognito, as a clumsy and useless stranger among his subjects.\r\n\r\nIt was, he found, much more difficult to proclaim himself than he had\r\nsupposed, and in the meantime, while he meditated his _coup d’etat_, he\r\ndid what he was told and learnt the manners and customs of the Country\r\nof the Blind. He found working and going about at night a particularly\r\nirksome thing, and he decided that that should be the first thing he\r\nwould change.\r\n\r\nThey led a simple, laborious life, these people, with all the elements\r\nof virtue and happiness as these things can be understood by men. They\r\ntoiled, but not oppressively; they had food and clothing sufficient for\r\ntheir needs; they had days and seasons of rest; they made much of music\r\nand singing, and there was love among them and little children. It was\r\nmarvellous with what confidence and precision they went about their\r\nordered world. Everything, you see, had been made to fit their needs;\r\neach of the radiating paths of the valley area had a constant angle to\r\nthe others, and was distinguished by a special notch upon its kerbing;\r\nall obstacles and irregularities of path or meadow had long since been\r\ncleared away; all their methods and procedure arose naturally from\r\ntheir special needs. Their senses had become marvellously acute; they\r\ncould hear and judge the slightest gesture of a man a dozen paces\r\naway—could hear the very beating of his heart. Intonation had long\r\nreplaced expression with them, and touches gesture, and their work with\r\nhoe and spade and fork was as free and confident as garden work can be.\r\nTheir sense of smell was extraordinarily fine; they could distinguish\r\nindividual differences as readily as a dog can, and they went about the\r\ntending of llamas, who lived among the rocks above and came to the wall\r\nfor food and shelter, with ease and confidence. It was only when at\r\nlast Nunez sought to assert himself that he found how easy and\r\nconfident their movements could be.\r\n\r\nHe rebelled only after he had tried persuasion.\r\n\r\nHe tried at first on several occasions to tell them of sight. “Look you\r\nhere, you people,” he said. “There are things you do not understand in\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nOnce or twice one or two of them attended to him; they sat with faces\r\ndowncast and ears turned intelligently towards him, and he did his best\r\nto tell them what it was to see. Among his hearers was a girl, with\r\neyelids less red and sunken than the others, so that one could almost\r\nfancy she was hiding eyes, whom especially he hoped to persuade. He\r\nspoke of the beauties of sight, of watching the mountains, of the sky\r\nand the sunrise, and they heard him with amused incredulity that\r\npresently became condemnatory. They told him there were indeed no\r\nmountains at all, but that the end of the rocks where the llamas grazed\r\nwas indeed the end of the world; thence sprang a cavernous roof of the\r\nuniverse, from which the dew and the avalanches fell; and when he\r\nmaintained stoutly the world had neither end nor roof such as they\r\nsupposed, they said his thoughts were wicked. So far as he could\r\ndescribe sky and clouds and stars to them it seemed to them a hideous\r\nvoid, a terrible blankness in the place of the smooth roof to things in\r\nwhich they believed—it was an article of faith with them that the\r\ncavern roof was exquisitely smooth to the touch. He saw that in some\r\nmanner he shocked them, and gave up that aspect of the matter\r\naltogether, and tried to show them the practical value of sight. One\r\nmorning he saw Pedro in the path called Seventeen and coming towards\r\nthe central houses, but still too far off for hearing or scent, and he\r\ntold them as much. “In a little while,” he prophesied, “Pedro will be\r\nhere.” An old man remarked that Pedro had no business on path\r\nSeventeen, and then, as if in confirmation, that individual as he drew\r\nnear turned and went transversely into path Ten, and so back with\r\nnimble paces towards the outer wall. They mocked Nunez when Pedro did\r\nnot arrive, and afterwards, when he asked Pedro questions to clear his\r\ncharacter, Pedro denied and outfaced him, and was afterwards hostile to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThen he induced them to let him go a long way up the sloping meadows\r\ntowards the wall with one complaisant individual, and to him he\r\npromised to describe all that happened among the houses. He noted\r\ncertain goings and comings, but the things that really seemed to\r\nsignify to these people happened inside of or behind the windowless\r\nhouses—the only things they took note of to test him by—and of those he\r\ncould see or tell nothing; and it was after the failure of this\r\nattempt, and the ridicule they could not repress, that he resorted to\r\nforce. He thought of seizing a spade and suddenly smiting one or two of\r\nthem to earth, and so in fair combat showing the advantage of eyes. He\r\nwent so far with that resolution as to seize his spade, and then he\r\ndiscovered a new thing about himself, and that was that it was\r\nimpossible for him to hit a blind man in cold blood.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, and found them all aware that he had snatched up the\r\nspade. They stood all alert, with their heads on one side, and bent\r\nears towards him for what he would do next.\r\n\r\n“Put that spade down,” said one, and he felt a sort of helpless horror.\r\nHe came near obedience.\r\n\r\nThen he had thrust one backwards against a house wall, and fled past\r\nhim and out of the village.\r\n\r\nHe went athwart one of their meadows, leaving a track of trampled grass\r\nbehind his feet, and presently sat down by the side of one of their\r\nways. He felt something of the buoyancy that comes to all men in the\r\nbeginning of a fight, but more perplexity. He began to realise that you\r\ncannot even fight happily with creatures who stand upon a different\r\nmental basis to yourself. Far away he saw a number of men carrying\r\nspades and sticks come out of the street of houses and advance in a\r\nspreading line along the several paths towards him. They advanced\r\nslowly, speaking frequently to one another, and ever and again the\r\nwhole cordon would halt and sniff the air and listen.\r\n\r\nThe first time they did this Nunez laughed. But afterwards he did not\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\nOne struck his trail in the meadow grass and came stooping and feeling\r\nhis way along it.\r\n\r\nFor five minutes he watched the slow extension of the cordon, and then\r\nhis vague disposition to do something forthwith became frantic. He\r\nstood up, went a pace or so towards the circumferential wall, turned,\r\nand went back a little way. There they all stood in a crescent, still\r\nand listening.\r\n\r\nHe also stood still, gripping his spade very tightly in both hands.\r\nShould he charge them?\r\n\r\nThe pulse in his ears ran into the rhythm of “In the Country of the\r\nBlind the One-Eyed Man is King.”\r\n\r\nShould he charge them?\r\n\r\nHe looked back at the high and unclimbable wall behind—unclimbable\r\nbecause of its smooth plastering, but withal pierced with many little\r\ndoors and at the approaching line of seekers. Behind these others were\r\nnow coming out of the street of houses.\r\n\r\nShould he charge them?\r\n\r\n“Bogota!” called one. “Bogota! where are you?”\r\n\r\nHe gripped his spade still tighter and advanced down the meadows\r\ntowards the place of habitations, and directly he moved they converged\r\nupon him. “I’ll hit them if they touch me,” he swore; “by Heaven, I\r\nwill. I’ll hit.” He called aloud, “Look here, I’m going to do what I\r\nlike in this valley! Do you hear? I’m going to do what I like and go\r\nwhere I like.”\r\n\r\nThey were moving in upon him quickly, groping, yet moving rapidly. It\r\nwas like playing blind man’s buff with everyone blindfolded except one.\r\n“Get hold of him!” cried one. He found himself in the arc of a loose\r\ncurve of pursuers. He felt suddenly he must be active and resolute.\r\n\r\n“You don’t understand,” he cried, in a voice that was meant to be great\r\nand resolute, and which broke. “You are blind and I can see. Leave me\r\nalone!”\r\n\r\n“Bogota! Put down that spade and come off the grass!”\r\n\r\nThe last order, grotesque in its urban familiarity, produced a gust of\r\nanger. “I’ll hurt you,” he said, sobbing with emotion. “By Heaven, I’ll\r\nhurt you! Leave me alone!”\r\n\r\nHe began to run—not knowing clearly where to run. He ran from the\r\nnearest blind man, because it was a horror to hit him. He stopped, and\r\nthen made a dash to escape from their closing ranks. He made for where\r\na gap was wide, and the men on either side, with a quick perception of\r\nthe approach of his paces, rushed in on one another. He sprang forward,\r\nand then saw he must be caught, and _swish!_ the spade had struck. He\r\nfelt the soft thud of hand and arm, and the man was down with a yell of\r\npain, and he was through.\r\n\r\nThrough! And then he was close to the street of houses again, and blind\r\nmen, whirling spades and stakes, were running with a reasoned swiftness\r\nhither and thither.\r\n\r\nHe heard steps behind him just in time, and found a tall man rushing\r\nforward and swiping at the sound of him. He lost his nerve, hurled his\r\nspade a yard wide of this antagonist, and whirled about and fled,\r\nfairly yelling as he dodged another.\r\n\r\nHe was panic-stricken. He ran furiously to and fro, dodging when there\r\nwas no need to dodge, and, in his anxiety to see on every side of him\r\nat once, stumbling. For a moment he was down and they heard his fall.\r\nFar away in the circumferential wall a little doorway looked like\r\nHeaven, and he set off in a wild rush for it. He did not even look\r\nround at his pursuers until it was gained, and he had stumbled across\r\nthe bridge, clambered a little way among the rocks, to the surprise and\r\ndismay of a young llama, who went leaping out of sight, and lay down\r\nsobbing for breath.\r\n\r\nAnd so his _coup d’etat_ came to an end.\r\n\r\nHe stayed outside the wall of the valley of the blind for two nights\r\nand days without food or shelter, and meditated upon the Unexpected.\r\nDuring these meditations he repeated very frequently and always with a\r\nprofounder note of derision the exploded proverb: “In the Country of\r\nthe Blind the One-Eyed Man is King.” He thought chiefly of ways of\r\nfighting and conquering these people, and it grew clear that for him no\r\npracticable way was possible. He had no weapons, and now it would be\r\nhard to get one.\r\n\r\nThe canker of civilisation had got to him even in Bogota, and he could\r\nnot find it in himself to go down and assassinate a blind man. Of\r\ncourse, if he did that, he might then dictate terms on the threat of\r\nassassinating them all. But—Sooner or later he must sleep! . . . .\r\n\r\nHe tried also to find food among the pine trees, to be comfortable\r\nunder pine boughs while the frost fell at night, and—with less\r\nconfidence—to catch a llama by artifice in order to try to kill\r\nit—perhaps by hammering it with a stone—and so finally, perhaps, to eat\r\nsome of it. But the llamas had a doubt of him and regarded him with\r\ndistrustful brown eyes and spat when he drew near. Fear came on him the\r\nsecond day and fits of shivering. Finally he crawled down to the wall\r\nof the Country of the Blind and tried to make his terms. He crawled\r\nalong by the stream, shouting, until two blind men came out to the gate\r\nand talked to him.\r\n\r\n“I was mad,” he said. “But I was only newly made.”\r\n\r\nThey said that was better.\r\n\r\nHe told them he was wiser now, and repented of all he had done.\r\n\r\nThen he wept without intention, for he was very weak and ill now, and\r\nthey took that as a favourable sign.\r\n\r\nThey asked him if he still thought he could “_see_.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he said. “That was folly. The word means nothing. Less than\r\nnothing!”\r\n\r\nThey asked him what was overhead.\r\n\r\n“About ten times ten the height of a man there is a roof above the\r\nworld—of rock—and very, very smooth. So smooth—so beautifully smooth .\r\n.” He burst again into hysterical tears. “Before you ask me any more,\r\ngive me some food or I shall die!”\r\n\r\nHe expected dire punishments, but these blind people were capable of\r\ntoleration. They regarded his rebellion as but one more proof of his\r\ngeneral idiocy and inferiority, and after they had whipped him they\r\nappointed him to do the simplest and heaviest work they had for anyone\r\nto do, and he, seeing no other way of living, did submissively what he\r\nwas told.\r\n\r\nHe was ill for some days and they nursed him kindly. That refined his\r\nsubmission. But they insisted on his lying in the dark, and that was a\r\ngreat misery. And blind philosophers came and talked to him of the\r\nwicked levity of his mind, and reproved him so impressively for his\r\ndoubts about the lid of rock that covered their cosmic _casserole_ that\r\nhe almost doubted whether indeed he was not the victim of hallucination\r\nin not seeing it overhead.\r\n\r\nSo Nunez became a citizen of the Country of the Blind, and these people\r\nceased to be a generalised people and became individualities to him,\r\nand familiar to him, while the world beyond the mountains became more\r\nand more remote and unreal. There was Yacob, his master, a kindly man\r\nwhen not annoyed; there was Pedro, Yacob’s nephew; and there was\r\nMedina-sarote, who was the youngest daughter of Yacob. She was little\r\nesteemed in the world of the blind, because she had a clear-cut face\r\nand lacked that satisfying, glossy smoothness that is the blind man’s\r\nideal of feminine beauty, but Nunez thought her beautiful at first, and\r\npresently the most beautiful thing in the whole creation. Her closed\r\neyelids were not sunken and red after the common way of the valley, but\r\nlay as though they might open again at any moment; and she had long\r\neyelashes, which were considered a grave disfigurement. And her voice\r\nwas weak and did not satisfy the acute hearing of the valley swains. So\r\nthat she had no lover.\r\n\r\nThere came a time when Nunez thought that, could he win her, he would\r\nbe resigned to live in the valley for all the rest of his days.\r\n\r\nHe watched her; he sought opportunities of doing her little services\r\nand presently he found that she observed him. Once at a rest-day\r\ngathering they sat side by side in the dim starlight, and the music was\r\nsweet. His hand came upon hers and he dared to clasp it. Then very\r\ntenderly she returned his pressure. And one day, as they were at their\r\nmeal in the darkness, he felt her hand very softly seeking him, and as\r\nit chanced the fire leapt then, and he saw the tenderness of her face.\r\n\r\nHe sought to speak to her.\r\n\r\nHe went to her one day when she was sitting in the summer moonlight\r\nspinning. The light made her a thing of silver and mystery. He sat down\r\nat her feet and told her he loved her, and told her how beautiful she\r\nseemed to him. He had a lover’s voice, he spoke with a tender reverence\r\nthat came near to awe, and she had never before been touched by\r\nadoration. She made him no definite answer, but it was clear his words\r\npleased her.\r\n\r\nAfter that he talked to her whenever he could take an opportunity. The\r\nvalley became the world for him, and the world beyond the mountains\r\nwhere men lived by day seemed no more than a fairy tale he would some\r\nday pour into her ears. Very tentatively and timidly he spoke to her of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nSight seemed to her the most poetical of fancies, and she listened to\r\nhis description of the stars and the mountains and her own sweet\r\nwhite-lit beauty as though it was a guilty indulgence. She did not\r\nbelieve, she could only half understand, but she was mysteriously\r\ndelighted, and it seemed to him that she completely understood.\r\n\r\nHis love lost its awe and took courage. Presently he was for demanding\r\nher of Yacob and the elders in marriage, but she became fearful and\r\ndelayed. And it was one of her elder sisters who first told Yacob that\r\nMedina-sarote and Nunez were in love.\r\n\r\nThere was from the first very great opposition to the marriage of Nunez\r\nand Medina-sarote; not so much because they valued her as because they\r\nheld him as a being apart, an idiot, incompetent thing below the\r\npermissible level of a man. Her sisters opposed it bitterly as bringing\r\ndiscredit on them all; and old Yacob, though he had formed a sort of\r\nliking for his clumsy, obedient serf, shook his head and said the thing\r\ncould not be. The young men were all angry at the idea of corrupting\r\nthe race, and one went so far as to revile and strike Nunez. He struck\r\nback. Then for the first time he found an advantage in seeing, even by\r\ntwilight, and after that fight was over no one was disposed to raise a\r\nhand against him. But they still found his marriage impossible.\r\n\r\nOld Yacob had a tenderness for his last little daughter, and was\r\ngrieved to have her weep upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“You see, my dear, he’s an idiot. He has delusions; he can’t do\r\nanything right.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” wept Medina-sarote. “But he’s better than he was. He’s\r\ngetting better. And he’s strong, dear father, and kind—stronger and\r\nkinder than any other man in the world. And he loves me—and, father, I\r\nlove him.”\r\n\r\nOld Yacob was greatly distressed to find her inconsolable, and,\r\nbesides—what made it more distressing—he liked Nunez for many things.\r\nSo he went and sat in the windowless council-chamber with the other\r\nelders and watched the trend of the talk, and said, at the proper time,\r\n“He’s better than he was. Very likely, some day, we shall find him as\r\nsane as ourselves.”\r\n\r\nThen afterwards one of the elders, who thought deeply, had an idea. He\r\nwas a great doctor among these people, their medicine-man, and he had a\r\nvery philosophical and inventive mind, and the idea of curing Nunez of\r\nhis peculiarities appealed to him. One day when Yacob was present he\r\nreturned to the topic of Nunez. “I have examined Nunez,” he said, “and\r\nthe case is clearer to me. I think very probably he might be cured.”\r\n\r\n“This is what I have always hoped,” said old Yacob.\r\n\r\n“His brain is affected,” said the blind doctor.\r\n\r\nThe elders murmured assent.\r\n\r\n“Now, _what_ affects it?”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said old Yacob.\r\n\r\n“_This_,” said the doctor, answering his own question. “Those queer\r\nthings that are called the eyes, and which exist to make an agreeable\r\ndepression in the face, are diseased, in the case of Nunez, in such a\r\nway as to affect his brain. They are greatly distended, he has\r\neyelashes, and his eyelids move, and consequently his brain is in a\r\nstate of constant irritation and distraction.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said old Yacob. “Yes?”\r\n\r\n“And I think I may say with reasonable certainty that, in order to cure\r\nhim complete, all that we need to do is a simple and easy surgical\r\noperation—namely, to remove these irritant bodies.”\r\n\r\n“And then he will be sane?”\r\n\r\n“Then he will be perfectly sane, and a quite admirable citizen.”\r\n\r\n“Thank Heaven for science!” said old Yacob, and went forth at once to\r\ntell Nunez of his happy hopes.\r\n\r\nBut Nunez’s manner of receiving the good news struck him as being cold\r\nand disappointing.\r\n\r\n“One might think,” he said, “from the tone you take that you did not\r\ncare for my daughter.”\r\n\r\nIt was Medina-sarote who persuaded Nunez to face the blind surgeons.\r\n\r\n“_You_ do not want me,” he said, “to lose my gift of sight?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n“My world is sight.”\r\n\r\nHer head drooped lower.\r\n\r\n“There are the beautiful things, the beautiful little things—the\r\nflowers, the lichens amidst the rocks, the light and softness on a\r\npiece of fur, the far sky with its drifting dawn of clouds, the sunsets\r\nand the stars. And there is _you_. For you alone it is good to have\r\nsight, to see your sweet, serene face, your kindly lips, your dear,\r\nbeautiful hands folded together. . . . . It is these eyes of mine you\r\nwon, these eyes that hold me to you, that these idiots seek. Instead, I\r\nmust touch you, hear you, and never see you again. I must come under\r\nthat roof of rock and stone and darkness, that horrible roof under\r\nwhich your imaginations stoop . . . _No_; _you_ would not have me do\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\nA disagreeable doubt had arisen in him. He stopped and left the thing a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“I wish,” she said, “sometimes—” She paused.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” he said, a little apprehensively.\r\n\r\n“I wish sometimes—you would not talk like that.”\r\n\r\n“Like what?”\r\n\r\n“I know it’s pretty—it’s your imagination. I love it, but _now_—”\r\n\r\nHe felt cold. “_Now?_” he said, faintly.\r\n\r\nShe sat quite still.\r\n\r\n“You mean—you think—I should be better, better perhaps—”\r\n\r\nHe was realising things very swiftly. He felt anger perhaps, anger at\r\nthe dull course of fate, but also sympathy for her lack of\r\nunderstanding—a sympathy near akin to pity.\r\n\r\n“_Dear_,” he said, and he could see by her whiteness how tensely her\r\nspirit pressed against the things she could not say. He put his arms\r\nabout her, he kissed her ear, and they sat for a time in silence.\r\n\r\n“If I were to consent to this?” he said at last, in a voice that was\r\nvery gentle.\r\n\r\nShe flung her arms about him, weeping wildly. “Oh, if you would,” she\r\nsobbed, “if only you would!”\r\n\r\nFor a week before the operation that was to raise him from his\r\nservitude and inferiority to the level of a blind citizen Nunez knew\r\nnothing of sleep, and all through the warm, sunlit hours, while the\r\nothers slumbered happily, he sat brooding or wandered aimlessly, trying\r\nto bring his mind to bear on his dilemma. He had given his answer, he\r\nhad given his consent, and still he was not sure. And at last work-time\r\nwas over, the sun rose in splendour over the golden crests, and his\r\nlast day of vision began for him. He had a few minutes with\r\nMedina-sarote before she went apart to sleep.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow,” he said, “I shall see no more.”\r\n\r\n“Dear heart!” she answered, and pressed his hands with all her\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n“They will hurt you but little,” she said; “and you are going through\r\nthis pain, you are going through it, dear lover, for _me_ . . . . Dear,\r\nif a woman’s heart and life can do it, I will repay you. My dearest\r\none, my dearest with the tender voice, I will repay.”\r\n\r\nHe was drenched in pity for himself and her.\r\n\r\nHe held her in his arms, and pressed his lips to hers and looked on her\r\nsweet face for the last time. “Good-bye!” he whispered to that dear\r\nsight, “good-bye!”\r\n\r\nAnd then in silence he turned away from her.\r\n\r\nShe could hear his slow retreating footsteps, and something in the\r\nrhythm of them threw her into a passion of weeping.\r\n\r\nHe walked away.\r\n\r\nHe had fully meant to go to a lonely place where the meadows were\r\nbeautiful with white narcissus, and there remain until the hour of his\r\nsacrifice should come, but as he walked he lifted up his eyes and saw\r\nthe morning, the morning like an angel in golden armour, marching down\r\nthe steeps . . . .\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that before this splendour he and this blind world in\r\nthe valley, and his love and all, were no more than a pit of sin.\r\n\r\nHe did not turn aside as he had meant to do, but went on and passed\r\nthrough the wall of the circumference and out upon the rocks, and his\r\neyes were always upon the sunlit ice and snow.\r\n\r\nHe saw their infinite beauty, and his imagination soared over them to\r\nthe things beyond he was now to resign for ever!\r\n\r\nHe thought of that great free world that he was parted from, the world\r\nthat was his own, and he had a vision of those further slopes, distance\r\nbeyond distance, with Bogota, a place of multitudinous stirring beauty,\r\na glory by day, a luminous mystery by night, a place of palaces and\r\nfountains and statues and white houses, lying beautifully in the middle\r\ndistance. He thought how for a day or so one might come down through\r\npasses drawing ever nearer and nearer to its busy streets and ways. He\r\nthought of the river journey, day by day, from great Bogota to the\r\nstill vaster world beyond, through towns and villages, forest and\r\ndesert places, the rushing river day by day, until its banks receded,\r\nand the big steamers came splashing by and one had reached the sea—the\r\nlimitless sea, with its thousand islands, its thousands of islands, and\r\nits ships seen dimly far away in their incessant journeyings round and\r\nabout that greater world. And there, unpent by mountains, one saw the\r\nsky—the sky, not such a disc as one saw it here, but an arch of\r\nimmeasurable blue, a deep of deeps in which the circling stars were\r\nfloating . . . .\r\n\r\nHis eyes began to scrutinise the great curtain of the mountains with a\r\nkeener inquiry.\r\n\r\nFor example; if one went so, up that gully and to that chimney there,\r\nthen one might come out high among those stunted pines that ran round\r\nin a sort of shelf and rose still higher and higher as it passed above\r\nthe gorge. And then? That talus might be managed. Thence perhaps a\r\nclimb might be found to take him up to the precipice that came below\r\nthe snow; and if that chimney failed, then another farther to the east\r\nmight serve his purpose better. And then? Then one would be out upon\r\nthe amber-lit snow there, and half-way up to the crest of those\r\nbeautiful desolations. And suppose one had good fortune!\r\n\r\nHe glanced back at the village, then turned right round and regarded it\r\nwith folded arms.\r\n\r\nHe thought of Medina-sarote, and she had become small and remote.\r\n\r\nHe turned again towards the mountain wall down which the day had come\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nThen very circumspectly he began his climb.\r\n\r\nWhen sunset came he was not longer climbing, but he was far and high.\r\nHis clothes were torn, his limbs were bloodstained, he was bruised in\r\nmany places, but he lay as if he were at his ease, and there was a\r\nsmile on his face.\r\n\r\nFrom where he rested the valley seemed as if it were in a pit and\r\nnearly a mile below. Already it was dim with haze and shadow, though\r\nthe mountain summits around him were things of light and fire. The\r\nmountain summits around him were things of light and fire, and the\r\nlittle things in the rocks near at hand were drenched with light and\r\nbeauty, a vein of green mineral piercing the grey, a flash of small\r\ncrystal here and there, a minute, minutely-beautiful orange lichen\r\nclose beside his face. There were deep, mysterious shadows in the\r\ngorge, blue deepening into purple, and purple into a luminous darkness,\r\nand overhead was the illimitable vastness of the sky. But he heeded\r\nthese things no longer, but lay quite still there, smiling as if he\r\nwere content now merely to have escaped from the valley of the Blind,\r\nin which he had thought to be King. And the glow of the sunset passed,\r\nand the night came, and still he lay there, under the cold, clear\r\nstars.",
