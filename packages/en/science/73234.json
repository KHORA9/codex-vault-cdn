Not needlessly to confound the herald with the historian,\r\n    and begin a relation with a pedigree....”—ROBERT BOYLE’S\r\n    _Philaretus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n“My wife, God ever be praised, was about 3 of the clock in thafternoon of\r\nthis day, the sign in gemini, libra, Safely delivered of her seaventh son\r\nat Lismoor: God bless him, for his name is Robert Boyle.”[1]\r\n\r\nSo runs the entry, under the date January 25, 1626 (7), in the private\r\ndiary of the great Earl of Cork, a manuscript preserved at Lismore to\r\nthis day. When he wrote those words, the Earl was already a man of\r\nsixty, who, after forty strenuous years, was nearing the zenith of his\r\ngreat fortunes. The Countess—his second wife—was twenty years younger:\r\nshe had been just seventeen when he married her, and he a widower of\r\nthirty-seven. They had been married three-and-twenty years, and in those\r\nthree-and-twenty years, at one or other of their roughly splendid Irish\r\nhomes, seven daughters and seven sons had been born to them.\r\n\r\nTheir earliest home had been the College house of Youghal, “re-edified”\r\nto suit the Earl’s requirements; but in these later years they were\r\nused to divide their time travelling in state, with coaches and horses\r\nand a mounted retinue, between Youghal and the town house in Dublin\r\nand this other house of Lismore, already “one of the noblest seats in\r\nthe province of Munster.”[2] And the Earl was still busy “re-edifying”\r\nthis also,—building stables and coach-houses, pigeon-houses and\r\nslaughter-houses, storing the fishponds in his park with young carp and\r\ntench from Amsterdam, and “compassing” his orchards and terraced gardens\r\nwith a huge turreted wall,—when this fourteenth child, the “Robyn” that\r\nwas to prove the greatest of all his children, was born at Lismore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe story of how Mr. Richard Boyle became the great Earl of Cork is one\r\nof the most brilliant romances of the British Peerage. It has been often\r\ntold, nowhere more graphically than by the Earl himself, in his brief\r\n_True Remembrances_.[3] So triumphant and so circumstantial, indeed,\r\nare the Earl’s “Remembrances,” that many generations of ordinary-minded\r\npeople have made the mistake of thinking they cannot possibly be true.\r\nOnly of recent years, since, in fact, the Earl’s own letters and the\r\nEarl’s own private diary, kept to within a few days of his death, have\r\nbeen given to the world under the title of the Lismore Papers, has the\r\ncloud of incredulity rolled aside; and the character of this man stands\r\nout to-day in its integrity, to use his own words, “as cleer as the son\r\nat high noon.”[4]\r\n\r\nIt is the character of a great Englishman, one of Elizabeth’s\r\nsoldier-statesmen and merchant-adventurers: a man typically Elizabethan\r\nin his virtues and his faults, though he was to live far into the\r\nunhappy reign of Charles I. Passionately Protestant, passionately\r\nRoyalist, a fine blend of the astute and the ingenuous, with strong\r\nfamily affections, splendid ambitions and schemes of statecraft, he was\r\nrelentless in his prejudices and enmities, indomitably self-sufficient,\r\nand with as much vitality in his little finger as may be found in a whole\r\nparliamentary Bench to-day. He raised himself from “very inconsiderable\r\nbeginnings” to be one of the greatest subjects of the realm, one of the\r\ngreatest Englishmen of his day.\r\n\r\nHe had been born at Canterbury, the second son of the second son of\r\na country squire—one of the Boyles of Herefordshire. His father had\r\nmigrated into Kent, married a daughter of Robert Naylor of Canterbury,\r\nand settled at Preston, near Faversham. Here, when Richard was ten\r\nyears old, his father died, leaving his widow to bring up her family\r\nof two daughters and three sons on a modest income as best she could.\r\nMrs. Boyle had managed very well. The eldest son, John, and Richard,\r\nthe second, were sent to the King’s School, Canterbury, and from there\r\n(Richard with a scholarship) to Bennet College, Cambridge.[5] John Boyle\r\nduly took Orders, while Richard, the cleverer younger brother, went up\r\nto London to study law. At one-and-twenty he seems to have been settled\r\nin chambers in the Middle Temple, clerk to Sir Richard Manwood, Chief\r\nBaron of the Exchequer. At his mother’s death (Roger Boyle and Joan\r\nNaylor his wife were buried in Preston Parish Church), Richard Boyle\r\ndecided that he would never “raise a fortune” in the Middle Temple, and\r\nmust “travel into foreign kingdoms,” and “gain learning, knowledge, and\r\nexperience abroad in the world.” And the foreign kingdom toward which\r\nhe turned his strenuous young face was Ireland: Ireland in the reign of\r\nElizabeth, in the year of the Armada. It was five-and-twenty years since\r\nthe Irish chieftain Shan O’Neil had presented himself at Elizabeth’s\r\nCourt, to be gazed at by peers and ambassadors and bishops as if he\r\nwere “some wild animal of the desert.”[6] Shan O’Neil had stalked into\r\nthe Queen’s presence, “his saffron mantle sweeping round and round him,\r\nhis hair curling on his back and clipped short below the eyes, which\r\ngleamed under it with a grey lustre, burning fierce and cruel.”[7] And\r\nbehind him were his bare-headed, fair-haired Galloglasse, clad in their\r\nshirts of mail and wolfskins, with their short, broad battle-axes in\r\ntheir hands. The chieftain had flung himself upon his face before the\r\nQueen with protestations of loyalty and fair intention; and all those\r\nfive-and-twenty years the attitude of Ireland had been one of submission\r\nand protestation, flanked and backed by wolfskins, shirts of mail and\r\nbattle-axes. The Desmond Rebellion had been quelled amid horrors. It\r\nwas still a “savadge nation”[8] this, to which Mr. Richard Boyle was\r\nsetting forth: an Ireland of primeval forests and papal churchlands, of\r\nvivid pastures and peel towers and untamed Erse-speaking tribes. With\r\nits ores and timber, its grasslands and salmon-fishing, its fine ports,\r\nand, above all, its proximity to Elizabethan England, it was a land\r\nteeming with industrial possibilities; but it bristled and whispered with\r\nrace-hatred and creed-hatred, with persecution and conspiracy. This was\r\nthe Ireland that was being eagerly peopled and exploited and parcelled\r\nout by Elizabethan Englishmen.\r\n\r\nAnd so, on Midsummer Eve 1588, another clever young man arrived in\r\nDublin. He had twenty-seven pounds and three shillings[9] in his\r\npossession, and on his wrist and finger he wore the two “tokens” left him\r\nby his dead Kentish mother—the gold bracelet on his wrist, worth about\r\n£10, and the diamond ring on his finger, the “happy, lucky and fortunate\r\nstone” that was to stay there till his death, and be left an heirloom to\r\nhis son’s son and successive generations of the great Boyle family.\r\n\r\nThe Earl never forgot the accoutrements and the various suits of clothes\r\nwith which he started in life when, at two-and-twenty, he shut the door\r\nof his chambers in the Middle Temple behind him: “A taffety doublet cut\r\nwith and upon taffety; a pair of black velvet breeches laced, a new Milan\r\nfustian suit, laced and cut upon taffety, two cloaks, competent linen\r\nand necessaries, with my rapier and dagger.” And he must have carried\r\nletters of introduction also, which procured the young lawyer employment\r\nand influential friends; for Mr. Richard Boyle was very soon launched\r\non Dublin society, and was on friendly terms with at least two men who\r\nhailed from his own county of Kent, Sir Edward Moore, of Mellifont,\r\nin Meath, and Sir Anthony St. Leger, who was living in Dublin. It is\r\nmore than possible that he met also at this time the poet Spenser;\r\nfor Dublin must have been Spenser’s headquarters since 1580, when he\r\ncame over to Ireland as Secretary to the Lord Deputy. Spenser, who it\r\nis believed had been through all the horrors of the Desmond Rebellion,\r\nwas, in 1588, after having held various appointments, leaving Dublin to\r\ntake up his bachelor abode at Kilcolman, a peel tower abandoned by the\r\nDesmonds and assigned, with some thousands of acres around it, to this\r\nEnglish poet-politician, already known as the author of the _Shepheard’s\r\nCalendar_. At Kilcolman, in this peel tower in a wild wooded glen among\r\nthe Galtee Hills, about thirty miles south of Limerick, Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh came to stay with Spenser when he too was in Ireland, inspecting\r\nthe vast Irish estates that had been assigned to him. It was there they\r\nread their poems aloud to each other, and that Raleigh persuaded Spenser\r\nto go back with him to London, together to offer their poems to the\r\nQueen. During the first year or two, therefore, of Boyle’s sojourn in\r\nIreland, while he was working his way into the notice of Englishmen of\r\ninfluence there, Spenser was in London, being lionised as the Poet of\r\nPoets, the author of the first three books of the _Faerie Queene_.\r\n\r\nWhen Spenser returned to Ireland with a royal pension as Clerk to the\r\nCouncil of the Province of Munster, Richard Boyle was already clerk, or\r\ndeputy, to the “Escheator General,” busy adjusting the claims of the\r\nCrown to “escheated” Irish lands and titles—travelling about, and making\r\nenemies of all people who did not get exactly what they wanted out of the\r\nEscheator or the Escheator’s clerk. Both Boyle’s sisters had joined him\r\nin Ireland, and both were soon to marry husbands there; and somewhere\r\nabout this time his cousin, Elizabeth Boyle, daughter of James Boyle, of\r\nthe Greyfriars in Hereford, was in Ireland, and the poet Spenser, back\r\nfrom his London visit, the literary hero of the hour, met and fell in\r\nlove with Boyle’s cousin Elizabeth. She is the lady of the _Amoretti_\r\nand _Epithalamium_; “my beautifullest bride,” with the “sunshyny face,”\r\nand the “long, loose, yellow locks lyke golden wyre,” whose name the\r\npoet-lover was to trace in the yellow Irish sands, and of whom he sang so\r\nproudly—\r\n\r\n    “Tell me, ye merchants’ daughters, did you see\r\n    So fayre a creature in your town before, ...?”\r\n\r\nThey were married in the Cathedral of Cork in the summer of 1594. A few\r\nmonths later, Spenser turned his face Londonwards again, taking with him\r\npresumably his English wife, and certainly the other three books of his\r\n_Faerie Queene_. He was to return to Ireland once again.\r\n\r\nIn 1595, a year after Spenser’s marriage to Elizabeth Boyle, Mr. Richard\r\nBoyle married a young Limerick lady, Joan Apsley, one of the two\r\ndaughters and co-heirs of Mr. William Apsley, a member of the Council of\r\nMunster. Joan Apsley’s five hundred a year in Irish lands, “so goodly\r\nand commodious a soyle,”[10] was to be the foundation of Mr. Boyle’s\r\nfortunes. She left it all to him when she died, at Mallow, “in travail\r\nwith her first child,” and was buried in Buttevant Church with her little\r\nstillborn son in her arms.\r\n\r\nAfter his wife’s death, Richard Boyle, now a landowner and a man of\r\nsome importance in Munster, had his time full fighting his personal\r\nenemies. There were powerful men among them, and by his own account they\r\n“all joined together, by their lies, complaining against me to Queen\r\nElizabeth.” It was impossible, they said, he could have advanced so\r\nrapidly by honest means. They accordingly accused him of embezzlement\r\nand forgery, and, because some of his wife’s relations were well-known\r\nCatholics, they accused him—staunch Protestant as he was—of acquiring\r\nlands with Spanish gold, of harbouring priests, and being himself a\r\npapist in disguise. They even accused him of stealing a horse. For a\r\ntime he was actually kept in a Dublin prison, and when by a kind of\r\nfluke he found the prison doors opened to him, and was intending to\r\n“take shipping,” and to “justify” himself before the Queen in London,\r\nthe General Rebellion of Munster broke out. In the debacle, Mr. Richard\r\nBoyle—his wife’s lands wasted and his moneys gone—did manage to escape to\r\nEngland. And so did the poet Spenser—Spenser, marked of the rebels, the\r\nauthor not only of the _Faerie Queene_, but of the _View of the Present\r\nState of Ireland_. Why did Spenser ever return to Ireland to undertake\r\nthe duties of Sheriff of Cork? Spenser and his wife and children were at\r\nKilcolman when the Rebellion broke out. They fled for their lives; and\r\nthe old peel tower of the Desmonds was burnt to the ground. One of their\r\nbabies, Ben Jonson told Drummond of Hawthornden, was left behind, and\r\nperished in the flames.\r\n\r\nSpenser was to die in poverty in London, to be buried near to Chaucer in\r\nWestminster Abbey, the poet-mourners flinging their pens into his grave.\r\nSpenser’s wife—Mr. Richard Boyle’s cousin—was to live on in Ireland, to\r\nbring up her children (her son Peregrine was the “Joy of her Life”) and\r\nto marry yet twice again. Twice her great kinsman saw his cousin’s hand\r\n“given in marriage.” She had her compensations in life—but there never\r\nwas another _Epithalamium_.\r\n\r\nArrived in London, Mr. Richard Boyle, through the friendly offices of\r\nAnthony Bacon, whom he had known at Cambridge, was presented to the\r\nnew Lord Deputy, the Earl of Essex, then just starting for Ireland.\r\nQueen Elizabeth may have had her reasons for clapping Mr. Boyle so\r\nunceremoniously into the gate-house of the Tower just as he was thinking\r\nof going back to his old Chambers in the Middle Temple. It is possible\r\nshe was waiting for her new Deputy’s reports from Ireland. In due time\r\nRichard Boyle was fetched before her, and he did “justify” himself to his\r\nSovereign. Her splendid royal words were burnt in upon his memory to the\r\nlast day of his life:[11]—\r\n\r\n“By God’s death, these are but inventions against this young man.” And\r\nagain: “We find him to be a man fit to be employed by ourselves.”\r\n\r\nBoyle was received at Court, and when he was sent back to Ireland it was\r\nas Clerk to the Council of Munster, the very post that Spenser had held.\r\nHe bought Sir Walter Raleigh’s ship, the _Pilgrim_, freighted her with\r\nvictuals and ammunition, sailed in her, “by long seas” to Carrickfoyle,\r\nand took up his new work under the splendid Presidentship of Sir George\r\nCarew. His wife’s lands were recovered: “Richard Boyle of Galbaly in\r\nthe County of Limerick, Gent.,” waited on Carew through all the siege\r\nof Kinsale, and was employed by him to carry the news of victory to\r\nthe Queen in London. There he was the guest of Sir Robert Cecil, “then\r\nprincipal secretary,” in his house in the Strand, and was taken by Cecil\r\nnext morning to Court, and into the bedchamber of her Majesty, “who\r\nremembered me, calling me by name, and giving me her hand to kiss.”[12]\r\n\r\nQuickly back in Ireland, Richard Boyle became the Lord President’s\r\nright hand in all his strenuous services to the Crown: in later years\r\none of the few literary treasures in the great Earl’s “studdie” was the\r\ncopy of Carew’s _Hibernia Pacata_ given him by his Chief. It was Carew\r\nwho sent him in 1602 to London, furnished with letters to Cecil and to\r\nSir Walter Raleigh, recommending him as a fit purchaser of the Raleigh\r\nEstates in Ireland. The thousands of acres in the counties of Cork and\r\nWaterford known as the “Raleigh-Desmond Estates” were then and there,\r\nin London, bought from Sir Walter Raleigh “at a very low rate.” In\r\nRichard Boyle’s hands, the waste lands that to Raleigh had been a source\r\nof anxiety and money loss were to become the best “settled” and most\r\nprosperous territory in Ireland, and a source of wealth and power to\r\nhim who made them so. For Richard Boyle was not only a great landowner,\r\nhe was a shrewd man of business, a capitalist and a large employer of\r\nlabour. It was, says Grosart, “his perseverance and governing faculty\r\nand concentrated energy that transformed bleak mountain and creation-old\r\nfallow moor and quaking bog into hives of population and industry.”[13]\r\n\r\nSir George Carew went a step further. He “dealt very nobly and\r\nfatherlike” with Mr. Boyle in recommending him to marry again. And the\r\nlady whom Carew had in view for his _protégé_ was Katharine Fenton,\r\nthe seventeen-year-old daughter of Sir Geoffrey Fenton, the wise and\r\nenlightened Secretary of State. There is a pretty tradition handed\r\ndown in the Boyle family—the Earl’s own daughter used to tell it—that\r\nMr. Boyle first met his second wife when he was a very young man\r\nnewly arrived in Dublin. Calling one day on business at Sir Geoffrey\r\nFenton’s house, and waiting in an ante-room till the great man should be\r\ndisengaged, Mr. Boyle had “entertained himself” with a pretty child in\r\nher nurse’s arms; and when Sir Geoffrey at last appeared and apologised\r\nfor having kept his visitor waiting, the young man “pleasantly told\r\nhim he had been courting a young lady for his wife.” This must have\r\nbeen in 1588. The marriage took place fifteen years later, and a great\r\ndeal had happened in the interval. Joan Apsley and her baby were buried\r\nin Buttevant Church, and “Richard Boyle of Galbaly in the County of\r\nLimerick, Gent.” had purchased the vast Raleigh Estates. In July 1603 he\r\nwas a wealthy widower of thirty-seven, and Katharine Fenton was seventeen.\r\n\r\n“I never demanded any marriage portion with her, neither promise of any,\r\nit not being in my consideration; yet her father, after my marriage,\r\ngave me one thousand pounds[14] in gold with her. But this gift of his\r\ndaughter to me I must ever thankfully acknowledge as the crown of all my\r\nblessings; for she was a most religious, virtuous, loving, and obedient\r\nwife to me all the days of her life, and the mother of all my hopeful\r\nchildren.”[15]\r\n\r\nElizabeth was dead, and James I reigned in her stead. Sir George\r\nCarew—the new Lord Deputy—had conferred a knighthood on Mr. Boyle on\r\nhis wedding day. Two years later he was made Privy Councillor for the\r\nProvince of Munster, and thenceforward there was to be no stop nor hitch\r\nin the upbuilding of his great fortunes. In 1612, after another visit to\r\nLondon and an audience of King James, he found himself Privy Councillor\r\nof State for the Kingdom of Ireland. He was created Lord Boyle, Baron of\r\nYoughal, in 1616, and Viscount of Dungarvan and Earl of Cork in 1620.\r\nHis home life had run parallel with his public services. “My Howses,”\r\n“My deare Wife,” “the Children,” “my Famullye,” fill an important place\r\nin the Earl’s life and diary and letters; while the wife’s few little\r\nepistolary efforts to her husband have only one beginning: he was to her\r\nalways “My owne goode Selfe.”\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle speaks of his mother’s “free and noble spirit”—which, he\r\nadds, “had a handsome mansion to reside in”—and of her “kindness and\r\nsweet carriage to her own.”[16] The hopeful children came quickly. Roger,\r\nthe first, born at Youghal in 1606, was sent at seven years old to\r\nEngland, at first to his uncle John, then Dr. John Boyle, a prebendary\r\nof Lichfield, and a year later to his mother’s relatives, the Brownes,\r\nof Sayes Court, Deptford. There was an excellent day-school at Deptford,\r\nto which Roger Boyle was sent; and a rather pathetic little figure he\r\nmust have cut, going to and from school, with “shining morning face”\r\nin his baize gown trimmed with fur.[17] On high days and holidays he\r\nwore an ash-coloured satin doublet and cloak, trimmed with squirrel\r\nfur, and a ruff round his little neck; and his baby sword was scarfed\r\nin green. Mrs. Townshend, in her _Life of the Great Earl_, points out\r\nthat the child wore out five pairs of shoes in a year, and that his book\r\nof French verbs cost sixpence. He was to die at Deptford, after a very\r\nshort illness, when he was only nine years old. The Brownes were terribly\r\ndistressed, and did everything they could. Mrs. Browne moved him into her\r\nown chamber, and nursed him in motherly fashion. His Uncle John was sent\r\nfor, and sat by the little fellow’s bed till he died. The physician and\r\napothecary came from London by boat and administered a “cordial powder of\r\nunicornes’ horns,” and other weird “phisicks.” “Little Hodge” was very\r\npatient, and said his prayers of his own accord; and after he was dead\r\nMrs. Browne found that in his little purse, which he called his “stock”\r\n(he must have been very like his father in some ways), there was still\r\nmore than forty shillings unspent. All these details, and many more,\r\nwere sent in letters to the parents at Youghal, and to the grandparents,\r\nSir Geoffrey and Lady Fenton, in Dublin, after “my jewel Hodge,” as the\r\ngrandfather used to call him, was buried in Deptford Parish Church.\r\n\r\nThere were by this time four daughters, born in succession: Alice, Sarah,\r\nLettice, and Joan; a second son, Richard, born at Youghal in 1612; and\r\na fifth daughter, Katharine, who was a baby in arms when “little Hodge”\r\ndied. A few months after his death came Geoffrey; and then Dorothy\r\nin 1617, and Lewis two years later. Another boy was born in 1621 and\r\nchristened Roger; Francis and Mary followed in 1623 and 1624; and then\r\ncame the fourteenth child, “my seaventh son”, and the Earl made that\r\nmemorable entry in his diary at Lismore: “God bless him, for his name is\r\nRobert Boyle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAN IRISH CHILDHOOD\r\n\r\n    “He would ever reckon it amongst the chief misfortunes of his\r\n    life that he did never know her that gave it him.”—ROBERT\r\n    BOYLE’S _Philaretus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, there was a christening in the private chapel at\r\nLismore. The Earl’s chaplain and cousin, Mr. Robert Naylor, officiated,\r\nand a large house-party gathered for the event. Lady Castlehaven, who was\r\nto be the child’s godmother, arrived with her family and retinue just in\r\ntime, and the godfathers were Lord Digby and Sir Francis Slingsby. Lord\r\nDigby was living in the house as a newly made son-in-law, and the boy was\r\nto be named Robert after him.\r\n\r\nThe Earl’s large family of “hopeful children” were already growing up\r\nand scattering when this fourteenth baby made its appearance among them.\r\nAlice, the eldest daughter, at nineteen, had been for some years the\r\nwife of young David Barry, the “Barrymore” who had been brought up in\r\nthe family almost like one of the Earl’s sons. Sarah, the second, at a\r\ntender age, had been transferred to the care of the Earl’s old friend,\r\nLady Moore, at Mellifont, and was married, on the same day as her sister\r\nAlice, to Lady Moore’s son. He died very soon afterwards; and Sarah, at\r\nseventeen, had been a little widow for three years, living again under\r\nher father’s roof; and on the Christmas Day before Robert Boyle’s birth,\r\nSarah had been married a second time—to Robert, Lord Digby, in her\r\nfather’s chapel at Lismore.\r\n\r\nLettice, the third daughter, had been intended for Lady Castlehaven’s\r\nson, but the young man’s religious views were “not conformable”; and\r\nshe and her sister Joan were accordingly kept at home, with a London\r\nseason in view. “Dick,” the now eldest son and heir, already “my Lord\r\nDungarvan,” was at home, being mildly tutored by the Earl’s chaplain,\r\nand living in a boy’s paradise of saddle-horses and “faier goshawks,”\r\nwith an “eyrie of falcons” and occasional “fatt bucks” and “junkettings”;\r\nbut little Katharine, who came next, had been sent away into England to\r\nLady Beaumont—at Coleorton in Leicestershire—mother of Sapcott Beaumont,\r\nthe little girl’s prospective husband. Geoffrey, who would have been ten\r\nyears old when Robert was born, had died as a baby. Tradition says he\r\ntumbled into a well in the Earl’s Walk in Youghal; but the Earl’s diary,\r\nin mentioning the death, makes no reference to the well. Dorothy, now\r\nnine years old, was already destined for Arthur Loftus, Sir Adam Loftus’s\r\nson; and in the autumn before Robert’s birth she had been fetched away\r\nto be brought up in the Loftus family at Rathfarnham. Francis and Mary\r\nwere quite young children in the nursery; and now Robert, the fourteenth\r\nbaby, as soon as he “was able without danger to support the incommodities\r\nof a remove,” was to be carried away from Lismore in the arms of his\r\n“Country Nurse.”[18] The Earl, so Robert Boyle says, had a “perfect\r\naversion to the habit of bringing up children so nice and tenderly that\r\na hot sun or a good shower of rain as much endangers them as if they\r\nwere made of butter or of sugar.” Lady Cork’s opinions do not seem to\r\nhave been asked; perhaps, in those three-and-twenty years, she had taught\r\nherself to think, if not to feel, in unison with her “owne goode selfe.”\r\nAnd so Robert Boyle, like his brothers and sisters, was to be reared\r\nduring those first months of his life by a foster-mother, and owing to\r\nthe movements of his family at this time was to be left with her longer\r\nthan he would perhaps otherwise have been. He was to be rocked in an\r\nIrish cradle, or rather nursed, Irish fashion, in a “pendulous satchell”\r\ninstead of a cradle, with a slit for the baby’s head to look out of.[19]\r\nBy slow degrees, this boy, born amid all the pomp and seventeenth-century\r\nsplendour of his father’s mansions, was to be inured to “a coarse but\r\ncleanly diet,” and to what he afterwards so characteristically described\r\nas “the passions of the air.” They gave him, he says, “so vigorous a\r\ncomplexion” that ‘hardships’ were made easy to him by ‘custom,’ while the\r\ndelights and conveniences of ease were endeared to him by their ‘rarity.’\r\n\r\nHappy months of babyhood, lulled in a cottage mother’s arms, or\r\nsuspended, between sleeping and waking, in that fascinating medium\r\nthat was to become afterwards his life-study! Wise little head of\r\nRobert Boyle, looking out of that slit in the “pendulous satchell,”\r\nbaby-observer of the firelight, and the sunlight and the shadows,\r\nenjoying, without theory, as he swung in it, the “spring of the air”! And\r\nmeantime the baby’s family was preparing for a season in London.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lismore was still being “re-edified” during the months\r\nthat followed the birth of “Robyn.” The gardens and terraces were being\r\nlaid out; the orchard wall was still building. Dick, the eldest son, and\r\nArthur Loftus, the destined son-in-law, had been allowed to go to Dublin\r\nfor the horse-races, with allowance for “wyne and extraordinaryes,”\r\n“horse-meat,” “small sums,” and “idle expenses.” The Earl liked to give\r\npresents: each New Year in his diary is a record of presents given and\r\nreceived; and while he seems to have kept the laced shirts and nightcaps\r\nmade for him by his daughters, he had a habit of handing on the more\r\ncostly gifts to other people. He was at this time tipping his musicians\r\nat Lismore, and commissioning his trusty emissary, Sir John Leeke, to buy\r\nsmock-petticoats for Lady Cork and her mother Lady Fenton, who, since Sir\r\nGeoffrey’s death, had made her home for the most part with her daughter\r\nand her great son-in-law. And the Earl had given his married daughters a\r\nbreeding mare apiece—each mare “with a colt at her feet,” while braces\r\nof bucks and saddle-hackneys had been dispersed among various friends.\r\nHis daughter Sarah’s (Lady Digby’s) first child—a great event in the\r\nfamily—was born at Lismore in October; and towards the end of 1627, with\r\nthe London visit in view, the Earl dispatched a footman with letters into\r\nEngland. Early in the spring of 1628, Sarah, with her lord and baby,\r\nleft Lismore; in April, Mary Boyle was fetched away to be brought up\r\nunder Lady Clayton’s charge at Cork; Lady Fenton also left Lismore; and\r\nlittle Francis was carried off to Youghal by Sir Lawrence Parson’s lady.\r\nAs the visit to England drew nearer, the Earl made his last will and\r\ntestament—in duplicate. “Thone” copy was to be locked up in his great\r\niron chest at Lismore, which was fitted with three keys, to be left with\r\nthree trusted kinsmen, who were to add to the chest the Earl’s moneys\r\nas they accumulated; and “thother” copy was to be carried by the Earl\r\nhimself into England.\r\n\r\nOn April 21st a great cavalcade—the Earl and his wife, with their two\r\ndaughters, Lettice and Joan, and the rest of their party and retinue—set\r\nout for Youghal, where on May 7th they took shipping (a captain had been\r\nhired to “wafte them over”) and reached London on May 16th;—not without\r\nadventures, for they were chased by a Dunkirker of 300 tons, and though\r\nthe family escaped, the footmen and horses following in another barque\r\nwere taken and carried off to sea.\r\n\r\nThat London season of 1628, when Charles I was the young King of England!\r\nWhat a busy, self-important, gratifying time it was, and what an amount\r\nof feeing and tipping and social engineering was requisite to carry it\r\nthrough! The Earl was received by the Duke of Buckingham and presented\r\nto the King. He engaged a steward for his household, and rented my Lord\r\nGrandison’s house in Channell Row, Westminster.[20] In June Lady Cork\r\nand her daughters were presented to the Queen, who kissed them all most\r\ngraciously. Mr. Perkins, the London tailor, a very well-known man among\r\nthe aristocracy as “the jerkin-maker of St. Martin’s”, was sent for to\r\nreceive his orders. The Earl must have had his mind fully occupied and\r\nhis purse-strings loose; for there were at least two troublesome lawsuits\r\ngoing on at this time about his Irish estates and industries, and he was\r\nemploying the great Glanville as his legal adviser. But nothing seems\r\nto have interfered with the somewhat stodgy gaieties of that London\r\nseason of 1628. And in preparation there were purchases of upholstery\r\nand table-linen in Cheapside; of “wares” for the ladies of the family,\r\nin Lombard Street; velvet, cloth of gold, and what-not. How different\r\nall this from the old-young life in the shabby chambers in the Middle\r\nTemple, or the weeks spent in the Gate-house, waiting to be called before\r\nQueen Elizabeth! But the great self-made man had not forgotten the old\r\ndays. He had always given a helping hand to his own kith and kin: Ireland\r\nwas sprinkled with his “cozens.” His brother John, the poor parson of\r\nLichfield, had the good fortune to at least die Bishop of Cork. And now,\r\non this visit to London, the Earl had no intention of neglecting his\r\n“cozen,” the lawyer Naylor of Gray’s Inn, or his “cozen” the vintner\r\nCroone of the King’s Head Tavern in Fleet Street.[21]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Bedford had offered his house of Northall for the autumn;\r\nand visits were paid in state, with coaches and horses, to the Bedford\r\nfamily and to the Earl’s old Chief, Carew. Carew, now Earl of Totness,\r\nlived at Nonsuch, near Epsom, the wonderful house of Henry VIII’s reign,\r\nset in its park of elms and walnuts, with its gilded and timbered\r\noutside, ornamented with figures of stucco, and paintings by Rubens and\r\nHolbein.[22] Little wonder, in the circumstances, that the Earl of\r\nCork’s coachmen and footmen all demanded new liveries.\r\n\r\nIn August the whole family removed to Northall, and later in the year\r\nthey visited Lord and Lady Digby at Coleshill in Warwickshire, and\r\nLady Beaumont at Coleorton in Leicestershire. Here the match between\r\n“Katy” and Sapcott Beaumont was broken off, the money arrangements not\r\nsatisfying the Earl, and Katy was handed over to Lady Digby’s charge.\r\nWhile the Cork cavalcade were moving about from one great house to\r\nanother, there came the news of the murder of Buckingham at Portsmouth;\r\nbut this tragic event did not interfere with a visit to Oxford in\r\nSeptember. The party that set out from Coleshill, on September 1st,\r\nincluded Lady Digby, whose second baby was born inconveniently the day\r\nafter their arrival in Oxford, in the house of Dr. Weston, Lady Cork’s\r\nuncle, in Christchurch. “Dick” was now at Christchurch, with Arthur\r\nLoftus and the young Earl of Kildare; and Lettice and Joan both met\r\ntheir fates during this visit, Lettice marrying, very soon after, George\r\nGoring, handsome, plausible, dissolute and cold; while Joan was promised\r\nto the wild young “Faerie Earle” of Kildare.\r\n\r\nBack in London, after taking Eton on the way, the Earl of Cork and his\r\nwife and daughters made a little pilgrimage. They all rode to “my Uncle\r\nBrowne’s to Deptford,” and visited little Roger’s grave in Deptford\r\nparish church. They “viewed” the monument that the Earl had set up there,\r\nand for which the “Tombe-maker” had sent in his bill. And the Earl was so\r\npleased with it that he employed the same man to make “a faier alabaster\r\ntombe” over the grave of his parents, in the parish church of Preston in\r\nKent.\r\n\r\nAs the year drew to a close, the Earl’s moneys from his furnaces, forges,\r\nironworks, “tobackoe farms” and what-not, were added to the great iron\r\nchest at Lismore; and Christmas and New Year gifts were showered among\r\nhis English friends. A manuscript Bible was sent to Dr. Weston for\r\nChristchurch Library; “cane-apples” (variously described as the Arbutus\r\nand the Espalier apples) and pickled scallops from Ireland, to other\r\nfriends; “a rare lyttle book” to the Earl of Arundel, and usquebaugh to\r\nthe Earl of Suffolk. Sir Edmund Verney’s new butler from Ireland came\r\nin for the Earl’s own scarlet doublet with hose and cloak, while the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury[23] accepted a “ronlett of usquebaugh” and a\r\npiece of black frieze for a cassock.\r\n\r\nAnd then the Earl made an ominous entry in his diary: “I gave Dr. Moor\r\n£5 and Dr. Gifford 20_s._ for visiting my wife in her sickness”; and “my\r\nwife’s phisick” is an item in the Earl’s accounts. But they spent the\r\nearly spring at Langley Park near Windsor, and in April were back again\r\nin Channell Row, where on April 15th Lady Cork’s fifteenth child—a little\r\ngirl—was born. In June they removed to Lord Warwick’s house in Lincoln’s\r\nInn; and in October 1629—the baby Margaret being left behind them with\r\nher nurse and maid—they were back in Ireland again.\r\n\r\nThe return journey had been made with even more pomp and ceremony\r\nthan the setting forth eighteen months before. For one of the King’s\r\nships, the _Ninth Whelp_—one of the fleet of “Lion Whelps,” built at\r\nDeptford—was at the last moment put at their disposal to “wafte them\r\nover.” Lord Cork distributed presents among the ship’s company, and gave\r\nthe captain at parting a magnificent pair of fringed and embroidered\r\ngloves, to which Lady Cork added a black silk night-cap, wrought with\r\ngold. The men, horses and luggage, followed safely in two barques—no\r\nDunkirker being sighted on the way.\r\n\r\nBefore the Earl left Ireland, he and the Lord Chancellor[24] had not\r\nbeen on the best of terms. But now, fresh from the civilisation of the\r\nMetropolis, and with all the reflected glory of a crossing in the _Ninth\r\nWhelp_, the Earl, by the King’s desire, made up his quarrel with the\r\nChancellor. Both were sworn Lords Justices for the joint government of\r\nIreland in the absence of a Deputy; and both resolved to “join really in\r\nthe King’s Service”—a resolution which they were, for a little while,\r\nto keep. Meantime, Mr. Perkins, “my London Tailor,” had sent over to\r\nDublin an enormous trunk of magnificent wearing-apparel, and a very long\r\nbill; and the retiring Lord Deputy[25] delivered up the King’s Sword and\r\ngovernment of Ireland to the Lord Chancellor and the Earl.\r\n\r\nThis was in October 1629. On the 16th of February following, 1630, Lady\r\nCork died at Dublin.[26] It had “pleased my mercifull God for my manifold\r\nsyns ... to translate out of this mortall world to his gloriows kingdome\r\nof heaven the sowle of my deerest deer wife....”\r\n\r\nThe baby Peggie—ten months old—was still in England; and the ex-baby\r\nRobyn, reared by his country nurse, was just three years old. Had the\r\nlady of the “free and noble spirit,” in those short months spent in\r\nDublin, between October and February, been able to see Robyn again—to\r\nhold him in her arms a little moment—before she died?\r\n\r\nFor a year or two after Lady Cork’s death, the Earl was very busy with\r\nthe government of Ireland and the management of his own family and\r\nestates; and his migrations were for a time to be only from his Dublin\r\ntown house to the Council Chamber and Great Hall of Dublin Castle.\r\nLady Cork had been buried with solemn ceremonial in the Chancel of\r\nSt. Patrick’s Church, in the same tomb with her grandfather the Lord\r\nChancellor Weston and her father Sir Geoffrey Fenton, Secretary of State.\r\nThe business connected with “my deer wive’s ffunerals” occupied the\r\nEarl for some time; and a splendid black marble monument was in course\r\nof erection in the upper end of the chancel of St. Patrick’s. Meantime\r\nthe widower was surrounded by his children;—the Barrymores and their\r\nchildren, and Lady Digby with her comfortable husband, while Lettice\r\nGoring, with or without George Goring, was always coming to and fro from\r\nEngland. Poor Lady Lettice Goring was not a happy woman. She had nearly\r\ndied of smallpox when she was thirteen, and perhaps on this account\r\nher education had been woefully neglected. There was a certain amount\r\nof cleverness in her of a small-natured type; but she was childless,\r\ndelicate, and discontented, with a continual “plaint.” Her younger\r\nsister, Katherine, was of a very different nature. Handsome, intelligent,\r\nand high-spirited, by far the finest character of all the Earl’s\r\ndaughters, Katherine, now that her engagement to Sapcott Beaumont had\r\nbeen broken off, was at sixteen quickly affianced and married to Arthur\r\nJones, Lord Ranelagh’s son, and carried off to Athlone Castle, a gloomy\r\nold Norman castle in Roscommon;—with how small a chance of happiness in\r\nlife she fortunately did not know.\r\n\r\nThe two boys, Lewis and Roger—Lord Kynalmeaky and Lord Broghill—were\r\nfetched to Dublin and entered at Trinity College; and Joan was married to\r\nthe Earl of Kildare as soon as that young nobleman returned to Ireland in\r\ncompany with her brother Dick. The baby Peggie was brought from England\r\nwith her nurse and maid; and sometime in 1631 the two youngest boys,\r\nFrancis and Robert, were brought home; and “my children,” their little\r\nblack satin doublets, and “Mownsier,” their French tutor, began to find a\r\nplace in the Earl’s diary. It was then, too, that the Earl began to make\r\nthose settlements, the first of many, in various counties, on “Robyn”,\r\nand that a son of one of the Earl’s own old servants was engaged “to\r\nattend Robert Boyle.” The minute philosopher, at five years old, had his\r\nown valet.\r\n\r\nAnxieties and triumphs jostled each other in the Dublin town house. Lady\r\nFenton did not long survive her daughter, and a great cavalcade, headed\r\nby the Earl and his sons and sons-in-law, rode to her funeral at Youghal.\r\nIn November 1631 the Earl was made High Treasurer of Ireland[27]; that\r\nwinter, in leisure hours, he must have written his _True Remembrances_,\r\nthe manuscript of which was finished and “commended to posterity” in\r\nJune 1632—just after the Earl, the Lord Chancellor, and the young Earl of\r\nKildare, had been given the Freedom of the City of Dublin. Early in that\r\nyear, Dorothy had married Arthur Loftus and settled down at Rathfarnham,\r\nand that same summer Dick, “my Lord Dungarvan,” in company with Mr. Fry\r\nhis tutor, set off on his foreign travels. Dungarvan’s marriage with\r\nthe daughter and heiress of Lord Clifford was already on the _tapis_.\r\nLord and Lady Clifford lived at Skipton, in Yorkshire; Dungarvan was\r\nto be received in audience by King Charles, and to take Yorkshire on\r\nhis way abroad; and “thaffair,” so dear to the Earl’s heart, was very\r\nsoon to bring him home again. A husband was to be found for Peggie,\r\nnow that she was three years old; and the Lord Chancellor and the Lord\r\nPrimate were to have long confabulations with the Earl on this important\r\nmatter. Kynalmeaky was already proving himself an anxious, brilliant\r\nyoung spendthrift, and was to be sent to sea in the _Ninth Whelp_ to\r\nlearn “navigacon” and “the mathematiques” from that same Captain who\r\nwore the fringed gloves and embroidered night-cap. The sons-in-law were\r\na trial. George Goring was continually borrowing, Kildare perpetually\r\nlosing at dice and cards. He “battered and abused” with marrow-bones the\r\nEarl’s best silver trenchers, and then won £5 from his father-in-law for\r\n“discovering” to him the culprit! Lord Barrymore, after living eighteen\r\nmonths with his wife and all his family under the Earl’s roof, went back\r\nto Castle Lyons without so much as saying thank-you. As for the household\r\nstaff, the “servant trouble” existed then as now. That Christmas of 1632\r\none of the Earl’s scullerymen “did most unfortunately by jesting with\r\nhis knife run my undercook into the belly whereof he instantly died in my\r\nhouse in Dublin”—a most unpleasant domestic episode; and it happened at\r\nthe very moment when the splendid black marble tomb in St Patrick’s had\r\nbeen finished and paid for!\r\n\r\nBut all this was as nothing to the griefs of the next few months; the\r\npremature birth of Lady Digby’s baby under the Earl’s roof, the hurried\r\nchristening before it died, and the death of the young mother,—that\r\nlittle Sarah who, a widow at seventeen, had been married to Lord Digby,\r\nthe Earl’s most comfortable son-in-law, on the Christmas Day before Robyn\r\nwas born.[28]\r\n\r\nIt was a dark summer, the summer of 1633, in the Dublin town house;\r\nand the Earl and his children were still in the first days of their\r\nmourning, when Wentworth, the new Lord Deputy, arrived in Dublin: _A most\r\ncursed man to all Ireland_, wrote the Earl in his diary, _and to me in\r\nparticular_.\r\n\r\nThe story of Wentworth’s government of Ireland, a government “hardly\r\nparalleled in the annals of pro-consulship,”[29] has given material\r\nfor many books; but through all the chapters there runs the underplot\r\nof Wentworth’s personal relations with the Earl of Cork. From the\r\nfirst moment, on that July morning, 1633, when the Earl—the Lord High\r\nTreasurer—set out in his coach to meet the Lord Deputy and his suite\r\n“walking on foot towards the cytty”—a wall of enmity had stood up between\r\nthese two great men. There is no more human reading than the private\r\ndiary record of those uneasy years that followed; and unconsciously, by\r\nmere enumeration of daily incidents, the Earl has made his own character\r\nand the character of Wentworth stand out as clearly as if they were both\r\nalive and facing each other in a Parliament of to-day. There is the\r\ncharacter of the strenuous old Elizabethan Protestant, with its angles\r\nand its softnesses, the man of sixty-seven, who for five-and-forty years\r\nhad been the man on the spot. Royalist to the backbone, he had served\r\nin Ireland three sovereigns in succession. It was the country of his\r\nadoption. To a great extent, he felt he had made it what it was; and now,\r\nin yielding up the sword and government to Wentworth, he was proudly\r\nsatisfied that Ireland was being yielded up in “generall peac and plenty.”\r\n\r\nAnd there is the character of Wentworth, the man who had come—who had\r\nbeen sent—to rule; the much younger man, of more recent education and\r\nmore cultivated tastes, of a different code of living. But he was\r\nas obstinately masterful, and his energy and insolence were that of\r\nmanhood’s prime. He, too, was there to do the King’s service, none the\r\nless fervently that he had been, not so long before, a leader of the\r\npopular party in the English Parliament, and had only recently, so to\r\nspeak, crossed the floor of the House. Already, in that dark head of\r\nhis were schemes and purposes undreamed of in the old Earl’s homely\r\nphilosophy. They were to be unfolded in those confidential letters to\r\nLaud—great schemes, known afterwards as his “policy of Thorough,” his\r\ngovernment of all men by “Reward and Punishment.” But in the meantime,\r\nwith all outward deference and ceremonial, the Earl of Cork hated\r\nWentworth and his government in advance, and Wentworth regarded the Earl\r\nof Cork with personal dislike, for he knew him to be the most important\r\nman in Ireland—a man who would not be subservient; a man in the Lord\r\nDeputy’s path.\r\n\r\nSo the diary tells its own story: the story of the troublous official\r\nlife of the Council Chamber and of Wentworth’s Irish Parliaments; the\r\nstory of Wentworth’s sharp pursuit of the Earl’s titles to his Irish\r\nlands; and the story of the private life in the Earl’s Dublin house,\r\nwith its social duties and family anxieties. Wentworth had married his\r\nthird wife privately, in England, a year after the death of his second\r\nwife, and not long before his departure for Ireland. She had been sent\r\nover to Dublin six months before him, to live rather mysteriously in\r\nDublin Castle, under her own unmarried name—as “Mistress Rhodes.” But\r\nimmediately on Wentworth’s arrival, her identity was revealed: the Lords\r\nJustices were duly presented to the Lord Deputy’s lady, and permitted to\r\nsalute her with a kiss. And the diary records kind visits, and return\r\nvisits, between the Castle and the Earl of Cork’s Dublin town house;\r\nlittle card-parties at the Castle, when the Chancellor and the Treasurer\r\nboth lost sums of money to the Lord Deputy; games of “Mawe,”[30] also\r\nfor money, and private theatricals acted by the Lord Deputy’s gentlemen.\r\nThe old Earl sat through a tragedy, on one occasion, which he found\r\n“tragicall” indeed, because there was no time to have any supper. And\r\nthen, but six months after Wentworth’s arrival, there came the first hint\r\nof the trouble about Lady Cork’s black marble tomb in St Patrick’s.\r\n\r\nMr. Bagwell has pointed out[31] how, to the old Elizabethan, whose\r\n“Protestantism was not of the Laudian type,” there was nothing amiss in\r\nthe fact of a Communion-table standing detached in the middle of the\r\nChurch. The Earl, in erecting his monument, had indeed improved the\r\nChancel of St. Patrick’s, which had been earthen-floored, and often\r\nin wet weather “overflown.” He had raised it, with three stone steps\r\nand a pavement of hewn stones, “whereon,” the Earl wrote to Laud, “the\r\ncommunion-table now stands very dry and gracefully.” Laud himself had\r\nfound it hard to interfere, in the face of general opinion supported by\r\ntwo Archbishops.[32] But Wentworth was obdurate, and the King himself was\r\nappealed to. It was considered a scandal that the Cork tomb should remain\r\n“sett in the place where the high altar anciently stood.”[33] In the end,\r\nthe great black marble monument was taken down, stone by stone; and in\r\nMarch 1635 Wentworth was able to write to Laud: “The Earl of Cork’s tomb\r\nis now quite removed. How he means to dispose of it I know not; but up\r\nit is put in boxes, as if it were marchpanes or banqueting stuffs, going\r\ndown to the christening of my young master in the country.”\r\n\r\nThe reference to “my young master” is evidently to Lady Kildare’s baby,\r\nwhose birth—and the fact that it was a boy—was the event of the moment\r\nin the Cork household: indeed, the old Earl had a bet on with Sir James\r\nErskine, on the subject. In November 1635 the tomb had been re-erected\r\nwhere it now stands, in the south side of the Choir, and outwardly,\r\nat least, after a long struggle, the matter was ended. Lord Cork knew\r\nnothing of that sneer in Wentworth’s letter to Laud about the marchpanes\r\nand the banqueting stuffs; and when Wentworth arrived at the Earl’s\r\nhouse one evening in December 1635—he was rather fond of dropping in\r\nunexpectedly—and joined the Earl and his family at supper, the diary\r\nrecords that the Lord Deputy “very nobly and neighbourlyke satt down\r\nand took part of my super without any addicon.” But between July 1633\r\nand that December evening of 1635, many things had happened in the Cork\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the _Ninth Whelp_ had been obliged to report that Lewis,\r\nmy Lord Kynalmeaky, had run badly into debt at Bristol. Dungarvan had\r\nbeen recalled, and sent to England with his tutor, about “thaffair”\r\nof his marriage with Mrs. Elizabeth Clifford. George Goring had been\r\nassisted with money to buy a troop of horse; and “our colonel”—and poor\r\nLettice after him—had sailed for the Netherlands, and soon settled at The\r\nHague. Little Peggie, her prospective jointure and husband provided, had\r\nbeen put meanwhile, with Mary, under the care of Sir Randall and Lady\r\nClayton at Cork; and Mr. Perkins, the London tailor, had sent the Earl\r\nhis new Parliament robes of brocaded satin and cloth of gold. Dorothy\r\nLoftus’s first baby had been born at Rathfarnham, and Katherine Jones’s\r\nfirst baby at Athlone Castle. Both were girls; hence, that wager of the\r\nEarl’s that his daughter Kildare’s next baby would be a boy. The Earl of\r\nKildare, with his dice and cards, had been causing everybody anxiety; and\r\nthere was a quarrel about family property going on between the Digby and\r\nOffaley family and the “Faerie Earle.” Wentworth had interfered, and in\r\nthe autumn of 1634 Kildare, having taking offence, had “stolen privately\r\non shipboard,” leaving his wife and children and a household of about\r\nsixty persons “without means or monies.” The delinquent was very soon to\r\ncome home again; but late in 1634 the old Earl had broken up the Kildare\r\nestablishment and settled his daughter and her children in his own newly\r\nbuilt house at Maynooth, riding there with her, and dining with her “for\r\nthe first time in the new parlour”, and sending her two fat oxen “to\r\nbegin her housekeeping there.”\r\n\r\nDick, “my Lord Dungarvan,” on the other hand, had been proving himself\r\na very satisfactory son: not very clever, perhaps, but eminently\r\ngood-natured and sensible. He had acquitted himself admirably in England,\r\nwriting comfortable letters to his father, who was much gratified to\r\nhear that his boy had taken part in the Royal Masque. It must have been\r\nthe great Royal Masque in Whitehall, on Shrove Tuesday night, February\r\n18th, 1634: the _Cælum Britannicum_, which followed on the still greater\r\nMasque of the Inns of Court. The words were by the poet Carew, the music\r\nby Henry Lawes, who had set Milton’s _Comus_; and the scenery was by\r\nInigo Jones. The King himself and fourteen of his chief nobles were\r\nthe Masquers, and the juvenile parts were taken by ten young lords and\r\nnoblemen’s sons. No wonder that the old Earl was proud of “Dick”.\r\n\r\nAnd Dungarvan had made such good progress with his wooing that in July\r\na pretty little letter, neatly wax-sealed on floss-silk, had come to\r\nthe Earl of Cork, beginning: “My Lord,—Now I have the honour to be your\r\ndaughter.” In September 1634 the indefatigable _Ninth Whelp_ brought\r\nDungarvan and his bride to Ireland. The Earl met them at their landing,\r\nand drove them back in triumph—three coaches full—to his town house in\r\nDublin. All the available members of the family, little Robert Boyle\r\nincluded, were gathered to welcome the new sister-in-law. It was a\r\ngreat alliance, in which Wentworth himself, by marriage a kinsman of\r\nthe Cliffords, had lent a hand. For the time being, it was to draw the\r\nLord Deputy into the circle of the Earl’s family, though the personal\r\nrelations between the Deputy and the Earl were to become even more\r\nstrained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSCHOOLDAYS AT ETON\r\n\r\n    “Where the Provost at that time was Sir Henry Wotton, a\r\n    person that was not only a fine gentleman himself, but very\r\n    well skilled in the art of making others so.”—ROBERT BOYLE’S\r\n    _Philaretus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December 1634, after nearly seven years’ absence, the Earl of Cork and\r\nhis family returned to the House of Lismore. They had not been gathered\r\nthere, as a family, since the April of 1628, when the Earl and his wife\r\nand daughters set out on their journey to London. But Parliament was\r\nadjourned, and Dungarvan and his wife were with them, and everything\r\npointed to their spending Christmas in their home of homes: “And there,\r\nGod willing, wee intend,” wrote the Earl the day before they left\r\nDublin to Lady Clifford at Skipton Castle in Yorkshire—“to keep a merry\r\nChristmas among our neighbors, and to eate to the noble family of Skipton\r\nin fatt does and Carps, and to drinke your healthe in the best wyne\r\nwee can gett....” His new daughter-in-law, he says, “looks, and likes\r\nIreland, very well.” She was every day winning the affection and respect\r\nof the “best sort of people”—her husband’s and her father-in-law’s most\r\nof all. Incidentally—for he was treading on delicate ground owing to the\r\nfamily connection between Wentworth and the Cliffords—the Earl mentions\r\nthat he is being “sharply persued” in his Majesty’s Court of the Star\r\nChamber about his titles to the college and lands of Youghal; and he is\r\nonly sorry that “this attempt” should be made upon him just at the time\r\nof his daughter-in-law’s arrival in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt is not two hundred miles by rail from Dublin to Lismore; but in those\r\ndays travelling was slow and difficult; and the Cork cavalcade—the family\r\ncoach and the gay company of horsemen surrounding it—were four days\r\nupon the road. Robert Boyle never forgot that eventful journey.[34] The\r\nEnglish daughter-in-law and her attendant lady, and the old Earl and\r\nall his five sons, were of the party, the youngest, Robert, not eight\r\nyears old. Each night they “lay” at hospitable houses on the road, and\r\nall went well till, on the fourth day after passing Clonmell, as they\r\nwere crossing the “Four Miles Water”, their coach was overturned in\r\nmid-stream. Robyn remembered every detail of the adventure: how he had\r\nbeen left sitting alone in the coach, “with only a post-boy,” and how one\r\nof his father’s gentlemen, “very well horsed,” recognising the danger,\r\nrode alongside and insisted on carrying the little fellow—very unwilling\r\nto leave the apparent safety of the inside of the coach—in his arms over\r\nthe rapid water; how the water proved so much swifter and deeper than\r\nanybody had imagined that horses and riders were “violently hurried down\r\nthe stream,” and the unloaded and empty coach was quickly overturned.\r\nThe coach horses struggled till they broke their harnesses, and with\r\ndifficulty saved themselves by swimming.\r\n\r\nSo much for the memory of a little sensitive eight-year-old. The Earl’s\r\ndiary record is brief and to the point. His coach was “overthrown”,\r\nhis horses were “in danger of drowning”, but they all, God be praised,\r\narrived safely at Lismore, and the journey had cost him £24.\r\n\r\nChristmas was kept at Lismore, and the last two days of the old year at\r\nCastle Lyons, where the Earl’s son-in-law, Barrymore, feasted them most\r\nliberally. He could scarcely have done less, after that eighteen-months’\r\nvisit to the Earl’s town house in Dublin. And so this year ended.\r\n\r\nWith the New Year 1635 came the Claytons from Cork, bringing Mary and\r\nlittle Peggie on a visit to their father. A week or two later the\r\nEarl went back alone to Dublin for the last session of Parliament,\r\nleaving Dungarvan and his wife to keep house at Lismore; and the four\r\nboys—Kynalmeaky, Broghill, Frank and little Robyn—were all left under the\r\ncharge of their tutor, Mr. Wilkinson, who was also the Earl’s chaplain.\r\n\r\nIt was a severe winter: the very day after the Earl set out from Lismore\r\nthere began to fall at Clonmell “the greatest snow that ever any man\r\nnow living did see in Ireland.” The House of Lismore must have stood,\r\nvery white and quiet, looking down over the precipice into the swirling\r\nBlackwater below it. All about it, white and silent too, lay the gardens\r\nand orchards, the fishponds and park lands, and the wooded wildernesses;\r\nand the mountains beyond were hidden in falling snows. The roads could\r\nnot have been easy riding between Clonmell and Dublin, but the Earl and\r\nhis servants reached Dublin in safety, and he sent back by Dungarvan’s\r\nman “two new books of Logick” for the versatile Kynalmeaky’s further\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nKildare had come back to Dublin also, and not too soon; for he and his\r\nyoung wife were to make up their differences over a little grave. Early\r\nin March their eldest little girl died under the Earl’s roof in Dublin;\r\nand a few days later Lady Kildare’s boy was born—the “young master” of\r\nWentworth’s vindictive letter to Laud.\r\n\r\nBut spring was at hand, and the Lismore orchards were in blossom. The\r\nEarl was busy buying more lands and manors to be settled on Robyn, and\r\nwriting to his English friends about a “ffrench gent” to accompany his\r\nsons Kynalmeaky and Broghill as “governour” on their foreign travels.\r\nGreat sheet-winged hawks, also, were brought “to fflye for our sports”;\r\nand in July Lord Clifford and his suite arrived from Yorkshire on\r\na visit to Lismore. The Earl of Cork was in his element. A great\r\nhunting-party had been arranged, and the huntsmen filled the lodge in the\r\npark. Dungarvan and his wife—Lord Clifford’s daughter and heiress—the\r\nBarrymores, and Katharine and Arthur Jones, were all gathered at Lismore.\r\nLord Clifford was to see this Munster home at its very best; its terraces\r\nand rose-gardens aflame with colour, its orchards heavy with fruit,\r\nits pigeon-houses and watermills and fishponds and the great turreted\r\nwalls—all the “re-edifications” in fact, that had been the work of years.\r\nAnd the seventeenth-century interior must have been as imposing; for\r\nthere was furniture of crimson velvet, fringed with silver, and furniture\r\nof black and scarlet velvet brocade. The walls were hung with tapestry,\r\nthe floors were spread with Turkey rugs. There were high-backed chairs\r\nand low-backed chairs, and Indian embroideries, and “long cushions” for\r\nthe embrasured window-seats. The Earl’s hospitable tables were furnished\r\nwith fish, beef, venison, and huge all-containing pies—to be washed\r\ndown by Bordeaux wine, usquebagh, and _aqua vitæ_; and they groaned\r\nalso beneath their burden of silver;—flagons and trenchers, “covered\r\nsalts,” “costerns,” kettles and ladles of silver and silver gilt; while\r\nthe “ewers and basons” in the bedrooms were of silver, the great gilded\r\nbeds hung with scarlet cloth and silver lace and the ceilings of the\r\nchildren’s nursery and the Earl’s “studdie” were of “fretwork”—their\r\nwalls of “Spanish white”.\r\n\r\nKatharine and Arthur Jones went back to Athlone early in September.\r\nThe hunting-party was dispersed, and the House of Lismore was emptying\r\nagain. It must have been on one of those autumn days before Katharine\r\nleft Lismore that there happened the little “foolish” incident about\r\nRobyn and the plums: an incident which the elder sister would tell, long\r\nafterwards, when Robert Boyle had made his world-wide reputation, and she\r\nand he were growing old together in the house in Pall Mall.[35]\r\n\r\nDungarvan’s wife had already made a special pet of Francis, who was\r\nindeed a lovable and happy-tempered boy. But it was Robyn who was his\r\nsister Kate’s favourite. She seems to have felt a special tenderness\r\nfor this little fellow with a little independent character of his own,\r\nso different from all his brothers: a little fellow with a stutter,\r\nattributed by his family to his habit of mimicking some children with\r\nwhom he had been allowed to play; a little fellow who was “studious” at\r\neight years old, and so hopelessly and tactlessly truthful that the old\r\nEarl—fond old disciplinarian that he was—had never been able to “find him\r\nin a lie in all his life.”\r\n\r\nAnd so with the plums. Lady Dungarvan, in delicate health, was being\r\npetted by all the family; and Katharine Jones had given “strict orders”\r\nthat the fruit of a certain plum tree in the Lismore garden should be\r\npreserved for Lady Dungarvan’s use. Robyn had gone into the garden, and,\r\n“ignoring the prohibition,” had been eating the plums. And when his\r\nsister Kate taxed him, “by way of aggravation,” with having eaten “half\r\na dozen plums,”—“Nay, truly, sister,” answered he simply to her, “I have\r\neaten half a score.”[36]\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkinson and a certain “Mownsier” had between them taught Robyn\r\nto speak some French and Latin and to write a fair hand; and now that\r\nhe was in his ninth year, and Frank twelve years old, they were to be\r\nsent to Eton. The Earl had been in correspondence for some time with his\r\nold friend Sir Henry Wotton, not only about this matter, but about a\r\n“governour” who should take Kynalmeaky and Broghill abroad. Accordingly\r\non September 9, 1635, a few days after their sister Katharine and Arthur\r\nJones had left Lismore, Francis and Robert, with Carew their personal\r\nservant, under the charge of the Earl’s own confidential servant,\r\nMr. Thomas Badnedge, left Lismore for Youghal, there to embark for\r\nEngland, “to be schooled and bredd at Eaton.” Badnedge was to carry\r\nthe purse, with £50 in it, and if he wanted any more was to draw upon\r\nMr. Burlamachy, the Lord Mayor of London. And the Earl gave the boys\r\nat parting £3 between them: “the great God of Heaven”, he wrote in his\r\ndiary, “bless, guyde and protect them!”\r\n\r\nIt was not till September 24 that the little party actually sailed from\r\nYoughal, for they waited a whole week for a wind, and then they were\r\n“beat back again” by a storm. But at last, “though the Irish coasts were\r\nthen sufficiently infested with Turkish gallies,” they reached Bristol in\r\nsafety, having touched at Ilfracombe and Minehead on the way. There was a\r\nshort stay “to repose and refresh themselves” at Bristol, and then their\r\njourney was “shaped” direct for Eton College. It was of course a journey\r\nby coach-roads; and their first sight of English scenery was in late\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at Eton on October 2; and Mr. Badnedge delivered the two\r\nboys safely into the charge of Sir Henry Wotton. Their “tuicon” was to be\r\nundertaken by Mr. John Harrison, the “chief schoolmaster.”\r\n\r\nShortly after their arrival, Francis penned a little letter to his\r\nfather, the Earl of “Korke,” to be carried back to Ireland by one of\r\ntheir escort. He began on bended knees with hearty prayers, and went on\r\nto say that he had no news to tell except some things he had observed\r\non his travels, but these he would leave the bearer of his letter to\r\nnarrate, “in regard I am incited by my school exercise.” Sir “Hary\r\nWutton” had been very kind to them, entertaining them the first day of\r\ntheir arrival at his own table. He had also put at their disposal “a\r\nchamber of his owne with a bedd furnished afore our own wilbe furnished.”\r\nThe young lords at Eton had also been most friendly, especially the Earl\r\nof Peterborough’s son, with whom Frank and Robyn were, for the present,\r\nto dine and sup. And there was a postscript to say that Mr. Badnedge had\r\nbeen very kind “in all our travels,” and had sent them a supply of linen\r\nfrom London after their arrival, for which they were “much bound to him.”\r\n\r\nA few days later Mr. John Harrison, the “chief schoolmaster,” also wrote\r\nto the Earl of Cork, a letter concise, dignified, and satisfactory.\r\n\r\nHe confirmed the arrival at Eton of the Earl’s two sons, “whoe, as they\r\nindured their journeye both by sea and land, beyond what a man would\r\nexpect from such little ones so, since their arrival, the place seemed to\r\nbe suiting them wonderfully well”. He tells the Earl that “Mr. Provost”\r\nhad been so kind as to put the boys under his care, and lets the Earl\r\nknow, in parenthesis, that he, John Harrison, is at present the “Rector”\r\nof the school: “I will carefully see them supplyed with such things as\r\ntheir occasions in the colledge shall require, and endeavour to sett them\r\nforward in learninge the best I can.”\r\n\r\nBut it was from Carew,[37] the boys’ personal servant, that the Earl was\r\nto hear all about everything. Carew’s first letter touched lightly on\r\nthe “long and tedious navigation and great travels by land,” and went\r\nstraight to the subject of subjects—“my two young masters.” They had been\r\nthere only a few days, but they were “very well beloved for their civill\r\nand transparent carriage towards all sorts, and specially my sweet Mr.\r\nRobert, who gained the love of all.” Sir Henry Wotton had been “much\r\ntaken with him for his discourse of Ireland and of his travails, and\r\nhe admired that he would observe or take notice of those things that he\r\ndiscoursed off.”\r\n\r\nThen followed an account of Sir Henry Wotton’s kind reception of the\r\nboys, and the lending of his furnished chamber till their own should be\r\nready: “We injoy it yett,” says Carew, “which is a great favor.” The boys\r\nhad dined several times already with Sir Henry Wotton. They were very\r\n“jocond”, although they showed a “studious desire”, and they had “very\r\ncarefull and reverend masters.” There is just a hint of home-sickness,\r\na longing for the sight of the old Earl and the brothers and sisters\r\nand the roughly splendid Irish life; but Carew quickly goes on to tell\r\nthe “Order of the Colledge,” especially “touching my young masters’\r\nessence.” The boys dine in hall, with the rest of the boarders;[38] and\r\nthe Earl of Northampton’s four sons, and the two sons of the Earl of\r\nPeterborough, with other “Knights’ sons” are at the same table. “They\r\nsitt permiscously—noe observing of place or qualitie”; and at night they\r\nsupped in their own rooms, Mr. Francis and Mr. Robert supping with the\r\nEarl of Peterborough’s sons, providing, of course, their own commons.\r\nCarew mentions the “fasting nights” and the fact that the College allows\r\nno meat to be cooked on Fridays or Saturdays; and he hints that the\r\nCollege commissariat requires a good deal of supplementing. Master Robert\r\nis too busy with his lessons to write a letter, but sends his love and\r\nduty: “They are upp every morning at half an hour afore 6, and soe to\r\nscoole to prayers.”\r\n\r\nSir Henry Wotton, the Provost of Eton[39] of that day, was nearing the\r\nend of his eventful, chequered life when Robert Boyle, not yet nine years\r\nold, came under his care. He was indeed a contemporary of the old Earl,\r\nand a Kentish man as well—one of a fine old Kentish stock; but no two men\r\ncould have been more unlike. He had taken his B.A. at Oxford, and with a\r\nslender purse set out on his seven years’ wanderings in European cities,\r\nthe very same year in which Mr. Richard Boyle had turned the lucky ring\r\non his finger and landed on Irish shores. But that had been forty-seven\r\nyears before—back in the mists; and the years between those youthful\r\nwanderings and this pleasant old age in the Provost’s lodging at Eton\r\nhad been years of risky secret missions and ill-paid political intrigue.\r\nHe had been private secretary to Essex in London, private correspondent\r\nabroad, Ambassador at Venice. In those years, many a fine intellect with\r\nbig ambitions had gone under. Sir Henry had come off better than many,\r\nin spite of his slender means and an undeniable weakness for libraries\r\nand laboratories and picture galleries in the intervals of diplomacy. It\r\nwas he who had been sent by the Duke of Tuscany on the secret mission\r\nto Edinburgh to tell James VI that he was going to be poisoned, and to\r\ncarry with him the little packet of Italian antidotes, not known at\r\nthat time in the Scottish pharmacopœia. He had stayed three months with\r\nthe Scottish King; and no wonder that when James ascended the throne of\r\nEngland Sir Henry Wotton was one of the men then in London whom the King\r\ndesired to see. He was a favourite at Court; and his lifelong homage to\r\nthe Princess Elizabeth, the unhappy Queen of Bohemia, is well known.[40]\r\n\r\nHe had risen to great things, and might have risen to greater still if it\r\nhad not been for one brilliant Latin epigram written in an album. Even\r\nKing James, with pleasant memories of a packet of antidotes and a most\r\ndelightful guest in Stirling Castle, found it hard to forgive the Latin\r\nepigram—“a merriment,” poor Wotton had called it—written in an album in\r\nan indiscreet moment many years before, and officiously forwarded from\r\nAugsburg to the Court of London: “_An Ambassador is an honest man sent to\r\nlie abroad for the good of his country_.” It is said to have ruined Sir\r\nHenry Wotton’s diplomatic chances; and when, after some other missions,\r\nhe came home in 1624, it was as a penniless man still, with plans of\r\nliterary work and a sufficient stock of memories grave and gay. He had\r\nconsorted with princes and statesmen, with artists, men of science, and\r\nmen of letters. He had worked for Essex and known Raleigh, and Francis\r\nBacon was his cousin. Among his friends abroad he had counted Beza,\r\nCasaubon, Arminius and Kepler. He had watched Kepler at work in his\r\nlaboratory, and he had supplied Bacon with facts. And when Bacon sent him\r\nthree copies of his _Novum Organum_ when it first appeared, Sir Henry\r\nsent one of the copies to Kepler.\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas Murray died, and Sir Henry Wotton was selected, out of many\r\ncandidates, for the Provostship of Eton, he was so poor that he was\r\nobliged to borrow money to enable him to settle down there. King James\r\nwould have granted him a dispensation, but he preferred to conform to the\r\nrule that the Provost of Eton must be a man in Holy Orders. He had been\r\nduly ordained deacon, and, being a man of liberal views, had steered “a\r\nmiddle way between Calvinism and Arminianism.”[41]\r\n\r\nWhen the two young sons of the Earl of Cork arrived at Eton, Sir Henry\r\nWotton had been Provost for ten years, and Eton could scarcely imagine\r\nitself without him. With a royal pension in addition to his Provostship,\r\nand assisted by a strong staff of Fellows of the College—the learned\r\nHales, John Harrison and the rest—he was taking life easily, in the\r\nevening of his days, among his books and curios, his Italian pictures,\r\nand those manuscripts—biographies of Donne and Luther, and the History\r\nof England,—which he always meant to finish and never did. He was not\r\nquite so active as when he had first come among them with his new views\r\nof teaching, and had put up the picture of Venice, where he had lived\r\nso long as Ambassador, and had hung on the wooden pillars of the lower\r\nschools his “choicely drawn” portraits of Greek and Latin orators and\r\npoets and historians, for the little Eton boys to gaze at with round\r\nEnglish eyes; but his familiar figure was still a daily presence, coming\r\nand going amongst them in his furred and embroidered gown, “dropping\r\nsome choyce Greek or Latin apophthegm” for the benefit of the youngsters\r\nin class. He was still a “constant cherisher” of schoolboyhood, taking\r\nthe “hopeful youths” into his own especial care, having them at his own\r\nhospitable table, picking out the plodding boys and the boys of genius,\r\nand himself teaching best in his own memorable talk. He liked to indulge\r\nin reminiscences of Italy—“that delicat Piece of the Worlde”; and he\r\nsometimes looked wistfully Londonwards, though in his gentle, deprecatory\r\nway he spoke of it, especially in November, as a “fumie citie.” In his\r\nlast years he nursed hopes that he might succeed to the mastership of\r\nthe Savoy; meantime, from his Provost’s Lodging, he could look across\r\nthe “meandering Thames and sweete meadows,”[42] to the great pile of\r\nWindsor Castle in its “antient magnificence”; and he read and ruminated\r\nand smoked—he smoked a little too much, according to his friend Izaak\r\nWalton—and counted his “idle hours not idly spent” when he could sit\r\nquietly fishing with Izaak Walton in the river-bend above the shooting\r\nfields, then, as now, known as Black Pots. When Robert Boyle went to Eton\r\nin 1635, to be an Eton boy meant not only being “grounded in learning” by\r\nsuch men as Hales and Harrison, but being “schooled and bred” under the\r\ndaily influence of this soft, rich, delightful personality.\r\n\r\nThe two boys were known in the school as Boyle _A_ and Boyle _I_: Robert\r\nwas Boyle _I_. According to Carew, they must have grown with astonishing\r\nrapidity during their first months at Eton. Mr. Francis was not only\r\ntall, but “very proportionable in his limbs,” and grew daily liker to\r\nhis brother, Lord Dungarvan. He was not so fond of his books as “my most\r\nhonoured and affectionate Mr. Robert, who was as good at his lessons as\r\nboys double his age.” An usher, “a careful man”, was helping them with\r\ntheir lessons, and Carew was keeping an eye on the usher. Versions and\r\ndictamens in French and Latin filled their time, and Carew could not\r\npersuade them to “affect the Irish,” though Robert seems to have shown a\r\nfaint, intermittent interest in that language.[43] As for Mr. Robert, he\r\nwas “very fatt, and very jovial, and pleasantly merry, and of ye rarest\r\nmemory that I ever knew. He prefers Learninge afore all other virtues and\r\npleasures. The Provost does admire him for his excellent genius.” They\r\nhad acted a play in the College, and Robert had been among those chosen\r\nto take part in it. “He came uppon ye stage,” wrote Carew, exultant, to\r\nthe Earl of Cork; “he had but a mute part, but for the gesture of his\r\nbody and the order of his pace, he did bravely.”\r\n\r\nThe little fellow was not yet nine years old, and his stutter must\r\nhave made it highly desirable that the part should be “mute”; but “Mr.\r\nProvost” had already made choice of a “very sufficient man” to teach\r\nboth the boys to play the viol and to sing, and also to “helpe my Master\r\nRobert’s defect in pronontiation.” Carew was afraid the study of music,\r\nwhich “elevats the spirits,” might hinder their more serious lessons;\r\nthough up to that time the conduct of both boys had been exemplary. They\r\nhad said their prayers regularly and been equally polite to everybody,\r\nand were very neat in their “aparelling, kembing, and washing.” The elder\r\nbrother had been laid up with “a cowld that he tooke in the scoole,”\r\nwhich Carew attributed entirely to the fact that he had outgrown his\r\nclothes; and Mr. Perkins, the London tailor, had been “mighty backward”\r\nin sending their new suits. Even with a bad cold, Frank was his usual\r\npleasant, merry self; and when Mr. Provost, according to his custom,\r\nprescribed “a little phisique,” the boy drank it cheerfully to the last\r\ndrop—and “rejected it immediately after.” Sir Henry Wotton wrote himself\r\nto the Earl, describing the whole episode with an accuracy of detail\r\nworthy of Kepler’s laboratory.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Sir Henry himself had assured the Earl that the “spiritay\r\nRobyn’s” voice and pronunciation had been taken in hand by the Master of\r\nthe Choristers. Robyn also had caught cold that first winter at Eton. He\r\nhad “taken a conceit against his breakfast, being alwaies curious of his\r\nmeat, and so going fasting to church.” But on this occasion, such was the\r\nspiritay Robyn’s popularity, that the whole College seems to have risen\r\nin protest against Mr. Provost’s prescription of “a little phisique.” And\r\nRobert recovered without it, and “continued still increasing in virtues.”\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat surprising that the younger brother should have been the\r\nfavourite, for it was Francis Boyle who had the “quick, apprehensive\r\nwit,” and whose delight was in hunting and horsemanship; and it was Robyn\r\nwho dissuaded him, exhorting his elder brother to learning in his youth,\r\n“for,” says he, “there can be nothing more profitable and honourable.”\r\nWith his “fayre amiable countenance,” this child of nine, according to\r\nthe ebullient Carew, was “wise, discreet, learned and devout; and not\r\nsuch devotion as is accustomed in children, but withall in Sincerity he\r\nhonours God and prefers Him in all his actions.”[44]\r\n\r\nIt is very certain that the spiritay Robyn was not fond of games. There\r\nis no enthusiasm for active sports in his _Philaretus_, not even of a\r\ncertain sport that the boys engaged in on winter evenings in the hall,\r\nfor which every recent comer was obliged to “find the candles”; and a\r\nvery expensive time for candles it was, according to Carew. But Mr.\r\nRobert learnt to “play on music and to sing”, and “to talk Latin he\r\nhas very much affected.” And it speaks very well for both Frank and\r\nRobyn that, their tastes being so unlike, they remained such excellent\r\nfriends. “Never since they arrived,” according to Carew, had two ill\r\nwords passed between them; which he thought was rare to see, “specially\r\nwhen the younger exceeds the elder in some qualities.” Some of the noble\r\nbrothers in the College were continually quarrelling; but “the peace of\r\nGod is with my masters.” It had been noticed even at the Fellows’ table:\r\n“Never were sweeter and civiller gents seen in the Colledge than Mr.\r\nBoyles.” The only thing in which they do not seem to have excelled was in\r\nletter-writing. Master Frank could not write to the Earl because his hand\r\nshook; and Master Robyn could not write because he had hurt his thumb.\r\n\r\nAnd so winter and spring passed, and the summer came, and with it\r\n“breaking-time” at Eton. Mr. Provost, Mr. Harrison, and everybody else\r\nwent away. The two boys, and Carew with them, spent their holidays with\r\ntheir sister Lettice in Sussex. It could not have been a cheerful visit,\r\nthough Carew assured the Earl that there was “nothing wanting to afford\r\na good and pleasant entertainment if my honourable Lady had not been\r\nvisited with her continuall guest, griefe and melancholy.” So extremely\r\nmelancholy was the Lady Lettice Goring during this visit that it made\r\nthe two boys “cry often to looke upon her.” And yet they must have made\r\na pretty pair to gladden the eyes of an invalid woman. For Mr. Perkins,\r\nthe London tailor, had sent them some fine new clothes—little shirts\r\nwith laced bands and cuffs, two scarlet suits without coats, and two\r\ncloth-of-silver doublets.\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle’s own recollections of Eton were written a good many years\r\nafter he left it. He always remembered with gratitude the kindness\r\nof Mr. John Harrison, in whose house, in that chamber that was so\r\nlong in furnishing, the two boys lived—except for some holidays at\r\n“breaking-time,” usually spent in Sussex—from October 1635 to November\r\n1638.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning John Harrison must have recognised that in “Boyle\r\n_I_” he had no ordinary boy to deal with. He saw a “spiritay” little\r\nfellow, with a fair, amiable countenance, a slight stammer, which the\r\nchild did his best to amend, and the unstudied civilities of manner of a\r\nlittle prince. According to Boyle himself, Mr. Harrison saw “some aptness\r\nand much willingness” in him to learn; and this chief schoolmaster\r\nresolved to teach his pupil by “all the gentlest ways of encouragement.”\r\nHe began by often dispensing with his attendance at school in ordinary\r\nschool hours, and taking the trouble to teach him “privately and\r\nfamiliarly in his own chamber.”\r\n\r\n“He would often, as it were, cloy him with fruit and sweetmeats, and\r\nthose little dainties that age is greedy of, that by preventing the want,\r\nhe might lessen both his value and desire of them. He would sometimes\r\ngive him, unasked, play-days, and oft bestow upon him such balls and tops\r\nand other implements of idleness as he had taken away from others that\r\nhad unduly used them. He would sometimes commend others before him to\r\nrouse his emulation, and oftentimes give him commendations before others\r\nto engage his endeavours to deserve them. Not to be tedious, he was\r\ncareful to instruct him in such an affable, kind, and gentle way, that he\r\neasily prevailed with him to consider studying not so much as a duty of\r\nobedience to his superiors, but as a way to purchase for himself a most\r\ndelightsome and invaluable good.”[45]\r\n\r\nAll which means that Mr. Harrison was making a very interesting\r\nexperiment, and that his system happened to succeed in the case of Robert\r\nBoyle. The boy learned his “scholar’s task” very easily; and his spare\r\nhours were spent so absorbedly over the books he was reading that Mr.\r\nHarrison was sometimes obliged to “force him out to play.” And what were\r\nthe books that were read with such zest? It was, Robert Boyle says, the\r\naccidental perusal of _Quintus Curtius_ that first made him in love with\r\n“other than pedantick books”; and in after life he used to assert that\r\nhe owed more to _Quintus Curtius_ than ever Alexander did: that he had\r\ngained more from the history of Alexander’s conquests than ever Alexander\r\nhad done from the conquests themselves.[46]\r\n\r\nHis other recollections of his Eton schooldays are for the most part of\r\naccidents that happened to him there. He was not so good a horseman as\r\nhis brother Frank. Once he fell from his horse, and the animal trod so\r\nnear to his throat as to make a hole in his neckband, “which he long\r\nafter preserved for a remembrance.” Another time his nag took fright\r\nas he was riding through a town, and reared upright on his hinder feet\r\nagainst a wall; and the boy just saved himself by slipping off. Yet\r\na third time he nearly met his death by a “potion” given him “by an\r\napothecary’s error”; and it is interesting, in the light of what happened\r\nand did not happen in Boyle’s later life, to hear that “this accident\r\nmade him long after apprehend more from the physicians than the disease,\r\nand was possibly the occasion that made him afterwards so inquisitively\r\napply himself to the study of physick, that he might have the less need\r\nof them that profess it.”[47] The fourth and last of this almost Pauline\r\nenumeration of disasters was the falling, one evening, of the greater\r\npart of the wall of the boys’ bedroom in Mr. Harrison’s house. The two\r\nbrothers had gone early to their room; Robyn was already tucked into the\r\nbig four-post bed, with its “feather bedd, boulster, and two pillows,”\r\nand the curtains of “blew perpetuana with lace and frenge”,[48] and Frank\r\nwas talking with some other boys round the fire when, without a moment’s\r\nwarning, the wall of the room fell in, the ceiling with it, carrying bed,\r\nchairs, books and furniture from the room above. A bigger boy rescued\r\nFrank from the debris and dust, the chair in which he had been sitting\r\nbroken to pieces, and his clothes torn off his back; and Robyn, the\r\nfuture chemist, peeping from the blew-perpetuana curtains, remembered\r\nto wrap his head in the sheet, so that it might serve “as a strainer,\r\nthrough which none but the purer air could find a passage.”\r\n\r\nIt is observable that there is no mention of any of those accidents in\r\nthe letters to the Earl of Cork from either the Provost or the boys’\r\npersonal servant, Carew. Perhaps it was as well that the Earl, much\r\nharassed at home, should not be told everything that was happening at\r\nEton. As it was, he knew too much. Some go-between—Mr. Perkins, the\r\ntailor, or somebody equally officious—must have told the Earl in what\r\nmanner Carew—“poor unmeriting me”, as Carew called himself in one of\r\nhis fascinating letters to the Earl—had been utilising his idle hours\r\nby the meandering Thames. Frank and Robyn, and Carew with them, were\r\nspending their holidays with Lady Lettice Goring, when one morning Sir\r\nHenry Wotton, sitting in his study at Eton, received a letter from\r\nthe Earl of Cork. The contents came as a thunderbolt. “Truly, my good\r\nLord,” Sir Henry Wotton wrote back to the Earl, “I was shaken with\r\nsuch an amazement at the first percussion thereof, that, till a second\r\nperusal, I was doubtfull whether I had readd aright.” For everybody in\r\nthe college was so persuaded of young Mr. Carew’s discretion and temper\r\nand zeal in his charge, and “whole carriadge of himself,” that it would\r\nbe “harde to stamp us with any new impression.” However, Mr. Provost had\r\nsomewhat reluctantly put away his pipe and “bestowed a Daye in a little\r\nInquisitiveness.” And he had found that the Earl, in Dublin, was quite\r\nright; that between Carew and a certain “yonge Mayed, dawghter to our\r\nunder baker—” and Mr. Provost could not but own that she was pretty—there\r\nhad passed certain civil, not to say amorous, language. The old Provost\r\nwas evidently disposed to look leniently on this particular foolish\r\npair. Had he not himself once, in his youth, written a little poem which\r\nbegan—\r\n\r\n    O faithless world, and thy most faithless part\r\n        A woman’s heart!\r\n    ...\r\n    Why was she born to please, or I to trust\r\n        Words writ in dust?[49]\r\n\r\nHowever, Sir Henry told the Earl he was going to talk to Carew on his\r\nreturn from Sussex, and warn him how careful, in his position, he ought\r\nto be; and he would write again to the Earl after seeing Carew. But, in\r\nthe meantime he wished to reserve judgment: “For truely theare can not be\r\na more tender attendant about youre sweete children.”\r\n\r\nAnd after all news travelled slowly. Those little love passages were\r\nalready six months old: “Tyme enough, I dare swere”—wrote the old\r\ndiplomatist, sitting alone in his study, with his Titian and his Bassanos\r\nlooking down upon him—“to refrigerat more love than was ever betweene\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE MANOR OF STALBRIDGE\r\n\r\n    “... He would very often steal away from all company, and spend\r\n    four or five hours alone in the fields, and think at random:\r\n    making his delighted imagination the busy scene where some\r\n    romance or other was daily acted.”—ROBERT BOYLE’S _Philaretus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the boys went to Eton, the Earl had very unpleasant things to\r\nthink about. Wentworth was pressing him hard. It is true that the little\r\ndinner-parties and card-parties and private theatricals at the Castle\r\nwere going on as if there were no Star Chamber behind them. In January\r\n1636 the Lord Deputy was inviting himself to supper at the Earl’s Dublin\r\nhouse, and bringing Lady Wentworth with him. Lady Dungarvan’s baby was\r\nborn in March, a “ffair daughter”, to be christened Frances, and to\r\nfigure in the old Earl’s diary as “lyttle ffranck”; and the Lord Deputy\r\nhimself stood sponsor, though he had just lost his own little son, and\r\nthe Dungarvan christening had been postponed till the Wentworth baby had\r\nbeen buried. But the Lord Deputy’s “sharp pursuit” of men was going on\r\nall the same. In February, before the death of Wentworth’s child and the\r\nDungarvan christening, Lord Mountmorris had been degraded from the office\r\nof Vice-Treasurer, “tried by a Commission and sentenced to be shot, for\r\nno other crime than a sneer” against Wentworth’s government.[50] The\r\nsentence was not to be carried out; but it became every day more evident\r\nthat “whatever man of whatever rank” opposed Wentworth, or even spoke\r\ndisrespectfully of his policy, “that man he pursued to punishment like a\r\nsleuth-hound”.[51]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of that year, the Earl of Cork had made his “Great\r\nConveighance,” by which he entailed all his lands upon his five sons.\r\nWentworth had taken exception to the conveyance of some of these lands to\r\nthe Earl’s eldest son, Lord Dungarvan; and in February a “sharp and large\r\ndiscourse” had taken place between the Lord Deputy and the Earl. In April\r\nthe Star Chamber Bill against the Earl, dealing with his titles to the\r\nchurchlands of Youghal, was still under discussion; and Wentworth was now\r\npressing for the payment of money, by way of ransom, which was at first\r\nto be £30,000, but was afterwards reduced to £15,000.\r\n\r\nThe Earl was still asserting his right to his lands, and unwilling to\r\ncompound—no-one had ever heard the Earl of Cork, he said, “enclyned to\r\noffer anything.” Things were at this pass when at the end of April Lady\r\nDungarvan, six weeks after her baby’s birth, fell sick; and the next day,\r\n“the smallpockes brake owt uppon her.” On that very day, under pressure\r\nfrom his friends and from his son Dungarvan, who went down on his knees\r\nbefore his father, the Earl of Cork gave way. Very unwillingly, on May\r\n2, he agreed to pay the £15,000 “for the King’s use,” and for his own\r\n“redemption out of Court”—though his “Innocencie and Intigritie” he\r\ndeclared, writing in his own private diary, were “as cleer as the son\r\nat high noon.” The old Royalist, even then, believed that if his King\r\nonly knew how undeservedly the mighty fine had him imposed, “he would not\r\naccept a penny of it.” The Earl was hard hit, though his great Conveyance\r\nwas at last signed and sealed, and he could talk of drinking a cup of\r\nsack “to wash away the care of a big debt.”[52] It is comforting to note\r\nthat he had meantime cash in hand not only to tip Archie Armstrong, the\r\nKing’s Jester, who seems to have passed through Dublin, but to pay for\r\ntwo knitted silk waistcoats for his own “somer wearings.”\r\n\r\nWhile all this was going on, Kynalmeaky and Broghill were enjoying\r\nwhat the Earl called their “peregrination.” A tutor had been found\r\nto accompany them on their foreign travels; a M. Marcombes, highly\r\nrecommended to the Earl by Sir Henry Wotton, as a man “borne for your\r\npurpose.” Sir Henry wrote from London, where he had been spending a\r\nweek or two, and was returning next day “to my poore Cell agayne at\r\nEton”;[53] but he gave the Earl a careful account of Marcombes, whom he\r\nhad seen in London. He was “by birthe French; native in the Province of\r\nAuvergne; bredd seaven years in Geneve, verie sounde in Religion, and\r\nwell conversant with Religious Men. Furnished with good literature and\r\nlanguages, espetially with Italian, which he speaketh as promptly as his\r\nowne. And wilbe a good guide for your Sonns in that delicat Piece of\r\nthe Worlde. He seemeth of himself neither of a lumpish nor of a light\r\ncomposition, but of a well-fixed meane.”\r\n\r\nM. Marcombes had already won golden opinions in the family of Lord\r\nMiddlesex, a former Lord Mayor of London; and was well known to the then\r\nLord Mayor, Mr. Burlamachy, who also wrote to the Earl about him. And Mr.\r\nPerkins, the tailor, seems to have put in a word; for there had been a\r\nmeeting in the “fumie citie” between Sir Henry Wotton and M. Marcombes\r\nand Mr. Perkins, at which Sir Henry had found the French tutor’s\r\nconversation “very apposite and sweet.”\r\n\r\nSo in the early spring of 1636 Kynalmeaky and Broghill, with their\r\ngovernor M. Marcombes, had set out from Dublin on their foreign travels,\r\nstopping long enough in London to kiss the King’s and Queen’s hands, and\r\nobtain the royal licence and passport to travel; and they took letters\r\nalso to Sir Henry Wotton at Eton, and to Frank and Robyn, and poor\r\nunmeriting Carew.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Cork himself, in the early stages of his struggle with\r\nWentworth, had thought of going to London, to “justify himself” once\r\nagain, as he had done when he was a young man, and Elizabeth was Queen.\r\nBut he was no longer a young man, and Charles I was not Queen Elizabeth,\r\nand the Lord Deputy, when he found it out, had objected strongly to the\r\nEarl’s little plan. On the contrary, the Lord Deputy had gone to England\r\nhimself, in the summer of 1636; and though Sir Henry Wotton was under “a\r\nkind of hovering conceypt” that the Earl of Cork was coming over, and\r\nthere was even a rumour that he was to be offered the Lord Chancellorship\r\nof England, the old Earl was to remain for two more years in Ireland. He\r\nwas busy as usual, moving about, on assize and other duties, between\r\nDublin and Lismore and Cork; paving the terrace at Lismore with hewn\r\nstones, dedicating the free schools and almshouses there, setting up an\r\nold servant in Dublin in a “tobacko” business, and paying Mr. Perkins’s\r\nbill for those little scarlet suits and cloth-of-silver doublets that\r\nFrank and Robyn were wearing in their Whitsuntide holidays. Sir Henry\r\nWotton was able to tell the Earl that Lady Lettice would see Frank in\r\nbetter health and strength than he had been in either kingdom before,\r\nwhile Robert would “entertayne her with his pretie conceptions, now a\r\ngreate deale more smoothely than he was wonte.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl had not given up his English project; on the contrary, it was\r\nto mature into the purchase of a little bit of England for his very own;\r\nand his choice had fallen on a “capitall howse, demesne, and lands” in\r\nDorsetshire. Accordingly in the autumn of 1636 he bought the Manor of\r\nStalbridge, and sent over a steward, Thomas Cross, to take possession. At\r\nStalbridge the Earl would be a near neighbour of the Earl of Bristol—his\r\nson-in-law Digby’s uncle—at Sherborne Castle.\r\n\r\nThe year 1636 had been a trying year; and one of the first expenses in\r\nthe New Year 1637 was a fee to Mr. Jacob Longe, of Kinsale, “my Jerman\r\nphysician,” for plaisters and prescriptions, “to stay the encrease of\r\nthe dead palsy which hath seized uppon all the right side of my boddy\r\n(God helpe me) £5.” And though the returns for the year shewed a “Lardge\r\nRevenew,” and the diary record for the year ended in a note of triumph,\r\nwith a triple “Amen, Amen, Amen,” there was yet sorrow in store that no\r\nrevenue, however large, could avert. For Peggie, the Earl’s youngest\r\ndaughter, was ill. The Earl had paid £5 to Mr. Higgins, the Lismore\r\ndoctor, to give her “phisick, which he never did”; and either because of\r\nthis, or in spite of this, Little Peggie did not get well. She died in\r\nJune 1637, in Lady Clayton’s house in Cork, where she and Mary had lived\r\nall this time together. The Lady Margaret Boyle, youngest daughter of the\r\nEarl of Cork—eight years old when she died—was buried in the family tomb\r\nat Youghal.\r\n\r\nIt was not till Midsummer 1638, when the last instalment of the mighty\r\nfine had been paid, that the Earl began his preparations for a prolonged\r\nvisit to England. He revoked all other wills, and again made a last will\r\nand testament; and at the end of July he actually set out for England,\r\ntaking with him his daughter Mary, Lord and Lady Barrymore, and several\r\nof the grandchildren.\r\n\r\nThe parting was a sad one between Mary Boyle and Lady Clayton, who had\r\njust lost her husband, and, a childless woman herself, had been a real\r\nmother to “Moll” and “Peggie.” But the Earl had a grand marriage in\r\nview for his daughter Mary; and he had yet to discover that Lady Mary\r\nhad a will of her own: that of all his daughters it was she who had\r\ninherited his own indomitable pride. Hitherto, she had been a child,\r\nbrought up away from him; to be gladdened from time to time by a happy\r\nvisit or a New Year’s gift. But even these are indications of the little\r\nlady’s tastes and character. It was to Mary the Earl gave the “ffether\r\nof diamonds and rubies that was my wive’s,” long before he could have\r\nknown how defiantly she would toss that little head of hers. She must\r\nhave been a fair horsewoman already at nine years old; for it was to\r\nher that the Earl sent the dead mother’s saddle and saddle-cloth of\r\ngreen velvet, laced and fringed with silver and green silk; and it is\r\ncertain she inherited the Earl’s love of fine dressing, from the choice\r\nof various small gowns of figured satins and rich stuffs of scarlet dye.\r\nOf even more significance is the old Earl’s gift of Sir Philip Sidney’s\r\n_Arcadia_, “To my daughter, Mary Boyle,” when this imperious young\r\ncreature was only twelve years old. Do little girls of twelve read Sir\r\nPhilip Sidney’s _Arcadia_ to-day? There was to come a moment when, if the\r\nEarl had ever read it himself, he must have heard in “Moll’s” voice, as\r\nshe answered him, some echo of Sidney’s teaching—\r\n\r\n            “... but a soule hath his life\r\n    Which is held in loue: loue it is hath ioynd\r\n                Life to this our Soule.”\r\n\r\nAfter the usual delays at starting, the _Ninth Whelp_ made a good\r\npassage; and the Earl and his party reached Bristol safely on Saturday\r\nAugust 4. As usual, presents were dispensed to the ship’s captain and\r\ncompany, together with what remained of a hogshead of claret wine. Next\r\nday, Sunday, the whole family went obediently to church; and on Monday\r\nmorning, leaving the others to follow with the servants and luggage, the\r\nold Earl, riding a borrowed horse, set off by himself to find his way to\r\nStalbridge.[54]\r\n\r\nA wonderful peace and stillness falls on the Dorsetshire uplands at\r\nevening after a long, hot summer day. Up hill and down dale and up hill\r\nagain go the Dorsetshire lanes, between their tangled hedges, through a\r\ncountry of undulating woods and downs and soft green pastures. The lark\r\nsings, high up, invisible: a far-away, sleepy cock-crow or faint bark of\r\nsheepdog breaks the silence; the grazing cattle bend their brown heads in\r\nthe fields.\r\n\r\nThe Earl was in England again, the land of his birth. It was perhaps not\r\naltogether a prosperous and satisfied England, in August 1638. The heavy\r\nhand of taxation was on even these pastoral uplands. The heart of England\r\nwas throbbing with political unrest. But on that evening, at least,\r\nthere could have been only the lark’s ecstasy, and the sweet smell of\r\nwild thyme and woodsmoke in the air. Ireland, the distressful country of\r\nhis adoption, lay behind the old man, and with it the memories of fifty\r\nstrenuous years;—all that was hardest and proudest and tenderest in a\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\nLord and Lady Dungarvan were already at Stalbridge with “lyttle\r\nffrancke.” There was another baby-daughter now, but it had apparently\r\nbeen left at Salisbury House, in London. Dungarvan had ridden some six\r\nmiles upon the road to meet his father. It was still daylight when,\r\nriding together—the old man must have been pretty stiff in the saddle,\r\nfor he had ridden nearly sixty miles that day—they came in sight of the\r\nElizabethan manor standing among elms and chestnut trees, surrounded by\r\npark lands and hayfields and orchards: “My owne house of Stalbridge in\r\nDorcetshier; this being the firste tyme that ever I sawe the place.”[55]\r\n\r\nAfter this, the movements of the Earl and his family read rather like a\r\nCourt Circular. Not much is heard of the life that must have been going\r\non in the little town itself, with its Church and market Cross; but the\r\nmere presence of this great Irish family among them must, by the laws of\r\nsupply and demand, have wrought many changes in the little market town.\r\nThe Earl paid his love and service to his neighbour and kinsman, the Earl\r\nof Bristol, at Sherborne Castle, and the Earl and Countess of Bristol,\r\nwith all their house-party, immediately returned the visit; after which\r\nthe whole family at the Manor were “feasted” for two days at Sherborne\r\nCastle. The Earl of Cork and his house-party rode to “the Bathe”, and\r\nreturn visits were received at Stalbridge from friends at “the Bathe”.\r\nAnd a week or two later the Earl, attended by Dungarvan and Barrymore,\r\nrode to London, and was graciously received by the King and “all the\r\nLords at Whitehall.” The King praised the Earl’s government of Ireland,\r\nand the Archbishop of Canterbury was particularly friendly.\r\n\r\nLady Barrymore and Lady Dungarvan had between them undertaken to ease\r\nthe Earl from the “trowble of hows-keeping,” and for this purpose were\r\nallowed £50 a week, and more when they wanted it; and the cellars and\r\nlarders at Stalbridge were replenished from time to time with gifts. A\r\nton of claret wine and six gallons of aqua vitæ arrived as a New Year’s\r\ngift from Munster, and “veary fatt does” from English friends; while\r\namong his assets the Earl counted, besides the produce of his Stalbridge\r\nlands and woods, the twenty stalled oxen, the powdered beef, the bacon\r\nand salted salmon that were sent from his Irish estates.\r\n\r\nThomas Cross, his steward, became “seneschal”;—perhaps there was a\r\nseneschal at Sherborne Castle; and there was a Clerk of the Kitchen and\r\na large staff of household servants, men and women, and a long list of\r\nrules for the management of the household drawn up and signed by the Earl\r\nhimself.[56] And of course the “re-edification” of the Manor House began\r\nat once. There was water to be carried in leaden pipes; new furniture\r\nto hasten home from the London upholsterer, who dwelt at the sign of\r\nthe Grasshopper; a red embroidered bed, a tawny velvet carpet, couch\r\nand chairs. There was a new coach to buy, and the paths and terraces at\r\nStalbridge were to be stone paved exactly like the paths and terraces\r\nat Sherborne Castle. Stairs with a stone balustrade, and carved stone\r\nchimney-pieces were to be added to the Manor;—one at least carved with\r\nthe Earl’s coat of arms “compleate,” and reaching nearly to the ceiling,\r\n“fair and graceful in all respects.” There was a limekiln to build, and\r\npit coal to procure and cane apples[57] to be planted in the orchard.\r\nBut charity only began at home; and in this case it did not prevent\r\na subscription being sent—“a myte” of £100—to help the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury in his scheme of “re-edifying Pawle’s Church in London.”\r\n\r\nMeantime, all the Earl’s daughters and sons-in-law, except Dorothy and\r\nArthur Loftus, who remained in Ireland, seem to have found their way,\r\nseparately or together, to the Manor of Stalbridge; while grandchildren,\r\nnieces and nephews and even “cozens” were welcomed under its roof. The\r\nDungarvans made their headquarters there, and the Barrymores, and the\r\nlittle Lady Mary, who was now fourteen, and to be considered a grown-up\r\nyoung lady, with an allowance of £100 a year “to fynde herself.” And\r\nthey were presently joined by the Kildares, and Katharine and Arthur\r\nJones. Even the plaintive Lettice and her lord stayed for some time\r\nunder the Earl’s roof.[58] And in March 1639, after an absence of three\r\nyears, Kynalmeaky and Broghill, with M. Marcombes, returned from their\r\n“peregrination”. They found Frank and Robyn already at Stalbridge, though\r\nnot in the great house itself. For their father had taken the boys away\r\nfrom Eton on his return journey from London in November 1638, and since\r\nthen they had been boarded out with the Rev. Mr. Dowch at the Parsonage,\r\nscarcely “above twice a musket-shot” distant from their father’s house.\r\nTheir three years at Eton had cost, “for diett, tutaradge and aparell,”\r\nexactly £914 3_s._ 9_d._\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl of Cork visited Eton and took his two boys away, Sir Henry\r\nWotton must have been already ill. Since his return after the summer\r\nbreaking-time of 1638 the old Provost had suffered from a feverish\r\ndistemper, which was to prove the beginning of the end.[59]\r\n\r\nIt is possible that during the Provost’s illness extra duties had fallen\r\non Mr. Harrison, the Rector; in any case the two boys had been removed\r\nfrom the care of their “old courteous schoolmaster,” and handed over to\r\n“a new, rigid fellow;” and things were not going quite so happily for\r\nthem at Eton as heretofore. Moreover, poor Carew, the romance of the\r\nunderbaker’s daughter nipped in the bud, had, from overmuch fondness for\r\ncards and dice, come utterly to grief.\r\n\r\nIt was during this last year of Robert Boyle’s schooldays—in the April of\r\n1638, before Sir Henry Wotton’s illness, and while all was going on as\r\nusual at Eton—that Mr. Provost had entertained at his hospitable table\r\na guest whose life was to be strangely linked in after years with that\r\nof some members of the great Boyle family. This was John Milton, then a\r\nyoung poet, living with his father at Horton—not far from Eton—and just\r\nabout to set out on his Italian journey.[60] Was Robert Boyle one of the\r\n“hopeful youths” selected by the Provost to dine at his table that day\r\nwhen Milton dined there? And did Robert Boyle listen to the talk that\r\nwent on at table between Milton and his friend, the learned Hales, and\r\nSir Henry Wotton? It was very pleasant talk. When Milton returned to\r\nHorton he ventured to send the Provost a little letter of thanks and a\r\ncopy of his _Comus_ as a parting gift; and Sir Henry sent his own footboy\r\npost-haste to Horton, to catch Milton before he started, with a pretty\r\nletter of acknowledgment and an introduction to the British Agent in\r\nVenice. It is noteworthy that the advice Sir Henry Wotton gave to Milton,\r\nand the advice he always gave to his own pupils when they were setting\r\nout on a career of diplomacy abroad, showed that, while the old man had\r\nnot forgotten his experience of the Augsburg album, his kindly cynicism\r\nremained unchanged. _I pensiori stretti_, was the advice he handed on in\r\nhis charming letter to Milton,—_ed il viso sciolto_; while to all young\r\nEtonians travelling in diplomacy he used to say, _Always tell the truth;\r\nfor you will never be believed_.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say how much Robert Boyle may have owed to the guidance and\r\ntalk of Sir Henry Wotton. Boyle remembered him as a fine gentleman who\r\npossessed the art of making others so; and it was John Harrison’s methods\r\nof teaching that had impressed the boy. Yet it must not be forgotten that\r\nthe Provost’s tastes were not only literary and scholarly; that he had\r\nnot only surrounded himself with a library of books that Robert Boyle in\r\nhis boyhood must have envied—Sir Henry Wotton was of a scientific turn\r\nof mind: he was fond of experimenting. Ever since the days when he had\r\nwatched Kepler at work in his laboratory and supplied his cousin Lord\r\nBacon with facts, he had been accustomed to occupy himself, in more or\r\nless dilletante fashion, with such little experiments as the distilling\r\nof medicinal herbs and the measurement of time by allowing water to pass\r\nthrough a filter, drop by drop; and it was Sir Henry Wotton whom Izaak\r\nWalton consulted about the preparation of “seductive-smelling oils” in\r\nthe catching of little fishes. And who could it have been, in that last\r\nyear that Robyn spent at Eton, who lent him the books that “meeting in\r\nhim with a restless fancy” gave his thoughts such a “latitude of roving”?\r\nRobyn had been away from school on a visit to London, and there had\r\nfallen ill of a “tertian ague”, and had been sent back to Eton to see if\r\ngood air and diet might not do more for him than all “the Queen’s and\r\nother doctors’ remedies” had done. His own phrase[61] is that “to divert\r\nhis melancholy they made him read the State Adventures of Amadis de\r\nGaule, and other fabulous and wandering stories.” Who was the “they” at\r\nEton? It could not have been the “new, rigid fellow”. Amadis de Gaule may\r\nhave been part of Mr. John Harrison’s system of education, but one would\r\nlike to believe that Sir Henry Wotton had some hand in fashioning Robert\r\nBoyle—that his whole library was open to the boy, not only the books of\r\nromance and adventure in it that gave Robyn’s thoughts such a “latitude\r\nof roving.” One would like to believe that the torch was indeed passed on\r\nfrom Kepler’s laboratory, and by the study of one of those three copies\r\nof Bacon’s _Novum Organum_, into the hands of England’s first great\r\nexperimental chemist.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, Sir Henry Wotton was already ill when Frank and Robyn\r\nwere removed from Eton in November 1638; and it was Mr. Harrison who duly\r\nsent after them to Stalbridge the furniture of their chamber—the blew\r\nperpetuana curtains and all the other things so carefully inventoried by\r\npoor Carew. And Carew himself no longer served his sweet young masters:\r\nhe had been succeeded by a manservant with the suggestive name of Rydowt,\r\nwho appears to have been a married man, and was accommodated with a\r\nlittle cottage of his own at Stalbridge, with a garden which the Earl\r\nplanted with “cane apples” from Ireland. The boys were to live and learn\r\ntheir lessons with Mr. Dowch at the Parsonage; and that “old divine”\r\nwas very soon to discover that Robyn had not learnt much Latin at Eton\r\nafter all, and “with great care and civility” to proceed to read with\r\nhim the Latin poets as well as the Latin prose-writers. And while the\r\nEarl gave Frank a horse of his own, and knew him to be happy and gallant\r\nin the saddle, it was Robyn who was the old Earl’s Benjamin, most loved\r\nof all his sons. The family saw a likeness in Robyn to his father—a\r\nlikeness both in body and mind. It is difficult to credit the Earl of\r\nCork with any of his youngest son’s habit of “unemployed pensiviness,”\r\nbut there must have been something in Robyn when he was quite a little\r\nfellow—a quiet self-reliance—that impressed the old Earl strangely. Robyn\r\nwas only twelve years old; he had as yet shown none of the traits of\r\ncharacter that the Earl so “severely disrelished” in some of his sons\r\nand sons-in-law. And so, when he gave Frank the horse, the Earl listened\r\nperhaps with some wonderment to Robyn’s “pretie conceptions” in excellent\r\nlanguage, spoken still not quite smoothly; and he was content to let the\r\nboy wander as he liked. He gave his Benjamin the keys of his orchard, not\r\nafraid to leave him in a very paradise of unplucked apples, “thinking at\r\nrandom.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF THE SAVOY\r\n\r\n    “You shall have all this winter att the Savoy, in Sʳ. Tho.\r\n    Stafford’s howse, the greatest familie that will be in London\r\n    (I pray God the ould man houlds out).”—Letter from Sir John\r\n    Leeke to Sir Edmund Verney, 1639: _Verney Memoirs_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Earl’s gift of a horse to his son Frank had been made at a\r\npsychological moment. For Frank, at sixteen, was not over robust, and\r\nRobyn, not much more than twelve, was scarcely fitted to defend his\r\nKing and Country; and they must have just watched their three elder\r\nbrothers, Dungarvan, Kynalmeaky and Broghill, ride off in great spirits\r\nfrom Stalbridge to join the King at Newcastle or York. War was in the\r\nair, and rumours of war; and Stalbridge Manor and Sherborne Castle, and\r\nthe villages of Dorsetshire and all the great families in England, were\r\nastir, as day by day and week by week the troops of English horse and\r\nfoot were moving northwards to engage against what the old Earl turned\r\noff so lightly in his diary as the “Covenanting, rebelleows Skots.”\r\n\r\nIn January 1639 a circular letter had been sent out in King Charles’\r\nname to all the English nobility, asking them to state how far and in\r\nwhat manner they were ready to assist the Scottish Expedition; and week\r\nby week, according to their means and their political inclinations, the\r\nEnglish nobles—Laudians and Puritans alike—had been sending in their\r\nanswers: £1000, and twenty horse; twenty horse and attendance in person\r\nor by substitute; £1000 in lieu of horse; £500 and twelve horse; and\r\nso on.[62] And some gave willingly, and some gave grudgingly, and some\r\nevaded promising to give anything; and one or two were brave enough to\r\nrefuse—and to give their reasons why. Even at Court there was “much\r\ncontrarity”; it was a case of “soe many men soe many opinions.”[63]\r\nWentworth, over in Ireland, had written offering his King £2000, and if\r\nnecessary more to his “uttermost farthing”. And the Earl of Cork, at\r\nStalbridge, had not done badly either, though he seems to have had his\r\nreservations about this levying of money and troops. His neighbour, the\r\nEarl of Bristol, at Sherborne, was one of those who had evaded promising\r\nanything in the meantime.\r\n\r\nBut in February and March Dungarvan and Barrymore had been in London,\r\nand just at this time also Kynalmeaky and Broghill had arrived back in\r\nLondon with M. Marcombes. During this visit to London Dungarvan had been\r\nled into an undertaking to serve his King in the Scottish Expedition: a\r\nrash undertaking, made without his father’s “privitie”; “an unadvised\r\nengagement” is the Earl’s comment in his diary. But all the same the\r\nEarl supplied his son and heir with £3000 to raise and arm a troop of a\r\nhundred horse—a magnificent subscription, which at the time caused much\r\ntalk at the Court of Whitehall. Lord Barrymore, at the same time, had\r\nbeen commissioned by the King to hurry across to Ireland with letters to\r\nWentworth, and to “raise and press” a thousand Irishmen, foot-soldiers,\r\ninto the King’s service against the Scots.\r\n\r\nThe very day that Barrymore set out for Ireland on this mission the Earl\r\nof Bristol left Sherborne for the rendezvous at York. A day or two later\r\nKing Charles himself set out from London on his journey northwards, and\r\nin April, Kynalmeaky and Broghill were being fitted out with arms and\r\nsaddles and “armors of prooff”, in order to accompany their brother\r\nDungarvan. In the beginning of May, Dungarvan’s wagons and carriages\r\nbegan their journey from Stalbridge; and on May 9 the Earl’s three\r\nsons, Dungarvan, Kynalmeaky, and Broghill, rode out of Stalbridge with\r\nDungarvan’s troop of one hundred horse. Three of his five sons! “God, I\r\nbeseech him,” wrote the Earl in his diary, “restore them safe, happy, and\r\nvictorious, to my comfort.” It was then that he gave Frank a horse for\r\nhis very own, and that the small philosopher was allowed to pocket the\r\norchard keys. And the family at the Manor settled down to wait for news\r\nof their soldiers—so slow of coming in those old days. The ladies and the\r\nchildren were left behind in the care of the old Earl, M. Marcombes, and\r\nMr. Dowch, the parson.\r\n\r\nThere were a good many ladies at the Manor during the summer of 1639. A\r\nbevy of daughters had gathered about the old Earl, and were “exceeding\r\nwelcome unto” him. And it is not to be supposed that it was by any\r\nmeans a doleful household while the men of the family were away. For\r\nthe women of the Boyle family, whatever their education had or had not\r\nbeen, were every whit as clever by nature as the men: “Believe it,”\r\nwrote the family friend, Sir John Leeke, to Sir Edmund Verney, about\r\nthe ladies of the Boyle family, “Ould Corke could not begett nothing\r\nfoolish.” Lady Dungarvan, his daughter-in-law, and his daughters Lady\r\nBarrymore, Lady Lettice Goring, Lady Katharine Jones and the little Lady\r\nMary Boyle, were all at Stalbridge at this time, together with several\r\nof the grandchildren and all the “retinues.” And in picturing this\r\nfamily gathering it is strange to remember that at least three of these\r\nnoble women must have been marked by the scourge of the smallpox. Lady\r\nDungarvan had never been beautiful; and her recent attack of smallpox,\r\nhowever it may have altered her pleasant face, had not left her any less\r\ncheerful and good-natured than when she first came a bride amongst them,\r\nand won, by her charming person and manner, the liking of the “best sort\r\nof people” in Ireland. It was a charm that was to outlive her youth: “A\r\nvery fine-speaking lady,” wrote Samuel Pepys of her many years later;\r\n“and a good woman, but old, and not handsome; but a brave woman.” And so\r\novercome was Mr. Pepys by his first sight and salutation of this noble\r\nlady at Burlington House that he managed to set his periwig afire in the\r\ncandle that was brought for the sealing of a letter.[64]\r\n\r\nLady Barrymore had also suffered severely from smallpox soon after her\r\nchild-marriage, and at the same time with her sister Lettice. This\r\nillness, and the subsequent disappointments of life, had left Lettice\r\nGoring a querulous invalid. She was shockingly illiterate, and she was\r\nsmall-minded, though she was not a stupid woman. But Lady Barrymore seems\r\nto have kept all her charms—not the least of them her “brave hart”. She\r\nwas clever, very political and chatty; “very energetic and capable, very\r\namusing and very lovable.”[65] And then there was Lady Katharine—wife\r\nof Arthur Jones;—the one of all the Earl’s daughters with the finest\r\nintellect, the finest character, and, according to report, the most\r\nbeautiful face. Weighed down as she was by a miserable marriage, she\r\nwas to rise above all the trials of life, to be remembered by later\r\ngenerations as “Milton’s Friend,” the “Incomparable Lady Ranelagh”, the\r\n“dearest, dearest, dearest sister” of Robert Boyle. “A more brave wench\r\nor a Braver Spiritt you have not often mett withall,” Sir John Leeke\r\nwrote of her in the summer of 1639; “she hath a memory that will hear a\r\nsermon and goe home and penn itt after dinner verbatim. I know not how\r\nshe will appeare in England, but she is most accounted of at Dublin.”\r\n\r\nSir John Leeke, who had married Sir Edmund Verney’s half-sister, was\r\nrelated also to the Barrymore family, and lived with his wife and\r\nchildren in a house on the Castle Lyons estates. It was Lady Barrymore\r\nwho figured in his delightful letters as “My deare Mustris”, and “the\r\nworthiest of woemen”. But it was Katharine Jones, and the sorrow that\r\nlooked out of her sweet face, that had won all his chivalrous devotion.\r\n“My pretious Katharine”, he wrote, “is somewhat decayed from the sweetest\r\nface I ever saw (and surely I have seen good ones).”\r\n\r\nThe little Katy—who might have married young Sapcott Beaumont, and so\r\nbecome one of a family known afterwards for its generous patronage of\r\nart and literature, the family so kind to the Poet Wordsworth—had been\r\ngiven, at fifteen, to “honest Arthur Jones”, who would some day be\r\nViscount Ranelagh. Her marriage portion had been duly paid down, as per\r\nagreement, at Strongbow’s tomb in Christchurch, Dublin, on Midsummer\r\nDay 1631. She had been carried off to Athlone Castle; and though she\r\nhad since lived a good deal under her father’s roof, and had evidently\r\nalways been a special object of her own family’s care and affection, she\r\nhad, none the less, ever since her marriage-day, been in legal bondage\r\nto a man who was a gambler and a churl. In this summer of 1639, the old\r\nEarl, writing to Lord Ranelagh, the father of Arthur Jones, was begging\r\nhim rather pathetically not to insist on his son’s return to Ireland,\r\nbut to allow Katharine and Arthur to spend the winter together in the\r\nHouse of the Savoy: “They shalbe both lodged and dyeted in my house\r\nand hartily welcome.” He seems to have hoped that a winter in London\r\nmight improve Arthur Jones, “now that he hath given over immoderate\r\nplay in Corners.”[66] But if the Earl was determined, for his favourite\r\ndaughter’s sake, to make the best of a miserable business, Sir John Leeke\r\nin his letter to Sir Edmund Verney was more outspoken. “She is keapte and\r\nlong hath bine by the foulest churl in the worlde,” he wrote: “he hath\r\nonly one virtue that he seldome cometh sober to bedd....”[67]\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely to be wondered at if the youngest of this bevy of\r\nsisters, the little Lady Mary Boyle, looked dubiously on the thing\r\ncalled Husband, as she saw it in one or two types of brother-in-law that\r\npresented themselves to her girlish scrutiny. With her own horses, her\r\nown handsome allowance, and a great deal of her own way, this little\r\nlady of fourteen was not disposed to “change her condition.” The stormy\r\nromance of her life was to come all too soon; but in the meantime the\r\nBeauty was still sleeping. In three of her sisters’ marriages, she could\r\nhave seen little of that “Heart Exchange” of which we may imagine her\r\nto have been reading in her volume of Sir Philip Sidney’s _Arcadia_—an\r\nopinionative little lady, probably in a scarlet gown, on some sequestered\r\nseat in the manor garden.\r\n\r\n    “My true-love has my heart, and I have his,\r\n    By just exchange one for the other given.”\r\n\r\nNot of George Goring, handsome, plausible, dissolute and cold; nor of\r\nKildare, who deserted wife and children and pawned the family silver; nor\r\nof Arthur Jones, who played immoderately in corners, and habitually went\r\ntipsy to bed, could it ever have been said by any woman, however wifely\r\nand compliant—\r\n\r\n    “His heart in me keeps me and him in one,\r\n    My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides.”\r\n\r\nNo: Mary Boyle, at fourteen, was not disposed to change her condition;\r\nand so it was with a ready-made aversion to matrimony that, in the\r\nsummer of 1639, she received Mr. James Hamilton,[68] son and heir of\r\nLord Clandeboye, who arrived by paternal invitation at the Manor of\r\nStalbridge. The Earl of Cork and Lord Clandeboye had been for some\r\ntime in correspondence about this alliance; and Mr. James Hamilton,\r\nimmediately on his return from his foreign travels, which had included “a\r\ngeneral survey” of Italy and France, had sent his own man to Stalbridge\r\nwith letters heralding his arrival, and had followed a day or two later,\r\ntravelling in some state, with his tutor and other attendants. There\r\nseems to have been no fault to find with the young man. According to Lord\r\nClandeboye, his son was “a hater of vice, and a Lover of Noble partes,\r\nand of vertuous industries”; but all the same Mary Boyle expressed, in no\r\nmeasured terms, “a very high averseness and contradicon” to her father’s\r\ncommands. She would have nothing to say to this suitor for her little\r\nfourteen-year-old hand; and with much chagrin the Earl was obliged to\r\nwrite in his diary, “being refused in marriadge by my unrewly daughter\r\nMary, he departed my hows the second of September to the Bathe.”\r\n\r\nBut between May and September many things of importance had happened\r\nat the Manor of Stalbridge. The Scottish engagement had come quickly\r\nto an end. It was May 9 when Dungarvan and his two brothers had left\r\nStalbridge; and from time to time letters had been coming to the old\r\nEarl from his sons in camp near Berwick. But on Midsummer Day, about two\r\no’clock in the morning, Broghill had clattered into the courtyard of the\r\nManor, having ridden post-haste from the camp to bring his father the\r\nfirst happy news of the “Honourable Peace” concluded with the Scots. It\r\nwas, of course, but a “seeming settlement,” and of short duration: the\r\nbeginning, indeed, and not the end of civil war. But Dungarvan’s troop\r\nof horse was disbanded, and, according to the Earl’s diary, the English\r\narmy was dissolved before poor Barrymore landed out of Ireland with his\r\n“yrish regiment of 1000 foot.” In July, George Goring joined his Lady\r\nat the Manor, and they left together for “the Bathe”. Dungarvan and his\r\nbrothers were back at Stalbridge, and the King and Queen were in London\r\nagain. And early in August, Sir Thomas and Lady Stafford arrived on a\r\nvisit to the Earl of Cork; and the diary records “my Lady Stafford and\r\nI conferred privately between ourselves towching our children, _and\r\nconcluded_.”\r\n\r\nThis private conference in the Stalbridge parlour decided the fate of the\r\nsweet-spirited Frank. My Lady Stafford, when she married the Earl’s “trew\r\nfriend,” Sir Thomas Stafford, gentleman usher to the Queen,[69] was the\r\nwidow of Sir Robert Killigrew of Hanworth in Middlesex, and the mother of\r\nseveral Killigrew children. One of them was the notorious Tom Killigrew,\r\npage of honour to Charles I, court wit, playwright, and boon-companion\r\nof Charles II; and another was the little Mistress Elizabeth Killigrew,\r\n“both young and handsome,”[70] and at this time one of the Queen’s maids\r\nof honour. And now Francis Boyle was to marry Elizabeth Killigrew.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be said that the old Earl, in the Stalbridge parlour\r\nconference, “held it fitter” that a contract, rather than a marriage,\r\nshould be arranged; and that it was the King himself who intervened,\r\napproving of the plan of foreign travel, but adding: “We conceave that a\r\ncompleate and perfect marriage wilbe most convenient & honorable for all\r\nparties.”[71]\r\n\r\nIt was precisely at this juncture that Mr. James Hamilton arrived upon\r\nthe scene; and it was just two days later, as the family coaches were in\r\nreadiness to drive the whole house-party to Sherborne Castle, to “kill\r\na Buck” and dine with the Earl and Countess of Bristol, that Katharine\r\nJones’s third baby made its premature appearance in the family circle.\r\n“But my daughter shall never be one of his Majestye’s Auditors,” said the\r\ngood-natured old Earl, “since she can keepe her reckoninge noe better.”\r\nAnd he recalled how her sister Digby had served him the same way during\r\nthat long-ago visit to Oxford.\r\n\r\nIt must have been a trying time at the Manor, with match-making, and\r\nbuck-killing, and babies, and “re-edifications” all mixed up together\r\nin most admired disorder. But everybody behaved beautifully in the\r\ncircumstances. Lady Stafford stood sponsor at the baby’s hurried\r\nchristening, and afterwards presented the Earl of Cork with a “lyttle\r\nglass bottle of Spiritt of Amber for curing the palsy”; which looks as\r\nif Frank’s marriage-negotiations, and the baby’s birth, and the unruly\r\nMary’s “averseness and contradicon” had altogether been a little too much\r\nfor the old man.\r\n\r\nBy September, however, the guests were all gone, and the Earl was\r\nreceiving letters from the King and Queen, expressing their “several\r\nwishes” for the marriage of Frank and the little maid of honour. And\r\naccordingly on September 19, Frank and Robert, under the charge of\r\nM. Marcombes, and with forty shillings each for pocket-money, were\r\ndispatched to London, on a visit to Sir Thomas and Lady Stafford. Frank,\r\nGod bless him! was at sixteen to “make his addresses to the Lady,” while\r\nRobert Boyle, in his thirteenth year, looked on and philosophised.[72]\r\n\r\nThe old Earl had given Frank a letter, to be delivered into Lady\r\nStafford’s hands—\r\n\r\n“I do now send this bearer to offer his service unto you, and to be\r\ncommanded and governed by you.”\r\n\r\nIt is a touching letter. The old man was obeying his King’s commands, but\r\nhe was full of fatherly anxiety; proud, fond and dubious. He intended\r\nto spare neither care nor charge in giving Frank a noble breeding in\r\nforeign kingdoms; he would have preferred a contract; the boy’s extreme\r\nyouth, his further education, the difficulty of sending him back after\r\nhis marriage “to be governed by a tutor”, were all in the old man’s mind\r\nas he wrote; and he begged the prospective mother-in-law also to take\r\nthem into consideration: “ffor I send him unto you as a silken Thrid to\r\nbe wrought into what samples you please either flower or weed, and to be\r\nknotted or untyed as god shalbe pleased to put into your noble hart. Yet,\r\nin my best understanding, a good and sure contract is as bynding as a\r\nmarriage, espetially when all intenc̃ons are reall, as myne are, and ever\r\nshalbe; which are accompanied with a strong assurance that this childe\r\nof myne will prove religious, honest, and just, though he be modest and\r\nsomewhat over bashfull.... What he is, is with himself and yours....”\r\n\r\nEarly in October, the Manor of Stalbridge was dismantled, and the Earl\r\nof Cork, with the rest of his family and retinue, set out in state for\r\nLondon. Sir Thomas Stafford had arranged to lend his old friend his House\r\nof the Savoy for the winter, “bravely furnished in all things except\r\nlinen and plate,” which were being brought from Stalbridge.\r\n\r\nLady Barrymore and Lady Katharine Jones “with their Lords and Children”\r\nwere to be lodged in the adjacent houses, but were to take their\r\nmeals with the Earl their father in the Savoy;[73] and, as the Lady\r\nMary expressed it many years later, “when we were once settled there,\r\nmy father, living extraordinarily high, drew a very great resort\r\nthither.”[74]\r\n\r\nNow that Kynalmeaky and Broghill were out of leading strings, their\r\n“Governour” was transferred to the two younger boys; and it was arranged\r\nthat as soon as Frank and Mrs. Betty Killigrew were united in the bonds\r\nof matrimony, M. Marcombes was to carry both the boys off on their\r\n“peregrination”. Sir Henry Wotton had hinted at some such scheme when he\r\ntold the Earl that Marcombes was “borne for your purpose”; and indeed M.\r\nMarcombes—the guide and teacher of Robert Boyle from his thirteenth to\r\nhis eighteenth year—was a remarkable man. “He was a man”—wrote Robert\r\nBoyle in later years—“whose garb, his mien and outside, had very much\r\nof his nation, having been divers years a traveller and a soldier. He\r\nwas well-fashioned, and very well knew what belonged to a gentleman....\r\nScholarship he wanted not, having in his greener years been a professed\r\nstudent in Divinity; but he was much less read in books than men, and\r\nhated pedantry as much as any of the seven deadly sins.”\r\n\r\nBefore company, the governor was “always very civil to his pupils, apt\r\nto eclipse their failings, and set off their good qualities to the best\r\nadvantage;” but in his private conversation he was cynically disposed,\r\nand “a very nice critic both of words and men.” His worst quality\r\nseems to have been his “choler”; and Robyn soon learned that to avoid\r\n“clashing” with his governor he must manage to keep his own quick young\r\ntemper in submission.\r\n\r\nThis was the man with whom, all the summer of 1639, Robert Boyle had\r\nread the _Universal History_ in Latin, and carried on “a familiar kind\r\nof conversation” in French. And this was the man in whose charge Frank\r\nand Robyn were to set off on their travels when Frank’s wedding was\r\nover. They were to go to Geneva, where Broghill and Kynalmeaky had\r\nbeen before them, where there was now a Madame Marcombes in readiness\r\nto receive them.[75] For during his previous peregrinations in France\r\nand Switzerland with Kynalmeaky and Broghill, Marcombes, quite unknown\r\nto the Earl, had met and married his wife. She was a Parisian lady, of\r\ngood civic connexions, and she was an excellent housewife. Marcombes had\r\nactually run away from Kynalmeaky and Broghill for a day or two to tie\r\nthe nuptial knot. The Earl had at first been angry, but had forgiven\r\nMarcombes; indeed the charge of Kynalmeaky and Broghill was not an easy\r\none; perhaps the Earl realised that Marcombes, under the circumstances,\r\nrequired a _besseres Ich_; and, in any case, Marcombes would have been\r\ndifficult to replace. For he was—he says it himself—“an honest and\r\nCarefull man”; and he told the Earl in plain words while he was acting as\r\ngovernor to Kynalmeaky and Broghill that the title of governor was but “a\r\nvaine name, specially when those yt a man has under his Charge have kept\r\nso long Companie with hunters and players, and soe many Gentlemen that\r\nwill humour them in anything and will let them know their Greatnesse, as\r\nmy young Lords have been used in Ireland.”[76]\r\n\r\nMarcombes had found no fault with my Lord Broghill: “I may assure your\r\nLordship yt you shall have both honour and comfort in him.... Every\r\none yt knows him Loves him and speakes well of him and without any\r\ncompliment”; but Kynalmeaky, the brilliant young libertine, though “a\r\nyoung Lord of many good parts,” loved his pleasures too well. “I looke\r\nat home very narrowly to his drinking and abroad to his borrowing”,\r\nMarcombes had reported to the Earl. Moreover, both the boys had had\r\nsmallpox in Genoa; but he had brought them both safely back to Stalbridge\r\nin time to join their brother Dungarvan’s troop of horse in the Scottish\r\nengagement; and it must have been with a sigh of relief that he turned\r\nhis attention to the two younger boys, Frank and Robyn.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of October, Francis Boyle was married to Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nKilligrew, in the King’s Chapel of Whitehall. The King gave the lady away\r\nwith his own hand, and a royal feast in Court was made for the young\r\ncouple. The King and Queen were both present; and the old Earl and three\r\nof his daughters (probably Lady Barrymore, Lady Katharine Jones, and Lady\r\nMary Boyle) sat at the royal table, “amongst all the great Lords and\r\nLadies.” The King himself “took the bride out to dance....”\r\n\r\nAnd four days later, “to render this joy as short as it was great,”[77]\r\nFrank was packed off to France with Robyn and M. Marcombes. Having kissed\r\ntheir Majesties’ hands, the boys took a “differing farewell of all their\r\nfriends.” The bridegroom was “exceedingly afflicted” to have to leave his\r\nlittle new-made wife; but the spiritay Robyn was on tip-toe of excitement\r\nat the thought of foreign travel and adventure. On October 28, 1639,\r\nthey set out with their governor and two French servants from the House\r\nof the Savoy. So far the sweet-spirited Frank had done everything that\r\nwas expected of him; but there was a scene at parting. For the bride was\r\nto be left behind in the Savoy under the Earl of Cork’s care, with the\r\nunruly Lady Mary as her “chamber-fellow.” And so unwilling was Frank to\r\ntear himself away that the old Earl was incensed; and Frank, in those\r\nlast troubled moments of leave-taking, forgot to buckle on his sword—the\r\nsword, as well as the lady, was left behind!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nROBYN GOES ABROAD\r\n\r\n    O ye windes of God, blesse ye the Lord: praise him and magnifie\r\n    him for ever.\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    O ye fire and heat, blesse ye the Lord: praise him and magnifie\r\n    him for ever.\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    O ye ice and snow, blesse ye the Lord: praise him and magnifie\r\n    him for ever.\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    O ye lightnings and clouds, blesse ye the Lord: praise him and\r\n    magnifie him for ever.\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    O ye Children of men, blesse ye the Lord: praise him and\r\n    magnifie him for ever.\r\n\r\n              _Benedicite omnia opera: Black Letter Prayer Book of 1636._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little party—five in all—Francis and Robert, and M. Marcombes, with\r\ntheir two French servants, “took post for Rye in Sussex; and there,\r\nthough the sea was rather rough, they hired a ship,” and “a prosperous\r\npuff of wind did safely, by next morning, blow them into France.”[78]\r\nThey were a day and night at sea, and “a little tossed att night”; they\r\nhad escaped the perils of the deep and of “yᵉ Donkirks”; and after\r\nstopping for a short refreshment at Dieppe, they set off towards Rouen\r\nand Paris.[79] They enjoyed the company of several French gentlemen on\r\nthe road, of which they were glad; for a robbery had been “freshly\r\ncommitted in a wood” between Rouen and Paris, through which the\r\ntravellers would be obliged to pass by night. Marcombes sensibly observed\r\nthat the very next day after the robbery would be the very safest time to\r\nride through the wood; and accordingly they continued their journey. At\r\nRouen, Robyn was fascinated by the great floating bridge, which rose and\r\nfell with the tide water; and in one of his “pretty conceits,” such as\r\nhad so amused Sir Henry Wotton at Eton, the boy compared this bridge at\r\nRouen to the “vain amorists of outward greatnesse, whose spirits resent”\r\n(_i.e._ rise and fall with) “all the flouds and ebbs of that fortune it\r\nis built on.” And this so soon after Frank’s gay wedding in Whitehall!\r\n\r\nArrived in Paris on November 4, unmolested by brigands on their journey,\r\nMarcombes and the two boys spent some days in “that vast chaos of a\r\ncity,” where they were shown most of the “varieties,” and met several\r\nEnglish friends—among them one whom M. Marcombes heartily disliked,\r\nFrank’s new brother-in-law, Tom Killigrew, with the honeyed tongue,\r\nbrother of the little bride who had been left behind in the House of the\r\nSavoy. They also called on the English Ambassador; but the great event of\r\ntheir visit to Paris has been described in Marcombes’s first letter to\r\nthe Earl.[80]\r\n\r\nMr. Francis, he says, had been so troubled at the moment of his departure\r\nfrom the Savoy on account of his father’s anger against him, that he had\r\nquite forgotten where he had put his own sword and the case of pistols\r\nwhich the Earl had given the boys; and Marcombes had been obliged, when\r\nthey arrived at Paris, to buy them “a kaise of pistolles a piece”, not\r\nonly because of the dangerous state of the roads in France (witness the\r\nrobbery freshly committed in a wood), but because it was “yᵉ mode” in\r\nFrance for every gentleman to ride with pistols; and people would “Laugh\r\natt” the Earl’s hopeful sons if they were without them. A sword also\r\nhad been bought for Mr. Francis, and “when Mr. Robert saw it he did so\r\nearnestly desire me to buy him one, because his was out of fashion, that\r\nI could not refuse him that small request.”\r\n\r\nThey left Paris, with their new swords and pistols, a little company,\r\n“all well-horsed,” numbering some twenty altogether, and including\r\ntwo delightful “Polonian” Princes, who were “Princes by virtue and\r\neducation as well as birth.” It was a nine days’ journey to Lyons, and\r\non the way they rested, among other places, at Moulins, which the future\r\nexperimentalist remembered for its “fine tweezes.” But romance was at\r\nthis time nearer to the boy’s heart than chemistry; their way had lain\r\nthrough a part of the French Arcadia, “the pleasant _Pays de Forest_,\r\nwhere the Marquis d’Urfé had laid the scene of the adventures and amours\r\nof that Astrea with whom so many gallants are still in love, long after\r\nboth his and her decease.”[81]\r\n\r\nLyons itself, where they stayed for a time, seemed to Robert Boyle\r\n“a town of great resort and trading, but fitter for the residence of\r\nmerchants than of gentlemen.” They crossed the mountains that had\r\nformerly belonged to the Duke of Savoy, but were now in the territory of\r\nthe French king, and they saw the Rhone in its narrowest part, between\r\nthe rocks, “where it is no such large stride to stand on both his banks”;\r\nand after three days’ journey from Lyons, they reached Geneva, a little\r\nCommonwealth whose quick and steady prosperity under the “reformed\r\nreligion” had made it the theme “not only of discourse but of some degree\r\nof wonder.” There, for nearly two years, the boys were to board with M.\r\nMarcombes and his wife and family, and to find themselves in a little\r\nready-made circle of friends; for Barrymore and Kynalmeaky had been\r\nthere together, and boarded at the Villa Diodati. Philip Burlamachy, the\r\nformer Lord Mayor of London, who did so much business with the Earl of\r\nCork, and who, it will be remembered, had recommended Marcombes to the\r\nEarl, belonged to Geneva, and was related by marriage to the Diodati\r\nfamily there; and Mr. Diodato Diodati, the banker, and Dr. John Diodati,\r\nthe famous Italian Protestant preacher, were among the chief Genevan\r\nresidents. “The church government,” wrote John Evelyn about Geneva, only\r\na year or two later, “is severely Presbyterian, after the discipline of\r\nCalvin and Beza, who set it up; but nothing so rigid as either our Scots\r\nor English sectaries of that denomination.”\r\n\r\nGeneva was, as Marcombes had pointed out to the Earl when he took the\r\nboys there, not only a very convenient place for himself—for his home\r\nand family were there—but “by reason of the pure air and the notable\r\nStrangers always passing through it, and the conveniences for all kinds\r\nof Learning there, a very good place for the two boys to be educated\r\nin.” They would be among those who though “farr from puritanisme” were\r\nvery orthodox and religious men, and they would be in no danger from\r\nconversation with “Jesuits, friars, priests, or any persons ill-affected\r\nto their religion, king or state.” In a word, Frank and Robyn were to be\r\nbred in a commonwealth of educated toleration; and its fine influences\r\nwere to remain with Robert Boyle—who lived there a little longer than his\r\nbrother—all through his life.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, Marcombes wrote comfortable letters to the Earl in\r\nLondon. Supplies of money had, so far, come regularly; but as yet no\r\nletters had arrived from the Earl of Cork, who was, as will be seen\r\nlater, beset by family cares and public anxieties. Marcombes and the\r\nboys had settled down to regular lessons at set hours. The lessons were\r\nto include rhetoric and logic, arithmetic and Euclid, geography, the\r\ndoctrine of the spheres and globe, and fortification. They were to take\r\nlessons with a fencing-master and a dancing-master, and they played at\r\nmall and tennis—this last a sport that Robert Boyle “ever passionately\r\nloved.” And they read together in a “voluminous but excellent work”\r\ncalled _Le Monde_; but above all Robyn, if not Frank, was indulged in the\r\nreading of romances, which not only “extreamely diverted” him, but also\r\ntaught him French. And as they talked no English, but “all and allwayes\r\nFrench,” Robert became very soon “perfect” in the French tongue, while\r\nFrank could “express himself in all companies.”[82]\r\n\r\nMarcombes was evidently very proud of having a second batch of the Earl\r\nof Cork’s sons put under his care; and Frank and Robyn proved pupils\r\nmore to his taste than Kynalmeaky and Broghill had been. For one thing,\r\nthey had come to him fresh from school; and he found the very young\r\nbridegroom and the younger philosopher, “noble, virtuous, discreet\r\nand disciplinable.” “I think”, he wrote to the Earl, “I neede not much\r\nRhetorike for to persuade your Lordship that Mr. Robert Loves his booke\r\nwith all his heart.” And Robert also danced extremely well; and so\r\nanxious was he to excel in fencing, that the good-natured Marcombes was\r\n“almost afraid yᵗ he should have left a quarell unperfect in England.” As\r\nfor Frank, he was taking to his lessons with a “facilitie and passion”\r\nthat surprised Marcombes, seeing that the boy had “tasted a little drope\r\nof yᵉ Libertinage of yᵉ Court.” Francis had been well provided with\r\nclothes in London; but Master Robert had been furnished in Geneva with a\r\ncomplete black satin suit, the cloak lined with plush; and Marcombes gave\r\nthe boys every month “a piece yᵉ value of very neare two pounds sterlings\r\nfor their passe time.”\r\n\r\nThat first winter in Geneva was an exceptionally cold one, and a great\r\ndeal of snow had fallen “on yᵉ grounde.” The Governour’s letters to\r\nthe Earl reported the boys to be growing apace. Mr. Francis’s legs and\r\narms were considerably bigger than when he left England. The mountain\r\nair and the dancing and fencing were doing both boys good, though Mr.\r\nRobert still preferred sitting by himself, “with some book of history\r\nor other”—the romances are not mentioned—and required some persuasion\r\n“to playe at tennisse and to goe about.” He was, however, in excellent\r\nhealth. “I never saw him handsomer,” wrote Marcombes to the Earl; “for\r\nalthough he growes so much, yet he is very fatt and his cheeks as red as\r\nvermilion.” The frosty air had brought them “to such a stomacke that your\r\nLordship should take a great pleasure to see them feed.\r\n\r\n“I doe not give them Daintys,” he wrote: “but I assure your Lordship that\r\nthey have allwayes good bred and Good wine, good beef and mouton, thrice\r\na week, good capons and good fish, constantly disches of fruit and a Good\r\npiece of cheese: all kind of cleane linen twice and thrice a weeke, and a\r\nConstant fire in their chamber, where they have a good bedd for them and\r\nanother for their men.”\r\n\r\nMarcombes describes in detail the order of their days in the Genevan\r\nhousehold. Every morning during their first months in Geneva he taught\r\nthem rhetoric and Latin; and after dinner they read two chapters of the\r\nOld Testament—with “expositions” from Marcombes on those points they did\r\nnot understand; and before supper they read Roman history in French,\r\nand repeated “yᵉ catechisme of Calvin with yᵉ most orthodox exposition”\r\nof difficult points; and after supper they read two chapters of the New\r\nTestament. And they said their prayers morning and evening, and twice a\r\nweek they went to church. “There is, my Lord,” ended Marcombes, with a\r\nlittle flourish of self-satisfaction, “a Compendium of our employment!”\r\n\r\nBut all these months no answers to their various letters had come from\r\nthe Earl in London. They had left London on October 28, and it was\r\napparently the middle of February before the boys heard from their\r\nfather; and then two packets of his long-expected letters, both written\r\nin January, arrived together. The formal, reverential little letters\r\nwhich the boys were in the habit of penning to the Earl were letters\r\nchiefly remarkable for their beginnings and endings. They usually began\r\n“My most honoured Lord and Father,” and ended with some such peroration,\r\nas “with my dayly prayers to God for your Lordship’s long life, health\r\nand happiness, and with the desire to be esteemed all my life, My Lord,\r\nyour most dutiful and obedient Son and humblest Servant.”\r\n\r\nA modern reader would scarcely credit, from such a peroration, the\r\nexistence of a deep natural affection; and there was certainly not the\r\nkind of untrammelled love of the modern child for the modern parent. And\r\nyet the ornate solemnity of these little seventeenth-century letters only\r\ncloaked the tender humanity beneath. It was but a literary form; and\r\nunder it, in spite of the foster-parentage of babyhood, the subservience\r\nof youth, and the rigour of parental authority, the strong human love\r\nwas there in the seventeenth century as now. When the long-expected\r\npackets arrived at M. Marcombes’s house in Geneva, and the boys gathered\r\nabout their governour to receive their father’s letters, so overjoyed\r\nand excited was the “Spiritay Robyn” that his hesitation of speech—which\r\nhad almost disappeared—returned in full force; and for some minutes he\r\nstammered and stuttered so atrociously that Frank and Marcombes could\r\nscarcely understand what he was saying, and had much ado to “forbeare\r\nLaughing.”\r\n\r\nAnd what was the Earl’s news? Much had been happening in London, both\r\ninside and outside the House of the Savoy, since October 1639; but\r\nevidently only an abridged edition reached Marcombes and the boys in\r\nGeneva.\r\n\r\nLady Barrymore had been very ill, but was recovering. Lady Dungarvan,[83]\r\nwhose second little girl had died at Salisbury House, in London, before\r\nthe boys left London, had a little son at last; but “lyttle Franck,” the\r\nDublin-born daughter, remained the old Earl’s pet. The heir was born\r\non November 17 in the House of the Savoy, and christened in the Savoy\r\nChapel by the name of “Charles,” the King himself standing sponsor,\r\nwhile the Countess of Salisbury was godmother, and the other godfather\r\nwas the Marquis of Hamilton. But the great news of all was the news of\r\nKynalmeaky’s marriage—a very splendid marriage it had been—with the Lady\r\nElizabeth Fielding, one of the ladies of the Queen’s privy chamber, and\r\ndaughter of the Earl and Countess of Denbigh. Their other daughter was\r\nmarried to the Marquis of Hamilton, and the Countess of Denbigh herself\r\nwas a sister of the King’s favourite, the murdered Buckingham.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Lord Kynalmeaky and the Lady Elizabeth Fielding had\r\nbeen arranged under royal auspices. The King had dowered the lady, and\r\nthe wedding, like Frank’s, had been in the Royal Chapel of Whitehall.\r\nThe King had given away the bride, and “put about her neck” the Queen’s\r\ngift of a rich pearl necklace, “worth £1500.” There was much revelling,\r\ndancing and feasting afterwards, and the King and Queen “did the young\r\ncouple all honour and grace.” The Earl of Cork, always a strange mixture\r\nof generosity and thrift, had supplied £100 for Kynalmeaky’s wedding\r\ngarments, and lent him “my son Franck’s wedding shoes” for the occasion.\r\n\r\nBroghill also was to be married. “Your friend Broghill,” the Earl wrote\r\nto Marcombes, “is in a fair way of being married to Mrs. Harrison, one of\r\nthe Queen’s maids of honour, about whom a difference happened yesterday\r\nbetween Mr. Thomas Howard, the Earl of Berkshire’s son and him, which\r\nbrought them into the field; but thanks be to God, Broghill came home\r\nwithout any hurt, and the other gentleman was not much harmed; and now\r\nthey have clashed swords together they are grown good friends. I think\r\nin my next I shall advise you that my daughter Mary is nobly married, and\r\nthat in the spring I shall send her husband to keep company with my sons\r\nin Geneva.”[84]\r\n\r\nThe old Earl, when he wrote to Marcombes in January 1640, did not guess\r\nthe sequels to these two little romances. For though the wedding clothes\r\nwere making, Broghill was never to marry Mrs. Harrison, whom he, like\r\nmany other gallants, had “passionately loved.” On the contrary, it was\r\nMr. Thomas Howard, “not much harmed,” who was to be the happy man; and\r\nthe lady whom Broghill was presently to marry was the Lady Margaret\r\nHoward, the beautiful daughter of the Earl and Countess of Suffolk, and a\r\ncousin of Mr. Thomas Howard. The two young men had clashed swords to some\r\npurpose; but Lord Broghill’s marriage with Lady Margaret Howard comes\r\ninto another chapter.\r\n\r\nNobody exactly knows who was the noble suitor that was to marry\r\nMary Boyle and be packed off to Geneva like a schoolboy immediately\r\nafterwards. For Mary Boyle had once more expressed her “very high\r\naverseness and contradicon” to the Earl’s counsels and commands. She had\r\nagain refused Mr. James Hamilton, though all her brothers and sisters\r\nand several of her brothers-in-law, and all her best friends—poor\r\nlittle unruly Mary!—“did entreat and persuade,” and the old Earl “did\r\ncommand.” Vanquished for once, the Earl of Cork had been in treaty with\r\nmore than one other youthful suitor for Mary’s hand. But Mary Boyle has\r\ntold her own story.[85] “Living so much at my ease,” she says, “I was\r\nunwilling to change my condition.” After Frank’s marriage, his wife\r\nBetty lived with the Earl in the House of the Savoy, where she and Mary\r\nBoyle became close friends and “chamber fellows.” Betty obtained “a\r\ngreat and ruling power” over Mary, “inticing her to spend” (as she did)\r\n“her time in seeing and reading plays and romances, and in exquisite\r\nand curious dressing.” Betty Boyle had many of the young gallants of\r\nthe Court at her beck and call, and one of them was Mr. Charles Rich,\r\nsecond son of the Earl of Warwick. Charles Rich was “a very cheerful and\r\nhandsome, well-bred and fashioned person, and being good company, was\r\nvery acceptable to us all, and so became very intimate in our house,\r\nvisiting us almost every day.” Charles Rich also had been in love with\r\nMrs. Harrison, but not so deeply as to prevent his acting as Mr. Thomas\r\nHoward’s second in the duel; and after that for a time he had considered\r\nit only civil to absent himself from the House of the Savoy. When he\r\ndid come again it was to transfer his attentions to the Lady Mary; and\r\nFrank’s wife played go-between. “A most diligent gallant to me,” says\r\nMary of Charles Rich, many long years after their forbidden love-making\r\nand runaway marriage; “applying himself, when there were no other\r\nbeholders in the room but my sister, to me; but if any other person came\r\nin he took no more than ordinary notice of me.” And every night when Mary\r\nlaid her little unruly head upon the pillow she resolved that Charles\r\nRich must be given his dismissal, and that Betty must be told never again\r\nto mention him to her as a husband. And somehow every morning it seemed\r\nimpossible to carry out her resolution; and she made her toilet, and\r\nput on her most exquisite and curious dress, and looked the proud and\r\ncharming little lady that she was.\r\n\r\nBut Marcombes and the boys in Geneva knew nothing of all this; and for\r\nthat matter neither as yet did the old Earl. The noble suitor about\r\nwhom he was in treaty when he wrote to Geneva was certainly not Charles\r\nRich—who was only a second son, “with £1300 or £1400 a year at the most”;\r\nand who, if he dared to pay his court to the Earl of Cork’s youngest\r\ndaughter, must do it clandestinely with the connivance of Betty Boyle.\r\n\r\nThe spring and summer of 1640 passed uneventfully in the Marcombes\r\nhousehold. Spring and summer in Geneva; the peaceful little Calvinist\r\ntown, basking under a hot sun and a blue sky; the bluer waters of the\r\nLake with the big-winged boats upon it; the vivid greens of the middle\r\ndistances, and the far-away mountain-peaks white with the everlasting\r\nsnows! And the lessons went on as usual, the boys giving their governour\r\n“all yᵉ satisfaction of yᵉ worlde”.... “I would I was as able to teache\r\nas Mr. Robert is able to conceave and to Learne.” It is true that the\r\nwitty and wicked Tom Killigrew came down on them from Paris, and favoured\r\nthem with a little of his “sweet and delectable conversation”; but\r\nMarcombes told the Earl that he did not think Mr. Killigrew would stay\r\nlong in Geneva, “which perhaps will be yᵉ better for your Sons.” When he\r\ndid depart, he left with Marcombes a fine watch and some ruby buttons to\r\nbe sent to his sister Betty in London. And the little household settled\r\ndown again—rhetoric and logic to be succeeded by mathematics, history\r\nand geography, the chief points of religion, and more dancing-lessons.\r\nMr. Francis was learning to vault. He and Marcombes had received the\r\nSacrament at five o’clock on Easter morning; but Mr. Robert would not\r\nreceive it, “excusing himself upon his yonge age,” though Marcombes\r\nassured the Earl he did not abstain “for want of good instruction upon yᵉ\r\nmatter.” In June they had gone a little jaunt into the Savoy country. “We\r\nwere two days abroad,” wrote Marcombes to the Earl, “and were never so\r\nmerry in our lives.”\r\n\r\nBut were the boys so merry? Frank, influenced perhaps by Tom Killigrew\r\nand the letters which came from his little wife at home, was beginning to\r\nbe restive, and begging his father to allow them to go on into Italy, and\r\nso be the sooner home again. And Robert Boyle?\r\n\r\nIt was in the very heat of that summer of 1640 that there happened\r\nto Robert Boyle “an accident which he always used to mention as the\r\nconsiderablest of his whole life.”\r\n\r\n“To frame a right apprehension of this,” he says in his _Philaretus_,\r\n“you must understand that though his inclinations were ever virtuous,\r\nand his life free from scandal and inoffensive, yet had the piety he was\r\nmaster of already so diverted him from aspiring unto more, that Christ,\r\nwho long had lain asleep in his conscience (as he once did in the ship)\r\nmust now, as then, be waked by a storm.”[86]\r\n\r\nAbout the dead of night, after a long, hot summer day, he had suddenly\r\nwakened to find himself in the midst of one of those thunderstorms so\r\nindescribably grand and terrible among the Alps. He “thought the earth\r\nwould owe an ague to the air,” and every clap was both preceded and\r\nattended with flashes of lightning so frequent and so dazzling that he\r\nbegan to imagine them “the sallies of that fire that must consume the\r\nworld.”[87]\r\n\r\nThe winds almost drowned the noise of the thunder. The rains almost\r\nquenched the flashes of lightning. The Day of Judgment seemed at hand;\r\nand the consideration of his “unpreparedness to welcome it, and the\r\nhideousness of being surprised by it in an unfit condition,” made the boy\r\n“resolve and vow that if his fears were that night disappointed, all his\r\nfurther additions to his life should be more religiously and watchfully\r\nemployed. The morning came, and a serener cloudless sky returned, when he\r\nratified his determination so solemnly that from that day he dated his\r\nconversion; renewing, now he was past danger, the vow he had made whilst\r\nhe believed himself to be in it.”\r\n\r\nAfterwards, Robyn blushed to remember that the vow had been made only\r\nin fear; but he comforted himself by thinking that “the more deliberate\r\nconsecration of himself to piety had been made when the earth and sky had\r\nregained their equanimity, and with no less motive than that of its own\r\nexcellence.” The hour of terror had been also the hour of realisation.\r\nThis trembling child, already a student of Nature, had begun amidst\r\nthe winds and lightnings to realise dimly the existence of Elemental\r\nMysteries which made the whole world tremble too. And yet, did not even\r\nthese atmospheric exacerbations flash and thunder out the command to\r\npraise Him and magnify Him for ever? Were not the deepest, most terrible\r\nof Elemental Mysteries but part of a Universal Benedicite?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE DEBACLE\r\n\r\n    “But (as when in summer we take up our grass-horses into the\r\n    stable, and give them store of oats, it is a sign that we mean\r\n    to travel them) our Philaretus, soon after he had received this\r\n    new strength, found a new weight to support.”—ROBERT BOYLE’S\r\n    _Philaretus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1641, some months after the thunderstorm episode,\r\nMarcombes bought horses, and they set out on a three weeks’ tour in the\r\nneighbouring country. The Earl had not yet given his permission for the\r\nItalian tour, and Francis and Robert had been sixteen months at their\r\nlessons, and were beginning to long for a holiday. Riding and walking,\r\nthey visited Chambéry, Aix, and Grenoble, and then found their way into\r\n“the wild mountains where the first and chiefest of the Carthusian Abbies\r\ndoes stand seated.” Robyn’s “conversion” by the thunderstorm appears to\r\nhave been quite unknown to Frank and Marcombes: they had no conception of\r\nthe thoughts that were churning in the boy’s head.\r\n\r\nIt was the Devil, so Robert Boyle says in his _Philaretus_, who, taking\r\nadvantage of the deep raving melancholy of the place, and the pictures\r\nand stories to be found in the Monastery of Bruno,[88] the Father of\r\nthe Order, tempted him with “such hideous thoughts and such distracting\r\ndoubts of some of the fundamentals of Christianity, that, though his\r\nlooks did little betray his thoughts, nothing but the forbiddenness of\r\nself-dispatch hindered his acting it.”\r\n\r\nIt was more probably an acute attack of home-sickness, following on a\r\nprolonged diet of “yᵉ catechisme of Calvin”; but it was remembered, by\r\nthis sensitive boy, as a very real temptation. He wrote to his father\r\nwhen they returned to Geneva, mentioning the little tour only as one\r\n“wherein we have had some pleasure mingled with some paines.” It was a\r\nsad little letter: “Your Lordship seems,” says Robyn, “to be angry with\r\nmy brother and I.” They had not written often, or fully enough; and\r\nletters that are all beginnings and endings do not tell much. Marcombes,\r\non the other hand, wrote ebulliently to the Earl. He never forgot to\r\nsing the praises of his pupils—Robyn, especially, was _semper idem_, and\r\n“Capable of all good things”; while the nature and disposition of both\r\nboys were “as good and sweete as any in the worlde.”\r\n\r\nOn their return to Geneva, they had found letters from the Earl, giving\r\nthem leave to travel into Italy; and during the summer of 1641 the boys\r\nwere “fincing”, and “dansing”, and learning Italian, and holding their\r\nheads well and their bodies straight, and Mr. Francis was now taller than\r\nmy Lord Dungarvan, while as for Mr. Robert, he was “an Eale”, tall for\r\nhis age, and big proportionably. They rose betimes, loved to ride abroad,\r\nand always came home with “a very good stomacke.” And as Marcombes\r\nassured the Earl that they went regularly to church, and in private also\r\n“sarved God very religiously”, it may be supposed that the months of\r\n“tedious perplexity”, of which Robert Boyle speaks in his _Philaretus_\r\nand of which Marcombes and Frank knew nothing, were drawing to a close.\r\nThere came a day, indeed, when Robyn no longer excused himself from\r\nreceiving the Sacrament by reason of his “yonge age.” It pleased God,\r\nhe says, one day that he had taken the Sacrament to restore to him “the\r\nwithdrawn sense of his favour.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the Earl of Cork had given his permission, he was very dubious\r\nabout the wisdom of the Italian journey.\r\n\r\n“For,” wrote the Earl in London to Marcombes in Geneva, “we have lately\r\nhad a popish priest hanged, drawn and quartered; and a many moe in prison\r\nwhich I think wilbe brought to the like cloudy end, for that they did not\r\ndepart the Kingdome by the prefixed date lymited by the late statute.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl’s friends in London, “suspecting revenge,” had advised\r\nhim against the Italian journey, and drawn horrible pictures of an\r\nInquisition worse than death. But the old man was anxious to satisfy the\r\nboys’ desires, and really wanted them to learn Italian, and to see “all\r\nthose brave Universities, States, Cities, Churches, and other remarkeable\r\nthings”[89] which only Italy could show them. And so they were to go; but\r\nMarcombes was to take great care of them, and to remember that the Earl\r\nwas entrusting “these my Jewells” to him in a strange country.\r\n\r\nIn preparation for Italy, Madame Marcombes was making for them all kinds\r\nof new linen; and Marcombes bought for them three suits of clothes\r\napiece, and they were to have more when they reached Florence—“where I\r\ndoe intend to keep them a coach, God willing.”\r\n\r\nMarcombes was anxious that the Earl should obtain for them a letter (in\r\nLatin) from the King, “to all Kings, Princes, Magistrates,” etc., in\r\nwhich Marcombes himself should be named “by name and surname.” And they\r\nought also, he said, to have a special licence from the King to allow\r\nthem to travel in Rome, “least your Lordship or your sons should be\r\nquestioned hereafter.” The Genevan household were up in arms against Tom\r\nKilligrew, who had gone home and reported, most untruly, that Marcombes\r\nwas keeping the boys short of clothes and pocket money.\r\n\r\nIn July 1641 Robyn wrote again to his father. The Earl seems to have been\r\nstill angry with “my brother and I”:—“My most honoured Lord and father,\r\nI desire with passion and without any question to go into Italy, but I\r\nprotest unto your Lordship that I doe not desire it half so much as to\r\nheare from your Lp; for the three moneths (or Thereabouts) that we have\r\nbeen deprived of that sweet communication seem to me 3 long Ages, and\r\nwould to god that the interruption of that pleasing commerce may proceede\r\nfrom your private and publique employments.”\r\n\r\nMarcombes also had written to the Earl of Cork. He dared not be so bold,\r\nhe said, as to beg for some news of “yᵉ affaires of yᵉ Island.” They,\r\nin Geneva, had heard of Strafford’s death, “yᵉ catastrophe of yᵉ last\r\nDeputy of Ireland”; but they did not know who was his successor,[90] or\r\nwhat had become of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and of “yᵉ armys both of\r\nEngland and Scotland.” In Geneva, by the grace of God, they were enjoying\r\na profound peace: “yᵉ storme having been driving another way.”\r\n\r\nIt was September 1641 when the boys and their governour, all “well\r\nhorsed”, bade good-bye to Madame and the children, and set off on their\r\nlong-talked-of Italian journey. Once more they crossed the “hideous\r\nmountains”; they saw the source of the Rhine “but a brook,” and came down\r\nin the valley of Valtollina, a little earthly paradise abounding “with\r\nall that Ceres and Bacchus are able to present.”\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle always remembered standing on the spot where the little\r\ntown of Piur, “once esteemed for its deliciousness,” had about a quarter\r\nof a century before been suddenly submerged and buried so deep that “no\r\nafter search by digging has ever prevailed to reach it.” And still among\r\nthe Alps, but surrounded by higher mountains, “where store of crystal\r\nis digged,” and which “like perpetual penitents do all the year wear\r\nwhite,” the boy found himself, for the first time in his life, _above\r\nthe clouds_. He never forgot how, as they descended _la Montagna di\r\nMorbegno_, he looked down on the clouds that darkened the middle of the\r\nmountain below them, while he and his companions were above, in “clear\r\nserenity.”\r\n\r\nFrom the Grisons they passed into Venetian territory and the vast and\r\ndelicious plains of Lombardy, through Bergamo, Brescia, Verona, Vincenza\r\nand Padua, to Venice, Bologna, Ferrara and Florence. They were very\r\nyoung; and their “peregrination” must not be compared in the matter\r\nof sightseeing and adventure with John Evelyn’s tour taken over much\r\nthe same ground—only the reverse way—a year or two later. At Florence\r\nthey sold their horses, and settled down for the winter of 1641-2; and\r\nthere they resumed their lessons, Italian chiefly and “modern history”;\r\nand Robyn read the _Lives of the Old Philosophers_, and became so\r\nenamoured of the Stoics that he insisted on “enduring a long fit of the\r\ntoothache with great unconcernedness.”[91] In all his journeys, he had\r\ncarried his pet books with him. Frank laughed at his younger brother’s\r\ninveterate habit of reading as he walked—“if they were upon the road, and\r\nwalking down a hill, or in a rough way, he would read all the way; and\r\nwhen they came at night to their inn, he would still be studying till\r\nsupper, and frequently propose such difficulties as he met with, to his\r\ngovernour.”[92]\r\n\r\nWhile they were wintering at Florence, Galileo died “within a league of\r\nit.” They never saw him; but they read and heard a great deal about the\r\n“paradoxes of the great Star Gazer”; and Robert carried away with him\r\nfrom Italy an undying memory of the attitude of the Romish Church to\r\nscientific discovery. Galileo’s paradoxes had been “confuted” by a decree\r\nfrom Rome, “perhaps because they could not be so otherwise”; and the Pope\r\nhad shown himself “loth to have the stability of that earth questioned,\r\nin which he had established his kingdom.” It was in Florence that Robert\r\nBoyle heard the story told of the friars who reproached Galileo with his\r\nblindness, telling him it was “a just punishment of heaven”, and of the\r\nsightless astronomer’s memorable answer: “He had the satisfaction of not\r\nbeing blind till he had seen in heaven what never mortal eyes beheld\r\nbefore.” In Florence, Marcombes and his pupils lodged in the same house\r\nwith some “Jewish Rabbins,” from whom Robyn learned a great deal about\r\npre-Christian “arguments and tenets.” Frank, perhaps, was more interested\r\nin the carnaval, and the ducal tilts, and the gentlemen’s balls, to which\r\nboth the brothers were invited. And Marcombes took good care of the\r\nEarl’s “jewells”, though they were allowed to look open-eyed upon all\r\nthe vice, as well as the splendour, of seventeenth-century Italy: “the\r\nimpudent nakedness of vice” Robert called it then and afterwards. He had\r\nnever found, he used to say, “any such sermons against the things he then\r\nsaw as they were against themselves.”[93]\r\n\r\nIn March 1642 they were in Rome, where it was thought safest for\r\nRobert to pass for a Frenchman. English Protestants were at the moment\r\nespecially unpopular, and Master Robyn was less willing than his brother\r\nFrank to “do at Rome as the Romans do.” Rome itself indeed seems to have\r\ndisappointed the young Puritan. After all his studies in Latin history\r\nand literature, it was a disappointment to find Rome dominated, not\r\nby victorious legions, but by what he called “present superstition.”\r\nHe found Modern Popes where the Ancient Cæsars should have been, and\r\n“Barberine bees flying as high as did the Roman Eagle.” It was a\r\ncome-down, certainly; but the little party did a good deal of sightseeing\r\nof the simple kind; and they saw the Pope and his Cardinals in chapel,\r\nand Robyn’s observant eyes watched a young churchman after the service\r\n“upon his knees carefully with his feet sweep into his handkerchief” the\r\ndust that had been consecrated by his Holiness’s feet. Robert Boyle did\r\nnot gather up any dust; but he obtained and read the Latin and Tuscan\r\npoems written by this same Pope. “A poet he was,” was Robyn’s verdict of\r\nPope Urban VIII; a poet—and some other things besides.\r\n\r\nTo escape the heat of Rome they returned to Florence, by Perugia and\r\nPistoia, and thence by the river Arno to Pisa and Livorno. From Livorno\r\nthey coasted in a felucca, drawing up their boat on shore every night\r\nand sleeping in some Mediterranean townlet, to Genoa; and so, travelling\r\nby slow degrees, by Monaco, Mentone, Nice and Antibes, they reached\r\nMarseilles in May 1642.\r\n\r\nAt Marseilles, they expected to find letters from the Earl of Cork,\r\nand bills of exchange to carry them on to Paris. Hitherto, though\r\ndifficulties of transit had now and then arisen, their quarterly\r\nallowance had been punctually sent. The Earl had allowed them £500 a year\r\nin Geneva, and £1000 a year while they were in Italy; and the money had\r\nalways come to hand, thanks to the combined activities of Mr. Perkins\r\nthe tailor, Mr. Philip Burlamachy, a certain Mr. Castell, “merchant\r\nstranger,” who travelled between England and Geneva, and, last but not\r\nleast, Mr. Diodato Diodati, the Genevan banker. Once or twice while they\r\nwere in Italy letters had come from home, and they knew vaguely that\r\nsinister things had been happening there. And Frank and Betty wrote\r\nto each other: Betty was begging Frank to come back to her, and even\r\nthreatening to come to him; and so terror-struck was Marcombes at the\r\nbare suggestion that he was looking “very narrowly” after poor Frank. He\r\nhad of late been keeping Frank very short of money, lest he might do “I\r\ndoe not kgnow what.”\r\n\r\nAnd then at Marseilles, even while they were idly waiting for their bills\r\nof exchange and watching the French King’s galleys put to sea with about\r\ntwo thousand slaves tugging at the oars, there came to Francis and Robyn,\r\nand to Marcombes too, for that matter, a rude awakening.\r\n\r\n“Ye affaires of ye Island” had been going from bad to worse. Wentworth’s\r\ntragic end was almost an old story in May 1642, so quickly had events\r\nbeen hurrying on. He had got his earldom at last, in January 1640. For\r\none little year he was indeed Earl of Strafford and Lord Lieutenant of\r\nIreland; he had headed the loan to King Charles for the expenses of the\r\nsecond “Bishops’” War. Strafford was in the King’s Cabinet, and the\r\nEarl of Cork had been made a Privy Councillor. On April 13, 1640, the\r\n“Short Parliament” had met, and it had been dissolved on May 5—“the\r\ndoleful Tuesday, when the Parliament was dissolved before any Act was\r\npassed.”[94] The Earl and his family were back at Stalbridge in July; and\r\nnow it was Broghill’s turn to raise “a Hundred Horse for Scotland,” and\r\nKynalmeaky and Barrymore and George Goring were all bound for the North\r\nin the second “Bishops’ War”. But by November the war was over, and the\r\nParliament (that was to be the Long Parliament) had met. On November 11,\r\nStrafford was impeached and called to the Bar of the House on his knees\r\n(“I sitting in my place covered,” wrote the Earl of Cork in his diary);\r\nand on November 25 Strafford was in the Tower. All through the London\r\nwinter of 1640, and right on into the spring of 1641, Strafford and\r\nStrafford’s trial filled the minds of all men, not in London only, but\r\nthroughout England, Scotland and Ireland. During those fateful months,\r\nthe diary gives one or two vivid glimpses of the Earl’s old enemy. There\r\nis no description of the scenes in the Houses, or the trial itself in\r\nWestminster Hall; the grim pageant of Lords and Commons; the plates of\r\nmeat and bottles of drink being handed from mouth to mouth; the royalties\r\nin their little trellissed rooms; the King apart, “anxiously taking\r\nnotes”; the ladies also, moved by pity, with paper, pens and ink before\r\nthem, “discoursing upon the grounds of law and state”[95]. None of these\r\nthings finds a place in the diary. The Earl’s old eyes were fixed upon\r\nStrafford, and Strafford only: Strafford on his knees before the Bar,\r\nwith his six attendant lawyers; Strafford bringing his answer—his “18\r\nskins of parchment, close-written”—into the House of Peers; Strafford\r\nattempting, in his own defence, to “blemish” the Earl of Cork with\r\n“accusations....”[96]\r\n\r\nIt was a grim time. And yet, such is human life, while Strafford was in\r\nthe Tower and the Committee of the Commons preparing his indictment, all\r\nLondon was talking of my Lord Broghill’s brilliant marriage with the\r\nLady Margaret Howard, daughter of the late Earl of Suffolk, in “the Lord\r\nDaubigne’s house in Queenes street covent garden.”[97]\r\n\r\n    “At Charing Cross hard by the way\r\n    Where we (thou knowst) do sell our hay,\r\n    There is a house with stairs....”\r\n\r\nThere is no description of Broghill’s wedding from the Earl of Cork’s\r\npen; but Sir John Suckling has left a very graphic account of it in his\r\n“Ballad upon a Wedding,” which, it is said, was hawked about the London\r\nstreets at the time.[98]\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom, “pestilent fine,” walked on before all the rest:—London\r\nhad not forgotten the duel with Mr. Thomas Howard.\r\n\r\n    “But wot you what? the youth was going\r\n    To make an end of all his wooing.”\r\n\r\nAnd the bride was a beautiful creature: the blush on her cheek was like\r\na Catharine pear—“the side that’s next the sun”; while her red underlip\r\nlooked as if “some bee had stung it newly.”\r\n\r\n    “Her finger was so small the ring,\r\n    Would not stay on which they did bring,\r\n    ...\r\n    Her feet beneath her petticoat,\r\n    Like little mice, stole in and out\r\n                As if they feared the light.”\r\n\r\nThis was the bride for whom Broghill had forgotten Mrs. Harrison and the\r\nduel in which nobody was hurt. This was the beautiful “Lady Pegg,” who\r\nwas to prove herself a woman “beautiful in her person, very moderate\r\nin her expences, and plain in her garb; serious and decent in her\r\nbehaviour, careful in her family, and tender of her lord”[99]—nay, more,\r\nin Broghill’s after-life it is easy to see that he had not only a brave\r\nhelpmeet, but a clever one. Robert Boyle himself has called her the\r\n“great support, ornament, and comfort of her Family.”[100]\r\n\r\nThe old Earl was in his place when, after many long debates and “sevral\r\nheerings”, Strafford was sentenced to death—only eleven voices of all\r\nthe Lords declaring “not content”; and on May 12 Strafford—to whom\r\nthe King had pledged his word that not a hair of his head should be\r\ntouched—was beheaded on Tower Hill. “_As he well deserved_” is the brief\r\ncomment in the Earl of Cork’s diary.\r\n\r\nAnd what had the Earl’s young daughter, the “unrewly Mary,” been doing?\r\nShe and Frank’s wife, Betty, having spent the summer at Stalbridge with\r\nthe Earl and his customary house-party, were now back in town, staying\r\nwith Lady Dungarvan in her house in Long Acre. Betty had taken the\r\nmeasles, and Mary had promptly followed suit; and they had both been\r\npacked off to another house in Holborn. Charles Rich had shown such\r\nanxiety about Mary that the family’s suspicions were at last aroused;\r\nand Betty’s mamma, very much afraid of the Earl of Cork, had threatened\r\nto tell everything, “and in a great heat and passion did that very night\r\ndo it.”[101] Betty in the meantime contrived to give the lovers one more\r\nchance. Charles Rich went down on his knees before the convalescent Mary,\r\nand remained in that attitude for two hours, while Betty kept guard at\r\nthe door; and “so handsome did he express his passion” that Mary at last\r\nsaid “yes.” The very next day Broghill—himself a married man—carried his\r\nlittle sister off in disgrace to a very small house near Hampton Court\r\nwhich belonged to Betty’s sister, Mrs. Katharine Killigrew; and there for\r\nweeks Mary lived in exile, Charles Rich riding down daily to see her.\r\nHis father, the Earl of Warwick, and Lord Goring interceded with the old\r\nautocrat, and at last their combined influence carried the day The Earl\r\nsaw, “and was civil to,” Mr. Charles Rich, and Mary’s portion was to be\r\n£7000. It was now Mary who went down on her knees before her father,\r\nbegging for his pardon. The old man upbraided her, shed some tears, and\r\ntold her to marry Charles Rich as soon as she liked.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that this was enough, but no;—Mary Boyle at sixteen\r\nhad been “always a great enemy to a public marriage.” She much preferred\r\nrunning away. Charles Rich was quite willing, and the young people\r\nwere privately married on July 21, 1641, in the little parish church\r\nof Shepperton, near Hampton Court. And a few days later, Mary’s elder\r\nsister, the Lady Katharine Jones, too kind and too wise to be angry with\r\nso rare a thing as a love-match, especially when the wedding was over,\r\naccompanied the young couple in her carriage to the Earl of Warwick’s\r\nhouse of Leeze in Essex, and handed them over to the care of that\r\npatriarchal family.[102]\r\n\r\nSome of the Cork family,—the Barrymores, and Kynalmeaky, without his\r\nwife,—seem to have been already in Ireland in the autumn of 1641; and the\r\nEarl of Cork was making his own preparations to return to Lismore. He had\r\nbeen buying six black horses and harnesses for his new light travelling\r\ncoach, a sedan chair lined with carnation velvet, and a “horslytter,”\r\nwith two black stone coach-horses. August is a hot month for “feasting”\r\nin any case, and the summer of 1641 had been particularly hot, and the\r\nplague and smallpox were rife in London; but in August the old Earl had\r\nentertained at his Cousin Croone’s at the Nag’s Head Tavern in Cheapside\r\nall the Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen of the Committees of both Houses\r\nof Parliament for Ireland; and a few days later, Cousin Croone, at the\r\nNag’s Head, had “feasted” his great kinsman the Earl of Cork.\r\n\r\nDuring those last months also the Earl had been busy settling his\r\naffairs: there was the purchase of Marston Bigot in Somersetshire for\r\nBroghill and his wife, and the purchase of the smaller Devonshire estate\r\nof Annarye, and the settling of Stalbridge on Robert, his Benjamin. There\r\nwas the paying of debts and bonds and jointure moneys, and the packing,\r\nlocking, sealing and lettering of “yron chestes” and “lyttle trunckes”\r\nand “lyttle boxes,” to be left behind in the care of various trusted\r\nfriends. Among them were boxes of deeds and writings for Frank, to be\r\nleft with Betty’s stepfather, Sir Thomas Stafford; and at least two\r\nother boxes, “fast sealed”, for Robert, one of them to be left with the\r\nEarl’s friend, Lord Edward Howard of Escrick, and the other, containing\r\nduplicates, with the Earl’s own cousin, Peter Naylor, the lawyer, of New\r\nInn. Stalbridge was to belong to Robert after the Earl’s death, besides\r\nthe Irish lands already settled on him, and a house specially built for\r\nhim at Fermoy. And the old man had set his match-making old heart on a\r\nsplendid marriage for Robyn—with the Lady Ann Howard, the very young\r\ndaughter of Lord Edward Howard of Escrick, first cousin of “Lady Pegg.”\r\nOne of the Earl’s last rides in England was with his son Dungarvan to\r\nHatfield to take leave of the Salisbury family; and there also he saw “my\r\nRobyn’s yonge Mrs.,” to whom on this occasion the Earl presented “a small\r\ngold ring with a diamond.”\r\n\r\nThe last visit of all was to Leeze in Essex—carried there in Charles\r\nRich’s own coach—to bid good-bye to the beloved “unrewly Mary”. The last\r\nof the Earl’s many gifts in England appears to have been to an “infirme\r\ncozyn” of his own—a welcome gift from one old man to another—“a pott of\r\nSir Walter Raleigh’s tobackoe.”[103]\r\n\r\nThere were a good many leavetakings with English friends and kinsfolk\r\nbetween London and Stalbridge, and an almost royal progress from\r\nStalbridge by Marston Bigot—where he held a “Court”—to the coast. Lady\r\nKynalmeaky had been persuaded to accompany her father-in-law to Ireland,\r\nand Broghill and his wife crossed with them. The Dungarvans were,\r\napparently, to follow shortly after. Youghal was reached on October 17,\r\nand a day or two later the Earl and his family were at the House of\r\nLismore again.\r\n\r\nThe old biographers give a picturesque account of a great banquet at\r\nCastle Lyons in honour of the Earl’s home-coming. They tell how, while\r\nLord Barrymore was feasting his guests, the old Earl was called out\r\nof the banqueting hall to see a messenger, who, in a few breathless,\r\nhorror-stricken words, brought him tidings of the bloody outbreak of\r\nrebellion in Munster. A week or two later Lord Barrymore—the only one\r\nof the old Irish nobility to remain absolutely loyal to the Protestant\r\ncause—was buying ordnance for the defence of Castle Lyons. Lismore\r\nwas being strengthened and stored with ordnance, carbynes, muskets,\r\nGascoigne wines and aqua vitæ. Gunpowder and match were being bought in\r\nlarge quantities, money was being paid out on every hand—the Earl was\r\n“maintaining” everything and everybody—and money was getting ominously\r\nscarce. In December, Lady Kynalmeaky left Ireland for the Hague, and\r\nKynalmeaky took over the charge of Bandonbridge, with a troop of horse\r\nand 500 foot, “all English Protestants.” In January 1642, Broghill was\r\ndefending Lismore with a troop of horse and 200 “good shot.” He was a\r\ndependable son: “My lord,” he wrote to his father, “fear nothing for\r\nLismore, for if it be lost it shall be with the life of him that begs\r\nyour lordship’s blessing, and stiles him, my lord, your lordship’s most\r\nhumble, most obliged, and most dutiful son and servant, Broghill.” The\r\nold Earl himself had undertaken to hold Youghal, to keep the command of\r\nthat harbour, and to “preserve that towne”; and he was never to leave\r\nit. The sheet-lead on the “tarras” of the old college was to be torn\r\nup to make “case-shott” for his ordnance. Pikes, muskets, halberds and\r\n“brownbills”—everything in the shape of a weapon—were collected from\r\nDevonshire and Dorsetshire and everywhere else, and the “Mortall Sowe”\r\nwas to play a great part in the defence of Bandonbridge and Lismore.\r\nDungarvan, at the head of 1200 foot, was with the Lord President.[104]\r\nThe Protestant ladies had left, or were leaving, for England or the\r\nHague; but Dungarvan’s wife and Broghill’s wife stayed as long as\r\npossible on the spot.[105]\r\n\r\nIt was from Lismore—just before the Earl was sent to defend Youghal—that\r\nhe negotiated the bills of exchange to be sent through Perkins, the\r\nLondon tailor, to Marcombes: the quarterly allowance of £250 for the\r\nthree months from March 1 to June 1, 1642. And it was from Youghal, on\r\nMarch 9, that he sent the letter—one of the finest and saddest appeals\r\never written by a father to his children—that was to greet Marcombes and\r\nthe boys on their arrival at Marseilles.[106]\r\n\r\nIt is a long letter. The Earl had received their news from Florence, and\r\nwas glad to hear of their health and proficiency; but the thought of\r\nthem, and how hereafter they were to subsist, was most grievous unto him—\r\n\r\n“And now or never,” he wrote to Marcombes, “is the tyme for you to give\r\nyourself honour, and to make me and them your faithfull friends for ever\r\nhereafter. Necessitie compells me to make you and them know the dangerous\r\nand poore estate whereunto, by God’s providence, I am at this instant\r\nreduced.”\r\n\r\nAn account of the outbreak and course of the Rebellion follows; of\r\nDungarvan’s and Kynalmeaky’s and Broghill’s doings, and of the Earl’s\r\nown position in Youghal. It was a case of about “200,000 in armes and\r\nrebellion against a poor handful of British Protestants.”\r\n\r\nHe tells Marcombes how in January he had scraped together with much\r\ndifficulty—by selling of plate—the £250 for their quarterly allowance,\r\nand made it over to be paid by Mr. Perkins to Mr. Castell. So far he\r\nhad punctually supplied them—“which longer to doe I am no waies able.”\r\nThe £250, when they should receive it, must be husbanded carefully, and\r\nemployed to bring both boys home again. They must land at Dublin, Cork,\r\nor Youghal. If they cannot do this, they must go to Holland and serve\r\nunder the Prince of Orange. They must, in any case, manage to maintain\r\nthemselves: “for with inward greefe of soul I write this truth unto you\r\nthat I am no longer able to supply them ... but as I am compelled in my\r\nage to doe, so must they in their younger yeares com̃end themselves....\r\n\r\n“But if they serve God and be carefull and discreet in their carridge,\r\nGod will bless and provide for them as hitherto he hath done for me,\r\nwho began in the raising of my fortune by good endeavours; without any\r\nassistance of parents and friends....” And he knows Marcombes is too\r\ngenerous to leave the boys, “my two yong Sonnes that are soe deere unto\r\nme,” till he can see them safely shipped for Ireland or “well entred in\r\nthe warres of Holland”—as they may desire and Marcombes advise.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the letter that Marcombes and the two boys received at\r\nMarseilles. It was then May, and the letter was dated March 9; it was\r\nalready two months old. They must have looked blankly at each other. How\r\nwere they to carry out the Earl’s wishes? How were they both, without\r\nmoney, to make their way home? _No bill of exchange had reached them: Mr.\r\nPerkins, the London tailor, had played them false._\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been arranged between them that Frank, the elder\r\nbrother, who at nineteen would be of some use at his father’s side,\r\nshould, with Marcombes’s assistance, make his way as quickly as he could\r\nto Ireland and to Youghal. There is no mention of Betty in this moment\r\nof decision. Marcombes was evidently able to scrape together enough\r\nmoney out of what they still had to carry one of the boys home—and it\r\nwas to be Frank. And Robyn? Robyn at fifteen was an “Eale” still. Had\r\nMarcombes sometimes exaggerated, in his letters to the Earl, Robyn’s\r\nstature and strength? The sequel will show. Poor Carew, in the Eton days,\r\nand Marcombes himself, wrote of Robyn as a boy of sedentary habits, and\r\na little “thicke.” If the truth must be told, there was not much of the\r\nsoldier in Robert Boyle. He was the student, thinker, dreamer; and he\r\nknew himself to be unqualified, at fifteen, “to be received among the\r\ntroops.” And, without money, it was quite impossible to provide himself\r\nwith the necessary “equipage.”\r\n\r\nApparently they all three—Marcombes, Frank, and Robyn—went on as far as\r\nLyons; and there it seems likely they parted: Frank in the saddle, his\r\nhorse’s head turned towards Ireland, and Robyn and Marcombes returning in\r\ndeep melancholy to Geneva. There Robyn was to wait for further orders—to\r\nemploy his time in learning to make “an honourable living.” It is all\r\ntold in his sad little letter, written from Lyons to the Earl at Youghal:\r\na letter which may have been carried to Ireland in Frank’s pocket.\r\n\r\n“My most honoured Lord and Father, Having according to your Lordship’s\r\norder and directions seriously pondered and considered the present estate\r\nof our affairs, we have not thought it expedient for divers reasons that\r\nmy Brother will tell your Lordship by word of mouth that I should goe\r\ninto Holland; for besides that I am already weary and broken with a long\r\njourney of above eight hundred miles, I am as yet too weake to undertake\r\nso long a voyage in a strange country, where when I arrive I know nobody\r\nand have little hope by reason of my youth to be received among the\r\ntroops....” He explains that the money had not come; but M. Marcombes\r\nhad offered to keep him at Geneva till they should hear further from the\r\nEarl, “or till it pleased God to change the face of the affaires”; and\r\nRobyn had gratefully accepted this offer. He hoped to fit himself to\r\ndefend his religion, King, and country, “according to my little power....\r\n\r\n“... If your Lordship hath need of me in Ireland, I beseech your Lordship\r\nto acquaint me therewith and to believe that I have never beene taught to\r\nabandon my parents in adversity, but that there and in all other places I\r\nwill always strive to shew myself an obedient sonne....”\r\n\r\nFrank, he said, was ready to take horse to “goe towards Ireland, to\r\nsecoure your Lordship according to his power,” and would carry all their\r\nnews. And Robert ends his letter—\r\n\r\n“I most humbly take my leave, commending your Lordship and him and us all\r\nunto the protection of Almighty God, beseeching your Lordship to believe\r\nthat whatsoever misery or affliction it pleaseth God to send me I will\r\nnever doe the least action unworthy of the honor that I have to be, my\r\nLord, your Lordship’s most dutiful and obedient son, Robert Boyle.”[107]\r\n\r\nDr. Grosart, in editing the Lismore papers, found the original letter\r\nmuch damaged, a large piece of it having been torn away in the breaking\r\nof the seal. The Earl had evidently torn it open hastily in his anxiety\r\nto know what “my Robyn” was going to do. Whether or no Frank delivered\r\nthe letter into his father’s hands, Frank was certainly quickly back in\r\nIreland, and very much on the spot. By August 1 Robyn had received a\r\nletter from Frank, full of enthusiasm for Kynalmeaky’s conduct at home.\r\n\r\nFor Kynalmeaky was in his element at last. “I have left Sleeping in ye\r\nafternoone,” wrote Kynalmeaky to his old father in Youghal. The son who\r\nhad shown “all the faults a prodigall inordinate young man can have,\r\nwhich if he take not up in tyme will be his ruine and the breaking of my\r\nhart”, was redeeming himself. Kynalmeaky’s wife (the Earl of Cork always\r\ncalled her “my deare deare daughter-in-law”) had not been able to live\r\nwith her husband; even the younger brothers must long ago have known what\r\nKynalmeaky was. And now Frank had written to tell Robyn in Geneva that\r\nKynalmeaky was acting like a hero. And Robyn, so far away from home, had\r\nwritten off on August 1 a little letter of tender admiration to this\r\nelder brother, who had set them every bad example and yet had kept such a\r\nplace in their hearts. On the margin of this letter Robyn added a little\r\nboyish postscript—only to say he could not express in words what he was\r\nfeeling, and ending with “Adieu, Dearest Lewis, idle Cosin. Bon Anné, Bon\r\nSolé, bon Vespré. Adieue a Di vous commande.”\r\n\r\nDid Kynalmeaky ever have this letter? It was dated from Geneva, Aug. 1,\r\nand it was endorsed by the Earl of Cork himself, “from my sonn Robert\r\nto his brother Kynal. Rec. 13 Oct.” Had it been sent to the Earl, with\r\nKynalmeaky’s papers—or had it indeed come too late? For the battle of\r\nLiscarrol had been fought on Sept. 3. The Earl’s loyal son-in-law,\r\nLord Barrymore, and all the Earl’s sons except Robert, fought in that\r\nbattle.[108] And at the Battle of Liscarrol Kynalmeaky was killed;\r\nkilled on his horse, by a musket-shot through the head. It was Frank—the\r\n“sweet-spirited Frank,” fresh from the fencing and dancing and vaulting\r\nlessons in Geneva and Italy—who, “carrying himself with undaunted\r\nresolution,” rescued his brother’s body and horse, and kept troop and\r\nfoot together.\r\n\r\nThe old man did not know then which of these two sons to be proudest\r\nof. It was a grim satisfaction to the Earl, after all that had passed,\r\nwhen “Kynal” had been buried in Lismore Church, to sit down and make\r\nthat entry in his diary: “Six of the rebell ensignes were carried to his\r\nwiddoe.”[109]\r\n\r\nRobyn was to hear from his father once or twice after that. The Earl held\r\nout brave hopes of being able to procure some “office” for his boy “at\r\nhis coming over.” And he sent his own “choice dun mare” to Lismore, with\r\norders that it was to be “kept and drest carefully” for Robyn, when God\r\nshould send him home again. And when Broghill’s wife, “Lady Pegg,” was at\r\nlast obliged to return to England, the old Earl gave her a commission to\r\nbuy for him a ring “besett rownd with diamonds,” and to present it, from\r\nhim, to her fair young cousin the little Lady Ann Howard, whom he thought\r\nof always, even in those dark days, as “my Robyn’s yonge Mrs.”\r\n\r\nThere is something Shakespearean in the mood in which this old fighter\r\nlived his last months and drew his last breath. Shut up in Youghal,\r\n“preserving” that town for his King, his sons away fighting, his\r\ndaughters and grandchildren scattered, Kynalmeaky and Barrymore dead,\r\nand poor Lettice dying,[110] his lands despoiled, his fortune vanished,\r\nhe was still the great Earl of Cork, the head of a great family, the\r\nold man of action and experience, the Elizabethan soldier-statesman to\r\nwhom the younger men, statesmen and kinsmen alike, turned in this hour\r\nof extremity, and not in vain. There is nothing stronger or more human\r\nof its kind, or more characteristic of the man, than the positively last\r\nwill and testament made by himself in Youghal so late as November 1642,\r\nten months before his death.[111]\r\n\r\nThe end came, nobody knows exactly when, but about the very time of the\r\nsigning of the truce at Sigginstown, in the middle of September 1643,\r\n“from infirmities incident to old age, and the want of rest and quiet.”\r\n\r\nHe was buried in the great tomb at Youghal. All his life he had believed\r\nin three things: in God’s Providence, his own integrity of purpose, and\r\nthe righteousness of a Cause. And in the debacle—in his and Ireland’s\r\ndarkest moment, when the clouds hung low over his native land and the\r\nland of his adoption—his belief in these three things remained unmoved.\r\n\r\nShakespeare has told us how Faith and Uncertainty go hand in hand—\r\n\r\n“If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now: if\r\nit be not now, yet it will come....”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nIN ENGLAND AGAIN\r\n\r\n    “And though his boiling youth did often very earnestly\r\n    solicit to be employed in those culpable delights that are\r\n    useful[112] in and seem so proper for that season, and have\r\n    repentance adjourned till old age, yet did its importunities\r\n    meet ever with denials, Philaretus ever esteeming that piety\r\n    was to be embraced not so much to gain heaven, as to serve God\r\n    with....”—ROBERT BOYLE’S _Philaretus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1644, a slim, sunburnt, foreign-looking youth came back\r\ninto the London he had left when he was quite a little fellow, nearly\r\nfive years before. Even now, he was not yet eighteen, and he was still an\r\n“Eale”. None of his family expected his return; he had little or no money\r\nin his purse, and but vague ideas as to what he was going to do next.\r\n\r\nHow things had changed! Where were the King and Queen, whose hands Frank\r\nand he had kissed? And the gay Court that had clustered about them? And\r\nhis Father! There was no “Great Earl of Cork” any more; no “greatest\r\nfamily in all London,” living “extraordinarily high,” in the House of\r\nthe Savoy; no child weddings in the royal chapel at Whitehall. What had\r\nbecome of Frank’s wedding shoes, that had been lent afterwards to poor\r\nKynalmeaky?\r\n\r\nThere can have been little but troops, and talk of troops, on the dusty\r\nsummer roads, as Robert Boyle came towards London; and the quick, hot\r\njargon of names and phrases that was in all men’s mouths—the political\r\nidiom of the moment—must have been doubly difficult to understand by the\r\nboy who had so long been living in studious exile, speaking “all and\r\nallwayes French,” and breathing an atmosphere of profound peace—“the\r\nstorme having been driving another way.”\r\n\r\nAs he neared London, Robyn’s thoughts must have been still with the\r\nMarcombes household, till so recently his home, and the little circle of\r\nlearned and pleasant Genevan friends whom he had left behind him. For\r\nMarcombes had more than fulfilled his trust. No remittances had come to\r\nRobert Boyle since the old Earl wrote that letter to Marcombes in March\r\n1642. The boy had been running up a big debt, of money and gratitude\r\nalike, to his governour: “As for me,” he had written to his brother\r\nKynalmeaky about Marcombes (the old letter is scarcely decipherable\r\nin parts), “he hath so much obliged me the ... despaire of ever being\r\nable to desingage myselfe of so many and so greate ... that I have unto\r\nhim.”[113]\r\n\r\nAnd when at last, eight or nine months after the Earl’s death, Robyn,\r\nchafing in his idleness and exile, made up his mind to break from his\r\nsurroundings and find his way home somehow, Marcombes had used his own\r\ninterest in Geneva to “take up” for his pupil “some slight jewels at a\r\nreasonable rate,” by the sale of which, from place to place, the boy\r\nmight pay his way back to London.\r\n\r\nAnd now he was there; and the life of the little Swiss University town\r\nlay behind him, too recent to be forgotten: the life of a “well-fortified\r\ncity,” with the great Gothic fabric of a Cathedral in its midst, on\r\none of whose four cannon-mounted turrets there stood “a continual\r\nSentinel.” It was a Cathedral, of course, no longer. It was there that\r\nthe celebrated Dr. John Diodati, and the brilliant young Professor\r\nMorice better known as Alexander Morus, “poet and chief professor of the\r\nUniversity,” discoursed eloquently after the discipline of Calvin and\r\nBeza.[114] Dr. Diodati preached on Thursdays in Italian to his Italian\r\nProtestant Congregation, and on Sundays in French, with his hat on,\r\nafter the “French mode.” Dr. Diodati lived at the Villa Diodati, on the\r\nsouth bank of the lake, two miles out of the city: the old Bishop’s\r\nPalace was now the prison. The University was a “faire structure,”\r\nwith its class-rooms, its hall, and its excellent library. And Divines\r\nand Professors, in their gowns and caps and hats, flitted about the\r\nwooden-arcaded streets. There was an “aboundance of bookesellers”; and\r\ngood screwed guns and Geneva watches, pewter and cutlery, were to be\r\nbought; and amongst the hoary relics of Julius Cæsar and a pagan Rome\r\nthere stood the Town Hall, with the Cross Keys, and the City Motto: _Post\r\nTenebras Lux_.[115]\r\n\r\nThe only _Campus Martius_ that Robyn had ever known had been the fields\r\noutside Geneva, where every Sunday after the evening devotions the young\r\ntownsmen were allowed to exercise their arms, practising diligently with\r\nthe gun and the long and cross bows, for prizes of pewter plates and\r\ndishes. Robert Boyle had brought his bows and arrows back with him to\r\nLondon. He must have practised with the rest, as John Evelyn did two\r\nyears later, on that peaceful _Champs de Mars_, and played with the\r\nrest on its “noble Pall Mall.” He had known the gardens of rare tulips\r\nand other choice flowers outside the earthen fortifications, and he\r\nmust have seen Geneva also in its sterner moods. For that same “Mars’\r\nField” was the place of public execution; and in Geneva there was then\r\nno hospitality of extradition-law. Capital crime in other countries was\r\ncapital crime there. Fugitives from other countries were put to death in\r\nthe sunshine of that spacious field; and for the Genevans, by Genevan\r\nlaw, adultery was death.[116]\r\n\r\nBut Geneva and its Mars’ Field lay behind him. And in front? Robert Boyle\r\nmust have heard something of what had been happening at home. Accounts\r\nhad reached him from time to time of the “dreadful confusion of affairs”\r\nin England, Ireland and Scotland. During those last two years in Geneva\r\nhe must have heard all kinds of rumours of the struggle that was going\r\non between the Parliament and the Crown, between the Prelates and the\r\nPresbyterians. His friends in Geneva must have talked of the Solemn\r\nLeague and Covenant, and the Great Assembly of Divines that was meeting\r\nin Westminster; and of Archbishop Laud, then still alive, still in\r\nprison, his trial still deferred.\r\n\r\nBut it takes seeing to realise civil war. When Robyn arrived in England\r\nit was to find a kingdom in arms against itself, a nation divided into\r\ntwo great opposing armies; husbands and wives taking different sides,\r\nfathers and sons in opposite camps, brother against brother. The king’s\r\nheadquarters were at Oxford; Prince Rupert with his Royalist army was in\r\nLancashire. York was defended by the Marquis of Newcastle against the\r\ncombined Parliamentarian forces under Manchester, Fairfax and Cromwell.\r\nRobert Boyle had arrived in England almost on the eve of the battle of\r\nMarston Moor.\r\n\r\nAnd what to do? There was only one thing at this moment that the great\r\nEarl’s Benjamin could think of doing. He was no soldier, this dreamy\r\nyouth, with his books and his bows and arrows; but force of heredity—a\r\nkind of force of inertia—would have carried him into the Royalist camp.\r\nHis brothers were all soldiers; though it is doubtful if he knew, when he\r\ncame home, where they were and what they were doing. The very politics\r\nof the various members of this scattered family, the “sides” they were\r\ntaking in the quick march of political events, must have been a puzzle\r\nto him. And so it was Robert Boyle’s intention to join the army, where\r\nhe told himself he would find, besides his brothers, “the excellent King\r\nhimself, divers eminent divines, and many worthy persons of several\r\nranks.” But he knew also that “the generality of those he would have\r\nbeen obliged to converse with were very debauched, and apt, as well as\r\ninclinable, to make others so.”\r\n\r\nIf Robert Boyle had joined the King’s army! It is difficult to think\r\nof him in “armor of prooff,” and quite impossible to picture him as a\r\nlaughing Cavalier. He disliked “customary swearing”; he drank water; he\r\ndid not smoke; he dearly loved to point a moral; and he never adorned\r\na tale. It is certain no officers’ mess would have endured him for\r\nten minutes, in the rôle either of sceptical chymist or of Christian\r\nvirtuoso. And what would have become of the Invisible College, and the\r\nRoyal Society?\r\n\r\nBut, fortunately for them, for him, and for posterity, it was to be\r\nordered otherwise. It happened that his sister Katherine, now, since the\r\ndeath of her father-in-law,[117] Lady Ranelagh, was in the summer of 1644\r\nactually living in London, and “it was by an accident” that Robyn found\r\nher out; an accident to which he used afterwards to ascribe “a good part\r\nof his future happiness.”\r\n\r\nIn later years, when Robert Boyle was giving Bishop Burnet some of the\r\nfacts of his life for an intended biography, he did not mention what the\r\n“accident” was. Perhaps, so soon after the Restoration, he had still\r\nreason to be discreet in the use of names; for Lady Ranelagh, in the\r\nsummer of 1644, was very much among the Parliamentarians.\r\n\r\nIn the light of after events, one or two possibilities suggest\r\nthemselves, if it be forgivable in anything concerning an experimental\r\nchemist to indulge in speculation. Marcombes must surely have furnished\r\nRobyn with letters to persons in London who would be of practical help\r\nto the boy on his arrival. Who were they? Mr. Perkins the tailor had\r\nproved perfidious, and was out of the question. There were Peter Naylor,\r\nthe lawyer-cousin in New Inn, and Cousin Croone of the Nag’s Head, and\r\nPhilip Burlamachy, once Lord Mayor, with whom the old Earl had done so\r\nmuch business, and who was also a relation of the Diodati family, Dr.\r\nJohn Diodati’s wife being a Burlamachy. But it could scarcely be called\r\nan accident if in a business call on any of these Robyn had obtained his\r\nsister’s address. It must have been some chance meeting with, or news of,\r\nher in some unexpected quarter.\r\n\r\nOther men there were to whom the boy may well have carried letters from\r\nMarcombes or his Genevan friends. There was Dr. Theodore Diodati, the\r\nLondon physician—brother of Dr. John in Geneva,—who knew a great many\r\npeople in London; and there was Samuel Hartlib, the naturalised German,\r\nthe merchant-philanthropist who knew everybody and whom everybody knew.\r\nAnd there was Milton himself, a friend of the Diodati family in Geneva,\r\nand a friend also of Dr. Theodore Diodati and Mr. Hartlib. Dr. Theodore\r\nDiodati lived in the parish of St. Bartholomew the Less, not far from\r\nMilton’s house in Aldersgate Street, and Hartlib was living in Duke’s\r\nPlace, Aldgate. He was a man with many hobbies and interests, and a large\r\ncorrespondence. He conducted, in fact, “a general news agency,” and must\r\nhave been as well known in Geneva as in London from his connexion with\r\nDurie and the great project of a union of all the Protestant Churches\r\nof Europe, and for his friendship with Comenius, and his active part\r\nin the scheme which the English Parliament was then itself taking up\r\nof a reform, on Baconian lines, of the English Universities and Public\r\nSchools. It is certain that Hartlib was one of Robert Boyle’s earliest\r\nfriends in London; that Hartlib and Milton were intimate, and that Milton\r\nhad first addressed his _Tract on Education_ to Hartlib. And it is\r\ndifficult to believe that Milton was unknown—by name at least—to Robert\r\nBoyle. For Milton had been in Geneva in the summer of 1639, just before\r\nFrank and Robyn went there. Milton’s great friend Charles Diodati was the\r\nson of Dr. Theodore in London and the nephew of Dr. John of Geneva; and\r\nwhen Milton passed through Geneva on his way home from his Italian tour\r\nDr. John had been very hospitable to him. Milton had been an honoured\r\nguest at the Villa Diodati, and it is supposed that he heard there the\r\nnews of Charles Diodati’s death. Even if Robyn had not met Milton at Sir\r\nHenry Wotton’s table when Milton dined at Eton, he may well have heard\r\nin Geneva all about Charles Diodati and John Milton, and the _Epitaphium\r\nDamonis_—the Latin poem that Milton wrote on his return home, in memory\r\nof his dead friend. And it is probable he knew of _Comus_, acted by the\r\nBridgewater family, and of _Lycidas_ also, and Milton’s friendship for\r\nEdward King, the brilliant young Irishman, whose relatives in Ireland\r\nmust have been well known to the Boyle family. Robyn may well have read\r\nthe _Epitaphium Damonis_ in the Villa Diodati; and in the house of the\r\nItalian teacher and refugee, Count Cerdogni, he may have looked through\r\nthe famous autograph album in which Milton had written the words (of\r\nwhich Robyn would certainly have approved)—\r\n\r\n    “If Vertue feeble were,\r\n    Heaven itself would stoop to her.”\r\n\r\nIt is not so certain that Milton’s prose would have pleased the boy;—the\r\nchurch-politics, the anti-episcopal pamphlets, and the divorce tract that\r\nhad recently been the topic of conversation in London. There is no trace\r\nof a personal friendship between Milton and Robert Boyle. Their paths\r\nconstantly crossed, but they were to walk apart. Boyle deplored religious\r\ncontroversy, and did not sympathise with the sects and sectaries. And\r\nyet it is here that the possibility of the “accident” comes in. For Lady\r\nRanelagh was a very progressive Puritan, whose interests were already\r\nbound up with the Parliamentarian Party and its reforms. She must have\r\nknown Milton well personally or by reputation at this time, and she can\r\nhave had no bad opinion of him or his prose-writings, or she would not\r\nhave sent, as she did, her own nephew, young Lord Barrymore, to be one of\r\nMilton’s pupils. Barrymore, only four years younger than Robert Boyle,\r\nwas one of Milton’s resident pupils when, in September 1645, Milton\r\nremoved from Aldersgate Street into a larger house in Barbican with the\r\npurpose of being able to board a larger number of boys. Lady Ranelagh\r\nwas later on to send her own boy, Dick Jones, to be taught by Milton;\r\nher friendship for Milton was to endure through many troublous years;\r\nin his own words she stood “in place of all kith and kin”[118] to him\r\nin his blindness and solitude; and her good offices seem not to have\r\nstopped even there. May it have been through this Diodati-Milton-Hartlib\r\nconnexion that Robert Boyle and his sister Ranelagh were brought together?\r\n\r\nBut London was not so large a place in 1644. Cousin Croone was presumably\r\nstill at the Nag’s Head in Cheapside, and people met in Cheapside in\r\nthose days. Had not Dr. John Diodati himself, on his one visit to London\r\nin 1627, run up against the very man he most wanted to meet—Mr. Bedell,\r\nafterwards the Bishop—in Cheapside? Whatever the “accident” was, Lady\r\nRanelagh received her young brother with open arms. Her address in that\r\nsummer of 1644 still remains uncertain, though not long afterwards she\r\nseems to have been living in the house in the Old Mall which was to be\r\nher home to the end of her life.[119] It may have been in Pall Mall that\r\nRobyn came knocking at his sister’s door. Lord Ranelagh—he had taken his\r\nseat in the House of Peers in February 1644—was probably in Ireland, for\r\nthere is no mention of him as one of the family circle at this time;\r\nand the husband and wife, as the years went on, had lived more and more\r\napart. Lord Ranelagh, who had run through his own and his wife’s money,\r\nlived in Ireland, and Lady Ranelagh in London. She was in the receipt,\r\nfor some reason unexplained, of a pension from Government of £4 a week,\r\nand was otherwise helped by the members of her own family.\r\n\r\nFor nearly five months, Robert Boyle lived with his sister and her young\r\nchildren,[120] and a strongly Parliamentarian sister-in-law—wife of a\r\nmember of the House of Commons.[121] And Mary, “my Lady Molkin,” as Robyn\r\ncalls her, now Charles Rich’s wife, and daughter-in-law of the great Earl\r\nof Warwick, was not far off, whether at Warwick House in Holborn, or at\r\n“delicious Leeze” in Essex. Mary had had her troubles, since her romantic\r\nmarriage three years before. She had lost her first baby, a little girl,\r\nwhen it was “one year and a quarter old,”[122] and her second child, a\r\nboy, had been born just at the dark time of the old Earl’s death. Charles\r\nRich had kept back the bad news till his young wife was “up again.”[123]\r\n\r\nIn his sister’s house, Robert Boyle found himself in the very thick\r\nof the Parliamentarian interests. She was still a young woman—only\r\nthirty—and a very clever woman, highly educated for her time, and popular\r\nby reason of her “universal affability.” In her house, Robyn came to\r\nknow, as real friends, “some of the great men of that Party, which\r\nwas then growing, and soon after victorious.”[124] Her house was, in\r\nfact, even then, a rendezvous of the Parliamentarian Party. And what a\r\nvehemently interesting time it was, in London! Both Houses were sitting:\r\nthe Westminster Assembly was busy with the new Directory of Worship and\r\nthe new frame of Church Government. In September, Essex was beaten by\r\nthe King’s forces in Cornwall; and Manchester and Cromwell were back in\r\nLondon from the north. During the last weeks of Robert Boyle’s sojourn\r\nunder his sister’s roof, the talk must have been all of, if not with,\r\nManchester and Cromwell, and of Cromwell’s “Toleration Order” and the\r\nabolition of the use of the Prayer Book. In October the King was moving\r\nback to Oxford, and there was fought the second battle of Newbury. And\r\nnow the thoughts of the Parliament men were veering round from Church\r\nGovernment to Army Reform; and towards the end of that year, the talk was\r\nof Cromwell’s “Self-denying Ordinance” and the great changes it would\r\ncarry with it; and of the new modelling of the Army—the “new noddle”\r\nas the scoffers called it. And all the time Hartlib, in Aldgate, was\r\nimmersed in his social and educational schemes; and Milton, in Aldersgate\r\nStreet, was teaching his boys and writing his second divorce tract and\r\nhis _Areopagitica_; and all the time Laud was lying in the Tower, his\r\ntrial dragging wearily on. What did Robert Boyle think of it all after\r\nthe profound peace of Geneva?\r\n\r\nWhatever was in his thoughts at this time—and it is very certain Robert\r\nBoyle had no intention of giving up the Book of Common Prayer, or any\r\nbook he might wish to keep—there was no more talk of joining the King’s\r\nArmy; and when at last, towards the end of the year, the state of the\r\nroads south-west of London permitted it, it was under a Parliamentarian\r\nescort that the young Squire found his way into Dorsetshire, to take\r\npossession of his own Manor of Stalbridge. Through his sister’s influence\r\nwith her Parliamentarian friends, Robyn had got “early protection for his\r\nEnglish and Irish estates.”\r\n\r\nEven with this protection, there were difficulties in front of him.\r\nThere must have been a sadness about his solitary return to the Manor,\r\nempty except for the child-memories of five years before. The fair\r\nchimney-pieces and carved balustrades, the beautiful rose-coloured\r\nfurniture “hastened home” for those great house-parties of 1639—must have\r\ntalked to him of a chapter of his life wiped out for ever. What things\r\nhad happened there! There was the arrival of Mary’s suitor, and Mary’s\r\nhigh averseness and contradiction, and the young man’s discomfiture and\r\ndeparture to the Bath: Mary was the same imperious little woman now,\r\nas then; she now had a “high averseness” to Charles Rich’s “engaging\r\nin the wars.” Here poor Lettice had drooped and complained, and George\r\nGoring, with his wounded leg, had limped up and down stairs. Then\r\nthere was the “private discourse” in the Stalbridge parlour, that had\r\nsettled poor Frank’s fate: Betty had refused to live with the old\r\nEarl after Mary’s marriage, and had gone her own way; she was now,\r\nnominally with the Staffords, at The Hague, the gay little courtier\r\nthat she was, a Killigrew all over!... There were the paths where Mr.\r\nDowch had discoursed Latin Syntax, and where Robyn had first come to\r\nknow the cheerful and choleric Marcombes, as they talked in “familiar\r\nFrench” about all the European cities they were going to see. Through\r\nthese gates Frank and Robyn had come “home” after the years at Eton—the\r\n“blew-perpetuana” curtains following duly. Through these gates, he and\r\nFrank and Marcombes had passed, on that memorable journey to London,\r\nwhere Frank was to “make his addresses” to Betty in the Savoy. All round\r\nhim lay the fields where he had dreamed, and the orchards of which he had\r\nbeen so proud to possess the keys. And it was all his own, now—all empty\r\nand neglected: “my own ruined cottage in the country”:[125] a depressing\r\nplace for a boy of eighteen to return alone to. One of the first events\r\nof the new year, 1645, the news of which could have reached Stalbridge\r\nwas the execution of Laud on Tower Hill.\r\n\r\nNobody could have been very glad to see Robert Boyle come back again;\r\nleast of all Tom Murray, whom the old Earl had left in charge, and who\r\nproved himself to have been, during his reign there, as untrustworthy as\r\nMr. Perkins the London tailor. “The roguery of Tom Murray” was one of\r\nthe first difficulties that faced the young squire.\r\n\r\nTwo other pieces of business, however, could have admitted of no delay.\r\nMarcombes was to be repaid; and partly to that end, apparently, in\r\nAugust 1645, as soon as Robert Boyle could put his hands on some of his\r\nown money, he set out from Stalbridge, “the necessities of my affairs,”\r\nas he explained in a letter to his brother Broghill, “calling me away\r\n(according to the leave the Parliament has given me) into France.”[126]\r\nBy August 1645, the New Model had done extraordinary things. In the\r\nspring, Cromwell and Waller had been in the west of England. Naseby had\r\nbeen fought in June, and the King’s private correspondence taken and\r\npublished. In July, George Goring had been badly beaten in the west;\r\nBath had surrendered on July 30. Was Robert Boyle still at Stalbridge\r\non August 15, when Sherborne Castle was stormed and battered—Sherborne\r\nCastle, where the old Earl and his sons had killed that buck and dined\r\nthe very day that Lady Ranelagh’s baby had been born? Probably not. It\r\nwas probably wise that he should absent himself, “according to the leave\r\nthe Parliament had given him.” At any rate, he was well away from English\r\nshores again when on September 10 there came “the splendid success of the\r\nstorming of Bristol.”[127]\r\n\r\nIt is not known if Robert Boyle went so far as Geneva, or whether he\r\nactually saw his old governour again; but in any case his visit was a\r\nbrief one. His business was done, and he was back in London before the\r\nend of that year, staying with Lady Ranelagh, and able to attend to the\r\nother business that remained to be done—if indeed it had not been done\r\nbefore he left Stalbridge in August.\r\n\r\nThere were, it will be remembered, certain deeds in a sealed box left by\r\nthe old Earl in the hands of Mr. Peter Naylor of New Inn. But they were\r\nduplicates. The originals had been left with Lord Howard of Escrick, the\r\nfather of “My Robyn’s yonge Mrs.” and the uncle of Broghill’s wife, Lady\r\nPegg. They embodied the old Earl’s last effort in family match-making;\r\na fitting match for the youngest son of the great Earl of Cork, which\r\nwould further unite the families of Cecil, Howard, and Boyle; already\r\nintermarried, as Broghill’s wife was a niece of Lord Edward Howard, Lady\r\nSalisbury his sister, and Lady Dungarvan’s mother a Cecil. The old Earl\r\nhad done his very best for his Benjamin. And it is a mistake to suppose\r\nit probable that the children had never met. They may very well have made\r\nshy advances to one another during those weeks in the autumn of 1639\r\nwhen Frank and Robyn were in London, just before Frank’s wedding. The\r\nHouse of the Savoy and Salisbury House were very near each other; the\r\nfamilies were often together; and little Ann Howard—her mother dead—was\r\noften with Lady Salisbury. The two children may even have made a pretty\r\nand much-admired pair at Frank’s wedding in Whitehall, and hence may\r\nhave come the old Earl’s confident “My Robyn’s yonge Mrs.” But there it\r\nhad ended: the children, if they met then, had never seen each other\r\nsince; and in five years they had both grown up. It was in 1642 that the\r\nold Earl commissioned Lady Pegg to carry to her little cousin the ring\r\n“besett rownd with diamonds”; but now it was 1645, and many things had\r\nhappened. The vast Irish estates had been devastated in the Rebellion.\r\nDorsetshire had been scourged by civil war; and Robyn had come back\r\npenniless and foreign-looking from Geneva, and was returning to his\r\n“ruined cottage in the country” to examine and administer his disordered\r\naffairs as best he could.\r\n\r\nA boy of eighteen, Robert Boyle had come back heart-whole. Evelyn has\r\nleft it on record that there were very few fair ladies in Geneva, when he\r\nand Captain Wray[128] and the poet Waller stopped there on their homeward\r\njourney, in 1646. “This towne,” wrote Evelyn, “is not much celebrated\r\nfor beautifull women, for even at this distance from the Alps the\r\ngentlewomen have something full throats; but our Captain Wray ... fell so\r\nmightily in love with one of Mons. Saladine’s[129] daughters that with\r\nmuch persuasion he could not be persuaded to think on his journey into\r\nFrance.” Robert Boyle had not fallen in love with any of M. Saladine’s\r\ndaughters; and his views on the subject of marriage would scarcely have\r\nbeen understood by Captain Wray. “Marriage,” wrote Robert Boyle from\r\nStalbridge when he was scarcely twenty, “is not a bare present, but a\r\nlegal exchange of hearts;—and the same contract that gives you right to\r\nanother’s, ties you to look upon your own as another’s goods, and too\r\nsurely made over to remain any longer in your gift.”\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, “my Robyn’s yonge Mrs.” had already come, by an even\r\nshorter process of reasoning, to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Ann Howard was a particular girl-friend of Anne Murray[130]—a\r\ndaughter of that Murray who had been Provost of Eton before Sir Henry\r\nWotton. Lady Ann Howard often stayed with the widowed Mrs. Murray and\r\nher daughter in their house in St. Martin’s Lane; and during the summer\r\nmonths of 1644 the two girls were constantly together at the house of\r\nAnne Murray’s elder sister, Lady Newton, at Charlton in Kent. It was\r\na house surrounded by a garden with quiet walks in it. Lord Howard of\r\nEscrick’s eldest son, brother of “My Robyn’s yonge Mrs.,” was often\r\nthere, for he was in love with Anne Murray; and Mr. Charles Howard—a\r\nyoung cousin of the Howards—was often there too, for he was in love with\r\nhis cousin, Lady Ann. Anne Murray has left a pretty description of the\r\nlove-making that went on in that garden. They called it _amour_ in those\r\ndays, and they were all ridiculously young. Lord Howard of Escrick,\r\nthe father, was a Parliamentarian, and at this time very busy as one\r\nof the ten Lords who were lay members of the Westminster Assembly; but\r\nhe was not too busy to come and fetch away his son and daughter when\r\nhe heard what was going on. The four young people had been very happy\r\nin that garden. Anne Murray has described how once Charles Howard took\r\nhis fair cousin by the hand, and “led her into another walke, and left\r\nhim and I together.” “Him” was Lord Howard of Escrick’s son and heir,\r\nwho straightway proposed to “I.” But Anne Murray was not allowed to say\r\n“yes”; her mother shut her up, and she was fed on bread and water. With\r\nthe Lady Ann and Charles Howard it was quite different. The boy-cousin\r\ncan have had no reason to conceal his feelings, unless indeed it were the\r\nprior claim of the absent Robyn. Charles Howard’s brilliant career may\r\nbe read in any _Peerage_. He was a soldier and a man of parts at sixteen.\r\nHe was to serve Cromwell and to become one of Cromwell’s Lords, and to\r\nbe created Earl of Carlisle at the coronation of Charles II. He was the\r\n“finest gentleman”; and he won his cousin Ann, who was “My Robyn’s yonge\r\nMrs.”\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle also seems to have acted his part as became “a very parfit\r\ngentle knight” and the old Earl’s Benjamin. There can be little doubt\r\nthat a passage in an undated letter from Lady Ranelagh to her brother\r\nbelongs to this period, and ends, for him, the episode. “You are now,”\r\nshe says, “very near the hour wherein your mistress is, by giving herself\r\nto another, to set you at liberty from all the appearances you have put\r\non of being a lover; which, though they cost you some pains and use of\r\nart, were easier, because they were but appearances.”[131]\r\n\r\nThe Howard cousins, Mr. Charles Howard and the Lady Ann, must have been\r\nmarried very shortly after, if not before, Robert Boyle returned from his\r\nflying visit to France at the end of 1645. The box of deeds left with\r\nLord Howard of Escrick must have come back into Robyn’s hands. The little\r\nlady was to pass out of his life almost before she can be said to have\r\nentered it. Twenty years afterwards the Lady Ann was still a young woman,\r\nthough she was the mother of grown-up children, when Mr. Pepys made the\r\nentry in his diary: “I to church: and in our pew there sat a great lady,\r\nwhom I afterwards understood to be my Lady Carlisle, a very fine woman\r\nindeed in person.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE DEARE SQUIRE\r\n\r\n    “... When a Navigator suddenly spies an unknown Vessel afar\r\n    off, before he has hail’d her, he can scarcely, if at all,\r\n    conclude what he shall learn by her, and he may from a Ship\r\n    that he finds perhaps on some remoter coast of _Africa_, or the\r\n    _Indies_, meet with Informations concerning his own Country\r\n    and affairs; And thus sometimes a little Flower may point us\r\n    to the Sun, and by casting our eyes down to our feet, we may\r\n    in the water see those Stars that shine in the Firmament or\r\n    highest visible Heaven.”—ROBERT BOYLE: _Occasional Reflections\r\n    on Several Subjects_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in March 1646 that Robert Boyle once more set out from London to\r\nride into Dorsetshire. The Manor of Stalbridge was to be his home for the\r\nnext five or six years.\r\n\r\nWhat fate had overtaken the Earl’s choice dun mare that waited at Lismore\r\nfor Robyn’s home-coming? The old order had changed; and it was on a\r\nborrowed courser, “none of the freest of his legs,” that Robert Boyle\r\nmade the journey. Lord Broghill was with him, and they had the company of\r\na States-Messenger, who was travelling the same way. The account of their\r\nlong ride, by Farnham and Winchester and over Salisbury Plain is a little\r\nromance in itself.[132] The war was drawing to an end. The King was again\r\nat Oxford:—it was not long before his escape, in disguise, to the Scots\r\nat Newcastle. The new-modelled Army had very nearly completed its work\r\nof conquest in the south-west. The Cavaliers were out between Egham and\r\nFarnham, but the travellers dodged them.[133] Farnham was deserted—“all\r\nthe townsmen having gone to oppose the King’s Army.” Robert Boyle almost\r\nlost himself in meditation, “invited by the coolness of the evening and\r\nthe freshness of the garden,” in which he walked up and down waiting for\r\nhis supper. The travellers supped, and retired quietly to bed; and it\r\nwas not till the dead of night that they were roused by a thundering at\r\nthe chamber door. Robyn slept in his clothes and stockings: “my usual\r\nnight-posture when I travel.” He produced his bilboa from under his\r\npillow, and a pistol from one of his holsters; his bows and arrows were\r\nnot far off. But it turned out to be only the town-constable with a group\r\nof musketeers, in search of somebody else. “Away went my gentleman,”\r\nwrote Robyn gaily to his sister, “in prosecution of his search; and I\r\neven took my bows and arrows and went to sleep.”\r\n\r\nThey dined next day at Winchester, and lay that night at Salisbury; and\r\nthere Robyn overtook his trunks, which had been sent on in front of\r\nhim. In the middle of Salisbury Plain they were surrounded by a party\r\nof horse, who would have searched them for “Malignant Letters” such as\r\n“use to be about the King’s Picture in a Yellow-Boy.”[134] But the\r\nStates-Messenger carried them safely through, and they rode on, past\r\nweary troops of foot, “poor pressed countrymen,” goaded on by the party\r\nof horse. “Amongst them,” wrote Robert Boyle, “I saw one poor rogue,\r\nlacqueyed by his wife, and carrying a child upon his shoulders.” Even\r\nthen, as now, “new models” leave much to be desired.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his bilboa and pistols, Robert Boyle hated the sight of war.\r\n“Good God!” he wrote, “that reasonable creatures, that call themselves\r\nChristians too, should delight in such an unnatural thing as war, where\r\ncruelty at least becomes necessity....”\r\n\r\nHe reached Stalbridge in safety; but the weather had broken, and was\r\nwretchedly cold. “We all suspect the almanac-maker of a mistake in\r\nsetting down March instead of January.” The bad weather kept him indoors,\r\nand was “so drooping that it dulls me to all kinds of useful study.”\r\nEven his country neighbours were prevented from making their usual\r\n“visitations.” Robert Boyle was depressed: Stalbridge was not so lively\r\nas London. “My stay here,” he says, “God willing, shall not be long.”\r\n\r\nThere were still troops in the neighbourhood, and the plague had\r\n“begun to revive again”; there had been cases at Bristol, and at\r\nYeovil, only six miles off. Dorsetshire was suffering from “fits of the\r\nCommittee”;[135] and at the Manor itself there were many calls on the\r\nSquire’s slender purse. This had for the time been replenished by one of\r\nhis brothers; and he was going to cut down some of his wood, to repay the\r\nloan. He was arranging to make “my brother’s sixty trees bear him some\r\ngolden fruit”; but this was to be done by instalments—one third at May\r\nDay next. And meantime he was trying to settle down to his “standish and\r\nbooks”; but even writing did not come easily. “My Ethics,” he wrote to\r\nhis sister (of a little treatise he had begun, one of his first literary\r\nattempts), “go very slowly on.”[136]\r\n\r\nAnd the days must have passed slowly too. “I am grown so perfect a\r\nvillager, and live so removed,” runs a letter to Lady Ranelagh, “not\r\nonly from the roads, but from the very by-paths of intelligence, that to\r\nentertain you with our country discourse, would have extremely puzzled\r\nme, since your children have not the rickets nor the measles.”[137] He\r\nwas feeling the difficulties of his position, in being one of a family\r\nso important to both political parties. “I have been forced to observe\r\na very great caution and exact evenness in my carriage, since I saw you\r\nlast,” he wrote to Marcombes in Geneva; “it being absolutely necessary\r\nfor the preservation of a person whom the unfortunate situation of his\r\nfortune made obnoxious to the injuries of both parties and the protection\r\nof neither.” And his money matters were still in disorder, as indeed were\r\neverybody else’s. Out of his Irish estates he had not received “the worth\r\nof a farthing.”\r\n\r\nThe roguery of Tom Murray at Stalbridge, however, had had one good\r\nresult: it had obliged Robyn to make “further discoveries into æconomical\r\nknowledge” than he would otherwise have done. He had turned Tom Murray\r\naway, “to let him know that I could do my business very well without\r\nhim”; and then, towards the end of 1646, Tom Murray was to be taken\r\nback: “Having attained to a knowledge of my own small fortune beyond\r\nthe possibility of being cheated, I am likely to make use of him again,\r\nto show my father’s servants that I wish no hurt to the man, but to the\r\nknave.”\r\n\r\nIn October 1646, Robert Boyle was back on a visit to London, perhaps to\r\nsee the great Essex buried “in kingly state.” On that day, the solemn\r\npageant just over, he sat down to write a letter—a wonderful letter\r\nfor a boy not yet twenty—to Marcombes in Geneva. He wrote of the long\r\nprocession of four hundred officers, “not one so low as a captain,” the\r\nHouse of Peers, the House of Commons, the City-Fathers, and the Assembly\r\nof Divines, that had followed Essex to the grave. But to Robert Boyle the\r\n“pageants of sorrow” had “eaten up the reality”; the “care of the blaze”\r\nhad “diverted men from mourning.”[138]\r\n\r\nHis letter to his old governour gives a vivid picture of the political\r\nconditions of the time. In England there was “not one Malignant garrison\r\nuntaken”; in Wales “but two or three rocky places held out for the\r\nKing.” The Scots were about to deliver up their garrisons and return\r\ninto their own country, the Parliament having agreed to compound with\r\nthem for all their arrears. A sum of £300,000 had been agreed upon, but\r\n“the first payment is yet in debate.” The King was still at Newcastle,\r\n“both discontenting and discontented”; and the Scots would be obliged\r\nto make up their minds how to “dispose of his person,” which the Houses\r\nhad “voted to remain in the disposition of both Houses of Parliament.”\r\nPeople were flattering themselves with hopes of a speedy settlement of\r\nthings, but Robert Boyle was not so hopeful. He has, he says, “always\r\nlooked upon Sin as the chief incendiary of this war”; and yet, “by\r\ncareful experience,” he has observed that the war has “only multiplied\r\nand heightened those sins to which it owes its being.” And his simile\r\nis characteristic: “As water and ice,” he adds, “which by a reciprocal\r\ngeneration beget one another.”\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the state of things was no more hopeful than nearer home. The\r\nnews of Lord Ormonde’s peace must have reached Geneva; but Robert Boyle\r\nexplains carefully to Marcombes the respective attitudes of the three\r\nparties;—the Protestant English proper; the “mere natives,” who hoped by\r\nrebellion “to exchange the Throne of England for St. Peter’s Chair,” or\r\n“to shake off the English yoke for that of some Catholic foreign prince”;\r\nand, thirdly, the Catholic Lords of the English Pale—“so we call the\r\ncounties about Dublin”—who are “by manners and inclination Irish, though\r\nEnglish by descent.”\r\n\r\nIn Inchiquin’s absence from Munster, Broghill, Governor of Youghal,\r\nhad been left in full command.[139] Robyn is very proud of Broghill,\r\nnot only as a gallant soldier, but as “none of the least wits of the\r\ntime.” Broghill had come to England to appeal for troops and supplies\r\nfor Munster;[140] but Parliament was so slow in granting them that “the\r\nphysic will not get thither before the patient be dead.”\r\n\r\nAnd then Robert Boyle gives Marcombes a piece of his mind about the sects\r\nand sectaries:—\r\n\r\n“The Presbyterian Government is at last settled (though I can scarce\r\nthink it will prove long lived) after the great opposition of many, and\r\nto their no less dislike.” But many people had begun to think it was high\r\ntime to “put a restraint upon the spreading impostures of the sectaries,”\r\nwho had made London their general rendezvous. The City “entertains at\r\npresent no less than 200 several opinions in point of religion.” Some\r\nhave been “digged out of the graves,” where they had been long condemned\r\nto lie buried; others have been “newly fashioned in the forge of their\r\nown brains”; most are but “new editions of old errors.”\r\n\r\n“If the truth be anywhere to be found,” wrote the young philosopher, “it\r\nis here sought so many several ways that one or other must needs light\r\nupon it.” But he speaks with respect of that kind of tolerance that tries\r\nto see even in impostures “glimpses and manifestations of obscure or\r\nformerly concealed truths,” and that would not “aggravate very venial\r\nerrors into dangerous and damnable heresies.”\r\n\r\n“The Parliament is now upon an ordinance for the punishment of many of\r\nthese supposed errors; but since their belief of their contrary truths\r\nis confessedly a work of divine revelation, why a man should be hanged\r\nbecause it has not yet pleased God to give him his Spirit, I confess I\r\nam yet to understand....”\r\n\r\nAfter this the letter goes off into domestic and personal matters.\r\nRobert Boyle had been in company with the Archbishop of Armagh[141]—“our\r\nIrish St. Austin”[142]—and had been telling him of Marcombes’s French\r\ntranslation of a sermon of the Archbishop’s, “The Mystery of the\r\nIncarnation.” “He seemed very willing that you should publish it, upon\r\nthe assurance I gave him of the fidelity of its translation.” Lady\r\nRanelagh and Broghill were anxious to find Marcombes some more pupils;\r\nbut all the great families of England were at present “standing at a\r\ngaze.” Whether peace or war be the outcome of events, “it is probable\r\nthat a good many of them will make visits to foreign climates.”[143]\r\n\r\nRobyn himself had seen a variety of fortune since he and his governour\r\nhad parted: “plenty and want, danger and safety, sickness and health,\r\ntrouble and ease.” He had actually once been a prisoner in London, “on\r\nsome groundless suspicion,” but had quickly got off with advantage. At\r\nStalbridge he was pursuing his studies by fits and starts. “Divers little\r\nessays, both in prose and verse, I have taken the pains to scribble\r\nupon several subjects”; and as soon as he can “lick them into some less\r\nimperfect shape” he will send some of the “least bad” to Marcombes in\r\nGeneva. He tells Marcombes about his study of ethics, and his desire to\r\n“call them down from the brain into the breast, and from the school to\r\nthe house”; and he mentions his little treatise that goes on so slowly.\r\n\r\n“The other humane studies I apply myself to are natural philosophy,\r\nthe mechanics, and husbandry, according to the principles of our new\r\nphilosophical college, that values no knowledge but as it hath a tendency\r\nto use.” And he begs Marcombes to inquire for him into the “ways of\r\nhusbandry” practised about Geneva; “and when you intend for England, to\r\nbring along with you what good receipts or good books of any of those\r\nsubjects you can procure, which will make you extremely welcome to our\r\n_invisible college_.”\r\n\r\nThe “Invisible College,” the embryo of the Royal Society of London,\r\nwas then already in existence. Since some time in 1645, a little club\r\ncomposed of a few “worthy persons inquisitive into natural philosophy”\r\nhad been holding its weekly meetings; sometimes in the lodging of the\r\nphysician, Dr. Jonathan Goddard, in Wood Street, Cheapside; sometimes\r\nat a “convenient place” in Cheapside itself,—in fact, the Bull’s Head\r\nTavern; and sometimes in Gresham College, near by. Its originator\r\nwas Theodore Haak, who, like Hartlib, was a naturalised German; and\r\namong its first members were Dr. John Wallis, clerk to the Westminster\r\nAssembly; Dr. Wilkins, afterwards Warden of Wadham College, Oxford, and\r\nbrother-in-law of Oliver Cromwell; Foster, the professor of astronomy at\r\nGresham College; the young William Petty; Dr. Goddard himself; and one\r\nor two other “doctors in physic” more or less well known in London. They\r\nhad their telescopes and microscopes and their attendant apothecaries,\r\netc.; and, “precluding theology and state-affairs,” they wandered at\r\nwill among the sciences,—the physics and chemics, and mechanics and\r\nmagnetics,—“as then cultivated at home and abroad.” Hartlib was from\r\nthe very first connected with this club: “The Invisible College of his\r\nimagination seems to have been that enlarged future association of all\r\nearnest spirits for the prosecution of real and fruitful knowledge of\r\nwhich this club might be the symbol and promise.”[144]\r\n\r\nHis early letters to Robert Boyle at Stalbridge are full of the subjects\r\nunder discussion. And there is no doubt that it was to a great extent\r\nthe fascination of these weekly meetings in Wood Street, and the company\r\nhe met there, that drew Robert Boyle so often to London and kept him in\r\nLondon as long as he could manage to stay there.\r\n\r\n“I have been every day these two months,” he wrote to his friend Francis\r\nTallents, in February 1647,[145] “upon visiting my own ruined cottage\r\nin the country; but it is such a labyrinth, this London, that all my\r\ndiligence could never yet find a way out on’t ... the best on’t is, that\r\nthe corner-stones of the _invisible_, or as they term themselves, the\r\n_philosophical college_, do now and then honour me with their company\r\n... men of so capacious and searching spirits, that school-philosophy is\r\nbut the lowest region of their knowledge; and yet, though ambitious to\r\nlead the way to any generous design, of so humble and tractable a genius,\r\nas they disdain not to be directed to the meanest, so he can but plead\r\nreason for his opinion; persons that endeavour to put narrow-mindedness\r\nout of countenance by the practice of so extensive a charity that it\r\nreaches unto everything called man, and nothing less than a universal\r\ngoodwill can content it. And indeed they are so apprehensive of the want\r\nof good employment, that they take the whole body of mankind for their\r\ncare.”\r\n\r\nAnd he concludes his panegyric with the recital of their chiefest fault,\r\n“which is very incident to almost all good things; and that is, that\r\nthere is not enough of them.”\r\n\r\nThe London outside this pleasant coterie was not so congenial to Robert\r\nBoyle. Above all, the sects and sectaries were his abomination. They were\r\ncoming over from Amsterdam like so many bills of exchange; they were like\r\n“diurnals,” eagerly read, and then in a day or two torn up as not worth\r\nkeeping. They were “mushrooms of last night’s coming up.” “If any man\r\nhave lost his religion,” he wrote, “let him repair to London, and I’ll\r\nwarrant him he shall find it: I had almost said too, and if any man has\r\na religion, let him but come hither now, and he shall go near to lose\r\nit.... For my part, I shall always pray God to give us _the unity of the\r\nSpirit in the bond of peace_....”[146]\r\n\r\nOne immediate outcome of these club meetings in Wood Street was a little\r\nscheme, evidently aided and abetted by Lady Ranelagh, which filled all\r\nRobyn’s thoughts on his return to Stalbridge in the spring of 1647. He\r\nwas going to set up a laboratory of his own, in the empty manor-house. It\r\nwas a scheme not easy to carry out in those days; and his first efforts\r\nwere to result in dire failure. “That great earthen furnace,” he wrote\r\nto Lady Ranelagh, “whose conveying hither has taken up so much of my\r\ncare, and concerning which I made bold very lately to trouble you, since\r\nI last did so, has been brought to my hands crumbled into as many pieces\r\nas we into sects; and all the fine experiments and castles in the air I\r\nhad built upon its safe arrival have felt the fate of its foundation.\r\nWell, I see I am not designed to the finding out the philosopher’s stone,\r\nI have been so unlucky in my first attempts at chemistry. My limbecks,\r\nrecipients, and other glasses have escaped indeed the misfortune of\r\ntheir incendiary, but are now, through the miscarriage of that grand\r\nimplement of Vulcan, as useless to me as good parts to salvation without\r\nthe fire of zeal. Seriously, Madam, after all the pains I have taken,\r\nand the precautions I have used, to prevent this furnace the disasters\r\nof its predecessors, to have it transported a thousand miles by land\r\nthat I may after all this receive it broken, is a defeat that nothing\r\ncould recompense, but that rare lesson it teaches me, how brittle that\r\nhappiness is that we build upon earth.”[147]\r\n\r\nThese words breathe the first hint of a melancholy in Robert Boyle’s\r\nlife, the causes of which—though he did his best to conceal and conquer\r\nthem—are not far to seek.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1646, when he was not yet twenty, there comes into his\r\nletters the note of physical suffering. Like many scholars and thinkers,\r\nRobert Boyle was very sensitive about physical pain, and the chances\r\nof infection and disease. As a boy at Eton, it will be remembered, the\r\n“potion” held more than ordinary terrors for the spiritay Robyn. Perhaps\r\nhe had heard about little Hodge, who had died at Deptford, after so\r\ndutifully swallowing the powder of unicorns’ horns. But even if not,\r\nhe must have seen the same thing happening all about him; he must have\r\nknown well enough that medical treatment in his day was steeped in the\r\noptimism of blackest ignorance. The plasters and powders and potions\r\nand purges with which the Faculty “wrought” so boldly on every disease,\r\nand the weird and melodramatic endings which were their usual results,\r\nhad given Robyn “a perfect aversion to all physick.” He believed that,\r\nin most cases, it “did but exasperate the disease.” Had not he seen\r\n“life itself almost disgorged together with a potion”? It was his own\r\nchildish experiences that inclined this experimentalist, all his life,\r\nto “apprehend more from the physician than the disease,” and set him to\r\napply himself to the study of physic “that he might have the less need of\r\nthem that profess it.” And so, though he was to count among his friends\r\nof the Philosophical College and elsewhere the most learned and eminent\r\nphysicians of his time, and as he grew older came to trusting very humbly\r\nand gratefully to the skill of more than one of them, Robert Boyle’s\r\ntendency, all through life, was to simplify medical treatment, and as far\r\nas possible to doctor himself with the aid of an intelligent and obedient\r\n“apothecary.”\r\n\r\nIf he had known that he was to live till he was sixty-five, and that the\r\nfive-and-forty years that lay before him were to be years of more or less\r\ninvalidism and suffering! But the long future was veiled; at twenty, the\r\nmonths in front of him were all-important. And he must have known as\r\nearly as 1646 that his attacks of pain and “ague fits” were caused by\r\nthe existence of renal calculus—the “gravel of the kidneys” of his day.\r\nHe knew of it when he wrote the letter to Hartlib (a fellow sufferer) in\r\nwhich he gratefully thanks good Mrs. Hartlib for a “receipt” or “sanative\r\nremedy,” which she had sent him in one of her husband’s letters, against\r\na disease that Robyn calls “so cruel in its tortures and so fatal in its\r\ncatastrophe.”[148]\r\n\r\nStalbridge, with this fact realised, was no longer the home of glad\r\npossibilities it may at first have promised to be; which the old Earl, in\r\nleaving it to his Benjamin, had certainly intended it to be. But Robert\r\nBoyle was making the best of it. “As for me,” he wrote to Hartlib—“during\r\nmy confinement to this melancholy solitude, I often divert myself at\r\nleisure moments in trying such experiments as the unfurnishedness of the\r\nplace and the present distractedness of my mind will permit me.” Friends\r\nand neighbours came about him; these were certain “young knights” and\r\nyoung Churchmen and “travellers out of France,” who appear under fancy\r\nnames in his _Reflections_: Eusebius, “a Dr. of Divinity,” Eugenius and\r\nGenorio, “Travellers and fine Gentlemen,” and Lindamor, “a learned youth,\r\nboth well born and well bred.” If they were not actually his guests at\r\nStalbridge, Robyn “took pleasure to imagine” them to “be present with me\r\nat the occasion”; and poetic licence has suggested that Lindamor may have\r\nbeen Robyn himself, in some of his moods, though he still figures in some\r\nof them as Philaretus and speaks in others of them of “Mr. Boyle”—even\r\nwhile he is using also the first personal pronoun. The Earl of Bristol’s\r\nfamily at Sherborne Castle were pleasant neighbours, and the family of\r\nSir Thomas Mallet, at Poynington—Sir Thomas and his Lady, and Mr. John\r\nMallet their son, and the young lady whom John Mallet was to marry—“the\r\nfair young lady you are happy in,” as Robert Boyle called her.\r\n\r\nRobyn’s own family—scattered and busy as they were—came to see him\r\nsometimes. He says himself that his sister, Lady Ranelagh, was “almost\r\nalways with him during his sickness”;[149] and his brother Frank seems\r\nto have been a welcome and cheerful guest at Stalbridge; while Robyn\r\nhimself rode over now and then to Marston Bigot, when “dear Broghill”\r\nand Lady Pegg were there. But his laboratory and his “standish” and\r\nbooks, and especially his correspondence with Hartlib in London, were\r\na great resource. It was at this time that he was writing the little\r\nessays he spoke of to Marcombes. Among them was his _Free Discourse\r\nagainst Customary Swearing_, which in manuscript pleased his relations,\r\nand was dedicated to his sister Kildare.[150] And it was then also that\r\nhe was writing his _Occasional Reflections upon Several Subjects_, which\r\nso delighted Lady Ranelagh.[151] They afford many glimpses into Robert\r\nBoyle’s life during the years spent at Stalbridge. He is to be seen in\r\nthem as the young Squire of gentle, studious tastes and simple habits,\r\nsitting, book in hand, over the slow-burning wood fire in the parlour\r\nwith the carved stone chimney-piece “fair and graceful in all respects”;\r\nor riding his horse along the up-and-down-hill Dorset lanes; angling by\r\nthe side of a stream, or walking in his own meadows, with his spaniel\r\nat his heels: philosophising as he goes; observing all things always;\r\ndreaming, perhaps, a little too—within bounds. The very titles of his\r\n_Reflections_ are an epitome of the life of those Stalbridge days. The\r\nspaniel is a constant companion, in weal and woe:—\r\n\r\n_Upon my Spaniel’s carefulness not to lose me in a Strange place_,\r\nand _Upon his manner of giving Meat to his Dogg_, are two of these\r\n_Reflections_.[152]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing very original in Robert Boyle’s method of feeding a dog,\r\nexcept that it carries with it his inevitable moral conclusions; but the\r\nyouthful essay hands down the picture of master and dog to posterity:—\r\n\r\n“For but observe this Dogg. I hold him out meat, and my inviting Voice\r\nloudly encourages and invites him to take it. ’Tis held indeed higher\r\nthan he can leap, and yet, if he leap not at it, I do not give it him;\r\nbut if he do, I let it fall half-way into his mouth.”\r\n\r\nSpaniels have fetched their masters’ gloves from time immemorial; but\r\nnone quite so graphically as Robert Boyle’s:—[153]\r\n\r\n“How importunate is he to be imployed about bringing me this glove!\r\nAnd with what Clamours and how many fawnings does he court me to fling\r\nit him! I never saw him so eager for a piece of Meat as I find him\r\nfor a Glove. And yet he knows it is no Food for him, nor is it Hunger\r\nthat creates his Longings for it; for now I have cast it him, he does\r\nnothing else with it but (with a kind of Pride to be sent for it, and a\r\nsatisfaction which his glad gestures make appear so great, that the very\r\nuse of Speech would not enable him to express it better) brings it me\r\nback again....”\r\n\r\nIn the mere names of these _Reflections_ may be traced the manner in\r\nwhich he spent his days: _Upon distilling the Spirit of Roses in a\r\nLimbick_: _Upon two very miserable Beggars begging together by the\r\nHighway_: _Upon the Sight of a Windmill standing still_: _Upon his\r\nCoaches being stopt in a narrow Lane_: _Upon the Sight of a fair Milkmaid\r\nSinging to her Cow_:[154] _Upon Talking to an Echo_: _Upon a Child that\r\nCri’d for the Stars_;—in which last are quoted Waller’s lines—\r\n\r\n    “Thus in a starry night fond children cry\r\n    For the rich spangles which adorn the sky.”\r\n\r\nOne of the _Reflections_, _Upon the Eating of Oysters_, possesses a\r\nsecondary interest: it is supposed to have suggested to Swift his\r\n_Gulliver’s Travels_. Like others of the _Reflections_, it is written in\r\nthe form of conversation between _Eugenius_ and _Lindamor_.[155]\r\n\r\n“EUG.—You put me in mind of a fancy of your Friend Mr. Boyle, who was\r\nsaying, that he had thoughts of making a short Romantick story, where\r\nthe Scene should be laid in some Island of the Southern Ocean, govern’d\r\nby some such rational Laws and Customs as those of _Utopia_ or the _New\r\nAtlantis_, and in the Country he would introduce an Observing Native,\r\nthat upon his return home from his Travels made in Europe should give an\r\naccount of our Countries and manners under feign’d Names, and frequently\r\nintimate in his Relations (or in his Answers to Questions that should be\r\nmade him) the reasons of his wondring to find our Customs so extravagant,\r\nand differing from those of his Country....”\r\n\r\nThe _Reflections_ show Robert Boyle as he lived and thought and felt;\r\nas he rose early on a “fair morning,” and looked up at the “variously\r\ncoloured clouds,” and listened to the lark’s song overhead; as he picked\r\nup a horse-shoe, watched boys at their games, or tried a prismatical\r\nor triangular glass; as he fished with a “counterfeit fly” along the\r\nriver-banks, or let the fish run away with the more homely bait; as he\r\nlooked at his own shadow cast in the face of a pool, or his own face in a\r\nlooking-glass with a rich frame. What an opportunity was the magnetical\r\nneedle of a sundial, or the use of a burning-glass, or the drinking of\r\nwater out of the brims of one’s own hat! What food for reflection was a\r\nsyrup made of violets, or a glow-worm included in a crystal viol! What\r\nthoughts fluttered about the tail of a paper kite flown on a windy day,\r\nor about a lanthorn and candle carried by on a dark and windy night! And\r\nRobert Boyle did once shoot something, as may be seen from the title of\r\none particular _Reflection_:\r\n\r\n“Killing a Crow (out of a window) in a Hog’s trough, and immediately\r\ntracing the ensuing _Reflection_ with a Pen made of one of his\r\nQuills....”\r\n\r\nVery early in his life there was, alas! the least touch of the\r\nvaletudinary about the “deare Squire.” It was not all fair mornings and\r\nlarks and roses. One section of his little book of essays is devoted to\r\n“the accidents of an ague,” and deals with the invasion, the hot and cold\r\nfits, the letting of blood, the taking of physick, the syrups and other\r\nsweet things sent by the doctor, the want of sleep, the telling of the\r\nstrokes of an ill-going clock in the night, the thief in the candle, the\r\ndanger of death, the fear of relapse; and at the end, when Robyn is his\r\nown man again—the “reviewing and tacking together the several bills filed\r\nup in the Apothecary’s Shop.”\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1647, Robert Boyle had been ill; but in the autumn\r\nhe paid some visits among his relations, and early in 1648 he went to\r\nHolland, “partly to visit the country,” and partly to help his brother\r\nFrank conduct his brilliant wife home from The Hague—a mission that must\r\nhave required all Frank’s sweetness of spirit and all Robyn’s philosophy.\r\nIn the summer of 1648, Robert Boyle was again in London;—this time, Lady\r\nRanelagh had taken rooms for him in St. James’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nA KIND OF ELYSIUM\r\n\r\n    “This blessed plot, this Earth, this Realme, this England,\r\n    This Nurse, this teeming wombe of Royall Kings,\r\n    Fear’d by their breed and famous for their birth,\r\n    Renowned for their deeds, as farre from home,\r\n    For Christian seruice, and true Chiualrie,\r\n    As is the sepulcher in stubborne Iury\r\n    Of the World’s ransome, blessed _Marie’s_ Sonne.\r\n    This Land of such deere soules, this deere-deere Land,\r\n    Deere for her reputation through the world....”\r\n\r\n                  Shakespeare’s _Richard the Second_ (First Folio, 1623).\r\n\r\n\r\nShakespeare was a little out of date in the summer of 1648, when Robert\r\nBoyle came to town from Stalbridge to the lodging in St. James’s taken\r\nfor him by his sister Ranelagh. “This England” was then still in the\r\nthroes of civil war; was, in fact, at the moment plunged in what is\r\nknown as the Second Civil War.[156] When Robert Boyle arrived in town,\r\neverybody was talking of the risings in the English counties (Dorsetshire\r\nitself among them), and the revolt of the fleet off the Kentish coast.\r\nThe King was in the Isle of Wight: since Robert Boyle had written his\r\nletter to Marcombes in October 1646, the King had been bandied about from\r\nthe Scots to the English, from the Parliament to the Army, from Holmby\r\nHouse to Hampton Court; and now, having escaped into the Isle of Wight\r\nonly to find himself virtually a prisoner in Carisbrooke Castle, he was\r\nyet in secret negotiation with Ormonde in France, and with Hamilton and\r\nthe Royalists in Scotland. Just at this time, “in spite of Argyle and the\r\nScottish Clergy”, a Royalist army was marching into England. The Queen\r\nand Prince and the Royalist Court at St. Germains were on tip-toe of\r\nexpectation; while the young Duke of York had escaped from London abroad,\r\ndisguised in girl’s clothes.[157] Ormonde was with the Court in France,\r\nand Inchiquin in Ireland had declared himself a Royalist. There had been\r\nalso successive Royalist risings in Wales and in the English counties.\r\nOf the Parliamentary Party, Lambert was in the north, Cromwell in Wales;\r\nand Fairfax and Ireton—the Kentish rising crushed—were now besieging\r\nColchester.\r\n\r\nAnd what was Robert Boyle doing during this London visit? After all,\r\nLondon was in the circumstances the most civilised place to be in.\r\nRobert Boyle was listening to the Earl of Warwick’s very full account\r\n“from his own mouth” of his recent negotiations with the rebellious\r\nfleet;—the Earl of Warwick, who was Mary Boyle’s father-in-law. And then,\r\nwhen the Earl of Warwick himself was hurrying off to Portsmouth to deal\r\nwith the “disobedient ships” there, Robert Boyle was supping quietly\r\nwith the ladies of the Warwick family at Warwick House in Holborn, and\r\nhearing from them all the latest gossip about the Essex rising, and the\r\nbehaviour of his brother-in-law Charles Rich. By their account, Charles\r\nRich had been the “grand agitator in this Essex business.” And the young\r\nSquire was much amused to hear also that the newly chosen Admiral of the\r\nrevolting ships was none other than one Kemb, a minister,—“a mad, witty\r\nfellow,” Robert Boyle calls him, “whom I have often been very merry with,\r\nhis wife being sister to the honest red-nosed blade that waits now on\r\nme.”[158]\r\n\r\nTimes had changed, indeed, since England was the royal throne of Kings,\r\nanother Eden, and a demi-paradise. No doubt the Invisibles met as usual\r\nin Wood Street, and Robert Boyle was often in congenial company with\r\nHartlib and the others there or at Gresham College. Young Lord Barrymore\r\nwas no longer with Milton in the Barbican. Milton had given up his\r\nschool, and he and his wife and their one little girl were living in High\r\nHolborn—very near to Warwick House—and Milton was now leading a literary\r\nlife, but keenly watching the doings of Parliament and Army; it was some\r\nmonths before he was made Secretary of Foreign Tongues to the Council of\r\nState. The young philosopher in St. James’s, who had his own ideals, was\r\nwatching them too, as keenly; though exactly how Robert Boyle felt about\r\nthe trend of events it is very difficult to guess. His “exact evenness\r\nof carriage” never deserted him: to use his own words, “The point of a\r\nmariner’s needle shows its inclination to the Pole both by its wavering\r\nand rest.” Royalists, Parliament-men, Army-men, Churchmen, Presbyterians,\r\nand Independents,—he was in the midst of them all, bound to many of them\r\nby ties of friendship and kinship, but steadfastly going his own way.\r\nIf he was in the company of Mary’s father-in-law, the Earl of Warwick,\r\nhe was also in Archbishop Usher’s study, listening to a very different\r\nkind of exposition, and he was writing affectionately to “dear Broghill”\r\nin his difficult position in Munster. If he spoke of “Our Masters” at\r\nWestminster, he spoke also of “Our Brethren” across the Borders. On the\r\nwhole, like Milton in Holborn, but from quite another standpoint, Robert\r\nBoyle seems to have fixed, if not his faith, his expectations, upon the\r\nNew Model. “Victory,” he wrote, “is as obedient as the very Parliament to\r\nthe Army.”[159]\r\n\r\nAnd meantime Lady Ranelagh was doing her best to push her young brother’s\r\nliterary interests, and make his London visit a pleasant one. She had\r\nbeen showing one of his manuscripts to her friend the Countess of\r\nMonmouth. The Countess was the daughter of an old acquaintance of the\r\nEarl of Cork, Lionel Cranfield, the clever merchant-adventurer, Lord\r\nMayor of London, High Treasurer, and first, Earl of Middlesex. It may be\r\nremembered that Marcombes had been tutor in the Middlesex family before\r\nhe took Kynalmeaky and Broghill abroad. The Countess had read and liked\r\nthe manuscript, and had sent the young Squire a flattering message and\r\ninvitation in a note to his sister Ranelagh. And it was with more than\r\nordinary pleasure that Robert Boyle sat down to indite his little letter\r\nof reply, a model of seventeenth-century epistolary homage, to the\r\nCountess of Monmouth at Moore Park—\r\n\r\n“Madam,” so runs the letter: “in your ladyship’s (imparted to me by my\r\nsister Ranelagh) I find myself so confounded with civilities, that if\r\nshe that blessed me with the sight of your letter had not (for her own\r\ndischarge) exacted of me this acknowledgment of my having seen it, I must\r\nconfess I should scarce have ventured to return a verbal answer, deterred\r\nby the impossibility of writing without wronging a resentment[160] which\r\nI can express as little as I deserved the praises and the favours that\r\nhave produced it.”\r\n\r\nAnd so on. The Countess had suggested the publication of his pamphlet.\r\nBut she did more: she had invited the young Squire to pay a visit to\r\nMoore Park, and to bring his manuscript in his pocket—\r\n\r\n“As for my pamphlet, Madam, had it expected the glory of entertaining\r\nyou, it should certainly have appeared in a less careless dress ... yet\r\nmy just sense of the smallness of the accession the Press can be to the\r\nhonour of your ladyship’s perusal makes me decline its publication. And\r\nas that paper cannot have either a higher applause or nobler end than\r\nthe being liked and practised at Moore Park, so if it have either anyway\r\ndiverted your ladyship, or had the least influence upon my lord, I have\r\nreached my desires and gone beyond my hopes. However, Madam, I am richly\r\nrewarded for writing such a book by being enjoyned to fetch it where\r\nyou are. So welcome a command is very unlikely to be disobeyed; but my\r\nobedience, Madam, must be paid to the order, not the motive. The fetching\r\nof my book may be one effect of my remove, but not the errand of it; for\r\nsure, Madam, your modesty cannot be so injurious, both to yourself and\r\nme, as to persuade you that any inferior (that is, other) motive can be\r\nlooked upon by me as an invitation to a journey which will bless me with\r\nso great a happiness as that of your ladyship’s conversation, and give\r\nme the opportunity of assuring you, better than my present haste and my\r\ndisorder will now permit me, in how transcendent a degree I am, Madam,\r\nyour Ladyship’s humble and obliged servant, Robert Boyle.”\r\n\r\nIt was a particularly cold, wet July[161]; the confusions of the country\r\nseemed to have infected the very air; and those people who were “wont\r\nto make fires, not against winter but against cold,” had “generally\r\ndisplac’d the florid and the verdant Ornaments in their chimneys,” where\r\n“Vulcan” was more proper than “Flora.”[162]\r\n\r\nBut it must be taken for granted that the sun shone out one day, not long\r\nafter the folding and dispatching of this letter to the Countess; and\r\nthat Robert Boyle and his horse did find their way by the old coach-road\r\nfrom London into Hertfordshire. And when they came to the little town of\r\nRickmansworth, lying sleepily in the valley, clustered about the huge\r\nChurch in its midst, horse and rider must have turned upwards to the\r\nleft, under spreading oak-trees. The “common way” still runs upwards\r\nthrough the Park.\r\n\r\nFor Moore Park, that once belonged to Shakespeare’s Earl of Pembroke,\r\n“stands on the side of a hill; but not very steep.” Sir William Temple\r\nhas described it, as it was in that day, when the Monmouth family owned\r\nit, “the sweetest place, I think, that I have ever seen in my life,\r\neither before or since, at home or abroad.” The length of the house lay\r\nupon the breadth of the garden. The great parlour, where the Countess\r\nwould receive her guest, opened on the middle of a terraced gravel-walk,\r\nset with standard laurels, which looked like orange-trees out of bloom.\r\nThere were fountains and statues and summer-houses in that garden—“the\r\nperfectest figure of a garden”—and shady cloisters, upon arches of stone,\r\nclustered over with vines. And beyond lay a wilderness, which was always\r\nin the shade. Robert Boyle must have been a happy man that day, as he\r\nalighted before those portals with his manuscript in his pocket.\r\n\r\nHenry Cary, second Earl of Monmouth, was a Royalist peer: his younger\r\nbrother, Thomas Cary, was the faithful groom of the bedchamber to\r\nCharles I. They were sons of the old Robert—the man who, the moment\r\nQueen Elizabeth was dead, had started on his record ride from London to\r\nEdinburgh to be the first to tell James VI that he was King of England.\r\nThe first Earl and his Countess—a Trevanion—lay buried in Rickmansworth\r\nChurch; and the second Earl and his Countess were, at the time of\r\nRobert Boyle’s visit, living quietly at Moore Park, the Earl having of\r\nlate withdrawn into retirement among his books and manuscripts.[163]\r\nFor he was a scholar, skilled in modern languages, and a writer—though\r\nnot one of his manuscripts remains. And he and the Countess were still\r\npassionately mourning the death of Lionel, their elder son and heir, who\r\nhad fallen in the battle of Marston Moor. The second son was married, in\r\nLondon[164]; and the family at Moore Park must have consisted entirely\r\nof daughters, though the eldest daughter had been married for some years\r\nto Mary Boyle’s rejected suitor, Mr. James Hamilton.[165] Mr. Hamilton\r\nhad married the Lady Anne Cary a few weeks after the Lady Mary Boyle’s\r\nrunaway marriage with Charles Rich. But not any of the other daughters at\r\nMoore Park—and there was a bevy of them—were married, or to be married,\r\nfor many years to come; which, in those days of early marriages, is a\r\nmatter for some wonder, especially as it is known, on Evelyn’s authority,\r\nthat one at least of these daughters was “beautifull and ingenious.”[166]\r\n\r\nHowever pleasant the visit to Moore Park may have been, it was soon\r\nover. Early in August Robert Boyle was staying with his sister Mary at\r\nthe Earl of Warwick’s house of Leeze, in Essex, and there finishing his\r\ntreatise on “Seraphick Love.” It purported to be written “by one young\r\ngentleman to another”—to that _Lindamor_, in fact, the “learned youth\r\nboth well-born and well-bred,” who makes the fourth of the little quartet\r\nin the _Reflections_. The manuscript was handed, “almost sheet by sheet,”\r\nas it was written, to the enthusiastic Mary; and then, having been, after\r\nthe fashion of the day, circulated among a favoured few, it was laid\r\ncarefully by, among the young Squire’s other papers. And in September he\r\nwas back again at Stalbridge.\r\n\r\nThe last months of that fateful year must have been, in many a quiet\r\nEnglish manor, the most dismal and depressing ever lived through. In\r\nhis seclusion, with pen and ink, limbecks and recipients, Robert Boyle\r\nwas to employ the months as best he could. To his Manor, set among\r\nits autumn orchards, reached by its stone-paved way between rows of\r\nelm-trees, there must have come from week to week, by friend or messenger\r\nor weekly news-sheet, the straggling tidings of those events that one\r\nafter the other were hurrying the Sovereign to his doom. The second\r\ncivil war had been trampled out; Cromwell’s great battle of Preston had\r\nbeen fought and Hamilton taken prisoner, while Robert Boyle was still\r\nat “delicious Leeze,” perfecting his treatise on “Seraphick Love.”\r\nAnd before he left Leeze there had come the news of the surrender of\r\nColchester to Fairfax, and the shooting of the two Royalist leaders. In\r\nSeptember the Parliamentary Commissioners were in the Isle of Wight; and\r\nthrough the shortening days of October and November even Dorsetshire and\r\nits “bye-paths of intelligence” must have been stirred by the doings\r\nof Parliament, the “high and fierce” debate that followed the Army\r\nRemonstrance, and the _coup d’état_ of the King’s abduction from the Isle\r\nof Wight to the melancholy Hurst Castle on the Hampshire mainland. And\r\nthen—Fairfax was at Whitehall; the Army was in possession of London.\r\n\r\nDecember came, and with it the last grim struggle of Parliament and Army\r\nfor the disposition of the person of the Sovereign. The King was brought\r\nto Windsor; and, Christmas over, Lords and Commons were in the last\r\nhand-grips. The King’s trial had begun: the trial of “Charles Stuart,\r\nKing of England,” in Westminster Hall, where Strafford had been tried\r\nand sentenced seven years before. How soon did the news of the King’s\r\nsentence reach the Manor of Stalbridge? “This Court doth adjudge that the\r\nsaid Charles Stuart, as a Tyrant, Traitor, Murderer and Public Enemy,\r\nshall be put to death by the severing of his head from his body.”\r\n\r\nHow soon did Robert Boyle hear the details of those last weeks and days\r\nand hours, with all the little traits, so kingly and so human, as the\r\nunhappy royal delinquent blindly approached his doom? How soon did some\r\npale-faced horseman bring the news to Stalbridge of that last scene of\r\nall?—the King walking in procession through the Park, from St. James’s to\r\nWhitehall; his stepping out of that Whitehall window on to the scaffold\r\nhung with black; the block and axe, and men in black masks; the companies\r\nof horse and foot below in the street; and from Charing Cross on the one\r\nside to Westminster Abbey on the other, the close-packed crowds of the\r\npopulace, waiting....\r\n\r\n“The axe descended, severing the head from the body at one blow. There\r\nwas a vast shudder through the mob, and then a universal groan.”[167]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLord Broghill had given up his post in Munster under the Parliament;\r\nand he and Lady Broghill and their young children were living quietly\r\nat Marston Bigot. There Broghill amused himself by writing his\r\n_Parthenissa_; and there, in the spring of 1649, Robert Boyle paid\r\na visit to his brother and Lady Pegg. He, too, was busy with his\r\nmanuscripts, and in pleasant enough correspondence with the Invisibles\r\nin London. But in August he was at Bath. A letter to Lady Ranelagh,\r\ndated from Bath, August 2, “late at night,” was written in by no means a\r\nlight-hearted vein. His “native disposition” had made him shy, he said,\r\nof disclosing his afflictions where he could not expect their redress.\r\nHe was “too proud to seek a relief in the being thought to need it.”\r\nMoreover, he had been ill again, of “a quotidian ague.” His manuscript\r\non “Public Spiritedness” had been laid aside, and his “vulcanian feats”\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\n“The melancholy which some have been pleased to misrepresent to you as\r\nthe cause of my distempers is certainly much more the effect of them.” He\r\nhad only just arrived at Bath, having been carried there on a litter; and\r\nthere he was intending to stay till he could leave it on horseback. The\r\nphysicians had led him to hope he might be able to crawl to London before\r\nvery long.\r\n\r\nBut the end of August found him back in his laboratory among the\r\norchards—not very pleasantly occupied in “drawing,” for his own use, “a\r\nquintessence of wormwood.” He had been too much occupied of late even to\r\nwrite to his sister Ranelagh. There is in his letter the least little\r\nsuggestion that the events of this last year—personal, it may be, as well\r\nas political—had kept even this brother and sister apart; but it was for\r\nthe time only.\r\n\r\n“For Vulcan,” he wrote, “has so transported and bewitched me, that,\r\nas the delights I taste in it make me fancy my laboratory a kind of\r\n_Elysium_, so as if the threshold of it possessed the quality the poets\r\nascribed to that _Lethe_ their fictions made men taste of before their\r\nentrance into those seats of bliss, I there forget my standish and my\r\nbooks, and almost all things, but the unchangeable resolution I have made\r\nof continuing till death, Sister, your\r\n\r\n                                                              “R. B.”[168]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHERMETIC THOUGHTS\r\n\r\n    “A Monarch may command my Life or Fortune but not my opinion: I\r\n    cannot command this myself; it arises only from the Nature of\r\n    the Thing I judge of.”—ROBERT BOYLE.\r\n\r\n    “... A general chemical council, not far from _Charing Cross_,\r\n    sits often, and hath so behaved itself hitherto, that things\r\n    seem now to hasten towards some settlement.... They are about\r\n    an universal laboratory, to be erected after such a manner as\r\n    may redound, not only to the good of this island, but also to\r\n    the health and wealth of all mankind.”—SAMUEL HARTLIB _to_\r\n    ROBERT BOYLE, _May 1654_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Broghill had laid aside his _Parthenissa_. The story goes that\r\nin the autumn of 1649 he was meditating, under cover of a course of\r\ntreatment for the gout, a visit to Spa, which would take him into the\r\nneighbourhood of the “royal orphan”; and one account, at least, of\r\nhow Cromwell intercepted Broghill in London is too picturesque to be\r\ndiscarded.\r\n\r\nNobody—so runs the story—was in the secret of Broghill’s little plan\r\nexcept his wife, Lady Pegg, and perhaps his sister Ranelagh, at whose\r\nhouse, in the Old Mall, Broghill arrived on a certain day in the dusk,\r\nwith only four servants in attendance, to take leave of her before\r\nsetting out on his journey to Spa.\r\n\r\n“My Lord came, and was no sooner housed but heard a voice ask for my Lord\r\nBroghill: he thereupon charged his faithful sister with treachery; but\r\nher protestation of being innocent tempered him.” The messenger proved\r\nto be a “sightly Lieutenant,” sent by the Lord General to know when and\r\nwhere he might interview Broghill; and, after a good deal of parleying,\r\na meeting was arranged for early next morning in St. James’s Garden.\r\nCromwell was there first, with a group of his officers about him, and\r\nBroghill soon learnt that his correspondence with the “royal orphan” was\r\ndiscovered, and that he must make his choice. “The dilemma is short,”\r\nCromwell is reported to have said; “if you go with me in this expedition\r\nto reduce the Irish rebels, you may live, otherwise you certainly\r\ndie.”[169]\r\n\r\nWhatever the details, the fact remains that Broghill accepted Cromwell’s\r\noffer, and returned to Ireland with some sort of understanding that,\r\nwhile he would serve Cromwell and the cause of Protestantism under the\r\nParliament, he was not to be required to fight against any but the\r\nIrish.[170] Accordingly, in December 1649, “dear Broghill” was in Ireland\r\nagain, and Robert Boyle was writing to congratulate him on a brilliant\r\nseries of successes at Kinsale, Cork, Bandon and Youghal. “And truly that\r\nwhich most endears your acquisitions to me is that they have cost you so\r\nlittle blood.”[171] Cromwell had known his man; a veritable son of the\r\nold soldier-statesman, whose name was alive yet in Munster. There could\r\nhave been no Rebellion in Ireland, said Cromwell, if every county had\r\ncontained an Earl of Cork.\r\n\r\nOther members of the Boyle family were back in Ireland. The eldest\r\nbrother, Dungarvan, now Earl of Cork, the good-natured head of the\r\nfamily, and his no less good-natured Countess were living at Lismore\r\nor in Dublin. Frank and “black Betty,” as Robert Boyle had dubbed the\r\nlittle sister-in-law, were living near Castle Lyons; and there also\r\nwas Lady Barrymore, whose “wild boy,” so lately Milton’s pupil in the\r\nBarbican, was now a very young married man. To his mother’s discomfiture,\r\nand sorely against her wishes, young Barrymore had married another of the\r\nfascinating Killigrews; and the same batch of Irish letters that carried\r\nRobert Boyle’s congratulations to Broghill took also a very wise letter,\r\nwritten from London, to his eldest sister, Lady Barrymore.[172] He had\r\nknown nothing about the marriage till it was over.\r\n\r\n“Without pretending to excuse or extenuate what is past, having minded\r\nyou that there is a difference betwixt seasonable and just, I shall\r\nventure only to represent to you that the question is not now whether or\r\nno the marriage be a thing fit to be done, but how it is to be suffered;\r\nand that as the best gamesters have not the privilege of choosing their\r\nown cards, but their skill consists in well playing the game that is\r\ndealt them, so the discreetest persons are not allowed the choice of\r\nconditions and events, but their wisdom consists in making the best of\r\nthose accidents that Providence is pleased to dispense them.” And he\r\nreminds his sister that, as she has declared openly for the Royalist\r\nparty, the mediation of a “crowned intercessor” in this matter is not\r\nto be disregarded. Moreover, some of her nearest friends, “though they\r\nthink the match very unhappy, think it unfit the married pair should be\r\nso.”[173]\r\n\r\nThe letter heralds Robert Boyle’s own arrival in Ireland on a visit to\r\nhis sister at Castle Lyons, and to the various family homes in Munster.\r\nHis Irish estates were certainly calling for his attention; but the\r\nvisit was to be postponed. Broghill’s diplomatic victories were but the\r\nbeginning of bloody warfare. Broghill was to serve Cromwell through the\r\nwhole of the war with Ireland, in a series of brilliant engagements. “A’\r\nBroghill! A’ Broghill!” was the battle-cry that led on his men; and he\r\nnarrowly escaped with his life in the last engagement of all—his victory\r\nat Knockbrack. Broghill was the man aimed at. “Kill the fellow in the\r\ngold-laced coat!” the Irish soldiers shouted to each other. But Broghill\r\nwas not killed, though “my boldest horse,” he wrote, “being twice\r\nwounded, became so fearful that he was turned to the coach.”[174]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1650 Robert Boyle was still at Stalbridge, writing on\r\nMay Day to thank Hartlib for his gossip about _Utopia_ and _Breda_:[175]\r\n“my inclinations as much concerning me in _Republicâ Literariâ_ as\r\nmy fortune can do in _Republicâ Anglicanâ_. Nor am I idle, though my\r\nthoughts only are not at present useless to the advancement of learning;\r\nfor I can sometimes make shift to snatch from the importunity of my\r\naffairs leisure to trace such plans and frame such models, etc., as,\r\nif my Irish fortune will afford me quarries and woods to draw competent\r\nmaterials from to construct after them, will fit me to build a pretty\r\nhouse in Athens, where I may live to philosophy and Mr. Hartlib.”\r\n\r\nAt this time, Ireland and Athens were equally remote. Was there an\r\nattraction, other than the Invisibles, that still kept Robert Boyle\r\nwithin reach of London? Many years afterwards—after Robert Boyle was\r\ndead—his old friend John Evelyn, writing about him to Dr. Wotton said:\r\n“Tho’ amongst all his experiments he never made that of the maried life,\r\nyet I have been told he courted a beautifull and ingenious daughter\r\nof Carew,[176] Earl of Monmouth, to which is owing the birth of his\r\n_Seraphick Love_.”\r\n\r\nWas this, indeed, the love-story of Robert Boyle’s life? If so, it was\r\nlived through between the years 1648 and 1650. As early as the cold\r\nJanuary of 1648, at Stalbridge, on the very day he came of age, in some\r\nmoment of depression or decision, the boy had made a little sacrifice\r\nto Vulcan: he had resolutely burned most of the verses, “amorous,\r\nmerry and devout” that he had written in idle moments, and laid away\r\n“uncommunicated.”[177] Then, when spring came, and the Stalbridge\r\norchards were white with blossom, he had set off on his visit to London,\r\nand taken up his abode in those rooms in St. James’s that had been\r\nengaged for him by his sister Ranelagh. Early in June, he was writing to\r\nhis friend Mrs. Hussey—presumably a Dorsetshire friend and neighbour—a\r\nletter full of political gossip, written the very day after he had supped\r\nwith the ladies at Warwick House. But how does the letter end?\r\n\r\n“But, Madam, since I began to write this letter, I had unexpectedly the\r\nhappiness of a long conversation with the fair lady, that people are\r\npleased to think my mistress; and truly, Madam, though I am as far from\r\nbeing in love as most that are so are from being wise, yet my haste makes\r\nme gladly embrace the old excuse of\r\n\r\n    ‘Then to speak sense\r\n    Were an offence’\r\n\r\nto extenuate my having hitherto written so dully, and my concluding\r\nso abruptly; for whilst this amorous rapture does possess, I neither\r\ncould write sense without being injurious to my passion, nor can any\r\nlonger continue to write nonsense, without some violation of that\r\nprofound respect which is due to you from, and vowed you by, Madam, your\r\nladyship’s most faithful and most humble servant.”\r\n\r\nIf the fair lady who talked so delightfully, were indeed a “beautifull\r\nand ingenious daughter” of the Earl of Monmouth, Robert Boyle’s\r\nlove-story goes into a nutshell. For just a month later came the Countess\r\nof Monmouth’s letter to Lady Ranelagh, which so confounded the young\r\nsquire with its civilities, and contained the invitation to Moore Park.\r\nThe two young people had already met, and been attracted to one another:\r\nthe lady’s name had been already spoken of among their mutual friends as\r\nthat of a possible bride for the young Squire; Lady Ranelagh, at whose\r\nhouse, it is probable, they had first met, and who was certainly anxious\r\nto see Robyn with a wife of his own at Stalbridge, had been in private\r\nconclave with Lady Monmouth; and the Countess herself, the mother of a\r\nbevy of daughters, was disposed to look kindly on the young Squire, in\r\nspite of his Geneva-bred philosophy, and his not very robust health.\r\nFor he was the youngest son of a very great family; cultured, amiable,\r\nvirtuous—and likely to be a moderately rich man, when once his Irish\r\naffairs could be put in order. But there was the Earl of Monmouth to\r\ndeal with; a Churchman, and passionately Royalist. There is a sentence\r\nin Robyn’s letter to the Countess which carries with it a suggestion\r\nthat she, rather than the Earl, was interested in the young suitor:\r\n“If,” he says, of his precious manuscript, which she had asked him to\r\nbring to Moore Park, “it have either any way diverted your Ladyship, _or\r\nhad the least influence upon my Lord_, I have reached my desires and\r\ngone beyond my hopes.” Did the Earl of Monmouth look unfavourably upon\r\nthe young Puritan, or desire to extract from him promises—a statement\r\nabout his religious and political convictions—which Robert Boyle was\r\nunwilling to make? And the fair lady herself—what amount of say had she\r\nin the matter? If Robyn had joined the King’s Army would he have won\r\nhis _Hermione_?[178] In his _Seraphick Love_, he speaks of Hermione’s\r\n“cold usage.” It is quite possible that this beautiful and ingenious\r\ndaughter of the Monmouth family may have merely looked shyly on Robert\r\nBoyle, his manuscript treatises and his little valetudinary ways;\r\nbut it is also possible that, young as she was—she can scarcely have\r\nbeen more than seventeen—she was a girl not only of strong hereditary\r\nfeelings, brought up a strict Churchwoman and Royalist, but of spirit and\r\nconviction—a character as firm as Robert Boyle’s itself. _The Martyrdom\r\nof Theodora and of Didymus_, Robert Boyle’s quaint and powerful prose\r\nromance—of which only the second part was ever published, and that\r\nnot until 1687—was written in his early youth, and even more than his\r\n_Seraphick Love_ seems as if it may hold the internal evidence of his\r\nown love-story. If _Seraphick Love_ speaks of a woman’s “cold usage” the\r\nstory of Theodora and Didymus explains it. The character of Theodora is\r\nworth studying, if this is indeed Robert Boyle’s ideal of womanhood.\r\nIt is the character of a woman young and beautiful, who is not only an\r\nuncommonly good talker, but “declares her aversion for marriage.” Her\r\nreasons are given to her friend Irene, who has “solicited favour for\r\nDidymus.”\r\n\r\n“Marriage,” says Theodora, “is one of the most important Things of Life;\r\nand though I esteem it a mean Notion of Happiness to think that one\r\nPerson can make either of them the Portion of another, yet Discretion,\r\nas well as Sincerity and Chastity, oblige a woman to have a great deal\r\nof Care of that which concerns the Term of her Life; and a Woman that\r\ndesigns to behave herself like a Wife, ought to take care in a Choice\r\nshe can make but once, and not carelessly to enter on a Voyage where\r\nShipwracks are so frequent, though she be offered a fine ship to make it\r\nin. But since my dear _Irene_ takes this opportunity to know more of my\r\nThoughts than I should disclose to any other Person, I must tell her that\r\nwere I at my own disposal, and should be willing to make such a Change\r\nas I have always been averse to, Didymus’s Virtues and Services would\r\ninfluence me more than the Advantages of Titles, Riches or Dignities\r\nof his Rivals could. But dear _Irene_, the times are such, and my\r\nCircumstances too, that it would be very extravagant for me to engage\r\nmyself further in the World. For a Christian cannot think to be happy,\r\nwhilst the Church is miserable, and perplexed with outward Calamities....\r\nWhen I think,” proceeds Theodora, “of the Church’s Desolation, and\r\nthat I should not only be content to be a Spectator, but an Actor in\r\nthe Tragedy, I cannot relish the Complements of a Lover, nor hope\r\nfor Contentment, except from a Place above the reach of Persecution.\r\nAnd these Sentiments,” says she, “are warranted by the Apostle, who\r\nDiscouraged Women that were free, in much less troublesome times, from\r\nentering into a Marriage State....”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd which of the bevy of Monmouth daughters was it that would not marry\r\nRobert Boyle?—“a beautifull and ingenious daughter,” says Evelyn; that is\r\nall that is known of her. Anne, the eldest, had in 1648 been some years\r\nmarried to James Hamilton, Earl of Clanbrassil; and of the six other\r\ndaughters born to the Earl and Countess of Monmouth, only three seemed\r\nto have reached maturity—Elizabeth, Mary and Martha—of whom Elizabeth\r\nmust have been seventeen in 1648. These three, with the Countess, his\r\nwidow, were left in the Earl’s will—dated July 1659—his co-heirs. They\r\nwere then all three unmarried; the Earl their father left some of the\r\nproperty under certain conditions relating to their being, as he quaintly\r\nexpressed it, “in my life preferred in marriage or otherwise dead.” It\r\nwas not till some years after the Earl of Monmouth’s death that Mary and\r\nMartha married—Mary becoming the second wife of the Earl of Desmond\r\nand Martha the second wife of the Earl of Middleton. Elizabeth died\r\nin December 1676, and was buried a few months before the Countess of\r\nMonmouth, her mother, in Rickmansworth Church. The inscription on the\r\nstone over her grave is not an ordinary one—\r\n\r\n                           Sacred to the Memory\r\n                   of yᵉ Right Honᵇˡᵉ yᵉ Lady Elizabeth\r\n                   Cary one of yᵉ Davghters & Co-heirs\r\n                        of the Right Honᵇˡᵉ Henry\r\n                      Lord Cary Baron of Leppington\r\n                       and Earle of Monmovth. Shee\r\n                     dyed the 14ᵗʰ day of December in\r\n                      the year of ovr Lord 1676 & in\r\n                     the 46ᵗʰ year of her age having\r\n                     livd all her time vnmarried bvt\r\n                   now expecting A joyfvll Resvrrecᵗⁱᵒⁿ\r\n                       and to be joynd to her onely\r\n                     Spouse and Saviour Jesvs Christ,\r\n                      lies here interd near the said\r\n                         Earle      her Father.\r\n\r\nWas this the heroine of Boyle’s love story—the _Hermione_ whose “cold\r\nusage” sent him to write his _Seraphick Love_ at Leeze?—the woman whose\r\nviews on a Marriage State found their way into his _Martyrdom of Theodora\r\nand of Didymus_? It will probably never be known. Whoever the lady,\r\nwhatever the reason, the affair seems to have been, in modern parlance,\r\n“off” before the end of 1648. And yet, a whole year later, in December\r\n1649, Robert Boyle was in London again, scorching his wings at the flame.\r\n\r\n“I know Frank will endeavour to persuade you,” he wrote to his sister\r\nBarrymore, “that it is the thing called Love that keeps me here”; and\r\nto Lord Broghill, at the same date, “My next shall give you an account\r\nof my transactions, my studies, and my _amours_; of the latter of which\r\nblack Betty will tell you as many lies as circumstances; but hope you\r\nknow too well what she is and whence she comes not to take all her\r\nstories for fictions....”\r\n\r\nSome strong attraction, then, in or near London, there undoubtedly\r\nwas, and Robert Boyle’s family knew of it; but all their thrusts were\r\nsuccessfully parried in what Sir Henry Wotton had called Robyn’s “pretty\r\nconceits.” In company Robert Boyle was to “prate” with “pure raillery” of\r\n“matrimony and amours.” He was to pity those who “dote on red and white.”\r\nHe never could deplore the lover who “by losing his mistress recovers\r\nhimself.” He was to declare that he had “never known the infelicities\r\nof love except by others’ sufferings”; to write exultantly about “this\r\nuntamed heart.” He had, he said, so seldom seen a happy marriage, that\r\nhe did not wonder “our Lawgivers should make marriage indesolvable to\r\nmake it lasting.” Marriage was “a Lottery, in which there are many blanks\r\nto one prize.” And yet Robyn was as sensitive as he was proud. Not in\r\ncompany which prated of “matrimony and amours,” he had his own ideal.\r\nLove to him remained “the Noblest Passion of the Mind”; and at twenty-one\r\nhe acknowledged the existence of “a peculiar unrivaled sort of Love,\r\nwhich constitutes the Conjugal Affections.” Lady Ranelagh, frustrated in\r\none attempt, might go on hoping. “If you are in the west,” she wrote at a\r\nlater date to this incorrigible brother, “let me beseech you to present\r\nmy humble service to my two Lady Bristols, and wish you would disappoint\r\nFrank[179] by bringing a wife of your own to Stalbridge, a business I\r\nmust still mind you of, though you give me cause to doubt you will as\r\nhardly pardon me those few words as the rest of the trouble given you\r\nhere by your K. R.”\r\n\r\nBut there was to be no other fair lady in Robyn’s letters or in Robyn’s\r\nlife—no lady whose conversational powers ever again produced in him\r\nan “amorous rapture.” He returned to his “kind of Elysium,” and the\r\nlethal chamber of chemical research. And when once a rumour reached\r\nhis relatives in Ireland that he was actually married, and his nephew\r\nBarrymore’s wife[180] was foremost in her congratulations, there was a\r\ntouch of the philosopher-uncle in Robert Boyle’s superlatively polite\r\nreply. “Alas! The little gentleman and I,” he assured her, “are still at\r\nthe old defiance.”\r\n\r\nNot till 1652, after Cromwell’s campaign was over, and the war in Ireland\r\nnearly at an end, did Robert Boyle revisit the land of his birth. And\r\nthen he did not like it. “I must sadly confess,” he wrote, in very\r\nevident dejection, to his Dorsetshire friend, John Mallett, “that the\r\nperpetual hurry I live in, my frequent journeys, and the necessary\r\ntrouble of endeavouring to settle my long-neglected and disjointed\r\nfortune, has left me very little time to converse with any book save the\r\nBible, and scarce allowed me time to sew together some loose sheets that\r\ncontain my thoughts about the Scriptures.”\r\n\r\nIt must have been with a strange conflict of feelings that he found\r\nhimself at last in Youghal, standing before the tomb of his great father,\r\non the very scene of the old Earl’s last struggle in the Protestant and\r\nRoyalist cause. He wandered about the house and gardens of Lismore once\r\nagain, and found this home of his childhood, in his father’s day “one of\r\nthe noblest seats and greatest ornaments of the province of Munster,” now\r\n“ruined by the sad fate of war.”[181] The fortunes of the Boyle family\r\nwere at this time at their lowest ebb, and everywhere that he went he was\r\nin the track of the brutalities of war; the very bloodstains of those\r\nlast engagements could scarcely have been dried; the severed head and\r\nlimbs must still have been sticking on the poles. “About the years 1652\r\nand 1653 ... the plague and famine had swept away whole counties, that a\r\nman might travel twenty or thirty miles and not see a living creature,\r\neither man, beast, or bird, they being either all dead, or had quit those\r\ndesolate places.” And in the mountains so greatly had the number of\r\nwolves increased, that rewards were being offered for wolves’ heads.[182]\r\n\r\nBut already, under Cromwell’s powerful lord-lieutenancy, and with\r\nFleetwood as head of the Irish Government, the work of settlement and\r\ntransplantation had been begun. It was in part, perhaps, the work of\r\ntransplantation in Connaught—for Robert Boyle had lands there as well as\r\nin Munster—that called him to Ireland in 1652. He was back in London, on\r\na flying visit, in the autumn of 1653, just between Cromwell’s dismissal\r\nof the _Rump_ and the sitting of the _Barebones_ Parliament; when, in\r\nfact, “This House” was “to be let—now unfurnished.”[183]\r\n\r\nBut he was in Ireland again a month or two before Cromwell’s Protectorate\r\nwas proclaimed in London, and living in Dublin through the winter of\r\n1653-4. William Petty, his fellow-Invisible, was also there, and Benjamin\r\nWorsley, the old Army surgeon, a great friend of Hartlib and of the Boyle\r\nfamily. Petty had been appointed by Ireton physician-general to the Army,\r\nand was doing wonderful things in organisation, amongst other things\r\nsaving the Government several hundreds a year in their drug department\r\nalone. Worsley, a delightful man in his way, full of the most astonishing\r\nscientific projects for the benefit of seventeenth-century science,\r\nhad been appointed surveyor-general, to take in hand the land-survey\r\nnecessary in the process of transplantation. In Petty’s opinion Worsley\r\nwas a bit of a quack, whose “mountain-bellied conceptions” ended usually\r\nin “abortive mice”; and when Worsley began his survey Petty thought it\r\ncould be better and quicker done, and said so. The Government backed\r\nPetty, in whom they had got hold of a man of extraordinary genius and\r\nenergy; and while Worsley was kept on as surveyor-general, Petty was\r\nallowed to contract to do the work of land-survey in thirteen months,\r\nimporting skilled labour and London-made instruments.[184] And meantime,\r\nRobert Boyle, under Petty’s guidance, was working quietly in an\r\nanatomical laboratory in Dublin. Petty, in his outspoken way, had written\r\nto Boyle while Boyle was on his flying visit to London in 1653. Petty and\r\nRobert Boyle’s own relations in Dublin were at this time a little anxious\r\nabout Boyle’s health and spirits; and urged by the relatives, Petty had\r\nwritten in the character of physician and friend, offering Boyle some\r\nsound advice. He wrote to “dissuade” him from “some things which my lord\r\nof Cork, my lord of Broghill, and some others of your friends think\r\nprejudicial to you; one of which is your continual reading.” Too much\r\nreading, Petty thought, “weakens the brain,” which weakness “causeth\r\ndefluxions” and these “hurt the lungs.” In Petty’s opinion Boyle, who\r\nknew so much already, could get but little advantage from the constant\r\nstudy of books. Warming with his subject, Petty adventures a little more\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n“The next disease you labour under is your apprehension of many diseases,\r\nand a continual fear that you are always inclining, or falling into, one\r\nor other.” He reminds Boyle how “this is incident to all that begin the\r\nstudy of diseases”; how “inward causes” may produce “different outward\r\nsigns,” and those “little rules of prognostication, found in our books,\r\nneed not always be so religiously believed.” And even if people do fall\r\nill, do they not also sometimes get well again? “Why may not a man as\r\neasily recover of a disease, without much care, as fall into it?” And\r\nthen, to wind up with: “The last indictment that I lay against you\r\nis, practising upon yourself with medicaments (though specifics) not\r\nsufficiently tried by those that administer or advise them.”\r\n\r\nPhysician as he was, Petty did not put his faith in “medicaments”—witness\r\nhis savings in the Army drug department. “There is a conceit current in\r\nthe world,” he told Robert Boyle, “that a medicament may be physic and\r\nphysician alike.” What a mistake!\r\n\r\n“Recommendations of medicaments do not make them useful, but do only\r\nincite me to make them so by endeavouring experimentally to find out the\r\nvirtues and application of them.” And it is a hard matter to discover\r\ntheir true virtues. “As I weep to consider,” says Petty, “so I dread to\r\nuse them, without my utmost endeavour first employed to that purpose.”\r\n\r\nIt is a manly, outspoken letter, though it may have seemed a little\r\ncaustic at the time. And it had its effect. Robert Boyle came back to\r\nDublin to work, under Petty’s direction, at anatomical dissection—and\r\npossibly to read less. He was still ailing, still dejected, still longing\r\nto be back in London; but, “that I may not live wholly useless,” he wrote\r\nto Mr. Clodius, Hartlib’s doctor son-in-law in London, “or altogether a\r\nstranger in the study of Nature, since I want glasses and furnaces to\r\nmake a chemical analysis of inanimate bodies, I am exercising myself in\r\nmaking anatomical dissections of living animals, wherein (being assisted\r\nby your father-in-law’s ingenious friend, Dr. Petty (our General’s\r\nPhysician)) I have satisfied myself of the circulation of the blood and\r\nthe (freshly discovered and hardly discoverable) _receptaculi chyli_,\r\nmade by the confluence of the _venæ lacteæ_, and have seen (especially\r\nin the dissections of fishes) more of the variety and contrivances of\r\nNature and the majesty and wisdom of her Author than all the books I ever\r\nread in my life could give me convincing notions of.” While he is kept a\r\nprisoner in Ireland, he says, he will be delighted if there is anything\r\nhe can do to help Clodius in an anatomical way; if there is anything\r\n“wherein my knives may give you any satisfaction, I shall be very proud\r\nto employ them to so elevated an end.” Meantime he was doing as Clodius\r\nhad asked him—looking into the “mineral advantages of Ireland.” But “in\r\nthis illiterate country, I find all men so perfect strangers to matters\r\nof that nature, that my inquiries have been as fruitless as diligent.”\r\nHe can hear nothing about antimony mines; “but for iron I may be able\r\nto give you a good account of it, and to bring you over of the ore, my\r\neldest brother having upon his land an iron-work that now yields him\r\na good revenue, and I having upon my own land an iron-mine, to which,\r\nbefore the wars, belonged a (since ruined) work, which I have thoughts\r\nof resetting up. I am likewise told (but how truly I know not yet) of a\r\nlittle silver-mine lying in some land of mine; and very lately in a place\r\nwhich belongs to a brother of mine they have found silver ore very rich,\r\nfor, being tried, it is estimated (as he tells me that means to deal for\r\nit) at between thirty and forty pounds a ton; but whether or no this be\r\na mine of proportionable value we do not yet know. I was yesterday with\r\nan officer of the Army who farms a silver-mine for the State, who hath\r\npromised me what assistance he can in my mineral inquiries, and told me\r\nthat a metallist and refiner whom he extolled with superlative elogies\r\nassured him that there was no country in Europe so rich in mines as\r\nIreland, had but the inhabitants the industry to seek them, and the skill\r\nto know them.”\r\n\r\nBut Robert Boyle was impatient to leave Ireland. “I live here in a\r\nbarbarous country,” he told Clodius in this letter, “where chemical\r\nspirits are so misunderstood, and chemical instruments so unprocurable,\r\nthat it is hard to have any hermetic thoughts in it and impossible to\r\nbring them to experiment.”\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1654 he was back in England. In the previous year,\r\nduring his flying visit to London, he had talked with Dr. Wilkins, of\r\nWadham, about Oxford, and had probably ridden down to Oxford to see\r\nwhat it was like. Stalbridge was all very well, but it was removed from\r\nthe by-paths of intelligence; somehow, since his illnesses, there was a\r\nsadness over its orchards which Vulcan himself could not dispel. London\r\nwas a fascinating labyrinth of interests, but in Oxford he believed\r\nhe could “live to philosophy.” Oxford was to be his Athens. Thither,\r\nalready, some of the Invisibles had migrated from London. For it was no\r\nlonger the old Royalist Oxford, where the sunburnt boy with the bow and\r\narrows had once thought of joining the King’s Army. It was Oxford six\r\nyears after the Parliament’s Visitation and Purgation; Oxford after the\r\nimposition of the Covenant. The old Heads had conformed or been summarily\r\nejected, the new Heads were Commonwealth men; and Cromwell himself was\r\nChancellor. It was an Oxford where the use of the Liturgy was not openly\r\npermitted. And yet, “speech is thrall, but thocht is free,” says the old\r\nScottish proverb. At Oxford a man could still fast quietly, if he was\r\nso minded, for forty-one hours, without being sent down for it.[185] At\r\nOxford one might still study philosophy, and mathematics, and Oriental\r\nlanguages unimpeded. And there was the Bodleian. Oxford was indeed “the\r\nonly place in England where, at that time, Mr. Boyle could have lived\r\nwith much satisfaction to himself.”[186]\r\n\r\nHis horse would carry him between Oxford and London at any time: each\r\nnight, on the road, he might lie under some hospitable roof of friend\r\nor relative, in mansions set in shady parks, amid flower-gardens and\r\nfishponds. And once in London, his sister Ranelagh’s door in the Old Mall\r\nwas always open to him. And Gresham College, and Mr. Hartlib, and Mr.\r\nClodius, and the rest of the Invisibles would receive him with ecstasy.\r\nThe Hartlib family had moved to Charing Cross; and Hartlib and his “very\r\nchemical son” were excessively happy in their new abode.\r\n\r\n“As for us, poor earthworms, we are crawling in my house about our\r\nquondam back-kitchen, whereof my son hath made a goodly laboratory; yea,\r\nsuch a one, as men (who have had the favour and privilege to see or be\r\nadmitted into it) affirm they have never seen the like for its several\r\nadvantages and commodiousnesses. It hath been employed days and nights\r\nwith no small success, God be praised, these many weeks together.”[187]\r\n\r\nLondon was labyrinthine: there was an undeniable fascination about\r\nHartlib’s quondam back-kitchen; but Oxford beckoned. And so, at the age\r\nof twenty-seven, Robert Boyle went to Oxford; a student always, already\r\nknown as a scholar and philosopher, one of the chief of the Invisibles,—a\r\nready-made Don.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nOXFORD: A LEARNED JUNTO\r\n\r\n    “... I see no cause to despair that, whether or no my writings\r\n    be protected, the truths they hold forth will in time, in spite\r\n    of opposition, establish themselves in the minds of men, as the\r\n    circulation of the blood, and other, formerly much contested,\r\n    truths have already done. My humour has naturally made me\r\n    too careful not to offend those I dissent from, to make it\r\n    necessary for any man to be my adversary upon the account of\r\n    personal injuries or provocations. And as for any whom either\r\n    judgment or envy may invite to contend, that the things I have\r\n    communicated to the world deserved not so much applause as they\r\n    have had the luck to be entertained with; that shall make no\r\n    quarrel betwixt us: for perhaps I am myself as much of that\r\n    mind as he; and however I shall not scruple to profess myself\r\n    one of those who is more desirous to spend his time usefully,\r\n    than to have the glory of leaving nothing that was ever written\r\n    against himself unanswered; and who is more solicitous to\r\n    pursue the ways of discovering truth than to have it thought\r\n    that he never was so much subject to human frailties as to\r\n    miss it.”—ROBERT BOYLE: Preface to _A Defence of the Doctrine\r\n    touching the Spring and Weight of the Air_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral of the original Philosophical Society had migrated to Oxford\r\nbefore Robert Boyle joined them there. Dr. Wilkins had been appointed\r\nWarden of Wadham at the _Visitation and Purgation_ of the University in\r\n1648; Dr. Wallis, at the same time, had been made Savilian Professor of\r\nGeometry; and Dr. Goddard, of Wood Street celebrity, had become Warden\r\nof Merton. Robert Boyle does not seem to have been in Oxford during the\r\n_Encænia_ in July 1654. There is, at least, no mention of him in Evelyn’s\r\ndescription of “the civilities of Oxford” during that happy week; and\r\nthe friendship between Boyle and Evelyn, that was to last “neare fourty\r\nyeares,” was not to begin till a little later. But Evelyn has described\r\nOxford society exactly as it was when Robert Boyle entered it.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Evelyn arrived in Oxford “on the eve of the Act,”[188] and\r\nnext day, after midday dinner, “the Proctor opened the Act at St. Marie’s\r\n(according to custome) and the Prevaricators their drollery. Then the\r\nDoctors disputed. We supp’d at Wadham College.” On Sunday, Dr. French,\r\nCanon of Christ Church, the preacher at St. Mary’s, had his little fling\r\nat the Philosophers. “True wisdom,” he said, “was not to be had in the\r\nbooks of the Philosophers, but in the Scriptures alone.” He based his\r\nobservations on a text from St. Matthew xii. 42: “And, behold, a greater\r\nthan Solomon is here.” On Sunday afternoon the famous Independent, Dr.\r\nOwen, now “Cromwell’s Vice-Chancellor,” preached a wonderful sermon,\r\n“perstringing Episcopacy”—a sermon that Evelyn and some others present\r\nmust have found particularly trying to listen to. They dined that day\r\nwith Dr. Seth Ward, who had been one of the “Prevaricators” himself, when\r\nhe was at Cambridge, and was so alarmingly witty on the occasion that\r\nhe nearly lost his degree. And at night they supped in Balliol College\r\nHall—Evelyn’s own college.\r\n\r\nOn Monday they sat through the whole Act in St. Mary’s;[189]—the long\r\nspeeches of the Proctors, Vice-Chancellors and Professors, and the\r\ncreation of Doctors “by the cap, ring, kisse,” etc. The Inceptor[190]\r\nmade a most excellent oration, “abating his Presbyterian animosities\r\nwhich he could not withhold.” And after all this paraphernalia “there\r\nwere but 4 in Theologie and 3 in Medicine,” which was thought not bad,\r\n“the times considered.” And again there was a magnificent supper with\r\nEvelyn’s “dear and excellent friend,” Dr. Wilkins of Wadham.\r\n\r\nHappy days, two hundred and sixty years ago! There was music at All\r\nSouls, “voices and theorbos,” performed by “ingenious scholars.” And Dr.\r\nBarlow, the learned Librarian,[191] took them over the Bodleian, and\r\nshowed them all the treasures, including the 800-years-old manuscript\r\nof the Venerable Bede. The Divinity School vied with the Physical and\r\nAnatomical School in entertaining the visitors; and, at St. John’s,\r\nthe Library was almost eclipsed by poor Laud’s gift of mathematical\r\ninstruments, and by “2 skeletons, finely cleaned and put together.” New\r\nCollege Chapel, much to Evelyn’s satisfaction, was still _in statu quo_,\r\n“notwithstanding the scrupulosities of the times”; and at Christ Church\r\nthey saw the “Office of Henry VIII,” the gift of Cardinal Wolsey, with\r\nits wonderful miniatures and gilding, and the famous painted windows\r\nof the Cathedral, now “much abused.” In Magdalen Chapel, everything\r\nwas in its “pontificall order,” except that the Altar had been “turn’d\r\ntable-wise;” and there the famous musician, Mr. Gibbon, kindly played to\r\nthem upon the double organ. The Physick garden was visited, “where the\r\nsensitive plant was shewed us for a greate wonder.” Canes, olives and\r\nrhubarb grew there, “but no extraordinary curiosities, besides very good\r\nfruit, which, when the ladys had tasted, we return’d in our coach to our\r\nlodgings.”\r\n\r\nAnd the _Encænia_ festivities wound up with midday dinner at Wadham. “We\r\nall din’d at that most obliging and universally-curious Dr. Wilkins’s\r\nat Wadham College.” There, after dinner, they were shown the Warden’s\r\nnew transparent beehives, from which the honey could be drawn without\r\ndestroying the bees, and Evelyn was presented with an empty hive to\r\ncarry back with him to his own garden at Deptford. Mr. Christopher Wren,\r\nthat “prodigious young scholar,” that “miracle of a youth,” was of the\r\ncompany; and everybody wandered at will among Dr. Wilkins’s scientific\r\nand mechanical curiosities, conic sections, magnets, thermometers,\r\n“way-wisers,”[192] and all the rest, in the upper rooms and gallery of\r\nthe Warden’s lodging.\r\n\r\nThe Warden, it may be observed, was still a bachelor: it was not till two\r\nyears later that he married Cromwell’s sister. At the time of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Evelyn’s visit to Oxford, that lady was still Mrs. French, wife of\r\nthe worthy Canon of Christ Church, who had preached on the text, “Behold,\r\na greater than Solomon is here!”\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the Oxford of 1654 that was to welcome Robert Boyle. He\r\nhad evidently been there, looking about him, during his flying visit from\r\nIreland in 1653; and Lady Ranelagh—an experimentalist too in her own\r\nway—had gone to Oxford afterwards to inspect the lodgings selected by her\r\nbrother.[193]\r\n\r\n    “MY BROTHER,\r\n\r\n    “It has pleased God to bring us safe to Oxford, and I am lodged\r\n    at Mr. Crosse’s, with design to be able to give you from\r\n    experience an account which is the warmer room; and indeed I am\r\n    satisfied with neither of them, as to that point, because the\r\n    doors are placed so just by the chimnies, that if you have the\r\n    benefit of the fire you must venture having the inconvenience\r\n    of the wind, which yet may be helped in either by a folding\r\n    skreen; and then I think that which looks into the garden\r\n    will be the more comfortable, though he have near hanged, and\r\n    intends to matt, that you lay in before. You are here much\r\n    desired, and I could wish you here as soon as you can: for I\r\n    think you would have both more liberty and more conversation\r\n    than where you are, and both these will be necessary, both for\r\n    your health and usefulness.”\r\n\r\nMr. Crosse was an apothecary, and his house was in the High Street,\r\nadjoining University College. He seems to have been recommended to Boyle\r\nas a convenient landlord, not only on account of Boyle’s own fickle\r\nhealth, but as one who might be useful to him in laboratory work. He was\r\na staunch Churchman, and a particular friend of John Fell, the son of\r\nthe famous old Royalist Dean of Christ Church, who had been ejected at\r\nthe Visitation of 1648. Many scenes have been enacted in Christ Church\r\nquadrangle, but none more melodramatic than the ejection of Mrs. Fell\r\nand her family after the Dean himself had been carried off in custody to\r\nLondon. Mr. and Mrs. Evelyn must have shaken their heads indeed if they\r\nwere shown the identical spot in the Quad where Mrs. Fell and her lady\r\nfriends had been deposited, having chosen to be forcibly carried out,\r\nrather than voluntarily walk out, of the Deanery. John Fell, the son,\r\na student of Christ Church, had been ejected too, but he lived on in\r\nOxford; and one of his sisters married Dr. Willis, the physician, who set\r\nup in practice in a house in Merton Street, opposite to Merton College.\r\nIn a room in this house, thanks to John Fell and his brother-in-law Dr.\r\nWillis, with one or two more strong Churchmen, the Services of the Church\r\nwere to be privately maintained through all the years of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nDid Robert Boyle, Geneva-bred, make one of the little semi-forbidden\r\ncongregation of men and women that gathered in Dr. Willis’s house for\r\nservice and Communion? It is doubtful. Boyle’s own letter to John Durie,\r\nwritten in 1647, speaks his mind on denominational differences.[194]\r\n\r\n“It has long been,” he says, “as well my wonder as my grief, to see such\r\ncomparatively petty differences in judgement make such wide breaches and\r\nvast divisions in affection. It is strange that men should rather be\r\nquarrelling for a few trifling opinions, wherein they dissent, than to\r\nembrace one another for those many fundamental truths wherein they agree.\r\nFor my own part, in some two or three and forty months that I spent in\r\nthe very town of Geneva, as I never found that people discontented with\r\ntheir own Church government (the gallingness of whose yoke is the grand\r\nscarecrow that frights us here) so could I never observe in it any such\r\ntranscendent excellency as could oblige me either to bolt Heaven against,\r\nor open Newgate for, all those that believe they may be saved under\r\nanother....”\r\n\r\nEvelyn, who knew Robert Boyle intimately for nearly forty years, was of\r\nopinion that he “held the same free thoughts,” in matters of religion\r\nand religious discipline, “which he had of Philosophy.” He practised\r\nChristianity “without noise, dispute, or determining.” He owned no master\r\nin religion but the Divine Author of it; and, what is more, he owned “no\r\nreligion but primitive, no rule but Scripture, no law but right reason;\r\nfor the rest allways conformable to the present settlement, without any\r\nsort of singularity.”[195]\r\n\r\nOnly once is Robert Boyle known to have been persuaded to enter a\r\nconventicle. Curiosity led him, on one occasion, to Sir Henry Vane’s\r\nhouse, to hear the great man preach “in a large thronged room a long\r\nsermon.”[196] The text was from Daniel xii. 2: “And many of them that\r\nsleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and\r\nsome to shame and everlasting contempt.” Looking, from a modern point of\r\nview, to the possibilities of such a text on the Resurrection, it is a\r\nlittle disappointing to learn that Mr. Boyle stood up at the end of Sir\r\nHenry Vane’s discourse and submitted, in his gentlest Oxford manner, that\r\nthe preacher had suffered the meaning to “_evaporate_ into Allegory.” Sir\r\nHenry Vane was at this time at the very height of his authority in the\r\nState; and Robert Boyle, telling the story to Sir Peter Pett, explained\r\nthat Sir Henry’s congregation that day was composed of “dependants\r\non him, and expectants from him,” who would never have dreamed of\r\nquestioning his interpretations of Scripture, whatsoever they might have\r\nbeen. “But I,” said Boyle, “having no little awes of that kind upon me,\r\nthought myself bound to enter the lists with him as I did, that the sense\r\nof the Scriptures might not be depraved.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Birch, Sir Henry Vane had the last word. He had recognised\r\nin his critic the celebrated Mr. Robert Boyle; and when Mr. Boyle sat\r\ndown, Sir Henry assured him and the rest of his audience that he had\r\nonly intended his remarks on the words of Daniel to be in the way of\r\n_occasional reflections_.[197]\r\n\r\nBut there was another little congregation, which met in an upper\r\nroom in Oxford; a room in the house of the obliging and universally\r\ncurious Dr. Wilkins of Wadham. This was the weekly meeting of the\r\nInvisibles; the “learned Junto,” as Evelyn has dubbed them; a society\r\nwhich may be described as non-militant and non-party, and was\r\ncertainly non-sectarian—the Oxford branch of the original Invisible\r\nor Philosophical College, begun in London in 1645, before Wilkins and\r\nWallis and Goddard removed to Oxford. The Oxford branch kept up a regular\r\ncorrespondence with the London Society; and after a time, when Wilkins\r\nforsook Oxford for Cambridge, the weekly meetings of the Invisibles were\r\ntransferred from Wadham to Robert Boyle’s own rooms.\r\n\r\nAnd what a brilliant little “learned Junto” it was, in spite of the\r\nscrupulosities of the times! There was Wilkins himself, an Oxford man\r\nby birth, son of the Oxford goldsmith with the “very mechanicall hands”\r\nand a head that “ran much on perpetuall motion.” Wilkins was a man of\r\nabout forty, “lustie, strong-groune, well-sett and broad-shouldered.” His\r\nmanners were courteous, as became a man who had been Chaplain to Charles\r\nI’s nephew, the Prince Palatine, elder brother of Prince Rupert. A\r\nParliament-man himself, Wilkins had taken the Covenant and the Wardenship\r\nof Wadham, and his Theological Degree. Under his tolerant rule, Wadham\r\nwas flourishing, still patronised by some of the great “Malignant”\r\nfamilies of England: Dr. Wilkins’s cheerful tolerance was greasing all\r\nwheels. And meanwhile the Warden himself was the life and spirit of the\r\nNew Philosophy at Oxford—known, not only for his universal curiosity and\r\nirresistible manners, but as a writer of books. Had he not, as early as\r\n1638, when still quite a young man, attempted to prove that the Moon\r\nmight be a habitable world? And had he not, to a third edition, added the\r\nbold hypothesis, that the Moon might one day be reached “by volitation”?\r\nAnd in 1640 he had propounded in print the probability that this Earth\r\nitself was a planet. Clearly, the Warden was before his time; and many\r\nthings besides the consciences of young cavalier-manhood were safe in his\r\nkeeping.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was Dr. Wallis, the mathematician, since 1649 Savilian\r\nProfessor of Geometry. Wallis was about thirty-eight; a man of “moderate\r\nprinciples,” robust and energetic, with a serene temper that was “not\r\neasily ruffled,” but all the same a man who could hit out from the\r\nshoulder when he wanted to; as he did when he carried on his famous\r\ncontroversy with Dr. Hobbes. Wallis, as a believer in the New Philosophy,\r\nwas to be among the first men to “maintain the circulation of the\r\nblood.” But the particular feat which had made Wallis’s fortune, some\r\nyears before he went to Oxford, was a feat in “cryptologie.” In December\r\n1642 he was private chaplain to a great family in London; and one\r\nevening at supper a cypher letter had arrived, which brought important\r\npolitical news. The Chaplain, in two hours, succeeded in deciphering\r\nit; and after that he seems to have become “cryptologist-in-chief” to\r\nthe Parliamentarian Army: he is said to have had the deciphering of the\r\nKing’s private correspondence taken at the battle of Naseby. He held\r\nsuccessive City livings, was Secretary to the Westminster Assembly, and\r\none of the founders of the Invisible Society. And in 1649—a married man,\r\nthen—he went to Oxford as Savilian Professor of Geometry and one of the\r\nmost vigorous of the “learned Junto.”\r\n\r\nDr. Goddard of Wood Street was another of them. He was a Deptford man,\r\nson of a ship-builder; in 1654 a man of about thirty-seven. He had been\r\na student at Oxford, but had left it to study medicine abroad; and on\r\nhis return he had taken his medical degrees at Cambridge. Since 1646\r\nhe had been in London, a Fellow of the College of Physicians, living\r\nin Wood Street, where he entertained the Invisibles and manufactured\r\nhis _arcana_—the famous “Goddard’s drops” among them—in his own private\r\nlaboratory. As Cromwell’s physician, he had been with Cromwell in\r\nthe Irish and Scottish campaigns and in Cromwell’s severe illness in\r\nEdinburgh; and on his return with him to London, after the battle of\r\nWorcester, he had been appointed Warden of Merton.\r\n\r\nAnd living just opposite to Merton College was the Oxford-bred Willis,\r\nwith his strong royalist and episcopal sympathies, son-in-law of the\r\nstubborn old Dean of Christ Church and the lady who had been deposited\r\nin the quadrangle. Willis was a greater man in his own profession than\r\nthe inventor of “Goddard’s drops.” A firm believer in the New Philosophy,\r\nhe was to dissect many brains: a little bit of our cerebral geography\r\nis still known as the “Circle of Willis.” He is the man who discovered\r\n_diabetes mellitus_, and he may be called our first specialist in\r\ndiseases of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nThese, with the “miracle of a youth” Christopher Wren, then Fellow of\r\nAll Souls, and Seth Ward, the dangerously witty Savilian Professor\r\nof Astronomy, who lodged in the chamber over the gateway of Wadham,\r\nformed the “learned Junto” that welcomed Robert Boyle to Oxford. But\r\nthe Librarian of the Bodleian, Dr. Barlow,[198] must not be forgotten,\r\nthough he was not an Invisible, and not at all in favour of the New\r\nPhilosophy. Boyle, like many men of his time, was a student of divinity\r\nas well as of science; and he had come to Oxford partly, perhaps, on\r\naccount of the Orientalists there. For he was studying Hebrew, Greek,\r\nChaldee and Syriac, so as to be able to read the Scriptures for himself.\r\nHe had learnt by himself, he says, “as much Greek and Hebrew as sufficed\r\nto read the Old and New Testaments,” merely that he might do so in the\r\nHebrew and Greek, and thereby free himself from the necessity of relying\r\non a translation. And “a Chaldee grammar I likewise took the pains of\r\nlearning, to be able to understand that part of Daniel, and those few\r\nother portions of Scripture that were written in that tongue; and I have\r\nadded a Syriac grammar purely to be able one day to read the divine\r\ndiscourses of our Saviour in His own language.” And he quotes the “known\r\nsaying”—\r\n\r\n    “Though we stream waters not unpleasant think,\r\n    Yet with more gusto of the Spring we drink.”[199]\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Orientalists in Oxford—men like Pococke, Hyde and\r\nClarke—were to be among his new friends; but perhaps the most intimate\r\nof all was Dr. Barlow of the Bodleian. Barlow, logician and casuist, the\r\nman who saw both sides—to our modern ideas a bit of a trimmer—was yet “a\r\nman of prodigious learning and proportionall memory.” He knew exactly\r\n“what the fathers, schoolmen and casuists had said upon any question of\r\ndivinity or case of conscience”;[200] and with all his accomplishments,\r\nand in spite of his limitations, he was a delightful companion—“very\r\ncommunicative of his knowledge”—and Robert Boyle liked him.\r\n\r\nOne other man there was, a mere boy in 1654, but in a way, perhaps, the\r\nmost notable of them all: a little deformed man, with a pale, sharp,\r\nclever face, and lank dark hair that hung about his eyes; a man with a\r\nstooping figure and a quick step; a queer little solitary man who ate\r\nlittle and slept less, and worked restlessly and incessantly; a man,\r\neven in those young days, of a melancholy, jealous temper, warped by\r\nill-health. This was Robert Hooke, who had come to Oxford in 1653, when\r\nhe was eighteen, as servitor or chorister of Christ Church. He was the\r\nsickly, gifted son of a country parson,[201] and, too delicate to learn\r\nlessons, had used his little brain and fingers to make toy-ships that\r\nwould sail, toy-guns that would go off, and toy-clocks that would go\r\non. Then, for a time, he was with Dr. Busby at Westminster School; and\r\nat Christ Church his restless genius brought him to the notice of the\r\nInvisibles. Dr. Wilkins, with his pet dream of an excursion to the Moon,\r\nmust have been pleased to find a young man who could work out “thirty\r\nways of flying.” With Seth Ward’s help, Hooke studied mathematics and\r\nastronomy; and he worked for Willis in Willis’s own laboratory. It was\r\nWillis who recommended him to Boyle; and when Boyle set up a laboratory\r\nat Oxford, Hooke became Boyle’s personal assistant. “Boyle’s Law”[202]\r\nand “Hooke’s Law”[203] go together in the Handbooks of Physical Science.\r\nThe air-pump, the _Machina Boyleana_, invented for his own purposes by\r\nRobert Boyle, was “perfected” for him by Hooke. “Mr. Hooke,” wrote Boyle\r\nin the Introduction to his _Spring of the Air_,[204] “was with me when I\r\nhad these things under consideration.” The years spent working for and\r\nwith Robert Boyle were perhaps the happiest in Hooke’s life. His chatty\r\nletters to Boyle, after the two parted company and Hooke became Curator\r\nof the Royal Society, show real affection and trust. They begin “Ever\r\nhonoured Sir,” and end “Your Honour’s most affectionate, most faithful,\r\nand most humble Servant.”\r\n\r\nBut these things were not the work of a day or a year. The air-pump was\r\nonly the beginning, to enable its inventor to make a “just theory of\r\nthe air.” By this he “demonstrated its elasticity” and “that property\r\nalone was a means to find out abundance more.”[205] Boyle’s first\r\npublication, _New Experiments, physico-mechanical, touching the Spring\r\nof the Air and its Effects, made for the most part in a new Pneumatical\r\nEngine_, was printed at Oxford, 1660.[206] The dedicatory letter to his\r\nnephew, the young Lord Dungarvan, is dated from Beaconsfield, December\r\n20, 1659—where, in all probability, Boyle was spending Christmas with\r\nhis friend Edmund Waller, the Poet, at his house, Hall Barn. The book\r\nwas attacked by Franciscus Linus and by Hobbes; and Boyle answered his\r\n“objectors” in the _Defence of the Doctrine touching the Spring and\r\nWeight of the Air_, published 1662, answering more especially Franciscus\r\nLinus, as Dr. Wallis had taken Hobbes in hand.\r\n\r\nDo people who are not scientifically employed ever realise the absorbing,\r\nbaffling, fascinating work that goes on inside a chemical or a physical\r\nlaboratory? The “painful patience in delays,” the “faithfulness in little\r\nthings,” the flash of success, the hard wall of “negative result”? Who\r\nbut the “Scepticall Chymist” himself understands the Spirit of his\r\nResearch?\r\n\r\n“But it is scarce one day (or hour in the day) or night,” wrote Hartlib\r\nto Boyle, in 1659, “but my soul is crying out—\r\n\r\n    “‘Phosphore! redde diem; quid gaudia nostra moraris.\r\n        Phosphore! redde diem!’”[207]\r\n\r\nIt was in this spirit that Robert Boyle worked in his Oxford laboratory,\r\nthrough the years of the Protectorate and on to the coming of Charles\r\nII. Slowly and laboriously, and very gently, careful not to offend those\r\nfrom whom he dissented, he amassed and examined evidences that were to\r\nbreak down the old mistaken notions of the Greek and mediæval philosophy,\r\nand to build up—a very little way, perhaps, but on a new and sure\r\nfoundation—the mighty structure of physical and chemical science. Its\r\ngolden keys were to be handed over to Isaac Newton and Dalton, and a long\r\nand brilliant line of workers in experimental science. What if Robert\r\nBoyle, in the seventeenth century, spoke of phosphorus as “nocte-luca”\r\nand of gaseous elasticity as “spring of the air?” Dr. Wilkins, of Wadham,\r\nwas only then preparing his treatise on a _Real Character_.[208] As\r\nearly as 1647, Boyle himself, then only twenty, wrote to Hartlib: “If\r\nthe design of the _Real Character_ take effect, it will in good part\r\nmake amends to mankind for what their pride lost them at the tower of\r\nBabel.”[209] But even Dr. Wilkins’s _Real Character_ would scarcely\r\nhave been the vocabulary of to-day. Boyle’s Law, in whatever words he\r\nexpressed it, remains incontrovertible.[210] What if he just missed the\r\ndiscovery of Hydrogen after actually collecting it in a receiver? The\r\noversights of science are the inevitable dear companions of research.\r\nWhat if, after giving to science the definition of an element, as\r\ndistinguished from a mixture or compound, he could not go further, with\r\nthe means then at hand, by suggesting any one substance as elementary?\r\nNone the less, he had realised and stated a great natural fact, founding\r\nthereby a new era in science. The “Elements” of the Ancients, that had\r\nterrified him in childhood, were to be broken up; their secrets were to\r\nbe extorted from them, for the good of mankind. There is an echo of the\r\nold Genevan thunderstorm, and the older _Benedicite_, in Boerhaave’s\r\neulogium of Boyle—“to him we owe the secrets of fire, air, water,\r\nanimals, vegetables and frosts”; but in modern times, and in modern\r\nterms, Robert Boyle has had his recognition—\r\n\r\n“In the days of the early Greeks, the word ‘element’ was applied rather\r\nto denote a property of matter than one of its constituents. Thus, when\r\na substance was said to contain fire, air, water, and earth (of which\r\nterms a childish game, doubtless once played by all of us, is a relic),\r\nit probably meant that they partook of the nature of the so-called\r\nelements. Inflammability showed the presence of concealed fire; the\r\nescape of ‘airs’ when some substances are heated or when vegetable or\r\nanimal matter is distilled, no doubt led to the idea that these airs\r\nwere imprisoned in the matters from which they escaped; and hardness and\r\npermanence were ascribed to the presence of earth, while liquidity and\r\nfusibility were properties conveyed by the presence of concealed water.\r\nAt a later date the ‘Spagyrics’ added three ‘hypostatical principles’ to\r\nthe quadrilateral; these were ‘salt,’ ‘sulphur,’ and ‘mercury.’ The first\r\nconveyed solubility, and fixedness in fire; the second, inflammability,\r\nand the third, the power which some substances manifest of producing\r\na liquid, generally termed ‘phlegm,’ on application of heat, or of\r\nthemselves being converted into the liquid state by fusion.\r\n\r\n“It was Robert Boyle, in his _Skeptical Chymist_, who first controverted\r\nthese ancient and medieval notions, and who gave to the word ‘element’\r\nthe meaning that it now possesses—the constituent of a compound.”[211]\r\n\r\nSo the truths that Robert Boyle’s writings held forth have, in spite of\r\nopposition, established themselves, as he himself believed they would\r\nestablish themselves, in the minds of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPOLITICS AND PHILOSOPHY\r\n\r\n    “Died that arch rebell Oliver Cromwell, cal’d Protector.”—EVELYN’S\r\n    _Diary_, Sept. 3, 1658.\r\n\r\n    “And if the common charity allowed to dead men be exercised\r\n    towards him, in burying his faults in the grave with himself,\r\n    and keeping alive the memory of his virtues and great aims\r\n    and actions, he will be allowed to have his place amongst\r\n    the worthiest of men, ... I doubt his loss will be a growing\r\n    affliction upon these nations, and that we shall learn to value\r\n    him more by missing him—a perverseness of our nature that\r\n    teaches us, in every condition wherein we are, therewith to be\r\n    discontent, by undervaluing what we have, and overvaluing what\r\n    we have lost. I confess his performances reached not the making\r\n    good of his professions; but I doubt his performances may go\r\n    beyond the professions of those who may come after him.”—LADY\r\n    RANELAGH to LORD BROGHILL, from Youghal, Sept. 17, 1658.\r\n\r\n    “O human glory vain! O death! O wings!\r\n    O worthless world! O transitory things!\r\n    Yet dwelt that greatness in his shape decayed\r\n    That still, though dead, greater than death he laid,\r\n    And in his altered face you something feign\r\n    That threatens Death he yet will live again.”\r\n\r\n                                ANDREW MARVELL, “A Poem upon the Death\r\n                                of his Late Highness the Lord Protector.”\r\n\r\n“My Lady Molkin,” Charles Rich’s wife, now lived almost always at\r\ndelicious Leeze. For Mary had long ago become devout, and was surrounded\r\nby the Earl of Warwick’s chaplains. The story of her conversion has been\r\ntold by herself.[212] When she was scarcely more than one-and-twenty,\r\nher little son, her only child—“which I then doated on with great\r\nfondness”—had fallen dangerously ill. In her agony of mind, Mary, like\r\nher brother Robyn in the thunderstorm, had made a vow to God. If he would\r\nrestore her child to her, she would become “a new creature.” The little\r\nboy recovered, and Mary “began to find in myselfe a greate desire to go\r\ninto the country, which I never remember before to have had, thinking\r\nit allways the saddest thing that could be when we were to remove.” It\r\nwas indeed a great change for the little lady who had lived in “constant\r\ncrowds of company” ever since she had left the care of Lady Clayton\r\nin Cork. Even after her marriage with Charles Rich and her separation\r\nfrom Frank’s frivolous little wife Betty, Mary had remained “stedfastly\r\nset against being a Puritan.” But after hearing the great Usher preach\r\n“against Plays,” she had given up going to see them acted, and her sister\r\nRanelagh had encouraged her in her new course of life. Moreover, Dr.\r\nWalker, the household chaplain at Leeze, had preached “very awakingly and\r\nwarmly”; and though some of the Warwick family were inclined to laugh at\r\nher, Mary pursued her own way, stealing from them into the wilderness at\r\nLeeze, and keeping to her quiet life of reading, meditation, and prayer.\r\n\r\nShe was, however, at Warwick House in Holborn towards the end of\r\n1648, after Robert Boyle had finished writing his _Seraphick Love_ at\r\nLeeze; and in Holborn Mary fell ill of the smallpox. Lady Ranelagh\r\nwas then at her house in Pall Mall. She had been fortunate enough to\r\nescape smallpox, but she was not afraid to sit with her little sister,\r\nwho had been isolated in Warwick House. The great Dr. Wright was in\r\nattendance—“Cromwell’s Physician,” the man afterwards chosen by the\r\nCouncil to be sent, with Dr. Bates and an apothecary, to consult with\r\nDr. Goddard when Cromwell was so ill in Edinburgh. Mary was scarcely\r\nconvalescent when the news was brought to her sick-room of “that\r\nbarbarous and unheard-of wicked action of beheading Charles I.”[213]\r\n\r\nA year or two later, while Robert Boyle was in Ireland, Mary fell ill\r\nagain; this time “strangely and extremely ill” at delicious Leeze.\r\nPoor Charles Rich once more sent post-haste for Lady Ranelagh, who set\r\nout from London the very next morning. She found My Lady Molkin in an\r\nextraordinary condition, to all appearances well enough, but, “her\r\ndisease lying more in stupidness than pain,” she was “no more joyed” to\r\nsee her sister. It was “a mortifying encounter”; Mary was “the carcase\r\nof a friend,” her “soul gone as to any rational use she had of it”; her\r\n“kindness was dead.”\r\n\r\nNerves were little understood in those days. The Essex doctor diagnosed\r\nMary’s illness as “a spice of the palsy.” The Warwick family talked of\r\n“fumes of the spleen.” Dr. Wright held a more modern opinion, which\r\nhe confided to Lady Ranelagh; but he agreed with the opinion of the\r\ncountry doctor that the disease was “very inward and hidden”; and Lady\r\nRanelagh wrote to her brother Robert in Ireland that they were “all going\r\nblindfold towards a cure.”[214] Charles Rich and Mary’s mother-in-law had\r\nbeen “very obligingly careful of, and kind to, her”; and as soon as Mary\r\nwas well enough Lady Ranelagh carried her off to London, where, under\r\nher sister’s care and Dr. Wright’s, she was once more restored to health.\r\nLady Ranelagh was, in Mary’s own words, “the most useful and best friend\r\nfor soul and body that ever any person, I think, had.”[215]\r\n\r\nSomebody else thought so too. In 1655 Lady Ranelagh had known Milton\r\nfor ten years. For the last six years Milton had been Latin Secretary\r\nto the Council of State; and he was now living in the “pretty garden\r\nhouse” in Petty France, Westminster, next door to my Lord Scudamore,\r\nand not far from Lady Ranelagh’s house in the Old Mall. If only as the\r\ngreat Republican pamphleteer, one of the chief State officials under\r\nthe Protectorate, Milton was a very eminent and important man, visited\r\nby many “persons of quality” besides Lady Ranelagh, and by all the\r\nlearned foreigners of note who passed through London. Some of the old\r\nHartlib-Durie circle of the Aldersgate and Barbican days, with Milton’s\r\npupils, Henry Lawrence and Cyriack Skinner, came about Milton almost\r\ndaily; and among his more recent friends was the Agent for Bremen, Mr.\r\nHenry Oldenburg. Durie himself, who was Keeper of the library at St.\r\nJames’s, was a near neighbour. Milton’s wife, poor Mary Powell, and\r\ntheir little son had been about three years dead; and the widower had\r\nbeen left with three little girls, the youngest but a month or two old\r\nat the mother’s death. In 1655 they were nine, seven, and three years\r\nold, and were being brought up, in strange, motherless fashion, in the\r\nhouse in Petty France; while Milton himself, with the help of readers\r\nand amanuenses, pursued his work for the Council through all the\r\ndifficulties of his blindness. For Milton was now quite blind.[216]\r\n\r\nIt was to visit this Milton—the Latin Secretary, blind among his\r\nbooks—that Lady Ranelagh used so frequently to knock at the door of the\r\npretty garden-house in Petty France. Her boy, Dick Jones, who was now\r\nfifteen, had, like his cousin young Lord Barrymore, been one of Milton’s\r\npupils, and was probably at this very time taking his private lessons\r\nwith Mr. Milton in preparation for a year at Oxford—to be followed by\r\na foreign tour—with Henry Oldenburg as his tutor. And Lady Ranelagh\r\nherself, fired, perhaps, by her brother Robert’s study of Oriental\r\nlanguages, and under Milton’s influence, was taking lessons in Hebrew of\r\na Scottish divine who lodged in Holborn.\r\n\r\nA year later—some time in October 1656—Dick Jones and Henry Oldenburg\r\nwere settled at Oxford, where Dick’s cousins, the Earl of Cork’s two\r\nsons, were already at the University,[217] with their tutor, Peter\r\ndu Moulin, in attendance on them; and all five were basking in the\r\npersonality of the virtuoso-uncle, Mr. Robert Boyle. Henry Oldenburg and\r\nPeter du Moulin were both to become _protégés_ of Robert Boyle.[218]\r\nHenry Oldenburg especially was to link himself with the Invisibles and\r\nthe future Royal Society; and it was probably in the Oxford laboratory\r\nthat Henry Oldenburg won Robert Boyle’s admiration, and that Dick Jones\r\nfirst learned to dabble in experimental science and earned for himself\r\nhis uncle’s _sobriquet_, “Pyrophilus.”[219]\r\n\r\nMeantime, Henry Oldenburg and Dick Jones had kept up a correspondence\r\nwith Mr. Milton in London, and Milton had written kindly to his\r\n“well-beloved Richard.” Milton’s letters to Dick Jones are in Latin,\r\nand there is more than a touch of the pedagogue in their tone. It seems\r\nlikely, in the light of after events, that the brilliant Dick had already\r\ncaused his mother some uneasiness of mind, and that she hoped much from\r\nthis year at Oxford, with her brother Robert Boyle as mentor, before Dick\r\nand Henry Oldenburg set out on their foreign tour. In October 1656 Lady\r\nRanelagh was herself in Oxford: she had taken it on her way to Ireland,\r\nwhither she was bound on a long visit, with her daughters, servants, and\r\neight horses.[220] And she had brought with her to Oxford a letter from\r\nMr. Milton to her son Dick. The blind secretary, left behind in London,\r\nwas missing Lady Ranelagh’s frequent kindly knock at the door of the\r\ngarden-house in Petty France—\r\n\r\n“And now your most excellent mother,” Milton wrote to Dick Jones at\r\nOxford, “on her way to Ireland, whose departure ought to be a matter of\r\nno ordinary regret to both of us (for to me also she has stood in the\r\nplace of all kith and kin), carries you this letter herself.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact Milton must have been thinking of his own domestic\r\naffairs when he wrote to Dick Jones, for he was to marry his second wife,\r\nKatharine Woodcock, shortly after Lady Ranelagh’s departure. But the\r\nwords “to me also” carry a special meaning; for Lord Ranelagh, between\r\nwhom and his wife there had long been estrangement, can have taken little\r\npart in his son’s upbringing. The mother had been left to bring up her\r\nchildren—to stand for them, as for Milton, in the place of “all kith and\r\nkin.” And, after all, Dick was not a good boy—he was but the son of his\r\nfather.[221]\r\n\r\nLord Broghill had been quartered lately in Edinburgh. He had remained\r\nin Ireland for some time after Cromwell had re-conquered it. He had sat\r\nin Cromwell’s Parliament of 1654 as Member for Cork, and he was Member\r\nfor Cork and Edinburgh in the Parliament of 1656. In 1655 he had been\r\nappointed President of Council (Head of the Civil Establishment of the\r\nnew Government in Scotland), with his headquarters in Edinburgh; and\r\naccording to Baillie he was more popular in Scotland than “all the\r\nEnglish that ever were among us.” But the Scottish atmosphere was not to\r\nBroghill’s liking, and in 1657 he was back in London, where he was to\r\nprove himself one of the most energetic of Cromwell’s supporters in the\r\nlast stage of the Protectorate.\r\n\r\nHis philosopher-brother, all this time, had held himself studiously\r\naloof from political parties and “affairs.” Cromwell was approaching his\r\nzenith when Robert Boyle went to Oxford. The great warship, newly built\r\nin the spring of 1655—a ship of 1000 tons burthen, carrying 96 brass\r\nguns—had for the figurehead in her prow Oliver on horseback, trampling\r\nsix nations underfoot. Scot, Irishman, Dutchman, Frenchman, Spaniard, and\r\nEnglishman, in their several national garbs, lay under his horse’s hoofs.\r\n“A Fame,” wrote Evelyn in his _Diary_, after inspecting the ship as she\r\nlay in the dock, “held a laurel over his insulting head: the word, _God\r\nwith us_.”\r\n\r\nPoor Evelyn, bereft of his Church services, lamenting that there was\r\n“no more notice taken of Christmas Day in our Churches,” smuggling a\r\nClergyman into his house at Deptford to administer the Sacrament, or\r\nstealing up to receive it in Dr. Wild’s lodging in Fleet Street, could\r\nyet not resist going to look at the new warship in the dock; to hear Dr.\r\nWilkins preach before the Lord Mayor in St. Paul’s, a very common-sense\r\nsermon on the superiority of obedience to sacrifice; to stare at the\r\nproud and melancholy Quakers who were hunger-striking in prison; and even\r\nto peep into Whitehall itself, now “very glorious and well-furnished” for\r\nthe Protector. It was no doubt Evelyn’s many-sidedness that made life\r\nbearable in what to him was “a dangerous and treacherous time.” Ships\r\nand prisons and persecuted clergy, rare jewels, miniatures, “achates\r\nand intalias,” carved wood, other people’s houses and gardens and\r\npicture-galleries, the “incomparable pieces” that he loved to look at,\r\nand the incomparable performances of violin and theorbo and human voice\r\nthat he loved to listen to—these were the things that made Evelyn happy,\r\nand his _Diary_ so fascinating. Above all, perhaps, his passion was for\r\n“curiosities.” He was almost as “universally curious” as Dr. Wilkins of\r\nWadham himself. Those were red-letter days when he could examine a clock,\r\nwhose sole balance was a crystal ball sliding on parallel wires, or a\r\n_Terrella_, showing all the magnetical deviations, or an elixir, or a\r\nperspective, or a way-wiser, or the charring of sea-coal; or when he had\r\na glimpse into the “elaboratory” of an aristocratic friend, or a gossip\r\nabout all and sundry with worthy Mr. Hartlib or Dr. Wilkins himself. It\r\nmay have been Wilkins or it may have been Hartlib who, in the spring of\r\n1656, brought Boyle and Evelyn together.[222] The good Hartlib was a\r\nfriend of both. Robert Boyle was then in London; but whether or no to\r\nhear Wilkins’s sermon in St. Paul’s on the Superiority of Conformity\r\nto Sacrifice, is not recorded. In April, at any rate, the acquaintance\r\nbetween Evelyn and Boyle had begun, and Boyle and Wilkins were guests\r\nat a little dinner-party given by Evelyn at Sayes Court. It was then\r\nthat Evelyn presented Wilkins with his “rare burning-glass,” in return,\r\nprobably, for the beehive that Wilkins had given him during that visit to\r\nOxford in 1654. And after dinner, the little company adjourned to look at\r\nColonel Blount’s “new-invented plows.”\r\n\r\nThe friendship so pleasantly begun was to last for nearly forty years.\r\nIt is to be remembered that Robert Boyle’s mother and Mrs. Evelyn’s\r\nfamily[223] were related; that Sayes Court had belonged to the Brownes,\r\nand had come to Evelyn through his wife; and that little Hodge, Robert\r\nBoyle’s eldest brother, had many years before died at Sayes Court,\r\nand been buried in Deptford Church. Boyle and Evelyn were men of very\r\ndifferent natures; but they had memories, sympathies, and friends in\r\ncommon. Their intercourse soon grew “reciprocal and familiar”; and it is\r\nto Evelyn we owe the finest and most intimate description that exists\r\nof Robert Boyle.[224] Boyle was to return to Experimental Philosophy at\r\nOxford, where the lion and the lamb proverbially lay down together then\r\nas now;—the lion, as it has been wittily said, sometimes with the lamb in\r\nits inside. And Evelyn and his family at Sayes Court were to live on as\r\npleasantly as possible, “the times considered.”\r\n\r\nIn 1657 the Protectorate was in its last stage. In June, Cromwell was\r\n“his Highness,” a monarch in arbitrariness and splendour, with all the\r\nformalities of purple velvet, Bible, sword, and sceptre—everything,\r\nindeed, except the Crown, and a good many things that the Crown itself\r\nmight not have had. Lord Broghill, back in London, and one of Cromwell’s\r\nHouse of Lords, had been one of the prime movers in the _Petition and\r\nAdvice_, which pressed Cromwell to accept the Kingship; and report says,\r\nthat when that failed, Broghill’s “well-armed head” was filled with an\r\neven bolder project, an alliance between Cromwell’s youngest daughter\r\nFrances and Charles II. This, too, came to nothing; and in November 1657\r\nCromwell’s daughter Frances was married to the old Earl of Warwick’s\r\ngrandson, son of Charles Rich’s elder brother. This boy died in the\r\nsickly spring of 1658, four months after his wedding; and the old Earl\r\nof Warwick’s death in April left Charles Rich heir-presumptive to the\r\nEarldom of Warwick.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1657-8 had been, according to Evelyn, the severest winter\r\nthat any man alive had known in England. “The crowes feete were frozen\r\nto their prey, Islands of ice inclos’d both fish and fowl frozen....” It\r\nwas on Christmas Day that Mr. and Mrs. Evelyn went into London to receive\r\nthe Communion in Exeter Chapel, and that the Chapel was surrounded by\r\nsoldiers and the communicants surprised and taken prisoners—the soldiers’\r\nmuskets pointed at them as they knelt before the Altar. The Evelyns\r\nwere allowed to go home; and a month after this memorable Communion, in\r\nJanuary 1658, they lost their little prodigy of an eldest son—just five\r\nyears old—who died of a quartan ague. “Such a child I never saw: For such\r\na child I blesse God in whose bosome he is!” He was buried in Deptford\r\nChurch; and a week or two later their youngest child followed him, “after\r\n7 weeks languishing at nurse, breeding teeth, and ending in a dropsie.”\r\nThe season was still very cold and sickly, and in May a public Fast was\r\nordered “to avert an epidemical sicknesse, very mortal this Spring.”\r\nBut in spite of the Fast, June came in with an extraordinary storm of\r\nhail and rain, “the season as cold as winter, the wind Northerly nere 6\r\nmoneths.” It may have been in consequence of this epidemic, following\r\non an unhealthy winter, that Hartlib was even more than usually curious\r\nabout the ingredients of certain _arcana_—or medical “secrets” as he\r\nalways called them. He mentioned one, in particular, in a letter to\r\nRobert Boyle, dated February 2, 1658. Hartlib himself had been a sufferer\r\nfrom the “extremity of the frosty weather.”\r\n\r\nIt appears from Hartlib’s letter to Boyle that Mr. Milton had in his\r\npossession a “secret” which Hartlib, and apparently Boyle also, was at\r\nthis time anxious to obtain. “I shall not be wanting,” wrote Hartlib to\r\nBoyle, “to obtain that secret which hath been imparted to Mr. Milton.\r\nIt may be the public gentleman, that sent it unto him, will let me\r\nhave a copy, in case the other should not come off readily with the\r\ncommunication of it. But if yours[225] would ask it from Mr. Milton, I am\r\nconfident he would not deny it.”\r\n\r\nIf by “yours” Hartlib meant Lady Ranelagh, that lady was still in\r\nIreland, on difficult domestic business of her own, and far away from the\r\ngarden-house in Petty France; and Dick Jones and Henry Oldenburg were on\r\ntheir “peregrination” abroad. Whether or no Mr. Milton was induced to\r\npart with his prescription remains unrelated. Hartlib’s letter to Boyle\r\nwas written on February 2, and only a few days later Milton’s second\r\nwife died—the baby girl she had borne him in October was to live on into\r\nMarch. That spring, in his darkness and solitude, Milton’s mind was\r\nturning once more to his scheme of a _Paradise Lost_. It was not exactly\r\na time for Mr. Hartlib to trouble him about a prescription.\r\n\r\nThe news of Cromwell’s illness fell like a thunderbolt on the nation. The\r\npeople about him had known that all through that cold, unhealthy summer\r\nof 1658 the burdens of State, heavy as they were, were not for Cromwell\r\nso hard to bear as the sight of a much-loved daughter’s sufferings. The\r\nCromwell family were gathered round Lady Claypole’s couch when she died\r\nat Hampton Court on August 6. Cromwell himself was ill, even then, though\r\nfor another fortnight his illness was as much as possible concealed, and\r\nhe was able intermittently to attend to State business, and on some days\r\neven to show himself, riding with his Life Guards in the Park at Hampton\r\nCourt. On August 21 it became known that the Protector was very ill of an\r\nague, which his Physicians called a “bastard tertian”; but on the 24th\r\nthey were able to remove their patient from Hampton Court to Whitehall,\r\nwhere again, between the ague-fits, till August 28, the Iron Man\r\ntransacted public business. On that day the fits of ague changed their\r\ncharacter; the “bastard tertian” had changed to “double tertian”—with\r\ntwo very exhausting ague-fits in the twenty-four hours: His Highness’s\r\nstrength was failing. Next day, Sunday the 29th, prayers were offered up\r\nin the Churches.\r\n\r\n“And then came that extraordinary Monday (August 30, 1658) which lovers\r\nof coincidence have taken care to remember as the day of most tremendous\r\nhurricane that ever blew over London and England. From morning to night\r\nthe wind raged and howled, emptying the streets, unroofing houses,\r\ntearing up trees in the parks, foundering ships at sea, and taking even\r\nFlanders and the coasts of France within its angry whirl. The storm was\r\nfelt, within England, as far as Lincolnshire, where, in the vicinity of\r\nan old manor house, a boy of fifteen years of age, named Isaac Newton,\r\nwas turning it to account, as he afterwards remembered, by jumping first\r\nwith the wind, and then against it, and computing its force by the\r\ndifference of the distances....”[226]\r\n\r\nCromwell died on September 3, and the news had reached Ireland by\r\nSeptember 17. On September 17 Lady Ranelagh, in Youghal, wrote the long\r\nletter to her brother Lord Broghill, an extract from which stands at\r\nthe head of this chapter. The man who a few days before “shooke all\r\nEurope by his fame and forces” was dead; and with his death the face\r\nof British history was changed. In Cromwell Lady Ranelagh herself had\r\nlost a generous and powerful friend; and in the last part of her letter\r\nshe reverts, sadly enough, to what she calls “the penny half-penny of\r\nmy own particular.” For Cromwell had helped her not only with her Irish\r\nestates, but with her recalcitrant husband. “His now Highness,” she says\r\nof Richard Cromwell, “seems not to me so proper a person to summon my\r\nlord[227] or to deal with him in such an affair as his father did, from\r\nwhose authority and severety against such practices as my lord’s are, I\r\nthought the utmost would be done that either persuasions or advice would\r\nhave effected upon my lord ... soe, as there being little hopes left of\r\nbringing him to reason either here or there, I thinke my present work is\r\nto seeke a maintenance for me and my children without him.”\r\n\r\nShe had consented, she says, some time before, to “retyre” among her own\r\nfriends from “my lord’s oppressions”; and she can now “remove lightly”,\r\nnot having much wealth to gather together. Owing to “the unreasonableness\r\nof my lord” her children “are neither like to be preferred in marriage\r\nnor prepared for the narrow condition their father’s obstinacy condemns\r\nthem to live in.” She wishes people to know that “I left not my lord\r\nupon humour, but necessety, and that in soe doing I sought privacy and\r\nsubmitted to scarsety than persued a croud or designed aboundance to\r\nmyselfe.”[228]\r\n\r\nThe friendship between Boyle and Evelyn was at this time ripening in\r\nletters—letters about books, and the shapes of fruits, and recipes for\r\nvarnish, and many other things—which passed between Evelyn at Sayes\r\nCourt, and Boyle at Oxford. In one of these letters[229] Evelyn imparted\r\nto Boyle his pet scheme of a resident “philosophic mathematic college,”\r\nto be built some five-and-twenty miles out of London, where “some\r\ngentlemen whose geniuses are greatly suitable might form themselves into\r\na Society,” and live “somewhat after the manner of Carthusians.” Evelyn\r\nhad planned it out to the smallest detail—the thirty or forty acres\r\nof land to be acquired, with “tall wood” and upland pasture, “sweetly\r\nirrigated.” The house itself was to be a “goodly pavilion” containing\r\ngallery, refectory, library, withdrawing-room, kitchen, larders,\r\nservice-rooms and what-not, all “well and nobly furnished”; and opposite\r\nto the house “towards the wood” was to be erected a “pretty chapel”\r\nand “six apartments or cells for members of the Society.” And then\r\nEvelyn, prince of gardeners, goes on to describe the “elaboratory” in\r\nthe grounds, with “a repository for rarities and things of nature”; the\r\naviary, dove-house, physic-garden, kitchen-garden, plantation of orchard\r\nfruit, stalls for one or two horses, and conservatory for tender plants.\r\nThe philosophers were to be allowed to play at bowls and chess, and\r\nwalk—presumably two and two—in the garden paths. And Mrs. Evelyn, paragon\r\nof wives, had cheerfully consented to go and live there, and allow her\r\nhusband to be a Carthusian, while she, located apparently in solitary\r\nglory in the Pavilion, reigned over the refectory and the domestic staff.\r\nThis last was to consist of “a chaplain well qualified,” an “ancient\r\nwoman to dress the meat,” a man to buy provisions and keep the garden and\r\nstable, and a boy to run about doing everything else.\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle must have smiled as he read Evelyn’s enthusiastic letter,\r\nculminating in its pseudo-Carthusian _Orders_—\r\n\r\n“At six in summer prayers in chapel. To study till half-an-hour after\r\neleven. Dinner in the refectory till one. Retire till four. Then called\r\nto conversation (if the weather invite) abroad, else in the refectory.\r\nThis never omitted but in case of sickness. Prayers at seven. To bed\r\nat nine. In the winter the same, with some abatements for the hours;\r\nbecause the nights are tedious, and the evening’s conversation more\r\nagreeable. This in the refectory. All Play interdicted, _sans_ bowls,\r\nchess, etc. Everyone to cultivate his own garden. One month in spring a\r\ncourse in the elaboratory on vegetables, etc. In the winter a month on\r\nother experiments. Every man to have a key of the elaboratory, pavilion,\r\nlibrary, repository, etc. Weekly fast. Communion once every fortnight, or\r\nmonth, at least. No stranger to be easily admitted to visit any of the\r\nSociety, but upon certain days weekly, and that only after dinner....\r\nEvery Thursday shall be a music-meeting at conversation hours....”\r\n\r\nAnd once a week every philosopher was to “render a public account of his\r\nstudies,” and every man was to wear “a decent habit or uniform”; and,\r\noh bliss! “one month in the year may be spent in London, or any of the\r\nUniversities, or in a perambulation for the public benefit.” How the\r\nPhilosophers would prance!\r\n\r\nThis was on September 3, 1659, the first anniversary of Cromwell’s\r\ndeath. A week or two later, Evelyn wrote again.[230] He had been reading\r\nBoyle’s _Seraphick Love_, probably in manuscript, since it did not\r\nappear in print till 1660. The “incomparable book” seemed to Evelyn to\r\nhave been “indicted with a pen snatched from the wing of a seraphim.” “I\r\nextremely loved you before,” he wrote, “but my heart is infinitely knit\r\nto you now.” And yet, the pity of it! There is a cry of appeal in poor\r\nEvelyn’s letter to his friend, and there is no further mention of any\r\nCarthusian College. The little cells, and the chess, and the bowls, and\r\nthe philosophers walking two and two along the garden paths are for the\r\nmoment forgotten; and in their places comes a shadowy procession of fair\r\nand virtuous women—\r\n\r\n“What think you, Sir, of _Alceste_, that ran into the funeral pile of her\r\nhusband? The goodness of _Aemilia_, the chastity of _Lucretia_, the faith\r\nof _Furia_, of _Portia_?... Take away this love, and the whole earth is\r\nbut a desert!”\r\n\r\nAs for St. Paul’s remarks, Evelyn thinks very little of them; they\r\nwere all very well for an itinerant apostle in a time of persecution,\r\nbut “he confesses he had no command from the Lord.” And what pious and\r\nstudious wives some of the philosophers have had! Take, for example,\r\n_Pudentilla_, who “held the lamp to her husband’s lucubrations.” And good\r\nMadame Grotius, and others; while, not to go abroad, in London itself,\r\n“the committee-chambers, the parliament-lobby,[231] are sad but evident\r\ntestimonies of the patience, and the address, the love, and the constancy\r\nof those gentle creatures....”\r\n\r\nIs there no hope that Mr. Boyle may relent, and realise that if Love be\r\nvirtuous it is seraphic? At least he may remember that in paradise, and\r\nin the ark, “there were but couples there, and every creature was in\r\nlove.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nManuscript copies of _Seraphick Love_ were evidently in circulation.\r\nA pirated and incorrect copy had been offered for sale to a London\r\nstationer, who had communicated with Mr. Boyle; and Boyle, who had\r\nlong refused, was persuaded at last to publish it himself. It may\r\nhave been in proof-form that Evelyn, in September 1659, read the\r\nlittle treatise—written eleven years before by a very sad young man at\r\ndelicious Leeze. Eleven years had not altered Mr. Boyle’s convictions;\r\nand _Seraphick Love_ was to be one of the most notable, if the least\r\ncharacteristic, publications of the “Annus Mirabilis.”[232]\r\n\r\nMeantime the year 1659 was to be memorable to another branch of the\r\nBoyle family. On May 30, Charles Rich’s elder brother, who had so\r\nrecently succeeded to the earldom, died; and Charles Rich and my Lady\r\nMolkin found themselves Earl and Countess of Warwick. Five days before,\r\nRichard Cromwell had abdicated. The months of Richard’s Protectorate\r\nhad been, as all the world knows, months of dire confusion. With one\r\nman’s death, the whole fabric of a great Republic had crumbled into\r\ndust. Lady Ranelagh came back to her house in the Mall to find a very\r\ndifferent London from the London she had left three years before. “The\r\nnation,” Evelyn has recorded in his _Diary_, “was in extreame confusion\r\nand unsettl’d, between the Armies and the Sectaries.” “Several Pretenders\r\nand Parties,” he wrote, “strive for the Government: all anarchy and\r\nconfusion; Lord, have mercy on us!”[233]\r\n\r\nAs long as it was possible, Lord Broghill seems to have supported\r\nRichard’s protectorate;[234] but before Richard’s abdication Broghill and\r\nCoote were back in Ireland, and Broghill in command of Munster and Coote\r\nin Connaught were both working for Charles II’s return. Early in 1660,\r\nMonk in England and Coote and Broghill in Ireland were in communication\r\nwith the Royal Orphan. Broghill’s letter to Charles was carried to Breda\r\nby the sweet-spirited Frank: it is said to have been in Charles’s hands\r\nbefore Monk’s emissary had done his work.[235] Broghill’s proposal,\r\nhowever, that Charles should land in Ireland proved superfluous. Monk’s\r\noffers were eagerly accepted. Sir Edward Montagu—afterwards Earl of\r\nSandwich—was sent to The Hague to bring back Charles II; and on May\r\n8, 1660, “after a most bloudy and unreasonable rebellion of neere 20\r\nyears,”[236] Charles II was proclaimed in London. On May 29, he was\r\nthere. Amid the blare of trumpets, 20,000 horse and foot brandished\r\ntheir swords and shouted aloud for joy. The pavements were strewn with\r\nflowers, the bells of the City rang out, the fountains poured out wine\r\namong the people. Ladies leaned over the windows and balconies: the\r\nLords and Gentlemen made a brave show in their rich velvets and cloth of\r\ngold. “I stood,” says Evelyn, “in the Strand, and beheld it, and bless’d\r\nGod!”[237]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATION AND THE ROYAL SOCIETY\r\n\r\n    “Thence to Whitehall; where, in the Duke’s chamber, the King\r\n    come and stayed an hour or two laughing at Sir W. Petty, who\r\n    was there about his boate,[238] and at Gresham College in\r\n    general; at which poor Petty was, I perceive, at some loss, but\r\n    did argue discreetly, and bear the unreasonable follies of the\r\n    King’s objections and other bystanders with great discretion;\r\n    and offered to take oddes against the King’s best boates,\r\n    but the King would not lay, but cried him down with words\r\n    only. Gresham College he mightily laughed at, for spending\r\n    time in weighing of ayre, and doing nothing else since they\r\n    sat.”—PEPYS’S _Diary_, February 1, 1664.\r\n\r\n    “Bacon, like Moses, led us forth at last,\r\n    The barren wilderness he past,\r\n    Did on the very border stand\r\n    Of the blest promis’d Land,\r\n    And from the Mountains-top of his Exalted Wit\r\n    Saw it himself and shew’d us it.\r\n    But life did never to one man allow\r\n    Time to discover Worlds and Conquer too:\r\n    ...\r\n    For who on things remote can fix his sight\r\n    That’s always in a Triumph or a Fight?”\r\n\r\n                         _Lines to the Royal Society_, by ABRAHAM COWLEY.\r\n\r\n            (Prefixed to the _History of the Royal Society of London_, by\r\n                                                      THOS. SPRAT, 1667.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo of the Boyle brothers were among the recipients of King’s Honours at\r\nthe Restoration: the old Earl would have been proud of his sons. “Dear\r\nBroghill,” who, with each shake of the political kaleidoscope, showed\r\nhimself like a bright central bit of glass, about which the smaller\r\npieces fell together into a new combination,—was created Earl of Orrery,\r\nwith a brilliant career of soldier-politician and dramatist before him.\r\nAs President of Munster, and one of the Lords Justices of Ireland, he\r\nwas to make his headquarters at Charleville, with frequent visits to\r\nEngland. And the sweet-spirited Frank, the boy hero of Liscarrol, became\r\nViscount Shannon, and a Privy Councillor. Not much is known of Frank’s\r\nafter life, except that he lived and brought up his family on his Irish\r\nestate at Shannon Park. He seems, following the example set by his\r\nliterary brothers, to have ventured, at least once, into print.[239] His\r\nwife, the “black Betty” of the letters, is better known to posterity than\r\nher husband, for she is remembered not only as Viscountess Shannon, the\r\nmother of Frank’s children, but as the brilliant sister of Tom Killigrew,\r\nthe wit and profligate, and as the mother of one of Charles II’s natural\r\ndaughters.[240]\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of the Royalist elder brother, Lord Cork, who had been\r\ndiligently nursing the family fortunes through the Protectorate, were\r\nnow so far reinstated that he was able to do for Charles II what the\r\nGreat Earl had done for Charles I. He assisted an impecunious king with\r\nsums of money; and in recognition of his services he was, in 1663, to\r\nbe created Earl of Burlington in the English Peerage. Presently, the\r\ngreat town house—Burlington House in Piccadilly—was being built, next\r\ndoor to the Lord Chancellor’s.[241] The families of Cork and Clarendon\r\nwere to be further united by the marriage of Lord Clarendon’s son and\r\nLord Burlington’s daughter; and another daughter was to marry Lord\r\nHinchinbroke, son of the Earl of Sandwich, who, as Admiral of the Fleet\r\n(with Pepys as his secretary), had brought Charles back from The Hague.\r\nThe prosperous and good-natured Earl of Burlington, treading softly with\r\nhis compeers in the Matted Gallery at Whitehall, or making one of the\r\ngroup of courtiers about my Lord Duke in his Chamber, was of all the Cork\r\nfamily the likest to the great Earl in his ingenuous love of comfort and\r\ndisplay. He thoroughly enjoyed his position as head of the family. It\r\nis told of him that, sailing down the Thames in some gay barge-load of\r\nnoble company, he would never forget to raise his hat when he came in\r\nsight of Deptford Church. “Have I not reason?” he would say; and he would\r\ntell how there, in Deptford Church, little Hodge, the first-born, lay\r\nburied, and how by this child’s death, so many years before, he, Richard\r\nBoyle, the second son, had come to be Earl of Cork. Lady Ranelagh, back\r\nfrom Ireland, had her reservations about the luxurious living at “my\r\nbrother Corke’s.” “Alas!” she wrote to Robert Boyle, not long before\r\nthe Restoration, “the Entertainment of Lords, Ladies, and Reasonable\r\nCreatures are yet several things, to the great grief of your K. R.”[242]\r\n\r\nBut the Earl and his Countess had always been popular people. After the\r\nRestoration, when their daughter Anne married young Lord Hinchinbroke,\r\nthe Earl of Sandwich’s son, Lady Sandwich’s gratification in this\r\nalliance knew no bounds: “They are very good condition, wise and\r\nchearfull people,” she wrote just after the wedding. “She” (the bride)\r\n“hath a very fine free kind way of writing soe have they all, something\r\nMr. Boiles styll.”[243] And poor Pepys, much hurt by not having received\r\n“a favour” after the Hinchinbroke wedding, was mollified when he met my\r\nLord of Burlington at Whitehall; for Lord Burlington, “first by hearing\r\nthe Duke of York call me by my name did come to me and with great respect\r\ntake notice of me and my relation to my Lord Sandwich, and express\r\ngreat kindness to me.” And not long after this little interview Pepys\r\nwas at Burlington House, burning his periwig in the candle out of sheer\r\nnervousness. Little wonder; for he had just seen for the first time and\r\nsaluted my Lady Burlington—the Lady Dungarvan of the old Dublin days,\r\nfor whom the plums on the Lismore plum tree had been kept when she was\r\nexpecting her first baby.[244] “A very fine-speaking lady, and a good\r\nwoman,” says Pepys; “but old and not handsome, but a brave woman.” He\r\nwas to see more of her daughter, young Lady Hinchinbroke. “I cannot\r\nsay she is a beauty, nor ugly,” wrote the truthful Pepys; but he had\r\nsaluted her too, and she had been “mighty civil” on the occasion; a very\r\ngood-humoured young niece, this of Robert Boyle’s, “a lover of books and\r\npictures and of good understanding.” In honour of the young couple, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Pepys ventured on a little dinner-party, which Pepys had “much\r\nin his head” till it was successfully over, and for which he purchased\r\nhis new “pewter sesterne.” The dinner was good and plentiful, and the\r\ncompany mighty merry. “Most of the discourse,” Pepys adds naïvely,\r\n“was of my Lord Sandwich and his family, as being all of us of the\r\nfamily.”[245]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBurlington—Orrery—Shannon. Robert Boyle, in Oxford, was, of all the\r\ngreat Earl’s sons surviving, to remain “Mr. Boyle”—a virtuoso and an\r\n“Honourable Person.” He could have been a peer, he could have been a\r\nbishop, he could have been Provost of Eton. It is said he repeatedly\r\nrefused a peerage. He certainly, not long after the Restoration, declined\r\nto take Orders with a view to a Bishopric. “He was treated with great\r\ncivility and respect,” says Birch, “by the King as well as by the Earl\r\nof Southampton, Lord High Treasurer, and the Earl of Clarendon, Lord\r\nChancellor of England.” But to Robert Boyle the heirdom of a great family\r\nwas “but a glittering kind of slavery,” and “titular greatness” seemed\r\nto him “an impediment to the knowledge of many retired truths.”[246] He\r\nbelieved that the less he participated in the patrimonies of the Church\r\nthe more influence he should have in things religious. And besides—as\r\nhe explained in after years to Bishop Burnet—he had felt “no inward\r\nmotion to it by the Holy Ghost.” For the same reason he would not be\r\nProvost of Eton. How little Sir Henry Wotton, sitting on the bank by\r\nBlack Pots in the company of Izaak Walton, could have foreseen that the\r\n“Spiritay Robyn” would one day be asked to be his successor as Provost\r\nof Eton! Robert Boyle had chosen his way of life: he desired to be free\r\nto pursue knowledge for the good of mankind in the service of God. He\r\nwould not fetter himself by tests and oaths; he could not alter his\r\ncharacter. He had, as he himself expresses it, “a great (and perhaps\r\npeculiar) tenderness in point of oaths.”[247] And so there is no record\r\nof him in the Matted Gallery, no glimpse of him in lawn sleeves, or with\r\ndiamond hatband among the Courtiers, or among the nice critics of the\r\nRestoration Drama, who no longer cared for Shakespeare: “I saw Hamlet\r\nPrince of Denmark played,” says Evelyn,[248] “but now the old plays begin\r\nto disgust this refined age, since his Majesties being so long abroad.”\r\nIt is extremely doubtful if Robert Boyle ever witnessed a performance of\r\n“dear Broghill’s” _Mustapha_, even when Betterton and Ianthe took the\r\nchief parts, and the King and Lady Castlemaine, and “pretty witty Nell”\r\nwere there to see it.[249]\r\n\r\nGlimpses of Robert Boyle there are, however, in those first years of\r\nthe Restoration. Up to the very end of 1659 he had been living in\r\nOxford, making the journey by coach now and then between Oxford and the\r\nLondon of his tastes. He was busy with his air-pump and his laboratory\r\nexperiments and the publication of his _Seraphick Love_, and he was in\r\ncorrespondence with Dick Jones and Henry Oldenberg in Paris, and with\r\nEvelyn and Hartlib in London. “Your most noble letter,” writes Hartlib to\r\nBoyle at Oxford; but Boyle’s letters of this date to Hartlib do not seem\r\nto be extant. Hartlib’s to Boyle were full of all sorts of gossip, home\r\nand foreign, and political even more than scientific. For Hartlib, in his\r\nold character of universal newsagent, was still able to pick up little\r\nbits of information at Westminster and in the City; and he sent Boyle a\r\ngood deal of gossip about the intrigues and factions of those last months\r\nof anarchy under Monk’s dictatorship; about Bradshaw’s death, and the\r\nmovements of Lambert, Desborough, Fleetwood, Vane, and Monk himself; and\r\nthe mysterious person of whom he wrote as “C. S.,” over the water. And\r\nwhen “C. S.” was actually back in London and the Restoration was a _fait\r\naccompli_, Robert Boyle and his air-pump were in London also, both to\r\nbe received with open arms by the Invisibles, and especially by Evelyn\r\nand the good Hartlib, now old and ill, and very poor, since his pension\r\nunder a Commonwealth Government had stopped.\r\n\r\n“I went to Chelsey to visit Mr. Boyle,” writes Evelyn,[250] “and see\r\nhis pneumatic engine perform divers experiments.” And, “To visite Mr.\r\nBoyle in Chelsey, and saw divers effects of the Eolipile for weighing\r\naire.”[251]\r\n\r\nBut, meantime, the weeks and months that followed immediately on the\r\nRestoration—weeks and months occupied with the passage of the Indemnity\r\nBill through the Convention Parliament and with the trial of the\r\nRegicides—must have been a painful time for Robert Boyle and for his\r\nsister Ranelagh. Lord Broghill, Cromwell’s right-hand man in Ireland and\r\nin Scotland, was, it is true, safe, and to come off with honours; but\r\nsome other people—old family friends and political comrades—were not so\r\nhappily placed. Robert Boyle had held aloof from sectaries and armies,\r\nthough some of his best friendships had been among the Puritans; but Lady\r\nRanelagh, whose house ever since the early days of the Long Parliament\r\nhad been a rendezvous of the Parliamentarian Party, and whose personal\r\nsympathies and fortunes had been bound up with Cromwell’s Protectorate,\r\nmust have followed with a heavy heart the deliberations of the Houses\r\nwhich were to determine the fates of many political and personal friends.\r\n_The Regicides_: why, in the last ten years England and Ireland had been\r\ngoverned by Regicides! Some of them, it is true, were beyond reach.\r\nCromwell—chief graves; but there were to be a great many exceptions\r\nto the Bill of Indemnity and Oblivion. There were those who were to be\r\nexcepted as actual “Regicides”; and those who were to be excepted as\r\n“Non-regicides,” and those classed as “miscellaneous exceptions.” There\r\nwere men to be excepted “absolutely”—which meant their execution; and men\r\nto be excepted “non-capitally,” which meant everything but execution;\r\nand men to be excepted “for incapacitation only,” which meant a lifelong\r\nobscurity. There were men who had absconded, and men who had remained on\r\nthe spot; men who had pleaded and extenuated, and men who steadfastly\r\nmaintained the righteousness of their acts. How was it to fare with all\r\nand each of these? What was to be the fate of Richard Cromwell, so lately\r\n“his now Highness,” and Henry Cromwell, the broadminded and melancholy\r\nyoung Lord Lieutenant of Ireland—poor Henry, who had been in love with\r\nDorothy Osborne, who was in love with Sir William Temple? And what was\r\nto become of Cromwell’s widow—“Old Noll’s wife,” the Londoners called\r\nher now: the voice of the people had strangely changed its tone. And the\r\ngreat men of the Party—so many of whom had been among Lady Ranelagh’s\r\npersonal friends—how was it to fare with Lambert, Ludlow, St. John,\r\nFleetwood, Haselrig, Lenthall, Whitlocke, Vane, Desborough, Pennington,\r\nThurloe, and President Lawrence? Henry Lawrence, the President’s son,\r\nhad been young Lord Barrymore’s friend ever since they were pupils\r\ntogether with Milton, in the Barbican. And Henry Lawrence was still one\r\nof Milton’s disciples—a constant visitor to the garden-house in Petty\r\nFrance. And young Lord Barrymore’s second wife was a Lawrence—Martha\r\nLawrence. How is it possible to unravel the cruel intricacies of civil\r\nwar?[252] And what would be done with Goodwin and Hugh Peters, and the\r\nblind Milton himself, whose _Eikonoklastes_ and _Pro Populo Defensio_\r\nwere by order of the House—issued within a week or two after the\r\nRestoration—to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman?\r\n\r\nHangings, drawings and quarterings were not extraordinary events in those\r\ndays; but it would be interesting to know how the sentence pronounced\r\non Major-General Harrison—first sentenced of the Regicides—affected so\r\nhumane and sensitive a man as Robert Boyle. His sister Ranelagh, woman\r\nas she was, had more of the old soldier-earl in her composition, and\r\nperhaps, like her Elizabethan father, looked upon such a death as an\r\ninevitable “cloudy end.”\r\n\r\n“... The Court doth award that you ... be drawn upon a hurdle to the\r\nplace of execution and there you shall be hanged by the neck, and, being\r\nalive, shall be cut down and ... your entrails to be taken out of your\r\nbody, and, you living, the same to be burnt before your eyes, and your\r\nhead to be cut off, your body to be divided into four quarters, and head\r\nand quarters to be disposed of at the pleasure of the King’s Majesty; and\r\nthe Lord have mercy upon your soul!”[253]\r\n\r\nWas Boyle weighing the air with his Eolipile on October 13 when Pepys set\r\noff to Charing Cross to see Major-General Harrison hanged, drawn, and\r\nquartered? “Which was done there, he looking as cheerful as any man could\r\ndo in that condition.”[254] But in that hungry crowd Pepys could scarcely\r\nhave been near enough to hear Harrison’s last words, which sometimes seem\r\nto echo in Charing Cross to this day: “He hath covered my head many times\r\nin the day of battle. By God I have leaped over a wall; by God I have\r\nrun through a troop; and by my God I will go through this death, and He\r\nwill make it easy to me.... Now unto thy hands, O Lord Jesus, I commit my\r\nSpirit....”\r\n\r\nNor could Mr. Pepys have seen Harrison strike out at the hangman half-way\r\nthrough the horrible, bloody work.\r\n\r\nMr. Evelyn did not go out purposely to see any of the executions of the\r\nRegicides;[255] but on the 17th he chanced to meet “their quarters,\r\nmangl’d and cutt and reeking, as they were brought from the gallows in\r\nbaskets on the hurdle. O the miraculous Providence of God!”[256]\r\n\r\nBut what of Milton all this time—the blind Republican, to whom Lady\r\nRanelagh had been more than all kith and kin? Had Boyle and Hartlib ever\r\ngot from Mr. Milton that prescription they so much wanted?\r\n\r\nMilton’s escape from punishment at the Restoration is one of the puzzles\r\nof English history. How was it effected—by what combination of political\r\ninfluences—who, in fact, pulled the wires? Parliament has always been\r\nvery clever in engineering itself, more or less constitutionally, out\r\nof its own tight corners; but there has never been a cleverer piece of\r\nparliamentary engineering than the way in which Milton was brought off\r\nat the Restoration. When, after Cromwell’s death, Lady Ranelagh returned\r\nfrom Ireland to her house in the Mall, Milton was still living, almost a\r\nneighbour, in his garden-house in Petty France; still in correspondence\r\nwith her boy Dick Jones and his tutor Oldenburg, in Paris; still Latin\r\nSecretary to the Council, with Andrew Marvell as his loyal assistant;\r\nand the uneasy dawn of the New Year 1660 had found him, despondent but\r\nundaunted, still fighting hard, by tract-warfare, for a doomed Republic.\r\nMilton the Pamphleteer and Lambert the General are to be remembered\r\ntogether as the last two opponents of the Restoration. But in March,\r\nafter Milton’s printed exhortations to the Council and to Monk himself,\r\nthe blind secretary had been discharged from his office, and an order\r\nissued for the arrest of Milton’s publisher. And on May 7—the very day\r\nbefore Charles II was proclaimed in London—Milton had disappeared from\r\nthe garden-house in Petty France. Nobody knows what had been done about\r\nhis children, or whose friendly hand guided the blind man’s steps into\r\nhis hiding-place. “In the house of a friend in Bartholomew Close”—a\r\nnarrow passage, entered from West Smithfield under an archway that was\r\nvery old even in Milton’s day[257]—Milton was to lie concealed for more\r\nthan three months. His case and Goodwin’s[258] came up together before\r\nthe House on June 16, and it was ordered that their books were to be\r\ncalled in and burnt, and that the men themselves were to be “forthwith\r\nsent for in custody.” But both men were in hiding, and somehow it was\r\nAugust 13 before the two names came up again; and at that moment the\r\nIndemnity Bill was hanging in mid-air between the Lords and Commons.\r\nNeither of the two men had been found; and though the Proclamation\r\ncalling in all copies of their books for burning by the hangman was\r\nthen duly placarded all over London, there was no further order for the\r\narrest of the two men themselves. On August 28 the Indemnity Bill had\r\npassed both Houses; on August 29 it had received the King’s assent, the\r\nAct of Indemnity and Oblivion was on the Statute Book, _and there was no\r\nmention of Milton in it from first to last_. Goodwin’s name appeared;\r\nhe was incapacitated for life for any public trust. But of Milton, the\r\nRepublican pamphleteer, Cromwell’s Latin secretary, who had done so\r\nincalculably much more, nothing—his name had somehow dropped out. Milton\r\nwas saved—“to the surprise of all people,” says Bishop Burnet.[259]\r\n\r\nIf Milton had been hanged with the Regicides at Charing Cross, or carted\r\nto Tyburn! And more than once during the passage of the Bill it seemed\r\npossible that it might be so. As it was, with the passing of this Act of\r\nOblivion, and the emerging of a blind Puritan into the murky sunshine of\r\nthe old London streets, Milton drops out of the story of Lady Ranelagh\r\nand the Boyle family. For a little while after the passing of the Act\r\n(his hiding-place having apparently been discovered) he seems to have\r\nbeen detained in custody by the Sergeant-at-Arms. Perhaps he was safer\r\nso. His offending tracts were duly burnt; his regicide comrades were\r\nduly hanged, drawn and quartered; and in December Milton was at large.\r\nStaunch friends he had had; Andrew Marvell was perhaps bravest and most\r\nindefatigable of them all; but it must have required more powerful\r\ninfluence than Marvell’s and Davenant’s to save John Milton. Had Lady\r\nRanelagh done him one more service greater than all before? Had she\r\nenlisted the interest of her powerful brother Broghill, and of such\r\nPrivy Councillors as she knew best—men like Sandwich and Manchester,\r\nand Annesley[260] and Morrice, and the old Lord Goring, poor Lettice’s\r\nfather-in-law,[261] and the young Charles Howard, who had married\r\n“Robyn’s yonge Mrs.” and was going to be first Earl of Carlisle? Had\r\nLady Ranelagh’s silken strings reached the little private Junto about\r\nthe King himself—Hyde, and Ormonde, and Southampton? One remembers that\r\nMr. Boyle had been “treated with great civility and respect by the King,\r\nas well as by the Earl of Southampton, Lord High Treasurer, and the Earl\r\nof Clarendon, Lord Chancellor of England.” And it is good to think that\r\nthe Boyle family—perhaps Boyle himself, whose memories went back to the\r\nMilton of _Comus_ and Eton, the Milton of the _Epitaphium Damonis_ and\r\nthe Villa Diodati in Geneva, may have had a hand in saving Milton, the\r\nblind Republican,—to write _Paradise Lost_. But if to any of them, it was\r\ncertainly to Lady Ranelagh that Milton owed his life and freedom. There\r\nis no record of any further visits from Lady Ranelagh to Milton after\r\nthat date, but it is difficult to believe her friendship for Milton ended\r\nwith the Restoration. The garden-house in Petty France was to be no more\r\nhis home: his blind steps turned eastward, to Holborn again, and Jewin\r\nStreet, and then to Artillery Walk, near Bunhill Fields, where he was to\r\nresume and finish his great poem, and where he was to end his days. It is\r\ndifficult to believe that Lady Ranelagh never again knocked at the blind\r\nman’s door; and it must be taken for granted that one day in late August\r\nor early September 1667 a presentation-copy of _Paradise Lost_ arrived at\r\nthe house in Pall Mall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn a November afternoon—Nov. 28, 1660—the usual little audience of\r\nphilosophers had assembled to listen to one of Dr. Christopher Wren’s\r\nastronomy lectures at Gresham College, in Basinghall Street.[262] Wren,\r\nwho had been astronomy professor there since 1657, lectured on Wednesday\r\nafternoons during Term-time from two to three—and it was a custom for the\r\nlittle company to stay on after the lecture, adjourning to another room\r\nfor “mutuall converse.” The political disasters of the last year or two\r\nhad somewhat interrupted the advancement of learning; the soldiers had,\r\nin fact, for a time, been quartered in Gresham College. But by the end\r\nof November 1660 things were settling down again, and the lectures were\r\ngoing on as usual. At this particular lecture the _virtuosi_ present were\r\nLord Brouncker, Mr. Boyle, Mr. Bruce, Sir Robert Moray, Sir Paule Neile,\r\nDr. Wilkins, Dr. Goddard, Dr. Petty, Mr. Ball, Mr. Rooke, Mr. Wren,\r\nand Mr. Hill; and their “mutuall converse” turned on the formation of a\r\nscientific society, on a broader basis than had been hitherto attempted—a\r\nsociety “for the promoting of Physico-Mathematicall-Experimentall\r\nLearning,” to consist of weekly meetings, which were to be held every\r\nWednesday from that date onwards.\r\n\r\nThis, it must be remembered, was no outcome of the Restoration. It\r\nwas fifteen years since the Invisibles had begun their meetings,\r\n“precluding matters of theology and state affairs,” sometimes at Gresham\r\nCollege, oftener in Dr. Goddard’s house in Wood Street, or at the\r\nBull’s Head Tavern in Cheapside. Robert Boyle at that time had been a\r\nboy of eighteen, just back from Geneva, and introduced into the little\r\nHartlib-Durie-Comenius circle to find that the Parliament men were\r\nalready interested in a scheme of “Verulamian education.” In November\r\n1660 the Invisibles were fifteen years wiser than they had been in 1645.\r\nAnd what a fifteen years it had been! Had there ever been such a fifteen\r\nyears in English History? Some of them, after the visitation of Oxford,\r\nhad migrated there, taking posts vacated by Royalists, and forming the\r\nOxford branch of the Invisible Society; and now again these same men,\r\nremoved at the Restoration from their posts in Oxford University, were\r\nturning back to London. It was the old Invisible College of 1645 that was\r\nto merge itself in the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nSo, on that November afternoon 1660, in Gresham College, a new Society\r\nwas formed. It was arranged that its “original members” were to be\r\nthose present, with some others then and there proposed as eligible,\r\nthirty-nine names being suggested and written down. Among them were\r\nJohn Evelyn, Dr. Wallis, Dr. Seth Ward, Dr. Willis, Dr. Bathurst, Sir\r\nKenelm Digby, Abraham Cowley, John Denham, Mr. William Croone, Mr.\r\nRichard Jones, and Henry Oldenburg. Robert Boyle’s influence was already\r\nmaking itself felt. Most of these men were Oxford colleagues, personal\r\nfriends, and old Invisibles. The last three must have been his special\r\nnominations, and two of them were his own kinsmen. Dick Jones, his\r\nhopeful nephew, had just returned with Henry Oldenburg from their foreign\r\ntour. William Croone, who was nominated _in absentia_ for the post of\r\nRegistrar of the Society, was presumably a son of the old Earl of Cork’s\r\n“Cozen Croone”, the vintner of the King’s Head in Cheapside;[263] because\r\nthe “Croonian Lecture Fund,” long afterwards bequeathed to the Royal\r\nSociety by Mr. Croone’s widow, was derived from “one fifth of the clear\r\nrent of the King’s Head Tavern in or near old Fish Street, London, at\r\nthe corner of Lambeth Hill.”[264] This makes William Croone a cousin of\r\nRobert Boyle’s; and he was a creditable relative, this heir of old Cozen\r\nCroone the vintner, for he was afterwards Doctor of Physic and Gresham\r\nProfessor of Rhetoric; and the Royal Society owes its Croonian Lecture\r\nFund to his and his widow’s generosity, and to the takings at the old\r\nKing’s Head in Cheapside.\r\n\r\nOther original members—they were afterwards “Fellows”—were added at later\r\nmeetings. And what a list it was! There was Aubrey of the “Lives,” and\r\nAshmole, of museum celebrity, and Dryden and Waller the poets, and old\r\nHaak the originator of the Invisible College, and Robert Hooke, whose\r\nservices at Oxford Boyle amiably dispensed with so that he might be\r\nCurator,[265] and Peter Pett the Naval Commissioner, and Thomas Sprat,\r\nthe Society’s enthusiastic first biographer, and Governor Winthrop from\r\nConnecticut, and Isaac Barrow the scholarly divine,[266] and John Graunt,\r\nthe “tradesman” who drew up the Bills of Mortality. Peers there were in\r\nplenty,—the Duke of Buckingham and the Earls of Devonshire, Northampton,\r\nand Sandwich, among them; and Bishops—present and future. Doctors of\r\nPhysic, of course, and Lawyers of the Temple; Churchmen, Statesmen,\r\nArmy-men, Navy-men, and City-men. “It is to be noted,” says Sprat, “that\r\nthey have freely admitted men of different Religions, Countries, and\r\nProfessions of Life. This they were obliged to do, or else they would\r\ncome far short of the largeness of their own declarations. For they\r\nopenly profess not to lay the foundation of an English, Scotch, Irish,\r\nPopish, or Protestant Philosophy; but a Philosophy of _Mankind_.”[267]\r\n\r\nSir Robert Moray, a Scotsman and a favourite at Whitehall, had quickly\r\n“brought in word from the Court” that the King approved of the aims\r\nof the Society. Moray, who had a laboratory of his own at Whitehall,\r\nacted for a time as interim-President, and was certainly the life and\r\nsoul of the infant Society; and on May 3, 1661—not many days after his\r\ncoronation, Charles II was shown, through his own great telescope,\r\nSaturn’s rings and Jupiter and his satellites. His Majesty became really\r\ninterested, and began to discourse astronomy as he sat at supper in\r\nWhitehall.[268] And a few weeks later—Sir Robert Moray still acting as\r\ngo-between—the King granted the Society’s petition for a Royal Charter,\r\nand was “pleased to offer himselfe to be entered one of the Society.”\r\nOn July 15, 1662, the Charter of Incorporation passed what Evelyn calls\r\nthe “Broade Seale.” Lord Brouncker was elected first President and\r\nHenry Oldenburg Secretary.[269] The King presented the Society with\r\nits mace,[270] on which were emblematically embossed the Crown and\r\nRoyal Arms, the rose, harp, thistle, and fleur de lys. In April 1663,\r\nhowever, a second and improved Charter passed the Great Seal.[271] The\r\nKing in this declared himself Founder and Patron; Arms were granted to\r\nthe Society, and a motto from Horace was chosen—_Nullius in Verba_. And\r\nthe Royal Society kept its first anniversary on November 30, 1663, St.\r\nAndrew’s Day having been selected partly as nearest to November 28, the\r\nday of its first meeting, but also in compliment, it is believed, to Sir\r\nRobert Moray, the popular Scotsman who from the very beginning had been\r\none of its most energetic members.\r\n\r\nStrange times! It has been rightly said that the foundation of the Royal\r\nSociety was one of the few creditable events of the Restoration. Exactly\r\na month before the Charter of Incorporation passed the Great Seal, Sir\r\nHenry Vane had been beheaded on Tower Hill, “the trumpets brought under\r\nthe scaffold that he might not be heard”; and little more than a month\r\nlater came the dreaded St. Bartholomew’s Day, which turned nearly two\r\nthousand rectors and vicars—one-fifth of the English clergy—out of their\r\nparishes. The doings of “Our Society”, meantime, read like a little oasis\r\nin a desert of intolerance. The old Earl of Cork, who had sent his sons\r\nto fight the “rebelleows” Presbyterian Scots, and spent the last days\r\nof his own life in fighting the rebellious Irish Papists, would have\r\nrubbed his eyes if he could have seen his Robyn walking in procession,\r\nside by side with the Roman Catholic Sir Kenelm Digby, each wearing a St.\r\nAndrew’s Cross pinned into his hat!\r\n\r\n“It being St. Andrew’s Day, who was our patron,” says Evelyn\r\ncomplacently, “each fellow wore a St. Andrew’s Crosse of ribbon on the\r\ncrowne of his hatt. After the election we din’d together, his Majesty\r\nsending us venison.”[272]\r\n\r\nSome difference of opinion, however, there seems to have been among the\r\nphilosophers about the choice of their patron saint. Pepys did not care\r\nmuch who the saint was, but he grumbled at having to pay two shillings\r\nfor the badge.[273] Aubrey once confided to Sir William Petty that\r\nhe would have preferred St. George, or, failing him, St. Isidore—“a\r\nphilosopher canonised.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the irrepressible Petty, “I had rather have had it been St.\r\nThomas’s Day, for he would not believe till he had seen and putt his\r\nfinger into the holes, according to the motto, _Nullius in Verba_.”[274]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE PLAGUE AND THE FIRE\r\n\r\n    “It hath commonly been looked upon as very strange that a\r\n    diligent Cultivator of Experimental Philosophy should be a\r\n    zealous Embracer of the Christian Religion; and that a great\r\n    Esteem of Experience and a High Veneration for Religion should\r\n    be compatible in the same Person; but....”—ROBERT BOYLE, _The\r\n    Christian Virtuoso_.\r\n\r\n    “The hottest day that ever I felt in my life ... I did in Drury\r\n    Lane see two or three houses marked with a red cross upon the\r\n    doors, and ‘Lord have mercy upon us’ writ there....”—PEPYS’S\r\n    _Diary_, June 7, 1665.\r\n\r\n    “... it still encreasing, and the wind great ... and all over\r\n    the Thames, with one’s faces in the wind, you were almost\r\n    burned with a shower of fire-drops ... saw the fire grow; and\r\n    as it grew darker appeared more and more, and in corners and\r\n    upon steeples, and between churches and houses, as far as we\r\n    could see up the hill of the city, in a most horrid malicious\r\n    bloody flame ... one entire arch of fire from this to the other\r\n    side of the bridge.... The churches, houses and all on fire\r\n    and flaming at once ... and a horrid noise the flames made and\r\n    the cracking of houses at their ruine....”—PEPYS’S _Diary_,\r\n    September 2, 1666.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1661 saw the publication not only of Boyle’s _Physiological\r\nEssays_[275] already mentioned, but of his epoch-making _Scepticall\r\nChymist_.[276] It was the first year of “Our Society’s” existence; a year\r\nof immense interest and activity among its members; but Boyle himself was\r\nnot always in London, and not indeed wholly occupied with the claims of\r\nexperimental science. In 1662 he found himself unexpectedly in possession\r\nof more Irish land, a grant of “forfeited impropriations” having been\r\nobtained from the King in Robert Boyle’s name, though without his\r\nknowledge. To Boyle, the gift seems to have been somewhat in the nature\r\nof a white elephant, and he applied for advice in the matter to his\r\nfriend the Bishop of Lincoln.[277] He was not sure if he ought to take\r\nthe grant at all, and still less decided as to what he ought to do with\r\nthe proceeds. He did not wish to “reflect upon those persons of honour”\r\nwho had done him the kindness unasked, and he would dearly have liked\r\nto spend the proceeds, if he did take the grant, in “the advancement of\r\nreal knowledge.” Ultimately he did decide to accept it, and to spend\r\ntwo-thirds of the proceeds in Ireland on the relief of the poor and the\r\nmaintenance of the Protestant religion; while the other third was to go\r\nto the purposes of the Corporation for the Propagation of the Gospel in\r\nNew England, of which the King had lately appointed him governor. This,\r\ntoo, had been done without Boyle’s knowledge.\r\n\r\n“So that the main benefit I intend to derive from the King’s bounty,”\r\nsays Boyle laconically, “is the opportunity of doing some good with what,\r\nif my friends had not obtained it, might have been begged by others, who\r\nwould have otherwise employed it.”[278]\r\n\r\nThe matter settled—to nobody’s entire satisfaction—Boyle went on with\r\nhis work in Oxford, sending his communications to the Royal Society\r\nthrough the secretary, Henry Oldenburg. Present or absent, Mr. Boyle\r\nwas the hero of the hour at Gresham College, and his air-pump the chief\r\nattraction of its meetings.[279]\r\n\r\n“I waited on Prince Rupert to our assembly,” says Evelyn, “where we tried\r\nseverall experiments in Mr. Boyle’s _vacuum_. A man thrusting in his arm\r\nupon exhaustion of the air had his flesh immediately swelled so as the\r\nblood was neare bursting the veins: he drawing it out we found it all\r\nspeckled.”[280]\r\n\r\nMr. Boyle, Mr. Boyle’s air-pump, and Mr. Boyle’s books—especially that\r\non the _Spring and Weight of the Air_—were the talk of the Court as well\r\nas of the College. It is quite true that “the weighing of ayre” was, in\r\nthose early days of the Society’s existence, its favourite occupation.\r\nA great change had come over the Philosophers. They found themselves\r\ninvited into a kind of scientific _Kindergarten_, where knowledge was\r\nto be gained, not through their old black-letter books, but out of\r\npots and pans and pendulums, and shining ores, and precious stones,\r\nand “anatomes” and “curiosities” and “things of nature.” And the most\r\nfascinating thing of nature at this moment—just because, perhaps, it was\r\nintangible, invisible, elusive—was “the ayre.” These men had discovered\r\nthat “the ayre” possessed properties, obeyed laws; in fact, they had\r\nsuddenly realized that they were all going about under an atmosphere. Mr.\r\nBoyle had shown it to be so; and there, in their midst, was the _machina\r\nBoyleana_.\r\n\r\nBut there were other “transactions” of the infant Royal Society. In\r\nOldenburg’s letters, and Hooke’s letters, and in the diaries of Pepys\r\nand Evelyn, there are vivid contemporary glimpses of what went on at\r\nGresham College. Poor old Hartlib was dead, and Oldenburg seems to have\r\ntaken Hartlib’s place as Boyle’s London Correspondent. He gave Boyle\r\nthe latest gossip, not only of “Our Society,” but of “State affairs”\r\nat home and abroad. From him Boyle, at Oxford, heard of the visits\r\nof distinguished foreigners—Huygens, Sorbière, and others—to Gresham\r\nCollege. Even when the attendances were “thin,” and there was not much\r\nbeing shown, these men were struck with admiration of “our experimental\r\nmethod,” our “sedate and friendly way of conference,” and “the gravity\r\nand majestickness of our order.”\r\n\r\nThe indefatigable Secretary, overworked and underpaid as he undoubtedly\r\nwas, and asking in vain for an “amanuensis,” had soon put himself in\r\ntouch with experimentalists in France, Holland, Germany, Italy, the\r\nBermudas, Poland, Sweden, New England, and the East Indies. A new\r\ngovernor of “Bombaia” had offered his services to the Society “for\r\nphilosophical purposes”: “We have taken to taske the whole universe,”\r\nwrote Oldenburg to Governor Winthrop in Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThere was really no form of “curiosity” of earth, or sea, or sky,\r\nthat was not grist to the Gresham College mill. Chariots and watches,\r\nmasonry, ores, “the nature of salts,” injection into the veins and the\r\ntransfusion of blood, the velocity of bullets, mine-damp, musical sounds\r\nand instruments, thermometers and barometers, fossils, shooting stars,\r\nand double keels were all mixed up in most admired disorder; and Mr.\r\nBoyle at Oxford was doing his best to interest the “Oxonians” in the\r\nwork going on at Gresham College; he himself being equally interested\r\nin the experiments of transfusion of blood carried on in London and the\r\n“musical experiments” made under his direction in the Oxford colleges.\r\nOldenburg reported everything to him, and Hooke, too, his old assistant,\r\nwho was now curator of Our Society. Winthrop had written about the ores\r\nto be found in New England, and an enthusiastic young Londoner had been\r\nplanting a “Virginian garden.” At one meeting of the Society there had\r\nbeen “a good store of discourse concerning star-shoots”; at another all\r\nthe experiments were of “the descent of bodies in water.” On more than\r\none occasion a party of the philosophers—Sir Robert Moray, Dr. Wilkins,\r\nDr. Goddard, Hooke, and others—had climbed to the top of the steeple of\r\nSt. Paul’s “to make the ‘Torricellian experiments’ of falling bodies\r\nand of pendulums.” And after the Correspondence Committee had met at\r\nMr. Povy’s house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, for the purpose of collecting\r\nevidence from “all parts of the world,” Oldenburg wrote to Boyle: “This\r\nwas our entertainment above ground, I leave you to guess what our\r\ncorrespondence was underground in the grotto, and near the well, that is\r\nthe conservatory of so many dozen of wine-bottles of all kinds.”[281]\r\n\r\nSo the letters came and went between London and Oxford; and Boyle’s\r\nmanuscripts and proof-sheets were sent to Oldenburg by coach or\r\ncarrier, or by Boyle’s own servant. “These coachmen and carriers are\r\nincorrigible,” wrote Oldenburg, when parcels were charged double and\r\nletters went astray; and there was, in particular, a “she-porter” who\r\nspecially annoyed Mr. Oldenburg. Presently, Mr. Sprat was writing the\r\nSociety’s history—as far as it went; and Samuel Butler was satirising\r\nGresham College up and down the town. Everybody knew that the King kept\r\na copy of _Hudibras_ in his pocket: might not the young Society suffer\r\nfrom Butler’s sarcasm? The Secretary was ruffled and anxious; and he\r\nowned to Boyle that he could have done a good deal more in pushing and\r\npopularising certain investigations for the Society “if I had not been\r\nafraid of _Hudibras_.”[282]\r\n\r\nBut while Hudibras was ridiculing the experimentalists, and\r\nRestoration-orthodoxy was shaking its head over the new philosophy, the\r\nSociety had its votaries—a good many of them, it is true, on the other\r\nside of the channel.[283] If Butler made fun of the Philosophers—\r\n\r\n    “Their learned speculations,\r\n    And all their constant occupations\r\n    To measure and to weigh the air\r\n    And turn a circle to a square”[284]—\r\n\r\na certain Italian enthusiast composed twenty-six stanzas of unqualified\r\npraise, one of which Oldenburg committed to memory and sent triumphantly\r\nto Boyle—\r\n\r\n    “Heroic constellations dispense\r\n    One ray of your celestial influence\r\n    That with the telescope I may descry\r\n    The sacred treasures of your Pansophy!”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the prettiest compliment of all came from a Parisian friend\r\nof Oldenburg’s, who was so charmed with Mr. Boyle’s writings, and\r\nso desolated to hear of Mr. Boyle’s delicate health, that he begged\r\nOldenburg to suggest to Mr. Boyle that he should migrate into the sweet\r\nair of France. “Proposez-luy la chose: il pourra philosopher par tout, et\r\nfaire provision de santé pour philosopher plus longtemps.”\r\n\r\nThe message was duly delivered; but Boyle’s philosophising was to go on\r\nat home, and praise and blame seem to have had small effect upon him. “I\r\nfreely confess,” he wrote, “that the great difficulty of things, and the\r\nlittle abilities I find myself furnished with to surmount it, do often,\r\nin general, beget in me a _great_ distrust even of things, whereof my\r\nadversary’s objections give me not _any_.”[285]\r\n\r\nThe year 1663 saw the publication of three of Robert Boyle’s books.\r\n_Some Considerations touching the Usefulness of Experimental Natural\r\nPhilosophy_, collected from the work of the previous year or two, was\r\npublished at Oxford. _Some Experiments and Considerations touching\r\nColour_ was published in London; and in the same year he published,\r\nalso in London, _Some Considerations touching the Style of the Holy\r\nScriptures_. This last, originally suggested to him by Broghill at\r\nMarston Bigot, had been the work of some years; and at the time of its\r\npublication he was interesting himself in a scheme for the translation\r\nof the New Testament for use in Turkey. Oldenburg “rejoiced hugely”\r\nover this scheme. “I confess,” says the Puritan secretary of the Royal\r\nSociety, “it will be troublesome and dangerous to spread such a book as\r\nthe Bible in Turkey; but yet it ought to be attempted.”\r\n\r\nThe summer vacations, when Oxford was deserted, seem to have been spent\r\nby Boyle partly in London with Lady Ranelagh and among the _virtuosi_,\r\nand partly in the various family country houses, where he was always\r\nwelcomed as at once the hero, the puzzle, and the pet of this great\r\nfamily. Delicious Leeze, in Essex, where Charles and Mary lived, was\r\nnot far from London. “You shall be absolute master of your own time,”\r\nMary assured him—conscious, no doubt, that Charles did not know much\r\nabout the New Philosophy. And at Marston Bigot, in Somersetshire, dear\r\nBroghill and Lady Pegg, when they were in England, were most excellent\r\ncompany. Marston was not far from Stalbridge, and though Boyle did not\r\nnow often stay at his manor-house, he liked to keep it in perfect order,\r\nfor Frank’s sake, who might have it after him. The “fruit-nurseries” of\r\nStalbridge, especially, were well known in the neighbourhood. “I hear you\r\nhave that way also a large charity for the public good of England,” wrote\r\nDr. John Beale of Yeovil, in one of his delightful screeds to Boyle.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1664, Boyle had been suffering with his eyes; and on\r\nhis journey to the west—he was apparently that summer at Stalbridge and\r\nMarston Bigot—he stayed at Salisbury, to consult his friend and oculist,\r\nDr. Turberville.[286]\r\n\r\nThat autumn, State affairs were almost of more interest at the moment\r\nthan the transactions of the Society; and war-gossip and Court-gossip\r\noccupied a considerable portion of Oldenburg’s letters to Boyle. Hooke,\r\nthe Curator, wrote also, but his letters were of “the conjunction of\r\nMercury and Sol.” Boyle was back in Oxford in October; and on October 24,\r\nwhen Evelyn paid a visit to Oxford, he found Boyle “with Dr. Wallis and\r\nDr. Christopher Wren in the Tower of the Scholes with an inverted tube or\r\ntelescope, observing the discus of the Sunn for the passing of Mercury\r\nthat day before it; but the latitude was so great that nothing appeared.”\r\nThe little party, disappointed, went on to the Bodleian, and to look at\r\nthe Sheldonian, then building by the generosity of the Archbishop, and\r\nthe great picture with too many “nakeds” in it, over the Altar in the\r\nchapel of All Souls.[287]\r\n\r\nBoyle was still in Oxford in November, when the Duke of York and “many\r\ngallants” were going off to join the Fleet; and in December, when the\r\n“mighty vote” of £2,500,000 was passed, that Charles II might “be\r\npossessed of the dominion at sea, and the disposal of Trade.”[288]\r\nEverybody in London was feeling very rich and belligerent—the exact\r\nmethods by which the money was to be raised not having been yet\r\ndecided upon. That same November, Oldenburg was begging for Boyle’s\r\ncommunications to the Society on the _History of Cold_. They would\r\ncome, as he said, very seasonably, “Our Society having already, by the\r\nlate Frost, excited one another to the prosecution of experiments of\r\nfreezing.” The frost lasted long enough to please the little London boys\r\nand the Philosophers alike. January came in, with “excessive sharp frost\r\nand snow.”[289] The London streets were full of snowballs on January\r\n2, when Mr. Pepys dined in the Piazza, Covent Garden, with my Lord\r\nBrouncker—who was a great many other things besides President of the\r\nRoyal Society,—and occasioned such mirth by reading aloud to the company\r\nthe “ballet” lately made “by the men at sea to the ladies in town.” Who\r\ndoes not remember Buckhurst’s—\r\n\r\n    “To all ye ladies now on land\r\n      We men at sea indite;\r\n    But first would have you understand\r\n      How hard it is to write.\r\n    The Muses now, and Neptune too,\r\n    We must implore to write to you,\r\n              With a fa la la la la!”\r\n\r\nAnd it is very certain Lord Brouncker and his company laughed loudest\r\nover the second verse—\r\n\r\n    “For though the Muses should prove kind\r\n      And fill our empty brain,\r\n    Yet if rough Neptune rouse the wind\r\n      To wave the azure main,\r\n    Our paper, pen, and ink, and we\r\n    Roll up and down our ships at sea,\r\n              With a fa la la la la!”\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle was in town during that winter of 1664-5. There were\r\nseveral fixtures in December, January and February, which may have\r\ndrawn him there. In December he had been elected into the Company of\r\nthe Royal Mines, “and into that of Battery.” On December 22, Petty’s\r\ndouble-bottomed boat, the _Experiment_, was at last launched, in the\r\npresence of the King.[290] On January 9, the Royal Society carried their\r\nnew Charter Book and Laws to the King at Whitehall, for the King to\r\nwrite “Founder” after his name, and the Duke of York to enter himself as\r\na Fellow. Gresham College was particularly active in February and March,\r\nand Hooke was lecturing there on the Comet which had lately been the talk\r\nof London. “Mighty talk there is of the Comet that is seen a’ nights;\r\nand the King and Queen did sit up last night to see it, and did, it\r\nseems.”[291] Lord Sandwich, who was with the fleet at Portsmouth, thought\r\nit was “the most extraordinary thing he ever saw.” And Robert Hooke,\r\nthe little deformed chorister of Christchurch, was trying to explain\r\nthis phenomenon to the London of 1665: “Among other things, proving very\r\nprobably that this is the very same Comet that appeared before, in the\r\nyear 1618, and that in such a time probably will appear again, which is a\r\nvery new opinion; but all will be in print.”[292] And on February 15, the\r\nday on which Mr. Pepys was admitted a member of the Royal Society, the\r\ndiscussion and experiments had been on Fire: “how it goes out in a place\r\nwhere the ayre is not free, and sooner out where the ayre is exhausted,\r\nwhich they shewed by an engine on purpose.”[293]\r\n\r\nIt was after this meeting that some of the philosophers adjourned to the\r\nCrown Tavern, behind the Exchange, for a “club supper”; but though Pepys\r\nexpressly mentions having seen Mr. Boyle at the afternoon meeting of the\r\nSociety, he does not make it clear whether Mr. Boyle was at the club\r\nsupper afterwards. He may have been: “Here excellent discourse, till ten\r\nat night,” records Pepys—“and then home.”\r\n\r\nIn February, Boyle brought out at last his little volume of _Occasional\r\nReflections on Several Subjects_; youthful essays, written long before,\r\nin the Dorset lanes or by the slow-burning wood fire in his manor-house:\r\n“the mislaid scribbles which I drew up in my infancy,” he calls them. The\r\nbook was published by Herringman at his shop at the Anchor in the Lower\r\nWalk in the New Exchange. It was not intended to occasion the mirth that\r\nBuckhurst’s “ballet” had produced: it was criticised, rather sharply, by\r\nsome people at the time; but it gained an extraordinary popularity, and\r\nit was to be ridiculed as only the books that have been very popular ever\r\nare. And its appearance gave great pleasure to Lady Ranelagh, who had\r\nlong begged him to collect and publish these fugitive pieces, and now at\r\nlast held in her hand a little volume containing a dedicatory letter to\r\nherself—to _Sophronia_, “my dearest sister.”\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1665 in London was, as everybody knows—in spite of\r\nimpending war, and the absence of “many gallants” at sea—one of the\r\ngayest of gay London seasons. The theatres were full; the great\r\n“noon-hall” at Whitehall had been turned into a playhouse. Another\r\ncomet, every bit as bright as the last, was reported in the April sky.\r\nThe Park was filled with fair women; chief among them, according to\r\nPepys, was the “very great beauty,” Mrs. Middleton, for whom Boyle’s\r\nhopeful young nephew—Milton’s pupil—Mr. Dick Jones, had quite forsaken\r\nthe Philosophers.[294] And while the bees in Evelyn’s garden at Deptford\r\nwere making their honey and combs “mighty pleasantly,” and Evelyn himself\r\nwas immersed in the provision of hospital accommodation for sick and\r\nwounded seamen, in the coffee-houses the talk was all of the Dutch fleet,\r\nand of the Plague that was growing in London. Everybody was ready with a\r\nremedy, “some saying one thing and some another.” On June 3, all London\r\nwas on the river, listening to the guns of the opposing Dutch and English\r\nfleets;[295] and on June 7, the day before the news of the great victory\r\narrived in London, Mr. Pepys, much to his discomfiture, saw those red\r\ncrosses on the doors in Drury Lane, and the poor human appeal, “Lord,\r\nhave mercy on us!”[296]\r\n\r\nWhile the Plague raged in London, Lady Ranelagh and her two daughters—“my\r\ngirls” she always calls them—were at delicious Leeze. It was not the same\r\npatriarchal Leeze to which the romantic runaways had been carried in Lady\r\nRanelagh’s coach. The husband and wife, who were Charles and Mary Rich in\r\nthose days, were Earl and Countess of Warwick now. It was four-and-twenty\r\nyears since they had been obliged to run away to be married, because\r\nCharles Rich was only a younger son. Charles Rich was “my Lord of\r\nWarwick” now. It was six years since he had succeeded to the earldom; and\r\na great deal can happen in six years. Their son—their only child—whose\r\nillness in babyhood had so changed Mary’s outlook on life, had been\r\nreared to manhood, and had been married—a girl and boy marriage it was—to\r\nmy Lord of Devonshire’s very young daughter. For the sake of her boy, and\r\nto arrange this alliance satisfactorily, Mary had gone to London, leaving\r\n“the sweet quiet of the country for the horrid confusion of the town”;\r\nand from there she had written to Robert Boyle at Oxford, whom she still\r\nalways called her “dearest, dearest squire,” in great spirits: “We are\r\nlike to be very great,” she said, “for the lad is like to be a successful\r\nlover.”\r\n\r\nAfter the marriage, the bridegroom had been sent to travel in France,\r\nand the bride taken home by her husband’s parents to Leeze; and after\r\nthe boy husband came back to her, for a very little while they had all\r\nlived together, and Mary had seen her son with a wife of his own. But in\r\nMay 1664 he fell ill of smallpox. They were all in London at the time,\r\nat Warwick House, in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where Mary herself had had\r\nsmallpox in 1648. The little wife was removed, out of the infection, to\r\nher father’s house. The “young ladies,” Charles Rich’s nieces, who lived\r\nwith them, daughters of the dead elder brother, were packed off to Leeze.\r\n“My Lord” himself was persuaded to go to his sister-in-law Ranelagh’s\r\nhouse in Pall Mall. And then—\r\n\r\n“I shut up myself with him,” says Mary, the mother, “doing all I could\r\nboth for his soul and body.” But the boy died in eight days: “He wanted\r\nabout four months of being of age.” Mary sent the Earl of Manchester to\r\nLady Ranelagh’s house to break the news to my Lord of Warwick, who, when\r\nhe heard it, “cried out so terribly that his cry was heard a great way.”\r\nBut Mary was “unrewly” no longer; she had made her vow and she had found\r\nher Master: “I was dumb,” she says, “and held my peace, because God did\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nFor the second time Lady Ranelagh fetched Mary away to her own house. The\r\ngreat Warwick House in Lincoln’s Inn Fields was put up for sale—Mary\r\nnever entered it again. Later she went to drink the waters at Epsom and\r\nTonbridge, “to remove the great pain I had constantly at my heart after\r\nmy son’s death.” And Dr. Walker, the worthy chaplain who had preached so\r\nawakingly to Mary twenty years before, after her child recovered, did his\r\nbest to comfort her after her child was dead.\r\n\r\nA year had passed since then, and now, in the summer of 1665, with the\r\nPlague raging in London, the childless pair were at Leeze again with\r\nthe young ladies and the very young widow, and Lady Ranelagh and her\r\ngirls; and my Lord of Warwick—much in the minority—was not quite so\r\ngood-tempered as he used to be in the old-young days before he was so\r\ntormented by gout.[297]\r\n\r\nThey had left London only just in time; for early in July several of the\r\nhouses in Pall Mall were infected, and one “almost emptied.”[298] The\r\nmeetings of the Royal Society had been adjourned. The King and Court were\r\ngone:[299] people were rapidly leaving town. Hooke and Petty and Wilkins\r\nwere thinking of removing to Nonsuch, taking an operator with them in\r\norder to carry on their experiments out of range of infection.[300]\r\nOldenburg and his family remained in London. He had carefully separated\r\nhis papers—Mr. Boyle’s, the Society’s, and his own—into bundles, and had\r\nwritten instructions what should be done with them should he succumb to\r\nthe Plague. Robert Boyle was back in Oxford before the end of June, but\r\nbefore leaving town he had sent Oldenburg a “receipt for the Sickness.”\r\nPepys, it is known, went about with a bottle of “Plague-water” presented\r\nto him by Lady Carteret, of which he took a sip when he felt particularly\r\ndepressed. Whether Oldenburg drank Mr. Boyle’s medicine or not is\r\nunrecorded, but he escaped infection; and the Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety, and some of Boyle’s papers with them, went safely through the\r\nPlague only to suffer havoc in the Fire.\r\n\r\nIn July Lady Ranelagh was writing to her brother at Oxford, begging him\r\nto join the family-party at Leeze, and to bring any number more of his\r\n_Occasional Meditations_ with him, which the ladies of the family would\r\nhelp him to transcribe for a second edition of his delightful book. At\r\nLeeze they were all taking “palsy-balsam.” “Our palsy-balsam does wonders\r\nhere,” she wrote. “Crip,” who seems to have been the family apothecary,\r\nmajor-domo, and factotum, had been very careful of them all, she says.\r\nThe palsy-balsam, Crip’s “jealousy,” and God’s providence together had\r\nkept, not only the family at Leeze itself, but the entire neighbourhood,\r\nfree of infection. And all the ladies, and the Countess, and “my girls”\r\nwere at Robert Boyle’s service.[301]\r\n\r\nAnd yet he did not go. He was still at Oxford in August, much tied in\r\nattendance on Lady Clarendon and the Lord Chancellor and their new\r\ndaughter-in-law.[302] He had declined the Provostship of Eton, vacant by\r\nDr. Meredith’s death, and had accepted the degree of Doctor of Physic\r\nat the hands of the University. And he was still in Oxford early in\r\nSeptember, when Lady Ranelagh wrote again—this time in more sombre mood,\r\nfor the weekly Bills of Mortality had been grim reading. She could\r\nnot help seeing a Nemesis over London: a connexion—as awful as it was\r\ninscrutable—between “what was going on there before we left it and what\r\nhas been suffered there since.”[303] Would not her brother still seek a\r\nshelter at delicious Leeze?\r\n\r\n“For my Lord of Warwick, I can assure you, as he does me, that he is not\r\nonly not afraid, but desirous of your company here; he advises your lying\r\nat Kimbolton, my Lord Chamberlain’s house, a day’s journey from Oxford;\r\nand from thence at Audley End, another day’s journey, and thence hither,\r\nbut to Mr. Waller’s,[304] which I hope is uninfected ... and thence to\r\nParkhall,[305] which is also clear for aught I know, and thence hither is\r\nyour nearest way, and Crip would send a man to guide you....”\r\n\r\nAnd she leaves her strongest argument for the postscript—\r\n\r\n“_If you make not haste, the Court will overtake you at Oxford._”\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle was no courtier. He did run away from Oxford, but not,\r\nit seems, to Leeze. He disappeared almost as effectively as Milton\r\ndisappeared at the Restoration. For a time his friends did not know\r\nhis retreat, and sent letters to him haphazard “by way of London.” In\r\nNovember the Plague was decreasing, and Lady Ranelagh could report that\r\nat Leeze they were still all well—“Crip only excepted, who had lately\r\na roaring fit of the gout, but a very short one, in respect of those\r\nhe used to have at this time of year, which he attributes much to his\r\nchewing of scurvy-grass.” Lady Ranelagh herself was reading all her\r\nbrother’s books over again to comfort herself for his absence, and was\r\nlending them, one after the other, to the “few studious persons” whom\r\nshe met at Leeze. And her fingers were itching to open a sealed roll of\r\npapers belonging to him, labelled “About Religious Matters.”\r\n\r\nIt was January 22 before the Royal Society met again. “The first\r\nmeeting of Gresham College since the Plague,” says Pepys, who had, with\r\nexceptional bravery, remained in London through it all. “Dr. Goddard did\r\nfill us with talk, in defence of his and his fellow-physicians going out\r\nof town in the plague-time, saying that their particular patients were\r\nmost all gone out of town, and they left at liberty, and a great deal\r\nmore, etc. But what, among other fine discourse pleased me most, was\r\nSir G. Ent[306] about Respiration; that it is not to this day known, or\r\nconcluded on among physicians, nor to be done, either, how the action is\r\nmanaged by nature, or for what use it is.”\r\n\r\nApril came; and the brilliant, wanton Court was back in London; and\r\nRobert Boyle had come, not into London itself, but to a lodging found for\r\nhim in the village of Newington, on the Surrey Side. Oldenburg had walked\r\nout to Newington one day in March, before Boyle arrived, and inspected\r\nthe house and its surroundings—\r\n\r\n“It seems to be very convenient for you,” he wrote to Boyle, “there\r\nbeing a large orchard, a walk for solitary meditations, a dry ground\r\nround about, and in all appearance a good air”; advantages which were\r\naccompanied by “a civil Landlord and fair Landlady.”[307]\r\n\r\nThe immediate object of Boyle’s visit to London was probably to\r\nbe present at some of the performances of Valentine Greatrakes,\r\nthe “Stroaker,” who was making a great sensation in London by his\r\nsemi-miraculous cures. Greatrakes had originally been a lieutenant in\r\nLord Broghill’s regiment in Munster, and had more recently—having felt\r\nan “impulse”—practised his cures in county Cork. He had come to England\r\nby Lord Broghill’s advice, and had made his _début_ in an attempt to\r\ncure Lady Conway’s violent headaches. In this he failed; but he was more\r\nsuccessful with other patients, and the King sent for him to Whitehall,\r\nand he was patronised by Prince Rupert. Of course, the Faculty was\r\ndivided, and the Royal Society cautious. Mr. Stubbe, a worthy doctor of\r\nStratford-on-Avon, went so far as to publish in Oxford a tract, “The\r\nMiraculous Conformist”, addressed, without permission, to Mr. Boyle—to\r\nwhich, very naturally, Mr. Boyle took exception. It was followed by a\r\nLondon-published tract, “Wonders no Miracles”; and the controversy still\r\nwaged about the “Stroaker” when Boyle went to London and was present at\r\nsome of his “stupendous performances.” Mr. Boyle made careful notes, and\r\nsubmitted to Mr. Greatrakes a series of written questions—which do not\r\nseem to have been answered. But in the end, Robert Boyle was one of those\r\nwho, having seen the “Stroaker” at work, gave him a testimonial before\r\nhe left London. The Greatrakes episode stands on the threshold of a whole\r\nrealm of medical treatment undreamed of in 1666.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Boyle’s treatise, _Hydrostatical Paradoxes_, that had been\r\nslowly printing for several months, appeared early in that year. This\r\nwas shortly followed by his _Origin of Forms_; and a good many of his\r\nphilosophical transactions also belong to this year. Later in the summer,\r\nwhen the London season was over, he was living in his Chelsea lodging;\r\nbut he had been ill again; and Lady Ranelagh was back in her house in\r\nPall Mall.\r\n\r\nWas Boyle in London from the second of September to the fifth? Did\r\nhe watch, as it grew dark on the eve of Cromwell’s “lucky day”, from\r\nChelsea, or from Pall Mall, that arc of fire over the poor blazing\r\nCity—so lately pestilence-stricken that its burial-grounds were choked\r\nwith lime, its bells still tolling, and almost every house was in\r\nmourning? Did he see the Fire of London? Probably Boyle _was_ in London,\r\nfor on September 10, Oldenburg was writing as if Boyle had just left\r\ntown, and he says nothing in his letter to Boyle of the Fire itself,\r\nbut begins, as it were, when the Fire left off. Boyle had called at\r\nOldenburg’s house to say good-bye, and Oldenburg was much disappointed\r\nthat he had been out, but was glad that Boyle had been well enough to\r\nmake the journey: “I cannot omit acquainting you,” he goes on, “that\r\nnever a calamity—and such a one—was borne so well as this is. It is\r\nincredible how little the sufferers, though great ones, do complain\r\nof their losses. I was yesterday in many meetings of the principal\r\ncitizens whose houses are laid in ashes, who, instead of complaining,\r\ndiscoursed almost of nothing but of a Survey of London, and a design for\r\nrebuilding....”[308]\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Lady Ranelagh also wrote to Boyle; and again it is\r\nnoticeable that she gives him no account of the Fire itself. She reports\r\nher own household to be as safe as it was when he left them—\r\n\r\n“I have since taken to myself the mortification of seeing the desolations\r\nthat God, in his just and dreadful judgment, has made in the poor City,\r\nwhich is thereby now turned indeed into a ruinous heap, and gave me\r\nthe most amazing spectacle that ever I beheld in my progress about and\r\ninto this ruin. I dispensed your Charity amongst some poor families and\r\npersons that I found yet in the fields unhoused....”\r\n\r\nAnd the end of her letter is equally characteristic: “Gresham College is\r\nnow Guildhall, and the Exchange, and all. If the philosophers and the\r\ncitizens become one corporation henceforward, it may be hoped our affairs\r\nmay be better managed than they have been, unless the citizens should\r\nprove the prevailing party, which, as the worst, it is most like to do in\r\nthis world, according to the small observation of your K. R.”[309]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nA NEW LONDON\r\n\r\n    “In the meane time the King and Parliament are infinitely\r\n    zealous for the rebuilding of our ruines; and I believe it\r\n    will universally be the employment of the next spring. They\r\n    are now busied with adjusting the claims of each proprietor,\r\n    that so they may dispose things for the building after the\r\n    noblest model: Everybody brings in his idea, amongst the rest\r\n    I presented his Majestie my own Conceptions, with a Discourse\r\n    annex’d. It was the second that was seene within 2 Dayes after\r\n    the Conflagration: but Dr. Wren had got the start of me.”—JOHN\r\n    EVELYN to _Sir Samuel Tuke_, September 27, 1666.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristopher Wren had not let the ashes cool under his feet. Evelyn\r\nwas picking his way among the debris—“the ground ... so hot that it\r\neven burnt the soles of my shoes”—and mourning over the ninety burnt\r\nCity Churches, and the ruins of St. Paul’s, “one of the most antient\r\npieces of piety in the Christian World.” He was thinking of the “poore\r\nBookesellers,” who, having trusted all their “noble impressions” to the\r\ninsides of the Churches, had “ben indeede ill-treated by Vulcan.” Two\r\nhundred thousand pounds’ worth of books had been burnt: “an extraordinary\r\ndetriment,” says Evelyn, “to the whole Republiq of Learning.”[310] Pepys,\r\nafter the grimy fatigues of the past few days, had been “trimmed,” and\r\nhad gone to Church, in his Sunday best, and listened to a bad, poor\r\nsermon by the Dean of Rochester: “nor eloquent, in saying at this time\r\nthat the City is reduced from a large folio to a decimo-tertio”:—the\r\nDean, too, must have been among the booksellers. Lady Ranelagh was\r\ndispensing Robert Boyle’s charity among the houseless Londoners huddled\r\nin the fields; and Henry Oldenburg was writing to Robert Boyle in Oxford.\r\n“The Stationers of Paul’s,” he wrote, “had suffered greatly.” All their\r\nbooks, carried by them into St. Faith’s Church, under St. Paul’s, had\r\nbeen burnt; and amongst them were the “hitherto printed Transactions.”\r\n\r\n“Dr. Wren,” he continued, “has, since my last, drawn a model for a New\r\nCity, and presented it to the King, who produced it himself before the\r\nCouncil, and manifested much approbation of it. I was yesterday morning\r\nwith the Doctor, and saw the model, which methinks does so well provide\r\nfor security, conveniency, and beauty, that I can see nothing wanting\r\nas to those three main articles; but whether it has consulted with the\r\npopulousness of a great City, and whether reason of state would have that\r\nconsulted with, is a query to me. I then told the Doctor that, if I had\r\nhad an opportunity to speak with him sooner, I should have suggested to\r\nhim that such a model, contrived by him and received and approved by the\r\nRoyal Society or a Committee thereof, before it had come to the view of\r\nhis Majesty, would have given Our Society a name, and made it popular,\r\nand availed not a little to silence those who ask continually, what have\r\nthey done?”\r\n\r\nWren explained to Oldenburg that he had been obliged to act quickly,\r\n“before other designs came in.” And Oldenburg, in his letter to Boyle,\r\ntook comfort in remembering that, after all, “it was a Member that had\r\ndone it,” and that, when Wren’s design was accepted—as it undoubtedly\r\nwould be—all the world would know that the model of a New London was the\r\nwork of a Member of the Royal Society.[311]\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle, in his Oxford arm-chair, with his books and instruments\r\nabout him, must have listened sadly to such war news, and news of Court\r\nand Parliament, as found its way to him in letters out of an anxious and\r\ndistracted London. All the talk of late had been of the Navy muddle; the\r\nhuge sums of money required; the poverty of the Exchequer; the mutinous\r\nand “pressed” men, and the “natural expression of passion” of the women\r\nleft behind, who had “looked after the ships as far as they could see\r\nthem by moonlight”: a most sad state, truly, of public affairs. Distrust\r\nand anger filled the hearts of men and women, and strange rumours were\r\nafloat. During the summer, before the fire broke out, the war with the\r\nDutch had been the one thing thought of and talked about. In June, Monk,\r\nDuke of Albemarle, and the Dutch de Ruyter had engaged in a fight “the\r\nlongest and most stubborn that the seas have ever seen.”[312] The English\r\nfleet had been ruined, but the English were not conquered, and in July\r\nthe two fleets, refitted, had met again. This time it was the Dutch fleet\r\nthat was destroyed and the Dutch who refused to be conquered. And just\r\nbefore the Fire of London broke out in Pudding Lane the French fleet had\r\njoined the Dutch fleet, and the English, with a weakened navy and an\r\nexhausted exchequer, were at a standstill. After the fire, when London\r\nwas in ruins from the Tower to the Temple, strange rumours ran from mouth\r\nto mouth. There was “some kind of plot in this”; it was “a proper time\r\nfor discontents”; it was the French who did it; it was the Dutch who did\r\nit; it was the Papists who did it; it was the old Republicans—a dire\r\nrevenge on the eve of Cromwell’s Lucky Day. The prophecies in _Booker’s\r\nAlmanack_ for the year were the topics of conversation at dinner-tables;\r\nand Lady Carteret told Pepys that pieces of charred paper had been blown\r\nby the wind as far as Cranborne,[313] and that she herself had picked up,\r\nor been given, a little bit of paper on which the words were printed:\r\n“_Time is, it is done._”\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1667, a Peace Congress was sitting at Breda, but an\r\narmistice had been refused; and then it was that de Witt had seized his\r\nmoment and that the Dutch fleet sailed for the mouth of the Thames. The\r\nEnglish were unready, their seamen mutinous, their coffers empty, their\r\nbig ships laid up, for economy’s sake, in dock. Everybody knows the\r\npanic and confusion that followed—the impotent rage of a people that\r\nfelt itself betrayed: Ruyter and de Witt were at hand, coming up our own\r\nbeloved Thames with “a fine and orderly fleet of sixty sail.” And Monk,\r\nthe Duke of Albemarle, in his shirt-sleeves, at Gravesend, was doing his\r\nbest to “choke the channel.”\r\n\r\nBut the Dutch were not intending to land. After they had burnt the\r\nEnglish ships in the river, they were content to sail away again,\r\ncarrying with them, as an insolent trophy, the half-burnt hull of the\r\nship that had once been the _Naseby_, and was now the _Royal Charles_.\r\n\r\nThe rage of the Londoners knew no bounds. England was undone;—with a\r\ndebauched and lazy Prince and a licentious court; “no council, no money,\r\nno reputation at home or abroad.”[314] The very men who had stood in the\r\nStrand and blessed God at the Restoration now wished Cromwell back again:\r\n“Everybody nowadays,” says Pepys, “reflect upon Oliver and commend him,\r\nwhat brave things he did, and made all the neighbour Princes fear him.”\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1666 Lady Ranelagh was expecting her brother from\r\nOxford to make her a prolonged visit in the house in Pall Mall. And where\r\nRobert Boyle was, there must some kind of chemical laboratory be also.\r\n\r\n“I have ordered Thomas,” she wrote, “to look out for charcoal; and should\r\ngladly receive your orders to put my back house in posture to be employed\r\nby you, against your coming, that you may lose no time after.”[315]\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society was again holding its meetings;—still, at first,\r\nunder difficulties, in Gresham College, which was now the Exchequer.\r\nHooke and Croone were both enthusiastic over the “pretty experiments”\r\nof transfusion of blood: “one dog filled with another dog’s blood,” is\r\nPepys’s way of expressing it. Croone told Pepys that the performances at\r\nGresham College had given occasion for “many pretty wishes, as of the\r\nblood of a Quaker to be let into an Archbishop, and such-like.” The City\r\nwas still in a melancholy condition; it was difficult and dangerous to\r\nwalk about the ruins, with a link, after dark; but the “Greate Streetes”\r\nwere now being “marked out with piles, drove into the ground”; and people\r\nwere wondering why so many of the new Churches were to be built “in a\r\ncluster about Cornhill.” In January 1667, Gresham College being occupied\r\nby the Exchequer, Mr. Henry Howard, one of the Society’s most generous\r\nmembers, put rooms in Arundel House in the Strand at the disposal of the\r\nRoyal Society—\r\n\r\n“To the Royal Society,” says Evelyn, “which since the sad conflagration\r\nwere invited by Mr. Howard to sit at Arundel House in the Strand, who\r\nat my instigation likewise bestow’d on the Society that noble library\r\nwhich his grandfather especially and his ancestors had collected.\r\nThis gentleman had so little inclination to bookes, that it was the\r\npreservation of them from imbezzlement.”[316]\r\n\r\nIn May, the meetings of the Society were in full swing: May 30,\r\nespecially, must have been a gala occasion—\r\n\r\n“To London,” says Evelyn, “to wait on the Dutchess of Newcastle (who was\r\na mighty pretender to learning, poetrie and philosophie, and had in both\r\npublish’d divers bookes) to the Royal Society, whither she came in greate\r\npomp, and being receiv’d by our Lord President at the Dore of our meeting\r\nroome, the mace, etc., carried before him, had several experiments shewed\r\nto her. I conducted her Grace to her coach, and return’d home.”\r\n\r\nPepys gives a better account: The Duchess had invited herself; and there\r\nhad been “much debate, pro and con, it seems many being against it, and\r\nwe do believe the town will be full of ballads of it.” In the end,\r\ngallantry prevailed among the Philosophers; and when Pepys arrived at\r\nArundel House on foot, after his noonday dinner—it was a very hot and\r\ndusty day—he found “very much company” in decorous expectation of her\r\nGrace. She came, with her attendant women—among them the “Ferabosco,” of\r\nwhose beauty there had been so much talk among the gallants. The Duchess\r\nherself, in her “antick” dress, disappointed Pepys: “nor did I hear her\r\nsay anything that was worth hearing, but that she was full of admiration,\r\nall admiration.”\r\n\r\nThe Philosophers showed her all their best experiments—“of colours,\r\nloadstones, microscopes, and of liquors.” The _chef d’œuvre_ seems to\r\nhave been the turning of a piece of roasted mutton into pure blood,\r\n“which was very rare,” says Pepys; and then the Duchess and her suite\r\nwere escorted to her coach again, her Grace still crying that she was\r\n“full of admiration.”\r\n\r\nThat was in May. Before the end of June poor Henry Oldenburg was suddenly\r\nclapped into the Tower. The news must have fallen like a thunderbolt at\r\nthe next Wednesday afternoon meeting of the Society. Their Secretary was\r\nin jail.\r\n\r\n“I was told yesterday,” wrote Pepys, on June 25th, “that Mr. Oldenburg,\r\nour Secretary at Gresham College, is put into the Tower, for writing\r\nnews to a virtuoso in France, with whom he constantly corresponds on\r\nphilosophical matters: which makes it very unsafe at this time to write,\r\nor almost to do anything.”[317]\r\n\r\nOldenburg was still in custody on August 8 when Evelyn called at the\r\nTower.\r\n\r\n“Visited Mr. Oldenburg, now close prisoner in the Tower, being suspected\r\nof writing intelligence. I had an order from Lord Arlington, Secretary of\r\nState, which caus’d me to be admitted. This Gentleman was Secretary to\r\nour Society, and I am confident will prove an innocent person.”\r\n\r\nAnd indeed Oldenburg was soon to be set free. On September 3 he was once\r\nmore in his own home and writing to Robert Boyle at Oxford—\r\n\r\n“I was so stifled by the prison air,” says Oldenburg, “that as soon as\r\nI had my enlargement from the _Tower_ I widened it, and took it from\r\n_London_ into the Country, to fan myself for some days in the good air of\r\n_Craford_ in _Kent_. Being now returned, and having recovered my stomach,\r\nwhich I had in a manner quite lost, I intend, if God will, to fall to my\r\nold trade,[318] if I have any support to follow it.”\r\n\r\nOnce again, evidently, the Boyle family had done their best for a Puritan\r\nfriend in trouble. “I have learnt during this Commitment,” says Oldenburg\r\nto Boyle, “to know my real friends. God Almighty bless them, and enable\r\nme to convince them all of my gratitude. Sir, I acknowledge and beg\r\npardon for the importunities I gave you at the beginning; assuring you\r\nthat you cannot lay any commands on me that I shall not cheerfully obey\r\nto the best of my power.”\r\n\r\nBut the news of Oldenburg’s release—though Boyle must have been glad to\r\nhear of it—had come at an anxious time. A few days before Boyle received\r\nOldenburg’s letter the Lord Chancellor Clarendon had been required to\r\nresign the Seals. The Boyle family must have known something of what was\r\nhappening: the Burlingtons and the Clarendons were next-door neighbours\r\nin the two great palaces in Piccadilly, and their children were\r\nmarried,—“Lory Hide” to Henrietta Boyle.\r\n\r\n“Dear Broghill”—now my Lord Orrery—had been in England by the King’s\r\nwish for some little time, having left Munster under the care of a\r\nVice-President. “Lord Orrery,” says his chaplain, Dr. Morrice, quaintly,\r\n“saw thoroughly into the tempers of people and the consequences of\r\nthings.” And he had foreseen Clarendon’s fall, and had already warned\r\nClarendon in vain. In August, Lady Clarendon had died: “the mother of\r\nall his children and the companion in all his banishment, and who had\r\nmade all his former calamities less grievous by her company and courage.”\r\nLady Clarendon had been buried in Westminster Abbey; and alone, in his\r\nnew palace, among his pictures and books, the widower had received his\r\nMajesty’s visit of condolence. And then, only a few days later, had come\r\nthe King’s message, carried by the Chancellor’s son-in-law the Duke of\r\nYork. It was desirable “on various grounds, but especially for his own\r\nsafety,” that Clarendon should resign the Seals.\r\n\r\nDuring the next day or two the Duke of York, the Duchess—Clarendon’s\r\ndaughter—and Archbishop Sheldon, and various other people, interceded for\r\nClarendon with the King. And on the morning of August 26 Clarendon was\r\nsent for to Whitehall. The audience lasted two hours, in the King’s own\r\nchamber, and then the Chancellor was dismissed and departed, “looking\r\nsad,” through the private garden of Whitehall, which was “full of people”\r\nwaiting to see him come out. Lady Castlemaine, in her smock, looked down\r\nupon the garden from her aviary window, laughing with the gallants below,\r\nand “blessing herself at the old man’s going.”\r\n\r\nNext day Evelyn called on the Chancellor at his house in Piccadilly. “I\r\nfound him,” says Evelyn, “in his bedchamber, very sad.” The tide had\r\nturned against him: the Parliament had accused him, and he had enemies\r\nat Court; “especialy the buffoones and ladies of pleasure, because he\r\nthwarted some of them and stood in their way.”\r\n\r\nAll this is old reading: the fall of Clarendon is a chapter of British\r\nhistory. But it is not quite so well known that Lord Orrery, “dear\r\nBroghill,” the uncle of “Lory Hide’s” wife, was asked to take the seals\r\nthat Clarendon had been forced to give up. According to Morrice, the\r\nDuchess of York appealed to Lord Orrery to take the seals and heal the\r\nbreach between the King and the Duke, whose suspected papacy was “against\r\nhim.” And then the Duke tried to persuade Lord Orrery; and lastly the\r\nKing himself offered him the Chancellorship. But Broghill’s had always\r\nbeen a “well-armed head”; and now that he was Lord Orrery he knew his\r\nKing—and he knew his gout; and he made his gout serve as an excuse for\r\ndeclining the honour offered him by his King. “I am a decrepit man,” he\r\nsaid to the Duchess of York; but he took a turn or two in his coach,\r\nin the park, planning what could be done to make the King and the Duke\r\nagree, and thinking what a pity it was that Clarendon had been so\r\nimperious—even towards the King himself.\r\n\r\nSo far Morrice. Lord Orrery went back to Ireland, and Sir Orlando\r\nBridgeman was the new Chancellor: “the man of the whole nation that is\r\nbest spoken of, and will please most people,” says the fickle Pepys, who\r\nhad himself, such a little while before, been “mad in love with my Lord\r\nChancellor.”\r\n\r\nIn October Lord Orrery’s new play, _The Black Prince_, was produced at\r\nthe King’s Theatre. The house was “infinite full,” the King and Duke\r\nthere, and not a seat to be got by Mr. Pepys in the pit, so that he was\r\nobliged to pay four shillings for a seat in the upper boxes, “the first\r\ntime ever I sat in a box in my life.” In November and December both\r\nHouses were “very busy about my Lord Chancellor’s impeachment,” and Lory\r\nHide was going about saying that if he thought his father had done only\r\none of the things that were being said against him, he, Lory Hide, would\r\nbe “the first that should call for judgment against him”, which Mr.\r\nWaller, the poet, “did say was spoke like the old Roman—like Brutus—for\r\nits greatness and worthiness.”\r\n\r\nOn December 3, Henry Oldenburg, back at his work as Secretary of the\r\nRoyal Society, was writing to Boyle of the “grand affair,” the wrangle of\r\nLords and Commons over the terms of Clarendon’s impeachment. And the same\r\nletter announced that the Royal Society had “greatly applauded” Boyle’s\r\nrecently communicated _Experiments of Light_; and that at the Anniversary\r\nMeeting of the Society, on St. Andrew’s Day, Boyle had been elected one\r\nof the new Council—“a very numerous meeting ... never so great a one\r\nbefore.” Boyle was then still in Oxford; but Evelyn, the Chancellor’s\r\nold friend, had been calling again at the great house in Piccadilly: “To\r\nvisit the late Lord Chancellor. I found him in his garden at his new\r\nbuilt Palace, sitting in his gowt wheele-chayre, and seeing the gates\r\nsetting up towards the North and the fields. He look’d and spoke very\r\ndisconsolately ... next morning I heard he was gon....”\r\n\r\nClarendon, by the King’s orders, had hurriedly escaped to France, to\r\nbe followed into exile by an Act of Parliament banishing him for life.\r\nClarendon was gone; and the “Cabal” administration had begun.[319]\r\n\r\nIf the year 1667 ended anxiously for the Boyle family, the year 1668\r\nwas to prove more anxious still. Lord Orrery had returned to Ireland to\r\ntake up his presidency of Munster, and was living in great splendour at\r\nCharleville; but he and the Lord Lieutenant, Ormonde, disagreed; and in\r\nthe autumn of 1668 Lord Orrery had resigned the presidency and was back\r\nin England. He had “been advised,” says Morrice, “that his credit at\r\nCourt had begun to decline,” and that it would be wise for him to be on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nHe was very much on the spot when Pepys met him, in October, at Lord\r\nArlington’s house. In spite of his gout, the urbanity of the Boyle family\r\nhad not forsaken him. He “took notice” of Pepys, and began a “discourse\r\nof hangings, and of the improvement of shipping”; and Pepys presently\r\ndiscovered that Lord Orrery was paying “a mighty compliment” to his\r\nabilities and ingenuity, “which I am mighty proud of, and he do speak\r\nmost excellently.”\r\n\r\nBut later in November came a rude awakening. It was now my Lord Orrery’s\r\nturn to be impeached in the House of Commons, “for raising of moneys by\r\nhis own authority upon his Majesty’s subjects.”\r\n\r\nWhen the summons came, Lord Orrery was laid up with a severe attack\r\nof gout; and when he was well enough, a few days later, to answer the\r\nsummons in person, he could scarcely manage to get up the steps from\r\nWestminster Hall to the Court of Request. A friend, passing by, remarked\r\nthat my Lord of Orrery walked with difficulty and pain. “Yes, sir,” said\r\nOrrery, “my feet are weak; but if my heels will serve to carry me up, I\r\npromise you my head shall bring me safe down again.”\r\n\r\nAnd it did. He made an able defence—sitting, because of his gout; and\r\nat the psychological moment, so the story runs, the King put an end to\r\nthe proceedings by proroguing both Houses.[320] Impeachments might be\r\nas thick as blackberries; Lord Orrery might discourse cheerfully of\r\n“hangings” at a dinner party at Lord Arlington’s house; but, after all,\r\nit was only five-and-twenty years since the old Earl of Cork had died in\r\nharness with all his sons in the field. It would have been inconvenient\r\nto overlook such services and such sacrifices as the great Boyle family\r\nin Ireland had rendered to their Kings.\r\n\r\nNo further steps were to be taken against Lord Orrery. “I am glad the\r\nHouse dismissed that foolish impeachment against my Lord Orrery,” wrote\r\nMr. Stubbe, of Warwick, to Robert Boyle. Morrice says that, while the\r\naffair was in progress, Lady Pegg had been sent by her husband to Ireland\r\n“to secure the estates.” She had performed her mission “with great\r\ndexterity and expedition,” so that “if he had been impeached, his family\r\nwould have been safe.” As it was, Lord Orrery returned to Ireland and\r\nLady Pegg—to occupy himself with repairing his last great home of Castle\r\nMartyr, and to write his _Art of War_. And in December 1668 another new\r\nplay—_Tryphon_—a tragedy taken from the First Book of Maccabees, was\r\nproduced with great success at the Duke’s house. Mr. and Mrs. Pepys,\r\non this occasion, “put a bit of meat in their mouths” and hurried off,\r\nto find the theatre crowded, and to sit out the performance in the\r\neighteenpenny seats above-stairs—“mighty hot.”\r\n\r\nSo ended 1668. During the last half of the year, at any rate, Robert\r\nBoyle had been away from Oxford and in the family circle. It is probable\r\nthat he was not far from “dear Broghill” in his hour of trial. After the\r\nfamily anxiety on this brother’s account had quieted down, there came\r\nnews from Ireland that Lord Ranelagh was dead. His death can have brought\r\nlittle outward change to the house in the Mall. Dick Jones—whose life\r\nat Court with Grammont and the rest of the gallants must have caused\r\nLady Ranelagh many a heartache, had been for some time employed in Irish\r\npolitics and in Ireland. Ormonde had brought about a reconciliation\r\nbetween Lord Ranelagh and his son; and the young Pyrophilus had been\r\nmember for the county of Roscommon in the Irish Parliament before his\r\nfather’s death raised him to the Upper House. It is suggestive that\r\nLord Ranelagh’s nuncupative Will left the two unmarried daughters,\r\nElizabeth and Frances, a sum of money, subject to their marrying with\r\nthe consent of the eldest sister, Lady Mount-Alexander. It is a question\r\nwhether “the girls” received any money as a result of these nuncupative\r\npaternal intentions. Elizabeth, who became Mrs. Melster, must have\r\nbeen the heroine of a humble love-story, for her husband is described\r\nin the old peerages as a _valet de pé_. This did not mean exactly in\r\nthose times what it means to-day, nor was it exactly what might have\r\nbeen expected for a granddaughter of the Great Earl of Cork. And yet,\r\nit must be remembered that the old Elizabethan Peer had always about\r\nhim a little _entourage_ of cousin-commoners, as staunch as they were\r\nunobtrusive,—Naylors of Gray’s Inn and Croones of Cheapside.\r\n\r\nFrances, the delicate daughter—the baby born prematurely at the manor\r\nof Stalbridge—does not seem to have married at all. Lady Ranelagh had\r\nnursed “my poor Franck” through many illnesses—smallpox, of course, among\r\nthem. She suffered from headaches; and nothing did them so much good\r\nas the little packets of tea—a costly luxury in those days—that Lady\r\nRanelagh was able to procure for her by the kindness of the Oxford uncle.\r\nElizabeth and Frances were both probably still “the girls,” and living\r\nwith their mother, when Robert Boyle, in 1669, left Oxford for good.\r\nTheir uncle Robyn, the “deare Squire”—was long ago turned philosopher;\r\nsomething of a valetudinary; a virtuoso of an European fame. Philosophers\r\nof all nations flocked to see Mr. Boyle’s experiments. The Royal\r\nSociety—all intellectual London—was waiting for his coming.\r\n\r\nWith his books and instruments and standish—but, alas! no longer his bows\r\nand arrows—he once more, as in the old-young days of 1644, took up his\r\nresidence with Lady Ranelagh in the house in Pall Mall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE IN PALL MALL\r\n\r\n    “... Only this methinks I am sure of, that it is a brave thing\r\n    to be one of those, that shall lift up their heads with joy\r\n    in expectation of a present redemption, when all these ruins\r\n    and confusions shall be upon the Earth; and such brave men and\r\n    women are only true Christians. Therefore, my dear brother, let\r\n    us endeavour for that dignity, though in maintaining it we take\r\n    courses, that have the contempt of the world heaped upon them;\r\n    for to be contemned by the contemptible is glorious in the\r\n    opinion of your K. R.”—LADY RANELAGH to ROBERT BOYLE, September\r\n    14 (1653?).\r\n\r\n    “The Book of Nature is a fine and large piece of tapestry\r\n    rolled up, which we are not able to see all at once, but\r\n    must be content to wait for the discovery of its beauty and\r\n    symmetry, little by little, as it gradually comes to be more\r\n    and more unfolded or displayed.”—ROBERT BOYLE, Second Part of\r\n    the _Christian Virtuoso_, Aphorism xxi.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intellectual atmosphere of Oxford, when Robert Boyle said good-bye to\r\nit, was not the same “ayre” that he had weighed so pleasantly in 1659.\r\nIndeed, he must have been rather glad to be out of it before the great\r\noccasion of the opening of the Sheldonian at the _Encænia_ of 1669.\r\nEvelyn, who was present, was scandalised, not only by the University\r\nOrator’s “malicious and indecent reflections on the Royal Society as\r\nundermining of the University,” but by the performance of the University\r\nBuffoone, “which, unless it be suppressed,” he says, “it will be of ill\r\nconsequences, as I afterwards plainly expressed my sense of it both to\r\nthe Vice-Chancellor[321] and severall heads of houses, who were perfectly\r\nashamed of it and resolved to take care of it in future.” The “old\r\nfacetious way” had given place to ribald and libellous attacks: “In my\r\nlife,” says Evelyn, “I was never witnesse of so shamefull entertainment.”\r\n\r\nBoyle’s old friend, Dr. Wallis, Professor of Mathematics, was equally\r\ndistressed. In fact, he wrote about it to Mr. Boyle in London. Wallis\r\nhad been one of those who objected to the fulsome wording of the\r\nproposed letter of thanks from the University to the Archbishop—a letter\r\nacknowledging Sheldon as their “Creator and Redeemer”: _non tantus\r\ncondere, hoc est creare, sed etiam redimere_.[322] And he was as angry\r\nwith the University Orator’s attack on “Cromwell, fanatics, the Royal\r\nSociety and the New Philosophy,” as he was at the abominable scurrilities\r\nof the University Buffoone. Real stage-plays, too, imported from the\r\nDuke’s House, had been acted in the Oxford Town Hall—and were less\r\nobjectionable than what had gone on in the Sheldonian.\r\n\r\nBut even Wallis seems to have been infected by the summer madness of\r\nthat _Encænia_ of 1669. He had been entertaining some of the guests at\r\nhis own house; Sir James Langham and his Lady, and other “persons of\r\nquality”; and in an after-dinner chat Sir James had been expatiating on\r\nthe qualities of “an excellent lady,” Lady Mary Hastings, sister to the\r\nEarl of Huntingdon—a lady for whom Sir James had a very great esteem.\r\nSo highly, indeed, did he think of “her temper, her parts, her worth,\r\nher virtue, her piety and everything else,” that he would have been\r\nquite willing to marry her himself except that she was his deceased\r\nwife’s sister, and that he was already married again. But Sir James\r\nthought—and Wallis concurred with him—that Lady Mary would make “not only\r\nan excellent wife, but an excellent wife for Esquire Boyle.” And Wallis\r\nwrote then and there to Boyle to offer to be “the happy instrument of\r\nmaking two so excellent persons happy in each other.”\r\n\r\nWallis may in his youth have studied cryptology; but in his middle age\r\nhe did not understand Robert Boyle. Lady Mary Hastings probably never\r\nknew of the future that had been so neatly mapped out for her in that\r\nafter-dinner chat. She married Sir William Joliffe, of Caverswell Castle,\r\nin Staffordshire. The Manor of Stalbridge stood empty; and Mr. Boyle went\r\non living in Pall Mall.\r\n\r\nBut if Oxford was changed of late years, so also was Pall Mall—very much\r\nchanged indeed since a certain dark evening of 1649, when Cromwell’s\r\n“sightly lieutenant,” carrying the message to Broghill, rode up to Lady\r\nRanelagh’s door. One of the first things that Charles II had done was to\r\nmake a new Mall in St. James’s Park, and to improve the Park itself—“now\r\nevery day more and more pleasant by the new works upon it,” wrote Pepys\r\nin January 1662. A river was made through the Park; and there on frosty\r\nwinter days Pepys stood to watch the gay groups “sliding with their\r\nskeates—which is a very pretty art.” The Duke of York was an accomplished\r\nskater, and the King was a great hand at the game of Mall.\r\n\r\n    “Here a well-polished Mall gives us the joy\r\n    To see our Prince his matchless force employ.\r\n    No sooner had he touch’d the flying ball\r\n    But ’tis already more than half the Mall.”[323]\r\n\r\nWhen Pepys stopped to have a talk with the keeper of the Mall—who was\r\n“sweeping of it” at the moment—he examined with interest its earthen\r\nflooring, spread with powdered cockle-shells. Evelyn, on the other hand,\r\ncared more about the birds and beasts that inhabited the Park—the “deare\r\nof severall countries,” the guinea-fowl and Arabian sheep; the pelican,\r\nand the melancholy waterfowl brought by the Russian Ambassador from\r\nAstracan; the Solan geese, and the pet crane with a real wooden leg—“made\r\nby a soldier.” Waller has described St. James’s Park “as lately improved\r\nby his Majesty”—\r\n\r\n    “Methinks I see the love that shall be made,\r\n    The lovers walking in that amorous shade;\r\n    The Gallants dancing by the riverside—\r\n    They bathe in summer and in winter slide.\r\n    Methinks I hear the music in the boats,\r\n    And the loud echo which returns the notes.\r\n    ...\r\n    The ladies angling in the crystal lake\r\n    Feast on the waters with the prey they take;\r\n    At once victorious with their lines and eyes\r\n    They make the fishes and the men their prize.”\r\n\r\nMr. Waller saw everything _couleur de rose_. “I know his calling as a\r\nPoet,” wrote Lady Ranelagh once to Robert Boyle, when Waller had been\r\npaying her one of his elaborate compliments, “gives him license to say\r\nas great things as he can without intending that they should signify\r\nanything more than that he said them.”[324] And it is possible some\r\nof the older inhabitants of Pall Mall did not look so kindly on the\r\n“improvements” in St. James’s Park.\r\n\r\nThe old Mall, and the old game that was played there, dated back to James\r\nI. There was a “Pell Mell Close” planted with apple-trees that gave the\r\nname to Apple-Tree Yard, St. James’s Square. The houses had been built on\r\nboth sides of the Old Mall;—“The Pall Mall,” as it was called, or “Pall\r\nMall Walk,” or “The Pavement.” Its double row of seventy elm trees—140\r\ntrees in all—running its length, from the Haymarket to St. James’s, may\r\nwell have been the “living gallery of aged trees,” in Waller’s poem of\r\n1661. Lady Ranelagh’s house was one of those on the south side, at the\r\nwest end, of the Mall; houses advertised as “on the Park side, with\r\nGardens or Mounts adjoining to the Royal Gardens.” There were various\r\ninteresting inhabitants of the Mall about the time that Boyle went to\r\nlive there with Lady Ranelagh. Dr. Sydenham, the fashionable London\r\nphysician, had been living there since 1658—an old friend of theirs:\r\none of the great Dorsetshire Puritan family of Sydenhams, of whom\r\nthe doctor’s brother, the Parliamentarian Colonel Sydenham, was the\r\nchief. Mrs. Knight the singer, and Dr. Isaac Barrow the divine, and the\r\nnotorious Countess of Southesk who figures in the Memoirs of Grammont,\r\nwere all living in the Mall. There were taverns, too, and shops, with\r\nsignboards: “The King’s Head,” and “The Two Golden Balls.” And Pall Mall\r\nwas Clubland, even then: “Wood’s at the Pell Mell, our old house for\r\nclubbing,” wrote Pepys in 1660. But in 1670, after Boyle went to live\r\nthere, it was still a rural, leafy little suburb of fashionable London,\r\nbetween Whitehall and St. James’s Palace, nestled among the old trees,\r\nunder the very shadow of Westminster Abbey and Westminster Palace; the\r\nPainted Chamber, and the Star Chamber, and St. Stephen’s Chapel—“_That\r\nhouse where all our ills were shaped_,” as Waller called it,—after the\r\nRestoration. So rural was the Old Mall, that Dr. Sydenham used to sit\r\nsmoking his pipe at his open window looking on to the Pavement, with a\r\nsilver tankard of ale on the window-sill; and when once a thief ran off\r\nwith the doctor’s tankard, thief and tankard alike were lost “in the\r\nbushes of Bond Street.”[325]\r\n\r\nIn 1669, Nell Gwynne was living on the north side, and at the east end,\r\nof the Mall, next door to Lady Mary Howard; but in 1671, she crossed\r\nover to a house on the Park side of Pall Mall, the leasehold of which\r\nhad been given her by Charles II; and there, from this time till her\r\ndeath in 1687, “Maddam Elinor Gwyn” was living, only two doors off from\r\nLady Ranelagh and Robert Boyle. Those strips of back gardens, with\r\n“raised mounts” in them looking over to the Royal Gardens, were very near\r\ntogether. Did Boyle, whose laboratory was at the back of Lady Ranelagh’s\r\nhouse, see Mrs. Nellie on her mount, talking to the King who stood\r\nlooking up at her from the green walk below? Evelyn was in attendance\r\nthat day. “I both saw and heard,” wrote Evelyn afterwards in his diary,\r\n“a very familiar discourse between [the King] and Mrs. Nellie, as they\r\ncal’d an impudent comedian, she looking out of her garden on a terrace\r\nat the top of the wall, and [the King] standing on yᵉ greene walke under\r\nit....”[326]\r\n\r\nBut that was in May 1671; and by that time Robert Boyle had been very\r\nill for eleven months, and was only beginning to recover. The year\r\n1669, and part of 1670, had been very busy. Besides his contributions\r\nto the Royal Society’s _Transactions_, he had published further work\r\non the _Spring and Weight of the Air_, and a second edition of his\r\n_Physiological Essays_. Du Moulin’s translation of the _Devil of Mascon_,\r\nwith Boyle’s introduction, had appeared; and Boyle was using all his\r\ninfluence, personal and literary, to heal the feud between the Royal\r\nSociety and the Universities, in which Sprat and Glanville, Stubbe,\r\nCrosse, and others, were taking sides. And in 1670 there appeared\r\nBoyle’s _Tracts about the Cosmical Qualities of Things_, better known by\r\nthe delightful title of “Cosmical Suspicions.” Boyle was at this time\r\nat the height of his scientific and literary popularity: “Mr. Boiles\r\nStyll” meant very much to the intellectual London of that day. It had\r\nits disciples, and it had its critics. Evelyn has spoken of “those\r\nincumbrances” in it “which now and then render the way a little tedious”;\r\nand there were people who thought that in his literary style Mr. Boyle\r\nwas not quite so happy as in his experiments.[327]\r\n\r\nAnd even in these experiments, one pair of eyes, at least, was fixed\r\nupon Robert Boyle; eyes that saw as far as, and perhaps a little further\r\nthan, even Boyle’s. Isaac Newton—the boy who had jumped against the\r\nwind in that terrific storm that raged over England when Cromwell lay\r\ndying—was only twenty-nine in 1671; but he was already professor of\r\nmathematics at Cambridge, and a Fellow of the Royal Society. It was six\r\nyears since he had noticed the traditional apple fall to earth in his\r\nmother’s orchard in Lincolnshire. He himself had been tempted to seek\r\nafter the philosopher’s stone; and when in 1676 Isaac Newton read in the\r\n_Transactions_ of Boyle’s “uncommon experiment about the incalescence\r\nof gold and mercury,” it was in the finest spirit, as one of Boyle’s\r\nsincerest “honourers,” that Newton wrote to Oldenburg, the secretary.\r\nHe felt that “the fingers of many will itch to have the knowledge of\r\nthe preparation of such a mercury; and for that end some may not be\r\nwanting to move for the publishing of it, by urging the good it may\r\ndo in the world. But, in my simple judgment, the noble author, since\r\nhe has thought fit to reveal himself so far, does prudently in being\r\nreserved in the rest.” Newton gave his reasons for doubting this theory\r\nof the transmutation of metals: he foreshadowed the “immense damage to\r\nthe world” that might come from proceeding further with it. “I question\r\nnot,” he says of Boyle’s experiments, “but that the great wisdom of the\r\nnoble author will _sway him to silence_ till he shall be resolved of what\r\nconsequence they may be.” It was because Boyle himself seemed “desirous\r\nof the sense of others in this point” that Newton had “been so free as to\r\nshoot my bolt.”\r\n\r\nIsaac Newton’s “bolt” took effect, though it must have cost Boyle\r\nsomething to give up that little bit of research; for he had been, so to\r\nspeak, rolling a little ball of quicksilver and gold-dust in the palm\r\nof his hand ever since the year 1652, when he was only five-and-twenty;\r\npressing it a little with the fingers of the other hand, till it grew\r\n“sensibly and considerably hot,” and timing the “incalescence” by a\r\nminute clock. He was to hover about the subject for a time, but in the\r\nend, he was to follow Newton’s advice. If these two men could be present\r\nat a meeting of the Royal Society in Burlington House to-day! Their\r\ntwo portraits are on its walls. Their two faces look down on modern\r\nexperimental science. Their self-restraint has had its reward.\r\n\r\nAlready, in 1670, Boyle was at the height of his literary and scientific\r\npopularity, the acknowledged chief of the circle of New Philosophers\r\nin London. He had long been a valetudinary, saving his strength for\r\nhis work, and holding himself aloof from uncongenial company. And he\r\nwas now beginning to enjoy the ease and dignity of home life, a clever\r\nwoman’s ministrations and companionship, and the thousand-and-one little\r\namenities of a home that his bachelor life in his Oxford lodgings must\r\nhave lacked. But in June 1670 he had been taken suddenly ill; “a severe\r\nparalytic distemper”, it was called; and eleven months later, in May\r\n1671, he was writing a pathetic little letter to his old Dorsetshire\r\nfriend, John Mallet of Poynington, describing in his own gentle words his\r\ninvalid condition. “I have taken so many medicines,” he wrote, “and found\r\nthe relief they awarded me so very slow, that it is not easy for me to\r\ntell you what I found most good by. The things which to me seem fittest\r\nto be mentioned on this occasion are that cordial medicines, especially\r\nsuch as peculiarly befriend the _genus nervosum_, were very frequently\r\nand not unsuccessfully administered ... that the dried flesh of vipers\r\nseemed to be one of the usefullest cordials I took; but then I persevered\r\nin taking it daily for a great while. That I seldom missed a day without\r\ntaking the air, at least once, and that even when I was at the weakest,\r\nand was fain to be carried in men’s arms from my chair into the coach.\r\nThat the best thing I found to strengthen my feet and legs, and which I\r\nstill use, was sack turned to a brine with sea-salt and well rubbed upon\r\nthe parts every morning and night with a warm hand....”\r\n\r\nBoyle’s own doctor was Edmund King—not then Sir Edmund and the King’s\r\nPhysician, but a London practitioner of repute, living in Hatton Gardens;\r\na year or two younger than Boyle; a member of the Royal Society; a friend\r\nof Willis and Petty, and a great man for dissections and experiments.\r\nIt was Edmund King who was so interested in the first transfusion\r\nexperiments on human subjects, and who, “with my best microscope,”\r\nnoticed the appearance of living organisms in “things left in water.”\r\nAnd it is to be remembered that in a list of Boyle’s lost manuscripts\r\nthere is one with the title “Spontaneous Generation.” It is possible that\r\nhe and Dr. King may have been working together with the microscope. The\r\n“viper powder” was one of Dr. King’s prescriptions, though he is said to\r\nhave preferred the “volatile salt.” It was not till some years later that\r\nDr. King gained such celebrity by his prompt action in bleeding Charles\r\nII after his apoplectic seizure. He had a lancet in his pocket; and no\r\nother doctor was at hand.\r\n\r\nBoyle recovered from his paralytic distemper, though very slowly. Whether\r\nit was the cordial of viper’s flesh, or the ministration of a warm human\r\nhand, he did regain strength, and was able once more to take up his work\r\nand resume his London life—always afterwards more or less the life of\r\na studious invalid. “It has plainely astonish’d me,” says Evelyn, “to\r\nhave seene him so often recover, when he has not been able to move, or\r\nbring his hand to his mouth: and indeede the contexture of his body,\r\nduring the best of his health, appear’d to me so delicate, that I have\r\nfrequently compar’d him to a chrystal or Venice glasse which, tho’\r\nwrought never so thin and fine, being carefully set up, would outlive the\r\nharder metals of daily use: And he was with all as clear and candid: not\r\na blemish or spot to tarnish his reputation.”\r\n\r\nThe mere number of Boyle’s publications during these years is remarkable,\r\neven though much of the work for them had been done before, and had\r\nonly to be arranged for publication. They dealt with the Usefulness of\r\nExperimental Natural Philosophy; the Origin and Virtue of Gems; Fire,\r\nFlame, and Effluviums; the Pressure of Solids and Fluids, and the\r\nWeighing of Water; the Properties of Sea Water, and its Distillation;\r\nthe Mechanical Causes of Heat and Cold, Volatility and Precipitation\r\nand Corrosiveness; the Production of Tastes; the Hypothesis of Alkali\r\nand Acidum, and the effects of atmospheric conditions “even on men’s\r\nsickness and health.” And there was always the other _facet_ to Boyle’s\r\nintellectual nature. While he was writing of all these and other things,\r\nwhile he was wrapped up in Suspicions—about the hidden qualities of\r\nair, celestial magnets and attraction by suction, statical hygroscopes,\r\nlaudanum, and air-bladders, and “quicksilver turning hot with gold,”—he\r\nwas also deep in meditations of the “Excellence of Theology compared with\r\nNatural Philosophy.” Both had always seemed to him to be the “Objects of\r\nMen’s Study.” He held tenaciously to the “Reconcilableness of Reason and\r\nReligion”; and his theological treatises were to run parallel with his\r\nphilosophical transactions.\r\n\r\nThe later chapters of biography are of necessity a chronicle of losses.\r\nThe death of the great admiral, the Earl of Sandwich, at the battle\r\nof Solebay, on May 28, 1672, removed the other splendid father-in-law\r\nof the Burlington family. His funeral, “by water to Westminster, in\r\nsolemn pomp,” must have affected the inmates of the house in Pall Mall\r\nas well as the families in the two Piccadilly palaces. “They will not\r\nhave me live,” Lord Sandwich had said sadly to Evelyn, before he sailed.\r\nIt is very certain that the whole trend of politics at this time—the\r\ncrypto-catholic movement, burrowing its way into Protestant England;\r\nthe _capuchins_ flitting about between Whitehall and St. James’s; the\r\nalliance with the French against the Dutch, and the prolonged war with\r\nHolland; the plottings and placings of the _Cabal_, and the quarrels and\r\nchanges in the royal harem, which had pushed up to the very door of the\r\nhouse in Pall Mall—must have been utterly distasteful to Robert Boyle and\r\nhis passionately Puritan sister.\r\n\r\nPoor Charles Rich, my Lord of Warwick, who had been ill for a long time,\r\ndied at Leeze in 1673, leaving Mary, a childless great lady, still\r\nsurrounded by chaplains, to administer her husband’s property and to see\r\nall the three “sweet young ladies,” her nieces, married to satisfactory\r\nhusbands of her own choosing.\r\n\r\nA more personal loss to Robert Boyle was the sudden death of Henry\r\nOldenburg in September 1677. He and another old friend, Dr. Worsley\r\nof the “mountain-bellied conceptions” for the good of mankind, died\r\nalmost at the same time. Oldenburg had worked hard for the Royal Society\r\nsince he came out of the Tower in the autumn of 1667. He had carried\r\nthe Society through the troublesome time that followed the Fire of\r\nLondon, after the loss of its _Transactions_ and during its sojourn in\r\nArundel House. He had seen it reinstated in Gresham College, and a great\r\ncollation given in its honour by the Mayor and Aldermen of the City of\r\nLondon. He had been overworked and underpaid, and had added to the small\r\ngains he made out of the Society’s _Transactions_[328] by doing a good\r\ndeal of work for Boyle personally, in proof-correcting and in translating\r\nBoyle’s books into Latin. And Boyle had tried to obtain for him the Latin\r\nSecretaryship—the very post that Milton had held—but in this he had\r\nfailed. One of the last glimpses of Oldenburg and Boyle together is at\r\na little scientific supper-party in February 1676, given by Sir Joseph\r\nWilliamson, who later became President of the Royal Society when Lord\r\nBrouncker resigned. Boyle was well enough to be at this supper-party;\r\nand Evelyn and Wren and Petty and one or two others were there, and “our\r\nSecretary, Mr. Oldenburg.”[329] Lady Ranelagh was away from home on a\r\nvisit when the news of Oldenburg’s death reached her; and, knowing how\r\nmuch her brother would feel his death, she wrote Boyle one of her most\r\ncomfortable letters, and made arrangements to return home at once.[330]\r\nAnd as Oldenburg had died without making a will, and his wife (his second\r\nwife, daughter of John Durie) died just before or just after him, Robert\r\nBoyle himself took care of their children, left poorly provided for and\r\nwithout relations in this country. The boy had been named “Rupert,” after\r\nthe scientific Prince.\r\n\r\nMary, Countess of Warwick, survived her husband just five years. Her\r\ndeath at Leeze, in 1678, must have closed a chapter in the life of the\r\nsister and brother in Pall Mall. Lady Ranelagh had been with Mary in\r\nall her hours of trial—and they had been so many—the little, “unrewly”\r\nsister! Lady Ranelagh had been at Stalbridge when the Earl of Cork was so\r\nangry because Mary dismissed Mr. James Hamilton; it was Lady Ranelagh who\r\nhad accompanied Charles and Mary to Leeze after their runaway marriage,\r\nand stayed with them there till Mary had found her place in that\r\npatriarchal family. It was Lady Ranelagh who had tended Mary in all her\r\nillnesses, and had taken Mary and Charles under her own roof after their\r\nson’s death. And Robert Boyle, too;—how tenderly romantic Mary had been\r\nwhen the “deare Squire” took refuge at delicious Leeze in the summer of\r\n1648, and she sat beside him while he wrote his _Seraphick Love_! How she\r\nhad wept over the pages as they were handed to her, the ink scarcely dry!\r\n\r\nBut an even greater loss was to come in Broghill’s, my Lord of Orrery’s,\r\ndeath in 1679. He had been ill for a year or two, and back and forward\r\nbetween Ireland and England, in the hands of the physicians; but\r\notherwise he had been living the life of a great landowner on his Irish\r\nestates at Charleville and at Castle Martyr. His _Art of War_, dedicated\r\nto Charles II, had been published in 1677, and had met with a certain\r\nsuccess. He was to have written a continuation of it, if the first volume\r\nhad proved sufficiently popular. But warfare, like other things, has its\r\nfashions; and even warriors grow old: it was nearly forty years since the\r\n“Mortall Sowe” had done such good service on the walls of Lismore.\r\n\r\nLady Pegg was with her husband, his strong friend and helpmate, to the\r\nlast. The beautiful bride of Suckling’s wedding-ballad, with the slender\r\nring-finger and the bee-stung lip, was now surrounded by children, grown\r\nup and married, some of them, and with great homes of their own. But Lady\r\nPegg was beautiful and comfortable still. “A rose in autumn,” as old Lord\r\nGoring used to say, “is as sweet as a rose in June.” There is no doubt\r\nthat Broghill, the soldier-statesman and dramatist—“my dearest Governor,”\r\nas Robert Boyle called him—was the favourite brother, and that Lady\r\nPegg was the chief of sisters-in-law, “the great support, ornament and\r\ncomfort” of her family.\r\n\r\nOn St. Andrew’s Day 1680 Boyle was elected President of the Royal\r\nSociety. The anniversary meeting and the dinner that followed it had\r\nbrought a large gathering of the philosophers together. Evelyn was\r\nthere, and his diary records the election of “that excellent person and\r\ngreate Philosopher Mr. Robert Boyle, who indeede ought to have been the\r\nvery first; but neither his infirmities nor his modestie could now any\r\nlonger excuse him.” But Evelyn omits to mention that Boyle declined\r\nthe presidency. He had an insuperable objection to tests and oaths. He\r\ntook Counsel’s opinion in the matter, and he wrote to his old assistant\r\nHooke,[331] explaining his “great (and perhaps peculiar) tenderness in\r\npoint of oaths”; asking Hooke to convey his thanks to the Society, but\r\nbegging them to “proceed to a new election.”\r\n\r\nLess and less able now to attend the meetings of the Society, Boyle was\r\ngradually to withdraw also from the meetings of the East India Company,\r\nof which he was a Director, and of the Society for the Propagation of the\r\nGospel, of which he was Governor. More and more did he retire into his\r\nquiet home-life in the house in Pall Mall, which had been enlarged to\r\nsuit his purposes. There is no mention of him at the famous supper-party\r\nof the Royal Society, at which everything was cooked in Monsieur Papin’s\r\nDigestors—that “philosophical supper” which caused so much mirth and\r\n“exceedingly pleas’d all the company.” He is more likely to have been\r\npresent a week or two later to see the Morocco Ambassador subscribe his\r\nname and titles in Arabic, on the occasion of his being admitted honorary\r\nmember of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nBoyle lived, indeed, much among his books and manuscripts, and in his\r\nlaboratory. With the help of an amanuensis, he carried on a large\r\ncorrespondence among the new philosophers of the Old World, and the\r\nChristian missionaries in the New. The New Englanders wrote to him as\r\ntheir fount of charity: “Right Honourable, charitable, indefatiguable,\r\nnursing father.” He had tried to spread the knowledge of the Bible in\r\nthe East, in Turkish and Arabic, and in the Malayan tongue; and the\r\npublication of the Irish Bible was one of the great interests of his\r\nlater years. While Narcissus Marsh[332] and others did the actual work\r\nof translation and dissemination in Ireland, Robert Boyle in Pall Mall\r\npromoted it “with his influence and purse”; and Boyle’s Irish Bible was\r\nto find its way into Gaelic Scotland also, before Scotland had a Gaelic\r\nBible of her own.[333]\r\n\r\nBut Boyle spent his money also in helping individual cases—people whose\r\nlots were less happy than he thought they deserved; poor hard-worked\r\nclergy; the “distress’d refugees of France and Ireland”; and “learned men\r\nwho were put to wrestle with necessities.” He did this, very quietly,\r\nfor many years—usually by the hands of one or two personal friends in\r\nwhose discretion he could trust. Gilbert Burnet, in those latter years,\r\nwas one of these friends; and Burnet’s own _History of the Reformation_\r\nwould never have been published without Boyle’s assistance. So quietly\r\ndid Boyle dispense his charities that sometimes the very men so helped\r\ndid not know from whence the help came; but Burnet says that for years\r\nBoyle spent on this form of charity more than £1000 a year, which would\r\nmean more than three times that sum to-day. And he gave impartially,\r\nwithout thought of race or creed, holding himself to be “a part of the\r\nhuman nature, a debtor to the whole race of men.” Perhaps his especial\r\n_protégés_ were those who had suffered for their religious and political\r\nconvictions. A story of any kind of persecution would bring a flush\r\nof anger and distress to his gentle face, and words of the deepest\r\nindignation to lips which rarely opened to “speak against men.”\r\n\r\nEach year saw the publication of new tracts and treatises, and revised\r\neditions. They follow each other almost too quickly for enumeration.\r\nHis _Discourse of Things above Reason: inquiring whether a philosopher\r\nshould admit there are any such_, appeared in 1681; his _Memoirs of the\r\nNatural History of the Human Blood_, in 1684. That was the winter of the\r\nGreat Frost, 1683-4, when all London bivouacked and made merry on the\r\nfrozen Thames, and the smallpox was “very mortall.” It must have been\r\na trying winter for the invalid philosopher; for London “by reason of\r\nthe excessive coldnesse of the aire hindering the ascent of the smoke,\r\nwas so fill’d with the fuliginous steame of the sea-coale that hardly\r\ncould one see crosse the streetes, and thro’ filling the lungs with its\r\ngrosse particles exceedingly obstructed the breast, so as one could\r\nscarcely breathe.”[334] And there was no water to be had from pipes or\r\nengines; the birds and beasts died in the parks, the breweries were at a\r\nstandstill, and fuel was exorbitantly dear.\r\n\r\nThe treatise _Of the High Veneration Man’s Intellect Owes to God_\r\nappeared in 1685, and _A Free Enquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion\r\nof Nature_ in 1686. _The Martyrdom of Theodora and of Didymus_, written\r\nin his youth, was revised and printed in 1687; and about this time\r\nBoyle was advertising among the _virtuosi_ for his lost and plagiarised\r\nmanuscripts, evidently with some intention of bringing out a collected\r\nedition of his works. The only collection hitherto had been a very\r\nincomplete Latin edition, published without his knowledge in Geneva, in\r\n1677. In 1690 he published his _Medicina Hydrostatica_, and the first\r\npart of _The Christian Virtuoso_;[335] and in 1691—the last year of his\r\nlife—his _Experimenta Observationes Physicæ_. Some of his writings, left\r\nwith his executors, were to appear posthumously; and he had deposited\r\nwith the secretaries of the Royal Society a sealed packet containing\r\nhis account of the making of phosphorus—not to be opened till after his\r\ndeath.[336]\r\n\r\nA busy life, to the last; but what a quiet life it was for the sister and\r\nbrother during those last momentous years, in the house in Pall Mall!\r\nHistory swept past them: Kings came and went, Cabinets changed, beautiful\r\nfaces faded, Parliaments were dissolved, creeds and parties wrangled and\r\nplotted, brave men—and women too—died on scaffolds and the gallows-tree\r\nand at the stake for political crimes. All the world knows about Lord\r\nRussell and Algernon Sidney; but it is sometimes forgotten that Mrs.\r\nLisle, the wife of a regicide, laid her head on the block for “harbouring\r\na rebel”, and that Elizabeth Gaunt, for the same political crime, was\r\nburned at Tyburn.[337] A new London grew up over the old ruins—new\r\nsteeples on old foundations—and fashionable new squares were built where\r\ngreen fields had been. And all the time a great and cumbrous Constitution\r\nwas raising itself over centuries of abuse and sacrifice—a nation’s blood\r\nand tears.\r\n\r\nEvents crowded the canvas: Charles II’s melodramatic ending; the\r\naccession of the bigot James II; Monmouth’s rising and execution; the\r\n“Bloody Assizes” of Judge Jeffreys, in Dorset and Somerset; James’s\r\nleague with the French; the revoking of the Edict of Nantes and the\r\nhorrible atrocities that followed. Catholicism spread its fibres\r\nthroughout England, permeating Army, Law Courts, Parliament and\r\nUniversity. Priests—Carmelites, Benedictines and Franciscans—walked about\r\nthe streets of London, and a huge Jesuit school was set up in the Savoy.\r\nIn Scotland, a Catholic was in command at Edinburgh Castle: in Ireland,\r\na Catholic was at the head of the Army, and thousands of Catholic Irish\r\nwere drafted into its ranks.[338]\r\n\r\nA boy was born to James II and Mary of Modena, and there were whispered\r\nstories of imposture and the historic warming-pan. Then Protestantism\r\nclosed up its ranks, the State Church and the Nonconformists combined in\r\nface of a common danger, and the hopes of Protestant England were fixed\r\nupon William and Mary. Another message carried from England to The Hague\r\nbrought another Prince to English shores, but this time “to intervene\r\nin arms for the restoration of English liberty and the protection of\r\nthe Protestant religion”. Another proclamation in London, but this time\r\nof an Anglo-Dutch Prince, and a Princess who was not only the daughter\r\nof James II but the granddaughter of Hyde, Earl of Clarendon. Another\r\nbloody rebellion in Ireland, another chapter of massacre and terrorism;\r\nbut this time it was Ulster, and the Ulster Scots, who were fighting\r\nfor Protestantism. Robert Boyle and Lady Ranelagh, growing old in the\r\nhouse in the Mall—two children of the great Elizabethan Puritan Earl of\r\nCork—had watched Munster pass again into the hands of the Catholic Irish;\r\nbut they lived just long enough to see William and Mary Sovereigns of\r\nEngland, and to have the tidings of the Siege of Londonderry and the\r\nBattle of the Boyne. One of the last reports of the Rebellion that can\r\nhave reached Lady Ranelagh was the taking of Athlone by the English:\r\nit must have brought back to her the early days of her married life,\r\nwhen Arthur Jones had carried her off to Athlone Castle, a beautiful,\r\nhigh-spirited girl of sixteen.\r\n\r\nAnd now she was seventy-six. To her, if to nobody else in the world,\r\nher philosopher brother, twelve years her junior, was still “Robyn”—the\r\n“Deare Squire.” There were some empty rooms and many memories in the\r\nhouse in Pall Mall; but the sister and brother were together, and it was\r\na hospitable and pleasant house, and open to many friends. Distinguished\r\nstrangers from many parts of the world came to pay their respects to\r\nMr. Boyle, the celebrated Sceptical Chymist and Christian _Virtuoso_,\r\nand his incomparable sister, the Lady Ranelagh, who for fifty years had\r\nlived “on the most public scene,” and “made the greatest figure in all\r\nthe revolutions of these kingdoms of any woman of that age.”[339] The\r\nLondon _virtuosi_—and there were bishops as well as mathematicians among\r\nthem—brought their latest literary and scientific gossip to the house in\r\nthe Mall. The elder brother, old Lord Burlington, was sometimes to be\r\nfound there, with a conversational statesman or two in tow, who could\r\nsuccessfully dodge the politics of the moment by indulging in such a\r\npleasant and safe topic as the _amours_ of Mary, Queen of Scots, with\r\n“the Italian favourite.”[340] Gilbert Burnet—that eloquent and happy\r\nScotsman south of the Tweed—sat at Mr. Boyle’s feet and took notes:\r\nhis bishopric was to come with the accession of William and Mary. Even\r\nPyrophilus must have looked in upon his mother and uncle now and then.\r\nDick’s fortunes were up; he was an important man, had grown fat and\r\nvery witty, and was building himself a fine house in Chelsea.[341] His\r\nmother’s portrait was to hang on the wall of his private closet, looking\r\nat him long after she was dead; outliving other loves.[342]\r\n\r\nMen and women of the younger generation of this great family were living\r\nround about Piccadilly, St. James’s, and Pall Mall. One niece especially,\r\nmy Lady Thanet, a married daughter of Lord and Lady Burlington, was a\r\n“greate virtuosa,” known in London Society as one who “used to speak much\r\nof her uncle.”[343] And Evelyn, the friend of nearly forty years, though\r\nhe was a good deal older than Boyle, still found his way from Deptford to\r\nPall Mall to visit the philosopher and his sister.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoons, Boyle was seldom without company; “neither did his\r\nseverer studys,” says Evelyn, “soure his conversation in the least.” He\r\nhad “the most facetious and agreeable conversation in the world among\r\nthe ladys, whenever he happen’d to be engag’d; and yet so very serious,\r\ncompos’d and contemplative at all other times; tho’ far from moroseness,\r\nfor indeede he was affable and civil rather to excesse, yet without\r\nformality.”[344]\r\n\r\nSo popular were Mr. Boyle’s cosmopolitan receptions that about the\r\nyear 1689 he was obliged to put a “board” on the door in Pall Mall,\r\nmentioning the days on which he was “at home.” And he actually printed an\r\nannouncement, beginning “Mr. Boyle finds himself obliged to intimate to\r\nthose of his friends and acquaintances who are wont to do him the honour\r\nof visiting him,” and going on to explain that his “skilful and friendly\r\nphysician, seconded by his best friends”, had strongly advised him not to\r\nsee quite so many people.[345]\r\n\r\nThe forenoons of Tuesdays and Fridays, therefore, “both foreign\r\npost-days,” and the afternoons of Wednesdays and Saturdays, he proposed\r\nin future to reserve for himself, “that he might have some time, both\r\nto recruit his spirits, to range his papers and fill up the _lacunæ_\r\nof them, and to take some care of his affairs in Ireland, which are\r\nvery much disordered, and have their face often changed by the public\r\ncalamities there.”[346]\r\n\r\nThe announcement seems to have had the desired effect. “The mornings,”\r\nsays Evelyn in his description of the daily routine of Boyle’s last\r\nyears, “after his private devotions, he usually spent in philosophic\r\nstudys and in his laboratory, sometimes extending them to night.” But he\r\ntold Evelyn he had quite given up reading by candle-light, on account\r\nof his eyes. His amanuensis used to read to him, and write from notes,\r\nor at his dictation; and “that so often in loose papers, pack’d up\r\nwithout method, as made him sometimes to seeke upon occasion, as himself\r\nconfesses in divers of his works.” And apparently Boyle was not more\r\ntidy than other learned men. “Glasses, potts, chymical and mathematical\r\ninstruments, books and bundles of papers, did so fill and crowd his\r\nbedchamber, that there was but just room for a few chaires, so as his\r\nwhole equipage was very philosophical, without formality.” Among the\r\nother rooms in the house there was a small library. Boyle did not want\r\nmore: “as learning more from men, real experiments, and in his laboratory\r\n(which was ample and well furnished) than from books.”[347]\r\n\r\nAnd the man himself, in these last years? He was “rather tall, and\r\nslender of stature, pale, and much emaciated.” Owing to his delicacy\r\nof constitution, “he had divers sorts of cloaks to put on when he\r\nwent abroad, and in this he governed himself by his thermometer.” His\r\nlittle difficulty of speech had never quite forsaken him. “In his first\r\naddresses, being to speake or answer,” says Evelyn, “he did sometimes\r\na little hesitate, rather than stam’er or repeate the same word;\r\nimputable to an infirmity which, since my remembrance, he had exceedingly\r\novercome. This, as it made him somewhat slow and deliberate, so after\r\nthe first effort, he proceeded without the least interruption in his\r\ndiscourse.”[348]\r\n\r\nIn diet and in habit, Robert Boyle was “extreamely temperate and plaine”;\r\nnor could Evelyn, in all their friendship, ever discover in him “the\r\nleast passion, transport, or censoriousnesse, whatever discourse, or the\r\ntimes, suggested:\r\n\r\n“All was tranquil, easy, serious, discreete and profitable, so as besides\r\nMr. Hobbes, whose hand was against everybody and admired nothing but his\r\nowne, Francis Linus excepted (who yet with much civility wrote against\r\nhim), I do not remember he had the least antagonist.”[349]\r\n\r\nThe brother and sister had both been ill in the late autumn of 1691,\r\nwhen Boyle wrote to Dr. Turberville at Salisbury, begging for a further\r\nprescription for his eyes. “Sight is a thing dear to all men,” he wrote,\r\nalmost apologetically, “and especially to studious persons.” His eyes\r\nhad been troubling him very much of late, especially by candle-light.\r\n“When the candles are newly snuffed,” wrote this great experimental\r\nphilosopher, “I see far better for a little while:” but they very soon\r\nwanted snuffing again.[350]\r\n\r\nEvelyn was out of town on December 23, when Lady Ranelagh died; and\r\nhe did not hear of her death, or of her brother’s serious illness\r\nimmediately after it, till it was too late. “For it was then,” says\r\nEvelyn, “he began evidently to droope apace.” When Evelyn returned\r\nto town, it was to stand by his old friend’s grave. Robert Boyle had\r\nsurvived his sister only seven days: he died on December 30, 1691.\r\n\r\nHe was buried near to Lady Ranelagh, in the Chancel of St.\r\nMartin’s-in-the-Fields.[351] Burnet, now Bishop of Salisbury, preached\r\nthe funeral sermon “with that eloquence natural to him on such and all\r\nother occasions,” taking for his text the words, “For God giveth to a\r\nman that is good in His sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy.”[352]\r\n“Something too,” says Evelyn, “was touched of his sister, the Lady\r\nRanelagh.” But indeed it was not necessary. Her intellect and character\r\nwere known to all those who stood about the grave. Her high standards\r\nand strong judgment would have been a gain to the statecraft of her day.\r\nBut she was a woman; and if for more than twenty years her life had been\r\na rich and beautiful thing as the sister of Robert Boyle, for nearly\r\nforty years before that she had been the brave but unhappy wife of Arthur\r\nJones—“the foulest churl in the Worlde.”\r\n\r\nBy Boyle’s own direction, his funeral was “without the least pomp”; but\r\nround his grave there stood, besides his own many relatives, “a greate\r\nappearance of persons of the best and noblest quality.”\r\n\r\nMost of his Irish lands were entailed, and went to the eldest brother,\r\nthe Earl of Burlington and Cork. “It does not afflict me,” so runs the\r\nwill, “that I have not children of my own to inherit my entailed lands,\r\nsince they are, by that defect, to return to him, the truly honoured head\r\nof our house and family.” The Manor of Stalbridge went to Frank, the Lord\r\nViscount Shannon, together with Robyn’s best watch and an affectionate\r\nmessage. Frank would notice that the Manor House had been kept up “for\r\nhis sake,” though Robyn had had no mind to live in it. Mrs. Melster,\r\nthe niece who had married the _valet de pé_, is included among Boyle’s\r\n“honoured and dear nieces,” and is remembered more sumptuously than the\r\nothers, not because there is any difference of affection, but because of\r\nher “peculiar circumstances.” There were other lands in Ireland, and many\r\nbequests and legacies to relatives, friends, and servants besides the\r\ncharitable bequests left in the hands of trustees.[353] “Our Society”\r\nand the happy days at Gresham College were not forgotten. Dr. King was\r\nto have a silver standish, and to Robert Hooke, the “perfecter” of the\r\nbeloved air-pump, was left “my best microscope, and my best loadstone.”\r\n\r\nWhen Robert Boyle made his will in the summer of 1691 he evidently had\r\nnot thought it possible that Lady Ranelagh would die before him. He had\r\nmade her one of his executors, and he had left her all his manuscripts\r\nand his “collections of receipts.” But he had left her something else.\r\nAt the very beginning of his will, first and foremost of all his worldly\r\npossessions, Robert Boyle puts a small ring:\r\n\r\n“And as touching my temporal estate, wherewith God of His goodness hath\r\nbeen pleased to endow me, I dispose thereof in manner and form following;\r\nthat is to say—\r\n\r\n“I give and bequeathe unto my dear sister, the Lady Katharine,\r\nViscountess Ranelagh, a small ring, usually worn by me on my left hand,\r\nhaving in it two small diamonds with an emerald in the middle, which ring\r\nbeing held by me, ever since my youth, in great esteem, and worn for\r\nmany years for a particular reason, not unknown to my said sister, the\r\nLady Ranelagh, I do earnestly beseech her, my said sister, to wear it in\r\nremembrance of a brother that truly honoured and most dearly loved her.”\r\n\r\nBut Lady Ranelagh was dead—seven days before Robert Boyle. What became\r\nof the small ring? And what was its story? Why had Boyle worn it on his\r\nleft hand ever since his youth, holding it in great esteem? Lady Ranelagh\r\nknew—and Lady Ranelagh was dead. What was the “particular reason”? The\r\nstory of the little ring, if not the ring itself, is buried in the\r\nChancel of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Lismore Papers, first series, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[2] _Philaretus._ Robert Boyle left a fragment of Autobiography, _An\r\nAccount of Philaretus (~i.e.~ Mr. R.
