The one a complement to the other. And so I offer \"Explorers\r\nInto Infinity,\" in no sense as a sequel to \"The Girl in the Golden\r\nAtom,\" for fictionally they have no connection, but rather as its\r\ncompanion story._\r\n\r\n_You will find here a complete theory of the material universe as I\r\nconceive it may perhaps really be. To my own imagination--and I think\r\nvery likely to your own--it is difficult to conceive of an infinite\r\ndistance beyond the stars--empty Space stretching out forever. Nor is\r\nEinstein more satisfying to me, rather less so, for out beyond the\r\nEinstein system of curved Space must lie something or nothing. It\r\nis the nothingness which puzzles me. I have tried vainly to imagine\r\na realm, infinitely large, of unending nothingness. Time is equally\r\npuzzling. I can conceive of eventful eons lying ahead of us; but rob\r\nthat time of its future events and I flounder. To me at least, the\r\nconception of Time with nothing ever happening anywhere is impossible.\r\nTo me also, an event presupposes the existence of something; and so,\r\nin my effort to imagine the infinitely large--Space illimitable, Time\r\nunending--I am forced to conceive what must fill that Space, what must\r\nhappen to create that time._\r\n\r\n_You may call this tale fantastic, weird, bizarre. Doubtless it is. But\r\nwith our most powerful microscopes reaching inward so tiny a distance\r\nto see no end in infinite smallness; our greatest telescopes groping\r\nfutilely out into largeness unending to our vision, what is left but\r\nour imagination? And that, at least, we can send winging into the\r\ninfinite!_\r\n\r\n_I would not have you fear from this foreword that my story may be some\r\npedantic, heavily technical exposition. It is not; for it is fiction\r\nonly--a romance with which to entertain you; an effort, by using\r\nfictional methods, to reduce theories purely imaginative into concrete\r\nform with as great a degree of plausibility as may be. It is this only\r\nI desire: to carry you with me as you read; to make plausible this\r\nflight of our imaginations momentarily set free from the tiny everyday\r\nuniverse which is all we have physically to envisage._\r\n\r\n                                                          RAY CUMMINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 1_\r\n\r\n                       FREEDOM IN TIME AND SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\nI was busy with the Martian mail which had just arrived when the\r\nmessage from Brett Gryce reached me. I did not apprehend that there\r\nwas anything of secrecy about it, since he was using the open air; yet\r\nthere was in his voice a note of tenseness and his summons was urgent.\r\n\r\n\"I can't come, Brett, until I get through the mail.\" I was rushed, and\r\nin a mood of ill-temper at the universe in general.\r\n\r\n\"When will that be?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. It's accursedly large. Most of it seems to call for\r\nradio distribution--these Martians are always in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come when you can,\" he said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Tonight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--tonight. No matter how late--I must see you, Frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll come,\" I said, and cut him off.\r\n\r\nIt was long past trinight, with dawn beginning to brighten the sky\r\nbeyond the masonry of lower Great-New York, when I had disposed of\r\nthose miserable Martian dispatches. The Gryces lived in the Southern\r\nPennsylvania area. My aerocar was at hand. I had rather planned to use\r\nit; but I was tired and in no mood for effort. I decided to take the\r\npneumatic, since there was a branch--little traveled, it is true--which\r\nwould drop me within some twenty kilometers of the Gryce home.\r\n\r\nThey gave me an individual cylinder, with a bed if I cared to sleep.\r\nI did not. I lay there wondering what Brett could want of me; pleased\r\nalso that I would see Francine--dear little Frannie. . . .\r\n\r\nOccasionally I would call the Director ahead. They are sometimes\r\ncareless in the switching of special individual cylinders; and I had\r\nno wish to pass the branch and find myself bringing up at some gulf\r\nterminal with half the morning getting back. Once I called Brett. He\r\nwould meet me with his aero at the end of the branch when I arrived.\r\nHe, too, reminded the Director. A surly sort of fellow; the Gryces had\r\nalready reported him to the General Traffic Staff of Great-London.\r\n\r\nI was not misdirected, however; but it was broad daylight when I\r\nemerged to find Brett impatiently awaiting me. And in a few minutes\r\nmore we were landing at the aero-stage beside the Gryce home.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple enough place--for all Dr. Gryce's reputed wealth.\r\nAn estate of a few kilometers, set in a heavy grove of trees with\r\na high metallic wall about it. The granite house itself was small,\r\nunpretentious. There were few outbuildings; one a large rectangular\r\naffair which vaguely I understood was a workshop. I had never been in\r\nit. I knew old Dr. Gryce was interested in science; in his day he had\r\nmaterially advanced civilization with several fundamental devices. But\r\nwhat--if anything--he might be doing now, I had no idea.\r\n\r\nBrett would tell me nothing beyond the fact that his father had\r\nsuggested they send for me. But he seemed excited, tense. Dr. Gryce\r\ngreeted me with his familiar kindliness. Though I did not see as much\r\nof this family as I would like (my business with the Interplanetary\r\nMails was wholly underpaid and miserably confining), yet I counted the\r\nGryces among my closest friends.\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce said, \"We are very glad to see you, Frank. Come outside.\r\nFrannie is preparing breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nHis manner was grave and quiet as always. But there was about him also\r\nan air of tenseness; and an aspect of apprehension. And it struck me,\r\na sort of weary, resigned depression which suddenly made his years sit\r\nmore heavily upon him. He was a man of some eighty odd; and though for\r\nhim no more than twenty or thirty years of life could be anticipated,\r\nI had never considered him really old. He was small, slight of frame,\r\nbut erect, sturdy and vigorous. A smooth-shaven face with no more lines\r\nupon it than a keen intellect and a character once wholly forceful\r\nwould engrave. And a mass of snow-white shaggy hair to make his head\r\nappear preternaturally large.\r\n\r\nHe seemed old now, however, with that sense of depression hanging upon\r\nhim. And an indefinable aspect of fear.\r\n\r\nI must allot a word to picture the three children of Dr. Gryce,\r\nmotherless since childhood. Brett was now twenty-eight--three years\r\nolder than myself, and physically my opposite. I am short, slender\r\nand rather dark. And--so they tell me--not too even of temper. Brett\r\nwas a blond young giant. Crisp, wavy blond hair, blue eyes and the\r\nstrong-featured, ruddy face of a handsome athlete. But not too\r\nhandsome, for there was upon him no consciousness of his essentially\r\nmasculine beauty. He was wonderfully good-natured. His was a ready,\r\nhearty laugh. He looked at life often from the humorous viewpoint. But\r\nhe had also a touch of his father's grave dignity; and a keen intellect\r\nand a soberness of thought and reason far beyond his years.\r\n\r\nThe two other children--Martynn and Francine--were twins, now just\r\nseventeen. Alike, physically and temperamentally, as children of a\r\nbirth traditionally should be. Slim and rather small--Martynn about my\r\nheight; Francine somewhat shorter. Both blue-eyed, with blond hair.\r\nFrancine's hair was long-waving tresses which she wore generally in\r\nplaits over her shoulders; Martynn's was short and curly. They were\r\nrather alike of feature; a delicacy of mold which gave to Martynn a\r\ngirlishness. But not an effeminacy, for he was a young daredevil; and\r\nhis sister hardly a lesser one. In childhood and adolescence an impish\r\nspirit of deviltry had always seemed to possess these twins; a spirit\r\nof mischief which had made them a great trial to their father. It had\r\nturned, now that they were nearing maturity, into an apparent desire\r\nfor reckless adventure--the product of abounding health, and bubbling,\r\nirrepressible good nature. They adored each other; were constantly\r\ntogether, with youthful escapades threatening limb and life and\r\ncomplete disaster, out of which they would emerge or be extricated with\r\ndauntless spirits unperturbed.\r\n\r\nThe greater maturity of womanhood at seventeen had brought to Frannie\r\nmoments of gentleness, sweetness and a simple dignity. But they were\r\nbrief moments, and no more than a word or look from her twin was needed\r\nto dispel them. Martt himself was without a vestige of dignity. But\r\nthey were no fools, these twins. They could, upon strict necessity,\r\ngive sober, intelligent thought to any problem at hand (Martynn had won\r\nhonors at the Great-London University); but of sober, matured action\r\nthey were incapable. Fearless--unreasonably fearless. But irresistible,\r\nlikable, and apparently quite capable of being restrained. A word\r\nfrom Dr. Gryce, or from Brett--and to a lesser extent from me who had\r\nknown them from childhood--brought instant though often very temporary\r\nobedience. They considered themselves quite grown up now. In truth, at\r\nseventeen, Frannie was to my eyes a really beautiful young woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nWe sat in a little arbor beside the house, with its breakfast table\r\nalready laid. Dr. Gryce, Brett, and myself. Martt was with Frannie\r\npreparing the meal. It was evidence of the simplicity which marked\r\nthe Gryce household. In these days of mechanical devices for almost\r\neverything--and the usual multiplicity of servants--there was not a\r\nmeal prepared for Dr. Gryce save by his daughter.\r\n\r\nI was very curious to learn why they had sent for me; but I had no need\r\nto question, for at once Dr. Gryce plunged into it.\r\n\r\n\"I hope, Frank, that you can stay--well, at least a few days with us.\r\nCan you?\"\r\n\r\nI stared. The Day Officer of the Manhattan Interplanetary Postal\r\nDivision was undoubtedly already in a rage at my absence. I said so.\r\n\"A few days? Dr. Gryce, I dread every conjunction that brings these\r\naccursed mails--my divisional officers think it's a crime even to eat\r\nor sleep when a planet is near us.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \"I imagine I can fix it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll stay, of course. If you could fix the planetary orbits so\r\nthat they were parabolas, Dr. Gryce, it would suit me exactly.\"\r\n\r\nHe and Brett both were smiling, but Dr. Gryce's smile was momentary,\r\nfor at once that indefinable air of trouble returned to him.\r\n\r\n\"Frank,\" he said, \"I hardly know how to begin telling you what we have\r\ndone--are about to do. It seems curious also--I know it will strike you\r\nso, you have been such a friend to me and my children--that during all\r\nthese years we have given you no hint of our purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have told no one,\" Brett put in: \"no one in the world.\"\r\n\r\nI said nothing, but my curiosity increased. It was doubtless of grave\r\nimport, this thing they had to tell me; the solemnity, earnestness\r\nwhich stamped them both was unmistakable.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Dr. Gryce was silent; then he said abruptly, \"You know,\r\nFrank, all my life I have been engaged with science. In a measure, I\r\nhave been successful; there are a few devices which will bear my name\r\nwhen I am gone.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded. \"I know that very well, Dr. Gryce.\"\r\n\r\n\"But all those things,\" he added earnestly, \"all that I stand for to\r\nthe world, has really been of little importance to me. My main labor,\r\ngoal, dream, if you will, I have never told anyone--not a living person\r\nexcept my children. For ten years past Brett has been helping me. And\r\nthough you would hardly believe it, for the last year or two Martt and\r\nFrannie have been of material aid in the accomplishment of my purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"What branch of science?\" I asked. \"And you've accomplished it? You're\r\nready to give it to the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Accomplished it--yes. But we are not ready to give it to the\r\nworld--perhaps we never shall. There would be evil in it--evil\r\ndiabolical--in untrained or unscrupulous hands. But we are ready to\r\ntest it--a practical test. Tonight, Frank, my boy Brett is going upon\r\nan adventure----\"\r\n\r\nThe fear which had been lurking in his eyes leaped to stamp his other\r\nfeatures. He was afraid for Brett--afraid of this thing they were going\r\nto do. He had stopped abruptly; and more quietly he added:\r\n\r\n\"I want you to understand me, Frank, and so for a moment we must\r\nbe wholly theoretical. This thing we are about to do involves the\r\nconstruction of our whole material universe. You know, of course, that\r\nno limit has been found to the divisibility of matter?\"\r\n\r\nHis sudden question confused me. \"You mean,\" I stammered, \"that things\r\ncan be infinitely small?\"\r\n\r\n\"That there is no limit to smallness,\" Brett put in. \"An atom--an\r\nelectron--they are mere words. Within them conceivably might be a\r\nspace with stars, planets, suns--worlds of their own so tiny that\r\ncompared to the Space in which they roam that Space would seem--and\r\nwould be--illimitable. Picture that, Frank. And picture upon one of\r\nthose worlds inhabitants of proportionate smallness. What would they\r\nsee, feel or think of the universe? Would they not conceive it about as\r\nwe do? Picture them with powerful microscopes, looking downward into\r\nthe matter composing their world. They would be aware of molecules,\r\natoms--they would gaze down into Space unending. Another realm within\r\ntheir own. And within that one--others and yet others to infinity. The\r\nconception confuses you, Frank? It need not. Each of those realms is\r\ntiny--or large--according to the viewpoint. There can be no such thing\r\nas absolute size.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I mean,\" Dr. Gryce interrupted eagerly. \"Absolute\r\nsize--how can you conceive it? You can not. A thing is large or small\r\nonly in relation to something else smaller or larger.\"\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand to the rolling landscape with the morning light and\r\nshadow upon it, visible through the arbor.\r\n\r\n\"There is our everyday world, Frank. How big is it? You can not say.\r\nMillimeters, meters, kilometers, helans, light-years--those are only\r\nwords with which we designate a comparison. Compared to what our\r\nmicroscopes show us, this world of ours is very large, but compared to\r\nthe spaces between the stars--the stars themselves--it is very small.\r\nTry then to imagine its absolute size. You can not, because there is\r\nno such thing. A universe within what we call an atom--another realm\r\nwithin an atom of matter upon one of the worlds of _that_ universe--is\r\nnot an extraordinary state of smallness _until we compare it with\r\nourselves_.\r\n\r\n\"And this world of ours. It is normal to us; of no absolute size\r\nwhatever--neither large nor small--until we compare it to something\r\nelse. But suppose we visualize larger realms? Suppose we say these\r\nplanets, stars--all the starry universe within our ken and this visual\r\nspace which contains them--suppose we imagine all that to be contained\r\nwithin the atom of a particle of matter of some comparatively still\r\nlarger realm? At once our world and ourselves shrink into smallness.\r\nWhere a moment ago we had seemed large, now we seem small. Yet that\r\nother gigantic world within which we are contained--if we could live in\r\nit our telescopes would show us still larger Space unending. We would\r\nfeel tiny--and of actuality _we would be tiny_--contemplating Space and\r\nsize so much larger.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there you have infinity of Space,\" Brett added, as his father\r\npaused. \"Unending Space both smaller and larger than ourselves.\r\nWe--everything of which we can be physically aware--represent no more\r\nthan a single step in the ladder which has no bottom nor no top. You\r\ncan not conceive an end in either direction. There is no such thing.\r\nNor--as Father says--can you declare anything to be small or large\r\nconsidered by itself alone. This then is Space as we conceive it to be.\r\nIllimitable, unending--infinite Space.\"\r\n\r\nThe conception momentarily seemed wholly beyond my grasp. What I would\r\nhave answered when for a moment Dr. Gryce and Brett paused I do not\r\nknow, for from the house the approaching voices of Martt and Frannie\r\nreached us.\r\n\r\n\"You'll fall, I tell you! Frannie, give me that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll trip over the wires and you'll fall and smash it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't.\"\r\n\r\nThe sound of a crash. And Martt's voice, \"There, I told you!\"\r\n\r\nThey were upon us, wheeling the tray laden with breakfast; Martt,\r\nflushed, laughing. \"Oh, hello, Frank--they didn't switch you wrong, did\r\nthey? Frannie broke the heater coils--if the breakfast gets cold, don't\r\nblame me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Frannie, also flushed and laughing and a trifle rueful over the\r\nmishap. Dressed in a blue blouse and widely flaring, knee-length\r\ntrousers, with her golden hair tossing on her shoulders. The picture of\r\na little housewife, of early morning informality. I thought I had never\r\nseen her so beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n\"That, Frank, is our conception of the infinity of Space.\"\r\n\r\nWith breakfast finished Brett had resumed the discussion. We were\r\nall seated in the arbor. Martt and Frannie momentarily were quiet,\r\nseemingly keenly interested in the impression upon me which they\r\nanticipated would come from their father's disclosures.\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce said, \"The idea of Time unending is indissolubly bound with\r\nthe concept of infinite Space. You will realize, Frank, for some\r\ncenturies it has been understood that Time and Space are inextricably\r\nblended. We think instinctively of Space as a tangible entity--of\r\nlength, breadth and thickness. And of Time, as intangible. Such really\r\nis not the case. Space has three dimensions--but Time also has a\r\ndimension.\"\r\n\r\n\"Length,\" Martt put in. \"It sounds like a play on words, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't,\" Frannie finished for him. \"I can't imagine anything clearer\r\nthan that Time has length.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce ignored them. \"You must understand also that Time as we\r\nconceive it can not exist except as the measurement of a _length_\r\nbetween two events. And what is an event? It presupposes the existence\r\nof _Matter_, does it not? Matter thus is introduced into the universe.\r\nIt also can not be independent of Time and Space. So long as anything\r\nmaterial exists, there must be Space for it to exist in; and Time to\r\nmark the passing of its existence.\r\n\r\n\"Of our universe, then, we now have Matter, Time and Space. There is a\r\nfourth--shall I say, element? It also is interdependent with each of\r\nthe other three. It is _Motion_. You know, of course, that there can be\r\nno such thing as absolute Motion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or absolute Time,\" Frannie put in.\r\n\r\n\"That we will discuss later,\" Dr. Gryce said quickly, \"since it is\r\nmore intricate of conception. Absolute Motion is impossible and\r\nnon-existent. We can say a thing moves fast or slowly, _only in\r\nrelation to the movement of something else_. One word more. I want you\r\nto realize, Frank, how wholly dependent each of these factors is upon\r\nthe other. _Matter_, for instance, is an entity persisting in Space\r\nand Time. _Motion_ is the simultaneous change of the position of Matter\r\nin Space and Time. A thing was _here, then_; it is _there, now_. That\r\nis Motion. You see how you can not deal with one without involving the\r\nothers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Say, Father, why don't you tell him what we're going to do?\" Martt\r\ndemanded. \"Frank, listen--tonight Brett and I----\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm going, too,\" Frannie declared.\r\n\r\n\"You're not!\"\r\n\r\nI saw again that look of fear in old Dr. Gryce's eyes. His\r\nchildren--the spirit of youth with its lust for adventure--they were\r\neager and excited. But Dr. Gryce saw beyond that--saw the danger. . .\r\n\r\nHe said gravely, \"There is no possibility of my making you understand\r\nthe details, Frank, until we have gone into the matter thoroughly.\r\nBut as Martt implies, you are no doubt impatient. I will tell you\r\nthen, briefly, that for most of my life I have been delving into\r\nthis subject--Matter, Space, Time and Motion illimitable. Longing to\r\ninvestigate this immense material universe which I believe exists. But\r\nwe humans are fettered, Frank. Like an ant, living for a brief moment\r\nenchained with a cobweb to a twig and trying to envisage the earth.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice now was trembling with emotion. \"I was satisfied to see with\r\nmy own eyes some little part into infinity. I invented what we--my\r\nchildren and I--call the myrdoscope. I will explain it presently.\r\nSuffice it now to say that there are normally invisible rays, akin\r\nto light, crossing Space, and I have made them visible. We captured\r\nthem--saw after a myriad trials unavailing, occasional vague glimpses\r\nof the beyond which came to us. It might have satisfied me, but three\r\nyears ago, one night, Brett saw----\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, looking at Brett. Martt and Frannie were breathless, with\r\neyes fixed on me.\r\n\r\nBrett said, and his voice had a queer, solemn hush to it, \"I was\r\nlooking through the myrdoscope. We had seen blurred, brief glimpses of\r\na realm----\"\r\n\r\n\"Beyond the stars,\" Frannie breathed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, beyond the stars. A realm seemingly of forest, or\r\nsomething growing. Silvery patches--you might imagine they were\r\nwater, or light shining upon something that glistened. They\r\nwere always haphazard, these glimpses. We caught them, not\r\nalways from one direction--seemingly from everywhere. A realm\r\nencompassing--enclosing--our whole star-filled Space.\r\n\r\n\"With the labor of years, which you, Frank, will appreciate to some\r\ndegree, Father has charted what for our own little ken we might call\r\nabsolute points in Space. Landmarks, say, of this outer realm. With our\r\nwhirling earth, the ever-changing planets and stars, only this outer\r\nrealm seemed of fixed position. We could sometimes return our gaze to\r\nthe same landmark--a tremendous crescent-shaped patch of silver, for\r\ninstance, which several times we succeeded in re-finding.\r\n\r\n\"It was near this patch at which I was one night gazing, when through\r\nsome vagary of the ray bearing its image--or some difference in our\r\ncrude apparatus--the scene suddenly clarified. And magnified as though\r\nat once I had leaped a million light-years toward it.\r\n\r\n\"I saw then a magnified section of the larger scene. The patch of\r\nsilver appeared now as a shimmering, opalescent liquid. A segment of\r\nshore-front; and this all in a moment, again magnified. Upon a bluish\r\nbank of soft vegetation, with the opal liquid beside it, I saw a girl\r\nhalf reclining. A girl of human form, but transfigured by a beauty\r\nmore than human. A girl of a civilization behind our own--or perhaps\r\none in advance--I do not know. She was robed in a short, simple garment\r\nmore like a glistening, glowing silver veil than a dress. Her hair was\r\nlong--a tangled dark mass. She reclined there in an attitude of ease\r\nand the abandonment of maidenly solitude. I say that she was more than\r\nbeautiful--oh, Frank----\"\r\n\r\nBrett's voice had suddenly lost the precise exactitude of the\r\nscientist. He seemed to have forgotten his father--Martt and Frannie;\r\nit was as though he were confiding his human emotions only to me.\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful, Frank. A strange, wild beauty, with a curious ethereal\r\naspect to it. I don't know--it's indescribable. Human--half human, but\r\nhalf divine.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe checked himself; the scientist in him again became uppermost; but\r\nthough he now spoke with careful phrasing, his face remained flushed.\r\n\r\n\"It was some moments before I saw additional details. And then I\r\nrealized that the girl was not alone. Upon her bare feet were a sort of\r\nsandal with thongs crossing the ankle. And standing there beside one of\r\nher feet were two tiny human figures. In height, the length perhaps of\r\nher little foot. Men of human form; yet queerly grotesque; misshapen.\r\nOne of them was in the act of reaching upward toward the tassel of her\r\nsandal cord where it dangled from her ankle; reaching as though to\r\ngrasp it and draw himself upward. The other was watching; and both were\r\ngrinning with gnomelike malevolence.\r\n\r\n\"Nor was this all, for behind the girl, a brief distance away in what\r\nappeared a woodland dell, was another figure--a man of aspect akin to\r\nthe grinning gnomes, save that in comparative size even to the girl\r\nhe was gigantic. Ten times her height, perhaps, he stood behind her\r\ntowering into the trees about him. A man of short, squat legs, dark\r\nwith matted hair; a garment like the gnomes', which might have been an\r\nanimal skin; a heavy massive chest; black hair long to his neck. A face\r\nwith clipped hair upon it. He was regarding the girl; a grin, but with\r\na leer to it--horribly sinister. And in his great hands, brandished\r\nlike a bludgeon, was an uprooted tree.\r\n\r\n\"Have I given you an idea of motion in the scene? There was none.\r\nThe girl was obviously wholly unaware that she was not alone. She\r\nlay motionless. But the lack of movement in her--in them all--was\r\nmore marked than that. The girl's lips were parted in a half-smile of\r\nrevery; but the outlines of her bosom beneath the silver veil did not\r\nmove. There was no movement of breath; no change of expression. The\r\ngnomes, the giant--not the minutest change could I see mirrored in\r\ntheir faces.\r\n\r\n\"Yet it was so lifelike, I could not doubt it was life--and that the\r\nmotion was there though I could not see it. I watched all night,\r\nshaken with this fragment of drama, perhaps tragedy, which I was\r\nwitnessing--but even the girl's eyelids did not tremble. Dawn came; the\r\nscene faded.\r\n\r\n\"For a month I did not even tell Father; and Frank, the vision of that\r\ngirl has never left me. The menace--gruesome, sinister--upon her--and\r\nher beauty----\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you ever seen her again?\" I asked eagerly. \"Was it life? How\r\ncould it be life without motion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he saw her again,\" Martt exclaimed. \"I've seen her--we've all seen\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him, Brett,\" Frannie urged.\r\n\r\n\"A month before I even told Father. During it, I searched for the scene\r\nunavailing, then Father and I searched together. It was a year, when\r\nalmost from the same orbital position we came upon the scene again.\r\nA year--and now we saw a change. The figures all were there, frozen\r\ninto immobility as before. But the gnome had caught the tassel, had\r\ndrawn himself partly up to stand upon the girl's white ankle. The giant\r\nhad come a trifle forward, and the upraised tree in his hands was\r\npartly lowered. The girl's attitude was unchanged, but there was now\r\nupon her face the vague dawn of startled knowledge, as though at that\r\ninstant she was becoming aware of something pulling at her sandal cord,\r\nsomething touching her ankle--perhaps too, she was hearing a sound from\r\nthe giant behind her. The startled knowledge which as yet had not had\r\ntime fully to register upon her face.\"\r\n\r\nMy mind was whirling with a confusion of thoughts; the vague\r\ncomprehension of what Brett meant was coming to me. I stammered, \"Not\r\nyet had time--but Brett, you must have watched them all that night----\"\r\n\r\n\"That night, Frank. And others--but there was no sign of movement.\r\nAnother year--that was last year--we saw the girl partly aware of\r\nher danger. This year--a month ago--she was fully aware of it.\r\nFrightened--her eyes stricken wide with terror. But she had had no time\r\nas yet to move.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you understand, Frank? That drama is going on out there now.\r\nLike size of Matter and Space--and rate of Motion--there is no absolute\r\nTime. It is all comparative. To that realm out there of which we have\r\nbeen given a little vision, our tiny worlds here in the heavens are\r\nmere whirling electrons, like the electrons within one of our own atoms\r\nwhich to our consciousness of Time revolve many times a second.\r\n\r\n\"A year! A single revolution of our earth about its sun! To that girl\r\nout there, what we call a year is merely an electron in a fraction of\r\na second revolving about its fellow. Even that is very slow--for she\r\nherself is wholly within the atom of a greater world outside her. A\r\nyear as we call it--a second or less, to her. And though she is in full\r\nmovement, how can we hope to see it by watching for a night? If a year\r\nwere a second to her--an eight-hour vigil of ours would encompass less\r\nthan a thousandth part of a second of her life!\r\n\r\n\"All comparative, Frank. There is nothing wonderful or really strange\r\nabout it. In what we would experience to be a hundred years from now\r\nthat girl will be fully faced with the menace of her assailants. A\r\nmoment only, to her consciousness. It is that, Frank, we meant by the\r\ninfinity of Time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him what we're going to do,\" Martt insisted breathlessly.\r\n\r\nIt came from Brett in a burst almost incoherent. \"I was not satisfied\r\nmerely to see into this comparative infinity. Nor was Father. We have\r\nworked three feverish years, Frank, to climax all the labor of Father's\r\nwhich had gone before. And we have found a way--not merely to see,\r\nbut to transport ourselves into these greater realms. A vehicle--I'll\r\nshow you--explain it all. Its size can be changed--the state of the\r\nmatter composing it is within our control. Its position in Space can be\r\nchanged--simple enough, Frank, to enlarge upon the principles of our\r\ninterplanetary vehicles. And--with one factor so interdependent upon\r\nthe other--we have been able to control the rate of its Time-progress.\r\nIt travels through Time as it does through Space.\"\r\n\r\nHis words were tumbling over each other. \"You'll see it in a moment,\r\nFrank--test it--we have it here, ready yesterday. It sets us free,\r\ndon't you understand? Free at last in Space and Time. And I'm going in\r\nit tonight--with Martt perhaps--we're going out to reach that girl upon\r\nan equality of Size and Time-progress. Going out to explore infinity!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 2_\r\n\r\n                   \"THIS COULD DESTROY THE UNIVERSE\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI had anticipated that they would show me a vehicle similar perhaps\r\nto the huge and elaborate space-flyers in the service of our\r\nInterplanetary Postal Division. But instead of taking me to the\r\nworkshops where I had conceived it to be lying--serene, glistening\r\nwith newness, intricate with what devices for its changing of size and\r\nTime-rate I could not imagine--instead of this they took me into the\r\nhouse. And there, in Dr. Gryce's quiet study with its sober, luxurious\r\nfurnishings and his library of cylinders ranged in orderly array about\r\nthe walls, I saw not one but four machines--mere models standing there\r\non the polished table-top. Four of them identical--all of a milk-white\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nBut they were models complete in every detail. I stood beside one,\r\nregarding it with a breathless, absorbed interest as Dr. Gryce\r\ncommented upon it. A cube of about the length of my forearm in its\r\nthree equal dimensions, with a cone-shaped tower on top--a little\r\ntower not much longer than my longest finger. The cube itself had a\r\nrectangular doorway, and in each face two banks of windows. The door\r\nslid sidewise, the windows were of a transparent material, like glass.\r\nMidway about the cube ran a tiny balcony at the second-story level. It\r\nwas wholly enclosed by the glasslike material. It extended around all\r\nfour sides; small doors from it gave access to the cube's interior. The\r\ncone on top also had windows, and its entire apex was transparent.\r\n\r\nI bent down and peered into the lower doorway. Tiny rooms were there.\r\nBedrooms; a cookery--a house complete, save that it was wholly\r\nunfurnished. The largest room on the lower story--its floor had a\r\ncircular transparent pane in it--was fitted with a seemingly intricate\r\narray of tiny mechanisms all of the same milk-white metal. A metallic\r\ntable held most of them; and I could see wires fine as cobwebs\r\nconnecting them. And in a corner of this room, a metallic spiral\r\nstairway leading to the upper story.\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce said, \"That is the instrument room, complete. It contains\r\nevery mechanism for the operation of the vehicle. We made it in\r\nthis size--large enough to facilitate construction, but it is small\r\nenough to be economical of material. This substance--we have never\r\nnamed it--is of our own isolation. It is expensive. I'll explain it\r\npresently. . . . That room beside the instrument room is where we will\r\nput the usual everyday instruments necessary to the journey. Oxygen\r\ntanks--the apparatus for air purification and air renewal; telescopes,\r\nmicroscopes--my myrdoscope--all that sort of thing we can best obtain\r\nin its normal size. Those--and the furnishings--the provisions--all\r\nthose in their normal size we will put into it later.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean,\" I asked, \"this is not a model? This is the actual vehicle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he smiled.\r\n\r\n\"But there are four of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"We made six, Frank. It was advisable, and not unduly difficult to\r\nduplicate the parts in the making. The assembling took time----\"\r\n\r\nBrett said, \"Father was insistent that we make every advance test\r\npossible. We have already used two of them. We are going to test the\r\nothers today.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" exclaimed Frannie. \"Do it now--Frank will want to see it.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce lifted one of the vehicles. In his hand it seemed light as\r\nalemite. He placed it on a taboret and we sat grouped around it.\r\n\r\n\"I shall send it into Time,\" he said quietly, \"with its size unchanged,\r\nwith no motion in Space, so that always in relation to us it will\r\nremain right here--I am going to send it back into other ages of Time.\"\r\nHe turned to me earnestly. \"We wanted you here, Frank, because you are\r\nso good a friend to me and my children. But for a selfish reason as\r\nwell. When Brett goes out into Space and Time tonight, I want your keen\r\neye to follow him. Your ability to record so accurately on the clocks\r\nwhat you see at any given instant----\"\r\n\r\nHe was referring to my experience at the Table Mountain observatory--my\r\nfirst work when my training period was over. I had, indeed, a curiously\r\nkeen vision for astronomical observation, and a quickness of finger\r\nupon the clock to record what I saw. In transit work I was extremely\r\naccurate; even now they were asking the Postal Division for my services\r\nat Table Mountain in the forthcoming transit of Venus.\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce was saying, \"Your accuracy is phenomenal, Frank--your figures\r\nas you observe what little we see of this flight will help me--set my\r\nmind at rest that Brett is making no errors.\" He ended with a smile,\r\n\"So you realize we have a selfish motive in wanting you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very glad,\" I responded. He nodded and went back at once to what\r\nhe had been saying previously. \"I'm going to send this into Time. You\r\nmust understand, Frank, that I can give you now only the fundamental\r\nconcepts underlying this apparatus. We have so much to do today--so\r\nlittle time for theory. I need only tell you that it is readily\r\ndemonstrable that Time is one of the inherent factors governing the\r\n_state of Matter_. This substance we have discovered--created, if you\r\nwill--yields readily to a change of state. An electronic charge--a\r\ncurrent akin to, but not identical with electricity--changes the\r\nstate of this substance in several ways. A rapid duplication of the\r\nfundamental entities within its electrons--they are, as you perhaps\r\nknow, mere _whirlpools of nothingness_--this rapid duplication adds\r\nsize. The substance--with shape unaltered--grows larger. With such a\r\nsize-change there comes a normal, correspondingly progressive change of\r\nTime-rate. We had to go beyond that, however, and secure an independent\r\nTime-rate, independently changeable, so that the vehicle might remain\r\nquiescent in size and still change its Time. In doing that, the _state\r\nof the matter_ as our senses perceive it is completely altered. As\r\nyou know, no two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time.\r\nWhich only means that with the Time-dimensions identical, different\r\ndimensions of Space are needed. With the Time-dimension differing--the\r\nstate of Matter is different; two bodies thus can be together in the\r\nsame space.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is a Time-dimension?\" I asked. \"I mean--how can you alter it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would say, Frank, that the Time-dimension of a material body is the\r\n_length_--or a measure of the length--of its fundamental vibration.\r\nBasically there is no real substance as we conceive it--for all\r\nMatter is mere vibration. Let us delve into substance. We find Matter\r\nconsists of molecules vibrating in Space. Molecules are composed of\r\natoms vibrating in Space. Within the atoms are electrons, revolving\r\nin Space. The electrons are without substance, merely vibrations\r\nelectrically negative in character. The nucleus--once termed proton--is\r\nall then that we have left of substance. What is it? A mere vortex--an\r\nelectrical vortex of nothingness!\r\n\r\n\"You see, Frank, there is no real substance existing. It is all\r\nvibration. Motion, in other words. Of what? That we do not know. Call\r\nit a motion of disembodied electrical energy. Perhaps it is something\r\nakin to that. But from it, our substantial, tangible, material universe\r\nis built. All dependent upon its vibratory rate. And the measure of\r\nthat I would call the Time-dimension. When we alter that--when through\r\nthe impulse of a current of vibration we attack that fundamental vortex\r\nto make it whirl at greater or lesser rate--then we, in effect, have\r\nchanged the Time-dimension.\"\r\n\r\nThere was so much that seemed dimly close to my understanding, and yet\r\neluded me!\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I said, \"if you send that little cube back into Time, it will\r\nno longer exist at all. It will be in the past--non-existent now. Or\r\nsuppose you send it into the future? It _will exist_ sometime--but now,\r\nit will be non-existent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's where you're wrong,\" Brett exclaimed. \"Don't you realize\r\nthat you're making Time absolute? You're taking yourself and this\r\npresent instant as fixed points of Space and Time--the standards\r\nbeyond which nothing else can exist. That's fatuous. Frank, look\r\nhere, it's simple enough once you grasp it. Time and Space are quite\r\nsimilar, except that you have never moved about in Time but you have\r\nin Space. Suppose you had not. Suppose--with your present power of\r\nthought--you were this house. You had always been here--always would be\r\nhere. Suppose, too, that the world--the land and water--moved slowly\r\npast you, at an unalterable rate. That's what Time does to us. Then\r\nsuppose I were to say to you--you as the house--'Let us go now to\r\nGreat-London.' That would puzzle you. You would say, 'Great-London was\r\nhere a year ago. But now it is gone--non-existent. It did exist--but\r\nnow it doesn't.' Or you would say, 'The shore of the Great-Pacific\r\nOcean will be here next year.' If I said, 'I'm going there now,' you\r\nwould reply, 'But you'll be in the future. You'll be non-existent!'\r\nMaking yourself the standard of everything. Don't you see how fatuous\r\nthat is?\"\r\n\r\nI did not answer. It was so strange a mode of thought; it made me feel\r\nso insignificant, so enslaved by the fetters of my human senses. And\r\nthese fetters Brett was very soon to cast off.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nMartt said, \"Can't we make the tests, Father? There is a frightful lot\r\nto do and it's nearly mid-morning already.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the table Dr. Gryce took a small rod of the milk-white metal--a\r\nrod half a meter long and the diameter of my smallest finger. He knelt\r\non the floor beside the taboret, peering into the tiny doorway of the\r\nmechanism he was about to send winging into the distant ages of our\r\nPast. Again we were breathless.\r\n\r\n\"More light, Frannie,\" he said. \"I can not see inside here.\" Frannie\r\nillumined the tubes along the ceiling; the room was flooded with their\r\nsoft, blue-white light.\r\n\r\n\"That's better.\" Rod in hand he turned momentarily to me. \"I'm going\r\nto throw the Time-switch by pressing it with this rod,\" he explained.\r\n\"Within the vehicle--the confined space there--the current is equally\r\nfelt.\" He smiled gravely. \"Without the rod I should lose a finger to\r\nthe Past----\"\r\n\r\nCarefully he inserted the rod into the doorway. A moment of fumbling,\r\nthen I heard a click. The little milk-white model seemed to tremble. It\r\nglowed; from it there came a soft, infinitely small humming sound. It\r\nglowed, melted into translucency--transparency. For an instant I had\r\na vague sense that a spectral wraith of it was still before me. Then\r\nwith a blink of my eyelids I realized that it was gone. The taboret was\r\nempty. Beside it, Dr. Gryce knelt with the rod melted off midway of its\r\nlength in his hand.\r\n\r\nI breathed again. Brett said softly, \"It is gone, Frank. Gone into the\r\nPast, relative to our consciousness of Time. Gone from our senses--yet\r\nit is here--occupying the same Space it did before--but with a\r\ndifferent Time.\"\r\n\r\nHe passed his hand through the apparent vacancy above the taboret.\r\nTo me then came a realization of how crowded all Space must be! Of\r\nwhat a tiny fraction of things existent--of events occurring--are we\r\nconscious! That Space over the taboret--empty to me. . . . yet it held\r\nfor a mind omniscient an infinity of things strewn through the ages of\r\nthe Past and Future. What multiplicity of events--unseen by me--Time\r\nwas holding separate in that crowded Space above the taboret!\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce was saying, \"Let us test one now by sending it into\r\nsmallness--come here, Frank.\"\r\n\r\nHe had risen to stand by the table, with another of the models before\r\nhim. \"This bit of stone,\" he said. \"Let us send it into that.\"\r\n\r\nHe laid a flat piece of black-gray, smoothly polished stone on the\r\ntable near the model. And with another rod he reached into the doorway.\r\nAgain I heard a click. He withdrew the rod. \"You see, Frank.\"\r\n\r\nI saw that the rod was slightly compressed along the length he\r\nhad inserted. The model was already dwindling. Soundlessly,\r\nuntremblingly--it was contracting, becoming smaller, with shape and\r\naspect otherwise unchanged. Soon it was the size of my fist. Dr. Gryce\r\npicked it up, rested it upon his opened hand. But in a moment it was no\r\nmore than a tiny cube rocking in the movement of his palm. He gripped\r\nit gingerly with thumb and forefinger and set it on the polished black\r\nslab of stone. Its milk-white color there showed it clearly. But it\r\nwas very small--smaller than the thumb-nail of my little finger. The\r\ncone-shaped tower was a needle-point.\r\n\r\nA breathless moment passed. It was now no more than a white speck upon\r\nthe black stone surface.\r\n\r\nBrett said, \"Try the microscope, Frank. You watch it.\"\r\n\r\nI put the low-powered instrument over it; Brett adjusted the light. The\r\nstone was smoothly polished. But now, under the glass, upon a shaggy\r\nmass of uneven rock surface I saw the vehicle visually as large as it\r\nhad been originally. But it was dwindling progressively faster. Soon\r\nit lay tilted sidewise upon a slope of the rock; smaller--a tiny speck\r\nclinging there.\r\n\r\n\"Can you still see it?\" Brett murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--no--now it is gone.\" The rock seemed empty. Somewhere down\r\nin there the little mechanism lay dwindling. Forever it would grow\r\nsmaller. Dwindling into an infinity of smallness; but always to be with\r\nthings of its size--and things yet smaller. . . .\r\n\r\nAs I turned from the glass, I became aware that Martt and Frannie were\r\nnot in the room. Dr. Gryce and Brett, absorbed in the test, quite\r\nevidently had not noticed them leave. There had been two other models\r\non the table--there was now but one.\r\n\r\nThen from the garden outside the house a cry reached us. A shout--a cry\r\nof fear--terror. Martt's voice.\r\n\r\n\"Father! Brett! Help us! Help! Quick!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe rushed from the room.\r\n\r\nCrowning wonder, yet horrible! A surge of fear swept me. In the garden\r\nquite near the house stood the other model. Small no longer. It had\r\ngrown--_was growing_--until already it was as large as the house\r\nitself. Around it the flowers, shrubs, even a tree had been pushed\r\nand trampled by its expanding bulk. It stood gleaming white in the\r\nsunlight, motionless save for that steady, increasingly rapid growth.\r\nIts windows and doors loomed large dark rectangles; its balcony was\r\nbroad as a corridor; its cone tower was already reared higher than the\r\nnearest trees.\r\n\r\n\"Father! Help!\"\r\n\r\nAt the doorway of the vehicle, standing just outside it, were the\r\nterror-stricken Martt and Frannie. They were holding the end of a long\r\nmetallic pole which projected into the doorway. Struggling with its\r\nweight, striving to throw the switch inside.\r\n\r\nWe reached them. The expanding bulk of the gleaming side of the\r\nvehicle had pushed them back into a thicket of shrubbery. Near them a\r\ntree, uprooted as though it were a straw sticking upright in sand, was\r\npushed aside and fell with a crash.\r\n\r\nMartt and Frannie were livid with terror; breathless, almost exhausted\r\nwith their futile efforts.\r\n\r\nMartt panted, \"We can't--lift the pole! It's--too heavy--too large\r\ninside.\"\r\n\r\nWithin the huge doorway, by the sunlight streaming through the windows,\r\nI could see the interior half of the pole, bloated by growth, huge,\r\nheavy.\r\n\r\nBrett shoved Frannie away. \"Frank! Here--take hold with us.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce was with us. Together we four men got the interior end of the\r\npole upon the table inside. A tremendous switch lever was there. But\r\nthe pole slipped, rolled down. I expected it to break at the doorway\r\npoint where it was so small outside, but it did not. The expanding\r\ndoorway had pushed us farther back. Another tree on the other side\r\nfell. Above us the vehicle's tower loomed like a cathedral spire.\r\nTremendous now, the vehicle had grown until it was almost touching the\r\nhouse. A fence had been trampled, had vanished beneath its giant bulk.\r\n\r\nAnd the growth was increasingly rapid. If we could not check it . . .\r\nIf it got wholly beyond control--this monster, growing . . . forever\r\ngrowing, to a size infinitely large--larger than our earth itself. . . .\r\n\r\nI must have been standing stupidly confused. I heard Dr. Gryce\r\nimploring, \"Take hold of it, Frank! We must lift it. We must--our last\r\nchance----\"\r\n\r\nBut Brett pushed us away. \"I'm going inside. I can move the switch--let\r\ngo of me, Father! That switch--it isn't too big yet--but it will be in\r\na minute. Let go of me!\"\r\n\r\n\"No! No, Brett! The shock as you went in--you couldn't take it so\r\nsuddenly. It might hurt you--kill you. And the switch is too big for\r\nyour strength.\"\r\n\r\nIt was out of control--this monster, growing, inexorably growing--it\r\nwas pushing at the house--a great white giant pushing gently but with\r\nan irresistible power at the little toy house beside it. I could see\r\nthe house shifting on its foundations; a corner of it tilted downward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The vehicle was out of control, pushing at the house\r\nlike a great white giant.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Brett! Father! Try it now. One last try.\" Martt and Frannie had the\r\npole again in position. With a last despairing effort we raised it;\r\nslid it up over the giant table-edge; caught the wide flaring side of\r\nthe giant switch. Pushing--despairingly; five of us, pigmies struggling\r\nthere at that giant threshold. The switch moved. Our pole held its\r\nplace; the switch moved farther, clicked with a tremendous snap that\r\nreverberated about us. The growth of the monster was checked. It stood\r\nthere serene, triumphant, with the little house, tilted, but still\r\nstanding bravely beside it.\r\n\r\nWhite, shaken, we ceased our efforts. Frannie gasped, \"We--we only\r\nwanted to make it a normal size--so you could load it up with the\r\nfurniture and things. But it--it got away from us.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce said, \"It is a lesson--perhaps a lesson which we needed\r\nforced upon us.\" He gestured to the great quiescent white building\r\nwhich had spread itself over most of the devastated garden. \"A lesson,\"\r\nhe repeated. \"We must guard this power carefully. In unskilled\r\nor unscrupulous hands it is a power for evil almost unthinkable.\r\nThis monster here--if it had gotten beyond us--if we had lost its\r\ncontrol--this could destroy the Universe!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 3_\r\n\r\n                        EXPLORERS INTO INFINITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You think we've got everything in it?\" Frannie asked anxiously.\r\n\r\nWe had gotten the vehicle back to a size normal to our own stature;\r\nand all day had been working to equip it. The instrument room--its\r\nSpace and Time and size mechanisms were complete. I had learned now\r\nthat it was to be transported through Space by very similar principles\r\nto those commonly in use--a controlled attraction or repulsion\r\nof the faces of its cube for the heavenly body nearest to it; in\r\neffect, an intensification--a neutralization--or reversal at will of\r\nthe electronic force which flows between and mutually attracts all\r\nmaterial bodies; the force which once--in centuries past--was called\r\ngravitation. It needed no word of explanation. Its velocity and\r\ndistance dials, its direction indicators, were familiar, though rather\r\nmore intricate than those I had seen in the Interplanetary Service.\r\nBeyond that, there was a bank of dials upon which a changing size was\r\nrecorded--with the vehicle's present starting dimensions to be the\r\nstandard unit. And other dials for its Time-change. Of these there were\r\ntwo distinct sets. One, a record of the normal Time-change, inevitable\r\nto a change of size; another, a comparison of that Time-distance with\r\nthe normal Time-progress of the earth, so that the Time-position of the\r\nvehicle into the earth's Past or Future could be seen.\r\n\r\nIn a subsidiary instrument-room was a variety of modern astronomical\r\napparatus; the myrdoscope, and a receiver for an aural ray which, as\r\na guide to Brett, Dr. Gryce was to send from earth. Of this, in more\r\ndetail, they later explained.\r\n\r\nIn a smaller room were the apparatus for air renewal, the making of\r\nvarious necessary gases, water and synthetic foods; a store-room\r\nof provisions; rooms furnished comfortably so that the vehicle was\r\ncomplete in its living quarters. A thousand details, until at the last\r\nI felt as Frannie did--wondering how we could have failed to overlook a\r\nscore of things we had intended to do.\r\n\r\nIt was nightfall when we finished; and all that evening we spent\r\nchecking up the equipment. Dr. Gryce's home had not been seriously\r\ndamaged by the morning's mishap; and as midnight approached we gathered\r\nin the little observation and instrument room he had built in its upper\r\nstory. Brett and Martt, it had been decided, were to make the journey;\r\nwe others were to watch and wait. It seemed the more difficult role.\r\nAll that evening Dr. Gryce had been increasingly silent, careworn\r\nof manner and aspect. And though Brett was excited in his mature,\r\nrepressed fashion--and Martt frankly exuberant--I saw that little\r\nFrannie was solemn, perturbed as her father.\r\n\r\nIt was a soft, brilliant, cloudless night, with no moon to pale the\r\ngleaming stars. And at last every detail was settled, and the midnight\r\nhour we had set for departure was at hand. We went forth with them to\r\nthe waiting vehicle. There was nothing more to say. They stood--Brett\r\nand Martt--in the opened doorway as we gathered about them.\r\n\r\n\"Well--good-bye, Father--good-bye, Frannie dear.\" Brett held her close;\r\nthen released her, pushed her away. \"Good-bye, Frank.\" His hand-clasp\r\nwas warm and steady.\r\n\r\nMartt was jocular, but now at the last I could hear a tremble to his\r\nvoice. \"When we get to that girl out there--well, I'm going to tell her\r\nhow interested you all are in her.\" His laugh was high-pitched. \"That\r\nis, if we can handle that giant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Brett. Good-bye, Martt.\"\r\n\r\nOur words were so futile, so inadequate to the surge of feeling within\r\nus! The door slid closed upon them. The vehicle, not to change size\r\nuntil it was far into the realms of outer interstellar Space, beyond\r\nour crowding little planets--lifted gently, soared upward, slid away\r\nfrom us, a glistening white shape up there in the quiet starlight.\r\n\r\nGravely, silently, with what sinking of heart I could only imagine, Dr.\r\nGryce stood regarding it. Beside me Frannie was crying softly.\r\n\r\nExplorers into infinity! And they were gone, to encounter--what?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 4_\r\n\r\n                             THE WATCHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe spent the rest of that night in the little observation room on the\r\nupper story of Dr. Gryce's home; with him and Frannie beside me I sat\r\nwatching the vehicle's flight through the electro-telescope. It was\r\nnot a high-powered instrument, but it served. I could see the vehicle\r\nplainly as it passed through our atmosphere and out into Space. A tiny\r\nblob with darker rectangles of windows.\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce sat with instruments, charts and his computations before\r\nhim. Occasionally he would ask me for the vehicle's position; and I\r\nwould give him the points and clock the time with all the accuracy\r\nof which I was capable. He seemed solemn, perturbed no longer; the\r\nscientist in him was all-absorbing. He said once with satisfaction,\r\n\"Brett is competent--the boy hasn't varied a hair from my directions.\"\r\n\r\nI knew that he and Brett had picked up the image of the girl and\r\nher assailants within a month past; and that Brett had accurate\r\ncalculations which he could follow until able to capture the image on\r\nhis own instruments.\r\n\r\n\"How long will it take them to get there?\" I asked. \"When will they be\r\nback? You said within a few days. How long?\" Dr. Gryce looked up from\r\nhis work with a faint smile. \"There's no answer to that, Frank. Without\r\na change of their time it might take them to reach that realm out there\r\na thousand years or a million years--the vehicle's maximum velocity we\r\ndo not know--that they are to find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"A million years! And another million to come back!\"\r\n\r\nHis smile broadened. \"As we measure Time, yes. But they will change\r\ntheir Time-rate; the trip may seem to them only a few days.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I persisted, \"two million years of our Time! And we can not\r\nchange our Time.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Frank. But you speak thoughtlessly. Brett can return to any point\r\nin our Time he wishes. Not with exactitude--but, we hope, within a few\r\ndays. They will return here--within that Time we have agreed.\"\r\n\r\nFrannie's face was very solemn though she said nothing; and I knew then\r\nthat she was wondering if her brothers would be able to keep their\r\npromise.\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce rose from his chair. \"I must adjust the aural ray--Brett may\r\nneed it.\"\r\n\r\nHe had already explained this ray. A device similar to the familiar\r\naurometer by which the aural power of the earth is measured. He had\r\nperfected an instrument for projecting into Space the invisible aura of\r\nthe earth--projecting it in a tiny, very intense beam. An instrument\r\nfor visualizing its characteristic bands was in the vehicle. They hoped\r\nthat the ray might reach out into distant, interstellar Space; a flash\r\nof it crossing the sky as our earth rotated. And, coming back, Brett\r\nwould see it, recognize it. A guide, as he came back from beyond all\r\nthe universes strewn there throughout the magnitude of Space. If it\r\ncould reach out there--if he saw it. My heart sank at the thoughts,\r\ndoubts, which rushed upon me.\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce set his aural projector, with its ray, invisible to the naked\r\neye, flashing after the vehicle. Silently he returned to his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Can you see them? You can still see them, Frank?\" Frannie turned to me\r\nwith anxious face.\r\n\r\nI could still see the vehicle. But faintly, for faster than any mail\r\nflyer it was winging its way outward. Mars--approaching its closest\r\npoint to the earth now to bring a deluge of the Martian Mails--red Mars\r\nat midnight had been above us. The vehicle had gone that way; and now,\r\nvisually beside the planet, they were sinking together in the western\r\nsky. The stars were paling with the coming dawn. The east flushed with\r\nit, and presently I could see the vehicle no longer.\r\n\r\nAnd as I turned from my instrument, I heard Dr. Gryce. \"Why Frannie,\r\ngirl! You're worn out! Come, it's dawn--they've vanished.\"\r\n\r\nLittle Frannie had fallen asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 5_\r\n\r\n                              THE RETURN\r\n\r\n\r\nWe did not sight the vehicle the next night; it had seemingly passed\r\nbeyond range of my instrument. With the myrdoscope we hoped to catch\r\nit, but could not. The night following was overcast with clouds. But\r\nwe remained awake; Dr. Gryce seemed to feel that his sons might be\r\nreturning. It was pathetic to me, observing him quietly slipping away\r\nfrom us at intervals to wander among the wreckage of his garden, gazing\r\nanxiously upward.\r\n\r\nA week and still they had not come. What Dr. Gryce said to my Director\r\nI do not know; but he told me the Director was satisfied to have me\r\nremain away until my present business was finished. I had determined as\r\nmuch for myself. Not all the Directors in the Service could have taken\r\nme away from here, with Brett and Martt unheard from.\r\n\r\nLike a beacon day and night we made sure that our aural ray was\r\nflashing its beam. But would Brett see it?\r\n\r\nAnother week. Still no sign. Doubts, fears, terrors assailed us.\r\nWere we watching, waiting futilely for what would never come? The\r\nthought was in my mind--and I knew it was in the minds of Dr. Gryce and\r\nFrannie--but never once did we voice it. Had Brett and Martt, perhaps,\r\nreturned to our Past? With mechanism impaired, had they landed here in\r\nwhat we now called the Past--landed to find a wilderness of roaming\r\nsavages? Or to find this little Space we now called a house and garden,\r\na barren icy waste with men no more than beasts upon it? Or landed\r\nhere in our Future? Ourselves dead, gone and forgotten? A great city\r\nhere on this spot, perchance, with strange people and strange ways and\r\nnothing remaining of the loved ones they sought? Or were they lost and\r\nwandering in Space? Out there among myriad starry Universes hopeless to\r\nfind our infinitesimal Solar System? Or lost perhaps in Time, wandering\r\nthrough the eons searching for the little centuries, years, days that\r\nidentified their goal?\r\n\r\nOr, again, perhaps they had safely reached that outer realm? Perhaps,\r\nonce there, something had happened to prevent their return? In what\r\nwe now called the Present, perhaps they were out there, transfixed,\r\njust as to our vision that strange girl and her strange assailants\r\nwere transfixed--stricken of motion, with a passing of Time to us\r\ninsensible. Transfixed out there now, to take no more than a few\r\nbreaths, to move a hand, no more, during all the span of our own tiny\r\nlives?\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nI was sitting early one evening near the monight hour, alone with\r\nFrannie in the observation room. Dr. Gryce, in the room adjoining, had\r\nfallen asleep, worn by repressed anxiety and his now almost day and\r\nnight vigil. We were talking in half-whispers; and abruptly Frannie\r\nvoiced the fear that possessed us all.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Frank, can't you see them? Please, you must! Oh, I'm afraid\r\nthey're never coming back. Never--coming back.\"\r\n\r\nIt sounded so horrible. \"Hush, Frannie. You mustn't say things like\r\nthat.\" I put my arm around her, and suddenly like a child she flung\r\nherself to me; sobbed, and clung to me.\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Frannie. Don't cry--please don't cry. I'll look again. I might\r\nsee them now. I'll try to.\"\r\n\r\nI drew away from her; went back to my instrument. I had in mind to try\r\nthe myrdoscope, but all our efforts with it during the two weeks past\r\nhad been unavailing. It was a calm, clear evening. A broadly crescent\r\nmoon was falling into the west. Mars was well above the eastern\r\nhorizon; through the electro-telescope I looked that way. My circular\r\nfield was empty. Frannie was checking her sobs, interested with hope\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see them, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--not yet--_Yes_! I see them! Frannie, I see them!\"\r\n\r\nFrom visually above the red planet, out of nothingness a huge shape\r\nsuddenly materialized. It had not been there an instant before; it\r\nseemed for the space of a thought, a transparent ghost of the vehicle;\r\nsolidifying until even before I had told Frannie, I was aware that I\r\nsaw it there. The vehicle unmistakable.\r\n\r\n\"They've come, Frannie! I see them! Call your father. Dr. Gryce!\r\nThey've come! They're safe!\"\r\n\r\nHow my heart leaped to be able to say it! Frannie was calling; and Dr.\r\nGryce, no more than half awake, repeating, \"They've come? They're in\r\nsight? They're safe?\"\r\n\r\nThis gentle old man, how full of thankfulness his heart must have been!\r\nHe came stumbling into the room. \"Where are they, Frank? You can see\r\nthem, lad?\"\r\n\r\nI could see them indeed--plainly, for abruptly I realized that they\r\nwere no farther than just beyond the earth's atmosphere. And I could\r\nsee also the conventional vane flying at horizontal above the vehicle's\r\ntower to denote that all was well within. They had come. They were safe.\r\n\r\nThey landed in the garden. Like a wafting feather the vehicle floated\r\ndown under Brett's skilled guidance. It was of a size seemingly\r\nidentical with the one it had upon departure, but evidence of its trip\r\nwas everywhere visible. Its gleaming milk-white color was dulled. Its\r\nsides were pitted and scarred--the metal burned. A lower corner seemed\r\nfused into a shapeless lump.\r\n\r\nThe door slid open as we crowded forward. My heart was pounding. A\r\nsudden, irrelevant thought leaped to me--a thought, hope, that they\r\nmight have brought back with them that strangely beautiful girl they\r\nhad gone to rescue. A thought abruptly, fiercely poignant--yet with\r\nit a consciousness of its whimsicality that I--Frank Elgon--who loved\r\nFrannie Gryce, should be possessed of such incongruous desire.\r\n\r\nThe door was open. Brett and Martt--queerly garbed to seem almost\r\nstrangers--were crowding there, with no one else behind them. But\r\nalready I had forgotten the girl. Frannie's glad cries of welcome rang\r\nout; and Dr. Gryce's tremulous greeting; and I heard my own voice,\r\nstrangely calm, \"Well! Brett--Martt--you got back safely, didn't you?\r\nI'm so glad--we're all so glad!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 6_\r\n\r\n                 THE FLIGHT INTO TIME, SIZE AND SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThey seemed not tired, but undoubtedly they were hungry, famished; and\r\nbefore they would say a word of those strange things we knew they had\r\nto tell, they made us feed them. \"Regular food,\" as Martt laughingly\r\ncalled it. \"By the code! We've eaten for months weird things supposed\r\nto be edible. My digestion is ruined.\"\r\n\r\nMonths! They had been gone two weeks and two days into a realm where\r\nthose little sixteen days were no more than a tiny fraction of a\r\nsecond! Yet they spoke of months! It was very strange.\r\n\r\n\"Frannie! _Don't_ ask me that again.\" Martt affectionately tweaked her\r\nchin. \"We found her, I tell you. Wait till we've had supper--you'll\r\nhear.\"\r\n\r\nThey ate with the relish of those long deprived of accustomed food; and\r\nas we sat with them, forbearing to ask the eager questions flooding\r\nus, again I had that impression of the strangeness which had come to\r\nthem. It was not only their manner of dress, though that of itself was\r\nextraordinary. They wore shirts of a colored cloth with a high rolling\r\ncollar in front, low and open in back. Short trousers that were queerly\r\nwide and flapping at the knee, stockings that seemed of a soft gray\r\nleather and long-pointed shoes of a material I could not name. Over\r\nthe shirt a short jacket, wide-shouldered and with sleeves that puffed\r\nand flared; and a skirt to it at the waist which rolled upward. Their\r\nhats--which Frannie rescued from the vehicle--were solidly wooden of\r\naspect, with low circular crowns and triangular stiff brims.\r\n\r\nThe garb seemed grotesque; yet they took it so as a matter of course\r\nwhen once we ceased our comments--and they were so easy in it, so\r\nunconscious of it--that abruptly I realized it was my own viewpoint\r\nthat held the strangeness. Between them, also, there was a difference\r\nof aspect--a rationality to their characters. The colors of their\r\ngarments materially differed. Brett's clothes were more sober--less\r\nvivid, less extreme. His shirt was a somber brown; Martt's was a\r\nglaring green. Martt's jacket had additional bangles fastened to\r\nits cloth, it rolled higher in the skirt; tassels depended from his\r\nelbows longer than those Brett wore. His jacket sleeves were fuller;\r\nhis trousers flared more, and were a more brilliant hue. But I will\r\nsay that when after a time I became in a measure accustomed to his\r\nlooks, Martt was very handsome; and he carried himself with a sort of\r\nswinging, debonair grace and swagger wholly attractive.\r\n\r\nThey were strangers to us in their mode of dress; no one regarding\r\nthem could have named a nation of earth or any of the habited planets\r\nfrom which they might have come. Yet the strangeness went deeper than\r\ntheir clothes. They seemed older. A vague aspect of command seemed upon\r\nthem--especially did it envelop Brett, like an aura sensed but not\r\nseen. Martt's old jocularity was unchanged; no dignity, no reservation,\r\nno aloofness with us had been added to the new swagger. Yet beneath\r\nhis laughter there seemed always a hidden solemnity. And then I saw\r\nit all--this subtle strangeness that clung to them--I saw it lurking\r\nin their eyes. Memories mirrored there; memories of things no man had\r\nseen and felt before. Eyes--and more especially Brett's eyes--which had\r\nseen, perhaps, too much.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nIt was Brett who began their narrative; began it with the slow,\r\ncareful, precise phrasing of the scientist anxious to avoid error of\r\nmemory; to be exact of every fact and detail. On his lap he held a book\r\nof notes, and another book of the many dial recordings. He consulted it.\r\n\r\n\"Our recorded time of starting was four minutes past midnight. Sixteen\r\ndays ago, wasn't it, Father? Sixteen!\"\r\n\r\nHe gave a queer laugh but did not comment upon his thoughts. \"I had\r\ndetermined to start slowly. Martt would have rushed us, but I thought\r\nthat caution was best until we were quite sure of the workings of these\r\nmechanisms new to us.\r\n\r\n\"I did not record our passing above the earth's atmosphere. But the\r\nvehicle was inordinately hot from the friction of our passage. Perhaps\r\nI took it too fast--at all events we did not bother with refrigeration\r\nsince in Space we would so soon need the heaters. We sat sweltering at\r\nthe main instrument table with the dials before us.\r\n\r\n\"I think, Father, that I followed your instructions carefully. The\r\ndials were all set and operating. The size-dials stood motionless at\r\nunit 1. Our relative Time-dials were motionless at the original unit of\r\nearth Time; and the earth dial-chronometers ticked off the passing of\r\nyour seconds and minutes. On the Space-dials--when first I chanced to\r\nnotice them--we had gone some 900 miles. Our velocity then had picked\r\nup to 1,500 miles an hour and was swiftly accelerating. The Time was 1\r\na.m.\r\n\r\n\"It is slow getting through the atmosphere, but now we were fairly on\r\nour way. As you suggested, Father, I was heading just a point off Mars\r\nwhere I could hold Jupiter and Saturn almost in a line ahead of us.\r\nThey were all there visible through our floor window--we had turned\r\nover and were falling toward them. I was using a fraction only of the\r\nearth's repulsion, and holding steady with the selective attraction of\r\nMars and the star-field behind it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We saw your aural ray,\" Martt put in. He was earnestly intent upon\r\nBrett's narrative. \"We saw it--I saw it--through the spectrometer. The\r\nswing of it was apparent even at that near distance. And we saw the\r\nMartian Mail coming in--they landed in Eurasia that night, I suppose.\r\nSay, they move in a hurry, don't they? And stop in a hurry when they\r\nget down close.\"\r\n\r\nBrett went on: \"We were still within the lower cone of the earth's\r\nshadow. But presently we emerged and came into the sunlight. The\r\nbrilliant blackness of Space; and the cold by now had penetrated so\r\nthat very soon we were glad enough to use the heaters.\r\n\r\n\"You know the details of a Martian voyage, Father. And you, Frank? This\r\nwas no different except that having no necessity of stopping I reached\r\na greater velocity than they generally obtain. A forty-hour trip, isn't\r\nit, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nearly always one of the minimum-distance trips at about\r\nthat,\" I answered. \"But you had some sixty million miles for yours.\r\nThat's a lot longer than a minimum distance.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \"Yes. We came abreast of Mars--I suppose about a million\r\nmiles away. Our Space-dials showed about sixty-two million miles\r\ntraveled. We had been gone from you thirty-nine hours. Our average\r\nvelocity had been something over a million and a half miles an hour,\r\nand with steadily increasing acceleration had reached then nearly three\r\nmillion an hour.\r\n\r\n\"That was as quick a trip as you anticipated, Father? But even so, we\r\nfound it irksome. We alternated at the instrument board. Martt prepared\r\nmost of the meals--beyond that and sleeping there was little to do.\r\nExcept to watch for asteroids; but the mails have reported the region\r\nthrough there remarkably free of them this season. We saw none inside\r\nthe Martian orbit closer than a million miles, which to such a low\r\nvelocity as ours held no danger.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce asked, \"The air purifiers, Brett? You had no trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Or very little, except just at first with the chlorate of\r\npotassium. I was telling you about passing Mars. We saw it rising\r\nslowly past us--saw it through a side window. A huge crescent, the\r\nsunlight on half its disk, but even the unlighted portion was plainly\r\noutlined. Above us was the thin crescent earth, with the sun behind it.\r\nThe tongues of flame in the sun's envelope were plainer than I had ever\r\nseen them. We were falling away from the earth and sun, into the inky\r\nblackness of Space with its blazing white stars.\r\n\r\n\"During all this first portion of the trip we were eager to get more\r\nquickly advanced. Beyond Neptune's orbit, with the Solar System once\r\nbehind us, we would feel like explorers, even though Nogar--he holds\r\nthe record, doesn't he?--went once 27,000 million miles out.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce put in: \"His record was 27,600 million miles from our sun.\r\nAt nearly five million miles an hour, which was his maximum velocity\r\nobtainable, that trip for the full return passage consumed--I think the\r\ntotal time was 461 days.\"\r\n\r\nBrett went on, \"That was the record. But even to go a single light-year\r\nat that velocity would have taken Nogar around 84 years--just going out\r\na little light-year of distance, to say nothing of getting back! And we\r\nhad so many thousands of light-years to travel even to get beyond the\r\nstars. It seemed stupendous--impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally,\" said Dr. Gryce. \"Impossible, of course, had you held to\r\nthat size.\" They were directing their explanations at me. I nodded.\r\n\"But you didn't stay that size?\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"No, of course not,\" said Brett. \"But for a time, we did--I was\r\ncautious from Mars to Jupiter, Father. Nogar plunged right through the\r\nasteroid region there--plunged through at nearly his five million\r\nmiles an hour velocity. I held down to three million. We kept a close\r\nwatch, though Martt had a somewhat terrifying experience. Tell them,\r\nMartt.\"\r\n\r\nMartt flushed a trifle. \"It wasn't my fault--at least I didn't think\r\nso. At a velocity like that the space there between the orbits of\r\nMars and Jupiter is horribly crowded. Brett was asleep. I sat by the\r\ninstrument table staring down into the floor window at the black\r\nfirmament into which we were dropping. You people take a voyage like\r\nthis as a matter of course--but it was my first time off earth, and the\r\nbeauty of it--of the heavens--well, I tell you it impressed me. The\r\nblack firmament--those blazing constellations beneath us--the full moon\r\nof Jupiter every moment growing larger like a white round lamp down\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyway, perhaps, I was lost in thoughts of it--when leaping\r\nup out of the blackness came a great round silver disk. A hundred\r\ntimes the size of our full moon. Then a thousand. It was below me,\r\nbut off to one side. It swept past, so close I could see its barren,\r\nrocky surface--a range of desolate gray mountains; and I could see,\r\ntoo, its rotation, like a ball tossed into the air slowly rotating.\r\nBefore I could think to do anything--even to make a move--the asteroid\r\nwent past, out of my field as I looked through the floor window. For\r\na moment I saw it rising past a side window and then it was above\r\nus--gone completely beyond my sight in a moment or two. I want to tell\r\nyou I was frightened--I called Brett down at once.\"\r\n\r\nBrett laughed. \"I found him white, shaking like a tower-trembler.\r\nIf a collision had really threatened, he could have thrown the main\r\nTime-switch. Thrown us suddenly into the asteroid's past or future--I\r\nhad told him that--but when the danger came, he never thought of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never did,\" Martt confessed.\r\n\r\n\"How close did the asteroid pass?\" I asked. \"I saw one once, on a\r\nMartian trip----\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we passed it at a distance of some three thousand miles,\"\r\nBrett answered. \"But at three million miles an hour we were traveling\r\nthat distance in three or four seconds. It was a narrow escape. The\r\nasteroid's attraction had drawn us aside from our course--but I soon\r\nrectified that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I meant to explain about attraction a moment ago, Frank,\" Dr. Gryce\r\ninterrupted. \"The attraction of the vehicle on our planets is why\r\nBrett could not yet increase his size. Jupiter and Saturn were pulling\r\nthe vehicle onward, and in direct proportion to the mass, of course,\r\nthe vehicle was pulling at them. An infinitesimal pull--but had Brett\r\nincreased its size materially--while still close to our planets--the\r\nvehicle would have been a seriously disturbing element. I did not want\r\nthat. Indeed, with any great size-increase, the vehicle moving out\r\nthere would have thrown our whole system into chaos.\"\r\n\r\nBrett said, \"I was careful to obey you, Father. We were safely\r\nbeyond Saturn--and Uranus and Neptune were on the other side of the\r\nsun--before I even touched the size-switch. From the orbit of Mars to\r\nthat of Jupiter there are some 334 million miles between the points\r\nwe crossed. We were about 112 hours making the voyage. I kept us well\r\naway--some ten million miles. But the planet was a beautiful sight,\r\nassuming every phase from full to crescent as we passed. You have never\r\nbeen so close, Father? Nor you, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" spoke up Frannie. She said it in a whimsical fashion of\r\npathos, as though to make us all realize that she had been neglected.\r\n\r\nBrett laughed affectionately. \"No, nor you, little sister. Well, it's\r\na beautiful sight. You can see it similarly in the telescope, but\r\nsomehow, at the same visual distance the naked eye shows it indefinably\r\ndifferent. A beautiful silver disk with the broad dark bands upon it\r\nand the red spot glowing like a lantern in its lower hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\"Our velocity was slackened for a time as we passed Jupiter, since\r\nI had to lose its great attractive force and turn a neutral side to\r\nit. But once by it, with it blazing as a gigantic thin crescent above\r\nus, I used a full power of its repulsion. We gained velocity rapidly.\r\nWith the region of minor planets passed I had no fear of using all the\r\nvelocity we could obtain. I think Nogar was unskilful in the handling\r\nof his vehicle; at all events, before we reached the neighborhood of\r\nSaturn, we had attained a velocity of seven and a half million miles an\r\nhour. It was the greatest velocity we reached.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I exclaimed, \"but Brett, at seven and one-half million miles\r\nan hour, in your whole life-time--whether you changed your Time-rate\r\nor not, you would have to live those hours--in a whole life-time at\r\nthat velocity you wouldn't get one-quarter of the distance even to the\r\nnearest star!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he agreed. \"But I began using the size-change after we passed\r\nSaturn----\"\r\n\r\nI interrupted again. \"I've been wondering about that--I don't quite\r\nsee----\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll make it clear to you, Frank, in a moment,\" Dr. Gryce put in. \"Go\r\non, Brett.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were well past Saturn before I changed our size at all. Our average\r\nvelocity along there was six million miles an hour--it was a run of\r\nabout seventy-five hours. We would have been--even at our maximum of\r\nseven and one-half million miles an hour--more than another 240 hours\r\ngetting past Neptune's orbit. It was too tedious. We determined, since\r\nUranus and Neptune were in other parts of their orbits--far on the\r\nother side of our sun--I decided that once we were well beyond Saturn,\r\nI would start our increase of size. We were seventy million miles\r\nbeyond Saturn, with nothing of importance ahead of us but the distant\r\nstars, when I determined to start the change. The space there was\r\ncomparatively deserted--a few asteroids--sometimes we could go nearly\r\nan hour without even sighting one.\r\n\r\n\"With Martt beside me--we were both a little timid about it,\r\nnaturally--I threw over the switch and started our growth.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused for the length of a breath. \"It was extraordinary--all our\r\nexperience of the voyage from that moment was extraordinary. I hardly\r\nknow how to begin telling you. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce interrupted. \"Just a minute, Brett--I want to make absolutely\r\nclear to Frank the principles involved in this change of size in\r\nrelation to velocity.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask a question first?\" I hazarded.\r\n\r\n\"All you like,\" said Brett.\r\n\r\n\"I'm wondering why in your normal size you could attain no greater\r\nvelocity than seven and one-half million miles an hour. Theoretically,\r\nyou know, a freely falling body will accelerate to infinity. And\r\nwith repulsion added--a body, not only falling, but being _pushed_\r\ndownward----\"\r\n\r\nFrannie said, \"Nogar found his approximate limit at five million----\"\r\n\r\n\"Our limitations were similar to his,\" Martt put in.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" I said. \"I remember in the public newscasting they said----\"\r\n\r\n\"We found the same conditions,\" Brett put in. \"Our vehicle--any vehicle\r\ntraveling in outer Space--is not strictly a freely falling body. For\r\nlow velocities--the general voyaging from here to Mercury, Venus or\r\nMars--Space may almost be considered a vacuum. But it is not a vacuum,\r\nas we know. The imponderable, widely separated atoms of the ether--to\r\nuse the ancient word--begin to be a factor at velocities over three\r\nmillion miles an hour. The drag became increasingly noticeable----\"\r\n\r\n\"And the heat of the friction warmed us up,\" Martt put in. \"At six\r\nmillion miles an hour we were hot, let me tell you. Sweltering--even\r\nwith the full refrigeration units going.\"\r\n\r\n\"That friction held us to seven and one-half million as our limit,\"\r\nBrett added. \"Anything else, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I was wondering about our aural ray here. Could you still see it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. Our sun of the Solar System had dwindled--small, but white\r\nand brilliant. With the naked eye the little star which was our earth\r\nshowed very faint but distinguishable. With the aurometer--even using\r\nits spreading field of vision so that it embraced all that portion of\r\nthe sky--we could see your beam sweeping slowly across the field as the\r\nearth rotated.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the myrdoscope?\" I suggested. \"Hadn't you tried again to locate\r\nthe image of that girl?\" My heart thumped as I said it.\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \"Beyond Jupiter, when the long hours of inactivity hung on\r\nus, I spent many of them searching ahead of us with the myrdoscope. At\r\nlast I picked up the image of the girl--held it for a few moments.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no change?\" Dr. Gryce said eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"No. The little distance we had traveled made no change--in fact, my\r\nsmaller instrument, Father, showed it rather less clearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean no change in the girl's attitude,\" Dr. Gryce insisted. \"No\r\nchange in the attacking giant--or those grinning little dwarfs at the\r\ngirl's ankle?\"\r\n\r\n\"None. But she was aware of them. On her face was stark terror--as\r\nwe had seen it from here, Father, a month before. I noticed that the\r\ngiant's forward step had nearly been completed--and the climbing dwarf\r\nwas holding tightly to her sandal cord.\"\r\n\r\nBrett gazed at me inquiringly but I shook my head. \"That's all I have\r\nto ask,\" I said. \"Go ahead, Brett. You were telling us about how you\r\nstarted the size-change----\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce put in. \"I think you had best proceed, Brett. And then if\r\nthere is anything Frank does not understand, we can stop and make it\r\nclear.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded, but for a moment he hesitated. \"I flung over the switch to\r\nstart our growth,\" he said slowly. \"It was the beginning of all those\r\nstrangely weird experiences which followed now one upon the other.\r\nFrightening at first. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\nHe paused briefly, then went on: \"Our first sensation was one of\r\nshock--a reeling of the senses. But it was not severe--it passed almost\r\nat once. We found ourselves clinging there to the instrument table.\r\nTo me the room seemed swaying dizzily. My forehead was damp with cold\r\nmoisture; a nausea possessed me. I was oppressed; the air of the room\r\nwas heavy to breathe.\"\r\n\r\n\"The air was snapping with the current,\" said Martt. \"I could see it,\r\nand feel it tingling against my face. And it was heavy to breathe, as\r\nBrett says.\"\r\n\r\nBrett resumed: \"But we felt better after a moment. I saw the change\r\nfirst on the dials. The pointer of the lowest unit dial of the size\r\nseries was slowly but visibly moving. I watched as it crept from 1 to\r\n2. We had doubled in size. I gazed about the room. It was unchanged;\r\nand now as my body rapidly adjusted itself to the new conditions, I\r\nbegan to feel almost normal. Except a queer whirring in my head, and\r\nthe nausea which persisted for perhaps an hour, I felt no evidence\r\nof the growth. The room, the vehicle was untrembling. No slightest\r\nevidence within the vehicle of the size-change going on--except the\r\ncreeping pointer of the lowest dial. It was moving faster; it had\r\nreached 10. The pointer of the dial beside it--registering in units of\r\na hundred--now seemed stirring.\"\r\n\r\nBrett gazed at us earnestly. \"I want to make myself absolutely clear.\r\nWe were then--I suppose a minute or so had elapsed--we were ten times\r\nour original size----\"\r\n\r\n\"Much faster than the vehicle grew in the garden,\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I had chanced the possibility of severe shock and thrown the\r\nlever at once to a quarter strength. Martt and Frannie, in the garden,\r\nhad put it on only to the one-hundredth part of its power. At all\r\nintensities, the growth, you understand, constantly accelerates.\r\nAt unit 10, which we reached in possibly the first minute, we were\r\nten times our starting size--that is, for earth measurements, our\r\nvehicle from base to tower-top was then one-tenth of a mile. But\r\nsoon the pointer had passed 50. And then 100--and the pointer of the\r\nhundred-unit dial had crept to 1.\r\n\r\n\"With recovered normality of senses we had gone to the windows. I\r\nwant you to visualize first what always before we had seen. An\r\ninky black void everywhere surrounding us, in the center of which\r\nseemingly we hung motionless. The brilliant firmament of stars, freed\r\nfrom the distortion of earth's atmosphere; glittering, blazing like\r\ngreat diamonds. Pure white, blue-white, or tinged with yellow and\r\nred. The whole extent of the heavens swarming with them. The huge,\r\nspiral nebulous masses fleecy white, with tiny points of blazing\r\nwhite fire in them. And behind them all that distant ring of seeming\r\nstar-dust--immeasurably distant yet glowing like a silver veil, which\r\nin the ancient books they called the 'Milky Way.'\r\n\r\n\"Near at hand, above us were the tiny planets of our Solar System. The\r\nsun, only a pale white disk from out here near Saturn; the earth--a\r\nstar very faint; red Mars, a tiny reddish dot. But Jupiter was\r\nbrilliant; and Saturn from our proximity was stupendously beautiful.\r\nThe globe itself--a great silver disk, with the sunlight to make a\r\nnarrow portion of it into a blazing crescent. The darkened areas of the\r\nglobe, even on the shadowed portion, were plain almost as the bands of\r\nJupiter. And Saturn's rings! Concentric rings--the inner one a trifle\r\ndarker--opened up to a narrow angle--a glowing silver band like a broad\r\nhat-brim encircling the planet--a hat-brim over 37,000 miles broad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Saturn with its rings was stupendously beautiful from\r\nour proximity.\"]\r\n\r\n\"This we saw, with ourselves of unchanging size. But now we were\r\ngrowing. The change was at first apparent only in the aspect of\r\nSaturn--since it was closest to us. The planet seemed to become a\r\nlittle smaller--shrinking and creeping toward us. A contraction of its\r\nsize--and as though the space between us were diminishing. Yet--as\r\na seeming paradox--the visual diameter of the globe and the rings\r\nremained almost the same.\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to describe. We seemed moving closer to Saturn, yet\r\nin no sense was there any apparent motion. The effect--the result--of\r\nseeming motion--not the motion itself. Martt presently went back to\r\nwatch the dials. He called out to me when we had reached unit 1,000. A\r\nthousand times our original size--the vehicle now ten miles in earthly\r\nheight. The change had now affected very slightly the entire firmament.\r\nEverywhere a seeming contraction--not so much in the aspect of the\r\nblazing star-points, but in the black void of Space itself. As though\r\nthe void were smaller--contracted so that everything in it were of\r\nnecessity a little nearer to us. But it was as yet barely noticeable. I\r\nmight even have thought it a psychological co-action with the change in\r\nSaturn's aspect--a change unmistakable.\r\n\r\n\"Saturn, as we grew, had been seemingly smaller and coming visually\r\nnearer to us. Yet our velocity away from it was--in our original\r\nsize--seven and one-half million miles an hour. Can I make you realize\r\nthat the effect of _both_ motions was apparent? It was as though we\r\nwere moving forward to lengthen a dwindling distance, with Saturn\r\nfollowing after us simultaneously to shorten it.\r\n\r\n\"It was at the thousand unit point--ourselves then ten miles of earthly\r\nheight--that I shut off the size-switch. Of visual diameter, Saturn had\r\nreally not altered materially.\"\r\n\r\nBrett stopped as though carefully to choose his words. \"I'm striving\r\nto give you a clear picture. A distant object of great size may\r\nappear of the same diameter as something smaller and closer. But\r\nyou can generally tell which is which. There is a difference of\r\naspect--impossible to describe, but readily seen. Saturn was like\r\nthat--the change in the planet was like a progressive change from\r\nthe one condition to the other. It had appeared large and distant;\r\nit changed, to be smaller and closer. Just before I shut off the\r\nsize-switch, when our rate of growth had become comparatively rapid,\r\nSaturn took on other motions--I'll tell you about them in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Do I make myself clear? I want to. . . . With our growth checked,\r\nthere was at once a striking, visual result. We seemed receding from\r\nSaturn so fast that its apparent diameter dwindled very rapidly--a\r\nnormal dwindling of rapidly added distance. Presently it was a mere\r\nstar--then a pin-point of light. Then it was vanished. Our other\r\nplanets of the Solar System had preceded Saturn into invisibility. Then\r\nour sun itself became so faint a star that I lost it. We were beyond\r\nthe Solar System--itself wholly lost to the naked eye among the great\r\nstar-clusters enveloping it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" I exclaimed. \"There is so much I want to ask you, Brett.\"\r\n\r\nFrannie interposed timidly: \"Did you say, Brett, that on earth the\r\nvehicle then would have been ten miles in height?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he agreed.\r\n\r\nShe commented, \"Then your relative Time-dials must have been visibly\r\nmoving----\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce hastily interrupted: \"The practical workings of the inherent\r\nTime-change I want Brett to explain carefully. You did not move the\r\nvehicle in Time, did you, Brett?\"\r\n\r\n\"No sir. Not then.\"\r\n\r\nI must have looked puzzled, for Dr. Gryce added: \"We mean, Frank, that\r\nthe vehicle could have traveled in Time--in earth-Time, for instance,\r\nto go into our past or our future. Brett had not done that. But\r\nimmediately the vehicle started a size-change, you understand, there\r\nautomatically began a Time-change inherent to that growth. Normal to\r\nit, let me say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" I nodded. \"I remember you explained that. In relation to its\r\nsize----\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll put it this way,\" Dr. Gryce went on. \"That girl out there is\r\nmoving through Time at a definite rate. Let us say a year of our Time\r\nwould be measured as a second of hers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Less than that,\" Martt interjected.\r\n\r\n\"Yes lad, I know. But those rough figures will serve for the present\r\ncomparison.\" He turned back to me. \"Keep that in mind, Frank. Now\r\nconceive Brett and Martt changing progressively upward in size, from\r\nwhat they are here on earth, to a size normal to that girl and the\r\nrealm she lives in. A corresponding Time-change must take place. At\r\nevery point of the voyage in Time and size, the relative values must\r\nagree; the vehicle's Time-rate always must be in inverse proportion to\r\nits position in size.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded. \"I think I understand. You mean that when in size the vehicle\r\nhad progressed half-way from our size to the girl's, that then the\r\nvehicle's normal Time-rate would be half-way between our Time and hers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, Frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"At this ten-mile size what percentage of the size-journey had been\r\nmade?\" I asked. I smiled. \"I'm trying to imagine how large that girl\r\nmay be.\"\r\n\r\nBrett said quickly, \"I'll tell you that later. It was some distance\r\nfarther on before I could calculate such relative values even as\r\napproximations.\"\r\n\r\nFrannie said, \"At that point, Brett, the vehicle began speeding into\r\nthe earth's future, didn't it?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce exclaimed: \"Child, that will only lead us into philosophical\r\ndiscussion. Beyond the realm of mathematics----\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so, Father,\" Brett said quietly. \"I would say that\r\nsince everything--Size, Time and Space--is relative, depending\r\nwholly on the viewpoint of the observer--that Frannie's question is\r\nsimple enough. To me as observer--to my consciousness there in the\r\nvehicle--every given instant was the Present. The earth was out there\r\nin Space, revolving about its sun; rotating on its axis--its movements\r\nto my consciousness _faster_ than before. To me it was the Present.\r\nThe earth was there. I saw it through the electro-telescope. I also\r\nsaw your aural ray through the aurometer. The ray swept the sky with\r\na rapid sweep, since to my altered Time-rate the earth was rotating\r\nfaster. But every given instant was my Present.\r\n\r\n\"However, compare my consciousness to yours on earth. The\r\nearth--rotating faster relative to me--had, while I watched there,\r\nmade, let us say, a full rotation in that first five minutes of my\r\nvigil. Relative to me--it was the earth's future Time. I was gazing\r\nupon earth in its _tomorrow_. So I think that I was, as Frannie said,\r\nspeeding into the earth's future.\"\r\n\r\nFrannie was triumphant. Dr. Gryce said smilingly, \"You put it\r\nclearly, Brett. But it's a philosophical and metaphysical viewpoint\r\nnevertheless. You spoke of Saturn's having another apparent motion near\r\nthe end of your size-change?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Brett. \"As our Time-rate became materially slower, the\r\nspeeding up of all the motions inherent to the planets grew visible.\r\nSaturn's rotation on its axis became readily visible through the\r\ntelescope. And the globe began very slowly shifting sidewise--at nearly\r\nright angles to our course--the visual result of the intensification of\r\nits orbital movement. . . . You were going to ask a question, Frank, a\r\nmoment ago?\"\r\n\r\nI had not forgotten it. \"You were telling us, Brett, how you stopped\r\nyour growth at the ten-mile size. Almost immediately, you said, Saturn\r\nreceded into an invisibility of distance. The entire Solar System\r\nvanished into distance. You had been traveling only seven and one-half\r\nmillion miles an hour before changing size. It was the new velocity I\r\nwanted to ask about. The whole question of velocity relative to size.\"\r\n\r\n\"Relative!\" Brett exclaimed. \"That's the keynote to it, Frank. Two\r\ndiffering viewpoints, always. Keep them both in mind--the viewpoint\r\nof earth-size, and the viewpoint of the vehicle-size. I'll try and\r\nexplain it now. Once clear to you, our whole experience will clarify to\r\nyour understanding. Conceive, from your external viewpoint of earth,\r\nthe vehicle out there in Space dropping with a velocity of seven and\r\none-half million miles an hour. That was its maximum, owing to the\r\nether-friction. It started to increase in size. Hence its mass grew--in\r\nproportion directly as the cube. As the mass grew greater, the atoms\r\nof the ether became of themselves relatively smaller, less ponderable,\r\nless capable of exerting their frictional drag.\r\n\r\n\"This should be very clear to you, Frank. In a vacuum, a feather\r\nand a bit of lead fall at equal rates. The mass--the weight--has\r\nnothing to do with it. But in air--where there is a friction--the\r\nheavier object falls faster. The vehicle was like that. Its mass, so\r\nenormously increased, gave it a greatly increased maximum velocity. It\r\npicked up velocity rapidly with its growth. The formulas involved are\r\nintricate--I need only say that after forty-nine minutes of traveling\r\nat the ten-mile size, we had again reached maximum. It was about 200\r\nmillion miles a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"A minute!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. That is 12,000 million miles an hour, as against seven and\r\none-half million. The vehicle's length, breadth and width had each\r\nincreased to a thousand times their former size. Its mass was the\r\nproduct of the three--hence one thousand million times greater.\r\n\r\n\"These are all approximate to the actual figures, you understand. Round\r\nnumbers are less confusing. Our resultant velocity, however, was 200\r\nmillion miles a minute, at the end of the first hour. We were well\r\nbeyond the Solar System by then.\"\r\n\r\nFrannie asked, \"Brett, why didn't Saturn appear to recede until after\r\nyou had stopped your growth?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was merely optical, Frannie. Our velocity away from Saturn was\r\nsteadily increasing. But with our increasing size, the space seemed\r\ndwindling--as though Saturn were following after us. With the growth\r\nchecked there was a visual reaction--an apparent leaping away. It was\r\nmerely optical. Anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know,\" I said, \"the relation of your Time in the vehicle\r\nat the ten-mile size--its relation to our earth-Time.\"\r\n\r\n\"The proportion of one to one thousand,\" he answered readily. \"Seven\r\nseconds to me, then, was about two hours on earth. Could I have seen\r\nthe earth when I reached that maximum, it would have made a complete\r\nrotation on its axis--a day of yours--in a minute and twenty-four\r\nseconds to me.\r\n\r\n\"It's all clear, isn't it? Suppose I go back to the details of our\r\ntrip? With ten miles of earthly size, at a velocity of 200 million\r\nmiles a minute we were dropping into the black void of Space. The Solar\r\nSystem was lost presently, even to telescopic vision, but with the\r\nnaked eye the firmament of stars was very little changed. I searched\r\nwith the myrdoscope for the image of the girl, but did not chance to\r\npick it up. We were hot again within the vehicle, from the ether\r\nfriction--as hot as we had been before.\r\n\r\n\"Beneath us, in the star-field for which I was heading, was Alpha\r\nCentauri. It is, as you know, one of the very closest stars to our\r\nSolar System--to our earth. In miles, roughly some 25,000,000,000,000.\r\nFour and a third light-years of distance, 4.35 light-years to be exact.\r\nAt 200 million miles a minute we would have been some eighty-eight days\r\ngetting there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't have stood a trip so long,\" Martt exclaimed. \"I told him\r\nwe'd have to increase our size again. Nearly three months to get to the\r\nnearest star--with others a thousand times farther on!\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no reason for us to stay so small,\" Brett agreed. \"Out\r\nthere, with the Solar System so far away, I had no fear of disturbing\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAgain I interrupted. \"Brett, the vehicle's velocity was then much\r\ngreater than the velocity of light----\"\r\n\r\n\"About eighteen times greater.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems inconceivable,\" I added. \"Impossible for any tangible entity\r\nin Space to attain such velocity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but Frank, that's where you're using the wrong viewpoint,\" Dr.\r\nGryce exclaimed warmly. \"You're still imagining yourself an observer on\r\nearth. But take the viewpoint of the vehicle. Space was proportionately\r\nsmaller than before. Brett gives you the earth-size figures in order to\r\navoid confusion. From the vehicle's enlarged viewpoint, Brett, what was\r\nits comparative velocity?\"\r\n\r\n\"About twelve million miles an hour,\" Brett said. \"As against a former\r\nseven and one-half million. Not so great a change, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I admitted. \"But----\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can not quite grasp how the two velocities can be the same?\r\nExisting simultaneously in the same vehicle, only with a differing\r\nviewpoint?\"\r\n\r\nI think that was my trouble. I nodded, and he said at once, \"To the\r\nlarger viewpoint, Frank, the Space had diminished a thousand times, to\r\nmake a thousand miles become as one mile. Not an _actual_ change--a\r\nrelative change only. But twelve million miles an hour, with distance\r\ndiminished one thousand times, is the same as twelve thousand million\r\nmiles an hour with the distance factor unaltered. You see that, of\r\ncourse. Or consider the relative Time-values. The vehicle's Time\r\nwas seven seconds to about two hours. The exact figures were one to\r\none thousand. In the vehicle we lived a thousand earth-seconds in one.\r\nApplied, then, to the two viewpoints of velocity, it gives identical\r\nresults for the distance traveled. Whatever the factors involved--the\r\nearth-Time; the vehicle-Time; the Space relative to the vehicle; or to\r\nthe earth; and the velocity, relative either to the vehicle-size or\r\nearth-size--the result must be mathematically the same. You see? And,\r\nFrank, in describing the progressive size-changes into which we now\r\nplunged, I shall give you always Space with earth-standards, and our\r\nvelocity from the viewpoint of earth. It reached tremendous figures;\r\nbut you are to remember always that of actuality they must be divided\r\nby the relative size factor. They were never greater than you would\r\nhave expected the vehicle to obtain.\r\n\r\n\"I was saying that we were headed for Alpha Centauri. Again we started\r\nthe growth. I threw the switch to its fullest intensity. Martt stayed\r\nto watch the dials; I sat on the floor, gazing down through the window\r\nat the star-field spread out beneath me. When my head had cleared from\r\nthe shock of starting the growth, I sat absorbed in watching. Soon\r\nvisible movements appeared. The star-drifts began to be apparent. And\r\nwe were going toward these stars; the apparent shortening Space, added\r\nto our increasing relative velocity, made their approach visible. In\r\nthe field to the sides of us, the stars were shifting upward. Those in\r\nfront were spreading apart with a movement very slow but perceptible as\r\nwe dropped toward them.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know how long I sat there; Martt occasionally would call to\r\nme from his post at the dials, but I hardly heard him. Alpha Centauri\r\npresently came rushing forward. As you know, it is a binary--twin stars\r\na few hundred million miles apart, its components revolving about each\r\nother with a period of eighty-one years. It had been one blazing white\r\npoint of light. Then it separated into two. They stayed visually small,\r\nfor they were dwindling before the vehicle's growth; but they came\r\nrushing toward us. Soon I could see them separated by a narrow black\r\nribbon of the void; and could see them revolving one about the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"An eighty-one-year period, and you could see it!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--a very slow movement, but I could see it. I would have passed\r\nbetween them--the ribbon of Space there was widening rapidly, the stars\r\nthemselves had become great, blazing white-hot suns. But I was afraid\r\nof the heat; I altered our course to present a slightly repellent side.\r\nThe firmament turned partly over. The two stars swung up past our side\r\nwindow; in visual diameter larger than our earthly sun--they mounted\r\nupward, closed in above us, drew together to form one; a sun at first;\r\nthen a brilliant star; then faint, until with the naked eye I lost it.\r\n\r\n\"Beneath us, the star-field in front was rushing upward much faster\r\nnow. The constellations opening; the stars shifting--everywhere was\r\nmovement--strange movement, unnatural, fantastic. I confess, Father,\r\nthat I was injudicious. Martt was absorbed, fascinated in watching the\r\ndials, and when occasionally he would call to me, I told him everything\r\nwas all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know what was going on,\" said Martt. \"You told me to sit\r\nthere and I sat there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you didn't know what was going on,\" Brett smiled. \"But I\r\ndid, and I think for a time I lost my wits. The stars were thick and\r\nclose around us. The nebulĂ¦ were opened into individual points of fire.\r\nEverywhere was movement, unreal. Stars rotating visibly; binaries\r\nshifting about each other; other stars shifting about each other; other\r\nstars seeming to enlarge in size, or to diminish, to swing this way\r\nor that with all the optical vagaries of our velocity, our changing\r\nTime and Size; and always those of the star-field in front--beneath\r\nus--spreading to the sides, rushing past our windows, closing in above\r\nus and fading into invisibility.\r\n\r\n\"A myriad universes in fantastic motion. And suddenly I realized that\r\nthese giant suns were very close to us, and very small! Some I had\r\nrecognized--blazing globes 100 million miles and more in diameter,\r\nand thought myself ten times that far from them. But it was not so.\r\nI stared at a giant globe 100 million miles in diameter, and with\r\nmy viewpoint suddenly changed I saw that it was no more than a tiny\r\nglowing meteor, sweeping past a few miles away!\r\n\r\n\"All this star-field, little balls, rolling close upon us. A miracle\r\nthat none hit us, though some time before, I had had the wit to call\r\nto Martt to make all the faces repellent. By inertia only, we plunged\r\nonward, repelling what lay in our path.\r\n\r\n\"I saw a wandering asteroid--a few hundred miles perhaps in diameter.\r\nIt was whirling on its axis like a ball thrown into the air. A\r\nwhimsical humor--a madness perhaps--had descended upon me. There was\r\nnothing but the asteroid momentarily close before us, and I called to\r\nMartt to throw attraction into the bottom of the vehicle. The asteroid\r\ncame rushing. But shrinking--shrinking until I laughed aloud to see it\r\ndwindle to a ball I could have held in my hand; and dwindle further\r\nuntil impotently it struck the floor window with a tiny point of fire\r\nfrom its fusing rock and metal. A burning cinder which scarce would\r\nhave hurt me had I caught it in my naked hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI\r\n\r\n\"How long my mood of ironic madness may have lasted I can not say. I\r\nbarely noticed our actual entry into the Galactic Plane. Enormous suns\r\nwhirling past, now relatively not many times bigger than the vehicle\r\nitself. Others, distant a mile or so--or a billion miles if you want\r\nthe other viewpoint--with their magnified drift making them dart\r\ncrazily past. I gave no heed to passing time; I remember only that at\r\nlast the star-field beneath us was thinning out. Stray clusters--a\r\nmyriad glowing little balls hurled aside by our rush. But there were\r\nvisibly less and less of them, until, quite suddenly, I realized that\r\nunbroken inky darkness lay ahead. And to the sides and above us, the\r\nstar clusters, nebulĂ¦ swirling like silver mist--it was all fading.\r\nWinking little points up there behind us--winking and vanishing.\r\n\r\n\"We were in blackness unbroken. Dropping into a void of blackness\r\nwith velocity inconceivable. Suddenly I was frightened. Stiff from\r\nso long upon the floor, I rose and hurried to Martt. We shut off the\r\nsize-switch; made all the faces repellent. But there was nothing to\r\nrepel; nothing to stop our downward rush into that blackness. It\r\nseemed all at once a blackness pregnant with unseen things of fearsome\r\naspect. . . . The size-dials showed us to be near unit 50,000,000.\r\nFifty million times our original size! The vehicle 500,000 miles high!\r\n\r\n\"The relative Time-dials--showing relative earth-Time--were whirling.\r\nOur Time in the vehicle was less than a single second to a year on\r\nearth. My mind leaped back to you. Every second we lived there in the\r\nvehicle you here on earth were living more than a year. A century\r\nof yours was little more than a minute to us. The earth's future,\r\nwhirling on a thousand years while Martt and I sat there confused at\r\nthe instrument table. A tiny little earth, spinning like a top upon its\r\naxis, flashing around its tiny sun with a complete revolution every\r\nsecond!\r\n\r\n\"The velocity indicators, as well, were in rapid motion. The indicator\r\nof the miles-per-hour unit was an indistinguishable blur. And miles\r\nper minute--and per second--we could read none of them, so fast\r\nwere they moving. The light-year distance pointers were in motion.\r\nWe were piling up light-years of distance every moment. The total\r\nstood--as momentarily I read it--at between eleven and twelve thousand\r\nlight-years of total distance traveled. Light, speeding at 186,000\r\nmiles a second, must go a year to make a light-year unit of distance.\r\nAnd we had gone nearly 12,000 light-years! I read our present velocity\r\non the light-year velocity-dial. It was 3480 light-years per hour! And\r\nstill rapidly accelerating!\r\n\r\n\"The panic of fear possessed us at the strangeness of it all--at that\r\nvoid of blackness--soundlessness--into which we were plunging; and\r\neven our plunge unmarked by the faintest trembling of the vehicle. A\r\npanic. I started to use the aurometer to search for your ray. Absurd!\r\nThe absurdity of it made me laugh hysterically. Your ray had been\r\nextinguished thousands of years in my Past. I tried the myrdoscope--to\r\nlocate the image of the girl--to verify our direction, for abruptly\r\nI realized I had, in that empty black void, nothing by which I might\r\nlocate our position.\r\n\r\n\"The myrdoscope was inoperative! I could not locate the girl-image--nor\r\nanything else. I tried with the electro-telescope at its greatest\r\npower--tried frantically to pick up some star-image behind us. I could\r\nnot. I did not think they were as yet beyond its range--it merely\r\nhad gone dead. The current in it would not hum. It was dead like the\r\nmyrdoscope. We wondered then if our dials were working accurately. In\r\nour panic we doubted everything. And knew, with a stark terror upon\r\nus--knew that we were lost. Lost perhaps in Size and Time. And lost in\r\nblack Space, empty, soundless, unfathomable!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 7_\r\n\r\n                 \"A SINGLE STARLIT NIGHT--AN ETERNITY\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBrett had momentarily paused in his narrative, but when we would have\r\nplied him with questions he waved us aside.\r\n\r\n\"Let us finish first. The panic that was upon us with this\r\nknowledge--belief--that we were lost out there in Time and Size and\r\nSpace did not last long, for we fought against it. And presently we\r\nwere calmer--able to reason. Our size-dials were at rest--we had shut\r\noff the switch. By earth standards the vehicle was 500,000 miles in\r\nheight. Our relative Time was a century of yours, to a little more\r\nthan a minute of ours. Some 8,000 years into your earth-future had\r\nalready piled up on the earth standard Time-dial--and we were adding\r\none hundred years to it almost every minute. Our velocity had reached\r\na maximum of 3480 light-years per hour--and we were 12,000 light-years\r\nfrom earth. The velocity was now lessening a trifle; it dropped nearly\r\nto an even 3,000. With unchanging size now, with nothing near us to\r\nrepel or attract, the ether-friction overcame inertia to reach a\r\nbalance of forces.\r\n\r\n\"We conquered our fear--began to reason what we should do. It was of\r\ncourse futile to look for your aural ray. It had been extinguished\r\nthousands of years. We wanted to go on to our destination, and it was\r\nthe non-operation of the myrdoscope which worried and puzzled us. . . .\r\nI was sure, Father, that up to this point in the voyage I had made\r\nno serious error of direction. The image of the girl should have been\r\nbefore us. But the myrdoscope would not work.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Time----\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, no, Frank! We had progressed very little into the Time of that\r\ngirl's life. She should still have been reclining there on the bank; or\r\nat least the bank itself should have been there. We puzzled over what\r\ncould be the trouble with the myrdoscope. We found the trouble----\"\r\n\r\n\"I found it,\" said Martt eagerly.\r\n\r\nBrett nodded. \"Yes, it was Martt who reasoned it out. A curious\r\nexplanation--and one, I think, which involves the greatest of all the\r\nissues we had encountered. The myrdoscope would not operate for a very\r\nbig, but very simple reason. You would think to find the answer in\r\nScience? Not so. It was a theosophical reason, Father.\"\r\n\r\nBrett was very earnest, and very solemn. \"It was my purpose, you\r\nunderstand, to reach the girl at the _exact moment_ we had always seen\r\nher. We planned to make our Time before reaching her, coincident with\r\nhers of that given instant. Remember that. Consider then: At this other\r\ninstant when now we were trying to see her through the myrdoscope, our\r\nTime-rate had carried us about 8,000 years into earth's future. But\r\nalso, it had carried us some forty minutes into the girl's future.\r\n\r\n\"Not science now. Metaphysics, perhaps--and certainly Theology, and\r\nTheosophy. We were destined _to be with the girl during those forty\r\nminutes_. And we could not now look ahead and _see ourselves_--see our\r\nfuture actions.\r\n\r\n\"Father, you've spoken of that. What you said was true. It is not God's\r\nway that man should look at his own little future. Not best for us.\r\nThe Almighty knows it, and has prohibited it. Chaos would result, for\r\nwe live upon hope. There was no scientific reason why the myrdoscope\r\nshould not show us what we were destined to do during those forty\r\nminutes. Yet--it was dead. Dark. Inoperative.\r\n\r\n\"And this now I know: With all the science in the world there are some\r\nthings you can not do--those things which transgress the Creator's\r\nlaws. Before them--against all scientific reason, logic--we must fail.\r\nYou can not see your future; you can only live it once. Nor can you go\r\nback through Time to stop in your own Past; to live again your life--to\r\ndo differently than you did before. It is unthinkable--impossible, even\r\nthough now we have the scientific means to accomplish it. It is not the\r\nAlmighty's plan--and He will not let us do it.\r\n\r\n\"We reasoned all this out. It was simple enough. We had our Time-switch\r\nwhich would change our Time-rate irrespective of the normal Time-change\r\ninherent to our size. . . . That was what puzzled you awhile ago,\r\nFrank? Well, now we used that Time-change mechanism.\r\n\r\n\"It brought us new sensations. A shock, a queer humming lightness\r\npervading the vehicle, the air, our own bodies. A lightness as though\r\nalmost we were mere shadows of our former selves. Specters, a ghostly\r\nvehicle, humming with an infinite vibration.\r\n\r\n\"Presently that all wore away; or at least we grew used to it--so\r\nthat had there been anything in Space to see, as very soon there was,\r\nourselves were the substance--all else the shadows.\r\n\r\n\"We went backward very slightly in Time. I suppose some forty minutes\r\nof the girl's Time. I tested it by the myrdoscope. The instrument\r\nflashed on! It was operating! A continuous _retrograde_ action of the\r\nTime-mechanism was necessary to hold us upon that single given instant\r\nof the girl's existence. The calculation was intricate; I reached it,\r\npartly by mathematics, partly by experimentation with the myrdoscope.\r\nI saw fragments of the girl's immediate Past, as our Time-change swung\r\nus into it. Saw her arrive alone in the woodland dell. Saw her lie\r\ndown, at ease, with a security unsuspecting; saw the grinning, vicious\r\nlittle gnomes creep upon her; the leering giant appear. And made, then,\r\nanother startling discovery--I'll tell you about it in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"At last I had the Time-change correctly gaged; we were--in relation\r\nto the girl--standing still in Time. Presently we again increased our\r\nsize. An alteration of the Time-mechanism was needed; a progressive\r\nalteration. But this was simple to calculate and to adjust.\"\r\n\r\nFrannie asked, \"What was your discovery?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \"Curious as always, little sister? It was that the giant was\r\nin the act of becoming _smaller_! The gnomes were growing in size!\" He\r\nchecked our chorus of exclamations.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you now: This giant--these gnomes--were three beings who\r\ndid not belong to the girl's world. They had come there from a greater\r\nworld outside the atom. By means of science--such means possibly as we\r\nnow were using with the vehicle--they had diminished their stature to\r\nthe infinitely small. Had gone down and down into their tiny atom, to\r\ncome upon the girl and her realm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nAgain Brett waved us aside. \"Not now, please! Oh, yes--I can tell you\r\nthe structure of this, our little fragment of the material universe!\r\nBut let me finish first about our voyage.\r\n\r\n\"With our Time-change corrected, the myrdoscope readily had picked up\r\nthe image of the girl. A larger image, for we were 12,000 light-years\r\ncloser to her. The same scene, stricken again of motion. The giant\r\nstanding there; the gnome climbing upon the girl's ankle; and herself,\r\njust aware of her danger, with dawning terror on her face.\r\n\r\n\"The electro-telescope also was working now. Looking behind us, we\r\ncould just see the last of the stars. And soon they were gone. A day of\r\nour conscious existence went by. At 3,000 light-years an hour we added\r\n72,000 light-years of distance--a total from earth of about 84,000. The\r\nblack abyss of Space had not remained empty. Off to one side had been\r\na faint glow. A nebula; a patch of star-dust. Through the telescope we\r\ncould see stars--a complete starry universe. It was as large, no doubt,\r\nas that we had passed through.\r\n\r\n\"It gave us a new idea of the immensity of Space. Separated by some\r\n30,000 light-years from our own universe of stars--of which the Solar\r\nSystem is so tiny a part--this other star-patch was equally as large.\r\nAnd yet it seemed to lie isolated in fathomless Space. It drifted by\r\nus and in a few hours was gone. And far off to the other side of us,\r\nanother patch came past. And others; each several thousand light-years\r\nin extent; each isolated from all its fellows.\r\n\r\n\"We traveled another full day. Over 150,000 light-years from earth. Yet\r\nthe girl's image was seemingly not coming nearer very rapidly. We felt\r\nthe voyage would take too long, so again we increased our size.\"\r\n\r\nI interrupted. \"Had you calculated the girl's relative size?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"In a moment, Frank, you shall have it. We--our\r\nvehicle--was 500,000 miles high, compared to earth. We increased\r\nit to 600,000. Our velocity also increased. At a million miles of\r\nheight--I have made all my stated figures round numbers, but they\r\nare approximately correct--at this million-mile height, we reached\r\nnormality to the girl. It simplified our mechanism adjustments. There\r\nwas no longer a size-change necessary. A retrograde Time-change, equal\r\nto our own now normal rate of existence, held us at that same instant\r\nof her life.\r\n\r\n\"Our velocity was more than proportionately increased. To demonstrate\r\nthat mathematically would be intricate--would involve several very\r\ncomplicated formulas, which would not interest you now. . . We passed,\r\ndistantly, a score or more of starry universes--to the sides, and\r\nabove and below us--lying in every plane; and of every size and\r\ngeneral extent. Some were small, a few thousand light-years like our\r\nown. Others immense; one which seemed 500,000 light-years at least in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n\"We reached ultimately a maximum velocity of about 90,000 light-years\r\nan hour. We had previously gone 150,000 light-years from earth. We\r\ntraveled some eighty additional hours, not all at the maximum--for\r\npossibly half that time we were steadily accelerating. And at a total\r\nof 4,750,000 light-years from the earth, a faint glow of seeming\r\nphosphorescence showed in the blackness beneath us.\r\n\r\n\"There was a universe to one side, ahead of us. But this was a\r\ndifferent light. A radiation from the Inner Surface itself. The Inner\r\nSurface of the hollow little atom within which all this Space and its\r\ninfinitesimal whirling electrons is contained. They are immense suns,\r\nto us here on earth, but from the larger viewpoint they were mere\r\nelectrons, whirling, flashing around in tiny orbits a thousand times a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n\"The girl and her realm, as we had thought, are on this Inner Surface\r\nof what we may choose to call an atom. Themselves--this girl and her\r\npeople--are infinitesimal. This atom of ours is merely some tiny\r\nparticle of matter in that other world from which the giant and the\r\ngnomes had descended. A tiny particle of matter. Call it a grain\r\nof sand, lying with trillions of its fellows upon some great ocean\r\nbeach--lying there in the light of stars shining in infinite Space\r\nabove it. Lying there for a single starlit night which is all eternity\r\nfor us. A single starlit night--an eternity! Infinity, of Space and\r\nTime? Why, even now I have seen no more than an infinitesimal fragment\r\nof them! . . . .\r\n\r\n\"The giant and gnomes were doubtless normally of the same size--only\r\nmomentarily did they happen to be different. . . . Wait, Frannie,\r\nplease! I can't tell it to you any faster. . . . The Inner Surface\r\nbecame visible to our telescopes at about 4,900,000 light-years. A\r\nrealm of land and water. Vegetation. Strange of aspect, yet normal too.\r\nIt stretched beneath us in every direction--a huge concave surface.\r\n\r\n\"We kept our size, but using the repellent force of this Inner Surface,\r\nI gradually cut down our velocity. Down more and more until that last\r\nlight-year or so took us a week to traverse. The girl, Father, is\r\napproximately 5,000,000 light-years from here. We--our earth--may be\r\nnear the center of the void. I don't know. Perhaps we are much nearer\r\nthe girl's side. It isn't important . . .\r\n\r\n\"The Inner Surface at last lay close beneath us. It took us an\r\nadditional week of diminishing velocity to reach its atmosphere. I was\r\ncautious; I had the velocity under control always.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, seeming carefully to consider his next words. \"I\r\nwant you now to forget earth standards. Take the larger viewpoint\r\nexclusively. Let me speak of miles, not in relation to earth, but\r\nmiles--in relation to the Inner Surface--which are 100 million times\r\nlonger. Let me speak then of myself as again but six feet high; the\r\nvehicle, 52.8 feet high. Realize that by the larger standards I was but\r\none-twentieth of a light-year from earth.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gryce said gravely, \"Your telescope would show a globe like the\r\nearth very plainly at one-twentieth of a light-year of distance. You\r\nmust explain, Brett, why you could not see it--or any of the great\r\nstars of our immediate universe.\"\r\n\r\nBrett nodded. \"We could not see the earth, because to our size it was\r\nmerely a little orange. To be more exact, a ball about five inches in\r\ndiameter. A tiny ball I could have held in my hand, whirling out there\r\nin Space, spinning like a top on its axis to make your infinitesimal\r\ndays and nights; traversing its entire orbit--a complete revolution\r\naround its little sun--more than three times every second!\r\n\r\n\"With these other standards, then, I want you to visualize us as we sat\r\non the floor of the vehicle gazing down through the lower window. We\r\nwere, say a hundred miles above the Inner Surface, just entering the\r\nupper strata of its atmosphere, and falling gently downward. Beneath\r\nus lay a broad vista of land and water; vegetation; forests; here and\r\nthere patches of human habitation--houses, villages. It was a strange,\r\nunfamiliar landscape, yet not unduly abnormal. In every direction--as\r\nwe dropped closer--it spread upward to our horizon. A rolling country;\r\ngently undulating hills, broad valleys--and off near the horizon a\r\njagged mountain range. It seemed not far away; we could see black\r\nyawning holes in it; the mouths of caves, or tunnels, perhaps.\r\n\r\n\"The broad crescent lake lay directly beneath us. Trees bordered its\r\nbanks; trees strange of shape--yet one would call them trees at once.\r\nA collection of low, flat-roofed buildings lay beside the water. A\r\nvillage--or a city. The buildings were queerly curved--seemingly\r\ncrescent-shaped. They had no straight lines. They seemed generally of\r\nbut one story, though a few were larger; and upon an eminence near the\r\nwater stood one much larger; more ornate of shape than all the others.\r\n\r\n\"It was not a fantastic scene, but wholly rational to our own accepted\r\nstandards. A sylvan atmosphere seemed to hang upon it. Trees and\r\nflowers were everywhere; the roof-tops seemed gardens as luxuriant as\r\nthose beside the houses. The streets were broad and orderly; and beyond\r\nthe city ribbons of roads wound out over the hills.\r\n\r\n\"A sylvan landscape, with an air of quiet peace upon it. I felt a sense\r\nof surprize. This was not modernity; nor a civilization more advanced\r\nthan our own--nor yet was it barbarism. Later I knew it was decadence.\r\nA people who once had been far up the slope of civilization, over the\r\npeak, and now were coming down upon the other side. The peaceful,\r\nrestful ease of decadence, which to complete the inevitable cycle of\r\nall human life ultimately would again bring them to barbarism.\r\n\r\n\"We saw these details as we fell gently toward the crescent lake. You\r\nwill notice I have not mentioned color in the scheme, nor movement.\r\nOur Time-mechanism was operating. The scene beneath us was stricken\r\nmotionless, since always we were holding to the same instant of its\r\nTime. An unreality lay upon it; a flat, shadowy grayness of aspect. An\r\nunnatural stillness. We dropped closer. A shadowy boat seemed on the\r\nlake--a boat with a sail. It lay there, immobile. The water was rippled\r\nby a breeze; but they were frozen ripples. And in the streets now we\r\nsaw people and curious vehicles--all standing like waxen figures.\r\n\r\n\"The grove of trees--the woodland dell wherein the girl was lying--was\r\na short distance down the lake shore from the city. A single house was\r\nnear it; but in the other direction was unbroken forest. An open space\r\nwas there--a few hundred feet from the girl and her assailants. We\r\ndecided to land there. We knew we were invisible as yet--a ghost of a\r\nvehicle, all in this same instant coming from Space to land upon the\r\nlake shore.\r\n\r\n\"We had not yet decided just what we would do. But it was necessary to\r\nland first. And necessary also for the vehicle to assume the Time-rate\r\nof this realm before we could leave it. When that was done we would be\r\nnormal humans, to rescue the girl as best we might.\r\n\r\n\"We dropped into the little clearing at the edge of the lake, and\r\ngently came to rest--and upon the surface of the ground, since to us\r\nit would have had no substance; but within a foot of it, where, like a\r\nghost hovering, I held us level. The unreality of us, I must repeat,\r\nwas not to us apparent; we seemed solid--it was the ground, the forest\r\nabout us which was unreal. Spectral trees; a gray twilight. I made\r\nsure that nothing was touching us. We were a few inches only above a\r\nsoft-looking gray ground. We were ready to cut off our Time-change--to\r\ntake our places normal to this new realm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 8_\r\n\r\n                   THE ENCOUNTER IN THE FOREST GLADE\r\n\r\n\r\nMartt said, \"I would have thrown off the Time-switch and rushed out at\r\nonce. But Brett wanted to talk about it.\"\r\n\r\nBrett smiled. \"It was difficult for us to remember that no haste was\r\nneeded. No haste--until we took the girl's Time-rate. And then we\r\nwould need all haste possible. We discussed what we were to do. We had\r\nweapons--the electronic flash, for instance, with which we could have\r\nstruck down that giant as with a lightning bolt. But could we? I was\r\nnot sure--not absolutely sure--that the weapon would be operative. Or\r\nthat, perchance, this giant would not by some strange means be proof\r\nagainst it. A man sixty feet tall is no mean adversary. Suppose he held\r\nthe girl before him? Would I dare attack?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suggested,\" Martt put in, \"that we take the normal Time-rate of the\r\ngirl, and be in hiding until the giant's size had dwindled to hers. The\r\ndwarfs were growing. But there would only be three of them, against two\r\nof us--and so far as we had seen, they were not armed.\"\r\n\r\nBrett went on: \"That didn't seem a good plan. The giant's size was, we\r\nhad calculated, rapidly dwindling. Within five minutes he would be the\r\ngirl's size. But suppose, instead of standing there during those five\r\nminutes he picked up the girl--made off with her? It was too dangerous.\r\n\r\n\"At last we decided to make the vehicle, and thus ourselves, somewhat\r\nlarger. At the risk seriously of frightening the girl, we decided to\r\ntake a stature larger than the giant. Thus, since he was not armed, we\r\nwould have little difficulty keeping the girl from harm.\r\n\r\n\"The forest glade within which our vehicle was hovering was ample for\r\nthe growth. We adjusted the mechanisms; and in a few moments of growth\r\nwe had reached the determined point. We shut off the switches; the\r\nvehicle fell its few inches to the ground. . . .\r\n\r\n\"The scene clarified. We were in a somber forest of dull,\r\norange-colored vegetation. Above us was a deep purple sky, with a few\r\ndrifting clouds, and stars gleaming up there in the darkness. They were\r\nthe stars of that last universe we had passed; unnatural of aspect, for\r\nthey seemed unduly close and unduly small.\r\n\r\n\"It was not day--nor yet was it night. A queerly shimmering twilight;\r\nshadowless, for the light seemed inherent to everything.\r\n\r\n\"We were aware of all this in an instant, but we did not stop to regard\r\nit, for Time now was passing. The girl and her assailants were now,\r\nwe knew, in full motion. With the flash cylinders in hand we stepped\r\nhastily from the vehicle doorway.\r\n\r\n\"The forest trees were saplings no higher than ourselves. We plunged\r\nthrough them, came to the other glade. The girl was sitting up with\r\nhands pressed to her breast in terror--a tiny figure of a girl not as\r\nlong as my hand. The dwarfs were so small I did not see them at first;\r\nthey were standing beside her--an inch perhaps in height. The giant,\r\nwith what drug acting upon him we could only guess, had dwindled until\r\nhe was only about half our own present height. He had dropped his\r\ntree-bludgeon, which now was too large for him, and was stooping down\r\nto seize the girl. His leer, with the reality of motion upon it, was\r\nhorrible.\r\n\r\n\"Momentarily we had stopped at the edge of the glade. The figures\r\nthere were aware of us. The girl screamed--a little voice, shrill with\r\nterror, an agony of sudden fear--at her assailants, and doubtless most\r\nof all at ourselves. The giant--I can no longer call him that, since\r\nwe saw him as no more than three feet tall--at our appearance he\r\nstraightened. Stared at us. Surprize, then fear swept his ugly hairy\r\nface. He shouted something to his tiny companions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The girl screamed--a little voice, shrill with terror,\r\nan agony of sudden fear.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Martt's hand went up; he fired his cylinder. But he was confused--and\r\nthe nearness of the girl to his mark made him aim high. The bolt\r\nmissed; lodged harmlessly in a tree with a ripping of its bark. I\r\nrushed forward to seize our adversary, but he eluded me, leaped over\r\nthe girl. I was afraid of trampling her--I stepped backward--clutched\r\nMartt, fearful of what he might do.\r\n\r\n\"It had all happened in a moment. The dwarfs had vanished; but the\r\nother man--he was now no higher than my knees--was standing by a tree\r\nbehind the girl. He shouted again; and now the terror had left his\r\nface and he was grinning, I saw his hand go swiftly to his mouth. Had\r\nhe taken more of his strange drug? Had he warned his two companions to\r\ndo the same? I think so, for before my eyes he was swiftly diminishing\r\nin size. I knelt carefully beside the girl. Her figure--smaller than\r\nmy foot and near it--was huddled into a little ball, her head against\r\nher upraised knees. She may have fainted; I did not heed her, save to\r\nbe careful my movements did not strike her. With arm stretched over\r\nher I reached for the man. But he hopped away and eluded me. Still\r\ngrinning. As small now as my little finger he stood half hiding behind\r\na grass-blade. On hands and knees I pursued him. But like an insect, he\r\nwas too quick for me. Smaller always until I was probing the grass with\r\nmy fingers to find him--saw him momentarily like an ant in size as he\r\nleaped into a tangle of tiny grass-blades and was gone.\r\n\r\n\"I had forgotten my weapon. Illogically I had had no desire to kill\r\nthat tiny figure--only to catch it. But Martt had had no such feelings.\r\nHe was stamping around the glade--trying to stamp upon the other\r\nfigures--and mumbling angrily to himself. I called to ask if he had\r\ncaught them. He didn't know. He had seen them momentarily--seen them\r\nraise their hands to their mouths. But they had dwindled so fast, they\r\nwere lost in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"The girl was unconscious, lying there in a huddled little heap. Gently\r\nI raised her, held her in the palm of my hand. She was white as a\r\nlittle waxen figure--white and beautiful; and so small I scarce dared\r\nto touch her with my huge rough fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Martt brought water from the lake. I rested my hand on the ground,\r\nwith her still lying in it. And then presently she opened her eyes.\"\r\n\r\nBrett paused, and as he gazed at each of us in turn I thought I had\r\nnever seen his face so earnest. And there was upon it, too, a look\r\nalmost of exaltation--a look which transfigured it. He added gently:\r\n\"You three--my father, my sister, my friend, I have no need to hide\r\nfrom you my emotions. I think then--incongruously perhaps, for that\r\nlittle figure of girlhood lying there so soft and warm in the palm of\r\nmy hand--I think then my love for her was born.\"\r\n\r\nHide his emotions! He could not had he wished. This love in his\r\nheart was written plain on his face, to soften it, to uplift it to\r\nsomething--or so it seemed to me--something just a little more than\r\nhuman. A touch, perchance, of divinity. And I think now that love does\r\nthat--if only for some fleeting moment--to each one of us.\r\n\r\nHe went on very softly: \"She opened her eyes. I was afraid she would\r\nbe frightened. I tried to look very gentle, compassionate. I held\r\nmy hand very still. I think that for an instant Martt and I stopped\r\nbreathing. . . She opened her eyes--met mine. I saw in hers a flash\r\nof terror. But something, strangely, must have conquered it--against\r\nall reason as she stared at me. Stared while the terror faded, and her\r\nlittle lips parted and smiled a welcome and a thanks. . .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 9_\r\n\r\n            \"DWINDLING GIANTS FROM LARGENESS UNFATHOMABLE\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was not one of us who would have interrupted Brett when he paused\r\nto light an arrant-cylinder and to choose what next he would tell us.\r\nHe was speaking softly, reminiscently, and with a curious gentleness.\r\n\r\n\"I carried her to the vehicle, showed it to her. Obviously she could\r\nunderstand nothing of my words; but she was very quick to read my\r\ngestures; smiling readily now, with her fear quite gone. And sitting\r\nup in the palm of my hand, with her arm flung about my thumb to steady\r\nher, she bade me raise her to my ear. Her words--the softest, the\r\ntiniest of human voices--what she said was wholly unintelligible, save\r\nthat I understood her name was Leela.\r\n\r\n\"She stood beside a tree at a distance while we re-entered the vehicle\r\nand brought it down to a size normal to her; and came out of it to\r\nconfront her.\"\r\n\r\nMartt burst out: \"I tell you that was when I realized how beautiful she\r\nis. Say, you never saw a girl like her--you can't describe it----\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not trying,\" said Brett with his gentle smile. \"She met us--there\r\nby the vehicle--to us then, Frannie, she was about your size--perhaps\r\na little smaller. She took our hands, laid them against her forehead\r\nas though with a gesture of welcome. And led us presently to her\r\nhome--the house near by. Her father (her mother is dead) her father is\r\na musician. Noted--very high of rank and standing among his people. A\r\nkindly old man, with gray and black hair worn long to the base of his\r\nneck. We--Martt and I--didn't let ours grow, though as you see we took\r\ntheir mode of dress.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long were you there?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"We slept perhaps three hundred times,\" he answered. \"There are no\r\ndays and nights--always that same half-luminous twilight. No change\r\nof seasons--or very little. It is nature in her softest mood. Nothing\r\nto struggle against--life made easy. Too easy. . . It was not we who\r\nlearned Leela's language, but she, like an unnatural precocious child,\r\nwho learned ours. . . We created a commotion among the people; the\r\nruler sent for us. . . Oh, I have so much I'd like to tell you. But\r\nMartt can tell it--after----\"\r\n\r\nHe checked himself suddenly. His words, some vague hint of what he\r\nalmost had added, sent an ominous chill to my heart; and I saw, too,\r\nthat Dr. Gryce had felt it, for a cloud came to his face and in his\r\neyes I saw fear lurking.\r\n\r\nBut Brett went on at once: \"I'd like to tell you of these people. A\r\nrace at peace with nature and themselves. The struggle for existence\r\nall in the past. Decadence. The down-hill grade. Only by struggle can\r\nMan progress, Father. This race, with the peak of its civilization\r\nthousands of generations in its Past, gently resting, with the\r\ninevitable decadence drawing it inexorably back to the barbarism\r\nfrom whence it sprung. I'd like to tell you of their customs, their\r\ngovernment--their mode of life. . . Some other time--or Martt will\r\ntell you. . . It was all so beautiful--so romantic. . . Music--their\r\nstrange, beautiful arts--Music as Leela's father gave it--Art to take\r\nthe place of Science and Industry. . . You ask Martt to tell you about\r\nthe dancing--the pageants, if you want to call them that, to which we\r\nwent so many times with Leela. . . But just now I'm tired--I think I've\r\ntalked too much--and I'm worried--and it seems to press me, against\r\nall the logic of our Science, that I have no time to spend, telling all\r\nthis to you. . .\"\r\n\r\nBrett, indeed, seemed suddenly tired, or perhaps harassed at the\r\nthoughts which had come to him. I had been so absorbed--as had all of\r\nus--that we had given no heed to the passing hours. Abruptly I realized\r\nthat the room was chill with early morning; through the window I saw\r\nthe flush of the eastern sky.\r\n\r\nMartt followed my glance. \"Why, it's dawn! Brett's been talking all\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nBrett said strangely: \"Too long! Father, this gentle race living out\r\nthere in such seeming security had just been visited by beings from\r\nthe great world outside it. A world known to them only by legend of\r\ntheir past ages which they scarce knew to be true or false. Those three\r\nassailants of Leela's--and other men like them--had suddenly appeared\r\nas dwindling giants coming down out of largeness unfathomable. They had\r\nalready destroyed a city. . .\"\r\n\r\nBrett's voice had risen; he was talking faster now; and there was\r\na touch of wildness in his tone--a wildness perhaps born of his\r\nexhaustion, and the emotional stress under which I knew now he had been\r\nlaboring all night.\r\n\r\n\"Our arrival there, Father--the three assailants of Leela--I think the\r\nlarger, him whom we have called the 'giant'--I think he is leader of\r\nthe invaders from that greater world. Our appearance--our own power to\r\nchange size which perhaps he observed there in the forest--must have\r\nfrightened him. The invaders vanished. But at the end of those months\r\nwe lived there--another of these giants was seen.\r\n\r\n\"They're coming back again--to threaten Leela and all her people! I\r\ncame here to see you, Father--to tell you all I've told--and to leave\r\nMartt. But I'm going back--to do what I can against this threat--this\r\ninvasion. And I want to go back to Leela. She----\"\r\n\r\n\"She was afraid to come with us,\" Martt put in. \"I wanted her to\r\ncome--and now I want to go back with Brett. We've been arguing about it\r\nfor days--he won't let me go back with him--he's stubborn----\"\r\n\r\nBrett reiterated: \"I'm going back. I'm going alone. As soon as I've\r\nslept--I've got to sleep now--you, you'll excuse me--let me take a\r\ngood long sleep--I'm too tired to argue about it now. . . Good night,\r\nFrannie, dear--good night, Father--good night, Frank.\"\r\n\r\nHe was presently gone from the room. Dr. Gryce had been sitting beside\r\nme and I put my hand on his arm. His face was quite colorless; his\r\nvoice, suddenly very old and helpless, was murmuring, \"I don't want him\r\nto go out there again. I'm afraid--and I don't want him to do it. . .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _CHAPTER 10_\r\n\r\n                         THE SOLITARY VOYAGER\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But Brett,\" I said, \"there are one or two things I want to ask you.\r\nAbout your return voyage--for instance----\"\r\n\r\nIt was mid-afternoon. Brett, thoroughly rested, was wholly himself\r\nagain. Quiet, composed and smiling, but very determined; even a little\r\ngrim. And I think he was a bit ashamed of the sudden, almost querulous\r\nway in which he had terminated his narrative and left us there in the\r\nobservation room at dawn. He had had his sleep now; and had been alone\r\nfor an hour with his father. Martt and Frannie had been called to them;\r\nI--an outsider--was not asked, or wanted. What took place there behind\r\nthe closed door of the study, it was not for me to ask. But when they\r\ncame out I knew that Brett had won. A questionable victory, for old Dr.\r\nGryce was visibly broken; Frannie--pale and upon the verge of tears;\r\nand Martt for a time a trifle sullen; resentful that he was to be left\r\nbehind. I think it hurt Brett--this fear he was bringing upon those\r\nhe loved. But he was very determined; convinced that it was the right\r\nthing for him to do.\r\n\r\n\"I start back tonight, Frank,\" he told me soberly as he emerged from\r\nthe study.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" I said. \"For how long will you be gone this time?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. A look, which even now my memory fails to interpret,\r\ncame to him. Then he smiled. \"I don't know. But remember, Frank, I can\r\nreturn--with only those limitations the Almighty enforces--I can return\r\nto any point of earth-Time I wish. As you will live it--well, I shall\r\naim to return here within a month.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then I asked him about the return voyage he and Martt had just\r\nmade. \"Brett, I've been wondering--did our aural ray guide you back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"On the voyage back, the first thing I did was to put\r\nthe vehicle back through Time to a chosen instant at which I wished\r\nto arrive here on earth. When that was done, I held that instant\r\nalways. We could not see the aural ray going out--when we looked\r\nback for it--for two reasons. One: Our Time had run far into earth's\r\nFuture, and the ray was non-existent. The other: Even had we taken the\r\nproper Time-point, we were outrunning the light-rays themselves. In\r\nspace, I mean, the aural ray left earth only with the speed of light.\r\nOur velocity exceeded that. You see? But on the return voyage we\r\nencountered the ray as we came in. A mere flash over the sky; but its\r\ncharacteristic color-bands guided us.\"\r\n\r\nWhat he said about outrunning the light-rays made me think of the\r\nmyrdoscope, the image of that girl--which they had received here on\r\nearth before the voyage--that image had crossed a space 5,000,000\r\nlight-years in extent. But when I mentioned it, he explained:\r\n\r\n\"The myrdal rays are not light, Frank, but only akin to it. Their\r\nvelocity--why, light beside them is a laggard. We have no way of\r\ncomputing the velocity of the myrdal rays. But over a finite distance\r\nsuch as five million light-years--for practical purposes it is\r\ninstantaneous. . .\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to tell you--I was confused last night--I meant to explain\r\nthat coming back I used quite a different method from the outward trip.\r\nI chanced a disturbance of some of those outlying starry universes,\r\nand when we left the Inner Surface, I made the vehicle larger instead\r\nof smaller. The void of Space shrank until about us the universes were\r\nclustered like little patches of mist--tiny areas of glowing star-dust.\r\nI saw our own, with its spectrum of the aural ray, quite readily. And\r\nhad reached it with a voyage of a few hours--and then reduced our size.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your Time,\" I said. \"Brett, I didn't see the vehicle until it was\r\nalmost entering the earth's atmosphere. And--just for an instant--it\r\nseemed not solid, but like a vague gray ghost. Then suddenly it\r\nmaterialized.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled and nodded. \"Yes. That was when I took the earth's normal\r\nTime-rate.\"\r\n\r\nThe family joined us; we said no more. And that night Brett left us\r\nfor his solitary voyage. I would not set down here in detail those\r\nlast good-byes. Emotion repressed--it was what was not said that held\r\na pathos I shall never forget. An outward attempt at lightness. Martt\r\nlaughed, \"Give my love to Leela.\" And Frannie said, \"You tell her I'm\r\njealous because she's so beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nJust before Brett closed the door of the vehicle, Dr. Gryce spoke--the\r\nonly thing he had said for an hour past.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be sure to come back, Brett? Within the month, lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. Yes, Father dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--good-bye. . .\"\r\n\r\nGood-bye! I can think of no sadder word for human tongue to frame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _CHAPTER 11_\r\n\r\n            BRAVE LITTLE BEACON STRIVING TO PIERCE INFINITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThat little month of anxious watching and waiting passed so slowly! And\r\nyet so quickly, as one by one its golden moments of hope drained away.\r\n\r\nBrett did not return. A month, then a year, while Dr. Gryce made me\r\nleave the Service, to enter his, that all my time might be spent in\r\nwatching.\r\n\r\nA year; and now another year has passed. Brett would return within the\r\nmonth. With his Time-mechanism unimpaired, no delay out there in the\r\nBeyond could have affected his return to reach us during that first\r\nlittle month. With that passed and gone, reason could only show the\r\nfutility of expecting him ever. Yet reason plays so small a part, when\r\nit would seek to kill hope.\r\n\r\nThe aural ray still burns--brave little beacon striving to pierce\r\ninfinity. Beside it, for those long, unreasoning hours of vigil, Dr.\r\nGryce sits and waits; silent, grayer and every day visibly older. The\r\npossibilities of what could have happened to Brett--that myriad of\r\nfutile human conjectures--we have long since ceased voicing. Alone, I\r\nsometimes speculate. Has Brett gone on into that outside world of which\r\nwe all are only a tiny atom? What is he doing? And then I tell myself,\r\nwhat is it to me, save that it concerns Brett? The myriad, unfathomable\r\nhappenings of Eternal Time in Infinite Space--what right have I, one\r\ntiny mortal, to probe them?\r\n\r\nThe beacon burns to guide Brett back to us. Will he ever come? I\r\nwonder. My brain, with its logic, says he will not. But my heart says,\r\n\"Might he not come tonight?\" Or with tonight passed, then tomorrow\r\nhe will be here. Thus hope runs on and on, daunted but never broken.\r\nBlessed hope, to make possible a courageous living of this little\r\nlife until we ourselves are plunged into that glowing Infinity of the\r\nHereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END",
