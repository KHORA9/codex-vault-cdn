NEILL\r\n\r\n\r\n    This Book is Dedicated to\r\n\r\n    My Son Robert Stanton Baum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO OUR READERS\r\n\r\n\r\nGlinda the Good, lovely Sorceress of the Land of Oz and friend of\r\nPrincess Ozma and Dorothy, has lots of personal acquaintances who want\r\nto know more about her. So, in the new Oz story, Mr. L. Frank Baum,\r\nRoyal Historian of Oz, has written a whole book about how Glinda and\r\nthe Wizard worked with all their might to save the Princess and\r\nDorothy from the dire dangers which threatened them when they went\r\namong the warring tribes of the Flatheads and Skeezers.\r\n\r\nThe wicked Queen Coo-ee-oh, a vain and evil witch, was really to blame\r\nfor all the trouble. She surely succeeded in getting every one on the\r\nmagic, glass-domed island of the Skeezers into amazing difficulties.\r\nWhen Mr. Baum tells you how worried everybody in the Land of Oz felt\r\nabout the Princess Ozma and Dorothy and what wonderful sorcery Glinda\r\nhad to perform to save them, you'll be thrilled with excitement and\r\nadmiration. He reveals the most hidden mysteries of magic.\r\n\r\nMr. Baum did his best to answer all the letters from his small\r\nearth-friends before he had to leave them, but he couldn't answer\r\nquite all, for there were very many. In May, nineteen hundred\r\nnineteen, he went away to take his stories to the little child-souls\r\nwho had lived here too long ago to read the Oz stories for themselves.\r\n\r\nWe are sorry he could not stay here and we are sad to tell you this is\r\nhis last complete story. But he left some unfinished notes about the\r\nPrincess Ozma and Dorothy and the Oz people and we promise that some\r\nday we will put them all together like a picture puzzle and give you\r\nmore stories of the wonderful Land of Oz.\r\n\r\n    Cordially, your friends,\r\n    The Publishers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    LIST OF CHAPTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n     1 The Call of Duty\r\n     2 Ozma and Dorothy\r\n     3 The Mist Maidens\r\n     4 The Magic Tent\r\n     5 The Magic Stairway\r\n     6 Flathead Mountain\r\n     7 The Magic Isle\r\n     8 Queen Coo-ee-oh\r\n     9 Lady Aurex\r\n    10 Under Water\r\n    11 The Conquest of the Skeezers\r\n    12 The Diamond Swan\r\n    13 The Alarm Bell\r\n    14 Ozma's Counsellors\r\n    15 The Great Sorceress\r\n    16 The Enchanted Fishes\r\n    17 Under the Great Dome\r\n    18 The Cleverness of Ervic\r\n    19 Red Reera, the Yookoohoo\r\n    20 A Puzzling Problem\r\n    21 The Three Adepts\r\n    22 The Sunken Island\r\n    23 The Magic Words\r\n    24 Glinda's Triumph\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Glinda of Oz]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1\r\n\r\nThe Call to Duty\r\n\r\n\r\nGlinda, the good Sorceress of Oz, sat in the grand court of her\r\npalace, surrounded by her maids of honor--a hundred of the most\r\nbeautiful girls of the Fairyland of Oz. The palace court was built of\r\nrare marbles, exquisitely polished. Fountains tinkled musically here\r\nand there; the vast colonnade, open to the south, allowed the maidens,\r\nas they raised their heads from their embroideries, to gaze upon a\r\nvista of rose-hued fields and groves of trees bearing fruits or laden\r\nwith sweet-scented flowers. At times one of the girls would start a\r\nsong, the others joining in the chorus, or one would rise and dance,\r\ngracefully swaying to the music of a harp played by a companion. And\r\nthen Glinda smiled, glad to see her maids mixing play with work.\r\n\r\nPresently among the fields an object was seen moving, threading the\r\nbroad path that led to the castle gate. Some of the girls looked upon\r\nthis object enviously; the Sorceress merely gave it a glance and\r\nnodded her stately head as if pleased, for it meant the coming of her\r\nfriend and mistress--the only one in all the land that Glinda bowed\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThen up the path trotted a wooden animal attached to a red wagon, and\r\nas the quaint steed halted at the gate there descended from the wagon\r\ntwo young girls, Ozma, Ruler of Oz, and her companion, Princess\r\nDorothy. Both were dressed in simple white muslin gowns, and as they\r\nran up the marble steps of the palace they laughed and chatted as\r\ngaily as if they were not the most important persons in the world's\r\nloveliest fairyland.\r\n\r\nThe maids of honor had risen and stood with bowed heads to greet the\r\nroyal Ozma, while Glinda came forward with outstretched arms to greet\r\nher guests.\r\n\r\n\"We've just come on a visit, you know,\" said Ozma. \"Both Dorothy and I\r\nwere wondering how we should pass the day when we happened to think\r\nwe'd not been to your Quadling Country for weeks, so we took the\r\nSawhorse and rode straight here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we came so fast,\" added Dorothy, \"that our hair is blown all\r\nfuzzy, for the Sawhorse makes a wind of his own. Usually it's a day's\r\njourney from the Em'rald City, but I don't s'pose we were two hours on\r\nthe way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are most welcome,\" said Glinda the Sorceress, and led them\r\nthrough the court to her magnificent reception hall. Ozma took the arm\r\nof her hostess, but Dorothy lagged behind, kissing some of the maids\r\nshe knew best, talking with others, and making them all feel that she\r\nwas their friend. When at last she joined Glinda and Ozma in the\r\nreception hall, she found them talking earnestly about the\r\ncondition of the people, and how to make them more happy and\r\ncontented--although they were already the happiest and most contented\r\nfolks in all the world.\r\n\r\nThis interested Ozma, of course, but it didn't interest Dorothy very\r\nmuch, so the little girl ran over to a big table on which was lying\r\nopen Glinda's Great Book of Records.\r\n\r\nThis Book is one of the greatest treasures in Oz, and the Sorceress\r\nprizes it more highly than any of her magical possessions. That is the\r\nreason it is firmly attached to the big marble table by means of\r\ngolden chains, and whenever Glinda leaves home she locks the Great\r\nBook together with five jeweled padlocks, and carries the keys safely\r\nhidden in her bosom.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose there is any magical thing in any fairyland to\r\ncompare with the Record Book, on the pages of which are constantly\r\nbeing printed a record of every event that happens in any part of the\r\nworld, at exactly the moment it happens. And the records are always\r\ntruthful, although sometimes they do not give as many details as one\r\ncould wish. But then, lots of things happen, and so the records have\r\nto be brief or even Glinda's Great Book could not hold them all.\r\n\r\nGlinda looked at the records several times each day, and Dorothy,\r\nwhenever she visited the Sorceress, loved to look in the Book and see\r\nwhat was happening everywhere. Not much was recorded about the Land of\r\nOz, which is usually peaceful and uneventful, but today Dorothy found\r\nsomething which interested her. Indeed, the printed letters were\r\nappearing on the page even while she looked.\r\n\r\n\"This is funny!\" she exclaimed. \"Did you know, Ozma, that there were\r\npeople in your Land of Oz called Skeezers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Ozma, coming to her side, \"I know that on Professor\r\nWogglebug's Map of the Land of Oz there is a place marked 'Skeezer,'\r\nbut what the Skeezers are like I do not know. No one I know has ever\r\nseen them or heard of them. The Skeezer Country is 'way at the upper\r\nedge of the Gillikin Country, with the sandy, impassable desert on one\r\nside and the mountains of Oogaboo on another side. That is a part of\r\nthe Land of Oz of which I know very little.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess no one else knows much about it either, unless it's the\r\nSkeezers themselves,\" remarked Dorothy. \"But the Book says: 'The\r\nSkeezers of Oz have declared war on the Flatheads of Oz, and there is\r\nlikely to be fighting and much trouble as the result.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all the Book says?\" asked Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"Every word,\" said Dorothy, and Ozma and Glinda both looked at the\r\nRecord and seemed surprised and perplexed.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Glinda,\" said Ozma, \"who are the Flatheads?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot, your Majesty,\" confessed the Sorceress. \"Until now I never\r\nhave heard of them, nor have I ever heard the Skeezers mentioned. In\r\nthe faraway corners of Oz are hidden many curious tribes of people,\r\nand those who never leave their own countries and never are visited by\r\nthose from our favored part of Oz, naturally are unknown to me.\r\nHowever, if you so desire, I can learn through my arts of sorcery\r\nsomething of the Skeezers and the Flatheads.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would,\" answered Ozma seriously. \"You see, Glinda, if\r\nthese are Oz people they are my subjects and I cannot allow any wars\r\nor troubles in the Land I rule, if I can possibly help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, your Majesty,\" said the Sorceress, \"I will try to get some\r\ninformation to guide you. Please excuse me for a time, while I retire\r\nto my Room of Magic and Sorcery.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I go with you?\" asked Dorothy, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"No, Princess,\" was the reply. \"It would spoil the charm to have\r\nanyone present.\"\r\n\r\nSo Glinda locked herself in her own Room of Magic and Dorothy and Ozma\r\nwaited patiently for her to come out again.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour Glinda appeared, looking grave and thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty,\" she said to Ozma, \"the Skeezers live on a Magic Isle\r\nin a great lake. For that reason--because the Skeezers deal in\r\nmagic--I can learn little about them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I didn't know there was a lake in that part of Oz,\" exclaimed\r\nOzma. \"The map shows a river running through the Skeezer Country, but\r\nno lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is because the person who made the map never had visited that\r\npart of the country,\" explained the Sorceress. \"The lake surely is\r\nthere, and in the lake is an island--a Magic Isle--and on that island\r\nlive the people called the Skeezers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they like?\" inquired the Ruler of Oz.\r\n\r\n\"My magic cannot tell me that,\" confessed Glinda, \"for the magic of\r\nthe Skeezers prevents anyone outside of their domain knowing anything\r\nabout them.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Flatheads must know, if they're going to fight the Skeezers,\"\r\nsuggested Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so,\" Glinda replied, \"but I can get little information\r\nconcerning the Flatheads, either. They are people who inhabit a\r\nmountain just south of the Lake of the Skeezers. The mountain has\r\nsteep sides and a broad, hollow top, like a basin, and in this basin\r\nthe Flatheads have their dwellings. They also are magic-workers and\r\nusually keep to themselves and allow no one from outside to visit\r\nthem. I have learned that the Flatheads number about one hundred\r\npeople--men, women and children--while the Skeezers number just one\r\nhundred and one.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did they quarrel about, and why do they wish to fight one\r\nanother?\" was Ozma's next question.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell your Majesty that,\" said Glinda.\r\n\r\n\"But see here!\" cried Dorothy, \"it's against the law for anyone but\r\nGlinda and the Wizard to work magic in the Land of Oz, so if these two\r\nstrange people are magic-makers they are breaking the law and ought to\r\nbe punished!\"\r\n\r\nOzma smiled upon her little friend.\r\n\r\n\"Those who do not know me or my laws,\" she said, \"cannot be expected\r\nto obey my laws. If we know nothing of the Skeezers or the Flatheads,\r\nit is likely that they know nothing of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they _ought_ to know, Ozma, and _we_ ought to know. Who's going\r\nto tell them, and how are we going to make them behave?\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" returned Ozma, \"is what I am now considering. What would you\r\nadvise, Glinda?\"\r\n\r\nThe Sorceress took a little time to consider this question, before she\r\nmade reply. Then she said:\r\n\r\n\"Had you not learned of the existence of the Flatheads and the\r\nSkeezers, through my Book of Records, you would never have worried\r\nabout them or their quarrels. So, if you pay no attention to these\r\npeoples, you may never hear of them again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that wouldn't be right,\" declared Ozma. \"I am Ruler of all the\r\nLand of Oz, which includes the Gillikin Country, the Quadling\r\nCountry, the Winkie Country and the Munchkin Country, as well as the\r\nEmerald City, and being the Princess of this fairyland it is my duty\r\nto make all my people--wherever they may be--happy and content and to\r\nsettle their disputes and keep them from quarreling. So, while the\r\nSkeezers and Flatheads may not know me or that I am their lawful\r\nRuler, I now know that they inhabit my kingdom and are my subjects, so\r\nI would not be doing my duty if I kept away from them and allowed them\r\nto fight.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a fact, Ozma,\" commented Dorothy. \"You've got to go up to the\r\nGillikin Country and make these people behave themselves and make up\r\ntheir quarrels. But how are you going to do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what is puzzling me also, your Majesty,\" said the Sorceress.\r\n\"It may be dangerous for you to go into those strange countries, where\r\nthe people are possibly fierce and warlike.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid,\" said Ozma, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"'Tisn't a question of being 'fraid,\" argued Dorothy. \"Of course we\r\nknow you're a fairy, and can't be killed or hurt, and we know you've a\r\nlot of magic of your own to help you. But, Ozma dear, in spite of all\r\nthis you've been in trouble before, on account of wicked enemies, and\r\nit isn't right for the Ruler of all Oz to put herself in danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I shall be in no danger at all,\" returned Ozma, with a little\r\nlaugh. \"You mustn't _imagine_ danger, Dorothy, for one should only\r\nimagine nice things, and we do not know that the Skeezers and\r\nFlatheads are wicked people or my enemies. Perhaps they would be good\r\nand listen to reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dorothy is right, your Majesty,\" asserted the Sorceress. \"It is true\r\nwe know nothing of these faraway subjects, except that they intend to\r\nfight one another, and have a certain amount of magic power at their\r\ncommand. Such folks do not like to submit to interference and they are\r\nmore likely to resent your coming among them than to receive you\r\nkindly and graciously, as is your due.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you had an army to take with you,\" added Dorothy, \"it wouldn't be\r\nso bad; but there isn't such a thing as an army in all Oz.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have one soldier,\" said Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the soldier with the green whiskers; but he's dreadful 'fraid of\r\nhis gun and never loads it. I'm sure he'd run rather than fight. And\r\none soldier, even if he were brave, couldn't do much against two\r\nhundred and one Flatheads and Skeezers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then, my friends, would you suggest?\" inquired Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"I advise you to send the Wizard of Oz to them, and let him inform\r\nthem that it is against the laws of Oz to fight, and that you command\r\nthem to settle their differences and become friends,\" proposed Glinda.\r\n\"Let the Wizard tell them they will be punished if they refuse to obey\r\nthe commands of the Princess of all the Land of Oz.\"\r\n\r\nOzma shook her head, to indicate that the advice was not to her\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"If they refuse, what then?\" she asked. \"I should be obliged to carry\r\nout my threat and punish them, and that would be an unpleasant and\r\ndifficult thing to do. I am sure it would be better for me to go\r\npeacefully, without an army and armed only with my authority as Ruler,\r\nand plead with them to obey me. Then, if they prove obstinate I could\r\nresort to other means to win their obedience.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a ticklish thing, anyhow you look at it,\" sighed Dorothy. \"I'm\r\nsorry now that I noticed the Record in the Great Book.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can't you realize, my dear, that I must do my duty, now that I am\r\naware of this trouble?\" asked Ozma. \"I am fully determined to go at\r\nonce to the Magic Isle of the Skeezers and to the enchanted mountain\r\nof the Flatheads, and prevent war and strife between their\r\ninhabitants. The only question to decide is whether it is better for\r\nme to go alone, or to assemble a party of my friends and loyal\r\nsupporters to accompany me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you go I want to go, too,\" declared Dorothy. \"Whatever happens\r\nit's going to be fun--'cause all excitement is fun--and I wouldn't\r\nmiss it for the world!\"\r\n\r\nNeither Ozma nor Glinda paid any attention to this statement, for they\r\nwere gravely considering the serious aspect of this proposed\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n\"There are plenty of friends who would like to go with you,\" said the\r\nSorceress, \"but none of them would afford your Majesty any protection\r\nin case you were in danger. You are yourself the most powerful fairy\r\nin Oz, although both I and the Wizard have more varied arts of magic\r\nat our command. However, you have one art that no other in all the\r\nworld can equal--the art of winning hearts and making people love to\r\nbow to your gracious presence. For that reason I believe you can\r\naccomplish more good alone than with a large number of subjects in\r\nyour train.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that also,\" agreed the Princess. \"I shall be quite able to\r\ntake care of myself, you know, but might not be able to protect others\r\nso well. I do not look for opposition, however. I shall speak to these\r\npeople in kindly words and settle their dispute--whatever it may\r\nbe--in a just manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you going to take _me_?\" pleaded Dorothy. \"You'll need _some_\r\ncompanion, Ozma.\"\r\n\r\nThe Princess smiled upon her little friend.\r\n\r\n\"I see no reason why you should not accompany me,\" was her reply.\r\n\"Two girls are not very warlike and they will not suspect us of being\r\non any errand but a kindly and peaceful one. But, in order to prevent\r\nwar and strife between these angry peoples, we must go to them at\r\nonce. Let us return immediately to the Emerald City and prepare to\r\nstart on our journey early tomorrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nGlinda was not quite satisfied with this plan, but could not think of\r\nany better way to meet the problem. She knew that Ozma, with all her\r\ngentleness and sweet disposition, was accustomed to abide by any\r\ndecision she had made and could not easily be turned from her purpose.\r\nMoreover she could see no great danger to the fairy Ruler of Oz in the\r\nundertaking, even though the unknown people she was to visit proved\r\nobstinate. But Dorothy was not a fairy; she was a little girl who had\r\ncome from Kansas to live in the Land of Oz. Dorothy might encounter\r\ndangers that to Ozma would be as nothing but to an \"Earth child\" would\r\nbe very serious.\r\n\r\nThe very fact that Dorothy lived in Oz, and had been made a Princess\r\nby her friend Ozma, prevented her from being killed or suffering any\r\ngreat bodily pain as long as she lived in that fairyland. She could\r\nnot grow big, either, and would always remain the same little girl\r\nwho had come to Oz, unless in some way she left that fairyland or was\r\nspirited away from it. But Dorothy was a mortal, nevertheless, and\r\nmight possibly be destroyed, or hidden where none of her friends could\r\never find her. She could, for instance, be cut into pieces, and the\r\npieces, while still alive and free from pain, could be widely\r\nscattered; or she might be buried deep underground, or \"destroyed\" in\r\nother ways by evil magicians, were she not properly protected. These\r\nfacts Glinda was considering while she paced with stately tread her\r\nmarble hall.\r\n\r\nFinally the good Sorceress paused and drew a ring from her finger,\r\nhanding it to Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Wear this ring constantly until your return,\" she said to the girl.\r\n\"If serious danger threatens you, turn the ring around on your finger\r\nonce to the right and another turn to the left. That will ring the\r\nalarm bell in my palace and I will at once come to your rescue. But do\r\nnot use the ring unless you are actually in danger of destruction.\r\nWhile you remain with Princess Ozma I believe she will be able to\r\nprotect you from all lesser ills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Glinda,\" responded Dorothy gratefully, as she placed the\r\nring on her finger. \"I'm going to wear my Magic Belt which I took from\r\nthe Nome King, too, so I guess I'll be safe from anything the Skeezers\r\nand Flatheads try to do to me.\"\r\n\r\nOzma had many arrangements to make before she could leave her throne\r\nand her palace in the Emerald City, even for a trip of a few days, so\r\nshe bade good-bye to Glinda and with Dorothy climbed into the Red\r\nWagon. A word to the wooden Sawhorse started that astonishing creature\r\non the return journey, and so swiftly did he run that Dorothy was\r\nunable to talk or do anything but hold tight to her seat all the way\r\nback to the Emerald City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\n\r\nOzma and Dorothy\r\n\r\n\r\nResiding in Ozma's palace at this time was a live Scarecrow, a most\r\nremarkable and intelligent creature who had once ruled the Land of Oz\r\nfor a brief period and was much loved and respected by all the\r\npeople. Once a Munchkin farmer had stuffed an old suit of clothes with\r\nstraw and put stuffed boots on the feet and used a pair of stuffed\r\ncotton gloves for hands. The head of the Scarecrow was a stuffed sack\r\nfastened to the body, with eyes, nose, mouth and ears painted on the\r\nsack. When a hat had been put on the head, the thing was a good\r\nimitation of a man. The farmer placed the Scarecrow on a pole in his\r\ncornfield and it came to life in a curious manner. Dorothy, who was\r\npassing by the field, was hailed by the live Scarecrow and lifted him\r\noff his pole. He then went with her to the Emerald City, where the\r\nWizard of Oz gave him some excellent brains, and the Scarecrow soon\r\nbecame an important personage.\r\n\r\nOzma considered the Scarecrow one of her best friends and most loyal\r\nsubjects, so the morning after her visit to Glinda she asked him to\r\ntake her place as Ruler of the Land of Oz while she was absent on a\r\njourney, and the Scarecrow at once consented without asking any\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nOzma had warned Dorothy to keep their journey a secret and say nothing\r\nto anyone about the Skeezers and Flatheads until their return, and\r\nDorothy promised to obey. She longed to tell her girl friends, tiny\r\nTrot and Betsy Bobbin, of the adventure they were undertaking, but\r\nrefrained from saying a word on the subject although both these girls\r\nlived with her in Ozma's palace.\r\n\r\nIndeed, only Glinda the Sorceress knew they were going, until after\r\nthey had gone, and even the Sorceress didn't know what their errand\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\nPrincess Ozma took the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon, although she was\r\nnot sure there was a wagon road all the way to the Lake of the\r\nSkeezers. The Land of Oz is a pretty big place, surrounded on all\r\nsides by a Deadly Desert which it is impossible to cross, and the\r\nSkeezer Country, according to the map, was in the farthest\r\nnorthwestern part of Oz, bordering on the north desert. As the Emerald\r\nCity was exactly in the center of Oz, it was no small journey from\r\nthere to the Skeezers.\r\n\r\nAround the Emerald City the country is thickly settled in every\r\ndirection, but the farther away you get from the city the fewer people\r\nthere are, until those parts that border on the desert have small\r\npopulations. Also those faraway sections are little known to the Oz\r\npeople, except in the south, where Glinda lives and where Dorothy has\r\noften wandered on trips of exploration.\r\n\r\nThe least known of all is the Gillikin Country, which harbors many\r\nstrange bands of people among its mountains and valleys and forests\r\nand streams, and Ozma was now bound for the most distant part of the\r\nGillikin Country.\r\n\r\n\"I am really sorry,\" said Ozma to Dorothy, as they rode away in the\r\nRed Wagon, \"not to know more about the wonderful Land I rule. It is my\r\nduty to be acquainted with every tribe of people and every strange and\r\nhidden country in all Oz, but I am kept so busy at my palace making\r\nlaws and planning for the comforts of those who live near the Emerald\r\nCity, that I do not often find time to make long journeys.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Dorothy, \"we'll prob'bly find out a lot on this trip,\r\nand we'll learn all about the Skeezers and Flatheads, anyhow. Time\r\ndoesn't make much diff'rence in the Land of Oz, 'cause we don't grow\r\nup, or get old, or become sick and die, as they do other places; so,\r\nif we explore one place at a time, we'll by-an'-by know all about\r\nevery nook and corner in Oz.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy wore around her waist the Nome King's Magic Belt, which\r\nprotected her from harm, and the Magic Ring which Glinda had given her\r\nwas on her finger. Ozma had merely slipped a small silver wand into\r\nthe bosom of her gown, for fairies do not use chemicals and herbs and\r\nthe tools of wizards and sorcerers to perform their magic. The Silver\r\nWand was Ozma's one weapon of offense and defense and by its use she\r\ncould accomplish many things.\r\n\r\nThey had left the Emerald City just at sunrise and the Sawhorse\r\ntraveled very swiftly over the roads towards the north, but in a few\r\nhours the wooden animal had to slacken his pace because the farm\r\nhouses had become few and far between and often there were no paths at\r\nall in the direction they wished to follow. At such times they crossed\r\nthe fields, avoiding groups of trees and fording the streams and\r\nrivulets whenever they came to them. But finally they reached a broad\r\nhillside closely covered with scrubby brush, through which the wagon\r\ncould not pass.\r\n\r\n\"It will be difficult even for you and me to get through without\r\ntearing our dresses,\" said Ozma, \"so we must leave the Sawhorse and\r\nthe Wagon here until our return.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" Dorothy replied, \"I'm tired riding, anyhow. Do you\r\ns'pose, Ozma, we're anywhere near the Skeezer Country?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell, Dorothy dear, but I know we've been going in the right\r\ndirection, so we are sure to find it in time.\"\r\n\r\nThe scrubby brush was almost like a grove of small trees, for it\r\nreached as high as the heads of the two girls, neither of whom was\r\nvery tall. They were obliged to thread their way in and out, until\r\nDorothy was afraid they would get lost, and finally they were halted\r\nby a curious thing that barred their further progress. It was a huge\r\nweb--as if woven by gigantic spiders--and the delicate, lacy film was\r\nfastened stoutly to the branches of the bushes and continued to the\r\nright and left in the form of a half circle. The threads of this web\r\nwere of a brilliant purple color and woven into numerous artistic\r\npatterns, but it reached from the ground to branches above the heads\r\nof the girls and formed a sort of fence that hedged them in.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't look very strong, though,\" said Dorothy. \"I wonder if we\r\ncouldn't break through.\" She tried but found the web stronger than it\r\nseemed. All her efforts could not break a single thread.\r\n\r\n\"We must go back, I think, and try to get around this peculiar web,\"\r\nOzma decided.\r\n\r\nSo they turned to the right and, following the web, found that it\r\nseemed to spread in a regular circle. On and on they went until\r\nfinally Ozma said they had returned to the exact spot from which they\r\nhad started. \"Here is a handkerchief you dropped when we were here\r\nbefore,\" she said to Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"In that case, they must have built the web behind us, after we walked\r\ninto the trap,\" exclaimed the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" agreed Ozma, \"an enemy has tried to imprison us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they did it, too,\" said Dorothy. \"I wonder who it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a spider-web, I'm quite sure,\" returned Ozma, \"but it must be\r\nthe work of enormous spiders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right!\" cried a voice behind them. Turning quickly around they\r\nbeheld a huge purple spider sitting not two yards away and regarding\r\nthem with its small bright eyes.\r\n\r\nThen there crawled from the bushes a dozen more great purple spiders,\r\nwhich saluted the first one and said:\r\n\r\n\"The web is finished, O King, and the strangers are our prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy did not like the looks of these spiders at all. They had big\r\nheads, sharp claws, small eyes and fuzzy hair all over their purple\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n\"They look wicked,\" she whispered to Ozma. \"What shall we do?\"\r\n\r\nOzma gazed upon the spiders with a serious face.\r\n\r\n\"What is your object in making us prisoners?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"We need someone to keep house for us,\" answered the Spider King.\r\n\"There is sweeping and dusting to be done, and polishing and washing\r\nof dishes, and that is work my people dislike to do. So we decided\r\nthat if any strangers came our way we would capture them and make them\r\nour servants.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Princess Ozma, Ruler of all Oz,\" said the girl with dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am King of all Spiders,\" was the reply, \"and that makes me\r\nyour master. Come with me to my palace and I will instruct you in your\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" said Dorothy indignantly. \"We won't have anything to do\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see about that,\" returned the Spider in a severe tone, and the\r\nnext instant he made a dive straight at Dorothy, opening the claws in\r\nhis legs as if to grab and pinch her with the sharp points. But the\r\ngirl was wearing her Magic Belt and was not harmed. The Spider King\r\ncould not even touch her.\r\n\r\nHe turned swiftly and made a dash at Ozma, but she held her Magic Wand\r\nover his head and the monster recoiled as if it had been struck.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better let us go,\" Dorothy advised him, \"for you see you can't\r\nhurt us.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I see,\" returned the Spider King angrily. \"Your magic is greater\r\nthan mine. But I'll not help you to escape. If you can break the magic\r\nweb my people have woven you may go; if not you must stay here and\r\nstarve.\" With that the Spider King uttered a peculiar whistle and all\r\nthe spiders disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"There is more magic in my fairyland than I dreamed of,\" remarked the\r\nbeautiful Ozma, with a sigh of regret. \"It seems that my laws have not\r\nbeen obeyed, for even these monstrous spiders defy me by means of\r\nmagic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that now,\" said Dorothy; \"let's see what we can do to get\r\nout of this trap.\"\r\n\r\nThey now examined the web with great care and were amazed at its\r\nstrength. Although finer than the finest silken hairs, it resisted all\r\ntheir efforts to work through, even though both girls threw all their\r\nweight against it.\r\n\r\n\"We must find some instrument which will cut the threads of the web,\"\r\nsaid Ozma, finally. \"Let us look about for such a tool.\"\r\n\r\nSo they wandered among the bushes and finally came to a shallow pool\r\nof water, formed by a small bubbling spring. Dorothy stooped to get a\r\ndrink and discovered in the water a green crab, about as big as her\r\nhand. The crab had two big, sharp claws, and as soon as Dorothy saw\r\nthem she had an idea that those claws could save them.\r\n\r\n\"Come out of the water,\" she called to the crab; \"I want to talk to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nRather lazily the crab rose to the surface and caught hold of a bit of\r\nrock. With his head above the water he said in a cross voice:\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"We want you to cut the web of the purple spiders with your claws, so\r\nwe can get through it,\" answered Dorothy. \"You can do that, can't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so,\" replied the crab. \"But if I do what will you give me?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you wish?\" Ozma inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to be white, instead of green,\" said the crab. \"Green crabs\r\nare very common, and white ones are rare; besides the purple spiders,\r\nwhich infest this hillside, are afraid of white crabs. Could you make\r\nme white if I should agree to cut the web for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Ozma, \"I can do that easily. And, so you may know I am\r\nspeaking the truth, I will change your color now.\"\r\n\r\nShe waved her silver wand over the pool and the crab instantly became\r\nsnow-white--all except his eyes, which remained black. The creature\r\nsaw his reflection in the water and was so delighted that he at once\r\nclimbed out of the pool and began moving slowly toward the web, by\r\nbacking away from the pool. He moved so very slowly that Dorothy cried\r\nout impatiently: \"Dear me, this will never do!\" Catching the crab in\r\nher hands she ran with him to the web.\r\n\r\nShe had to hold him up even then, so he could reach with his claws\r\nstrand after strand of the filmy purple web, which he was able to\r\nsever with one nip.\r\n\r\nWhen enough of the web had been cut to allow them to pass, Dorothy ran\r\nback to the pool and placed the white crab in the water, after which\r\nshe rejoined Ozma. They were just in time to escape through the web,\r\nfor several of the purple spiders now appeared, having discovered that\r\ntheir web had been cut, and had the girls not rushed through the\r\nopening the spiders would have quickly repaired the cuts and again\r\nimprisoned them.\r\n\r\nOzma and Dorothy ran as fast as they could and although the angry\r\nspiders threw a number of strands of web after them, hoping to lasso\r\nthem or entangle them in the coils, they managed to escape and clamber\r\nto the top of the hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n\r\nThe Mist Maidens\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the hill Ozma and Dorothy looked down into the valley\r\nbeyond and were surprised to find it filled with a floating mist that\r\nwas as dense as smoke. Nothing in the valley was visible except these\r\nrolling waves of mist, but beyond, on the other side, rose a grassy\r\nhill that appeared quite beautiful.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"what are we to do, Ozma? Walk down into that\r\nthick fog, an' prob'bly get lost in it, or wait till it clears away?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure it will clear away, however long we wait,\" replied Ozma,\r\ndoubtfully. \"If we wish to get on, I think we must venture into the\r\nmist.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we can't see where we're going, or what we're stepping on,\"\r\nprotested Dorothy. \"There may be dreadful things mixed up in that fog,\r\nan' I'm scared just to think of wading into it.\"\r\n\r\nEven Ozma seemed to hesitate. She was silent and thoughtful for a\r\nlittle while, looking at the rolling drifts that were so gray and\r\nforbidding. Finally she said:\r\n\r\n\"I believe this is a Mist Valley, where these moist clouds always\r\nremain, for even the sunshine above does not drive them away.\r\nTherefore the Mist Maids must live here, and they are fairies and\r\nshould answer my call.\"\r\n\r\nShe placed her two hands before her mouth, forming a hollow with them,\r\nand uttered a clear, thrilling, bird-like cry. It floated far out over\r\nthe mist waves and presently was answered by a similar sound, as of a\r\nfar-off echo.\r\n\r\nDorothy was much impressed. She had seen many strange things since\r\ncoming to this fairy country, but here was a new experience. At\r\nordinary times Ozma was just like any little girl one might chance to\r\nmeet--simple, merry, lovable as could be--yet with a certain reserve\r\nthat lent her dignity in her most joyous moods. There were times,\r\nhowever, when seated on her throne and commanding her subjects, or\r\nwhen her fairy powers were called into use, when Dorothy and all\r\nothers about her stood in awe of their lovely girl Ruler and realized\r\nher superiority.\r\n\r\nOzma waited. Presently out from the billows rose beautiful forms,\r\nclothed in fleecy, trailing garments of gray that could scarcely be\r\ndistinguished from the mist. Their hair was mist-color, too; only\r\ntheir gleaming arms and sweet, pallid faces proved they were living,\r\nintelligent creatures answering the call of a sister fairy.\r\n\r\nLike sea nymphs they rested on the bosom of the clouds, their eyes\r\nturned questioningly upon the two girls who stood upon the bank. One\r\ncame quite near and to her Ozma said:\r\n\r\n\"Will you please take us to the opposite hillside? We are afraid to\r\nventure into the mist. I am Princess Ozma of Oz, and this is my friend\r\nDorothy, a Princess of Oz.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mist Maids came nearer, holding out their arms. Without hesitation\r\nOzma advanced and allowed them to embrace her and Dorothy plucked up\r\ncourage to follow. Very gently the Mist Maids held them. Dorothy\r\nthought the arms were cold and misty--they didn't seem real at\r\nall--yet they supported the two girls above the surface of the billows\r\nand floated with them so swiftly to the green hillside opposite that\r\nthe girls were astonished to find themselves set upon the grass before\r\nthey realized they had fairly started.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you!\" said Ozma gratefully, and Dorothy also added her thanks\r\nfor the service.\r\n\r\nThe Mist Maids made no answer, but they smiled and waved their hands\r\nin good-bye as again they floated out into the mist and disappeared\r\nfrom view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\n\r\nThe Magic Tent\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Dorothy with a laugh, \"that was easier than I expected.\r\nIt's worth while, sometimes, to be a real fairy. But I wouldn't like\r\nto be that kind, and live in a dreadful fog all the time.\"\r\n\r\nThey now climbed the bank and found before them a delightful plain\r\nthat spread for miles in all directions. Fragrant wild flowers were\r\nscattered throughout the grass; there were bushes bearing lovely\r\nblossoms and luscious fruits; now and then a group of stately trees\r\nadded to the beauty of the landscape. But there were no dwellings or\r\nsigns of life.\r\n\r\nThe farther side of the plain was bordered by a row of palms, and just\r\nin front of the palms rose a queerly shaped hill that towered above\r\nthe plain like a mountain. The sides of this hill were straight up and\r\ndown; it was oblong in shape and the top seemed flat and level.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ho!\" cried Dorothy; \"I'll bet that's the mountain Glinda told us\r\nof, where the Flatheads live.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it is,\" replied Ozma, \"the Lake of the Skeezers must be just\r\nbeyond the line of palm trees. Can you walk that far, Dorothy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, in time,\" was the prompt answer. \"I'm sorry we had to\r\nleave the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon behind us, for they'd come in\r\nhandy just now; but with the end of our journey in sight a tramp\r\nacross these pretty green fields won't tire us a bit.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a longer tramp than they suspected, however, and night overtook\r\nthem before they could reach the flat mountain. So Ozma proposed they\r\ncamp for the night and Dorothy was quite ready to approve. She didn't\r\nlike to admit to her friend she was tired, but she told herself that\r\nher legs \"had prickers in 'em,\" meaning they had begun to ache.\r\n\r\nUsually when Dorothy started on a journey of exploration or adventure,\r\nshe carried with her a basket of food, and other things that a\r\ntraveler in a strange country might require, but to go away with Ozma\r\nwas quite a different thing, as experience had taught her. The fairy\r\nRuler of Oz only needed her silver wand--tipped at one end with a\r\ngreat sparkling emerald--to provide through its magic all that they\r\nmight need. Therefore Ozma, having halted with her companion and\r\nselected a smooth, grassy spot on the plain, waved her wand in\r\ngraceful curves and chanted some mystic words in her sweet voice, and\r\nin an instant a handsome tent appeared before them. The canvas was\r\nstriped purple and white, and from the center pole fluttered the royal\r\nbanner of Oz.\r\n\r\n\"Come, dear,\" said Ozma, taking Dorothy's hand, \"I am hungry and I'm\r\nsure you must be also; so let us go in and have our feast.\"\r\n\r\nOn entering the tent they found a table set for two, with snowy linen,\r\nbright silver and sparkling glassware, a vase of roses in the center\r\nand many dishes of delicious food, some smoking hot, waiting to\r\nsatisfy their hunger. Also, on either side of the tent were beds, with\r\nsatin sheets, warm blankets and pillows filled with swansdown. There\r\nwere chairs, too, and tall lamps that lighted the interior of the tent\r\nwith a soft, rosy glow.\r\n\r\nDorothy, resting herself at her fairy friend's command, and eating her\r\ndinner with unusual enjoyment, thought of the wonders of magic. If one\r\nwere a fairy and knew the secret laws of nature and the mystic words\r\nand ceremonies that commanded those laws, then a simple wave of a\r\nsilver wand would produce instantly all that men work hard and\r\nanxiously for through weary years. And Dorothy wished in her kindly,\r\ninnocent heart, that all men and women could be fairies with silver\r\nwands, and satisfy all their needs without so much work and worry, for\r\nthen, she imagined, they would have all their working hours to be\r\nhappy in. But Ozma, looking into her friend's face and reading those\r\nthoughts, gave a laugh and said:\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Dorothy, that wouldn't do at all. Instead of happiness your\r\nplan would bring weariness to the world. If every one could wave a\r\nwand and have his wants fulfilled there would be little to wish for.\r\nThere would be no eager striving to obtain the difficult, for nothing\r\nwould then be difficult, and the pleasure of earning something longed\r\nfor, and only to be secured by hard work and careful thought, would be\r\nutterly lost. There would be nothing to do, you see, and no interest\r\nin life and in our fellow creatures. That is all that makes life worth\r\nour while--to do good deeds and to help those less fortunate than\r\nourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you're a fairy, Ozma. Aren't you happy?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear, because I can use my fairy powers to make others happy.\r\nHad I no kingdom to rule, and no subjects to look after, I would be\r\nmiserable. Also, you must realize that while I am a more powerful\r\nfairy than any other inhabitant of Oz, I am not as powerful as Glinda\r\nthe Sorceress, who has studied many arts of magic that I know nothing\r\nof. Even the little Wizard of Oz can do some things I am unable to\r\naccomplish, while I can accomplish things unknown to the Wizard. This\r\nis to explain that I am not all-powerful, by any means. My magic is\r\nsimply fairy magic, and not sorcery or wizardry.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the same,\" said Dorothy, \"I'm mighty glad you could make this\r\ntent appear, with our dinners and beds all ready for us.\"\r\n\r\nOzma smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is indeed wonderful,\" she agreed. \"Not all fairies know that\r\nsort of magic, but some fairies can do magic that fills me with\r\nastonishment. I think that is what makes us modest and unassuming--the\r\nfact that our magic arts are divided, some being given each of us. I'm\r\nglad I don't know everything, Dorothy, and that there still are things\r\nin both nature and in wit for me to marvel at.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy couldn't quite understand this, so she said nothing more on\r\nthe subject and presently had a new reason to marvel. For when they\r\nhad quite finished their meal table and contents disappeared in a\r\nflash.\r\n\r\n\"No dishes to wash, Ozma!\" she said with a laugh. \"I guess you'd make\r\na lot of folks happy if you could teach 'em just that one trick.\"\r\n\r\nFor an hour Ozma told stories, and talked with Dorothy about various\r\npeople in whom they were interested. And then it was bedtime, and they\r\nundressed and crept into their soft beds and fell asleep almost as\r\nsoon as their heads touched their pillows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5\r\n\r\nThe Magic Stairway\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flat mountain looked much nearer in the clear light of the morning\r\nsun, but Dorothy and Ozma knew there was a long tramp before them,\r\neven yet. They finished dressing only to find a warm, delicious\r\nbreakfast awaiting them, and having eaten they left the tent and\r\nstarted toward the mountain which was their first goal. After going a\r\nlittle way Dorothy looked back and found that the fairy tent had\r\nentirely disappeared. She was not surprised, for she knew this would\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n\"Can't your magic give us a horse an' wagon, or an automobile?\"\r\ninquired Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"No, dear; I'm sorry that such magic is beyond my power,\" confessed\r\nher fairy friend.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps Glinda could,\" said Dorothy thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Glinda has a stork chariot that carries her through the air,\" said\r\nOzma, \"but even our great Sorceress cannot conjure up other modes of\r\ntravel. Don't forget what I told you last night, that no one is\r\npowerful enough to do everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I s'pose I ought to know that, having lived so long in the Land\r\nof Oz,\" replied Dorothy; \"but _I_ can't do any magic at all, an' so I\r\ncan't figure out e'zactly how you an' Glinda an' the Wizard do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't try,\" laughed Ozma. \"But you have at least one magical art,\r\nDorothy: you know the trick of winning all hearts.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't,\" said Dorothy earnestly. \"If I really can do it, Ozma,\r\nI am sure I don't know _how_ I do it.\"\r\n\r\nIt took them a good two hours to reach the foot of the round, flat\r\nmountain, and then they found the sides so steep that they were like\r\nthe wall of a house.\r\n\r\n\"Even my purple kitten couldn't climb 'em,\" remarked Dorothy, gazing\r\nupward.\r\n\r\n\"But there is some way for the Flatheads to get down and up again,\"\r\ndeclared Ozma; \"otherwise they couldn't make war with the Skeezers, or\r\neven meet them and quarrel with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so, Ozma. Let's walk around a ways; perhaps we'll find a\r\nladder or something.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked quite a distance, for it was a big mountain, and as they\r\ncircled around it and came to the side that faced the palm trees, they\r\nsuddenly discovered an entrance way cut out of the rock wall. This\r\nentrance was arched overhead and not very deep because it merely led\r\nto a short flight of stone stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we've found a way to the top at last,\" announced Ozma, and the\r\ntwo girls turned and walked straight toward the entrance. Suddenly\r\nthey bumped against something and stood still, unable to proceed\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed Dorothy, rubbing her nose, which had struck\r\nsomething hard, although she could not see what it was; \"this isn't\r\nas easy as it looks. What has stopped us, Ozma? Is it magic of some\r\nsort?\"\r\n\r\nOzma was feeling around, her hands outstretched before her.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear, it is magic,\" she replied. \"The Flatheads had to have a\r\nway from their mountain top from the plain below, but to prevent\r\nenemies from rushing up the stairs to conquer them, they have built,\r\nat a small distance before the entrance a wall of solid stone, the\r\nstones being held in place by cement, and then they made the wall\r\ninvisible.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder why they did that?\" mused Dorothy. \"A wall would keep folks\r\nout anyhow, whether it could be seen or not, so there wasn't any use\r\nmaking it invisible. Seems to me it would have been better to have\r\nleft it solid, for then no one would have seen the entrance behind it.\r\nNow anybody can see the entrance, as we did. And prob'bly anybody that\r\ntries to go up the stairs gets bumped, as we did.\"\r\n\r\nOzma made no reply at once. Her face was grave and thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"I think I know the reason for making the wall invisible,\" she said\r\nafter a while. \"The Flatheads use the stairs for coming down and going\r\nup. If there was a solid stone wall to keep them from reaching the\r\nplain they would themselves be imprisoned by the wall. So they had to\r\nleave some place to get around the wall, and, if the wall was visible,\r\nall strangers or enemies would find the place to go around it and then\r\nthe wall would be useless. So the Flatheads cunningly made their wall\r\ninvisible, believing that everyone who saw the entrance to the\r\nmountain would walk straight toward it, as we did, and find it\r\nimpossible to go any farther. I suppose the wall is really high and\r\nthick, and can't be broken through, so those who find it in their way\r\nare obliged to go away again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"if there's a way around the wall, where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must find it,\" returned Ozma, and began feeling her way along the\r\nwall. Dorothy followed and began to get discouraged when Ozma had\r\nwalked nearly a quarter of a mile away from the entrance. But now the\r\ninvisible wall curved in toward the side of the mountain and suddenly\r\nended, leaving just space enough between the wall and the mountain for\r\nan ordinary person to pass through.\r\n\r\nThe girls went in, single file, and Ozma explained that they were now\r\nbehind the barrier and could go back to the entrance. They met no\r\nfurther obstructions.\r\n\r\n\"Most people, Ozma, wouldn't have figured this thing out the way you\r\ndid,\" remarked Dorothy. \"If I'd been alone the invisible wall surely\r\nwould have stumped me.\"\r\n\r\nReaching the entrance they began to mount the stone stairs. They went\r\nup ten stairs and then down five stairs, following a passage cut from\r\nthe rock. The stairs were just wide enough for the two girls to walk\r\nabreast, arm in arm. At the bottom of the five stairs the passage\r\nturned to the right, and they ascended ten more stairs, only to find\r\nat the top of the flight five stairs leading straight down again.\r\nAgain the passage turned abruptly, this time to the left, and ten more\r\nstairs led upward.\r\n\r\nThe passage was now quite dark, for they were in the heart of the\r\nmountain and all daylight had been shut out by the turns of the\r\npassage. However, Ozma drew her silver wand from her bosom and the\r\ngreat jewel at its end gave out a lustrous, green-tinted light which\r\nlighted the place well enough for them to see their way plainly.\r\n\r\nTen steps up, five steps down, and a turn, this way or that. That was\r\nthe program, and Dorothy figured that they were only gaining five\r\nstairs upward each trip that they made.\r\n\r\n\"Those Flatheads must be funny people,\" she said to Ozma. \"They don't\r\nseem to do anything in a bold, straightforward manner. In making this\r\npassage they forced everyone to walk three times as far as is\r\nnecessary. And of course this trip is just as tiresome to the\r\nFlatheads as it is to other folks.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" answered Ozma; \"yet it is a clever arrangement to\r\nprevent their being surprised by intruders. Every time we reach the\r\ntenth step of a flight, the pressure of our feet on the stone makes a\r\nbell ring on top of the mountain, to warn the Flatheads of our\r\ncoming.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\" demanded Dorothy, astonished.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard the bell ever since we started,\" Ozma told her. \"You could\r\nnot hear it, I know, but when I am holding my wand in my hand I can\r\nhear sounds a great distance off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear anything on top of the mountain 'cept the bell?\" inquired\r\nDorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The people are calling to one another in alarm and many\r\nfootsteps are approaching the place where we will reach the flat top\r\nof the mountain.\"\r\n\r\nThis made Dorothy feel somewhat anxious.\r\n\r\n\"I'd thought we were going to visit just common, ordinary people,\"\r\nshe remarked, \"but they're pretty clever, it seems, and they know some\r\nkinds of magic, too. They may be dangerous, Ozma. P'raps we'd better\r\nstayed at home.\"\r\n\r\nFinally the upstairs-and-downstairs passage seemed coming to an end,\r\nfor daylight again appeared ahead of the two girls and Ozma replaced\r\nher wand in the bosom of her gown. The last ten steps brought them to\r\nthe surface, where they found themselves surrounded by such a throng\r\nof queer people that for a time they halted, speechless, and stared\r\ninto the faces that confronted them.\r\n\r\nDorothy knew at once why these mountain people were called Flatheads.\r\nTheir heads were really flat on top, as if they had been cut off just\r\nabove the eyes and ears. Also the heads were bald, with no hair on top\r\nat all, and the ears were big and stuck straight out, and the noses\r\nwere small and stubby, while the mouths of the Flatheads were well\r\nshaped and not unusual. Their eyes were perhaps their best feature,\r\nbeing large and bright and a deep violet in color.\r\n\r\nThe costumes of the Flatheads were all made of metals dug from their\r\nmountain. Small gold, silver, tin and iron discs, about the size of\r\npennies, and very thin, were cleverly wired together and made to form\r\nknee trousers and jackets for the men and skirts and waists for the\r\nwomen. The colored metals were skillfully mixed to form stripes and\r\nchecks of various sorts, so that the costumes were quite gorgeous and\r\nreminded Dorothy of pictures she had seen of Knights of old clothed in\r\narmor.\r\n\r\nAside from their flat heads, these people were not really bad looking.\r\nThe men were armed with bows and arrows and had small axes of steel\r\nstuck in their metal belts. They wore no hats nor ornaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6\r\n\r\nFlathead Mountain\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they saw that the intruders on their mountain were only two\r\nlittle girls, the Flatheads grunted with satisfaction and drew back,\r\npermitting them to see what the mountain top looked like. It was\r\nshaped like a saucer, so that the houses and other buildings--all made\r\nof rocks--could not be seen over the edge by anyone standing in the\r\nplain below.\r\n\r\nBut now a big fat Flathead stood before the girls and in a gruff voice\r\ndemanded:\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here? Have the Skeezers sent you to spy upon us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Princess Ozma, Ruler of all the Land of Oz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've never heard of the Land of Oz, so you may be what you\r\nclaim,\" returned the Flathead.\r\n\r\n\"This is the Land of Oz--part of it, anyway,\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"So\r\nPrincess Ozma rules you Flathead people, as well as all the other\r\npeople in Oz.\"\r\n\r\nThe man laughed, and all the others who stood around laughed, too.\r\nSome one in the crowd called:\r\n\r\n\"She'd better not tell the Supreme Dictator about ruling the\r\nFlatheads. Eh, friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!\" they all answered in positive tones.\r\n\r\n\"Who is your Supreme Dictator?\" answered Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"I think I'll let him tell you that himself,\" answered the man who had\r\nfirst spoken. \"You have broken our laws by coming here; and whoever\r\nyou are the Supreme Dictator must fix your punishment. Come along with\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nHe started down a path and Ozma and Dorothy followed him without\r\nprotest, as they wanted to see the most important person in this queer\r\ncountry. The houses they passed seemed pleasant enough and each had a\r\nlittle yard in which were flowers and vegetables. Walls of rock\r\nseparated the dwellings, and all the paths were paved with smooth\r\nslabs of rock. This seemed their only building material and they\r\nutilized it cleverly for every purpose.\r\n\r\nDirectly in the center of the great saucer stood a larger building\r\nwhich the Flathead informed the girls was the palace of the Supreme\r\nDictator. He led them through an entrance hall into a big reception\r\nroom, where they sat upon stone benches and awaited the coming of the\r\nDictator. Pretty soon he entered from another room--a rather lean and\r\nrather old Flathead, dressed much like the others of this strange\r\nrace, and only distinguished from them by the sly and cunning\r\nexpression of his face. He kept his eyes half closed and looked\r\nthrough the slits of them at Ozma and Dorothy, who rose to receive\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the Supreme Dictator of the Flatheads?\" inquired Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's me,\" he said, rubbing his hands slowly together. \"My word\r\nis law. I'm the head of the Flatheads on this flat headland.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Princess Ozma of Oz, and I have come from the Emerald City\r\nto----\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop a minute,\" interrupted the Dictator, and turned to the man who\r\nhad brought the girls there. \"Go away, Dictator Felo Flathead!\" he\r\ncommanded. \"Return to your duty and guard the Stairway. I will look\r\nafter these strangers.\" The man bowed and departed, and Dorothy asked\r\nwonderingly:\r\n\r\n\"Is _he_ a Dictator, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" was the answer. \"Everybody here is a dictator of\r\nsomething or other. They're all office holders. That's what keeps them\r\ncontented. But I'm the Supreme Dictator of all, and I'm elected once\r\na year. This is a democracy, you know, where the people are allowed to\r\nvote for their rulers. A good many others would like to be Supreme\r\nDictator, but as I made a law that I am always to count the votes\r\nmyself, I am always elected.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" asked Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"I am called the Su-dic, which is short for Supreme Dictator. I sent\r\nthat man away because the moment you mentioned Ozma of Oz, and the\r\nEmerald City, I knew who you are. I suppose I'm the only Flathead that\r\never heard of you, but that's because I have more brains than the\r\nrest.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy was staring hard at the Su-dic.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how you can have any brains at all,\" she remarked,\r\n\"because the part of your head is gone where brains are kept.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't blame you for thinking that,\" he said. \"Once the Flatheads\r\nhad no brains because, as you say, there is no upper part to their\r\nheads, to hold brains. But long, long ago a band of fairies flew over\r\nthis country and made it all a fairyland, and when they came to the\r\nFlatheads the fairies were sorry to find them all very stupid and\r\nquite unable to think. So, as there was no good place in their bodies\r\nin which to put brains the Fairy Queen gave each one of us a nice can\r\nof brains to carry in his pocket and that made us just as intelligent\r\nas other people. See,\" he continued, \"here is one of the cans of\r\nbrains the fairies gave us.\" He took from a pocket a bright tin can\r\nhaving a pretty red label on it which said: \"Flathead Concentrated\r\nBrains, Extra Quality.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does every Flathead have the same kind of brains?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they're all alike. Here's another can.\" From another pocket he\r\nproduced a second can of brains.\r\n\r\n\"Did the fairies give you a double supply?\" inquired Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"No, but one of the Flatheads thought he wanted to be the Su-dic and\r\ntried to get my people to rebel against me, so I punished him by\r\ntaking away his brains. One day my wife scolded me severely, so I took\r\naway her can of brains. She didn't like that and went out and robbed\r\nseveral women of _their_ brains. Then I made a law that if anyone\r\nstole another's brains, or even tried to borrow them, he would forfeit\r\nhis own brains to the Su-dic. So each one is content with his own\r\ncanned brains and my wife and I are the only ones on the mountain with\r\nmore than one can. I have three cans and that makes me very clever--so\r\nclever that I'm a good Sorcerer, if I do say it myself. My poor wife\r\nhad four cans of brains and became a remarkable witch, but alas! that\r\nwas before those terrible enemies, the Skeezers, transformed her into\r\na Golden Pig.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Dorothy; \"is your wife really a Golden Pig?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is. The Skeezers did it and so I have declared war on them. In\r\nrevenge for making my wife a Pig I intend to ruin their Magic Island\r\nand make the Skeezers the slaves of the Flatheads!\"\r\n\r\nThe Su-dic was very angry now; his eyes flashed and his face took on a\r\nwicked and fierce expression. But Ozma said to him, very sweetly and\r\nin a friendly voice:\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to hear this. Will you please tell me more about your\r\ntroubles with the Skeezers? Then perhaps I can help you.\"\r\n\r\nShe was only a girl, but there was dignity in her pose and speech\r\nwhich impressed the Su-dic.\r\n\r\n\"If you are really Princess Ozma of Oz,\" the Flathead said, \"you are\r\none of that band of fairies who, under Queen Lurline, made all Oz a\r\nFairyland. I have heard that Lurline left one of her own fairies to\r\nrule Oz, and gave the fairy the name of Ozma.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you knew this why did you not come to me at the Emerald City and\r\ntender me your loyalty and obedience?\" asked the Ruler of Oz.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I only learned the fact lately, and I've been too busy to leave\r\nhome,\" he explained, looking at the floor instead of into Ozma's eyes.\r\nShe knew he had spoken a falsehood, but only said:\r\n\r\n\"Why did you quarrel with the Skeezers?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was this way,\" began the Su-dic, glad to change the subject. \"We\r\nFlatheads love fish, and as we have no fish on this mountain we would\r\nsometimes go to the Lake of the Skeezers to catch fish. This made the\r\nSkeezers angry, for they declared the fish in their lake belonged to\r\nthem and were under their protection and they forbade us to catch\r\nthem. That was very mean and unfriendly in the Skeezers, you must\r\nadmit, and when we paid no attention to their orders they set a guard\r\non the shore of the lake to prevent our fishing.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my wife, Rora Flathead, having four cans of brains, had become a\r\nwonderful witch, and fish being brain food, she loved to eat fish\r\nbetter than any one of us. So she vowed she would destroy every fish\r\nin the lake, unless the Skeezers let us catch what we wanted. They\r\ndefied us, so Rora prepared a kettleful of magic poison and went down\r\nto the lake one night to dump it all in the water and poison the fish.\r\nIt was a clever idea, quite worthy of my dear wife, but the Skeezer\r\nQueen--a young lady named Coo-ee-oh--hid on the bank of the lake and\r\ntaking Rora unawares, transformed her into a Golden Pig. The poison\r\nwas spilled on the ground and wicked Queen Coo-ee-oh, not content with\r\nher cruel transformation, even took away my wife's four cans of\r\nbrains, so she is now a common grunting pig without even brains enough\r\nto know her own name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Ozma thoughtfully, \"the Queen of the Skeezers must be a\r\nSorceress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Su-dic, \"but she doesn't know much magic, after all.\r\nShe is not as powerful as Rora Flathead was, nor half as powerful as I\r\nam now, as Queen Coo-ee-oh will discover when we fight our great\r\nbattle and destroy her.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Golden Pig can't be a witch any more, of course,\" observed\r\nDorothy.\r\n\r\n\"No; even had Queen Coo-ee-oh left her the four cans of brains, poor\r\nRora, in a pig's shape, couldn't do any witchcraft. A witch has to use\r\nher fingers, and a pig has only cloven hoofs.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems a sad story,\" was Ozma's comment, \"and all the trouble arose\r\nbecause the Flatheads wanted fish that did not belong to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for that,\" said the Su-dic, again angry, \"I made a law that any of\r\nmy people could catch fish in the Lake of the Skeezers, whenever they\r\nwanted to. So the trouble was through the Skeezers defying my law.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can only make laws to govern your own people,\" asserted Ozma\r\nsternly. \"I, alone, am empowered to make laws that must be obeyed by\r\nall the peoples of Oz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" cried the Su-dic scornfully. \"You can't make _me_ obey your\r\nlaws, I assure you. I know the extent of your powers, Princess Ozma of\r\nOz, and I know that I am more powerful than you are. To prove it I\r\nshall keep you and your companion prisoners in this mountain until\r\nafter we have fought and conquered the Skeezers. Then, if you promise\r\nto be good, I may let you go home again.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy was amazed by this effrontery and defiance of the beautiful\r\ngirl Ruler of Oz, whom all until now had obeyed without question. But\r\nOzma, still unruffled and dignified, looked at the Su-dic and said:\r\n\r\n\"You did not mean that. You are angry and speak unwisely, without\r\nreflection. I came here from my palace in the Emerald City to prevent\r\nwar and to make peace between you and the Skeezers. I do not approve\r\nof Queen Coo-ee-oh's action in transforming your wife Rora into a pig,\r\nnor do I approve of Rora's cruel attempt to poison the fishes in the\r\nlake. No one has the right to work magic in my dominions without my\r\nconsent, so the Flatheads and the Skeezers have both broken my\r\nlaws--which must be obeyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you want to make peace,\" said the Su-dic, \"make the Skeezers\r\nrestore my wife to her proper form and give back her four cans of\r\nbrains. Also make them agree to allow us to catch fish in their lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" returned Ozma, \"I will not do that, for it would be unjust. I\r\nwill have the Golden Pig again transformed into your wife Rora, and\r\ngive her one can of brains, but the other three cans must be restored\r\nto those she robbed. Neither may you catch fish in the Lake of the\r\nSkeezers, for it is their lake and the fish belong to them. This\r\narrangement is just and honorable, and you must agree to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" cried the Su-dic. Just then a pig came running into the room,\r\nuttering dismal grunts. It was made of solid gold, with joints at the\r\nbends of the legs and in the neck and jaws. The Golden Pig's eyes\r\nwere rubies, and its teeth were polished ivory.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" said the Su-dic, \"gaze on the evil work of Queen Coo-ee-oh,\r\nand then say if you can prevent my making war on the Skeezers. That\r\ngrunting beast was once my wife--the most beautiful Flathead on our\r\nmountain and a skillful witch. Now look at her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fight the Skeezers, fight the Skeezers, fight the Skeezers!\" grunted\r\nthe Golden Pig.\r\n\r\n\"I _will_ fight the Skeezers,\" exclaimed the Flathead chief, \"and if a\r\ndozen Ozmas of Oz forbade me I would fight just the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if I can prevent it!\" asserted Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"You can't prevent it. But since you threaten me, I'll have you\r\nconfined in the bronze prison until the war is over,\" said the Su-dic.\r\nHe whistled and four stout Flatheads, armed with axes and spears,\r\nentered the room and saluted him. Turning to the men he said: \"Take\r\nthese two girls, bind them with wire ropes and cast them into the\r\nbronze prison.\".\r\n\r\nThe four men bowed low and one of them asked:\r\n\r\n\"Where are the two girls, most noble Su-dic?\"\r\n\r\nThe Su-dic turned to where Ozma and Dorothy had stood but they had\r\nvanished!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7\r\n\r\nThe Magic Isle\r\n\r\n\r\nOzma, seeing it was useless to argue with the Supreme Dictator of the\r\nFlatheads, had been considering how best to escape from his power. She\r\nrealized that his sorcery might be difficult to overcome, and when he\r\nthreatened to cast Dorothy and her into a bronze prison she slipped\r\nher hand into her bosom and grasped her silver wand. With the other\r\nhand she grasped the hand of Dorothy, but these motions were so\r\nnatural that the Su-dic did not notice them. Then when he turned to\r\nmeet his four soldiers, Ozma instantly rendered both herself and\r\nDorothy invisible and swiftly led her companion around the group of\r\nFlatheads and out of the room. As they reached the entry and descended\r\nthe stone steps, Ozma whispered:\r\n\r\n\"Let us run, dear! We are invisible, so no one will see us.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy understood and she was a good runner. Ozma had marked the\r\nplace where the grand stairway that led to the plain was located, so\r\nthey made directly for it. Some people were in the paths but these\r\nthey dodged around. One or two Flatheads heard the pattering of\r\nfootsteps of the girls on the stone pavement and stopped with\r\nbewildered looks to gaze around them, but no one interfered with the\r\ninvisible fugitives.\r\n\r\nThe Su-dic had lost no time in starting the chase. He and his men ran\r\nso fast that they might have overtaken the girls before they reached\r\nthe stairway had not the Golden Pig suddenly run across their path.\r\nThe Su-dic tripped over the pig and fell flat, and his four men\r\ntripped over him and tumbled in a heap. Before they could scramble up\r\nand reach the mouth of the passage it was too late to stop the two\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nThere was a guard on each side of the stairway, but of course they did\r\nnot see Ozma and Dorothy as they sped past and descended the steps.\r\nThen they had to go up five steps and down another ten, and so on, in\r\nthe same manner in which they had climbed to the top of the mountain.\r\nOzma lighted their way with her wand and they kept on without relaxing\r\ntheir speed until they reached the bottom. Then they ran to the right\r\nand turned the corner of the invisible wall just as the Su-dic and his\r\nfollowers rushed out of the arched entrance and looked around in an\r\nattempt to discover the fugitives.\r\n\r\nOzma now knew they were safe, so she told Dorothy to stop and both of\r\nthem sat down on the grass until they could breathe freely and become\r\nrested from their mad flight.\r\n\r\nAs for the Su-dic, he realized he was foiled and soon turned and\r\nclimbed his stairs again. He was very angry--angry with Ozma and angry\r\nwith himself--because, now that he took time to think, he remembered\r\nthat he knew very well the art of making people invisible, and visible\r\nagain, and if he had only thought of it in time he could have used his\r\nmagic knowledge to make the girls visible and so have captured them\r\neasily. However, it was now too late for regrets and he determined to\r\nmake preparations at once to march all his forces against the\r\nSkeezers.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do next?\" asked Dorothy, when they were rested.\r\n\r\n\"Let us find the Lake of the Skeezers,\" replied Ozma. \"From what that\r\ndreadful Su-dic said I imagine the Skeezers are good people and worthy\r\nof our friendship, and if we go to them we may help them to defeat the\r\nFlatheads.\"\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose we can't stop the war now,\" remarked Dorothy reflectively,\r\nas they walked toward the row of palm trees.\r\n\r\n\"No; the Su-dic is determined to fight the Skeezers, so all we can do\r\nis to warn them of their danger and help them as much as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you'll punish the Flatheads,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I do not think the Flathead people are as much to blame as\r\ntheir Supreme Dictator,\" was the answer. \"If he is removed from power\r\nand his unlawful magic taken from him, the people will probably be\r\ngood and respect the laws of the Land of Oz, and live at peace with\r\nall their neighbors in the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" said Dorothy with a sigh of doubt.\r\n\r\nThe palms were not far from the mountain and the girls reached them\r\nafter a brisk walk. The huge trees were set close together, in three\r\nrows, and had been planted so as to keep people from passing them, but\r\nthe Flatheads had cut a passage through this barrier and Ozma found\r\nthe path and led Dorothy to the other side.\r\n\r\nBeyond the palms they discovered a very beautiful scene. Bordered by a\r\ngreen lawn was a great lake fully a mile from shore to shore, the\r\nwaters of which were exquisitely blue and sparkling, with little\r\nwavelets breaking its smooth surface where the breezes touched it. In\r\nthe center of this lake appeared a lovely island, not of great extent\r\nbut almost entirely covered by a huge round building with glass walls\r\nand a high glass dome which glittered brilliantly in the sunshine.\r\nBetween the glass building and the edge of the island was no grass,\r\nflowers or shrubbery, but only an expanse of highly polished white\r\nmarble. There were no boats on either shore and no signs of life\r\ncould be seen anywhere on the island.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Dorothy, gazing wistfully at the island, \"we've found the\r\nLake of the Skeezers and their Magic Isle. I guess the Skeezers are in\r\nthat big glass palace, but we can't get at 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8\r\n\r\nQueen Coo-ee-oh\r\n\r\n\r\nPrincess Ozma considered the situation gravely. Then she tied her\r\nhandkerchief to her wand and, standing at the water's edge, waved the\r\nhandkerchief like a flag, as a signal. For a time they could observe\r\nno response.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see what good that will do,\" said Dorothy. \"Even if the\r\nSkeezers are on that island and see us, and know we're friends, they\r\nhaven't any boats to come and get us.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Skeezers didn't need boats, as the girls soon discovered. For\r\non a sudden an opening appeared at the base of the palace and from the\r\nopening came a slender shaft of steel, reaching out slowly but\r\nsteadily across the water in the direction of the place where they\r\nstood. To the girls this steel arrangement looked like a triangle,\r\nwith the base nearest the water. It came toward them in the form of an\r\narch, stretching out from the palace wall until its end reached the\r\nbank and rested there, while the other end still remained on the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThen they saw that it was a bridge, consisting of a steel footway just\r\nbroad enough to walk on, and two slender guide rails, one on either\r\nside, which were connected with the footway by steel bars. The bridge\r\nlooked rather frail and Dorothy feared it would not bear their weight,\r\nbut Ozma at once called, \"Come on!\" and started to walk across,\r\nholding fast to the rail on either side. So Dorothy summoned her\r\ncourage and followed after. Before Ozma had taken three steps she\r\nhalted and so forced Dorothy to halt, for the bridge was again moving\r\nand returning to the island.\r\n\r\n\"We need not walk after all,\" said Ozma. So they stood still in their\r\nplaces and let the steel bridge draw them onward. Indeed, the bridge\r\ndrew them well into the glass-domed building which covered the island,\r\nand soon they found themselves standing in a marble room where two\r\nhandsomely dressed young men stood on a platform to receive them.\r\n\r\nOzma at once stepped from the end of the bridge to the marble\r\nplatform, followed by Dorothy, and then the bridge disappeared with a\r\nslight clang of steel and a marble slab covered the opening from which\r\nit had emerged.\r\n\r\nThe two young men bowed profoundly to Ozma, and one of them said:\r\n\r\n\"Queen Coo-ee-oh bids you welcome, O Strangers. Her Majesty is waiting\r\nto receive you in her palace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lead on,\" replied Ozma with dignity.\r\n\r\nBut instead of \"leading on,\" the platform of marble began to rise,\r\ncarrying them upward through a square hole above which just fitted it.\r\nA moment later they found themselves within the great glass dome that\r\ncovered almost all of the island.\r\n\r\nWithin this dome was a little village, with houses, streets, gardens\r\nand parks. The houses were of colored marbles, prettily designed, with\r\nmany stained-glass windows, and the streets and gardens seemed well\r\ncared for. Exactly under the center of the lofty dome was a small park\r\nfilled with brilliant flowers, with an elaborate fountain, and facing\r\nthis park stood a building larger and more imposing than the others.\r\nToward this building the young men escorted Ozma and Dorothy.\r\n\r\nOn the streets and in the doorways or open windows of the houses were\r\nmen, women and children, all richly dressed. These were much like\r\nother people in different parts of the Land of Oz, except that instead\r\nof seeming merry and contented they all wore expressions of much\r\nsolemnity or of nervous irritation. They had beautiful homes, splendid\r\nclothes, and ample food, but Dorothy at once decided something was\r\nwrong with their lives and that they were not happy. She said nothing,\r\nhowever, but looked curiously at the Skeezers.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the palace Ozma and Dorothy were met by two other\r\nyoung men, in uniform and armed with queer weapons that seemed about\r\nhalfway between pistols and guns, but were like neither. Their\r\nconductors bowed and left them, and the two in uniforms led the girls\r\ninto the palace.\r\n\r\nIn a beautiful throne room, surrounded by a dozen or more young men\r\nand women, sat the Queen of the Skeezers, Coo-ee-oh. She was a girl\r\nwho looked older than Ozma or Dorothy--fifteen or sixteen, at\r\nleast--and although she was elaborately dressed as if she were going\r\nto a ball she was too thin and plain of feature to be pretty. But\r\nevidently Queen Coo-ee-oh did not realize this fact, for her air and\r\nmanner betrayed her as proud and haughty and with a high regard for\r\nher own importance. Dorothy at once decided she was \"snippy\" and that\r\nshe would not like Queen Coo-ee-oh as a companion.\r\n\r\nThe Queen's hair was as black as her skin was white and her eyes were\r\nblack, too. The eyes, as she calmly examined Ozma and Dorothy, had a\r\nsuspicious and unfriendly look in them, but she said quietly:\r\n\r\n\"I know who you are, for I have consulted my Magic Oracle, which told\r\nme that one calls herself Princess Ozma, the Ruler of all the Land of\r\nOz, and the other is Princess Dorothy of Oz, who came from a country\r\ncalled Kansas. I know nothing of the Land of Oz, and I know nothing of\r\nKansas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, _this_ is the Land of Oz!\" cried Dorothy. \"It's a _part_ of the\r\nLand of Oz, anyhow, whether you know it or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, in-deed!\" answered Queen Coo-ee-oh, scornfully. \"I suppose you\r\nwill claim next that this Princess Ozma, ruling the Land of Oz, rules\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" returned Dorothy. \"There's no doubt of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen turned to Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"Do you dare make such a claim?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nBy this time Ozma had made up her mind as to the character of this\r\nhaughty and disdainful creature, whose self-pride evidently led her\r\nto believe herself superior to all others.\r\n\r\n\"I did not come here to quarrel with your Majesty,\" said the girl\r\nRuler of Oz, quietly. \"What and who I am is well established, and my\r\nauthority comes from the Fairy Queen Lurline, of whose band I was a\r\nmember when Lurline made all Oz a Fairyland. There are several\r\ncountries and several different peoples in this broad land, each of\r\nwhich has its separate rulers, Kings, Emperors and Queens. But all\r\nthese render obedience to my laws and acknowledge me as the supreme\r\nRuler.\"\r\n\r\n\"If other Kings and Queens are fools that does not interest me in the\r\nleast,\" replied Coo-ee-oh, disdainfully. \"In the Land of the Skeezers\r\nI alone am supreme. You are impudent to think I would defer to you--or\r\nto anyone else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us not speak of this now, please,\" answered Ozma. \"Your island is\r\nin danger, for a powerful foe is preparing to destroy it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pah! The Flatheads. I do not fear them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their Supreme Dictator is a Sorcerer.\"\r\n\r\n\"My magic is greater than his. Let the Flatheads come! They will never\r\nreturn to their barren mountain-top. I will see to that.\"\r\n\r\nOzma did not like this attitude, for it meant that the Skeezers were\r\neager to fight the Flatheads, and Ozma's object in coming here was to\r\nprevent fighting and induce the two quarrelsome neighbors to make\r\npeace. She was also greatly disappointed in Coo-ee-oh, for the reports\r\nof Su-dic had led her to imagine the Queen more just and honorable\r\nthan were the Flatheads. Indeed Ozma reflected that the girl might be\r\nbetter at heart than her self-pride and overbearing manner indicated,\r\nand in any event it would be wise not to antagonize her but to try to\r\nwin her friendship.\r\n\r\n\"I do not like wars, your Majesty,\" said Ozma. \"In the Emerald City,\r\nwhere I rule thousands of people, and in the countries near to the\r\nEmerald City, where thousands more acknowledge my rule, there is no\r\narmy at all, because there is no quarreling and no need to fight. If\r\ndifferences arise between my people, they come to me and I judge the\r\ncases and award justice to all. So, when I learned there might be war\r\nbetween two faraway people of Oz, I came here to settle the dispute\r\nand adjust the quarrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one asked you to come,\" declared Queen Coo-ee-oh. \"It is _my_\r\nbusiness to settle this dispute, not yours. You say my island is a\r\npart of the Land of Oz, which you rule, but that is all nonsense, for\r\nI've never heard of the Land of Oz, nor of you. You say you are a\r\nfairy, and that fairies gave you command over me. I don't believe it!\r\nWhat I _do_ believe is that you are an impostor and have come here to\r\nstir up trouble among my people, who are already becoming difficult to\r\nmanage. You two girls may even be spies of the vile Flatheads, for all\r\nI know, and may be trying to trick me. But understand this,\" she\r\nadded, proudly rising from her jeweled throne to confront them, \"I\r\nhave magic powers greater than any fairy possesses, and greater than\r\nany Flathead possesses. I am a Krumbic Witch--the only Krumbic Witch\r\nin the world--and I fear the magic of no other creature that exists!\r\nYou say you rule thousands. I rule one hundred and one Skeezers. But\r\nevery one of them trembles at my word. Now that Ozma of Oz and\r\nPrincess Dorothy are here, I shall rule one hundred and three\r\nsubjects, for you also shall bow before my power. More than that, in\r\nruling you I also rule the thousands you say you rule.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy was very indignant at this speech.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a pink kitten that sometimes talks like that,\" she said,\r\n\"but after I give her a good whipping she doesn't think she's so high\r\nand mighty after all. If you only knew who Ozma is you'd be scared to\r\ndeath to talk to her like that!\"\r\n\r\nQueen Coo-ee-oh gave the girl a supercilious look. Then she turned\r\nagain to Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"I happen to know,\" said she, \"that the Flatheads intend to attack us\r\ntomorrow, but we are ready for them. Until the battle is over, I shall\r\nkeep you two strangers prisoners on my island, from which there is no\r\nchance for you to escape.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned and looked around the band of courtiers who stood silently\r\naround her throne.\r\n\r\n\"Lady Aurex,\" she continued, singling out one of the young women,\r\n\"take these children to your house and care for them, giving them food\r\nand lodging. You may allow them to wander anywhere under the Great\r\nDome, for they are harmless. After I have attended to the Flatheads I\r\nwill consider what next to do with these foolish girls.\"\r\n\r\nShe resumed her seat and the Lady Aurex bowed low and said in a humble\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n\"I obey your Majesty's commands.\" Then to Ozma and Dorothy she added,\r\n\"Follow me,\" and turned to leave the throne room.\r\n\r\nDorothy looked to see what Ozma would do. To her surprise and a\r\nlittle to her disappointment Ozma turned and followed Lady Aurex. So\r\nDorothy trailed after them, but not without giving a parting, haughty\r\nlook toward Queen Coo-ee-oh, who had her face turned the other way and\r\ndid not see the disapproving look.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9\r\n\r\nLady Aurex\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Aurex led Ozma and Dorothy along a street to a pretty marble\r\nhouse near to one edge of the great glass dome that covered the\r\nvillage. She did not speak to the girls until she had ushered them\r\ninto a pleasant room, comfortably furnished, nor did any of the solemn\r\npeople they met on the street venture to speak.\r\n\r\nWhen they were seated Lady Aurex asked if they were hungry, and\r\nfinding they were summoned a maid and ordered food to be brought.\r\n\r\nThis Lady Aurex looked to be about twenty years old, although in the\r\nLand of Oz where people have never changed in appearance since the\r\nfairies made it a fairyland--where no one grows old or dies--it is\r\nalways difficult to say how many years anyone has lived. She had a\r\npleasant, attractive face, even though it was solemn and sad as the\r\nfaces of all Skeezers seemed to be, and her costume was rich and\r\nelaborate, as became a lady in waiting upon the Queen.\r\n\r\nOzma had observed Lady Aurex closely and now asked her in a gentle\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n\"Do you, also, believe me to be an impostor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare not say,\" replied Lady Aurex in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you afraid to speak freely?\" inquired Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"The Queen punishes us if we make remarks that she does not like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we not alone then, in this house?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Queen can hear everything that is spoken on this island--even the\r\nslightest whisper,\" declared Lady Aurex. \"She is a wonderful witch, as\r\nshe has told you, and it is folly to criticise her or disobey her\r\ncommands.\"\r\n\r\nOzma looked into her eyes and saw that she would like to say more if\r\nshe dared. So she drew from her bosom her silver wand, and having\r\nmuttered a magic phrase in a strange tongue, she left the room and\r\nwalked slowly around the outside of the house, making a complete\r\ncircle and waving her wand in mystic curves as she walked. Lady Aurex\r\nwatched her curiously and, when Ozma had again entered the room and\r\nseated herself, she asked:\r\n\r\n\"What have you done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've enchanted this house in such a manner that Queen Coo-ee-oh, with\r\nall her witchcraft, cannot hear one word we speak within the magic\r\ncircle I have made,\" replied Ozma. \"We may now speak freely and as\r\nloudly as we wish, without fear of the Queen's anger.\"\r\n\r\nLady Aurex brightened at this.\r\n\r\n\"Can I trust you?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Ev'rybody trusts Ozma,\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"She is true and honest,\r\nand your wicked Queen will be sorry she insulted the powerful Ruler of\r\nall the Land of Oz.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Queen does not know me yet,\" said Ozma, \"but I want you to know\r\nme, Lady Aurex, and I want you to tell me why you, and all the\r\nSkeezers, are unhappy. Do not fear Coo-ee-oh's anger, for she cannot\r\nhear a word we say, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\nLady Aurex was thoughtful a moment; then she said: \"I shall trust you,\r\nPrincess Ozma, for I believe you are what you say you are--our supreme\r\nRuler. If you knew the dreadful punishments our Queen inflicts upon\r\nus, you would not wonder we are so unhappy. The Skeezers are not bad\r\npeople; they do not care to quarrel and fight, even with their enemies\r\nthe Flatheads; but they are so cowed and fearful of Coo-ee-oh that\r\nthey obey her slightest word, rather than suffer her anger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't she any heart, then?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"She never displays mercy. She loves no one but herself,\" asserted\r\nLady Aurex, but she trembled as she said it, as if afraid even yet of\r\nher terrible Queen.\r\n\r\n\"That's pretty bad,\" said Dorothy, shaking her head gravely. \"I see\r\nyou've a lot to do here, Ozma, in this forsaken corner of the Land of\r\nOz. First place, you've got to take the magic away from Queen\r\nCoo-ee-oh, and from that awful Su-dic, too. _My_ idea is that neither\r\nof them is fit to rule anybody, 'cause they're cruel and hateful. So\r\nyou'll have to give the Skeezers and Flatheads new rulers and teach\r\nall their people that they're part of the Land of Oz and must obey,\r\nabove all, the lawful Ruler, Ozma of Oz. Then, when you've done that,\r\nwe can go back home again.\"\r\n\r\nOzma smiled at her little friend's earnest counsel, but Lady Aurex\r\nsaid in an anxious tone:\r\n\r\n\"I am surprised that you suggest these reforms while you are yet\r\nprisoners on this island and in Coo-ee-oh's power. That these things\r\nshould be done, there is no doubt, but just now a dreadful war is\r\nlikely to break out, and frightful things may happen to us all. Our\r\nQueen has such conceit that she thinks she can overcome the Su-dic and\r\nhis people, but it is said Su-dic's magic is very powerful, although\r\nnot as great as that possessed by his wife Rora, before Coo-ee-oh\r\ntransformed her into a Golden Pig.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't blame her very much for doing that,\" remarked Dorothy, \"for\r\nthe Flatheads were wicked to try to catch your beautiful fish and the\r\nWitch Rora wanted to poison all the fishes in the lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the reason?\" asked the Lady Aurex.\r\n\r\n\"I don't s'pose there _was_ any reason, 'cept just wickedness,\"\r\nreplied Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us the reason,\" said Ozma earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, your Majesty, once--a long time ago--the Flatheads and the\r\nSkeezers were friendly. They visited our island and we visited their\r\nmountain, and everything was pleasant between the two peoples. At that\r\ntime the Flatheads were ruled by three Adepts in Sorcery, beautiful\r\ngirls who were not Flatheads, but had wandered to the Flat Mountain\r\nand made their home there. These three Adepts used their magic only\r\nfor good, and the mountain people gladly made them their rulers. They\r\ntaught the Flatheads how to use their canned brains and how to work\r\nmetals into clothing that would never wear out, and many other things\r\nthat added to their happiness and content.\r\n\r\n\"Coo-ee-oh was our Queen then, as now, but she knew no magic and so\r\nhad nothing to be proud of. But the three Adepts were very kind to\r\nCoo-ee-oh. They built for us this wonderful dome of glass and our\r\nhouses of marble and taught us to make beautiful clothing and many\r\nother things. Coo-ee-oh pretended to be very grateful for these\r\nfavors, but it seems that all the time she was jealous of the three\r\nAdepts and secretly tried to discover their arts of magic. In this\r\nshe was more clever than anyone suspected. She invited the three\r\nAdepts to a banquet one day, and while they were feasting Coo-ee-oh\r\nstole their charms and magical instruments and transformed them into\r\nthree fishes--a gold fish, a silver fish and a bronze fish. While the\r\npoor fishes were gasping and flopping helplessly on the floor of the\r\nbanquet room one of them said reproachfully: 'You will be punished for\r\nthis, Coo-ee-oh, for if one of us dies or is destroyed, you will\r\nbecome shrivelled and helpless, and all your stolen magic will depart\r\nfrom you.' Frightened by this threat, Coo-ee-oh at once caught up the\r\nthree fish and ran with them to the shore of the lake, where she cast\r\nthem into the water. This revived the three Adepts and they swam away\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"I, myself, witnessed this shocking scene,\" continued Lady Aurex, \"and\r\nso did many other Skeezers. The news was carried to the Flatheads, who\r\nthen turned from friends to enemies. The Su-dic and his wife Rora were\r\nthe only ones on the mountain who were glad the three Adepts had been\r\nlost to them, and they at once became Rulers of the Flatheads and\r\nstole their canned brains from others to make themselves the more\r\npowerful. Some of the Adepts' magic tools had been left on the\r\nmountain, and these Rora seized and by the use of them she became a\r\nwitch.\r\n\r\n\"The result of Coo-ee-oh's treachery was to make both the Skeezers and\r\nthe Flatheads miserable instead of happy. Not only were the Su-dic and\r\nhis wife cruel to their people, but our Queen at once became proud and\r\narrogant and treated us very unkindly. All the Skeezers knew she had\r\nstolen her magic powers and so she hated us and made us humble\r\nourselves before her and obey her slightest word. If we disobeyed, or\r\ndid not please her, or if we talked about her when we were in our own\r\nhomes she would have us dragged to the whipping post in her palace and\r\nlashed with knotted cords. That is why we fear her so greatly.\"\r\n\r\nThis story filled Ozma's heart with sorrow and Dorothy's heart with\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n\"I now understand,\" said Ozma, \"why the fishes in the lake have\r\nbrought about war between the Skeezers and the Flatheads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Lady Aurex answered, \"now that you know the story it is easy to\r\nunderstand. The Su-dic and his wife came to our lake hoping to catch\r\nthe silver fish, or gold fish, or bronze fish--any one of them _would_\r\ndo--and by destroying it deprive Coo-ee-oh of her magic. Then they\r\ncould easily conquer her. Also they had another reason for wanting to\r\ncatch the fish--they feared that in some way the three Adepts might\r\nregain their proper forms and then they would be sure to return to the\r\nmountain and punish Rora and the Su-dic. That was why Rora finally\r\ntried to poison all the fishes in the lake, at the time Coo-ee-oh\r\ntransformed her into a Golden Pig. Of course this attempt to destroy\r\nthe fishes frightened the Queen, for her safety lies in keeping the\r\nthree fishes alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose Coo-ee-oh will fight the Flatheads with all her might,\"\r\nobserved Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"And with all her magic,\" added Ozma, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I do not see how the Flatheads can get to this island to hurt us,\"\r\nsaid Lady Aurex.\r\n\r\n\"They have bows and arrows, and I guess they mean to shoot the arrows\r\nat your big dome, and break all the glass in it,\" suggested Dorothy.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Aurex shook her head with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"They cannot do that,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare not tell you why, but if the Flatheads come to-morrow morning\r\nyou will yourselves see the reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think they will attempt to harm the island,\" Ozma declared.\r\n\"I believe they will first attempt to destroy the fishes, by poison\r\nor some other means. If they succeed in that, the conquest of the\r\nisland will not be difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have no boats,\" said Lady Aurex, \"and Coo-ee-oh, who has long\r\nexpected this war, has been preparing for it in many astonishing ways.\r\nI almost wish the Flatheads would conquer us, for then we would be\r\nfree from our dreadful Queen; but I do not wish to see the three\r\ntransformed fishes destroyed, for in them lies our only hope of future\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ozma will take care of you, whatever happens,\" Dorothy assured her.\r\nBut the Lady Aurex, not knowing the extent of Ozma's power--which was,\r\nin fact, not so great as Dorothy imagined--could not take much comfort\r\nin this promise.\r\n\r\nIt was evident there would be exciting times on the morrow, if the\r\nFlatheads really attacked the Skeezers of the Magic Isle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10\r\n\r\nUnder Water\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen night fell all the interior of the Great Dome, streets and\r\nhouses, became lighted with brilliant incandescent lamps, which\r\nrendered it bright as day. Dorothy thought the island must look\r\nbeautiful by night from the outer shore of the lake. There was revelry\r\nand feasting in the Queen's palace, and the music of the royal band\r\ncould be plainly heard in Lady Aurex's house, where Ozma and Dorothy\r\nremained with their hostess and keeper. They were prisoners, but\r\ntreated with much consideration.\r\n\r\nLady Aurex gave them a nice supper and when they wished to retire\r\nshowed them to a pretty room with comfortable beds and wished them a\r\ngood night and pleasant dreams.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of all this, Ozma?\" Dorothy anxiously inquired when\r\nthey were alone.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad we came,\" was the reply, \"for although there may be\r\nmischief done to-morrow, it was necessary I should know about these\r\npeople, whose leaders are wild and lawless and oppress their subjects\r\nwith injustice and cruelties. My task, therefore, is to liberate the\r\nSkeezers and the Flatheads and secure for them freedom and happiness.\r\nI have no doubt I can accomplish this in time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just now, though, we're in a bad fix,\" asserted Dorothy. \"If Queen\r\nCoo-ee-oh conquers to-morrow, she won't be nice to us, and if the\r\nSu-dic conquers, he'll be worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not worry, dear,\" said Ozma, \"I do not think we are in danger,\r\nwhatever happens, and the result of our adventure is sure to be good.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy was not worrying, especially. She had confidence in her\r\nfriend, the fairy Princess of Oz, and she enjoyed the excitement of\r\nthe events in which she was taking part. So she crept into bed and\r\nfell asleep as easily as if she had been in her own cosy room in\r\nOzma's palace.\r\n\r\nA sort of grating, grinding sound awakened her. The whole island\r\nseemed to tremble and sway, as it might do in an earthquake. Dorothy\r\nsat up in bed, rubbing her eyes to get the sleep out of them, and then\r\nfound it was daybreak.\r\n\r\nOzma was hurriedly dressing herself.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Dorothy, jumping out of bed.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" answered Ozma \"but it feels as if the island is\r\nsinking.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible they finished dressing, while the creaking and\r\nswaying continued. Then they rushed into the living room of the house\r\nand found Lady Aurex, fully dressed, awaiting them.\r\n\r\n\"Do not be alarmed,\" said their hostess. \"Coo-ee-oh has decided to\r\nsubmerge the island, that is all. But it proves the Flatheads are\r\ncoming to attack us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by sub-sub-merging the island?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Come here and see,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nLady Aurex led them to a window which faced the side of the great dome\r\nwhich covered all the village, and they could see that the island was\r\nindeed sinking, for the water of the lake was already half way up the\r\nside of the dome. Through the glass could be seen swimming fishes, and\r\ntall stalks of swaying seaweeds, for the water was clear as crystal\r\nand through it they could distinguish even the farther shore of the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n\"The Flatheads are not here yet,\" said Lady Aurex. \"They will come\r\nsoon, but not until all of this dome is under the surface of the\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't the dome leak?\" Dorothy inquired anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the island ever sub-sub-sunk before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; on several occasions. But Coo-ee-oh doesn't care to do that\r\noften, for it requires a lot of hard work to operate the machinery.\r\nThe dome was built so that the island could disappear. I think,\" she\r\ncontinued, \"that our Queen fears the Flatheads will attack the island\r\nand try to break the glass of the dome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if we're under water, they can't fight us, and we can't fight\r\nthem,\" asserted Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"They could kill the fishes, however,\" said Ozma gravely.\r\n\r\n\"We have ways to fight, also, even though our island is under water,\"\r\nclaimed Lady Aurex. \"I cannot tell you all our secrets, but this\r\nisland is full of surprises. Also our Queen's magic is astonishing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she steal it all from the three Adepts in Sorcery that are now\r\nfishes?\"\r\n\r\n\"She stole the knowledge and the magic tools, but she has used them as\r\nthe three Adepts never would have done.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the top of the dome was quite under water and suddenly\r\nthe island stopped sinking and became stationary.\r\n\r\n\"See!\" cried Lady Aurex, pointing to the shore. \"The Flatheads have\r\ncome.\"\r\n\r\nOn the bank, which was now far above their heads, a crowd of dark\r\nfigures could be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Now let us see what Coo-ee-oh will do to oppose them,\" continued Lady\r\nAurex, in a voice that betrayed her excitement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Flatheads, pushing their way through the line of palm trees, had\r\nreached the shore of the lake just as the top of the island's dome\r\ndisappeared beneath the surface. The water now flowed from shore to\r\nshore, but through the clear water the dome was still visible and the\r\nhouses of the Skeezers could be dimly seen through the panes of glass.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" exclaimed the Su-dic, who had armed all his followers and had\r\nbrought with him two copper vessels, which he carefully set down upon\r\nthe ground beside him. \"If Coo-ee-oh wants to hide instead of\r\nfighting our job will be easy, for in one of these copper vessels I\r\nhave enough poison to kill every fish in the lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kill them, then, while we have time, and then we can go home again,\"\r\nadvised one of the chief officers.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" objected the Su-dic. \"The Queen of the Skeezers has defied\r\nme, and I want to get her into my power, as well as to destroy her\r\nmagic. She transformed my poor wife into a Golden Pig, and I must have\r\nrevenge for that, whatever else we do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" suddenly exclaimed the officers, pointing into the lake;\r\n\"something's going to happen.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the submerged dome a door opened and something black shot swiftly\r\nout into the water. The door instantly closed behind it and the dark\r\nobject cleaved its way through the water, without rising to the\r\nsurface, directly toward the place where the Flatheads were standing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" Dorothy asked the Lady Aurex.\r\n\r\n\"That is one of the Queen's submarines,\" was the reply. \"It is all\r\nenclosed, and can move under water. Coo-ee-oh has several of these\r\nboats which are kept in little rooms in the basement under our\r\nvillage. When the island is submerged, the Queen uses these boats to\r\nreach the shore, and I believe she now intends to fight the Flatheads\r\nwith them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Su-dic and his people knew nothing of Coo-ee-oh's submarines, so\r\nthey watched with surprise as the under-water boat approached them.\r\nWhen it was quite near the shore it rose to the surface and the top\r\nparted and fell back, disclosing a boat full of armed Skeezers. At the\r\nhead was the Queen, standing up in the bow and holding in one hand a\r\ncoil of magic rope that gleamed like silver.\r\n\r\nThe boat halted and Coo-ee-oh drew back her arm to throw the silver\r\nrope toward the Su-dic, who was now but a few feet from her. But the\r\nwily Flathead leader quickly realized his danger and before the Queen\r\ncould throw the rope he caught up one of the copper vessels and dashed\r\nits contents full in her face!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11\r\n\r\nThe Conquest of the Skeezers\r\n\r\n\r\nQueen Coo-ee-oh dropped the rope, tottered and fell headlong into the\r\nwater, sinking beneath the surface, while the Skeezers in the\r\nsubmarine were too bewildered to assist her and only stared at the\r\nripples in the water where she had disappeared. A moment later there\r\narose to the surface a beautiful White Swan. This Swan was of large\r\nsize, very gracefully formed, and scattered all over its white\r\nfeathers were tiny diamonds, so thickly placed that as the rays of the\r\nmorning sun fell upon them the entire body of the Swan glistened like\r\none brilliant diamond. The head of the Diamond Swan had a bill of\r\npolished gold and its eyes were two sparkling amethysts.\r\n\r\n\"Hooray!\" cried the Su-dic, dancing up and down with wicked glee. \"My\r\npoor wife, Rora, is avenged at last. You made her a Golden Pig,\r\nCoo-ee-oh, and now I have made you a Diamond Swan. Float on your lake\r\nforever, if you like, for your web feet can do no more magic and you\r\nare as powerless as the Pig you made of my wife!\"\r\n\r\n\"Villain! Scoundrel!\" croaked the Diamond Swan. \"You will be punished\r\nfor this. Oh, what a fool I was to let you enchant me!\"\r\n\r\n\"A fool you were, and a fool you are!\" laughed the Su-dic, dancing\r\nmadly in his delight. And then he carelessly tipped over the other\r\ncopper vessel with his heel and its contents spilled on the sands and\r\nwere lost to the last drop.\r\n\r\nThe Su-dic stopped short and looked at the overturned vessel with a\r\nrueful countenance.\r\n\r\n\"That's too bad--too bad!\" he exclaimed sorrowfully. \"I've lost all\r\nthe poison I had to kill the fishes with, and I can't make any more\r\nbecause only my wife knew the secret of it, and she is now a foolish\r\nPig and has forgotten all her magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the Diamond Swan scornfully, as she floated upon the\r\nwater and swam gracefully here and there. \"I'm glad to see you are\r\nfoiled. Your punishment is just beginning, for although you have\r\nenchanted me and taken away my powers of sorcery you have still the\r\nthree magic fishes to deal with, and they'll destroy you in time, mark\r\nmy words.\"\r\n\r\nThe Su-dic stared at the Swan a moment. Then he yelled to his men:\r\n\r\n\"Shoot her! Shoot the saucy bird!\"\r\n\r\nThey let fly some arrows at the Diamond Swan, but she dove under the\r\nwater and the missiles fell harmless. When Coo-ee-oh rose to the\r\nsurface she was far from the shore and she swiftly swam across the\r\nlake to where no arrows or spears could reach her.\r\n\r\nThe Su-dic rubbed his chin and thought what to do next. Near by\r\nfloated the submarine in which the Queen had come, but the Skeezers\r\nwho were in it were puzzled what to do with themselves. Perhaps they\r\nwere not sorry their cruel mistress had been transformed into a\r\nDiamond Swan, but the transformation had left them quite helpless. The\r\nunder-water boat was not operated by machinery, but by certain mystic\r\nwords uttered by Coo-ee-oh. They didn't know how to submerge it, or\r\nhow to make the water-tight shield cover them again, or how to make\r\nthe boat go back to the castle, or make it enter the little basement\r\nroom where it was usually kept. As a matter of fact, they were now\r\nshut out of their village under the Great Dome and could not get back\r\nagain. So one of the men called to the Supreme Dictator of the\r\nFlatheads, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Please make us prisoners and take us to your mountain, and feed and\r\nkeep us, for we have nowhere to go.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Su-dic laughed and answered:\r\n\r\n\"Not so. I can't be bothered by caring for a lot of stupid Skeezers.\r\nStay where you are, or go wherever you please, so long as you keep\r\naway from our mountain.\" He turned to his men and added: \"We have\r\nconquered Queen Coo-ee-oh and made her a helpless swan. The Skeezers\r\nare under water and may stay there. So, having won the war, let us go\r\nhome again and make merry and feast, having after many years proved\r\nthe Flatheads to be greater and more powerful than the Skeezers.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Flatheads marched away and passed through the row of palms and\r\nwent back to their mountain, where the Su-dic and a few of his\r\nofficers feasted and all the others were forced to wait on them.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry we couldn't have roast pig,\" said the Su-dic, \"but as the\r\nonly pig we have is made of gold, we can't eat her. Also the Golden\r\nPig happens to be my wife, and even were she not gold I am sure she\r\nwould be too tough to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12\r\n\r\nThe Diamond Swan\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Flatheads had gone away the Diamond Swan swam back to the\r\nboat and one of the young Skeezers named Ervic said to her eagerly:\r\n\r\n\"How can we get back to the island, your Majesty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I not beautiful?\" asked Coo-ee-oh, arching her neck gracefully and\r\nspreading her diamond-sprinkled wings. \"I can see my reflection in the\r\nwater, and I'm sure there is no bird nor beast, nor human as\r\nmagnificent as I am!\"\r\n\r\n\"How shall we get back to the island, your Majesty?\" pleaded Ervic.\r\n\r\n\"When my fame spreads throughout the land, people will travel from all\r\nparts of this lake to look upon my loveliness,\" said Coo-ee-oh,\r\nshaking her feathers to make the diamonds glitter more brilliantly.\r\n\r\n\"But, your Majesty, we must go home and we do not know how to get\r\nthere,\" Ervic persisted.\r\n\r\n\"My eyes,\" remarked the Diamond Swan, \"are wonderfully blue and bright\r\nand will charm all beholders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us how to make the boat go--how to get back into the island,\"\r\nbegged Ervic and the others cried just as earnestly: \"Tell us,\r\nCoo-ee-oh; tell us!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied the Queen in a careless tone.\r\n\r\n\"You are a magic-worker, a sorceress, a witch!\"\r\n\r\n\"I was, of course, when I was a girl,\" she said, bending her head over\r\nthe clear water to catch her reflection in it; \"but now I've\r\nforgotten all such foolish things as magic. Swans are lovelier than\r\ngirls, especially when they're sprinkled with diamonds. Don't you\r\nthink so?\" And she gracefully swam away, without seeming to care\r\nwhether they answered or not.\r\n\r\nErvic and his companions were in despair. They saw plainly that\r\nCoo-ee-oh could not or would not help them. The former Queen had no\r\nfurther thought for her island, her people, or her wonderful magic;\r\nshe was only intent on admiring her own beauty.\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" said Ervic, in a gloomy voice, \"the Flatheads have conquered\r\nus!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome of these events had been witnessed by Ozma and Dorothy and Lady\r\nAurex, who had left the house and gone close to the glass of the dome,\r\nin order to see what was going on. Many of the Skeezers had also\r\ncrowded against the dome, wondering what would happen next. Although\r\ntheir vision was to an extent blurred by the water and the necessity\r\nof looking upward at an angle, they had observed the main points of\r\nthe drama enacted above. They saw Queen Coo-ee-oh's submarine come to\r\nthe surface and open; they saw the Queen standing erect to throw her\r\nmagic rope; they saw her sudden transformation into a Diamond Swan,\r\nand a cry of amazement went up from the Skeezers inside the dome.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"I hate that old Su-dic, but I'm glad\r\nCoo-ee-oh is punished.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a dreadful misfortune!\" cried Lady Aurex, pressing her hands\r\nupon her heart.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed Ozma, nodding her head thoughtfully; \"Coo-ee-oh's\r\nmisfortune will prove a terrible blow to her people.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked Dorothy in surprise. \"Seems to _me_\r\nthe Skeezers are in luck to lose their cruel Queen.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that were all you would be right,\" responded Lady Aurex; \"and if\r\nthe island were above water it would not be so serious. But here we\r\nall are, at the bottom of the lake, and fast prisoners in this dome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you raise the island?\" inquired Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"No. Only Coo-ee-oh knew how to do that,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"We can try,\" insisted Dorothy. \"If it can be made to go down, it can\r\nbe made to come up. The machinery is still here, I suppose.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but the machinery works by magic, and Coo-ee-oh would never\r\nshare her secret power with any one of us.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy's face grew grave; but she was thinking.\r\n\r\n\"Ozma knows a lot of magic,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"But not that kind of magic,\" Ozma replied.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you learn how, by looking at the machinery?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not, my dear. It isn't fairy magic at all; it is\r\nwitchcraft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Dorothy, turning to Lady Aurex, \"you say there are other\r\nsub-sub-sinking boats. We can get in one of those, and shoot out to\r\nthe top of the water, like Coo-ee-oh did, and so escape. And then we\r\ncan help to rescue all the Skeezers down here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one knows how to work the under-water boats but the Queen,\"\r\ndeclared Lady Aurex.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there any door or window in this dome that we could open?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; and, if there were, the water would rush in to flood the dome,\r\nand we could not get out.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Skeezers,\" said Ozma, \"could not drown; they only get wet and\r\nsoggy and in that condition they would be very uncomfortable and\r\nunhappy. But _you_ are a mortal girl, Dorothy, and if your Magic Belt\r\nprotected you from death you would have to lie forever at the bottom\r\nof the lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'd rather die quickly,\" asserted the little girl. \"But there\r\nare doors in the basement that open--to let out the bridges and the\r\nboats--and that would not flood the dome, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those doors open by a magic word, and only Coo-ee-oh knows the word\r\nthat must be uttered,\" said Lady Aurex.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed Dorothy, \"that dreadful Queen's witchcraft upsets\r\nall my plans to escape. I guess I'll give it up, Ozma, and let _you_\r\nsave us.\"\r\n\r\nOzma smiled, but her smile was not so cheerful as usual. The Princess\r\nof Oz found herself confronted with a serious problem, and although\r\nshe had no thought of despairing she realized that the Skeezers and\r\ntheir island, as well as Dorothy and herself, were in grave trouble\r\nand that unless she could find a means to save them they would be lost\r\nto the Land of Oz for all future time.\r\n\r\n\"In such a dilemma,\" said she, musingly, \"nothing is gained by haste.\r\nCareful thought may aid us, and so may the course of events. The\r\nunexpected is always likely to happen, and cheerful patience is better\r\nthan reckless action.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" returned Dorothy; \"take your time, Ozma; there's no\r\nhurry. How about some breakfast, Lady Aurex?\"\r\n\r\nTheir hostess led them back to the house, where she ordered her\r\ntrembling servants to prepare and serve breakfast. All the Skeezers\r\nwere frightened and anxious over the transformation of their Queen\r\ninto a swan. Coo-ee-oh was feared and hated, but they had depended on\r\nher magic to conquer the Flatheads and she was the only one who could\r\nraise their island to the surface of the lake again.\r\n\r\nBefore breakfast was over several of the leading Skeezers came to\r\nAurex to ask her advice and to question Princess Ozma, of whom they\r\nknew nothing except that she claimed to be a fairy and the Ruler of\r\nall the land, including the Lake of the Skeezers.\r\n\r\n\"If what you told Queen Coo-ee-oh was the truth,\" they said to her,\r\n\"you are our lawful mistress, and we may depend on you to get us out\r\nof our difficulties.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try to do that,\" Ozma graciously assured them, \"but you must\r\nremember that the powers of fairies are granted them to bring comfort\r\nand happiness to all who appeal to them. On the contrary, such magic\r\nas Coo-ee-oh knew and practiced is unlawful witchcraft and her arts\r\nare such as no fairy would condescend to use. However, it is sometimes\r\nnecessary to consider evil in order to accomplish good, and perhaps by\r\nstudying Coo-ee-oh's tools and charms of witchcraft I may be able to\r\nsave us. Do you promise to accept me as your Ruler and to obey my\r\ncommands?\"\r\n\r\nThey promised willingly.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Ozma, \"I will go to Coo-ee-oh's palace and take\r\npossession of it. Perhaps what I find there will be of use to me. In\r\nthe meantime tell all the Skeezers to fear nothing, but have patience.\r\nLet them return to their homes and perform their daily tasks as usual.\r\nCoo-ee-oh's loss may not prove a misfortune, but rather a blessing.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech cheered the Skeezers amazingly. Really, they had no one\r\nnow to depend upon but Ozma, and in spite of their dangerous position\r\ntheir hearts were lightened by the transformation and absence of their\r\ncruel Queen.\r\n\r\nThey got out their brass band and a grand procession escorted Ozma and\r\nDorothy to the palace, where all of Coo-ee-oh's former servants were\r\neager to wait upon them. Ozma invited Lady Aurex to stay at the palace\r\nalso, for she knew all about the Skeezers and their island and had\r\nalso been a favorite of the former Queen, so her advice and\r\ninformation were sure to prove valuable.\r\n\r\nOzma was somewhat disappointed in what she found in the palace. One\r\nroom of Coo-ee-oh's private suite was entirely devoted to the practice\r\nof witchcraft, and here were countless queer instruments and jars of\r\nointments and bottles of potions labeled with queer names, and strange\r\nmachines that Ozma could not guess the use of, and pickled toads and\r\nsnails and lizards, and a shelf of books that were written in blood,\r\nbut in a language which the Ruler of Oz did not know.\r\n\r\n\"I do not see,\" said Ozma to Dorothy, who accompanied her in her\r\nsearch, \"how Coo-ee-oh knew the use of the magic tools she stole from\r\nthe three Adept Witches. Moreover, from all reports these Adepts\r\npracticed only good witchcraft, such as would be helpful to their\r\npeople, while Coo-ee-oh performed only evil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps she turned the good things to evil uses?\" suggested Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and with the knowledge she gained Coo-ee-oh doubtless invented\r\nmany evil things quite unknown to the good Adepts, who are now\r\nfishes,\" added Ozma. \"It is unfortunate for us that the Queen kept her\r\nsecrets so closely guarded, for no one but herself could use any of\r\nthese strange things gathered in this room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we capture the Diamond Swan and make her tell the secrets?\"\r\nasked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"No; even were we able to capture her, Coo-ee-oh now has forgotten all\r\nthe magic she ever knew. But until we ourselves escape from this dome\r\nwe could not capture the Swan, and were we to escape we would have no\r\nuse for Coo-ee-oh's magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a fact,\" admitted Dorothy. \"But--say, Ozma, here's a good\r\nidea! Couldn't we capture the three fishes--the gold and silver and\r\nbronze ones, and couldn't you transform 'em back to their own shapes,\r\nand then couldn't the three Adepts get us out of here?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not very practical, Dorothy dear. It would be as hard for us\r\nto capture the three fishes, from among all the other fishes in the\r\nlake, as to capture the Swan.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if we could, it would be more help to us,\" persisted the little\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" answered Ozma, smiling at her friend's eagerness. \"You\r\nfind a way to catch the fish, and I'll promise when they are caught to\r\nrestore them to their proper forms.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you think I can't do it,\" replied Dorothy, \"but I'm going to\r\ntry.\"\r\n\r\nShe left the palace and went to a place where she could look through a\r\nclear pane of the glass dome into the surrounding water. Immediately\r\nshe became interested in the queer sights that met her view.\r\n\r\nThe Lake of the Skeezers was inhabited by fishes of many kinds and\r\nmany sizes. The water was so transparent that the girl could see for a\r\nlong distance and the fishes came so close to the glass of the dome\r\nthat sometimes they actually touched it. On the white sands at the\r\nbottom of the lake were star-fish, lobsters, crabs and many shell fish\r\nof strange shapes and with shells of gorgeous hues. The water foliage\r\nwas of brilliant colors and to Dorothy it resembled a splendid garden.\r\n\r\nBut the fishes were the most interesting of all. Some were big and\r\nlazy, floating slowly along or lying at rest with just their fins\r\nwaving. Many with big round eyes looked full at the girl as she\r\nwatched them and Dorothy wondered if they could hear her through the\r\nglass if she spoke to them. In Oz, where all the animals and birds can\r\ntalk, many fishes are able to talk also, but usually they are more\r\nstupid than birds and animals because they think slowly and haven't\r\nmuch to talk about.\r\n\r\nIn the Lake of the Skeezers the fish of smaller size were more active\r\nthan the big ones and darted quickly in and out among the swaying\r\nweeds, as if they had important business and were in a hurry. It was\r\namong the smaller varieties that Dorothy hoped to spy the gold and\r\nsilver and bronze fishes. She had an idea the three would keep\r\ntogether, being companions now as they were in their natural forms,\r\nbut such a multitude of fishes constantly passed, the scene shifting\r\nevery moment, that she was not sure she would notice them even if they\r\nappeared in view. Her eyes couldn't look in all directions and the\r\nfishes she sought might be on the other side of the dome, or far away\r\nin the lake.\r\n\r\n\"P'raps, because they were afraid of Coo-ee-oh, they've hid themselves\r\nsomewhere, and don't know their enemy has been transformed,\" she\r\nreflected.\r\n\r\nShe watched the fishes for a long time, until she became hungry and\r\nwent back to the palace for lunch. But she was not discouraged.\r\n\r\n\"Anything new, Ozma?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, dear. Did you discover the three fishes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. But there isn't anything better for me to do, Ozma, so I\r\nguess I'll go back and watch again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13\r\n\r\nThe Alarm Bell\r\n\r\n\r\nGlinda, the Good, in her palace in the Quadling Country, had many\r\nthings to occupy her mind, for not only did she look after the weaving\r\nand embroidery of her bevy of maids, and assist all those who came to\r\nher to implore her help--beasts and birds as well as people--but she\r\nwas a close student of the arts of sorcery and spent much time in her\r\nMagical Laboratory, where she strove to find a remedy for every evil\r\nand to perfect her skill in magic.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she did not forget to look in the Great Book of Records\r\neach day to see if any mention was made of the visit of Ozma and\r\nDorothy to the Enchanted Mountain of the Flatheads and the Magic Isle\r\nof the Skeezers. The Records told her that Ozma had arrived at the\r\nmountain, that she had escaped, with her companion, and gone to the\r\nisland of the Skeezers, and that Queen Coo-ee-oh had submerged the\r\nisland so that it was entirely under water. Then came the statement\r\nthat the Flatheads had come to the lake to poison the fishes and that\r\ntheir Supreme Dictator had transformed Queen Coo-ee-oh into a swan.\r\n\r\nNo other details were given in the Great Book and so Glinda did not\r\nknow that since Coo-ee-oh had forgotten her magic none of the Skeezers\r\nknew how to raise the island to the surface again. So Glinda was not\r\nworried about Ozma and Dorothy until one morning, while she sat with\r\nher maids, there came a sudden clang of the great alarm bell. This was\r\nso unusual that every maid gave a start and even the Sorceress for a\r\nmoment could not think what the alarm meant.\r\n\r\nThen she remembered the ring she had given Dorothy when she left the\r\npalace to start on her venture. In giving the ring Glinda had warned\r\nthe little girl not to use its magic powers unless she and Ozma were\r\nin real danger, but then she was to turn it on her finger once to the\r\nright and once to the left and Glinda's alarm bell would ring.\r\n\r\nSo the Sorceress now knew that danger threatened her beloved Ruler and\r\nPrincess Dorothy, and she hurried to her magic room to seek\r\ninformation as to what sort of danger it was. The answer to her\r\nquestion was not very satisfactory, for it was only: \"Ozma and Dorothy\r\nare prisoners in the great Dome of the Isle of the Skeezers, and the\r\nDome is under the water of the lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't Ozma the power to raise the island to the surface?\" inquired\r\nGlinda.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was the reply, and the Record refused to say more except that\r\nQueen Coo-ee-oh, who alone could command the island to rise, had been\r\ntransformed by the Flathead Su-dic into a Diamond Swan.\r\n\r\nThen Glinda consulted the past records of the Skeezers in the Great\r\nBook. After diligent search she discovered that Coo-ee-oh was a\r\npowerful sorceress, who had gained most of her power by treacherously\r\ntransforming the Adepts of Magic, who were visiting her, into three\r\nfishes--gold, silver and bronze--after which she had them cast into\r\nthe lake.\r\n\r\nGlinda reflected earnestly on this information and decided that\r\nsomeone must go to Ozma's assistance. While there was no great need of\r\nhaste, because Ozma and Dorothy could live in a submerged dome a long\r\ntime, it was evident they could not get out until someone was able to\r\nraise the island.\r\n\r\nThe Sorceress looked through all her recipes and books of sorcery, but\r\ncould find no magic that would raise a sunken island. Such a thing had\r\nnever before been required in sorcery. Then Glinda made a little\r\nisland, covered by a glass dome, and sunk it in a pond near her\r\ncastle, and experimented in magical ways to bring it to the surface.\r\nShe made several such experiments, but all were failures. It seemed a\r\nsimple thing to do, yet she could not do it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the wise Sorceress did not despair of finding a way to\r\nliberate her friends. Finally she concluded that the best thing to do\r\nwas to go to the Skeezer country and examine the lake. While there she\r\nwas more likely to discover a solution to the problem that bothered\r\nher, and to work out a plan for the rescue of Ozma and Dorothy.\r\n\r\nSo Glinda summoned her storks and her aerial chariot, and telling her\r\nmaids she was going on a journey and might not soon return, she\r\nentered the chariot and was carried swiftly to the Emerald City.\r\n\r\nIn Princess Ozma's palace the Scarecrow was now acting as Ruler of the\r\nLand of Oz. There wasn't much for him to do, because all the affairs\r\nof state moved so smoothly, but he was there in case anything\r\nunforeseen should happen.\r\n\r\nGlinda found the Scarecrow playing croquet with Trot and Betsy Bobbin,\r\ntwo little girls who lived at the palace under Ozma's protection and\r\nwere great friends of Dorothy and much loved by all the Oz people.\r\n\r\n\"Something's happened!\" cried Trot, as the chariot of the Sorceress\r\ndescended near them. \"Glinda never comes here 'cept something's gone\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope no harm has come to Ozma, or Dorothy,\" said Betsy anxiously,\r\nas the lovely Sorceress stepped down from her chariot.\r\n\r\nGlinda approached the Scarecrow and told him of the dilemma of Ozma\r\nand Dorothy and she added: \"We must save them, somehow, Scarecrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" replied the Scarecrow, stumbling over a wicket and\r\nfalling flat on his painted face.\r\n\r\nThe girls picked him up and patted his straw stuffing into shape, and\r\nhe continued, as if nothing had occurred: \"But you'll have to tell me\r\nwhat to do, for I never have raised a sunken island in all my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must have a Council of State as soon as possible,\" proposed the\r\nSorceress. \"Please send messengers to summon all of Ozma's counsellors\r\nto this palace. Then we can decide what is best to be done.\"\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow lost no time in doing this. Fortunately most of the\r\nroyal counsellors were in the Emerald City or near to it, so they all\r\nmet in the throne room of the palace that same evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14\r\n\r\nOzma's Counsellors\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Ruler ever had such a queer assortment of advisers as the Princess\r\nOzma had gathered about her throne. Indeed, in no other country could\r\nsuch amazing people exist. But Ozma loved them for their\r\npeculiarities and could trust every one of them.\r\n\r\nFirst there was the Tin Woodman. Every bit of him was tin, brightly\r\npolished. All his joints were kept well oiled and moved smoothly. He\r\ncarried a gleaming axe to prove he was a woodman, but seldom had cause\r\nto use it because he lived in a magnificent tin castle in the Winkie\r\nCountry of Oz and was the Emperor of all the Winkies. The Tin\r\nWoodman's name was Nick Chopper. He had a very good mind, but his\r\nheart was not of much account, so he was very careful to do nothing\r\nunkind or to hurt anyone's feelings.\r\n\r\nAnother counsellor was Scraps, the Patchwork Girl of Oz, who was made\r\nof a gaudy patchwork quilt, cut into shape and stuffed with cotton.\r\nThis Patchwork Girl was very intelligent, but so full of fun and mad\r\npranks that a lot of more stupid folks thought she must be crazy.\r\nScraps was jolly under all conditions, however grave they might be,\r\nbut her laughter and good spirits were of value in cheering others and\r\nin her seemingly careless remarks much wisdom could often be found.\r\n\r\nThen there was the Shaggy Man--shaggy from head to foot, hair and\r\nwhiskers, clothes and shoes--but very kind and gentle and one of\r\nOzma's most loyal supporters.\r\n\r\nTik-Tok was there, a copper man with machinery inside him, so cleverly\r\nconstructed that he moved, spoke and thought by three separate\r\nclock-works. Tik-Tok was very reliable because he always did exactly\r\nwhat he was wound up to do, but his machinery was liable to run down\r\nat times and then he was quite helpless until wound up again.\r\n\r\nA different sort of person was Jack Pumpkinhead, one of Ozma's oldest\r\nfriends and her companion on many adventures. Jack's body was very\r\ncrude and awkward, being formed of limbs of trees of different sizes,\r\njointed with wooden pegs. But it was a substantial body and not likely\r\nto break or wear out, and when it was dressed the clothes covered much\r\nof its roughness. The head of Jack Pumpkinhead was, as you have\r\nguessed, a ripe pumpkin, with the eyes, nose and mouth carved upon one\r\nside. The pumpkin was stuck on Jack's wooden neck and was liable to\r\nget turned sidewise or backward and then he would have to straighten\r\nit with his wooden hands.\r\n\r\nThe worst thing about this sort of a head was that it did not keep\r\nwell and was sure to spoil sooner or later. So Jack's main business\r\nwas to grow a field of fine pumpkins each year, and always before his\r\nold head spoiled he would select a fresh pumpkin from the field and\r\ncarve the features on it very neatly, and have it ready to replace the\r\nold head whenever it became necessary. He didn't always carve it the\r\nsame way, so his friends never knew exactly what sort of an expression\r\nthey would find on his face. But there was no mistaking him, because\r\nhe was the only pumpkin-headed man alive in the Land of Oz.\r\n\r\nA one-legged sailor-man was a member of Ozma's council. His name was\r\nCap'n Bill and he had come to the Land of Oz with Trot, and had been\r\nmade welcome on account of his cleverness, honesty and good-nature. He\r\nwore a wooden leg to replace the one he had lost and was a great\r\nfriend of all the children in Oz because he could whittle all sorts of\r\ntoys out of wood with his big jack-knife.\r\n\r\nProfessor H. M. Wogglebug, T. E., was another member of the council.\r\nThe \"H. M.\" meant Highly Magnified, for the Professor was once a\r\nlittle bug, who became magnified to the size of a man and always\r\nremained so. The \"T. E.\" meant that he was Thoroughly Educated. He was\r\nat the head of Princess Ozma's Royal Athletic College, and so that the\r\nstudents would not have to study and so lose much time that could be\r\ndevoted to athletic sports, such as football, baseball and the like,\r\nProfessor Wogglebug had invented the famous Educational Pills. If one\r\nof the college students took a Geography Pill after breakfast, he knew\r\nhis geography lesson in an instant; if he took a Spelling Pill he at\r\nonce knew his spelling lesson, and an Arithmetic Pill enabled the\r\nstudent to do any kind of sum without having to think about it.\r\n\r\nThese useful pills made the college very popular and taught the boys\r\nand girls of Oz their lessons in the easiest possible way. In spite of\r\nthis, Professor Wogglebug was not a favorite outside his college, for\r\nhe was very conceited and admired himself so much and displayed his\r\ncleverness and learning so constantly, that no one cared to associate\r\nwith him. Ozma found him of value in her councils, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most splendidly dressed of all those present was a great\r\nfrog as large as a man, called the Frogman, who was noted for his wise\r\nsayings. He had come to the Emerald City from the Yip Country of Oz\r\nand was a guest of honor. His long-tailed coat was of velvet, his vest\r\nof satin and his trousers of finest silk. There were diamond buckles\r\non his shoes and he carried a gold-headed cane and a high silk hat.\r\nAll of the bright colors were represented in his rich attire, so it\r\ntired one's eyes to look at him for long, until one became used to his\r\nsplendor.\r\n\r\nThe best farmer in all Oz was Uncle Henry, who was Dorothy's own\r\nuncle, and who now lived near the Emerald City with his wife Aunt Em.\r\nUncle Henry taught the Oz people how to grow the finest vegetables and\r\nfruits and grains and was of much use to Ozma in keeping the Royal\r\nStorehouses well filled. He, too, was a counsellor.\r\n\r\nThe reason I mention the little Wizard of Oz last is because he was\r\nthe most important man in the Land of Oz. He wasn't a big man in size,\r\nbut he was a big man in power and intelligence and second only to\r\nGlinda the Good in all the mystic arts of magic. Glinda had taught\r\nhim, and the Wizard and the Sorceress were the only ones in Oz\r\npermitted by law to practice wizardry and sorcery, which they applied\r\nonly to good uses and for the benefit of the people.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard wasn't exactly handsome but he was pleasant to look at. His\r\nbald head was as shiny as if it had been varnished; there was always a\r\nmerry twinkle in his eyes and he was as spry as a schoolboy. Dorothy\r\nsays the reason the Wizard is not as powerful as Glinda is because\r\nGlinda didn't teach him all she knows, but what the Wizard knows he\r\nknows very well and so he performs some very remarkable magic.\r\n\r\nThe ten I have mentioned assembled, with the Scarecrow and Glinda, in\r\nOzma's throne room, right after dinner that evening, and the Sorceress\r\ntold them all she knew of the plight of Ozma and Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we must rescue them,\" she continued, \"and the sooner they\r\nare rescued the better pleased they will be; but what we must now\r\ndetermine is how they can be saved. That is why I have called you\r\ntogether in council.\"\r\n\r\n\"The easiest way,\" remarked the Shaggy Man, \"is to raise the sunken\r\nisland of the Skeezers to the top of the water again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me how?\" said Glinda.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how, your Highness, for I have never raised a sunken\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might all get under it and lift,\" suggested Professor Wogglebug.\r\n\r\n\"How can we get under it when it rests on the bottom of the lake?\"\r\nasked the Sorceress.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we throw a rope around it and pull it ashore?\" inquired Jack\r\nPumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n\"Why not pump the water out of the lake?\" suggested the Patchwork Girl\r\nwith a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Do be sensible!\" pleaded Glinda. \"This is a serious matter, and we\r\nmust give it serious thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"How big is the lake and how big is the island?\" was the Frogman's\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"None of us can tell, for we have not been there.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said the Scarecrow, \"it appears to me we ought to go\r\nto the Skeezer country and examine it carefully.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right,\" agreed the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\"We-will-have-to-go-there-any-how,\" remarked Tik-Tok in his jerky\r\nmachine voice.\r\n\r\n\"The question is which of us shall go, and how many of us?\" said the\r\nWizard.\r\n\r\n\"I shall go of course,\" declared the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Scraps.\r\n\r\n\"It is my duty to Ozma to go,\" asserted the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\"I could not stay away, knowing our loved Princess is in danger,\" said\r\nthe Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"We all feel like that,\" Uncle Henry said.\r\n\r\nFinally one and all present decided to go to the Skeezer country, with\r\nGlinda and the little Wizard to lead them. Magic must meet magic in\r\norder to conquer it, so these two skillful magic-workers were\r\nnecessary to insure the success of the expedition.\r\n\r\nThey were all ready to start at a moment's notice, for none had any\r\naffairs of importance to attend to. Jack was wearing a newly made\r\nPumpkin-head and the Scarecrow had recently been stuffed with fresh\r\nstraw. Tik-Tok's machinery was in good running order and the Tin\r\nWoodman always was well oiled. \"It is quite a long journey,\" said\r\nGlinda, \"and while I might travel quickly to the Skeezer country by\r\nmeans of my stork chariot the rest of you will be obliged to walk. So,\r\nas we must keep together, I will send my chariot back to my castle and\r\nwe will plan to leave the Emerald City at sunrise to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15\r\n\r\nThe Great Sorceress\r\n\r\n\r\nBetsy and Trot, when they heard of the rescue expedition, begged the\r\nWizard to permit them to join it and he consented. The Glass Cat,\r\noverhearing the conversation, wanted to go also and to this the\r\nWizard made no objection.\r\n\r\nThis Glass Cat was one of the real curiosities of Oz. It had been made\r\nand brought to life by a clever magician named Dr. Pipt, who was not\r\nnow permitted to work magic and was an ordinary citizen of the Emerald\r\nCity. The cat was of transparent glass, through which one could\r\nplainly see its ruby heart beating and its pink brains whirling around\r\nin the top of the head.\r\n\r\nThe Glass Cat's eyes were emeralds; its fluffy tail was of spun glass\r\nand very beautiful. The ruby heart, while pretty to look at, was hard\r\nand cold and the Glass Cat's disposition was not pleasant at all\r\ntimes. It scorned to catch mice, did not eat, and was extremely lazy.\r\nIf you complimented the remarkable cat on her beauty, she would be\r\nvery friendly, for she loved admiration above everything. The pink\r\nbrains were always working and their owner was indeed more intelligent\r\nthan most common cats.\r\n\r\nThree other additions to the rescue party were made the next morning,\r\njust as they were setting out upon their journey. The first was a\r\nlittle boy called Button Bright, because he had no other name that\r\nanyone could remember. He was a fine, manly little fellow, well\r\nmannered and good humored, who had only one bad fault. He was\r\ncontinually getting lost. To be sure, Button Bright got found as often\r\nas he got lost, but when he was missing his friends could not help\r\nbeing anxious about him.\r\n\r\n\"Some day,\" predicted the Patchwork Girl, \"he won't be found, and that\r\nwill be the last of him.\" But that didn't worry Button Bright, who was\r\nso careless that he did not seem to be able to break the habit of\r\ngetting lost.\r\n\r\nThe second addition to the party was a Munchkin boy of about Button\r\nBright's age, named Ojo. He was often called \"Ojo the Lucky,\" because\r\ngood fortune followed him wherever he went. He and Button Bright were\r\nclose friends, although of such different natures, and Trot and Betsy\r\nwere fond of both.\r\n\r\nThe third and last to join the expedition was an enormous lion, one of\r\nOzma's regular guardians and the most important and intelligent beast\r\nin all Oz. He called himself the Cowardly Lion, saying that every\r\nlittle danger scared him so badly that his heart thumped against his\r\nribs, but all who knew him knew that the Cowardly Lion's fears were\r\ncoupled with bravery and that however much he might be frightened he\r\nsummoned courage to meet every danger he encountered. Often he had\r\nsaved Dorothy and Ozma in times of peril, but afterward he moaned and\r\ntrembled and wept because he had been so scared.\r\n\r\n\"If Ozma needs help, I'm going to help her,\" said the great beast.\r\n\"Also, I suspect the rest of you may need me on the journey--especially\r\nTrot and Betsy--for you may pass through a dangerous part of the\r\ncountry. I know that wild Gillikin country pretty well. Its forests\r\nharbor many ferocious beasts.\"\r\n\r\nThey were glad the Cowardly Lion was to join them, and in good spirits\r\nthe entire party formed a procession and marched out of the Emerald\r\nCity amid the shouts of the people, who wished them success and a safe\r\nreturn with their beloved Ruler.\r\n\r\nThey followed a different route from that taken by Ozma and Dorothy,\r\nfor they went through the Winkie Country and up north toward Oogaboo.\r\nBut before they got there they swerved to the left and entered the\r\nGreat Gillikin Forest, the nearest thing to a wilderness in all Oz.\r\nEven the Cowardly Lion had to admit that certain parts of this forest\r\nwere unknown to him, although he had often wandered among the trees,\r\nand the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman, who were great travelers, never had\r\nbeen there at all.\r\n\r\nThe forest was only reached after a tedious tramp, for some of the\r\nRescue Expedition were quite awkward on their feet. The Patchwork Girl\r\nwas as light as a feather and very spry; the Tin Woodman covered the\r\nground as easily as Uncle Henry and the Wizard; but Tik-Tok moved\r\nslowly and the slightest obstruction in the road would halt him until\r\nthe others cleared it away. Then, too, Tik-Tok's machinery kept\r\nrunning down, so Betsy and Trot took turns in winding it up.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow was more clumsy but less bother, for although he often\r\nstumbled and fell he could scramble up again and a little patting of\r\nhis straw-stuffed body would put him in good shape again.\r\n\r\nAnother awkward one was Jack Pumpkinhead, for walking would jar his\r\nhead around on his neck and then he would be likely to go in the wrong\r\ndirection. But the Frogman took Jack's arm and then he followed the\r\npath more easily.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill's wooden leg didn't prevent him from keeping up with the\r\nothers and the old sailor could walk as far as any of them.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the forest the Cowardly lion took the lead. There\r\nwas no path here for men, but many beasts had made paths of their own\r\nwhich only the eyes of the lion, practiced in woodcraft, could\r\ndiscern. So he stalked ahead and wound his way in and out, the others\r\nfollowing in single file, Glinda being next to the Lion.\r\n\r\nThere are dangers in the forest, of course, but as the huge Lion\r\nheaded the party he kept the wild denizens of the wilderness from\r\nbothering the travelers. Once, to be sure, an enormous leopard sprang\r\nupon the Glass Cat and caught her in his powerful jaws, but he broke\r\nseveral of his teeth and with howls of pain and dismay dropped his\r\nprey and vanished among the trees.\r\n\r\n\"Are you hurt?\" Trot anxiously inquired of the Glass Cat.\r\n\r\n\"How silly!\" exclaimed the creature in an irritated tone of voice;\r\n\"nothing can hurt glass, and I'm too solid to break easily. But I'm\r\nannoyed at that leopard's impudence. He has no respect for beauty or\r\nintelligence. If he had noticed my pink brains work, I'm sure he would\r\nhave realized I'm too important to be grabbed in a wild beast's jaws.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said Trot consolingly; \"I'm sure he won't do it again.\"\r\n\r\nThey were almost in the center of the forest when Ojo, the Munchkin\r\nboy, suddenly said: \"Why, where's Button Bright?\"\r\n\r\nThey halted and looked around them. Button Bright was not with the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me,\" remarked Betsy, \"I expect he's lost again!\"\r\n\r\n\"When did you see him last, Ojo?\" inquired Glinda.\r\n\r\n\"It was some time ago,\" replied Ojo. \"He was trailing along at the end\r\nand throwing twigs at the squirrels in the trees. Then I went to talk\r\nto Betsy and Trot, and just now I noticed he was gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is too bad,\" declared the Wizard, \"for it is sure to delay our\r\njourney. We must find Button Bright before we go any farther, for\r\nthis forest is full of ferocious beasts that would not hesitate to\r\ntear the boy to pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what shall we do?\" asked the Scarecrow. \"If any of us leaves the\r\nparty to search for Button Bright he or she might fall a victim to the\r\nbeasts, and if the Lion leaves us we will have no protector.\r\n\r\n\"The Glass Cat could go,\" suggested the Frogman. \"The beasts can do\r\nher no harm, as we have discovered.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wizard turned to Glinda.\r\n\r\n\"Cannot your sorcery discover where Button Bright is?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" replied the Sorceress.\r\n\r\nShe called to Uncle Henry, who had been carrying her wicker box, to\r\nbring it to her, and when he obeyed she opened it and drew out a small\r\nround mirror. On the surface of the glass she dusted a white powder\r\nand then wiped it away with her handkerchief and looked in the mirror.\r\nIt reflected a part of the forest, and there, beneath a wide-spreading\r\ntree, Button Bright was lying asleep. On one side of him crouched a\r\ntiger, ready to spring; on the other side was a big gray wolf, its\r\nbared fangs glistening in a wicked way.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness me!\" cried Trot, looking over Glinda's shoulder. \"They'll\r\ncatch and kill him sure.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone crowded around for a glimpse at the magic mirror.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty bad--pretty bad!\" said the Scarecrow sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\"Comes of getting lost!\" said Cap'n Bill, sighing.\r\n\r\n\"Guess he's a goner!\" said the Frogman, wiping his eyes on his purple\r\nsilk handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"But where is he? Can't we save him?\" asked Ojo the Lucky.\r\n\r\n\"If we knew where he is we could probably save him,\" replied the\r\nlittle Wizard, \"but that tree looks so much like all the other trees,\r\nthat we can't tell whether it's far away or near by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at Glinda!\" exclaimed Betsy.\r\n\r\nGlinda, having handed the mirror to the Wizard, had stepped aside and\r\nwas making strange passes with her outstretched arms and reciting in\r\nlow, sweet tones a mystical incantation. Most of them watched the\r\nSorceress with anxious eyes, despair giving way to the hope that she\r\nmight be able to save their friend. The Wizard, however, watched the\r\nscene in the mirror, while over his shoulders peered Trot, the\r\nScarecrow and the Shaggy Man.\r\n\r\nWhat they saw was more strange than Glinda's actions. The tiger\r\nstarted to spring on the sleeping boy, but suddenly lost its power to\r\nmove and lay flat upon the ground. The gray wolf seemed unable to lift\r\nits feet from the ground. It pulled first at one leg and then at\r\nanother, and finding itself strangely confined to the spot began to\r\nbark and snarl angrily. They couldn't hear the barkings and snarls,\r\nbut they could see the creature's mouth open and its thick lips move.\r\nButton Bright, however, being but a few feet away from the wolf, heard\r\nits cries of rage, which wakened him from his untroubled sleep.\r\n\r\nThe boy sat up and looked first at the tiger and then at the wolf. His\r\nface showed that for a moment he was quite frightened, but he soon saw\r\nthat the beasts were unable to approach him and so he got upon his\r\nfeet and examined them curiously, with a mischievous smile upon his\r\nface. Then he deliberately kicked the tiger's head with his foot and\r\ncatching up a fallen branch of a tree he went to the wolf and gave it\r\na good whacking. Both the beasts were furious at such treatment but\r\ncould not resent it.\r\n\r\nButton Bright now threw down the stick and with his hands in his\r\npockets wandered carelessly away.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Glinda, \"let the Glass Cat run and find him. He is in that\r\ndirection,\" pointing the way, \"but how far off I do not know. Make\r\nhaste and lead him back to us as quickly as you can.\"\r\n\r\nThe Glass Cat did not obey everyone's orders, but she really feared\r\nthe great Sorceress, so as soon as the words were spoken the crystal\r\nanimal darted away and was quickly lost to sight.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard handed the mirror back to Glinda, for the woodland scene\r\nhad now faded from the glass. Then those who cared to rest sat down to\r\nawait Button Bright's coming. It was not long before he appeared\r\nthrough the trees and as he rejoined his friends he said in a peevish\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n\"Don't ever send that Glass Cat to find me again. She was very\r\nimpolite and, if we didn't all know that she had no manners, I'd say\r\nshe insulted me.\"\r\n\r\nGlinda turned upon the boy sternly.\r\n\r\n\"You have caused all of us much anxiety and annoyance,\" said she.\r\n\"Only my magic saved you from destruction. I forbid you to get lost\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he answered. \"It won't be _my_ fault if I get lost again;\r\nbut it wasn't my fault _this_ time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16\r\n\r\nThe Enchanted Fishes\r\n\r\n\r\nI must now tell you what happened to Ervic and the three other\r\nSkeezers who were left floating in the iron boat after Queen Coo-ee-oh\r\nhad been transformed into a Diamond Swan by the magic of the Flathead\r\nSu-dic.\r\n\r\nThe four Skeezers were all young men and their leader was Ervic.\r\nCoo-ee-oh had taken them with her in the boat to assist her if she\r\ncaptured the Flathead chief, as she hoped to do by means of her silver\r\nrope. They knew nothing about the witchcraft that moved the submarine\r\nand so, when left floating upon the lake, were at a loss what to do.\r\nThe submarine could not be submerged by them or made to return to the\r\nsunken island. There were neither oars nor sails in the boat, which\r\nwas not anchored but drifted quietly upon the surface of the lake.\r\n\r\nThe Diamond Swan had no further thought or care for her people. She\r\nhad sailed over to the other side of the lake and all the calls and\r\npleadings of Ervic and his companions were unheeded by the vain bird.\r\nAs there was nothing else for them to do, they sat quietly in their\r\nboat and waited as patiently as they could for someone to come to\r\ntheir aid.\r\n\r\nThe Flatheads had refused to help them and had gone back to their\r\nmountain. All the Skeezers were imprisoned in the Great Dome and could\r\nnot help even themselves. When evening came, they saw the Diamond\r\nSwan, still keeping to the opposite shore of the lake, walk out of the\r\nwater to the sands, shake her diamond-sprinkled feathers, and then\r\ndisappear among the bushes to seek a resting place for the night.\r\n\r\n\"I'm hungry,\" said Ervic.\r\n\r\n\"I'm cold,\" said another Skeezer.\r\n\r\n\"I'm tired,\" said a third.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid,\" said the last one of them.\r\n\r\nBut it did them no good to complain. Night fell and the moon rose and\r\ncast a silvery sheen over the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n\"Go to sleep,\" said Ervic to his companions. \"I'll stay awake and\r\nwatch, for we may be rescued in some unexpected way.\"\r\n\r\nSo the other three laid themselves down in the bottom of the boat and\r\nwere soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\nErvic watched. He rested himself by leaning over the bow of the boat,\r\nhis face near to the moonlit water, and thought dreamily of the day's\r\nsurprising events and wondered what would happen to the prisoners in\r\nthe Great Dome.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a tiny goldfish popped its head above the surface of the\r\nlake, not more than a foot from his eyes. A silverfish then raised its\r\nhead beside that of the goldfish, and a moment later a bronzefish\r\nlifted its head beside the others. The three fish, all in a row,\r\nlooked earnestly with their round, bright eyes into the astonished\r\neyes of Ervic the Skeezer.\r\n\r\n\"We are the three Adepts whom Queen Coo-ee-oh betrayed and wickedly\r\ntransformed,\" said the goldfish, its voice low and soft but distinctly\r\nheard in the stillness of the night.\r\n\r\n\"I know of our Queen's treacherous deed,\" replied Ervic, \"and I am\r\nsorry for your misfortune. Have you been in the lake ever since?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"I--I hope you are well--and comfortable,\" stammered Ervic, not\r\nknowing what else to say.\r\n\r\n\"We knew that some day Coo-ee-oh would meet with the fate she so\r\nrichly deserves,\" declared the bronzefish. \"We have waited and watched\r\nfor this time. Now if you will promise to help us and will be faithful\r\nand true, you can aid us in regaining our natural forms, and save\r\nyourself and all your people from the dangers that now threaten you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Ervic, \"you can depend on my doing the best I can. But\r\nI'm no witch, nor magician, you must know.\"\r\n\r\n\"All we ask is that you obey our instructions,\" returned the\r\nsilverfish. \"We know that you are honest and that you served Coo-ee-oh\r\nonly because you were obliged to in order to escape her anger. Do as\r\nwe command and all will be well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promise!\" exclaimed the young man. \"Tell me what I am to do first.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find in the bottom of your boat the silver cord which\r\ndropped from Coo-ee-oh's hand when she was transformed,\" said the\r\ngoldfish. \"Tie one end of that cord to the bow of your boat and drop\r\nthe other end to us in the water. Together we will pull your boat to\r\nthe shore.\"\r\n\r\nErvic much doubted that the three small fishes could move so heavy a\r\nboat, but he did as he was told and the fishes all seized their end of\r\nthe silver cord in their mouths and headed toward the nearest shore,\r\nwhich was the very place where the Flatheads had stood when they\r\nconquered Queen Coo-ee-oh.\r\n\r\nAt first the boat did not move at all, although the fishes pulled with\r\nall their strength. But presently the strain began to tell. Very\r\nslowly the boat crept toward the shore, gaining more speed at every\r\nmoment. A couple of yards away from the sandy beach the fishes dropped\r\nthe cord from their mouths and swam to one side, while the iron boat,\r\nbeing now under way, continued to move until its prow grated upon the\r\nsands.\r\n\r\nErvic leaned over the side and said to the fishes: \"What next?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find upon the sand,\" said the silverfish, \"a copper kettle,\r\nwhich the Su-dic forgot when he went away. Cleanse it thoroughly in\r\nthe water of the lake, for it has had poison in it. When it is\r\ncleaned, fill it with fresh water and hold it over the side of the\r\nboat, so that we three may swim into the kettle. We will then instruct\r\nyou further.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish me to catch you, then?\" asked Ervic in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nSo Ervic jumped out of the boat and found the copper kettle. Carrying\r\nit a little way down the beach, he washed it well, scrubbing away\r\nevery drop of the poison it had contained with sand from the shore.\r\n\r\nThen he went back to the boat.\r\n\r\nErvic's comrades were still sound asleep and knew nothing of the three\r\nfishes or what strange happenings were taking place about them. Ervic\r\ndipped the kettle in the lake, holding fast to the handle until it\r\nwas under water. The gold and silver and bronze fishes promptly swam\r\ninto the kettle. The young Skeezer then lifted it, poured out a little\r\nof the water so it would not spill over the edge, and said to the\r\nfishes: \"What next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Carry the kettle to the shore. Take one hundred steps to the east,\r\nalong the edge of the lake, and then you will see a path leading\r\nthrough the meadows, up hill and down dale. Follow the path until you\r\ncome to a cottage which is painted a purple color with white\r\ntrimmings. When you stop at the gate of this cottage we will tell you\r\nwhat to do next. Be careful, above all, not to stumble and spill the\r\nwater from the kettle, or you would destroy us and all you have done\r\nwould be in vain.\"\r\n\r\nThe goldfish issued these commands and Ervic promised to be careful\r\nand started to obey. He left his sleeping comrades in the boat,\r\nstepping cautiously over their bodies, and on reaching the shore took\r\nexactly one hundred steps to the east. Then he looked for the path and\r\nthe moonlight was so bright that he easily discovered it, although it\r\nwas hidden from view by tall weeds until one came full upon it. This\r\npath was very narrow and did not seem to be much used, but it was\r\nquite distinct and Ervic had no difficulty in following it. He walked\r\nthrough a broad meadow, covered with tall grass and weeds, up a hill\r\nand down into a valley and then up another hill and down again.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Ervic that he had walked miles and miles. Indeed the moon\r\nsank low and day was beginning to dawn when finally he discovered by\r\nthe roadside a pretty little cottage, painted purple with white\r\ntrimmings. It was a lonely place--no other buildings were anywhere\r\nabout and the ground was not tilled at all. No farmer lived here, that\r\nwas certain. Who would care to dwell in such an isolated place?\r\n\r\nBut Ervic did not bother his head long with such questions. He went up\r\nto the gate that led to the cottage, set the copper kettle carefully\r\ndown and bending over it asked:\r\n\r\n\"What next?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17\r\n\r\nUnder the Great Dome\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Glinda the Good and her followers of the Rescue Expedition came\r\nin sight of the Enchanted Mountain of the Flatheads, it was away to\r\nthe left of them, for the route they had taken through the Great\r\nForest was some distance from that followed by Ozma and Dorothy.\r\n\r\nThey halted awhile to decide whether they should call upon the Supreme\r\nDictator first, or go on to the Lake of the Skeezers.\r\n\r\n\"If we go to the mountain,\" said the Wizard, \"we may get into trouble\r\nwith that wicked Su-dic, and then we would be delayed in rescuing Ozma\r\nand Dorothy. So I think our best plan will be to go to the Skeezer\r\nCountry, raise the sunken island and save our friends and the\r\nimprisoned Skeezers. Afterward we can visit the mountain and punish\r\nthe cruel magician of the Flatheads.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is sensible,\" approved the Shaggy Man. \"I quite agree with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe others, too, seemed to think the Wizard's plan the best, and\r\nGlinda herself commended it, so on they marched toward the line of\r\npalm trees that hid the Skeezers' lake from view.\r\n\r\nPretty soon they came to the palms. These were set closely together,\r\nthe branches, which came quite to the ground, being so tightly\r\ninterlaced that even the Glass Cat could scarcely find a place to\r\nsqueeze through. The path which the Flatheads used was some distance\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a job for the Tin Woodman,\" said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\nSo the Tin Woodman, who was always glad to be of use, set to work with\r\nhis sharp, gleaming axe, which he always carried, and in a\r\nsurprisingly short time had chopped away enough branches to permit\r\nthem all to pass easily through the trees.\r\n\r\nNow the clear waters of the beautiful lake were before them and by\r\nlooking closely they could see the outlines of the Great Dome of the\r\nsunken island, far from shore and directly in the center of the lake.\r\n\r\nOf course every eye was at first fixed upon this dome, where Ozma and\r\nDorothy and the Skeezers were still fast prisoners. But soon their\r\nattention was caught by a more brilliant sight, for here was the\r\nDiamond Swan swimming just before them, its long neck arched proudly,\r\nthe amethyst eyes gleaming and all the diamond-sprinkled feathers\r\nglistening splendidly under the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Glinda, \"is the transformation of Queen Coo-ee-oh, the\r\nhaughty and wicked witch who betrayed the three Adepts at Magic and\r\ntreated her people like slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's wonderfully beautiful now,\" remarked the Frogman.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't seem like much of a punishment,\" said Trot. \"The Flathead\r\nSu-dic ought to have made her a toad.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure Coo-ee-oh is punished,\" said Glinda, \"for she has lost all\r\nher magic power and her grand palace and can no longer misrule the\r\npoor Skeezers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us call to her, and hear what she has to say,\" proposed the\r\nWizard.\r\n\r\nSo Glinda beckoned the Diamond Swan, which swam gracefully to a\r\nposition near them. Before anyone could speak Coo-ee-oh called to\r\nthem in a rasping voice--for the voice of a swan is always harsh and\r\nunpleasant--and said with much pride:\r\n\r\n\"Admire me, Strangers! Admire the lovely Coo-ee-oh, the handsomest\r\ncreature in all Oz. Admire me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Handsome is as handsome does,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"Are your deeds\r\nlovely, Coo-ee-oh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Deeds? What deeds can a swan do but swim around and give pleasure to\r\nall beholders?\" said the sparkling bird.\r\n\r\n\"Have you forgotten your former life? Have you forgotten your magic\r\nand witchcraft?\" inquired the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"Magic--witchcraft? Pshaw, who cares for such silly things?\" retorted\r\nCoo-ee-oh. \"As for my past life, it seems like an unpleasant dream. I\r\nwouldn't go back to it if I could. Don't you admire my beauty,\r\nStrangers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us, Coo-ee-oh,\" said Glinda earnestly, \"if you can recall enough\r\nof your witchcraft to enable us to raise the sunken island to the\r\nsurface of the lake. Tell us that and I'll give you a string of pearls\r\nto wear around your neck and add to your beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing can add to my beauty, for I'm the most beautiful creature\r\nanywhere in the whole world.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can we raise the island?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know and I don't care. If ever I knew I've forgotten, and I'm\r\nglad of it,\" was the response. \"Just watch me circle around and see me\r\nglitter!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's no use,\" said Button Bright; \"the old Swan is too much in love\r\nwith herself to think of anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a fact,\" agreed Betsy with a sigh; \"but we've got to get Ozma\r\nand Dorothy out of that lake, somehow or other.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we must do it in our own way,\" added the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"But how?\" asked Uncle Henry in a grave voice, for he could not bear\r\nto think of his dear niece Dorothy being out there under water; \"how\r\nshall we do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave that to Glinda,\" advised the Wizard, realizing he was helpless\r\nto do it himself.\r\n\r\n\"If it were just an ordinary sunken island,\" said the powerful\r\nSorceress, \"there would be several ways by which I might bring it to\r\nthe surface again. But this is a Magic Isle, and by some curious art\r\nof witchcraft, unknown to any but Queen Coo-ee-oh, it obeys certain\r\ncommands of magic and will not respond to any other. I do not despair\r\nin the least, but it will require some deep study to solve this\r\ndifficult problem. If the Swan could only remember the witchcraft that\r\nshe invented and knew as a woman, I could force her to tell me the\r\nsecret, but all her former knowledge is now forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said the Wizard after a brief silence had followed\r\nGlinda's speech, \"that there are three fishes in this lake that used\r\nto be Adepts at Magic and from whom Coo-ee-oh stole much of her\r\nknowledge. If we could find those fishes and return them to their\r\nformer shapes, they could doubtless tell us what to do to bring the\r\nsunken island to the surface.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have thought of those fishes,\" replied Glinda, \"but among so many\r\nfishes as this lake contains how are we to single them out?\"\r\n\r\nYou will understand, of course, that had Glinda been at home in her\r\ncastle, where the Great Book of Records was, she would have known that\r\nErvic the Skeezer already had taken the gold and silver and bronze\r\nfishes from the lake. But that act had been recorded in the Book after\r\nGlinda had set out on this journey, so it was all unknown to her.\r\n\r\n\"I think I see a boat yonder on the shore,\" said Ojo the Munchkin boy,\r\npointing to a place around the edge of the lake. \"If we could get\r\nthat boat and row all over the lake, calling to the magic fishes, we\r\nmight be able to find them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go to the boat,\" said the Wizard.\r\n\r\nThey walked around the lake to where the boat was stranded upon the\r\nbeach, but found it empty. It was a mere shell of blackened steel,\r\nwith a collapsible roof that, when in position, made the submarine\r\nwater-tight, but at present the roof rested in slots on either side of\r\nthe magic craft. There were no oars or sails, no machinery to make the\r\nboat go, and although Glinda promptly realized it was meant to be\r\noperated by witchcraft, she was not acquainted with that sort of\r\nmagic.\r\n\r\n\"However,\" said she, \"the boat is merely a boat, and I believe I can\r\nmake it obey a command of sorcery, as well as it did the command of\r\nwitchcraft. After I have given a little thought to the matter, the\r\nboat will take us wherever we desire to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not all of us,\" returned the Wizard, \"for it won't hold so many. But,\r\nmost noble Sorceress, provided you can make the boat go, of what use\r\nwill it be to us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't we use it to catch the three fishes?\" asked Button Bright.\r\n\r\n\"It will not be necessary to use the boat for that purpose,\" replied\r\nGlinda. \"Wherever in the lake the enchanted fishes may be, they will\r\nanswer to my call. What I am trying to discover is how the boat came\r\nto be on this shore, while the island on which it belongs is under\r\nwater yonder. Did Coo-ee-oh come here in the boat to meet the\r\nFlatheads before the island was sunk, or afterward?\"\r\n\r\nNo one could answer that question, of course; but while they pondered\r\nthe matter three young men advanced from the line of trees, and\r\nrather timidly bowed to the strangers.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, and where did you come from!\" inquired the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"We are Skeezers,\" answered one of them, \"and our home is on the Magic\r\nIsle of the Lake. We ran away when we saw you coming, and hid behind\r\nthe trees, but as you are Strangers and seem to be friendly we decided\r\nto meet you, for we are in great trouble and need assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you belong on the island, why are you here?\" demanded Glinda.\r\n\r\nSo they told her all the story: How the Queen had defied the Flatheads\r\nand submerged the whole island so that her enemies could not get to it\r\nor destroy it; how, when the Flatheads came to the shore, Coo-ee-oh\r\nhad commanded them, together with their friend Ervic, to go with her\r\nin the submarine to conquer the Su-dic, and how the boat had shot out\r\nfrom the basement of the sunken isle, obeying a magic word, and risen\r\nto the surface, where it opened and floated upon the water.\r\n\r\nThen followed the account of how the Su-dic had transformed Coo-ee-oh\r\ninto a swan, after which she had forgotten all the witchcraft she ever\r\nknew. The young men told how in the night when they were asleep,\r\ntheir comrade Ervic had mysteriously disappeared, while the boat in\r\nsome strange manner had floated to the shore and stranded upon the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nThat was all they knew. They had searched in vain for three days for\r\nErvic. As their island was under water and they could not get back to\r\nit, the three Skeezers had no place to go, and so had waited patiently\r\nbeside their boat for something to happen.\r\n\r\nBeing questioned by Glinda and the Wizard, they told all they knew\r\nabout Ozma and Dorothy and declared the two girls were still in the\r\nvillage under the Great Dome. They were quite safe and would be well\r\ncared for by Lady Aurex, now that the Queen who opposed them was out\r\nof the way.\r\n\r\nWhen they had gleaned all the information they could from these\r\nSkeezers, the Wizard said to Glinda:\r\n\r\n\"If you find you can make this boat obey your sorcery, you could have\r\nit return to the island, submerge itself, and enter the door in the\r\nbasement from which it came. But I cannot see that our going to the\r\nsunken island would enable our friends to escape. We would only join\r\nthem as prisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, friend Wizard,\" replied Glinda. \"If the boat would obey my\r\ncommands to enter the basement door, it would also obey my commands to\r\ncome out again, and I could bring Ozma and Dorothy back with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And leave all of our people still imprisoned?\" asked one of the\r\nSkeezers reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"By making several trips in the boat, Glinda could fetch all your\r\npeople to the shore,\" replied the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"But what could they do then?\" inquired another Skeezer. \"They would\r\nhave no homes and no place to go, and would be at the mercy of their\r\nenemies, the Flatheads.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" said Glinda the Good. \"And as these people are Ozma's\r\nsubjects, I think she would refuse to escape with Dorothy and leave\r\nthe others behind, or to abandon the island which is the lawful home\r\nof the Skeezers. I believe the best plan will be to summon the three\r\nfishes and learn from them how to raise the island.\"\r\n\r\nThe little Wizard seemed to think that this was rather a forlorn hope.\r\n\r\n\"How will you summon them,\" he asked the lovely Sorceress, \"and how\r\ncan they hear you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is something we must consider carefully,\" responded stately\r\nGlinda, with a serene smile. \"I think I can find a way.\"\r\n\r\nAll of Ozma's counsellors applauded this sentiment, for they knew\r\nwell the powers of the Sorceress.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" agreed the Wizard. \"Summon them, most noble Glinda.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18\r\n\r\nThe Cleverness of Ervic\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now return to Ervic the Skeezer, who, when he had set down the\r\ncopper kettle containing the three fishes at the gate of the lonely\r\ncottage, had asked, \"What next?\"\r\n\r\nThe goldfish stuck its head above the water in the kettle and said in\r\nits small but distinct voice:\r\n\r\n\"You are to lift the latch, open the door, and walk boldly into the\r\ncottage. Do not be afraid of anything you see, for however you seem to\r\nbe threatened with dangers, nothing can harm you. The cottage is the\r\nhome of a powerful Yookoohoo, named Reera the Red, who assumes all\r\nsorts of forms, sometimes changing her form several times in a day,\r\naccording to her fancy. What her real form may be we do not know. This\r\nstrange creature cannot be bribed with treasure, or coaxed through\r\nfriendship, or won by pity. She has never assisted anyone, or done\r\nwrong to anyone, that we know of. All her wonderful powers are used\r\nfor her own selfish amusement. She will order you out of the house but\r\nyou must refuse to go. Remain and watch Reera closely and try to see\r\nwhat she uses to accomplish her transformations. If you can discover\r\nthe secret whisper it to us and we will then tell you what to do\r\nnext.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds easy,\" returned Ervic, who had listened carefully. \"But\r\nare you sure she will not hurt me, or try to transform me?\"\r\n\r\n\"She may change your form,\" replied the goldfish, \"but do not worry if\r\nthat happens, for we can break that enchantment easily. You may be\r\nsure that nothing will harm you, so you must not be frightened at\r\nanything you see or hear.\"\r\n\r\nNow Ervic was as brave as any ordinary young man, and he knew the\r\nfishes who spoke to him were truthful and to be relied upon,\r\nnevertheless he experienced a strange sinking of the heart as he\r\npicked up the kettle and approached the door of the cottage. His hand\r\ntrembled as he raised the latch, but he was resolved to obey his\r\ninstructions. He pushed the door open, took three strides into the\r\nmiddle of the one room the cottage contained, and then stood still and\r\nlooked around him.\r\n\r\nThe sights that met his gaze were enough to frighten anyone who had\r\nnot been properly warned. On the floor just before Ervic lay a great\r\ncrocodile, its red eyes gleaming wickedly and its wide open mouth\r\ndisplaying rows of sharp teeth. Horned toads hopped about; each of the\r\nfour upper corners of the room was festooned with a thick cobweb, in\r\nthe center of which sat a spider as big around as a washbasin, and\r\narmed with pincher-like claws; a red-and-green lizard was stretched at\r\nfull length on the window-sill and black rats darted in and out of the\r\nholes they had gnawed in the floor of the cottage.\r\n\r\nBut the most startling thing was a huge gray ape which sat upon a\r\nbench and knitted. It wore a lace cap, such as old ladies wear, and a\r\nlittle apron of lace, but no other clothing. Its eyes were bright and\r\nlooked as if coals were burning in them. The ape moved as naturally as\r\nan ordinary person might, and on Ervic's entrance stopped knitting and\r\nraised its head to look at him.\r\n\r\n\"Get out!\" cried a sharp voice, seeming to come from the ape's mouth.\r\n\r\nErvic saw another bench, empty, just beyond him, so he stepped over\r\nthe crocodile, sat down upon the bench and carefully placed the kettle\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\n\"Get out!\" again cried the voice.\r\n\r\nErvic shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said he, \"I'm going to stay.\"\r\n\r\nThe spiders left their four corners, dropped to the floor and made a\r\nrush toward the young Skeezer, circling around his legs with their\r\npinchers extended. Ervic paid no attention to them. An enormous black\r\nrat ran up Ervic's body, passed around his shoulders and uttered\r\npiercing squeals in his ears, but he did not wince. The green-and-red\r\nlizard, coming from the window-sill, approached Ervic and began\r\nspitting a flaming fluid at him, but Ervic merely stared at the\r\ncreature and its flame did not touch him.\r\n\r\nThe crocodile raised its tail and, swinging around, swept Ervic off\r\nthe bench with a powerful blow. But the Skeezer managed to save the\r\nkettle from upsetting and he got up, shook off the horned toads that\r\nwere crawling over him and resumed his seat on the bench.\r\n\r\nAll the creatures, after this first attack, remained motionless, as if\r\nawaiting orders. The old gray ape knitted on, not looking toward Ervic\r\nnow, and the young Skeezer stolidly kept his seat. He expected\r\nsomething else to happen, but nothing did. A full hour passed and\r\nErvic was growing nervous.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" the ape asked at last.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Ervic.\r\n\r\n\"You may have that!\" retorted the ape, and at this all the strange\r\ncreatures in the room broke into a chorus of cackling laughter.\r\n\r\nAnother long wait.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know who I am?\" questioned the ape.\r\n\r\n\"You must be Reera the Red--the Yookoohoo,\" Ervic answered.\r\n\r\n\"Knowing so much, you must also know that I do not like strangers.\r\nYour presence here in my home annoys me. Do you not fear my anger?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the young man.\r\n\r\n\"Do you intend to obey me, and leave this house?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Ervic, just as quietly as the Yookoohoo had spoken.\r\n\r\nThe ape knitted for a long time before resuming the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Curiosity,\" it said, \"has led to many a man's undoing. I suppose in\r\nsome way you have learned that I do tricks of magic, and so through\r\ncuriosity you have come here. You may have been told that I do not\r\ninjure anyone, so you are bold enough to disobey my commands to go\r\naway. You imagine that you may witness some of the rites of\r\nwitchcraft, and that they may amuse you. Have I spoken truly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" remarked Ervic, who had been pondering on the strange\r\ncircumstances of his coming here, \"you are right in some ways, but not\r\nin others. I am told that you work magic only for your own amusement.\r\nThat seems to me very selfish. Few people understand magic. I'm told\r\nthat you are the only real Yookoohoo in all Oz. Why don't you amuse\r\nothers as well as yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"What right have you to question my actions?\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you say you are not here to demand any favors of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"For myself I want nothing from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are wise in that. I never grant favors.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't worry me,\" declared Ervic.\r\n\r\n\"But you are curious? You hope to witness some of my magic\r\ntransformations?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you wish to perform any magic, go ahead,\" said Ervic. \"It may\r\ninterest me and it may not. If you'd rather go on with your knitting,\r\nit's all the same to me. I am in no hurry at all.\"\r\n\r\nThis may have puzzled Red Reera, but the face beneath the lace cap\r\ncould show no expression, being covered with hair. Perhaps in all her\r\ncareer the Yookoohoo had never been visited by anyone who, like this\r\nyoung man, asked for nothing, expected nothing, and had no reason for\r\ncoming except curiosity. This attitude practically disarmed the witch\r\nand she began to regard the Skeezer in a more friendly way. She\r\nknitted for some time, seemingly in deep thought, and then she arose\r\nand walked to a big cupboard that stood against the wall of the room.\r\nWhen the cupboard door was opened Ervic could see a lot of drawers\r\ninside, and into one of these drawers--the second from the\r\nbottom--Reera thrust a hairy hand.\r\n\r\nUntil now Ervic could see over the bent form of the ape, but suddenly\r\nthe form, with its back to him, seemed to straighten up and blot out\r\nthe cupboard of drawers. The ape had changed to the form of a woman,\r\ndressed in the pretty Gillikin costume, and when she turned around he\r\nsaw that it was a young woman, whose face was quite attractive.\r\n\r\n\"Do you like me better this way?\" Reera inquired with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"You _look_ better,\" he said calmly, \"but I'm not sure I _like_ you\r\nany better.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed, saying: \"During the heat of the day I like to be an ape,\r\nfor an ape doesn't wear any clothes to speak of. But if one has\r\ngentlemen callers it is proper to dress up.\"\r\n\r\nErvic noticed her right hand was closed, as if she held something in\r\nit. She shut the cupboard door, bent over the crocodile and in a\r\nmoment the creature had changed to a red wolf. It was not pretty even\r\nnow, and the wolf crouched beside its mistress as a dog might have\r\ndone. Its teeth looked as dangerous as had those of the crocodile.\r\n\r\nNext the Yookoohoo went about touching all the lizards and toads, and\r\nat her touch they became kittens. The rats she changed into chipmunks.\r\nNow the only horrid creatures remaining were the four great spiders,\r\nwhich hid themselves behind their thick webs.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" Reera cried, \"now my cottage presents a more comfortable\r\nappearance. I love the toads and lizards and rats, because most people\r\nhate them, but I would tire of them if they always remained the same.\r\nSometimes I change their forms a dozen times a day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are clever,\" said Ervic. \"I did not hear you utter any\r\nincantations or magic words. All you did was to touch the creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do you think so?\" she replied. \"Well, touch them yourself, if you\r\nlike, and see if you can change their forms.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Skeezer, \"I don't understand magic and if I did I would\r\nnot try to imitate your skill. You are a wonderful Yookoohoo, while I\r\nam only a common Skeezer.\"\r\n\r\nThis confession seemed to please Reera, who liked to have her\r\nwitchcraft appreciated.\r\n\r\n\"Will you go away now?\" she asked. \"I prefer to be alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer to stay here,\" said Ervic.\r\n\r\n\"In another person's home, where you are not wanted?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is not your curiosity yet satisfied?\" demanded Reera, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Is there anything else you can do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Many things. But why should I exhibit my powers to a stranger?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can think of no reason at all,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him curiously.\r\n\r\n\"You want no power for yourself, you say, and you're too stupid to be\r\nable to steal my secrets. This isn't a pretty cottage, while outside\r\nare sunshine, broad prairies and beautiful wildflowers. Yet you insist\r\non sitting on that bench and annoying me with your unwelcome\r\npresence. What have you in that kettle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three fishes,\" he answered readily.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I caught them in the Lake of the Skeezers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you intend to do with the fishes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall carry them to the home of a friend of mine who has three\r\nchildren. The children will love to have the fishes for pets.\"\r\n\r\nShe came over to the bench and looked into the kettle, where the three\r\nfishes were swimming quietly in the water.\r\n\r\n\"They're pretty,\" said Reera. \"Let me transform them into something\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" objected the Skeezer.\r\n\r\n\"I love to transform things; it's so interesting. And I've never\r\ntransformed any fishes in all my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them alone,\" said Ervic.\r\n\r\n\"What shapes would you prefer them to have? I can make them turtles,\r\nor cute little sea-horses; or I could make them piglets, or rabbits,\r\nor guinea-pigs; or, if you like I can make chickens of them, or\r\neagles, or bluejays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them alone!\" repeated Ervic.\r\n\r\n\"You're not a very pleasant visitor,\" laughed Red Reera. \"People\r\naccuse _me_ of being cross and crabbed and unsociable, and they are\r\nquite right. If you had come here pleading and begging for favors, and\r\nhalf afraid of my Yookoohoo magic, I'd have abused you until you ran\r\naway; but you're quite different from that. _You're_ the unsociable\r\nand crabbed and disagreeable one, and so I like you, and bear with\r\nyour grumpiness. It's time for my midday meal; are you hungry?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Ervic, although he really desired food.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am,\" Reera declared and clapped her hands together. Instantly\r\na table appeared, spread with linen and bearing dishes of various\r\nfoods, some smoking hot. There were two plates laid, one at each end\r\nof the table, and as soon as Reera seated herself all her creatures\r\ngathered around her, as if they were accustomed to be fed when she\r\nate. The wolf squatted at her right hand and the kittens and chipmunks\r\ngathered at her left.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Stranger, sit down and eat,\" she called cheerfully, \"and while\r\nwe're eating let us decide into what forms we shall change your\r\nfishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're all right as they are,\" asserted Ervic, drawing up his bench\r\nto the table. \"The fishes are beauties--one gold, one silver and one\r\nbronze. Nothing that has life is more lovely than a beautiful fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Am _I_ not more lovely?\" Reera asked, smiling at his serious\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"I don't object to you--for a Yookoohoo, you know,\" he said, helping\r\nhimself to the food and eating with good appetite.\r\n\r\n\"And don't you consider a beautiful girl more lovely than a fish,\r\nhowever pretty the fish may be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Ervic, after a period of thought, \"that might be. If\r\nyou transformed my three fish into three girls--girls who would be\r\nAdepts at Magic, you know they might please me as well as the fish\r\ndo. You won't do that of course, because you can't, with all your\r\nskill. And, should you be able to do so, I fear my troubles would be\r\nmore than I could bear. They would not consent to be my\r\nslaves--especially if they were Adepts at Magic--and so they would\r\ncommand _me_ to obey _them_. No, Mistress Reera, let us not transform\r\nthe fishes at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe Skeezer had put his case with remarkable cleverness. He realized\r\nthat if he appeared anxious for such a transformation the Yookoohoo\r\nwould not perform it, yet he had skillfully suggested that they be\r\nmade Adepts at Magic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19\r\n\r\nRed Reera the Yookoohoo\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the meal was over and Reera had fed her pets, including the four\r\nmonster spiders which had come down from their webs to secure their\r\nshare, she made the table disappear from the floor of the cottage.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd consent to my transforming your fishes,\" she said, as\r\nshe took up her knitting again.\r\n\r\nThe Skeezer made no reply. He thought it unwise to hurry matters. All\r\nduring the afternoon they sat silent. Once Reera went to her cupboard\r\nand after thrusting her hand into the same drawer as before, touched\r\nthe wolf and transformed it into a bird with gorgeous colored\r\nfeathers. This bird was larger than a parrot and of a somewhat\r\ndifferent form, but Ervic had never seen one like it before.\r\n\r\n\"Sing!\" said Reera to the bird, which had perched itself on a big\r\nwooden peg--as if it had been in the cottage before and knew just what\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nAnd the bird sang jolly, rollicking songs with words to them--just as\r\na person who had been carefully trained might do. The songs were\r\nentertaining and Ervic enjoyed listening to them. In an hour or so the\r\nbird stopped singing, tucked its head under its wing and went to\r\nsleep. Reera continued knitting but seemed thoughtful.\r\n\r\nNow Ervic had marked this cupboard drawer well and had concluded that\r\nReera took something from it which enabled her to perform her\r\ntransformations. He thought that if he managed to remain in the\r\ncottage, and Reera fell asleep, he could slyly open the cupboard,\r\ntake a portion of whatever was in the drawer, and by dropping it into\r\nthe copper kettle transform the three fishes into their natural\r\nshapes. Indeed, he had firmly resolved to carry out this plan when the\r\nYookoohoo put down her knitting and walked toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going out for a few minutes,\" said she; \"do you wish to go with\r\nme, or will you remain here?\"\r\n\r\nErvic did not answer but sat quietly on his bench. So Reera went out\r\nand closed the cottage door.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was gone, Ervic rose and tiptoed to the cupboard.\r\n\r\n\"Take care! Take care!\" cried several voices, coming from the kittens\r\nand chipmunks. \"If you touch anything we'll tell the Yookoohoo!\"\r\n\r\nErvic hesitated a moment but, remembering that he need not consider\r\nReera's anger if he succeeded in transforming the fishes, he was about\r\nto open the cupboard when he was arrested by the voices of the fishes,\r\nwhich stuck their heads above the water in the kettle and called out:\r\n\r\n\"Come here, Ervic!\"\r\n\r\nSo he went back to the kettle and bent over it.\r\n\r\n\"Let the cupboard alone,\" said the goldfish to him earnestly. \"You\r\ncould not succeed by getting that magic powder, for only the Yookoohoo\r\nknows how to use it. The best way is to allow her to transform us into\r\nthree girls, for then we will have our natural shapes and be able to\r\nperform all the Arts of Magic we have learned and well understand. You\r\nare acting wisely and in the most effective manner. We did not know\r\nyou were so intelligent, or that Reera could be so easily deceived by\r\nyou. Continue as you have begun and try to persuade her to transform\r\nus. But insist that we be given the forms of girls.\"\r\n\r\nThe goldfish ducked its head down just as Reera re-entered the\r\ncottage. She saw Ervic bent over the kettle, so she came and joined\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Can your fishes talk?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes,\" he replied, \"for all fishes in the Land of Oz know how to\r\nspeak. Just now they were asking me for some bread. They are hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they can have some bread,\" said Reera. \"But it is nearly\r\nsupper-time, and if you would allow me to transform your fishes into\r\ngirls they could join us at the table and have plenty of food much\r\nnicer than crumbs. Why not let me transform them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Ervic, as if hesitating, \"ask the fishes. If they\r\nconsent, why--why, then, I'll think it over.\"\r\n\r\nReera bent over the kettle and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Can you hear me, little fishes?\"\r\n\r\nAll three popped their heads above water.\r\n\r\n\"We can hear you,\" said the bronzefish.\r\n\r\n\"I want to give you other forms, such as rabbits, or turtles or girls,\r\nor something; but your master, the surly Skeezer, does not wish me to.\r\nHowever, he has agreed to the plan if you will consent.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd like to be girls,\" said the silverfish.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" exclaimed Ervic.\r\n\r\n\"If you promise to make us three beautiful girls, we will consent,\"\r\nsaid the goldfish.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" exclaimed Ervic again.\r\n\r\n\"Also make us Adepts at Magic,\" added the bronzefish.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know exactly what that means,\" replied Reera musingly, \"but\r\nas no Adept at Magic is as powerful as Yookoohoo, I'll add that to the\r\ntransformation.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't try to harm you, or to interfere with your magic in any\r\nway,\" promised the goldfish. \"On the contrary, we will be your\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you agree to go away and leave me alone in my cottage, whenever\r\nI command you to do so?\" asked Reera.\r\n\r\n\"We promise that,\" cried the three fishes.\r\n\r\n\"Don't do it! Don't consent to the transformation,\" urged Ervic.\r\n\r\n\"They have already consented,\" said the Yookoohoo, laughing in his\r\nface, \"and you have promised me to abide by their decision. So, friend\r\nSkeezer, I shall perform the transformation whether you like it or\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nErvic seated himself on the bench again, a deep scowl on his face but\r\njoy in his heart. Reera moved over to the cupboard, took something\r\nfrom the drawer and returned to the copper kettle. She was clutching\r\nsomething tightly in her right hand, but with her left she reached\r\nwithin the kettle, took out the three fishes and laid them carefully\r\non the floor, where they gasped in distress at being out of water.\r\n\r\nReera did not keep them in misery more than a few seconds, for she\r\ntouched each one with her right hand and instantly the fishes were\r\ntransformed into three tall and slender young women, with fine,\r\nintelligent faces and clothed in handsome, clinging gowns. The one who\r\nhad been a goldfish had beautiful golden hair and blue eyes and was\r\nexceedingly fair of skin; the one who had been a bronzefish had dark\r\nbrown hair and clear gray eyes and her complexion matched these\r\nlovely features. The one who had been a silverfish had snow-white hair\r\nof the finest texture and deep brown eyes. The hair contrasted\r\nexquisitely with her pink cheeks and ruby-red lips, nor did it make\r\nher look a day older than her two companions.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they secured these girlish shapes, all three bowed low to\r\nthe Yookoohoo and said:\r\n\r\n\"We thank you, Reera.\"\r\n\r\nThen they bowed to the Skeezer and said:\r\n\r\n\"We thank you, Ervic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good!\" cried the Yookoohoo, examining her work with critical\r\napproval. \"You are much better and more interesting than fishes, and\r\nthis ungracious Skeezer would scarcely allow me to do the\r\ntransformations. You surely have nothing to thank _him_ for. But now\r\nlet us dine in honor of the occasion.\"\r\n\r\nShe clapped her hands together and again a table loaded with food\r\nappeared in the cottage. It was a longer table, this time, and places\r\nwere set for the three Adepts as well as for Reera and Ervic.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, friends, and eat your fill,\" said the Yookoohoo, but\r\ninstead of seating herself at the head of the table she went to the\r\ncupboard, saying to the Adepts: \"Your beauty and grace, my fair\r\nfriends, quite outshine my own. So that I may appear properly at the\r\nbanquet table I intend, in honor of this occasion, to take upon myself\r\nmy natural shape.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had she finished this speech when Reera transformed herself\r\ninto a young woman fully as lovely as the three Adepts. She was not\r\nquite so tall as they, but her form was more rounded and more\r\nhandsomely clothed, with a wonderful jeweled girdle and a necklace of\r\nshining pearls. Her hair was a bright auburn red, and her eyes large\r\nand dark.\r\n\r\n\"Do you claim this is your natural form?\" asked Ervic of the\r\nYookoohoo.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"This is the only form I am really entitled to\r\nwear. But I seldom assume it because there is no one here to admire or\r\nappreciate it and I get tired admiring it myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see now why you are named Reera the Red,\" remarked Ervic.\r\n\r\n\"It is on account of my red hair,\" she explained smiling. \"I do not\r\ncare for red hair myself, which is one reason I usually wear other\r\nforms.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is beautiful,\" asserted the young man; and then remembering the\r\nother women present he added: \"But, of course, all women should not\r\nhave red hair, because that would make it too common. Gold and silver\r\nand brown hair are equally handsome.\"\r\n\r\nThe smiles that he saw interchanged between the four filled the poor\r\nSkeezer with embarrassment, so he fell silent and attended to eating\r\nhis supper, leaving the others to do the talking. The three Adepts\r\nfrankly told Reera who they were, how they became fishes and how they\r\nhad planned secretly to induce the Yookoohoo to transform them. They\r\nadmitted that they had feared, had they asked her to help, that she\r\nwould have refused them.\r\n\r\n\"You were quite right,\" returned the Yookoohoo. \"I make it my rule\r\nnever to perform magic to assist others, for if I did there would\r\nalways be crowds at my cottage demanding help and I hate crowds and\r\nwant to be left alone.\r\n\r\n\"However, now that you are restored to your proper shapes, I do not\r\nregret my action and I hope you will be of use in saving the Skeezer\r\npeople by raising their island to the surface of the lake, where it\r\nreally belongs. But you must promise me that after you go away you\r\nwill never come here again, nor tell anyone what I have done for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe three Adepts and Ervic thanked the Yookoohoo warmly. They promised\r\nto remember her wish that they should not come to her cottage again\r\nand so, with a good-bye, took their departure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20\r\n\r\nA Puzzling Problem\r\n\r\n\r\nGlinda the Good, having decided to try her sorcery upon the abandoned\r\nsubmarine, so that it would obey her commands, asked all of her party,\r\nincluding the Skeezers, to withdraw from the shore of the lake to the\r\nline of palm trees. She kept with her only the little Wizard of Oz,\r\nwho was her pupil and knew how to assist her in her magic rites. When\r\nthey two were alone beside the stranded boat, Glinda said to the\r\nWizard:\r\n\r\n\"I shall first try my magic recipe No. 1163, which is intended to make\r\ninanimate objects move at my command. Have you a skeropythrope with\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I always carry one in my bag,\" replied the Wizard. He opened his\r\nblack bag of magic tools and took out a brightly polished\r\nskeropythrope, which he handed to the Sorceress. Glinda had also\r\nbrought a small wicker bag, containing various requirements of\r\nsorcery, and from this she took a parcel of powder and a vial of\r\nliquid. She poured the liquid into the skeropythrope and added the\r\npowder. At once the skeropythrope began to sputter and emit sparks of\r\na violet color, which spread in all directions. The Sorceress\r\ninstantly stepped into the middle of the boat and held the instrument\r\nso that the sparks fell all around her and covered every bit of the\r\nblackened steel boat. At the same time Glinda crooned a weird\r\nincantation in the language of sorcery, her voice sounding low and\r\nmusical.\r\n\r\nAfter a little the violet sparks ceased, and those that had fallen\r\nupon the boat had disappeared and left no mark upon its surface. The\r\nceremony was ended and Glinda returned the skeropythrope to the\r\nWizard, who put it away in his black bag.\r\n\r\n\"That ought to do the business all right,\" he said confidently.\r\n\r\n\"Let us make a trial and see,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nSo they both entered the boat and seated themselves.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in a tone of command the Sorceress said to the boat: \"Carry\r\nus across the lake, to the farther shore.\"\r\n\r\nAt once the boat backed off the sandy beach, turned its prow and moved\r\nswiftly over the water.\r\n\r\n\"Very good--very good indeed!\" cried the Wizard, when the boat slowed\r\nup at the shore opposite from that whence they had departed. \"Even\r\nCoo-ee-oh, with all her witchcraft, could do no better.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sorceress now said to the boat:\r\n\r\n\"Close up, submerge and carry us to the basement door of the sunken\r\nisland--the door from which you emerged at the command of Queen\r\nCoo-ee-oh.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat obeyed. As it sank into the water the top sections rose from\r\nthe sides and joined together over the heads of Glinda and the Wizard,\r\nwho were thus enclosed in a water-proof chamber. There were four\r\nglass windows in this covering, one on each side and one on either\r\nend, so that the passengers could see exactly where they were going.\r\nMoving under water more slowly than on the surface, the submarine\r\ngradually approached the island and halted with its bow pressed\r\nagainst the huge marble door in the basement under the Dome. This door\r\nwas tightly closed and it was evident to both Glinda and the Wizard\r\nthat it would not open to admit the under-water boat unless a magic\r\nword was spoken by them or someone from within the basement of the\r\nisland. But what was this magic word? Neither of them knew.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid,\" said the Wizard regretfully, \"that we can't get in,\r\nafter all. Unless your sorcery can discover the word to open the\r\nmarble door.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is probably some word only known to Coo-ee-oh,\" replied the\r\nSorceress. \"I may be able to discover what it is, but that will\r\nrequire time. Let us go back again to our companions.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems a shame, after we have made the boat obey us, to be balked\r\nby just a marble door,\" grumbled the Wizard.\r\n\r\nAt Glinda's command the boat rose until it was on a level with the\r\nglass dome that covered the Skeezer village, when the Sorceress made\r\nit slowly circle all around the Great Dome.\r\n\r\nMany faces were pressed against the glass from the inside, eagerly\r\nwatching the submarine, and in one place were Dorothy and Ozma, who\r\nquickly recognized Glinda and the Wizard through the glass windows of\r\nthe boat. Glinda saw them, too, and held the boat close to the Dome\r\nwhile the friends exchanged greetings in pantomime. Their voices,\r\nunfortunately, could not be heard through the Dome and the water and\r\nthe side of the boat. The Wizard tried to make the girls understand,\r\nthrough signs, that he and Glinda had come to their rescue, and Ozma\r\nand Dorothy understood this from the very fact that the Sorceress and\r\nthe Wizard had appeared. The two girl prisoners were smiling and in\r\nsafety, and knowing this Glinda felt she could take all the time\r\nnecessary in order to effect their final rescue.\r\n\r\nAs nothing more could be done just then, Glinda ordered the boat to\r\nreturn to shore, and it obeyed readily. First it ascended to the\r\nsurface of the water, then the roof parted and fell into the slots at\r\nthe side of the boat, and then the magic craft quickly made the shore\r\nand beached itself on the sands at the very spot from which it had\r\ndeparted at Glinda's command.\r\n\r\nAll the Oz people and the Skeezers at once ran to the boat to ask if\r\nthey had reached the island, and whether they had seen Ozma and\r\nDorothy. The Wizard told them of the obstacle they had met in the way\r\nof a marble door, and how Glinda would now undertake to find a magic\r\nway to conquer the door.\r\n\r\nRealizing that it would require several days to succeed in reaching\r\nthe island, raising it and liberating their friends and the Skeezer\r\npeople, Glinda now prepared a camp half way between the lake shore and\r\nthe palm trees.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard's wizardry made a number of tents appear and the sorcery of\r\nthe Sorceress furnished these tents all complete, with beds, chairs,\r\ntables, rugs, lamps and even books with which to pass idle hours. All\r\nthe tents had the Royal Banner of Oz flying from the centerpoles and\r\none big tent, not now occupied, had Ozma's own banner moving in the\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\nBetsy and Trot had a tent to themselves, and Button Bright and Ojo had\r\nanother. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman paired together in one tent\r\nand so did Jack Pumpkinhead and the Shaggy Man, Cap'n Bill and Uncle\r\nHenry, Tik-Tok and Professor Wogglebug. Glinda had the most splendid\r\ntent of all, except that reserved for Ozma, while the Wizard had a\r\nlittle one of his own. Whenever it was meal time, tables loaded with\r\nfood magically appeared in the tents of those who were in the habit of\r\neating, and these complete arrangements made the rescue party just as\r\ncomfortable as they would have been in their own homes.\r\n\r\nFar into the night Glinda sat in her tent studying a roll of mystic\r\nscrolls in search of a word that would open the basement door of the\r\nisland and admit her to the Great Dome. She also made many magical\r\nexperiments, hoping to discover something that would aid her. Yet the\r\nmorning found the powerful Sorceress still unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nGlinda's art could have opened any ordinary door, you may be sure, but\r\nyou must realize that this marble door of the island had been\r\ncommanded not to open save in obedience to one magic word, and\r\ntherefore all other magic words could have no effect upon it. The\r\nmagic word that guarded the door had probably been invented by\r\nCoo-ee-oh, who had now forgotten it. The only way, then, to gain\r\nentrance to the sunken island was to break the charm that held the\r\ndoor fast shut. If this could be done no magic would be required to\r\nopen it.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Sorceress and the Wizard again entered the boat and\r\nmade it submerge and go to the marble door, which they tried in\r\nvarious ways to open, but without success.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to abandon this attempt, I think,\" said Glinda. \"The\r\neasiest way to raise the island would be for us to gain admittance to\r\nthe Dome and then descend to the basement and see in what manner\r\nCoo-ee-oh made the entire island sink or rise at her command. It\r\nnaturally occurred to me that the easiest way to gain admittance\r\nwould be by having the boat take us into the basement through the\r\nmarble door from which Coo-ee-oh launched it. But there must be other\r\nways to get inside the Dome and join Ozma and Dorothy, and such ways\r\nwe must find by study and the proper use of our powers of magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't be easy,\" declared the Wizard, \"for we must not forget that\r\nOzma herself understands considerable magic, and has doubtless tried\r\nto raise the island or find other means of escape from it and failed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" returned Glinda, \"but Ozma's magic is fairy magic,\r\nwhile you are a Wizard and I am a Sorceress. In this way the three of\r\nus have a great variety of magic to work with, and if we should all\r\nfail it will be because the island is raised and lowered by a magic\r\npower none of us is acquainted with. My idea therefore is to seek--by\r\nsuch magic as we possess--to accomplish our object in another way.\"\r\n\r\nThey made the circle of the Dome again in their boat, and once more\r\nsaw Ozma and Dorothy through their windows and exchanged signals with\r\nthe two imprisoned girls.\r\n\r\nOzma realized that her friends were doing all in their power to rescue\r\nher and smiled an encouragement to their efforts. Dorothy seemed a\r\nlittle anxious but was trying to be as brave as her companion.\r\n\r\nAfter the boat had returned to the camp and Glinda was seated in her\r\ntent, working out various ways by which Ozma and Dorothy could be\r\nrescued, the Wizard stood on the shore dreamily eying the outlines of\r\nthe Great Dome which showed beneath the clear water, when he raised\r\nhis eyes and saw a group of strange people approaching from around the\r\nlake. Three were young women of stately presence, very beautifully\r\ndressed, who moved with remarkable grace. They were followed at a\r\nlittle distance by a good-looking young Skeezer.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard saw at a glance that these people might be very important,\r\nso he advanced to meet them. The three maidens received him graciously\r\nand the one with the golden hair said:\r\n\r\n\"I believe you are the famous Wizard of Oz, of whom I have often\r\nheard. We are seeking Glinda, the Sorceress, and perhaps you can lead\r\nus to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can, and will, right gladly,\" answered the Wizard. \"Follow me,\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\nThe little Wizard was puzzled as to the identity of the three lovely\r\nvisitors but he gave no sign that might embarrass them.\r\n\r\nHe understood they did not wish to be questioned, and so he made no\r\nremarks as he led the way to Glinda's tent.\r\n\r\nWith a courtly bow the Wizard ushered the three visitors into the\r\ngracious presence of Glinda, the Good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21\r\n\r\nThe Three Adepts\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sorceress looked up from her work as the three maidens entered,\r\nand something in their appearance and manner led her to rise and bow\r\nto them in her most dignified manner.\r\n\r\nThe three knelt an instant before the great Sorceress and then stood\r\nupright and waited for her to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever you may be,\" said Glinda, \"I bid you welcome.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Audah,\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Aurah,\" said another.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Aujah,\" said the third.\r\n\r\nGlinda had never heard these names before, but looking closely at the\r\nthree she asked:\r\n\r\n\"Are you witches or workers in magic?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of the secret arts we have gleaned from Nature,\" replied the\r\nbrownhaired maiden modestly, \"but we do not place our skill beside\r\nthat of the Great Sorceress, Glinda the Good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you are aware it is unlawful to practice magic in the Land\r\nof Oz, without the permission of our Ruler, Princess Ozma?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we were not aware of that,\" was the reply. \"We have heard of\r\nOzma, who is the appointed Ruler of all this great fairyland, but her\r\nlaws have not reached us, as yet.\"\r\n\r\nGlinda studied the strange maidens thoughtfully; then she said to\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n\"Princess Ozma is even now imprisoned in the Skeezer village, for the\r\nwhole island with its Great Dome, was sunk to the bottom of the lake\r\nby the witchcraft of Coo-ee-oh, whom the Flathead Su-dic transformed\r\ninto a silly swan. I am seeking some way to overcome Coo-ee-oh's magic\r\nand raise the isle to the surface again. Can you help me do this?\"\r\n\r\nThe maidens exchanged glances, and the white-haired one replied\r\n\r\n\"We do not know; but we will try to assist you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems,\" continued Glinda musingly, \"that Coo-ee-oh derived most of\r\nher witchcraft from three Adepts at Magic, who at one time ruled the\r\nFlatheads. While the Adepts were being entertained by Coo-ee-oh at a\r\nbanquet in her palace, she cruelly betrayed them and after\r\ntransforming them into fishes cast them into the lake.\r\n\r\n\"If I could find these three fishes and return them to their natural\r\nshapes--they might know what magic Coo-ee-oh used to sink the island.\r\nI was about to go to the shore and call these fishes to me when you\r\narrived. So, if you will join me, we will try to find them.\"\r\n\r\nThe maidens exchanged smiles now, and the golden-haired one, Audah,\r\nsaid to Glinda:\r\n\r\n\"It will not be necessary to go to the lake. We are the three\r\nfishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" cried Glinda. \"Then you are the three Adepts at Magic,\r\nrestored to your proper forms?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are the three Adepts,\" admitted Aujah.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Glinda, \"my task is half accomplished. But who destroyed\r\nthe transformation that made you fishes?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have promised not to tell,\" answered Aurah; \"but this young\r\nSkeezer was largely responsible for our release; he is brave and\r\nclever, and we owe him our gratitude.\"\r\n\r\nGlinda looked at Ervic, who stood modestly behind the Adepts, hat in\r\nhand. \"He shall be properly rewarded,\" she declared, \"for in helping\r\nyou he has helped us all, and perhaps saved his people from being\r\nimprisoned forever in the sunken isle.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sorceress now asked her guests to seat themselves and a long talk\r\nfollowed, in which the Wizard of Oz shared.\r\n\r\n\"We are quite certain,\" said Aurah, \"that if we could get inside the\r\nDome we could discover Coo-ee-oh's secrets, for in all her work, after\r\nwe became fishes, she used the formulas and incantations and arts that\r\nshe stole from us. She may have added to these things, but they were\r\nthe foundation of all her work.\"\r\n\r\n\"What means do you suggest for our getting into the Dome?\" inquired\r\nGlinda.\r\n\r\nThe three Adepts hesitated to reply, for they had not yet considered\r\nwhat could be done to reach the inside of the Great Dome. While they\r\nwere in deep thought, and Glinda and the Wizard were quietly awaiting\r\ntheir suggestions, into the tent rushed Trot and Betsy, dragging\r\nbetween them the Patchwork Girl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Glinda,\" cried Trot, \"Scraps has thought of a way to rescue Ozma\r\nand Dorothy and all of the Skeezers.\"\r\n\r\nThe three Adepts could not avoid laughing merrily, for not only were\r\nthey amused by the queer form of the Patchwork Girl, but Trot's\r\nenthusiastic speech struck them as really funny. If the Great\r\nSorceress and the famous Wizard and the three talented Adepts at Magic\r\nwere unable as yet to solve the important problem of the sunken isle,\r\nthere was little chance for a patched girl stuffed with cotton to\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nBut Glinda, smiling indulgently at the earnest faces turned toward\r\nher, patted the children's heads and said:\r\n\r\n\"Scraps is very clever. Tell us what she has thought of, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Trot, \"Scraps says that if you could dry up all the\r\nwater in the lake the island would be on dry land, an' everyone could\r\ncome and go whenever they liked.\"\r\n\r\nGlinda smiled again, but the Wizard said to the girls:\r\n\r\n\"If we should dry up the lake, what would become of all the beautiful\r\nfishes that now live in the water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me! That's so,\" admitted Betsy, crestfallen; \"we never thought\r\nof that, did we Trot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you transform 'em into polliwogs?\" asked Scraps, turning a\r\nsomersault and then standing on one leg. \"You could give them a\r\nlittle, teeny pond to swim in, and they'd be just as happy as they are\r\nas fishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"No indeed!\" replied the Wizard, severely. \"It is wicked to transform\r\nany living creatures without their consent, and the lake is the home\r\nof the fishes and belongs to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Scraps, making a face at him; \"I don't care.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's too bad,\" sighed Trot, \"for I thought we'd struck a splendid\r\nidea.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you did,\" declared Glinda, her face now grave and thoughtful.\r\n\"There is something in the Patchwork Girl's idea that may be of real\r\nvalue to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so, too,\" agreed the golden-haired Adept. \"The top of the\r\nGreat Dome is only a few feet below the surface of the water. If we\r\ncould reduce the level of the lake until the Dome sticks a little\r\nabove the water, we could remove some of the glass and let ourselves\r\ndown into the village by means of ropes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there would be plenty of water left for the fishes to swim in,\"\r\nadded the white-haired maiden.\r\n\r\n\"If we succeed in raising the island we could fill up the lake again,\"\r\nsuggested the brown-haired Adept.\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" said the Wizard, rubbing his hands together in delight,\r\n\"that the Patchwork Girl, has shown us the way to success.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls were looking curiously at the three beautiful Adepts,\r\nwondering who they were, so Glinda introduced them to Trot and Betsy\r\nand Scraps, and then sent the children away while she considered how\r\nto carry the new idea into effect.\r\n\r\nNot much could be done that night, so the Wizard prepared another tent\r\nfor the Adepts, and in the evening Glinda held a reception and invited\r\nall her followers to meet the new arrivals. The Adepts were greatly\r\nastonished at the extraordinary personages presented to them, and\r\nmarveled that Jack Pumpkinhead and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman\r\nand Tik-Tok could really live and think and talk just like other\r\npeople. They were especially pleased with the lively Patchwork Girl\r\nand loved to watch her antics.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a pleasant party, for Glinda served some dainty\r\nrefreshments to those who could eat, and the Scarecrow recited some\r\npoems, and the Cowardly Lion sang a song in his deep bass voice. The\r\nonly thing that marred their joy was the thought that their beloved\r\nOzma and dear little Dorothy were yet confined in the Great Dome of\r\nthe Sunken Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22\r\n\r\nThe Sunken Island\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had breakfasted the next morning, Glinda and the\r\nWizard and the three Adepts went down to the shore of the lake and\r\nformed a line with their faces toward the submerged island. All the\r\nothers came to watch them, but stood at a respectful distance in the\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nAt the right of the Sorceress stood Audah and Aurah, while at the left\r\nstood the Wizard and Aujah. Together they stretched their arms over\r\nthe water's edge and in unison the five chanted a rhythmic\r\nincantation.\r\n\r\nThis chant they repeated again and again, swaying their arms gently\r\nfrom side to side, and in a few minutes the watchers behind them\r\nnoticed that the lake had begun to recede from the shore. Before long\r\nthe highest point of the dome appeared above the water. Gradually the\r\nwater fell, making the dome appear to rise. When it was three or four\r\nfeet above the surface Glinda gave the signal to stop, for their work\r\nhad been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe blackened submarine was now entirely out of water, but Uncle Henry\r\nand Cap'n Bill managed to push it into the lake. Glinda, the Wizard,\r\nErvic and the Adepts got into the boat, taking with them a coil of\r\nstrong rope, and at the command of the Sorceress the craft cleaved its\r\nway through the water toward the part of the Dome which was now\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\n\"There's still plenty of water for the fish to swim in,\" observed the\r\nWizard as they rode along. \"They might like more but I'm sure they can\r\nget along until we have raised the island and can fill up the lake\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat touched gently on the sloping glass of the Dome, and the\r\nWizard took some tools from his black bag and quickly removed one\r\nlarge pane of glass, thus making a hole large enough for their bodies\r\nto pass through. Stout frames of steel supported the glass of the\r\nDome, and around one of these frames the Wizard tied the end of a\r\nrope.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go down first,\" said he, \"for while I'm not as spry as Cap'n\r\nBill I'm sure I can manage it easily. Are you sure the rope is long\r\nenough to reach the bottom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure,\" replied the Sorceress.\r\n\r\nSo the Wizard let down the rope and climbing through the opening\r\nlowered himself down, hand over hand, clinging to the rope with his\r\nlegs and feet. Below in the streets of the village were gathered all\r\nthe Skeezers, men, women and children, and you may be sure that Ozma\r\nand Dorothy, with Lady Aurex, were filled with joy that their friends\r\nwere at last coming to their rescue.\r\n\r\nThe Queen's palace, now occupied by Ozma, was directly in the center\r\nof the Dome, so that when the rope was let down the end of it came\r\njust in front of the palace entrance. Several Skeezers held fast to\r\nthe rope's end to steady it and the Wizard reached the ground in\r\nsafety. He hugged first Ozma and then Dorothy, while all the Skeezers\r\ncheered as loud as they could.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard now discovered that the rope was long enough to reach from\r\nthe top of the Dome to the ground when doubled, so he tied a chair to\r\none end of the rope and called to Glinda to sit in the chair while he\r\nand some of the Skeezers lowered her to the pavement. In this way the\r\nSorceress reached the ground quite comfortably and the three Adepts\r\nand Ervic soon followed her.\r\n\r\nThe Skeezers quickly recognized the three Adepts at Magic, whom they\r\nhad learned to respect before their wicked Queen betrayed them, and\r\nwelcomed them as friends. All the inhabitants of the village had been\r\ngreatly frightened by their imprisonment under water, but now realized\r\nthat an attempt was to be made to rescue them.\r\n\r\nGlinda, the Wizard and the Adepts followed Ozma and Dorothy into the\r\npalace, and they asked Lady Aurex and Ervic to join them. After Ozma\r\nhad told of her adventures in trying to prevent war between the\r\nFlatheads and the Skeezers, and Glinda had told all about the Rescue\r\nExpedition and the restoration of the three Adepts by the help of\r\nErvic, a serious consultation was held as to how the island could be\r\nmade to rise.\r\n\r\n\"I've tried every way in my power,\" said Ozma, \"but Coo-ee-oh used a\r\nvery unusual sort of magic which I do not understand. She seems to\r\nhave prepared her witchcraft in such a way that a spoken word is\r\nnecessary to accomplish her designs, and these spoken words are known\r\nonly to herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a method we taught her,\" declared Aurah the Adept.\r\n\r\n\"I can do no more, Glinda,\" continued Ozma, \"so I wish you would try\r\nwhat your sorcery can accomplish.\"\r\n\r\n\"First, then,\" said Glinda, \"let us visit the basement of the island,\r\nwhich I am told is underneath the village.\"\r\n\r\nA flight of marble stairs led from one of Coo-ee-oh's private rooms\r\ndown to the basement, but when the party arrived all were puzzled by\r\nwhat they saw. In the center of a broad, low room, stood a mass of\r\ngreat cog-wheels, chains and pulleys, all interlocked and seeming to\r\nform a huge machine; but there was no engine or other motive power to\r\nmake the wheels turn.\r\n\r\n\"This, I suppose, is the means by which the island is lowered or\r\nraised,\" said Ozma, \"but the magic word which is needed to move the\r\nmachinery is unknown to us.\"\r\n\r\nThe three Adepts were carefully examining the mass of wheels, and soon\r\nthe golden-haired one said:\r\n\r\n\"These wheels do not control the island at all. On the contrary, one\r\nset of them is used to open the doors of the little rooms where the\r\nsubmarines are kept, as may be seen from the chains and pulleys used.\r\nEach boat is kept in a little room with two doors, one to the basement\r\nroom where we are now and the other letting into the lake.\r\n\r\n\"When Coo-ee-oh used the boat in which she attacked the Flatheads, she\r\nfirst commanded the basement door to open and with her followers she\r\ngot into the boat and made the top close over them. Then the basement\r\ndoor being closed, the outer door was slowly opened, letting the water\r\nfill the room to float the boat, which then left the island, keeping\r\nunder water.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how could she expect to get back again?\" asked the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"Why the boat would enter the room filled with water and after the\r\nouter door was closed a word of command started a pump which pumped\r\nall the water from the room. Then the boat would open and Coo-ee-oh\r\ncould enter the basement.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said the Wizard. \"It is a clever contrivance, but won't work\r\nunless one knows the magic words.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another part of this machinery,\" explained the white-haired Adept,\r\n\"is used to extend the bridge from the island to the mainland. The\r\nsteel bridge is in a room much like that in which the boats are kept,\r\nand at Coo-ee-oh's command it would reach out, joint by joint, until\r\nits far end touched the shore of the lake. The same magic command\r\nwould make the bridge return to its former position. Of course the\r\nbridge could not be used unless the island was on the surface of the\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how do you suppose Coo-ee-oh managed to sink the island, and make\r\nit rise again?\" inquired Glinda.\r\n\r\nThis the Adepts could not yet explain. As nothing more could be\r\nlearned from the basement they mounted the steps to the Queen's\r\nprivate suite again, and Ozma showed them to a special room where\r\nCoo-ee-oh kept her magical instruments and performed all her arts of\r\nwitchcraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 23\r\n\r\nThe Magic Words\r\n\r\n\r\nMany interesting things were to be seen in the Room of Magic,\r\nincluding much that had been stolen from the Adepts when they were\r\ntransformed to fishes, but they had to admit that Coo-ee-oh had a\r\nrare genius for mechanics, and had used her knowledge in inventing a\r\nlot of mechanical apparatus that ordinary witches, wizards and\r\nsorcerers could not understand.\r\n\r\nThey all carefully inspected this room, taking care to examine every\r\narticle they came across.\r\n\r\n\"The island,\" said Glinda thoughtfully, \"rests on a base of solid\r\nmarble. When it is submerged, as it is now, the base of the island is\r\nupon the bottom of the lake. What puzzles me is how such a great\r\nweight can be lifted and suspended in the water, even by magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"I now remember,\" returned Aujah, \"that one of the arts we taught\r\nCoo-ee-oh was the way to expand steel, and I think that explains how\r\nthe island is raised and lowered. I noticed in the basement a big\r\nsteel pillar that passed through the floor and extended upward to this\r\npalace. Perhaps the end of it is concealed in this very room. If the\r\nlower end of the steel pillar is firmly embedded in the bottom of the\r\nlake, Coo-ee-oh could utter a magic word that would make the pillar\r\nexpand, and so lift the entire island to the level of the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've found the end of the steel pillar. It's just here,\" announced\r\nthe Wizard, pointing to one side of the room where a great basin of\r\npolished steel seemed to have been set upon the floor.\r\n\r\nThey all gathered around, and Ozma said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am quite sure that is the upper end of the pillar that\r\nsupports the island. I noticed it when I first came here. It has been\r\nhollowed out, you see, and something has been burned in the basin, for\r\nthe fire has left its marks. I wondered what was under the great basin\r\nand got several of the Skeezers to come up here and try to lift it for\r\nme. They were strong men, but could not move it at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said Audah the Adept, \"that we have discovered the\r\nmanner in which Coo-ee-oh raised the island. She would burn some sort\r\nof magic powder in the basin, utter the magic word, and the pillar\r\nwould lengthen out and lift the island with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's this?\" asked Dorothy, who had been searching around with the\r\nothers, and now noticed a slight hollow in the wall, near to where the\r\nsteel basin stood. As she spoke Dorothy pushed her thumb into the\r\nhollow and instantly a small drawer popped out from the wall.\r\n\r\nThe three Adepts, Glinda and the Wizard sprang forward and peered into\r\nthe drawer. It was half filled with a grayish powder, the tiny grains\r\nof which constantly moved as if impelled by some living force.\r\n\r\n\"It may be some kind of radium,\" said the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Glinda, \"it is more wonderful than even radium, for I\r\nrecognize it as a rare mineral powder called Gaulau by the sorcerers.\r\nI wonder how Coo-ee-oh discovered it and where she obtained it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no doubt,\" said Aujah the Adept, \"that this is the magic\r\npowder Coo-ee-oh burned in the basin. If only we knew the magic word,\r\nI am quite sure we could raise the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we discover the magic word?\" asked Ozma, turning to Glinda\r\nas she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"That we must now seriously consider,\" answered the Sorceress.\r\n\r\nSo all of them sat down in the Room of Magic and began to think. It\r\nwas so still that after a while Dorothy grew nervous. The little girl\r\nnever could keep silent for long, and at the risk of displeasing her\r\nmagic-working friends she suddenly said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Coo-ee-oh used just three magic words, one to make the bridge\r\nwork, and one to make the submarines go out of their holes, and one to\r\nraise and lower the island. Three words. And Coo-ee-oh's name is made\r\nup of just three words. One is 'Coo,' and one is 'ee,' and one is\r\n'oh.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Wizard frowned but Glinda looked wonderingly at the young girl and\r\nOzma cried out:\r\n\r\n\"A good thought, Dorothy dear! You may have solved our problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it is worth a trial,\" agreed Glinda. \"It would be quite\r\nnatural for Coo-ee-oh to divide her name into three magic syllables,\r\nand Dorothy's suggestion seems like an inspiration.\"\r\n\r\nThe three Adepts also approved the trial but the brown-haired one\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"We must be careful not to use the wrong word, and send the bridge\r\nout under water. The main thing, if Dorothy's idea is correct, is to\r\nhit upon the one word that moves the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us experiment,\" suggested the Wizard.\r\n\r\nIn the drawer with the moving gray powder was a tiny golden cup, which\r\nthey thought was used for measuring. Glinda filled this cup with the\r\npowder and carefully poured it into the shallow basin, which was the\r\ntop of the great steel pillar supporting the island. Then Aurah the\r\nAdept lighted a taper and touched it to the powder, which instantly\r\nglowed fiery red and tumbled about the basin with astonishing energy.\r\nWhile the grains of powder still glowed red the Sorceress bent over it\r\nand said in a voice of command: \"Coo!\"\r\n\r\nThey waited motionless to see what would happen. There was a grating\r\nnoise and a whirl of machinery, but the island did not move a\r\nparticle.\r\n\r\nDorothy rushed to the window, which overlooked the glass side of the\r\ndome.\r\n\r\n\"The boats!\" she exclaimed. \"The boats are all loose an' sailing under\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've made a mistake,\" said the Wizard gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"But it's one which shows we are on the right track,\" declared Aujah\r\nthe Adept. \"We know now that Coo-ee-oh used the syllables of her name\r\nfor the magic words.\"\r\n\r\n\"If 'Coo' sends out the boats, it is probable that 'ee' works the\r\nbridge,\" suggested Ozma. \"So the last part of the name may raise the\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us try that next then,\" proposed the Wizard.\r\n\r\nHe scraped the embers of the burned powder out of the basin and Glinda\r\nagain filled the golden cup from the drawer and placed it on top the\r\nsteel pillar. Aurah lighted it with her taper and Ozma bent over the\r\nbasin and murmured the long drawn syllable: \"Oh-h-h!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly the island trembled and with a weird groaning noise it moved\r\nupward--slowly, very slowly, but with a steady motion, while all the\r\ncompany stood by in awed silence. It was a wonderful thing, even to\r\nthose skilled in the arts of magic, wizardry and sorcery, to realize\r\nthat a single word could raise that great, heavy island, with its\r\nimmense glass Dome.\r\n\r\n\"Why, we're way _above_ the lake now!\" exclaimed Dorothy from the\r\nwindow, when at last the island ceased to move.\r\n\r\n\"That is because we lowered the level of the water,\" explained Glinda.\r\n\r\nThey could hear the Skeezers cheering lustily in the streets of the\r\nvillage as they realized that they were saved.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said Ozma eagerly, \"let us go down and join the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not just yet,\" returned Glinda, a happy smile upon her lovely face,\r\nfor she was overjoyed at their success. \"First let us extend the\r\nbridge to the mainland, where our friends from the Emerald City are\r\nwaiting.\"\r\n\r\nIt didn't take long to put more powder in the basin, light it and\r\nutter the syllable \"EE!\" The result was that a door in the basement\r\nopened and the steel bridge moved out, extended itself joint by joint,\r\nand finally rested its far end on the shore of the lake just in front\r\nof the encampment.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Glinda, \"we can go up and receive the congratulations of\r\nthe Skeezers and of our friends of the Rescue Expedition.\"\r\n\r\nAcross the water, on the shore of the lake, the Patchwork Girl was\r\nwaving them a welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 24\r\n\r\nGlinda's Triumph\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course all those who had joined Glinda's expedition at once crossed\r\nthe bridge to the island, where they were warmly welcomed by the\r\nSkeezers. Before all the concourse of people Princess Ozma made a\r\nspeech from a porch of the palace and demanded that they recognize her\r\nas their lawful Ruler and promise to obey the laws of the Land of Oz.\r\nIn return she agreed to protect them from all future harm and declared\r\nthey would no longer be subjected to cruelty and abuse.\r\n\r\nThis pleased the Skeezers greatly, and when Ozma told them they might\r\nelect a Queen to rule over them, who in turn would be subject to Ozma\r\nof Oz, they voted for Lady Aurex, and that same day the ceremony of\r\ncrowning the new Queen was held and Aurex was installed as mistress of\r\nthe palace.\r\n\r\nFor her Prime Minister the Queen selected Ervic, for the three Adepts\r\nhad told of his good judgment, faithfulness and cleverness, and all\r\nthe Skeezers approved the appointment.\r\n\r\nGlinda, the Wizard and the Adepts stood on the bridge and recited an\r\nincantation that quite filled the lake with water again, and the\r\nScarecrow and the Patchwork Girl climbed to the top of the Great Dome\r\nand replaced the pane of glass that had been removed to allow Glinda\r\nand her followers to enter.\r\n\r\nWhen evening came Ozma ordered a great feast prepared, to which every\r\nSkeezer was invited. The village was beautifully decorated and\r\nbrilliantly lighted and there was music and dancing until a late hour\r\nto celebrate the liberation of the people. For the Skeezers had been\r\nfreed, not only from the water of the lake but from the cruelty of\r\ntheir former Queen.\r\n\r\nAs the people from the Emerald City prepared the next morning to\r\ndepart Queen Aurex said to Ozma:\r\n\r\n\"There is only one thing I now fear for my people, and that is the\r\nenmity of the terrible Su-dic of the Flatheads. He is liable to come\r\nhere at any time and try to annoy us, and my Skeezers are peaceful\r\nfolks and unable to fight the wild and wilful Flatheads.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not worry,\" returned Ozma, reassuringly. \"We intend to stop on our\r\nway at the Flatheads' Enchanted Mountain and punish the Su-dic for his\r\nmisdeeds.\"\r\n\r\nThat satisfied Aurex and when Ozma and her followers trooped over the\r\nbridge to the shore, having taken leave of their friends, all the\r\nSkeezers cheered them and waved their hats and handkerchiefs, and the\r\nband played and the departure was indeed a ceremony long to be\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nThe three Adepts at Magic, who had formerly ruled the Flatheads wisely\r\nand considerately, went with Princess Ozma and her people, for they\r\nhad promised Ozma to stay on the mountain and again see that the laws\r\nwere enforced.\r\n\r\nGlinda had been told all about the curious Flatheads and she had\r\nconsulted with the Wizard and formed a plan to render them more\r\nintelligent and agreeable.\r\n\r\nWhen the party reached the mountain Ozma and Dorothy showed them how\r\nto pass around the invisible wall--which had been built by the\r\nFlatheads after the Adepts were transformed--and how to gain the\r\nup-and-down stairway that led to the mountain top.\r\n\r\nThe Su-dic had watched the approach of the party from the edge of the\r\nmountain and was frightened when he saw that the three Adepts had\r\nrecovered their natural forms and were coming back to their former\r\nhome. He realized that his power would soon be gone and yet he\r\ndetermined to fight to the last. He called all the Flatheads together\r\nand armed them, and told them to arrest all who came up the stairway\r\nand hurl them over the edge of the mountain to the plain below. But\r\nalthough they feared the Supreme Dictator, who had threatened to\r\npunish them if they did not obey his commands, as soon as they saw the\r\nthree Adepts they threw down their arms and begged their former rulers\r\nto protect them.\r\n\r\nThe three Adepts assured the excited Flatheads that they had nothing\r\nto fear.\r\n\r\nSeeing that his people had rebelled the Su-dic ran away and tried to\r\nhide, but the Adepts found him and had him cast into a prison, all his\r\ncans of brains being taken away from him.\r\n\r\nAfter this easy conquest of the Su-dic, Glinda told the Adepts of her\r\nplan, which had already been approved by Ozma of Oz, and they joyfully\r\nagreed to it. So, during the next few days, the great Sorceress\r\ntransformed, in a way, every Flathead on the mountain.\r\n\r\nTaking them one at a time, she had the can of brains that belonged to\r\neach one opened and the contents spread on the flat head, after which,\r\nby means of her arts of sorcery, she caused the head to grow over the\r\nbrains--in the manner most people wear them--and they were thus\r\nrendered as intelligent and good looking as any of the other\r\ninhabitants of the Land of Oz.\r\n\r\nWhen all had been treated in this manner there were no more Flatheads\r\nat all, and the Adepts decided to name their people Mountaineers. One\r\ngood result of Glinda's sorcery was that no one could now be deprived\r\nof the brains that belonged to him and each person had exactly the\r\nshare he was entitled to.\r\n\r\nEven the Su-dic was given his portion of brains and his flat head\r\nmade round, like the others, but he was deprived of all power to work\r\nfurther mischief, and with the Adepts constantly watching him he would\r\nbe forced to become obedient and humble.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Pig, which ran grunting about the streets, with no brains\r\nat all, was disenchanted by Glinda, and in her woman's form was given\r\nbrains and a round head. This wife of the Su-dic had once been even\r\nmore wicked than her evil husband, but she had now forgotten all her\r\nwickedness and was likely to be a good woman thereafter.\r\n\r\nThese things being accomplished in a satisfactory manner, Princess\r\nOzma and her people bade farewell to the three Adepts and departed for\r\nthe Emerald City, well pleased with their interesting adventures.\r\n\r\nThey returned by the road over which Ozma and Dorothy had come,\r\nstopping to get the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon where they had left\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"I'm very glad I went to see these peoples,\" said Princess Ozma, \"for\r\nI not only prevented any further warfare between them, but they have\r\nbeen freed from the rule of the Su-dic and Coo-ee-oh and are now happy\r\nand loyal subjects of the Land of Oz. Which proves that it is always\r\nwise to do one's duty, however unpleasant that duty may seem to be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note\r\n\r\n\r\nArchaic and inconsistent spelling, punctuation, and syntax retained.",
