By Gabriel Monod          697\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF CHINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late reconquest by China of some of her former possessions in\r\nCentral Asia, and the firm tone in which she is urging her demands upon\r\nRussia, in respect of the _Kuldja_ territory, are giving her a\r\nprominence as a factor in Asiatic politics which she can scarcely be\r\nsaid to have claimed before. These signs of tenacity of purpose, if not\r\nof actual vitality, acquire an additional interest when viewed in\r\nconnection with the recently modified policy of her Government towards\r\nWestern States; a policy which, whether induced by an honest intention\r\nto forego the traditional exclusiveness of past ages, or by a shrewd\r\ndetermination to cope, if possible, with more advanced nations upon the\r\nadvantageous footing secured by the cultivation of the progressive Arts\r\nand Sciences, has had the effect of bringing China into diplomatic\r\nrelations with the principal Powers of Europe and America, and\r\nintroducing her as a recognised element into the political calculations\r\nof the civilized world. The issue of the _Kuldja_ controversy has a\r\nspecial interest for England, as the mistress of adjacent territory in\r\nIndia; but a far greater importance attaches to the result of the larger\r\nefforts which China is making to take up a position amongst the nations,\r\nand upon the success of which all her political future must depend. It\r\nis of that future, and of its bearing upon the interests of China's two\r\ngreat rivals in Asiatic dominion, Russia and Great Britain, that this\r\npaper proposes to treat.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be predicated of the Government of China, at any rate at\r\npresent, that it is greedy of territory. On the contrary, its\r\nresponsibilities are already as serious as it must feel at all competent\r\nto fulfil with credit to itself and satisfaction to its people. But, on\r\nthe other hand, it is remarkably tenacious of parting with a single rood\r\nof ground, to which it may claim the right of traditional possession or\r\nmore recent conquest. When portions of its territory have been torn\r\nfrom its grasp by successful rebellion, it has for the moment yielded to\r\nthe inevitable. But the earliest opportunity possible has been seized\r\nfor reentering upon possession, either by force or craft. The late\r\nrecovery of the province of Yunnan in China proper, and of Chinese\r\nTurkestan in Central Asia, after crushing defeats and years of\r\nalienation, affords notable instances of this tenacity of purpose. But\r\nsuch successful reentries upon lost dominion have only been effected\r\nwhere the usurping power has partaken of the same or a similar Asiatic\r\ncharacter with that of the Chinese themselves. Where circumstances have\r\nbrought the Government into collision with the more energetic and\r\nenterprising people of the West, it has had no alternative but to make\r\nmaterial concessions, and to confirm these by treaties of perpetual\r\namity and commerce. Russia and England are the only Western Powers that\r\nhave thus benefited themselves at the expense of China: Russia, with a\r\nview to the enlargement or rectification of her frontier, which from the\r\nmouth of the Amour to the foot of the _Tien Shan_ is conterminous with\r\nthat of China; and England, for the protection and promotion of her\r\ntrade, which must have languished, if not perished, under the\r\nconstraints of the old _Co-hong_ system.\r\n\r\nWhether the resubjugation of entire provinces by the Imperial Government\r\nmay be regarded as a blessing or a curse to the populations concerned,\r\nit is difficult to decide. For them it is unhappily a mere choice\r\nbetween being at the mercy of unscrupulous adventurers, elated with a\r\nseries of successes, and rendered ferocious by a life of rapine, but\r\nutterly unprepared to introduce any serious system of reform; or being\r\nrestored to a rule which, although worn out and feeble, has the\r\nadvantage of an old-established organization, and can prove, by its\r\ngeneral policy at any rate, that it has the welfare of the governed\r\nseriously at heart. On the whole, setting aside the wholesale cruelty\r\nwhich has unhappily too often distinguished such governmental triumphs\r\non the part of the Chinese, and to which, indeed, the unlucky people\r\nseem liable whichever party may happen to gain the ascendency, the\r\npreferable conclusion would seem to be that resubmission to native\r\nauthority is perhaps the mildest fate that can be desired for those\r\nsubjects of China whose country has unfortunately been the scene of\r\ncivil war. But an entirely different result may be looked for when\r\nforeign dominion--that is to say, European--has taken the place of\r\nChinese. In the case of England, there can be little fear but that, in\r\nspite of the notable mistakes which have at times marked her colonial\r\nadministration of Asiatic peoples, the primary object to which she has\r\nalways set herself has been the welfare of the governed, and the\r\ndevelopment of the resources of the country which they occupy. And even\r\nas regards Russia, however irresponsible her system of government,\r\nselfish and unscrupulous her foreign policy, and corrupt her executive,\r\nmay be regarded from an English point of view, still there can be\r\nlittle question that her assumption of authority over any tract of Asian\r\nterritory must be considered preferable in the interests of philanthropy\r\nand general expediency to its restoration to an intrinsically weak and\r\nunpractical Government like that of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the above proposition is a reasonable one, it follows as a\r\nfair inference, that the sooner China or any part of it is brought under\r\nthe sway of some strong and progressive Power the better. And really,\r\nlooking at the matter from a purely philanthropic and utilitarian point\r\nof view, that is about the best fate that can befall its inhabitants, as\r\nwell in their own interest as in that of the world at large. Many things\r\nconspire to show that the days of the ruling dynasty are numbered; and\r\nwho can say, when the catastrophe does come, whether the huge but\r\ncrumbling fabric will ever be reconstructed? or, if so, whose will be\r\nthe head and hand that will accomplish the task? The probability is that\r\nthe empire will, in spite of the marvellous homogeneity which\r\ncharacterizes its people, at once lose its cohesion, and break up into a\r\nnumber of petty chiefdoms; and one may well imagine the grievous and\r\nprotracted misery that must follow upon such a dissolution. It would be\r\nridiculous, nay wicked, to suggest that this contingency might be\r\nanticipated, and an endeavour made to avert it by the timely absorption\r\nof a portion or of the whole of the Chinese territory. But we are\r\nentitled to express the hope that the course of mundane affairs may so\r\nshape itself as that such a calamity may be indefinitely delayed; or, if\r\nit be inevitable, that it may fall to the lot of some nation to take up\r\nthe reins which shall have the will as well as the power to use the\r\nopportunity to the best advantage of the millions concerned.\r\n\r\nThe speculation seems here to suggest itself, whether there is a Western\r\nPower at all likely to find itself placed in this position, or which may\r\nbe considered a suitable instrument for carrying out the work of\r\nreconstruction. The sphere of selection is limited. England and Russia,\r\nas far as can at present be foreseen, appear to be the only two Powers\r\nwhose mission or interest seems likely to impel their influence\r\nEastwards. Any idea that England will ever deliberately enter upon the\r\npossession of even a part of Chinese territory may at once be dismissed\r\nas unworthy to be entertained. Although her vast trade and world-wide\r\nassociations are perpetually landing her in perplexing complications\r\nwith Eastern tribes, complications, too, which at times, in despite of\r\nherself, end in conquest or annexation, still her modern policy is\r\nanything but aggressive; and if there be one collision which the English\r\npeople would be less inclined to tolerate than another, it would be that\r\nof a little war entered upon for the mere purpose of territorial\r\nacquisition or philanthropic reform. China, moreover, is no mere petty\r\nprincipality like Abyssinia, Ashantee, or Afghanistan, that she had need\r\nbe liable to the risk of annihilation or annexation, even should she\r\nagain unhappily venture to take up arms against England on account of a\r\nmere trade dispute. But with Russia the case is materially different.\r\nAn acquisitive policy has been traditional with her ever since Peter the\r\nGreat, with prophetic foresight, laid down the lines by which her future\r\nconduct was to be guided; and political interest has none the less urged\r\nher on to extend her possessions Asia-wards, and to secure as much\r\nseaboard in any direction as will suit her ambitious designs. Conquests\r\nin Asia, moreover, provide a convenient safety-valve for adventurous,\r\ndiscontented, or unscrupulous spirits, who might occasion mischief at\r\nhome, and who cannot otherwise be readily disposed of; whilst they at\r\nthe same time have the effect of furnishing that outlet for a through\r\ntrade which has always been the Russian merchant's dream. Russia has\r\nalready, as is well known, rectified her frontier on the north and west\r\nof China, seriously to the diminution of the area not so long ago\r\ncomprised by the latter, and, by a well-directed combination of courage\r\nand craft, she has within the last twenty years succeeded in conquering\r\nor annexing extensive and fertile tracts of country in Central Asia.\r\nWhat more likely, therefore, than that, octopus-like, she should\r\ncontinue to stretch out her huge tentacles further and further, until\r\nthey embrace some of the broad and fair provinces of China within their\r\nomnivorous grasp? The advantage of such an acquisition to Russia cannot\r\nbe over-estimated. The Russian press, it is true, deprecates the\r\nacquisition of new territory, as being calculated to hinder the\r\neconomical development of the people, and seriously to increase the\r\npresent difficulties of the empire; and there can be little doubt that\r\nthe dominions of the Czar are far too disproportioned to the numerical\r\nsum of his subjects to admit of their having realized, as they might\r\nhave done, the immense natural riches of the empire. But with the\r\nacquisition of almost any part of China proper, Russia would gain\r\nterritory already thickly peopled to her hand, and possessed of rich\r\nresources of every kind; and, could she approach the sea in any\r\ndirection, she would acquire--what is so important to her maritime and\r\ncommercial development--a coast-line that would go far towards giving\r\nher the commanding position as a naval Power which has always been one\r\nof her most cherished ambitions.\r\n\r\nAnd what a glorious field would thereby be afforded her for developing\r\nher political designs! Instead of beating her wings to her own\r\ndiscomfiture against the bars which England must always throw about her\r\nas long as she persists in her attempts to absorb Turkey, or exercise a\r\ncovert influence over the tribes on our Indian frontier, she would, if\r\nshe pressed China-wards in preference, find unlimited opportunities for\r\nincreasing her resources, enlarging her territory, and extending her\r\nsway, no nation caring, or being called upon, to say her nay. That she\r\nwould prove the most suitable Power to be entrusted with so tremendous a\r\nresponsibility, is an assertion that few would care to hazard without\r\nlarge qualification. The pitiless despotism which characterizes the\r\nRussian rule at home, the unrelenting harshness with which she has\r\ntreated her Polish subjects, even to the studious stamping out of the\r\nnationalism of the people, and the license which has distinguished the\r\ngrasp by Russian officials of civil power in Central Asia, scarcely tend\r\nto render the prospect of the extension of her sway to China very\r\nencouraging. But, as has been already advanced, a Russian administration\r\nis not without its advantages, as compared to a Chinese, and, unless a\r\nradical reform can be looked for in the existing system of government in\r\nChina itself, a prospect at best problematical, it may safely be said\r\nthat her people might fare worse than pass under the domination of the\r\nCzar.\r\n\r\nFor the Chinese concerned, as has been suggested, the loss might be\r\nalmost, if not altogether, construed into a gain. They would acquire an\r\nautocratic and despotic Government very similar to their own, only more\r\npowerful and practical in its operation and results; and, if only one\r\ncould hope that the rights and prejudices of the people could be\r\nrespected, and their general interests consulted, the change would on\r\nthe whole prove an advantageous one for the annexed territories\r\ngenerally. In one respect, at any rate, such a substitution might\r\ncertainly be expected to bring about a material amelioration of the\r\npresent condition and prospects of the country at large; and that is the\r\nimprovement of general communication throughout the empire. Railways\r\nwould undoubtedly be forthwith introduced, telegraphs laid down, river\r\nchannels cleared and deepened, canals restored and maintained, and the\r\nmany obstacles which now clog a might-be flourishing trade permanently\r\nremoved. China, in fact, only needs a lion-hearted, capable, and\r\nprogressive Government in order to encourage the enterprise of her\r\npeople, bring out their many excellent characteristics, and develop the\r\nprolific natural resources which she undoubtedly possesses, in her own\r\ninterest and that of the world in general; and, provided always such a\r\nresult can be attained, combined with a discreet and paternal care for\r\nthe people themselves, no one had need deprecate the substitution of a\r\nforeign for a native yoke.\r\n\r\nIt might be objected, Why should not such a thorough reconstruction and\r\nsubsequent healthy development be attainable under the present dynasty,\r\nor, at any rate, under a purely native rule? To this we reply that it is\r\nnot in the nature of the Chinese to initiate reform or carry it honestly\r\nand steadily out. Neither the rulers nor the ruled appreciate its\r\nnecessity; and, could they be enlightened sufficiently to perceive it,\r\nthey do not possess the strength of character and fixity of purpose to\r\nfollow out implicitly the course pointed out. A curious example of this\r\nlack of interest and resolve was to be observed as regards the\r\nforeign-drilled levies raised at the instance of their foreign advisers\r\nafter the treaty of Tientsin. Men and money were readily provided to the\r\nextent suggested, and the men easily learnt the drill. But the foreign\r\ninstructors had always to superintend the paying of wages in order to\r\nprevent peculation by the native officers, and, the moment their\r\nvigilant eyes were removed, drill and discipline were voted a nuisance\r\nby officers and men alike, arms and accoutrements ceased to be kept in\r\norder, and the force rapidly assumed its purely Chinese character.\r\nRelics of these levies exist at this moment, but the most unremitting\r\npatience and effort have been needed on the part of the foreign officers\r\nto maintain them in a state of anything like respectable discipline or\r\neffectiveness. A recent writer[1] calls attention to the stupendous\r\nefforts which the Chinese Government has of late been making towards a\r\nreorganization of its naval and military resources upon Western\r\nprinciples, and to the remarkable success which has in consequence\r\nattended its campaigns in Western China and Central Asia. But these\r\nmeasures have all owed their conception and execution to foreign energy,\r\nenterprise, and ability; and, as will be presently shown, wherever the\r\nsalutary influence of these is weakened or removed, disorganization and\r\nrelapse are sure to be the result. Something has, no doubt, been\r\naccomplished within the last twenty years towards opening the eyes of\r\nthe Chinese Government to the wisdom of assuming a recognised place in\r\nthe comity of nations, and inducing it to introduce various domestic\r\nmeasures of a useful and progressive nature. But, after all, pressure\r\nfrom without, and that of the most painstaking and persistent character,\r\nhas been needed to effect what little has been done. Let this influence\r\nbe removed; let the able customs organization now in vogue be taken out\r\nof alien hands; let foreign Ministers cease to impress upon the State\r\ndepartments the imperative importance of waking up to international and\r\ndomestic responsibilities; let arsenals be deprived of foreign\r\nsuperintendence; let steamers throw overboard their foreign masters,\r\nmates, and engineers; in a word, let China try to keep afloat without\r\ncorks, and what will be the consequence? Corruption would inevitably\r\nfatten on and extinguish foreign trade; foreign representatives would\r\nfind Pekin too hot to hold them; arsenals would gradually languish and\r\ncease to work; native-owned steamers would leave off plying the waters;\r\nand the whole country would eventually fall back into a condition of\r\neven more rapid decadence than that in which it was found when England\r\nfirst interfered to prop it up. What is perhaps more melancholy to\r\ncontemplate, there would be few, if any, of her most ardent patriots but\r\nwould congratulate themselves on the miserable change.\r\n\r\nChina may, perhaps, be saved from an eventual collapse, or from falling\r\nunder the sway of all-grasping Russia; but it can only be by a universal\r\ndevelopment of the existing system of extraneous aid. What has been done\r\nfor her customs revenue must be extended to all departments of the\r\nState, and the employment of foreign heads and hands must be rendered so\r\ngeneral as even to permeate the ramifications of the executive in the\r\neighteen provinces. But then the difficulty suggests itself. Where is\r\nthe _personnel_ needful for such a mighty organization to be found, with\r\nthe talent and probity equal to the charge? England has proved it\r\npossible, in the case of India, to produce a corps of administrators who\r\npossess a character for ability, uprightness, and high-minded devotion\r\nto duty, to which the world can show no equal. But, as experience has so\r\nfar proved, political balance at Pekin demands that the prizes open to\r\ncompetition in the Chinese service should be distributed equally amongst\r\nsubjects of all nationalities in treaty relations with China; and in\r\nsuch a huge army of _employés_ as the exigency would require, and most\r\nof whom would probably owe their selection to patronage rather than to\r\nmerit, it could not be but that many would find a place who might prove\r\neven greater curses to the governed than the worst type of the Chinese\r\nmandarins themselves. Moreover, such an innovation would practically\r\namount to placing the entire nation under foreign authority, and it may\r\nbe queried whether it would not be more advantageous for the people to\r\nhave one uniform foreign rule universally substituted for the native,\r\nthan to be at the mercy of an executive formed of such heterogeneous\r\nmaterials as those we have described.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place to consider here a suggestion, which has been\r\nthrown out by more than one representative of the English press, as to\r\nthe identity of British interests with those of China in resisting the\r\ninsidious advances of Russia eastwards, and the expediency of giving the\r\nformer our sympathy, if not material support, in her endeavour to\r\nrecover _Kuldja_ from Russian cupidity. What British interests comprise\r\nin that quarter of the globe may be summed up in a few words.\r\nRectification and consolidation of certain portions of the frontier of\r\nBritish India, the maintenance as far as possible of neutral and\r\nindependent Khanates to act as \"buffers\" between her territories and\r\nthose of Russia, and the development of a free and active trade between\r\nthe Indian and Central Asian markets. It seems scarcely worth the\r\ntrouble of refuting any arguments that could be brought forward to prove\r\nthat the concession of a covert or direct support to China in the\r\n_Kuldja_ controversy would be likely to advantage England in any one of\r\nthese respects. On the contrary, her interference would more probably\r\nimperil her interests under each head, and would most certainly have the\r\neffect of greatly incensing a Power which, with all its ill-will, has\r\nalready shown its desire to conciliate, by withdrawing at our request\r\nthe influence which it had been tempted in view of certain contingencies\r\nto use to our disadvantage in Afghanistan; a Power, too, which must and\r\nwill pursue its career of acquisition in Central Asia, whatever we may\r\nsay or do to the contrary; and with which, in view of its probable\r\nfuture there, it is manifestly to our interest as holders of India to\r\nlive on neighbourly terms. To quote a recent writer on the subject,[2]\r\n\"Our object now should be rather to initiate a frank understanding with\r\nRussia as to the aims of our respective policies, to secure her\r\nagreement to definite boundaries to the spheres of influence of both\r\nPowers, and to form, so far as is possible, a union of interests with\r\nher in the future development of Asia.\"\r\n\r\nEven were China to pledge herself to grant us all the advantages which\r\nwe should have to bargain for as a consideration for committing\r\nourselves to the serious step of affording her aid, it may be doubted\r\nwhether she is sufficiently strong to maintain her ground, not merely\r\nagainst Russia, but against any adventurer like Yakoob Beg or rebels\r\nlike the Panthays, who may suddenly rise up and wrest her territory from\r\nher. Then, again, it must be remembered what an alliance with such a\r\nGovernment as that of China is likely to involve. Her civil\r\nadministration, based although it may be on a system excellently well\r\nsuited to a people like the Chinese, is so weakened, save in a few\r\nisolated instances, by the incapacity, and so debased by the venality of\r\nits executive, that it has long since forfeited the confidence and\r\ngood-will of the masses, and rebellion has only to raise its head to\r\nfind a fruitful soil for its speedy growth and development. Her army is\r\nnumerically large, and can be recruited without difficulty, and she has\r\nconstantly at command any quantity of the most approved war material, so\r\nlong as there are foreigners to sell and she has the money to buy; to\r\nsay nothing of what she can now to a certain extent manufacture for\r\nherself. But of strategy and the general science of war her officers are\r\nentirely ignorant, and beyond the capability of hurling huge masses of\r\nmen at the enemy, irrespective of all consequences, she is in no way\r\nformidable as a military Power in the European sense of the term, nor\r\ncould her troops permanently hope to hold their own against those of any\r\nWestern State. Even the Japanese, in the little affair with China which\r\nthreatened the peaceful relations of the two countries not long ago,\r\nshowed themselves quite equal to the occasion, and their sailors and\r\nsoldiers pined to exhibit their prowess, and prove the value of their\r\nrecent acquirements in the art of war, as against the conservative and\r\nunpractical Chinese. If the rules of civilized warfare are to the\r\nChinese a sealed book, still less can they be said to appreciate its\r\nhumane side. Their officers fail to value the necessity, and indeed do\r\nnot seem to possess the power, of protecting their own countrymen from\r\nthe general license which marks the march of soldiery through, or the\r\nmilitary occupation of, any peaceable district; and in the wholesale\r\nbarbarities which invariably distinguish their triumphs over a conquered\r\nfoe, they are scarcely to be surpassed by savages of the lowest type.\r\nLittle more can be said in favour of the Chinese in respect of their\r\nrelations with England and other Western nations. They have treaties of\r\npeace and commerce with the leading Powers, it is true, and they do not\r\nfail to act up to the strict letter of these engagements as construed by\r\nthemselves. But the whole history of their foreign intercourse since\r\n1842 has shown that the Chinese Government has borne with ill grace the\r\nrestrictions thus imposed upon it, and has embraced every opportunity to\r\nevade them in spirit, whilst professing to carry them out in the\r\nletter. Trade has been everywhere hampered by vexatious imposts\r\ncunningly introduced on all kinds of pretexts, and as pertinaciously\r\npersisted in, in spite of pointed remonstrances on the part of foreign\r\nrepresentatives. Outrages of a glaring kind have been passed over\r\nwithout redress, or perhaps with a show of redress so ingeniously\r\nconceded as to evince distinct sympathy with the perpetrators of the\r\ndeeds complained of; and the case must be rare, if not unheard of, in\r\nwhich the initiative has been voluntarily taken by a Chinese official in\r\nrighting a wrong suffered by a foreigner at the hands of a Chinese.\r\nAmicable relations prevail between the various foreign communities and\r\nthe native population by whom they are surrounded; but these may be\r\ntraced rather to the innate good-nature of the people, and the\r\nforbearing conduct of the \"strangers from afar,\" than to any direct\r\neffort on the part of the native authorities to encourage and develop\r\nfriendly feeling. The Chinese Court still affects to regard the Emperor\r\nas the Supreme Ruler of all People under Heaven; its recognition of\r\nforeign Ministers accredited to it seems never to have advanced beyond\r\nthe not very flattering ceremonial which accorded them a so-called\r\naudience in a body a few years ago; and the relations between the\r\nrepresentatives and the high officials at Pekin cannot as yet be said to\r\nhave entered upon a phase which may strictly be styled cordial; and all\r\nthis, notwithstanding that Chinese representatives to Western Courts\r\nhave been treated with all the ceremony and consideration due to their\r\nofficial position, and have been received into the highest society of\r\nforeign capitals, not only without demur, but with a warmth and\r\nhospitality which, whilst on the spot, they have themselves been the\r\nfirst to acknowledge.[3] Under these circumstances, with a civil\r\nadministration so effete and corrupt, a military Power so unpractical,\r\na style of warfare so barbarous, and a Government so wanting in the\r\nhonest desire to conciliate, can it be thought politic to go out of our\r\nway in order to further its pretensions, and that to the prejudice of a\r\nPower which, with all its faults, is progressive in its tendencies, and\r\nprepared to acknowledge our international rights, and which more nearly\r\napproaches us in recognising the duty of consulting the material\r\ninterests of the people subjected to its sway? The little experience at\r\nany rate which we have had of the results of co-operation with the\r\nChinese Government has not been such as to encourage us in a repetition\r\nof the experiment. Take, for example, the important aid given by England\r\nin clearing the province of Kiangsu of rebels in 1862-63, and thereby\r\nbringing about the eventual extermination of the Taepings. Such a\r\nservice, it might be presumed, would have earned the lasting gratitude\r\nof the nation, and induced a cordiality of sentiment towards their\r\nbenefactors which would have exhibited itself in an endeavour on the\r\npart of the Chinese Government to relax the restrictions and remove the\r\nvexations by which mutual relations had up to that time been beset. But\r\nnothing of the kind transpired. No special and national recognition of\r\nthe service rendered was ever accorded; and, so far from any improvement\r\nbeing observable, as a consequence, in British relations with China,\r\nthese were marked in the sequel by some of the most trying and difficult\r\ncrises with which we have had to deal. More than this, the very moment\r\nof triumph was disgraced by an act of treachery in the deliberate murder\r\nof the surrendered rebel chiefs at Soochow, which must have induced in\r\nthe mind of Colonel Gordon, R.E., the keenest regret that he had ever\r\nembarked his honour and expended his labours in the cause of such\r\nallies. The only other instance in which British influence was brought\r\nto bear towards rescuing the Chinese Government from an awkward dilemma\r\nwas when the Japanese threatened reprisals for outrages committed\r\nagainst their subjects, and went the length of sending a considerable\r\nforce to occupy the island of Formosa. Hostilities had commenced, and\r\nthe war might have proved a protracted if not hazardous one for the\r\nChinese, had not H.B.M.'s Minister volunteered his services as mediator,\r\nand succeeded in arranging matters to the satisfaction of both parties,\r\nand with as little loss of prestige to the Chinese as they had any\r\nright to expect. Here, again, if any gratitude was felt, there was no\r\npublic recognition of the service rendered, and the obligation certainly\r\nleft no appreciable trace upon the subsequent policy of the Government;\r\nfor, in the very next difficulty with China which occurred not long\r\nafter--namely, the official murder of Margary--it needed the pressure of\r\nour demands to the very verge of war, in order to procure the vaguest\r\nattempt at redress, and then we had to rest contented with commercial\r\nconcessions as a makeweight for the substantial justice which could not,\r\nor would not, be granted.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, China, nationally considered, is in a state of decline. The\r\nvery efforts which the more enlightened amongst her statesmen are now\r\nmaking towards rescuing her from the collapse which threatens show how\r\ndesperate they consider her case, and how anxious they are to prevent or\r\neven delay the catastrophe. Her history, it is true, shows that although\r\nshe has passed through a series of such periodical lapses, she has ever\r\nexhibited a wonderful power of recuperation more or less effective in\r\nits nature and extent. But these changes have been experienced at times\r\nwhen she was comparatively isolated from the rest of the world. Her\r\npolitical crises were never before complicated by the interposition of a\r\nforeign element, such as must be the case in any revolution through\r\nwhich she may hereafter pass. Mr. Robert Hart, the Inspector-General of\r\nCustoms, Joseph-like, has done China good service in reorganizing the\r\nmaritime revenue department, and advocating reform generally in the\r\npolicy and practice of the State; and did China know her own interest\r\nshe would largely develop and extend the advantages of a foreign\r\nadmixture in her whole system of executive. But Mr. Hart's efforts must\r\nhave a limited result at best, and they can only serve to put off the\r\nevil day. He cannot reform the nature of the Chinese mandarin; and until\r\nthere is a radical change in this respect there can be little hope of\r\nreconstruction and progress under purely native guidance. The process\r\nbecomes the more embarrassing and futile with aggressive foreign Powers\r\npressing on all sides with their irresistible influence and exacting\r\npretensions. China must in time, and as at present constituted, yield to\r\none or the other, and Russia promises to be the one whose ambition and\r\ninterests will probably lead her to turn the opportunity to advantage.\r\nIt may not be the best fate that can befall any part of China to be\r\nRussianized, but it will be a better alternative for her people to be\r\nsubjected to the sway of a civilized and civilizing Power than to become\r\nthe prey to interminable civil wars. It will be better, moreover, for\r\nEngland and other nations, whose interest in the question is mainly\r\ncommercial, that China's millions should be brought under a vigorous and\r\nprogressive Government, able and willing to develop the vast trade\r\nresources at their disposal, than that they should decimate themselves\r\nand ruin their country by perpetual internecine strife. Whether it will\r\nbe to the interest of England in a political point of view that Russia\r\nshould attain the commanding position which the possession of any part\r\nof China would undoubtedly secure her, is an entirely different\r\nquestion. If it be a danger, it is a danger which she must look in the\r\nface, for everything seems to point to the possibility of such a\r\nconsummation. But no consideration of political expediency or\r\nself-preservation can certainly warrant her in interfering as yet; and\r\nit is to be hoped that the time may never come when she shall be called\r\nupon to thwart the ambitious designs of her great rival in Asian\r\ndominion in the extreme East, as she has so long and so successfully\r\nendeavoured to do in countries more directly affecting her political\r\npower and prestige in Europe and India.\r\n\r\n  WALTER H. MEDHURST.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Captain C. A. G. Bridge, R.N.: \"The Revival of the Warlike Power of\r\nChina,\" _Fraser's Magazine_, June, 1879.\r\n\r\n[2] See _Blackwood's Magazine_, July, 1879, pp. 120, 121.\r\n\r\n[3] Apropos of these remarks it is worth while quoting here a memorial\r\nby the ex-Ambassador Kwo Sung-t'ao, published in the _London and China\r\nTelegraph_ of 7th July, 1879, as the first presented to the Throne on\r\nhis return to China, and in which the best that he can say of England,\r\nnotwithstanding his cordial reception and marvellous experiences, seems\r\nto be that he was \"excessively cast down in a strange country,\" where,\r\n\"had he been put into a ditch, there would have been nobody to cover him\r\nwith earth.\" The very name of the place to which he was accredited\r\nappears to have been beneath mention to his august master. The _Peking\r\nGazette_ of the 3rd moon, 3rd day, contains the following memorial from\r\nKwo Sung-t'ao, late Ambassador at the Court of St. James's, to the\r\nEmperor:--\"Your servant,\" he writes, \"has suffered from many bodily\r\ninfirmities. Relying upon the heavenly (_i.e._, your Majesty's) grace, I\r\nwas appointed to go abroad on service of heavy responsibility. I am now\r\nfeeble with age, having served at so great a distance; I also deplore my\r\nstupidity, and am extremely apprehensive of my inability in performing\r\nthe functions devolving upon me. Since the sixth or seventh moon of the\r\nyear before last I have suffered from insomnia. A year ago my spirits\r\nbecame daily more _abattu_. In the second month of last year I suddenly\r\nexperienced phlegm rising in my mouth, and vomited fresh red blood,\r\nwithout being able to stop it, so that in a trice a basin would get\r\nquite full. I consider that my life has been marked by increasing\r\nafflictions; my respiration is impeded; I am agitated and nervous;\r\nalready I have contracted an asthma, and this I certainly had not\r\nformerly. Excessively cast down, in a strange country several tens of\r\nthousands of li away, I thought that if I were put in a ditch there\r\nwould be nobody to cover me with earth. Fortunately, by virtue of the\r\nheavenly (_i.e._, Imperial) compassion, having been graciously permitted\r\nto give up my office, all that remains of me, protractedly wearing out\r\nmy failing breath, is due to the overflowing grace of the Holy Lord (the\r\nEmperor). During the two years I have been abroad I have passed under\r\nthe hands of foreign doctors not a few, who felt my pulse and\r\nadministered medicine in a manner very different from native\r\npractitioners. In relieving my indigestion and removing the torpor [of\r\nmy liver] they occasionally produced some little effect; but my\r\nconstitution became weaker every day, and there was no restoring it.\r\nAfter casting about this way and that, there seemed but one resource\r\nleft to me--to take advantage of a steamer bound for Fu (_i.e._,\r\nShanghai), and then to return by way of the Yangtsze River to my native\r\nplace and put myself under medical advice. Prostrate I implore the\r\nHeavenly Compassion to grant me three months' leave of absence, in order\r\nto establish a complete cure, so that perhaps I may not contract disease\r\nthat will prove incurable. After your servant has got home it will be\r\nhis duty to report early the day of his arrival, and he earnestly\r\ndesires that he may be restored to health. Then I will return to the\r\ncapital to resume my functions, and implore that some trifling post may\r\nbe given me that I may testify my gratitude by strenuous exertions, like\r\na dog or a horse. Wherefore I, your humble servant, now beg for leave of\r\nabsence on account of my ill-health, and respectfully present the\r\npetition in which my request is lucidly set forth, entreating with\r\nreverence that the sacred glance may rest upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMALS AND PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first of the present series of Essays it was pointed out[4] that\r\nthe number of kinds of living creatures is so prodigious that it would\r\nbe a hopeless task for any man to attempt to grasp the leading facts of\r\ntheir natural history, save with the help of a well-arranged system of\r\nclassification. Such a system enables the student to consider the\r\nsubjects of his study collectively in masses--masses arranged in a\r\nseries of groups, which are successively smaller and more and more\r\nsubordinate. By \"subordinate groups\" are meant groups which are\r\nsuccessively contained one within the other. As an example of such\r\nsubordinate grouping we may take the group of familiar objects denoted\r\nby the word \"money.\" This group contains within it the large subordinate\r\ngroups, \"paper money\" and \"metallic money;\" the latter group again\r\ncontains the more subordinate and smaller groups, \"gold money,\" \"silver\r\nmoney,\" and \"copper money,\" and these respectively contain still more\r\nsubordinate and smaller groups. Thus, the group \"silver money\" contains\r\nthe subordinate groups--(1) crowns, (2) half-crowns, (3) florins, (4)\r\nshillings, (5) sixpences, &c.; and any one of these (_e.g._, shillings)\r\nis further divisible into groups of \"shillings\" of the coinage of\r\ndifferent reigns.\r\n\r\nReversing the process we may, as another illustration, select the group\r\nof articles of furniture called \"chairs,\" which (with other\r\n_co-ordinate_ groups, such as \"tables\" and \"sofas\") is contained within,\r\nand is subordinate to, the larger group of objects, \"wooden furniture.\"\r\nThis latter and larger group is again classifiable (together with its\r\nco-ordinate group, \"metal furniture\") in the yet higher and larger group\r\nof \"furniture made of hard material,\" to which the wooden and metal\r\ngroups are both subordinate. Co-ordinate with the group of \"hard\r\nmaterial\" we have another group (carpets, curtains, &c.) of \"furniture\r\nof soft material,\" and these two groups are again subordinate to the\r\nlargest group of all \"furniture.\"\r\n\r\nIt was also pointed out in the introductory Essay[5] that there are two\r\nkinds of classification, one artificial, the other natural--the latter\r\n(the kind aimed at in this Essay) being such a system of classification\r\nas leads to the association together in groups, of creatures which are\r\n_really_ alike and which will be found to present a greater and greater\r\nnumber of common characters the more thoroughly they are examined.\r\n\r\nThe system of classification which zoologists and botanists adopt is a\r\nsystem founded upon the form, structure, number, and relations of the\r\nparts of which each living being consists. It is, therefore, a\r\nmorphological system, and rests rather upon the appearances of parts and\r\norgans than upon the offices which such parts and organs fulfil. It\r\nrests, that is to say upon their forms, not upon their functions.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which animals have been arranged in zoological grouping\r\naffords an exceptionally good model for classification generally, as has\r\nbeen noted by the late John Stuart Mill.[6] In fact, the number of\r\nsubordinate groups is very great in zoology. Thus, the kingdom of\r\nanimals is subdivided into a certain number of very large groups, called\r\n_sub-kingdoms_. Each sub-kingdom is again divided into subordinate\r\ngroups termed _classes_. Each class is again divided into still more\r\nsubordinate groups called _orders_. Each order is again divisible into\r\n_families_; each family into _genera_, and each genus into _species_,\r\nwhile a zoological \"species\" may be provisionally defined as \"a group of\r\nanimals which differ only by inconstant or sexual characters.\"\r\n\r\nIt could be wished that the reader should pursue his further inquiries\r\ninto the natural history of animals and plants, with a knowledge of\r\nbiological classification already acquired. But this is, unfortunately,\r\nimpossible, since biological classification reposes upon anatomical\r\nfacts, and cannot, therefore, be really understood until the main facts\r\nof anatomy have been already mastered. Yet something in the way of a\r\nclassification, or at least of a definitely arranged catalogue, must be\r\neven now attempted for the following reason:--\r\n\r\nIn the second of this series of Essays[7] we indicated the lines of\r\ninquiry which must be followed up by any reader who would become\r\nacquainted with the natural history of animals and plants. We saw that\r\ntheir gross and minute structure, their very varied functions, their\r\nrelations to past time, and their geographical relations as well as\r\ntheir relations to the physical forces and to their fellow organisms,\r\nwould all have to be successively considered. Obviously, however, it is\r\nimpossible to make known the facts of anatomy, physiology, and\r\nhexicology[8] without constant references to animals and plants which\r\nmay be expected to be either altogether unknown, or at least very\r\nincompletely known, to persons as yet unacquainted with zoological and\r\nbotanical science.\r\n\r\nReferences to creatures so unknown or so little known would plainly be\r\nof small profit and less interest, unless the reader was already\r\nfurnished with some mental images of such creatures and groups of\r\ncreatures--images calculated to sustain his attention and excite his\r\ninterest in the various kinds of animals and plants, otherwise unknown,\r\nwhich will have to be again and again referred to. Accordingly, an\r\nattempt must now be made to set before the reader a rough and general\r\nsketch, or catalogue, of what the creatures and groups of creatures are,\r\nthe names of which will have so frequently to appear in the pages which\r\nare to follow. In a word, as the preceding Essay[9] was devoted to\r\nexplaining what are the special characters of living beings--_i.e._,\r\nwhat the phrase \"animals and plants\" _connotes_; so the present Essay is\r\nintended to explain what that phrase _denotes_. It is not by any means\r\nintended at present to place before the reader a definitive and complete\r\nsystem of classification--that task must be reserved for the conclusion\r\nof the series, as it will be the expression of all the facts and\r\ninferences which will have been in the meantime brought forward.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose now in view it will be well, perhaps, to follow the\r\nsuggestion of the great naturalist, Buffon, and begin with creatures\r\nwhich are amongst the best known and most familiar, and thence proceed\r\nto speak of less and less familiar forms.\r\n\r\nIn this Essay assertions will be freely made as to the natural\r\naffinities which the author believes to exist between the creatures to\r\nbe enumerated, but no attempt will be made to give the reasons for such\r\nassertions. The justification of such affirmations will, it is believed,\r\nbecome apparent later, when the organization of living beings shall have\r\nbeen portrayed as far as the space and the ability at the command of the\r\nwriter may enable him to portray them.\r\n\r\nAs before said the object now in view is to endeavour to present a\r\ngeneral view of living beings--of animals and plants--in the hope of\r\nfixing in the reader's memory the names of species, and of groups of\r\nspecies, to which names reference will have to be more or less\r\nfrequently hereinafter made. At the least, such a catalogue may serve\r\nfor reference whenever the reader may come upon the names of animals or\r\nplants, or of groups of animals or plants, the meanings of which names\r\nmay have escaped his recollection.\r\n\r\nThe animals most familiar to us, our domestic cattle and our dogs and\r\ncats, all belong to a group of animals technically termed _mammals_,\r\nfrom the circumstance that the females have milk-glands (or _mammæ_), by\r\nwhich they nourish their young. The name \"beasts\" may be set apart for\r\nthe brute animals belonging to this group; but they do not altogether\r\nform it, since man himself--the most individually numerous of all the\r\nlarge animals--is, structurally considered, also a mammal.\r\n\r\nFor various reasons, which will appear later, the domestic cat (which is\r\na member of the genus _Felis_) may serve as an instructive, as it is a\r\nfamiliar, example of a highly-organized mammal. Allied to the cat, and\r\nformed on so completely the same model as hardly to differ, save in size\r\nand colour, are the lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, pumas, ocelots,\r\nlynxes, and wild-cats of different kinds. What are commonly called\r\npole-cats are not really cats, but belong to a different \"family;\" while\r\ncivet-cats are not cats in the strict sense of that term. Civet-cats\r\npertain to a group of beasts called _Viverrines_ (_Viverridæ_), to which\r\nall ichneumons and mongouses (which appear to have been the domestic\r\ncats of the ancient Romans) as well as the bone-eating hyænas also\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\nThe viverrines and the cats, however, together form one great family to\r\nwhich the scientific name _Felidæ_ has been assigned. The pole-cats,\r\ntogether with the ermine, ferret, weasel, marten, sable, skunk, badger,\r\nthe otter and the bear, raccoon, coati-mondi, with the kinkajoo, panda,\r\n&c., all belong to another family. Of this family the bears are the\r\nlargest in size, and constitute a small group or \"genus\" called _Ursus_,\r\nwhence the whole family bears the designation _Ursidæ_.\r\n\r\nOur dogs (genus _Canis_) are, as every one knows, first cousins to\r\njackals and wolves and near allies of the different species of fox, the\r\nwhole forming a family--_Canidæ_.\r\n\r\nThe otter has been already referred to, and it may be thought that\r\nmention of the seals and sea-lions has been unintentionally omitted. But\r\nthe seals and sea-lions, in spite of a certain slight resemblance to\r\notters, due to similarity of habit, are not really near allies of the\r\nlatter. They (_i.e._, seals and sea-lions), together with the walrus,\r\nform, indeed, a very distinct family, which is termed _Phocidæ_, because\r\nits type, the common seal, belongs to a subordinate group, or \"genus,\"\r\nnamed _Phoca_.\r\n\r\nAll these families, _Felidæ_, _Ursidæ_, _Canidæ_, and _Phocidæ_ form\r\ntogether one greater group or \"order,\" to which, of course, these four\r\nfamilies are subordinate. This order is called \"_Carnivora_,\" because it\r\nis made up of carnivorous or flesh-eating beasts.\r\n\r\nThe other familiar beasts first referred to--our domestic cattle of all\r\nkinds--form, together with all swine, horses and all asses, deer,\r\nantelopes and camels, another great order of beasts called _Ungulata_,\r\nbecause the nails of their feet are so large and solid as to form\r\n\"hoofs.\" This order of hoofed-beasts, or ungulates, is a very large\r\norder, and is divided into two sub-orders, and in each sub-order are\r\nvarious families containing more or fewer genera.\r\n\r\nThe two sub-orders are characterized by the structure of the foot. The\r\ntoes of the hind foot, which are made use of in progression, are even in\r\nnumber in one sub-order and are odd-numbered in the other sub-order.\r\n\r\nThe sub-order of odd-toed ungulates, or _Perissodactyla_, includes in\r\nour day only the horses, asses, zebras, and quaggas (united together in\r\nthe family _Equidæ_); the tapirs, the rhinoceroses, and the little\r\nhyrax--the coney of Scripture. In ancient times, however, this sub-order\r\nwas a very large one, but the great majority of the forms belonging to\r\nit, which formerly lived, have now become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe sub-order of even-toed ungulates, or _Artiodactyla_, comprises all\r\noxen, sheep, goats, antelopes, giraffes, deer, chevrotains,[10] llamas,\r\nand camels. All these, from their practice of \"chewing the cud,\" are\r\ncalled \"ruminants,\" and they are multitudinous in kinds. The great\r\nplains of Southern Africa are the special home of most kinds of\r\nantelope, and the giraffe is exclusively African. Deer have their\r\nhead-quarters in Asia, though they exist in South America as well as\r\nthroughout the Northern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nBesides the ruminating artiodactyles there is also an extensive group of\r\nnon-ruminating artiodactyles, made up of all the various kinds of swine\r\n(including the American peccaries), together with the hippopotamus, now\r\nfound nowhere but in Africa. Distinct as are the ruminating and\r\nnon-ruminating artiodactyles now, they were in ancient time connected by\r\na great number of intermediate forms which have utterly passed away.\r\n\r\nThe llamas of South America represent the camels of the Old World, where\r\nthe latter are to-day exclusively found. When South America was\r\ndiscovered by the Spaniards, llamas were the only beasts of burthen\r\nfound there, and, indeed, the only cattle of any kind then and there\r\nexisting; although horses had formerly abounded and had become extinct\r\nin South America at a long anterior period.\r\n\r\nSomewhat allied to ungulates, but distinct from them, are the elephants,\r\nwhich form an order (_Proboscidea_) by themselves--an order once rich in\r\nmany species widely distributed over the earth.\r\n\r\nHardly less familiar than our domestic animals, are our hares, rabbits,\r\nmice, squirrels, and their allies, which together form an \"order\" called\r\n_Rodentia_ from the gnawing habits of its members which nourish\r\nthemselves on vegetable substances. This order of rodents is very rich\r\nin species, and consists of many genera grouped in several distinct\r\nfamilies--such, _e.g._, as the family of mice and rats (_Muridæ_), of\r\nsquirrels (_Sciuridæ_), of guinea-pigs and spine-bearing porcupines\r\n(_Hystricidæ_), &c. The largest form of rodent is the capybara (or\r\nriver-hog of the Rio de la Plata),--which is preyed on by the jaguar.\r\nThough a near ally of the little guinea-pig, it is as large as a hog.\r\nAmongst the more interesting rodents may be mentioned beavers,[11] the\r\nfur-bearing chinchilla, the jerboa (_Dipus_), the musk-rat (_Fiber_),\r\nand the rat-mole (_Spalax_). The jerboa has very long hind legs, and a\r\nhabit of jumping, so that it resembles superficially (but not really) a\r\nsmall kangaroo. The _Spalax_ is quite blind, and has the burrowing\r\nhabit, and somewhat the shape of the common mole. Some rodents are\r\nfitted to flit through the air in long jumps, by means of the wide\r\nextensibility of the skin of their flanks, which, when stretched out,\r\nacts as a parachute. Such forms are the flying squirrels, and a curious\r\nrodent called _Anomalurus_, from the exceptional clothing of the base of\r\nits tail, which is furnished with large scales at its under part.\r\n\r\nAnother order of beasts may here be referred to, because it affords\r\ninteresting examples of the co-existence of external resemblance without\r\nany real affinity. This order includes the insect-eating beasts, or\r\n_Insectivora_, and comprises the moles, hedgehogs, shrew-mice (which are\r\nnot really \"mice\" at all), and their allies. The _Insectivora_ and\r\n_Rodentia_ present us with a singular parallelism in the respective\r\nmodifications of structure, which are found in these two very distinct\r\norders. But the insectivorous forms (as might perhaps be expected from\r\ntheir less abundant food) are always smaller in size than are the\r\nparallel vegetable-eating groups of rodents. Indeed, one insectivore of\r\nthe genus _Sorex_ (the shrew-mouse genus) is the absolutely smallest\r\nmammal which is known to exist.\r\n\r\nAs examples of the parallelism referred to may be mentioned the moles\r\n(which resemble the rat-moles), the shrew-mice (which resemble true\r\nmice), the hedgehogs, and the less known spiny tanrec of Madagascar\r\n(which resemble porcupines in their clothing); certain graceful and\r\nactive tree-frequenting insectivores of the Indian Archipelago, _Tupaia_\r\n(which resemble squirrels); an aquatic African form, _Potomogale_ (which\r\nresembles the musk-rat); certain elephant shrews--long-legged, jumping,\r\nAfrican insectivores (which resemble the jerboa amongst rodents); and,\r\nlastly, the so-called flying lemur of the Philippine Islands, or\r\n_Galeopithecus_, which resembles the flying squirrel, and the curious\r\nrodent _Anomalurus_ before referred to.\r\n\r\nThe only beasts, however, which _truly_ fly are the bats, which form an\r\norder by themselves, well-named, from the structure of their wings,\r\n_Cheiroptera_. The bats which fly about in the twilight in this country,\r\nor sometimes in the afternoon of a warm day in winter, are all\r\ninsect-eating forms. But in the warm regions of the Old World, and of\r\nAustralia, there are large fruit-eating kinds, called \"flying foxes;\"\r\nwhile in South America there are blood-sucking bats, or vampires, some\r\nof which, as we shall hereafter see, present the most curious and\r\ninteresting modifications of structure in harmony with their peculiar\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nThe creatures which are in some respects the most interesting to us,\r\nbecause they are the most like ourselves in form, are the apes.\r\nMoreover, not only are they so like us in form, but they are so widely\r\nmarked-off from all other creatures except ourselves, that it seems\r\nimpossible they can have any real affinity to one more than to another\r\ngroup of mammals below man. Apes and man then together form one order,\r\nwhich as ranking first was named by Linnæus, _Primates_. With the apes\r\nare commonly associated certain animals called Lemurs, which inhabit the\r\nvicinity of the Indian Ocean, especially Madagascar. They have not,\r\nhowever, any real affinity to apes; and if they are to be placed in the\r\nsame order at all, they must be well distinguished from its other\r\nmembers. It has therefore been proposed[12] to divide the order Primates\r\ninto two sub-orders (as the hoofed order is divided into the \"odd-toed\"\r\nand \"even-toed\" sub-orders), one of these to include man and apes, and\r\nto be called, from the resemblance to the human form pervading it,\r\n\"_Anthropoidea_;\" the other sub-order to be termed \"_Lemuroidea_.\"\r\n\r\nThe first \"sub-order\" is divisible into three \"families.\" One of these\r\n(_Hominidæ_) contains man (forming the genus _Homo_), the second\r\n(_Simiadæ_) contains all the apes of the Old World only, while a third\r\n(_Cebidæ_) contains all those of America.\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Simiadæ_ are the orang, the chimpanzee, the gorilla, and\r\nthe long-armed apes (or Gibbons), which are the most man-like of all the\r\napes; and there can be no question but that there is very much less\r\ndifference in structure between these four kinds of apes and man, than\r\nthere is between them and the lowest of the apes--_i.e._, the marmosets.\r\n\r\nConcerning this resemblance, Buffon has observed, when speaking of the\r\nape, the most man-like (and so man-like) as to brain:[13] \"Il ne pense\r\npas: y a-t-il une preuve plus évidente que la matière seule, quoique\r\nparfaitement organisée, ne peut produire ni la pensée, ni la parole qui\r\nen est le signe, à moins qu'elle ne soit animée par un principe\r\nsupérieur?\"\r\n\r\nAs to the second sub-order, it contains some very curious forms. The\r\ntypical lemurs (which inhabit Madagascar) have long fox-like snouts and\r\nlong tails. Certain African forms (the genus _Galago_) are very active\r\nin their movements, and great leapers. A tailless group (the slender\r\nloris) is interesting, as presenting a diminutive quasi-human form,\r\nreflected, as it were, through a Lemurine prism, just as the rat-mole\r\nshows us a mole-form reflected through a rodent prism.\r\n\r\nA little animal, the Tarsier, which is found on the islands of Celebes\r\nand Borneo, is very exceptional in its structure. Still more so is the\r\naye-aye (_Cheiromys_). This very remarkable species was discovered by\r\nSonnerat in Madagascar in 1770, and was never again seen till 1844, when\r\na specimen was forwarded to Paris. It has now, however, become well\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nInhabiting the sea are many beasts, which are, by mistake, popularly\r\nspoken of as \"fishes.\" Such are the whales and the porpoises--animals\r\nwhich, in spite of their form and habit, suckle their young, and have\r\nhot blood, as all other mammals have. These creatures form an order by\r\nthemselves, called _Cetacea_.\r\n\r\nAnother order of aquatic beasts is termed _Sirenia_, and the animals\r\nwhich compose it were long confounded with the _Cetacea_, from which,\r\nhowever, they are widely divergent in structure, in spite of the\r\ngeneral similarity which exists between them in external appearance. The\r\norder _Sirenia_ contains but two existing genera. One of these is the\r\nnow well-known manatee (_Manatus_), the other is the dugong\r\n(_Halicore_)--an animal very similar to the manatee, and found in the\r\nrivers of regions about the Indian Ocean. A third form, the _Rhytina_,\r\nexisted in the Aleutian Isles till recent times, but was extirpated\r\nalmost as soon as discovered, from its incapacity for flight or defence,\r\nand from its flesh affording a welcome change of diet to hungry sailors.\r\n\r\nThe _Cetacea_ and _Sirenia_ are examples of creatures organized for a\r\ncompletely aquatic life--for never coming to land.\r\n\r\nThe forest-regions of South America offer to animal life so enormous a\r\nmass of foliage that it may not unjustly be termed a sea of verdure, and\r\ncreatures there exist which are specially organized for a completely\r\narboreal life--for never coming to the ground. Such creatures are the\r\nsloths, which pass their lives hanging back-downwards, suspended to the\r\nbranches by their huge claws. Thus, they sleep without effort (from the\r\npeculiar mechanism of their limbs), and they move slowly from tree to\r\ntree, having no need to hurry after food, since they live suspended in\r\nthe midst of a perennial banquet.\r\n\r\nNearly allied to the sloths were certain huge beasts, now extinct, which\r\nformerly inhabited the same Continent--such as the _Megatherium_ and\r\n_Mylodon_, which rivalled or exceeded our largest rhinoceroses in bulk.\r\nThey fed on the same food which nourishes the sloth, but obviously the\r\nbranches of no tree could sustain such monsters. They obtained their\r\nleafy pasture, therefore, by a different method. Rearing themselves on\r\ntheir massive hind legs and powerful tail, as on a tripod, they embraced\r\nthe trees with their vigorous arms, and swayed them to and fro, till the\r\ntree embraced was prostrated, and literally fell a prey to their\r\nefforts. These bulky creatures were protected against that danger which\r\nsuch a mode of life rendered imminent by a specially strong skull\r\nstructure, which enabled them to bear a broken head with but little\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nIn the same region of the earth are found the ant-eaters and armadillos,\r\nand more or less allied to them are the pangolins (_Manis_) of Africa\r\nand Asia. The horny scales which cover the bodies of the last-named\r\nanimals caused them for some time to be associated with reptiles rather\r\nthan with beasts, though they are true and perfect mammals. Lastly must\r\nbe mentioned the aard-vark (_Orycteropus_) of South Africa.\r\n\r\nAll these creatures, from the sloths to the aard-vark, are commonly\r\nassociated together in an order which is termed _Edentata_.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the orders of mammals yet mentioned agree in certain\r\nimportant details with respect to their reproductive processes, as well\r\nas in certain smaller anatomical peculiarities, and the whole of the\r\ncreatures included within these orders are (and will be) often spoken of\r\nas _Placental Mammals_.\r\n\r\nThe only beasts which it yet remains to speak of are grouped in two\r\nother orders.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is called the order _Marsupialia_, and comprises all\r\nopossums (_Didelphys_), kangaroos (_Macropus_), phalangers\r\n(_Phalangista_), the Tasmanian wolf (_Thylacinus_), the dasyures\r\n(_Dasyurus_), the bandicoots (_Perameles_), and their allies. With the\r\nexception of the true opossums (_Didelphys_), all the members of the\r\norder are found in Australia or its vicinity, and nowhere else in the\r\npresent day; although, as we shall better see hereafter, Europe once\r\npossessed animals closely allied to Australian forms of to-day--notably\r\nto a pretty little quadruped which bears the generic name _Myrmecobius_.\r\n\r\nAs last of the class of beasts, we have two extremely exceptional\r\nmammals (both found only in the Australian region), the duck-billed\r\nplatypus (_Ornithorhynchus_), and the _Echidna_. The first of these, as\r\nits name implies, has a muzzle quite like the bill of a duck, with a\r\nsquat, hairy body, and short limbs. The echidna is covered with strong,\r\ndense spines, and has a long and slender snout. These creatures together\r\nform the order _Monotremata_--an order which differs very much more from\r\nany other Mammalian order than any of the other orders of mammals differ\r\none from another.\r\n\r\nThus, that great group which embraces man and beasts, and which group\r\nranks as a \"class\"--the _class_ Mammalia--comprises (as we have now\r\nseen) a number of subordinate groups termed \"orders,\" the orders being\r\nmade up of families, and these again of genera.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible as yet (when hardly any anatomical facts have\r\nbeen even referred to) to give the characters of the class _Mammalia_.\r\nIt must at present suffice to point out that, in addition to mammary\r\nglands, the creatures have hot blood, and the body bears more or less\r\nhair--at least at some time of life.\r\n\r\nWe may now pass to the next class, that of birds--the class _Aves_. In\r\nspite of the great multitude of kinds which ornithologists\r\nenumerate--upwards of ten thousand species--there is very much less\r\ndiversity of form amongst birds than there is amongst beasts.\r\n\r\nStarting in the present class as in the preceding one from the most\r\nfamiliar kinds, we may begin with the domestic fowl. This is one of an\r\n\"order\" to which belong the peacock, all pheasants and tragopans (three\r\nforms which have their home in Central and Southern Asia), also the\r\nGuinea fowls (African forms), and the turkeys and curassows, which are\r\nAmerican representatives of the order. Besides these may be mentioned\r\npartridges, grouse, black-cock, the capercalzie and quails, and, lastly,\r\nthe megapodius or bush-turkey of Australia. This last is the only bird\r\nwhich hatches its eggs by artificial heat, depositing them in a mound of\r\nearth and decaying vegetable matter, wherein they are hatched\r\nfully-fledged, so that they can fly away immediately on leaving the egg.\r\nAll the birds yet mentioned are called gallinaceous birds, or _Gallinæ_,\r\nand sometimes _Rasores_ or \"Scratchers.\"\r\n\r\nMore or less allied to them are the doves and pigeons, which form the\r\norder _Columbæ_, in which the curious ground-pigeon _Didunculus_ is\r\nincluded--a form which presents an interesting resemblance to the\r\ncelebrated and extinct dodo of Mauritius, long known only by certain\r\npictures, and a foot and head preserved, one in the British Museum, and\r\nthe other in the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford.\r\n\r\nOur sparrows, robins, and all our song birds are members of an\r\nexceedingly numerous \"order\" \"_Paseres_.\" In it are included the crows\r\n(with those gaily-decorated crows, the Birds of Paradise, found only in\r\nNew Guinea and the Moluccas), the bower birds and the lyre bird of\r\nAustralia; the flycatchers, the pittas (or ground thrushes), the\r\nwater-ouzel, the weaver birds, the wrens, the tits, the creepers, the\r\nhoney-eaters, those African gems, the sun birds, and also the swallows.\r\n\r\nTo another order--the order _Macrochires_--belong those most beautiful\r\nof all birds, the humming birds, found only in America, and long thought\r\nto be allied with the really very different sun birds just mentioned.\r\nWith these may be associated the swifts (which have such marvellous\r\npowers of flight) and the wide-gaped goat-suckers or nightjars.\r\n\r\nWoodpeckers are considered to form an order (_Pici_) by themselves,\r\nwhile the cuckoos are thought to be near relations of the beautiful and\r\neccentric toncans, the plaintain-eaters, the touracous, the kingfishers,\r\nthe hoopoes, the bee-eaters, the hornbills, and the trogons, all, from\r\nthe cuckoos to the trogons, being included in the order _Coccyges_.\r\n\r\nThe parrots form an isolated group of birds--the order _Psittaci_. Their\r\nmost peculiar forms are the macaws on the one hand, and the brush-tailed\r\nloris on the other. The order _Accipitres_ includes all the birds of\r\nprey--that is to say, the eagles, falcons, hawks, buzzards, vultures,\r\nand owls. In this order is included the long-legged secretary bird,\r\nwhich looks like a cross between a hawk and heron.\r\n\r\nPelicans, gannets, cormorants (or shags), and darters go together to\r\nconstitute the order called _Steganopodes_. The flamingoes are isolated,\r\nand by themselves form the order _Odontoglossæ_. The same is the case\r\nwith the penguins, which have the order _Impennes_ assigned exclusively\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThe ducks and geese form alone the order _Lamellirostres_, in which is\r\nincluded the curious bird _Palamedea_, which is a goose adapted to live\r\nin trees in harmony with its South American forest habitat.\r\n\r\nThe rails and coots go with the bustards and cranes to constitute the\r\norder _Alectorides_. Similarly the auks, divers, puffins, terns, and\r\ngrebes, noddies, and guillemots may be associated together in one\r\norder--the order _Pygopodes_. The gulls and petrels form another\r\nassociation--the order _Gaviæ_; while the plovers, snipes, curlews,\r\npeewits, turnstones, &c., constitute the order _Limicolæ_. The order\r\n_Heridiones_ includes the herons, the bitterns, the storks, spoonbill,\r\nibis, &c.\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing birds have a multitude of points in common; indeed, so\r\nclose is the similarity of their structure that their subdivision into\r\norders is a matter of much difficulty and dispute. They are collectively\r\nspoken of as the _Carinatæ_, from the keeled form of their breast-bone.\r\n\r\nWidely apart from them stands another group made up almost entirely of\r\nlarge birds, which agree not only in having no power of flight, but also\r\nin certain significant structural characters, amongst which may be\r\nmentioned the absence of a keel on the breast-bone.\r\n\r\nThis latter group is sometimes spoken of as the order _Struthiones_ from\r\nthe ostrich (_Struthio_), which is its typical form. Sometimes these\r\nkeelless birds are called _Ratitæ_. Besides the ostrich, the rhea,\r\ncassowary, and emeu are included within the group; also the small and\r\nnocturnal _Apteryx_ of New Zealand and those giants of featherdom, the\r\nhuge species of dinornis, all also of New Zealand and all now extinct.\r\n\r\nWith this our list of birds might close, but for a bird which anciently\r\nexisted in Europe so strangely different from all modern kinds, that it\r\nmust certainly be here adverted to. This bird is the _Archeopteryx_,\r\nfound in fossil in the Solenhofen States.\r\n\r\nThe class Aves, like the class Mammalia, consists of animals with hot\r\nblood, but all birds have feathers and a number of other peculiarities\r\nof structure, as will appear later.\r\n\r\nThe next class to be adverted to is the class which includes all\r\nreptiles properly so-called--the class _Reptilia_.\r\n\r\nThe reptiles which exist in the world to-day may be classed in four\r\nwell-marked sets, each of which has the value of an \"order\"--(1)\r\ncrocodiles, (2) lizards, (3) serpents, and (4) tortoises. The names of\r\nthese creatures alone suffice to indicate the fact that the class of\r\nreptiles presents us with an extraordinary amount of diversity of form\r\nas compared with the class of birds with which, nevertheless, reptiles\r\nhave, as we shall hereafter see, very close relations. Indeed, in the\r\ndiversity of kinds which it contains, the class _Reptilia_ at the least\r\nfully equals the class Mammalia, especially if the extinct kinds are\r\ntaken into consideration. The number of species of reptiles, both living\r\nand extinct, much exceeds also the number of living and extinct mammals.\r\n\r\nTo begin once more with forms which are the least strange and unknown,\r\nwe may start with the little elegant and harmless lizards of our heaths\r\nand commons, which will serve as types of the order to which they\r\nbelong--the order _Lacertilia_. That order is an extremely numerous one,\r\ncontaining many families, differing much in form. Our English lizards\r\nare true lizards, belonging to the typical genus _Lacerta_ and to the\r\ntypical family _Lacertidæ_. The rather well-known large American lizard,\r\n_Iguana_, is the type of another and very extensive family (almost\r\nentirely confined to America), while a nearly-allied family (_Agamidæ_)\r\nis an Old World group. Amongst the curious forms found in the latter\r\nfamily may be mentioned the frilled and moloch lizards of Australia, and\r\nthose little harmless lizards of India which go by the formidable name\r\nof \"flying dragons\" (_Draco_). They are the only existing aërial\r\nreptiles--not that they can truly \"fly\" at all, but they are enabled to\r\ntake prolonged jumps, and to sustain themselves to a considerable extent\r\nin the air by means of the extremely distensible skin of their flanks\r\nwhich, when extended, is supported by a peculiar solid framework\r\nhereafter to be described. Some of the largest lizards are called\r\n\"monitors,\" and are common in Egypt; they belong to the family\r\n_Monitoridæ_.\r\n\r\nIn the warmest period of the year, certain lizards are found in the\r\nSouth of Europe, called geckos. They have a power of running, not only\r\nup walls, but across ceilings by means of a peculiar structure of their\r\ntoes. They are types of a large family (_Geckotidæ_) widely spread over\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nAnother large family (_Scincidæ_) has also its type in the South of\r\nEurope in the skink (_Scincus_), which was formerly supposed to possess\r\nmuch medicinal value. This large family contains a number of species\r\nwhich exhibit a series of gradations in structure leading to forms which\r\nhave the external aspect of serpents. One such form is the perfectly\r\nharmless slow-worm, or blind-worm, of our own country, which in spite of\r\nits scientific name, _Anguis fragilis_[14], is a legless lizard, and no\r\nsnake.\r\n\r\nOther lizards of a very different kind forming the family _Amphisbæidæ_\r\nare also legless, with the single exception of the genus _Chirotes_,\r\nwhich has a pair of anterior limbs, but no posterior ones. The name of\r\nthis family is derived from the similarity of appearance presented by\r\nboth ends of the body, so that either end looks as if ready to take the\r\nlead as \"head.\"\r\n\r\nA family of lizards familiar by name to us all from our childhood is the\r\nfamily of chameleons (_Chameleonidæ_). There are many species of\r\nchameleons, but they are found in the Old World only; they are among the\r\nmost exceptional and peculiar of all lizards, but there is one form\r\nwhich is yet more so.\r\n\r\nThis most exceptional of lizards is one found in New Zealand, and named\r\n_Sphenodon_. Its external aspect would not lead the ordinary observer at\r\nall to suspect that it is so remarkable a creature as its anatomy shows\r\nit really to be.\r\n\r\nThe order _Crocodilia_ contains, of course, the true crocodiles which\r\nare found both in the Old and New Worlds. It contains besides the\r\nalligators (which are peculiar to America), as well as the long and\r\nslender-snouted gavials which are now found only in India and Australia.\r\nAt one time the number of kinds of this order was very much greater than\r\nat present, and interesting structural modifications have taken place in\r\nit during the course of ages, as will be pointed out later.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the order of crocodiles makes a much nearer approach to\r\nmammals and birds--especially (strange as it may seem) to birds, than is\r\nmade by any other group of existing reptiles.\r\n\r\nReptiles, however, once existed have left their remains fossilized (in\r\nthe rocks of what is termed the \"secondary\" or \"mesozoic\" period), which\r\nreptiles in the structure of their skeleton approach much more closely\r\nto birds, and especially to birds of the ostrich order, than crocodiles\r\ndo. Amongst these reptiles may be mentioned the huge Iguanododon (type\r\nof the, extinct order _Dinosauria_), which once roamed over the Weald of\r\nKent, and has left its remains in the Isle of Wight and elsewhere. Such\r\nremains were collected by its discoverer, the late Dr. Mantell, and are\r\nnow preserved in our British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe crocodilia and some of the lizards of our own day are aquatic, but\r\nnone live constantly in the ocean, as do the cetacea amongst beasts.\r\nThis was, however, by no means always the case. In the secondary period\r\njust adverted to, huge marine reptiles (_Ichthyosauria_ and\r\n_Plesiosauria_) lorded it over the other then inhabitants of the deep,\r\nand presented some noteworthy resemblances to the whales and porpoises\r\nwhich have since succeeded them.\r\n\r\nBut other remains preserved in those same secondary rocks show us that\r\nin that period which has been so deservedly called \"the age of\r\nreptiles,\" not only did many huge species of the class stalk over the\r\nland (either browsing on its foliage or preying on their fellows), and\r\nmany others swarm in the then existing waters, but it shows us that the\r\natmosphere also had its reptilian tenants. Flying reptiles which formed\r\nthe now extinct order, _Pterosauria_, and which were some of small, some\r\nof very large size, as truly \"flew\" as do the bats of our own day fly,\r\nand by a very similar mechanism. Moreover, if the _Dinosauria_ present,\r\nas they do present, very noteworthy and interesting resemblances to\r\nbirds of the ostrich order, no less noteworthy and interesting are the\r\nresemblances presented by these flying reptiles to ordinary--_i.e._, to\r\n\"carinate\"--birds.\r\n\r\nThe orders of extinct reptiles just referred to are not the only ones\r\nwhich formerly existed and have now passed away. There were reptiles\r\nwith peculiarities in their teeth such as to have caused their order to\r\nbe named _Amnodontia_, and it is members of this extinct order that the\r\nlizard _Sphenodon_ more or less resembles, and it is this resemblance\r\nwhich gives it that special interest before noted.\r\n\r\nWe may now return from these very various extinct forms to enumerate\r\nother kinds of reptiles which exist to-day. But before doing so the fact\r\nmay be adverted to, that though amongst beasts many forms have become\r\nextinct, yet the proportion borne by the known extinct forms to the\r\nliving kinds is much less than amongst reptiles, and that while it is\r\nthe most highly-organized reptiles which have ceased to exist, the\r\nhighest mammals which are in any way known to us are those which at\r\npresent inhabit the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nIn passing from the orders of crocodiles and lizards to that of\r\nserpents--_i.e._, to the order _Ophidia_--we might select as first to be\r\nmentioned kinds which much resemble the legless lizards; but such kinds\r\nare not familiar ones in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe only serpents met with in England are but of three species--two\r\nharmless snakes and the common viper, which latter is the only really\r\npoisonous reptile in this country.\r\n\r\nOf the harmless snakes, the ringed or collared snake (_Tropidonotus_) is\r\nmuch the commoner and more widely diffused. It ought to escape\r\ndestruction on account of the ease with which it may be discriminated\r\nfrom the viper by means of the white collar-like mark which appears so\r\nconspicuously just behind its head.\r\n\r\nOur viper is the type of a large and poisonous family, but by no means\r\nall poisonous snakes are vipers. The deadly cobras belong to a different\r\ngroup, having much more affinity with our own harmless snakes than with\r\nthe vipers. The rattle-snakes again form a family (_Crotalidæ_) by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThere are such things as true sea-serpents, and they are poisonous. They\r\nare not, however, allies of any \"sea serpent,\" such as every now and\r\nagain figures in startling paragraphs in our journals. The true\r\nsea-serpents are snakes of small or moderate size, which have their\r\ntails flattened from side to side, and which inhabit the Indian Ocean.\r\nOf other serpents which are not poisonous, the family of boas and\r\npythons (which kill by crushing) is tolerably familiar to all who have\r\nvisited zoological collections. There are many beautiful and harmless\r\nsnakes, such as the families of tree-snakes and whip-snakes, but the\r\nsnakes which more or less resemble legless lizards are burrowing forms\r\nwhich have the habits and more or less the appearance of earth-worms,\r\nsuch as those which form the families of _Uropeltidæ_ and _Typhlopsidæ_.\r\n\r\nThe last existing reptilian order (_Chelonia_) includes, besides the\r\nland tortoises of very various dimensions, a variety of aquatic forms.\r\n\r\nThe best known of these in this country, is the marine family\r\n(_Chelonidæ_), to which the edible and tortoise-shell turtles belong.\r\nThe best known family in the United States and in the Continent of\r\nEurope, is the _Emydæ_, to which pertain the terrapins or ordinary river\r\ntortoises. Besides these, however, there is a very small family\r\n(_Trionicidæ_) of curious and exceptional forms, called mud-tortoises\r\n(_Trionyx_).\r\n\r\nThe creatures which have next to be glanced at are those familiar forms,\r\nthe frogs, toads and efts, which, together with their allies, form\r\nanother class,--the class _Batrachia_. These animals were long\r\nconfounded with reptiles but are really widely distinct from them. They\r\nare arranged in four orders, three of which have living representatives.\r\nThe creatures of the first order (the order of tailless Batrachians or\r\n_Anoura_)--frogs and toads--exist over almost all the habitable globe;\r\nand though the number of their kinds is very great, yet they are all\r\nextremely alike in organization. Many kinds (of both frogs and toads)\r\nare found to live in trees, the ends of their fingers and toes being\r\ndilated to enable them to cling to the surfaces of leaves. The most\r\nexceptional species of the whole group are the two tongueless toads, the\r\n_Pipa_ of South America and the _Daclytethra_ of Africa, the last-named\r\nkind being the lowest of all known animals provided with finger nails.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the frogs and toads are the efts so common in our\r\nponds. These familiar English forms are represented in other countries\r\nof the Northern Hemisphere by creatures, some of which (as we shall\r\nhereafter see) are of very great interest indeed. The whole group\r\nconstitutes the second Batrachian order--the order _Urodela_.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noteworthy forms of the order is the eft _Proteus_,\r\nwhich inhabits the dark, subterranean caverns of Carniola and Istria.\r\nAllied to this is the _Menobranchus_ of North America and the Axolotl of\r\nMexico. Other forms of the order are the American eft-genera _Spelerpes_\r\nand _Amblystoma_, the _Menopoma_, and the gigantic Salamander\r\n(_Cryptobranchus_) of Japan and China, the eel-like _Amphiuma_--with its\r\nvery long body and minute legs--and the two-legged _Siren_ of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe third order of Batrachians is one which contains very few species,\r\nbut these are very strange, for though allied to frogs they have the\r\nappearance of snakes, or rather perhaps of worms. With long and slender\r\nbodies (marked by many transverse wrinkles), devoid of every rudiment of\r\nlimb, they remind us of the before-noticed _Anguis_, _Typhlops_, and\r\n_Uropeltis_ amongst reptiles. The Batrachians in question (which belong\r\nto the genera _Cæcilia_ and _Siphonops_) form the order _Ophiomorpha_.\r\n\r\nThe fourth order of Batrachians is one which has entirely passed away\r\nand become extinct. It is the order _Labyrinthodonta_, and the species\r\nwhich composed it were, some of them, of large size, with great heads\r\nlike those of crocodiles. Others bore more or less resemblance to\r\nenlarged _Ophiomorpha_.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that frogs begin their existence in the water as\r\ntadpoles, which have the habits and mode of life of fishes. Thus, the\r\nclass _Batrachia_ naturally conducts us to the class _Pisces_, the class\r\nof true fishes. This class contains a prodigious variety of forms, and\r\nis far more rich in species than any other of the classes before\r\nenumerated--even that of birds.\r\n\r\nThe fishes most familiar to us--such as the perch, carp, mackerel, cod,\r\nherring, sole, turbot, salmon, pike, dory, and eel--all belong to one\r\ngreat order called _Teleostei_, and which is made up of what are called\r\n\"bony\" fishes, though there are some bony fishes which do not belong to\r\nit. To the same order also belong the Muroena, the electric eel\r\n(_Gymnotus_), the flying fishes (_Exocetus_ and _Dactyloptera_), the\r\nsucking fish (_Remora_), the pipe-fish and sea-horse (_Hippocampus_),\r\nthe diodon, the ostracion, the file-fish (_Balistes_), the largest of\r\nall fresh-water fishes (_Sudis gigas_ of South America), with a\r\nmultitude of other forms.\r\n\r\nCertain more or less singular Teleosteans are classed together in a\r\nsubordinate group of \"Siluroids\" (of which fish the _Silurus_ is a\r\ntype), and which group includes, amongst others, the singular, cuirassed\r\nfish Callichthys.\r\n\r\nA group of fishes, which is now very small, but which at an earlier\r\nperiod of the world's history was very large, includes within it all\r\nthose fishes which will be hereinafter occasionally spoken of as\r\n\"Ganoids,\" as they compose the order _Ganoidei_. Of all the forms of\r\nthis order, the sturgeon is that which is least unfamiliar to us. The\r\nGanoids are mostly fresh-water fishes and consist of the spoonbill-fish\r\n(_Polyodon_), the bony-pike (_Lepidosteus_), the African _Polypterus_,\r\nthe mud fish (_Lepidosiren_), and the curious Australian fish\r\n_Ceratodus_, which last is a singular instance of piscine survival.\r\n\r\nAnother order, _Elosmobranchii_, is made up of the sharks, together with\r\nthe skates (or rays) and the curious _Chimæra_. Amongst the skates may\r\nbe mentioned the celebrated torpedo or electric ray.\r\n\r\nThe three groups above enumerated contain almost all known fishes, but a\r\nfew other kinds, all of lowly organization, constitute two other groups\r\nof very different structure.\r\n\r\nOne of these groups is called _Marsipo-branchii_, and contains the\r\nlamprey, the _Myxine_ (or Glutinous Hag), and the _Bdellestoma_. They\r\nare fishes of parasitic habits and of relatively inferior structure.\r\n\r\nLast of all comes a creature of such exceptional build, so widely\r\ndifferent from, and so greatly inferior to, any kind of animal yet\r\nnoticed, that it may but doubtfully be reckoned as a fish at all. The\r\nanimal referred to is the lancelet (_Amphioxus_), which is a small,\r\nalmost worm-like animal, living in the sand on our own coasts, and also\r\nwidely distributed over other parts of the world. The _Amphioxus_ has no\r\ndistinct head or heart, and its breathing apparatus--its gill\r\nstructure--differs so much from that of all other fishes as to give a\r\nname to its \"order\" (which contains it alone)--the order\r\n_Pharyngobranchii_.\r\n\r\nWe have now, then, hastily surveyed no less than five \"classes\" of\r\nanimals--(1) Mammalia, (2) Aves, (3) Reptilia, (4) Batrachia, and (5)\r\nPisces.\r\n\r\nBut, as was said in the first beginning of this Essay,[15] \"classes\" are\r\nthe groups into which \"sub-kingdoms\" are divided, and which, by their\r\nunion, make up such \"sub-kingdoms.\"\r\n\r\nThe five classes above-mentioned together constitute the highest of\r\nthose sub-kingdoms into which the whole animal kingdom itself is\r\ndivided. This highest sub-kingdom is named VERTEBRATA, and is called the\r\nvertebrate sub-kingdom, because every creature which belongs to it\r\npossesses a \"spinal column,\" which is generally built up of bones, each\r\nof which is called a \"_Vertebra_.\"\r\n\r\nWe ourselves are members of the genus _Homo_, of the family _Hominidæ_,\r\nof the order _Primates_, of the class _Mammalia_, of the sub-kingdom\r\n_Vertebrata_, and it is desirable to treat this sub-kingdom at\r\nconsiderable length, both because it is, to us who are members of it,\r\nthe most interesting and important, and because, by treating it somewhat\r\nfully, a good example can be once for all given of biological\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nBut the number of animal kinds which belong to other sub-kingdoms vastly\r\nexceeds the total number of vertebrate animals, and the structural\r\ncontrasts found between different non-vertebrate species is very much\r\ngreater than any such contrasts as can be found to exist between any two\r\nmembers of the highest, or vertebrate sub-kingdom. This is only what we\r\nmight expect; for non-vertebrate animals--often spoken of collectively\r\nas \"_Invertebrata_\"--form several distinct sub-kingdoms, each of which\r\nhas a rank approximatively co-ordinate with that sub-kingdom to which we\r\nourselves belong. Nevertheless, since the members of the invertebrata\r\nsub-kingdoms are, speaking generally, much less known and familiar than\r\nare vertebrate animals, and as the structural differences between them\r\ncannot be pointed out till an initial acquaintance has been made with\r\ncomparative anatomy, for these reasons we may treat the various animal\r\nsub-kingdoms which have yet to be noticed at much less length than we\r\nhave treated the vertebrata. The details of their peculiarities and the\r\nvarious degrees of significance and interest which they present will\r\nbegin to appear when we proceed to treat of \"The Forms of Animals.\"\r\n\r\nThe last class of vertebrates is, as we have seen, constituted by the\r\nfishes, which are fishes properly so called. But there are many animals\r\nwhich are familiarly and improperly spoken of as \"Fishes,\" but which are\r\neven more below true fishes than whales and porpoises are above them.\r\nThus, we hear of cuttle-fishes, and a variety of creatures are spoken of\r\nas \"shell-fish,\" which are not in the least related to true fishes.\r\nIndeed, the many so-called \"shell-fish\" are not even nearly related one\r\nto another. Thus, the oyster and the lobster are both commonly thus\r\nnamed, but they belong respectively to two altogether distinct\r\nsub-kingdoms of the world of animals.\r\n\r\nThe oyster is an animal which belongs to a vast assemblage of species,\r\nwith much variety of form and structure, which, on account of their soft\r\nbodies (whether or not enclosed in shells), are called MOLLUSCA or\r\n\"Mollusks.\" This assemblage ranks as a sub-kingdom and contains within\r\nit at least four subordinate great groups, or \"classes.\" All snails and\r\nwhelks, with their allies, and also all cuttle-fishes, belong to the\r\nsub-kingdom of \"soft animals.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the most familiar of mollusks is the common snail, which may\r\nserve as a type of the \"class\" of mollusks to which it belongs--the\r\nclass _Gasteropoda_. The snail, with the slug, are representatives of\r\nland-forms of mollusca, but the bulk of the class and of the whole\r\nsub-kingdom are aquatic animals, such as the whelk (_Buccinum_),\r\nperiwinkle (_Littorina_), limpet (_Patella_), &c. The Gasteropods\r\ngenerally possess spirally coiled shells (like the cowry or whelk), but\r\nsome kinds have their shells in the form of simple cones--like a\r\nChinaman's cap--as, _e.g._, the limpet. There are a few Gasteropods in\r\nwhich the shell consists of a series of similar segments as is the case\r\nwith _Chiton_, while many are altogether naked. In some kinds the soft\r\nbody is drawn out into a number of tufted processes, as in Doris and\r\nEolis, and sometimes the body is almost worm-like, as in _Phylliroë_, or\r\nprovided with a pair of ring-like lateral processes and a rudimentary\r\nshell, as in the sea-hare _Aplysia_.\r\n\r\nNext above the Gasteropods comes a group of animals forming the class\r\n_Pteropoda_. These pteropods are small, active, oceanic,\r\nsurface-swimming creatures, many of which live in delicate glass-like\r\nshells, and some of which form a large part of the food of the whalebone\r\nwhale. They flit through the water by the aid of lateral processes which\r\nmuch resemble those before-mentioned as existing in the sea-hare. Allied\r\nto these pteropods is a curious little animal, the shell of which\r\nresembles a miniature elephant's tooth and which is named _Dentalium_.\r\n\r\nHighest of all the mollusca stand the cuttle-fishes, forming (with the\r\n_Nautilus_ and many extinct animals, such as ammonites and their allies)\r\nthe great class _Cephalopoda_. The Cephalopoda, such as the cuttle-fish\r\n(_Sepia_) and the Poulp (_Octopus_), have now become familiar objects\r\nthrough our aquaria, where their very eccentric forms and remarkable\r\nmovements naturally attract attention. To this group also belongs\r\n_Spirula_, the coiled and chambered shell of which is found so\r\nabundantly, but its soft tenant so very rarely. To it also belongs the\r\nextinct Belemnite, which was provided with a dense, conical internal\r\nshell, specimens of which found in rocks were at one time taken for\r\nthunderbolts. Of a lower grade of organization is the _Nautilus_, sole\r\nexisting representative of a great group of Cephalopoda (including the\r\nammonites and other forms) which has, with the above exception, long\r\nbecome entirely extinct.\r\n\r\nThe oyster is an animal which belongs to a much lower class of\r\nmollusca--namely, to the class called _Lamellibranchiata_, from the\r\nplate-like (or lamellar) structure of the gill. To that class also\r\nbelongs the scallop (_Pecten_), the mussel (_Magilus_), the fresh-water\r\nmussel (_Anodon_), the razor-shell (_Solen_), the cockle (_Cardium_),\r\nspecies with a long fleshy tube such as _Mya_, stone-perforating shells\r\nsuch as _Pholas_, and the well-known wood-boring \"ship-worm\"\r\n(_Teredo_)--which is no \"worm\" at all--with a multitude of other forms.\r\n\r\nCertain other animals (which, like the Lamellibranchs, all have a shell\r\ndivided into two valves) form another still lower class called\r\n_Brachiopoda_, a class which we may, at least provisionally, consider as\r\nbelonging to the mollusca. These _Brachiopods_ are also called\r\n\"Lamp-shells,\" from a certain resemblance which many of them show to the\r\nform of a classical lamp. They are interesting, because in very ancient\r\ntimes they seem to have held that place in the world's animal population\r\nwhich is now held by the Lamellibranchs, by which, as they died out,\r\nthey have been gradually replaced till but comparatively few forms\r\nsurvive. Some of these, however, are of great antiquity, and one of\r\nthem, _Lingula_, is, though still living, one of the most ancient of all\r\nknown animals.\r\n\r\nWe may next pass to a small sub-kingdom which includes the curious and\r\ninert animals before referred to[16] as \"Sea-squirts,\" Tunicaries or\r\nAscidians, and which constitute the sub-kingdom TUNICATA. These are\r\nmarine organisms of very simple but very peculiar structure which\r\nsometimes grow up in compound aggregations. Certain forms (_e.g._,\r\n_Pyrosoma_) are luminous at night and may be seen swimming about in the\r\nocean like so many red-hot urn-heaters. As we shall hereafter see, the\r\nreproductive processes and the earlier stages of existence of these\r\ncreatures possess much interest, and have afforded strong grounds for\r\nregarding them, in spite of their lowly organization, as very close\r\nallies of the highest animals or _Vertebrata_.\r\n\r\nReturning now to the \"lobster\" (lately mentioned as one of those animals\r\ncommonly called \"shell-fish\") we may regard it as an example of what is\r\nby far the most numerous of all the sub-kingdoms of animals. This\r\nsub-kingdom is made up of animals with jointed feet or \"Arthropods,\" and\r\nthe ARTHROPODA are subdivided into four classes--1, _Crustacea_; 2,\r\n_Myriapoda_; 3, _Arachnida_; and 4, _Insecta_; and it is to the first of\r\nthese four classes that the lobster belongs.\r\n\r\nThe class _Crustacea_ contains, besides the lobster (and its near\r\nallies, hermit-crabs, prawns, shrimps, and cray-fish), all crabs,\r\nincluding those very quaint-looking animals (now so often seen in our\r\nliving collections), the king-crabs (_Limulus_), and a variety of more\r\nor less strangely different forms such as the following:--\r\n\r\nCertain Crustaceans, of the group called _Ostracods_, have the hard\r\nouter coat of their body so peculiarly modified that they have quite the\r\nappearance of Lamellibranch Mollusks, and this resemblance is even more\r\nthan skin deep, as we shall see later.\r\n\r\nSome of another group, called _Copepoda_, become, when adult, so\r\ndegraded in structure as to have the appearance of mere worms, as\r\n_Lerneocera_ and _Tracheliastes_, and become strangely unlike the\r\ntypical forms (crabs and lobsters) of their class.\r\n\r\nOther animals of the class _Crustacea_, which animals form the order\r\n_Cirripedia_ (barnacles and acorn-shells), bear such an external\r\nresemblance to mollusks that they were actually classed by Cuvier in the\r\nclass _Mollusca_. In some of them--the Barnacles which commonly attach\r\nthemselves to the bottoms of ships--the head grows from above downwards\r\nto a relatively enormous degree, forming the long stalk or \"peduncle,\"\r\nat the lower end of which the small body with its limbs hangs suspended.\r\n\r\nIn another group, _Rhizocephala_, the form of the adult becomes yet more\r\nstrange. These creatures are parasitic on other crustacea. Having\r\nattached themselves to the surface of the soft abdomen of the Hermit\r\ncrab, the head of the Rhizocephalon grows out into it as so many\r\nroot-like processes, from which condition the group has received its\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe numerous and long extinct group of _Trilobites_ also belongs to the\r\nclass _Crustacea_.\r\n\r\nThe next class, _Myriopoda_, consists of the hundred-legs (centipedes),\r\nand thousand-legs (millipedes), which present us with some of the best\r\nexamples of creatures the bodies of which are composed of a longitudinal\r\nseries of similar segments. Allied to them is a very exceptional animal\r\nfound in Africa and New Zealand, and called _Peripatus_, the anatomy of\r\nwhich presents many significant peculiarities.\r\n\r\nThe third class of Arthropods (_Arachnida_) consists of the scorpions\r\nand spiders with their poor relations, the mites and tics, together with\r\nthe very peculiarly-shaped _Pycnogonida_ (which present us with a good\r\nimage of \"no body\"--being all legs and no body), and the singular\r\nworm-like parasite _Linguatula_. Lastly, we come to the most\r\nzoologically important and numerous of all the classes of\r\nArthropods--namely, to the \"class\" of insects--_Insecta_. Therein we\r\nmeet with the power of flight in its most perfect form--_i.e._, in the\r\nDragon-flies--and most of the species are aërial in their adult (or\r\n_Imago_) condition. Some, however, are burrowers as, for example, the\r\nmole-cricket--an insect which presents some curious analogies in\r\nstructure to the beast referred to in its name. Amongst insects may be\r\nmentioned the most familiar of all, the House-fly (which belongs to the\r\norder _Diptera_), and Beetles of all kinds (which constitute the order\r\n_Coleoptera_), some of which latter are luminous, as is the well-known\r\nglow-worm, and the exotic beetles _Pyrophorus_. Another order\r\n(_Orthoptera_) is made up of the earwigs, cockroaches, crickets,\r\ngrass-hoppers, and their allies the locusts, with Bamboo-insects and the\r\ncurious walking-leaf (so-called from their resemblance to a Bamboo twig\r\nand a foliage leaf respectively), the praying mantis, and other curious\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nBees and Ants, which belong to the order _Hymenoptera_, are, as every\r\none knows, celebrated for their wonderfully complex instincts and\r\ncommunity-life (which will occupy us later), and to the same order also\r\nbelong the Ichneumon insects, which are provided with long appendages at\r\nthe hinder ends of their bodies wherewith to pierce the bodies of\r\nanimals in order to deposit their eggs within them, or to pierce the\r\nsubstance of plants, so producing \"galls\" which are structures of much\r\ninterest from several points of view.\r\n\r\nButterflies and Moths form another order of insects called\r\n_Lepidoptera_, amongst which may be mentioned as (having to be referred\r\nto hereafter) the true butterflies (_Papilio_), and the hawkmoths (some\r\nof which in their flight so much resemble Humming-birds), the clear-wing\r\nmoths, and those moths the grubs of which are known as \"silk-worms,\" and\r\ncertain moths of the genera _Solenobia_ and _Psyche_.\r\n\r\nThe numerous group of bugs is allied to the plant-lice (_Aphides_),\r\nwhich so often infest our Pelargoniums when kept in dwelling-rooms.\r\nAllied to them, again, are the small creatures the nature of which was\r\nso long disputed, though familiar to commerce as \"Cochineal.\" Really,\r\nthey are small, singularly inert, plant-lice, which adhere to the\r\nsurface of certain \"Cacti.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dragon-flies, before referred to, are the types of the order\r\n_Neuroptere_.\r\n\r\nAll the insects above mentioned, save the House-fly, have four wings, or\r\nelse none; but that familiar form may serve as the type of the\r\ntwo-winged order (_Diptera_) to which belong all flies and\r\ngnats--including, of course, the Mosquito--and the numerous \"Bots,\" one\r\nof which (the Tsee-Tsee fly) is so fatal to cattle in Africa.\r\n\r\nFinally, amongst insects may be mentioned the wingless, but active order\r\nof fleas (_Aphaniptera_), the wingless but sluggish lice (_Aptera_), and\r\nthe jumping and wingless springtails (_Thysanura_).\r\n\r\nIn leaving the class of insects, we leave all the more highly-organized\r\nInvertebrata. But the next group to which we may direct our attention is\r\none which is exceedingly numerous, and contains a very varied assemblage\r\nof forms. This group is the \"sub-kingdom\" of Worms, VERMES. First\r\namongst its contents may be mentioned the higher or true \"worms,\" such\r\nas the earth-worm (_Lumbricus_), the leech (_Hirudo_), the sea-mouse\r\n(_Aphrodite_), and their allies, together with the worms which live in\r\ntubes, which are called _Tubicolous_-\"_Annelids_,\" because the whole\r\nclass of these higher worms bears the name _Annelida_.\r\n\r\nIn this connexion may be mentioned certain exceptional vermiform\r\ncreatures, about the affinities of which naturalists dispute.\r\n\r\nOne of these is a marine creature (called _Sagitta_, from the way in\r\nwhich it shoots like an arrow through the water), which has many\r\naffinities to Arthropods.\r\n\r\nAnother is a most remarkable worm, which has been found in the Bay of\r\nNaples, and is called _Balanoglossus_. It is the type of a group called\r\n_Enteropneusta_. To it reference will have again and again to be made on\r\naccount of certain singularities in its structure.\r\n\r\nA very distinct class of creatures is termed _Bryozoa_ (or _Polyzoa_),\r\nand is composed of very minute animals which live in compound\r\naggregations, and often grow up in an arborescent manner. The common\r\nsea-mat (_Flustra_) is one example of the class, and another--a good\r\ntype--is called _Plumatella_. The _Bryozoa_ have many affinities with\r\nthe _Mollusca_, to which some naturalists consider them to belong.\r\n\r\nOther worms form the class _Nematoidea_, of which many are parasitic and\r\nmany not so. Amongst the better known of the former may be mentioned the\r\nworms which tease children (_Ascarides_), the guinea-worm (_Filaria_),\r\nthe scourge of Germans who eat raw meat (_Trichina_), the deadly\r\nblood-parasite of the Nile (_Bilharzia_), and many others.\r\n\r\nAnother class (_Trematoda_) is made up of parasites called \"Flukes,\" to\r\nsome of which (_e.g._, _Monostomum_) reference will have hereafter to be\r\nmade with respect to their processes of development.\r\n\r\nThe class _Turbellaria_ contains a variety of other worms of a lowly\r\nkind, one or two of which (_e.g._, _Borlesia_) live coiled up in complex\r\ntangles which, if unravelled, would attain a length of forty feet.\r\nAmongst the commoner kinds may be mentioned the worm _Nemertes_, and all\r\nworms called _Planariæ_ (which are mostly fresh-water, though some live\r\non land), allied to the flukes.\r\n\r\nThe class of tape-worms (_Cestoidea_) is one most numerous in its kinds,\r\nwhich are all completely parasitic in habit. Some of them are so fatal\r\nin their effects that they are estimated to occasion every seventh death\r\nwhich occurs in Iceland, and they cause mortality amidst our own flocks,\r\nproducing in sheep the disease known as the \"staggers.\"\r\n\r\nCertain minute organisms, familiarly known as \"Wheel-Animalcules,\" or\r\nRotifers, form the \"class\" _Rotifera_. They have gained their name\r\nthrough an apparently (though, of course, not really) rotary motion, of\r\nthat end of their bodies at which the mouth is situated. Here also may\r\nbe mentioned certain curious aquatic worms called _Gasterotricha_, which\r\nare closely allied to the wheel animalcules.\r\n\r\nFinally may be mentioned the class _Gephyrea_, containing animals,\r\nworm-like indeed in form, but which have much apparent affinity to the\r\ngroup next to be spoken of--the group of star-fishes and their allies.\r\nAmongst the _Gephyrea_ may be mentioned the worms called _Sipunculus_\r\nand _Priapulus_.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the sub-kingdom containing the star-fishes--the\r\nsub-kingdom ECHINODERMA, which includes, besides the star-fishes (or\r\n_Asteridea_), all sea-eggs or sea-urchins (_Echinidea_), the\r\nbrittle-stars _Ophiuridea_, as well as the elongated soft animals called\r\nsea-cucumbers, or _Holothuridea_, some of which latter are known as the\r\nJapanese edible, \"Trepang.\"\r\n\r\nBesides these groups there are still surviving a few creatures\r\n(_Comatula_ and _Pentacrinus_) belonging to the class of \"sea-lilies,\"\r\nor _Crinoidea_, creatures which once lived in countless multitudes, but\r\nhave now almost entirely passed away. All these crinoids were like\r\nstar-fishes on stalks, and of the existing forms, _Pentacrinus_ still\r\npasses the whole of its life, and _Comatula_ its youth, in a stalked\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe next great primary division, or sub-kingdom of animals, is\r\nCOELENTERA, and a good type of the coelenterates, the sea anemone\r\n(_Actinia_), has now become a familiar object to us in our aquaria.\r\nThese animals are plant-animals, or zoophytes, and some of them build up\r\ncoral-reefs, or islands, and it is one kind which produces the red coral\r\nof commerce. Forms essentially similar, but the solid supporting\r\nframework of which is of a softer nature, are such as _Alcyonium_ and\r\n_Pennatula_. All these belong to the \"class\" _Actinozoa_. There are\r\nother coelenterates of an active free-swimming habit, such as _Beröe_\r\nand _Cydippe_, which are balls of glassy transparency displaying\r\niridescent hues as they move rapidly through the water by means of their\r\npeculiar locomotive organs.\r\n\r\nOther coelenterates, of the same essential type but of simpler\r\nstructure, form the class _Hydrozoa_. Amongst these may be mentioned the\r\nlittle _Hydra_ of our ponds, which will often come before us in our\r\nsurvey of animal life. Some compound forms of Hydrozoa simulate the\r\ncompound Actinozoa; such are the calcareous millipores, and those with a\r\nsofter structure, called \"corallines,\" such as _Eudendrium_ and many\r\nothers. The Portuguese man-of-war (_Physalia_) and the various forms of\r\njelly-fish (_Medusæ_) all belong to the _Hydrozoa_, as also does a very\r\ncurious and very elementary form, to which the name _Tetraplatia_ has\r\nbeen given.\r\n\r\nNext we come to the group of sponges, SPONGIDA, some of which--as the\r\nnow well-known _Euplectella_--are of marvellous beauty and delicacy of\r\nstructure; while others, as the sponge of commerce, are of much greater\r\nsimplicity of form. Simplest of all the sponges is the sponge called\r\n_Ascetta Primordialis_. Some sponges have a horny, some a calcareous,\r\nand some a siliceous skeleton, and (strange as it may appear) some have\r\na habit of boring into shells, and living in the excavations they make.\r\n\r\nAn animal recently discovered, _Dicyema_, may at this initial stage of\r\nour inquiry be left with its place and affinities undetermined. It is a\r\nminute worm-like creature of most exceptionally simple structure, which\r\nlives parasitically within cuttle-fishes.\r\n\r\nWe now pass to animals (if so they are really to be considered) which\r\nare the lowest and simplest of all, and which are mostly microscopic in\r\nsize, and may be grouped together under the term HYPOZOA, or under the\r\ngenerally employed name _Protozoa_. With very few exceptions these\r\nanimals are aquatic, and if terrestrial they are found in damp\r\nlocalities. Some are marine, others are fresh-water organisms.\r\n\r\nThe highest of the group are the animalcules, which are named\r\n_Infusoria_, most of which are freely swimming organisms, though a\r\ncertain number of them live fixed to some supporting body.\r\n\r\nAnother group of _Hypozoa_ is that termed _Gregarinida_, a group made up\r\nof very lowly parasites, such as are often found tenanting the\r\nintestines of insects as well as those of higher animals. Finally, we\r\nhave the group of _Rhizopoda_, animals which have the faculty of\r\nprojecting and retracting (so to say, at will) filamentary or conical\r\nprocesses of their semi-fluid substance, such processes being the\r\n_Pseudopodia_, which were referred to earlier.[17]\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Rhizopoda_, the most complex and beautiful are the delicate\r\nand symmetrical creatures known as _Radiolaria_,[18] the siliceous\r\nskeletons of which are amongst the most remarkable of microscopic\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nAllied to them are the simpler _Heliozoa_, of which the after-mentioned\r\n_Actinophrys_ may be taken as a type.\r\n\r\nNext come the _Flagellata_, or minute creatures which swim about by\r\nmeans of one or two whip-like processes, whence the name of the group.\r\n\r\nLast of all is the group of _Foraminifera_, animals which are well\r\nworthy of note, seeing that, though they are each but as it were a\r\nminute particle of structureless jelly, they manage to build most\r\ncomplexly-formed, generally calcareous, shells, or to pick up from the\r\nsand of the sea minute particles, which they agglutinate around them\r\nwith marvellous neatness and precision. Their calcareous shells are\r\ngenerally pierced by a multitude of minute pores, through which the\r\nlittle creatures protrude their _pseudopodia_. It is from these pores\r\n(or _foramina_) that the group receives its name. All _Foraminifera_,\r\nhowever, are not provided with shells. Some, as the _Amoeba_, are\r\nnaked, and the simplest of all animals, _Protogenes_ and _Protamoeba_,\r\nconsist of but a minute particle of semi-fluid jelly, or protoplasm,\r\nnaked and as devoid of every external protection as it is of internal\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nWe have thus descended to the bottom of the animal kingdom, and passing\r\nfrom these rudimentary forms, which are generally reckoned as animals,\r\nwe may next survey in ascending order the different organisms which\r\ntogether compose the kingdom of Plants, a group much less rich in\r\nspecies than is the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of that kingdom are very simple creatures, but little\r\ndifferent, to all appearance, from the lowest animals. As an example of\r\nsuch we may take the minute plant _Protococcus_, which is an humble\r\nmember of the great group of _Algæ_, to which all sea-weeds belong. Not\r\nall of this important tribe, however, are marine. Many are found in\r\nfresh water--such as the protococcus itself, and many of the green\r\nvegetable threads known as _Conferræ_. Some even live on land, and draw\r\ntheir moisture from the atmosphere. The _Algæ_ are exceedingly varied in\r\ntheir structure; some, like the protococcus, being of extreme\r\nsimplicity; others attaining a large size, and presenting the appearance\r\nof a stout stem with branches and leaves.\r\n\r\nThe Algæ are divisible into the green-spored[19] (_Chlorospermeæ_), the\r\nrose-spored (_Florideæ_), and the olive-spored (_Melanospermeæ_).\r\n\r\nIt is in the first division that the _Protococcus_ may be placed, as\r\nalso those microscopic plants called _Diatoms_ and _Desmids_. The\r\nformer, the _Diatomaceæ_, are a very numerous group of minute organisms,\r\nsome of which are used as test objects for microscopes. They contain in\r\ntheir outer coat or case a relatively large portion of silex, and their\r\nremains here and there form deposits--vast beds many feet in\r\nthickness--known as \"tripoli,\" and used for polishing. The minute\r\nparticle of their protoplasm is contained within the siliceous case.\r\nThey may be entirely free, or cohere in aggregations, or be attached to\r\na supporting surface by a slender stalk, which may ramify and bear a\r\nlittle siliceous case or \"frustule\" at the end of each branch.\r\n\r\nThe desmids (or _Desmidiaceæ_) are green and devoid of silex, though\r\ntheir protoplasm is enclosed in hard or flexible cases, often marked\r\nwith beautiful and characteristic patterns.\r\n\r\nBoth diatoms and desmids may cohere together, forming more complex\r\nmasses; but another creature allied to _Protococcus_ is noted for its\r\nmode of cohesion. This is the microscopic plant _Volvox_, the\r\nindividuals of which cohere so as to form spheroidal aggregations, which\r\nswim about by the action of filamentary prolongations of their\r\nprotoplasm, such prolongations reminding us of the pseudopodia of\r\nradiolarians and other rhizopods.\r\n\r\nAmongst these simplest plants may be also mentioned the curious\r\nthread-like organisms, which, on account of their remarkable and as yet\r\nunexplained movements, are called _Oscillatoriæ_.\r\n\r\nAnother curious vegetable organism which may here be mentioned is\r\n_Vaucheria_. It is a green, thread-like plant, which may be several\r\ninches long, and which at one stage of its existence (when it is what is\r\ncalled a \"spore\") swims about by pseudopodial prolongations of its\r\nprotoplasm.\r\n\r\nSome few of the _Chlorospermeæ_ are large and conspicuous organisms.\r\nSuch, _e.g._, is _Caulerpa_, which abounds on warm, sandy coasts, and on\r\nwhich turtles browse. Though, as we shall hereafter see, it is really as\r\nsimple in structure as a particle of yeast, it yet presents a very\r\ncomplicated external figure.\r\n\r\nSome of the great group of _Algæ_ attain enormous dimensions. Thus,\r\n_Macrocystis_ (one of the _Melanospermæ_), of the Southern Ocean, may be\r\neven 700 feet in length. Another kind, _Lessonia_, forms submarine\r\nforests, with stems like the trunks of trees.\r\n\r\nThe group of _Floridiæ_ includes the delicate and elegant sea-weeds,\r\nwhich are amongst the most admired vegetable productions of our coasts.\r\nThey are of interest, on account of various peculiarities in their\r\nreproductive processes.\r\n\r\nOther lowly plants may, at least provisionally, be placed in the great\r\ngroup to which mushrooms and truffles belong--the group of _Fungi_--a\r\ngroup the members of which agree in certain exceptional phenomena of\r\nfunction,[20] as well as of structure and composition--as they are\r\nexceptionally nitrogenous.\r\n\r\nAmongst the lowest which we may for convenience provisionally include in\r\nthis group may be mentioned minute _Vibrios_, such as the _Bacteria_ so\r\nmuch talked of in connexion with spontaneous generation, and the small\r\nplant which by its growth produces fermentation--the yeast-plant\r\n(_Saccharomyces_).[21] Closely allied to the yeast-plant are the\r\n\"moulds\" which grow on organic matters such as _Penicillium_, _Mucor_,\r\n_Saprolegna_, _Phytophthora_, the last of which is the potato disease.\r\n\r\nA singular group of organisms goes by the name of _Myxomycetes_. These\r\nenigmatical creatures have been classed in turn as animals and as\r\nplants, and, indeed, at one period of their existence they seem to have\r\nmore resemblance to the former, while at another stage of their life\r\nhistory they must unquestionably be ranked as plants. When young, they\r\nare in a semi-fluid condition, and so move that they seem, as it were,\r\nto flow over the body on which they rest. They grow upon the bark of\r\ntrees or on leaves and decayed wood. They exhibit movements like those\r\nof the amæbæ and are said to engulph nutritious matters which come in\r\ntheir way.\r\n\r\nThe dry-looking, green, grey, red or yellow vegetable structures which\r\nencrust our rocks, walls, and trees, and which are called _Lichens_,\r\nform a group of plants curiously intermediate between Fungi and _Algæ_.\r\n\r\nPlants somewhat higher in the scale of vegetable life are those which\r\nare termed liverworts (_Hepaticæ_), including the scale-mosses\r\n(_Jungermanniaceæ_) and _Marchantia_. These plants, as we shall see, are\r\ninteresting on account of the variations to be found in the forms of\r\ndifferent genera. In many, there is no stem, but only a connected series\r\nof green disk-like expansions, while others have a distinct stem with\r\nleaf-like outgrowths.\r\n\r\nTwo genera of aquatic plants (_Chara_ and _Nitella_) constitute another\r\ngroup of plants called _Characeæ_. These will be hereafter referred to\r\nboth on account of peculiarities in their structure and on account of a\r\npeculiar motion of protoplasm which is easily to be seen[22] in them.\r\n\r\nMosses (_Musci_) are familiar objects to every one in this country, and\r\nallied to them are the so-called \"club-mosses\" or _Lycopods_, which form\r\na sort of green sward in so many parts of the warmer regions of the\r\nearth. To one of the lycopods, called _Selaginella_, reference will\r\nhereafter be made in connexion with its very instructive reproductive\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nCertain humble plants, in some of which the foliage leaves present a\r\nsuperficial resemblance to those of a four-leaved clover, are popularly\r\ncalled pepperworts; by botanists, _Rhizocarpeæ_ or _Marsiliaceæ_. They\r\nare creeping or floating stemless plants which inhabit ditches or\r\ninundated places. They are scattered over both the Old and New Worlds,\r\nbut are chiefly found in temperate latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe horse-tails (_Equisetaceæ_) are also found in most parts of the\r\nworld, though wanting in Australia and New Zealand. They inhabit wet and\r\nsandy places, and sometimes are of a considerable size even in the\r\npresent day, but in ancient geological periods they attained the\r\nproportions of trees.\r\n\r\nThis group leads us on to their allies the ferns which form a very large\r\nnatural group _Filices_ or _Pteridophytes_--a group now familiar to\r\nevery one interested in plants. Common as ferns are in our own country,\r\nthey are far more abundant and attain to a much greater size in southern\r\nlatitudes--notably in New Zealand and various Pacific islands.\r\n\r\nAll the plants hitherto enumerated, from the protococcus to the\r\ntree-ferns inclusive, together form what is commonly regarded as one\r\ngreat primary division or \"sub-kingdom\" of vegetals called CRYPTOGAMIA.\r\nIn no plant belonging to this sub-kingdom--in no single cryptogam--is\r\nany flower ever developed. These form the great group which is often\r\nspoken of as \"flowerless plants.\"\r\n\r\nThe other primary division of vegetable organisms consists of all plants\r\nwith flowers, and is termed PHANEROGAMIA, and is subdivided into two\r\nsections,[23] very unequally numerous. To the first section of\r\nphanerogams--a section containing comparatively few kinds--belong all\r\nfirs, pines, yews, junipers, araucarias, and a most remarkable African\r\nplant, _Welwitschia_, which has never more than two leaves, though these\r\nattain enormous dimensions. All these plants are collectively spoken of\r\nas conifers, or _Coniferæ_. Besides these, certain curious southern\r\nforms called Cycads are also associated in this section. To this\r\nsection, thus composed of conifers and cycads, the name GYMNOSPERMS is\r\ngiven, from the naked mode of development of their young seeds. These\r\ngymnosperms are also characterized by having such peculiar and\r\ninconspicuous flowers that the ordinary observer would hardly apply that\r\nterm to denote their floral organs.\r\n\r\nAll the plants which yet remain to be noticed, and which belong to the\r\nsecond and very much larger section of the PHANEROGAMIA are spoken of as\r\n_Angiosperms_. Their seeds are, from their first appearance, in a very\r\ndifferent condition from those of gymnosperms, and their flowers are\r\ngenerally conspicuous. To this group, therefore, belong all the familiar\r\nornamental plants of our gardens, and all the brightly coloured natural\r\nornaments of our fields, as well as a number of herbs and trees, the\r\nflowers of which, though truly flowers, are not commonly recognized as\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\nThis group of Angiospermous flowering plants is divided into a great\r\nnumber of natural groups or \"orders.\" Of these there are about 275, and\r\nthey are grouped in two sets or classes, which are separated one from\r\nanother, as we shall hereafter see, by differences as to their modes of\r\ngrowth, the structure of their seeds, the numbers of the parts of their\r\nflowers, and the course of the veins in their leaves.\r\n\r\nFirst amongst the Angiospermous flowering plants may be mentioned the\r\ngrasses forming the order _Gramineæ_, including under that term the\r\ntree-like bamboos (of multitudinous uses), with the rice plant, and all\r\nthe grain-bearing herbs, all of which are grasses. Thus, with much\r\nreason may it be said of man, that \"all flesh is grass;\" for with the\r\nexception of the piscivorous Esquimaux, the exclusively flesh-eating\r\nGouchos, the population of Australia, and the people of the Molluccas\r\nwho nourish themselves on sago--which is the produce of a palm--with\r\nthese and a few more exceptions, the staple food of the human race is\r\none or another form of grass. It is, indeed, a remarkable fact that men\r\nof such varied races so widely spread should have thus selected as their\r\nfood objects so little tempting in appearance, and so small and so\r\ninconspicuous as the seeds of grasses!\r\n\r\nAllied to the grasses are the sedges (forming the order _Cyperaceæ_),\r\nand the rushes (_Juncaceæ_). The apparently insignificant, but really\r\ninteresting duckweeds (_Pistiaceæ_) should also be noted with the\r\nbullrushes (_Typheæ_), and the arums (_Aroideæ_). This last-mentioned\r\norder, familiar to us by the kind known as \"Lords and Ladies,\" presents\r\nsome climbing forms in tropical countries. Generally acrid, some\r\nspecies, when in flower, even produce headache and vomiting; at least an\r\nexplorer was attacked with these symptoms after gathering forty\r\nspecimens of _Arum dracunculus_. The order is also interesting from\r\nexperiments as to vegetable heat, which have been made with the flowers\r\nof some of its species.\r\n\r\nThe screw-pines (_Pandanaceæ_) are not \"pines\" at all, any more than\r\n\"pine-apples\" are pines. They are, indeed, trees or shrubs, which, from\r\none point of view, may be regarded as gigantic bulrushes. The flowers of\r\ncertain species are in some places eaten as the solid equivalent of a\r\nlove potion. Allied to the plants of the last-mentioned order are the\r\npalms (_Palmaceæ_), which are the first really large trees we come to\r\nafter leaving the tree-ferns and the gymnosperms. Amongst the more\r\nnoteworthy palms may be mentioned the palmetto (_Chamærops_) of Southern\r\nEurope (a summer ornament of our public gardens), the date palm, the\r\nareca palm, the sago palm, the cocoa palm, the rattan palm--a natural\r\ncordage--and _Seaforthia_, so remarkable for its graceful and elegant\r\nform.\r\n\r\nNext may be enumerated the great order of lilies (_Liliaceæ_), to which\r\nthe homely and useful onion, leek, garlic, chive, and asparagus belong,\r\nno less than a multitude of lovely flowers.\r\n\r\nThe New Zealand flax (_Phormium tenax_), and all the magnificent yuccas\r\nand aloes, together with our English butcher's broom (_Ruscus\r\naculeatus_), which has not a little botanical interest (as being the\r\nonly British shrub which belongs to the group called \"Monocotyledons\")\r\nalso belong to this order. Closely allied to the lilies are the\r\namaryllids (_Amaryllidaceæ_), amongst which are the agaves, with their\r\ngigantic flower stems, sometimes forty feet high, supporting a\r\nmultitudinous crop of flowers, the product and termination of a life.\r\n\r\nTo these follow the pine-apples (_Bromeliaceæ_) all originally from\r\nAmerica, the useful bananas and plantains (_Musaceæ_), and the\r\nginger-plants (_Zingiberaceæ_), tropical herbs, generally of great\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe underground parts of certain tropical plants (_Dioscoreaceæ_) are\r\nknown as \"yams.\" A representative of this order exists in England in the\r\nclimbing black bryony (_Tamus_) of our hedges, and to the same group\r\nbelongs the very singularly stemmed elephant's foot, or tortoise-tree\r\n(_Testudinaria elephantipes_). The last-named plant is a native of the\r\nCape of Good Hope, where it has been known as Hottentot's bread, because\r\nthe soft interior of its swollen base was at one time eaten by the\r\nnatives of that region, who have, however, now abandoned it to the\r\nbaboons.\r\n\r\nLastly, in this connexion may be mentioned the very interesting and\r\nbeautiful group of orchids (_Orchidaceæ_), many of which live high up\r\nin the air, supported on the branches of trees, from which their roots\r\nhang freely down. Such orchids are sometimes spoken of as \"air-plants.\"\r\n\r\nAll the Angiosperms as yet mentioned, from the grasses to the orchids\r\ninclusively, belong to the lower of the two great groups or classes into\r\nwhich, as was lately said, the whole mass of Angiosperms is divided.\r\n\r\nThis great group is named _Monocotyledones_ (on account of the structure\r\nof the seed), and it is sometimes spoken of as _Endogens_, in reference\r\nto a generally prevalent habit of growth. The members of this whole\r\nclass will then hereinafter be spoken of as \"Monocotyledons.\"\r\n\r\nAll the plants which yet remain to be enumerated belong to the other and\r\nstill greater group of Angiosperms called (also in reference to their\r\nseeds) _Dicotyledons_, a group sometimes spoken of as \"_Exogens_,\" in\r\nreference to the habit of growth prevalent amongst its species.\r\n\r\nAll our familiar trees which are not conifers, and most of our flowering\r\nshrubs and herbs, are \"Dicotyledons.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the many orders which compose the Dicotyledonous group the few\r\nfollowing may be selected for enumeration, either on account of the\r\ngeneral interest they possess, or because they will have to be more or\r\nless referred to hereafter.\r\n\r\nWe may thus note the singular order of vegetable parasites, the\r\n_Loranthaceæ_, an order containing some thirty genera with four hundred\r\nspecies, and including the mistletoe, which is traditionally venerable\r\nin our island. The great group of catkin-bearing trees (_Amentaceæ_),\r\ncontains a great assemblage of plants, familiar in England, such as the\r\nhornbeam, hazel, oak, beech, Spanish chestnut, birch, willow, poplar,\r\n&c.[24]\r\n\r\nThe largest and one of the most remarkable flowers in the world,\r\n_Rafflesia_--a parasite found in Java and Sumatra by Sir Stamford\r\nRaffles--is the type of the small order _Rafflesiaceæ_. The eccentric\r\npitcher-bearing plants form the order _Nepenthaceæ_. The English herb\r\ncalled \"Spurge\" (with its milky juice), belongs to the order\r\n(_Euphorbiaceæ_), which is a large[25] cosmopolitan group, some species\r\nof the plants belonging to which attain, in hot countries, the size of\r\ntrees. Certain African species strangely resemble different kinds of\r\n_Cactus_. The elm order (_Ulmaceæ_) may come next. The hop, the hemp,\r\nthe mulberry, the fig, and the dorstenia are all nearly allied, the\r\nfirst two belonging to the order _Cannabinaceæ_, the last three to the\r\n_Moraceæ_. The bread-fruit of the South-Sea Islands belongs to the same\r\norder (_Artocarpaceæ_) as does the deadly upas-tree of Java. Garments\r\nmade of the inner bark of this plant are like the shirt of Nessus, and\r\nwill produce intolerable irritation; and even climbing the tree to\r\nobtain its flowers is said to have produced severe effects on the\r\nclimber. In proximity to the last-mentioned plant comes appropriately\r\n(as also in its proper botanical order) the group of stinging-nettles\r\n(_Urticaceæ_). The curious Australian plants which delighted the eyes of\r\nCaptain Cook's botanical companions belong to the order _Proteaceæ_.\r\nBesides these may be mentioned the dead-nettle order (_Labiatæ_); the\r\nbroom-rapes (_Orobanchaceæ_); the order of snap-dragons and foxgloves\r\n(_Scrophularineæ_); the potato group (_Solanaceæ_), which includes the\r\ndeadly nightshade and the dulcamara of our hedges; the parasitic order\r\n(_Cuscutaceæ_); the beautiful group of convolvuluses (_Convolvulaceæ_);\r\nthe gentians (_Gentianaceæ_); the primrose group (_Primulaceæ_); the\r\nheaths (_Ericaceæ_); the graceful hair-bell and its allies\r\n(_Campanulaceæ_); the very large group to which belong the daisy,\r\ndandelion, and thistle (_Compositæ_); the honeysuckle order\r\n(_Caprifoliaceæ_); the ivy (_Araliaceæ_); the large order containing the\r\nfennel, hemlock, and a multitude of other forms which, though mostly\r\nranking as herbs, attain gigantic dimensions in some species found in\r\nAfrica and Kamskatka (_Umbelliferæ_); the very singularly-shaped group\r\nof cactuses (_Cactaceæ_), with leafless fleshy stems, which sometimes\r\nlook like dry columns and sometimes are globular; the begonias\r\n(_Begoniaceæ_); the cucumbers, melons, and vegetable marrows\r\n(_Cucurbitaceæ_); the singularly-formed passion-flowers\r\n(_Passifloraceæ_); the myrtles (_Myrtaceæ_); the carnivorous group\r\ncontaining the sundew and Venus's flytrap (_Droseracæ_); the fleshy\r\nhouseleek and stonecrops (_Crassulaceæ_); the Saxifrages\r\n(_Saxifragaceæ_); the rose group (_Rosaceæ_), which includes within it\r\nmost of our fruits, such as the apple, pear, strawberry, cherry, peach,\r\nplum, almond, and others; the very large order which contains the peas,\r\nbeans, and their allies (_Leguminoseæ_); the horse-chestnut order\r\n(_Hippocastaneæ_); the maples (_Acerineæ_); the hollies (_Ilicineæ_);\r\nthe oranges and citrons (_Aurantiaceæ_); the cranesbills and\r\npelargoniums (_Geraniaceæ_); the flaxes (_Linaceæ_); the limes\r\n(_Tiliaceæ_), in which the useful jute is included; the mallows\r\n(_Malvaceæ_); the St. John's worts (_Hypericaceæ_); the order of pinks\r\n(_Caryophylleæ_); the pansies (_Violaceæ_); the rock-roses (_Cistaceæ_);\r\nthe mignonette group (_Resedaceæ_); the great wall-flower and cabbage\r\ngroup (_Cruciferæ_); the poppies (_Papaveraceæ_); the water-lilies\r\n(_Nymphaceæ_); the berberries (_Berberideæ_); the custard-apples\r\n(_Anonaceæ_); the magnolias (_Magnoliaceæ_); and, finally, the great\r\ngroup (_Ranunculaceæ_) containing the anemones, the clematis, hellebore,\r\nmonkshood, and the buttercup, which last is of great use to the student\r\nof Botany because it is an excellent type of all flowers.\r\n\r\nThe above may serve as a brief enumeration of the more generally known\r\nor more interesting orders of flowering plants, as also of the most\r\nnoteworthy forms of cryptogams. The much more numerous and complex\r\ngroups of animals have also been catalogued in the earlier and larger\r\npart of this Essay, which may thus, it is hoped, answer the purpose of\r\nan introduction to those multitudinous forms of organic life, the\r\nleading points in the structure and functions of which are hereafter to\r\noccupy us.\r\n\r\nThe main groups of Animals and Plants may be provisionally tabulated as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n                 { _Mammalia_ (Man and Beasts)\r\n  (1) VERTEBRATA { _Aves_ (Birds)\r\n  (Back-boned    { _Reptilia_ (Serpents, Crocodiles, Lizards, &c.)\r\n  Animals)       { _Batrachia_ (Frogs, Efts, &c.)\r\n                 { _Pisces_ (Fishes)\r\n\r\n                 { _Cephalopoda_ (Cuttle Fishes)\r\n  (2) MOLLUSCA   { _Pteropoda_\r\n  (Soft Animals) { _Gasteropoda_ (Snails, &c.)\r\n                 { _Lamellibranchiata_ (Oysters, &c.)\r\n                 { _Brachiopoda_ (Lamp-shells)\r\n\r\n  (3) TUNICATA     (Ascidians, Tunicaries, or Sea-squirts)\r\n\r\n  (4) ARTHROPODA { _Crustacea_ (Crabs, &c.)\r\n  (Animals with  { _Myriapoda_ (Hundred-legs, &c.)\r\n  jointed feet)  { _Arachnida_ (Scorpions, Spiders, &c.)\r\n                 { _Insecta_\r\n\r\n                 { _Annelida_ (Earth-worms, Leeches, &c.)\r\n                 { _Enteropneusta_ (Balanoglossus)\r\n                 { _Bryozoa_ (Sea-mat, &c.)\r\n                 { _Nematoidea_ (Thread-worms)\r\n  (5) VERMES     { _Trematoda_ (Flukes, &c.)\r\n                 { _Turbellaria_ (Planariæ, &c.)\r\n                 { _Cestoidea_ (Tape-worms)\r\n                 { _Rotifera_ (Wheel-animalcules)\r\n                 { _Gasterotricha_\r\n                 { _Gephyrea_ (Sipunculus, &c.)\r\n\r\n  (6) ECHINODERMA  (Star-fishes, &c.)\r\n\r\n                   { _Ctenophora_ (Beröe, &c.)\r\n  (7) COELENTERA   { _Actinozoa_ (Coral animals)\r\n                   { _Hydrozoa_ (Jelly-fishes, &c.)\r\n\r\n  (8) SPONGIDA     (Sponges)\r\n\r\n                 { _Infusoria_ (Animalcules with mouths)\r\n  (9) HYPOZOA    { _Gregarinida_\r\n                 { _Rhizopoda_ (Foraminifers, Radiolarians,\r\n                    Flagellata, &c.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  PLANTS.\r\n\r\n                   { _Algæ_ (Sea-weeds, Confervæ, &c.)\r\n                   { _Fungi_\r\n                   { _Lichenes_\r\n  (1) CRYPTOGAMIA  { _Hepaticæ_ (Liverworts and Scale-mosses)\r\n  (Flowerless      { _Characeæ_ (Nitella, &c.)\r\n  Plants)          { _Musci_ (Mosses)\r\n                   { _Marsiliaceæ_ (Pepperworts)\r\n                   { _Equisetaceæ_ (Horsetails)\r\n                   { _Filices_ (Ferns)\r\n\r\n  (2) PHANEROGAMIA { A. _Gymnosperms_ (Firs, Yews, Cycads, &c.)\r\n  (Flowering       {                  { _Monocotyledones_ (Grasses, Palms, Lilies,\r\n  Plants)          { B. _Angiosperms_ { Orchids, &c.)\r\n                   {                  { _Dicotyledones_ (the great mass of Flowering\r\n                   {                  { Plants and Trees).\r\n\r\n  ST.

There, among pagan sarcophagi\r\nturned into Christian tombs, with heraldic devices chiselled on to their\r\narabesques and vizored helmets surmounting their garlands, the great\r\nunsigned artist of the fourteenth century, be he Sienese or Florentine,\r\nbe he Orcagna, Lorenzetti, or Volterra, painted the typical masterpiece\r\nof mediæval art, the great fresco of the Triumph of Death. With\r\nwonderful realization of character and situation he painted the\r\nprosperous of the world, the dapper youths and damsels seated with dogs\r\nand falcons beneath the orchard trees, amusing themselves with\r\nDecameronian tales and sound of lute and psaltery, unconscious of the\r\ngigantic scythe wielded by the gigantic dishevelled Death, and which, in\r\na second, will descend and mow them to the ground; but the crowd of\r\nbeggars, ragged, maimed, paralyzed, leprous, grovelling on their\r\nwithered limbs, see and implore Death, and cry stretching forth their\r\narms, their stumps, and their crutches. Further on, three kings in long\r\nembroidered robes and gold-trimmed shovel caps, Lewis the Emperor,\r\nUguccione of Pisa, and Castruccio of Lucca, with their retinue of ladies\r\nand squires, and hounds and hawks, are riding quietly through a wood.\r\nSuddenly their horses stop, draw back; the Emperor's bay stretches out\r\nhis long neck sniffing the air; the kings strain forward to see, one\r\nholding his nose for the stench of death which meets him; and before\r\nthem are three open coffins, in which lie, in three loathsome stages of\r\ncorruption, from blue and bloated putrescence to well-nigh fleshless\r\ndecay, three crowned corpses. This is the triumph of Death; the grim and\r\nhorrible jest of the Middle Ages: equality in decay; kings, emperors,\r\nladies, knights, beggars, and cripples, this is what we all come to be,\r\nstinking corpses; Death, our lord, our only just and lasting sovereign,\r\nreigns impartially over all.\r\n\r\nBut opposite, all along the sides of the painted cloister, the amazons\r\nare wrestling with the youths on the stone of the sarcophagi; the\r\nchariots are dashing forward, the Tritons are splashing in the marble\r\nwaves; the Bacchantæ are striking their timbrels in their dance with the\r\nsatyrs; the birds are pecking at the grapes, the goats are nibbling at\r\nthe vines, all is life, strong and splendid in its marble eternity. And\r\nthe mutilated Venus smiles towards the broken Hermes; the stalwart\r\nHercules, resting against his club, looks on quietly, a smile beneath\r\nhis beard; and the gods murmur to each other, as they stand in the\r\ncloister filled with earth from Calvary, where hundreds of men lie\r\nrotting beneath the cypresses, \"Death will not triumph for ever; our day\r\nwill come.\"\r\n\r\nWe have all seen them opposite to each other, these two arts, the art\r\nborn of antiquity and the art born of the Middle Ages; but whether this\r\nmeeting was friendly or hostile or merely indifferent, is a question of\r\nconstant dispute. To some, mediæval art has appeared being led,\r\nDante-like, by a magician Virgil through the mysteries of Nature up to a\r\nChristian Beatrice, who alone can guide it to the kingdom of heaven;\r\nothers have seen mediæval art, like some strong, chaste knight turning\r\naway resolutely from the treacherous sorceress of antiquity, and\r\npursuing solitarily the road to the true and the good; for some the\r\nantique has been an impure goddess Venus, seducing and corrupting the\r\nChristian artist; the antique has been for others a glorious Helen, an\r\nunattainable perfection, ever pursued by the mediæval craftsman, but\r\nseized by him only as a phantom. Magician or witch, voluptuous,\r\ndestroying Venus or cold and ungrasped Helen, what was the antique to\r\nthe art born of the Middle Ages and developed during the Renaissance?\r\nWas the relation between them that of tuition, cool and abstract, or of\r\nfruitful lore, or of deluding and damning example?\r\n\r\nThe art which came to maturity in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth\r\ncenturies was generated in the early mediæval revival. The seeds may,\r\nindeed, have come down from antiquity, but they remained for nearly a\r\nthousand years hidden in the withered, rotting remains of former\r\nvegetation, and it was not till that vegetation had completely\r\ndecomposed and become part of the soil, it was not till putrefaction had\r\nturned into germination, that artistic organism timidly reappeared. The\r\nnew art-germ developed with the new civilization which surrounded it.\r\nManufacture and commerce reappeared: the artisans and merchants formed\r\ninto communities; the communities grew into towns, the towns into\r\ncities; in the city arose the cathedral; the Lombard or Byzantine\r\nmouldings and traceries of the cathedral gave birth to figure-sculpture;\r\nits mosaics gave birth to painting; every forward movement of the\r\ncivilization unfolded as it were a new form or detail of the art, until,\r\nwhen mediæval civilization was reaching its moment of consolidation,\r\nwhen the cathedrals of Lucca and Pisa stood completed, when Niccoto and\r\nGiovanni Pisani had sculptured their pulpits and sepulchres, painting,\r\nin the hands of, Cimabue and Duccio, of Giotto and of Guido da Siena,\r\nfreed itself from the tradition of the mosaicists as sculpture had freed\r\nitself from the practice of the stone-masons, and stood forth an\r\nindependent and organic art.\r\n\r\nThus painting was born of a new civilization, and grew by its own vital\r\nforce; a thing of the Middle Ages, original and spontaneous. But\r\ncontemporaneous with the mediæval revival was the resuscitation of\r\nantiquity; in proportion as the new civilization developed, the old\r\ncivilization was exhumed; real Latin began to be studied only when real\r\nItalian began to be written; Dante, Petrarca, and Boccaccio were at once\r\nthe founders of modern literature and the exponents of the literature of\r\nantiquity; the strong young present was to profit by the experience of\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nAs it was with literature, so likewise was it with art. The most purely\r\nmediæval sculpture, the sculpture which has, as it were, just detached\r\nitself from the capitals and porches of the cathedral, is the direct\r\npupil of the antique; and the three great Gothic sculptors, Niccoto,\r\nGiovanni, and Andrea of Pisa, learn from fragments of Greek and Roman\r\nsculpture how to model the figure of the Redeemer and how to chisel the\r\nrobe of the Virgin. This spontaneous mediæval sculpture, aided by the\r\nantique, preceded by a full half-century the appearance of mediæval\r\npainting; and it was from the study of the works of the Pisan sculptors,\r\nthat Cimabue and Giotto learned to depart from the mummified\r\nmonstrosities of the Miratic, Byzantine, and Roman style of Giunta and\r\nBerlinghieri. Thus, through the sculpture of the Pisans the painting of\r\nthe school of Giotto received at second-hand the teachings of antiquity.\r\nSculpture had created painting, painting now belonged to the painters.\r\nIn the hands of Giotto it developed within a few years into an art which\r\nseemed almost mature, an art dealing victoriously with its materials,\r\ntriumphantly solving its problems, executing as if by miracle all that\r\nwas demanded of it. But Giottesque art appeared perfect merely because\r\nit was limited; it did all that was required of it, because that which\r\nwas required was little; it was not asked to reproduce the real, nor to\r\nrepresent the beautiful, it was asked merely to suggest a character, a\r\nsituation, a story.\r\n\r\nThe artistic development of a nation has its exact parallel in the\r\nartistic development of an individual. The child uses his pencil to tell\r\na story, satisfied with balls and sticks as body, head, and legs,\r\nprovided he and his friends can associate with them the ideas in their\r\nminds: the youth sets himself to copy what he sees, to reproduce forms,\r\nand effects, without any aim beyond the mere pleasure of copying; the\r\nmature artist strives to obtain forms and effects of which he approves,\r\nhe seeks for beauty. In the life of Italian painting generations of men\r\nwho flourished at the beginning of the sixteenth century are the mature\r\nartists; the men of the fifteenth century are the inexperienced youths;\r\nthe Giottesques are the children--children Titanic and seraph-like, but\r\nchildren nevertheless, and, like all children, learning more perhaps in\r\ntheir few years than can the youth of the man learn in a lifetime.\r\n\r\nLike the child, the Giottesque painter wished to show a situation or\r\nexpress a story, and for this purpose the absolute realization of\r\nobjects was unnecessary. Giottesque art is not incorrect art, it is\r\ngeneralized art; it is an art of mere outline. The Giottesques could\r\ndraw with great accuracy the hand, the form of the fingers, the bend of\r\nthe limb, they could give to perfection its whole gesture and movement,\r\nthey could produce a correct and spirited outline, but within this\r\ncorrect outline marked off in dark paint there is but a vague, uniform\r\nmass of pale colour; the body of the hand is missing, and there remains\r\nonly its ghost, visible indeed, but unsubstantial, without weight or\r\nwarmth, eluding the grasp. The difference between this spectre hand of\r\nthe Giottesques, and the sinewy, muscular hand which can shake and crush\r\nof Masaccio and Signorelli, or the soft hand with throbbing pulse and\r\nwarm pressure of Perugino and Bellini,--this difference is typical of\r\nthe difference between the art of the fourteenth century and the art of\r\nthe fifteenth century; the first suggests, the second realizes; the one\r\ngives impalpable outlines, the other gives tangible bodies; the\r\nGiottesque cares for the figure only, inasmuch as it displays an action,\r\nhe reduces it to a semblance, a phantom, to the mere exponent of an\r\nidea; the man of the Renaissance cares for the figure, inasmuch as it is\r\na living organism, he gives it substance and weight, he makes it stand\r\nout as an animate reality. But despite its early triumphs, the\r\nGiottesque style, by its inherent nature, forbade any progress; it\r\nreached its limits at once, and the followers of Giotto look almost as\r\nif they were his predecessors, for the simple reason that, being unable\r\nto advance, they were forced to retrograde. The limited amount of\r\nartistic realization required to present to the mind of the spectator a\r\nsituation or an allegory had been obtained by Giotto himself, and\r\nbequeathed by him to his followers, who, finding it more than sufficient\r\nfor their purposes, and having no incentive to further acquisition in\r\nthe love of form and reality for their own sake, worked on with their\r\nmaster's materials, composing and recomposing, but adding nothing of\r\ntheir own. Giotto had observed Nature with passionate interest, because,\r\nalthough its representation was only a means to an end, it was a means\r\nwhich required to be mastered, and as such became in itself a sort of\r\nsecondary aim; but the followers of Giotto merely utilized his\r\nobservations of Nature, and in so doing gradually conventionalized and\r\ndebased these second-hand observations. Giotto's forms are wilfully\r\nincomplete, because they aim at mere suggestion, but they are not\r\nconventional: they are diagrams, not symbols, and thence it is that\r\nGiotto seems nearer to the Renaissance than do his latest followers, not\r\nexcepting even Orcagna. Painting, which had made the most prodigious\r\nstrides from Giunta to Cimabue, and from Cimabue to Giotto, had got\r\nenclosed within a vicious circle, in which it moved for nearly a century\r\nneither backwards nor forwards: painters were satisfied with suggestion;\r\nand as long as they were satisfied, no progress was possible.\r\n\r\nFrom this Giottesque treadmill, painting was released by the\r\nintervention of another art. The painters were hopelessly mediocre;\r\ntheir art was snatched from them by the sculptors. Orcagna himself,\r\nperhaps the only Giottesque who gave painting an onward push, had\r\nmodelled and cast one of the bronze gates of the Florence baptistery;\r\nthe generation of artists who arose at the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and who opened the period of the Renaissance, were sculptors or\r\npupils of sculptors. When we see these vigorous lovers of Nature, these\r\nheroic searchers after truth, suddenly pushing aside the decrepit\r\nGiottesque allegory-mongers, we ask ourselves in astonishment whence\r\nthey have arisen, and how those broken-down artists of effete art could\r\nhave begotten such a generation of giants. Whence do they come?\r\nCertainly not from the studios of the Giottesques; no, they issue out of\r\nthe workshops of the stone-mason, of the goldsmith, of the worker in\r\nbronze, of the sculptor. Vasari has preserved the tradition that\r\nMasolino and Paolo Uccello were apprentices of Ghiberti; he has remarked\r\nthat their greatest contemporary, Masaccio, \"trod in the steps of\r\nBrunelleschi and of Donatello.\" Pollaiolo and Verrocchio we know to have\r\nbeen equally excellent as painters and as workers in bronze; sculpture,\r\nat once more naturalistic and more constantly under the influence of the\r\nantique, had for the second time laboured for painting. Itself a\r\nsubordinate art, without real vitality, without deep roots in the\r\ncivilization, sculpture was destined to remain the unsuccessful pupil of\r\nthe antique, and the unsuccessful rival of painting; but sculpture had\r\nfor its mission to prepare the road for painting and to prepare painting\r\nfor antique influence, and the noblest work of Ghiberti and Donatello\r\nwas Masaccio, as the most lasting glory to the Pisani had been Giotto.\r\n\r\nWith Masaccio began the study of Nature for its own sake, the desire of\r\nreproducing external objects without any regard to their significance as\r\nsymbols or as parts of a story, the passionate wish to arrive at\r\nabsolute realization. The merely suggestive outline art of the\r\nGiottesques had come to an end; the suggestion became a matter of\r\nindifference; the realization became a paramount interest; the story was\r\nforgotten in the telling, the religious thought was lost in the search\r\nfor the artistic form. The Giottesques had used debased conventionalism\r\nto represent action with wonderful narrative and logical power; the\r\nartists of the early Renaissance became unskilful narrators and foolish\r\nallegorists almost in proportion as they became skilful draughtsmen and\r\ncolourists; the Saints had become to Masaccio merely so many lay\r\nfigures on to which to cast drapery; for Fra Filippo, the Madonna was a\r\nmere peasant model; for Filippino Lippi and for Ghirlandajo, a miracle\r\nmeant merely an opportunity of congregating a number of admirable\r\nportrait figures in the dress of the day; the Baptism for Verrocchio had\r\nsignificance only as a study of muscular legs and arms; and the\r\nsacrifice of Noah had no importance for Uccello save as a grand\r\nopportunity for foreshortenings. In the hands of the Giottesques,\r\ninterested in the subject and indifferent to the representation,\r\npainting had remained stationary for eighty years; for eighty years did\r\nit develop in the hands of the men of the fifteenth century, indifferent\r\nto the subject and passionately interested in the representation. The\r\nunity, the appearance of relative perfection of the art had disappeared\r\nwith the limits within which the Giottesques had been satisfied to move;\r\ninstead of the intelligible and solemn conventionalism of the\r\nGiottesques, we see only disorder, half-understood ideas and abortive\r\nattempts, confusion which reminds us of those enigmatic sheets on which\r\nLeonardo or Michel Angelo scrawled out their ideas, drawings within\r\ndrawings, plans of buildings scratched over Madonna heads, single\r\nflowers upside down next to flayed arms, calculations, monsters,\r\nsonnets, a very chaos of thoughts and of shapes, in which the plan of\r\nthe artist is inextricably lost, which mean everything and nothing, but\r\nout of whose unintelligible network of lines and curves have issued\r\nmasterpieces, and which only the foolish or the would-be philosophical\r\nwould exchange for some intelligible, hopelessly finished and finite\r\nillustration out of a Bible or a book of travels.\r\n\r\nAnatomy, perspective, colour, drapery, effects of light, of water, of\r\nshadow, forms of trees and flowers, converging lines of architecture,\r\nall this at once absorbed and distracted the attention of the artists of\r\nthe early Renaissance; and while they studied, copied, and calculated,\r\nanother thought began to haunt them, another eager desire began to\r\npursue them: by the side of Nature, the manifold, the baffling, the\r\nbewildering, there rose up before them another divinity, another sphinx,\r\nmysterious in its very simplicity and serenity--the antique.\r\n\r\nThe exhumation of the antique had, as we have seen, been contemporaneous\r\nwith the birth of painting; nay, the study of the remains of antique\r\nsculpture had, in contributing to form Niccoto Pisano, indirectly helped\r\nto form Giotto; the very painter of the \"Triumph of Death\" had inserted\r\ninto his terrible fresco two-winged genii, upholding a scroll, copied\r\nwithout any alteration from some coarse Roman sarcophagus, in which they\r\nmay have sustained the usual _Dis Manibus Sacrum_. There had been, on\r\nthe part of both sculptors and painters, a constant study of the\r\nantique; but during the Giottesque period this study had been limited to\r\ntechnicalities, and had in no way affected the conception of art. The\r\nmediæval artists, surrounded by physical deformities, and seeing\r\nsanctity in sickness and dirt, little accustomed to observe the human\r\nfigure, were incapable, both as men and as artists, of at all entering\r\ninto the spirit of antique art. They could not perceive the superior\r\nbeauty of the antique; they could recognize only its superior science\r\nand its superior handicraft, and these they studied to obtain.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Pisano, sculpturing the unfleshed, carved carcases of the\r\ndevils who leer, writhe, crunch, and tear on the outside of Orvieto\r\nCathedral, and the Giottesques painting those terrible green, macerated\r\nChrists, hanging livid and broken from the cross, which abound in\r\nTuscany and Umbria, the artists who produced these loathsome and\r\nlugubrious works were indubitably students of the antique; but they had\r\nlearned from it not a love for beautiful form and noble drapery, but\r\nmerely the general shape of the limbs and the general fall of the\r\ngarments; the anatomical science and technical processes of antiquity\r\nwere being used to produce the most intensely un-antique, the most\r\nintensely mediæval works. Thus matters stood in the time of Giotto. His\r\nfollowers, who studied only arrangement, probably consulted the antique\r\nas little as they consulted Nature; but the contemporary sculptors were\r\nbrought by the very constitution of their art into close contact both\r\nwith Nature and with the antique; they studied both with determination,\r\nand handed over the results of their labours to the sculptor-taught\r\npainters of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nHere, then, were the two great factors in the art of the\r\nRenaissance--the study of Nature, and the study of the antique; both\r\nunderstood slowly, imperfectly; the one counteracting the effect of the\r\nother; the study of Nature now scaring away all antique influence; the\r\nstudy of the antique now distorting all imitation of Nature; rival\r\nforces confusing the artist and marring the work, until, when each could\r\nreceive its due, the one corrected the other, and they combined,\r\nproducing by this marriage of the living reality with the dead but\r\nimmortal beauty, the great art of Michel Angelo, of Raphael, and of\r\nTitian: double like its origin, antique and modern, real and ideal.\r\n\r\nThe study of the antique is thus placed opposite to the study of Nature,\r\nthe comprehension of the works of antiquity is the momentary antagonist\r\nof the comprehension of Nature. And this may seem strange, when we\r\nconsider that antique art was itself due to perfect comprehension of\r\nNature. But the contradiction is easily explained. The study of Nature,\r\nas it was carried on in the Renaissance, comprised the study of effects\r\nwhich had remained unnoticed by antiquity; and the study of the statue,\r\ncolourless, without light, shade, or perspective, interfered with, and\r\nwas interfered with by, the study of colour, of light and shade, of\r\nperspective, and of all that a generation of painters would seek to\r\nlearn from Nature. Nor was this all; the influence of the civilization\r\nof the Renaissance, of a civilization directly issued from the Middle\r\nAges, was entirely at variance with the influence of antique\r\ncivilization through the medium of ancient art; the Middle Ages and\r\nantiquity, Christianity and Paganism, were even more opposed to each\r\nother than could be the statue and the easel picture, the fresco and\r\nthe bas-relief.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, we have the hostility between painting and sculpture,\r\nbetween the _modus operandi_ of the modern and the _modus operandi_ of\r\nthe ancient art. Antique art is in the first place purely linear art,\r\ncolourless, tintless, without light and shade; next, it is essentially\r\nthe art of the isolated figure, without background, grouping, or\r\nperspective. As linear art it could directly affect only that branch of\r\npainting which was itself linear, and as art of the isolated figure it\r\nwas ever being contradicted by the constantly developing arts of\r\nperspective and landscape. The antique never directly influenced the\r\nVenetians, not from reasons of geography and culture, but from the fact\r\nthat Venetian painting, founded from the earliest times upon a system of\r\ncolour, could not be affected by antique sculpture, based upon a system\r\nof modelled, colourless forms; the men who saw form only through the\r\nmedium of colour could not learn much from purely linear form; hence it\r\nis that even after a certain amount of antique imitation had passed into\r\nVenetian painting, through the medium of Mantegna, the Venetian painters\r\ndisplay comparatively little antique influence. In Bellini, Carpaccio,\r\nCima, and other early masters, the features, forms, and dress are mainly\r\nmodern and Venetian; and Giorgione, Titian, and even the eclectic\r\nTintoret were more interested in the bright lights of a steel\r\nbreastplate than in the shape of a limb, and preferred in their hearts a\r\nshot brocade of the sixteenth century to the finest drapery modelled by\r\nan ancient.\r\n\r\nThe antique influence was naturally strongest among the Tuscan schools;\r\nbecause the Tuscan schools were essentially schools of drawing, and the\r\ndraughtsman only recognized in antique sculpture the highest perfection\r\nof that linear form which was his own domain. The antique not only\r\nappealed most to the linear schools, but even in them it could strongly\r\ninfluence only the purely linear part; it is strong in the drawings and\r\nweak in the paintings. As long as the artists had only the pencil or\r\npen, they could reproduce much of the linear perfection of the antique;\r\nthey were, so to speak, alone with it; but as soon as they brought in\r\ncolour, perspective, and scenery, the linear perfection was lost in\r\nattempts at something new; the antique was put to flight by the modern.\r\nBotticelli's crayon study for his Venus is almost antique, his tempera\r\npicture of Venus, with the pale blue scaly sea, the laurel grove, the\r\nflower-embroidered garments, the wisps of tawny hair, is comparatively\r\nmediæval; Pinturricchio's sketch of fauns and satyrs contrasts strangely\r\nwith his frescos in the library of Silena; Mantegna himself,\r\nsupernaturally antique in his engravings, becomes almost trivial and\r\nmodern in his oil paintings. Do what they might, draw from the antique,\r\ncalculate its proportions, the artists of the Renaissance found\r\nthemselves baffled as soon as they attempted to apply the result of\r\ntheir linear studies to coloured pictures; as soon as they tried to\r\nmake the antique unite with the modern, one of the two elements was sure\r\nto succumb. In Botticelli, draughtsman and student though he was, the\r\nmodern, the mediæval, that part of the art which had arisen in the\r\nMiddle Ages, invariably had the upper hand; his Venus has, despite her\r\nforms studied from the antique and her gesture imitated from some\r\nearlier discovered copy of the Medicean Venus, the woe-begone prudery of\r\na Madonna or of an abbess; she shivers physically and morally in her\r\nunaccustomed nakedness, and the goddess of Spring, who comes skipping up\r\nfrom beneath the laurel copse, does well to prepare her a mantle, for in\r\nthe paled tempera colour, against the dismal background of rippled sea,\r\nthis mediæval Venus, at once indecent and prudish, is no pleasing sight.\r\nIn the Allegory of Spring in the Academy of Florence, we again have the\r\nantique; goddesses and nymphs whose clinging garments the gentle Sandro\r\nBotticelli has assuredly studied from some old statue of Agrippina or\r\nFaustina; but what strange livid tints are there beneath those\r\ndraperies, what eccentric gestures are those of the nymphs, what a\r\ngreen, ghostlike light illumines the garden of Venus! Are these\r\ngoddesses and nymphs immortal women such as the ancients conceived, or\r\nare they not rather fantastic fairies or nixen, Titanias and Undines,\r\nincorporeal daughters of dew and gossamer and mist?\r\n\r\nIn Sandro Botticelli the teachings of the statue are forgotten or\r\ndistorted when the artist takes up his palette and brushes; in his far\r\ngreater contemporary, Andrea Mantegna, the ever-present antique chills\r\nand arrests the vitality of the modern. Mantegna, the pupil of the\r\nancient marbles of Squarcione's workshop even more than the pupil of\r\nDonatello, studies for his paintings not from Nature, but from\r\nsculpture; his figures are seen in strange projection and\r\nforeshortening, like figures in a high relief seen from below; despite\r\nhis mastery of perspective, they seem hewn out of the background;\r\ndespite the rich colours which he displays in his Veronese altar-piece,\r\nthey look like painted marbles, with their hard clots of stone-like hair\r\nand beard, with their vacant glance and their wonderful draperies,\r\nclinging and weighty like the wet draperies of ancient sculpture. They\r\nare beautiful petrifactions, or vivified statues; Mantegna's\r\nmasterpiece, the sepia \"Judith\" in Florence, is like an exquisite,\r\npathetically lovely Eurydice, who has stepped unconscious and lifeless\r\nout of a Praxitelian bas-relief. And there are stranger works than even\r\nthe Judith; strange statuesque fancies, like the fight of Marine\r\nMonsters and the Bacchanal among Mantegna's engravings. The group of\r\nthree wondrous creatures, at once men, fish, and gods, is as grand and\r\neven more fantastic than Leonardo's Battle of the Standard: a Triton,\r\nsturdy and muscular, with sea-weed beard and hair, wheels round his\r\nfinned horse, preparing to strike his adversary with a bunch of fish\r\nwhich he brandishes above him; on him is rushing, careering on an\r\nosseous sea-horse, a strange, lank, sinewy being, fury stretching every\r\ntendon, his long clawed feet striking into the flanks of his steed, his\r\nsharp, reed-crowned head turned fiercely, with clenched teeth, on his\r\nopponent, and stretching forth a truncheon, ready to run down his enemy\r\nas a ship runs down another; and further off a young Triton, with\r\nclotted hair and heavy eyes, seems ready to sink wounded below the\r\nrippling wavelets, with the massive head and marble agony of the dying\r\nAlexander; enigmatic figures, grand and grotesque, lean, haggard,\r\nvehement, and yet, in the midst of violence and monstrosity,\r\nunaccountably antique. The other print, called the Bacchanal, has no\r\nbackground: half-a-dozen male figures stand separate and naked as in a\r\nbas-relief. Some are leaning against a vine-wreathed tub; a satyr, with\r\nacanthus-leaves growing wondrously out of him, half man, half plant, is\r\nemptying a cup; a heavy Silenus is prone upon the ground; a faun, seated\r\nupon the vat, is supporting in his arms a beautiful sinking youth;\r\nanother youth, grand, muscular and grave as a statue, stands on the\r\nfurther side. Is this really a bacchanal? Yes, for there is the paunchy\r\nSilenus, there are the fauns, there the vat and vine-wreaths and\r\ndrinking-horns. And yet it cannot be a bacchanal. Compare with it one of\r\nRubens's orgies, where the overgrown, rubicund men and women and fauns\r\ntumble about in tumultuous, riotous intoxication: that is a bacchanal;\r\nthey have been drinking, those magnificent brutes, there is wine firing\r\ntheir blood and weighing down their heads. But here all is different, in\r\nthis so-called Bacchanal of Mantegna. This heavy Silenus is supine like\r\na mass of marble; these fauns are shy and mute; these youths are grave\r\nand sombre; there is no wine in the cups, there are no lees in the vat,\r\nthere is no life in these magnificent colossal forms; there is no blood\r\nin their grandly bent lips, no light in their wide-opened eyes; it is\r\nnot the drowsiness of intoxication which is weighing down the youth\r\nsustained by the faun; it is no grape-juice, which gives that strange,\r\nvague glance. No; they have drunk, but not of any mortal drink; the\r\ngrapes are grown in Persephone's garden, the vat contains no fruits that\r\nhave ripened beneath our sun. These strange, mute, solemn revellers have\r\ndrunk of Lethe, and they are growing cold with the cold of death and of\r\nmarble; they are the ghosts of the dead ones of antiquity, revisiting\r\nthe artist of the Renaissance, who paints them, thinking he is painting\r\nlife, while that which he paints is in reality death.\r\n\r\nThis anomaly, this unsatisfactory character of the works of both\r\nBotticelli and Mantegna, is mainly technical; the antique is frustrated\r\nin Botticelli, not so much by the Christian, the mediæval, the modern\r\nmode of feeling, as by the new methods and aims of the new art which\r\ndisconcert the methods and aims of the old art; and that which arrests\r\nMantegna in his development as a painter is not the spirit of paganism\r\ndeadening the spirit of Christianity, but the laws of sculpture\r\nhampering painting. But this technical contest between two arts, the one\r\nnot yet fully developed, the other not yet fully understood, is as\r\nnothing compared with the contest between the two civilizations, the\r\nantique and the modern; between the habits and tendencies of the\r\ncontemporaries of the artists of the Renaissance and of the artists\r\nthemselves, and the habits and tendencies of the antique artists and\r\ntheir contemporaries. We are apt to think of the Renaissance as of a\r\nperiod closely resembling antiquity, misled by the inevitable similarity\r\nbetween southern and democratic countries of whatever age; misled still\r\nless pardonably by the Ciceronian pedantries and pseudo-antique\r\nobscurities of a few humanists, and by the pseudo-Corinthian arabesques\r\nand capitals of a few learned architects. But all this was mere\r\narchæological finery borrowed by a civilization in itself entirely\r\nunlike that of ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance, let us remember, was merely the flowering time of that\r\ngreat mediæval movement which had germinated early in the twelfth\r\ncentury; it was merely a more advanced stage of the civilization which\r\nhad produced Dante and Giotto, of the civilization which was destined to\r\nproduce Luther and Rabelais. The fifteenth century was merely the\r\ncontinuation of the fourteenth century, as the fourteenth had been of\r\nthe thirteenth; there had been growth and improvement; development of\r\nthe more modern, diminishing of the more mediæval elements; but, despite\r\ngrowth and the changes due to growth, the Renaissance was part and\r\nparcel of the Middle Ages. The life, thought, aspirations, and habits\r\nwere mediæval, opposed to the open-air life, the physical training, and\r\nthe materialistic religion of antiquity. The surroundings of Masaccio\r\nand of Signorelli, nay, even of Raphael, were very different from those\r\nof Phidias or Praxiteles. Let us think what were the daily and hourly\r\nimpressions given by the Renaissance to its artists. Large towns, in\r\nwhich thousands of human beings were crowded together, in narrow, gloomy\r\nstreets, with but a strip of blue visible between the projecting roofs;\r\nand in these cities an incessant commercial activity, with no relief\r\nsave festivals at the churches, brawls at the taverns, and carnival\r\nbuffooneries. Men and women pale and meagre for want of air, and light,\r\nand movement; undeveloped, untrained bodies, warped by constant work at\r\nthe loom or at the desk, at best with the lumpish freedom of the soldier\r\nand the vulgar nimbleness of the 'prentice. And these men and women\r\ndressed in the dress of the Middle Ages, gorgeous perhaps in colour, but\r\nheavy, miserable, grotesque, nay, sometimes ludicrous in form; citizens\r\nin lumpish robes and long-tailed caps; ladies in stiff and foldless\r\nbrocade hoops and stomachers; artisans in striped and close-adhering\r\nhose and egg-shaped padded jerkin; soldiers in lumbering armour-plates,\r\nill-fitted over ill-fitting leather, a shapeless shell of iron, bulging\r\nout and angular, in which the body was buried as successfully as in the\r\nrobes of the magistrates. Thus we see the men and women of the\r\nRenaissance in the works of all its painters; heavy in Ghirlandajo,\r\nvulgarly jaunty in Fillipino, preposterously starched and prim in\r\nMantegna, ludicrously undignified in Signorelli; and mediæval stiffness,\r\nawkwardness, and absurdity reach their acme perhaps in the little boys,\r\ncompanions of the Medici children, introduced into Benozzo Gozzoli's\r\nBuilding of Babel.\r\n\r\nThese are the prosperous townsfolk, among whom the Renaissance artist\r\nis but too glad to seek for models; but besides these there are\r\nlamentable sights, mediæval beyond words, at every street corner--dwarfs\r\nand cripples, maimed and diseased beggars of all degrees of\r\nloathsomeness, lepers and epileptics, and infinite numbers of monks,\r\nbrown, grey and black, in sack-shaped frocks and pointed hoods, with\r\nshaven crown and cropped beard, emaciated with penance or bloated with\r\ngluttony. And all this the painter sees, daily, hourly; it is his\r\nstandard of humanity, and as such finds its way into every picture. It\r\nis the living; but opposite it arises the dead. Let us turn aside from\r\nthe crowd of the mediæval city, and look at what the workmen have just\r\nlaid bare, or what the merchant has just brought from Rome or from\r\nGreece. Look at this: it is corroded by oxides, battered by ill-usage,\r\nstained with earth: it is not a group, not even a whole statue, it has\r\nneither head nor arms remaining; it is a mere broken fragment of antique\r\nsculpture,--a naked body with a fold or two of drapery; it is not by\r\nPhidias nor by Praxiteles, it may not even be Greek; it may be some\r\ncheap copy, made for a garden or a bath, in the days of Hadrian. But to\r\nthe artist of the fifteenth century it is the revelation of a whole\r\nworld, a world in itself. We can scarcely realize all this; but let us\r\nlook and reflect, and even we may feel as must have felt the man of the\r\nRenaissance in the presence of that mutilated, stained, battered torso.\r\nHe sees in that broken stump a grandeur of outline, a magnificence of\r\nosseous structure, a breadth of muscle and sinew, a smooth, firm\r\ncovering of flesh, such as he would vainly seek in any of his living\r\nmodels; he sees a delicate and infinite variety of indentures, of\r\nprojections, of creases following the bend of every limb; he sees, where\r\nthe surface still exists intact, an elasticity of skin, a buoyancy of\r\nhidden life such as all the colours of his palette are unable to\r\nimitate; and in this piece of drapery, negligently gathered over the\r\nhips or robed upon the arm, he sees a magnificent alternation of large\r\nfolds and small creases, of straight lines, and broken lines, and\r\ncurves. He sees all this; but he sees more: the broken torso is, as we\r\nhave said, not merely a world in itself, but the revelation of a world.\r\n\r\nIt is the revelation of antique civilization, of the palæstra and the\r\nstadium, of the sanctification of the body, of the apotheosis of man, of\r\nthe religion of life and nature and joy; revealed to the man of the\r\nMiddle Ages, who has hitherto seen in the untrained, diseased, despised\r\nbody but a deformed piece of baseness, which his priests tell him\r\nbelongs to the worms and to Satan; who has been taught that the monk\r\nliving in solitude and celibacy, filthy, sick, worn out with fastings\r\nand bleeding with flagellation, is the nearest approach to divinity; who\r\nhas seen Divinity itself, pale, emaciated, joyless, hanging bleeding\r\nfrom the cross; and who is for ever reminded that the kingdom of this\r\nDivinity is not of this world.\r\n\r\nWhat passes in the mind of that artist? What surprise, what dawning\r\ndoubts, what sickening fears, what longings and what remorse are not\r\nthe fruit of this sight of antiquity? Is he to yield or to resist? Is he\r\nto forget the saints and Christ and give himself over to Satan and to\r\nantiquity? Only one man boldly said Yes. Mantegna abjured his faith,\r\nabjured the Middle Ages, abjured all that belonged to his time, and in\r\nso doing cast away from him the living art and became the lover, the\r\nworshipper of shadows. And only one man turned completely aside from the\r\nantique as from the demon, and that man was a saint, Fra Angelico da\r\nFiesoli. And with the antique, Fra Angelico rejected all the other\r\nartistic influences and aims of his time, the time not of Giotto or of\r\nOrcagna, but of Masaccio, of Uccello, of Poliaiolo and Donatitis. For\r\nthe mild, meek, angelic monk dreaded the life of his days; dreaded to\r\nleave the cloister where the sunshine was tempered and the noise reduced\r\nto a mere faint hum, and where the flower-beds were tidy and prim;\r\ndreaded to soil or rumple his spotless white robe and his shining black\r\ncowl; a spiritual sybarite, shrinking from the sight of the crowd\r\nseething in the streets, shrinking from the idea of stripping the rags\r\noff the beggar in order to see his tanned and gnarled limbs; shuddering\r\nat the thought of seeking for muscles in the dead, cut-open body;\r\nfearful of every whiff of life that might mingle with the incense\r\natmosphere of his chapel, of every cry of human passion which might\r\nbreak through the well-ordered sweetness of his chants. No; the\r\nRenaissance did not exist for him who lived in a world of diaphanous\r\nform, colour, and character; unsubstantial and unruffled, dreaming\r\nfeebly and sweetly of transparent-cheeked Madonnas with no limbs beneath\r\ntheir robes; of smooth-faced saints with well-combed beard and placid,\r\nvacant gaze, seated in well-ordered masses, holy with the purity of\r\ninanity; of divine dolls with pallid flaxen locks, floating between\r\nheaven and earth, playing upon lute and viol and psaltery; raised to\r\nfaint visions of angels and blessed, moving noiseless, feelingless,\r\nmeaningless, across the flowerets of Paradise; of assemblies of saints\r\nseated, arrayed in pure pink, and blue and lilac, in an atmosphere of\r\nliquid gold, in glory. And thus Fra Angelico worked on, content with the\r\ndearly-purchased science of his masters, placid, beatic, effeminate, in\r\nan æsthetical paradise of his own, a paradise of sloth and sweetness, a\r\nparadise for weak souls, weak hearts, and weak eyes; patiently repeating\r\nthe same fleshless angels, the same boneless saints, the same bloodless\r\nvirgins; happy in smoothing the unmixed, unshaded tints of the sky, and\r\nearth, and dresses; laying on the gold of the fretted skies, and of the\r\niridescent wings, embroidering robes, instruments of music, haloes,\r\nflowers, with threads of gold.... Sweet, simple artist saint, reducing\r\nart to something akin to the delicate pearl and silk embroidery of pious\r\nnuns, to the exquisite sweetmeat cookery of pious monks; a something too\r\ndelicately gorgeous, too deliciously insipid for human wear or human\r\nfood; no, the Renaissance does not exist for thee, either in its study\r\nof the truly existing, or in its study of antique beauty.\r\n\r\nMantegna, the learned, the archæological, the pagan, who renounces his\r\ntimes and his faith; and Angelico, the monk, the saint, who shuts and\r\nbolts his monastery doors and sprinkles holy water in the face of the\r\nantique, the two extremes, are both exceptions. The innumerable artists\r\nof the Renaissance remained in hesitation; tried to court both the\r\nantique and the modern, to unite the pagan and the Christian--some, like\r\nGhirlandajo, in cold indifference to all but mere form, encrusting\r\nmarble bacchanals into the walls of the Virgin's paternal house,\r\nbringing together, unthinkingly, antique-draped women carrying baskets\r\nand noble Stroggi and Ruccellai ladies with gloved hands folded over\r\ntheir gold brocaded skirts; others, with cheerful and child-like\r\npleasure in both antique and modern, like Benozzo, crowding together\r\nhalf-naked youths and nymphs treading the grapes and scaling the\r\ntrellise with Florentine magnificos in plaited skirts and starched\r\ncollars, among the pines and porticos, the sprawling children, barking\r\ndogs, peacocks sunning themselves, and partridges picking up grain, of\r\nhis Scripture histories; yet others using the antique as mere pageant\r\nshows, allegorical mummeries destined to amuse some Duke of Ferrara or\r\nMarquis of Mantua, together with hurdle races of Jews, hags, and\r\nriderless donkeys.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the antique amalgamates with the modern; the art born\r\nof the Middle Ages absorbs the art born of paganism; but how slowly, and\r\nwith what fantastic and ludicrous results at first; as when the\r\nanatomical sculptor Pollaiolo gives scenes of naked Roman prize-fighters\r\nas martyrdoms of St. Sebastian; or when the pious Perugino (pious at\r\nleast with his brush) dresses up his sleek, hectic, beardless archangels\r\nas Roman warriors, and makes them stand, straddling beatically on thin\r\nlittle dapper legs, wistfully gazing from beneath their wondrously\r\nornamented helmets on the walls of the Cambio at Perugia; when he\r\nmasquerades meditative fathers of the Church as Socrates and haggard\r\nanchorites as Numa Pompilius; most ludicrous of all, when he attires in\r\nscantiest of clinging antique drapery his mild and pensive Madonnas,\r\nand, with daintily-pointed toes, places them to throne bashfully on\r\nallegorical chariots as Venus or Diana.\r\n\r\nLong is the period of amalgamation, and little are the results\r\nthroughout that long early Renaissance. Mantegna, Piero della Francesca,\r\nMelozzo, Ghirlandajo, Filippino, Botticelli, Verrocchio, have none of\r\nthem shown us the perfect fusion of the two elements whose union is to\r\ngive us Michel Angelo, Raphael, and all the great perfect artists of the\r\nearly sixteenth century; the two elements are for ever ill-combined and\r\nhostile to each other; the modern vulgarizes the antique, the antique\r\nparalyzes the modern. And meanwhile the fifteenth century, the century\r\nof study, of conflict, and of confusion, is rapidly drawing to a close;\r\neight or ten more years, and it will be gone. Is the new century to find\r\nthe antique still dead and the modern still mediæval?\r\n\r\nThe antique and the modern had met for the first time and as\r\nirreconcileable enemies in the cloisters of Pisa; and the modern had\r\ntriumphed in the great mediæval fresco of the Triumph of Death. By a\r\nstrange coincidence, by a sublime jest of accident, the antique and the\r\nmodern were destined to meet again, and this time indissolubly united,\r\nin a painting representing the Resurrection. Yes, Signorelli's fresco in\r\nOrvieto Cathedral is indeed a resurrection, the resurrection of human\r\nbeauty after the long death-slumber of the Middle Ages. And the artist\r\nwould seem to have been dimly conscious of the great allegory he was\r\npainting. Here and there are strewn skulls; skeletons stand leering by,\r\nas if in remembrance of the ghastly past, and as a token of former\r\ndeath; but magnificent youths are breaking through the crust of the\r\nearth, emerging, taking shape and flesh; arising, strong and proud,\r\nready to go forth at the bidding of the Titanic angels who announce from\r\non high with trumpet sound and waving banners that the death of the\r\nworld has come to an end, and that humanity has arisen once more in the\r\nyouth and beauty of antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nSignorelli's fresceos at Orvieto, at once the latest works of the\r\nfifteenth century, and the latest works of an old man nurtured in the\r\ntraditions of Benozzo Gozzoli and of Piero della Francesca, mark the\r\nbeginning of the maturity and perfection of Italian art. From them\r\nMichel Angelo learns what he could not be taught even by his master\r\nGhirlandajo, the grand and cold realist; he learns, and what he has\r\nlearned at Orvieto he teaches with doubled force in Rome; and the\r\nceiling of the Sixtine Chapel, the superb and heroic nudities, the\r\nmajestic draperies, the reappearance in the modern art of painting of\r\nthe spirit and hand of Phidias, give a new impulse and hasten on\r\nperfection. When the doors of the chapel are at length opened, Raphael\r\nforgets Perugino; Fra Bartolomeo forgets Botticelli; Sodoma forgets\r\nLeonardo; the narrower hesitating styles of the fifteenth century are\r\nabandoned, as the great example is disseminated throughout Italy; and\r\neven the tumult of angels in glory which the Lombard Correggio is to\r\npaint in far-off Parma, and the daringly simple Bacchus and Ariadne with\r\nwhich Tintoret will decorate the Ducal palace more than fifty years\r\nlater, all that is great and bold, all that is a re-incarnation of the\r\nspirit of antiquity, all that marks the culmination of Renaissance art,\r\nseems due to the impulse of Michel Angelo, and, through him, to the\r\nexample of Signorelli. From the celestial horseman and bounding avenging\r\nangels of Raphael's Heliodorus, to the St. Sebastian of Sodoma, with\r\ndelicate limbs and exquisite head, rich with tendril-like locks against\r\nthe brown Umbrian sunset; from the Madonna of Andrea del Sarto seated,\r\nwith the head and drapery of a Niobe, on the sack of flour in the\r\nAnnunziata cloister, to the voluptuous goddess, with purple mantle half\r\nconcealing her body of golden white, who leans against the sculptured\r\nfountain in Titian's \"Sacred and Profane Love,\" with the greenish blue\r\nsky and hazy light of evening behind her; from the most extreme\r\nexamples of the most extreme schools of Lombardy and Venetia, to the\r\nmost intense examples of the remotest schools of Tuscany and Umbria,\r\nthroughout the art of the early sixteenth century, of those thirty years\r\nwhich were the years of perfection, we see, more or less marked, but\r\nalways distinct, the union of the living art born of the Middle Ages\r\nwith the dead art left by antiquity, a union producing life and\r\nperfection, the great art of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nThis much is clear and easy of definition; but what is neither clearly\r\nunderstood nor clearly defined is the nature of this union, the manner\r\nin which the antique and the modern did thus amalgamate. It is easy to\r\nspeak of a vague union of spirit, of the antique idea having permeated\r\nthe modern; but all this explains but little; art is not a metaphysical\r\nfigment, and all its phases and revolutions are concrete, and, so to\r\nspeak, physically explicable and definable. The union of the antique\r\nwith the modern meant simply the absorption by the art of the\r\nRenaissance of elements of civilization necessary for its perfection,\r\nbut not existing in the mediæval civilization of the fifteenth century;\r\nof elements of civilization which gave what the civilization of the\r\nfifteenth century,--which could give colour, perspective, grouping, and\r\nlandscape,--could never have afforded: the nude, drapery, and gesture.\r\n\r\nThe naked human body, which the Greeks, had trained, studied and\r\nidolized, did not exist in the fifteenth century; in its stead there was\r\nonly the undressed body, ill-developed, untrained, pinched, and\r\ndistorted by the garments only just cast off, cramped and bent by\r\nsedentary occupations, livid with the plague-spots of the Middle Ages,\r\nscarred by the whip-marks of asceticism. This stripped body, unseen and\r\nunfit to be seen, unaccustomed to the air and to the eyes of others,\r\nshivered and cowered for cold and for shame. The Giottesques ignored its\r\nvery existence, conceiving humanity as a bodiless creature, with face\r\nand hands to express emotion, and just enough malformed legs and feet to\r\nbe either standing or moving; further, beneath the garments there was\r\nnothing. The realists of the fifteenth century tore off the clothes and\r\ndrew the ugly thing beneath, and brought the corpses from the\r\nlazar-houses, and stole them from the gallows, in order to see how bone\r\nfitted into bone, and muscle was stretched over muscle. They learned to\r\nperfection the anatomy of the human frame, but they could not learn its\r\nbeauty; they became even reconciled to the ugliness they were accustomed\r\nto see, and, with their minds full of antique examples, Verrocchio,\r\nDonatello, Pollaiolo, and Ghirlandajo, the greatest anatomists of the\r\nfifteenth century, imitated their coarse and ill-made living models when\r\nthey imagined that they were imitating antique marbles.\r\n\r\nSo much for the nude. Drapery, as the ancients understood it in the\r\ndelicate plaits of Greek chiton and tunic, in the grand folds of Roman\r\ntoga, the fifteenth century could not show; it knew only the stiff,\r\nscanty raiment of the active classes, the shapeless masses of lined\r\ncloth of the merchants and magistrates, the prudish and ostentatious\r\nstarched dress of the women, and the coarse, lumpish garb of the monks.\r\n\r\nThe artist of the fifteenth century knew drapery only as an exotic, an\r\nexotic with whose representation the habit of seeing mediæval costume\r\nwas for ever interfering; on the stripped, unseemly, indecent body he\r\nplaces, with the stiffness of artificiality, drapery such as he has\r\nnever seen upon any living creature; the result is awkwardness and\r\nrigidity. And what attitude, what gesture, can he expect from this\r\nstripped and artificially draped model? None, for the model scarce knows\r\nhow to stand in so unaccustomed a condition of body. The artist must\r\nseek for attitude and gesture among his townsfolk, and among them he can\r\nfind only trivial, awkward, often vulgar movement. They have never been\r\ntaught how to stand or to move with grace and dignity; the artist must\r\nstudy attitude and gesture in the marketplace or the bull-baiting\r\nground, where Ghirlandajo found his jauntily strutting idlers, and\r\nVerrocchio his brutally staggering prize-fighters. Between the\r\nconstrained attitudinizing of Byzantine and Giottesque tradition, and\r\nthe imitation of the movements of clodhoppers and ragamuffins, the\r\nrealist of the fifteenth century would wander hopelessly were it not for\r\nthe antique. Genius and science are of no avail; the position of Christ\r\nin baptism in the paintings of Verrocchio and Ghirlandajo is mean and\r\nservile; the movements of the \"Thunderstricken\" in Signorelli's lunettes\r\nis an inconceivable mixture of the brutish, the melodramatic, and the\r\ncomic; the magnificently drawn youth at the door of the prison in\r\nFilippino's \"Liberation of St. Peter\" is gradually going to sleep and\r\ncollapsing in a fashion which is truly ignoble.\r\n\r\nAnd the same applies to sculptured figures or to figures standing\r\nisolated like statues; no Greek would have ventured upon the swaggering\r\nposition, with legs apart and elbows out, of Donatello's \"St. George,\"\r\nor Perugino's \"St. Michael;\" and a young Athenian who should have\r\nassumed the attitude of Verrocchio's \"David,\" with tripping legs and\r\nhand clapped on his hip, would have been sent away from school as a\r\nsaucy little ragamuffin.\r\n\r\nCoarse, nude, stiff drapery, vulgar attitude, was all that the fifteenth\r\ncentury could offer to its artists; but antiquity could offer more and\r\nvery different things--the naked body developed by the most artistic\r\ntraining, drapery the most natural and refined, and attitude and gesture\r\nregulated by an education the most careful and artistic; and all these\r\nthings antiquity gave to the artists of the Renaissance. They did not\r\ncopy antique statues as living naked men and women, but they corrected\r\nthe faults of their living models by the example of the statues; they\r\ndid not copy antique stone draperies in coloured pictures, but they\r\narranged the robes on their models with the antique folds well in their\r\nmemory; they did not give the gestures of statues to living figures, but\r\nthey made the living figures move in accordance with those principles of\r\nharmony which they had found exemplified in the statues.\r\n\r\nThey did not imitate the antique, they studied it; they obtained through\r\nthe fragments of antique sculpture a glimpse into the life of antiquity,\r\nand that glimpse served to correct the vulgarism and distortion of the\r\nmediæval life of the fifteenth century. In the perfection of Italian\r\npainting, the union of antique and modern being consummated, it is\r\nperhaps difficult to disentangle what really is antique from what is\r\nmodern; but in the earlier times, when the two elements were still\r\nseparate, we can see them opposite each other and compare them in the\r\nworks of the greatest artists. Wherever, in the paintings of the early\r\nRenaissance, there is realism, marked by the costume of the times, there\r\nis ugliness of form and vulgarity of movement; where there is idealism,\r\nmarked by imitation of the antique, the nude, and drapery, there is\r\nbeauty and dignity. We need only compare Filippino's \"Scene before the\r\nProconsul\" with his \"Raising of the King's Son\" in the Brancacci Chapel;\r\nthe grand attitude and draperies of Ghirlandajo's \"Zachariah\" with the\r\nvulgar dress and movements of the Florentine citizens surrounding him;\r\nBenozzo Gozzoli's noble naked figure of Noah with his ungainly,\r\nhideously dressed figure of Cosimo de' Medici; Mantegna's exquisite\r\nJudith with his preposterous Marquis of Mantua; in short all the purely\r\nrealistic with all the purely idealistic art of the fifteenth century.\r\nWe may give one last instance. In Signorelli's Orvieto frescoes there is\r\na figure of a young man, with aquiline features, long crisp hair and\r\nstrongly developed throat, which reappears unmistakably in all the\r\nfrescoes, and in some of them twice and thrice in various positions. His\r\nnaked figure is magnificent, his attitudes splendid, his thrown-back\r\nhead superb, whether he be slowly and painfully emerging from the earth,\r\nstaggered and gasping with his newly-infused life, or sinking oppressed\r\non the ground, broken and crushed by the sound of the trumpet of\r\njudgment; or whether he be moving forward with ineffable longing towards\r\nthe angel about to award him the crown of the blessed; in all these\r\npositions he is heroically beautiful.\r\n\r\nWe meet him again, unmistakable, but how different, in the realistic\r\ngroup of the \"Thunderstricken,\"--the long, lank youth, with\r\nspindle-shanks and egg-shaped body, bounding forward, with most\r\ngrotesque strides, over the uncouth heap of dead bodies, ungainly masses\r\nwith soles and nostrils uppermost, lying in beast-like confusion. This\r\nyouth, with something of a harlequin in his jumps and in his ridiculous\r\nthin legs and preposterous round body, is evidently the model for the\r\nnaked demi-gods of the \"Resurrection\" and the \"Paradise:\" he is the\r\nhandsome boy as the fifteenth century gave him to Signorelli; opposite,\r\nhe is the living youth of the fifteenth century idealized by the study\r\nof ancient sculpture; just as the \"Thunderstricken\" may be some scene of\r\nstreet massacre such as Signorelli may have witnessed at Cortona or\r\nPerugia, while the agonies of the \"Hell\" are the grouped and superb\r\nagonies taught by the antique; just as the two archangels of the \"Hell,\"\r\nin their armour of Baglioni's heavy cavalry, may represent the modern\r\nelement, and the same archangels, naked, with magnificent flying\r\ndraperies, blowing the trumpets of the Resurrection, may show the\r\nantique element in Renaissance art. The antique influence was not,\r\nindeed, equally strong throughout Italy; it was strongest in the Tuscan\r\nschool which, seeking for perfection of linear form, found that\r\nperfection in the antique; it was weakest in the Lombard and Venetian\r\nschools, which sought for what the antique could not give, light and\r\nshade and colour; the antique was most efficacious where it was most\r\nindispensable, and it was more necessary to a Tuscan, strong only with\r\nhis charcoal or pencil than to Leonardo da Vinci, who could make an\r\nimperfect figure, smiling mysteriously from out of the gloom, more\r\nfascinating than the finest drawn Florentine Madonna, and could surround\r\nan insignificant childish head with the wondrous sheen and ripple of\r\nhair, as with an aureole of poetry; it was also less necessary to\r\nGiorgione and Titian, who could hide coarse limbs beneath their\r\ndraperies of precious ruby, and transfigure, by the liquid gold of their\r\npalettes, a peasant woman into a goddess.\r\n\r\nBut even the Lombards, even the Venetians, required the antique\r\ninfluence. They could not perhaps have obtained it direct like the\r\nTuscans; the colourists and masters of light and shade might never have\r\nunderstood the blank lines and faint shadows of the marble: they\r\nreceived the antique influence, strong but modified by the medium\r\nthrough which it had passed, from Mantegna; and the relentless\r\nself-sacrifice to antiquity, the self-paralyzation of the great artist,\r\nwas not without its use; from Venetian Padua, Mantegna influenced the\r\nBellini and Giorgione; from Lombard Mantua, he influenced Leonardo; and\r\nMantegna's influence was that of the antique.\r\n\r\nWhat would have been the art of the Renaissance without the antique? The\r\nspeculation is vain, for the antique had influenced it, had been goading\r\nit on ever since the earliest times; it had been present at its birth,\r\nit had affected Giotto through Niccoto Pisano, and Masaccio through\r\nGhiberti; the antique influence cannot be conceived as absent in the\r\nhistory of Italian painting. So far, as a study of the impossible, the\r\nspeculation respecting the fate of Renaissance art had it not been\r\ninfluenced by the antique would be childishly useless. But lest we\r\nforget that this antique influence did exist, lest, grown ungrateful and\r\nblind, we refuse it its immense share in producing Michel Angelo,\r\nRaphael, and Titian, we may do well to turn to an art born and bred like\r\nItalian art, in the Middle Ages; like it, full of strength and power of\r\nself-development, but which, unlike Italian art, was not influenced by\r\nthe antique. This art is the great German art of the early sixteenth\r\ncentury; the art of Martin Schongauer, of Aldegrever, of Graf, of\r\nWohlgemuth, of Pencz, of Zatzinger, of Kranach, and of the great\r\nAlbrecht Dürer, whom they resemble as Pinturricchio, and Lo Spagna\r\nresemble Perugino, as Palma and Pario Bordone resemble Titian. This is\r\nan art born in a civilization less perfect indeed than that of Italy,\r\nnarrower, as Nürnberg is narrower than Florence, but resembling it in\r\nhabits, dress, religion, above all the main characteristic of being\r\nmediæval; and its masters, as great as their Italian contemporaries in\r\nall the technicalities of the art, and in absolute honesty of endeavour,\r\nmay show what the Italian art of the sixteenth century might have been\r\nwithout the antique. Let us therefore open a portfolio of those\r\nwonderful minute yet grand engravings of the old Germans. They are for\r\nthe most part Scriptural scenes or allegories, quite analogous to those\r\nof the Italians, but purely realistic, conscious of no world beyond that\r\nof an Imperial City of the year 1500. Here we have the whole turn-out,\r\nmale and female, of a German free town, in the shape of scenes from the\r\nlives of the Virgin and saints; here are short fat burghers, with\r\nenormous blotchy, bloated faces and little eyes set in fat, their huge\r\nstomachs protruding from under their jackets; here are blear-eyed\r\nladies, tall, thin, wrinkled though not old, with figures like hungry\r\nharpies, stalking about in high headgears and stiff gowns, or sitting by\r\nthe side of lean and stunted pages, singing (with dolorous voice) to\r\nlutes; or promenading under trees with long-shanked, high-shouldered\r\ngentlemen, with vacant sickly face and long scraggy hairs and beard,\r\ntheir bony elbows sticking out of their slashed doublets. These courtly\r\nfigures culminate in Dürer's magnificent plate of the wild man of the\r\nwoods kissing the hideous, leering Jezebel in her brocade and jewels.\r\nThese aristocratic women are terrible; prudish, malicious, licentious,\r\nnever modest because they are always ugly. Even the poor Madonnas,\r\nseated in front of village hovels or windmills, smile the smile of\r\nstarved, sickly sempstresses. It is a stunted, poverty-stricken,\r\nplague-sick society, this mediæval society of burghers and burghers'\r\nwives; the air seems bad and heavy, and the light wanting physically and\r\nmorally, in these old free towns; there is intellectual sickness as well\r\nas bodily in those musty gabled houses; the mediæval spirit blights what\r\nrevival of healthiness may exist in these commonwealths. And feudalism\r\nis outside the gates. There are the brutal, leering men-at-arms, in\r\nslashed, puffed doublets and heavy armour, face and dress as unhuman as\r\npossible, standing grimacing at the blood spurting from John the\r\nBaptist's decapitated trunk, as in Kranach's horrible print, while\r\ngaping spectators fill the castle yard; there are the castles high on\r\nrocks amidst woods, with miserable villages below, where the Prodigal\r\nSon wallows among the swine and the tattered boors tumble about in\r\ndrunkenness, or rest wearied on their spades. There are the Middle Ages\r\nin full force. But had these Germans of the days of Luther really no\r\nthought beyond their own times and their own country? Had they really\r\nno knowledge of the antique? Not so; they had heard from their learned\r\nmen, from Willibald Pirkheimer and Ulrich von Hutten, that the world had\r\nonce been peopled with naked gods and goddesses; nay, the very year\r\nperhaps that Raphael handed to the engraver, Marc Antonio, his\r\nmagnificent drawing of the Judgment of Paris, Lukas Kranach bethought\r\nhim to represent the story of the good Knight Paris giving the apple to\r\nthe Lady Venus. So Kranach took up his steady pencil and sharp chisel,\r\nand in strong, clear, minute lines of black and white showed us the\r\nscene. There, on Mount Ida, with a castellated rock in the distance, the\r\ncharger of Paris browses beneath some stunted larches; the Trojan\r\nknight's helmet, with its monstrous beak and plume, lies on the ground;\r\nand near it reclines Paris himself, lazy, in complete armour, with\r\nfrizzled fashionable beard. To him, all wrinkled and grinning with\r\nbrutal lust, comes another bearded knight, with wings to his vizored\r\nhelmet, Sir Mercury, leading the three goddesses, short, fat-cheeked\r\nGerman wenches, housemaids stripped of their clothes, stupid, brazen,\r\nindifferent. And Paris is evidently prepared with his choice: he awards\r\nthe apple to the fattest, for among a half-starved, plague-stricken\r\npeople like this, the chosen of gods and men must needs be the fattest.\r\n\r\nNo, such pagan scenes are mere burlesques, coarse mummeries, such as may\r\nhave amused Nürnberg and Augsburg during Shrovetide, when drunken louts\r\nfigured as Bacchus and sang drinking songs by Hans Sachs. There is no\r\nreality in all this; there is no belief in pagan gods. If we would see\r\nthe haunting divinity of the German Renaissance, we shall find him\r\nprying and prowling in nearly every scene of real life; him, the ever\r\npresent, the king of the Middle Ages, whose triumph we have seen on the\r\ncloister wall at Pisa, the lord \"Death.\" His fleshless face peers from\r\nbehind a bush at Zatzinger's stunted, fever-stricken lady and imbecile\r\ngentleman; he sits grinning on a tree in Orso Graf's allegory, while the\r\ncynical knights, with haggard, sensual faces, crack dirty jokes with the\r\nfat, brutish woman squatted below; he puts his hand into the basket of\r\nDürer's tattered pedlar; he leers hideously at the stirrup of Dürer's\r\narmed and stalwart knight. No gods of youth and Nature; no Hercules, no\r\nHermes, no Venus, have invaded his German territories, as they invaded\r\neven his own palace, the burial-ground at Pisa; the antique has not\r\nperverted Dürer and his fellows, as it perverted Masaccio, and\r\nSignorelli, and Mantegna, from the mediæval worship of Death.\r\n\r\nThe Italians had seen the antique and had let themselves be seduced by\r\nit, despite their civilization and their religion. Let us only rejoice\r\nthereat. There are indeed some, and among them the great English critic,\r\nwho is irrefutable when he is a poet and irrational when he becomes a\r\nphilosopher;--there are some who tell us that in its union with antique\r\nart, the art of the followers of Giotto embraced death, and rotted away\r\never after; there are others, more moderate but less logical, who would\r\nteach us that in uniting with the antique, the mediæval art of the\r\nfifteenth century purified and sanctified the beautiful but evil child\r\nof Paganism, that the goddess of Scopas and the athlete of Polyclete\r\nwere raised to a higher sphere when Raphael changed the one into a\r\nMadonna, and Michel Angelo metamorphosed the other into a prophet. But\r\nboth schools of criticism are wrong. Every civilization has its inherent\r\nevil; antiquity had its' inherent evils, as the Middle Ages had theirs;\r\nantiquity may have bequeathed to the Renaissance the bad with the good,\r\nas the Middle Ages had bequeathed to the Renaissance the good with the\r\nbad. But the art of antiquity was not the evil, it was the good of\r\nantiquity; it was born of its strength and its purity only and it was\r\nthe incarnation of its noblest qualities. It could not be purified,\r\nbecause it was spotless; it could not be sanctified because it was holy.\r\nIt could gain nothing from the art of the Middle Ages, alternately\r\nstrong in brutal reality, and languid in mystic inanity; the men of the\r\nRenaissance could, if they influenced it at all, influence the antique\r\nonly for evil; they belonged to an inferior artistic civilization, and\r\nif we conscientiously seek for the spiritual improvements brought by\r\nthem into antique types, we shall see that they consist in spoiling\r\ntheir perfect proportions, in making necks longer and muscles more\r\nprominent, in rendering more or less flaccid, or meagre, or coarse, the\r\ngrand and delicate forms of antique art. And when we have examined into\r\nthis purified art of the Renaissance, when we have compared coolly and\r\nequitably, we may perhaps confess that, while the Renaissance added\r\nimmense wealth of beauty in colour, perspective, and grouping, it took\r\naway something of the perfection of simple lines and modest light and\r\nshade of the antique; we may admit to ourselves that the grandest saint\r\nby Raphael is meagre and stunted, and the noblest Virgin by Titian is\r\noverblown and sensual by the side of the demi-gods and amazons of\r\nantique sculpture.\r\n\r\nThe antique perfected the art of the Renaissance, it did not corrupt it.\r\nThe art of the Renaissance fell indeed into shameful degradation soon\r\nafter the period of its triumphant union with the antique; and Raphael's\r\ngrand gods and goddesses, his exquisite Eros and radiant Psyche of the\r\nFarnesina, are indeed succeeded but too soon by the Olympus of Giulio\r\nRomano, an Olympus of harlots and acrobats, who smirk and mouth and\r\nwriggle and sprawl ignobly on the walls and ceilings of the dismantled\r\npalace which crumbles away among the stunted willows, the stagnant\r\npools, and rank grass of the marshes of Mantua. But this is no more the\r\nfault of antiquity than it is the fault of the Middle Ages; it is the\r\nfault of that great principle of life and of change which makes all\r\nthings organic, be they physical or intellectual, germinate, grow,\r\nattain maturity, and then fade, wither, and rot. The dead art of\r\nantiquity could never have brought the art of the Renaissance to an\r\nuntimely end; the art of the Renaissance decayed because it was mature,\r\nand died because it had lived.\r\n\r\n  VERNON LEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION OF COMTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nIn my last article I considered the subjective synthesis of Comte, or in\r\nother words, his attempt to systematize human knowledge in relation to\r\nthe moral life of man. For it is his view, as we have seen, that science\r\ncan never yield its highest fruit to man unless it be\r\nsystematized--_i.e._, unless its different parts be connected together\r\nand put in their true place as parts of one whole. Scattered lights give\r\nno illumination; it is the _esprit d'ensemble_, the general idea in\r\nwhich our knowledge begins and ends, that ultimately determines the\r\nscientific value of each special branch of knowledge. But while\r\nsynthesis is necessary, it is not necessary, according to Comte, that\r\nthe synthesis should be objective. The error of mankind in the past has\r\nbeen that they supposed themselves able to ascertain the real or\r\nobjective principle, which gives unity to the world, and able,\r\ntherefore, to make their system of knowledge an ideal repetition of the\r\nsystem of things without them. Such a system, however, is entirely\r\nbeyond our reach. The conditions of our lot, and the weakness of our\r\nintelligence, make it impossible for us to tell what is the real\r\nprinciple of unity in the world, or even whether such a principle\r\nexists. The attempts to discover it, made by Theology and Metaphysics,\r\nhave been nothing more than elaborate anthropomorphisms, in which men\r\ngave to the unknown and unknowable reality, a form which was borrowed\r\nfrom their own. They saw in the clouds about them an exaggerated and\r\ndistorted reflection of themselves, and regarded this Brocken spectre as\r\nthe controlling power whose activity was the source and explanation of\r\neverything. Positivism, on the other hand, arises whenever men learn to\r\nrecognize the nature of this illusion, and to confine their ambition\r\nwithin that which is really the limit of their intelligence. All that we\r\ncan know is the resemblances and successions of phenomena, and not the\r\nthings in themselves that are their causes; and if we seek to find a\r\nprinciple of unity for these phenomena, we must find it within and not\r\nwithout. We must organize knowledge with reference to our own wants,\r\nrather than with reference to the nature of things. We must regard\r\neverything as a means to an end, which is determined by some inner\r\nprinciple in ourselves--not as if we supposed that the world and all\r\nthat is in it were made for us, or found its centre in us--but simply\r\nbecause this is the only point of view from which we can systematize\r\nknowledge, as it is indeed the only point of view from which we need\r\ncare to systematize it.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why system is necessary at all, why we should not be\r\ncontent with a fragmentary consciousness of the world, without\r\nattempting to gather the dispersed lights of science to one central\r\nprinciple. To critics like J. S. Mill, Comte's effort after system seems\r\nto be the result of an \"original mental twist very common in French\r\nthinkers,\" of \"an inordinate desire of unity.\" \"That all perfection\r\nconsists in unity, Comte apparently considers to be a maxim which no\r\nsane man thinks of questioning: it never seems to enter into his\r\nconceptions that any one could object _ad initio_, and ask, Why this\r\nuniversal systematizing, systematizing, systematizing? Why is it\r\nnecessary that all human life should point but to one object, and be\r\ncultivated into a system of means to a single end?\"[26] To this Mr.\r\nBridges answers that unity in Comte's sense is \"the first and most\r\nobvious condition which all moral and religious renovators, of whatever\r\ntime or country, have by the very nature of their office set themselves\r\nto fulfil.\"[27] In other words, all moral and spiritual life depends\r\nupon the harmony of the individual with himself and with the world. A\r\ndivided life is a life of weakness and misery, nor can life be divided\r\nintellectually, without being, or ultimately becoming, divided morally.\r\nSuch unity, indeed, does not exclude--and in a being like man who is in\r\ncourse of development cannot altogether exclude--difference and even\r\nconflict. In the most steadily growing intellectual life there are\r\npauses of difficulty and doubt; in the most continuous moral progress\r\nthere are conflicts with self and others. But such doubts and\r\ndifficulties will not greatly weaken or disturb us, so long as they are\r\npartial, so long as they do not affect the central principles of thought\r\nand action, so long as there is still some fixed faith which reaches\r\nbeyond the disturbance, some certitude which is untouched by the doubt.\r\nIf, however, we once lose the consciousness that there is any such\r\nprinciple, or if we try to rest on a principle which we at the same time\r\nfeel to be inadequate, our spiritual life, in losing its unity or\r\nharmony with itself, must at the same time lose its purity and energy.\r\nIt must become fitful and uncertain, the sport of accidental influences\r\nand tendencies; it must lower its moral and intellectual aims. This, in\r\nComte's view, is what we have seen in the past. The decay of the old\r\nfaiths, and of the objective synthesis based upon them, has emancipated\r\nus from many illusions, but it has, as it were, taken the inspiration\r\nout of our lives. It has made knowledge a thing for specialists who have\r\nlost the sense of totality, the sense of the value of their particular\r\nstudies in relation to the whole; and it has made action feeble and\r\nwayward by depriving men of the conviction that there is any great\r\ncentral aim to be achieved by it. And these results would have been\r\nstill more obvious, were it not that men are so slow in realizing what\r\nis involved in the change of their beliefs were it not that the habits\r\nand sympathies developed by a creed continue to exist long after the\r\ncreed itself has disappeared. In the long run, however, the change of\r\nman's intellectual attitude to the world must bring with it a change of\r\nhis whole life. As the creed which reconciled him to the world and bound\r\nhim to his fellows ceases to affect him, he must be thrown back upon his\r\nown mere individuality, unless he can find another creed of equal or\r\ngreater power to inspire and direct his life. And mere individualism is\r\nnothing, but anarchy. That this is so, was not indeed manifest to those\r\nwho first expressed the individualistic principle: on the contrary, they\r\nseemed to themselves to have, in the assertion of individual right, not\r\nonly an instrument for destroying the old faith and the old social\r\norder, but also the principle of a better faith, and the means of\r\nreconstructing a better order. But to us who have outlived the period\r\nwhen it could be supposed that the destruction of old, involves in\r\nitself the construction of new, forms of life and thought, it cannot but\r\nbe obvious that the principles of private judgment and individual\r\nliberty are nothing more than negations. For as the real problem of our\r\nintellectual life is how to rise to a judgment which is more than\r\nprivate judgment, so the real problem of our practical life is how to\r\nrealize a liberty that is more than individual license. It is in this\r\nsense that Comte says that the last three centuries have been a period\r\nof the insurrection of the intellect against the heart, a phrase by\r\nwhich he means to indicate at once the gain and the loss of the\r\nrevolutionary movement; its gain, in so far as it emancipated the\r\nintelligence from superstitious illusions, and its loss, in so far as it\r\ndestroyed the faith which was the bond of social union, without\r\nsubstituting any other faith in its room. At the same time, the\r\nexpression points to a peculiarity of Comte's Psychology, which affects\r\nhis whole view of the history, and especially of the religious history,\r\nof man; and it is therefore necessary to subject it to a careful\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nIs it possible for the intellect to be in insurrection against the\r\nheart? In a sense already indicated this is possible. It is possible, in\r\nshort, that the moral and intellectual spirit of a belief may still\r\ncontrol the life of one who, so far as his explicit consciousness is\r\nconcerned, has renounced it. Rooted as the individual is in a wider life\r\nthan his own, it is often but a small part of himself that he can bring\r\nto distinct consciousness. Further, so little are most men accustomed to\r\nself-analysis; that they are seldom aware what it is that constitutes\r\nthe inspiring power of their beliefs. Generally, at least in the first\r\ninstance, they take their creed in gross, without distinguishing between\r\nessential and unessential elements. They confuse, in one general\r\nconsecration of reverence, its primary principles, and the local and\r\ntemporary accidents of the form in which it was first presented to them,\r\nand they are as ready to accept battle _à l'outrance_ for some useless\r\noutwork as for the citadel itself. And, for the same reason, they are\r\nready to think that the citadel is lost when the outwork is taken; to\r\nsuppose, _e.g._, that the spiritual nature of man is a fiction if he was\r\nnot directly made by God out of the dust of the earth, or that the\r\nChristian view of life has ceased to be true if a doubt can be thrown on\r\nthe possibility of proving miracles. Yet however little the individual\r\nmay be able to separate the particulars which are assailed from the\r\nuniversal with which they are accidentally connected, his whole nature\r\nmust rebel against the sacrifice which logical consistency seems in such\r\na case to demand from him. It is a painful experience when the first\r\nbreak is made in the implicit unity of early faith, and it is painful\r\njust in proportion to the depth of the spiritual consciousness which\r\nthat faith has produced in the individual. Unable to separate that which\r\nhe is obliged to doubt from that in which lies the principle of his\r\nmoral, and, even of his intellectual, life, he is \"in a strait betwixt\r\ntwo;\" and no course seems to be open to him which does not involve the\r\nsurrender, either of his intellectual honesty, or of that higher\r\nconsciousness which alone \"makes life worth living,\" Such a crisis is\r\ncommonly described as a division between the heart and the head, for in\r\nit the articulate or conscious logic is on the side of disbelief, and\r\nthe resisting conviction generally takes the form of a feeling, an\r\nimpulse, an intuition, which the individual has for himself, but which\r\nhe is unable to communicate in the same force to another. And, as such\r\nfeelings and intuitions of the individual are necessarily subject to\r\ncontinual variation of intensity and clearness, so the struggle between\r\ndoubt and faith may be long and difficult, the objections, which at one\r\ntime seem as nothing, at another time appearing to be almost\r\nirresistible. Not seldom the result is a broken life, in which youth is\r\ngiven to revolt, and the rest of existence to a faith which vainly\r\nstrives to be implicit. There is, indeed, no final and satisfactory\r\nissue from such an endless internal debate and conflict, until the\r\n\"heart\" has learned to speak the language of the \"head,\"--_i.e._, until\r\nthe permanent principles which underlay and gave strength to faith have\r\nbeen brought into the light of distinct consciousness, and until it has\r\nbeen discovered how to separate them from the accidents, with which at\r\nfirst they were necessarily identified. The hard labour of\r\ndistinguishing, in the traditions of the past, between the germinative\r\nprinciples, out of which the future must spring, and those external\r\nforms and adjuncts, which every day is making more incredible, must be\r\nundertaken by any one who would restore the broken unity of man's life.\r\nWe begin our existence under the shadow and influence of a faith which\r\nis given to us, as it were; in our sleep; but in no age, and in this\r\nage less than any other, can man possess a spiritual life as a gift from\r\nthe past without reconquering it for himself.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, then, we can understand how Comte might speak of an\r\ninsurrection of the intelligence against the heart, which must be\r\nquelled ere the normal state of humanity could be restored; for this\r\nwould be only another way of saying that, in the modern conflict of\r\nfaith and reason, the substantial truth, or at least the most important\r\ntruth, had, up to Comte's own time, been on the side of the former. In\r\nthis view, the deep unwillingness of those nourished in the Christian or\r\nCatholic faith to yield to the logical battery of the Encyclopædists was\r\nnot merely the result of an obscurantist hatred of light; it was also in\r\ngreat part due to a more or less definite sense of the moral, if not the\r\nintellectual, weakness of the principles which the Encyclopædists\r\nmaintained. For, while the insurrection was justified in so far as it\r\nasserted the claims of the special sciences, it was to be condemned in\r\nso far as it involved the denial of all synthesis whatever, and also in\r\nso far as it was blind to the elements of truth in the imperfect\r\nsynthesis of the past. It thus tended to destroy the spirit of totality\r\nand the sense of duty (_l'esprit d'ensemble et le sentiment du\r\ndevoir_).[28] It practically denied the existence of any universal\r\nprinciple which could connect the different parts of knowledge with each\r\nother, of any general aim which could give unity to the life of man. Its\r\nanalytic spirit was fatal, not only to the fictions of theology, but\r\nalso to that growing consciousness of the solidarity of men of which\r\ntheology had been the accidental embodiment. The reluctance of religious\r\nmen to admit the claims of what appeared to be, and, indeed, to a\r\ncertain extent was, light, was thus due to a more or less distinct\r\nperception that their own creed, amid all its partial errors, contained\r\na central truth more important than all the partial truths of science.\r\nIn clinging to the past they were preserving the germ of the future, and\r\nthe final victory of science could not come until this germ had been\r\ndisengaged from the husk of superstition under which it was hidden. Till\r\nthat was done, the logic of the heart in clinging to its superstitions\r\nwas better than the logic of the head in rebelling against them. In\r\nother words, the implicit reason of faith was wiser than the explicit\r\nreason of science.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all that Comte means. For him the appeal to the heart is\r\nnot merely the appeal to feelings and intuitions, which are the result\r\nof the past development of human intelligence, and especially of the\r\nlong discipline by which the Christian Church has moulded the modern\r\nspirit; it is an appeal to the altruistic affections as original or\r\n\"innate\" tendencies in man which are altogether independent of his\r\nintelligence. It is not that the reason of man often speaks through his\r\nfeelings, but that feeling and reason have in themselves different, and\r\neven it may be opposite, voices. In this sense, the attempt has often\r\nbeen made in modern times to stop the invasions of critical reflection\r\nby setting up the heart as an independent authority. From the Lutheran\r\ntheologian who said, \"_Pectus theologum facit_,\" down to Mr. Tennyson\r\nwho declares that whenever he heard \"the voice--Believe no more,\"\r\n\r\n  \"A warmth within the breast would melt\r\n    The freezing reason's colder part,\r\n    And like a man in wrath, the heart\r\n  Stood up and answered, 'I have felt:'\"\r\n\r\nappeals have constantly been made to the feelings to resist the\r\nintrusion of doubt. Such appeals, however, cannot be regarded as\r\notherwise than provisional and self-defensive. \"The heart knoweth its\r\nown bitterness, and a stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy;\" but\r\njust for that reason it has no general content or independent authority\r\nof its own. Whether the \"I feel it\" mean little or much, depends upon\r\nthe individual who utters it. It may be the concentrated expression of a\r\nlong life of culture and discipline, or it may be the loud but empty\r\nvoice of untrained passion and prejudice. The \"unproved assertions of\r\nthe wise and experienced,\" as Aristotle tells us, have great value,\r\nespecially in ethical matters; but it is not because they are unproved\r\nassertions, but because we otherwise know that the speakers are wise and\r\nexperienced. To appeal to the heart in general, without saying \"whose\r\nheart,\" either means nothing, or it means an appeal to the natural\r\nman--_i.e._, man as he is before he has been sophisticated by culture\r\nand experience; but of the natural man, in this sense, nothing can be\r\nsaid. The further we go back in the history of the individual or the\r\nrace the more imperfect does their utterance or manifestation become;\r\nand when we reach the beginning, we find that there is no manifestation\r\nor utterance at all. The natural man of Rousseau was simply an ideal\r\ncreation, inspired with that intense and even morbid consciousness of\r\nself, and that fixed resolve to submit to no external law, which were\r\ncharacteristic of Rousseau himself, and which in him were the last\r\nproduct and quintessence of the individualism of the eighteenth century.\r\nThe simplicity of this ideal figure was not the first simplicity of\r\nnature, but the simplicity of a spirit which has returned upon itself\r\nand asserted itself against the world; a kind of simplicity which never\r\nexisted, at least in the same form, before the great Protestant revolt.\r\nThe unhistorical character of this idea becomes doubly evident when we\r\nfind that, as time goes on, and the spirit of the age alters, the\r\nqualities of the natural man are also changed. To St. Simon and Fourier,\r\nas to Rousseau, man is good by nature, and it is bad institutions or bad\r\nexternal influences which are the source of all the ills that flesh is\r\nheir to. But while with the latter the natural man is a solitary, whose\r\nchief good lies in the preservation of his independence, with the former\r\nhe is essentially social, and what is wanted for his perfection and\r\nhappiness is only to contrive an outward organization in which his\r\nsocial sympathies shall have free play. Comte, as we might expect, rises\r\nabove these imperfect theories, in so far as he refuses to attribute all\r\nthe evils of humanity to its external circumstances; but he does not get\r\nrid of the essential error which was common to them all, the error of\r\nseeking for the explanation of the higher life of humanity in the\r\nfeelings of the natural man--feelings which are prior to, and\r\nindependent of, the exercise of his reason, and which supply all the\r\npossible motives for that exercise. There are, in his view, two sets of\r\n\"innate\" feelings or desires, between which man's life is divided--the\r\negoistic and the altruistic tendencies, each separate from the others as\r\nwell as from the intelligence, and having its \"organ\" in a separate part\r\nof the brain. The egoistic feelings at first exist in man in far greater\r\nstrength than the altruistic; but by the reaction of circumstances, and\r\nthe influence of men upon each other, the latter have in the past\r\ngradually attained to greater power; and it is the ideal of the future\r\nto make their victory complete. Meanwhile, the intelligence is\r\nnecessarily the instrument of desire, and its highest good is to be the\r\ninstrument of altruistic as opposed to egoistic desire. For it has at\r\nbest only a choice of masters, and the emancipation of the intelligence\r\nfrom the heart could mean only its becoming a slave of personal vanity.\r\nComte's appeal, therefore, is still to the natural man, or rather to one\r\nelement in him, which, however, as he acknowledges, is never so weak as\r\nit is in man's earliest or most natural state.\r\n\r\nThe psychology implied in this theory is substantially that which found\r\nits fullest expression in Hume's Treatise on Human Nature. Hume, with\r\nthat tendency to bring things to a distinct issue which is his best\r\ncharacteristic, declares boldly that \"reason is, and ought to be, the\r\nslave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to\r\nserve and obey them.\" The passions or desires are tendencies of a\r\ndefinite character which exist in man from the first; the awaking\r\nintelligence cannot add to their number, or essentially change their\r\nnature. It can only take account of what they are, and calculate how\r\nbest to satisfy them. \"We speak not strictly and philosophically when we\r\ntalk of the combat of reason and passion,\" for reason in itself\r\ndetermines the true and false, but it sets nothing before us as an end\r\nto be pursued and avoided. It does not constitute or transform the\r\ndesires, which are given altogether apart from it, and the will is but\r\nthe strongest desire. When we say that reason controls the passions what\r\nwe mean is simply that a strong but calm tendency of our nature, which\r\nhas reference to some remote object, overcomes some violent impulse\r\ntowards a present delight; but for intelligence, in the strict sense of\r\nthe word, to war with passion is a simple impossibility.\r\n\r\nThe modifications which Comte makes in this view of motive are\r\ncomparatively trifling. He does not, indeed, like Hume, call reason the\r\nslave of the passions; rather he says that \"_l'esprit doit être le\r\nministre du coeur, mais jamais son esclave_;\" but this change of\r\nlanguage does not involve any important modification of Hume's theory.\r\nThe intelligence has to give to the heart all kinds of information about\r\nthe objects through which it may find satisfaction, but after all the\r\nend itself has to be determined solely by feeling and desire. In Comte's\r\nlanguage the intellect is a \"slave,\" when theology makes it acknowledge\r\nthe existence of supernatural beings who are agreeable to our desires,\r\nbut who have no reality as objects of experience; it is a \"master,\" when\r\nit pursues its inquiries into the phenomena of the objective world, at\r\nthe bidding of an errant curiosity, without reference to the well-being\r\nof man; it is in its true place as a \"servant\" when it studies the\r\nobjective world freely, but only with reference to the end fixed for it\r\nby the affections. \"_L'univers doit être étudié non pour lui-même, mais\r\npour l'homme, ou plutôt pour l'humanité_;\" and this, Comte thinks, will\r\nnot be done if the intelligence be left to itself, but only if it be\r\nmade subordinate to the heart. To say, therefore, that the intelligence\r\nis not to be a slave but a servant, implies merely that it is to be left\r\nfree to collect information about the means of satisfying the desires,\r\nwithout having its judgment anticipated by the imagination or the heart;\r\nbut that, on the other hand, it must keep strictly to its position as an\r\ninstrument to an end out of itself. For if it once emancipates itself\r\nfrom the yoke of feeling, it soon becomes altogether lawless, and\r\ndisperses its efforts in every direction in the satisfaction of a vain\r\ncuriosity. The intelligence, as the scholastic theologians said, is in\r\nitself, or when left to itself, a source of anarchy and confusion; it\r\nmust be, not indeed the _serva_, but the _ancilla fidei_, or it defeats\r\nits own ends. The intellectual life, as such, is an unsocial, even a\r\nselfish existence; for, as reason is guided by no definite objective aim\r\nderived from itself, it must find its real motive in the satisfaction of\r\npersonal vanity and self-conceit, whenever it is not subjected to the\r\nyoke of the altruistic affections.\r\n\r\nThis theory (which, as we shall see, underlies Comte's whole conception\r\nof history) suggests two questions. It leads us to ask, in the first\r\nplace, whether the tendencies of the intellectual life are thus\r\ndispersive and opposed to the social tendencies? and, secondly, whether\r\nthe social tendencies in the form which they take with man, are not\r\nnecessarily determined to be what they are by his intelligence? The\r\nformer question really resolves itself into another: Is the intelligence\r\nof man a mere formal power of apprehending what is presented to it from\r\nwithout, so that when it is left to itself it must lose itself in the\r\ninfinite multiplicity of individual objects in the external world? or\r\ndoes it carry with it any synthetic principle, any idea of the whole, to\r\nwhich it necessarily and inevitably seeks to bring back the difference\r\nof things? Against Comte's assertion that the natural tendency of the\r\nintelligence is to lose itself in difference without end, we might quote\r\nthe well-known saying of Bacon, that the tendency of the \"_intellectus\r\nsibi permissus_\" is rather towards a premature synthesis. \"_Intellectus\r\nhumanus ex proprietate sua facile supponit majorem ordinem et\r\næqualitatem in rebus quam invenit_.\" Surely, if we may speak of\r\ntendencies of the intellectual life as separated from the life of\r\nfeeling, the tendency to unity and the universal belongs to it quite as\r\nmuch as the tendency to difference and the particular; just as in the\r\nlife of feeling the tendency to isolation and self-assertion against\r\nothers is combined with the tendency to society and union with others.\r\nFrom the first moment of intellectual life the world is to us a unity;\r\n_subjectively_ a unity, as all its varied phenomena are gathered up in\r\nthe consciousness of one self, and _objectively_ a unity, as every\r\nobject and event is definitely placed in relation to the other objects\r\nand events in one space and one time. The development of knowledge is,\r\nno doubt, the continual detection of new differences and distinctions in\r\nthings, but the phenomena which are distinguished from other phenomena\r\nare at the same time put in relation to them. Nor can the intelligence\r\nfind complete satisfaction until this relation is discovered to be\r\nnecessary, and thus difference passes into unity again. Individual\r\nminds, indeed, may be more of the Aristotelian, or more of the\r\nPlatonist, order, may tend more to divide what at first is presented as\r\nunity, or to unite what at first is presented as difference. But it is\r\nabsurd to talk of either tendency as belonging to the intelligence in\r\nitself, since it is utterly beyond, or rather beneath, the powers of\r\nthought to conceive either of an undifferentiated unity, or of a chaos\r\nof differences without some kind of relation. Descending to particulars,\r\nwe may bring Comte as a witness against himself; for while he declares\r\nthat the sciences which deal with the inorganic world are mainly\r\nanalytic in their tendencies, he at the same time maintains that the\r\nsciences of Biology and, still more, of Sociology and Morals, are\r\nsynthetic, since they deal with objects in which the whole is not a mere\r\naggregation or resultant of the parts, but in which rather the parts can\r\nbe understood only in and through the whole. Hence it would seem that\r\nthe dispersive tendencies of science are confined to lower steps of the\r\nscientific scale; and that the final science (as was shown more\r\nparticularly in a previous article) admits and necessitates a synthesis,\r\nwhich is not merely subjective, but also objective. For Comte does not\r\nhold that we are to regard other men merely as means, or to seek to\r\nunderstand them only so far as is necessary for the gratification of\r\nsome desire in ourselves as individuals. We are, on the contrary, to\r\nseek to know man in and for himself; and when we do so know him, we find\r\nthat he is essentially social, and that the individual, as such, is a\r\nmere \"fiction of the metaphysicians.\" Here, again, therefore, we find\r\nthat Comte's system ends in a compromise between opposite tendencies of\r\nthought. His subjective synthesis proved after all to be objective, at\r\nleast so far as mankind were concerned; and in like manner his\r\nopposition of the intellect to the heart turns out to be only partial;\r\nfor when the intelligence is directed to psychology and sociology, it\r\ngives us an idea of humanity, according to which all men are \"members\r\none of another.\" The warfare of the heart and the intelligence thus\r\nresolves itself into another expression of that dualism between the\r\nworld and man, which we found to be an essential characteristic of\r\nComte's system.\r\n\r\nThe second question--whether the altruistic affections of man do not\r\nimply, or are not necessarily connected with, the development of his\r\nreason or self-consciousness--is even more important. Comte, like Hume,\r\ntook all the desires, higher and lower, as tendencies given apart from\r\nthe reason, which can only devise the means of satisfying them, and is,\r\ntherefore, necessarily their servant. Reason itself on this view does\r\nnot essentially affect the character of those tendencies which it obeys.\r\n\"_Cupiditas est appetitus cum ejusdem conscientia_,\" said Spinoza, and\r\nhe then went on to speak as if the \"_conscientia_\" made no change in the\r\ncharacter of the \"_appetitus_.\" But if we think of appetites or\r\ndesires--some of them tending to the good of the individual, others to\r\nthe good of the species--as existing in an animal which is not conscious\r\nof a self, these appetites will neither be selfish nor unselfish in the\r\nsense in which we apply these terms to man. Where there is no _ego_\r\nthere can be no _alter-ego_, and therefore neither egoism nor altruism.\r\nThe idea of the self as a permanent unity to which all the different\r\ntendencies are referred, and the rise in consequence of a new desire of\r\npleasure, distinct from the desires of particular objects, are essential\r\nto egoism. The idea of an _alter-ego_, _i.e._, of a community with\r\nothers which makes their interests our own, and hence the rise of a love\r\nfor them,--which is not merely disinterested as the animal appetites are\r\ndisinterested, because they tend directly to their objects without any\r\nthought of self, but disinterested in the sense that the thought of self\r\nis conquered or absorbed, is essential to altruism. Each of these\r\ntendencies may in its matter, or rather in its first matter, coincide\r\nwith the appetites; viewed from the outside, they may seem to be nothing\r\nhigher than hunger or thirst, or sexual or parental impulse, but their\r\nform is different. They are changed as by a chemical solvent, which\r\ndissolves and renews them; nay, as by a new principle of life, whose\r\nfirst transformation of them is nothing but the beginning of a series of\r\ntransformations both of their matter and their form; so that, in the\r\nend, the simple direct tendency to an object--the uneasiness which\r\nsought its cure without reflection either upon itself or upon anything\r\nelse--becomes changed, on the one side, into a gigantic ambition and\r\ngreed, which would make the whole world tributary to the lust of the\r\nindividual, and, on the other, into a love of humanity in which\r\nself-love is altogether transcended or absorbed. Neither of these,\r\nhowever, nor any lower form of either, is in such wise _external_ to\r\nreason, that we can talk of them as determining it to an end which is\r\nnot its own. Both are simply the expression in feeling of that essential\r\nopposition of the self to the not self, and at the same time that\r\nessential unity of the self with the not self, which are the two\r\nopposite, but complementary, aspects of the life of reason. And the\r\nprogressive triumph of altruism over egoism, which constitutes the moral\r\nsignificance of history, is only the result of the fact that an\r\nindividual, who is also a conscious self, cannot find his happiness in\r\nhis own individual life, but only in the life of the whole to which he\r\nbelongs. A selfish life is for him a contradiction. It is a life in\r\nwhich he is at war with himself as well as with others, for it is the\r\nlife of a being who, though essentially social, tries to find\r\nsatisfaction in a personal or individual good. The \"intelligence\" and\r\nthe \"heart\" equally condemn such a life; it is not only a crime but a\r\nblunder. For a spiritual being as such is one who can only save his life\r\nby losing it in a wider life, one who must die to himself in order that\r\nhe may live. In the progress of man's spirit, therefore, there is no\r\nnecessary or possible schism between the two parts of his being; but, on\r\nthe contrary, the development of each is implied in the development of\r\nthe other. It is the more comprehensive idea, as well as the higher\r\nsocial purpose, which always triumphs; and if what is called\r\nintellectual culture sometimes seems to have the worse, it is because it\r\nis a superficial or formal culture, and does not really represent the\r\nmost comprehensive idea.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to observe that the opposition of the heart to the\r\nintelligence is Comte's key to the whole history of the past, especially\r\nin relation to religion. Theology is to him a system growing out of a\r\nnatural, though partially erroneous, hypothesis, a hypothesis which in\r\nits first appearance was well suited to excite the nascent intelligence\r\nand satisfy the primary affections of man, but which, in its further\r\ndevelopment, tended to secure moral and social ends at the expense of\r\ntruth, and became more and more irrational as it became more and more\r\nuseful. Fetichism, the first religion, was the spontaneous result of\r\nman's primitive tendency to exaggerate the likeness of all things to\r\nhimself. It is \"less distant from Positivity\" than any other sort of\r\ntheology,[29] for its error is only that it supposes the existence of\r\nlife wherever it finds activity--an error which can \"easily be brought\r\nto the test of verification\" and corrected. \"We can show it to be an\r\nerror, and so get rid of it.\" But Polytheism, seeking for greater\r\ngenerality, refers phenomena to beings who are not identified with them,\r\nto \"indirect wills belonging to beings purely imaginary,\" whose\r\n\"existence can no more be decisively disproved than it can be\r\ndemonstrated.\" Further, Polytheism extended to the order of man's life\r\nthat kind of explanation which Fetichism necessarily confined to nature,\r\nbecause the latter sought to explain everything by man, and never\r\nthought of man himself as requiring explanation. But this, while it had\r\nthe advantage of bringing human life within the domain of speculation,\r\nat the same time reduced theology into a palpable instance of reasoning\r\nin a circle. For \"humanity cannot legitimately be included in the\r\nsynthesis of causes, from the very fact that its type is found in\r\nman.\"[30] Last of all came Monotheism, concentrating still further the\r\ntheological explanation of the universe, but rendering it still more\r\nincoherent and irrational, for \"the conception of a single God involves\r\na type of absolute perfection complete in each of the three aspects of\r\nhuman nature, affection, thought, and action. Now such a conception\r\nunavoidably contradicts itself, for either this all-powerful Being must\r\nbe inferior to ourselves, morally or intellectually, or else the world\r\nwhich he created must be free from those radical imperfections which, in\r\nspite of Monotheistic sophistry, have been always but too evident. And\r\neven were this second alternative admissible, there would remain a yet\r\ndeeper inconsistency. Man's moral and mental faculties have for their\r\nobject to subserve practical necessities, but an omnipotent Being can\r\nhave no occasion either for wisdom or for goodness.\"[31]\r\n\r\nWhat reconciles mankind, and especially the leaders of mankind, to these\r\nintellectually unsatisfactory conceptions of God, is their practical\r\nvalue in extending and strengthening the social bond. Polytheism was\r\nsuperior to Fetichism, because it lent itself to the formation of that\r\nwider community, which we call the State, whereas Fetichism tended\r\nrather to confine the sympathies of men to the narrower limits of the\r\nfamily. And Monotheism was the necessary basis of that still wider\r\nsociety which binds men to each other simply as men, and apart from any\r\nspecial ties of blood or language. This at least was the case so long as\r\nthe truth of the unity of humanity had not yet assumed a scientific\r\nform, and therefore still needed an external support. But when the\r\nsciences of sociology and morals arise, this external scaffolding ceases\r\nto be necessary, and must even become injurious, as, indeed, Theology\r\nwas from the first imperfectly adapted to the social end it was made to\r\nsubserve.\r\n\r\nThis last point deserves special attention. According to Comte,\r\nTheology, and above all Monotheistic Theology, is a system whose direct\r\ninfluence is altogether unfavourable to the social tendencies, although\r\nindirectly, by the course of history, and through the wise modifications\r\nto which it has been subjected by the leaders and teachers of mankind,\r\nit has become the main instrument in developing altruism. The increasing\r\ngenerality of theological belief, indeed, was a necessary condition of\r\nthe establishment of social unity; but, by directing the eyes of men not\r\nto themselves, but to supernatural beings, by making the event of life\r\nturn on the favour or disfavour of such beings, rather than on the\r\nsocial action and reaction of men upon each other, and by reducing this\r\nworld into a secondary position, so that its concerns were subordinated\r\nto those of another world, Theology tended to dissolve rather than to\r\nknit closer the bonds of society. The relation of the individual to God\r\nisolated him from his fellows. Especially was this the case with the\r\nChristian form of Monotheism, with its tremendous future rewards and\r\npenalties, and the direct relation which it established between the soul\r\nof the individual and the infinite Being. \"The immediate effect of\r\nputting personal salvation in the foremost place was to create an\r\nunparalleled selfishness, a selfishness rendering all social influences\r\nnugatory, and thus tending to dissolve public life.\"[32] \"The Christian\r\ntype of life was never fully realized except by the hermits of the\r\nThebaid,\" who, \"by narrowing their wants to the lowest standard, were\r\nable to concentrate their thoughts without remorse or distraction on the\r\nattainment of salvation.\"[33] What else, indeed, but egoism could be\r\nawakened by the worship of a God who is himself the supreme type of\r\negoism? For \"the desires of an omnipotent Being, being gratified as soon\r\nas formed, can consist in nothing but pure caprices. There can be no\r\nappreciable motive either from within or from without. And above all,\r\nthese pure caprices must of necessity be purely personal; so that the\r\nmetaphysical formula, To live in self for self, would be alike\r\napplicable to the two extreme grades of the vital scale. The type of\r\ndivinity thus approximates to the lowest stage of animality, the only\r\nshape in which life is purely individual, because it is reduced to the\r\none function of nutrition.\"[34] The natural result of such a religion\r\nwas, therefore, to discourage the altruistic affections, and, indeed,\r\nMonotheism has systematically denied that such affections form part of\r\nthe nature of man.\r\n\r\nThe alchemy which, according to Comte, turned this poison into an elixir\r\nvitæ, was found in the altruistic affections of the teachers of mankind,\r\nwhich led them to limit and modify the doctrine they taught, so as to\r\nsubserve man's moral improvement. This, however, would not have been\r\nsufficient, if these teachers had not at an early period ceased to be a\r\ntheocracy, or, in other words, if the practical government of mankind\r\nhad not been wrested from their hand by the military classes. By this\r\nchange, which contained in itself the germ of the separation of the\r\nChurch from the State, of theory from practice, of counsel from command,\r\nthe priests, prophets, or philosophers, who were the intellectual\r\nleaders of men, were reduced to that position of subordination in which\r\nalone they can concentrate their attention upon their proper work. For\r\nthe influences of the intellect, like those of the affections, must be\r\nindirect if they are to be pure. \"No power, especially if it be\r\ntheological, cares to modify the will, unless it finds itself powerless\r\nto control action.\"[35] But when the theoretic class were subordinated\r\nto the practical class, they became the natural allies of the women,\r\nand, like them, had to substitute counsel for command. At first, indeed,\r\ntheir subjection was too absolute, for the military aristocracies of\r\nGreece and Rome did not leave to the priesthood sufficient independence,\r\nor at least sufficient authority, to permit even of counsel. But with\r\nthe rise of Catholic Monotheism, supported as it was by a new revelation\r\nbased upon an incarnation of God, the separation of Church and State\r\nwas definitely established, and the intellectual life was put in its\r\nproper relation to the life of action.\r\n\r\nThe consequence is that the theological priesthood have continually\r\nsought to counteract the natural influences of their theological\r\ndoctrines by making additions which were inconsistent with its\r\n\"absolute\" principle, but which rendered it better fitted for the\r\npurpose of binding men together. This was especially the case under\r\nMonotheism, where, as we have seen, such counteraction was most\r\nnecessary. From this source arose a series of supplementary doctrines,\r\ngenerally tending to connect God with man, and men with each other. St.\r\nPaul, \"the real founder of Christianity,\" took the first step in\r\nreducing Monotheism into a shape in which it could act as an \"organic\"\r\ndoctrine, and his successors followed steadily in the same path. If the\r\nomnipotence of God raised him above all human sympathy, and tended to\r\ndestroy human sympathy in his worshippers, the doctrines of the Trinity\r\nand the Incarnation again brought him near to them, and taught them to\r\nreverence a humanity which was thus raised into unity with God. In the\r\nFeast of the Eucharist all men celebrated and enjoyed their unity with\r\nthis exalted and deified humanity. The same influence, in its further\r\ndevelopment, led to the adoration of the saints, and above all of the\r\nVirgin Mother, in whom Christian devotion really worshipped humanity, in\r\nits simplest and tenderest affections. Finally, if benevolent sympathies\r\nwere denied to nature, St. Paul found a place for them by attributing\r\nthem to grace, \"which Thomas à Kempis admirably defines as the\r\nequivalent of love--_gratia sive dilectio_--divine inspiration being\r\nsubstituted for human impulse.\"[36] And the struggle between egoism and\r\naltruism was expressed in the doctrines of the Fall and Redemption of\r\nmankind.[37] Thus the social passion, which, according to the theory,\r\ncould not be found in humanity, was conceived to flow from a divine\r\ninfluence, and became ennobled, at least as a means of salvation, in the\r\neyes of those who would otherwise have suppressed it. At the same time,\r\nas Comte also contends, these additions or corrections of the original\r\ndoctrine were inconsistent or imperfect in themselves, and inadequate to\r\nthe social purpose for which they were destined; and they naturally\r\ndisappeared whenever, by the emancipation of the intelligence, the\r\nimmense egoism, which Monotheism consecrated in God and favoured in man,\r\nwas let loose from the bonds in which the Church had confined it.\r\nProtestantism was the first indication of this change; for Protestantism\r\nis but an organized anarchy, in which the only elements of order are\r\nderived from an instinctive conservatism, clinging to the fragments of a\r\npast doctrinal system, which, in principle, has been abandoned. It\r\ncontains no organic elements of its own--no positive contribution to the\r\nprogressive life of humanity; it is simply the first imperfect result of\r\nthat metaphysical individualism which, in its ultimate form, freed from\r\nall the limits of the Catholic system, expressed itself theoretically\r\nin Rousseau and Voltaire, and practically in the French Revolution. The\r\nhope of mankind, however, lies in the new synthesis of Positivism, which\r\nalone can give due value to the innate altruistic sympathies of man, and\r\nwhich therefore alone can place on a permanent scientific basis that\r\nsocial order which the mediæval Church attempted in vain to found on the\r\nessentially egoistic and anarchic doctrine of Monotheism.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental conception, then, which underlies Comte's view of\r\nprogress is, that every past religion, with the partial exception of\r\nFetichism, has been an amalgam of two radically inconsistent elements,\r\none of which only was due to the theological principle itself; while the\r\nother was due, partly to the practical instinct of its priests, which\r\nled them to modify the logical results of that principle in conformity\r\nwith the social wants of man; and partly also to their subordinate\r\nposition, which obliged them to use the spiritual means of conviction\r\nand persuasion instead of the ruder weapons of material force. To\r\ncriticise fully this position would be to re-write Comte's history of\r\nreligion. It will be sufficient here to point out that his view of\r\nmodern history begins in a false interpretation of Christianity, and\r\nends in an equally false interpretation of the Protestant Reformation.\r\n\r\nChristianity from its origin has two aspects or elements; and if we\r\ncompare it with earlier religions, we may call these its Pantheistic and\r\nits Monotheistic elements. But these elements are not, as Comte asserts,\r\njoined together by a mere external necessity. They are necessarily\r\nconnected in the inner logic of the system; nor can we regard one of\r\nthem as more or less essential than the other. In the simplest words of\r\nthe Gospels we find already expressed a sense of reconciliation with\r\nGod, and therefore with the world and self, which is alien to pure\r\nMonotheism, though there is some faint anticipation of it in the later\r\nbooks of the Old Testament. For a spiritual Monotheism, while it awakens\r\na consciousness of the holiness of God, and the sinfulness of the\r\ncreature, tends to make fear prevail over love, and the sense of\r\nseparation over the sense of union. The idea of the unity of the Divine\r\nand the human--an original unity which yet has to be realized by\r\nself-sacrifice--and the corresponding idea that the individual or\r\nnatural life must be lost in order to save it, were set before humanity,\r\nas in one great living picture, in the life and death of Christ. And\r\nwhat was thus directly presented to the heart and the imagination in an\r\nindividual, was universalized in the writings of St. Paul and St. John:\r\nin other words, it was liberated from its peculiar national setting, and\r\nused as a key to the general moral history of man. The Messiah of the\r\nJews was exalted into the Divine Logos, and the Cross became the symbol\r\nof an atonement and reconciliation between God and man, which has been\r\nmade \"before the foundation of the world,\" yet which has to be made\r\nagain in every human life. The work of the first three centuries was to\r\ngive to this idea such logical expression as was then possible, in the\r\ndoctrines of the Incarnation and the Trinity. It is true that this idea\r\nof the unity of man with God was not immediately carried out to any of\r\nthe consequences which might seem to be contained in it. It remained for\r\na time a religion, and a religion only; it did not show itself to be the\r\nprinciple of a new social or political order of life. Rather it accepted\r\nthe old order represented by the Roman Empire, and even consecrated it\r\nas \"ordained of God,\" only demanding for itself that it should be\r\nallowed to purify the inner life of men. Such a separation of the things\r\nof Cæsar and the things of God was then inevitable; for it is impossible\r\nthat a new principle can ever be received simply and without alloy into\r\nminds, which are at the same time occupying themselves with its utmost\r\npractical or even theoretical consequences. In this sense there is great\r\ntruth in what Comte says about the value of the separation of the\r\nspiritual from the temporal authority. The power of directly realizing a\r\nnew religious principle, just because it draws away attention from the\r\nprinciple itself to the details of its practical application, is likely\r\nto prevent that application being either effective or even a true\r\nexpression of the principle. Such practical inferences cannot safely be\r\ndrawn by direct logical deduction; they will be made with certainty and\r\neffect only by spirits which the principle has remoulded. The decided\r\nwithdrawal of the Christian Church from the sphere of \"practical\r\npolitics\" was, therefore, not merely a necessity forced upon it from\r\nwithout; it was a condition which its best members gladly accepted,\r\nbecause without it the inner transformation of man's life by the new\r\ndoctrine would have been impossible. If Christianity had raised an\r\ninsurrection of slaves, it never could have put an end to slavery.\r\n\r\nBut while this withdrawal was necessary, it contained a great danger;\r\nfor the inner life cannot be separated from the outer life without\r\nbecoming narrowed and distorted. Confined to the sphere of religion and\r\nprivate morality, the doctrine of unity and reconciliation necessarily\r\nbecame itself the source of a new dualism. What had been at first merely\r\nneglect of the world was gradually changed into hostility to worldly\r\ninterests; and the germs of a positive morality, reconciling the flesh\r\nand the spirit--which appear in the New Testament--were neglected and\r\novershadowed in the growth of asceticism. Christianity, even in its\r\nfirst expression, had a negative side towards the natural life of man;\r\nwhile it lifted man to God, it yet taught that humanity \"cannot be\r\nquickened except it die.\" But the mediæval Church, while it constantly\r\ntaught that humanity in its desires and tendencies must die, had almost\r\nforgotten to hope that it could be quickened. Its highest morality--the\r\nmorality of the three vows--was the negation of all social obligations;\r\nits science was the interpretation of a fixed dogma received on\r\nauthority; its religion tended to become an external service, an _opus\r\noperatum_, a preparation for another world, rather than a principle of\r\naction in this. Its highest act of worship, the Eucharist, in which was\r\ncelebrated the revealed unity of men with each other and with God, was\r\nreserved in its fulness for the clergy, and even with them was finally\r\nreduced to an external act by the doctrine of transubstantiation, in\r\nwhich poetry \"became logic,\" and in becoming logic, ceased to be truth.\r\n\r\nNow, Comte, seeing the working of this negative tendency in mediæval\r\nCatholicism, and regarding it as the natural work of Monotheism, is\r\nobliged to treat all the positive side of Christianity as an external\r\naddition suggested by the practical wisdom of the clergy. St. Paul is\r\nsupposed by him to have invented (and Comte's language would ever\r\nsuggest that he consciously invented[38]) the doctrine of grace, in\r\norder to reconsecrate those social affections which Monotheism, in its\r\ncondemnation of nature, had either denied to exist, or, what is nearer\r\nthe truth, had treated as having no moral value. But this only shows how\r\nimperfectly Comte grasped the Pauline conception of the moral change\r\nwhich religion produces. The idea that the immediate untamed and\r\nundisciplined will of the natural man is not a principle of morality,\r\nand that therefore man must die to live, must rise above himself to be\r\nhimself, is one which has in it nothing discordant with the claims of\r\nsocial feeling. It is the commonplace of every powerful writer on\r\npractical ethics, from the Gospels to Thomas à Kempis, and from Luther\r\nto Goethe.\r\n\r\n  \"Und so lang du das nicht hast\r\n  Dies-es: Stirb und Werde,\r\n  Bist du nur ein trüber Gast\r\n  Auf der dunkeln Erde.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Paul adds that this death to self is possible only to him in whom\r\nanother than his own natural will lives; \"so then it is not I that live,\r\nbut Christ that liveth in me.\" Comte would probably accept the sentence\r\nwith the substitution of humanity for Christ. But either substitution\r\ninvolves the negation of the natural tendencies, whether individual or\r\nsocial, in their immediate natural form; and Comte himself, when he\r\nplaced not only the sexual but even the maternal impulse among those\r\nthat are merely \"personal,\" virtually acknowledged that the natural or\r\ninstinctive basis of the altruistic affections is not in itself\r\nmoral.[39] But because he begins with a psychology which treats the\r\negoistic and altruistic desires, and again the intellect and the heart,\r\nas distinct and independent entities, he is unable to do justice to an\r\naccount of moral experience which involves that they are essentially\r\nrelated elements in one whole, or necessarily connected stages of its\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIn the form in which it was first presented, the teaching of\r\nChristianity was undoubtedly ambiguous, as, indeed, every doctrine in\r\nits first general and abstract form must be. We cannot then call it\r\neither social or anti-social, without limitations; it is anti-social and\r\nascetic, because of its negative relations to the previous forms of life\r\nand culture; it is social and positive in so far as in its primary\r\ndoctrine of the unity of the divine and human--of divinity manifested\r\nin man and humanity made perfect through suffering--it contains the\r\npromise and the necessity of a development by which nature and spirit\r\nshall be reconciled. The progressive tendency of Christendom was based\r\non the fact that from the earliest times the followers of Christ were\r\nplaced in the dilemma, either of denying their primary doctrine of\r\nreconciliation between God and man and going back to pure Monotheism, or\r\nof advancing to the reconciliation of all those other antagonisms of\r\nspirit and nature, the world and the Church, which arose out of the\r\ncircumstances of its first publication. And modern history is more than\r\nanything else the history of the long process whereby this logical\r\nnecessity manifested itself in fact. The negative spirit of the Middle\r\nAge, its asceticism, its dualism, its formalism, its tendency to\r\ntransform the moral opposition of natural and spiritual into an external\r\nopposition between two natural worlds, present and future, and thus to\r\nsubstitute \"other-worldliness\" for worldliness, instead of substituting\r\nunworldliness for both--all these characteristics were the natural\r\nresults of the fact that the idea of Christianity, in its first abstract\r\nform, could not include, and therefore necessarily became opposed to,\r\nthe forms of social life and organization with which it came into\r\ncontact. But while the early Christians looked for the realization of\r\nthe kingdom of Heaven in some immediate earthly future, and the Middle\r\nAge postponed it to another life, Christ had already taught the truth,\r\nwhich alone can turn either of these hopes into something more than the\r\nexpression of an egoistic desire--the truth that \"the kingdom of God is\r\nwithin us.\" The reaction of the social necessities of mediæval society\r\non the doctrine--which Comte quite correctly describes as leading to the\r\ngradual elevation of humanity and of human interests--found its main\r\nsupport in the principles of the doctrine itself, so soon as its lessons\r\nhad been absorbed into the mind of the people. The irresistible force of\r\nthe movement, whereby the intelligence was emancipated from authority,\r\nand the claims of the family and the State were asserted against the\r\nChurch, lay above all in this, that Christianity itself was felt to\r\ninvolve the consecration of human life in all its interests and\r\nrelations. Luther's appeal to the New Testament and to the earliest ages\r\nof Christianity was in some ways unhistorical, but it expressed a truth.\r\nProtestantism was not a return to the Christianity of the first century;\r\nit was an assertion of the relation of the individual to God, which was\r\nitself made possible only by the long work of Latin Catholicism. But the\r\ndevelopment of a doctrine, if it has in it any germ of truth which is\r\ncapable of development, involves a continual recurrence to its first,\r\nand therefore its most general, expression. The elements successively\r\ndeveloped in the Catholic and the Protestant, the Latin and the Germanic\r\nforms of Christianity, were both present in the original germ, and the\r\nexaggerated prominence given in the former to the _negative_ side of\r\nChristianity could not but lead, in the development of thought, to a\r\nsimilarly exaggerated manifestation of its _positive_ side. But it is\r\nnearly as absurd to say, as Comte does, that the true logical outcome of\r\nChristianity is to be found in the \"life of the hermits of the Thebaid,\"\r\nas it would be to say that its true logical outcome is to be found in\r\nthose vehement assertions of nature--naked and unashamed--as its own\r\nsufficient warrant, which poured almost with the force of inspiration\r\nfrom the lips of Diderot. Both extremes are equally removed from that\r\nspecial moral temper and tone of feeling which we can alone call\r\nChristian--the former by its want of sympathy and tenderness, no less\r\nthan the latter by its want of purity and self-command. Reassertion of\r\nnature through its negation, or to put it more simply, the purification\r\nof the natural desires by the renunciation of their immediate\r\ngratification, is the idea that is more or less definitely present in\r\nall phases of the history of Christianity; and, though swaying from one\r\nside to the other, the religious life of modern times has never ceased\r\nto present both aspects. Even a St. Augustine recoiled from the\r\nManichæism by which nature was regarded, not simply as fallen from its\r\noriginal idea, but as essentially impure. And, on the other hand, even\r\nRousseau's Savoyard vicar, who has got rid of the negative or ascetic\r\nelement, as completely as is possible for any one still retaining any\r\ntincture of Christianity or even of religion, and who insists so\r\nstrongly on the text that \"the natural is the moral,\" is yet forced to\r\nrecognize that nature has two voices, and that the _raison commune_ has\r\nto overcome and transform the natural inclinations of the individual. In\r\nthe life of its Founder, the Christian Church has always had before it\r\nan individual type of that harmony of the spiritual and natural life,\r\nwhich it is its ideal to realize in all the wider spiritual relations of\r\nman; nor, till that ideal is reached, can it be said that the Christian\r\nidea is exhausted, or that the place is vacant for a new religion,\r\nhowever great may be the changes of form and expression through which\r\nChristianity must pass under the changed conditions of modern life.\r\n\r\nThat Comte was not able to discern this, arose, as we have seen, from\r\nthe fact that he held a kind of Manichæism of his own. To him the\r\negoistic and altruistic desires were two kinds of innate tendencies,\r\nboth of which exist in man from the first, though with a great\r\npreponderance on the side of egoism. Moral improvement simply consists\r\nin altering the original proportions in favour of altruism, and moral\r\nperfection would be the complete extinction of egoism (which with Comte\r\nwould naturally mean the extinction of all the desires classified as\r\npersonal). Hence there is a distinctly ascetic tendency in some of the\r\nprecepts of the _Politique Positive_,--_i.e._, asceticism begins to\r\nappear, not simply as a transitionary process through which certain\r\nnatural desires are to be purified, but as a deliberate attempt to\r\nextinguish them. A deeper analysis would have shown that the desires in\r\nthemselves, as mere natural impulses, are neither egoistic nor\r\naltruistic, neither bad nor good; and that while, as they appear in the\r\nconscious life, they are necessarily at first poisoned with egoism, yet\r\nthat the _ego_ is not absolutely opposed to the _alter ego_, but rather\r\nimplies it. A spiritual or self-conscious being is one who can find\r\nhimself, nay who can find himself only, in the life of others: and when\r\nhe does so find himself, there is no natural desire which for itself he\r\nneeds to renounce as impure; no natural desire which may not become the\r\nexpression of the better self, which is _ego_ and _alter ego_ in one.\r\nBut Comte, unable from the limitations of his psychology to see the true\r\nrelation of the negative and the positive side of ethics, is obliged to\r\ntreat the ascetic tendency of Christianity as involving a denial of the\r\nexistence, or the moral value, of the social sympathies; and on the\r\nother hand, to regard the efforts of the Christian Church to cultivate\r\nthose sympathies, as the result of an external accommodation. His view\r\nof Christianity, in short, practically coincides with the definition of\r\nvirtue given by Paley; it is \"doing good to man, in obedience to the\r\nwill of God, with a view to eternal happiness.\" It is the pursuit of a\r\nselfish end by means in themselves unselfish, with the pleasures and\r\npains of another world introduced as the link of connection; and it must\r\ntherefore leave bare selfishness in its place, so soon as doubt is cast\r\nupon these supernatural rewards and punishments. Hence Comte is just\r\nneither to Catholicism nor to Protestantism; considering that the former\r\nwas only _indirectly_ social, and that the latter is merely the first\r\nstep in a scepticism which, taking away the fears and hopes of another\r\nworld, must at the same time take away the last limit upon selfishness.\r\nAnd, just because he is unable to understand either the negative\r\ntendencies of the former, or the positive tendencies of the latter,\r\nphase of modern life, he has an imperfect appreciation of that social\r\nideal to which both are leading, and which must combine in itself the\r\ntrue elements of both. As, however, it is the temptation of writers on\r\nsocial subjects to be least just to the tendencies of the time which\r\npreceded their own, and against whose errors they have immediately to\r\ncontend, so we find that Comte is fairer towards Catholicism than he is\r\ntowards Protestantism, or towards that individualism which grew out of\r\nProtestantism, and which he is pleased to call Metaphysics. The latter\r\nhe sees solely on their destructive side, as successive stages in the\r\nmodern movement of revolt, without appreciating the constructive\r\nelements involved in them. Hence also he is led, in his attitude towards\r\nthis great movement, to all but identify himself with Catholic writers\r\nlike De Maistre; and his own scheme of the future is essentially\r\nreactionary. The restoration of the spiritual power to its mediæval\r\nposition was a natural proposal for one who saw in the Protestant revolt\r\nnothing more than an insurrectionary movement, which might clear the way\r\nfor a new social construction, but which in itself was the negation of\r\nall government whatever.\r\n\r\nFor what was Protestantism? To the Protestant it seemed to be simply a\r\nreturn to the original purity of the Christian faith; to the Catholic,\r\nit seemed to be a fatal revolt against the only organization by which\r\nChristianity could be realized. Really it partook of both characters. It\r\ninvolved at once a dangerous misconception of the social conditions,\r\nunder which alone the religious life can be realized and developed, and\r\na deeper and truer apprehension of that religion, which first recognized\r\nthe latent divinity or universal capacity of every spiritual being as\r\nsuch, and which, therefore, seemed to impose upon every individual man\r\nthe right or rather the duty of living by the witness of his own spirit.\r\nComte saw only the former of these aspects of it. Hence he regarded the\r\nFrench Revolution as a practical refutation of the individualism which\r\ngrew out of the Protestant movement, and not, as it was in truth, a\r\ncritical event, which should force men to distinguish and separate its\r\ntrue and its false elements. And he drew from it the lesson that the\r\nindividual has no moral or religious life of his own, but that it is\r\nonly in proportion as he transcends his own individuality and lives the\r\nlife of humanity, that his own spiritual life can have any depth or\r\nriches in it. Like Burke he could say, \"We are afraid to put men to live\r\nand trade each on his own private stock of reason, because we suspect\r\nthat the stock in each man is small, and that the individuals would do\r\nbetter to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations\r\nand of ages.\" But because he discerned this, he regarded the effort of\r\nProtestantism to throw individuals back upon themselves as merely\r\ntending to empty their minds of all valuable contents, and to deliver\r\nthem over to their own individual caprice. Private judgment and popular\r\ngovernment are to him only other forms of expression for intellectual\r\nand political anarchy; and his remedy for the moral diseases of modern\r\ntimes is the restoration of that division of the spiritual and temporal\r\nauthorities, which existed in the Middle Ages. But there is another\r\naspect of the Protestant movement and of these apparently anarchical\r\ndoctrines, to which Comte pays no attention. Catholicism, as we have\r\nseen, had developed one aspect of Christianity, until, by its exclusive\r\nprominence, the principle of Christianity itself was on the point of\r\nbeing lost. It had changed the opposition of laity and clergy, world and\r\nChurch, from a relative into an absolute one; it had presented its\r\ndoctrine, not as something which the spirit of the individual may\r\nultimately verify for itself, but as something to which it must\r\npermanently submit without any verification. It had made the worship\r\ninto an _opus operatum_ instead of a means through which the feelings of\r\nthe worshipper could be at once drawn out and expressed. Now, it is as\r\nopposed to these tendencies that the Protestant movement had its highest\r\nimportance. It would, no doubt, be intellectual anarchy, for every\r\nindividual to claim to judge for himself, on subjects for which he has\r\nnot the requisite training or discipline; but it is a slavery scarcely\r\nless corrupting in its effect than anarchy, when he is made to regard\r\nthe difference between himself and his teachers as a permanent and\r\nabsolute one. In the former case, he has no sufficient feeling of his\r\nwant to make him duly submissive to teaching; in the latter, he has no\r\nsufficient consciousness of his capacity to awake a due reaction of his\r\nthought upon the matter received from his teachers. Again, the decline\r\nof the sovereignty of the people would be the negation of all rule, if\r\nit meant that the uninstructed many should govern themselves by their\r\nown insight, and that the instructed few should simply be their servants\r\nand their instruments. But where the people are not recognized as the\r\nultimate source of power, where their consent is not in any regular way\r\nmade necessary to the proceedings of their governors, they are by that\r\nvery fact kept in a perpetual tutelage, and cannot possibly feel that\r\nthe life of the State is their own life. Now, the most important effect\r\nof the Protestant movement was just this, that it awakened in each\r\nindividual the consciousness of his universal nature, in other words the\r\nconsciousness that there is no external power or sovereignty, divine or\r\nhuman, to which he has absolutely and permanently to submit, but that\r\nevery outward claim of authority must ultimately be justified by the\r\ninner witness of the spirit. The freedom of man is that his obedience to\r\nthe State, to the Church, even to God, is the obedience of his natural\r\nto his spiritual self. The essential truth of the Reformation lay in its\r\nrepublication of the doctrine that the voice of God speaks within and\r\nnot only without us, and indeed that \"it is only by the God within that\r\nwe can comprehend the God without.\" And the nations, which had learned\r\nthat lesson in religion, soon hastened to apply it to the social and\r\npolitical order of life. It is undoubtedly a dangerous lesson, as may be\r\nseen, not only in the tendency of many Protestant sects to put the inner\r\nlife in opposition to the outer, and so to deprive the former of all\r\nwider contents and interests; but also in the ultimate substitution, by\r\nRousseau and others, of the assertion of the natural, for the assertion\r\nof the spiritual, man. In such extreme cases we find the mere _capacity_\r\nof man for a higher life treated as if it were the higher life itself;\r\nforgetting that the capacity is nothing unless it be realized, and that\r\nits realization requires the surrender of individual liberty and private\r\njudgment to the guidance and teaching of those, in whom that realization\r\nhas already taken place. But it is not the less true that the\r\nconsciousness of the capacity, and the consequent sense of the duty of\r\nbecoming, not merely a slave or instrument, but an organ, of the\r\nintellectual and moral life of mankind, is the essential basis of modern\r\nlife. \"Henceforth, I call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not\r\nwhat his lord doeth; but I have called you friends,\" is a word of Christ\r\nwhich scarcely began to be verified till the Reformation. And while its\r\nverification cannot mean the negation of that division of labour upon\r\nwhich society rests,--cannot mean that each one should _know_ and\r\n_judge_, any more than that each one should _do_, everything for\r\nhimself,--it at least means that every power and authority should\r\nhenceforth be, in the true sense of the word, spiritual, and rest for\r\nits main support upon the opinion of those who obey it. It is because he\r\nhas not appreciated this truth that Comte so decidedly breaks with the\r\ndemocratic spirit of modern times, and seeks to set up an aristocracy in\r\nthe State and a monarchy in the Church. Yet the spirit of the age is,\r\nafter all, too strong for him, and while he refuses to the governed any\r\nregular and legitimate way of reacting upon the powers that govern them,\r\nhe recognizes that the _ultima ratio_, the final remedy for\r\nmisgovernment, lies in their irregular and illegitimate action. As\r\nregards the State, he declares that \"the right of insurrection is the\r\nultimate resource with which no society should allow itself to\r\ndispense.\"[40] And as regards the Church he says that if \"the High\r\nPriest of Humanity, supported by the body of the clergy, should go\r\nwrong, then the only remedy left would be the refusal of co-operation, a\r\nremedy which can never fail, as the priesthood rests solely on\r\nconscience and opinion, and succumbs, therefore, to their adverse\r\nsentence.\" The civil government, in fact, can bring the spiritual power\r\nto a dead-lock, by \"suspending its stipend, for in cases of serious\r\nerror, popular subscriptions would not replace it, unless on the\r\nsupposition of a fanaticism scarcely compatible with the Positive faith,\r\nwhere there is enthusiasm for the doctrines, rather than for the\r\nteachers.\"[41] Comte also desiderates among the proletariate a strong\r\nreactive influence of public opinion, by which the officers, both of\r\nChurch and State, are to be kept to their work. But if this is\r\ndesirable, why should the proletariate have no regular means of making\r\ntheir will felt? An \"organic\" theory of the constitution of society must\r\nsurely provide every real force with a legitimate form of expression; if\r\na social theory embodies the idea of revolution in it, it is\r\nself-condemned.\r\n\r\nComte's social ideal is in many respects a close reproduction of the\r\nmediæval system, with its _régime dispersif_ of feudalism in secular\r\npolitics, and its concentration of Papal authority in the Church. For\r\nhim, the growth of national States to their present dimensions, and, on\r\nthe other hand, the increasing division of labour in the realm of\r\nthought, are equally steps in the wrong direction. Still more strongly,\r\nif possible, does he reprobate that interference of the State with\r\nspiritual matters, such as the education of the people and its religious\r\nlife, which has been the natural consequence of the failure of the\r\nmediæval Church to maintain its old authority. Notwithstanding his\r\nworship of humanity, the idea of a \"parliament of man, a federation of\r\nthe world,\" by which all the powers of mankind should be united for the\r\nattainment of the highest material and spiritual good, has no attraction\r\nfor him. To reduce the State to the dimensions of a commune, and to\r\nconfine it to the care of purely material interests, is his first\r\npolitical proposal. France, England, and Spain (and we may now add\r\nGermany and Italy) are, in his view, \"factitious aggregates without\r\nsolid justification,\" and they will only become \"free and durable\r\nStates,\" when they are broken up into fragments, each with a population\r\nof two or three millions, and a territory not exceeding that of Belgium\r\nor Tuscany. The \"West\" will thus be divided into seventy republics, and\r\nthe earth into five hundred, and the main work of the patriciate will be\r\nto direct and regulate the industrial life of the community; each member\r\nof the banker triumvirate, who are to be at the head of the State,\r\nhaving one of the great industrial departments under his special\r\nsuperintendence. On the other hand the unity of humanity is to be\r\nrepresented solely by the spiritual power, in whose hands is to be left\r\nthe whole work of extending science, teaching the people, and exercising\r\na moral censorship over all Governments and individuals. And while this\r\nspiritual power is, for practical purposes, to be strictly organized on\r\nthe model of the mediæval Church, it is also, like that Church, to\r\nremain, for scientific purposes, inorganic. In other words, it is to\r\nadmit no scientific division of labour, but every one, like a mediæval\r\ndoctor, is to profess all science, adding to this the priestly office,\r\nwhich, with Comte, includes both the cure of souls and of bodies.\r\n\r\nTo criticize the details of this scheme seems to be unnecessary after\r\nwhat has been already said. It is not to be denied that the division of\r\nChurch and State in the Middle Age was a most important and even\r\nnecessary condition of progress. Christianity could never have been\r\nimpressed upon the minds of men, if its concrete application and\r\ndevelopment had been too rapid. The essential condition of such\r\ndevelopment was that men should not concern themselves too prematurely\r\nwith it. For the consequences of a moral and religious principle cannot\r\nbe reached by direct logical deductions; it is like a living germ, in\r\nwhich, by no analysis or dissection, you can discover the lineaments of\r\nthe future plant. To know what it really is, or involves, you must plant\r\nit in the minds of men, and let it grow. Hence the mediæval Church was\r\nstrong in its weakness, and it was its very victories over the temporal\r\npower that were its greatest danger. It became corrupt and lost its hold\r\nupon the minds of men, just when it seemed to have established its right\r\nto an absolute supremacy. Comte, following De Maistre, attaches great\r\nimportance to the position of the Popes as arbiters between the\r\nSovereigns and nations of mediæval Europe. But he forgets that, in\r\nclaiming and maintaining this position the Popes were distinctly ceasing\r\nto be a spiritual power, if it be the function of a spiritual power to\r\ninculcate principles rather than to use them to solve present\r\ndifficulties. A power interfering in this way with the immediate\r\nstruggle of interests, could not but be invaded by the passions they\r\nexcite, and it was the more certain to be corrupted by these passions,\r\nbecause it conceived them to be evil, and pretended altogether to\r\nrenounce them. The mediæval authority of the Church might have its\r\nvalue, as an anticipation of the peaceful federation of the nations\r\nunder one supreme Government, but it was at the same time the first\r\nstep towards the erasing of the distinction between the temporal and the\r\nspiritual power.\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be that the distinction, of secular and spiritual\r\npowers, except in the sense already indicated, is essentially\r\nirrational, and that the attempt to realise it in practice must involve,\r\nas it did involve in the Middle Ages, a continual internecine struggle.\r\nTo set up two regularly constituted powers face to face with each other,\r\none claiming man's allegiance in the name of his spiritual, and the\r\nother in the name of his temporal, interests, is to organize anarchy. So\r\nlong as man's body and soul are inseparable, it will be impossible to\r\ndivide the world between Cæsar and God; for in one point of view all is\r\nCæsar's, and in another all is God's. In the Middle Ages the conflict of\r\ntwo despotisms was necessary to the growth of freedom; but, when\r\ngovernment ceases to be despotic, the need for such division of power\r\npasses away. The relative separation between the speculative and the\r\npractical classes--between the scientific and moral teachers of mankind,\r\non the one hand, and the statesmen or administrators who have to\r\ndiscover what immediate changes in the organization of life have become\r\nnecessary, on the other--is a division of labour which can surely be\r\nattained without breaking up the unity of the social body. It is not\r\ndesirable that the philosopher, or priest, or man of science, should be\r\nking--and we may even acknowledge that if he were king he would probably\r\nbe a very bad one;--on the other hand, it is desirable that he should\r\nhave his due influence, as the teacher of those general truths out of\r\nwhich all practical improvement must ultimately spring. But the natural\r\ndifference of the tastes and capacities of men should, in a\r\nwell-organized State, be sufficient to secure due influence to those who\r\nare the natural representatives of man's spiritual interests (whether\r\nthey be religious, philosophic, or scientific), without tempting them\r\nfrom their proper task of discovering and teaching the truth, to the\r\nless appropriate work of determining how much of it comes within \"the\r\nsphere of practical politics.\" Comte, indeed, by organizing them as an\r\nindependent power apart from, and outside of, the State, would make such\r\na perversion extremely probable. A hierarchy of priests, under a\r\ndespotic Pope, would soon cease to be, in any sense, a spiritual power;\r\nand this would be only the more certain if, by the Comtist denunciation\r\nof specialism, they were prohibited from any division of labour\r\naccording to capacity in their own peculiar sphere of scientific\r\nresearch. For by this prohibition their attention would be drawn more\r\nand more from the truth of their doctrines to their immediate practical\r\neffects, not to mention that, in the case of all but a few comprehensive\r\nminds, the natural result would be an omniscient superficiality, which\r\nwould be the enemy of all real culture. For he who knows one thing well\r\nmay find the whole in the part; but he who knows the whole\r\nsuperficially, inevitably reduces it to the level of something partial\r\nand subjective. Deprived of its natural aim, the Comtist Church of the\r\nfuture would inevitably throw itself, with all its energy, into the task\r\nof directly influencing the practical life of men, and there it would\r\nfind itself in the presence of a number of communal States, none of them\r\nlarge enough to offer any effective resistance. Positivism must indeed\r\nalter human nature, if such a priesthood would not seek to make itself\r\ndespotic, especially if it could wield such a formidable weapon as the\r\nPositivist excommunication is supposed to be.[42]\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Comte commits the same error which misled Montesquieu\r\nand his followers, when they supposed that the great security of a free\r\nState lay in the separation of the legislative, executive, and judicial\r\npowers,--_i.e._, in treating the different organs through which the\r\ncommon life expresses itself as if they were independent organisms. In\r\ndoing so, they forgot that, if such a balance of power was realised, the\r\neffect must either be an equilibrium in which all movement must cease,\r\nor a struggle in which the unity of the State would be in danger of\r\nbeing lost. The true security against the dangers involved, on the one\r\nhand, in the direct application of theory to practice, and, on the other\r\nhand, in the separation of practice from theory, must lie, not in giving\r\nthem independent positions as spiritual and temporal powers, but in the\r\norganic unity of the society--communal, national, or, if it may be,\r\nuniversal--to which the representatives of both belong. And organic\r\nunity, though it does not mean any special form of government, means at\r\nleast two things: in the first place, that each great class or interest\r\nshould have for itself a definite organ, and should therefore be able to\r\nact on the whole body in a regular and constitutional manner, so as to\r\nshow all its force without revolutionary violence; and, in the second\r\nplace, that no class or interest should have such an independent\r\nposition, that there is no legal or constitutional method of bringing it\r\ninto due subordination. But Comte, losing his balance in his jealousy of\r\nthe individualistic and democratic movement of modern society, has built\r\nup a social ideal, which fails in both these points of view. And he is\r\nconsequently obliged, against his will, to contemplate revolution and\r\nwar as necessary resources of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt would not be fair to conclude these articles, which have necessarily\r\nbeen devoted in great part to criticism and controversy, without\r\nexpressing a sense of the power and insight which are shown in the works\r\nof Comte, especially in the _Politique Positive_. Controversy itself, it\r\nmust be remembered, is a kind of homage; for, as Hegel says, \"It is only\r\na great man that condemns us to the task of explaining him.\" But if we\r\ncan sometimes look down upon such men, it becomes us to remember that we\r\nstand upon their shoulders. Comte seems to me to occupy, as a writer, a\r\nposition in some degree similar to that of Kant. He stands, or rather\r\nmoves, between the old world and the new, and is broken into\r\ninconsistency by the effort of transition. Like Kant, he is embarrassed\r\nto the end by the ideas with which he started, and of which he can\r\nnever free himself so as to make a new beginning. Comte had only a small\r\nportion of that power of speculative analysis which characterized his\r\ngreat predecessor, but he had much of his tenacity of thought, his power\r\nof continuous construction; and he had the same conviction of the\r\nall-importance of morals, and the same determination to make all his\r\ntheoretic studies subordinate to the solution of the moral problem.\r\nAlso, partly because he lived at a later time, and in the midst of a\r\nsociety which was in the throes of a social revolution, and partly\r\nbecause of the keenness and strength of his own social sympathies, he\r\ngives us a kind of insight into the diseases and wants of modern\r\nsociety, which we could not expect from Kant, and which throws new light\r\nupon the ethical speculations of Kant's idealistic successors. To\r\nbelieve that his system, as a whole, is inconsistent with itself, that\r\nhis theory of historical progress is insufficient, and that his social\r\nideal is imperfect, need not prevent us from recognizing that there are\r\nmany valuable elements in his historical and social theories, and that\r\nno one who would study such subjects can afford to neglect them. A mind\r\nof such power cannot treat any subject without throwing much light upon\r\nit, which is independent of his special system of thought, and, above\r\nall, without doing much to show what are the really important\r\ndifficulties in it which need to be solved. And, especially in such\r\nsubjects, to discover the right question is to be half-way to the\r\nanswer. Further, as Comte himself somewhere says, it is an immense\r\nadvantage in studying any complex subject to have before us a distinct\r\nand systematic attempt to explain it; for it is only by criticism upon\r\ncriticism that we can expect to reach the truth, in which all its varied\r\nsides and aspects are brought to a unity.\r\n\r\n  EDWARD CAIRD.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] \"Comte and Positivism,\" p. 140.\r\n\r\n[27] \"The Unity of Comte's Life and Doctrine,\" p. 28.\r\n\r\n[28] Pol.

I followed\r\nchiefly a line of _à priori_ reasoning, considering how herdsmen and\r\ntillers of the soil would be apt at a very early period to use the moon\r\nas a means of measuring time, and how in endeavouring so to use her they\r\nwould almost of necessity be led to employ special methods of\r\nsubdividing the period during which she passes through her various\r\nphases. But while each step of the reasoning was thus based on _à\r\npriori_ considerations, its validity was tested by the evidence which\r\nhas reached us respecting the various methods employed by different\r\nnations of antiquity for following the moon's motions. It appears to me\r\nthat the conclusions to which this method of reasoning led were more\r\nsatisfactory, because more trustworthy, than those which have been\r\nreached respecting the week by the mere study of various traditions\r\nwhich have reached us respecting the early use of this widespread time\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nI now propose to apply a somewhat similar method to a problem which has\r\nalways been regarded as at once highly interesting and very difficult,\r\nthe question of the purpose for which the pyramids of Egypt, and\r\nespecially the pyramids of Ghizeh, were erected. But I do not here take\r\nthe full problem under consideration. I have, indeed, elsewhere dealt\r\nwith it in a general manner, and have been led to a theory respecting\r\nthe pyramids which will be touched on towards the close of the present\r\npaper. Here, however, I intend to deal only with one special part of the\r\nproblem, that part to which alone the method I propose to employ is\r\napplicable--the question of the astronomical purpose which the pyramids\r\nwere intended to subserve. It will be understood, therefore, why I have\r\nspoken of applying a somewhat similar method, and not a precisely\r\nsimilar method; to the problem of the pyramids. For whereas in dealing\r\nwith the origin of the week, I could from the very beginning of the\r\ninquiry apply the _à priori_ method, I cannot do so in the case of the\r\npyramids. I do not know of any line of _à priori_ reasoning by which it\r\ncould be proved, or even rendered probable, that any race of men, of\r\nwhatever proclivities or avocations, would naturally be led to construct\r\nbuildings resembling the pyramids. If it could be, of course that line\r\nof reasoning would at the same time indicate what purposes such\r\nbuildings were intended to subserve. Failing evidence of this kind, we\r\nmust follow at first the _à posteriori_ method; and this method, while\r\nit is clear enough as to the construction of pyramids, for there are the\r\npyramids themselves to speak unmistakably on this point, is not\r\naltogether so clear as to any one of the purposes for which the pyramids\r\nwere built.\r\n\r\nYet I think that if there is one purpose among possibly many which the\r\nbuilders of the pyramids had in their thoughts, which can be\r\nunmistakably inferred from the pyramids themselves, independently of all\r\ntraditions, it is the purpose of constructing edifices which should\r\nenable men to observe the heavenly bodies in some way not otherwise\r\nobtainable. If the orienting of the faces of the pyramids had been\r\neffected in some such way as the orienting of most of our cathedrals and\r\nchurches--_i.e._, in a manner quite sufficiently exact as tested by\r\nordinary observation, but not capable of bearing astronomical tests,--it\r\nmight reasonably enough be inferred that having to erect square\r\nbuildings for any purpose whatever, men were likely enough to set them\r\nfour-square to the cardinal points, and that, therefore, no stress\r\nwhatever can be laid on this feature of the pyramids' construction. But\r\nwhen we find that the orienting of the pyramids has been effected with\r\nextreme care, that in the case of the great pyramid, which is the\r\ntypical edifice of this kind, the orienting bears well the closest\r\nastronomical scrutiny, we cannot doubt that this feature indicates an\r\nastronomical purpose as surely as it indicates the use of astronomical\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nBut while we thus start with what is to some degree an assumption, with\r\nwhat at any rate is not based on _à priori_ considerations, yet\r\nmanifestly we may expect to find evidence as we proceed which shall\r\neither strengthen our opinion on this point, or show it to be unsound.\r\nWe are going to make this astronomical purpose the starting-point for a\r\nseries of _à priori_ considerations, each to be tested by whatever\r\ndirect evidence may be available; and it is practically certain that if\r\nwe have thus started in an entirely wrong direction, we shall before\r\nlong find out our mistake. At least we shall do so, if we start with the\r\ndesire to find out as much of the truth as we can, and not with the\r\ndetermination to see only those facts which point in the direction along\r\nwhich we have set out, overlooking any which seem to point in a\r\ndifferent direction. We need not necessarily be in the wrong track\r\nbecause of such seeming indications. If we are on the right track, we\r\nshall see things more clearly as we proceed; and it may be that evidence\r\nwhich at first seems to accord ill with the idea that we are progressing\r\ntowards the truth, may be found among the most satisfactory evidence\r\nobtainable. But we must in any case note such evidence, even at the time\r\nwhen it seems to suggest that we are on the wrong track. We may push on,\r\nnevertheless, to see how such evidence appears a little later. But we\r\nmust by no means forget its existence. So only can we hope to reach the\r\ntruth or a portion of the truth, instead of merely making out a good\r\ncase for some particular theory.\r\n\r\nWe start, then, with the assumption that the great pyramid, called the\r\nPyramid of Cheops, was built for this purpose, _inter alia_, to enable\r\nmen to make certain astronomical observations with great accuracy; and\r\nwhat we propose to do is to inquire what would be done by men having\r\nthis purpose in view, having, as the pyramid builders had, (1) a fine\r\nastronomical site, (2) the command of enormous wealth, (3) practically\r\nexhaustless stores of material, and (4) the means of compelling many\r\nthousands of men to labour for them.\r\n\r\nWatching the celestial bodies hour by hour, day by day, and year by\r\nyear, the observer recognizes certain regions of the heavens which\r\nrequire special attention, and certain noteworthy directions both with\r\nrespect to the horizon and to elevation above the horizon.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the observer perceives that the stars, which are in many\r\nrespects the most conveniently observable bodies, are carried round, as\r\nif they were rigidly attached to a hollow sphere, carried around an axis\r\npassing through the station of the observer (as through a centre) and\r\ndirected towards a certain point in the dome of the heavens. That point,\r\nthen, is one whose direction must not only be ascertained, but must be\r\nin some way or other indicated. Whatever the nature of an astronomer's\r\ninstruments or observatory, whether he have but a few simple\r\ncontrivances in a structure of insignificant proportions, or the most\r\nperfect instruments in a noble edifice of most exquisite construction\r\nand of the utmost attainable stability, he must in every case have the\r\nposition of the pole of the heavens clearly indicated in some way or\r\nother. Now, the pole of the heavens is a point lying due north, at a\r\ncertain definite elevation above the horizon. Thus the first\r\nconsideration to be attended to by the builder of any sort of\r\nastronomical observatory, is the determination of the direction of the\r\ntrue north (or the laying down of a true north-and-south line), while\r\nthe second is the determination, and in some way or other the indication\r\nof the angle of elevation above the north point, at which the true pole\r\nof the heavens may lie.\r\n\r\nTo get the true north-and-south line, however, the astronomer would be\r\napt at first, perhaps, rather to make mid-day observations than to\r\nobserve the stars at night. It would have been the observation of these\r\nwhich first called his attention to the existence of a definite point\r\nround which all the stars seem to be carried in parallel circles; but he\r\nwould very quickly notice that the sun and the moon, and also the five\r\nplanets, are carried round the same polar axis, only differing from the\r\nstars in this: that, besides being thus carried round with the celestial\r\nsphere, they also move upon that sphere, though with a motion which is\r\nvery slow compared with that which they derive from the seeming motion\r\nof the sphere itself. Now, among these bodies the sun and moon possess a\r\ndistinct advantage over the stars. A body illuminated by either the sun\r\nor the moon throws a shadow, and thus if we place an upright pointed rod\r\nin sunlight or moonlight, and note where the shadow of the point lies,\r\nwe know that a straight line from the point to the shadow of the point\r\nis directed exactly towards the sun or the moon, as the case may be.\r\nLeaving the moon aside as in other respects unsuitable, for she only\r\nshines with suitable lustre in one part of each month, we have in the\r\nsun's motions a means of getting the north-and-south line by thus noting\r\nthe position of the shadow of a pointed upright. For being carried\r\naround an inclined axis directed northwards, the sun is, of course,\r\nbrought to his greatest elevation on any given day when due south. So\r\nthat if we note when the shadow of an upright is shortest on any day, we\r\nknow that at that moment the sun is at his highest or due south; and the\r\nline joining the centre of the upright's base with the end of the shadow\r\nat that instant lies due north-and-south.\r\n\r\nBut though theoretically this method is sufficient, it is open, in\r\npractice, to a serious objection. The sun's elevation, when he is nearly\r\nat his highest, changes very slowly; so that it is difficult to\r\ndetermine the precise moment when the shadow is shortest. But the\r\ndirection of the shadow is steadily changing all the time that we thus\r\nremain in doubt whether the sun's elevation has reached its maximum or\r\nnot. We are apt, then, to make an error as to time, which will result in\r\na noteworthy error as to the direction of the north-and-south line.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, it would be better for any one employing this shadow\r\nmethod to take two epochs on either side of solar noon, when the sun was\r\nat exactly the same elevation, or the shadow of exactly the same\r\nlength,--determining this by striking out a circle around the foot of\r\nthe upright, and observing where the shadow's point crossed this circle\r\nbefore noon in drawing nearer to the base, and after noon in passing\r\naway from the base. These two intersections with the circle necessarily\r\nlie at equal distances from the north-and-south line, which can thus be\r\nmore exactly determined than by the other method, simply because the end\r\nof the shadow crosses the circle traced on the ground at moments which\r\ncan be more exactly determined than the moment when the shadow is\r\nshortest.\r\n\r\nNow, we notice in this description of methods which unquestionably were\r\nfollowed by the very earliest astronomers, one circumstance which\r\nclearly points to a feature as absolutely essential in every\r\nastronomical observing station. (I do not say \"observatory,\" for I am\r\nspeaking just now of observations so elementary that the word would be\r\nout of place.) The observer must have a perfectly flat floor on which to\r\nreceive the shadow of the upright pointer. And not only must the floor\r\nbe flat, but it must also be perfectly horizontal. At any rate, it must\r\nnot slope down either towards the east or towards the west, for then the\r\nshadows on either side of the north-and-south line would be unequal. And\r\nthough a slope towards north or south would not affect the equality of\r\nsuch shadows, and would therefore be admissible, yet it would clearly be\r\naltogether undesirable; since the avoidance of a slope towards east or\r\nwest would be made much more difficult if the surface were tilted,\r\nhowever slightly, towards north or south. Apart from this, several other\r\ncircumstances make it extremely desirable that the surface from which\r\nthe astronomers make their observations should be perfectly horizontal.\r\nIn particular, we shall see presently that the exact determination of\r\nelevations above the eastern and western horizons would be very\r\nnecessary even in the earliest and simplest methods of observation, and\r\nfor this purpose it would be essential that the observing surface should\r\nbe as carefully levelled in a north-and-south as in an east-and-west\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nWe should expect to find, then, that when the particular stage of\r\nastronomical progress had been reached, at which men not only perceived\r\nthe necessity of well-devised buildings for astronomical observation,\r\nbut were able to devote time, labour, and expense to the construction of\r\nsuch buildings, the first point to which they would direct their\r\nattention would be the formation of a perfectly level surface, on which\r\neventually they might lay down a north-and-south or true meridional\r\nline.\r\n\r\nNow, of the extreme care with which this preliminary question of level\r\nwas considered by the builders of the great pyramid, we have singularly\r\nclear and decisive evidence. For all around the base of the pyramid\r\nthere was a pavement, and we find the builders not only so well\r\nacquainted with the position of the true horizontal plane at the level\r\nof this pavement, but so careful to follow it (even as respects this\r\npavement, which, be it noticed, was only, in all probability, a\r\nsubsidiary and quasi-ornamental feature of the building), that the\r\npavement \"was varied in thickness at the rate of about an inch in 100\r\nfeet to make it absolutely level, which the rock was not.\"[43]\r\n\r\nBut now with regard to the true north-and-south direction, although the\r\nshadow method, carried out on a truly level surface, would be\r\nsatisfactory enough for a first rough approximation, or even for what\r\nany but astronomers would regard as extreme accuracy, it would be open\r\nto serious objections for really exact work. These objections would\r\nhave become known to observers long before the construction of the\r\npyramid was commenced, and would have been associated with the\r\ndifficulties which suggested, I think, the idea itself of constructing\r\nsuch an edifice.\r\n\r\nSupposing an upright pointed post is set up, and the position of the end\r\nof the shadow upon a perfectly level surface is noted; then whatever use\r\nwe intend to make of this observation, it is essential that we should\r\nknow the precise position of the centre of the upright's base, and also\r\nthat the upright should be truly vertical. Otherwise we have only\r\nexactly obtained the position of one end of the line we want, and to\r\ndraw the line properly we ought as exactly to know the position of the\r\nother end. If we want _also_ to know the true position of a line joining\r\nthe point of the upright and the shadow of this point, we require to\r\nknow the true height of the upright. And even if we have these points\r\ndetermined, we still have not a _material_ line from the point of the\r\nupright to the place of its shadow. A cord or chain from one point to\r\nthe other would be curved, even if tightly stretched, and it would not\r\nbe tightly stretched, if long, without either breaking or pulling over\r\nthe upright. A straight bar of the required length could not be readily\r\nmade or used: if stout enough to lie straight from point to point it\r\nwould be unwieldy, if not stout enough so that it bent under its own\r\nweight it would be useless.\r\n\r\nThus the shadow method, while difficult of application to give a true\r\nnorth-and-south horizontal line, would fail utterly to give material\r\nindications of the sun's elevation on particular days, without which it\r\nwould be impossible to obtain in this manner any material indications of\r\nthe position of the celestial pole.\r\n\r\nA natural resource, under these circumstances--at least a natural\r\nresource for astronomers who could afford to adopt the plan--would be to\r\nbuild up masses of masonry, in which there should be tubular holes or\r\ntunnellings pointing in certain required directions. In one sense the\r\ncontrivance would be clumsy, for a tunnelling once constructed, would\r\nnot admit of any change of position, nor even allow of any save very\r\nlimited changes in the direction of the line of view through them. In\r\nfact, the more effective a tunnelling would be in determining any\r\nparticular direction, the less scope, of course, would it afford for any\r\nchange in the direction of a line of sight along it. So that the\r\nastronomical architect would have to limit the use of this particular\r\nmethod to those cases in which great accuracy in obtaining a direction\r\nline and great rigidity in the material indication of that line's\r\nposition were essential or at least exceedingly desirable. Again, in\r\nsome cases presently to be noticed, he would require, not a tubing\r\ndirected to some special fixed point in the sky, but an opening\r\ncommanding some special range of view. Yet again it would be manifestly\r\nwell for him to retain, whenever possible, the power of using the shadow\r\nmethod in observing the sun and moon; for this method in the case of\r\nbodies varying their position on the celestial sphere, not merely with\r\nrespect to the cardinal points, would be of great value. Its value would\r\nbe enhanced if the shadows could be formed by objects and received on\r\nsurfaces holding a permanent position.\r\n\r\nWe begin to see some of the requirements of an astronomical building\r\nsuch as we have supposed the earlier observers to plan.\r\n\r\nFirst, such a building must be large, to give suitable length to the\r\ndirection lines, whether along edges of the building or along tubular\r\npassages or tunnellings within it. Secondly, it must be massive in order\r\nthat these edges and passages might have the necessary stability and\r\npermanence. Thirdly, it must be of a form contributing to such\r\nstability, and as height above surrounding objects (even hills lying at\r\nconsiderable distances) would be a desirable feature, it would be proper\r\nto have the mass of masonry growing smaller from the base upwards.\r\nFourthly, it must have its sides carefully oriented, so that it must\r\nhave either a square or oblong base with two sides lying exactly north\r\nand south, and the other two lying exactly east and west. Fifthly, it\r\nmust have the direction of the pole of the heavens either actually\r\nindicated by a tunnelling of some sort pointed directly polewards, or\r\nelse inferable from a tunnelling pointing upon a suitable star close to\r\nthe true pole of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe lower part of a pyramid would fulfil the conditions required for the\r\nstability of such a structure, and a square or oblong form would be\r\nsuitable for the base of such a pyramid. We must not overlook the fact\r\nthat a complete pyramid would be utterly unsuitable for an astronomical\r\nedifice. Even a pyramid built up of layers of stone and continued so far\r\nupwards that the uppermost layer consisted of a single massive stone,\r\nwould be quite useless as an observatory. The notion which has been\r\nentertained by some fanciful persons, that one purpose which the great\r\npyramid was intended to subserve, was to provide a raised small platform\r\nhigh above the general level of the soil, in order that astronomers\r\nmight climb night after night to that platform, and thence make their\r\nobservations on the stars, is altogether untenable. Probably no fancy\r\nrespecting the pyramids has done more to discredit the astronomical\r\ntheory of these structures than has this ridiculous notion; because even\r\nthose who are not astronomers and therefore little familiar with the\r\nrequirements of a building intended for astronomical observation,\r\nperceive at once the futility of any such arrangement, and the enormous,\r\none may almost say the infinite disproportion between the cost at which\r\nthe raised small platform would have been obtained, and the small\r\nadvantage which astronomers would derive from climbing up to it instead\r\nof observing from the ground level. Yet we have seen this notion not\r\nonly gravely advanced by persons who are to some degree acquainted with\r\nastronomical requirements, but elaborately illustrated. Thus, in\r\nFlammariou's \"History of the Heavens,\" there is a picture representing\r\nsix astronomers in eastern garb, perched in uncomfortable attitudes on\r\nthe uppermost steps of a pyramid, whence they are staring hard at a\r\ncomet, naturally without the slightest opportunity of determining its\r\ntrue position in the sky, since they have no direction lines of any sort\r\nfor their guidance. Apart from this, their attention is very properly\r\ndirected in great part to the necessity of preserving their equilibrium.\r\nIn only one point in fact does this picture accord with à priori\r\nprobabilities--namely, in the great muscular development of these\r\nancient observers. They are perfectly herculean, and well they might be,\r\nif night after night they had to observe the celestial bodies from a\r\nplace so hard to reach, and where attitudes so awkward must be\r\nmaintained during the long hours of the night.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly clear, and is in fact one of the chief difficulties of\r\nthe astronomical theory of the pyramids, that it would only be when\r\nthese buildings were as yet incomplete that they could subserve any\r\nuseful astronomical purposes; nevertheless we must not on this account\r\nsuffer ourselves at this early stage of our inquiry to be diverted from\r\nthe astronomical theory by what must be admitted to be a very strong\r\nargument against it. We have seen that there is such decisive and even\r\ndemonstrative evidence in favour of the theory that the pyramids were\r\nnot oriented in a general, still less in a merely casual, manner, and\r\nthis is, in reality, such clear evidence of their astronomical\r\nsignificance, that we must pass further on upon the line of reasoning\r\nwhich we have adopted--prepared to turn back indeed if absolutely\r\nconvincing evidence should be found against the theory of the\r\nastronomical _purpose_ of the pyramids, but anticipating rather that, on\r\na close inquiry, a means of obviating this particular objection may\r\nbefore long be found.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, then, that astronomers have determined to erect a\r\nmassive edifice, on a square or oblong base properly oriented,\r\nconstructing within this edifice such tubular openings as would be most\r\nuseful for the purpose of indicating the true directions of certain\r\ncelestial objects at particular times and seasons.\r\n\r\nBefore commencing so costly a structure they would be careful to select\r\nthe best possible position for it, not only as respects the nature of\r\nthe ground, but also as respects latitude. For it must be remembered\r\nthat, from certain parts of the earth, the various points and circles\r\nwhich the astronomer recognizes in the heavens occupy special positions\r\nand fulfil special relations.\r\n\r\nSo far as conditions of the soil, surrounding country, and so forth are\r\nconcerned, few positions could surpass that selected for the great\r\npyramid and its companions. The pyramids of Ghizeh are situated on a\r\nplatform of rock, about 150 feet above the level of the desert. The\r\nlargest of them, the Pyramid of Cheops, stands on an elevation free all\r\naround, insomuch that less sand has gathered round it than would\r\notherwise have been the case. How admirably suited these pyramids are\r\nfor observing stations is shown by the way in which they are themselves\r\nseen from a distance. It has been remarked by every one who has seen\r\nthe pyramids that the sense of sight is deceived in the attempt to\r\nappreciate their distance and magnitude. \"Though removed several leagues\r\nfrom the spectator, they appear to be close at hand; and it is not until\r\nhe has travelled some miles in a direct line towards them, that he\r\nbecomes sensible of their vast bulk and also of the pure atmosphere\r\nthrough which they are viewed.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to their astronomical position, it seems clear that the\r\nbuilders intended to place the great pyramid precisely in latitude 30°,\r\nor, in other words, in that latitude where the true pole of the heavens\r\nis one-third of the way from the horizon to the point overhead (the\r\nzenith), and where the noon sun at true spring or autumn (when the sun\r\nrises almost exactly in the east, and sets almost exactly in the west)\r\nis two-thirds of the way from the horizon to the point overhead. In an\r\nobservatory set exactly in this position, some of the calculations or\r\ngeometrical constructions, as the case may be, involved in astronomical\r\nproblems, are considerably simplified. The first problem in Euclid, for\r\nexample, by which a triangle of three equal sides is made, affords the\r\nmeans of drawing the proper angle at which the mid-day sun in spring or\r\nautumn is raised above the horizon, and at which the pole of the heavens\r\nis removed from the point overhead. Relations depending on this angle\r\nare also more readily calculated, for the very same reason, in fact,\r\nthat the angle itself is more readily drawn. And though the builders of\r\nthe great pyramid must have been advanced far beyond the stage at which\r\nany difficulty in dealing directly with other angles would be involved,\r\nyet they would perceive the great advantage of having one among the\r\nangles entering into their problems thus conveniently chosen. In our\r\ntime, when by the use of logarithmic and other tables, all calculations\r\nare greatly simplified, and when also astronomers have learned to\r\nrecognize that no possible choice of latitude would simplify their\r\nlabours (unless an observatory could be set up at the North Pole itself,\r\nwhich would be in other respects inconvenient), matters of this sort are\r\nno longer worth considering, but to the mathematicians who planned the\r\ngreat pyramid they would have possessed extreme importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nTo set the centre of the pyramid's future base in latitude 30°, two\r\nmethods could be used, both already to some degree considered--the\r\nshadow method, and the Pole-star method. If at noon, at the season when\r\nthe sun rose due east and set due west, an upright A C were found to\r\nthrow a shadow C D, so proportioned to A C that A C D would be one-half\r\nof an equal-sided triangle, then, theoretically, the point where this\r\nupright was placed would be in latitude 30°. As a matter of fact it\r\nwould not be, because the air, by bending the sun's rays, throws the sun\r\napparently somewhat above his true position. Apart from this, at the\r\ntime of true spring or autumn, the sun does not seem to rise due east,\r\nor set due west, for he is raised above the horizon by atmospheric\r\nrefraction, before he has really reached it in the morning, and he\r\nremains raised above it after he has really passed below--understanding\r\nthe word \"really\" to relate to his actual geometrical direction. Thus,\r\nat true spring and autumn, the sun rises slightly to the north of east,\r\nand sets slightly to the north of west. The atmospheric refraction is\r\nindeed so marked, as respects these parts of the sun's apparent course,\r\nthat it must have been quickly recognized. Probably, however, it would\r\nbe regarded as a peculiarity only affecting the sun when close to the\r\nhorizon, and would be (correctly) associated with his apparent change of\r\nshape when so situated. Astronomers would be prevented in this way from\r\nusing the sun's horizontal position at any season to guide them with\r\nrespect to the cardinal points, but they would still consider the sun,\r\nwhen raised high above the horizon, as a suitable astronomical index (so\r\nto speak), and would have no idea that even at a height of sixty degrees\r\nabove the horizon, or seen as in direction D A, Fig. 1, he is seen\r\nappreciably above his true position.\r\n\r\nAdopting this method--the shadow method--to fix the latitude of the\r\npyramid's base, they would conceive the sun was sixty degrees above the\r\nhorizon at noon, at true spring or autumn, when in reality he was\r\nsomewhat below that elevation. Or, in other words, they would conceive\r\nthey were in latitude 30° north, when in reality they were farther north\r\n(the mid-day sun at any season sinking lower and lower as we travel\r\nfarther and farther north). The actual amount by which, supposing their\r\nobservations exact, they would thus set this station north of its proper\r\nposition, would depend on the refractive qualities of the air in Egypt.\r\nBut although there is some slight difference in this respect between\r\nEgypt and Greenwich, it is but small; and we can determine from the\r\nGreenwich refraction tables, within a very slight limit of error, the\r\namount by which the architects of the great pyramid would have set the\r\ncentre or the base north of latitude 30°, if they had trusted solely to\r\nthe shadow method. The distance would have been as nearly as possible\r\n1125 yards, or say three furlongs.\r\n\r\nNow, if they followed the other method, observing the stars around the\r\npole, in order to determine the elevation of the true pole of the\r\nheavens, they would be in a similar way exposed to error arising from\r\nthe effects of atmospheric refraction. They would proceed probably\r\nsomewhat in this wise:--Using any kind of direction lines, they would\r\ntake the altitude of their Polar star (1) when passing immediately under\r\nthe pole, and (2) when passing immediately above the pole. The mean of\r\nthe altitudes thus obtained would be the altitude of the true pole of\r\nthe heavens. Now, atmospheric refraction affects the stars in the same\r\nway that it affects the sun, and the nearer a star is to the horizon,\r\nthe more it is raised by atmospheric refraction. The Pole-star in both\r\nits positions--that is when passing below the pole, and when passing\r\nabove that point--is raised by refraction, rather more when below than\r\nwhen above; but the estimated position of the pole itself, raised by\r\nabout the mean of these two effects, is in effect raised almost exactly\r\nas much as it would be if it were itself directly observed (that is, if\r\na star occupied the pole itself, instead of merely circling close round\r\nthe pole). We may then simplify matters by leaving out of consideration\r\nat present all questions of the actual Pole-star in the time of the\r\npyramid builders, and simply considering how far they would have set the\r\npyramid's base in error, if they had determined their latitude by\r\nobserving a star occupying the position of the true pole of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThey would have endeavoured to determine where the pole appears to be\r\nraised exactly thirty degrees above the horizon. But the effect of\r\nrefraction being to raise every celestial object above its true\r\nposition, they would have supposed the pole to be raised thirty degrees,\r\nwhen in reality it was less raised than this. In other words, they would\r\nhave supposed they were in latitude 30°, when, in reality, they were in\r\nsome lower latitude, for the pole of the heavens rises higher and higher\r\nabove the horizon as we pass to higher and higher latitudes. Thus they\r\nwould set their station somewhat to the south of latitude 30°, instead\r\nof to the north, as when they were supposed to have used the shadow\r\nmethod. Here again we can find how far they would set it south of that\r\nlatitude. Using the Greenwich refraction table (which is the same as\r\nBessel's), we find that they would have made a much greater error than\r\nwhen using the other method, simply because they would be observing a\r\nbody at an elevation of about thirty degrees only, whereas in taking the\r\nsun's mid-day altitude in spring or autumn, they would be observing a\r\nbody at twice as great an elevation. The error would be, in fact, in\r\nthis case, about 1 mile 1512 yards.\r\n\r\nIt seems not at all unlikely that astronomers, so skilful and ingenious\r\nas the builders of the pyramid manifestly were, would have employed both\r\nmethods. In that case they would certainly have obtained widely\r\ndiscrepant results, rough as their means and methods must unquestionably\r\nhave been, compared with modern instruments and methods. The exact\r\ndetermination from the shadow plan would have set them 1125 yards to the\r\nnorth of the true latitude; while the exact determination from the\r\nPole-star method would have set them 1 mile 1512 yards south of the true\r\nlatitude. Whether they would thus have been led to detect the effect of\r\natmospheric refraction on celestial bodies high above the horizon may be\r\nopen to question. But certainly they would have recognized the action of\r\nsome cause or other, rendering one or other method, or both methods,\r\nunsatisfactory If so, and we can scarcely doubt that this would actually\r\nhappen (for certainly they would recognize the theoretical justice of\r\nboth methods, and we can hardly imagine that having two available\r\nmethods, they would limit their operations to one method only), they\r\nwould scarcely see any better way of proceeding than to take a position\r\nintermediate between the two which they had thus obtained. Such a\r\nposition would lie almost exactly 1072 yards south of true latitude 30°\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nWhether the architects of the pyramid of Cheops really proceeded in this\r\nway or not, it is certain that they obtained a result corresponding so\r\nwell with this that if we assume they really did intend to set the base\r\nof the pyramid in latitude 30°, we find it difficult to persuade\r\nourselves that they did not follow some such course as I have just\r\nindicated--the coincidence is so close considering the nature of the\r\nobservations involved. According to Professor Piazzi Smyth, whose\r\nobservational labours in relation to the great pyramid are worthy of all\r\npraise, the centre of the base of this pyramid lies about 1 mile 568\r\nyards south of the thirtieth parallel of latitude. This is 944 yards\r\nnorth of the position they would have deduced from the Pole-star method;\r\n1 mile 1693 yards south of the position they would have deduced from the\r\nshadow method; and 1256 yards south of the mean position between the two\r\nlast-named. The position of the base seems to prove beyond all\r\npossibility of question that the shadow method was not the method on\r\nwhich sole or chief reliance was placed, though this method must have\r\nbeen known to the builders of the pyramid. It does not, however, prove\r\nthat the star method was the only method followed. A distance of 944\r\nyards is so small in a matter of this sort that we might fairly enough\r\nassume that the position of the base was determined by the Pole-star\r\nmethod. If, however, we supposed the builders of the pyramid to have\r\nbeen exceedingly skilful in applying the methods available to them, we\r\nmight not unreasonably conclude from the position of the pyramid's base\r\nthat they used both the shadow method and the Pole-star method, but\r\nthat, recognizing the superiority of the latter, they gave greater\r\nweight to the result of employing this method. Supposing, for instance,\r\nthey applied the Pole-star method three times as often as the shadow\r\nmethod, and took the mean of all the results thus obtained, then the\r\ndeduced position would lie three times as far from the northern position\r\nobtained by the shadow method as from the southern position obtained by\r\nthe Pole-star method. In this case their result, if correctly deduced,\r\nwould have been only about 156 yards north of the actual present\r\nposition of the centre of the base.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, however, to place the least reliance on any\r\ncalculation like that made in the last few lines. By _à posteriori_\r\nreasoning such as this one can prove almost anything about the pyramids.\r\nFor observe, though presented as _à priori_ reasoning, it is in reality\r\nnot so, being based on the observed fact, that the true position lies\r\nmore than three times as far from the northerly limit as from the\r\nsouthern one. Now, if in any other way, not open to exception, we knew\r\nthat the builders of the pyramid used both the sun method and the star\r\nmethod, with perfect observational accuracy, but without knowledge of\r\nthe laws of atmospheric refraction, we could infer from the observed\r\nposition the precise relative weights they attached to the two methods.\r\nBut it is altogether unsafe, or, to speak plainly, it is in the logical\r\nsense a perfectly vicious manner of reasoning, to ascertain first such\r\nrelative weights on an assumption of this kind, and having so found\r\nthem, to assert that the relation thus detected is a probable one in\r\nitself, and that since, when assumed, it accounts precisely for the\r\nobserved position of the pyramid, therefore the pyramid was posited in\r\nthat way and no other. It has been by unsound reasoning of this kind\r\nthat nine-tenths of the absurdities have been established on which\r\nTaylor and Professor Smyth and their followers have established what may\r\nbe called the pyramid religion.\r\n\r\nAll we can fairly assume as probable from the evidence, in so far as\r\nthat evidence bears on the results of _à priori_ considerations, is that\r\nthe builders of the great pyramid preferred the Pole-star method to the\r\nshadow method, as a means of determining the true position of latitude\r\n30° north. They seem to have applied this method with great skill\r\nconsidering the means at their disposal, if we suppose that they took no\r\naccount whatever of the influence of refraction. If they took refraction\r\ninto account at all they considerably underrated its influence.\r\n\r\nPiazzi Smyth's idea that they knew the _precise_ position of the\r\nthirtieth parallel of latitude, and also the _precise_ position of the\r\nparallel, where, owing to refraction, the Pole-star would appear to be\r\nthirty degrees above the horizon, and deliberately set the base of the\r\npyramid between these limits (not exactly or nearly exactly half-way,\r\nbut somewhere between them), cannot be entertained for a moment by any\r\none not prepared to regard the whole history of the construction of the\r\npyramid as supernatural. My argument, let me note in passing, is not\r\nintended for persons who take this particular view of the pyramid, a\r\nview on which reasoning could not very well be brought to bear.\r\n\r\nIf the star method had been used to determine the position of the\r\nparallel of 30° north latitude, we may be certain it would be used also\r\nto orient the building. Probably indeed the very structures (temporary,\r\nof course) by which the final observations for the latitude had been\r\nmade, would remain available also for the orientation. These structures\r\nwould consist of uprights so placed that the line of sight along their\r\nextremities (or along a tube perhaps borne aloft by them in a slanting\r\nposition) the Pole-star could be seen when immediately below or\r\nimmediately above the pole. Altogether the more convenient direction of\r\nthe two would be that towards the Pole-star when below the pole. The\r\nextremities of these uprights, or the axis of the upraised tube, would\r\nlie in a north-and-south line considerably inclined to the horizon,\r\nbecause the pole itself being thirty degrees above the horizon, the\r\nPole-star, whatever star this might be, would be high above the horizon\r\neven when exactly under the pole. No star so far from the pole as to\r\npass close to the horizon would be of use even for the work of\r\norientation, while for the work of obtaining the latitude it would be\r\nabsolutely essential that a star close to the pole should be used.\r\n\r\nA line along the feet of the uprights would run north-and-south. But the\r\nvery object for which the great astronomical edifice was being raised,\r\nwas that the north-and-south line amongst others should be indicated by\r\nmore perfect methods.\r\n\r\nNow at this stage of proceedings, what could be more perfect as a method\r\nof obtaining the true bearing of the pole than to dig a tubular hole\r\ninto the solid rock, along which tube the Pole-star at its lower\r\nculmination should be visible? Perfect stability would be thus insured\r\nfor this fundamental direction line. It would be easy to obtain the\r\ndirection with great accuracy, even though at first starting the borings\r\nwere not quite correctly made. And the further the boring was continued\r\ndownwards towards the south the greater the accuracy of the direction\r\nline thus obtained. Of course there could be no question whatever in\r\nsuch underground boring, of the advantage of taking the lower passage of\r\nthe Pole-star, not the upper. For a line directly from the star at its\r\nupper passage would slant downwards at an angle of more than thirty\r\ndegrees from the horizon, while a line directly from the star at its\r\nlower passage would slant downwards at an angle of less than thirty\r\ndegrees; and the smaller this angle the less would be the length, and\r\nthe less the depth of the boring required for any given horizontal\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nBesides perfect stability, a boring through the solid rock would present\r\nanother most important advantage over any other method of orienting the\r\nbase of the pyramid. In the case of an inclined direction line above the\r\nlevel of the horizontal base, there would be the difficulty of\r\ndetermining the precise position of points under the raised line; for\r\nmanifest difficulties would arise in letting fall plumb-lines from\r\nvarious points along the optical axis of a raised tubing. But nothing\r\ncould be simpler than the plan by which the horizontal line\r\ncorresponding to the underground tube could be determined. All that\r\nwould be necessary would be to allow the tube to terminate in a\r\ntolerably large open space; and from a point in the base vertically\r\nabove this, to let fall a plumb-line through a fine vertical boring into\r\nthis open space. It would thus be found how far the point from which the\r\nplumb-line was let fall lay, either to the east or to the west of the\r\noptical axis of the underground tunnel, and therefore how far to the\r\neast or to the west of the centre of the open mouth of this tunnel. Thus\r\nthe true direction of a north-and-south line from the end of the tube to\r\nthe middle of the base would be ascertained. This would be the meridian\r\nline of the pyramid's base, or rather the meridian line corresponding to\r\nthe position of the underground passage directed towards the Pole-star\r\nwhen immediately under the pole.\r\n\r\nA line at right angles to the meridian line thus obtained would lie due\r\neast and west, and the true position of the east-and-west line would\r\nprobably be better indicated in this way than by direct observation of\r\nthe sun or stars. If direct observation were made at all, it would be\r\nmade not on the sun in the horizon near the time of spring and autumn,\r\nfor the sun's position is then largely affected by refraction. The sun\r\nmight be observed for this purpose during the summer months, at moments\r\nwhen calculation showed that he should be due east or west, or crossing\r\nwhat is technically the _prime vertical_. Possibly the so-called azimuth\r\ntrenches on the east side of the great pyramid may have been in some way\r\nassociated with observations of this sort, as the middle trench is\r\ndirected considerably to the north of the east point, and not far from\r\nthe direction in which the sun would rise when about thirty degrees (a\r\nfavourite angle with the pyramid architects) past the vernal equinox.\r\nBut I lay no stress on this point. The meridian line obtained from the\r\nunderground passage would have given the builders so ready a means of\r\ndetermining accurately the east and west lines for the north and south\r\nedges of the pyramid's base, that any other observations for this\r\npurpose can hardly have been more than subsidiary.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, well known that there is precisely such an underground\r\ntunnelling as the considerations I have indicated seem to suggest as a\r\ndesirable feature in a proposed astronomical edifice on a very noble\r\nscale. In all the pyramids of Ghizeh, indeed, there is such a tunnelling\r\nas we might expect on almost any theory of the relation of the smaller\r\npyramids to the great one. But the slant tunnel under the great pyramid\r\nis constructed with far greater skill and care than have been bestowed\r\non the tunnels under the other pyramids. Its length underground amounts\r\nto more than 350 feet, so that, viewed from the bottom, the mouth, about\r\nfour feet across from top to bottom on the square, would give a sky\r\nrange of rather less than one-third of a degree, or about one-fourth\r\nmore than the moon's apparent diameter. But, of course, there was\r\nnothing to prevent the observers who used this tube from greatly\r\nnarrowing these limits by using diaphragms, one covering up all the\r\nmouth of the tube, except a small opening near the centre, and another\r\ncorrespondingly occupying the lower part of the tube from which the\r\nobservation was made.\r\n\r\nIt seems satisfactorily made out that the object of the slant tunnel,\r\nwhich runs 350 feet through the rock on which the pyramid is built, was\r\nto observe the Pole-star of the period at its lower culmination, to\r\nobtain thence the true direction of the north point. The slow motion of\r\na star very near the pole would cause any error in time, as when this\r\nobservation was made, to be of very little importance, though we can\r\nunderstand that even such observations as these would remind the\r\nbuilders of the pyramid of the absolute necessity of good\r\ntime-measurements and time-observations in astronomical research.\r\n\r\nFinding this point clearly made out, we can fairly use the observed\r\ndirection of the inclined passage to determine what was the position of\r\nthe Pole-star at the time when the foundations of the great pyramid were\r\nlaid, and even what that Pole-star may have been. On this point there\r\nhas never been much doubt, though considerable doubt exists as to the\r\nexact epoch when the star occupied the position in question. According\r\nto the observations made by Professor Smyth, the entrance passage has a\r\nslope of about 26° 27', which would have corresponded, when refraction\r\nis taken into account, to the elevation of the star observed through the\r\npassage, at an angle of about 26° 29' above the horizon. The true\r\nlatitude of the pyramid being 29° 58' 51\", corresponding to an elevation\r\nof the true pole of the heavens, by about 30° 1/2' above the horizon, it\r\nfollows that if Professor Smyth obtained the true angle for the entrance\r\npassage, the Pole-star must have been about 3° 31-1/2' from the pole.\r\nSmyth himself considers that we ought to infer the angle for the\r\nentrance passage from that of other internal passages, presently to be\r\nmentioned, which he thinks were manifestly intended to be at the same\r\nangle of inclination, though directed southwards instead of northwards.\r\nAssuming this to be the case, though for my own part I cannot see why we\r\nshould do so (most certainly we have no _à priori_ reason for so doing),\r\nwe should have 26° 18' as about the required angle of inclination,\r\nwhence we should get about 3° 42' for the distance of the Pole-star of\r\nthe pyramid's time from the true pole of the heavens. The difference may\r\nseem of very slight importance, and I note that Professor Smyth passes\r\nit over as if it really were unimportant; but in reality it corresponds\r\nto somewhat large time-differences. He quotes Sir J. Herschel's correct\r\nstatement, that about the year 2170 B.C. the star Alpha Draconis, when\r\npassing below the pole, was elevated at an angle of about 26° 18' above\r\nthe horizon, or was about 3° 42' from the pole of the heavens (I have\r\nbefore me, as I write, Sir J. Herschel's original statement, which is\r\nnot put precisely in this way); and he mentions also that somewhere\r\nabout 3440 B.C. the same star was situated at about the same distance\r\nfrom the pole. But he omits to notice that since, during the long\r\ninterval of 1270 years, Alpha Draconis had been first gradually\r\napproaching the pole until it was at its nearest, when it was only about\r\n3-1/2' from that point, and then as gradually receding from the pole\r\nuntil again 3° 42' from it, it follows that the difference of nine or\r\nten minutes in the estimated inclination of the entrance passage\r\ncorresponds to a very considerable interval in time, certainly to not\r\nless than fifty years. (Exact calculation would be easy, but it would be\r\ntime wasted where the data are inexact.)\r\n\r\nHaving their base properly oriented, and being about to erect the\r\nbuilding itself, the architects would certainly not have closed the\r\nmouth of the slant tunnel pointing northwards, but would have carried\r\nthe passage onwards through the basement layers of the edifice, until\r\nthese had reached the height corresponding to the place where the\r\nprolongation of the passage would meet the slanting north face of the\r\nbuilding. I incline to think that at this place they would not be\r\ncontent to allow the north face to remain in steps, but would fit in\r\ncasing stones (not necessarily those which would eventually form the\r\nslant surface of the pyramid, but more probably slanted so as to be\r\nperpendicular to the axis of the ascending passage.) They would probably\r\ncut a square aperture through such slant stones corresponding to the\r\nsize of the passage elsewhere, so as to make the four surfaces of the\r\npassage perfectly plane from its greatest depth below the base of the\r\npyramid to its aperture, close to the surface to be formed eventually by\r\nthe casing stones of the pyramid itself.\r\n\r\nNow, in this part of his work, the astronomical architect could scarcely\r\nfail to take into account the circumstance that the inclined passage,\r\nhowever convenient as bearing upon a bright star near the pole when that\r\nstar was due north, was, nevertheless, not coincident in direction with\r\nthe true polar axis of the celestial sphere. I cannot but think he would\r\nin some way mark the position of their true polar axis. And the natural\r\nway of marking it would be to indicate where the passage of his\r\nPole-star _above_ the pole ceased to be visible through the slant tube.\r\nIn other words he would mark where a line from the middle of the lowest\r\nface of the inclined passage to the middle of the upper edge of the\r\nmouth was inclined by twice the angle 3° 42' to the axis of the passage.\r\nTo an eye placed on the optical axis of the passage, at this distance\r\nfrom the mouth the middle of the upper edge of the mouth would (_quam\r\nproximé_) show the place of the true pole of the heavens. It certainly\r\nis a singular coincidence that at the part of the tube where this\r\ncondition would be fulfilled, there is a peculiarity in the construction\r\nof the entrance passage, which has been indeed otherwise explained, but\r\nI shall leave the reader to determine whether the other explanation is\r\naltogether a likely one. The feature is described by Smyth as \"a most\r\nsingular portion of the passage--viz., a place where two adjacent\r\nwall-joints, similar, too, on either side of the passage, were vertical\r\nor nearly so; while every other wall-joint, both above and below, was\r\n_rectangular_ to the length of the passage, and, therefore, largely\r\n_inclined_ to the vertical.\" Now I take the mean of Smyth's\r\ndeterminations of the transverse height of the entrance passage as 47.23\r\ninches (the extreme values are 47.14 and 47.32), and I find that, from a\r\npoint on the floor of the entrance passage, this transverse height would\r\nsubtend an angle of 7° 24' (the range of Alpha Draconis in altitude when\r\non the meridian) at a distance 363.65 inches from the transverse mouth\r\nof the passage. Taking this distance from Smyth's scale in Plate xvii.\r\nof his work on the pyramid (\"Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid\"), I\r\nfind that, if measured along the base of the entrance passage from the\r\nlowest edge of the vertical stone, it falls exactly upon the spot where\r\nhe has marked in the probable outline of the uncased pyramid, while, if\r\nmeasured from the upper edge of the same stone, it falls just about as\r\nfar within the outline of the cased pyramid as we should expect the\r\nouter edge of a sloped end stone to the tunnel to have lain.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that from the floor of the entrance passage no star could\r\nhave been seen, because no eye could be placed there. But the builders\r\nof the pyramid cannot reasonably be supposed to have been ignorant of\r\nthe simple properties of plane mirrors, and by simply placing a thin\r\npiece of polished metal upon the floor at this spot, and noting where\r\nthey could see the star and the upper edge of the tunnel's mouth in\r\ncontact by reflection in this mirror, they could determine precisely\r\nwhere the star could be seen touching that edge, by an eye placed (were\r\nthat possible) precisely in the plane of the floor.\r\n\r\nI have said there is another explanation of this peculiarity in the\r\nentrance passage, but I should rather have said there is another\r\nexplanation of a line marked on the stone next below the vertical one. I\r\nshould imagine this line, which is nothing more than a mark such \"as\r\nmight be ruled with a blunt steel instrument, but by a master hand for\r\npower, evenness, straightness, and still more for rectangularity to the\r\npassage axis,\" was a mere sign to show where the upright stone was to\r\ncome. But Professor Smyth, who gives no explanation of the upright stone\r\nitself, except that it seems, from its upright position, to have had\r\n\"something representative of setting up, or preparation for the erecting\r\nof a building,\" believes that the mark is as many inches from the mouth\r\nof the tunnel as there were years between the dispersal of man and the\r\nbuilding of the pyramid; that thence downwards to the place where an\r\nascending passage begins, marks in like manner the number of years which\r\nwere to follow before the Exodus; thence along the ascending passage to\r\nthe beginning of the great gallery the number of years from the Exodus\r\nto the coming of Christ; and thence along the floor of the grand gallery\r\nto its end, the interval between the first coming of Christ and the\r\nsecond coming or the end of the world, which it appears is to take place\r\nin the year 1881. It is true not one of these intervals accords with the\r\ndates given by those who are considered the best authorities in Biblical\r\nmatters,--but so much the worse for the dates.\r\n\r\nTo return to the pyramid.\r\n\r\nWe have considered how, probably, the architect would plan the\r\nprolongation of the entrance passage to its place of opening out on the\r\nnorthern face. But as the pyramid rose layer by layer above its\r\nbasement, there must be ascending passages of some sort towards the\r\nsouth, the most important part of the sky in astronomical research.\r\n\r\nThe astronomers who planned the pyramid would specially require four\r\nthings. First, they must have the ascending passage in the absolutely\r\ntrue meridian plan; secondly, they would require to have in view, along\r\na passage as narrow as the entrance tunnel, some conspicuous star, if\r\npossible a star so bright as to be visible by day (along such a tunnel)\r\nas well as by night; thirdly, they must have the means of observing the\r\nsun at solar noon on every day in the year; and fourthly, they must also\r\nhave the entire range of the zodiac or planetary highway brought into\r\nview along their chief meridional opening.\r\n\r\nThe first of these points is at once the most important and the most\r\ndifficult. It is so important, indeed, that we may hope for significant\r\nevidence from the consideration of the methods which would suggest\r\nthemselves as available.\r\n\r\nConsider:--The square base has been duly oriented. Therefore, if each\r\nsquare layer is placed properly, the continually diminishing square\r\nplatform will remain always oriented. But if any error is made in this\r\nwork the exactness of the orientation will gradually be lost. And this\r\npart of the work cannot be tested by astronomical observations as exact\r\nas those by which the base was laid, unless the vertical boring by which\r\nthe middle of the base, or a point near it, was brought into connection\r\nwith the entrance passage, is continued upwards through the successive\r\nlayers of the pyramidal structure. As the rock rises to a considerable\r\nheight within the interior of the pyramid,[44] probably to quite the\r\nheight of the opening of the entrance passage on the northern slope, it\r\nwould only be found necessary to carry up this vertical boring on the\r\nbuilding itself after this level had been reached. But in any case this\r\nwould be but an unsatisfactory way of obtaining the meridian plane when\r\nonce the boring had reached a higher level than the opening of the\r\nentrance passage; for only horizontal lines from the boring to the\r\ninclined tunnelling would be of use for exact work, and no such lines\r\ncould be drawn when once the level of the upper end of the entrance\r\npassage had been passed by the builders.\r\n\r\nA plan would be available, however (not yet noticed, so far as I know,\r\nby any who have studied the astronomical relations of the great\r\npyramid), which would have enabled the builders perfectly to overcome\r\nthis difficulty.\r\n\r\nSuppose the line of sight down the entrance passage were continued\r\nupwards along an ascending passage, after reflection at a perfectly\r\nhorizontal surface--the surface of still water--then by the simplest of\r\nall optical laws, that of the reflection of light, the descending and\r\nascending lines of sight on either side of the place of reflection,\r\nwould lie in the same vertical plane, that, namely, of the entrance\r\npassage, or of the meridian. Moreover, the farther upwards an ascending\r\npassage was carried, along which the reflected visual rays could pass,\r\nthe more perfect would be the adjustment of this meridional plane.\r\n\r\nTo apply this method, it would be necessary to temporarily plug up the\r\nentrance passage where it passed into the solid rock, to make the\r\nstone-work above it very perfect and close fitting, so that whenever\r\noccasion arose for making one of the observations we are considering,\r\nwater might be poured into the entrance passage, and remain long enough\r\nstanding at the corner (so to speak) where this passage and the\r\nsuggested ascending passage could meet, for Alpha Draconis to be\r\nobserved down the ascending passage. Fig. 2 shows what is meant. Here D\r\nC is the descending passage, C A the ascending passage, C the corner\r\nwhere the water would be placed when Alpha Draconis was about to pass\r\nbelow the pole. The observer would look down A C, and would see Alpha\r\nDraconis by rays which had passed down D C, and had been reflected by\r\nthe water at C. Supposing the building to have been erected, as Lepsius\r\nand other Egyptologists consider, at the rate of one layer in each year,\r\nthen only one observation of the kind described need be made per annum.\r\nIndeed, fewer would serve, since three or four layers of stone might be\r\nadded without any fresh occasion arising to test the direction of the\r\npassage C A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to remind those who have given any attention to\r\nthe subject of the pyramid that there is precisely such an ascending\r\npassage as C A, and that as yet no explanation of the identity of its\r\nangle of ascent with the angle of descent of the passage D C has ever\r\nbeen given. Most pyramidalists content themselves by assuming, as Sir E.\r\nBeckett puts it, \"that the same angle would probably be used for both\r\nsets of passages, _as there was no reason for varying it_,\" which is not\r\nexactly an explanation of the relation. Mr. Wacherbarth has suggested\r\nthat the passages were so adjusted for the purpose of managing a system\r\nof balance cars united by ropes from one passage to another; but this\r\nexplanation is open, as Beckett points out, to the fatal objection that\r\nthe passages meet at their lowest point, not at their highest, so that\r\nit would be rather a puzzle \"to work out the mechanical idea.\" The\r\nreflection explanation is not only open to no such objections, but\r\ninvolves precisely such an application of optical laws as we should\r\nexpect from men so ingenious as the pyramid builders certainly were. In\r\nsaying this, let me explain, I am not commending myself for ingenuity in\r\nthinking of the method, simply because such methods are quite common and\r\nfamiliar in the astronomy of modern times.\r\n\r\nWhile I find this explanation, which occurred to me even while this\r\npaper was in writing, so satisfactory that I feel almost tempted to say,\r\nlike Sir G. Airy of his explanation of the Deluge as an overflow of the\r\nNile, that \"I cannot entertain the slightest doubt\" of its validity, I\r\nfeel that there ought to be some evidence in the descending passage\r\nitself of the use of this method. We might not find any traces of the\r\nplugs used to stop up, once a year or so, the rock part of the\r\ndescending passage. For they would be only temporary arrangements. But\r\nwe should expect to find the floor of the descending passage constructed\r\nwith special care, and very closely fitted, where the water was to be\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nInquiring whether this is so, I find not only that it is, but that\r\nanother hitherto unexplained feature of the great pyramid finds its\r\nexplanation in this way,--the now celebrated \"secret sign.\" Let us read\r\nProfessor Smyth's account of this peculiar feature:--\r\n\r\n     \"When measuring the cross-joints in the floor of the\r\n     entrance-passage, in 1865, I went on chronicling their angles, each\r\n     one proving to be very nearly at right angles to the axis, until\r\n     suddenly one came which was _diagonal_; another, and that was\r\n     diagonal too; but, after that, the rectangular position was\r\n     resumed. Further, the stone material carrying these diagonal joints\r\n     was harder and better than elsewhere in the floor, so as to have\r\n     saved that part from the monstrous excavations elsewhere\r\n     perpetrated by some moderns. Why, then, did the builders change the\r\n     rectangular joint angle at that point, and execute such unusual\r\n     angles as they chose in place of it, in a better material of stone\r\n     than elsewhere; and yet with so little desire to call general\r\n     attention to it, that they made the joints fine and close to that\r\n     degree that they escaped the attention of all men until 1865 A.D.\r\n     The answer came from the diagonal joints themselves, on discovering\r\n     that the stone between them was opposite to the butt end of the\r\n     portcullis of the first ascending passage, or to the hole whence\r\n     the prismatic stone of concealment through 3000 years had dropped\r\n     out almost before Al Mamoun's eyes. Here, therefore, was a secret\r\n     sign in the pavement of the entrance-passage, appreciable only to a\r\n     careful eye and a measurement by angle, but made in such hard\r\n     material that it was evidently intended to last to the end of human\r\n     time with the great pyramid, and _has_ done so thus far.\"\r\n\r\nWhether Professor Smyth is right in considering that this\r\nspecially-prepared position of the floor was intended not for any\r\npractical purpose, but to escape the notice of the careless, while yet,\r\nwhen the right men \"at last, duly instructed, entered the passage,\" this\r\nmysterious floor-sign should show them where a ceiling-stone was\r\nmovable, on perceiving which they \"would have laid bare the beginning of\r\nthe whole train of those sub-aërial features of construction which are\r\nthe great pyramid's most distinctive glory, and exist in no other\r\npyramid in Egypt or the world,\" I leave the reader to judge. I would\r\nremark, only, that, if so, the builders of the pyramid were not\r\nremarkably good prophets, seeing that the event befell otherwise, the\r\nceiling-stone dropping out a thousand years or so before the floor-sign\r\nwas noticed; wherefore we need not feel altogether alarmed at their own\r\nprediction (according to Professor Smyth), that the end of the world is\r\nto come in 1881, even as Mother Shipton also is reported to have\r\nprophesied. For my own part, I am quite content with my own\r\ninterpretation of the secret sign; as showing where the floor of the\r\ndescending passage was purposely prepared for the reception of water, on\r\nthe still surface of which the Pole-star of the day might be mirrored\r\nfor one looking down the ascending passage.\r\n\r\nAlbeit, I cannot but think that this ascending passage must also have\r\nbeen so directed as to show some bright star when due south. For if the\r\npassage had only given the meridian plane, but without permitting the\r\nastronomer to observe the southing of any fixed star, it would have\r\nsubserved only one-half its purposes as a meridional instrument. It is\r\nto be remembered that, supposing the ascending passage to have its\r\nposition determined in the way I have described, there would be nothing\r\nto prevent its being also made to show any fixed star nearly at the same\r\nelevation. For it could readily be enlarged in a vertical direction, the\r\nfloor remaining unaltered. Since it is not enlarged until the great\r\ngallery is reached (at a distance of nearly 127 feet from the place\r\nwhere the ascent begins), it follows, or is at least rendered highly\r\nprobable, that some bright star was in view through that ascending\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nNow, taking the date 2170 B.C., which Professor Smyth assigns to the\r\nbeginning of the great pyramid, or even taking any date (as we fairly\r\nmay), within a century or so on either side of that date, we find no\r\nbright star which would have been visible when due south, through the\r\nascending passage. I have calculated the position of that circle among\r\nthe stars along which lay all the points passing 26° 18' above the\r\nhorizon when due south, in the latitude of Ghizeh, 2170 years before the\r\nChristian era; and it does not pass near a single conspicuous star.[45]\r\nThere is only one fourth magnitude star which it actually\r\napproaches--namely, Epsilon Ceti; and one fifth magnitude star, Beta of\r\nthe Southern Crown.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that Egyptologists almost without exception assert that\r\nthe date of the builders of the great pyramid _must_ have been more than\r\na thousand years earlier than 2170 B.C., and that Bunsen has assigned to\r\nMenes the date 3620 B.C., while the date 3300 B.C. has been assigned to\r\nCheops or Suphis on apparently good authority, we are led to inquire\r\nwhether the other epoch when Alpha Draconis was at about the right\r\ndistance from the pole of the heavens may not have been the true era of\r\nthe commencement of the great pyramid. Now, the year 3300 B.C., though a\r\nlittle late, would accord fairly well with the time when Alpha Draconis\r\nwas at the proper distance 3-2/3° from the pole of the heavens. If the\r\ninclination of the entrance-passage is 26° 27', as Professor Smyth made\r\nit, the exact date for this would be 3390 B.C.; if 26° 40', as others\r\nmade it before his measurements, the date would be about 3320 B.C.,\r\nwhich would suit well with the date 3300 B.C., since a century either\r\nway would only carry the star about a third of a degree towards or from\r\nthe pole.\r\n\r\nNow, when we inquire whether in the year 3300 B.C. any bright star would\r\nhave been visible, at southing, through the ascending passage, we find\r\nthat a very bright star indeed, an orb otherwise remarkable as the\r\nnearest of all the stars, the brilliant Alpha Centauri, shone as it\r\ncrossed the meridian right down that ascending tube. It is so bright\r\nthat, viewed through that tube, it must have been visible to the naked\r\neye, even when southing in full daylight.\r\n\r\nBut thirdly, we must consider how the builders of the pyramid would\r\narrange for the observation of the sun at noon on every clear day in the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThey would carry up the floor of the ascending passage in an unchanged\r\ndirection, as it already pointed south of the lowest place of the noon\r\nsun at mid-winter. They would have to turn the tunnel into a lofty\r\ngallery, to increase the vertical range of view on the meridian. It\r\nseems reasonable to infer that they would prefer so to arrange matters\r\nthat the upper end of the gallery would be near the middle of the\r\nplatform which would form the top of the pyramidal structure from the\r\ntime when it was completed for observational purposes. The height of the\r\ngallery would be so adjusted to its length, that the mid-winter's sun\r\nwould not shine further than the lower end of the gallery (that is, to\r\nthe upper end of the smaller ascending passage). In fact, as the moon\r\nand planets would have to be observed when due south, through this\r\nmeridional gallery, and as they range further from the equator both\r\nnorth and south than the sun does, it would be necessary that the\r\ngallery should extend lower down than the sun's mid-winter noon rays\r\nwould shine.\r\n\r\nAs it would be a part of the observer's work to note exactly how far\r\ndown the gallery the shadow of its upper southern edge reached, as well\r\nas the moment when the sun's light passed from the western to the\r\neastern wall of the gallery, and other details of the kind; besides, of\r\ncourse, taking time-observations of the moment when the sun's edge\r\nseemed to reach the edge of the gallery's southern opening; and as such\r\nobservations could not be properly made by men standing on the smooth\r\nslanting floor of the gallery, it would be desirable to have\r\ncross-benches capable of being set at different heights along the\r\nsloping gallery. In some observations, indeed, as where the transits of\r\nseveral stars southing within short intervals of time had to be\r\nobserved, it would be necessary to set some observers at one part of the\r\ngallery, others at another part, and perhaps even to have several sets\r\nof observers along the gallery. And this suggests yet another\r\nconsideration. It might be thought desirable, if great importance was\r\nattached (as the whole building shows that great importance must have\r\nbeen attached) to the exactness of the observations, to have several\r\nobservations of each transit of a star across the mouth of the gallery.\r\nIn this case, it would be well to have the breadth of the gallery\r\ndifferent at different heights, though its walls must of necessity be\r\nupright throughout--that is, the walls must be upright from the height\r\nwhere one breadth commences, to the height where the next breadth\r\ncommences. With a gallery built in this fashion, it would be possible to\r\ntake several observations of the same transit, somewhat in the same way\r\nthat the modern observer watches the transit of a star across each of\r\nfive, seven, or nine parallel spider threads, in order to obtain a more\r\ncorrect time for the passage of the star across the middle thread, than\r\nif he noted this passage alone.\r\n\r\nHow far the grand gallery corresponds with these requirements can be\r\njudged from the following description given by Professor Greaves in\r\n1638:--\"It is,\" he says, \"a very stately piece of work, and not\r\ninferior, either in respect of the curiosity of art, or richness of\r\nmaterials, to the most sumptuous and magnificent buildings,\" and a\r\nlittle further on he says, \"this gallery, or corridor, or whatever else\r\nI may call it, is built of white and polished marble (limestone), the\r\nwhich is very evenly cut in spacious squares or tables. Of such\r\nmaterials as is the pavement, such is the roof and such are the side\r\nwalls that flank it; the coagmentation or knitting of the joints is so\r\nclose, that they are scarce discernible to a curious eye; and that which\r\nadds grace to the whole structure, though it makes the passage the more\r\nslippery and difficult, is the acclivity or rising of the ascent. The\r\nheight of this gallery is 26 feet\" (Professor Smyth's careful\r\nmeasurements show the true height to be more nearly 28 feet), \"the\r\nbreadth of 6.870 feet, of which 3.435 feet are to be allowed for the way\r\nin the midst, which is set and bounded on both sides with two banks\r\n(like benches) of sleek and polished stone; each of these hath 1.717 of\r\na foot in breadth, and as much in depth.\" These measurements are not\r\nstrictly exact. Smyth made the breadth of the gallery above the banks or\r\nramps as he calls them, 6 feet 10-1/5 inches; the space between the\r\nramps, 3 feet 6 inches; the ramps nearly about 1 foot 8-1/14 inches\r\nbroad, and nearly 1 foot 9 inches high, measured transversely, that is\r\nat right angles to the ascending floor.\r\n\r\nAs to arrangements for the convenience of observers in the slippery and\r\ndifficult floor of this gallery, we find that upon the top of these\r\nbenches or ramps, near the angle where they meet the wall, \"there are\r\nlittle spaces cut in right-angled parallel figures, set on each side\r\nopposite one another, _intended no question for some other end than\r\nornament_.\"\r\n\r\nThe diversity of width which I have indicated as a desirable feature in\r\na meridional gallery, is a marked feature of the actual gallery. \"In the\r\ncasting and ranging of the marbles\" (limestone), \"in both the side\r\nwalls, there is one piece of architecture,\" says Greaves, \"in my\r\njudgment very graceful, and that is that all the courses or stones,\r\nwhich are but seven (so great are these stones), do set and flag over\r\none another about three inches; the bottom of the uppermost course\r\noverlapping the top of the next, and so in order, the rest as they\r\ndescend.\" The faces of these stones are exactly vertical, and as the\r\nwidth of the gallery diminishes upwards by about six inches for each\r\nsuccessive course, it follows that the width at the top is about 3-1/2\r\nfeet less than the width, 6 feet 10-1/5 inches, at the bottom, or agrees\r\nin fact with the width of the space between the benches or ramps. Thus\r\nthe shadow of the vertical edges of the gallery at solar noon just\r\nreached to the edges of the ramps, the shadow of the next lower\r\nvertical edges falling three inches from the edges higher up the ramps,\r\nthose of the next vertical edges six inches from these edges, still\r\nhigher up, and so forth. The true hour of the sun's southing could thus\r\nbe most accurately determined by seven sets of observers placed in\r\ndifferent parts of the gallery, and near mid-summer, when the range of\r\nthe shadows would be so far shortened, that a smaller number of\r\nobservers only could follow the shadows' motions; but in some respects,\r\nthe observations in this part of the year could be more readily and\r\nexactly made than in winter, when the shadows' spaces of various width\r\nwould range along the entire length of the gallery.\r\n\r\nSimilar remarks would apply to observations of the moon, which could\r\nalso be directly observed. The planets and stars of course could only be\r\nobserved directly.\r\n\r\nThe grand gallery could be used for the observation of any celestial\r\nbody southing higher than 26° 18' above the horizon; but not very\r\neffectively for objects passing near the zenith. The Pleiades could be\r\nwell observed. They southed about 63-2/3° above the horizon in the year\r\n2140 B.C. or thereabouts when they were on the equinoctial colure.[46]\r\nBut if I am right in taking the year 3300 B.C. when Alpha Centauri shone\r\ndown the smaller ascending passage in southing, the Pleiades were about\r\n58° only above the horizon when southing, and therefore even more\r\nfavourably observable from the great meridional gallery.\r\n\r\nIn passing I may note that at this time, about 3300 years before our\r\nera, the equinoctial point (that is, the point where the sun passes\r\nnorth of the equator, and the year begins according to the old manner of\r\nreckoning) was midway between the horns of the Bull. So that then, and\r\nthen alone, a poet might truly speak of spring as the time\r\n\r\n  \"Candidus auratis aperit quum cornibus annum\r\n  Taurus.\"\r\n\r\nas Virgil incorrectly did (repeating doubtless some old tradition) at a\r\nlater time. Even Professor Smyth notices the necessity that the pyramid\r\ngallery should correspond in some degree with such a date. \"For,\" says\r\nhe, \"there have been traditions for long, whence arising I know not,\r\nthat the seven overlappings of the grand gallery, so impressively\r\ndescribed by Professor Greaves, had something to do with the Pleiades,\r\nthose proverbially seven stars of the primeval world,\" only that he\r\nconsiders the pyramid related to _memorial_ not _observing_ astronomy,\r\n\"of an earlier date than Virgil's.\" The Pleiades also, it may be\r\nremarked, were scarcely regarded in old times as belonging to the\r\nconstellation of the Bull, but formed a separate asterism.\r\n\r\nThe upper end of the great gallery lies very near the vertical axis of\r\nthe pyramid. It is equidistant, in fact, from the north and south edges\r\nof the pyramid platform at this level, but lies somewhat to the east of\r\nthe true centre of this platform. One can recognise a certain\r\nconvenience in this arrangement, for the actual centre of the platform\r\nwould be required as a position from whence observation of the whole sky\r\ncould be made. Observers stationed there would have the cardinal points\r\nand the points midway between them defined by the edges and angles of\r\nthe square platform, which would not be the case if they were displaced\r\nfrom the centre. Stationed as they would be close to the mouth of the\r\ngallery, they would hear the time signallings given forth by the\r\nobservers placed at various parts of the gallery; and no doubt one chief\r\nend of the exact time-observations for which the gallery was manifestly\r\nconstructed, would be to enable the platform observers duly to record\r\nthe time when various phenomena were noticed in any part of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThis corresponds well with the statement made by Proclus, that the\r\npyramids of Egypt, which, according to Diodorus Siculus, had been in\r\nexistence during 3600 years, terminated in a platform upon which the\r\npriests made their celestial observations. The last-named historian\r\nalleges, also (Biblioth. Hist. Lib. I.), that the Egyptians, who claimed\r\nto be the most ancient of men, professed to be acquainted with the\r\nsituation of the earth, the risings and settings of stars, to have\r\narranged the order of days and months, and pretended to be able to\r\npredict future events, with certainty, from their observations of\r\ncelestial phenomena. I think that it is in this association of astrology\r\nwith astronomy that we find the explanation of what, after all, remains\r\nthe great mystery of the pyramid--the fact, namely, that all the\r\npassages, ascending, descending, and horizontal, constructed with such\r\nextreme care, and at the cost of so much labour, in the interior of the\r\ngreat pyramid, were eventually (perhaps not very long after their\r\nconstruction) to be closed up. I reject utterly the idea that they could\r\nhave been constructed merely as memorials. Sir E. Beckett, who seems\r\nwilling to admit this conception, rejects the notion that the builders\r\nof the pyramid recorded \"standard measures by hiding them with the\r\nutmost ingenuity.\" Is it not equally absurd to imagine that they\r\nrecorded the date of the great pyramid, by construction, by those most\r\nelaborately concealed passages? Why they should have concealed them\r\nafter constructing them so carefully, may not be clear. For my own part,\r\nI regard the theory that the Pyramid of Suphis was built for\r\nastrological observations, relating to the life of that monarch only, as\r\naffording the most satisfactory explanation yet advanced of the\r\nmysterious circumstance that the building was closed up after his death.\r\nSupposing the part of the edifice (fifty layers in all), which includes\r\nthe ascending and descending passages, to have been erected during his\r\nlifetime, it may be that some reverential or superstitious feeling\r\ncaused his successors, or the priesthood, to regard the building as\r\nsacred after his death--to be closed up therefore and completed as a\r\nperfect pyramid, polished _ad unguem_ from its pointed summit to the\r\nlines along which the four faces met the smooth pavement round its base.\r\nWe might thus explain why each monarch required his own astrological\r\nobservatory afterwards to become his tomb. Be this as it may, it is\r\ncertain that the pyramids were constructed for astronomical\r\nobservations; and it would, I conceive, be utterly unreasonable to\r\nimagine that the costly interior fittings and arrangements, \"not\r\ninferior, in respect of curiosity of art or richness of materials, to\r\nthe most sumptuous and magnificent buildings,\" were intended to subserve\r\nno other purpose but to be memorials; and that, too, not until, in the\r\ncourse of thousands of years, the whole mass of the pyramid had begun to\r\nlose the exactness of its original figure.\r\n\r\n  R. A. PROCTOR.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] It seems to me not improbable that the level was determined by\r\nsimply flooding (though to a very small depth only, of course) the\r\nentire area to be levelled--not only the pavement level, but higher\r\nlevels as the pyramid was raised layer by layer. By completing the\r\noutside of each layer first, an enclosed space capable of receiving the\r\nwater would be formed (the flooding being required once only for each\r\nlayer), and when the level had been taken the water could be allowed to\r\nrun off by the interior passages to the well which Piazzi Smyth\r\nconsiders to be symbolical of the bottomless pit.\r\n\r\n[44] The irregular descending passage long known as the well, which\r\ncommunicates between the ascending passage and the underground chamber,\r\nenables us to ascertain how high the rock rises into the pyramid at this\r\nparticular part of the base. We thus learn that the rock rises in this\r\nplace, at any rate, thirty or forty feet above the basal plane.\r\n\r\n[45] There is a statement perfectly startling in its inaccuracy, in a\r\nchapter of Blake's \"Astronomical Myths,\" derived from Mr. Haliburton's\r\nresearches, asserting that in the year 2170 B.C. the Pleiades were\r\n\"_exactly at that height that they could be seen in the direction of the\r\nSouthward-pointing passage of the pyramid_.\" The italics are not mine.\r\nAs this passage pointed 33-2/3°, or thereabouts, below (that is south\r\nof) the equator, and the Pleiades were then some 3-2/3° north of the\r\nequator, the passage certainly did not then point to the Pleiades. Nor\r\nhas there been any time since the world began when the Pleiades were\r\nanywhere near the direction of the southward pointing passage. In fact\r\nthey have never been more than 20° south of the equator. The statement\r\nfollows immediately after another to the surprising effect that in the\r\nyear 2170 B.C. \"the Pleiades _really_ commenced the spring by their\r\nmidnight culmination.\" The only comment an astronomer can make on this\r\nstartling assertion is to repeat with emphasis the word italicized by\r\nMr. Haliburton (or Mr. Blake?). The Pleiades being then in conjunction\r\nwith what is now called the first point of Aries, culminated at noon,\r\nnot at midnight, at the time of the vernal equinox.\r\n\r\n[46] This date is sometimes given earlier, but when account is taken of\r\nthe proper motion of these stars we get about the date above mentioned.\r\nI cannot understand how Dr. Ball, Astronomer Royal for Ireland, has\r\nobtained the date 2248 B.C., unless he has taken the proper motion of\r\nAlcyone the wrong way. The proper motion of this star during the last\r\n4000 years has been such as to increase the star's distance from the\r\nequinoctial colure; and therefore, of course, the actual interval of\r\ntime since the star was on the colure is less than it would be\r\ncalculated to be if the proper motion were neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSPIRACIES IN RUSSIA UNDER THE REIGNING CZAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nMuch astonishment has been expressed of late, by those who are too apt\r\nto forget the main facts even of contemporary history, that under \"so\r\nbenevolent a prince as Alexander II.\" the most fearful conspiracies\r\nshould have become rife. This view of the situation shows a\r\nmisconception of the whole system of government in Russia, and more\r\nespecially of the character of the ruling Autocrat, as it has been\r\nformed by his education and by the ever-worsening course of his reign.\r\nFor the proper understanding of what has occurred within the last twelve\r\nyears or so, we must consequently go back for a moment to Alexander's\r\nearly training and antecedents. No despotic system can be judged without\r\na knowledge of personal facts relating to its bearer. A sketch of the\r\ncharacter of Alexander II. and of his strange acts of \"benevolence,\"\r\nwill make it clear to the commonest comprehension why his antagonists\r\nshould at last have met him by wild deeds of conspiracy.\r\n\r\nAlexander's arbitrary bias may be said to have been inherited in his\r\nblood. A disposition, originally, perhaps, less severe than that of\r\nNicholas, was darkened and vitiated in him from his early days. Custine\r\nalready remarked the expression of deep melancholy in the Grand Duke;\r\nand all those who have seen Alexander II. since have been struck with\r\nhis sour and sullen morosity. No smile ever lights up this \"humane\"\r\nCzar's face. His uneasy glance is that of the misanthrope; his brow\r\nseems overcast as with the lowering shadow of a tragic fate. The harsh\r\nway in which he was brought up by his martinet father, without the\r\nslightest regard for his somewhat delicate health, no doubt laid a\r\nfoundation for this pensive sadness, which, under a pernicious Court\r\natmosphere, and with the terrible recollections crowding about his\r\nfamily history, gradually changed into the fierceness of the Tyrant.\r\n\r\nPoor royal humanity is sometimes strangely led up to its task in life.\r\nAlmost from infancy the sickly boy had to don the soldier's uniform. All\r\njoyous sprightliness was crushed out of the infantine heir of a\r\nbarbarous Imperialism. His education by the crowned corporal who\r\nhappened to be his parent, appeared to aim mainly at making him\r\nphysically and in character as rigid as a ramrod. By nature of a\r\nsensuous bent, he had to undergo all the ordeals of barrack-room\r\npractices, which Nicholas held to be the proper sum and substance of\r\nhuman life.\r\n\r\nThe stern nature and teaching of that typical tyrant came out one day in\r\na striking manner during the early boyhood of Alexander. Even Imperial\r\nchildren do not seem to be able to shake off the dark historical\r\nrecollections that hang about the Winter Palace. In the manner of\r\nchildren they will make a ghastly sport of them. Once, when they were in\r\na specially jocular mood, Alexander, in company with his brother\r\nConstantine and some comrades in play, enacted--as youngsters in their\r\napishly imitative mood will do--one of the most hideous scenes that\r\nconcluded a previous reign. The throttling of the Emperor Paul was the\r\nsubject! Alexander, standing for Paul, was assaulted and thrown down by\r\nhis brother, who knelt upon his chest. With the aid of the sportive\r\naccomplices, a cord was passed round the victim's throat. It is said\r\nthat young Constantine took a malicious pleasure in putting into this\r\nsemblance of strangulation rather an unexpected deal of energy.\r\n\r\n\"For mercy's sake! For mercy's sake!\" Alexander cried, with half-stifled\r\nvoice, and at last with a fearful yell.\r\n\r\nNicholas, hurrying out from his room, beheld the spectacle before him in\r\ndeep consternation. When the matter was explained to him, he severely\r\nreproved and actually punished his eldest-born. \"It is not worthy of an\r\nEmperor,\" he said, \"to call out for mercy!\"\r\n\r\nThis well-authenticated anecdote has been told by writers who expressed\r\nthe most adulatory sentiments towards the present Czar. It is to be\r\nfound in Castille's highly flattering biography of Alexander II.,\r\npublished about the time of his accession to the throne. The incident,\r\nloathsome as it must appear to every sensitive mind, strikingly paints\r\nboth the gloom that always hangs about the Russian Court, and the kind\r\nof education given by Nicholas to his offspring.\r\n\r\nThe youthful despotic propensities of Alexander may be seen from an\r\naccount given by another of his admiring biographers, Mr. J. G.\r\nHesekiel. This writer enthusiastically swings the censer before Nicholas\r\nas the \"Iron Knight of Legitimacy\" and the \"Invincible Champion of\r\nGovernment by the Grace of God.\" (I may mention in passing that Mr.\r\nHesekiel has done the life of Prince Bismarck into similar adulatory\r\nprose). At the age of fourteen--he relates--the boy-prince, Alexander,\r\nin going through a state room of the Palace, was respectfully greeted by\r\nthe assembled high dignitaries of the Empire, senators, generals, and\r\nso forth. They all rose and bowed before the Heir-Apparent. The boy's\r\nvanity being flattered, he purposely came back several times, expecting\r\nthe grey-beards on each occasion to rise and salaam before him. When he\r\nfound that they thought they had done their duty by the first\r\nsalutation, he angrily complained against them to his father. Nicholas,\r\nhowever, blamed the son for his unreasonable exaction. This vicious\r\narrogance of the boy ripened afterwards into the haughtiness of the\r\ndespot, being but slightly mitigated by a naturally melancholy\r\ndisposition, which sometimes gave the appearance of comparative\r\nsoftness.\r\n\r\nOf Constantine, the second son of Nicholas, there is a further\r\ncharacteristic anecdote on record. It is to be found even in\r\npublications otherwise marked by servile feelings towards the Court. We\r\nall know at what a supernaturally early age the purple-born are\r\nappointed to high titular positions in the State Administration or in\r\nthe army. In Russia, where the \"right divine of kings to govern wrong\"\r\nis pushed to its most logical or illogical consequences, this royal\r\ncustom flourishes to excess. At the mature age of eight, Alexander was\r\nappointed Chancellor of the University of Finland. His brother\r\nConstantine was nominated in early youth High Admiral of the Fleet. One\r\nday, Constantine, between whom and his elder brother there was little\r\nlove lost, had Alexander arrested because he had come on board ship\r\nwithout special authorization. Something of the sentiment of Franz Moor,\r\nin Schiller's _Robbers_, seems to have animated Constantine in his\r\nyouth. He was often heard to utter a malediction against the law of\r\nheredity. He declared that, being born when his father (Nicholas) was\r\nalready on the throne, he (Constantine) had a better right of succession\r\nthan Alexander, who had been born when Nicholas was only a Grand Duke.\r\nHe further said that, after the death of Nicholas, he would contend\r\nagainst Alexander with the object of partitioning the Empire.\r\n\r\nThese may seem trifling occurrences--mere freaks of childhood. They\r\nwould certainly be so regarded in countries where the nation practically\r\npossesses self-government and the Crown is mainly an ornamental cipher,\r\nor where the sovereign privilege is at least largely circumscribed by\r\nthe parliamentary power. It is different in an Empire like Russia, with\r\nits murderous dynastic antecedents. There, the personal character of the\r\nprincely personages is of the utmost importance; for a youthful freak or\r\nhideous trick may point to a coming horrible event. In olden times,\r\nprevious to the Tatar dominion, Russia passed through the so-called\r\nAppanage Period of Separate Principalities, when the Empire was actually\r\npartitioned. The feuds which then tore the various branches of the Rurik\r\nfamily greatly facilitated the Mongol conquest that weighed upon the\r\ncountry for centuries. With the condition of Russia such as it was until\r\nlately, and still is for that matter, a bold attempt on the part of a\r\nPrince second in birth could not be said to be beyond the range of\r\npossibility. Even now we hear of a deep estrangement between the ruling\r\nAutocrat and the Czarewitch, reaching even to such an extent that for a\r\nmoment there was an intention of arresting the latter.\r\n\r\nNothing has come of the childish threat of the Grand Duke Constantine,\r\nwho to this day fills the post of Admiral-General of the Russian Fleet.\r\nStill, the incident alluded to has its value. When a whole nation is\r\ndisinherited from political rights, a younger member of the ruling\r\nHouse, of violent and ambitious temper, may easily take the idea into\r\nhis head of altering, by a palace plot, the very basis of the Empire for\r\nhis own special benefit. What looks like boyish play may in time to come\r\nturn into a tragedy. These dangers, characteristic of all autocracies,\r\ncan only be done away with by the introduction of a settled order of\r\nConstitutional law, conferring the chief power in the State upon\r\nrepresentative bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe death of Nicholas, shortly before the end of the Crimean War,\r\nremains to this day enshrouded in darkness and doubt.\r\n\r\nHis proud spirit had been deeply humiliated by a series of defeats. He\r\nwho once posed as the arbiter of the destinies of Continental Europe had\r\nbeen beaten, not only by the Western Allies, but, before that, even by\r\nthe Turks single-handed. He wrathfully avowed that \"he had been deceived\r\nas to the state of public opinion in England.\" The messengers of the\r\nPeace Society, the language held by the organs of the Manchester school,\r\nhad emboldened him to try to realize the secular dream of Russian\r\ndespots,--namely, the conquest of Constantinople. The disenchantment he\r\nexperienced gave even his iron frame a terrible shock. Yet his haughty\r\ntemper forbade him to entertain offers of, still more to sue for, peace.\r\nThose surrounding him, including his nearest by kinship, were afraid of\r\nangering the ruthless man by unwelcome counsel.\r\n\r\nAt the same time vague murmurs were heard in society against the\r\nabsolutistic _régime_ which had led Russia to the brink of utter ruin.\r\nFrom the southern part of the Empire, where opinion, since the days of\r\nCossack and Ukraine independence, had always been the most advanced,\r\nthreatening tales came up of a spirit of rebellion among the peasantry,\r\nupon whom the relay duties and other hardships connected with the war\r\nweighed most heavily. There was a universal feeling that the removal of\r\nNicholas from this world's stage would be a blessing.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this darkening situation men learnt that the Czar was\r\nslightly indisposed; immediately afterwards, that he was--_dead_. He had\r\nonly taken a cold; but the illness--as the manifesto of Alexander II.\r\nafterwards said--\"developed itself with incredible rapidity.\" The\r\nmanifesto added:--\"Let us bow before the mysterious decrees of\r\nProvidence!\"\r\n\r\nWas the mystery a real or merely an apparent one?\r\n\r\nAbroad a rumour quickly spread of foul play having once more taken\r\nplace in the Winter Palace. In the German and the Danish press--for\r\ninstance, in the Copenhagen _Faedrelandet_, and the Berlin _National\r\nZeitung_ and _Volks-Zeitung_--surmises were openly uttered that the\r\nRussian Emperor had died from poison. Not a few thought he had fallen a\r\nvictim to a palace plot in the interest of the maintenance of the\r\ndynasty which was endangered by his obstinacy. In a medical journal of\r\nthis country it was shown that the bulletins concerning the course of\r\nhis illness were, at all events, quite at variance with well-known\r\nphysiological laws. In a lithographed pamphlet--attributed to Dr. Mandt,\r\nthe physician-in-ordinary to Nicholas--it was alleged that the Czar, in\r\na fit of life-weariness, had himself asked for strychnine, and forced\r\nhis physician to prepare it for him. A noted Russian writer, Mr. Ivan\r\nGolovin, in a book published at Leipzig about eight years ago,[47]\r\nrefers to the statement of this pamphlet. He himself remarks that the\r\nreason for the head of the Emperor having been covered up, when lying in\r\nstate, was, that his features were so terribly disfigured by the poison\r\nas to render it advisable to conceal the face.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to unravel the truth. This much can, however, be said\r\nbeyond mere probability, that, if Nicholas had not been suddenly taken\r\naway, the contrast between his iron rule at home and his continued\r\ndefeats on the field of battle would have roused a spirit of rebellion\r\nand mutiny very similar to that against which he had to contend in the\r\nensanguined streets of the capital at the beginning of his reign. As it\r\nwas, men expected that his successor would prove more pliant. The\r\nprevailing feeling of dissatisfaction did not, therefore, at first\r\nassume a revolutionary shape.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was a consciousness of being surrounded by men who watched\r\nhim closely which made Alexander II. speak out in rather a peremptory\r\ntone in his manifesto of March 2, 1855. Monarchs who fear an attack upon\r\ntheir sovereign privileges often seek to terrify their would-be\r\nantagonists by bold language. \"I hereby declare solemnly,\" Alexander\r\nsaid, \"that I will remain faithful to all the views of my father, and\r\n_persevere in the line of political principles_ which have served as\r\nguiding maxims both to my uncle, Alexander I., and to him. These\r\nprinciples are those of the Holy Alliance. If that Alliance no longer\r\nexists, it is certainly not the fault of my august father.\" The fling\r\nagainst Austria, which had half taken the side of the Western Allies in\r\nthe Crimean War, and the covert reference to Prussia, which had refused\r\nmaking common military cause with Russia, was unmistakable.\r\n\r\nSo far as public opinion existed then, or could make itself heard in the\r\nCzar's Empire, the impression of this manifesto was a highly\r\nunfavourable one. Its allusions to the maintenance of the political\r\nprinciples of Nicholas and to the maxims of the Holy Alliance were\r\nlittle relished--all the less so, because there was not a word about\r\ncoming reforms. Military preparations were continued. The whole country\r\nseemed to be destined to become a military camp. No prospects were held\r\nout either of the emancipation of the serfs, or of the admission of any\r\nsection of the nation to a share in the Government.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, Alexander II. had to alter his tone. The wave of public\r\ndiscontent rising ever higher, whilst the Russian arms suffered defeat\r\nafter defeat, peace had to be concluded, and the full stringency of the\r\ndespotic rule could no longer be maintained. Gortschakoff was\r\nsubstituted for Nesselrode in the Chancellorship. At that time this was\r\nalmost considered progress--so unspeakably degrading was the slavery of\r\nthe nation, and so apt are men in their despair to catch at a straw.\r\n\r\nGortschakoff, nevertheless, pronounced the famous saying, \"_La Russie ne\r\nboude pas; elle se recueille!_\" The old war policy had been scotched,\r\nnot killed. Scarcely had the army returned from the campaign, before\r\nGovernment busied itself with a well-studied plan for a network of\r\nrailways, not in the commercial, but in the strategical interest. With\r\nthe same object of an ulterior return to the aggressive war policy,\r\nAlexander II. sought an interview with Napoleon III. soon after the\r\nconclusion of the Crimean War. Piedmont, also, was diplomatically\r\napproached in a remarkably friendly manner. England was to be isolated.\r\nRevenge was to be ultimately taken against her. Between all these\r\nsignificant, though somewhat weak attempts, the new Czar addressed to\r\nthe Marshals of the Polish nobility at Warsaw his threatening\r\nwords:--\"Before all, no dreams, gentlemen!... If need be, I shall know\r\nhow to punish with the utmost severity; and with the utmost severity I\r\nmean to punish!\" (\"_Avant tout, point de rêveries, messieurs!... Au\r\nbesoin, je saurai sévir, et je sévirai!_\")\r\n\r\nThus the autocratic vein strongly stood out even in this more sickly\r\ntype of a barbarous autocracy. It is the fashion at present, at least\r\namong some who take the name of \"philosophical Radicals\" in vain when\r\nthey curtsy before a Machiavellian tyrant, to dwell with admiring pride\r\nupon the philanthropic character of Alexander the Benevolent. All the\r\ncardinal virtues are his. He is the Liberator of the Serfs, the\r\nDeliverer of Downtrodden Nationalities, the Educator and Friend of the\r\nPeople--a monstrous paragon of princely perfection. The truth is that\r\nthis Czar, albeit lacking the nerve of his sire, has from early youth\r\nshown the full absolutistic bent. Dire necessity only brought him to the\r\naccomplishment of some reforms. But the evidence before us clearly shows\r\nthat in this he acted on the well-known lines of despotic calculation,\r\nand that he never did good without the intention of thereby preventing\r\nwhat to him appeared to be the greater evil for his position as an\r\nirresponsible autocrat, by the so-called \"Grace of God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nSo deeply shaken was the Empire by the events of 1853-56, that Alexander\r\ndid not dare for several years--in fact, not until 1863--to ordain any\r\nfresh recruitment for the army. This necessity greatly diminished the\r\noppressive power of the Crown. At the same time, public opinion showed\r\nsigns of a threatening unrest. An \"Underground Literature,\" as it was\r\ncalled, began once more to express the ideas of the better-educated,\r\nprogressive classes. Among the troops, the \"Songs of the Crimean\r\nSoldiers,\" by Tolstoy, an artillery officer, made a great stir. Count\r\nOrloff, then Minister of the Police, wrote to the Commanding-General in\r\nthe South, that he should silence these rebel songs. The General\r\nsomewhat bluntly replied, \"Please come yourself, and try to silence\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\nAmong the secret publications then in vogue there were some political\r\npoems of Pushkin, hitherto only known in clandestine manuscript form.\r\nPushkin is often called, with a great deal of exaggeration, the Russian\r\nByron, whereas others will only let him pass as a Byron travestied,\r\nwanting in originality, like most of his Russian brother-poets of the\r\nend of the last and the beginning of this century. At all events, one of\r\nPushkin's utterances containing the words,\r\n\r\n  \"I hate thee and thy race,\r\n  Thou autocratic villain,\"\r\n\r\ndoes not lack in allusive clearness. Secretly printed abroad, his\r\nwritings were largely propagated at Alexander the Second's accession.\r\nAgain, men like Lawroff--who, ten years later, was imprisoned as a\r\nsuspect, after Karakasoff's attempt against the life of the Czar--had\r\ncelebrated the advent of the successor of Nicholas with such ironically\r\nquestionable sentiments as this:--\r\n\r\n  \"Be proud, ye Russian men,\r\n  Of being the slaves of a Czar!\"\r\n\r\nWriters of comedies, novelists, delineators of the life of the people,\r\nultra-realistic and cynical describers of the criminal classes arose in\r\nrapid succession, whose tendency, one and all, was to show to what a\r\nstate of corruption Russian society, from top to bottom, had come under\r\nthe famous \"Champion of Order,\" the dreaded Nicholas. That Czar had been\r\nin the habit of speaking of Turkey as the Sick Man. Russia was now shown\r\nto be the Sick Man. Neither did St. Petersburg, Moscow or the other\r\nchief towns, alone serve as a theme for this kind of semi-political\r\nliterature. \"Provincial Sketches\" also came out in a similar strain.\r\nThese publications obtained an ever-increasing success among those\r\nclasses--few in number, it is true--which were able to read. A whole\r\n\"Revelation Literature\" sprang up, dealing with cases of governmental\r\ncorruption. The censorship could not be upheld any longer against these\r\nwriters with the strict severity of the previous reign. A beaten\r\nAbsolutism had to do things a little more cautiously; and the watchful\r\neyes of men hitherto treated like slaves quickly found out, with the\r\nrapid glance and intuition of the oppressed, that it was safe to \"dare\r\nit on\" a little more than they would have dreamt of doing before the end\r\nof the Crimean War. Truly, those Liberals in this country who now\r\ndenounce that war as a mistake and even a crime, do not know, or do not\r\ncare to remember, what a relief it brought to Russian Liberals\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nSoon after the death of Nicholas, desires, until then only muttered,\r\nwere publicly expressed for the recall and the amnesty of the Martyrs of\r\nthe Conspiracy and the Insurrection of December, 1825. Pestel, Ryleieff,\r\nBestujeff-Rumin, and the other leaders, had been strung up on the\r\ngallows. Many of those transported to Siberia had died a miserable\r\nfelon's death in the lead-mines. Brought up in the lap of luxury, they\r\nended like galley-slaves, because they had loved freedom more than\r\nwealth and ease. It is reported of one of the political prisoners, a\r\nnobleman, that he died in Kamtschatka with a chain round his neck,\r\nfastened to the wall. Others had been sent to the Caucasus, which in\r\nRussia was long ago said to be \"not so much a frontier as a grave-yard.\"\r\nThere they had fallen in a hateful war against brave, independent\r\nmountain tribes, as the unwilling tools of an aggressive tyranny. Still,\r\nsome of the sufferers were yet alive--among them men of the foremost\r\nfamilies of the country. They had to be allowed to come back. They\r\ncame--mere shadows and ruins of their former selves. But their decrepit\r\ncondition was the most telling evidence of the infamy of the Tyrant who\r\nhad fortunately passed away.\r\n\r\nIn the salons of the upper classes these suffering witnesses of a\r\nterrible past received lavish proofs of admiration. Men would listen\r\nwith sympathetic avidity to the tales of horror told by them. All those\r\npresent at such a gathering made it a point to be profuse towards the\r\nmartyrs with little attentions such as only women ordinarily receive\r\nfrom the other sex. Thirty years--a long time--had passed since the\r\narmed struggle in the streets of St. Petersburg. Now, all of a sudden,\r\nmemories were revived. Political tendencies, which some imagined had\r\ndied out, came up afresh among a younger generation, for whom the\r\n\"December Conspiracy\" was surrounded with a poetical halo. There was\r\ndanger in the air for the autocratic principle.\r\n\r\nCount Rostoptchin, the same who ordered the burning of Moscow in 1812,\r\nsaid in 1825 he could not understand that attempt at a revolution. He\r\n\"could understand the French Revolution, because there the ordinary\r\ncitizen wished to become an aristocrat, but he could not conceive\r\naristocrats wishing to become simple burghers.\" That was the version of\r\na cynical, though otherwise clever, member of the nobility, who was\r\nunable to comprehend the spirit of self-sacrifice for noble aims showing\r\nitself even among the wealthy and the \"noble\" by birth. However, had\r\nCount Rostoptchin only been capable of feeling the degradation under\r\nwhich the Russian aristocracy itself lies in its relations with a\r\ndespotic Crown, he might, even from his own point of view as a mere man\r\nof the world, have found a reason for the uprising of independent\r\ncharacters among men of his own rank.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe more cultured and wealthier classes again came to the front as\r\npolitical agitators, at the accession of Alexander. They wanted to throw\r\ndown the Chinese Wall which Nicholas had built around them--if it is not\r\nan insult to the Chinese to compare the wall they erected as a\r\nprotection against barbarism with the barrier set up by Nicholas against\r\nWestern ideas of culture and freedom. At first, Alexander II. did not\r\nhold out any hope of reform. Driven to straits, he busied himself with\r\nthrowing a sop to public opinion by various small relaxations in\r\nadministrative matters. They were small enough; and they were given with\r\na niggard hand.\r\n\r\nAnyone taking a survey of the earlier part of the reign of Alexander II.\r\nmust see that the main object of his government was to foil the tendency\r\ntowards the introduction of parliamentary institutions, which was\r\nsullenly but perceptibly making its way among the better educated\r\nsection of the nation; that, with the view of attaining this reactionary\r\nend, he pursued the traditional despotic policy of approaching the lower\r\nclasses on the one hand, and engaging the country in fresh warlike\r\nenterprise abroad on the other. Foiled in Europe by England and France,\r\nhe throws his armies, after the conclusion of the Peace of Paris, with\r\nrenewed fury upon the Tcherkess tribes. They had long barred the way of\r\nRussia towards Asia Minor and Persia, thereby insuring the safety of\r\nIndia from that side. Now Schamyl, the hoary-headed warrior-prophet, is\r\ncompelled to surrender in his last mountain stronghold. From his lofty\r\nAlpine home, which is filled with the renown of his romantic deeds, he\r\nis carried a prisoner to St. Petersburg, there to be stared at by the\r\ncrowd of decorated slaves of autocracy.\r\n\r\nWith this \"pacification\" of the Caucasus, the Czar obtained the\r\nunimpeded use of the high-road leading into Asia Minor. He then struck a\r\nblow against the independent tribes on the eastern shore of the Caspian.\r\nWith the Court of Teheran he entered into relations calculated to\r\nthreaten Turkey with a double danger from the Asiatic side, in case of a\r\nrenewal of war. Again, he enlarged his Empire, at the cost of China, by\r\nfilching territories as extensive as some of the greatest European\r\ncountries. In what once was Independent Turkestan, his armies overran\r\none Khanate after the other, thus coming nearer and nearer to India from\r\nthe north-west. There is a striking war-picture by Vereshagin, with a\r\npyramid of skulls as its centre--a very Golgotha of the horrors of\r\nmassacre; but Russian monarchs, in their ceaseless career of conquest,\r\nout-Tatar the Tatar in the fiendishness of their atrocities. Witness the\r\norder given by General Kaufmann, the pampered tool of Alexander II., in\r\nthese Turkestan campaigns:--\"_Kill all; spare no age, or sex!_\" Witness\r\nalso the death-dance that took place when his Majesty, the crowned head\r\nof Holy Russia, the magnanimous Champion of Religion and Humanity, made\r\nhis victorious entry into Plevna,[48] carousing there jubilantly,\r\nwhilst the Turkish wounded lay unattended in the town for fully two\r\ndays--a helpless mass of men, dying in raving agony.\r\n\r\nI have anticipated for a moment the course of events. In glancing at the\r\nreign of Alexander II., the eye involuntarily runs over the full\r\npanorama of tyrannic outrages. From the time of the wholesale\r\nproscription of the Tcherkess and Abchasian tribes to the heart-rending\r\nhorrors committed against Toork populations and wounded Ottoman\r\nprisoners of war, there has been, in his career, a perfect climax of\r\ninhumanity. Conferences for the professed humanization of warfare were,\r\nwith him, only the hypocritical precursors of fresh barbarities. But it\r\nis not necessary to forestall events. Enough was done in the way of\r\natrocities even in the earlier years of his rule.\r\n\r\nBetween the conquests made in the Caucasus and the annexations on the\r\nAmoor or in Central Asia, Alexander II. bullied, and at last put down,\r\nby unspeakably cruel means,--even as did his predecessor,--the national\r\naspirations of unhappy Poland. Like Nicholas, he kept the road to\r\nSiberia alive with the wretched convoys of unfortunate exiles. Even in\r\nthe Baltic Provinces, whence the Russian Government draws so many able\r\nadministrators, diplomatists, and military leaders, whose capacities\r\nmight be employed in a better cause, he began a system of persecution\r\nagainst the German population, of so galling a nature that it\r\nthreatened, in course of time, to alienate that very mainstay of the\r\npublic administration. The special towns' charters of the Baltic\r\nProvinces were infringed. The German tongue, hitherto possessing full\r\nprivileges, was threatened. A process of Russification was attempted;\r\nthe superior civilized element being pushed and annoyed by the inferior\r\nand barbarous one.\r\n\r\nThese acts of the earliest years of the reign of Alexander II. have to\r\nbe kept in mind, in order to understand that humanitarian motives were\r\nnot the ruling ones in the final adoption of the Serf Emancipation\r\nmeasure. On his death-bed, Nicholas is stated to have said to his\r\nson:-- \"Thou hast two enemies--the nobility and the Poles. Emancipate\r\nthe serfs; and do not allow the Poles any Constitution!\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, with the mystery which envelopes the last days of\r\nNicholas, to know whether these words are authentic. At all events,\r\nAlexander did not give back to the Poles the Constitution they\r\npossessed until 1830. Nor did he grant a Constitution to the Russians\r\neither. He emancipated the serfs--but not before the principles which\r\nhad actuated the Conspirators of 1817-25 once more began to show\r\nthemselves among the upper strata of society; and in passing his\r\nmeasure, he mainly sought to deprive a restive nobility of some of its\r\ninfluence, and to take the wind out of the sails of those Liberal\r\nagitators who would have made the abolition of bondage the outcome of\r\nthe establishment of a freely-chosen Legislature. When, finally, the\r\nPoles, counting upon a corresponding movement in Russia, resolved upon\r\nthat heroic, though desperate, rising which by anticipation I alluded to\r\nin the last article, such fresh cruelties were practised by Alexander\r\nII. against the vanquished victims, that every human heart worthy of the\r\nname must shudder at the mere recollection of them.\r\n\r\nFrom those days, however, the Conspiratory Movement in Russia began to\r\nassume larger proportions. What I have said in the preceding pages, goes\r\nfar to explain the violence by which that movement has latterly been\r\ncharacterized.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nPartly from the aggressiveness which is the natural bent of a despotic\r\nmilitary monarchy, partly from the wish to check the home-growth of\r\nLiberal sentiments by frequent blood-letting abroad, the government of\r\nAlexander II. has tried to meet the danger which has been gathering\r\nround the autocratic system by lighting up foreign wars. Central Asia\r\nhas served him for that purpose. So has Turkey. The flag of ambition was\r\nflaunted before public opinion as soon as there was a revival of the\r\nOpposition tendency in internal affairs.\r\n\r\nAn attempt at opening up the whole Eastern Question was made as early as\r\n1870, when France and Germany were locked together in deadly embrace.\r\nThe confidential despatches and cypher telegrams exchanged in 1870\r\nbetween Mr. de Novikoff, the Russian Ambassador at Vienna, and Mr.\r\nIonin, the Russian Consul-General at Ragusa, which fortunately came to\r\nlight some years ago, have fully proved that even then Muscovite policy\r\nbusied itself with getting up a phantom insurrection in Herzegovina,\r\npreparatory to an attack upon Turkey. Nor is it a secret that a\r\nBulgarian Committee of Insurrection, affiliated to Russia, had been in\r\nexistence at Bucharest for years previous to the late war. All these\r\npropagandistic intrigues were in a measure designed to occupy some of\r\nthe more active minds in Russia, who hesitated, between home reform and\r\nPanslavistic ambition.\r\n\r\nThe Czar has indulged in his warlike enterprizes, but he has deceived\r\nhimself in his calculations as regards home policy. All his frightful\r\nspilling of blood abroad has not been able to prevent the formation and\r\nextension of what is called the Nihilist Conspiracy. Side by side with\r\nhis wars, the Secret League has grown apace, overshadowing all his\r\nglory. So extensive have the ramifications of that Conspiracy become\r\nthat the liveliest interest is now awakened as to its origin and its\r\nearliest germs.\r\n\r\nIn the nature of things it is impossible, at present, to speak with full\r\ncertainty on this subject. The Russian revolutionists, being engaged in\r\na desperate struggle, have neither the leisure necessary for writing\r\nsuch statements; nor is it their interest to go into details. Judicial\r\ninquiries have lifted, here and there, some corner of the mysterious\r\nwinding-sheets in which the secret _Vehme_ is enveloped. But more light\r\ncan only be expected after the Conspiracy has been entirely crushed,--in\r\nwhich case, however, owing to the heroic silence which its adherents\r\ngenerally maintain, a great deal of knowledge will for ever be buried in\r\nthe grave,--or the fuller clearing up will come when, as I would fain\r\nhope, this fierce struggle ends with a triumph, whether complete or\r\npartial, of the cause of freedom.\r\n\r\nEven under the iron rule of Nicholas, there were, many years after the\r\nSt. Petersburg insurrection of 1825, still some faint traces of Secret\r\nSocieties, in which the spirit of Pestel and Murawieff was continued.\r\nOne of these occult Leagues was that of Petrascheski, detected in 1849,\r\nwhose members were sentenced to forced labour and to banishment to\r\nSiberia. A nearer approach to the plebeian element than was observable\r\nin the Conspiracies of 1817-25, characterized this later association.\r\nAltogether the more educated classes gradually began to seek closer\r\ncontact with the people at large.\r\n\r\nThis task was in so far facilitated by the tyrannical Czar-Pope\r\nNicholas, in that he not only trod under foot that portion of the\r\nnobiliary class which aimed at a Constitutional share of the political\r\npower, but also persecuted the various dissenting sects in the most\r\nbarbarous fashion.\r\n\r\nUnder an outward gloss of official orthodoxy, Russia is eaten up with a\r\nchaos of sects. The Raskolniks, or Old Believers, profess to be the real\r\nChurch; yet the simplest civic rights were always denied to them.\r\nBesides those Old Believers, numerous other sects exist. They in their\r\nturn are surrounded by a strange fringe of \"Runners,\" \"Jumpers,\"\r\n\"Flagellants,\" \"Self-Mutilators,\" and other eccentric or anti-social\r\npests which crop up most thickly in the dank shadow of an obscurantist\r\ndespotism, whose very roots, however, they gradually destroy and\r\nencroach upon. Persecuted men often seek solace in wild hopes and\r\nprophetic beliefs, which, if strongly nurtured by agitation, are apt to\r\nimperil the persecutor. Under Nicholas, the persecutor of all\r\nDissenters, popular seers occasionally arose, who in their occult\r\nmeetings predicted from the book of Esdra that, after the reign of\r\nNicholas should be over, the Monarchy would fall down under his son and\r\nthat \"the people then would be happy and free.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a state of feeling in the lower and more backward social strata\r\nrendered it at all events easier for would-be reformers of the\r\nconspirator type to enter into closer contact with the plebeian\r\nelement. Though educated men could not have any sympathy with the\r\nmystic views and tone, they found a practical ally in the sullen\r\ndissatisfaction which drove Dissenters to opposition against the\r\nGovernment. So it was under Nicholas. So it still is under Alexander II.\r\nIt may suit the sacerdotal Ritualists, who would fain establish a\r\nconnection of High Church Anglicanism with the official orthodoxy of the\r\nEast, to promote the aggressive policy of the Czar. But English\r\nDissenters, who prize their freedom from clerical trammels, might\r\nremember that Autocracy in Russia represents all that is worst in\r\npolitical as well as in religious fields. Besides upholding the Stuart\r\ndoctrine with the means of a Gengis Khan and a Tamerlane, it pretends,\r\nin Church matters, to a Papal authority, crushing the Bible Christian,\r\nthe eccentric Mystic, and the religious Rationalist, with an equally\r\nheavy hand--and, if need be, as in the case of the Greek Uniates under\r\nAlexander II., with the Cossack knout.\r\n\r\nIn the educated class of Russia, two very different political currents\r\nare observable: the one inclining towards Western Liberalism, whilst the\r\nother cultivates the Nationalist sentiment under rather antiquated\r\nforms. The \"Westerners,\" \"Europeans,\" or \"Liberals,\" are often regarded\r\nby the more stolid adherents of Katkoff as men lacking in patriotism.\r\nBetween these two parties--if we could speak of parties in a country\r\nwhich has no ordered public life--a third group is observable: the\r\nPanslavists, many of whom pursue, under a Liberal mask, aims favourable\r\nto the aggrandizement of Czardom. Not a few of the Panslavists are in\r\nreality mere Government tools. Others, who, like Aksakoff, began as\r\nindependent workers in the Panslavist cause, finally yielded to\r\nGovernment temptation; but after a while even they were found to be too\r\nmuch imbued with reforming ideas, and consequently were placed under\r\npolice surveillance.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of the Russian people has nothing to do with Panslavism;\r\nit does not even know what it is. The idea of a Slav brotherhood is\r\nforeign to it. It can be made, by much priestly preaching, to take a\r\nsort of bigoted interest in alleged co-religionists who are said to be\r\nill-treated by \"unbelieving Turks;\" but the interest and the\r\nunderstanding do not go beyond that. Such is the distinct statement made\r\nlately by one of the best observers, Ivan Turgenieff, the novelist, in a\r\nconversation with a German writer. As to the revolutionary party in\r\nRussia, it has more and more become estranged from the Panslavistic\r\ntendency--so much so that at present it stands in direct opposition to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAlexander Herzen,[49] who favoured the Panslavistic cause, could still\r\nspeak, retrospectively, of Russian Czars as being \"Robespierres on\r\nhorseback\"--an expression of so doubtful a value that it rather reminds\r\nus of the pseudo-revolutionary language of Napoleonism than of the purer\r\nDemocratic principles. Herzen's idea being that Constantinople should\r\nbecome the capital of a great Russo-Slav Empire, we can easily\r\nunderstand that he should have represented Muscovite history under such\r\na deceptive garb. Bakunin also was a Panslavist for a time, but of a\r\ndifferent type, aiming as he did at a loose Democratic Federation of the\r\nvarious Slav tribes. The impossibility of this federation all those will\r\nacknowledge who think it equally chimerical to form a Romanic Federation\r\nbetween nations so dissimilar in origin, history, language, and\r\naspirations, as are the Italians, the French, the Spaniards, the\r\nPortuguese, the French-speaking section of the Swiss, and the Roumans of\r\nMoldo-Wallachia and Hungary. Or would it be less chimerical to try to\r\nform a Teutonic Federation among Germans, Dutch, Danes, Swedes,\r\nNorwegians, Icelanders, German-Swiss, Englishmen, North Americans, and\r\nthe various English colonies?\r\n\r\nNihilism, on its part, has nothing in common with those Panslavist\r\nintrigues which mainly cover an Imperialist ambition. Nihilism, as at\r\npresent known, is, in fact, the very negation of such dangerous\r\nambitious schemes.\r\n\r\nThe first Nihilist Society, properly speaking, is said to have been\r\nfounded by Russian students about the year 1859. German works on\r\nphilosophy and natural science were then much in demand, as forbidden\r\nfruit among the aspiring youths of Russia. The books not being allowed\r\nto pass the frontier, stray copies were smuggled in, and lithographed\r\ntranslations passed from hand to hand. The Agricultural College of\r\nPetrovski, near Moscow, is considered to have been one of the first\r\nplaces where young men became imbued with such advanced ideas. In this\r\nneighbourhood the Netchaieff tragedy was enacted. Among literary men,\r\nTchernitcheffski was one of the first who became a \"Nihilist.\" He\r\nsuffered for it by being banished to Siberia.\r\n\r\nThe word \"Nihilist\" is, however, a somewhat misleading one. It was\r\nconferred at first as a nickname. Afterwards it was adopted (like the\r\nname of the _Gueux_) in a kind of dare-devil mood; and has covered, ever\r\nsince, a great many varieties of political and social discontent, as\r\nwell as of philosophical Radicalism. There are Nihilists who, from the\r\nsheer hopelessness engendered by a tyranny lasting a thousand years,\r\nhave come to cultivate a Philosophy of Despair, of Disgust, and of\r\nDestruction, without troubling themselves as to the constitution of the\r\nFuture. These are men that profess a wish to do away with all State\r\norganizations, for the sake of a morbid Individualism. Others there are\r\nwho, in the semi-revolutionary vein of Comte, incline towards a\r\nsocialist Collectivism in a rather utopian, not to say hierarchic, form.\r\nTo them the word \"Nihilist\" is scarcely applicable.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the word \"Nihilist\" covers, at most, a small group of\r\npersons of a brooding and impracticable temper, such as is sometimes\r\ncreated under the darkest tyrannies. It may be doubted whether the\r\nmajority of those who use the dagger and the revolver without\r\ncompunction against the vile _sbirri_ of an intolerable despotism would\r\ncall themselves Nihilists, or even Socialists. The greater number of the\r\nmembers of the secret leagues are believed to hold views not far removed\r\nfrom those which have found a practical expression in some freely\r\nconstituted countries. The violent means employed are, with many, only\r\nthe outcome of a feeling of revenge easily to be understood under the\r\ncircumstances; or else they are regarded as a dire necessity in\r\ninsurrectionary warfare. True, there have been Russians abroad who spoke\r\nof \"abolishing the Family and Property.\" But nothing warrants the\r\nassumption that this is the principle of the Nihilists in Russia itself.\r\n\r\nIf either mere anarchy, or a system of barrack Communism, be the object\r\nof the majority of the men and women whose deeds have of late riveted\r\nthe attention of all Europe, it is hard to comprehend that these\r\nconspirators should have secured so many friends among classes which by\r\neducation and position cannot possibly have any sympathy with mere\r\ndestructive or utopian schemes. Of the existence of numerous friends of\r\nthe Nihilists in the higher classes there is, however, no doubt. Thus\r\nonly can the hold be explained which the occult propaganda of this _hic\r\net ubique_ conspiracy has obtained upon the commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the participation of women in the present desperate\r\nstruggle. Students, lawyers, officers, Government officials, landed\r\nproprietors, merchants, all kinds of men of the more educated or\r\nwell-to-do classes, have been found to be mixed up with the \"Nihilist\"\r\nConspiracy. By far the most characteristic feature, however, is the\r\nshare which women have taken in the late startling events. When women\r\nthus actively and enthusiastically step forth in a revolutionary or\r\nnational movement, even to the extent of sacrificing their lives, it is\r\nalways a sign of a people's feelings being wrought up to the highest\r\ntension. So great a strain upon the more delicate nature of the fairer\r\nsex cannot be borne very long. It is only at a time of extreme crisis\r\nthat the unusual event occurs; and Russia is now at the very acme of\r\nsuch a crisis.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, in succession, Vjera Sassulitch, a captain's daughter;\r\nSophia Löschern von Herzfeld, a lady of high rank; Nathalie von\r\nArmfeldt, the daughter of an Imperial councillor; Mary Kovalevski, who\r\nalso ranks as a noble; Katharina Sarandovitch, the daughter of a\r\n_tchinovnik_, or official; and several more, of equally prominent\r\nposition, playing in the revolutionary contest a most remarkable part.\r\nThey have suffered imprisonment; they have risked their lives; some of\r\nthem have been condemned to hard labour. One of them was sentenced to\r\nbe shot--but this latter decision even the Czar, though having to wage\r\nwar against women, dared not carry out. This extraordinary mixing of the\r\nfemale sex in a widely ramified conspiracy is of so phenomenal a\r\ncharacter that a sketch of the educational and emancipatory movement\r\nwhich led up to it, may well be here in its place.\r\n\r\nBy way of contrast, let us first look into times which seem to lie ages\r\nbehind us, but which are yet in the recollection of a great many.\r\n\r\nWhen Gogol wrote his \"Dead Souls,\" not quite forty years ago, the\r\neducation of young ladies in Russia was conducted on wonderful\r\nprinciples of \"finishing.\" Young ladies--said Gogol, with cutting\r\nsatire--receive, as is well known, a very good education. Three things\r\nare looked upon, in the establishments to which they are sent, as the\r\npillars of all human virtues: namely, first, a knowledge of the French\r\nlanguage; secondly, the piano; thirdly, domestic economy, which consists\r\nof the embroidery of purses and other objects of surprise. \"Our present\r\ntime,\" he added, \"has shown itself most inventive as regards the\r\nperfection of this educational method; for in one establishment they\r\nbegin with the piano, and then go on to French, concluding with the\r\ndomestic economy alluded to; whereas in another school the embroidering\r\nof purses forms the introduction, upon which French and the piano\r\nfollow. It will be seen that there is much difference in the methods.\"\r\n\r\nGribojedoff also, in a telling comedy, has some striking sarcasms on the\r\nsuperficiality and hollow frivolousness of the education of girls of the\r\nupper classes. \"We bring up our daughters,\" he says, \"as if they were\r\ndestined to be the wives of the dancing-masters and the buffoons to whom\r\nwe entrust their instruction.\" Now and then a reformer started up, but\r\nin a very curious fashion. One of the earliest was Tatjana Passek, the\r\ncousin of Alexander Herzen, of whom a writer, who adopts the signature\r\nof \"Borealis,\" in the Berlin _Gegenwart_, says that in consequence of\r\nthe straitened circumstances of her father, she was compelled to open a\r\nYoung Ladies' Establishment in a provincial town. Intelligent, but\r\nwithout any solid knowledge, she herself relates in her memoirs how she\r\ntaught ancient history off-hand, chiefly by means of a lively\r\nimagination. She even critically expounded the philosophical systems of\r\nGreece and Rome without knowing or understanding them. Her handbook for\r\nGreek History was \"The Travels of Young Anacharsis.\" There was no system\r\nor connection in what she taught, but the sprightliness of her delivery\r\nmade up for the defect. \"When we came to the history of Sparta, we\r\nbecame so enthusiastic for the Lacedæmonian girls that we tried to\r\nimitate their hardened style of life, washing ourselves with cold water,\r\npromenading with bare feet, doing gymnastics, drinking no tea, and\r\nceasing to cry. When I look back upon these performances, I wonder how\r\nmy pupils remained in good health.\" The same lady reports that the\r\nfriends of her youth, disgusted with the hollowness of drawing-room\r\nlife, had endeavoured to satisfy their emancipatory inclinations by\r\ndonning men's dress, indulging in Amazonian tastes, and secretly\r\nfrequenting taverns where, with their aristocratic small hands, they\r\njubilantly raised the foaming cup.\r\n\r\nSo much for girls' education in the higher strata. As to the immense\r\nmass of the Russian population they were left to rot, intellectually, in\r\nutter neglect. The school system in some Western countries--including\r\ncentral and southern Italy before 1859-60, France, and even England\r\nuntil a few years ago--was bad enough. In Russia it was simply\r\nnonexistent. The private educational establishments and grammar schools\r\nin a few towns, which were destined for the more well-to-do middle\r\nclass, were sorry copies of the few Government institutions. I have\r\nbefore mentioned how, under the present reign, a movement for a more\r\nLiberal education arose, which, however, soon led to students' tumults\r\nand to severe police measures. In girls' education, too, a progressive\r\nmovement was initiated. For a short time it was said that the Empress\r\nherself, whose German origin inclined her to that view, would assume its\r\nprotectorate. But soon it was seen that Government mainly busied itself\r\nwith bureaucratic regulations, whilst the foundation of the girls'\r\nschools for which these extensive and often harassing regulations were\r\nframed, proceeded with extreme slowness. In fact, the regulations were\r\nthere; but in most cases the schools were wanting.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the aspiring girlhood of Russia threw itself with avidity\r\nupon the new sources of knowledge, scant as they were, which had at last\r\nbeen opened to it. The Minister of Public Instruction, Golovnin, who was\r\nin office between 1861-66, promoted, in his quality of an opponent of\r\nthe classical method of education, by preference the study of natural\r\nscience. Hence a realistic tendency--often verging upon the harsh and\r\nthe crude--became the prevailing tone. Girls, sick of the idleness and\r\nthe conventional frivolities of social life, eagerly devoted themselves\r\nto scientific pursuits, both as students at the new academies, and as\r\nsubscribers to the courses of lectures which were getting into vogue.\r\nThe very antagonists of the more extreme \"emancipatory\" practices\r\nacknowledge that the greater number of these lady-students, who soon\r\nwere driven to seek for an opportunity of acquiring knowledge at a\r\nforeign university--that is, at Zurich--distinguished themselves by much\r\ndiligence and talent, as well as by a spirit of personal sacrifice in\r\nregard to worldly comforts.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it must be averred that some of them, yielding to an\r\nexaltation and eccentricity easily aroused in womankind, mentally\r\noverbalanced themselves as it were, and began to assume hideous mannish\r\nand hermaphrodite ways. The close-cropped hair, the unnecessarily\r\nspectacled face, the short tight jacket, the cigar, and the frequenting\r\nof public-houses were unpleasant outward signs; but far more deplorable\r\nwas the cynic tone. These were and are the sad excrescences of an\r\notherwise laudable aspiration; but it may be hoped that in course of\r\ntime the excrescences will disappear. The sooner the better, else the\r\nbest friends of the progressive tendency among womankind will turn away\r\nfrom it in sorrow and anger at the unsexing of the sex, whose tenderer\r\nnature--in Schiller's words, let us hope not quite antiquated--is\r\ndestined to \"weave wreaths of heavenly roses into the earthly life.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, all the odd eccentricities, all the sad contempt of the natural\r\nand recognised forms of beauty, delicacy, or even decency, into which\r\nsome may have allowed themselves to be betrayed by their eagerness to\r\nthrow off intolerable intellectual fetters, must not render us unjust to\r\nthe sounder aspect of the movement. Nor can those vagaries prevent us\r\nfrom giving a due meed of admiring praise to the heroism displayed by\r\nthose nobly aspiring women, with whom the exaggerated manner is more an\r\noutward form, whilst their self-sacrificing deeds in the cause of the\r\nfreedom of the nation and the welfare of the neglected masses, show the\r\ntrue humanity and nobility of their heart. \"Dead souls\" they are not.\r\nThe fire of enthusiasm is within them.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nAfter this rapid general survey of the condition of mind of the more\r\nadvanced women in Russia I come to the tragic story of Vjera Sassulitch.\r\nIt is a story typical of the base cruelty of autocratic government;\r\ntypical also of the results such a system must needs produce.\r\n\r\nThe victim and heroine of that ever-memorable tragedy was not, at first,\r\na member of any secret organization. Far from it. At the age of\r\nseventeen, Vjera, then a mere school-girl, had made the acquaintance of\r\nanother school-girl, whose brother was a student. In the course of this\r\ninnocent girlish friendship she was induced to take care of a few\r\nletters destined for the student, Netchaieff, who afterwards played a\r\npart in the revolutionary movement. A \"Nihilist\" Miss Sassulitch, at\r\nthat time, certainly was not. Her whole ambition centred in the wish of\r\npassing her examination to qualify herself for a governess, which she\r\ndid \"with distinction.\"\r\n\r\nNetchaieff's democratic connections having been denounced by a traitor,\r\nwhom he thereupon slew, the school-girl of seventeen, who had known his\r\nsister, and him through her, was thrown into prison as one \"suspected\"\r\nof conspiracy. There was not a shadow of proof against her. No\r\naccusation was even formulated against her. Nevertheless she was kept,\r\n_for two long years_, in the Czar's Bastille--an eternity of torture for\r\na captive uncertain of her fate. These were the words which her counsel,\r\nMr. Alexandroff, addressed to the jury, when, later on, she was tried\r\nfor an attempt upon Trepoff, one of the most hated tools of despotic\r\nprofligacy:--\r\n\r\n     \"The time between the eighteenth and the twentieth year--these are\r\n     the years of youth when childhood ceases; when impressions lasting\r\n     for life are most powerful; when life itself appears yet spotless\r\n     and pure. For the maiden it is the most beautiful time--the time of\r\n     budding love--the time when the girl rises to the fuller\r\n     consciousness of womanhood--the time of fanciful reverie and\r\n     enthusiasm--the time to which, in later days, as a mother and a\r\n     matron, her thoughts will yet fondly turn. Gentlemen of the jury!\r\n     you know in the company of what friends Vjera Sassulitch had to\r\n     pass her best years. The walls of a casemate were her companions.\r\n     For two years she saw neither mother, nor relations, nor friends.\r\n     Sometimes she heard that her mother had come and had given a\r\n     message of greeting. That was all she was allowed to learn. Locked\r\n     up without occupation within the walls of a prison!... Everything\r\n     human concentrated in the single person of the turnkey who brings\r\n     the food!... The monotonousness only broken, now and then, by the\r\n     call of the sentinel, who, peering through the window bars,\r\n     asks,--'Prisoner, have you not done any harm to yourself?' or by\r\n     the rattling of the locks and door-bolts, the clack of guns\r\n     shouldered or grounded, or the dreary striking of the hour in the\r\n     fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul.... Far, far away from\r\n     everything human!... Nothing there to nourish the feelings of\r\n     friendship and love; nothing but the sympathy created by the\r\n     knowledge that, to the right and to the left, there are\r\n     fellow-sufferers passing their wretched days in the same way....\r\n     Thus it was that, in the depth of her solitude, there arose, in\r\n     Vjera Sassulitch, such warm-hearted sympathy for every State\r\n     prisoner that every political convict sufferer became for her a\r\n     spiritual comrade in her recollections, to whom she assigned a\r\n     place in the experience and the impressions of her past life.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the two years that Vjera was kept in dungeons under a mere\r\nsuspicion, she was twice only subjected to a secret inquiry--\"judicial,\"\r\nif that is a word applicable to these dread Inquisition procedures. At\r\nlast she feared she was forgotten. Nothing whatever having come out\r\nagainst her, she was finally set free, and went back to her heart-broken\r\nmother, only to be suddenly re-arrested ten days afterwards! For a\r\nmoment, in spite of a two years' bitter experience, she childishly\r\nthought there was some mistake. But the horrible truth of her situation\r\nsoon broke upon her. One morning she was seized in prison, and, without\r\nbeing allowed to take even a change of dress, or a mantle, transported\r\nby gendarmes to a distant province by way of banishment. One of these\r\ngendarmes threw his own fur over her shivering shoulders, or else she\r\nmight have perished on the road.\r\n\r\nI will not go here through the whole \"infernal circle\" of her sufferings\r\nand involuntary migrations, which I have elsewhere described more fully.\r\nI will not relate how she was \"moved on\" from one place to the other;\r\nthe only variety in her treatment consisting of an occasional return to\r\nprison. Eleven years had thus altogether elapsed when at last, in those\r\nvast dominions of the Czar, and amidst more thrilling events which began\r\nto crowd upon public attention, she seemed to be really forgotten. In\r\nthis way she managed clandestinely to go back to the capital, whence\r\nagain she started for Pensa. It was there that, by chance, she learnt\r\nfrom the _Novoje Vremja_ (\"New Times,\") the infamous treatment of\r\nBogoljuboff, a political prisoner, by the chief of the police at St.\r\nPetersburg, the vile and universally despised Trepoff, the personal,\r\nintimate, and pampered darling of Alexander II.\r\n\r\nThe flogging practices of this tyrannic head of the \"Third Section\" are\r\nstill in every one's recollection. In referring to the knouting applied\r\nto Bogoljuboff, Vjera Sassulitch's counsel gave the following\r\ndescription:--\r\n\r\n     \"The sufferer whose human dignity is to be insulted, knows not why\r\n     he is to be punished. He thinks indignation will lend him strength\r\n     to resist those who throw themselves upon him. But he is grasped by\r\n     the iron grip of jailers' hands; he is dragged down; and in the\r\n     midst of the regular counting of the strokes by the leader of the\r\n     execution, a deep groan is heard--a groan not arising from mere\r\n     physical pain, but from the soul's grief of a down-trodden,\r\n     outraged man. At last, silence reigned again. The sacred act was\r\n     accomplished!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the brooding over such disgrace and affront to which a political\r\nprisoner had been subjected in the very capital by an official whose\r\ndepartment is under the Czar's direct control that pressed the weapon of\r\nrevenge into the hands of a tender woman--not so much for her own past\r\nmiseries as for those of a still suffering fellow-man.\r\n\r\nTrepoff had been attacked by Vjera Sassulitch in his own Cabinet, in the\r\nvery midst of his minions. The jury which tried her was composed almost\r\nexclusively of Aulic Councillors and such-like titled dignitaries.\r\nPrince Gortschakoff sat among the audience; so did the pick and flower\r\nof the upper classes of St. Petersburg. Who could doubt, in presence of\r\nthe open avowal of the accused, that the verdict would be \"Guilty?\"\r\n\r\nStrange to say, even among the officially faultless remarks of the\r\nPublic Prosecutor there were some curious admissions. \"I, for my part,\"\r\nMr. Kessel said, \"fully believe the statements made by Vjera Sassulitch.\r\nI believe that facts appeared to her in the light in which they have\r\nbeen placed here; and _I am ready to accept the feelings of Vjera\r\nSassulitch as facts_. The Court, however, is bound to measure these\r\nfeelings, as soon as they are converted into deeds, by the standard of\r\nthe law.\" Through the summing up of the Judge there ran a strong vein of\r\ninterpretations favourable to the accused. \"An accused person,\" he\r\nremarked, \"could certainly not be looked upon as an infallible\r\ncommentator on the event with which he or she was connected. At the same\r\ntime it had to be noted that criminals were to be divided into two\r\ngroups: those who are led by selfish impulses, and who therefore, in the\r\nmajority of cases, try to mask the truth by lying statements; and those\r\nwho commit an act from no motive of personal profit, and who entertain\r\nno wish to hide anything of the deed they have done. You, gentlemen of\r\nthe jury, are in a position to judge how far the statements of Vjera\r\nSassulitch merit your confidence, and to which type of transgressors she\r\nmost nearly comes up.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a clear hint to any intelligent jury; and the jury of Aulic\r\nCouncillors were intelligent men. Going over all the details of the\r\ncase, the Judge made a great many more remarks in the same spirit. The\r\naudience, who had frequently cheered the eloquence of counsel to such an\r\nextent that the President of the Tribunal had to warn them, were on the\r\ntip-toe of expectation. When the Foreman brought in the verdict: \"No;\r\nshe is _not_ guilty!\" the Hall of Justice--for justice had for once been\r\ndone--rang with enthusiastic applause. Vjera Sassulitch was borne away\r\nin triumph.\r\n\r\nIn the streets, however,--and here we come once more upon all the dark\r\nand terrible ways of Autocracy,--there ensued a fearful scene. An attack\r\nwas made upon the coach in which Vjera Sassulitch was to be carried\r\nhome--apparently with the object of getting her once more into police\r\nclutches. There was a clash of swords and a confused tumult. Gensdarmes\r\nand police broke in upon the mass of people, who wished to protect her.\r\nShots were fired. A nobleman and relation of Vjera, Grigori Sidorazki,\r\nlay dead in the street. A lady also, Miss Anna Rafailnowna, a medical\r\nstudent, writhed on the ground, wounded. The victim of so much prolonged\r\npersecution had herself mysteriously disappeared. Afterwards, an order\r\nfor her re-arrest, marked \"No. 16,\" and dated from the Secret Department\r\nof the Town, came to light--evidently through information given by an\r\naffiliate of the Revolutionary Committee within the police\r\nadministration itself. This occult connection of sundry officials with\r\nthe leaders of the Democratic or Nihilist Conspiracy explains why\r\nGovernment should so often have been hampered in its efforts to suppress\r\nthat organization.\r\n\r\nThe verdict of \"not guilty,\" in the case of Vjera Sassulitch, has been\r\nfollowed by several similar ones--a strong proof of the sympathy felt\r\namong the town populations, at least, with the aims of the\r\nrevolutionists. Franz von Holtzendorff, a well-known legal authority in\r\nGermany, wrote on the case above detailed:--\"Far more significant than\r\nthe verdict of the jury is the fact that that verdict, in spite of its\r\ncontrast to the existing law, has received the approval, as it appears,\r\nof the whole Russian press, of the whole of the upper classes, and even\r\nof the circles of Russian legists. I have had personal occasion to\r\nconvince myself that prominent officials of the Russian Empire gave\r\ntheir applause to that verdict.\" Again, Dr. Holtzendorff said:--\r\n\r\n     \"In Russia, the feelings of right and justice, which are\r\n     systematically and artificially kept down and repressed, and which\r\n     have no outlet in public life, concentrate themselves with their\r\n     full weight in the verdict of a jury. That which the press had no\r\n     liberty of saying during long years, is given vent to in the\r\n     debates of a Court of Justice. An accusation is raised on account\r\n     of a deed which, though punishable as a crime in itself, has been\r\n     produced and nurtured by a system of administrative arbitrariness\r\n     and gross ill-treatment that stands morally deep below the deed in\r\n     question--a system of corruption which cannot be attacked legally,\r\n     nay, which enjoys all the honours the State can award. And who can\r\n     help it if an injustice committed day after day, in the name of the\r\n     State, without any expiation, weighs more heavily upon the public\r\n     conscience than the act of a single person who, boldly risking his\r\n     or her own life, rises with a feeling of the deepest indignation\r\n     against so rotten a system of Government? It is but too natural,\r\n     this wrathful utterance of the popular voice, when it declares that\r\n     a high official, who, trusting in the practical approval of the\r\n     Imperial favour, ordains corporal punishment according to his\r\n     arbitrary caprice against defenceless prisoners, is guilty of a\r\n     greater offence than he who feels driven, by a passionate notion of\r\n     justice, to constitute himself, of his own free will, an avenger of\r\n     the public conscience.... If, in a State afflicted with political\r\n     sickness, the institution of the jury had fallen so deep as to work\r\n     with the mechanical certainty of a military court, and to heed\r\n     nothing but the points of view of jurisprudence, without being\r\n     touched by the current of moral aspirations, thus merely\r\n     registering, with Byzantine obedience, the paragraphs of a code of\r\n     law: such a phenomenon--keeping, as it would, the Government in a\r\n     dangerous error as regards public life--would be far more\r\n     reprehensible than that verdict of 'not guilty' by which a whole\r\n     system of Government was practically condemned.\"\r\n\r\nThe Russian Government system Herr von Holtzendorff, who personally\r\nbelongs to a very moderate political party, brands as \"a system of\r\narbitrary police ordinances, and of the virtual sovereignty of the\r\nAdjutants-General of the Czar--a system of administrative deportations,\r\nof despotic arrestations, of press-gagging--a swashbuckler's\r\ngovernment.\" Another German writer of some distinction, Dr. Henry\r\nJaques, observes--\r\n\r\n     \"Where an absolutist monarch rules in arbitrary manner, without any\r\n     limits to his power, the jury becomes the only representative organ\r\n     of a people utterly bereft of all political rights. In such a case,\r\n     a jury is indeed entitled to speak, before all, the language of the\r\n     people, the language of its aspirations towards freedom, which must\r\n     be heard before everything else, if the nation is to acquire its\r\n     true rights. Even as, in the Iliad, the orphaned Andromache says to\r\n     the parting Hector: 'Thou art now father, brother, and dear mother\r\n     to me!' so the Russian people may say to its jury: 'You are now\r\n     legislators, judges, and the source of mercy at one and the same\r\n     time to me! In you there reposes the One and All of my political\r\n     hopes, of my political rights!\"\r\n\r\nNoble words, but vain hope! First of all, it is not correct to say that\r\nVjera Sassulitch had been judged by a jury under a political charge. For\r\npolitical crimes, or accusations, no jury has ever existed under\r\nAlexander II. Vjera Sassulitch was charged with what Government chose to\r\nconsider a _common_ crime; hence only she was brought before a jury. For\r\npolitical offenders, or what Government chooses to regard as political\r\noffenders, packed tribunals have always been assigned. Happily,\r\nGovernment overreached itself in the case of Vjera Sassulitch, feeling\r\ntoo secure in the loyalty of its own Aulic Councillors.\r\n\r\nSecondly, no sooner had the trial resulted in a verdict of \"not guilty,\"\r\nthan Count Pahlen, the Minister of Justice, who thought the jury were,\r\nof course, quite a safe one, was dismissed. Thirdly, an ukase went\r\nforth, withdrawing from the cognizance of juries even cases of \"common\r\ncrime,\" when such crime was directed against one of the Czar's\r\nofficials. Fourthly, fresh regulations were framed for a change of the\r\njury system, as well as for the discipline of lawyers acting for the\r\ndefence. Fifthly, in the teeth of the verdict given in favour of Vjera\r\nSassulitch, a fresh trial was ordered, to be held in a country town, at\r\nNovgorod, as soon as she could be recaptured. Finally, Alexander the\r\nLiberal, seeing that all ordinary procedures were of no avail,\r\ninstituted a state of siege and drum-head law for political offenders\r\nover a large portion of his Empire.\r\n\r\nThese are the desperate doings of a despotism maddened by an ever-active\r\nhost of enemies. It is usually the beginning of the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nIf any more proofs were wanted of the \"benevolent\" character of the\r\nGovernment of Alexander II., they might be found in the increase, year\r\nby year, of the deportations to Siberia. They are reckoned to be now\r\nfour or five times more numerous than under the galling system of\r\nNicholas. Political banishments have enormously augmented under his\r\nsuccessor. So has the number of the prescribed loose and vagabond class\r\nof ordinary criminals, or suspects, who are frequently whisked off to\r\nSiberia--for the sake of clearing \"Society,\" as it is called--when the\r\ncriminals often become mixed up with the political exiles in an\r\nindistinguishable mass. This is the very refinement of torture, applied\r\nby the agents of a brutal despotism against men generously striving for\r\na reform of the State and of society.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrary deportations are decreed by the \"Third Section,\" or Secret\r\nPolice, which is under the Emperor's personal direction. Formerly, this\r\ndreaded office had the power of administering corporal punishment, in\r\nsecret, to persons of the upper classes, male or female. At the\r\nSassulitch trial, the counsel for the defence made a dark allusion to\r\nthis practice, which created a deep impression in Court. It was a\r\nreference to a whipping-machine once in use, and of which some of those\r\npresent--ladies, as well as gentlemen--may have had personal experience.\r\nA correspondent has given the following description:--The suspected\r\nperson, who could not be brought to trial, but whom it was intended to\r\ncastigate, would be invited to call at the Office of the Secret Police.\r\nAfter a few moments' conversation with the dread functionary, the floor\r\nwould suddenly sink beneath the visitor's feet, and he would find\r\nhimself suspended by the waist, all that part of the body below it being\r\nunder the floor, and concealed from view. Then invisible hands and\r\nequally invisible rods would rapidly perform their duty--the trap-door\r\nwould rise again--and the visitor would be bowed out with great\r\ncourtesy, and go home, carrying with him substantial marks to remind him\r\nof his interview.\r\n\r\nThough this more than Oriental custom has been abolished, enough remains\r\nof barbarity to explain why successive chiefs of the hated police\r\nHermandad--Trepoff, Mesentzoff, and Drentelen--should have been the mark\r\nof the bullet of popular revenge. A Russian writer says:--\r\n\r\n     \"A history of the secret doings, of all the horrors and crimes\r\n     perpetrated by this disgraceful institution, would fill up many\r\n     volumes, before the contents of which the most sensational novels\r\n     would appear tame and shallow. There is scarcely any sphere of\r\n     public or private life which is exempted from the irresponsible\r\n     control of this Inquisition of the nineteenth century. The verdict\r\n     of a Court has no value whatever for the Third Section. Not only\r\n     acquitted political offenders are as a rule transported,\r\n     administratively, to some distant town of the Empire, but even the\r\n     judges themselves, when they are considered to have passed too\r\n     lenient a verdict, are liable to be forced into resigning their\r\n     office, and to be then _exiled in company with the very prisoners\r\n     who had stood before them_!\"\r\n\r\nLest this description should appear to be overdrawn, I may quote from\r\nthe letter of the St. Petersburg correspondent of an English journal,\r\nwhich is certainly not unfavourable to the Government of Alexander II.\r\nThe letter was written after the recent proclamation of a state of\r\nsiege. And the writer says:--\r\n\r\n     \"As proofs and instances, not so much of martial law as of the\r\n     repressive measures adopted (in many cases by ordinary\r\n     administrative agency, without the machinery of martial law), I may\r\n     mention that at the present time, as I am well informed, _more than\r\n     600 persons of the privileged classes are under arrest, to be\r\n     deported to Siberia without trial_. In one of the temporary\r\n     governor-generalships in the south of the Empire (Odessa), sixty\r\n     privileged persons have been already sent to Siberia without trial,\r\n     and 200 persons of this class are under arrest to be judged. So\r\n     great is the number of persons of this category to be escorted that\r\n     a practical difficulty is said to have arisen in connection with\r\n     their deportation. A noble, or privileged person, who has not been\r\n     judicially sentenced, when sent to Siberia by 'administrative\r\n     process' (as it is called, _i.e._, by the orders of the Third\r\n     Section, or Secret Police), must be escorted by two gensdarmes, it\r\n     being against the laws to manacle a privileged person who is\r\n     uncondemned. It appears that there are not gensdarmes enough thus\r\n     to escort the number of persons to be deported, and the Ministry of\r\n     Secret Police has, I understand, proposed to get rid of this\r\n     difficulty by sending the privileged persons fettered like ordinary\r\n     criminals.... The Third Section, or Secret Police, which is in its\r\n     proceedings essentially _extra leges_, claims to act independently\r\n     of any other department of the Empire. This institution, which lays\r\n     hold of suspected persons, whether justly or unjustly suspected,\r\n     and consigns them to Siberia at its pleasure, savours more of\r\n     Asiatic lawlessness than of enlightened European rule, such as it\r\n     must be the desire of all in authority to see established\r\n     throughout the Empire.... I have myself met with respectable,\r\n     honourable men, who have been arrested and imprisoned, in some\r\n     cases for a few weeks, in other cases during months, _followed by\r\n     years of exile in Siberia, without any charge being brought against\r\n     them_; and it is the possibility of this recurring to them, or to\r\n     others, that constitutes a Reign of Terror.\"\r\n\r\nThe above description is from the correspondent of the _Daily News_.\r\nClearly it is a very pleasant position to be a \"privileged person\" in\r\nRussia. It marks its occupant, by preference, as a possible candidate\r\nfor exile to Siberia; the more cultivated classes being essentially\r\nthose which constitute the active element of political dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nOf the treatment of political exiles in Siberia, as it has been carried\r\non for a long time past, I have before me a thrilling description from\r\nthe pen of Mr. Robert Lemke, a German writer, who has visited the\r\nvarious penal establishments of Russia, with an official legitimation.\r\nHe had been to Tobolsk; after which he had to make a long, dreary\r\njourney in a wretched car, until a high mountain arose before him. In\r\nits torn and craggy flank the mountain showed a colossal opening similar\r\nto the mouth of a burnt-out crater. Fetid vapours, which almost took\r\naway his breath, ascended from it.\r\n\r\nPressing the handkerchief upon his lips, Mr. Lemke entered the opening\r\nof the rock, when he found a large watch-house, with a picket of\r\nCossacks. Having shown his papers of legitimation, he was conducted by a\r\nguide through a long, very dark, and narrow corridor, which, judging\r\nfrom its sloping descent, led down into some unknown depth. In spite of\r\nhis good fur, the visitor felt extremely cold. After a walk of some ten\r\nminutes through the dense obscurity, the ground becoming more and more\r\nsoft, a vague shimmer of light became observable. \"We are in the mine!\"\r\nsaid the guide, pointing with a significant gesture to the high iron\r\ncross-bars which closed the cavern before them.\r\n\r\nThe massive bars were covered with a thick rust. A watchman appeared,\r\nwho unlocked the heavy iron gate. Entering a room of considerable\r\nextent, but which was scarcely a man's height, and which was dimly lit\r\nby an oil-lamp, the visitor asked, \"Where are we?\" \"In the sleeping-room\r\nof the condemned! Formerly it was a productive gallery of the mine; now\r\nit serves as a shelter.\"\r\n\r\nThe visitor shuddered. This subterranean sepulchre, lit by neither sun,\r\nnor moon, was called a sleeping-room. Alcove-like cells were hewn into\r\nthe rock; here, on a couch of damp, half-rotten straw, covered with a\r\nsackcloth, the unfortunate sufferers were to repose from the day's work.\r\nOver each cell a cramp-iron was fixed, wherewith to lock-up the\r\nprisoners like ferocious dogs. No door, no window anywhere.\r\n\r\nConducted through another passage, where a few lanterns were placed, and\r\nwhose end was also barred by an iron gate, Mr. Lemke came to a large\r\nvault, partly lit. This was the mine. A deafening noise of pickaxes and\r\nhammers. There he saw some hundreds of wretched figures, with shaggy\r\nbeards, sickly faces, reddened eyelids; clad in tatters, some of them\r\nbarefoot, others in sandals, fettered with heavy foot-chains. No song,\r\nno whistling. Now and then they shyly looked at the visitor and his\r\ncompanion. The water dripped from the stones; the tatters of the\r\nconvicts were thoroughly wet. One of them, a tall man, of suffering\r\nmien, laboured hard with gasping breath, but the strokes of his pickaxe\r\nwere not heavy and firm enough to loosen the rock.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you here?\" Mr. Lemke asked.\r\n\r\nThe convict looked confused, with an air almost of consternation, and\r\nsilently continued his work.\r\n\r\n\"It is forbidden to the prisoners,\" said the inspector, \"to speak of the\r\ncause of their banishment!\"\r\n\r\nEntombed alive; forbidden to say why!\r\n\r\n\"But who is the convict?\" Mr. Lemke asked the guide, with low voice.\r\n\r\n\"It is Number 114!\" the guide replied, laconically.\r\n\r\n\"This I see,\" answered the visitor; \"but what are the man's antecedents?\r\nTo what family does he belong?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a count,\" replied the guide; \"a well-known conspirator. More, I\r\nregret to say, I cannot tell you about Number 114!\"\r\n\r\nThe visitor felt as if he were stifled in the grave-like atmosphere--as\r\nif his chest were pressed in by a demoniacal nightmare. He hastily asked\r\nhis guide to return with him to the upper world. Meeting there the\r\ncommander of the military establishment, he was obligingly asked by that\r\nofficer--\r\n\r\n\"Well, what impression did our penal establishment make upon you?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lemke stiffly bowing in silence, the officer seemed to take this as\r\na kind of satisfied assent, and went on--\r\n\r\n\"Very industrious people, the men below; are they not?\"\r\n\r\n\"But with what feelings,\" Mr. Lemke answered, \"must these unfortunates\r\nlook forward to the day of rest after the week's toil!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rest!\" said the officer; \"convicts must always labour. There is no rest\r\nfor them. They are condemned to perpetual forced labour; and he who once\r\nenters the mine never leaves it!\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is barbarous!\"\r\n\r\nThe officer shrugged his shoulders, and said, \"The exiled work daily for\r\ntwelve hours; on Sundays too. They must never pause. But, no; I am\r\nmistaken. Twice a year, though, rest is permitted to them--at\r\nEaster-time, and on the birthday of His Majesty the Emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nCan we wonder, when we see the ultra-Bulgarian atrocities practised in\r\nRussia, that \"Terror for Terror!\" should at last have become the parole\r\nof the men of the Revolutionary Committee?\r\n\r\nI will not go over the harrowing details of the events of the last seven\r\nor eight months; they are still fresh in every one's remembrance. The\r\nonly measures that could stay this destructive contest are\r\nsystematically withheld by the Czar, who will not permit the slightest\r\ndisplay of popular sentiments within the lawful domain of Representative\r\nGovernment. Many years ago a distinguished French writer described the\r\nRussian system as \"a tyranny tempered by the dagger.\" Alexander, too,\r\nhimself is fully aware of this tragic concatenation of events. He is\r\neven known to have often, in the very beginning of his reign, expressed\r\na feeling of fear lest his own end should be a violent one, like that of\r\nso many of his predecessors. The attempts of Karakasoff and Berezowski\r\nhave lately been repeated by Solovieff. Whilst strongly condemning the\r\ndeed of the latter, even the Conservative _Standard_ felt called upon,\r\nby the dangers of the situation at large, to make the following\r\ncomments, which possess a lasting interest:--\r\n\r\n     \"It would be well if this painful incident could be disposed of by\r\n     a homily upon individual wickedness and individual perverseness.\r\n     Unhappily, it is but too certain that not only the deed itself, but\r\n     the peculiar circumstances attending it, are closely related with\r\n     the existing condition of a considerable section of Russian\r\n     society. We are obliged to add that this condition is closely\r\n     connected, in turn, with the form of government and the methods of\r\n     administration that prevail in that country.... In spite of the\r\n     emancipation of the serfs from the condition of territorial\r\n     slavery, the Russian people have made little visible progress in\r\n     the acquisition of political freedom. The Czar is still an absolute\r\n     Sovereign; his Ministers still remain responsible to no will but\r\n     his, and their agents have to answer only to their superiors for\r\n     the manner in which they exercise authority.... The sanguine youth\r\n     of the nation, eager for a career, and burning for activity, finds\r\n     itself debarred from any course of distinction save that of arms,\r\n     or that official existence which too often places men in Russia in\r\n     antagonism to their own countrymen.... The old method of\r\n     government--of police supervision, of private espionage, of\r\n     imprisonment, of exile, of political silence--has been tried, and\r\n     the result is discontent and extensive conspiracy. We fear that\r\n     even the confession of sensualistic atheism by Solovieff will not\r\n     prevent his memory from being cherished by thousands of his\r\n     countrymen. They will forget everything, save his desire to endow\r\n     them with more freedom. Whatever his faults, they will consider\r\n     that he perished in their cause, and _what they will be most\r\n     disposed to blame will be the unsteadiness of his hand and the\r\n     uncertainty of his aim_.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ also, whilst pleading for Solovieff's execution,\r\nacknowledged the fact of the sway of Czardom being rotten to the core,\r\nin the following words:--\"It cannot be disputed that whole classes in\r\nRussia are penetrated almost to desperation with a sense of social\r\noppression and wrong.... A social condition like this is the natural\r\nsoil in which the brooding temperament which seeks a remedy in\r\nassassination is nourished.\"\r\n\r\nWhen all the safety-valves are closed, Nature takes its revenge, and\r\never and anon occasions the inevitable outburst. Russia is at present\r\nunder a state of siege from St. Petersburg to Moscow and Warsaw, from\r\nKieff to Kharkoff and Odessa. An Army of Porters, about 15,000 strong,\r\nmust watch the streets of the capital, day and night; and policemen are\r\nset to watch the watchers. Under General Gurko, the crosser of the\r\nBalkans, who is now Vice-Emperor, the last lines of legality have also\r\nbeen crossed--if the word \"legality\" applies at all to Russian\r\ninstitutions. He is invested with unlimited powers, in the place of the\r\ndisheartened tyrant. The very Grand Dukes are under his orders. Arrests\r\namong officers of the army have been the immediate consequence of\r\nGeneral Gurko's satrap rule. In several cases, compromising letters and\r\nprints were discovered, and executions both of officers, like Lieutenant\r\nDubrovin, and of privates, have followed. The gallows are in permanent\r\nactivity. But perhaps the most significant feature--and a promising one\r\ntoo--is the order issued, under court-martial law, that in all the\r\nbarracks a list of the soldiers' arms is to be drawn up, and to be\r\nhanded over to the police! This is the strongest sign of a suspicion\r\nagainst the army itself; and on the army the whole power of Czardom\r\nreposes.\r\n\r\nWhen we hear of the arrest of a Senator, of a Director of the Imperial\r\nBank, of Professors, of the son of the Chancellor of the dreaded \"Third\r\nSection,\" of the wife of the procurator of a Military Court, of the\r\nnephew of the Chief of the Secret Police, and many other such cases, we\r\nare driven to the conclusion that, in spite of its furious acts of\r\nrepression, the autocratic system has become untenable--that it must\r\nsooner or later fall. Like the Roman Emperor, Alexander II. might be\r\nglad if revolt had but a single neck. But is it possible for him to\r\nimagine that there exists but one party of malcontents? Do not the very\r\narrests just mentioned belie such an assertion?\r\n\r\nConspirators are laid hold of by the Czar's _sbirri_ together with men\r\nwho would not think of armed resistance. Despotism is frightened, in\r\nfact, by the very shadows on the wall. Even the Slavophil and Panslavist\r\nparties--still the ready instruments of aggressive policy--have both\r\nbecome imbued with Constitutional ideas that look like sacrilege in the\r\neyes of the Pope-Czar. The revolutionists of _Land and Liberty_ (\"Zemlja\r\ni Wolja\"); the Socialist Jacobins who follow the doctrines of the\r\n_Tocsin_ (\"Nabat\"); the Nihilists, properly speaking; and the moderate\r\nConstitutionalists, are all alike the enemies of the present form of\r\nGovernment. In some districts the peasantry have risen; and, remarkable\r\nto say, the first troop of Cossacks that was led against the insurgents,\r\nrefused to fight them. These are portents whose gravity cannot be\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nTen years ago, when the Napoleonic Empire still stood erect, I said, in\r\nan article on \"The Condition of France,\" in the _Fortnightly Review_:--\r\n\r\n     \"A mighty change is undoubtedly hovering in the air. There may be\r\n     short and sharp shocks and counter-shocks for a little while; but,\r\n     unless all signs deceive, the great issue cannot be long delayed.\r\n     The calmest observer is unable to deny the significance of the\r\n     electrical flashes occasionally shooting now across the atmosphere.\r\n     It is as if words of doom were traced in lurid streaks, breaking\r\n     here and there through the darkened sky. We are strongly reminded\r\n     of the similar incidents which marked the summer of 1868 in Spain.\r\n     Those incidents were then scarcely understood abroad; yet they\r\n     meant the subsequent great event of September. Even so there are\r\n     now signs and portents in France--only fraught with a meaning for\r\n     Europe at large.\"\r\n\r\nThis was published in December, 1869. In the following year, September,\r\n1870, Bonapartist rule was a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nCzardom, on its part, may play out its last card by embarking upon a\r\nfresh war. It will only thereby hasten its doom. Though in Russia\r\nconcentrated action, for the sake of overthrowing a system of\r\nGovernment, is surrounded with greater difficulties than in France, I\r\nfully expect that the day is not far distant when Autocracy must either\r\nbend by making a concession to the more intelligent popular will, or be\r\nutterly broken and uprooted. \"Terror for Terror!\" is a war-cry of\r\ndespair; but on such a principle a nation's life cannot continue. The\r\nmoment may come when the Tyrant will be driven to bay in his own palace.\r\nAnd loud and hearty will be the shout of freemen when that event\r\noccurs--of the men striving for liberty in the great prison-house of the\r\nMuscovite Empire itself, as well as of all those abroad who have still\r\nsome pity left in their hearts for the woes of a host of down-trodden\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n  KARL BLIND.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[47] Russland unter Alexander II. Leipzig: 1870.\r\n\r\n[48] \"The day and night of the battle passed, and the sufferers received\r\nno food or water, and their festering wounds were undressed. The\r\nfollowing morning the Russians entered and took possession, and made the\r\nday one of rejoicing WITH THE VISIT OF THE CZAR AND THE IMPERIAL STAFF;\r\nbut this celebration of the event, however short it may have seemed to\r\nthe victors, was a long season of horrible suffering for the wretched,\r\nhelpless captives who stretched their skeleton hands in vain towards\r\nheaven, praying for a bit of bread or a drop of water. Neither friend\r\nnor foe was there to alleviate their sufferings, or to give the trifle\r\nneeded to save them from a painful death, and they died by hundreds; and\r\nbefore the morning of the third day the dead crowded the living in every\r\none of those dirty, dimly-lighted rooms which confined the wounded in a\r\nfoul and fetid atmosphere of disease and death. It was only on the\r\nmorning of the third day that these wretched, tortured creatures had\r\nbeen left to their fate, that the Russians began the separation of the\r\nliving from the dead.\"--_Daily News_ Letter from Plevna.\r\n\r\n[49] There is a notion in this country that Herzen, at one time, was\r\nbanished to Siberia, and lived as an exile there. The idea is founded on\r\na book of his, published in German and English, under the title of \"My\r\nExile in Siberia.\" Herzen, however, was never banished to Siberia, but\r\nonly interned for a time at Perm, which is several hundred miles from\r\nthe Siberian frontier, and later at Novgorod. There, as a Government\r\nofficial, he had to sign the passport documents of those who were\r\ntransported to Siberia. He left Russia, and lived abroad in voluntary\r\nexile when he wrote his works of Panslavistic propagandism under\r\nSocialist colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST SIN,\r\n\r\nAS RECORDED IN THE BIBLE AND IN ANCIENT ORIENTAL TRADITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of the Paradisiacal happiness of the earliest human beings\r\nconstitutes one of the most universal of traditions. According to the\r\nEgyptians, the terrestrial reign of the God Ra, by which the existence\r\nof the world and of humanity was inaugurated, was an age of gold, to\r\nwhich Egyptians ever recurred regretfully; so that in order to convey\r\nthe idea of any given thing transcending imagination, they were in the\r\nhabit of affirming that \"nothing had ever been seen like unto it since\r\nthe days of the God Ra.\"\r\n\r\nThis belief in an age of innocence and bliss, by which the career of\r\nhumanity began, is also to be met with amongst all peoples of Aryan or\r\nJaphetic race, and was theirs anterior to their separation, the learned\r\nhaving long agreed that this is one of the points on which Aryan\r\ntraditions are most plainly derivable from one common source with those\r\nof the Semitic race, of which last Genesis affords us the expression.\r\nBut with Aryan nations this belief was closely linked with a conception\r\nspecially their own--that, namely, of four successive ages of the world;\r\nand we find this conception attain to fullest development in India.\r\nCreated things, and among them humanity, are destined to endure for\r\n12,000 divine years, each of which contains 360 years as reckoned by\r\nmen. This enormous period of time is divided into four ages or epochs:\r\nthe age of perfection, or _Kritayuga_; the age of the threefold\r\nsacrifice--that is, the perfect accomplishment of all religious duties,\r\nor _Trêtayuga_; the age of doubt or of the obscuration of religious\r\nnotions, _Dvaparayuga_; finally, the age of perdition, or _Kaliyuga_,\r\nwhich is the present age, only to be brought to a close by the\r\ndestruction of the world.[50] The Works and Days of Hesiod show us that\r\nprecisely the same succession of ages was held by the Greeks, but\r\nwithout their duration being calculated by years, and with the\r\nsupposition of a new humanity being produced at the beginning of each;\r\nthe gradual degeneracy, however, which marks this succession of ages is\r\nexpressed by the metals after which they are named--gold, silver, brass,\r\nand iron. Our present humanity belongs to the age of iron, and is the\r\nworst of all, although it began with the heroes. Zoroastrian Mazdeism\r\nalso admits this theory of the four ages, and we find it expressed in\r\nthe _Bundehesh_,[51] but under a form less nearly akin to the Indian\r\nconception than was Hesiod's, and without the same spirit of crushing\r\nfatalism. Here the duration of the universe is fixed at 12,000 years,\r\ndivided into four periods of 3000. In the first all is pure; the good\r\nGod _Ahuramazda_ reigns over his creation, in which as yet evil has not\r\nappeared; in the second, the evil spirit Angromainyus issues from the\r\ndarkness in which he had up to this time remained inert, and declares\r\nwar against Ahuramazda, and then begins their conflict of 9000 years,\r\nwhich occupies three of the world's ages. During the first 3000 years\r\nAngromainyus has but little power; during the second, the success of the\r\ntwo principles remains pretty evenly balanced; finally, during the last\r\nage, which is that of historic times, evil prevails, but this age is to\r\nterminate with the final defeat of Angromainyus, to be followed by the\r\nresurrection of the dead and the beatitude of the risen just. The advent\r\nof the prophet of Iran, of Zarakhustra (Zoroaster) is placed at the\r\nclose of the third age, or exactly in the middle of that period of 6000\r\nyears which is assigned to the duration of the human race under their\r\nactual conditions.\r\n\r\nCertain learned authorities--as, for instance, Ewald and M. Maury--have\r\nstriven to discover in the general order of Biblical history traces of\r\nthis system of the four ages. But impartial criticism must admit that\r\nthey have not made out their case; the foundations on which they have\r\ntried to establish their demonstration are so entirely artificial, so\r\nopposed to the spirit of the Scripture narrative, that they break down\r\nof themselves.[52] And, indeed, M. Maury is the first to allow that\r\nthere is a fundamental opposition between the Biblical tradition and\r\nthe legend of Brahminical India or of Hesiod. In this last, as he\r\nhimself remarks, we see \"no trace of a predisposition to sin transmitted\r\nby inheritance from the first man to his descendants, no vestige of\r\noriginal sin.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt, as Pascal has so eloquently said, \"it is in this abyss that\r\nthe problem of our condition gathers its complications and intricacies,\r\nso that man is more inconceivable without this mystery than this mystery\r\nis inconceivable to man;\" but the truth of the fall and of original sin\r\nis one of those against which human pride has most constantly rebelled,\r\nis, indeed, the one from which it spontaneously seeks to escape. Hence\r\nof all portions of primeval tradition as to the beginnings of humanity\r\nit has been the earliest obliterated. As soon as men felt the sense of\r\nexultation to which the progress of their civilization and their\r\nconquests in the material world gave birth, they repudiated the idea.\r\nReligious philosophers springing up outside the revelation which was\r\nheld in trust by the chosen people took no account of the Fall; and,\r\nindeed, how could that doctrine have been made to harmonize with the\r\ndreams of Pantheism and emanation? By rejecting the notion of original\r\nsin, and substituting the doctrine of emanation for that of creation,\r\nmost of the peoples of pagan antiquity were led to the melancholy theory\r\nof the four ages, such as we find it in the Sacred Books of India and\r\nthe poetry of Hesiod. It was by the law of decadence and continual\r\ndeterioration that the ancient world believed itself so heavily laden.\r\nIn proportion as time passed and things departed further and further\r\nfrom their point of emanation, they corrupt themselves and grow ever\r\nworse. This is the effect of an inexorable fate and of the very force of\r\ntheir development. In this fatal evolution towards decline, there is no\r\nroom left for human freedom; the whole revolves in a circle from which\r\nthere is no means of escaping. With Hesiod, each age marks a decadence\r\nfrom the one that preceded it; and, as the poet explicitly declares\r\nregarding the iron age inaugurated by heroes, each of these ages taken\r\nseparately follows the same descending scale as does their totality. In\r\nIndia the conception of the four ages or _Yuga_, by developing itself\r\nand producing its natural consequences, engenders that of the\r\n_Manvantara_. According to this new theory the world, after having\r\naccomplished its four ages of constant degeneration, undergoes\r\ndissolution (_pralaya_), things having reached such a pitch of\r\ncorruption as to be no longer capable of subsisting. Then there springs\r\nup a new universe, with a new humanity--doomed to the same cycle of\r\nnecessary and fatal evolution, which the four _Yugas_ in turn go\r\nthrough, till a new dissolution takes place; and so on to infinity. Here\r\nwe have, indeed, fatalism under the most cruelly inexorable form, and\r\nalso the most destructive of all true morality. For there can be no\r\nresponsibility where there is no freedom, nor is there in reality any\r\ngood or evil where corruption is the effect of an irresistible law of\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nHow far more consolatory is the Biblical statement, hard though it first\r\nappear to human pride, and how incomparable the prospects it opens out\r\nto the mind! It admits that man, almost as soon as created, fell from\r\nhis state of original purity and Edenic bliss. In virtue of the law of\r\nheredity everywhere imprinted on Nature, it was the fault committed by\r\nthe first ancestors of humanity in the exercise of their moral freedom\r\nwhich condemned their descendants to punishment, and by bequeathing to\r\nthem an original taint predisposed them to sin. But this predisposition\r\nto sin does not condemn man fatally to its committal; he may escape from\r\nit by the exercise of his free will; and in the same way he may by\r\npersonal effort raise himself gradually out of the state of material\r\ndecline and misery to which the fault of his ancestors has brought him\r\ndown. The pagan conception of the four ages unrolls before us a picture\r\nof constant degeneration, whereas the whole order of Biblical history\r\nfrom its starting-point in the earliest chapters of Genesis affords the\r\nspectacle of the progressive rise of humanity from the period of its\r\noriginal fall. On one hand, its course is conceived of as a continual\r\ndescent; on the other, as a continual ascent. The Old Testament, which\r\nwe must here embrace in one general view, occupies itself but little\r\nindeed with this ever-ascending course as regards the development of\r\nmaterial civilization, of which, however, it cursorily points out the\r\nprincipal stages with a good deal of exactness. It rather traces for us\r\nthe picture of moral progress, and of the more and more definite\r\ndevelopment of religious truth, the apprehension of which goes on ever\r\ngaining in spirituality, purity, and breadth amongst the chosen people,\r\nby a series of steps marked by the calling of Abraham, the promulgation\r\nof the Mosaic Law, and, lastly, by the mission of the prophets, who in\r\ntheir turn announce the last and supreme progress. This is to result\r\nfrom the coming of the Messiah, and the consequences of this last\r\nprovidential fact will go on continually developing themselves, and\r\ntending towards a perfection, the term of which lies in the Infinite.\r\nThis notion of a rise after the fall, the fruit of man's free effort\r\nassisted by divine grace and working within the limit of his powers\r\ntowards the accomplishment of the providential plan, is shown to us by\r\nthe Old Testament as existing only in one people, the people of Israel;\r\nbut the Christian spirit has extended the view to the universal history\r\nof mankind, and thus has arisen that conception of a law of continual\r\nprogress unknown to antiquity, to which our modern society is so\r\ninvincibly attached, but which is, we should never forget, an idea due\r\nto Christianity.\r\n\r\nZoroastrianism was unlike other pagan religions in this, that it could\r\nnot fail to admit and preserve the ancient tradition of a first sin.\r\nRather would it have been forced to construct for itself an analogical\r\nmyth, had it not found such in the primitive memories that it bent to\r\nits own doctrines. The tradition squared, indeed, but too well with its\r\nsystem of a dualism having a spiritual basis, although as yet but\r\nimperfectly freed from confusion between the physical and moral worlds.\r\nIt explained quite naturally how man, a creature of the good God, and\r\nconsequently originally perfect, should have fallen under the power of\r\nthe evil spirit, thus contracting a taint which in the moral order\r\nsubjected him to sin, in the material to death, and to all the miseries\r\nthat poison earthly existence. Thus the notion of the sin of the first\r\nauthors of humanity, the heritage of which weighs constantly on their\r\ndescendants, is a fundamental one in Mazdean books. The modification of\r\nlegends relative to the first man even resulted in the mythic\r\nconceptions of the later periods of Zoroastrianism, in attaching a\r\nrather singular repetition of this first transgression to several\r\nsuccessive generations in the initial ages of humanity.\r\n\r\nOriginally--and this is at present one of the points most solidly\r\nestablished by science--originally in those legends common to Oriental\r\nAryans before their separation into two branches, the first man was the\r\npersonage that the Iranians call Yima, and the Indians Yama. A son of\r\nHeaven and not of man, Yima united the characteristics that Genesis\r\ndivides between Adam and Noah, fathers both, the one of antediluvian,\r\nthe other of postdiluvian humanity. Later, he appears as merely the\r\nfirst king of the Iranians, but a king whose existence, as well as that\r\nof his subjects, is passed in the midst of Edenic beatitude in the\r\nparadise of Airyana-Vædja,[53] the dwelling-place of the earliest men.\r\nBut after a time when life was pure and spotless, Yima committed the sin\r\nwhich weighs on his descendants, and in consequence of that sin, lost\r\nhis power, was cast out of Paradise, and given up to the dominion of the\r\nserpent, the evil spirit Angromainyus,[54] who finally brought about\r\nYima's death by horrible torments.[55] It is an echo of the tradition\r\nabout the loss of Paradise ensuing upon a transgression prompted by the\r\nEvil Spirit that we find in what is incontestably one of the oldest\r\nportions of the Sacred Scriptures of Zoroastrianism.[56] \"I created the\r\nfirst and the best of dwelling-places. I who am Ahuramazda: the\r\nAiryana-Vædja is of excellent nature. But against it Angromainyus, the\r\nmurderer, created a thing inimical, the serpent out of the river and the\r\nwinter, the work of the Doevas.\"[57] And it is this scourge, caused by\r\nthe power of the serpent, which occasions the departure for ever from\r\nthe paradisiacal region.\r\n\r\nLater, Yima appears as no longer the first man, or even the first king.\r\nThe period of a thousand years assigned to his existence in Eden[58] is\r\nnow divided between several successive generations, occupying the same\r\nspace of time, from the moment when Gayomaritan, the type of humanity,\r\nbegan to find himself struggling against the hostility of the Evil\r\nSpirit up to the death of Yima. This is the system adopted by the\r\nBundehesh. The history of the sin which made Yima lose his primal\r\nhappiness, and subjected him to the power of the adversary, still\r\nremains connected with the name of that hero. But this transgression is\r\nno longer the original sin; and in order to be able to attribute it to\r\nthe ancestors whence all humanity springs, its story is again told here\r\n(subserving a double purpose) in connection with the first pair whose\r\nexistence was completely terrestrial and similar to that of other human\r\nbeings--Masha and Mashyâna. \"Man was; the father of the world was.\r\nHeaven was destined to be his on condition of his being humble in heart,\r\nand doing with humility the work of the law, of his being pure in\r\nthought, pure in word, pure in deed, and of his never invoking the\r\nDoevas. Under these conditions man and woman were reciprocally to make\r\neach other's happiness. They drew near and became man and wife. At first\r\nthey spoke these words: 'It is Ahuramazda who has given the water, the\r\nearth, the trees, the beasts, and the stars, the moon and the sun, and\r\nall the blessings which spring from a pure root and pure fruit.' Later,\r\nfalsehood ran through their thoughts, perverted their disposition, and\r\nsaid to them: 'It is Angromainyus who has given the water, earth, trees,\r\nbeasts, and all above-named things.' Thus, it was that in the beginning\r\nAngromainyus deceived them concerning the Doevas, and to the end this\r\ncruel one has only sought to seduce them. By believing this lie, both\r\nbecame like unto demons, and their souls will be in Hell until the\r\nrenewal of bodies.\"\r\n\r\n\"They ate during thirty days; they clothed themselves in black raiment.\r\nAfter these thirty days they went hunting; a white goat presented\r\nitself; with their mouths they drew milk from her udder, and nourished\r\nthemselves with that milk which delighted them....\r\n\r\n\"The Doeva who told the lie, grew more bold, and presented himself a\r\nsecond time, _and brought them fruits which they ate, and by so doing of\r\nthe hundred advantages they enjoyed there remained to them only one_.\r\n\r\n\"After thirty days and thirty nights a fat white sheep appeared; they\r\ncut off his left ear. Instructed by the celestial Yazata[59] they\r\nbrought fire from the tree Konar, by rubbing it with a piece of wood.\r\nBoth set fire to the tree; they blew up the fire with their mouths; they\r\nfirst burnt the branches of the tree Konar, next of the date-tree, and\r\nthe myrtle.... They roasted the sheep, dividing it into three parts.[60]\r\n... Having eaten of the flesh of the dog they covered themselves with\r\nthe skin of that animal. Then they gave themselves up to the chase and\r\nmade themselves garments of the hair of wild beasts.\"[61]\r\n\r\nWe may here observe that in Genesis also, vegetable food is the only one\r\nmade use of by the first man in his state of bliss and purity; the only\r\none promised him by God. Animal food does not become lawful till after\r\nthe Flood. It is also after the Fall that Adam and Havah first clothe\r\nthemselves with coats of skin made for them by Yahveh himself.\r\n\r\nThe late lamented George Smith believed that amongst the fragments of\r\nthe Chaldean Genesis, discovered by him, one might be interpreted as\r\nrelating to the fall of the first man, and that it contained the curse\r\npronounced upon him by the God Ea, after his transgression.[62] But this\r\nwas an illusion, which a more profound study of the cuneiform document\r\nhas dispelled. Smith's translation, which was too hasty, immature, and,\r\nmoreover, hardly intelligible, turns out erroneous from beginning to\r\nend. Since then Mr. Oppert has given us an entirely different version of\r\nthe same text,[63] the first possessing a really scientific character,\r\nin which the general meaning becomes tolerably clear, though there are\r\nstill many obscure and uncertain details. One thing at least is now\r\nquite established: the fragment has no kind of reference to original sin\r\nand the curse of man. We must therefore leave it entirely outside the\r\nsphere of our present researches; endeavouring, however, to convey a\r\nwarning to such as may be tempted, in dependence on the celebrated\r\nAssyriologist, to make use of it in a Commentary on the Bible.\r\n\r\nThus, then, we have no formal and direct proof that the tradition of the\r\noriginal transgression, as told in our Holy Scriptures, formed part of\r\nthe cycle of the records of Babylon and Chaldea, respecting the origin\r\nof the world and of man. Neither do we find any allusion to the subject\r\nin the fragments of Berosus. But, despite this silence, a similarity\r\nbetween Chaldean and Hebrew traditions on this point, as upon others,\r\nhas so great a probability in its favour as almost to amount to a\r\ncertainty. Further on we shall return to certain very valid proofs of\r\nthe existence of myths relating to a terrestrial paradise in the sacred\r\ntraditions of the lower basin of the Euphrates and Tigris. But it\r\nbehoves us to dwell for a few moments on the representations of the\r\nsacred and mysterious plant, guarded by celestial genii, that Assyrian\r\nbas-reliefs so often display. Up to the present time no text has been\r\nfound to elucidate the meaning of the symbol, and we have to deplore a\r\nwant, that no doubt will one of these days be met by the discovery of\r\nnew documents. But the study of these figured monuments alone renders it\r\nimpossible to doubt the high importance of this representation of the\r\nsacred plant. Whether it appear alone, or, as sometimes happens,\r\nworshipped by royal figures, or, as I have just said, guarded by genii\r\nin an attitude of adoration, it is incontrovertibly one of the loftiest\r\nof religious emblems; and what places this character beyond doubt is,\r\nthat we often see above the plant the symbolic image of the Supreme God,\r\nthe winged disc--surmounted or not by a human bust. The cylinders of\r\nBabylonian or Assyrian workmanship present this emblem no less\r\nfrequently than the bas-reliefs of Assyrian palaces, and always under\r\nthe same conditions, and evidently attributing to it an equal\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to avoid comparing this mysterious plant, in which\r\neverything points out a religious symbol of the first order, with that\r\nfamous tree of life and knowledge which plays so prominent a part in the\r\nnarrative of the earliest transgression. All paradisiacal traditions\r\nmake mention of it; the tradition in Genesis, which sometimes seems to\r\nadmit of two trees, one of life and one of knowledge, sometimes of one\r\ntree only combining both attributes, and standing in the midst of the\r\ngarden; the Indian tradition, which supposes four plants on the four\r\ncounterforts of Mount Méru; and, lastly, that of the Iranians, which\r\nsometimes treats of a single tree springing from the very middle of the\r\nholy spring of water, Ardvî-çûra, in Airyana-Vædja, and sometimes of\r\ntwo, corresponding exactly to those of the Biblical Eden. This\r\nsimilarity is so much the more natural, that we find the Sabians or\r\nMendaites, an almost pagan sect, dwelling in the environs of Bussorah,\r\nwho retain a great number of Babylonian religious traditions, to be also\r\nconversant with the tree of life, which they designate in their\r\nScriptures as _Setarvan_, \"that which shades.\" The most ancient name of\r\nBabylon in the idiom of the Ante-Semitic population, _Tin-tir-kî_,\r\nsignifies \"the place of the tree of life.\" Finally, the representation\r\nof the sacred plant which we assimilate with that of the Edenic\r\ntraditions, appears as a symbol of life eternal on those curious\r\nsarcophagi, in enamelled clay, belonging to the latest period of\r\nChaldean civilization, after Alexander the Great, which have been\r\ndiscovered at Warkah, the ancient Uruk.\r\n\r\nThe manner of representing this sacred plant varies in Assyrian\r\nbas-reliefs and exhibits different degrees of complexity.[64] It is,\r\nhowever, invariably a plant of moderate size, of pyramidal form, having\r\na straight stem from which spring numerous branches, and a cluster of\r\nlarge leaves at its base. In one example only[65] is the plant\r\nrepresented with sufficient accuracy to enable us to classify it as the\r\n_Asclepias acida_ or _Sarcostemma vinimalis_, the plant known as the\r\nSoma to the Aryans of India, the Haoma to the Iranians, the crushed\r\nbranches of which afford the intoxicating liquor offered as a libation\r\nto the gods, and identified with the celestial beverage of life and\r\nimmortality. More generally, however, the plant has a conventional and\r\ndecorative aspect, not answering exactly to any natural type, and it is\r\nthis purely conventional form which the Persians have borrowed from\r\nAssyro-Babylonian art, and which represents the Haoma on gems, cylinders\r\nor cones of Persian workmanship in the era of the Achemenides.[66]\r\nSuch an adoption of the most usual shape of the sacred plant of the\r\nChaldeans and Assyrians by the Persians, in order to represent their own\r\nHaoma--although the conventional bore no similarity to the real\r\nplant--proves that they recognized a certain analogy in the conception\r\nof the two emblems. In point of fact the Persians have shown great\r\ndiscernment in their borrowing and adapting; and where they took\r\nChaldeo-Assyrian art for model and for teaching, they only adopted such\r\nof those religious symbols common in the basin of the Euphrates and\r\nTigris, as might be rendered applicable to their own peculiar doctrines,\r\nand even to a very pure Mazdeism. The adoption of the image of the\r\ndivine plant of the Chaldeo-Assyrians in order to represent the Haoma\r\nis, therefore, a conclusive sign that an assimilation of the symbols had\r\ntaken place, and we find in it a new proof in support of the close\r\nconnection between the plant guarded by genii on Assyrian or Babylonian\r\nmonuments and the tree of life of paradisiacal tradition. Indeed, if\r\nIndians vary in opinion as to the nature of the mysterious trees of\r\ntheir earthly paradise of Mènu, even generally admitting of four\r\ndifferent species, and if the Bundehesh-pehlevi, in bestowing on the\r\ntree of Airyana-Vædja the name of _Khembe_, appears to have had in view\r\none of the plants placed by Indians on the counterforts of Mèru--_i.e._,\r\nthe _Panelea orientalis_, which in Sanscrit is called _Kadamba_; it is\r\nthe \"white Haoma,\" the Haoma type that is almost always found in the\r\nsacred books of Mazdeans springing from the middle of the fountain\r\nArdvî-çûra, and distilling the beverage of immortality. The Aryans of\r\nIndia connected a similar idea with their Soma, for the fermented liquor\r\nthat they produced by pounding its branches in a mortar, and offered as\r\na libation to their gods, is named by them _Amritam_, \"ambrosia draught\r\nthat renders immortal.\" The Haoma and its sacred juice is also called\r\n\"that which keeps off death,\" in the ninth chapter of the _Yaçna_ of the\r\nZoroastrians. It is for this reason that, both with the Indians and the\r\nIranians, the personification of the sacred plant and its juice, the god\r\nSoma, or Haoma, prototype of the Greek Dionysius, becomes a lunar\r\ndivinity, inasmuch as he is the guardian of the ambrosia stored by the\r\ngods in the moon. And here we have another similarity forced upon us\r\nwhen we stand before Assyrian bas-reliefs, where the sacred plant is\r\nguarded by winged genii, having heads of eagles or peripterous vultures.\r\nThese symbolic beings present, indeed, a singular analogy with the\r\nGaruda, or rather the Garsudas of Indian Aryans, genii, half men, half\r\neagles. Now, in the Indian myths, more particularly in the beautiful\r\nstory of the _Astika-parva_ of the Mahâbhârata, it is Garuda who\r\nreconquers the ambrosia _Amritam_--that is, the sacred juice of the\r\nSoma, used for libations, that had been stolen by demons, and who\r\nrestores it to the celestial god, himself remaining its guardian. The\r\npart played by him and by the eagle-headed genii of Assyrian monuments,\r\nwith regard to the tree of life, is consequently the same as that which\r\nwe find in Genesis assigned to _Kerubin_, armed with flaming swords,\r\nwho were placed by God at the gate of Eden, after the expulsion of the\r\nfirst human pair, to prevent the entrance into Paradise, and to guard\r\nits tree of life.\r\n\r\nIn one part at least of Chaldea properly so called, to the south of\r\nBabylon, it appears as though it were no longer the type we have just\r\nbeen considering that was employed to represent the tree of life. It was\r\nthe palm, the tree that furnished the majority of the inhabitants of the\r\ndistrict with food, and with fruit from which they distilled a fermented\r\nand intoxicating liquor, a kind of wine; the tree to which they were\r\nwont to attribute in a popular song as many benefits as there are days\r\nin the year--this palm it was that was there considered the sacred, the\r\nparadisiacal tree. We have the proof of this in cylinders that show us\r\nthe palm surmounted by the emblem of the Supreme God, and guarded by two\r\neagle-headed genii. Moreover, the essential character of the tree of\r\nlife lies in its fruits affording an intoxicating juice, the beverage of\r\nimmortality; and accordingly the books of the Sabians or Mendaites\r\nassociate it with the tree Setarvan, \"the perfumed vine,\" Sam Gufro,\r\nabove which hovers \"the Supreme Life\" in the same way as does the\r\nemblematic image of divinity in its highest and most abstract form above\r\nthe plant of life in the monumental representations of Babylon and\r\nAssyria.\r\n\r\nAnd, further, the fact that in the cosmogonic traditions of the\r\nChaldeans and Babylonians respecting the tree of life and paradisiacal\r\nfruit, there was contained a dramatic myth, closely resembling in form\r\nthe Biblical narrative of the Temptation, appears to be as positively\r\nestablished as may be in the absence of written texts, by a cylinder of\r\nhard stone preserved in the British Museum.[67] There we actually see a\r\nman and woman, the former wearing on his head the kind of turban\r\npeculiar to Babylonians,[68] seated opposite each other on either side\r\nof a tree, from whose spreading branches two big fruits hang--one in\r\nfront of each of the figures who are stretching out their hands to\r\ngather it. A serpent is rearing himself behind the woman. This\r\nrepresentative might serve as a direct illustration of the narrative in\r\nGenesis, nor as M. Friedrich Delitzsch has observed, can it lend itself\r\nto any other interpretation.\r\n\r\nM. Renan has no hesitation in agreeing with ancient commentators in\r\nfinding a vestige of the same traditions among the Phenicians in the\r\nfragments of the Book of Sanchoniathon, translated into Greek by Philo\r\nof Byblos. In point of fact it is there told, in connection with the\r\nfirst human pair, that Aion--which seems a rendering of Havah--\"invented\r\nfeeding on the fruits of the tree.\" The learned academician even thinks\r\nhe discovers in this passage an echo of some type of Phenician figured\r\nrepresentation, retracing a scene such as that recorded in Genesis, and\r\nvisible on the Babylonian cylinder. Certain it is that, at the epoch of\r\nthe great influx of Oriental traditions into the classic world, we see a\r\nrepresentation of the kind figure on several Roman sarcophagi, where it\r\nindicates positively the introduction of a legend analogous to the\r\nnarrative of Genesis, and associated with the myth of the formation of\r\nman by Prometheus. One famous sarcophagus in the Capitol Museum displays\r\nin the neighbourhood of the Titan, son of Japetos, who is performing his\r\nwork as modeller--a pair--man and woman--in the nudity of primeval days,\r\nstanding at the foot of a tree, the man's gesture showing that he means\r\nto gather its fruit.[69] We meet with the same group in a bas-relief\r\nbuilt into the wall of the small garden of the Villa Albani in Rome,\r\nonly here it is in still closer conformity with the Hebrew tradition, as\r\na huge serpent is coiled round the trunk of the tree beneath which the\r\ntwo mortals are standing. It is this plastic type that was imitated and\r\nreproduced by the earliest Christian artists, when they attempted the\r\nrepresentation of the fall of our first parents, which formed so\r\nfavourite a subject with them, both in sculpture and painting.\r\n\r\nOn the sarcophagus of the Capitol the presence in proximity of\r\nPrometheus of one of the Parcæ drawing the horoscope of the man whom the\r\nTitan is forming, leads us to suspect in these sculptured subjects the\r\ninfluence of the doctrine of those Chaldean astrologists who had spread\r\nthemselves, during the later centuries before the Christian era,\r\nthroughout the Greco-Roman world, and had acquired an especial amount of\r\ncredit in Rome. Nevertheless, the date of these last monuments renders\r\nit possible to look upon the representation of the first pair beside the\r\ntree of Paradise, of which they are about to eat, as directly borrowed\r\nfrom the Old Testament itself, as well as from the cosmogony of Chaldea\r\nor Phenicia. But the existence of this tradition in the cycle of the\r\nindigenous legends of the Canaanites seems to me placed beyond doubt by\r\na curious painted vase of Phenician workmanship of the seventh or sixth\r\ncentury B.C., discovered by General di Cesnola, in one of the most\r\nancient sepulchres of Idalia, in the Isle of Cyprus.[70]\r\n\r\nThere we actually see a leafy tree, from the branches of which hang two\r\nlarge clusters of fruit, while a great serpent is advancing with\r\nundulating movements towards the tree, and rearing itself to seize hold\r\nof the fruit.[71]\r\n\r\nNow, we are justified in doubting that in Chaldea, and still more in\r\nPhenicia, a tradition parallel to the Biblical account of the Fall ever\r\nassumed a significance as exclusively spiritual as it does in Genesis,\r\nor that it contained the moral lesson also to be found in the story as\r\ngiven in the Zoroastrian scriptures. The spirit of grossly materialistic\r\nPantheism in the religion of those lands rendered this impossible.\r\nNevertheless, we may remark that among the Chaldeans, and their\r\ndisciples the Assyrians, at all events from a given epoch, the notion of\r\nthe nature of sin and the necessity of repentance was to be found more\r\nprecisely formed than amongst the majority of ancient peoples, and\r\nconsequently it is difficult to believe that the Chaldean priesthood did\r\nnot, in their profound speculations on religious philosophy, seek for\r\nsome solution of the problem of the origin of evil and sin.\r\n\r\nWith the foregoing reservation, it is, indeed, probable that the\r\nChaldean and Phenician legend of the fruit of the tree of Paradise was\r\nnearly akin in spirit to the cycles of ancient myths common to all the\r\nbranches of the Aryan race. To the study of these M. Adalbert Kuhn has\r\ncontributed a book of the highest interest.[72] He deals with such as\r\nrefer to the invention of fire, and to the beverage of life. These are\r\nto be found in their most ancient form in the Vedas, and they then\r\npassed over, more or less modified by the course of time, to the Greeks,\r\nRomans, Slavs, as well as the Iranians and Indians. The fundamental\r\nconception of these myths, which are only to be found complete in their\r\noldest forms, is of the universe as an immense tree, whose roots embrace\r\nthe earth, and whose branches form the vault of heaven.[73] The fruit of\r\nthis tree is fire--indispensable to human existence, and the material\r\nsymbol of intelligence; and the leaves distil the Elixir of Life. The\r\ngods had reserved to themselves the possession of fire, which sometimes,\r\nindeed, descends on earth in the form of lightning, but which men were\r\nnot themselves to produce. He who--like the Prometheus of the\r\nGreeks--discovers the method of artificially kindling a flame, and\r\ncommunicates this discovery to other men, is impious, has stolen the\r\nforbidden fruit from the sacred tree, is accursed, and the wrath of the\r\ngods pursues him and his race.\r\n\r\nThe analogy between these myths and the Bible narrative is striking\r\nindeed. They are, really, one and the same tradition, only bearing a\r\nquite different sense, symbolizing an invention of a material order,\r\ninstead of dwelling on the fundamental fact of the moral order, and\r\ndisfigured further by the monstrous conception, too frequent in\r\nPaganism, of the Divinity as a formidable and adverse power, jealous of\r\nthe happiness and progress of man. The spirit of error among the\r\nGentiles had distorted the mysterious symbolic memory of the events by\r\nwhich the fate of humanity was decided. The inspired author of Genesis\r\ntook it up under the form that it had evidently retained among the\r\nHebrews, as among the other nations where it had acquired a material\r\nmeaning, but he restored to it its true significance, and made it the\r\noccasion of a solemn lesson.\r\n\r\nSome remarks are still needed regarding the animal form assumed by the\r\ntempter in Bible story, that serpent who, as figured monuments have\r\nshown us, played the same part in the legends of Chaldea and Phenicia.\r\n\r\nThe serpent, or, more correctly speaking, different kinds of serpents,\r\nheld a very considerable place in the religious symbolism of the peoples\r\nof antiquity. These creatures figure therein with most opposite\r\nmeanings, and it would be contrary to the laws of criticism to group\r\ntogether confusedly, as some learned scholars were once wont to do, the\r\ncontradictory notions linked in old myths with different serpents, so as\r\nto form out of them one vast Ophiological system,[74] referred to a\r\nsingle source, and brought into relation with the narrative in Genesis.\r\nBut by the side of divine serpents, essentially benign in character,\r\nprotective, prophetic, linked with gods of health, life, and healing, we\r\ndo find in all mythologies a gigantic serpent, who personifies a hostile\r\nand nocturnal power, a wicked principle, material darkness, and moral\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nAmong the Egyptians we meet with the serpent, Assap, who fights against\r\nthe sun and moon, and whom Horus pierces with his weapon. Among the\r\nChaldeo-Assyrians we find mention made of a great serpent called the\r\n\"enemy of the gods,\" _aiub-ilani_. We need not introduce here the myth\r\nof the great cosmogonic struggle between Tiamat, the personification of\r\nChaos, and the god Masuduk, related in a portion of the epic fragments,\r\nin cuneiform character, discovered by George Smith. Tiamat assumes the\r\nform of a monster often repeated on monuments, but this form is not that\r\nof the serpent. We are distinctly told that it was from Phenician\r\nmythology that Pherecides of Syros borrowed his account of the Titan\r\nOphion, the man-serpent precipitated into Tartarus, together with his\r\ncompanions, by the god Kronos (El), who triumphed over him at the\r\nbeginning of things, a story strikingly similar to that of the defeat\r\nof the \"old serpent, who is the accuser and Satan,\" repulsed and\r\nimprisoned in the abyss, which story does not, indeed, occur in the Old\r\nTestament, but existed among the oral traditions of the Hebrews, and\r\nmakes its appearance in Chapters xii. and xx. of the Apocalypse of St.\r\nJohn.\r\n\r\nMazdeism is the only religion in whose symbolism the serpent never plays\r\nany but an evil part, for even in that of the Bible it sometimes wears a\r\nbenign aspect, as, for instance, in the story of the brazen serpent. The\r\nreason is, that in the dualistic conception of Zoroastrianism the animal\r\nitself belonged to the impure and fatal creation of the evil principle.\r\nThus, it was under the form of a great serpent that Angromainyus, after\r\nhaving tried to corrupt Heaven, leaped upon the earth; it was under this\r\nform that Mithra, god of the pure sky, fought with him; and, finally, it\r\nis under this form that he is eventually to be conquered and chained for\r\n3000 years, and at the end of the world burned up with molten\r\nmetals.[75]\r\n\r\nIn these Zoroastrian records, Angromainyus, under the form of a serpent,\r\nis the emblem of evil and personification of the wicked spirit as\r\ndefinitively as is the serpent of Genesis, and this in an almost equally\r\nspiritual sense. In the Vedas, on the contrary, the same myth of the\r\nconflict with the serpent has a purely naturalistic character, evidently\r\ndescribing an atmospheric phenomenon. The idea most frequently repeated\r\nin the ancient hymns of the Aryans of India at their primitive epoch, is\r\nthat of the struggle between Indra, the god of the bright sky and the\r\nazure, and Ahi, the serpent, or Vritra, the personification of the\r\nstorm-cloud that lengthens out crawling in the air. Indra overthrows\r\nAhi, strikes him with his lightnings, and by tearing him asunder sets\r\nfree the fertilizing streams that he contained. Never in the Vedas does\r\nthe myth rise above this purely physical reality, never does it pass\r\nfrom the representation of the warring atmospherical elements to that of\r\nthe moral conflict between good and evil, as it does in Mazdeism.\r\n\r\nAccording to a certain school of modern mythologists, of which M.\r\nAdalbert Khun is the most prominent representative in Germany, this\r\nstorm-myth is the pivot on which hinges a universal explanation of all\r\nancient religions whatever. And in particular the fundamental source,\r\norigin, and true significance of the traditions we have been reviewing,\r\nincluding the Biblical accounts of the Fall, are all, according to him,\r\nto be looked for in this naturalistic fable of the _Vedas_. No doubt the\r\nallegory which served as starting-point to this myth was not unknown to\r\nthe Hebrews. We find it distinctly expressed in a verse of the Book of\r\nJob (chap. xxvi. 13), where it is said of God, \"By his Spirit he hath\r\ngarnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.\" Here,\r\nindeed, by the parallelism of the two clauses of the verse, the former\r\ndetermines the meaning of the latter. But the Vedic myth is only one of\r\nthe applications of a symbolic statement, of which the source does not\r\nlie among the Aryans; but must be sought much further back in the\r\nprimitive thought of humanity, anterior to the ethnical separation of\r\nthe ancestors of Egyptians, Semites, and Aryans, of the three great\r\nraces represented by the three sons of Noah; for it is common to all.\r\nThe pastoral tribes, whence sprung the Vedic hymns, only connected it\r\nwith an idea exclusively naturalistic, almost childish, and specially\r\ndrawn from the phenomena that most interested their simple existence, to\r\nwhich all advanced civilization, whether material or intellectual, was\r\nstill foreign. But among the Egyptians the same metaphor appear with a\r\nfar more general and elevated significance. The serpent Assap is no\r\nlonger the storm-cloud but the personification of darkness, which the\r\nsun, under the form of Ra or Horus, encounters during his nocturnal\r\npassage through the lower hemisphere, and has to triumph over before he\r\nappears in the east. Thus, the conflict between Horus and Assap is daily\r\nrenewed at the seventh hour of the night, a little before the rising of\r\nthe sun, and the \"Book of the Dead\" shows that this strife between light\r\nand darkness was taken by the Egyptians as the emblem of the moral\r\nstrife between good and evil. Neither is the serpent the mere\r\nstorm-cloud in those paradisiac legends of Chaldea and Phoenicia in\r\nwhich we have been able to discern a relation in form to the record in\r\nGenesis. The aspect of the cloud lengthening out in the sky may, indeed\r\n(I could not positively deny it without more positive certainty) have\r\nfurnished the first germ of the idea of constituting the serpent the\r\nvisible image of the adverse power, combining the intimately associated\r\nideas of darkness and of evil--a notion from which, by a confusion of\r\nthe physical and moral orders, no ancient religion, not even Mazdeism,\r\nwas entirely able to free itself, unless it were that of the Hebrews.\r\nBut with all the highly civilized peoples whose traditions we have\r\nscrutinized, the great serpent symbolizes that dark and evil power in\r\nits widest significance.\r\n\r\nBut be this as it may, my faith as a Christian finds no difficulty in\r\nadmitting that, in order to relate the fall of the first pair, the\r\ninspired compiler of Genesis made use of a narrative which had assumed\r\nan entirely mythical character among neighbouring peoples, and that the\r\nform of a serpent assigned to the tempter may have had for\r\nstarting-point an essentially naturalistic symbol. Nothing obliges us to\r\nunderstand the third chapter of Genesis literally. Without any departure\r\nfrom orthodoxy we are justified in looking upon it as a figure intended\r\nto convey a fact of a purely moral order. It is not, therefore, the form\r\nof the narrative that signifies here, but rather the dogma that it\r\nexpresses, and this dogma of the fall of the human race through the bad\r\nuse that its earliest progenitors made of their free will, remains an\r\neternal truth which is nowhere else brought out with the same precision.\r\nIt affords the only solution of the formidable problem which constantly\r\nreturns to rear itself before the human mind, and which no religious\r\nphilosophy outside of revelation has ever been able to solve.\r\n\r\n  FRANÇOIS LENORMANT.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] The system is thus expounded in the \"Laws of Manu,\" i. 68-86. For\r\nits ulterior developments see Wilson, Vishnu-Purana, pp. 23-26, and\r\n259-271.\r\n\r\n[51] Theopompus, cited by the author of the treatise \"On Isis and\r\nOsiris,\" attributed to Plutarch (c. 47), already pointed out this\r\ndoctrine as existing among the Persians.\r\n\r\n[52] Ewald calculates the four ages of the world which he believes he\r\nhas discerned in the Bible as follows:--1. From the Creation to the\r\nDeluge; 2. from the Deluge to Abraham; 3. from Abraham to Moses; 4. from\r\nthe Promulgation of the Mosaic Law. Such epochs have scarcely any\r\nresemblance to the Ages of Hesiod or of the Laws of Manu. And, moreover,\r\nit is well to note that wherever we meet simultaneously, as we do with\r\nIndians, Iranians, and Greeks, with the existence of the four ages and\r\nthe tradition of the Deluge, these are completely independent of each\r\nother, have no connection whatever, which indicates a difference of\r\norigin, from sources having nothing in common. Nowhere does the Deluge\r\ncoincide with the transition between two of these ages.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is a point where a certain approximation may be\r\nestablished between the theories of India and those of the Bible. The\r\nLaws of Manu say that in the four successive ages of the world the\r\nduration of human life goes on decreasing in the proportion of 4, 3, 2,\r\n1; in the Bible we have the antediluvian patriarchs, with the exception\r\nof Enoch, who was translated to Heaven, living about 900 years.\r\nSubsequently Shem lives 600, and his three first descendants between 430\r\nand 460; to the four succeeding generations there is assigned a life of\r\nbetween 200 and 240 years; finally, from the time of Abraham the\r\nexistence of the patriarchs comes nearer to normal data, and no longer\r\nreaches a maximum of 200 years.\r\n\r\n[53] \"Vendidâd,\" ii. It is also related how Yima preserved the germs of\r\nmen, animals, and plants from the Deluge.

Windeschman has rightly compared this with Genesis\r\nix. 3.\r\n\r\n[61] \"Bundehesh,\" xv.\r\n\r\n[62] \"Chaldean Account of Genesis,\" p. 83.

We see no objection to this, provided, however,\r\nthat it be admitted that the monument shows the introduction of a legend\r\nsimilar to that of Adam and Havah, attached to those personages. As the\r\nprobable theatre of such an introduction, one might be led to think of\r\nIconia in Asia Minor, when the formation of men by Prometheus was, by\r\nlocal tradition, assigned to a period immediately succeeding the deluge\r\nof Deucalion, and told with details singularly akin to those given in\r\nthe Bible.\r\n\r\n[70] Cesnola: \"Cyprus: its Ancient Cities, Tombs, and Temples,\" p. 101.\r\n\r\n[71] We must limit ourselves, must not be carried away into exaggerated\r\ndevelopments. We will not, therefore, carry these analogies further. But\r\nthey might be pursued in a direction that shall be briefly pointed at.\r\nIt is difficult to avoid seeing a similarity between the Tree of\r\nParadise of Asiatic Cosmogonies, and the tree of golden fruit in the\r\ngarden of the Hesperides, guarded by the serpents which figured\r\nmonuments invariably represent coiled about its trunk. In that myth of\r\nincontestably Phenician origin, according to which Hercules slays the\r\nguardian serpent and secures the golden apples, we have the revenge of\r\nthe luminous or solar god reconquering the tree of life from a dark,\r\njealous, and inimical power, personified by the serpent, which had taken\r\npossession of it in the world's early days. In the same way we have in\r\nthe Indian myth the gods regaining the ambrosia from the Asouras or\r\ndemons that had stolen it. We may also observe that Hercules, the\r\nconqueror of the dragon of the Hesperides, is also the liberator of\r\nPrometheus, him who first, despite the divine prohibition, gathered\r\nfire, the fruit of the celestial and cosmic tree.\r\n\r\n[72] \"Die Herabkunft des Feuers und die Göttertranks.\" Berlin, 1859.\r\n\r\n[73] On the existence among the Babylonians of the idea of the cosmic\r\ntree, see C. W. Mansell, _Gazette Archéologique_, 1878, p. 138.\r\n\r\nAmong the myths borrowed by the philosopher Pherecides, of Syros, from\r\nthe Phenician mysteries, was that of the winged-oak ([Greek: hupopteros\r\ndrus]), over which Zeus had spread a magnificent veil representing the\r\nconstellations, the earth and ocean. Here we manifestly have the cosmic\r\ntree again.\r\n\r\n[74] Mr. Fergusson's work, \"Tree and Serpent Worship\" (London, 1868), is\r\nnot quite free from this defect, the learned author having displayed\r\nmore erudition and ingenuity than critical faculty.\r\n\r\n[75] \"Bundèhesh,\" xxxi. The serpent's form is also that given to\r\ndifferent secondary personifications of the evil principle, different\r\nmythological beings created by Angromainyus to ravage the earth, and war\r\nwith the good, and with the true faith--such as Azhi-Dahâka (the serpent\r\nthat bites), conquered by Thraetaina, and the dragon Cruvara, slain by\r\nthe hero Kereçaçpa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL AND INTELLECTUAL LIFE IN GREECE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ATHENS, _August, 1879_.\r\n\r\nIf during this latter period of our national existence, which from every\r\npoint of view presents one of the most serious crises in our history,\r\nall Europe finds itself agitated by constant commotions, Greece, which\r\nmore than any other European nation is interested in the various events\r\nof the Eastern crisis, is truly under the power of a national paroxysm.\r\nThe serious modifications which have been accomplished in the state of\r\naffairs in the East were of a nature to exert a great influence on\r\nGreece, threatening each day to swallow up that country in the tempest.\r\nDoubtless, it was impossible for Greece to remain indifferent at a time\r\nwhen nations, but till lately unknown, were created by caprice or\r\ninterest, without themselves having any sentiment of their national\r\nexistence, and which now threaten her national and political future in\r\nthe East. The armed protests of Crete, of Epirus, of Thessaly, and of\r\nMacedonia, were but the commencement of a general participation of\r\nHellenism in the struggle between the Slavs and the Turks, and doubtless\r\nof a more serious complication of the Eastern Question, to the great\r\ndismay of European diplomacy, which can not or will not re-establish the\r\nequilibrium between the different national elements which struggle\r\nfiercely with each other in the Balkan Peninsula. It was only the demand\r\nmade on Greece by united European diplomacy, at the commencement of the\r\nwar in the East, that she should remain neutral, and the promises made\r\nto her that she should not be forgotten in a Congress of the Powers\r\nrelative to the improvement of the state of things in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, which induced her to restrain her national aspirations, and to\r\nawait that justice from a European Congress, which she was on the point\r\nof claiming by arms. However, the delay which has occurred up to the\r\npresent time in the solution of the question of the delimitation of the\r\nHellenic frontiers--which is still pending between the Greek Government\r\nand the Sublime Porte--is a sad sign of the blindness of the Turkish\r\nGovernment, and equally hurtful to both peoples, paralyzing their\r\nprogress in civilization. For if this question were once settled, they\r\nwould be able to turn their attention to another quarter--that, namely,\r\nwhere the common interests and dangers of the two peoples meet. For not\r\nonly the Sublime Porte, but Europe also, should well understand that a\r\npredominance of the Hellenic element in the East has in nowise for its\r\nobject to satisfy the ambitious tendencies of a race. Modern\r\ncivilization is in danger of being overrun by the furious waves which\r\nthreaten to carry away everything in the Russian Empire. Those\r\nfundamental principles of Russian Society, those ideas (extravagant and\r\nanti-social in all points of view) of a Panslavist Cæsarism, and the\r\nprinciples of Nihilism, and of other social and religious sects, so\r\nabsurd and so contrary to human nature, between which there is just now\r\nraging a combat so keen and so barbarous, are symptoms fatal to\r\ncivilization and to the peace of Europe, and the forerunners of a\r\ncatastrophe near at hand. Slavism, which is as ancient as the Latin and\r\nGerman nationalities, has not, up to the present time, personified any\r\ncivilizing element in European history. Its proper character is\r\ndespotism, and in recent times it is anarchy in its most inauspicious\r\nand frightful aspect. Consequently, Europe must open her eyes to the\r\ndanger which threatens her. A nationality which, from the very beginning\r\nof its historical activity, represents principles of society and of\r\ncivilization in a state of decadence--at a period when it should be full\r\nof youth and of ideality--ought to be seriously studied by those who\r\ndirect the destinies of the West. Not only is the preponderance of\r\nPanslavism in the East a menace and a danger for the future and for the\r\nregeneration of Hellenism, but dangers and complications more grave\r\nthreaten all Europe, in consequence of such preponderance. The Cossack\r\nin the East, at Constantinople or near it, signifies nothing else but an\r\nentire and immediate overturning of the European equilibrium and of\r\nmodern civilization. A man who well knew Russia and the Russians, the\r\nfamous author of the \"Soirées de Saint Petersbourg,\" has written these\r\nwords:--\"We must know how to set bounds to Russian desire, for by its\r\nnature it is without limits.\" Deeply significant words of Joseph de\r\nMaistre! The history of Russian policy is a development of this idea.\r\nThe public conscience of Europe ought to meditate upon and consider that\r\nperil which the Marquis of Salisbury exposed with so much lucidity and\r\nprecision in that famous and memorable circular addressed to the Powers\r\nof Continental Europe--that circular which had made us hope, but in\r\nvain, for the advent of a new era in the history of English diplomacy\r\nand in the progress of international morality. But now we must, alas!\r\nrepeat the famous saying of M. de Beust: \"There is no longer any\r\nEurope!\"\r\n\r\nWe hoped, in common with the whole of the free and enlightened opinion\r\nof Western Europe, that this circular of the noble Marquis, containing\r\nthe exalted traditions of George Canning with respect to the Hellenic\r\ncause, was about to inaugurate a new era in European diplomacy. What,\r\nthen, was the motive for the sudden change in British diplomatic policy\r\nduring the Berlin Congress? Lord Beaconsfield, on his return from\r\nBerlin, attempted to throw a doubtful light on this mysterious change in\r\nthe policy of the Cabinet of St. James's, when he finished his speech\r\nwith this vague remark, which has since become so celebrated among us:\r\n\"Greece has a future; and if I might be permitted to offer her my\r\nadvice, I would say to her, as to every individual who has a future,\r\nLearn to wait.\"\r\n\r\nWe refrain from examining here the motives for this change, because we\r\nbelieve it is very difficult to lift the veil which covers the mysteries\r\nof the political inconstancy of the Cabinet of St. James's; and leaving\r\nthe solution of this enigma to time, that great OEdipus of history, we\r\nwill here make only this remark, that English diplomacy has allowed a\r\nfavourable opportunity to escape for taking the initiative in all the\r\ngreat questions which concern the general interests of civilization, and\r\nthis notwithstanding the hopes which Lord Salisbury's circular for an\r\ninstant caused us to entertain. However, the propitious moment has not\r\nyet passed away. France, which appears at this moment to be holding\r\naloft the standard of the policy first enunciated by the Marquis of\r\nSalisbury, serves not only the interests of Greece and of Europe, but\r\nalso those of England.\r\n\r\nBeware of the North! In the triumph of the Panslavist idea there is not\r\nonly the absorption of Hellenism, there is something of still more\r\ngeneral interest, which for some time past should have furnished\r\nEuropean diplomacy with matter for reflection, before the icy blast of\r\nthe North, changing our fears into realities, obliges diplomacy to\r\nsubmit to accomplished facts.\r\n\r\nEurope to-day, in proceeding with the execution of a decision of the\r\nCongress, is not only doing a work of importance, but also a work of\r\njustice in repairing the wrong which she formerly committed in narrowing\r\nthe limits of the Greek kingdom, and hindering the physical development\r\nof its people. The political prophets of the time when this new European\r\nState was created--Palmerston, Leopold of Belgium, Metternich--were\r\nunanimous in pointing out how doubtful was the future of this nation,\r\nwhich had not the elements necessary to a regular life, and which,\r\nconsequently, was incapable of fulfilling the exalted mission which\r\nEurope had confided to it in creating it. What was the cause of this\r\nniggardliness of the Powers towards a nation full of youth and activity,\r\nat the very moment of its creation? Mr. Gladstone has already told us in\r\nthis REVIEW.[76]\r\n\r\nGreece, which, more than all the other Eastern races, had always the\r\n_pre-eminence_ intellectually and morally, might, in concert with the\r\nWest, and making herself, so to speak, the organ of its views in the\r\nEast, become a powerful barrier against that torrent of Slavism which\r\nfor some time past has threatened to overwhelm the Balkan peninsula.\r\n\r\nIn that ethnological pandemonium, which is called the Peninsula of the\r\nBalkans, of which so many nationalities dispute the possession, to the\r\nexclusion of the only possessors whose rights are consecrated by\r\nhistory, Greece seems to be the only nationality which, better than all\r\nthe other races,--most of which lack historic traditions and a true\r\nnational consciousness,--is capable of realizing the views of Europe for\r\nthe fulfilment of which, on the initiative of England, the European\r\nCongress was convoked at Berlin. It was, doubtless, these principles\r\nwhich inspired the Congress when, in Article 13 of the Treaty, it\r\nordered the annexation to Greece of the bordering provinces of Epirus\r\nand Thessaly; this was a reparation of the political fault committed at\r\nthe time of the creation of the new kingdom. However, a dishonest policy\r\non the part of Turkey delays up to this moment the accomplishment of the\r\nTreaty fulfilled by her in its other Articles. She has reaped its\r\nadvantages, but she seems not to wish to submit to its sacrifices. We\r\ncannot conceive what benefit the Sublime Porte derives from this vain\r\ndelay. It ought to understand that it will not gain anything from this\r\ncontinual paroxysm with which it finds itself struggling since the last\r\nEastern crisis. And we see with satisfaction that public opinion in\r\nTurkey has already acknowledged that an enlargement of Greece, even at\r\nthe expense of Turkey, is not contrary to the interests of the two\r\nraces, whose common peril from the Slavs is indisputable. Turkey must\r\nseek the centre of her activity and power in Asia, where she may play an\r\nimportant part, and not in Europe, where she has always remained a\r\nstranger, and has never succeeded in creating an indigenous and national\r\ncivilization. It will one day depart from Europe, this Mussulman race,\r\nwhich for five centuries has only encamped in Europe, without leaving\r\nany memorial of civilization or morality, except a few pages of military\r\nhistory. It can carry European civilization to the nations of Asia,\r\ninitiating them into its mysteries, by means of a wiser government and a\r\nmore enlightened activity. This is the true and just policy of Turkey in\r\nthe future. By the cession of the provinces where the Turkish element is\r\n_nil_ she will gain much more strength than by their retention, which\r\ncannot be of any profit to her.\r\n\r\nWe hope that Turkish statesmen, whose enlightenment and intelligence are\r\nwell known, will recognize the urgent necessity for a sincere\r\nunderstanding between the two neighbouring States on the basis of the\r\ncession of the two provinces in accordance with the Berlin Treaty; then\r\nperhaps, later on, a union may be formed in order to oppose the common\r\nenemy. The obsolete policy of _non possumus_, behind which Turkey\r\npersists in sheltering herself has been, on more than one occasion,\r\nhurtful and fatal to her.\r\n\r\nThe province of Epirus, without the town and department of Jannina, is\r\nlike a body without a head. The town of Jannina, which fills so\r\nglorious a page in the modern history of Hellenism, has been ever since\r\nits foundation the capital of Epirus in every point of view. It is only\r\nthe bad faith of the Turkish Government which could take advantage of\r\nthe inconceivable patriotism of the Albanians to create all of a sudden\r\nan Albanian nationality. It is true that there does exist an Albanian\r\nrace, an insignificant branch of that powerful tree of the Hellenic\r\nfamily; but this race has never played an important, independent, free\r\npart in history. Once only, in the time of Scanderbeg, does Albania\r\nappear to have fulfilled a separate mission, in fighting against the\r\nTurks for the liberty and independence of her rugged mountains; but the\r\nbrilliant star of this memorable and almost unique epoch in the poor\r\nhistory of Albania, the famous hero of Croia, according to recent\r\nresearches into this part of the history of the Middle Ages, was not of\r\nAlbanian origin. In those long combats for Hellenic liberty and\r\nindependence, when the Albanian race fought with the _ilephtes_ and\r\n_armatoles_ of the national regeneration, it was not an Albanian idea\r\nwhich inspired those brave champions of our independence: it was the\r\nGreek standard, it was the _sabanum_ of Constantine, under the shadow of\r\nwhich the tyrant was combated by the Greek patriots, and by those who,\r\nin this time of sophism and paradoxes, plume themselves upon Albanian\r\nnationality, in claiming with incomparable _naïveté_, in documents and\r\nmanifestoes in which historical traditions are disfigured, the\r\nindependence and liberty of a nation which never existed in history.\r\nThese mountaineers, these intrepid combatants in a holy cause, remained,\r\nduring all that revolutionary epoch of Greece, in the rear of the\r\nHellenic idea, which was doubtless their national idea. This idea\r\nimpresses its peculiar stamp on the life of the nation, in its material,\r\nmoral, and intellectual existence; but such has never existed in the\r\nAlbanian race. Unity of history, of language, of religion, all that\r\nconstitutes the essence of nationality, is altogether wanting in the\r\nAlbanians. This is not the time to discuss all the obsolete and\r\nparadoxical things which have lately been said about the Albanians by\r\nanthropologists, ethnologists, &c. &c. We do not wish, either, to\r\npronounce against them the death-sentence of the celebrated geographer\r\nKiepert, who wrote some time ago in the _National Zeitung_ of Berlin,\r\n\"We think the total dissolution of this part of an important and very\r\nancient nation, which always retrogrades\" to be very probable, and\r\nuseful for European interests. Doubtless, the Albanians have a right of\r\nhistorical existence; but that history in which is always represented\r\nmore or less the famous scientific conception of the great naturalist of\r\nmodern times, the _struggle for existence_, is favourable only for those\r\nwho know how to work and struggle successfully in the arena of\r\ncivilization. Up to this moment, this race has been entirely unknown in\r\nhistory. A learned German naturalist, Haeckel, has found in this region\r\nof Eastern Europe the rudiments of a savage life exactly resembling as\r\nto manners the state of pre-historic times, especially in Upper Albania,\r\nwhere this race has a numerical and national preponderance. The\r\nAlbanian nationality, then, about which its _soi-disant_ representatives\r\nhave made so much noise, has no real existence, and is at this day but a\r\nnational Utopia, a _terra incognita_, existing only in the ardent\r\nimagination of certain high functionaries of the Sublime Porte, and\r\ncertain religious fanatics of Mussulman Albania. As for the\r\nnon-Mussulmans, they still remain supporters and friends of the Hellenic\r\nidea and of the Greeks, with whom they have always made common cause,\r\nand have played a glorious part in our history by their courage and\r\npatriotism. Let the Albanians show by their European culture that there\r\nare among them the elements of a compact race which has the full\r\nconsciousness of its individuality; and, what is more important, let\r\nthem abstain from declaring to-day against Hellenism, by becoming the\r\ninstruments of treacherous movements whose sole aim is their absorption.\r\nThe object of the Hellenic idea is not the absorption of the races with\r\nwhich it is called to live; it is neither fusion nor conquest, as has\r\nbeen more than once proved in history. It is only in the Greeks that the\r\nAlbanians will find their natural friends and allies; it is only with\r\nthem that they will not lose their national individuality, because they\r\nare their brothers, retarded in the history of humanity and of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nBut if the idea of an independent and peculiar Albanian race and\r\nnationality is shown to be false by ethnological research and by\r\nhistorical documents, it is a still greater error and a ridiculous\r\npretension to say that the town of Jannina is the centre and the capital\r\nof the Albanian idea and nationality. This argument, which for some time\r\npast has been going the round of Europe, and which has found supporters\r\nin Italy,--in the Italian Government unfortunately,--is truly pitiable,\r\nand unworthy of being seriously debated, in the view of those who are at\r\nall acquainted with the history of modern Greece. But since, in these\r\ntimes of vain questions and useless and sophistical debates about the\r\npeoples of the East, much has been written and argued on this question\r\nin the European press, we think it may not be out of place to give some\r\ninformation on the political and intellectual state of Jannina, its\r\npopulation, and the historical and moral traditions of the town, which\r\nwas formerly, prior to the creation of the new kingdom, the intellectual\r\ncapital of Hellenism.\r\n\r\nJannina is, of all the districts of Epirus, that in which the Greek\r\npopulation is the most numerous and the most compact. Out of 100,000\r\ninhabitants of this district, there are only 5000 Mussulmans; and these\r\nalso are of Greek origin, because they all speak Greek. And in Turkey in\r\nEurope, Jannina is the most Hellenic village, in which there is not one\r\ninhabitant who does not speak the language of the country. It is,\r\nperhaps, an historic curiosity, but still it is a fact which has already\r\nbeen proved, that the Sublime Porte has no right of conquest over this\r\ntown, because Jannina has not been conquered by the Turks, but has only\r\nrecognized the Turkish rule by a treaty which guaranteed to it all the\r\nrights of self-government--rights which were afterwards trampled under\r\nfoot in consequence of a rising in the unfortunate town. In the\r\nseventeenth century, at the very dawn of the Hellenic revival, Jannina\r\nwas already a centre of light which illumined the dark sky of Hellenism;\r\nfor a long time this part of Epirus was the mother-country of the\r\ngreatest patriots, and the most earnest propagators of national\r\neducation. Athens was but a village, known only through history, when\r\nthis town was already the central point of the national consciousness;\r\nthe capital of the learning of the dispersed nation, which was without a\r\npolitical official centre. In the famous school of this town, afterwards\r\ncalled [Greek: Zôsimaia Scholê] (The School of Zosimas), illustrious\r\nprofessors taught Greek literature; and, according to the testimony of\r\nmany travellers, Jannina was the town whose inhabitants spoke the most\r\ncorrect Greek. Our national historian, M. Papparigopoulos, speaks thus\r\nof it in his French work, already well known and esteemed in\r\nEurope[77]:--\"Jannina especially became a true nursery of teachers, who\r\nin their turn were placed successively at the head of other schools in\r\nPeloponnesus, in continental Greece, in Thessaly, in Macedonia, at\r\nChios, at Smyrna, at Cydones, at Constantinople, at Jassy, at\r\nBucharest.\" The intellectual superiority of this town lasted until the\r\ndeath of Ali Pasha and the creation of the new kingdom, when the centre\r\nof the moral and political activity and work of the nation was\r\ntransferred to Athens, the town which, from its grand traditions, was\r\nworthy to become once more the capital of the great Hellenic idea. But\r\nthe school of Jannina still remains one of the most renowned and the\r\nmost useful centres for the propagation of the learning and literature\r\nof Ottoman Greece. At this day, for the foreigner who visits the capital\r\nof the kingdom of the Hellenes, the first spectacle which will attract\r\nhis attention will be that majestic view of national monuments, worthy\r\nto be compared with the most renowned monuments of the European cities:\r\nthese are the University, the Academy, the Polytechnic School, the\r\nArsakion, the Seminary of Rizari, &c., all eloquent witnesses of the\r\npatriotism and self-sacrifice of the nation. Who are the founders of\r\nthese monuments? By what means have these brilliant ornaments of the\r\nHellenic revival been constructed? The greater part of their generous\r\nfounders are Epirotes, natives of Jannina itself, that town of which one\r\nof the most illustrious _savants_ of regenerated Greece spoke with so\r\nmuch appropriateness when he compared its school to a great river which\r\nhas given rise to several streams, which in their turn have watered and\r\nfertilized all the other towns of Greece, but which to-day, contrary to\r\nall reason and to historic truth, is represented as the Albanian\r\ncapital, and finds for this strange idea supporters who willingly\r\nsacrifice the rights of populations to political interests and\r\nnecessities; a sad but eloquent sign of the moral confusion of our\r\ntimes, and of the bad faith which dominates over the political and\r\ninternational conceptions of some Governments.\r\n\r\nThe political life of Greece has, doubtless, been very stormy of late\r\nyears. The state of confusion and uneasiness which followed the\r\nexpulsion of King Otho, and, later, the unfortunate issue of the Cretan\r\nrising, acted to some extent as a drag on the peaceful progress of the\r\nnew kingdom. Besides this, the adoption of a political Constitution\r\ndissimilar and entirely strange to our customs and political and social\r\nhabits, the introduction of what is called in political language the\r\nConstitutional _régime_, transplanted from the cloudy region of England\r\nto the sunny climate of Greece, has not proved the political panacea\r\nwhich had been hoped for by the enthusiasm of the political ideologists\r\nof our times. Already, and especially during the last fifteen years, the\r\nintellectual life of a young nation full of health and vigour has been\r\nwasted foolishly in a barren struggle about political formalities, while\r\nother questions, more serious and more vital to the national\r\ndevelopment, have been neglected. No doubt we may console ourselves with\r\nthe thought that we are neither the first nor the last for whom the\r\nfruit of the political wisdom of old Albion has proved so bitter and so\r\nindigestible, and that other nations of the Continent, more advanced\r\nthan ourselves in civilization, have committed the same fault of not\r\ntaking into account that the Government of a nation is not a mere\r\nquestion of forms, but that it ought to be the expression of its moral\r\nand social life, that it ought to represent its historical traditions\r\nand political aspirations. Like most of the Continental nations, we also\r\nhave the external forms of the English Constitution, without having its\r\ninternal essence, which constitutes the real value of its political\r\ninstitutions,--viz., Self-government. It is true that the political\r\nwisdom of nations does not improvise itself, nor reveal itself all at\r\nonce in its fulness, as Minerva of old sprang from the head of Jupiter,\r\nclad in complete armour, but that it develops itself during their\r\nhistoric progress amidst vicissitude, and by turning to profit the\r\nlessons of trial and experience. It is this that gives us the hope that\r\nin future our nation, enlightened by the painful events of which we are\r\nnow reaping the sad fruits, will become more clear-sighted, especially\r\nafter the annexation of the new Hellenic provinces, when the need will\r\nbe the more felt for a revision of our political system, and the\r\nreconstruction of our new political edifice on a basis more real, more\r\nsolid, more durable, and more in conformity with our national character,\r\nwith our needs, and with contemporary aspirations. Our political life,\r\nespecially during its latter years, instead of adding a page to our\r\ncontemporary history, has, on the contrary, consumed and wasted\r\nfoolishly many of our intellectual faculties which might have been more\r\nusefully employed. At the moment when vague questions, which were\r\nuseless to our national and political development, were being gravely\r\ndebated in the Parliament of Athens, Greece might, with a more perfect\r\npolitical Constitution and military organization, have shown herself\r\nfully in a position to face the storm which still agitates the Balkan\r\npeninsula; might have shown herself to be a respectable Power, capable\r\nof measuring her strength with her enemies. The East was in flames, the\r\npopulations of the Balkans in full revolt, only the Government of Athens\r\nhad no definite policy. Whilst the Greeks of Turkey were waiting\r\nimpatiently, and turning their eyes to the Cabinet of Athens, this\r\nlatter, under the presidency of M. Coumoundouros, remained inactive and\r\nirresolute. When the danger became more serious, and all parties, under\r\nthe impulse of an obsolete illusion, had united themselves in order to\r\nform that common Government which our press has called the OEcumenical\r\nGovernment, then was seen in all its obviousness the political\r\nincapacity of those parties who for fifteen years past had governed\r\nGreece, without doing anything, and without thinking of the important\r\nand serious position which Greece might have occupied in the East. This\r\ncoalition ministry, without principles and without political aim, was\r\ndriven from office, after a period of internal languor, in order to give\r\nplace to M. Coumoundouros, the skilful perplexer of our policy, worthy\r\nto be compared in more than one respect with Walpole, whose memory,\r\ndoubtless, does not occupy an illustrious and honourable page in English\r\npolitical history. It is this same uncertainty and confusion which\r\nreigns to this day in the thoughts and in all the actions of the\r\nGovernment, which under a wiser and more politic direction might and\r\nought to say the last word in those negotiations, which already have\r\nbeen going on for a year between the Cabinets of Europe, on the subject\r\nof the new frontiers of Greece.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut if our political life cannot call forth the admiration and\r\nenthusiasm, nor win the applause of an impartial judge, the individual\r\nand social progress of the nation, on the contrary, in many points of\r\nview, compensates us to some extent for our political inexperience and\r\nincapacity in these latter times. If the Hellenic State, wearing a dress\r\nwhich is burdensome and strange to its customs and its free\r\nindividuality, cannot advance as it should do, on the other hand society\r\nhas in other respects made immense progress. The impulse which has been\r\ngiven to the active mind of the nation of late years is in every way\r\nremarkable. In its social development Greece does not encounter any\r\nobstacle which hinders the march of its civilization. The ancient\r\nclass-divisions of Europe, which are now exciting terrible passions that\r\nthreaten the overthrow of the social edifice, have no cause of existence\r\nunder the calm and happy sky of regenerate Greece. The social work of\r\nthe progress and development of the national forces goes on here without\r\nobstacles, in a perfect accord of all classes of society. We have not\r\nhere classes having opposite aspirations, suspected one by the other,\r\nand ready to engage in a deadly struggle. We only want political wisdom,\r\nand then Greece, which has not to-day to expiate past faults, because\r\nshe has already expiated many of them, will be capable of becoming a\r\npolitical society worthy of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nWe recommend to the readers of this REVIEW two works recently published\r\nin French, in which they will be able to study the progress of Greece\r\nsince its regeneration. These are--\"La Grèce telle qu'elle est,\" by M.\r\nMoraitinis; and \"La Grèce à l'Exposition universelle de Paris en 1878,\"\r\nby M. Mansolas, director of the Office of Statistics, in which may be\r\nfound a record of the social and intellectual work which in the space of\r\nfifty years has transformed Greece, by changing the uncultivated desert\r\nof former times into a prosperous and vigorous society. The apology of\r\nmuch-misunderstood and much-decried Hellenism is made by the eloquence\r\nof the figures in this history, which is symbolical of its spirit. The\r\nregenerate country, by comparison with the other provinces which have\r\nremained under the yoke of Turkey, witnesses to the work which has been\r\naccomplished, and which has transformed the aspect of Greece, thanks to\r\nits national and political enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago Greece emerged from a catastrophe: she had been deprived\r\nof everything and devastated by a long and desperate war; she was\r\nwithout resources, without agriculture, without commerce, without\r\nmanufactures, without the least social or political organization;\r\neverything had perished during her long struggle for independence,\r\nexcept her genius and her faith in the future. This faith has already\r\nwrought marvels. Agriculture, which is _par excellence_ the basis of the\r\nprosperity of nations, has made considerable progress; its development\r\ngoes on day by day in geometrical progression. Thus, in the space of the\r\nlast fifteen years there have been taken into cultivation nearly\r\n5,000,000 acres. The number of inhabitants engaged in the cultivation of\r\nthe soil, including the shepherds, is, according to the census of 1870,\r\n562,559 out of the 901,387 inhabitants (among the 1,457,894 inhabitants\r\nof the kingdom) whose employment could be stated. Of this number 218,027\r\nare agriculturists, properly so called. This is the chief industry of\r\nthe country. Like agriculture, manufactures have also made considerable\r\nprogress of late. We extract from M. Mansolas' book the interesting\r\ndescription which he gives of the state and progress of manufacturing\r\nindustry in Greece:--\r\n\r\n\"Any one returning to Athens after an absence of fifteen years would\r\ncertainly be surprised to see, on landing at the Piræus, tall chimneys\r\nby the side of the railway station, and the vast district of industrial\r\nestablishments which has been formed, where a few years ago one did not\r\nsee a single cottage, a tree, or a blade of grass.\r\n\r\n\"When we consider that all these manufacturing establishments which one\r\nsees in Greece are the work of a few years, we shall learn with interest\r\nwhat progress has been made in so short a space of time, and so much the\r\nmore so since all this is due to individual enterprise, to the\r\nassociation of capital, and to competition, that universal condition of\r\nthe progress of nations as of individuals. The various manufactories in\r\nwhich steam-power is employed, distributed among the different towns in\r\nthe kingdom, have been founded since 1863; their saleable value is over\r\n£1,000,000 sterling. They spend £1,600,000 in raw material, about\r\n£100,000 in fuel, and turn out products of the value of nearly\r\n£2,000,000. Seven thousand three hundred and forty-two operatives, male\r\nand female, are employed in these establishments, which, under the\r\nimpulse of the national industry, are multiplying and developing\r\nthemselves daily with considerable rapidity. Again, it is a Greek, an\r\nEpirote, Evangeli Lappa, at whose cost have been instituted, under the\r\nname of [Greek: Olympia], exhibitions of agriculture, and manufactures\r\nevery four years, in which, conformably with the fundamental statutes,\r\nall the products of Hellenic industry are to be represented, and\r\nparticularly its manufactures, its agriculture, and cattle-breeding. A\r\nmagnificent palace, erected expressly for it at the cost of the generous\r\nfounders, is destined to receive, when finished, the fourth exhibition\r\nof the [Greek: Olympia].\"\r\n\r\nIn common with agriculture and manufactures, trade is likewise making\r\nconsiderable progress. It is to the commercial spirit of the Greeks, of\r\nwhich traces are everywhere seen, that we owe the considerable extension\r\nwhich commerce has undergone in Greece since her national regeneration.\r\nHer general trade shows the following figures:--\r\n\r\n  Year.     Imports.       Exports.\r\n\r\n  1865     £3,196,403      £1,775,775\r\n  1874      4,261,870       2,663,662\r\n\r\nThe spirit of association, under every aspect, is the secret of human\r\nprogress and development in modern times. In Greece this idea,\r\nessentially human, of association has not yet realized the grand results\r\nin the way of progress which we admire in the rest of Europe. The\r\npoverty of the country, recently delivered from general destruction, is,\r\ndoubtless, one of the chief causes of this. However, since the year\r\n1868, a great impetus has been given to our national life in respect of\r\nassociation. The first company was formed in 1836. From that time to the\r\npresent 144 joint-stock companies have been created at different dates.\r\nOf all these companies there remain at this day fifty, witnesses to the\r\nvitality of the country, and to the constant progress of Greece. This\r\nfact is still more clearly affirmed by the operations of the National\r\nBank of Greece.\r\n\r\nThis bank, established in 1842 with a capital of £165,000 divided into\r\n5000 shares, possesses to-day a capital of £600,000. While in the year\r\nfollowing its establishment (1843) the highest amount of its note\r\ncirculation only reached £12,500 that of its discounts £85,000 and that\r\nof its advances £6500; in 1877 the note circulation reached £1,500,000,\r\nits discounts £3,800,000, and its commercial advances £1,100,000. The\r\nannual dividend has increased from about £3 per share in 1846 to £8\r\n6_s._ 6_d._ in 1875.\r\n\r\nIt is in the budget more especially that we may ascertain this great\r\nnational progress which is manifesting itself under every aspect of\r\nHellenic life. The revenue of the kingdom, according to the budget for\r\nthe year 1879, amounted to over £1,600,000, while at the date of the\r\nestablishment of the first monarchy the total of the ordinary public\r\nrevenue was £260,000.\r\n\r\nThis extension of the vital forces of the nation is, doubtless, a\r\nvisible progress. We have not yet arrived at the completion of the\r\nnational work necessary to place us on the level of European\r\ncivilization. Much has yet to be done; but this does not depend only on\r\nthe good-will and the capacity of the inhabitants. The too narrow limits\r\nof the kingdom, the political uncertainty which has weighed upon the\r\nlife and upon the future of the country, particularly during recent\r\nyears, divert the attention of the Government and of the nation to more\r\ngeneral and more urgent matters. The peaceful labour of the country has\r\nnot, however, been entirely suspended during the late period of\r\nagitation and crisis, when the cannon was thundering in close proximity\r\nto us. The material and social progress which has taken place during the\r\nlast three years shows the confidence which the nation has in herself,\r\nin her mission, and her future.\r\n\r\nAlready, since the creation of the new kingdom, the West, regretting in\r\nsome sort what it had just done, had shown itself very severe towards\r\nGreece. After the phil-Hellenic enthusiasm a singular change supervened\r\nin the sentiments of Europe. A calculating and scornful spirit had\r\nsucceeded that fever of generosity which produced the day of Navarino.\r\nIt was thought that a Liliputian could play the part of a giant.\r\nImpossibilities were asked of a new State, without means, without\r\nresources, scarcely risen from the tomb of oblivion and ruin. If\r\nclear-sighted men of this period had been listened to--Leopold of\r\nBelgium, Palmerston, Metternich even--Greece would have had limits more\r\nnatural in order that she might breathe and act more freely. This\r\nyoungest child of the European States would to-day be a strong Power,\r\ncapable of struggling against the Panslavist spectre in the East, and of\r\nrealizing the projects of the West in this country of the Balkans which\r\nappears to be menaced by Muscovite conquest. However, if in a military\r\npoint of view Greece cannot to-day be the chief actor, she yet remains\r\nthe most important factor of civilization in the East in intellectual,\r\npolitical, and ethnological respects. It is the indomitable genius of\r\nthis nation which in the darkest moments of its historical life has been\r\nable to throw some brilliant flashes over the history of the human race.\r\nIt is Greek industry which to-day plays _par excellence_ the most active\r\npart in the propagation of culture in the East. Intermediate between the\r\nWest and the East, the Greeks assimilate with an astonishing rapidity\r\nthe results of progress; and the ancient East, that unfortunate mummy of\r\nhistory, begins to be born again, to revive, to breathe, to speak, like\r\nthe legendary statue of Memnon, under the breath and at the approach of\r\nthe new spirit casting its vivifying rays on the motionless and silent\r\nbody of the _alma mater_ of human civilization.\r\n\r\nHere is a country which formerly existed and which lived only in its\r\npast, and which to-day presents itself with promises, aspirations,\r\nclaims on the future. It was only an historic tradition, a sad souvenir,\r\na geographical expression, a land of the dead, where everything was\r\nlacking except the sun, which still shone as a lamp which cast a\r\nmournful light on the tomb of a departed glory. This land has to-day\r\nbecome quite young again. There are towns now, where formerly the\r\nshepherd led his flock silently among the ruins of a past which he did\r\nnot know. Athens, formerly an insignificant village, is to-day the\r\nfinest town in the East, and may be compared with the first cities of\r\nthe West. She numbers, according to the recent census, more than 70,000\r\ninhabitants; the Piræus, which contains more than 20,000 of this number,\r\nhas latterly become the centre of the industrial activity of the new\r\nState. All the large towns of Greece are now centres of commerce, of\r\nmanufactures, of culture. The population which existed at the time of\r\nthe creation of the new kingdom has been doubled, in consequence of the\r\nmaterial development of the country, whose prosperity is every day\r\nattracting foreign capital. The credit of Greece is assured in the\r\nmoney-markets of Europe in consequence of the much desired agreement\r\nwhich has been come to between the Government and the creditors of the\r\nunfortunate loan of 1824. Already the _Times_ is raising its voice in\r\nfavour of the Greek exterior loan recently contracted at Paris. Greece\r\nhas, indeed, yet other unworked resources; she lacks only sufficient\r\nmeans by the aid of which she might continue her civilizing march in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe disquietude and uncertainty in the condition of Eastern affairs\r\nwhich have followed upon the war and changed the political condition of\r\nthe Balkan peninsula have not been able to completely arrest the\r\nintellectual movement which is a peculiar trait of the Hellenic race. On\r\nthe contrary, there has in recent years been observed in the life of the\r\nnation a more active and serious tendency to a radical improvement and a\r\nmore complete reorganization of the education of the country, and\r\nparticularly of popular instruction. This famous word, which for some\r\ntime past has been going the round of Europe, and according to which it\r\nwas the German schoolmaster who gained the victory over France, is in\r\nGreece also, as everywhere in Europe, the watchword of the day, which\r\noccupies individuals as well as the Government. The impetus which was at\r\nfirst given by the _Syllogoi_ on this fundamental question of a more\r\ncomplete instruction of the nation has been followed by the Government,\r\nwhich does not ordinarily distinguish itself by taking the initiative in\r\ngeneral questions which do not particularly affect its political\r\ninterests. Primary normal schools, on the model of those of Germany,\r\nwithout, however, losing sight of the character and the individuality of\r\nthe Hellenic mind, have been founded in different parts of the kingdom,\r\nand in the Turkish provinces; and we hope that this lively and generous\r\nimpulse will produce the most glorious and most useful fruits in the\r\nfuture of the nation. A thorough and living popular education is always\r\nthe fundamental basis of the morality and liberty of nations. It is\r\nalways the surest guarantee of their intellectual and national\r\nindependence. In modern society, in which, according to the famous\r\nsaying of Royer Collard, democracy moves like a ship in full sail, in\r\nwhich the people, by universal suffrage, take a direct part in the\r\naffairs of the State, popular instruction ought to be always very\r\nextensive and scattered abundantly among the people. We would even say,\r\nquoting from M. Jules Simon, that no citizen who does not know how to\r\nread and write ought to take any part in the concerns of the State. Our\r\nGovernments unfortunately do not take the initiative in order to revive\r\nthe noble tendencies of the nation. However, there are here individuals,\r\nassociations, and societies (_Syllogoi_), who, in a way different from\r\nthat which is taking place in other countries, have the preponderance\r\nand make up for the deficiencies of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt is to the \"Society for the Propagation of Greek Literature\" that we\r\nowe this new impetus which has been given to public instruction. Popular\r\ninstruction, methodical, practical, according to principles and\r\nexperience of modern science, at present occupies all the enlightened\r\nminds in our nation, both in independent Greece and in the Greek\r\nprovinces of Turkey. The principal aim of this society is the\r\ninstruction of the two sexes, especially in the Greek communities of\r\nTurkey, and the publication of works useful for the young and for the\r\npeople generally. It has, according to the latest returns, founded at\r\nThessalonica a model school similar to those of Germany, in which are\r\nfour classes, five masters, and 118 pupils. It has, moreover,\r\nestablished in the same town a normal school to educate masters for\r\nprimary instruction. This same Society has also opened, in several\r\ncommunes and communities of enslaved Greece, schools for boys and girls.\r\nIt has subsidized several schools in the communes of Greece and in the\r\nGreek communities of Turkey concurrently with other Societies, which\r\nhave the same end in view, of instructing the people and of maintaining\r\nthe patriotic idea in the Greek provinces of Turkey, which the rising\r\nwave of Panslavism to-day threatens to engulf. In order to attain this\r\nobject, the Society has, up to the present time, published several works\r\nof instruction, and has expended considerable sums in the purchase and\r\ndistribution of books for the use of the people. It has founded at its\r\nown cost, or aided by the liberality of generous fellow-countrymen,\r\nseveral prize competitions, the most important of which have for their\r\nsubjects the Greek language, education in Greece, the mercantile marine\r\nof the country, labour, the improvement and encouragement of\r\nagriculture, manufactured and artistic products, commerce, and the\r\nmeans of communication and circulation in general. At the present moment\r\none of our fellow-countrymen, who knows how to put his fortune to the\r\nmost noble use, M. Zaphiropoulo, a rich merchant of Marseilles, has\r\nplaced at the disposal of the Society the necessary funds for publishing\r\nsome geographical maps, in order to give a better knowledge of the\r\nhistorical geography of Greece. These maps are those of \"Ancient\r\nHellenism,\" of \"Macedonian Hellenism,\" and of \"Hellenism during the\r\nMiddle Ages.\" These maps, taken in conjunction with that which was\r\nrecently published at the cost of the same donor, will serve to give the\r\nmost exact and complete idea of the historic and national unity of\r\nHellenism.\r\n\r\nThe \"Parnassus,\" a Society of young men connected with literature and\r\nthe sciences, has for its object the progress of the nation and general\r\nusefulness. This Society is developing day by day, and will soon become\r\none of the most active and serviceable agents of the literary education\r\nand the scientific movement of the country. The Parnassus pursues this\r\naim by the reading during its sessions of articles and memoirs, by the\r\ncollecting of documents and materials relating to the language, songs,\r\nand popular legends, as well as by the publication of these works in a\r\nReview which appears under the title of [Greek: Neoellênika Analekta].\r\nIn this collection are published popular songs of modern Greece,\r\nriddles, proverbs, distichs, tales, &c. Under the auspices of this same\r\nSociety is published another Review, bearing the name of the _Syllogos_,\r\nwhich has already won, by its articles so interesting and full of\r\nlearning, the first place in the periodical press of Greece. But what\r\nspecially indicates the exalted and philanthropic point of view in which\r\nthis Society has placed itself is the foundation of a school, almost\r\nunique of its kind, and which does not exist even in Europe--that which\r\nis called the \"School for Poor Children.\" In this school the classes are\r\nheld in the evening. They comprise reading, writing, arithmetic,\r\ngrammar, physical geography, Greek history, and elements of natural\r\nphilosophy and chemistry. It is an interesting sight to see attending\r\nthese lessons each evening a number of orphan children, who, by means of\r\na suitable education, will one day be good citizens and useful members\r\nof society, whose enemies they would probably have become had they\r\nremained without education and without a moral influence on their\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps needless for me to enlarge upon other learned societies\r\nand associations having an analogous object in view--such as the\r\nArchæological Society, the Association of Friends of the People, the\r\nLeague of Instruction, the Musical and Dramatic Society, and other\r\nsimilar ones, which demonstrate that activity of the Greek mind--always\r\nvigorous, always aspiring after moral victories--which is the\r\ncharacteristic feature of all its history.\r\n\r\nThis movement was manifested in a brilliant manner some time ago, when\r\nthe general congress of all the societies and associations assembled\r\nunder the initiative of the Parnassus Society. This was a most evident\r\nproof of the intellectual and national unity of Greece. Representatives\r\nfrom all points wherever Hellenism is scattered--of free Greece, of\r\nenslaved Greece, and of the Greek colonies established in all parts of\r\nEurope--assembled at Athens, that Jerusalem of the dispersed people. The\r\ncongress, which lasted a fortnight, discussed several questions touching\r\nthe future of Greece and her mission in the East. We are unable at this\r\nmoment to say what were the results. What we hope is that from this\r\nmoment may commence a new era of work and of activity, greater, more\r\nimportant, than that which has already preceded our modern history.\r\nAlone, more or less proscribed, finding in the policy of the Western\r\nPowers only a cold indifference, our future depends entirely upon\r\ncontinual and persevering labour. Greece, though, doubtless, she has not\r\nyet produced men worthy to be compared to the ancients,--those masters\r\nin every branch of science, art, and literature,--is nevertheless the\r\nmost active agent in the propagation of Western civilization in the\r\nEast. We have seen this phenomenon produced in the Congress of the\r\n_Syllogoi_, where might be seen the representatives of Athens and of\r\nConstantinople, of Macedonia and of Asia Minor, of Alexandria and of the\r\nGreek colonies established in Europe--of all places, in short, where the\r\nbeautiful and sonorous Greek tongue makes itself heard--discussing all\r\nthe questions which constitute the vital force of Hellenism. The words\r\nof an ancient writer who called Athens \"the Greece of Greece\" were\r\nbrought to my memory when the president, in a parting address to the\r\nmembers of the congress, called this latter \"the organized manifestation\r\nof the public consciousness, and the incarnation of the intellectual\r\nunity of the nation.\"\r\n\r\nThis unity is concentrated in the University of Athens. This is the most\r\nbrilliant star, which directs the nation in the ways of civilization and\r\nprogress. It exercises a great and salutary influence as well in the\r\nfree country as in the neighbouring provinces. Pupils of the University\r\nof Athens become zealous apostles, who propagate in all corners of the\r\nEast devotion to the national sentiment, and reawaken the ancient\r\ntraditions and hopes of the future. At the doors of the University young\r\nmen from all the Hellenic countries, who will form the generations of\r\nthe future, meet and mingle, more and more. This fusion of the nation,\r\nfortunately already begun by those great struggles for independence\r\nduring which all have passed through the same dangers and kept up the\r\nsame combats under the same standard, the University is gradually\r\ncompleting, by prosecuting unremittingly the double aim which it\r\nproposes to itself,--that is to say, the education and the unity of the\r\nHellenic race. More than two hundred doctors of every branch of science\r\ngo forth from the University annually, and spread themselves throughout\r\nthe East, among the Greeks or other nations, carrying with them the\r\nsalutary influence of civilization and of the spirit of modern times.\r\nThe University, which includes four chief faculties, possesses at the\r\npresent time an endowment of nearly £166,000, made up of the donations\r\nof various liberal fellow-countrymen, one of whom, recently deceased,\r\nbequeathed to it £33,000. According to the return of the last rector of\r\nthe University, from the foundation to the end of the academical year\r\n1877-78, 8426 students have attended the lectures, of whom 3130 have\r\nobtained diplomas. We think that in these figures, more than in the\r\nwhole of our argument, may be seen that vital force of Hellenism which\r\nit exercises on the destinies and the future of the East.\r\n\r\nThe character of the intellectual movement in Greece is didactic rather\r\nthan scientific, in the widest acceptation of the term. We have not yet\r\nhere those strifes and debates which at the present time agitate and\r\nenliven the modern mind in Europe. We teach, and teach. This is our\r\nmission for the present. Debate, which, if I may so express myself, is\r\nthe luxury of science,--strife, which betokens a vigorous body trained\r\nby labour for the combat, have not yet disturbed the peace of our\r\nintellectual arena. We do not concern ourselves with philosophical,\r\ntheological, or social discussions, and latterly we have abandoned even\r\npolitical discussions, which a few years ago were the exclusive\r\noccupation of the newspapers and of the professional politicians at\r\nAthens and in the provinces, because the whole attention of the nation\r\nhas been turned towards the Eastern Question, the solution of which\r\nconcerns alike its present and its future.\r\n\r\nWe are in the epoch of translations, but not yet in that of production.\r\nOur printing-offices are every day reproducing the results of Western\r\nscience by means of translations, which spread abroad useful information\r\nfor the instruction of the nation.\r\n\r\nThere have not been many original productions within the last few\r\nmonths. M. Koumanondis, the distinguished archæologist, the well-known\r\nauthor of a learned work, [Greek: 'Attikês epigraphai epitymbioi]\r\n(Sepulchral Inscriptions of Attica), frequently publishes in a\r\nPeriodical Review of the University, the [Greek: Athênaion], very\r\ninteresting papers on the archæological discoveries which are daily\r\nbeing made in Hellenic soil. M. Anagnostakis, one of the most eminent\r\nprofessors of our Faculty of Medicine, has recently published two\r\npamphlets full of interest relating to the archæology of that\r\nscience--[Greek: Melitai peri tên optikên tôn archaiôn] (Studies on the\r\nOptics of the Ancients); and another small work in French, \"Encore deux\r\nmots sur l'extraction de la Catarracte chez les Anciens.\"\r\n\r\nBut a work by the eloquent Professor of History at the University is\r\nthat which is most deserving of particular mention--viz., the [Greek:\r\nEpilogos tês historias tou hellênikou ethnous], which has been published\r\nin French under the title of \"Histoire de la Civilisation hellénique.\"\r\nIt is a summary of his large work in five volumes on the history of the\r\nHellenic nation from the most distant period down to our own time. The\r\nwriter has had for his object to establish the idea of Hellenic\r\ncivilization and history, so often called in question in the West. We\r\nmay boldly affirm that the author has attained the object of his labour.\r\nAt a moment when Greece is condemned in Europe unheard, this book has\r\nappeared very opportunely as a defence of Hellenism. It is thus that the\r\nEuropean press characterizes this product of an enlightened patriotism,\r\nin analyzing it in terms as flattering to the author as to the nation\r\nfor whose apology this book serves.\r\n\r\nWe have here made a rapid sketch of the intellectual work of the last\r\nfew months. We do not wish to speak now of other publications and\r\nlabours of young men who promise still more than they realize for\r\nscience. What we have to say to-day is that Greece, which has taken some\r\neminent steps in progress and in modern culture, ought to repeat to\r\nEurope with assurance these words of her Archimedes: [Greek: Dos moi pou\r\nstô kai tên gên kinêsô] (Give me a fulcrum, and I will shake the earth).\r\nThe narrow horizon within which this small kingdom was enclosed when it\r\nwas created does not allow of that intellectual spring and flight which\r\nis necessary for the accomplishment of the views and wishes of those who\r\nsee in Greece the most active and enlightened propagator of civilization\r\namong the peoples of the East. Lord Beaconsfield has said of us\r\nrecently, that we ought to hope, because _the future belongs to us_. I\r\nknow not whether these words are a biting irony of the author of\r\n\"Coningsby,\" or whether they express his sincere opinion on the future\r\nof Greece in the East. Doubtless the future belongs to those who hope\r\nand work; but no nation can produce anything great by struggling on a\r\nsoil so small, so barren, and so narrow, just as no individual can work\r\nefficiently if deprived of every resource, and kept without air and\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nSuch is the position of Greece to-day. She can neither work sufficiently\r\nfor her physical and moral development, nor become powerful and capable\r\nof contending against the Panslavist invasion in the East. Europe will,\r\nno doubt, understand this at last; but it will then be too late.\r\n\r\n  N.

W. H. FREMANTLE.)\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Natal has published his seventh and final volume on the\r\nPentateuch (_The Pentateuch and Book of Joshua critically Examined_, by\r\nthe Right Rev. J. W. Colenso, D.D., Bishop of Natal. Part VII. Longmans:\r\n1879). In the preface he notices the various works, including the\r\nSpeaker's Commentary, the work of Alford on the Pentateuch, and those of\r\nKalisch, Graf, and Kuenen, which have appeared of late years, together\r\nwith the New Table of Lessons, and explains the method of the present\r\nvolume. The body of the work consists of an examination of the\r\nScriptural books from Judges to the Canticles, undertaken with the view\r\nof showing what testimony they yield to the views maintained by the\r\nauthor in the earlier part of the work. Incidentally, however, the books\r\nthemselves come under review, and the opinion of the author on their\r\nage, authorship, and purpose is given. The general results of this\r\nlaborious criticism may be given as follows:--\r\n\r\nIt is believed that five persons or sets of persons, at five different\r\nperiods, composed or rehandled the Pentateuch and the other historical\r\nbooks. These are (1) the first Elohist (E), who was Samuel or one of his\r\nscholars; (2) the second Elohist (_E_), who wrote about the end of\r\nSaul's reign or early in that of David; (3) the Jehovist or Jahvist (J),\r\nwho wrote towards the end of David's or the beginning of Solomon's\r\nreign, who may be identified with Nathan, and may possibly be the same\r\nwith _E_; (4) the Deuteronomist (D), who probably was Jeremiah; and (5)\r\nthe Levitical Legislators (LL), who wrote about 250 B.C., or even later.\r\n\r\nThe share which each of these is supposed to have had in the six first\r\nbooks of the Bible is given in the final appendix, a \"Synoptical Table\r\nof the Hexateuch.\" In another appendix, the author explains the changes\r\nin his views of numerous passages, which have led to the more precise\r\nconclusions now put forward, and the task is attempted of giving (1) the\r\nstory of E alone in Exodus and Numbers, and (2) the story of _E_ and J\r\nby themselves in Numbers, Deuteronomy, and Joshua. Thus the author gives\r\nthe reader the fullest means of judging of his theory.\r\n\r\nIt may be best to give the author's conclusions as to the authorship of\r\nthe various books in order:--\r\n\r\n  Genesis, chiefly written by E and J, with some additions by _E_ and D.\r\n\r\n  Exodus, mostly by J and D, with a shorter narrative by the earlier\r\n    authors.\r\n\r\n  Leviticus, a very late work, wholly by LL.\r\n\r\n  Numbers, mainly by J and D, but with considerable additions by LL.\r\n\r\n  Deuteronomy, almost wholly by D, but with a few verses by J and LL.\r\n\r\n  Joshua, shared between all the writers, but in the proportions indicated\r\n    by the numbers 1, 1, 4, 4, 7.\r\n\r\n  Judges, mostly by E.\r\n\r\n  1 Sam. to 1 Kings xi., by J.\r\n\r\n  The rest of the books of Kings, by D.\r\n\r\n  The books of Chronicles, Ezra, and half Nehemiah, by LL; a late,\r\n    hierarchical, and quite untrustworthy work.\r\n\r\n  Esther, a mere romance of a late date.\r\n\r\n  Job, written after the Captivity, about 450 B.C.\r\n\r\n  Psalms, at various times; great stress is laid on Ps. lxviii., which\r\n    is assigned to the age of David, \"the golden age of Hebrew\r\n    literature,\" which produced also the Songs of Moses and Deborah.\r\n\r\n  Proverbs, written at various times from Solomon till after the Exile.\r\n\r\n  Ecclesiastes, in the age of Antiochus.\r\n\r\n  Canticles, in the time of Rehoboam II., about 800, and in the Northern\r\n    kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop believes that the name Jahveh was originally used by some of\r\nthe tribes of Canaan, that it was then merely a name like that of\r\nChemosh or Milum, but that it was adopted by _E_, the great writer of\r\nthe early days of David, as the name of the national deity of Israel,\r\nand inserted by him in his narrative of the Exodus, and under the\r\ninfluence of the Prophets came gradually to be associated with the noble\r\nideas of purity and righteousness.\r\n\r\nThe criticisms upon the authors of the latest books are severe and\r\nvehement. In the books of Chronicles \"the real facts of Jewish history,\r\nas given in Samuel and Kings, have been systematically distorted and\r\nfalsified, in order to support the fictions of the LL, and glorify the\r\npriestly and Levitical body, to which the Chronicler himself belonged.\"\r\nIn the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, not only the whole narrative (except\r\npart of Nehemiah) but also the decrees of the kings of Persia, the\r\nletters of the governor, and the prayers of Ezra and the Levites are\r\n\"pure fictions of the Chronicler;\" and the book of Esther is an\r\nunhistorical romance, suggested by a wish to account for the existence\r\nof the Feast of Purim, which was probably no more than the commemoration\r\nof the choosing by lot of the new inhabitants of Jerusalem in the days\r\nof Nehemiah.\r\n\r\nIt was said by Dr. Arnold that the Old Testament required a Niebuhr; and\r\nBishop Colenso is not a Niebuhr. Indeed, it is but fair to him to say\r\nthat he is modest enough to disclaim functions such as those of the\r\ngreat German, and to regard himself as preparing the way for their\r\nfuture exercise. Many of his criticisms are telling and convincing. But\r\nin his construction he is weak. Even if men can be persuaded that the\r\nemployment of fiction in the Old Testament histories is as extensive as\r\nthe Bishop supposes, and that at every turn they are to be on the watch,\r\nnot only for a Levitical colouring of the narrative but for the most\r\nbarefaced invention, yet they will hardly be persuaded that the name of\r\nMoses should be \"regarded as merely that of the imaginary leader of the\r\npeople out of Egypt, a personage quite as shadowy and unhistorical as\r\nÆneas in the history of Rome or our own King Arthur.\" Indeed, when even\r\nKuenen attempts a reconstruction of the earlier history, his narrative\r\nis merely a bald and meagre statement of the events as usually believed.\r\nThe impartial reader will close this book with the conviction that the\r\ngoal has not been reached, and will await the time when mere criticism\r\nmust give way to positive history.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Bishop of Natal has extended over eighteen years. It\r\ncloses in a different tone and amid different feelings on the subject\r\nfrom those in which it was begun. It arose in a panic about the doctrine\r\nof inspiration; and it created a panic. In the first volume sound\r\ncriticism could hardly see clearly or escape the series of absurdities\r\non account of the clouds of controversy. In the last volume all this is\r\nchanged. The author writes calmly and in the consciousness that many of\r\nthe views it propounds are no longer unacceptable. The present state of\r\ntheological thought in the English Church (how far brought about by the\r\nwork itself each man must judge for himself) is such that any serious\r\ncriticism will be weighed quietly and without prejudice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe plan of the New Testament Commentary for English Readers (_A New\r\nTestament Commentary for English Readers_.) By Various Authors. Edited\r\nby C. J. Ellicott, D.D., Lord Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol. Vol. II.\r\nCassell, Petter and Galpin: 1879 has been given in our notice of the\r\nfirst volume (CONTEMPORARY REVIEW for August, 1878). The second volume\r\nis in every respect worthy of the first. The Acts of the Apostles and\r\nthe Second Epistle to Corinthians are taken by Professor Plumptre; the\r\nEpistles to the Romans and Galatians by Mr. Sanday; the First Epistle to\r\nthe Corinthians by Mr. Teignmouth Shore.\r\n\r\nThe Acts of the Apostles afford Professor Plumptre a congenial field for\r\nhis powers. He considers that the main purpose of the book is \"to inform\r\na Gentile convert of Rome how the Gospel had been brought to him, and\r\nhow it gained the width and freedom with which it was actually\r\npresented.\" He admits, but justifies, the mediating or reconciling\r\ncharacter of the work. This is done successfully, for the most part; but\r\nperhaps his vindication of the omission of the dispute between St. Peter\r\nand St. Paul at Antioch will be felt to be somewhat constrained, both\r\nwhen he remarks that \"there is absolutely no evidence that he (St. Luke)\r\nwas acquainted with that fact,\" and when he says: \"Would a writer of\r\nEnglish Church History during the last fifty years think it an\r\nindispensable duty to record such a difference as that which showed\r\nitself between Bishop Thirlwall and Bishop Selwyn at the Pan-Anglican\r\nConference of 1807?\" The introduction, besides the usual dissertations\r\non the authorship, &c., contains some important and suggestive sections\r\non the relation of the work to the controversies of the time, to the\r\nEpistles of St. Paul, and to external history, and on the sources from\r\nwhich St. Luke probably derived his information. It contains also lists\r\nof the coincidences between the Acts and St. Paul's and St. Peter's\r\nEpistles, of their points of contact with the contemporary history of\r\nthe outer world, and of the incidents which show the naturalness and\r\nveracity of the narrative. The introduction closes with an excellent\r\nchronological table from A.D. 28 to 100.\r\n\r\nThe Book of the Acts is treated throughout as sound history, and this\r\nenables the commentator to find himself at home in all the circumstances\r\nof the contemporary world, both within and without the Church. In the\r\nscene on the Day of Pentecost full scope is allowed to the physical\r\nphenomena, the storm and darkness, the earthquake and the lightning.\r\nAnanias' death is understood as in the familiar phrase \"by the\r\nvisitation of God.\" The state of Peter in his deliverance from prison\r\n(xii. 9) is understood by reference to the phenomena of somnambulism.\r\nThe \"revelation\" by which St. Paul went up to the Council at Jerusalem\r\nis explained in harmony with the assertion of the Acts that he was sent\r\nby the Church at Antioch, as \"a thought coming into his mind, as by an\r\ninspiration, that this was the right solution of the problem.\" The\r\nhealing of the sick by handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched the\r\nbody of St. Paul (xix. 12) is likened to that attributed to the relics\r\nof saints. The accounts of Theudas, Judas, Gamaliel (v. 57), of Claudius\r\n(xi. 28), of Herod (xii.), of the early life of St. Paul (vii. 58), of\r\nthe numbers composing the first congregation at Jerusalem (iv. 37), are\r\ninteresting and suggestive. Under the vivid realizations expressed in\r\nthese notes we seem to see the Apostles sitting in permanent conclave\r\n(iv. 35), the daughters of Philip as members of an incipient, \"order of\r\nVirgins\" (xxi. 9), or the rapacious Felix catching at the words \"alms\r\nand offerings\" when uttered by St. Paul (xxiv. 26). The extreme\r\nfertility of conjecture which we noticed in the Commentary on the\r\nGospels is somewhat chastened, and is exercised in a more legitimate\r\nfield. The possibility, for instance, of Stephen's having had some\r\nconnection with Samaria, as accounting for various statements in his\r\nspeech (note on vii. 16), the possibility that the words of St. Paul's\r\ndescription of God's goodness at Lystra (xiv. 17) may have formed part\r\nof an ancient sacrificial hymn, the conjecture that Apollos may have\r\nbeen the author of the apocryphal Book of the Wisdom of Solomon, are all\r\ninteresting and worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nTurning to Mr. Sanday's portion of the work, on the Epistles to the\r\nRomans and Galatians, we have in the introduction to the former Epistle\r\na vigorous and original conception of the object of both Epistles. We\r\ngive this in the words of the author:--\r\n\r\n     \"The key to the theology of the Apostolic age is its relation to\r\n     the Messianic expectation among the Jews. The central point in the\r\n     teaching of the Apostles is the fact that with the coming of Christ\r\n     was inaugurated the Messianic reign. It was the universal teaching\r\n     of the Jewish doctors--a teaching fully adopted and endorsed by the\r\n     Apostles--that this reign was to be characterized by\r\n     righteousness.... The means by which this state of righteousness is\r\n     brought about is naturally that by which the believer obtains\r\n     admission into the Messianic kingdom,--in other words, Faith.\r\n     Righteousness is the Messianic _condition_, Faith is the Messianic\r\n     _conviction_. But by Faith is meant, not merely an acceptance of\r\n     the Messiahship of Jesus, but that intense and living adhesion\r\n     which such acceptance inspired, and which the life and death of\r\n     Jesus were eminently qualified to call out.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this view, Mr. Sanday, in his analysis of the\r\nEpistle, terms it \"A treatise on the Christian scheme as a\r\ndivinely-appointed means for producing righteousness in man, and so\r\nrealizing the Messianic reign.\"\r\n\r\nThe simple view thus indicated, which is also borne out by the \"Excursus\r\non Faith, Righteousness and Imputation,\" is somewhat impaired by another\r\nExcursus (D), in which Sacrifice is regarded as the infliction of a\r\npenalty. In the notes also this view exercises a weakening influence,\r\nand, combined with some other similar features, produces a sense of\r\nindistinctness. Otherwise, the notes are written with great care,\r\nimpartiality, and freedom. There is a devout sense of the greatness of\r\nthe subject, and much modesty in the treatment of it, while at the same\r\ntime the commentator does not hesitate to treat all the latter part of\r\nGal. ii. as St. Paul's afterthoughts or comments upon his own words (a\r\nsuggestion which has a wide application to other passages both in the\r\nGospels and in the Epistles); or to speak of words such as those of Gal.\r\nv. 10: \"I would that they were even cut off that trouble you,\" as\r\n\"momentary ebullitions\" which \"are among the very few flaws in a truly\r\nnoble and generous character.\" As regards the curious question suggested\r\nby the MS. discrepancies in the last three chapters of the Epistle to\r\nthe Romans--namely, whether the Epistle was sent to the Romans\r\nalone--Mr. Sanday follows Dr. Lightfoot in believing that its original\r\nform was such as we now have it, with the exception of the last three\r\nverses, and that these formed an appendix, added on at the end of\r\nchapter xiv., when, during his captivity at Rome, St. Paul converted the\r\nearlier part into a circular epistle. The interesting view of M. Renan,\r\nwho believes it to have been originally a circular epistle, and takes\r\nthe four endings (xv. 33, and xvi. 20, 24 and 27) as the endings of the\r\ncopies addressed respectively to the Churches of Rome, Asia, Macedonia,\r\nand some other unknown, is rather too curtly discussed with the remark\r\nthat it fails when applied in detail. There is one more serious omission\r\nin this part of the commentary. Though honourable mention is made of the\r\ncommentaries of Dr. Vaughan and Dr. Lightfoot, of Meyer and Wieseler,\r\nAlford and Wordsworth, not a single allusion is made to that of\r\nProfessor Jowett. We can hardly believe that the old theological\r\nprejudice against the author has blinded the present commentator to the\r\ngreat exegetical and philosophical value of Professor Jowett's labours.\r\nBut we cannot account for this strange omission of a work to which all\r\nEnglish students of St. Paul's Epistles are so much indebted.\r\n\r\nThe two Epistles to the Corinthians are commented on respectively by Mr.\r\nTeignmouth Shore and Professor Plumptre. It is hardly possible that\r\nanything new or striking should be written on these Epistles, which in\r\nour day have not only passed through the hands of writers like Alford\r\nand Wordsworth, but have been a specially congenial field for the genius\r\nof F. W. Robertson and of Stanley. But Mr. Shore and Dr. Plumptre have\r\nwell represented to English readers the sense and spirit of these\r\nEpistles and the Church-life which they reveal to us. Mr. Shore's\r\njudgment is, perhaps, at fault in a few special instances; he still\r\nbelieves not only in a non-extant Epistle to the Corinthians, but in an\r\nunrecorded visit of St. Paul to them; in which Professor Plumptre\r\ndiffers from him (conf. p. 285 with note on 2 Cor. xii. 14 and xiv. 1);\r\nhe attributes the words, \"It is good for a man not to touch a woman\" (1\r\nCor. vii. 1) to St. Paul, not to those who wrote to him; and he thinks\r\nthe history of the Last Supper was revealed to the Apostle directly in a\r\ntrance--as to which he might be corrected by Professor Plumptre's\r\nexplanation of St. Paul's \"going up to Jerusalem by revelation\" in the\r\nnote on Acts xv. 2. But these are comparatively small blots, if they be\r\nblots, in an exposition which is well worthy to take its place in this\r\nmost useful of modern Commentaries on the New Testament.\r\n\r\nWe are glad to hear that Professor Plumptre's \"Commentary on the Acts\"\r\nhas been reprinted for the use of schools, and we hope that the other\r\nparts of the Commentary may be similarly treated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe translation of Professor Cremer's \"Biblico-Theological Lexicon,\"\r\nfrom the German, by Mr. Urwick (_Biblico-Theological Lexicon of New\r\nTestament Greek_, by Hermann Cremer, D.D., Professor of Theology in the\r\nUniversity of Griefswald. Translated by W. Urwick, M.A. Edinburgh: T.\r\nand T. Clark), supplies a great want in our helps to the study of the\r\nNew Testament. Parkhurst is out of date and limited in his range of\r\nreference. Winer is a Grammar, not a Lexicon. Archbishop Trench's\r\nSynonyms, with all their value, do not cover the whole ground. The\r\nstudent turns, therefore, with eagerness to such a book as that of\r\nProfessor Cremer. And he will not be disappointed. The book is what it\r\nprofesses to be. The author speaks modestly and truly of his work: \"The\r\nwork which, after a labour of nine years, I have now brought to\r\ncompletion is certainly an attempt only, and effort to do, not a result\r\naccomplished; it simply prepares the way for a cleverer hand than mine.\"\r\nHe writes as an earnest believer, a pupil of Tholuck's, whose\r\ncommentaries he singles out as alone fully investigating the great\r\nconceptions embodied in particular words of the New Testament Greek. He\r\nseems to have been fired by an expression of Schleiermacher's, which\r\nmight be taken as the motto for his work: \"A collection of all the\r\nvarious elements in which the language-moulding power of Christianity\r\nmanifests itself would be an adumbration of New Testament doctrine and\r\nethics.\" Like so many of Tholuck's pupils, he has tested his theology by\r\nthe practical work of the ministry, not, however, neglecting the\r\nstudent's part, which after many years' toil has issued in the important\r\nwork which has won him his professorship. The work has reached a second\r\nedition, and it is from this second edition (which contains an addition\r\nof 120 words) that the present translation is made.\r\n\r\nSome words will, we may hope, be added in future editions. Such a word,\r\nfor instance, as [Greek: thrêskeia] (James i.), which is used for\r\nreligion itself; or, again, such a word as [Greek: pêroô], with its\r\ncompounds, which St. Paul makes the vehicle of so much teaching in\r\nRom. xi.; or [Greek: areskô], a word which may be said to have been\r\nconverted by the language-forming power of Christianity, and others of\r\nequal or greater importance, have as yet no part in this Lexicon. The\r\nclassical use of the words is fully noticed; it is, he says, in many\r\ncases \"a vessel prepared to receive the Christian thought.\" The use of\r\nGreek words in the Septuagint is also worked out, though the author\r\nlaments that the helps for this are so few. Of the Rabbinical or\r\nPost-Biblical writings use is also made, and of some of the earlier\r\nFathers of the Church. But we miss the wide range of varied illustration\r\nfrom mediæval and modern literature which charms us in the work of\r\nArchbishop Trench. One source of illustration is deliberately put aside.\r\n\"The works of Philo and Josephus,\" he says, \"afford little help, because\r\nof their endeavour to import Greek ideas and Greek philosophy into\r\nJudaistic thought.\" Most students will be surprised to find that, even\r\nin reference to the conception of the [Greek: Logos], Professor Cremer\r\nconsiders that Philo's use of the word has no bearing on its use by St.\r\nJohn, which he considers to be simply an adaptation of the \"Word of the\r\nLord,\" as commonly used in the Old Testament and the Rabbinical writers.\r\nThe object of the work is to discover the conceptions or ideas of the\r\nNew Testament (or, as the writer expresses it with Rothe, \"the language\r\nof the Holy Ghost\"), by bringing together the passages in which the\r\nwords are used. Whether he has always succeeded in this, or whether, as\r\nin the case of [Greek: aiôn] (where he says that [Greek: O aiôn mellôn]\r\nis even in Matt. xiii. and xxiv. the new age of the world inaugurated by\r\nthe resurrection of the dead and the second coming of Christ), or as in\r\nthe case of [Greek: sôma] (where he does not even refer to the apparent\r\nuse of the word by St. Paul in 1 Cor. xv. and otherwise elsewhere as\r\nimplying hardly more than personality), he has not at times been\r\ndominated by conventional views, each reader must judge. But every\r\nstudent will find in the careful enumeration of passages, and the\r\ndiscriminating and decided but not dogmatic judgment pronounced upon\r\nthem, materials which will assist him in working out (as each man must\r\ndo) his own theological conceptions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn edition of the Septuagint, with a literal translation into English\r\n(_The Septuagint Version of the Old Testament_; with an English\r\nTranslation, and with various Readings and Critical Notes: Samuel\r\nBagster and Sons), is a work attempted by no one, we believe, before Mr.\r\nBagster, and will be welcomed by the increasing number of thoughtful\r\nstudents of the Bible. There is a short introduction, stating all that\r\nis known of the origin of the Septuagint; the Greek text and English\r\ntranslations are given in parallel columns, in neat and small type,\r\nwhich enables the whole work to be comprised in a moderate quarto\r\nvolume; and short notes are added which notice variations of readings,\r\nalternative translations, and the additions made by the Hebrew original,\r\nand direct attention to the passages quoted from the Septuagint in the\r\nNew Testament. There is also an Appendix noticing a very few words as to\r\nwhich some difficulty arises, and a few passages which are supplied from\r\nthe Alexandrine text. No mention is made of the Apocrypha.\r\n\r\nThe translation is for the most part exact and literal, yet made to read\r\nfluently, where this was possible--perhaps more fluently than the Greek\r\ntext. The following passage from Isaiah ix. 1-5, is a good specimen of\r\nthe translation, and, being well known as the Lesson for Christmas Day,\r\nwill enable the reader to appreciate the singular discrepancies often\r\nexisting between the Septuagint and the original text as it stands in\r\nour Bible. The passage begins in the English version with the words,\r\n\"Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation.\" In\r\nthe translation of the Septuagint it stands thus--\r\n\r\n     \"Drink this first. Act quickly, O land of Zabulon, land of\r\n     Niphthalim, and the rest _inhabiting_ the seacoast and _the land_\r\n     beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.\r\n\r\n     \"O people walking in darkness, behold a great light: ye that dwell\r\n     in the region _and_ shadow of death, a light shall shine upon you.\r\n     The multitude of the people which thou hast brought down in thy\r\n     joy, they shall even rejoice before thee as they that rejoice in\r\n     harvest, and as they that divide the spoil. Because the yoke that\r\n     was laid upon them has been taken away, and the rod that was on\r\n     their neck; for he has broken the rod of the exacters as in the day\r\n     of Midian. For they shall compensate for every garment that has\r\n     been acquired by deceit, and _all_ raiment with restitution; and\r\n     they shall be willing, even if they were burnt with fire.\r\n\r\n     \"For a child is born to us, and a son is given to us, whose\r\n     government is upon his shoulder; and his name is called the\r\n     Messenger of great counsel; for I will bring peace upon the\r\n     princes, and health to him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--ESSAYS, NOVELS, POETRY, &c.\r\n\r\n(_Under the Direction of_ MATTHEW BROWNE.)\r\n\r\nThere is something very winning about Mr. Peter Bayne, who, by-the-by,\r\nhas just received a Doctor's degree from his University, and read\r\nwhatever you will of his, you quit the page with respect and liking for\r\nthe author. You will, indeed, go far to find books or articles which\r\nmore plainly bear the stamp of manliness, kindliness, intelligence, and\r\nwide reading. These are some of the most necessary qualities of a\r\ncritic, whether of life or literature, and most of them are of especial\r\nvalue in historical criticism. _That_ has lately taken up with\r\nprinciples and methods not very favourable to the just appreciation of\r\nsuch a book as Mr. Bayne's last, \"The Chief Actors in the Puritan\r\nRevolution;\" and it struck some of us that the best points in that work\r\nwere missed by too many of its reviewers. A venture of a very different\r\nkind is _Lessons from my Masters: Carlyle, Tennyson, and Ruskin_ (James\r\nClarke & Co.). This large volume has grown out of articles which were\r\noriginally published in the _Literary World_, but these have now been\r\nmuch elaborated by Dr. Bayne, and have received considerable additions.\r\nThe essay on Carlyle is beyond dispute the most valuable of the three\r\nstudies, but they all belong to a class of writing which is sure of a\r\nwelcome. We feel quite certain, however, that Dr. Bayne imposed upon\r\nhimself a little, or more than a little, when he undertook his task. He\r\ntells the reader plainly he found, as he went on with it, that he could\r\nnot maintain the attitude of mere pupil, as he had fancied he might. Of\r\ncoarse not; and he need not have apologized even indirectly for the\r\nfreedom of his criticisms, which might well have been much bolder. The\r\nreal attraction of the work he undertook was, that it _would_ give him\r\nscope for widely-ranging comment; and it is the inevitable, by no means\r\ninartistic or unhealthy discursiveness of the treatment which makes it\r\ndifficult to do justice to it. But we will venture upon a point or two\r\nnearly at random.\r\n\r\nIn discussing \"Model Prisons,\" or rather the assumptions of that\r\nLatter-day Pamphlet, Mr. Bayne takes a view of our duty to criminals\r\nwith which we agree, and he quotes the fact that the majority of those\r\nwho belong to the criminal class are found to have abnormal brains and\r\noften diseased bodies. He also treats just in the way we might expect\r\nthe _dictum_ that stupidity means badness. The last meaning of that, we\r\nalmost fear, Mr. Bayne has not quite caught; as John Bunyan meant it,\r\nand as Carlyle means it, it is surely true. Again, it seems doubtful if\r\nMr. Bayne, in taking up Kant's complaint that, while there is so much\r\nkindness in the world, there is so little justice, has put the complaint\r\nin the right place. It is awfull true, and not to be hidden from any\r\nhonest and acute observer, that the love of justice and truth is very\r\nweak in most human beings; while the instinct of kindness is\r\ncomparatively strong. Again, Dr. Bayne nearly surprises us by adopting\r\nthe commonplace that great talents bring with them an increase of moral\r\nresponsibility. Well, we all know the insuperable difficulties of the\r\nsubject, how they all run up at last into one final problem of which the\r\nmost plausible-looking solutions turn out to be only paradoxes. But,\r\nafter all, can it be maintained that there is really any final\r\ndifference in the degree of moral responsibility to be assigned to a man\r\nwith a constitution like Byron's or Edgar Poe's, and that which is to be\r\nassigned to one of those criminals with abnormal brains? Shelley's\r\ngrandfather was crazed; the father, Sir Timothy, was _half_-crazed; what\r\nShelley was we know. And can we consistently say that his faults (we do\r\nnot speak of any particular act) were one shade less the natural result\r\nof the constitution of his brain than are those of any of Mr. Carlyle's\r\n\"dog-faced\" criminals? Is there any sense in suggesting that the\r\nsplendid powers of such a man ought to be expected to act as breakwaters\r\nagainst the force of his special temptations? Of course we know how the\r\nenlightened British juryman would answer such a question, and equally of\r\ncourse there are rocks ahead answer it as you may; but we must pause a\r\nlittle longer on it than Dr. Bayne does (page 89) over the question\r\n\"What is justice?\"\r\n\r\nPassing over other things, we now come to smoother water--the Essay on\r\nTennyson. Here there is, of course, much to say \"on both sides.\" Many of\r\nus would have liked a little less poet-worship, and a little more\r\nscrutiny. \"The Princess\" is dismissed with a line or two of\r\napology--but it is far more, for Dr. Bayne's purpose, than \"a\r\nserio-comic poem,\"--it contains, indirectly, a great deal of\r\nself-disclosure. There is something very wrong about M. Taine's way of\r\nlooking at Mr. Tennyson's domestic sweetness, but he has a glimpse of a\r\ntruth about the poet and his work. Whatever the worshippers of Mr.\r\nTennyson may say, his poetry contains more feeling after human passion\r\nif haply he may find it, than of passion itself; and he _is_\r\nconventional. He has never been right out and away into the\r\nwilderness. His poetry wants largeness, boldness, and breadth of\r\natmosphere. We find no fault--being profoundly grateful for what this\r\nexquisite singer has given us; and knowing better than to expect\r\ncontradictory qualities from the same harp; and certainly M. Taine has\r\nmade a great blunder in setting up Alfred de Musset on the other side of\r\nhis antithesis--but it is a fact that Mr. Tennyson has shown in his\r\nwritings a tendency (or sub-tendency, if the phrase may pass) to please\r\nMrs. Grundy, as well as the higher Pallas--a tendency which does a\r\nlittle to excuse those who insult the poor old soul without occasion;\r\nand who, indeed, are sometimes thought to be grimacing at the Divine\r\nWisdom, when they are only teasing the old lady.\r\n\r\nThe subject of \"Emendations\" interests Mr. Bayne more than it does us,\r\nand we decidedly disagree with him in his general apology for the\r\ndigging up of early writings which the writers may be presumed to wish\r\nkept dark. The alteration in the words of Iphigenia in the \"Dream of\r\nFair Women\" is not as good as it might be, and Mr. Bayne most justly\r\ncondemns \"the bright death,\" but it is quite clear that the lines as\r\nthey originally stood--\r\n\r\n  \"One drew a sharp knife through my tender throat\r\n      Slowly--and nothing more--\"\r\n\r\ndid not, grammatically considered, express the poet's meaning; and are\r\ncertainly open to ridicule on other grounds. The words, \"And _I knew_ no\r\nmore,\" _do_ express the meaning.\r\n\r\nThe alterations and additions in \"Maud\" appear to us to be about as bad\r\nas they could be. Explanatory additions were wanted, but not those flat\r\nprosaic lines, though Mr. Bayne appears to like them. On the other hand,\r\nthe verse--\r\n\r\n  \"I kissed her slender hand,\r\n    She took the kiss sedately,\r\n  Maud is not seventeen,\r\n    But she is tall and stately,\"\r\n\r\nwhich our intelligent critic does not like, appears to us perfect--in\r\nits place. Sweeter love-poetry than the finest parts of \"Maud\" is not to\r\nbe found in the language; the remark being confined to the more\r\nsuperficial kinds of love. For the \"tender passion\" of the poem is,\r\nafter all, superficial and thin: the strongest parts being the cynical.\r\nIt has always been a grief to us that so much exquisite poetry (Cantos\r\nXII., XVIII., XXII., in Part I; and IV. in Part II.) should have been\r\nframed in what is really nothing but a very poor \"sensation\" novel, with\r\na moral or lesson which is poorer still. Poetry is not bound to be\r\nunintermittingly poetic; there must be flat passages,--but such\r\nsecond-hand phrasing as \"a war in defence of the right\"--\"that an iron\r\ntyranny now should bend or cease\"--\"a cause that I felt to be pure and\r\ntrue\"--\"a giant liar\"--is intolerable in a poem of which the climax is\r\nso high-pitched. Better the merest conversational familiarity, than this\r\nrhetorical magniloquence.\r\n\r\nBefore passing from Tennyson's poems, we cannot help noting a curious\r\nexample of Dr. Bayne's tendency to excessive praise and admiration. In\r\nthat very poor poem, \"Sea-Dreams,\" the city clerk's wife induces her\r\nhusband to forgive the just-dead man who has robbed them of their\r\nsavings. Upon which Dr. Bayne remarks; \"There is not a nobler heroine in\r\nliterature than this wife of a city clerk, and I see no reason to\r\nbelieve that there are not many such to be found in London.\" Nor do\r\nwe--six women out of ten exhibit every week of their lives \"heroism\"\r\njust as \"noble.\" It is perfectly commonplace; and it is the critic's\r\nwarm-heartedness which betrays him into these extravagancies of\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe Essay on Ruskin has been nearly all rewritten, and it is a fine\r\nspecimen of studious candour, and something more. All we will add is,\r\nthat we hope Mr. Bayne holds, along with Mr. Ruskin--though it hardly\r\nlooks as if he did--that \"the destruction of beauty is a sacrilege and a\r\nsin.\" This is undoubtedly a fair account of what Mr. Ruskin means in\r\ncertain portions of his writings, and he is not the only one who has\r\nsuffered \"anguish,\" little short of despair, at certain \"works of\r\nprofanation.\" Mr. Bayne quotes Mr. Ruskin's passionate words about the\r\nbefouling and desecration of the \"pools and streams\" around Carshalton.\r\nNow, it would not be easy, perhaps, to prove that God made those \"pools\r\nand streams,\" still lovely in their degradation, in a sense in which he\r\ndid _not_ make the human beings who have \"insolently defiled\" them; but\r\nwe may at least say that the human will was concerned not only in the\r\n\"defiling\" but in the production of the defilers, while it was _not_\r\nconcerned in the production of those \"pools and streams.\" And we may\r\nconjecture that if Mr. Ruskin had been asked to decide whether the\r\n\"pools and streams\" should retain their original clearness and beauty,\r\nand the human beings remain unproduced, or whether the latter should\r\ncome into existence and the \"pools and streams\" be defiled--he would\r\nhave stood for the first alternative. But if he afterwards followed out\r\nhis decision to its consequence, it would make an end of what Mr. Bayne\r\nrightly calls the \"communistic\" element in his writings. It is painfully\r\ncertain that if Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth had been disgusted by \"people\r\nfrom Birthwaite\" before the \"Excursion\" was written, that poem would\r\nhave been very different here and there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. John Addington Symonds writes much, and he writes with absorbing\r\npains. When he called his new book _Sketches and Studies in Italy_\r\n(Smith, Elder, & Co.), had he forgotten a previous title of his,\r\n_Sketches in Italy and Greece_? In any case there is a wide difference\r\nbetween the two volumes; in the former we had more of the traveller, in\r\nthe latter we have more of the scholar, though the traveller is still\r\npresent; for instance, in the Essay, \"Amalfi, Pæstum, Capri,\" and in the\r\n\"Lombard Vignettes.\" In the Essay on the \"Orfeo\" of Poliziano, and that\r\non the \"Popular Italian Poetry of the Renaissance,\" we are again glad to\r\nrecognize the author's masterly power in certain kinds of translation;\r\nand those the kinds in which the labourers are few, though the harvest\r\nis so large. In about seventy pages, close pages it is true, Mr. Symonds\r\npresents us with a sketch of Florentine history, the like of which, for\r\ncompactness and minuteness of information, one knows not where to seek.\r\nMr. Symonds is a striking example of the modern school of\r\n\"culture\"--using that word in its more special sense. Unwearied in the\r\npursuit of detail, it occasionally tires the reader. There is a want of\r\nemphasis--not to say a shamefaced avoidance of it; there is the want of\r\ngrasp which comes of the absence of hearty controlling emotion, or of\r\nany purpose beyond what may belong to the monograph before you. There is\r\ntoo much colour, and too little motion--the reader would even be glad of\r\na jolt now and then; almost anything rather than this eternally grave\r\ngliding manner, in which the end is like the beginning, the beginning\r\nlike the middle, and the _quorsum hæc?_ seldom answered with anything\r\nlike energy. If we take an Essay like that on \"Lucretius,\" we become\r\nconscious, indeed, of an effort, but it seems rather an effort to lift a\r\nweight, than the effort of a living mind in free movement over a large\r\nsubject. Inevitably we have much that is true, very much of refinement\r\nand accomplishment, and of course a good aperçu now and then; but such\r\ninterest as there is appears a little forced, as if the author only\r\nhalf-believed in his own points, and too often endeavoured to give an\r\nair of breadth to literary stippling by mere largeness of phrase. These\r\nhints apply (in our opinion) with peculiar force to the paper on\r\n\"Lucretius;\" but they are not wholly inapplicable to that entitled\r\n\"Antinous,\" which does not fall far short of being tedious. But no\r\napology was necessary for reprinting the essays on blank verse, &c.,\r\nwhich are contained in the Appendix, though in those also there seems an\r\nexcessive tendency to make small \"points,\" and force large meanings on\r\ntrifles. The volume has a finely-executed steel engraving of the\r\nIldefonso group (Antinous) in the museum at Madrid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is nothing rude, we trust, in wondering aloud how many readers\r\nwill know quite off-hand, without glancing lower down, who wrote this\r\nexquisite little poem, though scarcely any one will read it without a\r\nsob, and none will ever forget it:--\r\n\r\n  \"My little son, who looked from thoughtful eyes,\r\n  And moved and spoke in quiet grown-up wise,\r\n  Having my law the seventh time disobey'd,\r\n  I struck him and dismiss'd\r\n  With hard words and unkiss'd,\r\n  His mother, who was patient, being dead.\r\n  Then, fearing lest his grief should hinder sleep,\r\n  I visited his bed,\r\n  But found him slumbering deep,\r\n  With darkened eyelids, and their lashes yet\r\n  From his late sobbing wet.\r\n  And I, with moan,\r\n  Kissing away his tears, left others of my own;\r\n  For, on a table drawn beside his head,\r\n  He had put, within his reach,\r\n  A box of counters and a red-veined stone,\r\n  A piece of glass abraded by the beach,\r\n  And six or seven shells,\r\n  A bottle with bluebells,\r\n  And two French copper coins ranged there with careful art,\r\n  To comfort his sad heart.\r\n  So, when that night I pray'd\r\n  To God, I wept and said:\r\n  Ah, when at last we lie with trancèd breath,\r\n  Not vexing Thee in death,\r\n  And Thou rememberest of what toys\r\n  We made our joys,\r\n  How weakly understood\r\n  Thy great commanded good,\r\n  Then, fatherly not less\r\n  Than I whom Thou hast moulded from the clay,\r\n  Thou'lt leave Thy wrath and say,\r\n  'I will be sorry for their childishness.'\"\r\n\r\nOnly we hope the number of those who can readily assign the poem to its\r\nauthor is after all, considerable: for it would be an ill omen if \"The\r\nAngel in the House,\" \"Faithful for Ever,\" the \"Unknown Eros,\" and their\r\ncompanion poems did not find a fairly large, as well as a choice public.\r\n\"The Unknown Eros, and other Odes,\" was published in 1877. Though it\r\ncontained the little poem we have just quoted, and a few others of the\r\nmost pellucid simplicity and the most homely sweetness, these were found\r\nin the company of \"odes\" in which the theme was as high-strung as the\r\ntitle, and a few in which the author's peculiarities were stretched to\r\nthe utmost. On the whole that volume could hardly be supposed to appeal\r\nto any but a few. Several years ago, there was a very cheap edition of\r\n\"Tamerton Church Tower,\" and most of the other poems (including the\r\n\"Angel in the House\"), and we should conjecture that it sold well--but\r\nit is now out of print, we are told. We have now, published by Messrs.\r\nGeorge Bell & Sons, a selection from Mr. Patmore's poems, made by Mr.\r\nRichard Garnett (himself a poet) and entitled _Florilegium Amantis_. It\r\nmakes 230 pages in a very handy little volume, and contains some of the\r\nmost exquisite things Mr. Patmore has printed; along with a few that are\r\nnew to us. We are not sure that we miss many of the very best (or\r\nbest-loved) pieces; but judging, as we are at the moment compelled to\r\ndo, from the earlier editions of the poems, we fancy there has been some\r\n\"cooking,\"--the sort of thing which an affectionate reader who gets his\r\npoet by heart always resents a little. The \"Wedding Sermon,\" as we have\r\nit here, looks like an extension of Dean Churchill's letter to Frederick\r\nin \"Faithful for Ever\"--though we note some changes in the old familiar\r\nlines. Some very charming touches are omitted in \"The Rosy Bosom'd\r\nHours;\" but we are not surprised, for we had them struck out once by an\r\neditor! The first four lines, about the curtained and locked \"coupé\" in\r\nthe train, were, we presume, looked upon as sure to set the hogs\r\nsnorting over any such touch as \"the isthmus of your waist.\" Some\r\nportions of \"The Victories of Love\" seem to have been worked into\r\n\"Amelia.\" The piece entitled \"Alexander and Lycon\" does not strike us as\r\nbeing good enough for its company. But certainly we know of no such\r\n\"lover's garland\" as this, and do not well see how there can be such\r\nanother. This must not be taken to imply that Mr. Patmore will seem to\r\nevery thoughtful reader consistent in his presentation of the ethics of\r\nhis topic. For example, Dean Churchill's Sermon will not hang together\r\nwith Mrs. Graham's beautiful letter to Frederick upon the difficulties\r\nof married life.\r\n\r\nIf there is any real defect in this nosegay, it is, perhaps, that we do\r\nnot see a little more of Lady Clitheroe, with her ever-delightful\r\nhumour. But perhaps Mr. Garnett--or Mr. Patmore, looking over his\r\nshoulder--remembered Mr. Shandy's advice to my Uncle Toby, to eschew\r\nmirth while paying his addresses to Widow Wadman. We, however, are under\r\nno restraint in this respect, and recommend everybody who takes up Mr.\r\nPatmore to make the most of Lady Clitheroe, and not to pass\r\nthoughtlessly over her most playful sayings; for they are usually quite\r\nas wise and good as the serious passage which we now extract from her\r\nletter to a newly-married couple:--\r\n\r\n  \"Age has romance almost as sweet,\r\n  And much more generous than this\r\n  Of your's and John's. With all the bliss\r\n  Of the evenings when you coo'd with him,\r\n  And upset home for your sole whim,\r\n  You might have envied, were you wise,\r\n  The tears within your mother's eyes\r\n  Which, I dare say you did not see.\r\n  But let that pass! Yours yet will be\r\n  I hope, as happy, kind, and true\r\n  As lives which now seem void to you.\r\n  Have you not seen shop-painters paste\r\n  Their gold in sheets, then rub to waste\r\n  Full half, and, lo, you read the name?\r\n  Well, Time, my dear, does much the same\r\n  With this unmeaning glare of love.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the last words of the book, and, having read them, the worst\r\nenemy of lovers' garlands will not accuse Mr. Patmore of \"putting stuff\r\nand nonsense into people's heads\" about love and marriage.\r\n\r\nTwo more slight but perhaps not uninteresting remarks. It may be from\r\nour ignorance, but we have never been able perfectly to enjoy the\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n  \"It was as if a harp _with wires_,\r\n  Was traversed by the breath I drew.\"\r\n\r\nThe force of the \"harp\" suggestion is plain, and it is good, but why \"a\r\nharp _with wires_?\" The other small matter is amusing. The piece in\r\npraise of England (p. 76), reproduced from \"Faithful for Ever,\" is dated\r\n1856, and this is the only date given in the volume. What does it mean?\r\nWe conjecture that Mr. Patmore has an almost savage wish to make it\r\nclear that since what he has elsewhere called \"the year of the great\r\ncrime, when the false English nobles, with their Jew, slew their trust,\"\r\nhe thinks this beautiful description has become inapplicable to his\r\ncountry:--\r\n\r\n  \"Remnant of Honour, brooding in the dark,\r\n  Over your bitter cark,\r\n  Staring, as Rizpah stared, astonied seven days,\r\n  Upon the corpses of so many sons\r\n  Who loved her once,\r\n  _Dead in the dim and lion-haunted ways_,\r\n  Who could have dreamt\r\n  That times should come like these?\"\r\n\r\nThose are a few of the bitter lines about England which abound in \"The\r\nUnknown Eros, and other Odes.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong books to possess--books to be bought, begged, or stolen, pleasant\r\nto look at, pleasant to dip into, and useful to refer to, we give a\r\nplace in the front rank to _Poems of Rural Life in the Dorset Dialect_,\r\nby William Barnes (C. Kegan Paul & Co.), and nobody will dispute this\r\naward. Many of these poems are familiar upon the tongue, or laid up\r\nsilent-sweet in the memory of hundreds of world-weary Cockneys, who\r\nnever set eyes on a Dorset vale, and probably never will. Mr. Barnes\r\nwrites a modest and characteristic preface explaining that two of these\r\nthree Collections of rural poems had long been out of print (we are glad\r\nto hear it), and also calling attention to the glossary at the end of\r\nthe volume, \"with some hints on Dorset word-shapes.\" Mr. Barnes is past\r\nreviewing, and we will only add that this complete collection (467\r\npages) forms a handsome and well-printed volume, and is altogether a\r\nthing to be delightedly thankful for.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTitles often prove misleading things, and it is not often that the\r\noutside of any book gives the faintest hint of its quality, unless it\r\ntells you, or nearly tells you, the publisher's name, for of course\r\nthere are publishers who very rarely issue bad, or even weak books.\r\n_Memories: a Life's Epilogue. New Edition. With a Lament for Princess\r\nAlice._ This is so very unpromising a title-page that if it had not been\r\nfor the names, Longmans, Green & Co. at the foot of it, we might well\r\nhave begun to turn over the leaves with some prejudice against the\r\nanonymous author. But a very casual glance informs the reader, in this\r\ncase, that he has to deal with a highly intelligent man of the old\r\nschool, with plenty of caustic humour in him. The author appears to be a\r\ngentleman advanced in years, and the \"Memoirs\" consist of recollections\r\nof incidents in his father's life and his own, going back at least as\r\nfar as the days of Cribb and Molyneux, and taking in some pleasant\r\nscenes of Continental travel. There is something exceedingly quaint,\r\nalmost ludicrous, in the author's way of employing the Spenserian\r\nstanza, and as it is not always clear that he is conscious of the humour\r\nthere is in it, the reader's attention is kept on the alert in the very\r\nlast way that would commend itself to a critic:--\r\n\r\n  \"The matron of the house obligingly\r\n    Led him to two large rooms on the first floor,\r\n  Where he would have more light and liberty,\r\n    With a good walk along the corridor;\r\n  Besides which, they expected one or more\r\n    Nice gentlemen to-morrow afternoon.\r\n  The gentleman who left the day before--\r\n    Poor man! he had a cough would kill him soon--\r\n    Ten months he had been with them on the twelfth of June.\"\r\n\r\nThis is certainly odd, and the puzzle is that though the author, as we\r\nhave said, has true and biting humour in him, he never drives his stanza\r\nwith the conscious _lilt_ that you find in, for example, Byron's use of\r\na substantially kindred measure in \"Beppo,\" or \"Morgante Maggiore.\" Take\r\nthe first lines that occur to one's mind in the latter:--\r\n\r\n  \"There being a want of water in the place,\r\n    Orlando, like a trusty brother, said,\r\n  Morgante, I could wish you in this case\r\n    To go for water. You shall be obeyed,\" &c.\r\n\r\nHere Byron is making the flat prose of the metre (so to speak), a source\r\nof humour in itself: but we cannot find that the author of these\r\n\"Memories\" intends anything of the kind. We agree with some of our\r\nbrethren in finding the occasional lyrics good, and the opening lines of\r\nthe seventh canto contain hints of genuine poetic quality. Altogether\r\nthe book is a noticeable budget of gossip in verse, with not a few\r\nstrong, pointed passages to relieve the effect of the flat or weak\r\npages; which latter are, to speak the truth, too numerous. We should\r\nguess the author to be a very \"clubable man.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is a very pleasant title, at all events, _A Nook in the Appennines,\r\nor a Summer Beneath the Chestnuts_, by Leader Scott, author of \"The\r\nPainter's Ordeal,\" &c., &c. With twenty-seven Illustrations, chiefly\r\nfrom Original Sketches (C. Kegan Paul & Co.), and the book is pleasant\r\ntoo. Finding the heat at Florence, on the 11th of June--not _last_\r\nJune--too much for them, it being 96° in the shade, an English family\r\nflee to a nook in the mountains, where an old villa has been got ready\r\nfor them; and there they sit, \"at the receipt of coolness,\" like Lamb's\r\n\"gentle giantess,\" till September. The villa on the Apennines is 2220\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, and the thermometer stands only at 70°\r\nin the open air. Now 70° is ordinary agreeable summer heat for England;\r\nthough it is many degrees higher than anything we have seen (up to the\r\nmiddle of July) in England this dreadful year. The illustrations are\r\nhelpful, and, without being obtrusively antiquarian, have most of them a\r\nretrospective or historical interest, as well as the more obvious one\r\nwhich is common to illustrations. The forty short chapters of which the\r\nbook consists are filled with sketches of the life our English friends\r\nlived in the mountain nook, and of the manners and daily lives of the\r\npeasantry by whom they were surrounded--and these will be more\r\ninstructive to a reader who knows a little about the Etruscans than to\r\none who knows nothing of them. The interest of the narrative is never\r\nstrong, but it is strong enough to carry the attention equably forward\r\nto the end, and there is no affectation; but it is a great mistake, and\r\nan unkindness to the reader, to omit, in a case of this sort, giving a\r\nsufficiently full, complete, and picturesque account of the travelling\r\nparty themselves. We ought to be told how many there were, their ages,\r\nrelationships, &c., and something of their previous travelling\r\nexperience, if any.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf course it is a good thing when a first-rate French, German, or\r\nScandinavian novel is translated into English, and this is pretty sure\r\nto happen, when it does happen, through the agency of high-class\r\npublishers. But it is a very different thing when translations of\r\nforeign novels are thrown at our heads by the score, by writers or\r\npublishers whose chief object is to pander to certain questionable\r\ntastes. We fear that this evil is upon us, or not far off. But a word of\r\npleasant, if qualified, welcome is due to _A Distinguished Man: a\r\nHumorous Romance_, by A. Von Winterfeld, translated by W. Laird-Clowes,\r\n(C. Kegan Paul & Co. 3 vols.). The chief thing to _qualify_ the welcome\r\nis the fact that the author is too fond of hinting at the skeleton in\r\nthe cupboard of what people call \"modern thought.\" But apart from this,\r\nthe book is amusing, and often more than amusing. It belongs to a type\r\nwhich is very rare in English literature--a sort of child-like farce,\r\nthat is exceedingly difficult to describe; but it must be a very\r\nsaturnine reader that can help a good laugh at some of the wild\r\nadventures of the German schoolmaster and German doctor upon English\r\nground. These two men are rivals in love, and have both sought the hand\r\nof a German butcher's daughter. In the fulfilment of a certain ordeal,\r\nor test, which he imposes, they have to travel by way of Ostend to\r\nLondon, and thence to Edinburgh; the one who is first at certain marked\r\npoints in a given route, to be the winner of the fair prize. Make up\r\nyour mind that you are going to read some nonsense, and you will enjoy\r\nthe book.
