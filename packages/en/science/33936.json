ANGELL]\r\n\r\n_The University of Chicago_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to accept the invitation of the publishers to\r\nwrite a word of introduction for Mr. Rahn's excellent translation of\r\n\"Der Kluge Hans\", a book which in the original has been but little known\r\nto American readers. The present wave of interest in animal life and\r\nbehavior renders its appearance peculiarly appropriate.\r\n\r\nNo more remarkable tale of credulity founded on unconscious deceit was\r\never told, and were it offered as fiction, it would take high rank as a\r\nwork of imagination. Being in reality a record of sober fact, it verges\r\non the miraculous. After reading Mr. Pfungst's story one can quite\r\nunderstand how sedate and sober Germany was for months thrown into a\r\nturmoil of newspaper debate, which for intensity and range of feeling\r\nfinds its only parallel in a heated political campaign. That the subject\r\nof the controversy was the alleged ability of a trained horse to solve\r\ncomplex arithmetical problems may excite gaiety and even derision, until\r\none hears the details. Scientists and scholars of the highest eminence\r\nwere drawn into the conflict, which has not yet wholly subsided,\r\nalthough the present report must be regarded as quite final in its\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\nAs for Hans himself, he has become the prototype of a host of less\r\ndistinguished imitators representing every level of animal life, and\r\nwhen last heard from he was still entertaining mystified audiences by\r\nhis accomplishments.\r\n\r\nBut the permanent worth of the book is not to be found in its record of\r\npopular excitement, interesting as that is. It is a document of the very\r\nfirst consequence in its revelation of the workings of the animal mind\r\nas disclosed in the horse. Animal lovers of all kinds, whether\r\nscientists or laymen, will find in it material of greatest value for the\r\ncorrect apprehension of animal behavior. Moreover, it affords an\r\nilluminating insight into the technique of experimental psychology in\r\nits study both of human and animal consciousness. Finally, it contains a\r\nnumber of highly suggestive observations bearing on certain aspects of\r\ntelepathy and muscle-reading. All things considered, it may fairly be\r\nsaid that few scientific books appeal to so various a range of interests\r\nin so vital a way.\r\n\r\nReaders who wish to inform themselves of all the personal circumstances\r\nin the case may best read the text just as it stands. Those who desire\r\nto get at the pith of the matter without reference to its historical\r\nsettings, may be advised to omit the Introduction by Professor Stumpf of\r\nthe University of Berlin, together with supplements II, III and IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           PAGE\r\n  PREFATORY NOTE (By JAMES R.

STUMPF]\r\n\r\n\r\nA horse that solves correctly problems in multiplication and division by\r\nmeans of tapping. Persons of unimpeachable honor, who in the master's\r\nabsence have received responses, and assure us that in the process they\r\nhave not made even the slightest sign. Thousands of spectators,\r\nhorse-fanciers, trick-trainers of first rank, and not one of them during\r\nthe course of many months' observations are able to discover any kind of\r\nregular signal.\r\n\r\nThat was the riddle. And its solution was found in the unintentional\r\nminimal movements of the horse's questioner.\r\n\r\nSimple though it may seem, the history of the solution is nevertheless\r\nquite complex, and one of the important incidents in it is the\r\nappearance of the zooelogist and African traveler, Schillings, upon the\r\nscene, and then there is the report of the so-called Hans-Commission of\r\nSeptember 12, 1904. And finally there is the scientific investigation,\r\nthe results of which were published in my report of December 9, 1904.\r\n\r\nAfter a cursory inspection during the month of February, I again called\r\nupon Mr. von Osten in July, and asked him to explain to Professor\r\nSchumann and me just what method he had used in instructing the horse.\r\nWe hoped in this way to gain a clue to the mechanism of Hans's feats.\r\nThe most essential parts of the information thus gleaned are summarized\r\nin Supplement I. Mr. Schillings came into the courtyard for the first\r\ntime about the middle of July. He came as skeptical as everyone else.\r\nBut after he, himself, had received correct responses, he too became\r\nconvinced, and devoted much of his time to exhibiting the horse, and\r\ndaily brought new guests. To be perfectly frank, at the time this seemed\r\nto us a disturbing factor in the investigation, but now we see that his\r\nintervention was a link in the chain of events which finally led to an\r\nexplanation. For it was through him that the fact was established beyond\r\ncavil, that the horse was able to respond to strangers in the master's\r\nabsence. Heretofore, this had been noted only in isolated cases. Since\r\nit could not be assumed that a well-known investigator should take it\r\nupon himself to mislead the public by intentionally giving signs, the\r\ncase necessarily from that time on appeared in the eyes of others in a\r\nlight quite different from that in which ordinary circus-tricks would\r\nappear, to which it bore such a striking external resemblance. No matter\r\nhow this state of affairs may have arisen in the course of years, no\r\nmatter how it might eventually be explained,--the quality of the\r\nextraordinary would necessarily attach itself to this particular case,\r\nas it did.\r\n\r\nOf course, to many persons in the interested public the result was\r\nmerely that Schillings, also, was placed in the category of deceivers.\r\nOn the other hand there were reputable scientists who could not dispose\r\nof the matter in that fashion, and these now openly took their stand\r\nwith Schillings and declared that they believed in the horse's ability\r\nto think. Zooelogists especially, saw in von Osten's results evidence of\r\nthe essential similarity between the human and the animal mind, which\r\ndoctrine has been coming more and more into favor since the time of\r\nDarwin. Educators were disposed to be convinced, on account of the\r\nclever systematic method of instruction which had been used and which\r\nhad not, till then, been applied in the education of a horse. In\r\naddition, there were many details which, it seemed, could not be\r\nexplained in any other way. So far as I myself was concerned, I was\r\nready to change my views with regard to the nature of animal\r\nconsciousness, as soon as a careful examination would show that nothing\r\nelse would explain the facts, except the assumption of the presence of\r\nconceptual thinking. I had thought out the process hypothetically, i. e.,\r\nhow one might conceive of the rise of number concepts and arithmetical\r\ncalculation along the peculiar lines which had been followed in Hans's\r\neducation, and on the basis of the assumption that the beginnings of\r\nconceptual thinking are present in animals. Also, I had too much faith\r\nin human nature to fear lest nothing peculiarly human should remain\r\nafter the art of handling numbers should be shown to be common property\r\nwith the lower forms. But under no circumstances would I have undertaken\r\nto make a public statement in favor of any particular view in this\r\nextraordinary case, before a thorough investigation, in accordance with\r\nscientific principles, had been made. I expressed this sentiment at the\r\ntime, and recommended the appointment of an investigating commission (in\r\nthe \"Tag\" of September 3, 1904).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this commission was misunderstood, and therefore many\r\nwere disappointed with the report which it published, (Supplement II).\r\nSome had been expecting a positive conclusive explanation; the\r\ncommission recommended further investigation. Some had asked for a\r\nsolution of the question whether or not the horse was able to think; the\r\ncommission maintained neither the one, nor the other. Some had indicated\r\nas the main condition of a satisfactory investigation, that both Mr. von\r\nOsten and Mr. Schillings be excluded from the tests; this was not done.\r\n\r\nBut the commission--which, by the way, did not give itself this name,\r\nsince it had been delegated by no one--undoubtedly had the right to\r\nformulate its problem as it saw fit, and this was carefully expressed at\r\nthe beginning of its report as follows: \"The undersigned came together\r\nfor the purpose of investigating the question whether or not there is\r\ninvolved in the feats of the horse of Mr. von Osten anything of the\r\nnature of tricks, that is, intentional influence or aid on the part of\r\nthe questioner.\" It was this preliminary question, and not whether or\r\nnot the horse could think, which the commission intended to answer. They\r\nproposed to act as a sort of court of honor for the two gentlemen who\r\nhad been attacked. It is only in this light that even the _raison\r\nd'etre_ of this body can be understood; for a scientific commission\r\ncomposed of thirteen men, possessed of varying degrees of scientific\r\npreparation, would have been an absurd travesty, and it will readily be\r\nseen why the two men, who had been attacked, should not be excluded,\r\nsince it was they, and primarily Mr. von Osten, upon whom the\r\nobservations were to be made.\r\n\r\nTo be sure the commission did go one step beyond that which it had\r\nproposed to itself, since it added that it believed that unintentional\r\nsigns of the kind which are at present familiar, were also excluded.\r\nThis led many to the unwarranted conclusion that the commission had\r\ndeclared that Hans was able to think. Whereas the thing which might have\r\nbeen logically suggested was that instead of the assumption of the\r\npresence of independent thinking, the commission may have had in mind\r\nunintentional signs of a kind hitherto unknown. I explained this to a\r\nreporter of the \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" (Mr. A. Gold), who had come to me\r\nfor information, and in his article he made this hypothesis appear as\r\nthe most probable one.[A] Certain statements of the circus-manager\r\nBusch, who speaks of a 'connection' of some sort, go to show that other\r\nmembers of the commission held to the view just stated.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote A: \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" of September 22, 1904:\r\n    \"Concerning the question whether the horse was given some sort of\r\n    aid, Professor Stumpf expressed himself freely. He said: 'We were\r\n    careful to state in our report that the intentional use of the\r\n    (actual) means of training, on the part of the horse's teacher, is\r\n    out of the question, ... nor are there involved any of the known\r\n    kinds of unconscious, involuntary aids. Our task was completed after\r\n    we had ascertained that no tricks or aids of the traditional sort\r\n    were being employed'.\" After some remarks on unconscious habituation\r\n    and self-training on the part of animals, the writer arrives at the\r\n    conclusion that \"the horse of Mr. von Osten has been educated by its\r\n    master in the most round-about way, in accordance with a method\r\n    suited for the development of human reasoning powers, hence in all\r\n    good faith, to give correct responses by means of tapping with the\r\n    foot. But what the horse really learned by this wearisome process\r\n    was something quite different, something that was more in accord\r\n    with his natural capacities,--he learned to discover by purely\r\n    sensory aids which are so near the threshold that they are\r\n    imperceptible for us and even for the teacher, when he is expected\r\n    to tap with his foot and when he is to come to rest.\"]\r\n\r\nBut how did it come to pass that the commission should deny completely\r\nthe presence of intentional signals, while, as regards the unintended,\r\nit excluded only those which were of the known sort? The report clearly\r\nshows that the decision as to the absence of voluntary signals was\r\nbased not merely upon the fact that no such signals had been detected by\r\nthe most expert observers, but also upon the character of the two men\r\nwho exhibited the horse, upon their behavior during the entire period,\r\nand upon the method of instruction which Mr. von Osten had employed. In\r\nthe case of unintentional signs, on the other hand, one had to deal with\r\nthe fact with which physiologists and experimental psychologists are\r\nespecially familiar, viz., that our conscious states, without our\r\nwilling it--indeed, even in spite of us--are accompanied by bodily\r\nchanges which very often can be detected only by the use of extremely\r\nfine graphic methods. The following is a more general instance: every\r\nmother, who detects the lie or divines the wish in the eyes of the\r\nchild, knows that there are characteristic changes of facial expression,\r\nwhich are, nevertheless, very difficult of definition.[B]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote B: \"From the productions of the 'thought-readers' we see\r\n    how slight and seemingly insignificant the unconscious movements may\r\n    be, which serve as signs for a sensitive re-agent. But in this case\r\n    no contact is necessary. There would have to be some sort of visible\r\n    or audible expression on the part of the questioner. No proof for\r\n    this has as yet been advanced.\"\r\n\r\n    How any one possessing the power of logical thought could possibly\r\n    infer from these words of mine (published in the above-mentioned\r\n    article in the \"Tag\"), that I denied the possibility of the\r\n    occurrence of visual signs, is to me incomprehensible. What I did\r\n    deny, and still deny, is that up to that time any had been proven to\r\n    occur.]\r\n\r\nThe commission did not even maintain or believe that unintentional signs\r\nwithin the realm of the senses known to us, were to be excluded.\r\nProfessor Nagel and I would never have subscribed to any such\r\nconclusion. The sentence in question, therefore, could only be\r\ninterpreted as follows: that signals of the kind that are used\r\nintentionally in the training of horses, could not have occurred even\r\nas unintended signs, for otherwise Mr. Busch would have detected them.\r\nAnd in order to be observed by him it was immaterial whether they were\r\ngiven purposely or not. The same signs, therefore, which as a result of\r\nhis observations were declared not to be present, could not be assumed\r\nto be involved as unintentional.\r\n\r\nFor my part I am ready to confess that at this time I did not expect to\r\nfind the involuntary signals, if any such were involved, in the form of\r\nmovements. I had in mind rather some sort of nasal whisper such as had\r\nbeen invoked by the Danish psychologist A. Lehmann, in order to explain\r\ncertain cases of so-called telepathy. I could not believe that a horse\r\ncould perceive movements which escaped the sharp eyes of the\r\ncircus-manager. To be sure, extremely slight movements may still be\r\nperceived after objects at rest have become imperceptible. But one would\r\nhardly expect this feat on the part of an animal, who was so deficient\r\nin keenness of vision, as we have been led, by those of presumably\r\nexpert knowledge, to believe of the horse,--one would expect it all the\r\nless because Mr. von Osten and Mr. Schillings would move hither and\r\nthither in most irregular fashion while the horse was going through his\r\ntapping, and would therefore make the perception of minute movements all\r\nthe more difficult.\r\n\r\nNor was there anything in the exhibitions given at the same time in a\r\nBerlin vaudeville by the mare \"Rosa,\" which might have shattered this\r\nbelief. For, in the case of this rival of Hans, the movements involved\r\nwere comparatively coarse. The closing signal consisted in bending\r\nforward on the part of the one exhibiting the mare, while up to that\r\npoint he had stood bolt upright. Most persons were not aware of this,\r\nbecause this change in posture cannot be noticed from the front. I\r\nhappened to sit to the side and caught the movement every time. It was\r\nthe same that was noted by Dr. Miessner, another member of the\r\ncommission, (see page 256), but concerning which he did not give me a\r\nmore complete account. Later I learned through Professor Th. W.\r\nEngelmann that the very same movement was employed not long ago, for\r\ngiving signals to a dog exhibited at Utrecht. This particular movement\r\nis very well adapted to commercial purposes, since the spectator always\r\ntries to view the performance from a point as nearly in front of the\r\nanimal and its master as possible, thus making the detection of the\r\ntrick all the more difficult.\r\n\r\nThe details of the various experiments made by this commission are given\r\nin an excerpt from the records kept by Dr. von Hornbostel, which I\r\nshowed to a small group of persons a few days after the 12th of\r\nSeptember (Supplement III). At that time none of the particulars was\r\npublished, because the commission wished to wait until some positive\r\nstatement might be made. The public was merely to be assured that a\r\ngroup of reputable men, from different spheres of life, who could have\r\nno purpose in hazarding their reputation, believed that the case was one\r\nworthy of careful investigation.\r\n\r\nI left Berlin on September 17th and did not return until October 3d. In\r\nthe meantime Mr. Schillings continued the investigation, and was\r\nassisted in part by Mr. Oskar Pfungst, one of my co-workers at the\r\nPsychological Institute. For the first time a number of tests were now\r\nmade in which neither the questioner, nor any of those present knew the\r\nanswer to the problem. Such tests naturally were the first steps toward\r\na positive investigation. The results were such that Mr. Schillings was\r\nled to replace his hypothesis of independent conceptual thinking by one\r\nof some kind of suggestion. In this he was strengthened somewhat by\r\nhaving noted the fact that in his questions which he put to the horse,\r\nhe might proceed as far as to ask the impossible. He has always been\r\nready to offer himself in the tests which have been undertaken since\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nOn October 13, 1904, together with the two gentlemen mentioned in the\r\nbeginning of my report, I began my more detailed investigation, and\r\nfinished on November 29. We worked for several hours on the average of\r\nfour times each week. I take this opportunity of giving expression of\r\nthe recognition which is due to the two gentlemen. They were ready to go\r\nto the courtyard in all kinds of weather, at times they went without me,\r\nand they always patiently discussed the order and method of the\r\nexperiments and the results. Dr. von Hornbostel had the important task\r\nof keeping the records, and Mr. Pfungst undertook the conduct of the\r\nexperiments. It was he, who, soon after the blinder-tests disclosed the\r\nnecessary presence of visual signs, discovered the nature of these\r\nsigns. Without him we might have shown the horse to be dependent upon\r\nvisual stimuli in general, but we never would have been able to gain\r\nthat mass of detail, which makes the case valuable for human psychology.\r\nBut I am tempted to praise not merely his patience and skill, but also\r\nhis courage. For we must not believe that Mr. von Osten's horse was a\r\n\"perfectly gentle\" animal. If he stood untied and happened to be excited\r\nby some sudden occurrence, he would make that courtyard an unsafe place,\r\nand both Mr. Schillings and Mr. Pfungst suffered from more than one\r\nbite. In this connection I would also express my obligations to Count\r\nOtto zu Castell-Ruedenhausen, for his frequent intercession on our behalf\r\nwith the owner of the horse, and for his many evidences of good-will and\r\nhelpfulness.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of this report (Supplement IV), there was still\r\nsome further discussion of the case in societies of various kinds and in\r\nthe press, but no important objections were raised. A hippologist\r\nthought that men of his calling should have been consulted, a\r\ntelepathist believed that telepathists should have been called in. There\r\nwas also some further talk of suggestion, will-transference,\r\nthought-reading and the occult, but no attempt was made to elucidate\r\nthese vague terms with reference to their application to the case in\r\nhand. Others adhered to the old cry of \"fraud,\" for a share of which Mr.\r\nPfungst now fell heir. There were a few who felt it incumbent upon\r\nthemselves to preserve their 'priority,' and therefore stated with a\r\nshow of satisfaction that I had finally 'confessed' myself to hold their\r\nrespective points of view. As if there were anything like \"confessions\"\r\nin science! As if mere affirmations, even though sealed and deposited in\r\ntreasure vaults, had any value with reference to a case in which every\r\nmanner of supposition had been advanced in lieu of explanation. Why did\r\nthey wait so long, if they had convincing proof for their position?\r\n\r\nAnd finally there were disappointed Darwinists who expressed fear lest\r\necclesiastical and reactionary points of view should derive favorable\r\nmaterial from the conclusions arrived at in my report. Needless fear.\r\nFor lovers of truth it must always remain a matter of inconsequence\r\nwhether anyone is pleased or displeased with the truth, and whether it\r\nis enunciated by Aristotle or Haeckel.\r\n\r\nMr. von Osten, however, continued to exhibit Hans, and is probably doing\r\nso still, but in what frame of mind, I dare not judge. The spectators\r\ncontinue to look on, they are doubly alert to catch movements, and many\r\nof them have learned from Mr. Schillings what kind of movements they are\r\nto expect. But these \"initiated\" ones regularly return and declare that\r\nthere is nothing in the movements and that they simply could not\r\ndiscover any aids given to the horse. Nothing can so well show how\r\ndifficult the case is, and how great the need of a thorough exposition\r\nof the whole matter, than the account given in the following pages of\r\nMr. Pfungst. Its publication has been delayed on account of the\r\nadditional tests made in the laboratory, but we have reason to suppose\r\nthat through these additional tests the work has gained in permanent\r\nvalue. Experimental psychologists will perhaps be greatly interested in\r\nthe graphic registration of the minute involuntary movements which\r\naccompany the thought process, and in the artificial association of a\r\ngiven involuntary movement with a given idea. Likewise the tests on\r\nsense-perception in horses, which have led to essential changes in\r\nhitherto current views, and the critical review of the comprehensive\r\nliterature on similar achievements of other animals, will be welcomed by\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nBefore closing these introductory remarks, I would make one more\r\nstatement concerning Mr. von Osten. The reader will notice that the\r\njudgment passed upon him in this treatise is placed at the end, whereas\r\nin the report of the commission it came first. This was brought about by\r\nthe change that was made in the way of stating the problem. Then the\r\nquestion discussed was whether 'tricks' were involved; now the question\r\nis: What is the mechanism of the process? The question of the good faith\r\nof the master was taken up once more only because the facts that were\r\nbrought to light by the later experimentation seemingly brought forward\r\nnew grounds for distrust. But by placing this discussion toward the end\r\nof our report we wished to indicate that everything that is said of the\r\npresent status of facts, is quite independent of the view taken\r\nconcerning Mr. von Osten. Even assuming that the horse had been\r\npurposely trained by him to respond to this kind of signal, the case\r\nwould still deserve a place in the annals of science. For visual signs,\r\nplanned and practiced so that they could not only be more readily\r\nperceived by the animal than by man, but could be transferred from their\r\ninventor to others without any betrayal of the secret,--this would be an\r\nextraordinary invention, and Mr. von Osten would then be a fraud, but\r\nalso a genius of first rank.\r\n\r\nIn truth he probably was neither, but I was brief in my report, for\r\notherwise I would have been obliged to go into more detail than the case\r\nwarranted. And a judgment passed upon a human personality is quite a\r\ndifferent matter from a judgment upon a horse. If it is unscientific to\r\nmake unqualified statements concerning a horse after the performance of\r\nonly a few experimental tests, it is certainly an unwarranted thing to\r\npass a moral judgment upon a man upon the basis of meagre material.\r\nAnyone who would assume the role of judge should bear in mind that here\r\ntoo we have more than a hundredfold the material which they could bring\r\nforward, and among it some which, if taken alone, would be more\r\nunfavorable than any that they had. But here all things should be\r\nweighed together, and not in isolation. A former instructor of\r\nmathematics in a German gymnasium, a passionate horseman and hunter,\r\nextremely patient and at the same time highly irrascible, liberal in\r\npermitting the use of the horse for days at a time and again tyrannical\r\nin the insistence upon foolish conditions, clever in his method of\r\ninstruction and yet at the same time possessing not even the slightest\r\nnotion of the most elementary conditions of scientific procedure,--all\r\nthis, and more, goes to make up the man. He is fanatic in his\r\nconviction, he has an eccentric mind which is crammed full of theories\r\nfrom the phrenology of Gall to the belief that the horse is capable of\r\ninner speech and thereby enunciates inwardly the number as it proceeds\r\nwith the tapping. From theories such as these, and on the basis of all\r\nsorts of imagined emotional tendencies in the horse, he also managed to\r\nformulate an explanation for the failure of the tests in which none of\r\nthe persons present knew the answer to the problem given the horse, and\r\nalso for the failure of those tests in which the large blinders were\r\napplied. And he would often interfere with or hinder other tests which,\r\naccording to his point of view, were likely to lead us astray. And yet,\r\nwhen the first tests with the blinders did turn out as unmistakably\r\nsheer failures, there was such genuine surprise, such tragi-comic rage\r\ndirected against the horse, that we finally believed that his views in\r\nthe matter would be changed beyond a doubt. \"The gentlemen must admit,\"\r\nhe said at the time, \"that after seeing the objective success of my\r\nefforts at instruction, I was warranted in my belief in the horse's\r\npower of independent thought.\" Nevertheless, upon the following day he\r\nwas as ardent an exponent of the belief in the horse's intelligence as\r\nhe ever had been.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, after I could no longer keep from him the results of our\r\ninvestigation, I received a letter from him in which he forbade further\r\nexperimentation with the horse. The purpose of our inquiries, he said,\r\nhad been to corroborate his theories. On account of his withdrawal of\r\nthe horse a few experimental series unfortunately could not be\r\ncompleted, but happily the major portion of our task had been\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE OF MR. VON OSTEN\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF ANIMAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND \"CLEVER HANS\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we would appreciate the interest that has been aroused everywhere by\r\nthe wonderful horse solving arithmetical problems, we must first\r\nconsider briefly the present state of the problem of animal\r\nconsciousness.[C] Animal consciousness cannot be directly gotten at, and\r\nthe psychologist must therefore seek to appreciate it on the basis of\r\nthe animal's behavior and with the assistance of conceptions borrowed\r\nfrom human psychology. Hence it is that animal psychology rests upon\r\nuncertain foundations with the result that the fundamental principles\r\nhave been repeatedly questioned and agreement has not yet been attained.\r\nThe most important of these questions is, \"Does the animal possess\r\nconsciousness, and is it like the human consciousness?\" Comparative\r\npsychologists divide into three groups on this question.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote C: Since the present treatise is intended for the larger\r\n    public, this brief resume will probably be welcome to many.]\r\n\r\nThe one group allows consciousness to the lower forms, but emphasizes\r\nthe assertion that between the animal and the human consciousness there\r\nis an impassable gap. The animal may have sensations and memory-images\r\nof sensations which may become associated in manifold combinations. Both\r\nsensations and memory images are believed to be accompanied by\r\nconditions of pleasure and of pain (so-called sensuous feelings), and\r\nthese in turn, become the mainsprings of desire. The possession of\r\nmemory gives the power of learning through experience. But with this,\r\nthe inventory of the content of animal consciousness is exhausted. The\r\nability to form concepts[D] and with their aid to make judgments and\r\ndraw conclusions is denied the lower forms. All the higher intellectual,\r\naesthetic and moral feelings, as well as volition guided by motives, are\r\nalso denied. Among the ancients this view was held by Aristotle and the\r\nStoics; and following them it was taught by the Christian Church. It\r\npervaded all mediaeval philosophy, which grew out of the teachings of\r\nAristotle and the Church. It is this philosophy, in the form of\r\nNeo-Thomism, which still obtains in the Catholic world.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote D: Ideas are copies of former sensations, feelings and\r\n    other psychic experiences and retain also the accidental signs which\r\n    belonged to those earlier experiences. They are images in the\r\n    concrete, such as the memory of a certain horse in a certain\r\n    definite situation ... say a well fed, long-tailed one standing at a\r\n    manger. A concept, on the other hand, is a mental construct which\r\n    has its rise in ideas, or memory-images, in that their essential\r\n    characteristics are abstracted. For this reason the concept has not\r\n    a definite image-content. (Thus the thought of \"horse\" in general,\r\n    is a concept. Not so the thought of a certain individual\r\n    horse,----that is an idea, with a definite image-content.)]\r\n\r\nDuring the 17th century, even though temporarily, another conception of\r\nthe consciousness of lower forms came to prevail and was introduced by\r\nDescartes, the \"Father\" of modern philosophy. Far more radical than the\r\nearlier conception, it denied to animals not only the power of abstract\r\nthought, but every form of psychic life whatever, and reduced the lower\r\nform to a machine, which automatically reacted upon external stimuli.\r\nThis daring view, however, prevailed for only a comparatively short\r\nperiod; but owing to the opposition which it aroused, it gave a\r\ntremendous impetus to the study of animal consciousness. Most of the\r\ngreat philosophers following Descartes, such as Locke, Leibniz, Kant,\r\nand Schopenhauer, however greatly they may have differed in other\r\npoints, in this one returned to the Aristotelian point of view.\r\n\r\nA third belief avers that animal and human consciousness do not differ\r\nin essentials, but only in degree. This conclusion is regularly arrived\r\nat by those who regard so-called abstract thought itself, as simply a\r\nplay of individual sensations and sensation-images, as did the French\r\nand British associationists (Condillac and the Mills). The superiority\r\nof man accordingly consisted in his ability to form more intricate\r\nideational complexes. Again, this conception of the essential similarity\r\nof the human and the animal psyche has also always been arrived at by\r\nthe materialists (from Epicurus to C. Vogt and Buechner) who impute\r\nreason to the animal form as well as to man. The same position is,\r\nfurthermore, taken by the evolutionists, including those who do not\r\nsubscribe to the doctrines of materialism. It has almost become dogma\r\nwith them that there exists an unbroken chain of psychic life from the\r\nlowest protozoa to man. Haeckel, preeminently, though not always\r\nconvincingly, sought to establish such a graded series and thus to\r\nbridge the chasm between the human and the animal consciousness.\r\n\r\nTwo tendencies, therefore, are discernible in animal psychology. The\r\none seeks to remove the animal psyche farther away from the human, the\r\nother tries to bring the two closer together. It is undoubtedly true\r\nthat many acts of the lower forms reveal nothing of the nature of\r\nconceptual thinking. But that others might thus be interpreted cannot be\r\ndenied. But need they be thus interpreted?--There lies the dispute. A\r\nsingle incontrovertible fact which would fulfil this demand, [i.e.,\r\nproof of conceptual thinking], would, at a stroke, decide the question\r\nin favor of those who ascribe the power of thought to the lower forms.\r\n\r\nAt last the thing so long sought for, was apparently found: A horse that\r\ncould solve arithmetical problems--an animal which, thanks to long\r\ntraining, mastered not merely rudiments, but seemingly arrived at a\r\npower of abstract thought and which surpassed, by far, the highest\r\nexpectations of the greatest enthusiast.\r\n\r\nAnd now what was it that this wonderful horse could do? The reader may\r\naccompany us to an exhibition which was given daily before a select\r\ncompany at about the noon hour in a paved courtyard surrounded by high\r\napartment houses in the northern part of Berlin. No fee was ever taken.\r\nThe visitor might walk about freely and if he wished, might closely\r\napproach the horse and its master, a man between sixty and seventy years\r\nof age. His white head was covered with a black, slouch hat. To his left\r\nthe stately animal, a Russian trotting horse, stood like a docile pupil,\r\nmanaged not by means of the whip, but by gentle encouragement and\r\nfrequent reward of bread or carrots. He would answer correctly, nearly\r\nall of the questions which were put to him in German. If he understood a\r\nquestion, he immediately indicated this by a nod of the head; if he\r\nfailed to grasp its import, he communicated the fact by a shake of the\r\nhead. We were told that the questioner had to confine himself to a\r\ncertain vocabulary, but this was comparatively rich and the horse\r\nwidened its scope daily without special instruction, but by simple\r\ncontact with his environment. His master, to be sure, was usually\r\npresent whenever questions were put to the horse by others, but in the\r\ncourse of time, he gradually responded to a greater and greater number\r\nof persons. Even though Hans did not appear as willing and reliable in\r\nthe case of strangers as in the case of his own master, this might\r\neasily be explained by the lack of authoritativeness on their part and\r\nof affection on the part of Hans, who for the last four years had had\r\nintercourse only with his master.\r\n\r\nOur intelligent horse was unable to speak, to be sure. His chief mode of\r\nexpression was tapping with his right forefoot. A good deal was also\r\nexpressed by means of movements of the head. Thus \"yes\" was expressed by\r\na nod, \"no\" by a deliberate movement from side to side; and \"upward,\"\r\n\"upper,\" \"downward,\" \"right,\" \"left,\" were indicated by turning the head\r\nin these directions. In this he showed an astonishing ability to put\r\nhimself in the place of his visitors. Upon being asked which arm was\r\nraised by a certain gentleman opposite him, Hans promptly answered by a\r\nmovement to the right, even though seen from his own side, it would\r\nappear to be the left. Hans would also walk toward the persons or things\r\nthat he was asked to point out, and he would bring from a row of colored\r\ncloths, the piece of the particular color demanded. Taking into account\r\nhis limited means of expression, his master had translated a large\r\nnumber of concepts into numbers; e. g.:--the letters of the alphabet,\r\nthe tones of the scale, and the names of the playing cards were\r\nindicated by taps. In the case of playing cards one tap meant \"ace,\" two\r\ntaps \"king,\" three \"queen,\" etc.\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to some of his specific accomplishments. He had,\r\napparently, completely mastered the cardinal numbers from 1 to 100 and\r\nthe ordinals to 10, at least. Upon request he would count objects of all\r\nsorts, the persons present, even to distinctions of sex. Then hats,\r\numbrellas, and eyeglasses. Even the mechanical activity of tapping\r\nseemed to reveal a measure of intelligence. Small numbers were given\r\nwith a slow tapping of the right foot. With larger numbers he would\r\nincrease his speed, and would often tap very rapidly right from the\r\nstart, so that one might have gained the impression that knowing that he\r\nhad a large number to tap, he desired to hasten the monotonous activity.\r\nAfter the final tap, he would return his right foot--which he used in\r\nhis counting--to its original position, or he would make the final count\r\nwith a very energetic tap of the left foot,--to underscore it, as it\r\nwere. \"Zero\" was expressed by a shake of the head.\r\n\r\nBut Hans could not only count, he could also solve problems in\r\narithmetic. The four fundamental processes were entirely familiar to\r\nhim. Common fractions he changed to decimals, and _vice versa_; he could\r\nsolve problems in mensuration--and all with such ease that it was\r\ndifficult to follow him if one had become somewhat rusty in these\r\nbranches. The following problems are illustrations of the kind he\r\nsolved.[E] \"How much is 2/5 plus 1/2?\" Answer: 9/10. (In the case of all\r\nfractions Hans would first tap the numerator, then the denominator; in\r\nthis case, therefore, first 9, then 10). Or again: \"I have a number in\r\nmind. I subtract 9, and have 3 as a remainder. What is the number I had\r\nin mind?\"--12. \"What are the factors of 28?\"--Thereupon Hans tapped\r\nconsecutively 2, 4, 7, 14, 28. \"In the number 365287149 I place a\r\ndecimal point after the 8. How many are there now in the hundreds\r\nplace?\"--5. \"How many in the ten thousandths place?\"--9. It will be\r\nnoticed, therefore, that he was able to operate with numbers far\r\nexceeding 100, indeed he could manipulate those of six places. We were\r\ntold that this, however, was no longer arithmetical computation in the\r\ntrue sense of the term; Hans merely knew after the analogy of 10 and 100\r\nthat the thousands take the fourth place, the ten-thousands the fifth,\r\netc. If an error entered into Hans' answer, he could nearly always\r\ncorrect it immediately upon being asked: \"By how many units did you go\r\nwrong?\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote E: All examples mentioned are cited from extant works of\r\n    various observers.]\r\n\r\nHans, furthermore, was able to read the German readily, whether written\r\nor printed. Mr. von Osten, however, taught him only the small letters,\r\nnot the capitals. If a series of placards with written words were placed\r\nbefore the horse, he could step up and point with his nose to any of the\r\nwords required of him. He could even spell some of the words. This was\r\ndone by the aid of a table devised by Mr. von Osten, in which every\r\nletter of the alphabet, as well as a number of diphthongs had an\r\nappropriate place which the horse could designate by means of a pair of\r\nnumbers. Thus in the fifth horizontal row \"s\" had first place; \"sch\"\r\nsecond, \"ss,\" third, etc.; so that the horse would indicate the letter\r\n\"s\" by treading first 5, then 1, \"sch,\" by 5 and 2, \"ss\" by 5 and 3.\r\nUpon being asked \"What is this woman holding in her hand?\" Hans spelled\r\nwithout hesitation: 3, 2; 4, 6; 3, 7; i. e., \"Schirm\" (parasol). At\r\nanother time a picture of a horse standing at a manger was shown him and\r\nhe was asked, \"What does this represent?\" He promptly spelled \"Pferd\"\r\n(horse) and then \"Krippe\" (manger).\r\n\r\nHe, moreover, gave evidence of an excellent memory. In passing we might\r\nalso mention that he knew the value of all the German coins. But most\r\nastonishing of all was the following: Hans carried the entire yearly\r\ncalendar in his head; he could give you not only the date for each day\r\nwithout having been previously taught anew, but he could give you the\r\ndate of any day you might mention. He could also answer such inquiries\r\nas this: \"If the eighth day of a month comes on Tuesday, what is the\r\ndate for the following Friday?\" He could tell the time to the minute by\r\na watch and could answer off-hand the question, \"Between what figures is\r\nthe small hand of a watch at 5 minutes after half-past seven?\" or, \"How\r\nmany minutes has the large hand to travel between seven minutes after a\r\nquarter past the hour, and three quarters past?\" Tasks that were given\r\nhim but once would be repeated correctly upon request. The sentence:\r\n\"Bruecke und Weg sind vom Feinde besetzt\" (The bridge and the road are\r\nheld by the enemy), was given to Hans one day and upon the following day\r\nhe tapped consecutively the 58 numbers which were necessary for a\r\ncorrect response. He recognized persons after having seen them but\r\nonce--yes, even their photographs taken in previous years and bearing\r\nbut slight resemblance.\r\n\r\nA corresponding high degree of sensory activity seemed to accompany\r\nthese astonishing feats of memory and reason. Although the horse is not\r\nusually credited with a very keen sense of vision, Hans was able to\r\ncount the windows of distant houses and the street urchins climbing\r\nabout on neighboring roofs. He had an ear for the most subtle nuances of\r\nthe voice. He caught every word,--no matter how softly it was spoken--so\r\nthat we were not allowed to whisper the answer to a problem, even when\r\nstanding at a distance of several yards, since it would be\r\nequivalent--so Mr. von Osten declared--to giving the result to the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nMusical ability also comes into the category of Hans' accomplishments.\r\nHe possessed, not only an absolute tone consciousness--a gift granted to\r\nfew of us in the human world--which enabled him to recognize a note\r\nsounded or sung to him as c, d, etc. (within the once accented scale of\r\nc-major), but also an infallible feeling for intervals, and could\r\ntherefore determine whether two tones, sounded simultaneously, composed\r\na third or fifth, etc. Without difficulty he analyzed compound clangs\r\ninto their components; he indicated their agreeableness or\r\ndisagreeableness and could inform us which tones must be eliminated to\r\nmake consonance out of dissonance. C, d and e were given simultaneously\r\nand Hans was asked: \"Does that sound pleasant?\" He shook his head. \"What\r\ntone must be omitted to make it pleasant?\" Hans trod twice--indicating\r\ntone \"d.\" When the seventh chord, d-f-a-c, was sounded, he shook his\r\nhead disapprovingly. He evidently was old-fashioned in his musical\r\ntastes and not agreeably disposed toward modern music, so he indicated\r\nby tapping that the seventh, c, would have to be eliminated; thus\r\nchanging the seventh chord to a minor chord in order to obtain harmony.\r\nWhen asked what tones might not be given simultaneously with the fourth\r\nand sixth, Hans indicated consecutively the third, fifth and seventh;\r\nthat the first might be added, he was ready to admit. Finally, he was\r\nfamiliar with not less than thirteen melodies and their time.\r\n\r\nNot only in the high degree of development of the senses and the\r\nintellect, but also in that of the feeling and the will, did Hans\r\npossess a decided individuality. Being of a high-strung and nervous\r\ntemperament and governed by moods, he evinced strong likes and dislikes,\r\nand frequently displayed an annoying stubbornness,--a fact often dwelt\r\nupon by Mr. von Osten. He had never felt the whip, and therefore often\r\npersisted in wilfully answering the simplest questions incorrectly and a\r\nmoment later would solve, with the greatest ease, some of the most\r\ndifficult problems. Whenever any one asked a question without himself\r\nknowing the answer, Hans would indulge in all sorts of sport at the\r\nquestioner's expense. We were told that the sensitive animal could\r\neasily perceive the questioner's ignorance and would therefore lose\r\nconfidence in, and respect for, him. It was felt to be desirable,\r\nhowever, to have just such cases with correct responses. Often, too,\r\nHans would persist in giving what seemed an incorrect reply, but which\r\nwas later discovered to be correct. On the other hand it was useless to\r\ntry to get answers upon topics of which he knew nothing. Thus he ignored\r\nquestions put in French or Latin and became fidgety, thereby showing the\r\ngenuineness of his achievements; but upon topics with which he was\r\nfamiliar he could not be led astray. Indeed, there was nothing but\r\nlanguage lacking to make him almost human and the intelligent animal was\r\ndeclared by experienced educators to be at about the stage of\r\ndevelopment of a child of 13 or 14 years.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful horse, which in the opinion of its friends was the means\r\nof deciding in the affirmative the old, old, question of the\r\nrationality of the lower forms and thus changing radically the existing\r\nWeltanschauung, aroused world-wide interest. A flood of articles\r\nappeared in the newspapers and magazines, two monograph[1, 2] attempts at\r\nexplanation were devoted to him.[F] He was made the subject of popular\r\ncouplets, and his name was sung on the vaudeville stage. He appeared\r\nupon picture post-cards and upon liquor labels, and his popularity was\r\nshown by his reincarnation in the form of children's playthings. Many\r\npersonages of note who had seen the horse's exhibitions, declared, some\r\nof them in public statements, that they were now convinced. Among these,\r\nbesides Mr. Schillings, were naturalists of note; e. g.: the African\r\nexplorer Prof. G. Schweinfurth, Dr. Heinroth and Dr. Schaeff, the\r\ndirector of the zoological garden in Hanover; there were likewise\r\nhorse-fanciers of first-rank, such as General Zobel, and the well-known\r\nhippological writer Major R. Schoenbeck. Again, the well-known\r\nzooelogist, K. Moebius, writing in the \"National-zeitung\" declared he was\r\nconvinced of the horse's power to count and to solve arithmetical\r\nproblems. He also said that he believed the horse's memory and acute\r\npower of sense-discrimination to be at the root of the matter. Those who\r\ngleaned all their knowledge of the horse from newspaper reading were\r\nsatisfied to arrest judgment, or, on the other hand, became indignant at\r\nthe supposed imposition on the part of the gentleman of leisure and at\r\nthe gullibility of the public. Some would of course attempt explanations\r\non the basis of older facts. Here we have two points of view.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote F: The works referred to in the text are to be found listed\r\n    on pages 267 ff.]\r\n\r\nSome tried to explain the whole thing on the basis of purely mechanical\r\nmemory and would thus allow the title \"learned\" but not \"intelligent\"\r\nHans. If, for instance, he was able to indicate the component of a clang\r\nof three tones, it was not because he had the power to analyze the\r\ntone-complex, but because he was able to see the stops of the harmonica\r\nand was accustomed to give one tap for every stop which was closed. If\r\nhe was able to tell time by the watch, it was not because he read it,\r\nbut because he was always asked at the same hour of the day (which, of\r\ncourse, was contrary to fact) and because he had learned by heart the\r\nnecessary number of taps. They also said that his manifold arithmetical\r\nachievements were merely the expression of a remarkable memory; that in\r\nthe animal brain, lying fallow for centuries, there was stored up a\r\ntremendous amount of energy, which here had been suddenly released. They\r\njustified their point by calling to mind, in this connection, the\r\nwonderful memory of primitive races. The authors of the two monographs\r\nalready mentioned, Zell and Freund, adopted this 'mnemotechnic'\r\ninterpretation, and the latter considered that he had disposed\r\ndefinitely of the problem in designating the horse--a \"four-legged\r\ncomputing machine.\"\r\n\r\nAnother group would not even allow Hans the glory of a wonderful memory.\r\nHe knew nothing. Rather was he to be regarded as a stupid Hans, and\r\ntotally dependent upon signs or helps given by his master. Only a very\r\nfew believed, however, that such signs--the nature of which was quite\r\nunknown or regarding which only vague unsubstantiated suppositions were\r\nadvanced--were given unintentionally. Most of the critics openly averred\r\nthat we here had to do with intentional control, in other words, with\r\ntricks. But not only did stupid orthodoxy dispose of the matter in this\r\nway, but also the enlightened, who believe everything unusual to be\r\ncontrary to reason. They put the Hans problem on a level with\r\nspiritualism, and were convinced that if the veil were removed a crass\r\nimposition would be revealed. Professional trainers who regarded\r\nthemselves as well informed did not hesitate to give expression to this\r\nsame view, even though they had observed Hans inadequately or not at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe defenders of this second point of view were not at a loss to point\r\nout the signs supposed to be given to Hans. One of these believed he had\r\ndiscovered the primary means for giving these signs in the slouch hat of\r\nMr. von Osten. It was no accident, they said, that Mr. Schillings wore a\r\nslouch hat when he experimented with the horse. It is sufficient to note\r\nthat Mr. Schillings was usually bare-headed or wore only a cap when he\r\ntested the horse. Another accused, in like fashion, the long coat of the\r\nexperimenter; a third, who \"had had opportunity to observe Hans on\r\nseveral occasions,\" declared with equal certainty that the cue lay in\r\nthe movements of the hand as it was thrust into the pocket filled with\r\ncarrots. One circus-star declared, that the trick lay in eye movements,\r\nanother such star declared it lay in the movements of the hand. A sixth\r\ndiscovered that the signs were \"manifold\" and adds, \"to be sure, the\r\ntrainer must have a fund of such signs in order to prevent\r\nembarrassment.\" Such a hypothesis is itself, it would seem, one of\r\nembarrassment. On the other hand, there were many first-class observers\r\nwho vainly tried to discover regularly recurring signs; among them the\r\nonly professional trainer,--who had devoted any satisfactory length of\r\ntime to the horse and had also sought diligently for the signs in\r\nquestion--said, \"I was fully convinced that I would be able to explain\r\nthe problem in this way, but I was mistaken.\" The president of the\r\n\"Internationale Artisten Genossenschaft,\" a person who knew all the\r\nusual means of control in trick performances, went over to the other\r\nside as a result of his observations.\r\n\r\nThere were others who sought for auditory signs. The opinion was\r\nexpressed that \"Hans was unable to answer the simplest question such as\r\n'What is two plus three?' whenever the questioner's tone of voice\r\ndiffered from that of the master's.\" Another put chief stress upon the\r\nchanging inflection; furthermore, a \"high degree of auditory\r\nsensitivity\" was often offered in explanation.\r\n\r\nThe sense of smell was also made to bear some burdens. With its help,\r\nfor instance, Hans was believed to be able to recognize the photograph\r\nof some one present, supposing, of course, that the person had carried\r\nthe picture about with him, thus allowing it to be impregnated with his\r\npeculiar personal odor. One even suggested that the heat radiating from\r\nthe questioner's body and the electric stimulus conducted underground to\r\nHans's foot were sufficient explanation for his remarkable feats.\r\n\r\nEven the so-called N-rays, of one-day fame, which were supposed to\r\nradiate from the human brain when in activity, were offered as a\r\nsolution. A similar thing may have been in the mind of the \"natural\r\nphilosopher\" who even after the publication of the December report,\r\nwrote as follows in one of the journals: \"On the basis of most careful\r\ncontrol, I have come to the conclusion, that the brain of the horse\r\nreceives the thought-waves which radiate from the brain of his master;\r\nfor mental work is, according to the judgment of science, physical\r\nwork.\" Of the same character are the explanations of two others, one of\r\nwhom declares that Hans was acting \"under the magnetic influence of\r\nman\", while the other declared that \"hypnotic suggestion is involved\",\r\nand, ignoring attested facts, tells us that, \"The horse can execute the\r\ncommands of another only when the master, with whom it is 'en rapport',\r\nwills that it shall obey.\" We may close the catalogue of explanations\r\nwith one more, which, in spite of its vagueness, found many defenders,\r\nviz: suggestion. Without defining this conception more specifically and\r\nwithout the slightest notion of the peculiar difficulties which it\r\ninvolves (L. Loewenfeld in his \"Handbuch des Hypnotismus\" [Wiesbaden,\r\n1901, pp. 35ff.] cites twenty different definitions of the term given by\r\nas many authors) a critic writes: \"The astounding phenomenon of an\r\nanimal apparently possessing human reason is to be attributed solely to\r\nsuggestion\". Having referred to a dog trained for the vaudeville-stage,\r\nthe gentleman concludes that, \"our intelligent horse, as well as the\r\ndog, is simply of fine nervous organization and hence highly susceptible\r\nto suggestions\".\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done, with this mass of conflicting explanations?\r\nEveryone considered his own opinion the only correct one, without,\r\nhowever, being able to convince anyone else. The need here was not\r\nsimple affirmation, but proof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nA. EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nThe observations on the horse under ordinary conditions would have been\r\nquite insufficient for arriving at a decision as to the tenability of\r\nthe several possible explanations. For this purpose experimentation with\r\ncontrolled conditions was necessary.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, first, that the place in which the experiments were\r\nperformed should be guarded against sources of error and interruptions.\r\nSeveral difficulties stood in the way of the removal of the horse to a\r\nmore convenient place. Therefore, a large canvas tent was erected within\r\nthe courtyard of Mr. von Osten. This afforded the necessary isolation\r\nwithout hindering the free movements of the horse. After the essential\r\npart of the experiment had been completed and the problem had been\r\npractically solved, experimentation was sometimes conducted in the open\r\ncourtyard. A number of the experiments were also performed in the\r\nhorse's stall.\r\n\r\nThe choice of proper persons to experiment with the horse required\r\ncareful consideration. In so far as observations were to be made upon\r\nthe questioner, Mr. von Osten was of course indispensable. But to\r\nobviate every objection he, as well as Mr. Schillings, had to be\r\nexcluded from the greater part of the experiments, and other persons\r\nhad to be selected who could learn to handle the horse. Now one would\r\nhave thought that the horse would respond to any moderately efficient\r\nexaminer. But as a matter of fact it was found that the horse would not\r\nreact at all in the case of the greater number of persons. Again, in the\r\ncase of others he would respond once or twice, but would then cease. All\r\ntold, Hans responded more or less readily to forty persons, but it was\r\nonly when he worked with Mr. von Osten or with Mr. Schillings, that his\r\nresponses were at all dependable. For this reason I undertook to\r\nbefriend the horse, and by happy chance it came to pass in a short time\r\nhe responded as readily to my questions as to those of the two\r\ngentlemen. In a few of these experiments the Count zu Castell, Count R.\r\nvon Matuschka and Mr. Schillings undertook the role of questioner. Where\r\nthese are not mentioned in the results here published, I myself did the\r\nquestioning.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the number of experiments and their performance, the\r\nfollowing precautions were observed. A sufficiently large number of\r\ntests was made in each series in order to obviate the possibility of the\r\ncontention that the horse's errors were due to chance. The conditions of\r\nexperimentation were such that the further contention that he happened\r\nto be tired or otherwise indisposed, whenever the reactions seemed to be\r\ninadequate, could not be offered. The possibility of confusing the horse\r\nby means of unwonted conditions also had to be avoided. For this reason\r\nit was necessary to alternate the trial in which procedure was with the\r\nknowledge of the answer on the part of the questioner, with the trial in\r\nwhich the procedure was without such knowledge. Such precautions had\r\nhitherto been neglected, and therefore those negative results which had\r\nbeen occasionally obtained in single trials, could not claim objective\r\nvalidity, even though the persons making the tests were subjectively\r\nconvinced.\r\n\r\nThe course of the experiments was determined by the nature of the\r\nproblem itself. By means of a very simple test it was possible to\r\ndiscover whether or not Hans was able to think independently. He was\r\nconfronted with problems in which the procedure was without knowledge of\r\nthe answer on the part of the questioner. If under these conditions he\r\ncould respond with the correct answer--which could be the result of a\r\nrational process only--then the conclusion that he could think\r\nindependently, was warranted. The examination would be closed and Mr.\r\nvon Osten would be justified in all he claimed for the horse. If,\r\nhowever, Hans should fail in this test, then the conclusion that he\r\ncould think was by no means warranted, but rather the inference that he\r\nwas dependent upon certain stimuli received from the questioner or the\r\nenvironment. Further investigation would be for the purpose of\r\ndiscovering the nature of these stimuli.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain by means of which sense organ or organs the horse might\r\nreceive these necessary stimuli, the method of elimination was employed.\r\nWe began by excluding visual stimuli by means of a pair of very large\r\nblinders. Should this investigation be without results, then we would\r\nproceed to test the sense of hearing. The elimination of auditory\r\nstimulations would be more difficult, because ear-caps or the closing of\r\nthe passage by means of cotton would not give sufficient assurance that\r\nthe sound-waves were being interrupted, even if the horse were docile\r\nenough to suffer these appliances. Thereupon would follow the testing of\r\nthe sense of smell and of the skin-senses. And finally there might be\r\ninvolved another still unknown sense, such as seems to exist in the\r\nlower animal-forms. The reader therefore can readily see that the\r\ninvestigation might possibly have become very complex, and that the\r\ninvestigator had to be prepared for all of these possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe results of the experiments and the essential circumstances under\r\nwhich they were conducted, were in every case recorded immediately.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that in the final formulation of the results, all\r\nvalues--including those which were not consonant with the majority--were\r\nto be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\r\n\r\nDuring the course of these experiments Hans wore his accustomed\r\ntrappings, i. e., a girdle, light headgear and snaffle, and he either\r\nstood alone, untied, or was held loosely by the bridle either by the\r\nquestioner or (though only in a few instances) by his attendant. The\r\nquestioner always stood to the right of the horse, as Mr. von Osten had\r\nbeen accustomed to do. As reward for correct responses Hans received\r\nfrom the questioner[G]--and from him only--a bit of bread or carrot, and\r\nat times also a square of sugar. Never was a whip applied. From time to\r\ntime the horse was led about the courtyard or was allowed to run loose\r\nin order to secure the needful respite. Besides myself there was usually\r\npresent Prof. Stumpf and Dr. von Hornbostel, who kept the records, and\r\nfrequently also Mr. von Osten. Several times I worked alone with the\r\nhorse. The results obtained in the horse's stall were in no respect\r\ndifferent from those got in the course of the experiments carried on in\r\nthe courtyard. Whenever a doubt arose as to the number of taps made by\r\nthe horse (though this did not frequently occur), then the series in\r\nquestion was immediately repeated.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote G: The expressions _questioner_ and _experimenter_ are used\r\n    interchangeably in this treatise.]\r\n\r\nIn this report of the results of our experiments, the reader must bear\r\nin mind that it was impossible to adhere to that order and distribution\r\nof tests which we are wont to require in the case of psychophysical\r\nexperiments conducted under regular laboratory conditions. All sorts of\r\ndifficulties had to be overcome: unfavorable weather, the crowds of\r\ncurious ones, certain peculiarities of the horse--such as shying\r\nwhenever the wind rippled the canvas of the tent--and last but not\r\nleast, the idiosyncrasies of Mr. von Osten who repeatedly attempted to\r\ninterrupt the progress of the experiments.\r\n\r\nSince it was evident that different kinds of processes were involved in\r\nsolving the problems and since the solutions would be indicated by\r\ntapping, or by movements of the head, or by walking over to the object\r\nto be designated, the results of these three sets of experiments have\r\nbeen grouped under three corresponding heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I. Problems solved by tapping_\r\n\r\nThe following tests were made in which the method was such that when the\r\nproblem was presented to the horse, the correct solution was known to\r\nnone of those present, least of all to the questioner. This method we\r\nshall designate in the following report as \"procedure without knowledge\"\r\nwhereas we shall call the method in which the answer was known to the\r\nquestioner, \"procedure with knowledge\".\r\n\r\nIn order to discover if the horse could read numbers, a series of cards\r\non which numerals were blazoned, were exposed to the horse's view in\r\nsuch a way that none of those present was able to see them, and the\r\nhorse was asked to tap the numbers as they were shown. This experiment\r\nwas repeated at different times and in all there were 49 tests in which\r\nprocedure was without knowledge, and 42 in which procedure was with\r\nknowledge. In the case of the former there were 8% correct responses,\r\nwhereas in the case of the latter 98% of the answers were right. As an\r\nexample of the course which the series tended to take, we insert the\r\nfollowing, in which Mr. von Osten himself acted as questioner.\r\n\r\n      Method.          No. exposed.     No. tapped.\r\n\r\n  Without knowledge         8               14\r\n  With       \"              8                8\r\n  Without    \"              4                8\r\n  With       \"              4                4\r\n  Without    \"              7                9\r\n  With       \"              7                7\r\n  Without    \"             10               17\r\n  With       \"             10               10\r\n  Without    \"              3                9\r\n  With       \"              3                3 etc.\r\n\r\nWhenever the questioner knew the solution, nearly all of the horse's\r\nanswers were correct; but when the answers were unknown to the\r\nquestioner, the horse's responses were, with only a few exceptions,\r\nquite unsuccessful. Since the few exceptional cases must be regarded as\r\nfortuitous, the conclusion is warranted that the horse was unable to\r\nread numerals without assistance.\r\n\r\nIn order to discover whether the horse could read words such as \"Hans\"\r\nor \"Stall\" or the names of colors, they were written upon placards and\r\nhung up in a row before the horse in such a way that the questioner\r\ncould see the individual word but could not immediately recognize the\r\nparticular place that each one occupied in the series. The horse was\r\nthen asked: \"Upon which placard is the word 'Hans'?\", \"On which is the\r\nword 'Stall'?\", etc. In order to make sure, he was required to repeat\r\neach answer.\r\n\r\nThen the experimenter would determine for himself the place of the word\r\nin the series and would ask the question again. Fourteen such tests, in\r\nwhich the procedure was with knowledge on the part of the questioner,\r\nwere interspersed with twelve in which the procedure was without such\r\nknowledge. With the latter there were no correct responses, whereas in\r\nthe cases of procedure with knowledge 100% of the answers were correct.\r\nEvidently the horse could not read words.\r\n\r\nThree words were thereupon whispered in his ear, which he was asked to\r\nspell in accordance with the method described on page 21. Since he had\r\nto indicate first the row, and then the place in the row occupied by the\r\nletter, it took two answers to indicate the position of each letter. I\r\nacted as questioner. The ordering of the table of letters was unknown to\r\nme, except the position of the letter \"a\", which naturally came first,\r\nand the place of the letter \"s\", concerning whose position I had\r\npurposely inquired. The words chosen for this experiment were \"Arm\",\r\n\"Rom\" (Rome) and \"Hans\". The horse responded incorrectly in the case of\r\nevery letter which was unknown to the questioner. \"A\" and \"s\" alone were\r\ngiven correctly. Thus in spelling the word \"Rom\" the horse responded\r\nwith the series 3, 4; 3, 4; 5, 4; 5, 4; i. e. \"jjst\", instead of the\r\ncorrect series: 4, 6; 4, 2; 3, 7. I later selected three other words,\r\nthe spelling of which involved the tapping of thirty-two numbers on the\r\npart of Hans, and whose position I had carefully ascertained beforehand.\r\nWhen these were given to the horse to spell, he responded promptly\r\nwithout a single error. Evidently Hans was unable to spell without\r\nassistance of some sort from the questioner.\r\n\r\nThe horse's reputed aptitude in computation was tested in the following\r\nway. Mr. von Osten whispered a number in the horse's ear so that none of\r\nthe persons present could hear. Thereupon I did likewise. Hans was asked\r\nto add the two. Since each of the experimenters knew only his own\r\nnumber, the sum, if known to anyone, could be known to Hans alone. Every\r\nsuch test was immediately repeated with the result known to the\r\nexperimenters. In 31 tests in which the method was procedure without\r\nknowledge, 3 of the horse's answers were correct, whereas in the 31\r\ntests in which the method was procedure with knowledge, 29 of his\r\nresponses were correct. Since the three correct answers in the cases in\r\nwhich procedure was without knowledge evidently were accidental, the\r\nresults of this series of experiments show that Hans was unable to solve\r\narithmetical problems.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of discovering whether the horse could at least count,\r\nthe Russian kindergarten device, which Mr. von Osten had used in\r\ntraining, was utilized. The machine was placed before the horse, but the\r\nexperimenter turned his back upon it. Before each test, a number of\r\nballs were pushed to one side and Hans's problem was to indicate the\r\nnumber thus separated. Each test was repeated with procedure with\r\nknowledge. Of eight such experiments Hans responded successfully every\r\ntime procedure was with knowledge but failed every time procedure was\r\nwithout knowledge. Thus 7 balls were at one time designated as 9 and\r\nlater as 14, while 6 were at first designated as 12, and later as 10.\r\nSince all these errors could not be accounted for on the ground of\r\nmiscounts on the part of the horse, it was evident that Hans is quite\r\nunable to count.\r\n\r\nThe memory-test was conducted in the following manner. In the absence of\r\nthe questioner a number or the name of some day of the week was spoken\r\nto the horse. The experimenter would then return and question him. Of 10\r\nresponses 2 were correct, 8 incorrect. Among the correct answers were\r\nthe number 3, a number which, as we shall see, Hans was prone to give\r\nunder all sorts of conditions, and which therefore meant very little\r\nwhen given as a correct response. The number 2, on the other hand, was\r\nconsecutively indicated by 7, 9, 5, and 3, 8 was given as 5, 6, 4, and\r\n6, consecutively; and finally Wednesday was indicated as the fourteenth\r\nday of the week. After this we undertook the test the horse's far-famed\r\nknowledge of the calendar. Dates, such as Feb. 29, Nov. 12, etc., were\r\ngiven to Hans and he was asked to indicate on which day of the week they\r\nfell. Sunday was to be indicated by 1, Monday by 2, etc. Of 14 such\r\ntests, 10 were unsuccessful, 4 successful. But in the case of these 4\r\nsomething very interesting occurred. It happened that during this series\r\nthe keeper of the horse was present, and he happened to know the days on\r\nwhich these dates fell,--as he himself testified. The dates in question\r\nwere also little more than a week or so from the day of the experiment,\r\nso they could easily be determined. But as soon as we took more remote\r\ndates both man and beast were hopelessly lost. It was certain that Hans\r\nhad no knowledge of the calendar. It is needless to say anything of his\r\nsupposed knowledge of cards and coins. Hans plainly was incapable of\r\nthe astonishing feats of memory which had been claimed for him.\r\n\r\nFinally we investigated Hans' musical ability. In a room adjoining the\r\nhorse's stall there was a small harmonica, which spanned the once\r\naccented octave. On this one or more tones were played. The horse was\r\nrequired to indicate the tone played, the number of tones played and\r\ntheir relation to one another. For testing his general hearing 20 tests\r\nwere given in which the method was procedure without knowledge. Of the\r\nresponses only one was correct, and that one was the tone e, for which\r\nthe proper response was three taps, but we must bear in mind what has\r\nalready been said of the number 3. The tone b was indicated by 11 taps,\r\nalthough Hans had only learned a scale of one octave and therefore could\r\nrespond to only seven tones. In the tests in which the method was\r\nprocedure with knowledge, he again, without exception, was successful.\r\nSimilar results were obtained in the analysis of compound clangs. In the\r\ncases of procedure without knowledge (although the experimenter here\r\nknew the correct responses, he purposely refrained from thinking of\r\nthem) not a single response was correct; while in the cases of procedure\r\nwith knowledge, all but one were correct. The following were typical\r\nresponses: Three tones were played and the question was asked, \"How many\r\ntones were played?\" Hans responded first with 4 taps and then with 1.\r\nThe tones c, e, g, a, (1, 3, 5, 6) were struck and the question asked,\r\n\"Which tone must be eliminated to make the complex a chord?\" In the\r\ntests in which the method had been procedure with knowledge, this\r\nquestion had always been answered correctly, but when procedure was\r\nwithout knowledge the responses were first 13, a tone which does not\r\nexist for Hans, then 2, a tone which was not given in the clang to be\r\nanalyzed, and finally 3, which was not the discordant tone. Hans's\r\nfar-famed musical ability was an illusion.\r\n\r\nTaking the results of all the tests into consideration, we find that in\r\nthe case of procedure with knowledge, 90 to 100% of the responses of the\r\nvarious series were correct, whereas, in those series of procedure\r\nwithout knowledge 10%, at most, of the responses were correct. Under the\r\nconditions prevailing during these latter tests, even these 10% must be\r\nregarded as due to chance. To be sure Mr. Grabow, a member of the school\r\nboard and an enthusiastic follower of Mr. von Osten (Zeitschrift fuer\r\nPaedagogische Psychologie, Pathologie und Hygiene, Berlin, 1904, Jahrg.\r\n6, Heft. 6, S. 470), mentions a large number of successful tests, which\r\nwere supposedly made in accordance with the method of procedure without\r\nknowledge. A thorough analysis of his experiments was not possible,\r\nbecause the conditions under which they were conducted were not\r\nadequately specified. But I have no doubt that the successful responses\r\nof the horse were due solely to the absence of precautionary measures.\r\nI, too, could cite a number of seemingly correct responses which\r\ndemonstrably were due to the absence of adequate precautionary measures.\r\nI therefore repeat: Hans can neither read, count nor make calculations.\r\nHe knows nothing of coins or cards, calendars or clocks, nor can he\r\nrespond, by tapping or otherwise, to a number spoken to him but a moment\r\nbefore. Finally, he has not a trace of musical ability.\r\n\r\nAfter all this experimentation it was evident that the horse was unable\r\nto work alone, but was dependent upon certain stimuli from its\r\nenvironment. The question therefore arose: does the horse get these\r\nstimuli while the question is being put, or during his responses, i. e.,\r\nduring the process of tapping.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. von Osten's opinion was correct, then the process of questioning\r\nplayed an important part in the success of the experiment. Of course, as\r\nhe said, it was not necessary to ask the question aloud; it was\r\nsufficient--curiously enough--that it be inwardly spoken, thanks to the\r\nhorse's extraordinary auditory sensitivity. If, however, conditions were\r\nmade such that the auditory sense was eliminated, then the animal would\r\nbe unable to respond. Such a theory is not quite as absurd as it might\r\nseem at first blush. For Hansen and Lehmann have shown that an acute\r\nauditory organ is able to respond to such delicate stimulation as is\r\ninvolved in the softest whisper, or even in the so-called nasal whisper\r\nin which the lips are tightly closed.[3] They have attempted thus to\r\nexplain any modes of supposed \"thought-transference\", (cf. page 7).\r\nSince experts on horses agree that the horse has acute auditory\r\nsensitivity, Mr. von Osten seized upon this fact and tried to establish\r\nhis theory in the following manner. No response was successfully made on\r\nthe part of the horse, he said, when the sound waves caused by his (Mr.\r\nvon Osten's) inner speech were deflected from the ear of the horse. This\r\nwas the case when he closed nose and mouth while inwardly putting the\r\nquestion, or deflected the waves from the horse's ear by means of a\r\nplacard held before his mouth while speaking, or finally by applying\r\nlined ear-muffs to the horse's ears. If, on the other hand, he closed\r\nonly his nose and not his mouth while thus inwardly putting the\r\nquestion, or if he held the placard so that there was a possibility of\r\ndeflecting the sounds to the horse's ear, or if the ear-muffs were of\r\ntoo sheer a material, then Hans could hear and answer the questions\r\nwhich for human ears were inaudible. He demonstrated all this by means\r\nof experiments and of 20 tests of the first kind, in which auditory\r\nsensations were supposedly eliminated, 95% of the responses were\r\nincorrect (Hans would always tap too great a number); whereas of 28\r\ntests of the second kind, not a single answer was wrong, just as had\r\nbeen predicted. Now I have repeated both kinds of tests, but have always\r\nfound some correct responses in those cases in which the horse,\r\nsupposedly, was unable to hear, a thing which greatly astonished Mr. von\r\nOsten. In fact, the responses of the horse were quite as correct when I\r\ndid not even whisper the question inwardly. It was quite clear that\r\nputting the question in any form whatever was wholly unnecessary. Mr.\r\nvon Osten's demonstrations to the contrary, which were based upon\r\nerroneous physical principles, are to be explained as cases of vivid\r\nautosuggestions, (but of this, more in Chapter V). After all this\r\nexperimentation, it was manifest that the cue was not given to the horse\r\nwhile the question was being put; it occurred, therefore, at some time\r\nduring the process of tapping. But by means of which sense organ was it\r\nreceived by the horse?\r\n\r\nWe began by examining the sense of vision, and in the following manner.\r\nBlinders were applied, and it is worthy of mention that Hans made no\r\nattempt to resist. The questioner stood to the right of the horse, so\r\nthat the animal knew him to be present and could hear, but not see him.\r\nHans was requested to tap a certain number. Then the experimenter would\r\nstep forward into the horse's field of vision and would put the same\r\nproblem again. Since, in the tests of the first kind, Hans would always\r\nmake the most strenuous efforts to get a view of the questioner, and\r\nsince he would rave and tear at the lines whenever the attempt was made\r\nto tie him,--a thing which he had never done hitherto,--it was\r\nimpossible to determine in some cases whether or not he had seen the\r\nquestioner during the process of tapping. I am using, therefore, in the\r\nfollowing exposition, besides the two categories of \"not seen\" and\r\n\"seen\", a third which I have called \"undecided\". A total of 102 tests\r\nwere made in which large blinders were used. In 35 of these, the\r\nexperimenter certainly was \"not seen\" in 56 cases he was \"seen\" and the\r\nremaining 11 are \"undecided\". Under the first of these categories 6% of\r\nHans's answers were correct (i. e. only two), under the second head 89%\r\nwere correct and under the third 18% were right. In other words, the\r\nhorse was at a loss the moment he was prevented from seeing the\r\nquestioner; whereas his responses were nearly always correct when the\r\nexperimenter was in sight, certain proof that the horse's failures are\r\nto be attributed to the elimination of visual stimuli and not to the\r\ngeneral inconvenience occasioned by the blinders. It is evident\r\ntherefore, that the horse required certain visual stimuli or signs in\r\norder to make a correct response.[H]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote H: Throughout this treatise I am using the word \"sign,\" or\r\n    \"signal,\" whereas all other writers who have touched upon the\r\n    Hans-problem, have always spoken of \"aids.\" Following von Sanden,[4]\r\n    however, I would distinguish clearly between the two. I would\r\n    designate as aids all immediate stimulations of the horse's body (i.\r\n    e. by means of contact), which have been designed with reference to\r\n    the animal's physiological movement-mechanism in such a way that\r\n    they truly 'aid' him in the production of the required movements. I\r\n    would regard as signs on the other hand, all stimulations (whether\r\n    mediate or immediate) which are selected without especial regard to\r\n    the anatomy or physiology of the horse, and bear no inseparable\r\n    relation to the thing to be done but are associated with it at the\r\n    will of the trainer. The rider's use of reins, and control by means\r\n    of leg-pressure and manner of sitting in the saddle, and the\r\n    driver's use of the lines,----all these, then are aids. A simple\r\n    pull at the reins, however, is not an aid, but a sign. The whip may\r\n    be used for giving signs as well as aids,----the latter, when it\r\n    does the work of the spur or of the pressure with the knees, as is\r\n    the case with ladies' riding-horses and in lunging. All calls and\r\n    all movements of the hand or head merely, on the part of the\r\n    trainer, are to be regarded as signs.]\r\n\r\nSuch unequivocal results, however, were only obtained after we had\r\nprovided blinders of sufficient size (15 x 15 centimeters). Mr. von\r\nOsten believing that the horse would not suffer these to be applied, had\r\nat first proposed other measures. He held a slate before his face. Some\r\nof the horse's responses were right, others wrong. The tests were\r\nrepeated and were successful as long as I, myself, held the slate before\r\nmy face, but not a single one of the responses was correct when another\r\nwould attempt to hold the slate before me. Mr. von Osten then brought\r\nforth a kind of bolster which he fastened on the right side of the\r\nhorse's face,--the side which was turned toward the questioner. But this\r\nalso gave uncertain results. Finally he agreed to apply blinders. But\r\nthese were much too small and projected at a great angle from the head\r\n(Mr. von Osten had cut the straps, for he thought they worried the\r\nanimal). The result was that only the posterior part of the horse's\r\nnormal field of vision was obstructed. Therefore, one could never be\r\nquite sure whether Hans, who--it will be borne in mind--made every\r\nattempt to see the questioner, had not perhaps after all been able to\r\npeer over the edge of the blinder. The number of \"undecided\" tests,\r\ntherefore, became very great. Of 108 tests, only 25 could be placed in\r\nthe category of \"not seen\", 44 in the \"seen\", and 39, i. e., a third of\r\nthe total, in the \"undecided.\" The percentage of correct answers for\r\nthese three categories were, respectively: 24%, 82% and 72%. Here we\r\nhave once more approximately the same ratio between the categories of\r\n\"seen\" and \"not seen\" as in the case of the tests with the smaller\r\nblinders. If we were to count the cases which we had put under the head\r\nof \"undecided,\" in the same category as those in which vision had been\r\nexcluded--as Mr. von Osten had done--then one would have been led to the\r\nconclusion that the horse did not need visual signs. Several observers\r\nhad thus been led astray: e. g., General Zobel writes in the\r\n\"National-Zeitung\" (Aug. 28, 1904), that upon request Mr. von Osten had\r\ncovered Hans's right eye \"by means of some sort of blinder, so that he\r\nwas unable to see his instructor\", and that Hans did not fail to respond\r\ncorrectly. We evidently have here to do with the unreliable bolster\r\nmentioned above. Furthermore, Mr. Schillings made a number of tests with\r\nthe small blinders, in which 50% of the answers were correct, and\r\nprobably in the same manner were obtained the results published in one\r\nof the daily papers (the \"Berliner Tageblatt\", Dec. 12, 1904), several\r\ndays after the publication of the December report, and reading as\r\nfollows: \"Tests have been made upon Hans with blinders over his eyes and\r\nit is to be noted that, in spite of these, he still responds correctly.\"\r\nMention is also made of the experiments noted in Supplement III (page\r\n257), in which Mr. von Osten hid behind the questioner and merely\r\nencouraged the animal by occasional exhortations, but it is not possible\r\nto say with any degree of certainty in how far he was really hidden from\r\nthe horse's view.\r\n\r\nI would add that the horse--in so far as it was at all possible to\r\ndecide--never looked at the persons or the objects which he was to\r\ncount, or at the words which he was to read, yet he nevertheless gave\r\nthe proper responses. But he would always make the most strenuous\r\nefforts to see the questioner. (See page 43). I would furthermore add\r\nthat several experiments, in which Mr. von Osten and the horse were\r\nseparated from each other by means of the canvas tent, failed\r\ncompletely, and that, on the other hand, all tests were successful in\r\nwhich the questioner was present in the feed-room and the door between\r\nthis and the horse's stall was opened wide enough for him to be seen by\r\nthe horse. I would also mention that toward evening the responses became\r\nless and less accurate. The conclusion that visual stimuli were here\r\noperative cannot be gainsaid.\r\n\r\nIt was possible, to be sure, that other senses might also be involved,\r\nbut it was certain that auditory sensations did not enter it. This is\r\nshown by the fact that one might remain just as silent while the horse\r\nwas tapping his answer as during the putting of the question and yet\r\nobtain a correct response. Hans, furthermore, could scarcely be\r\ndistracted by auditory stimulations. If either the experimenter or\r\nanyone else present sought, at a given moment, to interrupt him by such\r\ncalls as \"Halt\", \"Wrong\", etc., while he was going through the process\r\nof tapping, they very seldom succeeded in their attempt. Even though\r\nsuch interruption did succeed in seven out of the twenty-one cases in\r\nwhich it was tried, the assumption is well grounded that the success was\r\ndue entirely or almost entirely to minimal movements involuntarily\r\nexecuted by those attempting the interruption. It is to such minimal\r\nmovements that the horse, as we shall see later, promptly reacted. When\r\nthe experimenter (Pfungst), himself, made the interjections, which\r\ncertainly should have been more effective, we found that the horse was\r\nactually disturbed in only two of the fourteen cases; and finally in ten\r\nconsecutive cases of attempted interruption not a single one was\r\nsuccessful. There was almost a complete absence of any ear movements on\r\nthe part of the horse, a fact in which I have been borne out by Mr.\r\nHenry Suermondt, the distinguished horseback rider. Indeed, I cannot\r\nrecall that Hans ever turned his ears toward me, a fact which is\r\nstrikingly curious in the case of a horse so attentive and so spirited\r\nin temper.\r\n\r\nFinally, I might also mention that the breathing of the experimenter in\r\nno wise influenced the outcome of the experiment. Whether he held his\r\nbreath or breathed on the leg or body of the horse, made no difference.\r\n\r\nInvestigations of the other senses became needless, for I had, in the\r\nmeantime, succeeded in discovering the essential and effective signs in\r\nthe course of my observations of Mr. von Osten. These signs are minimal\r\nmovements of the head on the part of the experimenter. As soon as the\r\nexperimenter had given a problem to the horse, he, involuntarily, bent\r\nhis head and trunk slightly forward and the horse would then put the\r\nright foot forward and begin to tap, without, however, returning it each\r\ntime to its original position. As soon as the desired number of taps was\r\ngiven, the questioner would make a slight upward jerk of the head.\r\nThereupon the horse would immediately swing his foot in a wide circle,\r\nbringing it back to its original position. (This movement, which in the\r\nfollowing exposition we shall designate as \"the back step\", was never\r\nincluded in the count.) Now after Hans had ceased tapping, the\r\nquestioner would raise his head and trunk to their normal position. This\r\nsecond, far coarser movement was not the signal for the back-step, but\r\nalways followed it. But whenever this second movement was omitted, Hans,\r\nwho had already brought back his foot to the original position and had\r\nthereby put it out of commission, as it were, would give one more tap\r\nwith his left foot.\r\n\r\nIf it was true that these movements of the questioner guided the horse\r\nin his tapping, then the following must be shown: First, that the same\r\nmovements were observed in Mr. von Osten in every case of successful\r\nresponse; secondly, that they recurred in the same order or with only\r\nslight individual changes in the case of all who were able to obtain\r\nsuccessful responses from the horse, and that they were absent or\r\noccurred at the wrong time in all cases of unsuccessful response.\r\nFurthermore, it was observed that it was possible to bring about\r\nunsuccessful reactions on the part of the horse as soon as the movements\r\nwere voluntarily suppressed, and conversely, that by voluntarily giving\r\nthe necessary signs the horse might be made to respond at pleasure; so\r\nthat anyone who possessed the knowledge of the proper signs could\r\nthereby gain control over the process of response on the part of the\r\nhorse. These requirements have all been fulfilled, as we shall see in\r\nthe following pages.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the regular recurrence of the movements noticed in the\r\ncase of Mr. von Osten, I was, after some practice, able to note\r\ncarefully their peculiar characteristics. This was rather difficult, not\r\nonly on account of their extreme minuteness, but also because that very\r\nvivacious gentleman made sundry accompanying movements and was\r\nconstantly moving back and forth. To abstract from these the essential\r\nand really effective movements was truly difficult. It was much easier\r\nto observe these movements in the case of Mr. Schillings, probably on\r\naccount of the fewer accompanying movements and perhaps on account of\r\ntheir greater distinctness. Usually he would raise the entire trunk a\r\ntrifle, so that the movements could be noticed from behind. Besides\r\nthese, I had an opportunity to observe the Count zu Castell, Mr. Hahn\r\nand the Count Matuschka. All three made the same movements, though\r\nsomewhat more minutely than Mr. Schillings, yet none was as slight as\r\nthose of Mr. von Osten.[I] I further noticed that Count Matuschka and\r\nMr. Schillings often showed a tendency to accompany every tap of the\r\nhorse with a slight nod of the head, the last being accompanied by a\r\nmore pronounced nod and then followed by the upward jerk of the head, in\r\nother words, they beat time with the horse. In the case of the last\r\nthree mentioned, for whom the horse responded far less effectively than\r\nfor Mr. von Osten or Mr. Schillings, belated or precipitate jerks would\r\nfrequently occur. This was found to be true in the case of all other\r\npersons who had failed to elicit adequate responses from the horse.\r\nOften, in both cases, a complete absence of any kind of minimal movement\r\nhad been noted. The accuracy of these observations in the case of Mr.\r\nvon Osten is attested by Mr. Stumpf and Mr. von Hornbostel, and by these\r\nsame gentlemen and Prof. F. Schumann in the case of Mr. Schillings and\r\nmyself. They also found these movements to be most minute in the case of\r\nMr. von Osten. In my case also they pronounced them \"minimal, and often\r\nquite imperceptible\". All other persons who have seen me work with the\r\nhorse, but who were not familiar with the nature of these movements,\r\nnever perceived them, no matter how closely they observed me.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I: During the tests Mr. von Osten nearly always wore a\r\n    slouch hat with a wide rim. The rim, of course, always moved with\r\n    the head, and made the movements appear on a larger scale, (in the\r\n    ratio of about 3:2, as I was able to ascertain later by graphic\r\n    methods). But observation was successful, even at a distance of a\r\n    meter and a half, when he worked with head uncovered. And even if\r\n    head and forehead were covered entirely, it was still possible to\r\n    note the movements by watching the eye-brows. When Mr. Schillings\r\n    and the rest of us worked with the horse, we either went bare-headed\r\n    or wore only a very small cap.]\r\n\r\nSince the doubt was expressed that these movements did not precede but\r\nfollowed closely upon the back-step of the horse (i. e., that an error\r\nwith regard to the time-element was involved), it became important that\r\ntime measurements be taken. This was done in the following manner: The\r\nquestioner asked the horse to tap numbers from 5 to 20, seldom higher.\r\nHe purposely refrained from pronouncing the number, but recorded it\r\nafter each test had been completed. This was a matter of indifference to\r\nthe horse (see page 42), and had the advantage that the measurement was\r\nnot influenced by knowledge on the part of the time-keeper. Two\r\nobservers were required, one watching the horse, the other the\r\nquestioner. Both observers had fifth-second stop-watches. The larger\r\nface of this watch shows the fifth-second and a hand on the smaller face\r\nindicates the minute. By pressing upon the stem the watch may be set in\r\nmotion at any moment desired, and by pressing it once more it may be\r\ninstantly stopped, and the time elapsing between the setting in motion\r\nand the stopping may be read on the face. By pressing upon the stem a\r\nthird time the hands are brought back to zero, and the watch is ready\r\nfor another test. At a moment agreed upon beforehand--usually the third\r\ntap of the horse--both observers started their watches. Practice tests\r\nhad shown that this could be done with all the accuracy necessary in\r\nthis case. As soon as the observer of the questioner noticed the\r\nlatter's head movement he stopped his watch, and as soon as the observer\r\nof the horse noticed the latter's back-step he stopped his watch. Since\r\nthe movement of the horse's foot does not occur as a jerk, but is of\r\ngreater extent than a jerk would be, it was agreed that the observer was\r\nto stop the watch as soon as he recognized the back-step as such, not\r\nwhen the foot was being raised from the ground, because it was not then\r\nevident whether the horse would bring it back to the original position\r\nor whether he was preparing to give another tap, nor when he had brought\r\nhis foot completely back, but at the moment in which it was evident that\r\nthe horse intended to make the back-step. Experimentation had shown that\r\nan agreement as to this moment was possible. A tap with the left foot,\r\nwhich might possibly follow upon the back-step, could be left out of\r\naccount. The difference in time between the two watches would show the\r\ntime between the head-jerk of the questioner and the back-step of the\r\nhorse,[J] and if the back-step was indeed a reaction upon the\r\nhead-jerk, then the watches would have to show a later time for the\r\nback-step than for the head-jerk.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote J: For the benefit of those who are familiar with\r\n    reaction-time experiments of this kind, I would state the following:\r\n    The reaction to the head-jerk, on account of the minuteness of the\r\n    latter, was sensory throughout, and therefore all precipitate\r\n    reactions are entirely wanting. The reaction to the back-step was,\r\n    like the preceding one, a reaction to a visual cue. (Hans's tapping\r\n    was almost quite inaudible). Both stop-watches were carefully\r\n    regulated. In order to eliminate also the constant error which might\r\n    possibly arise as a result of some difference in the functioning of\r\n    their pressure-mechanism, the two watches were always exchanged in\r\n    the different series of tests, by the observer of the man and the\r\n    observer of the horse. The two time-measurements obtained by the two\r\n    observers contained, of course, the reaction-times of the observers\r\n    themselves. In order to equalize the constant error which thereby\r\n    arose, it was arranged that each observer should react alternately\r\n    now to the man, now to the horse. In order to be perfectly safe, the\r\n    reaction-times of those concerned, (von Hornbostel, Pfungst,\r\n    Schumann and Stumpf), were later determined in the laboratory by\r\n    means of the carefully regulated Hipp chronoscope. Separate\r\n    determinations were made of the reactions to the head-jerk and to an\r\n    imitation of the horse's back-step. Then the time which one observer\r\n    took to react upon a head-jerk, was compared with the reaction-times\r\n    of the other observers to the back-step. Since the greatest\r\n    difference which was found in this comparison, did not exceed\r\n    one-tenth second, the results obtained in the courtyard required no\r\n    correction.]\r\n\r\nMeasurements of this kind were taken for Mr. von Osten, Mr. Schillings\r\nand myself. In the case of the first two it was taken without any\r\nknowledge on their part. They did not even know that they were being\r\nobserved, having been told that the measurements were for the sake of\r\ndetermining the horse's rate. In my case, to be sure, the time could not\r\nbe taken without my knowledge. I succeeded, however, in eliminating the\r\neffect of this knowledge on my part. (Cf. pages 88 and 145.) Since the\r\nresults obtained in the case of Mr. Schillings quite agree with those\r\nobtained in my case, it is evident they may be considered as being of\r\nequal value.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the number of tests the following table may be referred\r\nto. The first vertical column gives the name of the questioner, i. e.\r\nthe person operating with the horse. The four other columns give the\r\nnumber of tests made upon each of these. The name of the person who made\r\nthe observation in each series is indicated at the head of the column.\r\nIt is unnecessary to give the name of the observer of the horse, for the\r\nonly difficulty lay in the observation of the questioner. The numerals I\r\nand II indicate two series taken at different times.\r\n\r\n  -----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n                   |   v.

Four\r\ntests of this kind were made by Mr. von Hornbostel, two by Mr. Pfungst,\r\ntwo by Mr. Schumann and five by Mr. Stumpf. In the case of Mr. Pfungst\r\nthe horse gave the unusually high number of fifty taps. The attention of\r\nthe observer had been taxed too long and had failed him (two seconds is\r\nthe most favorable time). The head-jerk of Mr. von Osten evidently\r\noccurred during a lapse in Mr. Pfungst's attention and therefore\r\nremained unnoticed.\r\n\r\n  -----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n                   |   v.

The\r\ngeneral arrangement corresponds to that of the first table. Even though\r\nthe absolute number of tests was small, yet for the sake of giving a\r\nbetter general view, all values are given in percentages. The tests in\r\nwhich the movement of the questioner had preceded that of the horse--as\r\nhad been anticipated--are recorded under \"R\" (right); under \"W\" (wrong),\r\nwe have recorded those cases in which the testimony of the\r\nstop-watches--contrary to our expectation--indicated that the reverse\r\norder prevailed. Finally, those cases which would complete the 100%, i.\r\ne. those in which the watches indicate simultaneity of the movements in\r\nquestion, are not recorded.\r\n\r\nFrom this table we may note the following: The time-measurements for Mr.\r\nSchillings and Mr. Pfungst are quite in agreement and go to show that\r\nthe order in time of the head movement of the questioner and the\r\nback-step of the horse was exactly what had been expected. The few\r\ncontradictory cases which occur in Series I of the observations upon Mr.\r\nSchillings are to be accounted for by the fact that he was here for the\r\nfirst time the subject of observation, whereas the recorded\r\ntime-measurements in the case of Mr. Pfungst had been preceded by a\r\nnumber of practice tests. The results of the measurements taken in the\r\ncase of Mr. von Osten were far less satisfactory. Even if one were to\r\nallow a series containing barely more than 50% of \"right\" cases as\r\nsufficient proof of the correctness of our expectation regarding the\r\norder of the movements of the questioner and the horse, only three of\r\nthe six series obtained with Mr. von Osten as subject, would satisfy\r\nthis expectation. However, since four of the six series show a greater\r\nnumber of cases of simultaneity (their percentage may be easily deduced\r\nby referring to the per cent of \"right\" and \"wrong\" cases), the proposed\r\nmethod would give a distorted view, and therefore it appears that the\r\nmore correct method would be to consider simply the numerical ratio of\r\nthe \"right\" and \"wrong\" cases. Since, furthermore, Series II shows, in\r\nevery case, a decided change which is similar for all observers (note\r\nespecially Pfungst), there can be no doubt but that practice is here\r\ninvolved, and that Series II is to be regarded as the true standard.\r\nThroughout this series we find a preponderance of \"right\" cases.\r\nTherefore, the table unmistakably confirms the expected order in time.\r\nThat there were more \"wrong\" cases with Mr. von Osten as subject than\r\nwith the other questioners is to be explained by the fact that the\r\ndecisive movements were far less easily observed in this case, than in\r\nthat of the other questioners. (See page 49.) We expect that Series III\r\nwould show the same results, or approximately the same results in the\r\ncase of Mr. von Osten that it did for Mr. Pfungst and Mr. Schillings,\r\nbut unfortunately he declined to act as subject. In the meantime,\r\nhowever, new and decisive proof presented itself which destroyed all\r\npossible doubt.\r\n\r\nBefore adverting to it, let us consider in a few words the reaction-time\r\nof the horse,--the time elapsing between the final sign of the\r\nquestioner and the reaction of the horse (i. e., the back-step).\r\nUnfortunately this time cannot be directly determined. All that can be\r\nascertained from our time-measurements, is the time intervening between\r\nthe moment of the head-jerk and the moment in which the reaction of the\r\nhorse is noted. (See page 51). This time averaged, for the 127\r\nmeasurements, .45 seconds. If we stated the unavoidable error, (obtained\r\non the basis of extended supplementary measurements which it is not\r\nnecessary to consider here) as .15 seconds, and apply it to the value\r\nfound above, we obtain .3 seconds as the probable reaction-time of the\r\nhorse.[K]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote K: See page 126 on the corresponding reaction-time in the\r\n    case of man. Similar tests have been made in the case of animals in\r\n    only one instance, and that for dogs, by E. W. Weyer.[5] But, as\r\n    might have been expected, they did not yield any satisfactory\r\n    results.]\r\n\r\nThat the tapping--as well as all other movements of the horse--was\r\nnothing other than a reaction upon certain visual stimuli, was proved\r\nbeyond a doubt by the fact that the voluntary execution of the head-jerk\r\nand of other movements--which we will describe in more detail later\r\non,--brought about all the proper responses on the part of the horse.\r\nThus, artificial synthesis became the test of the correctness of\r\nanalytical observation.\r\n\r\nTo elucidate; if the questioner retained the erect position he elicited\r\nno response from the horse, say what he would. If, however, he stooped\r\nover slightly, Hans would immediately begin to tap, whether or not he\r\nhad been asked a question. It seems almost ridiculous that this should\r\nnever have been noticed before, but it is easily understood, for as soon\r\nas the questioner gave the problem he bent forward--be it ever so\r\nslightly--in order to observe the horse's foot the more closely, for the\r\nfoot was the horse's organ of speech. Hans would invariably begin to tap\r\nwhen I stooped to jot down some note I wished to make. Even to lower the\r\nhead a little was sufficient to elicit a response, even though the body\r\nitself might remain completely erect. Of thirty tests made in this\r\nposition, twenty-nine were successful. Hans would continue to tap until\r\nthe questioner again resumed a completely erect posture. If, for\r\ninstance, I stooped forward after having told the horse to tap 13, and\r\nif I purposely remained in this position until I had counted 20, he\r\nwould, without any hesitation, tap 20. If I asked him to add 3 and 4,\r\nbut did not move until 14 was reached, he would tap 14. Twenty-six such\r\ntests gave similar results.\r\n\r\nThe reaction of the horse upon such a signal for stopping showed slight\r\nmodifications according to the time which elapsed between the last tap\r\nand the signal for stopping. These modifications, which had hitherto\r\nbeen paraded as expressions of the horse's psychical power may be\r\nillustrated by the following schematic figures (Figures 1-4). In all of\r\nthem the dotted line _c-d_ represents the ground level; _d_ shows where\r\nthe horse's right forefoot was located before he began tapping; _a_ and\r\n_c_, respectively, indicate the place to which the foot is lowered\r\nduring the process of tapping. The unbroken line gives the direction of\r\nthe back-step.\r\n\r\nIf Hans, having raised his foot from _a_ to _b_--preparatory to\r\ntapping,--receives the signal at or just before the moment he lowers the\r\nfoot, he immediately swings it in a wide circle from _c_ back to its\r\noriginal position at _d_, (Fig. 1). As a matter of fact _a_ and _c_\r\ncoincide, but are juxtaposed in the diagram for the sake of schematic\r\nutility. This was the usual form of the back-step.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nIf the signal for stopping is given a little after the last tap (Fig.\r\n2), i. e., at the time that the foot is already being raised for another\r\ntap, then the back-step occurs as _a-b-d_. The horse thus gives, at the\r\nmoment it receives the signal for stopping, a changed impulse to the\r\nmoving foot. The curve, therefore, has a kink at _b_, and the back-step\r\noccurs with seeming hesitancy,--Hans appears not quite certain of his\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIf the signal be given somewhat later still (Fig. 3), i. e., when the\r\nfoot is being lowered to complete a tap, Hans is still able to put on\r\nthe brakes--as it were--and draw back his foot before it reaches the\r\nground. The whole process gives the impression that the horse was just\r\nabout to make a \"mistake\" of one unit, but at the last moment had\r\nbethought himself of the correct answer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nFinally, if the signal be deferred still longer, it becomes impossible\r\nto prevent the extra tap. The back-step again has the same form as in\r\nfigure 1; Hans has made a \"mistake\" in his answer by one unit too many.\r\n\r\nConversely, if the head-jerk of the questioner occurs too soon; i. e.,\r\nat the moment the horse has raised his foot for the final tap to the\r\nheight _b_, (Fig. 4), then the tap is not completed,--but the foot,\r\nwithout touching the ground, makes the curve _b c_{2} d_, back to its\r\noriginal position. Hans has again made a \"mistake\" in his answer,--this\r\ntime by one unit too few.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nAll these variations go to show one thing: Hans never knows in advance\r\nwhich tap is to be the final one. These variations in his reactions\r\noccurred often without having been intended by the questioner. But to\r\nbring them about at will required skill, on account of the shortness of\r\nthe time involved in the reaction.\r\n\r\nWhenever the signal for stopping--which we have just discussed--was\r\nfollowed by the complete erection of the head and trunk, Hans would\r\ndefinitely cease tapping. If, however, the questioner failed to assume a\r\ncompletely erect position, or if he stooped forward ever so slightly,\r\nthe horse would follow the back-step of the right foot with an extra tap\r\nof the left foot. Besides occurring in tests in which Mr. von Osten\r\nassumed the role of questioner, this fact was also noted when the Count\r\nzu Castell and Mr. Schillings acted as subjects. Since the extra tap\r\njust mentioned was not given like the others with the right foot\r\nforward, but with the left foot upon the spot, it was possible for the\r\nhorse to execute it with a greater show of energy. This simulated a high\r\ndegree of mental certainty on the part of the horse, as if he wished to\r\nindicate that this was the correct solution of the problem and it would\r\nhave to stand. In spite of all this, many errors would creep in. It was\r\npossible to prolong this extra tap and thus make it appear more\r\ndilatory. We need hardly add that henceforth it was within the power of\r\nthe experimenter to have the tapping executed entirely with the right\r\nfoot or with the final extra tap of the left foot. Hitherto the view had\r\nbeen current that this lay solely within the pleasure of the horse.\r\n\r\nIf the questioner still inclined forward, still remained in the bent\r\nposture after Hans had given the final tap with his left foot, the horse\r\nwould immediately begin to tap once more with his right foot, which had,\r\nin the meantime, become ready for further action. If the head jerk was\r\nthen made, Hans would bring his right foot back, give the extra tap with\r\nhis left foot, then resume tapping with the right and thus continue\r\nuntil the questioner once more resumed the erect posture. Thus the horse\r\non one occasion when I wished him to tap 100, gave--contrary to my\r\ndesire--the following response; 39 with the right foot, 1 with the left,\r\n24 with the right, 1 with the left, 35 with the right, and 1 with the\r\nleft. Later it became possible for me to cause him to tap 1 right, 1\r\nleft, 1 right, 1 left, etc. I could even get him to tap exclusively with\r\nthe left foot by standing at his left rather than at his right as had\r\nbeen customary with his questioners. These taps with the left foot were\r\nexecuted in a far less elegant fashion than those with the right foot,\r\nand with a great waste of energy. Hans had become a right-handed\r\nindividual--as it were--as a result of long habit.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the distance at which the experimenter directed the\r\nhorse, the following may be said: The usual distance was one-quarter to\r\none-half meter. This holds for all tests hitherto described. Seventy\r\ntests which were made for the purpose of discovering the influence of\r\nchange in distance showed that the reaction of the horse upon the\r\ncustomary signal of the head-jerk was accurate up to a distance of three\r\nand one-half meters. At a distance of three and one-half to four meters\r\nthere suddenly occurred a fall of 60-70% in the number of correct\r\nresponses. At a distance of four to four and one-half meters only\r\none-third of the responses were correct, and at a distance beyond four\r\nand one-half meters there were no correct responses. The greater number\r\nof these tests were made in our presence by Mr. von Osten, who was under\r\nthe impression that we were testing the accuracy of the horse's hearing,\r\nwhereas we were really testing the accuracy of his perception of\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the different positions which the experimenter might\r\nassume with reference to the horse, the following may be noted: The\r\nnormal position was to the right of the horse. If the experimenter stood\r\nimmediately in front of Hans, the latter's reaction would be just as\r\naccurate, though he would always turn his head and make desperate\r\nefforts to see the questioner, even though he was held in short by the\r\nreins. When a position immediately behind the horse was taken--a\r\nsomewhat dangerous proceeding, since Hans would at once begin to\r\nkick--no response could be obtained until he succeeded in turning far\r\nenough around to get the questioner within view. If he was restrained\r\nfrom turning completely around, he would at least turn his head,--and\r\nalways to the right. One might even turn his back upon Hans during the\r\ntests, for the signal for stopping was not obtained from the face of the\r\nquestioner, but from a movement of the head. The following incident will\r\nshow to what extent the horse had become accustomed to seeing the\r\nquestioner in a certain definite position. For a long time I had been\r\nin the habit--without exception--of standing close to the horse's\r\nshoulder. Mr. von Osten, on the other hand, would stand farther back.\r\nWhen, on a certain day, I assumed the latter position, the horse would\r\nnot suffer it, but would move backward until he had his accustomed view\r\nof me.\r\n\r\nFinally we sought to discover by what movements the horse could be made\r\nto cease tapping. We discovered that upward movements served as signals\r\nfor stopping. The raising of the head was the most effective, though the\r\nraising of the eyebrows, or the dilation of the nostrils--as in a\r\nsneer--seemed also to be efficacious. However, it was impossible for me\r\nto discover whether or not these latter movements were accompanied by\r\nsome slight, involuntary upward movement of the head. The upward\r\nmovement of the head was ineffective only when it did not occur as a\r\njerk, but was executed in a circuitous form,--first upward and then back\r\nagain. Such a movement was occasionally observed in the case of Mr. von\r\nOsten. The elevation of the arms or of the elbow nearest the horse, or\r\nthe elevation of the entire body was also effective. Even if a placard,\r\nwith which the experimenter tried to cover his face, were raised at a\r\ngiven moment, the horse would make the back-step. On the other hand,\r\nhead movements to the right and to the left or forward and back, in\r\nfine, all horizontal movements, remained ineffective. We also found that\r\nall hand movements, including the \"wonderfully effective thrust of the\r\nhand into the pocket filled with carrots\", brought no response. I might\r\nalso change my position and walk forward and then backward some distance\r\nbehind the horse, but the back-step would only occur in response to the\r\ncharacteristic stimulus. After what has been said it is easy to\r\nunderstand how vain were Mr. Schillings' attempts to disturb the horse\r\nand how naturally he might conclude that Hans was not influenced by\r\nvisual signs. Mr. Schillings simply did not know which signs were\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nWhile the horse could thus be interrupted in the process of tapping by\r\nmovements which were executed at the level of the questioner's head, yet\r\nmovements below this level had the opposite effect. If Hans showed that\r\nhe was about to cease tapping before it was desired, it was possible to\r\ncause him to continue by simply bending forward a trifle more. The\r\ngreater angle at which the questioner's trunk was now inclined caused\r\nthe horse to increase the rate of tapping. The rule may be stated thus:\r\nThe greater the angle at which the body inclined forward, the greater\r\nthe horse's rate of tapping, and _vice versa_. It was noticeable that\r\nwhenever Mr. von Osten asked for a relatively large number--in which\r\ncase he always bent farther forward than in the case of smaller\r\nnumbers--Hans would immediately begin to tap very swiftly. Not being\r\nentirely satisfied with these observations, the following more exact\r\nmeasurements were taken. I asked the horse to tap 20. From 1 to 10 I\r\nheld my body at a certain constant angle, at 10 I suddenly bent farther\r\nforward and retained this posture until 20 had been reached. If there\r\nexisted a relationship between the angle of inclination and the rate of\r\ntapping, then the time for the last ten taps ought to be less than for\r\nthe first ten. Of 34 such tests 31 were sucessful. The following are two\r\nspecimen series.\r\n\r\nThe first series consisted of ten tests of 15 taps each. In all cases my\r\nhead was bent at an angle of 30 deg. to the axis of the trunk, but I\r\nconstantly changed the angle of inclination of the trunk. It was not\r\npossible to measure this angle accurately on account of the rapidity\r\nwith which the whole test had to be made. I was able, however, to\r\ndifferentiate between them with enough accuracy to designate the\r\nsmallest angle (about 20 deg.) as belonging to Grade I, and the greatest\r\nangle (about 100 deg.) as belonging to Grade VII. By fixing certain points\r\nin the environment, it was possible to get approximately the same angle\r\nrepeatedly. The time from the third to the thirteenth tap was, in all\r\ncases, taken by Prof. Stumpf by means of a stop-watch. The tests were\r\ntaken in the following order:\r\n\r\n  Grade of inclination:   I   VI   II   II   IV   V    VI   VII\r\n  Time for 10 taps:      5.2  4.6  5.0  5.0  4.8  4.8  4.6  4.4 sec.\r\n\r\nFrom this series it will be seen that in the case of the same angle of\r\ninclination (II and VI were repeated and III was omitted) the same rate\r\nobtained in the tapping. In two other tests I constantly increased the\r\nangle of inclination during the 15 taps, and Hans gradually increased\r\nthe rate of tapping accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn a second series I had the horse tap 14, five times. I myself took the\r\ntime of the taps up to 7 by means of the stop-watch, while Prof. Stumpf\r\ntook the time of the taps from 8 to 13. At 8 I suddenly bent forward a\r\nlittle more and retained this position until tap 13. The results were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Taps 2 to 7  (Pf.): 3.2  2.2-2.4  2.4  2.2-2.4  2.4 seconds.\r\n   \"   8 to 13 (St.): 2.6    2.0    2.0    2.2    2.2 seconds.\r\n\r\nSuch good results, however, were possible only after a number of\r\npreliminary practice tests had been made. The experiment was especially\r\ndifficult because the horse was often on the point of stopping in the\r\nmidst of a test. This was probably due to some unintentional movement\r\non my part. In such cases I could induce him to continue tapping only by\r\nbending forward still more, but this effected also, as we have seen, an\r\nincrease in his rate of tapping. Such tests, of course, could not give\r\nunambiguous results.\r\n\r\nThe rate of tapping was quite independent of my rate of counting. Thus,\r\nif I counted aloud rapidly, but bent forward only very slightly, the\r\nhorse's tapping was slow and lagged behind my count. If I counted slowly\r\nbut bent far forward, Hans would tap rapidly and advance beyond my\r\ncount. Thus we see that his rate of tapping was in accordance with the\r\ndegree of inclination of my body and never in accordance with the rate\r\nof my counting, i. e., it was quite independent of every sort of\r\nauditory stimulation.\r\n\r\nDirect observation and a comparison of the records of the time Hans\r\nrequired in giving to his master responses involving small, medium and\r\nlarge numbers, with the records of the time which he required to respond\r\nto my questions when I bent only slightly, moderately or very far\r\nforward, proved that the increased rapidity in tapping in the case of\r\nlarge numbers, which many regarded as an evidence of high intelligence,\r\n(see page 20), was, as a matter of fact, brought about in the way\r\ndescribed. The two series (in each of which the time measured was for 10\r\ntaps) are quite in accord. The horse did not tap faster because he had\r\nbeen given a large number by Mr. von Osten, but because the latter had\r\nbent farther forward.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it readily appears why it was possible to cause Hans to\r\nincrease his rate of tapping but not to decrease it. To do the latter\r\nwould involve a decrease in the angle of inclination of the body. This\r\nwould necessitate the erection of the body. As we have seen, this was\r\nthe signal to which Hans reacted by ceasing to tap. And as a matter of\r\nfact we never knew the horse to decrease his rate of tapping in the\r\ncourse of any single test, except in the case of very large numbers, and\r\nthen it was probably due to fatigue. Mr. von Osten insisted that Hans\r\noften slowed down toward the end of a test, \"in order to obviate\r\nmistakes\", but all the tests in which he tried to demonstrate this to\r\nus, were unsuccessful. In spite of all exhortation, Hans would tap\r\neither uniformly or somewhat more rapidly as soon as his master--in all\r\nprobability unconsciously--bent somewhat lower. Only once was such a\r\ntest successful. Mr. von Osten--upon our request--asked the horse to\r\ngive a certain large number. In this instance the decrease in the rate\r\nof tapping was due to fatigue and had nothing whatever to do with the\r\ndesire on the part of the horse to avoid error. Furthermore, Mr. Hahn,\r\nwho had visited Hans twenty times and had made careful notes of his\r\nobservations, corroborated my statement when he said that he himself\r\nnever noted the decrease in rate mentioned. Contrary statements may\r\nperhaps be due to the fact that the tense state of expectancy on the\r\npart of the observer made the interval between the last taps appear\r\nsubjectively somewhat longer.\r\n\r\nSo much for the technique of the tapping. Now a word about the numbers\r\nwhich Hans tapped. (I refer only to the results obtained in series which\r\ninvolved no volitional control). The number 1 was very difficult to get.\r\nHans usually tapped 2 instead. Thus even in the case of Mr. von Osten he\r\nresponded five times with 2, and only in the sixth test did he react\r\ncorrectly. As far as other questioners were concerned, 1 was seldom\r\never obtained, except in the case of Mr. Schillings and myself. The\r\nnumbers 2, 3 and 4, on the other hand, were very easily obtained and,\r\nabove all, 3 seldom failed. 3 seemed to be the horse's favorite number\r\nand was very frequently given instead of other numbers. Thus, one-sixth\r\nof all the horse's incorrect responses which were given to me were in\r\nterms of the number 3. The numbers 5 and 6 were a little more difficult\r\nto obtain and above 10 the difficulty increased rapidly. Indeed, I never\r\nsaw Hans respond with a number exceeding 20 to any questioner, Mr.\r\nSchillings and Mr. von Osten excepted. I saw the nine vain attempts of\r\nCount zu Castell to get the number 15, and Count Matuschka's eight\r\nunsuccessful attempts to obtain the number 16 as a response. But even\r\nwith Mr. von Osten and Mr. Schillings such failures were not infrequent.\r\nThus, Mr. von Osten tried five consecutive times to obtain the number\r\n24. I myself did not fare any better at first. But the following table\r\nshows what practice can do. If we compare the percentage of correct\r\nresponses (involving the numbers 1 to 7--for which alone I have\r\nsufficient material, viz., 80 to 100 cases), obtained in the first half\r\nof our tests, with that of the second half, we get the following:\r\n\r\n  For number:             1    2    3    4    5    6    7\r\n  In first half of tests: 49,  92,  89,  86,  74,  62,  53%\r\n  \"  second  \"  \"    \"  : 92,  95,  92,  98,  97,  86,  96%\r\n\r\nFrom this we see how hard it was at first to get the number 1 and that\r\nfailure was as frequent as success, and how much easier it was on the\r\nother hand to get the numbers 2 and 3 (and which, therefore, do not show\r\nany great improvement in the second half of the tests). Beyond the 3 the\r\npercentage of correct responses decreased and the number 7 stood at the\r\nsame level as the number 1. In the second half of the tests, all these\r\ndifferences disappeared and errors were infrequent and seldom exceeded\r\n+1 or -1. These results of practice are not to be accredited to the\r\nhorse, but to the experimenter, who was at first quite unskilled. This\r\ndifference in results does not appear in the case of Mr. von Osten, for\r\nhis initial practice had been had many years previous. The values\r\nobtained in his case were very constant throughout our experimentation\r\nand generally showed something like 90% of correct responses. To be\r\nsure, in his case also, the number 1 was somewhat unfavorable, (79% were\r\ncorrect responses). But the percentages obtained in his case showed no\r\nimprovement whatever throughout our experimentation. We need scarcely\r\nadd that with the voluntary control of the giving of the signs, in the\r\ncase at least of such small numbers as are here discussed, no errors,\r\nwhatever, occurred.\r\n\r\nWe have discussed the influence of the experimenter, i. e., the one who\r\nasked the horse to tap; now let us consider the influence of others\r\npresent upon the horse.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, other persons had no effect upon the horse's\r\nresponses. This appears from the failure of nearly all tests in which\r\nall of those present--with the exception of the questioner himself--knew\r\nthe number which the horse was to tap. Even when the others concentrated\r\ntheir whole attention upon the number, it profited little as a close\r\nanalysis of the 136 cases, which belong under this head in our records,\r\ngo to prove. Thus, in the presence of a group of twenty interested\r\npersons--during the absence of Mr. von Osten--twenty-one problems were\r\ngiven to the horse, the solutions of which were known to everyone but\r\nmyself, the questioner. Result: only two correct responses. Only when\r\nthere was among the spectators someone to whom the horse was accustomed\r\nto respond or one from whom he regularly received his food, would such\r\nan influence be effective.[L] But such cases were few. The most\r\nimportant were the following: I at one time whispered a number to Hans\r\n(on the occasion of the tests mentioned on page 37), and Mr. von Osten\r\nasked for it the moment I stepped aside. Hans answered incorrectly even\r\nthough I stood close beside Mr. von Osten; I did not, however, think\r\nintently of the number. As soon as I concentrated my attention upon the\r\nnumber he promptly responded correctly. Further cases are those\r\nmentioned on page 38, in which the keeper of the horse unintentionally\r\naided in giving four dates which were unknown to all others present,\r\nincluding the questioner. This single instance shows the necessity of\r\nthe rule that during tests in which the method is that of procedure\r\nwithout knowledge the solutions should be known to no one of those\r\npresent. Finally the tests made by the September-Commission and reported\r\nin Supplement III (page 255) may possibly belong under this head. Since\r\nthey were not followed out any further, I am unable to render a definite\r\njudgment upon them. In most of these tests the question itself, as put\r\nby Mr. von Osten, was not adequately answered, but curiously enough,\r\nhowever, the number which had been given to Hans in von Osten's absence\r\nand which formed the initial number of some mathematical operation, was\r\ntapped correctly. This may possibly be explained by the assumption that\r\nthis initial number had been retained in the memory of some of those\r\npresent, (see page 149, on the \"perseverative tendency\"), and that the\r\nhorse, since he had been working with some of them, responded to one of\r\nthose present. Chance may have played some part also.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote L: Mr. Schillings, however, did succeed in making a number\r\n    of tests with the co-operation of others who had never before worked\r\n    with the horse. These tests were made under the following\r\n    conditions: The horse was standing in his stall, when Mr. Schillings\r\n    and another gentleman approached him. There was no one else present.\r\n    Mr. Schillings, who tried to remain as passive inwardly, as\r\n    possible, asked his partner to think consecutively of different\r\n    numbers between one and 20, which thus were known to him alone. Hans\r\n    was then commanded by Mr. Schillings to tap the numbers, which he\r\n    did, to the great astonishment of the men, and especially of Mr.\r\n    Schillings. In like manner Mr. Sander, a staff physician in the\r\n    marine, received--so he writes me--three correct responses to four\r\n    questions which he put to the horse. It happened also in the case of\r\n    two scientific men and finally, too, in my own case when I first\r\n    came in contact with the horse, (see page 88). The horse's reaction\r\n    was brought about in the same way in every one of these instances.\r\n    Mr. Schillings, in bending forward slightly, thereby started the\r\n    horse a-tapping, and his companion--just as innocently--interrupted\r\n    the process by means of a movement of his head, when the right\r\n    number of taps was reached.\r\n\r\n    I later tried similar experiments together with Mr. Hahn. I was\r\n    aware of the answer to the riddle at the time, but he was not. Mr.\r\n    Hahn stepped in front of the horse and thought intently of certain\r\n    numbers. I did the questioning, that is, I got the horse to tap. In\r\n    twelve tests Hans responded correctly in only two instances. In the\r\n    ten others he always tapped beyond the number Mr. Hahn had in mind,\r\n    e.g., 21 instead of 2, and was evidently awaiting a movement on my\r\n    part. When we exchanged roles, Mr. Hahn doing the questioning and I\r\n    doing the \"thinking,\" the horse would not respond at all, although\r\n    as a rule Mr. Hahn had been fairly successful in working with him\r\n    alone. I had gradually gained so much influence over the horse, that\r\n    he would scarcely attend to any one else when I was about--Mr. von\r\n    Osten hardly excepted.\r\n\r\n    In this connection I would prefer to avoid the term \"rapport,\" which\r\n    may rise in the minds of many, since it has been used so much in\r\n    connection with the phenomena of hypnotism, for I would not obscure\r\n    a fact that is clear by giving it a name that is vague.]\r\n\r\nIf the questioner knew the number of taps desired, (which was not the\r\ncase with the tests hitherto discussed), then the environment had still\r\nless influence upon the horse--except that it caused occasional\r\ninterruption. The horse's responses, therefore, did not tend to become\r\nmore successful just because a number of persons were simultaneously\r\nconcentrating upon the result desired. This was proven by the\r\nexperiments which we repeatedly made for this purpose. Only one person\r\nat a time had any influence upon Hans. If two questioners tried to\r\ninfluence the horse at the same time,--other conditions being the\r\nsame,--success would be for the one who had the greater control over the\r\nanimal when working alone with him. Prof. Stumpf and I made the\r\nfollowing experiment. Both of us stood to the right of the horse, each\r\nthinking of a number. In ten such tests Hans always tapped my number.\r\nWhen Stumpf concentrated upon 5 and I upon 8, the horse responded with\r\n8, i. e., the larger number. When Stumpf had 7 in mind, and I had 4, the\r\nresponse would be 4, i. e., the smaller number. When Stumpf thought of\r\nnumber 6, and I had fixed upon none, Hans tapped 35. He was evidently\r\nawaiting my signal. When I went away Stumpf again demanded the number 6,\r\nand the horse responded properly. When I returned, Stumpf's attempts\r\nagain failed. On another occasion Count Matuschka put a number of\r\nquestions, while Mr. von Osten stood behind him. All of the horse's\r\nresponses were correct, even the one answering the question: \"How much\r\nis 7 times 7?\", which was difficult on account of the great number of\r\ntaps required. I was able to note from the direction of the horse's eyes\r\nthat he was attending only to his master and not to the Count. On still\r\nanother occasion Mr. Grabow sang two tones--the second being the fourth\r\nof the first--and asked Hans: \"How many intervals lie between?\" I was\r\nstanding erect before the horse, and was thinking intently of the\r\nnumber 2, but without giving any voluntary sign of any sort. Hans tapped\r\n2, whereupon Mr. Grabow put a number of similar questions; but I no\r\nlonger thought of the answers, and all of Hans's responses went wrong.\r\n\r\nAlthough Hans was not influenced by others so long as a suitable\r\nexperimenter was present, yet he might be disturbed and under certain\r\nconditions might be led to make the back-step in response to certain\r\nmovements in his environment. The person to whom he responded would have\r\nto be close to the experimenter and would necessarily have to execute a\r\nmovement greater in extent than the experimenter's. In such instances\r\nthe raising of the head, arm or trunk, was a sufficient stimulus. Thus\r\nwe made the following two series of tests. Mr. Stumpf stood with trunk\r\nbent forward before the horse, and at a moment decided upon beforehand,\r\nassumed an erect position. I myself stood beside Hans and asked him to\r\ntap. When I stood at the horse's neck, then Mr. Stumpfs interruption was\r\neffective. When I stood at the horse's flank, the interruption effected\r\nonly a seeming hesitation, and when I moved still farther back, the\r\nhorse continued to tap despite any attempted disturbance. In the second\r\nseries the questioner remained constantly at the right shoulder of the\r\nhorse, while the one who attempted to distract him, changed positions.\r\nWhen the latter stood to the right immediately in front of or beside the\r\nquestioner, the disturbance was effective in 10 out of 13 cases. But\r\nwhen he stood back of, and to the right of, the questioner, the attempts\r\nat disturbance were seldom successful. If he chose a place before and to\r\nthe left of the horse, there was hardly any distraction (in 4 cases\r\nonly, out of 13), and if he stood to the left and behind the animal, he\r\nexerted no influence whatever. Hans manifestly turned his attention,\r\nalmost exclusively, to the side at which the questioner stood.\r\n\r\nThat knowledge of this _modus operandi_ made it possible for those\r\npersons to get responses from the horse, who hitherto had been\r\nunsuccessful, is shown in the case of Mr. Stumpf when he began to\r\ncontrol his movements voluntarily on the basis of observations which had\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II. Problems which Hans solved by movements of the head._\r\n\r\nWe are here concerned with the horse's head movements upward, downward,\r\nto the right and to the left, and also with nodding and shaking of the\r\nhead to signify \"yes\" and \"no\". We soon discovered that these\r\nexperiments, also, were successful without an oral statement of the\r\nproblem,--in other words, the auditory stimulus was quite superfluous.\r\nThe tests with the blinders showed that Hans was lost as soon as his\r\nquestioner was out of his view, but responded adequately the moment the\r\nquestioner was in sight. Hans, therefore, had established no idea of any\r\nsort in connection with the terms \"up\", \"down\", etc., but in these\r\ncases, likewise, he reacted in response to certain visual stimuli. The\r\nnature of these stimuli I discovered at first in my observations of Mr.\r\nvon Osten and also of myself, when working with the horse.\r\n\r\nAbove all things it was necessary that the questioner, during these\r\ntests, should stand perfectly erect. If he stooped ever so slightly, the\r\ntest was unsuccessful. If he carefully refrained from any movement\r\nwhatsoever, and looking straight before him asked the horse, \"Which\r\ndirection is right?\" or \"Which way is upward?\", Hans would execute all\r\nsorts of head movements without rhyme or reason. It was evident that he\r\nnoted that a head movement of some kind was expected of him, but did not\r\nknow the particular one that was wanted. But if the questioner now\r\nraised his head, Hans would begin to nod and would continue doing so\r\nuntil the questioner lowered his head. This reaction was interpreted as\r\nsignifying \"yes\". Mr. von Osten had always asked Hans before each of the\r\nmore difficult tests whether he had comprehended the meaning of the\r\nproblem, and was reassured only upon seeing the horse's affirmative\r\nresponse. But contrary to Mr. von Osten's expectation, Hans also\r\nresponded in this manner after a pair of ear-caps had been drawn over\r\nhis ears. In the case of the tests described at the beginning of the\r\nchapter, in which the method was that of \"procedure without knowledge\",\r\nMr. von Osten had always insisted that we await Hans's nod of\r\ncomprehension before proceeding. We complied; Hans nodded and--regularly\r\ndisgraced himself!\r\n\r\nWhen the questioner raised his head somewhat higher than normal, Hans\r\nwould throw his own upward, which was supposed to signify \"upward\". A\r\nlowering of the head on the part of the questioner was followed by a\r\nlowering on the part of Hans, which was his form of response for \"down\".\r\nFor some time I was in a quandary as to the difference between the\r\nquestioner's signal for this latter response and the one which was the\r\nsignal for the horse to begin tapping, although I had often given both\r\nkinds unwittingly. Further experiments showed that Hans responded with a\r\nnod of the head whenever the questioner, while bending forward, chanced\r\nto stand in front of, or to the side of the horse's head, but that he\r\nwould begin to tap in response to the same signal, as soon as the\r\nexperimenter stood farther back. The difference in the two signals,\r\ntherefore, was very slight, and I repeatedly noted that instead of\r\ntapping, as he had been requested, Hans would respond to the Count zu\r\nCastell's and Mr. Schillings' questions by a nod of the head.\r\n\r\nIf, while standing in the customary position to the right of and facing\r\nthe horse, the questioner would turn his head a little to the right--a\r\nmovement which, when seen from the horse's position, would appear to be\r\nto the left,--Hans would turn his head to his left. But if on the other\r\nhand the questioner would turn slightly to the left,--i. e. seen from\r\nthe horse's position, to the right,--then Hans would turn his head to\r\nhis right. And finally, whenever the questioner turned his head first to\r\nthe right, then to the left, Hans would respond by turning first to his\r\nleft, then to his right. This, according to Mr. von Osten, signified\r\n\"zero\" or \"no\". Since this movement could not be executed by the\r\nexperimenter while in a stooping position, it can now readily be seen\r\nwhy it was that Hans, instead of shaking his head, always began to tap\r\nwhenever a placard with \"O\" upon it, was shown to him in the course of\r\nthe experiments in which the method was procedure without knowledge on\r\nthe part of the questioner. The latter expected the horse to tap, and\r\ntherefore bent forward. Like all of the horse's other forms of response,\r\nthis, too, was always unsuccessful whenever the questioner stepped\r\nbehind the animal. Although Hans had always responded to Mr. von Osten\r\nand Mr. Schillings, and at first also to me, by means of the stereotyped\r\nmovement of the head to the right and then to the left to signify \"zero\"\r\nor \"no\", I later succeeded in controlling my signals so as to get the\r\ninverted order in the horse's response. In the case of Mr. Schillings\r\nand of Mr. von Osten all of the movements just described were very\r\nminute, and long after the movements, which were effective stimuli for\r\nreleasing the process of tapping, were recognized, it was still\r\nexceedingly difficult to discover them in these two gentlemen. The\r\nsignal for \"zero\" and \"no\" was relatively the most pronounced of the\r\ngroup in the case of Mr. von Osten, while with Mr. Schillings it was the\r\nleast pronounced, in comparison with his very strong \"jerk\". Yet in both\r\ncases Hans responded with absolute certainty.\r\n\r\nIt is now readily conceivable how it was possible to make the horse\r\nrespond to all sorts of foolish questions, both by involuntary signs--i.\r\ne., expressions following upon the bare imaging of the response\r\nexpected,--as well as by means of controlled signs. One could thus\r\nobtain consecutively the answers \"yes\" and \"no\" to the same question. Or\r\none might ask: \"Hans, where is your head?\", and Hans would bend to the\r\nearth. \"And where are your legs?\" He would look at the skies. Etc.\r\n\r\nLet us examine for a moment the directives which the horse required for\r\nthe various positions. If one called him, while he was running about the\r\ncourtyard, he paid no attention whatever, but if one beckoned to him, he\r\ncame immediately. A raising of the hand brought him to a standstill. If\r\none now stepped forward or pointed one's hand in that direction, he\r\nwould step forward, or _vice versa_, he would step backward. By means of\r\nminimal movements of the head, of the arm nearest the horse, or of the\r\nwhole body, Hans could be induced to assume the position one desired,\r\nwithout touching him or speaking a word. I noticed this quite early in\r\nthe course of the investigation. Once, when intending to ask the horse\r\nto step backward to the right, I inadvertently said \"Step backward to\r\nthe left!\", whereupon he stepped backward to the right. In spite of my\r\nverbal error, I had involuntarily given him the proper directives.\r\n\r\nFinally we may note that Mr. von Osten had occasionally asked the horse\r\nto jump or to rear. The command in this case was: \"Jump\", or the\r\nquestion was: \"What do the horses do in the circus?\". Since these tests\r\nwere just as effective when the command was given silently, it was an\r\nindication that these, too, depended upon visual stimuli. What was\r\nnecessary to cause the horse to step backward and then jump forward was\r\nto step backward oneself, or make a slight movement of the hand in that\r\ndirection. If one wished to make him rear, it might be effected by\r\nthrowing the arm or head slightly upward.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III. Problems which Hans solved by approaching the objects to be\r\ndesignated._\r\n\r\nThe method pursued in these tests was the following: From five to eight\r\npieces of colored cloth 1/2 x 1/4 meters in size were arranged in\r\nchanging series upon the ground, the interval between them being equal\r\nto the width of one piece, or else they were hung upon a string a man's\r\nheight above the ground. This method was also employed when placards of\r\nlike size with written symbols were used. The horse stood ten paces away\r\nand opposite the middle of the series, while Mr. von Osten stood at his\r\nright. Hans was asked to go and point out the cloth of a certain color\r\nor the placard with a certain word upon it. If the cloth lay upon the\r\nground, Hans picked it up with his mouth and carried it to the\r\nquestioner. If the cloth, like the placards, hung from the cord, he\r\napproached, pointed it out with his nose and then backed up to his\r\noriginal position. Before approaching the objects, Hans was required to\r\nindicate, by tapping, the number of the place in the series (counting\r\nfrom left to right), which the cloth or placard occupied. Mr. von Osten\r\nnever omitted this requirement. Then the command \"Go!\" was given, and\r\nHans obeyed. (As a matter of fact, a slight directive movement of the\r\nhead or hand was just as effective as the spoken command).\r\n\r\nThe following cases, chosen in a haphazard fashion, show that the\r\nhorse's indication of the object's place in the series, by means of\r\ntapping, was by no means a guarantee that he would point it out\r\ncorrectly. Five placards hung from the cord. Mr. von Osten asked: \"What\r\nis the position, counting from left to right, of the placard which has\r\nthe word 'aber' inscribed upon it?\". Hans answered: 3. (It was indeed\r\nthe middle placard.) Then he was commanded: \"Go!\". Thereupon Hans went\r\nstraight to the fourth placard. On another occasion Hans happened to\r\ndrop a brown cloth upon a black one. His master asked him: \"In which\r\nplace are there two cloths?\". Hans responded correctly, \"In the second\r\nplace\". To the question \"Which of the two is the black one?\" he also\r\nanswered rightly: \"The lower one\". Upon being asked to get it, he\r\nbrought the white cloth.\r\n\r\nThe large number and the irregularities of the errors showed that there\r\nwas no manner of intelligence involved in the pointing out process. Thus\r\nduring the two months of our experimentation Hans was asked twenty-five\r\ntimes by Mr. von Osten to bring the green cloth. Only six times did he\r\nsucceed in the first attempt, while in five instances he selected an\r\norange-colored cloth, four times a blue, three times a white one.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the errors were equally distributed over the tests with\r\nthe colored cloths and those with the placards is strong evidence that\r\nthe horse's response involved no intellectual process, for if that were\r\nthe case, then the responses in the tests with the placards would have\r\nbeen very much more difficult, for they would have involved the ability\r\nto read, whereas the tests with the colored cloths demanded only that a\r\nfew names be remembered. Nevertheless, the horse was as unsuccessful in\r\ntests of one kind as he was in those of the other,--even when Mr. von\r\nOsten acted as questioner. (50% failures in 78 placard tests; 46%\r\nfailures in 103 color tests.)\r\n\r\nThe fact that commands which were purposely enunciated poorly, or else\r\nnot spoken at all, were executed with just as much accuracy as those\r\ngiven aloud, strengthened us in our supposition. On one occasion I\r\nplaced a blank placard with the others. When I ordered him to approach\r\n_tabula rasa_, he invariably went to the right one. The following\r\nillustrates how he fulfilled quite nonsensical commands. A series of\r\nblue and green cloths lay upon the ground. Being asked where the black,\r\nthe orange, and the yellow cloths lay, Hans shook his head\r\nenergetically, i. e. they were not there. And yet, upon being asked to\r\nbring them in the order named, he regularly brought one of the blue\r\nones.\r\n\r\nAll this goes to show that Hans did not know the names of the colors (to\r\nsay nothing of the symbols on the placards). It was plain that here\r\nalso, as in all the other cases, he was controlled by signs made by the\r\nquestioner, the nature of which I soon discovered. Standing erect, Mr.\r\nvon Osten always turned head and trunk in the direction of the cloth or\r\nplacard desired. Hans, keeping his eye on his master, would proceed in\r\nthat direction. Even after he had already started out, thanks to his\r\nlarge visual field one could control his direction by turning slightly\r\nmore to the right or to the left. If, however, he had already arrived at\r\nthe row of placards or cloths, this method ceased to be effective, for\r\nthen he could no longer see the experimenter. It made no difference\r\nwhether the cloths lay on the ground, or were suspended, like the\r\nplacards.\r\n\r\nThe following fact justifies the conclusion that the bodily attitude of\r\nthe questioner was the effective signal. The more numerous the cloths,\r\nor the nearer they were placed together, the more difficult one would\r\nexpect it to be for the horse to select the one indicated by the\r\nexperimenter. Such was indeed the case, for the number of errors\r\nincreased with the number of cloths presented.\r\n\r\nBut no matter how many cloths there might be, or how closely they might\r\nbe placed, it was always possible to indicate either end of the row, for\r\nin that case one had merely to turn to the extreme left or the extreme\r\nright, and might even turn beyond the row. Hans seldom failed in these\r\ncases, whereas he made many errors when cloths or placards within the\r\nseries were wanted.\r\n\r\nTo turn from the nature and number of Hans's errors, to their\r\ndistribution,--observation proved the hypothesis that the nearer two\r\ncloths lay together, the greater was the chance of their being mistaken\r\none for the other. If we designate as \"error 1\" all those cases in which\r\nHans went to cloth II instead of to cloth I, cloth III instead of cloth\r\nII, to V instead of IV, etc., and as \"error 2\" when he mistook III for\r\nI, IV for II, in fine, whenever he went two places too far to the right\r\nor left, and as \"error 3\" whenever he went three places too far to\r\neither side of the cloth desired, we find the following grouping of\r\nerrors:\r\n\r\n  With Mr. von Osten, a total of 63 errors:\r\n           73%                      \"error 1\"\r\n           21%                      \"error 2\"\r\n            4%                      \"error 3\"\r\n            1%                      \"error 4\"\r\n            1%                      \"error 5\"\r\n\r\n  With Mr. Pfungst, a total of 64 errors:\r\n           68%                      \"error 1\"\r\n           20%                      \"error 2\"\r\n           11%                      \"error 3\"\r\n            1%                      \"error 4\"\r\n            0%                      \"error 5\".\r\n\r\nThe most frequently recurring error, therefore, was the one in which the\r\nhorse, instead of going to the cloth desired, approached the one\r\nimmediately adjacent. On page 79 I said that Hans's errors were without\r\nsystem, but only in so far as it was impossible to explain them on a\r\nbasis of the colors which seemingly were mistaken one for the other. A\r\npart of a series in which Mr. von Osten acted as questioner may serve as\r\nan illustration. The order given is that of the experimental series as\r\nit occurred. Five colored cloths were used.\r\n\r\n      Color of the cloth\r\n  asked for: blue,  brown,  brown, brown, brown,  brown, green, green.\r\n               |      |      |       |      |       |      |      |\r\n  brought:  orange, orange, green, green, yellow, green, blue, orange.\r\n\r\n      Place of cloth\r\n  asked for:   V     II     II     II     II     II     III     III\r\n               |      |      |      |      |      |      |        |\r\n  brought:    IV     IV    III    III      I    III      V       IV\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of this series which it would be hard to explain by a\r\nreference to the colors which were mistaken, is simply this: Cloths\r\nlying near together were regularly mistaken on the part of the horse.\r\n\r\nExperimental control of the questioner's movements decided the question.\r\nIf the questioner at first indicated the proper direction and then\r\nturned about after the horse had already started forward, he was as a\r\nrule misled. When the questioner did not face the cloths at all, but\r\nturned away at right angles, or when he turned his back upon them, Hans\r\nwas completely at sea. If, on the other hand, the cloths were arranged,\r\nnot in a row, but in several heaps, so that one might turn to a\r\nparticular heap, but could not indicate a particular cloth, then Hans\r\nwould regularly go to the proper heap, but would always bring forth the\r\nwrong cloth. After much persuasion Mr. von Osten consented to make a\r\nseries of these tests himself. Hans's failures were deplorable. He would\r\ntake up first one cloth then another, turn again to the first, etc. We\r\nwould mention, however, that this apparent searching was not done\r\nspontaneously, but in response to Mr. von Osten's calls, such as \"See\r\nthere!\", \"The blue!\", etc. Every time Mr. von Osten called, Hans would\r\ndrop the cloth he was holding in his mouth, or he would turn away from\r\nthe one he was about to grasp, and would then try another one.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these visual signs, the horse received auditory signals\r\nin these tests, (as in all others in which he was required to bring\r\nobjects). As soon as the questioner noticed that Hans was about to take\r\nup the wrong cloth, all that was necessary to make him correct his error\r\nwas to give some sort of an exclamation, such as \"Wrong!\", \"Look, you!\",\r\n\"Blue!\", etc. Hans would pass on as long as the calling continued. If\r\nhe was picking up, or about to pick up, a cloth when the exclamation was\r\nmade, he would go on to the next; but if, at the time he was on his way\r\nto a certain cloth, he would change his direction in response to the\r\ncall. If he stood before one of the pieces at the time, but had not\r\nlowered his head, he would pass on to the next. In all this he would\r\nadhere to a certain routine of procedure. If he was approaching a series\r\nfrom the right, then a call would cause him to turn to the left, if he\r\nwas coming from the left, he would turn to the right. If he had\r\napproached the row of cloths near the center, he would turn, in response\r\nto the questioner's calls, to the left,--seldom, very seldom, to the\r\nright. Mr. von Osten did not seem to be able to control the responses of\r\nthe horse, entirely. As a rule, but not always, one call sufficed to\r\nmake Hans pass on to the next cloth. If too many calls were given, he\r\nwould often go too far. Loud exclamations were superfluous.\r\n\r\nThese statements are not mere assertions, but are founded upon the\r\nrecords of the results. The tests in which calls were made show a larger\r\npercentage of correct responses than do those without calls. Of a total\r\nof 103 tests with colored cloths, which Mr. von Osten performed for us,\r\nonly 37% brought forth successful responses on the part of the horse\r\nwhen visual signs were the only directives and when there were no\r\ndirections by means of calls, whereas the total percentage of successful\r\nresponses was 54%, if we add to the above those in which the vocal\r\nexclamations helped to bring about success. The corresponding\r\npercentages for the total of 78 tests with the placards were 23% and\r\n50%. In a total of 110 color tests I myself obtained 31% correct\r\nresponses under the first head, and 56% under the second head. In a\r\ntotal of 59 tests with placards I succeeded in getting 31% correct\r\nresponses under the first head and 46% under the second head. We must\r\nnote that without verbal admonition only one-third of the tests brought\r\nforth correct responses, whereas one-half succeeded when those in which\r\ncalls were used, are added. Still, this is a relatively poor showing. In\r\nthe most favorable series that Mr. von Osten ever obtained in our\r\npresence--and there was only one such--50% of the responses 'without\r\nadmonition' were correct, and 90% when all the correct reactions, both\r\nwith and without admonition, were taken into account.\r\n\r\nNot all the places in the row required the same amount of assistance by\r\nmeans of calls. Those positions which needed the most help, were those\r\nwhich it was most difficult to indicate to the horse by the visual sign,\r\ni. e., the attitude of the questioner's body. We noted above (page 81)\r\nthat the cloths at either end of the row were less difficult to point\r\nout than those nearer the middle. If our hypothesis holds true, we would\r\nexpect that the end cloths would involve fewer auditory signals in the\r\nprocess of pointing out, and those within the row a greater number of\r\nsuch signs. By way of illustration, I will cite one series of tests in\r\nwhich Mr. von Osten was questioner, chosen not because it is most\r\nconformable to my hypothesis but because it is the longest (48\r\nconsecutive tests with five cloths) which I have. In the upper row I am\r\nplacing the successful responses without auditory signs, in the lower\r\nthose involving both auditory and visual signs.\r\n\r\n      Place of the cloth                       : I  II  III  IV  V\r\n  No. of sucessful } visual signs only         : 5   2   1    2  4\r\n     responses.    } visual and auditory signs : 5   5   8    5  5\r\n\r\nWe see that without verbal admonition the first and last places are most\r\nfavorable for success, the second and fourth far less, and the middle\r\nleast favorable. These differences disappear when admonitions are\r\nintroduced, for all of the places then have the same number of correct\r\nresponses with the exception of the middle, which now has even more than\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nOne more experiment which I made will close the discussion. The\r\nfollowing colors were placed from right to left: orange, blue, red,\r\nyellow, black, green. I turned my back upon them, and therefore could\r\nguide the horse by verbal commands only. I asked him to bring the\r\norange. Hans approached the yellow. I now called three times, allowing a\r\nshort interval between the calls. At the first \"Go!\" he passed from the\r\nyellow to the red, at the second from the red to the blue, and at the\r\nthird from the blue to the orange, which he then proceeded to pick up\r\nand bring to me. I had noted this same thing in Mr. von Osten's tests,\r\nalthough there, there were often other factors entering in. By\r\nexercising the utmost precision in facing the cloths, and by using, in\r\naddition, suitable oral signs, I succeeded in getting Hans to bring,\r\nsuccessively, each one of the six cloths in the row, and without a\r\nsingle error,--and all this in the presence of Mr. Schillings who did\r\nnot have the slightest notion of the secret of my success.\r\n\r\nWe need hardly say, in passing, that all that was true of the tests with\r\ncolored cloths, was also true of the tests in which the placards were\r\nused. It was all the same to the horse whichever was placed before him.\r\n\r\nWe have thus tested all of the horse's supposed achievements. None of\r\nthem stood the critical test. It would have been gratifying to have\r\nrepeated some of the experiments and to have made Hans the object of\r\nfurther psychological investigations, but unfortunately he was no longer\r\nat my disposal after the publication of the report of the\r\nDecember-Commission. Some may say that we have had almost enough of a\r\ngood thing, but we must bear in mind that many of the tests which were\r\ncarried out,--such as those in which the method was that of \"procedure\r\nwithout knowledge\", those in which the ear-muffs were used, those in\r\nwhich distractions were introduced,--had previously been made by other\r\npersons (see pages 41f, 45, 63), and with other results, than ours. A\r\nmore thorough test, therefore, would have been doubly desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR'S INTROSPECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter we asked: What is it that determines the\r\nhorse's movements? Independent thinking, or external signs?--We found\r\nthat it was solely external signs, which we described as certain\r\npostures and movements of the questioner. Beyond a doubt these necessary\r\nsigns were given involuntarily by all the persons involved and without\r\nany knowledge on their part that they were giving any such signs. This\r\nis to be seen from their statements, which cannot be cavilled at, as\r\nwell as from the fact that several of them even to-day still doubt the\r\ncorrectness of the explanation which we are here offering. I myself for\r\nsome time made these involuntary movements quite unwittingly and even\r\nafter I had discovered the nature of these movements and had thus become\r\nenabled to call forth at will all the various responses on the part of\r\nthe horse, I still succeeded in giving the signs in the earlier naive\r\ninvoluntary manner. It is not easy, to be sure, to eliminate at once the\r\ninfluence of knowledge and to focus attention with the greatest amount\r\nof concentration on the number desired, rather than upon the movement\r\nwhich leads to a successful reaction on the part of the horse. To some\r\nthis may appear impossible, but those who are accustomed to do work in\r\npsychological experimentation, will not deny the possibility of such\r\nexclusive concentration upon certain ideas.\r\n\r\nIf we now ask: \"What occurred in the mind of the questioners, while they\r\nwere giving the signs?\", the answer can be found only by way of the\r\nprocess which in psychology is technically called \"introspection\", i. e.\r\nobservation of self. In the following we will give the most important\r\nresults of this process of self-observation, which took place in the\r\nsame period in which the observations recorded in the preceding chapter\r\nwere made.\r\n\r\nMy first experiments were made while the horse was counting or solving\r\narithmetical problems and were as follows: Mr. Schillings, who was alone\r\nwith me in the horse's barn, asked me to think of several numbers,\r\nmaintaining that the horse would be able to indicate them correctly upon\r\nbeing asked. He stood to the right of the horse, I stood erect and at\r\nthe side of Mr. Schillings. There was no one else present. Somewhat\r\nskeptical in attitude, I concentrated my mind consecutively on five\r\nsmall numbers. Hans tapped one of them incorrectly, one correctly and\r\nthree by one unit too many. At the time I considered these attempts as\r\nunsuccessful and credited some curious chance with the answers which\r\nwere correct, or nearly so. This was a mistake, for often during the\r\nfollowing days, and in the absence of Mr. von Osten, the horse would\r\ngive correct answers. Others, of course, would be incorrect, and usually\r\nthe mistakes would be by one unit,--so that I soon saw that even in the\r\nhorse's errors there lay some system. It will be seen that Hans\r\nresponded to me from the very beginning, undoubtedly because I had had\r\nthe opportunity of watching Mr. von Osten and Mr. Schillings and had\r\nthus patterned my behavior after theirs. I was not at first successful\r\nin getting the horse to respond correctly in the case of large numbers.\r\nFor in order to get complete control over the horse, and, what was, as\r\nI later discovered, more to the point, control of myself, some practice\r\nwas needed. But I was able to work with the horse quite successfully,\r\nwhile I was still in the dark as to my own behavior.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning Hans responded as promptly to those questions\r\nwhich I articulated merely inwardly, as to those which were spoken\r\naloud. That all formulation of the question was unnecessary, however,\r\nwas shown by the following experiments. If, for example, I did not think\r\nof any particular number until after the horse had begun to tap, and\r\nthen fixed upon 5, he would tap 5. If, however, I told him to count to\r\n6, but gave no further thought to the command after he had begun\r\ntapping, I would get an entirely wrong response. It was easy to obtain\r\nany answer one wished to a question, simply by focussing consciousness,\r\nwith a great degree of intensity, upon the answer desired. Thus Hans\r\nanswered my question: \"How many angles has a hexagon?\", first by 6, then\r\n2, then 27, in accordance with the numbers that came into my mind. The\r\nanimal always followed the ideas which were in the questioner's mind,\r\nand never his words, for it was with the former that the movements upon\r\nwhich the horse depended were bound up.\r\n\r\nIt was not enough, however, simply to imagine the number desired. It was\r\nfurthermore necessary that the questioner be conscious of the moment\r\nwhen the horse reached that number. Larger numbers (above 6) were\r\ntherefore, successful only when every single tap was inwardly counted to\r\nthe end. The manner of counting was indifferent. Thus I counted 6 as\r\nfollows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and later: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and then again:\r\n6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6. Finally I used the Greek letters and also nonsense\r\nsyllables. And in all cases I obtained six taps, the correct response.\r\nIf, however, I simply counted the taps without knowing when the desired\r\nnumber was reached, the responses were always incorrect, e. g., I\r\ncounted\r\n\r\n  For No. 10:  10, 10, 10    continuously,  Hans tapped 13,\r\n   \"  \"   10:   1,  2,  3 to 10              \"      \"   10,\r\n   \"  \"   12:  12, 12, 12    continuously,   \"      \"   15,\r\n   \"  \"   12:   1,  2,  3 to 12              \"      \"   12.\r\n\r\nIn the case of smaller numbers, on the other hand, one often obtained\r\ncorrect results without counting. In this I am borne out by Mr.\r\nSchillings. It was merely necessary to image vividly the number 3, or 4,\r\nor even the name of a week-day or of a month without the number which\r\nwould indicate it. In the last of these cases the number corresponding\r\nto the day or the month (e. g. 3 for Tuesday, 5 for May, etc.), though\r\nnot consciously presented, still evidently lay at hand in the\r\nsubconscious. To use a popular expression, I usually had a \"feeling\"\r\nwhen Hans had arrived at the right number.\r\n\r\nIt was furthermore found that it was not only necessary to count to, or\r\nto think of, the number desired, but that this must take place with a\r\nhigh degree of tension of expectancy--that is, a strong affective\r\nelement must enter in. The state required for a successful response was\r\nnot the mere passive expectation that the horse would tap the number\r\ndemanded of him nor the wish that he might tap it, but rather the\r\ndetermination that he should do it. An inward \"Thou shalt\", as it were,\r\nwas spoken to the horse. This affective state was registered in\r\nconsciousness in terms of sensation of tension in the musculature of the\r\nhead and neck, by intraorganic sensations, and finally by a steadily\r\nrising feeling of unpleasantness. When the final number was reached, the\r\ntension would suddenly be released, and a curious feeling of relaxation\r\nwould ensue. I have made a series of tests to determine the most\r\nfavorable degree of tension in expectation. It was possible to\r\ndistinguish with certainty, three degrees of tension besides the state\r\nof utter relaxation,--all of which I measured by means of the\r\ndifferences in the sensations of tension. In cases of tension of the\r\nfirst degree (greatest concentration) the responses were usually\r\ncorrect, a few, however, were lacking by one unit. There was therefore\r\nin the latter instance a premature release of inner tension. In cases of\r\ntension of the second degree all answers were correct except a very few\r\nwhich were too great by one unit. In cases of tension of the third\r\ndegree, many answers were wrong, and usually by several units too many.\r\nI wished to have the horse tap 10, with the lowest degree of\r\nconcentration. He tapped 13, then in a repetition of the test, 12. I\r\nthereupon increased the tension, Hans then tapped 8. I decreased the\r\ntension once more, but so that it was somewhat greater than at first.\r\nHans tapped 10 correctly. At another time I tried to have him tap the\r\nnumber 5, with a low degree of tension. He tapped 6. I intensified\r\nexpectation and Hans tapped 4. I again decreased it, and he tapped 5,\r\n_comme il faut_. Apparently, therefore, the most favorable degree of\r\ntension was one between the first and second,--the latter being the\r\nleast favorable. After some practice a lesser degree than was used in\r\nthe beginning sufficed to evoke adequate reactions. The flow of nervous\r\nenergy to the motor centers of the brain evidently became facilitated\r\nthrough practice. It will be easy to understand why the first days of\r\nexperimentation caused intense headaches, which later never occurred.\r\n\r\nWhenever, in the foregoing, we spoke of a certain degree of\r\nconcentration which had to be attained, it is not to be understood that\r\nthe same tension had to be maintained throughout the test, from the\r\nhorse's first tap to his last. But rather, that it began with a low\r\ndegree, and gradually increased as the final unit of the count was being\r\napproached. It may best be represented by a curve whose maximum\r\nrepresents that degree of tension which we have been discussing. The\r\nrise to this maximum which, when attained, was followed by a sudden\r\nfall, did not always occur in the same manner. Three types of curve may\r\nbe distinguished, which were first discovered in purely empirical\r\nfashion, and later reproduced voluntarily for purposes of\r\nexperimentation by diagramming before each test the intricate curve of\r\nthe varying degrees which the intensity of concentration was to assume.\r\nThe types may be described as follows:\r\n\r\nI. Here the tension curve rises steadily from beginning to end. This\r\ntype preponderates in the case of small numbers. Thus, when I asked the\r\nhorse: \"How much is 2 plus 4?\", the tension increased slowly with every\r\ntap from the moment I began counting, until the final tap was reached,\r\nwhen it was again relaxed. Externally this relaxation is noticeable as a\r\nslight jerk.\r\n\r\nII. In this case the curve does not rise at an equal rate, but rather\r\nmore slowly at the beginning and later undergoes a sudden increase, or\r\nthe tension increases immediately at the beginning, remains constant for\r\nsome time and then ascends to the maximum. This curve is the rule in the\r\ncase of large numbers and evidently means economy of physical energy,\r\nfor experience soon taught that a steady increase in tension from the\r\nvery beginning soon brought it to a level which cannot be long\r\nmaintained and usually leads to a premature relaxation. In the case of\r\nvery large numbers the alternation of the slight and the sudden increase\r\nmay be repeated several times, and at times it may even sink below a\r\nlevel which has already been attained, thus making a wave-like curve.\r\n\r\nIII. The third type of curve shows a sudden jump between two units at a\r\ncertain point in its course. This may occur in the case of both small\r\nand large numbers but only when the highest or first degree of\r\nconcentration is employed (see page 91). Such a jump frequently occurs\r\nin the transition from the tap preceding the last to the last one which\r\nis being eagerly expected. Relaxation--with the upward jerk and raising\r\nof the head--here occurs at the normal time; Hans taps to the end with\r\nhis right foot. Oftener still the \"jump\" described occurs while passing\r\nover to the number just before the last. The goal seems within reach and\r\nthe mental tension relaxes, and with it the physical tension,--the head\r\ngives a slight jerk and Hans makes the back-step. Since, however,\r\nanother tap is still awaited with some degree of tenseness and, since\r\ncomplete erection of the head does not follow immediately upon the jerk\r\nof the head, the horse gives another tap with the left foot. Thereupon\r\noccurs the complete relaxation of attention, and the assumption of the\r\nerect posture on the part of the questioner. That this is\r\npsychologically the clue which leads to the final tap, will readily\r\nappear from the following remarkable fact: I was able to bring about at\r\nwill either the back-step with the right foot, or the additional extra\r\ntap with the left foot by concentrating the mind either upon the last\r\nunit or upon the one just preceding it. In either case the movement\r\nwhich served as stimulus to the horse followed naturally upon\r\nconcentration on the number. I could of course also control the response\r\nby direct voluntary control of the movements involved. Hans thus solved\r\nfor me the same ten problems first with the back-step, then with the\r\nextra final tap.\r\n\r\nFinally we will indicate the one true inner cause of the difficulty in\r\ngetting the number 1 as a response. It is not easy to relax attention\r\nimmediately after having just begun to concentrate. Relaxation,\r\ntherefore, often occurs with a certain retardation, and the result is a\r\nbelated jerk of the head.\r\n\r\nBriefly, I would also mention a few of the more interesting\r\nintrospective observations which were made in situations in which the\r\nhorse responded with movements of the head for answers such as \"yes\" and\r\n\"no\", \"up\" and \"down\", etc. From the very beginning I put questions to\r\nHans which would have to be answered by a shake of the head. It often\r\nhappened that instead of indicating \"0\", Hans would begin tapping some\r\nnumber. But the wonder of it was that, in many cases, he responded\r\nproperly. I knew only that I inwardly pronounced the word \"null\" (zero),\r\nand that I looked expectantly at the horse's head. In the case of\r\nquestions to which I expected the answer \"yes\" or \"no\", I imagined\r\nmyself enunciating the answer, i. e., I used motor imagery. The tests\r\nfailed, the moment I employed only visual or auditory imagery, whereas,\r\nmotor imagery was always effective in calling forth correct\r\nreactions.[M] When the proper response was \"up\" and \"down\" I would\r\nthink of those directions in space, and likewise with \"left\" and \"right\"\r\nin which case also I would put myself in the horse's place.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote M: Thus it is possible to think of the word \"no\" in three\r\n    different ways. I may get a visual image of the written or printed\r\n    word, or the auditory image of the word as spoken by another person,\r\n    or finally I might think of it in terms of images of the sensations\r\n    of movement which would arise if I myself were to enunciate or write\r\n    the word. And so, in like manner, I could think of any other word in\r\n    terms of either visual or auditory or motor imagery. In all\r\n    probability the auditory and motor always occur together,[6] but\r\n    still it is possible to make the one or the other predominate.\r\n\r\n    It appears that the imagery of most persons is a mixture of\r\n    auditory-motor and visual elements, with a predominance of one or\r\n    the other kind. Individuals who utilize almost exclusively the\r\n    visual (as does the author, as a rule), are rare. But rarer still is\r\n    the pronounced motor type.]\r\n\r\nWhile I was still ignorant of the nature of the necessary movements, the\r\ntests were successful only when I had put the question aloud or in a\r\nwhisper, but never when I failed to enunciate, i. e., when I merely had\r\nthe question in mind (\"in idea\"). But this also became possible after a\r\nlittle practice, although I could not then give an explanation for my\r\nsuccess. Except in one instance, we could discern no difference between\r\nproblems spoken and those merely conceived by Mr. von Osten who had had\r\nthe advantage of long practice. But the one exception deserves mention.\r\nThe old gentleman commissioned Hans, presumably without uttering a word,\r\nto step backward to the left. Hans thereupon responded by giving his\r\nentire repertoire, as follows: He moved his head to the right, then to\r\nthe left. Then he leaped forward and repeated the same movement of the\r\nhead. Hereupon he stepped backward and signified a \"yes\" by a movement\r\nof the head. He then lowered his head and made two leaps forward. After\r\nthis performance Mr. von Osten repeated the same command aloud, and in\r\nevery case Hans responded properly. Again the silent command was given\r\nand again the horse responded with the series of reactions described\r\nabove, lowering his head leaping forward, etc. In this experiment,\r\nwithout exception, the spoken command evoked adequate reactions,--the\r\nsilent command, an incorrect response. Evidently the impulse to movement\r\nwas not so great with the mere conceiving of \"right\", \"left\", etc., as\r\nwhen the words were enunciated. It, therefore, required some practice on\r\nmy part before a sufficiently strong movement-impulse became associated\r\nwith the idea. All this is in no wise at variance with the fact that\r\ntests involving counting and computation were as successful when the\r\nproblem was given in silence, as when it was spoken. The signs for\r\ntapping, viz.: inclination and erection of the head and body, followed\r\nthe question. The question therefore became superfluous. On the other\r\nhand the signs for head-movements on the part of the horse, were given\r\nwhile the question was being put. I ask, which way is \"upward\", and at\r\nthe same time I look upward. In this case therefore the question itself\r\nis not entirely insignificant.--I experienced greater difficulty in\r\ngetting Hans to respond with the head-movement to the left. After much\r\npractice I was able to evoke this movement by means of giving the\r\ncommand aloud, but never by means of the \"silent\" command. Accidentally\r\nI hit upon a device by means of which I attained this end also. I asked\r\nthe horse aloud \"Which direction is left?\",--whereupon he reacted\r\nproperly; then I immediately repeated the question silently, and was\r\nsuccessful every time. My mental attitude here was still the same as\r\nwhen I put the question aloud. What sort of an attitude this was, I\r\ncould not, of course, have stated explicitly at the time. I could not,\r\ntherefore, awaken it at will,--and if I allowed but a minute to elapse\r\nbetween the spoken and the silent question, the vivid after-effect (the\r\nso-called \"primary memory image\") soon disappeared and the test was\r\nwholly unsuccessful. Practice, however, soon helped me to overcome this\r\nlast difficulty also. I believe that my inability to evoke this specific\r\nreaction on the part of the horse, lay in the unfavorable position which\r\nI assumed, for it did not allow the horse to perceive my movements\r\neasily. For the same reason, Hans would at first indicate \"no\" and\r\n\"zero\" by turning to the right, seldom to the left.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of counting, a high degree of concentration was also\r\nnecessary here, but with this difference, that here attention was\r\ndirected to ideas present to the mind, (\"yes\", \"no\", etc.), whereas in\r\nthe counting process attention was directed toward expected sensory\r\nimpressions (i. e., the taps of the horse).\r\n\r\nAll that has been said thus far is readily understood psychologically.\r\nThe following curious fact, however, is noteworthy. Hans used the\r\nhead-movement to indicate two such different concepts as \"zero\" and\r\n\"no\"; it appeared therefore that in both cases he was receiving the same\r\nkind of directive. Observation proved that such was the case and the\r\ndirective in question was none other than an imitation in miniature, or\r\nrather a movement anticipatory of the expected head-movement of the\r\nhorse. Now, whereas the signs for \"up\", \"down\", \"right\", and \"left\" were\r\nnatural expressive movements which are normally associated with the\r\ncorresponding concepts, this cannot be said to be true of \"no\" and\r\n\"zero\". My laboratory observations (see page 107) lead me to conclude\r\nthat the movements, by means of which the concepts \"no\" and \"zero\" are\r\nnaturally expressed, are quite different; and neither of these\r\ncorresponds to the signs for \"zero\" and \"no\" which the questioner\r\ninvoluntarily gave to Hans. What was the genesis of these unnatural\r\nforms of expression? If we might assume that the questioner always had\r\nin mind the movement he awaited on the part of the horse, and never\r\nthought of \"zero\" or \"no\", then the contradiction would solve itself.\r\nBut I must deny decidedly that I ever thought of the movements of the\r\nhorse's head, and Mr. Schillings, whom I questioned on this point,\r\nagreed with me in this, in so far as his own mental processes were\r\nconcerned. I can see nothing for it but that in this instance the\r\nexpressive movements normally connected with the concepts \"zero\" and\r\n\"no\" have been replaced by other forms, without the questioner becoming\r\naware of it. That such displacements may occur, has been shown by the\r\ntests described on pages 107 to 112. That they did occur in this\r\ninstance may be concluded from the following observation. In responding\r\nto me, as well as to Mr. Schillings, Hans always moved his head first to\r\nthe left, then to the right, never in the opposite order. That this was\r\n_not_ a peculiarity of the horse, but must be ascribed to the signs\r\nwhich were given him, is shown by the possibility of inverting the order\r\nunder experimental control (page 77). Frequently Mr. Schillings and I\r\nhad seen the horse respond to his master by means of such\r\nhead-movements, and the order was always, without exception, the one\r\nmentioned. It must be assumed therefore that the horse's movement, which\r\nwe so often noticed, made such an impression upon us, that afterwards it\r\nwas regularly reproduced on our part quite unconsciously, so that Mr.\r\nSchillings never, and I only after a long time, became aware of the\r\nwhole process.\r\n\r\nIn closing, just a word as to the discovery of our own movements. I soon\r\nnoticed that every pronounced raising of the head or trunk brought about\r\nan interruption in the horse's response. But only by observing the\r\nfinal movement in the case of Mr. von Osten did I discover that I, too,\r\nperformed a slight erection of the head. Observation of others was less\r\ndifficult than the observation of one's own movements. As in the case of\r\nall other signs given to the horse, these movements were so slight that\r\nthey were prone to escape notice even though one's whole attention were\r\nconcentrated upon their detection. I also questioned whether in my\r\nattempts to disturb the horse by means of loud calls, it were really the\r\ncall or some simultaneous involuntary movement which was the true cause\r\nof the interruption. The doubt was justified, for when I finally learned\r\nto cry out vehemently without making the slightest move, all my crying\r\nwas in vain. Also it had seemed to me at first as if I were able to\r\ninduce the horse to rear, not only by means of the proper sign or\r\nmovement, but also by a mere command, but I found later that in every\r\ncase there was always some movement, were it ever so slight. Finally I\r\ntried to simulate voluntarily the oft-mentioned involuntary jerks of the\r\nhead. Although it is not very difficult to execute them at will with\r\nalmost the same minuteness as when they were performed involuntarily, I\r\nstill did not succeed in getting a series of such jerks of equal\r\nfineness throughout. In spite of (and partly on account of) the most\r\nconcentrated attention, there would be from time to time a jerk of\r\nsomewhat greater extent and energy. As soon as the movement had been\r\nexecuted, I was able to form a good judgment as to its relative extent,\r\nbut I was unable to regulate the impulse beforehand.\r\n\r\nWith the following comment the chapter will be concluded. Introspections\r\nare necessarily subjective in character. If they are to possess general\r\nvalidity, they must be borne out by evidence furnished by others--and\r\nthis to a greater extent than is necessary for other forms of\r\nobservation. It was hardly possible to get corroboration from the other\r\npersons who had worked with Hans, for, although some of them were\r\nexcellent observers of external natural phenomena, few of them had had\r\nthe necessary amount of practice in introspection. The necessary\r\nconfirmation, however, was had in laboratory tests, which we shall\r\npresently describe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nLABORATORY TESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tests which are to be briefly reported here, were begun in November,\r\n1904, and were carried out at the Psychological Institute of the\r\nUniversity of Berlin. The purpose was twofold: first, to discover\r\nwhether the expressive movements noted in Mr. von Osten, Mr. Schillings,\r\nand others, were to be regarded as typical and to be found in the\r\nmajority of individuals,--and secondly, to ascertain in how far the\r\npsychical processes which I had noted in my own case and which I\r\nbelieved to lie at bottom of these movements, were paralleled in, and\r\nconfirmed by, the introspections of others. The effort was made to make\r\nthe experimental conditions as nearly as possible like those under which\r\nthe horse had worked. The affective atmosphere which colored the\r\nsituations in which the horse took part, could not, of course, be\r\ntransferred, but this was in some respects an advantage. One person\r\nundertook the role of questioner, another--myself--that of the horse.\r\nThe experiments fall into three groups, corresponding to the types of\r\nthe horse's reactions: 1, tests in counting and computation; 2, tests in\r\nspace reactions; 3, tests in fetching or designating objects.\r\n\r\nIn the experiments in counting and computation, the questioner, standing\r\nat my right, thought with a high degree of concentration of some number\r\n(usually between 1 and 10, but sometimes also as high as 100), or of\r\nsome simple problem in addition. Then I would begin to tap,--but in\r\nhuman fashion with my right hand, rather than with my foot--and\r\ncontinued until I believed that I had perceived a final signal. I thus\r\ntested, all in all, twenty-five persons, of every age and sex (including\r\nchildren of five and six years), differing also in nationality and\r\noccupation. None of them was aware of the purpose of the experiments. It\r\ncould not escape them, to be sure, that they were being watched. It was\r\nalso evident to them that the things noted were certain tensions and\r\nmovements; but none of my subjects discovered what the particular\r\nphenomena were that I was looking for. Only in a few isolated instances\r\ndid they report that they were conscious of any movements on their part.\r\nWith the exception of two persons, they all made the same involuntary\r\nmovements which were described in chapter II, the most important of\r\nwhich was the sudden slight upward jerk of the head when the final\r\nnumber was reached. It was at once evident that the direction of this\r\njerk depended upon the position which one had asked the subject to\r\nassume at the beginning of the test, the direction changing whenever the\r\nposition was changed. Thus, if the subject stood with head bowed--the\r\nbody either being held erect or likewise bowed,--then release of tension\r\nwould be expressed physically by an upward jerk. (Occasionally the\r\nentire trunk is slightly raised, so that it was possible to observe this\r\nphysical reaction when standing behind the subject). If the subject had\r\nbent his head backward, the \"psychological moment\" was marked by a\r\nforward movement, (although under certain conditions the head was, in\r\nsuch a case, observed to bend still farther backward). If during the\r\ntests the head was bent slightly to the right, then the reaction was\r\nexpressed in a movement toward the left, and _vice versa_, if it had\r\nbeen on the left, it was bent to the right. If the subject had been\r\nbending his head forward and to the right, he then raised it upward and\r\nto the left, etc. In all of these changes of position I noticed an\r\nintermediate posture which, to be sure, it was not always an easy matter\r\nto discover,--viz.: an upright position in which there was discernible\r\nno manner of head-movement or only a slight tremor. If the subject was\r\nlying on his back with his head supported, then there was noticeable a\r\nvery slight movement to one side. In this same way a number of other\r\npositions were tested in order to discover for each the characteristic\r\nmovement expressive of release of tension. It would therefore appear\r\nthat the raising of the questioner's head, which served as the signal\r\nfor stopping for Mr. von Osten's horse, was but one instance of a\r\ngeneral law which may perhaps be stated thus: The release of muscular\r\ntension which occurs with the cessation of psychic tension, tends to\r\nbring about that position of the head (and body) which, at the time,\r\nrepresents the slightest amount of muscular strain.--These movements\r\nseldom were pronounced enough to be compared to motion through a\r\ndistance of one millimeter, in a very few cases only did they attain to\r\nthe magnitude of one or two millimeters: I failed to note them entirely,\r\nhowever, in only two individuals, two scientific men whose mode of\r\nthought was always the most abstract, and one of these was, in spite of\r\nrepeated attempts, unable to elicit any response whatever on the part of\r\nthe horse.\r\n\r\nIn the cases of the more suitable subjects I was able to indicate not\r\nonly the number they had in mind, but also the divisions in which the\r\nnumber was thought, thus 12 as 5 and 5 and 2, or the same number as 2\r\nand 5 and 5, and I was also able to determine the addends in the\r\naddition--i. e., whether the problem had been conceived as 3+2=5 or as\r\n2+3=5. It frequently happened that in the beginning I would sometimes\r\nmistake these subdivisions, which were recognizable by the less\r\npronounced jerks, for the final number. Thus I would often respond with\r\n4 instead of 8, or 3 instead of 9, or with 3 when the problem was 3+2,\r\njust as Hans had so often done. In these tests, too, the difficulty of\r\ngetting the number 1, as well as the larger numbers, came to light. Thus\r\nthree times in succession 17 was indicated as 4, as 9, and as 17. But\r\nafter some practice I was able to give numbers as high as 58 and 96. The\r\nfrequency of the errors of one unit too many and of one unit too few is\r\nalso noticeable in these tests.\r\n\r\nWe also found desirable corroboration, by trustworthy subjects, of the\r\nintrospective observations of the author, which were reported in Chapter\r\nIII, with regard to the significance of concentration and the curve of\r\nattention. It is hardly necessary to mention that no attempts were made\r\nto influence the subjects in their accounts by asking suggestive\r\nquestions. The most valuable feature about these tests was that the mute\r\nhorse had now been replaced, as it were, by an animal capable of speech,\r\nand that it was now possible to follow the same process both from within\r\nand from without. Two illustrations may be welcome. The one who took the\r\npart of the horse gave three taps and made the following entry: \"At 3 I\r\nsaw a slight upward jerk of the head on the part of the questioner\". The\r\nquestioner however had thought of 4, and made the following note,\r\nwithout knowledge of the other's entry: \"I was aware of extreme tension,\r\nso that it was impossible for me to get beyond 3\". Or again, the\r\n'horse', reacting to a movement on the part of the questioner, stopped\r\nat 3, but the latter, having intended to obtain 2, made the following\r\nentry: \"I noted clearly that I ceased thinking of the number too late,\r\nand did not put on the brakes, as it were, until I had arrived at 3\". We\r\nsee that errors here were entirely the fault of the questioner, just as\r\nhad been the case in the tests with Hans. (See page 151f.).\r\n\r\nIn a second group of experiments I asked a subject to fix his mind upon\r\ncertain concepts, such as \"up\", or \"down\", \"right\" or \"left\", \"yes\" or\r\n\"no\", and others, in any order he pleased, but with the greatest\r\npossible degree of concentration. The subject each time had the choice\r\nof four or six concepts, and he was told to think of one of them at the\r\nsignal \"Now!\". How he was to 'think' the concept was left entirely to\r\nhim. He was also told to interpolate the series with a 'blank', that is,\r\nto think of nothing at all. Standing opposite the subject, I tried to\r\nguess at the mental content of the person's mind, on the basis of\r\nexpressive movements. Sometimes I reacted by shaking or nodding the\r\nhead, etc., just as Hans had done, but as a rule I was content to say\r\nthe word which I thought the subject had in mind. With twelve subjects\r\n(a total of 350 tests) I made an average of 73% correct responses, and\r\nin the more favorable cases I attained even 90 to 100% correct\r\nresponses. Very slight involuntary movements of the head and eyes, which\r\nshowed but little individual variation, and always occurred when the\r\nsubject began to fix upon the concept, were the signs which I used as\r\ncues. As in the case of the movements expressive of the release of\r\ntension, which I discussed above, these movements, too, occurred without\r\nthe subject being aware of them, (except in those rare cases in which\r\nthey had once or twice been especially pronounced). Indeed, it was very\r\ndifficult and in some cases almost impossible for those persons whom I\r\nhad initiated into the secret, to inhibit them voluntarily. \"Up\" and\r\n\"down\", \"right\" and \"left\", were expressed by movements of head or eye\r\nin those directions, \"forward\" by a forward movement of the head, \"back\"\r\nby a corresponding movement. \"Yes\" was accompanied by a slight nod of\r\nthe head; \"no\" by two to four rapid turnings of the head to either\r\nside.[N] \"Zero\" was expressed by a movement of the head describing an\r\noval in the air. Indeed, it was even possible to discover whether the\r\nsubject had conceived of a printed or a written zero, for the\r\ncharacteristics of both were revealed in the head-movements. I was able\r\nlater to verify this graphically. With Ch. as subject, I made 70%\r\ncorrect interpretations in a total of 20 tests; with von A. as subject,\r\n72% in a total of 25 tests. And finally I was able to interpret the\r\nsigns without any errors at all. It was not absolutely necessary to look\r\ndirectly at the subject's face. Even though I focussed a point quite to\r\none side, so that the image of the subject's face would fall upon a\r\nperipheral portion of my retina, I still was able to make 89% correct\r\ninterpretations in a total of 20 tests.--This is not astonishing after\r\nall, when we recall that the periphery of the retina possesses a\r\nrelatively high sensitivity for movement impressions, although its\r\nchromatic sensitivity is very low.[O]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote N: It was Charles Darwin[7] who first pointed out that the\r\n    expressive movements (of the coarser sort) to be noted in nearly\r\n    every race and people show a great, though by no means complete,\r\n    similarity. The similarity is most pronounced in the shaking of the\r\n    head to signify negation and nodding to denote affirmation. It will\r\n    be noted that the former is essentially of the nature of a turning\r\n    toward, and the latter a turning away.[8] These same movements have\r\n    been reported in the case of the blind and deaf Laura Bridgman,[9]\r\n    and we have been explicitly assured that they were a spontaneous\r\n    development, and not acquired by imitation. For it is by imitation\r\n    and never before the completion of the first year, that our children\r\n    acquire these movements. On account of his unreliability, we can put\r\n    but little stock in the statement of Garner,[10] a writer on the\r\n    speech of monkeys, that these same gestures have been observed in\r\n    the case of those animals. My experiments show that the same\r\n    movements, greatly diminished in scope, as a rule accompany the mere\r\n    thought of \"yes,\" \"no,\" etc. I cannot, however, regard the assertion\r\n    as an established fact that every thought process whatsoever is\r\n    connected with some form of muscular movement, as has been\r\n    generalized by the French physiologist Fere,[11] and the American\r\n    psychologist Wm. James.[12]]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote O: The productions of mind-readers, so-called, also, are\r\n    based upon the perception of involuntary movements, insofar as they\r\n    are not based upon pre-arranged schemes and trickery. But there we\r\n    have to do principally with tactual perception, since the reader\r\n    touches the hand of the subject and is guided by its tremor. Some of\r\n    the expert mind-readers, however, conduct tests without touching the\r\n    subject. They depend chiefly upon auditory impressions: the sound of\r\n    footsteps,[13] involuntary whisperings[14] and the changes in the\r\n    subject's respiration[15] and the murmuring of the spectators. To a\r\n    less degree visual signs also are involved: posture and facial\r\n    expression of the subject, and movements of eyes and lips.[16] Even\r\n    the heat radiating from the person's body is supposed to have some\r\n    influence.[17] And my own experience has taught me that surprising\r\n    results may be obtained by the utilization of the movements\r\n    described in the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\n    It may be that these truly microscopic movements also play some part\r\n    in bringing about the success of some of the experiments in\r\n    telepathy, so-called, (transference of thought from one person to\r\n    another, ostensibly without any mediation of the senses known to\r\n    us.) In spite of the huge mass of \"experimental evidence\" which has\r\n    been collected, chiefly in England and in America, it appears to me\r\n    that telepathy is nothing but an unproven hypothesis based upon\r\n    experimental errors.]\r\n\r\nIt was assumed, as indicated on page 99, that in the case of Mr.\r\nSchillings and myself the movements naturally expressive of \"zero\" and\r\n\"no\" had been displaced--without our being aware of the fact--by\r\nothers, viz.: those which the horse required as directives for his\r\nreactions. Since this was the case, we tried to discover if a similar\r\ndisplacement could be brought about experimentally. The attempt was\r\nsuccessful and we discovered that under suitable conditions we could\r\ncause the subject--quite without knowledge on his part,--to establish an\r\n\"association\" between any given concept and any given expressive\r\nmovement. The following experimental series will serve to illustrate\r\nthis fact.\r\n\r\nI had one of the subjects (von A.) think of \"left\" and \"right\" in any\r\norder he chose. (The command was purposely given only in a general way:\r\n\"Think of 'right' or 'left'\".). We had agreed that I was to try to guess\r\nthe mental content of the subject's mind, but I was not to utter a word.\r\nInstead, I was to indicate \"right\" in every case by an arm movement\r\ndownward, and \"left\" by a movement upward. To the subject I gave a\r\nfictitious but plausible reason for all this. The behavior of the\r\nsubject took the following course: In the first three tests he moved his\r\neyes to the right when he thought of \"right\", and to the left when he\r\nthought of \"left\". This was the normal expressive movement. In the\r\nfourth test, however, the thought \"left\" was accompanied by an upward\r\nmovement of the eyes. Two further tests again showed eye-movements to\r\nthe right and left. In the seventh test with the idea \"left\" the eyes\r\nmoved first to the left and then immediately upward. In the following\r\nten tests the eyes were turned regularly upward at the thought of\r\n\"left\", and downward at the thought of \"right\", with only one exception\r\nwhich was a normal movement to the left. The normal expressive\r\nmovements, therefore, were displaced by the artificial, after the\r\nseventh test.\r\n\r\nIn the case of another subject (B.) in whom normally the thought of \"up\"\r\nwas accompanied by a slight raising of the head, and \"down\" by a\r\ndownward movement, these natural forms of expression disappeared\r\nentirely as a result of my arm movements to the right to indicate that I\r\ninferred his having in mind the thought of \"up\", and to the left when I\r\ninferred that he was thinking of \"down\". Instead, there appeared not\r\nmerely the desired movements to the right and left, but rather movements\r\nupward to the right and downward to the left. That is, instead of a\r\ncomplete displacement of the old by the new, there occurred a\r\ncombination of the two.\r\n\r\nA third type of result appeared in still another subject (Ch.), who\r\nnormally expressed the concepts \"right\" and \"left\" by eye or head\r\nmovements (never both kinds at the same time) to the right and left.\r\nHere my arm movements up and down caused the eye and head movements to\r\nbe made simultaneously, so that the thought of \"right\" found expression\r\nin an upward movement of the head and an eye movement to the right, and\r\nthe idea of \"left\" in a downward head movement and a movement of the eye\r\nto the left. The subject had no knowledge of this process, and it took\r\nsix tests to bring about the new reaction. From that point onward the\r\nnew movements were so well established that, depending upon them for my\r\ncue, I was able to make 32 correct inferences in a total of 40 tests.\r\nDuring the latter part of this series I blindfolded the subject, so that\r\nI could not see the movements of his eyes, and therefore had to base my\r\ninference entirely upon his head movements.--After removing the bandage,\r\nat the end of the series, I told the subject that I would go through\r\nanother series, in which I intended to indicate his thought of \"right\"\r\nby an arm movement downward (instead of upward as heretofore), and his\r\nthought of \"left\" by a movement upward. (This he regarded as an idle\r\nwhim of mine). It was only after the twelfth test that the former\r\n\"association\" which I myself had caused to be established, was\r\ncompletely displaced by the new. The thought of \"right\" was now\r\naccompanied by an eye movement to the right and instead of a raising\r\nthere was a lowering of the head. A corresponding change occurred in the\r\nhead movement expressive of the thought of \"left\". These responses were\r\noccasionally varied by some in which only the head movement or only the\r\neye movement occurred. But these movements were always to the right, or\r\ndownward and to the right, at the thought of \"right\",--and to the left,\r\nor upward and to the left, at the thought of \"left\". In ten tests I made\r\nten correct inferences. After the new association appeared firmly\r\nestablished, I ceased responding by means of arm movements, and\r\nindicated my 'guesses' by word of mouth. At first the newly acquired\r\nmovements continued to appear promptly in the subjects. But gradually\r\nthey tended to become more uncertain and finally disappeared, as readily\r\nas they had appeared, and the normal conditions were once more\r\nestablished. Nor was there any tendency to reappear on the following day\r\nin another series of tests. (Those just described had been made on one\r\nday in the course of an hour or two). But as soon as I again used the\r\nearlier method of arm movement to indicate my inferences (raising the\r\narm for \"right\", lowering it for \"left\"), the former artificial\r\nassociation was again established, although not until some 14 tests had\r\nbeen made,--during which the normal movements to the right and left were\r\noften inhibited and during which the conditions were, on the whole,\r\nchaotic. The new association, thus re-established, remained constant\r\nduring the ten tests of the remainder of the series, but has very\r\nprobably again disappeared long ere this. In the case of this subject it\r\nappears therefore that the new associations were superimposed upon, but\r\nin no sense displaced, the normal expressive movements. Nor did the two\r\ncoalesce (except in a few exceptional cases), but tended as a rule to\r\noccur independently of one another.\r\n\r\nI would emphasize once more that none of the subjects had any knowledge\r\nof the purpose or meaning of the experiments. Also, I was convinced by\r\nquestioning the subjects afterwards that none of them--and this is the\r\nessential point--had merely conceived of the arm movement which they\r\nwere expecting me to make, instead of concentrating thought upon the\r\nidea of \"right\" or \"left\". On the contrary, all of them considered my\r\nparticular movements mere vagaries and without purpose, and they felt\r\nperfectly certain that they were in no wise influenced by these\r\nmovements. Also, none of the subjects was conscious of any movements on\r\ntheir part, except one, who was at times aware of her eye movements to\r\nthe right, but never of those to the left, (see page 111), nor of the\r\nhead movements which for us constituted the phenomena of prime interest.\r\nWhen I asked my subjects what they believed to be the cue upon which I\r\nbased my inferences, they invariably responded with probable\r\nexplanations which were always wide of the mark, and those to whom I\r\ndisclosed the cue--(after the experiments were completed), were\r\nthoroughly astonished.\r\n\r\nIn the tests just described we had to do only with such ideas or\r\nconcepts as normally were associated with some stereotyped form of\r\nexpressive movement (see page 106). I now chose a group of ideas which\r\nare not normally associated with a particular form of motor expression\r\npeculiarly characteristic of them, and sought to establish artificially\r\nsuch a connection with some arbitrary movement, without consciousness of\r\nthe process on the part of the subject. Thus I asked one subject (Miss\r\nSt.), who had no intimation of the aim of the tests, to think of the\r\nfollowing words in any order she might choose: \"Ibis\" (ibis), \"Irbis\"\r\n(panther), \"Kiebitz\" (plover) and \"Kuerbis\" (pumpkin). I said that I\r\nwould react to her thoughts by means of arm movements forward and\r\nbackward to the right and to the left, respectively. 15 out of 20 tests\r\nwere successful, without the slightest suspicion on the part of the\r\nsubject (whose whole attention was concentrated on the word-content),\r\nthat she was giving me the necessary directives in the form of very\r\nminute movements of the head and eyes to the right and left, etc. She\r\nwas greatly astonished that I should be able to guess words so much\r\nalike,--(she did not know that the element of likeness was productive of\r\nno difficulty). When, during one of the tests, the subject happened to\r\nthink spontaneously of the movement she was expecting me to make, she\r\nbecame confused, and as a result the number of my sucessful reactions\r\nsuddenly fell. I never would have discovered the cause, had not the\r\nsubject enlightened me without my asking.\r\n\r\nI repeated this series with three other persons, who had had some\r\npsychological training. I did not use the same movement for each word in\r\nall three cases, but indicated the word \"Kiebitz\", for instance, by\r\nmeans of an upward movement in one case, by turning the head to the\r\nright in another, etc. In one of the three cases the tests were almost\r\nwholly unsuccessful. The cause for this came to light later, but it\r\nwould involve too much exposition to discuss it at this point. In the\r\ncase of the other two persons, the tests were successful beyond\r\nexpectation. I had made my various arm movements only a few times when\r\nthey presently began to raise their heads slightly when thinking of\r\n\"Irbis\", and to move it to the right at the thought of \"Kuerbis\", etc. In\r\nthe two series of 35 tests I did not have a single error. In a number of\r\ninstances I succeeded in guessing the word upon which the subject had\r\ndecided, even before the test proper was entered upon--i. e., before the\r\nsignal for concentration had been given. Nothing surprised a subject\r\nmore than the remark: \"You are intending to think of the word 'Kuerbis'\",\r\nor \"You had thought of concentrating your mind upon 'Ibis' but later\r\ndecided in favor of 'Kiebitz'\", yet nothing could be more simple. Before\r\nevery test the subject would consider what word he would fix upon, and\r\nwhile he was saying to himself \"I will choose 'Ibis'\", the proper\r\nmovement would accompany his decision, although it was only very slight,\r\nbecause attention had not yet attained the degree of concentration which\r\nwas employed in the test proper.\r\n\r\nIn these experiments also, the subjects, whom I know to be absolutely\r\ntrustworthy, declared that they never thought of the arm movements which\r\nI was to make. They regarded them as being quite irrelevant. Also--with\r\nbut one exception--they thought of the objects, in so far as they imaged\r\nthem visually, as being directly before them, and not off in the\r\ndirection indicated by my arm movements. Thus they did not image the\r\nplover (\"Kiebitz\") as being on the wing, when I raised my arm, or as\r\nresting on the ground, when I pointed downward, etc. One of the subjects\r\nhad done this occasionally, but by no means regularly. He was therefore\r\nasked to localize all objects in the same place, i. e., directly in\r\nfront of him at the level of the eye. He complied with this request, but\r\nno change, whatever, was observed to occur in his expressive movements.\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome the difficulty just mentioned, I selected another\r\nsubject (Miss von L.), whose power of visualizing was very slight, and\r\nrequested her to fix her mind upon four words which I had selected\r\nbecause they were not, necessarily, associated with a particular image.\r\nThe order in which the words were to be thought of, was entirely\r\noptional on her part. The words were \"Form\", \"Inhalt\", \"Mass\", and\r\n\"Zahl\", (form, content, measure, and number), and each of them I\r\naccompanied, with a certain definite arm movement. The subject always\r\npronounced the word inwardly as emphatically as possible, but without\r\never imaging the corresponding arm movement. Often, it must be noted,\r\nshe did not know whether or not the movement which I made was the proper\r\none. And yet she, too, soon fell into line in the matter of executing\r\nunconsciously the characteristic head movements. In a total of 50 tests,\r\nI was able to make 10 correct guesses in the course of the first 20\r\ntests, 8 in the next 10 tests, and 19 in the last 20 tests. Miss von L.\r\nnoted only a few of her upward head-movements, viz.: those that were\r\nespecially pronounced (movements through about 2 millimeters), but of\r\nthe others she knew nothing. The same experiment was repeated with a\r\npsychologist, well-trained in introspection, as a subject. Success was\r\neven greater here. But no matter how closely the subject observed\r\nhimself, he was unable to solve the puzzle.\r\n\r\nVariations which were introduced in these tests, I will only mention in\r\npassing. Thus, instead of making an arm movement, I, in some cases,\r\nwould tap with my foot, for \"Ibis\" once, for \"Kiebitz\" twice. The\r\nsubject could not see my feet. The involuntary movement-expression which\r\nbecame associated with \"Ibis\" was one nod of the head, with \"Kiebitz\"\r\ntwo nods, etc. Here our only concern was to show that unconscious change\r\nin natural expressive movements and the acquisition of artificial ones\r\nare possible in the case of psychically normal subjects trained in\r\nintrospection.\r\n\r\nI was not satisfied with convincing myself subjectively of the facts\r\nindicated, but sought to fix them objectively, by means of a graphic\r\nmethod. For this purpose I used the device mentioned by Prof. R. Sommer\r\nfor the analysis of expressive movements.[18] The purpose for which\r\nProf. Sommer's apparatus had been constructed, was to record the\r\ninvoluntary tremor and movement of the hand. These movements, of course,\r\ntake place in the three dimensions of space. By means of three levers it\r\nis possible to record the movements upon the flat surface of a smoked\r\npaper fastened to the revolving drum of the kymograph, the movements in\r\neach direction being recorded by a separate lever, in such a way that\r\nthe three curves thus made represent the analysis of a single movement\r\ninto its three dimensional components. By making slight changes, which\r\ntended to complicate the experiment somewhat, I adapted the apparatus to\r\nthe measurement of movements of the head. The method of experimentation\r\nwas the following. The subject whose movements were to be registered,\r\nwas placed in the device in such a way that his trunk and head were bent\r\nslightly forward, the latter a little more than the former. This, it\r\nwill be remembered, was the usual position of the questioner when\r\nworking with the horse. Three levers were attached to his head in such a\r\nway that every movement backward or forward would act upon the first\r\nlever, every movement to the right or left would move the second, and\r\nevery movement of the head upward or downward would be recorded by the\r\nthird. With regard to the sensitivity of the machine, micrometric\r\ndetermination showed that when the subject was properly installed,\r\nmovements through so small a distance as 1/10 millimeter could be\r\naccurately ascertained. The subject was carefully instructed to remain\r\nas quiet as possible, but without constraint. Voluntary movements were\r\nthus obviated. But the question arose: were not the involuntary\r\nmovements thus suffering a loss?--And it was upon them that we were\r\nexperimenting. The question cannot be put aside summarily, but\r\nexperience taught us that the movements in question, nevertheless, did\r\nappear quite effectually, if one could have the right kind of subjects\r\nat one's command. We need hardly mention that besides the two persons\r\nimmediately concerned--I, myself, attended to the apparatus--there was\r\nno one else present, and that the subject was not allowed to see the\r\ncurves produced on the kymograph. Besides the registration of the\r\nhead-movements, I also undertook to register the respiratory-movements\r\nof the subject. This was done by means of the so-called pneumograph,\r\nattached to which was a lever recording the thoracic expansion and\r\ncontraction. This was for the purpose of ascertaining the relationship,\r\nwhich might eventually be found to exist, between the release of psychic\r\ntension, on the one hand, and respiration, on the other.\r\n\r\nThe subject was now told to think of some number, which, of course, was\r\nunknown to me. At a given moment I was to tap upon one of a series of\r\nkeys arranged like those of a piano, with the middle finger of my right\r\nhand--corresponding to the right forefoot of the horse. The questioner\r\nobserved my key, I, his head,--just what had happened in the experiments\r\nwith Hans,--and as soon as I perceived the involuntary closing signal I\r\nreacted upon it by releasing, suddenly, another key upon the same\r\nkeyboard, which I had in the meantime been pressing down with my second\r\nfinger, thus marking what with Hans had been called the backstep. Each\r\nkey was connected with a separate electro-magnet, and these in turn with\r\nmarkers, in such a manner that pressure upon the keys closed two\r\nelectric circuits and, releasing the keys, opened them, and both the\r\nclosing and the opening were recorded upon the smoked paper by means of\r\nthe markers. And, finally, in order to ascertain the time relations of\r\nall these processes, a time-marker indicated the time in fifth-seconds\r\nupon the revolving kymograph record. The time-curve was recorded just\r\nbelow the other curves.\r\n\r\nOf the curves[P] thus obtained under the most equable conditions\r\npossible, we publish seven which show the great general uniformity of\r\nthe tests made upon the horse with those made in the laboratory. The\r\nrole of questioner was undertaken at different times by Mr. Schillings\r\nand the students of philosophy, Messrs. von Allesch, Chaym and K. Zoege\r\nvon Manteuffel. To all of them I am greatly indebted for their unselfish\r\nservices in these laborious tests. The experiments with von Allesch and\r\nChaym, who were among the most suitable of my subjects, were conducted\r\nabsolutely without knowledge on their part of the nature of the\r\nphenomena which I was observing. Neither of them knew anything about the\r\nexpressive movements in which they were unconsciously indulging, and\r\nfurthermore, since they kept their heads bowed during the entire course\r\nof these experiments, they did not perceive what it was that I was\r\nobserving. It is interesting to note that Chaym on the occasion of his\r\nonly visit to the horse, immediately received a number of correct\r\nresponses. Without a doubt von Allesch would have met with equal\r\nsuccess. The other two subjects (von M. and Sch.) went through this\r\nseries of tests, possessing some knowledge of the nature of the\r\nmovements involved. Conditions were such that they (and especially Mr.\r\nSchillings) could not be prevented from obtaining some knowledge of the\r\nessentials, at least. However, it would be wrong to suppose that for\r\nthis reason the results were more favorable, owing, mayhap, to voluntary\r\nefforts on the part of the subject. The contrary was true. The two\r\nsubjects who had no knowledge of the character of the reactions upon\r\nwhich my responses depended, retained their normal habits, unchanged,\r\nthroughout the series,--whereas the last-named two, afraid lest their\r\nknowledge vitiate the result, lost more and more of their power of\r\nconcentration and within a short time were in a condition of tense\r\ninhibition, which is all the more conceivable, since they had had no\r\npsychological training whatever.[Q]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote P: For registering the curves a Hering kymograph was used,\r\n    with a loop 2-1/2 metres long. The kymograph rested on felt. With\r\n    the aid of the Marey model a pneumographic record was taken now of\r\n    the thoracic, now of the abdominal, breathing, never both\r\n    simultaneously, since this was extrinsic to my purpose, and it would\r\n    have made the whole experiment too complex. The time was recorded by\r\n    means of the Jacquet chronograph. For purposes of making more exact\r\n    measurements the acoustic current interrupter of Bernstein was used,\r\n    attuned to 100 vibrations per second. But this necessitated such\r\n    rapid revolution of the drum of the kymograph that the curves were\r\n    not compact enough for purposes of demonstration. The levers were\r\n    all fitted with micrometer adjustments. They wrote tangentially and,\r\n    except the one registering the breathing curve, all points lay in\r\n    one vertical line. The error of deflection and that due to the\r\n    rondure of the writing-surface were both very slight on account of\r\n    the comparative length of the levers and the small extent of the\r\n    excursions, and for that reason synchronous points lie practically\r\n    in one perpendicular. Only the breathing curve has been moved\r\n    somewhat to the left, 7.5 millimeters in figures 6 and 7, 2\r\n    millimeters in figure 8, 4.5 millimeters in figure 9. (When the\r\n    breathing was very profound, as occasionally happened, the error of\r\n    deflection would, of course, have to be taken into account.) The\r\n    curves here used as illustrations have been reproduced in the exact\r\n    size of the originals by the zinco-graphic method, though somewhat\r\n    compressed vertically in order to economize space.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote Q: My own expressive movements, on the other hand, are as\r\n    pronounced as ever. I still find the attempt to suppress them as\r\n    difficult now as when I was working with the horse (page 57). I\r\n    could not, of course, procure a curve of these movements of my own.]\r\n\r\nTheir movements, which at first were quite profuse, decreased more and\r\nmore, so that in the case of von Manteuffel the percentage of my\r\nsuccessful responses sank from 73% correct responses in 90 tests to 20%\r\nin a total of 20 tests,--and in the case of Schillings from 75-100% to\r\n23% in a series of 35 tests. The curves obtained with von Manteuffel as\r\nsubject, which I am here publishing (figures 8 and 15), are, however,\r\ntrue to his normal habits. The same is true of the two first curves of\r\nSchillings (figures 10 and 11), whereas the third (figure 12) shows\r\ndistinctly the traces of the state of inhibition into which he fell, and\r\nrepresents the same condition as when Mr. Schillings, while preoccupied,\r\ntried to work with Hans. All the finer details of the phenomena in\r\nquestion, were likewise unknown to these two subjects.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of a clearer understanding of the various curves, figure 5\r\nis inserted to give the general scheme of their arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nAll curves are to be read like script from left to right. The first is\r\nthe breathing curve of the questioner, the second, third and fourth\r\ncurves represent his head movements,--all translated through the\r\nworkings of the levers into up-and-down movements. The objective\r\ndirection of these head movements is indicated by the arrows. It will be\r\nnoted that (because the lever in question was one with two arms, and\r\ntherefore reverses all movements made) each lowering of the head is\r\nindicated by a rise in the fourth curve, and each raising of the head is\r\nrecorded by a sinking in the same curve. The records of the head\r\nmovements forward and backward and to the left and right (curves 2 and\r\n3) are two and one-half times the size of the actual movements; while\r\nthe curve of the movements up and down (curve 4)--which is of especial\r\ninterest to us--is five times its actual size. The fifth and sixth\r\ncurves, which record my own responses, represent the taps of the\r\nhorse,--the fifth indicating the number of taps and the sixth the\r\nback-step, which was Hans's reaction when he noted the head-jerk of the\r\nquestioner. The seventh, the lowest line, indicates the time in\r\nfifth-seconds. Since the rate at which the drum revolved was not uniform\r\nfor all the tests, the fifth-second marks do not appear the same\r\ndistance apart in all the records, but are farther apart the greater the\r\nrapidity with which the drum revolved. For the experiment itself this is\r\nquite immaterial. Figures 6 to 9 correspond in detail with the diagram\r\njust described. Figures 10 to 12 differ only in that the breathing and\r\nback-step curves (the first and sixth in the diagram) are lacking. In\r\nthese there is no response on my part to the head-jerk of the subject,\r\nbut tapping was continued _ad libitum_ (in the case of the illustrations\r\nhere given I tapped to 5). When these latter curves were taken the\r\nordering and the technique of the experiments had not yet been\r\nperfected. When this was finally done, Mr. Schillings, who acted as\r\nsubject in those tests, had to be eliminated from the ranks of\r\nappropriate subjects on account of the increasing inhibitions, which\r\ngradually developed as described on page 120.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of such curves is rather difficult, and those of different\r\nsubjects cannot be directly compared. It is necessary to make a study of\r\nthe normal curve of each subject taken when his affective state could be\r\ndescribed as \"indifferent\". The influences of the purely physiological\r\nprocesses, such as pulse[R] and respiration, must also be determined.\r\nAnd even so, an interpretation of the curve becomes possible only when a\r\nlarge mass of material is at hand, and when the introspections of the\r\nsubject are taken into consideration. The following remarks, therefore,\r\nare not based solely upon the illustrations given, but upon the mass\r\ntotal of my results.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote R: Slight head movements accompanying the pulse-beat were\r\n    until recently regarded as the symptom of certain diseases of the\r\n    vascular system (the so-called symptom of Nusset), but H. Frenkel\r\n    has now shown them to exist also in normal individuals.[19] I myself\r\n    discovered such movements (lateral as well as sagittal) more or less\r\n    pronounced in all the curves obtained from my subjects. The most\r\n    striking case was that of a young physician whose circulatory system\r\n    was perfectly healthy. In most instances I was able to note these\r\n    oscillatory movements directly and to count them without much\r\n    difficulty. For purposes of control the radial pulse was always\r\n    determined at the same time. The observation of the phenomenon\r\n    appears to be especially easy in the case of somewhat full-blooded\r\n    individuals.]\r\n\r\nIn beginning our analysis, let us take first the breathing curve. Our\r\nresults here were quite in accord with the view taken by Zoneff and\r\nMeumann,[20] who believe that in the respiration is to be found a good\r\nindex of the affective tone of the subject's mental state. In the\r\ngreater number of cases it was possible to conclude as to the degree of\r\nconcentration of attention,--and when this was very great, it was even\r\npossible to get a clue as to the number thought of. Since the high\r\ndegree of tension, under which a subject labored during a test, would be\r\naccompanied by strong affective coloring, we cannot regard as normal any\r\nof the curves here reproduced (with the exception of the two high points\r\nin figure 9). Although breathing was always deep and regular before and\r\nafter a test, during the test it was less deep and irregular. Very often\r\nit was suspended altogether (figures 7, 8 and 9). In ordinary life we\r\noften notice that highly concentrated attention is usually accompanied\r\nby non-voluntary inhibition of movements in the musculature which, for\r\nthe moment, is not directly involved; the man lost in thought slackens\r\nhis pace and finally stands still, the intent listener or looker-on\r\nholds his breath.\r\n\r\nOf the three curves registering the movements of the head, we find that\r\nnothing peculiarly characteristic is revealed by the two upper ones,\r\ngiving the movements up and down, and to the right and left,\r\nrespectively. They are the ordinary tremor-like movements and indicate\r\nnothing beyond the fact that the subject is unable to hold his head\r\nabsolutely quiet for even one second. It is the third line that is of\r\ninterest to us, for it is here that the oft-mentioned head-jerk (which\r\nindicates arrival--in the counting--at the number expected) registers\r\nitself. The moment of the head-jerk corresponds, almost without\r\nexception, with the moment of the first deep inhalation,--just as one\r\nwould be led to expect from common experience. But we are not to regard\r\nthe head-jerk as a result of the inhalation, for it also occurs when the\r\nsubject complies with the request that he hold his breath during the\r\ntest. The actual height of the jerks recorded in figures 6 to 12 was\r\n1/4 to 1-1/2 millimeters and the average height obtained from the forty\r\ncurves of these four subjects was 1 millimeter. There is great\r\nindividual variation: the greatest height that was obtained from the\r\nrecords was 2-3/10 millimeters, the lowest 1/10 millimeter. The\r\nvariations within the records of the several individuals are\r\ncomparatively slight and are evidently dependent, in the main, upon the\r\ndegree of concentration of attention. Thus in the case of von Allesch,\r\nwhere in 75 tests the average height of the jerk is 1 millimeter, the\r\nmean variation is 4/10 millimeter. If, in order to obtain some idea of\r\nthe size of Mr. von Osten's movements,[S] we compared the values gained\r\nin the laboratory with those which would probably obtain in his case, we\r\nwould say that his head movements were more minute than almost any of\r\nthose of which we obtained records. At the most they could not have been\r\nmore than 1/5 millimeter (when measured in terms of the distance through\r\nwhich the brim of his broad hat moved, they would appear to be about\r\n1-1/2 times as large. See page 49.) The movements of Mr. Schillings, on\r\nthe other hand, were certainly four or five times as great as those of\r\nMr. von Osten, and occasionally even greater than that. When we turn to\r\nconsider the time-interval elapsing between the subject's final\r\nhead-jerk and my reaction (as recorded in the sixth curve), we find\r\nthat the reaction-time averages 3/10 seconds, a value which agrees very\r\nfavorably with that estimated for the horse (page 56). Thus it appears\r\nthat man and beast have the same reaction-time--though we must bear in\r\nmind that I worked under some difficulty, since I had to care for the\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote S: In a special series of experiments a subject was\r\n    instructed to execute rapid head movements as minute and as evenly\r\n    as possible. These were registered objectively and at the same time\r\n    I made judgments concerning them. The results showed that my\r\n    judgments were most exact in the case of the most minute jerks. The\r\n    thing that made it especially easy to judge the movements of Mr. von\r\n    Osten under normal conditions, (page 220), was their extraordinary\r\n    evenness, such as I have not met with in any other individual.]\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to a discussion of the several figures.\r\n\r\nFigure 6 (von Allesch) gives a typical view of the great, and at the\r\nsame time economic concentration of attention characteristic of the\r\nsubject. Respiration (first curve) is not so profound as usual, yet is\r\nchanged very little. The head-jerk (fourth curve) is of medium height.\r\nIt occurs just at the proper moment,--the subject had thought of 2, and\r\nhad directed his attention economically. This attention was of the kind\r\ndescribed as type I on page 93. The lowering of the head, (recorded in\r\nthe figure by a rise in the curve), immediately following upon the\r\nhead-jerk upward, is irrelevant.\r\n\r\nIn figure 7 (Chaym) we have a record of a different nature. Respiration\r\nwas inhibited throughout the test,--(the small waves are due to the\r\npulsating of the heart); immediately after the test deep breathing takes\r\nplace. Tension steadily increased till 3, the number expected, was\r\nreached. The head, accordingly, gradually sank a little forward. The\r\nhead-jerk ensued during an interval beginning just before the reaching\r\nof the goal and ended immediately after. The movement was predominantly\r\nbackward, its upward direction being only through a distance of 1/4\r\nmillimeter. (This subject was not so strongly motor as the preceding\r\none.) The reaction followed promptly as seen in curve 6. It was the\r\ndecided raising of the head which follows the head-jerk, that prevented\r\nthe usual back-step with the left foot, when the subject was working\r\nwith Hans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nFigure 8 (von Manteuffel) is typical of strong and at the same time\r\neconomical concentration. Respiration, normally deep and very regular,\r\nis for a time completely inhibited. Tension rises steadily and the head\r\ngradually inclines forward. In the interval between the number before\r\nthe final one and the final one the subject makes a sudden bend forward\r\nand immediately upon reaching the final number gives a violent jerk of\r\nthe head, upward. The attention here would be characterized as being of\r\ntype III, described on page 94. (Owing to lack of space it is impossible\r\nto give an example of type II, which is only to be found in the case of\r\nvery large numbers.)\r\n\r\nFigure 9 (von Allesch) is expressive of great, but--according to the\r\nsubject's introspection--not economical concentration. Respiration,\r\nwhich before and after the test was quite regular, during the test\r\nitself shows a pause. (The tiny waves are due to the heart-beat.) The\r\nsubject had thought of 5, and this number is accompanied by a decided\r\nhead-jerk. But we note that even before the final jerk a number of less\r\npronounced jerks occur--the result of poorly regulated psychic tension.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nFigure 10 (Schillings) depicts a very high degree of uneconomical\r\nconcentration. There was sudden concentration at the beginning of the\r\ntest, and a steady increase throughout its course. Accordingly Mr.\r\nSchillings bent forward at the start, and inclined still farther\r\nforward at the second--and just before the third--tap. But at 3 there is\r\na sudden upward jerk. The number thought of had been 4, tension\r\ntherefore had exploded, as it were, too soon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nFigure 11 (again of Schillings) gives indications, on the other hand, of\r\na medium and economic concentration of attention, which is more normal\r\nin character. The number thought of was 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nFigure 12 (Schillings again) is indicative of a low degree of psychic\r\ntension. With the very first tap the head begins to rise and continues\r\nto do so throughout the test. A true final jerk does not occur, we note\r\nrather in all three curves registering the head movements, slight\r\ntime-marking movements, especially in the second curve. In the third\r\ncurve they are at first minute, but increase steadily in size until the\r\nfourth tap, after which they suddenly disappear. The subject had, as a\r\nmatter of fact, thought of the number 4, but it is hardly probable that\r\nHans would have reacted properly upon these stimuli.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nMr. Schillings had thought of the same number in all three tests given\r\nin figures 10, 11 and 12. The probabilities are that if he had been\r\nworking with the horse at the time, in the first case Hans would have\r\nreacted with three taps with the right foot and a final tap with the\r\nleft, as a result of the questioner's bending forward again after the\r\npremature head-jerk at 3. In the second instance the horse would\r\nprobably have given four taps with the right foot, and in the third, the\r\nchances are that he would have continued to tap beyond the 4.\r\n\r\nThese curves give, on the whole, a fair idea of the intensity and of the\r\ncourse of attention of the various subjects.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider a number of records which illustrate the expressive\r\nmovements involved in the process of thinking of such concepts as \"up\",\r\n\"down\", etc. Their arrangement is identical with the scheme given in\r\nfigure 5, with the exception that the tapping curves (the sixth and\r\nseventh) do not appear. The subject was asked to think of any of the\r\nwords \"up\", \"down\", \"right\", \"left\", \"yes\", \"no\", etc. He was to begin\r\nto conceive them vividly when the command \"Now!\" was given. This moment\r\nis recorded in figures 13 to 15 on the fifth curve. What has been said\r\non page 123 with regard to respiration, holds also in these instances:\r\nonly the first rise recorded in figure 14 can be regarded as normal.\r\nThe magnitude of these movements varies between 1/2 and 3 millimeters.\r\nThe records of the subject whose movements were most extensive, show an\r\naverage of 1-7/10 millimeter (based on 50 tests), with a mean variation\r\nof 6/10 millimeter. Lack of space precludes the reproduction of more\r\nthan three records.\r\n\r\nFigure 13 (von Allesch) shows the movement accompanying the thought of\r\n\"up\", a slight raise of the head, recorded in the fourth curve. (The\r\nthought of \"down\" is accompanied by a corresponding downward movement.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nFigures 14 (von Allesch) and 15 (von Manteuffel) illustrate the nod\r\nwhich is associated with the thought of \"yes\" in the case of two\r\nsubjects. It is essentially the same in both: the head is lowered and\r\nthen raised. The first of the two subjects is more decidedly motor, and\r\nhis movements therefore were somewhat the more extensive. In the case of\r\nthe second subject the nod proper is followed by another which is\r\nsomewhat less extensive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\nA number of other experiments were carried out which corresponded with\r\nthe color-selecting tests made upon Hans. (Page 78.) Five sheets of\r\nwhite paper, 1/2 meter long and 1/4 meter wide, were arranged in a\r\nseries upon the floor, 1/4 meter apart. A dot marked the middle of each.\r\nThe experimenter stood at a distance of 7-1/2 meters and directly\r\nopposite the middle sheet. At about 1/2 meter to the right or left of\r\nhim stood the subject who took the part of the \"horse\". The problem of\r\nthe experimenter was to indicate to the \"horse\" a certain one of the\r\nfive sheets, but without the use of word or gesture. I at first\r\nundertook the role of \"horse\", whereas the others consecutively played\r\nthe part of questioner. All of them looked fixedly at the sheet which\r\nthey had in mind. Besides, it usually happened that they would turn at\r\nleast their heads, and often their bodies, more or less in the direction\r\nof the particular sheet--and this without purpose or knowledge on their\r\npart, but purely as a result of concentration upon the sheet they wished\r\nme to point out. One of the experimenters remarked, quite casually,\r\nthat he had noted that I always made a better judgment, the more\r\nintently he thought of the sheet. Others often admitted that, when I had\r\nmade an error, they had not imagined the sheet vividly, or had been\r\ndebating whether or not to decide to think of the neighboring sheet--the\r\none I had designated. This indecision could be noticed by the direction\r\nof the eyes. But the following table shows how uniform, on the whole,\r\nwas the behavior of the various persons when under the guidance of the\r\nsame impulse. The number of tests was 200 in each case. All errors were\r\nof the same character. Neighboring sheets were mistaken for each other,\r\nand the errors were never of more than one position to either side.\r\nTheir number can easily be obtained by subtracting the percentage of\r\ncorrect inferences from the total, 100%.\r\n\r\n  Experimenter:       v. A.   B.   C.   Mrs. v. H.   K.    Miss v. L.\r\n  Correct inferences:  88%   88%  77%      81%      77%      82%\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the number of correct interpretations is quite high\r\nand in none of the cases does it deviate far from the mean average of\r\n82%.\r\n\r\nI based my judgment as to the direction of the subject's eyes, upon an\r\nimaginary line perpendicular to the center of the cornea. (This\r\nperpendicular does not always coincide with the subject's line of\r\nvision, which was the thing I was after, but this cannot be directly\r\nobtained. This, of course, was what made the judgment a rather difficult\r\nmatter.) My judgment as to the direction of the head I based largely on\r\nthe direction of the nose, (to express it more accurately: upon the\r\ndirection of the median plane.) I purposely noted only the position of\r\nthe experimenter and not the movement which led up to it. When I tried\r\nto do the latter, the results were not always satisfactory, because the\r\nhead and eyes of the person would frequently, in the process of\r\nadjustment, move beyond the goal and thus lead me into error. An attempt\r\nwas made to make each judgment as independent as possible of the\r\npreceding one. But usually, after a few tests, an unintentional\r\nassociation became established between certain attitudes and the\r\ndifferent places in the series of papers. Often all that was necessary\r\nwas to observe the experimenter in order to know which of the places he\r\nhad in mind, it was not necessary to look at the papers at all. Every\r\nchange in the position of the person would, of course, make the\r\nassociation thus established, useless.\r\n\r\nLater, the subjects and I changed roles, I took the part of the\r\nexperimenter and they the part of the \"horse\". The number of tests in\r\neach case was 200 as before. Here, too, errors were, with but one\r\nexception, never more than of one place to either side. Whether the\r\nerror was one place to the right or one place to the left appeared to\r\ndepend upon the position of the person making the judgment, i. e., it\r\ndepended on whether he stood at my right or at my left. The following\r\nresults were obtained:\r\n\r\n  Subject (\"horse\"):    v. A.   B.   C.   Mrs. v. H.   K.    Miss v. L.\r\n  Correct inferences:     76%  79%  75%       81%     77%       74%\r\n\r\nA certain agreement can be seen in these results. The average of correct\r\ninferences is somewhat lower than that which was obtained by me (page\r\n135), 77% as over against 82%. This is probably due to the fact that the\r\nsubjects had had so little practice compared with me.\r\n\r\nWith one of these subjects, Mr. Koffka, a student of philosophy, I\r\ncarried these tests somewhat further, varying them partly by increasing\r\nthe number of sheets of paper, partly by decreasing the distance between\r\nthem. The increase in the number of sheets made only a slight difference\r\nin the results. With 200 tests in each case I obtained the following\r\nresults:\r\n\r\n  No. of sheets     :     5    6    7    8    9   10\r\n  Correct inferences:    77%  72%  72%  69%  73%  68%\r\n\r\nWith but few exceptions, the errors were, as a rule, of one place. The\r\nseries with an odd number of sheets (5, 7, 9) gave better results than\r\nthose with an even number (6, 8, 10). In the tests with the odd number\r\nof sheets the experimenter (K.) stood in front of the middle sheet, so\r\nthat it was at the apex of a right angle made by the series of papers\r\nand the median plane of the subject's body; whereas in the case of the\r\neven number of papers the subject stood opposite the space between the\r\ntwo middle sheets, thus making the position of the sheets less\r\nfavorable.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding tests the distance between the centers of the\r\nneighboring sheets was always 50 centimeters, so that the angle through\r\nwhich the median plane of the experimenter's body would have to turn in\r\norder to pass from one sheet to the next, was about 3-3/4 degrees. In\r\nthe following tests these distances were gradually decreased. The\r\nsheets, always five in number, were replaced by ever narrower white\r\nstrips of paper mounted on dark cardboard and illumined by a Nernst\r\nlamp. The following table shows the decrease in correct inferences\r\nrunning parallel with the decrease of the angle through which the\r\nsubject would have to turn in order to be in line with the several\r\npieces of a series successively. The percentage in each case is based\r\nupon at least 100 tests.\r\n\r\n  Angle:                        3-3/4 deg.   3 deg.   2-1/2 deg.   2 deg.   1-1/2 deg.   1 deg.\r\n  Distance between the\r\n    centres of two neighboring\r\n    papers:                     50cm.   39cm.  33cm. 26cm.  20cm.  13cm.\r\n  No. of correct inferences:     77%     73%    71%   68%    66%    61%\r\n\r\nA curious and unexpected change was here noted in the subject, Mr.\r\nKoffka, who, while concentrating his attention to the uttermost, began\r\nunawares to develop a new system of expressive movements of the head.\r\nWhen the distance between the sheets was relatively great, he had been\r\nin the habit of turning his head and eyes in the direction of the sheet\r\nintended, and as the distances became less he had reacted only by a\r\nturning of the eyes. But now, as the distances were still further\r\ndecreased, he began again to react by means of head movements, and these\r\nwere of exaggerated magnitude, for which he would compensate, as it\r\nwere, by an eye-movement in the opposite direction. Although the head\r\nmovements decreased in scope as the distances between the sheets were\r\nsteadily decreased, they still were always decidedly greater than the\r\neye movements, which I was now normally led to expect and which could be\r\njudged without much difficulty. This form of reaction was much more\r\nsatisfactory as a cue, and therefore it came to pass that, whereas in\r\nthe preceding series I had made only 60% correct inferences when the\r\nangle was 1 degree, I now found that--the angle remaining the same--80%\r\nof my inferences were correct. (My final judgment I continued to base,\r\nas before, upon the position, and not upon the movement, of head and\r\neye). The number of correct inferences continued relatively high, even\r\nafter the distance between the papers was decreased tenfold,--as will be\r\nseen from the following table:\r\n\r\n  Angle:                       1 deg.  30'  15'  9'  7'  6'  5'  3'    2'\r\n  Distance between the\r\n    centres of two neighboring\r\n    papers:                   131  65   33  20   15  13  11 6-1/2 4mm.\r\n  Percentage of correct\r\n    inferences:               80   79   78  81   84  80  77  68    68%\r\n\r\nBeginning with an angle of 1' (distance between the centers of two\r\nneighboring papers = 2 mm.), the subject was unable to focus, with\r\nsufficient steadiness of vision, upon one paper alone, and the\r\nmovements, for that reason, ceased to manifest themselves. Comparing the\r\nresults obtained in the case of this subject with those obtained from\r\ntwo others, whose reactions had remained normal, B. and Miss St., we\r\nfind that with them there were only 53% correct inferences in both cases\r\n(based each upon 200 tests), when the angle was 5'. In my errors, too, I\r\noften shot wider of the mark. In another series of 200 tests, in which\r\nMiss St. \"merely thought of the places\", I had a percentage of 56%\r\ncorrect inferences, and my errors did not become any coarser. Miss St.\r\nbelieved this a case of true telepathy, but I had been guided in my\r\njudgments entirely by her unwittingly made movements--or rather the\r\ndirection--of her eyes. The magnitude of these movements bore a constant\r\nrelationship to the distance between papers as it was conceived by the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nReviewing the experiments discussed in this chapter, we find that the\r\nsame kind of movements and postures, which had been noted in persons\r\nexperimenting with the horse, tended to recur in the laboratory, in so\r\nfar as the mental attitude of the subjects, given in their introspective\r\naccounts, corresponded with that of the questioners of the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF THE OBSERVATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author having described the observations made upon the horse, and\r\nhaving discussed the activities of the questioner upon the basis of\r\nobservations made objectively and upon his own introspections, and\r\nhaving verified the results thus obtained, by means of laboratory\r\ntests,--we are now in a position to solve satisfactorily all the\r\nproblems which this interesting case has presented.\r\n\r\nThat which is least difficult to understand is the horse's seeming\r\nknowledge of language and particularly his ability to answer questions,\r\nno matter by whom, or in what dialect, they were put. As a matter of\r\nfact, it made no difference who desired an answer, for the only person\r\nupon whom the experiment depended was the questioner, that is, the one\r\nwho asked the horse to tap. We have everywhere designated this person as\r\nthe experimenter or questioner. It was he who gave the directions, and\r\nsince all that were involved were visual signs, the drama in which Hans\r\nappeared as the hero, was nothing but a pantomime. All speech was\r\nsuperfluous and, except in so far as the tone of voice in which it was\r\nspoken was soothing or reprimanding, it was quite unintelligible to the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing, the reader understands without further explanation\r\nHans's ability to count and to make computations. If the number of taps\r\nhad depended solely upon the length of time and the angle at which the\r\nquestioner bent forward, the horse would have been able to tap any\r\nnumber desired. Since, however, only the right foot was employed, the\r\nleft one being used at most for making a final tap, the number of taps\r\nhad an upper limit which was due to the fatigue of the animal. This\r\nlimit was about 100. That it was possible to ask such questions as: \"How\r\nmany times is 100,000 contained in 654321?\", and thus to give problems\r\ninvolving millions, is perfectly clear.\r\n\r\nAll wonderful feats of counting and computation which were accomplished\r\nwhile thus experimenting with the horse are to be accredited, not to the\r\nhorse, but to the questioner. If such is the case, they certainly cannot\r\nbe considered astonishing. Thus, when to the question, \"How many of the\r\ngentlemen present are wearing straw hats?\" the horse answers correctly\r\nin accordance with the wording of the question and omits the straw hat\r\nof a lady, then Mr. von Osten is the guide. It is no wonder that Hans\r\nnever showed the slightest excitement when confronted with difficult\r\nproblems, nor that it apparently took no time whatever to solve them.\r\n\r\nHans, however, was also a faithful mirror of all the errors of the\r\nquestioner. Aside from mistakes due to occasional interruptions on the\r\npart of visitors, these errors had two sources: faulty computation and\r\ninadequate concentration--i. e., aside from arithmetical errors on the\r\npart of the questioner, were his premature or belated movements. Since\r\nboth of these factors might be operative, the following three\r\npossibilities arise.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The questioner computes correctly but does not move at the proper\r\nmoment. Nearly all the errors which had been accredited to the horse,\r\nwere of this kind.\r\n\r\nA part of these errors had the appearance of being significant, that\r\nis, they might be interpreted as a misapprehension of the question. If,\r\nfor instance, instead of a sum only one of the quantities was given, or,\r\nif instead of a product only one of the factors was given, it might be\r\ninterpreted that the horse simply wished to repeat the problem. Thus,\r\nMr. von Osten in response to the question: \"How much is 3 times 5?\",\r\ntwice in succession received the answer, \"3\", and upon my question, \"How\r\nmuch is 3 plus 4?\" he answered, \"3\", and to \"How much is 2 times 6?\" he\r\ntapped 6, and to \"What is one-fourth of 36?\" 4. In part (certainly in\r\nthe second and third example cited) an individual quantity or factor had\r\nbeen emphasized in the consciousness of the questioner (cf. page 105)\r\nand in part the reactions were due to chance. Thus, when Mr. Hahn asked\r\nthe question: \"What is one-half of 10?\", he received the following\r\nresponses: 2 and 10, and then 17 and 3. To this class belong also, the\r\ntests made by the Commission of September and reported in Supplement\r\nIII. (See page 255).\r\n\r\nOther errors, even though they may not have appeared to be significant,\r\nmight yet have been characterized as mistakes due to speed; as when, e.\r\ng., Hans made an error of one unit--and sometimes, though less\r\nfrequently, of two units--too much or too little in his response. One\r\nmight be led to believe that Hans had not made an error of calculation\r\nbut merely of counting in the process of giving his result, which always\r\nhad to be done by the cumbersome method of tapping. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe trouble lay in the wrong degree of concentration on the part of the\r\nquestioner: In errors of +1, tension was too slight, in those of -1, it\r\nwas too great (see page 91). This comes out clearly in a comparison of\r\nthe two more extensive series which I took in the case of Mr.\r\nSchillings. During the first series, he was well disposed, and was able\r\nto concentrate effectively, while during the second, he was nervous and\r\neasily diverted. This difference in intensity of concentration in the\r\ncase of the two series is attested, not only subjectively by Mr.\r\nSchillings's introspective statement, but may be measured objectively by\r\nmeans of the number of final taps which the horse gave with his left\r\nfoot during these two series. We saw (page 94) that these final taps\r\nwere always a sign of intense concentration and, as a matter of fact,\r\none-half of the horse's responses to Mr. Schillings during the first\r\nseries were made in this way; whereas, in the second series, only\r\none-third were of this sort. (I, myself, was never able to get, without\r\nconscious control, a greater number of this type of response.) We may\r\ntherefore say that, in the first series we had a high degree of tension,\r\nor concentration, whereas, in the second series, we had a low degree.\r\nThe errors distribute themselves over the two series as follows:\r\n\r\n                                    +1    +2    -1    -2\r\n  Series I (31 tests)\r\n           Correct responses: 87%\r\n           Incorrect   \"    :        0%   0%    13%    0%\r\n  Series II (40 tests)\r\n           Correct responses: 40%.\r\n           Incorrect   \"    :       40%   8%    2.5%   0%  (and 9.5%\r\n                                             other kinds of errors.)\r\n\r\nWe find in Series I no \"+1\" errors, but only \"-1\" errors; in series II,\r\non the other hand, the errors are almost exclusively of the \"+1\"\r\ncategory, equaling the number of correct responses, and there is only\r\none \"-1\" error. A series obtained in the case of Mr. von Osten is almost\r\nas satisfactory an illustration. When he first began to take part in\r\ntests in which the procedure was the one we characterized as \"without\r\nknowledge\" and had to note their complete failure, he was thrown into\r\nsuch confusion that the responses in the case of procedure with\r\nknowledge were also incorrect. The errors there were always +1, (whereas\r\nthose in the case of procedure with knowledge, which were due to quite\r\ndifferent causes, were very great and inconstant.) The number of +1\r\nerrors obtained on this occasion comprises one-fourth of all the plus\r\nerrors which were ever obtained in the case of Mr. von Osten during the\r\nentire course of these experiments. Finally, I would mention two\r\nexamples of my own. In the course of my very first attempts with Hans I\r\nobtained, as I said on page 89, three responses in a total of five which\r\nexceeded the correct result by 1. This I would explain by the fact that\r\nalthough I employed a high degree of concentration, I nevertheless was\r\nsomewhat skeptical. The result was a certain deficiency in the degree of\r\nconcentration. A second example which I would cite is taken from the\r\nperiod in which I had already discovered the cue to Hans's reactions and\r\ngoes to show that I was then still able to eliminate the influence of\r\nthis knowledge and to work ingenuously. To the question, \"How much is 9\r\nless 1?\" I, momentarily indisposed, received the answer 10, and then six\r\ntimes in succession the answer \"9\", and finally the correct response,\r\n\"8\".\r\n\r\nErrors of another kind--the not infrequent offenses against the very\r\nelements of counting and the fundamental arithmetical processes--were\r\nregarded in part as intentional jokes and by an authority in pedagogy as\r\na \"sign of independence and stubbornness which might also be called\r\nhumor\". Hans emphatically asserted that 2+2 was 3 or he would answer\r\nquestions given in immediate succession as follows: \"How many eyes have\r\nyou?\"--2. \"How many ears?\"--2. \"How many tails?\"--2. These errors, as a\r\nmatter of fact, evince neither wit nor humor, but prove incontrovertibly\r\nthat Hans had not even mastered the fundamentals.\r\n\r\nMany of the errors baffle every charitable attempt at interpretation.\r\nThese gave the horse the reputation of capriciousness and unreliability.\r\nIf Hans designated the tone \"e\" as the seventeenth, or \"g\" as the\r\neleventh, or when he called Friday the 35th day of the week or believed\r\n50 pfennige to be worth only 48, the cause for these responses lay\r\neither in the insufficient degree of tension on the part of the\r\nquestioner (as in the first three examples) or in the extravagant\r\nexpenditure of the same (as in the last case). If, therefore, the horse\r\nat times would \"hopelessly flounder\" which would seem to be indicated by\r\ntapping now with the right and now with the left foot, then as a matter\r\nof fact, this form of reaction came about as was described on page 61,\r\nwith this difference that there we had to do with voluntary controlled\r\nmovements on the part of the questioner, whereas here, they are the\r\nresult of an unsuitable degree of tension which expressed itself in\r\nfrequent and disconcerting jerks. Besides the answer 3, this so-called\r\nfloundering was the only reaction the average person could obtain from\r\nthe horse in the absence of Mr. von Osten and Mr. Schillings. It would\r\nhowever occur also in the case of these gentlemen and would be received\r\nby them with resentment when in truth it was Hans's greatest feat, for\r\nhe showed his extremely keen reaction upon every movement of the\r\nquestioner. To this group belong also the errors in the case of higher\r\nnumbers, the sole cause of which lay in the difficulty with which\r\ntension could be maintained and the body kept motionless for so long a\r\nperiod. These errors occurred in accordance with a certain law. If, for\r\ninstance, a certain test repeatedly evoked incorrect responses, the\r\nquestioner would gradually increase the duration of tension and would\r\nthus come a little nearer to the desired goal with every test. In this\r\nway, Mr. von Osten desiring 30 as an answer obtained consecutively the\r\nresponses, 25, 28, 30; and I, myself, for the answer 20, received\r\nconsecutively the responses 10, 18, 20 (see also the laboratory tests,\r\npage 105). Sometimes too, the questioner would flag in his efforts\r\nbefore the goal was reached. Thus in one of my first tests, I received\r\nfor the answer 11 the following responses: 1, 4, 5, 7, 4. I was unable\r\nto get beyond 7. In other instances, the horse responded first with too\r\nfew and then with too many taps. The correct response therefore could\r\nonly be obtained after an appreciable amount of gauging of tension, as\r\nin target practice there must be a gauging of distance. (See page 92).\r\nIn this way Mr. von Osten obtained for 10 the responses 8, 8, 11, 10,\r\nand Mr. Schillings for 17, received 9, 16, 19, 18, 18, 14, 9, 9, and\r\nfinally, after some efforts, 17 taps. Thus there was a rise from 9 to\r\n19, then a fall back to 9 and after eight tests the correct response. As\r\nlong as we attempt to explain this fact as error on the part of the\r\nhorse, so long will it remain inexplicable, but the moment we regard it\r\nfrom the point of view of the psychology of the tension of expectation,\r\nit becomes perfectly plain.\r\n\r\nThe same holds true for the curious predilection which Hans appeared to\r\nhave for the numbers from 2 to 4, especially for 3 (see page 68). As a\r\nmatter of fact the cause of this lies in nothing other than the\r\ninadequate concentration of attention on the part of the questioner and\r\nless often in an extravagant expenditure of concentration, which\r\nexplodes immediately after the first tap on the part of Hans (as in the\r\ncase of my first tests); but usually the cause lay in a complete lack of\r\nconcentration, though the same result may be produced by various causes.\r\nIt is usually after 2 to 4 taps of the horse's foot that the questioner,\r\nwho does not concentrate, makes his first move which naturally puts an\r\nend to the tapping on the part of the horse. As a rule this jerk follows\r\nimmediately upon the second tap. (On the other hand, relaxation of\r\nattention is very difficult upon the first tap. See page 95). The\r\nquestioner, however, would expect further tapping and therefore would\r\nnot bring his body back to a completely erect position and the result\r\nwould be a 3, the last unit of which would be given by the final tap\r\nwith the left foot. Here we also obtained light as to the answers which\r\nHans gave in those tests in which the method was that of \"procedure\r\nwithout knowledge\". These responses had nothing to do with the problem,\r\nfor neither the horse nor any one else knew the solution. But in the\r\nhorse's responses the degree of tension of the questioner's\r\nconcentration was faithfully mirrored. An experimenter who was as\r\nskillful in concentrating as Mr. von Osten, obtained--almost without\r\nexception--very high numbers, whereas one whose concentration was slight\r\nwould receive in response to nearly all questions the answers 2, 3 or 4.\r\nThus, the Count zu Castell received in response to seventeen questions\r\nthe answer 2, three times, the answer 3, six times, and the answer 4,\r\nfour times, two answers being accidentally correct.\r\n\r\nAnother group of errors was characterized as stubbornness on the part of\r\nHans, such as his persistence in repeating an incorrect response, or his\r\nrepetition of a former correct answer in response to later questions\r\nwhere it was perfectly senseless. During a demonstration before a large\r\nnumber of persons, I held a slate with the number 13 upon it within the\r\nhorse's view and also within view of the spectators. I, myself, did not\r\nknow what number was written on the slate. Having been asked to tap the\r\nnumber, Hans responded by tapping 5. The grand-stand shouted \"Wrong!\" I\r\nasked Hans to try again. Four times in succession he answered 5. At\r\nanother time Mr. von Osten and I each whispered a number (7 and 1,\r\nrespectively,) into the horse's ear and asked him to add the two. Three\r\ntimes in succession he tapped 11. After the test had been repeated in\r\naccordance with \"procedure with knowledge\" and a correct response had\r\nbeen received, we tried once more a test of \"procedure without\r\nknowledge\". Again, he responded with an 11. On a third occasion, I asked\r\nHans to tap 5. He responded with a 4 and then, correctly, with a 5.\r\nThereupon, I asked him to tap 6. Again, he responded with a 4. Then I\r\nasked him to tap 7. Once more he responded with a 4, and only when I\r\nproceeded to count aloud did he tap 7 correctly. I had him repeat the 7\r\nand then went over to 9. Promptly he responded with another 7. In these\r\ncases, which by-the-way were not very frequent, we have to do, not with\r\nstubbornness on the part of Hans, but with the persistence of that\r\nnumber in the consciousness of the questioner. Modern psychology has\r\nrecognized this tendency of ideas, which have once been in\r\nconsciousness, to reappear on other occasions even though they are\r\nwholly inappropriate. It has been termed \"perseverative tendency.\"\r\n(Perseverationstendenz).[21]\r\n\r\nWhile the errors thus far discussed appeared sporadically in long series\r\nof correct responses, there still might be observed at times a massing\r\nof errors, usually at the beginning of a day of experimentation or at\r\nthe beginning of a new series. We were regularly told that Hans always\r\nhad to have time to adjust himself to new circumstances. The records\r\noften showed comments such as these: \"After a number of practice tests\r\nthe horse appears particularly well disposed\", or \"Hans, at first\r\ninattentive, does not respond. Suddenly he gets the hang of things\".\r\nDifferent questioners who worked with the horse required different\r\nlengths of time to obtain proper responses. Some needed a quarter of an\r\nhour, others scarcely half a minute. I, myself, found that in the degree\r\nin which I learned to control my attention, in that degree did this\r\nphenomenon tend to disappear, but would reappear the moment I became\r\nindisposed. From this we see that, instead of attributing all sorts of\r\nmental characteristics, such as stubbornness, etc., to the horse, we\r\nshould lay them to the account of the questioner. As a matter of fact we\r\nfind that this \"getting into the sweep of things\", i. e. the overcoming\r\nof psycho-physical inertia, has long been known in the case of man and\r\nhas been experimentally determined and called \"Anregung\" (excitation) by\r\nthe psychiatrist, Kraepelin,[22] and his pupil, Amberg.[23] A massing of\r\nerrors toward the end of a long series occurred only when the questioner\r\nwas fatigued. There was nothing which had to be interpreted as fatigue\r\nor as indisposition on the part of the horse, (except in the few cases\r\nof very large numbers, cf. page 67). To be sure, Mr. von Osten always\r\noffered these two excuses. That they were without warrant is shown by\r\nthe fact that Hans, after appearing indisposed or fatigued while working\r\nwith one questioner, would nevertheless react promptly and correctly a\r\nmoment later for some other experimenter, and furthermore, when working\r\nwith me, the number of his correct responses would rise or fall with my\r\nown mental disposition.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would here note a rather interesting observation for which I\r\nam indebted to Mr. Schillings and the Count zu Castell. They had\r\nnoticed, independently of each other, that the horse would often fail to\r\nreact when for any length of time he was given problems dealing with\r\nabstract numbers, even though they were of the simplest kind; but that\r\nhe would immediately improve whenever the questions had to do with\r\nconcrete objects. They believed that Hans found applied mathematics more\r\ninteresting, and that abstract problems, or those which were altogether\r\ntoo elementary, bored him. The Count zu Castell furthermore noticed that\r\nthe responses tended to be more correct as soon as he had the horse\r\ncount objects which he, himself, (Castell) could see during the test.\r\nQuite in accord with this is the statement to be found in the report of\r\nthe September-Commission, in which we find this note in a discussion of\r\nthe arithmetical problems (not involving visible objects), which the\r\ngentlemen already mentioned had given the horse. \"The horse responded\r\nwith less and less attentiveness and appeared to play with the\r\nquestioner.\" Here again, that was looked for in the animal which should\r\nhave been sought in the man. Mr. Schillings was capable of intense, but\r\nnot continued concentration and it was he who was bored, and not the\r\nhorse. And it was the Count zu Castell and not the horse that found it\r\nnecessary to invoke the aid of perceptual objects to bring his\r\nattention to the proper height of concentration.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see that thus far I have supposed the horse to be a\r\nnever-failing mechanism and that I have placed all errors to the account\r\nof the questioner. The horse never failed to note the signal for\r\nstopping and therefore never was the immediate cause of an error. It is\r\nnot to be denied that now and then he would cease tapping spontaneously\r\nand in this way would become the cause of an error. We have no data on\r\nthis point, but undoubtedly the horse's share in the total number of\r\nerrors was very slight.\r\n\r\n(_b._) Another source of error was faulty computation on the part of the\r\nquestioner. The questioner made the signal for stopping when the\r\nexpected number of taps had been reached. The horse faithfully mirrored\r\nthe miscalculation of the questioner. I have knowledge of only one such\r\ncase. The journals report that once Mr. von Osten, when someone called\r\nto his attention that Hans had indicated the wrong day of the week,\r\nreplied: \"Yes, you are right, it was not Thursday, but Friday,\"\r\nwhereupon Hans being asked again, promptly responded correctly. This\r\nappeared to the reporter in question as proof of the subjective\r\ninfluence of Mr. von Osten upon the horse.\r\n\r\n(_c._) When errors in calculation and failures in proper concentration\r\ncombine, i. e. when the questioner makes a mistake in calculation\r\nbecause he is excited or inattentive and for the same reason does not\r\nmake the movement, which is the signal for stopping, in accordance with\r\nthe number which he deems to be the correct answer, then the result is\r\nusually wrong, but it may be correct in the few cases in which the two\r\nerrors exactly compensate each other. Nothing has been so effective in\r\nestablishing Hans's reputation, nothing has brought him so many\r\nfollowers, as these cases in which he, rather than his mentor, has been\r\nin the right. Compared with the mass of cases in which Hans was wrong\r\nthese latter cases are diminishingly few in number, yet these few made\r\nsuch an impression upon the observers that their number tended to be\r\noverestimated. As a matter of fact, I have been able to discover records\r\nof only seven such cases. Two of these were reported by the Count zu\r\nCastell. On the 8th of September, he entered the horse's stall, alone,\r\nand believing it to be the seventh day of the month, he asked Hans the\r\ndate. The horse responded correctly with 8 taps. At another time he held\r\nup before Hans a slate on which were written the numbers 5, 8 and 3 and\r\nasked the horse to indicate their sum which in the momentary excitement,\r\nvaguely appeared to Castell to be 10. To his chagrin he noticed that\r\nHans continued to tap. Thereupon he intentionally remained motionless\r\nuntil the horse had stopped tapping spontaneously--as he thought--at 16.\r\n(The newspapers reported that the numbers to be added had been 5, 3, and\r\n2; that the questioner had expected the answer 11, but that Hans had in\r\nthree tests always ceased tapping at 10.) In both cases the questioner\r\nregarded the answers of the horse as wrong and recognized his mistake\r\nwhen his attention was called to it. I, myself, had the same experience.\r\nOne time I received in response to the question, \"What day of the week\r\nis Monday?\", the answer 2, although I had expected the answer 1; at\r\nanother time I asked, \"How much is 16 less 9?\", and the horse responded\r\nwith 7 taps, although I had erroneously expected 5. I noticed my mistake\r\nonly when my attention was called to it by one of those present. Another\r\nexample is related by Mr. Schillings. A row of colored cloths lay\r\nbefore Hans. Beside them stood an army officer. Pointing to the latter's\r\nred coat Mr. Schillings asked the horse to indicate, by means of\r\ntapping, the place in the row where a piece of the same color lay. Hans\r\ntapped eight times, but Mr. Schillings reprimanded him because the red\r\npiece was, as a matter of fact, second in the row. Upon a repetition of\r\nthe test, Hans again tapped 8. (By some, the facts are recounted as\r\nhaving been the other way round; viz.: Hans tapped 2 instead of 8. This\r\nof course would call for a different explanation.) It was noticed that\r\nat the place which would be indicated by eight taps there was not a red\r\npiece but a carmine colored piece of cloth. A newspaper reports,\r\nsomewhat vaguely, a sixth case as follows: Hans was asked to spell the\r\nname \"Doenhoff\" and began correctly: \"Doe\". Mr. von Osten, who somehow\r\nbegan to think of another name, \"Dohna\", interrupted him and wished to\r\ncorrect him by suggesting o instead of oe (i. e., 2 taps instead of 3).\r\nHans, however, continued to spell the entire word with the greatest\r\nequanimity. He had not erred. A similar experience is reported by Mr. H.\r\nvon Tepper-Laski, the well known hippologist. Although the details have\r\nslipped from his memory, he reports that in the case in question the\r\ncorrect answer was thrice refused by the questioner who thought that the\r\nhorse's answer was incorrect. Hans, upon being severely reprimanded in a\r\nloud and harsh tone of voice, turned about as if disgusted with the\r\ninjustice of the man and made straight for his stall.--It is clear that\r\nin the cases described we are not dealing with accidentally correct\r\nresponses, for in nearly every case the test was repeated a number of\r\ntimes and the same responses were received each time. As a matter of\r\nfact, my own introspection convinced me that the third and fourth cases\r\nwere surely, and the first and sixth were very probably, due to\r\ninsufficient concentration on the part of the questioner. Accordingly\r\nthere is everywhere in these cases a difference of +1 or +2 between the\r\nnumber thought of and the number tapped (see page 92 f.). The data in\r\nthe second and fifth and still more in the seventh case were too meager\r\nto warrant an attempt at explanation, for it is not even known whether\r\nHans responded with more or fewer taps than was expected by the\r\nquestioner. It is unfortunate that a more complete record was not made.\r\n\r\nThe frequent and intentional attempts of Mr. von Osten to induce the\r\nhorse to give an incorrect response,--which, by-the-way, were regularly\r\nunsuccessful--belong only apparently to this group. Thus he asked, e.\r\ng., \"2 times 2 is 5, is it not?\" \"3 times 3 is 8?\", etc., but Hans\r\nrefused to be misled, and responded correctly. This was from the very\r\nbeginning one of the main arguments for independent thinking on the part\r\nof the horse. The actual procedure was as follows, even though the\r\nquestioner had said \"2 times 2 is 5\", there still was present in his\r\nconsciousness the number 4. I, myself, would think either of the first\r\nmember of the equation, i. e., 2 times 2, in which case Hans would\r\nrespond with 4 taps or I would have in mind the second member, i. e., 5,\r\nin which case he would respond with 5 taps. Never did I succeed in\r\nthinking of both at the same time. The association between the thought\r\n\"2 times 2\" and the concept \"4\" is so close and supported by so many\r\nother associations that the attempt to form a new one, that is at\r\ncomplete variance with all these, is futile. One may say \"2 times 2\r\nequals 5\" but it is impossible to conceive it.\r\n\r\nLet us turn now, from the tests in counting and computation to those in\r\nreading. We have seen that Hans manifested his seeming knowledge of\r\nlanguage symbols in a threefold manner: he might approach a slate on\r\nwhich was written the symbol asked for, or he would indicate its\r\nlocation in a series of slates by means of tapping, or finally by means\r\nof so-called spelling of the word which was written upon a slate or\r\nplacard. The responses by means of approaching a placard were very often\r\nunsuccessful, while indications by means of tapping were scarcely ever\r\nunsuccessful. If it were true that higher intellectual processes[T] were\r\nhere involved, then the converse would have been expected, for tapping\r\nrequired not only the ability to read, but also the ability to count.\r\nIf, on the other hand, we assume that the horse simply followed the\r\ndirections given by the questioner's movements, this seeming difficulty\r\nresolves itself, for it would be more difficult for Hans to perceive the\r\nsigns which he receives while moving than those which he receives while\r\ntapping. When we recall that it was easier to direct the horse to a\r\nplacard near the end of a row than one nearer the center (see page 81),\r\nwe can readily understand how it was that during the experimentation\r\ncarried on by the September-Commission (Supplement III; page 255), Hans\r\nwas able to point out immediately the placards on which were written the\r\nnames \"Castell\" and \"Stumpf\", for they were at the two extreme ends, but\r\nwas unsuccessful in locating the one on which was written the name\r\n\"Miessner\" which was not a bit more difficult to read, but was located\r\nat the fourth place in the row. He first approached the fifth card, then\r\nupon repetition of the test he pointed out the other neighboring tablet,\r\nviz., the third.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote T: Professor Shaler[24], a well-known American savant,\r\n    mentions a three-year old pig belonging to a Virginian farmer, that\r\n    was able to read and had some understanding of language. From\r\n    numerals which were written upon cards and spread out before it,\r\n    this pig could compose dates. It could also select from among\r\n    certain cards one upon which was written a given name, asked for by\r\n    the master. Supposedly no signs of any kind were given. (Shaler\r\n    thought to exclude effectively the sense of smell, which is so\r\n    highly developed in the pig, in that he, Shaler, himself smelled at\r\n    the cards, since he also \"possessed an acute olfactory sense!\")\r\n    Since we are told that the farmer in question made a business of\r\n    supplying trained pigs for exhibition purposes, the case appears\r\n    suspicious. We hear of a pig exhibited in London, that was able to\r\n    read and spell, and could also tell the time by the watch[25]. We\r\n    cannot tell, however, whether the two pigs, which beyond a doubt\r\n    were mechanically trained to respond to signals, are identical or\r\n    not.]\r\n\r\nIn spelling, Hans was quite indifferent whether his table with the\r\neighty-four number signs upon it stood before him, for he had no\r\nknowledge of letters. Neither Mr. von Osten nor Mr. Schillings required\r\nit, for the former knew the table by heart and Mr. Schillings told me\r\nthat before every test he made a note of the numbers which were\r\nnecessary to indicate the required letters, trusting in this way to\r\ncontrol the responses of the horse and never guessing that by so doing\r\nhe was making it possible for the horse to answer correctly. The\r\nnewspaper reports aroused much interest at the time by stating that Hans\r\nwas able to spell such proper names as \"Plueskow\" and \"Bethmann-Hollweg\",\r\neven to putting in the difficult \"w\" and \"th\". The friends of Mr. von\r\nOsten at the same time called attention to the exquisite auditory\r\nacuteness of the horse which enabled him to perceive the aspirated \"w\"\r\nand to discriminate between the \"th\" and \"t\", (the \"th\" is softer than\r\nthe \"t\" in German.--_Translator_). This explanation, of course, must\r\nhave appeared somewhat daring even at that time.\r\n\r\nHans was quite guiltless of the many limitations imputed to him\r\nconcerning his knowledge of symbols. That he was unable to read capitals\r\nor Latin script was merely a vagary of the master, like the belief that\r\nit was necessary to confine one's self in one's questions to a certain\r\nvocabulary and to a certain form. Mr. von Osten's apparent failure to\r\nelicit responses from the horse on topics of which it was ignorant is a\r\nbeautiful illustration of the power of imagination. Mr. von Osten was\r\nconvinced from the very first that Hans could not answer such questions.\r\nWhen the belief in success was lacking, of course there was not the\r\nrequisite amount of concentration which, alone, leads to perceptible\r\nexpressive movements and thus elicits a successful reaction on the part\r\nof the horse.\r\n\r\nMr. Schillings, owing to his great impressionability, remained long\r\nunder the spell of Mr. von Osten's point of view. Thus I find in the\r\nrecord of the September-Commission that the question \"How much is 3 plus\r\n2?\" was answered incorrectly by Hans, but he responded correctly the\r\nmoment Mr. Schillings replaced the word \"plus\" which was \"tabooed\", by\r\nthe word \"and\". For a long time also he could receive no response to\r\nquestions put in French until one day he made the discovery that,\r\ncuriously enough, the animal never responded adequately unless he\r\nhimself firmly believed in the possibility of success. It is noteworthy\r\nthat the Count zu Castell, independently of Mr. Schillings, made the\r\nsame discovery. Mr. Schillings made his curious discovery--which he was\r\nunable to interpret, but which aroused some suspicion--on the following\r\noccasion. One day--whether accidentally or because his prejudice was\r\ntemporarily overcome--he commanded; \"Dis deux!\". Hans responded promptly\r\nwith 2 taps. He was greatly surprised and believed that Hans had gotten\r\nhold of the French by hearing it spoken in his environment. Possibly he\r\nunderstood also \"trois\" and \"quatre\"? He put the questions and received\r\ncorrect responses. He asked again, \"dix\", \"vingt\", and so on to\r\n\"soixante\". At \"soixante-six\" he became doubtful. Indeed, Hans failed\r\nhim. At \"quatre-vingt\", the game began again. \"Cent\", again, succeeded.\r\nThe old saying that \"Faith will move mountains\" was verified once\r\nmore.[U]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote U: It has been scientifically proven that a number of\r\n    supposed mystical phenomena, table-moving, table-rapping, and\r\n    divination by means of the rod, all are the result of involuntary\r\n    movements made unawares by those concerned, just as in the case of\r\n    this work with Hans. (We must of course except those not infrequent\r\n    instances in which the phenomena in question are purposely and\r\n    fraudulently simulated.) There is this difference, however, that\r\n    there the thing affected is a lifeless object,--the table or the\r\n    rod,--here it is a living organism, the horse; hence there the\r\n    immediate effect of the movement is physical work in the form of\r\n    energy expended in moving the table, here the movement becomes a\r\n    visual stimulus. A number of observations which I find in the\r\n    relevant literature, and which I shall introduce into this chapter,\r\n    may serve to show how close is the similarity between the two cases,\r\n    how much depends upon the questioner, and how little really upon the\r\n    instrument--whether table or horse--which is acted upon.\r\n\r\n    Two examples will suffice to illustrate the significance of belief\r\n    and of the concentrated attention that results from it. The first is\r\n    taken from the letters of Father P. Lebrun on the divining rod[26],\r\n    which appeared in 1696. An old woman once told a treasure-seeker\r\n    that she had always heard that a treasure was buried at a certain\r\n    place in the fields. The man, who was known as an expert in the art\r\n    of using the divining rod, immediately set out to locate the gold.\r\n    Lo, and behold, the moment he set foot on the spot described by the\r\n    old woman, the branch turns downward, and from its movements the man\r\n    gathers that twelve feet below ground there lies buried some copper,\r\n    silver and gold. He calls a peasant to dig a pit eleven feet deep,\r\n    then he sends him away so that no other should get into the secret.\r\n    He himself digs a foot deeper, but all in vain, for he finds\r\n    nothing. Standing in the pit, he again takes up the branch. Again it\r\n    moves, but this time it points upward, as if to indicate that the\r\n    treasure had disappeared from the earth. Dismayed, he climbs out of\r\n    the pit and questions the branch a third time. This time it points\r\n    downward once more. He climbs back into the pit. Presently he feels\r\n    the prick of conscience (for in the 17th century many regarded the\r\n    dipping of the divining rod as the work of the Devil). Terrified, he\r\n    exclaims: \"O God, if the thing I am doing here is wrong, then I\r\n    renounce the Evil One and his rod (s'il y a du mal, je renonce au\r\n    demon et a la baguette)\". Having spoken, he once more takes the rod\r\n    in hand to test it. It does not move. Horrified, for now there was\r\n    no longer any doubt that Satan was the cause of its movements, the\r\n    man makes the sign of the cross and runs away. But he had hardly\r\n    gone more than two or three hundred paces when the thought strikes\r\n    him: Is it really true that the branch will no longer move for him?\r\n    He throws a coin to the ground, cuts a branch from a bush nearby,\r\n    and is overjoyed when he notes how it dips down toward the money.\r\n\r\n    Another example is to be found in a report of the well-known\r\n    physicist, Ritter[27], of Munich, which appeared during the early\r\n    part of the 19th century. Ritter, a man with a bent for natural\r\n    philosophy and metaphysics, describes an instrument which was to\r\n    replace the divining rod, and which he called \"balancier.\" It was\r\n    simple enough, consisting of a metal strip that was balanced\r\n    horizontally upon a pivot, and was supposed to be put into motion in\r\n    the presence of metals. Ritter used this instrument in his numerous\r\n    experiments with the Italian Campetti, a man who had achieved a\r\n    measure of fame in Europe for his ability to discover springs and\r\n    metals by the use of the divining rod. Carrying the \"balancier\" on\r\n    the tip of the middle finger of his left hand, Campetti--whose\r\n    integrity one cannot cavil at--had to touch repeatedly a plate of\r\n    zinc or pewter, and had to count aloud the number of touches he\r\n    made. The following curious law was found to obtain (that was\r\n    probably suggested to the subject by Ritter without his being aware\r\n    of it): with the first contact the \"balancier\" turns to the left,\r\n    with the second to the right, and with the third it remains at rest.\r\n    At 4 it turns once more to the left, at 5 to the right, at 6 it\r\n    remains at rest, etc. It remained immovable only at the so-called\r\n    trigonal numbers (3, 6, 9, 15, 21, etc.). Ritter tells us that when\r\n    Campetti did not really count or did not think of the number, then\r\n    it would not have any influence whatever upon the action of the\r\n    instrument. This Ritter ascribes to the agency of electricity (which\r\n    in the 18th and 19th centuries was made to play very much the same\r\n    role that Satan had played in the 16th and 17th centuries).\r\n\r\n    The similarity of these two cases and that of Mr. Schillings is\r\n    evident. When the questioner of the horse and the bearers of the\r\n    \"balancier\" and of the divining rod are confident of success, they\r\n    succeed. When they do not expect success, they fail.]\r\n\r\nHans's seeming knowledge of the value of coins and cards, of the\r\ncalendar and the time of day, as well as his ability to recognize\r\npersons or their photographs, can now be readily understood. In all of\r\nthese cases, we had to deal, in so far as knowledge is concerned, only\r\nwith that of the questioner,--the horse simply tapped the number the\r\nquestioner had in mind. The meaning which was supposed to be expressed\r\nby the tapping never existed as far as Hans was concerned; it was only\r\nin the mind of the questioner that the concepts: ace, gold, Sunday,\r\nJanuary, were associated with \"1\", etc. The same was true with regard to\r\nall other wonderful feats of memory. The sentence: \"Bruecke und Weg sind\r\nvom Feinde besetzt\", (The road and the bridge are held by the enemy),\r\nwhich was given to the horse one day and correctly repeated by him on\r\nthe following day, was not an answer elicited from the horse by means of\r\na question, but rather a system of automatic reactions which were\r\ninduced by certain involuntary movements of the questioner as stimuli.\r\nFar from showing a wonderful memory in these feats--as is claimed for\r\nhim by the very non-critical compiler, Zell[28]--Hans, on the contrary,\r\nhas at his service a remarkably small number of associations. For,\r\nbesides possessing the powers of any ordinary horse, he recognizes only\r\na few meager visual signs. To be sure, we find in the literature a horse\r\nthat was said to have recognized 1500 signals,[29] but all proof is\r\nlacking and the report is so meager that we cannot discover whether\r\nthese signs were auditory or visual.[V]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V: The French investigators Vaschide and Rousseau make a\r\n    reference to this case, and mistakenly state the number of signals\r\n    as 1500 instead of 115[30]. Ettlinger[31] takes over this wrong\r\n    figure and makes the additional mistake of assuming that the\r\n    reference is to an original investigation made by the two\r\n    Frenchmen.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus disposed of all questions concerning the horse's apparent\r\nfeats of reason and memory, let us turn to those in the field of\r\nsensation. We shall begin with vision. That Hans was unable to select\r\ncolored pieces of cloth merely upon the basis of color quality, without\r\nreference to their order, was shown in Chapter II. It would, however, be\r\nsomewhat hasty to infer color-blindness from this fact, as did\r\nRomanes[32] on the basis of similar unsucessful responses on the part of\r\na chimpanzee (\"Sally\" of the London Zooelogical Garden). It is much\r\neasier to explain the failure of the horse than that of the monkey on\r\nthe basis of intellectual poverty, a poverty of associative activity. It\r\npresumably can discriminate between the various colors, but it cannot\r\nassociate with these their names. The existence of chromatic vision in\r\nthe lower forms is by no means as unquestionable as is assumed by\r\npopular thought. Even teleological considerations which are often\r\nbrought forward (especially that of the ornamental and protective\r\ncoloring of so many animals) can never do more than establish a certain\r\nprobability. For definite proof, we need data given by observation (we\r\nhave none in this case), or experimental evidence. Such evidence we\r\nhave, but it is insufficient in quantity and unfortunately most of it\r\nwas obtained under inadequate experimental conditions.[W] We know\r\nnothing regarding chromatic vision in the horse, though we have often\r\nhad trained horses which apparently possessed color discrimination. The\r\nearliest report of this kind I find in a work published in the year\r\n1573.[36] Here we read that a number of Germans exhibited two horses in\r\nRome which could, upon request of their masters, point out those persons\r\namong the spectators who were wearing stockings of any designated color.\r\nThe passage, \"conoscevano i colori\", (they recognized the colors,)\r\nproves nothing and no one has ever heard, even in modern times, of a\r\nhorse that actually knew colors.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote W: All told, there are hardly more than half dozen\r\n    experimental investigations of the color-sense in mammals,--to speak\r\n    only of these. Three of them deserve especial mention. One, the work\r\n    of the American, Kinnaman,[33] on two Rhesus monkeys. Then a brief\r\n    but careful piece of work by Himstedt and Nagel.[34] These two\r\n    investigators were able to determine that their trained poodle could\r\n    distinguish red of any tone or shade from the other colors, and from\r\n    Professor Nagel I learned that later the tests were extended and the\r\n    same was shown to be true concerning the blue and the green. And\r\n    finally there is an investigation which hitherto has been known only\r\n    from a reference which Professor Dahl,[35] the investigator, himself\r\n    makes. The work is on a monkey, Cercopithecus (Chlorocebus)\r\n    griseoviridis Desm. (Professor Dahl has kindly allowed me to look\r\n    over the records of the experiments. He intends to publish the\r\n    monograph at an early date.)\r\n\r\n    All of these investigators arrive at the conclusion that the animals\r\n    tested by them possess color-sense. The monkey last-mentioned shows\r\n    one peculiarity: it was unable to distinguish a saturated blue from\r\n    the black. It will require further tests to clear this up.]\r\n\r\nNor did Hans possess anything like that high degree of visual acuity\r\nwhich had been attributed to him. He was supposed to be able to read\r\neasily at a distance small, almost illegible script, which we ourselves\r\ncould decipher only with the greatest difficulty close at hand. It was\r\nalso supposed that he could distinguish ten-and fifty-pfennig pieces\r\nwhose faces had become worn beyond recognition for us. None of these\r\naccomplishments have stood the test. We have no reason to believe that\r\nHans can see the objects about him more clearly than other horses,\r\nregarding whom one usually assumes that they receive only vague visual\r\nimpressions. Horses do not as a rule seem to be near-sighted as is often\r\nasserted by the layman, but rather somewhat far-sighted, or if we may\r\nbelieve Riegel,[37] who tested some six hundred horses, they probably\r\nhave normal vision. But we are told that many horses--and according to\r\nsome authors all--have an innate imperfection which detracts\r\nconsiderably from the clarity of vision. This imperfection consists in\r\nan irregular formation of the sclerotic coat and of the lens of the\r\neye.[38] The two organs do not have the same refraction in all parts. As\r\na result, objective points are not imaged as points upon the retina.\r\n(Hence the name: astigmatism, i. e., \"without points\", for this\r\ndisorder.) The retinal image of the object is not only vague, but also\r\ndistorted.[X]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote X: There is no justification for the wide-spread belief\r\n    that the horse which on account of the greater size of his eye (more\r\n    correctly, on account of the greater focal distance) receives larger\r\n    retinal images of objects than does the human eye, for that reason\r\n    also sees objects, larger than we do. Horses' shying is often\r\n    explained in this way. But the conclusion just mentioned is\r\n    erroneous. The retinal image is not the perceptual image. It\r\n    undergoes many transformations within the nervous system itself.]\r\n\r\nMany will doubt whether with such imperfect images an animal can react\r\nto directives so minute, as we have asserted to be true in the case of\r\nHans. In considering this question we must distinguish between the\r\ndirectives for pointing out colors and the directives for tapping and\r\nfor head movements on the part of the horse. In pointing out and\r\nbringing forth pieces of colored cloth there is involved the perception\r\nof an object at rest, viz.: the direction of the questioner who is\r\nstanding quietly; whereas in the case of responses by means of tapping\r\nthe stimulus is the horse's perception of the questioner's movements.\r\nNow, the construction of the horse's eye, as described above, is not\r\nfavorable for the perception of objects (so-called acuity of vision).\r\nThis may partly account for the slight success of the horse in those\r\ntests in which he was required to select a piece of cloth of a\r\ndesignated color, in so far as these commands were not accompanied by\r\ncalls or exhortations. Where human observers averaged eighty per cent\r\ncorrect responses (page 135), Hans, under similar conditions was\r\nsuccessful in only one-third of the tests. In his errors he was also\r\nwider of the mark than were the human observers (page 82). The object\r\nperceived, to be sure, is a large one, viz.: the questioner, and he at\r\nclose range. We must therefore consider more specifically what are the\r\ndetermining factors that make for success or failure of the response.\r\nFirst of all, the innocent questioner very often did not designate the\r\ndirection with sufficient clearness. Furthermore, Hans presumably was\r\nnot able to discriminate sufficiently between the direction of the\r\nexperimenter's eye and that of his head, which two directions did not\r\nalways coincide. Finally the horse's attention was often diverted, while\r\nhe was running toward the piece indicated, by the other pieces lying to\r\nthe right and to the left, and for this reason the addition of a single\r\npiece to the otherwise unchanged row of five pieces tended to decrease\r\ngreatly the chances of success.\r\n\r\nThe case is different with the perception of the directive signs for\r\ntapping, for nodding and shaking the head, etc., all of which require\r\nthe perception of movements. This is not necessarily more difficult on\r\naccount of the imperfect constitution of the tissues that serve for the\r\nrefraction of light. Some authors even aver that this facilitates the\r\nperception of moving objects. This view was first advanced by the\r\nexcellent ophthalmologist, R. Berlin[39] of Stuttgart. In arriving at\r\nthis view he was guided by the following considerations. The peculiar\r\nform of astigmatism of the lens of the horse's eye, which Berlin has\r\ndescribed as \"butzenscheibenfoermig\",[Y] because it appears in the form\r\nof a series of glossy concentric circles around the lens nucleus, has\r\nthe property of enlarging the pathway (and with it the rapidity) of\r\nmoving retinal images. If we take a speculum by means of which a view\r\nmay be had of the interior of the eye, and fixate a definite point on\r\nthe retina of the horse, and then make a slight movement of the head\r\nhorizontally, we find that the point fixated moves--apparently at\r\nleast--toward the border of the pupil. In a normally constructed eye\r\nthis seeming movement will be in a straight line, while in the eye of\r\nthe horse, (according to Berlin), its path is curved, and therefore\r\nlonger. Berlin believes that the same thing which here occurs in the\r\ncase of this merely apparent movement, must also happen when an external\r\nmoving object is imaged on the horse's retina. Its pathway, too, will be\r\ncurved, and therefore longer, so that if the head of Mr. von Osten moves\r\npast the animal's eye, then the image on the horse's retina will take a\r\nlonger, more circuitous route than it would if the eye were not\r\nastigmatic. We cannot, however, immediately conclude from the fact that\r\nan objective movement is imaged as being greater in extent on the\r\nretina, that it will therefore be more readily perceived by much less\r\nthat it will appear greater to, the horse, than would be the case if the\r\nlens were normally constructed. The visual percept is not immediately\r\ndependent upon the retinal processes, for between the two are\r\ninterpolated complex, inaccessible nervous processes. Still, Berlin\r\nbelieves that he is justified in drawing this conclusion from a number\r\nof relevant considerations. Accepting it, he believes that it would be\r\npossible for the horse to perceive movements, that for the human eye,\r\nwhich is not subject to this form of astigmatism, would lie below the\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote Y: \"Butzenscheiben\" are the small circular panes of green\r\n    glass, used in leaded windows in early days. They are high in the\r\n    middle (hence the name: \"Butze,\" a protuberance) with a number of\r\n    concentric circles around the central elevation.--Translator.]\r\n\r\nThis theory, the simplicity of which certainly must make a strong\r\nappeal, has been adopted by a number of well-known investigators\r\n(Schleich[40], Koenigshoefer[41]). If we also could accept it, then Hans's\r\nphenomenal power of perceiving the movements of objects would be\r\nexplained. But doubts arise which restrain us. Even if we were to accept\r\nBerlin's view in general, we should still come upon the following\r\ndifficulties. In the first place, it is questionable whether the\r\npeculiar form of astigmatism mentioned is indeed as common as he\r\nsupposes.[Z] The references in the literature are exceedingly meager on\r\nthis point. In order to make a few tests at least, I undertook to\r\nexamine nine horses with the aid of Dr. R. Simon, oculist, to whom I am\r\ngreatly beholden for the assistance given in these and other tests to be\r\nmentioned presently. In not one of the nine cases did we discover\r\nanything like the curved deflection which is supposed to be the sign of\r\nthe form of astigmatism in question. But in order to test objectively\r\nwhether Berlin's assumption were justified, we examined in the\r\nlaboratory fresh specimens taken from two horses. The eyes were fastened\r\nin a frame in what corresponded to their normal position. Their\r\nposterior spherical wall (i. e., their respective retinal surface) was\r\nreplaced by a piece of ground glass. On a spherical surface linear\r\nmovements of a point of light are always imaged as curves, no matter\r\nwhat the shape of the lens forming the image may be. (For a more\r\ndetailed statement see page 170, at close of note.) Since, however, our\r\ninvestigation had to do only with those curves which were due to the\r\nqualities peculiar to the lens, we had to replace the spherical by a\r\nplane projection surface. In front of the eye thus modified a strong\r\nlight was placed at such a distance that the image of it, produced on\r\nthe improvised back of the eye by the cornea and the lens, was a sharply\r\ndefined point of light. Now, when the source of light was moved, the\r\npoint of light would also move on the glass plate. Sitting at some\r\ndistance behind the eye, we observed the movements of this point through\r\na telescope. Thus we became witnesses of what happens upon the horse's\r\nretina when a moving object passes in front of his eye. Although we saw\r\nthe point of light move through relatively long distances both\r\nhorizontally and vertically, no sort of deflection in its pathway could\r\nbe noted. Berlin's exposition does not hold true for the eyes of the\r\nhorses, either living or dead, which were examined by us.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote Z: Since no opportunity was given us to examine Hans's\r\n    eyes we do not know what their condition is in this respect. Though\r\n    it would have been interesting to know, it would hardly make any\r\n    difference in the views presented. If Hans should prove to be either\r\n    far or near-sighted, then, if we are to make any supposition at all,\r\n    it would be that the defect could not be very great, since near\r\n    sightedness exceeding 2 or 3 diopters and far-sightedness exceeding\r\n    one diopter is seldom found in the case of the horse. According to\r\n    Mr. von Osten, Hans at one time manifested a tendency to shy easily.\r\n    Be this as it may, for little could be concluded from it, since in\r\n    many extremely shy horses, no kind of visual imperfection can be\r\n    discovered.]\r\n\r\nBut in the case of some of the horses in whom Berlin had seen the\r\nphenomenon for which we sought in vain, he himself tells us, the\r\ndeflection was very slight. In that case, it would appear, no great\r\nadvantage would be gained along the lines indicated. But even assuming\r\nthe degree of deflection to be very great, his theory goes to pieces on\r\nthe very point it was supposed to explain. A concrete example will make\r\nthis clear. If Mr. von Osten, standing two feet away from the horse,\r\nraised his head 1/5 millimeter (which figure by no means represents the\r\nextreme values that were obtained), then in the horse's retinal image\r\nevery point of the man's head would move through a distance of 0.0025\r\nmillimeter--assuming the horse's eye to be free from astigmatism and\r\nassuming its focal distance to be 25.5 millimeters. If, however, other\r\nconditions remaining the same, we presuppose an extreme form of\r\nastigmatism, one in which the path of the retinal image is not a\r\nstraight line, but is deflected into a semicircle, then each point would\r\npass through a distance of nearly 0.004 millimeter. If the sensitive\r\nretinal elements have a diameter of 0.002 millimeter (as Berlin,\r\nsomewhat inexactly, states), then from two to four elements would be\r\nstimulated in case there were no astigmatic deflection. But in case the\r\ndeflection did take place, it would not necessarily involve more\r\nelements, as can be seen by making a simple graph; indeed we can imagine\r\ncases in which the circuitous path would involve even fewer elements\r\nthan the straight one. And finally, when the movement which the horse is\r\nto perceive, does not occur in a straight line but in the form of a\r\ncurve, (which will generally be the rule), then the astigmatism will\r\ntend in many cases to decrease the curvature of the image's path on the\r\nretina, and sometimes even obviate it entirely. In all these cases, on\r\nBerlin's own theory, the perception of the movements would be hindered\r\nrather than aided.[AA]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AA: For the benefit of specialists I would say the\r\n    following in addition to the more general remarks just made. For the\r\n    most part, the determinations of refraction made on the eye of the\r\n    horse are still rather unreliable. In sciascopy there is a dispute\r\n    among investigators concerning ambiguous shadows, and in the use of\r\n    the refraction-ophthalmoscope no definite region of the eye's\r\n    background has been adhered to by the various investigators. It\r\n    appears that Riegel, whose diligent researches mentioned on page 164\r\n    were published in 1904, knew nothing concerning the round area in\r\n    the horse's eye, discovered by I. Zuern[42] in 1902. Also, if so\r\n    great a degree of astigmatism is really the rule as is emphasized\r\n    especially by Hirschberg[43] and Berlin,[44] then the simple\r\n    refractive index usually given--sometimes within a half\r\n    diopter--would be meaningless. Berlin[45] and Bayer[46] believe the\r\n    vagueness of the retinal image resulting from the astigmatism, is\r\n    offset by this: that the oval pupil functions as a stenopaic slit.\r\n    In view of the width of the horse's pupil this appears to me to be\r\n    rather hypothetical.\r\n\r\n    Concerning Berlin's theory of deflecting astigmatism I would say the\r\n    following: Of the two ophthalmoscopic signs mentioned as being\r\n    characteristic of this form of astigmatism,--the concentric circles\r\n    and the arcuate deflection of the pathway of the fixated\r\n    points,--when there is a movement of the eye of the observer (or of\r\n    the eye observed), according to Berlin the former is not so constant\r\n    as the latter. So far as I know, the concentric ring formation is\r\n    mentioned only by Bayer[47] and Riegel,[48] and is said to occur\r\n    principally in horses with myopic vision--and hence, relatively, in\r\n    a minority of cases. Judging from the particulars, we are inclined\r\n    to believe that a case of \"Butzenscheiben\"-lens reported by\r\n    Schwendimann[48_a_] is in reality a case of senile sclerosis.\r\n    Berlin repeatedly warns us against mistaking the one for the\r\n    other.[48_b_] The arcuate deflection, on the other hand, has not\r\n    been mentioned elsewhere as a personal observation. In Berlin's\r\n    calculation[49] of the increase in the extent of the retinal pathway\r\n    an ambiguity has crept in. He says that \"in the astigmatic eye there\r\n    are stimulated 207 times as many nervous elements as would be\r\n    stimulated in the ideally normal eye.\" It ought to read \"207 more\"\r\n    instead of \"207 times as many.\" And this number holds only for the\r\n    one case computed by Berlin, and under the specific assumption that\r\n    exactly [Greek: pi]/2 times the normal number of elements were\r\n    stimulated (571 instead of 364). Therefore the general statement\r\n    which Bayer[50] makes in his text-book, that according to Berlin's\r\n    evaluation \"207 times more nervous elements\" are stimulated in the\r\n    astigmatic eye than in the non-astigmatic one, does not hold true.\r\n\r\n    Closing this note, a few remarks concerning the experiments made by\r\n    Dr. Simon and myself. All of the nine horses were tested for the\r\n    vertical image by means of the ophthalmoscope. In most cases Wolff's\r\n    electric speculum was used. Atropine was not employed.--For the\r\n    laboratory tests the adipose and the muscular tissues were removed\r\n    from the eye-ball and the rear part of the bulb cut away. The front\r\n    part, containing the cornea and the lens, was fastened over one\r\n    opening of a metal cylinder which was closed at the other end by\r\n    means of a disc of ground glass. The whole, approximately as long as\r\n    a horse's eye, was filled with a normal salt solution whose\r\n    refractive index (1.336) corresponds quite closely with that of the\r\n    vitreous humor of the horse's eye. The pressure from within was\r\n    regulated so that on the one hand it was not dimmed and yet on the\r\n    other there were no wrinkles in the cornea. The source of light--the\r\n    filament of a Nernst lamp--was moved about in a plane 120 cm.\r\n    distant from the eye and perpendicular to the optic axis. It was\r\n    moved through the point of intersection as well as at various\r\n    distances from it. Movement in horizontal and vertical directions\r\n    was in each case along lines 150 centimeters in length, which would\r\n    correspond to an angle of vision of not less than 64 deg.. The pathway\r\n    of the imaged point was controlled by means of the cross-hairs of\r\n    the telescope. If in the same way we observe through the sclerotic\r\n    of an intact eye-bulb a point of light falling upon the retina and\r\n    shining through the sclerotic and choroid (which is not difficult\r\n    when we use an intense light), then to the observer its pathway\r\n    will, of course, appear to be deflected convexly toward the\r\n    periphery,--and the deflection will appear the greater, the farther\r\n    the point of light is removed from the optic axis.]\r\n\r\nBut to come now to the most pertinent objection. We saw that Berlin's\r\nwhole train of thought rested upon the assertion that it made no\r\ndifference whether we regarded by means of the speculum the seeming\r\nmovement of a fixed retinal point, or whether the image of an external\r\nmoving object is passing over the horse's retina. As a matter of fact,\r\nhowever, these two processes are very different from one another. In\r\nmoving the mirror, with its small opening we are looking through ever\r\nchanging portions of the horse's lens,--testing it out, as it were. The\r\nhorse, on the other hand, sees with all parts of the lens\r\nsimultaneously, in so far as the lens is not covered by the iris. The\r\narcuate deflection, which is nothing but a registration of the\r\ndifference in the indices of refraction of the different parts of the\r\nlens used consecutively, might thus be formed for the observer using the\r\nmirror, but never for the horse. For these reasons we cannot conclude\r\nthat the kind of astigmatism described can really increase the horse's\r\nacuity in the perception of movements.\r\n\r\nSince the light-refracting apparatus of the horse's eye does not offer a\r\nsatisfactory explanation for the extraordinary keenness of visual\r\nperception possessed by the Osten horse, we must go a step further and\r\nask whether it may not perhaps be found in the part immediately\r\nsensitive to light, the retina. That portion really would seem to be\r\nadapted to the perception of movements of minimal extent, and for this\r\nreason: it is more than three times as great in extent as the human\r\nretina, and the horse's retinal images are likewise larger owing to the\r\nposition of the nodal point. The cells of the retina that are sensitive\r\nto light, the rods and cones, might therefore be correspondingly larger\r\nthan those of the human eye, without thereby making the whole organ less\r\nefficient than the human eye. But the most recent measurements[51] have\r\nshown that the rods and cones of the horse's eye are more minute than\r\nours. Assuming that, in the case of the horse, as is presumably the case\r\nin human vision, the transition of a stimulus from one retinal cell to\r\nthe next already in itself induces a sensation of movement, then the\r\nhorse ought indeed be extraordinarily keen in the perception of moving\r\nobjects (provided that the horse's more minute cells are packed just as\r\nclosely as in the human retina). And besides, there are two specially\r\nadapted areas within the retina of the horse. The \"band\"\r\n(\"streifenfoermige Area\") which was discovered fifteen years ago by\r\nChievitz,[52] is a strip of 1 to 1-1/2 millimeters in width, traversing\r\nthe entire retina horizontally, and is noteworthy on account of its\r\nstructure and probably, too, on account of its greater efficiency. It\r\nmay have something to do with the accomplishments of the Osten horse;\r\nbut in how far it would be hard to say. The other noteworthy portion of\r\nthe horse's retina is the \"round area\" discovered some four years ago,\r\nlocated at the rear outer end of the \"band\", and it is the best-equipped\r\npart of the horse's retina and corresponds to the area of clearest\r\nvision, the yellow spot, in the human eye. But this round area need not\r\ncome in for consideration by us, for its location would indicate that it\r\nis used in binocular vision, that is, seeing with both eyes.[53] But in\r\nall our experiments the Osten horse observed only with one eye. That\r\ndoes not mean, however, that under other circumstances the round area\r\nmay not be of very great importance.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of our knowledge, all attempts at explanation are,\r\nof course, of the nature of hypotheses. If further investigations should\r\ndisclose this explanation to be untenable, then we would either have to\r\nsuppose some unknown power in the eye of the horse,[AB] or else seek a\r\ncause in the animal's brain. Further experiments on other horses would\r\nbe necessary in order to discover whether the species as a whole\r\npossesses this ability or whether only certain ones are thus endowed.\r\nThe former is of course more probable. In this particular case\r\nconditions were unusually favorable for the development of this\r\nability. We must bear in mind that in all probability Mr. von Osten's\r\nmovements very gradually became as minute as they are now, and that\r\ntherefore Hans at first learned to react to such as were relatively\r\ncoarse. Furthermore, his practice extended throughout four years and\r\nduring this time it was his sole occupation. Without specific\r\npredisposition, however, all this practice would have been utterly\r\nfutile. We can also readily appreciate how indispensable in the struggle\r\nfor existence a well-developed power of perceiving moving objects must\r\nbe to horses (and most other animals) living in their natural condition\r\nand habitat, in order to be aware of the approach of enemies, or, in the\r\ncase of carnivora, the presence of prey. In view of all these\r\nconsiderations we can readily see how it was possible that the horse,\r\nperhaps in spite of rather defective vision, could react with precision\r\nto movement-stimuli which escaped observation by human eyes.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AB: Koenigshoefer, who as we have already said, seconds the\r\n    explanation given by the ophthalmologist Berlin (and who confounds\r\n    \"Butzenscheiben\" astigmatism with the common, so-called regular\r\n    form), believes[54] that not only astigmatism but also the shape of\r\n    the blind-spot of the eye must be taken into consideration. This\r\n    portion of the retina, where the fibres of the optic nerve enter the\r\n    eye (and called \"blind-spot\" because there are no cells there that\r\n    are sensitive to light) is very nearly circular in man, but differs\r\n    in shape in the different species of animals. Koenigshoefer thought he\r\n    had discovered that a relatively elongated blind spot was favorable\r\n    to keenness of vision. If we place the mammalia in series on the\r\n    basis of their relative keenness of vision, he says, we would find\r\n    that this series is identical with the one in which they are grouped\r\n    with reference to the form of the blind-spot from the circular up to\r\n    the most elongated. (In such a series the marmot takes the place of\r\n    honor.)\r\n\r\n    This exposition is not very satisfactory, however. We cannot be sure\r\n    what he means by \"keenness of vision\" (\"scharfaeugigkeit\"). Is it\r\n    visual acuity in the usual sense of the term (as is said in one of\r\n    his passages), or keenness in the perception of the movements of\r\n    objects, (this would appear to be his real meaning), or both at the\r\n    same time. But whatever the significance he may put into the term,\r\n    any such attempt at grouping the lower forms must prove\r\n    unsatisfactory from the very start on account of the scant data\r\n    which we possess on visual perception in animals. The experiences of\r\n    the hunt upon which Koenigshoefer partly bases his view, are entirely\r\n    inadequate for such a purpose. This much is certain, that the Osten\r\n    horse, in spite of a blind-spot which, though somewhat oval, is by\r\n    no means very elongated, possesses an extraordinary acuity in the\r\n    perception of movements. Even if the parallelism mentioned by\r\n    Koenigshoefer were really shown to exist, it would not explain the\r\n    matter until it were also shown in what way keenness of vision is\r\n    dependent upon the shape of the blind-spot,--a portion of the eye\r\n    which is not immediately operative in the visual sensation at all.]\r\n\r\nWe can understand also the horse's never-flagging attentiveness when we\r\nrecall that self-preservation prompts eternal vigilance over against all\r\nthat is going on in the animal's environment. (In the case of Hans,\r\nhunger was at first the motive; later, habit did the work.) Furthermore,\r\nthe lower form is not hindered in giving itself over to its\r\nsense-impressions by the play of abstract thought which tends so\r\nstrongly to direct inward our psychic energy,--at least, in the case of\r\nthe cultured.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Hans still remains a phenomenon not only in excelling all\r\nhis critics in the power of observation, but also in that he is the\r\nfirst of his species, in fact the first animal, in which this\r\nextraordinary perceptual power has been proven experimentally to be\r\npresent. It has long been known[55] that horses could be trained to\r\nrespond to cues in the form of slight movements, which remained\r\nunnoticed by the layman, and this fact has been made use of by circus\r\ntrainers to its fullest extent. But such signs, I have discovered, are\r\nwithout exception, of a far coarser sort than those we have here\r\ndescribed, and they can be instantly detected by the practised observer.\r\nNor was it known to professional trainers that it was possible for the\r\nmaster to direct a horse to any point of the compass simply by means of\r\nthe quiet posture of the body. For this reason it was believed that no\r\nsigns could possibly be involved in the color-selecting-tests (cf.\r\nSupplement III, page 255). In this we have the support of some of our\r\nexperts, as is witnessed by the following extract from a letter of his\r\nExcellency Count G. Lehndorff, one of our best hippological authorities,\r\nwho at one time carefully examined the Osten horse. (The letter was\r\naddressed to Mr. Schillings, and I have permission of both gentlemen to\r\nuse it). In it he says: \"If the author's statements, in which you also\r\nhave concurred, are correct, and if, as a matter of fact, the horse\r\nreally does react to such minute movements as are absolutely\r\nimperceptible to the human observer, then we have indeed something quite\r\nnew, for hitherto no one would have believed that horses can perceive\r\nmovements which man cannot. But I am even more surprised by the\r\nexplanation of the color-selecting feats.--This too, is something\r\nabsolutely new. One would not have deemed it possible that a horse could\r\ndo anything of the kind simply by using the posture of a man's body as a\r\ncue to which it could react with such precision.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, even though both facts were new concerning the horse and had\r\nnot hitherto been proven experimentally regarding any other species,\r\nnevertheless something of this sort has been known concerning the dog\r\nfor some time. His ability to single out an object upon which his master\r\nhad intently fixed his gaze, was made the basis of a special form of\r\ntraining, called \"eye-training,\"[56] nearly one hundred years ago. The\r\ndog was taught to focus constantly upon his master's eyes and then upon\r\ncommand to select the object which he, the master, had been fixating.\r\nSuch a dog has been described by the naturalists A. and K. Mueller.[57]\r\nBut the master of the dog, unlike Mr. von Osten, would not permit anyone\r\nelse to work with the animal, and the two brothers, recognizing the\r\ntrick, were justified in adding that \"the whole affair aimed at\r\ndeceiving the public, and the dog's reputation was but a means of making\r\nmoney\". The success of such exhibitions appeared furthermore, to depend\r\nupon the close proximity of the trainer and the dog, whereas the\r\ndirection of the head (and even of the body) could very probably be\r\nperceived at greater distances also. At least we learn from a reputable\r\nsource that in the hunt, dogs can perceive from the mere posture of\r\ntheir master, what direction he intends to take.[58]\r\n\r\nBut a still more curious fact is this, that dogs, too, learn--evidently\r\nspontaneously--to react to the minimal involuntary expressive movements\r\nof their master. The first example mentioned in the literature on the\r\nsubject is that of an English bull-dog called Kepler, belonging to the\r\nEnglish astrophysicist, Sir William Huggins.[59] We are told that this\r\ndog seemingly could solve the most difficult problems, such as\r\nextracting square roots and the like. The numbers were indicated by\r\nbarking,--thus one bark was for one, two barks for two, etc. Every\r\ncorrect solution was rewarded with a piece of cake. Huggins states\r\nexplicitly that he gave no signals voluntarily, but that he was\r\nconvinced that the dog could see from the questioner's face, when he\r\nmust cease barking, for he would never for an instant divert his gaze\r\nduring the process. Huggins was unable, however, to discover the nature\r\nof the effective signs. This satisfactory, though still unproven,\r\nexplanation has been accepted by specialists, among them Sir John\r\nLubbock.[60] I, too, regard this dog as a predecessor of our Hans.\r\n\r\nA similar case is reported by Mr. Hugo Kretschmer, a writer of Breslau,\r\nin the \"Schlesische Zeitung\" of August 21, 1904. To him I am beholden\r\nfor a detailed written statement, which he has kindly permitted me to\r\nuse in this connection. The gentleman named, first trained his dog to\r\nring the table-bell, and this, by pressing the dog's paw upon the\r\nbell-button. When the dog had learned to do this independently, his\r\nmaster tried to teach him the rudiments of numbers, in such a way that\r\nthe animal was to give one ring of the bell for the number 1, two for 2,\r\netc. But these attempts failed utterly and had to be abandoned. But Mr.\r\nKretschmer had noticed that he was able to get the dog to ring any\r\nnumber which he, Mr. Kretchmer, might decide upon. (Success was always\r\nrewarded by a bit of bread and butter.) At first Mr. Kretschmer tried to\r\nimagine vividly only the final number, but failed thereby to elicit\r\ncorrect responses from the dog. But he did succeed when he tried making\r\na series of separate volitions. Thus for the number 5, he would \"will\"\r\neach separate push of the button on the part of the dog. Even so,\r\nhowever, he never got beyond 9, for then the dog would become impatient\r\nand would ring the bell continuously. Anything that diverted the dog's\r\nattention, such as noises, etc., also entailed failure. In these tests\r\nmaster and dog had faced each other, each gazing steadfastly at the\r\nother. Mr. Kretchmer was convinced, however, that the dog was not guided\r\nby any sort of sign, but rather by suggestion. He based his belief on\r\nthe following two observations. After some practice, he says, the tests\r\nwere also successful when he did not look at the dog, but stood back to\r\nback with it, or when he screened himself from the dog's view by\r\nstepping to one side behind a curtain. The tests were unsuccessful, on\r\nthe other hand, whenever he was mentally fatigued or had taken some\r\nalcoholic drink. The arguments do not appear to me to be adequate. If he\r\nturned his back upon the dog and no other observer was present, he had\r\nno means of knowing whether the dog did not, after all, peer around to\r\nget a peep at him. If others who knew the desired number, were present,\r\nthe dog might have gotten his cues from them. And there may be some\r\ndoubt whether the curtain adequately served the purpose for which it was\r\nintended. At any rate, it was added that all attempts to influence the\r\ndog from an adjoining room--which would thus exclude effectively all\r\nvisual signs--were utter failures. I am also strengthened rather than\r\nweakened in my belief, by the second argument which Mr. Kretschmer\r\nmakes, viz.: that mental fatigue or the use of alcohol on the part of\r\nthe questioner tends to make the result unsatisfactory. We noted a\r\nsimilar effect in the case of the horse (page 150), where a disturbance\r\nof the \"rapport\" between the questioner and the horse was invoked by\r\nsome by way of explanation. The facts were explained by us much more\r\nsimply. We attributed the result to the close correlation between the\r\ntype of mental concentration and the nature of the expressive\r\nmovements--a correlation which we have shown experimentally to exist. I\r\ncannot, therefore, subscribe to the view that this dog did not require\r\neither visual or other sensory signs. The tests which were made for the\r\npurpose of strengthening that view, are on a par, I believe, with those\r\nmentioned on page 45. And since auditory, olfactory, and other stimuli,\r\nthough not impossible, still are improbable, I believe that our Hans,\r\nHuggins's dog, and the one belonging to Mr. Kretschmer, differ from one\r\nanother only in this, that the first taps, the second barks, and the\r\nthird presses a bell-button.\r\n\r\nAnd finally I have access to a letter from the Rhine Province in which\r\nthere is a brief account of a dog that would promptly obey any command\r\nthat was given without a sound and supposedly without the accompaniment\r\nof the slightest kind of gesture. It is specially mentioned that the\r\nanimal steadily watched its master during these tests. The perception of\r\nthe slightest involuntary expressive movements is in all probability the\r\nsecret in this case also. Here, too, suggestion has been invoked by way\r\nof explanation, but there was not the slightest attempt made to find for\r\nit a more specific foundation, and we cannot suppress an objection based\r\non the matter of principle. It is incumbent upon anyone who uses a term\r\nso ambiguous, to define what content he desires to have put into it. If\r\nhe does not do this, he is giving us, instead of a concept, a bare word,\r\ninstead of bread, a stone.\r\n\r\nWhile we must reject the explanation based on suggestion,[AC] we\r\nbelieve, on the other hand, that we have here again, evidence of the\r\npresence of visual signs, given unwittingly and involuntarily, just as I\r\nam sure that they were involved in the two preceding cases, and\r\nsimilarly in the case of the Huggins dog. Since the effective signs were\r\ndiscoverable in none of these canine predecessors of Hans, an\r\ninvestigation would be desirable, based upon the insight gained as a\r\nresult of these experiments upon Mr. von Osten's horse. Unfortunately\r\nthis is impossible, since the dogs in question are dead. But others like\r\nthem undoubtedly exist in many places. We might mention that when Hans\r\nfirst came under the limelight of public attention, there was also\r\nfrequent reference to the Huggins dog, but he soon dropped out of the\r\ndiscussion again.[63] And this for two reasons. The dog never took his\r\ngaze from his master and appeared to be entirely dependent upon him in\r\nhis reactions. Hans, on the other hand, seemed to give evidence of a\r\nhigh degree of independence and never appeared to look at the\r\nquestioner. But we know now that, though he was never dependent upon the\r\nwill of his master, he, too, abjectly hung upon the man's involuntary\r\nmovements and never for a moment lost him from view. But since the horse\r\nis able to observe with one eye alone, and needed to direct only it and\r\nnot the entire head toward the questioner, in order to focus\r\ncomfortably, one could not conclude as to his line of vision from the\r\ndirection of the head. Since, furthermore, in the horse the pupil is\r\nhardly distinguishable from the darkly pigmented iris and since the\r\nwhite sclerotic is hidden by the eyelids, except when the eye is turned\r\nvery much, it is difficult to determine what direction the eye is\r\ntaking. I once purposely stepped backward to the horse's flank, so that\r\nhe had to turn his eye far back and thus the outer border of the iris\r\nand the white sclerotic coat became visible and all doubt concerning the\r\nline of vision was removed. This doubt could never arise in the case of\r\nthe dog, the median plane of whose head is always directed toward the\r\nobject fixated, and Zborzill is justified in saying, as he does, in his\r\ndiscussion of training of the kind mentioned on page 177, \"But any\r\ncareful observer can immediately guess the manner in which such a dog\r\nhas been trained.\"[64] If Hans had chanced to possess so-called\r\n\"glass-eyes\"--in which the dark pigment is wholly or partly lacking, so\r\nthat the black pupil is clearly defined against the lighter\r\nbackground,--then no doubt could ever have arisen concerning the\r\ndirection of the eye, and Hans never would have come to be regarded as\r\nthe \"clever\" Hans.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AC: I can find examples of supposed suggestion in the case\r\n    of animals given only by Rouhet.[61] He says that by means of\r\n    suggestion he taught a half-year old half-blooded mare-colt which he\r\n    had raised himself, to fetch and carry, and this in a very short\r\n    time. In order to indicate to the colt what was wanted, Rouhet would\r\n    concentrate with his whole mind upon the object intended (a watch),\r\n    and at the same time he would bend forward slightly. In the third\r\n    test, that is at the end of fifteen minutes, he had accomplished his\r\n    purpose, and in the tenth lesson, no more mistakes occurred. The\r\n    colt would fail to respond, however, as soon as he refrained from\r\n    making any gestures, or was in a laissez faire frame of mind, or\r\n    when he thought of other things. He therefore believes that there\r\n    must have been some kind of immediate, though inexplicable,\r\n    connection between the brain of the trainer and that of the horse. I\r\n    think the explanation is evident: the connection was not as he\r\n    thought, an immediate one, but arising through the mediation of the\r\n    man's attitude (\"attitude un peu baissee\"), and of his movements\r\n    (\"gestes\"), both resulting from his intense concentration (\"tension\r\n    de la pensee\").\r\n\r\n    In general we may say that, no matter what content we may wish to\r\n    put into the term \"suggestion,\" not a single fact has since come to\r\n    light which would justify, and much less demand, the application of\r\n    the term to lower forms, unless we would expand the definition of\r\n    the term to the extent of comprising every kind of command, every\r\n    arousal of ideas, whatsoever. But it would then be nothing but a new\r\n    name for old knowledge[62] and would lose all explanatory value.\r\n    (Hypnotism, so-called, in the case of horses, I shall discuss\r\n    elsewhere in another connection.)]\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of the December report, Hans acquired a reputation\r\nfor excellence in thought-reading and thus the discussion of\r\nthought-reading among animals in general became once more the order of\r\nthe day. That is to say that many of our domestic animals are--like the\r\nhuman mind-reader (a la Cumberland),--supposed to have the ability to\r\ninfer the thoughts of their masters from slight, involuntary movements.\r\nThey are thus aware when the feeding hour approaches, when they may go\r\nout in the open, etc. They also appear to be aware that their welfare\r\nlies in our hands, and therefore would seem to have a vital interest in\r\ndivining our intentions and our wishes. Not only our spoken words, but\r\nalso numberless movements--usually without our knowing it and often\r\ncontrary to our desire--speak a clear language. As is well said by the\r\nAmerican neuropathologist, Beard,[65] (who first explained the\r\nphenomenon of thought-reading, on the basis of the perception of very\r\nminute muscular jerks, and therefore called it \"muscle-reading\" or\r\n\"body-reading\"): \"Every horse that is good for anything is a\r\nmuscle-reader; he reads the mind of his driver through the pressure on\r\nthe bit,--though not a word of command is uttered.\" We know that in the\r\ncase of perfectly trained horses the rider's mere thought of the\r\nmovement which he expects the horse to make, is seemingly sufficient to\r\ncause the animal to execute it.[AD] Such cases are of course very much\r\nlike that of our Hans, excepting that instead of visual signs they\r\ninvolve aids of a mechanical nature, which, however, does not alter the\r\ngeneral principle, since both of them are of the nature of sensory\r\nstimulation. But we must not overlook the essential difference between\r\nthis so-called thought-reading on the part of animals and that which is\r\ndone by man. The human thought-reader can interpret movements, for he is\r\nfamiliar with the ideas which are their source. Thus when at the second\r\ntap, I notice a very slight jerk of the subject's head, and a stronger\r\none at the fifth tap, I infer that he thought of the problem 2+3=5.\r\nWhile the experimenter thus cannot be said to read thoughts, he still\r\ninfers them. The animal, on the other hand, we may be reasonably sure,\r\ndraws no such inferences. In its conscious life it remains ever on the\r\nsensory level. If we could ask Hans about it, he would probably answer:\r\n\"As soon as my master stoops forward, I begin to tap; as soon as he\r\nmoves, I stop. The thing which induces me to act thus is the carrot\r\nwhich is given me; what it is that induces my master to make his\r\nmovements, I do not know.\"--It is therefore erroneous to believe that\r\nanimals require the power of abstract thinking in order to utilize the\r\nsigns which are consciously or unconsciously given them, as is argued by\r\nGoldbeck[68] when he says with reference to the training for visual\r\nsigns, which we have already mentioned before: \"There the dog has\r\nconsciously interpreted the visual impression in terms of the conclusion\r\nthat he is expected to bring forth the leaf indicated.\" Nor was there\r\nany justification for the critic who thought he could put the essence of\r\nthe report of December, given in Supplement IV, into the following\r\nwords: \"He (Hans) showed that he has the power of attention, can draw\r\nlogical conclusions, and can communicate the result of his\r\nthinking,--and all this independently.\" Yet none of this had been\r\nasserted. The whole thing may be explained satisfactorily by means of a\r\nprocess of simple association established between the signs observed in\r\nthe master and certain reactions on the part of the horse. The fact that\r\nthe movements made were so exquisitely minute does not change the matter\r\nin the least. Such signs call for a high degree of sensory keenness and\r\ngreat concentration of attention, but by no means an \"extremely high\r\nintelligence.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AD: An illustration is given by Babinet[66] concerning the\r\n    horse of an English lord. Mr. Burkhardt-Foottit, also, that\r\n    excellent trainer, who has been master for more than forty of the\r\n    most highly-trained horses, tells us that while sitting on a\r\n    well-managed horse it sometimes happened that he had merely thought\r\n    of making a certain turn, when the horse immediately executed it,\r\n    before he, the rider, had to his knowledge given any sign or aid. An\r\n    observation belonging under this head is also made in Tolstoi's\r\n    \"Anna Karenina\"[67], this perfect mine of acute psychological\r\n    observation. In the famous description of the race we are told\r\n    concerning Count Wronskij riding his Frou-Frou just behind Machotin\r\n    mounted upon Gladiator, who was leading the race: \"At the very\r\n    moment when Wronskij thought that it was time to overtake Machotin,\r\n    Frou-Frou, divining her master's thought, increased her pace\r\n    considerably and this without any incitement on his part. She began\r\n    to come nearer to Gladiator from the more favorable, the near side.\r\n    But Machotin would not give it up. Wronskij was just considering\r\n    that he might get past by making the larger circuit on the off-side,\r\n    when Frou-Frou was already changing direction and began to pass\r\n    Gladiator on that side.\" Similar experiences might be gathered\r\n    elsewhere. Not infrequently the reflection of the rider that his\r\n    horse had not for a long time indulged in some trick peculiar to\r\n    him, will immediately call it forth; or doubts on the part of the\r\n    rider concerning the possibility of crossing some barrier, are often\r\n    the cause of the horse's fall or of his refusal to leap and of his\r\n    running away.]\r\n\r\nLet us turn now from the consideration of visual perception to that of\r\nauditory perception in the horse. We saw that the fact that Hans was\r\nable to respond to commands which were only inwardly enunciated, that\r\nis, commands which were merely thought of but not spoken, was not proof\r\nof great acuity of hearing, but rather that hearing was not at all\r\ninvolved. If Hans had been deaf he would, none the less, have promptly\r\nobeyed the commands. Blind and near-sighted horses try to overcome their\r\ndeficiency by means of the sense of hearing, and hence show a pronounced\r\nplay of ears. In the case of the Osten horse, however, attention has\r\nbeen diverted from auditory stimuli in the process of habituation to\r\nvisual signs, and as a result ear-movements are almost completely\r\nwanting. One is not of course permitted to deny _a priori_ that perhaps\r\nsome associations might have been formed between objects and the vocal\r\nsigns belonging to them, e. g., between the colored cloths and the names\r\nof the colors if both had been presented together oftener than was the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nBut there is a dearth of reliable observation as to how far auditory\r\nassociations of this sort may be established in horses. Usually the\r\nfollowing is cited. Horses learn to start off, to stop, and to turn\r\nabout in response to calls. They are able to distinguish properly\r\nbetween the expressions \"right\" and \"left\", or equivalent terms. Upon\r\ncommand they will start to walk, to trot or to run. And they also know\r\nthe name by which they are usually called. All authors agree that\r\ncavalry horses understand the common military commands; one writer even\r\navers that they excel the recruits in this respect.[69] Some believe\r\nthat in riding schools the horses pay closer heed to the calls of the\r\nriding-master than to the control of unpractised riders, even when the\r\ntwo are at variance with one another.[70] My experience with the Osten\r\nhorse and a number of other pertinent observations aroused in me the\r\nsuspicion that much that is called or spoken in the process of managing\r\na horse may possibly be just so much labor lost. In consequence I made a\r\nseries of relevant experiments. I have thus far tested twenty-five\r\nhorses of different kinds, from the imported Arabian and English\r\nfull-blood, down to the heavy draft-horse. The experiments were made\r\npartly in the courtyard of military barracks, partly in the circus, and\r\npartly in a riding-school or in private stalls. I am specially indebted\r\nfor kind assistance to Messrs. von Lucanus, Busch, and to H. H.\r\nBurkhardt-Foottit and E. Schumann, the two excellent trainers connected\r\nwith the Busch Circus. During these tests, the horses were always amid\r\ncircumstances familiar to them, whether free or bridled, under a rider\r\nor hitched to a wagon. All aids or signals, except the calls, were\r\neliminated in so far as it was possible.\r\n\r\nThe results of those tests were in substance as follows: Many horses\r\nreact to a smack of the lips by a rather fast trot. Many stop on the cry\r\n\"Hola\" or \"Brr\". This last was nicely illustrated in the case of two\r\ncarriage horses supplied with large blinders and held with a loose rein,\r\nand hitched to a landau. One of them regularly stopped when the \"brr\"\r\nwas given by the driver, whereas the other, which had not been\r\nhabituated to this signal, kept serenely on the trot, so that the\r\nvehicle regularly veered off the track--a sure sign that no\r\nunintentional aid was being given by means of the reins. Other horses,\r\nagain, were accustomed to halt in response to a long-drawn-out \"hola\",\r\nbut it was the cadence of melody rather than the word that was\r\neffective, since any other word, or even a series of inarticulate\r\nsounds, would produce the same result, provided they were given with the\r\nproper inflection. When this was changed, then the response would fail.\r\n\r\nThe result was not so apparent when it came to controlling the kinds of\r\ngait. One riding-school horse, when lunged and in a gallop, could be\r\ninduced by a friendly call--the word again was a matter of\r\ninconsequence--to slacken his pace into a trot and from a trot into a\r\nwalk. But this reaction was by no means very precise. Another, a\r\nfull-blood, contrary to the trainer's expectation and to his great\r\nastonishment, failed to respond to any kind of spoken command as soon as\r\nthe one who carried the reins refrained from making any movements which\r\nmight indicate what was wanted. (To refrain from all expressive\r\nmovements of this kind is by no means an easy matter). The slightest\r\nmove, apart from any help by means of the reins or the whip-handle, was\r\nsufficient to evoke a response. The results in the case of the military\r\nhorses, differed in many particulars. Thanks to the courtesy of Captain\r\nvon Lucanus I had the opportunity of testing three cavalry horses, two\r\ngeldings and one mare, aged nine, thirteen, and nineteen years\r\nrespectively, and all of them in the regiment ever since their fourth\r\nyear. They had been selected as the \"most intelligent\" in the squadron,\r\nand we were assured that they would obey punctiliously all the usual\r\ncommands. They were ranged behind one another, with the customary\r\ndistance of two horses' lengths between, and were ridden each by his\r\naccustomed rider. Both starting and stopping upon command were tested.\r\nThe horses were held by the reins, but the riders were cautioned to\r\nrefrain from giving any aid that might cause the horse to start when\r\nstarting was to be tested, or that might restrain him when stopping in\r\nresponse to the spoken command was to be tested. If a suspicion arose--a\r\nthing which happened only twice, however--that a rider had actively\r\naided in his horse's reaction, then an officer would mount into the\r\nsaddle. If it appeared that one of the horses was simply imitating the\r\nothers, then the others were purposely restrained by their respective\r\nriders. The commands were given by the corporal who usually had charge\r\nof the horses. In a few cases the sergeant of the squadron gave the\r\ncommands, but this made no difference in the success of the experiment.\r\nNow as to the results. Whenever the horses were trotting or walking, all\r\ncommands, without exception, were in vain. They effected neither an\r\nincrease nor a decrease in the pace. A result was obtained only when the\r\nhorses were standing when the test began; and this result was simple\r\nenough,--upon certain calls the animals would respond by beginning to\r\nwalk. This was the only reaction that was obtained. The most effective\r\nof the commands appeared to be \"Squadron,--march!\" But the command\r\n\"Squadron!\" or \"March!\" alone, were quite as effective; yet none of\r\nthese commands was obeyed without exception. Reactions were occasionally\r\nobtained in response to \"trot!\", \"gallop!\" \"retreat!\", (the usual\r\nintroductory \"squadron\" was purposely omitted here, because it alone\r\nsufficed to start the horses). But the reactions were always the same,\r\nviz., to start on a walk. Another series of commands (such as those\r\nwhich are addressed to the rider alone, e. g., \"Lances down!\") had no\r\neffect whatever; a certain amount of selection therefore did seem to\r\ntake place. In all these tests the order of the horses with reference to\r\neach other's position was repeatedly changed. One of the horses, the\r\nyoungest, and reputed to be the most \"intelligent\", (he was as a matter\r\nof fact the most spirited), gave evidence of a gregarious instinct,\r\nintensified by habit, which, if it had been overlooked, might have\r\nbecome a source of serious error. Not being accustomed to go at the\r\nhead, when so placed it started properly in only 18% of all such cases.\r\nWhen, however, (other conditions remaining the same,) he was put in\r\nsecond or third place, he started properly in 67% of the tests, and if\r\nwe take into account only those cases in which the three most effective\r\ncommands were used (\"Squadron!\", \"March!\", and \"Squadron--march!\") he\r\nreacted correctly in 91% of the cases. (The number of tests was 17, 36\r\nand 22 respectively for the three groups mentioned.) The horse,\r\ntherefore, almost always began to step properly when he stood behind one\r\nof his companions, but seldom when he stood at the head. And when he\r\nstood at the head and began to walk at the proper moment, it was plain\r\nthat it was a case of imitation and not initiative, for the horse was\r\nstill able to see the others, owing to the extent of his field of vision\r\nbackward, and he was always the last to move, whereas otherwise he was\r\nalways the first to move, and always difficult to restrain. So when the\r\nhorses to the rear were restrained or when the intervening distance of\r\ntwo horses' lengths was lessened, so that this gelding could not see the\r\none in the rear, he failed completely to respond. Accordingly these\r\nthree horses did little to justify the faith which their squadron had\r\nplaced in them.\r\n\r\nNow a few words on the manner in which horses react upon the call of\r\ntheir names. We are not concerned with those that are seldom or never\r\ncalled by name (such as those in the cavalry). I have not discovered one\r\nhorse that constantly and unequivocally reacted upon the mention of its\r\nname (though I would not assert that there are none that would do so.) I\r\nwas nearly always able to convince the owners or grooms, who at first\r\nhad maintained a contrary opinion, that any inarticulate sound was\r\ncapable of producing the same effect as the calling of the name. What\r\nthe significance of inflection may be, I am not at all certain. When a\r\ncertain one of a number of horses standing in the same stable was\r\ncalled, all of them responded by pricking their ears, raising their\r\nheads, or else turning about. For this reason the reaction of the horse\r\nspecifically called lost all significance. Likewise the call which is\r\nordinarily used in lunging when the man in the center of the circle\r\nwishes the horse to change its gait, or to advance toward him, also\r\nproved ineffectual as soon as the man inhibited every sort of movement.\r\nA slight nod, on the other hand, was always effective. Several times I\r\nhave tried to call horses to me, when they were free and running about\r\nin the arena, but was unsuccessful. After I had given them some sugar,\r\nhowever, they would always come to me--whether I had called or not--and\r\nwould then refuse to leave my side. But this is a matter of common\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nI would, however, regard all of these tests as merely provisional. In\r\nspite of the greatest effort, it was not always possible to control all\r\nthe conditions of the experiment, and furthermore, the number of tests\r\nwould have to be materially increased in order to yield an appreciation\r\nof the difference due to race, age, and the individual variation and\r\ntraining of horses. But we may, even now, be sure of one thing. Over\r\nagainst the certainty with which horses react to visual stimuli (in the\r\nform of movements perceived), it does not appear that the formation of\r\nauditory associations is greatly favored by nature in these\r\nanimals,--indeed, auditory associations are far less common than is\r\ngenerally supposed.[AE] Horses compare very unfavorably with dogs in\r\nthis respect. The latter easily learn to react with a high degree of\r\nprecision to auditory signs,--as I learned from a series of experiments\r\nwhich I was enabled to perform. The Osten horse, therefore, does not\r\nstand alone among his kind in his inferior auditory equipment, as one\r\nmight be tempted to believe at first blush.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AE: All the authors who have given practical suggestions\r\n    for the training of horses, whether free or with lunging reins, have\r\n    great faith in the efficacy of calls, but usually recommend a\r\n    mingling of calls and movements in the way of signs, (thus\r\n    Loiset,[71] Baucher,[72] von Arnim[73]). It therefore cannot be\r\n    stated just in how far the calls really effect anything. In other\r\n    cases I am inclined to doubt outright the influence which is\r\n    ascribed to the auditory signs. Meehan[74] gives an account of a\r\n    horse that was exhibited in London in the early 90's of the last\r\n    century. Pawing with his hoof, this horse apparently was able to\r\n    count and answer questions in arithmetic, and among other\r\n    accomplishments he was supposed also to be able to understand\r\n    something of language. In reality, however, he merely responded to\r\n    cues which were disclosed to the reporter by the trainer. In pawing,\r\n    the horse was guided by movements of the trainer, and in nodding or\r\n    shaking the head he reputedly got his cue from the inflections of\r\n    the man's voice. Is it not probable that in this latter case it was\r\n    the movements which accompanied speech that were alone effective in\r\n    inducing the nod or the shake of the head, so that the exhibiter was\r\n    deceiving not merely the public, but also himself? Perhaps we may\r\n    also doubt the exposition made by the well-known hippologist,\r\n    Colonel Spohr.[75] He tells us that it is easy to train horses to\r\n    raise the left foot or the right foot in response to the commands\r\n    \"Left--foot!\" or \"Right--foot!\" and that it will be the fore foot\r\n    when one is standing in front of the horse, and the hind foot if one\r\n    stands near the rear. It cannot be so very difficult, he thinks,\r\n    even to get the horse to understand the commands \"Left (or\r\n    right)--fore foot!\" and \"Left (or right)--hind foot!\"--and all\r\n    without any other aids but the spoken words. Should this really be\r\n    possible without even the slightest kind of designating\r\n    movement?----The following case, again, I believe is undoubtedly\r\n    based upon a misinterpretation. Redding[76] relates concerning his\r\n    nineteen-year old horse that he himself had owned for thirteen\r\n    years, and had always kept in single harness,----that this horse not\r\n    only understood the meaning of a long list of words, such as:\r\n    bureau, post-office, school, churchyard, apple, grass, etc., but he\r\n    also knew a number of persons by name, as well as their places of\r\n    residence. If he were told in advance to halt at a certain\r\n    residence, he would do it without any further aid from the driver.\r\n    For this reason the happy owner felt certain that the animal\r\n    possessed a high order of intelligence and \"that this horse does\r\n    reason.\" What sources of error were here operative, whether signs\r\n    were given by means of reins, or head or arm movements, could be\r\n    determined only by a careful examination of the case.\r\n\r\n    And finally we would exercise some reserve in entertaining the\r\n    suggestions for the acoustic education of horses which have come\r\n    from various sources. Colonel Spohr[77] whom we have just been\r\n    mentioning, thinks that it would not be a difficult matter to get a\r\n    horse to respond with a walk to one smack of the lips, with a trot\r\n    to two smacks, and with a galop to three, and then he could be made\r\n    to slacken his pace once more into a trot in response to one\r\n    long-drawn \"Pst!\" and to stop in response to two. Others have gone\r\n    even further. Decroix,[78] at one time leader in veterinary affairs\r\n    in France, conceived the idea of working out a universal language as\r\n    regards the commands that are given to horses, in the humane purpose\r\n    of sparing them the whip. He called it \"Volapuek hippique.\" For the\r\n    commands \"go,\" \"right,\" \"left,\" and \"halt,\" he suggests these: \"Hi!\"\r\n    \"Ha!\" \"He!\" and \"Ho!\" respectively. From these it was possible to\r\n    make eight combinations, such as \"Hi! Hi!\" for \"Trot!\" \"He! He!\" for\r\n    \"Left about\" (while the single \"He\" was to mean \"Forward, to the\r\n    left!\") \"Ho! Ho!\" for \"Back!\" etc. Decroix thought that the whole\r\n    system could be inculcated in a very few lessons. He even had a\r\n    medal struck which was to be awarded to the driver or rider who\r\n    should first exhibit a horse, thus instructed, to the Societe\r\n    Nationale d'Acclimatation de France (of which Decroix was\r\n    president). Eight years have elapsed since then, but we have heard\r\n    of no one who has earned the medal mentioned. In the future greater\r\n    care will probably be exercised in the putting forth of such\r\n    suggestions, and two sources of error may be guarded against, viz.:\r\n    involuntary movements on the part of the rider or driver, and\r\n    imitation of the horses amongst themselves. (One horse, guarded by\r\n    an experienced rider, may serve as copy for ten others with\r\n    inexperienced men in the saddle.)]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to explain the musical accomplishments. The tones which were\r\nplayed for the horse, were known to Mr. von Osten, since he himself\r\nplayed the harmonica, or when someone else played it, he, Mr. von Osten,\r\ncould see the stoppers. He then thought of the number which indicated\r\nthe tone in question, and Hans would tap it. Thus arose the tale of the\r\nhorse's absolute tonal memory. This tale gained much support at the\r\ntime, from an experience which has been recounted to me by the\r\nwell-known composer, Professor Max Schillings. It shows more clearly\r\nthan any other report how very confused were the threads that had been\r\nspun in the whole matter. In order to test the horse's musical ability\r\nProf. Schillings played, let us say, three tones upon the accustomed\r\ninstrument. Complying with Mr. von Osten's wish, Prof. Schillings always\r\nindicated which three he was about to play. The horse always tapped them\r\ncorrectly. In order to make a decisive test, Prof. Schillings then\r\nplayed, without anyone's knowledge, a note that was in reality a third\r\nbelow the one he had indicated to Mr. von Osten. Curiously enough, Hans\r\ntapped, as a matter of fact, the number indicating the note that was\r\nactually struck, and it was only in the third repetition and after many\r\nexhortations on the part of the master \"to have a care\", that the horse\r\nfinally tapped the number indicating the note Mr. von Osten had in mind\r\nand which in truth was the wrong one. This curious experiment seemed to\r\nthose to whom Professor Schillings communicated it, to yield conclusive\r\nevidence of the horse's absolute hearing. As a matter of fact, however,\r\nProf. Schillings had unwittingly, and, contrary to any intention on his\r\npart, inspired the horse. Standing, as he did, just behind the right\r\nshoulder of the horse, he was able to interrupt Hans (who had begun to\r\ntap in response to a move on the part of Mr. von Osten,) by means of an\r\ninvoluntary movement which did the work of a closing signal. At the same\r\ntime Mr. von Osten, likewise standing to the right of the horse and\r\nexpecting more taps, remained perfectly quiet. (This is as it was in\r\nthe tests, mentioned on page 71, in which, of two experimenters, one\r\nstarted the horse tapping, and the other stopped him.) Mr. von Osten\r\nvery probably lost patience after Hans had seemingly given the wrong\r\nresponse twice, and thereupon came nearer to the horse and thus by\r\nmonopolizing its attention--so as to exclude Prof. Schillings--he was\r\nable to get the response so ardently desired.[AF] When, in tests such as\r\nthese, two stoppers were opened and thus two notes sounded, Mr. von\r\nOsten would count the number of stoppers intervening between the two,\r\nand Hans would tap the number. And so arose the tale of Hans's knowledge\r\nof musical intervals. Whenever the two notes were sung or whistled, in\r\nwhich case there would be no stoppers that could be counted, then Mr.\r\nvon Osten, who was quite destitute of musical knowledge, was at a loss,\r\nand also Hans. If, however, the intervening notes were sung, then\r\neverything went smoothly once more. Major and minor chords were\r\nregularly characterized as \"beautiful\", all others as \"bad\", (but even\r\nhere errors occurred). A musician had taught Mr. von Osten these\r\ndistinctions. The old man also knew the melodies that were played on the\r\nhand-organ. Each one had a number assigned to it, and Hans was required\r\nto tap the number of the melody in token of recognition.--Hans was as\r\nignorant of musical time, as he was of melody, and all attempts to get\r\nhim to march in regular step were utterly futile. A number of musical\r\ntests were made in the absence of Mr. von Osten. In these Mr. Hahn\r\nundertook the questioner's role, and since he had had musical training,\r\nhe was aware of what the numbers should be, even when he could not see\r\nthe stoppers of the harmonica, and, therefore, we readily understand why\r\nit was that the horse responded so wonderfully in his case.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AF: General Noizet[79] has left us a story of the middle\r\n    of the last century, which in essential detail corresponds closely\r\n    with the one just given. The scene is a French chateau and the hero\r\n    is--a rapping table, highly prized on account of the intelligent\r\n    answers it could give. Seated about it were a number of ladies and\r\n    at the other end of the room sat a French savant, a member of the\r\n    Academy. The ladies requested him to put a simple mathematical\r\n    question to the table, and complying with their request, he asked\r\n    for the cube root of 4. None of the ladies who sat about the table\r\n    knew the solution; the table unhesitatingly gave 6 raps. This answer\r\n    was refused as incorrect. The table was asked to try again, and\r\n    again it wrapped 6. For this it was bitterly reproached. Hereupon\r\n    the questioner, who during the whole time had remained in his place\r\n    at the other end of the room, came forward with the confession that\r\n    the table was innocent, that he had made a mistake. He had asked for\r\n    the cube root of 4, but had really meant to ask for the cube of that\r\n    number, viz., 64, and the table had as a matter of fact given the\r\n    first numeral of that number.\r\n\r\n    One is immediately struck by the analogy between this case and that\r\n    of Professor Schillings. In both cases those immediately concerned\r\n    (the women in the one, Mr. von Osten in the other) believe that a\r\n    wrong answer is being given repeatedly. The cause of the error lies\r\n    in a person who seemingly is not concerned with the response. (The\r\n    Frenchman asked the question, but did not sit at the table.\r\n    Professor Schillings sounded the notes, but it was Mr. von Osten who\r\n    got the horse to tap.) In both instances the questioner asks one\r\n    thing, but had something else in mind. (With the Frenchman it was a\r\n    slip of the tongue; Mr. Schillings did it purposely.) And finally,\r\n    in both cases the response corresponds not to the question that has\r\n    been asked, but to that which has been thought, so that, though\r\n    seemingly wrong, the responses of both table and horse were really\r\n    correct. By way of explanation, Noizet believes that he has a case\r\n    of true thought-transference or \"telepathy\" (page 108). The\r\n    questioner watched with utmost attentiveness the rapping of the\r\n    table, and the women in turn regarded the man. And thus, Noizet\r\n    believes, the man's thought was transferred to the minds of the\r\n    others without the mediation of eye or ear, etc., and hence\r\n    unvitiated by the words that had been spoken. I myself prefer\r\n    another explanation. At that moment in which the rapping arrived at\r\n    the expected number, the Frenchman executed a movement\r\n    characteristic of release of tension and to this the women of the\r\n    circle reacted. It was not necessary that they should be able to\r\n    account for this afterward, (just as sometimes occurs in the case of\r\n    thought-readers[80]). It is very probable, too, that they were not\r\n    of a very reflective turn of mind anyway. We are warranted, I think,\r\n    in regarding the two cases as identical in kind.]\r\n\r\nThe so-called musical ability of horses appears, from all that is known,\r\nto be confined within very narrow bounds. Only one fact is universally\r\naccepted, viz., horses of the military are believed to possess a\r\nknowledge of the significance of trumpet signals, and are often said to\r\ninterpret them more readily than the recruits.[81] Since no experiments\r\nhad been made along these lines, I undertook to make a brief test of the\r\ncavalry horses mentioned on page 188. As in the preceding tests, the\r\nthree animals were arranged behind one another with the customary\r\ndistance of two horses' lengths between, and each was ridden by his\r\naccustomed rider. They were held by the reins, but received no aid of\r\nany kind, either to start them or to restrain them. A bugle then sounded\r\nthe various signals at the other end of the barrack's courtyard. We had\r\nbeen previously assured that the horses would certainly react without\r\nfail. But, as a matter of fact, the result was quite the contrary. Two\r\nof the horses did not move at all, and the third, a thirteen-year old\r\ngelding, was startled nearly every time and would tear off in a\r\ngallop--even though a trot had been sounded. I would not, however,\r\nventure to draw any conclusions from results such as these. Many more\r\ntests would have to be made, and some of them upon the whole squadron,\r\nbefore a judgment could be given.[AG]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AG: Professor Fluegel,[82] basing his statements on an\r\n    article appearing in \"Schorer's Familienblatt\" (Berlin, 1890, No. 8,\r\n    p. 128), gives an account of similar experiments which were supposed\r\n    to have been conducted by the Zoological Society for Westphalia and\r\n    Lippe, and presumably showed that \"the horses of the military do not\r\n    understand the bugle calls.\" No matter how well trained a horse may\r\n    have been, it would not respond to a signal. This report, however,\r\n    is due to a mistake. Such experiments have never been made by the\r\n    society mentioned, so I am told by its director, Dr. Reeker. Nor do\r\n    I know of any one else who has made experiments of this kind.\r\n    However, Professor Landois,[83] the eminent zoologist, now deceased\r\n    (founder of the scientific society mentioned), tested four\r\n    circus-horses for their musical ability and specifically for their\r\n    sense of musical time. He arrives at the conclusion that horses\r\n    \"have no feeling for time, whatsoever.\" With but few\r\n    exceptions,[84, 85] all experts to-day are of the same opinion.\r\n    Horse-trainers, especially, are universally agreed on this point. It\r\n    is easy to see in any circus performance that it is not the horses\r\n    that accommodate themselves to the music, but that the music\r\n    accommodates itself to them, and that the trained horses[86] are\r\n    induced to do their artistic stepping only by the aids given by\r\n    their riders. Furthermore, all these horses are trained without the\r\n    use of music.----It would therefore appear that the time had arrived\r\n    when the tales of the dancing horses of the Sybarites ought no\r\n    longer to gain credence. Two Greek writers, Athenaeus[87] and\r\n    AElian,[88] tell us that the inhabitants of Sybaris, far-famed for\r\n    their luxurious habits, had trained their horses to dance to the\r\n    music of flutes during their banquets. Building upon this, the men\r\n    of Crotona, in one of their campaigns against the Sybarites, ordered\r\n    the flute-players to play the tunes familiar to the Sybarite horses.\r\n    Immediately the well-trained steeds began to dance, thus throwing\r\n    the whole Sybarite army into confusion, and the men of Crotona won\r\n    the day. (The same story is told in more detail concerning the\r\n    horses of the inhabitants of Cardia. Both accounts, somewhat mixed,\r\n    are to be found in Julius Africanus,[89] a writer of the third\r\n    century of the Christian era.)--In recent years a French veterinary\r\n    surgeon, Guenon,[90] experimented on the effect of music upon the\r\n    horses of the military. He entered their stalls, playing upon a\r\n    flute, and noted their behavior. Four-fifths of the animals, he\r\n    says, were deeply moved, yes, delighted, even, (\"charmes.\" One\r\n    interpreter[91] calls it a case of hypnosis!). This emotional\r\n    excitement was expressed--somewhat unaesthetically--by the dropping\r\n    of excrementa. Guenon characterizes the feeling-state of these\r\n    animals as being a mixture of pleasure and astonishment, of\r\n    satisfaction and excitement (\"melange de plaisir et d'etonnement, de\r\n    satisfaction et de trouble.\") He also asserts that the horse's\r\n    musical taste is similar to our own. But I can find nothing in his\r\n    whole exposition which might prove this. Indeed there is nothing\r\n    that could be interpreted as anything other than a purely sensuous\r\n    effect upon the horses. I may go a step farther and say that thus\r\n    far the sense of music, i. e., understanding of melody, harmony and\r\n    rhythm, has not been shown to exist in any animal. Some animals may,\r\n    however, be susceptible to the sensuous pleasantness of the tones\r\n    themselves.]\r\n\r\nI shall now turn to peculiarities of character, highly humanized, which\r\nhave been attributed to Hans. His \"sympathies\" and \"antipathies\",\r\nso-called, were nothing but erroneous appellations for the success or\r\nfailure on the part of the respective individuals to elicit responses.\r\nHe who could procure answers frequently, apparently stood high in the\r\nhorse's favor. That Hans shook his head violently when asked by Mr. von\r\nOsten: \"Do you like Mr. Stumpf?\", and answered in the affirmative the\r\nfurther question: \"Do you like Mr. Busch?\", was nothing but a\r\nconfession--unwilling, to be sure--on the part of the master himself. In\r\nthe first case the master thought \"no\", in the second instance, \"yes\",\r\nand the two thoughts were accompanied by the corresponding head\r\nmovements, to which Hans responded mechanically. Hans appeared to be\r\nwell-disposed toward me, but evidently because I always rewarded him\r\nliberally when he answered correctly, and I did not scold him when his\r\nresponses were wrong, as did Mr. von Osten and Mr. Schillings, who\r\ninstead of seeking the cause within themselves, were always ready to\r\nrebuke Hans for his contrariety and fickleness. The horse did not show,\r\nin so far as can be judged at all, any real affection for his master. On\r\nthe other hand it would be unwarranted to say that, in spite of all\r\nrewards, he developed a grudge against all those who bothered him with\r\ninstruction and examination. Shortly after the close of our\r\nexperimentation it happened that Hans severely injured his groom by a\r\nblow in the face. Yet this man had always been very gentle with the\r\nhorse and had been forbidden by Mr. von Osten to make Hans solve any\r\nproblems for him. Experts assure me that we have here to deal, not with\r\na case of \"moral insanity\", but with a very common experience,--although\r\nthis view will probably be cavilled at by enthusiastic lovers of horses.\r\nThe work of so excellent an expert as Fillis,[92] for instance, bears us\r\nout in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe horse's supposed fickleness was nothing but a token of the fact that\r\neven those who were accustomed to working with him, did not have him\r\ncompletely in hand. (They simply did not understand how to obtain\r\ncorrect responses from the horse.) It often happened that in the\r\nevening, when it had become so dark that the movements of Mr. von Osten\r\ncould no longer be seen, Hans had to suffer bitter reproaches because he\r\nmade so many errors. That, in truth, he never was stubborn and that the\r\ncause of failure really lay in the questioner, is shown by the fact that\r\nthe mood, for which he was reproved, would disappear the moment the\r\nquestioner voluntarily controlled the signals. We may add that there was\r\nno basis for the assumption that \"he had an uncommon, finely constituted\r\nnervous system\" or was possessed of a \"high degree of nervousness\". Both\r\nthese phrases were often mentioned by way of explanation. Hans was\r\nrestive, as horses usually are. And besides, he lived a life so secluded\r\n(he was never allowed to leave the courtyard) that as a result he was\r\neasily disturbed by strange sights and sounds. There was not the\r\nslightest trace of the clinical symptoms of neurasthenia--on the\r\ncontrary he gave the impression of perfect health,--which was curious\r\nenough when we remember his rather unnatural mode of life.\r\n\r\nHans's stubbornness was a myth. He was suspected of it whenever the same\r\nerror occurred a number of times in succession, i. e., when the\r\nquestioner did not properly regulate his attention (page 146) or when he\r\nwas being controlled by \"perseverative tendency\", mentioned on page 149.\r\nMr. Schillings, who has provided me with material here as elsewhere,\r\nrelates the following episode which occurred on one such occasion. To\r\none and the same question put alternately by Mr. von Osten and Mr.\r\nSchillings, Hans responded correctly, with two taps, to the former, and\r\njust as persistently incorrectly, with three taps, to the latter. After\r\nMr. Schillings had suffered this to occur three times he accosted the\r\nhorse peremptorily: \"And now are you going to answer correctly?\".\r\nHereupon Hans promptly shook his head, to the great merriment of all\r\nthose present. (Mr. Schillings had, with no accounted reason, expected a\r\n\"no\".) Hans was called willful whenever the same question was\r\nsuccessively answered by different responses, as frequently happened\r\nwith the increasing tension that characterized the high numbers (page\r\n145). He was also regarded as stubborn when no reply at all was\r\nforthcoming, as in the tests with the blinders.\r\n\r\nHans's supposed distrust of the questioner, when the latter did not know\r\nthe answer to the problem, is nothing but a poor attempt to account for\r\nthe failure of those tests. Hans's distrust of the correctness of his\r\nown responses was supposed to be evident from his tendency to begin to\r\ntap once more if, after the completion of a task, the questioner did not\r\nimmediately give expression to some form of approval or\r\ndisapproval--just as a schoolboy begins to doubt his answer if the\r\nteacher remains silent for a short time. In terms of the results of our\r\nexperimentation this would mean that whenever the questioner did not\r\nresume the erect posture, after Hans had given the final tap with the\r\nleft foot, then the horse would immediately begin once more to tap with\r\nthe other foot (page 61).\r\n\r\nAs the evil characteristics, so, too, the good. Thus, his precipitancy,\r\nwhich was supposedly evidenced by his beginning to tap before the\r\nquestioner had enunciated the question, was nothing but a reflection of\r\nthe questioner's own precipitancy in bending forward (page 57). Never\r\ndid Hans evince the slightest trace of spontaneity. He never spelled, of\r\nhis own accord, anything like \"Hans is hungry,\" for instance. He was\r\nrather like a machine that must be started and kept going by a certain\r\namount of fuel (in the form of bread and carrots). The desire for food\r\ndid not have to be operative in every case. The tapping might ensue\r\nmechanically as a matter of habit--for horses are to a large extent\r\ncreatures of habit. This lack of spontaneity could hardly be reconciled\r\nwith the horse's reputation for cleverness. It would not be necessary to\r\ntouch upon the signs that were supposed to betoken genius: the\r\nintelligent eye, the high forehead, the carriage of the head, which\r\nclearly showed that \"a real thought process was going on inside\",--all\r\nthese, we said, would not need mentioning, if they had not been taken\r\nseriously by sober-minded folk. If there is a report that Hans turned\r\nappreciatively toward visitors who made some remark in praise of his\r\naccomplishments,--it is evidence only of the observer's imaginativeness.\r\n\r\nTurning from a consideration of the horse to that of the persons\r\nexperimenting with him,[AH] the first and most important question that\r\narises is this: How was it possible that so many persons (there were\r\nabout forty) were able to receive responses from the horse, and many of\r\nthem on the very first occasion? The answer is not hard to find. All of\r\nthese persons came to the horse in very much the same frame of\r\nmind--which found a similar expression in all, in both posture and\r\nmovements. And it was these motor expressions of the questioner (aside\r\nfrom the signs for \"yes\" and \"no\", which I believe I have adequately\r\nexplained on page 98), that the horse needed as stimuli for his\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AH: I cannot enter upon a discussion of the latest\r\n    psychological problems, here involved, partly because that would\r\n    take us beyond the purpose of this monograph, and partly because\r\n    they are still moot questions and hence not suited to popular\r\n    treatment. Briefly though, they are these: What is the nature of the\r\n    relationship between cognitive and affective states on the one hand\r\n    and involuntary, (so-called expressive) movements on the other? Is\r\n    this connection an external thing, as it were, an association\r\n    arising as a habit formation, or does every idea partake essentially\r\n    of a motor character? Do purely cognitive states give rise to such\r\n    movements, or does the movement impulse depend more particularly\r\n    upon the affective consciousness accompanying the cognitive states?\r\n    And in how far do given kinds of expressive movements depend upon\r\n    certain ideational types (c.f. page 95)? Thus, what is the\r\n    influence of the visual image upon the gestures for \"up,\" \"down,\"\r\n    etc.? And then, are these involuntary movements, when not noted,\r\n    truly unconscious, or merely not attended to,----in other words, are\r\n    they beyond the pale of consciousness or merely \"at the fringe?\" The\r\n    various writers speak almost without exception of unconscious\r\n    movements in the strict sense of the term. My own introspections,\r\n    however, have led me to doubt whether they are quite unconscious.\r\n    Since I have attained some practice I am able to describe in detail\r\n    (under conditions of objective control) my involuntary movements, no\r\n    matter how slight, even down to mere muscular tensions. None of my\r\n    subjects, however, has as yet succeeded in this. It is no very easy\r\n    matter to be on the lookout for some unknown movements which might\r\n    eventually occur, while attempting to concentrate attention to the\r\n    utmost upon a certain definite ideational content, for this very\r\n    dividing of attention effects a decrease in the force of the\r\n    movement, and thus makes it all the more difficult to discover. From\r\n    my own experience, however, I am inclined to believe that these\r\n    movements are not unconscious, but merely unattended to, in other\r\n    words, we have a narrowing down of the apperceived content within\r\n    certain limits, but not a narrowing down of consciousness, (much\r\n    less a \"splitting\" of consciousness or of personality as the thing\r\n    unfortunately has sometimes been called). In order, however, not to\r\n    be guilty of premature judgment, I have avoided the terms\r\n    \"unconscious\" and \"unattended to,\" and chose expressions which leave\r\n    these finer distinctions untouched.]\r\n\r\nThe next question that arises is: why did only a few persons receive\r\nresponses regularly from Hans, whereas the greater number were favored\r\nonly occasionally? What was the selective principle involved? The answer\r\nis, that the successful person had to belong to a certain type, which\r\nembodied the following essential characteristics.\r\n\r\n1. A certain measure of ability and tact in dealing with the horse. As\r\nin the case of dealing with wild animals, such as the lion, etc., Hans\r\nmust not be made uneasy by timidity in the questioner, but must be\r\napproached with an air of quiet authority.\r\n\r\n2. The power of intense concentration, whether in expectation of a\r\ncertain sensory impression (the final tap), or in fixing attention upon\r\nsome idea-content (\"yes\", \"no\", etc.). It is only when expectancy and\r\nvolition are very forceful, that a sufficient release of tension can\r\nensue. This release of tension is accompanied by a change in innervation\r\nand results in a perceptible movement. And it was only when the thought\r\nof \"yes\", or \"up\", etc., was very vivid, that the nervous energy would\r\nspread to the motor areas and thence to the efferent fibers, and thus\r\nresult in the head-movement of the questioner. From infancy we are\r\ntrained to keep all of our voluntary muscles under a certain measure of\r\ncontrol. During the state of concentration just described, this control\r\nis relaxed, and our whole musculature becomes the instrument for the\r\nplay of non-voluntary impulses. The stronger the customary control, the\r\nstronger must the stimuli be which can overcome it. The steady\r\nunremitting fixation, which resulted in the horse's selection of the\r\ncloths, also involves a high degree of concentration.\r\n\r\n3. Facility of motor discharge. Great concentration was necessary of\r\ncourse, but not sufficient. Persons in whom the flow of nervous energy\r\ntended to drain off over the nerves leading to the glands and the\r\nvascular system might betray great tension, not so much by movements as\r\nby a flow of perspiration (we have many excellent examples of this given\r\nby Manouvrier)[93] or by a violent beating of the heart, blushing and\r\nthe like,--in short, by secretory and vasomotor effects. Or it is not\r\ninconceivable that long dealing with very abstract thoughts might have\r\nweakened the tendency of overflow to other parts of the brain, and that\r\ntherefore the entire discharge is used up in those portions of the brain\r\nwhich are the basis of the intellectual processes. But if expressive\r\nmovements occur, the motor pathways must be particularly unresisting in\r\norder to take up the overflow of psychophysic energy. This is the\r\nnecessary condition for obtaining the tapping and the head movements on\r\nthe part of the horse, although for the tapping there is still one other\r\ncircumstance necessary: viz.,\r\n\r\n4. The power to distribute tension economically--i. e., the ability to\r\nsustain it long enough, and to release it at the right moment (after the\r\nmanner of the curves described on page 93), and to control properly the\r\nunavoidable variations which will occur.[AI]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AI: The mental state just described is probably\r\n    essentially the same as that of the spiritualistic \"mediums\" when\r\n    they are occupied with table-rapping and table-moving. In both cases\r\n    concentration is very intense,----in other words, the field of\r\n    attention is limited. We saw that this state not only favors the\r\n    tendency toward involuntary movement, but on account of the\r\n    absorption of the individual's attention by a certain limited\r\n    content, the person will be unaware of the voluntary movements as\r\n    they occur. And we are not necessarily here dealing with\r\n    neurasthenic, hysteric, or other diseased nervous conditions. In the\r\n    case of table-rapping there are movements of the hands, in our case\r\n    there are those of the head. Our head, balanced as it is upon the\r\n    cervical vertebral column, is continually in a state of unstable\r\n    equilibrium and therefore peculiarly susceptible to\r\n    movement-impulses of every kind. But I could induce not only\r\n    movements of the head, but also of the arms and legs, and this by\r\n    having the subject assume a posture which enabled him to hold arms\r\n    or legs in as unstable a position as possible. He might stretch out\r\n    his legs horizontally before him, or he could raise them vertically\r\n    upward as in the hand-stand in gymnastic work. An extract from a\r\n    treatise by Count A. de Gasparin,[94] which appeared about the\r\n    middle of the last century, may serve to show how close the\r\n    correspondence between the two processes, that of getting the table\r\n    to rap and that of causing Hans to respond, really is. The report of\r\n    this writer, based upon the detailed record of his tests in\r\n    table-moving and table-rapping, closely parallels in many minute\r\n    details the observations which were made in the course of our\r\n    experimentation with Hans. The case is all the more remarkable when\r\n    we bear in mind that this writer did not seek the cause of the\r\n    phenomena, as we did, in involuntary movements, but thrusting aside\r\n    this explanation, he posited the cause in the agency of some\r\n    mysterious fluid. It may not be amiss to say that this as well as\r\n    most other references were consulted after the present experiments\r\n    and introspections had been completed. Of the page references\r\n    preceding the following citations, the first always refers to the\r\n    page in the French original, and the other, enclosed in brackets, to\r\n    the parallel passage in the present monograph.\r\n\r\n    P. 49 [31]. Some questioners are especially suitable\r\n    (\"experimentateurs hors ligne\"), but in their absence, other persons\r\n    may also operate successfully (\"le succes, quoique moins brillant\r\n    alors, n'est pas impossible.\")\r\n\r\n    P. 25 [229]. But even the most suitable questioners do not always\r\n    succeed equally well (\"les plus surs d'eux-memes ne reussissaient\r\n    pas egalement tous les jours.\")\r\n\r\n    P. 42 [151]. When the questioner is in any way indisposed, the\r\n    measure of success is also less.\r\n\r\n    P. 91 & 87 [150]. The Questioner must first get into the sweep of\r\n    things (\"en train\"), and once he has done so, all interruption\r\n    whatsoever must be avoided.\r\n\r\n    P. 91 [93]. Unless there is sufficient tension on the part of the\r\n    questioner, the test will fail. (\"La volonte est-elle absente, rien\r\n    ne bouge.\")\r\n\r\n    P. 210 [93]. When there is too low a degree of tension, then too\r\n    great a number will be tapped (\"si votre volonte ne les [les tables]\r\n    arrete pas au moment ou se termine le chiffre pense, elles\r\n    continueront indefiniment.\")\r\n\r\n    P. 31 [93]. But too great concentration of attention will also\r\n    produce failure (\"s'il n'arrivait ... de desirer trop fortement le\r\n    succes et de m'impatienter en cas de retard, je n'avais plus aucune\r\n    action sur la table.\")\r\n\r\n    P. 36 [151]. If the proper mood (\"entrain habituel\") is wanting and\r\n    the tests are unsuccessful, it is best not to attempt some new and\r\n    difficult experiment, but to turn to some that are simpler and more\r\n    entertaining (\"La table obeissait mal; les coups etaient frappes\r\n    mollement et comme a regret.... Alors nous avons pris un parti dont\r\n    nous nous sommes bien trouves; nous avons persevere, et persevere\r\n    gaiement; ... nous avons ecarte la pensee des tentatives nouvelles,\r\n    et insiste sur les operations aisees et amusantes. Apres un certain\r\n    temps les dispositions etaient changees, la table bondissait et\r\n    attendait a peine nos commandements.\")\r\n\r\n    P. 199 [41, 90]. It is not necessary to enunciate the questions\r\n    aloud (\"On est convenu que celui qui commanderait ne prononcerait\r\n    pas a haute voix le nombre de coups, mais se contenterait de les\r\n    penser, apres les avoir communiques a l'oreille de son voisin. Eh\r\n    bien! la table a obei. Il n'y a jamais eu la moindre erreur.\")\r\n\r\n    P. 199 [64 ff.]. The large numbers are tapped more rapidly than the\r\n    small ones (\"la table a indique notre age tel qu'il etait dans notre\r\n    esprit, se hatant meme de la maniere la plus comique lorsque le\r\n    nombre des coups a frapper etait un peu considerable.\")\r\n\r\n    P. 210 [35 ff.]. Tests in which \"procedure was without knowledge\"\r\n    failed completely (\"Les tables ne revelent pas ce qui n'est pas dans\r\n    la pensee et dans la volonte de l'experimentateur; quand on veut les\r\n    charger d'autre chose que d'obeir comme des membres, on arrive a des\r\n    erreurs continuelles.\")\r\n\r\n    P. 28, 29, 217 [72]. When of two experimenters each tries to get the\r\n    horse to tap a different number, then that one who is the better\r\n    able to compel the animal's attention, will be the successful one.\r\n    (\"L'un veut faire prevaloire un chiffre pense plus considerable,\r\n    l'autre un chiffre pense moins considerable.... Eh bien: l'operateur\r\n    le plus puissant l'emporte.\" \"Ainsi A est charge secretement de\r\n    faire frapper 25 coups, B est charge secretement de l'arreter a 18;\r\n    A l'emporte, et les 25 coups s'achevent.... On fait maintenant\r\n    l'inverse: B est charge secretement de faire frapper 13 coups; A est\r\n    charge secretement de l'arreter a 7; A l'emporte encore et le\r\n    chiffre 7 ne peut etre depasse.\")]\r\n\r\nThe experience of a number of practical men, who have had much to do\r\nwith horses and yet achieved but very modest success with Hans, goes to\r\nshow that it is not always the lack of sufficient authoritativeness,\r\nmentioned under heading 1 that is the sole cause of failure, as has been\r\nclaimed so often. That the horse was, to a certain degree, influenced by\r\nthis element of authority is shown, however, by the following incident.\r\nA certain gentleman, when alone in the courtyard with Hans, received\r\nresponses only so long as I (concealed in the barn) kept the barn-door\r\nopen just a little, so that my presence could be known to the horse. As\r\nsoon as I closed the door, Hans refused to respond to the gentleman.\r\nThose who possessed sufficient power of concentration and the requisite\r\nmotor tendency--the two characteristics mentioned under 1 and 2\r\nabove,--were able to obtain responses from the horse without any\r\nprevious practice. Practice merely effected a more economic distribution\r\nof attention, so that the larger numbers especially were more successful\r\nas a result (pages 68 and 89). Those who were lacking in either of the\r\ncharacteristics mentioned under 2 and 3 would not be aided even by the\r\ngreatest amount of practice, as is shown by the case mentioned in\r\nSupplement III (page 255).--That many individuals were at first\r\nsuccessful but were later unable to get any successful responses, is to\r\nbe accounted for by the fact that the power of concentration, at first\r\npresent, later rapidly disappeared. This temporary increase in the power\r\nof doing mental work was first investigated experimentally by Rivers and\r\nKraepelin,[95] and was called by them \"Antrieb\" and aptly likened to the\r\nfirst pull of a team of horses in starting off. This, too, explains an\r\nexperience which befell a number of the horse's visitors, who later\r\ndescribed it to me. Wishing to utilize a momentary absence of Mr. von\r\nOsten, they excitedly put a hasty question to Hans, and with amazing\r\nregularity received correct responses.--Besides Mr. von Osten, Mr.\r\nSchillings and myself, not many were always able to induce Hans to bring\r\nthe colored cloths or to execute the head movements. It was easy, on the\r\nother hand, to get him to nod. Therefore there was some truth in Mr. von\r\nOsten's assertion, that Hans would be unable to answer a difficult\r\nquestion if he had not previously indicated by means of a nod that he\r\nhad grasped its import. Those who were not concentrating sufficiently,\r\nwould not look into Hans's face, when he was expected to nod, and would\r\nnot bend over, when Hans ought to begin tapping--such persons could not,\r\ntherefore, since they did not induce Hans to nod, elicit the tapping. I,\r\nmyself saw the \"no\" successfully elicited only in the case of Mr. von\r\nOsten, Mr. Schillings and Mr. Hahn; the \"right\" and \"left\" only in the\r\ncase of the former two. It must remain uncertain whether this failure on\r\nthe part of otherwise suitable persons to elicit the responses for\r\n\"right\" and \"left\" was due to their accompanying these ideas by\r\nmovements of the eyes instead of by movements of the head, (page 106).\r\nFor unfortunately it was not possible to make special tests to discover\r\nwhether Hans reacted to isolated eye movements. There is, however, more\r\nthan one reason why I would doubt this. Taken all in all, there were but\r\nfew persons who were entirely representative of the type described (c.\r\nf. page 31)--they were those who are commonly characterized as being of\r\na lively temperament and strongly impulsive. Thus Hans acquired a\r\nreputation for \"Einkennigkeit\", that is, he would accustom himself only\r\nto certain persons. Such a reputation was hard to reconcile with his\r\nmuch praised intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn closing, just a word on the influence of the public that was present.\r\nAs was shown on page 69, the public in general did not influence the\r\nhorse in his reactions. The effect upon the questioner, however, was\r\nunmistakable, and worked in a twofold manner. On the one hand the\r\nquestioner's zeal was increased and with it the tension of\r\nconcentration. On the other hand, it introduced an element of diversion,\r\nand attention was divided between the horse and the spectators, and thus\r\nconcentration suffered. If the disturbing effect was slight, as in the\r\ncase of Mr. von Osten, then the favorable influence exercised by the\r\npresence of the public outweighed the unfavorable. Mr. von Osten was,\r\nfor that reason, often particularly successful when working in the\r\npresence of a large body of spectators. This was noted by many and was\r\nascribed to the ambition of the horse. When, however, a person was\r\neasily diverted, as was Mr. Schillings, then the presence of the public\r\nhad a less fortunate effect.\r\n\r\nThis, then, completes my explanation of the facts gleaned from\r\nobservation and experimentation. It accomplishes all, I hope, that may\r\nbe expected of an explanation. All the known achievements of the horse,\r\nall the successes and failures of the questioner, have been reduced to a\r\nsingle principle; no secondary hypothesis has been invoked, and but\r\nslight place has been given to the element of chance. Nevertheless, it\r\nmay not be out of place to forestall two objections which might possibly\r\nbe raised. First, some may assert that it was through our\r\nexperimentation that the horse became mechanized and incapacitated as\r\nregards conceptual thinking; that formerly he really could solve\r\narithmetical problems, and only later developed the very bad habit of\r\ndepending upon the signs which I gave him. This objection is to be\r\nrefuted in that I did not originate these signs, but first noted them in\r\nMr. von Osten, himself, and in that Hans still works as faithfully as\r\never for Mr. von Osten. I have learned from many trustworthy witnesses\r\nthat the horse still continues to give brilliant exhibitions of his\r\n\"ability\". If, on the other hand, anyone should assert that it was only\r\nwith us that Hans reacted to movements, but that with his master he\r\nreally thought and still thinks, then I must ask for proof. This latter\r\nargument is by no means very original. When Faraday in 1853 proved\r\nexperimentally that \"table-rapping\" is the result of involuntary\r\nmovements on the part of the participants standing about the table, the\r\nspiritualists asserted that his experiments had nothing in common with\r\ntheir own proceedings, because his subjects (who by the way, had been up\r\nto that time firm believers in table-rapping) probably did move the\r\ntable, they said, while they (the spiritualists) do no such thing.[96]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nGENESIS OF THE REACTION OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding discussion we have regarded the achievements of the\r\nhorse as well as Mr. von Osten's explanation of them, as matters of\r\nfact. Let us now consider the question: How did the horse come by these\r\nachievements, and how did its master arrive at his curious theory in\r\nexplanation of them? Did he indeed seek to instill in the horse's mind\r\nthe rudiments of human culture through long years of painstaking\r\ninstruction in accordance with the method described in Supplement I\r\n(page 245)? If that is the case, then, of course his hoped-for success\r\nwas only seeming, not real. Or did he, as so many critics aver,\r\nsystematically train the horse to respond automatically to certain cues,\r\nand propound his theory merely for the purpose of misleading the public?\r\nThere might possibly be another alternative, viz.: was there a mixture\r\nof instruction and of training to respond to cues?\r\n\r\nThe production of the horse's achievements would not require a great\r\ndeal of explanation, if it were a case of mere training for the purpose\r\nof establishing certain responses to certain cues. It might be\r\ndesirable, however, before deciding in favor of one of these\r\npossibilities, to indicate briefly the process of development, as it\r\nmight occur, if the point of view is taken that _bona fide_ instruction\r\nwas given.\r\n\r\nThis development would probably be as follows:--Mr. von Osten, as the\r\nresult of theoretical speculation or of a misinterpretation of the facts\r\nof experience, having arrived at the conclusion that the horse possessed\r\nextraordinary capacity, finally undertook to instruct a certain horse\r\nfor a period covering three years. This one having died, he, nothing\r\ndaunted, undertook the education of another one. What it was that\r\ninfluenced this old teacher of mathematics to deprive humankind of the\r\nbenefit of his extraordinary pedagogical ability and love of teaching,\r\nwe do not know. It may be that he had had bitter experience in that\r\nline, or again, mayhap the newness and tremendousness of this other task\r\nstimulated him. His first problem must have been to arouse the interest\r\nof the animal in this process of education. It was hardly to be believed\r\nthat Hans would eagerly cooeperate in a process which promised to yield\r\nhim no immediate benefit. The teacher sought to overcome this lack of\r\nimmediate interest by the means of rewards. To Hans the sweet carrot was\r\nas toothsome a bite as candy is to the child. And since the horse was\r\nfurthermore kept on low rations on account of the relatively low amount\r\nof physical exercise he took, the anticipation of the carrots was doubly\r\nenticing.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that Mr. von Osten sought to teach the horse, according\r\nto his own statement, was the significance of the names of colors and of\r\nthe spatial directions such as \"up\", \"down\", etc. In the case of\r\nchildren there is a simple test by means of which we may discover if\r\nthey have put any content into these words. The test is: Do they,\r\nthemselves, use them correctly? Do they call the blue, blue, and the\r\nred, red? Since the horse could not speak, his instructor had to give\r\nhim some means by which he could make himself understood. He taught\r\nHans to approach the colors and select the cloth of the color wanted. He\r\nalso taught him to make those movements of the head or body which\r\ncorrespond with the expressions: \"up\", \"down\", etc.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Hans had to be taught to bring the cloths. Then began the\r\npointing out of the different colors, accompanied each time by their\r\nproper names. It is very probable that at first Hans had to be led each\r\ntime to each separate colored cloth and taught to raise it or to touch\r\nit with his nose. Later, Mr. von Osten, after having pronounced the name\r\nof the color, remained at his place, with his head and body directed to\r\nthe cloth in question and gazing intently at it, in order to see whether\r\nor not the horse was pointing out the right one. Naturally Hans would,\r\nat first, fail a hundred times where he would succeed but once, but\r\nsince the horse would receive the anticipated reward in case of success,\r\nhe gradually became conscious that this reward was attached to\r\nexecutions which had some special mark. This special mark would be\r\nexpressed in human speech by the statement that the horse would go in\r\nthe direction indicated by the position of the instructor's body. For\r\nHans, of course, this would not take the form of an abstract statement,\r\nbut simply of a definite way of seeing and of going and a correlation of\r\nthe two in a certain definite manner,--the whole being a process, the\r\nelements of which remained unanalyzed and unaccounted for by Hans. Owing\r\nto the position of the eye, it was possible for him to keep his master\r\nwithin his field of vision, while he was approaching the cloths. And\r\nonly when he had correlated his approach in a certain definite manner\r\nwith his visual perception of the master, i. e., only when he had felt\r\nhis way, as it were, along the latter's line of vision, did he receive\r\nhis reward. A sufficient number of repetitions was all that was\r\nnecessary to establish an association in the psychological sense of the\r\nterm. In the same manner, dogs will learn, as was indicated on page 177,\r\nto bring an object upon which the master has fixed his gaze, it\r\nmattering little whether or not the name of the object be enunciated.\r\nThere is only this difference, that, in the case of the dog it is not\r\npossible to keep the image of the master within the field of vision; but\r\nneither is it necessary, for he has recognized the object before he has\r\nstarted for it. We must remember, however, that it does not simplify an\r\nattempt at explanation to assume that Mr. von Osten consciously trained\r\nthe animal to respond to certain bodily positions of the questioner.\r\nFor, even in this case, it would be necessary to explain how it was\r\npossible for him to train the horse to heed the cues.--In the course of\r\ntime, the instructor may have noticed that whenever he moved during the\r\ncourse of a test the horse invariably failed. But he may have regarded\r\nthis merely as an incidental distraction and afterward was careful to\r\nremain quiet. As soon as he increased the number of cloths upon the\r\nfloor, it was no longer possible for him to give the horse such accurate\r\ndirective signs, and the number of errors consequently increased.\r\nAscribing them to the inattentiveness of his pupil, he sought to\r\nencourage him by such calls as \"look out\", \"look there\", \"see there\",\r\nbelieving that, thus, he was directing the horse's attention to the\r\ndesired color. Without understanding the meaning of the calls, Hans\r\nlearned, however, to keep moving just as long as the calling continued,\r\nfor if he did this he was regularly rewarded. An association was\r\nestablished between the call and the impulse to move on. And with these\r\ntwo associations established, Hans gave the impression of having grasped\r\nthe meaning of the color terms.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the proper movements in response to the terms \"up\" and\r\n\"down\" may be explained by the fact that the movements themselves were\r\npractised in a purely external fashion. Thus, whenever the word \"left\"\r\nwas pronounced, the horse's head was pulled to the left by means of the\r\nbridle or the reward was held off to that side. Later, Mr. von Osten,\r\nwho looked expectantly at the horse's head, whenever he pronounced the\r\nword would unconsciously move his own head in the direction in which he\r\ndesired the horse to turn. This is quite in accord with the words of\r\nDarwin to the effect that whenever we wish an object to move in a\r\ncertain direction it is well-nigh impossible for us to inhibit an\r\nunconscious, involuntary movement in that direction. Proof for this may\r\nbe found on all sides, in daily experience.[97] Imagine, for instance,\r\nthe strain sensations of the bowler or billiard player as he follows the\r\nmoving ball. It is impossible to decide whether Mr. von Osten,\r\nconsciously continued to image the head movements which he expected the\r\nhorse to make or whether these anticipatory images later remained below\r\nthe threshold as was always the case with Mr. Schillings and myself (see\r\npage 100). But this question is of little significance, for even\r\nassuming that he always thought of the movement he expected on the part\r\nof the horse, this by no means implies that he was conscious of the\r\nmovements on his part, which were associated with the thought process.\r\n\r\nEverything up to this point might be explained as the working of simple\r\nmemory association, but when we come to problems in counting and\r\narithmetical calculation, we are in the field of conceptual thought.\r\nHere, again, it was necessary for Mr. von Osten to invent a suitable\r\nmeans of expression for the horse, and once more this had to be borrowed\r\nfrom the treasury of gesture-language. Tapping with the hoof was\r\nnaturally hit upon as one of the normal, expressive movements of the\r\nhorse. This has long been used by trainers, in preparing horses for show\r\npurposes. The method used in training the horse to make this response is\r\nof no import, whether it was by touching his foot with the hand, or\r\ntapping his leg, or by any other means.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that many will declare, as being nonsensical, any attempt\r\nto introduce number-concepts[AJ] into an animal's mind, because the\r\nnecessary motor basis is lacking. We will not, just at this point, stop\r\nto discuss whether or not it was not possible to develop number-concepts\r\nfrom purely auditory or visual representations. It is evident, however,\r\nthat Mr. von Osten believed that a motor basis of some sort was\r\nessential. In the case of man this basis is found in the enunciation of\r\nthe number names (or in the manipulation of the fingers). Mr. von Osten\r\nseemed to think that he was justified in assuming that, even in the case\r\nof the horse, some form of inner articulation of the word-sounds was\r\npossible;--at the same time, in so doing, he did not blink at the\r\npsychological difficulty of this hypothesis. The tapping of the foot was\r\nto be regarded merely as the expression of the process of inner\r\ncounting, but not as the motor basis of the process. For this latter\r\npurpose tapping would be quite inadequate, for the number complexes\r\nwhich arise in the summation process of counting, could not be\r\ndifferentiated by mere tapping with the foot, any more than a child\r\ncould learn to count by employing only one finger. Mr. von Osten\r\nevidently imagined the process was somewhat like this: Whenever Hans was\r\nabout to count 5, he would enunciate inwardly the numbers from 1 to 5,\r\nand would accompany each word with a tap of the foot. Since,\r\nfurthermore, wooden pins and balls could be used--as in the case of\r\nchildren--for giving visual content in learning the significance of the\r\nnumber-terms, it seemed as if all the conditions necessary for the\r\nformation of number-concepts were supplied. However, the most essential\r\nthing had to be presupposed, viz.: that the horse virtually possessed\r\nthe general power of forming concepts,[AK] and that all that had been\r\nlacking was the suitable conditions for its development. Mr. von Osten\r\nheld tenaciously to this conviction, and it was this conviction that was\r\nthe basis for the infinite patience with which the tests had been\r\npursued.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AJ: The author intends to take up the problem of counting,\r\n    so-called, on the part of animals and of the principle involved, in\r\n    another work soon to be forthcoming.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AK: There are some who believe they are warranted in\r\n    concluding the opposite from the structure of the animal's brain\r\n    alone. We may say that the brain of the horse, compared with that of\r\n    the ape, or even that of the dog, represents a relatively low type\r\n    of development. But owing to the rapid changes in the views, often\r\n    contradictory, concerning the nature of the nervous structures and\r\n    processes underlying the thought process, any conclusion based on\r\n    such views would be premature. For this reason we cannot agree with\r\n    the French physiologist who was dissecting the brain of a horse and,\r\n    struck by its smallness of size, exclaimed: \"When I saw your proud\r\n    look and beautiful neck, I hesitated a moment before mounting upon\r\n    your back. But now that I have seen how small is your brain, I no\r\n    longer have any qualm about using you.\"[98]]\r\n\r\nTo come now to the learning process itself;--we may assume that, at\r\nfirst, whenever the horse began to tap in response to commands, he would\r\nreceive a reward for this purely mechanical feat. Wooden pins were then\r\nplanted on the ground and designated as: one, one two, etc., and each\r\ntime someone would raise the horse's foot as many times as the count\r\ndemanded (see Supplement I). Then Mr. von Osten would take his stand at\r\nthe horse's side and would command him, let us say, to tap 3. Hans\r\nnoting merely (from his master's position) that he was expected to tap,\r\nwould begin. The instructor, who had bent forward in order to watch the\r\nhorse tapping,[AL] would involuntarily straighten up again at the third\r\ntap, without being conscious of it and quite unaware that he was thus\r\ngiving a signal. The horse would be startled, and sometimes he would\r\nimmediately cease tapping and sometimes not. But it was only in the\r\nfirst case that he would receive a reward. Thus, unknown to the\r\ninstructor, an association became established between the sight of the\r\nupward jerk of the instructor and the act of ceasing to tap. To be sure,\r\nthe animal would receive sundry visual impressions from the wooden pins\r\nset up before him and the auditory stimulations of the spoken number\r\nnames, on the basis of which, the concepts were to be formed in his\r\nmind. But in this chaos of visual impressions (at times there were two\r\nwooden pins, then three, then four, sometimes there were the pins, at\r\nothers, the balls of the counting-machine)--and in the babel of\r\nword-sounds--which evidently meant nothing but noise to him--amidst all\r\nthis there was but one constant element: the final movement of the\r\ninstructor's body. The moment the horse reacted to this, he would\r\nreceive the tidbit at the hands of his overjoyed master, and thus he\r\nbecame more and more accustomed to attend to this jerk, even after it\r\nhad gradually decreased in scope. And the reason again, why this jerk\r\ntended to become less pronounced was that the tests were gradually\r\nbecoming more and more successful. For, corresponding to the degree in\r\nwhich the horse began to react properly, the instructor's tenseness and\r\nexcitement tended to decrease, and with this decrease of the emotional\r\nelement in the man's consciousness, the accompanying non-voluntary,\r\nexpressive movement gradually became less pronounced until it attained\r\nthat extraordinary refinement which it possesses to-day. We noticed\r\nalso, that whenever the horse, for any reason, had to be trained anew,\r\nMr. von Osten's movements would, on the whole, become somewhat more\r\ngross, as for instance after the tests with the blinders. There is not a\r\nshadow of a doubt that this increase in the movement's extent was\r\nentirely unintentional, since the horse could not see his master at all\r\non account of the blinders which had been attached to the trappings.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AL: This natural and close connection between the process\r\n    of attention and the movement toward the object attended to is\r\n    clearly expressed in our English and French terms, derived from the\r\n    Latin \"tendere ad--,\" to reach toward--.]\r\n\r\nIn the same way it is possible to explain the details. Mr. von Osten\r\nhimself said that at first Hans had tapped at times with his left foot,\r\nat times with his right, just as he pleased. But later his master taught\r\nhim to tap only with the right. Whenever he began with the left, Mr. von\r\nOsten would immediately interrupt him, and he was allowed to add only a\r\nfinal tap with his left foot. Thus, this additional tap which was\r\nsometimes made with the left foot was but the vestige of an earlier\r\nrudimentary habit. The signal for it was the stooping posture in which\r\nthe master remained after the head-jerk had been made. Whenever Mr. von\r\nOsten had given Hans a small number to tap, he would bend forward only a\r\nlittle. But when he expected a larger number he would bend forward\r\nsomewhat more, owing to the desire to observe the tapping more\r\ncarefully. From the slight inclination of the master's body the horse\r\nwould get the cue that he was expected to tap for a short time only, by\r\nthe greater degree of inclination he would know that he was to tap for a\r\nlonger period. In the second case he tapped rapidly and did not raise\r\nhis foot as high from the ground--evincing a regard for the saving of\r\nenergy, which may well be attributed to a horse. And thus arose the\r\nconnection between the degree of inclination of the instructor's body\r\nand the horse's rate of tapping.\r\n\r\nSo, now that the ability to count and solve problems had become\r\nfixed--as the old gentleman thought--he began to instruct the horse in\r\nother branches. Since everything had been translated into terms which\r\nwere to be expressed by means of tapping with the foot, and thus really\r\nput into terms of number--which was perhaps natural for an old teacher\r\nof mathematics--the same mechanism was involved in these accomplishments\r\nas in those of counting, etc. Mr. von Osten saw the animal's\r\nintelligence steadily increase, without having the slightest notion that\r\nbetween his words and the responsive movements of the horse, there were\r\ninterpolated his own unconscious movements--and that thus instead of the\r\nmuch desired intellectual feats on the part of the horse, there was\r\nmerely a motor reaction to a purely sensory stimulus. It has been a\r\ncommon custom of man to posit some extraneous cause for movements\r\nresulting from certain involuntary motions of his own, of which he is\r\nnot aware, (witness the divining-rod).[AM] And furthermore, when these\r\nresults appear to be rational, the tendency is to seek their cause in\r\nsome extraneous intelligence, not his own. Just as the spiritualists\r\nascribe the \"messages\" which are revealed to them through table-rapping,\r\nto certain rational spirits, so Mr. von Osten credited the intelligence\r\nof the horse with the result produced by his own involuntary signs--i.\r\ne., with the proper solution of problems.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AM: G. Franzius,[99] privy counselor of the admiralty,\r\n    master of the dry-dock at Kiel, is responsible for the undeserved\r\n    revival of the ancient belief, long buried by science, that the\r\n    divining branch is put into motion solely as the result of the\r\n    influence of hidden springs or treasures, and without any agency in\r\n    the person who is holding it. The untenability of this theory comes\r\n    home to us most forcibly when we recall how various are the kinds of\r\n    things which have been discovered by means of the branch. First\r\n    there is gold and water, which are the only ones mentioned by Mr.\r\n    Franzius. The water can be thus discovered only when it flows below\r\n    ground, say that which is passing through the mains of a city,\r\n    whereas the water of the Rhine or the Elbe would have no effect on\r\n    the branch. Besides gold, every other kind of metal has been\r\n    supposedly located by the branch,--as well as coal, gypsum, ochre,\r\n    red-chalk sulphur and petroleum,--according to the desire of the one\r\n    searching. Thus, the very same branch that just a moment ago was\r\n    influenced by the least bit of underground water, may remain\r\n    unaffected by the presence of a large body of water, if in the\r\n    meantime I have changed my plan and decide to search for coal or for\r\n    gold. But that is not all. The branch will point out a murderer or\r\n    the place where a murder has been committed, it will discover the\r\n    thief or his trail, as well as the things stolen or merely touched\r\n    by him. It will indicate where the boundary-stone that has been\r\n    moved, ought to stand. The branch further discloses the sins of the\r\n    persons concerning whom it is consulted, as well as their talents\r\n    and abilities, the journeys they have made and the wounds they have\r\n    received. It will indicate whether or not a person has money and how\r\n    much. It can announce what absent persons are doing and what apparel\r\n    they are wearing, and of what color it is. It will give information\r\n    on theological, medical, zoological, and botanical questions. In\r\n    fine, no matter what the question, it will never fail of an\r\n    answer.[100, 101]\r\n\r\n    The impossibility of explaining the phenomena in a purely physical\r\n    way was recognized at a very early date. For a long time the\r\n    activity of the users of the divining rod seems to have been\r\n    restricted to the search for metals. The first (or one of the first)\r\n    to raise his voice against it was the learned G. Agricola[102]\r\n    (1556), and after him there were many who all wrote more or less\r\n    independently of one another. Aside from swindle and chance, it was\r\n    usually believed that sorcery of the agency of Beelzebub was\r\n    involved, and for that reason the Church has repeatedly forbidden\r\n    the use of the divining-rod. But even in the 17th century we find\r\n    some who believed that it was imagination alone that moved the\r\n    person's hand, and with it the rod,[103, 104] (\"fortassis etiam\r\n    phantasia manum in motum concitante\"); and that points out the\r\n    essentials of the solution of the phenomenon, and we will not go\r\n    into the matter here in detail. A number of complex psychological\r\n    problems arising in connection with it are still waiting to be\r\n    solved, but this much appears certain; the staff or branch plays no\r\n    other part in the whole process than that which is served by the\r\n    three levers in the tests described in Chapter IV (pages 116\r\n    ff.),--they simply magnify the expressive movements of the diviner.\r\n    And so we can understand why the instruments serving as rod might be\r\n    so varied. Hay-forks, pickets, clock-springs and pendulums, scissors\r\n    and pliers have been used. A knife and fork or two pipes, fastened\r\n    together, an open book, and even a sausage, grasped at both ends and\r\n    thus bent together somewhat,--all have served the purpose equally\r\n    well. We can understand, too, how some adepts are able to achieve\r\n    the same degree of success--for they do succeed beyond a\r\n    doubt--without any rod whatever, but simply by placing the index\r\n    fingers end to end and bending them somewhat, and even by merely\r\n    groping about with hands outstretched or folded before them.[106]]\r\n\r\nTwo other phenomena may have tended to strengthen Mr. von Osten's belief\r\nin Hans's intelligence. One was the misleading similarity with which the\r\nhorse's supposed errors in computation and the poorly adjusted\r\nconcentration of the questioner, were expressed. We recall the\r\ndifficulty in the case of very high numbers. This might easily be\r\nconsidered as being due to the horse's ability to work more readily with\r\nsmall, rather than with large numbers, whereas, as a matter of fact, it\r\nwas due solely to the difficulty of the questioner to keep his attention\r\nconcentrated upon the number for so long a time. We recall also the\r\nfrequency of errors of one unit too few and one unit too many. These\r\nwere easily interpreted as miscounts on the part of Hans, but in truth\r\nwere the result of the poorly concentrated attention of the questioner.\r\nAdded to this was the seeming independence and self-sufficiency of the\r\nhorse. Often the number given by him was other than that desired by his\r\nmaster. Usually Hans was in the wrong in such cases, but sometimes, too,\r\nhe was right. At any rate, this served to give the impression of\r\nindependence of thought which his master so thoroughly believed he\r\npossessed, and which was the goal of his endeavors--though as a matter\r\nof fact he was farther removed than ever from that goal.\r\n\r\nSome may ask: Does not this whole process partake of the essentials of\r\nall training, (though cumbersome and misunderstood, to be sure), and is\r\nthere any need of investigating whether or not the actual development\r\nwas of the sort here outlined, or whether it actually took the course\r\ncommon to all training?\r\n\r\nIn order to answer this question we must determine more specifically\r\nwhat we mean by the term \"training\". Usually we take it to mean the\r\nestablishment in the animal, of definite habits of motor reaction in\r\nresponse to certain stimuli purposely selected by the trainer, and\r\nwithout involving any process of animal consciousness other than\r\nassociation. Such a conception may be applied also to man, if we assume\r\nthat the higher thought processes can be eliminated. If that were the\r\ncase, the above definition would not have to be changed, not even with\r\nregard to the word \"animal\", for we must take it in the antique sense of\r\n\"zoon\", a signification readopted by modern zoology. The concept may be\r\nwidened, however, by omitting the differentia of \"purpose\", or even\r\nmore, by including the habitual association of ideas or images (instead\r\nof movements) with certain sensory stimuli. But in so doing, we must\r\nbear in mind that we are going beyond the usual content which in\r\neveryday practice is put into the term \"training\". Especially, when we\r\ncease to regard the presence of purpose in the trainer's mind (both in\r\ngiving the stimulus as well as in the habituation of the animal to them)\r\nas essential. When this is done, the conception of training really\r\nresolves itself into the much wider conception of habit-building, and\r\nthe whole discussion becomes merely a quarrel over words. In order to\r\nobviate this, let us bear in mind that in the following, the word\r\n\"training\" is always taken in the usual and narrower sense. The term\r\nthen is still ambiguous only in so far as it has not merely its original\r\nsignificance of the _act_ of purposely habituating (a person or an\r\nanimal) to perform certain definite movements, but by transference is\r\nalso used to denote the _effect_, i. e., the occurrence of the movements\r\nin question. But this does not really detract from the clearness of the\r\nconcept itself.\r\n\r\nHaving cleared up the question of definition, let us return to our\r\noriginal problem: Does the hypothetical account of the probable\r\ndevelopment of the horse's reactions, which is given on pages 213 to\r\n220, represent a case of training? This must be denied decidedly with\r\nregard to the tapping of numbers and the solution of arithmetical\r\nproblems. For here the sensory stimuli which were purposely given, i.\r\ne., the wooden pins, the balls, and the spoken words, were intended to\r\nsubserve the function of arousing not movement, but thought processes in\r\nthe horse; whereas the function of the horse's movements was to give\r\nexpression to these thought processes. Of the really effective\r\nstimuli--the slight movements on his part--the master was never\r\nconscious, much less were they purposely made. The same holds true for\r\nthe \"up\" and \"down\", \"yes\" and \"no\", etc., for here also Mr. von Osten\r\ncounted upon the rise of the corresponding concepts, and not merely upon\r\na purely external, mechanical association of meaningless sounds with\r\ncertain movement-responses on the part of the horse. This might also\r\nexplain the genesis of Mr. von Osten's belief that Hans was able\r\nmentally to put himself in the place of the questioner, (page 19). At\r\nany rate it is very improbable that he, Mr. von Osten himself, clearly\r\ndistinguished between the concept: \"up\" and the sound of the word \"up\".\r\nWhen we come to consider the horse's selection of the colored cloths,\r\nand even more his leaping and rearing, we find that the distinction\r\nbetween \"training\" and \"instruction\" vanishes. If we had to deal only\r\nwith this class of achievements, we might perhaps say, without fear of\r\ngoing very far wrong, that the only difference between this and the\r\nordinary form of training was that Mr. von Osten had intended to train\r\nthe horse to respond to auditory signs (words), but had unintentionally\r\ntrained him to respond to visual signs instead. But it is not this type\r\nof performance that has become the bone of contention. Just as it would\r\nbe misleading to maintain that Mr. von Osten's effort was nothing other\r\nthan a case of training, so it also would be unjustifiable to designate\r\nthe results of his effort by that name, since the really effective\r\nstimuli were not, as has been pointed out just now, given intentionally.\r\n\r\nAs far as the horse is concerned, it is a matter of indifference whether\r\nor not really effective stimuli were given intentionally by the\r\nquestioner. The animal knows nothing of human purposes and if he were\r\ntransferred to a circus, he would find nothing new in the method\r\nemployed there, except the use of the whip. We, however, define our\r\nconcepts from the human and not from the horse's point of view. We may\r\ndefinitely say, therefore, that the method described cannot be regarded\r\nas that of training, neither in its application nor in the effect\r\nproduced, though in the latter it closely simulates the effects of the\r\ntraining method.\r\n\r\nHaving thus differentiated between the methods of instruction and\r\ntraining, let us now attempt to decide on the basis of such indications\r\nas we may possess, which of the two was actually represented by the\r\ndevelopment of the horse's attainments. Surveying the facts which we\r\nhave at hand, we may say that there are hosts of reasons why we cannot\r\nassume that it was a case of training. Everything that we know from our\r\nown observation and from the well-attested statements of others, with\r\nregard to the actual process of instruction, weighs against the\r\nassumption. Another evidence of this is the long period of time which\r\nMr. von Osten required (both in the case of Hans, as well as with his\r\npredecessor), whereas the same end would have been much more speedily\r\nattained if it had been a case of training. A further argument is the\r\nfact that a large horse was selected for the purpose, whereas a small\r\nmare would have been far more suitable, (c. f., \"Clever Rosa\", page 7).\r\nAgain, the whip, that sorcerer's rod of all professional trainers, was\r\nhere absent. And finally, many traits of character of Mr. von Osten, as\r\nwell as his conduct during the whole course of events, militate against\r\nsuch an assumption. He generously turned the horse over to us, as he had\r\ngiven it over to Count zu Castell, Count Matuschka and Mr. Schillings.\r\nHe eagerly besought a scientific investigation. He had made several\r\nreports to different ministries. All of these acts could only hasten the\r\ndenouement. What could have been his motive? Some thought they detected\r\nan effort at pecuniary speculation, and an advertisement of June, 1902,\r\nin the \"Militaerwochenblatt\", in which Hans was offered for sale, seemed\r\nto confirm the conjecture. Mr. von Osten says that this occurred at a\r\ntime when he himself was sick and had become tired of the job. And why\r\nshould he not be willing to sell even a thinking horse, since he had\r\nbecome convinced that any other could be instructed in the same way?\r\nBesides, I have it on good authority that after the publication of the\r\nSeptember report he received several exorbitant offers; to mention only\r\none of them: a local vaudeville company was ready to pay him 30,000 to\r\n60,000 marks per month. He refused every one of these offers. Some may\r\nsay that perhaps he wanted still more. But if he knew that the day of\r\njudgment was close at hand, he also knew that before then, if ever, was\r\nthe sunshiny day on which to make his hay. A more auspicious time he\r\ncould never hope to see again.--Let us add, once more, that he never\r\ncharged admission to any of Hans's performances, although there were\r\nmany who were anxious to see the horse, and many enthusiasts had come\r\nfrom a great distance. And finally, he was an old man, unmarried and\r\nentirely alone, a property owner, but a man whose wants were few and\r\nvery simple--and his Hans was almost his sole companion. Is it possible\r\nthat such a man, one who had all the pride of gentle birth, would become\r\na trickster in his old age, all for the love of money?\r\n\r\nThe unreliability of Mr. von Osten's signs is good proof of their\r\ninvoluntary nature. Anyone who had seen him work with the horse could\r\nnot have helped noticing that he certainly did not have complete control\r\nover the animal, and was not able, at a given moment, to make Hans\r\nperform a certain feat, as would have been the case if the process had\r\nbeen one of \"training\". Again and again Hans failed to make the right\r\ncount. Before a large audience, one time, it took four tests to get him\r\nto tap properly up to 20, and in all four I could note clearly that it\r\nwas Mr. von Osten who, by his involuntary premature movements, was the\r\ninnocent cause of the failure. On another occasion, after Hans had done\r\nsome beautiful work in fractions, in the presence of a large number of\r\nspectators, the master asked him the simple question: \"Where is the\r\nnumerator in a fraction?\"--The answer was first: \"to the left\", and\r\nthen, after a severe reprimand: \"down\" (below), and finally: \"up\"\r\n(above). He often made just such incorrect movements of the head. In the\r\ncolor-selecting tests the average of error was quite unpredictable. With\r\nan equal number of tests, on one day, half would be successful, on\r\nanother, four fifths, on a third, one-tenth. Often Hans appeared to be\r\n\"indisposed\" for days at a time. The color tests would often end in\r\nexpressions of rage on the part of Mr. von Osten and in consequence Hans\r\nwould become startled and would then storm about the courtyard so that\r\nit was dangerous to try to approach him. Some may object that all this\r\nwas mere comedy and that possibly Mr. von Osten prevented some of the\r\ntests from turning out successfully. But this objection is to be met by\r\nthe statement that very often failure would occur just when it was\r\nparticularly desirable to have the tests appear in a favorable light\r\nbefore a large and enthusiastic assemblage of visitors. After such\r\nfailures he would be downcast on account of Hans's contrariness. It is\r\nalso significant that Mr. von Osten's percentage of error, corresponds\r\nvery closely with my percentage of error in the \"non-voluntary\" tests,\r\n(page 84f.), whereas he never was able to obtain the errorless results\r\nwhich I obtained in my \"voluntary\" experiments.\r\n\r\nBut we must be careful not to confuse non-voluntary movement and lack of\r\nknowledge of the movement. And again we must distinguish between\r\nknowledge of the grosser and the finer signals. Mr. von Osten was aware\r\nof the grosser movements, and talked quite freely concerning them, but\r\nin so doing, showed that he was quite unaware of their true function. He\r\nundertook to show us what we already knew--that, when he remained\r\nstanding perfectly erect, he could elicit no sort of response from Hans.\r\nFurthermore, that whenever he continued to bend forward, Hans would\r\nalways respond incorrectly and with very high numbers. He knew, also,\r\nthat Hans was distracted in his operations every time the questioner\r\nresumed the erect posture while the tapping was in progress. This he\r\ndemonstrated to us on one occasion in the following manner. He said to\r\nHans: \"You are to count to 7; I will stand erect at 5\". He repeated the\r\ntest five times, and each time Hans stopped tapping when the master\r\nraised his body. Several such tests resulted in the same way. Mr. von\r\nOsten, however, believed this to be a caprice of the horse and at first\r\ndeclared that he would yet be able to eliminate it, but later became\r\nresigned to it as an irremediable evil. Mr. von Osten was also aware\r\nthat the questioner ought not move while the horse was approaching a\r\ncolored cloth, and cautioned me in regard to it, though I had already\r\nnoted as much. And finally, he also knew what influence his calls had\r\nwhile the horse was selecting the cloth, and he told me that it was of\r\ngreat assistance to Hans to be admonished frequently, since thus his\r\nattention was brought to bear upon the proper cloth. Yet, when we\r\nrequested Mr. von Osten to desist calling, since he was thereby\r\ninfluencing the horse in the choice of the cloth, he answered: \"Why\r\nthat's just what I wish to do!\"--But though the statement that he was\r\naware of the nature of these grosser signs is thus seen to be true, it\r\nby no means necessarily implies that he had purposely trained the animal\r\nto respond to them. In these observations of his he had builded better\r\nthan he knew--he evidently had no notion of their scientific\r\nsignificance. But the same thing might happen to those who were supposed\r\nto be somewhat less naive, as is shown by the experience of Mr.\r\nSchillings, who quite unconsciously, for many months had been giving not\r\nonly the finer, but also the grosser signs, and never guessed the true\r\nnature of affairs until I explained it to him. Nor was it an easy matter\r\nfor me to get at the facts involved in the process, although it now all\r\nappears so very simple.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is also true that Mr. von Osten knew nothing\r\nwhatever of the finer, more minute signals, such as the final jerk, the\r\nhead-movement upward, downward, etc., and it is difficult to conceive\r\nhow he might have gained any knowledge of them. We might perhaps\r\nconceive of four possible sources. He might have come upon them by\r\nchance. But it is extremely improbable that in the million of possible\r\nforms of signaling he should have hit upon those that at the same time\r\nrepresent the natural expressive movements. Or he might have derived a\r\nknowledge of them through a study of the pertinent literature. I have\r\nsearched diligently for such a source, in both the old and the modern\r\nliterature, but in vain. From the sixteenth century on, there is a\r\nseries of accounts of horses that were able to spell and to solve\r\nproblems in arithmetic, and the reports on learned dogs go back even to\r\nthe time of Justinian, in the middle of the sixth century.[107] All of\r\nthese animals were kept for purpose of speculation and were exhibited\r\nfor pecuniary reasons only. Nor does one read that any person could work\r\nwith these animals off-hand, which was the characteristic feature of the\r\nOsten horse.[AN] In many cases we find mention made of the signs to\r\nwhich the animals reacted. Thus for the beginning or stopping of the\r\nanimal's scraping or tapping, the signals were respectively raising and\r\nlowering of the eyes on the part of the trainer,[113] lowering and\r\nraising of the whip[114] or of the arm, stepping forward and\r\nbackward,[115] and as a closing signal a slight bending forward.[116]\r\nThe signals for beginning and ceasing to bark in the case of dogs, were\r\nthe trainer's commands to \"speak\", and, at the same time, his looking at\r\nthe dog, and then looking away for a closing sign;[117] or a\r\nmouth-movement on the part of the trainer and then a withdrawing of the\r\nleft hand which had been resting on the hip.[118] Among the signals for\r\nnodding and shaking the head we find the following mentioned: raising\r\nand lowering the hand or arm[119] or the whip;[120] a movement of the\r\nhand toward the horse's nose, as a signal for nodding, and an\r\narm-movement as a signal for shaking the head.[121] For this last, we\r\nfind recommended also a slight breathing upon the animal,[122] and--in\r\nthe case of dogs--a mouth-movement simulating blowing, or a turn of the\r\nfingers.[123] (We will not dwell upon the many signals for selecting\r\nobjects, which are mentioned, since we have already discussed this point\r\non page 230f). In all these instances it is plain that we have to do\r\nwith purely voluntary and \"artificial\" signals. The only example of\r\ninvoluntary signs which Mr. von Osten could have found in literature,\r\nwas that of Huggins's dog, which need not be considered here, since, as\r\nwas said on page 177, the really effective signs in that case were not\r\ndiscovered. A third means by which Mr. von Osten might have gained a\r\nknowledge of the involuntary, natural expressive signs, would have been\r\nby observing others. If he had had opportunity of observing another von\r\nOsten and another Hans, he might have gotten at the secret. But since\r\nthis was not the case, this possibility vanishes. A fourth possibility\r\nis self-observation. We would then have to assume that Mr. von Osten at\r\nfirst really tried to educate the horse to think, but soon recognized\r\nthe fruitlessness of such an attempt. At the same time, he then would\r\nhave noticed his own involuntary movements and their effect upon the\r\nhorse, and having noted them, voluntarily reduced their extent and\r\nutilized them in the training process. But here also there is much that\r\nmilitates against this assumption when we consider how great is the\r\ndifficulty of consciously refining movements which at first were rather\r\ncoarse, unless it be by the adjustment of the proper degree of\r\nconcentration of attention, a subtlety of method of which we could\r\nhardly believed Mr. von Osten capable. We must remember, also, that in\r\nthe first publication regarding Hans which, by the way, marks the\r\nbeginning of his career, (\"Das lesende und rechnende Pferd,\" by\r\nMajor-General E. Zobel, in the \"Weltspiegel\" of July 7, 1904), we may\r\nread the following: \"He (Mr. von Osten) is always willing to have the\r\nhorse undergo an examination on the part of a stranger, and promises\r\nthat after Hans has become fairly well acquainted he will display the\r\nsame degree of efficiency as he displays with the master, himself.\"\r\nThis occurred at a time when Mr. Schillings, the man who was destined to\r\nprove the truth of the statement, had not yet appeared on the scene. How\r\nwas Mr. von Osten to know beforehand that every questioner, who might\r\nappear, would execute the same movements that he himself had used? We\r\nwould recall also that not one in the great multitude of persons who\r\nworked successfully with the horse in the absence of Mr. von Osten, had\r\nnoticed, even in the slightest measure, any of these movements in\r\nthemselves. The position and repute of these persons vouches for their\r\nveracity,--among them were the writer of the article just mentioned, the\r\nCount zu Castell, Count Matuschka, Count von Eickstedt-Peterswaldt,\r\nGeneral Koering, Dr. Sander, Mr. H. Suermondt and Mr. H. von\r\nTepper-Laski. Some of these gentlemen were quite unwilling to believe\r\nthat they executed such movements. This happened in the case of Mr. von\r\nTepper-Laski, who had visited Hans ten times and who had, during the\r\ncourse of these visits, frequently worked alone with the horse and had\r\nreceived correct responses. Count Eickstedt, too, although he was one of\r\nthose who had been made acquainted with the nature of the movements\r\ninvolved before being allowed to visit the horse, was unable to note\r\nthem either in his observation of Mr. von Osten, or of himself, when, in\r\ncompliance with his own wish, he was left alone with Hans. Nor did any\r\nof the laboratory subjects, some of whom were well trained in\r\nintrospection, discover the true nature of affairs. They were thoroughly\r\nastonished when the facts of the case were explained to them. And I,\r\nalso, as was mentioned on page 100, did not become aware of my own\r\nmovements, until I had noted those of Mr. von Osten. In fine, everything\r\nwould indicate that we have here not an intention to deceive the\r\npublic, but a case of pure self-deception.[AO]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AN: There is only one, and I believe it is only a seeming\r\n    exception to be found in the literature on the subject. We are told\r\n    that about the year 1840 a French revenue official named Leonard had\r\n    two hunting dogs that, besides other things, were able to play at\r\n    dominoes, and this not only with their master, but with anyone and\r\n    without the master's assistance. The owner had educated them simply\r\n    for the fun of it, and not for pecuniary gain. This statement is\r\n    made by both writers who, apparently independently of one another,\r\n    have discussed the case, Youatt[108] and de Tarade.[109] De Tarade\r\n    himself played with them, and gives directions how to teach dogs to\r\n    play the game. But his exposition is so naive, and even ridiculous,\r\n    for those who know anything about the subject, that we do not\r\n    believe it necessary to attempt a detailed refutation. Youatt never\r\n    saw the animals. But he tells us that not only the dog's partner,\r\n    but also the master, sat at the game. Youatt's assertion, however,\r\n    that \"not the slightest intimation could have been given by Mr.\r\n    Leonard to the dog,\" but that the animal carried on the game by\r\n    means of its own observation and calculation, appears to me a rather\r\n    bold statement. After my own experience with dogs, I firmly believe\r\n    this to have been impossible. Hachet-Souplet,[110] who shares my\r\n    conviction, explains the matter as follows: the dog would simply\r\n    place a domino having the number of eyes named by his partner, thus\r\n    the 6 adjacent to the 6, the 3 to the 3, etc. But even so a great\r\n    deal would have to be attributed to the dog, (although in that case\r\n    real counting would by no means be absolutely necessary, for an\r\n    association between the number term and the total picture of the\r\n    corresponding group of eyes would suffice.) But we must note that\r\n    neither of the writers mentions that the numbers were always called\r\n    aloud by the partner. After the failure of the experiments of Sir\r\n    John Lubbock,[111] we must doubt very much if a dog is able to match\r\n    one domino with another having the same number of eyes. We are\r\n    therefore inclined to believe that this dog continually received\r\n    signs from its master. These signs probably were visual, perhaps\r\n    also auditory, and they were by no means involuntary. For in a book\r\n    on the training of animals, which Leonard, the owner of the dogs,\r\n    has published, and in which he describes minutely the method by\r\n    which they had been trained in their various accomplishments, he\r\n    does not mention with so much as a syllable the game of dominoes, a\r\n    thing which he certainly would have dwelt upon, if he had believed\r\n    in the animals' power of independent thought. He would not have\r\n    remained silent concerning this greatest--though only\r\n    apparent--achievement of his educational endeavors. But his whole\r\n    book is evidence that he was too wise to have thus deceived himself,\r\n    and our only alternative is to believe that he was playing a joke on\r\n    his credulous admirers.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AO: P. Wasmann, S. J. in the third edition of his book,\r\n    \"Instinkt und Intelligenz im Tierreich\" (Freiburg, Herder, 1905),\r\n    discusses the case of Hans and quotes from a letter I wrote him\r\n    concerning the matter. In the quotation an error has crept in, which\r\n    I would here correct. The statement is ascribed to me that \"Hans\r\n    differs from other horses only in his extraordinary power of\r\n    observation, an unintentional by-product of intentional training,\"\r\n    whereas in my letter I said: \"unintentional by-product of\r\n    intentional education.\"]\r\n\r\nThis self-deception is easily understood when we consider the two\r\npredominent characteristics of the man: the pedantry of the pedagogue,\r\nand his proneness to be possessed by a single idea, which is a\r\npeculiarity of those of an inventive turn of mind. Adhering closely to a\r\npreformed plan, he carefully and narrowly circumscribed the scope and\r\norder of instruction. He would not go on to the number 5 if he were not\r\nthoroughly convinced that the 4 had been completely mastered, nor would\r\nhe go on to a more difficult problem in multiplication, until he felt\r\ncertain that Hans was entirely proficient in the problems of the simpler\r\nsort. If he had ever put a question to Hans before its regular order, he\r\nwould have discovered, to his amazement, that there really existed no\r\ndifficulties for Hans, and also that the horse really required no\r\nappreciable time to acquire new material. Mr. von Osten would have had a\r\nlike experience if he had asked Hans concerning the value of Chinese\r\ncoins or the logarithm of 1000. However, he never did anything of the\r\nkind, but always adhered closely to his plan. He required the questioner\r\nto say: \"2 and 2\", and never \"2 plus 2\". Nor were capitals or Latin\r\nscript to be used in the written material. And if upon request he did\r\nso, he did it, without faith in the result, and hence there was\r\nfailure. And so he declared that \"if you use Latin script Hans becomes\r\nconfused and will be out of sorts for several weeks thereafter.\" Mr. von\r\nOsten is, and ever will remain, the schoolmaster, and will never become\r\nthe psychologist, the \"soul-vivisectionist\". Who would work a child with\r\nsuch puzzling questions? and Hans was to him like a child. Thus the old\r\nman believed himself to be a witness of a continuous, organic\r\ndevelopment of the animal soul--a development which in reality had no\r\nother existence than in his own imagination.\r\n\r\nAdded to this pedantry was an extraordinary uncritical attitude of mind,\r\ninduced by his obsession by one favorite idea, which blinded him to all\r\nobjections. He met objectionable observations on the part of others in\r\none of two ways. One method was by attributing to Hans certain\r\nremarkable qualities, such as an extraordinary keenness of hearing and a\r\nwonderful power of memory, or again, certain defects, such as moodiness\r\nand stubbornness,--which as a matter of fact, were only so many\r\nback-doors by which he might escape from the necessity of offering\r\nadequate explanations. When Hans was able to give off-hand a gentleman's\r\nname which he had heard years before, it was called a case of\r\nextraordinary memory. When the horse insisted that 2 times 2 was 5, he\r\nmaintained that it was an example of animal stubbornness. There was\r\nstill a simpler method of overcoming inconvenient objections and that\r\nwas by ignoring them altogether. The number 1, the simplest and most\r\nfundamental in the system of numbers, was one of the most difficult for\r\nHans. (Page 67f.). Mr. von Osten was aware of this, but thought little\r\nof it. During the very first visit of Professor Stumpf, Mr. von Osten\r\nasked the horse: \"By how much must you increase the numerator of the\r\nfraction 7/8, in order to get a whole number?\" Hans repeatedly answered\r\nincorrectly and always tapped numbers that were too great. The same\r\nquestion was then asked concerning the fraction 5/8, and immediately\r\nthere was a correct response, (the favorite number 3). Mr. von Osten\r\nsaid very naively: \"In the case of the difference of 1, he always goes\r\nwrong. It was just what I expected.\" Mr. von Osten still relates that\r\nthe distinction between right and left created far greater difficulty\r\nfor Hans than all of the work in fractions, and that even to-day it is\r\nnot thoroughly established; also, that the selection of colored cloths\r\nis often a failure still, although it was one of the first things in\r\nwhich he was given instruction. It appears never to have dawned upon Mr.\r\nvon Osten that the arts in which Hans seemed to excel, also formed the\r\nstanding repertoire of so many trained horses, regarding whom it was\r\nwell-known that they owed all of their cleverness to the training given\r\nthem by their masters. This fact alone should have induced him to make\r\nsome form of critical investigation.\r\n\r\nWhen Hans suddenly became a celebrity, and he, himself, the object of an\r\nenthusiastic following, the whole affair evidently took Mr. von Osten\r\noff his feet. Strangers took the further instruction of the horse in\r\ncharge, and the rate and degree of Hans's progress became disconcerting.\r\nOne day it came to pass that the horse even understood French, and the\r\nold gentleman, whose apostolic exterior had always exerted a high degree\r\nof suggestion upon his admirers, in turn fell captive to the spell of\r\nretroactive mass-suggestion. He no longer was uneasy concerning the most\r\nglaring kinds of failure. On one occasion he even insisted upon the\r\ncompletion of a series of tests in which procedure was \"without\r\nknowledge\", which promised no results whatever. \"The animal's\r\nstubbornness must be broken,\" he commented. On the other hand, he\r\nregarded every criticism as a form of personal insult. And once he\r\nshowed a member of the committee of the Society for the Protection of\r\nAnimals the door, because the man, without having looked at his watch,\r\nwanted to show it to Hans and ask him the time. Many other critics had\r\nsimilar experiences.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the remarks of this chapter, our judgment must be as\r\nfollows: It is in the highest degree improbable that Mr. von Osten\r\npurposely trained the horse to respond to certain cues. It is also\r\nimprobable that he knew that in every test he was giving signals,\r\n(although I can form no judgment concerning what happened after the\r\npublication of the latest report). To assume the contrary would land us\r\nin the midst of insoluble contradictions of the many ascertained facts\r\nin the case. The explanation here essayed, however, should prevent that.\r\nTo be sure, we, must then reckon with curious inner contradictions in\r\nMr. von Osten's character. But such contradictions are to be found, upon\r\nearnest analysis, in nearly every human character. And Mr. von Osten may\r\nsay with the poet: \"Ich bin kein ausgekluegelt Buch. Ich bin ein Mensch\r\nmit seinem Widerspruch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we would make a brief summary of the status of Mr. von Osten's horse\r\nin the light of these investigations and try to understand what is the\r\nbearing upon the question of animal psychology in general, we may make\r\nthe following statements.\r\n\r\nHans's accomplishments are founded first upon a one-sided development of\r\nthe power of perceiving the slightest movements of the questioner,\r\nsecondly upon the intense and continued, but equally one-sided, power of\r\nattention, and lastly upon a rather limited memory, by means of which\r\nthe animal is able to associate perceptions of movement with a small\r\nnumber of movements of its own which have become thoroughly habitual.\r\n\r\nThe horse's ability to perceive movements greatly exceeds that of the\r\naverage man. This superiority is probably due to a different\r\nconstitution of the retina, and perhaps also of the brain.\r\n\r\nOnly a diminishingly small number of auditory stimuli are involved.\r\n\r\nAll conclusions with regard to the presence of emotional reactions, such\r\nas stubbornness, etc., have been shown to be without warrant. With\r\nregard to the emotional life we are justified in concluding from the\r\nbehavior of the horse, that the desire for food is the only effective\r\nspring to action.\r\n\r\nThe gradual formation of the associations mentioned above, between the\r\nperception of movement and the movements of the horse himself, is in all\r\nprobability not to be regarded as the result of a training-process, but\r\nas an unintentional by-product of an unsuccessful attempt at real\r\neducation, which, though in no sense a training-process, still produced\r\nresults equivalent to those of such a process.\r\n\r\nAll higher psychic processes which find expression in the horse's\r\nbehavior, are those of the questioner. His relationship to the horse is\r\nbrought about almost wholly by involuntary movements of the most minute\r\nkind. The interrelation existing between ideas having a high degree of\r\naffective coloring and the musculature of the body, (which is brought to\r\nlight in this process), is by no means a novel fact for us.\r\nNevertheless, it is possible that this case may be of no small value, on\r\naccount of the great difficulties which are usually met in the attempt\r\nto establish experimentally the more delicate details in this field.\r\n\r\nAnd, returning to the considerations of the first chapter, if we ask\r\nwhat contributions does this case make toward a solution of the problem\r\nof animal consciousness, we may state the following: The proof which was\r\nexpected by so many, that animals possess the power of thought, was not\r\nfurnished by Hans. He has served to weaken, rather than strengthen, the\r\nposition of these enthusiasts. But we must generalize this negative\r\nconclusion of ours with care,--for Hans cannot without further\r\nqualification be regarded as normal. Hans is a domesticated animal. It\r\nis possible (though the opposite is usually assumed), that our animals\r\nhave suffered in the development of their mental life, as a result of\r\nthe process of domestication. To be sure, in some respects they have\r\nbecome more specialized than their wild kin, (e. g., our hunting dogs),\r\nand in their habits they have become adapted largely to suit our needs.\r\nThis latter is shown by all the anecdotes concerning \"clever\" dogs,\r\nhorses, etc. But with the loss of their freedom they have also gradually\r\nbeen deprived of the urgent need of self-preservation and of the\r\npreservation of their species, and thus lack one of the greatest forces\r\nthat make for psychic development. And often their artificial selection\r\nand culture has been with a view to the development of muscle and sinew,\r\nfat and wool, all at the expense of brain development.[AP] Our horses\r\nare, as a rule, sentenced to an especially dull mode of life. Chained in\r\nstalls (and usually dark stalls at that,) during three-fourths of their\r\nlives, and more than any other domestic animal, enslaved for thousands\r\nof years by reins and whip, they have become estranged from their\r\nnatural impulses, and owing to continued confinement they may perhaps\r\nhave suffered even in their sensory life. A gregarious animal, yet kept\r\nconstantly in isolation, intended by nature to range over vast areas,\r\nyet confined to his narrow courtyard, and deprived of opportunity for\r\nsexual activity,--he has been forced by a process of education to\r\ndevelop along lines quite opposite to his native characteristics.\r\nNevertheless, I believe that it is very doubtful if it would have been\r\npossible by other methods, even, to call forth in the horse the ability\r\nto think. Presumably, however, it might be possible, under conditions\r\nand with methods of instruction more in accord with the life-needs of\r\nthe horse, to awaken in a fuller measure those mental activities which\r\nwould be called into play to meet those needs.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote AP: Buffon,[124] the great naturalist, expresses himself\r\n    not less pessimistically in his own brilliant manner: \"Un animal\r\n    domestique est un esclave dont on s'amuse, dont on se sert, dont on\r\n    abuse, qu'on altere, qu'on depaise et que l'on denature.\"]\r\n\r\nThough our investigations do not give support to the fantastic accounts\r\nof animal intelligence given by Brehms, they by no means warrant a\r\nreturn to Descartes and his theory of the animal-machine (as is\r\nadvocated by a number of over-critical investigators). We cannot deny\r\nthe validity of conclusions from analogy without denying at the same\r\ntime the possibility of an animal psychology--indeed of all psychology.\r\nAnd all such conclusions indicate that the lower forms possess the power\r\nof sense-perception, that they, like us, presumably have at their\r\ndisposal certain images, and that their psychic life is to a large\r\nextent also constituted of mere image-associations, and that they too,\r\nlearn by experience. Also that they are susceptible to feelings of\r\npleasure and of pain and also to emotions, as jealousy, fear, etc.,\r\nthough these may be only of the kind which have a direct relation to\r\ntheir life-needs. We are in no position to deny _a priori_ the\r\npossibility of traces of conceptual thought in those forms nearest man\r\nin the scale--whether living in their natural manner or under artificial\r\nconditions. And even less so since the final word has not yet been\r\nspoken regarding the nature of conceptual thinking itself. All that is\r\ncertain is that nothing of the kind has been proven to occur in the\r\nlower forms, and that as yet not even a suitable method of discovering\r\nits existence has been suggested. But the community of those elementary\r\nprocesses of mental life which we have mentioned above is in itself\r\nenough to connect the life of the lower forms with ours, and imposes\r\nupon us the duty of regarding them not as objects for exploitation and\r\nmistreatment, but as worthy of rational care and affection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT I\r\n\r\nMR. VON OSTEN'S METHOD OF INSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n[BY C. STUMPF]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a report of the account, which Mr. von Osten gave\r\nProfessor Schumann and me, of the method which he had used in the\r\ninstruction of the horse, and which was illustrated by actual\r\ndemonstrations. I cannot testify, of course, that Mr. von Osten really\r\ndid adhere to this method throughout the four years in which he tutored\r\nthe horse, but I will say that I have several good reasons for believing\r\nthat it was impossible for him to have trumped up this make-believe\r\nscheme afterward, merely to mislead us. Among the reasons are the\r\nfollowing: He was always ready to give a detailed explanation of any\r\nquestion which we might interpose; the written statements of Major von\r\nKeller, who has known Mr. von Osten for a period of fifteen years; the\r\ntestimony of General Zobel, who became acquainted with the whole process\r\nfully a year before any public exhibitions were given; the accounts\r\ngiven by the tenants in Mr. von Osten's house, who for years saw the\r\nprocess of instruction going on in the courtyard of the apartment\r\nbuilding,--according to their account his intercourse with the horse\r\nwas like that with a child at school,--he made much use of the apparatus\r\nand never did they notice anything like an habituation to respond to\r\ncertain signals; and finally the appearance of the apparatus\r\nitself--some of which could not be bought at second hand--was most\r\nconvincing.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus used for the work in arithmetic consisted mainly of a set\r\nof large wooden pins, a set of smaller ones (such as are to be had in\r\ntoy-shops), a counting-machine, such as is commonly used in the schools,\r\na chart upon which were pasted the numbers from 1 to 100, and finally\r\nthe digits, cut large and in brass and suspended from a string. For the\r\nwork in reading Mr. von Osten used the chart shown in the frontispiece\r\nof this book. Here we have the letters of the alphabet in small German\r\nscript with numbers written below which serve to indicate the row, and\r\nwhat place in that row, the letters occupy. For tones, a small, child's\r\norgan was used with the diatonic scale C^1 to C^2, and for instruction\r\nin colors, a number of colored cloths were used.\r\n\r\nThe work in arithmetic began by placing a single wooden pin in front of\r\nHans and then commanding him: \"Raise the foot!--One!\" Here we must\r\nassume that the horse had learned to respond to the command to raise the\r\nfoot during the preceding period, when tapping in general had been\r\ntaught. In order to get the horse to learn that he was to give only one\r\ntap, Mr. von Osten tried to control the tapping by means of holding the\r\nanimal's foot, just as a teacher tries to aid a pupil in learning to\r\nwrite by guiding his hand. He repeated this exercise so often that\r\nfinally the single tap was made. And always the right foot was insisted\r\nupon. Bread and carrots were the constant rewards.\r\n\r\nTwo of the pins were now set up and the command given: \"Raise the\r\nfoot!--One, two!\" Mr. von Osten again aided the establishment of the\r\nproper association by using his hand as before. At the same time the two\r\npins were pointed out, and the order was always without exception from\r\nleft to right. Gradually it became unnecessary to touch the foot or to\r\npoint to the pins, and instead the question was introduced: \"How many\r\nare there?\", in order that the horse should become accustomed to these\r\nwords as an invitation to give the taps when he saw the wooden pins\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nThen three pins were taken and the words \"one, two, three\" were spoken,\r\nand so on. In naming a number the preceding ones were always named along\r\nwith it, in order that the normal order might thus be learned at the\r\nsame time. Later the number alone, without the preceding ones, sufficed\r\nto elicit the proper number of taps. The last word of the series thus\r\nbecomes characteristic of the series as a whole. It differs from all the\r\nothers, and thus becomes the sign for the whole series of numbers thus\r\nnamed, each of which arises as a memory image at the proper place in the\r\nseries and is accompanied by a tap of the foot. Thus, Mr. von Osten at\r\nany rate had accounted to himself for his success.\r\n\r\nBut Hans was not to acquire merely this relatively mechanical process of\r\ncounting (hardly to be called counting), but he was to acquire also some\r\nmeaning content for the number terms. For this purpose everything\r\ndepended upon the concept \"and\". Only he who can grasp its meaning will\r\nbe able to understand a number. 2 is 1 _and_ 1, 3 is 2 _and_ 1. Mr. von\r\nOsten had someone hold a large cloth before the horse, where the wooden\r\npins usually were placed. He then had the cloth taken up and he would\r\npronounce emphatically the word \"and\". After this had been done a number\r\nof times, he put up two of the pins and obscured them by the cloth. The\r\ncloth was again raised and the word \"and\" pronounced. Then Hans, as a\r\nresult of his previous instruction (so Mr. von Osten thought) would give\r\ntwo taps at sight of the pins. The thing was repeated with three pins,\r\nthen with one, and so on, and the horse would always execute the proper\r\nnumber of taps.\r\n\r\nNow, five pins were set up, the three to the right being covered by the\r\ncloth. The horse tapped twice and Mr. von Osten said \"two\". Then the\r\ncloth was raised, Hans gave three further taps, and Mr. von Osten said\r\n\"and three\" with emphasis.\r\n\r\nIn this simple manner he tried to get the horse to understand that the\r\nthree belongs to the two, and that both together make five. The image of\r\nthe five pins as it was known from previous experience, was to be\r\nassociated with the combined groups of two and three, and conversely, it\r\nwas to be reproduced when these groups were presented. Later the cloth\r\nand pins were omitted and the question was asked: \"How much is two and\r\nthree?\". The horse tapped five times. It had learned how to add. Still\r\nthis could be regarded only as a mechanical process, if the horse were\r\nable to add only those numbers which had been presented together one or\r\nmore times in the manner just described. And so long as we remained\r\nwithin the first decade, we could get twenty-five binary combinations\r\nwhose sum does not exceed 10 (counting inverted orders we would have\r\nforty-five binary permutations),--all of which might have been practised\r\nseparately. But as a matter of fact, Mr. von Osten did not take this\r\ncourse, for as he himself says, he allowed Hans to discover a great\r\ndeal for himself. \"Hans had to develop the multiplication table for\r\nhimself.\"--With larger numbers and more addends, the number of\r\ncombinations becomes so great that there can be no doubt they were not\r\npractised separately.\r\n\r\nSince, after all this preliminary instruction, Hans really began to give\r\nsolutions of new problems, the master believed that this was proof that\r\nhe had succeeded in inculcating the inner meaning of the number\r\nconcepts, and not merely an external association of memory images with\r\ncertain movement responses. But he always remained within the sphere of\r\nthe ideas thus developed, and adhered closely to the customary\r\nvocabulary and its usage. Every new concept, each additional word was\r\nexplained anew.\r\n\r\nIt would not be legitimate to condemn the whole procedure from the very\r\nbeginning on the ground of the horse's lack of knowledge of language or\r\nof its use. It was Mr. von Osten's aim to convey to the horse an\r\nunderstanding of the language, by means of sense-presentations, adequate\r\nto give rise to the proper sense-perceptions. Helen Keller and other\r\nblind deaf-mutes have been educated to an understanding of the language\r\nwithout the aid of vision and hearing. They have come to it through the\r\nsense of touch alone. Everything depends upon whether or not the\r\npredisposition for it is present. And it was quite rational that Mr. von\r\nOsten should have chosen counting and arithmetical calculation as the\r\nprocesses by which to make his attack upon the animal mind, for as a\r\nmatter of fact, nowhere else is it so easy to bridge the gap between\r\nperception and conception and nowhere else can the sign of success or\r\nfailure be perceived so readily as in the handling of numbers. It is\r\nunfortunate, however, that he did not utilize these same signs for\r\npurposes of counter-testing also, as, for instance, by inquiring for the\r\ncube root of 729. But he was prevented from doing this by his close\r\nadherence to his pedagogical principle and by his unquestioning faith in\r\nthe soundness of the entire procedure.\r\n\r\nIn teaching multiplication the counting machine was used. Two of the ten\r\nballs on one of the rods were pushed far to the left, thus: 00. \"How\r\nmany are there?\" Two taps. \"Very well. That is once two.\" Another group\r\nof two was pushed to the left, at a short interval from the first group,\r\nthus: 00 00. \"How many times two balls are there?\" was asked, with a\r\ndecided movement of the hand toward the two groups. Two taps. \"How many,\r\ntherefore, are two times two?\" Four taps.\r\n\r\nThe horse was supposed to learn the meaning of the word \"times\" by means\r\nof the spatial separation of the groups; he was to be taught to notice\r\nand to count the groups, and also the number of units in a single group.\r\nThree times two then meant three groups with two units in each group.\r\nThe horse was supposedly aided by the following factors: the relative\r\nnearness of the units belonging to one group, as over against the space\r\ninterval between the groups themselves; also that the groups were\r\npointed out as wholes in connection with the emphatic enunciation of the\r\nwords 'once, twice,' etc.; and finally the touching and raising of the\r\nhorse's foot by means of the hand until all the desired associations of\r\nthe ideas with one another and with the corresponding tapping movements\r\nwere quite perfect.\r\n\r\nSubtraction was taught in the following manner. Five pins were set up;\r\nthe horse tapped five times. Mr. von Osten then removed two of them and\r\nsaid emphatically: \"I take away,--minus. How many are still standing?\"\r\nThe horse tapped three times. Here, too, there was at first some\r\nassistance by means of the hand to get the tapping.\r\n\r\nIn division four balls were first pushed to the left end of the rod,\r\nthus: 0000. \"How many balls are there to the left?\" Four taps. They were\r\nnow divided into two pairs, thus: 00 00. Pointing to the units of one\r\ngroup, the teacher asks: \"There are always how many in the group?\" Two\r\ntaps. Three groups were formed, thus: 00 00 00. \"There are now how many\r\nballs to the left?\" Six taps. \"And there are always how many in each\r\ngroup?\", (pointing at them). Two taps. \"And how often is two contained\r\nin six?\", (pointing to the groups consecutively). Three taps, etc.\r\n\r\nThe ideas of 'part', of 'whole', and of 'being contained' were\r\nillustrated by means of a chalk line which was interrupted in one or\r\nmore places by erasure.\r\n\r\nIn all these operations Mr. von Osten adhered strictly to the rule, and\r\nrequired others to do so too, that the number upon which the operation\r\nwas performed, must be mentioned first. Thus, one was not to say, \"take\r\n3 away from 7\", but \"from 7 take away 3.\" Otherwise, he believed, Hans\r\nwould become easily confused. Also one was not allowed to say \"to\r\nmultiply\", but to \"take\" a certain number so many \"times\". He, himself,\r\nnever departed from this practice.\r\n\r\nWe will not go into the details of the method by which Hans was taught\r\nthe meaning of the number signs, of the signs of operation, of the\r\nnumbers above 10, or the significance of \"digits\", \"tens\", etc. Only\r\nthis,--when in problems in addition the sum was greater than 10, the 10\r\nwas first tapped and then the remainder of the number added to the 10.\r\nThus: \"You are to add 9 and 5. How much must you add to the 9 to have\r\n10?\" One tap. \"But now, you were to add not merely 1, but 5; how much\r\nhave you still to add to the 10?\"--Four taps. In like manner, whenever\r\nthe addends were below 20 or 30 and the sum above 20 or 30, Mr. von\r\nOsten would ask for the 20 or 30 taps first. He thought that he was thus\r\ngiving his pupil an ever firmer grasp upon the principle of the\r\nstructure of our number system, in which all higher numbers are\r\nconstituted of tens and digits. For the same reason he used at first,\r\ninstead of the words 'eleven' and 'twelve' ('elf' and 'zwoelf' in the\r\nGerman), expressions which in English might be rendered as 'one-teen'\r\nand 'two-teen' ('einzehn' and 'zweizehn' in the German); and only later,\r\nafter the animal had seemingly mastered the meaning in question, did Mr.\r\nvon Osten replace them by the usual forms.\r\n\r\nAll this was beautifully conceived and might perhaps form the basis for\r\nthe instruction of primitive races. But it is of immediate interest for\r\nus only because it enables us to better understand the origin of the\r\nconviction under which Mr. von Osten and his followers labored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT II\r\n\r\nTHE REPORT OF SEPTEMBER 12, 1904\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned came together for the purpose of investigating the\r\nquestion whether or not there is involved in the feats of the horse of\r\nMr. von Osten anything of the nature of tricks, that is, intentional\r\ninfluence or aid, on the part of the questioner. After a careful\r\ninvestigation they are unanimously agreed that such signs are out of the\r\nquestion under the conditions which were maintained during this\r\ninvestigation. This decision in no wise takes into account the character\r\nof the men exhibiting the horse, and who are known to most of the\r\nundersigned: In spite of the most attentive observation, nothing in the\r\nway of movements or other forms of expression which might have served as\r\na sign, could be discovered. In order to obviate involuntary movements\r\non the part of those present, one series of tests was made with only Mr.\r\nBusch present. Among these tests were some in which, according to his\r\nprofessional judgment, the possibility of tricks of the sort commonly\r\nused in training, was excluded. Another series of tests was made in such\r\na way that the correct answers to the questions which Mr. von Osten put\r\nto the horse, were unknown to the questioner. From previous observation\r\nthe greater number of the undersigned also know of a large number of\r\ncases in which, during the absence of Mr. von Osten and Mr. Schillings,\r\nother persons were likewise able to obtain correct responses from the\r\nhorse. Among these were some cases in which the questioner did not know\r\nthe correct solution of the problem or was mistaken about it. And\r\nlastly, several of the undersigned have become acquainted with the\r\nmethod which Mr. von Osten used, which has little in common with methods\r\nof training, and is patterned after the instruction given in the\r\nelementary schools. As a result of these observations the undersigned\r\nare of the opinion that unintentional signs of the kind which are at\r\npresent familiar, are likewise excluded. They are unanimously agreed\r\nthat this much is certain: This is a case which appears in principle to\r\ndiffer from any hitherto discovered, and has nothing in common with\r\ntraining, in the usual sense of that word, and therefore is worthy of a\r\nserious and incisive investigation.\r\n\r\nBERLIN, September 12, 1904.\r\n\r\n  PAUL BUSCH, Circus-manager.\r\n  OTTO, COUNT ZU CASTELL-RUeDENHAUSEN.\r\n  DR.

(See page 8). Referring once more\r\n    to the misunderstanding mentioned on page 3, I would say that the\r\n    closing sentence of the report is here re-given literally as it then\r\n    appeared. C. St.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important meetings occurred on the 11th and 12th of September and\r\nboth of them extended over four hours. The greatest difficulty was\r\noccasioned by the condition laid down by Mr. von Osten: that we were to\r\nwork without him from the very beginning. In a certain sense this\r\ncondition had been met once before when Mr. Schillings appeared upon the\r\nscene, a man whose fairness ought to be doubted by none. He came utterly\r\nskeptical, and yet in the course of a week he learned to handle the\r\nhorse and received responses regularly. However, since the public had\r\nbegun to doubt Mr. Schillings also, another person had to attempt the\r\nrole of questioner. Count zu Castell tried to do this and practised for\r\nsome days before the meetings, but his success--although of no small\r\nmoment--was not great enough to be convincing.\r\n\r\nIn apprising Mr. von Osten of this fact we caused a veritable\r\ncatastrophe. He declared in a most decisive manner that he would have to\r\ninsist upon the condition he had imposed, since the public demanded it,\r\nand he could never assist in any tests, until he had been cleared of the\r\nsuspicion of having descended to the use of tricks. If it should take\r\nweeks to accustom the horse to a new questioner, there would be no\r\nalternative but to wait that length of time.\r\n\r\nA happy circumstance helped us out of our difficulty. We had chanced in\r\nour discussion to mention the experience of Dr. Miessner, a member of\r\nthe commission, who on the day before had gone to witness an exhibition\r\nof the mare \"Clever Rosa\", and who believed that he had succeeded in\r\ndiscovering the tricks involved. There was a sudden change in Mr. von\r\nOsten's attitude. He expressed his willingness to undergo the most\r\nstringent examination and agreed to anything in the way of conditions of\r\ncontrol, challenging even the proven ability of Dr. Miessner. \"I have\r\nneither whip nor rod, as had the man in the exhibition, and agree to any\r\nprecautionary measures you may care to take.\"\r\n\r\nAfter he had gone, the commission decided to ask him to have the horse\r\nperform one of the more common, simple, feats. They were going to watch\r\nhim very closely. Different members were assigned the task of attending\r\nto different parts of his body (head, eyes, right hand, left hand, etc.)\r\nwhile Mr. Busch, since he was the most proficient in the detection of\r\ntricks, was to regard the total behavior of the man.\r\n\r\nThe exhibitions included the indication of the day of the week by means\r\nof taps, the day just past, the day ahead, its date, arithmetical\r\nproblems, and the counting of rings strung upon a rod. Messrs. Grabow\r\nand Hahn interpolated a few tests themselves, in which they did the\r\nquestioning. All tests were successful.\r\n\r\nMr. von Osten withdrew, and in comparison of notes which followed, Mr.\r\nBusch, as well as all the others, declared that they had discovered\r\nnothing of the nature of a visible sign. Mr. Busch said that he had also\r\nkept an eye on the spectators and had noticed nothing there.\r\nNevertheless, he desired to see Mr. von Osten go through one series with\r\nno one else but himself (Busch) present.\r\n\r\nThis was done, and on this occasion a number of tests were made in the\r\nrecognition of colored cloths. The horse was required to indicate, by\r\ntapping, the place in the series which the cloth occupied and was then\r\nasked to bring the green or the red, as the case might be, in his mouth.\r\nFurthermore, he was asked to approach that one of the five gentlemen\r\nstanding at a distance, whose photograph had been shown him. Then he was\r\nrequested to spell the words \"Rat\" and \"Busch\" according to the method\r\nwhich he had been taught. Nearly all of these tests were likewise\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIn the conference which followed, Mr. Busch again declared that he had\r\nnoticed no trace of a sign; he maintained that, in the selecting of\r\ncolored cloths (especially when they were placed so closely together)\r\nand in the approach toward a person, there was no possibility whatever\r\nthat some trick was being used.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of September 12th, Mr. von Osten agreed to two sets\r\nof experiments.\r\n\r\n1. Another man was to put the question to the horse. Mr. von Osten\r\nhimself was to stand, back to back to the questioner and to bend\r\nforward, so that he was effectually hidden from the horse's view, yet\r\ncould, by means of occasional calls, make his presence known to the\r\nanimal. The assumption was that it would be conducive to success if the\r\nhorse knew that the master was present and was awaiting the answer, and\r\nyet at the same time the possibility of receiving a sign was obviated.\r\n\r\n2. Another man in Mr. von Osten's absence was to ask the horse to tap a\r\ncertain number. Then the questioner was to leave, and Mr. von Osten,\r\nreturning, was to ask the horse to perform some arithmetical process\r\nwith the number which was thus unknown to the master. Mr. von Osten said\r\nthat he thought that this method was somewhat risky, since the horse\r\nwould be aware that he, Mr. von Osten, did not know the number, and\r\nmight therefore be in a humor to play some prank.\r\n\r\nThe questions of the first sort were answered with but very few errors.\r\nMr. Hahn and Count zu Castell asked simple questions in arithmetic. When\r\nMr. von Osten withdrew into the stable, the count put several other\r\nproblems, among them the counting of persons and of windows, all of\r\nwhich were solved correctly.\r\n\r\nBetween the first and second series of tests the following experiments\r\nwere interpolated. The names of six members of the commission were\r\nwritten upon six slates respectively, which were then suspended from a\r\nstring. Mr. von Osten pointed to one of the men and asked: \"On which of\r\nthe slates is this gentleman's name to be found?\" The correct number was\r\ntapped in every case. The command to approach the slate in question was\r\nalso obeyed as a rule, although this was not as uniformly successful as\r\ntapping.\r\n\r\nIn the conference which followed, Mr. Busch declared that the feats\r\nappeared inconceivable to him; and again none of the men had noted\r\nanything in the way of signs.\r\n\r\nNow followed the second series of tests mentioned above. In order to be\r\nsure to get the correct responses, Mr. Schillings, who up to this point\r\nhad not been present at any of the experiments, was asked to put the\r\nquestions to the horse. Mr. von Osten went into the house, accompanied\r\nby a member of the commission. And again, Mr. Schillings would go out\r\nbefore the second part of the test, without having met Mr. von Osten.\r\n\r\nFive tests were made in this way. They were not attended by such amazing\r\nsuccess as were the preceding ones, but nevertheless the results were\r\nsurprising. The horse nearly always repeated the number itself, instead\r\nof performing the operation required. Since, however, Mr. Schillings,\r\nowing to a misunderstanding, had, in the first two cases, said to the\r\nhorse: \"You are to repeat this number for Mr. von Osten\", the errors\r\nmight appear to be a result of this request.\r\n\r\nAt the final discussion, the result of which was the unanimous\r\ndeclaration which was given for publication, not only the data obtained\r\nduring these two sessions, but also the earlier experiences of some of\r\nthe members of the commission were taken into consideration. None of the\r\ntests witnessed could be referred to chance or to the use of tricks.\r\nCount zu Castell pointed out that in the course of eight days he had\r\nelicited forty correct responses from the horse, among them some in\r\nregard to which he himself had been momentarily in error. Other members\r\nrecalled the many instances in previous exhibitions, during which both\r\nMr. Schillings and Mr. von Osten were absent, when questions were put to\r\nthe horse by others. The commission also had access to a detailed\r\naccount written by Professor Stumpf on Mr. von Osten's method of\r\ninstruction, based on the explanations and demonstrations which Mr. von\r\nOsten had himself given. As a result of these considerations the\r\ncommission felt under obligations to give public expression to its\r\nconviction. In the report it limited itself, however, to the purely\r\nnegative side--principally in denying the use of tricks,--and expressed\r\nno opinion with regard to the actual genesis of the horse's\r\naccomplishments, since it believed that there was great possibility that\r\nother factors were involved which ought to be carefully investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENT IV\r\n\r\nTHE REPORT OF DECEMBER 9TH, 1904\r\n\r\n\r\nTogether with Dr. E. von Hornbostel and Mr. O. Pfungst, I have tried\r\nduring the past few weeks to find an explanation of the accomplishments\r\nof the horse 'Hans' by the experimental method. We had access to the\r\nhorse in the absence of the master and groom. The results are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe horse failed in his responses whenever the solution of the problem\r\nthat was given him was unknown to any of those present. For instance,\r\nwhen a written number or the objects to be counted were placed before\r\nthe horse, but were invisible to everyone else, and especially to the\r\nquestioner, he failed to respond properly. Therefore he can neither\r\ncount, nor read, nor solve problems in arithmetic.\r\n\r\nThe horse failed again whenever he was prevented by means of\r\nsufficiently large blinders from seeing the persons, and especially the\r\nquestioner, to whom the solution was known. He therefore required some\r\nsort of visual aid.\r\n\r\nThese aids need not, however,--and this is the peculiarly interesting\r\nfeature in the case,--be given intentionally. The proof for this is\r\nfound in the fact that in the absence of Mr. von Osten the horse gave\r\ncorrect replies to a large number of persons; and to be more specific,\r\nMr. Schillings and later Mr. Pfungst, after working with the horse for\r\na short time, regularly received correct answers, without their being in\r\nany way conscious of having given any kind of signal.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can see, the following explanation is the only one that will\r\ncomport with these facts. The horse must have learned, in the course of\r\nthe long period of problem-solving, to attend ever more closely, while\r\ntapping, to the slight changes in bodily posture with which the master\r\nunconsciously accompanied the steps in his own thought-processes, and to\r\nuse these as closing signals. The motive for this direction and\r\nstraining of attention was the regular reward in the form of carrots and\r\nbread, which attended it. This unexpected kind of independent activity\r\nand the certainty and precision of the perception of minimal movements\r\nthus attained, are astounding in the highest degree.\r\n\r\nThe movements which call forth the horse's reaction, are so extremely\r\nslight in the case of Mr. von Osten, that it is easily comprehensible\r\nhow it was possible that they should escape the notice even of practised\r\nobservers. Mr. Pfungst, however, whose previous laboratory experience\r\nhad made him keen in the perception of visual stimuli of slightest\r\nduration and extent, succeeded in recognizing in Mr. von Osten the\r\ndifferent kinds of movements which were the basis of the various\r\naccomplishments of the horse. Furthermore, he succeeded in controlling\r\nhis own movements, (of which he had hitherto been unconscious), in the\r\npresence of the horse, and finally became so proficient that he could\r\nreplace these unintentional movements by intentional ones. He can now\r\ncall forth at will all the various reactions of the horse by making the\r\nproper kind of voluntary movements, without asking the relevant question\r\nor giving any sort of command. But Mr. Pfungst meets with the same\r\nsuccess when he does not attend to the movements to be made, but rather\r\nfocuses, as intently as possible, upon the number desired, since in that\r\ncase the necessary movement occurs whether he wills it or not. In the\r\nnear future he will give a special detailed report of his observations,\r\nwhich gives promise of becoming a valuable contribution to the study of\r\ninvoluntary movements. Also he will give an account of our tests and of\r\nthe mechanism of the various accomplishments of the horse. We must also\r\ndefer, till then, the disproof of certain seemingly relevant arguments\r\nin favor of the horse's power of independent thought.\r\n\r\nSome defenders of the view which maintains the horse's rationality may\r\nurge that it was only through our experiments that the animal became\r\ntrained and spoiled in so far as the ability to think is concerned. They\r\nare refuted in this, however, by the fact that the horse still continues\r\nto solve problems involving decimal fractions and to determine calendar\r\ndates for Mr. von Osten, as brilliantly as ever, as is shown by his\r\nrecent demonstration before a large group of spectators. That these\r\nresults are now being achieved in a manner essentially different from\r\nformerly is nothing but a bare assertion.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, now that the possibility has been established that\r\nthese wonderful results may be obtained in all their complexity by means\r\nof intentional signs, many will question whether Mr. von Osten did not\r\nhimself train the horse from the very beginning to respond to these\r\nsigns. No one has the right, however, to charge an old man, who has\r\nnever had a blemish on his reputation, with having invented a most\r\nrefined network of lies, if the facts can be explained in a\r\nsatisfactory manner in some other rational way. And this can be done in\r\nthis case. For we have seen that there is another alternative, other\r\nthan the theory that the horse can think or the assumption that tricks\r\nhave been employed.\r\n\r\nAnd now, aside from the specific results obtained, what is the\r\nscientific and philosophic import of the whole affair?--For one thing,\r\nthe revolution in our conception of the animal mind, which had been\r\nhoped for by some, and feared by others, has not taken place. But a\r\nconclusion of an opposite character is justified. If such unexampled\r\npatience and high pedagogical excellence as was daily brought to bear by\r\nMr. von Osten during the course of four long years, could not bring to\r\nlight the slightest trace of conceptual thinking, then the old assertion\r\nof the philosophers that the lower forms are incapable of such thinking,\r\nfinds corroboration in the results of these experiments so far as the\r\nanimal scale up to and including the ungulates is concerned. For this\r\nreason the tremendous effort put forth by Mr. von Osten, is not, in\r\nspite of the self-deception under which he labors, lost to science. If\r\nanyone has the courage to try the experiment with the dog or the ape,\r\nthe insight which we have now gained will enable him to beware of one\r\nsource of error which hitherto has not been noticed.\r\n\r\nIn the face of much misapprehension which has arisen, I wish once more\r\nto say emphatically that the committee of September 12th in no wise\r\ndeclared itself to be convinced that the horse had the power of rational\r\nthinking. The committee restricted itself entirely to the question\r\nwhether or not tricks were involved, and, intentionally and rightly\r\nreferred the positive investigation to a purely scientific court. I\r\nwould also report that for some time Mr. Schillings has been convinced,\r\nby his own observations, of the horse's lack of reason, and when he was\r\napprised of our conclusion in the matter, he embraced it without\r\nwavering. I have no intention of taking part in any discussion which may\r\narise in the press as a result of the present report. Unless they wish\r\nto confine themselves to mere guesswork, the defenders of other views\r\nwill not shrink from the task of basing their criticism upon careful\r\nmethodical experimentation, and they will keep a detailed record of\r\ntheir results day by day; for statements based solely upon memory,\r\nwithout specific report of experimental conditions, prove nothing.\r\n\r\nPROF.
