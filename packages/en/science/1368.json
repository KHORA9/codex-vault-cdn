RIDER HAGGARD.\r\n\r\nTo\r\nThe Earl Curzon of Kedleston, K.G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN THE WORLD SHOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nArbuthnot Describes Himself\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose that I, Humphrey Arbuthnot, should begin this history in\r\nwhich Destiny has caused me to play so prominent a part, with some\r\nshort account of myself and of my circumstances.\r\n\r\nI was born forty years ago in this very Devonshire village in which I\r\nwrite, but not in the same house. Now I live in the Priory, an ancient\r\nplace and a fine one in its way, with its panelled rooms, its beautiful\r\ngardens where, in this mild climate, in addition to our own, flourish\r\nso many plants which one would only expect to find in countries that\r\nlie nearer to the sun, and its green, undulating park studded with\r\ngreat timber trees. The view, too, is perfect; behind and around the\r\nrich Devonshire landscape with its hills and valleys and its scarped\r\nfaces of red sandstone, and at a distance in front, the sea. There are\r\nlittle towns quite near too, that live for the most part on visitors,\r\nbut these are so hidden away by the contours of the ground that from\r\nthe Priory one cannot see them. Such is Fulcombe where I live, though\r\nfor obvious reasons I do not give it its real name.\r\n\r\nMany years ago my father, the Rev. Humphrey Arbuthnot, whose only child\r\nI am, after whom also I am named Humphrey, was the vicar of this place\r\nwith which our family is said to have some rather vague hereditary\r\nconnection. If so, it was severed in the Carolian times because my\r\nancestors fought on the side of Parliament.\r\n\r\nMy father was a recluse, and a widower, for my mother, a Scotswoman,\r\ndied at or shortly after my birth. Being very High Church for those\r\ndays he was not popular with the family that owned the Priory before\r\nme. Indeed its head, a somewhat vulgar person of the name of Enfield\r\nwho had made money in trade, almost persecuted him, as he was in a\r\nposition to do, being the local magnate and the owner of the rectorial\r\ntithes.\r\n\r\nI mention this fact because owing to it as a boy I made up my mind that\r\none day I would buy that place and sit in his seat, a wild enough idea\r\nat the time. Yet it became engrained in me, as do such aspirations of\r\nour youth, and when the opportunity arose in after years I carried it\r\nout. Poor old Enfield! He fell on evil fortunes, for in trying to\r\nbolster up a favourite son who was a gambler, a spendthrift, and an\r\nungrateful scamp, in the end he was practically ruined and when the bad\r\ntimes came, was forced to sell the Fulcombe estate. I think of him\r\nkindly now, for after all he was good to me and gave me many a day’s\r\nshooting and leave to fish for trout in the river.\r\n\r\nBy the poor people, however, of all the district round, for the parish\r\nitself is very small, my father was much beloved, although he did\r\npractise confession, wear vestments and set lighted candles on the\r\naltar, and was even said to have openly expressed the wish, to which\r\nhowever he never attained, that he could see a censer swinging in the\r\nchancel. Indeed the church which, as monks built it, is very large and\r\nfine, was always full on Sundays, though many of the worshippers came\r\nfrom far away, some of them doubtless out of curiosity because of its\r\npapistical repute, also because, in a learned fashion, my father’s\r\npreaching was very good indeed.\r\n\r\nFor my part I feel that I owe much to these High-Church views. They\r\nopened certain doors to me and taught me something of the mysteries\r\nwhich lie at the back of all religions and therefore have their home in\r\nthe inspired soul of man whence religions are born. Only the pity is\r\nthat in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred he never discovers, never\r\neven guesses at that entombed aspiration, never sinks a shaft down on\r\nto this secret but most precious vein of ore.\r\n\r\nI have said that my father was learned; but this is a mild description,\r\nfor never did I know anyone quite so learned. He was one of those men\r\nwho is so good all round that he became pre-eminent in nothing. A\r\nclassic of the first water, a very respectable mathematician, an expert\r\nin theology, a student of sundry foreign languages and literature in\r\nhis lighter moments, an inquirer into sociology, a theoretical musician\r\nthough his playing of the organ excruciated most people because it was\r\ntoo correct, a really first-class authority upon flint instruments and\r\nthe best grower of garden vegetables in the county, also of apples—such\r\nwere some of his attainments. That was what made his sermons so\r\npopular, since at times one or the other of these subjects would break\r\nout into them, his theory being that God spoke to us through all of\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\nBut if I began to drift into an analysis of my father’s abilities, I\r\nshould never stop. It would take a book to describe them. And yet mark\r\nthis, with them all his name is as dead to the world to-day as though\r\nhe had never been. Light reflected from a hundred facets dissipates\r\nitself in space and is lost; that concentrated in one tremendous ray\r\npierces to the stars.\r\n\r\nNow I am going to be frank about myself, for without frankness what is\r\nthe value of such a record as this? Then it becomes simply another\r\nconvention, or rather conventional method of expressing the octoroon\r\nkind of truths with which the highly civilised races feed themselves,\r\nas fastidious ladies eat cakes and bread from which all but the\r\nsmallest particle of nourishment has been extracted.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, therefore, that I inherited most of my father’s abilities,\r\nexcept his love for flint instruments which always bored me to\r\ndistraction, because although they are by association really the most\r\nhuman of things, somehow to me they never convey any idea of humanity.\r\nIn addition I have a practical side which he lacked; had he possessed\r\nit surely he must have become an archbishop instead of dying the vicar\r\nof an unknown parish. Also I have a spiritual sense, mayhap mystical\r\nwould be a better term, which with all this religion was missing from\r\nmy father’s nature.\r\n\r\nFor I think that notwithstanding his charity and devotion he never\r\nquite got away from the shell of things, never cracked it and set his\r\nteeth in the kernel which alone can feed our souls. His keen intellect,\r\nto take an example, recognised every one of the difficulties of our\r\nfaith and flashed hither and thither in the darkness, seeking\r\nexplanation, seeking light, trying to reconcile, to explain. He was not\r\ngreat enough to put all this aside and go straight to the informing\r\nSoul beneath that strives to express itself everywhere, even through\r\nthose husks which are called the World, the Flesh and the Devil, and as\r\nyet does not always quite succeed.\r\n\r\nIt is this boggling over exteriors, this peering into pitfalls, this\r\ndesire to prove that what such senses as we have tell us is impossible,\r\nis in fact possible, which causes the overthrow of many an earnest,\r\nseeking heart and renders its work, conducted on false lines, quite\r\nnugatory. These _will_ trust to themselves and their own intelligence\r\nand not be content to spring from the cliffs of human experience into\r\nthe everlasting arms of that Infinite which are stretched out to\r\nreceive them and to give them rest and the keys of knowledge. When will\r\nman learn what was taught to him of old, that faith is the only plank\r\nwherewith he can float upon this sea and that his miserable works avail\r\nhim nothing; also that it is a plank made of many sorts of wood,\r\nperhaps to suit our different weights?\r\n\r\nSo to be honest, in a sense I believe myself to be my father’s\r\nsuperior, and I know that he agreed with me. Perhaps this is owing to\r\nthe blood of my Scotch mother which mixed well with his own; perhaps\r\nbecause the essential spirit given to me, though cast in his mould, was\r\nin fact quite different—or of another alloy. Do we, I wonder, really\r\nunderstand that there are millions and billions of these alloys, so\r\nmany indeed that Nature, or whatever is behind Nature, never uses the\r\nsame twice over? That is why no two human beings are or ever will be\r\nquite identical. Their flesh, the body of their humiliation, is\r\nidentical in all, any chemist will prove it to you, but that which\r\nanimates the flesh is distinct and different because it comes from the\r\nhome of that infinite variety which is necessary to the ultimate\r\nevolution of the good and bad that we symbolise as heaven and hell.\r\n\r\nFurther, I had and to a certain extent still have another advantage\r\nover my father, which certainly came to me from my mother, who was, as\r\nI judge from all descriptions and such likenesses as remain of her, an\r\nextremely handsome woman. I was born much better looking. He was small\r\nand dark, a little man with deep-set eyes and beetling brows. I am also\r\ndark, but tall above the average, and well made. I do not know that I\r\nneed say more about my personal appearance, to me not a very attractive\r\nsubject, but the fact remains that they called me “handsome Humphrey”\r\nat the University, and I was the captain of my college boat and won\r\nmany prizes at athletic sports when I had time to train for them.\r\n\r\nUntil I went up to Oxford my father educated me, partly because he knew\r\nthat he could do it better than anyone else, and partly to save school\r\nexpenses. The experiment was very successful, as my love of all outdoor\r\nsports and of any small hazardous adventure that came to my hand, also\r\nof associating with fisherfolk whom the dangers of the deep make men\r\namong men, saved me from becoming a milksop. For the rest I learned\r\nmore from my father, whom I always desired to please because I loved\r\nhim, than I should have done at the best and most costly of schools.\r\nThis was shown when at last I went to college with a scholarship, for\r\nthere I did very well indeed, as search would still reveal.\r\n\r\nHere I had better set out some of my shortcomings, which in their sum\r\nhave made a failure of me. Yes, a failure in the highest sense, though\r\nI trust what Stevenson calls “a faithful failure.” These have their\r\nroot in fastidiousness and that lack of perseverance, which really\r\nmeans a lack of faith, again using the word in its higher and wider\r\nsense. For if one had real faith one would always persevere, knowing\r\nthat in every work undertaken with high aim, there is an element of\r\nnobility, however humble and unrecognised that work may seem to be. God\r\nafter all is the God of Work, it is written large upon the face of the\r\nUniverse. I will not expand upon the thought; it would lead me too far\r\nafield, but those who have understanding will know what I mean.\r\n\r\nAs regards what I interpret as fastidiousness, this is not very easy to\r\nexpress. Perhaps a definition will help. I am like a man with an\r\nover-developed sense of smell, who when walking through a foreign city,\r\nhowever clean and well kept, can always catch the evil savours that are\r\ninseparable from such cities. More, his keen perception of them\r\ninterferes with all other perceptions and spoils his walks. The result\r\nis that in after years, whenever he thinks of that beautiful city, he\r\nremembers, not its historic buildings or its wide boulevards, or\r\nwhatever it has to boast, but rather its ancient, fish-like smell. At\r\nleast he remembers that first owing to this defect in his temperament.\r\n\r\nSo it is with everything. A lovely woman is spoiled for such a one\r\nbecause she eats too much or has too high a voice; he does not care for\r\nhis shooting because the scenery is flat, or for his fishing because\r\nthe gnats bite as well as the trout. In short he is out of tune with\r\nthe world as it is. Moreover, this is a quality which, where it exists,\r\ncannot be overcome; it affects day-labourers as well as gentlemen at\r\nlarge. It is bred in the bone.\r\n\r\nProbably the second failure-breeding fault, lack of perseverance, has\r\nits roots in the first, at any rate in my case. At least on leaving\r\ncollege with some reputation, I was called to the Bar where, owing to\r\ncertain solicitor and other connections, I had a good opening. Also,\r\nowing to the excellence of my memory and powers of work, I began very\r\nwell, making money even during my first year. Then, as it happened, a\r\ncertain case came my way and, my leader falling ill suddenly after it\r\nwas opened, was left in my hands. The man whose cause I was pleading\r\nwas, I think, one of the biggest scoundrels it is possible to conceive.\r\nIt was a will case and if he won, the effect would be to beggar two\r\nmost estimable middle-aged women who were justly entitled to the\r\nproperty, to which end personally I am convinced he had committed\r\nforgery; the perjury that accompanied it I do not even mention.\r\n\r\nWell, he did win, thanks to me, and the estimable middle-aged ladies\r\nwere beggared, and as I heard afterwards, driven to such extremities\r\nthat one of them died of her misery and the other became a\r\nlodging-house keeper. The details do not matter, but I may explain that\r\nthese ladies were unattractive in appearance and manner and broke down\r\nbeneath my cross-examination which made them appear to be telling\r\nfalsehoods, whereas they were only completely confused. Further, I\r\ninvented an ingenious theory of the facts which, although the judge\r\nregarded it with suspicion, convinced an unusually stupid jury who gave\r\nme their verdict.\r\n\r\nEverybody congratulated me and at the time I was triumphant, especially\r\nas my leader had declared that our case was impossible. Afterwards,\r\nhowever, my conscience smote me sorely, so much so that arguing from\r\nthe false premise of this business, I came to the conclusion that the\r\npractice of the Law was not suited to an honest man. I did not take the\r\nlarge view that such matters average themselves up and that if I had\r\ndone harm in this instance, I might live to do good in many others, and\r\nperhaps become a just judge, even a great judge. Here I may mention\r\nthat in after years, when I grew rich, I rescued that surviving old\r\nlady from her lodging-house, although to this day she does not know the\r\nname of her anonymous friend. So by degrees, without saying anything,\r\nfor I kept on my chambers, I slipped out of practice, to the great\r\ndisappointment of everybody connected with me, and took to authorship.\r\n\r\nA marvel came to pass, my first book was an enormous success. The whole\r\nworld talked of it. A leading journal, delighted to have discovered\r\nsomeone, wrote it up; other journals followed suit to be in the\r\nmovement. One of them, I remember, which had already dismissed it with\r\nthree or four sneering lines, came out with a second and two-column\r\nnotice. It sold like wildfire and I suppose had some merits, for it is\r\nstill read, though few know that I wrote it, since fortunately it was\r\npublished under a pseudonym.\r\n\r\nAgain I was much elated and set to work to write another and, as I\r\nbelieve, a much better book. But jealousies had been excited by this\r\nleaping into fame of a totally unknown person, which were, moreover,\r\naccentuated through a foolish article that I published in answer to\r\nsome criticisms, wherein I spoke my mind with an insane freedom and\r\nbiting sarcasm. Indeed I was even mad enough to quote names and to give\r\nthe example of the very powerful journal which at first carped at my\r\nwork and then gushed over it when it became the fashion. All of this\r\nmade me many bitter enemies, as I found out when my next book appeared.\r\n\r\nIt was torn to shreds, it was reviled as subversive of morality and\r\nreligion, good arrows in those days. It was called puerile,\r\nhalf-educated stuff—I half-educated! More, an utterly false charge of\r\nplagiarism was cooked up against me and so well and venomously run that\r\nvast numbers of people concluded that I was a thief of the lowest\r\norder. Lastly, my father, from whom the secret could no longer be kept,\r\nsternly disapproved of both these books which I admit were written from\r\na very radical and somewhat anti-church point of view. The result was\r\nour first quarrel and before it was made up, he died suddenly.\r\n\r\nNow again fastidiousness and my lack of perseverance did their work,\r\nand solemnly I swore that I would never write another book, an oath\r\nwhich I have kept till this moment, at least so far as publication is\r\nconcerned, and now break only because I consider it my duty so to do\r\nand am not animated by any pecuniary object.\r\n\r\nThus came to an end my second attempt at carving out a career. By now I\r\nhad grown savage and cynical, rather revengeful also, I fear. Knowing\r\nmyself to possess considerable abilities in sundry directions, I sat\r\ndown, as it were, to think things over and digest my past experiences.\r\nThen it was that the truth of a very ancient adage struck upon my mind,\r\nnamely, that money is power. Had I sufficient money I could laugh at\r\nunjust critics for example; indeed they or their papers would scarcely\r\ndare to criticise me for fear lest it should be in my power to do them\r\na bad turn. Again I could follow my own ideas in life and perhaps work\r\ngood in the world, and live in such surroundings as commended\r\nthemselves to me. It was as clear as daylight, but—how to make the\r\nmoney?\r\n\r\nI had some capital as the result of my father’s death, about £8,000 in\r\nall, plus a little more that my two books had brought in. In what way\r\ncould I employ it to the best advantage? I remembered that a cousin of\r\nmy father and therefore my own, was a successful stock-broker, also\r\nthat there had been some affection between them. I went to him, he was\r\na good, easy-natured man who was frankly glad to see me, and offered to\r\nput £5,000 into his business, for I was not minded to risk every thing\r\nI had, if he would give me a share in the profits. He laughed heartily\r\nat my audacity.\r\n\r\n“Why, my boy,” he said, “being totally inexperienced at this game, you\r\nmight lose us more than that in a month. But I like your courage, I\r\nlike your courage, and the truth is that I do want help. I will think\r\nit over and write to you.”\r\n\r\nHe thought it over and in the end offered to try me for a year at a\r\nfixed salary with a promise of some kind of a partnership if I suited\r\nhim. Meanwhile my £5,000 remained in my pocket.\r\n\r\nI accepted, not without reluctance since with the impatience of youth I\r\nwanted everything at once. I worked hard in that office and soon\r\nmastered the business, for my knowledge of figures—I had taken a\r\nfirst-class mathematical degree at college—came to my aid, as in a way\r\ndid my acquaintance with Law and Literature. Moreover I had a certain\r\naptitude for what is called high finance. Further, Fortune, as usual,\r\nshowed me a favourable face.\r\n\r\nIn one year I got the partnership with a small share in the large\r\nprofits of the business. In two the partner above me retired, and I\r\ntook his place with a third share of the firm. In three my cousin,\r\nsatisfied that it was in able hands, began to cease his attendance at\r\nthe office and betook himself to gardening which was his hobby. In four\r\nI paid him out altogether, although to do this I had to borrow money on\r\nour credit, for by agreement the title of the firm was continued. Then\r\ncame that extraordinary time of boom which many will remember to their\r\ncost. I made a bold stroke and won. On a certain Saturday when the\r\nbooks were made up, I found that after discharging all liabilities, I\r\nshould not be worth more than £20,000. On the following Saturday but\r\ntwo when the books were made up, I was worth £153,000! _L’appétit vient\r\nen mangeant_. It seemed nothing to me when so many were worth millions.\r\n\r\nFor the next year I worked as few have done, and when I struck a\r\nbalance at the end of it, I found that on the most conservative\r\nestimate I was the owner of a million and a half in hard cash, or its\r\nequivalent. I was so tired out that I remember this discovery did not\r\nexcite me at all. I felt utterly weary of all wealth-hunting and of the\r\nCity and its ways. Moreover my old fastidiousness and lack of\r\nperseverance re-asserted themselves. I reflected, rather late in the\r\nday perhaps, on the ruin that this speculation was bringing to\r\nthousands, of which some lamentable instances had recently come to my\r\nnotice, and once more considered whether it were a suitable career for\r\nan upright man. I had wealth; why should I not take it and enjoy life?\r\n\r\nAlso—and here my business acumen came in, I was sure that these times\r\ncould not last. It is easy to make money on a rising market, but when\r\nit is falling the matter is very different. In five minutes I made up\r\nmy mind. I sent for my junior partners, for I had taken in two, and\r\ntold them that I intended to retire at once. They were dismayed both at\r\nmy loss, for really I was the firm, and because, as they pointed out,\r\nif I withdrew all my capital, there would not be sufficient left to\r\nenable them to carry on.\r\n\r\nOne of them, a blunt and honest man, said to my face that it would be\r\ndishonourable of me to do so. I was inclined to answer him sharply,\r\nthen remembered that his words were true.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I said, “I will leave you £600,000 on which you shall pay\r\nme five per cent interest, but no share of the profits.”\r\n\r\nOn these terms we dissolved the partnership and in a year they had lost\r\nthe £600,000, for the slump came with a vengeance. It saved them,\r\nhowever, and to-day they are earning a reasonable income. But I have\r\nnever asked them for that £600,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nBastin and Bickley\r\n\r\n\r\nBehold me once more a man without an occupation, but now the possessor\r\nof about £900,000. It was a very considerable fortune, if not a large\r\none in England; nothing like the millions of which I had dreamed, but\r\nstill enough. To make the most of it and to be sure that it remained, I\r\ninvested it very well, mostly in large mortgages at four per cent\r\nwhich, if the security is good, do not depreciate in capital value.\r\nNever again did I touch a single speculative stock, who desired to\r\nthink no more about money. It was at this time that I bought the\r\nFulcombe property. It cost me about £120,000 of my capital, or with\r\nalterations, repairs, etc., say £150,000, on which sum it may pay a net\r\ntwo and a half per cent, not more.\r\n\r\nThis £3,700 odd I have always devoted to the upkeep of the place, which\r\nis therefore in first-rate order. The rest I live on, or save.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements, with the beautifying and furnishing of the house\r\nand the restoration of the church in memory of my father, occupied and\r\namused me for a year or so, but when they were finished time began to\r\nhang heavy on my hands. What was the use of possessing about £20,000 a\r\nyear when there was nothing upon which it could be spent? For after all\r\nmy own wants were few and simple and the acquisition of valuable\r\npictures and costly furniture is limited by space. Oh! in my small way\r\nI was like the weary King Ecclesiast. For I too made me great works and\r\nhad possessions of great and small cattle (I tried farming and lost\r\nmoney over it!) and gathered me silver and gold and the peculiar\r\ntreasure of kings, which I presume means whatever a man in authority\r\nchiefly desires, and so forth. But “behold all was vanity and vexation\r\nof spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.”\r\n\r\nSo, notwithstanding my wealth and health and the deference which is the\r\nrich man’s portion, especially when the limit of his riches is not\r\nknown, it came about that I too “hated life,” and this when I was not\r\nmuch over thirty. I did not know what to do; for Society as the word is\r\ngenerally understood, I had no taste; it bored me; horse-racing and\r\ncards I loathed, who had already gambled too much on a big scale. The\r\nkilling of creatures under the name of sport palled upon me, indeed I\r\nbegan to doubt if it were right, while the office of a junior county\r\nmagistrate in a place where there was no crime, only occupied me an\r\nhour or two a month.\r\n\r\nLastly my neighbours were few and with all due deference to them,\r\nextremely dull. At least I could not understand them because in them\r\nthere did not seem to be anything to understand, and I am quite certain\r\nthat they did not understand me. More, when they came to learn that I\r\nwas radical in my views and had written certain “dreadful” and somewhat\r\nsocialistic books in the form of fiction, they both feared and\r\nmistrusted me as an enemy to their particular section of the race. As I\r\nhad not married and showed no inclination to do so, their womenkind\r\nalso, out of their intimate knowledge, proclaimed that I led an immoral\r\nlife, though a little reflection would have shown them that there was\r\nno one in the neighbourhood which for a time I seldom left, who could\r\npossibly have tempted an educated creature to such courses.\r\n\r\nTerrible is the lot of a man who, while still young and possessing the\r\nintellect necessary to achievement, is deprived of all ambition. And I\r\nhad none at all. I did not even wish to purchase a peerage or a\r\nbaronetcy in this fashion or in that, and, as in my father’s case, my\r\ntastes were so many and so catholic that I could not lose myself in any\r\none of them. They never became more than diversions to me. A hobby is\r\nonly really amusing when it becomes an obsession.\r\n\r\nAt length my lonesome friendlessness oppressed me so much that I took\r\nsteps to mitigate it. In my college life I had two particular friends\r\nwhom I think I must have selected because they were so absolutely\r\ndifferent from myself.\r\n\r\nThey were named Bastin and Bickley. Bastin—Basil was his Christian\r\nname—was an uncouth, shock-headed, flat-footed person of large, rugged\r\nframe and equally rugged honesty, with a mind almost incredibly simple.\r\nNothing surprised him because he lacked the faculty of surprise. He was\r\nlike that kind of fish which lies at the bottom of the sea and takes\r\nevery kind of food into its great maw without distinguishing its\r\nflavour. Metaphorically speaking, heavenly manna and decayed cabbage\r\nwere just the same to Bastin. He was not fastidious and both were\r\nmental pabulum—of a sort—together with whatever lay between these\r\nextremes. Yet he was good, so painfully good that one felt that without\r\nexertion to himself he had booked a first-class ticket straight to\r\nHeaven; indeed that his guardian angel had tied it round his neck at\r\nbirth lest he should lose it, already numbered and dated like an\r\nidentification disc.\r\n\r\nI am bound to add that Bastin never went wrong because he never felt\r\nthe slightest temptation to do so. This I suppose constitutes real\r\nvirtue, since, in view of certain Bible sayings, the person who is\r\ntempted and would like to yield to the temptation, is equally a sinner\r\nwith the person who does yield. To be truly good one should be too good\r\nto be tempted, or too weak to make the effort worth the tempter’s\r\nwhile—in short not deserving of his powder and shot.\r\n\r\nI need hardly add that Bastin went into the Church; indeed, he could\r\nnot have gone anywhere else; it absorbed him naturally, as doubtless\r\nHeaven will do in due course. Only I think it likely that until they\r\nget to know him he will bore the angels so much that they will\r\ncontinually move him up higher. Also if they have any susceptibilities\r\nleft, probably he will tread upon their toes—an art in which I never\r\nknew his equal. However, I always loved Bastin, perhaps because no one\r\nelse did, a fact of which he remained totally unconscious, or perhaps\r\nbecause of his brutal way of telling one what he conceived to be the\r\ntruth, which, as he had less imagination than a dormouse, generally it\r\nwas not. For if the truth is a jewel, it is one coloured and veiled by\r\nmany different lights and atmospheres.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to add that he was learned in his theological fashion\r\nand that among his further peculiarities were the slow, monotonous\r\nvoice in which he uttered his views in long sentences, and his total\r\nindifference to adverse argument however sound and convincing.\r\n\r\nMy other friend, Bickley, was a person of a quite different character.\r\nLike Bastin, he was learned, but his tendencies faced another way. If\r\nBastin’s omnivorous throat could swallow a camel, especially a\r\ntheological camel, Bickley’s would strain at the smallest gnat,\r\nespecially a theological gnat. The very best and most upright of men,\r\nyet he believed in nothing that he could not taste, see or handle. He\r\nwas convinced, for instance, that man is a brute-descended accident and\r\nno more, that what we call the soul or the mind is produced by a\r\ncertain action of the grey matter of the brain; that everything\r\napparently inexplicable has a perfectly mundane explanation, if only\r\none could find it; that miracles certainly never did happen, and never\r\nwill; that all religions are the fruit of human hopes and fears and the\r\nmost convincing proof of human weakness; that notwithstanding our\r\ninfinite variations we are the subjects of Nature’s single law and the\r\nvictims of blind, black and brutal chance.\r\n\r\nSuch was Bickley with his clever, well-cut face that always reminded me\r\nof a cameo, and thoughtful brow; his strong, capable hands and his\r\nrather steely mouth, the mere set of which suggested controversy of an\r\nuncompromising kind. Naturally as the Church had claimed Bastin, so\r\nmedicine claimed Bickley.\r\n\r\nNow as it happened the man who succeeded my father as vicar of Fulcombe\r\nwas given a better living and went away shortly after I had purchased\r\nthe place and with it the advowson. Just at this time also I received a\r\nletter written in the large, sprawling hand of Bastin from whom I had\r\nnot heard for years. It went straight to the point, saying that he,\r\nBastin, had seen in a Church paper that the last incumbent had resigned\r\nthe living of Fulcombe which was in my gift. He would therefore be\r\nobliged if I would give it to him as the place he was at in Yorkshire\r\ndid not suit his wife’s health.\r\n\r\nHere I may state that afterwards I learned that what did not suit Mrs.\r\nBastin was the organist, who was pretty. She was by nature a woman with\r\na temperament so insanely jealous that actually she managed to be\r\nsuspicious of Bastin, whom she had captured in an unguarded moment when\r\nhe was thinking of something else and who would as soon have thought of\r\neven looking at any woman as he would of worshipping Baal. As a matter\r\nof fact it took him months to know one female from another. Except as\r\npossible providers of subscriptions and props of Mothers’ Meetings,\r\nwomen had no interest for him.\r\n\r\nTo return—with that engaging honesty which I have mentioned—Bastin’s\r\nletter went on to set out all his own disabilities, which, he added,\r\nwould probably render him unsuitable for the place he desired to fill.\r\nHe was a High Churchman, a fact which would certainly offend many; he\r\nhad no claims to being a preacher although he was extraordinarily well\r\nacquainted with the writings of the Early Fathers. (What on earth had\r\nthat to do with the question, I wondered.) On the other hand he had\r\ngenerally been considered a good visitor and was fond of walking (he\r\nmeant to call on distant parishioners, but did not say so).\r\n\r\nThen followed a page and a half on the evils of the existing system of\r\nthe presentation to livings by private persons, ending with the\r\nsuggestion that I had probably committed a sin in buying this\r\nparticular advowson in order to increase my local authority, that is,\r\nif I had bought it, a point on which he was ignorant. Finally he\r\ninformed me that as he had to christen a sick baby five miles away on a\r\ncertain moor and it was too wet for him to ride his bicycle, he must\r\nstop. And he stopped.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a P.S. to the letter, which ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“Someone told me that you were dead a few years ago, and of course it\r\nmay be another man of the same name who owns Fulcombe. If so, no doubt\r\nthe Post Office will send back this letter.”\r\n\r\nThat was his only allusion to my humble self in all those diffuse\r\npages. It was a long while since I had received an epistle which made\r\nme laugh so much, and of course I gave him the living by return of\r\npost, and even informed him that I would increase its stipend to a sum\r\nwhich I considered suitable to the position.\r\n\r\nAbout ten days later I received another letter from Bastin which, as a\r\nscrawl on the flap of the envelope informed me, he had carried for a\r\nweek in his pocket and forgotten to post. Except by inference it\r\nreturned no thanks for my intended benefits. What it did say, however,\r\nwas that he thought it wrong of me to have settled a matter of such\r\nspiritual importance in so great a hurry, though he had observed that\r\nrich men were nearly always selfish where their time was concerned.\r\nMoreover, he considered that I ought first to have made inquiries as to\r\nhis present character and attainments, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nTo this epistle I replied by telegraph to the effect that I should as\r\nsoon think of making inquiries about the character of an archangel, or\r\nthat of one of his High Church saints. This telegram, he told me\r\nafterwards, he considered unseemly and even ribald, especially as it\r\nhad given great offence to the postmaster, who was one of the sidesmen\r\nin his church.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that I appointed the Rev. Basil Bastin to the living\r\nof Fulcombe, feeling sure that he would provide me with endless\r\namusement and act as a moral tonic and discipline. Also I appreciated\r\nthe man’s blunt candour. In due course he arrived, and I confess that\r\nafter a few Sundays of experience I began to have doubts as to the\r\nwisdom of my choice, glad as I was to see him personally. His sermons\r\nat once bored me, and, when they did not send me to sleep, excited in\r\nme a desire for debate. How could he be so profoundly acquainted with\r\nmysteries before which the world had stood amazed for ages? Was there\r\nnothing too hot or too heavy in the spiritual way for him to dismiss in\r\na few blundering and casual words, as he might any ordinary incident of\r\nevery-day life, I wondered? Also his idea of High Church observances\r\nwas not mine, or, I imagine, that of anybody else. But I will not\r\nattempt to set it out.\r\n\r\nHis peculiarities, however, were easy to excuse and entirely swallowed\r\nup by the innate goodness of his nature which soon made him beloved of\r\neveryone in the place, for although he thought that probably most\r\nthings were sins, I never knew him to discover a sin which he\r\nconsidered to be beyond the reach of forgiveness. Bastin was indeed a\r\nmost charitable man and in his way wide-minded.\r\n\r\nThe person whom I could not tolerate, however, was his wife, who, to my\r\nfancy, more resembled a vessel, a very unattractive vessel, full of\r\nvinegar than a woman. Her name was Sarah and she was small, plain,\r\nflat, sandy-haired and odious, quite obsessed, moreover, with her\r\njealousies of the Rev. Basil, at whom it pleased her to suppose that\r\nevery woman in the countryside under fifty was throwing herself.\r\n\r\nHere I will confess that to the best of my ability I took care that\r\nthey did in outward seeming, that is, whenever she was present,\r\ninstructing them to sit aside with him in darkened corners, to present\r\nhim with flowers, and so forth. Several of them easily fell into the\r\nhumour of the thing, and I have seen him depart from a dinner-party\r\nfollowed by that glowering Sarah, with a handful of rosebuds and\r\nviolets, to say nothing of the traditional offerings of slippers,\r\nembroidered markers and the like. Well, it was my only way of coming\r\neven with her, which I think she knew, for she hated me poisonously.\r\n\r\nSo much for Basil Bastin. Now for Bickley. Him I had met on several\r\noccasions since our college days, and after I was settled at the Priory\r\nfrom time to time I asked him to stay with me. At length he came, and I\r\nfound out that he was not at all comfortable in his London practice\r\nwhich was of a nature uncongenial to him; further, that he did not get\r\non with his partners. Then, after reflection, I made a suggestion to\r\nhim. I pointed out that, owing to its popularity amongst seaside\r\nvisitors, the neighbourhood of Fulcombe was a rising one, and that\r\nalthough there were doctors in it, there was no really first-class\r\nsurgeon for miles.\r\n\r\nNow Bickley was a first-class surgeon, having held very high hospital\r\nappointments, and indeed still holding them. Why, I asked, should he\r\nnot come and set up here on his own? I would appoint him doctor to the\r\nestate and also give him charge of a cottage hospital which I was\r\nendowing, with liberty to build and arrange it as he liked. Further, as\r\nI considered that it would be of great advantage to me to have a man of\r\nreal ability within reach, I would guarantee for three years whatever\r\nincome he was earning in London.\r\n\r\nHe thanked me warmly and in the end acted on the idea, with startling\r\nresults so far as his prospects were concerned. Very soon his really\r\nremarkable skill became known and he was earning more money than as an\r\nunmarried man he could possibly want. Indeed, scarcely a big operation\r\ntook place at any town within twenty miles, and even much farther away,\r\nat which he was not called in to assist.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say his advent was a great boon to me, for as he lived in a\r\nhouse I let him quite near by, whenever he had a spare evening he would\r\ndrop in to dinner, and from our absolutely opposite standpoints we\r\ndiscussed all things human and divine. Thus I was enabled to sharpen my\r\nwits upon the hard steel of his clear intellect which was yet, in a\r\nsense, so limited.\r\n\r\nI must add that I never converted him to my way of thinking and he\r\nnever converted me to his, any more than he converted Bastin, for whom,\r\nqueerly enough, he had a liking. They pounded away at each other,\r\nBickley frequently getting the best of it in the argument, and when at\r\nlast Bastin rose to go, he generally made the same remark. It was:\r\n\r\n“It really is sad, my dear Bickley, to find a man of your intellect so\r\nutterly wrongheaded and misguided. I have convicted you of error at\r\nleast half a dozen times, and not to confess it is mere pigheadedness.\r\nGood night. I am sure that Sarah will be sitting up for me.”\r\n\r\n“Silly old idiot!” Bickley would say, shaking his fist after him. “The\r\nonly way to get him to see the truth would be to saw his head open and\r\npour it in.”\r\n\r\nThen we would both laugh.\r\n\r\nSuch were my two most intimate friends, although I admit it was rather\r\nlike the equator cultivating close relationships with the north and\r\nsouth poles. Certainly Bastin was as far from Bickley as those points\r\nof the earth are apart, while I, as it were, sat equally distant\r\nbetween the two. However, we were all very happy together, since in\r\ncertain characters, there are few things that bind men more closely\r\nthan profound differences of opinion.\r\n\r\nNow I must turn to my more personal affairs. After all, it is\r\nimpossible for a man to satisfy his soul, if he has anything of the\r\nsort about him which in the remotest degree answers to that\r\ndescription, with the husks of wealth, luxury and indolence,\r\nsupplemented by occasional theological and other arguments between his\r\nfriends. Becoming profoundly convinced of this truth, I searched round\r\nfor something to do and, like Noah’s dove on the waste of waters, found\r\nnothing. Then I asked Bickley and Bastin for their opinions as to my\r\nbest future course. Bickley proved a barren draw. He rubbed his nose\r\nand feebly suggested that I might go in for “research work,” which, of\r\ncourse, only represented his own ambitions. I asked him indignantly how\r\nI could do such a thing without any scientific qualifications whatever.\r\nHe admitted the difficulty, but replied that I might endow others who\r\nhad the qualifications.\r\n\r\n“In short, become a milch cow for sucking scientists,” I replied, and\r\nbroke off the conversation.\r\n\r\nBastin’s idea was, first, that I should teach in a Sunday School;\r\nsecondly, that if this career did not satisfy all my aspirations, I\r\nmight be ordained and become a missionary.\r\n\r\nOn my rejection of this brilliant advice, he remarked that the only\r\nother thing he could think of was that I should get married and have a\r\nlarge family, which might possibly advantage the nation and ultimately\r\nenrich the Kingdom of Heaven, though of such things no one could be\r\nquite sure. At any rate, he was certain that at present I was in\r\npractice neglecting my duty, whatever it might be, and in fact one of\r\nthose cumberers of the earth who, he observed in the newspaper he took\r\nin and read when he had time, were “very happily named—the idle rich.”\r\n\r\n“Which reminds me,” he added, “that the clothing-club finances are in a\r\nperfectly scandalous condition; in fact, it is £25 in debt, an amount\r\nthat as the squire of the parish I consider it incumbent on you to make\r\ngood, not as a charity but as an obligation.”\r\n\r\n“Look here, my friend,” I said, ignoring all the rest, “will you answer\r\nme a plain question? Have you found marriage such a success that you\r\nconsider it your duty to recommend it to others? And if you have, why\r\nhave _you_ not got the large family of which you speak?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not,” he replied with his usual frankness. “Indeed, it is in\r\nmany ways so disagreeable that I am convinced it must be right and for\r\nthe good of all concerned. As regards the family I am sure I do not\r\nknow, but Sarah never liked babies, which perhaps has something to do\r\nwith it.”\r\n\r\nThen he sighed, adding, “You see, Arbuthnot, we have to take things as\r\nwe find them in this world and hope for a better.”\r\n\r\n“Which is just what I am trying to do, you unilluminating old donkey!”\r\nI exclaimed, and left him there shaking his head over matters in\r\ngeneral, but I think principally over Sarah.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I think that the villagers recognised this good lady’s\r\nvinegary nature. At least, they used to call her “Sour Sal.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nNatalie\r\n\r\n\r\nNow what Bastin had said about marriage stuck in my mind as his\r\nblundering remarks had a way of doing, perhaps because of the grain of\r\nhonest truth with which they were often permeated. Probably in my\r\nposition it was more or less my duty to marry. But here came the rub; I\r\nhad never experienced any leanings that way. I was as much a man as\r\nothers, more so than many are, perhaps, and I liked women, but at the\r\nsame time they repelled me.\r\n\r\nMy old fastidiousness came in; to my taste there was always something\r\nwrong about them. While they attracted one part of my nature they\r\nrevolted another part, and on the whole I preferred to do without their\r\nintimate society, rather than work violence to this second and higher\r\npart of me. Moreover, quite at the beginning of my career I had\r\nconcluded from observation that a man gets on better in life alone,\r\nrather than with another to drag at his side, or by whom perhaps he\r\nmust be dragged. Still true marriage, such as most men and some women\r\nhave dreamed of in their youth, had always been one of my ideals;\r\nindeed it was on and around this vision that I wrote that first book of\r\nmine which was so successful. Since I knew this to be unattainable in\r\nour imperfect conditions, however, notwithstanding Bastin’s strictures,\r\nagain I dismissed the whole matter from my mind as a vain imagination.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative I reflected upon a parliamentary career which I was\r\nnot too old to begin, and even toyed with one or two opportunities that\r\noffered themselves, as these do to men of wealth and advanced views.\r\nThey never came to anything, for in the end I decided that Party\r\npolitics were so hateful and so dishonest, that I could not bring\r\nmyself to put my neck beneath their yoke. I was sure that if I tried to\r\ndo so, I should fail more completely than I had done at the Bar and in\r\nLiterature. Here, too, I am quite certain that I was right.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of it all was that I sought refuge in that last expedient of\r\nweary Englishmen, travel, not as a globe-trotter, but leisurely and\r\nwith an inquiring mind, learning much but again finding, like the\r\nancient writer whom I have quoted already, that there is no new thing\r\nunder the sun; that with certain variations it is the same thing over\r\nand over again.\r\n\r\nNo, I will make an exception, the East did interest me enormously.\r\nThere it was, at Benares, that I came into touch with certain thinkers\r\nwho opened my eyes to a great deal. They released some hidden spring in\r\nmy nature which hitherto had always been striving to break through the\r\ncrust of our conventions and inherited ideas. I know now that what I\r\nwas seeking was nothing less than the Infinite; that I had “immortal\r\nlongings in me.” I listened to all their solemn talk of epochs and\r\nyears measureless to man, and reflected with a thrill that after all\r\nman might have his part in every one of them. Yes, that bird of passage\r\nas he seemed to be, flying out of darkness into darkness, still he\r\nmight have spread his wings in the light of other suns millions upon\r\nmillions of years ago, and might still spread them, grown radiant and\r\nglorious, millions upon millions of years hence in a time unborn.\r\n\r\nIf only I could know the truth. Was Life (according to Bickley) merely\r\na short activity bounded by nothingness before and behind; or\r\n(according to Bastin) a conventional golden-harped and haloed\r\nimmortality, a word of which he did not in the least understand the\r\nmeaning?\r\n\r\nOr was it something quite different from either of these, something\r\nvast and splendid beyond the reach of vision, something God-sent,\r\nbeginning and ending in the Eternal Absolute and at last partaking of\r\nHis attributes and nature and from aeon to aeon shot through with His\r\nlight? And how was the truth to be learned? I asked my Eastern friends,\r\nand they talked vaguely of long ascetic preparation, of years upon\r\nyears of learning, from whom I could not quite discover. I was sure it\r\ncould not be from them, because clearly they did not know; they only\r\npassed on what they had heard elsewhere, when or how they either could\r\nnot or would not explain. So at length I gave it up, having satisfied\r\nmyself that all this was but an effort of Oriental imagination called\r\ninto life by the sweet influences of the Eastern stars.\r\n\r\nI gave it up and went away, thinking that I should forget. But I did\r\nnot forget. I was quick with a new hope, or at any rate with a new\r\naspiration, and that secret child of holy desire grew and grew within\r\nmy soul, till at length it flashed upon me that this soul of mine was\r\nitself the hidden Master from which I must learn my lesson. No wonder\r\nthat those Eastern friends could not give his name, seeing that\r\nwhatever they really knew, as distinguished from what they had heard,\r\nand it was little enough, each of them had learned from the teaching of\r\nhis own soul.\r\n\r\nThus, then, I too became a dreamer with only one longing, the longing\r\nfor wisdom, for that spirit touch which should open my eyes and enable\r\nme to see.\r\n\r\nYet now it happened strangely enough that when I seemed within myself\r\nto have little further interest in the things of the world, and least\r\nof all in women, I, who had taken another guest to dwell with me, those\r\nthings of the world came back to me and in the shape of Woman the\r\nInevitable. Probably it was so decreed since is it not written that no\r\nman can live to himself alone, or lose himself in watching and\r\nnurturing the growth of his own soul?\r\n\r\nIt happened thus. I went to Rome on my way home from India, and stayed\r\nthere a while. On the day after my arrival I wrote my name in the book\r\nof our Minister to Italy at that time, Sir Alfred Upton, not because I\r\nwished him to ask me to dinner, but for the reason that I had heard of\r\nhim as a man of archæological tastes and thought that he might enable\r\nme to see things which otherwise I should not see.\r\n\r\nAs it chanced he knew about me through some of my Devonshire neighbours\r\nwho were friends of his, and did ask me to dinner on the following\r\nnight. I accepted and found myself one of a considerable party, some of\r\nthem distinguished English people who wore Orders, as is customary when\r\none dines with the representative of our Sovereign. Seeing these, and\r\nthis shows that in the best of us vanity is only latent, for the first\r\ntime in my life I was sorry that I had none and was only plain Mr.\r\nArbuthnot who, as Sir Alfred explained to me politely, must go in to\r\ndinner last, because all the rest had titles, and without even a lady\r\nas there was not one to spare.\r\n\r\nNor was my lot bettered when I got there, as I found myself seated\r\nbetween an Italian countess and a Russian prince, neither of whom could\r\ntalk English, while, alas, I knew no foreign language, not even French\r\nin which they addressed me, seeming surprised that I did not understand\r\nthem. I was humiliated at my own ignorance, although in fact I was not\r\nignorant, only my education had been classical. Indeed I was a good\r\nclassic and had kept up my knowledge more or less, especially since I\r\nbecame an idle man. In my confusion it occurred to me that the Italian\r\ncountess might know Latin from which her own language was derived, and\r\naddressed her in that tongue. She stared, and Sir Alfred, who was not\r\nfar off and overheard me (he also knew Latin), burst into laughter and\r\nproceeded to explain the joke in a loud voice, first in French and then\r\nin English, to the assembled company, who all became infected with\r\nmerriment and also stared at me as a curiosity.\r\n\r\nThen it was that for the first time I saw Natalie, for owing to a\r\nmistake of my driver I had arrived rather late and had not been\r\nintroduced to her. As her father’s only daughter, her mother being\r\ndead, she was seated at the end of the table behind a fan-like\r\narrangement of white Madonna lilies, and she had bent forward and, like\r\nthe others, was looking at me, but in such a fashion that her head from\r\nthat distance seemed as though it were surrounded and crowned with\r\nlilies. Indeed the greatest art could not have produced a more\r\nbeautiful effect which was, however, really one of naked accident.\r\n\r\nAn angel looking down upon earth through the lilies of Heaven—that was\r\nthe rather absurd thought which flashed into my mind. I did not quite\r\nrealise her face at first except that it seemed to be both dark and\r\nfair; as a fact her waving hair which grew rather low upon her\r\nforehead, was dark, and her large, soft eyes were grey. I did not know,\r\nand to this moment I do not know if she was really beautiful, but\r\ncertainly the light that shone through those eyes of hers and seemed to\r\nbe reflected upon her delicate features, was beauty itself. It was like\r\nthat glowing through a thin vase of the purest alabaster within which a\r\nlamp is placed, and I felt this effect to arise from no chance, like\r\nthat of the lily-setting, but, as it were, from the lamp of the spirit\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nOur eyes met, and I suppose that she saw the wonder and admiration in\r\nmine. At any rate her amused smile faded, leaving the face rather\r\nserious, though still sweetly serious, and a tinge of colour crept over\r\nit as the first hue of dawn creeps into a pearly sky. Then she withdrew\r\nherself behind the screen of lilies and for the rest of that dinner\r\nwhich I thought was never coming to an end, practically I saw her no\r\nmore. Only I noted as she passed out that although not tall, she was\r\nrounded and graceful in shape and that her hands were peculiarly\r\ndelicate.\r\n\r\nAfterwards in the drawing-room her father, with whom I had talked at\r\nthe table, introduced me to her, saying:\r\n\r\n“My daughter is the real archaeologist, Mr. Arbuthnot, and I think if\r\nyou ask her, she may be able to help you.”\r\n\r\nThen he bustled away to speak to some of his important guests, from\r\nwhom I think he was seeking political information.\r\n\r\n“My father exaggerates,” she said in a soft and very sympathetic voice,\r\n“but perhaps”—and she motioned me to a seat at her side.\r\n\r\nThen we talked of the places and things that I more particularly\r\ndesired to see and, well, the end of it was that I went back to my\r\nhotel in love with Natalie; and as she afterwards confessed, she went\r\nto bed in love with me.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious business, more like meeting a very old friend from\r\nwhom one had been separated by circumstances for a score of years or so\r\nthan anything else. We were, so to speak, intimate from the first; we\r\nknew all about each other, although here and there was something new,\r\nsomething different which we could not remember, lines of thought,\r\nveins of memory which we did not possess in common. On one point I am\r\nabsolutely clear: it was not solely the everyday and ancient appeal of\r\nwoman to man and man to woman which drew us together, though doubtless\r\nthis had its part in our attachment as under our human conditions it\r\nmust do, seeing that it is Nature’s bait to ensure the continuance of\r\nthe race. It was something more, something quite beyond that elementary\r\nimpulse.\r\n\r\nAt any rate we loved, and one evening in the shelter of the solemn\r\nwalls of the great Coliseum at Rome, which at that hour were shut to\r\nall except ourselves, we confessed our love. I really think we must\r\nhave chosen the spot by tacit but mutual consent because we felt it to\r\nbe fitting. It was so old, so impregnated with every human experience,\r\nfrom the direst crime of the tyrant who thought himself a god, to the\r\nsublimest sacrifice of the martyr who already was half a god; with\r\nevery vice and virtue also which lies between these extremes, that it\r\nseemed to be the most fitting altar whereon to offer our hearts and all\r\nthat caused them to beat, each to the other.\r\n\r\nSo Natalie and I were betrothed within a month of our first meeting.\r\nWithin three we were married, for what was there to prevent or delay?\r\nNaturally Sir Alfred was delighted, seeing that he possessed but small\r\nprivate resources and I was able to make ample provision for his\r\ndaughter who had hitherto shown herself somewhat difficult in this\r\nbusiness of matrimony and now was bordering on her twenty-seventh year.\r\nEverybody was delighted, everything went smoothly as a sledge sliding\r\ndown a slope of frozen snow and the mists of time hid whatever might be\r\nat the end of that slope. Probably a plain; at the worst the upward\r\nrise of ordinary life.\r\n\r\nThat is what we thought, if we thought at all. Certainly we never\r\ndreamed of a precipice. Why should we, who were young, by comparison,\r\nquite healthy and very rich? Who thinks of precipices under such\r\ncircumstances, when disaster seems to be eliminated and death is yet a\r\nlong way off?\r\n\r\nAnd yet we ought to have done so, because we should have known that\r\nsmooth surfaces without impediment to the runners often end in\r\nsomething of the kind.\r\n\r\nI am bound to say that when we returned home to Fulcombe, where of\r\ncourse we met with a great reception, including the ringing (out of\r\ntune) of the new peal of bells that I had given to the church, Bastin\r\nmade haste to point this out.\r\n\r\n“Your wife seems a very nice and beautiful lady, Arbuthnot,” he\r\nreflected aloud after dinner, when Mrs. Bastin, glowering as usual,\r\nthough what at I do not know, had been escorted from the room by\r\nNatalie, “and really, when I come to think of it, you are an unusually\r\nfortunate person. You possess a great deal of money, much more than you\r\nhave any right to; which you seem to have done very little to earn and\r\ndo not spend quite as I should like you to do, and this nice property,\r\nthat ought to be owned by a great number of people, as, according to\r\nthe views you express, I should have thought you would acknowledge, and\r\neverything else that a man can want. It is very strange that you should\r\nbe so favoured and not because of any particular merits of your own\r\nwhich one can see. However, I have no doubt it will all come even in\r\nthe end and you will get your share of troubles, like others. Perhaps\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot will have no children as there is so much for them to\r\ntake. Or perhaps you will lose all your money and have to work for your\r\nliving, which might be good for you. Or,” he added, still thinking\r\naloud after his fashion, “perhaps she will die young—she has that kind\r\nof face, although, of course, I hope she won’t,” he added, waking up.\r\n\r\nI do not know why, but his wandering words struck me cold; the\r\nproverbial funeral bell at the marriage feast was nothing to them. I\r\nsuppose it was because in a flash of intuition I knew that they would\r\ncome true and that he was an appointed Cassandra. Perhaps this uncanny\r\nknowledge overcame my natural indignation at such super-_gaucherie_ of\r\nwhich no one but Bastin could have been capable, and even prevented me\r\nfrom replying at all, so that I merely sat still and looked at him.\r\n\r\nBut Bickley did reply with some vigour.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me for saying so, Bastin,” he said, bristling all over as it\r\nwere, “but your remarks, which may or may not be in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of your religion, seem to me to be in singularly bad taste.\r\nThey would have turned the stomachs of a gathering of early Christians,\r\nwho appear to have been the worst mannered people in the world, and at\r\nany decent heathen feast your neck would have been wrung as that of a\r\nbird of ill omen.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Bastin blankly. “I only said what I thought to be the\r\ntruth. The truth is better than what you call good taste.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will say what I think also to be the truth,” replied Bickley,\r\ngrowing furious. “It is that you use your Christianity as a cloak for\r\nbad manners. It teaches consideration and sympathy for others of which\r\nyou seem to have none. Moreover, since you talk of the death of\r\npeople’s wives, I will tell you something about your own, as a doctor,\r\nwhich I can do as I never attended her. It is highly probable, in my\r\nopinion, that she will die before Mrs. Arbuthnot, who is quite a\r\nhealthy person with a good prospect of life.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said Bastin. “If so, it will be God’s will and I shall not\r\ncomplain” (here Bickley snorted), “though I do not see what you can\r\nknow about it. But why should you cast reflections on the early\r\nChristians who were people of strong principle living in rough times,\r\nand had to wage war against an established devil-worship? I know you\r\nare angry because they smashed up the statues of Venus and so forth,\r\nbut had I been in their place I should have done the same.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you would, who doubts it? But as for the early Christians\r\nand their iconoclastic performances—well, curse them, that’s all!” and\r\nhe sprang up and left the room.\r\n\r\nI followed him.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed from the above scene that there was any\r\nill-feeling between Bastin and Bickley. On the contrary they were much\r\nattached to each other, and this kind of quarrel meant no more than the\r\nstrong expression of their individual views to which they were\r\naccustomed from their college days. For instance Bastin was always\r\ntalking about the early Christians and missionaries, while Bickley\r\nloathed both, the early Christians because of the destruction which\r\nthey had wrought in Egypt, Italy, Greece and elsewhere, of all that was\r\nbeautiful; and the missionaries because, as he said, they were\r\ndegrading and spoiling the native races and by inducing them to wear\r\nclothes, rendering them liable to disease. Bastin would answer that\r\ntheir souls were more important than their bodies, to which Bickley\r\nreplied that as there was no such thing as a soul except in the stupid\r\nimagination of priests, he differed entirely on the point. As it was\r\nquite impossible for either to convince the other, there the\r\nconversation would end, or drift into something in which they were\r\nmutually interested, such as natural history and the hygiene of the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nHere I may state that Bickley’s keen professional eye was not mistaken\r\nwhen he diagnosed Mrs. Bastin’s state of health as dangerous. As a\r\nmatter of fact she was suffering from heart disease that a doctor can\r\noften recognise by the colour of the lips, etc., which brought about\r\nher death under the following circumstances:\r\n\r\nHer husband attended some ecclesiastical function at a town over twenty\r\nmiles away and was to have returned by a train which would have brought\r\nhim home about five o’clock. As he did not arrive she waited at the\r\nstation for him until the last train came in about seven\r\no’clock—without the beloved Basil. Then, on a winter’s night she tore\r\nup to the Priory and begged me to lend her a dog-cart in which to drive\r\nto the said town to look for him. I expostulated against the folly of\r\nsuch a proceeding, saying that no doubt Basil was safe enough but had\r\nforgotten to telegraph, or thought that he would save the sixpence\r\nwhich the wire cost.\r\n\r\nThen it came out, to Natalie’s and my intense amusement, that all this\r\nwas the result of her jealous nature of which I have spoken. She said\r\nshe had never slept a night away from her husband since they were\r\nmarried and with so many “designing persons” about she could not say\r\nwhat might happen if she did so, especially as he was “such a favourite\r\nand so handsome.” (Bastin was a fine looking man in his rugged way.)\r\n\r\nI suggested that she might have a little confidence in him, to which\r\nshe replied darkly that she had no confidence in anybody.\r\n\r\nThe end of it was that I lent her the cart with a fast horse and a good\r\ndriver, and off she went. Reaching the town in question some two and a\r\nhalf hours later, she searched high and low through wind and sleet, but\r\nfound no Basil. He, it appeared, had gone on to Exeter, to look at the\r\ncathedral where some building was being done, and missing the last\r\ntrain had there slept the night.\r\n\r\nAbout one in the morning, after being nearly locked up as a mad woman,\r\nshe drove back to the Vicarage, again to find no Basil. Even then she\r\ndid not go to bed but raged about the house in her wet clothes, until\r\nshe fell down utterly exhausted. When her husband did return on the\r\nfollowing morning, full of information about the cathedral, she was\r\ndangerously ill, and actually passed away while uttering a violent\r\ntirade against him for his supposed suspicious proceedings.\r\n\r\nThat was the end of this truly odious British matron.\r\n\r\nIn after days Bastin, by some peculiar mental process, canonised her in\r\nhis imagination as a kind of saint. “So loving,” he would say, “such a\r\ndevoted wife! Why, my dear Humphrey, I can assure you that even in the\r\nmidst of her death-struggle her last thoughts were of me,” words that\r\ncaused Bickley to snort with more than usual vigour, until I kicked him\r\nto silence beneath the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nDeath and Departure\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I must tell of my own terrible sorrow, which turned my life to\r\nbitterness and my hopes to ashes.\r\n\r\nNever were a man and a woman happier together than I and Natalie.\r\nMentally, physically, spiritually we were perfectly mated, and we loved\r\neach other dearly. Truly we were as one. Yet there was something about\r\nher which filled me with vague fears, especially after she found that\r\nshe was to become a mother. I would talk to her of the child, but she\r\nwould sigh and shake her head, her eyes filling with tears, and say\r\nthat we must not count on the continuance of such happiness as ours,\r\nfor it was too great.\r\n\r\nI tried to laugh away her doubts, though whenever I did so I seemed to\r\nhear Bastin’s slow voice remarking casually that she might die, as he\r\nmight have commented on the quality of the claret. At last, however, I\r\ngrew terrified and asked her bluntly what she meant.\r\n\r\n“I don’t quite know, dearest,” she replied, “especially as I am\r\nwonderfully well. But—but—”\r\n\r\n“But what?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“But I think that our companionship is going to be broken for a little\r\nwhile.”\r\n\r\n“For a little while!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Humphrey. I think that I shall be taken away from you—you know\r\nwhat I mean,” and she nodded towards the churchyard.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my God!” I groaned.\r\n\r\n“I want to say this,” she added quickly, “that if such a thing should\r\nhappen, as it happens every day, I implore you, dearest Humphrey, not\r\nto be too much distressed, since I am sure that you will find me again.\r\nNo, I can’t explain how or when or where, because I do not know. I have\r\nprayed for light, but it has not come to me. All I know is that I am\r\nnot talking of reunion in Mr. Bastin’s kind of conventional heaven,\r\nwhich he speaks about as though to reach it one stumbled through\r\ndarkness for a minute into a fine new house next door, where excellent\r\nservants had made everything ready for your arrival and all the lights\r\nwere turned up. It is something quite different from that and very much\r\nmore real.”\r\n\r\nThen she bent down ostensibly to pat the head of a little black cocker\r\nspaniel called Tommy which had been given to her as a puppy, a highly\r\nintelligent and affectionate animal that we both adored and that loved\r\nher as only a dog can love. Really, I knew, it was to hide her tears,\r\nand fled from the room lest she should see mine.\r\n\r\nAs I went I heard the dog whimpering in a peculiar way, as though some\r\nsympathetic knowledge had been communicated to its wonderful animal\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nThat night I spoke to Bickley about the matter, repeating exactly what\r\nhad passed. As I expected, he smiled in his grave, rather sarcastic\r\nway, and made light of it.\r\n\r\n“My dear Humphrey,” he said, “don’t torment yourself about such\r\nfancies. They are of everyday occurrence among women in your wife’s\r\ncondition. Sometimes they take one form, sometimes another. When she\r\nhas got her baby you will hear no more of them.”\r\n\r\nI tried to be comforted but in vain.\r\n\r\nThe days and weeks went by like a long nightmare and in due course the\r\nevent happened. Bickley was not attending the case; it was not in his\r\nline, he said, and he preferred that where a friend’s wife was\r\nconcerned, somebody else should be called in. So it was put in charge\r\nof a very good local man with a large experience in such domestic\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nHow am I to tell of it? Everything went wrong; as for the details, let\r\nthem be. Ultimately Bickley did operate, and if surpassing skill could\r\nhave saved her, it would have been done. But the other man had\r\nmisjudged the conditions; it was too late, nothing could help either\r\nmother or child, a little girl who died shortly after she was born but\r\nnot before she had been christened, also by the name of Natalie.\r\n\r\nI was called in to say farewell to my wife and found her radiant,\r\ntriumphant even in her weakness.\r\n\r\n“I know now,” she whispered in a faint voice. “I understood as the\r\nchloroform passed away, but I cannot tell you. Everything is quite\r\nwell, my darling. Go where you seem called to go, far away. Oh! the\r\nwonderful place in which you will find me, not knowing that you have\r\nfound me. Good-bye for a little while; only for a little while, my own,\r\nmy own!”\r\n\r\nThen she died. And for a time I too seemed to die, but could not. I\r\nburied her and the child here at Fulcombe; or rather I buried their\r\nashes since I could not endure that her beloved body should see\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when all was over, I spoke of these last words of Natalie’s\r\nwith both Bickley and Bastin, for somehow I seemed to wish to learn\r\ntheir separate views.\r\n\r\nThe latter I may explain, had been present at the end in his spiritual\r\ncapacity, but I do not think that he in the least understood the nature\r\nof the drama which was passing before his eyes. His prayers and the\r\nchristening absorbed all his attention, and he never was a man who\r\ncould think of more than one thing at a time.\r\n\r\nWhen I told him exactly what had happened and repeated the words that\r\nNatalie spoke, he was much interested in his own nebulous way, and said\r\nthat it was delightful to meet with an example of a good Christian,\r\nsuch as my wife had been, who actually saw something of Heaven before\r\nshe had gone there. His own faith was, he thanked God, fairly robust,\r\nbut still an undoubted occurrence of the sort acted as a refreshment,\r\n“like rain on a pasture when it is rather dry, you know,” he added,\r\nbreaking into simile.\r\n\r\nI remarked that she had not seemed to speak in the sense he indicated,\r\nbut appeared to allude to something quite near at hand and more or less\r\nimmediate.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that there is anything nearer at hand than the\r\nHereafter,” he answered. “I expect she meant that you will probably\r\nsoon die and join her in Paradise, if you are worthy to do so. But of\r\ncourse it is not wise to put too much reliance upon words spoken by\r\npeople at the last, because often they don’t quite know what they are\r\nsaying. Indeed sometimes I think this was so in the case of my own\r\nwife, who really seemed to me to talk a good deal of rubbish. Good-bye,\r\nI promised to see Widow Jenkins this afternoon about having her\r\nvaricose veins cut out, and I mustn’t stop here wasting time in\r\npleasant conversation. She thinks just as much of her varicose veins as\r\nwe do of the loss of our wives.”\r\n\r\nI wonder what Bastin’s ideas of _unpleasant_ conversation may be,\r\nthought I to myself, as I watched him depart already wool-gathering on\r\nsome other subject, probably the heresy of one of those “early fathers”\r\nwho occupied most of his thoughts.\r\n\r\nBickley listened to my tale in sympathetic silence, as a doctor does to\r\na patient. When he was obliged to speak, he said that it was\r\ninteresting as an example of a tendency of certain minds towards\r\nromantic vision which sometimes asserts itself, even in the throes of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n“You know,” he added, “that I put faith in none of these things. I wish\r\nthat I could, but reason and science both show me that they lack\r\nfoundation. The world on the whole is a sad place, where we arrive\r\nthrough the passions of others implanted in them by Nature, which,\r\nalthough it cares nothing for individual death, is tender towards the\r\nimpulse of races of every sort to preserve their collective life.\r\nIndeed the impulse _is_ Nature, or at least its chief manifestation.\r\nConsequently, whether we be gnats or elephants, or anything between and\r\nbeyond, even stars for aught I know, we must make the best of things as\r\nthey are, taking the good and the evil as they come and getting all we\r\ncan out of life until it leaves us, after which we need not trouble.\r\nYou had a good time for a little while and were happy in it; now you\r\nare having a bad time and are wretched. Perhaps in the future, when\r\nyour mental balance has re-asserted itself, you will have other good\r\ntimes in the afternoon of your days, and then follow twilight and the\r\ndark. That is all there is to hope for, and we may as well look the\r\nthing in the face. Only I confess, my dear fellow, that your experience\r\nconvinces me that marriage should be avoided at whatever inconvenience.\r\nIndeed I have long wondered that anyone can take the responsibility of\r\nbringing a child into the world. But probably nobody does in cold\r\nblood, except misguided idiots like Bastin,” he added. “He would have\r\ntwenty, had not his luck intervened.”\r\n\r\n“Then you believe in nothing, Friend,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, I am sorry to say, except what I see and my five senses\r\nappreciate.”\r\n\r\n“You reject all possibility of miracle, for instance?”\r\n\r\n“That depends on what you mean by miracle. Science shows us all kinds\r\nof wonders which our great grandfathers would have called miracles, but\r\nthese are nothing but laws that we are beginning to understand. Give me\r\nan instance.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I replied at hazard, “if you were assured by someone that a man\r\ncould live for a thousand years?”\r\n\r\n“I should tell him that he was a fool or a liar, that is all. It is\r\nimpossible.”\r\n\r\n“Or that the same identity, spirit, animating principle—call it what\r\nyou will—can flit from body to body, say in successive ages? Or that\r\nthe dead can communicate with the living?”\r\n\r\n“Convince me of any of these things, Arbuthnot, and mind you I desire\r\nto be convinced, and I will take back every word I have said and walk\r\nthrough Fulcombe in a white sheet proclaiming myself the fool. Now, I\r\nmust get off to the Cottage Hospital to cut out Widow Jenkins’s\r\nvaricose veins. They are tangible and real at any rate; about the\r\nlargest I ever saw, indeed. Give up dreams, old boy, and take to\r\nsomething useful. You might go back to your fiction writing; you seem\r\nto have leanings that way, and you know you need not publish the\r\nstories, except privately for the edification of your friends.”\r\n\r\nWith this Parthian shaft Bickley took his departure to make a job of\r\nWidow Jenkins’s legs.\r\n\r\nI took his advice. During the next few months I did write something\r\nwhich occupied my thoughts for a while, more or less. It lies in my\r\nsafe to this minute, for somehow I have never been able to make up my\r\nmind to burn what cost me so much physical and mental toil.\r\n\r\nWhen it was finished my melancholy returned to me with added force.\r\nEverything in the house took a tongue and cried to me of past days. Its\r\nwalls echoed a voice that I could never hear again; in the very\r\nlooking-glasses I saw the reflection of a lost presence. Although I had\r\nmoved myself for the purposes of sleep to a little room at the further\r\nend of the building, footsteps seemed to creep about my bed at night\r\nand I heard the rustle of a remembered dress without the door. The\r\nplace grew hateful to me. I felt that I must get away from it or I\r\nshould go mad.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Bastin arrived carrying a book and in a state of high\r\nindignation. This work, written, as he said, by some ribald traveller,\r\ngrossly traduced the character of missionaries to the South Sea\r\nIslands, especially of those of the Society to which he subscribed, and\r\nhe threw it on the table in his righteous wrath. Bickley picked it up\r\nand opened it at a photograph of a very pretty South Sea Island girl\r\nclad in a few flowers and nothing else, which he held towards Bastin,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n“Is it to this child of Nature that you object? I call her distinctly\r\nattractive, though perhaps she does wear her hibiscus blooms with a\r\ndifference to our women—a little lower down.”\r\n\r\n“The devil is always attractive,” replied Bastin gloomily. “Child of\r\nNature indeed! I call her Child of Sin. That photograph is enough to\r\nmake my poor Sarah turn in her grave.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Bickley; “seeing that wide seas roll between you and this\r\ndusky Venus. Also I thought that according to your Hebrew legend sin\r\ncame in with bark garments.”\r\n\r\n“You should search the Scriptures, Bickley,” I broke in, “and cultivate\r\naccuracy. It was fig-leaves that symbolised its arrival. The garments,\r\nwhich I think were of skin, developed later.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” went on Bickley, who had turned the page, “she” (he referred\r\nto the late Mrs. Bastin) “would have preferred her thus,” and he held\r\nup another illustration of the same woman.\r\n\r\nIn this the native belle appeared after conversion, clad in broken-down\r\nstays—I suppose they were stays—out of which she seemed to bulge and\r\nflow in every direction, a dirty white dress several sizes too small, a\r\nkind of Salvation Army bonnet without a crown and a prayer-book which\r\nshe held pressed to her middle; the general effect being hideous, and\r\nin some curious way, improper.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Bastin, “though I admit her clothes do not seem to\r\nfit and she has not buttoned them up as she ought. But it is not of the\r\npictures so much as of the letterpress with its false and scandalous\r\naccusations, that I complain.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you complain?” asked Bickley. “Probably it is quite true,\r\nthough that we could never ascertain without visiting the lady’s home.”\r\n\r\n“If I could afford it,” exclaimed Bastin with rising anger, “I should\r\nlike to go there and expose this vile traducer of my cloth.”\r\n\r\n“So should I,” answered Bickley, “and expose these introducers of\r\nconsumption, measles and other European diseases, to say nothing of\r\ngin, among an innocent and Arcadian people.”\r\n\r\n“How can you call them innocent, Bickley, when they murder and eat\r\nmissionaries?”\r\n\r\n“I dare say we should all eat a missionary, Bastin, if we were hungry\r\nenough,” was the answer, after which something occurred to change the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nBut I kept the book and read it as a neutral observer, and came to the\r\nconclusion that these South Sea Islands, a land where it was always\r\nafternoon, must be a charming place, in which perhaps the stars of the\r\nTropics and the scent of the flowers might enable one to forget a\r\nlittle, or at least take the edge off memory. Why should I not visit\r\nthem and escape another long and dreary English winter? No, I could not\r\ndo so alone. If Bastin and Bickley were there, their eternal arguments\r\nmight amuse me. Well, why should they not come also? When one has money\r\nthings can always be arranged.\r\n\r\nThe idea, which had its root in this absurd conversation, took a\r\ncurious hold on me. I thought of it all the evening, being alone, and\r\nthat night it re-arose in my dreams. I dreamed that my lost Natalie\r\nappeared to me and showed me a picture. It was of a long, low land, a\r\ncurving shore of which the ends were out of the picture, whereon grew\r\ntall palms, and where great combers broke upon gleaming sand.\r\n\r\nThen the picture seemed to become a reality and I saw Natalie herself,\r\nstrangely changeful in her aspect, strangely varying in face and\r\nfigure, strangely bright, standing in the mouth of a pass whereof the\r\nlittle bordering cliffs were covered with bushes and low trees, whose\r\ngreen was almost hid in lovely flowers. There in my dream she stood,\r\nsmiling mysteriously, and stretched out her arms towards me.\r\n\r\nAs I awoke I seemed to hear her voice, repeating her dying words: “Go\r\nwhere you seem called to go, far away. Oh! the wonderful place in which\r\nyou will find me, not knowing that you have found me.”\r\n\r\nWith some variations this dream visited me twice that night. In the\r\nmorning I woke up quite determined that I would go to the South Sea\r\nIslands, even if I must do so alone. On that same evening Bastin and\r\nBickley dined with me. I said nothing to them about my dream, for\r\nBastin never dreamed and Bickley would have set it down to indigestion.\r\nBut when the cloth had been cleared away and we were drinking our glass\r\nof port—both Bastin and Bickley only took one, the former because he\r\nconsidered port a sinful indulgence of the flesh, the latter because he\r\nfeared it would give him gout—I remarked casually that they both looked\r\nvery run down and as though they wanted a rest. They agreed, at least\r\neach of them said he had noticed it in the other. Indeed Bastin added\r\nthat the damp and the cold in the church, in which he held daily\r\nservices to no congregation except the old woman who cleaned it, had\r\ngiven him rheumatism, which prevented him from sleeping.\r\n\r\n“Do call things by their proper names,” interrupted Bickley. “I told\r\nyou yesterday that what you are suffering from is neuritis in your\r\nright arm, which will become chronic if you neglect it much longer. I\r\nhave the same thing myself, so I ought to know, and unless I can stop\r\noperating for a while I believe my fingers will become useless. Also\r\nsomething is affecting my sight, overstrain, I suppose, so that I am\r\nobliged to wear stronger and stronger glasses. I think I shall have to\r\nleave Ogden” (his partner) “in charge for a while, and get away into\r\nthe sun. There is none here before June.”\r\n\r\n“I would if I could pay a _locum tenens_ and were quite sure it isn’t\r\nwrong,” said Bastin.\r\n\r\n“I am glad you both think like that,” I remarked, “as I have a\r\nsuggestion to make to you. I want to go to the South Seas about which\r\nwe were talking yesterday, to get the thorough change that Bickley has\r\nbeen advising for me, and I should be very grateful if you would both\r\ncome as my guests. You, Bickley, make so much money out of cutting\r\npeople about, that you can arrange your own affairs during your\r\nabsence. But as for you, Bastin, I will see to the wherewithal for the\r\n_locum tenens_, and everything else.”\r\n\r\n“You are very kind,” said Bastin, “and certainly I should like to\r\nexpose that misguided author, who probably published his offensive work\r\nwithout thinking that what he wrote might affect the subscriptions to\r\nthe missionary societies, also to show Bickley that he is not always\r\nright, as he seems to think. But I could never dream of accepting\r\nwithout the full approval of the Bishop.”\r\n\r\n“You might get that of your nurse also, if she happens to be still\r\nalive,” mocked Bickley. “As for his Lordship, I don’t think he will\r\nraise any objection when he sees the certificate I will give you about\r\nthe state of your health. He is a great believer in me ever since I\r\ntook that carbuncle out of his neck which he got because he will not\r\neat enough. As for me, I mean to come if only to show you how\r\ncontinually and persistently you are wrong. But, Arbuthnot, how do you\r\nmean to go?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. In a mail steamer, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“If you can run to it, a yacht would be much better.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a good idea, for one could get out of the beaten tracks and see\r\nthe places that are never, or seldom, visited. I will make some\r\ninquiries. And now, to celebrate the occasion, let us all have another\r\nglass of port and drink a toast.”\r\n\r\nThey hesitated and were lost, Bastin murmuring something about doing\r\nwithout his stout next day as a penance. Then they both asked what was\r\nthe toast, each of them, after thought, suggesting that it should be\r\nthe utter confusion of the other.\r\n\r\nI shook my head, whereon as a result of further cogitation, Bastin\r\nsubmitted that the Unknown would be suitable. Bickley said that he\r\nthought this a foolish idea as everything worth knowing was already\r\nknown, and what was the good of drinking to the rest? A toast to the\r\nTruth would be better.\r\n\r\nA notion came to me.\r\n\r\n“Let us combine them,” I said, “and drink to the Unknown Truth.”\r\n\r\nSo we did, though Bastin grumbled that the performance made him feel\r\nlike Pilate.\r\n\r\n“We are all Pilates in our way,” I replied with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“That is what I think every time I diagnose a case,” exclaimed Bickley.\r\n\r\nAs for me I laughed and for some unknown reason felt happier than I had\r\ndone for months. Oh! if only the writer of that tourist tale of the\r\nSouth Sea Islands could have guessed what fruit his light-thrown seed\r\nwould yield to us and to the world!\r\n\r\nI made my inquiries through a London agency which hired out yachts or\r\nsold them to the idle rich. As I expected, there were plenty to be had,\r\nat a price, but wealthy as I was, the figure asked of the buyer of any\r\nsuitable craft, staggered me. In the end, however, I chartered one for\r\nsix months certain and at so much per month for as long as I liked\r\nafterwards. The owners paid insurance and everything else on condition\r\nthat they appointed the captain and first mate, also the engineer, for\r\nthis yacht, which was named _Star of the South_, could steam at about\r\nten knots as well as sail.\r\n\r\nI know nothing about yachts, and therefore shall not attempt to\r\ndescribe her, further than to say that she was of five hundred and\r\nfifty tons burden, very well constructed, and smart to look at, as well\r\nshe might be, seeing that a deceased millionaire from whose executors I\r\nhired her had spent a fortune in building and equipping her in the best\r\npossible style. In all, her crew consisted of thirty-two hands. A\r\npeculiarity of the vessel was that owing to some fancy of the late\r\nowner, the passenger accommodation, which was splendid, lay forward of\r\nthe bridge, this with the ship’s store-rooms, refrigerating chamber,\r\netc., being almost in the bows. It was owing to these arrangements,\r\nwhich were unusual, that the executors found it impossible to sell, and\r\nwere therefore glad to accept such an offer as mine in order to save\r\nexpenses. Perhaps they hoped that she might go to the bottom, being\r\nheavily insured. If so, the Fates did not disappoint them.\r\n\r\nThe captain, named Astley, was a jovial person who held every kind of\r\ncertificate. He seemed so extraordinarily able at his business that\r\npersonally I suspected him of having made mistakes in the course of his\r\ncareer, not unconnected with the worship of Bacchus. In this I believe\r\nI was right; otherwise a man of such attainments would have been\r\ncommanding something bigger than a private yacht. The first mate,\r\nJacobsen, was a melancholy Dane, a spiritualist who played the\r\nconcertina, and seemed to be able to do without sleep. The crew were a\r\nmixed lot, good men for the most part and quite unobjectionable, more\r\nthan half of them being Scandinavian. I think that is all I need say\r\nabout the _Star of the South_.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement was that the _Star of the South_ should proceed through\r\nthe Straits of Gibraltar to Marseilles, where we would join her, and\r\nthence travel via the Suez Canal, to Australia and on to the South\r\nSeas, returning home as our fancy or convenience might dictate.\r\n\r\nAll the first part of the plan we carried out to the letter. Of the\r\nremainder I say nothing at present.\r\n\r\n_Star of the South_ was amply provided with every kind of store. Among\r\nthem were medicines and surgical instruments, selected by Bickley, and\r\na case of Bibles and other religious works in sundry languages of the\r\nSouth Seas, selected by Bastin, whose bishop, when he understood the\r\npious objects of his journey, had rather encouraged than hindered his\r\ndeparture on sick leave, and a large number of novels, books of\r\nreference, etc., laid in by myself. She duly sailed from the Thames and\r\nreached Marseilles after a safe and easy passage, where all three of us\r\nboarded her.\r\n\r\nI forgot to add that she had another passenger, the little spaniel,\r\nTommy. I had intended to leave him behind, but while I was packing up\r\nhe followed me about with such evident understanding of my purpose that\r\nmy heart was touched. When I entered the motor to drive to the station\r\nhe escaped from the hands of the servant, whimpering, and took refuge\r\non my knee. After this I felt that Destiny intended him to be our\r\ncompanion. Moreover, was he not linked with my dead past, and, had I\r\nbut known it, with my living future also?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nThe Cyclone\r\n\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed our voyage exceedingly. In Egypt, a land I was glad to\r\nrevisit, we only stopped a week while the _Star of the South_, which we\r\nrejoined at Suez, coaled and went through the Canal. This, however,\r\ngave us time to spend a few days in Cairo, visit the Pyramids and\r\nSakkara which Bastin and Bickley had never seen before, and inspect the\r\ngreat Museum. The journey up the Nile was postponed until our return.\r\nIt was a pleasant break and gave Bickley, a most omnivorous reader who\r\nwas well acquainted with Egyptian history and theology, the opportunity\r\nof trying to prove to Bastin that Christianity was a mere development\r\nof the ancient Egyptian faith. The arguments that ensued may be\r\nimagined. It never seemed to occur to either of them that all faiths\r\nmay be and indeed probably are progressive; in short, different rays of\r\nlight thrown from the various facets of the same crystal, as in turn\r\nthese are shone upon by the sun of Truth.\r\n\r\nOur passage down the Red Sea was cool and agreeable. Thence we shaped\r\nour course for Ceylon. Here again we stopped a little while to run up\r\nto Kandy and to visit the ruined city of Anarajapura with its great\r\nBuddhist topes that once again gave rise to religious argument between\r\nmy two friends. Leaving Ceylon we struck across the Indian Ocean for\r\nPerth in Western Australia.\r\n\r\nIt was a long voyage, since to save our coal we made most of it under\r\ncanvas. However, we were not dull as Captain Astley was a good\r\ncompanion, and even out of the melancholy Dane, Jacobsen, we had\r\nentertainment. He insisted on holding seances in the cabin, at which\r\nthe usual phenomena occurred. The table twisted about, voices were\r\nheard and Jacobsen’s accordion wailed out tunes above our heads. These\r\nhappenings drove Bickley to a kind of madness, for here were events\r\nwhich he could not explain. He was convinced that someone was playing\r\ntricks upon him, and devised the most elaborate snares to detect the\r\nrogue, entirely without result.\r\n\r\nFirst he accused Jacobsen, who was very indignant, and then me, who\r\nlaughed. In the end Jacobsen and I left the “circle” and the cabin,\r\nwhich was locked behind us; only Bastin and Bickley remaining there in\r\nthe dark. Presently we heard sounds of altercation, and Bickley emerged\r\nlooking very red in the face, followed by Bastin, who was saying:\r\n\r\n“Can I help it if something pulled your nose and snatched off your\r\neyeglasses, which anyhow are quite useless to you when there is no\r\nlight? Again, is it possible for me, sitting on the other side of that\r\ntable, to have placed the concertina on your head and made it play the\r\nNational Anthem, a thing that I have not the slightest idea how to do?”\r\n\r\n“Please do not try to explain,” snapped Bickley. “I am perfectly aware\r\nthat you deceived me somehow, which no doubt you think a good joke.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow,” I interrupted, “is it possible to imagine old Basil\r\ndeceiving anyone?”\r\n\r\n“Why not,” snorted Bickley, “seeing that he deceives himself from one\r\nyear’s end to the other?”\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Bastin, “that this is an unholy business and that we\r\nare both deceived by the devil. I will have no more to do with it,” and\r\nhe departed to his cabin, probably to say some appropriate prayers.\r\n\r\nAfter this the seances were given up but Jacobsen produced an\r\ninstrument called a planchette and with difficulty persuaded Bickley to\r\ntry it, which he did after many precautions. The thing, a heart-shaped\r\npiece of wood mounted on wheels and with a pencil stuck at its narrow\r\nend, cantered about the sheet of paper on which it was placed, Bickley,\r\nwhose hands rested upon it, staring at the roof of the cabin. Then it\r\nbegan to scribble and after a while stopped still.\r\n\r\n“Will the Doctor look?” said Jacobsen. “Perhaps the spirits have told\r\nhim something.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! curse all this silly talk about spirits,” exclaimed Bickley, as he\r\narranged his eyeglasses and held up the paper to the light, for it was\r\nafter dinner.\r\n\r\nHe stared, then with an exclamation which I will not repeat, and a\r\nglance of savage suspicion at the poor Dane and the rest of us, threw\r\nit down and left the cabin. I picked it up and next moment was\r\nscreaming with laughter. There on the top of the sheet was a rough but\r\nentirely recognizable portrait of Bickley with the accordion on his\r\nhead, and underneath, written in a delicate, Italian female hand,\r\nabsolutely different from his own, were these words taken from one of\r\nSt. Paul’s Epistles—“Oppositions of science falsely so called.”\r\nUnderneath them again in a scrawling, schoolboy fist, very like\r\nBastin’s, was inscribed, “Tell us how this is done, you silly doctor,\r\nwho think yourself so clever.”\r\n\r\n“It seems that the devil really can quote Scripture,” was Bastin’s only\r\ncomment, while Jacobsen stared before him and smiled.\r\n\r\nBickley never alluded to the matter, but for days afterwards I saw him\r\nexperimenting with paper and chemicals, evidently trying to discover a\r\nform of invisible ink which would appear upon the application of the\r\nhand. As he never said anything about it, I fear that he failed.\r\n\r\nThis planchette business had a somewhat curious ending. A few nights\r\nlater Jacobsen was working it and asked me to put a question. To oblige\r\nhim I inquired on what day we should reach Fremantle, the port of\r\nPerth. It wrote an answer which, I may remark, subsequently proved to\r\nbe quite correct.\r\n\r\n“That is not a good question,” said Jacobsen, “since as a sailor I\r\nmight guess the reply. Try again, Mr. Arbuthnot.”\r\n\r\n“Will anything remarkable happen on our voyage to the South Seas?” I\r\ninquired casually.\r\n\r\nThe planchette hesitated a while then wrote rapidly and stopped.\r\nJacobsen took up the paper and began to read the answer aloud—“To A, B\r\nthe D, and B the C, the most remarkable things will happen that have\r\nhappened to men living in the world.”\r\n\r\n“That must mean me, Bickley the doctor and Bastin the clergyman,” I\r\nsaid, laughing.\r\n\r\nJacobsen paid no attention, for he was reading what followed. As he did\r\nso I saw his face turn white and his eyes begin to start from his head.\r\nThen suddenly he tore the paper in pieces which he thrust into his\r\npocket. Lifting his great fist he uttered some Danish oath and with a\r\nsingle blow smashed the planchette to fragments, after which he strode\r\naway, leaving me astonished and somewhat disturbed. When I met him the\r\nnext morning I asked him what was on the paper.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” he said quietly, “something I should not like you too-proper\r\nEnglish gentlemens to see. Something not nice. You understand. Those\r\nspirits not always good; they do that kind of thing sometimes. That’s\r\nwhy I broke up this planchette.”\r\n\r\nThen he began to talk of something else and there the matter ended.\r\n\r\nI should have said that, principally with a view to putting themselves\r\nin a position to confute each other, ever since we had started from\r\nMarseilles both Bastin and Bickley spent a number of hours each day in\r\nassiduous study of the language of the South Sea Islands. It became a\r\nkind of competition between them as to which could learn the most. Now\r\nBastin, although simple and even stupid in some ways, was a good\r\nscholar, and as I knew at college, had quite a faculty for acquiring\r\nlanguages in which he had taken high marks at examinations. Bickley,\r\ntoo, was an extraordinarily able person with an excellent memory,\r\nespecially when he was on his mettle. The result was that before we\r\never reached a South Sea island they had a good working knowledge of\r\nthe local tongues.\r\n\r\nAs it chanced, too, at Perth we picked up a Samoan and his wife who,\r\nunder some of the “white Australia” regulations, were not allowed to\r\nremain in the country and offered to work as servants in return for a\r\npassage to Apia where we proposed to call some time or other. With\r\nthese people Bastin and Bickley talked all day long till really they\r\nbecame fairly proficient in their soft and beautiful dialect. They\r\nwished me to learn also, but I said that with two such excellent\r\ninterpreters and the natives while they remained with us, it seemed\r\nquite unnecessary. Still, I picked up a good deal in a quiet way, as\r\nmuch as they did perhaps.\r\n\r\nAt length, travelling on and on as a voyager to the planet Mars might\r\ndo, we sighted the low shores of Australia and that same evening were\r\ntowed, for our coal was quite exhausted, to the wharf at Fremantle.\r\nHere we spent a few days exploring the beautiful town of Perth and its\r\nneighbourhood where it was very hot just then, and eating peaches and\r\ngrapes till we made ourselves ill, as a visitor often does who is\r\nunaware that fruit should not be taken in quantity in Australia while\r\nthe sun is high. Then we departed for Melbourne almost before our\r\narrival was generally known, since I did not wish to advertise our\r\npresence or the object of our journey.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the Great Australian Bight, of evil reputation, in the most\r\nperfect weather; indeed it might have been a mill pond, and after a\r\nshort stay at Melbourne, went on to Sydney, where we coaled again and\r\nlaid in supplies.\r\n\r\nThen our real journey began. The plan we laid out was to sail to Suva\r\nin Fiji, about 1,700 miles away, and after a stay there, on to Hawaii\r\nor the Sandwich Islands, stopping perhaps at the Phoenix Islands and\r\nthe Central Polynesian Sporades, such as Christmas and Fanning Isles.\r\nThen we proposed to turn south again through the Marshall Archipelago\r\nand the Caroline Islands, and so on to New Guinea and the Coral Sea.\r\nParticularly did we wish to visit Easter Island on account of its\r\nmarvelous sculptures that are supposed to be the relics of a\r\npre-historic race. In truth, however, we had no fixed plan except to go\r\nwherever circumstance and chance might take us. Chance, I may add, or\r\nsomething else, took full advantage of its opportunities.\r\n\r\nWe came to Suva in safety and spent a while in exploring the beautiful\r\nFiji Isles where both Bastin and Bickley made full inquiries about the\r\nwork of the missionaries, each of them drawing exactly opposite\r\nconclusions from the same set of admitted facts. Thence we steamed to\r\nSamoa and put our two natives ashore at Apia, where we procured some\r\ncoal. We did not stay long enough in these islands to investigate them,\r\nhowever, because persons of experience there assured us from certain\r\nfamiliar signs that one of the terrible hurricanes with which they are\r\nafflicted, was due to arrive shortly and that we should do well to put\r\nourselves beyond its reach. So having coaled and watered we departed in\r\na hurry.\r\n\r\nUp to this time I should state we had met with the most wonderful good\r\nfortune in the matter of weather, so good indeed that never on one\r\noccasion since we left Marseilles, had we been obliged to put the\r\nfiddles on the tables. With the superstition of a sailor Captain\r\nAstley, when I alluded to the matter, shook his head saying that\r\ndoubtless we should pay for it later on, since “luck never goes all the\r\nway” and cyclones were reported to be about.\r\n\r\nHere I must tell that after we were clear of Apia, it was discovered\r\nthat the Danish mate who was believed to be in his cabin unwell from\r\nsomething he had eaten, was missing. The question arose whether we\r\nshould put back to find him, as we supposed that he had made a trip\r\ninland and met with an accident, or been otherwise delayed. I was in\r\nfavour of doing so though the captain, thinking of the threatened\r\nhurricane, shook his head and said that Jacobsen was a queer fellow who\r\nmight just as well have gone overboard as anywhere else, if he thought\r\nhe heard “the spirits, of whom he was so fond,” calling him. While the\r\nmatter was still in suspense I happened to go into my own stateroom and\r\nthere, stuck in the looking-glass, saw an envelope in the Dane’s\r\nhandwriting addressed to myself. On opening it I found another sealed\r\nletter, unaddressed, also a note that ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“Honoured Sir,\r\n    “You will think very badly of me for leaving you, but the enclosed\r\n    which I implore you not to open until you have seen the last of the\r\n    _Star of the South_, will explain my reason and I hope clear my\r\n    reputation. I thank you again and again for all your kindness and\r\n    pray that the Spirits who rule the world may bless and preserve\r\n    you, also the Doctor and Mr. Bastin.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter, which left the fate of Jacobsen quite unsolved, for it\r\nmight mean either that he had deserted or drowned himself, I put away\r\nwith the enclosure in my pocket. Of course there was no obligation on\r\nme to refrain from opening the letter, but I shrank from doing so both\r\nfrom some kind of sense of honour and, to tell the truth, for fear of\r\nwhat it might contain. I felt that this would be disagreeable; also,\r\nalthough there was nothing to connect them together, I bethought me of\r\nthe scene when Jacobsen had smashed the planchette.\r\n\r\nOn my return to the deck I said nothing whatsoever about the discovery\r\nof the letter, but only remarked that on reflection I had changed my\r\nmind and agreed with the captain that it would be unwise to attempt to\r\nreturn in order to look for Jacobsen. So the boatswain, a capable\r\nindividual who had seen better days, was promoted to take his watches\r\nand we went on as before. How curiously things come about in the world!\r\nFor nautical reasons that were explained to me, but which I will not\r\ntrouble to set down, if indeed I could remember them, I believe that if\r\nwe had returned to Apia we should have missed the great gale and\r\nsubsequent cyclone, and with these much else. But it was not so fated.\r\n\r\nIt was on the fourth day, when we were roughly seven hundred miles or\r\nmore north of Samoa, that we met the edge of this gale about sundown.\r\nThe captain put on steam in the hope of pushing through it, but that\r\nnight we dined for the first time with the fiddles on, and by eleven\r\no’clock it was as much as one could do to stand in the cabin, while the\r\nwater was washing freely over the deck. Fortunately, however, the wind\r\nveered more aft of us, so that by putting about her head a little\r\n(seamen must forgive me if I talk of these matters as a landlubber) we\r\nran almost before the wind, though not quite in the direction that we\r\nwished to go.\r\n\r\nWhen the light came it was blowing very hard indeed, and the sky was\r\nutterly overcast, so that we got no glimpse of the sun, or of the stars\r\non the following night. Unfortunately, there was no moon visible;\r\nindeed, if there had been I do not suppose that it would have helped us\r\nbecause of the thick pall of clouds. For quite seventy-two hours we ran\r\non beneath bare poles before that gale. The little vessel behaved\r\nsplendidly, riding the seas like a duck, but I could see that Captain\r\nAstley was growing alarmed. When I said something complimentary to him\r\nabout the conduct of the _Star of the South_, he replied that she was\r\nforging ahead all right, but the question was—where to? He had been\r\nunable to take an observation of any sort since we left Samoa; both his\r\npatent logs had been carried away, so that now only the compass\r\nremained, and he had not the slightest idea where we were in that great\r\nocean studded with atolls and islands.\r\n\r\nI asked him whether we could not steam back to our proper course, but\r\nhe answered that to do so he would have to travel dead in the eye of\r\nthe gale, and he doubted whether the engines would stand it. Also there\r\nwas the question of coal to be considered. However, he had kept the\r\nfires going and would do what he could if the weather moderated.\r\n\r\nThat night during dinner which now consisted of tinned foods and whisky\r\nand water, for the seas had got to the galley fire, suddenly the gale\r\ndropped, whereat we rejoiced exceedingly. The captain came down into\r\nthe saloon very white and shaken, I thought, and I asked him to have a\r\nnip of whisky to warm him up, and to celebrate our good fortune in\r\nhaving run out of the wind. He took the bottle and, to my alarm, poured\r\nout a full half tumbler of spirit, which he swallowed undiluted in two\r\nor three gulps.\r\n\r\n“That’s better!” he said with a hoarse laugh. “But man, what is it you\r\nare saying about having run out of the wind? Look at the glass!”\r\n\r\n“We have,” said Bastin, “and it is wonderfully steady. About 29 degrees\r\nor a little over, which it has been for the last three days.”\r\n\r\nAgain Astley laughed in a mirthless fashion, as he answered:\r\n\r\n“Oh, that thing! That’s the passengers’ glass. I told the steward to\r\nput it out of gear so that you might not be frightened; it is an old\r\ntrick. Look at this,” and he produced one of the portable variety out\r\nof his pocket.\r\n\r\nWe looked, and it stood somewhere between 27 degrees and 28 degrees.\r\n\r\n“That’s the lowest glass I ever saw in the Polynesian or any other seas\r\nduring thirty years. It’s right, too, for I have tested it by three\r\nothers,” he said.\r\n\r\n“What does it mean?” I asked rather anxiously.\r\n\r\n“South Sea cyclone of the worst breed,” he replied. “That cursed Dane\r\nknew it was coming and that’s why he left the ship. Pray as you never\r\nprayed before,” and again he stretched out his hand towards the whisky\r\nbottle. But I stepped between him and it, shaking my head. Thereon he\r\nlaughed for the third time and left the cabin. Though I saw him once or\r\ntwice afterwards, these were really the last words of intelligible\r\nconversation that I ever had with Captain Astley.\r\n\r\n“It seems that we are in some danger,” said Bastin, in an unmoved kind\r\nof way. “I think that was a good idea of the captain’s, to put up a\r\npetition, I mean, but as Bickley will scarcely care to join in it I\r\nwill go into the cabin and do so myself.”\r\n\r\nBickley snorted, then said:\r\n\r\n“Confound that captain! Why did he play such a trick upon us about the\r\nbarometer? Humphrey, I believe he had been drinking.”\r\n\r\n“So do I,” I said, looking at the whisky bottle. “Otherwise, after\r\ntaking those precautions to keep us in the dark, he would not have let\r\non like that.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bickley, “he can’t get to the liquor, except through this\r\nsaloon, as it is locked up forward with the other stores.”\r\n\r\n“That’s nothing,” I replied, “as doubtless he has a supply of his own;\r\nrum, I expect. We must take our chance.”\r\n\r\nBickley nodded, and suggested that we should go on deck to see what was\r\nhappening. So we went. Not a breath of wind was stirring, and even the\r\nsea seemed to be settling down a little. At least, so we judged from\r\nthe motion, for we could not see either it or the sky; everything was\r\nas black as pitch. We heard the sailors, however, engaged in rigging\r\nguide ropes fore and aft, and battening down the hatches with extra\r\ntarpaulins by the light of lanterns. Also they were putting ropes round\r\nthe boats and doing something to the spars and topmasts.\r\n\r\nPresently Bastin joined us, having, I suppose, finished his devotions.\r\n\r\n“Really, it is quite pleasant here,” he said. “One never knows how\r\ndisagreeable so much wind is until it stops.”\r\n\r\nI lit my pipe, making no answer, and the match burned quite steadily\r\nthere in the open air.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” exclaimed Bickley, staring at something which now I saw\r\nfor the first time. It looked like a line of white approaching through\r\nthe gloom. With it came a hissing sound, and although there was still\r\nno wind, the rigging began to moan mysteriously like a thing in pain. A\r\nbig drop of water also fell from the sides into my pipe and put it out.\r\nThen one of the sailors cried in a hoarse voice:\r\n\r\n“Get down below, governors, unless you want to go out to sea!”\r\n\r\n“Why?” inquired Bastin.\r\n\r\n“Why? Becos the ‘urricane is coming, that’s all. Coming as though the\r\ndevil had kicked it out of ‘ell.”\r\n\r\nBastin seemed inclined to remonstrate at this sort of language, but we\r\npushed him down the companion and followed, propelling the spaniel\r\nTommy in front of us. Next moment I heard the sailors battening the\r\nhatch with hurried blows, and when this was done to their satisfaction,\r\nheard their feet also as they ran into shelter.\r\n\r\nAnother instant and we were all lying in a heap on the cabin floor with\r\npoor Tommy on top of us. The cyclone had struck the ship! Above the\r\nwash of water and the screaming of the gale we heard other mysterious\r\nsounds, which doubtless were caused by the yards hitting the seas, for\r\nthe yacht was lying on her side. I thought that all was over, but\r\npresently there came a rending, crashing noise. The masts, or one of\r\nthem, had gone, and by degrees we righted.\r\n\r\n“Near thing!” said Bickley. “Good heavens, what’s that?”\r\n\r\nI listened, for the electric light had temporarily gone out, owing, I\r\nsuppose, to the dynamo having stopped for a moment. A most unholy and\r\nhollow sound was rising from the cabin floor. It might have been caused\r\nby a bullock with its windpipe cut, trying to get its breath and\r\ngroaning. Then the light came on again and we saw Bastin lying at full\r\nlength on the carpet.\r\n\r\n“He’s broken his neck or something,” I said.\r\n\r\nBickley crept to him and having looked, sang out:\r\n\r\n“It’s all right! He’s only sea-sick. I thought it would come to that if\r\nhe drank so much tea.”\r\n\r\n“Sea-sick,” I said faintly—“sea-sick?”\r\n\r\n“That’s all,” said Bickley. “The nerves of the stomach acting on the\r\nbrain or vice-versa—that is, if Bastin has a brain,” he added sotto\r\nvoce.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” groaned the prostrate clergyman. “I wish that I were dead!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t trouble about that,” answered Bickley. “I expect you soon will\r\nbe. Here, drink some whisky, you donkey.”\r\n\r\nBastin sat up and obeyed, out of the bottle, for it was impossible to\r\npour anything into a glass, with results too dreadful to narrate.\r\n\r\n“I call that a dirty trick,” he said presently, in a feeble voice,\r\nglowering at Bickley.\r\n\r\n“I expect I shall have to play you a dirtier before long, for you are a\r\npretty bad case, old fellow.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact he had, for once Bastin had begun really we thought\r\nthat he was going to die. Somehow we got him into his cabin, which\r\nopened off the saloon, and as he could drink nothing more, Bickley\r\nmanaged to inject morphia or some other compound into him, which made\r\nhim insensible for a long while.\r\n\r\n“He must be in a poor way,” he said, “for the needle went more than a\r\nquarter of an inch into him, and he never cried out or stirred.\r\nCouldn’t help it in that rolling.”\r\n\r\nBut now I could hear the engines working, and I think that the bow of\r\nthe vessel was got head on to the seas, for instead of rolling we\r\npitched, or rather the ship stood first upon one end and then upon the\r\nother. This continued for a while until the first burst of the cyclone\r\nhad gone by. Then suddenly the engines stopped; I suppose that they had\r\nbroken down, but I never learned, and we seemed to veer about, nearly\r\nsinking in the process, and to run before the hurricane at terrific\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\n“I wonder where we are going to?” I said to Bickley. “To the land of\r\nsleep, Humphrey, I imagine,” he replied in a more gentle voice than I\r\nhad often heard him use, adding: “Good-bye, old boy, we have been real\r\nfriends, haven’t we, notwithstanding my peculiarities? I only wish that\r\nI could think that there was anything in Bastin’s views. But I can’t, I\r\ncan’t. It’s good night for us poor creatures!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nLand\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the electric light really went out. I had looked at my watch\r\njust before this happened and wound it up, which, Bickley remarked, was\r\nsuperfluous and a waste of energy. It then marked 3.20 in the morning.\r\nWe had wedged Bastin, who was now snoring comfortably, into his berth,\r\nwith pillows, and managed to tie a cord over him—no, it was a large\r\nbath towel, fixing one end of it to the little rack over his bed and\r\nthe other to its framework. As for ourselves, we lay down on the floor\r\nbetween the table legs, which, of course, were screwed, and the settee,\r\nprotecting ourselves as best we were able by help of the cushions,\r\netc., between two of which we thrust the terrified Tommy who had been\r\nsliding up and down the cabin floor. Thus we remained, expecting death\r\nevery moment till the light of day, a very dim light, struggling\r\nthrough a port-hole of which the iron cover had somehow been wrenched\r\noff. Or perhaps it was never shut, I do not remember.\r\n\r\nAbout this time there came a lull in the hellish, howling hurricane;\r\nthe fact being, I suppose, that we had reached the centre of the\r\ncyclone. I suggested that we should try to go on deck and see what was\r\nhappening. So we started, only to find the entrance to the companion so\r\nfaithfully secured that we could not by any means get out. We knocked\r\nand shouted, but no one answered. My belief is that at this time\r\neveryone on the yacht except ourselves had been washed away and\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\nThen we returned to the saloon, which, except for a little water\r\ntrickling about the floor, was marvelously dry, and, being hungry,\r\nretrieved some bits of food and biscuit from its corners and ate. At\r\nthis moment the cyclone began to blow again worse than ever, but it\r\nseemed to us, from another direction, and before it sped our poor\r\nderelict barque. It blew all day till for my part I grew utterly weary\r\nand even longed for the inevitable end. If my views were not quite\r\nthose of Bastin, certainly they were not those of Bickley. I had\r\nbelieved from my youth up that the individuality of man, the ego, so to\r\nspeak, does not die when life goes out of his poor body, and this faith\r\ndid not desert me then. Therefore, I wished to have it over and learn\r\nwhat there might be upon the other side.\r\n\r\nWe could not speak much because of the howling of the wind, but Bickley\r\ndid manage to shout to me something to the effect that his partners\r\nwould, in his opinion, make an end of their great practice within two\r\nyears, which, he added, was a pity. I nodded my head, not caring\r\ntwopence what happened to Bickley’s partners or their business, or to\r\nmy own property, or to anything else. When death is at hand most of us\r\ndo not think much of such things because then we realise how small they\r\nare. Indeed I was wondering whether within a few minutes or hours I\r\nshould or should not see Natalie again, and if this were the end to\r\nwhich she had seemed to beckon me in that dream.\r\n\r\nOn we sped, and on. About four in the afternoon we heard sounds from\r\nBastin’s cabin which faintly reminded me of some tune. I crept to the\r\ndoor and listened. Evidently he had awakened and was singing or trying\r\nto sing, for music was not one of his strong points, “For those in\r\nperil on the sea.” Devoutly did I wish that it might be heard.\r\nPresently it ceased, so I suppose he went to sleep again.\r\n\r\nThe darkness gathered once more. Then of a sudden something fearful\r\nhappened. There were stupendous noises of a kind I had never heard;\r\nthere were convulsions. It seemed to us that the ship was flung right\r\nup into the air a hundred feet or more.\r\n\r\n“Tidal wave, I expect,” shouted Bickley.\r\n\r\nAlmost as he spoke she came down with the most appalling crash on to\r\nsomething hard and nearly jarred the senses out of us. Next the saloon\r\nwas whirling round and round and yet being carried forward, and we felt\r\nair blowing upon us. Then our senses left us. As I clasped Tommy to my\r\nside, whimpering and licking my face, my last thought was that all was\r\nover, and that presently I should learn everything or nothing.\r\n\r\nI woke up feeling very bruised and sore and perceived that light was\r\nflowing into the saloon. The door was still shut, but it had been\r\nwrenched off its hinges, and that was where the light came in; also\r\nsome of the teak planks of the decking, jagged and splintered, were\r\nsticking up through the carpet. The table had broken from its\r\nfastenings and lay upon its side. Everything else was one confusion. I\r\nlooked at Bickley. Apparently he had not awakened. He was stretched out\r\nstill wedged in with his cushions and bleeding from a wound in his\r\nhead. I crept to him in terror and listened. He was not dead, for his\r\nbreathing was regular and natural. The whisky bottle which had been\r\ncorked was upon the floor unbroken and about a third full. I took a\r\ngood pull at the spirit; to me it tasted like nectar from the gods.\r\nThen I tried to force some down Bickley’s throat but could not, so I\r\npoured a little upon the cut on his head. The smart of it woke him in a\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\n“Where are we now?” he exclaimed. “You don’t mean to tell me that\r\nBastin is right after all and that we live again somewhere else? Oh! I\r\ncould never bear that ignominy.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about living somewhere else,” I said, “although my\r\nopinions on that matter differ from yours. But I do know that you and I\r\nare still on earth in what remains of the saloon of the _Star of the\r\nSouth_.”\r\n\r\n“Thank God for that! Let’s go and look for old Bastin,” said Bickley.\r\n“I do pray that he is all right also.”\r\n\r\n“It is most illogical of you, Bickley, and indeed wrong,” groaned a\r\ndeep voice from the other side of the cabin door, “to thank a God in\r\nWhom you do not believe, and to talk of praying for one of the worst\r\nand most inefficient of His servants when you have no faith in prayer.”\r\n\r\n“Got you there, my friend,” I said.\r\n\r\nBickley murmured something about force of habit, and looked smaller\r\nthan I had ever seen him do before.\r\n\r\nSomehow we forced that door open; it was not easy because it had\r\njammed. Within the cabin, hanging on either side of the bath towel\r\nwhich had stood the strain nobly, something like a damp garment over a\r\nlinen line, was Bastin most of whose bunk seemed to have disappeared.\r\nYes—Bastin, pale and dishevelled and looking shrunk, with his hair\r\ntouzled and his beard apparently growing all ways, but still Bastin\r\nalive, if very weak.\r\n\r\nBickley ran at him and made a cursory examination with his fingers.\r\n\r\n“Nothing broken,” he said triumphantly. “He’s all right.”\r\n\r\n“If _you_ had hung over a towel for many hours in most violent weather\r\nyou would not say that,” groaned Bastin. “My inside is a pulp. But\r\nperhaps you would be kind enough to untie me.”\r\n\r\n“Bosh!” said Bickley as he obeyed. “All you want is something to eat.\r\nMeanwhile, drink this,” and he handed him the remains of the whisky.\r\n\r\nBastin swallowed it every drop, murmuring something about taking a\r\nlittle wine for his stomach’s sake, “one of the Pauline injunctions,\r\nyou know,” after which he was much more cheerful. Then we hunted about\r\nand found some more of the biscuits and other food with which we filled\r\nourselves after a fashion.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what has happened,” said Bastin. “I suppose that, thanks to\r\nthe skill of the captain, we have after all reached the haven where we\r\nwould be.”\r\n\r\nHere he stopped, rubbed his eyes and looked towards the saloon door\r\nwhich, as I have said, had been wrenched off its hinges, but appeared\r\nto have opened wider than when I observed it last. Also Tommy, who was\r\nrecovering his spirits, uttered a series of low growls.\r\n\r\n“It is a most curious thing,” he went on, “and I suppose I must be\r\nsuffering from hallucinations, but I could swear that just now I saw\r\nlooking through that door the same improper young woman clothed in a\r\nfew flowers and nothing else, whose photograph in that abominable and\r\nlibellous book was indirectly the cause of our tempestuous voyage.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” replied Bickley. “Well, so long as she has not got on the\r\nbroken-down stays and the Salvation Army bonnet without a crown, which\r\nyou may remember she wore after she had fallen into the hands of your\r\nfraternity, I am sure _I_ do not mind. In fact I should be delighted to\r\nsee anything so pleasant.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment a distinct sound of female tittering arose from beyond\r\nthe door. Tommy barked and Bickley stepped towards it, but I called to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Look out! Where there are women there are sure to be men. Let us be\r\nready against accidents.”\r\n\r\nSo we armed ourselves with pistols, that is Bickley and I did, Bastin\r\nbeing fortified solely with a Bible.\r\n\r\nThen we advanced, a remarkable and dilapidated trio, and dragged the\r\ndoor wide. Instantly there was a scurry and we caught sight of women’s\r\nforms wearing only flowers, and but few of these, running over white\r\nsand towards groups of men armed with odd-looking clubs, some of which\r\nwere fashioned to the shapes of swords and spears. To make an\r\nimpression I fired two shots with my revolver into the air, whereupon\r\nboth men and women fled into groves of trees and vanished.\r\n\r\n“They don’t seem to be accustomed to white people,” said Bickley. “Is\r\nit possible that we have found a shore upon which no missionary has set\r\na foot?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” said Bastin, “seeing that unworthy as I am, then the\r\nopportunities for me would be very great.”\r\n\r\nWe stood still and looked about us. This was what we saw. All the after\r\npart of the ship from forward of the bridge had vanished utterly; there\r\nwas not a trace of it; she had as it were been cut in two. More, we\r\nwere some considerable distance from the sea which was still raging\r\nover a quarter of a mile away where great white combers struck upon a\r\nreef and spouted into the air. Behind us was a cliff, apparently of\r\nrock but covered with earth and vegetation, and against this cliff, in\r\nwhich the prow of the ship was buried, she, or what remained of her,\r\nhad come to anchor for the last time.\r\n\r\n“You see what has happened,” I said. “A great tidal wave has carried us\r\nup here and retreated.”\r\n\r\n“That’s it,” exclaimed Bickley. “Look at the debris,” and he pointed to\r\ntorn-up palms, bushes and seaweed piled into heaps which still ran salt\r\nwater; also to a number of dead fish that lay about among them, adding,\r\n“Well, we are saved anyhow.”\r\n\r\n“And yet there are people like you who say that there is no\r\nProvidence!” ejaculated Bastin.\r\n\r\n“I wonder what the views of Captain Astley and the crew are, or rather\r\nwere, upon that matter,” interrupted Bickley.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” answered Bastin, looking about him vaguely. “It is true\r\nthat I can’t see any of them, but if they are drowned no doubt it is\r\nbecause their period of usefulness in this world had ended.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s get down and look about us,” I remarked, being anxious to avoid\r\nfurther argument.\r\n\r\nSo we scrambled from the remnant of the ship, like Noah descending out\r\nof the ark, as Bastin said, on to the beach beneath, where Tommy rushed\r\nto and fro, gambolling for joy. Here we discovered a path which ran\r\ndiagonally up the side of a cliff which was nowhere more than fifty or\r\nsixty feet in height, and possibly had once formed the shore of this\r\nland, or perhaps that of a lake. Up this path we went, following the\r\ntracks of many human feet, and reaching the crest of the cliff, looked\r\nabout us, basking as we did so in the beautiful morning sun, for the\r\nsky was now clear of clouds and with that last awful effort, which\r\ndestroyed our ship, the cyclone had passed away.\r\n\r\nWe were standing on a plain down which ran a little stream of good\r\nwater whereof Tommy drank greedily, we following his example. To the\r\nright and left of this plain, further than we could see, stretched\r\nbushland over which towered many palms, rather ragged now because of\r\nthe lashing of the gale. Looking inland we perceived that the ground\r\nsloped gently downwards, ending at a distance of some miles in a large\r\nlake. Far out in this lake something like the top of a mountain of a\r\nbrown colour rose above the water, and on the edge of it was what from\r\nthat distance appeared to be a tumbled ruin.\r\n\r\n“This is all very interesting,” I said to Bickley. “What do you make of\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t quite know. At first sight I should say that we are standing\r\non the lip of a crater of some vast extinct volcano. Look how it curves\r\nto north and south and at the slope running down to the lake.”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“Lucky that the tidal wave did not get over the cliff,” I said. “If it\r\nhad the people here would have all been drowned out. I wonder where\r\nthey have gone?”\r\n\r\nAs I spoke Bastin pointed to the edge of the bush some hundreds of\r\nyards away, where we perceived brown figures slipping about among the\r\ntrees. I suggested that we should go back to the mouth of our path, so\r\nas to have a line of retreat open in case of necessity, and await\r\nevents. So we did and there stood still. By degrees the brown figures\r\nemerged on to the plain to the number of some hundreds, and we saw that\r\nthey were both male and female. The women were clothed in nothing\r\nexcept flowers and a little girdle; the men were all armed with wooden\r\nweapons and also wore a girdle but no flowers. The children, of whom\r\nthere were many, were quite naked.\r\n\r\nAmong these people we observed a tall person clothed in what seemed to\r\nbe a magnificent feather cloak, and, walking around and about him, a\r\nnumber of grotesque forms adorned with hideous masks and basket-like\r\nhead-dresses that were surmounted by plumes.\r\n\r\n“The king or chief and his priests or medicine-men! This is splendid,”\r\nsaid Bickley triumphantly.\r\n\r\nBastin also contemplated them with enthusiasm as raw material upon\r\nwhich he hoped to get to work.\r\n\r\nBy degrees and very cautiously they approached us. To our joy, we\r\nperceived that behind them walked several young women who bore wooden\r\ntrays of food or fruit.\r\n\r\n“That looks well,” I said. “They would not make offerings unless they\r\nwere friendly.”\r\n\r\n“The food may be poisoned,” remarked Bickley suspiciously.\r\n\r\nThe crowd advanced, we standing quite still looking as dignified as we\r\ncould, I as the tallest in the middle, with Tommy sitting at my feet.\r\nWhen they were about five and twenty yards away, however, that wretched\r\nlittle dog caught sight of the masked priests. He growled and then\r\nrushed at them barking, his long black ears flapping as he went.\r\n\r\nThe effect was instantaneous. One and all they turned and fled\r\nprecipitately, who evidently had never before seen a dog and looked\r\nupon it as a deadly creature. Yes, even the tall chief and his masked\r\nmedicine-men fled like hares pursued by Tommy, who bit one of them in\r\nthe leg, evoking a terrific howl. I called him back and took him into\r\nmy arms. Seeing that he was safe for a while the crowd reformed and\r\nonce again advanced.\r\n\r\nAs they came we noted that they were a wonderfully handsome people,\r\ntall and straight with regularly shaped features and nothing of the\r\nnegro about them. Some of the young women might even be called\r\nbeautiful, though those who were elderly had become corpulent. The\r\nfeather-clothed chief, however, was much disfigured by a huge growth\r\nwith a narrow stalk to it that hung from his neck and rested on his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“I’ll have that off him before he is a week older,” said Bickley,\r\nsurveying this deformity with great professional interest.\r\n\r\nOn they came, the girls with the platters walking ahead. On one of\r\nthese were what looked like joints of baked pork, on another some\r\nplantains and pear-shaped fruits. They knelt down and offered these to\r\nus. We contemplated them for a while. Then Bickley shook his head and\r\nbegan to rub his stomach with appropriate contortions. Clearly they\r\nwere quick-minded enough for they saw the point. At some words the\r\ngirls brought the platters to the chief and others, who took from them\r\nportions of the food at hazard and ate them to show that it was not\r\npoisoned, we watching their throats the while to make sure that it was\r\nswallowed. Then they returned again and we took some of the food though\r\nonly Bickley ate, because, as I pointed out to him, being a doctor who\r\nunderstood the use of antidotes; clearly he should make the experiment.\r\nHowever, nothing happened; indeed he said that it was very good.\r\n\r\nAfter this there came a pause. Then suddenly Bastin took up his parable\r\nin the Polynesian tongue which—to a certain extent—he had acquired with\r\nso much pains.\r\n\r\n“What is this place called?” he asked slowly and distinctly, pausing\r\nbetween each word.\r\n\r\nHis audience shook their heads and he tried again, putting the accents\r\non different syllables. Behold! some bright spirit understood him and\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n“Orofena.”\r\n\r\n“That means a hill, or an island, or a hill in an island,” whispered\r\nBickley to me.\r\n\r\n“Who is your God?” asked Bastin again.\r\n\r\nThe point seemed one upon which they were a little doubtful, but at\r\nlast the chief answered, “Oro. He who fights.”\r\n\r\n“In other words, Mars,” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“I will give you a better one,” said Bastin in the same slow fashion.\r\n\r\nThinking that he referred to himself these children of Nature\r\ncontemplated his angular form doubtfully and shook their heads. Then\r\nfor the first time one of the men who was wearing a mask and a wicker\r\ncrate on his head, spoke in a hollow voice, saying:\r\n\r\n“If you try Oro will eat you up.”\r\n\r\n“Head priest!” said Bickley, nudging me. “Old Bastin had better be\r\ncareful or he will get his teeth into him and call them Oro’s.”\r\n\r\nAnother pause, after which the man in a feather cloak with the growth\r\non his neck that a servant was supporting, said:\r\n\r\n“I am Marama, the chief of Orofena. We have never seen men like you\r\nbefore, if you are men. What brought you here and with you that fierce\r\nand terrible animal, or evil spirit which makes a noise and bites?”\r\n\r\nNow Bickley pretended to consult me who stood brooding and majestic,\r\nthat is if I can be majestic. I whispered something and he answered:\r\n\r\n“The gods of the wind and the sea.”\r\n\r\n“What nonsense,” ejaculated Bastin, “there are no such things.”\r\n\r\n“Shut up,” I said, “we must use similes here,” to which he replied:\r\n\r\n“I don’t like similes that tamper with the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Remember Neptune and Aeolus,” I suggested, and he lapsed into\r\nconsideration of the point.\r\n\r\n“We knew that you were coming,” said Marama. “Our doctors told us all\r\nabout you a moon ago. But we wish that you would come more gently, as\r\nyou nearly washed away our country.”\r\n\r\nAfter looking at me Bickley replied:\r\n\r\n“How thankful should you be that in our kindness we have spared you.”\r\n\r\n“What do you come to do?” inquired Marama again. After the usual\r\nformula of consulting me Bickley answered:\r\n\r\n“We come to take that mountain (he meant lump) off your neck and make\r\nyou beautiful; also to cure all the sickness among your people.”\r\n\r\n“And I come,” broke in Bastin, “to give you new hearts.”\r\n\r\nThese announcements evidently caused great excitement. After\r\nconsultation Marama answered:\r\n\r\n“We do not want new hearts as the old ones are good, but we wish to be\r\nrid of lumps and sicknesses. If you can do this we will make you gods\r\nand worship you and give you many wives.” (Here Bastin held up his\r\nhands in horror.) “When will you begin to take away the lumps?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow,” said Bickley. “But learn that if you try to harm us we\r\nwill bring another wave which will drown all your country.”\r\n\r\nNobody seemed to doubt our capacities in this direction, but one\r\ninquiring spirit in a wicker crate did ask how it came about that if we\r\ncontrolled the ocean we had arrived in half a canoe instead of a whole\r\none.\r\n\r\nBickley replied to the effect that it was because the gods always\r\ntravelled in half-canoes to show their higher nature, which seemed to\r\nsatisfy everyone. Then we announced that we had seen enough of them for\r\nthat day and would retire to think. Meanwhile we should be obliged if\r\nthey would build us a house and keep us supplied with whatever food\r\nthey had.\r\n\r\n“Do the gods eat?” asked the sceptic again.\r\n\r\n“That fellow is a confounded radical,” I whispered to Bickley. “Tell\r\nhim that they do when they come to Orofena.”\r\n\r\nHe did so, whereon the chief said:\r\n\r\n“Would the gods like a nice young girl cooked?”\r\n\r\nAt this point Bastin retired down the path, realising that he had to do\r\nwith cannibals. We said that we preferred to look at the girls alive\r\nand would meet them again to-morrow morning, when we hoped that the\r\nhouse would be ready.\r\n\r\nSo our first interview with the inhabitants of Orofena came to an end,\r\non which we congratulated ourselves.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the remains of the _Star of the South_ we set to work to\r\ntake stock of what was left to us. Fortunately it proved to be a very\r\ngreat deal. As I think I mentioned, all the passenger part of the yacht\r\nlay forward of the bridge, just in front of which the vessel had been\r\nbroken in two, almost as cleanly as though she were severed by a\r\ngigantic knife. Further our stores were forward and practically\r\neverything else that belonged to us, even down to Bickley’s instruments\r\nand medicines and Bastin’s religious works, to say nothing of a great\r\nquantity of tinned food and groceries. Lastly on the deck above the\r\nsaloon had stood two large lifeboats. Although these were amply secured\r\nat the commencement of the gale one of them, that on the port side, was\r\nsmashed to smithers; probably some spar had fallen upon it. The\r\nstarboard boat, however, remained intact and so far as we could judge,\r\nseaworthy, although the bulwarks were broken by the waves.\r\n\r\n“There’s something we can get away in if necessary,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Where to?” remarked Bastin. “We don’t know where we are or if there is\r\nany other land within a thousand miles. I think we had better stop here\r\nas Providence seems to have intended, especially when there is so much\r\nwork to my hand.”\r\n\r\n“Be careful,” answered Bickley, “that the work to your hand does not\r\nend in the cutting of all our throats. It is an awkward thing\r\ninterfering with the religion of savages, and I believe that these\r\nuntutored children of Nature sometimes eat missionaries.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have heard that,” said Bastin; “they bake them first as they do\r\npigs. But I don’t know that they would care to eat me,” and he glanced\r\nat his bony limbs, “especially when you are much plumper. Anyhow one\r\ncan’t stop for a risk of that sort.”\r\n\r\nDeigning no reply, Bickley walked away to fetch some fine fish which\r\nhad been washed up by the tidal wave and were still flapping about in a\r\nlittle pool of salt water. Then we took counsel as to how to make the\r\nbest of our circumstances, and as a result set to work to tidy up the\r\nsaloon and cabins, which was not difficult as what remained of the ship\r\nlay on an even keel. Also we got out some necessary stores, including\r\nparaffin for the swinging lamps with which the ship was fitted in case\r\nof accident to the electric light, candles, and the guns we had brought\r\nwith us so that they might be handy in the event of attack. This done,\r\nby the aid of the tools that were in the storerooms, Bickley, who was\r\nan excellent carpenter, repaired the saloon door, all that was\r\nnecessary to keep us private, as the bulkhead still remained.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said triumphantly when he had finished and got the lock and\r\nbolts to work to his satisfaction, “we can stand a siege if needed, for\r\nas the ship is iron built they can’t even burn us out and that teak\r\ndoor would take some forcing. Also we can shore it up.”\r\n\r\n“How about something to eat? I want my tea,” said Bastin.\r\n\r\n“Then, my reverend friend,” replied Bickley, “take a couple of the fire\r\nbuckets and fetch some water from the stream. Also collect driftwood of\r\nwhich there is plenty about, clean those fish and grill them over the\r\nsaloon stove.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try,” said Bastin, “but I never did any cooking before.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Bickley, “on second thoughts I will see to that myself,\r\nbut you can get the fish ready.”\r\n\r\nSo, with due precautions, Bastin and I fetched water from the stream\r\nwhich we found flowed over the edge of the cliff quite close at hand\r\ninto a beautiful coral basin that might have been designed for a bath\r\nof the nymphs. Indeed one at a time, while the other watched, we\r\nundressed and plunged into it, and never was a tub more welcome than\r\nafter our long days of tempest. Then we returned to find that Bickley\r\nhad already set the table and was engaged in frying the fish very\r\nskilfully on the saloon stove, which proved to be well adapted to the\r\npurpose. He was cross, however, when he found that we had bathed and\r\nthat it was now too late for him to do likewise.\r\n\r\nWhile he was cleaning himself as well as he could in his cabin basin\r\nand Bastin was boiling water for tea, suddenly I remembered the letter\r\nfrom the Danish mate Jacobsen. Concluding that it might now be opened\r\nas we had certainly parted with most of the _Star of the South_ for the\r\nlast time, I read it. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n“The reason, honoured Sir, that I am leaving the ship is that on the\r\nnight I tore up the paper, the spirit controlling the planchette wrote\r\nthese words: ‘After leaving Samoa the _Star of the South_ will be\r\nwrecked in a hurricane and everybody on board drowned except A. B. and\r\nB. Get out of her! Get out of her! Don’t be a fool, Jacob, unless you\r\nwant to come over here at once. Take our advice and get out of her and\r\nyou will live to be old.—SKOLL.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir, I am not a coward but I know that this will happen, for that\r\nspirit which signs itself Skoll never tells a lie. I did try to give\r\nthe captain a hint to stop at Apia, but he had been drinking and openly\r\ncursed me and called me a sneaking cheat. So I am going to run away, of\r\nwhich I am very much ashamed. But I do not wish to be drowned yet as\r\nthere is a girl whom I want to marry, and my mother I support. You will\r\nbe safe and I hope you will not think too badly of me.—JACOB JACOBSEN.\r\n    “_P.S_.—It is an awful thing to know the future. Never try to learn\r\n    that.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI gave this letter to Bastin and Bickley to read and asked them what\r\nthey thought of it.\r\n\r\n“Coincidence,” said Bickley. “The man is a weak-minded idiot and heard\r\nin Samoa that they expected a hurricane.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” chimed in Bastin, “that the devil knows how to look after\r\nhis own at any rate for a little while. I dare say it would have been\r\nmuch better for him to be drowned.”\r\n\r\n“At least he is a deserter and failed in his duty. I never wish to hear\r\nof him again,” I said.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact I never have. But the incident remains quite\r\nunexplained either by Bickley or Bastin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nThe Orofenans\r\n\r\n\r\nTo our shame we had a very pleasant supper that night off the grilled\r\nfish, which was excellent, and some tinned meat. I say to our shame, in\r\na sense, for on our companions the sharks were supping and by rights we\r\nshould have been sunk in woe. I suppose that the sense of our own\r\nescape intoxicated us. Also, notwithstanding his joviality, none of us\r\nhad cared much for the captain, and his policy had been to keep us\r\nsomewhat apart from the crew, of whom therefore we knew but little. It\r\nis true that Bastin held services on Sundays, for such as would attend,\r\nand Bickley had doctored a few of them for minor ailments, but there,\r\nexcept for a little casual conversation, our intercourse began and\r\nended.\r\n\r\nNow the sad fact is that it is hard to be overwhelmed with grief for\r\nthose with whom we are not intimate. We were very sorry and that is all\r\nthat can be said, except that Bastin, being High Church, announced in a\r\nmatter-of-fact way that he meant to put up some petitions for the\r\nwelfare of their souls. To this Bickley retorted that from what he had\r\nseen of their bodies he was sure they needed them.\r\n\r\nYes, it was a pleasant supper, not made less so by a bottle of\r\nchampagne which Bickley and I shared. Bastin stuck to his tea, not\r\nbecause he did not like champagne, but because, as he explained, having\r\nnow come in contact with the heathen it would never do for him to set\r\nthem an example in the use of spirituous liquors.\r\n\r\n“However much we may differ, Bastin, I respect you for that sentiment,”\r\ncommented Bickley.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know why you should,” answered Bastin; “but if so, you might\r\nfollow my example.”\r\n\r\nThat night we slept like logs, trusting to our teak door which we\r\nbarricaded, and to Tommy, who was a most excellent watch-dog, to guard\r\nus against surprise. At any rate we took the risk. As a matter of fact,\r\nnothing happened, though before dawn Tommy did growl a good deal, for I\r\nheard him, but as he sank into slumber again on my bed, I did not get\r\nup. In the morning I found from fresh footprints that two or three men\r\nhad been prowling about the ship, though at a little distance.\r\n\r\nWe rose early, and taking the necessary precautions, bathed in the\r\npool. Then we breakfasted, and having filled every available receptacle\r\nwith water, which took us a long time as these included a large tank\r\nthat supplied the bath, so that we might have at least a week’s supply\r\nin case of siege, we went on deck and debated what we should do. In the\r\nend we determined to stop where we were and await events, because, as I\r\npointed out, it was necessary that we should discover whether these\r\nnatives were hostile or friendly. In the former event we could hold our\r\nown on the ship, whereas away from it we must be overwhelmed; in the\r\nlatter there was always time to move inland.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o’clock when we were seated on stools smoking, with our guns\r\nby our side—for here, owing to the overhanging cliff in which it will\r\nbe remembered the prow of the ship was buried, we could not be reached\r\nby missiles thrown from above—we saw numbers of the islanders advancing\r\nupon us along the beach on either side. They were preceded as before by\r\nwomen who bore food on platters and in baskets. These people, all\r\ntalking excitedly and laughing after their fashion, stopped at a\r\ndistance, so we took no notice of them. Presently Marama, clad in his\r\nfeather cloak, and again accompanied by priests or medicine-men,\r\nappeared walking down the path on the cliff face, and, standing below,\r\nmade salutations and entered into a conversation with us of which I\r\ngive the substance—that is, so far as we could understand it.\r\n\r\nHe reproached us for not having come to him as he expected we would do.\r\nWe replied that we preferred to remain where we were until we were sure\r\nof our greeting and asked him what was the position. He explained that\r\nonly once before, in the time of his grandfather, had any people\r\nreached their shores, also during a great storm as we had done. They\r\nwere dark-skinned men like themselves, three of them, but whence they\r\ncame was never known, since they were at once seized and sacrificed to\r\nthe god Oro, which was the right thing to do in such a case.\r\n\r\nWe asked whether he would consider it right to sacrifice us. He\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\nCertainly, unless we were too strong, being gods ourselves, or unless\r\nan arrangement could be concluded. We asked—what arrangement? He\r\nreplied that we must make them gifts; also that we must do what we had\r\npromised and cure him—the chief—of the disease which had tormented him\r\nfor years. In that event everything would be at our disposal and we,\r\nwith all our belongings, should become _taboo_, holy, not to be\r\ntouched. None would attempt to harm us, nothing should be stolen under\r\npenalty of death.\r\n\r\nWe asked him to come up on the deck with only one companion that his\r\nsickness might be ascertained, and after much hesitation he consented\r\nto do so. Bickley made an examination of the growth and announced that\r\nhe believed it could be removed with perfect safety as the attachment\r\nto the neck was very slight, but of course there was always a risk.\r\nThis was explained to him with difficulty, and much talk followed\r\nbetween him and his followers who gathered on the beach beneath the\r\nship. They seemed adverse to the experiment, till Marama grew furious\r\nwith them and at last burst into tears saying that he could no longer\r\ndrag this terrible burden about with him, and he touched the growth. He\r\nwould rather die. Then they gave way.\r\n\r\nI will tell the rest as shortly as I can.\r\n\r\nA hideous wooden idol was brought on board, wrapped in leaves and\r\nfeathers, and upon it the chief and his head people swore safety to us\r\nwhether he lived or died, making us the guests of their land. There\r\nwere, however, two provisos made, or as such we understood them. These\r\nseemed to be that we should offer no insult or injury to their god, and\r\nsecondly, that we should not set foot on the island in the lake. It was\r\nnot till afterwards that it occurred to me that this must refer to the\r\nmountain top which appeared in the inland sheet of water. To those\r\nstipulations we made no answer. Indeed, the Orofenans did all the\r\ntalking. Finally, they ratified their oaths by a man who, I suppose,\r\nwas a head priest, cutting his arm and rubbing the blood from it on the\r\nlips of the idol; also upon those of the chief. I should add that\r\nBastin had retired as soon as he saw that false god appear, of which I\r\nwas glad, since I felt sure that he would make a scene.\r\n\r\nThe operation took place that afternoon and on the ship, for when once\r\nMarama had made up his mind to trust us he did so very thoroughly. It\r\nwas performed on deck in the presence of an awed multitude who watched\r\nfrom the shore, and when they saw Bickley appear in a clean nightshirt\r\nand wash his hands, uttered a groan of wonder. Evidently they\r\nconsidered it a magical and religious ceremony; indeed ever afterwards\r\nthey called Bickley the Great Priest, or sometimes the Great Healer in\r\nlater days. This was a grievance to Bastin who considered that he had\r\nbeen robbed of his proper title, especially when he learned that among\r\nthemselves he was only known as “the Bellower,” because of the loud\r\nvoice in which he addressed them. Nor did Bickley particularly\r\nappreciate the compliment.\r\n\r\nWith my help he administered the chloroform, which was done under\r\nshelter of a sail for fear lest the people should think that we were\r\nsmothering their chief. Then the operation went on to a satisfactory\r\nconclusion. I omit the details, but an electric battery and a red-hot\r\nwire came into play.\r\n\r\n“There,” said Bickley triumphantly when he had finished tying the\r\nvessels and made everything neat and tidy with bandages, “I was afraid\r\nhe might bleed to death, but I don’t think there is any fear of that\r\nnow, for I have made a real job of it.” Then advancing with the horrid\r\ntumour in his hands he showed it in triumph to the crowd beneath, who\r\ngroaned again and threw themselves on to their faces. Doubtless now it\r\nis the most sacred relic of Orofena.\r\n\r\nWhen Marama came out of the anesthetic, Bickley gave him something\r\nwhich sent him to sleep for twelve hours, during all which time his\r\npeople waited beneath. This was our dangerous period, for our\r\ndifficulty was to persuade them that he was not dead, although Bickley\r\nhad assured them that he would sleep for a time while the magic worked.\r\nStill, I was very glad when he woke up on the following morning, and\r\ntwo or three of his leading men could see that he was alive. The rest\r\nwas lengthy but simple, consisting merely in keeping him quiet and on a\r\nsuitable diet until there was no fear of the wound opening. We achieved\r\nit somehow with the help of an intelligent native woman who, I suppose,\r\nwas one of his wives, and five days later were enabled to present him\r\nhealed, though rather tottery, to his affectionate subjects.\r\n\r\nIt was a great scene, which may be imagined. They bore him away in a\r\nlitter with the native woman to watch him and another to carry the\r\nrelic preserved in a basket, and us they acclaimed as gods.\r\nThenceforward we had nothing to fear in Orofena—except Bastin, though\r\nthis we did not know at the time.\r\n\r\nAll this while we had been living on our ship and growing very bored\r\nthere, although we employed the empty hours in conversation with\r\nselected natives, thereby improving our knowledge of the language.\r\nBickley had the best of it, since already patients began to arrive\r\nwhich occupied him. One of the first was that man whom Tommy had\r\nbitten. He was carried to us in an almost comatose state, suffering\r\napparently from the symptoms of snake poisoning.\r\n\r\nAfterward it turned out that he conceived Tommy to be a divine but most\r\nvenomous lizard that could make a very horrible noise, and began to\r\nsuffer as one might do from the bite of such a creature. Nothing that\r\nBickley could do was enough to save him and ultimately he died in\r\nconvulsions, a circumstance that enormously enhanced Tommy’s\r\nreputation. To tell the truth, we took advantage of it to explain that\r\nTommy was in fact a supernatural animal, a sort of tame demon which\r\nonly harmed people who had malevolent intentions towards those he\r\nserved or who tried to steal any of their possessions or to intrude\r\nupon them at inconvenient hours, especially in the dark. So terrible\r\nwas he, indeed, that even the skill of the Great Priest, _i.e._,\r\nBickley, could not avail to save any whom once he had bitten in his\r\nrage. Even to be barked at by him was dangerous and conveyed a curse\r\nthat might last for generations.\r\n\r\nAll this we set out when Bastin was not there. He had wandered off, as\r\nhe said, to look for shells, but as we knew, to practise religious\r\norations in the Polynesian tongue with the waves for audience, as\r\nDemosthenes is said to have done to perfect himself as a political\r\norator. Personally I admit that I relied more on the terrors of Tommy\r\nto safeguard us from theft and other troubles than I did upon those of\r\nthe native _taboo_ and the priestly oaths.\r\n\r\nThe end of it all was that we left our ship, having padlocked up the\r\ndoor (the padlock, we explained, was a magical instrument that bit\r\nworse than Tommy), and moved inland in a kind of triumphal procession,\r\npriests and singers going before (the Orofenans sang extremely well)\r\nand minstrels following after playing upon instruments like flutes,\r\nwhile behind came the bearers carrying such goods as we needed. They\r\ntook us to a beautiful place in a grove of palms on a ridge where grew\r\nmany breadfruit trees, that commanded a view of the ocean upon one side\r\nand of the lake with the strange brown mountain top on the other. Here\r\nin the midst of the native gardens we found that a fine house had been\r\nbuilt for us of a kind of mud brick and thatched with palm leaves,\r\nsurrounded by a fenced courtyard of beaten earth and having wide\r\noverhanging verandahs; a very comfortable place indeed in that\r\ndelicious climate. In it we took up our abode, visiting the ship\r\noccasionally to see that all was well there, and awaiting events.\r\n\r\nFor Bickley these soon began to happen in the shape of an\r\never-increasing stream of patients. The population of the island was\r\nconsiderable, anything between five and ten thousand, so far as we\r\ncould judge, and among these of course there were a number of sick.\r\nOphthalmia, for instance, was a prevalent disease, as were the growths\r\nsuch as Marama had suffered from, to say nothing of surgical cases and\r\nthose resulting from accident or from nervous ailments. With all of\r\nthese Bickley was called upon to deal, which he did with remarkable\r\nsuccess by help of his books on Tropical Diseases and his ample\r\nsupplies of medical necessaries.\r\n\r\nAt first he enjoyed it very much, but when we had been established in\r\nthe house for about three weeks he remarked, after putting in a solid\r\nten hours of work, that for all the holiday he was getting he might as\r\nwell be back at his old practice, with the difference that there he was\r\nearning several thousands a year. Just then a poor woman arrived with a\r\nbaby in convulsions to whose necessities he was obliged to sacrifice\r\nhis supper, after which came a man who had fallen from a palm tree and\r\nbroken his leg.\r\n\r\nNor did I escape, since having somehow or other established a\r\nreputation for wisdom, as soon as I had mastered sufficient of the\r\nlanguage, every kind of knotty case was laid before me for decision. In\r\nshort, I became a sort of Chief Justice—not an easy office as it\r\ninvolved the acquirement of the native law which was intricate and\r\npeculiar, especially in matrimonial cases.\r\n\r\nAt these oppressive activities Bastin looked on with a gloomy eye.\r\n\r\n“You fellows seem very busy,” he said one evening; “but I can find\r\nnothing to do. They don’t seem to want me, and merely to set a good\r\nexample by drinking water or tea while you swallow whisky and their\r\npalm wine, or whatever it is, is very negative kind of work, especially\r\nas I am getting tired of planting things in the garden and playing\r\npoliceman round the wreck which nobody goes near. Even Tommy is better\r\noff, for at least he can bark and hunt rats.”\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Bickley, “we are following our trades. Arbuthnot is a\r\nlawyer and acts as a judge. I am a surgeon and I may add a general—a\r\nvery general—practitioner and work at medicine in an enormous and\r\nmuch-neglected practice. Therefore, you, being a clergyman, should go\r\nand do likewise. There are some ten thousand people here, but I do not\r\nobserve that as yet you have converted a single one.”\r\n\r\nThus spoke Bickley in a light and unguarded moment with his usual\r\nobject of what is known as “getting a rise” out of Bastin. Little did\r\nhe guess what he was doing.\r\n\r\nBastin thought a while ponderously, then said:\r\n\r\n“It is very strange from what peculiar sources Providence sometimes\r\nsends inspirations. If wisdom flows from babes and sucklings, why\r\nshould it not do so from the well of agnostics and mockers?”\r\n\r\n“There is no reason which I can see,” scoffed Bickley, “except that as\r\na rule wells do not flow.”\r\n\r\n“Your jest is ill-timed and I may add foolish,” continued Bastin. “What\r\nI was about to add was that you have given me an idea, as it was no\r\ndoubt intended that you should do. I will, metaphorically speaking,\r\ngird up my loins and try to bear the light into all this heathen\r\nblackness.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is one of the first you ever had, old fellow. But what’s the\r\nneed of girding up your loins in this hot climate?” inquired Bickley\r\nwith innocence. “Pyjamas and that white and green umbrella of yours\r\nwould do just as well.”\r\n\r\nBastin vouchsafed no reply and sat for the rest of that evening plunged\r\nin deep thought.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning he approached Marama and asked his leave to\r\nteach the people about the gods. The chief readily granted this,\r\nthinking, I believe, that he alluded to ourselves, and orders were\r\nissued accordingly. They were to the effect that Bastin was to be\r\nallowed to go everywhere unmolested and to talk to whom he would about\r\nwhat he would, to which all must listen with respect.\r\n\r\nThus he began his missionary career in Orofena, working at it, good and\r\nearnest man that he was, in a way that excited even the admiration of\r\nBickley. He started a school for children, which was held under a fine,\r\nspreading tree. These listened well, and being of exceedingly quick\r\nintellect soon began to pick up the elements of knowledge. But when he\r\ntried to persuade them to clothe their little naked bodies his failure\r\nwas complete, although after much supplication some of the bigger girls\r\ndid arrive with a chaplet of flowers—round their necks!\r\n\r\nAlso he preached to the adults, and here again was very successful in a\r\nway, especially after he became more familiar with the language. They\r\nlistened; to a certain extent they understood; they argued and put to\r\npoor Bastin the most awful questions such as the whole Bench of Bishops\r\ncould not have answered. Still he did answer them somehow, and they\r\npolitely accepted his interpretation of their theological riddles. I\r\nobserved that he got on best when he was telling them stories out of\r\nthe Old Testament, such as the account of the creation of the world and\r\nof human beings, also of the Deluge, etc. Indeed one of their elders\r\nsaid—Yes, this was quite true. They had heard it all before from their\r\nfathers, and that once the Deluge had taken place round Orofena,\r\nswallowing up great countries, but sparing them because they were so\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nBastin, surprised, asked them who had caused the deluge. They replied,\r\nOro which was the name of their god, Oro who dwelt yonder on the\r\nmountain in the lake, and whose representation they worshipped in\r\nidols. He said that God dwelt in Heaven, to which they replied with\r\ncalm certainty:\r\n\r\n“No, no, he dwells on the mountain in the lake,” which was why they\r\nnever dared to approach that mountain.\r\n\r\nIndeed it was only by giving the name Oro to the Divinity and admitting\r\nthat He might dwell in the mountain as well as everywhere else, that\r\nBastin was able to make progress. Having conceded this, not without\r\nscruples, however, he did make considerable progress, so much, in fact,\r\nthat I perceived that the priests of Oro were beginning to grow very\r\njealous of him and of his increasing authority with the people. Bastin\r\nwas naturally triumphant, and even exclaimed exultingly that within a\r\nyear he would have half of the population baptised.\r\n\r\n“Within a year, my dear fellow,” said Bickley, “you will have your\r\nthroat cut as a sacrifice, and probably ours also. It is a pity, too,\r\nas within that time I should have stamped out ophthalmia and some other\r\ndiseases in the island.”\r\n\r\nHere, leaving Bastin and his good work aside for a while, I will say a\r\nlittle about the country. From information which I gathered on some\r\njourneys that I made and by inquiries from the chief Marama, who had\r\nbecome devoted to us, I found that Orofena was quite a large place. In\r\nshape the island was circular, a broad band of territory surrounding\r\nthe great lake of which I have spoken, that in its turn surrounded a\r\nsmaller island from which rose the mountain top. No other land was\r\nknown to be near the shores of Orofena, which had never been visited by\r\nanyone except the strangers a hundred years ago or so, who were\r\nsacrificed and eaten. Most of the island was covered with forest which\r\nthe inhabitants lacked the energy, and indeed had no tools, to fell.\r\nThey were an extremely lazy people and would only cultivate enough\r\nbananas and other food to satisfy their immediate needs. In truth they\r\nlived mostly upon breadfruit and other products of the wild trees.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that in years of scarcity through drought or\r\nclimatic causes, which prevented the forest trees from bearing, they\r\nsuffered very much from hunger. In such years hundreds of them would\r\nperish and the remainder resorted to the dreadful expedient of\r\ncannibalism. Sometimes, too, the shoals of fish avoided their shores,\r\nreducing them to great misery. Their only domestic animal was the pig\r\nwhich roamed about half wild and in no great numbers, for they had\r\nnever taken the trouble to breed it in captivity. Their resources,\r\ntherefore, were limited, which accounted for the comparative smallness\r\nof the population, further reduced as it was by a wicked habit of\r\ninfanticide practised in order to lighten the burden of bringing up\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThey had no traditions as to how they reached this land, their belief\r\nbeing that they had always been there but that their forefathers were\r\nmuch greater than they. They were poetical, and sang songs in a\r\nlanguage which themselves they could not understand; they said that it\r\nwas the tongue their forefathers had spoken. Also they had several\r\nstrange customs of which they did not know the origin. My own opinion,\r\nwhich Bickley shared, was that they were in fact a shrunken and\r\ndeteriorated remnant of some high race now coming to its end through\r\nage and inter-breeding. About them indeed, notwithstanding their\r\nprimitive savagery which in its qualities much resembled that of other\r\nPolynesians, there was a very curious air of antiquity. One felt that\r\nthey had known the older world and its mysteries, though now both were\r\nforgotten. Also their language, which in time we came to speak\r\nperfectly, was copious, musical, and expressive in its idioms.\r\n\r\nOne circumstance I must mention. In walking about the country I\r\nobserved all over it enormous holes, some of them measuring as much as\r\na hundred yards across, with a depth of fifty feet or more, and this\r\nnot on alluvial lands although there traces of them existed also, but\r\nin solid rock. What this rock was I do not know as none of us were\r\ngeologists, but it seemed to me to partake of the nature of granite.\r\nCertainly it was not coral like that on and about the coast, but of a\r\nprimeval formation.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked Marama what caused these holes, he only shrugged his\r\nshoulders and said he did not know, but their fathers had declared that\r\nthey were made by stones falling from heaven. This, of course,\r\nsuggested meteorites to my mind. I submitted the idea to Bickley, who,\r\nin one of his rare intervals of leisure, came with me to make an\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n“If they were meteorites,” he said, “of which a shower struck the earth\r\nin some past geological age, all life must have been destroyed by them\r\nand their remains ought to exist at the bottom of the holes. To me they\r\nlook more like the effect of high explosives, but that, of course, is\r\nimpossible, though I don’t know what else could have caused such\r\ncraters.”\r\n\r\nThen he went back to his work, for nothing that had to do with\r\nantiquity interested Bickley very much. The present and its problems\r\nwere enough for him, he would say, who neither had lived in the past\r\nnor expected to have any share in the future.\r\n\r\nAs I remained curious I made an opportunity to scramble to the bottom\r\nof one of these craters, taking with me some of the natives with their\r\nwooden tools. Here I found a good deal of soil either washed down from\r\nthe surface or resulting from the decomposition of the rock, though\r\noddly enough in it nothing grew. I directed them to dig. After a while\r\nto my astonishment there appeared a corner of a great worked stone\r\nquite unlike that of the crater, indeed it seemed to me to be a marble.\r\nFurther examination showed that this block was most beautifully carved\r\nin bas-relief, apparently with a design of leaves and flowers. In the\r\ndisturbed soil also I picked up a life-sized marble hand of a woman\r\nexquisitely finished and apparently broken from a statue that might\r\nhave been the work of one of the great Greek sculptors. Moreover, on\r\nthe third finger of this hand was a representation of a ring whereof,\r\nunfortunately, the bezel had been destroyed.\r\n\r\nI put the hand in my pocket, but as darkness was coming on, I could not\r\npursue the research and disinter the block. When I wished to return the\r\nnext day, I was informed politely by Marama that it would not be safe\r\nfor me to do so as the priests of Oro declared that if I sought to\r\nmeddle with the “buried things the god would grow angry and bring\r\ndisaster on me.”\r\n\r\nWhen I persisted he said that at least I must go alone since no native\r\nwould accompany me, and added earnestly that he prayed me not to go. So\r\nto my great regret and disappointment I was obliged to give up the\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nBastin Attempts the Martyr’s Crown\r\n\r\n\r\nThat carved stone and the marble hand took a great hold of my\r\nimagination. What did they mean? How could they have come to the bottom\r\nof that hole, unless indeed they were part of some building and its\r\nornaments which had been destroyed in the neighbourhood? The stone of\r\nwhich we had only uncovered a corner seemed far too big to have been\r\ncarried there from any ship; it must have weighed several tons.\r\nBesides, ships do not carry such things about the world, and none had\r\nvisited this island during the last two centuries at any rate, or local\r\ntradition would have recorded so wonderful a fact. Were there, then,\r\nonce edifices covered with elegant carving standing on this place, and\r\nwere they adorned with lovely statues that would not have disgraced the\r\nbest period of Greek art? The thing was incredible except on the\r\nsupposition that these were relics of an utterly lost civilisation.\r\n\r\nBickley was as much puzzled as myself. All he could say was that the\r\nworld was infinitely old and many things might have happened in it\r\nwhereof we had no record. Even Bastin was excited for a little while,\r\nbut as his imagination was represented by zero, all he could say was:\r\n\r\n“I suppose someone left them there, and anyhow it doesn’t matter much,\r\ndoes it?”\r\n\r\nBut I, who have certain leanings towards the ancient and mysterious,\r\ncould not be put off in this fashion. I remembered that unapproachable\r\nmountain in the midst of the lake and that on it appeared to be\r\nsomething which looked like ruins as seen from the top of the cliff\r\nthrough glasses. At any rate this was a point that I might clear up.\r\n\r\nSaying nothing to anybody, one morning I slipped away and walked to the\r\nedge of the lake, a distance of five or six miles over rough country.\r\nHaving arrived there I perceived that the cone-shaped mountain in the\r\ncentre, which was about a mile from the lake shore, was much larger\r\nthan I had thought, quite three hundred feet high indeed, and with a\r\nvery large circumference. Further, its sides evidently once had been\r\nterraced, and it was on one of these broad terraces, half-way up and\r\nfacing towards the rising sun, that the ruin-like remains were heaped.\r\nI examined them through my glasses. Undoubtedly it was a cyclopean ruin\r\nbuilt of great blocks of coloured stone which seemed to have been\r\nshattered by earthquake or explosion. There were the pillars of a\r\nmighty gateway and the remains of walls.\r\n\r\nI trembled with excitement as I stared and stared. Could I not get to\r\nthe place and see for myself? I observed that from the flat bush-clad\r\nland at the foot of the mountain, ran out what seemed to be the residue\r\nof a stone pier which ended in a large table-topped rock between two\r\nand three hundred feet across. But even this was too far to reach by\r\nswimming, besides for aught I knew there might be alligators in that\r\nlake. I walked up and down its borders, till presently I came to a path\r\nwhich led into a patch of some variety of cotton palm.\r\n\r\nFollowing this path I discovered a boat-house thatched over with palm\r\nleaves. Inside it were two good canoes with their paddles, floating and\r\ntied to the stumps of trees by fibre ropes. Instantly I made up my mind\r\nthat I would paddle to the island and investigate. Just as I was about\r\nto step into one of the canoes the light was cut off. Looking up I saw\r\nthat a man was crouching in the door-place of the boat-house in order\r\nto enter, and paused guiltily.\r\n\r\n“Friend-from-the-Sea” (that was the name that these islanders had given\r\nto me), said the voice of Marama, “say—what are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“I am about to take a row on the lake, Chief,” I answered carelessly.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, Friend. Have we then treated you so badly that you are tired\r\nof life?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Come out into the sunlight, Friend, and I will explain to you.”\r\n\r\nI hesitated till I saw Marama lifting the heavy wooden spear he carried\r\nand remembered that I was unarmed. Then I came out.\r\n\r\n“What does all this mean, Chief?” I asked angrily when we were clear of\r\nthe patch of cotton palm.\r\n\r\n“I mean, Friend, that you have been very near to making a longer\r\njourney than you thought. Have patience now and listen to me. I saw you\r\nleaving the village this morning and followed, suspecting your purpose.\r\nYes, I followed alone, saying nothing to the priests of Oro who\r\nfortunately were away watching the Bellower for their own reasons. I\r\nsaw you searching out the secrets of the mountain with those magic\r\ntubes that make things big that are small, and things that are far off\r\ncome near, and I followed you to the canoes.”\r\n\r\n“All that is plain enough, Marama. But why?”\r\n\r\n“Have I not told you, Friend-from-the-Sea, that yonder hill which is\r\ncalled Orofena, whence this island takes its name, is sacred?”\r\n\r\n“You said so, but what of it?”\r\n\r\n“This: to set foot thereon is to die and, I suppose, great as you are,\r\nyou, too, can die like others. At least, although I love you, had you\r\nnot come away from that canoe I was about to discover whether this is\r\nso.”\r\n\r\n“Then for what are the canoes used?” I asked with irritation.\r\n\r\n“You see that flat rock, Friend, with the hole beyond, which is the\r\nmouth of a cave that appeared only in the great storm that brought you\r\nto our land? They are used to convey offerings which are laid upon the\r\nrock. Beyond it no man may go, and since the beginning no man has ever\r\ngone.”\r\n\r\n“Offerings to whom?”\r\n\r\n“To the Oromatuas, the spirits of the great dead who live there.”\r\n\r\n“Oromatuas? Oro! It is always something to do with Oro. Who and what is\r\nOro?”\r\n\r\n“Oro is a god, Friend, though it is true that the priests say that\r\nabove him there is a greater god called Degai, the Creator, the Fate\r\nwho made all things and directs all things.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, but why do you suppose that Oro, the servant of Degai,\r\nlives in that mountain? I thought that he lived in a grove yonder where\r\nyour priests, as I am told, have an image of him.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know, Friend-from-the-Sea, but so it has been held from the\r\nbeginning. The image in the grove is only visited by his spirit from\r\ntime to time. Now, I pray you, come back and before the priests\r\ndiscover that you have been here, and forget that there are any canoes\r\nupon this lake.”\r\n\r\nSo, thinking it wisest, I turned the matter with a laugh and walked\r\naway with him to the village. On our road I tried to extract some more\r\ninformation but without success. He did not know who built the ruin\r\nupon the mountain, or who destroyed it. He did not know how the\r\nterraces came there. All he knew was that during the convulsion of\r\nNature which resulted in the tidal wave that had thrown our ship upon\r\nthe island, the mountain had been seen to quiver like a tree in the\r\nwind as though within it great forces were at work. Then it was\r\nobserved to have risen a good many more feet above the surface of the\r\nlake, as might be noted by the water mark upon the shore, and then also\r\nthe mouth of the cave had appeared. The priests said that all this was\r\nbecause the Oromatuas who dwelt there were stirring, which portended\r\ngreat things. Indeed great things had happened—for had we not arrived\r\nin their land?\r\n\r\nI thanked him for what he had told me, and, as there was nothing more\r\nto be learned, dropped the subject which was never mentioned between us\r\nagain, at least not for a long while. But in my heart I determined that\r\nI would reach that mountain even though to do so I must risk my life.\r\nSomething seemed to call me to the place; it was as though I were being\r\ndrawn by a magnet.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, before so very long I did go to the mountain, not of my\r\nown will but because I was obliged. It came about thus. One night I\r\nasked Bastin how he was getting on with his missionary work. He\r\nreplied: Very well indeed, but there was one great obstacle in his\r\npath, the idol in the Grove. Were it not for this accursed image he\r\nbelieved that the whole island would become Christian. I asked him to\r\nbe more plain. He explained that all his work was thwarted by this\r\nidol, since his converts declared that they did not dare to be baptised\r\nwhile it sat there in the Grove. If they did, the spirit that was in it\r\nwould bewitch them and perhaps steal out at night and murder them.\r\n\r\n“The spirit being our friends the sorcerers,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“That’s it, Arbuthnot. Do you know, I believe those devilish men\r\nsometimes offer human sacrifices to this satanic fetish, when there is\r\na drought or anything of that sort.”\r\n\r\n“I can quite believe it,” I answered, “but as they will scarcely remove\r\ntheir god and with it their own livelihood and authority, I am afraid\r\nthat as we don’t want to be sacrificed, there is nothing to be done.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment I was called away. As I went I heard Bastin muttering\r\nsomething about martyrs, but paid no attention. Little did I guess what\r\nwas going on in his pious but obstinate mind. In effect it was\r\nthis—that if no one else would remove that idol he was quite ready to\r\ndo it himself.\r\n\r\nHowever, he was very cunning over that business, almost Jesuitical\r\nindeed. Not one word did he breathe of his dark plans to me, and still\r\nless to Bickley. He just went on with his teaching, lamenting from time\r\nto time the stumbling-block of the idol and expressing wonder as to how\r\nit might be circumvented by a change in the hearts of the islanders, or\r\notherwise. Sad as it is to record, in fact, dear old Bastin went as\r\nnear to telling a fib in connection with this matter as I suppose he\r\nhad ever done in his life. It happened thus. One day Bickley’s sharp\r\neye caught sight of Bastin walking about with what looked like a bottle\r\nof whisky in his pocket.\r\n\r\n“Hallo, old fellow,” he said, “has the self-denying ordinance broken\r\ndown? I didn’t know that you took pegs on the sly,” and he pointed to\r\nthe bottle.\r\n\r\n“If you are insinuating, Bickley, that I absorb spirits\r\nsurreptitiously, you are more mistaken than usual, which is saying a\r\ngood deal. This bottle contains, not Scotch whisky but paraffin,\r\nalthough I admit that its label may have misled you, unintentionally,\r\nso far as I am concerned.”\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do with the paraffin?” asked Bickley.\r\n\r\nBastin coloured through his tan and replied awkwardly:\r\n\r\n“Paraffin is very good to keep away mosquitoes if one can stand the\r\nsmell of it upon one’s skin. Not that I have brought it here with that\r\nsole object. The truth is that I am anxious to experiment with a lamp\r\nof my own design made—um—of native wood,” and he departed in a hurry.\r\n\r\n“When next old Bastin wants to tell a lie,” commented Bickley, “he\r\nshould make up his mind as to what it is to be, and stick to it. I\r\nwonder what he is after with that paraffin? Not going to dose any of my\r\npatients with it, I hope. He was arguing the other day that it is a\r\ngreat remedy taken internally, being quite unaware that the lamp\r\nvariety is not used for that purpose.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he means to swallow some himself, just to show that he is\r\nright,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“The stomach-pump is at hand,” said Bickley, and the matter dropped.\r\n\r\nNext morning I got up before it was light. Having some elementary\r\nknowledge of the main facts of astronomy, which remained with me from\r\nboyhood when I had attended lectures on the subject, which I had tried\r\nto refresh by help of an encyclopedia I had brought from the ship, I\r\nwished to attempt to obtain an idea of our position by help of the\r\nstars. In this endeavour, I may say, I failed absolutely, as I did not\r\nknow how to take a stellar or any other observation.\r\n\r\nOn my way out of our native house I observed, by the lantern I carried,\r\nthat the compartment of it occupied by Bastin was empty, and wondered\r\nwhither he had gone at that hour. On arriving at my observation-post, a\r\nrocky eminence on open ground, where, with Tommy at my side, I took my\r\nseat with a telescope, I was astonished to see or rather to hear a\r\ngreat number of the natives walking past the base of the mound towards\r\nthe bush. Then I remembered that some one, Marama, I think, had\r\ninformed me that there was to be a great sacrifice to Oro at dawn on\r\nthat day. After this I thought no more of the matter but occupied\r\nmyself in a futile study of the heavenly bodies. At length the dawn\r\nbroke and put a period to my labours.\r\n\r\nGlancing round me before I descended from the little hill, I saw a\r\nflame of light appear suddenly about half a mile or more away among\r\nthose trees which I knew concealed the image of Oro. On this personally\r\nI had never had the curiosity to look, as I knew that it was only a\r\nhideous idol stuck over with feathers and other bedizenments. The flame\r\nshot suddenly straight into the still air and was followed a few\r\nseconds later by the sound of a dull explosion, after which it went\r\nout. Also it was followed by something else—a scream of rage from an\r\ninfuriated mob.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the hill I stopped to wonder what these sounds might\r\nmean. Then of a sudden appeared Bickley, who had been attending some\r\nurgent case, and asked me who was exploding gunpowder. I told him that\r\nI had no idea.\r\n\r\n“Then I have,” he answered. “It is that ass Bastin up to some game. Now\r\nI guess why he wanted that paraffin. Listen to the row. What are they\r\nafter?”\r\n\r\n“Sacrificing Bastin, perhaps,” I replied, half in jest. “Have you your\r\nrevolver?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded. We always wore our pistols if we went out during the dark\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n“Then perhaps we had better go to see.”\r\n\r\nWe started, and had not covered a hundred yards before a girl, whom I\r\nrecognised as one of Bastin’s converts, came flying towards us and\r\nscreaming out, “Help! Help! They kill the Bellower with fire! They cook\r\nhim like a pig!”\r\n\r\n“Just what I expected,” said Bickley.\r\n\r\nThen we ran hard, as evidently there was no time to lose. While we went\r\nI extracted from the terrified girl, whom we forced to show us the way,\r\nthat as the sacrifice was about to be offered Bastin had appeared, and,\r\n“making fire,” applied it to the god Oro, who instantly burst into\r\nflame. Then he ran back, calling out that the devil was dead. As he did\r\nso there was a loud explosion and Oro flew into pieces. His burning\r\nhead went a long way into the air and, falling on to one of the\r\npriests, killed him. Thereon the other priests and the people seized\r\nthe Bellower and made him fast. Now they were engaged in heating an\r\noven in which to put him to cook. When it was ready they would eat him\r\nin honour of Oro.\r\n\r\n“And serve him right too!” gasped Bickley, who, being stout, was not a\r\ngood runner. “Why can’t he leave other people’s gods alone instead of\r\nblowing them up with gunpowder?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t know,” I answered. “Hope we shall get there in time!”\r\n\r\n“To be cooked and eaten with Bastin!” wheezed Bickley, after which his\r\nbreath gave out.\r\n\r\nAs it chanced we did, for these stone ovens take a long time to heat.\r\nThere by the edge of his fiery grave with his hands and legs bound in\r\npalm-fibre shackles, stood Bastin, quite unmoved, smiling indeed, in a\r\nsort of seraphic way which irritated us both extremely. Round him\r\ndanced the infuriated priests of Oro, and round them, shrieking and\r\nhowling with rage, was most of the population of Orofena. We rushed up\r\nso suddenly that none tried to stop us, and took our stand on either\r\nside of him, producing our pistols as we did so.\r\n\r\n“Thank you for coming,” said Bastin in the silence which followed;\r\n“though I don’t think it is the least use. I cannot recall that any of\r\nthe early martyrs were ever roasted and eaten, though, of course,\r\nthrowing them into boiling oil or water was fairly common. I take it\r\nthat the rite is sacrificial and even in a low sense, sacramental, not\r\nmerely one of common cannibalism.”\r\n\r\nI stared at him, and Bickley gasped out:\r\n\r\n“If you are to be eaten, what does it matter why you are eaten?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” replied Bastin; “there is all the difference in the world, though\r\nit is one that I cannot expect you to appreciate. And now please be\r\nquiet as I wish to say my prayers. I imagine that those stones will be\r\nhot enough to do their office within twenty minutes or so, which is not\r\nvery long.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment Marama appeared, evidently in a state of great\r\nperturbation. With him were some of the priests or sorcerers who were\r\ndancing about as I imagine the priests of Baal must have done, and\r\nfilled with fury. They rolled their eyes, they stuck out their tongues,\r\nthey uttered weird cries and shook their wooden knives at the placid\r\nBastin.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” I asked sternly of the chief.\r\n\r\n“This, Friend-from-the-Sea. The Bellower there, when the sacrifice was\r\nabout to be offered to Oro at the dawn, rushed forward, and having\r\nthrust something between the legs of the image of the god, poured\r\nyellow water over it, and with fire caused it to burst into fierce\r\nflame. Then he ran away and mocked the god who presently, with a loud\r\nreport, flew into pieces and killed that man. Therefore the Bellower\r\nmust be sacrificed.”\r\n\r\n“What to?” I asked. “The image has gone and the piece of it that\r\nascended fell not upon the Bellower, as would have happened if the god\r\nhad been angry with him, but on one of its own priests, whom it killed.\r\nTherefore, having been sacrificed by the god itself, he it is that\r\nshould be eaten, not the Bellower, who merely did what his Spirit bade\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nThis ingenious argument seemed to produce some effect upon Marama, but\r\nto the priests it did not at all appeal.\r\n\r\n“Eat them all!” these cried. “They are the enemies of Oro and have\r\nworked sacrilege!”\r\n\r\nMoreover, to judge from their demeanour, the bulk of the people seemed\r\nto agree with them. Things began to look very ugly. The priests rushed\r\nforward, threatening us with their wooden weapons, and one of them even\r\naimed a blow at Bickley, which only missed him by an inch or two.\r\n\r\n“Look here, my friend,” called the doctor whose temper was rising, “you\r\nname me the Great Priest or Great Healer, do you not? Well, be careful,\r\nlest I should show you that I can kill as well as heal!”\r\n\r\nNot in the least intimidated by this threat the man, a great bedizened\r\nfellow who literally was foaming at the mouth with rage, rushed forward\r\nagain, his club raised, apparently with the object of dashing out\r\nBickley’s brains.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Bickley lifted his revolver and fired. The man, shot through\r\nthe heart, sprang into the air and fell upon his face—stone dead. There\r\nwas consternation, for these people had never seen us shoot anything\r\nbefore, and were quite unacquainted with the properties of firearms,\r\nwhich they supposed to be merely instruments for making a noise. They\r\nstared, they gasped in fear and astonishment, and then they fled,\r\npursued by Tommy, barking, leaving us alone with the two dead men.\r\n\r\n“It was time to teach them a lesson,” said Bickley as he replaced the\r\nempty cartridge, and, seizing the dead man, rolled him into the burning\r\npit.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered; “but presently, when they have got over their\r\nfright, they will come back to teach us one.”\r\n\r\nBastin said nothing; he seemed too dazed at the turn events had taken.\r\n\r\n“What do you suggest?” asked Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Flight,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Where to—the ship? We might hold that.”\r\n\r\n“No; that is what they expect. Look! They are cutting off our road\r\nthere. To the island in the lake where they dare not follow us, for it\r\nis holy ground.”\r\n\r\n“How are we going to live on the island?” asked Bickley.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” I replied; “but I am quite certain that if we stay here\r\nwe shall die.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” he said; “let us try it.”\r\n\r\nWhile we were speaking I was cutting Bastin’s bonds. “Thank you,” he\r\nsaid. “It is a great relief to stretch one’s arms after they have been\r\ncompressed with cords. But at the same time, I do not know that I am\r\nreally grateful. The martyr’s crown was hanging above me, so to speak,\r\nand now it has vanished into the pit, like that man whom Bickley\r\nmurdered.”\r\n\r\n“Look here,” exclaimed the exasperated Bickley, “if you say much more,\r\nBastin, I’ll chuck you into the pit too, to look for your martyr’s\r\ncrown, for I think you have done enough mischief for one morning.”\r\n\r\n“If you are trying to shift the responsibility for that unfortunate\r\nman’s destruction on to me—”\r\n\r\n“Oh! shut it and trot,” broke in Bickley. “Those infernal savages are\r\ncoming with your blessed converts leading the van.”\r\n\r\nSo we “trotted” at no mean pace. As we passed it, Bastin stooped down\r\nand picked up the head of the image of Oro, much as Atalanta in Academy\r\npictures is represented as doing to the apples, and bore it away in\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n“I know it is scorched,” he ejaculated at intervals, “but they might\r\ntrim it up and stick it on to a new body as the original false god. Now\r\nthey _can’t_, for there’s nothing left.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, we were never in any real danger, for our pursuit\r\nwas very half-hearted indeed. To begin with, now that their first rage\r\nwas over, the Orofenans who were fond of us had no particular wish to\r\ndo us to death, while the ardour of their sorcerers, who wished this\r\nvery much, had been greatly cooled by the mysterious annihilation of\r\ntheir idol and the violent deaths of two of their companions, which\r\nthey thought might be reduplicated in their own persons. So it came\r\nabout that the chase, if noisy, was neither close nor eager.\r\n\r\nWe reached the edge of the lake where was the boat-house of which I\r\nhave spoken already, travelling at little more than a walk. Here we\r\nmade Bastin unfasten the better of the two canoes that by good luck was\r\nalmost filled with offerings, which doubtless, according to custom,\r\nmust be made upon the day of this feast to Oro, while we watched\r\nagainst surprise at the boat-house door. When he was ready we slipped\r\nin and took our seats, Tommy jumping in after us, and pushed the canoe,\r\nnow very heavily laden, out into the lake.\r\n\r\nHere, at a distance of about forty paces, which we judged to be beyond\r\nwooden spear-throw, we rested upon our paddles to see what would\r\nhappen. All the crowd of islanders had rushed to the lake edge where\r\nthey stood staring at us stupidly. Bastin, thinking the occasion\r\nopportune, lifted the hideous head of the idol which he had carefully\r\nwashed, and began to preach on the downfall of “the god of the Grove.”\r\n\r\nThis action of his appeared to awake memories or forebodings in the\r\nminds of his congregation. Perhaps some ancient prophecy was\r\nconcerned—I do not know. At any rate, one of the priests shouted\r\nsomething, whereon everybody began to talk at once. Then, stooping\r\ndown, they threw water from the lake over themselves and rubbed its\r\nsand and mud into their hair, all the while making genuflexions toward\r\nthe mountain in the middle, after which they turned and departed.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think we had better go back?” asked Bastin. “Evidently my\r\nwords have touched them and their minds are melting beneath the light\r\nof Truth.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! by all means,” replied Bickley with sarcasm; “for then their\r\nspears will touch _us_, and our bodies will soon be melting above the\r\nfires of that pit.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right,” said Bastin; “at least, I admit that you have\r\nmade matters very difficult by your unjustifiable homicide of that\r\npriest who I do not think meant to injure you seriously, and really was\r\nnot at all a bad fellow, though opinionated in some ways. Also, I do\r\nnot suppose that anybody is expected, as it were, to run his head into\r\nthe martyr’s crown. When it settles there of itself it is another\r\nmatter.”\r\n\r\n“Like a butterfly!” exclaimed the enraged Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Yes, if you like to put it that way, though the simile seems a very\r\npoor one; like a sunbeam would be better.”\r\n\r\nHere Bickley gave way with his paddle so vigorously that the canoe was\r\nas nearly as possible upset into the lake.\r\n\r\nIn due course we reached the flat Rock of Offerings, which proved to be\r\nquite as wide as a double croquet lawn and much longer.\r\n\r\n“What are those?” I asked, pointing to certain knobs on the edge of the\r\nrock at a spot where a curved projecting point made a little harbour.\r\n\r\nBickley examined them, and answered:\r\n\r\n“I should say that they are the remains of stone mooring-posts worn\r\ndown by many thousands of years of weather. Yes, look, there is the cut\r\nof the cables upon the base of that one, and very big cables they must\r\nhave been.”\r\n\r\nWe stared at one another—that is, Bickley and I did, for Bastin was\r\nstill engaged in contemplating the blackened head of the god which he\r\nhad overthrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nThe Island in the Lake\r\n\r\n\r\nWe made the canoe fast and landed on the great rock, to perceive that\r\nit was really a peninsula. That is to say, it was joined to the main\r\nland of the lake island by a broad roadway quite fifty yards across,\r\nwhich appeared to end in the mouth of the cave. On this causeway we\r\nnoted a very remarkable thing, namely, two grooves separated by an\r\nexact distance of nine feet which ran into the mouth of the cave and\r\nvanished there.\r\n\r\n“Explain!” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Paths,” I said, “worn by countless feet walking on them for thousands\r\nof years.”\r\n\r\n“You should cultivate the art of observation, Arbuthnot. What do you\r\nsay, Bastin?”\r\n\r\nHe stared at the grooves through his spectacles, and replied:\r\n\r\n“I don’t say anything, except that I can’t see anybody to make paths\r\nhere. Indeed, the place seems quite unpopulated, and all the Orofenans\r\ntold me that they never landed on it because if they did they would\r\ndie. It is a part of their superstitious nonsense. If you have any idea\r\nin your head you had better tell us quickly before we breakfast. I am\r\nvery hungry.”\r\n\r\n“You always are,” remarked Bickley; “even when most people’s appetites\r\nmight have been affected. Well, I think that this great plateau was\r\nonce a landing-place for flying machines, and that there is the\r\nair-shed or garage.”\r\n\r\nBastin stared at him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think we had better breakfast?” he said. “There are two\r\nroast pigs in that canoe, and lots of other food, enough to last us a\r\nweek, I should say. Of course, I understand that the blood you have\r\nshed has thrown you off your balance. I believe it has that effect,\r\nexcept on the most hardened. Flying machines were only invented a few\r\nyears ago by the brothers Wright in America.”\r\n\r\n“Bastin,” said Bickley, “I begin to regret that I did not leave you to\r\ntake part in another breakfast yonder—I mean as the principal dish.”\r\n\r\n“It was Providence, not you, who prevented it, Bickley, doubtless\r\nbecause I am unworthy of such a glorious end.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is lucky that Providence is a good shot with a pistol. Stop\r\ntalking nonsense and listen. If those were paths worn by feet they\r\nwould run to the edge of the rock. They do not. They begin there in\r\nthat gentle depression and slope upwards somewhat steeply. The air\r\nmachines, which were evidently large, lit in the depression, possibly\r\nas a bird does, and then ran on wheels or sledge skids along the\r\ngrooves to the air-shed in the mountain. Come to the cave and you will\r\nsee.”\r\n\r\n“Not till we have breakfast,” said Bastin. “I will get out a pig. As a\r\nmatter of fact, I had no supper last night, as I was taking a class of\r\nnative boys and making some arrangements of my own.”\r\n\r\nAs for me, I only whistled. It all seemed very feasible. And yet how\r\ncould such things be?\r\n\r\nWe unloaded the canoe and ate. Bastin’s appetite was splendid. Indeed,\r\nI had to ask him to remember that when this supply was done I did not\r\nknow where we should find any more.\r\n\r\n“Take no thought for the morrow,” he replied. “I have no doubt it will\r\ncome from somewhere,” and he helped himself to another chop.\r\n\r\nNever had I admired him so much. Not a couple of hours before he was\r\nabout to be cruelly murdered and eaten. But this did not seem to affect\r\nhim in the least. Bastin was the only man I have ever known with a\r\nreally perfect faith. It is a quality worth having and one that makes\r\nfor happiness. What a great thing not to care whether you are\r\nbreakfasted on, or breakfast!\r\n\r\n“I see that there is lots of driftwood about here,” he remarked, “but\r\nunfortunately we have no tea, so in this climate it is of little use,\r\nunless indeed we can catch some fish and cook them.”\r\n\r\n“Stop talking about eating and help us to haul up the canoe,” said\r\nBickley.\r\n\r\nBetween the three of us we dragged and carried the canoe a long way\r\nfrom the lake, fearing lest the natives should come and bear it off\r\nwith our provisions. Then, having given Tommy his breakfast off the\r\nscraps, we walked to the cave. I glanced at my companions. Bickley’s\r\nface was alight with scientific eagerness. Here are not dreams or\r\nspeculations, but facts to be learned, it seemed to say, and I will\r\nlearn them. The past is going to show me some of its secrets, to tell\r\nme how men of long ago lived and died and how far they had advanced to\r\nthat point on the road of civilisation at which I stand in my little\r\nhour of existence.\r\n\r\nThat of Bastin was mildly interested, no more. Obviously, with half his\r\nmind he was thinking of something else, probably of his converts on the\r\nmain island and of the school class fixed for this hour which\r\ncircumstances prevented him from attending. Indeed, like Lot’s wife he\r\nwas casting glances behind him towards the wicked place from which he\r\nhad been forced to flee.\r\n\r\nNeither the past nor the future had much real interest for Bastin; any\r\nmore than they had for Bickley, though for different reasons. The\r\nformer was done with; the latter he was quite content to leave in other\r\nhands. If he had any clear idea thereof, probably that undiscovered\r\nland appeared to him as a big, pleasant place where are no unbelievers\r\nor erroneous doctrines, and all sinners will be sternly repressed, in\r\nwhich, clad in a white surplice with all proper ecclesiastical\r\ntrappings, he would argue eternally with the Early Fathers and in due\r\ncourse utterly annihilate Bickley, that is in a moral sense. Personally\r\nand as a man he was extremely attached to Bickley as a necessary and\r\nwrong-headed nuisance to which he had become accustomed.\r\n\r\nAnd I! What did I feel? I do not know; I cannot describe. An\r\nextraordinary attraction, a semi-spiritual exaltation, I think. That\r\ncave mouth might have been a magnet drawing my soul. With my body I\r\nshould have been afraid, as I daresay I was, for our circumstances were\r\nsufficiently desperate. Here we were, castaways upon an island,\r\nprobably uncharted, one of thousands in the recesses of a vast ocean,\r\nfrom which we had little chance of escape. More, having offended the\r\nreligious instincts of the primeval inhabitants of that island, we had\r\nbeen forced to flee to a rocky mountain in the centre of a lake, where,\r\nafter the food we had brought with us by accident was consumed, we\r\nshould no doubt be forced to choose between death by starvation, or, if\r\nwe attempted to retreat, at the hands of justly infuriated savages. Yet\r\nthese facts did not oppress me, for I was being drawn, drawn to I knew\r\nnot what, and if it were to doom—well, no matter.\r\n\r\nTherefore, none of us cared: Bastin because his faith was equal to any\r\nemergency and there was always that white-robed heaven waiting for him\r\nbeyond which his imagination did not go (I often wondered whether he\r\npictured Mrs. Bastin as also waiting; if so, he never said anything\r\nabout her); Bickley because as a child of the Present and a servant of\r\nknowledge he feared no future, believing it to be for him non-existent,\r\nand was careless as to when his strenuous hour of life should end; and\r\nI because I felt that yonder lay my true future; yes, and my true past,\r\neven though to discover them I must pass through that portal which we\r\nknow as Death.\r\n\r\nWe reached the mouth of the cave. It was a vast place; perhaps the arch\r\nof it was a hundred feet high, and I could see that once all this arch\r\nhad been adorned with sculptures. Protected as these were by the\r\noverhanging rock, for the sculptured mouth of the cave was cut deep\r\ninto the mountain face, they were still so worn that it was impossible\r\nto discern their details. Time had eaten them away like an acid. But\r\nwhat length of time? I could not guess, but it must have been\r\nstupendous to have worked thus upon that hard and sheltered rock.\r\n\r\nThis came home to me with added force when, from subsequent\r\nexamination, we learned that the entire mouth of this cave had been\r\nsealed up for unnumbered ages. It will be remembered that Marama told\r\nme the mountain in the lake had risen much during the frightful cyclone\r\nin which we were wrecked and with it the cave mouth which previously\r\nhad been invisible. From the markings on the mountain side it was\r\nobvious that something of the sort had happened very recently, at any\r\nrate on this eastern face. That is, either the flat rock had sunk or\r\nthe volcano had been thrown upwards.\r\n\r\nOnce in the far past the cave had been as it was when we found it. Then\r\nit had gone down in such a way that the table-rock entirely sealed the\r\nentrance. Now this entrance was once more open, and although of course\r\nthere was a break in them, the grooves of which I have spoken ran on\r\ninto the cave at only a slightly different level from that at which\r\nthey lay upon the flat rock. And yet, although they had been thus\r\nsheltered by a great stone curtain in front of them, still these\r\nsculptures were worn away by the tooth of Time. Of course, however,\r\nthis may have happened to them _before_ they were buried in some\r\nancient cataclysm, to be thus resurrected at the hour of our arrival\r\nupon the island.\r\n\r\nWithout pausing to make any closer examination of these crumbled\r\ncarvings, we entered the yawning mouth of that great place, following\r\nand indeed walking in the deep grooves that I have mentioned. Presently\r\nit seemed to open out as a courtyard might at the end of a passage;\r\nyes, to open on to some vast place whereof in that gloom we could not\r\nsee the roof or the limits. All we knew was that it must be\r\nenormous—the echoes of our voices and footsteps told us as much, for\r\nthese seemed to come back to us from high, high above and from far, far\r\naway. Bickley and I said nothing; we were too overcome. But Bastin\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n“Did you ever go to Olympia? I did once to see a kind of play where the\r\npeople said nothing, only ran about dressed up. They told me it was\r\nreligious, the sort of thing a clergyman should study. I didn’t think\r\nit religious at all. It was all about a nun who had a baby.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what of it?” snapped Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Nothing particular, except that nuns don’t have babies, or if they do\r\nthe fact should not be advertised. But I wasn’t thinking of that. I was\r\nthinking that this place is like an underground Olympia.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, be quiet!” I said, for though Bastin’s description was not bad,\r\nhis monotonous, drawling voice jarred on me in that solemnity.\r\n\r\n“Be careful where you walk,” whispered Bickley, for even he seemed\r\nawed, “there may be pits in this floor.”\r\n\r\n“I wish we had a light,” I said, halting.\r\n\r\n“If candles are of any use,” broke in Bastin, “as it happens I have a\r\npacket in my pocket. I took them with me this morning for a certain\r\npurpose.”\r\n\r\n“Not unconnected with the paraffin and the burning of the idol, I\r\nsuppose?” said Bickley. “Hand them over.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; if I had been allowed a little more time I intended—”\r\n\r\n“Never mind what you intended; we know what you did and that’s enough,”\r\nsaid Bickley as he snatched the packet from Bastin’s hand and proceeded\r\nto undo it, adding, “By heaven! I have no matches, nor have you,\r\nArbuthnot!”\r\n\r\n“I have a dozen boxes of wax vestas in my other pocket,” said Bastin.\r\n“You see, they burn so well when you want to get up a fire on a damp\r\nidol. As you may have noticed, the dew is very heavy here.”\r\n\r\nIn due course these too were produced. I took possession of them as\r\nthey were too valuable to be left in the charge of Bastin, and,\r\nextracting a box from the packet, lit two of the candles which were of\r\nthe short thick variety, like those used in carriage-lamps.\r\n\r\nPresently they burned up, making two faint stars of light which,\r\nhowever, were not strong enough to show us either the roof or the sides\r\nof that vast place. By their aid we pursued our path, still following\r\nthe grooves till suddenly these came to an end. Now all around us was a\r\nflat floor of rock which, as we perceived clearly when we pushed aside\r\nthe dust that had gathered thickly on it in the course of ages,\r\ndoubtless from the gradual disintegration of the stony walls, had once\r\nbeen polished till it resembled black marble. Indeed, certain cracks in\r\nthe floor appeared to have been filled in with some dark-coloured\r\ncement. I stood looking at them while Bickley wandered off to the right\r\nand a little forward, and presently called to me. I walked to him,\r\nBastin sticking close to me as I had the other candle, as did the\r\nlittle dog, Tommy, who did not like these new surroundings and would\r\nnot leave my heels.\r\n\r\n“Look,” said Bickley, holding up his candle, “and tell me—what’s that?”\r\n\r\nBefore me, faintly shown, was some curious structure of gleaming rods\r\nmade of yellowish metal, which rods appeared to be connected by wires.\r\nThe structure might have been forty feet high and perhaps a hundred\r\nlong. Its bottom part was buried in dust.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” asked Bickley again.\r\n\r\nI made no answer, for I was thinking. Bastin, however, replied:\r\n\r\n“It’s difficult to be sure in this light, but I should think that it\r\nmay be the remains of a cage in which some people who lived here kept\r\nmonkeys, or perhaps it was an aviary. Look at those little ladders for\r\nthe monkeys to climb by, or possibly for the birds to sit on.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure it wasn’t tame angels?” asked Bickley.\r\n\r\n“What a ridiculous remark! How can you keep an angel in a cage? I—”\r\n\r\n“Aeroplane!” I almost whispered to Bickley.\r\n\r\n“You’ve got it!” he answered. “The framework of an aeroplane and a\r\njolly large one, too. Only why hasn’t it oxidised?”\r\n\r\n“Some indestructible metal,” I suggested. “Gold, for instance, does not\r\noxidise.”\r\n\r\nHe nodded and said:\r\n\r\n“We shall have to dig it out. The dust is feet thick about it; we can\r\ndo nothing without spades. Come on.”\r\n\r\nWe went round to the end of the structure, whatever it might be, and\r\npresently came to another. Again we went on and came to another, all of\r\nthem being berthed exactly in line.\r\n\r\n“What did I tell you?” said Bickley in a voice of triumph. “A whole\r\ngarage full, a regular fleet of aeroplanes!”\r\n\r\n“That must be nonsense,” said Bastin, “for I am quite sure that these\r\nOrofenans cannot make such things. Indeed they have no metal, and even\r\ncut the throats of pigs with wooden knives.”\r\n\r\nNow I began to walk forward, bearing to the left so as to regain our\r\nformer line. We could do nothing with these metal skeletons, and I felt\r\nthat there must be more to find beyond. Presently I saw something\r\nlooming ahead of me and quickened my pace, only to recoil. For there,\r\nnot thirty feet away and perhaps three hundred yards from the mouth of\r\nthe cave, suddenly appeared what looked like a gigantic man. Tommy saw\r\nit also and barked as dogs do when they are frightened, and the sound\r\nof his yaps echoed endlessly from every quarter, which scared him to\r\nsilence. Recovering myself I went forward, for now I guessed the truth.\r\nIt was not a man but a statue.\r\n\r\nThe thing stood upon a huge base which lessened by successive steps,\r\neight of them, I think, to its summit. The foot of this base may have\r\nbeen a square of fifty feet or rather more; the real support or\r\npedestal of the statue, however, was only a square of about six feet.\r\nThe figure itself was little above life-size, or at any rate above our\r\nlife-size, say seven feet in height. It was very peculiar in sundry\r\nways.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, nothing of the body was visible, for it was swathed like\r\na corpse. From these wrappings projected one arm, the right, in the\r\nhand of which was the likeness of a lighted torch. The head was not\r\nveiled. It was that of a man, long-nosed, thin-lipped, stern-visaged;\r\nthe countenance pervaded by an awful and unutterable calm, as deep as\r\nthat of Buddha only less benign. On the brow was a wreathed head-dress,\r\nnot unlike an Eastern turban, from which sprang two little wings\r\nresembling in some degree those on the famous Greek head of Hypnos,\r\nlord of Sleep. Between the folds of the wrappings on the back sprang\r\ntwo other wings, enormous wings bent like those of a bird about to take\r\nflight. Indeed the whole attitude of the figure suggested that it was\r\nspringing from earth to air. It was executed in black basalt or some\r\nstone of the sort, and very highly finished. For instance, on the bare\r\nfeet and the arm which held the torch could be felt every muscle and\r\neven some of the veins. In the same way the details of the skull were\r\nperfectly perceptible to the touch, although at first sight not visible\r\non the marble surface. This was ascertained by climbing on the pedestal\r\nand feeling the face with our hands.\r\n\r\nHere I may say that its modelling as well as that of the feet and the\r\narm filled Bickley, who, of course, was a highly trained anatomist,\r\nwith absolute amazement. He said that he would never have thought it\r\npossible that such accuracy could have been reached by an artist\r\nworking in so hard a material.\r\n\r\nWhen the others had arrived we studied this relic as closely as our two\r\ncandles would allow, and in turn expressed our opinions of its\r\nsignificance. Bastin thought that if those things down there were\r\nreally the remains of aeroplanes, which he did not believe, the statue\r\nhad something to do with flying, as was shown by the fact that it had\r\nwings on its head and shoulders. Also, he added, after examining the\r\nface, the head was uncommonly like that of the idol that he had blown\r\nup. It had the same long nose and severe shut mouth. If he was right,\r\nthis was probably another effigy of Oro which we should do well to\r\ndestroy at once before the islanders came to worship it.\r\n\r\nBickley ground his teeth as he listened to him.\r\n\r\n“Destroy that!” he gasped. “Destroy! Oh! you, you—early Christian.”\r\n\r\nHere I may state that Bastin was quite right, as we proved subsequently\r\nwhen we compared the head of the fetish, which, as it will be\r\nremembered, he had brought away with him, with that of the statue.\r\nAllowing for an enormous debasement of art, they were essentially\r\nidentical in the facial characteristics. This would suggest the descent\r\nof a tradition through countless generations. Or of course it may have\r\nbeen accidental. I am sure I do not know, but I think it possible that\r\nfor unknown centuries other old statues may have existed in Orofena\r\nfrom which the idol was copied. Or some daring and impious spirit may\r\nhave found his way to the cave in past ages and fashioned the local god\r\nupon this ancient model.\r\n\r\nBickley was struck at once, as I had been, with the resemblance of the\r\nfigure to that of the Egyptian Osiris. Of course there were\r\ndifferences. For instance, instead of the crook and the scourge, this\r\ndivinity held a torch. Again, in place of the crown of Egypt it wore a\r\nwinged head-dress, though it is true this was not very far removed from\r\nthe winged disc of that country. The wings that sprang from its\r\nshoulders, however, suggested Babylonia rather than Egypt, or the\r\nAssyrian bulls that are similarly adorned. All of these symbolical\r\nideas might have been taken from that figure. But what was it? What was\r\nit?\r\n\r\nIn a flash the answer came to me. A representation of the spirit of\r\nDeath! Neither more nor less. There was the shroud; there the cold,\r\ninscrutable countenance suggesting mysteries that it hid. But the torch\r\nand the wings? Well, the torch was that which lighted souls to the\r\nother world, and on the wings they flew thither. Whoever fashioned that\r\nstatue hoped for another life, or so I was convinced.\r\n\r\nI explained my ideas. Bastin thought them fanciful and preferred his\r\nnotion of a flying man, since by constitution he was unable to discover\r\nanything spiritual in any religion except his own. Bickley agreed that\r\nit was probably an allegorical representation of death but sniffed at\r\nmy interpretation of the wings and the torch, since by constitution he\r\ncould not believe that the folly of a belief in immortality could have\r\ndeveloped so early in the world, that is, among a highly civilised\r\npeople such as must have produced this statue.\r\n\r\nWhat we could none of us understand was why this ominous image with its\r\ndead, cold face should have been placed in an aerodrome, nor in fact\r\ndid we ever discover. Possibly it was there long before the cave was\r\nput to this use. At first the place may have been a temple and have so\r\nremained until circumstances forced the worshippers to change their\r\nhabits, or even their Faith.\r\n\r\nWe examined this wondrous work and the pedestal on which it stood as\r\nclosely as we were able by the dim light of our candles. I was anxious\r\nto go further and see what lay beyond it; indeed we did walk a few\r\npaces, twenty perhaps, onward into the recesses of the cave.\r\n\r\nThen Bickley discovered something that looked like the mouth of a well\r\ndown which he nearly tumbled, and Bastin began to complain that he was\r\nhot and very thirsty; also to point out that he wished for no more\r\ncaves and idols at present.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Arbuthnot,” said Bickley, “these candles are burning low\r\nand we don’t want to use up more if we can prevent it, for we may need\r\nwhat we have got very badly later on. Now, according to my pocket\r\ncompass the mouth of this cave points due east; probably at the\r\nbeginning it was orientated to the rising sun for purposes of\r\nastronomical observation or of worship at certain periods of the year.\r\nFrom the position of the sun when we landed on the rock this morning I\r\nimagine that just now it rises almost exactly opposite to the mouth of\r\nthe cave. If this is so, to-morrow at dawn, for a time at least, the\r\nlight should penetrate as far as the statue, and perhaps further. What\r\nI suggest is that we should wait till then to explore.”\r\n\r\nI agreed with him, especially as I was feeling tired, being exhausted\r\nby wonder, and wanted time to think. So we turned back. As we did so I\r\nmissed Tommy and inquired anxiously where he was, being afraid lest he\r\nmight have tumbled down the well-like hole.\r\n\r\n“He’s all right,” said Bastin. “I saw him sniffing at the base of that\r\nstatue. I expect there is a rat in there, or perhaps a snake.”\r\n\r\nSure enough when we reached it there was Tommy with his black nose\r\npressed against the lowest of the tiers that formed the base of the\r\nstatue, and sniffing loudly. Also he was scratching in the dust as a\r\ndog does when he has winded a rabbit in a hole. So engrossed was he in\r\nthis occupation that it was with difficulty that I coaxed him to leave\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nI did not think much of the incident at that time, but afterwards it\r\ncame back to me, and I determined to investigate those stones at the\r\nfirst opportunity.\r\n\r\nPassing the wrecks of the machines, we emerged on to the causeway\r\nwithout accident. After we had rested and washed we set to work to draw\r\nour canoe with its precious burden of food right into the mouth of the\r\ncave, where we hid it as well as we could.\r\n\r\nThis done we went for a walk round the base of the peak. This proved to\r\nbe a great deal larger than we had imagined, over two miles in\r\ncircumference indeed. All about it was a belt of fertile land, as I\r\nsuppose deposited there by the waters of the great lake and resulting\r\nfrom the decay of vegetation. Much of this belt was covered with\r\nancient forest ending in mud flats that appeared to have been thrown up\r\nrecently, perhaps at the time of the tidal wave which bore us to\r\nOrofena. On the higher part of the belt were many of the extraordinary\r\ncrater-like holes that I have mentioned as being prevalent on the main\r\nisland; indeed the place had all the appearance of having been\r\nsubjected to a terrific and continuous bombardment.\r\n\r\nWhen we had completed its circuit we set to work to climb the peak in\r\norder to explore the terraces of which I have spoken and the ruins\r\nwhich I had seen through my field-glasses. It was quite true; they were\r\nterraces cut with infinite labour out of the solid rock, and on them\r\nhad once stood a city, now pounded into dust and fragments. We\r\nstruggled over the broken blocks of stone to what we had taken for a\r\ntemple, which stood near the lip of the crater, for without doubt this\r\nmound was an extinct volcano, or rather its crest. All we could make\r\nout when we arrived was that here had once stood some great building,\r\nfor its courts could still be traced; also there lay about fragments of\r\nsteps and pillars.\r\n\r\nApparently the latter had once been carved, but the passage of\r\ninnumerable ages had obliterated the work and we could not turn these\r\ngreat blocks over to discover if any remained beneath. It was as though\r\nthe god Thor had broken up the edifice with his hammer, or Jove had\r\nshattered it with his thunderbolts; nothing else would account for that\r\nutter wreck, except, as Bickley remarked significantly, the scientific\r\nuse of high explosives.\r\n\r\nFollowing the line of what seemed to have been a road, we came to the\r\nedge of the volcano and found, as we expected, the usual depression out\r\nof which fire and lava had once been cast, as from Hecla or Vesuvius.\r\nIt was now a lake more than a quarter of a mile across. Indeed it had\r\nbeen thus in the ancient days when the buildings stood upon the\r\nterraces, for we saw the remains of steps leading down to the water.\r\nPerhaps it had served as the sacred lake of the temple.\r\n\r\nWe gazed with wonderment and then, wearied out, scrambled back through\r\nthe ruins, which, by the way, were of a different stone from the lava\r\nof the mountain, to the mouth of the great cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nThe Dwellers in the Tomb\r\n\r\n\r\nBy now it was drawing towards sunset, so we made such preparations as\r\nwe could for the night. One of these was to collect dry driftwood, of\r\nwhich an abundance lay upon the shore, to serve us for firing, though\r\nunfortunately we had nothing that we could cook for our meal.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus engaged we saw a canoe approaching the table-rock\r\nand perceived that in it were the chief Marama and a priest. After\r\nhovering about for a while they paddled the canoe near enough to allow\r\nof conversation which, taking no notice of their presence, we left it\r\nto them to begin.\r\n\r\n“O, Friend-from-the-Sea,” called Marama, addressing myself, “we come to\r\npray you and the Great Healer to return to us to be our guests as\r\nbefore. The people are covered with darkness because of the loss of\r\nyour wisdom, and the sick cry aloud for the Healer; indeed two of those\r\nwhom he has cut with knives are dying.”\r\n\r\n“And what of the Bellower?” I asked, indicating Bastin.\r\n\r\n“We should like to see him back also, Friend-from-the-Sea, that we may\r\nsacrifice and eat him, who destroyed our god with fire and caused the\r\nHealer to kill his priest.”\r\n\r\n“That is most unjust,” exclaimed Bastin. “I deeply regret the blood\r\nthat was shed on the occasion, unnecessarily as I think.”\r\n\r\n“Then go and atone for it with your own,” said Bickley, “and everybody\r\nwill be pleased.”\r\n\r\nWaving to them to be silent, I said:\r\n\r\n“Are you mad, Marama, that you should ask us to return to sojourn among\r\npeople who tried to kill us, merely because the Bellower caused fire to\r\nburn an image of wood and its head to fly from its shoulders, just to\r\nshow you that it had no power to hold itself together, although you\r\ncall it a god? Not so, we wash our hands of you; we leave you to go\r\nyour own way while we go ours, till perchance in a day to come, after\r\nmany misfortunes have overtaken you, you creep about our feet and with\r\nprayers and offerings beg us to return.”\r\n\r\nI paused to observe the effect of my words. It was excellent, for both\r\nMarama and the priest wrung their hands and groaned. Then I went on:\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile we have something to tell you. We have entered the cave\r\nwhere you said no man might set a foot, and have seen him who sits\r\nwithin, the true god.” (Here Bastin tried to interrupt, but was\r\nsuppressed by Bickley.)\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other in a frightened way and groaned more loudly\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\n“He sends you a message, which, as he told us of your approach, we came\r\nto the shore to deliver to you.”\r\n\r\n“How can you say that?” began Bastin, but was again violently\r\nsuppressed by Bickley.\r\n\r\n“It is that he, the real Oro, rejoices that the false Oro, whose face\r\nis copied from his face, has been destroyed. It is that he commands you\r\nday by day to bring food in plenty and lay it upon the Rock of\r\nOfferings, not forgetting a supply of fresh fish from the sea, and with\r\nit all those things that are stored in the house wherein we, the\r\nstrangers from the sea, deigned to dwell awhile until we left you\r\nbecause in your wickedness you wished to murder us.”\r\n\r\n“And if we refuse—what then?” asked the priest, speaking for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“Then Oro will send death and destruction upon you. Then your food\r\nshall fail and you shall perish of sickness and want, and the\r\nOromatuas, the spirits of the great dead, shall haunt you in your\r\nsleep, and Oro shall eat up your souls.”\r\n\r\nAt these horrible threats both of them uttered a kind of wail, after\r\nwhich, Marama asked:\r\n\r\n“And if we consent, what then, Friend-from-the-Sea?”\r\n\r\n“Then, perchance,” I answered, “in some day to come we may return to\r\nyou, that I may give you of my wisdom and the Great Healer may cure\r\nyour sick and the Bellower may lead you through his gate, and in his\r\nkindness make you to see with his eyes.”\r\n\r\nThis last clause of my ultimatum did not seem to appeal to the priest,\r\nwho argued a while with Marama, though what he said we could not hear.\r\nIn the end he appeared to give way. At any rate Marama called out that\r\nall should be done as we wished, and that meanwhile they prayed us to\r\nintercede with Oro in the cave, and to keep back the ghosts from\r\nhaunting them, and to protect them from misfortune. I replied that we\r\nwould do our best, but could guarantee nothing since their offence was\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\nThen, to show that the conversation was at an end, we walked away with\r\ndignity, pushing Bastin in front of us, lest he should spoil the effect\r\nby some of his ill-timed and often over-true remarks.\r\n\r\n“That’s capital,” said Bickley, when we were out of hearing. “The enemy\r\nhas capitulated. We can stop here as long as we like, provisioned from\r\nthe mainland, and if for any reason we wish to leave, be sure of our\r\nline of retreat.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you call capital,” exclaimed Bastin. “It seems to me\r\nthat all the lies which Arbuthnot has just told are sufficient to bring\r\na judgment upon us. Indeed, I think that I will go back with Marama and\r\nexplain the truth.”\r\n\r\n“I never before knew anybody who was so anxious to be cooked and\r\neaten,” remarked Bickley. “Moreover, you are too late, for the canoe is\r\na hundred yards away by now, and you shan’t have ours. Remember the\r\nPauline maxims, old fellow, which you are so fond of quoting, and be\r\nall things to all men, and another that is more modern, that when you\r\nare at Rome, you must do as the Romans do; also a third, that necessity\r\nhas no law, and for the matter of that, a fourth, that all is fair in\r\nlove and war.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure, Bickley, that Paul never meant his words to bear the\r\ndebased sense which you attribute to them—” began Bastin, but at this\r\npoint I hustled him off to light a fire—a process at which I pointed\r\nout he had shown himself an expert.\r\n\r\nWe slept that night under the overhanging rock just to one side of the\r\ncave, not in the mouth, because of the draught which drew in and out of\r\nthe great place. In that soft and balmy clime this was no hardship,\r\nalthough we lacked blankets. And yet, tired though I was, I could not\r\nrest as I should have done. Bastin snored away contentedly, quite\r\nunaffected by his escape which to him was merely an incident in the\r\nday’s work; and so, too, slumbered Bickley, except that he did not\r\nsnore. But the amazement and the mystery of all that we had discovered\r\nand of all that might be left for us to discover, held me back from\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nWhat did it mean? What could it mean? My nerves were taut as harp\r\nstrings and seemed to vibrate to the touch of invisible fingers,\r\nalthough I could not interpret the music that they made. Once or twice\r\nalso I thought I heard actual music with my physical ears, and that of\r\na strange quality. Soft and low and dreamful, it appeared to well from\r\nthe recesses of the vast cave, a wailing song in an unknown tongue from\r\nthe lips of women, or of a woman, multiplied mysteriously by echoes.\r\nThis, however, must have been pure fancy, since there was no singer\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nPresently I dozed off, to be awakened by the sudden sound of a great\r\nfish leaping in the lake. I sat up and stared, fearing lest it might be\r\nthe splash of a paddle, for I could not put from my mind the\r\npossibility of attack. All I saw, however, was the low line of the\r\ndistant shore, and above it the bright and setting stars that heralded\r\nthe coming of the sun. Then I woke the others, and we washed and ate,\r\nsince once the sun rose time would be precious.\r\n\r\nAt length it appeared, splendid in a cloudless sky, and, as I had\r\nhoped, directly opposite to the mouth of the cave. Taking our candles\r\nand some stout pieces of driftwood which, with our knives, we had\r\nshaped on the previous evening to serve us as levers and rough shovels,\r\nwe entered the cave. Bickley and I were filled with excitement and hope\r\nof what we knew not, but Bastin showed little enthusiasm for our quest.\r\nHis heart was with his half-converted savages beyond the lake, and of\r\nthem, quite rightly I have no doubt, he thought more than he did of all\r\nthe archaeological treasures in the whole earth. Still, he came,\r\nbearing the blackened head of Oro with him which, with unconscious\r\nhumour, he had used as a pillow through the night because, as he said,\r\n“it was after all softer than stone.” Also, I believe that in his heart\r\nhe hoped that he might find an opportunity of destroying the bigger and\r\nearlier edition of Oro in the cave, before it was discovered by the\r\nnatives who might wish to make it an object of worship. Tommy came\r\nalso, with greater alacrity than I expected, since dogs do not as a\r\nrule like dark places. When we reached the statue I learned the reason;\r\nhe remembered the smell he had detected at its base on the previous\r\nday, which Bastin supposed to proceed from a rat, and was anxious to\r\ncontinue his investigations.\r\n\r\nWe went straight to the statue, although Bickley passed the half-buried\r\nmachines with evident regret. As we had hoped, the strong light of the\r\nrising sun fell upon it in a vivid ray, revealing all its wondrous\r\nworkmanship and the majesty—for no other word describes it—of the\r\nsomewhat terrifying countenance that appeared above the wrappings of\r\nthe shroud. Indeed, I was convinced that originally this monument had\r\nbeen placed here in order that on certain days of the year the sun\r\nmight fall upon it thus, when probably worshippers assembled to adore\r\ntheir hallowed symbol. After all, this was common in ancient days:\r\nwitness the instance of the awful Three who sit in the deepest recesses\r\nof the temple of Abu Simbel, on the Nile.\r\n\r\nWe gazed and gazed our fill, at least Bickley and I did, for Bastin was\r\noccupied in making a careful comparison between the head of his wooden\r\nOro and that of the statue.\r\n\r\n“There is no doubt that they are very much alike,” he said. “Why,\r\nwhatever is that dog doing? I think it is going mad,” and he pointed to\r\nTommy who was digging furiously at the base of the lowest step, as at\r\nhome I have seen him do at roots that sheltered a rabbit.\r\n\r\nTommy’s energy was so remarkable that at length it seriously attracted\r\nour attention. Evidently he meant that it should do so, for\r\noccasionally he sprang back to me barking, then returned and sniffed\r\nand scratched. Bickley knelt down and smelt at the stone.\r\n\r\n“It is an odd thing, Humphrey,” he said, “but there is a strange odour\r\nhere, a very pleasant odour like that of sandal-wood or attar of\r\nroses.”\r\n\r\n“I never heard of a rat that smelt like sandal-wood or attar of roses,”\r\nsaid Bastin. “Look out that it isn’t a snake.”\r\n\r\nI knelt down beside Bickley, and in clearing away the deep dust from\r\nwhat seemed to be the bottom of the step, which was perhaps four feet\r\nin height, by accident thrust my amateur spade somewhat strongly\r\nagainst its base where it rested upon the rocky floor.\r\n\r\nNext moment a wonder came to pass. The whole massive rock began to turn\r\noutwards as though upon a pivot! I saw it coming and grabbed Bickley by\r\nthe collar, dragging him back so that we just rolled clear before the\r\ngreat block, which must have weighed several tons, fell down and\r\ncrushed us. Tommy saw it too, and fled, though a little late, for the\r\nedge of the block caught the tip of his tail and caused him to emit a\r\nmost piercing howl. But we did not think of Tommy and his woes; we did\r\nnot think of our own escape or of anything else because of the marvel\r\nthat appeared to us. Seated there upon the ground, after our backward\r\ntumble, we could see into the space which lay behind the fallen step,\r\nfor there the light of the sun penetrated.\r\n\r\nThe first idea it gave me was that of the jewelled shrine of some\r\nmediaeval saint which, by good fortune, had escaped the plunderers;\r\nthere are still such existing in the world. It shone and glittered,\r\napparently with gold and diamonds, although, as a matter of fact, there\r\nwere no diamonds, nor was it gold which gleamed, but some ancient\r\nmetal, or rather amalgam, which is now lost to the world, the same that\r\nwas used in the tubes of the air-machines. I think that it contained\r\ngold, but I do not know. At any rate, it was equally lasting and even\r\nmore beautiful, though lighter in colour.\r\n\r\nFor the rest this adorned recess which resembled that of a large\r\nfuneral vault, occupying the whole space beneath the base of the statue\r\nthat was supported on its arch, was empty save for two flashing objects\r\nthat lay side by side but with nearly the whole width of the vault\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nI pointed at them to Bickley with my finger, for really I could not\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n“Coffins, by Jove!” he whispered. “Glass or crystal coffins and people\r\nin them. Come on!”\r\n\r\nA few seconds later we were crawling into that vault while Bastin,\r\nstill nursing the head of Oro as though it were a baby, stood confused\r\noutside muttering something about desecrating hallowed graves.\r\n\r\nJust as we reached the interior, owing to the heightening of the sun,\r\nthe light passed away, leaving us in a kind of twilight. Bickley\r\nproduced carriage candles from his pocket and fumbled for matches.\r\nWhile he was doing so I noticed two things—firstly, that the place\r\nreally did smell like a scent-shop, and, secondly, that the coffins\r\nseemed to glow with a kind of phosphorescent light of their own, not\r\nvery strong, but sufficient to reveal their outlines in the gloom. Then\r\nthe candles burnt up and we saw.\r\n\r\nWithin the coffin that stood on our left hand as we entered, for this\r\ncrystal was as transparent as plate glass, lay a most wonderful old\r\nman, clad in a gleaming, embroidered robe. His long hair, which was\r\nparted in the middle, as we could see beneath the edge of the\r\npearl-sewn and broidered cap he wore, also his beard were snowy white.\r\nThe man was tall, at least six feet four inches in height, and rather\r\nspare. His hands were long and thin, very delicately made, as were his\r\nsandalled feet.\r\n\r\nBut it was his face that fixed our gaze, for it was marvelous, like the\r\nface of a god, and, as we noticed at once, with some resemblance to\r\nthat of the statue above. Thus the brow was broad and massive, the nose\r\nstraight and long, the mouth stern and clear-cut, while the cheekbones\r\nwere rather high, and the eyebrows arched. Such are the characteristics\r\nof many handsome old men of good blood, and as the mummies of Seti and\r\nothers show us, such they have been for thousands of years. Only this\r\nman differed from all others because of the fearful dignity stamped\r\nupon his features. Looking at him I began to think at once of the\r\nprophet Elijah as he must have appeared rising to heaven, enhanced by\r\nthe more earthly glory of Solomon, for although the appearance of these\r\npatriarchs is unknown, of them one conceives ideas. Only it seemed\r\nprobable that Elijah may have looked more benign. Here there was no\r\nbenignity, only terrible force and infinite wisdom.\r\n\r\nContemplating him I shivered a little and felt thankful that he was\r\ndead. For to tell the truth I was afraid of that awesome countenance\r\nwhich, I should add, was of the whiteness of paper, although the cheeks\r\nstill showed tinges of colour, so perfect was the preservation of the\r\ncorpse.\r\n\r\nI was still gazing at it when Bickley said in a voice of amazement:\r\n\r\n“I say, look here, in the other coffin.”\r\n\r\nI turned, looked, and nearly collapsed on the floor of the vault, since\r\nbeauty can sometimes strike us like a blow. Oh! there before me lay all\r\nloveliness, such loveliness that there burst from my lips an\r\ninvoluntary cry:\r\n\r\n“Alas! that she should be dead!”\r\n\r\nA young woman, I supposed, at least she looked young, perhaps five or\r\nsix and twenty years of age, or so I judged. There she lay, her tall\r\nand delicate shape half hidden in masses of rich-hued hair in colour of\r\na ruddy blackness. I know not how else to describe it, since never have\r\nI seen any of the same tint. Moreover, it shone with a life of its own\r\nas though it had been dusted with gold. From between the masses of this\r\nhair appeared a face which I can only call divine. There was every\r\nbeauty that woman can boast, from the curving eyelashes of\r\nextraordinary length to the sweet and human mouth. To these charms also\r\nwere added a wondrous smile and an air of kind dignity, very different\r\nfrom the fierce pride stamped upon the countenance of the old man who\r\nwas her companion in death.\r\n\r\nShe was clothed in some close-fitting robe of white broidered with\r\ngold; pearls were about her neck, lying far down upon the perfect\r\nbosom, a girdle of gold and shining gems encircled her slender waist,\r\nand on her little feet were sandals fastened with red stones like\r\nrubies. In truth, she was a splendid creature, and yet, I know not how,\r\nher beauty suggested more of the spirit than of the flesh. Indeed, in a\r\nway, it was unearthly. My senses were smitten, it pulled at my\r\nheart-strings, and yet its unutterable strangeness seemed to awake\r\nmemories within me, though of what I could not tell. A wild fancy came\r\nto me that I must have known this heavenly creature in some past life.\r\n\r\nBy now Bastin had joined us, and, attracted by my exclamation and by\r\nthe attitude of Bickley, who was staring down at the coffin with a\r\nfixed look upon his face, not unlike that of a pointer when he scents\r\ngame, he began to contemplate the wonder within it in his slow way.\r\n\r\n“Well, I never!” he said. “Do you think the Glittering Lady in there is\r\nhuman?”\r\n\r\n“The Glittering Lady is dead, but I suppose that she was human in her\r\nlife,” I answered in an awed whisper.\r\n\r\n“Of course she is dead, otherwise she would not be in that glass\r\ncoffin. I think I should like to read the Burial Service over her,\r\nwhich I daresay was never done when she was put in there.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know she is dead?” asked Bickley in a sharp voice and\r\nspeaking for the first time. “I have seen hundreds of corpses, and\r\nmummies too, but never any that looked like these.”\r\n\r\nI stared at him. It was strange to hear Bickley, the scoffer at\r\nmiracles, suggesting that this greatest of all miracles might be\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n“They must have been here a long time,” I said, “for although human,\r\nthey are not, I think, of any people known to the world to-day; their\r\ndress, everything, shows it, though perhaps thousands of years ago—”\r\nand I stopped.\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” answered Bickley; “I agree. That is why I suggest that they\r\nmay have belonged to a race who knew what we do not, namely, how to\r\nsuspend animation for great periods of time.”\r\n\r\nI said no more, nor did Bastin, who was now engaged in studying the old\r\nman, and for once, wonderstruck and overcome. Bickley, however, took\r\none of the candles and began to make a close examination of the\r\ncoffins. So did Tommy, who sniffed along the join of that of the\r\nGlittering Lady until his nose reached a certain spot, where it\r\nremained, while his black tail began to wag in a delighted fashion.\r\nBickley pushed him away and investigated.\r\n\r\n“As I thought,” he said—“air-holes. See!”\r\n\r\nI looked, and there, bored through the crystal of the coffin in a line\r\nwith the face of its occupant, were a number of little holes that\r\neither by accident or design outlined the shape of a human mouth.\r\n\r\n“They are not airtight,” murmured Bickley; “and if air can enter, how\r\ncan dead flesh remain like that for ages?”\r\n\r\nThen he continued his search upon the other side.\r\n\r\n“The lid of this coffin works on hinges,” he said. “Here they are,\r\nfashioned of the crystal itself. A living person within could have\r\npulled it down before the senses departed.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I answered; “for look, here is a crystal bolt at the end and it\r\nis shot from without.”\r\n\r\nThis puzzled him; then as though struck by an idea, he began to examine\r\nthe other coffin.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got it!” he exclaimed presently. “The old god in here” (somehow\r\nwe all thought of this old man as not quite normal) “shut down the\r\nGlittering Lady’s coffin and bolted it. His own is not bolted, although\r\nthe bolt exists in the same place. He just got in and pulled down the\r\nlid. Oh! what nonsense I am talking—for how can such things be? Let us\r\nget out and think.”\r\n\r\nSo we crept from the sepulchre in which the perfumed air had begun to\r\noppress us and sat ourselves down upon the floor of the cave, where for\r\na while we remained silent.\r\n\r\n“I am very thirsty,” said Bastin presently. “Those smells seem to have\r\ndried me up. I am going to get some tea—I mean water, as unfortunately\r\nthere is no tea,” and he set off towards the mouth of the cave.\r\n\r\nWe followed him, I don’t quite know why, except that we wished to\r\nbreathe freely outside, also we knew that the sepulchre and its\r\ncontents would be as safe as they had been for—well, how long?\r\n\r\nIt proved to be a beautiful morning outside. We walked up and down\r\nenjoying it sub-consciously, for really our—that is Bickley’s and my\r\nown—intelligences were concentrated on that sepulchre and its contents.\r\nWhere Bastin’s may have been I do not know, perhaps in a visionary\r\nteapot, since I was sure that it would take him a day or two to\r\nappreciate the significance of our discoveries. At any rate, he\r\nwandered off, making no remarks about them, to drink water, I suppose.\r\n\r\nPresently he began to shout to us from the end of the table-rock and we\r\nwent to see the reason of his noise. It proved to be very satisfactory,\r\nfor while we were in the cave the Orofenans had brought absolutely\r\neverything belonging to us, together with a large supply of food from\r\nthe main island. Not a single article was missing; even our books, a\r\ncan with the bottom out, and the broken pieces of a little pocket\r\nmirror had been religiously transported, and with these a few articles\r\nthat had been stolen from us, notably my pocket-knife. Evidently a\r\ngreat taboo had been laid upon all our possessions. They were now\r\ncarefully arranged in one of the grooves of the rock that Bickley\r\nsupposed had been made by the wheels of aeroplanes, which was why we\r\nhad not seen them at once.\r\n\r\nEach of us rushed for what we desired most—Bastin for one of the\r\ncanisters of tea, I for my diaries, and Bickley for his chest of\r\ninstruments and medicines. These were removed to the mouth of the cave,\r\nand after them the other things and the food; also a bell tent and some\r\ncamp furniture that we had brought from the ship. Then Bastin made some\r\ntea of which he drank four large pannikins, having first said grace\r\nover it with unwonted fervour. Nor did we disdain our share of the\r\nbeverage, although Bickley preferred cocoa and I coffee. Cocoa and\r\ncoffee we had no time to make then, and in view of that sepulchre in\r\nthe cave, what had we to do with cocoa and coffee?\r\n\r\nSo Bickley and I said to each other, and yet presently he changed his\r\nmind and in a special metal machine carefully made some extremely\r\nstrong black coffee which he poured into a thermos flask, previously\r\nwarmed with hot water, adding thereto about a claret glass of brandy.\r\nAlso he extracted certain drugs from his medicine-chest, and with them,\r\nas I noted, a hypodermic syringe, which he first boiled in a kettle and\r\nthen shut up in a little tube with a glass stopper.\r\n\r\nThese preparations finished, he called to Tommy to give him the scraps\r\nof our meal. But there was no Tommy. The dog was missing, and though we\r\nhunted everywhere we could not find him. Finally we concluded that he\r\nhad wandered off down the beach on business of his own and would return\r\nin due course. We could not bother about Tommy just then.\r\n\r\nAfter making some further preparations and fidgeting about a little,\r\nBickley announced that as we had now some proper paraffin lamps of the\r\npowerful sort which are known as “hurricane,” he proposed by their aid\r\nto carry out further examinations in the cave.\r\n\r\n“I think I shall stop where I am,” said Bastin, helping himself from\r\nthe kettle to a fifth pannikin of tea. “Those corpses are very\r\ninteresting, but I don’t see any use in staring at them again at\r\npresent. One can always do that at any time. I have missed Marama once\r\nalready by being away in that cave, and I have a lot to say to him\r\nabout my people; I don’t want to be absent in case he should return.”\r\n\r\n“To wash up the things, I suppose,” said Bickley with a sniff; “or\r\nperhaps to eat the tea-leaves.”\r\n\r\n“Well, as a matter of fact, I have noticed that these natives have a\r\npeculiar taste for tea-leaves. I think they believe them to be a\r\nmedicine, but I don’t suppose they would come so far for them, though\r\nperhaps they might in the hope of getting the head of Oro. Anyhow, I am\r\ngoing to stop here.”\r\n\r\n“Pray do,” said Bickley. “Are you ready, Humphrey?”\r\n\r\nI nodded, and he handed to me a felt-covered flask of the\r\nnon-conducting kind, filled with boiling water, a tin of preserved\r\nmilk, and a little bottle of meat extract of a most concentrated sort.\r\nThen, having lit two of the hurricane lamps and seen that they were\r\nfull of oil, we started back up the cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nResurrection\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reached the sepulchre without stopping to look at the parked\r\nmachines or even the marvelous statue that stood above it, for what did\r\nwe care about machines or statues now? As we approached we were\r\nastonished to hear low and cavernous growlings.\r\n\r\n“There is some wild beast in there,” said Bickley, halting. “No, by\r\nGeorge! it’s Tommy. What can the dog be after?”\r\n\r\nWe peeped in, and there sure enough was Tommy lying on the top of the\r\nGlittering Lady’s coffin and growling his very best with the hair\r\nstanding up upon his back. When he saw who it was, however, he jumped\r\noff and frisked round, licking my hand.\r\n\r\n“That’s very strange,” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Not stranger than everything else,” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Open these coffins,” he answered, “beginning with that of the old god,\r\nsince I would rather experiment on him. I expect he will crumble into\r\ndust. But if by chance he doesn’t I’ll jam a little strychnine, mixed\r\nwith some other drugs, of which you don’t know the names, into one of\r\nhis veins and see if anything happens. If it doesn’t, it won’t hurt\r\nhim, and if it does—well, who knows? Now give me a hand.”\r\n\r\nWe went to the left-hand coffin and by inserting the hook on the back\r\nof my knife, of which the real use is to pick stones out of horses’\r\nhoofs, into one of the little air-holes I have described, managed to\r\nraise the heavy crystal lid sufficiently to enable us to force a piece\r\nof wood between it and the top. The rest was easy, for the hinges being\r\nof crystal had not corroded. In two minutes it was open.\r\n\r\nFrom the chest came an overpowering spicy odour, and with it a\r\nveritable breath of warm air before which we recoiled a little. Bickley\r\ntook a pocket thermometer which he had at hand and glanced at it. It\r\nmarked a temperature of 82 degrees in the sepulchre. Having noted this,\r\nhe thrust it into the coffin between the crystal wall and its occupant.\r\nThen we went out and waited a little while to give the odours time to\r\ndissipate, for they made the head reel.\r\n\r\nAfter five minutes or so we returned and examined the thermometer. It\r\nhad risen to 98 degrees, the natural temperature of the human body.\r\n\r\n“What do you make of that if the man is dead?” he whispered.\r\n\r\nI shook my head, and as we had agreed, set to helping him to lift the\r\nbody from the coffin. It was a good weight, quite eleven stone I should\r\nsay; moreover, _it was not stiff_, for the hip joints bent. We got it\r\nout and laid it on a blanket we had spread on the floor of the\r\nsepulchre. Whilst I was thus engaged I saw something that nearly caused\r\nme to loose my hold from astonishment. Beneath the head, the centre of\r\nthe back and the feet were crystal boxes about eight inches square, or\r\nrather crystal blocks, for in them I could see no opening, and these\r\nboxes emitted a faint phosphorescent light. I touched one of them and\r\nfound that it was quite warm.\r\n\r\n“Great heavens!” I exclaimed, “here’s magic.”\r\n\r\n“There’s no such thing,” answered Bickley in his usual formula. Then an\r\nexplanation seemed to strike him and he added, “Not magic but radium or\r\nsomething of the sort. That’s how the temperature was kept up. In\r\nsufficient quantity it is practically indestructible, you see. My word!\r\nthis old gentleman knew a thing or two.”\r\n\r\nAgain we waited a little while to see if the body begun to crumble on\r\nexposure to the air, I taking the opportunity to make a rough sketch of\r\nit in my pocket-book in anticipation of that event. But it did not; it\r\nremained quite sound.\r\n\r\n“Here goes,” said Bickley. “If he should be alive, he will catch cold\r\nin his lungs after lying for ages in that baby incubator, as I suppose\r\nhe has done. So it is now or never.”\r\n\r\nThen bidding me hold the man’s right arm, he took the sterilized\r\nsyringe which he had prepared, and thrusting the needle into a vein he\r\nselected just above the wrist, injected the contents.\r\n\r\n“It would have been better over the heart,” he whispered, “but I\r\nthought I would try the arm first. I don’t like risking chills by\r\nuncovering him.”\r\n\r\nI made no answer and again we waited and watched.\r\n\r\n“Great heavens, he’s stirring!” I gasped presently.\r\n\r\nStirring he was, for his fingers began to move.\r\n\r\nBickley bent down and placed his ear to the heart—I forgot to say that\r\nhe had tested this before with a stethoscope, but had been unable to\r\ndetect any movement.\r\n\r\n“I believe it is beginning to beat,” he said in an awed voice.\r\n\r\nThen he applied the stethoscope, and added, “It is, it is!”\r\n\r\nNext he took a filament of cotton wool and laid it on the man’s lips.\r\nPresently it moved; he was breathing, though very faintly. Bickley took\r\nmore cotton wool and having poured something from his medicine-chest on\r\nto it, placed it over the mouth beneath the man’s nostrils—I believe it\r\nwas sal volatile.\r\n\r\nNothing further happened for a little while, and to relieve the strain\r\non my mind I stared absently into the empty coffin. Here I saw what had\r\nescaped our notice, two small plates of white metal and cut upon them\r\nwhat I took to be star maps. Beyond these and the glowing boxes which I\r\nhave mentioned, there was nothing else in the coffin. I had no time to\r\nexamine them, for at that moment the old man opened his mouth and began\r\nto breathe, evidently with some discomfort and effort, as his empty\r\nlungs filled themselves with air. Then his eyelids lifted, revealing a\r\nwonderful pair of dark glowing eyes beneath. Next he tried to sit up\r\nbut would have fallen, had not Bickley supported him with his arm.\r\n\r\nI do not think he saw Bickley, indeed he shut his eyes again as though\r\nthe light hurt them, and went into a kind of faint. Then it was that\r\nTommy, who all this while had been watching the proceedings with grave\r\ninterest, came forward, wagging his tail, and licked the man’s face. At\r\nthe touch of the dog’s red tongue, he opened his eyes for the second\r\ntime. Now he saw—not us but Tommy, for after contemplating him for a\r\nfew seconds, something like a smile appeared upon his fierce but noble\r\nface. More, he lifted his hand and laid it on the dog’s head, as though\r\nto pat it kindly. Half a minute or so later his awakening senses\r\nappreciated our presence. The incipient smile vanished and was replaced\r\nby a somewhat terrible frown.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bickley had poured out some of the hot coffee laced with\r\nbrandy into the cup that was screwed on the top of the thermos flask.\r\nAdvancing to the man whom I supported, he put it to his lips. He tasted\r\nand made a wry face, but presently he began to sip, and ultimately\r\nswallowed it all. The effect of the stimulant was wonderful, for in a\r\nfew minutes he came to life completely and was even able to sit up\r\nwithout support.\r\n\r\nFor quite a long while he gazed at us gravely, taking us in and\r\neverything connected with us. For instance, Bickley’s medicine-case\r\nwhich lay open showing the little vulcanite tubes, a few instruments\r\nand other outfit, engaged his particular attention, and I saw at once\r\nthat he understood what it was. Thus his arm still smarted where the\r\nneedle had been driven in and on the blanket lay the syringe. He looked\r\nat his arm, then looked at the syringe, and nodded. The paraffin\r\nhurricane lamps also seemed to interest and win his approval. We two\r\nmen, as I thought, attracted him least of all; he just summed us up and\r\nour garments, more especially the garments, with a few shrewd glances,\r\nand then seemed to turn his thoughts to Tommy, who had seated himself\r\nquite contentedly at his side, evidently accepting him as a new\r\naddition to our party.\r\n\r\nI confess that this behaviour on Tommy’s part reassured me not a\r\nlittle. I am a great believer in the instincts of animals, especially\r\nof dogs, and I felt certain that if this man had not been in all\r\nessentials human like ourselves, Tommy would not have tolerated him. In\r\nthe same way the sleeper’s clear liking for Tommy, at whom he looked\r\nmuch oftener and with greater kindness than he did at us, suggested\r\nthat there was goodness in him somewhere, since although a dog in its\r\nwonderful tolerance may love a bad person in whom it smells out hidden\r\nvirtue, no really bad person ever loved a dog, or, I may add, a child\r\nor a flower.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the “old god,” as we had christened him while he\r\nwas in his coffin, during all our association with him, cared\r\ninfinitely more for Tommy than he did for any of us, a circumstance\r\nthat ultimately was not without its influence upon our fortunes. But\r\nfor this there was a reason as we learned afterwards, also he was not\r\nreally so amiable as I hoped.\r\n\r\nWhen we had looked at each other for a long while the sleeper began to\r\narrange his beard, of which the length seemed to surprise him,\r\nespecially as Tommy was seated on one end of it. Finding this out and\r\napparently not wishing to disturb Tommy, he gave up the occupation, and\r\nafter one or two attempts, for his tongue and lips still seemed to be\r\nstiff, addressed us in some sonorous and musical language, unlike any\r\nthat we had ever heard. We shook our heads. Then by an afterthought I\r\nsaid “Good day” to him in the language of the Orofenans. He puzzled\r\nover the word as though it were more or less familiar to him, and when\r\nI repeated it, gave it back to me with a difference indeed, but in a\r\nway which convinced us that he quite understood what I meant. The\r\nconversation went no further at the moment because just then some\r\nmemory seemed to strike him.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting with his back against the coffin of the Glittering Lady,\r\nwhom therefore he had not seen. Now he began to turn round, and being\r\ntoo weak to do so, motioned me to help him. I obeyed, while Bickley,\r\nguessing his purpose, held up one of the hurricane lamps that he might\r\nsee better. With a kind of fierce eagerness he surveyed her who lay\r\nwithin the coffin, and after he had done so, uttered a sigh as of\r\nintense relief.\r\n\r\nNext he pointed to the metal cup out of which he had drunk. Bickley\r\nfilled it again from the thermos flask, which I observed excited his\r\nkeen interest, for, having touched the flask with his hand and found\r\nthat it was cool, he appeared to marvel that the fluid coming from it\r\nshould be hot and steaming. Presently he smiled as though he had got\r\nthe clue to the mystery, and swallowed his second drink of coffee and\r\nspirit. This done, he motioned to us to lift the lid of the lady’s\r\ncoffin, pointing out a certain catch in the bolts which at first we\r\ncould not master, for it will be remembered that on this coffin these\r\nwere shot.\r\n\r\nIn the end, by pursuing the same methods that we had used in the\r\ninstance of his own, we raised the coffin lid and once more were driven\r\nto retreat from the sepulchre for a while by the overpowering odour\r\nlike to that of a whole greenhouse full of tuberoses, that flowed out\r\nof it, inducing a kind of stupefaction from which even Tommy fled.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned it was to find the man kneeling by the side of the\r\ncoffin, for as yet he could not stand, with his glowing eyes fixed upon\r\nthe face of her who slept therein and waving his long arms above her.\r\n\r\n“Hypnotic business! Wonder if it will work,” whispered Bickley. Then he\r\nlifted the syringe and looked inquiringly at the man, who shook his\r\nhead, and went on with his mesmeric passes.\r\n\r\nI crept round him and took my stand by the sleeper’s head, that I might\r\nwatch her face, which was well worth watching, while Bickley, with his\r\nmedicine at hand, remained near her feet, I think engaged in\r\ndisinfecting the syringe in some spirit or acid. I believe he was about\r\nto make an attempt to use it when suddenly, as though beneath the\r\ninfluence of the hypnotic passes, a change appeared on the Glittering\r\nLady’s face. Hitherto, beautiful as it was, it had been a dead face\r\nthough one of a person who had suddenly been cut off while in full\r\nhealth and vigour a few hours, or at the most a day or so before. Now\r\nit began to live again; it was as though the spirit were returning from\r\nafar, and not without toil and tribulation.\r\n\r\nExpression after expression flitted across the features; indeed these\r\nseemed to change so much from moment to moment that they might have\r\nbelonged to several different individuals, though each was beautiful.\r\nThe fact of these remarkable changes with the suggestion of multiform\r\npersonalities which they conveyed impressed both Bickley and myself\r\nvery much indeed. Then the breast heaved tumultuously; it even appeared\r\nto struggle. Next the eyes opened. They were full of wonder, even of\r\nfear, but oh! what marvelous eyes. I do not know how to describe them,\r\nI cannot even state their exact colour, except that it was dark,\r\nsomething like the blue of sapphires of the deepest tint, and yet not\r\nblack; large, too, and soft as a deer’s. They shut again as though the\r\nlight hurt them, then once more opened and wandered about, apparently\r\nwithout seeing.\r\n\r\nAt length they found my face, for I was still bending over her, and,\r\nresting there, appeared to take it in by degrees. More, it seemed to\r\ntouch and stir some human spring in the still-sleeping heart. At least\r\nthe fear passed from her features and was replaced by a faint smile,\r\nsuch as a patient sometimes gives to one known and well loved, as the\r\neffects of chloroform pass away. For a while she looked at me with an\r\nearnest, searching gaze, then suddenly, for the first time moving her\r\narms, lifted them and threw them round my neck.\r\n\r\nThe old man stared, bending his imperial brows into a little frown, but\r\ndid nothing. Bickley stared also through his glasses and sniffed as\r\nthough in disapproval, while I remained quite still, fighting with a\r\nwild impulse to kiss her on the lips as one would an awakening and\r\nbeloved child. I doubt if I could have done so, however, for really I\r\nwas immovable; my heart seemed to stop and all my muscles to be\r\nparalysed.\r\n\r\nI do not know for how long this endured, but I do know how it ended.\r\nPresently in the intense silence I heard Bastin’s heavy voice and\r\nlooking round, saw his big head projecting into the sepulchre.\r\n\r\n“Well, I never!” he said, “you seem to have woke them up with a\r\nvengeance. If you begin like _that_ with the lady, there will be\r\ncomplications before you have done, Arbuthnot.”\r\n\r\nTalk of being brought back to earth with a rush! I could have killed\r\nBastin, and Bickley, turning on him like a tiger, told him to be off,\r\nfind wood and light a large fire in front of the statue. I think he was\r\nabout to argue when the Ancient gave him a glance of his fierce eyes,\r\nwhich alarmed him, and he departed, bewildered, to return presently\r\nwith the wood.\r\n\r\nBut the sound of his voice had broken the spell. The Lady let her arms\r\nfall with a start, and shut her eyes again, seeming to faint. Bickley\r\nsprang forward with his sal volatile and applied it to her nostrils,\r\nthe Ancient not interfering, for he seemed to recognise that he had to\r\ndeal with a man of skill and one who meant well by them.\r\n\r\nIn the end we brought her round again and, to omit details, Bickley\r\ngave her, not coffee and brandy, but a mixture he compounded of hot\r\nwater, preserved milk and meat essence. The effect of it on her was\r\nwonderful, since a few minutes after swallowing it she sat up in the\r\ncoffin. Then we lifted her from that narrow bed in which she had slept\r\nfor—ah! how long? and perceived that beneath her also were crystal\r\nboxes of the radiant, heat-giving substance. We sat her on the floor of\r\nthe sepulchre, wrapping her also in a blanket.\r\n\r\nNow it was that Tommy, after frisking round her as though in welcome of\r\nan old friend, calmly established himself beside her and laid his black\r\nhead upon her knee. She noted it and smiled for the first time, a\r\nmarvelously sweet and gentle smile. More, she placed her slender hand\r\nupon the dog and stroked him feebly.\r\n\r\nBickley tried to make her drink some more of his mixture, but she\r\nrefused, motioning him to give it to Tommy. This, however, he would not\r\ndo because there was but one cup. Presently both of the sleepers began\r\nto shiver, which caused Bickley anxiety. Abusing Bastin beneath his\r\nbreath for being so long with the fire, he drew the blankets closer\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nThen an idea came to him and he examined the glowing boxes in the\r\ncoffin. They were loose, being merely set in prepared cavities in the\r\ncrystal. Wrapping our handkerchiefs about his hand, he took them out\r\nand placed them around the wakened patients, a proceeding of which the\r\nAncient nodded approval. Just then, too, Bastin returned with his first\r\nload of firewood, and soon we had a merry blaze going just outside the\r\nsepulchre. I saw that they observed the lighting of this fire by means\r\nof a match with much interest.\r\n\r\nNow they grew warm again, as indeed we did also—too warm. Then in my\r\nturn I had an idea. I knew that by now the sun would be beating hotly\r\nagainst the rock of the mount, and suggested to Bickley, that, if\r\npossible, the best thing we could do would be to get them into its\r\nlife-giving rays. He agreed, if we could make them understand and they\r\nwere able to walk. So I tried. First I directed the Ancient’s attention\r\nto the mouth of the cave which at this distance showed as a white\r\ncircle of light. He looked at it and then at me with grave inquiry. I\r\nmade motions to suggest that he should proceed there, repeating the\r\nword “Sun” in the Orofenan tongue. He understood at once, though\r\nwhether he read my mind rather than what I said I am not sure.\r\nApparently the Glittering Lady understood also and seemed to be most\r\nanxious to go. Only she looked rather pitifully at her feet and shook\r\nher head. This decided me.\r\n\r\nI do not know if I have mentioned anywhere that I am a tall man and\r\nvery muscular. She was tall, also, but as I judged not so very heavy\r\nafter her long fast. At any rate I felt quite certain that I could\r\ncarry her for that distance. Stooping down, I lifted her up, signing to\r\nher to put her arms round my neck, which she did. Then calling to\r\nBickley and Bastin to bring along the Ancient between them, with some\r\ndifficulty I struggled out of the sepulchre, and started down the cave.\r\nShe was more heavy than I thought, and yet I could have wished the\r\njourney longer. To begin with she seemed quite trustful and happy in my\r\narms, where she lay with her head against my shoulder, smiling a little\r\nas a child might do, especially when I had to stop and throw her long\r\nhair round my neck like a muffler, to prevent it from trailing in the\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nA bundle of lavender, or a truss of new-mown hay, could not have been\r\nmore sweet to carry and there was something electric about the touch of\r\nher, which went through and through me. Very soon it was over, and we\r\nwere out of the cave into the full glory of the tropical sun. At first,\r\nthat her eyes might become accustomed to its light and her awakened\r\nbody to its heat, I set her down where shadow fell from the overhanging\r\nrock, in a canvas deck chair that had been brought by Marama with the\r\nother things, throwing the rug about her to protect her from such wind\r\nas there was. She nestled gratefully into the soft seat and shut her\r\neyes, for the motion had tired her. I noted, however, that she drew in\r\nthe sweet air with long breaths.\r\n\r\nThen I turned to observe the arrival of the Ancient, who was being\r\nborne between Bickley and Bastin in what children know as a\r\ndandy-chair, which is formed by two people crossing their hands in a\r\npeculiar fashion. It says much for the tremendous dignity of his\r\npresence that even thus, with one arm round the neck of Bickley and the\r\nother round that of Bastin, and his long white beard falling almost to\r\nthe ground, he still looked most imposing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, just as they were emerging from the cave,\r\nBastin, always the most awkward of creatures, managed to leave hold\r\nwith one hand, so that his passenger nearly came to the ground. Never\r\nshall I forget the look that he gave him. Indeed, I think that from\r\nthis moment he hated Bastin. Bickley he respected as a man of\r\nintelligence and learning, although in comparison with his own, the\r\nlatter was infantile and crude; me he tolerated and even liked; but\r\nBastin he detested. The only one of our party for whom he felt anything\r\napproaching real affection was the spaniel Tommy.\r\n\r\nWe set him down, fortunately uninjured, on some rugs, and also in the\r\nshadow. Then, after a little while, we moved both of them into the sun.\r\nIt was quite curious to see them expand there. As Bickley said, what\r\nhappened to them might well be compared to the development of a\r\nbutterfly which has just broken from the living grave of its chrysalis\r\nand crept into the full, hot radiance of the light. Its crinkled wings\r\nunfold, their brilliant tints develop; in an hour or two it is perfect,\r\nglorious, prepared for life and flight, a new creature.\r\n\r\nSo it was with this pair, from moment to moment they gathered strength\r\nand vigour. Near-by to them, as it happened, stood a large basket of\r\nthe luscious native fruits brought that morning by the Orofenans, and\r\nat these the Lady looked with longing. With Bickley’s permission, I\r\noffered them to her and to the Ancient, first peeling them with my\r\nfingers. They ate of them greedily, a full meal, and would have gone on\r\nhad not the stern Bickley, fearing untoward consequences, removed the\r\nbasket. Again the results were wonderful, for half an hour afterwards\r\nthey seemed to be quite strong. With my assistance the Glittering Lady,\r\nas I still call her, for at that time I did not know her name, rose\r\nfrom the chair, and, leaning on me, tottered a few steps forward. Then\r\nshe stood looking at the sky and all the lovely panorama of nature\r\nbeneath, and stretching out her arms as though in worship. Oh! how\r\nbeautiful she seemed with the sunlight shining on her heavenly face!\r\n\r\nNow for the first time I heard her voice. It was soft and deep, yet in\r\nit was a curious bell-like tone that seemed to vibrate like the sound\r\nof chimes heard from far away. Never have I listened to such another\r\nvoice. She pointed to the sun whereof the light turned her radiant hair\r\nand garments to a kind of golden glory, and called it by some name that\r\nI could not understand. I shook my head, whereon she gave it a\r\ndifferent name taken, I suppose, from another language. Again I shook\r\nmy head and she tried a third time. To my delight this word was\r\npractically the same that the Orofenans used for “sun.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, speaking very slowly, “so it is called by the people of\r\nthis land.”\r\n\r\nShe understood, for she answered in much the same language:\r\n\r\n“What, then, do you call it?”\r\n\r\n“Sun in the English tongue,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Sun. English,” she repeated after me, then added, “How are you named,\r\nWanderer?”\r\n\r\n“Humphrey,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Hum-fe-ry!” she said as though she were learning the word, “and\r\nthose?”\r\n\r\n“Bastin and Bickley,” I replied.\r\n\r\nOver these patronymics she shook her head; as yet they were too much\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\n“How are you named, Sleeper?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Yva,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“A beautiful name for one who is beautiful,” I declared with\r\nenthusiasm, of course always in the rich Orofenan dialect which by now\r\nI could talk well enough.\r\n\r\nShe repeated the words once or twice, then of a sudden caught their\r\nmeaning, for she smiled and even coloured, saying hastily with a wave\r\nof her hand towards the Ancient who stood at a distance between Bastin\r\nand Bickley, “My father, Oro; great man; great king; great god!”\r\n\r\nAt this information I started, for it was startling to learn that here\r\nwas the original Oro, who was still worshipped by the Orofenans,\r\nalthough of his actual existence they had known nothing for uncounted\r\ntime. Also I was glad to learn that he was her father and not her old\r\nhusband, for to me that would have been horrible, a desecration too\r\ndeep for words.\r\n\r\n“How long did you sleep, Yva?” I asked, pointing towards the sepulchre\r\nin the cave.\r\n\r\nAfter a little thought she understood and shook her head hopelessly,\r\nthen by an afterthought, she said,\r\n\r\n“Stars tell Oro to-night.”\r\n\r\nSo Oro was an astronomer as well as a king and a god. I had guessed as\r\nmuch from those plates in the coffin which seemed to have stars\r\nengraved on them.\r\n\r\nAt this point our conversation came to an end, for the Ancient himself\r\napproached, leaning on the arm of Bickley who was engaged in an\r\nanimated argument with Bastin.\r\n\r\n“For Heaven’s sake!” said Bickley, “keep your theology to yourself at\r\npresent. If you upset the old fellow and put him in a temper he may\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\n“If a man tells me that he is a god it is my duty to tell him that he\r\nis a liar,” replied Bastin obstinately.\r\n\r\n“Which you did, Bastin, only fortunately he did not understand you. But\r\nfor your own sake I advise you not to take liberties. He is not one, I\r\nthink, with whom it is wise to trifle. I think he seems thirsty. Go and\r\nget some water from the rain pool, not from the lake.”\r\n\r\nBastin departed and presently returned with an aluminum jug full of\r\npure water and a glass. Bickley poured some of it into a glass and\r\nhanded it to Yva who bent her head in thanks. Then she did a curious\r\nthing. Having first lifted the glass with both hands to the sky and\r\nheld it so for a few seconds, she turned and with an obeisance poured a\r\nlittle of it on the ground before her father’s feet.\r\n\r\nA libation, thought I to myself, and evidently Bastin agreed with me,\r\nfor I heard him mutter,\r\n\r\n“I believe she is making a heathen offering.”\r\n\r\nDoubtless we were right, for Oro accepted the homage by a little motion\r\nof the head. After this, at a sign from him she drank the water. Then\r\nthe glass was refilled and handed to Oro who also held it towards the\r\nsky. He, however, made no libation but drank at once, two tumblers of\r\nit in rapid succession.\r\n\r\nBy now the direct sunlight was passing from the mouth of the cave, and\r\nthough it was hot enough, both of them shivered a little. They spoke\r\ntogether in some language of which we could not understand a word, as\r\nthough they were debating what their course of action should be. The\r\ndispute was long and earnest. Had we known what was passing, which I\r\nlearned afterwards, it would have made us sufficiently anxious, for the\r\npoint at issue was nothing less than whether we should or should not be\r\nforthwith destroyed—an end, it appears, that Oro was quite capable of\r\nbringing about if he so pleased. Yva, however, had very clear views of\r\nher own on the matter and, as I gather, even dared to threaten that she\r\nwould protect us by the use of certain powers at her command, though\r\nwhat these were I do not know.\r\n\r\nWhile the event hung doubtful Tommy, who was growing bored with these\r\nlong proceedings, picked up a bough still covered with flowers which,\r\nafter their pretty fashion, the Orofenans had placed on the top of one\r\nof the baskets of food. This small bough he brought and laid at the\r\nfeet of Oro, no doubt in the hope that he would throw it for him to\r\nfetch, a game in which the dog delighted. For some reason Oro saw an\r\nomen in this simple canine performance, or he may have thought that the\r\ndog was making an offering to him, for he put his thin hand to his brow\r\nand thought a while, then motioned to Bastin to pick up the bough and\r\ngive it to him.\r\n\r\nNext he spoke to his daughter as though assenting to something, for I\r\nsaw her sigh in relief. No wonder, for he was conveying his decision to\r\nspare our lives and admit us to their fellowship.\r\n\r\nAfter this again they talked, but in quite a different tone and manner.\r\nThen the Glittering Lady said to me in her slow and archaic Orofenan:\r\n\r\n“We go to rest. You must not follow. We come back perhaps tonight,\r\nperhaps next night. We are quite safe. You are quite safe under the\r\nbeard of Oro. Spirit of Oro watch you. You understand?”\r\n\r\nI said I understood, whereon she answered:\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, O Humfe-ry.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, O Yva,” I replied, bowing.\r\n\r\nThereon they turned and refusing all assistance from us, vanished into\r\nthe darkness of the cave leaning upon each other and walking slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTwo Hundred and Fifty Thousand Years!\r\n\r\n\r\n“You seem to have made the best of your time, old fellow,” said Bickley\r\nin rather a sour voice.\r\n\r\n“I never knew people begin to call each other by their Christian names\r\nso soon,” added Bastin, looking at me with a suspicious eye.\r\n\r\n“I know no other,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not, but at any rate _you_ have another, though you don’t seem\r\nto have told it to her. Anyway, I am glad they are gone, for I was\r\ngetting tired of being ordered by everybody to carry about wood and\r\nwater for them. Also I am terribly hungry as I can’t eat before it is\r\nlight. They have taken most of the best fruit to which I was looking\r\nforward, but thank goodness they do not seem to care for pork.”\r\n\r\n“So am I,” said Bickley, who really looked exhausted. “Get the food,\r\nthere’s a good fellow. We’ll talk afterwards.”\r\n\r\nWhen we had eaten, somewhat silently, I asked Bickley what he made of\r\nthe business; also whither he thought the sleepers had gone.\r\n\r\n“I think I can answer the last question,” interrupted Bastin. “I expect\r\nit is to a place well known to students of the Bible which even Bickley\r\nmentions sometimes when he is angry. At any rate, they seem to be very\r\nfond of heat, for they wouldn’t part from it even in their coffins, and\r\nyou will admit that they are not quite natural, although that\r\nGlittering Lady is so attractive as regards her exterior.”\r\n\r\nBickley waved these remarks aside and addressed himself to me.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what to think of it,” he said; “but as the experience is\r\nnot natural and everything in the Universe, so far as we know it, has a\r\nnatural explanation, I am inclined to the belief that we are suffering\r\nfrom hallucinations, which in their way are also quite natural. It does\r\nnot seem possible that two people can really have been asleep for an\r\nunknown length of time enclosed in vessels of glass or crystal, kept\r\nwarm by radium or some such substance, and then emerge from them\r\ncomparatively strong and well. It is contrary to natural law.”\r\n\r\n“How about microbes?” I asked. “They are said to last practically for\r\never, and they are living things. So in their case your natural law\r\nbreaks down.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” he answered. “Some microbes in a sealed tube and under\r\ncertain conditions do appear to possess indefinite powers of life. Also\r\nradium has an indefinite life, but that is a mineral. Only these people\r\nare not microbes nor are they minerals. Also, experience tells us that\r\nthey could not have lived for more than a few months at the outside in\r\nsuch circumstances as we seemed to find them.”\r\n\r\n“Then what do you suggest?”\r\n\r\n“I suggest that we did not really find them at all; that we have all\r\nbeen dreaming. You know that there are certain gases which produce\r\nillusions, laughing gas is one of them, and that these gases are\r\nsometimes met with in caves. Now there were very peculiar odours in\r\nthat place under the statue, which may have worked upon our\r\nimaginations in some such way. Otherwise we are up against a miracle,\r\nand, as you know, I do not believe in miracles.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ do,” said Bastin calmly. “You’ll find all about it in the Bible if\r\nyou will only take the trouble to read. Why do you talk such rubbish\r\nabout gases?”\r\n\r\n“Because only gas, or something of the sort, could have made us imagine\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, Bickley! Those people were here right enough. Didn’t they\r\neat our fruit and drink the water I brought them without ever saying\r\nthank you? Only, they are not human. They are evil spirits, and for my\r\npart I don’t want to see any more of them, though I have no doubt\r\nArbuthnot does, as that Glittering Lady threw her arms round his neck\r\nwhen she woke up, and already he is calling her by her Christian name,\r\nif the word Christian can be used in connection with her. The old\r\nfellow had the impudence to tell us that he was a god, and it is\r\nremarkable that he should have called himself Oro, seeing that the\r\ndevil they worship on the island is also called Oro and the place\r\nitself is named Orofena.”\r\n\r\n“As to where they have gone,” continued Bickley, taking no notice of\r\nBastin, “I really don’t know. My expectation is, however, that when we\r\ngo to look tomorrow morning—and I suggest that we should not do so\r\nbefore then in order that we may give our minds time to clear—we shall\r\nfind that sepulchre place quite empty, even perhaps without the crystal\r\ncoffins we have imagined to stand there.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we shall find that there isn’t a cave at all and that we are\r\nnot sitting on a flat rock outside of it,” suggested Bastin with heavy\r\nsarcasm, adding, “You are clever in your way, Bickley, but you can talk\r\nmore rubbish than any man I ever knew.”\r\n\r\n“They told us they would come back tonight or tomorrow,” I said. “If\r\nthey do, what will you say then, Bickley?”\r\n\r\n“I will wait till they come to answer that question. Now let us go for\r\na walk and try to change our thoughts. We are all over-strained and\r\nscarcely know what we are saying.”\r\n\r\n“One more question,” I said as we rose to start. “Did Tommy suffer from\r\nhallucinations as well as ourselves?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” answered Bickley. “He is an animal just as we are, or\r\nperhaps we thought we saw Tommy do the things he did.”\r\n\r\n“When you found that basket of fruit, Bastin, which the natives brought\r\nover in the canoe, was there a bough covered with red flowers lying on\r\nthe top of it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Arbuthnot, one bough only; I threw it down on the rock as it got\r\nin the way when I was carrying the basket.”\r\n\r\n“Which flowering bough we all thought we saw the Sleeper Oro carry away\r\nafter Tommy had brought it to him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; he made me pick it up and give it to him,” said Bastin.\r\n\r\n“Well, if we did not see this it should still be lying on the rock, as\r\nthere has been no wind and there are no animals here to carry it away.\r\nYou will admit that, Bickley?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n“Then if it has gone you will admit also that the presumption is that\r\nwe saw what we thought we did see?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know how that conclusion can be avoided, at any rate so far\r\nas the incident of the bough is concerned,” replied Bickley with\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\nThen, without more words, we started to look. At the spot where the\r\nbough should have been, there was no bough, but on the rock lay several\r\nof the red flowers, bitten off, I suppose, by Tommy while he was\r\ncarrying it. Nor was this all. I think I have mentioned that the\r\nGlittering Lady wore sandals which were fastened with red studs that\r\nlooked like rubies or carbuncles. On the rock lay one of these studs. I\r\npicked it up and we examined it. It had been sewn to the sandal-strap\r\nwith golden thread or silk. Some of this substance hung from the hole\r\ndrilled in the stone which served for an eye. It was as rotten as\r\ntinder, apparently with extreme age. Moreover, the hard gem itself was\r\npitted as though the passage of time had taken effect upon it, though\r\nthis may have been caused by other agencies, such as the action of the\r\nradium rays. I smiled at Bickley who looked disconcerted and even sad.\r\nIn a way it is painful to see the effect upon an able and earnest man\r\nof the upsetting of his lifelong theories.\r\n\r\nWe went for our walk, keeping to the flat lands at the foot of the\r\nvolcano cone, for we seemed to have had enough of wonders and to desire\r\nto reassure ourselves, as it were, by the study of natural and familiar\r\nthings. As it chanced, too, we were rewarded by sundry useful\r\ndiscoveries. Thus we found a place where the bread-tree and other\r\nfruits, most of them now ripe, grew in abundance, as did the yam. Also,\r\nwe came to an inlet that we noticed was crowded with large and\r\nbeautiful fish from the lake, which seemed to find it a favourite spot.\r\nPerhaps this was because a little stream of excellent water ran in\r\nhere, overflowing from the great pool or mere which filled the crater\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nAt these finds we rejoiced greatly, for now we knew that we need not\r\nfear starvation even should our supply of food from the main island be\r\ncut off. Indeed, by help of some palm-leaf stalks which we wove\r\ntogether roughly, Bastin, who was rather clever at this kind of thing,\r\nmanaged to trap four fish weighing two or three pounds apiece, wading\r\ninto the water to do so. It was curious to observe with what ease he\r\nadapted himself to the manners and customs of primeval man, so much so,\r\nindeed, that Bickley remarked that if he could believe in\r\nre-incarnation, he would be absolutely certain that Bastin was a\r\ntroglodyte in his last sojourn on the earth.\r\n\r\nHowever this might be, Bastin’s primeval instincts and abilities were\r\nof the utmost service to us. Before we had been many days on that\r\nisland he had built us a kind of native hut or house roofed with palm\r\nleaves in which, until provided with a better, as happened afterwards,\r\nwe ate and he and Bickley slept, leaving the tent to me. Moreover, he\r\nwove a net of palm fibre with which he caught abundance of fish, and\r\nmade fishing-lines of the same material (fortunately we had some hooks)\r\nwhich he baited with freshwater mussels and the insides of fish. By\r\nmeans of these he secured some veritable monsters of the carp species\r\nthat proved most excellent eating. His greatest triumph, however, was a\r\ndecoy which he constructed of boughs, wherein he trapped a number of\r\nwaterfowl. So that soon we kept a very good table of a sort, especially\r\nafter he had learned how to cook our food upon the native plan by means\r\nof hot stones. This suited us admirably, as it enabled Bickley and\r\nmyself to devote all our time to archaeological and other studies which\r\ndid not greatly interest Bastin.\r\n\r\nBy the time that we got back to camp it was drawing towards evening, so\r\nwe cooked our food and ate, and then, thoroughly exhausted, made\r\nourselves as comfortable as we could and went to sleep. Even our\r\nmarvelous experiences could not keep Bickley and myself from sleeping,\r\nand on Bastin such things had no effect. He accepted them and that was\r\nall, much more readily than we did, indeed. Triple-armed as he was in\r\nthe mail of a child-like faith, he snapped his fingers at evil spirits\r\nwhich he supposed the Sleepers to be, and at everything else that other\r\nmen might dread.\r\n\r\nNow, as I have mentioned, after our talk with Marama, although we did\r\nnot think it wise to adventure ourselves among them again at present,\r\nwe had lost all fear of the Orofenans. In this attitude, so far as\r\nMarama himself and the majority of his people were concerned, we were\r\nquite justified, for they were our warm friends. But in the case of the\r\nsorcerers, the priests and all their rascally and superstitious\r\nbrotherhood, we were by no means justified. They had not forgiven\r\nBastin his sacrilege or for his undermining of their authority by the\r\npreaching of new doctrines which, if adopted, would destroy them as a\r\nhierarchy. Nor had they forgiven Bickley for shooting one of their\r\nnumber, or any of us for our escape from the vengeance of their god.\r\n\r\nSo it came about that they made a plot to seize us all and hale us off\r\nto be sacrificed to a substituted image of Oro, which by now they had\r\nset up. They knew exactly where we slept upon the rock; indeed, our\r\nfire showed it to them and so far they were not afraid to venture,\r\nsince here they had been accustomed for generations to lay their\r\nofferings to the god of the Mountain. Secretly on the previous night,\r\nwithout the knowledge of Marama, they had carried two more canoes to\r\nthe borders of the lake. Now on this night, just as the moon was\r\nsetting about three in the morning, they made their attack, twenty-one\r\nmen in all, for the three canoes were large, relying on the following\r\ndarkness to get us away and convey us to the place of sacrifice to be\r\noffered up at dawn and before Marama could interfere.\r\n\r\nThe first we knew of the matter, for most foolishly we had neglected to\r\nkeep a watch, was the unpleasant sensation of brawny savages kneeling\r\non us and trussing us up with palm-fibre ropes. Also they thrust\r\nhandfuls of dry grass into our mouths to prevent us from calling out,\r\nalthough as air came through the interstices of the grass, we did not\r\nsuffocate. The thing was so well done that we never struck a blow in\r\nself-defence, and although we had our pistols at hand, much less could\r\nwe fire a shot. Of course, we struggled as well as we were able, but it\r\nwas quite useless; in three minutes we were as helpless as calves in a\r\nnet and like calves were being conveyed to the butcher. Bastin managed\r\nto get the gag out of his mouth for a few seconds, and I heard him say\r\nin his slow, heavy voice:\r\n\r\n“This, Bickley, is what comes of trafficking with evil spirits in\r\nmuseum cases—” There his speech stopped, for the grass wad was jammed\r\ndown his throat again, but distinctly I heard the inarticulate Bickley\r\nsnort as he conceived the repartee he was unable to utter. As for\r\nmyself, I reflected that the business served us right for not keeping a\r\nwatch, and abandoned the issue to fate.\r\n\r\nStill, to confess the truth, I was infinitely more sorry to die than I\r\nshould have been forty-eight hours earlier. This is a dull and in most\r\nways a dreadful world, one, if we could only summon the courage, that\r\nsome of us would be glad to leave in search of new adventures. But here\r\na great and unprecedented adventure had begun to befall me, and before\r\nits mystery was solved, before even I could formulate a theory\r\nconcerning it, my body must be destroyed, and my intelligence that was\r\ncaged therein, sent far afield; or, if Bickley were right, eclipsed. It\r\nseemed so sad just when the impossible, like an unguessed wandering\r\nmoon, had risen over the grey flats of the ascertained and made them\r\nshine with hope and wonder.\r\n\r\nThey carried us off to the canoes, not too gently; indeed, I heard the\r\nbony frame of Bastin bump into the bottom of one of them and reflected,\r\nnot without venom, that it served him right as he was the fount and\r\norigin of our woes. Two stinking magicians, wearing on their heads\r\nundress editions of their court cages, since these were too cumbersome\r\nfor active work of the sort, and painted all over with various\r\npigments, were just about to swing me after him into the same, or\r\nanother canoe, when something happened. I did not know what it was, but\r\nas a result, my captors left hold of me so that I fell to the rock,\r\nlying upon my back.\r\n\r\nThen, within my line of vision, which, it must be remembered, was\r\nlimited because I could not lift my head, appeared the upper part of\r\nthe tall person of the Ancient who said that he was named Oro. I could\r\nonly see him down to his middle, but I noted vaguely that he seemed to\r\nbe much changed. For instance, he wore a different coloured dress, or\r\nrather robe; this time it was dark blue, which caused me to wonder\r\nwhere on earth it came from. Also, his tremendous beard had been\r\ntrimmed and dressed, and on his head there was a simple black cap,\r\nstrangely quilted, which looked as though it were made of velvet.\r\nMoreover, his face had plumped out. He still looked ancient, it is\r\ntrue, and unutterably wise, but now he resembled an antique youth, so\r\ngreat were his energy and vigour. Also, his dark and glowing eyes shone\r\nwith a fearful intensity. In short, he seemed impressive and terrible\r\nalmost beyond imagining.\r\n\r\nHe looked about him slowly, then asked in a deep, cold voice, speaking\r\nin the Orofenan tongue:\r\n\r\n“What do you, slaves?”\r\n\r\nNo one seemed able to answer, they were too horror-stricken at this\r\nsudden vision of their fabled god, whose fierce features of wood had\r\nbecome flesh; they only turned to fly. He waved his thin hand and they\r\ncame to a standstill, like animals which have reached the end of their\r\ntether and are checked by the chains that bind them. There they stood\r\nin all sorts of postures, immovable and looking extremely ridiculous in\r\ntheir paint and feathers, with dread unutterable stamped upon their\r\nevil faces.\r\n\r\nThe Sleeper spoke again:\r\n\r\n“You would murder as did your forefathers, O children of snakes and\r\nhogs fashioned in the shape of men. You would sacrifice those who dwell\r\nin my shadow to satisfy your hate because they are wiser than you. Come\r\nhither thou,” and he beckoned with a bony finger to the chief magician.\r\n\r\nThe man advanced towards him in short jumps, as a mechanical toy might\r\ndo, and stood before him, his miniature crate and feathers all awry and\r\nthe sweat of terror melting the paint in streaks upon his face.\r\n\r\n“Look into the eyes of Oro, O worshipper of Oro,” said the Sleeper, and\r\nhe obeyed, his own eyes starting out of his head.\r\n\r\n“Receive the curse of Oro,” said the Ancient again. Then followed a\r\nterrible spectacle. The man went raving mad. He bounded into the air to\r\na height inconceivable. He threw himself upon the ground and rolled\r\nupon the rock. He rose again and staggered round and round, tearing\r\npieces out of his arms with his teeth. He yelled hideously like one\r\npossessed. He grovelled, beating his forehead against the rock. Then he\r\nsat up, slowly choked and—died.\r\n\r\nHis companions seemed to catch the infection of death as terrified\r\nsavages often do. They too performed dreadful antics, all except three\r\nof them who stood paralysed. They rushed about battering each other\r\nwith their fists and wooden weapons, looking like devils from hell in\r\ntheir hideous painted attire. They grappled and fought furiously. They\r\nseparated and plunged into the lake, where with a last grimace they\r\nsank like stones.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to last a long while, but I think that as a matter of fact\r\nwithin five minutes it was over; they were all dead. Only the three\r\nparalysed ones remained standing and rolling their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Sleeper beckoned to them with his thin finger, and they walked\r\nforward in step like soldiers.\r\n\r\n“Lift that man from the boat,” he said, pointing to Bastin, “cut his\r\nbonds and those of the others.”\r\n\r\nThey obeyed with a wonderful alacrity. In a minute we stood at liberty\r\nand were pulling the grass gags from our mouths. The Ancient pointed to\r\nthe head magician who lay dead upon the rock, his hideous, contorted\r\ncountenance staring open-eyed at heaven.\r\n\r\n“Take that sorcerer and show him to the other sorcerers yonder,” he\r\nsaid, “and tell them where your fellows are if they would find them.\r\nKnow by these signs that the Oro, god of the Mountain, who has slept a\r\nwhile, is awake, and ill will it go with them who question his power or\r\ndare to try to harm those who dwell in his house. Bring food day by day\r\nand await commands. Begone!”\r\n\r\nThe dreadful-looking body was bundled into one of the canoes, that out\r\nof which Bastin had emerged. A rower sprang into each of them and\r\npresently was paddling as he had never done before. As the setting moon\r\nvanished, they vanished with it, and once more there was a great\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“I am going to find my boots,” said Bastin. “This rock is hard and I\r\nhurt my feet kicking at those poor fellows who appear to have come to a\r\nbad end, how, I do not exactly understand. Personally, I think that\r\nmore allowances should have been made for them, as I hope will be the\r\ncase elsewhere, since after all they only acted according to their\r\nlights.”\r\n\r\n“Curse their lights!” ejaculated Bickley, feeling his throat which was\r\nbruised. “I’m glad they are out.”\r\n\r\nBastin limped away in search of his boots, but Bickley and I stood\r\nwhere we were contemplating the awakened Sleeper. All recollection of\r\nthe recent tumultuous scene seemed to have passed from his mind, for he\r\nwas engaged in a study of the heavens. They were wonderfully brilliant\r\nnow that the moon was down, brilliant as they only can be in the\r\ntropics when the sky is clear.\r\n\r\nSomething caused me to look round, and there, coming towards us, was\r\nshe who said her name was Yva. Evidently all her weakness had departed\r\nalso, for now she needed no support, but walked with a peculiar gliding\r\nmotion that reminded me of a swan floating forward on the water. Well\r\nhad we named her the Glittering Lady, for in the starlight literally\r\nshe seemed to glitter. I suppose the effect came from her golden\r\nraiment, which, however, I noticed, as in her father’s case, was not\r\nthe same that she had worn in the coffin; also from her hair that\r\nseemed to give out a light of its own. At least, she shimmered as she\r\ncame, her tall shape swaying at every step like a willow in the wind.\r\nShe drew near, and I saw that her face, too, had filled out and now was\r\nthat of one in perfect health and vigour, while her eyes shone softly\r\nand seemed wondrous large.\r\n\r\nIn her hands she carried those two plates of metal which I had seen\r\nlying in the coffin of the Sleeper Oro. These she gave to him, then\r\nfell back out of his hearing—if it were ever possible to do this, a\r\npoint on which I am not sure—and began to talk to me. I noted at once\r\nthat in the few hours during which she was absent, her knowledge of the\r\nOrofenan tongue seemed to have improved greatly as though she had drunk\r\ndeeply from some hidden fount of memory. Now she spoke it with\r\nreadiness, as Oro had done when he addressed the sorcerers, although\r\nmany of the words she used were not known to me, and the general form\r\nof her language appeared archaic, as for instance that of Spenser as\r\ncompared with modern English. When she saw I did not comprehend her,\r\nhowever, she would stop and cast her sentences in a different shape,\r\ntill at length I caught her meaning. Now I give the substance of what\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n“You are safe,” she began, glancing first at the palm ropes that lay\r\nupon the rock and then at my wrists, one of which was cut.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Lady Yva, thanks to your father.”\r\n\r\n“You should say thanks to me. My father was thinking of other things,\r\nbut I was thinking of you strangers, and from where I was I saw those\r\nwicked ones coming to kill you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! from the top of the mountain, I suppose.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head and smiled but vouchsafed no further explanation,\r\nunless her following words can be so called. These were:\r\n\r\n“I can see otherwise than with my eyes, if I choose.” A statement that\r\ncaused Bickley, who was listening, to mutter:\r\n\r\n“Impossible! What the deuce can she mean? Telepathy, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“I saw,” she continued, “and told the Lord, my father. He came forth.\r\nDid he kill them? I did not look to learn.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. They lie in the lake, all except three whom he sent away as\r\nmessengers.”\r\n\r\n“I thought so. Death is terrible, O Humphrey, but it is a sword which\r\nthose who rule must use to smite the wicked and the savage.”\r\n\r\nNot wishing to pursue this subject, I asked her what her father was\r\ndoing with the metal plates.\r\n\r\n“He reads the stars,” she answered, “to learn how long we have been\r\nasleep. Before we went to sleep he made two pictures of them, as they\r\nwere then and as they should be at the time he had set for our\r\nawakening.”\r\n\r\n“We set that time,” interrupted Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Not so, O Bickley,” she answered, smiling again. “In the divine Oro’s\r\nhead was the time set. You were the hand that executed his decree.”\r\n\r\nWhen Bickley heard this I really thought he would have burst. However,\r\nhe controlled himself nobly, being anxious to hear the end of this\r\nmysterious fib.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n“How long was the time that the lord Oro set apart for sleep?” I asked.\r\n\r\nShe paused as though puzzled to find words to express her meaning, then\r\nheld up her hands and said:\r\n\r\n“Ten,” nodding at her fingers. By second thoughts she took Bickley’s\r\nhands, not mine, and counted his ten fingers.\r\n\r\n“Ten years,” said Bickley. “Well, of course, it is impossible, but\r\nperhaps—” and he paused.\r\n\r\n“Ten tens,” she went on with a deepening smile, “one hundred.”\r\n\r\n“O!” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Ten hundreds, one thousand.”\r\n\r\n“I say!” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Ten times ten thousand, one hundred thousand.”\r\n\r\nBickley became silent.\r\n\r\n“Twice one hundred thousand and half a hundred thousand, two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand years. _That_ was the space of time which the lord\r\nOro, my father, set for our sleep. Whether it has been fulfilled he\r\nwill know presently when he has read the book of the stars and made\r\ncomparison of it with what he wrote before we laid us down to rest,”\r\nand she pointed to the metal plates which the Ancient was studying.\r\n\r\nBickley walked away, making sounds as though he were going to be ill\r\nand looking so absurd in his indignation that I nearly laughed. The\r\nLady Yva actually did laugh, and very musical was that laugh.\r\n\r\n“He does not believe,” she said. “He is so clever he knows everything.\r\nBut two hundred and fifty thousand years ago we should have thought him\r\nquite stupid. Then we could read the stars and calculate their\r\nmovements for ever.”\r\n\r\n“So can we,” I answered, rather nettled.\r\n\r\n“I am glad, O Humphrey, since you will be able to show my father if in\r\none of them he is wrong.”\r\n\r\nSecretly I hoped that this task would not be laid on me. Indeed, I\r\nthought it well to change the subject for the edification of Bickley\r\nwho had recovered and was drawn back by his eager curiosity. Just then,\r\ntoo, Bastin joined us, happy in his regained boots.\r\n\r\n“You tell us, Lady Yva,” I said, “that you slept, or should have slept\r\nfor two hundred and fifty thousand years.” Here Bastin opened his eyes.\r\n“If that was so, where was your mind all this time?”\r\n\r\n“If by my mind you mean spirit, O Humphrey, I have to answer that at\r\npresent I do not know for certain. I think, however, that it dwelt\r\nelsewhere, perhaps in other bodies on the earth, or some different\r\nearth. At least, I know that my heart is very full of memories which as\r\nyet I cannot unroll and read.”\r\n\r\n“Great heavens, this is madness!” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“In the great heavens,” she answered slowly, “there are many things\r\nwhich you, poor man, would think to be madness, but yet are truth and\r\nperfect wisdom. These things, or some of them, soon I shall hope to\r\nshow you.”\r\n\r\n“Do if you can,” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” interrupted Bastin. “I think the lady’s remarks quite\r\nreasonable. It seems to me highly improbable if really she has slept\r\nfor two hundred and fifty thousand years, which, of course, I can’t\r\ndecide, that an immortal spirit would be allowed to remain idle for so\r\nlong. That would be wallowing in a bed of idleness and shirking its\r\nduty which is to do its work. Also, as she tells you, Bickley, you are\r\nnot half so clever as you think you are in your silly scepticism, and I\r\nhave no doubt that there are many things in other worlds which would\r\nexpose your ignorance, if only you could see them.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Oro turned and called his daughter. She went at once,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n“Come, strangers, and you shall learn.”\r\n\r\nSo we followed her.\r\n\r\n“Daughter,” he said, speaking in Orofenan, I think that we might\r\nunderstand, “ask these strangers to bring one of those lamps of theirs\r\nthat by the light of it I may study these writings.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps this may serve,” said Bickley, suddenly producing an electric\r\ntorch from his pocket and flashing it into his face. It was his form of\r\nrepartee for all he had suffered at the hands of this incomprehensible\r\npair. Let me say at once that it was singularly successful. Perhaps the\r\nwisdom of the ages in which Oro flourished had overlooked so small a\r\nmatter as electric torches, or perhaps he did not expect to meet with\r\nthem in these degenerate days. At any rate for the first and last time\r\nin my intercourse with him I saw the god, or lord—the native word bears\r\neither meaning—Oro genuinely astonished. He started and stepped back,\r\nand for a moment or two seemed a little frightened. Then muttering\r\nsomething as to the cleverness of this light-producing instrument, he\r\nmotioned to his daughter to take it from Bickley and hold it in a\r\ncertain position. She obeyed, and in its illumination he began to study\r\nthe engraved plates, holding one of them in either hand.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he gave me one of the plates to hold, and with his\r\ndisengaged hand pointed successively to the constellation of Orion, to\r\nthe stars Castor, Pollux, Aldebaran, Rigel, the Pleiades, Sirius and\r\nothers which with my very limited knowledge I could not recognise\r\noffhand. Then on the plate which I held, he showed us those same stars\r\nand constellations, checking them one by one.\r\n\r\nThen he remarked very quietly that all was in order, and handing the\r\nplate he held to Yva, said:\r\n\r\n“The calculations made so long ago are correct, nor have the stars\r\nvaried in their proper motions during what is after all but an hour of\r\ntime. If you, Stranger, who, I understand, are named Humphrey, should\r\nbe, as I gather, a heaven-master, naturally you will ask me how I could\r\nfix an exact date by the stars without an error of, let us say, from\r\nfive to ten thousand years. I answer you that by the proper motion of\r\nthe stars alone it would have been difficult. Therefore I remember that\r\nin order to be exact, I calculated the future conjunctions of those two\r\nplanets,” and he pointed to Saturn and Jupiter. “Finding that one of\r\nthese occurred near yonder star,” and he indicated the bright orb,\r\nSpica, “at a certain time, I determined that then I would awake.\r\nBehold! There are the stars as I engraved them from my foreknowledge,\r\nupon this chart, and there those two great planets hang in conjunction.\r\nDaughter Yva, my wisdom has not failed me. This world of ours has\r\ntravelled round the sun neither less nor more than two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand times since we laid ourselves down to sleep. It is\r\nwritten here, and yonder,” and he pointed, first to the engraved plates\r\nand then to the vast expanse of the starlit heavens.\r\n\r\nAwe fell on me; I think that even Bickley and Bastin were awed, at any\r\nrate for the moment. It was a terrible thing to look on a being, to all\r\nappearance more or less human, who alleged that he had been asleep for\r\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand years, and proceeded to prove it by\r\ncertain ancient star charts. Of course at the time I could not check\r\nthose charts, lacking the necessary knowledge, but I have done so since\r\nand found that they are quite accurate. However this made no\r\ndifference, since the circumstances and something in his manner\r\nconvinced me that he spoke the absolute truth.\r\n\r\nHe and his daughter had been asleep for two hundred and fifty thousand\r\nyears. Oh! Heavens, _for two hundred and fifty thousand years!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nOro Speaks and Bastin Argues\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader of what I have written, should there ever be such a person,\r\nmay find the record marvelous, and therefore rashly conclude that\r\nbecause it is beyond experience, it could not be. It is not a wise\r\ndeduction, as I think Bickley would admit today, because without doubt\r\nmany things are which surpass our extremely limited experience.\r\nHowever, those who draw the veil from the Unknown and reveal the New,\r\nmust expect incredulity, and accept it without grumbling. Was that not\r\nthe fate, for instance, of those who in the Middle Ages, a few hundred\r\nyears ago, discovered, or rather rediscovered the mighty movements of\r\nthose constellations which served Oro for an almanac?\r\n\r\nBut the point I want to make is that if the sceptic plays a Bickleyan\r\npart as regards what has been written, it seems probable that his\r\nattitude will be accentuated as regards that which it still remains for\r\nme to write. If so, I cannot help it, and must decline entirely to\r\nwater down or doctor facts and thus pander to his prejudice and\r\nignorance. For my part I cannot attempt to explain these occurrences; I\r\nonly know that they happened and that I set down what I saw, heard and\r\nfelt, neither more nor less.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Oro had triumphantly vindicated his stellar\r\ncalculations he turned and departed into the cave, followed by his\r\ndaughter, waving to us to remain where we were. As she passed us,\r\nhowever, the Glittering Lady whispered—this time to Bastin—that he\r\nwould see them again in a few hours, adding:\r\n\r\n“We have much to learn and I hope that then you who, I understand, are\r\na priest, will begin to teach us of your religion and other matters.”\r\n\r\nBastin was so astonished that he could make no reply, but when they had\r\ngone he said:\r\n\r\n“Which of you told her that I was a priest?”\r\n\r\nWe shook our heads for neither of us could remember having done so.\r\n\r\n“Well, I did not,” continued Bastin, “since at present I have found no\r\nopportunity of saying a word in season. So I suppose she must have\r\ngathered it from my attire, though as a matter of fact I haven’t been\r\nwearing a collar, and those men who wanted to cook me, pulled off my\r\nwhite tie and I didn’t think it worth while dirtying a clean one.”\r\n\r\n“If,” said Bickley, “you imagine that you look like the minister of any\r\nreligion ancient or modern in a grubby flannel shirt, a battered\r\nsun-helmet, a torn green and white umbrella and a pair of ragged duck\r\ntrousers, you are mistaken, Bastin, that is all.”\r\n\r\n“I admit that the costume is not appropriate, Bickley, but how\r\notherwise could she have learned the truth?”\r\n\r\n“These people seem to have ways of learning a good many things. But in\r\nyour case, Bastin, the cause is clear enough. You have been walking\r\nabout with the head of that idol and always keep it close to you. No\r\ndoubt they believe that you are a priest of the worship of the god of\r\nthe Grove—Baal, you know, or something of that sort.”\r\n\r\nWhen he heard this Bastin’s face became a perfect picture. Never before\r\ndid I see it so full of horror struggling with indignation.\r\n\r\n“I must undeceive them without a moment’s delay,” he said, and was\r\nstarting for the cave when we caught his arms and held him.\r\n\r\n“Better wait till they come back, old fellow,” I said, laughing. “If\r\nyou disobey that Lord Oro you may meet with another experience in the\r\nsacrifice line.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right, Arbuthnot. I will occupy the interval in\r\npreparing a suitable address.”\r\n\r\n“Much better occupy it in preparing breakfast,” said Bickley. “I have\r\nalways noticed that you are at your best extempore.”\r\n\r\nIn the end he did prepare breakfast though in a _distrait_ fashion;\r\nindeed I found him beginning to make tea in the frying-pan. Bastin felt\r\nthat his opportunity had arrived, and was making ready to rise to the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nAlso we felt, all three of us, that we were extremely shabby-looking\r\nobjects, and though none of us said so, each did his best to improve\r\nhis personal appearance. First of all Bickley cut Bastin’s and my hair,\r\nafter which I did him the same service. Then Bickley who was normally\r\nclean shaven, set to work to remove a beard of about a week’s growth,\r\nand I who wore one of the pointed variety, trimmed up mine as best I\r\ncould with the help of a hand-glass. Bastin, too, performed on his\r\nwhich was of the square and rather ragged type, wisely rejecting\r\nBickley’s advice to shave it off altogether, offered, I felt convinced,\r\nbecause he felt that the result on Bastin would be too hideous for\r\nwords. After this we cut our nails, cleaned our teeth and bathed; I\r\neven caught Bickley applying hair tonic from his dressing case in\r\nsecret, behind a projecting rock, and borrowed some myself. He gave it\r\nme on condition that I did not mention its existence to Bastin who, he\r\nremarked, would certainly use the lot and make himself smell horrible.\r\n\r\nNext we found clean ducks among our store of spare clothes, for the\r\nOrofenans had brought these with our other possessions, and put them\r\non, even adding silk cumberbunds and neckties. My tie I fastened with a\r\npin that I had obtained in Egypt. It was a tiny gold statuette of very\r\nfine and early workmanship, of the god Osiris, wearing the crown of the\r\nUpper Land with the uraeus crest, and holding in his hands, which\r\nprojected from the mummy wrappings, the emblems of the crook, the\r\nscourge and the _crux ansata_, or Sign of Life.\r\n\r\nBastin, for his part, arrayed himself in full clerical costume, black\r\ncoat and trousers, white tie and stick-up clergyman’s collar which, as\r\nhe remarked, made him feel extremely hot in that climate, and were\r\nunsuitable to domestic duties, such as washing-up. I offered to hold\r\nhis coat while he did this office and told him he looked very nice\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\n“Beautiful!” remarked Bickley, “but why don’t you put on your surplice\r\nand biretta?” (Being very High-Church Bastin did wear a biretta on\r\nfestival Sundays at home.) “There would be no mistake about you then.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think it would be suitable,” replied Bastin whose sense of\r\nhumour was undeveloped. “There is no service to be performed at present\r\nand no church, though perhaps that cave—” and he stopped.\r\n\r\nWhen we had finished these vain adornments and Bastin had put away the\r\nthings and tidied up, we sat down, rather at a loose end. We should\r\nhave liked to walk but refrained from doing so for fear lest we might\r\ndirty our clean clothes. So we just sat and thought. At least Bickley\r\nthought, and so did I for a while until I gave it up. What was the use\r\nof thinking, seeing that we were face to face with circumstances which\r\nbaffled reason and beggared all recorded human experience? What Bastin\r\ndid I am sure I do not know, but I think from the expression of his\r\ncountenance that he was engaged in composing sermons for the benefit of\r\nOro and the Glittering Lady.\r\n\r\nOne diversion we did have. About eleven o’clock a canoe came from the\r\nmain island laden with provisions and paddled by Marama and two of his\r\npeople. We seized our weapons, remembering our experiences of the\r\nnight, but Marama waved a bough in token of peace. So, carrying our\r\nrevolvers, we went to the rock edge to meet him. He crept ashore and,\r\nchief though he was, prostrated himself upon his face before us, which\r\ntold me that he had heard of the fate of the sorcerers. His apologies\r\nwere abject. He explained that he had no part in the outrage of the\r\nattack, and besought us to intercede on behalf of him and his people\r\nwith the awakened god of the Mountain whom he looked for with a\r\nterrified air.\r\n\r\nWe consoled him as well as we could, and told him that he had best be\r\ngone before the god of the Mountain appeared, and perhaps treated him\r\nas he had done the sorcerers. In his name, however, we commanded Marama\r\nto bring materials and build us a proper house upon the rock, also to\r\nbe sure to keep up a regular and ample supply of provisions. If he did\r\nthese things, and anything else we might from time to time command, we\r\nsaid that perhaps his life and those of his people would be spared.\r\nThis, however, after the evil behaviour of some of them of course we\r\ncould not guarantee.\r\n\r\nMarama departed so thoroughly frightened that he even forgot to make\r\nany inquiries as to who this god of the Mountain might be, or where he\r\ncame from, or whither he was going. Of course, the place had been\r\nsacred among his people from the beginning, whenever that may have\r\nbeen, but that its sacredness should materialise into an active god who\r\nbrought sorcerers of the highest reputation to a most unpleasant end,\r\njust because they wished to translate their preaching into practice,\r\nwas another matter. It was not to be explained even by the fact of\r\nwhich he himself had informed me, that during the dreadful storm of\r\nsome months before, the cave mouth which previously was not visible on\r\nthe volcano, had suddenly been lifted up above the level of the Rock of\r\nOfferings, although, of course, all religious and instructed persons\r\nwould have expected something peculiar to happen after this event.\r\n\r\nSuch I knew were his thoughts, but, as I have said, he was too\r\nfrightened and too hurried to express them in questions that I should\r\nhave found it extremely difficult to answer. As it was he departed\r\nquite uncertain as to whether one of us was not the real “god of the\r\nMountain,” who had power to bring hideous death upon his molesters.\r\nAfter all, what had he to go on to the contrary, except the word of\r\nthree priests who were so terrified that they could give no coherent\r\naccount of what had happened? Of these events, it was true, there was\r\nevidence in the twisted carcass of their lamented high sorcerer, and,\r\nfor the matter of that, of certain corpses which he had seen, that lay\r\nin shallow water at the bottom of the lake. Beyond all was vague, and\r\nin his heart I am sure that Marama believed that Bastin was the real\r\n“god of the Mountain.” Naturally, he would desire to work vengeance on\r\nthose who tried to sacrifice and eat him. Moreover, had he not\r\ndestroyed the image of the god of the Grove and borne away its head\r\nwhence he had sucked magic and power?\r\n\r\nThus argued Marama, disbelieving the tale of the frightened sorcerers,\r\nfor he admitted as much to me in after days.\r\n\r\nMarama departed in a great hurry, fearing lest the “god of the\r\nMountain,” or Bastin, whose new and splendid garb he regarded with much\r\nsuspicion, might develop some evil energy against him. Then we went\r\nback to our camp, leaving the industrious Bastin, animated by a\r\nsuggestion from Bickley that the fruit and food might spoil if left in\r\nthe sun, to carry it into the shade of the cave. Owing to the terrors\r\nof the Orofenans the supply was so large that to do this he must make\r\nno fewer than seven journeys, which he did with great good will since\r\nBastin loved physical exercise. The result on his clerical garments,\r\nhowever, was disastrous. His white tie went awry, squashed fruit and\r\nroast pig gravy ran down his waistcoat and trousers, and his high\r\ncollar melted into limp crinkles in the moisture engendered by the\r\ntropical heat. Only his long coat escaped, since that Bickley kindly\r\ncarried for him.\r\n\r\nIt was just as he arrived with the seventh load in this extremely\r\ndishevelled condition that Oro and his daughter emerged from the cave.\r\nIndeed Bastin, who, being shortsighted, always wore spectacles that,\r\nowing to his heated state were covered with mist, not seeing that\r\ndignitary, dumped down the last basket on to his toes, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“There, you lazy beggar, I told you I would bring it all, and I have.”\r\n\r\nIn fact he thought he was addressing Bickley and playing off on him a\r\ntroglodytic practical joke.\r\n\r\nOro, however, who at his age did not appreciate jokes, resented it and\r\nwas about to do something unpleasant when with extraordinary tact his\r\ndaughter remarked:\r\n\r\n“Bastin the priest makes you offerings. Thank him, O Lord my father.”\r\n\r\nSo Oro thanked him, not too cordially for evidently he still had\r\nfeeling in his toes, and once more Bastin escaped. Becoming aware of\r\nhis error, he began to apologise profusely in English, while the lady\r\nYva studied him carefully.\r\n\r\n“Is that the costume of the priests of your religion, O Bastin?” she\r\nasked, surveying his dishevelled form. “If so, you were better without\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThen Bastin retired to straighten his tie, and grabbing his coat from\r\nBickley, who handed it to him with a malicious smile, forced his\r\nperspiring arms into it in a peculiarly awkward and elephantine\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bickley and I produced two camp chairs which we had made\r\nready, and on these the wondrous pair seated themselves side by side.\r\n\r\n“We have come to learn,” said Oro. “Teach!”\r\n\r\n“Not so, Father,” interrupted Yva, who, I noted, was clothed in yet a\r\nthird costume, though whence these came I could not imagine. “First I\r\nwould ask a question. Whence are you, Strangers, and how came you\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“We are from the country called England and a great storm shipwrecked\r\nus here; that, I think, which raised the mouth of the cave above the\r\nlevel of this rock,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“The time appointed having come when it should be raised,” said Oro as\r\nthough to himself.\r\n\r\n“Where is England?” asked Yva.\r\n\r\nNow among the books we had with us was a pocket atlas, quite a good one\r\nof its sort. By way of answer I opened it at the map of the world and\r\nshowed her England. Also I showed, to within a thousand miles or so,\r\nthat spot on the earth’s surface where we spoke together.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this atlas excited the pair greatly. They had not the\r\nslightest difficulty in understanding everything about it and the shape\r\nof the world with its division into hemispheres seemed to be quite\r\nfamiliar to them. What appeared chiefly to interest them, and\r\nespecially Oro, were the relative areas and positions of land and sea.\r\n\r\n“Of this, Strangers,” he said, pointing to the map, “I shall have much\r\nto say to you when I have studied the pictures of your book and\r\ncompared them with others of my own.”\r\n\r\n“So he has got maps,” said Bickley in English, “as well as star charts.\r\nI wonder where he keeps them.”\r\n\r\n“With his clothes, I expect,” suggested Bastin.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Oro had hidden the atlas in his ample robe and motioned to\r\nhis daughter to proceed.\r\n\r\n“Why do you come here from England so far away?” the Lady Yva asked, a\r\nquestion to which each of us had an answer.\r\n\r\n“To see new countries,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Because the cyclone brought us,” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“To convert the heathen to my own Christian religion,” said Bastin,\r\nwhich was not strictly true.\r\n\r\nIt was on this last reply that she fixed.\r\n\r\n“What does your religion teach?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“It teaches that those who accept it and obey its commands will live\r\nagain after death for ever in a better world where is neither sorrow\r\nnor sin,” he answered.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard this saying I saw Oro start as though struck by a new\r\nthought and look at Bastin with a curious intentness.\r\n\r\n“Who are the heathen?” Yva asked again after a pause, for she also\r\nseemed to be impressed.\r\n\r\n“All who do not agree with Bastin’s spiritual views,” answered Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Those who, whether from lack of instruction or from hardness of heart,\r\ndo not follow the true faith. For instance, I suppose that your father\r\nand you are heathen,” replied Bastin stoutly.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to astonish them, but presently Yva caught his meaning and\r\nsmiled, while Oro said:\r\n\r\n“Of this great matter of faith we will talk later. It is an old\r\nquestion in the world.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” went on Yva, “if you wished to travel so far did you come in a\r\nship that so easily is wrecked? Why did you not journey through the\r\nair, or better still, pass through space, leaving your bodies asleep,\r\nas, being instructed, doubtless you can do?”\r\n\r\n“As regards your first question,” I answered, “there are no aircraft\r\nknown that can make so long a journey.”\r\n\r\n“And as regards the second,” broke in Bickley, “we did not do so\r\nbecause it is impossible for men to transfer themselves to other places\r\nthrough space either with or without their bodies.”\r\n\r\nAt this information the Glittering Lady lifted her arched eyebrows and\r\nsmiled a little, while Oro said:\r\n\r\n“I perceive that the new world has advanced but a little way on the\r\nroad of knowledge.”\r\n\r\nFearing that Bastin was about to commence an argument, I began to ask\r\nquestions in my turn.\r\n\r\n“Lord Oro and Lady Yva,” I said, “we have told you something of\r\nourselves and will tell you more when you desire it. But pardon us if\r\nfirst we pray you to tell us what we burn to know. Who are you? Of what\r\nrace and country? And how came it that we found you sleeping yonder?”\r\n\r\n“If it be your pleasure, answer, my Father,” said Yva.\r\n\r\nOro thought a moment, then replied in a calm voice:\r\n\r\n“I am a king who once ruled most of the world as it was in my day,\r\nthough it is true that much of it rebelled against me, my councillors\r\nand servants. Therefore I destroyed the world as it was then, save only\r\ncertain portions whence life might spread to the new countries that I\r\nraised up. Having done this I put myself and my daughter to sleep for a\r\nspace of two hundred and fifty thousand years, that there might be time\r\nfor fresh civilisations to arise. Now I begin to think that I did not\r\nallot a sufficiency of ages, since I perceive from what you tell me,\r\nthat the learning of the new races is as yet but small.”\r\n\r\nBickley and I looked at each other and were silent. Mentally we had\r\ncollapsed. Who could begin to discuss statements built upon such a\r\nfoundation of gigantic and paralysing falsehoods?\r\n\r\nWell, Bastin could for one. With no more surprise in his voice than if\r\nhe were talking about last night’s dinner, he said:\r\n\r\n“There must be a mistake somewhere, or perhaps I misunderstand you. It\r\nis obvious that you, being a man, could not have destroyed the world.\r\nThat could only be done by the Power which made it and you.”\r\n\r\nI trembled for the results of Bastin’s methods of setting out the\r\ntruth. To my astonishment, however, Oro replied:\r\n\r\n“You speak wisely, Priest, but the Power you name may use instruments\r\nto accomplish its decrees. I am such an instrument.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” said Bastin, “just like anybody else. You have more\r\nknowledge of the truth than I thought. But pray, how did you destroy\r\nthe world?”\r\n\r\n“Using my wisdom to direct the forces that are at work in the heart of\r\nthis great globe, I drowned it with a deluge, causing one part to sink\r\nand another to rise, also changes of climate which completed the work.”\r\n\r\n“That’s quite right,” exclaimed Bastin delightedly. “We know all about\r\nthe Deluge, only _you_ are not mentioned in connection with the matter.\r\nA man, Noah, had to do with it when he was six hundred years old.”\r\n\r\n“Six hundred?” said Oro. “That is not very old. I myself had seen more\r\nthan a thousand years when I lay down to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand!” remarked Bastin, mildly interested. “That is unusual,\r\nthough some of these mighty men of renown we know lived over nine\r\nhundred.”\r\n\r\nHere Bickley snorted and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Nine hundred moons, he means.”\r\n\r\n“I did not know Noah,” went on Oro. “Perhaps he lived after my time and\r\ncaused some other local deluge. Is there anything else you wish to ask\r\nme before I leave you that I may study this map writing?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bastin. “Why were you allowed to drown your world?”\r\n\r\n“Because it was evil, Priest, and disobeyed me and the Power I serve.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! thank you,” said Bastin, “that fits in exactly. It was just the\r\nsame in Noah’s time.”\r\n\r\n“I pray that it is not just the same now,” said Oro, rising. “To-morrow\r\nwe will return, or if I do not who have much that I must do, the lady\r\nmy daughter will return and speak with you further.”\r\n\r\nHe departed into the cave, Yva following at a little distance.\r\n\r\nI accompanied her as far as the mouth of the cave, as did Tommy, who\r\nall this time had been sitting contentedly upon the hem of her gorgeous\r\nrobe, quite careless of its immemorial age, if it was immemorial and\r\nnot woven yesterday, a point on which I had no information.\r\n\r\n“Lady Yva,” I said, “did I rightly understand the Lord Oro to say that\r\nhe was a thousand years old?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, O Humphrey, and really he is more, or so I think.”\r\n\r\n“Then are you a thousand years old also?” I asked, aghast.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” she replied, shaking her head, “I am young, quite young, for\r\nI do not count my time of sleep.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly you look it,” I said. “But what, Lady Yva, do you mean by\r\nyoung?”\r\n\r\nShe answered my question by another.\r\n\r\n“What age are your women when they are as I am?”\r\n\r\n“None of our women were ever quite like you, Lady Yva. Yet, say from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty years of age.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I have been counting and now I remember. When my father sent me to\r\nsleep I was twenty-seven years old. No, I will not deceive you, I was\r\ntwenty-seven years and three moons.” Then, saying something to the\r\neffect that she would return, she departed, laughing a little in a\r\nmischievous way, and, although I did not observe this till afterwards,\r\nTommy departed with her.\r\n\r\nWhen I repeated what she had said to Bastin and Bickley, who were\r\nstanding at a distance straining their ears and somewhat aggrieved, the\r\nformer remarked:\r\n\r\n“If she is twenty-seven her father must have married late in life,\r\nthough of course it may have been a long while before he had children.”\r\n\r\nThen Bickley, who had been suppressing himself all this while, went off\r\nlike a bomb.\r\n\r\n“Do you tell us, Bastin,” he asked, “that you believe one word of all\r\nthis ghastly rubbish? I mean as to that antique charlatan being a\r\nthousand years old and having caused the Flood and the rest?”\r\n\r\n“If you ask me, Bickley, I see no particular reason to doubt it at\r\npresent. A person who can go to sleep in a glass coffin kept warm by a\r\npocketful of radium together with very accurate maps of the\r\nconstellations at the time he wakes up, can, I imagine, do most\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\n“Even cause the Deluge,” jeered Bickley.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about _the_ Deluge, but perhaps he may have been\r\npermitted to cause a deluge. Why not? You can’t look at things from far\r\nenough off, Bickley. And if something seems big to you, you conclude\r\nthat therefore it is impossible. The same Power which gives you skill\r\nto succeed in an operation, that hitherto was held impracticable, as I\r\nknow you have done once or twice, may have given that old fellow power\r\nto cause a deluge. You should measure the universe and its\r\npossibilities by worlds and not by acres, Bickley.”\r\n\r\n“And believe, I suppose, that a man can live a thousand years, whereas\r\nwe know well that he cannot live more than about a hundred.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t _know_ anything of the sort, Bickley. All you know is that\r\nover the brief period of history with which we are acquainted, say ten\r\nthousand years at most, men have only lived to about a hundred. But the\r\nvery rocks which you are so fond of talking about, tell us that even\r\nthis planet is millions upon millions of years of age. Who knows then\r\nbut that at some time in its history, men did not live for a thousand\r\nyears, and that lost civilisations did not exist of which this Oro and\r\nhis daughter may be two survivors?”\r\n\r\n“There is no proof of anything of the sort,” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know about proof, as you understand it, though I have read in\r\nPlato of a continent called Atlantis that was submerged, according to\r\nthe story of old Egyptian priests. But personally I have every proof,\r\nfor it is all written down in the Bible at which you turn up your nose,\r\nand I am very glad that I have been lucky enough to come across this\r\nunexpected confirmation of the story. Not that it matters much, since I\r\nshould have learned all about it when it pleases Providence to remove\r\nme to a better world, which in our circumstances may happen any day.\r\nNow I must change my clothes before I see to the cooking and other\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\n“I am bound to admit,” said Bickley, looking after him, “that old\r\nBastin is not so stupid as he seems. From his point of view the\r\narguments he advances are quite logical. Moreover I think he is right\r\nwhen he says that we look at things through the wrong end of the\r\ntelescope. After all the universe is very big and who knows what may\r\nhappen there? Who knows even what may have happened on this little\r\nearth during the æons of its existence, whenever its balance chanced to\r\nshift, as the Ice Ages show us it has often done? Still I believe that\r\nold Oro to be a Prince of Liars.”\r\n\r\n“That remains to be proved,” I answered cautiously. “All I know is that\r\nhe is a wonderfully learned person of most remarkable appearance, and\r\nthat his daughter is the loveliest creature I ever saw.”\r\n\r\n“There I agree,” said Bickley decidedly, “and as brilliant as she is\r\nlovely. If she belongs to a past civilisation, it is a pity that it\r\never became extinct. Now let’s go and have a nap. Bastin will call us\r\nwhen supper is ready.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nThe Under-world\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night we slept well and without fear, being quite certain that\r\nafter their previous experience the Orofenans would make no further\r\nattempts upon us. Indeed our only anxiety was for Tommy, whom we could\r\nnot find when the time came to give him his supper. Bastin, however,\r\nseemed to remember having seen him following the Glittering Lady into\r\nthe cave. This, of course, was possible, as certainly he had taken an\r\nenormous fancy to her and sat himself down as close to her as he could\r\non every occasion. He even seemed to like the ancient Oro, and was not\r\nafraid to jump up and plant his dirty paws upon that terrific person’s\r\ngorgeous robe. Moreover Oro liked him, for several times I observed him\r\npat the dog upon the head; as I think I have said, the only human touch\r\nthat I had perceived about him. So we gave up searching and calling in\r\nthe hope that he was safe with our supernatural friends.\r\n\r\nThe next morning quite early the Lady Yva appeared alone; no, not\r\nalone, for with her came our lost Tommy looking extremely spry and well\r\nat ease. The faithless little wretch just greeted us in a casual\r\nfashion and then went and sat by Yva. In fact when the awkward Bastin\r\nmanaged to stumble over the end of her dress Tommy growled at him and\r\nshowed his teeth. Moreover the dog was changed. He was blessed with a\r\nshiny black coat, but now this coat sparkled in the sunlight, like the\r\nLady Yva’s hair.\r\n\r\n“The Glittering Lady is all very well, but I’m not sure that I care for\r\na glittering dog. It doesn’t look quite natural,” said Bastin,\r\ncontemplating him.\r\n\r\n“Why does Tommy shine, Lady?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Because I washed him in certain waters that we have, so that now he\r\nlooks beautiful and smells sweet,” she answered, laughing.\r\n\r\nIt was true, the dog did smell sweet, which I may add had not always\r\nbeen the case with him, especially when there were dead fish about.\r\nAlso he appeared to have been fed, for he turned up his nose at the\r\nbits we had saved for his breakfast.\r\n\r\n“He has drunk of the Life-water,” explained Yva, “and will want no food\r\nfor two days.”\r\n\r\nBickley pricked up his ears at this statement and looked incredulous.\r\n\r\n“You do not believe, O Bickley,” she said, studying him gravely.\r\n“Indeed, you believe nothing. You think my father and I tell you many\r\nlies. Bastin there, he believes all. Humphrey? He is not sure; he\r\nthinks to himself, I will wait and find out whether or no these funny\r\npeople cheat me.”\r\n\r\nBickley coloured and made some remark about things which were contrary\r\nto experience, also that Tommy in a general way was rather a greedy\r\nlittle dog.\r\n\r\n“You, too, like to eat, Bickley” (this was true, he had an excellent\r\nappetite), “but when you have drunk the Life-water you will care much\r\nless.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear it,” interrupted Bastin, “for Bickley wants a lot of\r\ncooking done, and I find it tedious.”\r\n\r\n“You eat also, Lady,” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I eat sometimes because I like it, but I can go weeks and not\r\neat, when I have the Life-water. Just now, after so long a sleep, I am\r\nhungry. Please give me some of that fruit. No, not the flesh, flesh I\r\nhate.”\r\n\r\nWe handed it to her. She took two plantains, peeled and ate them with\r\nextraordinary grace. Indeed she reminded me, I do not know why, of some\r\nlovely butterfly drawing its food from a flower.\r\n\r\nWhile she ate she observed us closely; nothing seemed to escape the\r\nquick glances of those beautiful eyes. Presently she said:\r\n\r\n“What, O Humphrey, is that with which you fasten your neckdress?” and\r\nshe pointed to the little gold statue of Osiris that I used as a pin.\r\n\r\nI told her that it was a statuette of a god named Osiris and very, very\r\nancient, probably quite five thousand years old, a statement at which\r\nshe smiled a little; also that it came from Egypt.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she answered, “is it so? I asked because we have figures that are\r\nvery like to that one, and they also hold in their hands a staff\r\nsurmounted by a loop. They are figures of Sleep’s brother—Death.”\r\n\r\n“So is this,” I said. “Among the Egyptians Osiris was the god of\r\nDeath.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded and replied that doubtless the symbol had come down to them.\r\n\r\n“One day you shall take me to see this land which you call so very old.\r\nOr I will take you, which would be quicker,” she added.\r\n\r\nWe all bowed and said we should be delighted. Even Bastin appeared\r\nanxious to revisit Egypt in such company, though when he was there it\r\nseemed to bore him. But what she meant about taking us I could not\r\nguess. Nor had we time to ask her, for she went on, watching our faces\r\nas she spoke.\r\n\r\n“The Lord Oro sends you a message, Strangers. He asks whether it is\r\nyour wish to see where we dwell. He adds that you are not to come if\r\nyou do not desire, or if you fear danger.”\r\n\r\nWe all answered that there was nothing we should like better, but\r\nBastin added that he had already seen the tomb.\r\n\r\n“Do you think, Bastin, that we live in a tomb because we slept there\r\nfor a while, awaiting the advent of you wanderers at the appointed\r\nhour?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see where else it could be, unless it is further down that\r\ncave,” said Bastin. “The top of the mountain would not be convenient as\r\na residence.”\r\n\r\n“It has not been convenient for many an age, for reasons that I will\r\nshow you. Think now, before you come. You have naught to fear from us,\r\nand I believe that no harm will happen to you. But you will see many\r\nstrange things that will anger Bickley because he cannot understand\r\nthem, and perhaps will weary Bastin because his heart turns from what\r\nis wondrous and ancient. Only Humphrey will rejoice in them because the\r\ndoors of his soul are open and he longs—what do you long for,\r\nHumphrey?”\r\n\r\n“That which I have lost and fear I shall never find again,” I answered\r\nboldly.\r\n\r\n“I know that you have lost many things—last night, for instance, you\r\nlost Tommy, and when he slept with me he told me much about you\r\nand—others.”\r\n\r\n“This is ridiculous,” broke in Bastin. “Can a dog talk?”\r\n\r\n“Everything can talk, if you understand its language, Bastin. But keep\r\na good heart, Humphrey, for the bold seeker finds in the end. Oh!\r\nfoolish man, do you not understand that all is yours if you have but\r\nthe soul to conceive and the will to grasp? All, all, below, between,\r\nabove! Even I know that, I who have so much to learn.”\r\n\r\nSo she spoke and became suddenly magnificent. Her face which had been\r\nbut that of a super-lovely woman, took on grandeur. Her bosom swelled;\r\nher presence radiated some subtle power, much as her hair radiated\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIn a moment it was gone and she was smiling and jesting.\r\n\r\n“Will you come, Strangers, where Tommy was not afraid to go, down to\r\nthe Under-world? Or will you stay here in the sun? Perhaps you will do\r\nbetter to stay here in the sun, for the Under-world has terrors for\r\nweak hearts that were born but yesterday, and feeble feet may stumble\r\nin the dark.”\r\n\r\n“I shall take my electric torch,” said Bastin with decision, “and I\r\nadvise you fellows to do the same. I always hated cellars, and the\r\ncatacombs at Rome are worse, though full of sacred interest.”\r\n\r\nThen we started, Tommy frisking on ahead in a most provoking way as\r\nthough he were bored by a visit to a strange house and going home, and\r\nYva gliding forward with a smile upon her face that was half mystic and\r\nhalf mischievous. We passed the remains of the machines, and Bickley\r\nasked her what they were.\r\n\r\n“Carriages in which once we travelled through the skies, until we found\r\na better way, and that the uninstructed used till the end,” she\r\nanswered carelessly, leaving me wondering what on earth she meant.\r\n\r\nWe came to the statue and the sepulchre beneath without trouble, for\r\nthe glint of her hair, and I may add of Tommy’s back, were quite\r\nsufficient to guide us through the gloom. The crystal coffins were\r\nstill there, for Bastin flashed his torch and we saw them, but the\r\nboxes of radium had gone.\r\n\r\n“Let that light die,” she said to Bastin. “Humphrey, give me your right\r\nhand and give your left to Bickley. Let Bastin cling to him and fear\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\nWe passed to the end of the tomb and stood against what appeared to be\r\na rock wall, all close together, as she directed.\r\n\r\n“Fear nothing,” she said again, but next second I was never more full\r\nof fear in my life, for we were whirling downwards at a speed that\r\nwould have made an American elevator attendant turn pale.\r\n\r\n“Don’t choke me,” I heard Bickley say to Bastin, and the latter’s\r\nmurmured reply of:\r\n\r\n“I never could bear these moving staircases and tubelifts. They always\r\nmake me feel sick.”\r\n\r\nI admit that for my part I also felt rather sick and clung tightly to\r\nthe hand of the Glittering Lady. She, however, placed her other hand\r\nupon my shoulder, saying in a low voice:\r\n\r\n“Did I not tell you to have no fear?”\r\n\r\nThen I felt comforted, for somehow I knew that it was not her desire to\r\nharm and much less to destroy me. Also Tommy was seated quite at his\r\nease with his head resting against my leg, and his absence of alarm was\r\nreassuring. The only stoic of the party was Bickley. I have no doubt\r\nthat he was quite as frightened as we were, but rather than show it he\r\nwould have died.\r\n\r\n“I presume this machinery is pneumatic,” he began when suddenly and\r\nwithout shock, we arrived at the end of our journey. How far we had\r\nfallen I am sure I do not know, but I should judge from the awful speed\r\nat which we travelled, that it must have been several thousand feet,\r\nprobably four or five.\r\n\r\n“Everything seems steady now,” remarked Bastin, “so I suppose this\r\nluggage lift has stopped. The odd thing is that I can’t see anything of\r\nit. There ought to be a shaft, but we seem to be standing on a level\r\nfloor.”\r\n\r\n“The odd thing is,” said Bickley, “that we can see at all. Where the\r\ndevil does the light come from thousands of feet underground?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” answered Bastin, “unless there is natural gas here, as\r\nI am told there is at a town called Medicine Hat in Canada.”\r\n\r\n“Natural gas be blowed,” said Bickley. “It is more like moonlight\r\nmagnified ten times.”\r\n\r\nSo it was. The whole place was filled with a soft radiance, equal to\r\nthat of the sun at noon, but gentler and without heat.\r\n\r\n“Where does it come from?” I whispered to Yva.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she replied, as I thought evasively. “It is the light of the\r\nUnder-world which we know how to use. The earth is full of light, which\r\nis not wonderful, is it, seeing that its heart is fire? Now look about\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nI looked and leant on her harder than ever, since amazement made me\r\nweak. We were in some vast place whereof the roof seemed almost as far\r\noff as the sky at night. At least all that I could make out was a dim\r\nand distant arch which might have been one of cloud. For the rest, in\r\nevery direction stretched vastness, illuminated far as the eye could\r\nreach by the soft light of which I have spoken, that is, probably for\r\nseveral miles. But this vastness was not empty. On the contrary it was\r\noccupied by a great city. There were streets much wider than\r\nPiccadilly, all bordered by houses, though these, I observed, were\r\nroofless, very fine houses, some of them, built of white stone or\r\nmarble. There were roadways and pavements worn by the passage of feet.\r\nThere, farther on, were market-places or public squares, and there,\r\nlastly, was a huge central enclosure one or two hundred acres in\r\nextent, which was filled with majestic buildings that looked like\r\npalaces, or town-halls; and, in the midst of them all, a vast temple\r\nwith courts and a central dome. For here, notwithstanding the lack of\r\nnecessity, its builders seemed to have adhered to the Over-world\r\ntradition, and had roofed their fane.\r\n\r\nAnd now came the terror. All of this enormous city was _dead_. Had it\r\nstood upon the moon it could not have been more dead. None paced its\r\nstreets; none looked from its window-places. None trafficked in its\r\nmarkets, none worshipped in its temple. Swept, garnished, lighted,\r\npractically untouched by the hand of Time, here where no rains fell and\r\nno winds blew, it was yet a howling wilderness. For what wilderness is\r\nthere to equal that which once has been the busy haunt of men? Let\r\nthose who have stood among the buried cities of Central Asia, or of\r\nAnarajapura in Ceylon, or even amid the ruins of Salamis on the coast\r\nof Cyprus, answer the question. But here was something infinitely more\r\nawful. A huge human haunt in the bowels of the earth utterly devoid of\r\nhuman beings, and yet as perfect as on the day when these ceased to be.\r\n\r\n“I do not care for underground localities,” remarked Bastin, his gruff\r\nvoice echoing strangely in that terrible silence, “but it does seem a\r\npity that all these fine buildings should be wasted. I suppose their\r\ninhabitants left them in search of fresh air.”\r\n\r\n“Why did they leave them?” I asked of Yva.\r\n\r\n“Because death took them,” she answered solemnly. “Even those who live\r\na thousand years die at last, and if they have no children, with them\r\ndies the race.”\r\n\r\n“Then were you the last of your people?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Inquire of my father,” she replied, and led the way through the\r\nmassive arch of a great building.\r\n\r\nIt led into a walled courtyard in the centre of which was a plain\r\ncupola of marble with a gate of some pale metal that looked like\r\nplatinum mixed with gold. This gate stood open. Within it was the\r\nstatue of a woman beautifully executed in white marble and set in a\r\nniche of some black stone. The figure was draped as though to conceal\r\nthe shape, and the face was stern and majestic rather than beautiful.\r\nThe eyes of the statue were cunningly made of some enamel which gave\r\nthem a strange and lifelike appearance. They stared upwards as though\r\nlooking away from the earth and its concerns. The arms were\r\noutstretched. In the right hand was a cup of black marble, in the left\r\na similar cup of white marble. From each of these cups trickled a thin\r\nstream of sparkling water, which two streams met and mingled at a\r\ndistance of about three feet beneath the cups. Then they fell into a\r\nmetal basin which, although it must have been quite a foot thick, was\r\ncut right through by their constant impact, and apparently vanished\r\ndown some pipe beneath. Out of this metal basin Tommy, who gambolled\r\ninto the place ahead of us, began to drink in a greedy and\r\ndemonstrative fashion.\r\n\r\n“The Life-water?” I said, looking at our guide.\r\n\r\nShe nodded and asked in her turn:\r\n\r\n“What is the statue and what does it signify, Humphrey?”\r\n\r\nI hesitated, but Bastin answered:\r\n\r\n“Just a rather ugly woman who hid up her figure because it was bad.\r\nProbably she was a relation of the artist who wished to have her\r\nlikeness done and sat for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“The goddess of Health,” suggested Bickley. “Her proportions are\r\nperfect; a robust, a thoroughly normal woman.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Humphrey,” said Yva.\r\n\r\nI stared at the work and had not an idea. Then it flashed on me with\r\nsuch suddenness and certainty that I am convinced the answer to the\r\nriddle was passed to me from her and did not originate in my own mind.\r\n\r\n“It seems quite easy,” I said in a superior tone. “The figure\r\nsymbolises Life and is draped because we only see the face of Life, the\r\nrest is hidden. The arms are bare because Life is real and active. One\r\ncup is black and one is white because Life brings both good and evil\r\ngifts; that is why the streams mingle, to be lost beneath in the\r\ndarkness of death. The features are stern and even terrifying rather\r\nthan lovely, because such is the aspect of Life. The eyes look upward\r\nand far away from present things, because the real life is not here.”\r\n\r\n“Of course one may say anything,” said Bastin, “but I don’t understand\r\nall that.”\r\n\r\n“Imagination goes a long way,” broke in Bickley, who was vexed that he\r\nhad not thought of this interpretation himself. But Yva said:\r\n\r\n“I begin to think that you are quite clever, Humphrey. I wonder whence\r\nthe truth came to you, for such is the meaning of the figure and the\r\ncups. Had I told it to you myself, it could not have been better said,”\r\nand she glanced at me out of the corners of her eyes. “Now, Strangers,\r\nwill you drink? Once that gate was guarded, and only at a great price\r\nor as a great reward were certain of the Highest Blood given the\r\nfreedom of this fountain which might touch no common lips. Indeed it\r\nwas one of the causes of our last war, for all the world which was,\r\ndesired this water which now is lapped by a stranger’s hound.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose there is nothing medicinal in it?” said Bastin. “Once when I\r\nwas very thirsty, I made a mistake and drank three tumblers of\r\nsomething of the sort in the dark, thinking that it was Apollinaris,\r\nand I don’t want to do it again.”\r\n\r\n“Just the sort of thing you would do,” said Bickley. “But, Lady Yva,\r\nwhat are the properties of this water?”\r\n\r\n“It is very health-giving,” she answered, “and if drunk continually,\r\nnot less than once each thirty days, it wards off sickness, lessens\r\nhunger and postpones death for many, many years. That is why those of\r\nthe High Blood endured so long and became the rulers of the world, and\r\nthat, as I have said, is the greatest of the reasons why the peoples\r\nwho dwelt in the ancient outer countries and never wished to die, made\r\nwar upon them, to win this secret fountain. Have no fear, O Bastin, for\r\nsee, I will pledge you in this water.”\r\n\r\nThen she lifted a strange-looking, shallow, metal cup whereof the\r\nhandles were formed of twisted serpents, that lay in the basin, filled\r\nit from the trickling stream, bowed to us and drank. But as she drank I\r\nnoted with a thrill of joy that her eyes were fixed on mine as though\r\nit were me she pledged and me alone. Again she filled the cup with the\r\nsparkling water, for it did sparkle, like that French liqueur in which\r\nare mingled little flakes of gold, and handed it to me.\r\n\r\nI bowed to her and drank. I suppose the fluid was water, but to me it\r\ntasted more like strong champagne, dashed with Château Yquem. It was\r\ndelicious. More, its effects were distinctly peculiar. Something quick\r\nand subtle ran through my veins; something that for a few moments\r\nseemed to burn away the obscureness which blurs our thought. I began to\r\nunderstand several problems that had puzzled me, and then lost their\r\nexplanations in the midst of light, inner light, I mean. Moreover, of a\r\nsudden it seemed to me as though a window had been opened in the heart\r\nof that Glittering Lady who stood beside me. At least I knew that it\r\nwas full of wonderful knowledge, wonderful memories and wonderful\r\nhopes, and that in the latter two of these I had some part; what part I\r\ncould not tell. Also I knew that my heart was open to her and that she\r\nsaw in it something which caused her to marvel and to sigh.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds, thirty perhaps, all this was gone. Nothing remained\r\nexcept that I felt extremely strong and well, happier, too, than I had\r\nbeen for years. Mutely I asked her for more of the water, but she shook\r\nher head and, taking the cup from me, filled it again and gave it to\r\nBickley, who drank. He flushed, seemed to lose the self-control which\r\nwas his very strong characteristic, and said in a rather thick voice:\r\n\r\n“Curious! but I do not think at this moment there is any operation that\r\nhas ever been attempted which I could not tackle single-handed and with\r\nsuccess.”\r\n\r\nThen he was silent, and Bastin’s turn came. He drank rather noisily,\r\nafter his fashion, and began:\r\n\r\n“My dear young lady, I think the time has come when I should expound to\r\nyou—” Here he broke off and commenced singing very badly, for his voice\r\nwas somewhat raucous:\r\n\r\nFrom Greenland’s icy mountains,\r\nFrom India’s coral strand,\r\nWhere Afric’s sunny fountains\r\nRoll down their golden sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nCeasing from melody, he added:\r\n\r\n“I determined that I would drink nothing intoxicating while I was on\r\nthis island that I might be a shining light in a dark place, and now I\r\nfear that quite unwittingly I have broken what I look upon as a\r\npromise.”\r\n\r\nThen he, too, grew silent.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Yva, “my father, the Lord Oro, awaits you.”\r\n\r\nWe crossed the court of the Water of Life and mounted steps that led to\r\na wide and impressive portico, Tommy frisking ahead of us in a most\r\nexcited way for a dog of his experience. Evidently the water had\r\nproduced its effect upon him as well as upon his masters. This portico\r\nwas in a solemn style of architecture which I cannot describe, because\r\nit differed from any other that I know. It was not Egyptian and not\r\nGreek, although its solidity reminded me of the former, and the beauty\r\nand grace of some of the columns, of the latter. The profuseness and\r\nrather grotesque character of the carvings suggested the ruins of\r\nMexico and Yucatan, and the enormous size of the blocks of stone, those\r\nof Peru and Baalbec. In short, all the known forms of ancient\r\narchitecture might have found their inspiration here, and the general\r\neffect was tremendous.\r\n\r\n“The palace of the King,” said Yva, “whereof we approach the great\r\nhall.”\r\n\r\nWe entered through mighty metal doors, one of which stood ajar, into a\r\nvestibule which from certain indications I gathered had once been a\r\nguard, or perhaps an assembly-room. It was about forty feet deep by a\r\nhundred wide. Thence she led us through a smaller door into the hall\r\nitself. It was a vast place without columns, for there was no roof to\r\nsupport. The walls of marble or limestone were sculptured like those of\r\nEgyptian temples, apparently with battle scenes, though of this I am\r\nnot sure for I did not go near to them. Except for a broad avenue along\r\nthe middle, up which we walked, the area was filled with marble benches\r\nthat would, I presume, have accommodated several thousand people. But\r\nthey were empty—empty, and oh! the loneliness of it all.\r\n\r\nFar away at the head of the hall was a dais enclosed, and, as it were,\r\nroofed in by a towering structure that mingled grace and majesty to a\r\nwonderful degree. It was modelled on the pattern of a huge shell. The\r\nbase of the shell was the platform; behind were the ribs, and above,\r\nthe overhanging lip of the shell. On this platform was a throne of\r\nsilvery metal. It was supported on the arched coils of snakes, whereof\r\nthe tails formed the back and the heads the arms of the throne.\r\n\r\nOn this throne, arrayed in gorgeous robes, sat the Lord Oro, his white\r\nbeard flowing over them, and a jewelled cap upon his head. In front of\r\nhim was a low table on which lay graven sheets of metal, and among them\r\na large ball of crystal.\r\n\r\nThere he sat, solemn and silent in the midst of this awful solitude,\r\nlooking in very truth like a god, as we conceive such a being to\r\nappear. Small as he was in that huge expanse of buildings, he seemed\r\nyet to dominate it, in a sense to fill the emptiness which was\r\naccentuated by his presence. I know that the sight of him filled me\r\nwith true fear which it had never done in the light of day, not even\r\nwhen he arose from his crystal coffin. Now for the first time I felt as\r\nthough I were really in the presence of a Being Supernatural. Doubtless\r\nthe surroundings heightened this impression. What were these mighty\r\nedifices in the bowels of the world? Whence came this wondrous,\r\nall-pervading and translucent light, whereof we could see no origin?\r\nWhither had vanished those who had reared and inhabited them? How did\r\nit happen that of them all, this man, if he were a man; and this lovely\r\nwoman at my side, who, if I might trust my senses and instincts, was\r\ncertainly a woman, alone survived of their departed multitudes?\r\n\r\nThe thing was crushing. I looked at Bickley for encouragement, but got\r\nnone, for he only shook his head. Even Bastin, now that the first\r\neffects of the Life-water had departed, seemed overwhelmed, and\r\nmuttered something about the halls of Hades.\r\n\r\nOnly the little dog Tommy remained quite cheerful. He trotted down the\r\nhall, jumped on to the dais and sat himself comfortably at the feet of\r\nits occupant.\r\n\r\n“I greet you,” Oro said in his slow, resonant voice. “Daughter, lead\r\nthese strangers to me; I would speak with them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nOro in His House\r\n\r\n\r\nWe climbed on to the dais by some marble steps, and sat ourselves down\r\nin four curious chairs of metal that were more or less copied from that\r\nwhich served Oro as a throne; at least the arms ended in graven heads\r\nof snakes. These chairs were so comfortable that I concluded the seats\r\nwere fixed on springs, also we noticed that they were beautifully\r\npolished.\r\n\r\n“I wonder how they keep everything so clean,” said Bastin as we mounted\r\nthe dais. “In this big place it must take a lot of housemaids, though I\r\ndon’t see any. But perhaps there is no dust here.”\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders while we seated ourselves, the Lady Yva and I\r\non Oro’s right, Bickley and Bastin on his left, as he indicated by\r\npointing with his finger.\r\n\r\n“What say you of this city?” Oro asked after a while of me.\r\n\r\n“We do not know what to say,” I replied. “It amazes us. In our world\r\nthere is nothing like to it.”\r\n\r\n“Perchance there will be in the future when the nations grow more\r\nskilled in the arts of war,” said Oro darkly.\r\n\r\n“Be pleased, Lord Oro,” I went on, “if it is your will, to tell us why\r\nthe people who built this place chose to live in the bowels of the\r\nearth instead of upon its surface.”\r\n\r\n“They did not choose; it was forced upon them,” was the answer. “This\r\nis a city of refuge that they occupied in time of war, not because they\r\nhated the sun. In time of peace and before the Barbarians dared to\r\nattack them, they dwelt in the city Pani which signifies Above. You may\r\nhave noted some of its remaining ruins on the mount and throughout the\r\nisland. The rest of them are now beneath the sea. But when trouble came\r\nand the foe rained fire on them from the air, they retreated to this\r\ntown, Nyo, which signifies Beneath.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“And then they died. The Water of Life may prolong life, but it cannot\r\nmake women bear children. That they will only do beneath the blue of\r\nheaven, not deep in the belly of the world where Nature never designed\r\nthat they should dwell. How would the voices of children sound in such\r\nhalls as these? Tell me, you, Bickley, who are a physician.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot. I cannot imagine children in such a place, and if born here\r\nthey would die,” said Bickley.\r\n\r\nOro nodded.\r\n\r\n“They did die, and if they went above to Pani they were murdered. So\r\nsoon the habit of birth was lost and the Sons of Wisdom perished one by\r\none. Yes, they who ruled the world and by tens of thousands of years of\r\ntoil had gathered into their bosoms all the secrets of the world,\r\nperished, till only a few, and among them I and this daughter of mine,\r\nwere left.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“Then, Humphrey, having power so to do, I did what long I had\r\nthreatened, and unchained the forces that work at the world’s heart,\r\nand destroyed them who were my enemies and evil, so that they perished\r\nby millions, and with them all their works. Afterwards we slept,\r\nleaving the others, our subjects who had not the secret of this Sleep,\r\nto die, as doubtless they did in the course of Nature or by the hand of\r\nthe foe. The rest you know.”\r\n\r\n“Can such a thing happen again?” asked Bickley in a voice that did not\r\nhide his disbelief.\r\n\r\n“Why do you question me, Bickley, you who believe nothing of what I\r\ntell you, and therefore make wrath? Still I will say this, that what I\r\ncaused to happen I can cause once more—only once, I think—as perchance\r\nyou shall learn before all is done. Now, since you do not believe, I\r\nwill tell you no more of our mysteries, no, not whence this light comes\r\nnor what are the properties of the Water of Life, both of which you\r\nlong to know, nor how to preserve the vital spark of Being in the grave\r\nof dreamless sleep, like a live jewel in a casket of dead stone, nor\r\naught else. As to these matters, Daughter, I bid you also to be silent,\r\nsince Bickley mocks at us. Yes, with all this around him, he who saw us\r\nrise from the coffins, still mocks at us in his heart. Therefore let\r\nhim, this little man of a little day, when his few years are done go to\r\nthe tomb in ignorance, and his companions with him, they who might have\r\nbeen as wise as I am.”\r\n\r\nThus Oro spoke in a voice of icy rage, his deep eyes glowing like\r\ncoals. Hearing him I cursed Bickley in my heart for I was sure that\r\nonce spoken, his decree was like to that of the Medes and Persians and\r\ncould not be altered. Bickley, however, was not in the least dismayed.\r\nIndeed he argued the point. He told Oro straight out that he would not\r\nbelieve in the impossible until it had been shown to him to be\r\npossible, and that the law of Nature never had been and never could be\r\nviolated. It was no answer, he said, to show him wonders without\r\nexplaining their cause, since all that he seemed to see might be but\r\nmental illusions produced he knew not how.\r\n\r\nOro listened patiently, then answered:\r\n\r\n“Good. So be it, they are illusions. I am an illusion; those savages\r\nwho died upon the rock will tell you so. This fair woman before you is\r\nan illusion; Humphrey, I am sure, knows it as you will also before you\r\nhave done with her. These halls are illusions. Live on in your\r\nillusions, O little man of science, who because you see the face of\r\nthings, think that you know the body and the heart, and can read the\r\nsoul at work within. You are a worthy child of tens of thousands of\r\nyour breed who were before you and are now forgotten.”\r\n\r\nBickley looked up to answer, then changed his mind and was silent,\r\nthinking further argument dangerous, and Oro went on:\r\n\r\n“Now I differ from you, Bickley, in this way. I who have more wisdom in\r\nmy finger-point than you with all the physicians of your world added to\r\nyou, have in your brains and bodies, yet desire to learn from those who\r\ncan give me knowledge. I understand from your words to my daughter that\r\nyou, Bastin, teach a faith that is new to me, and that this faith tells\r\nof life eternal for the children of earth. Is it so?”\r\n\r\n“It is,” said Bastin eagerly. “I will set out—”\r\n\r\nOro cut him short with a wave of the hand.\r\n\r\n“Not now in the presence of Bickley who doubtless disbelieves your\r\nfaith, as he does all else, holding it with justice or without, to be\r\nbut another illusion. Yet you shall teach me and on it I will form my\r\nown judgment.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be delighted,” said Bastin. Then a doubt struck him, and he\r\nadded: “But why do you wish to learn? Not that you may make a mock of\r\nmy religion, is it?”\r\n\r\n“I mock at no man’s belief, because I think that what men believe is\r\ntrue—for them. I will tell you why I wish to hear of yours, since I\r\nnever hide the truth. I who am so wise and old, yet must die; though\r\nthat time may be far away, still I must die, for such is the lot of man\r\nborn of woman. And I do not desire to die. Therefore I shall rejoice to\r\nlearn of any faith that promises to the children of earth a life\r\neternal beyond the earth. Tomorrow you shall begin to teach me. Now\r\nleave me, Strangers, for I have much to do,” and he waved his hand\r\ntowards the table.\r\n\r\nWe rose and bowed, wondering what he could have to do down in this\r\nluminous hole, he who had been for so many thousands of years out of\r\ntouch with the world. It occurred to me, however, that during this long\r\nperiod he might have got in touch with other worlds, indeed he looked\r\nlike it.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” he said, “I have something to tell you. I have been studying\r\nthis book of writings, or world pictures,” and he pointed to my atlas\r\nwhich, as I now observed for the first time, was also lying upon the\r\ntable. “It interests me much. Your country is small, very small. When I\r\ncaused it to be raised up I think that it was larger, but since then\r\nthat seas have flowed in.”\r\n\r\nHere Bickley groaned aloud.\r\n\r\n“This one is much greater,” went on Oro, casting a glance at Bickley\r\nthat must have penetrated him like a searchlight. Then he opened the\r\nmap of Europe and with his finger indicated Germany and\r\nAustria-Hungary. “I know nothing of the peoples of these lands,” he\r\nadded, “but as you belong to one of them and are my guests, I trust\r\nthat yours may succeed in the war.”\r\n\r\n“What war?” we asked with one voice.\r\n\r\n“Since Bickley is so clever, surely he should know better than an\r\nillusion such as I. All I can tell you is that I have learned that\r\nthere is war between this country and that,” and he pointed to Great\r\nBritain and to Germany upon the map; “also between others.”\r\n\r\n“It is quite possible,” I said, remembering many things. “But how do\r\nyou know?”\r\n\r\n“If I told you, Humphrey, Bickley would not believe, so I will not\r\ntell. Perhaps I saw it in that crystal, as did the necromancers of the\r\nearly world. Or perhaps the crystal serves some different purpose and I\r\nsaw it otherwise—with my soul. At least what I say is true.”\r\n\r\n“Then who will win?” asked Bastin.\r\n\r\n“I cannot read the future, Preacher. If I could, should I ask you to\r\nexpound to me your religion which probably is of no more worth than a\r\nscore of others I have studied, just because it tells of the future? If\r\nI could read the future I should be a god instead of only an\r\nearth-lord.”\r\n\r\n“Your daughter called you a god and you said that you knew we were\r\ncoming to wake you up, which is reading the future,” answered Bastin.\r\n\r\n“Every father is a god to his daughter, or should be; also in my day\r\nmillions named me a god because I saw further and struck harder than\r\nthey could. As for the rest, it came to me in a vision. Oh! Bickley, if\r\nyou were wiser than you think you are, you would know that all things\r\nto come are born elsewhere and travel hither like the light from stars.\r\nSometimes they come faster before their day into a single mind, and\r\nthat is what men call prophecy. But this is a gift which cannot be\r\ncommanded, even by me. Also I did not know that you would come. I knew\r\nonly that we should awaken and by the help of men, for if none had been\r\npresent at that destined hour we must have died for lack of warmth and\r\nsustenance.”\r\n\r\n“I deny your hypothesis _in toto_,” exclaimed Bickley, but nobody paid\r\nany attention to him.\r\n\r\n“My father,” said Yva, rising and bowing before him with her swan-like\r\ngrace, “I have noted your commands. But do you permit that I show the\r\ntemple to these strangers, also something of our past?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” he said. “It will save much talk in a savage tongue that is\r\ndifficult to me. But bring them here no more without my command, save\r\nBastin only. When the sun is four hours high in the upper world, let\r\nhim come tomorrow to teach me, and afterwards if so I desire. Or if he\r\nwills, he can sleep here.”\r\n\r\n“I think I would rather not,” said Bastin hurriedly. “I make no\r\npretense to being particular, but this place does not appeal to me as a\r\nbedroom. There are degrees in the pleasures of solitude and, in short,\r\nI will not disturb your privacy at night.”\r\n\r\nOro waved his hand and we departed down that awful and most dreary\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n“I hope you will spend a pleasant time here, Bastin,” I said, looking\r\nback from the doorway at its cold, illuminated vastness.\r\n\r\n“I don’t expect to,” he answered, “but duty is duty, and if I can drag\r\nthat old sinner back from the pit that awaits him, it will be worth\r\ndoing. Only I have my doubts about him. To me he seems to bear a strong\r\nfamily resemblance to Beelzebub, and he’s a bad companion week in and\r\nweek out.”\r\n\r\nWe went through the portico, Yva leading us, and passed the fountain of\r\nLife-water, of which she cautioned us to drink no more at present, and\r\nto prevent him from doing so, dragged Tommy past it by his collar.\r\nBickley, however, lingered under the pretence of making a further\r\nexamination of the statue. As I had seen him emptying into his pocket\r\nthe contents of a corked bottle of quinine tabloids which he always\r\ncarried with him, I guessed very well that his object was to procure a\r\nsample of this water for future analysis. Of course I said nothing, and\r\nYva and Bastin took no note of what he was doing.\r\n\r\nWhen we were clear of the palace, of which we had only seen one hall,\r\nwe walked across an open space made unutterably dreary by the absence\r\nof any vegetation or other sign of life, towards a huge building of\r\nglorious proportions that was constructed of black stone or marble. It\r\nis impossible for me to give any idea of the frightful solemnity of\r\nthis domed edifice, for as I think I have said, it alone had a roof,\r\nstanding there in the midst of that brilliant, unvarying and most\r\nunnatural illumination which came from nowhere and yet was everywhere.\r\nThus, when one lifted a foot, there it was between the sole of the boot\r\nand the floor, or to express it better, the boot threw no shadow. I\r\nthink this absence of shadows was perhaps the most terrifying\r\ncircumstance connected with that universal and pervading light. Through\r\nit we walked on to the temple. We passed three courts, pillared all of\r\nthem, and came to the building which was larger than St. Paul’s in\r\nLondon. We entered through huge doors which still stood open, and\r\npresently found ourselves beneath the towering dome. There were no\r\nwindows, why should there be in a place that was full of light? There\r\nwas no ornamentation, there was nothing except black walls. And yet the\r\ngeneral effect was magnificent in its majestic grace.\r\n\r\n“In this place,” said Yva, and her sweet voice went whispering round\r\nthe walls and the arching dome, “were buried the Kings of the Sons of\r\nWisdom. They lie beneath, each in his sepulchre. Its entrance is\r\nyonder,” and she pointed to what seemed to be a chapel on the right.\r\n“Would you wish to see them?”\r\n\r\n“Somehow I don’t care to,” said Bastin. “The place is dreary enough as\r\nit is without the company of a lot of dead kings.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to dissect one of them, but I suppose that would not be\r\nallowed,” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered. “I think that the Lord Oro would not wish you to\r\ncut up his forefathers.”\r\n\r\n“When you and he went to sleep, why did you not choose the family\r\nvault?” asked Bastin.\r\n\r\n“Would you have found us there?” she queried by way of answer. Then,\r\nunderstanding that the invitation was refused by general consent,\r\nthough personally I should have liked to accept it, and have never\r\nceased regretting that I did not, she moved towards a colossal object\r\nwhich stood beneath the centre of the dome.\r\n\r\nOn a stepped base, not very different from that in the cave but much\r\nlarger, sat a figure, draped in a cloak on which was graved a number of\r\nstars, doubtless to symbolise the heavens. The fastening of the cloak\r\nwas shaped like the crescent moon, and the foot-stool on which rested\r\nthe figure’s feet was fashioned to suggest the orb of the sun. This was\r\nof gold or some such metal, the only spot of brightness in all that\r\ntemple. It was impossible to say whether the figure were male or\r\nfemale, for the cloak falling in long, straight folds hid its outlines.\r\nNor did the head tell us, for the hair also was hidden beneath the\r\nmantle and the face might have been that of either man or woman. It was\r\nterrible in its solemnity and calm, and its expression was as remote\r\nand mystic as that of Buddha, only more stern. Also without doubt it\r\nwas blind; it was impossible to mistake the sightlessness of those\r\nstaring orbs. Across the knees lay a naked sword and beneath the cloak\r\nthe arms were hidden. In its complete simplicity the thing was\r\nmarvelous.\r\n\r\nOn either side upon the pedestal knelt a figure of the size of life.\r\nOne was an old and withered man with death stamped upon his face; the\r\nother was a beautiful, naked woman, her hands clasped in the attitude\r\nof prayer and with vague terror written on her vivid features.\r\n\r\nSuch was this glorious group of which the meaning could not be\r\nmistaken. It was Fate throned upon the sun, wearing the constellations\r\nas his garment, armed with the sword of Destiny and worshipped by Life\r\nand Death. This interpretation I set out to the others.\r\n\r\nYva knelt before the statue for a little while, bowing her head in\r\nprayer, and really I felt inclined to follow her example, though in the\r\nend I compromised, as did Bickley, by taking off my hat, which, like\r\nthe others, I still wore from force of habit, though in this place none\r\nwere needed. Only Bastin remained covered.\r\n\r\n“Behold the god of my people,” said Yva. “Have you no reverence for it,\r\nO Bastin?”\r\n\r\n“Not much,” he answered, “except as a work of art. You see I worship\r\nFate’s Master. I might add that _your_ god doesn’t seem to have done\r\nmuch for you, Lady Yva, as out of all your greatness there’s nothing\r\nleft but two people and a lot of old walls and caves.”\r\n\r\nAt first she was inclined to be angry, for I saw her start. Then her\r\nmood changed, and she said with a sigh:\r\n\r\n“Fate’s Master! Where does He dwell?”\r\n\r\n“Here amongst other places,” said Bastin. “I’ll soon explain that to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you,” she replied gravely. “But why have you not explained it\r\nto Bickley?” Then waving her hand to show that she wished for no\r\nanswer, she went on:\r\n\r\n“Friends, would you wish to learn something of the history of my\r\npeople?”\r\n\r\n“Very much,” said the irrepressible Bastin, “but I would rather the\r\nlecture took place in the open air.”\r\n\r\n“That is not possible,” she answered. “It must be here and now, or not\r\nat all. Come, stand by me. Be silent and do not move. I am about to set\r\nloose forces that are dangerous if disturbed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nVisions of the Past\r\n\r\n\r\nShe led us to the back of the statue and pointed to each of us where we\r\nshould remain. Then she took her place at right angles to us, as a\r\nshowman might do, and for a while stood immovable. Watching her face,\r\nonce more I saw it, and indeed all her body, informed with that strange\r\nair of power, and noted that her eyes flashed and that her hair grew\r\neven more brilliant than was common, as though some abnormal strength\r\nwere flowing through it and her. Presently she spoke, saying:\r\n\r\n“I shall show you first our people in the day of their glory. Look in\r\nfront of you.”\r\n\r\nWe looked and by degrees the vast space of the apse before us became\r\nalive with forms. At first these were vague and shadowy, not to be\r\nseparated or distinguished. Then they became so real that until he was\r\nreproved by a kick, Tommy growled at them and threatened to break out\r\ninto one of his peals of barking.\r\n\r\nA wonderful scene appeared. There was a palace of white marble and in\r\nfront of it a great courtyard upon which the sun beat vividly. At the\r\nfoot of the steps of the palace, beneath a silken awning, sat a king\r\nenthroned, a crown upon his head and wearing glorious robes. In his\r\nhand was a jewelled sceptre. He was a noble-looking man of middle age\r\nand about him were gathered the glittering officers of his court. Fair\r\nwomen fanned him and to right and left, but a little behind, sat other\r\nfair and jewelled women who, I suppose, were his wives or daughters.\r\n\r\n“One of the Kings of the Children of Wisdom new-crowned, receives the\r\nhomage of the world,” said Yva.\r\n\r\nAs she spoke there appeared, walking in front of the throne one by one,\r\nother kings, for all were crowned and bore sceptres. At the foot of the\r\nthrone each of them kneeled and kissed the foot of him who sat thereon,\r\nas he did so laying down his sceptre which at a sign he lifted again\r\nand passed away. Of these kings there must have been quite fifty, men\r\nof all colours and of various types, white men, black men, yellow men,\r\nred men.\r\n\r\nThen came their ministers bearing gifts, apparently of gold and jewels,\r\nwhich were piled on trays in front of the throne. I remember noting an\r\nincident. An old fellow with a lame leg stumbled and upset his tray, so\r\nthat the contents rolled hither and thither. His attempts to recover\r\nthem were ludicrous and caused the monarch on the throne to relax from\r\nhis dignity and smile. I mention this to show that what we witnessed\r\nwas no set scene but apparently a living piece of the past. Had it been\r\nso the absurdity of the bedizened old man tumbling down in the midst of\r\nthe gorgeous pageant would certainly have been omitted.\r\n\r\nNo, it must be life, real life, something that had happened, and the\r\nsame may be said of what followed. For instance, there was what we call\r\na review. Infantry marched, some of them armed with swords and spears,\r\nthough these I took to be an ornamental bodyguard, and others with\r\ntubes like savage blowpipes of which I could not guess the use. There\r\nwere no cannon, but carriages came by loaded with bags that had spouts\r\nto them. Probably these were charged with poisonous gases. There were\r\nsome cavalry also, mounted on a different stamp of horse from ours,\r\nthicker set and nearer the ground, but with arched necks and fiery eyes\r\nand, I should say, very strong. These again, I take it, were\r\nornamental. Then came other men upon a long machine, slung in pairs in\r\narmoured sacks, out of which only their heads and arms projected. This\r\nmachine, which resembled an elongated bicycle, went by at a tremendous\r\nrate, though whence its motive power came did not appear. It carried\r\ntwenty pairs of men, each of whom held in his hand some small but\r\ndoubtless deadly weapon, that in appearance resembled an orange. Other\r\nsimilar machines which followed carried from forty to a hundred pairs\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nThe marvel of the piece, however, were the aircraft. These came by in\r\ngreat numbers. Sometimes they flew in flocks like wild geese, sometimes\r\nsingly, sometimes in line and sometimes in ordered squadrons, with\r\noutpost and officer ships and an exact distance kept between craft and\r\ncraft. None of them seemed to be very large or to carry more than four\r\nor five men, but they were extraordinarily swift and as agile as\r\nswallows. Moreover they flew as birds do by beating their wings, but\r\nagain we could not guess whence came their motive power.\r\n\r\nThe review vanished, and next appeared a scene of festivity in a huge,\r\nilluminated hall. The Great King sat upon a dais and behind him was\r\nthat statue of Fate, or one very similar to it, beneath which we stood.\r\nBelow him in the hall were the feasters seated at long tables, clad in\r\nthe various costumes of their countries. He rose and, turning, knelt\r\nbefore the statue of Fate. Indeed he prostrated himself thrice in\r\nprayer. Then taking his seat again, he lifted a cup of wine and pledged\r\nthat vast company. They drank back to him and prostrated themselves\r\nbefore him as he had done before the image of Fate. Only I noted that\r\ncertain men clad in sacerdotal garments not at all unlike those which\r\nare worn in the Greek Church to-day, remained standing.\r\n\r\nNow all this exhibition of terrestrial pomp faded. The next scene was\r\nsimple, that of the death-bed of this same king—we knew him by his\r\nwizened features. There he lay, terribly old and dying. Physicians,\r\nwomen, courtiers, all were there watching the end. The tableau vanished\r\nand in place of it appeared that of the youthful successor amidst\r\ncheering crowds, with joy breaking through the clouds of simulated\r\ngrief upon his face. It vanished also.\r\n\r\n“Thus did great king succeed great king for ages upon ages,” said Yva.\r\n“There were eighty of them and the average of their reigns was 700\r\nyears. They ruled the earth as it was in those days. They gathered up\r\nlearning, they wielded power, their wealth was boundless. They nurtured\r\nthe arts, they discovered secrets. They had intercourse with the stars;\r\nthey were as gods. But like the gods they grew jealous. They and their\r\ncouncillors became a race apart who alone had the secret of long life.\r\nThe rest of the world and the commonplace people about them suffered\r\nand died. They of the Household of Wisdom lived on in pomp for\r\ngenerations till the earth was mad with envy of them.\r\n\r\n“Fewer and fewer grew the divine race of the Sons of Wisdom since\r\nchildren are not given to the aged and to those of an ancient, outworn\r\nblood. Then the World said:\r\n\r\n“‘They are great but they are not many; let us make an end of them by\r\nnumbers and take their place and power and drink of their Life-water,\r\nthat they will not give to us. If myriads of us perish by their arts,\r\nwhat does it matter, since we are countless?’ So the World made war\r\nupon the Sons of Wisdom. See!”\r\n\r\nAgain a picture formed. The sky was full of aircraft which rained down\r\nfire like flashes of lightning upon cities beneath. From these cities\r\nleapt up other fires that destroyed the swift-travelling things above,\r\nso that they fell in numbers like gnats burned by a lamp. Still more\r\nand more of them came till the cities crumbled away and the flashes\r\nthat darted from them ceased to rush upwards. The Sons of Wisdom were\r\ndriven from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nAgain the scene changed. Now it showed this subterranean hall in which\r\nwe stood. There was pomp here, yet it was but a shadow of that which\r\nhad been in the earlier days upon the face of the earth. Courtiers\r\nmoved about the palace and there were people in the radiant streets and\r\nthe houses, for most of them were occupied, but rarely did the vision\r\nshow children coming through their gates.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden this scene shifted. Now we saw that same hall in which we\r\nhad visited Oro not an hour before. There he sat, yes, Oro himself,\r\nupon the dais beneath the overhanging marble shell. Round him were some\r\nancient councillors. In the body of the hall on either side of the dais\r\nwere men in military array, guards without doubt though their only\r\nweapon was a black rod not unlike a ruler, if indeed it were a weapon\r\nand not a badge of office.\r\n\r\nYva, whose face had suddenly grown strange and fixed, began to detail\r\nto us what was passing in this scene, in a curious monotone such as a\r\nperson might use who was repeating something learned by heart. This was\r\nthe substance of what she said:\r\n\r\n“The case of the Sons of Wisdom is desperate. But few of them are left.\r\nLike other men they need food which is hard to come by, since the foe\r\nholds the upper earth and that which their doctors can make here in the\r\nShades does not satisfy them, even though they drink the Life-water.\r\nThey die and die. There comes an embassy from the High King of the\r\nconfederated Nations to talk of terms of peace. See, it enters.”\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, up the hall advanced the embassy. At the head of it\r\nwalked a young man, tall, dark, handsome and commanding, whose aspect\r\nseemed in some way to be familiar to me. He was richly clothed in a\r\npurple cloak and wore upon his head a golden circlet that suggested\r\nroyal rank. Those who followed him were mostly old men who had the\r\nastute faces of diplomatists, but a few seemed to be generals. Yva\r\ncontinued in her monotonous voice:\r\n\r\n“Comes the son of the King of the confederated Nations, the Prince who\r\nwill be king. He bows before the Lord Oro. He says ‘Great and Ancient\r\nMonarch of the divine blood, Heaven-born One, your strait, and that of\r\nthose who remain to you, is sore. Yet on behalf of the Nations I am\r\nsent to offer terms of peace, but this I may only do in the presence of\r\nyour child who is your heiress and the Queen-to-be of the Sons of\r\nWisdom.’”\r\n\r\nHere, in the picture, Oro waved his hand and from behind the marble\r\nshell appeared Yva herself, gloriously apparelled, wearing royal\r\nornaments and with her train held by waiting ladies. She bowed to the\r\nPrince and his company and they bowed back to her. More, we saw a\r\nglance of recognition pass between her and the Prince.\r\n\r\nNow the real Yva by our side pointed to the shadow Yva of the vision or\r\nthe picture, whichever it might be called, a strange thing to see her\r\ndo, and went on:\r\n\r\n“The daughter of the Lord Oro comes. The Prince of the Nations salutes\r\nher. He says that the great war has endured for hundreds of years\r\nbetween the Children of Wisdom fighting for absolute rule and the\r\ncommon people of the earth fighting for liberty. In that war many\r\nmillions of the Sons of the Nations had perished, brought to their\r\ndeath by fearful arts, by wizardries and by plagues sown among them by\r\nthe Sons of Wisdom. Yet they were winning, for the glorious cities of\r\nthe Sons of Wisdom were destroyed and those who remained of them were\r\ndriven to dwell in the caves of the earth where with all their strength\r\nand magic they could not increase, but faded like flowers in the dark.\r\n\r\n“The Lord Oro asks what are the terms of peace proposed by the Nations.\r\nThe Prince answers that they are these: That the Sons of Wisdom shall\r\nteach all their wisdom to the wise men among the Nations. That they\r\nshall give them to drink of the Life-water, so that their length of\r\ndays also may be increased. That they shall cease to destroy them by\r\nsickness and their mastery of the forces which are hid in the womb of\r\nthe world. If they will do these things, then the Nations on their part\r\nwill cease from war, will rebuild the cities they have destroyed by\r\nmeans of their flying ships that rain down death, and will agree that\r\nthe Lord Oro and his seed shall rule them for ever as the King of\r\nkings.\r\n\r\n“The Lord Oro asks if that be all. The Prince answers that it is not\r\nall. He says that when he dwelt a hostage at the court of the Sons of\r\nWisdom he and the divine Lady, the daughter of the Lord Oro, and his\r\nonly living child, learned to love each other. He demands, and the\r\nNations demand, that she shall be given to him to wife, that in a day\r\nto come he may rule with her and their children after them.\r\n\r\n“See!” went on Yva in her chanting, dreamy voice, “the Lord Oro asks\r\nhis daughter if this be true. She says,” here the real Yva at my side\r\nturned and looked me straight in the eyes, “that it is true; that she\r\nloves the Prince of the Nations and that if she lives a million years\r\nshe will wed no other man, since she who is her father’s slave in all\r\nelse is still the mistress of herself, as has ever been the right of\r\nher royal mothers.\r\n\r\n“See again! The Lord Oro, the divine King, the Ancient, grows wroth. He\r\nsays that it is enough and more than enough that the Barbarians should\r\nask to eat of the bread of hidden learning and to drink of the\r\nLife-water of the Sons of Wisdom, gifts that were given to them of old\r\nby Heaven whence they sprang in the beginning. But that one of them,\r\nhowever highly placed, should dare to ask to mix his blood with that of\r\nthe divine Lady, the Heiress, the Queen of the Earth to be, and claim\r\nto share her imperial throne that had been held by her pure race from\r\nage to age, was an insult that could only be purged by death. Sooner\r\nwould he give his daughter in marriage to an ape than to a child of the\r\nBarbarians who had worked on them so many woes and striven to break the\r\ngolden fetters of their rule.\r\n\r\n“Look again!” continued Yva. “The Lord Oro, the divine, grows angrier\r\nstill” (which in truth he did, for never did I see such dreadful rage\r\nas that which the picture revealed in him). “He warns, he threatens. He\r\nsays that hitherto out of gentle love and pity he has held his hand;\r\nthat he has strength at his command which will slay them, not by\r\nmillions in slow war, but by tens of millions at one blow; that will\r\nblot them and their peoples from the face of earth and that will cause\r\nthe deep seas to roll where now their pleasant lands are fruitful in\r\nthe sun. They shrink before his fury; behold, their knees tremble\r\nbecause they know that he has this power. He mocks them, does the Lord\r\nOro. He asks for their submission here and now, and that in the name of\r\nthe Nations they should take the great oath which may not be broken,\r\nswearing to cease from war upon the Sons of Wisdom and to obey them in\r\nall things to the ends of the earth. Some of the ambassadors would\r\nyield. They look about them like wild things that are trapped. But\r\nmadness takes the Prince. He cries that the oath of an ape is of no\r\naccount, but that he will tear up the Children of Wisdom as an ape\r\ntears leaves, and afterwards take the divine Lady to be his wife.\r\n\r\n“Look on the Lord Oro!” continued the living Yva, “his wrath leaves\r\nhim. He grows cold and smiles. His daughter throws herself upon her\r\nknees and pleads with him. He thrusts her away. She would spring to the\r\nside of the Prince; he commands his councillors to hold her. She cries\r\nto the Prince that she loves him and him only, and that in a day to\r\ncome him she will wed and no other. He thanks her, saying that as it is\r\nwith her, so it is with him, and that because of his love he fears\r\nnothing. She swoons. The Lord Oro motions with his hand to the guard.\r\nThey lift their death-rods. Fire leaps from them. The Prince and his\r\ncompanions, all save those who were afraid and would have sworn the\r\noath, twist and writhe. They turn black; they die. The Lord Oro\r\ncommands those who are left to enter their flying ships and bear to the\r\nNations of the Earth tidings of what befalls those who dare to defy and\r\ninsult him; to warn them also to eat and drink and be merry while they\r\nmay, since for their wickedness they are about to perish.”\r\n\r\nThe scene faded and there followed another which really I cannot\r\ndescribe. It represented some vast underground place and what appeared\r\nto be a huge mountain of iron clothed in light, literally a thing like\r\nan alp, rocking and spinning down a declivity, which farther on\r\nseparated into two branches because of a huge razor-edge precipice that\r\nrose between. There in the middle of this vast space with the dazzling\r\nmountain whirling towards him, stood Oro encased in some transparent\r\narmour, as though to keep off heat, and with him his daughter who under\r\nhis direction was handling something in the rock behind her. Then there\r\nwas a blinding flash and everything vanished. All of this picture\r\npassed so swiftly that we could not grasp its details; only a general\r\nimpression remained.\r\n\r\n“The Lord Oro, using the strength that is in the world whereof he alone\r\nhas the secret, changes the world’s balance causing that which was land\r\nto become sea and that which was sea to become land,” said Yva in her\r\nchanting, unnatural voice.\r\n\r\nAnother scene of stupendous and changing awfulness. Countries were\r\nsinking, cities crashing down, volcanoes were spouting fire; the end of\r\nthe earth seemed to be at hand. We could see human beings running to\r\nand fro in thousands like ants. Then in huge waves hundreds and\r\nhundreds of feet high, the ocean flowed in and all was troubled, yeasty\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n“Oro carries out his threat to destroy the Nations who had rebelled\r\nagainst him,” said Yva. “Much of the world sinks beneath the waves, but\r\nin place of it other lands arise above the waves, to be inhabited by\r\nthe seed of those who remain living in those portions of the Earth that\r\nthe deluge spared.”\r\n\r\nThis horrible vision passed and was succeeded by one more, that of Oro\r\nstanding in the sepulchre of the cave by the side of the crystal coffin\r\nwhich contained what appeared to be the body of his daughter. He gazed\r\nat her, then drank some potion and laid himself down in the companion\r\ncoffin, that in which we had found him.\r\n\r\nAll vanished away and Yva, appearing to wake from some kind of trance,\r\nsmiled, and in her natural voice asked if we had seen enough.\r\n\r\n“Quite,” I answered in a tone that caused her to say:\r\n\r\n“I wonder what you have seen, Humphrey. Myself I do not know, since it\r\nis through me that you see at all and when you see I am in you who\r\nsee.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” I replied. “Well, I will tell you about it later.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you so much,” exclaimed Bastin, recovering suddenly from his\r\namazement. “I have heard a great deal of these moving-picture shows\r\nwhich are becoming so popular, but have always avoided attending them\r\nbecause their influence on the young is supposed to be doubtful, and a\r\npriest must set a good example to his congregation. Now I see that they\r\ncan have a distinct educational value, even if it is presented in the\r\nform of romance.”\r\n\r\n“How is it done?” asked Bickley, almost fiercely.\r\n\r\n“I do not altogether know,” she answered. “This I do know, however,\r\nthat everything which has happened on this world can be seen from\r\nmoment to moment at some point in the depths of space, for thither the\r\nsun’s light takes it. There, too, it can be caught and thence in an\r\ninstant returned to earth again, to be reflected in the mirror of the\r\npresent by those who know how that mirror should be held. Ask me no\r\nmore; one so wise as you, O Bickley, can solve such problems for\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mind, Lady Yva,” said Bastin, “I think I should like to\r\nget out of this place, interesting as it is. I have food to cook up\r\nabove and lots of things to attend to, especially as I understand I am\r\nto come back here tomorrow. Would you mind showing me the way to that\r\nlift or moving staircase?”\r\n\r\n“Come,” she said, smiling.\r\n\r\nSo we went past the image of Fate, out of the temple, down the vast and\r\nlonely streets so unnaturally illuminated, to the place where we had\r\nfirst found ourselves on arrival in the depths. There we stood.\r\n\r\nA moment later and we were whirling up as we had whirled down. I\r\nsuppose that Yva came with us though I never saw her do so, and the odd\r\nthing was that when we arrived in the sepulchre, she seemed already to\r\nbe standing there waiting to direct us.\r\n\r\n“Really,” remarked Bastin, “this is exactly like Maskelyne and Cook.\r\nDid you ever see their performance, Bickley? If so, it must have given\r\nyou lots to explain for quite a long while.”\r\n\r\n“Jugglery never appealed to me, whether in London or in Orofena,”\r\nreplied Bickley in a sour voice as he extracted from his pocket an end\r\nof candle to which he set light.\r\n\r\n“What is jugglery?” asked Bastin, and they departed arguing, leaving me\r\nalone with Yva in the sepulchre.\r\n\r\n“What have I seen?” I asked her.\r\n\r\n“I do not know, Humphrey. Everyone sees different things, but perhaps\r\nsomething of the truth.”\r\n\r\n“I hope not, Yva, for amongst other things I seemed to see you swear\r\nyourself to a man for ever.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and this I did. What of it?”\r\n\r\n“Only that it might be hard for another man.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for another man it might be hard. You were once married, were you\r\nnot, Humphrey, to a wife who died?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I was married.”\r\n\r\n“And did you not swear to that wife that you would never look in love\r\nupon another woman?”\r\n\r\n“I did,” I answered in a shamed voice. “But how do you know? I never\r\ntold you so.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I know you and therefore guessed.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what of it, Yva?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, except that you must find your wife before you love again,\r\nand before I love again I must find him whom I wish to be my husband.”\r\n\r\n“How can that happen,” I asked, “when both are dead?”\r\n\r\n“How did all that you have seen to-day in Nyo happen?” she replied,\r\nlaughing softly. “Perhaps you are very blind, Humphrey, or perhaps we\r\nboth are blind. If so, mayhap light will come to us. Meanwhile do not\r\nbe sad. Tomorrow I will meet you and you shall teach me—your English\r\ntongue, Humphrey, and other things.”\r\n\r\n“Then let it be in the sunlight, Yva. I do not love those darksome\r\nhalls of Nyo that glow like something dead.”\r\n\r\n“It is fitting, for are they not dead?” she answered, with a little\r\nlaugh. “So be it. Bastin shall teach my father down below, since sun\r\nand shade are the same to him who only thinks of his religion, and you\r\nshall teach me up above.”\r\n\r\n“I am not so certain about Bastin and of what he thinks,” I said\r\ndoubtfully. “Also will the Lord Oro permit you to come?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for in such matters I rule myself. Also,” she added meaningly,\r\n“he remembers my oath that I will wed no man—save one who is dead. Now\r\nfarewell a while and bid Bastin be here when the sun is three hours\r\nhigh, not before or after.”\r\n\r\nThen I left her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nYva Explains\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the rock I was pleased to find Marama and about twenty\r\nof his people engaged in erecting the house that we had ordered them to\r\nbuild for our accommodation. Indeed, it was nearly finished, since\r\nhouse-building in Orofena is a simple business. The framework of poles\r\nlet into palm trunks, since they could not be driven into the rock, had\r\nbeen put together on the further shore and towed over bodily by canoes.\r\nThe overhanging rock formed one side of the house; the ends were of\r\npalm leaves tied to the poles, and the roof was of the same material.\r\nThe other side was left open for the present, which in that equable and\r\nbalmy clime was no disadvantage. The whole edifice was about thirty\r\nfeet long by fifteen deep and divided into two portions, one for\r\nsleeping and one for living, by a palm leaf partition. Really, it was\r\nquite a comfortable abode, cool and rainproof, especially after Bastin\r\nhad built his hut in which to cook.\r\n\r\nMarama and his people were very humble in their demeanour and implored\r\nus to visit them on the main island. I answered that perhaps we would\r\nlater on, as we wished to procure certain things from the wreck. Also,\r\nhe requested Bastin to continue his ministrations as the latter greatly\r\ndesired to do. But to this proposal I would not allow him to give any\r\ndirect answer at the moment. Indeed, I dared not do so until I was sure\r\nof Oro’s approval.\r\n\r\nTowards evening they departed in their canoes, leaving behind them the\r\nusual ample store of provisions.\r\n\r\nWe cooked our meal as usual, only to discover that what Yva had said\r\nabout the Life-water was quite true, since we had but little appetite\r\nfor solid food, though this returned upon the following day. The same\r\nthing happened upon every occasion after drinking of that water which\r\ncertainly was a most invigorating fluid. Never for years had any of us\r\nfelt so well as it caused us to do.\r\n\r\nSo we lit our pipes and talked about our experiences though of these,\r\nindeed, we scarcely knew what to say. Bastin accepted them as something\r\nout of the common, of course, but as facts which admitted of no\r\ndiscussion. After all, he said, the Old Testament told much the same\r\nstory of people called the Sons of God who lived very long lives and\r\nran after the daughters of men whom they should have left alone, and\r\nthus became the progenitors of a remarkable race. Of this race, he\r\npresumed that Oro and his daughter were survivors, especially as they\r\nspoke of their family as “Heaven born.” How they came to survive was\r\nmore than he could understand and really scarcely worth bothering over,\r\nsince there they were.\r\n\r\nIt was the same about the Deluge, continued Bastin, although naturally\r\nOro spoke falsely, or, at any rate, grossly exaggerated, when he\r\ndeclared that he had caused this catastrophe, unless indeed he was\r\ntalking about a totally different deluge, though even then _he_ could\r\nnot have brought it about. It was curious, however, that the people\r\ndrowned were said to have been wicked, and Oro had the same opinion\r\nabout those whom he claimed to have drowned, though for the matter of\r\nthat, he could not conceive anyone more wicked than Oro himself. On his\r\nown showing he was a most revengeful person and one who declined to\r\nagree to a quite suitable alliance, apparently desired by both parties,\r\nmerely because it offended his family pride. No, on reflection he might\r\nbe unjust to Oro in this particular, since _he_ never told that story;\r\nit was only shown in some pictures which very likely were just made up\r\nto astonish us. Meanwhile, it was his business to preach to this old\r\nsinner down in that hole, and he confessed honestly that he did not\r\nlike the job. Still, it must be done, so with our leave he would go\r\napart and seek inspiration, which at present seemed to be quite\r\nlacking.\r\n\r\nThus declaimed Bastin and departed.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you tell your opinion about the Deluge or he may cause another\r\njust to show that you are wrong,” called Bickley after him.\r\n\r\n“I can’t help that,” answered Bastin. “Certainly I shall not hide the\r\ntruth to save Oro’s feelings, if he has got any. If he revenges himself\r\nupon us in any way, we must just put up with it like other martyrs.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t the slightest ambition to be a martyr,” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“No,” shouted Bastin from a little distance, “I am quite aware of that,\r\nas you have often said so before. Therefore, if you become one, I am\r\nsorry to say that I do not see how you can expect any benefit. You\r\nwould only be like a man who puts a sovereign into the offertory bag in\r\nmistake for a shilling. The extra nineteen shillings will do him no\r\ngood at all, since in his heart he regrets the error and wishes that he\r\ncould have them back.”\r\n\r\nThen he departed, leaving me laughing. But Bickley did not laugh.\r\n\r\n“Arbuthnot,” he said, “I have come to the conclusion that I have gone\r\nquite mad. I beg you if I should show signs of homicidal mania, which I\r\nfeel developing in me where Bastin is concerned, or of other abnormal\r\nviolence, that you will take whatever steps you consider necessary,\r\neven to putting me out of the way if that is imperative.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I asked. “You seem sane enough.”\r\n\r\n“Sane, when I believe that I have seen and experienced a great number\r\nof things which I know it to be quite impossible that I should have\r\nseen or experienced. The only explanation is that I am suffering from\r\ndelusions.”\r\n\r\n“Then is Bastin suffering from delusions, too?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, but that is nothing new in his case.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t agree with you, Bickley—about Bastin, I mean. I am by no means\r\ncertain that he is not the wisest of the three of us. He has a faith\r\nand he sticks to it, as millions have done before him, and that is\r\nbetter than making spiritual experiments, as I am sorry to say I do, or\r\nrejecting things because one cannot understand them, as you do, which\r\nis only a form of intellectual vanity.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t argue the matter, Arbuthnot; it is of no use. I repeat that I\r\nam mad, and Bastin is mad.”\r\n\r\n“How about me? I also saw and experienced these things. Am I mad, too?”\r\n\r\n“You ought to be, Arbuthnot. If it isn’t enough to drive a man mad when\r\nhe sees himself exactly reproduced in an utterly impossible\r\nmoving-picture show exhibited by an utterly impossible young woman in\r\nan utterly impossible underground city, then I don’t know what is.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I asked, starting.\r\n\r\n“Mean? Well, if you didn’t notice it, there’s hope for you.”\r\n\r\n“Notice what?”\r\n\r\n“All that envoy scene. There, as I thought, appeared Yva. Do you admit\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“Of course; there could be no mistake on that point.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. Then according to my version there came a man, still young,\r\ndressed in outlandish clothes, who made propositions of peace and\r\nwanted to marry Yva, who wanted to marry him. Is that right?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and didn’t you recognise the man?”\r\n\r\n“No; I only noticed that he was a fine-looking fellow whose appearance\r\nreminded me of someone.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it must be true,” mused Bickley, “that we do not know\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\n“So the old Greek thought, since he urged that this should be our\r\nspecial study. ‘Know thyself,’ you remember.”\r\n\r\n“I meant physically, not intellectually. Arbuthnot, do you mean to tell\r\nme that you did not recognise your own double in that man? Shave off\r\nyour beard and put on his clothes and no one could distinguish you\r\napart.”\r\n\r\nI sprang up, dropping my pipe.\r\n\r\n“Now you mention it,” I said slowly, “I suppose there was a\r\nresemblance. I didn’t look at him very much; I was studying the\r\nsimulacrum of Yva. Also, you know it is some time since—I mean, there\r\nare no pier-glasses in Orofena.”\r\n\r\n“The man was _you_,” went on Bickley with conviction. “If I were\r\nsuperstitious I should think it a queer sort of omen. But as I am not,\r\nI know that I must be mad.”\r\n\r\n“Why? After all, an ancient man and a modern man might resemble each\r\nother.”\r\n\r\n“There are degrees in resemblance,” said Bickley with one of his\r\ncontemptuous snorts. “It won’t do, Humphrey, my boy,” he added. “I can\r\nonly think of one possible explanation—outside of the obvious one of\r\nmadness.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“The Glittering Lady produced what Bastin called that cinematograph\r\nshow in some way or other, did she not? She said that in order to do\r\nthis she loosed some hidden forces. I suggest that she did nothing of\r\nthe sort.”\r\n\r\n“Then whence did the pictures come and why?”\r\n\r\n“From her own brain, in order to impress us with a cock-and-bull,\r\nfairy-book story. If this were so she would quite naturally fill the\r\nrole of the lover of the piece with the last man who had happened to\r\nimpress her. Hence the resemblance.”\r\n\r\n“You presuppose a great deal, Bickley, including supernatural cunning\r\nand unexampled hypnotic influence. I don’t know, first, why she should\r\nbe so anxious to add another impression to the many we have received in\r\nthis place; and, secondly, if she was, how she managed to mesmerise\r\nthree average but totally different men into seeing the same things.\r\n_My_ explanation is that you were deceived as to the likeness, which,\r\nmind you, I did not recognise; nor, apparently, did Bastin.”\r\n\r\n“Bastin never recognises anything. But if you are in doubt, ask Yva\r\nherself. She ought to know. Now I’m off to try to analyse that\r\nconfounded Life-water, which I suspect is of the ordinary spring\r\nvariety, lightened up with natural carbonic acid gas and possibly not\r\nuninfluenced by radium. The trouble is that here I can only apply some\r\nvery elementary tests.”\r\n\r\nSo he went also, in an opposite direction to Bastin, and I was left\r\nalone with Tommy, who annoyed me much by attempting continually to\r\nwander off into the cave, whence I must recall him. I suppose that my\r\nexperiences of the day, reviewed beneath the sweet influences of the\r\nwonderful tropical night, affected me. At any rate, that mystical side\r\nof my nature, to which I think I alluded at the beginning of this\r\nrecord, sprang into active and, in a sense, unholy life. The normal\r\nvanished, the abnormal took possession, and that is unholy to most of\r\nus creatures of habit and tradition, at any rate, if we are British. I\r\nlost my footing on the world; my spirit began to wander in strange\r\nplaces; of course, always supposing that we have a spirit, which\r\nBickley would deny.\r\n\r\nI gave up reason; I surrendered myself to unreason; it is a not\r\nunpleasant process, occasionally. Supposing now that all we see and\r\naccept is but the merest fragment of the truth, or perhaps only a\r\nrefraction thereof? Supposing that we do live again and again, and that\r\nour animating principle, whatever it might be, does inhabit various\r\nbodies, which, naturally enough, it would shape to its own taste and\r\nlikeness? Would that taste and likeness vary so very much over, let us\r\nsay, a million years or so, which, after all, is but an hour, or a\r\nminute, in the æons of Eternity?\r\n\r\nOn this hypothesis, which is so wild that one begins to suspect that it\r\nmay be true, was it impossible that I and that murdered man of the far\r\npast were in fact identical? If the woman were the same, preserved\r\nacross the gulf in some unknown fashion, why should not her lover be\r\nthe same? What did I say—her lover? Was I her lover? No, I was the\r\nlover of one who had died—my lost wife. Well, if I had died and lived\r\nagain, why should not—why should not that Sleeper—have lived again\r\nduring her long sleep? Through all those years the spirit must have had\r\nsome home, and, if so, in what shapes did it live? There were points,\r\nsimilarities, which rushed in upon me—oh! it was ridiculous. Bickley\r\nwas right. We were all mad!\r\n\r\nThere was another thing. Oro had declared that we were at war with\r\nGermany. If this were so, how could he know it? Such knowledge would\r\npresume powers of telepathy or vision beyond those given to man. I\r\ncould not believe that he possessed these; as Bickley said, it would be\r\npast experience. Yet it was most strange that he who was uninformed as\r\nto our national history and dangers, should have hit upon a country\r\nwith which we might well have been plunged into sudden struggle. Here\r\nagain I was bewildered and overcome. My brain rocked. I would seek\r\nsleep, and in it escape, or at any rate rest from all these mysteries.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we despatched Bastin to keep his rendezvous in\r\nthe sepulchre at the proper time. Had we not done so I felt sure that\r\nhe would have forgotten it, for on this occasion he was for once an\r\nunwilling missioner. He tried to persuade one of us to come with\r\nhim—even Bickley would have been welcome; but we both declared that we\r\ncould not dream of interfering in such a professional matter; also that\r\nour presence was forbidden, and would certainly distract the attention\r\nof his pupil.\r\n\r\n“What you mean,” said the gloomy Bastin, “is that you intend to enjoy\r\nyourselves up here in the female companionship of the Glittering Lady\r\nwhilst I sit thousands of feet underground attempting to lighten the\r\ndarkness of a violent old sinner whom I suspect of being in league with\r\nSatan.”\r\n\r\n“With whom you should be proud to break a lance,” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“So I am, in the daylight. For instance, when he uses _your_ mouth to\r\nadvance his arguments, Bickley, but this is another matter. However, if\r\nI do not appear again you will know that I died in a good cause, and, I\r\nhope, try to recover my remains and give them decent burial. Also, you\r\nmight inform the Bishop of how I came to my end, that is, if you ever\r\nget an opportunity, which is more than doubtful.”\r\n\r\n“Hurry up, Bastin, hurry up!” said the unfeeling Bickley, “or you will\r\nbe late for your appointment and put your would-be neophyte into a bad\r\ntemper.”\r\n\r\nThen Bastin went, carrying under his arm a large Bible printed in the\r\nlanguage of the South Sea Islands.\r\n\r\nA little while later Yva appeared, arrayed in her wondrous robes which,\r\nbeing a man, it is quite impossible for me to describe. She saw us\r\nlooking at these, and, after greeting us both, also Tommy, who was\r\nenraptured at her coming, asked us how the ladies of our country\r\nattired themselves.\r\n\r\nWe tried to explain, with no striking success.\r\n\r\n“You are as stupid about such matters as were the men of the Old\r\nWorld,” she said, shaking her head and laughing. “I thought that you\r\nhad with you pictures of ladies you have known which would show me.”\r\n\r\nNow, in fact, I had in a pocket-book a photograph of my wife in\r\nevening-dress, also a miniature of her head and bust painted on ivory,\r\na beautiful piece of work done by a master hand, which I always wore.\r\nThese, after a moment’s hesitation, I produced and showed to her,\r\nBickley having gone away for a little while to see about something\r\nconnected with his attempted analysis of the Life-water. She examined\r\nthem with great eagerness, and as she did so I noted that her face grew\r\ntender and troubled.\r\n\r\n“This was your wife,” she said as one who states what she knows to be a\r\nfact. I nodded, and she went on:\r\n\r\n“She was sweet and beautiful as a flower, but not so tall as I am, I\r\nthink.”\r\n\r\n“No,” I answered, “she lacked height; given that she would have been a\r\nlovely woman.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad you think that women should be tall,” she said, glancing at\r\nher shadow. “The eyes were such as mine, were they not—in colour, I\r\nmean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, very like yours, only yours are larger.”\r\n\r\n“That is a beautiful way of wearing the hair. Would you be angry if I\r\ntried it? I weary of this old fashion.”\r\n\r\n“Why should I be angry?” I asked.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Bickley reappeared and she began to talk of the details\r\nof the dress, saying that it showed more of the neck than had been the\r\ncustom among the women of her people, but was very pretty.\r\n\r\n“That is because we are still barbarians,” said Bickley; “at least, our\r\nwomen are, and therefore rely upon primitive methods of attraction,\r\nlike the savages yonder.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and, after a last, long glance, gave me back the photograph\r\nand the miniature, saying as she delivered the latter:\r\n\r\n“I rejoice to see that you are faithful, Humphrey, and wear this\r\npicture on your heart, as well as in it.”\r\n\r\n“Then you must be a very remarkable woman,” said Bickley. “Never before\r\ndid I hear one of your sex rejoice because a man was faithful to\r\nsomebody else.”\r\n\r\n“Has Bickley been disappointed in his love-heart, that he is so angry\r\nto us women?” asked Yva innocently of me. Then, without waiting for an\r\nanswer, she inquired of him whether he had been successful in his\r\nanalysis of the Life-water.\r\n\r\n“How do you know what I was doing with the Life-water? Did Bastin tell\r\nyou?” exclaimed Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Bastin told me nothing, except that he was afraid of the descent to\r\nNyo; that he hated Nyo when he reached it, as indeed I do, and that he\r\nthought that my father, the Lord Oro, was a devil or evil spirit from\r\nsome Under-world which he called hell.”\r\n\r\n“Bastin has an open heart and an open mouth,” said Bickley, “for which\r\nI respect him. Follow his example if you will, Lady Yva, and tell us\r\nwho and what is the Lord Oro, and who and what are you.”\r\n\r\n“Have we not done so already? If not, I will repeat. The Lord Oro and I\r\nare two who have lived on from the old time when the world was\r\ndifferent, and yet, I think, the same. He is a man and not a god, and I\r\nam a woman. His powers are great because of his knowledge, which he has\r\ngathered from his forefathers and in a life of a thousand years before\r\nhe went to sleep. He can do things you cannot do. Thus, he can pass\r\nthrough space and take others with him, and return again. He can learn\r\nwhat is happening in far-off parts of the world, as he did when he told\r\nyou of the war in which your country is concerned. He has terrible\r\npowers; for instance, he can kill, as he killed those savages. Also, he\r\nknows the secrets of the earth, and, if it pleases him, can change its\r\nturning so that earthquakes happen and sea becomes land, and land sea,\r\nand the places that were hot grow cold, and those that were cold grow\r\nhot.”\r\n\r\n“All of which things have happened many times in the history of the\r\nglobe,” said Bickley, “without the help of the Lord Oro.”\r\n\r\n“Others had knowledge before my father, and others doubtless will have\r\nknowledge after him. Even I, Yva, have some knowledge, and knowledge is\r\nstrength.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I interposed, “but such powers as you attribute to your father\r\nare not given to man.”\r\n\r\n“You mean to man as you know him, man like Bickley, who thinks that he\r\nhas learned everything that was ever learned. But it is not so.\r\nHundreds of thousands of years ago men knew more than it seems they do\r\ntoday, ten times more, as they lived ten times longer, or so you tell\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Men?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, men, not gods or spirits, as the uninstructed nations supposed\r\nthem to be. My father is a man subject to the hopes and terrors of man.\r\nHe desires power which is ambition, and when the world refused his\r\nrule, he destroyed that part of it which rebelled, which is revenge.\r\nMoreover, above all things he dreads death, which is fear. That is why\r\nhe suspended life in himself and me for two hundred and fifty thousand\r\nyears, as his knowledge gave him strength to do, because death was near\r\nand he thought that sleep was better than death.”\r\n\r\n“Why should he dread to die,” asked Bickley, “seeing that sleep and\r\ndeath are the same?”\r\n\r\n“Because his knowledge tells him that Sleep and Death are _not_ the\r\nsame, as you, in your foolishness, believe, for there Bastin is wiser\r\nthan you. Because for all his wisdom he remains ignorant of what\r\nhappens to man when the Light of Life is blown out by the breath of\r\nFate. That is why he fears to die and why he talks with Bastin the\r\nPreacher, who says he has the secret of the future.”\r\n\r\n“And do you fear to die?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No, Humphrey,” she answered gently. “Because I think that there is no\r\ndeath, and, having done no wrong, I dread no evil. I had dreams while I\r\nwas asleep, O Humphrey, and it seemed to me that—”\r\n\r\nHere she ceased and glanced at where she knew the miniature was hanging\r\nupon my breast.\r\n\r\n“Now,” she continued, after a little pause, “tell me of your world, of\r\nits history, of its languages, of what happens there, for I long to\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nSo then and there, assisted by Bickley, I began the education of the\r\nLady Yva. I do not suppose that there was ever a more apt pupil in the\r\nwhole earth. To begin with, she was better acquainted with every\r\nsubject on which I touched than I was myself; all she lacked was\r\ninformation as to its modern aspect. Her knowledge ended two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand years ago, at which date, however, it would seem\r\nthat civilisation had already touched a higher water-mark than it has\r\never since attained. Thus, this vanished people understood astronomy,\r\nnatural magnetism, the force of gravity, steam, also electricity to\r\nsome subtle use of which, I gathered, the lighting of their underground\r\ncity was to be attributed. They had mastered architecture and the arts,\r\nas their buildings and statues showed; they could fly through the air\r\nbetter than we have learned to do within the last few years.\r\n\r\nMore, they, or some of them, had learned the use of the Fourth\r\nDimension, that is their most instructed individuals, could move\r\n_through_ opposing things, as well as over them, up into them and\r\nacross them. This power these possessed in a two-fold form. I mean,\r\nthat they could either disintegrate their bodies at one spot and cause\r\nthem to integrate again at another, or they could project what the old\r\nEgyptians called the Ka or Double, and modern Theosophists name the\r\nAstral Shape, to any distance. Moreover, this Double, or Astral Shape,\r\nwhile itself invisible, still, so to speak, had the use of its senses.\r\nIt could see, it could hear, and it could remember, and, on returning\r\nto the body, it could avail itself of the experience thus acquired.\r\n\r\nThus, at least, said Yva, while Bickley contemplated her with a cold\r\nand unbelieving eye. She even went further and alleged that in certain\r\ninstances, individuals of her extinct race had been able to pass\r\nthrough the ether and to visit other worlds in the depths of space.\r\n\r\n“Have you ever done that?” asked Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Once or twice I dreamed that I did,” she replied quietly.\r\n\r\n“We can all dream,” he answered.\r\n\r\nAs it was my lot to make acquaintance with this strange and uncanny\r\npower at a later date, I will say no more of it now.\r\n\r\nTelepathy, she declared, was also a developed gift among the Sons of\r\nWisdom; indeed, they seem to have used it as we use wireless messages.\r\nOnly, in their case, the sending and receiving stations were skilled\r\nand susceptible human beings who went on duty for so many hours at a\r\ntime. Thus intelligence was transmitted with accuracy and despatch.\r\nThose who had this faculty were, she said, also very apt at reading the\r\nminds of others and therefore not easy to deceive.\r\n\r\n“Is that how you know that I had been trying to analyse your\r\nLife-water?” asked Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered, with her unvarying smile. “At the moment I spoke\r\nthereof you were wondering whether my father would be angry if he knew\r\nthat you had taken the water in a little flask.” She studied him for a\r\nmoment, then added: “Now you are wondering, first, whether I did not\r\nsee you take the water from the fountain and guess the purpose, and,\r\nsecondly, whether perhaps Bastin did not tell me what you were doing\r\nwith it when we met in the sepulchre.”\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said the exasperated Bickley, “I admit that telepathy and\r\nthought-reading are possible to a certain limited extent. But supposing\r\nthat you possess those powers, as I think in English, and you do not\r\nknow English, how can you interpret what is passing in my mind?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you have been teaching me English all this while without\r\nknowing it, Bickley. In any case, it matters little, seeing that what I\r\nread is the thought, not the language with which it is clothed. The\r\nthought comes from your mind to mine—that is, if I wish it, which is\r\nnot often—and I interpret it in my own or other tongues.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear it is not often, Lady Yva, since thoughts are\r\ngenerally considered private.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and therefore I will read yours no more. Why should I, when they\r\nare so full of disbelief of all I tell you, and sometimes of other\r\nthings about myself which I do not seek to know?”\r\n\r\n“No wonder that, according to the story in the pictures, those Nations,\r\nwhom you named Barbarians, made an end of your people, Lady Yva.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, Bickley; the Lord Oro made an end of the Nations,\r\nthough against my prayer,” she added with a sigh.\r\n\r\nThen Bickley departed in a rage, and did not appear again for an hour.\r\n\r\n“He is angry,” she said, looking after him; “nor do I wonder. It is\r\nhard for the very clever like Bickley, who think that they have\r\nmastered all things, to find that after all they are quite ignorant. I\r\nam sorry for him, and I like him very much.”\r\n\r\n“Then you would be sorry for me also, Lady Yva?”\r\n\r\n“Why?” she asked with a dazzling smile, “when your heart is athirst for\r\nknowledge, gaping for it like a fledgling’s mouth for food, and, as it\r\nchances, though I am not very wise, I can satisfy something of your\r\nsoul-hunger.”\r\n\r\n“Not very wise!” I repeated.\r\n\r\n“No, Humphrey. I think that Bastin, who in many ways is so stupid, has\r\nmore true wisdom than I have, because he can believe and accept without\r\nquestion. After all, the wisdom of my people is all of the universe and\r\nits wonders. What you think magic is not magic; it is only gathered\r\nknowledge and the finding out of secrets. Bickley will tell you the\r\nsame, although as yet he does not believe that the mind of man can\r\nstretch so far.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that your wisdom has in it nothing of the spirit?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Humphrey, that is what I mean. I do not even know if there is\r\nsuch a thing as spirit. Our god was Fate; Bastin’s god is a spirit, and\r\nI think yours also.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Therefore, I wish you and Bastin to teach me of your god, as does Oro,\r\nmy father. I want—oh! so much, Humphrey, to learn whether we live after\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\n“You!” I exclaimed. “You who, according to the story, have slept for\r\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand years! You, who have, unless I mistake,\r\nhinted that during that sleep you may have lived in other shapes! Do\r\nyou doubt whether we can live after death?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Sleep induced by secret arts is not death, and during that sleep\r\nthe _I_ within might wander and inhabit other shapes, because it is\r\nforbidden to be idle. Moreover, what seems to be death may not be\r\ndeath, only another form of sleep from which the _I_ awakes again upon\r\nthe world. But at last comes the real death, when the _I_ is\r\nextinguished to the world. That much I know, because my people learned\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“You mean, you know that men and women may live again and again upon\r\nthe world?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Humphrey, I do. For in the world there is only a certain store of\r\nlife which in many forms travels on and on, till the lot of each _I_ is\r\nfulfilled. Then comes the real death, and after that—what, oh!—what?”\r\n\r\n“You must ask Bastin,” I said humbly. “I cannot dare to teach of such\r\nmatters.”\r\n\r\n“No, but you can and do believe, and that helps me, Humphrey, who am in\r\ntune with you. Yes, it helps me much more than do Bastin and his new\r\nreligion, because such is woman’s way. Now, I think Bickley will soon\r\nreturn, so let us talk of other matters. Tell me of the history of your\r\npeople, Humphrey, that my father says are now at war.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nThe Accident\r\n\r\n\r\nBickley did return, having recovered his temper, since after all it was\r\nimpossible for anyone to remain angry with the Lady Yva for long, and\r\nwe spent a very happy time together. We instructed and she was the\r\nhumble pupil.\r\n\r\nHow swift and nimble was her intelligence! In that one morning she\r\nlearned all our alphabet and how to write our letters. It appeared that\r\namong her people, at any rate in their later periods, the only form of\r\nwriting that was used was a highly concentrated shorthand which saved\r\nlabour. They had no journals, since news which arrived telepathically\r\nor by some form of wireless was proclaimed to those who cared to\r\nlisten, and on it all formed their own judgments. In the same way poems\r\nand even romances were repeated, as in Homer’s day or in the time of\r\nthe Norse _sagas_, by word of mouth. None of their secret knowledge was\r\nwritten down. Like the ritual of Freemasonry it was considered too\r\nsacred.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when men lived for hundreds of years this was not so\r\nnecessary, especially as their great fear was lest it should fall into\r\nthe hands of the outside nations, whom they called Barbarians. For, be\r\nit remembered, these Sons of Wisdom were always a very small people who\r\nruled by the weight of their intelligence and the strength of their\r\naccumulated lore. Indeed, they could scarcely be called a people;\r\nrather were they a few families, all of them more or less connected\r\nwith the original ruling Dynasty which considered itself half divine.\r\nThese families were waited upon by a multitude of servants or slaves\r\ndrawn from the subject nations, for the most part skilled in one art or\r\nanother, or perhaps, remarkable for their personal beauty. Still they\r\nremained outside the pale.\r\n\r\nThe Sons of Wisdom did not intermarry with them or teach them their\r\nlearning, or even allow them to drink of their Life-water. They ruled\r\nthem as men rule dogs, treating them with kindness, but no more, and as\r\nmany dogs run their course and die in the lifetime of one master, so\r\ndid many of these slaves in that of one of the Sons of Wisdom.\r\nTherefore, the slaves came to regard their lords not as men, but gods.\r\nThey lived but three score years and ten like the rest of us, and went\r\ntheir way, they, whose great-great-grandfathers had served the same\r\nmaster and whose great-great-great-grandchildren would still serve him.\r\nWhat should we think of a lord who we knew was already adult in the\r\ntime of William the Conqueror, and who remained still vigorous and\r\nall-powerful in that of George V? One, moreover, who commanded almost\r\ninfinite knowledge to which we were denied the key? We might tremble\r\nbefore him and look upon him as half-divine, but should we not long to\r\nkill him and possess his knowledge and thereby prolong our own\r\nexistence to his wondrous measure?\r\n\r\nSuch, said Yva, was the case with their slaves and the peoples from\r\nwhence these sprang. They grew mad with jealous hate, till at length\r\ncame the end we knew.\r\n\r\nThus we talked on for hours till the time came for us to eat. As before\r\nYva partook of fruit and we of such meats as we had at hand. These, we\r\nnoticed, disgusted her, because, as she explained, the Children of\r\nWisdom, unless driven thereto by necessity, touched no flesh, but lived\r\non the fruits of the earth and wine alone. Only the slaves and the\r\nBarbarians ate flesh. In these views Bickley for once agreed with her,\r\nthat is, except as regards the wine, for in theory, if not in\r\npractice—he was a vegetarian.\r\n\r\n“I will bring you more of the Life-water,” she said, “and then you will\r\ngrow to hate these dead things, as I do. And now farewell. My father\r\ncalls me. I hear him though you do not. To-morrow I cannot come, but\r\nthe day after I will come and bring you the Life-water. Nay, accompany\r\nme not, but as I see he wishes it, let Tommy go with me. I will care\r\nfor him, and he is a friend in all that lonely place.”\r\n\r\nSo she went, and with her Tommy, rejoicing.\r\n\r\n“Ungrateful little devil!” said Bickley. “Here we’ve fed and petted him\r\nfrom puppyhood, or at least you have, and yet he skips off with the\r\nfirst stranger. I never saw him behave like that to any woman, except\r\nyour poor wife.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” I answered. “I cannot understand it. Hullo! here comes\r\nBastin.”\r\n\r\nBastin it was, dishevelled and looking much the worse for wear, also\r\nminus his Bible in the native tongue.\r\n\r\n“Well, how have you been getting on?” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“I should like some tea, also anything there is to eat.”\r\n\r\nWe supplied him with these necessaries, and after a while he said\r\nslowly and solemnly:\r\n\r\n“I cannot help thinking of a childish story which Bickley told or\r\ninvented one night at your house at home. I remember he had an argument\r\nwith my wife, which he said put him in mind of it, I am sure I don’t\r\nknow why. It was about a monkey and a parrot that were left together\r\nunder a sofa for a long while, where they were so quiet that everybody\r\nforgot them. Then the parrot came out with only one feather left in its\r\ntail and none at all on its body, saying, ‘I’ve had no end of a time!’\r\nafter which it dropped down and died. Do you know, I feel just like\r\nthat parrot, only I don’t mean to die, and I think I gave the monkey\r\nquite as good as he gave me!”\r\n\r\n“What happened?” I asked, intensely interested.\r\n\r\n“Oh! the Glittering Lady took me into that palace hall where Oro was\r\nsitting like a spider in a web, and left me there. I got to work at\r\nonce. He was much interested in the Old Testament stories and said\r\nthere were points of truth about them, although they had evidently come\r\ndown to the modern writer—he called him a _modern_ writer—in a\r\nlegendary form. I thought his remarks impertinent and with difficulty\r\nrefrained from saying so. Leaving the story of the Deluge and all that,\r\nI spoke of other matters, telling him of eternal life and Heaven and\r\nHell, of which the poor benighted man had never heard. I pointed out\r\nespecially that unless he repented, his life, by all accounts, had been\r\nso wicked, that he was certainly destined to the latter place.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say to that?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, I think it frightened him, if one could imagine Oro being\r\nfrightened. At any rate he remarked that the truth or falsity of what I\r\nsaid was an urgent matter for him, as he could not expect to live more\r\nthan a few hundred years longer, though perhaps he might prolong the\r\nperiod by another spell of sleep. Then he asked me why I thought him so\r\nwicked. I replied because he himself said that he had drowned millions\r\nof people, which showed an evil heart and intention even if it were not\r\na fact. He thought a long while and asked what could be done in the\r\ncircumstances. I replied that repentance and reparation were the only\r\ncourses open to him.”\r\n\r\n“Reparation!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, reparation was what I said, though I think I made a mistake\r\nthere, as you will see. As nearly as I can remember, he answered that\r\nhe was beginning to repent, as from all he had learned from us, he\r\ngathered that the races which had arisen as a consequence of his\r\naction, were worse than those which he had destroyed. As regards\r\nreparation, what he had done once he could do again. He would think the\r\nmatter over seriously, and see if it were possible and advisable to\r\nraise those parts of the world which had been sunk, and sink those\r\nwhich had been raised. If so, he thought that would make very handsome\r\namends to the departed nations and set him quite right with any\r\nsuperior Power, if such a thing existed. What are you laughing at,\r\nBickley? I don’t think it a laughing matter, since such remarks do not\r\nseem to me to indicate any real change in Oro’s heart, which is what I\r\nwas trying to effect.”\r\n\r\nBickley, who was convulsed with merriment, wiped his eyes and said:\r\n\r\n“You dear old donkey, don’t you see what you have done, or rather would\r\nhave done if there were a word of truth in all this ridiculous story\r\nabout a deluge? You would be in the way of making your precious pupil,\r\nwho certainly is the most masterly old liar in the world, repeat his\r\noffence and send Europe to the bottom of the sea.”\r\n\r\n“That did occur to me, but it doesn’t much matter as I am quite certain\r\nthat such a thing would never be allowed. Of course there was a real\r\ndeluge once, but Oro had no more to do with it than I had. Don’t you\r\nagree, Arbuthnot?”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” I answered cautiously, “but really in this place I am\r\nbeginning to lose count of what is or is not possible. Also, of course,\r\nthere may have been many deluges; indeed the history of the world shows\r\nthat this was so; it is written in its geological strata. What was the\r\nend of it?”\r\n\r\n“The end was that he took the South Sea Bible and, after I had\r\nexplained a little about our letters, seemed to be able to read it at\r\nonce. I suppose he was acquainted with the art of printing in his\r\nyouth. At any rate he said that he would study it, I don’t know how,\r\nunless he can read, and that in two days’ time he would let me know\r\nwhat he thought about the matter of my religion. Then he told me to go.\r\nI said that I did not know the way and was afraid of losing myself.\r\nThereupon he waved his hand, and I really can’t say what happened.”\r\n\r\n“Did you levitate up here,” asked Bickley, “like the late lamented Mr.\r\nHome at the spiritualistic seances?”\r\n\r\n“No, I did not exactly levitate, but something or someone seemed to get\r\na hold of me, and I was just rushed along in a most tumultuous fashion.\r\nThe next thing I knew was that I was standing at the door of that\r\nsepulchre, though I have no recollection of going up in the lift, or\r\nwhatever it is. I believe those beastly caves are full of ghosts, or\r\ndevils, and the worst of it is that they have kept my solar-tope, which\r\nI put on this morning forgetting that it would be useless there.”\r\n\r\n“The Lady Yva’s Fourth Dimension in action,” I suggested, “only it\r\nwouldn’t work on solar-topes.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you are talking about,” said Bastin, “but if my hat\r\nhad to be left, why not my boots and other garments? Please stop your\r\nnonsense and pass the tea. Thank goodness I haven’t got to go down\r\nthere tomorrow, as he seems to have had enough of me for the present,\r\nso I vote we all pay a visit to the ship. It will be a very pleasant\r\nchange. I couldn’t stand two days running with that old fiend, and his\r\nghosts or devils in the cave.”\r\n\r\nNext morning accordingly, fearing no harm from the Orofenans, we took\r\nthe canoe and rowed to the main island. Marama had evidently seen us\r\ncoming, for he and a number of his people met us with every\r\ndemonstration of delight, and escorted us to the ship. Here we found\r\nthings just as we had left them, for there had been no attempt at theft\r\nor other mischief.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in the cabin a fit of moral weakness seemed to overcome\r\nBickley, the first and I may add the last from which I ever saw him\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” he said, addressing us, “I think that we should do well\r\nto try to get out of this place. Eliminating a great deal of the\r\nmarvelous with which we seem to have come in touch here, it is still\r\nobvious that we find ourselves in very peculiar and unhealthy\r\nsurroundings. I mean mentally unhealthy, indeed I think that if we stay\r\nhere much longer we shall probably go off our heads. Now that boat on\r\nthe deck remains sound and seaworthy. Why should not we provision her\r\nand take our chance? We know more or less which way to steer.”\r\n\r\nBastin and I looked at each other. It was he who spoke first.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t it be rather a risky job in an open boat?” he asked.\r\n“However, that doesn’t matter much because I don’t take any account of\r\nrisks, knowing that I am of more value than a sparrow and that the\r\nhairs of my head are all numbered.”\r\n\r\n“They might be numbered under water as well as above it,” muttered\r\nBickley, “and I feel sure that on your own showing, you would be as\r\nvaluable dead as alive.”\r\n\r\n“What I seem to feel,” went on Bastin, “is that I have work to my hand\r\nhere. Also, the _locum tenens_ at Fulcombe no doubt runs the parish as\r\nwell as I could. Indeed I consider him a better man for the place than\r\nI am. That old Oro is a tough proposition, but I do not despair of him\r\nyet, and besides him there is the Glittering Lady, a most open-minded\r\nperson, whom I have not yet had any real opportunity of approaching in\r\na spiritual sense. Then there are all these natives who cannot learn\r\nwithout a teacher. So on the whole I think I would rather stay where I\r\nam until Providence points out some other path.”\r\n\r\n“I am of the same opinion, if for somewhat different reasons,” I said.\r\n“I do not suppose that it has often been the fortune of men to come in\r\ntouch with such things as we have found upon this island. They may be\r\nillusions, but at least they are very interesting illusions. One might\r\nlive ten lifetimes and find nothing else of the sort. Therefore I\r\nshould like to see the end of the dream.”\r\n\r\nBickley reflected a little, then said:\r\n\r\n“On the whole I agree with you. Only my brain totters and I am terribly\r\nafraid of madness. I cannot believe what I seem to hear and see, and\r\nthat way madness lies. It is better to die than to go mad.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll do that anyway when your time comes, Bickley, I mean decease,\r\nof course,” interrupted Bastin. “And who knows, perhaps all this is an\r\nopportunity given by Providence to open your eyes, which, I must say,\r\nare singularly blind. You think you know everything there is to learn,\r\nbut the fact is that like the rest of us, you know nothing at all, and\r\ngood man though you are, obstinately refuse to admit the truth and to\r\nseek support elsewhere. For my part I believe that you are afraid of\r\nfalling in love with that Glittering Lady and of being convinced by her\r\nthat you are wrong in your most unsatisfactory conclusions.”\r\n\r\n“I am out-voted anyway,” said Bickley, “and for the rest, Bastin, look\r\nafter yourself and leave me alone. I will add that on the whole I think\r\nyou are both right, and that it is wisest for us to stop where we are,\r\nfor after all we can only die once.”\r\n\r\n“I am not so sure, Bickley. There is a thing called the second death,\r\nwhich is what is troubling that old scoundrel, Oro. Now I will go and\r\nlook for those books.”\r\n\r\nSo the idea of flight was abandoned, although I admit that even to\r\nmyself it had attractions. For I felt that I was being wrapped in a net\r\nof mysteries from which I saw no escape. Yes, and of more than\r\nmysteries; I who had sworn that I would never look upon another woman,\r\nwas learning to love this sweet and wondrous Yva, and of that what\r\ncould be the end?\r\n\r\nWe collected all we had come to seek, and started homewards escorted by\r\nMarama and his people, including a number of young women who danced\r\nbefore us in a light array of flowers.\r\n\r\nPassing our old house, we came to the grove where the idol Oro had\r\nstood and Bastin was so nearly sacrificed. There was another idol there\r\nnow which he wished to examine, but in the end did not as the natives\r\nso obviously objected. Indeed Marama told me that notwithstanding the\r\nmysterious death of the sorcerers on the Rock of Offerings, there was\r\nstill a strong party in the island who would be glad to do us a\r\nmischief if any further affront were offered to their hereditary god.\r\n\r\nHe questioned us also tentatively about the apparition, for such he\r\nconceived it to be, which had appeared upon the rock and killed the\r\nsorcerers, and I answered him as I thought wisest, telling him that a\r\nterrible Power was afoot in the land, which he would do well to obey.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said; “the God of the Mountain of whom the tradition has come\r\ndown to us from our forefathers. He is awake again; he sees, he hears\r\nand we are afraid. Plead with him for us, O Friend-from-the-Sea.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke we were passing through a little patch of thick bush.\r\nSuddenly from out of this bush, I saw a lad appear. He wore a mask upon\r\nhis face, but from his shape could not have been more than thirteen or\r\nfourteen years of age. In his hand was a wooden club. He ran forward,\r\nstopped, and with a yell of hate hurled it, I think at Bastin, but it\r\nhit me. At any rate I felt a shock and remembered no more.\r\n\r\nDreams. Dreams. Endless dreams! What were they all about? I do not\r\nknow. It seemed to me that through them continually I saw the stately\r\nfigure of old Oro contemplating me gravely, as though he were making up\r\nhis mind about something in which I must play a part. Then there was\r\nanother figure, that of the gracious but imperial Yva, who from time to\r\ntime, as I thought, leant over me and whispered in my ear words of rest\r\nand comfort. Nor was this all, since her shape had a way of changing\r\nsuddenly into that of my lost wife who would speak with her voice. Or\r\nperhaps my wife would speak with Yva’s voice. To my disordered sense it\r\nwas as though they were one personality, having two shapes, either of\r\nwhich could be assumed at will. It was most strange and yet to me most\r\nblessed, since in the living I seemed to have found the dead, and in\r\nthe dead the living. More, I took journeys, or rather some unknown part\r\nof me seemed to do so. One of these I remember, for its majestic\r\ncharacter stamped itself upon my mind in such a fashion that all the\r\nwaters of delirium could not wash it out nor all its winds blow away\r\nthat memory.\r\n\r\nI was travelling through space with Yva a thousand times faster than\r\nlight can flash. We passed sun after sun. They drew near, they grew\r\ninto enormous, flaming Glories round which circled world upon world.\r\nThey became small, dwindled to points of light and disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe found footing upon some far land and passed a marvelous white city\r\nwherein were buildings with domes of crystal and alabaster, in the\r\nlatter of which were set windows made of great jewels; sapphires or\r\nrubies they seemed to me. We went on up a lovely valley. To the left\r\nwere hills, down which tumbled waterfalls; to the right was a river\r\nbroad and deep that seemed to overflow its banks as does the Nile.\r\nBehind were high mountains on the slopes of which grew forests of\r\nglorious trees, some of them aflame with bloom, while far away up their\r\ncrests stood colossal golden statues set wide apart. They looked like\r\nguardian angels watching that city and that vale. The land was lit with\r\na light such as that of the moon, only intensified and of many colours.\r\nIndeed looking up, I saw that above us floated three moons, each of\r\nthem bigger than our own at the full, and gathered that here it was\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWe came to a house set amid scented gardens and having in front of it\r\nterraces of flowers. It seemed not unlike my own house at home, but I\r\ntook little note of it, because of a woman who sat upon the verandah,\r\nif I may call it so. She was clad in garments of white silk fastened\r\nabout her middle with a jewelled girdle. On her neck also was a collar\r\nof jewels. I forget the colour; indeed this seemed to change\r\ncontinually as the light from the different moons struck when she\r\nmoved, but I think its prevailing tinge was blue. In her arms this\r\nwoman nursed a beauteous, sleeping child, singing happily as she rocked\r\nit to and fro. Yva went towards the woman who looked up at her step and\r\nuttered a little cry. Then for the first time I saw the woman’s face.\r\nIt was that of my dead wife!\r\n\r\nAs I followed in my dream, a little cloud of mist seemed to cover both\r\nmy wife and Yva, and when I reached the place Yva was gone. Only my\r\nwife remained, she and the child. There she stood, solemn and sweet.\r\nWhile I drew near she laid down the child upon the cushioned seat from\r\nwhich she had risen. She stretched out her arms and flung them about\r\nme. She embraced me and I embraced her in a rapture of reunion. Then\r\nturning she lifted up the child, it was a girl, for me to kiss.\r\n\r\n“See your daughter,” she said, “and behold all that I am making ready\r\nfor you where we shall dwell in a day to come.”\r\n\r\nI grew confused.\r\n\r\n“Yva,” I said. “Where is Yva who brought me here? Did she go into the\r\nhouse?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered happily. “Yva went into the house. Look again!”\r\n\r\nI looked and it was Yva’s face that was pressed against my own, and\r\nYva’s eyes that gazed into mine. Only she was garbed as my wife had\r\nbeen, and on her bosom hung the changeful necklace.\r\n\r\n“You may not stay,” she whispered, and lo! it was my wife that spoke,\r\nnot Yva.\r\n\r\n“Tell me what it means?” I implored.\r\n\r\n“I cannot,” she answered. “There are mysteries that you may not know as\r\nyet. Love Yva if you will and I shall not be jealous, for in loving Yva\r\nyou love me. You cannot understand? Then know this, that the spirit has\r\nmany shapes, and yet is the same spirit—sometimes. Now I who am far,\r\nyet near, bid you farewell a while.”\r\n\r\nThen all passed in a flash and the dream ended.\r\n\r\nSuch was the only one of those visions which I can recall.\r\n\r\nI seemed to wake up as from a long and tumultuous sleep. The first\r\nthing I saw was the palm roof of our house upon the rock. I knew it was\r\nour house, for just above me was a palm leaf of which I had myself tied\r\nthe stalk to the framework with a bit of coloured ribbon that I had\r\nchanced to find in my pocket. It came originally from the programme\r\ncard of a dance that I had attended at Honolulu and I had kept it\r\nbecause I thought it might be useful. Finally I used it to secure that\r\nloose leaf. I stared at the ribbon which brought back a flood of\r\nmemories, and as I was thus engaged I heard voices talking, and\r\nlistened—Bickley’s voice, and the Lady Yva’s.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Bickley was saying, “he will do well now, but he went near, very\r\nnear.”\r\n\r\n“I knew he would not die,” she answered, “because my father said so.”\r\n\r\n“There are two sorts of deaths,” replied Bickley, “that of the body and\r\nthat of the mind. I was afraid that even if he lived, his reason would\r\ngo, but from certain indications I do not think that will happen now.\r\nHe will get quite well again—though—” and he stopped.\r\n\r\n“I am very glad to hear you say so,” chimed in Bastin. “For weeks I\r\nthought that I should have to read the Burial Service over poor\r\nArbuthnot. Indeed I was much puzzled as to the best place to bury him.\r\nFinally I found a very suitable spot round the corner there, where it\r\nisn’t rock, in which one can’t dig and the soil is not liable to be\r\nflooded. In fact I went so far as to clear away the bush and to mark\r\nout the grave with its foot to the east. In this climate one can’t\r\ndelay, you know.”\r\n\r\nWeak as I was, I smiled. This practical proceeding was so exactly like\r\nBastin.\r\n\r\n“Well, you wasted your labour,” exclaimed Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am glad to say I did. But I don’t think it was your operations\r\nand the rest that cured him, Bickley, although you take all the credit.\r\nI believe it was the Life-water that the Lady Yva made him drink and\r\nthe stuff that Oro sent which we gave him when you weren’t looking.”\r\n\r\n“Then I hope that in the future you will not interfere with my cases,”\r\nsaid the indignant Bickley, and either the voices passed away or I went\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen I woke up again it was to find the Lady Yva seated at my side\r\nwatching me.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, Humphrey, because I here; others gone out walking,” she\r\nsaid slowly in English.\r\n\r\n“Who taught you my language?” I asked, astonished.\r\n\r\n“Bastin and Bickley, while you ill, they teach; they teach me much. Man\r\njust same now as he was hundred thousand years ago,” she added\r\nenigmatically. “All think one woman beautiful when no other woman\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” I replied, wondering to what proceedings on the part of\r\nBastin and Bickley she alluded. Could that self-centred pair—oh! it was\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n“How long have I been ill?” I asked to escape the subject which I felt\r\nto be uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nShe lifted her beautiful eyes in search of words and began to count\r\nupon her fingers.\r\n\r\n“Two moon, one half moon, yes, ten week, counting Sabbath,” she\r\nanswered triumphantly.\r\n\r\n“Ten weeks!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Humphrey, ten whole weeks and three days you first bad, then mad.\r\nOh!” she went on, breaking into the Orofenan tongue which she spoke so\r\nperfectly, although it was not her own. That language of hers I never\r\nlearned, but I know she thought in it and only translated into\r\nOrofenan, because of the great difficulty which she had in rendering\r\nher high and refined ideas into its simpler metaphor, and the strange\r\nwords which often she introduced. “Oh! you have been very ill, friend\r\nof my heart. At times I thought that you were going to die, and wept\r\nand wept. Bickley thinks that he saved you and he is very clever. But\r\nhe could not have saved you; that wanted more knowledge than any of\r\nyour people have; only I pray you, do not tell him so because it would\r\nhurt his pride.”\r\n\r\n“What was the matter with me then, Yva?”\r\n\r\n“All was the matter. First, the weapon which that youth threw—he was\r\nthe son of the sorcerer whom my father destroyed—crushed in the bone of\r\nyour head. He is dead for his crime and may he be accursed for ever,”\r\nshe added in the only outbreak of rage and vindictiveness in which I\r\never saw her indulge.\r\n\r\n“One must make excuses for him; his father had been killed,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is what Bastin tells me, and it is true. Still, for that\r\nyoung man I can make no excuse; it was cowardly and wicked. Well,\r\nBickley performed what he calls operation, and the Lord Oro, he came up\r\nfrom his house and helped him, because Bastin is no good in such\r\nthings. Then he can only turn away his head and pray. I, too, helped,\r\nholding hot water and linen and jar of the stuff that made you feel\r\nlike nothing, although the sight made me feel more sick than anything\r\nsince I saw one I loved killed, oh, long, long ago.”\r\n\r\n“Was the operation successful?” I asked, for I did not dare to begin to\r\nthank her.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that clever man, Bickley, lifted the bone which had been crushed\r\nin. Only then something broke in your head and you began to bleed\r\nhere,” and she touched what I believe is called the temporal artery.\r\n“The vein had been crushed by the blow, and gave way. Bickley worked\r\nand worked, and just in time he tied it up before you died. Oh! then I\r\nfelt as though I loved Bickley, though afterwards Bastin said that I\r\nought to have loved _him_, since it was not Bickley who stopped the\r\nbleeding, but his prayer.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it was both,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, Humphrey, at least you were saved. Then came another trouble.\r\nYou took fever. Bickley said that it was because a certain gnat had\r\nbitten you when you went down to the ship, and my father, the Lord Oro,\r\ntold me that this was right. At the least you grew very weak and lost\r\nyour mind, and it seemed as though you must die. Then, Humphrey, I went\r\nto the Lord Oro and kneeled before him and prayed for your life, for I\r\nknew that he could cure you if he would, though Bickley’s skill was at\r\nan end.\r\n\r\n“‘Daughter,’ he said to me, ‘not once but again and again you have set\r\nup your will against mine in the past. Why then should I trouble myself\r\nto grant this desire of yours in the present, and save a man who is\r\nnothing to me?’\r\n\r\n“I rose to my feet and answered, ‘I do not know, my Father, yet I am\r\ncertain that for your own sake it will be well to do so. I am sure that\r\nof everything even you must give an account at last, great though you\r\nbe, and who knows, perhaps one life which you have saved may turn the\r\nbalance in your favour.’\r\n\r\n“‘Surely the priest Bastin has been talking to you,’ he said.\r\n\r\n“‘He has,’ I answered, ‘and not he alone. Many voices have been talking\r\nto me.’”\r\n\r\n“What did you mean by that?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It matters nothing what I meant, Humphrey. Be still and listen to my\r\nstory. My father thought a while and answered:\r\n\r\n“‘I am jealous of this stranger. What is he but a short-lived\r\nhalf-barbarian such as we knew in the old days? And yet already you\r\nthink more of him than you do of me, your father, the divine Oro who\r\nhas lived a thousand years. At first I helped that physician to save\r\nhim, but now I think I wish him dead.’\r\n\r\n“‘If you let this man die, my Father,’ I answered, ‘then we part.\r\nRemember that I also have of the wisdom of our people, and can use it\r\nif I will.’\r\n\r\n“‘Then save him yourself,’ he said.\r\n\r\n“‘Perhaps I shall, my Father,’ I answered, ‘but if so it will not be\r\nhere. I say that if so we part and you shall be left to rule in your\r\nmajesty alone.’\r\n\r\n“Now this frightened the Lord Oro, for he has the weakness that he\r\nhates to be alone.\r\n\r\n“‘If I do what you will, do you swear never to leave me, Yva?’ he\r\nasked. ‘Know that if you will not swear, the man dies.’\r\n\r\n“‘I swear,’ I answered—for your sake, Humphrey—though I did not love\r\nthe oath.\r\n\r\n“Then he gave me a certain medicine to mix with the Life-water, and\r\nwhen you were almost gone that medicine cured you, though Bickley does\r\nnot know it, as nothing else could have done. Now I have told you the\r\ntruth, for your own ear only, Humphrey.”\r\n\r\n“Yva,” I asked, “why did you do all this for me?”\r\n\r\n“Humphrey, I do not know,” she answered, “but I think because I must.\r\nNow sleep a while.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nThe Proposals of Bastin and Bickley\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as my body was concerned I grew well with great rapidity, though\r\nit was long before I got back my strength. Thus I could not walk far or\r\nendure any sustained exertion. With my mind it was otherwise. I can not\r\nexplain what had happened to it; indeed I do not know, but in a sense\r\nit seemed to have become detached and to have assumed a kind of\r\npersonality of its own. At times it felt as though it were no longer an\r\ninhabitant of the body, but rather its more or less independent\r\npartner. I was perfectly clear-headed and of insanity I experienced no\r\nsymptoms. Yet my mind, I use that term from lack of a better, was not\r\nentirely under my control. For one thing, at night it appeared to\r\nwander far away, though whither it went and what it saw there I could\r\nnever remember.\r\n\r\nI record this because possibly it explains certain mysterious events,\r\nif they were events and not dreams, which shortly I must set out. I\r\nspoke to Bickley about the matter. He put it by lightly, saying that it\r\nwas only a result of my long and most severe illness and that I should\r\nsteady down in time, especially if we could escape from that island and\r\nits unnatural atmosphere. Yet as he spoke he glanced at me shrewdly\r\nwith his quick eyes, and when he turned to go away I heard him mutter\r\nsomething to himself about “unholy influences” and “that confounded old\r\nOro.”\r\n\r\nThe words were spoken to himself and quite beneath his breath, and of\r\ncourse not meant to reach me. But one of the curious concomitants of my\r\nstate was that all my senses, and especially my hearing, had become\r\nmost abnormally acute. A whisper far away was now to me like a loud\r\nremark made in a room.\r\n\r\nBickley’s reflection, for I can scarcely call it more, set me thinking.\r\nYva had said that Oro sent me medicine which was administered to me\r\nwithout Bickley’s knowledge, and as she believed, saved my life, or\r\ncertainly my reason. What was in it? I wondered. Then there was that\r\nLife-water which Yva brought and insisted upon my drinking every day.\r\nUndoubtedly it was a marvelous tonic and did me good. But it had other\r\neffects also. Thus, as she said would be the case, after a course of it\r\nI conceived the greatest dislike, which I may add has never entirely\r\nleft me, of any form of meat, also of alcohol. All I seemed to want was\r\nthis water with fruit, or such native vegetables as there were. Bickley\r\ndisapproved and made me eat fish occasionally, but even this revolted\r\nme, and since I gained steadily in weight, as we found out by a simple\r\ncontrivance, and remained healthy in every other way, soon he allowed\r\nme to choose my own diet.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Oro began to pay me frequent visits. He always came at\r\nnight, and what is more I knew when he was coming, although he never\r\ngave me warning. Here I should explain that during my illness Bastin,\r\nwho was so ingenious in such matters, had built another hut in which he\r\nand Bickley slept, of course when they were not watching me, leaving\r\nour old bed-chamber to myself.\r\n\r\nWell, I would wake up and be aware that Oro was coming. Then he\r\nappeared in a silent and mysterious way, as though he had materialised\r\nin the room, for I never saw him pass the doorway. In the moonlight, or\r\nthe starlight, which flowed through the entrance and the side of the\r\nhut that was only enclosed with latticework, I perceived him seat\r\nhimself upon a certain stool, looking like a most majestic ghost with\r\nhis flowing robes, long white beard, hooked nose and hawk eyes. In the\r\nday-time he much resembled the late General Booth whom I had often\r\nseen, except for certain added qualities of height and classic beauty\r\nof countenance. At night, however, he resembled no one but himself,\r\nindeed there was something mighty and godlike in his appearance,\r\nsomething that made one feel that he was not as are other men.\r\n\r\nFor a while he would sit and look at me. Then he began to speak in a\r\nlow, vibrant voice. What did he speak of? Well, many matters. It was as\r\nthough he were unburdening that hoary soul of his because it could no\r\nlonger endure the grandeur of its own loneliness. Amongst sundry secret\r\nthings, he told me of the past history of this world of ours, and of\r\nthe mighty civilisations which for uncounted ages he and his\r\nforefathers had ruled by the strength of their will and knowledge, of\r\nthe dwindling of their race and of the final destruction of its\r\nenemies, although I noticed that now he no longer said that this was\r\nhis work alone. One night I asked him if he did not miss all such pomp\r\nand power.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he broke out, and for the first time I really learned\r\nwhat ambition can be when it utterly possesses the soul of man.\r\n\r\n“Are you mad,” he asked, “that you suppose that I, Oro, the King of\r\nkings, can be content to dwell solitary in a great cave with none but\r\nthe shadows of the dead to serve me? Nay, I must rule again and be even\r\ngreater than before, or else I too will die. Better to face the future,\r\neven if it means oblivion, than to remain thus a relic of a glorious\r\npast, still living and yet dead, like that statue of the great god Fate\r\nwhich you saw in the temple of my worship.”\r\n\r\n“Bastin does not think that the future means oblivion,” I remarked.\r\n\r\n“I know it. I have studied his faith and find it too humble for my\r\ntaste, also too new. Shall I, Oro, creep a suppliant before any Power,\r\nand confess what Bastin is pleased to call my sins? Nay, I who am great\r\nwill be the equal of all greatness, or nothing.”\r\n\r\nHe paused a while, then went on:\r\n\r\n“Bastin speaks of ‘eternity.’ Where and what then is this eternity\r\nwhich if it has no end can have had no beginning? I know the secret of\r\nthe suns and their attendant worlds, and they are no more eternal than\r\nthe insect which glitters for an hour. Out of shapeless, rushing gases\r\nthey gathered to live their day, and into gases at last they dissolve\r\nagain with all they bore.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “but they reform into new worlds.”\r\n\r\n“That have no part with the old. This world, too, will melt, departing\r\nto whence it came, as your sacred writings say, and what then of those\r\nwho dwelt and dwell thereon? No, Man of today, give me Time in which I\r\nrule and keep your dreams of an Eternity that is not, and in which you\r\nmust still crawl and serve, even if it were. Yet, if I might, I confess\r\nit, I would live on for ever, but as Master not as Slave.”\r\n\r\nOn another night he began to tempt me, very subtly. “I see a spark of\r\ngreatness in you, Humphrey,” he said, “and it comes into my heart that\r\nyou, too, might learn to rule. With Yva, the last of my blood, it is\r\notherwise. She is the child of my age and of a race outworn; too\r\ngentle, too much all womanly. The soul that triumphs must shine like\r\nsteel in the sun, and cut if need be; not merely be beauteous and shed\r\nperfume like a lily in the shade. Yet she is very wise and fair,” here\r\nhe looked at me, “perchance of her might come children such as were\r\ntheir forefathers, who again would wield the sceptre of the dominion of\r\nthe earth.”\r\n\r\nI made no answer, wondering what he meant exactly and thinking it\r\nwisest to be silent.\r\n\r\n“You are of the short-lived races,” he went on, “yet very much a man,\r\nnot without intelligence, and by the arts I have I can so strengthen\r\nyour frame that it will endure the shocks of time for three such lives\r\nas yours, or perchance for more, and then—”\r\n\r\nAgain he paused and went on:\r\n\r\n“The Daughter of kings likes you also, perhaps because you resemble—”\r\nhere he fixed me with his piercing eyes, “a certain kinglet of base\r\nblood whom once she also liked, but whom it was my duty to destroy.\r\nWell, I must think. I must study this world of yours also and therein\r\nyou may help me. Perhaps afterwards I will tell you how. Now sleep.”\r\n\r\nIn another moment he was gone, but notwithstanding his powerful\r\ncommand, for a while I could not sleep. I understood that he was\r\noffering Yva to me, but upon what terms? That was the question. With\r\nher was to go great dominion over the kingdoms of the earth. I could\r\nnot help remembering that always this has been and still is Satan’s\r\nfavourite bait. To me it did not particularly appeal. I had been\r\nambitious in my time—who is not that is worth his salt? I could have\r\nwished to excel in something, literature or art, or whatever it might\r\nbe, and thus to ensure the memory of my name in the world.\r\n\r\nOf course this is a most futile desire, seeing that soon or late every\r\nname must fade out of the world like an unfixed photograph which is\r\nexposed to the sun. Even if it could endure, as the old demigod, or\r\ndemidevil, Oro, had pointed out, very shortly, by comparison with\r\nTime’s unmeasured vastness, the whole solar system will also fade. So\r\nof what use is this feeble love of fame and this vain attempt to be\r\nremembered that animates us so strongly? Moreover, the idea of enjoying\r\nmere temporal as opposed to intellectual power, appealed to me not at\r\nall. I am a student of history and I know what has been the lot of\r\nkings and the evil that, often enough, they work in their little day.\r\n\r\nAlso if I needed any further example, there was that of Oro himself. He\r\nhad outlived the greatness of his House, as a royal family is called,\r\nand after some gigantic murder, if his own story was to be believed,\r\nindulged in a prolonged sleep. Now he awoke to find himself quite alone\r\nin the world, save for a daughter with whom he did not agree or\r\nsympathise. In short, he was but a kind of animated mummy inspired by\r\none idea which I felt quite sure would be disappointed, namely, to\r\nrenew his former greatness. To me he seemed as miserable a figure as\r\none could imagine, brooding and plotting in his illuminated cave, at\r\nthe end of an extended but misspent life.\r\n\r\nAlso I wondered what he, or rather his _ego_, had been doing during all\r\nthose two hundred and fifty thousand years of sleep. Possibly if Yva’s\r\ntheory, as I understood it, were correct, he had reincarnated as\r\nAttila, or Tamerlane, or Napoleon, or even as Chaka the terrible Zulu\r\nking. At any rate there he was still in the world, filled with the\r\ndread of death, but consumed now as ever by his insatiable and most\r\nuseless finite ambitions.\r\n\r\nYva, also! Her case was his, but yet how different. In all this long\r\nnight of Time she had but ripened into one of the sweetest and most\r\ngentle women that ever the world bore. She, too, was great in her way,\r\nit appeared in her every word and gesture, but where was the ferocity\r\nof her father? Where his desire to reach to splendour by treading on a\r\nblood-stained road paved with broken human hearts? It did not exist.\r\nHer nature was different although her body came of a long line of these\r\npower-loving kings. Why this profound difference of the spirit? Like\r\neverything else it was a mystery. The two were as far apart as the\r\nPoles. Everyone must have hated Oro, from the beginning, however much\r\nhe feared him, but everyone who came in touch with her must have loved\r\nYva.\r\n\r\nHere I may break into my personal narrative to say that this, by their\r\nown confession, proved to be true of two such various persons as Bastin\r\nand Bickley.\r\n\r\n“The truth, which I am sure it would be wrong to hide from you,\r\nArbuthnot,” said the former to me one day, “is that during your long\r\nillness I fell in love, I suppose that is the right word, with the\r\nGlittering Lady. After thinking the matter over also, I conceived that\r\nit would be proper to tell her so if only to clear the air and prevent\r\nfuture misunderstandings. As I remarked to her on that occasion, I had\r\nhesitated long, as I was not certain how she would fill the place of\r\nthe wife of the incumbent of an English parish.”\r\n\r\n“Mothers’ Meetings, and the rest,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“Exactly so, Arbuthnot. Also there were the views of the Bishop to be\r\nconsidered, who might have objected to the introduction into the\r\ndiocese of a striking person who so recently had been a heathen, and to\r\none in such strong contrast to my late beloved wife.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you didn’t consider the late Mrs. Bastin’s views on the\r\nsubject of re-marriage. I remember that they were strong,” I remarked\r\nrather maliciously.\r\n\r\n“No, I did not think it necessary, since the Scriptural instructions on\r\nthe matter are very clear, and in another world no doubt all\r\njealousies, even Sarah’s, will be obliterated. Upon that point my\r\nconscience was quite easy. So when I found that, unlike her parent, the\r\nLady Yva was much inclined to accept the principles of the faith in\r\nwhich it is my privilege to instruct her, I thought it proper to say to\r\nher that if ultimately she made up her mind to do so—of course _this_\r\nwas a _sine qua non_—I should be much honoured, and as a man, not as a\r\npriest, it would make me most happy if she would take me as a husband.\r\nOf course I explained to her that I considered, under the\r\ncircumstances, I could quite lawfully perform the marriage ceremony\r\nmyself with you and Bickley as witnesses, even should Oro refuse to\r\ngive her away. Also I told her that although after her varied\r\nexperiences in the past, life at Fulcombe, if we could ever get there,\r\nmight be a little monotonous, still it would not be entirely devoid of\r\ninterest.”\r\n\r\n“You mean Christmas decorations and that sort of thing?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and choir treats and entertaining Deputations and attending other\r\nChurch activities.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and what did she say, Bastin?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! she was most kind and flattering. Indeed that hour will always\r\nremain the pleasantest of my life. I don’t know how it happened, but\r\nwhen it was over I felt quite delighted that she had refused me. Indeed\r\non second thoughts, I am not certain but that I shall be much happier\r\nin the capacities of a brother and teacher which she asked me to fill,\r\nthan I should have been as her husband. To tell you the truth,\r\nArbuthnot, there are moments when I am not sure whether I entirely\r\nunderstand the Lady Yva. It was rather like proposing to one’s guardian\r\nangel.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, “that’s about it, old fellow. ‘Guardian Angel’ is not a\r\nbad name for her.”\r\n\r\nAfterwards I received the confidence of Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Arbuthnot,” he said. “I want to own up to something. I\r\nthink I ought to, because of certain things I have observed, in order\r\nto prevent possible future misunderstandings.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that?” I asked innocently.\r\n\r\n“Only this. As you know, I have always been a confirmed bachelor on\r\nprinciple. Women introduce too many complications into life, and\r\nalthough it involves some sacrifice, on the whole, I have thought it\r\nbest to do without them and leave the carrying on of the world to\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what of it? Your views are not singular, Bickley.”\r\n\r\n“Only this. While you were ill the sweetness of that Lady Yva and her\r\nwonderful qualities as a nurse overcame me. I went to pieces all of a\r\nsudden. I saw in her a realisation of every ideal I had ever\r\nentertained of perfect womanhood. So to speak, my resolves of a\r\nlifetime melted like wax in the sun. Notwithstanding her queer history\r\nand the marvels with which she is mixed up, I wished to marry her. No\r\ndoubt her physical loveliness was at the bottom of it, but, however\r\nthat may be, there it was.”\r\n\r\n“She is beautiful,” I commented; “though I daresay older than she\r\nlooks.”\r\n\r\n“That is a point on which I made no inquiries, and I should advise you,\r\nwhen your turn comes, as no doubt it will, to follow my example. You\r\nknow, Arbuthnot,” he mused, “however lovely a woman may be, it would\r\nput one off if suddenly she announced that she was—let us say—a hundred\r\nand fifty years old.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I admitted, “for nobody wants to marry the contemporary of his\r\ngreat-grandmother. However, she gave her age as twenty-seven years and\r\nthree moons.”\r\n\r\n“And doubtless for once did not tell the truth. But, as she does not\r\nlook more than twenty-five, I think that we may all agree to let it\r\nstand at that, namely, twenty-seven, plus an indefinite period of\r\nsleep. At any rate, she is a sweet and most gracious woman, apparently\r\nin the bloom of youth, and, to cut it short, I fell in love with her.”\r\n\r\n“Like Bastin,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Bastin!” exclaimed Bickley indignantly. “You don’t mean to say that\r\nclerical oaf presumed—well, well, after all, I suppose that he is a\r\nman, so one mustn’t be hard on him. But who could have thought that he\r\nwould run so cunning, even when he knew my sentiments towards the lady?\r\nI hope she told him her mind.”\r\n\r\n“The point is, what did she tell _you_, Bickley?”\r\n\r\n“Me? Oh, she was perfectly charming! It really was a pleasure to be\r\nrefused by her, she puts one so thoroughly at one’s ease.” (Here,\r\nremembering Bastin and his story, I turned away my face to hide a\r\nsmile.) “She said—what did she say exactly? Such a lot that it is\r\ndifficult to remember. Oh! that she was not thinking of marriage. Also,\r\nthat she had not yet recovered from some recent love affair which left\r\nher heart sore, since the time of her sleep did not count. Also, that\r\nher father would never consent, and that the mere idea of such a thing\r\nwould excite his animosity against all of us.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Not quite. She added that she felt wonderfully flattered and extremely\r\nhonoured by what I had been so good as to say to her. She hoped,\r\nhowever, that I should never repeat it or even allude to the matter\r\nagain, as her dearest wish was to be able to look upon me as her most\r\nintimate friend to whom she could always come for sympathy and\r\ncounsel.”\r\n\r\n“What happened then?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, of course, except that I promised everything that she wished,\r\nand mean to stick to it, too. Naturally, I was very sore and upset, but\r\nI am getting over it, having always practised self-control.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry for you, old fellow.”\r\n\r\n“Are you?” he asked suspiciously. “Then perhaps you have tried your\r\nluck, too?”\r\n\r\n“No, Bickley.”\r\n\r\nHis face fell a little at this denial, and he answered:\r\n\r\n“Well, it would have been scarcely decent if you had, seeing how lately\r\nyou were married. But then, so was that artful Bastin. Perhaps you will\r\nget over it—recent marriage, I mean—as he has.” He hesitated a while,\r\nthen went on: “Of course you will, old fellow; I know it, and, what is\r\nmore, I seem to know that when your turn comes you will get a different\r\nanswer. If so, it will keep her in the family as it were—and good luck\r\nto you. Only—”\r\n\r\n“Only what?” I asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n“To be honest, Arbuthnot, I don’t think that there will be real good\r\nluck for any one of us over this woman—not in the ordinary sense, I\r\nmean. The whole business is too strange and superhuman. Is she quite a\r\nwoman, and could she really marry a man as others do?”\r\n\r\n“It is curious that you should talk like that,” I said uneasily. “I\r\nthought that you had made up your mind that the whole business was\r\neither illusion or trickery—I mean, the odd side of it.”\r\n\r\n“If it is illusion, Arbuthnot, then a man cannot marry an illusion. And\r\nif it is trickery, then he will certainly be tricked. But, supposing\r\nthat I am wrong, what then?”\r\n\r\n“You mean, supposing things are as they seem to be?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. In that event, Arbuthnot, I am sure that something will occur to\r\nprevent your being united to a woman who lived thousands of years ago.\r\nI am sorry to say it, but Fate will intervene. Remember, it is the god\r\nof her people that I suppose she worships, and, I may add, to which the\r\nwhole world bows.”\r\n\r\nAt his words a kind of chill fell upon me. I think he saw or divined\r\nit, for after a few remarks upon some indifferent matter, he turned and\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nShortly after this Yva came to sit with me. She studied me for a while\r\nand I studied her. I had reason to do so, for I observed that of late\r\nher dress had become much more modern, and on the present occasion this\r\nstruck me forcibly. I do not know exactly in what the change, or\r\nchanges, consisted, because I am not skilled in such matters and can\r\nonly judge of a woman’s garments by their general effect. At any rate,\r\nthe gorgeous sweeping robes were gone, and though her attire still\r\nlooked foreign and somewhat oriental, with a touch of barbaric\r\nsplendour about it—it was simpler than it had been and showed more of\r\nher figure, which was delicate, yet gracious.\r\n\r\n“You have changed your robes, Lady,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Humphrey. Bastin gave me pictures of those your women wear.” (On\r\nfurther investigation I found that this referred to an old copy of the\r\n_Queen_ newspaper, which, somehow or other, had been brought with the\r\nbooks from the ship.) “I have tried to copy them a little,” she added\r\ndoubtfully.\r\n\r\n“How do you do it? Where do you get the material?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she answered with an airy wave of her hand, “I make it—it is\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand,” I said, but she only smiled radiantly, offering\r\nno further explanation. Then, before I could pursue the subject, she\r\nasked me suddenly:\r\n\r\n“What has Bickley been saying to you about me?”\r\n\r\nI fenced, answering: “I don’t know. Bastin and Bickley talk of little\r\nelse. You seem to have been a great deal with them while I was ill.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a great deal. They are the nearest to you who were so sick. Is it\r\nnot so?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” I answered again. “In my illness it seemed to me that\r\n_you_ were the nearest.”\r\n\r\n“About Bastin’s words I can guess,” she went on. “But I ask again—what\r\nhas Bickley been saying to you about me? Of the first part, let it be;\r\ntell me the rest.”\r\n\r\nI intended to evade her question, but she fixed those violet,\r\ncompelling eyes upon me and I was obliged to answer.\r\n\r\n“I believe you know as well as I do,” I said; “but if you will have it,\r\nit was that you are not as other human women are, and that he who would\r\ntreat you as such, must suffer; that was the gist of it.”\r\n\r\n“Some might be content to suffer for such as I,” she answered with\r\nquiet sweetness. “Even Bastin and Bickley may be content to suffer in\r\ntheir own little ways.”\r\n\r\n“You know that is not what I meant,” I interrupted angrily, for I felt\r\nthat she was throwing reflections on me.\r\n\r\n“No; you meant that you agreed with Bickley that I am not quite a\r\nwoman, as you know women.”\r\n\r\nI was silent, for her words were true.\r\n\r\nThen she blazed out into one of her flashes of splendour, like\r\nsomething that takes fire on an instant; like the faint and distant\r\nstar which flames into sudden glory before the watcher’s telescope.\r\n\r\n“It is true that I am not as your women are—your poor, pale women, the\r\nshadows of an hour with night behind them and before. Because I am\r\nhumble and patient, do you therefore suppose that I am not great? Man\r\nfrom the little country across the sea, I lived when the world was\r\nyoung, and gathered up the ancient wisdom of a greater race than yours,\r\nand when the world is old I think that I still shall live, though not\r\nin this shape or here, with all that wisdom’s essence burning in my\r\nbreast, and with all beauty in my eyes. Bickley does not believe\r\nalthough he worships. You only half believe and do not worship, because\r\nmemory holds you back, and I myself do not understand. I only know\r\nthough knowing so much, still I seek roads to learning, even the humble\r\nroad called Bastin, that yet may lead my feet to the gate of an\r\nimmortal city.”\r\n\r\n“Nor do I understand how all this can be, Yva,” I said feebly, for she\r\ndazzled and overwhelmed me with her blaze of power.\r\n\r\n“No, you do not understand. How can you, when even I cannot? Thus for\r\ntwo hundred and fifty thousand years I slept, and they went by as a\r\nlightning flash. One moment my father gave me the draught and I laid me\r\ndown, the next I awoke with you bending over me, or so it seemed. Yet\r\nwhere was I through all those centuries when for me time had ceased?\r\nTell me, Humphrey, did you dream at all while you were ill? I ask\r\nbecause down in that lonely cavern where I sleep a strange dream came\r\nto me one night. It was of a journey which, as I thought, you and I\r\nseemed to make together, past suns and universes to a very distant\r\nearth. It meant nothing, Humphrey. If you and I chanced to have dreamed\r\nthe same thing, it was only because my dream travelled to you. It is\r\nmost common, or used to be. Humphrey, Bickley is quite right, I am not\r\naltogether as your women are, and I can bring no happiness to any man,\r\nor at the least, to one who cannot wait. Therefore, perhaps you would\r\ndo well to think less of me, as I have counselled Bastin and Bickley.”\r\n\r\nThen again she gazed at me with her wonderful, great eyes, and, shaking\r\nher glittering head a little, smiled and went.\r\n\r\nBut oh! that smile drew my heart after her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nOro and Arbuthnot Travel by Night\r\n\r\n\r\nAs time went on, Oro began to visit me more and more frequently, till\r\nat last scarcely a night went by that he did not appear mysteriously in\r\nmy sleeping-place. The odd thing was that neither Bickley nor Bastin\r\nseemed to be aware of these nocturnal calls. Indeed, when I mentioned\r\nthem on one or two occasions, they stared at me and said it was strange\r\nthat he should have come and gone as they saw nothing of him.\r\n\r\nOn my speaking again of the matter, Bickley at once turned the\r\nconversation, from which I gathered that he believed me to be suffering\r\nfrom delusions consequent on my illness, or perhaps to have taken to\r\ndreaming. This was not wonderful since, as I learned afterwards,\r\nBickley, after he was sure that I was asleep, made a practice of tying\r\na thread across my doorway and of ascertaining at the dawn that it\r\nremained unbroken. But Oro was not to be caught in that way. I suppose,\r\nas it was impossible for him to pass through the latticework of the\r\nopen side of the house, that he undid the thread and fastened it again\r\nwhen he left; at least, that was Bastin’s explanation, or, rather, one\r\nof them. Another was that he crawled beneath it, but this I could not\r\nbelieve. I am quite certain that during all his prolonged existence Oro\r\nnever crawled.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, he came, or seemed to come, and pumped me—I can use no\r\nother word—most energetically as to existing conditions in the world,\r\nespecially those of the civilised countries, their methods of\r\ngovernment, their social state, the physical characteristics of the\r\nvarious races, their religions, the exact degrees of civilisation that\r\nthey had developed, their attainments in art, science and literature,\r\ntheir martial capacities, their laws, and I know not what besides.\r\n\r\nI told him all I could, but did not in the least seem to satisfy his\r\nperennial thirst for information.\r\n\r\n“I should prefer to judge for myself,” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“Why are you so anxious to learn about all these nations, Oro?” I\r\nasked, exhausted.\r\n\r\n“Because the knowledge I gather may affect my plans for the future,” he\r\nreplied darkly.\r\n\r\n“I am told, Oro, that your people acquired the power of transporting\r\nthemselves from place to place.”\r\n\r\n“It is true that the lords of the Sons of Wisdom had such power, and\r\nthat I have it still, O Humphrey.”\r\n\r\n“Then why do you not go to look with your own eyes?” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“Because I should need a guide; one who could explain much in a short\r\ntime,” he said, contemplating me with his burning glance until I began\r\nto feel uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nTo change the subject I asked him whether he had any further\r\ninformation about the war, which he had told me was raging in Europe.\r\n\r\nHe answered: “Not much; only that it was going on with varying success,\r\nand would continue to do so until the nations involved therein were\r\nexhausted,” or so he believed. The war did not seem greatly to interest\r\nOro. It was, he remarked, but a small affair compared to those which he\r\nhad known in the old days. Then he departed, and I went to sleep.\r\n\r\nNext night he appeared again, and, after talking a little on different\r\nsubjects, remarked quietly that he had been thinking over what I had\r\nsaid as to his visiting the modern world, and intended to act upon the\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n“When?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said. “I am going to visit this England of yours and the town\r\nyou call London, and _you_ will accompany me.”\r\n\r\n“It is not possible!” I exclaimed. “We have no ship.”\r\n\r\n“We can travel without a ship,” said Oro.\r\n\r\nI grew alarmed, and suggested that Bastin or Bickley would be a much\r\nbetter companion than I should in my present weak state.\r\n\r\n“An empty-headed man, or one who always doubts and argues, would be\r\nuseless,” he replied sharply. “You shall come and you only.”\r\n\r\nI expostulated; I tried to get up and fly—which, indeed, I did do, in\r\nanother sense.\r\n\r\nBut Oro fixed his eyes upon me and slowly waved his thin hand to and\r\nfro above my head.\r\n\r\nMy senses reeled. Then came a great darkness.\r\n\r\nThey returned again. Now I was standing in an icy, reeking fog, which I\r\nknew could belong to one place only—London, in December, and at my side\r\nwas Oro.\r\n\r\n“Is this the climate of your wonderful city?” he asked, or seemed to\r\nask, in an aggrieved tone.\r\n\r\nI replied that it was, for about three months in the year, and began to\r\nlook about me.\r\n\r\nSoon I found my bearings. In front of me were great piles of buildings,\r\nlooking dim and mysterious in the fog, in which I recognised the Houses\r\nof Parliament and Westminster Abbey, for both could be seen from where\r\nwe stood in front of the Westminster Bridge Station. I explained their\r\nidentity to Oro.\r\n\r\n“Good,” he said. “Let us enter your Place of Talk.”\r\n\r\n“But I am not a member, and we have no passes for the Strangers’\r\nGallery,” I expostulated.\r\n\r\n“We shall not need any,” he replied contemptuously. “Lead on.”\r\n\r\nThus adjured, I crossed the road, Oro following me. Looking round, to\r\nmy horror I saw him right in the path of a motor-bus which seemed to go\r\nover him.\r\n\r\n“There’s an end to Oro,” thought I to myself. “Well, at any rate, I\r\nhave got home.”\r\n\r\nNext instant he was at my side quite undisturbed by the incident of the\r\nbus. We came to a policeman at the door and I hesitated, expecting to\r\nbe challenged. But the policeman seemed absolutely indifferent to our\r\npresence, even when Oro marched past him in his flowing robes. So I\r\nfollowed with a like success. Then I understood that we must be\r\ninvisible.\r\n\r\nWe passed to the lobby, where members were hurrying to and fro, and\r\nconstituents and pressmen were gathered, and so on into the House. Oro\r\nwalked up its floor and took his stand by the table, in front of the\r\nSpeaker. I followed him, none saying us No.\r\n\r\nAs it chanced there was what is called a scene in progress—I think it\r\nwas over Irish matters; the details are of no account. Members shouted,\r\nMinisters prevaricated and grew angry, the Speaker intervened. On the\r\nwhole, it was rather a degrading spectacle. I stood, or seemed to\r\nstand, and watched it all. Oro, in his sweeping robes, which looked so\r\nincongruous in that place, stepped, or seemed to step, up to the\r\nprincipal personages of the Government and Opposition, whom I indicated\r\nto him, and inspected them one by one, as a naturalist might examine\r\nstrange insects. Then, returning to me, he said:\r\n\r\n“Come away; I have seen and heard enough. Who would have thought that\r\nthis nation of yours was struggling for its life in war?”\r\n\r\nWe passed out of the House and somehow came to Trafalgar Square. A\r\nmeeting was in progress there, convened, apparently, to advocate the\r\nrights of Labour, also those of women, also to protest against things\r\nin general, especially the threat of Conscription in the service of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHere the noise was tremendous, and, the fog having lifted somewhat, we\r\ncould see everything. Speakers bawled from the base of Nelson’s column.\r\nTheir supporters cheered, their adversaries rushed at them, and in one\r\nor two instances succeeded in pulling them down. A woman climbed up and\r\nbegan to scream out something which could only be heard by a few\r\nreporters gathered round her. I thought her an unpleasant-looking\r\nperson, and evidently her remarks were not palatable to the majority of\r\nher auditors. There was a rush, and she was dragged from the base of\r\none of Landseer’s lions on which she stood. Her skirt was half rent off\r\nher and her bodice split down the back. Finally, she was conveyed away,\r\nkicking, biting, and scratching, by a number of police. It was a\r\ndisgusting sight, and tumult ensued.\r\n\r\n“Let us go,” said Oro. “Your officers of order are good; the rest is\r\nnot good.”\r\n\r\nLater we found ourselves opposite to the doors of a famous restaurant\r\nwhere a magnificent and gigantic commissionaire helped ladies from\r\nmotor-cars, receiving in return money from the men who attended on\r\nthem. We entered; it was the hour of dinner. The place sparkled with\r\ngems, and the naked backs of the women gleamed in the electric light.\r\nCourse followed upon course; champagne flowed, a fine band played,\r\neverything was costly; everything was, in a sense, repellent.\r\n\r\n“These are the wealthy citizens of a nation engaged in fighting for its\r\nlife,” remarked Oro to me, stroking his long beard. “It is interesting,\r\nvery interesting. Let us go.”\r\n\r\nWe went out and on, passing a public-house crowded with women who had\r\nleft their babies in charge of children in the icy street. It was a day\r\nof Intercession for the success of England in the war. This was\r\nplacarded everywhere. We entered, or, rather, Oro did, I following him,\r\none of the churches in the Strand where an evening service was in\r\nprogress. The preacher in the pulpit, a very able man, was holding\r\nforth upon the necessity for national repentance and self-denial; also\r\nof prayer. In the body of the church exactly thirty-two people, most of\r\nthem elderly women, were listening to him with an air of placid\r\nacceptance.\r\n\r\n“The priest talks well, but his hearers are not many,” said Oro. “Let\r\nus go.”\r\n\r\nWe came to the flaunting doors of a great music-hall and passed through\r\nthem, though to others this would have been impossible, for the place\r\nwas filled from floor to roof. In its promenades men were drinking and\r\nsmoking, while gaudy women, painted and low-robed, leered at them. On\r\nthe stage girls danced, throwing their legs above their heads. Then\r\nthey vanished amidst applause, and a woman in a yellow robe, who\r\npretended to be tipsy, sang a horrible and vulgar song full of topical\r\nallusions, which was received with screams of delight by the enormous\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n“Here the hearers are very many, but those to whom they listen do not\r\ntalk well. Let us go,” said Oro, and we went.\r\n\r\nAt a recruiting station we paused a moment to consider posters supposed\r\nto be attractive, the very sight of which sent a thrill of shame\r\nthrough me. I remember that the inscription under one of them was:\r\n“What will your best girl say?”\r\n\r\n“Is that how you gather your soldiers? Later it will be otherwise,”\r\nsaid Oro, and passed on.\r\n\r\nWe reached Blackfriars and entered a hall at the doors of which stood\r\nwomen in poke-bonnets, very sweet-faced, earnest-looking women. Their\r\ncountenances seemed to strike Oro, and he motioned me to follow him\r\ninto the hall. It was quite full of a miserable-looking congregation of\r\nperhaps a thousand people. A man in the blue and red uniform of the\r\nSalvation Army was preaching of duty to God and country, of\r\nself-denial, hope and forgiveness. He seemed a humble person, but his\r\nwords were earnest, and love flowed from him. Some of his miserable\r\ncongregation wept, others stared at him open-mouthed, a few, who were\r\nvery weary, slept. He called them up to receive pardon, and a number,\r\nled by the sweet-faced women, came and knelt before him. He and others\r\nwhispered to them, then seemed to bless them, and they rose with their\r\nfaces changed.\r\n\r\n“Let us go,” said Oro. “I do not understand these rites, but at last in\r\nyour great and wonderful city I have seen something that is pure and\r\nnoble.”\r\n\r\nWe went out. In the streets there was great excitement. People ran to\r\nand fro pointing upwards. Searchlights, like huge fingers of flame,\r\nstole across the sky; guns boomed. At last, in the glare of a\r\nsearchlight, we saw a long and sinister object floating high above us\r\nand gleaming as though it were made of silver. Flashes came from it\r\nfollowed by terrible booming reports that grew nearer and nearer. A\r\nhouse collapsed with a crash just behind us.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Oro, with a smile. “I know this—it is war, war as it was\r\nwhen the world was different and yet the same.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a motor-bus rumbled past. Another flash and explosion. A\r\nman, walking with his arms round the waist of a girl just ahead of us;\r\nseemed to be tossed up and to melt. The girl fell in a heap on the\r\npavement; somehow her head and her feet had come quite close together\r\nand yet she appeared to be sitting down. The motor-bus burst into\r\nfragments and its passengers hurtled through the air, mere hideous\r\nlumps that had been men and women. The head of one of them came dancing\r\ndown the pavement towards us, a cigar still stuck in the corner of its\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n“Yes, this is war,” said Oro. “It makes me young again to see it. But\r\ndoes this city of yours understand?”\r\n\r\nWe watched a while. A crowd gathered. Policemen ran up, ambulances\r\ncame. The place was cleared, and all that was left they carried away. A\r\nfew minutes later another man passed by with his arm round the waist of\r\nanother girl. Another motor-bus rumbled up, and, avoiding the hole in\r\nthe roadway, travelled on, its conductor keeping a keen look-out for\r\nfares.\r\n\r\nThe street was cleared by the police; the airship continued its course,\r\nspawning bombs in the distance, and vanished. The incident was closed.\r\n\r\n“Let us go home,” said Oro. “I have seen enough of your great and\r\nwonderful city. I would rest in the quiet of Nyo and think.”\r\n\r\nThe next thing that I remember was the voice of Bastin, saying:\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mind, Arbuthnot, I wish that you would get up. The\r\nGlittering Lady (he still called her that) is coming here to have a\r\ntalk with me which I should prefer to be private. Excuse me for\r\ndisturbing you, but you have overslept yourself; indeed, I think it\r\nmust be nine o’clock, so far as I can judge by the sun, for my watch is\r\nvery erratic now, ever since Bickley tried to clean it.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry, my dear fellow,” I said sleepily, “but do you know I\r\nthought I was in London—in fact, I could swear that I have been there.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” interrupted Bickley, who had followed Bastin into the hut,\r\ngiving me that doubtful glance with which I was now familiar, “I wish\r\nto goodness that you had brought back an evening paper with you.”\r\n\r\nA night or two later I was again suddenly awakened to feel that Oro was\r\napproaching. He appeared like a ghost in the bright moonlight, greeted\r\nme, and said:\r\n\r\n“Tonight, Humphrey, we must make another journey. I would visit the\r\nseat of the war.”\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to go,” I said feebly.\r\n\r\n“What you wish does not matter,” he replied. “_I_ wish that you should\r\ngo, and therefore you must.”\r\n\r\n“Listen, Oro,” I exclaimed. “I do not like this business; it seems\r\ndangerous to me.”\r\n\r\n“There is no danger if you are obedient, Humphrey.”\r\n\r\n“I think there is. I do not understand what happens. Do you make use of\r\nwhat the Lady Yva called the Fourth Dimension, so that our bodies pass\r\nover the seas and through mountains, like the vibrations of our\r\nWireless, of which I was speaking to you?”\r\n\r\n“No, Humphrey. That method is good and easy, but I do not use it\r\nbecause if I did we should be visible in the places which we visit,\r\nsince there all the atoms that make a man would collect together again\r\nand be a man.”\r\n\r\n“What, then, do you do?” I asked, exasperated.\r\n\r\n“Man, Humphrey, is not one; he is many. Thus, amongst other things he\r\nhas a Double, which can see and hear, as he can in the flesh, if it is\r\nseparated from the flesh.”\r\n\r\n“The old Egyptians believed that,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Did they? Doubtless they inherited the knowledge from us, the Sons of\r\nWisdom. The cup of our learning was so full that, keep it secret as we\r\nwould, from time to time some of it overflowed among the vulgar, and\r\ndoubtless thus the light of our knowledge still burns feebly in the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nI reflected to myself that whatever might be their other\r\ncharacteristics, the Sons of Wisdom had lost that of modesty, but I\r\nonly asked how he used his Double, supposing that it existed.\r\n\r\n“Very easily,” he answered. “In sleep it can be drawn from the body and\r\nsent upon its mission by one that is its master.”\r\n\r\n“Then while you were asleep for all those thousands of years your\r\nDouble must have made many journeys.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” he replied quietly, “and my spirit also, which is another\r\npart of me that may have dwelt in the bodies of other men. But\r\nunhappily, if so I forget, and that is why I have so much to learn and\r\nmust even make use of such poor instruments as you, Humphrey.”\r\n\r\n“Then if I sleep and you distil my Double out of me, I suppose that you\r\nsleep too. In that case who distils your Double out of _you_, Lord\r\nOro?”\r\n\r\nHe grew angry and answered:\r\n\r\n“Ask no more questions, blind and ignorant as you are. It is your part\r\nnot to examine, but to obey. Sleep now,” and again he waved his hand\r\nover me.\r\n\r\nIn an instant, as it seemed, we were standing in a grey old town that I\r\njudged from its appearance must be either in northern France or\r\nBelgium. It was much shattered by bombardment; the church, for\r\ninstance, was a ruin; also many of the houses had been burnt. Now,\r\nhowever, no firing was going on for the town had been taken. The\r\nstreets were full of armed men wearing the German uniform and helmet.\r\nWe passed down them and were able to see into the houses. In some of\r\nthese were German soldiers engaged in looting and in other things so\r\nhorrible that even the unmoved Oro turned away his head.\r\n\r\nWe came to the market-place. It was crowded with German troops, also\r\nwith a great number of the inhabitants of the town, most of them\r\nelderly men and women with children, who had fallen into their power.\r\nThe Germans, under the command of officers, were dragging the men from\r\nthe arms of their wives and children to one side, and with rifle-butts\r\nbeating back the screaming women. Among the men I noticed two or three\r\npriests who were doing their best to soothe their companions and even\r\ngiving them absolution in hurried whispers.\r\n\r\nAt length the separation was effected, whereon at a hoarse word of\r\ncommand, a company of soldiers began to fire at the men and continued\r\ndoing so until all had fallen. Then petty officers went among the\r\nslaughtered and with pistols blew out the brains of any who still\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\n“These butchers, you say, are Germans?” asked Oro of me.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, sick with horror, for though I was in the mind and\r\nnot in the body, I could feel as the mind does. Had I been in the body\r\nalso, I should have fainted.\r\n\r\n“Then we need not waste time in visiting their country. It is enough;\r\nlet us go on.”\r\n\r\nWe passed out into the open land and came to a village. It was in the\r\noccupation of German cavalry. Two of them held a little girl of nine or\r\nten, one by her body, the other by her right hand. An officer stood\r\nbetween them with a drawn sword fronting the terrified child. He was a\r\nhorrible, coarse-faced man who looked to me as though he had been\r\ndrinking.\r\n\r\n“I’ll teach the young devil to show us the wrong road and let those\r\nFrench swine escape,” he shouted, and struck with the sword. The girl’s\r\nright hand fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n“War as practised by the Germans!” remarked Oro. Then he stepped, or\r\nseemed to step up to the man and whispered, or seemed to whisper, in\r\nhis ear.\r\n\r\nI do not know what tongue or what spirit speech he used, or what he\r\nsaid, but the bloated-faced brute turned pale. Yes, he drew sick with\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n“I think there are spirits in this place,” he said with a German oath.\r\n“I could have sworn that something told me that I was going to die.\r\nMount!”\r\n\r\nThe Uhlans mounted and began to ride away.\r\n\r\n“Watch,” said Oro.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke out of a dark cloud appeared an aeroplane. Its pilot saw\r\nthe band of Germans beneath and dropped a bomb. The aim was good, for\r\nthe missile exploded in the midst of them, causing a great cloud of\r\ndust from which arose the screams of men and horses.\r\n\r\n“Come and see,” said Oro.\r\n\r\nWe were there. Out of the cloud of dust appeared one man galloping\r\nfuriously. He was a young fellow who, as I noted, had turned his head\r\naway and hidden his eyes with his hand when the horror was done yonder.\r\nAll the others were dead except the officer who had worked the deed. He\r\nwas still living, but both his hands and one of his feet had been blown\r\naway. Presently he died, screaming to God for mercy.\r\n\r\nWe passed on and came to a barn with wide doors that swung a little in\r\nthe wind, causing the rusted hinges to scream like a creature in pain.\r\nOn each of these doors hung a dead man crucified. The hat of one of\r\nthem lay upon the ground, and I knew from the shape of it that he was a\r\nColonial soldier.\r\n\r\n“Did you not tell me,” said Oro after surveying them, “that these\r\nGermans are of your Christian faith?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and the Name of God is always on their ruler’s lips.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he said, “I am glad that I worship Fate. Bastin the priest need\r\ntrouble me no more.”\r\n\r\n“There is something behind Fate,” I said, quoting Bastin himself.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps. So indeed I have always held, but after much study I cannot\r\nunderstand the manner of its working. Fate is enough for me.”\r\n\r\nWe went on and came to a flat country that was lined with ditches, all\r\nof them full of men, Germans on one side, English and French upon the\r\nother. A terrible bombardment shook the earth, the shells raining upon\r\nthe ditches. Presently that from the English guns ceased and out of the\r\ntrenches in front of them thousands of men were vomited, who ran\r\nforward through a hail of fire in which scores and hundreds fell,\r\nacross an open piece of ground that was pitted with shell craters. They\r\ncame to barbed wire defenses, or what remained of them, cut the wire\r\nwith nippers and pulled up the posts. Then through the gaps they surged\r\nin, shouting and hurling hand grenades. They reached the German\r\ntrenches, they leapt into them and from those holes arose a hellish\r\ndin. Pistols were fired and everywhere bayonets flashed.\r\n\r\nBehind them rushed a horde of little, dark-skinned men, Indians who\r\ncarried great knives in their hands. Those leapt over the first trench\r\nand running on with wild yells, dived into the second, those who were\r\nleft of them, and there began hacking with their knives at the\r\ndefenders and the soldiers who worked the spitting maxim guns. In\r\ntwenty minutes it was over; those lines of trenches were taken, and\r\nonce more from either side the guns began to boom.\r\n\r\n“War again,” said Oro, “clean, honest war, such as the god I call Fate\r\ndecrees for man. I have seen enough. Now I would visit those whom you\r\ncall Turks. I understand they have another worship and perhaps they are\r\nnobler than these Christians.”\r\n\r\nWe came to a hilly country which I recognised as Armenia, for once I\r\ntravelled there, and stopped on a seashore. Here were the Turks in\r\nthousands. They were engaged in driving before them mobs of men, women\r\nand children in countless numbers. On and on they drove them till they\r\nreached the shore. There they massacred them with bayonets, with\r\nbullets, or by drowning. I remember a dreadful scene of a poor woman\r\nstanding up to her waist in the water. Three children were clinging to\r\nher—but I cannot go on, really I cannot go on. In the end a Turk waded\r\nout and bayoneted her while she strove to protect the last living child\r\nwith her poor body whence it sprang.\r\n\r\n“These, I understand,” said Oro, pointing to the Turkish soldiers,\r\n“worship a prophet who they say is the voice of God.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “and therefore they massacre these who are\r\nChristians because they worship God without a prophet.”\r\n\r\n“And what do the Christians massacre each other for?”\r\n\r\n“Power and the wealth and territories that are power. That is, the King\r\nof the Germans wishes to rule the world, but the other Nations do not\r\ndesire his dominion. Therefore they fight for Liberty and Justice.”\r\n\r\n“As it was, so it is and shall be,” remarked Oro, “only with this\r\ndifference. In the old world some were wise, but here—” and he stopped,\r\nhis eyes fixed upon the Armenian woman struggling in her death agony\r\nwhile the murderer drowned her child, then added: “Let us go.”\r\n\r\nOur road ran across the sea. On it we saw a ship so large that it\r\nattracted Oro’s attention, and for once he expressed astonishment.\r\n\r\n“In my day,” he said, “we had no vessels of this greatness in the\r\nworld. I wish to look upon it.”\r\n\r\nWe landed on the deck of the ship, or rather the floating palace, and\r\nexamined her. She carried many passengers, some English, some American,\r\nand I pointed out to Oro the differences between the two peoples. These\r\nwere not, he remarked, very wide except that the American women wore\r\nmore jewels, also that some of the American men, to whom we listened as\r\nthey conversed, spoke of the greatness of their country, whereas the\r\nEnglishmen, if they said anything concerning it, belittled their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nPresently, on the surface of the sea at a little distance appeared\r\nsomething strange, a small and ominous object like a can on the top of\r\na pole. A voice cried out “_Submarine!_” and everyone near rushed to\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n“If those Germans try any of their monkey tricks on us, I guess the\r\nUnited States will give them hell,” said another voice near by.\r\n\r\nThen from the direction of the pole with the tin can on the top of it,\r\ncame something which caused a disturbance in the smooth water and\r\nbubbles to rise in its wake.\r\n\r\n“A torpedo!” cried some.\r\n\r\n“Shut your mouth,” said the voice. “Who dare torpedo a vessel full of\r\nthe citizens of the United States?”\r\n\r\nNext came a booming crash and a flood of upthrown water, in the wash of\r\nwhich that speaker was carried away into the deep. Then horror! horror!\r\nhorror! indescribable, as the mighty vessel went wallowing to her doom.\r\nBoats launched; boats overset; boats dragged under by her rush through\r\nthe water which could not be stayed. Maddened men and women running to\r\nand fro, their eyes starting from their heads, clasping children,\r\nfastening lifebelts over their costly gowns, or appearing from their\r\ncabins, their hands filled with jewels that they sought to save. Orders\r\ncried from high places by stern-faced officers doing their duty to the\r\nlast. And a little way off that thin pole with a tin can on the top of\r\nit watching its work.\r\n\r\nThen the plunge of the enormous ship into the deep, its huge screws\r\nstill whirling in the air and the boom of the bursting boilers. Lastly\r\neverything gone save a few boats floating on the quiet sea and around\r\nthem dots that were the heads of struggling human beings.\r\n\r\n“Let us go home,” said Oro. “I grow tired of this war of your Christian\r\npeoples. It is no better than that of the barbarian nations of the\r\nearly world. Indeed it is worse, since then we worshipped Fate and but\r\na few of us had wisdom. Now you all claim wisdom and declare that you\r\nworship a God of Mercy.”\r\n\r\nWith these words still ringing in my ears I woke up upon the Island of\r\nOrofena, filled with terror at the horrible possibilities of nightmare.\r\n\r\nWhat else could it be? There was the brown and ancient cone of the\r\nextinct volcano. There were the tall palms of the main island and the\r\nlake glittering in the sunlight between. There was Bastin conducting a\r\nkind of Sunday school of Orofenans upon the point of the Rock of\r\nOfferings, as now he had obtained the leave of Oro to do. There was the\r\nmouth of the cave, and issuing from it Bickley, who by help of one of\r\nthe hurricane lamps had been making an examination of the buried\r\nremains of what he supposed to be flying machines. Without doubt it was\r\nnightmare, and I would say nothing to them about it for fear of\r\nmockery.\r\n\r\nYet two nights later Oro came again and after the usual preliminaries,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Humphrey, this night we will visit that mighty American nation, of\r\nwhich you have told me so much, and the other Neutral Countries.”\r\n\r\n[At this point there is a gap in Mr. Arbuthnot’s M.S., so Oro’s\r\nreflections on the Neutral Nations, if any, remain unrecorded. It\r\ncontinues:]\r\n\r\nOn our homeward way we passed over Australia, making a detour to do so.\r\nOf the cities Oro took no account. He said that they were too large and\r\ntoo many, but the country interested him so much that I gathered he\r\nmust have given great attention to agriculture at some time in the\r\npast. He pointed out to me that the climate was fine, and the land so\r\nfertile that with a proper system of irrigation and water-storage it\r\ncould support tens of millions and feed not only itself but a great\r\npart of the outlying world.\r\n\r\n“But where are the people?” he asked. “Outside of those huge hives,”\r\nand he indicated the great cities, “I see few of them, though doubtless\r\nsome of the men are fighting in this war. Well, in the days to come\r\nthis must be remedied.”\r\n\r\nOver New Zealand, which he found beautiful, he shook his head for the\r\nsame reason.\r\n\r\nOn another night we visited the East. China with its teeming millions\r\ninterested him extremely, partly because he declared these to be the\r\ndescendants of one of the barbarian nations of his own day. He made a\r\nremark to the effect that this race had always possessed points and\r\ncapacities, and that he thought that with proper government and\r\ninstruction their Chinese offspring would be of use in a regenerated\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFor the Japanese and all that they had done in two short generations,\r\nhe went so far as to express real admiration, a very rare thing with\r\nOro, who was by nature critical. I could see that mentally he put a\r\nwhite mark against their name.\r\n\r\nIndia, too, really moved him. He admired the ancient buildings at Delhi\r\nand Agra, especially the Taj Mahal. This, he declared, was reminiscent\r\nof some of the palaces that stood at Pani, the capital city of the Sons\r\nof Wisdom, before it was destroyed by the Barbarians.\r\n\r\nThe English administration of the country also attracted a word of\r\npraise from him, I think because of its rather autocratic character.\r\nIndeed he went so far as to declare that, with certain modifications,\r\nit should be continued in the future, and even to intimate that he\r\nwould bear the matter in mind. Democratic forms of government had no\r\ncharms for Oro.\r\n\r\nAmongst other places, we stopped at Benares and watched the funeral\r\nrites in progress upon the banks of the holy Ganges. The bearers of the\r\ndead brought the body of a woman wrapped in a red shroud that glittered\r\nwith tinsel ornaments. Coming forward at a run and chanting as they\r\nran, they placed it upon the stones for a little while, then lifted it\r\nup again and carried it down the steps to the edge of the river. Here\r\nthey took water and poured it over the corpse, thus performing the rite\r\nof the baptism of death. This done, they placed its feet in the water\r\nand left it looking very small and lonely. Presently appeared a tall,\r\nwhite-draped woman who took her stand by the body and wailed. It was\r\nthe dead one’s mother. Again the bearers approached and laid the corpse\r\nupon the flaming pyre.\r\n\r\n“These rites are ancient,” said Oro. “When I ruled as King of the World\r\nthey were practised in this very place. It is pleasant to me to find\r\nsomething that has survived the changefulness of Time. Let it continue\r\ntill the end.”\r\n\r\nHere I will cease. These experiences that I have recorded are but\r\nsamples, for also we visited Russia and other countries. Perhaps, too,\r\nthey were not experiences at all, but only dreams consequent on my\r\nstate of health. I cannot say for certain, though much of what I seemed\r\nto see fitted in very well indeed with what I learned in after days,\r\nand certainly at the time they appeared as real as though Oro and I had\r\nstood together upon those various shores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nLove’s Eternal Altar\r\n\r\n\r\nNow of all these happenings I said very little to Bastin and Bickley.\r\nThe former would not have understood them, and the latter attributed\r\nwhat I did tell him to mental delusions following on my illness. To Yva\r\nI did speak about them, however, imploring her to explain their origin\r\nand to tell me whether or not they were but visions of the night.\r\n\r\nShe listened to me, as I thought not without anxiety, from which I\r\ngathered that she too feared for my mind. It was not so, however, for\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n“I am glad, O Humphrey, that your journeyings are done, since such\r\nthings are not without danger. He who travels far out of the body may\r\nchance to return there no more.”\r\n\r\n“But were they journeyings, or dreams?” I asked.\r\n\r\nShe evaded a direct answer.\r\n\r\n“I cannot say. My father has great powers. I do not know them all. It\r\nis possible that they were neither journeyings nor dreams. Mayhap he\r\nused you as the sorcerers in the old days used the magic glass, and\r\nafter he had put his spell upon you, read in your mind that which\r\npasses elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nI understood her to refer to what we call clairvoyance, when the person\r\nentranced reveals secret or distant things to the entrancer. This is a\r\nmore or less established phenomenon and much less marvelous than the\r\nactual transportation of the spiritual self through space. Only I never\r\nknew of an instance in which the seer, on awaking, remembered the\r\nthings that he had seen, as in my case. There, however, the matter\r\nrested, or rests, for I could extract nothing more from Yva, who\r\nappeared to me to have her orders on the point.\r\n\r\nNor did Oro ever talk of what I had seemed to see in his company,\r\nalthough he continued from time to time to visit me at night. But now\r\nour conversation was of other matters. As Bastin had discovered, by\r\nsome extraordinary gift he had soon learned how to read the English\r\nlanguage, although he never spoke a single word in that tongue. Among\r\nour reference books that we brought from the yacht, was a thin paper\r\nedition of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_, which he borrowed when he\r\ndiscovered that it contained compressed information about the various\r\ncountries of the world, also concerning almost every other matter. My\r\nbelief is that within a month or so that marvelous old man not only\r\nread this stupendous work from end to end, but that he remembered\r\neverything of interest which it contained. At least, he would appear\r\nand show the fullest acquaintance with certain subjects or places,\r\nseeking further light from me concerning them, which very often I was\r\nquite unable to give him.\r\n\r\nAn accident, as it chanced, whereof I need not set out the details,\r\ncaused me to discover that his remarkable knowledge was limited. Thus,\r\nat one period, he knew little about any modern topic which began with a\r\nletter later in the alphabet than, let us say, C. A few days afterwards\r\nhe was acquainted with those up to F, or G; and so on till he reached\r\nZ, when he appeared to me to know everything, and returned the book.\r\nNow, indeed, he was a monument of learning, very ancient and very new,\r\nand with some Encyclopedia-garnered facts or deductions of what had\r\nhappened between.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he took to astronomical research, for more than once we saw\r\nhim standing on the rock at night studying the heavens. On one of these\r\noccasions, when he had the two metal plates, of which I have spoken, in\r\nhis hands, I ventured to approach and ask what he did. He replied that\r\nhe was checking his calculations that he found to be quite correct, an\r\nexact period of two hundred and fifty thousand years having gone by\r\nsince he laid himself down to sleep. Then, by aid of the plates, he\r\npointed out to me certain alterations that had happened during that\r\nperiod in the positions of some of the stars.\r\n\r\nFor instance, he showed me one which, by help of my glasses, I\r\nrecognised as Sirius, and remarked that two hundred and fifty thousand\r\nyears ago it was further away and much smaller. Now it was precisely in\r\nthe place and of the size which he had predicted, and he pointed to it\r\non his prophetic map. Again he indicated a star that the night-glass\r\ntold me was Capella, which, I suppose, is one of the most brilliant\r\nstars in the sky, and showed me that on the map he had made two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand years ago, it did not exist, as then it was too far\r\nnorth to appear thereon. Still, he observed, the passage of this vast\r\nperiod of time had produced but little effect upon the face of the\r\nheavens. To the human eye the majority of the stars had not moved so\r\nvery far.\r\n\r\n“And yet they travel fast, O Humphrey,” he said. “Consider then how\r\ngreat is their journey between the time they gather and that day when,\r\nworn-out, once more they melt to vaporous gas. You think me long-lived\r\nwho compared to them exist but a tiny fraction of a second, nearly all\r\nof which I have been doomed to pass in sleep. And, Humphrey, I desire\r\nto live—I, who have great plans and would shake the world. But my day\r\ndraws in; a few brief centuries and I shall be gone, and—whither,\r\nwhither?”\r\n\r\n“If you lived as long as those stars, the end would be the same, Oro.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but the life of the stars is very long, millions of millions of\r\nyears; also, after death, they reform, as other stars. But shall I\r\nreform as another Oro? With all my wisdom, I do not know. It is known\r\nto Fate only—Fate-the master of worlds and men and the gods they\r\nworship—Fate, whom it may please to spill my gathered knowledge, to be\r\nlost in the sands of Time.”\r\n\r\n“It seems that you are great,” I said, “and have lived long and learned\r\nmuch. Yet the end of it is that your lot is neither worse nor better\r\nthan that of us creatures of an hour.”\r\n\r\n“It is so, Humphrey. Presently you will die, and within a few centuries\r\nI shall die also and be as you are. You believe that you will live\r\nagain eternally. It may be so because you _do_ believe, since Fate\r\nallows Faith to shape the future, if only for a little while. But in me\r\nWisdom has destroyed Faith and therefore I must die. Even if I sleep\r\nagain for tens of thousands of years, what will it help me, seeing that\r\nsleep is unconsciousness and that I shall only wake again to die, since\r\nsleep does not restore to us our youth?”\r\n\r\nHe ceased, and walked up and down the rock with a troubled mien. Then\r\nhe stood in front of me and said in a triumphant voice:\r\n\r\n“At least, while I live I will rule, and then let come what may come. I\r\nknow that you do not believe, and the first victory of this new day of\r\nmine shall be to make you believe. I have great powers and you shall\r\nsee them at work, and afterwards, if things go right, rule with me for\r\na little while, perhaps, as the first of my subjects. Hearken now; in\r\none small matter my calculations, made so long ago, have gone wrong.\r\nThey showed me that at this time a day of earthquakes, such as those\r\nthat again and again have rocked and split the world, would recur. But\r\nnow it seems that there is an error, a tiny error of eleven hundred\r\nyears, which must go by before those earthquakes come.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure,” I suggested humbly, “that there is not also an error in\r\nthose star-maps you hold?”\r\n\r\n“I am sure, Humphrey. Some day, who knows? You may return to your world\r\nof modern men who, I gather, have knowledge of the great science of\r\nastronomy. Take now these maps with which I have done, and submit them\r\nto the most learned of those men, and let them tell you whether I was\r\nright or wrong in what I wrote upon this metal two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand years ago. Whatever else is false, at least the stars in their\r\nmotions can never die.”\r\n\r\nThen he handed me the maps and was gone. I have them today, and if ever\r\nthis book is published, they will appear with it, that those who are\r\nqualified may judge of them and of the truth or otherwise of Oro’s\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nFrom that night forward for quite a long time I saw Oro no more. Nor\r\nindeed did any of us, since for some reason of his own he forbade us to\r\nvisit the underground city of Nyo. Oddly enough, however, he commanded\r\nYva to bring down the spaniel, Tommy, to be with him from time to time.\r\nWhen I asked her why, she said it was because he was lonely and desired\r\nthe dog’s companionship. It seemed to us very strange that this\r\nsuper-man, who had the wisdom of ten Solomons gathered in one within\r\nhis breast, should yet desire the company of a little dog. What then\r\nwas the worth of learning and long life, or, indeed, of anything? Well,\r\nSolomon himself asked the question ages since, and could give no answer\r\nsave that all is vanity.\r\n\r\nI noted about this time that Yva began to grow very sad and troubled;\r\nindeed, looking at her suddenly on two or three occasions, I saw that\r\nher beautiful eyes were aswim with tears. Also, I noted that always as\r\nshe grew sadder she became, in a sense, more human. In the beginning\r\nshe was, as it were, far away. One could never forget that she was the\r\nchild of some alien race whose eyes had looked upon the world when, by\r\ncomparison, humanity was young; at times, indeed, she might have been\r\nthe denizen of another planet, strayed to earth. Although she never\r\nflaunted it, one felt that her simplest word hid secret wisdom; that to\r\nher books were open in which we could not read. Moreover, as I have\r\nsaid, occasionally power flamed out of her, power that was beyond our\r\nken and understanding.\r\n\r\nYet with all this there was nothing elfish about her, nothing uncanny.\r\nShe was always kind, and, as we could feel, innately good and\r\ngentle-hearted, just a woman made half-divine by gifts and experience\r\nthat others lack. She did not even make use of her wondrous beauty to\r\nmadden men, as she might well have done had she been so minded. It is\r\ntrue that both Bastin and Bickley fell in love with her, but that was\r\nonly because all with whom she had to do must love her, and then, when\r\nshe told them that it might not be, it was in such a fashion that no\r\nsoreness was left behind. They went on loving her, that was all, but as\r\nmen love their sisters or their daughters; as we conceive that they may\r\nlove in that land where there is no marrying or giving in marriage.\r\n\r\nBut now, in her sadness, she drew ever nearer to us, and especially to\r\nmyself, more in tune with our age and thought. In truth, save for her\r\nroyal and glittering loveliness in which there was some quality which\r\nproclaimed her of another blood, and for that reserve of hidden power\r\nwhich at times would look out of her eyes or break through her words,\r\nshe might in most ways have been some singularly gifted and beautiful\r\nmodern woman.\r\n\r\nThe time has come when I must speak of my relations with Yva and of\r\ntheir climax. As may have been guessed, from the first I began to love\r\nher. While the weeks went on that love grew and grew, until it utterly\r\npossessed me, although for a certain reason connected with one dead, at\r\nfirst I fought against it. Yet it did not develop quite in the fashion\r\nthat might have been expected. There was no blazing up of passion’s\r\nfire; rather was there an ever-increasing glow of the holiest\r\naffection, till at last it became a lamp by which I must guide my feet\r\nthrough life and death. This love of mine seemed not of earth but from\r\nthe stars. As yet I had said nothing to her of it because in some way I\r\nfelt that she did not wish me to do so, felt also that she was well\r\naware of all that passed within my heart, and desired, as it were, to\r\ngive it time to ripen there. Then one day there came a change, and\r\nthough no glance or touch of Yva’s told me so, I knew that the bars\r\nwere taken down and that I might speak.\r\n\r\nIt was a night of full moon. All that afternoon she had been talking to\r\nBastin apart, I suppose about religion, for I saw that he had some\r\nbooks in his hand from which he was expounding something to her in his\r\nslow, earnest way. Then she came and sat with us while we took our\r\nevening meal. I remember that mine consisted of some of the Life-water\r\nwhich she had brought with her and fruit, for, as I think I have said,\r\nI had acquired her dislike to meat, also that she ate some plantains,\r\nthrowing the skins for Tommy to fetch and laughing at his play. When it\r\nwas over, Bastin and Bickley went away together, whether by chance or\r\ndesign I do not know, and she said to me suddenly:\r\n\r\n“Humphrey, you have often asked me about the city Pani, of which a\r\nlittle portion of the ruins remains upon this island, the rest being\r\nburied beneath the waters. If you wish I will show you where our royal\r\npalace was before the barbarians destroyed it with their airships. The\r\nmoon is very bright, and by it we can see.”\r\n\r\nI nodded, for, knowing what she meant, somehow I could not answer her,\r\nand we began the ascent of the hill. She explained to me the plan of\r\nthe palace when we reached the ruins, showing me where her own\r\napartments had been, and the rest. It was very strange to hear her\r\nquietly telling of buildings which had stood and of things that had\r\nhappened over two hundred and fifty thousand years before, much as any\r\nmodern lady might do of a house that had been destroyed a month ago by\r\nan earthquake or a Zeppelin bomb, while she described the details of a\r\ndisaster which now frightened her no more. I think it was then that for\r\nthe first time I really began to believe that in fact Yva had lived all\r\nthose æons since and been as she still appeared.\r\n\r\nWe passed from the palace to the ruins of the temple, through what, as\r\nshe said, had been a pleasure-garden, pointing out where a certain\r\navenue of rare palms had grown, down which once it was her habit to\r\nwalk in the cool of the day. Or, rather, there were two terraced\r\ntemples, one dedicated to Fate like that in the underground city of\r\nNyo, and the other to Love. Of the temple to Fate she told me her\r\nfather had been the High Priest, and of the temple to Love she was the\r\nHigh Priestess.\r\n\r\nThen it was that I understood why she had brought me here.\r\n\r\nShe led the way to a marble block covered with worn-out carvings and\r\nalmost buried in the debris. This, she said, was the altar of\r\nofferings. I asked her what offerings, and she replied with a smile:\r\n\r\n“Only wine, to signify the spirit of life, and flowers to symbolise its\r\nfragrance,” and she laid her finger on a cup-like depression, still\r\napparent in the marble, into which the wine was poured.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I gathered that there was nothing coarse or bacchanalian about\r\nthis worship of a prototype of Aphrodite; on the contrary, that it was\r\nmore or less spiritual and ethereal. We sat down on the altar stone. I\r\nwondered a little that she should have done so, but she read my\r\nthought, and answered:\r\n\r\n“Sometimes we change our faiths, Humphrey, or perhaps they grow. Also,\r\nhave I not told you that sacrifices were offered on this altar?” and\r\nshe sighed and smiled.\r\n\r\nI do not know which was the sweeter, the smile or the sigh.\r\n\r\nWe looked at the water glimmering in the crater beneath us on the edge\r\nof which we sat. We looked at heaven above in which the great moon\r\nsailed royally. Then we looked into each other’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“I love you,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I know it,” she answered gently. “You have loved me from the first,\r\nhave you not? Even when I lay asleep in the coffin you began to love\r\nme, but until you dreamed a certain dream you would not admit it.”\r\n\r\n“Yva, what was the meaning of that dream?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot say, Humphrey. But I tell you this. As you will learn in\r\ntime, one spirit may be clothed in different garments of the flesh.”\r\n\r\nI did not understand her, but, in some strange way, her words brought\r\nto my mind those that Natalie spoke at the last, and I answered:\r\n\r\n“Yva, when my wife lay dying she bade me seek her elsewhere, for\r\ncertainly I should find her. Doubtless she meant beyond the shores of\r\ndeath—or perhaps she also dreamed.”\r\n\r\nShe bent her head, looking at me very strangely.\r\n\r\n“Your wife, too, may have had the gift of dreams, Humphrey. As you\r\ndream and I dream, so mayhap she dreamed. Of dreams, then, let us say\r\nno more, since I think that they have served their purpose, and all\r\nthree of us understand.”\r\n\r\nThen I stretched out my arms, and next instant my head lay upon her\r\nperfumed breast. She lifted it and kissed me on the lips, saying:\r\n\r\n“With this kiss again I give myself to you. But oh! Humphrey, do not\r\nask too much of the god of my people, Fate,” and she looked me in the\r\neyes and sighed.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I asked, trembling.\r\n\r\n“Many, many things. Among them, that happiness is not for mortals, and\r\nremember that though my life began long ago, I am mortal as you are,\r\nand that in eternity time makes no difference.”\r\n\r\n“And if so, Yva, what then? Do we meet but to part?”\r\n\r\n“Who said it? Not I. Humphrey, I tell you this. Nor earth, nor heaven,\r\nnor hell have any bars through which love cannot burst its way towards\r\nreunion and completeness. Only there must be love, manifested in many\r\nshapes and at many times, but ever striving to its end, which is not of\r\nthe flesh. Aye, love that has lost itself, love scorned, love defeated,\r\nlove that seems false, love betrayed, love gone astray, love wandering\r\nthrough the worlds, love asleep and living in its sleep, love awake and\r\nyet sleeping; all love that has in it the germ of life. It matters not\r\nwhat form love takes. If it be true I tell you that it will win its\r\nway, and in the many that it has seemed to worship, still find the one,\r\nthough perchance not here.”\r\n\r\nAt her words a numb fear gripped my heart.\r\n\r\n“Not here? Then where?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Ask your dead wife, Humphrey. Ask the dumb stars. Ask the God you\r\nworship, for I cannot answer, save in one word—Somewhere! Man, be not\r\nafraid. Do you think that such as you and I can be lost in the aching\r\nabysms of space? I know but little, yet I tell you that we are its\r\nrulers. I tell you that we, too, are gods, if only we can aspire and\r\nbelieve. For the doubting and timid there is naught. For those who see\r\nwith the eyes of the soul and stretch out their hands to grasp there is\r\nall. Even Bastin will tell you this.”\r\n\r\n“But,” I said, “life is short. Those worlds are far away, and you are\r\nnear.”\r\n\r\nShe became wonderful, mysterious.\r\n\r\n“Near I am far,” she said; “and far I am near, if only this love of\r\nyours is strong enough to follow and to clasp. And, Humphrey, it needs\r\nstrength, for here I am afraid that it will bear little of such fruit\r\nas men desire to pluck.”\r\n\r\nAgain terror took hold of me, and I looked at her, for I did not know\r\nwhat to say or ask.\r\n\r\n“Listen,” she went on. “Already my father has offered me to you in\r\nmarriage, has he not, but at a price which you do not understand?\r\nBelieve me, it is one that you should never pay, since the rule of the\r\nworld can be too dearly bought by the slaughter of half the world. And\r\nif you would pay it, I cannot.”\r\n\r\n“But this is madness!” I exclaimed. “Your father has no powers over our\r\nearth.”\r\n\r\n“I would that I could think so, Humphrey. I tell you that he has powers\r\nand that it is his purpose to use them as he has done before. You, too,\r\nhe would use, and me.”\r\n\r\n“And, if so, Yva, we are lords of ourselves. Let us take each other\r\nwhile we may. Bastin is a priest.”\r\n\r\n“Lords of ourselves! Why, for ought I know, at this very moment Oro\r\nwatches us in his thought and laughs. Only in death, Humphrey, shall we\r\npass beyond his reach and become lords of ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“It is monstrous!” I cried. “There is the boat, let us fly away.”\r\n\r\n“What boat can bear us out of stretch of the arm of the old god of my\r\npeople, Fate, whereof Oro is the high priest? Nay, here we must wait\r\nour doom.”\r\n\r\n“Doom,” I said—“doom? What then is about to happen?”\r\n\r\n“A terrible thing, as I think, Humphrey. Or, rather, it will not\r\nhappen.”\r\n\r\n“Why not, if it must?”\r\n\r\n“Beloved,” she whispered, “Bastin has expounded to me a new faith\r\nwhereof the master-word is Sacrifice. The terrible thing will not\r\nhappen _because of sacrifice!_ Ask me no more.”\r\n\r\nShe mused a while, seated there in the moonlight upon the ancient altar\r\nof sacrifice, the veil she wore falling about her face and making her\r\nmysterious. Then she threw it back, showing her lovely eyes and\r\nglittering hair, and laughed.\r\n\r\n“We have still an earthly hour,” she said; “therefore let us forget the\r\nfar, dead past and the eternities to come and be joyful in that hour.\r\nNow throw your arms about me and I will tell you strange stories of\r\nlost days, and you shall look into my eyes and learn wisdom, and you\r\nshall kiss my lips and taste of bliss—you, who were and are and shall\r\nbe—you, the beloved of Yva from the beginning to the end of Time.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nThe Command\r\n\r\n\r\nI think that both Bastin and Bickley, by instinct as it were, knew what\r\nhad passed between Yva and myself and that she had promised herself to\r\nme. They showed this by the way in which they avoided any mention of\r\nher name. Also they began to talk of their own plans for the future as\r\nmatters in which I had no part. Thus I heard them discussing the\r\npossibility of escape from the island whereof suddenly they seemed to\r\nhave grown weary, and whether by any means two men (two, not three)\r\ncould manage to sail and steer the lifeboat that remained upon the\r\nwreck. In short, as in all such cases, the woman had come between; also\r\nthe pressure of a common loss caused them to forget their differences\r\nand to draw closer together. I who had succeeded where they both had\r\nfailed, was, they seemed to think, out of their lives, so much that our\r\nancient intimacy had ended.\r\n\r\nThis attitude hurt me, perhaps because in many respects the situation\r\nwas awkward. They had, it is true, taken their failures extremely well,\r\nstill the fact remained that both of them had fallen in love with the\r\nwonderful creature, woman and yet more than woman, who had bound\r\nherself to me. How then could we go on living together, I in\r\nprospective possession of the object that all had desired, and they\r\nwithout the pale?\r\n\r\nMoreover, they were jealous in another and quite a different fashion\r\nbecause they both loved me in their own ways and were convinced that I\r\nwho had hitherto loved them, henceforward should have no affection left\r\nto spare, since surely this Glittering Lady, this marvel of wisdom and\r\nphysical perfections would take it all. Of course they were in error,\r\nsince even if I could have been so base and selfish, this was no\r\nconduct that Yva would have wished or even suffered. Still that was\r\ntheir thought.\r\n\r\nMastering the situation I reflected a little while and then spoke\r\nstraight out to them.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” I said, “as I see that you have guessed, Yva and I are\r\naffianced to each other and love each other perfectly.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Arbuthnot,” said Bastin, “we saw that in your face, and in hers\r\nas she bade us good night before she went into the cave, and we\r\ncongratulate you and wish you every happiness.”\r\n\r\n“We wish you every happiness, old fellow,” chimed in Bickley. He paused\r\na while, then added, “But to be honest, I am not sure that I\r\ncongratulate you.”\r\n\r\n“Why not, Bickley?”\r\n\r\n“Not for the reason that you may suspect, Arbuthnot, I mean not because\r\nyou have won where we have lost, as it was only to be expected that you\r\nwould do, but on account of something totally different. I told you a\r\nwhile ago and repetition is useless and painful. I need only add\r\ntherefore that since then my conviction has strengthened and I am sure,\r\nsorry as I am to say it, that in this matter you must prepare for\r\ndisappointment and calamity. That woman, if woman she really is, will\r\nnever be the wife of mortal man. Now be angry with me if you like, or\r\nlaugh as you have the right to do, seeing that like Bastin and\r\nyourself, I also asked her to marry me, but something makes me speak\r\nwhat I believe to be the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Like Cassandra,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“Yes, like Cassandra who was not a popular person.” At first I was\r\ninclined to resent Bickley’s words—who would not have been in the\r\ncircumstances? Then of a sudden there rushed in upon my mind the\r\nconviction that he spoke the truth. In this world Yva was not for me or\r\nany man. Moreover she knew it, the knowledge peeped out of every word\r\nshe spoke in our passionate love scene by the lake. She was aware, and\r\nsubconsciously I was aware, that we were plighting our troth, not for\r\ntime but for eternity. With time we had little left to do; not for long\r\nwould she wear the ring I gave her on that holy night.\r\n\r\nEven Bastin, whose perceptions normally were not acute, felt that the\r\nsituation was strained and awkward and broke in with a curious air of\r\nforced satisfaction:\r\n\r\n“It’s uncommonly lucky for you, old boy, that you happen to have a\r\nclergyman in your party, as I shall be able to marry you in a\r\nrespectable fashion. Of course I can’t say that the Glittering Lady is\r\nas yet absolutely converted to our faith, but I am certain that she has\r\nabsorbed enough of its principles to justify me in uniting her in\r\nChristian wedlock.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “she has absorbed its principles; she told me as\r\nmuch herself. Sacrifice, for instance,” and as I spoke the word my eyes\r\nfilled with tears.\r\n\r\n“Sacrifice!” broke in Bickley with an angry snort, for he needed a vent\r\nto his mental disturbance. “Rubbish. Why should every religion demand\r\nsacrifice as savages do? By it alone they stand condemned.”\r\n\r\n“Because as I think, sacrifice is the law of life, at least of all life\r\nthat is worth the living,” I answered sadly enough. “Anyhow I believe\r\nyou are right, Bickley, and that Bastin will not be troubled to marry\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mean,” broke in Bastin with a horrified air, “that you\r\npropose to dispense—”\r\n\r\n“No, Bastin, I don’t mean that. What I mean is that it comes upon me\r\nthat something will prevent this marriage. Sacrifice, perhaps, though\r\nin what shape I do not know. And now good night. I am tired.”\r\n\r\nThat night in the chill dead hour before the dawn Oro came again. I\r\nwoke up to see him seated by my bed, majestic, and, as it seemed to me,\r\nlambent, though this may have been my imagination.\r\n\r\n“You take strange liberties with my daughter, Barbarian, or she takes\r\nstrange liberties with you, it does not matter which,” he said,\r\nregarding me with his calm and terrible eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why do you presume to call me Barbarian?” I asked, avoiding the main\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n“For this reason, Humphrey. All men are the same. They have the same\r\norgans, the same instincts, the same desires, which in essence are but\r\ntwo, food and rebirth that Nature commands; though it is true that\r\nmillions of years before I was born, as I have learned from the records\r\nof the Sons of Wisdom, it was said that they were half ape. Yet being\r\nthe same there is between them a whole sea of difference, since some\r\nhave knowledge and others none, or little. Those who have none or\r\nlittle, among whom you must be numbered, are Barbarians. Those who have\r\nmuch, among whom my daughter and I are the sole survivors, are the\r\nInstructed.”\r\n\r\n“There are nearly two thousand millions of living people in this\r\nworld,” I said, “and you name all of them Barbarians?”\r\n\r\n“All, Humphrey, excepting, of course, myself and my daughter who are\r\nnot known to be alive. You think that you have learned much, whereas in\r\ntruth you are most ignorant. The commonest of the outer nations, when I\r\ndestroyed them, knew more than your wisest know today.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken, Oro; since then we have learned something of the\r\nsoul.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he exclaimed, “that interests me and perhaps it is true. Also, if\r\ntrue it is very important, as I have told you before—or was it Bastin?\r\nIf a man has a soul, he lives, whereas even we Sons of Wisdom die, and\r\nin Death what is the use of Wisdom? Because you can believe, you have\r\nsouls and are therefore, perhaps, heirs to life, foolish and ignorant\r\nas you are today. Therefore I admit you and Bastin to be my equals,\r\nthough Bickley, who like myself believes nothing, is but a common\r\nchemist and doctor of disease.”\r\n\r\n“Then you bow to Faith, Oro?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I think that my god Fate also bows to Faith. Perhaps, indeed,\r\nFaith shapes Fate, not Fate, Faith. But whence comes that faith which\r\neven I with all my learning cannot command? Why is it denied to me and\r\ngiven to you and Bastin?”\r\n\r\n“Because as Bastin would tell you, it is a gift, though one that is\r\nnever granted to the proud and self-sufficient. Become humble as a\r\nchild, Oro, and perchance you too may acquire faith.”\r\n\r\n“And how shall I become humble?”\r\n\r\n“By putting away all dreams of power and its exercise, if such you\r\nhave, and in repentance walking quietly to the Gates of Death,” I\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n“For you, Humphrey, who have little or none of these things, that may\r\nbe easy. But for me who have much, if not all, it is otherwise. You ask\r\nme to abandon the certain for the uncertain, the known for the unknown,\r\nand from a half-god communing with the stars, to become an earthworm\r\ncrawling in mud and lifting blind eyes towards the darkness of\r\neverlasting night.”\r\n\r\n“A god who must die is no god, half or whole, Oro; the earthworm that\r\nlives on is greater than he.”\r\n\r\n“Mayhap. Yet while I endure I will be as a god, so that when night\r\ncomes, if come it must, I shall have played my part and left my mark\r\nupon this little world of ours. Have done!” he added with a burst of\r\nimpatience. “What will you of my daughter?”\r\n\r\n“What man has always willed of woman—herself, body and soul.”\r\n\r\n“Her soul perchance is yours, if she has one, but her body is mine to\r\ngive or withhold. Yet it can be bought at a price,” he added slowly.\r\n\r\n“So she told me, Oro.”\r\n\r\n“I can guess what she told you. Did I not watch you yonder by the lake\r\nwhen you gave her a ring graved with the signs of Life and\r\nEverlastingness? The question is, will you pay the price?”\r\n\r\n“Not so; the question is—what is the price?”\r\n\r\n“This; to enter my service and henceforth do my will—without debate or\r\ncavil.”\r\n\r\n“For what reward, Oro?”\r\n\r\n“Yva and the dominion of the earth while you shall live, neither more\r\nnor less.”\r\n\r\n“And what is your will?”\r\n\r\n“That you shall learn in due course. On the second night from this I\r\ncommand the three of you to wait upon me at sundown in the buried halls\r\nof Nyo. Till then you see no more of Yva, for I do not trust her. She,\r\ntoo, has powers, though as yet she does not use them, and perchance she\r\nwould forget her oaths, and following some new star of love, for a\r\nlittle while vanish with you out of my reach. Be in the sepulchre at\r\nthe hour of sundown on the second day from this, all three of you, if\r\nyou would continue to live upon the earth. Afterwards you shall learn\r\nmy will and make your choice between Yva with majesty and her loss with\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he was gone.\r\n\r\nNext morning I told the others what had passed, and we talked the\r\nmatter over. The trouble was, of course, that Bickley did not believe\r\nme. He had no faith in my alleged interviews with Oro, which he set\r\ndown to delusions of a semi-mesmeric character. This was not strange,\r\nsince it appeared that on the previous night he had watched the door of\r\nmy sleeping-place until dawn broke, which it did long after Oro had\r\ndeparted, and he had not seen him either come or go, although the moon\r\nwas shining brightly.\r\n\r\nWhen he told me this I could only answer that all the same he had been\r\nthere as, if he could speak, Tommy would have been able to certify. As\r\nit chanced the dog was sleeping with me and at the first sound of the\r\napproach of someone, woke up and growled. Then recognising Oro, he went\r\nto him, wagged his tail and curled himself up at his feet.\r\n\r\nBastin believed my story readily enough, saying that Oro was a peculiar\r\nperson who no doubt had ways of coming and going which we did not\r\nunderstand. His point was, however, that he did not in the least wish\r\nto visit Nyo any more. The wonders of its underground palaces and\r\ntemples had no charms for him. Also he did not think he could do any\r\ngood by going, since after “sucking him as dry as an orange” with\r\nreference to religious matters “that old vampire-bat Oro had just\r\nthrown him away like the rind,” and, he might add, “seemed no better\r\nfor the juice he had absorbed.”\r\n\r\n“I doubt,” continued Bastin, “whether St. Paul himself could have\r\nconverted Oro, even if he performed miracles before him. What is the\r\nuse of showing miracles to a man who could always work a bigger one\r\nhimself?”\r\n\r\nIn short, Bastin’s one idea, and Bickley’s also for the matter of that,\r\nwas to get away to the main island and thence escape by means of the\r\nboat, or in some other fashion.\r\n\r\nI pointed out that Oro had said we must obey at the peril of our lives;\r\nindeed that he had put it even more strongly, using words to the effect\r\nthat if we did not he would kill us.\r\n\r\n“I’d take the risk,” said Bickley, “since I believe that you dreamt it\r\nall, Arbuthnot. However, putting that aside, there is a natural reason\r\nwhy you should wish to go, and for my own part, so do I in a way. I\r\nwant to see what that old fellow has up his extremely long sleeve, if\r\nthere is anything there at all.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you ask me, Bickley,” I answered, “I believe it is the\r\ndestruction of half the earth, or some little matter of that sort.”\r\n\r\nAt this suggestion Bickley only snorted, but Bastin said cheerfully:\r\n\r\n“I dare say. He is bad enough even for that. But as I am quite\r\nconvinced that it will never be allowed, his intentions do not trouble\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nI remarked that he seemed to have carried them out once before.\r\n\r\n“Oh! you mean the Deluge. Well, no doubt there was a deluge, but I am\r\nsure that Oro had no more to do with it than you or I, as I think I\r\nhave said already. Anyhow it is impossible to leave you to descend into\r\nthat hole alone. I suggest, therefore, that we should go into the\r\nsepulchre at the time which you believe Oro appointed, and see what\r\nhappens. If you are not mistaken, the Glittering Lady will come there\r\nto fetch us, since it is quite certain that we cannot work the lift or\r\nwhatever it is, alone. If you are mistaken we can just go back to bed\r\nas usual.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s the best plan,” said Bickley, shortly, after which the\r\nconversation came to an end.\r\n\r\nAll that day and the next I watched and waited in vain for the coming\r\nof Yva, but no Yva appeared. I even went as far as the sepulchre, but\r\nit was as empty as were the two crystal coffins, and after waiting a\r\nwhile I returned. Although I did not say so to Bickley, to me it was\r\nevident that Oro, as he had said, was determined to cut off all\r\ncommunication between us.\r\n\r\nThe second day drew to its close. Our simple preparations were\r\ncomplete. They consisted mainly in making ready our hurricane lamps and\r\npacking up a little food, enough to keep us for three or four days if\r\nnecessary, together with some matches and a good supply of oil, since,\r\nas Bastin put it, he was determined not to be caught like the foolish\r\nvirgins in the parable.\r\n\r\n“You see,” he added, “one never knows when it might please that old\r\nwretch to turn off the incandescent gas or electric light, or whatever\r\nit is he uses to illumine his family catacombs, and then it would be\r\nawkward if we had no oil.”\r\n\r\n“For the matter of that he might steal our lamps,” suggested Bickley,\r\n“in which case we should be where Moses was when the light went out.”\r\n\r\n“I have considered that possibility,” answered Bastin, “and therefore,\r\nalthough it is a dangerous weapon to carry loaded, I am determined to\r\ntake my revolver. If necessary I shall consider myself quite justified\r\nin shooting him to save our lives and those of thousands of others.”\r\n\r\nAt this we both laughed; somehow the idea of Bastin trying to shoot Oro\r\nstruck us as intensely ludicrous. Yet that very thing was to happen.\r\n\r\nIt was a peculiarly beautiful sunset over the southern seas. To the\r\nwest the great flaming orb sank into the ocean, to the east appeared\r\nthe silver circle of the full moon. To my excited fancy they were like\r\nscales hanging from the hand of a materialised spirit of calm. Over the\r\nvolcano and the lake, over the island with its palm trees, over the\r\nseas beyond, this calm brooded. Save for a few travelling birds the sky\r\nwas empty; no cloud disturbed its peace; the world seemed steeped in\r\ninnocence and quiet.\r\n\r\nAll these things struck me, as I think they did the others, because by\r\nthe action of some simultaneous thought it came to our minds that very\r\nprobably we were looking on them for the last time. It is all very well\r\nto talk of the Unknown and the Infinite whereof we are assured we are\r\nthe heirs, but that does not make it any easier for us to part with the\r\nKnown and the Finite. The contemplation of the wonders of Eternity does\r\nnot conceal the advantages of actual and existent Time. In short there\r\nis no one of us, from a sainted archbishop down to a sinful suicide,\r\nwho does not regret the necessity of farewell to the pleasant light and\r\nthe kindly race of men wherewith we are acquainted.\r\n\r\nFor after all, who can be quite certain of the Beyond? It may be\r\nsplendid, but it will probably be strange, and from strangeness, after\r\na certain age, we shrink. We know that all things will be different\r\nthere; that our human relationships will be utterly changed, that\r\nperhaps sex which shapes so many of them, will vanish to be replaced by\r\nsomething unknown, that ambitions will lose their hold of us, and that,\r\nat the best, the mere loss of hopes and fears will leave us empty. So\r\nat least we think, who seek not variation but continuance, since the\r\nspirit must differ from the body and that thought alarms our\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nAt least some of us think so; others, like Bickley, write down the\r\nfuture as a black and endless night, which after all has its\r\nconsolations since, as has been wisely suggested, perhaps oblivion is\r\nbetter than any memories. Others again, like Bastin, would say of it\r\nwith the Frenchman, _plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose_. Yet\r\nothers, like Oro, consider it as a realm of possibilities, probably\r\nunpleasant and perhaps non-existent; just this and nothing more. Only\r\none thing is certain, that no creature which has life desires to leap\r\ninto the fire and from the dross of doubts, to resolve the gold—or the\r\nlead—of certainty.\r\n\r\n“It is time to be going,” said Bastin. “In these skies the sun seems to\r\ntumble down, not to set decently as it does in England, and if we wait\r\nany longer we shall be late for our appointment in the sepulchre. I am\r\nsorry because although I don’t often notice scenery, everything looks\r\nrather beautiful this evening. That star, for instance, I think it is\r\ncalled Venus.”\r\n\r\n“And therefore one that Arbuthnot should admire,” broke in Bickley,\r\nattempting to lighten matters with a joke. “But come on and let us be\r\nrid of this fool’s errand. Certainly the world is a lovely place after\r\nall, and for my part I hope that we haven’t seen the last of it,” he\r\nadded with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“So do I,” said Bastin, “though of course, Faith teaches us that there\r\nare much better ones beyond. It is no use bothering about what they are\r\nlike, but I hope that the road to them doesn’t run through the hole\r\nthat the old reprobate, Oro, calls Nyo.”\r\n\r\nA few minutes later we started, each of us carrying his share of the\r\nimpedimenta. I think that Tommy was the only really cheerful member of\r\nthe party, for he skipped about and barked, running backwards and\r\nforwards into the mouth of the cave, as though to hurry our movements.\r\n\r\n“Really,” said Bastin, “it is quite unholy to see an animal going on in\r\nthat way when it knows that it is about to descend into the bowels of\r\nthe earth. I suppose it must like them.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! no,” commented Bickley, “it only likes what is in them—like\r\nArbuthnot. Since that little beast came in contact with the Lady Yva,\r\nit has never been happy out of her company.”\r\n\r\n“I think that is so,” said Bastin. “At any rate I have noticed that it\r\nhas been moping for the last two days, as it always does when she is\r\nnot present. It even seems to like Oro who gives me the creeps, perhaps\r\nbecause he is her father. Dogs must be very charitable animals.”\r\n\r\nBy now we were in the cave marching past the wrecks of the half-buried\r\nflying-machines, which Bickley, as he remarked regretfully, had never\r\nfound time thoroughly to examine. Indeed, to do so would have needed\r\nmore digging than we could do without proper instruments, since the\r\nmachines were big and deeply entombed in dust.\r\n\r\nWe came to the sepulchre and entered.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Bickley, seating himself on the edge of one of the coffins\r\nand holding up his lamp to look about him, “this place seems fairly\r\nempty. No one is keeping the assignation, Arbuthnot, although the sun\r\nis well down.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the words Yva stood before us. Whence she came we did not\r\nsee, for all our backs were turned at the moment of her arrival. But\r\nthere she was, calm, beautiful, radiating light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nIn the Temple of Fate\r\n\r\n\r\nYva glanced at me, and in her eyes I read tenderness and solicitude,\r\nalso something of inquiry. It seemed to me as though she were wondering\r\nwhat I should do under circumstances that might, or would, arise, and\r\nin some secret fashion of which I was but half conscious, drawing an\r\nanswer from my soul. Then she turned, and, smiling in her dazzling way,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“So, Bickley, as usual, you did not believe? Because _you_ did not see\r\nhim, therefore the Lord Oro, my father, never spoke with Humphrey. As\r\nthough the Lord Oro could not pass you without your knowledge, or,\r\nperchance, send thoughts clothed in his own shape to work his errand.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know that I did not believe Arbuthnot’s story?” Bickley\r\nasked in a rather cross voice and avoiding the direct issue. “Do you\r\nalso send thoughts to work _your_ errands clothed in your own shape,\r\nLady Yva?”\r\n\r\n“Alas! not so, though perhaps I could if I might. It is very simple,\r\nBickley. Standing here, I heard you say that although the sun was well\r\ndown there was no one to meet you as Humphrey had expected, and from\r\nthose words and your voice I guessed the rest.”\r\n\r\n“Your knowledge of the English language is improving fast, Lady Yva.\r\nAlso, when I spoke, you were not here.”\r\n\r\n“At least I was very near, Bickley, and these walls are thinner than\r\nyou think,” she answered, contemplating what seemed to be solid rock\r\nwith eyes that were full of innocence. “Oh! friend,” she went on\r\nsuddenly, “I wonder what there is which will cause you to believe that\r\nyou do not know all; that there exist many things beyond the reach of\r\nyour learning and imagination? Well, in a day or two, perhaps, even you\r\nwill admit as much, and confess it to me—elsewhere,” and she sighed.\r\n\r\n“I am ready to confess now that much happens which I do not understand\r\nat present, because I have not the key to the trick,” he replied.\r\n\r\nYva shook her head at him and smiled again. Then she motioned to all of\r\nus to stand close to her, and, stooping, lifted Tommy in her arms. Next\r\nmoment that marvel happened which I have described already, and we were\r\nwhirling downwards through space, to find ourselves in a very little\r\ntime standing safe in the caves of Nyo, breathless with the swiftness\r\nof our descent. How and on what we descended neither I nor the others\r\never learned. It was and must remain one of the unexplained mysteries\r\nof our great experience.\r\n\r\n“Whither now, Yva?” I asked, staring about me at the radiant vastness.\r\n\r\n“The Lord Oro would speak with you, Humphrey. Follow. And I pray you\r\nall do not make him wrath, for his mood is not gentle.”\r\n\r\nSo once more we proceeded down the empty streets of that underground\r\nabode which, except that it was better illuminated, reminded me of the\r\nGreek conception of Hades. We came to the sacred fountain over which\r\nstood the guardian statue of Life, pouring from the cups she held the\r\nwaters of Good and Ill that mingled into one health-giving wine.\r\n\r\n“Drink, all of you,” she said; “for I think before the sun sets again\r\nupon the earth we shall need strength, every one of us.”\r\n\r\nSo we drank, and she drank herself, and once more felt the blood go\r\ndancing through our veins as though the draught had been some nectar of\r\nthe gods. Then, having extinguished the lanterns which we still\r\ncarried, for here they were needless, and we wished to save our oil, we\r\nfollowed her through the great doors into the vast hall of audience and\r\nadvanced up it between the endless, empty seats. At its head, on the\r\ndais beneath the arching shell, sat Oro on his throne. As before, he\r\nwore the jewelled cap and the gorgeous, flowing robes, while the table\r\nin front of him was still strewn with sheets of metal on which he wrote\r\nwith a pen, or stylus, that glittered like a diamond or his own fierce\r\neyes. Then he lifted his head and beckoned to us to ascend the dais.\r\n\r\n“You are here. It is well,” he said, which was all his greeting. Only\r\nwhen Tommy ran up to him he bent down and patted the dog’s head with\r\nhis long, thin hand, and, as he did so, his face softened. It was\r\nevident to me that Tommy was more welcome to him than were the rest of\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence while, one by one, he searched us with his\r\npiercing glance. It rested on me, the last of the three of us, and from\r\nme travelled to Yva.\r\n\r\n“I wonder why I have sent for you?” he said at length, with a mirthless\r\nlaugh. “I think it must be that I may convince Bickley, the sceptic,\r\nthat there are powers which he does not understand, but that I have the\r\nstrength to move. Also, perhaps, that your lives may be spared for my\r\nown purposes in that which is about to happen. Hearken! My labours are\r\nfinished; my calculations are complete,” and he pointed to the sheets\r\nof metal before him that were covered with cabalistic signs. “Tomorrow\r\nI am about to do what once before I did and to plunge half the world in\r\nthe deeps of ocean and lift again from the depths that which has been\r\nburied for a quarter of a million years.”\r\n\r\n“Which half?” asked Bickley.\r\n\r\n“That is my secret, Physician, and the answer to it lies written here\r\nin signs you cannot read. Certain countries will vanish, others will be\r\nspared. I say that it is my secret.”\r\n\r\n“Then, Oro, if you could do what you threaten, you would drown hundreds\r\nof millions of people.”\r\n\r\n“If I could do! If I could do!” he exclaimed, glaring at Bickley.\r\n“Well, tomorrow you shall see what I can do. Oh! why do I grow angry\r\nwith this fool? For the rest, yes, they must drown. What does it\r\nmatter? Their end will be swift; some few minutes of terror, that is\r\nall, and in one short century every one of them would have been dead.”\r\n\r\nAn expression of horror gathered on Bastin’s face.\r\n\r\n“Do you really mean to murder hundreds of millions of people?” he\r\nasked, in a thick, slow voice.\r\n\r\n“I have said that I intend to send them to that heaven or that hell of\r\nwhich you are so fond of talking, Preacher, somewhat more quickly than\r\notherwise they would have found their way thither. They have\r\ndisappointed me, they have failed; therefore, let them go and make room\r\nfor others who will succeed.”\r\n\r\n“Then you are a greater assassin than any that the world has bred, or\r\nthan all of them put together. There is nobody as bad, even in the Book\r\nof Revelation!” shouted Bastin, in a kind of fury. “Moreover, I am not\r\nlike Bickley. I know enough of you and your hellish powers to believe\r\nthat what you plan, that you can do.”\r\n\r\n“I believe it also,” sneered Oro. “But how comes it that the Great One\r\nwhom you worship does not prevent the deed, if He exists, and it be\r\nevil?”\r\n\r\n“He _will_ prevent it!” raved Bastin. “Even now He commands me to\r\nprevent it, and I obey!” Then, drawing the revolver from his pocket, he\r\npointed it at Oro’s breast, adding: “Swear not to commit this crime, or\r\nI will kill you!”\r\n\r\n“So the man of peace would become a man of blood,” mused Oro, “and kill\r\nthat _I_ may not kill for the good of the world? Why, what is the\r\nmatter with that toy of yours, Preacher?” and he pointed to the pistol.\r\n\r\nWell might he ask, for as he spoke the revolver flew out of Bastin’s\r\nhand. High into the air it flew, and as it went discharged itself, all\r\nthe six chambers of it, in rapid succession, while Bastin stood staring\r\nat his arm and hand which he seemed unable to withdraw.\r\n\r\n“Do you still threaten me with that outstretched hand, Preacher?”\r\nmocked Oro.\r\n\r\n“I can’t move it,” said Bastin; “it seems turned to stone.”\r\n\r\n“Be thankful that you also are not turned to stone. But, because your\r\ncourage pleases me, I will spare you, yes, and will advance you in my\r\nNew Kingdom. What shall you be? Controller of Religions, I think, since\r\nall the qualities that a high priest should have are yours—faith,\r\nfanaticism and folly.”\r\n\r\n“It is very strange,” said Bastin, “but all of a sudden my arm and hand\r\nare quite well again. I suppose it must have been ‘pins and needles’ or\r\nsomething of that sort which made me throw away the pistol and pull the\r\ntrigger when I didn’t mean to do so.”\r\n\r\nThen he went to fetch that article which had fallen beyond the dais,\r\nand quite forgot his intention of executing Oro in the interest of\r\ntesting its mechanism, which proved to be destroyed. To his proposed\r\nappointment he made no illusion. If he comprehended what was meant,\r\nwhich I doubt, he took it as a joke.\r\n\r\n“Hearken all of you,” said Oro, lifting his head suddenly, for while\r\nBastin recovered the revolver he had been brooding. “The great thing\r\nwhich I shall do tomorrow must be witnessed by you because thereby only\r\ncan you come to understand my powers. Also yonder where I bring it\r\nabout in the bowels of the earth, you will be safer than elsewhere,\r\nsince when and perhaps before it happens, the whole world will heave\r\nand shake and tremble, and I know not what may chance, even in these\r\ncaves. For this reason also, do not forget to bring the little hound\r\nwith you, since him least of all of you would I see come to harm,\r\nperhaps because once, hundreds of generations ago as you reckon time, I\r\nhad a dog very like to him. Your mother loved him much, Yva, and when\r\nshe died, this dog died also. He lies embalmed with her on her coffin\r\nyonder in the temple, and yesterday I went to look at both of them. The\r\nbeasts are wonderfully alike, which shows the everlastingness of\r\nblood.”\r\n\r\nHe paused a while, lost in thought, then continued: “After the deed is\r\ndone I’ll speak with you and you shall choose, Strangers, whether you\r\nwill die your own masters, or live on to serve me. Now there is one\r\nproblem that is left to me to solve—whether I can save a certain\r\nland—do not ask which it is, Humphrey, though I see the question in\r\nyour eyes—or must let it go with the rest. I only answer you that I\r\nwill do my best because you love it. So farewell for a while, and,\r\nPreacher, be advised by me and do not aim too high again.”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t matter where I aim,” answered Bastin sturdily, “or whether\r\nI hit or miss, since there is something much bigger than me waiting to\r\ndeal with you. The countries that you think you are going to destroy\r\nwill sleep quite as well tomorrow as they do tonight, Oro.”\r\n\r\n“Much better, I think, Preacher, since by then they will have left\r\nsorrow and pain and wickedness and war far behind them.”\r\n\r\n“Where are we to go?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The Lady Yva will show you,” he answered, waving his hand, and once\r\nmore bent over his endless calculations.\r\n\r\nYva beckoned to us and we turned and followed her down the hall. She\r\nled us to a street near the gateway of the temple and thence into one\r\nof the houses. There was a portico to it leading to a court out of\r\nwhich opened rooms somewhat in the Pompeian fashion. We did not enter\r\nthe rooms, for at the end of the court were a metal table and three\r\ncouches also of metal, on which were spread rich-looking rugs. Whence\r\nthese came I do not know and never asked, but I remember that they were\r\nvery beautiful and soft as velvet.\r\n\r\n“Here you may sleep,” she said, “if sleep you can, and eat of the food\r\nthat you have brought with you. Tomorrow early I will call you when it\r\nis time for us to start upon our journey into the bowels of the earth.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to go any deeper than we are,” said Bastin doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“I think that none of us want to go, Bastin,” she answered with a sigh.\r\n“Yet go we must. I pray of you, anger the Lord Oro no more on this or\r\nany other matter. In your folly you tried to kill him, and as it\r\nchanced he bore it well because he loves courage. But another time he\r\nmay strike back, and then, Bastin—”\r\n\r\n“I am not afraid of him,” he answered, “but I do not like tunnels.\r\nStill, perhaps it would be better to accompany you than to be left in\r\nthis place alone. Now I will unpack the food.”\r\n\r\nYva turned to go.\r\n\r\n“I must leave you,” she said, “since my father needs my help. The\r\nmatter has to do with the Force that he would let loose tomorrow, and\r\nits measurements; also with the preparation of the robes that we must\r\nwear lest it should harm us in its leap.”\r\n\r\nSomething in her eyes told me that she wished me to follow her, and I\r\ndid so. Outside the portico where we stood in the desolate, lighted\r\nstreet, she halted.\r\n\r\n“If you are not afraid,” she said, “meet me at midnight by the statue\r\nof Fate in the great temple, for I would speak with you, Humphrey,\r\nwhere, if anywhere, we may be alone.”\r\n\r\n“I will come, Yva.”\r\n\r\n“You know the road, and the gates are open, Humphrey.”\r\n\r\nThen she gave me her hand to kiss and glided away. I returned to the\r\nothers and we ate, somewhat sparingly, for we wished to save our food\r\nin case of need, and having drunk of the Life-water, were not hungry.\r\nAlso we talked a little, but by common consent avoided the subject of\r\nthe morrow and what it might bring forth.\r\n\r\nWe knew that terrible things were afoot, but lacking any knowledge of\r\nwhat these might be, thought it useless to discuss them. Indeed we were\r\ntoo depressed, so much so that even Bastin and Bickley ceased from\r\narguing. The latter was so overcome by the exhibition of Oro’s powers\r\nwhen he caused the pistol to leap into the air and discharge itself,\r\nthat he could not even pluck up courage to laugh at the failure of\r\nBastin’s efforts to do justice on the old Super-man, or rather to\r\nprevent him from attempting a colossal crime.\r\n\r\nAt length we lay down on the couches to rest, Bastin remarking that he\r\nwished he could turn off the light, also that he did not in the least\r\nregret having tried to kill Oro. Sleep seemed to come to the others\r\nquickly, but I could only doze, to wake up from time to time. Of this I\r\nwas not sorry, since whenever I dropped off dreams seemed to pursue me.\r\nFor the most part they were of my dead wife. She appeared to be trying\r\nto console me for some loss, but the strange thing was that sometimes\r\nshe spoke with her own voice and sometimes with Yva’s, and sometimes\r\nlooked at me with her own eyes and sometimes with those of Yva. I\r\nremember nothing else about these dreams, which were very confused.\r\n\r\nAfter one of them, the most vivid of all, I awoke and looked at my\r\nwatch. It was half-past eleven, almost time for me to be starting. The\r\nother two seemed to be fast asleep. Presently I rose and crept down the\r\ncourt without waking them. Outside the portico, which by the way was a\r\ncurious example of the survival of custom in architecture, since none\r\nwas needed in that weatherless place, I turned to the right and\r\nfollowed the wide street to the temple enclosure. Through the pillared\r\ncourts I went, my footsteps, although I walked as softly as I could,\r\nechoing loudly in that intense silence, through the great doors into\r\nthe utter solitude of the vast and perfect fane.\r\n\r\nWords can not tell the loneliness of that place. It flowed over me like\r\na sea and seemed to swallow up my being, so that even the wildest and\r\nmost dangerous beast would have been welcome as a companion. I was as\r\nterrified as a child that wakes to find itself deserted in the dark.\r\nAlso an uncanny sense of terrors to come oppressed me, till I could\r\nhave cried aloud if only to hear the sound of a mortal voice. Yonder\r\nwas the grim statue of Fate, the Oracle of the Kings of the Sons of\r\nWisdom, which was believed to bow its stony head in answer to their\r\nprayers. I ran to it, eager for its terrible shelter, for on either\r\nside of it were figures of human beings. Even their cold marble was\r\ncompany of a sort, though alas! over all frowned Fate.\r\n\r\nLet anyone imagine himself standing alone beneath the dome of St.\r\nPaul’s; in the centre of that cathedral brilliant with mysterious\r\nlight, and stretched all about it a London that had been dead and\r\nabsolutely unpeopled for tens of thousands of years. If he can do this\r\nhe will gather some idea of my physical state. Let him add to his\r\nmind-picture a knowledge that on the following day something was to\r\nhappen not unlike the end of the world, as prognosticated by the Book\r\nof Revelation and by most astronomers, and he will have some idea of my\r\nmental perturbations. Add to the mixture a most mystic yet very real\r\nlove affair and an assignation before that symbol of the cold fate\r\nwhich seems to sway the universes down to the tiniest detail of\r\nindividual lives, and he may begin to understand what I, Humphrey\r\nArbuthnot, experienced during my vigil in this sanctuary of a vanished\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nIt seemed long before Yva came, but at last she did come. I caught\r\nsight of her far away beyond the temple gate, flitting through the\r\nunholy brightness of the pillared courts like a white moth at night and\r\nseeming quite as small. She approached; now she was as a ghost, and\r\nthen drawing near, changed into a living, breathing, lovely woman. I\r\nopened my arms, and with something like a sob she sank into them and we\r\nkissed as mortals do.\r\n\r\n“I could not come more quickly,” she said. “The Lord Oro needed me, and\r\nthose calculations were long and difficult. Also twice he must visit\r\nthe place whither we shall go tomorrow, and that took time.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is close at hand?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Humphrey, be not foolish. Do you not remember, who have travelled with\r\nhim, that Oro can throw his soul afar and bring it back again laden\r\nwith knowledge, as the feet of a bee are laden with golden dust? Well,\r\nhe went and went again, and I must wait. And then the robes and\r\nshields; they must be prepared by his arts and mine. Oh! ask not what\r\nthey are, there is no time to tell, and it matters nothing. Some folk\r\nare wise and some are foolish, but all which matters is that within\r\nthem flows the blood of life and that life breeds love, and that love,\r\nas I believe, although Oro does not, breeds immortality. And if so,\r\nwhat is Time but as a grain of sand upon the shore?”\r\n\r\n“This, Yva; it is ours, who can count on nothing else.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Humphrey, if I thought that, no more wretched creature would\r\nbreathe tonight upon this great world.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I asked, growing fearful, more at her manner and\r\nher look than at her words.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, nothing, except that Time is so very short. A kiss, a touch,\r\na little light and a little darkness, and it is gone. Ask my father Oro\r\nwho has lived a thousand years and slept for tens of thousands, as I\r\nhave, and he will say the same. It is against Time that he fights; he\r\nwho, believing in nothing beyond, will inherit nothing, as Bastin says;\r\nhe to whom Time has brought nothing save a passing, blood-stained\r\ngreatness, and triumph ending in darkness and disaster, and hope that\r\nwill surely suffer hope’s eclipse, and power that must lay down its\r\ncoronet in dust.”\r\n\r\n“And what has it brought to you, Yva, beyond a fair body and a soul of\r\nstrength?”\r\n\r\n“It has brought a spirit, Humphrey. Between them the body and the soul\r\nhave bred a spirit, and in the fires of tribulation from that spirit\r\nhas been distilled the essence of eternal love. That is Time’s gift to\r\nme, and therefore, although still he rules me here, I mock at Fate,”\r\nand she waved her hand with a gesture of defiance at the stern-faced,\r\nsexless effigy which sat above us, the sword across its knees.\r\n\r\n“Look! Look!” she went on in a swelling voice of music, pointing to the\r\nstatues of the dotard and the beauteous woman. “They implore Fate, they\r\nworship Fate. _I_ do not implore, _I_ do not worship or ask a sign as\r\neven Oro does and as did his forefathers. _I_ rise above and triumph.\r\nAs Fate, the god of my people, sets his foot upon the sun, so I set my\r\nfoot upon Fate, and thence, like a swimmer from a rock, leap into the\r\nwaters of Immortality.”\r\n\r\nI looked at her whose presence, as happened from time to time, had\r\ngrown majestic beyond that of woman; I studied her deep eyes which were\r\nfull of lights, not of this world, and I grew afraid.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I asked. “Yva, you talk like one who has finished\r\nwith life.”\r\n\r\n“It passes,” she answered quickly. “Life passes like breath fading from\r\na mirror. So should all talk who breathe beneath the sun.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Yva, but if you went and left me still breathing on that mocking\r\nglass—”\r\n\r\n“If so, what of it? Will not your breath fade also and join mine where\r\nall vapours go? Or if it were yours that faded and mine that remained\r\nfor some few hours, is it not the same? I think, Humphrey, that already\r\nyou have seen a beloved breath melt from the glass of life,” she added,\r\nlooking at me earnestly.\r\n\r\nI bowed my head and answered:\r\n\r\n“Yes, and therefore I am ashamed.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! why should you be ashamed, Humphrey, who are not sure but that two\r\nbreaths may yet be one breath? How do you know that there is a\r\ndifference between them?”\r\n\r\n“You drive me mad, Yva. I cannot understand.”\r\n\r\n“Nor can I altogether, Humphrey. Why should I, seeing that I am no more\r\nthan woman, as you are no more than man? I would always have you\r\nremember, Humphrey, that I am no spirit or sorceress, but just a\r\nwoman—like her you lost.”\r\n\r\nI looked at her doubtfully and answered:\r\n\r\n“Women do not sleep for two hundred thousand years. Women do not take\r\ndream journeys to the stars. Women do not make the dead past live again\r\nbefore the watcher’s eyes. Their hair does not glimmer in the dusk nor\r\ndo their bodies gleam, nor have they such strength of soul or eyes so\r\nwonderful, or loveliness so great.”\r\n\r\nThese words appeared to distress her who, as it seemed to me, was above\r\nall things anxious to prove herself woman and no more.\r\n\r\n“All these qualities are nothing, Humphrey,” she cried. “As for the\r\nbeauty, such as it is, it comes to me with my blood, and with it the\r\nglitter of my hair which is the heritage of those who for generations\r\nhave drunk of the Life-water. My mother was lovelier than I, as was her\r\nmother, or so I have heard, since only the fairest were the wives of\r\nthe Kings of the Children of Wisdom. For the rest, such arts as I have\r\nspring not from magic, but from knowledge which your people will\r\nacquire in days to come, that is, if Oro spares them. Surely you above\r\nall should know that I am only woman,” she added very slowly and\r\nsearching my face with her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why, Yva? During the little while that we have been together I have\r\nseen much which makes me doubt. Even Bickley the sceptic doubts also.”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you, though I am not sure that you will believe me.” She\r\nglanced about her as though she were frightened lest someone should\r\noverhear her words or read her thoughts. Then she stretched out her\r\nhands and drawing my head towards her, put her lips to my ear and\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n“Because once you saw me _die_, as women often die—giving life for\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“I saw _you_ die?” I gasped.\r\n\r\nShe nodded, then continued to whisper in my ear, not in her own voice,\r\nbut another’s:\r\n\r\n“_Go where you seem called to go, far away. Oh! the wonderful place in\r\nwhich you will find me, not knowing that you have found me. Good-bye\r\nfor a little while; only for a little while, my own, my own!_”\r\n\r\nI knew the voice as I knew the words, and knowing, I think that I\r\nshould have fallen to the ground, had she not supported me with her\r\nstrong arms.\r\n\r\n“Who told you?” I stammered. “Was it Bickley or Bastin? They knew,\r\nthough neither of them heard those holy words.”\r\n\r\n“Not Bickley nor Bastin,” she answered, shaking her head, “no, nor you\r\nyourself, awake or sleeping, though once, by the lake yonder, you said\r\nto me that when a certain one lay dying, she bade you seek her\r\nelsewhere, for certainly you would find her. Humphrey, I cannot say who\r\ntold me those words because I do not know. _I think they are a memory,\r\nHumphrey!_”\r\n\r\n“That would mean that you, Yva, are the same as one who was—not called\r\nYva.”\r\n\r\n“The same as one who was called _Natalie_, Humphrey,” she replied in\r\nsolemn accents. “One whom you loved and whom you lost.”\r\n\r\n“Then you think that we live again upon this earth?”\r\n\r\n“Again and yet again, until the time comes for us to leave the earth\r\nfor ever. Of this, indeed, I am sure, for that knowledge was part of\r\nthe secret wisdom of my people.”\r\n\r\n“But you were not dead. You only slept.”\r\n\r\n“The sleep was a death-sleep which went by like a flash, yes, in an\r\ninstant, or so it seemed. Only the shell of the body remained preserved\r\nby mortal arts, and when the returning spirit and the light of life\r\nwere poured into it again, it awoke. But during this long death-sleep,\r\nthat spirit may have spoken through other lips and that light may have\r\nshone through other eyes, though of these I remember nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Then that dream of our visit to a certain star may be no dream?”\r\n\r\n“I think no dream, and you, too, have thought as much.”\r\n\r\n“In a way, yes, Yva. But I could not believe and turned from what I\r\nheld to be a phantasy.”\r\n\r\n“It was natural, Humphrey, that you should not believe. Hearken! In\r\nthis temple a while ago I showed you a picture of myself and of a man\r\nwho loved me and whom I loved, and of his death at Oro’s hands. Did you\r\nnote anything about that man?”\r\n\r\n“Bickley did,” I answered. “Was he right?”\r\n\r\n“I think that he was right, since otherwise I should not have loved\r\nyou, Humphrey.”\r\n\r\n“I remember nothing of that man, Yva.”\r\n\r\n“It is probable that you would not, since you and he are very far\r\napart, while between you and him flow wide seas of death, wherein are\r\nset islands of life; perhaps many of them. But I remember much who seem\r\nto have left him but a very little while ago.”\r\n\r\n“When you awoke in your coffin and threw your arms about me, what did\r\nyou think, Yva?”\r\n\r\n“I thought _you_ were that man, Humphrey.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence between us and in that silence the truth came home to\r\nme. Then there before the effigy of Fate and in the desolate, glowing\r\ntemple we plighted anew our troth made holy by a past that thus so\r\nwonderfully lived again.\r\n\r\nOf this consecrated hour I say no more. Let each picture it as he will.\r\nA glory as of heaven fell upon us and in it we dwelt a space.\r\n\r\n“Beloved,” she whispered at length in a voice that was choked as though\r\nwith tears, “if it chances that we should be separated again for a\r\nlittle while, you will not grieve over much?”\r\n\r\n“Knowing all I should try not to grieve, Yva, seeing that in truth we\r\nnever can be parted. But do you mean that I shall die?”\r\n\r\n“Being mortal either of us might seem to die, Humphrey,” and she bent\r\nher head as though to hide her face. “You know we go into dangers this\r\nday.”\r\n\r\n“Does Oro really purpose to destroy much of the world and has he in\r\ntruth the power, Yva?”\r\n\r\n“He does so purpose and most certainly he has the power, unless—unless\r\nsome other Power should stay his hand.”\r\n\r\n“What other power, Yva?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! perhaps that which you worship, that which is called Love. The\r\nlove of man may avert the massacre of men. I hope so with all my heart.\r\nHist! Oro comes. I feel, I know that he comes, though not in search of\r\nus who are very far from his thought tonight. Follow me. Swiftly.”\r\n\r\nShe sped across the temple to where a chapel opened out of it, which\r\nwas full of the statues of dead kings, for here was the entrance to\r\ntheir burial vault. We reached it and hid behind the base of one of\r\nthese statues. By standing to our full height, without being seen we\r\nstill could see between the feet of the statue that stood upon a\r\npedestal.\r\n\r\nThen Oro came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nThe Chariot of the Pit\r\n\r\n\r\nOro came and of necessity alone. Yet there was that in his air as he\r\nadvanced into the temple, which suggested a monarch surrounded by the\r\npomp and panoply of a great court. He marched, his head held high, as\r\nthough heralds and pursuivants went in front of him, as though nobles\r\nsurrounded him and guards or regiments followed after him. Let it be\r\nadmitted that he was a great figure in his gorgeous robes, with his\r\nlong white beard, his hawk-like features, his tall shape and his\r\nglittering eyes, which even at that distance I could see. Indeed once\r\nor twice I thought that he glanced out of the corners of them towards\r\nthe chapel where we were hid. But this I think was fancy. For as Yva\r\nsaid, his thoughts were set elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHe reached the statue of Fate and stood for a while contemplating it\r\nand the suppliant figures on either side, as though he were waiting for\r\nhis invisible court to arrange itself. Then he doffed his jewelled cap\r\nto the effigy, and knelt before it. Yes, Oro the Ancient, the\r\nSuper-man, the God, as the early peoples of the earth fancied such a\r\nbeing, namely, one full of wrath, revenge, jealousy, caprice and power,\r\nknelt in supplication to this image of stone which he believed to be\r\nthe home of a spirit, thereby showing himself to be after all not so\r\nfar removed from the savages whose idol Bastin had destroyed. More, in\r\na clear and resonant voice which reached us even across that great\r\nspace, he put up his prayer. It ran something as follows, for although\r\nI did not understand the language in which he spoke Yva translated it\r\nto me in a whisper:\r\n\r\n“God of the Sons of Wisdom, God of the whole earth, only God to whom\r\nmust bow every other Power and Dominion, to thee I, Oro the Great King,\r\nmake prayer and offer sacrifice. Twenty times ten thousand years and\r\nmore have gone by since I, Oro, visited this, thy temple and knelt\r\nbefore this, thy living effigy, yet thou, ruler of the world, dost\r\nremember the prayer I made and the sacrifice I offered. The prayer was\r\nfor triumph over my enemies and the sacrifice a promise of the lives of\r\nhalf of those who in that day dwelt upon the earth. Thou heardest the\r\nprayer, thou didst bow thy head and accept the sacrifice. Yea, the\r\nprayer was granted and the sacrifice was made, and in it were counted\r\nthe number of my foes.\r\n\r\n“Then I slept. Through countless generations I slept on and at my side\r\nwas the one child of my body that was left to me. What chanced to my\r\nspirit and to hers during that sleep, thou knowest alone, but doubtless\r\nthey went forth to work thy ends.\r\n\r\n“At the appointed time which thou didst decree, I awoke again and found\r\nin my house strangers from another land. In the company of one of those\r\nwhose spirit I drew forth, I visited the peoples of the new earth, and\r\nfound them even baser and more evil than those whom I had known.\r\nTherefore, since they cannot be bettered. I purpose to destroy them\r\nalso, and on their wreck to rebuild a glorious empire, such as was that\r\nof the Sons of Wisdom at its prime.\r\n\r\n“A sign! O Fate, ruler of the world, give me a sign that my desire\r\nshall be fulfilled.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, stretching out his arms and staring upwards. While he waited\r\nI felt the solid rock on which I stood quiver and sway beneath my feet\r\nso that Yva and I clung to each other lest we should fall. This chanced\r\nalso. The shock of the earth tremor, for such without doubt it was,\r\nthrew down the figures of the ancient man and the lovely woman which\r\nknelt as though making prayers to Fate, and shook the marble sword from\r\noff its knees. As it fell Oro caught it by the hilt, and, rising, waved\r\nit in triumph.\r\n\r\n“I thank thee, God of my people from the beginning,” he cried. “Thou\r\nhast given to me, thy last servant, thine own sword and I will use it\r\nwell. For these worshippers of thine who have fallen, thou shalt have\r\nothers, yes, all those who dwell in the new world that is to be. My\r\ndaughter and the man whom she has chosen to be the father of the kings\r\nof the earth, and with him his companions, shall be the first of the\r\nhundreds of millions that are to follow, for they shall kiss thy feet\r\nor perish. Thou shalt set thy foot upon the necks of all other gods;\r\nthou shalt rule and thou alone, and, as of old, Oro be thy minister.”\r\n\r\nStill holding the sword, he flung himself down as though in an ecstasy,\r\nand was silent.\r\n\r\n“I read the omen otherwise,” whispered Yva. “The worshippers of Fate\r\nare overthrown. His sword of power is fallen, but not into the hands\r\nthat clasped it, and he totters on his throne. A greater God asserts\r\ndominion of the world and this Fate is but his instrument.”\r\n\r\nOro rose again.\r\n\r\n“One prayer more,” he cried. “Give me life, long life, that I may\r\nexecute thy decrees. By word or gesture show me a sign that I shall be\r\nsatisfied with life, a year for every year that I have lived, or\r\ntwain!”\r\n\r\nHe waited, staring about him, but no token came; the idol did not speak\r\nor bow its head, as Yva had told me it was wont to do in sign of\r\naccepted prayer, how, she knew not. Only I thought I heard the echo of\r\nOro’s cries run in a whisper of mockery round the soaring dome.\r\n\r\nOnce more Oro flung himself upon his knees and began to pray in a\r\nveritable agony.\r\n\r\n“God of my forefathers, God of my lost people, I will hide naught from\r\nthee,” he said. “I who fear nothing else, fear death. The priest-fool\r\nyonder with his new faith, has spoken blundering words of judgment and\r\ndamnation which, though I do not believe them, yet stick in my heart\r\nlike arrows. I will stamp out his faith, and with this ancient sword of\r\nthine drive back the new gods into the darkness whence they came. Yet\r\nwhat if some water of Truth flows through the channel of his leaden\r\nlips, and what if because I have ruled and will rule as thou didst\r\ndecree, therefore, in some dim place of souls, I must bear these\r\nburdens of terror and of doom which I have bound upon the backs of\r\nothers! Nay, it cannot be, for what power is there in all the universe\r\nthat dares to make a slave of Oro and to afflict him with stripes?\r\n\r\n“Yet this can be and mayhap will be, that presently I lose my path in\r\nthe ways of everlasting darkness, and become strengthless and forgotten\r\nas are those who went before me, while my crown of Power shines on\r\nyounger brows. Alas! I grow old, since æons of sleep have not renewed\r\nmy strength. My time is short and yet I would not die as mortals must.\r\nOh! God of my people, whom I have served so well, save me from the\r\ndeath I dread. For I would not die. Give me a sign; give me the\r\nancient, sacred sign!”\r\n\r\nSo he spoke, lifting his proud and splendid head and watching the\r\nstatue with wide, expectant eyes.\r\n\r\n“Thou dost not answer,” he cried again. “Wouldst thou desert me, Fate?\r\nThen beware lest I set up some new god against thee and hurl thee from\r\nthine immemorial throne. While I live I still have powers, I who am the\r\nlast of thy worshippers, since it seems that my daughter turns her back\r\non thee. I will get me to the sepulchre of the kings and take counsel\r\nwith the dust of that wizard who first taught me wisdom. Even from the\r\ndepths of death he must come to my call clad in a mockery of life, and\r\ncomfort me. A little while yet I will wait, and if thou answer not,\r\nthen Fate, soon I’ll tear the sceptre from thy hand, and thou shalt\r\njoin the company of dead gods.” And throwing aside the sword, again Oro\r\nlaid down his head upon the ground and stretched out his arms in the\r\nlast abasement of supplication.\r\n\r\n“Come,” whispered Yva, “while there is yet time. Presently he will seek\r\nthis place to descend to the sepulchre, and if he learns that we have\r\nread his heart and know him for a coward deserted of his outworn god,\r\nsurely he will blot us out. Come, and be swift and silent.”\r\n\r\nWe crept out of the chapel, Yva leading, and along the circle of the\r\ngreat dome till we reached the gates. Here I glanced back and perceived\r\nthat Oro, looking unutterably small in that vastness, looking like a\r\ndead man, still lay outstretched before the stern-faced, unanswering\r\nEffigy which, with all his wisdom, he believed to be living and divine.\r\nPerhaps once it was, but if so its star had set for ever, like those of\r\nAmon, Jupiter and Baal, and he was its last worshipper.\r\n\r\nNow we were safe, but still we sped on till we reached the portico of\r\nour sleeping place. Then Yva turned and spoke.\r\n\r\n“It is horrible,” she said, “and my soul sickens. Oh, I thank the\r\nStrength which made it that I have no desire to rule the earth, and,\r\nbeing innocent of death, do not fear to die and cross his threshold.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is horrible,” I answered. “Yet all men fear death.”\r\n\r\n“Not when they have found love, Humphrey, for that I think is his true\r\nname, and, with it written on his brow, he stands upon the neck of Fate\r\nwho is still my father’s god.”\r\n\r\n“Then he is not yours, Yva?”\r\n\r\n“Nay. Once it was so, but now I reject him; he is no longer mine. As\r\nOro threatens, and perchance dare do in his rage, I have broken his\r\nchain, though in another fashion. Ask me no more; perhaps one day you\r\nwill learn the path I trod to freedom.”\r\n\r\nThen before I could speak, she went off:\r\n\r\n“Rest now, for within a few hours I must come to lead you and your\r\ncompanions to a terrible place. Yet whatever you may see or hear, be\r\nnot afraid, Humphrey, for I think that Oro’s god has no power over you,\r\nstrong though he was, and that Oro’s plans will fail, while I, who too\r\nhave knowledge, shall find strength to save the world.”\r\n\r\nThen of a sudden, once again she grew splendid, almost divine; no more\r\na woman but as it were an angel. Some fire of pure purpose seemed to\r\nburn up in her and to shine out of her eyes. Yet she said little. Only\r\nthis indeed:\r\n\r\n“To everyone, I think, there comes the moment of opportunity when\r\nchoice must be made between what is great and what is small, between\r\nself and its desires and the good of other wanderers in the way. This\r\nday that moment may draw near to you or me, and if so, surely we shall\r\ngreet it well. Such is Bastin’s lesson, which I have striven to learn.”\r\n\r\nThen she flung her arms about me and kissed me on the brow as a mother\r\nmight, and was gone.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, perhaps because of my mental exhaustion, for what I\r\nhad passed through seemed to overwhelm me so that I could no longer so\r\nmuch as think with clearness, even after all that I have described I\r\nslept like a child and awoke refreshed and well.\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch to find that it was now eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning in this horrible place where there was neither morn, nor noon,\r\nnor night, but only an eternal brightness that came I knew not whence,\r\nand never learned.\r\n\r\nI found that I was alone, since Bickley and Bastin had gone to fill our\r\nbottles with the Life-water. Presently they returned and we ate a\r\nlittle; with that water to drink one did not need much food. It was a\r\nsomewhat silent meal, for our circumstances were a check on talk;\r\nmoreover, I thought that the others looked at me rather oddly. Perhaps\r\nthey guessed something of my midnight visit to the temple, but if so\r\nthey thought it wisest to say nothing. Nor did I enlighten them.\r\n\r\nShortly after we had finished Yva appeared. She was wonderfully quiet\r\nand gentle in her manner, calm also, and greeted all of us with much\r\nsweetness. Of our experiences during the night she said no word to me,\r\neven when we were alone. One difference I noticed about her, however;\r\nthat she was clothed in garments such as I had never seen her wear\r\nbefore. They were close fitting, save for a flowing cape, and made of\r\nsome grey material, not unlike a coarse homespun or even asbestos\r\ncloth. Still they became her very well, and when I remarked upon them,\r\nall she answered was that part of our road would be rough. Even her\r\nfeet were shod with high buskins of this grey stuff.\r\n\r\nPresently she touched Bastin on the shoulder and said that she would\r\nspeak with him apart. They went together into one of the chambers of\r\nthat dwelling and there remained for perhaps the half of an hour. It\r\nwas towards the end of this time that in the intense silence I heard a\r\ncrash from the direction of the temple, as though something heavy had\r\nfallen to the rocky floor. Bickley also heard this sound. When the two\r\nreappeared I noticed that though still quite calm, Yva looked radiant,\r\nand, if I may say so, even more human and womanly than I had ever seen\r\nher, while Bastin also seemed very happy.\r\n\r\n“One has strange experiences in life, yes, very strange,” he remarked,\r\napparently addressing the air, which left me wondering to what\r\nparticular experience he might refer. Well, I thought that I could\r\nguess.\r\n\r\n“Friends,” said Yva, “it is time for us to be going and I am your\r\nguide. You will meet the Lord Oro at the end of your journey. I pray\r\nyou to bring those lamps of yours with you, since all the road is not\r\nlightened like this place.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to ask,” said Bickley, “whither we go and for what\r\nobject, points on which up to the present we have had no definite\r\ninformation.”\r\n\r\n“We go, friend Bickley, deep into the bowels of the world, far deeper,\r\nI think, than any mortal men have gone hitherto, that is, of your\r\nrace.”\r\n\r\n“Then we shall perish of heat,” said Bickley, “for with every thousand\r\nfeet the temperature rises many degrees.”\r\n\r\n“Not so. You will pass through a zone of heat, but so swiftly that if\r\nyou hold your breath you will not suffer overmuch. Then you will come\r\nto a place where a great draught blows which will keep you cool, and\r\nthence travel on to the end.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but to what end, Lady Yva?”\r\n\r\n“That you will see for yourselves, and with it other wondrous things.”\r\n\r\nHere some new idea seemed to strike her, and after a little hesitation\r\nshe added:\r\n\r\n“Yet why should you go? Oro has commanded it, it is true, but I think\r\nthat at the last he will forget. It must be decided swiftly. There is\r\nyet time. I can place you in safety in the sepulchre of Sleep where you\r\nfound us. Thence cross to the main island and sail away quickly in your\r\nboat out into the great sea, where I believe you will find succour.\r\nKnow that after disobeying him, you must meet Oro no more lest it\r\nshould be the worse for you. If that be your will, let us start. What\r\nsay you?”\r\n\r\nShe looked at me.\r\n\r\n“I say, Yva, that I am willing to go if you come with us. Not\r\notherwise.”\r\n\r\n“I say,” said Bickley, “that I want to see all this supernatural\r\nrubbish thoroughly exploded, and that therefore I should prefer to go\r\non with the business.”\r\n\r\n“And I say,” said Bastin, “that my most earnest desire is to be clear\r\nof the whole thing, which wearies and perplexes me more than I can\r\ntell. Only I am not going to run away, unless you think it desirable to\r\ndo so too, Lady Yva. I want you to understand that I am not in the\r\nleast afraid of the Lord Oro, and do not for one moment believe that he\r\nwill be allowed to bring about disaster to the world, as I understand\r\nis his wicked object. Therefore on the whole I am indifferent and quite\r\nprepared to accept any decision at which the rest of you may arrive.”\r\n\r\n“Be it understood,” said Yva with a little smile when Bastin had\r\nfinished his sermonette, “that I must join my father in the bowels of\r\nthe earth for a reason which will be made plain afterwards. Therefore,\r\nif you go we part, as I think to meet no more. Still my advice is that\r\nyou should go.”[1]\r\n\r\n [1] It is fortunate that we did not accept Yva’s offer. Had we done so\r\n we should have found ourselves shut in, and perished, as shall be\r\n told.—H. A.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this our only answer was to attend to the lighting of our lamps and\r\nthe disposal of our small impedimenta, such as our tins of oil and\r\nwater bottles. Yva noted this and laughed outright.\r\n\r\n“Courage did not die with the Sons of Wisdom,” she said.\r\n\r\nThen we set out, Yva walking ahead of us and Tommy frisking at her\r\nside.\r\n\r\nOur road led us through the temple. As we passed the great gates I\r\nstarted, for there, in the centre of that glorious building, I\r\nperceived a change. The statue of Fate was no more! It lay broken upon\r\nthe pavement among those fragments of its two worshippers which I had\r\nseen shaken down some hours before.\r\n\r\n“What does this mean?” I whispered to Yva. “I have felt no other\r\nearthquake.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know,” she answered, “or if I know I may not say. Yet learn\r\nthat no god can live on without a single worshipper, and, in a fashion,\r\nthat idol was alive, though this you will not believe.”\r\n\r\n“How very remarkable,” said Bastin, contemplating the ruin. “If I were\r\nsuperstitious, which I am not, I should say that this occurrence was an\r\nomen indicating the final fall of a false god. At any rate it is dead\r\nnow, and I wonder what caused it?”\r\n\r\n“I felt an earth tremor last night,” said Bickley, “though it is odd\r\nthat it should only have affected this particular statue. A thousand\r\npities, for it was a wonderful work of art.”\r\n\r\nThen I remembered and reminded Bickley of the crash which we had heard\r\nwhile Yva and Bastin were absent on some secret business in the\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nWalking the length of the great church, if so it could be called, we\r\ncame to an apse at the head of it where, had it been Christian, the\r\naltar would have stood. In this apse was a little open door through\r\nwhich we passed. Beyond it lay a space of rough rock that looked as\r\nthough it had been partially prepared for the erection of buildings and\r\nthen abandoned. All this space was lighted, however, like the rest of\r\nthe City of Nyo, and in the same mysterious way. Led by Yva, we\r\nthreaded our path between the rough stones, following a steep downward\r\nslope. Thus we walked for perhaps half a mile, till at length we came\r\nto the mouth of a huge pit that must, I imagine, have lain quite a\r\nthousand feet below the level of the temple.\r\n\r\nI looked over the edge of this pit and shrank back terrified. It seemed\r\nto be bottomless. Moreover, a great wind rushed up it with a roaring\r\nsound like to that of an angry sea. Or rather there were two winds,\r\nperhaps draughts would be a better term, if I may apply it to an air\r\nmovement of so fierce and terrible a nature. One of these rushed up the\r\npit, and one rushed down. Or it may have been that the up rush\r\nalternated with the down rush. Really it is impossible to say.\r\n\r\n“What is this place?” I asked, clinging to the others and shrinking\r\nback in alarm from its sheer edge and bottomless depth, for that this\r\nwas enormous we could see by the shaft of light which flowed downwards\r\nfarther than the eye could follow.\r\n\r\n“It is a vent up and down which air passes from and to the central\r\nhollows of the earth,” Yva answered. “Doubtless in the beginning\r\nthrough it travelled that mighty force which blew out these caves in\r\nthe heated rocks, as the craftsman blows out glass.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said Bastin. “Just like one blows out a bubble on a\r\npipe, only on a larger scale. Well, it is very interesting, but I have\r\nseen enough of it. Also I am afraid of being blown away.”\r\n\r\n“I fear that you must see more,” answered Yva with a smile, “since we\r\nare about to descend this pit.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that we are to go down that hole, and if so, how? I don’t\r\nsee any lift, or moving staircase, or anything of that sort.”\r\n\r\n“Easily and safely enough, Bastin. See.”\r\n\r\nAs she spoke a great flat rock of the size of a small room appeared,\r\nborne upwards, as I suppose, by the terrific draught which roared past\r\nus on its upward course. When it reached the lip of the shaft, it hung\r\na little while, then moved across and began to descend with such\r\nincredible swiftness that in a few seconds it had vanished from view.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Bastin, with his eyes almost starting out of his head,\r\n“that’s the lift, is it? Well, I tell you at once I don’t like the look\r\nof the thing. It gives me the creeps. Suppose it tilted.”\r\n\r\n“It does not tilt,” answered Yva, still smiling. “I tell you, Bastin,\r\nthat there is naught to fear. Only yesterday, I rode this rock and\r\nreturned unharmed.”\r\n\r\n“That is all very well, Lady Yva, but you may know how to balance it;\r\nalso when to get on and off.”\r\n\r\n“If you are afraid, Bastin, remain here until your companions return.\r\nThey, I think, will make the journey.”\r\n\r\nBickley and I intimated that we would, though to tell the truth, if\r\nless frank we were quite as alarmed as Bastin.\r\n\r\n“No, I’ll come too. I suppose one may as well die this way as any\r\nother, and if anything were to happen to them and I were left alone, it\r\nwould be worse still.”\r\n\r\n“Then be prepared,” said Yva, “for presently this air-chariot of ours\r\nwill return. When it appears and hangs upon the edge, step on to it and\r\nthrow yourselves upon your faces and all will be well. At the foot of\r\nthe shaft the motion lessens till it almost stops, and it is easy to\r\nspring, or even crawl to the firm earth.”\r\n\r\nThen she stooped down and lifted Tommy who was sniffing suspiciously at\r\nthe edge of the pit, his long ears blown straight above his head,\r\nholding him beneath her left arm and under her cloak, that he might not\r\nsee and be frightened.\r\n\r\nWe waited a while in silence, perhaps for five or six minutes, among\r\nthe most disagreeable, I think, that I ever passed. Then far down in\r\nthe brightness below appeared a black speck that seemed to grow in size\r\nas it rushed upwards.\r\n\r\n“It comes,” said Yva. “Prepare and do as I do. Do not spring, or run,\r\nlest you should go too far. Step gently on to the rock and to its\r\ncentre, and there lie down. Trust in me, all of you.”\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing else to do,” groaned Bastin.\r\n\r\nThe great stone appeared and, as before, hung at the edge of the pit.\r\nYva stepped on to it quietly, as she did so, catching hold of my wrist\r\nwith her disengaged hand. I followed her feeling very sick, and\r\npromptly sat down. Then came Bickley with the air of the virtuous hero\r\nof a romance walking a pirate’s plank, and also sat down. Only Bastin\r\nhesitated until the stone began to move away. Then with an ejaculation\r\nof “Here goes!” he jumped over the intervening crack of space and\r\nlanded in the middle of us like a sack of coal. Had I not been seated\r\nreally I think he would have knocked me off the rock. As it was, with\r\none hand he gripped me by the beard and with the other grasped Yva’s\r\nrobe, of neither of which would he leave go for quite a long time,\r\nalthough we forced him on to his face. The lantern which he held flew\r\nfrom his grasp and descended the shaft on its own account.\r\n\r\n“You silly fool!” exclaimed Bickley whose perturbation showed itself in\r\nanger. “There goes one of our lamps.”\r\n\r\n“Hang the lamp!” muttered the prostrate Bastin. “We shan’t want it in\r\nHeaven, or the other place either.”\r\n\r\nNow the stone which had quivered a little beneath the impact of Bastin,\r\nsteadied itself again and with a slow and majestic movement sailed to\r\nthe other side of the gulf. There it felt the force of gravity, or\r\nperhaps the weight of the returning air pressed on it, which I do not\r\nknow. At any rate it began to fall, slowly at first, then more swiftly,\r\nand afterwards at an incredible pace, so that in a few seconds the\r\nmouth of the pit above us grew small and presently vanished quite away.\r\nI looked up at Yva who was standing composedly in the midst of our\r\nprostrate shapes. She bent down and called in my ear:\r\n\r\n“All is well. The heat begins, but it will not endure for long.”\r\n\r\nI nodded and glanced over the edge of the stone at Bastin’s lantern\r\nwhich was sailing alongside of us, till presently we passed it. Bastin\r\nhad lit it before we started, I think in a moment of aberration, and it\r\nburned for quite a long while, showing like a star when the shaft grew\r\ndarker as it did by degrees, a circumstance that testifies to the\r\nexcellence of the make, which is one advertised not to go out in any\r\nwind. Not that we felt wind, or even draught, perhaps because we were\r\ntravelling with it.\r\n\r\nThen we entered the heat zone. About this there was no doubt, for the\r\nperspiration burst out all over me and the burning air scorched my\r\nlungs. Also Tommy thrust his head from beneath the cloak with his\r\ntongue hanging out and his mouth wide open.\r\n\r\n“Hold your breaths!” cried Yva, and we obeyed until we nearly burst. At\r\nleast I did, but what happened to the others I do not know.\r\n\r\nFortunately it was soon over and the air began to grow cool again. By\r\nnow we had travelled an enormous distance, it seemed to be miles on\r\nmiles, and I noticed that our terrific speed was slackening, also that\r\nthe shaft grew more narrow, till at length there were only a few feet\r\nbetween the edge of the stone and its walls. The result of this, or so\r\nI supposed, was that the compressed air acted as a buffer, lessening\r\nour momentum, till at length the huge stone moved but very slowly.\r\n\r\n“Be ready to follow me,” cried Yva again, and we rose to our feet, that\r\nis, Bickley and I did, but poor Bastin was semi-comatose. The stone\r\nstopped and Yva sprang from it to a rock platform level with which it\r\nlay. We followed, dragging Bastin between us. As we did so something\r\nhit me gently on the head. It was Bastin’s lamp, which I seized.\r\n\r\n“We are safe. Sit down and rest,” said Yva, leading us a few paces\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWe obeyed and presently by the dim light saw the stone begin to stir\r\nagain, this time upwards. In another twenty seconds it was away on its\r\nnever-ending journey.\r\n\r\n“Does it always go on like that?” said Bastin, sitting up and staring\r\nafter it.\r\n\r\n“Tens of thousands of years ago it was journeying thus, and tens of\r\nthousands of years hence it will still be journeying, or so I think,”\r\nshe replied. “Why not, since the strength of the draught never changes\r\nand there is nothing to wear it except the air?”\r\n\r\nSomehow the vision of this huge stone, first loosed and set in motion\r\nby heaven knows what agency, travelling from aeon to aeon up and down\r\nthat shaft in obedience to some law I did not understand, impressed my\r\nimagination like a nightmare. Indeed I often dream of it to this day.\r\n\r\nI looked about me. We were in some cavernous place that could be but\r\ndimly seen, for here the light that flowed down the shaft from the\r\nupper caves where it was mysteriously created, scarcely shone, and\r\noften indeed was entirely cut off, when the ever-journeying stone was\r\nin the narrowest parts of the passage. I could see, however, that this\r\ncavern stretched away both to right and left of us, while I felt that\r\nfrom the left, as we sat facing the shaft, there drew down a strong\r\nblast of fresh air which suggested that somewhere, however far away, it\r\nmust open on to the upper world. For the rest its bottom and walls\r\nseemed to be smooth as though they had been planed in the past ages by\r\nthe action of cosmic forces. Bickley noticed this the first and pointed\r\nit out to me. We had little time to observe, however, for presently Yva\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“If you are rested, friends, I pray you light those lamps of yours,\r\nsince we must walk a while in darkness.”\r\n\r\nWe did and started, still travelling downhill. Yva walked ahead with me\r\nand Tommy who seemed somewhat depressed and clung close to our heels.\r\nThe other two followed, arguing strenuously about I know not what. It\r\nwas their way of working off irritation and alarms.\r\n\r\nI asked Yva what was about to happen, for a great fear oppressed me.\r\n\r\n“I am not sure, Beloved,” she answered in a sweet and gentle voice,\r\n“who do not know all Oro’s secrets, but as I think, great things. We\r\nare now deep in the bowels of the world, and presently, perhaps, you\r\nwill see some of its mighty forces whereof your ignorant races have no\r\nknowledge, doing their everlasting work.”\r\n\r\n“Then how is it that we can breathe here?” I asked. “Because this road\r\nthat we are following connects with the upper air or used to do so,\r\nsince once I followed it. It is a long road and the climb is steep, but\r\nat last it leads to the light of the blessed sun, nor are there any\r\npitfalls in the path. Would that we might tread it together, Humphrey,”\r\nshe added with passion, “and be rid of mysteries and the gloom, or that\r\nlight which is worse than gloom.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” I asked eagerly. “Why should we not turn and flee?”\r\n\r\n“Who can flee from my father, the Lord Oro?” she replied. “He would\r\nsnare us before we had gone a mile. Moreover, if we fled, by tomorrow\r\nhalf the world must perish.”\r\n\r\n“And how can we save it by not flying, Yva?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know, Humphrey, yet I think it will be saved, perchance by\r\nsacrifice. That is the keystone of your faith, is it not? Therefore if\r\nit is asked of you to save the world, you will not shrink from it, will\r\nyou, Humphrey?”\r\n\r\n“I hope not,” I replied, without enthusiasm, I admit. Indeed it struck\r\nme that a business of this sort was better fitted to Bastin than to\r\nmyself, or at any rate to his profession. I think she guessed my\r\nthoughts, for by the light of the lamp I saw her smile in her dazzling\r\nway. Then after a swift glance behind her, she turned and suddenly\r\nkissed me, as she did so calling down everlasting blessings on my head\r\nand on my spirit. There was something very wonderful about this\r\nbenediction of Yva’s and it thrilled me through and through, so that to\r\nit I could make no answer.\r\n\r\nNext moment it was too late to retreat, for our narrowing passage\r\nturned and we found ourselves in a wondrous place. I call it wondrous\r\nbecause of it we could see neither the beginning nor the end, nor the\r\nroof, nor aught else save the rock on which we walked, and the side or\r\nwall that our hands touched. Nor was this because of darkness, since\r\nalthough it was not illuminated like the upper caverns, light of a sort\r\nwas present. It was a very strange light, consisting of brilliant and\r\nintermittent flashes, or globes of blue and lambent flame which seemed\r\nto leap from nowhere into nowhere, or sometimes to hang poised in mid\r\nair.\r\n\r\n“How odd they are,” said the voice of Bastin behind me. “They remind me\r\nof those blue sparks which jump up from the wires of the tramways in\r\nLondon on a dark night. You know, don’t you, Bickley? I mean when the\r\nconductor pulls round that long stick with an iron wheel on the top of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody but you could have thought of such a comparison, Bastin,”\r\nanswered Bickley. “Still, multiplied a thousandfold they are not\r\nunlike.”\r\n\r\nNor indeed were they, except that each blue flash was as big as the\r\nfull moon and in one place or another they were so continuous that one\r\ncould have read a letter by their light. Also the effect of them was\r\nghastly and most unnatural, terrifying, too, since even their\r\nbrilliance could not reveal the extent of that gigantic hollow in the\r\nbowels of the world wherein they leapt to and fro like lightnings, or\r\nhung like huge, uncanny lanterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nSacrifice\r\n\r\n\r\n“The air in this place must be charged with some form of electricity,\r\nbut the odd thing is that it does not seem to harm us,” said Bickley in\r\na matter-of-fact fashion as though he were determined not to be\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\n“To me it looks more like marsh fires or St. Elmo lights, though how\r\nthese can be where there is no vapour, I do not know,” I answered.\r\n\r\nAs I spoke a particularly large ball of flame fell from above. It\r\nresembled a shooting star or a meteor more than anything else that I\r\nhad ever seen, and made me wonder whether we were not perhaps standing\r\nbeneath some inky, unseen sky.\r\n\r\nNext moment I forgot such speculations, for in its blue light, which\r\nmade him terrible and ghastly, I perceived Oro standing in front of us\r\nclad in a long cloak.\r\n\r\n“Dear me!” said Bastin, “he looks just like the devil, doesn’t he, and\r\nnow I come to think of it, this isn’t at all a bad imitation of hell.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know it is an imitation?” asked Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Because whatever might be the case with you, Bickley, if it were, the\r\nLady Yva and I should not be here.”\r\n\r\nEven then I could not help smiling at this repartee, but the argument\r\nwent no further for Oro held up his hand and Yva bent the knee in\r\ngreeting to him.\r\n\r\n“So you have come, all of you,” he said. “I thought that perhaps there\r\nwere one or two who would not find courage to ride the flying stone. I\r\nam glad that it is not so, since otherwise he who had shown himself a\r\ncoward should have had no share in the rule of that new world which is\r\nto be. Therefore I chose yonder road that it might test you.”\r\n\r\n“Then if you will be so good as to choose another for us to return by,\r\nI shall be much obliged to you, Oro,” said Bastin.\r\n\r\n“How do you know that if I did it would not be more terrible, Preacher?\r\nHow do you know indeed that this is not your last journey from which\r\nthere is no return?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I can’t be sure of anything, Oro, but I think the question\r\nis one which you might more appropriately put to yourself. According to\r\nyour own showing you are now extremely old and therefore your end is\r\nlikely to come at any moment. Of course, however, if it did you would\r\nhave one more journey to make, but it wouldn’t be polite for me to say\r\nin what direction.”\r\n\r\nOro heard, and his splendid, icy face was twisted with sudden rage.\r\nRemembering the scene in the temple where he had grovelled before his\r\ngod, uttering agonised, unanswered prayers for added days, I understood\r\nthe reason of his wrath. It was so great that I feared lest he should\r\nkill Bastin (who only a few hours before, be it remembered, had tried\r\nto kill _him_) then and there, as doubtless he could have done if he\r\nwished. Fortunately, if he felt it; the impulse passed.\r\n\r\n“Miserable fool!” he said. “I warn you to keep a watch upon your words.\r\nYesterday you would have slain me with your toy. Today you stab me with\r\nyour ill-omened tongue. Be fearful lest I silence it for ever.”\r\n\r\n“I am not in the least fearful, Oro, since I am sure that _you_ can’t\r\nhurt me at all any more than I could hurt you last night because, you\r\nsee, it wasn’t permitted. When the time comes for me to die, I shall\r\ngo, but _you_ will have nothing to do with that. To tell the truth, I\r\nam very sorry for you, as with all your greatness, your soul is of the\r\nearth, earthy, also sensual and devilish, as the Apostle said, and, I\r\nam afraid, very malignant, and you will have a great deal to answer for\r\nshortly. Yours _won’t_ be a happy deathbed, Oro, because, you see, you\r\nglory in your sins and don’t know what repentance means.”\r\n\r\nI must add that when I heard these words I was filled with the most\r\nunbounded admiration for Bastin’s fearless courage which enabled him\r\nthus to beard this super-tyrant in his den. So indeed were we all, for\r\nI read it in Yva’s face and heard Bickley mutter:\r\n\r\n“Bravo! Splendid! After all there is something in faith!”\r\n\r\nEven Oro appreciated it with his intellect, if not with his heart, for\r\nhe stared at the man and made no answer. In the language of the ring,\r\nhe was quite “knocked out” and, almost humbly, changed the subject.\r\n\r\n“We have yet a little while,” he said, “before that happens which I\r\nhave decreed. Come, Humphrey, that I may show you some of the marvels\r\nof this bubble blown in the bowels of the world,” and he motioned to us\r\nto pick up the lanterns.\r\n\r\nThen he led us away from the wall of the cavern, if such it was, for a\r\ndistance of perhaps six or seven hundred paces. Here suddenly we came\r\nto a great groove in the rocky floor, as broad as a very wide roadway,\r\nand mayhap four feet in depth. The bottom of this groove was polished\r\nand glittered; indeed it gave us the impression of being iron, or other\r\nore which had been welded together beneath the grinding of some\r\nimmeasurable weight. Just at the spot where we struck the groove, it\r\ndivided into two, for this reason.\r\n\r\nIn its centre the floor of iron, or whatever it may have been, rose,\r\nthe fraction of an inch at first, but afterwards more sharply, and this\r\nat a spot where the groove had a somewhat steep downward dip which\r\nappeared to extend onwards I know not how far.\r\n\r\nFollowing along this central rise for a great way, nearly a mile, I\r\nshould think, we observed that it became ever more pronounced, till at\r\nlength it ended in a razor-edge cliff which stretched up higher than we\r\ncould see, even by the light of the electrical discharges. Standing\r\nagainst the edge of this cliff, we perceived that at a distance from it\r\nthere were now _two_ grooves of about equal width. One of these ran\r\naway into the darkness on our right as we faced the sharp edge, and at\r\nan ever-widening angle, while the other, at a similar angle, ran into\r\nthe darkness to the left of the knife of cliff. That was all.\r\n\r\nNo, there were two more notable things. Neither of the grooves now lay\r\nwithin hundreds of yards of the cliff, perhaps a quarter of a mile, for\r\nbe it remembered we had followed the rising rock between them. To put\r\nit quite clearly, it was exactly as though one line of rails had\r\nseparated into two lines of rails, as often enough they do, and an\r\nobserver standing on high ground between could see them both vanishing\r\ninto tunnels to the right and left, but far apart.\r\n\r\nThe second notable thing was that the right-hand groove, where first we\r\nsaw it at the point of separation, was not polished like the left-hand\r\ngroove, although at some time or other it seemed to have been subjected\r\nto the pressure of the same terrific weight which cut its fellow out of\r\nthe bed of rock or iron, as the sharp wheels of a heavily laden wagon\r\nsink ruts into a roadway.\r\n\r\n“What does it all mean, Lord Oro?” I asked when he had led us back to\r\nthe spot where the one groove began to be two grooves, that is, a mile\r\nor so away from the razor-edged cliff.\r\n\r\n“This, Humphrey,” he answered. “That which travels along yonder road,\r\nwhen it reaches this spot on which we stand, follows the left-hand path\r\nwhich is made bright with its passage. Yet, could a giant at that\r\nmoment of its touching this exact spot on which I lay my hand, thrust\r\nit with sufficient strength, it would leave the left-hand road and take\r\nthe right-hand road.”\r\n\r\n“And if it did, what then; Lord Oro?”\r\n\r\n“Then within an hour or so, when it had travelled far enough upon its\r\nway, the balance of the earth would be changed, and great things would\r\nhappen in the world above, as once they happened in bygone days. Now do\r\nyou understand, Humphrey?”\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens! Yes, I understand now,” I answered. “But fortunately\r\nthere is no such giant.”\r\n\r\nOro broke into a mocking laugh and his grey old face lit up with a\r\nfiendish exultation, as he cried:\r\n\r\n“Fool! I, Oro, am that giant. Once in the dead days I turned the\r\nbalance of the world from the right-hand road which now is dull with\r\ndisuse, to the left-hand road which glitters so brightly to your eyes,\r\nand the face of the earth was changed. Now again I will turn it from\r\nthe left-hand road to the right-hand road in which for millions of\r\nyears it was wont to run, and once more the face of the earth shall\r\nchange, and those who are left living upon the earth, or who in the\r\ncourse of ages shall come to live upon the new earth, must bow down to\r\nOro and take him and his seed to be their gods and kings.”\r\n\r\nWhen I heard this I was overwhelmed and could not answer. Also I\r\nremembered a certain confused picture which Yva had shown to us in the\r\nTemple of Nyo. But supported by his disbelief, Bickley asked:\r\n\r\n“And how often does the balance of which you speak come this way, Lord\r\nOro?”\r\n\r\n“Once only in many years; the number is my secret, Bickley,” he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n“Then there is every reason to hope that it will not trouble us,”\r\nremarked Bickley with a suspicion of mockery in his voice.\r\n\r\n“Do you think so, you learned Bickley?” asked Oro. “If so, I do not.\r\nUnless my skill has failed me and my calculations have gone awry, that\r\nTraveller of which I tell should presently be with us. Hearken now!\r\nWhat is that sound we hear?”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there reached our ears the first, far-off murmurs of a\r\ndreadful music. I cannot describe it in words because that is\r\nimpossible, but it was something like to the buzz of a thousand\r\nhumming-tops such as are loved by children because of their weird song.\r\n\r\n“Back to the wall!” cried Oro triumphantly. “The time is short!”\r\n\r\nSo back we went, Oro pausing a while behind and overtaking us with\r\nlong, determined strides. Yva led us, gliding at my side and, as I\r\nthought, now and again glanced at my face with a look that was half\r\nanxious and half pitiful. Also twice she stooped and patted Tommy.\r\n\r\nWe reached the wall, though not quite at the spot whence we had started\r\nto examine the grooved roads. At least I think this was so, since now\r\nfor the first time I observed a kind of little window in its rocky\r\nface. It stood about five feet from its floor level, and was perhaps\r\nten inches square, not more. In short, except for its shape it\r\nresembled a ship’s porthole rather than a window. Its substance\r\nappeared to be talc, or some such material, and inches thick, yet\r\nthrough it, after Oro had cast aside some sort of covering, came a\r\nglare like that of a search-light. In fact it was a search-light so far\r\nas concerned one of its purposes.\r\n\r\nBy this window or porthole lay a pile of cloaks, also four objects\r\nwhich looked like Zulu battle shields cut in some unknown metal or\r\nmaterial. Very deftly, very quietly, Yva lifted these cloaks and\r\nwrapped one of them about each of us, and while she was thus employed I\r\nnoticed that they were of a substance very similar to that of the gown\r\nshe wore, which I have described, but harder. Next she gave one of the\r\nmetal-like shields to each of us, bidding us hold them in front of our\r\nbodies and heads, and only to look through certain slits in them in\r\nwhich were eyepieces that appeared to be of the same horny stuff as the\r\nsearchlight window. Further, she commanded us to stand in a row with\r\nour backs against the rock wall, at certain spots which she indicated\r\nwith great precision, and whatever we saw or heard on no account to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nSo there we stood, Bickley next to me, and beyond him Bastin. Then Yva\r\ntook the fourth shield, as I noted a much larger one than ours, and\r\nplaced herself between me and the search-light or porthole. On the\r\nother side of this was Oro who had no shield.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements took some minutes and during that time occupied all\r\nour attention. When they were completed, however, our curiosity and\r\nfear began to reassert themselves. I looked about me and perceived that\r\nOro had his right hand upon what seemed to be a rough stone rod, in\r\nshape not unlike that with which railway points are moved. He shouted\r\nto us to stand still and keep the shields over our faces. Then very\r\ngently he pressed upon the lever. The porthole sank the fraction of an\r\ninch, and instantly there leapt from it a most terrific blaze of\r\nlightning, which shot across the blackness in front and, as lightning\r\ndoes, revealed far, far away another wall, or rather cliff, like that\r\nagainst which we leant.\r\n\r\n“All works well,” exclaimed Oro in a satisfied voice, lifting his hand\r\nfrom the rod, “and the strength which I have stored will be more than\r\nenough.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the humming noise came nearer and grew in volume.\r\n\r\n“I say,” said Bickley, “as you know, I have been sceptical, but I don’t\r\nlike this business. Oro, what are you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“Sink half the world beneath the seas,” said Oro, “and raise up that\r\nwhich I drowned more than two thousand centuries ago. But as you do not\r\nbelieve that I have this power, Bickley, why do you ask such\r\nquestions?”\r\n\r\n“_I_ believe that you have it, which was why I tried to shoot you\r\nyesterday,” said Bastin. “For your soul’s sake I beg you to desist from\r\nan attempt which I am sure will not succeed, but which will certainly\r\ninvolve your eternal damnation, since the failure will be no fault of\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\nThen I spoke also, saying:\r\n\r\n“I implore you, Lord Oro, to let this business be. I do not know\r\nexactly how much or how little you can do, but I understand that your\r\nobject is to slay men by millions in order to raise up another world of\r\nwhich you will be the absolute king, as you were of some past empire\r\nthat has been destroyed, either through your agency or otherwise. No\r\ngood can come of such ambitions. Like Bastin, for your soul’s sake I\r\npray you to let them be.”\r\n\r\n“What Humphrey says I repeat,” said Yva. “My Father, although you know\r\nit not, you seek great evil, and from these hopes you sow you will\r\nharvest nothing save a loss of which you do not dream. Moreover, your\r\nplans will fail. Now I who am, like yourself, of the Children of\r\nWisdom, have spoken, for the first and last time, and my words are\r\ntrue. I pray you give them weight, my Father.”\r\n\r\nOro heard, and grew furious.\r\n\r\n“What!” he said. “Are you against me, every one, and my own daughter\r\nalso? I would lift you up, I would make you rulers of a new world; I\r\nwould destroy your vile civilisations which I have studied with my\r\neyes, that I may build better! To you, Humphrey, I would give my only\r\nchild in marriage that from you may spring a divine race of kings! And\r\nyet you are against me and set up your puny scruples as a barrier\r\nacross my path of wisdom. Well, I tread them down, I go on my appointed\r\nway. But beware how you try to hold me back. If any one of you should\r\nattempt to come between me and my ends, know that I will destroy you\r\nall. Obey or die.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he has had his chance and he won’t take it,” said Bastin in the\r\nsilence that followed. “The man must go to the devil his own way and\r\nthere is nothing more to be said.”\r\n\r\nI say the silence, but it was no more silent. The distant humming grew\r\nto a roar, the roar to a hellish hurricane of sound which presently\r\ndrowned all attempts at ordinary speech.\r\n\r\nThen bellowing like ten millions of bulls, at length far away there\r\nappeared something terrible. I can only describe its appearance as that\r\nof an attenuated mountain on fire. When it drew nearer I perceived that\r\nit was more like a ballet-dancer whirling round and round upon her\r\ntoes, or rather all the ballet-dancers in the world rolled into one and\r\nthen multiplied a million times in size. No, it was like a mushroom\r\nwith two stalks, one above and one below, or a huge top with a point on\r\nwhich it spun, a swelling belly and another point above. But what a\r\ntop! It must have been two thousand feet high, if it was an inch, and\r\nits circumference who could measure?\r\n\r\nOn it came, dancing, swaying and spinning at a rate inconceivable, so\r\nthat it looked like a gigantic wheel of fire. Yet it was not fire that\r\nclothed it but rather some phosphorescence, since from it came no heat.\r\nYes, a phosphorescence arranged in bands of ghastly blue and lurid red,\r\nwith streaks of other colours running up between, and a kind of waving\r\nfringe of purple.\r\n\r\nThe fire-mountain thundered on with a voice like to that of avalanches\r\nor of icebergs crashing from their parent glaciers to the sea. Its\r\nterrific aspect was appalling, and its weight caused the solid rock to\r\nquiver like a leaf. Watching it, we felt as ants might feel at the\r\nadvent of the crack of doom, for its mere height and girth and size\r\noverwhelmed us. We could not even speak. The last words I heard were\r\nfrom the mouth of Oro who screamed out:\r\n\r\n“Behold the balance of the World, you miserable, doubting men, and\r\nbehold me change its path—turning it as the steersman turns a ship!”\r\n\r\nThen he made certain signs to Yva, who in obedience to them approached\r\nthe porthole or search-light to which she did something that I could\r\nnot distinguish. The effect was to make the beam of light much stronger\r\nand sharper, also to shift it on to the point or foot of the spinning\r\nmountain and, by an aiming of the lens from time to time, to keep it\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThis went on for a while, since the dreadful thing did not travel fast\r\nnotwithstanding the frightful speed of its revolutions. I should doubt\r\nindeed if it advanced more quickly than a man could walk; at any rate\r\nso it seemed to us. But we had no means of judging its real rate of\r\nprogress whereof we knew as little as we did of the course it followed\r\nin the bowels of the earth. Perhaps that was spiral, from the world’s\r\ndeep heart upwards, and this was the highest point it reached. Or\r\nperhaps it remained stationary, but still spinning, for scores or\r\nhundreds of years in some central powerhouse of its own, whence, in\r\nobedience to unknown laws, from time to time it made these terrific\r\njourneys.\r\n\r\nNo one knows, unless perhaps Oro did, in which case he kept the\r\ninformation to himself, and no one will ever know. At any rate there it\r\nwas, travelling towards us on its giant butt, the peg of the top as it\r\nwere, which, hidden in a cloud of friction-born sparks that enveloped\r\nit like the cup of a curving flower of fire, whirled round and round at\r\nan infinite speed. It was on this flaming flower that the search-light\r\nplayed steadily, doubtless that Oro might mark and measure its\r\nmonstrous progress.\r\n\r\n“He is going to try to send the thing down the right-hand path,” I\r\nshouted into Bickley’s ear.\r\n\r\n“Can’t be done! Nothing can shift a travelling weight of tens of\r\nmillions of tons one inch,” Bickley roared back, trying to look\r\nconfident.\r\n\r\nClearly, however, Yva thought that it could be done, for of a sudden\r\nshe cast down her shield and, throwing herself upon her knees,\r\nstretched out her hands in supplication to her father. I understood, as\r\ndid we all, that she was imploring him to abandon his hellish purpose.\r\nHe glared at her and shook his head. Then, as she still went on\r\npraying, he struck her across the face with his hand and pushed her to\r\nher feet again. My blood boiled as I saw it and I think I should have\r\nsprung at him, had not Bickley caught hold of me, shouting, “Don’t, or\r\nhe will kill her and us too.”\r\n\r\nYva lifted her shield and returned to her station, and in the blue\r\ndischarges which now flashed almost continuously, and the\r\nphosphorescent glare of the advancing mountain, I saw that though her\r\nbeautiful face worked beneath the pain of the blow, her eyes remained\r\nserene and purposeful. Even then I wondered—what was the purpose\r\nshining through them. Also I wondered if I was about to be called upon\r\nto make that sacrifice of which she had spoken, and if so, how. Of one\r\nthing I was determined—that if the call came it should not find me\r\ndeaf. Yet all the while I was horribly afraid.\r\n\r\nAt another sign from Oro, Yva did something more to the lens—again,\r\nbeing alongside of her, I could not see what it was. The beam of light\r\nshifted and wandered till, far away, it fell exactly upon that spot\r\nwhere the rock began to rise into the ridge which separated the two\r\ngrooves or roads and ended in the razor-edged cliff. Moreover I\r\nobserved that Oro, who left it the last of us, had either placed\r\nsomething white to mark this first infinitesimal bulging of the floor\r\nof the groove, or had smeared it with chalk or shining pigment. I\r\nobserved also what I had not been able to see before, that a thin white\r\nline ran across the floor, no doubt to give the precise direction of\r\nthis painted rise of rock, and that the glare of the search-light now\r\nlay exactly over that line.\r\n\r\nThe monstrous, flaming gyroscope fashioned in Nature’s workshop, for\r\nsuch without doubt it was, was drawing near, emitting as it came a\r\ntumult of sounds which, with the echoes that they caused, almost\r\nover-whelmed our senses. Poor little Tommy, already cowed, although he\r\nwas a bold-natured beast, broke down entirely, and I could see from his\r\nopen mouth that he was howling with terror. He stared about him, then\r\nran to Yva and pawed at her, evidently asking to be taken into her\r\narms. She thrust him away, almost fiercely, and made signs to me to\r\nlift him up and hold him beneath my shield. This I did, reflecting\r\nsadly that if I was to be sacrificed, Tommy must share my fate. I even\r\nthought of passing him on to Bickley, but had no time. Indeed I could\r\nnot attract his attention, for Bickley was staring with all his eyes at\r\nthe nightmare-like spectacle which was in progress about us. Indeed no\r\nnightmare, no wild imagination of which the mind of man is capable,\r\ncould rival the aspect of its stupendous facts.\r\n\r\nThink of them! The unmeasured space of blackness threaded by those\r\nglobes of ghastly incandescence that now hung a while and now shot\r\nupwards, downwards, across, apparently without origin or end, like a\r\nstream of meteors that had gone mad. Then the travelling mountain, two\r\nthousand feet in height, or more, with its enormous saucer-like rim\r\npainted round with bands of lurid red and blue, and about its grinding\r\nfoot the tulip bloom of emitted flame. Then the fierce-faced Oro at his\r\npost, his hand upon the rod, waiting, remorseless, to drown half of\r\nthis great world, with the lovely Yva standing calm-eyed like a saint\r\nin hell and watching me above the edge of the shield which such a saint\r\nmight bear to turn aside the fiery darts of the wicked. And lastly we\r\nthree men flattened terror-stricken, against the wall.\r\n\r\nNightmare! Imagination! No, these pale before that scene which it was\r\ngiven to our human eyes to witness.\r\n\r\nAnd all the while, bending, bowing towards us—away from us—making\r\nobeisance to the path in front as though in greeting, to the path\r\nbehind as though in farewell; instinct with a horrible life, with a\r\nhideous and gigantic grace, that titanic Terror whirled onwards to the\r\nmark of fate.\r\n\r\nAt the moment nothing could persuade me that it was not alive and did\r\nnot know its awful mission. Visions flashed across my mind. I thought\r\nof the peoples of the world sleeping in their beds, or going about\r\ntheir business, or engaged even in the work of war. I thought of the\r\nships upon the seas steaming steadily towards their far-off ports. Then\r\nI thought of what presently might happen to them, of the tremors\r\nfollowed by convulsions, of the sudden crashing down of cities, such as\r\nwe had seen in the picture Yva showed us in the Temple, of the inflow\r\nof the waters of the deep piled up in mighty waves, of the woe and\r\ndesolation as of the end of the world, and of the quiet, following\r\ndeath. So I thought and in my heart prayed to the great Arch-Architect\r\nof the Universe to stretch out His Arm to avert this fearsome ruin of\r\nHis handiwork.\r\n\r\nOro glared, his thin fingers tightened their grip upon the rod, his\r\nhair and long beard seemed to bristle with furious and delighted\r\nexcitement. The purple-fringed rim of the Monster had long overshadowed\r\nthe whited patch of rock; its grinding foot was scarce ten yards away.\r\nOro made more signs to Yva who, beneath the shelter of her shield,\r\nagain bent down and did something that I could not see. Then, as though\r\nher part were played, she rose, drew the grey hood of her cloak all\r\nabout her face so that her eyes alone remained visible, took one step\r\ntowards me and in the broken English we had taught her, called into my\r\near.\r\n\r\n“Humphrey, God you bless! Humphrey, we meet soon. Forget not me!”\r\n\r\nShe stepped back again before I could attempt to answer, and next\r\ninstant with a hideous, concentrated effort, Oro bending himself\r\ndouble, thrust upon the rod, as I could see from his open mouth,\r\nshouting while he thrust.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, with a swift spring, Yva leapt immediately in front\r\nof the lens or window, so that the metallic shield with which she\r\ncovered herself pressed against its substance.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously Oro flung up his arms as though in horror.\r\n\r\nToo late! The shutter fell and from behind it there sprang out a rush\r\nof living flame. It struck on Yva’s shield and expanded to right and\r\nleft. The insulated shield and garments that she wore seemed to resist\r\nit. For a fraction of time she stood there like a glowing angel,\r\nwrapped in fire.\r\n\r\nThen she was swept outwards and upwards and at a little distance\r\ndissolved like a ghost and vanished from our sight.\r\n\r\nYva was ashes! Yva was gone! The sacrifice was consummated!\r\n\r\nAnd not in vain! Not in vain! On her poor breast she had received the\r\nfull blast of that hellish lightning flash. Yet whilst destroying, it\r\nturned away from her, seeking the free paths of the air. So it came\r\nabout that its obstructed strength struck the foot of the travelling\r\ngyroscope, diffused and did not suffice to thrust it that one necessary\r\ninch on which depended the fate of half the world, or missing it\r\naltogether, passed away on either side. Even so the huge, gleaming\r\nmountain rocked and trembled. Once, twice, thrice, it bowed itself\r\ntowards us as though in majestic homage to greatness passed away. For a\r\nsecond, too, its course was checked, and at the check the earth quaked\r\nand trembled. Yes, then the world shook, and the blue globes of fire\r\nwent out, while I was thrown to the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned again, the flaming monster was once more sailing\r\nmajestically upon its way and _down the accustomed left-hand path!_\r\n\r\nIndeed the sacrifice was not in vain. The world shook—but Yva had saved\r\nthe world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nTommy\r\n\r\n\r\nI lay still a while, on my back as I had fallen, and beneath the\r\nshield-like defence which Yva had given to me. Notwithstanding the\r\nfire-resisting, metalised stuff of which it was made, I noted that it\r\nwas twisted and almost burnt through. Doubtless the stored-up\r\nelectricity or earth magnetism, or whatever it may have been that had\r\nleapt out of that hole, being diffused by the resistance with which it\r\nwas met, had grazed me with its outer edge, and had it not been for the\r\nshield and cloak, I also should have been burned up. I wished, oh! how\r\nI wished that it had been so. Then, by now all must have finished and I\r\nshould have known the truth as to what awaits us beyond the change:\r\nsleep, or dreams, or perchance the fullest life. Also I should not have\r\nlearned alone.\r\n\r\nLying there thus, idly, as though in a half-sleep, I felt Tommy licking\r\nmy face, and throwing my arm about the poor little frightened beast, I\r\nwatched the great world-balance as it retreated on its eternal journey.\r\nAt one time its vast projecting rim had overshadowed us and almost\r\nseemed to touch the cliff of rock against which we leant. I remember\r\nthat the effect of that shining arch a thousand feet or so above our\r\nheads was wonderful. It reminded me of a canopy of blackest thunder\r\nclouds supported upon a framework of wheeling rainbows, while beneath\r\nit all the children of the devil shouted together in joy. I noted this\r\neffect only a few seconds before Yva spoke to me and leapt into the\r\npath of the flash.\r\n\r\nNow, however, it was far away, a mere flaming wheel that became\r\ngradually smaller, and its Satanic voices were growing faint. As I have\r\nsaid, I watched its disappearance idly, reflecting that I should never\r\nlook upon its like again; also that it was something well worth going\r\nforth to see. Then I became aware that the humming, howling din had\r\ndecreased sufficiently to enable me to hear human voices without\r\neffort. Bastin was addressing Bickley—like myself they were both upon\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n“Her translation, as you may have noticed, Bickley, if you were not too\r\nfrightened, was really very remarkable. No doubt it will have reminded\r\nyou, as it did me, of that of Elijah. She had exactly the appearance of\r\na person going up to Heaven in a vehicle of fire. The destination was\r\ncertainly the same, and even the cloak she wore added a familiar touch\r\nand increased the similarity.”\r\n\r\n“At any rate it did not fall upon you,” answered Bickley with something\r\nlike a sob, in a voice of mingled awe and exasperation. “For goodness’\r\nsake! Bastin, stop your Biblical parallels and let us adore, yes, let\r\nus adore the divinest creature that the earth has borne!”\r\n\r\nNever have I loved Bickley more than when I heard him utter those\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n“‘Divinest’ is a large term, Bickley, and one to which I hesitate to\r\nsubscribe, remembering as I do certain of the prophets and the Early\r\nFathers with all their faults, not of course to mention the Apostles.\r\nBut—” here he paused, for suddenly all three of us became aware of Oro.\r\n\r\nHe also has been thrown to the ground by the strength of the prisoned\r\nforces which he gathered and loosed upon their unholy errand, but, as I\r\nrejoiced to observe, had suffered from them much more than ourselves.\r\nDoubtless this was owing to the fact that he had sprung forward in a\r\nlast wild effort to save his daughter, or to prevent her from\r\ninterfering with his experiment, I know not which. As a result his\r\nright cheek was much scorched, his right arm was withered and helpless,\r\nand his magnificent beard was half burnt off him. Further, very\r\nevidently he was suffering from severe shock, for he rocked upon his\r\nfeet and shook like an aspen leaf. All this, however, did not interfere\r\nwith the liveliness of his grief and rage.\r\n\r\nThere he stood, a towering shape, like a lightning-smitten statue, and\r\ncursed us, especially Bastin.\r\n\r\n“My daughter has gone!” he cried, “burned up by the fiery power that is\r\nmy servant. Nothing remains of her but dust, and, Priest, this is your\r\ndoing. You poisoned her heart with your childish doctrines of mercy and\r\nsacrifice, and the rest, so that she threw herself into the path of the\r\nflash to save some miserable races that she had never even known.”\r\n\r\nHe paused exhausted, whereon Bastin answered him with spirit:\r\n\r\n“Yes, Oro, she being a holy woman, has gone where you will never follow\r\nher. Also it is your own fault since you should have listened to her\r\nentreaties instead of boxing her ears like the brute you are.”\r\n\r\n“My daughter is gone,” went on Oro, recovering his strength, “and my\r\ngreat designs are ruined. Yet only for a while,” he added, “for the\r\nworld-balance will return again, if not till long after your life-spans\r\nare done.”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t doctor yourself, Lord Oro,” said Bickley, also rising, “I\r\nmay tell you as one who understands such things, that most likely it\r\nwill be after your life-span is done also. Although their effect may be\r\ndelayed, severe shocks from burns and over-excitement are apt to prove\r\nfatal to the aged.”\r\n\r\nOro snarled at him; no other word describes it.\r\n\r\n“And there are other things, Physician,” he said, “which are apt to\r\nprove fatal to the young. At least now you will no longer deny my\r\npower.”\r\n\r\n“I am not so sure,” answered Bickley, “since it seems that there is a\r\ngreater Power, namely that of a woman’s love and sacrifice.”\r\n\r\n“And a greater still,” interrupted Bastin, “Which put those ideas into\r\nher head.”\r\n\r\n“As for you, Humphrey,” went on Oro, “I rejoice to think that you at\r\nleast have lost two things that man desires above all other things—the\r\nwoman you sought and the future kingship of the world.”\r\n\r\nI stood up and faced him.\r\n\r\n“The first I have gained, although how, you do not understand, Oro,” I\r\nanswered. “And of the second, seeing that it would have come through\r\nyou, on your conditions, I am indeed glad to be rid. I wish no power\r\nthat springs from murder, and no gifts from one who answered his\r\ndaughter’s prayer with blows.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment he seemed remorseful.\r\n\r\n“She vexed me with her foolishness,” he said. Then his rage blazed up\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n“And it was you who taught it to her,” he went on. “You are guilty, all\r\nthree of you, and therefore I am left with none to serve me in my age;\r\ntherefore also my mighty schemes are overthrown.”\r\n\r\n“Also, Oro, if you speak truth, therefore half the world is saved,” I\r\nadded quietly, “and one has left it of whom it was unworthy.”\r\n\r\n“You think that these civilisations of yours, as you are pleased to\r\ncall them, are saved, do you?” he sneered. “Yet, even if Bickley were\r\nright and I should die and become powerless, I tell you that they are\r\nalready damned. I have studied them in your books and seen them with my\r\neyes, and I say that they are rotten before ever they are ripe, and\r\nthat their end shall be the end of the Sons of Wisdom, to die for lack\r\nof increase. That is why I would have saved the East, because in it\r\nalone there is increase, and thence alone can rise the great last race\r\nof man which I would have given to your children for an heritage.\r\nMoreover, think not that you Westerners have done with wars. I tell you\r\nthat they are but begun and that the sword shall eat you up, and what\r\nthe sword spares class shall snatch from class in the struggle for\r\nsupremacy and ease.”\r\n\r\nThus he spoke with extraordinary and concentrated bitterness that I\r\nconfess would have frightened me, had I been capable of fear, which at\r\nthe moment I was not. Who is afraid when he has lost all?\r\n\r\nNor was Bastin alarmed, if for other reasons.\r\n\r\n“I think it right to tell you, Oro,” he said, “that the only future you\r\nneed trouble about is your own. God Almighty will look after the\r\nwestern civilisations in whatever way He may think best, as you may\r\nremember He did just now. Only I am sure you won’t be here to see how\r\nit is done.”\r\n\r\nAgain fury blazed in Oro’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“At least I will look after you, you half-bred dogs, who yap out\r\nill-omened prophecies of death into my face. Since the three of you\r\nloved my daughter whom you brought to her doom, and were by her\r\nbeloved, if differently, I think it best that you should follow on her\r\nroad. How? That is the question? Shall I leave you to starve in these\r\ngreat caves?—Nay, look not towards the road of escape which doubtless\r\nshe pointed out to you, for, as Humphrey knows, I can travel swiftly\r\nand I will make sure that you find it blocked. Or shall I—” and he\r\nglanced upwards at the great globes of wandering fire, as though he\r\npurposed to summon them to be our death, as doubtless he could have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n“I do not care what you do,” I answered wearily. “Only I would beg you\r\nto strike quickly. Yet for my friends I am sorry, since it was I who\r\nled them on this quest, and for you, too, Tommy,” I added, looking at\r\nthe poor little hound. “You were foolish, Tommy,” I went on, “when you\r\nscented out that old tyrant in his coffin, at least for our own sake.”\r\n\r\nIndeed the dog was terribly scared. He whined continually and from time\r\nto time ran a little way and then returned to us, suggesting that we\r\nshould go from this horror-haunted spot. Lastly, as though he\r\nunderstood that it was Oro who kept us there, he went to him and\r\njumping up, licked his hand in a beseeching fashion.\r\n\r\nThe super-man looked at the dog and as he looked the rage went out of\r\nhis face and was replaced by something resembling pity.\r\n\r\n“I do not wish the beast to die,” he muttered to himself in low\r\nreflective tones, as though he thought aloud, “for of them all it alone\r\nliked and did not fear me. I might take it with me but still it would\r\nperish of grief in the loneliness of the caves. Moreover, she loved it\r\nwhom I shall see no more; yes, Yva—” as he spoke the name his voice\r\nbroke a little. “Yet if I suffer them to escape they will tell my story\r\nto the world and make me a laughingstock. Well, if they do, what does\r\nit matter? None of those Western fools would believe it; thinking that\r\nthey knew all; like Bickley they would mock and say that they were mad,\r\nor liars.”\r\n\r\nAgain Tommy licked his hand, but more confidently, as though instinct\r\ntold him something of what was passing in Oro’s mind. I watched with an\r\nidle wonder, marvelling whether it were possible that this merciless\r\nbeing would after all spare us for the sake of the dog.\r\n\r\nSo, strange to say, it came about, for suddenly Oro looked up and said:\r\n\r\n“Get you gone, and quickly, before my mood changes. The hound has saved\r\nyou. For its sake I give you your lives, who otherwise should certainly\r\nhave died. She who has gone pointed out to you, I doubt not, a road\r\nthat runs to the upper air. I think that it is still open. Indeed,” he\r\nadded, closing his eyes for a moment, “I see that it is still open, if\r\nlong and difficult. Follow it, and should you win through, take your\r\nboat and sail away as swiftly as you can. Whether you die or live I\r\ncare nothing, but my hands will be clean of your blood, although yours\r\nare stained with Yva’s. Begone! and my curse go with you.”\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for further words we went to fetch our lanterns,\r\nwater-bottles and bag of food which we had laid down at a little\r\ndistance. As we approached them I looked up and saw Oro standing some\r\nway off. The light from one of the blue globes of fire which passed\r\nclose above his head, shone upon him and made him ghastly. Moreover, it\r\nseemed to me as though approaching death had written its name upon his\r\nmalevolent countenance.\r\n\r\nI turned my head away, for about his aspect in those sinister\r\nsurroundings there was something horrible, something menacing and\r\nrepellent to man and of him I wished to see no more. Nor indeed did I,\r\nfor when I glanced in that direction again Oro was gone. I suppose that\r\nhe had retreated into the shadows where no light played.\r\n\r\nWe gathered up our gear, and while the others were relighting the\r\nlanterns, I walked a few paces forward to the spot where Yva had been\r\ndissolved in the devouring fire. Something caught my eye upon the rocky\r\nfloor. I picked it up. It was the ring, or rather the remains of the\r\nring that I had given her on that night when we declared our love\r\namidst the ruins by the crater lake. She had never worn it on her hand\r\nbut for her own reasons, as she told me, suspended it upon her breast\r\nbeneath her robe. It was an ancient ring that I had bought in Egypt,\r\nfashioned of gold in which was set a very hard basalt or other black\r\nstone. On this was engraved the _ank_ or looped cross, which was the\r\nEgyptian symbol of Life, and round it a snake, the symbol of Eternity.\r\nThe gold was for the most part melted, but the stone, being so hard and\r\nprotected by the shield and asbestos cloak, for such I suppose it was,\r\nhad resisted the fury of the flash. Only now it was white instead of\r\nblack, like a burnt onyx that had known the funeral pyre. Indeed,\r\nperhaps it was an onyx. I kissed it and hid it away, for it seemed to\r\nme to convey a greeting and with it a promise.\r\n\r\nThen we started, a very sad and dejected trio. Leaving with a shudder\r\nthat vast place where the blue lights played eternally, we came to the\r\nshaft up and down which the travelling stone pursued its endless path,\r\nand saw it arrive and depart again.\r\n\r\n“I wonder he did not send us that way,” said Bickley, pointing to it.\r\n\r\n“I am sure I am very glad it never occurred to him,” answered Bastin,\r\n“for I am certain that we could not have made the journey again without\r\nour guide, Yva.”\r\n\r\nI looked at him and he ceased. Somehow I could not bear, as yet, to\r\nhear her beloved name spoken by other lips.\r\n\r\nThen we entered the passage that she pointed out to us, and began a\r\nmost terrible journey which, so far as we could judge, for we lost any\r\nexact count of time, took us about sixty hours. The road, it is true,\r\nwas smooth and unblocked, but the ascent was fearfully steep and\r\nslippery; so much so that often we were obliged to pull each other up\r\nit and lie down to rest.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for those large, felt-covered bottles of Life-water, I\r\nam sure we should never have won through. But this marvelous elixir,\r\ndrunk a little at a time, always re-invigorated us and gave us strength\r\nto push on. Also we had some food, and fortunately our spare oil held\r\nout, for the darkness in that tunnel was complete. Tommy became so\r\nexhausted that at length we must carry him by turns. He would have died\r\nhad it not been for the water; indeed I thought that he was going to\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nAfter our last rest and a short sleep, however, he seemed to begin to\r\nrecover, and generally there was something in his manner which\r\nsuggested to us that he knew himself to be not far from the surface of\r\nthe earth towards which we had crawled upwards for thousands upon\r\nthousands of feet, fortunately without meeting with any zone of heat\r\nwhich was not bearable.\r\n\r\nWe were right, for when we had staggered forward a little further,\r\nsuddenly Tommy ran ahead of us and vanished. Then we heard him barking\r\nbut where we could not see, since the tunnel appeared to take a turn\r\nand continue, but this time on a downward course, while the sound of\r\nthe barks came from our right. We searched with the lanterns which were\r\nnow beginning to die and found a little hole almost filled with fallen\r\npieces of rock. We scooped these away with our hands, making an\r\naperture large enough to creep through. A few more yards and we saw\r\nlight, the blessed light of the moon, and in it stood Tommy barking\r\nhoarsely. Next we heard the sound of the sea. We struggled on\r\ndesperately and presently pushed our way through bushes and vegetation\r\non to a steep declivity. Down this we rolled and scrambled, to find\r\nourselves at last lying upon a sandy beach, whilst above us the full\r\nmoon shone in the heavens.\r\n\r\nHere, with a prayer of thankfulness, we flung ourselves down and slept.\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for Tommy and we had gone further along the tunnel,\r\nwhich I have little doubt stretched on beneath the sea, where, I\r\nwonder, should we have slept that night?\r\n\r\nWhen we woke the sun was shining high in the heavens. Evidently there\r\nhad been rain towards the dawn, though as we were lying beneath the\r\nshelter of some broad-leaved tree, from it we had suffered little\r\ninconvenience. Oh! how beautiful, after our sojourn in those unholy\r\ncaves, were the sun and the sea and the sweet air and the raindrops\r\nhanging on the leaves.\r\n\r\nWe did not wake of ourselves; indeed if we had been left alone I am\r\nsure that we should have slept the clock round, for we were terribly\r\nexhausted. What woke us was the chatter of a crowd of Orofenans who\r\nwere gathered at a distance from the tree and engaged in staring at us\r\nin a frightened way, also the barks of Tommy who objected to their\r\nintrusion. Among the people I recognised our old friend the chief\r\nMarama by his feather cloak, and sitting up, beckoned to him to\r\napproach. After a good deal of hesitation he came, walking delicately\r\nlike Agag, and stopping from time to time to study us, as though he\r\nwere not sure that we were real.\r\n\r\n“What frightens you, Marama?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“You frighten us, O Friend-from-the-Sea. Whence did you and the Healer\r\nand the Bellower come and why do your faces look like those of ghosts\r\nand why is the little black beast so large-eyed and so thin? Over the\r\nlake we know you did not come, for we have watched day and night;\r\nmoreover there is no canoe upon the shore. Also it would not have been\r\npossible.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” I asked idly.\r\n\r\n“Come and see,” he answered.\r\n\r\nRising stiffly we emerged from beneath the tree and perceived that we\r\nwere at the foot of the cliff against which the remains of the yacht\r\nhad been borne by the great tempest. Indeed there it was within a\r\ncouple of hundred yards of us.\r\n\r\nFollowing Marama we climbed the sloping path which ran up the cliff and\r\nascended a knoll whence we could see the lake and the cone of the\r\nvolcano in its centre. At least we used to be able to see this cone,\r\nbut now, at any rate with the naked eye, we could make out nothing,\r\nexcept a small brown spot in the midst of the waters of the lake.\r\n\r\n“The mountain which rose up many feet in that storm which brought you\r\nto Orofena, Friend-from-the-Sea, has now sunk till only the very top of\r\nit is to be seen,” said Marama solemnly. “Even the Rock of Offerings\r\nhas vanished beneath the water, and with it the house that we built for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said, affecting no surprise. “But when did that happen?”\r\n\r\n“Five nights ago the world shook, Friend-from-the-Sea, and when the sun\r\nrose we saw that the mouth of the cave which appeared on the day of\r\nyour coming, had vanished, and that the holy mountain itself had sunk\r\ndeep, so that now only the crest of it is left above the water.”\r\n\r\n“Such things happen,” I replied carelessly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Friend-from-the-Sea. Like many other marvels they happen where\r\nyou and your companions are. Therefore we beg you who can arise out of\r\nthe earth like spirits, to leave us at once before our island and all\r\nof us who dwell thereon are drowned beneath the ocean. Leave us before\r\nwe kill you, if indeed you be men, or die at your hands if, as we\r\nthink, you be evil spirits who can throw up mountains and drag them\r\ndown, and create gods that slay, and move about in the bowels of the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n“That is our intention, for our business here is done,” I answered\r\ncalmly. “Come now and help us to depart. But first bring us food. Bring\r\nit in plenty, for we must victual our boat.”\r\n\r\nMarama bowed and issued the necessary orders. Indeed food sufficient\r\nfor our immediate needs was already there as an offering, and of it we\r\nate with thankfulness.\r\n\r\nThen we boarded the ship and examined the lifeboat. Thanks to our\r\nprecautions it was still in very fair order and only needed some little\r\ncaulking which we did with grass fibre and pitch from the stores. After\r\nthis with the help of the Orofenans who worked hard in their desperate\r\ndesire to be rid of us, we drew the boat into the sea, and provisioned\r\nher with stores from the ship, and with an ample supply of water.\r\nEverything being ready at last, we waited for the evening wind which\r\nalways blew off shore, to start. As it was not due for half an hour or\r\nmore, I walked back to the tree under which we had slept and tried to\r\nfind the hole whence we had emerged from the tunnel on to the face of\r\nthe cliff.\r\n\r\nMy hurried search proved useless. The declivity of the cliff was\r\ncovered with tropical growth, and the heavy rain had washed away every\r\ntrace of our descent, and very likely filled the hole itself with\r\nearth. At any rate, of it I could discover nothing. Then as the breeze\r\nbegan to blow I returned to the boat and here bade adieu to Marama, who\r\ngave me his feather cloak as a farewell gift.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Friend-from-the-Sea,” he said to me. “We are glad to have\r\nseen you and thank you for many things. But we do not wish to see you\r\nany more.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Marama,” I answered. “What you say, we echo. At least you\r\nhave now no great lump upon your neck and we have rid you of your\r\nwizards. But beware of the god Oro who dwells in the mountain, for if\r\nyou anger him he will sink your island beneath the sea.”\r\n\r\n“And remember all that I have taught you,” shouted Bastin.\r\n\r\nMarama shivered, though whether at the mention of the god Oro, of whose\r\npowers the Orofenans had so painful a recollection, or at the result of\r\nBastin’s teachings, I do not know. And that was the last we shall ever\r\nsee of each other in this world.\r\n\r\nThe island faded behind us and, sore at heart because of all that we\r\nhad found and lost again, for three days we sailed northward with a\r\nfair and steady wind. On the fourth evening by an extraordinary stroke\r\nof fortune, we fell in with an American tramp steamer, trading from the\r\nSouth Sea Islands to San Francisco. To the captain, who treated us very\r\nkindly, we said simply that we were a party of Englishmen whose yacht\r\nhad been wrecked on a small island several hundreds of miles away, of\r\nwhich we knew neither the name, if it had one, nor the position.\r\n\r\nThis story was accepted without question, for such things often happen\r\nin those latitudes, and in due course we were landed at San Francisco,\r\nwhere we made certain depositions before the British Consul as to the\r\nloss of the yacht _Star of the South_. Then we crossed America, having\r\nobtained funds by cable, and sailed for England in a steamer flying the\r\nflag of the United States.\r\n\r\nOf the great war which made this desirable I do not speak since it has\r\nnothing, or rather little, to do with this history. In the end we\r\narrived safely at Liverpool, and thence travelled to our homes in\r\nDevonshire.\r\n\r\nThus ended the history of our dealings with Oro, the super-man who\r\nbegan his life more than two hundred and fifty thousand years ago, and\r\nwith his daughter, Yva, whom Bastin still often calls the Glittering\r\nLady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nBastin Discovers a Resemblance\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is little more to tell.\r\n\r\nShortly after our return Bickley, like a patriotic Englishman,\r\nvolunteered for service at the front and departed in the uniform of the\r\nR.A.M.C. Before he left he took the opportunity of explaining to Bastin\r\nhow much better it was in such a national emergency as existed, to\r\nbelong to a profession in which a man could do something to help the\r\nbodies of his countrymen that had been broken in the common cause, than\r\nto one like his in which it was only possible to pelt them with vain\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n“You think that, do you, Bickley?” answered Bastin. “Well, I hold that\r\nit is better to heal souls than bodies, because, as even you will have\r\nlearned out there in Orofena, they last so much longer.”\r\n\r\n“I am not certain that I learned anything of the sort,” said Bickley,\r\n“or even that Oro was more than an ordinary old man. He said that he\r\nhad lived a thousand years, but what was there to prove this except his\r\nword, which is worth nothing?”\r\n\r\n“There was the Lady Yva’s word also, which is worth a great deal,\r\nBickley.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but she may have meant a thousand moons. Further, as according to\r\nher own showing she was still quite young, how could she know her\r\nfather’s age?”\r\n\r\n“Quite so, Bickley. But all she actually said was that she was of the\r\nsame age as one of our women of twenty-seven, which may have meant two\r\nhundred and seventy for all I know. However, putting that aside you\r\nwill admit that they had both slept for two hundred and fifty thousand\r\nyears.”\r\n\r\n“I admit that they slept, Bastin, because I helped to awaken them, but\r\nfor how long there is nothing to show, except those star maps which are\r\nprobably quite inaccurate.”\r\n\r\n“They are not inaccurate,” I broke in, “for I have had them checked by\r\nleading astronomers who say that they show a marvelous knowledge of the\r\nheavens as these were two hundred and fifty thousand years ago, and are\r\ntoday.”\r\n\r\nHere I should state that those two metal maps and the ring which I gave\r\nto Yva and found again after the catastrophe, were absolutely the only\r\nthings connected with her or with Oro that we brought away with us. The\r\nformer I would never part with, feeling their value as evidence.\r\nTherefore, when we descended to the city Nyo and the depths beneath, I\r\ntook them with me wrapped in cloth in my pocket. Thus they were\r\npreserved. Everything else went when the Rock of Offerings and the cave\r\nmouth sank beneath the waters of the lake.\r\n\r\nThis may have happened either in the earth tremor, which no doubt was\r\ncaused by the advance of the terrific world-balance, or when the\r\nelectric power, though diffused and turned by Yva’s insulated body,\r\nstruck the great gyroscope’s travelling foot with sufficient strength,\r\nnot to shift it indeed on to the right-hand path as Oro had designed,\r\nbut still to cause it to stagger and even perhaps to halt for the\r\nfraction of a second. Even this pause may have been enough to cause\r\nconvulsions of the earth above; indeed, I gathered from Marama and\r\nother Orofenans that such convulsions had occurred on and around the\r\nisland at what must have corresponded with that moment of the loosing\r\nof the force.\r\n\r\nThis loss of our belongings in the house of the Rock of Offerings was\r\nthe more grievous because among them were some Kodak photographs which\r\nI had taken, including portraits of Oro and one of Yva that was really\r\nexcellent, to say nothing of pictures of the mouth of the cave and of\r\nthe ruins and crater lake above. How bitterly I regret that I did not\r\nkeep these photographs in my pocket with the map-plates.\r\n\r\n“Even if the star-maps are correct, still it proves nothing,” said\r\nBickley, “since possibly Oro’s astronomical skill might have enabled\r\nhim to draw that of the sky at any period, though I allow this is\r\nimpossible.”\r\n\r\n“I doubt his taking so much trouble merely to deceive three wanderers\r\nwho lacked the knowledge even to check them,” I said. “But all this\r\nmisses the point, Bickley. However long they had slept, that man and\r\nwoman did arise from seeming death. They did dwell in those marvelous\r\ncaves with their evidences of departed civilisations, and they did show\r\nus that fearful, world-wandering gyroscope. These things we saw.”\r\n\r\n“I admit that we saw them, Arbuthnot, and I admit that they are one and\r\nall beyond human comprehension. To that extent I am converted, and, I\r\nmay add, humbled,” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“So you ought to be,” exclaimed Bastin, “seeing that you always swore\r\nthat there was nothing in the world that is not capable of a perfectly\r\nnatural explanation.”\r\n\r\n“Of which all these things may be capable, Bastin, if only we held the\r\nkey.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Bickley, but how do you explain what the Lady Yva did? I\r\nmay tell you now what she commanded me to conceal at the time, namely,\r\nthat she became a Christian; so much so that by her own will, I\r\nbaptised and confirmed her on the very morning of her sacrifice.\r\nDoubtless it was this that changed her heart so much that she became\r\nwilling, of course without my knowledge, to leave everything she cared\r\nfor,” here he looked hard at me, “and lay down her life to save the\r\nworld, half of which she believed was about to be drowned by Oro. Now,\r\nconsidering her history and upbringing, I call this a spiritual marvel,\r\nmuch greater than any you now admit, and one you can’t explain,\r\nBickley.”\r\n\r\n“No, I cannot explain, or, at any rate, I will not try,” he answered,\r\nalso staring hard at me. “Whatever she believed, or did not believe,\r\nand whatever would or would not have happened, she was a great and\r\nwonderful woman whose memory I worship.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so, Bickley, and now perhaps you see my point, that what you\r\ndescribe as mere vain words may also be helpful to mankind; more so,\r\nindeed, than your surgical instruments and pills.”\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t convert Oro, anyway,” exclaimed Bickley, with irritation.\r\n\r\n“No, Bickley; but then I have always understood that the devil is\r\nbeyond conversion because he is beyond repentance. You see, I think\r\nthat if that old scoundrel was not the devil himself, at any rate he\r\nwas a bit of him, and, if I am right, I am not ashamed to have failed\r\nin his case.”\r\n\r\n“Even Oro was not utterly bad, Bastin,” I said, reflecting on certain\r\ntraits of mercy that he had shown, or that I dreamed him to have shown\r\nin the course of our mysterious midnight journeys to various parts of\r\nthe earth. Also I remembered that he had loved Tommy and for his sake\r\nhad spared our lives. Lastly, I do not altogether wonder that he came\r\nto certain hasty conclusions as to the value of our modern\r\ncivilisations.\r\n\r\n“I am very glad to hear it, Humphrey, since while there is a spark left\r\nthe whole fire may burn up again, and I believe that to the Divine\r\nmercy there are no limits, though Oro will have a long road to travel\r\nbefore he finds it. And now I have something to say. It has troubled me\r\nvery much that I was obliged to leave those Orofenans wandering in a\r\nkind of religious twilight.”\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t help that,” said Bickley, “seeing that if you had\r\nstopped, by now you would have been wandering in religious light.”\r\n\r\n“Still, I am not sure that I ought not to have stopped. I seem to have\r\ndeserted a field that was open to me. However, it can’t be helped,\r\nsince it is certain that we could never find that island again, even if\r\nOro has not sunk it beneath the sea, as he is quite capable of doing,\r\nto cover his tracks, so to speak. So I mean to do my best in another\r\nfield by way of atonement.”\r\n\r\n“You are not going to become a missionary?” I said.\r\n\r\n“No, but with the consent of the Bishop, who, I think, believes that my\r\n_locum_ got on better in the parish than I do, as no doubt was the\r\ncase, I, too, have volunteered for the Front, and been accepted as a\r\nchaplain of the 201st Division.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that’s mine!” said Bickley.\r\n\r\n“Is it? I am very glad, since now we shall be able to pursue our\r\npleasant arguments and to do our best to open each other’s minds.”\r\n\r\n“You fellows are more fortunate than I am,” I remarked. “I also\r\nvolunteered, but they wouldn’t take me, even as a Tommy, although I\r\nmisstated my age. They told me, or at least a specialist whom I saw did\r\nafterwards, that the blow I got on the head from that sorcerer’s boy—”\r\n\r\n“I know, I know!” broke in Bickley almost roughly. “Of course, things\r\nmight go wrong at any time. But with care you may live to old age.”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to hear it,” I said with a sigh, “at least I think I am.\r\nMeanwhile, fortunately there is much that I can do at home; indeed a\r\ncourse of action has been suggested to me by an old friend who is now\r\nin authority.”\r\n\r\nOnce more Bickley and Bastin in their war-stained uniforms were dining\r\nat my table and on the very night of their return from the Front, which\r\nwas unexpected. Indeed Tommy nearly died of joy on hearing their voices\r\nin the hall. They, who played a worthy part in the great struggle, had\r\nmuch to tell me, and naturally their more recent experiences had\r\noverlaid to some extent those which we shared in the mysterious island\r\nof Orofena. Indeed we did not speak of these until, just as they were\r\ngoing away, Bastin paused beneath a very beautiful portrait of my late\r\nwife, the work of an artist famous for his power of bringing out the\r\ninner character, or what some might call the soul, of the sitter. He\r\nstared at it for a while in his short-sighted way, then said: “Do you\r\nknow, Arbuthnot, it has sometimes occurred to me, and never more than\r\nat this moment, that although they were different in height and so on,\r\nthere was a really curious physical resemblance between your late wife\r\nand the Lady Yva.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered. “I think so too.”\r\n\r\nBickley also examined the portrait very carefully, and as he did so I\r\nsaw him start. Then he turned away, saying nothing.\r\n\r\nSuch is the summary of all that has been important in my life. It is, I\r\nadmit, an odd story and one which suggests problems that I cannot\r\nsolve. Bastin deals with such things by that acceptance which is the\r\nprivilege and hall-mark of faith; Bickley disposes, or used to dispose,\r\nof them by a blank denial which carries no conviction, and least of all\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\nWhat is life to most of us who, like Bickley, think ourselves learned?\r\nA round, short but still with time and to spare wherein to be dull and\r\nlonesome; a fateful treadmill to which we were condemned we know not\r\nhow, but apparently through the casual passions of those who went\r\nbefore us and are now forgotten, causing us, as the Bible says, to be\r\nborn in sin; up which we walk wearily we know not why, seeming never to\r\nmake progress; off which we fall outworn we know not when or whither.\r\n\r\nSuch upon the surface it appears to be, nor in fact does our\r\nascertained knowledge, as Bickley would sum it up, take us much\r\nfurther. No prophet has yet arisen who attempted to define either the\r\norigin or the reasons of life. Even the very Greatest of them Himself\r\nis quite silent on this matter. We are tempted to wonder why. Is it\r\nbecause life as expressed in the higher of human beings, is, or will be\r\ntoo vast, too multiform and too glorious for any definition which we\r\ncould understand? Is it because in the end it will involve for some, if\r\nnot for all, majesty on unfathomed majesty, and glory upon unimaginable\r\nglory such as at present far outpass the limits of our thought?\r\n\r\nThe experiences which I have recorded in these pages awake in my heart\r\na hope that this may be so. Bastin is wont, like many others, to talk\r\nin a light fashion of Eternity without in the least comprehending what\r\nhe means by that gigantic term. It is not too much to say that\r\nEternity, something without beginning and without end, and involving,\r\nit would appear, an everlasting changelessness, is a state beyond human\r\ncomprehension. As a matter of fact we mortals do not think in\r\nconstellations, so to speak, or in æons, but by the measures of our own\r\nsmall earth and of our few days thereon. We cannot really conceive of\r\nan existence stretching over even one thousand years, such as that\r\nwhich Oro claimed and the Bible accords to a certain early race of men,\r\nomitting of course his two thousand five hundred centuries of sleep.\r\nAnd yet what is this but one grain in the hourglass of time, one day in\r\nthe lost record of our earth, of its sisters the planets and its father\r\nthe sun, to say nothing of the universes beyond?\r\n\r\nIt is because I have come in touch with a prolonged though perfectly\r\nfinite existence of the sort, that I try to pass on the reflections\r\nwhich the fact of it awoke in me. There are other reflections connected\r\nwith Yva and the marvel of her love and its various manifestations\r\nwhich arise also. But these I keep to myself. They concern the wonder\r\nof woman’s heart, which is a microcosm of the hopes and fears and\r\ndesires and despairs of this humanity of ours whereof from age to age\r\nshe is the mother.\r\n\r\nHUMPHREY ARBUTHNOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE By J. R. Bickley, M.R.C.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin about six months of the date on which he wrote the last words of\r\nthis history of our joint adventures, my dear friend, Humphrey\r\nArbuthnot, died suddenly, as I had foreseen that probably he would do,\r\nfrom the results of the injury he received in the island of Orofena.\r\n\r\nHe left me the sole executor to his will, under which he divided his\r\nproperty into three parts. One third he bequeathed to me, one third\r\n(which is strictly tied up) to Bastin, and one third to be devoted,\r\nunder my direction, to the advancement of Science.\r\n\r\nHis end appears to have been instantaneous, resulting from an effusion\r\nof blood upon the brain. When I was summoned I found him lying dead by\r\nthe writing desk in his library at Fulcombe Priory. He had been writing\r\nat the desk, for on it was a piece of paper on which appear these\r\nwords: “_I have seen her. I_—” There the writing ends, not stating whom\r\nhe thought he had seen in the moments of mental disturbance or delusion\r\nwhich preceded his decease.\r\n\r\nSave for certain verbal corrections, I publish this manuscript without\r\ncomment as the will directs, only adding that it sets out our mutual\r\nexperiences very faithfully, though Arbuthnot’s deductions from them\r\nare not always my own.\r\n\r\nI would say also that I am contemplating another visit to the South Sea\r\nIslands, where I wish to make some further investigations. I dare say,\r\nhowever, that these will be barren of results, as the fountain of\r\nLife-water is buried for ever, nor, as I think, will any human being\r\nstand again in the Hades-like halls of Nyo. It is probable also that it\r\nwould prove impossible to rediscover the island of Orofena, if indeed\r\nthat volcanic land still remains above the waters of the deep.\r\n\r\nNow that he is a very wealthy man, Bastin talks of accompanying me for\r\npurposes quite different from my own, but on the whole I hope he will\r\nabandon this idea. I may add that when he learned of his unexpected\r\ninheritance he talked much of the “deceitfulness of riches,” but that\r\nhe has not as yet taken any steps to escape their golden snare. Indeed\r\nhe now converses of his added “opportunities of usefulness,” I gather\r\nin connection with missionary enterprise.\r\n\r\nJ. R. BICKLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_P.S_.—I forgot to state that the spaniel Tommy died within three days\r\nof his owner. The poor little beast was present in the room at the time\r\nof Arbuthnot’s passing away, and when found seemed to be suffering from\r\nshock. From that moment Tommy refused food and finally was discovered\r\nquite dead and lying by the body on Marama’s feather cloak, which\r\nArbuthnot often used as a dressing-gown. As Bastin raised some\r\nreligious objections, I arranged without his knowledge that the dog’s\r\nashes should rest not far from those of the master and mistress whom it\r\nloved so well.\r\n\r\nJ.R.B.",
