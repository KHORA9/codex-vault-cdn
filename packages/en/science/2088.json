LYELL TO CHARLES DARWIN. (Part of this letter is given in the 'Life\r\nof Sir Charles Lyell,' volume ii. page 325.) October 3d, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI have just finished your volume and right glad I am that I did my best\r\nwith Hooker to persuade you to publish it without waiting for a time\r\nwhich probably could never have arrived, though you lived till the age\r\nof a hundred, when you had prepared all your facts on which you ground\r\nso many grand generalizations.\r\n\r\nIt is a splendid case of close reasoning, and long substantial argument\r\nthroughout so many pages; the condensation immense, too great perhaps\r\nfor the uninitiated, but an effective and important preliminary\r\nstatement, which will admit, even before your detailed proofs appear,\r\nof some occasional useful exemplification, such as your pigeons and\r\ncirripedes, of which you make such excellent use.\r\n\r\nI mean that, when, as I fully expect, a new edition is soon called for,\r\nyou may here and there insert an actual case to relieve the vast\r\nnumber of abstract propositions. So far as I am concerned, I am so well\r\nprepared to take your statements of facts for granted, that I do\r\nnot think the \"pieces justificatives\" when published will make much\r\ndifference, and I have long seen most clearly that if any concession\r\nis made, all that you claim in your concluding pages will follow. It is\r\nthis which has made me so long hesitate, always feeling that the case of\r\nMan and his races, and of other animals, and that of plants is one and\r\nthe same, and that if a \"vera causa\" be admitted for one, instead of a\r\npurely unknown and imaginary one, such as the word \"Creation,\" all the\r\nconsequences must follow.\r\n\r\nI fear I have not time to-day, as I am just leaving this place, to\r\nindulge in a variety of comments, and to say how much I was delighted\r\nwith Oceanic Islands--Rudimentary Organs--Embryology--the genealogical\r\nkey to the Natural System, Geographical Distribution, and if I went on I\r\nshould be copying the heads of all your chapters. But I will say a word\r\nof the Recapitulation, in case some slight alteration, or at least,\r\nomission of a word or two be still possible in that.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, at page 480, it cannot surely be said that the most\r\neminent naturalists have rejected the view of the mutability of species?\r\nYou do not mean to ignore G. St. Hilaire and Lamarck. As to the latter,\r\nyou may say, that in regard to animals you substitute natural selection\r\nfor volition to a certain considerable extent, but in his theory of the\r\nchanges of plants he could not introduce volition; he may, no doubt,\r\nhave laid an undue comparative stress on changes in physical conditions,\r\nand too little on those of contending organisms. He at least was for the\r\nuniversal mutability of species and for a genealogical link between\r\nthe first and the present. The men of his school also appealed to\r\ndomesticated varieties. (Do you mean LIVING naturalists?) (In the\r\npublished copies of the first edition, page 480, the words are \"eminent\r\nliving naturalists.\")\r\n\r\nThe first page of this most important summary gives the adversary an\r\nadvantage, by putting forth so abruptly and crudely such a startling\r\nobjection as the formation of \"the eye,\" not by means analogous to man's\r\nreason, or rather by some power immeasurably superior to human reason,\r\nbut by superinduced variation like those of which a cattle-breeder\r\navails himself. Pages would be required thus to state an objection and\r\nremove it. It would be better, as you wish to persuade, to say nothing.\r\nLeave out several sentences, and in a future edition bring it out more\r\nfully. Between the throwing down of such a stumbling-block in the way of\r\nthe reader, and the passage to the working ants, in page 460, there\r\nare pages required; and these ants are a bathos to him before he has\r\nrecovered from the shock of being called upon to believe the eye to have\r\nbeen brought to perfection, from a state of blindness or purblindness,\r\nby such variations as we witness. I think a little omission would\r\ngreatly lessen the objectionableness of these sentences if you have not\r\ntime to recast and amplify.\r\n\r\n... But these are small matters, mere spots on the sun. Your comparison\r\nof the letters retained in words, when no longer wanted for the sound,\r\nto rudimentary organs is excellent, as both are truly genealogical.\r\n\r\nThe want of peculiar birds in Madeira is a greater difficulty than\r\nseemed to me allowed for. I could cite passages where you show that\r\nvariations are superinduced from the new circumstances of new colonists,\r\nwhich would require some Madeira birds, like those of the Galapagos, to\r\nbe peculiar. There has been ample time in the case of Madeira and Porto\r\nSanto...\r\n\r\nYou enclose your sheets in old MS., so the Post Office very properly\r\ncharge them as letters, 2 pence extra. I wish all their fines on MS.\r\nwere worth as much. I paid 4 shillings 6 pence for such wash the other\r\nday from Paris, from a man who can prove 300 deluges in the valley of\r\nthe Seine.\r\n\r\nWith my hearty congratulations to you on your grand work, believe me,\r\n\r\nEver very affectionately yours, CHAS. LYELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Ilkley, Yorkshire, October 11th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI thank you cordially for giving me so much of your valuable time in\r\nwriting me the long letter of 3d, and still longer of 4th. I wrote a\r\nline with the missing proof-sheet to Scarborough. I have adopted most\r\nthankfully all your minor corrections in the last chapter, and the\r\ngreater ones as far as I could with little trouble. I damped the opening\r\npassage about the eye (in my bigger work I show the gradations in\r\nstructure of the eye) by putting merely \"complex organs.\" But you are a\r\npretty Lord Chancellor to tell the barrister on one side how best to\r\nwin the cause! The omission of \"living\" before eminent naturalists was a\r\ndreadful blunder.\r\n\r\nMADEIRA AND BERMUDA BIRDS NOT PECULIAR.\r\n\r\nYou are right, there is a screw out here; I thought no one would have\r\ndetected it; I blundered in omitting a discussion, which I have written\r\nout in full. But once for all, let me say as an excuse, that it was most\r\ndifficult to decide what to omit. Birds, which have struggled in their\r\nown homes, when settled in a body, nearly simultaneously in a new\r\ncountry, would not be subject to much modification, for their mutual\r\nrelations would not be much disturbed. But I quite agree with you, that\r\nin time they ought to undergo some. In Bermuda and Madeira they have, as\r\nI believe, been kept constant by the frequent arrival, and the crossing\r\nwith unaltered immigrants of the same species from the mainland. In\r\nBermuda this can be proved, in Madeira highly probable, as shown me\r\nby letters from E.V. Harcourt. Moreover, there are ample grounds for\r\nbelieving that the crossed offspring of the new immigrants (fresh blood\r\nas breeders would say), and old colonists of the same species would\r\nbe extra vigorous, and would be the most likely to survive; thus the\r\neffects of such crossing in keeping the old colonists unaltered would be\r\nmuch aided.\r\n\r\nON GALAPAGOS PRODUCTIONS HAVING AMERICAN TYPE ON VIEW OF CREATION.\r\n\r\nI cannot agree with you, that species if created to struggle with\r\nAmerican forms, would have to be created on the American type. Facts\r\npoint diametrically the other way. Look at the unbroken and untilled\r\nground in La Plata, COVERED with European products, which have no near\r\naffinity to the indigenous products. They are not American types which\r\nconquer the aborigines. So in every island throughout the world. Alph.\r\nDe Candolle's results (though he does not see its full importance), that\r\nthoroughly well naturalised [plants] are in general very different from\r\nthe aborigines (belonging in large proportion of cases to non-indigenous\r\ngenera) is most important always to bear in mind. Once for all, I am\r\nsure, you will understand that I thus write dogmatically for brevity\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nON THE CONTINUED CREATION Of MONADS.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is superfluous (and groundless) on the theory of Natural\r\nSelection, which implies no NECESSARY tendency to progression. A monad,\r\nif no deviation in its structure profitable to it under its EXCESSIVELY\r\nSIMPLE conditions of life occurred, might remain unaltered from long\r\nbefore the Silurian Age to the present day. I grant there will generally\r\nbe a tendency to advance in complexity of organisation, though in beings\r\nfitted for very simple conditions it would be slight and slow. How could\r\na complex organisation profit a monad? if it did not profit it there\r\nwould be no advance. The Secondary Infusoria differ but little from the\r\nliving. The parent monad form might perfectly well survive unaltered\r\nand fitted for its simple conditions, whilst the offspring of this\r\nvery monad might become fitted for more complex conditions. The one\r\nprimordial prototype of all living and extinct creatures may, it is\r\npossible, be now alive! Moreover, as you say, higher forms might be\r\noccasionally degraded, the snake Typhlops SEEMS (?!) to have the habits\r\nof earth-worms. So that fresh creatures of simple forms seem to me\r\nwholly superfluous.\r\n\r\n\"MUST YOU NOT ASSUME A PRIMEVAL CREATIVE POWER WHICH DOES NOT ACT WITH\r\nUNIFORMITY, OR HOW COULD MAN SUPERVENE?\"\r\n\r\nI am not sure that I understand your remarks which follow the above.\r\nWe must under present knowledge assume the creation of one or of a few\r\nforms in the same manner as philosophers assume the existence of a power\r\nof attraction without any explanation. But I entirely reject, as in my\r\njudgment quite unnecessary, any subsequent addition \"of new powers and\r\nattributes and forces;\" or of any \"principle of improvement,\" except in\r\nso far as every character which is naturally selected or preserved is in\r\nsome way an advantage or improvement, otherwise it would not have been\r\nselected. If I were convinced that I required such additions to the\r\ntheory of natural selection, I would reject it as rubbish, but I have\r\nfirm faith in it, as I cannot believe, that if false, it would explain\r\nso many whole classes of facts, which, if I am in my senses, it seems\r\nto explain. As far as I understand your remarks and illustrations, you\r\ndoubt the possibility of gradations of intellectual powers. Now, it\r\nseems to me, looking to existing animals alone, that we have a very fine\r\ngradation in the intellectual powers of the Vertebrata, with one rather\r\nwide gap (not half so wide as in many cases of corporeal structure),\r\nbetween say a Hottentot and a Ourang, even if civilised as much mentally\r\nas the dog has been from the wolf. I suppose that you do not doubt that\r\nthe intellectual powers are as important for the welfare of each being\r\nas corporeal structure; if so, I can see no difficulty in the most\r\nintellectual individuals of a species being continually selected;\r\nand the intellect of the new species thus improved, aided probably by\r\neffects of inherited mental exercise. I look at this process as now\r\ngoing on with the races of man; the less intellectual races being\r\nexterminated. But there is not space to discuss this point. If I\r\nunderstand you, the turning-point in our difference must be, that you\r\nthink it impossible that the intellectual powers of a species should\r\nbe much improved by the continued natural selection of the most\r\nintellectual individuals. To show how minds graduate, just reflect how\r\nimpossible every one has yet found it, to define the difference in mind\r\nof man and the lower animals; the latter seem to have the very same\r\nattributes in a much lower stage of perfection than the lowest savage. I\r\nwould give absolutely nothing for the theory of Natural Selection, if\r\nit requires miraculous additions at any one stage of descent. I think\r\nEmbryology, Homology, Classification, etc., etc., show us that all\r\nvertebrata have descended from one parent; how that parent appeared we\r\nknow not. If you admit in ever so little a degree, the explanation which\r\nI have given of Embryology, Homology and Classification, you will\r\nfind it difficult to say: thus far the explanation holds good, but no\r\nfurther; here we must call in \"the addition of new creative forces.\"\r\nI think you will be driven to reject all or admit all: I fear by your\r\nletter it will be the former alternative; and in that case I shall feel\r\nsure it is my fault, and not the theory's fault, and this will certainly\r\ncomfort me. With regard to the descent of the great Kingdoms (as\r\nVertebrata, Articulata, etc.) from one parent, I have said in the\r\nconclusion, that mere analogy makes me think it probable; my arguments\r\nand facts are sound in my judgment only for each separate kingdom.\r\n\r\nTHE FORMS WHICH ARE BEATEN INHERITING SOME INFERIORITY IN COMMON.\r\n\r\nI dare say I have not been guarded enough, but might not the term\r\ninferiority include less perfect adaptation to physical conditions?\r\n\r\nMy remarks apply not to single species, but to groups or genera; the\r\nspecies of most genera are adapted at least to rather hotter, and rather\r\nless hot, to rather damper and dryer climates; and when the several\r\nspecies of a group are beaten and exterminated by the several species of\r\nanother group, it will not, I think, generally be from EACH new species\r\nbeing adapted to the climate, but from all the new species having some\r\ncommon advantage in obtaining sustenance, or escaping enemies. As groups\r\nare concerned, a fairer illustration than negro and white in Liberia\r\nwould be the almost certain future extinction of the genus ourang by\r\nthe genus man, not owing to man being better fitted for the climate, but\r\nowing to the inherited intellectual inferiority of the Ourang-genus\r\nto Man-genus, by his intellect, inventing fire-arms and cutting\r\ndown forests. I believe from reasons given in my discussion, that\r\nacclimatisation is readily effected under nature. It has taken me\r\nso many years to disabuse my mind of the TOO great importance of\r\nclimate--its important influence being so conspicuous, whilst that of a\r\nstruggle between creature and creature is so hidden--that I am inclined\r\nto swear at the North Pole, and, as Sydney Smith said, even to speak\r\ndisrespectfully of the Equator. I beg you often to reflect (I have found\r\nNOTHING so instructive) on the case of thousands of plants in the middle\r\npoint of their respective ranges, and which, as we positively know, can\r\nperfectly well withstand a little more heat and cold, a little more damp\r\nand dry, but which in the metropolis of their range do not exist in vast\r\nnumbers, although if many of the other inhabitants were destroyed [they]\r\nwould cover the ground. We thus clearly see that their numbers are kept\r\ndown, in almost every case, not by climate, but by the struggle with\r\nother organisms. All this you will perhaps think very obvious; but,\r\nuntil I repeated it to myself thousands of times, I took, as I believe,\r\na wholly wrong view of the whole economy of nature...\r\n\r\nHYBRIDISM.\r\n\r\nI am so much pleased that you approve of this chapter; you would be\r\nastonished at the labour this cost me; so often was I, on what I believe\r\nwas, the wrong scent.\r\n\r\nRUDIMENTARY ORGANS.\r\n\r\nOn the theory of Natural Selection there is a wide distinction between\r\nRudimentary Organs and what you call germs of organs, and what I call\r\nin my bigger book \"nascent\" organs. An organ should not be called\r\nrudimentary unless it be useless--as teeth which never cut through the\r\ngums--the papillae, representing the pistil in male flowers, wing of\r\nApteryx, or better, the little wings under soldered elytra. These organs\r\nare now plainly useless, and a fortiori, they would be useless in a\r\nless developed state. Natural Selection acts exclusively by preserving\r\nsuccessive slight, USEFUL modifications. Hence Natural Selection cannot\r\npossibly make a useless or rudimentary organ. Such organs are solely due\r\nto inheritance (as explained in my discussion), and plainly bespeak an\r\nancestor having the organ in a useful condition. They may be, and\r\noften have been, worked in for other purposes, and then they are only\r\nrudimentary for the original function, which is sometimes plainly\r\napparent. A nascent organ, though little developed, as it has to be\r\ndeveloped must be useful in every stage of development. As we cannot\r\nprophesy, we cannot tell what organs are now nascent; and nascent organs\r\nwill rarely have been handed down by certain members of a class from a\r\nremote period to the present day, for beings with any important organ\r\nbut little developed, will generally have been supplanted by their\r\ndescendants with the organ well developed. The mammary glands in\r\nOrnithorhynchus may, perhaps, be considered as nascent compared with\r\nthe udders of a cow--Ovigerous frena, in certain cirripedes, are nascent\r\nbranchiae--in [illegible] the swim bladder is almost rudimentary for\r\nthis purpose, and is nascent as a lung. The small wing of penguin, used\r\nonly as a fin, might be nascent as a wing; not that I think so; for\r\nthe whole structure of the bird is adapted for flight, and a penguin\r\nso closely resembles other birds, that we may infer that its wings have\r\nprobably been modified, and reduced by natural selection, in accordance\r\nwith its sub-aquatic habits. Analogy thus often serves as a guide in\r\ndistinguishing whether an organ is rudimentary or nascent. I believe the\r\nOs coccyx gives attachment to certain muscles, but I can not doubt that\r\nit is a rudimentary tail. The bastard wing of birds is a rudimentary\r\ndigit; and I believe that if fossil birds are found very low down in the\r\nseries, they will be seen to have a double or bifurcated wing. Here is a\r\nbold prophecy!\r\n\r\nTo admit prophetic germs, is tantamount to rejecting the theory of\r\nNatural Selection.\r\n\r\nI am very glad you think it worth while to run through my book again, as\r\nmuch, or more, for the subject's sake as for my own sake. But I look at\r\nyour keeping the subject for some little time before your mind--raising\r\nyour own difficulties and solving them--as far more important than\r\nreading my book. If you think enough, I expect you will be perverted,\r\nand if you ever are, I shall know that the theory of Natural Selection,\r\nis, in the main, safe; that it includes, as now put forth, many errors,\r\nis almost certain, though I cannot see them. Do not, of course, think of\r\nanswering this; but if you have other OCCASION to write again, just\r\nsay whether I have, in ever so slight a degree, shaken any of your\r\nobjections. Farewell. With my cordial thanks for your long letters and\r\nvaluable remarks,\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--You often allude to Lamarck's work; I do not know what you think\r\nabout it, but it appeared to me extremely poor; I got not a fact or idea\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO L. AGASSIZ. (Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz, born at\r\nMortier, on the lake of Morat in Switzerland, on May 28, 1807. He\r\nemigrated to America in 1846, where he spent the rest of his life, and\r\ndied December 14, 1873. His 'Life,' written by his widow, was published\r\nin 1885. The following extract from a letter to Agassiz (1850) is worth\r\ngiving, as showing how my father regarded him, and it may be added that\r\nhis cordial feelings towards the great American naturalist remained\r\nstrong to the end of his life:--\r\n\r\n\"I have seldom been more deeply gratified than by receiving your most\r\nkind present of 'Lake Superior.' I had heard of it, and had much wished\r\nto read it, but I confess that it was the very great honour of having in\r\nmy possession a work with your autograph as a presentation copy that has\r\ngiven me such lively and sincere pleasure. I cordially thank you for\r\nit. I have begun to read it with uncommon interest, which I see will\r\nincrease as I go on.\") Down, November 11th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have ventured to send you a copy of my book (as yet only an abstract)\r\non the 'Origin of Species.' As the conclusions at which I have arrived\r\non several points differ so widely from yours, I have thought (should\r\nyou at any time read my volume) that you might think that I had sent it\r\nto you out of a spirit of defiance or bravado; but I assure you that\r\nI act under a wholly different frame of mind. I hope that you will at\r\nleast give me credit, however erroneous you may think my conclusions,\r\nfor having earnestly endeavoured to arrive at the truth. With sincere\r\nrespect, I beg leave to remain,\r\n\r\nYours, very faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A. DE CANDOLLE. Down, November 11th [1859].\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have thought that you would permit me to send you (by Messrs. Williams\r\nand Norgate, booksellers) a copy of my work (as yet only an abstract)\r\non the 'Origin of Species.' I wish to do this, as the only, though quite\r\ninadequate manner, by which I can testify to you the extreme interest\r\nwhich I have felt, and the great advantage which I have derived, from\r\nstudying your grand and noble work on Geographical Distribution. Should\r\nyou be induced to read my volume, I venture to remark that it will be\r\nintelligible only by reading the whole straight through, as it is very\r\nmuch condensed. It would be a high gratification to me if any portion\r\ninterested you. But I am perfectly well aware that you will entirely\r\ndisagree with the conclusion at which I have arrived.\r\n\r\nYou will probably have quite forgotten me; but many years ago you did\r\nme the honour of dining at my house in London to meet M. and Madame\r\nSismondi (Jessie Allen, sister of Mrs. Josiah Wedgwood of Maer.), the\r\nuncle and aunt of my wife. With sincere respect, I beg to remain,\r\n\r\nYours, very faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO HUGH FALCONER. Down, November 11th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Falconer,\r\n\r\nI have told Murray to send you a copy of my book on the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies,' which as yet is only an abstract.\r\n\r\nIf you read it, you must read it straight through, otherwise from its\r\nextremely condensed state it will be unintelligible.\r\n\r\nLord, how savage you will be, if you read it, and how you will long to\r\ncrucify me alive! I fear it will produce no other effect on you; but\r\nif it should stagger you in ever so slight a degree, in this case, I\r\nam fully convinced that you will become, year after year, less fixed\r\nin your belief in the immutability of species. With this audacious and\r\npresumptuous conviction,\r\n\r\nI remain, my dear Falconer, Yours most truly, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, November 11th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI have directed a copy of my book (as yet only an abstract) on the\r\n'Origin of Species' to be sent you. I know how you are pressed for time;\r\nbut if you can read it, I shall be infinitely gratified...If ever you do\r\nread it, and can screw out time to send me (as I value your opinion so\r\nhighly), however short a note, telling me what you think its weakest and\r\nbest parts, I should be extremely grateful. As you are not a geologist,\r\nyou will excuse my conceit in telling you that Lyell highly approves of\r\nthe two Geological chapters, and thinks that on the Imperfection of the\r\nGeological Record not exaggerated. He is nearly a convert to my views...\r\n\r\nLet me add I fully admit that there are very many difficulties not\r\nsatisfactorily explained by my theory of descent with modification,\r\nbut I cannot possibly believe that a false theory would explain so many\r\nclasses of facts as I think it certainly does explain. On these\r\ngrounds I drop my anchor, and believe that the difficulties will slowly\r\ndisappear...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Down, November 11th, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Henslow,\r\n\r\nI have told Murray to send a copy of my book on Species to you, my\r\ndear old master in Natural History; I fear, however, that you will not\r\napprove of your pupil in this case. The book in its present state does\r\nnot show the amount of labour which I have bestowed on the subject.\r\n\r\nIf you have time to read it carefully, and would take the trouble to\r\npoint out what parts seem weakest to you and what best, it would be\r\na most material aid to me in writing my bigger book, which I hope\r\nto commence in a few months. You know also how highly I value your\r\njudgment. But I am not so unreasonable as to wish or expect you to\r\nwrite detailed and lengthy criticisms, but merely a few general remarks,\r\npointing out the weakest parts.\r\n\r\nIf you are IN EVEN SO SLIGHT A DEGREE staggered (which I hardly expect)\r\non the immutability of species, then I am convinced with further\r\nreflection you will become more and more staggered, for this has been\r\nthe process through which my mind has gone. My dear Henslow,\r\n\r\nYours affectionately and gratefully, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO JOHN LUBBOCK. (The present Sir John Lubbock.) Ilkley,\r\nYorkshire, Saturday [November 12th, 1859].\r\n\r\n... Thank you much for asking me to Brighton. I hope much that you will\r\nenjoy your holiday. I have told Murray to send a copy for you to Mansion\r\nHouse Street, and I am surprised that you have not received it. There\r\nare so many valid and weighty arguments against my notions, that you,\r\nor any one, if you wish on the other side, will easily persuade yourself\r\nthat I am wholly in error, and no doubt I am in part in error, perhaps\r\nwholly so, though I cannot see the blindness of my ways. I dare say when\r\nthunder and lightning were first proved to be due to secondary causes,\r\nsome regretted to give up the idea that each flash was caused by the\r\ndirect hand of God.\r\n\r\nFarewell, I am feeling very unwell to-day, so no more.\r\n\r\nYours very truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO JOHN LUBBOCK. Ilkley, Yorkshire, Tuesday [November\r\n15th, 1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lubbock,\r\n\r\nI beg pardon for troubling you again. I do not know how I blundered\r\nin expressing myself in making you believe that we accepted your kind\r\ninvitation to Brighton. I meant merely to thank you sincerely for\r\nwishing to see such a worn-out old dog as myself. I hardly know when we\r\nleave this place,--not under a fortnight, and then we shall wish to rest\r\nunder our own roof-tree.\r\n\r\nI do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's 'Natural\r\nTheology.' I could almost formerly have said it by heart.\r\n\r\nI am glad you have got my book, but I fear that you value it far too\r\nhighly. I should be grateful for any criticisms. I care not for Reviews;\r\nbut for the opinion of men like you and Hooker and Huxley and Lyell,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nFarewell, with our joint thanks to Mrs. Lubbock and yourself. Adios.\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO L. JENYNS. (Now Rev. L. Blomefield.) Ilkley,\r\nYorkshire, November 13th, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Jenyns,\r\n\r\nI must thank you for your very kind note forwarded to me from Down. I\r\nhave been much out of health this summer, and have been hydropathising\r\nhere for the last six weeks with very little good as yet. I shall stay\r\nhere for another fortnight at least. Please remember that my book\r\nis only an abstract, and very much condensed, and, to be at all\r\nintelligible, must be carefully read. I shall be very grateful for any\r\ncriticisms. But I know perfectly well that you will not at all agree\r\nwith the lengths which I go. It took long years to convert me. I may, of\r\ncourse, be egregiously wrong; but I cannot persuade myself that a theory\r\nwhich explains (as I think it certainly does) several large classes of\r\nfacts, can be wholly wrong; notwithstanding the several difficulties\r\nwhich have to be surmounted somehow, and which stagger me even to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nI wish that my health had allowed me to publish in extenso; if ever I\r\nget strong enough I will do so, as the greater part is written out, and\r\nof which MS. the present volume is an abstract.\r\n\r\nI fear this note will be almost illegible; but I am poorly, and can\r\nhardly sit up. Farewell; with thanks for your kind note and pleasant\r\nremembrance of good old days.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Ilkley, November 13th, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have told Murray to send you by post (if possible) a copy of my book,\r\nand I hope that you will receive it at nearly the same time with this\r\nnote. (N.B. I have got a bad finger, which makes me write extra badly.)\r\nIf you are so inclined, I should very much like to hear your general\r\nimpression of the book, as you have thought so profoundly on the\r\nsubject, and in so nearly the same channel with myself. I hope there\r\nwill be some little new to you, but I fear not much. Remember it is only\r\nan abstract, and very much condensed. God knows what the public will\r\nthink. No one has read it, except Lyell, with whom I have had much\r\ncorrespondence. Hooker thinks him a complete convert, but he does not\r\nseem so in his letters to me; but is evidently deeply interested in the\r\nsubject. I do not think your share in the theory will be overlooked by\r\nthe real judges, as Hooker, Lyell, Asa Gray, etc. I have heard from Mr.\r\nSlater that your paper on the Malay Archipelago has been read at the\r\nLinnean Society, and that he was EXTREMELY much interested by it.\r\n\r\nI have not seen one naturalist for six or nine months, owing to the\r\nstate of my health, and therefore I really have no news to tell you. I\r\nam writing this at Ilkley Wells, where I have been with my family for\r\nthe last six weeks, and shall stay for some few weeks longer. As yet I\r\nhave profited very little. God knows when I shall have strength for my\r\nbigger book.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that you keep your health; I suppose that you will be\r\nthinking of returning (Mr. Wallace was in the Malay Archipelago.) soon\r\nwith your magnificent collections, and still grander mental materials.\r\nYou will be puzzled how to publish. The Royal Society fund will be worth\r\nyour consideration. With every good wish, pray believe me,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S. I think that I told you before that Hooker is a complete convert.\r\nIf I can convert Huxley I shall be content.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Ilkley, Yorkshire, Wednesday [November 16th,\r\n1859].\r\n\r\n... I like the place very much, and the children have enjoyed it much,\r\nand it has done my wife good. It did H. good at first, but she has gone\r\nback again. I have had a series of calamities; first a sprained ankle,\r\nand then a badly swollen whole leg and face, much rash, and a frightful\r\nsuccession of boils--four or five at once. I have felt quite ill, and\r\nhave little faith in this \"unique crisis,\" as the doctor calls it,\r\ndoing me much good...You will probably have received, or will very soon\r\nreceive, my weariful book on species, I naturally believe it mainly\r\nincludes the truth, but you will not at all agree with me. Dr. Hooker,\r\nwhom I consider one of the best judges in Europe, is a complete convert,\r\nand he thinks Lyell is likewise; certainly, judging from Lyell's letters\r\nto me on the subject, he is deeply staggered. Farewell. If the spirit\r\nmoves you, let me have a line...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.B. CARPENTER. Ilkley, Yorkshire, November 18th\r\n[1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Carpenter,\r\n\r\nI must thank you for your letter on my own account, and if I know\r\nmyself, still more warmly for the subject's sake. As you seem to have\r\nunderstood my last chapter without reading the previous chapters, you\r\nmust have maturely and most profoundly self-thought out the subject; for\r\nI have found the most extraordinary difficulty in making even able men\r\nunderstand at what I was driving. There will be strong opposition to\r\nmy views. If I am in the main right (of course including partial errors\r\nunseen by me), the admission in my views will depend far more on\r\nmen, like yourself, with well-established reputations, than on my own\r\nwritings. Therefore, on the supposition that when you have read my\r\nvolume you think the view in the main true, I thank and honour you for\r\nbeing willing to run the chance of unpopularity by advocating the view.\r\nI know not in the least whether any one will review me in any of the\r\nReviews. I do not see how an author could enquire or interfere; but if\r\nyou are willing to review me anywhere, I am sure from the admiration\r\nwhich I have long felt and expressed for your 'Comparative Physiology,'\r\nthat your review will be excellently done, and will do good service in\r\nthe cause for which I think I am not selfishly deeply interested. I\r\nam feeling very unwell to-day, and this note is badly, perhaps hardly\r\nintelligibly, expressed; but you must excuse me, for I could not let a\r\npost pass, without thanking you for your note. You will have a tough\r\njob even to shake in the slightest degree Sir H. Holland. I do not think\r\n(privately I say it) that the great man has knowledge enough to enter on\r\nthe subject. Pray believe me with sincerity, Yours truly obliged,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--As you are not a practical geologist, let me add that Lyell\r\nthinks the chapter on the Imperfection of the Geological Record NOT\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.B. CARPENTER. Ilkley, Yorkshire, November 19th\r\n[1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Carpenter,\r\n\r\nI beg pardon for troubling you again. If, after reading my book, you are\r\nable to come to a conclusion in any degree definite, will you think me\r\nvery unreasonable in asking you to let me hear from you. I do not ask\r\nfor a long discussion, but merely for a brief idea of your general\r\nimpression. From your widely extended knowledge, habit of investigating\r\nthe truth, and abilities, I should value your opinion in the very\r\nhighest rank. Though I, of course, believe in the truth of my own\r\ndoctrine, I suspect that no belief is vivid until shared by others.\r\nAs yet I know only one believer, but I look at him as of the greatest\r\nauthority, viz., Hooker. When I think of the many cases of men who have\r\nstudied one subject for years, and have persuaded themselves of the\r\ntruth of the foolishest doctrines, I feel sometimes a little frightened,\r\nwhether I may not be one of these mon-maniacs.\r\n\r\nAgain pray excuse this, I fear, unreasonable request. A short note would\r\nsuffice, and I could bear a hostile verdict, and shall have to bear many\r\na one.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Ilkley, Yorkshire, Sunday [November\r\n1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have just read a review on my book in the \"Athenaeum\" (November 19,\r\n1859.), and it excites my curiosity much who is the author. If you\r\nshould hear who writes in the \"Athenaeum\" I wish you would tell me. It\r\nseems to me well done, but the reviewer gives no new objections, and,\r\nbeing hostile, passes over every single argument in favour of the\r\ndoctrine,... I fear from the tone of the review, that I have written in\r\na conceited and cocksure style (The Reviewer speaks of the author's\r\n\"evident self-satisfaction,\" and of his disposing of all difficulties\r\n\"more or less confidently.\"), which shames me a little. There is another\r\nreview of which I should like to know the author, viz., of H.C. Watson\r\nin the \"Gardener's Chronicle\". Some of the remarks are like yours, and\r\nhe does deserve punishment; but surely the review is too severe. Don't\r\nyou think so?\r\n\r\nI hope you got the three copies for Foreign Botanists in time for your\r\nparcel, and your own copy. I have heard from Carpenter, who, I think, is\r\nlikely to be a convert. Also from Quatrefages, who is inclined to go\r\na long way with us. He says that he exhibited in his lecture a diagram\r\nclosely like mine!\r\n\r\nI shall stay here one fortnight more, and then go to Down, staying on\r\nthe road at Shrewsbury a week. I have been very unfortunate: out of\r\nseven weeks I have been confined for five to the house. This has been\r\nbad for me, as I have not been able to help thinking to a foolish extent\r\nabout my book. If some four or five GOOD men came round nearly to our\r\nview, I shall not fear ultimate success. I long to learn what Huxley\r\nthinks. Is your introduction (Introduction to the 'Flora of Australia.')\r\npublished? I suppose that you will sell it separately. Please answer\r\nthis, for I want an extra copy to send away to Wallace. I am very\r\nbothersome, farewell.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI was very glad to see the Royal Medal for Mr. Bentham.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 21st, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nPray give my thanks to Mrs. Hooker for her extremely kind note, which\r\nhas pleased me much. We are very sorry she cannot come here, but shall\r\nbe delighted to see you and W. (our boys will be at home) here in the\r\n2nd week of January, or any other time. I shall much enjoy discussing\r\nany points in my book with you...\r\n\r\nI hate to hear you abuse your own work. I, on the contrary, so sincerely\r\nvalue all that you have written. It is an old and firm conviction of\r\nmine, that the Naturalists who accumulate facts and make many partial\r\ngeneralisations are the REAL benefactors of science. Those who merely\r\naccumulate facts I cannot very much respect.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to have come up for the Club to-morrow, but very much doubt\r\nwhether I shall be able. Ilkley seems to have done me no essential good.\r\nI attended the Bench on Monday, and was detained in adjudicating some\r\ntroublesome cases 1 1/2 hours longer than usual, and came home utterly\r\nknocked up, and cannot rally. I am not worth an old button... Many thanks\r\nfor your pleasant note.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I feel confident that for the future progress of the subject of\r\nthe origin and manner of formation of species, the assent and arguments\r\nand facts of working naturalists, like yourself, are far more important\r\nthan my own book; so for God's sake do not abuse your Introduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.C. WATSON TO CHARLES DARWIN. Thames Ditton, November 21st [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nOnce commenced to read the 'Origin,' I could not rest till I had\r\ngalloped through the whole. I shall now begin to re-read it more\r\ndeliberately. Meantime I am tempted to write you the first\r\nimpressions, not doubting that they will, in the main, be the permanent\r\nimpressions:--\r\n\r\n1st. Your leading idea will assuredly become recognised as an\r\nestablished truth in science, i.e. \"Natural Selection.\" It has the\r\ncharacteristics of all great natural truths, clarifying what was\r\nobscure, simplifying what was intricate, adding greatly to previous\r\nknowledge. You are the greatest revolutionist in natural history of this\r\ncentury, if not of all centuries.\r\n\r\n2nd. You will perhaps need, in some degree, to limit or modify,\r\npossibly in some degree also to extend, your present applications of the\r\nprinciple of natural selection. Without going to matters of more detail,\r\nit strikes me that there is one considerable primary inconsistency, by\r\none failure in the analogy between varieties and species; another by a\r\nsort of barrier assumed for nature on insufficient grounds and arising\r\nfrom \"divergence.\" These may, however, be faults in my own mind,\r\nattributable to yet incomplete perception of your views. And I had\r\nbetter not trouble you about them before again reading the volume.\r\n\r\n3rd. Now these novel views are brought fairly before the scientific\r\npublic, it seems truly remarkable how so many of them could have failed\r\nto see their right road sooner. How could Sir C. Lyell, for instance,\r\nfor thirty years read, write, and think, on the subject of species AND\r\nTHEIR SUCCESSION, and yet constantly look down the wrong road!\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century ago, you and I must have been in something like\r\nthe same state of mind on the main question, but you were able to see\r\nand work out the quo modo of the succession, the all-important thing,\r\nwhile I failed to grasp it. I send by this post a little controversial\r\npamphlet of old date--Combe and Scott. If you will take the trouble\r\nto glance at the passages scored on the margin, you will see that, a\r\nquarter of a century ago, I was also one of the few who then doubted the\r\nabsolute distinctness of species, and special creations of them. Yet I,\r\nlike the rest, failed to detect the quo modo which was reserved for your\r\npenetration to DISCOVER, and your discernment to APPLY.\r\n\r\nYou answered my query about the hiatus between Satyrus and Homo as was\r\nexpected. The obvious explanation really never occurred to me till some\r\nmonths after I had read the papers in the 'Linnean Proceedings.' The\r\nfirst species of Fere-homo (\"Almost-man.\") would soon make direct and\r\nexterminating war upon his Infra-homo cousins. The gap would thus be\r\nmade, and then go on increasing, into the present enormous and still\r\nwidening hiatus. But how greatly this, with your chronology of animal\r\nlife, will shock the ideas of many men!\r\n\r\nVery sincerely, HEWETT C. WATSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. Athenaeum, Monday [November 21st, 1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI am a sinner not to have written you ere this, if only to thank you for\r\nyour glorious book--what a mass of close reasoning on curious facts and\r\nfresh phenomena--it is capitally written, and will be very successful. I\r\nsay this on the strength of two or three plunges into as many chapters,\r\nfor I have not yet attempted to read it. Lyell, with whom we are\r\nstaying, is perfectly enchanted, and is absolutely gloating over it.\r\nI must accept your compliment to me, and acknowledgment of supposed\r\nassistance from me, as the warm tribute of affection from an honest\r\n(though deluded) man, and furthermore accept it as very pleasing to\r\nmy vanity; but, my dear fellow, neither my name nor my judgment nor my\r\nassistance deserved any such compliments, and if I am dishonest\r\nenough to be pleased with what I don't deserve, it must just pass. How\r\ndifferent the BOOK reads from the MS. I see I shall have much to talk\r\nover with you. Those lazy printers have not finished my luckless Essay;\r\nwhich, beside your book, will look like a ragged handkerchief beside a\r\nRoyal Standard...\r\n\r\nAll well, ever yours affectionately, JOS. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Ilkley, Yorkshire [November 1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI cannot help it, I must thank you for your affectionate and most kind\r\nnote. My head will be turned. By Jove, I must try and get a bit modest.\r\nI was a little chagrined by the review. (This refers to the review in\r\nthe \"Athenaeum\", November 19, 1859, where the reviewer, after touching\r\non the theological aspects of the book, leaves the author to \"the\r\nmercies of the Divinity Hall, the College, the Lecture Room, and the\r\nMuseum.\") I hope it was NOT --. As advocate, he might think himself\r\njustified in giving the argument only on one side. But the manner in\r\nwhich he drags in immortality, and sets the priests at me, and leaves me\r\nto their mercies, is base. He would, on no account, burn me, but he will\r\nget the wood ready, and tell the black beasts how to catch me... It would\r\nbe unspeakably grand if Huxley were to lecture on the subject, but I can\r\nsee this is a mere chance; Faraday might think it too unorthodox.\r\n\r\n... I had a letter from [Huxley] with such tremendous praise of my book,\r\nthat modesty (as I am trying to cultivate that difficult herb) prevents\r\nme sending it to you, which I should have liked to have done, as he is\r\nvery modest about himself.\r\n\r\nYou have cockered me up to that extent, that I now feel I can face a\r\nscore of savage reviewers. I suppose you are still with the Lyells. Give\r\nmy kindest remembrance to them. I triumph to hear that he continues to\r\napprove.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, your would-be modest friend, C.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Ilkley Wells, Yorkshire, November 23 [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nYou seemed to have worked admirably on the species question; there could\r\nnot have been a better plan than reading up on the opposite side.\r\nI rejoice profoundly that you intend admitting the doctrine of\r\nmodification in your new edition (It appears from Sir Charles Lyell's\r\npublished letters that he intended to admit the doctrine of evolution in\r\na new edition of the 'Manual,' but this was not published till 1865. He\r\nwas, however, at work on the 'Antiquity of Man' in 1860, and had already\r\ndetermined to discuss the 'Origin' at the end of the book.); nothing, I\r\nam convinced, could be more important for its success. I honour you most\r\nsincerely. To have maintained in the position of a master, one side of\r\na question for thirty years, and then deliberately give it up, is a fact\r\nto which I much doubt whether the records of science offer a parallel.\r\nFor myself, also, I rejoice profoundly; for, thinking of so many cases\r\nof men pursuing an illusion for years, often and often a cold shudder\r\nhas run through me, and I have asked myself whether I may not have\r\ndevoted my life to a phantasy. Now I look at it as morally impossible\r\nthat investigators of truth, like you and Hooker, can be wholly wrong,\r\nand therefore I rest in peace. Thank you for criticisms, which, if there\r\nbe a second edition, I will attend to. I have been thinking that if I\r\nam much execrated as an atheist, etc., whether the admission of the\r\ndoctrine of natural selection could injure your works; but I hope and\r\nthink not, for as far as I can remember, the virulence of bigotry is\r\nexpended on the first offender, and those who adopt his views are only\r\npitied as deluded, by the wise and cheerful bigots.\r\n\r\nI cannot help thinking that you overrate the importance of the multiple\r\norigin of dogs. The only difference is, that in the case of single\r\norigins, all difference of the races has originated since man\r\ndomesticated the species. In the case of multiple origins part of the\r\ndifference was produced under natural conditions. I should INFINITELY\r\nprefer the theory of single origin in all cases, if facts would permit\r\nits reception. But there seems to me some a priori improbability (seeing\r\nhow fond savages are of taming animals), that throughout all times, and\r\nthroughout all the world, that man should have domesticated one single\r\nspecies alone, of the widely distributed genus Canis. Besides this, the\r\nclose resemblance of at least three kinds of American domestic dogs\r\nto wild species still inhabiting the countries where they are now\r\ndomesticated, seem to almost compel admission that more than one wild\r\nCanis has been domesticated by man.\r\n\r\nI thank you cordially for all the generous zeal and interest you have\r\nshown about my book, and I remain, my dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate friend and disciple, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nSir J. Herschel, to whom I sent a copy, is going to read my book. He\r\nsays he leans to the side opposed to me. If you should meet him after he\r\nhas read me, pray find out what he thinks, for, of course, he will\r\nnot write; and I should excessively like to hear whether I produce any\r\neffect on such a mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.H. HUXLEY TO CHARLES DARWIN. Jermyn Street W., November 23rd, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI finished your book yesterday, a lucky examination having furnished me\r\nwith a few hours of continuous leisure.\r\n\r\nSince I read Von Baer's (Karl Ernst von Baer, born 1792, died at Dorpat\r\n1876--one of the most distinguished biologists of the century. He\r\npractically founded the modern science of embryology.) essays, nine\r\nyears ago, no work on Natural History Science I have met with has made\r\nso great an impression upon me, and I do most heartily thank you for\r\nthe great store of new views you have given me. Nothing, I think, can\r\nbe better than the tone of the book, it impresses those who know nothing\r\nabout the subject. As for your doctrine, I am prepared to go to the\r\nstake, if requisite, in support of Chapter IX., and most parts of\r\nChapters X., XI., XII., and Chapter XIII. contains much that is most\r\nadmirable, but on one or two points I enter a caveat until I can see\r\nfurther into all sides of the question.\r\n\r\nAs to the first four chapters, I agree thoroughly and fully with all the\r\nprinciples laid down in them. I think you have demonstrated a true cause\r\nfor the production of species, and have thrown the onus probandi that\r\nspecies did not arise in the way you suppose, on your adversaries.\r\n\r\nBut I feel that I have not yet by any means fully realized the bearings\r\nof those most remarkable and original Chapters III., IV. and V., and I\r\nwill write no more about them just now.\r\n\r\nThe only objections that have occurred to me are, 1st that you have\r\nloaded yourself with an unnecessary difficulty in adopting Natura non\r\nfacit saltum so unreservedly... And 2nd, it is not clear to me why, if\r\ncontinual physical conditions are of so little moment as you suppose,\r\nvariation should occur at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, I must read the book two or three times more before I presume\r\nto begin picking holes.\r\n\r\nI trust you will not allow yourself to be in any way disgusted or\r\nannoyed by the considerable abuse and misrepresentation which, unless I\r\ngreatly mistake, is in store for you. Depend upon it you have earned the\r\nlasting gratitude of all thoughtful men. And as to the curs which will\r\nbark and yelp, you must recollect that some of your friends, at any\r\nrate, are endowed with an amount of combativeness which (though you have\r\noften and justly rebuked it) may stand you in good stead.\r\n\r\nI am sharpening up my claws and beak in readiness.\r\n\r\nLooking back over my letter, it really expresses so feebly all I think\r\nabout you and your noble book that I am half ashamed of it; but you will\r\nunderstand that, like the parrot in the story, \"I think the more.\"\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully, T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Ilkley, November 25th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nYour letter has been forwarded to me from Down. Like a good Catholic who\r\nhas received extreme unction, I can now sing \"nunc dimittis.\" I should\r\nhave been more than contented with one quarter of what you have said.\r\nExactly fifteen months ago, when I put pen to paper for this volume, I\r\nhad awful misgivings; and thought perhaps I had deluded myself, like\r\nso many have done, and I then fixed in my mind three judges, on whose\r\ndecision I determined mentally to abide. The judges were Lyell, Hooker,\r\nand yourself. It was this which made me so excessively anxious for your\r\nverdict. I am now contented, and can sing my nunc dimittis. What a joke\r\nit would be if I pat you on the back when you attack some immovable\r\ncreationist! You have most cleverly hit on one point, which has greatly\r\ntroubled me; if, as I must think, external conditions produce little\r\nDIRECT effect, what the devil determines each particular variation? What\r\nmakes a tuft of feathers come on a cock's head, or moss on a moss-rose?\r\nI shall much like to talk over this with you...\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley, I thank you cordially for your letter.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Hereafter I shall be particularly curious to hear what you think\r\nof my explanation of Embryological similarity. On classification I fear\r\nwe shall split. Did you perceive the argumentum ad hominem Huxley about\r\nkangaroo and bear?\r\n\r\n\r\nERASMUS DARWIN (His brother.) TO CHARLES DARWIN. November 23rd [1859].\r\n\r\nDear Charles,\r\n\r\nI am so much weaker in the head, that I hardly know if I can write, but\r\nat all events I will jot down a few things that the Dr. (Dr., afterwards\r\nSir Henry Holland.) has said. He has not read much above half, so as he\r\nsays he can give no definite conclusion, and it is my private belief he\r\nwishes to remain in that state... He is evidently in a dreadful state of\r\nindecision, and keeps stating that he is not tied down to either view,\r\nand that he has always left an escape by the way he has spoken of\r\nvarieties. I happened to speak of the eye before he had read that part,\r\nand it took away his breath--utterly impossible--structure, function,\r\netc., etc., etc., but when he had read it he hummed and hawed, and\r\nperhaps it was partly conceivable, and then he fell back on the bones\r\nof the ear, which were beyond all probability or conceivability. He\r\nmentioned a slight blot, which I also observed, that in speaking of the\r\nslave-ants carrying one another, you change the species without giving\r\nnotice first, and it makes one turn back...\r\n\r\n... For myself I really think it is the most interesting book I ever\r\nread, and can only compare it to the first knowledge of chemistry,\r\ngetting into a new world or rather behind the scenes. To me the\r\ngeographical distribution, I mean the relation of islands to continents,\r\nis the most convincing of the proofs, and the relation of the oldest\r\nforms to the existing species. I dare say I don't feel enough the\r\nabsence of varieties, but then I don't in the least know if everything\r\nnow living were fossilized whether the paleontologists could distinguish\r\nthem. In fact the a priori reasoning is so entirely satisfactory to me\r\nthat if the facts won't fit in, why so much the worse for the facts is\r\nmy feeling. My ague has left me in such a state of torpidity that I wish\r\nI had gone through the process of natural selection.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, E.A.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Ilkley, November [24th, 1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nAgain I have to thank you for a most valuable lot of criticisms in a\r\nletter dated 22nd.\r\n\r\nThis morning I heard also from Murray that he sold the whole edition\r\n(First edition, 1250 copies.) the first day to the trade. He wants a new\r\nedition instantly, and this utterly confounds me. Now, under water-cure,\r\nwith all nervous power directed to the skin, I cannot possibly do\r\nhead-work, and I must make only actually necessary corrections. But\r\nI will, as far as I can without my manuscript, take advantage of your\r\nsuggestions: I must not attempt much. Will you send me one line to say\r\nwhether I must strike out about the secondary whale (The passage\r\nwas omitted in the second edition.), it goes to my heart. About the\r\nrattle-snake, look to my Journal, under Trigonocephalus, and you will\r\nsee the probable origin of the rattle, and generally in transitions it\r\nis the premier pas qui coute.\r\n\r\nMadame Belloc wants to translate my book into French; I have offered\r\nto look over proofs for SCIENTIFIC errors. Did you ever hear of her? I\r\nbelieve Murray has agreed at my urgent advice, but I fear I have been\r\nrash and premature. Quatrefages has written to me, saying he agrees\r\nlargely with my views. He is an excellent naturalist. I am pressed for\r\ntime. Will you give us one line about the whales? Again I thank you\r\nfor neve-tiring advice and assistance; I do in truth reverence your\r\nunselfish and pure love of truth.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell, ever yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[With regard to a French translation, he wrote to Mr. Murray in November\r\n1859: \"I am EXTREMELY anxious, for the subject's sake (and God knows\r\nnot for mere fame), to have my book translated; and indirectly its being\r\nknown abroad will do good to the English sale. If it depended on me, I\r\nshould agree without payment, and instantly send a copy, and only beg\r\nthat she [Mme. Belloc] would get some scientific man to look over\r\nthe translation... You might say that, though I am a very poor French\r\nscholar, I could detect any scientific mistake, and would read over the\r\nFrench proofs.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposed translation was not made, and a second plan fell through\r\nin the following year. He wrote to M. de Quatrefages: \"The gentleman\r\nwho wished to translate my 'Origin of Species' has failed in getting a\r\npublisher. Balliere, Masson, and Hachette all rejected it with contempt.\r\nIt was foolish and presumptuous in me, hoping to appear in a French\r\ndress; but the idea would not have entered my head had it not been\r\nsuggested to me. It is a great loss. I must console myself with the\r\nGerman edition which Prof. Bronn is bringing out.\" (See letters to\r\nBronn, page 70.)\r\n\r\nA sentence in another letter to M. de Quatrefages shows how anxious he\r\nwas to convert one of the greatest of contemporary Zoologists: \"How I\r\nshould like to know whether Milne Edwards had read the copy which I sent\r\nhim, and whether he thinks I have made a pretty good case on our side\r\nof the question. There is no naturalist in the world for whose opinion I\r\nhave so profound a respect. Of course I am not so silly as to expect to\r\nchange his opinion.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Ilkley, [November 26th, 1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI have received your letter of the 24th. It is no use trying to thank\r\nyou; your kindness is beyond thanks. I will certainly leave out the\r\nwhale and bear...\r\n\r\nThe edition was 1250 copies. When I was in spirits, I sometimes fancied\r\nthat my book would be successful, but I never even built a castle in the\r\nair of such success as it has met with; I do not mean the sale, but the\r\nimpression it has made on you (whom I have always looked at as chief\r\njudge) and Hooker and Huxley. The whole has infinitely exceeded my\r\nwildest hopes.\r\n\r\nFarewell, I am tired, for I have been going over the sheets.\r\n\r\nMy kind friend, farewell, yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Ilkley, Yorkshire, December 2nd [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nEvery note which you have sent me has interested me much. Pray thank\r\nLady Lyell for her remark. In the chapters she refers to, I was unable\r\nto modify the passage in accordance with your suggestion; but in the\r\nfinal chapter I have modified three or four. Kingsley, in a note (The\r\nletter is given below) to me, had a capital paragraph on such notions\r\nas mine being NOT opposed to a high conception of the Deity. I have\r\ninserted it as an extract from a letter to me from a celebrated author\r\nand divine. I have put in about nascent organs. I had the greatest\r\ndifficulty in partially making out Sedgwick's letter, and I dare say I\r\ndid greatly underrate its clearness. Do what I could, I fear I shall\r\nbe greatly abused. In answer to Sedgwick's remark that my book would be\r\n\"mischievous,\" I asked him whether truth can be known except by being\r\nvictorious over all attacks. But it is no use. H.C. Watson tells me that\r\none zoologist says he will read my book, \"but I will never believe it.\"\r\nWhat a spirit to read any book in! Crawford writes to me that his notice\r\n(John Crawford, orientalist, ethnologist, etc., 1783-1868. The review\r\nappeared in the \"Examiner\", and, though hostile, is free from bigotry,\r\nas the following citation will show: \"We cannot help saying that piety\r\nmust be fastidious indeed that objects to a theory the tendency of which\r\nis to show that all organic beings, man included, are in a perpetual\r\nprogress of amelioration, and that is expounded in the reverential\r\nlanguage which we have quoted.\") will be hostile, but that \"he will\r\nnot calumniate the author.\" He says he has read my book, \"at least such\r\nparts as he could understand.\" He sent me some notes and suggestions\r\n(quite unimportant), and they show me that I have unavoidably done\r\nharm to the subject, by publishing an abstract. He is a real Pallasian;\r\nnearly all our domestic races descended from a multitude of wild species\r\nnow commingled. I expected Murchison to be outrageous. How little he\r\ncould ever have grappled with the subject of denudation! How singular\r\nso great a geologist should have so unphilosophical a mind! I have had\r\nseveral notes from --, very civil and less decided. Says he shall not\r\npronounce against me without much reflection, PERHAPS WILL SAY NOTHING\r\non the subject. X. says -- will go to that part of hell, which Dante\r\ntells us is appointed for those who are neither on God's side nor on\r\nthat of the devil.\r\n\r\nI fully believe that I owe the comfort of the next few years of my life\r\nto your generous support, and that of a very few others. I do not think\r\nI am brave enough to have stood being odious without support; now I feel\r\nas bold as a lion. But there is one thing I can see I must learn, viz.,\r\nto think less of myself and my book. Farewell, with cordial thanks.\r\n\r\nYours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI return home on the 7th, and shall sleep at Erasmus's. I will call on\r\nyou about ten o'clock, on Thursday, the 8th, and sit with you, as I have\r\nso often sat, during your breakfast.\r\n\r\nI wish there was any chance of Prestwich being shaken; but I fear he is\r\ntoo much of a catastrophist.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In December there appeared in 'Macmillan's Magazine' an article, \"Time\r\nand Life,\" by Professor Huxley. It is mainly occupied by an analysis\r\nof the argument of the 'Origin,' but it also gives the substance of\r\na lecture delivered at the Royal Institution before that book was\r\npublished. Professor Huxley spoke strongly in favour of evolution in his\r\nLecture, and explains that in so doing he was to a great extent resting\r\non a knowledge of \"the general tenor of the researches in which Mr.\r\nDarwin had been so long engaged,\" and was supported in so doing by his\r\nperfect confidence in his knowledge, perseverance, and \"high-minded love\r\nof truth.\" My father was evidently deeply pleased by Mr. Huxley's words,\r\nand wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I must thank you for your extremely kind notice of my book in\r\n'Macmillan.' No one could receive a more delightful and honourable\r\ncompliment. I had not heard of your Lecture, owing to my retired life.\r\nYou attribute much too much to me from our mutual friendship. You have\r\nexplained my leading idea with admirable clearness. What a gift you have\r\nof writing (or more properly) thinking clearly.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.B. CARPENTER. Ilkley, Yorkshire, December 3rd\r\n[1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Carpenter,\r\n\r\nI am perfectly delighted at your letter. It is a great thing to have got\r\na great physiologist on our side. I say \"our\" for we are now a good and\r\ncompact body of really good men, and mostly not old men. In the long run\r\nwe shall conquer. I do not like being abused, but I feel that I can now\r\nbear it; and, as I told Lyell, I am well convinced that it is the first\r\noffender who reaps the rich harvest of abuse. You have done an essential\r\nkindness in checking the odium theologicum in the E.R. (This must refer\r\nto Carpenter's critique which would now have been ready to appear in the\r\nJanuary number of the \"Edinburgh Review\", 1860, and in which the odium\r\ntheologicum is referred to.) It much pains all one's female relations\r\nand injures the cause.\r\n\r\nI look at it as immaterial whether we go quite the same lengths; and I\r\nsuspect, judging from myself, that you will go further, by thinking of\r\na population of forms like Ornithorhyncus, and by thinking of the\r\ncommon homological and embryological structure of the several vertebrate\r\norders. But this is immaterial. I quite agree that the principle is\r\neverything. In my fuller MS. I have discussed a good many instincts;\r\nbut there will surely be more unfilled gaps here than with corporeal\r\nstructure, for we have no fossil instincts, and know scarcely any except\r\nof European animals. When I reflect how very slowly I came round myself,\r\nI am in truth astonished at the candour shown by Lyell, Hooker, Huxley,\r\nand yourself. In my opinion it is grand. I thank you cordially for\r\ntaking the trouble of writing a review for the 'National.' God knows\r\nI shall have few enough in any degree favourable. (See a letter to Dr.\r\nCarpenter below.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Saturday [December 5th, 1859].\r\n\r\n... I have had a letter from Carpenter this morning. He reviews me in\r\nthe 'National.' He is a convert, but does not go quite so far as I, but\r\nquite far enough, for he admits that all birds are from one progenitor,\r\nand probably all fishes and reptiles from another parent. But the\r\nlast mouthful chokes him. He can hardly admit all vertebrates from one\r\nparent. He will surely come to this from Homology and Embryology. I look\r\nat it as grand having brought round a great physiologist, for great I\r\nthink he certainly is in that line. How curious I shall be to know what\r\nline Owen will take; dead against us, I fear; but he wrote me a most\r\nliberal note on the reception of my book, and said he was quite prepared\r\nto consider fairly and without prejudice my line of argument.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.D. HOOKER TO CHARLES DARWIN. Kew, Monday.\r\n\r\nDear Darwin,\r\n\r\nYou have, I know, been drenched with letters since the publication of\r\nyour book, and I have hence forborne to add my mite. I hope now that you\r\nare well through Edition II., and I have heard that you were flourishing\r\nin London. I have not yet got half-through the book, not from want of\r\nwill, but of time--for it is the very hardest book to read, to full\r\nprofits, that I ever tried--it is so cram-full of matter and reasoning.\r\nI am all the more glad that you have published in this form, for the\r\nthree volumes, unprefaced by this, would have choked any Naturalist\r\nof the nineteenth century, and certainly have softened my brain in\r\nthe operation of assimilating their contents. I am perfectly tired of\r\nmarvelling at the wonderful amount of facts you have brought to bear,\r\nand your skill in marshalling them and throwing them on the enemy; it\r\nis also extremely clear as far as I have gone, but very hard to fully\r\nappreciate. Somehow it reads very different from the MS., and I often\r\nfancy I must have been very stupid not to have more fully followed it in\r\nMS. Lyell told me of his criticisms. I did not appreciate them all, and\r\nthere are many little matters I hope one day to talk over with you. I\r\nsaw a highly flattering notice in the 'English Churchman,' short and\r\nnot at all entering into discussion, but praising you and your book, and\r\ntalking patronizingly of the doctrine!... Bentham and Henslow will still\r\nshake their heads I fancy...\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately, JOS. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, Saturday [December 12th, 1859].\r\n\r\n... I had very long interviews with --, which perhaps you would like to\r\nhear about... I infer from several expressions that, at bottom, he goes\r\nan immense way with us...\r\n\r\nHe said to the effect that my explanation was the best ever published of\r\nthe manner of formation of species. I said I was very glad to hear it.\r\nHe took me up short: \"You must not at all suppose that I agree with you\r\nin all respects.\" I said I thought it no more likely that I should be\r\nright in nearly all points, than that I should toss up a penny and get\r\nheads twenty times running. I asked him what he thought the weakest\r\npart. He said he had no particular objection to any part. He added:--\r\n\r\n\"If I must criticise, I should say, 'we do not want to know what Darwin\r\nbelieves and is convinced of, but what he can prove.'\" I agreed most\r\nfully and truly that I have probably greatly sinned in this line, and\r\ndefended my general line of argument of inventing a theory and seeing\r\nhow many classes of facts the theory would explain. I added that I\r\nwould endeavour to modify the \"believes\" and \"convinceds.\" He took me up\r\nshort: \"You will then spoil your book, the charm of (!) it is that it is\r\nDarwin himself.\" He added another objection, that the book was too teres\r\natque rotundus--that it explained everything, and that it was improbable\r\nin the highest degree that I should succeed in this. I quite agree with\r\nthis rather queer objection, and it comes to this that my book must be\r\nvery bad or very good...\r\n\r\nI have heard, by roundabout channel, that Herschel says my book \"is the\r\nlaw of higgledy-piggledy.\" What this exactly means I do not know, but\r\nit is evidently very contemptuous. If true this is a great blow and\r\ndiscouragement.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO JOHN LUBBOCK. December 14th [1859].\r\n\r\n... The latter part of my stay at Ilkley did me much good, but I suppose\r\nI never shall be strong, for the work I have had since I came back has\r\nknocked me up a little more than once. I have been busy in getting a\r\nreprint (with a very few corrections) through the press.\r\n\r\nMy book has been as yet VERY MUCH more successful than I ever dreamed\r\nof: Murray is now printing 3000 copies. Have you finished it? If so,\r\npray tell me whether you are with me on the GENERAL issue, or against\r\nme. If you are against me, I know well how honourable, fair, and candid\r\nan opponent I shall have, and which is a good deal more than I can say\r\nof all my opponents...\r\n\r\nPray tell me what you have been doing. Have you had time for any Natural\r\nHistory?...\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have got--I wish and hope I might say that WE have got--a fair\r\nnumber of excellent men on our side of the question on the mutability of\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 14th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYour approval of my book, for many reasons, gives me intense\r\nsatisfaction; but I must make some allowance for your kindness and\r\nsympathy. Any one with ordinary faculties, if he had PATIENCE enough and\r\nplenty of time, could have written my book. You do not know how I admire\r\nyour and Lyell's generous and unselfish sympathy, I do not believe\r\neither of you would have cared so much about your own work. My book, as\r\nyet, has been far more successful than I ever even formerly ventured in\r\nthe wildest day-dreams to anticipate. We shall soon be a good body\r\nof working men, and shall have, I am convinced, all young and rising\r\nnaturalists on our side. I shall be intensely interested to hear whether\r\nmy book produces any effect on A. Gray; from what I heard at Lyell's, I\r\nfancy your correspondence has brought him some way already. I fear that\r\nthere is no chance of Bentham being staggered. Will he read my book? Has\r\nhe a copy? I would send him one of the reprints if he has not. Old J.E.\r\nGray (John Edward Gray (1800-1875), was the son of S.F. Gray, author\r\nof the 'Supplement to the Pharmacopoeia.' In 1821 he published in his\r\nfather's name 'The Natural Arrangement of British Plants,' one of the\r\nearliest works in English on the natural method. In 1824 he became\r\nconnected with the Natural History Department of the British Museum, and\r\nwas appointed Keeper of the Zoological collections in 1840. He was the\r\nauthor of 'Illustrations of Indian Zoology,' 'The Knowsley Menagerie,'\r\netc., and of innumerable descriptive Zoological papers.), at the British\r\nMuseum, attacked me in fine style: \"You have just reproduced Lamarck's\r\ndoctrine and nothing else, and here Lyell and others have been attacking\r\nhim for twenty years, and because YOU (with a sneer and laugh) say the\r\nvery same thing, they are all coming round; it is the most ridiculous\r\ninconsistency, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nYou must be very glad to be settled in your house, and I hope all the\r\nimprovements satisfy you. As far as my experience goes, improvements\r\nare never perfection. I am very sorry to hear that you are still so very\r\nbusy, and have so much work. And now for the main purport of my note,\r\nwhich is to ask and beg you and Mrs. Hooker (whom it is really an age\r\nsince I have seen), and all your children, if you like, to come\r\nand spend a week here. It would be a great pleasure to me and to my\r\nwife... As far as we can see, we shall be at home all the winter; and all\r\ntimes probably would be equally convenient; but if you can, do not put\r\nit off very late, as it may slip through. Think of this and persuade\r\nMrs. Hooker, and be a good man and come.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my kind and dear friend, Yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I shall be very curious to hear what you think of my discussion on\r\nClassification in Chapter XIII.; I believe Huxley demurs to the whole,\r\nand says he has nailed his colours to the mast, and I would sooner die\r\nthan give up; so that we are in as fine a frame of mind to discuss the\r\npoint as any two religionists.\r\n\r\nEmbryology is my pet bit in my book, and, confound my friends, not one\r\nhas noticed this to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, December 21st [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI have just received your most kind, long, and valuable letter. I will\r\nwrite again in a few days, for I am at present unwell and much pressed\r\nwith business: to-day's note is merely personal. I should, for several\r\nreasons, be very glad of an American Edition. I have made up my mind to\r\nbe well abused; but I think it of importance that my notions should be\r\nread by intelligent men, accustomed to scientific argument, though NOT\r\nnaturalists. It may seem absurd, but I think such men will drag after\r\nthem those naturalists who have too firmly fixed in their heads that a\r\nspecies is an entity. The first edition of 1250 copies was sold on the\r\nfirst day, and now my publisher is printing off, as RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE,\r\n3000 more copies. I mention this solely because it renders probable\r\na remunerative sale in America. I should be infinitely obliged if you\r\ncould aid an American reprint; and could make, for my sake and the\r\npublisher's, any arrangement for any profit. The new edition is only a\r\nreprint, yet I have made a FEW important corrections. I will have the\r\nclean sheets sent over in a few days of as many sheets as are printed\r\noff, and the remainder afterwards, and you can do anything you like,--if\r\nnothing, there is no harm done. I should be glad for the new edition to\r\nbe reprinted and not the old.--In great haste, and with hearty thanks,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI will write soon again.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, 22nd [December, 1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell, Thanks about \"Bears\" (See 'Origin,' edition i., page\r\n184.), a word of il-omen to me.\r\n\r\nI am too unwell to leave home, so shall not see you.\r\n\r\nI am very glad of your remarks on Hooker. (Sir C. Lyell wrote to Sir\r\nJ.D. Hooker, December 19, 1859 ('Life,' ii. page 327): \"I have just\r\nfinished the reading of your splendid Essay [the 'Flora of Australia']\r\non the origin of species, as illustrated by your wide botanical\r\nexperience, and think it goes very far to raise the variety-making\r\nhypothesis to the rank of a theory, as accounting for the manner in\r\nwhich new species enter the world.\") I have not yet got the essay.\r\nThe parts which I read in sheets seemed to me grand, especially the\r\ngeneralization about the Australian flora itself. How superior to\r\nRobert Brown's celebrated essay! I have not seen Naudin's paper ('Revue\r\nHorticole,' 1852. See historical Sketch in the later editions of the\r\n'Origin of Species.'), and shall not be able till I hunt the libraries.\r\nI am very anxious to see it. Decaisne seems to think he gives my whole\r\ntheory. I do not know when I shall have time and strength to grapple\r\nwith Hooker...\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have heard from Sir W. Jardine (Jardine, Sir William, Bart.,\r\n1800-1874), was the son of Sir A. Jardine of Applegarth, Dumfriesshire.\r\nHe was educated at Edinburgh, and succeeded to the title on his father's\r\ndecease in 1821. He published, jointly with Mr. Prideaux, J. Selby,\r\nSir Stamford Raffles, Dr. Horsfield, and other ornithologists,\r\n'Illustrations of Ornithology,' and edited the 'Naturalist's Library,'\r\nin 40 volumes, which included the four branches: Mammalia, Ornithology,\r\nIchnology, and Entomology. Of these 40 volumes 14 were written by\r\nhimself. In 1836 he became editor of the 'Magazine of Zoology and\r\nBotany,' which, two years later, was transformed into 'Annals of Natural\r\nHistory,' but remained under his direction. For Bohn's Standard Library\r\nhe edited White's 'Natural History of Selborne.' Sir W. Jardine was also\r\njoint editor of the 'Edinburgh Philosophical Journal,' and was author of\r\n'British Salmonidae,' 'Ichthyology of Annandale,' 'Memoirs of the\r\nlate Hugh Strickland,' 'Contributions to Ornithology,' 'Ornithological\r\nSynonyms,' etc.--(Taken from Ward, 'Men of the Reign,' and Cates,\r\n'Dictionary of General Biography.'): his criticisms are quite\r\nunimportant; some of the Galapagos so-called species ought to be called\r\nvarieties, which I fully expected; some of the sub-genera, thought to be\r\nwholly endemic, have been found on the Continent (not that he gives his\r\nauthority), but I do not make out that the species are the same. His\r\nletter is brief and vague, but he says he will write again.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [23rd December, 1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI received last night your 'Introduction,' for which very many thanks;\r\nI am surprised to see how big it is: I shall not be able to read it very\r\nsoon. It was very good of you to send Naudin, for I was very curious to\r\nsee it. I am surprised that Decaisne should say it was the same as\r\nmine. Naudin gives artificial selection, as well as a score of English\r\nwriters, and when he says species were formed in the same manner, I\r\nthought the paper would certainly prove exactly the same as mine. But\r\nI cannot find one word like the struggle for existence and natural\r\nselection. On the contrary, he brings in his principle (page 103) of\r\nfinality (which I do not understand), which, he says, with some authors\r\nis fatality, with others providence, and which adapts the forms of every\r\nbeing, and harmonises them all throughout nature.\r\n\r\nHe assumes like old geologists (who assumed that the forces of nature\r\nwere formerly greater), that species were at first more plastic. His\r\nsimile of tree and classification is like mine (and others), but he\r\ncannot, I think, have reflected much on the subject, otherwise he would\r\nsee that genealogy by itself does not give classification; I declare I\r\ncannot see a MUCH closer approach to Wallace and me in Naudin than in\r\nLamarck--we all agree in modification and descent. If I do not hear from\r\nyou I will return the 'Revue' in a few days (with the cover). I dare say\r\nLyell would be glad to see it. By the way, I will retain the volume till\r\nI hear whether I shall or not send it to Lyell. I should rather like\r\nLyell to see this note, though it is foolish work sticking up for\r\nindependence or priority.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. SEDGWICK (Rev. Adam Sedgwick, 1785-1873, Woodwardian Professor of\r\nGeology in the University of Cambridge.) TO CHARLES DARWIN. Cambridge,\r\nDecember 24th, [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI write to thank you for your work on the 'Origin of Species.' It came,\r\nI think, in the latter part of last week; but it MAY have come a few\r\ndays sooner, and been overlooked among my book-parcels, which often\r\nremain unopened when I am lazy or busy with any work before me. So\r\nsoon as I opened it I began to read it, and I finished it, after many\r\ninterruptions, on Tuesday. Yesterday I was employed--1st, in preparing\r\nfor my lecture; 2ndly, in attending a meeting of my brother Fellows\r\nto discuss the final propositions of the Parliamentary Commissioners;\r\n3rdly, in lecturing; 4thly, in hearing the conclusion of the discussion\r\nand the College reply, whereby, in conformity with my own wishes, we\r\naccepted the scheme of the Commissioners; 5thly, in dining with an old\r\nfriend at Clare College; 6thly, in adjourning to the weekly meeting of\r\nthe Ray Club, from which I returned at 10 P.M., dog-tired, and hardly\r\nable to climb my staircase. Lastly, in looking through the \"Times\" to\r\nsee what was going on in the busy world.\r\n\r\nI do not state this to fill space (though I believe that Nature does\r\nabhor a vacuum), but to prove that my reply and my thanks are sent to\r\nyou by the earliest leisure I have, though that is but a very contracted\r\nopportunity. If I did not think you a good-tempered and truth-loving\r\nman, I should not tell you that (spite of the great knowledge, store of\r\nfacts, capital views of the correlation of the various parts of organic\r\nnature, admirable hints about the diffusion, through wide regions of\r\nmany related organic beings, etc., etc.) I have read your book with more\r\npain than pleasure. Parts of it I admired greatly, parts I laughed at\r\ntill my sides were almost sore; other parts I read with absolute sorrow,\r\nbecause I think them utterly false and grievously mischievous. You\r\nhave DESERTED--after a start in that tram-road of all solid physical\r\ntruth--the true method of induction, and started us in machinery as\r\nwild, I think, as Bishop Wilkins's locomotive that was to sail with us\r\nto the moon. Many of your wide conclusions are based upon assumptions\r\nwhich can neither be proved nor disproved, why then express them in the\r\nlanguage and arrangement of philosophical induction? As to your grand\r\nprinciple--NATURAL SELECTION--what is it but a secondary consequence of\r\nsupposed, or known, primary facts! Development is a better word, because\r\nmore close to the cause of the fact? For you do not deny causation. I\r\ncall (in the abstract) causation the will of God; and I can prove that\r\nHe acts for the good of His creatures. He also acts by laws which we\r\ncan study and comprehend. Acting by law, and under what is called\r\nfinal causes, comprehends, I think, your whole principle. You write of\r\n\"natural selection\" as if it were done curiously by the selecting\r\nagent. 'Tis but a consequence of the presupposed development, and\r\nthe subsequent battle for life. This view of nature you have stated\r\nadmirably, though admitted by all naturalists and denied by no one of\r\ncommon sense. We all admit development as a fact of history: but how\r\ncame it about? Here, in language, and still more in logic, we are\r\npoint-blank at issue. There is a moral or metaphysical part of nature\r\nas well a physical. A man who denies this is deep in the mire of folly.\r\n'Tis the crown and glory of organic science that it DOES through FINAL\r\nCAUSE, link material and moral; and yet DOES NOT allow us to mingle them\r\nin our first conception of laws, and our classification of such laws,\r\nwhether we consider one side of nature or the other. You have ignored\r\nthis link; and, if I do not mistake your meaning, you have done your\r\nbest in one or two pregnant cases to break it. Were it possible (which,\r\nthank God, it is not) to break it, humanity, in my mind, would suffer\r\na damage that might brutalize it, and sink the human race into a lower\r\ngrade of degradation than any into which it has fallen since its written\r\nrecords tell us of its history. Take the case of the bee-cells. If your\r\ndevelopment produced the successive modification of the bee and its\r\ncells (which no mortal can prove), final cause would stand good as\r\nthe directing cause under which the successive generations acted and\r\ngradually improved. Passages in your book, like that to which I have\r\nalluded (and there are others almost as bad), greatly shocked my moral\r\ntaste. I think, in speculating on organic descent, you OVER-state the\r\nevidence of geology; and that you UNDER-state it while you are talking\r\nof the broken links of your natural pedigree: but my paper is nearly\r\ndone, and I must go to my lecture-room. Lastly, then, I greatly dislike\r\nthe concluding chapter--not as a summary, for in that light it appears\r\ngood--but I dislike it from the tone of triumphant confidence in which\r\nyou appeal to the rising generation (in a tone I condemned in the author\r\nof the 'Vestiges') and prophesy of things not yet in the womb of time,\r\nnor (if we are to trust the accumulated experience of human sense and\r\nthe inferences of its logic) ever likely to be found anywhere but in the\r\nfertile womb of man's imagination. And now to say a word about a son of\r\na monkey and an old friend of yours: I am better, far better, than I was\r\nlast year. I have been lecturing three days a week (formerly I gave six\r\na week) without much fatigue, but I find by the loss of activity and\r\nmemory, and of all productive powers, that my bodily frame is sinking\r\nslowly towards the earth. But I have visions of the future. They are as\r\nmuch a part of myself as my stomach and my heart, and these visions are\r\nto have their antitype in solid fruition of what is best and greatest.\r\nBut on one condition only--that I humbly accept God's revelation of\r\nHimself both in his works and in His word, and do my best to act in\r\nconformity with that knowledge which He only can give me, and He only\r\ncan sustain me in doing. If you and I do all this we shall meet in\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nI have written in a hurry, and in a spirit of brotherly love, therefore\r\nforgive any sentence you happen to dislike; and believe me, spite of\r\nany disagreement in some points of the deepest moral interest, your\r\ntru-hearted old friend,\r\n\r\nA. SEDGWICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, December 25th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nOne part of your note has pleased me so much that I must thank you for\r\nit. Not only Sir H.H. [Holland], but several others, have attacked\r\nme about analogy leading to belief in one primordial CREATED form.\r\n('Origin,' edition i. page 484.--\"Therefore I should infer from analogy\r\nthat probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth\r\nhave descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first\r\nbreathed.\") (By which I mean only that we know nothing as yet [of] how\r\nlife originates.) I thought I was universally condemned on this head.\r\nBut I answered that though perhaps it would have been more prudent\r\nnot to have put it in, I would not strike it out, as it seemed to me\r\nprobable, and I give it on no other grounds. You will see in your mind\r\nthe kind of arguments which made me think it probable, and no one\r\nfact had so great an effect on me as your most curious remarks on the\r\napparent homologies of the head of Vertebrata and Articulata.\r\n\r\nYou have done a real good turn in the Agency business (\"My General\r\nAgent\" was a sobriquet applied at this time by my father to Mr. Huxley.)\r\n(I never before heard of a hard-working, unpaid agent besides yourself),\r\nin talking with Sir H.H., for he will have great influence over many.\r\nHe floored me from my ignorance about the bones of the ear, and I made a\r\nmental note to ask you what the facts were.\r\n\r\nWith hearty thanks and real admiration for your generous zeal for the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nYours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nYou may smile about the care and precautions I have taken about my ugly\r\nMS. (Manuscript left with Mr. Huxley for his perusal.); it is not so\r\nmuch the value I set on them, but the remembrance of the intolerable\r\nlabour--for instance, in tracing the history of the breeds of pigeons.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, 25th [December, 1859].\r\n\r\n... I shall not write to Decaisne (With regard to Naudin's paper in the\r\n'Revue Horticole,' 1852.); I have always had a strong feeling that\r\nno one had better defend his own priority. I cannot say that I am as\r\nindifferent to the subject as I ought to be, but one can avoid doing\r\nanything in consequence.\r\n\r\nI do not believe one iota about your having assimilated any of my\r\nnotions unconsciously. You have always done me more than justice. But I\r\ndo think I did you a bad turn by getting you to read the old MS., as it\r\nmust have checked your own original thoughts. There is one thing I\r\nam fully convinced of, that the future progress (which is the really\r\nimportant point) of the subject will have depended on really good and\r\nwell-known workers, like yourself, Lyell, and Huxley, having taken up\r\nthe subject, than on my own work. I see plainly it is this that strikes\r\nmy no-scientific friends.\r\n\r\nLast night I said to myself, I would just cut your Introduction, but\r\nwould not begin to read, but I broke down, and had a good hour's read.\r\n\r\nFarewell, yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. December 28th, 1859.\r\n\r\n... Have you seen the splendid essay and notice of my book in the\r\n\"Times\"? (December 26th.) I cannot avoid a strong suspicion that it is\r\nby Huxley; but I never heard that he wrote in the \"Times\". It will do\r\ngrand service,...\r\n\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, December 28th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nYesterday evening, when I read the \"Times\" of a previous day, I was\r\namazed to find a splendid essay and review of me. Who can the author\r\nbe? I am intensely curious. It included an eulogium of me which quite\r\ntouched me, though I am not vain enough to think it all deserved. The\r\nauthor is a literary man, and German scholar. He has read my book\r\nvery attentively; but, what is very remarkable, it seems that he is a\r\nprofound naturalist. He knows my Barnacle-book, and appreciates it\r\ntoo highly. Lastly, he writes and thinks with quite uncommon force and\r\nclearness; and what is even still rarer, his writing is seasoned with\r\nmost pleasant wit. We all laughed heartily over some of the sentences.\r\nI was charmed with those unreasonable mortals, who know anything, all\r\nthinking fit to range themselves on one side. (The reviewer proposes\r\nto pass by the orthodox view, according to which the phenomena of\r\nthe organic world are \"the immediate product of a creative fiat, and\r\nconsequently are out of the domain of science altogether.\" And he does\r\nso \"with less hesitation, as it so happens that those persons who\r\nare practically conversant with the facts of the case (plainly a\r\nconsiderable advantage) have always thought fit to range themselves\"\r\nin the category of those holding \"views which profess to rest on a\r\nscientific basis only, and therefore admit of being argued to their\r\nconsequences.\") Who can it be? Certainly I should have said that there\r\nwas only one man in England who could have written this essay, and\r\nthat YOU were the man. But I suppose I am wrong, and that there is some\r\nhidden genius of great calibre. For how could you influence Jupiter\r\nOlympius and make him give three and a half columns to pure science? The\r\nold fogies will think the world will come to an end. Well, whoever the\r\nman is, he has done great service to the cause, far more than by a\r\ndozen reviews in common periodicals. The grand way he soars above common\r\nreligious prejudices, and the admission of such views into the \"Times\",\r\nI look at as of the highest importance, quite independently of the mere\r\nquestion of species. If you should happen to be ACQUAINTED with the\r\nauthor, for Heaven-sake tell me who he is?\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley, yours most sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[It is impossible to give in a short space an adequate idea of Mr.\r\nHuxley's article in the \"Times\" of December 26. It is admirably planned,\r\nso as to claim for the 'Origin' a respectful hearing, and it abstains\r\nfrom anything like dogmatism in asserting the truth of the doctrines\r\ntherein upheld. A few passages may be quoted:--\"That this most ingenious\r\nhypothesis enables us to give a reason for many apparent anomalies in\r\nthe distribution of living beings in time and space, and that it is not\r\ncontradicted by the main phenomena of life and organisation, appear to\r\nus to be unquestionable.\" Mr. Huxley goes on to recommend to the readers\r\nof the 'Origin' a condition of \"thatige Skepsis\"--a state of \"doubt\r\nwhich so loves truth that it neither dares rest in doubting, nor\r\nextinguish itself by unjustified belief.\" The final paragraph is in a\r\nstrong contrast to Professor Sedgwick and his \"ropes of bubbles\" (see\r\nbelow). Mr. Huxley writes: \"Mr. Darwin abhors mere speculation as\r\nnature abhors a vacuum. He is as greedy of cases and precedents as any\r\nconstitutional lawyer, and all the principles he lays down are capable\r\nof being brought to the test of observation and experiment. The path\r\nhe bids us follow professes to be not a mere airy track, fabricated of\r\nideal cobwebs, but a solid and broad bridge of facts. If it be so, it\r\nwill carry us safely over many a chasm in our knowledge, and lead us to\r\na region free from the snares of those fascinating but barren virgins,\r\nthe Final Causes, against whom a high authority has so justly warned\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that this powerful essay, appearing as it did\r\nin the leading daily Journal, must have had a strong influence on the\r\nreading public. Mr. Huxley allows me to quote from a letter an account\r\nof the happy chance that threw into his hands the opportunity of writing\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"The 'Origin' was sent to Mr. Lucas, one of the staff of the \"Times\"\r\nwriters at that day, in what I suppose was the ordinary course of\r\nbusiness. Mr. Lucas, though an excellent journalist, and, at a later\r\nperiod, editor of 'Once a Week,' was as innocent of any knowledge of\r\nscience as a babe, and bewailed himself to an acquaintance on having to\r\ndeal with such a book. Whereupon he was recommended to ask me to get\r\nhim out of his difficulty, and he applied to me accordingly, explaining,\r\nhowever, that it would be necessary for him formally to adopt anything I\r\nmight be disposed to write, by prefacing it with two or three paragraphs\r\nof his own.\r\n\r\n\"I was too anxious to seize upon the opportunity thus offered of giving\r\nthe book a fair chance with the multitudinous readers of the \"Times\" to\r\nmake any difficulty about conditions; and being then very full of the\r\nsubject, I wrote the article faster, I think, than I ever wrote anything\r\nin my life, and sent it to Mr. Lucas, who duly prefixed his opening\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\n\"When the article appeared, there was much speculation as to its\r\nauthorship. The secret leaked out in time, as all secrets will, but not\r\nby my aid; and then I used to derive a good deal of innocent amusement\r\nfrom the vehement assertions of some of my more acute friends, that they\r\nknew it was mine from the first paragraph!\r\n\r\n\"As the \"Times\" some years since, referred to my connection with\r\nthe review, I suppose there will be no breach of confidence in the\r\npublication of this little history, if you think it worth the space it\r\nwill occupy.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.II. -- THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES' (continued).\r\n\r\n1860.\r\n\r\n[I extract a few entries from my father's Diary:--\r\n\r\n\"January 7th. The second edition, 3000 copies, of 'Origin' was\r\npublished.\"\r\n\r\n\"May 22nd. The first edition of 'Origin' in the United States was 2500\r\ncopies.\"\r\n\r\nMy father has here noted down the sums received for the 'Origin.'\r\n\r\nFirst Edition......180 pounds Second Edition.....636 pounds 13 shillings\r\n4 pence\r\n\r\nTotal..............816 pounds 13 shillings 4 pence.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of the second edition he began at once, on January\r\n9th, looking over his materials for the 'Variation of Animals and\r\nPlants;' the only other work of the year was on Drosera.\r\n\r\nHe was at Down during the whole of this year, except for a visit to\r\nDr. Lane's Water-cure Establishment at Sudbrooke, and in June, and\r\nfor visits to Miss Elizabeth Wedgwood's house at Hartfield, in Sussex\r\n(July), and to Eastbourne, September 22 to November 16.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 3rd [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have finished your Essay. ('Australian Flora.') As probably you would\r\nlike to hear my opinion, though a non-botanist, I will give it without\r\nany exaggeration. To my judgment it is by far the grandest and most\r\ninteresting essay, on subjects of the nature discussed, I have ever\r\nread. You know how I admired your former essays, but this seems to me\r\nfar grander. I like all the part after page xxvi better than the first\r\npart, probably because newer to me. I dare say you will demur to this,\r\nfor I think every author likes the most speculative parts of his own\r\nproductions. How superior your essay is to the famous one of Brown\r\n(here will be sneer 1st from you). You have made all your conclusions so\r\nadmirably clear, that it would be no use at all to be a botanist (sneer\r\nNo. 2). By Jove, it would do harm to affix any idea to the long names of\r\noutlandish orders. One can look at your conclusions with the philosophic\r\nabstraction with which a mathematician looks at his a times x + the\r\nsquare root of z squared, etc. etc. I hardly know which parts have\r\ninterested me most; for over and over again I exclaimed, \"this beats\r\nall.\" The general comparison of the Flora of Australia with the rest\r\nof the world, strikes me (as before) as extremely original, good, and\r\nsuggestive of many reflections.\r\n\r\n... The invading Indian Flora is very interesting, but I think the fact\r\nyou mention towards the close of the essay--that the Indian vegetation,\r\nin contradistinction to the Malayan vegetation, is found in low and\r\nlevel parts of the Malay Islands, GREATLY lessens the difficulty which\r\nat first (page 1) seemed so great. There is nothing like one's own\r\nhobby-horse. I suspect it is the same case as of glacial migration,\r\nand of naturalised production--of production of greater area conquering\r\nthose of lesser; of course the Indian forms would have a greater\r\ndifficulty in seizing on the cool parts of Australia. I demur to your\r\nremarks (page 1), as not \"conceiving anything in soil, climate, or\r\nvegetation of India,\" which could stop the introduction of Australian\r\nplants. Towards the close of the essay (page civ), you have\r\nadmirable remarks on our profound ignorance of the cause of possible\r\nnaturalisation or introduction; I would answer page 1, by a later page,\r\nviz. page civ.\r\n\r\nYour contrast of the south-west and south-east corners is one of the\r\nmost wonderful cases I ever heard of... You show the case with wonderful\r\nforce. Your discussion on mixed invaders of the south-east corner (and\r\nof New Zealand) is as curious and intricate a problem as of the races\r\nof men in Britain. Your remark on mixed invading Flora keeping down or\r\ndestroying an original Flora, which was richer in number of species,\r\nstrikes me as EMINENTLY NEW AND IMPORTANT. I am not sure whether to me\r\nthe discussion on the New Zealand Flora is not even more instructive. I\r\ncannot too much admire both. But it will require a long time to suck in\r\nall the facts. Your case of the largest Australian orders having none,\r\nor very few, species in New Zealand, is truly marvellous. Anyhow, you\r\nhave now DEMONSTRATED (together with no mammals in New Zealand) (bitter\r\nsneer No. 3), that New Zealand has never been continuously, or even\r\nnearly continuously, united by land to Australia!! At page lxxxix, is\r\nthe only sentence (on this subject) in the whole essay at which I am\r\nmuch inclined to quarrel, viz. that no theory of trans-oceanic migration\r\ncan explain, etc. etc. Now I maintain against all the world, that no man\r\nknows anything about the power of trans-oceanic migration. You do not\r\nknow whether or not the absent orders have seeds which are killed by\r\nsea-water, like almost all Leguminosae, and like another order which\r\nI forget. Birds do not migrate from Australia to New Zealand, and\r\ntherefore floatation SEEMS the only possible means; but yet I maintain\r\nthat we do not know enough to argue on the question, especially as we do\r\nnot know the main fact whether the seeds of Australian orders are killed\r\nby sea-water.\r\n\r\nThe discussion on European Genera is profoundly interesting; but here\r\nalone I earnestly beg for more information, viz. to know which of\r\nthese genera are absent in the Tropics of the world, i.e. confined to\r\ntemperate regions. I excessively wish to know, ON THE NOTION OF GLACIAL\r\nMIGRATION, how much modification has taken place in Australia. I had\r\nbetter explain when we meet, and get you to go over and mark the list.\r\n\r\n... The list of naturalised plants is extremely interesting, but why at\r\nthe end, in the name of all that is good and bad, do you not sum up and\r\ncomment on your facts? Come, I will have a sneer at you in return for\r\nthe many which you will have launched at this letter. Should you have\r\nremarked on the number of plants naturalised in Australia and the United\r\nStates UNDER EXTREMELY DIFFERENT CLIMATES, as showing that climate is\r\nso important, and [on] the considerable sprinkling of plants from\r\nIndia, North America, and South Africa, as showing that the frequent\r\nintroduction of seeds is so important? With respect to \"abundance of\r\nunoccupied ground in Australia,\" do you believe that European plants\r\nintroduced by man now grow on spots in Australia which were absolutely\r\nbare? But I am an impudent dog, one must defend one's own fancy theories\r\nagainst such cruel men as you. I dare say this letter will appear\r\nvery conceited, but one must form an opinion on what one reads with\r\nattention, and in simple truth, I cannot find words strong enough to\r\nexpress my admiration of your essay.\r\n\r\nMy dear old friend, yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I differ about the \"Saturday Review\". (\"Saturday Review\", December\r\n24, 1859. The hostile arguments of the reviewer are geological, and he\r\ndeals especially with the denudation of the Weald. The reviewer remarks\r\nthat, \"if a million of centuries, more or less, is needed for any\r\npart of his argument, he feels no scruple in taking them to suit\r\nhis purpose.\") One cannot expect fairness in a reviewer, so I do not\r\ncomplain of all the other arguments besides the 'Geological Record'\r\nbeing omitted. Some of the remarks about the lapse of years are\r\nvery good, and the reviewer gives me some good and well-deserved\r\nraps--confound it. I am sorry to confess the truth: but it does not at\r\nall concern the main argument. That was a nice notice in the \"Gardeners'\r\nChronicle\". I hope and imagine that Lindley is almost a convert. Do not\r\nforget to tell me if Bentham gets all the more staggered.\r\n\r\nWith respect to tropical plants during the Glacial period, I throw\r\nin your teeth your own facts, at the base of the Himalaya, on the\r\npossibility of the co-existence of at least forms of the tropical and\r\ntemperate regions. I can give a parallel case for animals in Mexico. Oh!\r\nmy dearly beloved puny child, how cruel men are to you! I am very glad\r\nyou approve of the Geographical chapters...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, [January 4th, 1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear L.\r\n\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle\" returned safe. Thanks for note. I am beyond\r\nmeasure glad that you get more and more roused on the subject of\r\nspecies, for, as I have always said, I am well convinced that your\r\nopinions and writings will do far more to convince the world than mine.\r\nYou will make a grand discussion on man. You are very bold in this,\r\nand I honour you. I have been, like you, quite surprised at the want\r\nof originality in opposed arguments and in favour too. Gwyn Jeffreys\r\nattacks me justly in his letter about strictly littoral shells not being\r\noften embedded at least in Tertiary deposits. I was in a muddle, for I\r\nwas thinking of Secondary, yet Chthamalus applied to Tertiary...\r\n\r\nPossibly you might like to see the enclosed note (Dr. Whewell wrote\r\n(January 2, 1860): \"... I cannot, yet at least, become a convert. But\r\nthere is so much of thought and of fact in what you have written that\r\nit is not to be contradicted without careful selection of the ground and\r\nmanner of the dissent.\" Dr. Whewell dissented in a practical manner for\r\nsome years, by refusing to allow a copy of the 'Origin of Species' to\r\nbe placed in the Library of Trinity College.) from Whewell, merely as\r\nshowing that he is not horrified with us. You can return it whenever you\r\nhave occasion to write, so as not to waste your time.\r\n\r\nC.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, [January 4th? 1860].\r\n\r\n... I have had a brief note from Keyserling (Joint author with Murchison\r\nof the 'Geology of Russia,' 1845.), but not worth sending you. He\r\nbelieves in change of species, grants that natural selection explains\r\nwell adaptation of form, but thinks species change too regularly, as\r\nif by some chemical law, for natural selection to be the sole cause of\r\nchange. I can hardly understand his brief note, but this is I think the\r\nupshot.\r\n\r\n... I will send A. Murray's paper whenever published. (The late Andrew\r\nMurray wrote two papers on the 'Origin' in the Proc. R. Soc. Edin. 1860.\r\nThe one referred to here is dated January 16, 1860. The following is\r\nquoted from page 6 of the separate copy: \"But the second, and, as it\r\nappears to me, by much the most important phase of reversion to type\r\n(and which is practically, if not altogether ignored by Mr. Darwin),\r\nis the instinctive inclination which induces individuals of the same\r\nspecies by preference to intercross with those possessing the qualities\r\nwhich they themselves want, so as to preserve the purity or equilibrium\r\nof the breed... It is trite to a proverb, that tall men marry little\r\nwomen... a man of genius marries a fool... and we are told that this is\r\nthe result of the charm of contrast, or of qualities admired in others\r\nbecause we do not possess them. I do not so explain it. I imagine it is\r\nthe effort of nature to preserve the typical medium of the race.\")\r\nIt includes speculations (which he perhaps will modify) so rash, and\r\nwithout a single fact in support, that had I advanced them he or other\r\nreviewers would have hit me very hard. I am sorry to say that I have\r\nno \"consolatory view\" on the dignity of man. I am content that man will\r\nprobably advance, and care not much whether we are looked at as mere\r\nsavages in a remotely distant future. Many thanks for your last note.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI have received, in a Manchester newspaper, rather a good squib, showing\r\nthat I have proved \"might is right,\" and therefore that Napoleon is\r\nright, and every cheating tradesman is also right.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.B. CARPENTER. Down, January 6th [1860]?\r\n\r\nMy dear Carpenter,\r\n\r\nI have just read your excellent article in the 'National.' It will do\r\ngreat good; especially if it becomes known as your production. It seems\r\nto me to give an excellently clear account of Mr. Wallace's and my\r\nviews. How capitally you turn the flanks of the theological opposers by\r\nopposing to them such men as Bentham and the more philosophical of the\r\nsystematists! I thank you sincerely for the EXTREMELY honourable\r\nmanner in which you mention me. I should have liked to have seen some\r\ncriticisms or remarks on embryology, on which subject you are so well\r\ninstructed. I do not think any candid person can read your article\r\nwithout being much impressed with it. The old doctrine of immutability\r\nof specific forms will surely but slowly die away. It is a shame to\r\ngive you trouble, but I should be very much obliged if you could tell me\r\nwhere differently coloured eggs in individuals of the cuckoo have been\r\ndescribed, and their laying in twent-seven kinds of nests. Also do you\r\nknow from your own observation that the limbs of sheep imported into\r\nthe West Indies change colour? I have had detailed information about the\r\nloss of wool; but my accounts made the change slower than you describe.\r\n\r\nWith most cordial thanks and respect, believe me, my dear Carpenter,\r\nyours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO L. JENYNS. (Rev. L. Blomefield.) Down, January 7th,\r\n1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Jenyns,\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your letter. It is of great use and interest\r\nto me to know what impression my book produces on philosophical and\r\ninstructed minds. I thank you for the kind things which you say; and you\r\ngo with me much further than I expected. You will think it presumptuous,\r\nbut I am convinced, IF CIRCUMSTANCES LEAD YOU TO KEEP THE SUBJECT\r\nIN MIND, that you will go further. No one has yet cast doubts on my\r\nexplanation of the subordination of group to group, on homologies,\r\nembryology, and rudimentary organs; and if my explanation of these\r\nclasses of facts be at all right, whole classes of organic beings must\r\nbe included in one line of descent.\r\n\r\nThe imperfection of the Geological Record is one of the greatest\r\ndifficulties... During the earliest period the record would be most\r\nimperfect, and this seems to me sufficient to account for our not\r\nfinding intermediate forms between the classes in the same great\r\nkingdoms. It was certainly rash in me putting in my belief of the\r\nprobability of all beings having descended from ONE primordial form;\r\nbut as this seems yet to me probable, I am not willing to strike it out.\r\nHuxley alone supports me in this, and something could be said in its\r\nfavour. With respect to man, I am very far from wishing to obtrude\r\nmy belief; but I thought it dishonest to quite conceal my opinion.\r\nOf course it is open to every one to believe that man appeared by\r\na separate miracle, though I do not myself see the necessity or\r\nprobability.\r\n\r\nPray accept my sincere thanks for your kind note. Your going some way\r\nwith me gives me great confidence that I am not very wrong. For a very\r\nlong time I halted half way; but I do not believe that any enquiring\r\nmind will rest half-way. People will have to reject all or admit all; by\r\nALL I mean only the members of each great kingdom.\r\n\r\nMy dear Jenyns, yours most sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, January 10th [1860].\r\n\r\n... It is perfectly true that I owe nearly all the corrections (The\r\nsecond edition of 3000 copies of the 'Origin' was published on January\r\n7th.) to you, and several verbal ones to you and others; I am heartily\r\nglad you approve of them, as yet only two things have annoyed me;\r\nthose confounded millions (This refers to the passage in the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies' (2nd edition, page 285), in which the lapse of time implied by\r\nthe denudation of the Weald is discussed. The discussion closes with the\r\nsentence: \"So that it is not improbable that a longer period than\r\n300 million years has elapsed since the latter part of the Secondary\r\nperiod.\" This passage is omitted in the later editions of the 'Origin,'\r\nagainst the advice of some of his friends, as appears from the pencil\r\nnotes in my father's copy of the second edition.) of years (not that\r\nI think it is probably wrong), and my not having (by inadvertance)\r\nmentioned Wallace towards the close of the book in the summary, not that\r\nany one has noticed this to me. I have now put in Wallace's name at page\r\n484 in a conspicuous place. I cannot refer you to tables of mortality\r\nof children, etc. etc. I have notes somewhere, but I have not the LEAST\r\nidea where to hunt, and my notes would now be old. I shall be truly\r\nglad to read carefully any MS. on man, and give my opinion. You used to\r\ncaution me to be cautious about man. I suspect I shall have to return\r\nthe caution a hundred fold! Yours will, no doubt, be a grand discussion;\r\nbut it will horrify the world at first more than my whole volume;\r\nalthough by the sentence (page 489, new edition (First edition, page\r\n488.)) I show that I believe man is in the same predicament with other\r\nanimals. It is, in fact, impossible to doubt it. I have thought (only\r\nvaguely) on man. With respect to the races, one of my best chances of\r\ntruth has broken down from the impossibility of getting facts. I have\r\none good speculative line, but a man must have entire credence in\r\nNatural Selection before he will even listen to it. Psychologically, I\r\nhave done scarcely anything. Unless, indeed, expression of countenance\r\ncan be included, and on that subject I have collected a good many facts,\r\nand speculated, but I do not suppose I shall ever publish, but it is an\r\nuncommonly curious subject. By the way, I sent off a lot of questions\r\nthe day before yesterday to Tierra del Fuego on expression! I suspect\r\n(for I have never read it) that Spencer's 'Psychology' has a bearing on\r\nPsychology as we should look at it. By all means read the Preface, in\r\nabout 20 pages, of Hensleigh Wedgwood's new Dictionary on the first\r\norigin of Language; Erasmus would lend it. I agree about Carpenter,\r\na very good article, but with not much original... Andrew Murray has\r\ncriticised, in an address to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, the\r\nnotice in the 'Linnean Journal,' and \"has disposed of\" the whole theory\r\nby an ingenious difficulty, which I was very stupid not to have thought\r\nof; for I express surprise at more and analogous cases not being known.\r\nThe difficulty is, that amongst the blind insects of the caves in\r\ndistant parts of the world there are some of the same genus, and yet the\r\ngenus is not found out of the caves or living in the free world. I have\r\nlittle doubt that, like the fish Amblyopsis, and like Proteus in Europe,\r\nthese insects are \"wrecks of ancient life,\" or \"living fossils,\" saved\r\nfrom competition and extermination. But that formerly SEEING insects\r\nof the same genus roamed over the whole area in which the cases are\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nFarewell, yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--OUR ancestor was an animal which breathed water, had a swim\r\nbladder, a great swimming tail, an imperfect skull, and undoubtedly was\r\nan hermaphrodite!\r\n\r\nHere is a pleasant genealogy for mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, January 14th [1860].\r\n\r\n... I shall be much interested in reading your man discussion, and will\r\ngive my opinion carefully, whatever that may be worth; but I have so\r\nlong looked at you as the type of cautious scientific judgment (to my\r\nmind one of the highest and most useful qualities), that I suspect my\r\nopinion will be superfluous. It makes me laugh to think what a joke\r\nit will be if I have to caution you, after your cautions on the same\r\nsubject to me!\r\n\r\nI will order Owen's book ('Classification of the Mammalia,' 1859.); I am\r\nvery glad to hear Huxley's opinion on his classification of man; without\r\nhaving due knowledge, it seemed to me from the very first absurd; all\r\nclassifications founded on single characters I believe have failed.\r\n\r\n... What a grand, immense benefit you conferred on me by getting Murray\r\nto publish my book. I never till to-day realised that it was getting\r\nwidely distributed; for in a letter from a lady to-day to E., she says\r\nshe heard a man enquiring for it at the RAILWAY STATION!!! at Waterloo\r\nBridge; and the bookseller said that he had none till the new edition\r\nwas out. The bookseller said he had not read it, but had heard it was a\r\nvery remarkable book!!!...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, 14th [January, 1860].\r\n\r\n... I heard from Lyell this morning, and he tells me a piece of news. You\r\nare a good-for-nothing man; here you are slaving yourself to death with\r\nhardly a minute to spare, and you must write a review of my book! I\r\nthought it ('Gardeners' Chronicle', 1860. Referred to above. Sir J.D.\r\nHooker took the line of complete impartiality, so as not to commit\r\nLindley.) a very good one, and was so much struck with it that I sent it\r\nto Lyell. But I assumed, as a matter of course, that it was Lindley's.\r\nNow that I know it is yours, I have re-read it, and, my kind and good\r\nfriend, it has warmed my heart with all the honourable and noble things\r\nyou say of me and it. I was a good deal surprised at Lindley hitting on\r\nsome of the remarks, but I never dreamed of you. I admired it chiefly\r\nas so well adapted to tell on the readers of the 'Gardeners' Chronicle';\r\nbut now I admired it in another spirit. Farewell, with hearty\r\nthanks... Lyell is going at man with an audacity that frightens me. It is\r\na good joke; he used always to caution me to slip over man.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\", January 21, 1860, appeared a short\r\nletter from my father which was called forth by Mr. Westwood's\r\ncommunication to the previous number of the journal, in which certain\r\nphenomena of cros-breeding are discussed in relation to the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies.' Mr. Westwood wrote in reply (February 11) and adduced further\r\nevidence against the doctrine of descent, such as the identity of the\r\nfigures of ostriches on the ancient \"Egyptian records,\" with the bird as\r\nwe now know it. The correspondence is hardly worth mentioning, except as\r\none of the very few cases in which my father was enticed into anything\r\nresembling a controversy.]\r\n\r\n\r\nASA GRAY TO J.D. HOOKER. Cambridge, Mass., January 5th, 1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYour last letter, which reached me just before Christmas, has got\r\nmislaid during the upturnings in my study which take place at that\r\nseason, and has not yet been discovered. I should be very sorry to lose\r\nit, for there were in it some botanical mems. which I had not secured...\r\n\r\nThe principal part of your letter was high laudation of Darwin's book.\r\n\r\nWell, the book has reached me, and I finished its careful perusal four\r\ndays ago; and I freely say that your laudation is not out of place.\r\n\r\nIt is done in a MASTERLY MANNER. It might well have taken twenty years\r\nto produce it. It is crammed full of most interesting matter--thoroughly\r\ndigested--well expressed--close, cogent, and taken as a system it makes\r\nout a better case than I had supposed possible...\r\n\r\nAgassiz, when I saw him last, had read but a part of it. He says it is\r\nPOOR--VERY POOR!! (entre nous). The fact [is] he is very much annoyed by\r\nit,... and I do not wonder at it. To bring all IDEAL systems within the\r\ndomain of science, and give good physical or natural explanations of\r\nall his capital points, is as bad as to have Forbes take the glacier\r\nmaterials... and give scientific explanation of all the phenomena.\r\n\r\nTell Darwin all this. I will write to him when I get a chance. As I have\r\npromised, he and you shall have fair-play here... I must myself write\r\na review of Darwin's book for 'Silliman's Journal' (the more so that I\r\nsuspect Agassiz means to come out upon it) for the next (March) No., and\r\nI am now setting about it (when I ought to be every moment working the\r\nExpl[oring] Expedition Compositae, which I know far more about). And\r\nreally it is no easy job, as you may well imagine.\r\n\r\nI doubt if I shall please you altogether. I know I shall not please\r\nAgassiz at all. I hear another reprint is in the Press, and the book\r\nwill excite much attention here, and some controversy...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, January 28th [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nHooker has forwarded to me your letter to him; and I cannot express how\r\ndeeply it has gratified me. To receive the approval of a man whom one\r\nhas long sincerely respected. And whose judgment and knowledge are most\r\nuniversally admitted, is the highest reward an author can possibly wish\r\nfor; and I thank you heartily for your most kind expressions.\r\n\r\nI have been absent from home for a few days, and so could not earlier\r\nanswer your letter to me of the 10th of January. You have been extremely\r\nkind to take so much trouble and interest about the edition. It has been\r\na mistake of my publisher not thinking of sending over the sheets. I\r\nhad entirely and utterly forgotten your offer of receiving the sheets\r\nas printed off. But I must not blame my publisher, for had I remembered\r\nyour most kind offer I feel pretty sure I should not have taken\r\nadvantage of it; for I never dreamed of my book being so successful with\r\ngeneral readers; I believe I should have laughed at the idea of sending\r\nthe sheets to America. (In a letter to Mr. Murray, 1860, my father\r\nwrote:--\"I am amused by Asa Gray's account of the excitement my book has\r\nmade amongst naturalists in the United States. Agassiz has denounced\r\nit in a newspaper, but yet in such terms that it is in fact a fine\r\nadvertisement!\" This seems to refer to a lecture given before the\r\nMercantile Library Association.)\r\n\r\nAfter much consideration, and on the strong advice of Lyell and others,\r\nI have resolved to leave the present book as it is (excepting correcting\r\nerrors, or here and there inserting short sentences) and to use all my\r\nstrength, WHICH IS BUT LITTLE, to bring out the first part (forming a\r\nseparate volume with index, etc.) of the three volumes which will make\r\nmy bigger work; so that I am very unwilling to take up time in\r\nmaking corrections for an American edition. I enclose a list of a few\r\ncorrections in the second reprint, which you will have received by this\r\ntime complete, and I could send four or five corrections or additions of\r\nequally small importance, or rather of equal brevity. I also intend to\r\nwrite a SHORT preface with a brief history of the subject. These I will\r\nset about, as they must some day be done, and I will send them to you\r\nin a short time--the few corrections first, and the preface afterwards,\r\nunless I hear that you have given up all idea of a separate edition. You\r\nwill then be able to judge whether it is worth having the new edition\r\nwith YOUR REVIEW PREFIXED. Whatever be the nature of your review,\r\nI assure you I should feel it a GREAT honour to have my book thus\r\npreceded...\r\n\r\n\r\nASA GRAY TO CHARLES DARWIN. Cambridge, January 23rd, 1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nYou have my hurried letter telling you of the arrival of the remainder\r\nof the sheets of the reprint, and of the stir I had made for a reprint\r\nin Boston. Well, all looked pretty well, when, lo, we found that a\r\nsecond New York publishing house had announced a reprint also! I wrote\r\nthen to both New York publishers, asking them to give way to the AUTHOR\r\nand his reprint of a revised edition. I got an answer from the Harpers\r\nthat they withdraw --from the Appletons that they had got the book OUT\r\n(and the next day I saw a copy); but that, \"if the work should have\r\nany considerable sale, we certainly shall be disposed to pay the author\r\nreasonably and liberally.\"\r\n\r\nThe Appletons being thus out with their reprint, the Boston house\r\ndeclined to go on. So I wrote to the Appletons taking them at their\r\nword, offering to aid their reprint, to give them the use of the\r\nalterations in the London reprint, as soon as I find out what they are,\r\netc. etc. And I sent them the first leaf, and asked them to insert in\r\ntheir future issue the additional matter from Butler (A quotation from\r\nButler's 'Analogy,' on the use of the word natural, which in the second\r\nedition is placed with the passages from Whewell and Bacon on page ii,\r\nopposite the title-page.), which tells just right. So there the matter\r\nstands. If you furnish any matter in advance of the London third\r\nedition, I will make them pay for it.\r\n\r\nI may get something for you. All got is clear gain; but it will not be\r\nvery much, I suppose.\r\n\r\nSuch little notices in the papers here as have yet appeared are quite\r\nhandsome and considerate.\r\n\r\nI hope next week to get printed sheets of my review from New Haven, and\r\nsend [them] to you, and will ask you to pass them on to Dr. Hooker.\r\n\r\nTo fulfil your request, I ought to tell you what I think the weakest,\r\nand what the best, part of your book. But this is not easy, nor to be\r\ndone in a word or two. The BEST PART, I think, is the WHOLE, i.e.,\r\nits PLAN and TREATMENT, the vast amount of facts and acute inferences\r\nhandled as if you had a perfect mastery of them. I do not think twenty\r\nyears too much time to produce such a book in.\r\n\r\nStyle clear and good, but now and then wants revision for little matters\r\n(page 97, self-fertilises ITSELF, etc.).\r\n\r\nThen your candour is worth everything to your cause. It is refreshing\r\nto find a person with a new theory who frankly confesses that he finds\r\ndifficulties, insurmountable, at least for the present. I know some\r\npeople who never have any difficulties to speak of.\r\n\r\nThe moment I understood your premisses, I felt sure you had a real\r\nfoundation to hold on. Well, if one admits your premisses, I do not see\r\nhow he is to stop short of your conclusions, as a probable hypothesis at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nIt naturally happens that my review of your book does not exhibit\r\nanything like the full force of the impression the book has made upon\r\nme. Under the circumstances I suppose I do your theory more good\r\nhere, by bespeaking for it a fair and favourable consideration, and by\r\nstanding non-committed as to its full conclusions, than I should if I\r\nannounced myself a convert; nor could I say the latter, with truth.\r\n\r\nWell, what seems to me the weakest point in the book is the attempt\r\nto account for the formation of organs, the making of eyes, etc., by\r\nnatural selection. Some of this reads quite Lamarckian.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on HYBRIDISM is not a WEAK, but a STRONG chapter. You have\r\ndone wonders there. But still you have not accounted, as you may be held\r\nto account, for divergence up to a certain extent producing increased\r\nfertility of the crosses, but carried one short almost imperceptible\r\nstep more, giving rise to sterility, or reversing the tendency. Very\r\nlikely you are on the right track; but you have something to do yet in\r\nthat department.\r\n\r\nEnough for the present.\r\n\r\n... I am not insensible to your compliments, the very high compliment\r\nwhich you pay me in valuing my opinion. You evidently think more of it\r\nthan I do, though from the way I write [to] you, and especially [to]\r\nHooker, this might not be inferred from the reading of my letters.\r\n\r\nI am free to say that I never learnt so much from one book as I have\r\nfrom yours, there remain a thousand things I long to say about it.\r\n\r\nEver yours, ASA GRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. [February? 1860].\r\n\r\n... Now I will just run through some points in your letter. What you say\r\nabout my book gratifies me most deeply, and I wish I could feel all was\r\ndeserved by me. I quite think a review from a man, who is not an entire\r\nconvert, if fair and moderately favourable, is in all respects the best\r\nkind of review. About the weak points I agree. The eye to this day gives\r\nme a cold shudder, but when I think of the fine known gradations, my\r\nreason tells me I ought to conquer the cold shudder.\r\n\r\nPray kindly remember and tell Prof. Wyman how very grateful I should be\r\nfor any hints, information, or criticisms. I have the highest respect\r\nfor his opinion. I am so sorry about Dana's health. I have already asked\r\nhim to pay me a visit.\r\n\r\nFarewell, you have laid me under a load of obligation--not that I feel\r\nit a load. It is the highest possible gratification to me to think that\r\nyou have found my book worth reading and reflection; for you and three\r\nothers I put down in my own mind as the judges whose opinions I should\r\nvalue most of all.\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray, yours most sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I feel pretty sure, from my own experience, that if you are led\r\nby your studies to keep the subject of the origin of species before your\r\nmind, you will go further and further in your belief. It took me long\r\nyears, and I assure you I am astonished at the impression my book has\r\nmade on many minds. I fear twenty years ago, I should not have been half\r\nas candid and open to conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [January 31st, 1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have resolved to publish a little sketch of the progress of opinion on\r\nthe change of species. Will you or Mrs. Hooker do me the favour to copy\r\nONE sentence out of Naudin's paper in the 'Revue Horticole,' 1852, page\r\n103, namely, that on his principle of Finalite. Can you let me have it\r\nsoon, with those confounded dashes over the vowels put in carefully? Asa\r\nGray, I believe, is going to get a second edition of my book, and I want\r\nto send this little preface over to him soon. I did not think of the\r\nnecessity of having Naudin's sentence on finality, otherwise I would\r\nhave copied it.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I shall end by just alluding to your Australian Flora\r\nIntroduction. What was the date of publication: December 1859, or\r\nJanuary 1860? Please answer this.\r\n\r\nMy preface will also do for the French edition, which I BELIEVE, is\r\nagreed on.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. February [1860].\r\n\r\n... As the 'Origin' now stands, Harvey's (William Henry Harvey was\r\ndescended from a Quaker family of Youghal, and was born in February,\r\n1811, at Summerville, a country house on the banks of the Shannon. He\r\ndied at Torquay in 1866. In 1835, Harvey went to Africa (Table Bay) to\r\npursue his botanical studies, the results of which were given in his\r\n'Genera of South African Plants.' In 1838, ill-health compelled him to\r\nobtain leave of absence, and return to England for a time; in 1840 he\r\nreturned to Cape Town, to be again compelled by illness to leave. In\r\n1843 he obtained the appointment of Botanical Professor at Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin. In 1854, 1855, and 1856 he visited Australia, New\r\nZealand, the Friendly and Fiji Islands. In 1857 Dr. Harvey reached home,\r\nand was appointed the successor of Professor Allman to the Chair of\r\nBotany in Dublin University. He was author of several botanical works,\r\nprincipally on Algae.--(From a Memoir published in 1869.)) is a good\r\nhit against my talking so much of the insensibly fine gradations; and\r\ncertainly it has astonished me that I should be pelted with the fact,\r\nthat I had not allowed abrupt and great enough variations under nature.\r\nIt would take a good deal more evidence to make me admit that forms have\r\noften changed by saltum.\r\n\r\nHave you seen Wollaston's attack in the 'Annals'? ('Annals and Magazine\r\nof Natural History,' 1860.) The stones are beginning to fly. But\r\nTheology has more to do with these two attacks than Science...\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the above letter a paper by Harvey in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\",\r\nFebruary 18, 1860, is alluded to. He describes a case of monstrosity\r\nin Begonia frigida, in which the \"sport\" differed so much from a normal\r\nBegonia that it might have served as the type of a distinct natural\r\norder. Harvey goes on to argue that such a case is hostile to the theory\r\nof natural selection, according to which changes are not supposed to\r\ntake place per saltum, and adds that \"a few such cases would overthrow\r\nit [Mr. Darwin's hypothesis] altogether.\" In the following number of\r\nthe \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" Sir J.D. Hooker showed that Dr. Harvey had\r\nmisconceived the bearing of the Begonia case, which he further showed\r\nto be by no means calculated to shake the validity of the doctrine\r\nof modification by means of natural selection. My father mentions the\r\nBegonia case in a letter to Lyell (February 18, 1860):--\r\n\r\n\"I send by this post an attack in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\", by Harvey\r\n(a first-rate Botanist, as you probably know). It seems to me rather\r\nstrange; he assumes the permanence of monsters, whereas, monsters are\r\ngenerally sterile, and not often inheritable. But grant his case, it\r\ncomes that I have been too cautious in not admitting great and sudden\r\nvariations. Here again comes in the mischief of my ABSTRACT. In the\r\nfuller MS. I have discussed a parallel case of a normal fish like the\r\nmonstrous gold-fish.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to Sir J.D. Hooker's reply, my father wrote:]\r\n\r\nDown, [February 26th, 1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYour answer to Harvey seems to me ADMIRABLY good. You would have made a\r\ngigantic fortune as a barrister. What an omission of Harvey's about the\r\ngraduated state of the flowers! But what strikes me most is that surely\r\nI ought to know my own book best, yet, by Jove, you have brought forward\r\never so many arguments which I did not think of! Your reference to\r\nclassification (viz. I presume to such cases as Aspicarpa) is EXCELLENT,\r\nfor the monstrous Begonia no doubt in all details would be Begonia. I\r\ndid not think of this, nor of the RETROGRADE step from separated sexes\r\nto an hermaphrodite state; nor of the lessened fertility of the monster.\r\nProh pudor to me.\r\n\r\nThe world would say what a lawyer has been lost in a MERE botanist!\r\n\r\nFarewell, my dear master in my own subject,\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI am so heartily pleased to see that you approve of the chapter on\r\nClassification.\r\n\r\nI wonder what Harvey will say. But no one hardly, I think, is able at\r\nfirst to see when he is beaten in an argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letters refer to the first translation (1860) of the\r\n'Origin of Species' into German, which was superintended by H.G. Bronn,\r\na good zoologist and palaeontologist, who was at the time at Freiburg,\r\nbut afterwards Professor at Heidelberg. I have been told that the\r\ntranslation was not a success, it remained an obvious translation, and\r\nwas correspondingly unpleasant to read. Bronn added to the translation\r\nan appendix of the difficulties that occurred to him. For instance,\r\nhow can natural selection account for differences between species, when\r\nthese differences appear to be of no service to their possessors; e.g.,\r\nthe length of the ears and tail, or the folds in the enamel of the teeth\r\nof various species of rodents? Krause, in his book, 'Charles Darwin,'\r\npage 91, criticises Bronn's conduct in this manner, but it will be seen\r\nthat my father actually suggested the addition of Bronn's remarks. A\r\nmore serious charge against Bronn made by Krause (op. cit. page 87) is\r\nthat he left out passages of which he did not approve, as, for instance,\r\nthe passage ('Origin,' first edition, page 488) \"Light will be thrown on\r\nthe origin of man and his history.\" I have no evidence as to whether my\r\nfather did or did not know of these alterations.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO H.G. BRONN. Down, February 4 [1860].\r\n\r\nDear and much honoured Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your most kind letter; I feared that you would\r\nmuch disapprove of the 'Origin,' and I sent it to you merely as a mark\r\nof my sincere respect. I shall read with much interest your work on the\r\nproductions of Islands whenever I receive it. I thank you cordially for\r\nthe notice in the 'Neues Jahrbuch fur Mineralogie,' and still more for\r\nspeaking to Schweitzerbart about a translation; for I am most anxious\r\nthat the great and intellectual German people should know something\r\nabout my book.\r\n\r\nI have told my publisher to send immediately a copy of the NEW\r\n(Second edition.) edition to Schweitzerbart, and I have written to\r\nSchweitzerbart that I gave up all right to profit for myself, so that I\r\nhope a translation will appear. I fear that the book will be difficult\r\nto translate, and if you could advise Schweitzerbart about a GOOD\r\ntranslator, it would be of very great service. Still more, if you would\r\nrun your eye over the more difficult parts of the translation; but this\r\nis too great a favour to expect. I feel sure that it will be difficult\r\nto translate, from being so much condensed.\r\n\r\nAgain I thank you for your noble and generous sympathy, and I remain,\r\nwith entire respect,\r\n\r\nYours, truly obliged, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--The new edition has some few corrections, and I will send in\r\nMS. some additional corrections, and a short historical preface, to\r\nSchweitzerbart.\r\n\r\nHow interesting you could make the work by EDITING (I do not\r\nmean translating) the work, and appending notes of REFUTATION or\r\nconfirmation. The book has sold so very largely in England, that an\r\neditor would, I think, make profit by the translation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO H.G. BRONN. Down, February 14 [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear and much honoured Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you cordially for your extreme kindness in superintending the\r\ntranslation. I have mentioned this to some eminent scientific men, and\r\nthey all agree that you have done a noble and generous service. If I am\r\nproved quite wrong, yet I comfort myself in thinking that my book may\r\ndo some good, as truth can only be known by rising victorious from every\r\nattack. I thank you also much for the review, and for the kind manner\r\nin which you speak of me. I send with this letter some corrections and\r\nadditions to M. Schweitzerbart, and a short historical preface. I am\r\nnot much acquainted with German authors, as I read German very slowly;\r\ntherefore I do not know whether any Germans have advocated similar\r\nviews with mine; if they have, would you do me the favour to insert a\r\nfoot-note to the preface? M. Schweitzerbart has now the reprint ready\r\nfor a translator to begin. Several scientific men have thought the term\r\n\"Natural Selection\" good, because its meaning is NOT obvious, and each\r\nman could not put on it his own interpretation, and because it at\r\nonce connects variation under domestication and nature. Is there any\r\nanalogous term used by German breeders of animals? \"Adelung,\" ennobling,\r\nwould, perhaps, be too metaphysical. It is folly in me, but I cannot\r\nhelp doubting whether \"Wahl der Lebensweise\" expresses my notion. It\r\nleaves the impression on my mind of the Lamarckian doctrine (which I\r\nreject) of habits of life being al-important. Man has altered, and\r\nthus improved the English race-horse by SELECTING successive fleeter\r\nindividuals; and I believe, owing to the struggle for existence, that\r\nsimilar SLIGHT variations in a wild horse, IF ADVANTAGEOUS TO IT, would\r\nbe SELECTED or PRESERVED by nature; hence Natural Selection. But I\r\napologise for troubling you with these remarks on the importance of\r\nchoosing good German terms for \"Natural Selection.\" With my heartfelt\r\nthanks, and with sincere respect,\r\n\r\nI remain, dear Sir, yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO H.G. BRONN. Down, July 14 [1860].\r\n\r\nDear and honoured Sir,\r\n\r\nOn my return home, after an absence of some time, I found the\r\ntranslation of the third part (The German translation was published in\r\nthree pamphle-like numbers.) of the 'Origin,' and I have been delighted\r\nto see a final chapter of criticisms by yourself. I have read the first\r\nfew paragraphs and final paragraph, and am perfectly contented, indeed\r\nmore than contented, with the generous and candid spirit with which you\r\nhave considered my views. You speak with too much praise of my work.\r\nI shall, of course, carefully read the whole chapter; but though I can\r\nread descriptive books like Gaertner's pretty easily, when any reasoning\r\ncomes in, I find German excessively difficult to understand. At some\r\nFUTURE time I should very much like to hear how my book has been\r\nreceived in Germany, and I most sincerely hope M. Schweitzerbart\r\nwill not lose money by the publication. Most of the reviews have been\r\nbitterly opposed to me in England, yet I have made some converts, and\r\nSEVERAL naturalists who would not believe in a word of it, are now\r\ncoming slightly round, and admit that natural selection may have done\r\nsomething. This gives me hope that more will ultimately come round to a\r\ncertain extent to my views.\r\n\r\nI shall ever consider myself deeply indebted to you for the immense\r\nservice and honour which you have conferred on me in making the\r\nexcellent translation of my book. Pray believe me, with most sincere\r\nrespect,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, yours gratefully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, [February 12th, 1860].\r\n\r\n... I think it was a great pity that Huxley wasted so much time in the\r\nlecture on the preliminary remarks;... but his lecture seemed to me very\r\nfine and very bold. I have remonstrated (and he agrees) against the\r\nimpression that he would leave, that sterility was a universal and\r\ninfallible criterion of species.\r\n\r\nYou will, I am sure, make a grand discussion on man. I am so glad to\r\nhear that you and Lady Lyell will come here. Pray fix your own time; and\r\nif it did not suit us we would say so. We could then discuss man well...\r\n\r\nHow much I owe to you and Hooker! I do not suppose I should hardly ever\r\nhave published had it not been for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The lecture referred to in the last letter was given at the Royal\r\nInstitution, February 10, 1860. The following letter was written\r\nin reply to Mr. Huxley's request for information about breeding,\r\nhybridisation, etc. It is of interest as giving a vivid retrospect of\r\nthe writer's experience on the subject.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Ilkley, Yorks, November 27 [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nGartner grand, Kolreuter grand, but papers scattered through many\r\nvolumes and very lengthy. I had to make an abstract of the whole.\r\nHerbert's volume on Amaryllidaceae very good, and two excellent papers\r\nin the 'Horticultural Journal.' For animals, no resume to be trusted at\r\nall; facts are to be collected from all original sources. (This caution\r\nis exemplified in the following extract from an earlier letter to\r\nProfessor Huxley:--\"The inaccuracy of the blessed gang (of which I\r\nam one) of compilers passes all bounds. MONSTERS have frequently been\r\ndescribed as hybrids without a tittle of evidence. I must give one other\r\ncase to show how we jolly fellows work. A Belgian Baron (I forget his\r\nname at this moment) crossed two distinct geese and got SEVEN hybrids,\r\nwhich he proved subsequently to be quite sterile; well, compiler\r\nthe first, Chevreul, says that the hybrids were propagated for SEVEN\r\ngenerations inter se. Compiler second (Morton) mistakes the French name,\r\nand gives Latin names for two more distinct geese, and says CHEVREUL\r\nhimself propagated them inter se for seven generations; and the latter\r\nstatement is copied from book to book.\") I fear my MS. for the bigger\r\nbook (twice or thrice as long as in present book), with all references,\r\nwould be illegible, but it would save you infinite labour; of course I\r\nwould gladly lend it, but I have no copy, so care would have to be taken\r\nof it. But my accursed handwriting would be fatal, I fear.\r\n\r\nAbout breeding, I know of no one book. I did not think well of Lowe,\r\nbut I can name none better. Youatt I look at as a far better and MORE\r\nPRACTICAL authority; but then his views and facts are scattered through\r\nthree or four thick volumes. I have picked up most by reading really\r\nnumberless special treatises and ALL agricultural and horticultural\r\njournals; but it is a work of long years. THE DIFFICULTY IS TO KNOW WHAT\r\nTO TRUST. No one or two statements are worth a farthing; the facts are\r\nso complicated. I hope and think I have been really cautious in what I\r\nstate on this subject, although all that I have given, as yet, is FAR\r\ntoo briefly. I have found it very important associating with fanciers\r\nand breeders. For instance, I sat one evening in a gin palace in the\r\nBorough amongst a set of pigeon fanciers, when it was hinted that Mr.\r\nBull had crossed his Pouters with Runts to gain size; and if you had\r\nseen the solemn, the mysterious, and awful shakes of the head which\r\nall the fanciers gave at this scandalous proceeding, you would have\r\nrecognised how little crossing has had to do with improving breeds,\r\nand how dangerous for endless generations the process was. All this was\r\nbrought home far more vividly than by pages of mere statements, etc.\r\nBut I am scribbling foolishly. I really do not know how to advise about\r\ngetting up facts on breeding and improving breeds. Go to Shows is one\r\nway. Read ALL treatises on any ONE domestic animal, and believe nothing\r\nwithout largely confirmed. For your lectures I can give you a few\r\namusing anecdotes and sentences, if you want to make the audience laugh.\r\n\r\nI thank you particularly for telling me what naturalists think. If we\r\ncan once make a compact set of believers we shall in time conquer. I\r\nam EMINENTLY glad Ramsey is on our side, for he is, in my opinion, a\r\nfirs-rate geologist. I sent him a copy. I hope he got it. I shall be\r\nvery curious to hear whether any effect has been produced on Prestwich;\r\nI sent him a copy, not as a friend, but owing to a sentence or two in\r\nsome paper, which made me suspect he was doubting.\r\n\r\nRev. C. Kingsley has a mind to come round. Quatrefages writes that he\r\ngoes some long way with me; says he exhibited diagrams like mine. With\r\nmost hearty thanks,\r\n\r\nYours very tired, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[I give the conclusion of Professor Huxley's lecture, as being one of\r\nthe earliest, as well as one of the most eloquent of his utterances in\r\nsupport of the 'Origin of Species']:\r\n\r\n\"I have said that the man of science is the sworn interpreter of nature\r\nin the high court of reason. But of what avail is his honest speech, if\r\nignorance is the assessor of the judge, and prejudice the foreman of the\r\njury? I hardly know of a great physical truth, whose universal reception\r\nhas not been preceded by an epoch in which most estimable persons have\r\nmaintained that the phenomena investigated were directly dependent on\r\nthe Divine Will, and that the attempt to investigate them was not only\r\nfutile, but blasphemous. And there is a wonderful tenacity of life about\r\nthis sort of opposition to physical science. Crushed and maimed in every\r\nbattle, it yet seems never to be slain; and after a hundred defeats it\r\nis at this day as rampant, though happily not so mischievous, as in the\r\ntime of Galileo.\r\n\r\n\"But to those whose life is spent, to use Newton's noble words, in\r\npicking up here a pebble and there a pebble on the shores of the great\r\nocean of truth--who watch, day by day, the slow but sure advance of that\r\nmighty tide, bearing on its bosom the thousand treasures wherewith man\r\nennobles and beautifies his life--it would be laughable, if it were not\r\nso sad, to see the little Canutes of the hour enthroned in solemn state,\r\nbidding that great wave to stay, and threatening to check its beneficent\r\nprogress. The wave rises and they fly; but, unlike the brave old Dane,\r\nthey learn no lesson of humility: the throne is pitched at what seems a\r\nsafe distance, and the folly is repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Surely it is the duty of the public to discourage anything of this\r\nkind, to discredit these foolish meddlers who think they do the Almighty\r\na service by preventing a thorough study of His works.\r\n\r\n\"The Origin of Species is not the first, and it will not be the last, of\r\nthe great questions born of science, which will demand settlement from\r\nthis generation. The general mind is seething strangely, and to those\r\nwho watch the signs of the times, it seems plain that this nineteenth\r\ncentury will see revolutions of thought and practice as great as those\r\nwhich the sixteenth witnessed. Through what trials and sore contests the\r\ncivilised world will have to pass in the course of this new reformation,\r\nwho can tell?\r\n\r\n\"But I verily believe that come what will, the part which England may\r\nplay in the battle is a grand and a noble one. She may prove to the\r\nworld that, for one people, at any rate, despotism and demagogy are not\r\nthe necessary alternatives of government; that freedom and order are\r\nnot incompatible; that reverence is the handmaid of knowledge; that free\r\ndiscussion is the life of truth, and of true unity in a nation.\r\n\r\n\"Will England play this part? That depends upon how you, the public,\r\ndeal with science. Cherish her, venerate her, follow her methods\r\nfaithfully and implicitly in their application to all branches of human\r\nthought, and the future of this people will be greater than the past.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to those who would silence and crush her, and I fear our\r\nchildren will see the glory of England vanishing like Arthur in the\r\nmist; they will cry too late the woful cry of Guinever:--\r\n\r\n     'It was my duty to have loved the highest;\r\n     It surely was my profit had I known;\r\n     It would have been my pleasure had I seen.'\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down [February 15th, 1860].\r\n\r\n... I am perfectly convinced (having read this morning) that the review\r\nin the 'Annals' (Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist. third series, vol. 5,\r\npage 132. My father has obviously taken the expression \"pestilent\" from\r\nthe following passage (page 138): \"But who is this Nature, we have a\r\nright to ask, who has such tremendous power, and to whose efficiency\r\nsuch marvellous performances are ascribed? What are her image and\r\nattributes, when dragged from her wordy lurking-place? Is she aught\r\nbut a pestilent abstraction, like dust cast in our eyes to obscure the\r\nworkings of an Intelligent First Cause of all?\" The reviewer pays a\r\ntribute to my father's candour, \"so manly and outspoken as almost to\r\n'cover a multitude of sins.'\" The parentheses (to which allusion is made\r\nabove) are so frequent as to give a characteristic appearance to Mr.\r\nWollaston's pages.) is by Wollaston; no one else in the world would have\r\nused so many parentheses. I have written to him, and told him that the\r\n\"pestilent\" fellow thanks him for his kind manner of speaking about him.\r\nI have also told him that he would be pleased to hear that the Bishop of\r\nOxford says it is the most unphilosophical (Another version of the words\r\nis given by Lyell, to whom they were spoken, viz. \"the most illogical\r\nbook ever written.\"--'Life,' volume ii. page 358.) work he ever read.\r\nThe review seems to me clever, and only misinterprets me in a few\r\nplaces. Like all hostile men, he passes over the explanation given of\r\nClassification, Morphology, Embryology, and Rudimentary Organs, etc. I\r\nread Wallace's paper in MS. (\"On the Zoological Geography of the Malay\r\nArchipelago.\"--Linn. Soc. Journ. 1860.), and thought it admirably\r\ngood; he does not know that he has been anticipated about the depth of\r\nintervening sea determining distribution... The most curious point in\r\nthe paper seems to me that about the African character of the Celebes\r\nproductions, but I should require further confirmation...\r\n\r\nHenslow is staying here; I have had some talk with him; he is in much\r\nthe same state as Bunbury (The late Sir Charles Bunbury, well-known as a\r\nPalaeo-botanist.), and will go a very little way with us, but brings up\r\nno real argument against going further. He also shudders at the eye!\r\nIt is really curious (and perhaps is an argument in our favour) how\r\ndifferently different opposers view the subject. Henslow used to rest\r\nhis opposition on the imperfection of the Geological Record, but he now\r\nthinks nothing of this, and says I have got well out of it; I wish I\r\ncould quite agree with him. Baden Powell says he never read anything so\r\nconclusive as my statement about the eye!! A stranger writes to me about\r\nsexual selection, and regrets that I boggle about such a trifle as the\r\nbrush of hair on the male turkey, and so on. As L. Jenyns has a really\r\nphilosophical mind, and as you say you like to see everything, I send an\r\nold letter of his. In a later letter to Henslow, which I have seen, he\r\nis more candid than any opposer I have heard of, for he says, though he\r\nCANNOT go so far as I do, yet he can give no good reason why he should\r\nnot. It is funny how each man draws his own imaginary line at which to\r\nhalt. It reminds me so vividly what I was told (By Professor Henslow.)\r\nabout you when I first commenced geology--to believe a LITTLE, but on no\r\naccount to believe all.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, February 18th [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI received about a week ago two sheets of your Review (The 'American\r\nJournal of Science and Arts,' March, 1860. Reprinted in 'Darwiniana,'\r\n1876.); read them, and sent them to Hooker; they are now returned and\r\nr-read with care, and to-morrow I send them to Lyell. Your Review seems\r\nto me ADMIRABLE; by far the best which I have read. I thank you from\r\nmy heart both for myself, but far more for the subject's sake. Your\r\ncontrast between the views of Agassiz and such as mine is very curious\r\nand instructive. (The contrast is briefly summed up thus: \"The theory\r\nof Agassiz regards the origin of species and their present general\r\ndistribution over the world as equally primordial, equally supernatural;\r\nthat of Darwin as equally derivative, equally natural.\"--'Darwiniana,'\r\npage 14.) By the way, if Agassiz writes anything on the subject, I hope\r\nyou will tell me. I am charmed with your metaphor of the streamlet never\r\nrunning against the force of gravitation. Your distinction between an\r\nhypothesis and theory seems to me very ingenious; but I do not think\r\nit is ever followed. Every one now speaks of the undulatory THEORY of\r\nlight; yet the ether is itself hypothetical, and the undulations are\r\ninferred only from explaining the phenomena of light. Even in the THEORY\r\nof gravitation is the attractive power in any way known, except by\r\nexplaining the fall of the apple, and the movements of the Planets?\r\nIt seems to me that an hypothesis is DEVELOPED into a theory solely by\r\nexplaining an ample lot of facts. Again and again I thank you for your\r\ngenerous aid in discussing a view, about which you very properly hold\r\nyourself unbiassed.\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray, yours most sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Several clergymen go far with me. Rev. L. Jenyns, a very good\r\nnaturalist. Henslow will go a very little way with me, and is not\r\nshocked with me. He has just been visiting me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[With regard to the attitude of the more liberal representatives of the\r\nChurch, the following letter (already referred to) from Charles Kingsley\r\nis of interest:]\r\n\r\n\r\nC. KINGSLEY TO CHARLES DARWIN. Eversley Rectory, Winchfield, November\r\n18th, 1859.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have to thank you for the unexpected honour of your book. That the\r\nNaturalist whom, of all naturalists living, I most wish to know and to\r\nlearn from, should have sent a scientist like me his book, encourages me\r\nat least to observe more carefully, and perhaps more slowly.\r\n\r\nI am so poorly (in brain), that I fear I cannot read your book just now\r\nas I ought. All I have seen of it AWES me; both with the heap of facts\r\nand the prestige of your name, and also with the clear intuition, that\r\nif you be right, I must give up much that I have believed and written.\r\n\r\nIn that I care little. Let God be true, and every man a liar! Let us\r\nknow what IS, and, as old Socrates has it, epesthai to logo--follow up\r\nthe villainous shifty fox of an argument, into whatsoever unexpected\r\nbogs and brakes he may lead us, if we do but run into him at last.\r\n\r\nFrom two common superstitions, at least, I shall be free while judging\r\nof your books:--\r\n\r\n1. I have long since, from watching the crossing of domesticated animals\r\nand plants, learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species.\r\n\r\n2. I have gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble a conception\r\nof Deity, to believe that he created primal forms capable of self\r\ndevelopment into all forms needful pro tempore and pro loco, as to\r\nbelieve that He required a fresh act of intervention to supply the\r\nlacunas which He Himself had made. I question whether the former be not\r\nthe loftier thought.\r\n\r\nBe it as it may, I shall prize your book, both for itself, and as a\r\nproof that you are aware of the existence of such a person as\r\n\r\nYour faithful servant, C. KINGSLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[My father's old friend, the Rev. J. Brodie Innes, of Milton Brodie, who\r\nwas for many years Vicar of Down, writes in the same spirit:\r\n\r\n\"We never attacked each other. Before I knew Mr. Darwin I had adopted,\r\nand publicly expressed, the principle that the study of natural history,\r\ngeology, and science in general, should be pursued without reference\r\nto the Bible. That the Book of Nature and Scripture came from the same\r\nDivine source, ran in parallel lines, and when properly understood would\r\nnever cross...\r\n\r\n\"His views on this subject were very much to the same effect from his\r\nside. Of course any conversations we may have had on purely religious\r\nsubjects are as sacredly private now as in his life; but the quaint\r\nconclusion of one may be given. We had been speaking of the apparent\r\ncontradiction of some supposed discoveries with the Book of Genesis; he\r\nsaid, 'you are (it would have been more correct to say you ought to be)\r\na theologian, I am a naturalist, the lines are separate. I endeavour to\r\ndiscover facts without considering what is said in the Book of Genesis.\r\nI do not attack Moses, and I think Moses can take care of himself.' To\r\nthe same effect he wrote more recently, 'I cannot remember that I ever\r\npublished a word directly against religion or the clergy; but if you\r\nwere to read a little pamphlet which I received a couple of days ago\r\nby a clergyman, you would laugh, and admit that I had some excuse\r\nfor bitterness. After abusing me for two or three pages, in language\r\nsufficiently plain and emphatic to have satisfied any reasonable man,\r\nhe sums up by saying that he has vainly searched the English language\r\nto find terms to express his contempt for me and all Darwinians.' In\r\nanother letter, after I had left Down, he writes, 'We often differed,\r\nbut you are one of those rare mortals from whom one can differ and yet\r\nfeel no shade of animosity, and that is a thing [of] which I should feel\r\nvery proud, if any one could say [it] of me.'\r\n\r\n\"On my last visit to Down, Mr. Darwin said, at his dinner-table, 'Brodie\r\nInnes and I have been fast friends for thirty years, and we never\r\nthoroughly agreed on any subject but once, and then we stared hard at\r\neach other, and thought one of us must be very ill.'\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, February 23rd [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nThat is a splendid answer of the father of Judge Crompton. How curious\r\nthat the Judge should have hit on exactly the same points as yourself.\r\nIt shows me what a capital lawyer you would have made, how many unjust\r\nacts you would have made appear just! But how much grander a field has\r\nscience been than the law, though the latter might have made you Lord\r\nKinnordy. I will, if there be another edition, enlarge on gradation in\r\nthe eye, and on all forms coming from one prototype, so as to try and\r\nmake both less glaringly improbable...\r\n\r\nWith respect to Bronn's objection that it cannot be shown how life\r\narises, and likewise to a certain extent Asa Gray's remark that\r\nnatural selection is not a vera causa, I was much interested by finding\r\naccidentally in Brewster's 'Life of Newton,' that Leibnitz objected to\r\nthe law of gravity because Newton could not show what gravity itself\r\nis. As it has chanced, I have used in letters this very same argument,\r\nlittle knowing that any one had really thus objected to the law of\r\ngravity. Newton answers by saying that it is philosophy to make out the\r\nmovements of a clock, though you do not know why the weight descends\r\nto the ground. Leibnitz further objected that the law of gravity was\r\nopposed to Natural Religion! Is this not curious? I really think I shall\r\nuse the facts for some introductory remarks for my bigger book.\r\n\r\n... You ask (I see) why we do not have monstrosities in higher animals;\r\nbut when they live they are almost always sterile (even giants and\r\ndwarfs are GENERALLY sterile), and we do not know that Harvey's monster\r\nwould have bred. There is I believe only one case on record of a peloric\r\nflower being fertile, and I cannot remember whether this reproduced\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nTo recur to the eye. I really think it would have been dishonest, not to\r\nhave faced the difficulty; and worse (as Talleyrand would have said), it\r\nwould have been impolitic I think, for it would have been thrown in my\r\nteeth, as H. Holland threw the bones of the ear, till Huxley shut him up\r\nby showing what a fine gradation occurred amongst living creatures.\r\n\r\nI thank you much for your most pleasant letter.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I send a letter by Herbert Spencer, which you can read or not\r\nas you think fit. He puts, to my mind, the philosophy of the argument\r\nbetter than almost any one, at the close of the letter. I could make\r\nnothing of Dana's idealistic notions about species; but then, as\r\nWollaston says, I have not a metaphysical head.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I have thrown at Wollaston's head, a paper by Alexander\r\nJordan, who demonstrates metaphysically that all our cultivated races\r\nare Go-created species.\r\n\r\nWollaston misrepresents accidentally, to a wonderful extent, some\r\npassages in my book. He reviewed, without relooking at certain passages.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, February 25th [1860].\r\n\r\n... I cannot help wondering at your zeal about my book. I declare to\r\nheaven you seem to care as much about my book as I do myself. You have\r\nno right to be so eminently unselfish! I have taken off my spit [i.e.\r\nfile] a letter of Ramsay's, as every geologist convert I think very\r\nimportant. By the way, I saw some time ago a letter from H.D. Rogers\r\n(Professor of Geology in the University of Glasgow. Born in the United\r\nStates 1809, died 1866.) to Huxley, in which he goes very far with us...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Saturday, March 3rd, [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nWhat a day's work you had on that Thursday! I was not able to go to\r\nLondon till Monday, and then I was a fool for going, for, on Tuesday\r\nnight, I had an attack of fever (with a touch of pleurisy), which came\r\non like a lion, but went off as a lamb, but has shattered me a good bit.\r\n\r\nI was much interested by your last note... I think you expect too much in\r\nregard to change of opinion on the subject of Species. One large class\r\nof men, more especially I suspect of naturalists, never will care about\r\nANY general question, of which old Gray, of the British Museum, may\r\nbe taken as a type; and secondly, nearly all men past a moderate age,\r\neither in actual years or in mind, are, I am fully convinced, incapable\r\nof looking at facts under a new point of view. Seriously, I am\r\nastonished and rejoiced at the progress which the subject has made; look\r\nat the enclosed memorandum. (See table of names below.) -- says my book\r\nwill be forgotten in ten years, perhaps so; but, with such a list, I\r\nfeel convinced the subject will not. The outsiders, as you say, are\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nYou say that you think that Bentham is touched, \"but, like a wise\r\nman, holds his tongue.\" Perhaps you only mean that he cannot decide,\r\notherwise I should think such silence the reverse of magnanimity; for\r\nif others behaved the same way, how would opinion ever progress? It is\r\na dereliction of actual duty. (In a subsequent letter to Sir J.D. Hooker\r\n(March 12th, 1860), my father wrote, \"I now quite understand Bentham's\r\nsilence.\")\r\n\r\nI am so glad to hear about Thwaites. (Dr. G.J.K. Thwaites, who was\r\nborn in 1811, established a reputation in this country as an expert\r\nmicroscopist, and an acute observer, working especially at cryptogamic\r\nbotany. On his appointment as Director of the Botanic Gardens at\r\nPeradenyia, Ceylon, Dr. Thwaites devoted himself to the flora of Ceylon.\r\nAs a result of this he has left numerous and valuable collections, a\r\ndescription of which he embodied in his 'Enumeratio Plantarum Zeylaniae'\r\n(1864). Dr. Thwaites was a fellow of the Linnean Society, but beyond the\r\nabove facts little seems to have been recorded of his life. His death\r\noccurred in Ceylon on September 11th, 1882, in his seventy-second year.\r\n\"Athenaeum\", October 14th, 1882, page 500.)... I have had an astounding\r\nletter from Dr. Boott (The letter is enthusiastically laudatory, and\r\nobviously full of genuine feeling.); it might be turned into ridicule\r\nagainst him and me, so I will not send it to any one. He writes in a\r\nnoble spirit of love of truth.\r\n\r\nI wonder what Lindley thinks; probably too busy to read or think on the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nI am vexed about Bentham's reticence, for it would have been of real\r\nvalue to know what parts appeared weakest to a man of his powers of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my dear Hooker, yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Is not Harvey in the class of men who do not at all care for\r\ngeneralities? I remember your saying you could not get him to write on\r\nDistribution. I have found his works very unfruitful in every respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Here follows the memorandum referred to:]\r\n\r\n  Geologists.    Zoologists and       Physiologists.

BENTHAM TO FRANCIS DARWIN. 25 Wilton Place, S.W., May 30th, 1882.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your note which I received last night, I send\r\nherewith the letters I have from your father. I should have done so on\r\nseeing the general request published in the papers, but that I did not\r\nthink there were any among them which could be of any use to you. Highly\r\nflattered as I was by the kind and friendly notice with which Mr. Darwin\r\noccasionally honoured me, I was never admitted into his intimacy, and he\r\ntherefore never made any communications to me in relation to his views\r\nand labours. I have been throughout one of his most sincere admirers,\r\nand fully adopted his theories and conclusions, notwithstanding the\r\nsevere pain and disappointment they at first occasioned me. On the day\r\nthat his celebrated paper was read at the Linnean Society, July 1st,\r\n1858, a long paper of mine had been set down for reading, in which,\r\nin commenting on the British Flora, I had collected a number of\r\nobservations and facts illustrating what I then believed to be a fixity\r\nin species, however difficult it might be to assign their limits,\r\nand showing a tendency of abnormal forms produced by cultivation\r\nor otherwise, to withdraw within those original limits when left to\r\nthemselves. Most fortunately my paper had to give way to Mr.\r\nDarwin's and when once that was read, I felt bound to defer mine for\r\nreconsideration; I began to entertain doubts on the subject, and on\r\nthe appearance of the 'Origin of Species,' I was forced, however\r\nreluctantly, to give up my long-cherished convictions, the results of\r\nmuch labour and study, and I cancelled all that part of my paper which\r\nurged original fixity, and published only portions of the remainder\r\nin another form, chiefly in the 'Natural History Review.' I have since\r\nacknowledged on various occasions my full adoption of Mr. Darwin's\r\nviews, and chiefly in my Presidential Address of 1863, and in my\r\nthirteenth and last address, issued in the form of a report to the\r\nBritish Association at its meeting at Belfast in 1874.\r\n\r\nI prize so highly the letters that I have of Mr. Darwin's, that I should\r\nfeel obliged by your returning them to me when you have done with them.\r\nUnfortunately I have not kept the envelopes, and Mr. Darwin usually only\r\ndated them by the month not by the year, so that they are not in any\r\nchronological order.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down [March] 12th [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nThinking over what we talked about, the high state of intellectual\r\ndevelopment of the old Grecians with the little or no subsequent\r\nimprovement, being an apparent difficulty, it has just occurred to me\r\nthat in fact the case harmonises perfectly with our views. The case\r\nwould be a decided difficulty on the Lamarckian or Vestigian doctrine\r\nof necessary progression, but on the view which I hold of progression\r\ndepending on the conditions, it is no objection at all, and harmonises\r\nwith the other facts of progression in the corporeal structure of other\r\nanimals. For in a state of anarchy, or despotism, or bad government,\r\nor after irruption of barbarians, force, strength, or ferocity, and not\r\nintellect, would be apt to gain the day.\r\n\r\nWe have so enjoyed your and Lady Lyell's visit.\r\n\r\nGood-night. C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--By an odd chance (for I had not alluded even to the subject)\r\nthe ladies attacked me this evening, and threw the high state of old\r\nGrecians into my teeth, as an unanswerable difficulty, but by good\r\nchance I had my answer all pat, and silenced them. Hence I have thought\r\nit worth scribbling to you...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J. PRESTWICH. (Now Professor of Geology in the\r\nUniversity of Oxford.) Down, March 12th [1860].\r\n\r\n... At some future time, when you have a little leisure, and when you\r\nhave read my 'Origin of Species,' I should esteem it a SINGULAR\r\nfavour if you would send me any general criticisms. I do not mean of\r\nunreasonable length, but such as you could include in a letter. I have\r\nalways admired your various memoirs so much that I should be eminently\r\nglad to receive your opinion, which might be of real service to me.\r\n\r\nPray do not suppose that I expect to CONVERT or PERVERT you; if I could\r\nstagger you in ever so slight a degree I should be satisfied; nor fear\r\nto annoy me by severe criticisms, for I have had some hearty kicks from\r\nsome of my best friends. If it would not be disagreeable to you to send\r\nme your opinion, I certainly should be truly obliged...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, April 3rd [1860].\r\n\r\n... I remember well the time when the thought of the eye made me cold\r\nall over, but I have got over this stage of the complaint, and now small\r\ntrifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The\r\nsight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me\r\nsick!...\r\n\r\nYou may like to hear about reviews on my book. Sedgwick (as I and\r\nLyell feel CERTAIN from internal evidence) has reviewed me savagely\r\nand unfairly in the \"Spectator\". (See the quotations which follow the\r\npresent letter.) The notice includes much abuse, and is hardly fair in\r\nseveral respects. He would actually lead any one, who was ignorant\r\nof geology, to suppose that I had invented the great gaps between\r\nsuccessive geological formations, instead of its being an almost\r\nuniversally admitted dogma. But my dear old friend Sedgwick, with his\r\nnoble heart, is old, and is rabid with indignation. It is hard to please\r\nevery one; you may remember that in my last letter I asked you to leave\r\nout about the Weald denudation: I told Jukes this (who is head man of\r\nthe Irish geological survey), and he blamed me much, for he believed\r\nevery word of it, and thought it not at all exaggerated! In fact,\r\ngeologists have no means of gauging the infinitude of past time. There\r\nhas been one prodigy of a review, namely, an OPPOSED one (by Pictet\r\n(Francois Jules Pictet, in the 'Archives des Sciences de la Bibliotheque\r\nUniverselle,' Mars 1860. The article is written in a courteous and\r\nconsiderate tone, and concludes by saying that the 'Origin' will be of\r\nreal value to naturalists, especially if they are not led away by\r\nits seductive arguments to believe in the dangerous doctrine of\r\nmodification. A passage which seems to have struck my father as being\r\nvaluable, and opposite which he has made double pencil marks and written\r\nthe word \"good,\" is worth quoting: \"La theorie de M. Darwin s'accorde\r\nmal avec l'histoire des types a formes bien tranchees et definies qui\r\nparaissent n'avoir vecu que pendant un temps limite. On en pourrait\r\nciter des centaines d'exemples, tel que les reptiles volants, les\r\nichthyosaures, les belemnites, les ammonites, etc.\" Pictet was born in\r\n1809, died 1872; he was Professor of Anatomy and Zoology at Geneva.),\r\nthe palaeontologist, in the Bib. Universelle of Geneva) which is\r\nPERFECTLY fair and just, and I agree to every word he says; our only\r\ndifference being that he attaches less weight to arguments in favour,\r\nand more to arguments opposed, than I do. Of all the opposed reviews,\r\nI think this the only quite fair one, and I never expected to see one.\r\nPlease observe that I do not class your review by any means as opposed,\r\nthough you think so yourself! It has done me MUCH too good service ever\r\nto appear in that rank in my eyes. But I fear I shall weary you with so\r\nmuch about my book. I should rather think there was a good chance of\r\nmy becoming the most egotistical man in all Europe! What a proud\r\npre-eminence! Well, you have helped to make me so and therefore you must\r\nforgive me if you can.\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray, ever yours most gratefully, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In a letter to Sir Charles Lyell reference is made to Sedgwick's review\r\nin the \"Spectator\", March 24:\r\n\r\n\"I now feel certain that Sedgwick is the author of the article in\r\nthe \"Spectator\". No one else could use such abusive terms. And what a\r\nmisrepresentation of my notions! Any ignoramus would suppose that I\r\nhad FIRST broached the doctrine, that the breaks between successive\r\nformations marked long intervals of time. It is very unfair. But\r\npoor dear old Sedgwick seems rabid on the question. \"Demoralised\r\nunderstanding!\" If ever I talk with him I will tell him that I never\r\ncould believe that an inquisitor could be a good man: but now I know\r\nthat a man may roast another, and yet have as kind and noble a heart as\r\nSedgwick's.\"\r\n\r\nThe following passages are taken from the review:\r\n\r\n\"I need hardly go on any further with these objections. But I cannot\r\nconclude without expressing my detestation of the theory, because of its\r\nunflinching materialism;--because it has deserted the inductive track,\r\nthe only track that leads to physical truth;--because it utterly\r\nrepudiates final causes, and thereby indicates a demoralised\r\nunderstanding on the part of its advocates.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that I believe that Darwin is an atheist; though I cannot but\r\nregard his materialism as atheistical. I think it untrue, because\r\nopposed to the obvious course of nature, and the very opposite of\r\ninductive truth. And I think it intensely mischievous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Each series of facts is laced together by a series of assumptions, and\r\nrepetitions of the one false principle. You cannot make a good rope out\r\nof a string of air bubbles.\"\r\n\r\n\"But any startling and (supposed) novel paradox, maintained very boldly\r\nand with something of imposing plausibility, produces in some minds a\r\nkind of pleasing excitement which predisposes them in its favour; and\r\nif they are unused to careful reflection, and averse to the labour of\r\naccurate investigation, they will be likely to conclude that what is\r\n(apparently) ORIGINAL, must be a production of original GENIUS, and\r\nthat anything very much opposed to prevailing notions must be a grand\r\nDISCOVERY,--in short, that whatever comes from the 'bottom of a well'\r\nmust be the 'truth' supposed to be hidden there.\"\r\n\r\nIn a review in the December number of 'Macmillan's Magazine,' 1860,\r\nFawcett vigorously defended my father from the charge of employing a\r\nfalse method of reasoning; a charge which occurs in Sedgwick's review,\r\nand was made at the time ad nauseam, in such phrases as: \"This is not\r\nthe true Baconian method.\" Fawcett repeated his defence at the meeting\r\nof the British Association in 1861. (See an interesting letter from my\r\nfather in Mr. Stephen's 'Life of Henry Fawcett,' 1886, page 101.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.B CARPENTER. Down, April 6th [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Carpenter,\r\n\r\nI have this minute finished your review in the 'Med. Chirurg. Review.'\r\n(April 1860.) You must let me express my admiration at this most able\r\nessay, and I hope to God it will be largely read, for it must produce a\r\ngreat effect. I ought not, however, to express such warm admiration, for\r\nyou give my book, I fear, far too much praise. But you have gratified me\r\nextremely; and though I hope I do not care very much for the approbation\r\nof the non-scientific readers, I cannot say that this is at all so with\r\nrespect to such few men as yourself. I have not a criticism to make, for\r\nI object to not a word; and I admire all, so that I cannot pick out\r\none part as better than the rest. It is all so well balanced. But it is\r\nimpossible not to be struck with your extent of knowledge in geology,\r\nbotany, and zoology. The extracts which you give from Hooker seem to me\r\nEXCELLENTLY chosen, and most forcible. I am so much pleased in what\r\nyou say also about Lyell. In fact I am in a fit of enthusiasm, and had\r\nbetter write no more. With cordial thanks,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, April 10th [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nThank you much for your note of the 4th; I am very glad to hear that you\r\nare at Torquay. I should have amused myself earlier by writing to you,\r\nbut I have had Hooker and Huxley staying here, and they have fully\r\noccupied my time, as a little of anything is a full dose for me... There\r\nhas been a plethora of reviews, and I am really quite sick of myself.\r\nThere is a very long review by Carpenter in the 'Medical and Chirurg.\r\nReview,' very good and well balanced, but not brilliant. He discusses\r\nHooker's books at as great length as mine, and makes excellent extracts;\r\nbut I could not get Hooker to feel the least interest in being praised.\r\n\r\nCarpenter speaks of you in thoroughly proper terms. There is a BRILLIANT\r\nreview by Huxley ('Westminster Review,' April 1860.), with capital hits,\r\nbut I do not know that he much advances the subject. I THINK I have\r\nconvinced him that he has hardly allowed weight enough to the case of\r\nvarieties of plants being in some degrees sterile.\r\n\r\nTo diverge from reviews: Asa Gray sends me from Wyman (who will write),\r\na good case of all the pigs being black in the Everglades of Virginia.\r\nOn asking about the cause, it seems (I have got capital analogous cases)\r\nthat when the BLACK pigs eat a certain nut their bones become red, and\r\nthey suffer to a certain extent, but that the WHITE pigs lose their\r\nhoofs and perish, \"and we aid by SELECTION, for we kill most of the\r\nyoung white pigs.\" This was said by men who could hardly read. By the\r\nway, it is a great blow to me that you cannot admit the potency of\r\nnatural selection. The more I think of it, the less I doubt its\r\npower for great and small changes. I have just read the 'Edinburgh'\r\n('Edinburgh Review,' April 1860.), which without doubt is by --. It is\r\nextremely malignant, clever, and I fear will be very damaging. He is\r\natrociously severe on Huxley's lecture, and very bitter against Hooker.\r\nSo we three ENJOYED it together. Not that I really enjoyed it, for\r\nit made me uncomfortable for one night; but I have got quite over it\r\nto-day. It requires much study to appreciate all the bitter spite of\r\nmany of the remarks against me; indeed I did not discover all myself.\r\nIt scandalously misrepresents many parts. He misquotes some passages,\r\naltering words within inverted commas...\r\n\r\nIt is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which -- hates me.\r\n\r\nNow for a curious thing about my book, and then I have done. In last\r\nSaturday's \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" (April 7th, 1860.), a Mr. Patrick\r\nMatthew publishes a long extract from his work on 'Naval Timber and\r\nArboriculture,' published in 1831, in which he briefly but completely\r\nanticipates the theory of Natural Selection. I have ordered the book,\r\nas some few passages are rather obscure, but it is certainly, I think, a\r\ncomplete but not developed anticipation! Erasmus always said that surely\r\nthis would be shown to be the case some day. Anyhow, one may be excused\r\nin not having discovered the fact in a work on Naval Timber.\r\n\r\nI heartily hope that your Torquay work may be successful. Give my\r\nkindest remembrances to Falconer, and I hope he is pretty well. Hooker\r\nand Huxley (with Mrs. Huxley) were extremely pleasant. But poor dear\r\nHooker is tired to death of my book, and it is a marvel and a prodigy if\r\nyou are not worse tired--if that be possible. Farewell, my dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [April 13th, 1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nQuestions of priority so often lead to odious quarrels, that I should\r\nesteem it a great favour if you would read the enclosed. ((My father\r\nwrote (\"Gardeners' Chronicle\", 1860, page 362, April 21st): \"I have been\r\nmuch interested by Mr. Patrick Matthew's communication in the number of\r\nyour paper dated April 7th. I freely acknowledge that Mr. Matthew has\r\nanticipated by many years the explanation which I have offered of the\r\norigin of species, under the name of natural selection. I think that\r\nno one will feel surprised that neither I, nor apparently any other\r\nnaturalist, had heard of Mr. Matthew's views, considering how briefly\r\nthey are given, and that they appeared in the appendix to a work on\r\nNaval Timber and Arboriculture. I can do no more than offer my apologies\r\nto Mr. Matthew for my entire ignorance of this publication. If any\r\nother edition of my work is called for, I will insert to the foregoing\r\neffect.\" In spite of my father's recognition of his claims, Mr. Matthew\r\nremained unsatisfied, and complained that an article in the 'Saturday\r\nAnalyst and Leader' was \"scarcely fair in alluding to Mr. Darwin as the\r\nparent of the origin of species, seeing that I published the whole\r\nthat Mr. Darwin attempts to prove, more than twenty-nine years\r\nago.\"--\"Saturday Analyst and Leader\", November 24, 1860.) If you think\r\nit proper that I should send it (and of this there can hardly be any\r\nquestion), and if you think it full and ample enough, please alter the\r\ndate to the day on which you post it, and let that be soon. The case in\r\nthe \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" seems a LITTLE stronger than in Mr. Matthew's\r\nbook, for the passages are therein scattered in three places; but it\r\nwould be mere hair-splitting to notice that. If you object to my letter,\r\nplease return it; but I do not expect that you will, but I thought that\r\nyou would not object to run your eye over it. My dear Hooker, it is a\r\ngreat thing for me to have so good, true, and old a friend as you. I owe\r\nmuch for science to my friends.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for Huxley's lecture. The latter part seemed to be grandly\r\neloquent.\r\n\r\n... I have gone over [the 'Edinburgh'] review again, and compared\r\npassages, and I am astonished at the misrepresentations. But I am glad\r\nI resolved not to answer. Perhaps it is selfish, but to answer and think\r\nmore on the subject is too unpleasant. I am so sorry that Huxley by my\r\nmeans has been thus atrociously attacked. I do not suppose you much care\r\nabout the gratuitous attack on you.\r\n\r\nLyell in his letter remarked that you seemed to him as if you were\r\noverworked. Do, pray, be cautious, and remember how many and many a man\r\nhas done this--who thought it absurd till too late. I have often thought\r\nthe same. You know that you were bad enough before your Indian journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, April [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI was very glad to get your nice long letter from Torquay. A press of\r\nletters prevented me writing to Wells. I was particularly glad to hear\r\nwhat you thought about not noticing [the 'Edinburgh'] review. Hooker and\r\nHuxley thought it a sort of duty to point out the alteration of quoted\r\ncitations, and there is truth in this remark; but I so hated the thought\r\nthat I resolved not to do so. I shall come up to London on Saturday the\r\n14th, for Sir B. Brodie's party, as I have an accumulation of things to\r\ndo in London, and will (if I do not hear to the contrary) call about a\r\nquarter before ten on Sunday morning, and sit with you at breakfast, but\r\nwill not sit long, and so take up much of your time. I must say one more\r\nword about our quasi-theological controversy about natural selection,\r\nand let me have your opinion when we meet in London. Do you consider\r\nthat the successive variations in the size of the crop of the Pouter\r\nPigeon, which man has accumulated to please his caprice, have been due\r\nto \"the creative and sustaining powers of Brahma?\" In the sense that\r\nan omnipotent and omniscient Deity must order and know everything, this\r\nmust be admitted; yet, in honest truth, I can hardly admit it. It seems\r\npreposterous that a maker of a universe should care about the crop of a\r\npigeon solely to please man's silly fancies. But if you agree with me in\r\nthinking such an interposition of the Deity uncalled for, I can see\r\nno reason whatever for believing in such interpositions in the case of\r\nnatural beings, in which strange and admirable peculiarities have been\r\nnaturally selected for the creature's own benefit. Imagine a Pouter in\r\na state of nature wading into the water and then, being buoyed up by\r\nits inflated crop, sailing about in search of food. What admiration this\r\nwould have excited--adaptation to the laws of hydrostatic pressure, etc.\r\netc. For the life of me I cannot see any difficulty in natural selection\r\nproducing the most exquisite structure, IF SUCH STRUCTURE CAN BE ARRIVED\r\nAT BY GRADATION, and I know from experience how hard it is to name any\r\nstructure towards which at least some gradations are not known.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--The conclusion at which I have come, as I have told Asa Gray, is\r\nthat such a question, as is touched on in this note, is beyond the human\r\nintellect, like \"predestination and free will,\" or the \"origin of evil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [April 18th, 1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI return --'s letter... Some of my relations say it cannot POSSIBLY be\r\n--'s article (The 'Edinburgh Review.'), because the reviewer speaks\r\nso very highly of --. Poor dear simple folk! My clever neighbour, Mr.\r\nNorman, says the article is so badly written, with no definite object,\r\nthat no one will read it. Asa Gray has sent me an article ('North\r\nAmerican Review,' April, 1860. \"By Professor Bowen,\" is written on my\r\nfather's copy. The passage referred to occurs at page 488, where\r\nthe author says that we ought to find \"an infinite number of other\r\nvarieties--gross, rude, and purposeless--the unmeaning creations of an\r\nunconscious cause.\") from the United States, clever, and dead against\r\nme. But one argument is funny. The reviewer says, that if the doctrine\r\nwere true, geological strata would be full of monsters which have\r\nfailed! A very clear view this writer had of the struggle for existence!\r\n\r\n... I am glad you like Adam Bede so much. I was charmed with it...\r\n\r\nWe think you must by mistake have taken with your own numbers of the\r\n'National Review' my precious number. (This no doubt refers to the\r\nJanuary number, containing Dr. Carpenter's review of the 'Origin.') I\r\nwish you would look.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, April 25th [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI have no doubt I have to thank you for the copy of a review on the\r\n'Origin' in the 'North American Review.' It seems to me clever, and I do\r\nnot doubt will damage my book. I had meant to have made some remarks\r\non it; but Lyell wished much to keep it, and my head is quite confused\r\nbetween the many reviews which I have lately read. I am sure the\r\nreviewer is wrong about bees' cells, i.e. about the distance; any lesser\r\ndistance would do, or even greater distance, but then some of the places\r\nwould lie outside the generative spheres; but this would not add much\r\ndifficulty to the work. The reviewer takes a strange view of instinct:\r\nhe seems to regard intelligence as a developed instinct; which I believe\r\nto be wholly false. I suspect he has never much attended to instinct and\r\nthe minds of animals, except perhaps by reading.\r\n\r\nMy chief object is to ask you if you could procure for me a copy of the\r\n\"New York Times\" for Wednesday, March 28th. It contains A VERY STRIKING\r\nreview of my book, which I should much like to keep. How curious that\r\nthe two most striking reviews (i.e. yours and this) should have appeared\r\nin America. This review is not really useful, but somehow is impressive.\r\nThere was a good review in the 'Revue des Deux Mondes,' April 1st, by M.\r\nLaugel, said to be a very clever man.\r\n\r\nHooker, about a fortnight ago, stayed here a few days, and was very\r\npleasant; but I think he overworks himself. What a gigantic undertaking,\r\nI imagine, his and Bentham's 'Genera Plantarum' will be! I hope he\r\nwill not get too much immersed in it, so as not to spare some time for\r\nGeographical Distribution and other such questions.\r\n\r\nI have begun to work steadily, but very slowly as usual, at details on\r\nvariation under domestication.\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray, Yours always truly and gratefully, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, [May 8th, 1860].\r\n\r\n... I have sent for the 'Canadian Naturalist.' If I cannot procure a copy\r\nI will borrow yours. I had a letter from Henslow this morning, who says\r\nthat Sedgwick was, on last Monday night, to open a battery on me at the\r\nCambridge Philosophical Society. Anyhow, I am much honoured by being\r\nattacked there, and at the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nI do not think it worth while to contradict single cases nor is it\r\nworth while arguing against those who do not attend to what I state. A\r\nmoment's reflection will show you that there must be (on our doctrine)\r\nlarge genera not varying (see page 56 on the subject, in the second\r\nedition of the 'Origin'). Though I do not there discuss the case in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nIt may be sheer bigotry for my own notions, but I prefer to the\r\nAtlantis, my notion of plants and animals having migrated from the Old\r\nto the New World, or conversely, when the climate was much hotter, by\r\napproximately the line of Behring's Straits. It is most important, as\r\nyou say, to see living forms of plants going back so far in time. I\r\nwonder whether we shall ever discover the flora of the dry land of the\r\ncoal period, and find it not so anomalous as the swamp or coal-making\r\nflora. I am working away over the blessed Pigeon Manuscript; but, from\r\none cause or another, I get on very slowly...\r\n\r\nThis morning I got a letter from the Academy of Natural Sciences of\r\nPhiladelphia, announcing that I am elected a correspondent... It shows\r\nthat some Naturalists there do not think me such a scientific profligate\r\nas many think me here.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell, yours gratefully, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--What a grand fact about the extinct stag's horn worked by man!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [May 13th, 1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI return Henslow, which I was very glad to see. How good of him to\r\ndefend me. (Against Sedgwick's attack before the Cambridge Philosophical\r\nSociety.) I will write and thank him.\r\n\r\nAs you said you were curious to hear Thomson's (Dr. Thomas Thomson the\r\nIndian Botanist. He was a collaborateur in Hooker and Thomson's Flora\r\nIndica. 1855.) opinion, I send his kind letter. He is evidently a strong\r\nopposer to us...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [May 15th, 1860].\r\n\r\n... How paltry it is in such men as X, Y and Co. not reading your essay.\r\nIt is incredibly paltry. (These remarks do not apply to Dr. Harvey, who\r\nwas, however, in a somewhat similar position. See below.) They may all\r\nattack me to their hearts' content. I am got case-hardened. As for the\r\nold fogies in Cambridge, it really signifies nothing. I look at their\r\nattacks as a proof that our work is worth the doing. It makes me resolve\r\nto buckle on my armour. I see plainly that it will be a long uphill\r\nfight. But think of Lyell's progress with Geology. One thing I see most\r\nplainly, that without Lyell's, yours, Huxley's and Carpenter's aid, my\r\nbook would have been a mere flash in the pan. But if we all stick to\r\nit, we shall surely gain the day. And I now see that the battle is worth\r\nfighting. I deeply hope that you think so. Does Bentham progress at all?\r\nI do not know what to say about Oxford. (His health prevented him from\r\ngoing to Oxford for the meeting of the British Association.) I should\r\nlike it much with you, but it must depend on health...\r\n\r\nYours must affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, May 18th [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI send a letter from Asa Gray to show how hotly the battle rages there.\r\nAlso one from Wallace, very just in his remarks, though too laudatory\r\nand too modest, and how admirably free from envy or jealousy. He must be\r\na good fellow. Perhaps I will enclose a letter from Thomson of Calcutta;\r\nnot that it is much, but Hooker thinks so highly of him...\r\n\r\nHenslow informs me that Sedgwick (Sedgwick's address is given somewhat\r\nabbreviated in \"The Cambridge Chronicle\", May 19th, 1860.) and then\r\nProfessor Clarke [sic] (The late William Clark, Professor of Anatomy,\r\nmy father seems to have misunderstood his informant. I am assured by Mr.\r\nJ.W. Clark that his father (Prof. Clark) did not support Sedgwick in the\r\nattack.) made a regular and savage onslaught on my book lately at the\r\nCambridge Philosophical Society, but Henslow seems to have defended\r\nme well, and maintained that the subject was a legitimate one for\r\ninvestigation. Since then Phillips (John Phillips, M.A., F.R.S., born\r\n1800, died 1874, from the effects of a fall. Professor of Geology at\r\nKing's College, London, and afterwards at Oxford. He gave the 'Rede'\r\nlecture at Cambridge on May 15th, 1860, on 'The Succession of Life\r\non the earth.' The Rede Lecturer is appointed annually by the\r\nVice-Chancellor, and is paid by an endowment left in 1524 by Sir\r\nRobert Rede, Lord Chief Justice, in the reign of Henry VIII.) has given\r\nlectures at Cambridge on the same subject, but treated it very fairly.\r\nHow splendidly Asa Gray is fighting the battle. The effect on me of\r\nthese multiplied attacks is simply to show me that the subject is worth\r\nfighting for, and assuredly I will do my best... I hope all the attacks\r\nmake you keep up your courage, and courage you assuredly will require...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, May 18th, 1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Wallace,\r\n\r\nI received this morning your letter from Amboyna, dated February 16th,\r\ncontaining some remarks and your too high approval of my book. Your\r\nletter has pleased me very much, and I most completely agree with you on\r\nthe parts which are strongest and which are weakest. The imperfection of\r\nthe Geological Record is, as you say, the weakest of all; but yet I am\r\npleased to find that there are almost more geological converts than of\r\npursuers of other branches of natural science... I think geologists are\r\nmore easily converted than simple naturalists, because more accustomed\r\nto reasoning. Before telling you about the progress of opinion on the\r\nsubject, you must let me say how I admire the generous manner in which\r\nyou speak of my book. Most persons would in your position have felt some\r\nenvy or jealousy. How nobly free you seem to be of this common failing\r\nof mankind. But you speak far too modestly of yourself. You would, if\r\nyou had my leisure, have done the work just as well, perhaps better,\r\nthan I have done it...\r\n\r\n... Agassiz sends me a personal civil message, but incessantly attacks\r\nme; but Asa Gray fights like a hero in defence. Lyell keeps as firm as a\r\ntower, and this Autumn will publish on the 'Geological History of Man,'\r\nand will then declare his conversion, which now is universally known. I\r\nhope that you have received Hooker's splendid essay... Yesterday I heard\r\nfrom Lyell that a German, Dr. Schaaffhausen (Hermann Schaaffhausen\r\n'Ueber Bestandigkeit und Umwandlung der Arten.' Verhandl. d. Naturhist.\r\nVereins, Bonn, 1853. See 'Origin,' Historical Sketch.), has sent him\r\na pamphlet published some years ago, in which the same view is nearly\r\nanticipated; but I have not yet seen this pamphlet. My brother, who is a\r\nvery sagacious man, always said, \"you will find that some one will have\r\nbeen before you.\" I am at work at my larger work, which I shall publish\r\nin a separate volume. But from ill-health and swarms of letters, I get\r\non very very slowly. I hope that I shall not have wearied you with these\r\ndetails. With sincere thanks for your letter, and with most deeply felt\r\nwishes for your success in science, and in every way, believe me,\r\n\r\nYour sincere well-wisher, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, May 22nd 1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nAgain I have to thank you for one of your very pleasant letters of May\r\n7th, enclosing a very pleasant remittance of 22 pounds. I am in simple\r\ntruth astonished at all the kind trouble you have taken for me. I\r\nreturn Appleton's account. For the chance of your wishing for a formal\r\nacknowledgment I send one. If you have any further communication to the\r\nAppletons, pray express my acknowledgment for [their] generosity; for\r\nit is generosity in my opinion. I am not at all surprised at the sale\r\ndiminishing; my extreme surprise is at the greatness of the sale. No\r\ndoubt the public has been SHAMEFULLY imposed on! for they bought the\r\nbook thinking that it would be nice easy reading. I expect the sale to\r\nstop soon in England, yet Lyell wrote to me the other day that calling\r\nat Murray's he heard that fifty copies had gone in the previous\r\nforty-eight hours. I am extremely glad that you will notice in\r\n'Silliman' the additions in the 'Origin.' Judging from letters (and I\r\nhave just seen one from Thwaites to Hooker), and from remarks, the most\r\nserious omission in my book was not explaining how it is, as I believe,\r\nthat all forms do not necessarily advance, how there can now be SIMPLE\r\norganisms still existing... I hear there is a VERY severe review on me\r\nin the 'North British,' by a Rev. Mr. Dunns (This statement as to\r\nauthorship was made on the authority of Robert Chambers.), a Free Kirk\r\nminister, and dabbler in Natural History. I should be very glad to see\r\nany good American reviews, as they are all more or less useful. You say\r\nthat you shall touch on other reviews. Huxley told me some time ago that\r\nafter a time he would write a review on all the reviews, whether he will\r\nI know not. If you allude to the 'Edinburgh,' pray notice SOME of the\r\npoints which I will point out on a separate slip. In the \"Saturday\r\nReview\" (one of our cleverest periodicals) of May 5th, page 573, there\r\nis a nice article on [the 'Edinburgh'] review, defending Huxley, but not\r\nHooker; and the latter, I think, [the 'Edinburgh' reviewer] treats most\r\nungenerously. (In a letter to Mr. Huxley my father wrote: \"Have you seen\r\nthe last \"Saturday Review\"? I am very glad of the defence of you and of\r\nmyself. I wish the reviewer had noticed Hooker. The reviewer, whoever he\r\nis, is a jolly good fellow, as this review and the last on me showed.\r\nHe writes capitally, and understands well his subject. I wish he had\r\nslapped [the 'Edinburgh' reviewer] a little bit harder.\") But surely you\r\nwill get sick unto death of me and my reviewers.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the theological view of the question. This is\r\nalways painful to me. I am bewildered. I had no intention to write\r\natheistically. But I own that I cannot see as plainly as others do, and\r\nas I should wish to do, evidence of design and beneficence on all sides\r\nof us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade\r\nmyself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly\r\ncreated the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding\r\nwithin the living bodies of Caterpillars, or that a cat should play with\r\nmice. Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye\r\nwas expressly designed. On the other hand, I cannot anyhow be contented\r\nto view this wonderful universe, and especially the nature of man, and\r\nto conclude that everything is the result of brute force. I am inclined\r\nto look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details,\r\nwhether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance.\r\nNot that this notion AT ALL satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the\r\nwhole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as\r\nwell speculate on the mind of Newton. Let each man hope and believe\r\nwhat he can. Certainly I agree with you that my views are not at all\r\nnecessarily atheistical. The lightning kills a man, whether a good one\r\nor bad one, owing to the excessively complex action of natural laws.\r\nA child (who may turn out an idiot) is born by the action of even more\r\ncomplex laws, and I can see no reason why a man, or other animal, may\r\nnot have been aboriginally produced by other laws, and that all these\r\nlaws may have been expressly designed by an omniscient Creator, who\r\nforesaw every future event and consequence. But the more I think the\r\nmore bewildered I become; as indeed I probably have shown by this\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nMost deeply do I feel your generous kindness and interest.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely and cordially, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n{Here follow my father's criticisms on the 'Edinburgh Review'}:\r\n\r\n\"What a quibble to pretend he did not understand what I meant by\r\nINHABITANTS of South America; and any one would suppose that I had not\r\nthroughout my volume touched on Geographical Distribution. He ignores\r\nalso everything which I have said on Classification, Geological\r\nSuccession, Homologies, Embryology, and Rudimentary Organs--page 496.\r\n\r\nHe falsely applies what I said (too rudely) about \"blindness of\r\npreconceived opinions\" to those who believe in creation, whereas I\r\nexclusively apply the remark to those who give up multitudes of species\r\nas true species, but believe in the remainder--page 500.\r\n\r\nHe slightly alters what I say,--I ASK whether creationists really\r\nbelieve that elemental atoms have flashed into life. He says that I\r\ndescribe them as so believing, and this, surely, is a difference--page\r\n501.\r\n\r\nHe speaks of my \"clamouring against\" all who believe in creation, and\r\nthis seems to me an unjust accusation--page 501.\r\n\r\nHe makes me say that the dorsal vertebrae vary; this is simply false: I\r\nnowhere say a word about dorsal vertebrae--page 522.\r\n\r\nWhat an illiberal sentence that is about my pretension to candour, and\r\nabout my rushing through barriers which stopped Cuvier: such an argument\r\nwould stop any progress in science--page 525.\r\n\r\nHow disingenuous to quote from my remark to you about my BRIEF letter\r\n[published in the 'Linn. Soc. Journal'], as if it applied to the whole\r\nsubject--page 530.\r\n\r\nHow disingenuous to say that we are called on to accept the theory, from\r\nthe imperfection of the geological record, when I over and over again\r\n[say] how grave a difficulty the imperfection offers--page 530.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 30th [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI return Harvey's letter, I have been very glad to see the reason why he\r\nhas not read your Essay. I feared it was bigotry, and I am glad to see\r\nthat he goes a little way (VERY MUCH further than I supposed) with us...\r\n\r\nI was not sorry for a natural opportunity of writing to Harvey, just to\r\nshow that I was not piqued at his turning me and my book into ridicule\r\n(A \"serio-comic squib,\" read before the 'Dublin University Zoological\r\nand Botanical Association,' February 17, 1860, and privately printed. My\r\nfather's presentation copy is inscribed \"With the writer's REPENTANCE,\r\nOctober 1860.\"), not that I think it was a proceeding which I deserved,\r\nor worthy of him. It delights me that you are interested in watching\r\nthe progress of opinion on the change of Species; I feared that you were\r\nweary of the subject; and therefore did not send A. Gray's letters. The\r\nbattle rages furiously in the United States. Gray says he was preparing\r\na speech, which would take 1 1/2 hours to deliver, and which he \"fondly\r\nhoped would be a stunner.\" He is fighting splendidly, and there seems\r\nto have been many discussions with Agassiz and others at the meetings.\r\nAgassiz pities me much at being so deluded. As for the progress of\r\nopinion, I clearly see that it will be excessively slow, almost as slow\r\nas the change of species... I am getting wearied at the storm of hostile\r\nreviews and hardly any useful...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, Friday night [June 1st, 1860].\r\n\r\n... Have you seen Hopkins (William Hopkins died in 1866, \"in his\r\nsevent-third year.\" He began life with a farm in Suffolk, but ultimately\r\nentered, comparatively late in life, at Peterhouse, Cambridge; he\r\ntook his degree in 1827, and afterward became an Esquire Bedell of the\r\nUniversity. He was chiefly known as a mathematical \"coach,\" and\r\nwas eminently successful in the manufacture of Senior Wranglers.\r\nNevertheless Mr. Stephen says ('Life of Fawcett,' page 26) that he\r\n\"was conspicuous for inculcating\" a \"liberal view of the studies of\r\nthe place. He endeavoured to stimulate a philosophical interest in\r\nthe mathematical sciences, instead of simply rousing an ardour for\r\ncompetition.\" He contributed many papers on geological and mathematical\r\nsubjects to the scientific journals. He had a strong influence for good\r\nover the younger men with whom he came in contact. The letter which\r\nhe wrote to Henry Fawcett on the occasion of his blindness illustrates\r\nthis. Mr. Stephen says ('Life of Fawcett,' page 48) that by \"this\r\ntimely word of good cheer,\" Fawcett was roused from \"his temporary\r\nprostration,\" and enabled to take a \"more cheerful and resolute tone.\")\r\nin the new 'Fraser'? the public will, I should think, find it heavy. He\r\nwill be dead against me, as you prophesied; but he is generally civil\r\nto me personally. ('Fraser's Magazine,' June 1860. My father, no doubt,\r\nrefers to the following passage, page 752, where the Reviewer Expresses\r\nhis \"full participation in the high respect in which the author is\r\nuniversally held, both as a man and a naturalist; and the more so,\r\nbecause in the remarks which will follow in the second part of this\r\nEssay we shall be found to differ widely from him as regards many of his\r\nconclusions and the reasonings on which he has founded them, and shall\r\nclaim the full right to express such differences of opinion with all\r\nthat freedom which the interests of scientific truth demands, and which\r\nwe are sure Mr. Darwin would be one of the last to refuse to any one\r\nprepared to exercise it with candour and courtesy.\" Speaking of this\r\nreview, my father wrote to Dr. Asa Gray: \"I have remonstrated with him\r\n[Hopkins] for so coolly saying that I base my views on what I reckon\r\nas great difficulties. Any one, by taking these difficulties alone, can\r\nmake a most strong case against me. I could myself write a more damning\r\nreview than has as yet appeared!\" A second notice by Hopkins appeared\r\nin the July number of 'Fraser's Magazine.') On his standard of proof,\r\nNATURAL science would never progress, for without the making of theories\r\nI am convinced there would be no observation.\r\n\r\n... I have begun reading the 'North British' (May 1860.), which so far\r\nstrikes me as clever.\r\n\r\nPhillips's Lecture at Cambridge is to be published.\r\n\r\nAll these reiterated attacks will tell heavily; there will be no\r\nmore converts, and probably some will go back. I hope you do not grow\r\ndisheartened, I am determined to fight to the last. I hear, however,\r\nthat the great Buckle highly approves of my book.\r\n\r\nI have had a note from poor Blyth (Edward Blyth, 1810-1873. His\r\nindomitable love of natural history made him neglect the druggist's\r\nbusiness with which he started in life, and he soon got into serious\r\ndifficulties. After supporting himself for a few years as a writer on\r\nField Natural History, he ultimately went out to India as Curator of the\r\nMuseum of the R. Asiatic Soc. of Bengal, where the greater part of his\r\nworking life was spent. His chief publications were the monthly reports\r\nmade as part of his duty to the Society. He had stored in his remarkable\r\nmemory a wonderful wealth of knowledge, especially with regard to the\r\nmammalia and birds of India--knowledge of which he freely gave to\r\nthose who asked. His letters to my father give evidence of having been\r\ncarefully studied, and the long list of entries after his name in the\r\nindex to 'Animals and Plants,' show how much help was received from him.\r\nHis life was an unprosperous and unhappy one, full of money difficulties\r\nand darkened by the death of his wife after a few years of marriage.),\r\nof Calcutta, who is much disappointed at hearing that Lord Canning will\r\nnot grant any money; so I much fear that all your great pains will be\r\nthrown away. Blyth says (and he is in many respects a very good judge)\r\nthat his ideas on species are quite revolutionised...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, June 5th [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to me to write to you, as I have no one to talk about\r\nsuch matters as we write on. But I seriously beg you not to write to\r\nme unless so inclined; for busy as you are, and seeing many people, the\r\ncase is very different between us...\r\n\r\nHave you seen --'s abusive article on me?... It out does even the 'North\r\nBritish' and 'Edinburgh' in misapprehension and misrepresentation.\r\nI never knew anything so unfair as in discussing cells of bees, his\r\nignoring the case of Melipona, which builds combs almost exactly\r\nintermediate between hive and humble bees. What has -- done that he\r\nfeels so immeasurably superior to all us wretched naturalists, and to\r\nall political economists, including that great philosopher Malthus? This\r\nreview, however, and Harvey's letter have convinced me that I must be\r\na very bad explainer. Neither really understand what I mean by Natural\r\nSelection. I am inclined to give up the attempt as hopeless. Those who\r\ndo not understand, it seems, cannot be made to understand.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I think, we entirely agree, except perhaps that I use too\r\nforcible language about selection. I entirely agree, indeed would almost\r\ngo further than you when you say that climate (i.e. variability from all\r\nunknown causes) is \"an active handmaid, influencing its mistress most\r\nmaterially.\" Indeed, I have never hinted that Natural Selection is \"the\r\nefficient cause to the exclusion of the other,\" i.e. variability from\r\nClimate, etc. The very term SELECTION implies something, i.e. variation\r\nor difference, to be selected...\r\n\r\nHow does your book progress (I mean your general sort of book on\r\nplants), I hope to God you will be more successful than I have been in\r\nmaking people understand your meaning. I should begin to think myself\r\nwholly in the wrong, and that I was an utter fool, but then I cannot yet\r\npersuade myself, that Lyell, and you and Huxley, Carpenter, Asa Gray,\r\nand Watson, etc., are all fools together. Well, time will show, and\r\nnothing but time. Farewell...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, June 6th [1860].\r\n\r\n... It consoles me that -- sneers at Malthus, for that clearly shows,\r\nmathematician though he may be, he cannot understand common reasoning.\r\nBy the way what a discouraging example Malthus is, to show during what\r\nlong years the plainest case may be misrepresented and misunderstood. I\r\nhave read the 'Future'; how curious it is that several of my reviewers\r\nshould advance such wild arguments, as that varieties of dogs and cats\r\ndo not mingle; and should bring up the old exploded doctrine of definite\r\nanalogies... I am beginning to despair of ever making the majority\r\nunderstand my notions. Even Hopkins does not thoroughly. By the way, I\r\nhave been so much pleased by the way he personally alludes to me. I must\r\nbe a very bad explainer. I hope to Heaven that you will succeed better.\r\nSeveral reviews and several letters have shown me too clearly how little\r\nI am understood. I suppose \"natural selection\" was a bad term; but to\r\nchange it now, I think, would make confusion worse confounded, nor can I\r\nthink of a better; \"Natural Preservation\" would not imply a preservation\r\nof particular varieties, and would seem a truism, and would not bring\r\nman's and nature's selection under one point of view. I can only hope\r\nby reiterated explanations finally to make the matter clearer. If my MS.\r\nspreads out, I think I shall publish one volume exclusively on variation\r\nof animals and plants under domestication. I want to show that I have\r\nnot been quite so rash as many suppose.\r\n\r\nThough weary of reviews, I should like to see Lowell's (The late J.A.\r\nLowell in the 'Christian Examiner' (Boston, U.S., May, 1860.) some\r\ntime... I suppose Lowell's difficulty about instinct is the same as\r\nBowen's; but it seems to me wholly to rest on the assumption that\r\ninstincts cannot graduate as finely as structures. I have stated in my\r\nvolume that it is hardly possible to know which, i.e. whether instinct\r\nor structure, change first by insensible steps. Probably sometimes\r\ninstinct, sometimes structure. When a British insect feeds on an exotic\r\nplant, instinct has changed by very small steps, and their structures\r\nmight change so as to fully profit by the new food. Or structure\r\nmight change first, as the direction of tusks in one variety of Indian\r\nelephants, which leads it to attack the tiger in a different manner from\r\nother kinds of elephants. Thanks for your letter of the 2nd, chiefly\r\nabout Murray. (N.B. Harvey of Dublin gives me, in a letter, the argument\r\nof tall men marrying short women, as one of great weight!)\r\n\r\nI do not quite understand what you mean by saying, \"that the more they\r\nprove that you underrate physical conditions, the better for you, as\r\nGeology comes in to your aid.\"\r\n\r\n... I see in Murray and many others one incessant fallacy, when alluding\r\nto slight differences of physical conditions as being very important;\r\nnamely, oblivion of the fact that all species, except very local ones,\r\nrange over a considerable area, and though exposed to what the world\r\ncalls considerable DIVERSITIES, yet keep constant. I have just alluded\r\nto this in the 'Origin' in comparing the productions of the Old and the\r\nNew Worlds. Farewell, shall you be at Oxford? If H. gets quite well,\r\nperhaps I shall go there.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down [June 14th, 1860].\r\n\r\n... Lowell's review (J.A. Lowell in the 'Christian Examiner,' May 1860.)\r\nis pleasantly written, but it is clear that he is not a naturalist. He\r\nquite overlooks the importance of the accumulation of mere individual\r\ndifferences, and which, I think I can show, is the great agency of\r\nchange under domestication. I have not finished Schaaffhausen, as I read\r\nGerman so badly. I have ordered a copy for myself, and should like to\r\nkeep yours till my own arrives, but will return it to you instantly if\r\nwanted. He admits statements rather rashly, as I dare say I do. I see\r\nonly one sentence as yet at all approaching natural selection.\r\n\r\nThere is a notice of me in the penultimate number of 'All the Year\r\nRound,' but not worth consulting; chiefly a well-done hash of my own\r\nwords. Your last note was very interesting and consolatory to me.\r\n\r\nI have expressly stated that I believe physical conditions have a more\r\ndirect effect on plants than on animals. But the more I study, the\r\nmore I am led to think that natural selection regulates, in a state\r\nof nature, most trifling differences. As squared stone, or bricks, or\r\ntimber, are the indispensable materials for a building, and influence\r\nits character, so is variability not only indispensable, but\r\ninfluential. Yet in the same manner as the architect is the ALL\r\nimportant person in a building, so is selection with organic bodies...\r\n\r\n\r\n[The meeting of the British Association at Oxford in 1860 is famous\r\nfor two pitched battles over the 'Origin of Species.' Both of them\r\noriginated in unimportant papers. On Thursday, June 28, Dr. Daubeny of\r\nOxford made a communication to Section D: \"On the final causes of the\r\nsexuality of plants, with particular reference to Mr. Darwin's work on\r\nthe 'Origin of Species.'\" Mr. Huxley was called on by the President, but\r\ntried (according to the \"Athenaeum\" report) to avoid a discussion, on\r\nthe ground \"that a general audience, in which sentiment would unduly\r\ninterfere with intellect, was not the public before which such a\r\ndiscussion should be carried on.\" However, the subject was not allowed\r\nto drop. Sir R. Owen (I quote from the \"Athenaeum\", July 7, 1860), who\r\n\"wished to approach this subject in the spirit of the philosopher,\"\r\nexpressed his \"conviction that there were facts by which the public\r\ncould come to some conclusion with regard to the probabilities of the\r\ntruth of Mr. Darwin's theory.\" He went on to say that the brain of the\r\ngorilla \"presented more differences, as compared with the brain of man,\r\nthan it did when compared with the brains of the very lowest and most\r\nproblematical of the Quadrumana.\" Mr. Huxley replied, and gave these\r\nassertions a \"direct and unqualified contradiction,\" pledging himself to\r\n\"justify that unusual procedure elsewhere\" ('Man's Place in Nature,' by\r\nT.H. Huxley, 1863, page 114.), a pledge which he amply fulfilled.\r\n(See the 'Nat. Hist. Review,' 1861.) On Friday there was peace, but on\r\nSaturday 30th, the battle arose with redoubled fury over a paper by\r\nDr. Draper of New York, on the 'Intellectual development of Europe\r\nconsidered with reference to the views of Mr. Darwin.'\r\n\r\nThe following account is from an eye-witness of the scene.\r\n\r\n\"The excitement was tremendous. The Lecture-room, in which it had been\r\narranged that the discussion should be held, proved far too small for\r\nthe audience, and the meeting adjourned to the Library of the Museum,\r\nwhich was crammed to suffocation long before the champions entered\r\nthe lists. The numbers were estimated at from 700 to 1000. Had it been\r\nterm-time, or had the general public been admitted, it would have been\r\nimpossible to have accommodated the rush to hear the oratory of the\r\nbold Bishop. Professor Henslow, the President of Section D, occupied\r\nthe chair and wisely announced in limine that none who had not valid\r\narguments to bring forward on one side or the other, would be allowed to\r\naddress the meeting: a caution that proved necessary, for no fewer than\r\nfour combatants had their utterances burked by him, because of their\r\nindulgence in vague declamation.\r\n\r\n\"The Bishop was up to time, and spoke for full half-an-hour with\r\ninimitable spirit, emptiness and unfairness. It was evident from his\r\nhandling of the subject that he had been 'crammed' up to the throat, and\r\nthat he knew nothing at first hand; in fact, he used no argument not\r\nto be found in his 'Quarterly' article. He ridiculed Darwin badly, and\r\nHuxley savagely, but all in such dulcet tones, so persuasive a manner,\r\nand in such well-turned periods, that I who had been inclined to blame\r\nthe President for allowing a discussion that could serve no scientific\r\npurpose now forgave him from the bottom of my heart. Unfortunately the\r\nBishop, hurried along on the current of his own eloquence, so far forgot\r\nhimself as to push his attempted advantage to the verge of personality\r\nin a telling passage in which he turned round and addressed Huxley:\r\nI forgot the precise words, and quote from Lyell. 'The Bishop asked\r\nwhether Huxley was related by his grandfather's or grandmother's side to\r\nan ape.' (Lyell's 'Letters,' vol. ii. page 335.) Huxley replied to the\r\nscientific argument of his opponent with force and eloquence, and to\r\nthe personal allusion with a sel-restraint, that gave dignity to his\r\ncrushing rejoinder.\"\r\n\r\nMany versions of Mr. Huxley's speech were current: the following report\r\nof his conclusion is from a letter addressed by the late John Richard\r\nGreen, then an undergraduate, to a fellow-student, now Professor Boyd\r\nDawkins. \"I asserted, and I repeat, that a man has no reason to be\r\nashamed of having an ape for his grandfather. If there were an ancestor\r\nwhom I should feel shame in recalling, it would be a MAN, a man of\r\nrestless and versatile intellect, who, not content with an equivocal\r\n(Prof. V. Carus, who has a distinct recollection of the scene, does not\r\nremember the word equivocal. He believes too that Lyell's version of\r\nthe \"ape\" sentence is slightly incorrect.) success in his own sphere of\r\nactivity, plunges into scientific questions with which he has no real\r\nacquaintance, only to obscure them by an aimless rhetoric, and distract\r\nthe attention of his hearers from the real point at issue by eloquent\r\ndigressions, and skilled appeals to religious prejudice.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter above quoted continues:\r\n\r\n\"The excitement was now at its height; a lady fainted and had to be\r\ncarried out, and it was some time before the discussion was resumed.\r\nSome voices called for Hooker, and his name having been handed up, the\r\nPresident invited him to give his view of the theory from the Botanical\r\nside. This he did, demonstrating that the Bishop, by his own showing,\r\nhad never grasped the principles of the 'Origin' (With regard to the\r\nBishop's 'Quarterly Review,' my father wrote: \"These very clever men\r\nthink they can write a review with a very slight knowledge of the book\r\nreviewed or subject in question.\"), and that he was absolutely ignorant\r\nof the elements of botanical science. The Bishop made no reply, and the\r\nmeeting broke up.\r\n\r\n\"There was a crowded conversazione in the evening at the rooms of the\r\nhospitable and genial Professor of Botany, Dr. Daubeny, where the almost\r\nsole topic was the battle of the 'Origin,' and I was much struck with\r\nthe fair and unprejudiced way in which the black coats and white cravats\r\nof Oxford discussed the question, and the frankness with which they\r\noffered their congratulations to the winners in the combat.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Sudbrook Park, Monday night [July 2nd,\r\n1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have just received your letter. I have been very poorly, with almost\r\ncontinuous bad headache for forty-eight hours, and I was low enough,\r\nand thinking what a useless burthen I was to myself and all others, when\r\nyour letter came, and it has so cheered me; your kindness and affection\r\nbrought tears into my eyes. Talk of fame, honour, pleasure, wealth, all\r\nare dirt compared with affection; and this is a doctrine with which, I\r\nknow, from your letter, that you will agree with from the bottom of your\r\nheart... How I should have liked to have wandered about Oxford with you,\r\nif I had been well enough; and how still more I should have liked to\r\nhave heard you triumphing over the Bishop. I am astonished at your\r\nsuccess and audacity. It is something unintelligible to me how any one\r\ncan argue in public like orators do. I had no idea you had this power.\r\nI have read lately so many hostile views, that I was beginning to think\r\nthat perhaps I was wholly in the wrong, and that -- was right when he\r\nsaid the whole subject would be forgotten in ten years; but now that I\r\nhear that you and Huxley will fight publicly (which I am sure I never\r\ncould do), I fully believe that our cause will, in the long-run,\r\nprevail. I am glad I was not in Oxford, for I should have been\r\noverwhelmed, with my [health] in its present state.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Sudbrook Park, Richmond, July 3rd [1860].\r\n\r\n... I had a letter from Oxford, written by Hooker late on Sunday night,\r\ngiving me some account of the awful battles which have raged about\r\nspecies at Oxford. He tells me you fought nobly with Owen (but I have\r\nheard no particulars), and that you answered the B. of O. capitally. I\r\noften think that my friends (and you far beyond others) have good cause\r\nto hate me, for having stirred up so much mud, and led them into so much\r\nodious trouble. If I had been a friend of myself, I should have hated\r\nme. (How to make that sentence good English, I know not.) But remember,\r\nif I had not stirred up the mud, some one else certainly soon would.\r\nI honour your pluck; I would as soon have died as tried to answer the\r\nBishop in such an assembly...\r\n\r\n\r\n[On July 20th, my father wrote to Mr. Huxley:\r\n\r\n\"From all that I hear from several quarters, it seems that Oxford did\r\nthe subject great good. It is of enormous importance, the showing the\r\nworld that a few first-rate men are not afraid of expressing their\r\nopinion.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [July 1860].\r\n\r\n... I have just read the 'Quarterly.' ('Quarterly Review,' July 1860.\r\nThe article in question was by Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, and\r\nwas afterwards published in his \"Essays Contributed to the 'Quarterly\r\nReview,' 1874.\" The passage from the 'Anti-Jacobin' gives the history of\r\nthe evolution of space from the \"primaeval point or punctum saliens of\r\nthe universe,\" which is conceived to have moved \"forward in a right line\r\nad infinitum, till it grew tired; after which the right line, which\r\nit had generated, would begin to put itself in motion in a lateral\r\ndirection, describing an area of infinite extent. This area, as soon\r\nas it became conscious of its own existence, would begin to ascend or\r\ndescend according as its specific gravity would determine it, forming\r\nan immense solid space filled with vacuum, and capable of containing the\r\npresent universe.\"\r\n\r\nThe following (page 263) may serve as an example of the passages in\r\nwhich the reviewer refers to Sir Charles Lyell:--\"That Mr. Darwin should\r\nhave wandered from this broad highway of nature's works into the jungle\r\nof fanciful assumption is no small evil. We trust that he is mistaken\r\nin believing that he may count Sir C. Lyell as one of his converts. We\r\nknow, indeed, that the strength of the temptations which he can bring to\r\nbear upon his geological brother... Yet no man has been more distinct and\r\nmore logical in the denial of the transmutation of species than Sir C.\r\nLyell, and that not in the infancy of his scientific life, but in its\r\nfull vigour and maturity.\" The Bishop goes on to appeal to Lyell, in\r\norder that with his help \"this flimsy speculation may be as completely\r\nput down as was what in spite of all denials we must venture to call its\r\ntwin though less instructed brother, the 'Vestiges of Creation.'\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to this article, Mr. Brodie Innes, my father's old friend\r\nand neighbour, writes:--\"Most men would have been annoyed by an article\r\nwritten with the Bishop's accustomed vigour, a mixture of argument\r\nand ridicule. Mr. Darwin was writing on some parish matter, and put a\r\npostscript--'If you have not seen the last 'Quarterly,' do get it; the\r\nBishop of Oxford has made such capital fun of me and my grandfather.' By\r\na curious coincidence, when I received the letter, I was staying in the\r\nsame house with the Bishop, and showed it to him. He said, 'I am very\r\nglad he takes it in that way, he is such a capital fellow.'\") It is\r\nuncommonly clever; it picks out with skill all the most conjectural\r\nparts, and brings forward well all the difficulties. It quizzes me quite\r\nsplendidly by quoting the 'Anti-Jacobin' versus my Grandfather. You are\r\nnot alluded to, nor, strange to say, Huxley; and I can plainly see, here\r\nand there, --'s hand. The concluding pages will make Lyell shake in his\r\nshoes. By Jove, if he sticks to us, he will be a real hero. Good-night.\r\nYour wel-quizzed, but not sorrowful, and affectionate friend.\r\n\r\nC.D.\r\n\r\nI can see there has been some queer tampering with the Review, for a\r\npage has been cut out and reprinted.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Writing on July 22 to Dr. Asa Gray my father thus refers to Lyell's\r\nposition:--\r\n\r\n\"Considering his age, his former views and position in society, I think\r\nhis conduct has been heroic on this subject.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. [Hartfield, Sussex] July 22nd [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nOwing to absence from home at water-cure and then having to move my sick\r\ngirl to whence I am now writing, I have only lately read the discussion\r\nin Proc. American Acad. (April 10, 1860. Dr. Gray criticised in detail\r\n\"several of the positions taken at the preceding meeting by Mr.\r\n[J.A.] Lowell, Prof. Bowen and Prof. Agassiz.\" It was reprinted in the\r\n\"Athenaeum\", August 4, 1860.), and now I cannot resist expressing my\r\nsincere admiration of your most clear powers of reasoning. As Hooker\r\nlately said in a note to me, you are more than ANY ONE else the thorough\r\nmaster of the subject. I declare that you know my book as well as I do\r\nmyself; and bring to the question new lines of illustration and argument\r\nin a manner which excites my astonishment and almost my envy! I admire\r\nthese discussions, I think, almost more than your article in Silliman's\r\nJournal. Every single word seems weighed carefully, and tells like a\r\n32-pound shot. It makes me much wish (but I know that you have not time)\r\nthat you could write more in detail, and give, for instance, the facts\r\non the variability of the American wild fruits. The \"Athenaeum\" has\r\nthe largest circulation, and I have sent my copy to the editor with a\r\nrequest that he would republish the first discussion; I much fear he\r\nwill not, as he reviewed the subject in so hostile a spirit... I shall\r\nbe curious [to see] and will order the August number, as soon as I know\r\nthat it contains your review of Reviews. My conclusion is that you have\r\nmade a mistake in being a botanist, you ought to have been a lawyer.\r\n\r\n... Henslow (Professor Henslow was mentioned in the December number of\r\n'Macmillan's Magazine' as being an adherent of Evolution. In consequence\r\nof this he published, in the February number of the following year, a\r\nletter defining his position. This he did by means of an extract from a\r\nletter addressed to him by the Rev. L. Jenyns (Blomefield) which \"very\r\nnearly,\" as he says, expressed his views. Mr. Blomefield wrote, \"I was\r\nnot aware that you had become a convert to his (Darwin's) theory, and\r\ncan hardly suppose you have accepted it as a whole, though, like myself,\r\nyou may go to the length of imagining that many of the smaller groups,\r\nboth of animals and plants, may at some remote period have had a common\r\nparentage. I do not with some say that the whole of his theory cannot\r\nbe true--but that it is very far from proved; and I doubt its ever being\r\npossible to prove it.\") and Daubeny are shaken. I hear from Hooker that\r\nhe hears from Hochstetter that my views are making very considerable\r\nprogress in Germany, and the good workers are discussing the question.\r\nBronn at the end of his translation has a chapter of criticism, but it\r\nis such difficult German that I have not yet read it. Hopkins's review\r\nin 'Fraser' is thought the best which has appeared against us. I believe\r\nthat Hopkins is so much opposed because his course of study has never\r\nled him to reflect much on such subjects as geographical distribution,\r\nclassification, homologies, etc., so that he does not feel it a relief\r\nto have some kind of explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Hartfield [Sussex], July 30th [1860].\r\n\r\n... I had lots of pleasant letters about the British Association, and our\r\nside seems to have got on very well. There has been as much discussion\r\non the other side of the Atlantic as on this. No one I think understands\r\nthe whole case better than Asa Gray, and he has been fighting nobly. He\r\nis a capital reasoner. I have sent one of his printed discussions to our\r\n\"Athenaeum\", and the editor says he will print it. The 'Quarterly' has\r\nbeen out some time. It contains no malice, which is wonderful... It makes\r\nme say many things which I do not say. At the end it quotes all your\r\nconclusions against Lamarck, and makes a solemn appeal to you to keep\r\nfirm in the true faith. I fancy it will make you quake a little. -- has\r\ningeniously primed the Bishop (with Murchison) against you as head of\r\nthe uniformitarians. The only other review worth mentioning, which I can\r\nthink of, is in the third No. of the 'London Review,' by some geologist,\r\nand favorable for a wonder. It is very ably done, and I should like\r\nmuch to know who is the author. I shall be very curious to hear on your\r\nreturn whether Bronn's German translation of the 'Origin' has drawn\r\nany attention to the subject. Huxley is eager about a 'Natural History\r\nReview,' which he and others are going to edit, and he has got so\r\nmany first-rate assistants, that I really believe he will make it\r\na first-rate production. I have been doing nothing, except a little\r\nbotanical work as amusement. I shall hereafter be very anxious to hear\r\nhow your tour has answered. I expect your book on the geological history\r\nof Man will, with a vengeance, be a bomb-shell. I hope it will not be\r\nvery long delayed. Our kindest remembrances to Lady Lyell. This is not\r\nworth sending, but I have nothing better to say.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO F. WATKINS. (See Volume I.) Down, July 30th, [1860?].\r\n\r\nMy dear Watkins,\r\n\r\nYour note gave me real pleasure. Leading the retired life which I do,\r\nwith bad health, I oftener think of old times than most men probably do;\r\nand your face now rises before me, with the pleasant old expression, as\r\nvividly as if I saw you.\r\n\r\nMy book has been well abused, praised, and splendidly quizzed by the\r\nBishop of Oxford; but from what I see of its influence on really good\r\nworkers in science, I feel confident that, IN THE MAIN, I am on the\r\nright road. With respect to your question, I think the arguments\r\nare valid, showing that all animals have descended from four or five\r\nprimordial forms; and that analogy and weak reasons go to show that all\r\nhave descended from some single prototype.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my old friend. I look back to old Cambridge days with\r\nunalloyed pleasure.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours most sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.H. HUXLEY TO CHARLES DARWIN. August 6th, 1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI have to announce a new and great ally for you...\r\n\r\nVon Baer writes to me thus:--Et outre cela, je trouve que vous ecrivez\r\nencore des redactions. Vous avez ecrit sur l'ouvrage de M. Darwin une\r\ncritique dont je n'ai trouve que des debris dans un journal allemand.\r\nJ'ai oublie le nom terrible du journal anglais dans lequel se trouve\r\nvotre recension. En tout cas aussi je ne peux pas trouver le journal\r\nici. Comme je m'interesse beaucoup pour les idees de M. Darwin, sur\r\nlesquelles j'ai parle publiquement et sur lesquelles je ferai peut-etre\r\nimprimer quelque chose--vous m'obligeriez infiniment si vous pourriez me\r\nfaire parvenir ce que vous avez ecrit sur ces idees.\r\n\r\n\"J'ai enonce les memes idees sur la transformation des types ou origine\r\nd'especes que M. Darwin. (See Vol. I.) Mais c'est seulement sur la\r\ngeographie zoologique que je m'appuie. Vous trouverez, dans le dernier\r\nchapitre du traite 'Ueber Papuas und Alfuren,' que j'en parle tres\r\ndecidement sans savoir que M. Darwin s'occupait de cet objet.\"\r\n\r\nThe treatise to which Von Baer refers he gave me when over here, but I\r\nhave not been able to lay hands on it since this letter reached me two\r\ndays ago. When I find it I will let you know what there is in it.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully, T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, August 8 [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nYour note contained magnificent news, and thank you heartily for sending\r\nit me. Von Baer weighs down with a vengeance all the virulence of [the\r\n'Edinburgh' reviewer] and weak arguments of Agassiz. If you write to\r\nVon Baer, for heaven's sake tell him that we should think one nod of\r\napprobation on our side, of the greatest value; and if he does write\r\nanything, beg him to send us a copy, for I would try and get it\r\ntranslated and published in the \"Athenaeum\" and in 'Silliman' to touch\r\nup Agassiz... Have you seen Agassiz's weak metaphysical and theological\r\nattack on the 'Origin' in the last 'Silliman'? (The 'American Journal\r\nof Science and Arts' (commonly called 'Silliman's Journal'), July 1860.\r\nPrinted from advanced sheets of vol. iii. of 'Contributions to the Nat.\r\nHist. of the U.S.' My father's copy has a pencilled \"Truly\" opposite the\r\nfollowing passage:--\"Unless Darwin and his followers succeed in showing\r\nthat the struggle for life tends to something beyond favouring the\r\nexistence of certain individuals over that of other individuals, they\r\nwill soon find that they are following a shadow.\") I would send it you,\r\nbut apprehend it would be less trouble for you to look at it in London\r\nthan return it to me. R. Wagner has sent me a German pamphlet ('Louis\r\nAgassiz's Prinzipien der Classification, etc., mit Rucksicht auf Darwins\r\nAnsichten. Separat-Abdruck aus den Gottingischen gelehrten Anzeigen,'\r\n1860.), giving an abstract of Agassiz's 'Essay on Classification,' \"mit\r\nRucksicht auf Darwins Ansichten,\" etc. etc. He won't go very \"dangerous\r\nlengths,\" but thinks the truth lies half-way between Agassiz and\r\nthe 'Origin.' As he goes thus far he will, nolens volens, have to go\r\nfurther. He says he is going to review me in [his] yearly Report. My\r\ngood and kind agent for the propagation of the Gospel--i.e. the devil's\r\ngospel.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, August 11th [1860].\r\n\r\n... I have laughed at Woodward thinking that you were a man who could be\r\ninfluenced in your judgment by the voice of the public; and yet after\r\nmortally sneering at him, I was obliged to confess to myself, that I had\r\nhad fears, what the effect might be of so many heavy guns fired by great\r\nmen. As I have (sent by Murray) a spare 'Quarterly Review,' I send it by\r\nthis post, as it may amuse you. The Anti-Jacobin part amused me. It is\r\nfull of errors, and Hooker is thinking of answering it. There has been\r\na cancelled page; I should like to know what gigantic blunder it\r\ncontained. Hooker says that -- has played on the Bishop, and made him\r\nstrike whatever note he liked; he has wished to make the article as\r\ndisagreeable to you as possible. I will send the \"Athenaeum\" in a day or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nAs you wish to hear what reviews have appeared, I may mention that\r\nAgassiz has fired off a shot in the last 'Silliman,' not good at all,\r\ndenies variations and rests on the perfection of Geological evidence.\r\nAsa Gray tells me that a very clever friend has been almost converted\r\nto our side by this review of Agassiz's... Professor Parsons (Theophilus\r\nParsons, Professor of Law in Harvard University.) has published in\r\nthe same 'Silliman' a speculative paper correcting my notions, worth\r\nnothing. In the 'Highland Agricultural Journal' there is a review by\r\nsome Entomologist, not worth much. This is all that I can remember... As\r\nHuxley says, the platoon firing must soon cease. Hooker and Huxley, and\r\nAsa Gray, I see, are determined to stick to the battle and not give in;\r\nI am fully convinced that whenever you publish, it will produce a great\r\neffect on all TRIMMERS, and on many others. By the way I forgot\r\nto mention Daubeny's pamphlet ('Remarks on the final causes of the\r\nsexuality of plants with particular reference to Mr. Darwin's work on\r\nthe \"Origin of Species.\"'--British Association Report, 1860.), very\r\nliberal and candid, but scientifically weak. I believe Hooker is going\r\nnowhere this summer; he is excessively busy... He has written me many,\r\nmost nice letters. I shall be very curious to hear on your return some\r\naccount of your Geological doings. Talking of Geology, you used to\r\nbe interested about the \"pipes\" in the chalk. About three years ago\r\na perfectly circular hole suddenly appeared in a flat grass field to\r\neveryone's astonishment, and was filled up with many waggon loads of\r\nearth; and now two or three days ago, again it has circularly subsided\r\nabout two feet more. How clearly this shows what is still slowly going\r\non. This morning I recommenced work, and am at dogs; when I have written\r\nmy short discussion on them, I will have it copied, and if you like, you\r\ncan then see how the argument stands, about their multiple origin. As\r\nyou seemed to think this important, it might be worth your reading;\r\nthough I do not feel sure that you will come to the same probable\r\nconclusion that I have done. By the way, the Bishop makes a very telling\r\ncase against me, by accumulating several instances where I speak very\r\ndoubtfully; but this is very unfair, as in such cases as this of the\r\ndog, the evidence is and must be very doubtful...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, August 11 [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nOn my return home from Sussex about a week ago, I found several articles\r\nsent by you. The first article, from the 'Atlantic Monthly,' I am very\r\nglad to possess. By the way, the editor of the \"Athenaeum\" (August 4,\r\n1860.) has inserted your answer to Agassiz, Bowen, and Co., and when I\r\ntherein read them, I admired them even more than at first. They really\r\nseemed to be admirable in their condensation, force, clearness and\r\nnovelty.\r\n\r\nI am surprised that Agassiz did not succeed in writing something better.\r\nHow absurd that logical quibble--\"if species do not exist, how can they\r\nvary?\" As if any one doubted their temporary existence. How coolly\r\nhe assumes that there is some clearly defined distinction between\r\nindividual differences and varieties. It is no wonder that a man who\r\ncalls identical forms, when found in two countries, distinct species,\r\ncannot find variation in nature. Again, how unreasonable to suppose that\r\ndomestic varieties selected by man for his own fancy should resemble\r\nnatural varieties or species. The whole article seems to me poor; it\r\nseems to me hardly worth a detailed answer (even if I could do it, and\r\nI much doubt whether I possess your skill in picking out salient points\r\nand driving a nail into them), and indeed you have already answered\r\nseveral points. Agassiz's name, no doubt, is a heavy weight against\r\nus...\r\n\r\nIf you see Professor Parsons, will you thank him for the extremely\r\nliberal and fair spirit in which his Essay ('Silliman's Journal,' July,\r\n1860.) is written. Please tell him that I reflected much on the chance\r\nof favourable monstrosities (i.e. great and sudden variation) arising.\r\nI have, of course, no objection to this, indeed it would be a great aid,\r\nbut I do not allude to the subject, for, after much labour, I could find\r\nnothing which satisfied me of the probability of such occurrences.\r\nThere seems to me in almost every case too much, too complex, and too\r\nbeautiful adaptation, in every structure, to believe in its sudden\r\nproduction. I have alluded under the head of beautifully hooked seeds\r\nto such possibility. Monsters are apt to be sterile, or NOT to transmit\r\nmonstrous peculiarities. Look at the fineness of gradation in the shells\r\nof successive SUB-STAGES of the same great formation; I could give\r\nmany other considerations which made me doubt such view. It holds, to a\r\ncertain extent, with domestic productions no doubt, where man preserves\r\nsome abrupt change in structure. It amused me to see Sir R. Murchison\r\nquoted as a judge of affinities of animals, and it gave me a cold\r\nshudder to hear of any one speculating about a true crustacean\r\ngiving birth to a true fish! (Parson's, loc. cit. page 5, speaking of\r\nPterichthys and Cephalaspis, says:--\"Now is it too much to infer from\r\nthese facts that either of these animals, if a crustacean, was so nearly\r\na fish that some of its ova may have become fish; or, if itself a fish,\r\nwas so nearly a crustacean that it may have been born from the ovum of a\r\ncrustacean?\")\r\n\r\nYours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, September 1st [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI have been much interested by your letter of the 28th, received this\r\nmorning. It has DELIGHTED me, because it demonstrates that you have\r\nthought a good deal lately on Natural Selection. Few things have\r\nsurprised me more than the entire paucity of objections and difficulties\r\nnew to me in the published reviews. Your remarks are of a different\r\nstamp and new to me. I will run through them, and make a few pleadings\r\nsuch as occur to me.\r\n\r\nI put in the possibility of the Galapagos having been CONTINUOUSLY\r\njoined to America, out of mere subservience to the many who believe in\r\nForbes's doctrine, and did not see the danger of admission, about small\r\nmammals surviving there in such case. The case of the Galapagos, from\r\ncertain facts on littoral sea-shells (viz. Pacific Ocean and South\r\nAmerican littoral species), in fact convinced me more than in any other\r\ncase of other islands, that the Galapagos had never been continuously\r\nunited with the mainland; it was mere base subservience, and terror of\r\nHooker and Co.\r\n\r\nWith respect to atolls, I think mammals would hardly survive VERY LONG,\r\neven if the main islands (for as I have said in the Coral Book, the\r\noutline of groups of atolls do not look like a former CONTINENT) had\r\nbeen tenanted by mammals, from the extremely small area, the very\r\npeculiar conditions, and the probability that during subsidence all or\r\nnearly all atolls have been breached and flooded by the sea many times\r\nduring their existence as atolls.\r\n\r\nI cannot conceive any existing reptile being converted into a mammal.\r\nFrom homologies I should look at it as certain that all mammals had\r\ndescended from some single progenitor. What its nature was, it is\r\nimpossible to speculate. More like, probably, the Ornithorhynchus\r\nor Echidna than any known form; as these animals combine reptilian\r\ncharacters (and in a less degree bird character) with mammalian. We\r\nmust imagine some form as intermediate, as is Lepidosiren now, between\r\nreptiles and fish, between mammals and birds on the one hand (for they\r\nretain longer the same embryological character) and reptiles on the\r\nother hand. With respect to a mammal not being developed on any island,\r\nbesides want of time for so prodigious a development, there must have\r\narrived on the island the necessary and peculiar progenitor, having\r\na character like the embryo of a mammal; and not an ALREADY DEVELOPED\r\nreptile, bird or fish.\r\n\r\nWe might give to a bird the habits of a mammal, but inheritance would\r\nretain almost for eternity some of the bird-like structure, and prevent\r\na new creature ranking as a true mammal.\r\n\r\nI have often speculated on antiquity of islands, but not with your\r\nprecision, or at all under the point of view of Natural Selection NOT\r\nhaving done what might have been anticipated. The argument of littoral\r\nMiocene shells at the Canary Islands is new to me. I was deeply\r\nimpressed (from the amount of the denudation) [with the] antiquity of\r\nSt. Helena, and its age agrees with the peculiarity of the flora. With\r\nrespect to bats at New Zealand (N.B. There are two or three European\r\nbats in Madeira, and I think in the Canary Islands) not having given\r\nrise to a group of non-volant bats, it is, now you put the case,\r\nsurprising; more especially as the genus of bats in New Zealand is very\r\npeculiar, and therefore has probably been long introduced, and they now\r\nspeak of Cretacean fossils there. But the first necessary step has to\r\nbe shown, namely, of a bat taking to feed on the ground, or anyhow, and\r\nanywhere, except in the air. I am bound to confess I do know one single\r\nsuch fact, viz. of an Indian species killing frogs. Observe, that in my\r\nwretched Polar Bear case, I do show the first step by which conversion\r\ninto a whale \"would be easy,\" \"would offer no difficulty\"!! So with\r\nseals, I know of no fact showing any the least incipient variation of\r\nseals feeding on the shore. Moreover, seals wander much; I searched in\r\nvain, and could not find ONE case of any species of seal confined to\r\nany islands. And hence wanderers would be apt to cross with individuals\r\nundergoing any change on an island, as in the case of land birds of\r\nMadeira and Bermuda. The same remark applies even to bats, as they\r\nfrequently come to Bermuda from the mainland, though about 600 miles\r\ndistant. With respect to the Amblyrhynchus of the Galapagos, one may\r\ninfer as probable, from marine habits being so rare with Saurians, and\r\nfrom the terrestrial species being confined to a few central islets,\r\nthat its progenitor first arrived at the Galapagos; from what country it\r\nis impossible to say, as its affinity I believe is not very clear to\r\nany known species. The offspring of the terrestrial species was probably\r\nrendered marine. Now in this case I do not pretend I can show variation\r\nin habits; but we have in the terrestrial species a vegetable feeder (in\r\nitself a rather unusual circumstance), largely on LICHENS, and it would\r\nnot be a great change for its offspring to feed first on littoral algae\r\nand then on submarine algae. I have said what I can in defence, but\r\nyours is a good line of attack. We should, however, always remember\r\nthat no change will ever be effected till a variation in the habits or\r\nstructure or of both CHANCE to occur in the right direction, so as\r\nto give the organism in question an advantage over other already\r\nestablished occupants of land or water, and this may be in any\r\nparticular case indefinitely long. I am very glad you will read my dogs\r\nMS., for it will be important to me to see what you think of the balance\r\nof evidence. After long pondering on a subject it is often hard to\r\njudge. With hearty thanks for your most interesting letter. Farewell.\r\n\r\nMy dear old master, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, September 2nd [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI am astounded at your news received this morning. I am become such an\r\nold fogy that I am amazed at your spirit. For God's sake do not go and\r\nget your throat cut. Bless my soul, I think you must be a little insane.\r\nI must confess it will be a most interesting tour; and, if you get\r\nto the top of Lebanon, I suppose extremely interesting--you ought to\r\ncollect any beetles under stones there; but the Entomologists are such\r\nslow coaches. I dare say no result could be made out of them. [They]\r\nhave never worked the Alpines of Britain.\r\n\r\nIf you come across any Brine lakes, do attend to their minute flora and\r\nfauna; I have often been surprised how little this has been attended to.\r\n\r\nI have had a long letter from Lyell, who starts ingenious difficulties\r\nopposed to Natural Selection, because it has not done more than it\r\nhas. This is very good, as it shows that he has thoroughly mastered the\r\nsubject; and shows he is in earnest. Very striking letter altogether and\r\nit rejoices the cockles of my heart.\r\n\r\n... How I shall miss you, my best and kindest of friends. God bless you.\r\n\r\nYours ever affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, September 10 [1860].\r\n\r\n... You will be weary of my praise, but it (Dr. Gray in the 'Atlantic\r\nMonthly' for July, 1860.) does strike me as quite admirably argued, and\r\nso well and pleasantly written. Your many metaphors are inimitably good.\r\nI said in a former letter that you were a lawyer, but I made a gross\r\nmistake, I am sure that you are a poet. No, by Jove, I will tell you\r\nwhat you are, a hybrid, a complex cross of lawyer, poet, naturalist and\r\ntheologian! Was there ever such a monster seen before?\r\n\r\nI have just looked through the passages which I have marked as appearing\r\nto me extra good, but I see that they are too numerous to specify, and\r\nthis is no exaggeration. My eye just alights on the happy comparison\r\nof the colours of the prism and our artificial groups. I see one little\r\nerror of fossil CATTLE in South America.\r\n\r\nIt is curious how each one, I suppose, weighs arguments in a different\r\nbalance: embryology is to me by far the strongest single class of facts\r\nin favour of change of forms, and not one, I think, of my reviewers has\r\nalluded to this. Variation not coming on at a very early age, and being\r\ninherited at not a very early corresponding period, explains, as it\r\nseems to me, the grandest of all facts in natural history, or rather in\r\nzoology, viz. the resemblance of embryos.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Dr. Gray wrote three articles in the 'Atlantic Monthly' for July,\r\nAugust, and October, which were reprinted as a pamphlet in 1861, and\r\nnow form chapter iii. in 'Darwiniana' (1876), with the heading 'Natural\r\nSelection not inconsistent with Natural Theology.']\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL Down, September 12th [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI never thought of showing your letter to any one. I mentioned in a\r\nletter to Hooker that I had been much interested by a letter of yours\r\nwith original objections, founded chiefly on Natural Selection not\r\nhaving done so much as might have been expected... In your letter just\r\nreceived, you have improved your case versus Natural Selection; and it\r\nwould tell with the public (do not be tempted by its novelty to make\r\nit too strong); yet is seems to me, not REALLY very killing, though I\r\ncannot answer your case, especially, why Rodents have not become\r\nhighly developed in Australia. You must assume that they have inhabited\r\nAustralia for a very long period, and this may or may not be the case.\r\nBut I feel that our ignorance is so profound, why one form is preserved\r\nwith nearly the same structure, or advances in organisation or even\r\nretrogrades, or becomes extinct, that I cannot put very great weight on\r\nthe difficulty. Then, as you say often in your letter, we know not how\r\nmany geological ages it may have taken to make any great advance in\r\norganisation. Remember monkeys in the Eocene formations: but I admit\r\nthat you have made out an excellent objection and difficulty, and I\r\ncan give only unsatisfactory and quite vague answers, such as you have\r\nyourself put; however, you hardly put weight enough on the absolute\r\nnecessity of variations first arising in the right direction, videlicet,\r\nof seals beginning to feed on the shore.\r\n\r\nI entirely agree with what you say about only one species of many\r\nbecoming modified. I remember this struck me much when tabulating the\r\nvarieties of plants, and I have a discussion somewhere on this point. It\r\nis absolutely implied in my ideas of classification and divergence\r\nthat only one or two species, of even large genera, give birth to new\r\nspecies; and many whole genera become WHOLLY extinct... Please see page\r\n341 of the 'Origin.' But I cannot remember that I have stated in the\r\n'Origin' the fact of only very few species in each genus varying. You\r\nhave put the view much better in your letter. Instead of saying, as I\r\noften have, that very few species vary at the same time, I ought to\r\nhave said, that very few species of a genus EVER vary so as to become\r\nmodified; for this is the fundamental explanation of classification, and\r\nis shown in my engraved diagram...\r\n\r\nI quite agree with you on the strange and inexplicable fact of\r\nOrnithorhynchus having been preserved, and Australian Trigonia, or the\r\nSilurian Lingula. I always repeat to myself that we hardly know why any\r\none single species is rare or common in the best-known countries. I have\r\ngot a set of notes somewhere on the inhabitants of fresh water; and it\r\nis singular how many of these are ancient, or intermediate forms; which\r\nI think is explained by the competition having been less severe, and\r\nthe rate of change of organic forms having been slower in small confined\r\nareas, such as all the fresh waters make compared with sea or land.\r\n\r\nI see that you do allude in the last page, as a difficulty, to\r\nMarsupials not having become Placentals in Australia; but this I think\r\nyou have no right at all to expect; for we ought to look at Marsupials\r\nand Placentals as having descended from some intermediate and lower\r\nform. The argument of Rodents not having become highly developed\r\nin Australia (supposing that they have long existed there) is much\r\nstronger. I grieve to see you hint at the creation \"of distinct\r\nsuccessive types, as well as of a certain number of distinct aboriginal\r\ntypes.\" Remember, if you admit this, you give up the embryological\r\nargument (THE WEIGHTIEST OF ALL TO ME), and the morphological or\r\nhomological argument. You cut my throat, and your own throat; and I\r\nbelieve will live to be sorry for it. So much for species.\r\n\r\nThe striking extract which E. copied was your own writing!! in a note to\r\nme, many long years ago--which she copied and sent to Mme. Sismondi; and\r\nlately my aunt, in sorting her letters, found E.'s and returned them\r\nto her... I have been of late shamefully idle, i.e. observing (Drosera)\r\ninstead of writing, and how much better fun observing is than writing.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. 15 Marine Parade, Eastbourne, Sunday\r\n[September 23rd, 1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI got your letter of the 18th just before starting here. You speak of\r\nsaving me trouble in answering. Never think of this, for I look at every\r\nletter of yours as an honour and pleasure, which is a pretty deal more\r\nthan I can say of some of the letters which I receive. I have now one of\r\n13 CLOSELY WRITTEN FOLIO PAGES to answer on species!...\r\n\r\nI have a very decided opinion that all mammals must have descended from\r\na SINGLE parent. Reflect on the multitude of details, very many of them\r\nof extremely little importance to their habits (as the number of\r\nbones of the head, etc., covering of hair, identical embryological\r\ndevelopment, etc. etc.). Now this large amount of similarity I must look\r\nat as certainly due to inheritance from a common stock. I am aware that\r\nsome cases occur in which a similar or nearly similar organ has been\r\nacquired by independent acts of natural selection. But in most of such\r\ncases of these apparently so closely similar organs, some important\r\nhomological difference may be detected. Please read page 193, beginning,\r\n\"The electric organs,\" and trust me that the sentence, \"In all these\r\ncases of two very distinct species,\" etc. etc., was not put in rashly,\r\nfor I went carefully into every case. Apply this argument to the whole\r\nframe, internal and external, of mammifers, and you will see why I think\r\nso strongly that all have descended from one progenitor. I have just\r\nre-read your letter, and I am not perfectly sure that I understand your\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nI enclose two diagrams showing the sort of manner I CONJECTURE that\r\nmammals have been developed. I thought a little on this when writing\r\npage 429, beginning, \"Mr. Waterhouse.\" (Please read the paragraph.) I\r\nhave not knowledge enough to choose between these two diagrams. If the\r\nbrain of Marsupials in embryo closely resembles that of Placentals,\r\nI should strongly prefer No.2, and this agrees with the antiquity of\r\nMicrolestes. As a general rule I should prefer No.1 diagram; whether or\r\nnot Marsupials have gone on being developed, or rising in rank, from a\r\nvery early period would depend on circumstances too complex for even\r\na conjecture. Lingula has not risen since the Silurian epoch, whereas\r\nother molluscs may have risen.\r\n\r\nHere appear two diagrams.\r\n\r\nDiagram I.\r\n\r\nA - Mammals, not true Marsupials nor true Placentals. - 2 branches -\r\nBranch I, True Placental, from which branch off Rodents, Insectivora, a\r\nbranch terminating in Ruminants and Pachyderms, Canidae and terminates\r\nin Quadrumana. - Branch II, True Marsupial, from which branches off\r\nKangaroo family an unnamed branch terminating in 2 unnamed branches and\r\nterminates in Didelphys Family.\r\n\r\nDiagram II.\r\n\r\nA - True Marsupials, lowly developed. - True Marsupials, highly\r\ndeveloped. - 2 branches - Branch I, Placentals, from which branch off\r\nRodents, Insectivora, a branch terminating in Ruminants and Pachyderms,\r\nCanidae and terminates in Quadrumana. - Branch II, Present Marsupials,\r\nsplitting into two branches terminating in Kangaroo family (with 2\r\nunnamed branches) and Didelphys family.\r\n\r\nA, in the two diagrams, represents an unknown form, probably\r\nintermediate between Mammals, Reptiles, and Birds, as intermediate as\r\nLepidosiren now is between Fish and Batrachians. This unknown form is\r\nprobably more closely related to Ornithorhynchus than to any other known\r\nform.\r\n\r\nI do not think that the multiple origin of dogs goes against the single\r\norigin of man... All the races of man are so infinitely closer together\r\nthan to any ape, that (as in the case of descent of all mammals from\r\none progenitor), I should look at all races of men as having certainly\r\ndescended from one parent. I should look at it as probable that the\r\nraces of men were less numerous and less divergent formerly than\r\nnow, unless, indeed, some lower and more aberrant race even than the\r\nHottentot has become extinct. Supposing, as I do for one believe, that\r\nour dogs have descended from two or three wolves, jackals, etc.,\r\nyet these have, on OUR VIEW, descended from a single remote unknown\r\nprogenitor. With domestic dogs the question is simply whether the whole\r\namount of difference has been produced since man domesticated a single\r\nspecies; or whether part of the difference arises in the state of\r\nnature. Agassiz and Co. think the negro and Caucasian are now distinct\r\nspecies, and it is a mere vain discussion whether, when they were rather\r\nless distinct, they would, on this standard of specific value, deserve\r\nto be called species.\r\n\r\nI agree with your answer which you give to yourself on this point; and\r\nthe simile of man now keeping down any new man which might be developed,\r\nstrikes me as good and new. The white man is \"improving off the face\r\nof the earth\" even races nearly his equals. With respect to islands, I\r\nthink I would trust to want of time alone, and not to bats and Rodents.\r\n\r\nN.B.--I know of no rodents on oceanic islands (except my Galapagos\r\nmouse, which MAY have been introduced by man) keeping down the\r\ndevelopment of other classes. Still MUCH more weight I should attribute\r\nto there being now, neither in islands nor elsewhere, [any] known\r\nanimals of a grade of organisation intermediate between mammals,\r\nfish, reptiles, etc., whence a new mammal could be developed. If\r\nevery vertebrate were destroyed throughout the world, except our NOW\r\nWELL-ESTABLISHED reptiles, millions of ages might elapse before reptiles\r\ncould become highly developed on a scale equal to mammals; and, on the\r\nprinciple of inheritance, they would make some quite NEW CLASS, and not\r\nmammals; though POSSIBLY more intellectual! I have not an idea that you\r\nwill care for this letter, so speculative.\r\n\r\nMost truly yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, September 26 [1860].\r\n\r\n... I have had a letter of fourteen folio pages from Harvey against my\r\nbook, with some ingenious and new remarks; but it is an extraordinary\r\nfact that he does not understand at all what I mean by Natural\r\nSelection. I have begged him to read the Dialogue in next 'Silliman,' as\r\nyou never touch the subject without making it clearer. I look at it\r\nas even more extraordinary that you never say a word or use an epithet\r\nwhich does not express fully my meaning. Now Lyell, Hooker, and others,\r\nwho perfectly understand my book, yet sometimes use expressions to which\r\nI demur. Well, your extraordinary labour is over; if there is any fair\r\namount of truth in my view, I am well assured that your great labour has\r\nnot been thrown away...\r\n\r\nI yet hope and almost believe, that the time will come when you will go\r\nfurther, in believing a very large amount of modification of species,\r\nthan you did at first or do now. Can you tell me whether you believe\r\nfurther or more firmly than you did at first? I should really like to\r\nknow this. I can perceive in my immense correspondence with Lyell, who\r\nobjected to much at first, that he has, perhaps unconsciousnessly to\r\nhimself, converted himself very much during the last six months, and\r\nI think this is the case even with Hooker. This fact gives me far more\r\nconfidence than any other fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. 15 Marine Parade, Eastbourne, Friday evening\r\n[September 28th, 1860].\r\n\r\n... I am very glad to hear about the Germans reading my book. No one will\r\nbe converted who has not independently begun to doubt about species. Is\r\nnot Krohn (There are two papers by Aug. Krohn, one on the Cement Glands,\r\nand the other on the development of Cirripedes, 'Wiegmann's Archiv,'\r\nxxv. and xxvi. My father has remarked that he \"blundered dreadfully\r\nabout the cement glands,\" 'Autobiography.') a good fellow? I have\r\nlong meant to write to him. He has been working at Cirripedes, and has\r\ndetected two or three gigantic blunders,... about which, I thank Heaven,\r\nI spoke rather doubtfully. Such difficult dissection that even Huxley\r\nfailed. It is chiefly the interpretation which I put on parts that is\r\nso wrong, and not the parts which I describe. But they were gigantic\r\nblunders, and why I say all this is because Krohn, instead of crowing at\r\nall, pointed out my errors with the utmost gentleness and pleasantness.\r\nI have always meant to write to him and thank him. I suppose Dr. Krohn,\r\nBonn, would reach him.\r\n\r\nI cannot see yet how the multiple origin of dog can be properly brought\r\nas argument for the multiple origin of man. Is not your feeling a\r\nremnant of the deeply impressed one on all our minds, that a species is\r\nan entity, something quite distinct from a variety? Is it not that the\r\ndog case injures the argument from fertility, so that one main argument\r\nthat the races of man are varieties and not species--i.e., because they\r\nare fertile inter se, is much weakened?\r\n\r\nI quite agree with what Hooker says, that whatever variation is possible\r\nunder culture, is POSSIBLE under nature; not that the same form would\r\never be accumulated and arrived at by selection for man's pleasure, and\r\nby natural selection for the organism's own good.\r\n\r\nTalking of \"natural selection;\" if I had to commence de novo, I would\r\nhave used \"natural preservation.\" For I find men like Harvey of Dublin\r\ncannot understand me, though he has read the book twice. Dr. Gray of the\r\nBritish Museum remarked to me that, \"SELECTION was obviously impossible\r\nwith plants! No one could tell him how it could be possible!\" And he may\r\nnow add that the author did not attempt it to him!\r\n\r\nYours ever affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. 15 Marine Parade, Eastbourne, October 8th\r\n[1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI send the [English] translation of Bronn (A MS. translation of Bronn's\r\nchapter of objections at the end of his German translation of the\r\n'Origin of Species.'), the first part of the chapter with generalities\r\nand praise is not translated. There are some good hits. He makes an\r\napparently, and in part truly, telling case against me, says that I\r\ncannot explain why one rat has a longer tail and another longer ears,\r\netc. But he seems to muddle in assuming that these parts did not all\r\nvary together, or one part so insensibly before the other, as to be\r\nin fact contemporaneous. I might ask the creationist whether he thinks\r\nthese differences in the two rats of any use, or as standing in some\r\nrelation from laws of growth; and if he admits this, selection might\r\ncome into play. He who thinks that God created animals unlike for mere\r\nsport or variety, as man fashions his clothes, will not admit any force\r\nin my argumentum ad hominem.\r\n\r\nBronn blunders about my supposing several Glacial periods, whether or no\r\nsuch ever did occur.\r\n\r\nHe blunders about my supposing that development goes on at the same rate\r\nin all parts of the world. I presume that he has misunderstood this from\r\nthe supposed migration into all regions of the more dominant forms.\r\n\r\nI have ordered Dr. Bree ('Species not Transmutable,' by C.R. Bree,\r\n1860.), and will lend it to you, if you like, and if it turns out good.\r\n\r\n... I am very glad that I misunderstood you about species not having the\r\ncapacity to vary, though in fact few do give birth to new species. It\r\nseems that I am very apt to misunderstand you; I suppose I am always\r\nfancying objections. Your case of the Red Indian shows me that we agree\r\nentirely...\r\n\r\nI had a letter yesterday from Thwaites of Ceylon, who was much opposed\r\nto me. He now says, \"I find that the more familiar I become with your\r\nviews in connection with the various phenomena of nature, the more they\r\ncommend themselves to my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.M. RODWELL. (Rev. J.M. Rodwell, who was at Cambridge\r\nwith my father, remembers him saying:--\"It strikes me that all our\r\nknowledge about the structure of our earth is very much like what an\r\nold hen would know of a hundred acre field, in a corner of which she is\r\nscratching.\") 15 Marine Parade, Eastbourne. November 5th [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am extremely much obliged for your letter, which I can compare only to\r\na plum-pudding, so full it is of good things. I have been rash about the\r\ncats (\"Cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf,\" 'Origin of Species,'\r\nedition i. page 12.): yet I spoke on what seemed to me, good authority.\r\nThe Rev. W.D. Fox gave me a list of cases of various foreign breeds\r\nin which he had observed the correlation, and for years he had vainly\r\nsought an exception. A French paper also gives numerous cases, and one\r\nvery curious case of a kitten which GRADUALLY lost the blue colour in\r\nits eyes and as gradually acquired its power of hearing. I had not\r\nheard of your uncle, Mr. Kirby's case (William Kirby, joint author with\r\nSpence, of the well-known 'Introduction to Entomology,' 1818.) (whom I,\r\nfor as long as I can remember, have venerated) of care in breeding cats.\r\nI do not know whether Mr. Kirby was your uncle by marriage, but your\r\nletters show me that you ought to have Kirby blood in your veins, and\r\nthat if you had not taken to languages you would have been a first-rate\r\nnaturalist.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that you will be able to carry out your intention of\r\nwriting on the \"Birth, Life, and Death of Words.\" Anyhow, you have a\r\ncapital title, and some think this the most difficult part of a book. I\r\nremember years ago at the Cape of Good Hope, Sir J. Herschel saying to\r\nme, I wish some one would treat language as Lyell has treated geology.\r\nWhat a linguist you must be to translate the Koran! Having a vilely bad\r\nhead for languages, I feel an awful respect for linguists.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether my brother-in-law, Hensleigh Wedgwood's\r\n'Etymological Dictionary' would be at all in your line; but he\r\ntreats briefly on the genesis of words; and, as it seems to me, very\r\ningeniously. You kindly say that you would communicate any facts which\r\nmight occur to you, and I am sure that I should be most grateful. Of\r\nthe multitude of letters which I receive, not one in a thousand is like\r\nyours in value.\r\n\r\nWith my cordial thanks, and apologies for this untidy letter written in\r\nhaste, pray believe me, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours sincerely obliged, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. November 20th [1860].\r\n\r\n... I have not had heart to read Phillips ('Life on the Earth.') yet, or\r\na tremendous long hostile review by Professor Bowen in the 4to Mem. of\r\nthe American Academy of Sciences. (\"Remarks on the latest form of the\r\nDevelopment Theory.\" By Francis Bowen, Professor of Natural Religion and\r\nMoral Philosophy, at Harvard University. 'American Academy of Arts and\r\nSciences,' vol. viii.) (By the way, I hear Agassiz is going to thunder\r\nagainst me in the next part of the 'Contributions.') Thank you for\r\ntelling me of the sale of the 'Origin,' of which I had not heard. There\r\nwill be some time, I presume, a new edition, and I especially want your\r\nadvice on one point, and you know I think you the wisest of men, and I\r\nshall be ABSOLUTELY GUIDED BY YOUR ADVICE. It has occurred to me, that\r\nit would PERHAPS be a good plan to put a set of notes (some twenty to\r\nforty or fifty) to the 'Origin,' which now has none, exclusively devoted\r\nto errors of my reviewers. It has occurred to me that where a reviewer\r\nhas erred, a common reader might err. Secondly, it will show the reader\r\nthat he must not trust implicitly to reviewers. Thirdly, when any\r\nspecial fact has been attacked, I should like to defend it. I would show\r\nno sort of anger. I enclose a mere rough specimen, done without any care\r\nor accuracy--done from memory alone--to be torn up, just to show the\r\nsort of thing that has occurred to me. WILL YOU DO ME THE GREAT KINDNESS\r\nTO CONSIDER THIS WELL?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me it would have a good effect, and give some confidence to\r\nthe reader. It would [be] a horrid bore going through all the reviews.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Here follow samples of foot-notes, the references to volume and page\r\nbeing left blank. It will be seen that in some cases he seems to have\r\nforgotten that he was writing foot-notes, and to have continued as if\r\nwriting to Lyell:--\r\n\r\n*Dr. Bree asserts that I explain the structure of the cells of the Hive\r\nBee by \"the exploded doctrine of pressure.\" But I do not say one word\r\nwhich directly or indirectly can be interpreted into any reference to\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n*The 'Edinburgh' Reviewer quotes my work as saying that the \"dorsal\r\nvertebrae of pigeons vary in number, and disputes the fact.\" I nowhere\r\neven allude to the dorsal vertebrae, only to the sacral and caudal\r\nvertebrae.\r\n\r\n*The 'Edinburgh' Reviewer throws a doubt on these organs being the\r\nBranchiae of Cirripedes. But Professor Owen in 1854 admits, without\r\nhesitation, that they are Branchiae, as did John Hunter long ago.\r\n\r\n*The confounded Wealden Calculation to be struck out, and a note to\r\nbe inserted to the effect that I am convinced of its inaccuracy from\r\na review in the \"Saturday Review\", and from Phillips, as I see in his\r\nTable of Contents that he alludes to it.\r\n\r\n*Mr. Hopkins ('Fraser') states--I am quoting only from vague\r\nmemory--that, \"I argue in favour of my views from the extreme\r\nimperfection of the Geological Record,\" and says this is the first time\r\nin the history of Science he has ever heard of ignorance being adduced\r\nas an argument. But I repeatedly admit, in the most emphatic language\r\nwhich I can use, that the imperfect evidence which Geology offers in\r\nregard to transitorial forms is most strongly opposed to my views.\r\nSurely there is a wide difference in fully admitting an objection, and\r\nthen in endeavouring to show that it is not so strong as it at first\r\nappears, and in Mr. Hopkins's assertion that I found my argument on the\r\nObjection.\r\n\r\n*I would also put a note to \"Natural Selection,\" and show how variously\r\nit has been misunderstood.\r\n\r\n*A writer in the 'Edinburgh Philosophical Journal' denies my statement\r\nthat the Woodpecker of La Plata never frequents trees. I observed its\r\nhabits during two years, but, what is more to the purpose, Azara, whose\r\naccuracy all admit, is more emphatic than I am in regard to its never\r\nfrequenting trees. Mr. A. Murray denies that it ought to be called\r\na woodpecker; it has two toes in front and two behind, pointed tail\r\nfeathers, a long pointed tongue, and the same general form of body,\r\nthe same manner of flight, colouring and voice. It was classed, until\r\nrecently, in the same genus--Picus--with all other woodpeckers, but now\r\nhas been ranked as a distinct genus amongst the Picidae. It differs from\r\nthe typical Picus only in the beak, not being quite so strong, and in\r\nthe upper mandible being slightly arched. I think these facts fully\r\njustify my statement that it is \"in all essential parts of its\r\norganisation\" a Woodpecker.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, November 22 [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nFor heaven's sake don't write an anti-Darwinian article; you would do it\r\nso confoundedly well. I have sometimes amused myself with thinking how\r\nI could best pitch into myself, and I believe I could give two or three\r\ngood digs; but I will see you -- first before I will try. I shall be\r\nvery impatient to see the Review. (The first number of the new series of\r\nthe 'Nat. Hist. Review' appeared in 1861.) If it succeeds it may really\r\ndo much, very much good...\r\n\r\nI heard to-day from Murray that I must set to work at once on a new\r\nedition (The 3rd edition.) of the 'Origin.' [Murray] says the Reviews\r\nhave not improved the sale. I shall always think those early reviews,\r\nalmost entirely yours, did the subject an ENORMOUS service. If you\r\nhave any important suggestions or criticisms to make on any part of the\r\n'Origin,' I should, of course, be very grateful for [them]. For I mean\r\nto correct as far as I can, but not enlarge. How you must be wearied\r\nwith and hate the subject, and it is God's blessing if you do not get to\r\nhate me. Adios.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, November 24th [1860].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI thank you much for your letter. I had got to take pleasure in thinking\r\nhow I could best snub my reviewers; but I was determined, in any case,\r\nto follow your advice, and, before I had got to the end of your letter,\r\nI was convinced of the wisdom of your advice. (\"I get on slowly with\r\nmy new edition. I find that your advice was EXCELLENT. I can answer all\r\nreviews, without any direct notice of them, by a little enlargement\r\nhere and there, with here and there a new paragraph. Bronn alone I shall\r\ntreat with the respect of giving his objections with his name. I think\r\nI shall improve my book a good deal, and add only some twenty\r\npages.\"--From a letter to Lyell, December 4th, 1860.) What an advantage\r\nit is to me to have such friends as you. I shall follow every hint in\r\nyour letter exactly.\r\n\r\nI have just heard from Murray; he says he sold 700 copies at his sale,\r\nand that he has not half the number to supply; so that I must begin\r\nat once (On the third edition of the 'Origin of Species,' published in\r\nApril 1861.)...\r\n\r\nP.S.--I must tell you one little fact which has pleased me. You may\r\nremember that I adduce electrical organs of fish as one of the greatest\r\ndifficulties which have occurred to me, and -- notices the passage in a\r\nsingularly disingenuous spirit. Well, McDonnell, of Dublin (a first-rate\r\nman), writes to me that he felt the difficulty of the whole case as\r\noverwhelming against me. Not only are the fishes which have electric\r\norgans very remote in scale, but the organ is near the head in some,\r\nand near the tail in others, and supplied by wholly different nerves. It\r\nseems impossible that there could be any transition. Some friend, who\r\nis much opposed to me, seems to have crowed over McDonnell, who\r\nreports that he said to himself, that if Darwin is right, there must\r\nbe homologous organs both near the head and tail in other non-electric\r\nfish. He set to work, and, by Jove, he has found them! ('On an organ in\r\nthe Skate, which appears to be the homologue of the electrical organ of\r\nthe Torpedo,' by R. McDonnell, 'Nat. Hist. Review,' 1861, page 57.) so\r\nthat some of the difficulty is removed; and is it not satisfactory that\r\nmy hypothetical notions should have led to pretty discoveries? McDonnell\r\nseems very cautious; he says, years must pass before he will venture to\r\ncall himself a believer in my doctrine, but that on the subjects which\r\nhe knows well, viz., Morphology and Embryology, my views accord well,\r\nand throw light on the whole subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, November 26th, 1860.\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI have to thank you for two letters. The latter with corrections,\r\nwritten before you received my letter asking for an American reprint,\r\nand saying that it was hopeless to print your reviews as a pamphlet,\r\nowing to the impossibility of getting pamphlets known. I am very glad to\r\nsay that the August or second 'Atlantic' article has been reprinted in\r\nthe 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History'; but I have not seen it\r\nthere. Yesterday I read over with care the third article; and it seems\r\nto me, as before, ADMIRABLE. But I grieve to say that I cannot honestly\r\ngo as far as you do about Design. I am conscious that I am in an utterly\r\nhopeless muddle. I cannot think that the world, as we see it, is the\r\nresult of chance; and yet I cannot look at each separate thing as the\r\nresult of Design. To take a crucial example, you lead me to infer\r\n(page 414) that you believe \"that variation has been led along certain\r\nbeneficial lines.\" I cannot believe this; and I think you would have to\r\nbelieve, that the tail of the Fantail was led to vary in the number and\r\ndirection of its feathers in order to gratify the caprice of a few men.\r\nYet if the Fantail had been a wild bird, and had used its abnormal tail\r\nfor some special end, as to sail before the wind, unlike other birds,\r\nevery one would have said, \"What a beautiful and designed adaptation.\"\r\nAgain, I say I am, and shall ever remain, in a hopeless muddle.\r\n\r\nThank you much for Bowen's 4to. review. ('Memoirs of the American\r\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences,' vol. viii.) The coolness with which he\r\nmakes all animals to be destitute of reason is simply absurd. It is\r\nmonstrous at page 103, that he should argue against the possibility of\r\naccumulative variation, and actually leave out, entirely, selection! The\r\nchance that an improved Short-horn, or improved Pouter-pigeon, should be\r\nproduced by accumulative variation without man's selection is as almost\r\ninfinity to nothing; so with natural species without natural selection.\r\nHow capitally in the 'Atlantic' you show that Geology and Astronomy\r\nare, according to Bowen, Metaphysics; but he leaves out this in the 4to.\r\nMemoir.\r\n\r\nI have not much to tell you about my Book. I have just heard that Du\r\nBoi-Reymond agrees with me. The sale of my book goes on well, and the\r\nmultitude of reviews has not stopped the sale...; so I must begin at\r\nonce on a new corrected edition. I will send you a copy for the chance\r\nof your ever re-reading; but, good Heavens, how sick you must be of it!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, December 2nd [1860].\r\n\r\n... I have got fairly sick of hostile reviews. Nevertheless, they have\r\nbeen of use in showing me when to expatiate a little and to introduce\r\na few new discussions. OF COURSE I will send you a copy of the new\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nI entirely agree with you, that the difficulties on my notions are\r\nterrific, yet having seen what all the Reviews have said against me,\r\nI have far more confidence in the GENERAL truth of the doctrine than I\r\nformerly had. Another thing gives me confidence, viz. that some who went\r\nhalf an inch with me now go further, and some who were bitterly\r\nopposed are now less bitterly opposed. And this makes me feel a little\r\ndisappointed that you are not inclined to think the general view in\r\nsome slight degree more probable than you did at first. This I consider\r\nrather ominous. Otherwise I should be more contented with your degree\r\nof belief. I can pretty plainly see that, if my view is ever to be\r\ngenerally adopted, it will be by young men growing up and replacing the\r\nold workers, and then young ones finding that they can group facts and\r\nsearch out new lines of investigation better on the notion of\r\ndescent, than on that of creation. But forgive me for running on so\r\negotistically. Living so solitary as I do, one gets to think in a silly\r\nmanner of one's own work.\r\n\r\nEver yours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 11th [1860].\r\n\r\n... I heard from A. Gray this morning; at my suggestion he is going to\r\nreprint the three 'Atlantic' articles as a pamphlet, and send 250\r\ncopies to England, for which I intend to pay half the cost of the\r\nwhole edition, and shall give away, and try to sell by getting a few\r\nadvertisements put in, and if possible notices in Periodicals.\r\n\r\n... David Forbes has been carefully working the Geology of Chile, and as\r\nI value praise for accurate observation far higher than for any other\r\nquality, forgive (if you can) the INSUFFERABLE vanity of my copying the\r\nlast sentence in his note: \"I regard your Monograph on Chile as, without\r\nexception, one of the finest specimens of Geological enquiry.\" I feel\r\ninclined to strut like a Turkey-cock!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.III. -- SPREAD OF EVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n1861-1862.\r\n\r\n[The beginning of the year 1861 saw my father with the third chapter of\r\n'The Variation of Animals and Plants' still on his hands. It had been\r\nbegun in the previous August, and was not finished until March 1861. He\r\nwas, however, for part of this time (I believe during December 1860 and\r\nJanuary 1861) engaged in a new edition (2000 copies) of the 'Origin,'\r\nwhich was largely corrected and added to, and was published in April\r\n1861.\r\n\r\nWith regard to this, the third edition, he wrote to Mr. Murray in\r\nDecember 1860:--\r\n\r\n\"I shall be glad to hear when you have decided how many copies you will\r\nprint off--the more the better for me in all ways, as far as compatible\r\nwith safety; for I hope never again to make so many corrections, or\r\nrather additions, which I have made in hopes of making my many rather\r\nstupid reviewers at least understand what is meant. I hope and think I\r\nshall improve the book considerably.\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature in the new edition was the \"Historical Sketch of\r\nthe Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species\" (The Historical\r\nSketch had already appeared in the first German edition (1860) and the\r\nAmerican edition. Bronn states in the German edition (footnote, page\r\n1) that it was his critique in the 'N. Jahrbuch fur Mineralogie' that\r\nsuggested the idea of such a sketch to my father.) which now appeared\r\nfor the first time, and was continued in the later editions of the work.\r\nIt bears a strong impress of the author's personal character in the\r\nobvious wish to do full justice to all his predecessors,--though even in\r\nthis respect it has not escaped some adverse criticism.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the present year (1861), the final arrangements\r\nfor the first French edition of the 'Origin' were completed, and in\r\nSeptember a copy of the third English edition was despatched to Mdlle.\r\nClemence Royer, who undertook the work of translation. The book was now\r\nspreading on the Continent, a Dutch edition had appeared, and, as we\r\nhave seen, a German translation had been published in 1860. In a letter\r\nto Mr. Murray (September 10, 1861), he wrote, \"My book seems exciting\r\nmuch attention in Germany, judging from the number of discussions sent\r\nme.\" The silence had been broken, and in a few years the voice of\r\nGerman science was to become one of the strongest of the advocates of\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nDuring all the early part of the year (1861) he was working at the\r\nmass of details which are marshalled in order in the early chapter of\r\n'Animals and Plants.' Thus in his Diary occur the laconic entries, \"May\r\n16, Finished Fowls (eight weeks); May 31, Ducks.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 1, he started, with his family, for Torquay, where he remained\r\nuntil August 27--a holiday which he characteristically enters in his\r\ndiary as \"eight weeks and a day.\" The house he occupied was in Hesketh\r\nCrescent, a pleasantly placed row of houses close above the sea,\r\nsomewhat removed from what was then the main body of the town, and\r\nnot far from the beautiful cliffed coast-line in the neighbourhood of\r\nAnstey's Cove.\r\n\r\nDuring the Torquay holiday, and for the remainder of the year, he worked\r\nat the fertilisation of orchids. This part of the year 1861 is not dealt\r\nwith in the present chapter, because (as explained in the preface) the\r\nrecord of his life, as told in his letters, seems to become clearer\r\nwhen the whole of his botanical work is placed together and treated\r\nseparately. The present series of chapters will, therefore, include only\r\nthe progress of his works in the direction of a general amplification of\r\nthe 'Origin of Species'--e.g., the publication of 'Animals and Plants,'\r\n'Descent of Man,' etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 15 [1861].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nThe sight of your handwriting always rejoices the very cockles of my\r\nheart...\r\n\r\nI most fully agree to what you say about Huxley's Article ('Natural\r\nHistory Review,' 1861, page 67, \"On the Zoological Relations of Man with\r\nthe Lower Animals.\" This memoir had its origin in a discussion at the\r\nprevious meeting of the British Association, when Professor Huxley\r\nfelt himself \"compelled to give a diametrical contradiction to certain\r\nassertions respecting the differences which obtain between the brains\r\nof the higher apes and of man, which fell from Professor Owen.\" But in\r\norder that his criticisms might refer to deliberately recorded words, he\r\nbases them on Professor Owen's paper, \"On the Characters, etc., of the\r\nClass Mammalia,\" read before the Linnean Society in February and April,\r\n1857, in which he proposed to place man not only in a distinct order,\r\nbut in \"a distinct su-class of the Mammalia\"--the Archencephala.),\r\nand the power of writing... The whole review seems to me excellent. How\r\ncapitally Oliver has done the resume of botanical books. Good Heavens,\r\nhow he must have read!...\r\n\r\nI quite agree that Phillips ('Life on the Earth' (1860), by Prof.\r\nPhillips, containing the substance of the Rede Lecture (May 1860).)\r\nis unreadably dull. You need not attempt Bree. (The following sentence\r\n(page 16) from 'Species not Transmutable,' by Dr. Bree, illustrates the\r\ndegree in which he understood the 'Origin of Species': \"The only real\r\ndifference between Mr. Darwin and his two predecessors\" [Lamarck and the\r\n'Vestiges'] \"is this:--that while the latter have each given a mode by\r\nwhich they conceive the great changes they believe in have been brought\r\nabout, Mr. Darwin does no such thing.\" After this we need not be\r\nsurprised at a passage in the preface: \"No one has derived greater\r\npleasure than I have in past days from the study of Mr. Darwin's other\r\nworks, and no one has felt a greater degree of regret that he should\r\nhave imperilled his fame by the publication of his treatise upon the\r\n'Origin of Species.'\")...\r\n\r\nIf you come across Dr. Freke on 'Origin of Species by means of Organic\r\nAffinity,' read a page here and there... He tells the reader to observe\r\n[that his result] has been arrived at by \"induction,\" whereas all my\r\nresults are arrived at only by \"analogy.\" I see a Mr. Neale has read\r\na paper before the Zoological Society on 'Typical Selection;' what it\r\nmeans I know not. I have not read H. Spencer, for I find that I must\r\nmore and more husband the very little strength which I have. I sometimes\r\nsuspect I shall soon entirely fail... As soon as this dreadful weather\r\ngets a little milder, I must try a little water cure. Have you read the\r\n'Woman in White'? the plot is wonderfully interesting. I can recommend\r\na book which has interested me greatly, viz. Olmsted's 'Journey in the\r\nBack Country.' It is an admirably lively picture of man and slavery in\r\nthe Southern States...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. February 2, 1861.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI have thought you would like to read the enclosed passage in a letter\r\nfrom A. Gray (who is printing his reviews as a pamphlet (\"Natural\r\nSelection not inconsistent with Natural Theology,\" from the 'Atlantic\r\nMonthly' for July, August, and October, 1860; published by Trubner.),\r\nand will send copies to England), as I think his account is really\r\nfavourable in high degree to us:--\r\n\r\n\"I wish I had time to write you an account of the lengths to which Bowen\r\nand Agassiz, each in their own way, are going. The first denying all\r\nheredity (all transmission except specific) whatever. The second\r\ncoming near to deny that we are genetically descended from our\r\ngreat-grea-grandfathers; and insisting that evidently affiliated\r\nlanguages, e.g. Latin, Greek, Sanscrit, owe none of their similarities\r\nto a community of origin, are all autochthonal; Agassiz admits that the\r\nderivation of languages, and that of species or forms, stand on the same\r\nfoundation, and that he must allow the latter if he allows the former,\r\nwhich I tell him is perfectly logical.\"\r\n\r\nIs not this marvellous?\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, February 4 [1861].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI was delighted to get your long chatty letter, and to hear that you are\r\nthawing towards science. I almost wish you had remained frozen rather\r\nlonger; but do not thaw too quickly and strongly. No one can work long\r\nas you used to do. Be idle; but I am a pretty man to preach, for I\r\ncannot be idle, much as I wish it, and am never comfortable except when\r\nat work. The word holiday is written in a dead language for me, and much\r\nI grieve at it. We thank you sincerely for your kind sympathy about\r\npoor H. [his daughter]... She has now come up to her old point, and can\r\nsometimes get up for an hour or two twice a day... Never to look to the\r\nfuture or as little as possible is becoming our rule of life. What\r\na different thing life was in youth with no dread in the future; all\r\ngolden, if baseless, hopes.\r\n\r\n... With respect to the 'Natural History Review' I can hardly think\r\nthat ladies would be so very sensitive about \"lizards' guts;\" but the\r\npublication is at present certainly a sort of hybrid, and original\r\nillustrated papers ought hardly to appear in a review. I doubt its ever\r\npaying; but I shall much regret if it dies. All that you say seems very\r\nsensible, but could a review in the strict sense of the word be filled\r\nwith readable matter?\r\n\r\nI have been doing little, except finishing the new edition of the\r\n'Origin,' and crawling on most slowly with my volume of 'Variation under\r\nDomestication'...\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter refers to Mr. Bates's paper, \"Contributions to\r\nan Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley,\" in the 'Transactions of the\r\nEntomological Society,' vol.5, N.S. (The paper was read November 24,\r\n1860.) Mr. Bates points out that with the return, after the glacial\r\nperiod, of a warmer climate in the equatorial regions, the \"species then\r\nliving near the equator would retreat north and south to their\r\nformer homes, leaving some of their congeners, slowly modified\r\nsubsequently... to re-people the zone they had forsaken.\" In this case\r\nthe species now living at the equator ought to show clear relationship\r\nto the species inhabiting the regions about the 25th parallel, whose\r\ndistant relatives they would of course be. But this is not the case,\r\nand this is the difficulty my father refers to. Mr. Belt has offered\r\nan explanation in his 'Naturalist in Nicaragua' (1874), page 266. \"I\r\nbelieve the answer is that there was much extermination during the\r\nglacial period, that many species (and some genera, etc., as, for\r\ninstance, the American horse), did not survive it... but that a refuge\r\nwas found for many species on lands now below the ocean, that were\r\nuncovered by the lowering of the sea, caused by the immense quantity of\r\nwater that was locked up in frozen masses on the land.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, 27th [March 1861].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI had intended to have sent you Bates's article this very day. I am so\r\nglad you like it. I have been extremely much struck with it. How well\r\nhe argues, and with what crushing force against the glacial doctrine. I\r\ncannot wriggle out of it: I am dumbfounded; yet I do believe that\r\nsome explanation some day will appear, and I cannot give up equatorial\r\ncooling. It explains so much and harmonises with so much. When you\r\nwrite (and much interested I shall be in your letter) please say how far\r\nfloras are generally uniform in generic character from 0 to 25 degrees\r\nN. and S.\r\n\r\nBefore reading Bates, I had become thoroughly dissatisfied with what I\r\nwrote to you. I hope you may get Bates to write in the 'Linnean.'\r\n\r\nHere is a good joke: H.C. Watson (who, I fancy and hope, is going to\r\nreview the new edition (third edition of 2000 copies, published in\r\nApril, 1861.) of the 'Origin') says that in the first four paragraphs of\r\nthe introduction, the words \"I,\" \"me,\" \"my,\" occur forty-three times!\r\nI was dimly conscious of the accursed fact. He says it can be explained\r\nphrenologically, which I suppose civilly means, that I am the most\r\negotistically self-sufficient man alive; perhaps so. I wonder whether\r\nhe will print this pleasing fact; it beats hollow the parentheses in\r\nWollaston's writing.\r\n\r\n_I_ am, MY dear Hooker, ever yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Do not spread this pleasing joke; it is rather too biting.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [April] 23? [1861].\r\n\r\n... I quite agree with what you say on Lieutenant Hutton's Review (In the\r\n'Geologist,' 1861, page 132, by Lieutenant Frederick Wollaston Hutton,\r\nnow Professor of Biology and Geology at Canterbury College, New\r\nZealand.) (who he is I know not); it struck me as very original. He\r\nis one of the very few who see that the change of species cannot be\r\ndirectly proved, and that the doctrine must sink or swim according as it\r\ngroups and explains phenomena. It is really curious how few judge it in\r\nthis way, which is clearly the right way. I have been much interested by\r\nBentham's paper (\"On the Species and Genera of Plants, etc.,\" 'Natural\r\nHistory Review,' 1861, page 133.) in the N.H.R., but it would not, of\r\ncourse, from familiarity strike you as it did me. I liked the whole; all\r\nthe facts on the nature of close and varying species. Good Heavens! to\r\nthink of the British botanists turning up their noses, and saying that\r\nhe knows nothing of British plants! I was also pleased at his remarks on\r\nclassification, because it showed me that I wrote truly on this subject\r\nin the 'Origin.' I saw Bentham at the Linnean Society, and had some\r\ntalk with him and Lubbock, and Edgeworth, Wallich, and several others. I\r\nasked Bentham to give us his ideas of species; whether partially with us\r\nor dead against us, he would write EXCELLENT matter. He made no answer,\r\nbut his manner made me think he might do so if urged; so do you attack\r\nhim. Every one was speaking with affection and anxiety of Henslow.\r\n(Prof. Henslow was in his last illness.) I dined with Bell at the\r\nLinnean Club, and liked my dinner... Dining out is such a novelty to\r\nme that I enjoyed it. Bell has a real good heart. I liked Rolleston's\r\npaper, but I never read anything so obscure and not sel-evident as his\r\n'Canons.' (George Rolleston, M.D., F.R.S., 1829-1881. Linacre Professor\r\nof Anatomy and Physiology at Oxford. A man of much learning, who left\r\nbut few published works, among which may be mentioned his handbook\r\n'Forms of Animal Life.' For the 'Canons,' see 'Nat. Hist. Review,' 1861,\r\npage 206.)... I called on R. Chambers, at his very nice house in St.\r\nJohn's Wood, and had a very pleasant half-hour's talk; he is really a\r\ncapital fellow. He made one good remark and chuckled over it, that\r\nthe laymen universally had treated the controversy on the 'Essays and\r\nReviews' as a merely professional subject, and had not joined in it, but\r\nhad left it to the clergy. I shall be anxious for your next letter about\r\nHenslow. (Sir Joseph Hooker was Prof. Henslow's son-in-law.) Farewell,\r\nwith sincere sympathy, my old friend,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--We are very much obliged for the 'London Review.' We like\r\nreading much of it, and the science is incomparably better than in the\r\n\"Athenaeum\". You shall not go on very long sending it, as you will be\r\nruined by pennies and trouble, but I am under a horrid spell to the\r\n\"Athenaeum\" and the \"Gardener's Chronicle\", but I have taken them in for\r\nso many years, that I CANNOT give them up.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The next letter refers to Lyell's visit to the Biddenham gravel-pits\r\nnear Bedford in April 1861. The visit was made at the invitation of Mr.\r\nJames Wyatt, who had recently discovered two stone implements \"at\r\nthe depth of thirteen feet from the surface of the soil,\" resting\r\n\"immediately on solid beds of oolitic-limestone.\" ('Antiquity of Man,'\r\nfourth edition, page 214.) Here, says Sir C. Lyell, \"I... for the first\r\ntime, saw evidence which satisfied me of the chronological relations of\r\nthose three phenomena--the antique tools, the extinct mammalia, and the\r\nglacial formation.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, April 12 [1861].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI have been most deeply interested by your letter. You seem to have done\r\nthe grandest work, and made the greatest step, of any one with respect\r\nto man.\r\n\r\nIt is an especial relief to hear that you think the French superficial\r\ndeposits are deltoid and semi-marine; but two days ago I was saying to\r\na friend, that the unknown manner of the accumulation of these deposits,\r\nseemed the great blot in all the work done. I could not stomach debacles\r\nor lacustrine beds. It is grand. I remember Falconer told me that he\r\nthought some of the remains in the Devonshire caverns were pre-glacial,\r\nand this, I presume, is now your conclusion for the older celts with\r\nhyena and hippopotamus. It is grand. What a fine long pedigree you have\r\ngiven the human race!\r\n\r\nI am sure I never thought of parallel roads having been accumulated\r\nduring subsidence. I think I see some difficulties on this view, though,\r\nat first reading your note, I jumped at the idea. But I will think over\r\nall I saw there. I am (stomacho volente) coming up to London on Tuesday\r\nto work on cocks and hens, and on Wednesday morning, about a quarter\r\nbefore ten, I will call on you (unless I hear to the contrary), for I\r\nlong to see you. I congratulate you on your grand work.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Tell Lady Lyell that I was unable to digest the funereal\r\nceremonies of the ants, notwithstanding that Erasmus has often told me\r\nthat I should find some day that they have their bishops. After a battle\r\nI have always seen the ants carry away the dead for food. Ants display\r\nthe utmost economy, and always carry away a dead fellow-creature as\r\nfood. But I have just forwarded two most extraordinary letters to Busk,\r\nfrom a backwoodsman in Texas, who has evidently watched ants carefully,\r\nand declares most positively that they plant and cultivate a kind of\r\ngrass for store food, and plant other bushes for shelter! I do not\r\nknow what to think, except that the old gentleman is not fibbing\r\nintentionally. I have left the responsibility with Busk whether or no to\r\nread the letters. (I.e. to read them before the Linnean Society.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO THOMAS DAVIDSON. (Thomas Davidson, F.R.S., born\r\nin Edinburgh, May 17, 1817; died 1885. His researches were chiefly\r\nconnected with the sciences of geology and palaeontology, and\r\nwere directed especially to the elucidation of the characters,\r\nclassification, history, geological and geographical distribution\r\nof recent and fossil Brachiopoda. On this subject he brought out an\r\nimportant work, 'British Fossil Brachiopoda,' 5 vols. 4to. (Cooper, 'Men\r\nof the Time,' 1884.)) Down, April 26, 1861.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI hope that you will excuse me for venturing to make a suggestion to\r\nyou which I am perfectly well aware it is a very remote chance that you\r\nwould adopt. I do not know whether you have read my 'Origin of\r\nSpecies'; in that book I have made the remark, which I apprehend will\r\nbe universally admitted, that AS A WHOLE, the fauna of any formation\r\nis intermediate in character between that of the formations above and\r\nbelow. But several really good judges have remarked to me how desirable\r\nit would be that this should be exemplified and worked out in some\r\ndetail and with some single group of beings. Now every one will admit\r\nthat no one in the world could do this better than you with Brachiopods.\r\nThe result might turn out very unfavourable to the views which I\r\nhold; if so, so much the better for those who are opposed to me. (\"Mr.\r\nDavidson is not at all a full believer in great changes of species,\r\nwhich will make his work all the more valuable.--C. Darwin to R.\r\nChambers (April 30, 1861).) But I am inclined to suspect that on the\r\nwhole it would be favourable to the notion of descent with modification;\r\nfor about a year ago, Mr. Salter (John William Salter; 1820- 1869. He\r\nentered the service of the Geological Survey in 1846, and ultimately\r\nbecame its Palaeontologist, on the retirement of Edward Forbes, and\r\ngave up the office in 1863. He was associated with several well-known\r\nnaturalists in their work--with Sedgwick, Murchison, Lyell, Ramsay,\r\nand Huxley. There are sixty entries under his name in the Royal Society\r\nCatalogue. The above facts are taken from an obituary notice of Mr.\r\nSalter in the 'Geological Magazine,' 1869.) in the Museum in Jermyn\r\nStreet, glued on a board some Spirifers, etc., from three palaeozoic\r\nstages, and arranged them in single and branching lines, with horizontal\r\nlines marking the formations (like the diagram in my book, if you\r\nknow it), and the result seemed to me very striking, though I was too\r\nignorant fully to appreciate the lines of affinities. I longed to have\r\nhad these shells engraved, as arranged by Mr. Salter, and connected by\r\ndotted lines, and would have gladly paid the expense: but I could not\r\npersuade Mr. Salter to publish a little paper on the subject. I can\r\nhardly doubt that many curious points would occur to any one thoroughly\r\ninstructed in the subject, who would consider a group of beings under\r\nthis point of view of descent with modification. All those forms which\r\nhave come down from an ancient period very slightly modified ought,\r\nI think, to be omitted, and those forms alone considered which have\r\nundergone considerable change at each successive epoch. My fear\r\nis whether brachiopods have changed enough. The absolute amount of\r\ndifference of the forms in such groups at the opposite extremes of time\r\nought to be considered, and how far the early forms are intermediate in\r\ncharacter between those which appeared much later in time. The antiquity\r\nof a group is not really diminished, as some seem vaguely to think,\r\nbecause it has transmitted to the present day closely allied forms.\r\nAnother point is how far the succession of each genus is unbroken, from\r\nthe first time it appeared to its extinction, with due allowance made\r\nfor formations poor in fossils. I cannot but think that an important\r\nessay (far more important than a hundred literary reviews) might be\r\nwritten by one like yourself, and without very great labour. I know it\r\nis highly probable that you may not have leisure, or not care for, or\r\ndislike the subject, but I trust to your kindness to forgive me for\r\nmaking this suggestion. If by any extraordinary good fortune you were\r\ninclined to take up this notion, I would ask you to read my Chapter X.\r\non Geological Succession. And I should like in this case to be permitted\r\nto send you a copy of the new edition, just published, in which I have\r\nadded and corrected somewhat in Chapters IX. and X.\r\n\r\nPray excuse this long letter, and believe me, My dear Sir, yours very\r\nfaithfully, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I write so bad a hand that I have had this note copied.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO THOMAS DAVIDSON. Down, April 30, 1861.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you warmly for your letter; I did not in the least know that you\r\nhad attended to my work. I assure you that the attention which you have\r\npaid to it, considering your knowledge and the philosophical tone of\r\nyour mind (for I well remember one remarkable letter you wrote to me,\r\nand have looked through your various publications), I consider one\r\nof the highest, perhaps the very highest, compliments which I have\r\nreceived. I live so solitary a life that I do not often hear what goes\r\non, and I should much like to know in what work you have published some\r\nremarks on my book. I take a deep interest in the subject, and I hope\r\nnot simply an egotistical interest; therefore you may believe how much\r\nyour letter has gratified me; I am perfectly contented if any one\r\nwill fairly consider the subject, whether or not he fully or only\r\nvery slightly agrees with me. Pray do not think that I feel the least\r\nsurprise at your demurring to a ready acceptance; in fact, I should\r\nnot much respect anyone's judgment who did so: that is, if I may judge\r\nothers from the long time which it has taken me to go round. Each stage\r\nof belief cost me years. The difficulties are, as you say, many and very\r\ngreat; but the more I reflect, the more they seem to me to be due to our\r\nunderestimating our ignorance. I belong so much to old times that I find\r\nthat I weigh the difficulties from the imperfection of the geological\r\nrecord, heavier than some of the younger men. I find, to my astonishment\r\nand joy, that such good men as Ramsay, Jukes, Geikie, and one old\r\nworker, Lyell, do not think that I have in the least exaggerated the\r\nimperfection of the record. (Professor Sedgwick treated this part of the\r\n'Origin of Species' very differently, as might have been expected from\r\nhis vehement objection to Evolution in general. In the article in the\r\n\"Spectator\" of March 24, 1860, already noticed, Sedgwick wrote: \"We know\r\nthe complicated organic phenomena of the Mesozoic (or Oolitic) period.\r\nIt defies the transmutationist at every step. Oh! but the document, says\r\nDarwin, is a fragment; I will interpolate long periods to account for\r\nall the changes. I say, in reply, if you deny my conclusion, grounded\r\non positive evidence, I toss back your conclusion, derived from negative\r\nevidence,--the inflated cushion on which you try to bolster up the\r\ndefects of your hypothesis.\" [The punctuation of the imaginary dialogue\r\nis slightly altered from the original, which is obscure in one place.])\r\nIf my views ever are proved true, our current geological views will have\r\nto be considerably modified. My greatest trouble is, not being able\r\nto weigh the direct effects of the long-continued action of changed\r\nconditions of life without any selection, with the action of selection\r\non mere accidental (so to speak) variability. I oscillate much on this\r\nhead, but generally return to my belief that the direct action of the\r\nconditions of life has not been great. At least this direct action can\r\nhave played an extremely small part in producing all the numberless\r\nand beautiful adaptations in every living creature. With respect to\r\na person's belief, what does rather surprise me is that any one (like\r\nCarpenter) should be willing TO GO SO VERY FAR as to believe that all\r\nbirds may have descended from one parent, and not go a little farther\r\nand include all the members of the same great division; for on such a\r\nscale of belief, all the facts in Morphology and in Embryology (the\r\nmost important in my opinion of all subjects) become mere Divine\r\nmockeries... I cannot express how profoundly glad I am that some day you\r\nwill publish your theoretical view on the modification and endurance of\r\nBrachiopodous species; I am sure it will be a most valuable contribution\r\nto knowledge.\r\n\r\nPray forgive this very egotistical letter, but you yourself are partly\r\nto blame for having pleased me so much. I have told Murray to send a\r\ncopy of my new edition to you, and have written your name.\r\n\r\nWith cordial thanks, pray believe me, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In Mr. Davidson's Monograph on British Brachiopoda, published shortly\r\nafterwards by the Palaeontographical Society, results such as my father\r\nanticipated were to some extent obtained. \"No less than fifteen commonly\r\nreceived species are demonstrated by Mr. Davidson by the aid of a\r\nlong series of transitional forms to appertain to... one type.\" \"Lyell,\r\n'Antiquity of Man,' first edition, page 428.)\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1860, and the early part of 1861, my father had a good\r\ndeal of correspondence with Professor Asa Gray on a subject to which\r\nreference has already been made--the publication in the form of a\r\npamphlet, of Professor Gray's three articles in the July, August,\r\nand October numbers of the 'Atlantic Monthly,' 1860. The pamphlet was\r\npublished by Messrs. Trubner, with reference to whom my father wrote,\r\n\"Messrs. Trubner have been most liberal and kind, and say they shall\r\nmake no charge for all their trouble. I have settled about a few\r\nadvertisements, and they will gratuitously insert one in their own\r\nperiodicals.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will find these articles republished in Dr. Gray's\r\n'Darwiniana,' page 87, under the title \"Natural Selection not\r\ninconsistent with Natural Theology.\" The pamphlet found many admirers\r\namong those most capable of judging of its merits, and my father\r\nbelieved that it was of much value in lessening opposition, and making\r\nconverts to Evolution. His high opinion of it is shown not only in his\r\nletters, but by the fact that he inserted a special notice of it in a\r\nmost prominent place in the third edition of the 'Origin.' Lyell, among\r\nothers, recognised its value as an antidote to the kind of criticism\r\nfrom which the cause of Evolution suffered. Thus my father wrote to Dr.\r\nGray:--\"Just to exemplify the use of your pamphlet, the Bishop of London\r\nwas asking Lyell what he thought of the review in the 'Quarterly,' and\r\nLyell answered, 'Read Asa Gray in the 'Atlantic.'\". It comes out very\r\nclearly that in the case of such publications as Dr. Gray's, my father\r\ndid not rejoice over the success of his special view of Evolution, viz.\r\nthat modification is mainly due to Natural Selection; on the contrary,\r\nhe felt strongly that the really important point was that the doctrine\r\nof Descent should be accepted. Thus he wrote to Professor Gray (May 11,\r\n1863), with reference to Lyell's 'Antiquity of Man':--\r\n\r\n\"You speak of Lyell as a judge; now what I complain of is that he\r\ndeclines to be a judge... I have sometimes almost wished that Lyell had\r\npronounced against me. When I say 'me,' I only mean CHANGE OF SPECIES\r\nBY DESCENT. That seems to me the turning-point. Personally, of course,\r\nI care much about Natural Selection; but that seems to me utterly\r\nunimportant, compared to the question of Creation OR Modification.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, April 11 [1861].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI was very glad to get your photograph: I am expecting mine, which I\r\nwill send off as soon as it comes. It is an ugly affair, and I fear the\r\nfault does not lie with the photographer... Since writing last, I have\r\nhad several letters full of the highest commendation of your Essay; all\r\nagree that it is by far the best thing written, and I do not doubt it\r\nhas done the 'Origin' much good. I have not yet heard how it has sold.\r\nYou will have seen a review in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\". Poor dear\r\nHenslow, to whom I owe much, is dying, and Hooker is with him. Many\r\nthanks for two sets of sheets of your Proceedings. I cannot understand\r\nwhat Agassiz is driving at. You once spoke, I think, of Professor Bowen\r\nas a very clever man. I should have thought him a singularly unobservant\r\nman from his writings. He never can have seen much of animals, or he\r\nwould have seen the difference of old and wise dogs and young ones.\r\nHis paper about hereditariness beats everything. Tell a breeder that\r\nhe might pick out his worst INDIVIDUAL animals and breed from them, and\r\nhope to win a prize, and he would think you... insane.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Professor Henslow died on May 16, 1861, from a complication of\r\nbronchitis, congestion of the lungs, and enlargement of the heart. His\r\nstrong constitution was slow in giving way, and he lingered for weeks\r\nin a painful condition of weakness, knowing that his end was near,\r\nand looking at death with fearless eyes. In Mr. Blomefield's (Jenyns)\r\n'Memoir of Henslow' (1862) is a dignified and touching description\r\nof Prof. Sedgwick's farewell visit to his old friend. Sedgwick said\r\nafterwards that he had never seen \"a human being whose soul was nearer\r\nheaven.\"\r\n\r\nMy father wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker on hearing of Henslow's death, \"I\r\nfully believe a better man never walked this earth.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave his impressions of Henslow's character in Mr. Blomefield's\r\n'Memoir.' In reference to these recollections he wrote to Sir J.D.\r\nHooker (May 30, 1861):--\r\n\r\n\"This morning I wrote my recollections and impressions of character\r\nof poor dear Henslow about the year 1830. I liked the job, and so have\r\nwritten four or five pages, now being copied. I do not suppose you will\r\nuse all, of course you can chop and change as much as you like. If more\r\nthan a sentence is used, I should like to see a proof-page, as I never\r\ncan write decently till I see it in print. Very likely some of my\r\nremarks may appear too trifling, but I thought it best to give my\r\nthoughts as they arose, for you or Jenyns to use as you think fit.\r\n\r\n\"You will see that I have exceeded your request, but, as I said when\r\nI began, I took pleasure in writing my impression of his admirable\r\ncharacter.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, June 5 [1861].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI have been rather extra busy, so have been slack in answering your note\r\nof May 6th. I hope you have received long ago the third edition of the\r\n'Origin.'... I have heard nothing from Trubner of the sale of your Essay,\r\nhence fear it has not been great; I wrote to say you could supply\r\nmore. I send a copy to Sir J. Herschel, and in his new edition of his\r\n'Physical Geography' he has a note on the 'Origin of Species,'\r\nand agrees, to a certain limited extent, but puts in a caution on\r\ndesign--much like yours... I have been led to think more on this subject\r\nof late, and grieve to say that I come to differ more from you. It is\r\nnot that designed variation makes, as it seems to me, my deity \"Natural\r\nSelection\" superfluous, but rather from studying, lately, domestic\r\nvariation, and seeing what an enormous field of undesigned variability\r\nthere is ready for natural selection to appropriate for any purpose\r\nuseful to each creature.\r\n\r\nI thank you much for sending me your review of Phillips. ('Life on the\r\nEarth,' 1860.) I remember once telling you a lot of trades which you\r\nought to have followed, but now I am convinced that you are a born\r\nreviewer. By Jove, how well and often you hit the nail on the head! You\r\nrank Phillips's book higher than I do, or than Lyell does, who thinks it\r\nfearfully retrograde. I amused myself by parodying Phillips's argument\r\nas applied to domestic variation; and you might thus prove that the\r\nduck or pigeon has not varied because the goose has not, though more\r\nanciently domesticated, and no good reason can be assigned why it has\r\nnot produced many varieties ...\r\n\r\nI never knew the newspapers so profoundly interesting. North America\r\ndoes not do England justice; I have not seen or heard of a soul who is\r\nnot with the North. Some few, and I am one of them, even wish to God,\r\nthough at the loss of millions of lives, that the North would proclaim a\r\ncrusade against slavery. In the long-run, a million horrid deaths would\r\nbe amply repaid in the cause of humanity. What wonderful times we live\r\nin! Massachusetts seems to show noble enthusiasm. Great God! How I\r\nshould like to see the greatest curse on earth--slavery--abolished!\r\n\r\nFarewell. Hooker has been absorbed with poor dear revered Henslow's\r\naffairs. Farewell.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGH FALCONER TO CHARLES DARWIN. 31 Sackville St., W., June 23, 1861.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI have been to Adelsberg cave and brought back with me a live Proteus\r\nanguinus, designed for you from the moment I got it; i.e. if you have\r\ngot an aquarium and would care to have it. I only returned last night\r\nfrom the continent, and hearing from your brother that you are about\r\nto go to Torquay, I lose no time in making you the offer. The poor\r\ndear animal is still alive--although it has had no appreciable means\r\nof sustenance for a month--and I am most anxious to get rid of the\r\nresponsibility of starving it longer. In your hands it will thrive and\r\nhave a fair chance of being developed without delay into some type of\r\nthe Columbidae--say a Pouter or a Tumbler.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin, I have been rambling through the north of Italy, and\r\nGermany lately. Everywhere have I heard your views and your admirable\r\nessay canvassed--the views of course often dissented from, according to\r\nthe special bias of the speaker--but the work, its honesty of purpose,\r\ngrandeur of conception, felicity of illustration, and courageous\r\nexposition, always referred to in terms of the highest admiration. And\r\namong your warmest friends no one rejoiced more heartily in the just\r\nappreciation of Charles Darwin than did\r\n\r\nYours very truly, H. FALCONER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO HUGH FALCONER. Down [June 24, 1861].\r\n\r\nMy dear Falconer,\r\n\r\nI have just received your note, and by good luck a day earlier than\r\nproperly, and I lose not a moment in answering you, and thanking you\r\nheartily for your offer of the valuable specimen; but I have no aquarium\r\nand shall soon start for Torquay, so that it would be a thousand pities\r\nthat I should have it. Yet I should certainly much like to see it, but\r\nI fear it is impossible. Would not the Zoological Society be the best\r\nplace? and then the interest which many would take in this extraordinary\r\nanimal would repay you for your trouble.\r\n\r\nKind as you have been in taking this trouble and offering me this\r\nspecimen, to tell the truth I value your note more than the specimen. I\r\nshall keep your note amongst a very few precious letters. Your kindness\r\nhas quite touched me.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately and gratefully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. 2 Hesketh Crescent, Torquay, July 13\r\n[1861].\r\n\r\n... I hope Harvey is better; I got his review (The 'Dublin Hospital\r\nGazette,' May 15, 1861. The passage referred to is at page 150.) of me\r\na day or two ago, from which I infer he must be convalescent; it's very\r\ngood and fair; but it is funny to see a man argue on the succession\r\nof animals from Noah's Deluge; as God did not then wholly destroy man,\r\nprobably he did not wholly destroy the races of other animals at each\r\ngeological period! I never expected to have a helping hand from the Old\r\nTestament...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. 2, Hesketh Crescent, Torquay, July 20\r\n[1861].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI sent you two or three days ago a duplicate of a good review of the\r\n'Origin' by a Mr. Maw (Mr. George Maw, of Benthall Hall. The review was\r\npublished in the 'Zoologist,' July, 1861. On the back of my father's\r\ncopy is written, \"Must be consulted before new edit. of 'Origin'\"--words\r\nwhich are wanting on many more pretentious notices, on which frequently\r\noccur my father's brief o/-, or \"nothing new.\"), evidently a thoughtful\r\nman, as I thought you might like to have it, as you have so many...\r\n\r\nThis is quite a charming place, and I have actually walked, I believe,\r\ngood two miles out and back, which is a grand feat.\r\n\r\nI saw Mr. Pengelly (William Pengelly, the geologist, and well-known\r\nexplorer of the Devonshire caves.) the other day, and was pleased at his\r\nenthusiasm. I do not in the least know whether you are in London. Your\r\nillness must have lost you much time, but I hope you have nearly got\r\nyour great job of the new edition finished. You must be very busy, if\r\nin London, so I will be generous, and on honour bright do not expect any\r\nanswer to this dull little note...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, September 17 [1861?].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your very long and interesting letter,\r\npolitical and scientific, of August 27th and 29th, and September 2nd\r\nreceived this morning. I agree with much of what you say, and I hope\r\nto God we English are utterly wrong in doubting (1) whether the N. can\r\nconquer the S.; (2) whether the N. has many friends in the South, and\r\n(3) whether you noble men of Massachusetts are right in transferring\r\nyour own good feelings to the men of Washington. Again I say I hope to\r\nGod we are wrong in doubting on these points. It is number (3) which\r\nalone causes England not to be enthusiastic with you. What it may be in\r\nLancashire I know not, but in S. England cotton has nothing whatever\r\nto do with our doubts. If abolition does follow with your victory, the\r\nwhole world will look brighter in my eyes, and in many eyes. It would be\r\na great gain even to stop the spread of slavery into the Territories;\r\nif that be possible without abolition, which I should have doubted. You\r\nought not to wonder so much at England's coldness, when you recollect\r\nat the commencement of the war how many propositions were made to get\r\nthings back to the old state with the old line of latitude, but enough\r\nof this, all I can say is that Massachusetts and the adjoining States\r\nhave the full sympathy of every good man whom I see; and this sympathy\r\nwould be extended to the whole Federal States, if we could be persuaded\r\nthat your feelings were at all common to them. But enough of this. It\r\nis out of my line, though I read every word of news, and formerly well\r\nstudied Olmsted...\r\n\r\nYour question what would convince me of Design is a poser. If I saw an\r\nangel come down to teach us good, and I was convinced from others\r\nseeing him that I was not mad, I should believe in design. If I could be\r\nconvinced thoroughly that life and mind was in an unknown way a function\r\nof other imponderable force, I should be convinced. If man was made of\r\nbrass or iron and no way connected with any other organism which had\r\never lived, I should perhaps be convinced. But this is childish writing.\r\n\r\nI have lately been corresponding with Lyell, who, I think, adopts your\r\nidea of the stream of variation having been led or designed. I have\r\nasked him (and he says he will hereafter reflect and answer me) whether\r\nhe believes that the shape of my nose was designed. If he does I have\r\nnothing more to say. If not, seeing what Fanciers have done by selecting\r\nindividual differences in the nasal bones of pigeons, I must think that\r\nit is illogical to suppose that the variations, which natural selection\r\npreserves for the good of any being have been designed. But I know that\r\nI am in the same sort of muddle (as I have said before) as all the world\r\nseems to be in with respect to free will, yet with everything supposed\r\nto have been foreseen or pre-ordained.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my dear Gray, with many thanks for your interesting letter.\r\n\r\nYour unmerciful correspondent. C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO H.W. BATES. Down, December 3 [1861].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you for your extremely interesting letter, and valuable\r\nreferences, though God knows when I shall come again to this part of\r\nmy subject. One cannot of course judge of style when one merely hears\r\na paper (On Mimetic Butterflies, read before the Linnean Soc., November\r\n21, 1861. For my father's opinion of it when published, see below.), but\r\nyours seemed to me very clear and good. Believe me that I estimate its\r\nvalue most highly. Under a general point of view, I am quite convinced\r\n(Hooker and Huxley took the same view some months ago) that a\r\nphilosophic view of nature can solely be driven into naturalists by\r\ntreating special subjects as you have done. Under a special point of\r\nview, I think you have solved one of the most perplexing problems which\r\ncould be given to solve. I am glad to hear from Hooker that the Linnean\r\nSociety will give plates if you can get drawings...\r\n\r\nDo not complain of want of advice during your travels; I dare say\r\npart of your great originality of views may be due to the necessity of\r\nsel-exertion of thought. I can understand that your reception at the\r\nBritish Museum would damp you; they are a very good set of men, but not\r\nthe sort to appreciate your work. In fact I have long thought that TOO\r\nMUCH systematic work [and] description somehow blunts the faculties. The\r\ngeneral public appreciates a good dose of reasoning, or generalisation,\r\nwith new and curious remarks on habits, final causes, etc. etc., far\r\nmore than do the regular naturalists.\r\n\r\nI am extremely glad to hear that you have begun your travels... I am very\r\nbusy, but I shall be TRULY glad to render any aid which I can by reading\r\nyour first chapter or two. I do not think I shall be able to correct\r\nstyle, for this reason, that after repeated trials I find I cannot\r\ncorrect my own style till I see the MS. in type. Some are born with a\r\npower of good writing, like Wallace; others like myself and Lyell have\r\nto labour very hard and slowly at every sentence. I find it a very good\r\nplan, when I cannot get a difficult discussion to please me, to fancy\r\nthat some one comes into the room and asks me what I am doing; and then\r\ntry at once and explain to the imaginary person what it is all about. I\r\nhave done this for one paragraph to myself several times, and sometimes\r\nto Mrs. Darwin, till I see how the subject ought to go. It is, I think,\r\ngood to read one's MS. aloud. But style to me is a great difficulty;\r\nyet some good judges think I have succeeded, and I say this to encourage\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nWhat I THINK I can do will be to tell you whether parts had better be\r\nshortened. It is good, I think, to dash \"in media res,\" and work in\r\nlater any descriptions of country or any historical details which may\r\nbe necessary. Murray likes lots of wood-cuts--give some by all means\r\nof ants. The public appreciate monkeys--our poor cousins. What sexual\r\ndifferences are there in monkeys? Have you kept them tame? if so, about\r\ntheir expression. I fear that you will hardly read my vile hand-writing,\r\nbut I cannot without killing trouble write better.\r\n\r\nYou shall have my candid opinion on your MS., but remember it is hard to\r\njudge from MS., one reads slowly, and heavy parts seem much heavier. A\r\nfirst-rate judge thought my Journal very poor; now that it is in print,\r\nI happen to know, he likes it. I am sure you will understand why I am so\r\negotistical.\r\n\r\nI was a LITTLE disappointed in Wallace's book ('Travels on the Amazon\r\nand Rio Negro,' 1853.) on the Amazon; hardly facts enough. On the other\r\nhand, in Gosse's book (Probably the 'Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica,'\r\n1851.) there is not reasoning enough to my taste. Heaven knows whether\r\nyou will care to read all this scribbling...\r\n\r\nI am glad you had a pleasant day with Hooker (In a letter to Sir J.D.\r\nHooker (December 1861), my father wrote: \"I am very glad to hear that\r\nyou like Bates. I have seldom in my life been more struck with a man's\r\npower of mind.\"), he is an admirably good man in every sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following extract from a letter to Mr. Bates on the same subject\r\nis interesting as giving an idea of the plan followed by my father in\r\nwriting his 'Naturalist's Voyage:'\r\n\r\n\"As an old hackneyed author, let me give you a bit of advice, viz.\r\nto strike out every word which is not quite necessary to the current\r\nsubject, and which could not interest a stranger. I constantly asked\r\nmyself, would a stranger care for this? and struck out or left in\r\naccordingly. I think too much pains cannot be taken in making the style\r\ntransparently clear and throwing eloquence to the dogs.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bates's book, 'The Naturalist on the Amazons,' was published in\r\n1865, but the following letter may be given here rather than in its due\r\nchronological position:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO H.W. BATES. Down, April 18, 1863.\r\n\r\nDear Bates,\r\n\r\nI have finished volume i. My criticisms may be condensed into a single\r\nsentence, namely, that it is the best work of Natural History Travels\r\never published in England. Your style seems to me admirable. Nothing can\r\nbe better than the discussion on the struggle for existence, and nothing\r\nbetter than the description of the Forest scenery. (In a letter to Lyell\r\nmy father wrote: \"He [i.e. Mr. Bates] is second only to Humboldt in\r\ndescribing a tropical forest.\") It is a grand book, and whether or not\r\nit sells quickly, it will last. You have spoken out boldly on\r\nSpecies; and boldness on the subject seems to get rarer and rarer. How\r\nbeautifully illustrated it is. The cut on the back is most tasteful. I\r\nheartily congratulate you on its publication.\r\n\r\nThe \"Athenaeum\" (\"I have read the first volume of Bates's Book; it is\r\ncapital, and I think the best Natural History Travels ever published in\r\nEngland. He is bold about Species, etc., and the \"Athenaeum\" coolly\r\nsays 'he bends his facts' for this purpose.\"--(From a letter to Sir J.D.\r\nHooker.)) was rather cold, as it always is, and insolent in the highest\r\ndegree about your leading facts. Have you seen the \"Reader\"? I can send\r\nit to you if you have not seen it...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, December 11 [1861].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nMany and cordial thanks for your two last most valuable notes. What a\r\nthing it is that when you receive this we may be at war, and we two be\r\nbound, as good patriots, to hate each other, though I shall find this\r\nhating you very hard work. How curious it is to see two countries, just\r\nlike two angry and silly men, taking so opposite a view of the same\r\ntransaction! I fear there is no shadow of doubt we shall fight if the\r\ntwo Southern rogues are not given up. (The Confederate Commissioners\r\nSlidell and Mason were forcibly removed from the \"Trent\", a West India\r\nmail steamer on November 8, 1861. The news that the U.S. agreed to\r\nrelease them reached England on January 8, 1862.) And what a wretched\r\nthing it will be if we fight on the side of slavery. No doubt it will be\r\nsaid that we fight to get cotton; but I fully believe that this has not\r\nentered into the motive in the least. Well, thank Heaven, we private\r\nindividuals have nothing to do with so awful a responsibility. Again,\r\nhow curious it is that you seem to think that you can conquer the South;\r\nand I never meet a soul, even those who would most wish it, who thinks\r\nit possible--that is, to conquer and retain it. I do not suppose the\r\nmass of people in your country will believe it, but I feel sure if we\r\ndo go to war it will be with the utmost reluctance by all classes,\r\nMinisters of Government and all. Time will show, and it is no use\r\nwriting or thinking about it. I called the other day on Dr. Boott, and\r\nwas pleased to find him pretty well and cheerful. I see, by the way, he\r\ntakes quite an English opinion of American affairs, though an American\r\nin heart. (Dr. Boott was born in the U.S.) Buckle might write a chapter\r\non opinion being entirely dependent on longitude!\r\n\r\n... With respect to Design, I feel more inclined to show a white flag\r\nthan to fire my usual long-range shot. I like to try and ask you a\r\npuzzling question, but when you return the compliment I have great\r\ndoubts whether it is a fair way of arguing. If anything is designed,\r\ncertainly man must be: one's \"inner consciousness\" (though a false\r\nguide) tells one so; yet I cannot admit that man's rudimentary\r\nmammae... were designed. If I was to say I believed this, I should\r\nbelieve it in the same incredible manner as the orthodox believe the\r\nTrinity in Unity. You say that you are in a haze; I am in thick mud; the\r\northodox would say in fetid, abominable mud; yet I cannot keep out of\r\nthe question. My dear Gray, I have written a deal of nonsense.\r\n\r\nYours most cordially, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1862.\r\n\r\n[Owing to the illness from scarlet fever of one of his boys, he took\r\na house at Bournemouth in the autumn. He wrote to Dr. Gray from\r\nSouthampton (August 21, 1862):--\r\n\r\n\"We are a wretched family, and ought to be exterminated. We slept here\r\nto rest our poor boy on his journey to Bournemouth, and my poor dear\r\nwife sickened with scarlet fever, and has had it pretty sharply, but is\r\nrecovering well. There is no end of trouble in this weary world. I shall\r\nnot feel safe till we are all at home together, and when that will be I\r\nknow not. But it is foolish complaining.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Gray used to send postage stamps to the scarlet fever patient; with\r\nregard to this good-natured deed my father wrote--\r\n\r\n\"I must just recur to stamps; my little man has calculated that he\r\nwill now have 6 stamps which no other boy in the school has. Here is a\r\ntriumph. Your last letter was plaistered with many coloured stamps, and\r\nhe long surveyed the envelope in bed with much quiet satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the letters of 1862 deal with the Orchid work, but\r\nthe wave of conversion to Evolution was still spreading, and reviews and\r\nletters bearing on the subject still came in numbers. As an example\r\nof the odd letters he received may be mentioned one which arrived in\r\nJanuary of this year \"from a German homoeopathic doctor, an ardent\r\nadmirer of the 'Origin.' Had himself published nearly the same sort of\r\nbook, but goes much deeper. Explains the origin of plants and animals on\r\nthe principles of homoeopathy or by the law of spirality. Book fell dead\r\nin Germany. Therefore would I translate it and publish it in England.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, [January?] 14 [1862].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nI am heartily glad of your success in the North (This refers to two of\r\nMr. Huxley's lectures, given before the Philosophical Institution of\r\nEdinburgh in 1862. The substance of them is given in 'Man's Place\r\nin Nature.'), and thank you for your note and slip. By Jove you have\r\nattacked Bigotry in its stronghold. I thought you would have been\r\nmobbed. I am so glad that you will publish your Lectures. You seem\r\nto have kept a due medium between extreme boldness and caution. I am\r\nheartily glad that all went off so well. I hope Mrs. Huxley is pretty\r\nwell... I must say one word on the Hybrid question. No doubt you are\r\nright that here is a great hiatus in the argument; yet I think you\r\noverrate it--you never allude to the excellent evidence of VARIETIES of\r\nVerbascum and Nicotiana being partially sterile together. It is curious\r\nto me to read (as I have to-day) the greatest crossing GARDENER utterly\r\npooh-poohing the distinction which BOTANISTS make on this head, and\r\ninsisting how frequently crossed VARIETIES produce sterile offspring. Do\r\noblige me by reading the latter half of my Primula paper in the 'Linn.\r\nJournal,' for it leads me to suspect that sterility will hereafter have\r\nto be largely viewed as an acquired or SELECTED character--a view which\r\nI wish I had had facts to maintain in the 'Origin.' (The view here given\r\nwill be discussed in the chapter on hetero-styled plants.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 25 [1862].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your last Sunday's letter, which was one of the\r\npleasantest I ever received in my life. We are all pretty well\r\nredivivus, and I am at work again. I thought it best to make a clean\r\nbreast to Asa Gray; and told him that the Boston dinner, etc. etc., had\r\nquite turned my stomach, and that I almost thought it would be good for\r\nthe peace of the world if the United States were split up; on the\r\nother hand, I said that I groaned to think of the slave-holders being\r\ntriumphant, and that the difficulties of making a line of separation\r\nwere fearful. I wonder what he will say... Your notion of the Aristocrat\r\nbeing kenspeckle, and the best men of a good lot being thus easily\r\nselected is new to me, and striking. The 'Origin' having made you in\r\nfact a jolly old Tory, made us all laugh heartily. I have sometimes\r\nspeculated on this subject; primogeniture (My father had a strong\r\nfeeling as to the injustice of primogeniture, and in a similar spirit\r\nwas often indignant over the unfair wills that appear from time to time.\r\nHe would declare energetically that if he were law-giver no will should\r\nbe valid that was not published in the testator's lifetime; and this he\r\nmaintained would prevent much of the monstrous injustice and meanness\r\napparent in so many wills.) is dreadfully opposed to selection; suppose\r\nthe first-born bull was necessarily made by each farmer the begetter\r\nof his stock! On the other hand, as you say, ablest men are continually\r\nraised to the peerage, and get crossed with the older Lord-breeds, and\r\nthe Lords continually select the most beautiful and charming women out\r\nof the lower ranks; so that a good deal of indirect selection improves\r\nthe Lords. Certainly I agree with you the present American row has\r\na very Torifying influence on us all. I am very glad to hear you are\r\nbeginning to print the 'Genera;' it is a wonderful satisfaction to be\r\nthus brought to bed, indeed it is one's chief satisfaction, I think,\r\nthough one knows that another bantling will soon be developing...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MAXWELL MASTERS. (Dr. Masters is a well-known\r\nvegetable teratologist, and has been for many years the editor of the\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle\".) Down, February 26 [1862].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am much obliged to you for sending me your article (Refers to a paper\r\non \"Vegetable Morphology,\" by Dr. Masters, in the 'British and Foreign\r\nMedic-Chirurgical Review' for 1862), which I have just read with much\r\ninterest. The history, and a good deal besides, was quite new to me. It\r\nseems to me capitally done, and so clearly written. You really ought to\r\nwrite your larger work. You speak too generously of my book; but I must\r\nconfess that you have pleased me not a little; for no one, as far as I\r\nknow, has ever remarked on what I say on classification--a part, which\r\nwhen I wrote it, pleased me. With many thanks to you for sending me your\r\narticle, pray believe me,\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, yours sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the spring of this year (1862) my father read the second volume of\r\nBuckle's 'History of Civilisation.\" The following strongly expressed\r\nopinion about it may be worth quoting:--\r\n\r\n\"Have you read Buckle's second volume? It has interested me greatly;\r\nI do not care whether his views are right or wrong, but I should think\r\nthey contained much truth. There is a noble love of advancement and\r\ntruth throughout; and to my taste he is the very best writer of the\r\nEnglish language that ever lived, let the other be who he may.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, March 15 [1862].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nThanks for the newspapers (though they did contain digs at England),\r\nand for your note of February 18th. It is really almost a pleasure to\r\nreceive stabs from so smooth, polished, and sharp a dagger as your\r\npen. I heartily wish I could sympathise more fully with you, instead of\r\nmerely hating the South. We cannot enter into your feelings; if Scotland\r\nwere to rebel, I presume we should be very wrath, but I do not think we\r\nshould care a penny what other nations thought. The millennium must come\r\nbefore nations love each other; but try and do not hate me. Think of me,\r\nif you will as a poor blinded fool. I fear the dreadful state of affairs\r\nmust dull your interest in Science...\r\n\r\nI believe that your pamphlet has done my book GREAT good; and I thank\r\nyou from my heart for myself; and believing that the views are in large\r\npart true, I must think that you have done natural science a good turn.\r\nNatural Selection seems to be making a little progress in England and\r\non the Continent; a new German edition is called for, and a French (In\r\nJune, 1862, my father wrote to Dr. Gray: \"I received, 2 or 3 days ago, a\r\nFrench translation of the 'Origin,' by a Madlle. Royer, who must be one\r\nof the cleverest and oddest women in Europe: is an ardent Deist, and\r\nhates Christianity, and declares that natural selection and the struggle\r\nfor life will explain all morality, nature of man, politics, etc. etc.!\r\nShe makes some very curious and good hits, and says she shall publish\r\na book on these subjects.\" Madlle. Royer added foot-notes to her\r\ntranslation, and in many places where the author expresses great doubt,\r\nshe explains the difficulty, or points out that no real difficulty\r\nexists.) one has just appeared. One of the best men, though at present\r\nunknown, who has taken up these views, is Mr. Bates; pray read his\r\n'Travels in Amazonia,' when they appear; they will be very good, judging\r\nfrom MS. of the first two chapters.\r\n\r\n... Again I say, do not hate me.\r\n\r\nEver yours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. 1 Carlton Terrace, Southampton (The house of\r\nhis son William.), August 22, [1862].\r\n\r\n... I heartily hope that you (I.e. 'The Antiquity of Man.') will be out\r\nin October... you say that the Bishop and Owen will be down on you; the\r\nlatter hardly can, for I was assured that Owen in his Lectures this\r\nspring advanced as a new idea that wingless birds had lost their wings\r\nby disuse, also that magpies stole spoons, etc., from a REMNANT of\r\nsome instinct like that of the Bower-Bird, which ornaments its\r\nplaying-passage with pretty feathers. Indeed, I am told that he hinted\r\nplainly that all birds are descended from one...\r\n\r\nYour P.S. touches on, as it seems to me, very difficult points. I am\r\nglad to see [that] in the 'Origin,' I only say that the naturalists\r\ngenerally consider that low organisms vary more than high; and this I\r\nthink certainly is the general opinion. I put the statement this way to\r\nshow that I considered it only an opinion probably true. I must own that\r\nI do not at all trust even Hooker's contrary opinion, as I feel pretty\r\nsure that he has not tabulated any result. I have some materials at\r\nhome, I think I attempted to make this point out, but cannot remember\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nMere variability, though the necessary foundation of all modifications,\r\nI believe to be almost always present, enough to allow of any amount of\r\nselected change; so that it does not seem to me at all incompatible\r\nthat a group which at any one period (or during all successive periods)\r\nvaries less, should in the long course of time have undergone more\r\nmodification than a group which is generally more variable.\r\n\r\nPlacental animals, e.g. might be at each period less variable than\r\nMarsupials, and nevertheless have undergone more DIFFERENTIATION and\r\ndevelopment than marsupials, owing to some advantage, probably brain\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nI am surprised, but do not pretend to form an opinion at Hooker's\r\nstatement that higher species, genera, etc., are best limited. It seems\r\nto me a bold statement.\r\n\r\nLooking to the 'Origin,' I see that I state that the productions of the\r\nland seem to change quicker than those of the sea (Chapter X., page 339,\r\n3d edition), and I add there is some reason to believe that organisms\r\nconsidered high in the scale change quicker than those that are low. I\r\nremember writing these sentences after much deliberation... I remember\r\nwell feeling much hesitation about putting in even the guarded sentences\r\nwhich I did. My doubts, I remember, related to the rate of change of\r\nthe Radiata in the Secondary formation, and of the Foraminifera in the\r\noldest Tertiary beds...\r\n\r\nGood night, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, October 1 [1862].\r\n\r\n... I found here (On his return from Bournemouth.) a short and very kind\r\nnote of Falconer, with some pages of his 'Elephant Memoir,' which will\r\nbe published, in which he treats admirably on long persistence of type.\r\nI thought he was going to make a good and crushing attack on me, but\r\nto my great satisfaction, he ends by pointing out a loophole, and\r\nadds (Falconer, \"On the American Fossil Elephant,\" in the 'Nat. Hist.\r\nReview,' 1863, page 81. The words preceding those cited by my father\r\nmake the meaning of his quotation clearer. The passage begins as\r\nfollows: \"The inferences which I draw from these facts are not opposed\r\nto one of the leading propositions of Darwin's theory. With him,\" etc.\r\netc.) \"with him I have no faith that the mammoth and other extinct\r\nelephants made their appearance suddenly... The most rational view seems\r\nto be that they are the modified descendants of earlier progenitors,\r\netc.\" This is capital. There will not be soon one good palaeontologist\r\nwho believes in immutability. Falconer does not allow for the\r\nProboscidean group being a failing one, and therefore not likely to be\r\ngiving off new races.\r\n\r\nHe adds that he does not think Natural Selection suffices. I do not\r\nquite see the force of his argument, and he apparently overlooks that\r\nI say over and over again that Natural Selection can do nothing without\r\nvariability, and that variability is subject to the most complex fixed\r\nlaws...\r\n\r\n\r\n[In his letters to Sir J.D. Hooker, about the end of this year, are\r\noccasional notes on the progress of the 'Variation of Animals and\r\nPlants.' Thus on November 24th he wrote: \"I hardly know why I am a\r\nlittle sorry, but my present work is leading me to believe rather more\r\nin the direct action of physical conditions. I presume I regret\r\nit, because it lessens the glory of natural selection, and is so\r\nconfoundedly doubtful. Perhaps I shall change again when I get all my\r\nfacts under one point of view, and a pretty hard job this will be.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, on December 22nd, \"To-day I have begun to think of arranging\r\nmy concluding chapters on Inheritance, Reversion, Selection, and such\r\nthings, and am fairly paralyzed how to begin and how to end, and what to\r\ndo, with my huge piles of materials.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, November 6 [1862].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nWhen your note of October 4th and 13th (chiefly about Max Muller)\r\narrived, I was nearly at the end of the same book ('Lectures on the\r\nScience of Language,' 1st edition 1861.), and had intended recommending\r\nyou to read it. I quite agree that it is extremely interesting, but\r\nthe latter part about the FIRST origin of language much the least\r\nsatisfactory. It is a marvellous problem...[There are] covert sneers at\r\nme, which he seems to get the better of towards the close of the book.\r\nI cannot quite see how it will forward \"my cause,\" as you call it; but I\r\ncan see how any one with literary talent (I do not feel up to it) could\r\nmake great use of the subject in illustration. (Language was treated\r\nin the manner here indicated by Sir C. Lyell in the 'Antiquity of\r\nMan.' Also by Prof. Schleicher, whose pamphlet was fully noticed in the\r\n\"Reader\", February 27, 1864 (as I learn from one of Prof. Huxley's 'Lay\r\nSermons').) What pretty metaphors you would make from it! I wish some\r\none would keep a lot of the most noisy monkeys, half free, and study\r\ntheir means of communication!\r\n\r\nA book has just appeared here which will, I suppose, make a noise, by\r\nBishop Colenso ('The Pentateuch and Book of Joshua critically examined,'\r\nsix parts, 1862-71.), who, judging from extracts, smashes most of the\r\nOld testament. Talking of books, I am in the middle of one which pleases\r\nme, though it is very innocent food, viz., Miss Coopers 'Journal of\r\na Naturalist.' Who is she? She seems a very clever woman, and gives a\r\ncapital account of the battle between OUR and YOUR weeds. Does it not\r\nhurt your Yankee pride that we thrash you so confoundedly? I am sure\r\nMrs. Gray will stick up for your own weeds. Ask her whether they are not\r\nmore honest, downright good sort of weeds. The book gives an extremely\r\npretty picture of one of your villages; but I see your autumn, though\r\nso much more gorgeous than ours, comes on sooner, and that is one\r\ncomfort...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO H.W. BATES. Down, November 20 [1862].\r\n\r\nDear Bates,\r\n\r\nI have just finished, after several reads, your paper. (This refers\r\nto Mr. Bates's paper, \"Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazons\r\nValley\" ('Linn. Soc. Trans.' xxiii., 1862), in which the now familiar\r\nsubject of mimicry was founded. My father wrote a short review of it in\r\nthe 'Natural History Review,' 1863, page 219, parts of which occur in\r\nthis review almost verbatim in the later editions of the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies.' A striking passage occurs showing the difficulties of the case\r\nfrom a creationist's point of view:--\r\n\r\n\"By what means, it may be asked, have so many butterflies of the\r\nAmazonian region acquired their deceptive dress? Most naturalists will\r\nanswer that they were thus clothed from the hour of their creation--an\r\nanswer which will generally be so far triumphant that it can be met only\r\nby long-drawn arguments; but it is made at the expense of putting an\r\neffectual bar to all further enquiry. In this particular case, moreover,\r\nthe creationist will meet with special difficulties; for many of the\r\nmimicking forms of Leptalis can be shown by a graduated series to\r\nbe merely varieties of one species; other mimickers are undoubtedly\r\ndistinct species, or even distinct genera. So again, some of the\r\nmimicked forms can be shown to be merely varieties; but the greater\r\nnumber must be ranked as distinct species. Hence the creationist will\r\nhave to admit that some of these forms have become imitators, by means\r\nof the laws of variation, whilst others he must look at as separately\r\ncreated under their present guise; he will further have to admit that\r\nsome have been created in imitation of forms not themselves created\r\nas we now see them, but due to the laws of variation? Prof. Agassiz,\r\nindeed, would think nothing of this difficulty; for he believes that\r\nnot only each species and each variety, but that groups of individuals,\r\nthough identically the same, when inhabiting distinct countries, have\r\nbeen all separately created in due proportional numbers to the wants\r\nof each land. Not many naturalists will be content thus to believe that\r\nvarieties and individuals have been turned out all ready made, almost as\r\na manufacturer turns out toys according to the temporary demand of the\r\nmarket.\") In my opinion it is one of the most remarkable and admirable\r\npapers I ever read in my life. The mimetic cases are truly marvellous,\r\nand you connect excellently a host of analogous facts. The illustrations\r\nare beautiful, and seem very well chosen; but it would have saved the\r\nreader not a little trouble, if the name of each had been engraved below\r\neach separate figure. No doubt this would have put the engraver into\r\nfits, as it would have destroyed the beauty of the plate. I am not at\r\nall surprised at such a paper having consumed much time. I am rejoiced\r\nthat I passed over the whole subject in the 'Origin,' for I should have\r\nmade a precious mess of it. You have most clearly stated and solved a\r\nwonderful problem. No doubt with most people this will be the cream\r\nof the paper; but I am not sure that all your facts and reasonings on\r\nvariation, and on the segregation of complete and semi-complete species,\r\nis not really more, or at least as valuable, a part. I never conceived\r\nthe process nearly so clearly before; one feels present at the creation\r\nof new forms. I wish, however, you had enlarged a little more on the\r\npairing of similar varieties; a rather more numerous body of facts\r\nseems here wanted. Then, again, what a host of curious miscellaneous\r\nobservations there are--as on related sexual and individual variability:\r\nthese will some day, if I live, be a treasure to me.\r\n\r\nWith respect to mimetic resemblance being so common with insects, do you\r\nnot think it may be connected with their small size; they cannot\r\ndefend themselves; they cannot escape by flight, at least, from birds,\r\ntherefore they escape by trickery and deception?\r\n\r\nI have one serious criticism to make, and that is about the title of\r\nthe paper; I cannot but think that you ought to have called prominent\r\nattention in it to the mimetic resemblances. Your paper is too good to\r\nbe largely appreciated by the mob of naturalists without souls;\r\nbut, rely on it, that it will have LASTING value, and I cordially\r\ncongratulate you on your first great work. You will find, I should\r\nthink, that Wallace will fully appreciate it. How gets on your book?\r\nKeep your spirits up. A book is no light labour. I have been better\r\nlately, and working hard, but my health is very indifferent. How is your\r\nhealth? Believe me, dear Bates,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.IV. -- THE SPREAD OF EVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n'VARIATION OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS'\r\n\r\n1863-1866.\r\n\r\n[His book on animals and plants under domestication was my father's\r\nchief employment in the year 1863. His diary records the length of time\r\nspent over the composition of its chapters, and shows the rate at which\r\nhe arranged and wrote out for printing the observations and deductions\r\nof several years.\r\n\r\nThe three chapters in volume ii. on inheritance, which occupy 84 pages\r\nof print, were begun in January and finished on April 1st; the five on\r\ncrossing, making 106 pages, were written in eight weeks, while the two\r\nchapters on selection, covering 57 pages, were begun on June 16th and\r\nfinished on July 20th.\r\n\r\nThe work was more than once interrupted by ill health, and in September,\r\nwhat proved to be the beginning of a six month's illness, forced him\r\nto leave home for the water-cure at Malvern. He returned in October and\r\nremained ill and depressed, in spite of the hopeful opinion of one of\r\nthe most cheery and skilful physicians of the day. Thus he wrote to Sir\r\nJ.D. Hooker in November:--\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Brinton has been here (recommended by Busk); he does not believe my\r\nbrain or heart are primarily affected, but I have been so steadily going\r\ndown hill, I cannot help doubting whether I can ever crawl a little\r\nuphill again. Unless I can, enough to work a little, I hope my life\r\nmay be very short, for to lie on a sofa all day and do nothing but\r\ngive trouble to the best and kindest of wives and good dear children is\r\ndreadful.\"\r\n\r\nThe minor works in this year were a short paper in the 'Natural\r\nHistory Review' (N.S. vol. iii. page 115), entitled \"On the so-called\r\n'Auditor-Sac' of Cirripedes,\" and one in the 'Geological Society's\r\nJournal' (vol. xix), on the \"Thickness of the Pampaean Formation\r\nnear Buenos Ayres.\" The paper on Cirripedes was called forth by\r\nthe criticisms of a German naturalist Krohn (Krohn stated that the\r\nstructures described by my father as ovaries were in reality salivary\r\nglands, also that the oviduct runs down to the orifice described in the\r\n'Monograph of the Cirripedia' as the auditory meatus.), and is of some\r\ninterest in illustration of my father's readiness to admit an error.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the spread of a belief in Evolution, it could not yet be\r\nsaid that the battle was won, but the growth of belief was undoubtedly\r\nrapid. So that, for instance, Charles Kingsley could write to F.D.\r\nMaurice (Kingsley's 'Life,' ii, page 171.):\r\n\r\n\"The state of the scientific mind is most curious; Darwin is conquering\r\neverywhere, and rushing in like a flood, by the mere force of truth and\r\nfact.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Huxley was as usual active in guiding and stimulating the growing\r\ntendency to tolerate or accept the views set forth in the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies.' He gave a series of lectures to working men at the School of\r\nMines in November, 1862. These were printed in 1863 from the shorthand\r\nnotes of Mr. May, as six little blue books, price 4 pence each, under\r\nthe title, 'Our Knowledge of the Causes of Organic Nature.' When\r\npublished they were read with interest by my father, who thus refers to\r\nthem in a letter to Sir J.D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad you like Huxley's lectures. I have been very much\r\nstruck with them, especially with the 'Philosophy of Induction.' I have\r\nquarrelled with him for overdoing sterility and ignoring cases from\r\nGartner and Kolreuter about sterile varieties. His Geology is obscure;\r\nand I rather doubt about man's mind and language. But it seems to\r\nme ADMIRABLY done, and, as you say, \"Oh my,\" about the praise of the\r\n'Origin.' I can't help liking it, which makes me rather ashamed of\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nMy father admired the clearness of exposition shown in the lectures, and\r\nin the following letter urges their author to make use of his powers for\r\nthe advantage of students:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. November 5 [1864].\r\n\r\nI want to make a suggestion to you, but which may probably have occurred\r\nto you. -- was reading your Lectures and ended by saying, \"I wish he\r\nwould write a book.\" I answered, \"he has just written a great book on\r\nthe skull.\" \"I don't call that a book,\" she replied, and added, \"I want\r\nsomething that people can read; he does write so well.\" Now, with your\r\nease in writing, and with knowledge at your fingers' ends, do you not\r\nthink you could write a popular Treatise on Zoology? Of course it would\r\nbe some waste of time, but I have been asked more than a dozen times to\r\nrecommend something for a beginner and could only think of Carpenter's\r\nZoology. I am sure that a striking Treatise would do real service to\r\nscience by educating naturalists. If you were to keep a portfolio open\r\nfor a couple of years, and throw in slips of paper as subjects crossed\r\nyour mind, you would soon have a skeleton (and that seems to me the\r\ndifficulty) on which to put the flesh and colours in your inimitable\r\nmanner. I believe such a book might have a brilliant success, but I did\r\nnot intend to scribble so much about it.\r\n\r\nGive my kindest remembrance to Mrs. Huxley, and tell her I was looking\r\nat 'Enoch Arden,' and as I know how she admires Tennyson, I must call\r\nher attention to two sweetly pretty lines (page 105)...\r\n\r\n... and he meant, he said he meant, Perhaps he meant, or partly meant,\r\nyou well.\r\n\r\nSuch a gem as this is enough to make me young again, and like poetry\r\nwith pristine fervour.\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley, Yours affectionately, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In another letter (January 1865) he returns to the above suggestion,\r\nthough he was in general strongly opposed to men of science giving up to\r\nthe writing of text-books, or to teaching, the time that might otherwise\r\nhave been given to original research.\r\n\r\n\"I knew there was very little chance of your having time to write a\r\npopular Treatise on Zoology, but you are about the one man who could do\r\nit. At the time I felt it would be almost a sin for you to do it, as\r\nit would of course destroy some original work. On the other hand\r\nI sometimes think that general and popular treatises are almost as\r\nimportant for the progress of science as original work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe series of letters will continue the history of the year 1863.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 3 [1863].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI am burning with indignation and must exhale... I could not get to sleep\r\ntill past 3 last night for indignation (It would serve no useful purpose\r\nif I were to go into the matter which so strongly roused my father's\r\nanger. It was a question of literary dishonesty, in which a friend was\r\nthe sufferer, but which in no way affected himself.)...\r\n\r\nNow for pleasanter subjects; we were all amused at your defence of stamp\r\ncollecting and collecting generally... But, by Jove, I can hardly stomach\r\na grown man collecting stamps. Who would ever have thought of your\r\ncollecting Wedgwoodware! but that is wholly different, like engravings\r\nor pictures. We are degenerate descendants of old Josiah W., for we have\r\nnot a bit of pretty ware in the house.\r\n\r\n... Notwithstanding the very pleasant reason you give for our not\r\nenjoying a holiday, namely, that we have no vices, it is a horrid bore.\r\nI have been trying for health's sake to be idle, with no success. What I\r\nshall now have to do, will be to erect a tablet in Down Church, \"Sacred\r\nto the Memory, etc.,\" and officially die, and then publish books, \"by\r\nthe late Charles Darwin,\" for I cannot think what has come over me of\r\nlate; I always suffered from the excitement of talking, but now it has\r\nbecome ludicrous. I talked lately 1 1/2 hours (broken by tea by myself)\r\nwith my nephew, and I was [ill] half the night. It is a fearful evil for\r\nself and family.\r\n\r\nGood-night. Ever yours. C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter to Sir Julius von Haast (Sir Julius von Haast was\r\na German by birth, but had long been resident in New Zealand. He was,\r\nin 1862, Government Geologist to the Province of Canterbury.), is an\r\nexample of the sympathy which he felt with the spread and growth of\r\nscience in the colonies. It was a feeling not expressed once only, but\r\nwas frequently present in his mind, and often found utterance. When we,\r\nat Cambridge, had the satisfaction of receiving Sir J. von Haast into\r\nour body as a Doctor of Science (July 1886), I had the opportunity of\r\nhearing from him of the vivid pleasure which this, and other letters\r\nfrom my father, gave him. It was pleasant to see how strong had been\r\nthe impression made by my father's warm-hearted sympathy--an impression\r\nwhich seemed, after more than twenty years, to be as fresh as when it\r\nwas first received:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO JULIUS VON HAAST. Down, January 22 [1863].\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you most sincerely for sending me your Address and the\r\nGeological Report. (Address to the 'Philosophical Institute of\r\nCanterbury (N.Z.).' The \"Report\" is given in \"The New Zealand Government\r\nGazette, Province of Canterbury\", October 1862.) I have seldom in my\r\nlife read anything more spirited and interesting than your address. The\r\nprogress of your colony makes one proud, and it is really admirable to\r\nsee a scientific institution founded in so young a nation. I thank\r\nyou for the very honourable notice of my 'Origin of Species.' You will\r\neasily believe how much I have been interested by your striking facts\r\non the old glacial period, and I suppose the world might be searched in\r\nvain for so grand a display of terraces. You have, indeed, a noble\r\nfield for scientific research and discovery. I have been extremely\r\nmuch interested by what you say about the tracks of supposed [living]\r\nmammalia. Might I ask, if you succeed in discovering what the creatures\r\nare, you would have the great kindness to inform me? Perhaps they may\r\nturn out something like the Solenhofen bird creature, with its long\r\ntail and fingers, with claws to its wings! I may mention that in South\r\nAmerica, in completely uninhabited regions, I found spring rat-traps,\r\nbaited with CHEESE, were very successful in catching the smaller\r\nmammals. I would venture to suggest to you to urge on some of the\r\ncapable members of your institution to observe annually the rate and\r\nmanner of spreading of European weeds and insects, and especially to\r\nobserve WHAT NATIVE PLANTS MOST FAIL; this latter point has never been\r\nattended to. Do the introduced hive-bees replace any other insect? etc.\r\nAll such points are, in my opinion, great desiderata in science. What an\r\ninteresting discovery that of the remains of prehistoric man!\r\n\r\nBelieve me, dear Sir, With the most cordial respect and thanks, Yours\r\nvery faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO CAMILLE DARESTE. (Professor Dareste is a well-known\r\nworker in Animal Teratology. He was in 1863 living at Lille, but has\r\nsince then been called to Paris. My father took a special interest in\r\nDareste's work on the production of monsters, as bearing on the causes\r\nof variation.) Down, February 16 [1863].\r\n\r\nDear and respected Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your letter and your pamphlet. I had heard\r\n(I think in one of M. Quatrefages' books) of your work, and was most\r\nanxious to read it, but did not know where to find it. You could not\r\nhave made me a more valuable present. I have only just returned\r\nhome, and have not yet read your work; when I do if I wish to ask any\r\nquestions I will venture to trouble you. Your approbation of my book\r\non Species has gratified me extremely. Several naturalists in England,\r\nNorth America, and Germany, have declared that their opinions on the\r\nsubject have in some degree been modified, but as far as I know, my book\r\nhas produced no effect whatever in France, and this makes me the more\r\ngratified by your very kind expression of approbation. Pray believe me,\r\ndear Sir, with much respect,\r\n\r\nYours faithfully and obliged, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, February 24 [1863].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI am astonished at your note, I have not seen the \"Athenaeum\" (In the\r\n'Antiquity of Man,' first edition, page 480, Lyell criticised somewhat\r\nseverely Owen's account of the difference between the Human and Simian\r\nbrains. The number of the \"Athenaeum\" here referred to (1863, page 262)\r\ncontains a reply by Professor Owen to Lyell's strictures. The surprise\r\nexpressed by my father was at the revival of a controversy which every\r\none believed to be closed. Prof. Huxley (\"Medical Times\", October 25,\r\n1862, quoted in 'Man's Place in Nature,' page 117) spoke of the \"two\r\nyears during which this preposterous controversy has dragged its weary\r\nlength.\" And this no doubt expressed a very general feeling.) but I have\r\nsent for it, and may get it to-morrow; and will then say what I think.\r\n\r\nI have read Lyell's book. ['The Antiquity of Man.'] the whole certainty\r\nstruck me as a compilation, but of the highest class, for when possible\r\nthe facts have been verified on the spot, making it almost an original\r\nwork. The Glacial chapters seem to me best, and in parts magnificent. I\r\ncould hardly judge about Man, as all the gloss of novelty was completely\r\nworn off. But certainly the aggregation of the evidence produced a very\r\nstriking effect on my mind. The chapter comparing language and changes\r\nof species, seems most ingenious and interesting. He has shown great\r\nskill in picking out salient points in the argument for change of\r\nspecies; but I am deeply disappointed (I do not mean personally) to\r\nfind that his timidity prevents him giving any judgment... From all my\r\ncommunications with him I must ever think that he has really entirely\r\nlost faith in the immutability of species; and yet one of his strongest\r\nsentences is nearly as follows: \"If it should EVER (The italics are not\r\nLyell's.) be rendered highly probable that species change by variation\r\nand natural selection,\" etc., etc. I had hoped he would have guided the\r\npublic as far as his own belief went... One thing does please me on this\r\nsubject, that he seems to appreciate your work. No doubt the public or a\r\npart may be induced to think that as he gives to us a larger space than\r\nto Lamarck, he must think there is something in our views. When reading\r\nthe brain chapter, it struck me forcibly that if he had said openly\r\nthat he believed in change of species, and as a consequence that man was\r\nderived from some Quadrumanous animal, it would have been very proper\r\nto have discussed by compilation the differences in the most important\r\norgan, viz. the brain. As it is, the chapter seems to me to come in\r\nrather by the head and shoulders. I do not think (but then I am as\r\nprejudiced as Falconer and Huxley, or more so) that it is too severe;\r\nit struck me as given with judicial force. It might perhaps be said with\r\ntruth that he had no business to judge on a subject on which he knows\r\nnothing; but compilers must do this to a certain extent. (You know I\r\nvalue and rank high compilers, being one myself!) I have taken you\r\nat your word, and scribbled at great length. If I get the \"Athenaeum\"\r\nto-morrow, I will add my impression of Owen's letter.\r\n\r\n... The Lyells are coming here on Sunday evening to stay till Wednesday.\r\nI dread it, but I must say how much disappointed I am that he has not\r\nspoken out on species, still less on man. And the best of the joke is\r\nthat he thinks he has acted with the courage of a martyr of old. I\r\nhope I may have taken an exaggerated view of his timidity, and shall\r\nPARTICULARLY be glad of your opinion on this head. (On this subject\r\nmy father wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker: \"Cordial thanks for your deeply\r\ninteresting letters about Lyell, Owen, and Co. I cannot say how glad\r\nI am to hear that I have not been unjust about the species-question\r\ntowards Lyell. I feared I had been unreasonable.\") When I got his book I\r\nturned over the pages, and saw he had discussed the subject of species,\r\nand said that I thought he would do more to convert the public than all\r\nof us, and now (which makes the case worse for me) I must, in common\r\nhonesty, retract. I wish to Heaven he had said not a word on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY MORNING:\r\n\r\nI have read the \"Athenaeum\". I do not think Lyell will be nearly so\r\nmuch annoyed as you expect. The concluding sentence is no doubt very\r\nstinging. No one but a good anatomist could unravel Owen's letter; at\r\nleast it is quite beyond me.\r\n\r\n... Lyell's memory plays him false when he says all anatomists were\r\nastonished at Owen's paper (\"On the Characters, etc., of the Class\r\nMammalia.\" 'Linn. Soc. Journal,' ii, 1858.); it was often quoted\r\nwith approbation. I WELL remember Lyell's admiration at this new\r\nclassification! (Do not repeat this.) I remember it, because, though\r\nI knew nothing whatever about the brain, I felt a conviction that a\r\nclassification thus founded on a single character would break down,\r\nand it seemed to me a great error not to separate more completely the\r\nMarsupialia...\r\n\r\nWhat an accursed evil it is that there should be all this quarrelling\r\nwithin, what ought to be, the peaceful realms of science. I will go\r\nto my own present subject of inheritance and forget it all for a time.\r\nFarewell, my dear old friend,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, February 23 [1863].\r\n\r\n... If you have time to read you will be interested by parts of Lyell's\r\nbook on man; but I fear that the best part, about the Glacial period,\r\nmay be too geological for any one except a regular geologist. He quotes\r\nyou at the end with gusto. By the way, he told me the other day how\r\npleased some had been by hearing that they could purchase your pamphlet.\r\nThe \"Parthenon\" also speaks of it as the ablest contribution to\r\nthe literature of the subject. It delights me when I see your work\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nThe Lyells come here this day week, and I shall grumble at his excessive\r\ncaution... The public may well say, if such a man dare not or will not\r\nspeak out his mind, how can we who are ignorant form even a guess on the\r\nsubject? Lyell was pleased when I told him lately that you thought that\r\nlanguage might be used as an excellent illustration of derivation of\r\nspecies; you will see that he has an ADMIRABLE chapter on this...\r\n\r\nI read Cairns's excellent Lecture (Prof. J.E. Cairns, 'The Slave Power,\r\netc.: an attempt to explain the real issues involved in the American\r\ncontest.' 1862.), which shows so well how your quarrel arose from\r\nSlavery. It made me for a time wish honestly for the North; but I could\r\nnever help, though I tried, all the time thinking how we should be\r\nbullied and forced into a war by you, when you were triumphant. But I do\r\nmost truly think it dreadful that the South, with its accursed slavery,\r\nshould triumph, and spread the evil. I think if I had power, which thank\r\nGod, I have not, I would let you conquer the border States, and all west\r\nof the Mississippi, and then force you to acknowledge the cotton States.\r\nFor do you not now begin to doubt whether you can conquer and hold them?\r\nI have inflicted a long tirade on you.\r\n\r\n\"The Times\" is getting more detestable (but that is too weak a word)\r\nthan ever. My good wife wishes to give it up, but I tell her that is a\r\npitch of heroism to which only a woman is equal. To give up the \"Bloody\r\nOld 'Times',\" as Cobbett used to call it, would be to give up meat,\r\ndrink and air. Farewell, my dear Gray,\r\n\r\nYours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, March 6, [1863].\r\n\r\n... I have been of course deeply interested by your book. ('Antiquity\r\nof Man.') I have hardly any remarks worth sending, but will scribble a\r\nlittle on what most interested me. But I will first get out what I hate\r\nsaying, viz., that I have been greatly disappointed that you have not\r\ngiven judgment and spoken fairly out what you think about the derivation\r\nof species. I should have been contented if you had boldly said that\r\nspecies have not been separately created, and had thrown as much doubt\r\nas you like on how far variation and natural selection suffices. I hope\r\nto Heaven I am wrong (and from what you say about Whewell it seems\r\nso), but I cannot see how your chapters can do more good than an\r\nextraordinary able review. I think the \"Parthenon\" is right, that you\r\nwill leave the public in a fog. No doubt they may infer that as you give\r\nmore space to myself, Wallace, and Hooker, than to Lamarck, you think\r\nmore of us. But I had always thought that your judgment would have been\r\nan epoch in the subject. All that is over with me, and I will only think\r\non the admirable skill with which you have selected the striking points,\r\nand explained them. No praise can be too strong, in my opinion, for the\r\ninimitable chapter on language in comparison with species.\r\n\r\n(After speculating on the sudden appearance of individuals far above the\r\naverage of the human race, Lyell asks if such leaps upwards in the\r\nscale of intellect may not \"have cleared at one bound the space which\r\nseparated the higher stage of the unprogressive intelligence of the\r\ninferior animals from the first and lowest form of improvable reason\r\nmanifested by man.\") page 505--A sentence at the top of the page makes\r\nme groan...\r\n\r\nI know you will forgive me for writing with perfect freedom, for you\r\nmust know how deeply I respect you as my old honoured guide and master.\r\nI heartily hope and expect that your book will have gigantic circulation\r\nand may do in many ways as much good as it ought to do. I am tired,\r\nso no more. I have written so briefly that you will have to guess my\r\nmeaning. I fear my remarks are hardly worth sending. Farewell, with\r\nkindest remembrance to Lady Lyell.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mr. Huxley has quoted (vol. i. page 546) some passages from Lyell's\r\nletters which show his state of mind at this time. The following\r\npassage, from a letter of March 11th to my father, is also of much\r\ninterest:--\r\n\r\n\"My feelings, however, more than any thought about policy or expediency,\r\nprevent me from dogmatising as to the descent of man from the brutes,\r\nwhich, though I am prepared to accept it, takes away much of the charm\r\nfrom my speculations on the past relating to such matters... But you\r\nought to be satisfied, as I shall bring hundreds towards you who, if I\r\ntreated the matter more dogmatically, would have rebelled.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, 12 [March, 1863].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI thank you for your very interesting and kind, I may say, charming\r\nletter. I feared you might be huffed for a little time with me. I know\r\nsome men would have been so. I have hardly any more criticisms, anyhow,\r\nworth writing. But I may mention that I felt a little surprise that\r\nold B. de Perthes (1788-1868. See footnote below.) was not rather more\r\nhonourably mentioned. I would suggest whether you could not leave out\r\nsome references to the 'Principles;' one for the real student is as\r\ngood as a hundred, and it is rather irritating, and gives a feeling\r\nof incompleteness to the general reader to be often referred to other\r\nbooks. As you say that you have gone as far as you believe on the\r\nspecies question, I have not a word to say; but I must feel convinced\r\nthat at times, judging from conversation, expressions, letters, etc.,\r\nyou have as completely given up belief in immutability of specific forms\r\nas I have done. I must still think a clear expression from you, IF YOU\r\nCOULD HAVE GIVEN IT, would have been potent with the public, and all\r\nthe more so, as you formerly held opposite opinions. The more I work the\r\nmore satisfied I become with variation and natural selection, but that\r\npart of the case I look at as less important, though more interesting\r\nto me personally. As you ask for criticisms on this head (and believe\r\nme that I should not have made them unasked), I may specify (pages 412,\r\n413) that such words as \"Mr. D. labours to show,\" \"is believed by the\r\nauthor to throw light,\" would lead a common reader to think that you\r\nyourself do NOT at all agree, but merely think it fair to give my\r\nopinion. Lastly, you refer repeatedly to my view as a modification\r\nof Lamarck's doctrine of development and progression. If this is your\r\ndeliberate opinion there is nothing to be said, but it does not seem\r\nso to me. Plato, Buffon, my grandfather before Lamarck, and others,\r\npropounded the OBVIOUS views that if species were not created separately\r\nthey must have descended from other species, and I can see nothing\r\nelse in common between the 'Origin' and Lamarck. I believe this way\r\nof putting the case is very injurious to its acceptance, as it implies\r\nnecessary progression, and closely connects Wallace's and my views with\r\nwhat I consider, after two deliberate readings, as a wretched book, and\r\none from which (I well remember my surprise) I gained nothing. But I\r\nknow you rank it higher, which is curious, as it did not in the least\r\nshake your belief. But enough, and more than enough. Please remember you\r\nhave brought it all down on yourself!!!\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to hear about Falconer's \"reclamation.\" (\"Falconer, whom\r\nI referred to oftener than to any other author, says I have not done\r\njustice to the part he took in resuscitating the cave question, and says\r\nhe shall come out with a separate paper to prove it. I offered to alter\r\nanything in the new edition, but this he declined.--C. Lyell to C.\r\nDarwin, March 11, 1863; Lyell's 'Life,' vol. ii. page 364.) I hate the\r\nvery word, and have a sincere affection for him.\r\n\r\nDid you ever read anything so wretched as the \"Athenaeum\" reviews of\r\nyou, and of Huxley ('Man's Place in Nature,' 1863.) especially. Your\r\nOBJECT to make man old, and Huxley's OBJECT to degrade him. The wretched\r\nwriter has not a glimpse what the discovery of scientific truth means.\r\nHow splendid some pages are in Huxley, but I fear the book will not be\r\npopular...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [March 13, 1863].\r\n\r\nI should have thanked you sooner for the \"Athenaeum\" and very pleasant\r\nprevious note, but I have been busy, and not a little uncomfortable from\r\nfrequent uneasy feeling of fullness, slight pain and tickling about\r\nthe heart. But as I have no other symptoms of heart complaint I do not\r\nsuppose it is affected... I have had a most kind and delightfully candid\r\nletter from Lyell, who says he spoke out as far as he believes. I have\r\nno doubt his belief failed him as he wrote, for I feel sure that at\r\ntimes he no more believed in Creation than you or I. I have grumbled a\r\nbit in my answer to him at his ALWAYS classing my work as a modification\r\nof Lamarck's, which it is no more than any author who did not believe in\r\nimmutability of species, and did believe in descent. I am very sorry to\r\nhear from Lyell that Falconer is going to publish a formal reclamation\r\nof his own claims...\r\n\r\nIt is cruel to think of it, but we must go to Malvern in the middle of\r\nApril; it is ruin to me. (He went to Hartfield in Sussex, on April 27,\r\nand to Malvern in the autumn.)...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, March 17 [1863].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI have been much interested by your letters and enclosure, and thank you\r\nsincerely for giving me so much time when you must be so busy. What a\r\ncurious letter from B. de P. [Boucher de Perthes]. He seems perfectly\r\nsatisfied, and must be a very amiable man. I know something about his\r\nerrors, and looked at his book many years ago, and am ashamed to\r\nthink that I concluded the whole was rubbish! Yet he has done for\r\nman something like what Agassiz did for glaciers. (In his 'Antiquites\r\nCeltiques' (1847), Boucher de Perthes described the flint tools found\r\nat Abbeville with bones of rhinoceros, hyaena, etc. \"But the scientific\r\nworld had no faith in the statement that works of art, however rude,\r\nhad been met with in undisturbed beds of such antiquity.\" ('Antiquity of\r\nMan,' first edition, page 95).)\r\n\r\nI cannot say that I agree with Hooker about the public not liking to\r\nbe told what to conclude, IF COMING FROM ONE IN YOUR POSITION. But I am\r\nheartily sorry that I was led to make complaints, or something very like\r\ncomplaints, on the manner in which you have treated the subject, and\r\nstill more so anything about myself. I steadily ENDEAVOUR never to\r\nforget my firm belief that no one can at all judge about his own work.\r\nAs for Lamarck, as you have such a man as Grove with you, you are\r\ntriumphant; not that I can alter my opinion that to me it was an\r\nabsolutely useless book. Perhaps this was owing to my always searching\r\nbooks for facts, perhaps from knowing my grandfather's earlier and\r\nidentically the same speculation. I will only further say that if I can\r\nanalyse my own feelings (a very doubtful process), it is nearly as much\r\nfor your sake as for my own, that I so much wish that your state of\r\nbelief could have permitted you to say boldly and distinctly out that\r\nspecies were not separately created. I have generally told you the\r\nprogress of opinion, as I have heard it, on the species question. A\r\nfirst-rate German naturalist (No doubt Haeckel, whose monograph on the\r\nRadiolaria was published in 1862. In the same year Professor W. Preyer\r\nof Jena published a dissertation on Alca impennis, which was one of\r\nthe earliest pieces of special work on the basis of the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies.') (I now forget the name!), who has lately published a grand\r\nfolio, has spoken out to the utmost extent on the 'Origin.' De Candolle,\r\nin a very good paper on \"Oaks,\" goes, in Asa Gray's opinion, as far as\r\nhe himself does; but De Candolle, in writing to me, says WE, \"we think\r\nthis and that;\" so that I infer he really goes to the full extent\r\nwith me, and tells me of a French good botanical palaeontologist (name\r\nforgotten) (The Marquis de Saporta.), who writes to De Candolle that he\r\nis sure that my views will ultimately prevail. But I did not intend to\r\nhave written all this. It satisfies me with the final results, but\r\nthis result, I begin to see, will take two or three lifetimes. The\r\nentomologists are enough to keep the subject back for half a century. I\r\nreally pity your having to balance the claims of so many eager aspirants\r\nfor notice; it is clearly impossible to satisfy all... Certainly I was\r\nstruck with the full and due honour you conferred on Falconer. I have\r\njust had a note from Hooker... I am heartily glad that you have made him\r\nso conspicuous; he is so honest, so candid, and so modest...\r\n\r\nI have read --. I could find nothing to lay hold of, which in one sense\r\nI am very glad of, as I should hate a controversy; but in another\r\nsense I am very sorry for, as I long to be in the same boat with all my\r\nfriends... I am heartily glad the book is going off so well.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [March 29, 1863].\r\n\r\n... Many thanks for \"Athenaeum\", received this morning, and to be\r\nreturned to-morrow morning. Who would have ever thought of the old\r\nstupid \"Athenaeum\" taking to Oken-like transcendental philosophy\r\nwritten in Owenian style! (This refers to a review of Dr. Carpenter's\r\n'Introduction to the study of Foraminifera,' that appeared in the\r\n\"Athenaeum\" of March 28, 1863 (page 417). The reviewer attacks Dr.\r\nCarpenter's views in as much as they support the doctrine of Descent;\r\nand he upholds spontaneous generation (Heterogeny) in place of what Dr.\r\nCarpenter, naturally enough, believed in, viz. the genetic connection of\r\nliving and extinct Foraminifera. In the next number is a letter by Dr.\r\nCarpenter, which chiefly consists of a protest against the reviewer's\r\nsomewhat contemptuous classification of Dr. Carpenter and my father\r\nas disciple and master. In the course of the letter Dr. Carpenter\r\nsays--page 461:--\r\n\r\n\"Under the influence of his foregone conclusion that I have accepted\r\nMr. Darwin as my master, and his hypothesis as my guide, your reviewer\r\nrepresents me as blind to the significance of the general fact stated by\r\nme, that 'there has been no advance in the foraminiferous type from\r\nthe palaeozoic period to the present time.' But for such a foregone\r\nconclusion he would have recognised in this statement the expression of\r\nmy conviction that the present state of scientific evidence, instead of\r\nsanctioning the idea that the descendants of the primitive type or\r\ntypes of Foraminifera can ever rise to any higher grade, justifies the\r\nANTI-DARWINIAN influence, that however widely they diverge from each\r\nother and from their originals, THEY STILL REMAIN FORAMINIFERA.\")... It\r\nwill be some time before we see \"slime, protoplasm, etc.,\" generating a\r\nnew animal. (On the same subject my father wrote in 1871: \"It is often\r\nsaid that all the conditions for the first production of a living\r\norganism are now present, which could ever have been present. But if\r\n(and oh! what a big if!) we could conceive in some warm little\r\npond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat,\r\nelectricity, etc., present, that a proteine compound was chemically\r\nformed ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day\r\nsuch matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not\r\nhave been the case before living creatures were formed.\") But I\r\nhave long regretted that I truckled to public opinion, and used the\r\nPentateuchal term of creation (This refers to a passage in which the\r\nreviewer of Dr. Carpenter's books speaks of \"an operation of force,\" or\r\n\"a concurrence of forces which have now no place in nature,\" as\r\nbeing, \"a creative force, in fact, which Darwin could only express in\r\nPentateuchal terms as the primordial form 'into which life was\r\nfirst breathed.'\" The conception of expressing a creative force as a\r\nprimordial form is the Reviewer's.), by which I really meant \"appeared\"\r\nby some wholly unknown process. It is mere rubbish, thinking at present\r\nof the origin of life; one might as well think of the origin of matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Friday night [April 17, 1863].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have heard from Oliver that you will be now at Kew, and so I am going\r\nto amuse myself by scribbling a bit. I hope you have thoroughly enjoyed\r\nyour tour. I never in my life saw anything like the spring flowers this\r\nyear. What a lot of interesting things have been lately published.\r\nI liked extremely your review of De Candolle. What an awfully severe\r\narticle that by Falconer on Lyell (\"Athenaeum\", April 4, 1863, page 459.\r\nThe writer asserts that justice has not been done either to himself\r\nor Mr. Prestwich--that Lyell has not made it clear that it was their\r\noriginal work which supplied certain material for the 'Antiquity\r\nof Man.' Falconer attempts to draw an unjust distinction between a\r\n\"philosopher\" (here used as a polite word for compiler) like Sir Charles\r\nLyell, and original observers, presumably such as himself, and Mr.\r\nPrestwich. Lyell's reply was published in the \"Athenaeum\", April\r\n18, 1863. It ought to be mentioned that a letter from Mr. Prestwich\r\n(\"Athenaeum\", page 555), which formed part of the controversy, though of\r\nthe nature of a reclamation, was written in a very different spirit and\r\ntone from Dr. Falconer's.); I am very sorry for it; I think Falconer on\r\nhis side does not do justice to old Perthes and Schmerling... I shall\r\nbe very curious to see how he [Lyell] answers it t-morrow. (I have been\r\ncompelled to take in the \"Athenaeum\" for a while.) I am very sorry that\r\nFalconer should have written so spitefully, even if there is some truth\r\nin his accusations; I was rather disappointed in Carpenter's letter, no\r\none could have given a better answer, but the chief object of his letter\r\nseems to me to be to show that though he has touched pitch he is not\r\ndefiled. No one would suppose he went so far as to believe all birds\r\ncame from one progenitor. I have written a letter to the \"Athenaeum\"\r\n(\"Athenaeum\", 1863, page 554: \"The view given by me on the origin or\r\nderivation of species, whatever its weaknesses may be, connects (as has\r\nbeen candidly admitted by some of its opponents, such as Pictet, Bronn,\r\netc.), by an intelligible thread of reasoning, a multitude of facts:\r\nsuch as the formation of domestic races by man's selection,--the\r\nclassification and affinities of all organic beings,--the innumerable\r\ngradations in structure and instincts,--the similarity of pattern in the\r\nhand, wing, or paddle of animals of the same great class,--the existence\r\nof organs become rudimentary by disuse,--the similarity of an embryonic\r\nreptile, bird, and mammal, with the retention of traces of an apparatus\r\nfitted for aquatic respiration; the retention in the young calf of\r\nincisor teeth in the upper jaw, etc.--the distribution of animals and\r\nplants, and their mutual affinities within the same region,--their\r\ngeneral geological succession, and the close relationship of the fossils\r\nin closely consecutive formations and within the same country;\r\nextinct marsupials having preceded living marsupials in Australia, and\r\narmadillo-like animals having preceded and generated armadilloes in\r\nSouth America,--and many other phenomena, such as the gradual extinction\r\nof old forms and their gradual replacement by new forms better fitted\r\nfor their new conditions in the struggle for life. When the advocate of\r\nHeterogeny can thus connect large classes of facts, and not until then,\r\nhe will have respectful and patient listeners.\") (the first and last\r\ntime I shall take such a step) to say, under the cloak of attacking\r\nHeterogeny, a word in my own defence. My letter is to appear next week,\r\nso the Editor says; and I mean to quote Lyell's sentence (See the next\r\nletter.) in his second edition, on the principle if one puffs oneself,\r\none had better puff handsomely...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, April 18 [1863].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI was really quite sorry that you had sent me a second copy (The second\r\nedition of the 'Antiquity of Man' was published a few months after the\r\nfirst had appeared.) of your valuable book. But after a few hours\r\nmy sorrow vanished for this reason: I have written a letter to the\r\n\"Athenaeum\", in order, under the cloak of attacking the monstrous\r\narticle on Heterogeny, to say a word for myself in answer to Carpenter,\r\nand now I have inserted a few sentences in allusion to your analogous\r\nobjection (Lyell objected that the mammalia (e.g. bats and seals) which\r\nalone have been able to reach oceanic islands ought to have become\r\nmodified into various terrestrial forms fitted to fill various places\r\nin their new home. My father pointed out in the \"Athenaeum\" that Sir\r\nCharles has in some measure answered his own objection, and went on to\r\nquote the \"amended sentence\" ('Antiquity of Man,' 2nd Edition page\r\n469) as showing how far Lyell agreed with the general doctrines of\r\nthe \"Origin of Species': \"Yet we ought by no means to undervalue the\r\nimportance of the step which will have been made, should it hereafter\r\nbecome the generally received opinion of men of science (as I fully\r\nexpect it will) that the past changes of the organic world have been\r\nbrought about by the subordinate agency of such causes as Variation and\r\nNatural Selection.\" In the first edition the words (as I fully expect\r\nit will,\" do not occur.) about bats on islands, and then with infinite\r\nslyness have quoted your amended sentence, with your parenthesis (\"as\r\nI fully believe\") (My father here quotes Lyell incorrectly; see the\r\nprevious foot-note.); I do not think you can be annoyed at my doing\r\nthis, and you see, that I am determined as far as I can, that the public\r\nshall see how far you go. This is the first time I have ever said a word\r\nfor myself in any journal, and it shall, I think, be the last. My\r\nletter is short, and no great things. I was extremely concerned to see\r\nFalconer's disrespectful and virulent letter. I like extremely your\r\nanswer just read; you take a lofty and dignified position, to which you\r\nare so well entitled. (In a letter to Sir J.D. Hooker he wrote: \"I\r\nmuch like Lyell's letter. But all this squabbling will greatly sink\r\nscientific men. I have seen sneers already in the 'Times'.\")\r\n\r\nI suspect that if you had inserted a few more superlatives in speaking\r\nof the several authors there would have been none of this horrid noise.\r\nNo one, I am sure, who knows you could doubt about your hearty sympathy\r\nwith every one who makes any little advance in science. I still well\r\nremember my surprise at the manner in which you listened to me in Hart\r\nStreet on my return from the \"Beagle's\" voyage. You did me a world of\r\ngood. It is horridly vexatious that so frank and apparently amiable a\r\nman as Falconer should have behaved so. (It is to this affair that the\r\nextract from a letter to Falconer, given in volume i., refers.) Well it\r\nwill all soon be forgotten...\r\n\r\n\r\n[In reply to the above-mentioned letter of my father's to the\r\n\"Athenaeum\", an article appeared in that Journal (May 2nd, 1863, page\r\n586), accusing my father of claiming for his views the exclusive merit\r\nof \"connecting by an intelligible thread of reasoning\" a number of\r\nfacts in morphology, etc. The writer remarks that, \"The different\r\ngeneralizations cited by Mr. Darwin as being connected by an\r\nintelligible thread of reasoning exclusively through his attempt to\r\nexplain specific transmutation are in fact related to it in this wise,\r\nthat they have prepared the minds of naturalists for a better reception\r\nof such attempts to explain the way of the origin of species from\r\nspecies.\"\r\n\r\nTo this my father replied in the \"Athenaeum\" of May 9th, 1863:]\r\n\r\nDown, May 5 [1863].\r\n\r\nI hope that you will grant me space to own that your reviewer is quite\r\ncorrect when he states that any theory of descent will connect, \"by an\r\nintelligible thread of reasoning,\" the several generalizations before\r\nspecified. I ought to have made this admission expressly; with the\r\nreservation, however, that, as far as I can judge, no theory so well\r\nexplains or connects these several generalizations (more especially\r\nthe formation of domestic races in comparison with natural species,\r\nthe principles of classification, embryonic resemblance, etc.) as the\r\ntheory, or hypothesis, or guess, if the reviewer so likes to call it, of\r\nNatural Selection. Nor has any other satisfactory explanation been ever\r\noffered of the almost perfect adaptation of all organic beings to each\r\nother, and to their physical conditions of life. Whether the naturalist\r\nbelieves in the views given by Lamarck, by Geoffrey St. Hilaire, by the\r\nauthor of the 'Vestiges,' by Mr. Wallace and myself, or in any other\r\nsuch view, signifies extremely little in comparison with the admission\r\nthat species have descended from other species, and have not been\r\ncreated immutable; for he who admits this as a great truth has a wide\r\nfield opened to him for further inquiry. I believe, however, from what\r\nI see of the progress of opinion on the Continent, and in this country,\r\nthat the theory of Natural Selection will ultimately be adopted, with,\r\nno doubt, many subordinate modifications and improvements.\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the following, he refers to the above letter to the \"Athenaeum:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Leith Hill Place, Saturday [May 11,\r\n1863].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYou give good advice about not writing in newspapers; I have been\r\ngnashing my teeth at my own folly; and this not caused by --'s sneers,\r\nwhich were so good that I almost enjoyed them. I have written once again\r\nto own to a certain extent of truth in what he says, and then if I am\r\never such a fool again, have no mercy on me. I have read the squib in\r\n\"Public Opinion\" (\"Public Opinion\", April 23, 1863. A lively account of\r\na police case, in which the quarrels of scientific men are satirised.\r\nMr. John Bull gives evidence that--\r\n\r\n\"The whole neighbourhood was unsettled by their disputes; Huxley\r\nquarrelled with Owen, Owen with Darwin, Lyell with Owen, Falconer and\r\nPrestwich with Lyell, and Gray the menagerie man with everybody. He had\r\npleasure, however, in stating that Darwin was the quietest of the set.\r\nThey were always picking bones with each other and fighting over their\r\ngains. If either of the gravel sifters or stone breakers found anything,\r\nhe was obliged to conceal it immediately, or one of the old bone\r\ncollectors would be sure to appropriate it first and deny the theft\r\nafterwards, and the consequent wrangling and disputes were as endless as\r\nthey were wearisome.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Mayor.--Probably the clergyman of the parish might exert some\r\ninfluence over them?\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman smiled, shook his head, and stated that he regretted to\r\nsay that no class of men paid so little attention to the opinions of the\r\nclergy as that to which these unhappy men belonged.\"); it is capital;\r\nif there is more, and you have a copy, do lend it. It shows well that a\r\nscientific man had better be trampled in dirt than squabble. I have\r\nbeen drawing diagrams, dissecting shoots, and muddling my brains to\r\na hopeless degree about the divergence of leaves, and have of course\r\nutterly failed. But I can see that the subject is most curious, and\r\nindeed astonishing...\r\n\r\n\r\n[The next letter refers to Mr. Bentham's presidential address to the\r\nLinnean Society (May 25, 1863). Mr. Bentham does not yield to the new\r\ntheory of Evolution, \"cannot surrender at discretion as long as many\r\nimportant outworks remain contestable.\" But he shows that the great body\r\nof scientific opinion is flowing in the direction of belief.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Pasteur by Mr. Bentham is in reference to the\r\npromulgation \"as it were ex cathedra,\" of a theory of spontaneous\r\ngeneration by the reviewer of Dr. Carpenter in the \"Athenaeum\" (March\r\n28, 1863). Mr. Bentham points out that in ignoring Pasteur's refutation\r\nof the supposed facts of spontaneous generation, the writer fails to act\r\nwith \"that impartiality which every reviewer is supposed to possess.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO G. BENTHAM. Down, May 22 [1863].\r\n\r\nMy dear Bentham,\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your kind and interesting letter. I have no fear\r\nof anything that a man like you will say annoying me in the very least\r\ndegree. On the other hand, any approval from one whose judgment and\r\nknowledge I have for many years so sincerely respected, will gratify\r\nme much. The objection which you well put, of certain forms remaining\r\nunaltered through long time and space, is no doubt formidable in\r\nappearance, and to a certain extent in reality according to my judgment.\r\nBut does not the difficulty rest much on our silently assuming that we\r\nknow more than we do? I have literally found nothing so difficult as to\r\ntry and always remember our ignorance. I am never weary, when walking\r\nin any new adjoining district or country, of reflecting how absolutely\r\nignorant we are why certain old plants are not there present, and other\r\nnew ones are, and others in different proportions. If we once fully feel\r\nthis, then in judging the theory of Natural Selection, which implies\r\nthat a form will remain unaltered unless some alteration be to its\r\nbenefit, is it so very wonderful that some forms should change much\r\nslower and much less, and some few should have changed not at all under\r\nconditions which to us (who really know nothing what are the important\r\nconditions) seem very different. Certainly a priori we might have\r\nanticipated that all the plants anciently introduced into Australia\r\nwould have undergone some modification; but the fact that they have not\r\nbeen modified does not seem to me a difficulty of weight enough to shake\r\na belief grounded on other arguments. I have expressed myself miserably,\r\nbut I am far from well to-day.\r\n\r\nI am very glad that you are going to allude to Pasteur; I was struck\r\nwith infinite admiration at his work. With cordial thanks, believe me,\r\ndear Bentham,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--In fact, the belief in Natural Selection must at present be\r\ngrounded entirely on general considerations. (1) On its being a vera\r\ncausa, from the struggle for existence; and the certain geological fact\r\nthat species do somehow change. (2) From the analogy of change under\r\ndomestication by man's selection. (3) And chiefly from this view\r\nconnecting under an intelligible point of view a host of facts. When we\r\ndescend to details, we can prove that no one species has changed [i.e.\r\nwe cannot prove that a single species has changed]; nor can we prove\r\nthat the supposed changes are beneficial, which is the groundwork of the\r\ntheory. Nor can we explain why some species have changed and others have\r\nnot. The latter case seems to me hardly more difficult to understand\r\nprecisely and in detail than the former case of supposed change. Bronn\r\nmay ask in vain, the old creationist school and the new school, why one\r\nmouse has longer ears than another mouse, and one plant more pointed\r\nleaves than another plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO G. BENTHAM. Down, June 19 [1863].\r\n\r\nMy dear Bentham,\r\n\r\nI have been extremely much pleased and interested by your address,\r\nwhich you kindly sent me. It seems to be excellently done, with as much\r\njudicial calmness and impartiality as the Lord Chancellor could have\r\nshown. But whether the \"immutable\" gentlemen would agree with the\r\nimpartiality may be doubted, there is too much kindness shown towards\r\nme, Hooker, and others, they might say. Moreover I verily believe that\r\nyour address, written as it is, will do more to shake the unshaken and\r\nbring on those leaning to our side, than anything written directly in\r\nfavour of transmutation. I can hardly tell why it is, but your address\r\nhas pleased me as much as Lyell's book disappointed me, that is, the\r\npart on species, though so cleverly written. I agree with all your\r\nremarks on the reviewers. By the way, Lecoq (Author of 'Geographie\r\nBotanique.' 9 vols. 1854-58.) is a believer in the change of species. I,\r\nfor one, can conscientiously declare that I never feel surprised at\r\nany one sticking to the belief of immutability; though I am often not a\r\nlittle surprised at the arguments advanced on this side. I remember too\r\nwell my endless oscillations of doubt and difficulty. It is to me really\r\nlaughable when I think of the years which elapsed before I saw what I\r\nbelieve to be the explanation of some parts of the case; I believe it\r\nwas fifteen years after I began before I saw the meaning and cause of\r\nthe divergence of the descendants of any one pair. You pay me some most\r\nelegant and pleasing compliments. There is much in your address which\r\nhas pleased me much, especially your remarks on various naturalists. I\r\nam so glad that you have alluded so honourably to Pasteur. I have just\r\nread over this note; it does not express strongly enough the interest\r\nwhich I have felt in reading your address. You have done, I believe, a\r\nreal good turn to the RIGHT SIDE. Believe me, dear Bentham,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1864.\r\n\r\n[In my father's diary for 1864 is the entry, \"Ill all January, February,\r\nMarch.\" About the middle of April (seven months after the beginning\r\nof the illness in the previous autumn) his health took a turn for the\r\nbetter. As soon as he was able to do any work, he began to write his\r\npapers on Lythrum, and on Climbing Plants, so that the work which now\r\nconcerns us did not begin until September, when he again set to work on\r\n'Animals and Plants.' A letter to Sir J.D. Hooker gives some account of\r\nthe r-commencement of the work: \"I have begun looking over my old MS.,\r\nand it is as fresh as if I had never written it; parts are astonishingly\r\ndull, but yet worth printing, I think; and other parts strike me as very\r\ngood. I am a complete millionaire in odd and curious little facts, and I\r\nhave been really astounded at my own industry whilst reading my chapters\r\non Inheritance and Selection. God knows when the book will ever be\r\ncompleted, for I find that I am very weak and on my best days cannot do\r\nmore than one or one and a half hours' work. It is a good deal harder\r\nthan writing about my dear climbing plants.\"\r\n\r\nIn this year he received the greatest honour which a scientific man can\r\nreceive in this country--the Copley Medal of the Royal Society. It is\r\npresented at the Anniversary Meeting on St. Andrew's Day (November 30),\r\nthe medalist being usually present to receive it, but this the state of\r\nmy father's health prevented. He wrote to Mr. Fox on this subject:--\r\n\r\n\"I was glad to see your hand-writing. The Copley, being open to all\r\nsciences and all the world, is reckoned a great honour; but excepting\r\nfrom several kind letters, such things make little difference to me. It\r\nshows, however, that Natural Selection is making some progress in this\r\ncountry, and that pleases me. The subject, however, is safe in foreign\r\nlands.\"\r\n\r\nTo Sir J.D. Hooker, also, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"How kind you have been about this medal; indeed, I am blessed with many\r\ngood friends, and I have received four or five notes which have warmed\r\nmy heart. I often wonder that so old a worn-out dog as I am is not quite\r\nforgotten. Talking of medals, has Falconer had the Royal? he surely\r\nought to have it, as ought John Lubbock. By the way, the latter tells\r\nme that some old members of the Royal are quite shocked at my having the\r\nCopley. Do you know who?\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Mr. Huxley:--\r\n\r\n\"I must and will answer you, for it is a real pleasure for me to thank\r\nyou cordially for your note. Such notes as this of yours, and a few\r\nothers, are the real medal to me, and not the round bit of gold. These\r\nhave given me a pleasure which will long endure; so believe in my\r\ncordial thanks for your note.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell, writing to my father in November 1864 ('Life,' vol.\r\nii. page 384), speaks of the supposed malcontents as being afraid to\r\ncrown anything so unorthodox as the 'Origin.' But he adds that if such\r\nwere their feelings \"they had the good sense to draw in their horns.\"\r\nIt appears, however, from the same letter, that the proposal to give the\r\nCopley Medal to my father in the previous year failed owing to a similar\r\nwant of courage--to Lyell's great indignation.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Reader\", December 3, 1864, General Sabine's presidential address\r\nat the Anniversary Meeting is reported at some length. Special weight\r\nwas laid on my father's work in Geology, Zoology, and Botany, but\r\nthe 'Origin of Species' is praised chiefly as containing \"a mass of\r\nobservations,\" etc. It is curious that as in the case of his election\r\nto the French Institution, so in this case, he was honoured not for\r\nthe great work of his life, but for his less important work in special\r\nlines. The paragraph in General Sabine's address which refers to the\r\n'Origin of Species,' is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"In his most recent work 'On the Origin of Species,' although opinions\r\nmay be divided or undecided with respect to its merits in some respects,\r\nall will allow that it contains a mass of observations bearing upon\r\nthe habits, structure, affinities, and distribution of animals, perhaps\r\nunrivalled for interest, minuteness, and patience of observation. Some\r\namongst us may perhaps incline to accept the theory indicated by the\r\ntitle of this work, while others may perhaps incline to refuse, or\r\nat least to remit it to a future time, when increased knowledge shall\r\nafford stronger grounds for its ultimate acceptance or rejection.\r\nSpeaking generally and collectively, we have expressly omitted it from\r\nthe grounds of our award.\"\r\n\r\nI believe I am right in saying that no little dissatisfaction at the\r\nPresident's manner of allusion to the 'Origin' was felt by some Fellows\r\nof the Society.\r\n\r\nThe presentation of the Copley Medal is of interest in another way,\r\ninasmuch as it led to Sir C. Lyell making, in his after-dinner speech, a\r\n\"confession of faith as to the 'Origin.'\" He wrote to my father ('Life,'\r\nvol. ii. page 384), \"I said I had been forced to give up my old faith\r\nwithout thoroughly seeing my way to a new one. But I think you would\r\nhave been satisfied with the length I went.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, October 3 [1864].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nIf I do not pour out my admiration of your article (\"Criticisms on\r\nthe Origin of Species,\" 'Nat. Hist. Review,' 1864. Republished in 'Lay\r\nSermons,' 1870, page 328. The work of Professor Kolliker referred to\r\nis 'Ueber die Darwin'sche Schopfungstheorie' (Leipzig, 1864). Toward\r\nProfessor Kolliker my father felt not only the respect due to so\r\ndistinguished a naturalist (a sentiment well expressed in Professor\r\nHuxley's review), but he had also a personal regard for him, and often\r\nalluded with satisfaction to the visit which Professor Kolliker paid at\r\nDown.) on Kolliker, I shall explode. I never read anything better done.\r\nI had much wished his article answered, and indeed thought of doing so\r\nmyself, so that I considered several points. You have hit on all, and on\r\nsome in addition, and oh! by Jove, how well you have done it. As I read\r\non and came to point after point on which I had thought, I could not\r\nhelp jeering and scoffing at myself, to see how infinitely better you\r\nhad done it than I could have done. Well, if any one, who does not\r\nunderstand Natural Selection, will read this, he will be a blockhead\r\nif it is not as clear as daylight. Old Flourens ('Examen du livre de M.\r\nDarwin sur l'origine des especes.' Par P. Flourens. 8vo. Paris, 1864.)\r\nwas hardly worth the powder and shot; but how capitally you bring in\r\nabout the Academician, and your metaphor of the sea-sand is INIMITABLE.\r\n\r\nIt is a marvel to me how you can resist becoming a regular reviewer.\r\nWell, I have exploded now, and it has done me a deal of good...\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the same article in the 'Natural History Review,' Mr. Huxley speaks\r\nof the book above alluded to by Flourens, the Secretaire Perpetuel of\r\nthe Academie des Sciences, as one of the two \"most elaborate criticisms\"\r\nof the 'Origin of Species' of the year. He quotes the following\r\npassage:--\r\n\r\n\"M. Darwin continue: 'Aucune distinction absolue n'a ete et ne peut etre\r\nentre les especes et les varietes!' Je vous ai deja dit que vous\r\nvous trompiez; une distinction absolue separe les varietes d'avec les\r\nespeces.\" Mr. Huxley remarks on this, \"Being devoid of the blessings of\r\nan Academy in England, we are unaccustomed to see our ablest men treated\r\nin this way even by a Perpetual Secretary.\" After demonstrating M.\r\nFlourens' misapprehension of Natural Selection, Mr. Huxley says, \"How\r\none knows it all by heart, and with what relief one reads at page 65 'Je\r\nlaisse M. Darwin.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the same subject my father wrote to Mr. Wallace:--\r\n\r\n\"A great gun, Flourens, has written a little dull book against me which\r\npleases me much, for it is plain that our good work is spreading in\r\nFrance. He speaks of the \"engouement\" about this book [the 'Origin'] \"so\r\nfull of empty and presumptuous thoughts.\" The passage here alluded to is\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Enfin l'ouvrage de M. Darwin a paru. On ne peut qu'etre frappe du\r\ntalent de l'auteur. Mais que d'idees obscures, que d'idees fausses! Quel\r\njargon metaphysique jete mal a propos dans l'histoire naturelle, qui\r\ntombe dans le galimatias des qu'elle sort des idees claires, des idees\r\njustes. Quel langage pretentieux et vide! Quelles personifications\r\npueriles et surannees! O lucidite! O solidite de l'esprit francais, que\r\ndevene-vous?\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n1865.\r\n\r\n[This was again a time of much ill-health, but towards the close of the\r\nyear he began to recover under the care of the late Dr. Bence-Jones,\r\nwho dieted him severely, and as he expressed it, \"half-starved him to\r\ndeath.\" He was able to work at 'Animals and Plants' until nearly the end\r\nof April, and from that time until December he did practically no work,\r\nwith the exception of looking over the 'Origin of Species' for a second\r\nFrench edition. He wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker:--\"I am, as it were, reading\r\nthe 'Origin' for the first time, for I am correcting for a second French\r\nedition: and upon my life, my dear fellow, it is a very good book, but\r\noh! my gracious, it is tough reading, and I wish it were done.\" (Towards\r\nthe end of the year my father received the news of a new convert to\r\nhis views, in the person of the distinguished American naturalist\r\nLesquereux. He wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker: \"I have had an enormous letter\r\nfrom Leo Lesquereux (after doubts, I did not think it worth sending you)\r\non Coal Flora. He wrote some excellent articles in 'Silliman' against\r\n'Origin' views; but he says now, after repeated reading of the book, he\r\nis a convert!\")\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter refers to the Duke of Argyll's address to the Royal\r\nSociety of Edinburgh, December 5th, 1864, in which he criticises the\r\n'Origin of Species.' My father seems to have read the Duke's address\r\nas reported in the \"Scotsman\" of December 6th, 1865. In a letter to my\r\nfather (January 16, 1865, 'Life,' vol. ii. page 385), Lyell wrote, \"The\r\naddress is a great step towards your views--far greater, I believe, than\r\nit seems when read merely with reference to criticisms and objections.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, January 22, [1865].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI thank you for your very interesting letter. I have the true English\r\ninstinctive reverence for rank, and therefore liked to hear about the\r\nPrincess Royal. (\"I had... an animated conversation on Darwinism with the\r\nPrincess Royal, who is a worthy daughter of her father, in the reading\r\nof good books, and thinking of what she reads. She was very much au fait\r\nat the 'Origin,' and Huxley's book, the 'Antiquity,' etc.\"--(Lyell's\r\n'Life,' vol. ii. page 385.) You ask what I think of the Duke's address,\r\nand I shall be glad to tell you. It seems to me EXTREMELY clever, like\r\neverything I have read of his; but I am not shaken--perhaps you will\r\nsay that neither gods nor men could shake me. I demur to the Duke\r\nreiterating his objection that the brilliant plumage of the male\r\nhumming-bird could not have been acquired through selection, at the same\r\ntime entirely ignoring my discussion (page 93, 3rd edition) on beautiful\r\nplumage being acquired through SEXUAL selection. The duke may think this\r\ninsufficient, but that is another question. All analogy makes me quite\r\ndisagree with the Duke that the difference in the beak, wing and tail,\r\nare not of importance to the several species. In the only two species\r\nwhich I have watched, the difference in flight and in the use of the\r\ntail was conspicuously great.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, who knows my Orchid book so well, might have learnt a lesson\r\nof caution from it, with respect to his doctrine of differences for mere\r\nvariety or beauty. It may be confidently said that no tribe of plants\r\npresents such grotesque and beautiful differences, which no one until\r\nlately, conjectured were of any use; but now in almost every case I have\r\nbeen able to show their important service. It should be remembered that\r\nwith humming birds or orchids, a modification in one part will cause\r\ncorrelated changes in other parts. I agree with what you say about\r\nbeauty. I formerly thought a good deal on the subject, and was led quite\r\nto repudiate the doctrine of beauty being created for beauty's sake. I\r\ndemur also to the Duke's expression of \"new births.\" That may be a very\r\ngood theory, but it is not mine, unless indeed he calls a bird born with\r\na beak 1/100th of an inch longer than usual \"a new birth;\" but this is\r\nnot the sense in which the term would usually be understood. The more\r\nI work the more I feel convinced that it is by the accumulation of\r\nsuch extremely slight variations that new species arise. I do not plead\r\nguilty to the Duke's charge that I forget that natural selection\r\nmeans only the preservation of variations which independently arise.\r\n(\"Strictly speaking, therefore, Mr. Darwin's theory is not a theory on\r\nthe Origin of Species at all, but only a theory on the causes which lead\r\nto the relative success and failure of such new forms as may be born\r\ninto the world.\"--\"Scotsman\", December 6, 1864.) I have expressed this\r\nin as strong language as I could use, but it would have been infinitely\r\ntedious had I on every occasion thus guarded myself. I will cry\r\n\"peccavi\" when I hear of the Duke or you attacking breeders for saying\r\nthat man has made his improved shorthorns, or pouter pigeons,\r\nor bantams. And I could quote still stronger expressions used by\r\nagriculturists. Man does make his artificial breeds, for his selective\r\npower is of such importance relatively to that of the slight spontaneous\r\nvariations. But no one will attack breeders for using such expressions,\r\nand the rising generation will not blame me.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your offer of sending me the 'Elements.' (Sixth edition\r\nin one volume.) I hope to read it all, but unfortunately reading makes\r\nmy head whiz more than anything else. I am able most days to work for\r\ntwo or three hours, and this makes all the difference in my happiness.\r\nI have resolved not to be tempted astray, and to publish nothing till my\r\nvolume on Variation is completed. You gave me excellent advice about\r\nthe footnotes in my Dog chapter, but their alteration gave me infinite\r\ntrouble, and I often wished all the dogs, and I fear sometimes you\r\nyourself, in the nether regions.\r\n\r\nWe (dictator and writer) send our best love to Lady Lyell.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--If ever you should speak with the Duke on the subject, please say\r\nhow much interested I was with his address.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In his autobiographical sketch my father has remarked that owing to\r\ncertain early memories he felt the honour of being elected to the Royal\r\nand Royal Medical Societies of Edinburgh \"more than any similar honour.\"\r\nThe following extract from a letter to Sir Joseph Hooker refers to\r\nhis election to the former of these societies. The latter part of the\r\nextract refers to the Berlin Academy, to which he was elected in 1878:--\r\n\r\n\"Here is a really curious thing, considering that Brewster is President\r\nand Balfour Secretary. I have been elected Honorary Member of the Royal\r\nSociety of Edinburgh. And this leads me to a third question. Does the\r\nBerlin Academy of Sciences send their Proceedings to Honorary Members?\r\nI want to know, to ascertain whether I am a member; I suppose not, for\r\nI think it would have made some impression on me; yet I distinctly\r\nremember receiving some diploma signed by Ehrenberg. I have been so\r\ncareless; I have lost several diplomas, and now I want to know what\r\nSocieties I belong to, as I observe every [one] tacks their titles to\r\ntheir names in the catalogue of the Royal Soc.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, February 21 [1865].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI have taken a long time to thank you very much for your present of the\r\n'Elements.'\r\n\r\nI am going through it all, reading what is new, and what I have\r\nforgotten, and this is a good deal.\r\n\r\nI am simply astonished at the amount of labour, knowledge, and clear\r\nthought condensed in this work. The whole strikes me as something quite\r\ngrand. I have been particularly interested by your account of Heer's\r\nwork and your discussion on the Atlantic Continent. I am particularly\r\ndelighted at the view which you take on this subject; for I have long\r\nthought Forbes did an ill service in so freely making continents.\r\n\r\nI have also been very glad to read your argument on the denudation of\r\nthe Weald, and your excellent resume on the Purbeck Beds; and this is\r\nthe point at which I have at present arrived in your book. I cannot\r\nsay that I am quite convinced that there is no connection beyond that\r\npointed out by you, between glacial action and the formation of lake\r\nbasins; but you will not much value my opinion on this head, as I have\r\nalready changed my mind some half-dozen times.\r\n\r\nI want to make a suggestion to you. I found the weight of your volume\r\nintolerable, especially when lying down, so with great boldness cut\r\nit into two pieces, and took it out of its cover; now could not Murray\r\nwithout any other change add to his advertisement a line saying, \"if\r\nbound in two volumes, one shilling or one shilling and sixpence extra.\"\r\nYou thus might originate a change which would be a blessing to all\r\nweak-handed readers.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Lyell, Yours most sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nOriginate a second REAL BLESSING and have the edges of the sheets cut\r\nlike a bound book. (This was a favourite reform of my father's. He wrote\r\nto the \"Athenaeum\" on the subject, February 5, 1867, pointing out how\r\nthat a book cut, even carefully, with a paper knife collects dust on its\r\nedges far more than a machine-cut book. He goes on to quote the case of\r\na lady of his acquaintance who was in the habit of cutting books with\r\nher thumb, and finally appeals to the \"Athenaeum\" to earn the gratitude\r\nof children \"who have to cut through dry and pictureless books for the\r\nbenefit of their elders.\" He tried to introduce the reform in the case\r\nof his own books, but found the conservatism of booksellers too strong\r\nfor him. The presentation copies, however, of all his later books were\r\nsent out with the edges cut.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO JOHN LUBBOCK. Down, June 11 [1865].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lubbock,\r\n\r\nThe latter half of your book ('Prehistoric Times,' 1865.) has been\r\nread aloud to me, and the style is so clear and easy (we both think it\r\nperfection) that I am now beginning at the beginning. I cannot resist\r\ntelling you how excellently well, in my opinion, you have done the very\r\ninteresting chapter on savage life. Though you have necessarily only\r\ncompiled the materials the general result is most original. But I ought\r\nto keep the term original for your last chapter, which has struck me as\r\nan admirable and profound discussion. It has quite delighted me, for now\r\nthe public will see what kind of man you are, which I am proud to think\r\nI discovered a dozen years ago.\r\n\r\nI do sincerely wish you all success in your election and in politics;\r\nbut after reading this last chapter, you must let me say: oh, dear! oh,\r\ndear! oh dear!\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--You pay me a superb compliment ('Prehistoric Times,' page 487,\r\nwhere the words, \"the discoveries of a Newton or a Darwin,\" occur.),\r\nbut I fear you will be quizzed for it by some of your friends as too\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter refers to Fritz Muller's book, 'Fur Darwin,' which\r\nwas afterwards translated, at my father's suggestion, by Mr. Dallas. It\r\nis of interest as being the first of the long series of letters which my\r\nfather wrote to this distinguished naturalist. They never met, but the\r\ncorrespondence with Muller, which continued to the close of my father's\r\nlife, was a source of very great pleasure to him. My impression is that\r\nof all his unseen friends Fritz Muller was the one for whom he had the\r\nstrongest regard. Fritz Muller is the brother of another distinguished\r\nman, the late Hermann Muller, the author of 'Die Befruchtung der\r\nBlumen,' and of much other valuable work:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO F. MULLER. Down, August 10 [1865].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have been for a long time so ill that I have only just finished\r\nhearing read aloud your work on species. And now you must permit me to\r\nthank you cordially for the great interest with which I have read it.\r\nYou have done admirable service in the cause in which we both believe.\r\nMany of your arguments seem to me excellent, and many of your facts\r\nwonderful. Of the latter, nothing has surprised me so much as the\r\ntwo forms of males. I have lately investigated the cases of dimorphic\r\nplants, and I should much like to send you one or two of my papers if\r\nI knew how. I did send lately by post a paper on climbing plants, as an\r\nexperiment to see whether it would reach you. One of the points which\r\nhas struck me most in your paper is that on the differences in the\r\nair-breathing apparatus of the several forms. This subject appeared to\r\nme very important when I formerly considered the electric apparatus of\r\nfishes. Your observations on Classification and Embryology seem to me\r\nvery good and original. They show what a wonderful field there is for\r\nenquiry on the development of crustacea, and nothing has convinced me so\r\nplainly what admirable results we shall arrive at in Natural History\r\nin the course of a few years. What a marvellous range of structure the\r\ncrustacea present, and how well adapted they are for your enquiry! Until\r\nreading your book I knew nothing of the Rhizocephala; pray look at my\r\naccount and figures of Anelasma, for it seems to me that this latter\r\ncirripede is a beautiful connecting link with the Rhizocephala.\r\n\r\nIf ever you have any opportunity, as you are so skilful a dissector, I\r\nmuch wish that you would look to the orifice at the base of the first\r\npair of cirrhi in cirripedes, and at the curious organ in it, and\r\ndiscover what its nature is; I suppose I was quite in error, yet I\r\ncannot feel fully satisfied at Krohn's (See vol. ii., pages 138, 187.)\r\nobservations. Also if you ever find any species of Scalpellum, pray\r\nlook for complemental males; a German author has recently doubted my\r\nobservations for no reason except that the facts appeared to him so\r\nstrange.\r\n\r\nPermit me again to thank you cordially for the pleasure which I have\r\nderived from your work and to express my sincere admiration for your\r\nvaluable researches.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, dear Sir, with sincere respect, Yours very faithfully, CH.\r\nDARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I do not know whether you care at all about plants, but if so,\r\nI should much like to send you my little work on the 'Fertilization of\r\nOrchids,' and I think I have a German copy.\r\n\r\nCould you spare me a photograph of yourself? I should much like to\r\npossess one.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Thursday, 27th [September, 1865].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI had intended writing this morning to thank Mrs. Hooker most sincerely\r\nfor her last and several notes about you, and now your own note in your\r\nhand has rejoiced me. To walk between five and six miles is splendid,\r\nwith a little patience you must soon be well. I knew you had been very\r\nill, but I hardly knew how ill, until yesterday, when Bentham (from\r\nthe Cranworths (Robert Rolfe, Lord Cranworth, and Lord Chancellor of\r\nEngland, lived at Holwood, near Down.)) called here, and I was able to\r\nsee him for ten minutes. He told me also a little about the last days of\r\nyour father (Sir William Hooker; 1785-1865. He took charge of the Royal\r\nGardens at Kew, in 1840, when they ceased to be the private gardens\r\nof the Royal Family. In doing so, he gave up his professorship at\r\nGlasgow--and with it half of his income. He founded the herbarium and\r\nlibrary, and within ten years he succeeded in making the gardens the\r\nfirst in the world. It is, thus, not too much to say that the creation\r\nof the establishment at Kew is due to the abilities and self-devotion of\r\nSir William Hooker. While, for the subsequent development of the gardens\r\nup to their present magnificent condition, the nation must thank Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker, in whom the same qualities are so conspicuous.); I wish\r\nI had known your father better, my impression is confined to his\r\nremarkably cordial, courteous, and frank bearing. I fully concur and\r\nunderstand what you say about the difference of feeling in the loss of\r\na father and child. I do not think any one could love a father much\r\nmore than I did mine, and I do not believe three or four days ever pass\r\nwithout my still thinking of him, but his death at eight-four caused me\r\nnothing of that insufferable grief (I may quote here a passage from a\r\nletter of November, 1863. It was written to a friend who had lost his\r\nchild: \"How well I remember your feeling, when we lost Annie. It was my\r\ngreatest comfort that I had never spoken a harsh word to her. Your grief\r\nhas made me shed a few tears over our poor darling; but believe me that\r\nthese tears have lost that unutterable bitterness of former days.\")\r\nwhich the loss of our poor dear Annie caused. And this seems to me\r\nperfectly natural, for one knows for years previously that one's\r\nfather's death is drawing slowly nearer and nearer, while the death of\r\none's child is a sudden and dreadful wrench. What a wonderful deal you\r\nread; it is a horrid evil for me that I can read hardly anything, for\r\nit makes my head almost immediately begin to sing violently. My good\r\nwomenkind read to me a great deal, but I dare not ask for much science,\r\nand am not sure that I could stand it. I enjoyed Tylor ('Researches into\r\nthe Early History of Mankind,' by E.B. Tylor. 1865.) EXTREMELY, and\r\nthe first part of Lecky 'The Rise of Rationalism in Europe,' by W.E.H.\r\nLecky. 1865.); but I think the latter is often vague, and gives a false\r\nappearance of throwing light on his subject by such phrases as \"spirit\r\nof the age,\" \"spread of civilization,\" etc. I confine my reading to a\r\nquarter or half hour per day in skimming through the back volumes of the\r\nAnnals and Magazine of Natural History, and find much that interests me.\r\nI miss my climbing plants very much, as I could observe them when very\r\npoorly.\r\n\r\nI did not enjoy the 'Mill on the Floss' so much as you, but from what\r\nyou say we will read it again. Do you know 'Silas Marner'? it is a\r\ncharming little story; if you run short, and like to have it, we could\r\nsend it by post... We have almost finished the first volume of Palgrave\r\n(William Gifford Palgrave's 'Travels in Arabia,' published in 1865.),\r\nand I like it much; but did you ever see a book so badly arranged? The\r\nfrequency of the allusions to what will be told in the future are quite\r\nlaughable... By the way, I was very much pleased with the foot-note (The\r\npassage which seems to be referred to occurs in the text (page 479) of\r\n'Prehistoric Times.' It expresses admiration of Mr. Wallace's paper in\r\nthe 'Anthropological Review' (May, 1864), and speaks of the author's\r\n\"characteristic unselfishness\" in ascribing the theory of Natural\r\nSelection \"unreservedly to Mr. Darwin.\" about Wallace in Lubbock's\r\nlast chapter. I had not heard that Huxley had backed up Lubbock about\r\nParliament... Did you see a sneer some time ago in the \"Times\" about how\r\nincomparably more interesting politics were compared with science even\r\nto scientific men? Remember what Trollope says, in 'Can you Forgive\r\nher,' about getting into Parliament, as the highest earthly ambition.\r\nJeffrey, in one of his letters, I remember, says that making an\r\neffective speech in Parliament is a far grander thing than writing the\r\ngrandest history. All this seems to me a poor short-sighted view.\r\nI cannot tell you how it has rejoiced me once again seeing your\r\nhandwriting-- my best of old friends.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In October he wrote Sir J.D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"Talking of the 'Origin,' a Yankee has called my attention to a paper\r\nattached to Dr. Wells's famous 'Essay on Dew,' which was read in 1813\r\nto the Royal Society, but not [then] printed, in which he applies most\r\ndistinctly the principle of Natural Selection to the Races of Man. So\r\npoor old Patrick Matthew is not the first, and he cannot, or ought not,\r\nany longer to put on his title-pages, 'Discoverer of the principle of\r\nNatural Selection'!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO F.W. FARRAR. (Canon of Westminster.) Down, November 2\r\n[1865?].\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAs I have never studied the science of language, it may perhaps seem\r\npresumptuous, but I cannot resist the pleasure of telling you what\r\ninterest and pleasure I have derived from hearing read aloud your volume\r\n('Chapters on Language,' 1865.)\r\n\r\nI formerly read Max Muller, and thought his theory (if it deserves to be\r\ncalled so) both obscure and weak; and now, after hearing what you say,\r\nI feel sure that this is the case, and that your cause will ultimately\r\ntriumph. My indirect interest in your book has been increased from Mr.\r\nHensleigh Wedgwood, whom you often quote, being my brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nNo one could dissent from my views on the modification of species with\r\nmore courtesy than you do. But from the tenor of your mind I feel\r\nan entire and comfortable conviction (and which cannot possibly be\r\ndisturbed) that if your studies led you to attend much to general\r\nquestions in natural history you would come to the same conclusion that\r\nI have done.\r\n\r\nHave you ever read Huxley's little book of Lectures? I would gladly send\r\na copy if you think you would read it.\r\n\r\nConsidering what Geology teaches us, the argument from the supposed\r\nimmutability of specific types seems to me much the same as if, in a\r\nnation which had no old writings, some wise old savage was to say that\r\nhis language had never changed; but my metaphor is too long to fill up.\r\n\r\nPray believe me, dear Sir, yours very sincerely obliged, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1866.\r\n\r\n[The year 1866 is given in my father's Diary in the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"Continued correcting chapters of 'Domestic Animals.'\r\n\r\nMarch 1st.--Began on 4th edition of 'Origin' of 1250 copies (received\r\nfor it 238 pounds), making 7500 copies altogether.\r\n\r\nMay 10th.--Finished 'Origin,' except revises, and began going over\r\nChapter XIII. of 'Domestic Animals.'\r\n\r\nNovember 21st.--Finished 'Pangenesis.'\r\n\r\nDecember 21st.--Finished re-going over all chapters, and sent them to\r\nprinters.\r\n\r\nDecember 22nd.--Began concluding chapter of book.\"\r\n\r\nHe was in London on two occasions for a week at a time, staying with his\r\nbrother, and for a few days (May 29th-June 2nd) in Surrey; for the rest\r\nof the year he was at Down.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been a gradual mending in his health; thus he wrote\r\nto Mr. Wallace (January 1866):--\"My health is so far improved that I am\r\nable to work one or two hours a day.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to the 4th edition he wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"The new edition of the 'Origin' has caused me two great vexations. I\r\nforgot Bates's paper on variation (This appears to refer to \"Notes on\r\nSouth American Butterflies,\" Trans. Entomolog. Soc., vol. v. (N.S.).),\r\nbut I remembered in time his mimetic work, and now, strange to say, I\r\nfind I have forgotten your Arctic paper! I know how it arose; I indexed\r\nfor my bigger work, and never expected that a new edition of the\r\n'Origin' would be wanted.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say how all this has vexed me. Everything which I have read\r\nduring the last four years I find is quite washy in my mind.\" As far as\r\nI know, Mr. Bates's paper was not mentioned in the later editions of the\r\n'Origin,' for what reason I cannot say.\r\n\r\nIn connection with his work on 'The Variation of Animals and Plants,' I\r\ngive here extracts from three letters addressed to Mr. Huxley, which\r\nare of interest as giving some idea of the development of the theory of\r\n'Pangenesis,' ultimately published in 1868 in the book in question:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, May 27, [1865?].\r\n\r\n... I write now to ask a favour of you, a very great favour from one so\r\nhard worked as you are. It is to read thirty pages of MS., excellently\r\ncopied out and give me, not lengthened criticism, but your opinion\r\nwhether I may venture to publish it. You may keep the MS. for a month\r\nor two. I would not ask this favour, but I REALLY know no one else whose\r\njudgment on the subject would be final with me.\r\n\r\nThe case stands thus: in my next book I shall publish long chapters on\r\nbud- and seminal-variation, on inheritance, reversion, effects of use\r\nand disuse, etc. I have also for many years speculated on the different\r\nforms of reproduction. Hence it has come to be a passion with me to try\r\nto connect all such facts by some sort of hypothesis. The MS. which I\r\nwish to send you gives such a hypothesis; it is a very rash and crude\r\nhypothesis, yet it has been a considerable relief to my mind, and I\r\ncan hang on it a good many groups of facts. I well know that a mere\r\nhypothesis, and this is nothing more, is of little value; but it is very\r\nuseful to me as serving as a kind of summary for certain chapters. Now\r\nI earnestly wish for your verdict given briefly as, \"Burn it\"--or, which\r\nis the most favourable verdict I can hope for, \"It does rudely connect\r\ntogether certain facts, and I do not think it will immediately pass\r\nout of my mind.\" If you can say this much, and you do not think it\r\nabsolutely ridiculous, I shall publish it in my concluding chapter.\r\nNow will you grant me this favour? You must refuse if you are too much\r\noverworked.\r\n\r\nI must say for myself that I am a hero to expose my hypothesis to the\r\nfiery ordeal of your criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 12, [1865?].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nI thank you most sincerely for having so carefully considered my MS. It\r\nhas been a real act of kindness. It would have annoyed me extremely to\r\nhave re-published Buffon's views, which I did not know of, but I will\r\nget the book; and if I have strength I will also read Bonnet. I do not\r\ndoubt your judgment is perfectly just, and I will try to persuade myself\r\nnot to publish. The whole affair is much too speculative; yet I think\r\nsome such view will have to be adopted, when I call to mind such facts\r\nas the inherited effects of use and disuse, etc. But I will try to be\r\ncautious...\r\n\r\n\r\n[1865?].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nForgive my writing in pencil, as I can do so lying down. I have read\r\nBuffon: whole pages are laughably like mine. It is surprising how candid\r\nit makes one to see one's views in another man's words. I am rather\r\nashamed of the whole affair, but not converted to a no-belief. What a\r\nkindness you have done me with your \"vulpine sharpness.\" Nevertheless,\r\nthere is a fundamental distinction between Buffon's views and mine. He\r\ndoes not suppose that each cell or atom of tissue throws off a little\r\nbud; but he supposes that the sap or blood includes his \"organic\r\nmolecules,\" WHICH ARE READY FORMED, fit to nourish each organ, and when\r\nthis is fully formed, they collect to form buds and the sexual elements.\r\nIt is all rubbish to speculate as I have done; yet, if I ever\r\nhave strength to publish my next book, I fear I shall not resist\r\n\"Pangenesis,\" but I assure you I will put it humbly enough. The ordinary\r\ncourse of development of beings, such as the Echinodermata, in which\r\nnew organs are formed at quite remote spots from the analogous previous\r\nparts, seem to me extremely difficult to reconcile on any view except\r\nthe free diffusion in the parent of the germs or gemmules of each\r\nseparate new organ; and so in cases of alternate generation. But I will\r\nnot scribble any more. Hearty thanks to you, you best of critics and\r\nmost learned man...\r\n\r\n\r\n[The letters now take up the history of the year 1866.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, July 5 [1866].\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI have been much interested by your letter, which is as clear as\r\ndaylight. I fully agree with all that you say on the advantages of\r\nH. Spencer's excellent expression of \"the survival of the fittest.\"\r\n(Extract from a letter of Mr. Wallace's, July 2, 1866: \"The term\r\n'survival of the fittest' is the plain expression of the fact; 'natural\r\nselection' is a metaphorical expression of it, and to a certain degree\r\nindirect and incorrect, since... Nature... does not so much select special\r\nvarieties as exterminate the most unfavourable ones.\") This, however,\r\nhad not occurred to me till reading your letter. It is, however, a great\r\nobjection to this term that it cannot be used as a substantive governing\r\na verb; and that this is a real objection I infer from H. Spencer\r\ncontinually using the words, natural selection. I formerly thought,\r\nprobably in an exaggerated degree, that it was a great advantage to\r\nbring into connection natural and artificial selection; this indeed led\r\nme to use a term in common, and I still think it some advantage. I wish\r\nI had received your letter two months ago, for I would have worked in\r\n\"the survival, etc.,\" often in the new edition of the 'Origin,' which is\r\nnow almost printed off, and of which I will of course send you a copy. I\r\nwill use the term in my next book on Domestic Animals, etc., from which,\r\nby the way, I plainly see that you expect MUCH, too much. The term\r\nNatural Selection has now been so largely used abroad and at home, that\r\nI doubt whether it could be given up, and with all its faults I should\r\nbe sorry to see the attempt made. Whether it will be rejected must now\r\ndepend \"on the survival of the fittest.\" As in time the term must grow\r\nintelligible the objections to its use will grow weaker and weaker.\r\nI doubt whether the use of any term would have made the subject\r\nintelligible to some minds, clear as it is to others; for do we not see\r\neven to the present day Malthus on Population absurdly misunderstood?\r\nThis reflection about Malthus has often comforted me when I have been\r\nvexed at the misstatement of my views. As for M. Janet (This no doubt\r\nrefers to Janet's 'Materialisme Contemporain.'), he is a metaphysician,\r\nand such gentlemen are so acute that I think they often misunderstand\r\ncommon folk. Your criticism on the double sense (\"I find you use\r\n'Natural Selection' in two senses. 1st, for the simple preservation of\r\nfavourable and rejection of unfavourable variations, in which case it is\r\nequivalent to the 'survival of the fittest,'--and 2ndly, for the effect\r\nor CHANGE produced by this preservation.\" Extract from Mr. Wallace's\r\nletter above quoted.) in which I have used Natural Selection is new\r\nto me and unanswerable; but my blunder has done no harm, for I do not\r\nbelieve that any one, excepting you, has ever observed it. Again, I\r\nagree that I have said too much about \"favourable variations;\" but I am\r\ninclined to think that you put the opposite side too strongly; if every\r\npart of every being varied, I do not think we should see the same end,\r\nor object, gained by such wonderfully diversified means.\r\n\r\nI hope you are enjoying the country, and are in good health, and are\r\nworking hard at your Malay Archipelago book, for I will always put this\r\nwish in every note I write to you, like some good people always put in\r\na text. My health keeps much the same, or rather improves, and I am able\r\nto work some hours daily. With many thanks for your interesting letter.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Wallace, yours sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, August 30 [1866].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI was very glad to get your note and the Notts. Newspaper. I have seldom\r\nbeen more pleased in my life than at hearing how successfully your\r\nlecture (At the Nottingham meeting of the British Association,\r\nAugust 27, 1866. The subject of the lecture was 'Insular Floras.' See\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle\", 1866.) went off. Mrs. H. Wedgwood sent us an\r\naccount, saying that you read capitally, and were listened to with\r\nprofound attention and great applause. She says, when your final\r\nallegory (Sir Joseph Hooker allegorized the Oxford meeting of the\r\nBritish Association as the gathering of a tribe of savages who believed\r\nthat the new moon was created afresh each month. The anger of the\r\npriests and medicine man at a certain heresy, according to which the new\r\nmoon is but the offspring of the old one, is excellently given.) began,\r\n\"for a minute or two we were all mystified, and then came such bursts\r\nof applause from the audience. It was thoroughly enjoyed amid roars of\r\nlaughter and noise, making a most brilliant conclusion.\"\r\n\r\nI am rejoiced that you will publish your lecture, and felt sure that\r\nsooner or later it would come to this, indeed it would have been a\r\nsin if you had not done so. I am especially rejoiced as you give the\r\narguments for occasional transport, with such perfect fairness; these\r\nwill now receive a fair share of attention, as coming from you a\r\nprofessed botanist. Thanks also for Grove's address; as a whole it\r\nstrikes me as very good and original, but I was disappointed in the part\r\nabout Species; it dealt in such generalities that it would apply to any\r\nview or no view in particular...\r\n\r\nAnd now farewell. I do most heartily rejoice at your success, and for\r\nGrove's sake at the brilliant success of the whole meeting.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The next letter is of interest, as giving the beginning of the\r\nconnection which arose between my father and Professor Victor Carus. The\r\ntranslation referred to is the third German edition made from the\r\nfourth English one. From this time forward Professor Carus continued\r\nto translate my father's books into German. The conscientious care with\r\nwhich this work was done was of material service, and I well\r\nremember the admiration (mingled with a tinge of vexation at his\r\nown short-comings) with which my father used to receive the lists of\r\noversights, etc., which Professor Carus discovered in the course\r\nof translation. The connection was not a mere business one, but was\r\ncemented by warm feelings of regard on both sides.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO VICTOR CARUS. Down, November 10, 1866.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you for your extremely kind letter. I cannot express too\r\nstrongly my satisfaction that you have undertaken the revision of the\r\nnew edition, and I feel the honour which you have conferred on me. I\r\nfear that you will find the labour considerable, not only on account of\r\nthe additions, but I suspect that Bronn's translation is very defective,\r\nat least I have heard complaints on this head from quite a large number\r\nof persons. It would be a great gratification to me to know that the\r\ntranslation was a really good one, such as I have no doubt you will\r\nproduce. According to our English practice, you will be fully justified\r\nin entirely omitting Bronn's Appendix, and I shall be very glad of its\r\nomission. A new edition may be looked at as a new work... You could\r\nadd anything of your own that you liked, and I should be much pleased.\r\nShould you make any additions or append notes, it appears to me that\r\nNageli \"Entstehung und Begriff,\" etc. ('Entstehung und Begriff der\r\nNaturhistorischen Art.' An address given at a public meeting of the\r\n'R. Academy of Sciences' at Munich, March 28, 1865.), would be worth\r\nnoticing, as one of the most able pamphlets on the subject. I am,\r\nhowever, far from agreeing with him that the acquisition of certain\r\ncharacters which appear to be of no service to plants, offers any great\r\ndifficulty, or affords a proof of some innate tendency in plants towards\r\nperfection. If you intend to notice this pamphlet, I should like to\r\nwrite hereafter a little more in detail on the subject.\r\n\r\n... I wish I had known when writing my Historical Sketch that you had\r\nin 1853 published your views on the genealogical connection of past and\r\npresent forms.\r\n\r\nI suppose you have the sheets of the last English edition on which I\r\nmarked with pencil all the chief additions, but many little corrections\r\nof style were not marked.\r\n\r\nPray believe that I feel sincerely grateful for the great service and\r\nhonour which you do me by the present translation.\r\n\r\nI remain, my dear Sir, yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I should be VERY MUCH pleased to possess your photograph, and I\r\nsend mine in case you should like to have a copy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. NAGELI. (Professor of Botany at Munich.) Down, June\r\n12 [1866].\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI hope you will excuse the liberty which I take in writing to you. I\r\nhave just read, though imperfectly, your 'Entstehung und Begriff,'\r\nand have been so greatly interested by it, that I have sent it to be\r\ntranslated, as I am a poor German scholar. I have just finished a new\r\n[4th] edition of my 'Origin,' which will be translated into German,\r\nand my object in writing to you is to say that if you should see\r\nthis edition you would think that I had borrowed from you, without\r\nacknowledgment, two discussions on the beauty of flowers and fruit;\r\nbut I assure you every word was printed off before I had opened your\r\npamphlet. Should you like to possess a copy of either the German or\r\nEnglish new edition, I should be proud to send one. I may add, with\r\nrespect to the beauty of flowers, that I have already hinted the same\r\nviews as you hold in my paper on Lythrum.\r\n\r\nMany of your criticisms on my views are the best which I have met with,\r\nbut I could answer some, at least to my own satisfaction; and I regret\r\nextremely that I had not read your pamphlet before printing my new\r\nedition. On one or two points, I think, you have a little misunderstood\r\nme, though I dare say I have not been cautious in expressing myself. The\r\nremark which has struck me most, is that on the position of the leaves\r\nnot having been acquired through natural selection, from not being of\r\nany special importance to the plant. I well remember being formerly\r\ntroubled by an analogous difficulty, namely, the position of the ovules,\r\ntheir anatropous condition, etc. It was owing to forgetfulness that\r\nI did not notice this difficulty in the 'Origin.' (Nageli's Essay is\r\nnoticed in the 5th edition.) Although I can offer no explanation of such\r\nfacts, and only hope to see that they may be explained, yet I hardly see\r\nhow they support the doctrine of some law of necessary development,\r\nfor it is not clear to me that a plant, with its leaves placed at some\r\nparticular angle, or with its ovules in some particular position, thus\r\nstands higher than another plant. But I must apologise for troubling you\r\nwith these remarks.\r\n\r\nAs I much wish to possess your photograph, I take the liberty of\r\nenclosing my own, and with sincere respect I remain, dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours faithfully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[I give a few extracts from letters of various dates showing my\r\nfather's interest, alluded to in the last letter, in the problem of the\r\narrangement of the leaves on the stems of plants. It may be added that\r\nProfessor Schwendener of Berlin has successfully attacked the question\r\nin his 'Mechanische Theorie der Blattstellungen,' 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. FALCONER. August 26 [1863].\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember telling me that I ought to study Phyllotaxy? Well I\r\nhave often wished you at the bottom of the sea; for I could not resist,\r\nand I muddled my brains with diagrams, etc., and specimens, and made\r\nout, as might have been expected, nothing. Those angles are a most\r\nwonderful problem and I wish I could see some one give a rational\r\nexplanation of them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. ASA GRAY. May 11 [1861].\r\n\r\n\"If you wish to save me from a miserable death, do tell me why the\r\nangles 1/2, 1/3, 2/5, 3/8, etc, series occur, and no other angles.

Did you and some mathematician\r\n(Probably my father was thinking of Chauncey Wright's work on\r\nPhyllotaxy, in Gould's 'Astronomical Journal,' No.99, 1856, and in the\r\n'Mathematical Monthly,' 1859. These papers are mentioned in the \"Letters\r\nof Chauncey Wright.' Mr. Wright corresponded with my father on the\r\nsubject.) publish some paper on the subject? Hooker says you did; where\r\nis it?\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. ASA GRAY. [May 31, 1863?].\r\n\r\n\"I have been looking at Nageli's work on this subject, and am astonished\r\nto see that the angle is not always the same in young shoots when the\r\nlea-buds are first distinguishable, as in full-grown branches. This\r\nshows, I think, that there must be some potent cause for those angles\r\nwhich do occur: I dare say there is some explanation as simple as that\r\nfor the angles of the Bees-cells.\"\r\n\r\nMy father also corresponded with Dr. Hubert Airy and was interested in\r\nhis views on the subject, published in the Royal Soc. Proceedings, 1873,\r\npage 176.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now return to the year 1866.\r\n\r\nIn November, when the prosecution of Governor Eyre was dividing England\r\ninto two bitterly opposed parties, he wrote to Sir J. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"You will shriek at me when you hear that I have just subscribed to the\r\nJamaica Committee.\" (He subscribed 10 pounds.)\r\n\r\nOn this subject I quote from a letter of my brother's:--\r\n\r\n\"With respect to Governor Eyre's conduct in Jamaica, he felt strongly\r\nthat J.S. Mill was right in prosecuting him. I remember one evening, at\r\nmy Uncle's, we were talking on the subject, and as I happened to think\r\nit was too strong a measure to prosecute Governor Eyre for murder, I\r\nmade some foolish remark about the prosecutors spending the surplus of\r\nthe fund in a dinner. My father turned on me almost with fury, and told\r\nme, if those were my feelings, I had better go back to Southampton; the\r\ninhabitants having given a dinner to Governor Eyre on his landing, but\r\nwith which I had had nothing to do.\" The end of the incident, as told\r\nby my brother, is so characteristic of my father that I cannot resist\r\ngiving it, though it has no bearing on the point at issue. \"Next morning\r\nat 7 o'clock, or so, he came into my bedroom and sat on my bed, and said\r\nthat he had not been able to sleep from the thought that he had been so\r\nangry with me, and after a few more kind words he left me.\"\r\n\r\nThe same restless desire to correct a disagreeable or incorrect\r\nimpression is well illustrated in an extract which I quote from some\r\nnotes by Rev. J. Brodie Innes:--\r\n\r\n\"Allied to the extreme carefulness of observation was his most\r\nremarkable truthfulness in all matters. On one occasion, when a parish\r\nmeeting had been held on some disputed point of no great importance, I\r\nwas surprised by a visit from Mr. Darwin at night. He came to say that,\r\nthinking over the debate, though what he had said was quite accurate,\r\nhe thought I might have drawn an erroneous conclusion, and he would\r\nnot sleep till he had explained it. I believe that if on any day some\r\ncertain fact had come to his knowledge which contradicted his most\r\ncherished theories, he would have placed the fact on record for\r\npublication before he slept.\"\r\n\r\nThis tallies with my father's habits, as described by himself. When a\r\ndifficulty or an objection occurred to him, he thought it of paramount\r\nimportance to make a note of it instantly because he found hostile facts\r\nto be especially evanescent.\r\n\r\nThe same point is illustrated by the following incident, for which I am\r\nindebted to Mr. Romanes:--\r\n\r\n\"I have always remembered the following little incident as a good\r\nexample of Mr. Darwin's extreme solicitude on the score of accuracy. One\r\nevening at Down there was a general conversation upon the difficulty of\r\nexplaining the evolution of some of the distinctively human emotions,\r\nespecially those appertaining to the recognition of beauty in natural\r\nscenery. I suggested a view of my own upon the subject, which, depending\r\nupon the principle of association, required the supposition that a long\r\nline of ancestors should have inhabited regions, the scenery of which is\r\nnow regarded as beautiful. Just as I was about to observe that the chief\r\ndifficulty attaching to my hypothesis arose from feelings of the sublime\r\n(seeing that these are associated with awe, and might therefore be\r\nexpected not to be agreeable), Mr. Darwin anticipated the remark, by\r\nasking how the hypothesis was to meet the case of these feelings. In the\r\nconversation which followed, he said the occasion in his own life, when\r\nhe was most affected by the emotions of the sublime was when he stood\r\nupon one of the summits of the Cordillera, and surveyed the magnificent\r\nprospect all around. It seemed, as he quaintly observed, as if\r\nhis nerves had become fiddle strings, and had all taken to rapidly\r\nvibrating. This remark was only made incidentally, and the conversation\r\npassed into some other branch. About an hour afterwards Mr. Darwin\r\nretired to rest, while I sat up in the smoking-room with one of his\r\nsons. We continued smoking and talking for several hours, when at\r\nabout one o'clock in the morning the door gently opened and Mr.\r\nDarwin appeared, in his slippers and dressing-gown. As nearly as I can\r\nremember, the following are the words he used:--\r\n\r\n\"'Since I went to bed I have been thinking over our conversation in the\r\ndrawing-room, and it has just occurred to me that I was wrong in telling\r\nyou I felt most of the sublime when on the top of the Cordillera; I am\r\nquite sure that I felt it even more when in the forests of Brazil. I\r\nthought it best to come and tell you this at once in case I should\r\nbe putting you wrong. I am sure now that I felt most sublime in the\r\nforests.'\r\n\r\n\"This was all he had come to say, and it was evident that he had come to\r\ndo so, because he thought that the fact of his feeling 'most sublime in\r\nforests' was more in accordance with the hypothesis which we had been\r\ndiscussing, than the fact which he had previously stated. Now, as no one\r\nknew better than Mr. Darwin the difference between a speculation and a\r\nfact, I thought this little exhibition of scientific conscientiousness\r\nvery noteworthy, where the only question concerned was of so highly\r\nspeculative a character. I should not have been so much impressed if he\r\nhad thought that by his temporary failure of memory he had put me on a\r\nwrong scent in any matter of fact, although even in such a case he is\r\nthe only man I ever knew who would care to get out of bed at such a time\r\nat night in order to make the correction immediately, instead of waiting\r\ntill next morning. But as the correction only had reference to a flimsy\r\nhypothesis, I certainly was very much impressed by this display of\r\ncharacter.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 10 [1866].\r\n\r\n... I have now read the last No. of H. Spencer. ('Principles of\r\nBiology.') I do not know whether to think it better than the previous\r\nnumber, but it is wonderfully clever, and I dare say mostly true. I feel\r\nrather mean when I read him: I could bear, and rather enjoy feeling that\r\nhe was twice as ingenious and clever as myself, but when I feel that he\r\nis about a dozen times my superior, even in the master art of wriggling,\r\nI feel aggrieved. If he had trained himself to observe more, even if at\r\nthe expense, by the law of balancement, of some loss of thinking power,\r\nhe would have been a wonderful man.\r\n\r\n... I am HEARTILY glad you are taking up the Distribution of Plants in\r\nNew Zealand, and suppose it will make part of your new book. Your view,\r\nas I understand it, that New Zealand subsided and formed two or\r\nmore small islands, and then rose again, seems to me extremely\r\nprobable... When I puzzled my brains about New Zealand, I remember I came\r\nto the conclusion, as indeed I state in the 'Origin,' that its flora, as\r\nwell as that of other southern lands, had been tinctured by an Antarctic\r\nflora, which must have existed before the Glacial period. I concluded\r\nthat New Zealand never could have been closely connected with Australia,\r\nthough I supposed it had received some few Australian forms by\r\noccasional means of transport. Is there any reason to suppose that New\r\nZealand could have been more closely connected with South Australia\r\nduring the glacial period, when the Eucalypti, etc., might have been\r\ndriven further North? Apparently there remains only the line, which\r\nI think you suggested, of sunken islands from New Caledonia. Please\r\nremember that the Edwardsia was certainly drifted there by the sea.\r\n\r\nI remember in old days speculating on the amount of life, i.e. of\r\norganic chemical change, at different periods. There seems to me one\r\nvery difficult element in the problem, namely, the state of development\r\nof the organic beings at each period, for I presume that a Flora and\r\nFauna of cellular cryptogamic plants, of Protozoa and Radiata would lead\r\nto much less chemical change than is now going on. But I have scribbled\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter is in acknowledgment of Mr. Rivers' reply to\r\nan earlier letter in which my father had asked for information on\r\nbu-variation:\r\n\r\nIt may find a place here in illustration of the manner of my father's\r\nintercourse with those \"whose avocations in life had to do with the\r\nrearing or use of living things\" (\"Mr. Dyer in 'Charles Darwin,'\"\r\n\"Nature Series\", 1882, page 39.)--an intercourse which bore such good\r\nfruit in the 'Variation of Animals and Plants.' Mr. Dyer has some\r\nexcellent remarks on the unexpected value thus placed on apparently\r\ntrivial facts disinterred from weekly journals, or amassed by\r\ncorrespondence. He adds: \"Horticulturists who had... moulded plants\r\nalmost at their will at the impulse of taste or profit were at once\r\namazed and charmed to find that they had been doing scientific work and\r\nhelping to establish a great theory.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T. RIVERS. (The late Mr. Rivers was an eminent\r\nhorticulturist and writer on horticulture.) Down, December 28 [1866?].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nPermit me to thank you cordially for your most kind letter. For years\r\nI have read with interest every scrap which you have written in\r\nperiodicals, and abstracted in MS. your book on Roses, and several times\r\nI thought I would write to you, but did not know whether you would think\r\nme too intrusive. I shall, indeed, be truly obliged for any information\r\nyou can supply me on bud-variation or sports. When any extra\r\ndifficult points occur to me in my present subject (which is a mass of\r\ndifficulties), I will apply to you, but I will not be unreasonable. It\r\nis most true what you say that any one to study well the physiology of\r\nthe life of plants, ought to have under his eye a multitude of plants.\r\nI have endeavoured to do what I can by comparing statements by many\r\nwriters and observing what I could myself. Unfortunately few have\r\nobserved like you have done. As you are so kind, I will mention one\r\nother point on which I am collecting facts; namely, the effect produced\r\non the stock by the graft; thus, it is SAID, that the purple-leaved\r\nfilbert affects the leaves of the common hazel on which it is grafted (I\r\nhave just procured a plant to try), so variegated jessamine is SAID\r\nto affect its stock. I want these facts partly to throw light on the\r\nmarvellous laburnum Adami, trifacial oranges, etc. That laburnum case\r\nseems one of the strangest in physiology. I have now growing splendid,\r\nFERTILE, yellow laburnums (with a long raceme like the so-called\r\nWaterer's laburnum) from seed of yellow flowers on the C. Adami. To a\r\nman like myself, who is compelled to live a solitary life, and sees few\r\npersons, it is no slight satisfaction to hear that I have been able at\r\nall [to] interest by my books observers like yourself.\r\n\r\nAs I shall publish on my present subject, I presume, within a year, it\r\nwill be of no use your sending me the shoots of peaches and nectarines\r\nwhich you so kindly offer; I have recorded your facts.\r\n\r\nPermit me again to thank you cordially; I have not often in my life\r\nreceived a kinder letter.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, yours sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.V. -- THE PUBLICATION OF THE 'VARIATION OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS UNDER DOMESTICATION.'\r\n\r\nJANUARY 1867, TO JUNE 1868.\r\n\r\n[At the beginning of the year 1867 he was at work on the final\r\nchapter--\"Concluding Remarks\" of the 'Variation of Animals and Plants\r\nunder Domestication,' which was begun after the rest of the MS. had\r\nbeen sent to the printers in the preceding December. With regard to the\r\npublication of the book he wrote to Mr. Murray, on January 3:--\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you how sorry I am to hear of the enormous size of my\r\nbook. (On January 9 he wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker: \"I have been these last\r\nfew days vexed and annoyed to a foolish degree by hearing that my MS.\r\non Dom. An. and Cult. Plants will make 2 volumes, both bigger than\r\nthe 'Origin.' The volumes will have to be full-sized octavo, so I have\r\nwritten to Murray to suggest details to be printed in small type. But I\r\nfeel that the size is quite ludicrous in relation to the subject. I am\r\nready to swear at myself and at every fool who writes a book.\") I fear\r\nit can never pay. But I cannot shorten it now; nor, indeed, if I had\r\nforeseen its length, do I see which parts ought to have been omitted.\r\n\r\n\"If you are afraid to publish it, say so at once, I beg you, and I will\r\nconsider your note as cancelled. If you think fit, get any one whose\r\njudgment you rely on, to look over some of the more legible chapters,\r\nnamely, the Introduction, and on dogs and plants, the latter chapters\r\nbeing in my opinion, the dullest in the book... The list of chapters, and\r\nthe inspection of a few here and there, would give a good judge a fair\r\nidea of the whole book. Pray do not publish blindly, as it would vex me\r\nall my life if I led you to heavy loss.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Murray referred the MS. to a literary friend, and, in spite of\r\na somewhat adverse opinion, willingly agreed to publish the book. My\r\nfather wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"Your note has been a great relief to me. I am rather alarmed about the\r\nverdict of your friend, as he is not a man of science. I think if you\r\nhad sent the 'Origin' to an unscientific man, he would have utterly\r\ncondemned it. I am, however, VERY GLAD that you have consulted any one\r\non whom you can rely.\r\n\r\n\"I must add, that my 'Journal of Researches' was seen in MS. by an\r\neminent semi-scientific man, and was pronounced unfit for publication.\"\r\n\r\nThe proofs were begun in March, and the last revise was finished on\r\nNovember 15th, and during this period the only intervals of rest were\r\ntwo visits of a week each at his brother Erasmus's house in Queen Anne\r\nStreet. He notes in his Diary:--\r\n\r\n\"I began this book [in the] beginning of 1860 (and then had some MS.),\r\nbut owing to interruptions from my illness, and illness of children;\r\nfrom various editions of the 'Origin,' and Papers, especially Orchis\r\nbook and Tendrils, I have spent four years and two months over it.\"\r\n\r\nThe edition of 'Animals and Plants' was of 1500 copies, and of these\r\n1260 were sold at Mr. Murray's autumnal sale, but it was not published\r\nuntil January 30, 1868. A new edition of 1250 copies was printed in\r\nFebruary of the same year.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 he received the distinction of being made a knight of the\r\nPrussian Order \"Pour le Merite.\" (The Order \"Pour le Merite\" was\r\nfounded in 1740 by Frederick II. by the re-christening of an \"Order\r\nof Generosity,\" founded in 1665. It was at one time strictly military,\r\nhaving been previously both civil and military, and in 1840 the Order\r\nwas again opened to civilians. The order consists of thirty members of\r\nGerman extraction, but distinguished foreigners are admitted to a kind\r\nof extraordinary membership. Faraday, Herschel, and Thomas Moore, have\r\nbelonged to it in this way. From the thirty members a chancellor is\r\nelected by the king (the first officer of this kind was Alexander v.\r\nHumboldt); and it is the duty of the chancellor to notify a vacancy in\r\nthe Order to the remainder of the thirty, who then elect by vote the new\r\nmember--but the king has technically the appointment in his own hands.)\r\nHe seems not to have known how great the distinction was, for in June\r\n1868 he wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"What a man you are for sympathy. I was made \"Eques\" some months ago,\r\nbut did not think much about it. Now, by Jove, we all do; but you, in\r\nfact, have knighted me.\"\r\n\r\nThe letters may now take up the story.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, February 8 [1867].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI am heartily glad that you have been offered the Presidentship of the\r\nBritish Association, for it is a great honour, and as you have so\r\nmuch work to do, I am equally glad that you have declined it. I feel,\r\nhowever, convinced that you would have succeeded very well; but if I\r\nfancy myself in such a position, it actually makes my blood run cold. I\r\nlook back with amazement at the skill and taste with which the Duke of\r\nArgyll made a multitude of little speeches at Glasgow. By the way,\r\nI have not seen the Duke's book ('The Reign of Law,' 1867.), but I\r\nformerly thought that some of the articles which appeared in periodicals\r\nwere very clever, but not very profound. One of these was reviewed\r\nin the \"Saturday Review\" (\"Saturday Review\", November 15, 1862, 'The\r\n\"Edinburgh Review\" on the Supernatural.' Written by my cousin, Mr.\r\nHenry Parker.) some years ago, and the fallacy of some main argument\r\nwas admirably exposed, and I sent the article to you, and you agreed\r\nstrongly with it... There was the other day a rather good review of the\r\nDuke's book in the \"Spectator\", and with a new explanation, either by\r\nthe Duke or the reviewer (I could not make out which), of rudimentary\r\norgans, namely, that economy of labour and material was a great guiding\r\nprinciple with God (ignoring waste of seed and of young monsters, etc.),\r\nand that making a new plan for the structure of animals was thought, and\r\nthought was labour, and therefore God kept to a uniform plan, and left\r\nrudiments. This is no exaggeration. In short, God is a man, rather\r\ncleverer than us... I am very much obliged for the \"Nation\" (returned by\r\nthis post); it is ADMIRABLY good. You say I always guess wrong, but I do\r\nnot believe any one, except Asa Gray, could have done the thing so well.\r\nI would bet even, or three to two, that it is Asa Gray, though one or\r\ntwo passages staggered me.\r\n\r\nI finish my book on 'Domestic Animals,' etc., by a single paragraph,\r\nanswering, or rather throwing doubt, in so far as so little space\r\npermits, on Asa Gray's doctrine that each variation has been specially\r\nordered or led along a beneficial line. It is foolish to touch such\r\nsubjects, but there have been so many allusions to what I think about\r\nthe part which God has played in the formation of organic beings (Prof.\r\nJudd allows me to quote from some notes which he has kindly given\r\nme:--\"Lyell once told me that he had frequently been asked if Darwin was\r\nnot one of the most unhappy of men, it being suggested that his outrage\r\nupon public opinion should have filled him with remorse.\" Sir Charles\r\nLyell must have been able, I think, to give a satisfactory answer on\r\nthis point. Professor Judd continues:--\r\n\r\n\"I made a note of this and other conversations of Lyell's at the time.\r\nAt the present time such statements must appear strange to any one\r\nwho does not recollect the revolution in opinion which has taken place\r\nduring the last 23 years [1882].\"), that I thought it shabby to evade\r\nthe question... I have even received several letters on the subject... I\r\noverlooked your sentence about Providence, and suppose I treated it as\r\nBuckland did his own theology, when his Bridgewater Treatise was read\r\naloud to him for correction...\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter, from Mrs. Boole, is one of those referred to in\r\nthe last letter to Sir J.D. Hooker:]\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nWill you excuse my venturing to ask you a question, to which no one's\r\nanswer but your own would be quite satisfactory?\r\n\r\nDo you consider the holding of your theory of Natural Selection, in its\r\nfullest and most unreserved sense, to be inconsistent--I do not say with\r\nany particular scheme of theological doctrine--but with the following\r\nbelief, namely:--\r\n\r\nThat knowledge is given to man by the direct inspiration of the Spirit\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nThat God is a personal and Infinitely good Being.\r\n\r\nThat the effect of the action of the Spirit of God on the brain of man\r\nis especially a moral effect.\r\n\r\nAnd that each individual man has within certain limits a power of choice\r\nas to how far he will yield to his hereditary animal impulses, and how\r\nfar he will rather follow the guidance of the Spirit, who is educating\r\nhim into a power of resisting those impulses in obedience to moral\r\nmotives?\r\n\r\nThe reason why I ask you is this: my own impression has always been, not\r\nonly that your theory was perfectly COMPATIBLE with the faith to which\r\nI have just tried to give expression, but that your books afforded me\r\na clue which would guide me in applying that faith to the solution of\r\ncertain complicated psychological problems which it was of practical\r\nimportance to me as a mother to solve. I felt that you had supplied one\r\nof the missing links--not to say THE missing link--between the facts of\r\nscience and the promises of religion. Every year's experience tends to\r\ndeepen in me that impression.\r\n\r\nBut I have lately read remarks on the probable bearing of your theory on\r\nreligious and moral questions which have perplexed and pained me sorely.\r\nI know that the persons who make such remarks must be cleverer and wiser\r\nthan myself. I cannot feel sure that they are mistaken, unless you will\r\ntell me so. And I think--I cannot know for certain--but I THINK--that if\r\nI were an author, I would rather that the humblest student of my works\r\nshould apply to me directly in a difficulty, than that she should puzzle\r\ntoo long over adverse and probably mistaken or thoughtless criticisms.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I feel that you have a perfect right to refuse to\r\nanswer such questions as I have asked you. Science must take her\r\npath, and Theology hers, and they will meet when and where and how God\r\npleases, and you are in no sense responsible for it if the meeting-point\r\nshould still be very far off. If I receive no answer to this letter I\r\nshall infer nothing from your silence, except that you felt I had no\r\nright to make such enquiries of a stranger.\r\n\r\n[My father replied as follows:]\r\n\r\nDown, December 14, [1866].\r\n\r\nDear Madam,\r\n\r\nIt would have gratified me much if I could have sent satisfactory\r\nanswers to your questions, or, indeed, answers of any kind. But I cannot\r\nsee how the belief that all organic beings, including man, have been\r\ngenetically derived from some simple being, instead of having been\r\nseparately created, bears on your difficulties. These, as it seems to\r\nme, can be answered only by widely different evidence from science, or\r\nby the so-called \"inner consciousness.\" My opinion is not worth more\r\nthan that of any other man who has thought on such subjects, and it\r\nwould be folly in me to give it. I may, however, remark that it has\r\nalways appeared to me more satisfactory to look at the immense amount of\r\npain and suffering in this world as the inevitable result of the natural\r\nsequence of events, i.e. general laws, rather than from the direct\r\nintervention of God, though I am aware this is not logical with\r\nreference to an omniscient Deity. Your last question seems to resolve\r\nitself into the problem of free will and necessity, which has been found\r\nby most persons insoluble. I sincerely wish that this note had not been\r\nas utterly valueless as it is. I would have sent full answers, though I\r\nhave little time or strength to spare, had it been in my power. I have\r\nthe honour to remain, dear Madam,\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I am grieved that my views should incidentally have caused trouble\r\nto your mind, but I thank you for your judgment, and honour you for it,\r\nthat theology and science should each run its own course, and that in\r\nthe present case I am not responsible if their meeting-point should\r\nstill be far off.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The next letter discusses the 'Reign of Law,' referred to a few pages\r\nback:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, June 1 [1867].\r\n\r\n... I am at present reading the Duke, and am VERY MUCH interested by him;\r\nyet I cannot but think, clever as the whole is, that parts are weak, as\r\nwhen he doubts whether each curvature of the beak of humming-birds is of\r\nservice to each species. He admits, perhaps too fully, that I have shown\r\nthe use of each little ridge and shape of each petal in orchids, and how\r\nstrange he does not extend the view to humming-birds. Still odder, it\r\nseems to me, all that he says on beauty, which I should have thought a\r\nnonentity, except in the mind of some sentient being. He might have as\r\nwell said that love existed during the secondary or Palaeozoic periods.\r\nI hope you are getting on with your book better than I am with mine,\r\nwhich kills me with the labour of correcting, and is intolerably dull,\r\nthough I did not think so when I was writing it. A naturalist's life\r\nwould be a happy one if he had only to observe, and never to write.\r\n\r\nWe shall be in London for a week in about a fortnight's time, and I\r\nshall enjoy having a breakfast talk with you.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter refers to the new and improved translation of the\r\n'Origin,' undertaken by Professor Carus:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J. VICTOR CARUS. Down, February 17 [1867].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have read your preface with care. It seems to me that you have treated\r\nBronn with complete respect and great delicacy, and that you have\r\nalluded to your own labour with much modesty. I do not think that any of\r\nBronn's friends can complain of what you say and what you have done. For\r\nmy own sake, I grieve that you have not added notes, as I am sure that\r\nI should have profited much by them; but as you have omitted Bronn's\r\nobjections, I believe that you have acted with excellent judgment and\r\nfairness in leaving the text without comment to the independent verdict\r\nof the reader. I heartily congratulate you that the main part of your\r\nlabour is over; it would have been to most men a very troublesome task,\r\nbut you seem to have indomitable powers of work, judging from those two\r\nwonderful and most useful volumes on zoological literature ('Bibliotheca\r\nZoologica,' 1861.) edited by you, and which I never open without\r\nsurprise at their accuracy, and gratitude for their usefulness. I cannot\r\nsufficiently tell you how much I rejoice that you were persuaded to\r\nsuperintend the translation of the present edition of my book, for I\r\nhave now the great satisfaction of knowing that the German public can\r\njudge fairly of its merits and demerits...\r\n\r\nWith my cordial and sincere thanks, believe me,\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, yours very faithfully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The earliest letter which I have seen from my father to Professor\r\nHaeckel, was written in 1865, and from that time forward they\r\ncorresponded (though not, I think, with any regularity) up to the end of\r\nmy father's life. His friendship with Haeckel was not nearly growth of\r\ncorrespondence, as was the case with some others, for instance, Fritz\r\nMuller. Haeckel paid more than one visit to Down, and these were\r\nthoroughly enjoyed by my father. The following letter will serve to\r\nshow the strong feeling of regard which he entertained for his\r\ncorrespondent--a feeling which I have often heard him emphatically\r\nexpress, and which was warmly returned. The book referred to is\r\nHaeckel's 'Generelle Morphologie,' published in 1866, a copy of which my\r\nfather received from the author in January 1867.\r\n\r\nDr. E. Krause ('Charles Darwin und sein Verhaltniss zu Deutschland,'\r\n1885.) has given a good account of Professor Haeckel's services to the\r\ncause of Evolution. After speaking of the lukewarm reception which the\r\n'Origin' met with in Germany on its first publication, he goes on to\r\ndescribe the first adherents of the new faith as more or less popular\r\nwriters, not especially likely to advance its acceptance with the\r\nprofessorial or purely scientific world. And he claims for Haeckel that\r\nit was his advocacy of Evolution in his 'Radiolaria' (1862), and at\r\nthe \"Versammlung\" of Naturalists at Stettin in 1863, that placed the\r\nDarwinian question for the first time publicly before the forum\r\nof German science, and his enthusiastic propagandism that chiefly\r\ncontributed to its success.\r\n\r\nMr. Huxley, writing in 1869, paid a high tribute to Professor Haeckel as\r\nthe Coryphaeus of the Darwinian movement in Germany. Of his 'Generelle\r\nMorphologie,' \"an attempt to work out the practical application\" of the\r\ndoctrine of Evolution to their final results, he says that it has the\r\n\"force and suggestiveness, and... systematising power of Oken without his\r\nextravagance.\" Professor Huxley also testifies to the value of Haeckel's\r\n'Schopfungs-Geschichte' as an exposition of the 'Generelle Morphologie'\r\n\"for an educated public.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in his 'Evolution in Biology' (An article in the 'Encyclopaedia\r\nBritannica,' 9th edition, reprinted in 'Science and Culture,' 1881, page\r\n298.), Mr. Huxley wrote: \"Whatever hesitation may, not unfrequently,\r\nbe felt by less daring minds, in following Haeckel in many of his\r\nspeculations, his attempt to systematise the doctrine of Evolution,\r\nand to exhibit its influence as the central thought of modern biology,\r\ncannot fail to have a far-reaching influence on the progress of\r\nscience.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following letter my father alludes to the somewhat fierce manner\r\nin which Professor Haeckel fought the battle of 'Darwinismus,' and\r\non this subject Dr. Krause has some good remarks (page 162). He asks\r\nwhether much that happened in the heat of the conflict might not well\r\nhave been otherwise, and adds that Haeckel himself is the last man to\r\ndeny this. Nevertheless he thinks that even these things may have worked\r\nwell for the cause of Evolution, inasmuch as Haeckel \"concentrated\r\non himself by his 'Ursprung des Menschen-Geschlechts,' his 'Generelle\r\nMorphologie,' and 'Schopfungs-Geschichte,' all the hatred and\r\nbitterness which Evolution excited in certain quarters,\" so that, \"in\r\na surprisingly short time it became the fashion in Germany that Haeckel\r\nalone should be abused, while Darwin was held up as the ideal of\r\nforethought and moderation.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO E. HAECKEL. Down, May 21, 1867.\r\n\r\nDear Haeckel,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 18th has given me great pleasure, for you have\r\nreceived what I said in the most kind and cordial manner. You have\r\nin part taken what I said much stronger than I had intended. It never\r\noccurred to me for a moment to doubt that your work, with the whole\r\nsubject so admirably and clearly arranged, as well as fortified by so\r\nmany new facts and arguments, would not advance our common object in the\r\nhighest degree. All that I think is that you will excite anger, and that\r\nanger so completely blinds every one, that your arguments would have\r\nno chance of influencing those who are already opposed to our views.\r\nMoreover, I do not at all like that you, towards whom I feel so much\r\nfriendship, should unnecessarily make enemies, and there is pain and\r\nvexation enough in the world without more being caused. But I repeat\r\nthat I can feel no doubt that your work will greatly advance our\r\nsubject, and I heartily wish it could be translated into English, for\r\nmy own sake and that of others. With respect to what you say about\r\nmy advancing too strongly objections against my own views, some of\r\nmy English friends think that I have erred on this side; but truth\r\ncompelled me to write what I did, and I am inclined to think it was good\r\npolicy. The belief in the descent theory is slowly spreading in England\r\n(In October 1867 he wrote to Mr. Wallace:--\"Mr. Warrington has lately\r\nread an excellent and spirited abstract of the 'Origin' before the\r\nVictoria Institute, and as this is a most orthodox body, he has gained\r\nthe name of the Devil's Advocate. The discussion which followed during\r\nthree consecutive meetings is very rich from the nonsense talked. If you\r\nwould care to see the number I could send it you.\"), even amongst those\r\nwho can give no reason for their belief. No body of men were at first\r\nso much opposed to my views as the members of the London Entomological\r\nSociety, but now I am assured that, with the exception of two or three\r\nold men, all the members concur with me to a certain extent. It has been\r\na great disappointment to me that I have never received your long letter\r\nwritten to me from the Canary Islands. I am rejoiced to hear that your\r\ntour, which seems to have been a most interesting one, has done your\r\nhealth much good. I am working away at my new book, but make very slow\r\nprogress, and the work tries my health, which is much the same as when\r\nyou were here.\r\n\r\nVictor Carus is going to translate it, but whether it is worth\r\ntranslation, I am rather doubtful. I am very glad to hear that there is\r\nsome chance of your visiting England this autumn, and all in this house\r\nwill be delighted to see you here.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Haeckel, Yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO F. MULLER. Down, July 31 [1867].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received a week ago your letter of June 2, full as usual of valuable\r\nmatter and specimens. It arrived at exactly the right time, for I was\r\nenabled to give a pretty full abstract of your observations on the\r\nplant's own pollen being poisonous. I have inserted this abstract in the\r\nproo-sheets in my chapter on sterility, and it forms the most striking\r\npart of my whole chapter. (In 'The Variation of Animals and Plants.') I\r\nthank you very sincerely for the most interesting observations, which,\r\nhowever, I regret that you did not publish independently. I have been\r\nforced to abbreviate one or two parts more than I wished... Your letters\r\nalways surprise me, from the number of points to which you attend. I\r\nwish I could make my letters of any interest to you, for I hardly ever\r\nsee a naturalist, and live as retired a life as you in Brazil. With\r\nrespect to mimetic plants, I remember Hooker many years ago saying he\r\nbelieved that there were many, but I agree with you that it would\r\nbe most difficult to distinguish between mimetic resemblance and the\r\neffects of peculiar conditions. Who can say to which of these causes to\r\nattribute the several plants with heath-like foliage at the Cape of Good\r\nHope? Is it not also a difficulty that quadrupeds appear to recognise\r\nplants more by their [scent] than their appearance? What I have just\r\nsaid reminds me to ask you a question. Sir J. Lubbock brought me the\r\nother day what appears to be a terrestrial Planaria (the first ever\r\nfound in the northern hemisphere) and which was coloured exactly like\r\nour dark-coloured slugs. Now slugs are not devoured by birds, like\r\nthe shell-bearing species, and this made me remember that I found the\r\nBrazilian Planariae actually together with striped Vaginuli which I\r\nbelieve were similarly coloured. Can you throw any light on this? I wish\r\nto know, because I was puzzled some months ago how it would be possible\r\nto account for the bright colours of the Planariae in reference to\r\nsexual selection. By the way, I suppose they are hermaphrodites.\r\n\r\nDo not forget to aid me, if in your power, with answers to ANY of my\r\nquestions on expression, for the subject interests me greatly. With\r\ncordial thanks for your never-failing kindness, believe me,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, July 18 [1867].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your long letter. I am sorry to hear that you are in\r\ndespair about your book (The 2nd volume of the 10th Edition of the\r\n'Principles.'); I well know that feeling, but am now getting out of the\r\nlower depths. I shall be very much pleased, if you can make the least\r\nuse of my present book, and do not care at all whether it is published\r\nbefore yours. Mine will appear towards the end of November of this year;\r\nyou speak of yours as not coming out till November, 1868, which I\r\nhope may be an error. There is nothing about Man in my book which can\r\ninterfere with you, so I will order all the completed clean sheets to be\r\nsent (and others as soon as ready) to you, but please observe you will\r\nnot care for the first volume, which is a mere record of the amount\r\nof variation; but I hope the second will be somewhat more interesting.\r\nThough I fear the whole must be dull.\r\n\r\nI rejoice from my heart that you are going to speak out plainly about\r\nspecies. My book about Man, if published, will be short, and a large\r\nportion will be devoted to sexual selection, to which subject I alluded\r\nin the 'Origin' as bearing on Man...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, August 22 [1867].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI thank you cordially for your last two letters. The former one did me\r\nREAL good, for I had got so wearied with the subject that I could hardly\r\nbear to correct the proofs (The proofs of 'Animals and Plants,' which\r\nLyell was then reading.), and you gave me fresh heart. I remember\r\nthinking that when you came to the Pigeon chapter you would pass it over\r\nas quite unreadable. Your last letter has interested me in very many\r\nways, and I have been glad to hear about those horrid unbelieving\r\nFrenchmen. I have been particularly pleased that you have noticed\r\nPangenesis. I do not know whether you ever had the feeling of having\r\nthought so much over a subject that you had lost all power of judging\r\nit. This is my case with Pangenesis (which is 26 or 27 years old), but I\r\nam inclined to think that if it be admitted as a probable hypothesis it\r\nwill be a somewhat important step in Biology.\r\n\r\nI cannot help still regretting that you have ever looked at the slips,\r\nfor I hope to improve the whole a good deal. It is surprising to me,\r\nand delightful, that you should care in the least about the plants.\r\nAltogether you have given me one of the best cordials I ever had in my\r\nlife, and I heartily thank you. I despatched this morning the French\r\nedition. (Of the 'Origin.' It appears that my father was sending a copy\r\nof the French edition to Sir Charles. The introduction was by Mdlle.\r\nRoyer, who translated the book.) The introduction was a complete\r\nsurprise to me, and I dare say has injured the book in France;\r\nnevertheless... it shows, I think, that the woman is uncommonly clever.\r\nOnce again many thanks for the renewed courage with which I shall attack\r\nthe horrid proof-sheets.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--A Russian who is translating my new book into Russian has been\r\nhere, and says you are immensely read in Russia, and many editions--how\r\nmany I forget. Six editions of Buckle and four editions of the 'Origin.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, October 16 [1867].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI send by this post clean sheets of Volume I. up to page 336, and there\r\nare only 411 pages in this volume. I am VERY glad to hear that you are\r\ngoing to review my book; but if the \"Nation\" (The book was reviewed by\r\nDr. Gray in the \"Nation\", March 19, 1868.) is a newspaper I wish it\r\nwere at the bottom of the sea, for I fear that you will thus be stopped\r\nreviewing me in a scientific journal. The first volume is all details,\r\nand you will not be able to read it; and you must remember that the\r\nchapters on plants are written for naturalists who are not botanists.\r\nThe last chapter in Volume I. is, however, I think, a curious\r\ncompilation of facts; it is on bu-variation. In Volume II. some of the\r\nchapters are more interesting; and I shall be very curious to hear your\r\nverdict on the chapter on close inte-breeding. The chapter on what I\r\ncall Pangenesis will be called a mad dream, and I shall be pretty well\r\nsatisfied if you think it a dream worth publishing; but at the bottom of\r\nmy own mind I think it contains a great truth. I finish my book with a\r\nsemi-theological paragraph, in which I quote and differ from you; what\r\nyou will think of it, I know not...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 17 [1867].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nCongratulate me, for I have finished the last revise of the last sheet\r\nof my book. It has been an awful job: seven and a half months correcting\r\nthe press: the book, from much small type, does not look big, but is\r\nreally very big. I have had hard work to keep up to the mark, but during\r\nthe last week only few revises came, so that I have rested and feel more\r\nmyself. Hence, after our long mutual silence, I enjoy myself by writing\r\na note to you, for the sake of exhaling, and hearing from you. On\r\naccount of the index (The index was made by Mr. W.S. Dallas; I have\r\noften heard my father express his admiration of this excellent piece of\r\nwork.), I do not suppose that you will receive your copy till the middle\r\nof next month. I shall be intensely anxious to hear what you think\r\nabout Pangenesis; though I can see how fearfully imperfect, even in mere\r\nconjectural conclusions, it is; yet it has been an infinite satisfaction\r\nto me somehow to connect the various large groups of facts, which I\r\nhave long considered, by an intelligible thread. I shall not be at all\r\nsurprised if you attack it and me with unparalleled ferocity. It will\r\nbe my endeavour to do as little as possible for some time, but [I] shall\r\nsoon prepare a paper or two for the Linnean Society. In a short time we\r\nshall go to London for ten days, but the time is not yet fixed. Now I\r\nhave told you a deal about myself, and do let me hear a good deal\r\nabout your own past and future doings. Can you pay us a visit, early in\r\nDecember?... I have seen no one for an age, and heard no news.\r\n\r\n... About my book I will give you a bit of advice. Skip the WHOLE of\r\nVolume I., except the last chapter (and that need only be skimmed) and\r\nskip largely in the 2nd volume; and then you will say it is a very good\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\r\n1868.\r\n\r\n['The Variation of Animals and Plants' was, as already mentioned,\r\npublished on January 30, 1868, and on that day he sent a copy to Fritz\r\nMuller, and wrote to him:--\r\n\r\n\"I send by this post, by French packet, my new book, the publication of\r\nwhich has been much delayed. The greater part, as you will see, is not\r\nmeant to be read; but I should very much like to hear what you think\r\nof 'Pangenesis,' though I fear it will appear to EVERY ONE far too\r\nspeculative.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. February 3 [1868].\r\n\r\n... I am very much pleased at what you say about my Introduction; after\r\nit was in type I was as near as possible cancelling the whole. I have\r\nbeen for some time in despair about my book, and if I try to read a few\r\npages I feel fairly nauseated, but do not let this make you praise it;\r\nfor I have made up my mind that it is not worth a fifth part of the\r\nenormous labour it has cost me. I assure you that all that is worth your\r\ndoing (if you have time for so much) is glancing at Chapter VI., and\r\nreading parts of the later chapters. The facts on self-impotent plants\r\nseem to me curious, and I have worked out to my own satisfaction the\r\ngood from crossing and evil from interbreeding. I did read Pangenesis\r\nthe other evening, but even this, my beloved child, as I had fancied,\r\nquite disgusted me. The devil take the whole book; and yet now I am at\r\nwork again as hard as I am able. It is really a great evil that from\r\nhabit I have pleasure in hardly anything except Natural History, for\r\nnothing else makes me forget my eve-recurrent uncomfortable sensations.\r\nBut I must not howl any more, and the critics may say what they like;\r\nI did my best, and man can do no more. What a splendid pursuit Natural\r\nHistory would be if it was all observing and no writing!...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, February 10 [1868].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nWhat is the good of having a friend, if one may not boast to him? I\r\nheard yesterday that Murray has sold in a week the whole edition of\r\n1500 copies of my book, and the sale so pressing that he has agreed with\r\nClowes to get another edition in fourteen days! This has done me a world\r\nof good, for I had got into a sort of dogged hatred of my book. And\r\nnow there has appeared a review in the \"Pall Mall\" which has pleased me\r\nexcessively, more perhaps than is reasonable. I am quite content, and\r\ndo not care how much I may be pitched into. If by any chance you should\r\nhear who wrote the article in the \"Pall Mall\", do please tell me; it\r\nis some one who writes capitally, and who knows the subject. I went to\r\nluncheon on Sunday, to Lubbock's, partly in hopes of seeing you, and, be\r\nhanged to you, you were not there.\r\n\r\nYour cock-a-hoop friend, C.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Independently of the favourable tone of the able series of notices in\r\nthe \"Pall Mall Gazette\" (February 10, 15, 17, 1868), my father may well\r\nhave been gratified by the following passages:--\r\n\r\n\"We must call attention to the rare and noble calmness with which he\r\nexpounds his own views, undisturbed by the heats of polemical agitation\r\nwhich those views have excited, and persistently refusing to retort on\r\nhis antagonists by ridicule, by indignation, or by contempt. Considering\r\nthe amount of vituperation and insinuation which has come from the other\r\nside, this forbearance is supremely dignified.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again in the third notice, February 17:--\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere has the author a word that could wound the most sensitive\r\nsel-love of an antagonist; nowhere does he, in text or note, expose the\r\nfallacies and mistakes of brother investigators... but while abstaining\r\nfrom impertinent censure, he is lavish in acknowledging the smallest\r\ndebts he may owe; and his book will make many men happy.\"\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Messrs. Smith & Elder for the information that these\r\narticles were written by Mr. G.H. Lewes.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, February 23 [1868].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have had almost as many letters to write of late as you can have, viz.\r\nfrom 8 to 10 per diem, chiefly getting up facts on sexual selection,\r\ntherefore I have felt no inclination to write to you, and now I mean to\r\nwrite solely about my book for my own satisfaction, and not at all for\r\nyours. The first edition was 1500 copies, and now the second is\r\nprinted off; sharp work. Did you look at the review in the \"Athenaeum\"\r\n(\"Athenaeum\", February 15, 1868. My father quoted Pouchet's assertion\r\nthat \"variation under domestication throws no light on the natural\r\nmodification of species.\" The reviewer quotes the end of a passage\r\nin which my father declares that he can see no force in Pouchet's\r\narguments, or rather assertions, and then goes on: \"We are sadly\r\nmistaken if there are not clear proofs in the pages of the book before\r\nus that, on the contrary, Mr. Darwin has perceived, felt, and yielded to\r\nthe force of the arguments or assertions of his French antagonist.\" The\r\nfollowing may serve as samples of the rest of the review:--\r\n\r\n\"Henceforth the rhetoricians will have a better illustration of\r\nanti-climax than the mountain which brought forth a mouse,... in the\r\ndiscoverer of the origin of species, who tried to explain the variation\r\nof pigeons!\r\n\r\n\"A few summary words. On the 'Origin of Species' Mr. Darwin has\r\nnothing, and is never likely to have anything, to say; but on the vastly\r\nimportant subject of inheritance, the transmission of peculiarities\r\nonce acquired through successive generations, this work is a valuable\r\nstore-house of facts for curious students and practical breeders.\"),\r\nshowing profound contempt of me?... It is a shame that he should have\r\nsaid that I have taken much from Pouchet, without acknowledgment; for I\r\ntook literally nothing, there being nothing to take. There is a capital\r\nreview in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" which will sell the book if\r\nanything will. I don't quite see whether I or the writer is in a\r\nmuddle about man CAUSING variability. If a man drops a bit of iron into\r\nsulphuric acid he does not cause the affinities to come into play, yet\r\nhe may be said to make sulphate of iron. I do not know how to avoid\r\nambiguity.\r\n\r\nAfter what the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" and the \"Chronicle\" have said I do\r\nnot care a d--.\r\n\r\nI fear Pangenesis is stillborn; Bates says he has read it twice, and\r\nis not sure that he understands it. H. Spencer says the view is quite\r\ndifferent from his (and this is a great relief to me, as I feared to be\r\naccused of plagiarism, but utterly failed to be sure what he meant, so\r\nthought it safest to give my view as almost the same as his), and he\r\nsays he is not sure he understands it... Am I not a poor devil? yet I\r\ntook such pains, I must think that I expressed myself clearly. Old Sir\r\nH. Holland says he has read it twice, and thinks it very tough; but\r\nbelieves that sooner or later \"some view akin to it\" will be accepted.\r\n\r\nYou will think me very self-sufficient, when I declare that I feel SURE\r\nif Pangenesis is now stillborn it will, thank God, at some future time\r\nreappear, begotten by some other father, and christened by some other\r\nname.\r\n\r\nHave you ever met with any tangible and clear view of what takes place\r\nin generation, whether by seeds or buds, or how a long-lost character\r\ncan possibly reappear; or how the male element can possibly affect\r\nthe mother plant, or the mother animal, so that her future progeny are\r\naffected? Now all these points and many others are connected together,\r\nwhether truly or falsely is another question, by Pangenesis. You see I\r\ndie hard, and stick up for my poor child.\r\n\r\nThis letter is written for my own satisfaction, and not for yours. So\r\nbear it.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A. NEWTON. (Prof. of Zoology at Cambridge.) Down,\r\nFebruary 9 [1870].\r\n\r\nDear Newton,\r\n\r\nI suppose it would be universally held extremely wrong for a defendant\r\nto write to a Judge to express his satisfaction at a judgment in his\r\nfavour; and yet I am going thus to act. I have just read what you\r\nhave said in the 'Record' ('Zoological Record.' The volume for 1868,\r\npublished December 1869.) about my pigeon chapters, and it has gratified\r\nme beyond measure. I have sometimes felt a little disappointed that the\r\nlabour of so many years seemed to be almost thrown away, for you are the\r\nfirst man capable of forming a judgment (excepting partly Quatrefages),\r\nwho seems to have thought anything of this part of my work. The amount\r\nof labour, correspondence, and care, which the subject cost me, is more\r\nthan you could well suppose. I thought the article in the \"Athenaeum\"\r\nwas very unjust; but now I feel amply repaid, and I cordially thank you\r\nfor your sympathy and too warm praise. What labour you have bestowed on\r\nyour part of the 'Record'! I ought to be ashamed to speak of my amount\r\nof work. I thoroughly enjoyed the Sunday, which you and the others spent\r\nhere, and\r\n\r\nI remain, dear Newton, yours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, February 27 [1868].\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nYou cannot well imagine how much I have been pleased by what you say\r\nabout 'Pangenesis.' None of my friends will speak out... Hooker, as far\r\nas I understand him, which I hardly do at present, seems to think that\r\nthe hypothesis is little more than saying that organisms have such\r\nand such potentialities. What you say exactly and fully expresses my\r\nfeeling, viz. that it is a relief to have some feasible explanation\r\nof the various facts, which can be given up as soon as any better\r\nhypothesis is found. It has certainly been an immense relief to my mind;\r\nfor I have been stumbling over the subject for years, dimly seeing that\r\nsome relation existed between the various classes of facts. I now hear\r\nfrom H. Spencer that his views quoted in my foot-note refer to something\r\nquite distinct, as you seem to have perceived.\r\n\r\nI shall be very glad to hear at some future day your criticisms on\r\nthe \"causes of variability.\" Indeed I feel sure that I am right about\r\nsterility and natural selection... I do not quite understand your case,\r\nand we think that a word or two is misplaced. I wish sometime you would\r\nconsider the case under the following point of view:--If sterility is\r\ncaused or accumulated through natural selection, than as every degree\r\nexists up to absolute barrenness, natural selection must have the power\r\nof increasing it. Now take two species, A and B, and assume that they\r\nare (by any means) half-sterile, i.e. produce half the full number of\r\noffspring. Now try and make (by natural selection) A and B absolutely\r\nsterile when crossed, and you will find how difficult it is. I grant\r\nindeed, it is certain, that the degree of sterility of the individuals A\r\nand B will vary, but any such extra-sterile individuals of, we will\r\nsay A, if they should hereafter breed with other individuals of A, will\r\nbequeath no advantage to their progeny, by which these families will\r\ntend to increase in number over other families of A, which are not more\r\nsterile when crossed with B. But I do not know that I have made this any\r\nclearer than in the chapter in my book. It is a most difficult bit of\r\nreasoning, which I have gone over and over again on paper with diagrams.\r\n\r\n... Hearty thanks for your letter. You have indeed pleased me, for I had\r\ngiven up the great god Pan as a stillborn deity. I wish you could be\r\ninduced to make it clear with your admirable powers of elucidation in\r\none of the scientific journals...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, February 28 [1868].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have been deeply interested by your letter, and we had a good laugh\r\nover Huxley's remark, which was so deuced clever that you could not\r\nrecollect it. I cannot quite follow your train of thought, for in the\r\nlast page you admit all that I wish, having apparently denied all, or\r\nthought all mere words in the previous pages of your note; but it may be\r\nmy muddle. I see clearly that any satisfaction which Pan may give will\r\ndepend on the constitution of each man's mind. If you have arrived\r\nalready at any similar conclusion, the whole will of course appear stale\r\nto you. I heard yesterday from Wallace, who says (excuse horrid vanity),\r\n\"I can hardly tell you how much I admire the chapter on 'Pangenesis.'\r\nIt is a POSITIVE COMFORT to me to have any feasible explanation of a\r\ndifficulty that has always been haunting me, and I shall never be able\r\nto give it up till a better one supplies its place, and that I think\r\nhardly possible, etc.\" Now his foregoing [italicised] words express my\r\nsentiments exactly and fully: though perhaps I feel the relief extra\r\nstrongly from having during many years vainly attempted to form some\r\nhypothesis. When you or Huxley say that a single cell of a plant, or the\r\nstump of an amputated limb, have the \"potentiality\" of reproducing\r\nthe whole--or \"diffuse an influence,\" these words give me no positive\r\nidea;--but when it is said that the cells of a plant, or stump, include\r\natoms derived from every other cell of the whole organism and capable of\r\ndevelopment, I gain a distinct idea. But this idea would not be worth\r\na rush, if it applied to one case alone; but it seems to me to apply\r\nto all the forms of reproduction--inheritance--metamorphosis--to the\r\nabnormal transposition of organs--to the direct action of the male\r\nelement on the mother plant, etc. Therefore I fully believe that each\r\ncell does ACTUALLY throw off an atom or gemmule of its contents;--but\r\nwhether or not, this hypothesis serves as a useful connecting link for\r\nvarious grand classes of physiological facts, which at present stand\r\nabsolutely isolated.\r\n\r\nI have touched on the doubtful point (alluded to by Huxley) how far\r\natoms derived from the same cell may become developed into different\r\nstructure accordingly as they are differently nourished; I advanced as\r\nillustrations galls and polypoid excrescences...\r\n\r\nIt is a real pleasure to me to write to you on this subject, and I\r\nshould be delighted if we can understand each other; but you must not\r\nlet your good nature lead you on. Remember, we always fight tooth and\r\nnail. We go to London on Tuesday, first for a week to Queen Anne Street,\r\nand afterwards to Miss Wedgwood's, in Regent's Park, and stay the whole\r\nmonth, which, as my gardener truly says, is a \"terrible thing\" for my\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W. OGLE. (Dr. William Ogle, now the Superintendent of\r\nStatistics to the Registrar-General.) Down, March 6 [1868].\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you most sincerely for your letter, which is very interesting\r\nto me. I wish I had known of these views of Hippocrates before I had\r\npublished, for they seem almost identical with mine--merely a change\r\nof terms--and an application of them to classes of facts necessarily\r\nunknown to the old philosopher. The whole case is a good illustration of\r\nhow rarely anything is new.\r\n\r\nHippocrates has taken the wind out of my sails, but I care very little\r\nabout being forestalled. I advance the views merely as a provisional\r\nhypothesis, but with the secret expectation that sooner or later some\r\nsuch view will have to be admitted.\r\n\r\n... I do not expect the reviewers will be so learned as you: otherwise,\r\nno doubt, I shall be accused of wilfully stealing Pangenesis from\r\nHippocrates,--for this is the spirit some reviewers delight to show.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO VICTOR CARUS. Down, March 21 [1868].\r\n\r\n... I am very much obliged to you for sending me so frankly your opinion\r\non Pangenesis, and I am sorry it is unfavourable, but I cannot quite\r\nunderstand your remark on pangenesis, selection, and the struggle\r\nfor life not being more methodical. I am not at all surprised at your\r\nunfavourable verdict; I know many, probably most, will come to the same\r\nconclusion. One English Review says it is much too complicated... Some\r\nof my friends are enthusiastic on the hypothesis... Sir C. Lyell says\r\nto every one, \"you may not believe in 'Pangenesis,' but if you once\r\nunderstand it, you will never get it out of your mind.\" And with this\r\ncriticism I am perfectly content. All cases of inheritance and reversion\r\nand development now appear to me under a new light...\r\n\r\n[An extract from a letter to Fritz Muller, though of later date (June),\r\nmay be given here:--\r\n\r\n\"Your letter of April 22 has much interested me. I am delighted that you\r\napprove of my book, for I value your opinion more than that of almost\r\nany one. I have yet hopes that you will think well of Pangenesis. I feel\r\nsure that our minds are somewhat alike, and I find it a great relief\r\nto have some definite, though hypothetical view, when I reflect on the\r\nwonderful transformations of animals,--the re-growth of parts,--and\r\nespecially the direct action of pollen on the mother-form, etc. It often\r\nappears to me almost certain that the characters of the parents are\r\n\"photographed\" on the child, only by means of material atoms derived\r\nfrom each cell in both parents, and developed in the child.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, May 8 [1868].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI have been a most ungrateful and ungracious man not to have written to\r\nyou an immense time ago to thank you heartily for the \"Nation\", and for\r\nall your most kind aid in regard to the American edition [of 'Animals\r\nand Plants']. But I have been of late overwhelmed with letters, which\r\nI was forced to answer, and so put off writing to you. This morning\r\nI received the American edition (which looks capital), with your nice\r\npreface, for which hearty thanks. I hope to heaven that the book will\r\nsucceed well enough to prevent you repenting of your aid. This arrival\r\nhas put the finishing stroke to my conscience, which will endure its\r\nwrongs no longer.\r\n\r\n... Your article in the \"Nation\" [March 19] seems to me very good, and\r\nyou give an excellent idea of Pangenesis--an infant cherished by few as\r\nyet, except his tender parent, but which will live a long life. There\r\nis parental presumption for you! You give a good slap at my concluding\r\nmetaphor (A short abstract of the precipice metaphor is given in\r\nVolume I. Dr. Gray's criticism on this point is as follows: \"But in Mr.\r\nDarwin's parallel, to meet the case of nature according to his own view\r\nof it, not only the fragments of rock (answering to variation) should\r\nfall, but the edifice (answering to natural selection) should rise,\r\nirrespective of will or choice!\" But my father's parallel demands that\r\nnatural selection shall be the architect, not the edifice--the question\r\nof design only comes in with regard to the form of the building\r\nmaterials.): undoubtedly I ought to have brought in and contrasted\r\nnatural and artificial selection; but it seems so obvious to me that\r\nnatural selection depended on contingencies even more complex than those\r\nwhich must have determined the shape of each fragment at the base of my\r\nprecipice. What I wanted to show was that in reference to pre-ordainment\r\nwhatever holds good in the formation of a pouter pigeon holds good in\r\nthe formation of a natural species of pigeon. I cannot see that this\r\nis false. If the right variations occurred, and no others, natural\r\nselection would be superfluous. A reviewer in an Edinburgh paper, who\r\ntreats me with profound contempt, says on this subject that Professor\r\nAsa Gray could with the greatest ease smash me into little pieces. (The\r\n\"Daily Review\", April 27, 1868. My father has given rather a highly\r\ncoloured version of the reviewer's remarks: \"We doubt not that Professor\r\nAsa Gray... could show that natural selection... is simply an instrument\r\nin the hands of an omnipotent and omniscient creator.\" The reviewer goes\r\non to say that the passage in question is a \"very melancholy one,\" and\r\nthat the theory is the \"apotheosis of materialism.\")\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Gray, Your ungrateful but sincere friend, CHARLES\r\nDARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO G. BENTHAM. Down, June 23, 1868.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Bentham,\r\n\r\nAs your address (Presidential Address to the Linnean Society.) is\r\nsomewhat of the nature of a verdict from a judge, I do not know whether\r\nit is proper for me to do so, but I must and will thank you for the\r\npleasure which you have given me. I am delighted at what you say about\r\nmy book. I got so tired of it, that for months together I thought\r\nmyself a perfect fool for having given up so much time in collecting\r\nand observing little facts, but now I do not care if a score of common\r\ncritics speak as contemptuously of the book as did the \"Athenaeum\".\r\nI feel justified in this, for I have so complete a reliance on your\r\njudgment that I feel certain that I should have bowed to your judgment\r\nhad it been as unfavourable as it is the contrary. What you say about\r\nPangenesis quite satisfies me, and is as much perhaps as any one is\r\njustified in saying. I have read your whole Address with the greatest\r\ninterest. It must have cost you a vast amount of trouble. With cordial\r\nthanks, pray believe me,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I fear that it is not likely that you have a superfluous copy\r\nof your Address; if you have, I should much like to send one to Fritz\r\nMuller in the interior of Brazil. By the way let me add that I discussed\r\nbud-variation chiefly from a belief which is common to several persons,\r\nthat all variability is related to sexual generation; I wished to show\r\nclearly that this was an error.\r\n\r\n[The above series of letters may serve to show to some extent the\r\nreception which the new book received. Before passing on (in the next\r\nchapter) to the 'Descent of Man,' I give a letter referring to the\r\ntranslation of Fritz Muller's book, 'Fur Darwin,' it was originally\r\npublished in 1864, but the English translation, by Mr. Dallas, which\r\nbore the title suggested by Sir C. Lyell, of 'Facts and Arguments for\r\nDarwin,' did not appear until 1869:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO F. MULLER. Down, March 16 [1868].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour brother, as you will have heard from him, felt so convinced that\r\nyou would not object to a translation of 'Fur Darwin' (In a letter to\r\nFritz Muller, my father wrote:--\"I am vexed to see that on the title my\r\nname is more conspicuous than yours, which I especially objected to, and\r\nI cautioned the printers after seeing one proof.\"), that I have ventured\r\nto arrange for a translation. Engelmann has very liberally offered me\r\ncliches of the woodcuts for 22 thalers; Mr. Murray has agreed to bring\r\nout a translation (and he is our best publisher) on commission, for he\r\nwould not undertake the work on his own risk; and I have agreed with Mr.\r\nW.S. Dallas (who has translated Von Siebold on Parthenogenesis, and many\r\nGerman works, and who writes very good English) to translate the book.\r\nHe thinks (and he is a good judge) that it is important to have some\r\nfew corrections or additions, in order to account for a translation\r\nappearing so lately [i.e. at such a long interval of time] after the\r\noriginal; so that I hope you will be able to send some...\r\n\r\n\r\n[Two letters may be placed here as bearing on the spread of Evolutionary\r\nideas in France and Germany:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A. GAUDRY. Down, January 21 [1868].\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you for your interesting essay on the influence of the\r\nGeological features of the country on the mind and habits of the Ancient\r\nAthenians (This appears to refer to M. Gaudry's paper translated in the\r\n'Geol. Mag.,' 1868, page 372.), and for your very obliging letter. I am\r\ndelighted to hear that you intend to consider the relations of fossil\r\nanimals in connection with their genealogy; it will afford you a\r\nfine field for the exercise of your extensive knowledge and powers of\r\nreasoning. Your belief will I suppose, at present, lower you in the\r\nestimation of your countrymen; but judging from the rapid spread in all\r\nparts of Europe, excepting France, of the belief in the common descent\r\nof allied species, I must think that this belief will before long\r\nbecome universal. How strange it is that the country which gave birth to\r\nBuffon, the elder Geoffroy, and especially to Lamarck, should now cling\r\nso pertinaciously to the belief that species are immutable creations.\r\n\r\nMy work on Variation, etc., under domestication, will appear in a French\r\ntranslation in a few months' time, and I will do myself the pleasure\r\nand honour of directing the publisher to send a copy to you to the same\r\naddress as this letter.\r\n\r\nWith sincere respect, I remain, dear sir, Yours very faithfully, CHARLES\r\nDARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The next letter is of especial interest, as showing how high a value my\r\nfather placed on the support of the younger German naturalists:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W. PREYER. (Now Professor of Physiology at Jena.)\r\nMarch 31, 1868.\r\n\r\n... I am delighted to hear that you uphold the doctrine of the\r\nModification of Species, and defend my views. The support which I\r\nreceive from Germany is my chief ground for hoping that our views\r\nwill ultimately prevail. To the present day I am continually abused\r\nor treated with contempt by writers of my own country; but the younger\r\nnaturalists are almost all on my side, and sooner or later the public\r\nmust follow those who make the subject their special study. The abuse\r\nand contempt of ignorant writers hurts me very little...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.VI. -- WORK ON 'MAN.'\r\n\r\n1864-1870.\r\n\r\n[In the autobiographical chapter in Volume I., my father gives the\r\ncircumstances which led to his writing the 'Descent of Man.' He states\r\nthat his collection of facts, begun in 1837 or 1838, was continued for\r\nmany years without any definite idea of publishing on the subject. The\r\nfollowing letter to Mr. Wallace shows that in the period of ill-health\r\nand depression about 1864 he despaired of ever being able to do so:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, [May?] 28 [1864].\r\n\r\nDear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI am so much better that I have just finished a paper for Linnean\r\nSociety (On the three forms, etc., of Lythrum.); but I am not yet at\r\nall strong, I felt much disinclination to write, and therefore you must\r\nforgive me for not having sooner thanked you for your paper on 'Man'\r\n('Anthropological Review,' March 1864.), received on the 11th. But first\r\nlet me say that I have hardly ever in my life been more struck by any\r\npaper than that on 'Variation,' etc. etc., in the \"Reader\". ('\"Reader\",\r\nApril 16, 1864. \"On the Phenomena of Variation,\" etc. Abstract of a\r\npaper read before the Linnean Society, March 17, 1864.) I feel sure\r\nthat such papers will do more for the spreading of our views on the\r\nmodification of species than any separate Treatises on the simple\r\nsubject itself. It is really admirable; but you ought not in the Man\r\npaper to speak of the theory as mine; it is just as much yours as mine.\r\nOne correspondent has already noticed to me your \"high-minded\" conduct\r\non this head. But now for your Man paper, about which I should like to\r\nwrite more than I can. The great leading idea is quite new to me, viz.\r\nthat during late ages, the mind will have been modified more than the\r\nbody; yet I had got as far as to see with you that the struggle between\r\nthe races of man depended entirely on intellectual and MORAL qualities.\r\nThe latter part of the paper I can designate only as grand and most\r\neloquently done. I have shown your paper to two or three persons who\r\nhave been here, and they have been equally struck with it. I am not\r\nsure that I go with you on all minor points: when reading Sir G. Grey's\r\naccount of the constant battles of Australian savages, I remember\r\nthinking that natural selection would come in, and likewise with the\r\nEsquimaux, with whom the art of fishing and managing canoes is said to\r\nbe hereditary. I rather differ on the rank, under a classificatory point\r\nof view, which you assign to man; I do not think any character simply in\r\nexcess ought ever to be used for the higher divisions. Ants would not be\r\nseparated from other hymenopterous insects, however high the instinct of\r\nthe one, and however low the instincts of the other. With respect to the\r\ndifferences of race, a conjecture has occurred to me that much may\r\nbe due to the correlation of complexion (and consequently hair) with\r\nconstitution. Assume that a dusky individual best escaped miasma, and\r\nyou will readily see what I mean. I persuaded the Director-General of\r\nthe Medical Department of the Army to send printed forms to the surgeons\r\nof all regiments in tropical countries to ascertain this point, but I\r\ndare say I shall never get any returns. Secondly, I suspect that a sort\r\nof sexual selection has been the most powerful means of changing\r\nthe races of man. I can show that the different races have a widely\r\ndifferent standard of beauty. Among savages the most powerful men will\r\nhave the pick of the women, and they will generally leave the most\r\ndescendants. I have collected a few notes on man, but I do not suppose\r\nthat I shall ever use them. Do you intend to follow out your views, and\r\nif so, would you like at some future time to have my few references and\r\nnotes? I am sure I hardly know whether they are of any value, and they\r\nare at present in a state of chaos.\r\n\r\nThere is much more that I should like to write, but I have not strength.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, dear Wallace, yours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Our aristocracy is handsomer (more hideous according to a Chinese\r\nor Negro) than the middle classes, from (having the) pick of the women;\r\nbut oh, what a scheme is primogeniture for destroying natural selection!\r\nI fear my letter will be barely intelligible to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In February 1867, when the manuscript of 'Animals and Plants' had been\r\nsent to Messrs. Clowes to be printed, and before the proofs began to\r\ncome in, he had an interval of spare time, and began a \"chapter on Man,\"\r\nbut he soon found it growing under his hands, and determined to publish\r\nit separately as a \"very small volume.\"\r\n\r\nThe work was interrupted by the necessity of correcting the proofs of\r\n'Animals and Plants,' and by some botanical work, but was resumed in the\r\nfollowing year, 1868, the moment he could give himself up to it.\r\n\r\nHe recognized with regret the gradual change in his mind that rendered\r\ncontinuous work more and more necessary to him as he grew older. This is\r\nexpressed in a letter to Sir J.D. Hooker, June 17, 1868, which repeats\r\nto some extent what is expressed in the Autobiography:--\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you were at the 'Messiah,' it is the one thing that I should\r\nlike to hear again, but I dare say I should find my soul too dried up to\r\nappreciate it as in old days; and then I should feel very flat, for it\r\nis a horrid bore to feel as I constantly do, that I am a withered leaf\r\nfor every subject except Science. It sometimes makes me hate Science,\r\nthough God knows I ought to be thankful for such a perennial interest,\r\nwhich makes me forget for some hours every day my accursed stomach.\"\r\n\r\nThe work on Man was interrupted by illness in the early summer of 1868,\r\nand he left home on July 16th for Freshwater, in the Isle of Wight,\r\nwhere he remained with his family until August 21st. Here he made\r\nthe acquaintance of Mrs. Cameron. She received the whole family with\r\nopen-hearted kindness and hospitality, and my father always retained a\r\nwarm feeling of friendship for her. She made an excellent photograph of\r\nhim, which was published with the inscription written by him: \"I like\r\nthis photograph very much better than any other which has been taken of\r\nme.\" Further interruption occurred in the autumn so that continuous work\r\non the 'Descent of Man' did not begin until 1869. The following letters\r\ngive some idea of the earlier work in 1867:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, February 22, [1867?].\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI am hard at work on sexual selection, and am driven half mad by the\r\nnumber of collateral points which require investigation, such as the\r\nrelative number of the two sexes, and especially on polygamy. Can you\r\naid me with respect to birds which have strongly marked secondary sexual\r\ncharacters, such as birds of paradise, humming-birds, the Rupicola, or\r\nany other such cases? Many gallinaceous birds certainly are polygamous.\r\nI suppose that birds may be known not to be polygamous if they are seen\r\nduring the whole breeding season to associate in pairs, or if the male\r\nincubates or aids in feeding the young. Will you have the kindness to\r\nturn this in your mind? But it is a shame to trouble you now that, as I\r\nam HEARTILY glad to hear, you are at work on your Malayan travels. I am\r\nfearfully puzzled how far to extend your protective views with respect\r\nto the females in various classes. The more I work the more important\r\nsexual selection apparently comes out.\r\n\r\nCan butterflies be polygamous! i.e. will one male impregnate more than\r\none female? Forgive me troubling you, and I dare say I shall have to ask\r\nforgiveness again...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, February 23 [1867].\r\n\r\nDear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI much regretted that I was unable to call on you, but after Monday I\r\nwas unable even to leave the house. On Monday evening I called on Bates,\r\nand put a difficulty before him, which he could not answer, and, as on\r\nsome former similar occasion, his first suggestion was, \"You had better\r\nask Wallace.\" My difficulty is, why are caterpillars sometimes so\r\nbeautifully and artistically coloured? Seeing that many are coloured to\r\nescape danger, I can hardly attribute their bright colour in other cases\r\nto mere physical conditions. Bates says the most gaudy caterpillar he\r\never saw in Amazonia (of a sphinx) was conspicuous at the distance of\r\nyards, from its black and red colours, whilst feeding on large green\r\nleaves. If any one objected to male butterflies having been made\r\nbeautiful by sexual selection, and asked why should they not have been\r\nmade beautiful as well as their caterpillars, what would you answer?\r\nI could not answer, but should maintain my ground. Will you think over\r\nthis, and some time, either by letter or when we meet, tell me what you\r\nthink? Also I want to know whether your FEMALE mimetic butterfly is more\r\nbeautiful and brighter than the male. When next in London I must get you\r\nto show me your kingfishers. My health is a dreadful evil; I failed in\r\nhalf my engagements during this last visit to London.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, February 26 [1867].\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nBates was quite right; you are the man to apply to in a difficulty. I\r\nnever heard anything more ingenious than your suggestion (The\r\nsuggestion that conspicuous caterpillars or perfect insects (e.g. white\r\nbutterflies), which are distasteful to birds, are protected by being\r\neasily recognised and avoided. See Mr. Wallace's 'Natural Selection,'\r\n2nd edition, page 117.), and I hope you may be able to prove it true.\r\nThat is a splendid fact about the white moths; it warms one's very\r\nblood to see a theory thus almost proved to be true. (Mr. Jenner Weir's\r\nobservations published in the Transactions of the Entomolog. Soc. (1869\r\nand 1870) give strong support to the theory in question.) With respect\r\nto the beauty of male butterflies, I must as yet think it is due to\r\nsexual selection. There is some evidence that dragon-flies are attracted\r\nby bright colours; but what leads me to the above belief is, so many\r\nmale Orthoptera and Cicadas having musical instruments. This being the\r\ncase, the analogy of birds makes me believe in sexual selection with\r\nrespect to colour in insects. I wish I had strength and time to make\r\nsome of the experiments suggested by you, but I thought butterflies\r\nwould not pair in confinement. I am sure I have heard of some such\r\ndifficulty. Many years ago I had a dragon-fly painted with gorgeous\r\ncolours, but I never had an opportunity of fairly trying it.\r\n\r\nThe reason of my being so much interested just at present about sexual\r\nselection is, that I have almost resolved to publish a little essay on\r\nthe origin of Mankind, and I still strongly think (though I failed\r\nto convince you, and this, to me, is the heaviest blow possible) that\r\nsexual selection has been the main agent in forming the races of man.\r\n\r\nBy the way, there is another subject which I shall introduce in my\r\nessay, namely, expression of countenance. Now, do you happen to know\r\nby any odd chance a very good-natured and acute observer in the Malay\r\nArchipelago, who you think would make a few easy observations for me on\r\nthe expression of the Malays when excited by various emotions? For in\r\nthis case I would send to such person a list of queries. I thank you for\r\nyour most interesting letter, and remain,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, March [1867].\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI thank you much for your two notes. The case of Julia Pastrana (A\r\nbearded woman having an irregular double set of teeth. 'Animals and\r\nPlants,' volume ii. page 328.) is a splendid addition to my other cases\r\nof correlated teeth and hair, and I will add it in correcting the press\r\nof my present volume. Pray let me hear in the course of the summer if\r\nyou get any evidence about the gaudy caterpillars. I should much like\r\nto give (or quote if published) this idea of yours, if in any way\r\nsupported, as suggested by you. It will, however, be a long time hence,\r\nfor I can see that sexual selection is growing into quite a large\r\nsubject, which I shall introduce into my essay on Man, supposing that\r\nI ever publish it. I had intended giving a chapter on man, inasmuch as\r\nmany call him (not QUITE truly) an eminently domesticated animal, but\r\nI found the subject too large for a chapter. Nor shall I be capable of\r\ntreating the subject well, and my sole reason for taking it up is, that\r\nI am pretty well convinced that sexual selection has played an important\r\npart in the formation of races, and sexual selection has always been a\r\nsubject which has interested me much. I have been very glad to see your\r\nimpression from memory on the expression of Malays. I fully agree with\r\nyou that the subject is in no way an important one; it is simply a\r\n\"hobby-horse\" with me, about twenty-seven years old; and AFTER thinking\r\nthat I would write an essay on man, it flashed on me that I could work\r\nin some \"supplemental remarks on expression.\" After the horrid,\r\ntedious, dull work of my present huge, and I fear unreadable, book ['The\r\nVariation of Animals and Plants'], I thought I would amuse myself with\r\nmy hobby-horse. The subject is, I think, more curious and more amenable\r\nto scientific treatment than you seem willing to allow. I want, anyhow,\r\nto upset Sir C. Bell's view, given in his most interesting work, 'The\r\nAnatomy of Expression,' that certain muscles have been given to man\r\nsolely that he may reveal to other men his feelings. I want to try\r\nand show how expressions have arisen. That is a good suggestion about\r\nnewspapers, but my experience tells me that private applications are\r\ngenerally most fruitful. I will, however, see if I can get the queries\r\ninserted in some Indian paper. I do not know the names or addresses of\r\nany other papers.\r\n\r\n... My two female amanuenses are busy with friends, and I fear this\r\nscrawl will give you much trouble to read. With many thanks,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter may be worth giving, as an example of his sources\r\nof information, and as showing what were the thoughts at this time\r\noccupying him:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO F. MULLER. Down, February 22 [1867].\r\n\r\n... Many thanks for all the curious facts about the unequal number of the\r\nsexes in Crustacea, but the more I investigate this subject the deeper\r\nI sink in doubt and difficulty. Thanks also for the confirmation of\r\nthe rivalry of Cicadae. I have often reflected with surprise on the\r\ndiversity of the means for producing music with insects, and still more\r\nwith birds. We thus get a high idea of the importance of song in the\r\nanimal kingdom. Please to tell me where I can find any account of the\r\nauditory organs in the Orthoptera. Your facts are quite new to me.\r\nScudder has described an insect in the Devonian strata, furnished with\r\na stridulating apparatus. I believe he is to be trusted, and, if so, the\r\napparatus is of astonishing antiquity. After reading Landois's paper I\r\nhave been working at the stridulating organ in the Lamellicorn beetles,\r\nin expectation of finding it sexual; but I have only found it as yet in\r\ntwo cases, and in these it was equally developed in both sexes. I wish\r\nyou would look at any of your common lamellicorns, and take hold of\r\nboth males and females, and observe whether they make the squeaking or\r\ngrating noise equally. If they do not, you could, perhaps, send me a\r\nmale and female in a light little box. How curious it is that there\r\nshould be a special organ for an object apparently so unimportant as\r\nsqueaking. Here is another point; have you any toucans? if so, ask any\r\ntrustworthy hunter whether the beaks of the males, or of both sexes, are\r\nmore brightly coloured during the breeding season than at other times\r\nof the year... Heaven knows whether I shall ever live to make use of\r\nhalf the valuable facts which you have communicated to me! Your paper\r\non Balanus armatus, translated by Mr. Dallas, has just appeared in our\r\n'Annals and Magazine of Natural History,' and I have read it with the\r\ngreatest interest. I never thought that I should live to hear of a\r\nhybrid Balanus! I am very glad that you have seen the cement tubes; they\r\nappear to me extremely curious, and, as far as I know, you are the first\r\nman who has verified my observations on this point.\r\n\r\nWith most cordial thanks for all your kindness, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A. DE CANDOLLE. Down, July 6, 1868.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI return you my SINCERE thanks for your long letter, which I consider a\r\ngreat compliment, and which is quite full of most interesting facts and\r\nviews. Your references and remarks will be of great use should a new\r\nedition of my book ('Variation of Animals and Plants.') be demanded, but\r\nthis is hardly probable, for the whole edition was sold within the first\r\nweek, and another large edition immediately reprinted, which I should\r\nthink would supply the demand for ever. You ask me when I shall publish\r\non the 'Variation of Species in a State of Nature.' I have had the MS.\r\nfor another volume almost ready during several years, but I was so much\r\nfatigued by my last book that I determined to amuse myself by publishing\r\na short essay on the 'Descent of Man.' I was partly led to do this by\r\nhaving been taunted that I concealed my views, but chiefly from the\r\ninterest which I had long taken in the subject. Now this essay has\r\nbranched out into some collateral subjects, and I suppose will take me\r\nmore than a year to complete. I shall then begin on 'Species,' but my\r\nhealth makes me a very slow workman. I hope that you will excuse these\r\ndetails, which I have given to show that you will have plenty of time to\r\npublish your views first, which will be a great advantage to me. Of all\r\nthe curious facts which you mention in your letter, I think that of\r\nthe strong inheritance of the scalp-muscles has interested me most. I\r\npresume that you would not object to my giving this very curious case on\r\nyour authority. As I believe all anatomists look at the scalp-muscles\r\nas a remnant of the Panniculus carnosus which is common to all the lower\r\nquadrupeds, I should look at the unusual development and inheritance of\r\nthese muscles as probably a case of reversion. Your observation on\r\nso many remarkable men in noble families having been illegitimate is\r\nextremely curious; and should I ever meet any one capable of writing an\r\nessay on this subject, I will mention your remarks as a good suggestion.\r\nDr. Hooker has several times remarked to me that morals and politics\r\nwould be very interesting if discussed like any branch of natural\r\nhistory, and this is nearly to the same effect with your remarks...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO L. AGASSIZ. Down, August 19, 1868.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you cordially for your very kind letter. I certainly thought\r\nthat you had formed so low an opinion of my scientific work that it\r\nmight have appeared indelicate in me to have asked for information from\r\nyou, but it never occurred to me that my letter would have been shown to\r\nyou. I have never for a moment doubted your kindness and generosity, and\r\nI hope you will not think it presumption in me to say, that when we met,\r\nmany years ago, at the British Association at Southampton, I felt for\r\nyou the warmest admiration.\r\n\r\nYour information on the Amazonian fishes has interested me EXTREMELY,\r\nand tells me exactly what I wanted to know. I was aware, through notes\r\ngiven me by Dr. Gunther, that many fishes differed sexually in colour\r\nand other characters, but I was particularly anxious to learn how far\r\nthis was the case with those fishes in which the male, differently from\r\nwhat occurs with most birds, takes the largest share in the care of\r\nthe ova and young. Your letter has not only interested me much, but\r\nhas greatly gratified me in other respects, and I return you my sincere\r\nthanks for your kindness. Pray believe me, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Sunday, August 23 [1868].\r\n\r\nMy dear old Friend,\r\n\r\nI have received your note. I can hardly say how pleased I have been\r\nat the success of your address (Sir Joseph Hooker was President of the\r\nBritish Association at the Norwich Meeting in 1868.), and of the\r\nwhole meeting. I have seen the \"Times\", \"Telegraph\", \"Spectator\", and\r\n\"Athenaeum\", and have heard of other favourable newspapers, and have\r\nordered a bundle. There is a \"chorus of praise.\" The \"Times\" reported\r\nmiserably, i.e. as far as errata was concerned; but I was very glad\r\nat the leader, for I thought the way you brought in the megalithic\r\nmonuments most happy. (The British Association was desirous of\r\ninteresting the Government in certain modern cromlech builders, the\r\nKhasia race of East Bengal, in order that their megalithic monuments\r\nmight be efficiently described.) I particularly admired Tyndall's little\r\nspeech (Professor Tyndall was President of Section A.)... The \"Spectator\"\r\npitches a little into you about Theology, in accordance with its usual\r\nspirit...\r\n\r\nYour great success has rejoiced my heart. I have just carefully read the\r\nwhole address in the \"Athenaeum\"; and though, as you know, I liked it\r\nvery much when you read it to me, yet, as I was trying all the time to\r\nfind fault, I missed to a certain extent the effect as a whole; and this\r\nnow appears to me most striking and excellent. How you must rejoice at\r\nall your bothering labour and anxiety having had so grand an end. I must\r\nsay a word about myself; never has such a eulogium been passed on me,\r\nand it makes me very proud. I cannot get over my AMAZEMENT at what you\r\nsay about my botanical work. By Jove, as far as my memory goes, you have\r\nstrengthened instead of weakened some of the expressions. What is far\r\nmore important than anything personal, is the conviction which I feel\r\nthat you will have immensely advanced the belief in the evolution of\r\nspecies. This will follow from the publicity of the occasion, your\r\nposition, so responsible, as President, and your own high reputation.\r\nIt will make a great step in public opinion, I feel sure, and I had not\r\nthought of this before. The \"Athenaeum\" takes your snubbing (Sir Joseph\r\nHooker made some reference to the review of 'Animals and Plants' in the\r\n\"Athenaeum\" of February 15, 1868.) with the utmost mildness. I certainly\r\ndo rejoice over the snubbing, and hope [the reviewer] will feel it a\r\nlittle. Whenever you have SPARE time to write again, tell me whether\r\nany astronomers (In discussing the astronomer's objection to Evolution,\r\nnamely that our globe has not existed for a long enough period to give\r\ntime for the assumed transmutation of living beings, Hooker challenged\r\nWhewell's dictum that, astronomy is the queen of sciences--the only\r\nperfect science.) took your remarks in ill part; as they now stand they\r\ndo not seem at all too harsh and presumptuous. Many of your sentences\r\nstrike me as extremely felicitous and eloquent. That of Lyell's\r\n\"under-pinning\" (After a eulogium on Sir Charles Lyell's heroic\r\nrenunciation of his old views in accepting Evolution, Sir J.D. Hooker\r\ncontinued, \"Well may he be proud of a superstructure, raised on the\r\nfoundations of an insecure doctrine, when he finds that he can underpin\r\nit and substitute a new foundation; and after all is finished, survey\r\nhis edifice, not only more secure but more harmonious in its proportion\r\nthan it was before.\"), is capital. Tell me, was Lyell pleased? I am so\r\nglad that you remembered my old dedication. (The 'Naturalist's Voyage'\r\nwas dedicated to Lyell.) Was Wallace pleased?\r\n\r\nHow about photographs? Can you spare time for a line to our dear\r\nMrs. Cameron? She came to see us off, and loaded us with presents of\r\nphotographs, and Erasmus called after her, \"Mrs. Cameron, there are six\r\npeople in this house all in love with you.\" When I paid her, she cried\r\nout, \"Oh what a lot of money!\" and ran to boast to her husband.\r\n\r\nI must not write any more, though I am in tremendous spirits at your\r\nbrilliant success.\r\n\r\nYours ever affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the \"Athenaeum\" of November 29, 1868, appeared an article which was\r\nin fact a reply to Sir Joseph Hooker's remarks at Norwich. He seems to\r\nhave consulted my father as to the wisdom of answering the article. My\r\nfather wrote on September 1:\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion Dr. Joseph Dalton Hooker need take no notice of the\r\nattack in the \"Athenaeum\" in reference to Mr. Charles Darwin. What\r\nan ass the man is to think he cuts one to the quick by giving one's\r\nChristian name in full. How transparently false is the statement that my\r\nsole groundwork is from pigeons, because I state I have worked them\r\nout more fully than other beings! He muddles together two books of\r\nFlourens.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter refers to a paper ('Transactions of the Ottawa\r\nAcademy of Natural Sciences,' 1868, by John D. Caton, late Chief Justice\r\nof Illinois.) by Judge Caton, of which my father often spoke with\r\nadmiration:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO JOHN D. CATON. Down, September 18, 1868.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI beg leave to thank you very sincerely for your kindness in sending me,\r\nthrough Mr. Walsh, your admirable paper on American Deer.\r\n\r\nIt is quite full of most interesting observations, stated with the\r\ngreatest clearness. I have seldom read a paper with more interest, for\r\nit abounds with facts of direct use for my work. Many of them consist\r\nof little points which hardly any one besides yourself has observed, or\r\nperceived the importance of recording. I would instance the age at which\r\nthe horns are developed (a point on which I have lately been in vain\r\nsearching for information), the rudiment of horns in the female elk, and\r\nespecially the different nature of the plants devoured by the deer and\r\nelk, and several other points. With cordial thanks for the pleasure and\r\ninstruction which you have afforded me, and with high respect for your\r\npower of observation, I beg leave to remain, dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours faithfully and obliged, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following extract from a letter (September 24, 1868) to the\r\nMarquis de Saporta, the eminent palaeo-botanist, refers to the growth of\r\nevolutionary views in France (In 1868 he was pleased at being asked to\r\nauthorise a French translation of his 'Naturalist's Voyage.':--\r\n\r\n\"As I have formerly read with great interest many of your papers on\r\nfossil plants, you may believe with what high satisfaction I hear that\r\nyou are a believer in the gradual evolution of species. I had supposed\r\nthat my book on the 'Origin of Species' had made very little impression\r\nin France, and therefore it delights me to hear a different statement\r\nfrom you. All the great authorities of the Institute seem firmly\r\nresolved to believe in the immutability of species, and this has always\r\nastonished me... almost the one exception, as far as I know, is M.\r\nGaudry, and I think he will be soon one of the chief leaders in\r\nZoological Palaeontology in Europe; and now I am delighted to hear that\r\nin the sister department of Botany you take nearly the same view.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO E. HAECKEL. Down, November 19 [1868].\r\n\r\nMy dear Haeckel,\r\n\r\nI must write to you again, for two reasons. Firstly, to thank you for\r\nyour letter about your baby, which has quite charmed both me and\r\nmy wife; I heartily congratulate you on its birth. I remember being\r\nsurprised in my own case how soon the paternal instincts became\r\ndeveloped, and in you they seem to be unusually strong,... I hope the\r\nlarge blue eyes and the principles of inheritance will make your child\r\nas good a naturalist as you are; but, judging from my own experience,\r\nyou will be astonished to find how the whole mental disposition of your\r\nchildren changes with advancing years. A young child, and the same when\r\nnearly grown, sometimes differ almost as much as do a caterpillar and\r\nbutterfly.\r\n\r\nThe second point is to congratulate you on the projected translation of\r\nyour great work ('Generelle Morphologie,' 1866. No English translation\r\nof this book has appeared.), about which I heard from Huxley last\r\nSunday. I am heartily glad of it, but how it has been brought about,\r\nI know not, for a friend who supported the supposed translation at\r\nNorwich, told me he thought there would be no chance of it. Huxley tells\r\nme that you consent to omit and shorten some parts, and I am confident\r\nthat this is very wise. As I know your object is to instruct the public,\r\nyou will assuredly thus get many more readers in England. Indeed, I\r\nbelieve that almost every book would be improved by condensation. I\r\nhave been reading a good deal of your last book ('Die Naturliche\r\nSchopfungs-Geschichte,' 1868. It was translated and published in\r\n1876, under the title, 'The History of Creation.'), and the style is\r\nbeautifully clear and easy to me; but why it should differ so much in\r\nthis respect from your great work I cannot imagine. I have not yet read\r\nthe first part, but began with the chapter on Lyell and myself, which\r\nyou will easily believe pleased me VERY MUCH. I think Lyell, who\r\nwas apparently much pleased by your sending him a copy, is also much\r\ngratified by this chapter. (See Lyell's interesting letter to Haeckel.\r\n'Life of Sir C. Lyell,' ii. page 435.) Your chapters on the affinities\r\nand genealogy of the animal kingdom strike me as admirable and full of\r\noriginal thought. Your boldness, however, sometimes makes me tremble,\r\nbut as Huxley remarked, some one must be bold enough to make a\r\nbeginning in drawing up tables of descent. Although you fully admit\r\nthe imperfection of the geological record, yet Huxley agreed with me in\r\nthinking that you are sometimes rather rash in venturing to say at what\r\nperiods the several groups first appeared. I have this advantage over\r\nyou, that I remember how wonderfully different any statement on this\r\nsubject made 20 years ago, would have been to what would now be\r\nthe case, and I expect the next 20 years will make quite as great a\r\ndifference. Reflect on the monocotyledonous plant just discovered in the\r\nPRIMORDIAL formation in Sweden.\r\n\r\nI repeat how glad I am at the prospect of the translation, for I fully\r\nbelieve that this work and all your works will have a great influence in\r\nthe advancement of Science.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Haeckel, your sincere friend, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[It was in November of this year that he sat for the bust by Mr.\r\nWoolner: he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"I should have written long ago, but I have been pestered with stupid\r\nletters, and am undergoing the purgatory of sitting for hours to\r\nWoolner, who, however, is wonderfully pleasant, and lightens as much as\r\nman can, the penance; as far as I can judge, it will make a fine bust.\"\r\n\r\nIf I may criticise the work of so eminent a sculptor as Mr. Woolner,\r\nI should say that the point in which the bust fails somewhat as a\r\nportrait, is that it has a certain air, almost of pomposity, which seems\r\nto me foreign to my father's expression.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1869.\r\n\r\n[At the beginning of the year he was at work in preparing the fifth\r\nedition of the 'Origin.' This work was begun on the day after Christmas,\r\n1868, and was continued for \"forty-six days,\" as he notes in his diary,\r\ni.e. until February 10th, 1869. He then, February 11th, returned to\r\nSexual Selection, and continued at this subject (excepting for ten days\r\ngiven up to Orchids, and a week in London), until June 10th, when he\r\nwent with his family to North Wales, where he remained about seven\r\nweeks, returning to Down on July 31st.\r\n\r\nCaerdeon, the house where he stayed, is built on the north shore of the\r\nbeautiful Barmouth estuary, and is pleasantly placed, in being close\r\nto wild hill country behind, as well as to the picturesque wooded\r\n\"hummocks,\" between the steeper hills and the river. My father was ill\r\nand somewhat depressed throughout this visit, and I think felt saddened\r\nat being imprisoned by his want of strength, and unable even to reach\r\nthe hills over which he had once wandered for days together.\r\n\r\nHe wrote from Caerdeon to Sir J.D. Hooker (June 22nd):--\r\n\r\n\"We have been here for ten days, how I wish it was possible for you to\r\npay us a visit here; we have a beautiful house with a terraced garden,\r\nand a really magnificent view of Cader, right opposite. Old Cader is a\r\ngrand fellow, and shows himself off superbly with every changing light.\r\nWe remain here till the end of July, when the H. Wedgwoods have the\r\nhouse. I have been as yet in a very poor way; it seems as soon as the\r\nstimulus of mental work stops, my whole strength gives way. As yet\r\nI have hardly crawled half a mile from the house, and then have been\r\nfearfully fatigued. It is enough to make one wish oneself quiet in a\r\ncomfortable tomb.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the fifth edition of the 'Origin,' he wrote to Mr.\r\nWallace (January 22, 1869):--\r\n\r\n\"I have been interrupted in my regular work in preparing a new edition\r\nof the 'Origin,' which has cost me much labour, and which I hope I have\r\nconsiderably improved in two or three important points. I always thought\r\nindividual differences more important than single variations, but now I\r\nhave come to the conclusion that they are of paramount importance, and\r\nin this I believe I agree with you. Fleeming Jenkin's arguments have\r\nconvinced me.\"\r\n\r\nThis somewhat obscure sentence was explained, February 2, in another\r\nletter to Mr. Wallace:--\r\n\r\n\"I must have expressed myself atrociously; I meant to say exactly the\r\nreverse of what you have understood. F. Jenkin argued in the 'North\r\nBritish Review' against single variations ever being perpetuated, and\r\nhas convinced me, though not in quite so broad a manner as here put. I\r\nalways thought individual differences more important; but I was blind\r\nand thought that single variations might be preserved much oftener than\r\nI now see is possible or probable. I mentioned this in my former note\r\nmerely because I believed that you had come to a similar conclusion, and\r\nI like much to be in accord with you. I believe I was mainly deceived\r\nby single variations offering such simple illustrations, as when man\r\nselects.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Fleeming Jenkin's review, on the 'Origin of Species,'\r\nwas published in the 'North British Review' for June 1867. It is not a\r\nlittle remarkable that the criticisms, which my father, as I believe,\r\nfelt to be the most valuable ever made on his views should have come,\r\nnot from a professed naturalist but from a Professor of Engineering.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give in a short compass an account of Fleeming\r\nJenkin's argument. My father's copy of the paper (ripped out of the\r\nvolume as usual, and tied with a bit of string) is annotated in pencil\r\nin many places. I may quote one passage opposite which my father has\r\nwritten \"good sneers\"--but it should be remembered that he used the word\r\n\"sneer\" in rather a special sense, not as necessarily implying a feeling\r\nof bitterness in the critic, but rather in the sense of \"banter.\"\r\nSpeaking of the 'true believer,' Fleeming Jenkin says, page 293:--\r\n\r\n\"He can invent trains of ancestors of whose existence there is no\r\nevidence; he can marshal hosts of equally imaginary foes; he can call\r\nup continents, floods, and peculiar atmospheres; he can dry up oceans,\r\nsplit islands, and parcel out eternity at will; surely with these\r\nadvantages he must be a dull fellow if he cannot scheme some series\r\nof animals and circumstances explaining our assumed difficulty quite\r\nnaturally. Feeling the difficulty of dealing with adversaries who\r\ncommand so huge a domain of fancy, we will abandon these arguments,\r\nand trust to those which at least cannot be assailed by mere efforts of\r\nimagination.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fifth edition of the 'Origin,' my father altered a passage in the\r\nHistorical Sketch (fourth edition page xviii.). He thus practically gave\r\nup the difficult task of understanding whether or no Sir R. Owen claims\r\nto have discovered the principle of Natural Selection. Adding, \"As\r\nfar as the mere enunciation of the principle of Natural Selection is\r\nconcerned, it is quite immaterial whether or not Professor Owen preceded\r\nme, for both of us... were long ago preceded by Dr. Wells and Mr.\r\nMatthew.\"\r\n\r\nA somewhat severe critique on the fifth edition, by Mr. John Robertson,\r\nappeared in the \"Athenaeum\", August 14, 1869. The writer comments with\r\nsome little bitterness on the success of the 'Origin:' \"Attention is not\r\nacceptance. Many editions do not mean real success. The book has sold;\r\nthe guess has been talked over; and the circulation and discussion sum\r\nup the significance of the editions.\" Mr. Robertson makes the true, but\r\nmisleading statement: \"Mr. Darwin prefaces his fifth English edition\r\nwith an Essay, which he calls 'An Historical Sketch,' etc.\" As a matter\r\nof fact the Sketch appeared in the third edition in 1861.\r\n\r\nMr. Robertson goes on to say that the Sketch ought to be called a\r\ncollection of extracts anticipatory or corroborative of the hypothesis\r\nof Natural Selection. \"For no account is given of any hostile opinions.\r\nThe fact is very significant. This historical sketch thus resembles the\r\nhistories of the reign of Louis XVIII., published after the Restoration,\r\nfrom which the Republic and the Empire, Robespierre and Buonaparte were\r\nomitted.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter to Prof. Victor Carus gives an idea of the\r\ncharacter of the new edition of the 'Origin:']\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO VICTOR CARUS. Down, May 4, 1869.\r\n\r\n... I have gone very carefully through the whole, trying to make\r\nsome parts clearer, and adding a few discussions and facts of some\r\nimportance. The new edition is only two pages at the end longer than\r\nthe old; though in one part nine pages in advance, for I have condensed\r\nseveral parts and omitted some passages. The translation I fear will\r\ncause you a great deal of trouble; the alterations took me six weeks,\r\nbesides correcting the press; you ought to make a special agreement with\r\nM. Koch [the publisher]. Many of the corrections are only a few words,\r\nbut they have been made from the evidence on various points appearing to\r\nhave become a little stronger or weaker.\r\n\r\nThus I have been led to place somewhat more value on the definite and\r\ndirect action of external conditions; to think the lapse of time, as\r\nmeasured by years, not quite so great as most geologists have thought;\r\nand to infer that single variations are of even less importance, in\r\ncomparison with individual differences, than I formerly thought. I\r\nmention these points because I have been thus led to alter in many\r\nplaces A FEW WORDS; and unless you go through the whole new edition, one\r\npart will not agree with another, which would be a great blemish...\r\n\r\n[The desire that his views might spread in France was always strong with\r\nmy father, and he was therefore justly annoyed to find that in 1869\r\nthe Editor of the first French edition had brought out a third edition\r\nwithout consulting the author. He was accordingly glad to enter into\r\nan arrangement for a French translation of the fifth edition; this\r\nwas undertaken by M. Reinwald, with whom he continued to have pleasant\r\nrelations as the publisher of many of his books into French.\r\n\r\nHe wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"I must enjoy myself and tell you about Mdlle. C. Royer, who translated\r\nthe 'Origin' into French, and for whose second edition I took infinite\r\ntrouble. She has now just brought out a third edition without informing\r\nme, so that all the corrections, etc., in the fourth and fifth English\r\neditions are lost. Besides her enormously long preface to the first\r\nedition, she has added a second preface abusing me like a pick-pocket\r\nfor Pangenesis, which of course has no relation to the 'Origin.' So\r\nI wrote to Paris; and Reinwald agrees to bring out at once a new\r\ntranslation from the fifth English edition, in competition with her\r\nthird edition... This fact shows that \"evolution of species\" must at last\r\nbe spreading in France.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to the spread of Evolution among the orthodox, the\r\nfollowing letter is of some interest. In March he received, from the\r\nauthor, a copy of a lecture by Rev. T.R.R. Stebbing, given before the\r\nTorquay Natural History Society, February 1, 1869, bearing the title\r\n\"Darwinism.\" My father wrote to Mr. Stebbing:]\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged to you for your kindness in sending me your\r\nspirited and interesting lecture; if a layman had delivered the same\r\naddress, he would have done good service in spreading what, as I\r\nhope and believe, is to a large extent the truth; but a clergyman in\r\ndelivering such an address does, as it appears to me, much more good\r\nby his power to shake ignorant prejudices, and by setting, if I may be\r\npermitted to say so, an admirable example of liberality.\r\n\r\nWith sincere respect, I beg leave to remain, Dear Sir, yours faithfully\r\nand obliged, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The references to the subject of expression in the following letter are\r\nexplained by the fact that my father's original intention was to give\r\nhis essay on this subject as a chapter in the 'Descent of Man,' which\r\nin its turn grew, as we have seen, out of a proposed chapter in 'Animals\r\nand Plants:']\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO F. MULLER. Down, February 22 [1869?].\r\n\r\n... Although you have aided me to so great an extent in many ways, I am\r\ngoing to beg for any information on two other subjects. I am preparing\r\na discussion on \"Sexual Selection,\" and I want much to know how low down\r\nin the animal scale sexual selection of a particular kind extends.\r\nDo you know of any lowly organised animals, in which the sexes are\r\nseparated, and in which the male differs from the female in arms of\r\noffence, like the horns and tusks of male mammals, or in gaudy plumage\r\nand ornaments, as with birds and butterflies? I do not refer to\r\nsecondary sexual characters, by which the male is able to discover\r\nthe female, like the plumed antennae of moths, or by which the male is\r\nenabled to seize the female, like the curious pincers described by you\r\nin some of the lower Crustaceans. But what I want to know is, how low\r\nin the scale sexual differences occur which require some degree of\r\nself-consciousness in the males, as weapons by which they fight for the\r\nfemale, or ornaments which attract the opposite sex. Any differences\r\nbetween males and females which follow different habits of life would\r\nhave to be excluded. I think you will easily see what I wish to learn.\r\nA priori, it would never have been anticipated that insects would have\r\nbeen attracted by the beautiful colouring of the opposite sex, or by\r\nthe sounds emitted by the various musical instruments of the male\r\nOrthoptera. I know no one so likely to answer this question as yourself,\r\nand should be grateful for any information, however small.\r\n\r\nMy second subject refers to expression of countenance, to which I\r\nhave long attended, and on which I feel a keen interest; but to which,\r\nunfortunately, I did not attend when I had the opportunity of observing\r\nvarious races of man. It has occurred to me that you might, without much\r\ntrouble, make a FEW observations for me, in the course of some months,\r\non Negroes, or possibly on native South Americans, though I care most\r\nabout Negroes; accordingly I enclose some questions as a guide, and if\r\nyou could answer me even one or two I should feel truly obliged. I am\r\nthinking of writing a little essay on the Origin of Mankind, as I\r\nhave been taunted with concealing my opinions, and I should do this\r\nimmediately after the completion of my present book. In this case I\r\nshould add a chapter on the cause or meaning of expression...\r\n\r\n\r\n[The remaining letters of this year deal chiefly with the books,\r\nreviews, etc., which interested him.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO H. THIEL. Down, February 25, 1869.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nOn my return home after a short absence, I found your very courteous\r\nnote, and the pamphlet ('Ueber einige Formen der Landwirthschaftlichen\r\nGenossenschaften.' by Dr. H. Thiel, then of the Agricultural Station\r\nat Poppelsdorf.), and I hasten to thank you for both, and for the very\r\nhonourable mention which you make of my name. You will readily believe\r\nhow much interested I am in observing that you apply to moral and social\r\nquestions analogous views to those which I have used in regard to the\r\nmodification of species. It did not occur to me formerly that my\r\nviews could be extended to such widely different, and most important,\r\nsubjects. With much respect, I beg leave to remain, dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours faithfully and obliged, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, March 19 [1869].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nThanks for your 'Address.' (In his 'Anniversary Address' to the\r\nGeological Society, 1869, Mr. Huxley criticised Sir William Thomson's\r\npaper ('Trans. Geol. Soc., Glasgow,' volume iii.) \"On Geological Time.\")\r\nPeople complain of the unequal distribution of wealth, but it is a much\r\ngreater shame and injustice that any one man should have the power to\r\nwrite so many brilliant essays as you have lately done. There is no one\r\nwho writes like you... If I were in your shoes, I should tremble for my\r\nlife. I agree with all you say, except that I must think that you\r\ndraw too great a distinction between the evolutionists and the\r\nuniformitarians.\r\n\r\nI find that the few sentences which I have sent to press in the 'Origin'\r\nabout the age of the world will do fairly well...\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, March 22 [1869].\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI have finished your book ('The Malay Archipelago,' etc., 1869.); it\r\nseems to me excellent, and at the same time most pleasant to read. That\r\nyou ever returned alive is wonderful after all your risks from illness\r\nand sea voyages, especially that most interesting one to Waigiou and\r\nback. Of all the impressions which I have received from your book, the\r\nstrongest is that your perseverance in the cause of science was heroic.\r\nYour descriptions of catching the splendid butterflies have made me\r\nquite envious, and at the same time have made me feel almost young\r\nagain, so vividly have they brought before my mind old days when\r\nI collected, though I never made such captures as yours. Certainly\r\ncollecting is the best sport in the world. I shall be astonished if\r\nyour book has not a great success; and your splendid generalizations on\r\nGeographical Distribution, with which I am familiar from your papers,\r\nwill be new to most of your readers. I think I enjoyed most the Timor\r\ncase, as it is best demonstrated; but perhaps Celebes is really the\r\nmost valuable. I should prefer looking at the whole Asiatic continent\r\nas having formerly been more African in its fauna, than admitting the\r\nformer existence of a continent across the Indian Ocean...\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter refers to Mr. Wallace's article in the April\r\nnumber of the 'Quarterly Review' (My father wrote to Mr. Murray: \"The\r\narticle by Wallace is inimitably good, and it is a great triumph that\r\nsuch an article should appear in the 'Quarterly,' and will make the\r\nBishop of Oxford and --gnash their teeth.\"), 1869, which to a large\r\nextent deals with the tenth edition of Sir Charles Lyell's 'Principles,'\r\npublished in 1867 and 1868. The review contains a striking passage\r\non Sir Charles Lyell's confession of evolutionary faith in the tenth\r\nedition of his 'Principles,' which is worth quoting: \"The history of\r\nscience hardly presents so striking an instance of youthfulness of mind\r\nin advanced life as is shown by this abandonment of opinions so long\r\nheld and so powerfully advocated; and if we bear in mind the extreme\r\ncaution, combined with the ardent love of truth which characterise every\r\nwork which our author has produced, we shall be convinced that so great\r\na change was not decided on without long and anxious deliberation, and\r\nthat the views now adopted must indeed be supported by arguments of\r\noverwhelming force. If for no other reason than that Sir Charles Lyell\r\nin his tenth edition has adopted it, the theory of Mr. Darwin deserves\r\nan attentive and respectful consideration from every earnest seeker\r\nafter truth.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, April 14, 1869.\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI have been wonderfully interested by your article, and I should think\r\nLyell will be much gratified by it. I declare if I had been editor, and\r\nhad the power of directing you, I should have selected for discussion\r\nthe very points which you have chosen. I have often said to younger\r\ngeologists (for I began in the year 1830) that they did not know what a\r\nrevolution Lyell had effected; nevertheless, your extracts from Cuvier\r\nhave quite astonished me. Though not able really to judge, I am inclined\r\nto put more confidence in Croll than you seem to do; but I have been\r\nmuch struck by many of your remarks on degradation. Thomson's views of\r\nthe recent age of the world have been for some time one of my sorest\r\ntroubles, and so I have been glad to read what you say. Your exposition\r\nof Natural Selection seems to me inimitably good; there never lived a\r\nbetter expounder than you. I was also much pleased at your discussing\r\nthe difference between our views and Lamarck's. One sometimes sees the\r\nodious expression, \"Justice to myself compels me to say,\" etc., but\r\nyou are the only man I ever heard of who persistently does himself an\r\ninjustice, and never demands justice. Indeed, you ought in the review to\r\nhave alluded to your paper in the 'Linnean Journal,' and I feel sure all\r\nour friends will agree in this. But you cannot \"Burke\" yourself, however\r\nmuch you may try, as may be seen in half the articles which appear. I\r\nwas asked but the other day by a German professor for your paper,\r\nwhich I sent him. Altogether I look at your article as appearing in the\r\n'Quarterly' as an immense triumph for our cause. I presume that your\r\nremarks on Man are those to which you alluded in your note. If you had\r\nnot told me I should have thought that they had been added by some one\r\nelse. As you expected, I differ grievously from you, and I am very\r\nsorry for it. I can see no necessity for calling in an additional and\r\nproximate cause in regard to man. (Mr. Wallace points out that any\r\none acquainted merely with the \"unaided productions of nature,\" might\r\nreasonably doubt whether a dray-horse, for example, could have been\r\ndeveloped by the power of man directing the \"action of the laws of\r\nvariation, multiplication, and survival, for his own purpose. We know,\r\nhowever, that this has been done, and we must therefore admit the\r\npossibility that in the development of the human race, a higher\r\nintelligence has guided the same laws for nobler ends.\") But the subject\r\nis too long for a letter. I have been particularly glad to read your\r\ndiscussion because I am now writing and thinking much about man.\r\n\r\nI hope that your Malay book sells well; I was extremely pleased with\r\nthe article in the 'Quarterly Journal of Science,' inasmuch as it is\r\nthoroughly appreciative of your work: alas! you will probably agree with\r\nwhat the writer says about the uses of the bamboo.\r\n\r\nI hear that there is also a good article in the \"Saturday Review\", but\r\nhave heard nothing more about it. Believe me my dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nYours ever sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, May 4 [1869].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI have been applied to for some photographs (carte de visite) to be\r\ncopied to ornament the diplomas of honorary members of a new Society\r\nin Servia! Will you give me one for this purpose? I possess only a\r\nfull-length one of you in my own album, and the face is too small, I\r\nthink, to be copied.\r\n\r\nI hope that you get on well with your work, and have satisfied yourself\r\non the difficult point of glacier lakes. Thank heaven, I have finished\r\ncorrecting the new edition of the 'Origin,' and am at my old work of\r\nSexual Selection.\r\n\r\nWallace's article struck me as ADMIRABLE; how well he brought out the\r\nrevolution which you effected some 30 years ago. I thought I had fully\r\nappreciated the revolution, but I was astounded at the extracts from\r\nCuvier. What a good sketch of natural selection! but I was dreadfully\r\ndisappointed about Man, it seems to me incredibly strange...; and had I\r\nnot known to the contrary, would have sworn it had been inserted by some\r\nother hand. But I believe that you will not agree quite in all this.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell, ever yours sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.L.A. DE QUATREFAGES. Down, May 28 [1869 or 1870].\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have received and read your volume (Essays reprinted from the 'Revue\r\ndes Deux Mondes,' under the title 'Histoire Naturelle Generale,' etc.,\r\n1869.), and am much obliged for your present. The whole strikes me as a\r\nwonderfully clear and able discussion, and I was much interested by it\r\nto the last page. It is impossible that any account of my views could be\r\nfairer, or, as far as space permitted, fuller, than that which you\r\nhave given. The way in which you repeatedly mention my name is most\r\ngratifying to me. When I had finished the second part, I thought that\r\nyou had stated the case so favourably that you would make more converts\r\non my side than on your own side. On reading the subsequent parts I\r\nhad to change my sanguine view. In these latter parts many of your\r\nstrictures are severe enough, but all are given with perfect courtesy\r\nand fairness. I can truly say I would rather be criticised by you in\r\nthis manner than praised by many others. I agree with some of your\r\ncriticisms, but differ entirely from the remainder; but I will not\r\ntrouble you with any remarks. I may, however, say, that you must have\r\nbeen deceived by the French translation, as you infer that I believe\r\nthat the Parus and the Nuthatch (or Sitta) are related by direct\r\nfiliation. I wished only to show by an imaginary illustration, how\r\neither instincts or structures might first change. If you had seen Canis\r\nMagellanicus alive you would have perceived how foxlike its appearance\r\nis, or if you had heard its voice, I think that you would never have\r\nhazarded the idea that it was a domestic dog run wild; but this does\r\nnot much concern me. It is curious how nationality influences opinion; a\r\nweek hardly passes without my hearing of some naturalist in Germany\r\nwho supports my views, and often puts an exaggerated value on my works;\r\nwhilst in France I have not heard of a single zoologist, except M.\r\nGaudry (and he only partially), who supports my views. But I must have\r\na good many readers as my books are translated, and I must hope,\r\nnotwithstanding your strictures, that I may influence some embryo\r\nnaturalists in France.\r\n\r\nYou frequently speak of my good faith, and no compliment can be more\r\ndelightful to me, but I may return you the compliment with interest, for\r\nevery word which you write bears the stamp of your cordial love for the\r\ntruth. Believe me, dear Sir, with sincere respect,\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, October 14 [1869].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nI have been delighted to see your review of Haeckel (A review of\r\nHaeckel's 'Schopfungs-Geschichte.' The \"Academy\", 1869. Reprinted in\r\n'Critiques and Addresses,' page 303.), and as usual you pile honours\r\nhigh on my head. But I write now (REQUIRING NO ANSWER) to groan a\r\nlittle over what you have said about rudimentary organs. (In discussing\r\nTeleology and Haeckel's \"Dysteleology,\" Prof. Huxley says:--\"Such cases\r\nas the existence of lateral rudiments of toes, in the foot of a horse,\r\nplace us in a dilemma. For either these rudiments are of no use to the\r\nanimals, in which case... they surely ought to have disappeared; or\r\nthey are of some use to the animal, in which case they are of no use as\r\narguments against Teleology.\"--('Critiques and Addresses,' page 308.)\r\nMany heretics will take advantage of what you have said. I cannot but\r\nthink that the explanation given at page 541 of the last edition of\r\nthe 'Origin' of the long retention of rudimentary organs and of their\r\ngreater relative size during early life, is satisfactory. Their final\r\nand complete abortion seems to me a much greater difficulty. Do look\r\nin my 'Variations under Domestication,' volume ii. page 397, at what\r\nPangenesis suggests on this head, though I did not dare to put in the\r\n'Origin.' The passage bears also a little on the struggle between the\r\nmolecules or gemmules. (\"It is a probable hypothesis, that what the\r\nworld is to organisms in general, each organism is to the molecules of\r\nwhich it is composed. Multitudes of these having diverse tendencies, are\r\ncompeting with one another for opportunity to exist and multiply; and\r\nthe organism, as a whole, is as much the product of the molecules which\r\nare victorious as the Fauna, or Flora, of a country is the product of\r\nthe victorious organic beings in it.\"--('Critiques and Addresses,' page\r\n309.) There is likewise a word or two indirectly bearing on this subject\r\nat pages 394-395. It won't take you five minutes, so do look at these\r\npassages. I am very glad that you have been bold enough to give your\r\nidea about Natural Selection amongst the molecules, though I can not\r\nquite follow you.\r\n\r\n\r\n1870 AND BEGINNING OF 1871.\r\n\r\n[My father wrote in his Diary:--\"The whole of this year [1870] at work\r\non the 'Descent of Man.'... Went to Press August 30, 1870.\"\r\n\r\nThe letters are again of miscellaneous interest, dealing, not only with\r\nhis work, but also serving to indicate the course of his reading.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO E. RAY LANKESTER. Down, March 15 [1870].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI do not know whether you will consider me a very troublesome man, but\r\nI have just finished your book ('Comparative Longevity.'), and can not\r\nresist telling you how the whole has much interested me. No doubt, as\r\nyou say, there must be much speculation on such a subject, and certain\r\nresults can not be reached; but all your views are highly suggestive,\r\nand to my mind that is high praise. I have been all the more interested\r\nas I am now writing on closely allied though not quite identical points.\r\nI was pleased to see you refer to my much despised child, 'Pangenesis,'\r\nwho I think will some day, under some better nurse, turn out a fine\r\nstripling. It has also pleased me to see how thoroughly you appreciate\r\n(and I do not think that this is general with the men of science) H.\r\nSpencer; I suspect that hereafter he will be looked at as by far the\r\ngreatest living philosopher in England; perhaps equal to any that have\r\nlived. But I have no business to trouble you with my notions. With\r\nsincere thanks for the interest which your work has given me,\r\n\r\nI remain, yours very faithfully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The next letter refers to Mr. Wallace's 'Natural Selection' (1870), a\r\ncollection of essays reprinted with certain alterations of which a list\r\nis given in the volume:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, April 20 [1870].\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI have just received your book, and read the preface. There never has\r\nbeen passed on me, or indeed on any one, a higher eulogium than yours.\r\nI wish that I fully deserved it. Your modesty and candour are very far\r\nfrom new to me. I hope it is a satisfaction to you to reflect--and very\r\nfew things in my life have been more satisfactory to me--that we have\r\nnever felt any jealousy towards each other, though in one sense rivals.\r\nI believe that I can say this of myself with truth, and I am absolutely\r\nsure that it is true of you.\r\n\r\nYou have been a good Christian to give a list of your additions, for\r\nI want much to read them, and I should hardly have had time just at\r\npresent to have gone through all your articles. Of course I shall\r\nimmediately read those that are new or greatly altered, and I will\r\nendeavour to be as honest as can reasonably be expected. Your book looks\r\nremarkably well got up.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Wallace, to remain, Yours very cordially, CH.\r\nDARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Here follow one or two letters indicating the progress of the 'Descent\r\nof Man;' the woodcuts referred to were being prepared for that work:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A. GUNTHER. (Dr. Gunther, Keeper of Zoology in the\r\nBritish Museum.) March 23, [1870?].\r\n\r\nDear Gunther,\r\n\r\nAs I do not know Mr. Ford's address, will you hand him this note, which\r\nis written solely to express my unbounded admiration of the woodcuts.\r\nI fairly gloat over them. The only evil is that they will make all\r\nthe other woodcuts look very poor! They are all excellent, and for the\r\nfeathers I declare I think it the most wonderful woodcut I ever saw; I\r\ncan not help touching it to make sure that it is smooth. How I wish to\r\nsee the two other, and even more important, ones of the feathers, and\r\nthe four [of] reptiles, etc. Once again accept my very sincere thanks\r\nfor all your kindness. I am greatly indebted to Mr. Ford. Engravings\r\nhave always hitherto been my greatest misery, and now they are a real\r\npleasure to me.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I thought I should have been in press by this time, but my subject\r\nhas branched off into sub-branches, which have cost me infinite time,\r\nand heaven knows when I shall have all my MS. ready, but I am never\r\nidle.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A. GUNTHER. May 15 [1870].\r\n\r\nMy dear Dr. Gunther,\r\n\r\nSincere thanks. Your answers are wonderfully clear and complete. I have\r\nsome analogous questions on reptiles, etc., which I will send in a few\r\ndays, and then I think I shall cause no more trouble. I will get the\r\nbooks you refer me to. The case of the Solenostoma (In most of the\r\nLophobranchii the male has a marsupial sack in which the eggs are\r\nhatched, and in these species the male is slightly brighter coloured\r\nthan the female. But in Solenostoma the female is the hatcher, and\r\nis also the more brightly coloured.--'Descent of Man,' ii. 21.) is\r\nmagnificent, so exactly analogous to that of those birds in which the\r\nfemale is the more gay, but ten times better for me, as she is the\r\nincubator. As I crawl on with the successive classes I am astonished to\r\nfind how similar the rules are about the nuptial or \"wedding dress\" of\r\nall animals. The subject has begun to interest me in an extraordinary\r\ndegree; but I must try not to fall into my common error of being too\r\nspeculative. But a drunkard might as well say he would drink a little\r\nand not too much! My essay, as far as fishes, batrachians and reptiles\r\nare concerned, will be in fact yours, only written by me. With hearty\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter is of interest, as showing the excessive care and\r\npains which my father took in forming his opinion on a difficult point:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, September 23 [undated].\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for all your trouble in writing me your long\r\nletter, which I will keep by me and ponder over. To answer it would\r\nrequire at least 200 folio pages! If you could see how often I have\r\nre-written some pages you would know how anxious I am to arrive as near\r\nas I can to the truth. I lay great stress on what I know takes place\r\nunder domestication; I think we start with different fundamental notions\r\non inheritance. I find it is most difficult, but not I think impossible,\r\nto see how, for instance, a few red feathers appearing on the head of a\r\nmale bird, and which ARE AT FIRST TRANSMITTED TO BOTH SEXES, could come\r\nto be transmitted to males alone. It is not enough that females should\r\nbe produced from the males with red feathers, which should be destitute\r\nof red feathers; but these females must have a LATENT TENDENCY to\r\nproduce such feathers, otherwise they would cause deterioration in the\r\nred head-feathers of their male offspring. Such latent tendency would be\r\nshown by their producing the red feathers when old, or diseased in their\r\novaria. But I have no difficulty in making the whole head red if the\r\nfew red feathers in the male from the first tended to be sexually\r\ntransmitted. I am quite willing to admit that the female may have been\r\nmodified, either at the same time or subsequently, for protection by the\r\naccumulation of variations limited in their transmission to the female\r\nsex. I owe to your writings the consideration of this latter point. But\r\nI cannot yet persuade myself that females ALONE have often been modified\r\nfor protection. Should you grudge the trouble briefly to tell me whether\r\nyou believe that the plainer head and less bright colours of a female\r\nchaffinch, the less red on the head and less clean colours of the female\r\ngoldfinch, the much less red on the breast of the female bull-finch, the\r\npaler crest of golden-crested wren, etc., have been acquired by them for\r\nprotection. I cannot think so any more than I can that the considerable\r\ndifferences between female and male house sparrow, or much greater\r\nbrightness of the male Parus coeruleus (both of which build under cover)\r\nthan of the female Parus, are related to protection. I even mis-doubt\r\nmuch whether the less blackness of the female blackbird is for\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nAgain, can you give me reasons for believing that the moderate\r\ndifferences between the female pheasant, the female Gallus bankiva,\r\nthe female black grouse, the pea-hen, the female partridge, [and their\r\nrespective males,] have all special references to protection under\r\nslightly different conditions? I, of course, admit that they are all\r\nprotected by dull colours, derived, as I think, from some dull-ground\r\nprogenitor; and I account partly for their difference by partial\r\ntransference of colour from the male and by other means too long to\r\nspecify; but I earnestly wish to see reason to believe that each is\r\nspecially adapted for concealment to its environment.\r\n\r\nI grieve to differ from you, and it actually terrifies me and makes me\r\nconstantly distrust myself. I fear we shall never quite understand each\r\nother. I value the cases of bright-coloured, incubating male fishes, and\r\nbrilliant female butterflies, solely as showing that one sex may be made\r\nbrilliant without any necessary transference of beauty to the other sex;\r\nfor in these cases I cannot suppose that beauty in the other sex was\r\nchecked by selection.\r\n\r\nI fear this letter will trouble you to read it. A very short answer\r\nabout your belief in regard to the female finches and gallinaceae would\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Wallace, Yours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 25 [1870].\r\n\r\n... Last Friday we all went to the Bull Hotel at Cambridge to see the\r\nboys, and for a little rest and enjoyment. The backs of the Colleges are\r\nsimply paradisaical. On Monday I saw Sedgwick, who was most cordial and\r\nkind; in the morning I thought his brain was enfeebled; in the evening\r\nhe was brilliant and quite himself. His affection and kindness charmed\r\nus all. My visit to him was in one way unfortunate; for after a long\r\nsit he proposed to take me to the museum, and I could not refuse, and\r\nin consequence he utterly prostrated me; so that we left Cambridge\r\nnext morning, and I have not recovered the exhaustion yet. Is it not\r\nhumiliating to be thus killed by a man of eighty-six, who evidently\r\nnever dreamed that he was killing me? As he said to me, \"Oh, I consider\r\nyou as a mere baby to me!\" I saw Newton several times, and several nice\r\nfriends of F.'s. But Cambridge without dear Henslow was not itself; I\r\ntried to get to the two old houses, but it was too far for me...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO B.J. SULIVAN. (Admiral Sir James Sulivan was a\r\nlieutenant on board the \"Beagle\".) Down, June 30 [1870].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sulivan,\r\n\r\nIt was very good of you to write to me so long a letter, telling me much\r\nabout yourself and your children, which I was extremely glad to hear.\r\nThink what a benighted wretch I am, seeing no one and reading but little\r\nin the newspapers, for I did not know (until seeing the paper of your\r\nNatural History Society) that you were a K.C.B. Most heartily glad I am\r\nthat the Government have at last appreciated your most just claim for\r\nthis high distinction. On the other hand, I am sorry to hear so poor an\r\naccount of your health; but you were surely very rash to do all that you\r\ndid and then pass through so exciting a scene as a ball at the Palace.\r\nIt was enough to have tired a man in robust health. Complete rest will,\r\nhowever, I hope, quite set you up again. As for myself, I have been\r\nrather better of late, and if nothing disturbs me I can do some hours'\r\nwork every day. I shall this autumn publish another book partly on man,\r\nwhich I dare say many will decry as very wicked. I could have travelled\r\nto Oxford, but could no more have withstood the excitement of a\r\ncommemoration (This refers to an invitation to receive the honorary\r\ndegree of D.C.L. He was one of those nominated for the degree by Lord\r\nSalisbury on assuming the office of Chancellor of the University of\r\nOxford. The fact that the honour was declined on the score of ill-health\r\nwas published in the \"Oxford University Gazette\", June 17, 1870.) than\r\nI could a ball at Buckingham Palace. Many thanks for your kind remarks\r\nabout my boys. Thank God, all give me complete satisfaction; my fourth\r\nstands second at Woolwich, and will be an Engineer Officer at Christmas.\r\nMy wife desires to be very kindly remembered to Lady Sulivan, in which\r\nI very sincerely join, and in congratulation about your daughter's\r\nmarriage. We are at present solitary, for all our younger children are\r\ngone a tour in Switzerland. I had never heard a word about the success\r\nof the T. del Fuego mission. It is most wonderful, and shames me, as\r\nI always prophesied utter failure. It is a grand success. I shall feel\r\nproud if your Committee think fit to elect me an honorary member of your\r\nsociety. With all good wishes and affectionate remembrances of ancient\r\ndays,\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Sulivan, Your sincere friend, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[My father's connection with the South American Mission, which is\r\nreferred to in the above letter, has given rise to some public comment,\r\nand has been to some extent misunderstood. The Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nspeaking at the annual meeting of the South American Missionary Society,\r\nApril 21st, 1885 (I quote a 'Leaflet,' published by the Society.), said\r\nthat the Society \"drew the attention of Charles Darwin, and made him, in\r\nhis pursuit of the wonders of the kingdom of nature, realise that there\r\nwas another kingdom just as wonderful and more lasting.\" Some discussion\r\non the subject appeared in the \"Daily News\" of April 23rd, 24th, 29th,\r\n1885, and finally Admiral Sir James Sulivan, on April 24th, wrote to the\r\nsame journal, giving a clear account of my father's connection with the\r\nSociety:--\r\n\r\n\"Your article in the \"Daily News\" of yesterday induces me to give you\r\na correct statement of the connection between the South American\r\nMissionary Society and Mr. Charles Darwin, my old friend and shipmate\r\nfor five years. I have been closely connected with the Society from\r\nthe time of Captain Allen Gardiner's death, and Mr. Darwin has often\r\nexpressed to me his conviction that it was utterly useless to send\r\nMissionaries to such a set of savages as the Fuegians, probably the very\r\nlowest of the human race. I had always replied that I did not believe\r\nany human beings existed too low to comprehend the simple message of the\r\nGospel of Christ. After many years, I think about 1869 (It seems to have\r\nbeen in 1867.), but I cannot find the letter, he wrote to me that the\r\nrecent accounts of the Mission proved to him that he had been wrong and\r\nI right in our estimates of the native character, and the possibility of\r\ndoing them good through Missionaries; and he requested me to forward\r\nto the Society an enclosed cheque for 5 pounds, as a testimony of the\r\ninterest he took in their good work. On June 6th, 1874, he wrote: 'I\r\nam very glad to hear so good an account of the Fuegians, and it is\r\nwonderful.' On June 10th, 1879: 'The progress of the Fuegians is\r\nwonderful, and had it not occurred would have been to me quite\r\nincredible.' On January 3rd, 1880: 'Your extracts' [from a journal]\r\n'about the Fuegians are extremely curious, and have interested me much.\r\nI have often said that the progress of Japan was the greatest wonder in\r\nthe world, but I declare that the progress of Fuegia is almost equally\r\nwonderful. On March 20th, 1881: 'The account of the Fuegians interested\r\nnot only me, but all my family. It is truly wonderful what you have\r\nheard from Mr. Bridges about their honesty and their language. I\r\ncertainly should have predicted that not all the Missionaries in the\r\nworld could have done what has been done.' On December 1st, 1881,\r\nsending me his annual subscription to the Orphanage at the Mission\r\nStation, he wrote: 'Judging from the \"Missionary Journal\", the Mission\r\nin Tierra del Fuego seems going on quite wonderfully well.'\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO JOHN LUBBOCK. Down, July 17, 1870.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lubbock,\r\n\r\nAs I hear that the Census will be brought before the House to-morrow, I\r\nwrite to say how much I hope that you will express your opinion on the\r\ndesirability of queries in relation to consanguineous marriages being\r\ninserted. As you are aware, I have made experiments on the subject\r\nduring several years; AND IT IS MY CLEAR CONVICTION THAT THERE IS NOW\r\nAMPLE EVIDENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A GREAT PHYSIOLOGICAL LAW, RENDERING\r\nAN ENQUIRY WITH REFERENCE TO MANKIND OF MUCH IMPORTANCE. IN ENGLAND AND\r\nMANY PARTS OF EUROPE THE MARRIAGES OF COUSINS ARE OBJECTED TO FROM THEIR\r\nSUPPOSED INJURIOUS CONSEQUENCES; BUT THIS BELIEF RESTS ON NO DIRECT\r\nEVIDENCE. IT IS THEREFORE MANIFESTLY DESIRABLE THAT THE BELIEF SHOULD\r\nEITHER BE PROVED FALSE, OR SHOULD BE CONFIRMED, so that in this latter\r\ncase the marriages of cousins might be discouraged. If the proper\r\nqueries are inserted, the returns would show whether married cousins\r\nhave in their households on the night of the census as many children as\r\nhave parents of who are not related; and should the number prove fewer,\r\nwe might safely infer either lessened fertility in the parents, or which\r\nis more probable, lessened vitality in the offspring.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, much to be wished that the truth of the often repeated\r\nassertion that consanguineous marriages lead to deafness, and dumbness,\r\nblindness, etc., should be ascertained; and all such assertions could be\r\neasily tested by the returns from a single census.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, Yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[When the Census Act was passing through the House of Commons, Sir John\r\nLubbock and Dr. Playfair attempted to carry out this suggestion. The\r\nquestion came to a division, which was lost, but not by many votes.\r\n\r\nThe subject of cousin marriages was afterwards investigated by my\r\nbrother. (\"Marriages between First Cousins in England, and their\r\nEffects.' By George Darwin. 'Journal of the Statistical Society,' June,\r\n1875.) The results of this laborious piece of work were negative; the\r\nauthor sums up in the sentence:--\r\n\r\n\"My paper is far from giving any thing like a satisfactory solution of\r\nthe question as to the effects of consanguineous marriages, but it does,\r\nI think, show that the assertion that this question has already been set\r\nat rest, cannot be substantiated.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.VII. -- PUBLICATION OF THE 'DESCENT OF MAN.'\r\n\r\nWORK ON 'EXPRESSION.'\r\n\r\n1871-1873.\r\n\r\n[The last revise of the 'Descent of Man' was corrected on January 15th,\r\n1871, so that the book occupied him for about three years. He wrote to\r\nSir J. Hooker: \"I finished the last proofs of my book a few days ago,\r\nthe work half-killed me, and I have not the most remote idea whether the\r\nbook is worth publishing.\"\r\n\r\nHe also wrote to Dr. Gray:--\r\n\r\n\"I have finished my book on the 'Descent of Man,' etc., and its\r\npublication is delayed only by the Index: when published, I will send\r\nyou a copy, but I do not know that you will care about it. Parts, as\r\non the moral sense, will, I dare say, aggravate you, and if I hear from\r\nyou, I shall probably receive a few stabs from your polished stiletto of\r\na pen.\"\r\n\r\nThe book was published on February 24, 1871. 2500 copies were printed at\r\nfirst, and 5000 more before the end of the year. My father notes that he\r\nreceived for this edition 1470 pounds. The letters given in the present\r\nchapter deal with its reception, and also with the progress of the work\r\non Expression. The letters are given, approximately, in chronological\r\norder, an arrangement which necessarily separates letters of kindred\r\nsubjec-matter, but gives perhaps a truer picture of the mingled\r\ninterests and labours of my father's life.\r\n\r\nNothing can give a better idea (in small compass) of the growth of\r\nEvolutionism and its position at this time, than a quotation from Mr.\r\nHuxley ('Contemporary Review,' 1871.):--\r\n\r\n\"The gradual lapse of time has now separated us by more than a decade\r\nfrom the date of the publication of the 'Origin of Species;' and\r\nwhatever may be thought or said about Mr. Darwin's doctrines, or the\r\nmanner in which he has propounded them, this much is certain, that in a\r\ndozen years the 'Origin of Species' has worked as complete a revolution\r\nin Biological Science as the 'Principia' did in Astronomy;\" and it\r\nhas done so, \"because, in the words of Helmholtz, it contains 'an\r\nessentially new creative thought.' And, as time has slipped by, a happy\r\nchange has come over Mr. Darwin's critics. The mixture of ignorance and\r\ninsolence which at first characterised a large proportion of the\r\nattacks with which he was assailed, is no longer the sad distinction of\r\nanti-Darwinian criticism.\"\r\n\r\nA passage in the Introduction to the 'Descent of Man' shows that the\r\nauthor recognised clearly this improvement in the position of Evolution.\r\n\"When a naturalist like Carl Vogt ventures to say in his address, as\r\nPresident of the National Institution of Geneva (1869), 'personne en\r\nEurope au moins, n'ose plus soutenir la creation independante et de\r\ntoutes pieces, des especes,' it is manifest that at least a large number\r\nof naturalists must admit that species are the modified descendants\r\nof other species; and this especially holds good with the younger\r\nand rising naturalists... Of the older and honoured chiefs in natural\r\nscience, many, unfortunately, are still opposed to Evolution in every\r\nform.\"\r\n\r\nIn Mr. James Hague's pleasantly written article, \"A Reminiscence of Mr.\r\nDarwin\" ('Harper's Magazine,' October 1884), he describes a visit to my\r\nfather \"early in 1871\" (it must have been at the end of February,\r\nwithin a week after the publication of the book.), shortly after the\r\npublication of the 'Descent of Man.' Mr. Hague represents my father\r\nas \"much impressed by the general assent with which his views had been\r\nreceived,\" and as remarking that \"everybody is talking about it without\r\nbeing shocked.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the year the reception of the book is described in different\r\nlanguage in the 'Edinburgh Review' (July 1871. An adverse criticism.\r\nThe reviewer sums up by saying that: \"Never perhaps in the history of\r\nphilosophy have such wide generalisations been derived from such a small\r\nbasis of fact.\"): \"On every side it is raising a storm of mingled wrath,\r\nwonder, and admiration.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the subsequent reception of the 'Descent of Man,' my\r\nfather wrote to Dr. Dohrn, February 3, 1872:--\r\n\r\n\"I did not know until reading your article (In 'Das Ausland.'), that my\r\n'Descent of Man' had excited so much furore in Germany. It has had an\r\nimmense circulation in this country and in America, but has met the\r\napproval of hardly any naturalists as far as I know. Therefore I suppose\r\nit was a mistake on my part to publish it; but, anyhow, it will pave the\r\nway for some better work.\"\r\n\r\nThe book on the 'Expression of the Emotions' was begun on January 17th,\r\n1871, the last proof of the 'Descent of Man' having been finished on\r\nJanuary 15th. The rough copy was finished by April 27th, and shortly\r\nafter this (in June) the work was interrupted by the preparation of a\r\nsixth edition of the 'Origin.' In November and December the proofs of\r\nthe 'Expression' book were taken in hand, and occupied him until the\r\nfollowing year, when the book was published.\r\n\r\nSome references to the work on Expression have occurred in letters\r\nalready given, showing that the foundation of the book was, to some\r\nextent, laid down for some years before he began to write it. Thus he\r\nwrote to Dr. Asa Gray, April 15, 1867:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been lately getting up and looking over my old notes on\r\nExpression, and fear that I shall not make so much of my hobby-horse as\r\nI thought I could; nevertheless, it seems to me a curious subject which\r\nhas been strangely neglected.\"\r\n\r\nIt should, however, be remembered that the subject had been before his\r\nmind, more or less, from 1837 or 1838, as I judge from entries in\r\nhis early note-books. It was in December, 1839, that he began to make\r\nobservations on children.\r\n\r\nThe work required much correspondence, not only with missionaries and\r\nothers living among savages, to whom he sent his printed queries, but\r\namong physiologists and physicians. He obtained much information from\r\nProfessor Donders, Sir W. Bowman, Sir James Paget, Dr. W. Ogle, Dr.\r\nCrichton Browne, as well as from other observers.\r\n\r\nThe first letter refers to the 'Descent of Man.']\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, January 30 [1871].\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\n(In the note referred to, dated January 27, Mr. Wallace wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"Many thanks for your first volume which I have just finished reading\r\nthrough with the greatest pleasure and interest; and I have also to\r\nthank you for the great tenderness with which you have treated me and my\r\nheresies.\"\r\n\r\nThe heresy is the limitation of natural selection as applied to man.\r\nMy father wrote ('Descent of Man,' i. page 137):--\"I cannot therefore\r\nunderstand how it is that Mr. Wallace maintains that 'natural selection\r\ncould only have endowed the savage with a brain a little superior to\r\nthat of an ape.'\" In the above quoted letter Mr. Wallace wrote:--\"Your\r\nchapters on 'Man' are of intense interest, but as touching my special\r\nheresy not as yet altogether convincing, though of course I fully agree\r\nwith every word and every argument which goes to prove the evolution or\r\ndevelopment of man out of a lower form.\")\r\n\r\nYour note has given me very great pleasure, chiefly because I was\r\nso anxious not to treat you with the least disrespect, and it is so\r\ndifficult to speak fairly when differing from any one. If I had offended\r\nyou, it would have grieved me more than you will readily believe.\r\nSecondly, I am greatly pleased to hear that Volume I. interests you; I\r\nhave got so sick of the whole subject that I felt in utter doubt about\r\nthe value of any part. I intended, when speaking of females not having\r\nbeen specially modified for protection, to include the prevention of\r\ncharacters acquired by the male being transmitted to the female; but I\r\nnow see it would have been better to have said \"specially acted on,\" or\r\nsome such term. Possibly my intention may be clearer in Volume II. Let\r\nme say that my conclusions are chiefly founded on the consideration of\r\nall animals taken in a body, bearing in mind how common the rules of\r\nsexual differences appear to be in all classes. The first copy of the\r\nchapter on Lepidoptera agreed pretty closely with you. I then worked\r\non, came back to Lepidoptera, and thought myself compelled to\r\nalter it--finished Sexual Selection and for the last time went over\r\nLepidoptera, and again I felt forced to alter it. I hope to God there\r\nwill be nothing disagreeable to you in Volume II., and that I have\r\nspoken fairly of your views; I am fearful on this head, because I have\r\njust read (but not with sufficient care) Mivart's book ('The Genesis of\r\nSpecies,' by St. G. Mivart, 1871.), and I feel ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that\r\nhe meant to be fair (but he was stimulated by theological fervour); yet\r\nI do not think he has been quite fair... The part which, I think, will\r\nhave most influence is where he gives the whole series of cases like\r\nthat of the whalebone, in which we cannot explain the gradational steps;\r\nbut such cases have no weight on my mind--if a few fish were extinct,\r\nwho on earth would have ventured even to conjecture that lungs had\r\noriginated in a swi-bladder? In such a case as the Thylacine, I think he\r\nwas bound to say that the resemblance of the jaw to that of the dog\r\nis superficial; the number and correspondence and development of teeth\r\nbeing widely different. I think again when speaking of the necessity of\r\naltering a number of characters together, he ought to have thought\r\nof man having power by selection to modify simultaneously or almost\r\nsimultaneously many points, as in making a greyhound or racehorse--as\r\nenlarged upon in my 'Domestic Animals.' Mivart is savage or contemptuous\r\nabout my \"moral sense,\" and so probably will you be. I am extremely\r\npleased that he agrees with my position, AS FAR AS ANIMAL NATURE IS\r\nCONCERNED, of man in the series; or if anything, thinks I have erred in\r\nmaking him too distinct.\r\n\r\nForgive me for scribbling at such length. You have put me quite in good\r\nspirits; I did so dread having been unintentionally unfair towards your\r\nviews. I hope earnestly the second volume will escape as well. I care\r\nnow very little what others say. As for our not quite agreeing, really\r\nin such complex subjects, it is almost impossible for two men who arrive\r\nindependently at their conclusions to agree fully, it would be unnatural\r\nfor them to do so.\r\n\r\nYours ever, very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Professor Haeckel seems to have been one of the first to write to my\r\nfather about the 'Descent of Man.' I quote from his reply:--\r\n\r\n\"I must send you a few words to thank you for your interesting, and I\r\nmay truly say, charming letter. I am delighted that you approve of my\r\nbook, as far as you have read it. I felt very great difficulty and\r\ndoubt how often I ought to allude to what you have published; strictly\r\nspeaking every idea, although occurring independently to me, if\r\npublished by you previously ought to have appeared as if taken from your\r\nworks, but this would have made my book very dull reading; and I hoped\r\nthat a full acknowledgment at the beginning would suffice. (In the\r\nintroduction to the 'Descent of Man' the author wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"This last naturalist [Haeckel]... has recently... published his\r\n'Naturliche Schopfungs-geschichte,' in which he fully discusses the\r\ngenealogy of man. If this work had appeared before my essay had been\r\nwritten, I should probably never have completed it. Almost all\r\nthe conclusions at which I have arrived, I find confirmed by this\r\nnaturalist, whose knowledge on many points is much fuller than mine.\")\r\nI cannot tell you how glad I am to find that I have expressed my high\r\nadmiration of your labours with sufficient clearness; I am sure that I\r\nhave not expressed it too strongly.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, March 16, 1871.\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI have just read your grand review. (\"Academy\", March 15, 1871.) It is\r\nin every way as kindly expressed towards myself as it is excellent in\r\nmatter. The Lyells have been here, and Sir C. remarked that no one wrote\r\nsuch good scientific reviews as you, and as Miss Buckley added, you\r\ndelight in picking out all that is good, though very far from blind to\r\nthe bad. In all this I most entirely agree. I shall always consider\r\nyour review as a great honour; and however much my book may hereafter\r\nbe abused, as no doubt it will be, your review will console me,\r\nnotwithstanding that we differ so greatly. I will keep your objections\r\nto my views in my mind, but I fear that the latter are almost\r\nstereotyped in my mind. I thought for long weeks about the inheritance\r\nand selection difficulty, and covered quires of paper with notes in\r\ntrying to get out of it, but could not, though clearly seeing that it\r\nwould be a great relief if I could. I will confine myself to two or\r\nthree remarks. I have been much impressed with what you urge against\r\ncolour (Mr. Wallace says that the pairing of butterflies is probably\r\ndetermined by the fact that one male is stronger-winged, or more\r\npertinacious than the rest, rather than by the choice of the females.\r\nHe quotes the case of caterpillars which are brightly coloured and yet\r\nsexless. Mr. Wallace also makes the good criticism that the 'Descent\r\nof Man' consists of two books mixed together.) in the case of insects,\r\nhaving been acquired through sexual selection. I always saw that the\r\nevidence was very weak; but I still think, if it be admitted that\r\nthe musical instruments of insects have been gained through sexual\r\nselection, that there is not the least improbability in colour having\r\nbeen thus gained. Your argument with respect to the denudation of\r\nmankind and also to insects, that taste on the part of one sex would\r\nhave to remain nearly the same during many generations, in order that\r\nsexual selection should produce any effect, I agree to; and I think this\r\nargument would be sound if used by one who denied that, for instance,\r\nthe plumes of birds of Paradise had been so gained. I believe you admit\r\nthis, and if so I do not see how your argument applies in other cases. I\r\nhave recognized for some short time that I have made a great omission in\r\nnot having discussed, as far as I could, the acquisition of taste, its\r\ninherited nature, and its permanence within pretty close limits for long\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n\r\n[With regard to the success of the 'Descent of Man,' I quote from a\r\nletter to Professor Ray Lankester (March 22, 1871):--\r\n\r\n\"I think you will be glad to hear, as a proof of the increasing\r\nliberality of England, that my book has sold wonderfully... and as yet\r\nno abuse (though some, no doubt, will come, strong enough), and only\r\ncontempt even in the poor old 'Athenaeum'.\"\r\n\r\nAs to reviews that struck him he wrote to Mr. Wallace (March 24,\r\n1871):--\r\n\r\n\"There is a very striking second article on my book in the 'Pall Mall'.\r\nThe articles in the \"Spectator\" (\"Spectator\", March 11 and 18, 1871.\r\nWith regard to the evolution of conscience the reviewer thinks that my\r\nfather comes much nearer to the \"kernel of the psychological problem\"\r\nthan many of his predecessors. The second article contains a good\r\ndiscussion of the bearing of the book on the question of design, and\r\nconcludes by finding in it a vindication of Theism more wonderful than\r\nthat in Paley's 'Natural Theology.') have also interested me much.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 20 he wrote to Mr. Murray:--\r\n\r\n\"Many thanks for the \"Nonconformist\" [March 8, 1871]. I like to see all\r\nthat is written, and it is of some real use. If you hear of reviewers\r\nin out-of-the-way papers, especially the religious, as \"Record\",\r\n\"Guardian\", \"Tablet\", kindly inform me. It is wonderful that there has\r\nbeen no abuse (\"I feel a full conviction that my chapter on man will\r\nexcite attention and plenty of abuse, and I suppose abuse is as good as\r\npraise for selling a book.\"--(from a letter to Mr. Murray, January\r\n31, 1867.) as yet, but I suppose I shall not escape. On the whole, the\r\nreviews have been highly favourable.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter to Mr. Murray (April 13, 1871)\r\nrefers to a review in the \"Times\". (\"Times\", April 7 and 8, 1871. The\r\nreview is not only unfavourable as regards the book under discussion,\r\nbut also as regards Evolution in general, as the following citation will\r\nshow: \"Even had it been rendered highly probable, which we doubt, that\r\nthe animal creation has been developed into its numerous and widely\r\ndifferent varieties by mere evolution, it would still require an\r\nindependent investigation of overwhelming force and completeness to\r\njustify the presumption that man is but a term in this self-evolving\r\nseries.\")\r\n\r\n\"I have no idea who wrote the \"Times\" review. He has no knowledge of\r\nscience, and seems to me a wind-bag full of metaphysics and classics, so\r\nthat I do not much regard his adverse judgment, though I suppose it will\r\ninjure the sale.\"\r\n\r\nA review of the 'Descent of Man,' which my father spoke of as \"capital,\"\r\nappeared in the \"Saturday Review\" (March 4 and 11, 1871). A passage from\r\nthe first notice (March 4) may be quoted in illustration of the broad\r\nbasis as regards general acceptance, on which the doctrine of Evolution\r\nnow stood: \"He claims to have brought man himself, his origin and\r\nconstitution, within that unity which he had previously sought to trace\r\nthrough all lower animal forms. The growth of opinion in the interval,\r\ndue in chief measure to his own intermediate works, has placed the\r\ndiscussion of this problem in a position very much in advance of that\r\nheld by it fifteen years ago. The problem of Evolution is hardly any\r\nlonger to be treated as one of first principles; nor has Mr. Darwin to\r\ndo battle for a first hearing of his central hypothesis, upborne as\r\nit is by a phalanx of names full of distinction and promise, in either\r\nhemisphere.\"\r\n\r\nThe infolded point of the human ear, discovered by Mr. Woolner, and\r\ndescribed in the 'Descent of Man,' seems especially to have struck the\r\npopular imagination; my father wrote to Mr. Woolner:--\r\n\r\n\"The tips to the ears have become quite celebrated. One reviewer\r\n('Nature') says they ought to be called, as I suggested in joke, Angulus\r\nWoolnerianus. ('Nature' April 6, 1871. The term suggested is Angulus\r\nWoolnerii.) A German is very proud to find that he has the tips well\r\ndeveloped, and I believe will send me a photograph of his ears.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO JOHN BRODIE INNES. (Rev. J. Brodie Innes, of Milton\r\nBrodie, formerly Vicar of Down.) Down, May 29 [1871].\r\n\r\nMy dear Innes,\r\n\r\nI have been very glad to receive your pleasant letter, for to tell you\r\nthe truth, I have sometimes wondered whether you would not think me\r\nan outcast and a reprobate after the publication of my last book\r\n['Descent']. (In a former letter of my father's to Mr. Innes:--\"We often\r\ndiffered, but you are one of those rare mortals from whom one can differ\r\nand yet feel no shade of animosity, and that is a thing which I should\r\nfeel very proud of, if any one could say it of me.\") I do not wonder at\r\nall at your not agreeing with me, for a good many professed naturalists\r\ndo not. Yet when I see in how extraordinary a manner the judgment of\r\nnaturalists has changed since I published the 'Origin,' I feel convinced\r\nthat there will be in ten years quite as much unanimity about man, as\r\nfar as his corporeal frame is concerned...\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letters addressed to Dr. Ogle deal with the progress of\r\nthe work on expression.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDown, March 12 [1871].\r\n\r\nMy dear Dr. Ogle,\r\n\r\nI have received both your letters, and they tell me all that I wanted\r\nto know in the clearest possible way, as, indeed, all your letters have\r\never done. I thank you cordially. I will give the case of the murderer\r\n('Expression of the Emotions,' page 294. The arrest of a murderer,\r\nas witnessed by Dr. Ogle in a hospital.) in my hobby-horse essay on\r\nexpression. I fear that the Eustachian tube question must have cost\r\nyou a deal of labour; it is quite a complete little essay. It is pretty\r\nclear that the mouth is not opened under surprise merely to improve the\r\nhearing. Yet why do deaf men generally keep their mouths open? The other\r\nday a man here was mimicking a deaf friend, leaning his head forward\r\nand sideways to the speaker, with his mouth well open; it was a lifelike\r\nrepresentation of a deaf man. Shakespeare somewhere says: \"Hold your\r\nbreath, listen\" or \"hark,\" I forget which. Surprise hurries the breath,\r\nand it seems to me one can breathe, at least hurriedly, much quieter\r\nthrough the open mouth than through the nose. I saw the other day\r\nyou doubted this. As objection is your province at present, I think\r\nbreathing through the nose ought to come within it likewise, so do pray\r\nconsider this point, and let me hear your judgment. Consider the nose to\r\nbe a flower to be fertilised, and then you will make out all about it.\r\n(Dr. Ogle had corresponded with my father on his own observations on the\r\nfertilisation of flowers.) I have had to allude to your paper on 'Sense\r\nof Smell' (Medico-chirurg. Trans. liii.); is the paging right, namely,\r\n1, 2, 3? If not, I protest by all the gods against the plan followed\r\nby some, of having presentation copies falsely paged; and so does\r\nRolleston, as he wrote to me the other day. In haste.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W. OGLE. Down, March 25 [1871].\r\n\r\nMy dear Dr. Ogle,\r\n\r\nYou will think me a horrid bore, but I beg you, IN RELATION TO A NEW\r\nPOINT FOR OBSERVATION, to imagine as well as you can that you suddenly\r\ncome across some dreadful object, and act with a sudden little start, a\r\nSHUDDER OF HORROR; please do this once or twice, and observe yourself as\r\nwell as you can, and AFTERWARDS read the rest of this note, which I have\r\nconsequently pinned down. I find, to my surprise, whenever I act thus\r\nmy platysma contracts. Does yours? (N.B.--See what a man will do for\r\nscience; I began this note with a horrid fib, namely, that I want you to\r\nattend to a new point. (The point was doubtless described as a new one,\r\nto avoid the possibility of Dr. Ogle's attention being directed to the\r\nplatysma, a muscle which had been the subject of discussion in other\r\nletters.)) I will try and get some persons thus to act who are so lucky\r\nas not to know that they even possess this muscle, so troublesome for\r\nany one making out about expression. Is a shudder akin to the rigor or\r\nshivering before fever? If so, perhaps the platysma could be observed\r\nin such cases. Paget told me that he had attended much to shivering, and\r\nhad written in MS. on the subject, and been much perplexed about it. He\r\nmentioned that passing a catheter often causes shivering. Perhaps I will\r\nwrite to him about the platysma. He is always most kind in aiding me in\r\nall ways, but he is so overworked that it hurts my conscience to trouble\r\nhim, for I have a conscience, little as you have reason to think so.\r\nHelp me if you can, and forgive me. Your murderer case has come in\r\nsplendidly as the acme of prostration from fear.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO DR. OGLE. Down, April 29 [1871].\r\n\r\nMy dear Dr. Ogle,\r\n\r\nI am truly obliged for all the great trouble which you have so kindly\r\ntaken. I am sure you have no cause to say that you are sorry you can\r\ngive me no definite information, for you have given me far more than I\r\never expected to get. The action of the platysma is not very important\r\nfor me, but I believe that you will fully understand (for I have always\r\nfancied that our minds were very similar) the intolerable desire I had\r\nnot to be utterly baffled. Now I know that it sometimes contracts from\r\nfear and from shuddering, but not apparently from a prolonged state of\r\nfear such as the insane suffer...\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mr. Mivart's 'Genesis of Species,'--a contribution to the literature of\r\nEvolution, which excited much attention--was published in 1871, before\r\nthe appearance of the 'Descent of Man.' To this book the following\r\nletter (June 21, 1871) from the late Chauncey Wright to my father\r\nrefers. (Chauncey Wright was born at Northampton, Massachusetts,\r\nSeptember 20, 1830, and came of a family settled in that town since\r\n1654. He became in 1852 a computer in the Nautical Almanac office at\r\nCambridge, Mass., and lived a quiet uneventful life, supported by the\r\nsmall stipend of his office, and by what he earned from his occasional\r\narticles, as well as by a little teaching. He thought and read much on\r\nmetaphysical subjects, but on the whole with an outcome (as far as the\r\nworld was concerned) not commensurate to the power of his mind. He seems\r\nto have been a man of strong individuality, and to have made a lasting\r\nimpression on his friends. He died in September, 1875.)]:\r\n\r\n\"I send... revised proofs of an article which will be published in the\r\nJuly number of the 'North American Review,' sending it in the hope that\r\nit will interest or even be of greater value to you. Mr. Mivart's book\r\n['Genesis of Species'] of which this article is substantially a\r\nreview, seems to me a very good background from which to present the\r\nconsiderations which I have endeavoured to set forth in the article, in\r\ndefence and illustration of the theory of Natural Selection. My special\r\npurpose has been to contribute to the theory by placing it in its proper\r\nrelations to philosophical enquiries in general.\" ('Letters of Chauncey\r\nWright,' by J.B. Thayer. Privately printed, 1878, page 230.)\r\n\r\nWith regard to the proofs received from Mr. Wright, my father wrote to\r\nMr. Wallace:]\r\n\r\n\r\nDown, July 9 [1871].\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI send by this post a review by Chauncey Wright, as I much want your\r\nopinion of it as soon as you can send it. I consider you an incomparably\r\nbetter critic than I am. The article, though not very clearly written,\r\nand poor in parts from want of knowledge, seems to me admirable.\r\nMivart's book is producing a great effect against Natural Selection,\r\nand more especially against me. Therefore if you think the article\r\neven somewhat good I will write and get permission to publish it as a\r\nshilling pamphlet, together with the MS. additions (enclosed), for which\r\nthere was not room at the end of the review...\r\n\r\nI am now at work at a new and cheap edition of the 'Origin,' and shall\r\nanswer several points in Mivart's book, and introduce a new chapter for\r\nthis purpose; but I treat the subject so much more concretely, and I\r\ndare say less philosophically, than Wright, that we shall not interfere\r\nwith each other. You will think me a bigot when I say, after studying\r\nMivart, I was never before in my life so convinced of the GENERAL (i.e.\r\nnot in detail) truth of the views in the 'Origin.' I grieve to see the\r\nomission of the words by Mivart, detected by Wright. ('North American\r\nReview,' volume 113, pages 83, 84. Chauncey Wright points out that the\r\nwords omitted are \"essential to the point on which he [Mr. Mivart] cites\r\nMr. Darwin's authority.\" It should be mentioned that the passage from\r\nwhich words are omitted is not given within inverted commas by Mr.\r\nMivart.) I complained to Mivart that in two cases he quotes only the\r\ncommencement of sentences by me, and thus modifies my meaning; but I\r\nnever supposed he would have omitted words. There are other cases of\r\nwhat I consider unfair treatment. I conclude with sorrow that though he\r\nmeans to be honourable he is so bigoted that he cannot act fairly...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO CHAUNCEY WRIGHT. Down, July 14, 1871.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have hardly ever in my life read an article which has given me so much\r\nsatisfaction as the review which you have been so kind as to send me.\r\nI agree to almost everything which you say. Your memory must be\r\nwonderfully accurate, for you know my works as well as I do myself,\r\nand your power of grasping other men's thoughts is something quite\r\nsurprising; and this, as far as my experience goes, is a very rare\r\nquality. As I read on I perceived how you have acquired this power, viz.\r\nby thoroughly analyzing each word.\r\n\r\n... Now I am going to beg a favour. Will you provisionally give me\r\npermission to reprint your article as a shilling pamphlet? I ask only\r\nprovisionally, as I have not yet had time to reflect on the subject. It\r\nwould cost me, I fancy, with advertisements, some 20 or 30 pounds; but\r\nthe worst is that, as I hear, pamphlets never will sell. And this makes\r\nme doubtful. Should you think it too much trouble to send me a title FOR\r\nTHE CHANCE? The title ought, I think, to have Mr. Mivart's name on it.\r\n\r\n... If you grant permission and send a title, you will kindly understand\r\nthat I will first make further enquiries whether there is any chance of\r\na pamphlet being read.\r\n\r\nPray believe me yours very sincerely obliged, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The pamphlet was published in the autumn, and on October 23 my father\r\nwrote to Mr. Wright:--\r\n\r\n\"It pleases me much that you are satisfied with the appearance of your\r\npamphlet. I am sure it will do our cause good service; and this same\r\nopinion Huxley has expressed to me. ('Letters of Chauncey Wright,' page\r\n235.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, July 12 [1871].\r\n\r\n... I feel very doubtful how far I shall succeed in answering Mivart, it\r\nis so difficult to answer objections to doubtful points, and make the\r\ndiscussion readable. I shall make only a selection. The worst of it\r\nis, that I cannot possibly hunt through all my references for isolated\r\npoints, it would take me three weeks of intolerably hard work. I wish I\r\nhad your power of arguing clearly. At present I feel sick of everything,\r\nand if I could occupy my time and forget my daily discomforts, or rather\r\nmiseries, I would never publish another word. But I shall cheer up, I\r\ndare say, soon, having only just got over a bad attack. Farewell;\r\nGod knows why I bother you about myself. I can say nothing more about\r\nmissing-links than what I have said. I should rely much on pre-silurian\r\ntimes; but then comes Sir W. Thomson like an odious spectre. Farewell.\r\n\r\n... There is a most cutting review of me in the 'Quarterly' (July 1871.);\r\nI have only read a few pages. The skill and style make me think of\r\nMivart. I shall soon be viewed as the most despicable of men. This\r\n'Quarterly Review' tempts me to republish Ch. Wright, even if not read\r\nby any one, just to show some one will say a word against Mivart, and\r\nthat his (i.e. Mivart's) remarks ought not to be swallowed without some\r\nreflection... God knows whether my strength and spirit will last out to\r\nwrite a chapter versus Mivart and others; I do so hate controversy and\r\nfeel I shall do it so badly.\r\n\r\n[The above-mentioned 'Quarterly' review was the subject of an article\r\nby Mr. Huxley in the November number of the 'Contemporary Review.' Here,\r\nalso, are discussed Mr. Wallace's 'Contribution to the Theory of Natural\r\nSelection,' and the second edition of Mr. Mivart's 'Genesis of Species.'\r\nWhat follows is taken from Mr. Huxley's article. The 'Quarterly'\r\nreviewer, though being to some extent an evolutionist, believes that Man\r\n\"differs more from an elephant or a gorilla, than do these from the dust\r\nof the earth on which they tread.\" The reviewer also declares that my\r\nfather has \"with needless opposition, set at naught the first principles\r\nof both philosophy and religion.\" Mr. Huxley passes from the 'Quarterly'\r\nreviewer's further statement, that there is no necessary opposition\r\nbetween evolution and religion, to the more definite position taken by\r\nMr. Mivart, that the orthodox authorities of the Roman Catholic Church\r\nagree in distinctly asserting derivative creation, so that \"their\r\nteachings harmonise with all that modern science can possibly require.\"\r\nHere Mr. Huxley felt the want of that \"study of Christian philosophy\"\r\n(at any rate, in its Jesuitic garb), which Mr. Mivart speaks of, and it\r\nwas a want he at once set to work to fill up. He was then staying at St.\r\nAndrews, whence he wrote to my father:--\r\n\r\n\"By great good luck there is an excellent library here, with a good copy\r\nof Suarez (The learned Jesuit on whom Mr. Mivart mainly relies.), in a\r\ndozen big folios. Among these I dived, to the great astonishment of the\r\nlibrarian, and looking into them 'as the careful robin eyes the delver's\r\ntoil' (vide 'Idylls'), I carried off the two venerable clasped volumes\r\nwhich were most promising.\" Even those who know Mr. Huxley's unrivalled\r\npower of tearing the heart out of a book must marvel at the skill with\r\nwhich he has made Suarez speak on his side. \"So I have come out,\" he\r\nwrote, \"in the new character of a defender of Catholic orthodoxy, and\r\nupset Mivart out of the mouth of his own prophet.\"\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Mr. Huxley's critique is largely occupied with a\r\ndissection of the 'Quarterly' reviewer's psychology, and his ethical\r\nviews. He deals, too, with Mr. Wallace's objections to the doctrine of\r\nEvolution by natural causes when applied to the mental faculties of Man.\r\nFinally, he devotes a couple of pages to justifying his description of\r\nthe 'Quarterly' reviewer's \"treatment of Mr. Darwin as alike unjust and\r\nunbecoming.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the two following letters were written before the\r\npublication of Mr. Huxley's article.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, September 21 [1871].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nYour letter has pleased me in many ways, to a wonderful degree... What\r\na wonderful man you are to grapple with those old metaphysico-divinity\r\nbooks. It quite delights me that you are going to some extent to answer\r\nand attack Mivart. His book, as you say, has produced a great effect;\r\nyesterday I perceived the reverberations from it, even from Italy. It\r\nwas this that made me ask Chauncey Wright to publish at my expense his\r\narticle, which seems to me very clever, though ill-written. He has not\r\nknowledge enough to grapple with Mivart in detail. I think there can\r\nbe no shadow of doubt that he is the author of the article in the\r\n'Quarterly Review'... I am preparing a new edition of the 'Origin,' and\r\nshall introduce a new chapter in answer to miscellaneous objections, and\r\nshall give up the greater part to answer Mivart's cases of difficulty of\r\nincipient structures being of no use: and I find it can be done easily.\r\nHe never states his case fairly, and makes wonderful blunders... The\r\npendulum is now swinging against our side, but I feel positive it will\r\nsoon swing the other way; and no mortal man will do half as much as you\r\nin giving it a start in the right direction, as you did at the first\r\ncommencement. God forgive me for writing so long and egotistical a\r\nletter; but it is your fault, for you have so delighted me; I never\r\ndreamed that you would have time to say a word in defence of the cause\r\nwhich you have so often defended. It will be a long battle, after we are\r\ndead and gone... Great is the power of misrepresentation...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Down, September 30 [1871].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nIt was very good of you to send the proof-sheets, for I was VERY anxious\r\nto read your article. I have been delighted with it. How you do smash\r\nMivart's theology: it is almost equal to your article versus Comte\r\n('Fortnightly Review,' 1869. With regard to the relations of Positivism\r\nto Science my father wrote to Mr. Spencer in 1875: \"How curious and\r\namusing it is to see to what an extent the Positivists hate all men of\r\nscience; I fancy they are dimly conscious what laughable and\r\ngigantic blunders their prophet made in predicting the course\r\nof science.\"),--that never can be transcended... But I have been\r\npreeminently glad to read your discussion on [the 'Quarterly'\r\nreviewer's] metaphysics, especially about reason and his definition of\r\nit. I felt sure he was wrong, but having only common observation and\r\nsense to trust to, I did not know what to say in my second edition of\r\nmy 'Descent.' Now a footnote and reference to you will do the work... For\r\nme, this is one of the most IMPORTANT parts of the review. But for\r\nPLEASURE, I have been particularly glad that my few words ('Descent of\r\nMan,' volume i. page 87. A discussion on the question whether an\r\nact done impulsively or instinctively can be called moral.) on the\r\ndistinction, if it can be so called, between Mivart's two forms of\r\nmorality, caught your attention. I am so pleased that you take the same\r\nview, and give authorities for it; but I searched Mill in vain on this\r\nhead. How well you argue the whole case. I am mounting climax on climax;\r\nfor after all there is nothing, I think, better in your whole review\r\nthan your arguments v. Wallace on the intellect of savages. I must tell\r\nyou what Hooker said to me a few years ago. \"When I read Huxley, I feel\r\nquite infantile in intellect.\" By Jove I have felt the truth of this\r\nthroughout your review. What a man you are. There are scores of splendid\r\npassages, and vivid flashes of wit. I have been a good deal more than\r\nmerely pleased by the concluding part of your review; and all the more,\r\nas I own I felt mortified by the accusation of bigotry, arrogance, etc.,\r\nin the 'Quarterly Review.' But I assure you, he may write his worst, and\r\nhe will never mortify me again.\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley, yours gratefully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO F. MULLER. Haredene, Albury, August 2 [1871].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour last letter has interested me greatly; it is wonderfully rich in\r\nfacts and original thoughts. First, let me say that I have been much\r\npleased by what you say about my book. It has had a VERY LARGE sale; but\r\nI have been much abused for it, especially for the chapter on the moral\r\nsense; and most of my reviewers consider the book as a poor affair. God\r\nknows what its merits may really be; all that I know is that I did my\r\nbest. With familiarity I think naturalists will accept sexual selection\r\nto a greater extent than they now seem inclined to do. I should very\r\nmuch like to publish your letter, but I do not see how it could be\r\nmade intelligible, without numerous coloured illustrations, but I will\r\nconsult Mr. Wallace on this head. I earnestly hope that you keep notes\r\nof all your letters, and that some day you will publish a book: 'Notes\r\nof a Naturalist in S. Brazil,' or some such title. Wallace will hardly\r\nadmit the possibility of sexual selection with Lepidoptera, and no doubt\r\nit is very improbable. Therefore, I am very glad to hear of your cases\r\n(which I will quote in the next edition) of the two sets of Hesperiadae,\r\nwhich display their wings differently, according to which surface\r\nis coloured. I cannot believe that such display is accidental and\r\npurposeless...\r\n\r\nNo fact of your letter has interested me more than that about mimicry.\r\nIt is a capital fact about the males pursuing the wrong females. You put\r\nthe difficulty of the first steps in imitation in a most striking and\r\nCONVINCING manner. Your idea of sexual selection having aided protective\r\nimitation interests me greatly, for the same idea had occurred to me in\r\nquite different cases, viz. the dulness of all animals in the Galapagos\r\nIslands, Patagonia, etc., and in some other cases; but I was afraid\r\neven to hint at such an idea. Would you object to my giving some such\r\nsentence as follows: \"F. Muller suspects that sexual selection may\r\nhave come into play, in aid of protective imitation, in a very peculiar\r\nmanner, which will appear extremely improbable to those who do not fully\r\nbelieve in sexual selection. It is that the appreciation of certain\r\ncolour is developed in those species which frequently behold other\r\nspecies thus ornamented.\" Again let me thank you cordially for your most\r\ninteresting letter...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO E.B. TYLOR. Down, [September 24, 1871].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI hope that you will allow me to have the pleasure of telling you how\r\ngreatly I have been interested by your 'Primitive Culture,' now that\r\nI have finished it. It seems to me a most profound work, which will\r\nbe certain to have permanent value, and to be referred to for years to\r\ncome. It is wonderful how you trace animism from the lower races up\r\nto the religious belief of the highest races. It will make me for the\r\nfuture look at religion--a belief in the soul, etc.--from a new point\r\nof view. How curious, also, are the survivals or rudiments of old\r\ncustoms... You will perhaps be surprised at my writing at so late\r\na period, but I have had the book read aloud to me, and from much\r\nill-health of late could only stand occasional short reads. The\r\nundertaking must have cost you gigantic labour. Nevertheless, I\r\nearnestly hope that you may be induced to treat morals in the same\r\nenlarged yet careful manner, as you have animism. I fancy from the last\r\nchapter that you have thought of this. No man could do the work so well\r\nas you, and the subject assuredly is a most important and interesting\r\none. You must now possess references which would guide you to a sound\r\nestimation of the morals of savages; and how writers like Wallace,\r\nLubbock, etc., etc., do differ on this head. Forgive me for troubling\r\nyou, and believe me, with much respect,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1872.\r\n\r\n[At the beginning of the year the sixth edition of the 'Origin,' which\r\nhad been begun in June, 1871, was nearly completed. The last sheet was\r\nrevised on January 10, 1872, and the book was published in the course of\r\nthe month. This volume differs from the previous ones in appearance and\r\nsize--it consists of 458 pages instead of 596 pages and is a few ounces\r\nlighter; it is printed on bad paper, in small type, and with the\r\nlines unpleasantly close together. It had, however, one advantage over\r\nprevious editions, namely that it was issued at a lower price. It is\r\nto be regretted that this the final edition of the 'Origin' should have\r\nappeared in so unattractive a form; a form which has doubtless kept off\r\nmany readers from the book.\r\n\r\nThe discussion suggested by the 'Genesis of Species' was perhaps the\r\nmost important addition to the book. The objection that incipient\r\nstructures cannot be of use was dealt with in some detail, because it\r\nseemed to the author that this was the point in Mr. Mivart's book which\r\nhas struck most readers in England.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking proof of how wide and general had become the acceptance\r\nof his views that my father found it necessary to insert (sixth edition,\r\npage 424), the sentence: \"As a record of a former state of things, I\r\nhave retained in the foregoing paragraphs and also elsewhere, several\r\nsentences which imply that naturalists believe in the separate creation\r\nof each species; and I have been much censured for having thus expressed\r\nmyself. But undoubtedly this was the general belief when the first\r\nedition of the present work appeared... Now things are wholly changed,\r\nand almost every naturalist admits the great principle of evolution.\"\r\n\r\nA small correction introduced into this sixth edition is connected with\r\none of his minor papers: \"Note on the habits of the Pampas Woodpecker.\"\r\n(Zoolog. Soc. Proc. 1870.) In the fifth edition of the 'Origin,' page\r\n220, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"Yet as I can assert not only from my own observation, but from that of\r\nthe accurate Azara, it [the ground woodpecker] never climbs a tree.\" The\r\npaper in question was a reply to Mr. Hudson's remarks on the woodpecker\r\nin a previous number of the same journal. The last sentence of my\r\nfather's paper is worth quoting for its temperate tone: \"Finally, I\r\ntrust that Mr. Hudson is mistaken when he says that any one acquainted\r\nwith the habits of this bird might be induced to believe that I 'had\r\npurposely wrested the truth' in order to prove my theory. He exonerates\r\nme from this charge; but I should be loath to think that there are many\r\nnaturalists who, without any evidence, would accuse a fellow-worker\r\nof telling a deliberate falsehood to prove his theory.\" In the sixth\r\nedition, page 142, the passage runs \"in certain large districts it does\r\nnot climb trees.\" And he goes on to give Mr. Hudson's statement that in\r\nother regions it does frequent trees.\r\n\r\nOne of the additions in the sixth edition (page 149), was a reference\r\nto Mr. A. Hyatt's and Professor Cope's theory of \"acceleration.\" With\r\nregard to this he wrote (October 10, 1872) in characteristic words to\r\nMr. Hyatt:--\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to take this opportunity to express my sincere regret at\r\nhaving committed two grave errors in the last edition of my 'Origin\r\nof Species,' in my allusion to yours and Professor Cope's views\r\non acceleration and retardation of development. I had thought that\r\nProfessor Cope had preceded you; but I now well remember having formerly\r\nread with lively interest, and marked, a paper by you somewhere in my\r\nlibrary, on fossil Cephalapods with remarks on the subject. It seems\r\nalso that I have quite misrepresented your joint view. This has vexed me\r\nmuch. I confess that I have never been able to grasp fully what you wish\r\nto show, and I presume that this must be owing to some dulness on my\r\npart.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, it may be mentioned that this cheap edition being to some extent\r\nintended as a popular one, was made to include a glossary of technical\r\nterms, \"given because several readers have complained... that some of the\r\nterms used were unintelligible to them.\" The glossary was compiled by\r\nMr. Dallas, and being an excellent collection of clear and sufficient\r\ndefinitions, must have proved useful to many readers.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.L.A. DE QUATREFAGES. Down, January 15, 1872.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your very kind letter and exertions in my favour.\r\nI had thought that the publication of my last book ['Descent of Man']\r\nwould have destroyed all your sympathy with me, but though I estimated\r\nvery highly your great liberality of mind, it seems that I underrated\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI am gratified to hear that M. Lacaze-Duthiers will vote (He was not\r\nelected as a corresponding member of the French Academy until 1878.) for\r\nme, for I have long honoured his name. I cannot help regretting that you\r\nshould expend your valuable time in trying to obtain for me the honour\r\nof election, for I fear, judging from the last time, that all your\r\nlabour will be in vain. Whatever the result may be, I shall always\r\nretain the most lively recollection of your sympathy and kindness, and\r\nthis will quite console me for my rejection.\r\n\r\nWith much respect and esteem, I remain, dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours truly obliged, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--With respect to the great stress which you lay on man walking on\r\ntwo legs, whilst the quadrumana go on all fours, permit me to remind you\r\nthat no one much values the great difference in the mode of locomotion,\r\nand consequently in structure, between seals and the terrestrial\r\ncarnivora, or between the almost biped kangaroos and other marsupials.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO AUGUST WEISMANN. (Professor of Zoology in Freiburg.)\r\nDown, April 5, 1872.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have now read your essay ('Ueber den Einfluss der Isolirung auf die\r\nArtbildung.' Leipzig, 1872.) with very great interest. Your view of the\r\n'Origin' of local races through \"Amixie,\" is altogether new to me,\r\nand seems to throw an important light on an obscure problem. There\r\nis, however, something strange about the periods or endurance of\r\nvariability. I formerly endeavoured to investigate the subject, not\r\nby looking to past time, but to species of the same genus widely\r\ndistributed; and I found in many cases that all the species, with\r\nperhaps one or two exceptions, were variable. It would be a very\r\ninteresting subject for a conchologist to investigate, viz., whether\r\nthe species of the same genus were variable during many successive\r\ngeological formations. I began to make enquiries on this head, but\r\nfailed in this, as in so many other things, from the want of time and\r\nstrength. In your remarks on crossing, you do not, as it seems to\r\nme, lay nearly stress enough on the increased vigour of the offspring\r\nderived from parents which have been exposed to different conditions. I\r\nhave during the last five years been making experiments on this subject\r\nwith plants, and have been astonished at the results, which have not yet\r\nbeen published.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of your essay, I thought that you wasted (to use an\r\nEnglish expression) too much powder and shot on M. Wagner (Prof. Wagner\r\nhas written two essays on the same subject. 'Die Darwin'sche Theorie\r\nund das Migrationsgesetz, in 1868, and 'Ueber den Einfluss der\r\nGeographischen Isolirung, etc.,' an address to the Bavarian Academy\r\nof Sciences at Munich, 1870.); but I changed my opinion when I saw how\r\nadmirably you treated the whole case, and how well you used the\r\nfacts about the Planorbis. I wish I had studied this latter case more\r\ncarefully. The manner in which, as you show, the different varieties\r\nblend together and make a constant whole, agrees perfectly with my\r\nhypothetical illustrations.\r\n\r\nMany years ago the late E. Forbes described three closely consecutive\r\nbeds in a secondary formation, each with representative forms of the\r\nsame fres-water shells: the case is evidently analogous with that\r\nof Hilgendorf (\"Ueber Planorbis multiformis im Steinheimer\r\nSusswasser-kalk.\" Monatsbericht of the Berlin Academy, 1866.), but the\r\ninteresting connecting varieties or links were here absent. I rejoice\r\nto think that I formerly said as emphatically as I could, that neither\r\nisolation nor time by themselves do anything for the modification\r\nof species. Hardly anything in your essay has pleased me so much\r\npersonally, as to find that you believe to a certain extent in sexual\r\nselection. As far as I can judge, very few naturalists believe in this.\r\nI may have erred on many points, and extended the doctrine too far,\r\nbut I feel a strong conviction that sexual selection will hereafter be\r\nadmitted to be a powerful agency. I cannot agree with what you say about\r\nthe taste for beauty in animals not easily varying. It may be suspected\r\nthat even the habit of viewing differently coloured surrounding objects\r\nwould influence their taste, and Fritz Muller even goes so far as to\r\nbelieve that the sight of gaudy butterflies might influence the taste\r\nof distinct species. There are many remarks and statements in your essay\r\nwhich have interested me greatly, and I thank you for the pleasure which\r\nI have received from reading it.\r\n\r\nWith sincere respect, I remain, My dear Sir, yours very faithfully,\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--If you should ever be induced to consider the whole doctrine of\r\nsexual selection, I think that you will be led to the conclusion, that\r\ncharacters thus gained by one sex are very commonly transferred in a\r\ngreater or less degree to the other sex.\r\n\r\n\r\n[With regard to Moritz Wagner's first Essay, my father wrote to that\r\nnaturalist, apparently in 1868:]\r\n\r\nDear and respected Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for sending me your 'Migrationsgesetz, etc.,' and\r\nfor the very kind and most honourable notice which you have taken of my\r\nworks. That a naturalist who has travelled into so many and such distant\r\nregions, and who has studied animals of so many classes, should, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, agree with me, is, I can assure you, the highest\r\ngratification of which I am capable... Although I saw the effects of\r\nisolation in the case of islands and mountain-ranges, and knew of a few\r\ninstances of rivers, yet the greater number of your facts were quite\r\nunknown to me. I now see that from the want of knowledge I did not make\r\nnearly sufficient use of the views which you advocate; and I almost wish\r\nI could believe in its importance to the same extent with you; for you\r\nwell show, in a manner which never occurred to me, that it removes many\r\ndifficulties and objections. But I must still believe that in many large\r\nareas all the individuals of the same species have been slowly modified,\r\nin the same manner, for instance, as the English race-horse has\r\nbeen improved, that is by the continued selection of the fleetest\r\nindividuals, without any separation. But I admit that by this process\r\ntwo or more new species could hardly be found within the same limited\r\narea; some degree of separation, if not indispensable, would be highly\r\nadvantageous; and here your facts and views will be of great value...\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter bears on the same subject. It refers to Professor\r\nM. Wagner's Essay, published in \"Das Ausland\", May 31, 1875:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MORITZ WAGNER. Down, October 13, 1876.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have now finished reading your essays, which have interested me in a\r\nvery high degree, notwithstanding that I differ much from you on various\r\npoints. For instance, several considerations make me doubt whether\r\nspecies are much more variable at one period than at another, except\r\nthrough the agency of changed conditions. I wish, however, that I\r\ncould believe in this doctrine, as it removes many difficulties. But\r\nmy strongest objection to your theory is that it does not explain the\r\nmanifold adaptations in structure in every organic being--for instance\r\nin a Picus for climbing trees and catching insects--or in a Strix for\r\ncatching animals at night, and so on ad infinitum. No theory is in the\r\nleast satisfactory to me unless it clearly explains such adaptations. I\r\nthink that you misunderstand my views on isolation. I believe that all\r\nthe individuals of a species can be slowly modified within the same\r\ndistrict, in nearly the same manner as man effects by what I have called\r\nthe process of unconscious selection... I do not believe that one species\r\nwill give birth to two or more new species as long as they are mingled\r\ntogether within the same district. Nevertheless I cannot doubt that many\r\nnew species have been simultaneously developed within the same large\r\ncontinental area; and in my 'Origin of Species' I endeavoured to\r\nexplain how two new species might be developed, although they met and\r\nintermingled on the BORDERS of their range. It would have been a strange\r\nfact if I had overlooked the importance of isolation, seeing that it was\r\nsuch cases as that of the Galapagos Archipelago, which chiefly led me\r\nto study the origin of species. In my opinion the greatest error which\r\nI have committed, has been not allowing sufficient weight to the direct\r\naction of the environment, i.e. food, climate, etc., independently\r\nof natural selection. Modifications thus caused, which are neither of\r\nadvantage nor disadvantage to the modified organism, would be especially\r\nfavoured, as I can now see chiefly through your observations, by\r\nisolation in a small area, where only a few individuals lived under\r\nnearly uniform conditions.\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote the 'Origin,' and for some years afterwards, I could find\r\nlittle good evidence of the direct action of the environment; now there\r\nis a large body of evidence, and your case of the Saturnia is one of the\r\nmost remarkable of which I have heard. Although we differ so greatly,\r\nI hope that you will permit me to express my respect for your\r\nlong-continued and successful labours in the good cause of natural\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nI remain, dear Sir, yours very faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The two following letters are also of interest as bearing on my\r\nfather's views on the action of isolation as regards the origin of new\r\nspecies:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO K. SEMPER. Down, November 26, 1878.\r\n\r\nMy dear Professor Semper,\r\n\r\nWhen I published the sixth edition of the 'Origin,' I thought a\r\ngood deal on the subject to which you refer, and the opinion therein\r\nexpressed was my deliberate conviction. I went as far as I could,\r\nperhaps too far in agreement with Wagner; since that time I have seen no\r\nreason to change my mind, but then I must add that my attention has been\r\nabsorbed on other subjects. There are two different classes of cases, as\r\nit appears to me, viz. those in which a species becomes slowly modified\r\nin the same country (of which I cannot doubt there are innumerable\r\ninstances) and those cases in which a species splits into two or three\r\nor more new species, and in the latter case, I should think nearly\r\nperfect separation would greatly aid in their \"specification,\" to coin a\r\nnew word.\r\n\r\nI am very glad that you are taking up this subject, for you will be sure\r\nto throw much light on it. I remember well, long ago, oscillating much;\r\nwhen I thought of the Fauna and Flora of the Galapagos Islands I was all\r\nfor isolation, when I thought of S. America I doubted much. Pray believe\r\nme,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I hope that this letter will not be quite illegible, but I have no\r\namanuensis at present.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO K. SEMPER. Down, November 30, 1878.\r\n\r\nDear Professor Semper,\r\n\r\nSince writing I have recalled some of the thoughts and conclusions which\r\nhave passed through my mind of late years. In North America, in going\r\nfrom north to south or from east to west, it is clear that the changed\r\nconditions of life have modified the organisms in the different regions,\r\nso that they now form distinct races or even species. It is further\r\nclear that in isolated districts, however small, the inhabitants almost\r\nalways get slightly modified, and how far this is due to the nature of\r\nthe slightly different conditions to which they are exposed, and how far\r\nto mere interbreeding, in the manner explained by Weismann, I can\r\nform no opinion. The same difficulty occurred to me (as shown in my\r\n'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication') with respect to\r\nthe aboriginal breeds of cattle, sheep, etc., in the separated districts\r\nof Great Britain, and indeed throughout Europe. As our knowledge\r\nadvances, very slight differences, considered by systematists as of\r\nno importance in structure, are continually found to be functionally\r\nimportant; and I have been especially struck with this fact in the case\r\nof plants to which my observations have of late years been confined.\r\nTherefore it seems to me rather rash to consider the slight differences\r\nbetween representative species, for instance those inhabiting the\r\ndifferent islands of the same archipelago, as of no functional\r\nimportance, and as not in any way due to natural selection. With respect\r\nto all adapted structures, and these are innumerable, I cannot see\r\nhow M. Wagner's view throws any light, nor indeed do I see at all more\r\nclearly than I did before, from the numerous cases which he has brought\r\nforward, how and why it is that a long isolated form should almost\r\nalways become slightly modified. I do not know whether you will care\r\nabout hearing my further opinion on the point in question, for as before\r\nremarked I have not attended much of late years to such questions,\r\nthinking it prudent, now that I am growing old, to work at easier\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI hope and trust that you will throw light on these points.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I will add another remark which I remember occurred to me when I\r\nfirst read M. Wagner. When a species first arrives on a small island,\r\nit will probably increase rapidly, and unless all the individuals change\r\ninstantaneously (which is improbable in the highest degree), the slowly,\r\nmore or less, modifying offspring must intercross one with another, and\r\nwith their unmodified parents, and any offspring not as yet modified.\r\nThe case will then be like that of domesticated animals which have\r\nslowly become modified, either by the action of the external conditions\r\nor by the process which I have called the UNCONSCIOUS SELECTION by\r\nman--i.e., in contrast with methodical selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The letters continue the history of the year 1872, which has been\r\ninterrupted by a digression on Isolation.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO THE MARQUIS DE SAPORTA. Down, April 8, 1872.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you very sincerely and feel much honoured by the trouble which\r\nyou have taken in giving me your reflections on the origin of Man. It\r\ngratifies me extremely that some parts of my work have interested you,\r\nand that we agree on the main conclusion of the derivation of man from\r\nsome lower form.\r\n\r\nI will reflect on what you have said, but I cannot at present give up my\r\nbelief in the close relationship of Man to the higher Simiae. I do not\r\nput much trust in any single character, even that of dentition; but\r\nI put the greatest faith in resemblances in many parts of the whole\r\norganisation, for I cannot believe that such resemblances can be due to\r\nany cause except close blood relationship. That man is closely allied to\r\nthe higher Simiae is shown by the classification of Linnaeus, who was\r\nso good a judge of affinity. The man who in England knows most about the\r\nstructure of the Simiae, namely, Mr. Mivart, and who is bitterly opposed\r\nto my doctrines about the derivation of the mental powers, yet has\r\npublicly admitted that I have not put man too close to the higher\r\nSimiae, as far as bodily structure is concerned. I do not think the\r\nabsence of reversions of structure in man is of much weight; C. Vogt,\r\nindeed, argues that [the existence of] Micr-cephalous idiots is a case\r\nof reversion. No one who believes in Evolution will doubt that the\r\nPhocae are descended from some terrestrial Carnivore. Yet no one would\r\nexpect to meet with any such reversion in them. The lesser divergence of\r\ncharacter in the races of man in comparison with the species of Simiadae\r\nmay perhaps be accounted for by man having spread over the world at a\r\nmuch later period than did the Simiadae. I am fully prepared to\r\nadmit the high antiquity of man; but then we have evidence, in the\r\nDryopithecus, of the high antiquity of the Anthropomorphous Simiae.\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that you are at work on your fossil plants, which of\r\nlate years have afforded so rich a field for discovery. With my best\r\nthanks for your great kindness, and with much respect, I remain,\r\n\r\nDear Sir, yours very faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In April, 1872, he was elected to the Royal Society of Holland, and\r\nwrote to Professor Donders:--\r\n\r\n\"Very many thanks for your letter. The honour of being elected a foreign\r\nmember of your Royal Society has pleased me much. The sympathy of his\r\nfellow workers has always appeared to me by far the highest reward\r\nto which any scientific man can look. My gratification has been not a\r\nlittle increased by first hearing of the honour from you.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO CHAUNCEY WRIGHT. Down, June 3, 1872.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your article (The proof-sheets of an article which\r\nappeared in the July number of the 'North American Review.' It was a\r\nrejoinder to Mr. Mivart's reply ('North American Review,' April 1872) to\r\nMr. Chauncey Wright's pamphlet. Chauncey Wright says of it ('Letters,'\r\npage 238):--\"It is not properly a rejoinder but a new article, repeating\r\nand expounding some of the points of my pamphlet, and answering some\r\nof Mr. Mivart's replies incidentally.\") in the 'North American Review,'\r\nwhich I have read with great interest. Nothing can be clearer than the\r\nway in which you discuss the permanence or fixity of species. It never\r\noccurred to me to suppose that any one looked at the case as it seems\r\nMr. Mivart does. Had I read his answer to you, perhaps I should have\r\nperceived this; but I have resolved to waste no more time in reading\r\nreviews of my works or on Evolution, excepting when I hear that they\r\nare good and contain new matter... It is pretty clear that Mr. Mivart has\r\ncome to the end of his tether on this subject.\r\n\r\nAs your mind is so clear, and as you consider so carefully the meaning\r\nof words, I wish you would take some incidental occasion to consider\r\nwhen a thing may properly be said to be effected by the will of man.\r\nI have been led to the wish by reading an article by your Professor\r\nWhitney versus Schleicher. He argues, because each step of change in\r\nlanguage is made by the will of man, the whole language so changes;\r\nbut I do not think that this is so, as man has no intention or wish\r\nto change the language. It is a parallel case with what I have called\r\n\"unconscious selection,\" which depends on men consciously preserving the\r\nbest individuals, and thus unconsciously altering the breed.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, yours sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Not long afterwards (September) Mr. Chauncey Wright paid a visit to\r\nDown (Mr. and Mrs. C.L. Brace, who had given much of their lives to\r\nphilanthropic work in New York, also paid a visit at Down in this\r\nsummer. Some of their work is recorded in Mr. Brace's 'The Dangerous\r\nClasses of New York,' and of this book my father wrote to the author:--\r\n\r\n\"Since you were here my wife has read aloud to me more than half of your\r\nwork, and it has interested us both in the highest degree, and we shall\r\nread every word of the remainder. The facts seem to me very well told,\r\nand the inferences very striking. But after all this is but a weak part\r\nof the impression left on our minds by what we have read; for we are\r\nboth filled with earnest admiration at the heroic labours of yourself\r\nand others.\"), which he described in a letter ('Letters, page 246-248.)\r\nto Miss S. Sedgwick (now Mrs. William Darwin): \"If you can imagine\r\nme enthusiastic--absolutely and unqualifiedly so, without a BUT or\r\ncriticism, then think of my last evening's and this morning's talks with\r\nMr. Darwin... I was never so worked up in my life, and did not sleep many\r\nhours under the hospitable roof... It would be quite impossible to give\r\nby way of report any idea of these talks before and at and after dinner,\r\nat breakfast, and at leav-taking; and yet I dislike the egotism of\r\n'testifying' like other religious enthusiasts, without any verification,\r\nor hint of similar experience.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO HERBERT SPENCER. Bassett, Southampton, June 10,\r\n[1872].\r\n\r\nDear Spencer,\r\n\r\nI dare say you will think me a foolish fellow, but I cannot resist the\r\nwish to express my unbounded admiration of your article ('Mr. Martineau\r\non Evolution,' by Herbert Spencer, 'Contemporary Review,' July 1872.)\r\nin answer to Mr. Martineau. It is, indeed, admirable, and hardly less\r\nso your second article on Sociology (which, however, I have not yet\r\nfinished): I never believed in the reigning influence of great men on\r\nthe world's progress; but if asked why I did not believe, I should have\r\nbeen sorely perplexed to have given a good answer. Every one with eyes\r\nto see and ears to hear (the number, I fear, are not many) ought to bow\r\ntheir knee to you, and I for one do.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours most sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, July 12 [1872].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI must exhale and express my joy at the way in which the newspapers have\r\ntaken up your case. I have seen the \"Times\", the \"Daily News\", and the\r\n\"Pall Mall\", and hear that others have taken up the case.\r\n\r\nThe Memorial has done great good this way, whatever may be the result in\r\nthe action of our wretched Government. On my soul, it is enough to make\r\none turn into an old honest Tory...\r\n\r\nIf you answer this, I shall be sorry that I have relieved my feelings by\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The memorial here referred to was addressed to Mr. Gladstone, and was\r\nsigned by a number of distinguished men, including Sir Charles Lyell,\r\nMr. Bentham, Mr. Huxley, and Sir James Paget.

The document is published in full in 'Nature' (July 11, 1872),\r\nand is well worth studying as an example of the treatment which it is\r\npossible for science to receive from officialism. As 'Nature' observes,\r\nit is a paper which must be read with the greatest indignation by\r\nscientific men in every part of the world, and with shame by all\r\nEnglishmen. The signatories of the memorial conclude by protesting\r\nagainst the expected consequences of Sir Joseph Hooker's\r\npersecution--namely his resignation, and the loss of \"a man honoured for\r\nhis integrity, beloved for his courtesy and kindliness of heart; and who\r\nhas spent in the public service not only a stainless but an illustrious\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nHappily this misfortune was averted, and Sir Joseph was freed from\r\nfurther molestation.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, August 3 [1872].\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI hate controversy, chiefly perhaps because I do it badly; but as\r\nDr. Bree accuses you (Mr. Wallace had reviewed Dr. Bree's book, 'An\r\nExposition of Fallacies in the Hypothesis of Mr. Darwin,' in 'Nature,'\r\nJuly 25, 1872.) of \"blundering,\" I have thought myself bound to send\r\nthe enclosed letter (The letter is as follows:--\"Bree on Darwinism.\"\r\n'Nature,' August 8, 1872. Permit me to state--though the statement is\r\nalmost superfluous--that Mr. Wallace, in his review of Dr. Bree's work,\r\ngives with perfect correctness what I intended to express, and what I\r\nbelieve was expressed clearly, with respect to the probable position\r\nof man in the early part of his pedigree. As I have not seen Dr. Bree's\r\nrecent work, and as his letter is unintelligible to me, I cannot even\r\nconjecture how he has so completely mistaken my meaning: but, perhaps,\r\nno one who has read Mr. Wallace's article, or who has read a work\r\nformerly published by Dr. Bree on the same subject as his recent\r\none, will be surprised at any amount of misunderstanding on his\r\npart.--Charles Darwin. August 3.) to 'Nature,' that is if you in the\r\nleast desire it. In this case please post it. If you do not AT ALL wish\r\nit, I should rather prefer not sending it, and in this case please to\r\ntear it up. And I beg you to do the same, if you intend answering Dr.\r\nBree yourself, as you will do it incomparably better than I should. Also\r\nplease tear it up if you don't like the letter.\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace, yours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, August 28, 1872.\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI have at last finished the gigantic job of reading Dr. Bastian's book\r\n('The Beginnings of Life.' H.C. Bastian, 1872.) and have been deeply\r\ninterested by it. You wished to hear my impression, but it is not worth\r\nsending.\r\n\r\nHe seems to me an extremely able man, as, indeed, I thought when I read\r\nhis first essay. His general argument in favour of Archebiosis (That is\r\nto say, Spontaneous Generation. For the distinction between Archebiosis\r\nand Heterogenesis, see Bastian, chapter vi.) is wonderfully strong,\r\nthough I cannot think much of some few of his arguments. The result\r\nis that I am bewildered and astonished by his statements, but am\r\nnot convinced, though, on the whole, it seems to me probable that\r\nArchebiosis is true. I am not convinced, partly I think owing to the\r\ndeductive cast of much of his reasoning; and I know not why, but I never\r\nfeel convinced by deduction, even in the case of H. Spencer's writings.\r\nIf Dr. Bastian's book had been turned upside down, and he had begun with\r\nthe various cases of Heterogenesis, and then gone on to organic,\r\nand afterwards to saline solutions, and had then given his general\r\narguments, I should have been, I believe, much more influenced.\r\nI suspect, however, that my chief difficulty is the effect of old\r\nconvictions being stereotyped on my brain. I must have more evidence\r\nthat germs, or the minutest fragments of the lowest forms, are always\r\nkilled by 212 degrees of Fahr. Perhaps the mere reiteration of the\r\nstatements given by Dr. Bastian [by] other men, whose judgment I\r\nrespect, and who have worked long on the lower organisms, would suffice\r\nto convince me. Here is a fine confession of intellectual weakness; but\r\nwhat an inexplicable frame of mind is that of belief!\r\n\r\nAs for Rotifers and Tardigrades being spontaneously generated, my mind\r\ncan no more digest such statements, whether true or false, than my\r\nstomach can digest a lump of lead. Dr. Bastian is always comparing\r\nArchebiosis, as well as growth, to crystallisation; but, on this view,\r\na Rotifer or Tardigrade is adapted to its humble conditions of life by\r\na happy accident, and this I cannot believe... He must have worked with\r\nvery impure materials in some cases, as plenty of organisms appeared in\r\na saline solution not containing an atom of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nI wholly disagree with Dr. Bastian about many points in his latter\r\nchapters. Thus the frequency of generalised forms in the older strata\r\nseems to me clearly to indicate the common descent with divergence of\r\nmore recent forms. Notwithstanding all his sneers, I do not strike\r\nmy colours as yet about Pangenesis. I should like to live to see\r\nArchebiosis proved true, for it would be a discovery of transcendent\r\nimportance; or, if false, I should like to see it disproved, and the\r\nfacts otherwise explained; but I shall not live to see all this. If ever\r\nproved, Dr. Bastian will have taken a prominent part in the work. How\r\ngrand is the onward rush of science; it is enough to console us for the\r\nmany errors which we have committed, and for our efforts being overlaid\r\nand forgotten in the mass of new facts and new views which are daily\r\nturning up.\r\n\r\nThis is all I have to say about Dr. Bastian's book, and it certainly has\r\nnot been worth saying...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A. DE CANDOLLE. Down, December 11, 1872.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI began reading your new book ('Histoire des Sciences et des Savants.'\r\n1873.) sooner than I intended, and when I once began, I could not stop;\r\nand now you must allow me to thank you for the very great pleasure which\r\nit has given me. I have hardly ever read anything more original\r\nand interesting than your treatment of the causes which favour the\r\ndevelopment of scientific men. The whole was quite new to me, and most\r\ncurious. When I began your essay I was afraid that you were going to\r\nattack the principle of inheritance in relation to mind, but I soon\r\nfound myself fully content to follow you and accept your limitations. I\r\nhave felt, of course, special interest in the latter part of your work,\r\nbut there was here less novelty to me. In many parts you do me much\r\nhonour, and everywhere more than justice. Authors generally like to hear\r\nwhat points most strike different readers, so I will mention that of\r\nyour shorter essays, that on the future prevalence of languages, and on\r\nvaccination interested me the most, as, indeed, did that on statistics,\r\nand free will. Great liability to certain diseases, being probably\r\nliable to atavism, is quite a new idea to me. At page 322 you suggest\r\nthat a young swallow ought to be separated, and then let loose in\r\norder to test the power of instinct; but nature annually performs this\r\nexperiment, as old cuckoos migrate in England some weeks before the\r\nyoung birds of the same year. By the way, I have just used the forbidden\r\nword \"nature,\" which, after reading your essay, I almost determined\r\nnever to use again. There are very few remarks in your book to which I\r\ndemur, but when you back up Asa Gray in saying that all instincts are\r\ncongenital habits, I must protest.\r\n\r\nFinally, will you permit me to ask you a question: have you yourself,\r\nor some one who can be quite trusted, observed (page 322) that the\r\nbutterflies on the Alps are tamer than those on the lowlands? Do they\r\nbelong to the same species? Has this fact been observed with more than\r\none species? Are they brightly coloured kinds? I am especially curious\r\nabout their alighting on the brightly coloured parts of ladies'\r\ndresses, more especially because I have been more than once assured\r\nthat butterflies like bright colours, for instance, in India the scarlet\r\nleaves of Poinsettia.\r\n\r\nOnce again allow me to thank you for having sent me your work, and for\r\nthe very unusual amount of pleasure which I have received in reading it.\r\n\r\nWith much respect, I remain, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The last revise of the 'Expression of the Emotions' was finished on\r\nAugust 22nd, 1872, and he wrote in his Diary:--\"Has taken me about\r\ntwelve months.\" As usual he had no belief in the possibility of the book\r\nbeing generally successful. The following passage in a letter to Haeckel\r\ngives the impression that he had felt the writing of this book as a\r\nsomewhat severe strain:--\r\n\r\n\"I have finished my little book on 'Expression,' and when it is\r\npublished in November I will of course send you a copy, in case you\r\nwould like to read it for amusement. I have resumed some old botanical\r\nwork, and perhaps I shall never again attempt to discuss theoretical\r\nviews.\r\n\r\n\"I am growing old and weak, and no man can tell when his intellectual\r\npowers begin to fail. Long life and happiness to you for your own sake\r\nand for that of science.\"\r\n\r\nIt was published in the autumn. The edition consisted of 7000, and\r\nof these 5267 copies were sold at Mr. Murray's sale in November.\r\nTwo thousand were printed at the end of the year, and this proved a\r\nmisfortune, as they did not afterwards sell so rapidly, and thus a mass\r\nof notes collected by the author was never employed for a second edition\r\nduring his lifetime.\r\n\r\nAmong the reviews of the 'Expression of the Emotions' may be mentioned\r\nthe unfavourable notices in the \"Athenaeum\", November 9, 1872, and the\r\n\"Times\", December 13, 1872. A good review by Mr. Wallace appeared in the\r\n'Quarterly Journal of Science,' January 1873. Mr. Wallace truly remarks\r\nthat the book exhibits certain \"characteristics of the author's mind\r\nin an eminent degree,\" namely, \"the insatiable longing to discover the\r\ncauses of the varied and complex phenomena presented by living things.\"\r\nHe adds that in the case of the author \"the restless curiosity of the\r\nchild to know the 'what for?' the 'why?' and the 'how?' of everything\"\r\nseems \"never to have abated its force.\"\r\n\r\nA writer in one of the theological reviews describes the book as the\r\nmost \"powerful and insidious\" of all the author's works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Alexander Bain criticised the book in a postscript to the\r\n'Senses and the Intellect;' to this essay the following letter refers:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ALEXANDER BAIN. Down, October 9, 1873.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am particularly obliged to you for having send me your essay. Your\r\ncriticisms are all written in a quite fair spirit, and indeed no one who\r\nknows you or your works would expect anything else. What you say about\r\nthe vagueness of what I have called the direct action of the nervous\r\nsystem, is perfectly just. I felt it so at the time, and even more\r\nof late. I confess that I have never been able fully to grasp your\r\nprinciple of spontaneity, as well as some other of your points, so as to\r\napply them to special cases. But as we look at everything from\r\ndifferent points of view, it is not likely that we should agree closely.\r\n(Professor Bain expounded his theory of Spontaneity in the essay here\r\nalluded to. It would be impossible to do justice to it within the limits\r\nof a foot-note. The following quotations may give some notion of it:--\r\n\r\n\"By Spontaneity I understand the readiness to pass into movement in the\r\nabsence of all stimulation whatever; the essential requisite being\r\nthat the nerve-centres and muscles shall be fresh and vigorous... The\r\ngesticulations and the carols of young and active animals are mere\r\noverflow of nervous energy; and although they are very apt to concur\r\nwith pleasing emotion, they have an independent source... They are not\r\nproperly movements of expression; they express nothing at all except an\r\nabundant stock of physical power.\")\r\n\r\nI have been greatly pleased by what you say about the crying expression\r\nand about blushing. Did you read a review in a late 'Edinburgh?' (The\r\nreview on the 'Expression of the Emotions' appeared in the April number\r\nof the 'Edinburgh Review,' 1873. The opening sentence is a fair sample\r\nof the general tone of the article: \"Mr. Darwin has added another volume\r\nof amusing stories and grotesque illustrations to the remarkable\r\nseries of works already devoted to the exposition and defence of the\r\nevolutionary hypothesis.\" A few other quotations may be worth giving.\r\n\"His one-sided devotion to an a priori scheme of interpretation seems\r\nthus steadily tending to impair the author's hitherto unrivalled powers\r\nas an observer. However this may be, most impartial critics will, we\r\nthink, admit that there is a marked falling off both in philosophical\r\ntone and scientific interest in the works produced since Mr. Darwin\r\ncommitted himself to the crude metaphysical conception so largely\r\nassociated with his name.\" The article is directed against Evolution\r\nas a whole, almost as much as against the doctrines of the book under\r\ndiscussion. We find throughout plenty of that effective style of\r\ncriticism which consists in the use of such expressions as \"dogmatism,\"\r\n\"intolerance,\" \"presumptuous,\" \"arrogant.\" Together with accusations of\r\nsuch various faults a \"virtual abandonment of the inductive method,\" and\r\nthe use of slang and vulgarisms.\r\n\r\nThe part of the article which seems to have interested my father is\r\nthe discussion on the use which he ought to have made of painting and\r\nsculpture.) It was magnificently contemptuous towards myself and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nI retain a very pleasant recollection of our sojourn together at that\r\ndelightful place, Moor Park.\r\n\r\nWith my renewed thanks, I remain, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MRS. HALIBURTON. (Mrs. Haliburton was a daughter of\r\nmy father's old friend, Mr. Owen of Woodhouse. Her husband, Judge\r\nHaliburton, was the well-known author of 'Sam Slick.') Down, November 1\r\n[1872].\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Haliburton,\r\n\r\nI dare say you will be surprised to hear from me. My object in writing\r\nnow is to say that I have just published a book on the 'Expression of\r\nthe Emotions in Man and Animals;' and it has occurred to me that you\r\nmight possibly like to read some parts of it; and I can hardly think\r\nthat this would have been the case with any of the books which I have\r\nalready published. So I send by this post my present book. Although I\r\nhave had no communication with you or the other members of your family\r\nfor so long a time, no scenes in my whole life pass so frequently or so\r\nvividly before my mind as those which relate to happy old days spent at\r\nWoodhouse. I should very much like to hear a little news about yourself\r\nand the other members of your family, if you will take the trouble\r\nto write to me. Formerly I used to glean some news about you from my\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\nI have had many years of bad health and have not been able to visit\r\nanywhere; and now I feel very old. As long as I pass a perfectly uniform\r\nlife, I am able to do some daily work in Natural History, which is still\r\nmy passion, as it was in old days, when you used to laugh at me for\r\ncollecting beetles with such zeal at Woodhouse. Excepting from my\r\ncontinued il-health, which has excluded me from society, my life has\r\nbeen a very happy one; the greatest drawback being that several of my\r\nchildren have inherited from me feeble health. I hope with all my\r\nheart that you retain, at least to a large extent, the famous \"Owen\r\nconstitution.\" With sincere feelings of gratitude and affection for all\r\nbearing the name of Owen, I venture to sign myself,\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MRS. HALIBURTON. Down, November 6 [1872].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sarah,\r\n\r\nI have been very much pleased by your letter, which I must call\r\ncharming. I hardly ventured to think that you would have retained a\r\nfriendly recollection of me for so many years. Yet I ought to have felt\r\nassured that you would remain as warm-hearted and as true-hearted as\r\nyou have ever been from my earliest recollection. I know well how many\r\ngrievous sorrows you have gone through; but I am very sorry to hear that\r\nyour health is not good. In the spring or summer, when the weather is\r\nbetter, if you can summon up courage to pay us a visit here, both my\r\nwife, as she desires me to say, and myself, would be truly glad to see\r\nyou, and I know that you would not care about being rather dull here. It\r\nwould be a real pleasure to me to see you.--Thank you much for telling\r\nabout your family,--much of which was new to me. How kind you all were\r\nto me as a boy, and you especially, and how much happiness I owe to you.\r\nBelieve me your affectionate and obliged friend,\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Perhaps you would like to see a photograph of me now that I am\r\nold.\r\n\r\n\r\n1873.\r\n\r\n[The only work (other than botanical) of this year was the preparation\r\nof a second edition of the 'Descent of Man,' the publication of which\r\nis referred to in the following chapter. This work was undertaken\r\nmuch against the grain, as he was at the time deeply immersed in the\r\nmanuscript of 'Insectivorous Plants.' Thus he wrote to Mr. Wallace\r\n(November 19), \"I never in my lifetime regretted an interruption so much\r\nas this new edition of the 'Descent.'\" And later (in December) he wrote\r\nto Mr. Huxley: \"The new edition of the 'Descent' has turned out an awful\r\njob. It took me ten days merely to glance over letters and reviews with\r\ncriticisms and new facts. It is a devil of a job.\"\r\n\r\nThe work was continued until April 1, 1874, when he was able to return\r\nto his much loved Drosera. He wrote to Mr. Murray:--\r\n\r\n\"I have at last finished, after above three months as hard work as I\r\nhave ever had in my life, a corrected edition of the 'Descent,' and I\r\nmuch wish to have it printed off as soon as possible. As it is to be\r\nstereotyped I shall never touch it again.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of the miscellaneous letters of 1873 refers to a pleasant\r\nvisit received from Colonel Higginson of Newport, U.S.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO THOS. WENTWORTH HIGGINSON. Down, February 27th [1873].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nMy wife has just finished reading aloud your 'Life with a Black\r\nRegiment,' and you must allow me to thank you heartily for the very\r\ngreat pleasure which it has in many ways given us. I always thought well\r\nof the negroes, from the little which I have seen of them; and I\r\nhave been delighted to have my vague impressions confirmed, and their\r\ncharacter and mental powers so ably discussed. When you were here I did\r\nnot know of the noble position which you had filled. I had formerly read\r\nabout the black regiments, but failed to connect your name with your\r\nadmirable undertaking. Although we enjoyed greatly your visit to Down,\r\nmy wife and myself have over and over again regretted that we did not\r\nknow about the black regiment, as we should have greatly liked to have\r\nheard a little about the South from your own lips.\r\n\r\nYour descriptions have vividly recalled walks taken forty years ago in\r\nBrazil. We have your collected Essays, which were kindly sent us by Mr.\r\n[Moncure] Conway, but have not yet had time to read them. I occasionally\r\nglean a little news of you in the 'Index'; and within the last hour have\r\nread an interesting article of yours on the progress of Free Thought.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear sir, with sincere admiration, Yours very faithfully,\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[On May 28th he sent the following answers to the questions that Mr.\r\nGalton was at that time addressing to various scientific men, in the\r\ncourse of the inquiry which is given in his 'English Men of Science,\r\ntheir Nature and Nurture,' 1874. With regard to the questions my father\r\nwrote, \"I have filled up the answers as well as I could, but it is\r\nsimply impossible for me to estimate the degrees.\" For the sake of\r\nconvenience, the questions and answers relating to \"Nurture\" are made to\r\nprecede those on \"Nature\":\r\n\r\n\r\nNURTURE.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION?\r\n\r\nHow taught?

HAECKEL. Down, September 25, 1873.\r\n\r\nMy dear Haeckel,\r\n\r\nI thank you for the present of your book ('Schopfungs-geschichte,' 4th\r\nedition. The translation ('The History of Creation') was not published\r\nuntil 1876.), and I am heartily glad to see its great success. You will\r\ndo a wonderful amount of good in spreading the doctrine of Evolution,\r\nsupporting it as you do by so many original observations. I have read\r\nthe new preface with very great interest. The delay in the appearance\r\nof the English translation vexes and surprises me, for I have never been\r\nable to read it thoroughly in German, and I shall assuredly do so when\r\nit appears in English. Has the problem of the later stages of reduction\r\nof useless structures ever perplexed you? This problem has of late\r\ncaused me much perplexity. I have just written a letter to 'Nature' with\r\na hypothetical explanation of this difficulty, and I will send you the\r\npaper with the passage marked. I will at the same time send a paper\r\nwhich has interested me; it need not be returned. It contains a singular\r\nstatement bearing on so-called Spontaneous Generation. I much wish that\r\nthis latter question could be settled, but I see no prospect of it. If\r\nit could be proved true this would be most important to us...\r\n\r\nWishing you every success in your admirable labours,\r\n\r\nI remain, my dear Haeckel, yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.VIII. -- MISCELLANEA\r\n\r\nINCLUDING SECOND EDITIONS OF 'CORAL REEFS,' THE 'DESCENT OF\r\nMAN,' AND THE 'VARIATION OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS.'\r\n\r\n1874 AND 1875.\r\n\r\n[The year 1874 was given up to 'Insectivorous Plants,' with the\r\nexception of the months devoted to the second edition of the 'Descent\r\nof Man,' and with the further exception of the time given to a second\r\nedition of his 'Coral Reefs' (1874). The Preface to the latter states\r\nthat new facts have been added, the whole book revised, and \"the latter\r\nchapters almost rewritten.\" In the Appendix some account is given\r\nof Professor Semper's objections, and this was the occasion of\r\ncorrespondence between that naturalist and my father. In Professor\r\nSemper's volume, 'Animal Life' (one of the International Series), the\r\nauthor calls attention to the subject in the following passage which I\r\ngive in German, the published English translation being, as it seems to\r\nme, incorrect: \"Es scheint mir als ob er in der zweiten Ausgabe seines\r\nallgemein bekannten Werks uber Korallenriffe einem Irrthume uber meine\r\nBeobachtungen zum Opfer gefallen ist, indem er die Angaben, die ich\r\nallerdings bisher immer nur sehr kurz gehalten hatte, vollstandig falsch\r\nwiedergegeben hat.\"\r\n\r\nThe proof-sheets containing this passage were sent by Professor Semper\r\nto my father before 'Animal Life' was published, and this was the\r\noccasion for the following letter, which was afterwards published in\r\nProfessor Semper's book.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO K. SEMPER. Down, October 2, 1879.\r\n\r\nMy dear Professor Semper,\r\n\r\nI thank you for your extremely kind letter of the 19th, and for the\r\nproo-sheets. I believe that I understand all, excepting one or two\r\nsentences, where my imperfect knowledge of German has interfered. This\r\nis my sole and poor excuse for the mistake which I made in the second\r\nedition of my 'Coral' book. Your account of the Pellew Islands is a fine\r\naddition to our knowledge on coral reefs. I have very little to say\r\non the subject, even if I had formerly read your account and seen your\r\nmaps, but had known nothing of the proofs of recent elevation, and of\r\nyour belief that the islands have not since subsided. I have no doubt\r\nthat I should have considered them as formed during subsidence. But I\r\nshould have been much troubled in my mind by the sea not being so deep\r\nas it usually is round atolls, and by the reef on one side sloping so\r\ngradually beneath the sea; for this latter fact, as far as my memory\r\nserves me, is a very unusual and almost unparalleled case. I always\r\nforesaw that a bank at the proper depth beneath the surface would give\r\nrise to a reef which could not be distinguished from an atoll, formed\r\nduring subsidence. I must still adhere to my opinion that the atolls and\r\nbarrier reefs in the middle of the Pacific and Indian Oceans indicate\r\nsubsidence; but I fully agree with you that such cases as that of the\r\nPellew Islands, if of at all frequent occurrence, would make my general\r\nconclusions of very little value. Future observers must decide between\r\nus. It will be a strange fact if there has not been subsidence of the\r\nbeds of the great oceans, and if this has not affected the forms of the\r\ncoral reefs.\r\n\r\nIn the last three pages of the last sheet sent I am extremely glad\r\nto see that you are going to treat of the dispersion of animals. Your\r\npreliminary remarks seem to me quite excellent. There is nothing about\r\nM. Wagner, as I expected to find. I suppose that you have seen Moseley's\r\nlast book, which contains some good observations on dispersion.\r\n\r\nI am glad that your book will appear in English, for then I can read it\r\nwith ease. Pray believe me,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The most recent criticism on the Coral-reef theory is by Mr. Murray,\r\none of the staff of the \"Challenger\", who read a paper before the Royal\r\nSociety of Edinburgh, April 5, 1880. (An abstract is published in volume\r\nx. of the 'Proceedings,' page 505, and in 'Nature,' August 12, 1880.)\r\nThe chief point brought forward is the possibility of the building up of\r\nsubmarine mountains, which may serve as foundations for coral reefs. Mr.\r\nMurray also seeks to prove that \"the chief features of coral reefs and\r\nislands can be accounted for without calling in the aid of great and\r\ngeneral subsidence.\" The following letter refers to this subject:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A. AGASSIZ. Down, May 5, 1881.\r\n\r\n... You will have seen Mr. Murray's views on the formation of atolls and\r\nbarrier reefs. Before publishing my book, I thought long over the same\r\nview, but only as far as ordinary marine organisms are concerned, for at\r\nthat time little was known of the multitude of minute oceanic organisms.\r\nI rejected this view, as from the few dredgings made in the \"Beagle\",\r\nin the south temperate regions, I concluded that shells, the smaller\r\ncorals, etc., decayed, and were dissolved, when not protected by the\r\ndeposition of sediment, and sediment could not accumulate in the open\r\nocean. Certainly, shells, etc., were in several cases completely rotten,\r\nand crumbled into mud between my fingers; but you will know well whether\r\nthis is in any degree common. I have expressly said that a bank at\r\nthe proper depth would give rise to an atoll, which could not be\r\ndistinguished from one formed during subsidence. I can, however, hardly\r\nbelieve in the former presence of as many banks (there having been no\r\nsubsidence) as there are atolls in the great oceans, within a reasonable\r\ndepth, on which minute oceanic organisms could have accumulated to the\r\nthickness of many hundred feet... Pray forgive me for troubling you at\r\nsuch length, but it has occurred [to me] that you might be disposed\r\nto give, after your wide experience, your judgment. If I am wrong, the\r\nsooner I am knocked on the head and annihilated so much the better. It\r\nstill seems to me a marvellous thing that there should not have been\r\nmuch, and long continued, subsidence in the beds of the great oceans.\r\nI wish that some doubly rich millionaire would take it into his head to\r\nhave borings made in some of the Pacific and Indian atolls, and bring\r\nhome cores for slicing from a depth of 500 or 600 feet...\r\n\r\n\r\n[The second edition of the 'Descent of Man' was published in the autumn\r\nof 1874. Some severe remarks on the \"monistic hypothesis\" appeared in\r\nthe July (The review necessarily deals with the first edition of the\r\n'Descent of Man.') number of the 'Quarterly Review' (page 45). The\r\nReviewer expresses his astonishment at the ignorance of certain\r\nelementary distinctions and principles (e.g. with regard to the verbum\r\nmentale) exhibited, among others, by Mr. Darwin, who does not exhibit\r\nthe faintest indication of having grasped them, yet a clear perception\r\nof them, and a direct and detailed examination of his facts with regard\r\nto them, \"was a sine qua non for attempting, with a chance of success,\r\nthe solution of the mystery as to the descent of man.\"\r\n\r\nSome further criticisms of a later date may be here alluded to. In the\r\n'Academy,' 1876 (pages 562, 587), appeared a review of Mr. Mivart's\r\n'Lessons from Nature,' by Mr. Wallace. When considering the part of\r\nMr. Mivart's book relating to Natural and Sexual Selection, Mr. Wallace\r\nsays: \"In his violent attack on Mr. Darwin's theories our author uses\r\nunusually strong language. Not content with mere argument, he expresses\r\n'reprobation of Mr. Darwin's views'; and asserts that though he (Mr.\r\nDarwin) has been obliged, virtually, to give up his theory, it is still\r\nmaintained by Darwinians with 'unscrupulous audacity,' and the actual\r\nrepudiation of it concealed by the 'conspiracy of silence.'\" Mr. Wallace\r\ngoes on to show that these charges are without foundation, and points\r\nout that, \"if there is one thing more than another for which Mr. Darwin\r\nis pre-eminent among modern literary and scientific men, it is for his\r\nperfect literary honesty, his self-abnegation in confessing himself\r\nwrong, and the eager haste with which he proclaims and even magnifies\r\nsmall errors in his works, for the most part discovered by himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter to Mr. Wallace (June 17th) refers to\r\nMr. Mivart's statement ('Lessons from Nature,' page 144) that Mr. Darwin\r\nat first studiously disguised his views as to the \"bestiality of man\":--\r\n\r\n\"I have only just heard of and procured your two articles in the\r\nAcademy. I thank you most cordially for your generous defence of me\r\nagainst Mr. Mivart. In the 'Origin' I did not discuss the derivation\r\nof any one species; but that I might not be accused of concealing my\r\nopinion, I went out of my way, and inserted a sentence which seemed to\r\nme (and still so seems) to disclose plainly my belief. This was quoted\r\nin my 'Descent of Man.' Therefore it is very unjust,... of Mr. Mivart to\r\naccuse me of base fraudulent concealment.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter which here follows is of interest in connection with the\r\ndiscussion, in the 'Descent of Man,' on the origin of the musical sense\r\nin man:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO E. GURNEY. (Author of 'The Power of Sound.') Down,\r\nJuly 8, 1876.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Gurney,\r\n\r\nI have read your article (\"Some disputed Points in Music.\"--'Fortnightly\r\nReview,' July, 1876.) with much interest, except the latter part, which\r\nsoared above my ken. I am greatly pleased that you uphold my views to\r\na certain extent. Your criticism of the rasping noise made by insects\r\nbeing necessarily rhythmical is very good; but though not made\r\nintentionally, it may be pleasing to the females from the nerve cells\r\nbeing nearly similar in function throughout the animal kingdom. With\r\nrespect to your letter, I believe that I understand your meaning, and\r\nagree with you. I never supposed that the different degrees and kinds of\r\npleasure derived from different music could be explained by the musical\r\npowers of our semi-human progenitors. Does not the fact that different\r\npeople belonging to the same civilised nation are very differently\r\naffected by the same music, almost show that these diversities of taste\r\nand pleasure have been acquired during their individual lives? Your\r\nsimile of architecture seems to me particularly good; for in this case\r\nthe appreciation almost must be individual, though possibly the sense\r\nof sublimity excited by a grand cathedral, may have some connection with\r\nthe vague feelings of terror and superstition in our savage ancestors,\r\nwhen they entered a great cavern or gloomy forest. I wish some one could\r\nanalyse the feeling of sublimity. It amuses me to think how horrified\r\nsome high flying aesthetic men will be at your encouraging such low\r\ndegraded views as mine.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The letters which follow are of a miscellaneous interest. The first\r\nextract (from a letter, January 18, 1874) refers to a spiritualistic\r\nseance, held at Erasmus Darwin's house, 6 Queen Anne Street, under the\r\nauspices of a well-known medium:]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"... We had grand fun, one afternoon, for George hired a medium, who\r\nmade the chairs, a flute, a bell, and candlestick, and fiery points jump\r\nabout in my brother's diningroom, in a manner that astounded every one,\r\nand took away all their breaths. It was in the dark, but George and\r\nHensleigh Wedgwood held the medium's hands and feet on both sides all\r\nthe time. I found it so hot and tiring that I went away before all these\r\nastounding miracles, or jugglery, took place. How the man could possibly\r\ndo what was done passes my understanding. I came downstairs, and saw all\r\nthe chairs, etc., on the table, which had been lifted over the heads of\r\nthose sitting round it.\r\n\r\nThe Lord have mercy on us all, if we have to believe in such rubbish. F.\r\nGalton was there, and says it was a good seance...\"\r\n\r\nThe Seance in question led to a smaller and more carefully organised\r\none being undertaken, at which Mr. Huxley was present, and on which he\r\nreported to my father:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO PROFESSOR T.H. HUXLEY. Down, January 29 [1874].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nIt was very good of you to write so long an account. Though the seance\r\ndid tire you so much it was, I think, really worth the exertion, as the\r\nsame sort of things are done at all the seances, even at --'s; and now\r\nto my mind an enormous weight of evidence would be requisite to make one\r\nbelieve in anything beyond mere trickery... I am pleased to think that\r\nI declared to all my family, the day before yesterday, that the more\r\nI thought of all that I had heard happened at Queen Anne St., the more\r\nconvinced I was it was all imposture... my theory was that [the medium]\r\nmanaged to get the two men on each side of him to hold each other's\r\nhands, instead of his, and that he was thus free to perform his antics.\r\nI am very glad that I issued my ukase to you to attend.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the spring of this year (1874) he read a book which gave him great\r\npleasure and of which he often spoke with admiration:--'The Naturalist\r\nin Nicaragua,' by the late Thomas Belt. Mr. Belt, whose untimely death\r\nmay well be deplored by naturalists, was by profession an Engineer, so\r\nthat all his admirable observations in Natural History in Nicaragua and\r\nelsewhere were the fruit of his leisure. The book is direct and vivid\r\nin style and is full of description and suggestive discussions. With\r\nreference to it my father wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"Belt I have read, and I am delighted that you like it so much, it\r\nappears to me the best of all natural history journals which have ever\r\nbeen published.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO THE MARQUIS DE SAPORTA. Down, May 30, 1874.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have been very neglectful in not having sooner thanked you for your\r\nkindness in having sent me your 'Etudes sur la Vegetation,' etc., and\r\nother memoirs. I have read several of them with very great interest, and\r\nnothing can be more important, in my opinion, than your evidence of\r\nthe extremely slow and gradual manner in which specific forms change. I\r\nobserve that M. A. De Candolle has lately quoted you on this head versus\r\nHeer. I hope that you may be able to throw light on the question whether\r\nsuch protean, or polymorphic forms, as those of Rubus, Hieracium, etc.,\r\nat the present day, are those which generate new species; as for myself,\r\nI have always felt some doubt on this head. I trust that you may soon\r\nbring many of your countrymen to believe in Evolution, and my name\r\nwill then perhaps cease to be scorned. With the most sincere respect, I\r\nremain, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours faithfully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, June 5 [1874].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI have now read your article (The article, \"Charles Darwin,\" in the\r\nseries of \"Scientific Worthies\" ('Nature,' June 4, 1874). This admirable\r\nestimate of my father's work in science is given in the form of a\r\ncomparison and contrast between Robert Brown and Charles Darwin.) in\r\n'Nature,' and the last two paragraphs were not included in the slip sent\r\nbefore. I wrote yesterday and cannot remember exactly what I said, and\r\nnow cannot be easy without again telling you how profoundly I have been\r\ngratified. Every one, I suppose, occasionally thinks that he has worked\r\nin vain, and when one of these fits overtakes me, I will think of your\r\narticle, and if that does not dispel the evil spirit, I shall know that\r\nI am at the time a little bit insane, as we all are occasionally.\r\n\r\nWhat you say about Teleology (\"Let us recognise Darwin's great service\r\nto Natural Science in bringing back to it Teleology: so that instead\r\nof Morphology versus Teleology, we shall have Morphology wedded to\r\nTeleology.\") pleases me especially, and I do not think any one else\r\nhas ever noticed the point. (See, however, Mr. Huxley's chapter on the\r\n'Reception of the Origin of Species' in volume i.) I have always said\r\nyou were the man to hit the nail on the head.\r\n\r\nYours gratefully and affectionately, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[As a contribution to the history of the reception of the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies,' the meeting of the British Association in 1874, at Belfast,\r\nshould be mentioned. It is memorable for Professor Tyndall's brilliant\r\npresidential address, in which a sketch of the history of Evolution is\r\ngiven culminating in an eloquent analysis of the 'Origin of Species,'\r\nand of the nature of its great success. With regard to Prof. Tyndall's\r\naddress, Lyell wrote ('Life,' ii. page 455) congratulating my father on\r\nthe meeting, \"on which occasion you and your theory of Evolution may\r\nbe fairly said to have had an ovation.\" In the same letter Sir Charles\r\nspeaks of a paper (On the Ancient Volcanoes of the Highlands, 'Journal\r\nof Geological Soc.,' 1874.) of Professor Judd's, and it is to this that\r\nthe following letter refers:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, September 23, 1874.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI suppose that you have returned, or will soon return, to London (Sir\r\nCharles Lyell returned from Scotland towards the end of September.);\r\nand, I hope, reinvigorated by your outing. In your last letter you\r\nspoke of Mr. Judd's paper on the Volcanoes of the Hebrides. I have just\r\nfinished it, and to ease my mind must express my extreme admiration.\r\n\r\nIt is years since I have read a purely geological paper which has\r\ninterested me so greatly. I was all the more interested, as in the\r\nCordillera I often speculated on the sources of the deluges of submarine\r\nporphyritic lavas, of which they are built; and, as I have stated, I\r\nsaw to a certain extent the causes of the obliteration of the points\r\nof eruption. I was also not a little pleased to see my volcanic book\r\nquoted, for I thought it was completely dead and forgotten. What fine\r\nwork will Mr. Judd assuredly do!... Now I have eased my mind; and so\r\nfarewell, with both E.D.'s and C.D.'s very kind remembrances to Miss\r\nLyell.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sir Charles Lyell's reply to the above letter must have been one of the\r\nlatest that my father received from his old friend, and it is with this\r\nletter that the volumes of his published correspondence closes.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO AUG. FOREL. Down, October 15, 1874.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have now read the whole of your admirable work ('Les Fourmis de la\r\nSuisse,' 4to, 1874.) and seldom in my life have I been more interested\r\nby any book. There are so many interesting facts and discussions, that I\r\nhardly know which to specify; but I think, firstly, the newest points\r\nto me have been about the size of the brain in the three sexes, together\r\nwith your suggestion that increase of mind power may have led to the\r\nsterility of the workers. Secondly about the battles of the ants, and\r\nyour curious account of the enraged ants being held by their comrades\r\nuntil they calmed down. Thirdly, the evidence of ants of the same\r\ncommunity being the offspring of brothers and sisters. You admit, I\r\nthink, that new communities will often be the product of a cross between\r\nnot-related ants. Fritz Muller has made some interesting observations\r\non this head with respect to Termites. The case of Anergates is most\r\nperplexing in many ways, but I have such faith in the law of occasional\r\ncrossing that I believe an explanation will hereafter be found, such\r\nas the dimorphism of either sex and the occasional production of\r\nwinged males. I see that you are puzzled how ants of the same community\r\nrecognize each other; I once placed two (F. rufa) in a pill-box smelling\r\nstrongly of asafoetida and after a day returned them to their homes;\r\nthey were threatened, but at last recognized. I made the trial thinking\r\nthat they might know each other by their odour; but this cannot have\r\nbeen the case, and I have often fancied that they must have some common\r\nsignal. Your last chapter is one great mass of wonderful facts and\r\nsuggestions, and the whole profoundly interesting. I have seldom been\r\nmore gratified than by [your] honourable mention of my work.\r\n\r\nI should like to tell you one little observation which I made with care\r\nmany years ago; I saw ants (Formica rufa) carrying cocoons from a nest\r\nwhich was the largest I ever saw and which was well-known to all the\r\ncountry people near, and an old man, apparently about eighty years of\r\nage, told me that he had known it ever since he was a boy. The ants\r\ncarrying the cocoons did not appear to be emigrating; following the\r\nline, I saw many ascending a tall fir tree still carrying their cocoons.\r\nBut when I looked closely I found that all the cocoons were empty cases.\r\nThis astonished me, and next day I got a man to observe with me, and we\r\nagain saw ants bringing empty cocoons out of the nest; each of us fixed\r\non one ant and slowly followed it, and repeated the observation on many\r\nothers. We thus found that some ants soon dropped their empty cocoons;\r\nothers carried them for many yards, as much as thirty paces, and others\r\ncarried them high up the fir tree out of sight. Now here I think we\r\nhave one instinct in contest with another and mistaken one. The first\r\ninstinct being to carry the empty cocoons out of the nest, and it would\r\nhave been sufficient to have laid them on the heap of rubbish, as the\r\nfirst breath of wind would have blown them away. And then came in the\r\ncontest with the other very powerful instinct of preserving and carrying\r\ntheir cocoons as long as possible; and this they could not help doing\r\nalthough the cocoons were empty. According as the one or other instinct\r\nwas the stronger in each individual ant, so did it carry the empty\r\ncocoon to a greater or less distance. If this little observation should\r\never prove of any use to you, you are quite at liberty to use it. Again\r\nthanking you cordially for the great pleasure which your work has given\r\nme, I remain with much respect,\r\n\r\nYours sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--If you read English easily I should like to send you Mr. Belt's\r\nbook, as I think you would like it as much as did Fritz Muller.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J. FISKE. Down, December 8, 1874.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYou must allow me to thank you for the very great interest with which\r\nI have at last slowly read the whole of your work. ('Outlines of Cosmic\r\nPhilosophy,' 2 volumes, 8vo. 1874.) I have long wished to know something\r\nabout the views of the many great men whose doctrines you give. With\r\nthe exception of special points I did not even understand H. Spencer's\r\ngeneral doctrine; for his style is too hard work for me. I never in my\r\nlife read so lucid an expositor (and therefore thinker) as you are; and\r\nI think that I understand nearly the whole--perhaps less clearly about\r\nCosmic Theism and Causation than other parts. It is hopeless to attempt\r\nout of so much to specify what has interested me most, and probably you\r\nwould not care to hear. I wish some chemist would attempt to ascertain\r\nthe result of the cooling of heated gases of the proper kinds, in\r\nrelation to your hypothesis of the origin of living matter. It pleased\r\nme to find that here and there I had arrived from my own crude thoughts\r\nat some of the same conclusions with you; though I could seldom or never\r\nhave given my reasons for such conclusions. I find that my mind is\r\nso fixed by the inducive method, that I cannot appreciate deductive\r\nreasoning: I must begin with a good body of facts and not from a\r\nprinciple (in which I always suspect some fallacy) and then as much\r\ndeduction as you please. This may be very narrow-minded; but the result\r\nis that such parts of H. Spencer, as I have read with care impress my\r\nmind with the idea of his inexhaustible wealth of suggestion, but never\r\nconvince me; and so I find it with some others. I believe the cause to\r\nlie in the frequency with which I have found first-formed theories [to\r\nbe] erroneous. I thank you for the honourable mention which you make\r\nof my works. Parts of the 'Descent of Man' must have appeared laughably\r\nweak to you: nevertheless, I have sent you a new edition just published.\r\nThanking you for the profound interest and profit with which I have read\r\nyour work. I remain,\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, yours very faithfully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1875.\r\n\r\n[The only work, not purely botanical, which occupied my father in the\r\npresent year was the correction of the second edition of 'The Variation\r\nof Animals and Plants,' and on this he was engaged from the beginning of\r\nJuly till October 3rd. The rest of the year was taken up with his work\r\non insectivorous plants, and on cross-fertilisation, as will be shown in\r\na later chapter. The chief alterations in the second edition of 'Animals\r\nand Plants' are in the eleventh chapter on \"Bud-variation and on certain\r\nanomalous modes of reproduction;\" the chapter on Pangenesis \"was also\r\nlargely altered and remodelled.\" He mentions briefly some of the authors\r\nwho have noticed the doctrine. Professor Delpino's 'Sulla Darwiniana\r\nTeoria della Pangenesi' (1869), an adverse but fair criticism, seems\r\nto have impressed him as valuable. Of another critique my father\r\ncharacteristically says ('Animals and Plants,' 2nd edition volume ii.\r\npage 350.), \"Dr. Lionel Beale ('Nature,' May 11, 1871, page 26) sneers\r\nat the whole doctrine with much acerbity and some justice.\" He also\r\npoints out that, in Mantegazza's 'Elementi di Igiene,' the theory of\r\nPangenesis was clearly foreseen.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject, a letter of my father's to 'Nature'\r\n(April 27, 1871) should be mentioned. A paper by Mr. Galton had been\r\nread before the Royal Society (March 30, 1871) in which were described\r\nexperiments, on intertransfusion of blood, designed to test the truth of\r\nthe hypothesis of pangenesis. My father, while giving all due credit to\r\nMr. Galton for his ingenious experiments, does not allow that pangenesis\r\nhas \"as yet received its death-blow, though from presenting so many\r\nvulnerable points its life is always in jeopardy.\"\r\n\r\nHe seems to have found the work of correcting very wearisome, for he\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n\"I have no news about myself, as I am merely slaving over the sickening\r\nwork of preparing new editions. I wish I could get a touch of poor\r\nLyell's feelings, that it was delightful to improve a sentence, like a\r\npainter improving a picture.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeling of effort or strain over this piece of work, is shown in a\r\nletter to Professor Haeckel:--\r\n\r\n\"What I shall do in future if I live, Heaven only knows; I ought perhaps\r\nto avoid general and large subjects, as too difficult for me with my\r\nadvancing years, and I suppose enfeebled brain.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of March, in this year, the portrait for which he was sitting\r\nto Mr. Ouless was finished. He felt the sittings a great fatigue, in\r\nspite of Mr. Ouless's considerate desire to spare him as far as was\r\npossible. In a letter to Sir J.D. Hooker he wrote, \"I look a very\r\nvenerable, acute, melancholy old dog; whether I really look so I do not\r\nknow.\" The picture is in the possession of the family, and is known\r\nto many through M. Rajon's etching. Mr. Ouless's portrait is, in my\r\nopinion, the finest representation of my father that has been produced.\r\n\r\nThe following letter refers to the death of Sir Charles Lyell, which\r\ntook place on February 22nd, 1875, in his seventy-eighth year.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MISS BUCKLEY (NOW MRS. FISHER). (Mrs. Fisher acted as\r\nSecretary to Sir Charles Lyell.) Down, February 23, 1875.\r\n\r\nMy dear Miss Buckley,\r\n\r\nI am grieved to hear of the death of my old and kind friend, though I\r\nknew that it could not be long delayed, and that it was a happy thing\r\nthat his life should not have been prolonged, as I suppose that his mind\r\nwould inevitably have suffered. I am glad that Lady Lyell (Lady Lyell\r\ndied in 1873.) has been saved this terrible blow. His death makes me\r\nthink of the time when I first saw him, and how full of sympathy and\r\ninterest he was about what I could tell him of coral reefs and South\r\nAmerica. I think that this sympathy with the work of every other\r\nnaturalist was one of the finest features of his character. How\r\ncompletely he revolutionised Geology: for I can remember something of\r\npre-Lyellian days.\r\n\r\nI never forget that almost everything which I have done in science I\r\nowe to the study of his great works. Well, he has had a grand and happy\r\ncareer, and no one ever worked with a truer zeal in a noble cause. It\r\nseems strange to me that I shall never again sit with him and Lady Lyell\r\nat their breakfast. I am very much obliged to you for having so kindly\r\nwritten to me.\r\n\r\nPray give our kindest remembrances to Miss Lyell, and I hope that she\r\nhas not suffered much in health, from fatigue and anxiety.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Miss Buckley, Yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, February 25 [1875].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYour letter so full of feeling has interested me greatly. I cannot say\r\nthat I felt his [Lyell's] death much, for I fully expected it, and have\r\nlooked for some little time at his career as finished.\r\n\r\nI dreaded nothing so much as his surviving with impaired mental powers.\r\nHe was, indeed, a noble man in very many ways; perhaps in none more than\r\nin his warm sympathy with the work of others. How vividly I can recall\r\nmy first conversation with him, and how he astonished me by his interest\r\nin what I told him. How grand also was his candour and pure love of\r\ntruth. Well, he is gone, and I feel as if we were all soon to go... I\r\nam deeply rejoiced about Westminster Abbey (Sir C. Lyell was buried in\r\nWestminster Abbey.), the possibility of which had not occurred to me\r\nwhen I wrote before. I did think that his works were the most enduring\r\nof all testimonials (as you say) to him; but then I did not like the\r\nidea of his passing away with no outward sign of what scientific men\r\nthought of his merits. Now all this is changed, and nothing can be\r\nbetter than Westminster Abbey. Mrs. Lyell has asked me to be one of the\r\npall-bearers, but I have written to say that I dared not, as I should so\r\nlikely fail in the midst of the ceremony, and have my head whirling off\r\nmy shoulders. All this affair must have cost you much fatigue and worry,\r\nand how I do wish you were out of England...\r\n\r\n\r\n[In 1881 he wrote to Mrs. Fisher in reference to her article on Sir\r\nCharles Lyell in the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica':--\r\n\r\n\"For such a publication I suppose you do not want to say much about\r\nhis private character, otherwise his strong sense of humour and love of\r\nsociety might have been added. Also his extreme interest in the progress\r\nof the world, and in the happiness of mankind. Also his freedom from all\r\nreligious bigotry, though these perhaps would be a superfluity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following refers to the Zoological station at Naples, a subject on\r\nwhich my father felt an enthusiastic interest:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ANTON DOHRN. Down, [1875?].\r\n\r\nMy dear Dr. Dohrn,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your most kind letter, I most heartily rejoice at your\r\nimproved health and at the success of your grand undertaking, which will\r\nhave so much influence on the progress of Zoology throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nIf we look to England alone, what capital work has already been done at\r\nthe Station by Balfour and Ray Lankester... When you come to England, I\r\nsuppose that you will bring Mrs. Dohrn, and we shall be delighted to see\r\nyou both here. I have often boasted that I have had a live Uhlan in my\r\nhouse! It will be very interesting to me to read your new views on the\r\nancestry of the Vertebrates. I shall be sorry to give up the Ascidians,\r\nto whom I feel profound gratitude; but the great thing, as it appears to\r\nme, is that any link whatever should be found between the main divisions\r\nof the Animal Kingdom...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO AUGUST WEISMANN. Down, December 6, 1875.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have been profoundly interested by your essay on Amblystoma\r\n('Umwandlung des Axolotl.'), and think that you have removed a great\r\nstumbling block in the way of Evolution. I once thought of reversion in\r\nthis case; but in a crude and imperfect manner. I write now to call your\r\nattention to the sterility of moths when hatched out of their proper\r\nseason; I give references in chapter 18 of my 'Variation under\r\nDomestication' (volume ii. page 157, of English edition), and these\r\ncases illustrate, I think, the sterility of Amblystoma. Would it not be\r\nworth while to examine the reproductive organs of those individuals of\r\nWINGLESS Hemiptera which occasionally have wings, as in the case of the\r\nbed-bug. I think I have heard that the females of Mutilla sometimes have\r\nwings. These cases must be due to reversion. I dare say many anomalous\r\ncases will be hereafter explained on the same principle.\r\n\r\nI hinted at this explanation in the extraordinary case of the\r\nblac-shouldered peacock, the so-called Pavo nigripennis given in my\r\n'Variation under Domestication;' and I might have been bolder, as the\r\nvariety is in many respects intermediate between the two known species.\r\n\r\nWith much respect, Yours sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VIVISECTION QUESTION.\r\n\r\n[It was in November 1875 that my father gave his evidence before the\r\nRoyal Commission on Vivisection. (See volume i.) I have, therefore,\r\nplaced together here the matter relating to this subject, irrespective\r\nof date. Something has already been said of my father's strong feeling\r\nwith regard to suffering both in man and beast. It was indeed one of the\r\nstrongest feelings in his nature, and was exemplified in matters small\r\nand great, in his sympathy with the educational miseries of dancing\r\ndogs, or in his horror at the sufferings of slaves. (He once made an\r\nattempt to free a patient in a mad-house, who (as he wrongly supposed)\r\nwas sane. He had some correspondence with the gardener at the asylum,\r\nand on one occasion he found a letter from a patient enclosed with one\r\nfrom the gardener. The letter was rational in tone and declared that the\r\nwriter was sane and wrongfully confined.\r\n\r\nMy father wrote to the Lunacy Commissioners (without explaining the\r\nsource of his information) and in due time heard that the man had been\r\nvisited by the Commissioners, and that he was certainly insane. Sometime\r\nafterwards the patient was discharged, and wrote to thank my father for\r\nhis interference, adding that he had undoubtedly been insane, when he\r\nwrote his former letter.)\r\n\r\nThe remembrance of screams, or other sounds heard in Brazil, when he\r\nwas powerless to interfere with what he believed to be the torture of a\r\nslave, haunted him for years, especially at night. In smaller matters,\r\nwhere he could interfere, he did so vigorously. He returned one day from\r\nhis walk pale and faint from having seen a horse ill-used, and from the\r\nagitation of violently remonstrating with the man. On another occasion\r\nhe saw a hors-breaker teaching his son to ride, the little boy was\r\nfrightened and the man was rough; my father stopped, and jumping out of\r\nthe carriage reproved the man in no measured terms.\r\n\r\nOne other little incident may be mentioned, showing that his humanity to\r\nanimals was well-known in his own neighbourhood. A visitor, driving from\r\nOrpington to Down, told the man to go faster, \"Why,\" said the driver,\r\n\"If I had whipped the horse THIS much, driving Mr. Darwin, he would have\r\ngot out of the carriage and abused me well.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to the special point under consideration,--the sufferings\r\nof animals subjected to experiment,--nothing could show a stronger\r\nfeeling than the following extract from a letter to Professor Ray\r\nLankester (March 22, 1871):--\r\n\r\n\"You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree that it is\r\njustifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere\r\ndamnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick\r\nwith horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not\r\nsleep to-night.\"\r\n\r\nAn extract from Sir Thomas Farrer's notes shows how strongly he\r\nexpressed himself in a similar manner in conversation:--\r\n\r\n\"The last time I had any conversation with him was at my house in\r\nBryanston Square, just before one of his last seizures. He was then\r\ndeeply interested in the vivisection question; and what he said made a\r\ndeep impression on me. He was a man eminently fond of animals and\r\ntender to them; he would not knowingly have inflicted pain on a living\r\ncreature; but he entertained the strongest opinion that to prohibit\r\nexperiments on living animals, would be to put a stop to the knowledge\r\nof and the remedies for pain and disease.\"\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Vivisection agitation, to which the following letters refer,\r\nseems to have become specially active in 1874, as may be seen, e.g. by\r\nthe index to 'Nature' for that year, in which the word \"Vivisection,\"\r\nsuddenly comes into prominence. But before that date the subject had\r\nreceived the earnest attention of biologists. Thus at the Liverpool\r\nMeeting of the British Association in 1870, a Committee was appointed,\r\nwhich reported, defining the circumstances and conditions under which,\r\nin the opinion of the signatories, experiments on living animals were\r\njustifiable. In the spring of 1875, Lord Hartismere introduced a Bill\r\ninto the Upper House to regulate the course of physiological research.\r\nShortly afterwards a Bill more just towards science in its provisions\r\nwas introduced to the House of Commons by Messrs. Lyon Playfair,\r\nWalpole, and Ashley. It was, however, withdrawn on the appointment of a\r\nRoyal Commission to inquire into the whole question. The Commissioners\r\nwere Lords Cardwell and Winmarleigh, Mr. W.E. Forster, Sir J.B.\r\nKarslake, Mr. Huxley, Professor Erichssen, and Mr. R.H. Hutton: they\r\ncommenced their inquiry in July, 1875, and the Report was published\r\nearly in the following year.\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of 1876, Lord Carnarvon's Bill, entitled, \"An Act to\r\namend the Law relating to Cruelty to Animals,\" was introduced. It cannot\r\nbe denied that the framers of this Bill, yielding to the unreasonable\r\nclamour of the public, went far beyond the recommendations of the Royal\r\nCommission. As a correspondent in 'Nature' put it (1876, page 248),\r\n\"the evidence on the strength of which legislation was recommended\r\nwent beyond the facts, the Report went beyond the evidence, the\r\nRecommendations beyond the Report; and the Bill can hardly be said to\r\nhave gone beyond the Recommendations; but rather to have contradicted\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe legislation which my father worked for, as described in the\r\nfollowing letters, was practically what was introduced as Dr. Lyon\r\nPlayfair's Bill.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MRS. LITCHFIELD. (His daughter.) January 4, 1875.\r\n\r\nMy dear H.\r\n\r\nYour letter has led me to think over vivisection (I wish some new\r\nword like anaes-section could be invented (He communicated to 'Nature'\r\n(September 30, 1880) an article by Dr. Wilder, of Cornell University, an\r\nabstract of which was published (page 517). Dr. Wilder advocated the use\r\nof the word 'Callisection' for painless operations on animals.) for\r\nsome hours, and I will jot down my conclusions, which will appear\r\nvery unsatisfactory to you. I have long thought physiology one of the\r\ngreatest of sciences, sure sooner, or more probably later, greatly to\r\nbenefit mankind; but, judging from all other sciences, the benefits will\r\naccrue only indirectly in the search for abstract truth. It is certain\r\nthat physiology can progress only by experiments on living animals.\r\nTherefore the proposal to limit research to points of which we can now\r\nsee the bearings in regard to health, etc., I look at as puerile.\r\nI thought at first it would be good to limit vivisection to public\r\nlaboratories; but I have heard only of those in London and Cambridge,\r\nand I think Oxford; but probably there may be a few others. Therefore\r\nonly men living in a few great towns would carry on investigation, and\r\nthis I should consider a great evil. If private men were permitted to\r\nwork in their own houses, and required a licence, I do not see who is\r\nto determine whether any particular man should receive one. It is young\r\nunknown men who are the most likely to do good work. I would gladly\r\npunish severely any one who operated on an animal not rendered\r\ninsensible, if the experiment made this possible; but here again I do\r\nnot see that a magistrate or jury could possibly determine such a point.\r\nTherefore I conclude, if (as is likely) some experiments have been tried\r\ntoo often, or anaesthetics have not been used when they could have been,\r\nthe cure must be in the improvement of humanitarian feelings. Under this\r\npoint of view I have rejoiced at the present agitation. If stringent\r\nlaws are passed, and this is likely, seeing how unscientific the House\r\nof Commons is, and that the gentlemen of England are humane, as long\r\nas their sports are not considered, which entailed a hundred or\r\nthousand-fold more suffering than the experiments of physiologists--if\r\nsuch laws are passed, the result will assuredly be that physiology,\r\nwhich has been until within the last few years at a standstill in\r\nEngland, will languish or quite cease. It will then be carried on solely\r\non the Continent; and there will be so many the fewer workers on this\r\ngrand subject, and this I should greatly regret. By the way, F. Balfour,\r\nwho has worked for two or three years in the laboratory at Cambridge,\r\ndeclares to George that he has never seen an experiment, except with\r\nanimals rendered insensible. No doubt the names of Doctors will have\r\ngreat weight with the House of Commons; but very many practitioners\r\nneither know nor care anything about the progress of knowledge. I\r\ncannot at present see my way to sign any petition, without hearing what\r\nphysiologists thought would be its effect, and then judging for myself.\r\nI certainly could not sign the paper sent me by Miss Cobbe, with its\r\nmonstrous (as it seems to me) attack on Virchow for experimenting on the\r\nTrichinae. I am tired and so no more.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 14 [1875].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI worked all the time in London on the vivisection question; and we now\r\nthink it advisable to go further than a mere petition. Litchfield\r\n(Mr. R.B. Litchfield, his son-in-law.) drew up a sketch of a Bill, the\r\nessential features of which have been approved by Sanderson, Simon and\r\nHuxley, and from conversation, will, I believe, be approved by Paget,\r\nand almost certainly, I think, by Michael Foster. Sanderson, Simon and\r\nPaget wish me to see Lord Derby, and endeavour to gain his advocacy with\r\nthe Home Secretary. Now, if this is carried into effect, it will be of\r\ngreat importance to me to be able to say that the Bill in its essential\r\nfeatures has the approval of some half-dozen eminent scientific men. I\r\nhave therefore asked Litchfield to enclose a copy to you in its first\r\nrough form; and if it is not essentially modified may I say that it\r\nmeets with your approval as President of the Royal Society? The object\r\nis to protect animals, and at the same time not to injure Physiology,\r\nand Huxley and Sanderson's approval almost suffices on this head. Pray\r\nlet me have a line from you soon.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Physiological Society, which was founded in 1876, was in some\r\nmeasure the outcome of the anti-vivisection movement, since it was this\r\nagitation which impressed on Physiologists the need of a centre for\r\nthose engaged in this particular branch of science. With respect to the\r\nSociety, my father wrote to Mr. Romanes (May 29, 1876):--\r\n\r\n\"I was very much gratified by the wholly unexpected honour of being\r\nelected one of the Honorary Members. This mark of sympathy has pleased\r\nme to a very high degree.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter appeared in the \"Times\", April 18th, 1881:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO FRITHIOF HOLMGREN. (Professor of Physiology at\r\nUpsala.) Down, April 14, 1881.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nIn answer to your courteous letter of April 7, I have no objection to\r\nexpress my opinion with respect to the right of experimenting on living\r\nanimals. I use this latter expression as more correct and comprehensive\r\nthan that of vivisection. You are at liberty to make any use of this\r\nletter which you may think fit, but if published I should wish the whole\r\nto appear. I have all my life been a strong advocate for humanity to\r\nanimals, and have done what I could in my writings to enforce this duty.\r\nSeveral years ago, when the agitation against physiologists commenced in\r\nEngland, it was asserted that inhumanity was here practised, and useless\r\nsuffering caused to animals; and I was led to think that it might be\r\nadvisable to have an Act of Parliament on the subject. I then took an\r\nactive part in trying to get a Bill passed, such as would have\r\nremoved all just cause of complaint, and at the same time have left\r\nphysiologists free to pursue their researches,--a Bill very different\r\nfrom the Act which has since been passed. It is right to add that\r\nthe investigation of the matter by a Royal Commission proved that the\r\naccusations made against our English physiologists were false. From all\r\nthat I have heard, however, I fear that in some parts of Europe little\r\nregard is paid to the sufferings of animals, and if this be the case,\r\nI should be glad to hear of legislation against inhumanity in any such\r\ncountry. On the other hand, I know that physiology cannot possibly\r\nprogress except by means of experiments on living animals, and I feel\r\nthe deepest conviction that he who retards the progress of physiology\r\ncommits a crime against mankind. Any one who remembers, as I can, the\r\nstate of this science half a century ago, must admit that it has made\r\nimmense progress, and it is now progressing at an ever-increasing rate.\r\nWhat improvements in medical practice may be directly attributed to\r\nphysiological research is a question which can be properly discussed\r\nonly by those physiologists and medical practitioners who have studied\r\nthe history of their subjects; but, as far as I can learn, the benefits\r\nare already great. However this may be, no one, unless he is grossly\r\nignorant of what science has done for mankind, can entertain any doubt\r\nof the incalculable benefits which will hereafter be derived from\r\nphysiology, not only by man, but by the lower animals. Look for instance\r\nat Pasteur's results in modifying the germs of the most malignant\r\ndiseases, from which, as it so happens, animals will in the first place\r\nreceive more relief than man. Let it be remembered how many lives and\r\nwhat a fearful amount of suffering have been saved by the knowledge\r\ngained of parasitic worms through the experiments of Virchow and others\r\non living animals. In the future every one will be astonished at the\r\ningratitude shown, at least in England, to these benefactors of mankind.\r\nAs for myself, permit me to assure you that I honour, and shall always\r\nhonour, every one who advances the noble science of physiology.\r\n\r\nDear Sir, yours faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the \"Times\" of the following day appeared a letter headed \"Mr.\r\nDarwin and Vivisection,\" signed by Miss Frances Power Cobbe. To this\r\nmy father replied in the \"Times\" of April 22, 1881. On the same day he\r\nwrote to Mr. Romanes:--\r\n\r\n\"As I have a fair opportunity, I sent a letter to the \"Times\" on\r\nVivisection, which is printed to-day. I thought it fair to bear my share\r\nof the abuse poured in so atrocious a manner on all physiologists.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI do not wish to discuss the views expressed by Miss Cobbe in the letter\r\nwhich appeared in the \"Times\" of the 19th inst.; but as she asserts\r\nthat I have \"misinformed\" my correspondent in Sweden in saying that\r\n\"the investigation of the matter by a Royal Commission proved that the\r\naccusations made against our English physiologists were false,\" I will\r\nmerely ask leave to refer to some other sentences from the Report of the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n1. The sentence--\"It is not to be doubted that inhumanity may be found\r\nin persons of very high position as physiologists,\" which Miss Cobbe\r\nquotes from page 17 of the report, and which, in her opinion, \"can\r\nnecessarily concern English physiologists alone and not foreigners,\"\r\nis immediately followed by the words \"We have seen that it was so in\r\nMagendie.\" Magendie was a French physiologist who became notorious some\r\nhalf century ago for his cruel experiments on living animals.\r\n\r\n2. The Commissioners, after speaking of the \"general sentiment of\r\nhumanity\" prevailing in this country, say (page 10):--\r\n\r\n\"This principle is accepted generally by the very highly educated men\r\nwhose lives are devoted either to scientific investigation and\r\neducation or to the mitigation or the removal of the sufferings of\r\ntheir fellow-creatures; though differences of degree in regard to its\r\npractical application will be easily discernible by those who study the\r\nevidence as it has been laid before us.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, according to the Commissioners (page 10):--\r\n\r\n\"The secretary of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to\r\nAnimals, when asked whether the general tendency of the scientific world\r\nin this country is at variance with humanity, says he believes it to be\r\nvery different, indeed, from that of foreign physiologists; and while\r\ngiving it as the opinion of the society that experiments are performed\r\nwhich are in their nature beyond any legitimate province of science, and\r\nthat the pain which they inflict is pain which it is not justifiable to\r\ninflict even for the scientific object in view, he readily acknowledges\r\nthat he does not know a single case of wanton cruelty, and that in\r\ngeneral the English physiologists have used anaesthetics where they\r\nthink they can do so with safety to the experiment.\"\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your obedient servant, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nApril 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the \"Times\" of Saturday, April 23, 1881, appeared a letter from Miss\r\nCobbe in reply:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO G.J. ROMANES. Down, April 25, 1881.\r\n\r\nMy dear Romanes,\r\n\r\nI was very glad to read your last note with much news interesting to\r\nme. But I write now to say how I, and indeed all of us in the house\r\nhave admired your letter in the \"Times\". (April 25, 1881.--Mr. Romanes\r\ndefended Dr. Sanderson against the accusations made by Miss Cobbe.)\r\nIt was so simple and direct. I was particularly glad about Burton\r\nSanderson, of whom I have been for several years a great admirer. I was\r\nalso especially glad to read the last sentences. I have been bothered\r\nwith several letters, but none abusive. Under a SELFISH point of view\r\nI am very glad of the publication of your letter, as I was at first\r\ninclined to think that I had done mischief by stirring up the mud. Now\r\nI feel sure that I have done good. Mr. Jesse has written to me very\r\npolitely, he says his Society has had nothing to do with placards and\r\ndiagrams against physiology, and I suppose, therefore, that these\r\nall originate with Miss Cobbe... Mr. Jesse complains bitterly that\r\nthe \"Times\" will \"burke\" all his letters to this newspaper, nor am I\r\nsurprised, judging from the laughable tirades advertised in \"Nature\".\r\n\r\nEver yours, very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The next letter refers to a projected conjoint article on vivisection,\r\nto which Mr. Romanes wished my father to contribute:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO G.J. ROMANES. Down, September 2, 1881.\r\n\r\nMy dear Romanes,\r\n\r\nYour letter has perplexed me beyond all measure. I fully recognise\r\nthe duty of every one whose opinion is worth anything, expressing his\r\nopinion publicly on vivisection; and this made me send my letter to the\r\n\"Times\". I have been thinking at intervals all morning what I could say,\r\nand it is the simple truth that I have nothing worth saying. You and\r\nmen like you, whose ideas flow freely, and who can express them easily,\r\ncannot understand the state of mental paralysis in which I find myself.\r\nWhat is most wanted is a careful and accurate attempt to show what\r\nphysiology has already done for man, and even still more strongly\r\nwhat there is every reason to believe it will hereafter do. Now I am\r\nabsolutely incapable of doing this, or of discussing the other points\r\nsuggested by you.\r\n\r\nIf you wish for my name (and I should be glad that it should appear with\r\nthat of others in the same cause), could you not quote some sentence\r\nfrom my letter in the \"Times\" which I enclose, but please return it. If\r\nyou thought fit you might say you quoted it with my approval, and\r\nthat after still further reflection I still abide most strongly in my\r\nexpressed conviction.\r\n\r\nFor Heaven's sake, do think of this. I do not grudge the labour and\r\nthought; but I could write nothing worth any one reading.\r\n\r\nAllow me to demur to your calling your conjoint article a \"symposium\"\r\nstrictly a \"drinking party.\" This seems to me very bad taste, and I do\r\nhope every one of you will avoid any semblance of a joke on the subject.\r\nI KNOW that words, like a joke, on this subject have quite disgusted\r\nsome persons not at all inimical to physiology. One person lamented\r\nto me that Mr. Simon, in his truly admirable Address at the Medical\r\nCongress (by far the best thing which I have read), spoke of the\r\nfantastic SENSUALITY ('Transactions of the International Medical\r\nCongress,' 1881, volume iv. page 413. The expression \"lackadaisical\"\r\n(not fantastic), and \"feeble sensuality,\" are used with regard to the\r\nfeelings of the ant-vivisectionists.) (or some such term) of the many\r\nmistaken, but honest men and women who are half mad on the subject...\r\n\r\n[To Dr. Lauder Brunton my father wrote in February 1882:--\r\n\r\n\"Have you read Mr. [Edmund] Gurney's articles in the 'Fortnightly' (\"A\r\nchapter in the Ethics of Pain,\" 'Fortnightly Review,' 1881, volume xxx.\r\npage 778.) and 'Cornhill?' (\"An Epilogue on Vivisection,\" 'Cornhill\r\nMagazine,' 1882, volume xlv. page 191.) They seem to me very clever,\r\nthough obscurely written, and I agree with almost everything he says,\r\nexcept with some passages which appear to imply that no experiments\r\nshould be tried unless some immediate good can be predicted, and this is\r\na gigantic mistake contradicted by the whole history of science.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.IX. -- MISCELLANEA (continued)\r\n\r\nA REVIVAL OF GEOLOGICAL WORK--THE BOOK ON\r\nEARTHWORMS--LIFE OF ERASMUS DARWIN--MISCELLANEOUS LETTERS.\r\n\r\n1876-1882.\r\n\r\n[We have now to consider the work (other than botanical) which occupied\r\nthe concluding six years of my father's life. A letter to his old friend\r\nRev. L. Blomefield (Jenyns), written in March, 1877, shows what was my\r\nfather's estimate of his own powers of work at this time:--\r\n\r\n\"My dear Jenyns (I see I have forgotten your proper names).--Your\r\nextremely kind letter has given me warm pleasure. As one gets old, one's\r\nthoughts turn back to the past rather than to the future, and I often\r\nthink of the pleasant, and to me valuable, hours which I spent with you\r\non the borders of the Fens.\r\n\r\n\"You ask about my future work; I doubt whether I shall be able to do\r\nmuch more that is new, and I always keep before my mind the example\r\nof poor old --, who in his old age had a cacoethes for writing. But I\r\ncannot endure doing nothing, so I suppose that I shall go on as long as\r\nI can without obviously making a fool of myself. I have a great mass\r\nof matter with respect to variation under nature; but so much has been\r\npublished since the appearance of the 'Origin of Species,' that I very\r\nmuch doubt whether I retain power of mind and strength to reduce the\r\nmass into a digested whole. I have sometimes thought that I would try,\r\nbut dread the attempt...\"\r\n\r\nHis prophecy proved to be a true one with regard to any continuation\r\nof any general work in the direction of Evolution, but his estimate of\r\npowers which could afterwards prove capable of grappling with the 'Power\r\nof Movement in Plants,' and with the work on 'Earthworms,' was certainly\r\na low one.\r\n\r\nThe year 1876, with which the present chapter begins, brought with it\r\na revival of geological work. He had been astonished, as I hear from\r\nProfessor Judd, and as appears in his letters, to learn that his books\r\non 'Volcanic Islands,' 1844, and on 'South America,' 1846, were still\r\nconsulted by geologists, and it was a surprise to him that new editions\r\nshould be required. Both these works were originally published by\r\nMessrs. Smith and Elder, and the new edition of 1876 was also brought\r\nout by them. This appeared in one volume with the title 'Geological\r\nObservations on the Volcanic Islands, and Parts of South America visited\r\nduring the Voyage of H.M.S. \"Beagle\".' He has explained in the preface\r\nhis reasons for leaving untouched the text of the original editions:\r\n\"They relate to parts of the world which have been so rarely visited\r\nby men of science, that I am not aware that much could be corrected or\r\nadded from observations subsequently made. Owing to the great progress\r\nwhich Geology has made within recent times, my views on some few points\r\nmay be somewhat antiquated; but I have thought it best to leave them as\r\nthey originally appeared.\"\r\n\r\nIt may have been the revival of geological speculation, due to the\r\nrevision of his early books, that led to his recording the observations\r\nof which some account is given in the following letter. Part of it\r\nhas been published in Professor James Geikie's 'Prehistoric Europe,'\r\nchapters vii. and ix. (My father's suggestion is also noticed in Prof.\r\nGeikie's address on the 'Ice Age in Europe and North America,' given\r\nat Edinburgh, November 20, 1884.), a few verbal alterations having been\r\nmade at my father's request in the passages quoted. Mr. Geikie lately\r\nwrote to me: \"The views suggested in his letter as to the origin of the\r\nangular gravels, etc., in the South of England will, I believe, come to\r\nbe accepted as the truth. This question has a much wider bearing than\r\nmight at first appear. In point of fact it solves one of the most\r\ndifficult problems in Quaternary Geology--and has already attracted the\r\nattention of German geologists.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO JAMES GEIKIE. Down, November 16, 1876.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI hope that you will forgive me for troubling you with a very long\r\nletter. But first allow me to tell you with what extreme pleasure and\r\nadmiration I have just finished reading your 'Great Ice Age.' It seems\r\nto me admirably done, and most clear. Interesting as many chapters are\r\nin the history of the world, I do not think that any one comes [up]\r\nnearly to the glacial period or periods. Though I have steadily read\r\nmuch on the subject, your book makes the whole appear almost new to me.\r\n\r\nI am now going to mention a small observation, made by me two or three\r\nyears ago, near Southampton, but not followed out, as I have no strength\r\nfor excursions. I need say nothing about the character of the drift\r\nthere (which includes palaeolithic celts), for you have described its\r\nessential features in a few words at page 506. It covers the whole\r\ncountry [in an] even plain-like surface, almost irrespective of the\r\npresent outline of the land.\r\n\r\nThe coarse stratification has sometimes been disturbed. I find that you\r\nallude \"to the larger stones often standing on end;\" and this is the\r\npoint which struck me so much. Not only moderately sized angular stones,\r\nbut small oval pebbles often stand vertically up, in a manner which I\r\nhave never seen in ordinary gravel beds. This fact reminded me of what\r\noccurs near my home, in the stiff red clay, full of unworn flints over\r\nthe chalk, which is no doubt the residue left undissolved by rain\r\nwater. In this clay, flints as long and thin as my arm often stand\r\nperpendicularly up; and I have been told by the tank-diggers that it\r\nis their \"natural position!\" I presume that this position may safely be\r\nattributed to the differential movement of parts of the red clay as it\r\nsubsided very slowly from the dissolution of the underlying chalk; so\r\nthat the flints arrange themselves in the lines of least resistance. The\r\nsimilar but less strongly marked arrangement of the stones in the\r\ndrift near Southampton makes me suspect that it also must have\r\nslowly subsided; and the notion has crossed my mind that during the\r\ncommencement and height of the glacial period great beds of frozen snow\r\naccumulated over the south of England, and that, during the summer,\r\ngravel and stones were washed from the higher land over its surface, and\r\nin superficial channels. The larger streams may have cut right through\r\nthe frozen snow, and deposited gravel in lines at the bottom. But on\r\neach succeeding autumn, when the running water failed, I imagine that\r\nthe lines of drainage would have been filled up by blown snow afterwards\r\ncongealed, and that, owing to great surface accumulations of snow, it\r\nwould be a mere chance whether the drainage, together with gravel and\r\nsand, would follow the same lines during the next summer. Thus, as I\r\napprehend, alternate layers of frozen snow and drift, in sheets and\r\nlines, would ultimately have covered the country to a great thickness,\r\nwith lines of drift probably deposited in various directions at the\r\nbottom by the larger streams. As the climate became warmer, the lower\r\nbeds of frozen snow would have melted with extreme slowness, and the\r\nmany irregular beds of interstratified drift would have sunk down with\r\nequal slowness; and during this movement the elongated pebbles would\r\nhave arranged themselves more or less vertically. The drift would also\r\nhave been deposited almost irrespective of the outline of the underlying\r\nland. When I viewed the country I could not persuade myself that any\r\nflood, however great, could have deposited such coarse gravel over the\r\nalmost level platforms between the valleys. My view differs from that\r\nof Holst, page 415 ['Great Ice Age'], of which I had never heard, as\r\nhis relates to channels cut through glaciers, and mine to beds of drift\r\ninterstratified with frozen snow where no glaciers existed. The upshot\r\nof this long letter is to ask you to keep my notion in your head,\r\nand look out for upright pebbles in any lowland country which you may\r\nexamine, where glaciers have not existed. Or if you think the notion\r\ndeserves any further thought, but not otherwise, to tell any one of\r\nit, for instance Mr. Skertchly, who is examining such districts. Pray\r\nforgive me for writing so long a letter, and again thanking you for the\r\ngreat pleasure derived from your book,\r\n\r\nI remain yours very faithfully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.... I am glad that you have read Blytt (Axel Blytt.--'Essay on\r\nthe Immigration of the Norwegian Flora during alternate rainy and dry\r\nSeasons.' Christiania, 1876.); his paper seemed to me a most important\r\ncontribution to Botanical Geography. How curious that the same\r\nconclusions should have been arrived at by Mr. Skertchly, who seems to\r\nbe a first-rate observer; and this implies, as I always think, a sound\r\ntheoriser.\r\n\r\nI have told my publisher to send you in two or three days a copy (second\r\nedition) of my geological work during the voyage of the \"Beagle\". The\r\nsole point which would perhaps interest you is about the steppe-like\r\nplains of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nFor many years past I have had fearful misgivings that it must have been\r\nthe level of the sea, and not that of the land which has changed.\r\n\r\nI read a few months ago your [brother's] very interesting life of\r\nMurchison. (By Mr. Archibald Geikie.) Though I have always thought that\r\nhe ranked next to W. Smith in the classification of formations, and\r\nthough I knew how kind-hearted [he was], yet the book has raised him\r\ngreatly in my respect, notwithstanding his foibles and want of broad\r\nphilosophical views.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The only other geological work of his later years was embodied in\r\nhis book on earthworms (1881), which may therefore be conveniently\r\nconsidered in this place. This subject was one which had interested him\r\nmany years before this date, and in 1838 a paper on the formation of\r\nmould was published in the Proceedings of the Geological Society (see\r\nvolume i.).\r\n\r\nHere he showed that \"fragments of burnt marl, cinders, etc., which had\r\nbeen thickly strewed over the surface of several meadows were found\r\nafter a few years lying at a depth of some inches beneath the turf, but\r\nstill forming a layer.\" For the explanation of this fact, which forms\r\nthe central idea of the geological part of the book, he was indebted to\r\nhis uncle Josiah Wedgwood, who suggested that worms, by bringing earth\r\nto the surface in their castings, must undermine any objects lying on\r\nthe surface and cause an apparent sinking.\r\n\r\nIn the book of 1881 he extended his observations on this burying action,\r\nand devised a number of different ways of checking his estimates as to\r\nthe amount of work done. (He received much valuable help from Dr. King,\r\nof the Botanical Gardens, Calcutta. The following passage is from a\r\nletter to Dr. King, dated January 18, 1873:--\r\n\r\n\"I really do not know how to thank you enough for the immense trouble\r\nwhich you have taken. You have attended EXACTLY and FULLY to the points\r\nabout which I was most anxious. If I had been each evening by your side,\r\nI could not have suggested anything else.\") He also added a mass of\r\nobservations on the habits, natural history and intelligence of worms, a\r\npart of the work which added greatly to its popularity.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Sir Thomas Farrer had discovered close to his garden the remains\r\nof a building of Roman-British times, and thus gave my father the\r\nopportunity of seeing for himself the effects produced by earthworms'\r\nwork on the old concrete-floors, walls, etc. On his return he wrote to\r\nSir Thomas Farrer:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot remember a more delightful week than the last. I know very\r\nwell that E. will not believe me, but the worms were by no means the\r\nsole charm.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1880, when the 'Power of Movement in Plants' was nearly\r\nfinished, he began once more on the subject. He wrote to Professor Carus\r\n(September 21):--\r\n\r\n\"In the intervals of correcting the press, I am writing a very little\r\nbook, and have done nearly half of it. Its title will be (as at present\r\ndesigned) 'The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of\r\nWorms.' (The full title is 'The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the\r\nAction of Worms with Observations on their Habits,' 1881.) As far as I\r\ncan judge it will be a curious little book.\"\r\n\r\nThe manuscript was sent to the printers in April, 1881, and when the\r\nproo-sheets were coming in he wrote to Professor Carus: \"The subject\r\nhas been to me a hobby-horse, and I have perhaps treated it in foolish\r\ndetail.\"\r\n\r\nIt was published on October 10, and 2000 copies were sold at once. He\r\nwrote to Sir J.D. Hooker, \"I am glad that you approve of the 'Worms.'\r\nWhen in old days I used to tell you whatever I was doing, if you were at\r\nall interested, I always felt as most men do when their work is finally\r\npublished.\"\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Mellard Reade he wrote (November 8): \"It has been a complete\r\nsurprise to me how many persons have cared for the subject.\" And to Mr.\r\nDyer (in November): \"My book has been received with almost laughable\r\nenthusiasm, and 3500 copies have been sold!!!\" Again, to his friend Mr.\r\nAnthony Rich, he wrote on February 4, 1882, \"I have been plagued with an\r\nendless stream of letters on the subject; most of them very foolish\r\nand enthusiastic; but some containing good facts which I have used in\r\ncorrecting yesterday the 'Sixth Thousand.'\" The popularity of the book\r\nmay be roughly estimated by the fact that, in the three years following\r\nits publication, 8500 copies were sold--a sale relatively greater than\r\nthat of the 'Origin of Species.'\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to account for its success with the non-scientific\r\npublic. Conclusions so wide and so novel, and so easily understood,\r\ndrawn from the study of creatures so familiar, and treated with unabated\r\nvigour and freshness, may well have attracted many readers. A reviewer\r\nremarks: \"In the eyes of most men... the earthworm is a mere blind, dumb,\r\nsenseless, and unpleasantly slimy annelid. Mr. Darwin undertakes to\r\nrehabilitate his character, and the earthworm steps forth at once as\r\nan intelligent and beneficent personage, a worker of vast geological\r\nchanges, a planer down of mountain sides... a friend of man... and an\r\nally of the Society for the preservation of ancient monuments.\" The \"St.\r\nJames Gazette\", October 17, 1881, pointed out that the teaching of the\r\ncumulative importance of the infinitely little is the point of contact\r\nbetween this book and the author's previous work.\r\n\r\nOne more book remains to be noticed, the 'Life of Erasmus Darwin.'\r\n\r\nIn February 1879 an essay by Dr. Ernst Krause, on the scientific work\r\nof Erasmus Darwin, appeared in the evolutionary journal, 'Kosmos.' The\r\nnumber of 'Kosmos' in question was a \"Gratulationsheft\" (The same number\r\ncontains a good biographical sketch of my father, of which the material\r\nwas to a large extent supplied by him to the writer, Professor Preyer\r\nof Jena. The article contains an excellent list of my father's\r\npublications.), or special congratulatory issue in honour of my father's\r\nbirthday, so that Dr. Krause's essay, glorifying the older evolutionist,\r\nwas quite in its place. He wrote to Dr. Krause, thanking him cordially\r\nfor the honour paid to Erasmus, and asking his permission to publish\r\n(The wish to do so was shared by his brother, Erasmus Darwin the\r\nyounger, who continued to be associated with the project.) an English\r\ntranslation of the Essay.\r\n\r\nHis chief reason for writing a notice of his grandfather's life was \"to\r\ncontradict flatly some calumnies by Miss Seward.\" This appears from a\r\nletter of March 27, 1879, to his cousin Reginald Darwin, in which\r\nhe asks for any documents and letters which might throw light on the\r\ncharacter of Erasmus. This led to Mr. Reginald Darwin placing in my\r\nfather's hands a quantity of valuable material, including a curious\r\nfolio common-place book, of which he wrote: \"I have been deeply\r\ninterested by the great book,... reading and looking at it is like having\r\ncommunion with the dead...[it] has taught me a good deal about the\r\noccupations and tastes of our grandfather.\" A subsequent letter (April\r\n8) to the same correspondent describes the source of a further supply of\r\nmaterial:--\r\n\r\nSince my last letter I have made a strange discovery; for an old box\r\nfrom my father marked \"Old Deeds,\" and which consequently I had never\r\nopened, I found full of letters--hundreds from Dr. Erasmus--and others\r\nfrom old members of the Family: some few very curious. Also a drawing of\r\nElston before it was altered, about 1750, of which I think I will give a\r\ncopy.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Krause's contribution formed the second part of the 'Life of Erasmus\r\nDarwin,' my father supplying a \"preliminary notice.\" This expression on\r\nthe title-page is somewhat misleading; my father's contribution is more\r\nthan half the book, and should have been described as a biography. Work\r\nof this kind was new to him, and he wrote doubtfully to Mr. Thiselton\r\nDyer, June 18th: \"God only knows what I shall make of his life, it is\r\nsuch a new kind of work to me.\" The strong interest he felt about\r\nhis forebears helped to give zest to the work, which became a decided\r\nenjoyment to him. With the general public the book was not markedly\r\nsuccessful, but many of his friends recognised its merits. Sir J.D.\r\nHooker was one of these, and to him my father wrote, \"Your praise of the\r\nLife of Dr. D. has pleased me exceedingly, for I despised my work, and\r\nthought myself a perfect fool to have undertaken such a job.\"\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Galton, too, he wrote, November 14:--\r\n\r\n\"I am EXTREMELY glad that you approve of the little 'Life' of our\r\ngrandfather, for I have been repenting that I ever undertook it, as the\r\nwork was quite beyond my tether.\"\r\n\r\nThe publication of the 'Life of Erasmus Darwin' led to an attack by\r\nMr. Samuel Butler, which amounted to a charge of falsehood against my\r\nfather. After consulting his friends, he came to the determination to\r\nleave the charge unanswered, as unworthy of his notice. (He had, in a\r\nletter to Mr. Butler, expressed his regret at the oversight which caused\r\nso much offence.) Those who wish to know more of the matter, may gather\r\nthe facts of the case from Ernst Krause's 'Charles Darwin,' and they\r\nwill find Mr. Butler's statement of his grievance in the \"Athenaeum\",\r\nJanuary 31, 1880, and in the \"St. James's Gazette\", December 8, 1880.\r\nThe affair gave my father much pain, but the warm sympathy of those\r\nwhose opinion he respected soon helped him to let it pass into a\r\nwell-merited oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe following letter refers to M. J.H. Fabre's 'Souvenirs\r\nEntomologiques.' It may find a place here, as it contains a defence of\r\nErasmus Darwin on a small point. The postscript is interesting, as\r\nan example of one of my father's bold ideas both as to experiment and\r\ntheory:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.H. FABRE. Down, January 31, 1880.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI hope that you will permit me to have the satisfaction of thanking you\r\ncordially for the lively pleasure which I have derived from reading\r\nyour book. Never have the wonderful habits of insects been more vividly\r\ndescribed, and it is almost as good to read about them as to see them. I\r\nfeel sure that you would not be unjust to even an insect, much less to\r\na man. Now, you have been misled by some translator, for my grandfather,\r\nErasmus Darwin, states ('Zoonomia,' volume i. page 183, 1794) that it\r\nwas a wasp (guepe) which he saw cutting off the wings of a large fly. I\r\nhave no doubt that you are right in saying that the wings are generally\r\ncut off instinctively; but in the case described by my grandfather, the\r\nwasp, after cutting off the two ends of the body, rose in the air, and\r\nwas turned round by the wind; he then alighted and cut off the wings. I\r\nmust believe, with Pierre Huber, that insects have \"une petite dose de\r\nraison.\" In the next edition of your book, I hope that you will alter\r\nPART of what you say about my grandfather.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that you are so strongly opposed to the Descent theory; I\r\nhave found the searching for the history of each structure or instinct\r\nan excellent aid to observation; and wonderful observer as you are, it\r\nwould suggest new points to you. If I were to write on the evolution of\r\ninstincts, I could make good use of some of the facts which you give.\r\nPermit me to add, that when I read the last sentence in your book, I\r\nsympathised deeply with you. (The book is intended as a memorial of the\r\nearly death of M. Fabre's son, who had been his father's assistant in\r\nhis observations on insect life.)\r\n\r\nWith the most sincere respect, I remain, dear Sir, yours faithfully,\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Allow me to make a suggestion in relation to your wonderful\r\naccount of insects finding their way home. I formerly wished to try it\r\nwith pigeons: namely, to carry the insects in their paper \"cornets,\"\r\nabout a hundred paces in the opposite direction to that which you\r\nultimately intended to carry them; but before turning round to return,\r\nto put the insect in a circular box, with an axle which could be made to\r\nrevolve very rapidly, first in one direction, and then in another, so\r\nas to destroy for a time all sense of direction in the insects. I have\r\nsometimes IMAGINED that animals may feel in which direction they were at\r\nthe first start carried. (This idea was a favourite one with him, and he\r\nhas described in 'Nature' (volume vii. 1873, page 360) the behaviour of\r\nhis cob Tommy, in whom he fancied he detected a sense of direction. The\r\nhorse had been taken by rail from Kent to the Isle of Wight; when there\r\nhe exhibited a marked desire to go eastward, even when his stable lay in\r\nthe opposite direction. In the same volume of 'Nature,' page 417, is\r\na letter on the 'Origin of Certain Instincts,' which contains a short\r\ndiscussion on the sense of direction.) If this plan failed, I had\r\nintended placing the pigeons within an induction coil, so as to disturb\r\nany magnetic or dia-magnetic sensibility, which it seems just possible\r\nthat they may possess.\r\n\r\nC.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[During the latter years of my father's life there was a growing\r\ntendency in the public to do him honour. In 1877 he received the\r\nhonorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Cambridge. The degree\r\nwas conferred on November 17, and with the customary Latin speech\r\nfrom the Public Orator, concluding with the words: \"Tu vero, qui leges\r\nnaturae tam docte illustraveris, legum doctor nobis esto.\"\r\n\r\nThe honorary degree led to a movement being set on foot in the\r\nUniversity to obtain some permanent memorial of my father. A sum of\r\nabout 400 pounds was subscribed, and after the rejection of the idea\r\nthat a bust would be the best memorial, a picture was determined on. In\r\nJune 1879 he sat to Mr. W. Richmond for the portrait in the possession\r\nof the University, now placed in the Library of the philosophical\r\nSociety at Cambridge. He is represented seated in his Doctor's gown, the\r\nhead turned towards the spectator: the picture has many admirers, but,\r\naccording to my own view, neither the attitude nor the expression are\r\ncharacteristic of my father.\r\n\r\nA similar wish on the part of the Linnean Society-- with which my father\r\nwas so closely associated--led to his sitting in August, 1881, to Mr.\r\nJohn Collier, for the portrait now in the possession of the Society.\r\nOf the artist, he wrote, \"Collier was the most considerate, kind and\r\npleasant painter a sitter could desire.\" The portrait represents him\r\nstanding facing the observer in the loose cloak so familiar to those who\r\nknew him, and with his slouch hat in his hand. Many of those who knew\r\nhis face most intimately, think that Mr. Collier's picture is the best\r\nof the portraits, and in this judgment the sitter himself was inclined\r\nto agree. According to my feeling it is not so simple or strong a\r\nrepresentation of him as that given by Mr. Ouless. There is a certain\r\nexpression in Mr. Collier's portrait which I am inclined to consider an\r\nexaggeration of the almost painful expression which Professor Cohn has\r\ndescribed in my father's face, and which he had previously noticed in\r\nHumboldt. Professor Cohn's remarks occur in a pleasantly written account\r\nof a visit to Down in 1876, published in the \"Breslauer Zeitung\", April\r\n23, 1882. (In this connection may be mentioned a visit (1881) from\r\nanother distinguished German, Hans Richter. The occurrence is otherwise\r\nworthy of mention, inasmuch as it led to the publication, after my\r\nfather's death, of Herr Richter's recollections of the visit. The sketch\r\nis simply and sympathetically written, and the author has succeeded in\r\ngiving a true picture of my father as he lived at Down. It appeared in\r\nthe \"Neue Tagblatt\" of Vienna, and was republished by Dr. O. Zacharias\r\nin his 'Charles R. Darwin,' Berlin, 1882.)\r\n\r\nBesides the Cambridge degree, he received about the same time honours of\r\nan academic kind from some foreign societies.\r\n\r\nOn August 5, 1878, he was elected a Corresponding Member of the French\r\nInstitute (\"Lyell always spoke of it as a great scandal that Darwin\r\nwas so long kept out of the French Institute. As he said, even if the\r\ndevelopment hypothesis were objected to, Darwin's original works on\r\nCoral Reefs, the Cirripedia, and other subjects, constituted a more\r\nthan sufficient claim\"--From Professor Judd's notes.), in the Botanical\r\nSection, and wrote to Dr. Asa Gray:--\r\n\r\n\"I see that we are both elected Corresponding Members of the Institute.\r\nIt is rather a good joke that I should be elected in the Botanical\r\nSection, as the extent of my knowledge is little more than that a daisy\r\nis a Compositous plant and a pea a Leguminous one.\"\r\n\r\n(The statement has been more than once published that he was elected to\r\nthe Zoological Section, but this was not the case.\r\n\r\nHe received twenty-six votes out of a possible 39, five blank papers\r\nwere sent in, and eight votes were recorded for the other candidates.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 an attempt had been made to elect him to the Section of Zoology,\r\nwhen, however, he only received 15 out of 48 votes, and Loven was chosen\r\nfor the vacant place. It appears ('Nature,' August 1, 1872) that an\r\neminent member of the Academy wrote to \"Les Mondes\" to the following\r\neffect:--\r\n\r\n\"What has closed the doors of the Academy to Mr. Darwin is that the\r\nscience of those of his books which have made his chief title to\r\nfame-the 'Origin of Species,' and still more the 'Descent of Man,'\r\nis not science, but a mass of assertions and absolutely gratuitous\r\nhypotheses, often evidently fallacious. This kind of publication and\r\nthese theories are a bad example, which a body that respects itself\r\ncannot encourage.\")\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the same year he was elected a Corresponding Member\r\nof the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and he wrote (March 12) to Professor\r\nDu Bois Reymond, who had proposed him for election:--\r\n\r\n\"I thank you sincerely for your most kind letter, in which you announce\r\nthe great honour conferred on me. The knowledge of the names of the\r\nillustrious men, who seconded the proposal is even a greater pleasure to\r\nme than the honour itself.\"\r\n\r\nThe seconders were Helmholtz, Peters, Ewald, Pringsheim and Virchow.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 he received the Baly Medal of the Royal College of Physicians.\r\n(The visit to London, necessitated by the presentation of the Baly\r\nMedal, was combined with a visit to Miss Forster's house at Abinger,\r\nin Surrey, and this was the occasion of the following characteristic\r\nletter:--\"I must write a few words to thank you cordially for lending us\r\nyour house. It was a most kind thought, and has pleased me greatly; but\r\nI know well that I do not deserve such kindness from any one. On the\r\nother hand, no one can be too kind to my dear wife, who is worth her\r\nweight in gold many times over, and she was anxious that I should\r\nget some complete rest, and here I cannot rest. Your house will be a\r\ndelightful haven and again I thank you truly.\")\r\n\r\nAgain in 1879 he received from the Royal Academy of Turin the \"Bressa\"\r\nprize for the years 1875-78, amounting to the sum of 12,000 francs.\r\nIn the following year he received on his birthday, as on previous\r\noccasions, a kind letter of congratulation from Dr. Dohrn of Naples. In\r\nwriting (February 15th) to thank him and the other naturalists at the\r\nZoological Station, my father added:--\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you saw in the papers that the Turin Society honoured me to an\r\nextraordinary degree by awarding me the \"Bressa\" Prize. Now it occurred\r\nto me that if your station wanted some pieces of apparatus, of about the\r\nvalue of 100 pounds, I should very much like to be allowed to pay for\r\nit. Will you be so kind as to keep this in mind, and if any want should\r\noccur to you, I would send you a cheque at any time.\"\r\n\r\nI find from my father's accounts that 100 pounds was presented to the\r\nNaples Station.\r\n\r\nHe received also several tokens of respect and sympathy of a more\r\nprivate character from various sources. With regard to such incidents\r\nand to the estimation of the public generally, his attitude may be\r\nillustrated by a passage from a letter to Mr. Romanes:--(The lecture\r\nreferred to was given at the Dublin meeting of the British association.)\r\n\r\n\"You have indeed passed a most magnificent eulogium upon me, and I\r\nwonder that you were not afraid of hearing 'oh! oh!' or some other sign\r\nof disapprobation. Many persons think that what I have done in science\r\nhas been much overrated, and I very often think so myself; but my\r\ncomfort is that I have never consciously done anything to gain applause.\r\nEnough and too much about my dear self.\"\r\n\r\nAmong such expressions of regard he valued very highly the two\r\nphotographic albums received from Germany and Holland on his birthday,\r\n1877. Herr Emil Rade of Munster, originated the idea of the German\r\nbirthday gift, and undertook the necessary arrangements. To him my\r\nfather wrote (February 16, 1877):--\r\n\r\n\"I hope that you will inform the one hundred and fifty-four men of\r\nscience, including some of the most highly honoured names in the world,\r\nhow grateful I am for their kindness and generous sympathy in having\r\nsent me their photographs on my birthday.\"\r\n\r\nTo Professor Haeckel he wrote (February 16, 1877):--\r\n\r\nThe album has just arrived quite safe. It is most superb. (The album is\r\nmagnificently bound and decorated with a beautifully illuminated\r\ntitle page, the work of an artist, Herr A. Fitger of Bremen, who also\r\ncontributed the dedicatory poem.) It is by far the greatest honour which\r\nI have ever received, and my satisfaction has been greatly enhanced by\r\nyour most kind letter of February 9... I thank you all from my heart.\r\nI have written by this post to Herr Rade, and I hope he will somehow\r\nmanage to thank all my generous friends.\"\r\n\r\nTo Professor A. van Bemmelen he wrote, on receiving a similar present\r\nfrom a number of distinguished men and lovers of Natural History in the\r\nNetherlands:--\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\nI received yesterday the magnificent present of the album, together\r\nwith your letter. I hope that you will endeavour to find some means to\r\nexpress to the two hundred and seventeen distinguished observers and\r\nlovers of natural science, who have sent me their photographs, my\r\ngratitude for their extreme kindness. I feel deeply gratified by this\r\ngift, and I do not think that any testimonial more honourable to me\r\ncould have been imagined. I am well aware that my books could never have\r\nbeen written, and would not have made any impression on the public mind,\r\nhad not an immense amount of material been collected by a long series\r\nof admirable observers; and it is to them that honour is chiefly due. I\r\nsuppose that every worker at science occasionally feels depressed, and\r\ndoubts whether what he has published has been worth the labour which\r\nit has cost him, but for the few remaining years of my life, whenever\r\nI want cheering, I will look at the portraits of my distinguished\r\nco-workers in the field of science, and remember their generous\r\nsympathy. When I die, the album will be a most precious bequest to my\r\nchildren. I must further express my obligation for the very interesting\r\nhistory contained in your letter of the progress of opinion in the\r\nNetherlands, with respect to Evolution, the whole of which is quite new\r\nto me. I must again thank all my kind friends, from my heart, for their\r\never-memorable testimonial, and I remain, Sir,\r\n\r\nYour obliged and grateful servant, CHARLES R. DARWIN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the June of the following year (1878) he was gratified by learning\r\nthat the Emperor of Brazil had expressed a wish to meet him. Owing to\r\nabsence from home my father was unable to comply with this wish; he\r\nwrote to Sir J.D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"The Emperor has done so much for science, that every scientific man is\r\nbound to show him the utmost respect, and I hope that you will express\r\nin the strongest language, and which you can do with entire truth, how\r\ngreatly I feel honoured by his wish to see me; and how much I regret my\r\nabsence from home.\"\r\n\r\nFinally it should be mentioned that in 1880 he received an address\r\npersonally presented by members of the Council of the Birmingham\r\nPhilosophical Society, as well as a memorial from the Yorkshire\r\nNaturalist Union presented by some of the members, headed by Dr. Sorby.\r\nHe also received in the same year a visit from some of the members of\r\nthe Lewisham and Blackheath Scientific Association,--a visit which was,\r\nI think, enjoyed by both guests and host.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS LETTERS--1876-1882.\r\n\r\n[The chief incident of a personal kind (not already dealt with) in the\r\nyears which we are now considering was the death of his brother Erasmus,\r\nwho died at his house in Queen Anne Street, on August 26th, 1881. My\r\nfather wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker (August 30):--\r\n\r\n\"The death of Erasmus is a very heavy loss to all of us, for he had\r\na most affectionate disposition. He always appeared to me the most\r\npleasant and clearest headed man, whom I have ever known. London will\r\nseem a strange place to me without his presence; I am deeply glad that\r\nhe died without any great suffering, after a very short illness from\r\nmere weakness and not from any definite disease. (\"He was not, I\r\nthink, a happy man, and for many years did not value life, though never\r\ncomplaining.\"--From a letter to Sir Thomas Farrer.)\r\n\r\n\"I cannot quite agree with you about the death of the old and young.\r\nDeath in the latter case, when there is a bright future ahead, causes\r\ngrief never to be wholly obliterated.\"\r\n\r\nAn incident of a happy character may also be selected for especial\r\nnotice, since it was one which strongly moved my father's sympathy.\r\nA letter (December 17, 1879) to Sir Joseph Hooker shows that the\r\npossibility of a Government Pension being conferred on Mr. Wallace first\r\noccurred to my father at this time. The idea was taken up by others, and\r\nmy father's letters show that he felt the most lively interest in the\r\nsuccess of the plan. He wrote, for instance, to Mrs. Fisher, \"I hardly\r\never wished for anything more than I do for the success of our plan.\" He\r\nwas deeply pleased when this thoroughly deserved honour was bestowed on\r\nhis friend, and wrote to the same correspondent (January 7, 1881),\r\non receiving a letter from Mr. Gladstone announcing the fact: \"How\r\nextraordinarily kind of Mr. Gladstone to find time to write under the\r\npresent circumstances. (Mr. Gladstone was then in office, and the letter\r\nmust have been written when he was overwhelmed with business connected\r\nwith the opening of Parliament (January 6). Good heavens! how pleased I\r\nam!\"\r\n\r\nThe letters which follow are of a miscellaneous character and refer\r\nprincipally to the books he read, and to his minor writings.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MISS BUCKLEY (MRS. FISHER). Down, February 11 [1876].\r\n\r\nMy dear Miss Buckley,\r\n\r\nYou must let me have the pleasure of saying that I have just finished\r\nreading with very great interest your new book. ('A Short History of\r\nNatural Science.') The idea seems to me a capital one, and as far as I\r\ncan judge very well carried out. There is much fascination in taking\r\na bird's eye view of all the grand leading steps in the progress of\r\nscience. At first I regretted that you had not kept each science more\r\nseparate; but I dare say you found it impossible. I have hardly any\r\ncriticisms, except that I think you ought to have introduced Murchison\r\nas a great classifier of formations, second only to W. Smith. You have\r\ndone full justice, and not more than justice, to our dear old master,\r\nLyell. Perhaps a little more ought to have been said about botany, and\r\nif you should ever add this, you would find Sachs' 'History,' lately\r\npublished, very good for your purpose.\r\n\r\nYou have crowned Wallace and myself with much honour and glory. I\r\nheartily congratulate you on having produced so novel and interesting a\r\nwork, and remain,\r\n\r\nMy dear Miss Buckley, yours very faithfully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. [Hopedene] (Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood's\r\nhouse in Surrey.), June 5, 1876.\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace,\r\n\r\nI must have the pleasure of expressing to you my unbounded admiration of\r\nyour book ('Geographical Distribution,' 1876.), though I have read only\r\nto page 184--my object having been to do as little as possible while\r\nresting. I feel sure that you have laid a broad and safe foundation\r\nfor all future work on Distribution. How interesting it will be to see\r\nhereafter plants treated in strict relation to your views; and then all\r\ninsects, pulmonate molluscs and fresh-water fishes, in greater detail\r\nthan I suppose you have given to these lower animals. The point which\r\nhas interested me most, but I do not say the most valuable point, is\r\nyour protest against sinking imaginary continents in a quite reckless\r\nmanner, as was stated by Forbes, followed, alas, by Hooker, and\r\ncaricatured by Wollaston and [Andrew] Murray! By the way, the main\r\nimpression that the latter author has left on my mind is his utter want\r\nof all scientific judgment. I have lifted up my voice against the above\r\nview with no avail, but I have no doubt that you will succeed, owing\r\nto your new arguments and the coloured chart. Of a special value, as it\r\nseems to me, is the conclusion that we must determine the areas, chiefly\r\nby the nature of the mammals. When I worked many years ago on this\r\nsubject, I doubted much whether the now called Palaearctic and Nearctic\r\nregions ought to be separated; and I determined if I made another region\r\nthat it should be Madagascar. I have, therefore, been able to appreciate\r\nyour evidence on these points. What progress Palaeontology has made\r\nduring the last 20 years; but if it advances at the same rate in the\r\nfuture, our views on the migration and birth-place of the various groups\r\nwill, I fear, be greatly altered. I cannot feel quite easy about the\r\nGlacial period, and the extinction of large mammals, but I must hope\r\nthat you are right. I think you will have to modify your belief about\r\nthe difficulty of dispersal of land molluscs; I was interrupted when\r\nbeginning to experimentize on the just hatched young adhering to the\r\nfeet of groun-roosting birds. I differ on one other point, viz. in the\r\nbelief that there must have existed a Tertiary Antarctic continent, from\r\nwhich various forms radiated to the southern extremities of our present\r\ncontinents. But I could go on scribbling forever. You have written, as\r\nI believe, a grand and memorable work which will last for years as the\r\nfoundation for all future treatises on Geographical Distribution.\r\n\r\nMy dear Wallace, yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--You have paid me the highest conceivable compliment, by what\r\nyou say of your work in relation to my chapters on distribution in the\r\n'Origin,' and I heartily thank you for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letters illustrate my father's power of taking a vivid\r\ninterest in work bearing on Evolution, but unconnected with his own\r\nspecial researches at the time. The books referred to in the first\r\nletter are Professor Weismann's 'Studien zur Descendenzlehre' (My father\r\ncontributed a prefatory note to Mr. Meldola's translation of Prof.\r\nWeismann's 'Studien,' 1880-81.), being part of the series of essays\r\nby which the author has done such admirable service to the cause of\r\nevolution:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO AUGUST WEISMANN. January 12, 1877.\r\n\r\n... I read German so slowly, and have had lately to read several other\r\npapers, so that I have as yet finished only half of your first essay and\r\ntwo-thirds of your second. They have excited my interest and admiration\r\nin the highest degree, and whichever I think of last, seems to me\r\nthe most valuable. I never expected to see the coloured marks on\r\ncaterpillars so well explained; and the case of the ocelli delights me\r\nespecially...\r\n\r\n... There is one other subject which has always seemed to me more\r\ndifficult to explain than even the colours of caterpillars, and that is\r\nthe colour of birds' eggs, and I wish you would take this up.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MELCHIOR NEUMAYR (Professor of Palaeontology at\r\nVienna.), VIENNA. Down, Beckenham, Kent, March 9, 1877.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nFrom having been obliged to read other books, I finished only\r\nyesterday your essay on 'Die Congerien,' etc. ('Die Congerien und\r\nPaludinenschichten Slavoneins.' 4to, 1875.)\r\n\r\nI hope that you will allow me to express my gratitude for the pleasure\r\nand instruction which I have derived from reading it. It seems to me to\r\nbe an admirable work; and is by far the best case which I have ever\r\nmet with, showing the direct influence of the conditions of life on the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nMr. Hyatt, who has been studying the Hilgendorf case, writes to me with\r\nrespect to the conclusions at which he has arrived, and these are nearly\r\nthe same as yours. He insists that closely similar forms may be derived\r\nfrom distinct lines of descent; and this is what I formerly called\r\nanalogical variation. There can now be no doubt that species may become\r\ngreatly modified through the direct action of the environment. I have\r\nsome excuse for not having formerly insisted more strongly on this head\r\nin my 'Origin of Species,' as most of the best facts have been observed\r\nsince its publication.\r\n\r\nWith my renewed thanks for your most interesting essay, and with the\r\nhighest respect, I remain, dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO E.S. MORSE. Down, April 23, 1877.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYou must allow me just to tell you how very much I have been interested\r\nwith the excellent Address (\"What American Zoologists have done for\r\nEvolution,\" an Address to the American Association for the Advancement\r\nof Science, August, 1876. Volume xxv. of the Proceedings of the\r\nAssociation.) which you have been so kind as to send me, and which I had\r\nmuch wished to read. I believe that I had read all, or very nearly all,\r\nthe papers by your countrymen to which you refer, but I have been fairly\r\nastonished at their number and importance when seeing them thus put\r\ntogether. I quite agree about the high value of Mr. Allen's works\r\n(Mr. J.A. Allen shows the existence of geographical races of birds and\r\nmammals. Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist. volume xv.), as showing how much\r\nchange may be expected apparently through the direct action of the\r\nconditions of life. As for the fossil remains in the West, no words will\r\nexpress how wonderful they are. There is one point which I regret that\r\nyou did not make clear in your Address, namely what is the meaning and\r\nimportance of Professors Cope and Hyatt's views on acceleration and\r\nretardation. I have endeavoured, and given up in despair, the attempt to\r\ngrasp their meaning.\r\n\r\nPermit me to thank you cordially for the kind feeling shown towards me\r\nthrough your Address, and I remain, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours faithfully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The next letter refers to his 'Biographical Sketch of an Infant,'\r\nwritten from notes made 37 years previously, and published in 'Mind,'\r\nJuly, 1877. The article attracted a good deal of attention, and was\r\ntranslated at the time in 'Kosmos,' and the 'Revue Scientifique,'\r\nand has been recently published in Dr. Krause's 'Gesammelte kleinere\r\nSchrifteN von Charles Darwin,' 1887:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO G.

If you do not think it fit, as\r\nis very likely, will you please to return it to me. I hope that you will\r\nread it in an extra critical spirit, as I cannot judge whether it is\r\nworth publishing from having been so much interested in watching the\r\ndawn of the several faculties in my own infant. I may add that I should\r\nnever have thought of sending you the MS., had not M. Taine's article\r\nappeared in your Journal. (1877, page 252. The original appeared in the\r\n'Revue Philosophique' 1876.) If my MS. is printed, I think that I had\r\nbetter see a proof.\r\n\r\nI remain, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The two following extracts show the lively interest he preserved in\r\ndiverse fields of enquiry. Professor Cohn of Breslau had mentioned, in\r\na letter, Koch's researches on Splenic Fever, my father replied, January\r\n3:--\r\n\r\n\"I well remember saying to myself, between twenty and thirty years ago,\r\nthat if ever the origin of any infectious disease could be proved, it\r\nwould be the greatest triumph to science; and now I rejoice to have seen\r\nthe triumph.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring he received a copy of Dr. E. von Mojsisovics' 'Dolomit\r\nRiffe,' his letter to the author (June 1, 1878) is interesting as\r\nbearing on the influence of his own work on the methods of geology.\r\n\r\n\"I have at last found time to read the first chapter of your 'Dolomit\r\nRiffe,' and have been EXCEEDINGLY interested by it. What a wonderful\r\nchange in the future of Geological chronology you indicate, by assuming\r\nthe descent theory to be established, and then taking the graduated\r\nchanges of the same group of organisms as the true standard! I never\r\nhoped to live to see such a step even proposed by any one.\"\r\n\r\nAnother geological research which roused my father's admiration was Mr.\r\nD. Mackintosh's work on erratic blocks. Apart from its intrinsic merit\r\nthe work keenly excited his sympathy from the conditions under which it\r\nwas executed, Mr. Mackintosh being compelled to give nearly his\r\nwhole time to tuition. The following passage is from a letter to Mr.\r\nMackintosh of October 9, 1879, and refers to his paper in the Journal of\r\nthe Geological Society, 1878:--\r\n\r\n\"I hope that you will allow me to have the pleasure of thanking you\r\nfor the very great pleasure which I have derived from just reading your\r\npaper on erratic blocks. The map is wonderful, and what labour each\r\nof those lines show!

Mag. xxi. 1842.) between flat or planed scored\r\nrocks, and mammillated scored rocks.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. RIDLEY. Down, November 28, 1878.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI just skimmed through Dr. Pusey's sermon, as published in the\r\n\"Guardian\", but it did [not] seem to me worthy of any attention. As I\r\nhave never answered criticisms excepting those made by scientific men,\r\nI am not willing that this letter should be published; but I have no\r\nobjection to your saying that you sent me the three questions, and that\r\nI answered that Dr. Pusey was mistaken in imagining that I wrote the\r\n'Origin' with any relation whatever to Theology. I should have thought\r\nthat this would have been evident to any one who had taken the trouble\r\nto read the book, more especially as in the opening lines of the\r\nintroduction I specify how the subject arose in my mind. This answer\r\ndisposes of your two other questions; but I may add that many years\r\nago, when I was collecting facts for the 'Origin,' my belief in what is\r\ncalled a personal God was as firm as that of Dr. Pusey himself, and\r\nas to the eternity of matter I have never troubled myself about such\r\ninsoluble questions. Dr. Pusey's attack will be as powerless to retard\r\nby a day the belief in Evolution, as were the virulent attacks made by\r\ndivines fifty years ago against Geology, and the still older ones of the\r\nCatholic Church against Galileo, for the public is wise enough always to\r\nfollow Scientific men when they agree on any subject; and now there is\r\nalmost complete unanimity amongst Biologists about Evolution, though\r\nthere is still considerable difference as to the means, such as how far\r\nnatural selection has acted, and how far external conditions, or whether\r\nthere exists some mysterious innate tendency to perfectability. I\r\nremain, dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours faithfully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Theologians were not the only adversaries of freedom in science. On\r\nSeptember 22, 1877, Prof. Virchow delivered an address at the Munich\r\nmeeting of German Naturalists and Physicians, which had the effect of\r\nconnecting Socialism with the Descent theory. This point of view was\r\ntaken up by anti-evolutionists to such an extent that, according to\r\nHaeckel, the \"Kreuz Zeitung\" threw \"all the blame of\" the \"treasonable\r\nattempts of the democrats Hodel and Nobiling... directly on the theory of\r\nDescent.\" Prof. Haeckel replied with vigour and ability in his 'Freedom\r\nin Science and Teaching' (English Translation 1879), an essay which must\r\nhave the sympathy of all lovers of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe following passage from a letter (December 26, 1879) to Dr. Scherzer,\r\nthe author of the 'Voyage of the \"Novara\",' gives a hint of my father's\r\nviews on this once burning question:--\r\n\r\n\"What a foolish idea seems to prevail in Germany on the connection\r\nbetween Socialism and Evolution through Natural Selection.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO H.N.

You will perhaps be surprised how slow I have been, but\r\nmy head prevents me reading except at intervals. If I were asked which\r\nparts have interested me most, I should be somewhat puzzled to answer.\r\nI fancy that the general reader would prefer your account of Japan.\r\nFor myself I hesitate between your discussions and description of the\r\nSouthern ice, which seems to me admirable, and the last chapter which\r\ncontained many facts and views new to me, though I had read your papers\r\non the stony Hydroid Corals, yet your resume made me realise better than\r\nI had done before, what a most curious case it is.\r\n\r\nYou have also collected a surprising number of valuable facts bearing on\r\nthe dispersal of plants, far more than in any other book known to me.\r\nIn fact your volume is a mass of interesting facts and discussions,\r\nwith hardly a superfluous word; and I heartily congratulate you on its\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nYour dedication makes me prouder than ever.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours sincerely, CH.

Dr. Goodacre, and was glad of the\r\nopportunity of testing the accuracy of the statement that these species\r\nare fertile inter se. This fact, which was given in the 'Origin' on\r\nthe authority of Mr. Eyton, he considered the most remarkable as\r\nyet recorded with respect to the fertility of hybrids. The fact (as\r\nconfirmed by himself and Dr. Goodacre) is of interest as giving another\r\nproof that sterility is no criterion of specific difference, since the\r\ntwo species of goose now shown to be fertile inter se are so distinct\r\nthat they have been placed by some authorities in distinct genera or\r\nsub-genera.\r\n\r\nThe following letter refers to Mr. Huxley's lecture: \"The Coming of Age\r\nof the Origin of Species\" (This same \"Coming of Age\" was the subject\r\nof an address from the Council of the Otago Institute. It is given in\r\n'Nature,' February 24, 1881.), given at the Royal Institution, April 9,\r\n1880, published in 'Nature,' and in 'Science and Culture,' page 310:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Abinger Hall, Dorking, Sunday, April 11,\r\n1880.\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nI wished much to attend your Lecture, but I have had a bad cough, and we\r\nhave come here to see whether a change would do me good, as it has done.\r\nWhat a magnificent success your lecture seems to have been, as I judge\r\nfrom the reports in the \"Standard\" and \"Daily News\", and more especially\r\nfrom the accounts given me by three of my children. I suppose that you\r\nhave not written out your lecture, so I fear there is no chance of its\r\nbeing printed in extenso. You appear to have piled, as on so many other\r\noccasions, honours high and thick on my old head. But I well know how\r\ngreat a part you have played in establishing and spreading the belief in\r\nthe descen-theory, ever since that grand review in the \"Times\" and the\r\nbattle royal at Oxford up to the present day.\r\n\r\nEver my dear Huxley, Yours sincerely and gratefully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--It was absurdly stupid in me, but I had read the announcement of\r\nyour Lecture, and thought that you meant the maturity of the subject,\r\nuntil my wife one day remarked, \"it is almost twenty-one years since\r\nthe 'Origin' appeared,\" and then for the first time the meaning of your\r\nwords flashed on me!\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the above-mentioned lecture Mr. Huxley made a strong point of the\r\naccumulation of palaeontological evidence which the years between 1859\r\nand 1880 have given us in favour of Evolution. On this subject my father\r\nwrote (August 31, 1880):]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Professor Marsh,\r\n\r\nI received some time ago your very kind note of July 28th, and yesterday\r\nthe magnificent volume. (Odontornithes. A Monograph on the extinct\r\nToothed Birds of North America. 1880. By O.C. Marsh.) I have looked with\r\nrenewed admiration at the plates, and will soon read the text. Your work\r\non these old birds, and on the many fossil animals of North America has\r\nafforded the best support to the theory of Evolution, which has appeared\r\nwithin the last twenty years. (Mr. Huxley has well pointed out ('Science\r\nand Culture,' page 317) that: \"In 1875, the discovery of the toothed\r\nbirds of the cretaceous formation in North America, by Prof. Marsh,\r\ncompleted the series of transitional forms between birds and reptiles,\r\nand removed Mr. Darwin's proposition that, 'many animal forms of life\r\nhave been utterly lost, through which the early progenitors of birds\r\nwere formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other\r\nvertebrate classes,' from the region of hypothesis to that of\r\ndemonstrable fact.\") The general appearance of the copy which you have\r\nsent me is worthy of its contents, and I can say nothing stronger than\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nWith cordial thanks, believe me, Yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In November, 1880, he received an account of a flood in Brazil, from\r\nwhich his friend Fritz Muller had barely escaped with his life. My\r\nfather immediately wrote to Hermann Muller anxiously enquiring whether\r\nhis brother had lost books, instruments, etc., by this accident, and\r\nbegging in that case \"for the sake of science, so that science should\r\nnot suffer,\" to be allowed to help in making good the loss. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, the injury to Fritz Muller's possessions was not so great as\r\nwas expected, and the incident remains only as a memento, which I trust\r\ncannot be otherwise than pleasing to the survivor, of the friendship of\r\nthe two naturalists.\r\n\r\nIn 'Nature' (November 11, 1880) appeared a letter from my father,\r\nwhich is, I believe, the only instance in which he wrote publicly with\r\nanything like severity. The late Sir Wyville Thomson wrote, in the\r\nIntroduction to the 'Voyage of the \"Challenger\"': \"The character of\r\nthe abyssal fauna refuses to give the least support to the theory which\r\nrefers the evolution of species to extreme variation guided only by\r\nnatural selection.\" My father, after characterising these remarks as\r\na \"standard of criticism, not uncommonly reached by theologians\r\nand metaphysicians,\" goes on to take exception to the term \"extreme\r\nvariation,\" and challenges Sir Wyville to name any one who has \"said\r\nthat the evolution of species depends only on natural selection.\" The\r\nletter closes with an imaginary scene between Sir Wyville and a breeder,\r\nin which Sir Wyville criticises artificial selection in a somewhat\r\nsimilar manner. The breeder is silent, but on the departure of his\r\ncritic he is supposed to make use of \"emphatic but irreverent language\r\nabout naturalists.\" The letter, as originally written, ended with a\r\nquotation from Sedgwick on the invulnerability of those who write on\r\nwhat they do not understand, but this was omitted on the advice of a\r\nfriend, and curiously enough a friend whose combativeness in the good\r\ncause my father had occasionally curbed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO G.J. ROMANES. Down, April 16, 1881.\r\n\r\nMy dear Romanes,\r\n\r\nMy MS. on 'Worms' has been sent to the printers, so I am going to amuse\r\nmyself by scribbling to you on a few points; but you must not waste your\r\ntime in answering at any length this scribble.\r\n\r\nFirstly, your letter on intelligence was very useful to me and I tor\r\nup and re-wrote what I sent to you. I have not attempted to define\r\nintelligence; but have quoted your remarks on experience, and have shown\r\nhow far they apply to worms. It seems to me that they must be said\r\nto work with some intelligence, anyhow they are not guided by a blind\r\ninstinct.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I was greatly interested by the abstract in 'Nature' of your\r\nwork on Echinoderms (\"On the locomotor system of Echinoderms,\" by G.J.\r\nRomanes and J. Cossar Ewart. 'Philosophical Transactions,' 1881,\r\npage 829.), the complexity with simplicity, and with such curious\r\nco-ordination of the nervous system is marvellous; and you showed me\r\nbefore what splendid gymnastic feats they can perform.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Dr. Roux has sent me a book just published by him: 'Der Kampf\r\nder Theile,' etc., 1881 (240 pages in length).\r\n\r\nHe is manifestly a well-read physiologist and pathologist, and from his\r\nposition a good anatomist. It is full of reasoning, and this in German\r\nis very difficult to me, so that I have only skimmed through each\r\npage; here and there reading with a little more care. As far as I can\r\nimperfectly judge, it is the most important book on Evolution, which\r\nhas appeared for some time. I believe that G.H. Lewes hinted at the same\r\nfundamental idea, viz. that there is a struggle going on within every\r\norganism between the organic molecules, the cells and the organs.\r\nI think that his basis is, that every cell which best performs its\r\nfunction is, in consequence, at the same time best nourished and best\r\npropagates its kind. The book does not touch on mental phenomena, but\r\nthere is much discussion on rudimentary or atrophied parts, to which\r\nsubject you formerly attended. Now if you would like to read this book,\r\nI would sent it... If you read it, and are struck with it (but I may\r\nbe WHOLLY mistaken about its value), you would do a public service by\r\nanalysing and criticising it in 'Nature.'\r\n\r\nDr. Roux makes, I think, a gigantic oversight in never considering\r\nplants; these would simplify the problem for him.\r\n\r\nFourthly, I do not know whether you will discuss in your book on the\r\nmind of animals any of the more complex and wonderful instincts. It is\r\nunsatisfactory work, as there can be no fossilised instincts, and the\r\nsole guide is their state in other members of the same order, and mere\r\nPROBABILITY.\r\n\r\nBut if you do discuss any (and it will perhaps be expected of you), I\r\nshould think that you could not select a better case than that of the\r\nsand wasps, which paralyse their prey, as formerly described by\r\nFabre, in his wonderful paper in the 'Annales des Sciences,' and since\r\namplified in his admirable 'Souvenirs.'\r\n\r\nWhilst reading this latter book, I speculated a little on the subject.\r\nAstonishing nonsense is often spoken of the sand wasp's knowledge of\r\nanatomy. Now will any one say that the Gauchos on the plains of La Plata\r\nhave such knowledge, yet I have often seen them pith a struggling and\r\nlassoed cow on the ground with unerring skill, which no mere anatomist\r\ncould imitate. The pointed knife was infallibly driven in between the\r\nvertebrae by a single slight thrust. I presume that the art was first\r\ndiscovered by chance, and that each young Gaucho sees exactly how the\r\nothers do it, and then with a very little practice learns the art. Now\r\nI suppose that the sand wasps originally merely killed their prey by\r\nstinging them in many places (see page 129 of Fabre's 'Souvenirs,' and\r\npage 241) on the lower and softest side of the body--and that to sting\r\na certain segment was found by far the most successful method; and was\r\ninherited like the tendency of a bulldog to pin the nose of a bull, or\r\nof a ferret to bite the cerebellum. It would not be a very great step\r\nin advance to prick the ganglion of its prey only slightly, and thus\r\nto give its larvae fresh meat instead of old dried meat. Though Fabre\r\ninsists so strongly on the unvarying character of instinct, yet it is\r\nshown that there is some variability, as at pages 176, 177.\r\n\r\nI fear that I shall have utterly wearied you with my scribbling and bad\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\nMy dear Romanes, yours, very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT OF A LETTER TO PROFESSOR A. AGASSIZ, MAY 5TH, 1881:--\r\n\r\nI read with much interest your address before the American Association.\r\nHowever true your remarks on the genealogies of the several groups may\r\nbe, I hope and believe that you have over-estimated the difficulties to\r\nbe encountered in the future:--A few days after reading your address, I\r\ninterpreted to myself your remarks on one point (I hope in some degree\r\ncorrectly) in the following fashion:--\r\n\r\nAny character of an ancient, generalised, or intermediate form may, and\r\noften does, re-appear in its descendants, after countless generations,\r\nand this explains the extraordinarily complicated affinities of existing\r\ngroups. This idea seems to me to throw a flood of light on the lines,\r\nsometimes used to represent affinities, which radiate in all directions,\r\noften to very distant sub-groups,--a difficulty which has haunted me for\r\nhalf a century. A strong case could be made out in favour of believing\r\nin such reversion after immense intervals of time. I wish the idea had\r\nbeen put into my head in old days, for I shall never again write on\r\ndifficult subjects, as I have seen too many cases of old men becoming\r\nfeeble in their minds, without being in the least conscious of it. If\r\nI have interpreted your ideas at all correctly, I hope that you will\r\nre-urge, on any fitting occasion, your view. I have mentioned it to a\r\nfew persons capable of judging, and it seemed quite new to them. I beg\r\nyou to forgive the proverbial garrulity of old age.\r\n\r\nC.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter refers to Sir J.D. Hooker's Geographical address\r\nat the York Meeting (1881) of the British Association:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, August 6, 1881.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nFor Heaven's sake never speak of boring me, as it would be the greatest\r\npleasure to aid you in the slightest degree and your letter has\r\ninterested me exceedingly. I will go through your points seriatim, but\r\nI have never attended much to the history of any subject, and my memory\r\nhas become atrociously bad. It will therefore be a mere chance whether\r\nany of my remarks are of any use.\r\n\r\nYour idea, to show what travellers have done, seems to me a brilliant\r\nand just one, especially considering your audience.\r\n\r\n1. I know nothing about Tournefort's works.\r\n\r\n2. I believe that you are fully right in calling Humboldt the greatest\r\nscientific traveller who ever lived, I have lately read two or three\r\nvolumes again. His Geology is funny stuff; but that merely means that he\r\nwas not in advance of his age. I should say he was wonderful, more for\r\nhis near approach to omniscience than for originality. Whether or not\r\nhis position as a scientific man is as eminent as we think, you might\r\ntruly call him the parent of a grand progeny of scientific travellers,\r\nwho, taken together, have done much for science.\r\n\r\n3. It seems to me quite just to give Lyell (and secondarily E. Forbes) a\r\nvery prominent place.\r\n\r\n4. Dana was, I believe, the first man who maintained the permanence\r\nof continents and the great oceans... When I read the 'Challenger's'\r\nconclusion that sediment from the land is not deposited at greater\r\ndistances than 200 or 300 miles from the land, I was much strengthened\r\nin my old belief. Wallace seems to me to have argued the case\r\nexcellently. Nevertheless, I would speak, if I were in your place,\r\nrather cautiously; for T. Mellard Reade has argued lately with some\r\nforce against the view; but I cannot call to mind his arguments. If\r\nforced to express a judgment, I should abide by the view of approximate\r\npermanence since Cambrian days.\r\n\r\n5. The extreme importance of the Arctic fossil-plants, is self-evident.\r\nTake the opportunity of groaning over [our] ignorance of the Lignite\r\nPlants of Kerguelen Land, or any Antarctic land. It might do good.\r\n\r\n6. I cannot avoid feeling sceptical about the travelling of plants from\r\nthe North EXCEPT DURING THE TERTIARY PERIOD. It may of course have been\r\nso and probably was so from one of the two poles at the earliest period,\r\nduring Pre-Cambrian ages; but such speculations seem to me hardly\r\nscientific seeing how little we know of the old Floras.\r\n\r\nI will now jot down without any order a few miscellaneous remarks.\r\n\r\nI think you ought to allude to Alph. De Candolle's great book, for\r\nthough it (like almost everything else) is washed out of my mind, yet I\r\nremember most distinctly thinking it a very valuable work. Anyhow, you\r\nmight allude to his excellent account of the history of all cultivated\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nHow shall you manage to allude to your New Zealand and Tierra del Fuego\r\nwork? if you do not allude to them you will be scandalously unjust.\r\n\r\nThe many Angiosperm plants in the Cretacean beds of the United States\r\n(and as far as I can judge the age of these beds has been fairly well\r\nmade out) seems to me a fact of very great importance, so is\r\ntheir relation to the existing flora of the United States under an\r\nEvolutionary point of view. Have not some Australian extinct forms been\r\nlately found in Australia? or have I dreamed it?\r\n\r\nAgain, the recent discovery of plants rather low down in our Silurian\r\nbeds is very important.\r\n\r\nNothing is more extraordinary in the history of the Vegetable Kingdom,\r\nas it seems to me, than the APPARENTLY very sudden or abrupt development\r\nof the higher plants. I have sometimes speculated whether there did\r\nnot exist somewhere during long ages an extremely isolated continent,\r\nperhaps near the South Pole.\r\n\r\nHence I was greatly interested by a view which Saporta propounded to me,\r\na few years ago, at great length in MS. and which I fancy he has\r\nsince published, as I urged him to do--viz., that as soon as\r\nflower-frequenting insects were developed, during the latter part of the\r\nsecondary period, an enormous impulse was given to the development of\r\nthe higher plants by cross-fertilization being thus suddenly formed.\r\n\r\nA few years ago I was much struck with Axel Blytt's Essay showing from\r\nobservation, on the peat beds in Scandinavia, that there had apparently\r\nbeen long periods with more rain and other with less rain (perhaps\r\nconnected with Croll's recurrent astronomical periods), and that these\r\nperiods had largely determined the present distribution of the plants of\r\nNorway and Sweden. This seemed to me, a very important essay.\r\n\r\nI have just read over my remarks and I fear that they will not be of the\r\nslightest use to you.\r\n\r\nI cannot but think that you have got through the hardest, or at least\r\nthe most difficult, part of your work in having made so good and\r\nstriking a sketch of what you intend to say; but I can quite understand\r\nhow you must groan over the great necessary labour.\r\n\r\nI most heartily sympathise with you on the successes of B. and R.:\r\nas years advance what happens to oneself becomes of very little\r\nconsequence, in comparison with the careers of our children.\r\n\r\nKeep your spirits up, for I am convinced that you will make an excellent\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nEver yours, affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In September he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"I have this minute finished reading your splendid but too short\r\naddress. I cannot doubt that it will have been fully appreciated by the\r\nGeographers of York; if not, they are asses and fools.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO JOHN LUBBOCK. Sunday evening [1881].\r\n\r\nMy dear L.,\r\n\r\nYour address (Presidential Address at the York meeting of the British\r\nAssociation.) has made me think over what have been the great steps in\r\nGeology during the last fifty years, and there can be no harm in telling\r\nyou my impression. But it is very odd that I cannot remember what you\r\nhave said on Geology. I suppose that the classification of the Silurian\r\nand Cambrian formations must be considered the greatest or most\r\nimportant step; for I well remember when all these older rocks were\r\ncalled grau-wacke, and nobody dreamed of classing them; and now we have\r\nthree azoic formations pretty well made out beneath the Cambrian! But\r\nthe most striking step has been the discovery of the Glacial period: you\r\nare too young to remember the prodigious effect this produced about the\r\nyear 1840 (?) on all our minds. Elie de Beaumont never believed in it to\r\nthe day of his death! the study of the glacial deposits led to the study\r\nof the superficial drift, which was formerly NEVER STUDIED and called\r\nDiluvium, as I well remember. The study under the microscope of\r\nrock-sections is another not inconsiderable step. So again the making\r\nout of cleavage and the foliation of the metamorphic rocks. But I will\r\nnot run on, having now eased my mind. Pray do not waste even one minute\r\nin acknowledging my horrid scrawls.\r\n\r\nEver yours, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following extracts referring to the late Francis Maitland Balfour\r\n(Professor of Animal Morphology at Cambridge.

With respect to Automatism\r\n(\"On the hypothesis that animals are automata and its history,\" an\r\nAddress given at the Belfast meeting of the British Association, 1874,\r\nand published in the 'Fortnightly Review,' 1874, and in 'Science and\r\nCulture.'), I wish that you could review yourself in the old, and\r\nof course forgotten, trenchant style, and then you would here answer\r\nyourself with equal incisiveness; and thus, by Jove, you might go on ad\r\ninfinitum, to the joy and instruction of the world.\r\n\r\nEver yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter refers to Dr. Ogle's translation of Aristotle, 'On\r\nthe Parts of Animals' (1882):]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W. OGLE. Down, February 22, 1882.\r\n\r\nMy dear Dr. Ogle,\r\n\r\nYou must let me thank you for the pleasure which the introduction to\r\nthe Aristotle book has given me. I have rarely read anything which has\r\ninterested me more, though I have not read as yet more than a quarter of\r\nthe book proper.\r\n\r\nFrom quotations which I had seen, I had a high notion of Aristotle's\r\nmerits, but I had not the most remote notion what a wonderful man he\r\nwas. Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different\r\nways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle. How very curious,\r\nalso, his ignorance on some points, as on muscles as the means of\r\nmovement. I am glad that you have explained in so probable a manner some\r\nof the grossest mistakes attributed to him. I never realized, before\r\nreading your book, to what an enormous summation of labour we owe even\r\nour common knowledge. I wish old Aristotle could know what a grand\r\nDefender of the Faith he had found in you. Believe me, my dear Dr. Ogle,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In February, he received a letter and a specimen from a Mr. W.D.

This class of fact had a special charm for him, and he\r\nwrote to 'Nature,' describing the case. ('Nature,' April 6, 1882.)\r\n\r\nIn April he received a letter from Dr. W. Van Dyck, Lecturer in Zoology\r\nat the Protestant College of Beyrout. The letter showed that the street\r\ndogs of Beyrout had been rapidly mongrelised by introduced European\r\ndogs, and the facts have an interesting bearing on my father's theory of\r\nSexual Selection.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.T. VAN DYCK. Down, April 3, 1882.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAfter much deliberation, I have thought it best to send your very\r\ninteresting paper to the Zoological Society, in hopes that it will\r\nbe published in their Journal. This journal goes to every scientific\r\ninstitution in the world, and the contents are abstracted in all\r\nyear-books on Zoology. Therefore I have preferred it to 'Nature,' though\r\nthe latter has a wider circulation, but is ephemeral.\r\n\r\nI have prefaced your essay by a few general remarks, to which I hope\r\nthat you will not object.\r\n\r\nOf course I do not know that the Zoological Society, which is much\r\naddicted to mere systematic work, will publish your essay. If it does, I\r\nwill send you copies of your essay, but these will not be ready for some\r\nmonths. If not published by the Zoological Society, I will endeavour\r\nto get 'Nature' to publish it. I am very anxious that it should be\r\npublished and preserved.\r\n\r\nDear Sir, Yours faithfully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The paper was read at a meeting of the Zoological Society on April\r\n18th--the day before my father's death.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary remarks with which Dr. Van Dyck's paper is prefaced are\r\nthus the latest of my father's writings.]\r\n\r\nWe must now return to an early period of his life, and give a connected\r\naccount of his botanical work, which has hitherto been omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.X. -- FERTILISATION OF FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n[In the letters already given we have had occasion to notice the general\r\nbearing of a number of botanical problems on the wider question of\r\nEvolution. The detailed work in botany which my father accomplished by\r\nthe guidance of the light cast on the study of natural history by his\r\nown work on Evolution remains to be noticed. In a letter to Mr. Murray,\r\nSeptember 24th, 1861, speaking of his book on the 'Fertilisation of\r\nOrchids,' he says: \"It will perhaps serve to illustrate how Natural\r\nHistory may be worked under the belief of the modification of species.\"\r\nThis remark gives a suggestion as to the value and interest of his\r\nbotanical work, and it might be expressed in far more emphatic language\r\nwithout danger of exaggeration.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter to Mr. Murray, he says: \"I think this little volume\r\nwill do good to the 'Origin,' as it will show that I have worked hard\r\nat details.\" It is true that his botanical work added a mass of\r\ncorroborative detail to the case for Evolution, but the chief support\r\nto his doctrines given by these researches was of another kind. They\r\nsupplied an argument against those critics who have so freely dogmatised\r\nas to the uselessness of particular structures, and as to the consequent\r\nimpossibility of their having been developed by means of natural\r\nselection. His observations on Orchids enabled him to say: \"I can show\r\nthe meaning of some of the apparently meaningless ridges, horns, who\r\nwill now venture to say that this or that structure is useless?\" A\r\nkindred point is expressed in a letter to Sir J.D. Hooker (May 14th,\r\n1862:)--\r\n\r\n\"When many parts of structure, as in the woodpecker, show distinct\r\nadaptation to external bodies, it is preposterous to attribute them to\r\nthe effects of climate, etc., but when a single point alone, as a hooked\r\nseed, it is conceivable it may thus have arisen. I have found the study\r\nof Orchids eminently useful in showing me how nearly all parts of the\r\nflower are co-adapted for fertilization by insects, and therefore\r\nthe results of natural selection--even the most trifling details of\r\nstructure.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest services rendered by my father to the study of\r\nNatural History is the revival of Teleology. The evolutionist studies\r\nthe purpose or meaning of organs with the zeal of the older Teleology,\r\nbut with far wider and more coherent purpose. He has the invigorating\r\nknowledge that he is gaining not isolated conceptions of the economy\r\nof the present, but a coherent view of both past and present. And even\r\nwhere he fails to discover the use of any part, he may, by a knowledge\r\nof its structure, unravel the history of the past vicissitudes in the\r\nlife of the species. In this way a vigour and unity is given to the\r\nstudy of the forms of organised beings, which before it lacked.\r\nThis point has already been discussed in Mr. Huxley's chapter on the\r\n'Reception of the \"Origin of Species\",' and need not be here considered.\r\nIt does, however, concern us to recognize that this \"great service to\r\nnatural science,\" as Dr. Gray describes it, was effected almost as much\r\nby his special botanical work as by the 'Origin of Species.'\r\n\r\nFor a statement of the scope and influence of my father's botanical\r\nwork, I may refer to Mr. Thiselton Dyer's article in 'Charles Darwin,'\r\none of the \"Nature Series\". Mr. Dyer's wide knowledge, his friendship\r\nwith my father, and especially his power of sympathising with the work\r\nof others, combine to give this essay a permanent value. The following\r\npassage (page 43) gives a true picture:--\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding the extent and variety of his botanical work, Mr.\r\nDarwin always disclaimed any right to be regarded as a professed\r\nbotanist. He turned his attention to plants, doubtless because they\r\nwere convenient objects for studying organic phenomena in their least\r\ncomplicated forms; and this point of view, which, if one may use the\r\nexpression without disrespect, had something of the amateur about it,\r\nwas in itself of the greatest importance. For, from not being, till he\r\ntook up any point, familiar with the literature bearing on it, his mind\r\nwas absolutely free from any prepossession. He was never afraid of his\r\nfacts, or of framing any hypothesis, however startling, which seemed to\r\nexplain them... In any one else such an attitude would have produced\r\nmuch work that was crude and rash. But Mr. Darwin--if one may venture\r\non language which will strike no one who had conversed with him as\r\nover-strained--seemed by gentle persuasion to have penetrated that\r\nreserve of nature which baffles smaller men. In other words, his long\r\nexperience had given him a kind of instinctive insight into the method\r\nof attack of any biological problem, however unfamiliar to him, while\r\nhe rigidly controlled the fertility of his mind in hypothetical\r\nexplanations by the no less fertility of ingeniously devised\r\nexperiment.\"\r\n\r\nTo form any just idea of the greatness of the revolution worked by my\r\nfather's researches in the study of the fertilisation of flowers, it\r\nis necessary to know from what a condition this branch of knowledge has\r\nemerged. It should be remembered that it was only during the early\r\nyears of the present century that the idea of sex, as applied to plants,\r\nbecame at all firmly established. Sachs, in his 'History of Botany'\r\n(1875), has given some striking illustrations of the remarkable slowness\r\nwith which its acceptance gained ground. He remarks that when we\r\nconsider the experimental proofs given by Camerarius (1694), and by\r\nKolreuter (1761-66), it appears incredible that doubts should afterwards\r\nhave been raised as to the sexuality of plants. Yet he shows that such\r\ndoubts did actually repeatedly crop up. These adverse criticisms rested\r\nfor the most part on careless experiments, but in many cases on a priori\r\narguments. Even as late as 1820, a book of this kind, which would now\r\nrank with circle squaring, or flat-earth philosophy, was seriously\r\nnoticed in a botanical journal.\r\n\r\nA distinct conception of sex as applied to plants, had not long emerged\r\nfrom the mists of profitless discussion and feeble experiment, at the\r\ntime when my father began botany by attending Henslow's lectures at\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nWhen the belief in the sexuality of plants had become established as an\r\nincontrovertible piece of knowledge, a weight of misconception remained,\r\nweighing down any rational view of the subject. Camerarius (Sachs,\r\n'Geschichte,' page 419.) believed (naturally enough in his day) that\r\nhermaphrodite flowers are necessarily self-fertilised. He had the wit to\r\nbe astonished at this, a degree of intelligence which, as Sachs points\r\nout, the majority of his successors did not attain to.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from a note-book show that this point occurred to\r\nmy father as early as 1837:--\r\n\r\n\"Do not plants which have male and female organs together [i.e. in the\r\nsame flower] yet receive influence from other plants? Does not Lyell\r\ngive some argument about varieties being difficult to keep [true] on\r\naccount of pollen from other plants? Because this may be applied to show\r\nall plants do receive intermixture.\"\r\n\r\nSprengel (Christian Conrad Sprengel, 1750-1816.), indeed, understood\r\nthat the hermaphrodite structure of flowers by no means necessarily\r\nleads to self-fertilisation. But although he discovered that in many\r\ncases pollen is of necessity carried to the stigma of another FLOWER, he\r\ndid not understand that in the advantage gained by the intercrossing of\r\ndistinct PLANTS lies the key to the whole question. Hermann Muller has\r\nwell remarked that this \"omission was for several generations fatal to\r\nSprengel's work... For both at the time and subsequently, botanists felt\r\nabove all the weakness of his theory, and they set aside, along with his\r\ndefective ideas, his rich store of patient and acute observations and\r\nhis comprehensive and accurate interpretations.\" It remained for my\r\nfather to convince the world that the meaning hidden in the structure of\r\nflowers was to be found by seeking light in the same direction in which\r\nSprengel, seventy years before, had laboured. Robert Brown was the\r\nconnecting link between them, for it was at his recommendation that\r\nmy father in 1841 read Sprengel's now celebrated 'Secret of Nature\r\nDisplayed.' ('Das entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur im Baue und in der\r\nBefruchtung der Blumen.' Berlin, 1793.) The book impressed him as being\r\n\"full of truth,\" although \"with some little nonsense.\" It not only\r\nencouraged him in kindred speculation, but guided him in his work,\r\nfor in 1844 he speaks of verifying Sprengel's observations. It may be\r\ndoubted whether Robert Brown ever planted a more beautiful seed than in\r\nputting such a book into such hands.\r\n\r\nA passage in the 'Autobiography' (volume i.) shows how it was that my\r\nfather was attracted to the subject of fertilisation: \"During the summer\r\nof 1839, and I believe during the previous summer, I was led to attend\r\nto the cross-fertilisation of flowers by the aid of insects, from having\r\ncome to the conclusion in my speculations on the origin of species, that\r\ncrossing played an important part in keeping specific forms constant.\"\r\n\r\nThe original connection between the study of flowers and the problem of\r\nevolution is curious, and could hardly have been predicted. Moreover, it\r\nwas not a permanent bond. As soon as the idea arose that the offspring\r\nof cross-fertilisation is, in the struggle for life, likely to conquer\r\nthe seedlings of self-fertilised parentage, a far more vigorous belief\r\nin the potency of natural selection in moulding the structure of flowers\r\nis attained. A central idea is gained towards which experiment and\r\nobservation may be directed.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray has well remarked with regard to this central idea ('Nature,'\r\nJune 4, 1874):--\"The aphorism, 'Nature abhors a vacuum,' is a\r\ncharacteristic specimen of the science of the middle ages. The aphorism,\r\nNature abhors close fertilisation,' and the demonstration of the\r\nprinciple, belong to our age and to Mr. Darwin. To have originated this,\r\nand also the principle of Natural Selection... and to have applied these\r\nprinciples to the system of nature, in such a manner as to make, within\r\na dozen years, a deeper impression upon natural history than has been\r\nmade since Linnaeus, is ample title for one man's fame.\"\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the Papilionaceae attracted his attention early, and\r\nwere the subject of his first paper on fertilisation. (\"Gardeners'\r\nChronicle\", 1857, page 725. It appears that this paper was a piece of\r\n\"over-time\" work. He wrote to a friend, \"that confounded leguminous\r\npaper was done in the afternoon, and the consequence was I had to go to\r\nMoor Park for a week.\") The following extract from an undated letter to\r\nDr. Asa Gray seems to have been written before the publication of this\r\npaper, probably in 1856 or 1857:--\r\n\r\n\"... What you say on Papilionaceous flowers is very true; and I have no\r\nfacts to show that varieties are crossed; but yet (and the same remark\r\nis applicable in a beautiful way to Fumaria and Dielytra, as I noticed\r\nmany years ago), I must believe that the flowers are constructed partly\r\nin direct relation to the visits of insects; and how insects can avoid\r\nbringing pollen from other individuals I cannot understand. It is really\r\npretty to watch the action of a Humble-bee on the scarlet kidney bean,\r\nand in this genus (and in Lathyrus grandiflorus) the honey is so placed\r\nthat the bee invariably alights on that ONE side of the flower towards\r\nwhich the spiral pistil is protruded (bringing out with it pollen), and\r\nby the depression of the wing-petal is forced against the bee's side all\r\ndusted with pollen. (If you will look at a bed of scarlet kidney beans\r\nyou will find that the wing-petals on the LEFT side alone are all\r\nscratched by the tarsi of the bees. [Note in the original letter by C.\r\nDarwin.]) In the broom the pistil is rubbed on the centre of the back\r\nof the bee. I suspect there is something to be made out about the\r\nLeguminosae, which will bring the case within OUR theory; though I have\r\nfailed to do so. Our theory will explain why in the vegetable and animal\r\nkingdom the act of fertilisation even in hermaphrodites usually takes\r\nplace sub-jove, though thus exposed to GREAT injury from damp and rain.\r\nIn animals which cannot be [fertilised] by insects or wind, there is NO\r\nCASE of LAND-animals being hermaphrodite without the concourse of two\r\nindividuals.\"\r\n\r\nA letter to Dr. Asa Gray (September 5th, 1857) gives the substance of\r\nthe paper in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\":--\r\n\r\n\"Lately I was led to examine buds of kidney bean with the pollen shed;\r\nbut I was led to believe that the pollen could HARDLY get on the stigma\r\nby wind or otherwise, except by bees visiting [the flower] and moving\r\nthe wing petals: hence I included a small bunch of flowers in two\r\nbottles in every way treated the same: the flowers in one I daily just\r\nmomentarily moved, as if by a bee; these set three fine pods, the other\r\nNOT ONE. Of course this little experiment must be tried again, and this\r\nyear in England it is too late, as the flowers seem now seldom to set.\r\nIf bees are necessary to this flower's self-fertilisation, bees must\r\nalmost cross them, as their dusted right-side of head and right legs\r\nconstantly touch the stigma.\r\n\r\n\"I have, also, lately been re-observing daily Lobelia fulgens--this in\r\nmy garden is never visited by insects, and never sets seeds, without\r\npollen be put on the stigma (whereas the small blue Lobelia is visited\r\nby bees and does set seed); I mention this because there are such\r\nbeautiful contrivances to prevent the stigma ever getting its own\r\npollen; which seems only explicable on the doctrine of the advantage of\r\ncrosses.\"\r\n\r\nThe paper was supplemented by a second in 1858. (\"Gardeners' Chronicle\",\r\n1858, page 828. In 1861 another paper on Fertilisation appeared in the\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle\", page 552, in which he explained the action of\r\ninsects on Vinca major. He was attracted to the periwinkle by the fact\r\nthat it is not visited by insects and never set seeds.) The chief object\r\nof these publications seems to have been to obtain information as to the\r\npossibility of growing varieties of leguminous plants near each other,\r\nand yet keeping them true. It is curious that the Papilionaceae should\r\nnot only have been the first flowers which attracted his attention by\r\ntheir obvious adaptation to the visits of insects, but should also have\r\nconstituted one of his sorest puzzles. The common pea and the sweet pea\r\ngave him much difficulty, because, although they are as obviously fitted\r\nfor insect-visits as the rest of the order, yet their varieties keep\r\ntrue. The fact is that neither of these plants being indigenous, they\r\nare not perfectly adapted for fertilisation by British insects. He could\r\nnot, at this stage of his observations, know that the co-ordination\r\nbetween a flower and the particular insect which fertilises it may be\r\nas delicate as that between a lock and its key, so that this explanation\r\nwas not likely to occur to him. (He was of course alive to variety in\r\nthe habits of insects. He published a short note in the \"Entomologists\r\nWeekly Intelligencer\", 1860, asking whether the Tineina and other small\r\nmoths suck flowers.)\r\n\r\nBesides observing the Leguminosae, he had already begun, as shown in\r\nthe foregoing extracts, to attend to the structure of other flowers in\r\nrelation to insects. At the beginning of 1860 he worked at Leschenaultia\r\n(He published a short paper on the manner of fertilisation of this\r\nflower, in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\", 1871, page 1166.), which at first\r\npuzzled him, but was ultimately made out. A passage in a letter chiefly\r\nrelating to Leschenaultia seems to show that it was only in the spring\r\nof 1860 that he began widely to apply his knowledge to the relation of\r\ninsects to other flowers. This is somewhat surprising, when we remember\r\nthat he had read Sprengel many years before. He wrote (May 14):--\r\n\r\n\"I should look at this curious contrivance as specially related to\r\nvisits of insects; as I begin to think is almost universally the case.\"\r\n\r\nEven in July 1862 he wrote to Dr. Asa Gray:--\r\n\r\n\"There is no end to the adaptations. Ought not these cases to make\r\none very cautious when one doubts about the use of all parts? I fully\r\nbelieve that the structure of all irregular flowers is governed in\r\nrelation to insects. Insects are the Lords of the floral (to quote the\r\nwitty \"Athenaeum\") world.\"\r\n\r\nHe was probably attracted to the study of Orchids by the fact that\r\nseveral kinds are common near Down. The letters of 1860 show that these\r\nplants occupied a good deal of his attention; and in 1861 he gave part\r\nof the summer and all the autumn to the subject. He evidently considered\r\nhimself idle for wasting time on Orchids, which ought to have been given\r\nto 'Variation under Domestication.' Thus he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"There is to me incomparably more interest in observing than in writing;\r\nbut I feel quite guilty in trespassing on these subjects, and not\r\nsticking to varieties of the confounded cocks, hens and ducks. I hear\r\nthat Lyell is savage at me. I shall never resist Linum next summer.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of 1860 that he made out one of the most striking\r\nand familiar facts in the book, namely, the manner in which the pollen\r\nmasses in Orchis are adapted for removal by insects. He wrote to Sir\r\nJ.D. Hooker July 12:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been examining Orchis pyramidalis, and it almost equals, perhaps\r\neven beats, your Listera case; the sticky glands are congenitally united\r\ninto a saddle-shaped organ, which has great power of movement, and\r\nseizes hold of a bristle (or proboscis) in an admirable manner, and then\r\nanother movement takes place in the pollen masses, by which they\r\nare beautifully adapted to leave pollen on the two LATERAL stigmatic\r\nsurfaces. I never saw anything so beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nIn June of the same year he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"You speak of adaptation being rarely VISIBLE, though present in plants.\r\nI have just recently been looking at the common Orchis, and I declare I\r\nthink its adaptations in every part of the flower quite as beautiful and\r\nplain, or even more beautiful than in the Woodpecker. I have written and\r\nsent a notice for the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" (June 9, 1860. This seems\r\nto have attracted some attention, especially among entomologists, as it\r\nwas reprinted in the \"Entomologists Weekly Intelligencer\", 1860.), on a\r\ncurious difficulty in the Bee Orchis, and should much like to hear what\r\nyou think of the case. In this article I have incidentally touched on\r\nadaptation to visits of insects; but the contrivance to keep the sticky\r\nglands fresh and sticky beats almost everything in nature. I never\r\nremember having seen it described, but it must have been, and, as I\r\nought not in my book to give the observation as my own, I should be very\r\nglad to know where this beautiful contrivance is described.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote also to Dr. Gray, June 8, 1860:--\r\n\r\n\"Talking of adaptation, I have lately been looking at our common\r\norchids, and I dare say the facts are as old and well-known as the\r\nhills, but I have been so struck with admiration at the contrivances,\r\nthat I have sent a notice to the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\". The Ophrys\r\napifera, offers, as you will see, a curious contradiction in structure.\"\r\n\r\nBesides attending to the fertilisation of the flowers he was already, in\r\n1860, busy with the homologies of the parts, a subject of which he made\r\ngood use in the Orchid book. He wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker (July):--\r\n\r\n\"It is a real good joke my discussing homologies of Orchids with you,\r\nafter examining only three or four genera; and this very fact makes me\r\nfeel positive I am right! I do not quite understand some of your\r\nterms; but sometime I must get you to explain the homologies; for I am\r\nintensely interested on the subject, just as at a game of chess.\"\r\n\r\nThis work was valuable from a systematic point of view. In 1880 he wrote\r\nto Mr. Bentham:--\r\n\r\n\"It was very kind in you to write to me about the Orchideae, for it has\r\npleased me to an extreme degree that I could have been of the LEAST use\r\nto you about the nature of the parts.\"\r\n\r\nThe pleasure which his early observations on Orchids gave him is shown\r\nin such extracts as the following from a letter to Sir J.D. Hooker (July\r\n27, 1861):--\r\n\r\n\"You cannot conceive how the Orchids have delighted me. They came safe,\r\nbut box rather smashed; cylindrical old cocoa- or snuff-canister much\r\nsafer. I enclose postage. As an account of the movement, I shall allude\r\nto what I suppose is Oncidium, to make CERTAIN,--is the enclosed flower\r\nwith crumpled petals this genus? Also I most specially want to know what\r\nthe enclosed little globular brown Orchid is. I have only seen pollen\r\nof a Cattleya on a bee, but surely have you not unintentionally sent\r\nme what I wanted most (after Catasetum or Mormodes), viz. one of the\r\nEpidendreae?! I PARTICULARLY want (and will presently tell you why)\r\nanother spike of this little Orchid, with older flowers, some even\r\nalmost withered.\"\r\n\r\nHis delight in observation is again shown in a letter to Dr. Gray\r\n(1863). referring to Cruger's letters from Trinidad, he wrote:--\"Happy\r\nman, he has actually seen crowds of bees flying round Catasetum, with\r\nthe pollinia sticking to their backs!\"\r\n\r\nThe following extracts of letters to Sir J.D. Hooker illustrate further\r\nthe interest which his work excited in him:--\r\n\r\n\"Veitch sent me a grand lot this morning. What wonderful structures!\r\n\r\n\"I have now seen enough, and you must not send me more, for though I\r\nenjoy looking at them MUCH, and it has been very useful to me, seeing\r\nso many different forms, it is idleness. For my object each species\r\nrequires studying for days. I wish you had time to take up the group.\r\nI would give a good deal to know what the rostellum is, of which I have\r\ntraced so many curious modifications. I suppose it cannot be one of the\r\nstigmas (It is a modification of the upper stigma.), there seems a great\r\ntendency for two lateral stigmas to appear. My paper, though touching\r\non only subordinate points will run, I fear, to 100 MS. folio pages!\r\nThe beauty of the adaptation of parts seems to me unparalleled. I should\r\nthink or guess waxy pollen was most differentiated. In Cypripedium which\r\nseems least modified, and a much exterminated group, the grains are\r\nsingle. In ALL OTHERS, as far as I have seen, they are in packets of\r\nfour; and these packets cohere into many wedge-formed masses in Orchis;\r\ninto eight, four, and finally two. It seems curious that a flower should\r\nexist, which could AT MOST fertilise only two other flowers, seeing\r\nhow abundant pollen generally is; this fact I look at as explaining the\r\nperfection of the contrivance by which the pollen, so important from its\r\nfewness, is carried from flower to flower\" (1861).\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking of writing to you to-day, when your note with the\r\nOrchids came. What frightful trouble you have taken about Vanilla; you\r\nreally must not take an atom more; for the Orchids are more play than\r\nreal work. I have been much interested by Epidendrum, and have worked\r\nall morning at them; for heaven's sake, do not corrupt me by any more\"\r\n(August 30, 1861).\r\n\r\nHe originally intended to publish his notes on Orchids as a paper in the\r\nLinnean Society's Journal, but it soon became evident that a separate\r\nvolume would be a more suitable form of publication. In a letter to Sir\r\nJ.D. Hooker, September 24, 1861, he writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been acting, I fear that you will think, like a goose; and\r\nperhaps in truth I have. When I finished a few days ago my Orchis\r\npaper, which turns out 140 folio pages!! and thought of the expense of\r\nwoodcuts, I said to myself, I will offer the Linnean Society to withdraw\r\nit, and publish it in a pamphlet. It then flashed on me that perhaps\r\nMurray would publish it, so I gave him a cautious description, and\r\noffered to share risks and profits. This morning he writes that he\r\nwill publish and take all risks, and share profits and pay for all\r\nillustrations. It is a risk, and heaven knows whether it will not be a\r\ndead failure, but I have not deceived Murray, and [have] told him that\r\nit would interest those alone who cared much for natural history. I hope\r\nI do not exaggerate the curiosity of the many special contrivances.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote the two following letters to Mr. Murray about the publication\r\nof the book:]\r\n\r\nDown, September 21 [1861].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nWill you have the kindness to give me your opinion, which I shall\r\nimplicitly follow. I have just finished a very long paper intended for\r\nLinnean Society (the title is enclosed), and yesterday for the first\r\ntime it occurred to me that POSSIBLY it might be worth publishing\r\nseparately which would save me trouble and delay. The facts are new, and\r\nhave been collected during twenty years and strike me as curious. Like a\r\nBridgewater treatise, the chief object is to show the perfection of the\r\nmany contrivances in Orchids. The subject of propagation is interesting\r\nto most people, and is treated in my paper so that any woman could read\r\nit. Parts are dry and purely scientific; but I think my paper would\r\ninterest a good many of such persons who care for Natural History, but\r\nno others.\r\n\r\n... It would be a very little book, and I believe you think very little\r\nbooks objectionable. I have myself GREAT doubts on the subject. I am\r\nvery apt to think that my geese are swans; but the subject seems to me\r\ncurious and interesting.\r\n\r\nI beg you not to be guided in the least in order to oblige me, but as\r\nfar as you can judge, please give me your opinion. If I were to publish\r\nseparately, I would agree to any terms, such as half risk and half\r\nprofit, or what you liked; but I would not publish on my sole risk, for\r\nto be frank, I have been told that no publisher whatever, under such\r\ncircumstances, cares for the success of a book.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J. MURRAY. Down, September 24 [1861].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your note and very liberal offer. I have\r\nhad some qualms and fears. All that I can feel sure of is that the MS.\r\ncontains many new and curious facts, and I am sure the Essay would have\r\ninterested me, and will interest those who feel lively interest in the\r\nwonders of nature; but how far the public will care for such minute\r\ndetails, I cannot at all tell. It is a bold experiment; and at worst,\r\ncannot entail much loss; as a certain amount of sale will, I think, be\r\npretty certain. A large sale is out of the question. As far as I can\r\njudge, generally the points which interest me I find interest others;\r\nbut I make the experiment with fear and trembling,--not for my own sake,\r\nbut for yours...\r\n\r\n\r\n[On September 28th he wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"What a good soul you are not to sneer at me, but to pat me on the back.\r\nI have the greatest doubt whether I am not going to do, in publishing\r\nmy paper, a most ridiculous thing. It would annoy me much, but only for\r\nMurray's sake, if the publication were a dead failure.\"\r\n\r\nThere was still much work to be done, and in October he was still\r\nreceiving Orchids from Kew, and wrote to Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to thank you enough. I was almost mad at the wealth of\r\nOrchids.\" And again--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Veitch most generously has sent me two splendid buds of Mormodes,\r\nwhich will be capital for dissection, but I fear will never be\r\nirritable; so for the sake of charity and love of heaven do, I beseech\r\nyou, observe what movement takes place in Cychnoches, and what part must\r\nbe touched. Mr. V. has also sent me one splendid flower of Catasetum,\r\nthe most wonderful Orchid I have seen.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 13th he wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"It seems that I cannot exhaust your good nature. I have had the hardest\r\nday's work at Catasetum and buds of Mormodes, and believe I understand\r\nat last the mechanism of movements and the functions. Catasetum is\r\na beautiful case of slight modification of structure leading to new\r\nfunctions. I never was more interested in any subject in my life than in\r\nthis of Orchids. I owe very much to you.\"\r\n\r\nAgain to the same friend, November 1, 1861:--\r\n\r\n\"If you really can spare another Catasetum, when nearly ready, I shall\r\nbe most grateful; had I not better send for it? The case is truly\r\nmarvellous; the (so-called) sensation, or stimulus from a light touch\r\nis certainly transmitted through the antennae for more than one inch\r\nINSTANTANEOUSLY... A cursed insect or something let my last flower off\r\nlast night.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor de Candolle has remarked ('Darwin considere, etc.,' 'Archives\r\ndes Sciences Physiques et Naturelles,' 3eme periode. Tome vii. 481, 1882\r\n(May).) of my father, \"Ce n'est pas lui qui aurait demande de construire\r\ndes palais pour y loger des laboratoires.\" This was singularly true of\r\nhis orchid work, or rather it would be nearer the truth to say that\r\nhe had no laboratory, for it was only after the publication of the\r\n'Fertilisation of Orchids,' that he built himself a greenhouse. He wrote\r\nto Sir J.D. Hooker (December 24th, 1862):--\r\n\r\n\"And now I am going to tell you a MOST important piece of news!! I\r\nhave almost resolved to build a small hot-house; my neighbour's really\r\nfirs-rate gardener has suggested it, and offered to make me plans, and\r\nsee that it is well done, and he is really a clever fellow, who wins\r\nlots of prizes, and is very observant. He believes that we should\r\nsucceed with a little patience; it will be a grand amusement for me to\r\nexperiment with plants.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he wrote (February 15th, 1863):--\r\n\r\n\"I write now because the new hot-house is ready, and I long to stock it,\r\njust like a schoolboy. Could you tell me pretty soon what plants you can\r\ngive me; and then I shall know what to order? And do advise me how I had\r\nbetter get such plants as you can SPARE. Would it do to send my tax-cart\r\nearly in the morning, on a day that was not frosty, lining the cart with\r\nmats, and arriving here before night? I have no idea whether this\r\ndegree of exposure (and of course the cart would be cold) could injure\r\nstov-plants; they would be about five hours (with bait) on the journey\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\nA week later he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"you cannot imagine what pleasure your plants give me (far more than\r\nyour dead Wedgwood ware can give you); and I go and gloat over them,\r\nbut we privately confessed to each other, that if they were not our own,\r\nperhaps we should not see such transcendent beauty in each leaf.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in March, when he was extremely unwell he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"A few words about the Stove-plants; they do so amuse me. I have crawled\r\nto see them two or three times. Will you correct and answer, and return\r\nenclosed. I have hunted in all my books and cannot find these names\r\n(His difficulty with regard to the names of plants is illustrated, with\r\nregard to a Lupine on which he was at work, in an extract from a letter\r\n(July 21, 1866) to Sir J.D. Hooker: \"I sent to the nursery garden,\r\nwhence I bought the seed, and could only hear that it was 'the common\r\nblue Lupine,' the man saying 'he was no scholard, and did not know\r\nLatin, and that parties who make experiments ought to find out the\r\nnames.'\"), and I like much to know the family.\"\r\n\r\nThe book was published May 15th, 1862. Of its reception he writes to\r\nMurray, June 13th and 18th:--\r\n\r\n\"The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies. Some one sent me\r\n(perhaps you) the 'Parthenon,' with a good review. The \"Athenaeum\" (May\r\n24, 1862.) treats me with very kind pity and contempt; but the reviewer\r\nknew nothing of his subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a superb, but I fear exaggerated, review in the 'London\r\nReview,' (June 14, 1862.) But I have not been a fool, as I thought I\r\nwas, to publish (Doubts on this point still, however, occurred to him\r\nabout this time. He wrote to Prof. Oliver (June 8): \"I am glad that\r\nyou have read my Orchis-book and seem to approve of it; for I never\r\npublished anything which I so much doubted whether it was worth\r\npublishing, and indeed I still doubt. The subject interested me beyond\r\nwhat, I suppose, it is worth.\"); for Asa Gray, about the most competent\r\njudge in the world, thinks almost as highly of the book as does the\r\n'London Review.' The \"Athenaeum\" will hinder the sale greatly.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. M.J. Berkeley was the author of the notice in the 'London\r\nReview,' as my father learned from Sir J.D. Hooker, who added, 'I\r\nthought it very well done indeed. I have read a good deal of the\r\nOrchid-book, and echo all he says.\"\r\n\r\nTo this my father replied (June 30th, 1862):--\r\n\r\n\"My dear Old Friend,\r\n\r\nYou speak of my warming the cockles of your heart, but you will never\r\nknow how often you have warmed mine. It is not your approbation of my\r\nscientific work (though I care for that more than for any one's): it is\r\nsomething deeper. To this day I remember keenly a letter you wrote to me\r\nfrom Oxford, when I was at the Water-cure, and how it cheered me when I\r\nwas utterly weary of life. Well, my Orchis-book is a success (but I do\r\nnot know whether it sells.)\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter to the same friend, he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"You have pleased me much by what you say in regard to Bentham and\r\nOliver approving of my book; for I had got a sort of nervousness,\r\nand doubted whether I had not made an egregious fool of myself, and\r\nconcocted pleasant little stinging remarks for reviews, such as 'Mr.\r\nDarwin's head seems to have been turned by a certain degree of\r\nsuccess, and he thinks that the most trifling observations are worth\r\npublication.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bentham's approval was given in his Presidential Address to the\r\nLinnean Society, May 24, 1862, and was all the more valuable because\r\nit came from one who was by no means supposed to be favourable to\r\nevolutionary doctrines.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, June 10 [1862].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nYour generous sympathy makes you overestimate what you have read of my\r\nOrchid-book. But your letter of May 18th and 26th has given me an almost\r\nfoolish amount of satisfaction. The subject interested me, I knew,\r\nbeyond its real value; but I had lately got to think that I had made\r\nmyself a complete fool by publishing in a semi-popular form. Now I shall\r\nconfidently defy the world. I have heard that Bentham and Oliver approve\r\nof it; but I have heard the opinion of no one else whose opinion is\r\nworth a farthing... No doubt my volume contains much error: how curiously\r\ndifficult it is to be accurate, though I try my utmost. Your notes have\r\ninterested me beyond measure. I can now afford to d-- my critics with\r\nineffable complacency of mind. Cordial thanks for this benefit. It\r\nis surprising to me that you should have strength of mind to care for\r\nscience, amidst the awful events daily occurring in your country. I\r\ndaily look at the \"Times\" with almost as much interest as an American\r\ncould do. When will peace come? it is dreadful to think of the\r\ndesolation of large parts of your magnificent country; and all the\r\nspeechless misery suffered by many. I hope and think it not unlikely\r\nthat we English are wrong in concluding that it will take a long time\r\nfor prosperity to return to you. It is an awful subject to reflect on...\r\n\r\n\r\n[Dr. Asa Gray reviewed the book in 'Silliman's Journal' ('Silliman's\r\nJournal,' volume xxiv. page 138. Here is given an account of the\r\nfertilisation of Platanthera Hookeri. P. hyperborea is discussed in\r\nDr. Gray's 'Enumeration' in the same volume, page 259; also, with other\r\nspecies, in a second notice of the Orchid-book at page 420.), where he\r\nspeaks, in strong terms, of the fascination which it must have for even\r\nslightly instructed readers. He made, too, some original observations on\r\nan American orchid, and these first-fruits of the subject, sent in MS.\r\nor proof sheet to my father, were welcomed by him in a letter (July\r\n23rd):--\r\n\r\n\"Last night, after writing the above, I read the great bundle of notes.\r\nLittle did I think what I had to read. What admirable observations! You\r\nhave distanced me on my own hobby-horse! I have not had for weeks such a\r\nglow of pleasure as your observations gave me.\"\r\n\r\nThe next letter refers to the publication of the review:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, July 28 [1862].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI hardly know what to thank for first. Your stamps gave infinite\r\nsatisfaction. I took him (One of his boys who was ill.) first one lot,\r\nand then an hour afterwards another lot. He actually raised himself on\r\none elbow to look at them. It was the first animation he showed. He said\r\nonly: \"You must thank Professor Gray awfully.\" In the evening after\r\na long silence, there came out the oracular sentence: \"He is awfully\r\nkind.\" And indeed you are, overworked as you are, to take so much\r\ntrouble for our poor dear little man.--And now I must begin the\r\n\"awfullys\" on my own account: what a capital notice you have published\r\non the orchids! It could not have been better; but I fear that you\r\noverrate it. I am very sure that I had not the least idea that you or\r\nany one would approve of it so much. I return your last note for the\r\nchance of your publishing any notice on the subject; but after all\r\nperhaps you may not think it worth while; yet in my judgment SEVERAL of\r\nyour facts, especially Platanthera hyperborea, are MUCH too good to be\r\nmerged in a review. But I have always noticed that you are prodigal in\r\noriginality in your reviews...\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sir Joseph Hooker reviewed the book in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\",\r\nwriting in a successful imitation of the style of Lindley, the Editor.\r\nMy father wrote to Sir Joseph (November 12, 1862):--\r\n\r\n\"So you did write the review in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\". Once or\r\ntwice I doubted whether it was Lindley; but when I came to a little slap\r\nat R. Brown, I doubted no longer. You arch-rogue! I do not wonder you\r\nhave deceived others also. Perhaps I am a conceited dog; but if so, you\r\nhave much to answer for; I never received so much praise, and coming\r\nfrom you I value it much more than from any other.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to botanical opinion generally, he wrote to Dr. Gray, \"I\r\nam fairly astonished at the success of my book with botanists.\" Among\r\nnaturalists who were not botanists, Lyell was pre-eminent in his\r\nappreciation of the book. I have no means of knowing when he read it,\r\nbut in later life, as I learn from Professor Judd, he was enthusiastic\r\nin praise of the 'Fertilisation of Orchids,' which he considered \"next\r\nto the 'Origin,' as the most valuable of all Darwin's works.\" Among the\r\ngeneral public the author did not at first hear of many disciples, thus\r\nhe wrote to his cousin Fox in September 1862: \"Hardly any one not a\r\nbotanist, except yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it.\"\r\n\r\nA favourable notice appeared in the \"Saturday Review\", October 18th,\r\n1862; the reviewer points out that the book would escape the angry\r\npolemics aroused by the 'Origin.' (Dr. Gray pointed out that if the\r\nOrchid-book (with a few trifling omissions) had appeared before the\r\n'Origin,' the author would have been canonised rather than anathematised\r\nby the natural theologians.) This is illustrated by a review in the\r\n\"Literary Churchman\", in which only one fault found, namely, that Mr.\r\nDarwin's expression of admiration at the contrivances in orchids is too\r\nindirect a way of saying, \"O Lord, how manifold are Thy works!\"\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar criticism occurs in the 'Edinburgh Review' (October\r\n1862). The writer points out that Mr. Darwin constantly uses phrases,\r\nsuch as \"beautiful contrivance,\" \"the labellum is... IN ORDER TO\r\nattract,\" \"the nectar is PURPOSELY lodged.\" The Reviewer concludes his\r\ndiscussion thus: \"We know, too that these purposes and ideas are not our\r\nown, but the ideas and purposes of Another.\"\r\n\r\nThe 'Edinburgh' reviewer's treatment of this subject was criticised\r\nin the \"Saturday Review\", November 15th, 1862: With reference to this\r\narticle my father wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker (December 29th, 1862):--\r\n\r\n\"Here is an odd chance; my nephew Henry Parker, an Oxford Classic, and\r\nFellow of Oriel, came here this evening; and I asked him whether he\r\nknew who had written the little article in the \"Saturday\", smashing the\r\n[Edinburgh reviewer], which we liked; and after a little hesitation he\r\nowned he had. I never knew that he wrote in the \"Saturday\"; and was it\r\nnot an odd chance?\"\r\n\r\nThe 'Edinburgh' article was written by the Duke of Argyll, and has\r\nsince been made use of in his 'Reign of Law,' 1867. Mr. Wallace replied\r\n('Quarterly Journal of Science,' October 1867. Republished in 'Natural\r\nSelection,' 1871.) to the Duke's criticisms, making some specially good\r\nremarks on those which refer to orchids. He shows how, by a \"beautiful\r\nself-acting adjustment,\" the nectary of the orchid Angraecum (from 10 to\r\n14 inches in length), and the proboscis of a moth sufficiently long to\r\nreach the nectar, might be developed by natural selection. He goes on to\r\npoint out that on any other theory we must suppose that the flower was\r\ncreated with an enormously long nectary, and that then by a special act,\r\nan insect was created fitted to visit the flower, which would otherwise\r\nremain sterile. With regard to this point my father wrote (October 12 or\r\n13, 1867):--\r\n\r\n\"I forgot to remark how capitally you turn the tables on the Duke, when\r\nyou make him create the Angraecum and Moth by special creation.\"\r\n\r\nIf we examine the literature relating to the fertilisation of flowers,\r\nwe do not find that this new branch of study showed any great activity\r\nimmediately after the publication of the Orchid-book. There are a few\r\npapers by Asa Gray, in 1862 and 1863, by Hildebrand in 1864, and\r\nby Moggridge in 1865, but the great mass of work by Axell, Delpino,\r\nHildebrand, and the Mullers, did not begin to appear until about 1867.\r\nThe period during which the new views were being assimilated, and before\r\nthey became thoroughly fruitful, was, however, surprisingly short. The\r\nlater activity in this department may be roughly gauged by the fact\r\nthat the valuable 'Bibliography,' given by Prof. D'Arcy Thompson in his\r\ntranslation of Muller's 'Befruchtung' (1883), contains references to 814\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nBesides the book on Orchids, my father wrote two or three papers on the\r\nsubject, which will be found mentioned in the Appendix. The earliest of\r\nthese, on the three sexual forms of Catasetum, was published in 1862; it\r\nis an anticipation of part of the Orchid-book, and was merely published\r\nin the Linnean Society's Journal, in acknowledgment of the use made of\r\na specimen in the Society's possession. The possibility of apparently\r\ndistinct species being merely sexual forms of a single species,\r\nsuggested a characteristic experiment, which is alluded to in the\r\nfollowing letter to one of his earliest disciples in the study of the\r\nfertilisation of flowers:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J. TRAHERNE MOGGRIDGE. (The late Mr. Moggridge, author\r\nof 'Harvesting Ants and Trap-door Spiders,' 'Flora of Mentone,' etc.)\r\nDown, October 13 [1865].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am especially obliged to you for your beautiful plates and\r\nletter-press; for no single point in natural history interests and\r\nperplexes me so much as the self-fertilisation (He once remarked to Dr.\r\nNorman Moore that one of the things that made him wish to live a\r\nfew thousand years, was his desire to see the extinction of the\r\nBee-orchis,--an end to which he believed its self-fertilising habit was\r\nleading.) of the Bee-orchis. You have already thrown some light on the\r\nsubject, and your present observations promise to throw more.\r\n\r\nI formed two conjectures: first, that some insect during certain seasons\r\nmight cross the plants, but I have almost given up this; nevertheless,\r\npray have a look at the flowers next season. Secondly, I conjectured\r\nthat the Spider and Bee-orchis might be a crossing and self-fertile\r\nform of the same species. Accordingly I wrote some years ago to an\r\nacquaintance, asking him to mark some Spider-orchids, and observe\r\nwhether they retained the same character; but he evidently thought the\r\nrequest as foolish as if I had asked him to mark one of his cows with a\r\nribbon, to see if it would turn next spring into a horse. Now will\r\nyou be so kind as to tie a string round the stem of a half-a-dozen\r\nSpider-orchids, and when you leave Mentone dig them up, and I would try\r\nand cultivate them and see if they kept constant; but I should require\r\nto know in what sort of soil and situations they grow. It would be\r\nindispensable to mark the plant so that there could be no mistake about\r\nthe individual. It is also just possible that the same plant would throw\r\nup, at different seasons different flower-scapes, and the marked plants\r\nwould serve as evidence.\r\n\r\nWith many thanks, my dear sir, Yours sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I send by this post my paper on climbing plants, parts of which\r\nyou might like to read.\r\n\r\n[Sir Thomas Farrer and Dr. W. Ogle were also guided and encouraged by\r\nmy father in their observations. The following refers to a paper by Sir\r\nThomas Farrer, in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History,' 1868, on\r\nthe fertilisation of the Scarlet Runner:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. FARRER. Down, September 15, 1868.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Farrer,\r\n\r\nI grieve to say that the MAIN features of your case are known. I am\r\nthe sinner and described them some ten years ago. But I overlooked\r\nmany details, as the appendage to the single stamen, and several other\r\npoints. I send my notes, but I must beg for their return, as I have NO\r\nOTHER COPY. I quite agree, the facts are most striking, especially\r\nas you put them. Are you sure that the Hive-bee is the cutter? it is\r\nagainst my experience. If sure, make the point more prominent, or if not\r\nsure, erase it. I do not think the subject is quite new enough for the\r\nLinnean Society; but I dare say the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural\r\nHistory,' or \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" would gladly publish your\r\nobservations, and it is a great pity they should be lost. If you like\r\nI would send your paper to either quarter with a note. In this case\r\nyou must give a title, and your name, and perhaps it would be well to\r\npremise your remarks with a line of reference to my paper stating that\r\nyou had observed independently and more fully.\r\n\r\nI have read my own paper over after an interval of several years, and am\r\namused at the caution with which I put the case that the final end\r\nwas for crossing distinct individuals, of which I was then as fully\r\nconvinced as now, but I knew that the doctrine would shock all\r\nbotanists. Now the opinion is becoming familiar.\r\n\r\nTo see penetration of pollen-tubes is not difficult, but in most cases\r\nrequires some practice with dissecting under a one-tenth of an inch\r\nfocal distance single lens; and just at first this will seem to you\r\nextremely difficult.\r\n\r\nWhat a capital observer you are--a first-rate Naturalist has been\r\nsacrificed, or partly sacrificed to Public life.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--If you come across any large Salvia, look at it--the contrivance\r\nis admirable. It went to my heart to tell a man who came here a few\r\nweeks ago with splendid drawings and MS. on Salvia, that the work\r\nhad been all done in Germany. (Dr. W. Ogle, the observer of the\r\nfertilisation of Salvia here alluded to, published his results in the\r\n'Pop. Science Review,' 1869. He refers both gracefully and gratefully to\r\nhis relationship with my father in the introduction to his translation\r\nof Kerner's 'Flowers and their Unbidden Guests.')\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following extract is from a letter, November 26th, 1868, to Sir\r\nThomas Farrer, written as I learn from him, \"in answer to a request for\r\nsome advice as to the best modes of observation.\"\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion the best plan is to go on working and making copious\r\nnotes, without much thought of publication, and then if the results turn\r\nout striking publish them. It is my impression, but I do not feel sure\r\nthat I am right, that the best and most novel plan would be, instead\r\nof describing the means of fertilisation in particular plants, to\r\ninvestigate the part which certain structures play with all plants\r\nor throughout certain orders; for instance, the brush of hairs on the\r\nstyle, or the diadelphous condition of the stamens, in the Leguminosae,\r\nor the hairs within the corolla, etc. etc. Looking to your note, I think\r\nthat this is perhaps the plan which you suggest.\r\n\r\n\"It is well to remember that Naturalists value observations far more\r\nthan reasoning; therefore your conclusions should be as often as\r\npossible fortified by noticing how insects actually do the work.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1869, Sir Thomas Farrer corresponded with my father on the\r\nfertilisation of Passiflora and of Tacsonia. He has given me his\r\nimpressions of the correspondence:--\r\n\r\n\"I had suggested that the elaborate series of chevaux-de-frise, by\r\nwhich the nectary of the common Passiflora is guarded, were specially\r\ncalculated to protect the flower from the stiff-beaked humming birds\r\nwhich would not fertilise it, and to facilitate the access of the little\r\nproboscis of the humble bee, which would do so; whilst, on the other\r\nhand, the long pendent tube and flexible valve-like corona which retains\r\nthe nectar of Tacsonia would shut out the bee, which would not,\r\nand admit the humming bird which would, fertilise that flower. The\r\nsuggestion is very possibly worthless, and could only be verified or\r\nrefuted by examination of flowers in the countries where they grow\r\nnaturally... What interested me was to see that on this as on almost any\r\nother point of detailed observation, Mr. Darwin could always say, 'Yes;\r\nbut at one time I made some observations myself on this particular\r\npoint; and I think you will find, etc. etc.' That he should after years\r\nof interval remember that he had noticed the peculiar structure to which\r\nI was referring in the Passiflora princeps struck me at the time as very\r\nremarkable.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the spread of a belief in the adaptation of flowers for\r\ncross-fertilisation, my father wrote to Mr. Bentham April 22, 1868:\r\n\r\n\"Most of the criticisms which I sometimes meet with in French works\r\nagainst the frequency of crossing, I am certain are the result of mere\r\nignorance. I have never hitherto found the rule to fail that when an\r\nauthor describes the structure of a flower as specially adapted for\r\nself-fertilisation, it is really adapted for crossing. The Fumariaceae\r\noffer a good instance of this, and Treviranus threw this order in my\r\nteeth; but in Corydalis, Hildebrand shows how utterly false the idea\r\nof self-fertilisation is. This author's paper on Salvia is really\r\nworth reading, and I have observed some species, and know that he is\r\naccurate.\"\r\n\r\nThe next letter refers to Professor Hildebrand's paper on Corydalis,\r\npublished in the 'Proc. Internat. Hort. Congress,' London, 1866, and in\r\nPringsheim's 'Jahrbucher,' volume v. The memoir on Salvia alluded to is\r\ncontained in the previous volume of the same Journal:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO F. HILDEBRAND. (Professor of Botany at Freiburg.)\r\nDown, May 16 [1866].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe state of my health prevents my attending the Hort. Congress; but\r\nI forwarded yesterday your paper to the secretary, and if they are not\r\noverwhelmed with papers, yours will be gladly received. I have made many\r\nobservations on the Fumariaceae, and convinced myself that they were\r\nadapted for insect agency; but I never observed anything nearly so\r\ncurious as your most interesting facts. I hope you will repeat your\r\nexperiments on the Corydalis on a larger scale, and especially on\r\nseveral distinct plants; for your plant might have been individually\r\npeculiar, like certain individual plants of Lobelia, etc., described by\r\nGartner, and of Passiflora and Orchids described by Mr. Scott...\r\n\r\nSince writing to you before, I have read your admirable memoir on\r\nSalvia, and it has interested me almost as much as when I first\r\ninvestigated the structure of Orchids. Your paper illustrates several\r\npoints in my 'Origin of Species,' especially the transition of organs.\r\nKnowing only two or three species in the genus, I had often marvelled\r\nhow one cell of the anther could have been transformed into the movable\r\nplate or spoon; and how well you show the gradations; but I am surprised\r\nthat you did not more strongly insist on this point.\r\n\r\nI shall be still more surprised if you do not ultimately come to the\r\nsame belief with me, as shown by so many beautiful contrivances,\r\nthat all plants require, from some unknown cause, to be occasionally\r\nfertilized by pollen from a distinct individual. With sincere respect,\r\nbelieve me, my dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter refers to the late Hermann Muller's 'Befruchtung\r\nder Blumen,' by far the most valuable of the mass of literature\r\noriginating in the 'Fertilisation of Orchids.' An English translation,\r\nby Prof. D'Arcy Thompson was published in 1883. My father's \"Prefatory\r\nNotice\" to this work is dated February 6, 1882, and is therefore almost\r\nthe last of his writings:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO H. MULLER. Down, May 5, 1873.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nOwing to all sorts of interruptions and to my reading German so slowly,\r\nI have read only to page 88 of your book; but I must have the pleasure\r\nof telling you how very valuable a work it appears to me. Independently\r\nof the many original observations, which of course form the most\r\nimportant part, the work will be of the highest use as a means of\r\nreference to all that has been done on the subject. I am fairly\r\nastonished at the number of species of insects, the visits of which to\r\ndifferent flowers you have recorded. You must have worked in the most\r\nindefatigable manner. About half a year ago the editor of 'Nature'\r\nsuggested that it would be a grand undertaking if a number of\r\nnaturalists were to do what you have already done on so large a scale\r\nwith respect to the visits of insects. I have been particularly glad\r\nto read your historical sketch, for I had never before seen all the\r\nreferences put together. I have sometimes feared that I was in\r\nerror when I said that C.K. Sprengel did not fully perceive that\r\ncross-fertilisation was the final end of the structure of flowers;\r\nbut now this fear is relieved, and it is a great satisfaction to me to\r\nbelieve that I have aided in making his excellent book more generally\r\nknown. Nothing has surprised me more than to see in your historical\r\nsketch how much I myself have done on the subject, as it never before\r\noccurred to me to think of all my papers as a whole. But I do not doubt\r\nthat your generous appreciation of the labours of others has led you to\r\nover-estimate what I have done. With very sincere thanks and respect,\r\nbelieve me,\r\n\r\nYours faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have mentioned your book to almost every one who, as far as I\r\nknow, cares for the subject in England; and I have ordered a copy to be\r\nsend to our Royal Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The next letter, to Dr. Behrens, refers to the same subject as the\r\nlast:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W. BEHRENS. Down, August 29 [1878].\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged to you for having sent me your 'Geschichte der\r\nBestaubungs-Theorie' (Progr. der K. Gewerbschule zu Elberfeld, 1877,\r\n1878.), and which has interested me much. It has put some things in a\r\nnew light, and has told me other things which I did not know. I heartily\r\nagree with you in your high appreciation of poor old C. Sprengel's work;\r\nand one regrets bitterly that he did not live to see his labours thus\r\nvalued. It rejoices me also to notice how highly you appreciate H.\r\nMuller, who has always seemed to me an admirable observer and reasoner.\r\nI am at present endeavouring to persuade an English publisher to bring\r\nout a translation of his 'Befruchtung.'\r\n\r\nLastly, permit me to thank you for your very generous remarks on\r\nmy works. By placing what I have been able to do on this subject in\r\nsystematic order, you have made me think more highly of my own work than\r\nI ever did before! Nevertheless, I fear that you have done me more than\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nI remain, dear Sir, yours faithfully and obliged, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The letter which follows was called forth by Dr. Gray's article in\r\n'Nature,' to which reference has already been made, and which appeared\r\nJune 4, 1874:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, June 3 [1874].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI was rejoiced to see your hand-writing again in your note of the 4th,\r\nof which more anon. I was astonished to see announced about a week ago\r\nthat you were going to write in 'Nature' an article on me, and this\r\nmorning I received an advance copy. It is the grandest thing ever\r\nwritten about me, especially as coming from a man like yourself. It\r\nhas deeply pleased me, particularly some of your side remarks. It is a\r\nwonderful thing to me to live to see my name coupled in any fashion with\r\nthat of Robert Brown. But you are a bold man, for I am sure that you\r\nwill be sneered at by not a few botanists. I have never been so honoured\r\nbefore, and I hope it will do me good and make me try to be as careful\r\nas possible; and good heavens, how difficult accuracy is! I feel a very\r\nproud man, but I hope this won't last...\r\n\r\n\r\n[Fritz Muller has observed that the flowers of Hedychium are so arranged\r\nthat the pollen is removed by the wings of hovering butterflies. My\r\nfather's prediction of this observation is given in the following\r\nletter:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO H. MULLER. Down, August 7, 1876.\r\n\r\n... I was much interested by your brother's article on Hedychium; about\r\ntwo years ago I was so convinced that the flowers were fertilized by the\r\ntips of the wings of large moths, that I wrote to India to ask a man to\r\nobserve the flowers and catch the moths at work, and he sent me 20 to 30\r\nSphin-moths, but so badly packed that they all arrived in fragments; and\r\nI could make out nothing...\r\n\r\nYours sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following extract from a letter (February 25, 1864), to Dr. Gray\r\nrefers to another prediction fulfilled:--\r\n\r\n\"I have of course seen no one, and except good dear Hooker, I hear from\r\nno one. He, like a good and true friend, though so overworked, often\r\nwrites to me.\r\n\r\n\"I have had one letter which has interested me greatly, with a paper,\r\nwhich will appear in the Linnean Journal, by Dr. Cruger of Trinidad,\r\nwhich shows that I am all right about Catasetum, even to the spot where\r\nthe pollinia adhere to the bees, which visit the flower, as I said, to\r\ngnaw the labellum. Cruger's account of Coryanthes and the use of the\r\nbucket-like labellum full of water beats everything: I SUSPECT that the\r\nbees being well wetted flattens their hairs, and allows the viscid disc\r\nto adhere.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO THE MARQUIS DE SAPORTA. Down, December 24, 1877.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your long and most interesting letter, which I\r\nshould have answered sooner had it not been delayed in London. I had not\r\nheard before that I was to be proposed as a Corresponding Member of the\r\nInstitute. Living so retired a life as I do, such honours affect me very\r\nlittle, and I can say with entire truth that your kind expression of\r\nsympathy has given and will give me much more pleasure than the election\r\nitself, should I be elected.\r\n\r\nYour idea that dicotyledonous plants were not developed in force until\r\nsucking insects had been evolved seems to me a splendid one. I am\r\nsurprised that the idea never occurred to me, but this is always\r\nthe case when one first hears a new and simple explanation of some\r\nmysterious phenomenon... I formerly showed that we might fairly assume\r\nthat the beauty of flowers, their sweet odour and copious nectar, may be\r\nattributed to the existence of flower-haunting insects, but your idea,\r\nwhich I hope you will publish, goes much further and is much more\r\nimportant. With respect to the great development of mammifers in the\r\nlater Geological periods following from the development of dicotyledons,\r\nI think it ought to be proved that such animals as deer, cows, horses,\r\netc. could not flourish if fed exclusively on the gramineae and other\r\nanemophilous monocotyledons; and I do not suppose that any evidence on\r\nthis head exists.\r\n\r\nYour suggestion of studying the manner of fertilisation of the surviving\r\nmembers of the most ancient forms of the dicotyledons is a very good\r\none, and I hope that you will keep it in mind yourself, for I have\r\nturned my attention to other subjects. Delpino I think says that\r\nMagnolia is fertilised by insects which gnaw the petals, and I should\r\nnot be surprised if the same fact holds good with Nymphaea. Whenever I\r\nhave looked at the flowers of these latter plants I have felt inclined\r\nto admit the view that petals are modified stamens, and not modified\r\nleaves; though Poinsettia seems to show that true leaves might be\r\nconverted into coloured petals. I grieve to say that I have never\r\nbeen properly grounded in Botany and have studied only special\r\npoints--therefore I cannot pretend to express any opinion on your\r\nremarks on the origin of the flowers of the Coniferae, Gnetaceae, etc.;\r\nbut I have been delighted with what you say on the conversion of a\r\nmonoecious species into a hermaphrodite one by the condensations of the\r\nverticils on a branch bearing female flowers near the summit, and male\r\nflowers below.\r\n\r\nI expect Hooker to come here before long, and I will then show him your\r\ndrawing, and if he makes any important remarks I will communicate\r\nwith you. He is very busy at present in clearing off arrears after his\r\nAmerican Expedition, so that I do not like to trouble him, even with the\r\nbriefest note. I am at present working with my son at some Physiological\r\nsubjects, and we are arriving at very curious results, but they are not\r\nas yet sufficiently certain to be worth communicating to you...\r\n\r\n\r\n[In 1877 a second edition of the 'Fertilisation of Orchids' was\r\npublished, the first edition having been for some time out of print. The\r\nnew edition was remodelled and almost re-written, and a large amount\r\nof new matter added, much of which the author owed to his friend Fritz\r\nMuller.\r\n\r\nWith regard to this edition he wrote to Dr. Gray:--\r\n\r\n\"I do not suppose I shall ever again touch the book. After much doubt I\r\nhave resolved to act in this way with all my books for the future; that\r\nis to correct them once and never touch them again, so as to use the\r\nsmall quantity of work left in me for new matter.\"\r\n\r\nHe may have felt a diminution of his powers of reviewing large bodies of\r\nfacts, such as would be needed in the preparation of new editions, but\r\nhis powers of observation were certainly not diminished. He wrote to Mr.\r\nDyer on July 14, 1878:]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Dyer,\r\n\r\nThalia dealbata was sent me from Kew: it has flowered and after looking\r\ncasually at the flowers, they have driven me almost mad, and I have\r\nworked at them for a week: it is as grand a case as that of Catasetum.\r\n\r\nPistil vigorously motile (so that whole flower shakes when pistil\r\nsuddenly coils up); when excited by a touch the two filaments [are]\r\nproduced laterally and transversely across the flower (just over the\r\nnectar) from one of the petals or modified stamens. It is splendid to\r\nwatch the phenomenon under a weak power when a bristle is inserted into\r\na YOUNG flower which no insect has visited. As far as I know Stylidium\r\nis the sole case of sensitive pistil and here it is the pistil +\r\nstamens. In Thalia (Hildebrand has described an explosive arrangement\r\nin some of the Maranteae--the tribe to which Thalia belongs.)\r\ncross-fertilisation is ensured by the wonderful movement, if bees visit\r\nseveral flowers.\r\n\r\nI have now relieved my mind and will tell the purport of this note--viz.\r\nif any other species of Thalia besides T. dealbata should flower with\r\nyou, for the love of heaven and all the saints, send me a few in TIN BOX\r\nWITH DAMP MOSS.\r\n\r\nYour insane friend, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In 1878 Dr. Ogle's translation of Kerner's interesting book, 'Flowers\r\nand their Unbidden Guests,' was published. My father, who felt much\r\ninterest in the translation (as appears in the following letter),\r\ncontributed some prefatory words of approval:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W. OGLE. Down, December 16 [1878].\r\n\r\n... I have now read Kerner's book, which is better even than I\r\nanticipated. The translation seems to me as clear as daylight, and\r\nwritten in forcible and good familiar English. I am rather afraid that\r\nit is too good for the English public, which seems to like very washy\r\nfood, unless it be administered by some one whose name is well-known,\r\nand then I suspect a good deal of the unintelligible is very pleasing\r\nto them. I hope to heaven that I may be wrong. Anyhow, you and Mrs.\r\nOgle have done a right good service for Botanical Science. Yours very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--You have done me much honour in your prefatory remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[One of the latest references to his Orchid-work occurs in a letter to\r\nMr. Bentham, February 16, 1880. It shows the amount of pleasure which\r\nthis subject gave to my father, and (what is characteristic of him)\r\nthat his reminiscence of the work was one of delight in the observations\r\nwhich preceded its publication. Not to the applause which followed it:--\r\n\r\n\"They are wonderful creatures, these Orchids, and I sometimes think\r\nwith a glow of pleasure, when I remember making out some little point in\r\ntheir method of fertilisation.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.XI. -- THE 'EFFECTS OF CROSS- AND SELF-FERTILISATION\r\n\r\nIN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM.'\r\n\r\n1876.\r\n\r\n[This book, as pointed out in the 'Autobiography,' is a complement to\r\nthe 'Fertilisation of Orchids,' because it shows how important are\r\nthe results of cross-fertilisation which are ensured by the mechanisms\r\ndescribed in that book.\r\n\r\nBy proving that the offspring of cross-fertilisation are more\r\nvigorous than the offspring of self-fertilisation, he showed that one\r\ncircumstance which influences the fate of young plants in the\r\nstruggle for life is the degree to which their parents are fitted for\r\ncross-fertilisation. He thus convinced himself that the intensity of the\r\nstruggle (which he had elsewhere shown to exist among young plants) is\r\na measure of the strength of a selective agency perpetually sifting\r\nout every modification in the structure of flowers which can effect its\r\ncapabilities for cros-fertilisation.\r\n\r\nThe book is also valuable in another respect, because it throws light on\r\nthe difficult problems of the origin of sexuality. The increased vigour\r\nresulting from cross-fertilisation is allied in the closest manner to\r\nthe advantage gained by change of conditions. So strongly is this the\r\ncase, that in some instances cross-fertilisation gives no advantage to\r\nthe offspring, unless the parents have lived under slightly different\r\nconditions. So that the really important thing is not that two\r\nindividuals of different BLOOD shall unite, but two individuals which\r\nhave been subjected to different conditions. We are thus led to believe\r\nthat sexuality is a means for infusing vigour into the offspring by the\r\ncoalescence of differentiated elements, an advantage which could not\r\nfollow if reproductions were entirely asexual.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that this book, the result of eleven years of\r\nexperimental work, owed its origin to a chance observation. My father\r\nhad raised two beds of Linaria vulgaris--one set being the offspring of\r\ncross- and the other of self-fertilisation. These plants were grown for\r\nthe sake of some observations on inheritance, and not with any view to\r\ncross-breeding, and he was astonished to observe that the offspring of\r\nself-fertilisation were clearly less vigorous than the others. It seemed\r\nincredible to him that this result could be due to a single act of\r\nself-fertilisation, and it was only in the following year when precisely\r\nthe same result occurred in the case of a similar experiment on\r\ninheritance in Carnations, that his attention was \"thoroughly aroused\"\r\nand that he determined to make a series of experiments specially\r\ndirected to the question. The following letters give some account of the\r\nwork in question.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. September 10, [1866?].\r\n\r\n... I have just begun a large course of experiments on the germination\r\nof the seed, and on the growth of the young plants when raised from a\r\npistil fertilised by pollen from the same flower, and from pollen from\r\na distinct plant of the same, or of some other variety. I have not\r\nmade sufficient experiments to judge certainly, but in some cases the\r\ndifference in the growth of the young plants is highly remarkable. I\r\nhave taken every kind of precaution in getting seed from the same\r\nplant, in germinating the seed on my own chimney-piece, in planting the\r\nseedlings in the same flower-pot, and under this similar treatment I\r\nhave seen the young seedlings from the crossed seed exactly twice as\r\ntall as the seedlings from the sel-fertilised seed; both seeds having\r\ngerminated on the same day. If I can establish this fact (but perhaps it\r\nwill all go to the dogs), in some fifty cases, with plants of different\r\norders, I think it will be very important, for then we shall positively\r\nknow why the structure of every flower permits, or favours, or\r\nnecessitates an occasional cross with a distinct individual. But all\r\nthis is rather cooking my hare before I have caught it. But somehow it\r\nis a great pleasure to me to tell you what I am about. Believe me, my\r\ndear Gray,\r\n\r\nEver yours most truly, and with cordial thanks, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO G. BENTHAM. April 22, 1868.\r\n\r\n... I am experimenting on a very large scale on the difference in power\r\nof growth between plants raised from self-fertilised and crossed seeds;\r\nand it is no exaggeration to say that the difference in growth and\r\nvigour is sometimes truly wonderful. Lyell, Huxley and Hooker have seen\r\nsome of my plants, and been astonished; and I should much like to show\r\nthem to you. I always supposed until lately that no evil effects would\r\nbe visible until after several generations of self-fertilisation; but\r\nnow I see that one generation sometimes suffices; and the existence of\r\ndimorphic plants and all the wonderful contrivances of orchids are quite\r\nintelligible to me.\r\n\r\nWith cordial thanks for your letter, which has pleased me greatly,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[An extract from a letter to Dr. Gray (March 11, 1873) mentions the\r\nprogress of the work:--\r\n\r\n\"I worked last summer hard at Drosera, but could not finish till I\r\ngot fresh plants, and consequently took up the effects of crossing and\r\nsel-fertilising plants, and am got so interested that Drosera must go to\r\nthe dogs till I finish with this, and get it published; but then I will\r\nresume my beloved Drosera, and I heartily apologise for having sent the\r\nprecious little things even for a moment to the dogs.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letters give the author's impression of his own book.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.

I do not know\r\nwhat to advise. The greater part of the book is extremely dry, and the\r\nwhole on a special subject. Nevertheless, I am convinced that the book\r\nis of value, and I am convinced that for MANY years copies will be\r\noccasionally sold. Judging from the sale of my former books, and from\r\nsupposing that some persons will purchase it to complete the set of\r\nmy works, I would suggest 1500.

Down, September 27, 1876.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI sent by this morning's post the four first perfect sheets of my new\r\nbook, the title of which you will see on the first page, and which will\r\nbe published early in November.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that it is only shorter by a few pages than my\r\n'Insectivorous Plants.' The whole is now in type, though I have\r\ncorrected finally only half the volume. You will, therefore, rapidly\r\nreceive the remainder. The book is very dull. Chapters II. to VI.,\r\ninclusive, are simply a record of experiments. Nevertheless, I believe\r\n(though a man can never judge his own books) that the book is valuable.\r\nYou will have to decide whether it is worth translating. I hope so. It\r\nhas cost me very great labour, and the results seem to me remarkable and\r\nwell established.\r\n\r\nIf you translate it, you could easily get aid for Chapters II. to VI.,\r\nas there is here endless, but I have thought necessary repetition. I\r\nshall be anxious to hear what you decide...\r\n\r\nI most sincerely hope that your health has been fairly good this summer.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, yours very truly, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, October 28, 1876.\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI send by this post all the clean sheets as yet printed, and I hope to\r\nsend the remainder within a fortnight. Please observe that the first six\r\nchapters are not readable, and the six last very dull. Still I believe\r\nthat the results are valuable. If you review the book, I shall be very\r\ncurious to see what you think of it, for I care more for your judgment\r\nthan for that of almost any one else. I know also that you will speak\r\nthe truth, whether you approve or disapprove. Very few will take the\r\ntrouble to read the book, and I do not expect you to read the whole, but\r\nI hope you will read the latter chapters.\r\n\r\n... I am so sick of correcting the press and licking my horrid bad style\r\ninto intelligible English.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The 'Effects of Cross and Self-fertilisation' was published on November\r\n10, 1876, and 1500 copies were sold before the end of the year.

Down, February 16, 1877.\r\n\r\nDear Dyer,\r\n\r\nI must tell you how greatly I am pleased and honoured by your article in\r\n'Nature,' which I have just read. You are an adept in saying what\r\nwill please an author, not that I suppose you wrote with this express\r\nintention. I should be very well contented to deserve a fraction of your\r\npraise. I have also been much interested, and this is better than mere\r\npleasure, by your argument about the separation of the sexes. I dare\r\nsay that I am wrong, and will hereafter consider what you say more\r\ncarefully: but at present I cannot drive out of my head that the sexes\r\nmust have originated from two individuals, slightly different, which\r\nconjugated. But I am aware that some cases of conjugation are opposed to\r\nany such views.\r\n\r\nWith hearty thanks, Yours sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.XII. -- 'DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLOWERS ON PLANTS OF THE SAME SPECIES.'\r\n\r\n1877.\r\n\r\n[The volume bearing the above title was published in 1877, and was\r\ndedicated by the author to Professor Asa Gray, \"as a small tribute of\r\nrespect and affection.\" It consists of certain earlier papers re-edited,\r\nwith the addition of a quantity of new matter. The subjects treated in\r\nthe book are:--\r\n\r\n1. Heterostyled Plants.\r\n\r\n2. Polygamous, Dioecious, and Gynodioecious Plants.\r\n\r\n3. Cleistogamic Flowers.\r\n\r\nThe nature of heterostyled plants may be illustrated in the primrose,\r\none of the best known examples of the class. If a number of primroses be\r\ngathered, it will be found that some plants yield nothing but \"pin-eyed\"\r\nflowers, in which the style (or organ for the transmission of the pollen\r\nto the ovule) is long, while the others yield only \"thrum-eyed\" flowers\r\nwith short styles. Thus primroses are divided into two sets or castes\r\ndiffering structurally from each other. My father showed that they also\r\ndiffer sexually, and that in fact the bond between the two castes\r\nmore nearly resembles that between separate sexes than any other known\r\nrelationship. Thus for example a long-styled primrose, though it can\r\nbe fertilised by its own pollen, is not FULLY fertile unless it is\r\nimpregnated by the pollen of a short-styled flower. Heterostyled plants\r\nare comparable to hermaphrodite animals, such as snails, which require\r\nthe concourse of two individuals, although each possesses both the\r\nsexual elements. The difference is that in the case of the primrose\r\nit is PERFECT FERTILITY, and not simply FERTILITY, that depends on the\r\nmutual action of the two sets of individuals.\r\n\r\nThe work on heterostyled plants has a special bearing, to which the\r\nauthor attached much importance, on the problem of origin of species.\r\n(See 'Autobiography,' volume i.)\r\n\r\nHe found that a wonderfully close parallelism exists between\r\nhybridisation and certain forms of fertilisation among heterostyled\r\nplants. So that it is hardly an exaggeration to say that the\r\n\"illegitimately\" reared seedlings are hybrids, although both their\r\nparents belong to identically the same species. In a letter to Professor\r\nHuxley, my father writes as if his researches on heterostyled plants\r\ntended to make him believe that sterility is a selected or acquired\r\nquality. But in his later publications, e.g. in the sixth edition of\r\nthe 'Origin,' he adheres to the belief that sterility is an incidental\r\nrather than a selected quality. The result of his work on heterostyled\r\nplants is of importance as showing that sterility is no test of specific\r\ndistinctness, and that it depends on differentiation of the sexual\r\nelements which is independent of any racial difference. I imagine that\r\nit was his instinctive love of making out a difficulty which to a great\r\nextent kept him at work so patiently on the heterostyled plants. But it\r\nwas the fact that general conclusions of the above character could\r\nbe drawn from his results which made him think his results worthy of\r\npublication. (See 'Forms of Flowers,' page 243.)\r\n\r\nThe papers which on this subject preceded and contributed to 'Forms of\r\nFlowers' were the following:--\r\n\r\n\"On the two Forms or Dimorphic Condition in the Species of Primula, and\r\non their remarkable Sexual Relations.\" Linn. Soc. Journal, 1862.)\r\n\r\n\"On the Existence of Two Forms, and on their Reciprocal Sexual\r\nRelations, in several Species of the Genus Linum.\" Linn. Soc. Journal,\r\n1863.\r\n\r\n\"On the Sexual Relations of the Three Forms of Lythrum salicaria,\" Ibid.\r\n1864.\r\n\r\n\"On the Character and Hybrid-like Nature of the Offspring from the\r\nIllegitimate Unions of Dimorphic and Trimorphic Plants.\" Ibid. 1869.\r\n\r\n\"On the Specific Differences between Primula veris, Brit.

HOOKER. Down, May 7 [1860].\r\n\r\n... I have this morning been looking at my experimental cowslips, and I\r\nfind some plants have all flowers with long stamens and short pistils,\r\nwhich I will call \"male plants,\" others with short stamens and long\r\npistils, which I will call \"female plants.\" This I have somewhere seen\r\nnoticed, I think by Henslow; but I find (after looking at my two sets\r\nof plants) that the stigmas of the male and female are of slightly\r\ndifferent shape, and certainly different degree of roughness, and what\r\nhas astonished me, the pollen of the so-called female plant, though very\r\nabundant, is more transparent, and each granule is exactly only 2/3\r\nof the size of the pollen of the so-called male plant. Has this been\r\nobserved? I cannot help suspecting [that] the cowslip is in fact\r\ndioecious, but it may turn out all a blunder, but anyhow I will mark\r\nwith sticks the so-called male and female plants and watch their\r\nseeding. It would be a fine case of gradation between an hermaphrodite\r\nand unisexual condition. Likewise a sort of case of balancement of\r\nlong and short pistils and stamens. Likewise perhaps throws light on\r\noxlips...\r\n\r\nI have now examined primroses and find exactly the same difference\r\nin the size of the pollen, correlated with the same difference in the\r\nlength of the style and roughness of the stigmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. June 8 [1860].\r\n\r\n... I have been making some little trifling observations which have\r\ninterested and perplexed me much. I find with primroses and cowslips,\r\nthat about an equal number of plants are thus characterised.\r\n\r\nSO-CALLED (by me) MALE plant. Pistil much shorter than stamens; stigma\r\nrather smooth,--POLLEN GRAINS LARGE, throat of corolla short.\r\n\r\nSO-CALLED FEMALE plant. Pistil much longer than stamens, stigma rougher,\r\nPOLLEN-GRAINS SMALLER,--throat of corolla long.\r\n\r\nI have marked a lot of plants, and expected to find the so-called male\r\nplant barren; but judging from the feel of the capsules, this is not the\r\ncase, and I am very much surprised at the difference in the size of the\r\npollen... If it should prove that the so-called male plants produce less\r\nseed than the so-called females, what a beautiful case of gradation from\r\nhermaphrodite to unisexual condition it will be! If they produce about\r\nequal number of seed, how perplexing it will be.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 17 [1860?].\r\n\r\n... I have just been ordering a photograph of myself for a friend; and\r\nhave ordered one for you, and for heaven's sake oblige me, and burn that\r\nnow hanging up in your room.--It makes me look atrociously wicked.\r\n\r\n... In the spring I must get you to look for long pistils and short\r\npistils in the rarer species of Primula and in some allied Genera. It\r\nholds with P. Sinensis. You remember all the fuss I made on this subject\r\nlast spring; well, the other day at last I had time to weigh the seeds,\r\nand by Jove the plants of primroses and cowslip with short pistils and\r\nlarge grained pollen (Thus the plants which he imagined to be tending\r\ntowards a male condition were more productive than the supposed\r\nfemales.) are rather more fertile than those with long pistils, and\r\nsmall-grained pollen. I find that they require the action of insects to\r\nset them, and I never will believe that these differences are without\r\nsome meaning.\r\n\r\nSome of my experiments lead me to suspect that the large-grained pollen\r\nsuits the long pistils and the small-grained pollen suits the short\r\npistils; but I am determined to see if I cannot make out the mystery\r\nnext spring.\r\n\r\nHow does your book on plants brew in your mind? Have you begun it?...\r\n\r\nRemember me most kindly to Oliver. He must be astonished at not having a\r\nstring of questions, I fear he will get out of practice!\r\n\r\n\r\n[The Primula-work was finished in the autumn of 1861, and on November\r\n8th he wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"I have sent my paper on dimorphism in Primula to the Linn. Soc. I\r\nshall go up and read it whenever it comes on; I hope you may be able to\r\nattend, for I do not suppose many will care a penny for the subject.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the reading of the paper (on November 21st), he wrote to\r\nthe same friend:--\r\n\r\n\"I by no means thought that I produced a \"tremendous effect\" in the\r\nLinn. Soc., but by Jove the Linn. Soc. produced a tremendous effect on\r\nme, for I could not get out of bed till late next evening, so that I\r\njust crawled home. I fear I must give up trying to read any paper or\r\nspeak; it is a horrid bore, I can do nothing like other people.\"\r\n\r\nTo Dr. Gray he wrote, (December 1861):--\r\n\r\n\"You may rely on it, I will send you a copy of my Primula paper as soon\r\nas I can get one; but I believe it will not be printed till April 1st,\r\nand therefore after my Orchid Book. I care more for your and Hooker's\r\nopinion than for that of all the rest of the world, and for Lyell's\r\non geological points. Bentham and Hooker thought well of my paper when\r\nread; but no one can judge of evidence by merely hearing a paper.\"\r\n\r\nThe work on Primula was the means of bringing my father in contact\r\nwith the late Mr. John Scott, then working as a gardener in the Botanic\r\nGardens at Edinburgh,--an employment which he seems to have chosen in\r\norder to gratify his passion for natural history. He wrote one or two\r\nexcellent botanical papers, and ultimately obtained a post in India.\r\n(While in India he made some admirable observations on expression for my\r\nfather.) He died in 1880.\r\n\r\nA few phrases may be quoted from letters to Sir J.D. Hooker, showing my\r\nfather's estimate of Scott:--\r\n\r\n\"If you know, do please tell me who is John Scott of the Botanical\r\nGardens of Edinburgh; I have been corresponding largely with him; he is\r\nno common man.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he had leisure he would make a wonderful observer; to my judgment I\r\nhave come across no one like him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has interested me strangely, and I have formed a very high opinion\r\nof his intellect. I hope he will accept pecuniary assistance from me;\r\nbut he has hitherto refused.\" (He ultimately succeeded in being allowed\r\nto pay for Mr. Scott's passage to India.)\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing of him excepting from his letters; these show remarkable\r\ntalent, astonishing perseverance, much modesty, and what I admire,\r\ndetermined difference from me on many points.\"\r\n\r\nSo highly did he estimate Scott's abilities that he formed a plan (which\r\nhowever never went beyond an early stage of discussion) of employing him\r\nto work out certain problems connected with intercrossing.\r\n\r\nThe following letter refers to my father's investigations on Lythrum (He\r\nwas led to this, his first case of trimorphism by Lecoq's 'Geographie\r\nBotanique,' and this must have consoled him for the trick this work\r\nplayed him in turning out to be so much larger than he expected. He\r\nwrote to Sir J.D. Hooker: \"Here is a good joke: I saw an extract from\r\nLecoq, 'Geograph. Bot.,' and ordered it and hoped that it was a good\r\nsized pamphlet, and nine thick volumes have arrived!\"), a plant which\r\nreveals even a more wonderful condition of sexual complexity than that\r\nof Primula. For in Lythrum there are not merely two, but three castes,\r\ndiffering structurally and physiologically from each other:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, August 9 [1862].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nIt is late at night, and I am going to write briefly, and of course to\r\nbeg a favour.\r\n\r\nThe Mitchella very good, but pollen apparently equal-sized. I have just\r\nexamined Hottonia, grand difference in pollen. Echium vulgare, a humbug,\r\nmerely a case like Thymus. But I am almost stark staring mad over\r\nLythrum (On another occasion he wrote (to Dr. Gray) with regard to\r\nLythrum: \"I must hold hard, otherwise I shall spend my life over\r\ndimorphism.\"); if I can prove what I fully believe, it is a grand case\r\nof TRIMORPHISM, with three different pollens and three stigmas; I have\r\ncastrated and fertilised above ninety flowers, trying all the eighteen\r\ndistinct crosses which are possible within the limits of this one\r\nspecies! I cannot explain, but I feel sure you would think it a grand\r\ncase. I have been writing to Botanists to see if I can possibly get L.\r\nhyssopifolia, and it has just flashed on me that you might have Lythrum\r\nin North America, and I have looked to your Manual. For the love of\r\nheaven have a look at some of your species, and if you can get me seed,\r\ndo; I want much to try species with few stamens, if they are dimorphic;\r\nNesaea verticillata I should expect to be trimorphic. Seed! Seed! Seed!\r\nI should rather like seed of Mitchella. But oh, Lythrum!\r\n\r\nYour utterly mad friend, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--There is reason in my madness, for I can see that to those who\r\nalready believe in change of species, these facts will modify to a\r\ncertain extent the whole view of Hybridity. (A letter to Dr. Gray (July,\r\n1862) bears on this point: \"A few days ago I made an observation which\r\nhas surprised me more than it ought to do--it will have to be repeated\r\nseveral times, but I have scarcely a doubt of its accuracy. I stated\r\nin my Primula paper that the long-styled form of Linum grandiflorum\r\nwas utterly sterile with its own pollen; I have lately been putting the\r\npollen of the two forms on the stigma of the SAME flower; and it strikes\r\nme as truly wonderful, that the stigma distinguishes the pollen; and is\r\npenetrated by the tubes of the one and not by those of the other; nor\r\nare the tubes exserted. Or (which is the same thing) the stigma of the\r\none form acts on and is acted on by pollen, which produces not the\r\nleast effect on the stigma of the other form. Taking sexual power as the\r\ncriterion of difference, the two forms of this one species may be said\r\nto be generically distinct.\")\r\n\r\n\r\n[On the same subject he wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker in August 1862:--\r\n\r\n\"Is Oliver at Kew? When I am established at Bournemouth I am completely\r\nmad to examine any fresh flowers of any Lythraceous plant, and I would\r\nwrite and ask him if any are in bloom.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he wrote to the same friend in October:--\r\n\r\n\"If you ask Oliver, I think he will tell you I have got a real odd case\r\nin Lythrum, it interests me extremely, and seems to me the strangest\r\ncase of propagation recorded amongst plants or animals, viz. a necessary\r\ntriple alliance between three hermaphrodites. I feel sure I can now\r\nprove the truth of the case from a multitude of crosses made this\r\nsummer.\"\r\n\r\nIn an article, 'Dimorphism in the Genitalia of Plants' ('Silliman's\r\nJournal,' 1862, volume xxxiv. page 419), Dr. Gray pointed out that the\r\nstructural difference between the two forms of Primula had already been\r\ndefined in the 'Flora of North America,' as DIOECIO-DIMORPHISM. The\r\nuse of this term called forth the following remarks from my father. The\r\nletter also alludes to a review of the 'Fertilisation of Orchids' in the\r\nsame volume of 'Silliman's Journal.']\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, November 26 [1862].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nThe very day after my last letter, yours of November 10th, and the\r\nreview in 'Silliman,' which I feared might have been lost, reached me.\r\nWe were all very much interested by the political part of your letter;\r\nand in some odd way one never feels that information and opinions\r\npainted in a newspaper come from a living source; they seem dead,\r\nwhereas all that you write is full of life. The reviews interested me\r\nprofoundly; you rashly ask for my opinion, and you must consequently\r\nendure a long letter. First for Dimorphism; I do not AT PRESENT like the\r\nterm \"Dioecio-dimorphism;\" for I think it gives quite a false notion,\r\nthat the phenomena are connected with a separation of the sexes.\r\nCertainly in Primula there is unequal fertility in the two forms, and I\r\nsuspect this is the case with Linum; and, therefore I felt bound in\r\nthe Primula paper to state that it might be a step towards a dioecious\r\ncondition; though I believe there are no dioecious forms in Primulaceae\r\nor Linaceae. But the three forms in Lythrum convince me that the\r\nphenomenon is in no way necessarily connected with any tendency to\r\nseparation of sexes. The case seems to me in result or function to be\r\nalmost identical with what old C.K. Sprengel called \"dichogamy,\" and\r\nwhich is so frequent in truly hermaphrodite groups; namely, the pollen\r\nand stigma of each flower being mature at different periods. If I am\r\nright, it is very advisable not to use the term \"dioecious,\" as this at\r\nonce brings notions of separation of sexes.\r\n\r\n... I was much perplexed by Oliver's remarks in the 'Natural History\r\nReview' on the Primula case, on the lower plants having sexes more often\r\nseparated than in the higher plants,--so exactly the reverse of what\r\ntakes place in animals. Hooker in his review of the 'Orchids' repeats\r\nthis remark. There seems to be much truth in what you say (\"Forms which\r\nare low in the scale as respects morphological completeness may be\r\nhigh in the scale of rank founded on specialisation of structure and\r\nfunction.\"--Dr. Gray, in 'Silliman's Journal.'), and it did not occur to\r\nme, about no improbability of specialisation in CERTAIN lines in lowly\r\norganised beings. I could hardly doubt that the hermaphrodite state is\r\nthe aboriginal one. But how is it in the conjugation of Confervae--is\r\nnot one of the two individuals here in fact male, and the other female?\r\nI have been much puzzled by this contrast in sexual arrangements\r\nbetween plants and animals. Can there be anything in the following\r\nconsideration: By ROUGHEST calculation about one-third of the British\r\nGENERA of aquatic plants belong to the Linnean classes of Mono and\r\nDioecia; whilst of terrestrial plants (the aquatic genera being\r\nsubtracted) only one-thirteenth of the genera belong to these two\r\nclasses. Is there any truth in this fact generally? Can aquatic plants,\r\nbeing confined to a small area or small community of individuals,\r\nrequire more free crossing, and therefore have separate sexes? But to\r\nreturn to our point, does not Alph. de Candolle say that aquatic plants\r\ntaken as a whole are lowly organised, compared with terrestrial; and may\r\nnot Oliver's remark on the separation of the sexes in lowly organised\r\nplants stand in some relation to their being frequently aquatic? Or is\r\nthis all rubbish?\r\n\r\n... What a magnificent compliment you end your review with! You and\r\nHooker seem determined to turn my head with conceit and vanity (if not\r\nalready turned) and make me an unbearable wretch.\r\n\r\nWith most cordial thanks, my good and kind friend, Farewell, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following passage from a letter (July 28, 1863), to Prof.\r\nHildebrand, contains a reference to the reception of the dimorphic work\r\nin France:--\r\n\r\n\"I am extremely much pleased to hear that you have been looking at the\r\nmanner of fertilisation of your native Orchids, and still more pleased\r\nto hear that you have been experimenting on Linum. I much hope that you\r\nmay publish the result of these experiments; because I was told that the\r\nmost eminent French botanists of Paris said that my paper on Primula was\r\nthe work of imagination, and that the case was so improbable they did\r\nnot believe in my results.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. April 19 [1864].\r\n\r\n... I received a little time ago a paper with a good account of your\r\nHerbarium and Library, and a long time previously your excellent review\r\nof Scott's 'Primulaceae,' and I forwarded it to him in India, as it\r\nwould much please him. I was very glad to see in it a new case of\r\nDimorphism (I forget just now the name of the plant); I shall be\r\ngrateful to hear of any other cases, as I still feel an interest in\r\nthe subject. I should be very glad to get some seed of your dimorphic\r\nPlantagos; for I cannot banish the suspicion that they must belong to a\r\nvery different class like that of the common Thyme. (In this prediction\r\nhe was right. See 'Forms of Flowers,' page 307.) How could the\r\nwind, which is the agent of fertilisation, with Plantago, fertilise\r\n\"reciprocally dimorphic\" flowers like Primula? Theory says this cannot\r\nbe, and in such cases of one's own theories I follow Agassiz and\r\ndeclare, \"that nature never lies.\" I should even be very glad to examine\r\nthe two dried forms of Plantago. Indeed, any dried dimorphic plants\r\nwould be gratefully received...\r\n\r\nDid my Lythrum paper interest you? I crawl on at the rate of two hours\r\nper diem, with 'Variation under Domestication.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 26 [1864].\r\n\r\n... You do not know how pleased I am that you have read my Lythrum paper;\r\nI thought you would not have time, and I have for long years looked at\r\nyou as my Public, and care more for your opinion than that of all the\r\nrest of the world. I have done nothing which has interested me so much\r\nas Lythrum, since making out the complemental males of Cirripedes.\r\nI fear that I have dragged in too much miscellaneous matter into the\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n... I get letters occasionally, which show me that Natural Selection is\r\nmaking GREAT progress in Germany, and some amongst the young in France.\r\nI have just received a pamphlet from Germany, with the complimentary\r\ntitle of \"Darwinische Arten-Enstehung-Humbug\"!\r\n\r\nFarewell, my best of old friends, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. September 10, [1867?].\r\n\r\n... The only point which I have made out this summer, which could\r\npossibly interest you, is that the common Oxlip found everywhere, more\r\nor less commonly in England, is certainly a hybrid between the primrose\r\nand cowslip; whilst the P. elatior (Jacq.), found only in the\r\nEastern Counties, is a perfectly distinct and good species; hardly\r\ndistinguishable from the common oxlip, except by the length of the\r\nseed-capsule relatively to the calyx. This seems to me rather a horrid\r\nfact for all systematic botanists...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO F. HILDEBRAND. Down, November 16, 1868.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI wrote my last note in such a hurry from London, that I quite forgot\r\nwhat I chiefly wished to say, namely to thank you for your excellent\r\nnotices in the 'Bot. Zeitung' of my paper on the offspring of dimorphic\r\nplants. The subject is so obscure that I did not expect that any one\r\nwould have noticed my paper, and I am accordingly very much pleased\r\nthat you should have brought the subject before the many excellent\r\nnaturalists of Germany.\r\n\r\nOf all the German authors (but they are not many) whose works I have\r\nread, you write by far the clearest style, but whether this is a\r\ncompliment to a German writer I do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The two following letters refer to the small bud-like \"Cleistogamic\"\r\nflowers found in the violet and many other plants. They do not open and\r\nare necessarily self-fertilised:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 30 [1862].\r\n\r\n... What will become of my book on Variation? I am involved in a\r\nmultiplicity of experiments. I have been amusing myself by looking at\r\nthe small flowers of Viola. If Oliver (Shortly afterwards he wrote:\r\n\"Oliver, the omniscient, has sent me a paper in the 'Bot. Zeitung,' with\r\nmost accurate description of all that I saw in Viola.\") has had time to\r\nstudy them, he will have seen the curious case (as it seems to me) which\r\nI have just made clearly out, viz. that in these flowers, the FEW pollen\r\ngrains are never shed, or never leave the anther-cells, but emit long\r\npollen tubes, which penetrate the stigma. To-day I got the anther with\r\nthe included pollen grain (now empty) at one end, and a bundle of tubes\r\npenetrating the stigmatic tissue at the other end; I got the whole under\r\na microscope without breaking the tubes; I wonder whether the stigma\r\npours some fluid into the anther so as to excite the included grains. It\r\nis a rather odd case of correlation, that in the double sweet violet\r\nthe small flowers are double; i.e., have a multitude of minute scales\r\nrepresenting the petals. What queer little flowers they are.\r\n\r\nHave you had time to read poor dear Henslow's life? it has interested me\r\nfor the man's sake, and, what I did not think possible, has even exalted\r\nhis character in my estimation...\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following is an extract from the letter given in part above, and\r\nrefers to Dr. Gray's article on the sexual differences of plants:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. NOVEMBER 26 [1862].\r\n\r\n... You will think that I am in the most unpleasant, contradictory,\r\nfractious humour, when I tell you that I do not like your term of\r\n\"precocious fertilisation\" for your second class of dimorphism [i.e. for\r\ncleistogamic fertilisation]. If I can trust my memory, the state of\r\nthe corolla, of the stigma, and the pollen-grains is different from the\r\nstate of the parts in the bud; that they are in a condition of special\r\nmodification. But upon my life I am ashamed of myself to differ so much\r\nfrom my betters on this head. The TEMPORARY theory (This view is now\r\ngenerally accepted.) which I have formed on this class of dimorphism,\r\njust to guide experiment, is that the PERFECT flowers can only be\r\nperfectly fertilised by insects, and are in this case abundantly\r\ncrossed; but that the flowers are not always, especially in early\r\nspring, visited enough by insects, and therefore the little imperfect\r\nself-fertilising flowers are developed to ensure a sufficiency of seed\r\nfor present generations. Viola canina is sterile, when not visited by\r\ninsects, but when so visited forms plenty of seed. I infer from the\r\nstructure of three or four forms of Balsamineae, that these require\r\ninsects; at least there is almost as plain adaptation to insects as in\r\nthe Orchids. I have Oxalis acetosella ready in pots for experiment\r\nnext spring; and I fear this will upset my little theory... Campanula\r\ncarpathica, as I found this summer, is absolutely sterile if insects are\r\nexcluded. Specularia speculum is fairly fertile when enclosed; and this\r\nseemed to me to be partially effected by the frequent closing of the\r\nflower; the inward angular folds of the corolla corresponding with the\r\nclefts of the open stigma, and in this action pushing pollen from the\r\noutside of the stigma on to its surface. Now can you tell me, does S.\r\nperfoliata close its flower like S. speculum, with angular inward folds?\r\nif so, I am smashed without some fearful \"wriggling.\" Are the IMPERFECT\r\nflowers of your Specularia the early or the later ones? very early or\r\nvery late? It is rather pretty to see the importance of the closing of\r\nflowers of S. speculum.\r\n\r\n\r\n['Forms of Flowers' was published in July; in June, 1877, he wrote to\r\nProfessor Carus with regard to the translation:--\r\n\r\n\"My new book is not a long one, viz. 350 pages, chiefly of the larger\r\ntype, with fifteen simple woodcuts. All the proofs are corrected except\r\nthe Index, so that it will soon be published.\r\n\r\n\"... I do not suppose that I shall publish any more books, though perhaps\r\na few more papers. I cannot endure being idle, but heaven knows whether\r\nI am capable of any more good work.\"\r\n\r\nThe review alluded to in the next letter is at page 445 of the volume of\r\n'Nature' for 1878:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W. THISELTON DYER. Down, April 5, 1878.\r\n\r\nMy dear Dyer,\r\n\r\nI have just read in 'Nature' the review of 'Forms of Flowers,' and I am\r\nsure that it is by you. I wish with all my heart that it deserved one\r\nquarter of the praises which you give it. Some of your remarks have\r\ninterested me greatly... Hearty thanks for your generous and most kind\r\nsympathy, which does a man real good, when he is as dog-tired as I am at\r\nthis minute with working all day, so good-bye.\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.XIII. -- CLIMBING AND INSECTIVOROUS PLANTS.\r\n\r\n[My father mentions in his 'Autobiography' (volume i.) that he was led\r\nto take up the subject of climbing plants by reading Dr. Gray's paper,\r\n\"Note on the Coiling of the Tendrils of Plants.\" ('Proc. Amer. Acad. of\r\nArts and Sciences,' 1858.) This essay seems to have been read in 1862,\r\nbut I am only able to guess at the date of the letter in which he asks\r\nfor a reference to it, so that the precise date of his beginning this\r\nwork cannot be determined.\r\n\r\nIn June 1863 he was certainly at work, and wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker for\r\ninformation as to previous publications on the subject, being then in\r\nignorance of Palm's and H. v. Mohl's works on climbing plants, both of\r\nwhich were published in 1827.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [June] 25 [1863].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have been observing pretty carefully a little fact which has surprised\r\nme; and I want to know from you and Oliver whether it seems new or odd\r\nto you, so just tell me whenever you write; it is a very trifling fact,\r\nso do not answer on purpose.\r\n\r\nI have got a plant of Echinocystis lobata to observe the irritability\r\nof the tendrils described by Asa Gray, and which of course, is plain\r\nenough. Having the plant in my study, I have been surprised to find\r\nthat the uppermost part of each branch (i.e. the stem between the two\r\nuppermost leaves excluding the growing tip) is CONSTANTLY and slowly\r\ntwisting round making a circle in from one-half to two hours; it\r\nwill sometimes go round two or three times, and then at the same rate\r\nuntwists and twists in opposite directions. It generally rests half\r\nan hour before it retrogrades. The stem does not become permanently\r\ntwisted. The stem beneath the twisting portion does not move in the\r\nleast, though not tied. The movement goes on all day and all early\r\nnight. It has no relation to light for the plant stands in my window\r\nand twists from the light just as quickly as towards it. This may be a\r\ncommon phenomenon for what I know, but it confounded me quite, when I\r\nbegan to observe the irritability of the tendrils. I do not say it is\r\nthe final cause, but the result is pretty, for the plant every one and\r\na half or two hours sweeps a circle (according to the length of the\r\nbending shoot and the length of the tendril) of from one foot to twenty\r\ninches in diameter, and immediately that the tendril touches any object\r\nits sensitiveness causes it immediately to seize it; a clever gardener,\r\nmy neighbour, who saw the plant on my table last night, said: \"I\r\nbelieve, Sir, the tendrils can see, for wherever I put a plant it finds\r\nout any stick near enough.\" I believe the above is the explanation, viz.\r\nthat it sweeps slowly round and round. The tendrils have some sense, for\r\nthey do not grasp each other when young.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, July 14 [1863].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI am getting very much amused by my tendrils, it is just the sort of\r\nniggling work which suits me, and takes up no time and rather rests me\r\nwhilst writing. So will you just think whether you know any plant, which\r\nyou could give or lend me, or I could buy, with tendrils, remarkable in\r\nany way for development, for odd or peculiar structure, or even for an\r\nodd place in natural arrangement. I have seen or can see Cucurbitaceae,\r\nPassion-flower, Virginian-creeper, Cissus discolor, Common-pea\r\nand Everlasting-pea. It is really curious the diversification of\r\nirritability (I do not mean the spontaneous movement, about which I\r\nwrote before and correctly, as further observation shows): for instance,\r\nI find a slight pinch between the thumb and finger at the end of the\r\ntendril of the Cucurbitaceae causes prompt movement, but a pinch excites\r\nno movement in Cissus. The cause is that one side alone (the concave) is\r\nirritable in the former; whereas both sides are irritable in Cissus, so\r\nif you excite at the same time both OPPOSITE sides there is no movement,\r\nbut by touching with a pencil the two branches of the tendril, in any\r\npart whatever, you cause movement towards that point; so that I can\r\nmould, by a mere touch, the two branches into any shape I like...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, August 4 [1863].\r\n\r\nMy present hobby-horse I owe to you, viz. the tendrils: their\r\nirritability is beautiful, as beautiful in all its modifications as\r\nanything in Orchids. About the SPONTANEOUS movement (independent of\r\ntouch) of the tendrils and upper internodes, I am rather taken aback by\r\nyour saying, \"is it not wel-known?\" I can find nothing in any book which\r\nI have... The spontaneous movement of the tendrils is independent of the\r\nmovement of the upper internodes, but both work harmoniously together\r\nin sweeping a circle for the tendrils to grasp a stick. So with all\r\nclimbing plants (without tendrils) as yet examined, the upper internodes\r\ngo on night and day sweeping a circle in one fixed direction. It is\r\nsurprising to watch the Apocyneae with shoots 18 inches long (beyond the\r\nsupporting stick), steadily searching for something to climb up. When\r\nthe shoot meets a stick, the motion at that point is arrested, but in\r\nthe upper part is continued; so that the climbing of all plants yet\r\nexamined is the simple result of the spontaneous circulatory movement of\r\nthe upper internodes. Pray tell me whether anything has been published\r\non this subject? I hate publishing what is old; but I shall hardly\r\nregret my work if it is old, as it has much amused me...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. May 28, 1864.\r\n\r\n... An Irish nobleman on his death-bed declared that he could\r\nconscientiously say that he had never throughout life denied himself any\r\npleasure; and I can conscientiously say that I have never scrupled to\r\ntrouble you; so here goes.--Have you travelled South, and can you tell\r\nme whether the trees, which Bignonia capreolata climbs, are covered with\r\nmoss or filamentous lichen or Tillandsia? (He subsequently learned from\r\nDr. Gray that Polypodium incanum abounds on the trees in the districts\r\nwhere this species of Bignonia grows. See 'Climbing Plants,' page 103.)\r\nI ask because its tendrils abhor a simple stick, do not much relish\r\nrough bark, but delight in wool or moss. They adhere in a curious manner\r\nby making little disks, like the Ampelopsis... By the way, I will enclose\r\nsome specimens, and if you think it worth while, you can put them under\r\nthe simple microscope. It is remarkable how specially adapted some\r\ntendrils are; those of Eccremocarpus scaber do not like a stick, will\r\nhave nothing to say to wool; but give them a bundle of culms of grass,\r\nor a bundle of bristles and they seize them well.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, June 10 [1864].\r\n\r\n... I have now read two German books, and all I believe that has been\r\nwritten on climbers, and it has stirred me up to find that I have a\r\ngood deal of new matter. It is strange, but I really think no one has\r\nexplained simple twining plants. These books have stirred me up, and\r\nmade me wish for plants specified in them. I shall be very glad of those\r\nyou mention. I have written to Veitch for young Nepenthes and Vanilla\r\n(which I believe will turn out a grand case, though a root creeper),\r\nif I cannot buy young Vanilla I will ask you. I have ordered a\r\nleaf-climbing fern, Lygodium. All this work about climbers would hurt\r\nmy conscience, did I think I could do harder work. (He was much out of\r\nhealth at this time.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[He continued his observations on climbing plants during the prolonged\r\nillness from which he suffered in the autumn of 1863, and in the\r\nfollowing spring. He wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker, apparently in March\r\n1864:--\r\n\r\n\"For several days I have been decidedly better, and what I lay much\r\nstress on (whatever doctors say), my brain feels far stronger, and I\r\nhave lost many dreadful sensations. The hot-house is such an amusement\r\nto me, and my amusement I owe to you, as my delight is to look at the\r\nmany odd leaves and plants from Kew... The only approach to work which\r\nI can do is to look at tendrils and climbers, this does not distress my\r\nweakened brain. Ask Oliver to look over the enclosed queries (and do you\r\nlook) and amuse a broken-down brother naturalist by answering any which\r\nhe can. If you ever lounge through your houses, remember me and climbing\r\nplants.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 29, 1864, he wrote to Dr. Gray:--\r\n\r\n\"I have not been able to resist doing a little more at your godchild, my\r\nclimbing paper, or rather in size little book, which by Jove I will have\r\ncopied out, else I shall never stop. This has been new sort of work\r\nfor me, and I have been pleased to find what a capital guide for\r\nobservations a full conviction of the change of species is.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 19, 1865, he wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"It is working hours, but I am trying to take a day's holiday, for I\r\nfinished and despatched yesterday my climbing paper. For the last ten\r\ndays I have done nothing but correct refractory sentences, and I loathe\r\nthe whole subject.\"\r\n\r\nA letter to Dr. Gray, April 9, 1865, has a word or two on the subject:--\r\n\r\n\"I have begun correcting proofs of my paper on 'Climbing Plants.' I\r\nsuppose I shall be able to send you a copy in four or five weeks. I\r\nthink it contains a good deal new and some curious points, but it is so\r\nfearfully long, that no one will ever read it. If, however, you do not\r\nSKIM through it, you will be an unnatural parent, for it is your child.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gray not only read it but approved of it, to my father's great\r\nsatisfaction, as the following extracts show:--\r\n\r\n\"I was much pleased to get your letter of July 24th. Now that I can\r\ndo nothing, I maunder over old subjects, and your approbation of my\r\nclimbing paper gives me VERY great satisfaction. I made my observations\r\nwhen I could do nothing else and much enjoyed it, but always doubted\r\nwhether they were worth publishing. I demur to its not being necessary\r\nto explain in detail about the spires in CAUGHT tendrils running in\r\nopposite directions; for the fact for a long time confounded me, and\r\nI have found it difficult enough to explain the cause to two or three\r\npersons.\" (August 15, 1865.)\r\n\r\n\"I received yesterday your article (In the September number of\r\n'Silliman's Journal,' concluded in the January number, 1866.) on\r\nclimbers, and it has pleased me in an extraordinary and even silly\r\nmanner. You pay me a superb compliment, and as I have just said to my\r\nwife, I think my friends must perceive that I like praise, they give me\r\nsuch hearty doses. I always admire your skill in reviews or abstracts,\r\nand you have done this article excellently and given the whole essence\r\nof my paper... I have had a letter from a good Zoologist in S. Brazil,\r\nF. Muller, who has been stirred up to observe climbers and gives me some\r\ncurious cases of BRANCH-climbers, in which branches are converted\r\ninto tendrils, and then continue to grow and throw out leaves and new\r\nbranches, and then lose their tendril character.\" (October 1865.)\r\n\r\nThe paper on Climbing Plants was republished in 1875, as a separate\r\nbook. The author had been unable to give his customary amount of care to\r\nthe style of the original essay, owing to the fact that it was written\r\nduring a period of continued ill-health, and it was now found to require\r\na great deal of alteration. He wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker (March 3,\r\n1875): \"It is lucky for authors in general that they do not require such\r\ndreadful work in merely licking what they write into shape.\" And to Mr.\r\nMurray in September he wrote: \"The corrections are heavy in 'Climbing\r\nPlants,' and yet I deliberately went over the MS. and old sheets three\r\ntimes.\" The book was published in September 1875, an edition of 1500\r\ncopies was struck off; the edition sold fairly well, and 500 additional\r\ncopies were printed in June of the following year.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTIVOROUS PLANTS.\r\n\r\n[In the summer of 1860 he was staying at the house of his sister-in-law,\r\nMiss Wedgwood, in Ashdown Forest, whence he wrote (July 29, 1860), to\r\nSir Joseph Hooker;--\r\n\r\n\"Latterly I have done nothing here; but at first I amused myself with\r\na few observations on the insect-catching power of Drosera; and I must\r\nconsult you some time whether my 'twaddle' is worth communicating to the\r\nLinnean Society.\"\r\n\r\nIn August he wrote to the same friend:--\r\n\r\n\"I will gratefully send my notes on Drosera when copied by my copier:\r\nthe subject amused me when I had nothing to do.\"\r\n\r\nHe has described in the 'Autobiography' (volume i.), the general nature\r\nof these early experiments. He noticed insects sticking to the leaves,\r\nand finding that flies, etc., placed on the adhesive glands were held\r\nfast and embraced, he suspected that the leaves were adapted to supply\r\nnitrogenous food to the plant. He therefore tried the effect on the\r\nleaves of various nitrogenous fluids--with results which, as far as they\r\nwent, verified his surmise. In September, 1860, he wrote to Dr. Gray:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been infinitely amused by working at Drosera: the movements\r\nare really curious; and the manner in which the leaves detect certain\r\nnitrogenous compounds is marvellous. You will laugh; but it is, at\r\npresent, my full belief (after endless experiments) that they detect\r\n(and move in consequence of) the 1/2880 part of a single grain of\r\nnitrate of ammonia; but the muriate and sulphate of ammonia bother their\r\nchemical skill, and they cannot make anything of the nitrogen in these\r\nsalts! I began this work on Drosera in relation to GRADATION as throwing\r\nlight on Dionaea.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the autumn he was again obliged to leave home for Eastbourne,\r\nwhere he continued his work on Drosera. The work was so new to him that\r\nhe found himself in difficulties in the preparation of solutions, and\r\nbecame puzzled over fluid and solid ounces, etc. etc. To a friend, the\r\nlate Mr. E. Cresy, who came to his help in the matter of weights and\r\nmeasures, he wrote giving an account of the experiments. The extract\r\n(November 2, 1860) which follows illustrates the almost superstitious\r\nprecautions he often applied to his researches:--\r\n\r\n\"Generally I have scrutinised every gland and hair on the leaf before\r\nexperimenting; but it occurred to me that I might in some way affect the\r\nleaf; though this is almost impossible, as I scrutinised with equal care\r\nthose that I put into distilled water (the same water being used for\r\ndissolving the carbonate of ammonia). I then cut off four leaves (not\r\ntouching them with my fingers), and put them in plain water, and four\r\nother leaves into the weak solution, and after leaving them for an hour\r\nand a half, I examined every hair on all eight leaves; no change on the\r\nfour in water; every gland and hair affected in those in ammonia.\r\n\r\n\"I had measured the quantity of weak solution, and I counted the glands\r\nwhich had absorbed the ammonia, and were plainly affected; the result\r\nconvinced me that each gland could not have absorbed more than 1/64000\r\nor 1/65000 of a grain. I have tried numbers of other experiments all\r\npointing to the same result. Some experiments lead me to believe that\r\nvery sensitive leaves are acted on by much smaller doses. Reflect\r\nhow little ammonia a plant can get growing on poor soil--yet it is\r\nnourished. The really surprising part seems to me that the effect should\r\nbe visible, and not under very high power; for after trying a high\r\npower, I thought it would be safer not to consider any effect which\r\nwas not plainly visible under a two-thirds object glass and middle\r\neye-piece. The effect which the carbonate of ammonia produces is the\r\nsegregation of the homogeneous fluid in the cells into a cloud of\r\ngranules and colourless fluid; and subsequently the granules coalesce\r\ninto larger masses, and for hours have the oddest movements--coalescing,\r\ndividing, coalescing ad infinitum. I do not know whether you will care\r\nfor these ill-written details; but, as you asked, I am sure I am bound\r\nto comply, after all the very kind and great trouble which you have\r\ntaken.\"\r\n\r\nOn his return home he wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker (November 21, 1860):--\r\n\r\n\"I have been working like a madman at Drosera. Here is a fact for you\r\nwhich is certain as you stand where you are, though you won't believe\r\nit, that a bit of hair 1/78000 of one grain in weight placed on gland,\r\nwill cause ONE of the gland-bearing hairs of Drosera to curve inwards,\r\nand will alter the condition of the contents of every cell in the\r\nfoot-stalk of the gland.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a few days later to Lyell:--\r\n\r\n\"I will and must finish my Drosera MS., which will take me a week, for,\r\nat the present moment, I care more about Drosera than the origin of all\r\nthe species in the world. But I will not publish on Drosera till next\r\nyear, for I am frightened and astounded at my results. I declare it is\r\na certain fact, that one organ is so sensitive to touch, that a weight\r\nseventy-eight times less than that, viz., 1/1000 of a grain, which\r\nwill move the best chemical balance, suffices to cause a conspicuous\r\nmovement. Is it not curious that a plant should be far more sensitive to\r\nthe touch than any nerve in the human body? Yet I am perfectly sure that\r\nthis is true. When I am on my hobby-horse, I never can resist telling my\r\nfriends how well my hobby goes, so you must forgive the rider.\"\r\n\r\nThe work was continued, as a holiday task, at Bournemouth, where he\r\nstayed during the autumn of 1862. The discussion in the following letter\r\non \"nervous matter\" in Drosera is of interest in relation to recent\r\nresearches on the continuity of protoplasm from cell to cell:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Cliff Cottage, Bournemouth. September 26\r\n[1862].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nDo not read this till you have leisure. If that blessed moment ever\r\ncomes, I should be very glad to have your opinion on the subject of this\r\nletter. I am led to the opinion that Drosera must have diffused matter\r\nin organic connection, closely analogous to the nervous matter of\r\nanimals. When the glands of one of the papillae or tentacles, in its\r\nnatural position is supplied with nitrogenised fluid and certain other\r\nstimulants, or when loaded with an extremely slight weight, or when\r\nstruck several times with a needle, the pedicel bends near its base in\r\nunder one minute. These varied stimulants are conveyed down the pedicel\r\nby some means; it cannot be vibration, for drops of fluid put on quite\r\nquietly cause the movement; it cannot be absorption of the fluid from\r\ncell to cell, for I can see the rate of absorption, which though quick,\r\nis far slower, and in Dionaea the transmission is instantaneous;\r\nanalogy from animals would point to transmission through nervous matter.\r\nReflecting on the rapid power of absorption in the glands, the extreme\r\nsensibility of the whole organ, and the conspicuous movement caused by\r\nvaried stimulants, I have tried a number of substances which are not\r\ncaustic or corrosive,... but most of which are known to have a remarkable\r\naction on the nervous matter of animals. You will see the results in\r\nthe enclosed paper. As the nervous matter of different animals are\r\ndifferently acted on by the same poisons, one would not expect the\r\nsame action on plants and animals; only if plants have diffused nervous\r\nmatter, some degree of analogous action. And this is partially the case.\r\nConsidering these experiments, together with the previously made remarks\r\non the functions of the parts, I cannot avoid the conclusion,\r\nthat Drosera possesses matter at least in some degree analogous in\r\nconstitution and function to nervous matter. Now do tell me what you\r\nthink, as far as you can judge from my abstract; of course many more\r\nexperiments would have to be tried; but in former years I tried on the\r\nwhole leaf, instead of on separate glands, a number of innocuous (This\r\nline of investigation made him wish for information on the action\r\nof poisons on plants; as in many other cases he applied to Professor\r\nOliver, and in reference to the result wrote to Hooker: \"Pray thank\r\nOliver heartily for his heap of references on poisons.\") substances,\r\nsuch as sugar, gum, starch, etc., and they produced no effect. Your\r\nopinion will aid me in deciding some future year in going on with\r\nthis subject. I should not have thought it worth attempting, but I had\r\nnothing on earth to do.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker, Yours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--We return home on Monday 28th. Thank Heaven!\r\n\r\n\r\n[A long break now ensued in his work on insectivorous plants, and it was\r\nnot till 1872 that the subject seriously occupied him again. A passage\r\nin a letter to Dr. Asa Gray, written in 1863 or 1864, shows, however,\r\nthat the question was not altogether absent from his mind in the\r\ninterim:--\r\n\r\n\"Depend on it you are unjust on the merits of my beloved Drosera; it is\r\na wonderful plant, or rather a most sagacious animal. I will stick up\r\nfor Drosera to the day of my death. Heaven knows whether I shall ever\r\npublish my pile of experiments on it.\"\r\n\r\nHe notes in his diary that the last proof of the 'Expression of the\r\nEmotions' was finished on August 22, 1872, and that he began to work on\r\nDrosera on the following day.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. [Sevenoaks], October 22 [1872].\r\n\r\n... I have worked pretty hard for four or five weeks on Drosera, and\r\nthen broke down; so that we took a house near Sevenoaks for three weeks\r\n(where I now am) to get complete rest. I have very little power of\r\nworking now, and must put off the rest of the work on Drosera till next\r\nspring, as my plants are dying. It is an endless subject, and I must cut\r\nit short, and for this reason shall not do much on Dionaea. The point\r\nwhich has interested me most is tracing the NERVES! which follow the\r\nvascular bundles. By a prick with a sharp lancet at a certain point,\r\nI can paralyse one-half the leaf, so that a stimulus to the other half\r\ncauses no movement. It is just like dividing the spinal marrow of a\r\nfrog:--no stimulus can be sent from the brain or anterior part of the\r\nspine to the hind legs; but if these latter are stimulated, they move by\r\nreflex action. I find my old results about the astonishing sensitiveness\r\nof the nervous system (!?)of Drosera to various stimulants fully\r\nconfirmed and extended...\r\n\r\n\r\n[His work on digestion in Drosera and other points in the physiology of\r\nthe plant soon led him into regions where his knowledge was defective,\r\nand here the advice and assistance which he received from Dr. Burdon\r\nSanderson was of much value:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J. BURDON SANDERSON. Down, July 25, 1873.\r\n\r\nMy dear Dr. Sanderson,\r\n\r\nI should like to tell you a little about my recent work with Drosera, to\r\nshow that I have profited by your suggestions, and to ask a question or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n1. It is really beautiful how quickly and well Drosera and Dionaea\r\ndissolve little cubes of albumen and gelatine. I kept the same sized\r\ncubes on wet moss for comparison. When you were here I forgot that I had\r\ntried gelatine, but albumen is far better for watching its dissolution\r\nand absorption. Frankland has told me how to test in a rough way for\r\npepsin; and in the autumn he will discover what acid the digestive juice\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\n2. A decoction of cabbage-leaves and green peas causes as much\r\ninflection as an infusion of raw meat; a decoction of grass is less\r\npowerful. Though I hear that the chemists try to precipitate all albumen\r\nfrom the extract of belladonna, I think they must fail, as the extract\r\ncauses inflection, whereas a new lot of atropine, as well as the\r\nvalerianate [of atropine], produce no effect.\r\n\r\n3. I have been trying a good many experiments with heated water... Should\r\nyou not call the following case one of heat rigor? Two leaves were\r\nheated to 130 deg, and had every tentacle closely inflected; one was\r\ntaken out and placed in cold water, and it re-expanded; the other was\r\nheated to 145 deg, and had not the least power of re-expansion. Is not\r\nthis latter case heat rigor? If you can inform me, I should very much\r\nlike to hear at what temperature cold-blooded and invertebrate animals\r\nare killed.\r\n\r\n4. I must tell you my final result, of which I am sure, [as to] the\r\nsensitiveness of Drosera. I made a solution of one part of phosphate of\r\nammonia by weight to 218,750 of water; of this solution I gave so much\r\nthat a leaf got 1/8000 of a grain of the phosphate. I then counted the\r\nglands, and each could have got only 1/1552000 of a grain; this being\r\nabsorbed by the glands, sufficed to cause the tentacles bearing these\r\nglands to bend through an angle of 180 deg. Such sensitiveness requires\r\nhot weather, and carefully selected young yet mature leaves. It strikes\r\nme as a wonderful fact. I must add that I took every precaution, by\r\ntrying numerous leaves at the same time in the solution and in the same\r\nwater which was used for making the solution.\r\n\r\n5. If you can persuade your friend to try the effects of carbonate of\r\nammonia on the aggregation of the white blood corpuscles, I should very\r\nmuch like to hear the result.\r\n\r\nI hope this letter will not have wearied you.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W. THISELTON DYER. Down, 24 [December 1873?].\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Dyer,\r\n\r\nI fear that you will think me a great bore, but I cannot resist telling\r\nyou that I have just found out that the leaves of Pinguicula possess\r\na beautifully adapted power of movement. Last night I put on a row of\r\nlittle flies near one edge of two YOUNGISH leaves; and after 14 hours\r\nthese edges are beautifully folded over so as to clasp the flies, thus\r\nbringing the glands into contact with the upper surfaces of the flies,\r\nand they are now secreting copiously above and below the flies and no\r\ndoubt absorbing. The acid secretion has run down the channelled edge and\r\nhas collected in the spoon-shaped extremity, where no doubt the glands\r\nare absorbing the delicious soup. The leaf on one side looks just like\r\nthe helix of a human ear, if you were to stuff flies within the fold.\r\nYours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, June 3 [1874].\r\n\r\n... I am now hard at work getting my book on Drosera & Co. ready for the\r\nprinters, but it will take some time, for I am always finding out new\r\npoints to observe. I think you will be interested by my observations on\r\nthe digestive process in Drosera; the secretion contains an acid of the\r\nacetic series, and some ferment closely analogous to, but not identical\r\nwith, pepsin; for I have been making a long series of comparative\r\ntrials. No human being will believe what I shall publish about the\r\nsmallness of the doses of phosphate of ammonia which act.\r\n\r\n... I began reading the Madagascar squib (A description of a carnivorous\r\nplant supposed to subsist on human beings.) quite gravely, and when I\r\nfound it stated that Felis and Bos inhabited Madagascar, I thought it\r\nwas a false story, and did not perceive it was a hoax till I came to the\r\nwoman...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO F.C. DONDERS. (Professor Donders, the well-known\r\nphysiologist of Utrecht.) Down, July 7, 1874.\r\n\r\nMy dear Professor Donders,\r\n\r\nMy son George writes to me that he has seen you, and that you have been\r\nvery kind to him, for which I return to you my cordial thanks. He\r\ntells me on your authority, of a fact which interests me in the highest\r\ndegree, and which I much wish to be allowed to quote. It relates to the\r\naction of one millionth of a grain of atropine on the eye. Now will you\r\nbe so kind, whenever you can find a little leisure, to tell me whether\r\nyou yourself have observed this fact, or believe it on good authority.\r\nI also wish to know what proportion by weight the atropine bore to the\r\nwater solution, and how much of the solution was applied to the eye. The\r\nreason why I am so anxious on this head is that it gives some support\r\nto certain facts repeatedly observed by me with respect to the action of\r\nphosphate of ammonia on Drosera. The 1/4000000 of a grain absorbed by\r\na gland clearly makes the tentacle which bears this gland become\r\ninflected; and I am fully convinced that 1/20000000 of a grain of the\r\ncrystallised salt (i.e. containing about one-third of its weight of\r\nwater of crystallisation) does the same. Now I am quite unhappy at the\r\nthought of having to publish such a statement. It will be of great value\r\nto me to be able to give any analogous facts in support. The case of\r\nDrosera is all the more interesting as the absorption of the salt or\r\nany other stimulant applied to the gland causes it to transmit a motor\r\ninfluence to the base of the tentacle which bears the gland.\r\n\r\nPray forgive me for troubling you, and do not trouble yourself to answer\r\nthis until your health is fully re-established.\r\n\r\nPray believe me, Yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[During the summer of 1874 he was at work on the genus Utricularia,\r\nand he wrote (July 16th) to Sir J.D. Hooker giving some account of the\r\nprogress of his work:--\r\n\r\n\"I am rather glad you have not been able to send Utricularia, for the\r\ncommon species has driven F. and me almost mad. The structure is MOST\r\ncomplex. The bladders catch a multitude of Entomostraca, and larvae of\r\ninsects. The mechanism for capture is excellent. But there is much that\r\nwe cannot understand. From what I have seen to-day, I strongly suspect\r\nthat it is necrophagous, i.e. that it cannot digest, but absorbs\r\ndecaying matter.\"\r\n\r\nHe was indebted to Lady Dorothy Nevill for specimens of the curious\r\nUtricularia montana, which is not aquatic like the European species,\r\nbut grows among the moss and debris on the branches of trees. To this\r\nspecies the following letter refers:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO LADY DOROTHY NEVILL. Down September 18 [1874].\r\n\r\nDear Lady Dorothy Nevill,\r\n\r\nI am so much obliged to you. I was so convinced that the bladders were\r\nwith the leaves that I never thought of removing the moss, and this was\r\nvery stupid of me. The great solid bladder-like swellings almost on the\r\nsurface are wonderful objects, but are not the true bladders. These I\r\nfound on the roots near the surface, and down to a depth of two inches\r\nin the sand. They are as transparent as glass, from 1/20 to 1/100 of\r\nan inch in size, and hollow. They have all the important points of\r\nstructure of the bladders of the floating English species, and I felt\r\nconfident I should find captured prey. And so I have to my delight in\r\ntwo bladders, with clear proof that they had absorbed food from the\r\ndecaying mass. For Utricularia is a carrion-feeder, and not strictly\r\ncarnivorous like Drosera.\r\n\r\nThe great solid bladder-like bodies, I believe, are reservoirs of water\r\nlike a camel's stomach. As soon as I have made a few more observations,\r\nI mean to be so cruel as to give your plant no water, and observe\r\nwhether the great bladders shrink and contain air instead of water; I\r\nshall then also wash all earth from all roots, and see whether there are\r\ntrue bladders for capturing subterranean insects down to the very bottom\r\nof the pot. Now shall you think me very greedy, if I say that supposing\r\nthe species is not very precious, and you have several, will you give\r\nme one more plant, and if so, please to send it to \"Orpington Station,\r\nS.E.R., to be forwarded by foot messenger.\"\r\n\r\nI have hardly ever enjoyed a day more in my life than I have this day's\r\nwork; and this I owe to your Ladyship's great kindness.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are very curious monsters; I fancy of some plant allied to\r\nMedicago, but I will show them to Dr. Hooker.\r\n\r\nYour ladyship's very gratefully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, September 30, 1874.\r\n\r\nMy dear H.,\r\n\r\nYour magnificent present of Aldrovanda has arrived quite safe. I have\r\nenjoyed greatly a good look at the shut leaves, one of which I cut open.\r\nIt is an aquatic Dionaea, which has acquired some structures identical\r\nwith those of Utricularia!\r\n\r\nIf the leaves open and I can transfer them open under the microscope, I\r\nwill try some experiments, for mortal man cannot resist the temptation.\r\nIf I cannot transfer, I will do nothing, for otherwise it would require\r\nhundreds of leaves.\r\n\r\nYou are a good man to give me such pleasure.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The manuscript of 'Insectivorous Plants' was finished in March 1875.\r\nHe seems to have been more than usually oppressed by the writing of this\r\nbook, thus he wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker in February:--\r\n\r\n\"You ask about my book, and all that I can say is that I am ready to\r\ncommit suicide; I thought it was decently written, but find so much\r\nwants rewriting, that it will not be ready to go to printers for two\r\nmonths, and will then make a confoundedly big book. Murray will say that\r\nit is no use publishing in the middle of summer, so I do not know what\r\nwill be the upshot; but I begin to think that every one who publishes a\r\nbook is a fool.\"\r\n\r\nThe book was published on July 2nd, 1875, and 2700 copies were sold out\r\nof the edition of 3000.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.XIV. -- THE 'POWER OF MOVEMENT IN PLANTS.'\r\n\r\n1880.\r\n\r\n[The few sentences in the autobiographical chapter give with sufficient\r\nclearness the connection between the 'Power of Movement,' and one of the\r\nauthor's earlier books, that on 'Climbing Plants.' The central idea\r\nof the book is that the movements of plants in relation to light,\r\ngravitation, etc., are modifications of a spontaneous tendency to\r\nrevolve or circumnutate, which is widely inherent in the growing parts\r\nof plants. This conception has not been generally adopted, and has not\r\ntaken a place among the canons of orthodox physiology. The book has been\r\ntreated by Professor Sachs with a few words of professorial contempt;\r\nand by Professor Wiesner it has been honoured by careful and generously\r\nexpressed criticism.\r\n\r\nMr. Thiselton Dyer ('Charles Darwin' ('Nature' Series), page 41.) has\r\nwell said: \"Whether this masterly conception of the unity of what has\r\nhitherto seemed a chaos of unrelated phenomena will be sustained, time\r\nalone will show. But no one can doubt the importance of what Mr. Darwin\r\nhas done, in showing that for the future the phenomena of plant movement\r\ncan and indeed must be studied from a single point of view.\"\r\n\r\nThe work was begun in the summer of 1877, after the publication of\r\n'Different Forms of Flowers,' and by the autumn his enthusiasm for the\r\nsubject was thoroughly established, and he wrote to Mr. Dyer: \"I am\r\nall on fire at the work.\" At this time he was studying the movements\r\nof cotyledons, in which the sleep of plants is to be observed in its\r\nsimplest form; in the following spring he was trying to discover what\r\nuseful purpose these sleep-movements could serve, and wrote to Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker (March 25th, 1878):--\r\n\r\n\"I think we have PROVED that the sleep of plants is to lessen the injury\r\nto the leaves from radiation. This has interested me much, and has cost\r\nus great labour, as it has been a problem since the time of Linnaeus.\r\nBut we have killed or badly injured a multitude of plants: N.B.--Oxalis\r\ncarnosa was most valuable, but last night was killed.\"\r\n\r\nHis letters of this period do not give any connected account of\r\nthe progress of the work. The two following are given as being\r\ncharacteristic of the author:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W. THISELTON DYER. Down, June 2, 1878.\r\n\r\nMy dear Dyer,\r\n\r\nI remember saying that I should die a disgraced man if I did not observe\r\na seedling Cactus and Cycas, and you have saved me from this horrible\r\nfate, as they move splendidly and normally. But I have two questions to\r\nask: the Cycas observed was a huge seed in a broad and very shallow pot\r\nwith cocoa-nut fibre as I suppose. It was named only Cycas. Was it Cycas\r\npectinata? I suppose that I cannot be wrong in believing that what first\r\nappears above ground is a true leaf, for I can see no stem or axis.\r\nLastly, you may remember that I said that we could not raise Opuntia\r\nnigricans; now I must confess to a piece of stupidity; one did come up,\r\nbut my gardener and self stared at it, and concluded that it could not\r\nbe a seedling Opuntia, but now that I have seen one of O. basilaris, I\r\nam sure it was; I observed it only casually, and saw movements, which\r\nmakes me wish to observe carefully another. If you have any fruit,\r\nwill Mr. Lynch (Mr. R.I. Lynch, now Curator of the Botanic Garden at\r\nCambridge was at this time in the Royal Gardens, Kew.) be so kind as to\r\nsend one more?\r\n\r\nI am working away like a slave at radicles [roots] and at movements of\r\ntrue leaves, for I have pretty well done with cotyledons...\r\n\r\nThat was an EXCELLENT letter about the Gardens (This refers to an\r\nattempt to induce the Government to open the Royal Gardens at Kew in the\r\nmorning.): I had hoped that the agitation was over. Politicians are a\r\npoor truckling lot, for [they] must see the wretched effects of keeping\r\nthe gardens open all day long.\r\n\r\nYour ever troublesome friend, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W. THISELTON DYER. 4 Bryanston St., Portman Square,\r\nNovember 21 [1878].\r\n\r\nMy dear Dyer,\r\n\r\nI must thank you for all the wonderful trouble which you have taken\r\nabout the seeds of Impatiens, and on scores of other occasions. It in\r\ntruth makes me feel ashamed of myself, and I cannot help thinking: \"Oh\r\nLord, when he sees our book he will cry out, is this all for which I\r\nhave helped so much!\" In seriousness, I hope that we have made out some\r\npoints, but I fear that we have done very little for the labour which\r\nwe have expended on our work. We are here for a week for a little rest,\r\nwhich I needed.\r\n\r\nIf I remember right, November 30th, is the anniversary at the Royal, and\r\nI fear Sir Joseph must be almost at the last gasp. I shall be glad when\r\nhe is no longer President.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the spring of the following year, 1879. When he was engaged in\r\nputting his results together, he wrote somewhat despondingly to Mr.\r\nDyer: \"I am overwhelmed with my notes, and almost too old to undertake\r\nthe job which I have in hand--i.e. movements of all kinds. Yet it is\r\nworse to be idle.\"\r\n\r\nLater on in the year, when the work was approaching completion, he wrote\r\nto Prof. Carus (July 17, 1879), with respect to a translation:--\r\n\r\n\"Together with my son Francis, I am preparing a rather large volume on\r\nthe general movements of Plants, and I think that we have made out a\r\ngood many new points and views.\r\n\r\n\"I fear that our views will meet a good deal of opposition in Germany;\r\nbut we have been working very hard for some years at the subject.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be MUCH pleased if you think the book worth translating, and\r\nproof-sheets shall be sent you, whenever they are ready.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn he was hard at work on the manuscript, and wrote to Dr.\r\nGray (October 24, 1879):--\r\n\r\n\"I have written a rather big book--more is the pity--on the movements\r\nof plants, and I am now just beginning to go over the MS. for the second\r\ntime, which is a horrid bore.\"\r\n\r\nOnly the concluding part of the next letter refers to the 'Power of\r\nMovements':]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A. DE CANDOLLE. May 28, 1880.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am particularly obliged to you for having so kindly send me your\r\n'Phytographie' (A book on the methods of botanical research, more\r\nespecially of systematic work.); for if I had merely seen it advertised,\r\nI should not have supposed that it could have concerned me. As it is, I\r\nhave read with very great interest about a quarter, but will not\r\ndelay longer thanking you. All that you say seems to me very clear\r\nand convincing, and as in all your writings I find a large number of\r\nphilosophical remarks new to me, and no doubt shall find many more. They\r\nhave recalled many a puzzle through which I passed when monographing the\r\nCirripedia; and your book in those days would have been quite invaluable\r\nto me. It has pleased me to find that I have always followed your plan\r\nof making notes on separate pieces of paper; I keep several scores of\r\nlarge portfolios, arranged on very thin shelves about two inches apart,\r\nfastened to the walls of my study, and each shelf has its proper name\r\nor title; and I can thus put at once every memorandum into its proper\r\nplace. Your book will, I am sure, be very useful to many young students,\r\nand I shall beg my son Francis (who intends to devote himself to the\r\nphysiology of plants) to read it carefully.\r\n\r\nAs for myself I am taking a fortnight's rest, after sending a pile of\r\nMS. to the printers, and it was a piece of good fortune that your book\r\narrived as I was getting into my carriage, for I wanted something to\r\nread whilst away from home. My MS. relates to the movements of plants,\r\nand I think that I have succeeded in showing that all the more important\r\ngreat classes of movements are due to the modification of a kind of\r\nmovement common to all parts of all plants from their earliest youth.\r\n\r\nPray give my kind remembrances to your son, and with my highest respect\r\nand best thanks,\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Sir, yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--It always pleases me to exalt plants in the organic scale, and if\r\nyou will take the trouble to read my last chapter when my book (which\r\nwill be sadly too big) is published and sent to you, I hope and think\r\nthat you also will admire some of the beautiful adaptations by which\r\nseedling plants are enabled to perform their proper functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The book was published on November 6, 1880, and 1500 copies were\r\ndisposed of at Mr. Murray's sale. With regard to it he wrote to Sir J.D.\r\nHooker (November 23):--\r\n\r\n\"Your note has pleased me much--for I did not expect that you would have\r\nhad time to read ANY of it. Read the last chapter, and you will know the\r\nwhole result, but without the evidence. The case, however, of radicles\r\nbending after exposure for an hour to geotropism, with their tips (or\r\nbrains) cut off is, I think, worth your reading (bottom of page 525); it\r\nastounded me. The next most remarkable fact, as it appeared to me (page\r\n148), is the discrimination of the tip of the radicle between a slightly\r\nharder and softer object affixed on opposite sides of tip. But I will\r\nbother you no more about my book. The sensitiveness of seedlings to\r\nlight is marvellous.\"\r\n\r\nTo another friend, Mr. Thiselton Dyer, he wrote (November 28, 1880):--\r\n\r\n\"Very many thanks for your most kind note, but you think too highly of\r\nour work, not but what this is very pleasant... Many of the Germans are\r\nvery contemptuous about making out the use of organs; but they may sneer\r\nthe souls out of their bodies, and I for one shall think it the most\r\ninteresting part of Natural History. Indeed you are greatly mistaken if\r\nyou doubt for one moment on the very great value of your constant and\r\nmost kind assistance to us.\"\r\n\r\nThe book was widely reviewed, and excited much interest among the\r\ngeneral public. The following letter refers to a leading article in the\r\n\"Times\", November 20, 1880:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MRS. HALIBURTON. (Mrs. Haliburton was a daughter of my\r\nfather's early friend, the late Mr. Owen, of Woodhouse.) Down, November\r\n22, 1880.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sarah,\r\n\r\nYou see how audaciously I begin; but I have always loved and shall\r\never love this name. Your letter has done more than please me, for its\r\nkindness has touched my heart. I often think of old days and of the\r\ndelight of my visits to Woodhouse, and of the deep debt of gratitude\r\nI owe to your father. It was very good of you to write. I had quite\r\nforgotten my old ambition about the Shrewsbury newspaper (Mrs.\r\nHaliburton had reminded him of his saying as a boy that if Eddowes'\r\nnewspaper ever alluded to him as \"our deserving fellow-townsman,\" his\r\nambition would be amply gratified.); but I remember the pride which I\r\nfelt when I saw in a book about beetles the impressive words \"captured\r\nby C. Darwin.\" Captured sounded so grand compared with caught. This\r\nseemed to me glory enough for any man! I do not know in the least what\r\nmade the \"Times\" glorify me (The following is the opening sentence\r\nof the leading article:--\"Of all our living men of science none have\r\nlaboured longer and to more splendid purpose than Mr. Darwin.\"), for it\r\nhas sometimes pitched into me ferociously.\r\n\r\nI should very much like to see you again, but you would find a visit\r\nhere very dull, for we feel very old and have no amusement, and lead\r\na solitary life. But we intend in a few weeks to spend a few days in\r\nLondon, and then if you have anything else to do in London, you would\r\nperhaps come and lunch with us. (My father had the pleasure of seeing\r\nMrs. Haliburton at his brother's house in Queen Anne Street.)\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Sarah, Yours gratefully and affectionately, CHARLES\r\nDARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter was called forth by the publication of a volume\r\ndevoted to the criticism of the 'Power of Movement in Plants' by an\r\naccomplished botanist, Dr. Julius Wiesner, Professor of Botany in the\r\nUniversity of Vienna:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO JULIUS WIESNER. Down, October 25th, 1881.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have now finished your book ('Das Bewegungsvermogen der Pflanzen.'\r\nVienna, 1881.), and have understood the whole except a very few\r\npassages. In the first place, let me thank you cordially for the manner\r\nin which you have everywhere treated me. You have shown how a man may\r\ndiffer from another in the most decided manner, and yet express his\r\ndifference with the most perfect courtesy. Not a few English and German\r\nnaturalists might learn a useful lesson from your example; for the\r\ncoarse language often used by scientific men towards each other does no\r\ngood, and only degrades science.\r\n\r\nI have been profoundly interested by your book, and some of your\r\nexperiments are so beautiful, that I actually felt pleasure while being\r\nvivisected. It would take up too much space to discuss all the important\r\ntopics in your book. I fear that you have quite upset the interpretation\r\nwhich I have given of the effects of cutting off the tips of\r\nhorizontally extended roots, and of those laterally exposed to moisture;\r\nbut I cannot persuade myself that the horizontal position of lateral\r\nbranches and roots is due simply to their lessened power of growth. Nor\r\nwhen I think of my experiments with the cotyledons of Phalaris, can I\r\ngive up the belief of the transmission of some stimulus due to light\r\nfrom the upper to the lower part. At page 60 you have misunderstood my\r\nmeaning, when you say that I believe that the effects from light\r\nare transmitted to a part which is not itself heliotropic. I never\r\nconsidered whether or not the short part beneath the ground was\r\nheliotropic; but I believe that with young seedlings the part which\r\nbends NEAR, but ABOVE the ground is heliotropic, and I believe so from\r\nthis part bending only moderately when the light is oblique, and bending\r\nrectangularly when the light is horizontal. Nevertheless the bending of\r\nthis lower part, as I conclude from my experiments with opaque caps,\r\nis influenced by the action of light on the upper part. My opinion,\r\nhowever, on the above and many other points, signifies very little, for\r\nI have no doubt that your book will convince most botanists that I am\r\nwrong in all the points on which we differ.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the question of transmission, my mind is so full of\r\nfacts leading me to believe that light, gravity, etc., act not in a\r\ndirect manner on growth, but as stimuli, that I am quite unable to\r\nmodify my judgment on this head. I could not understand the passage at\r\npage 78, until I consulted my son George, who is a mathematician. He\r\nsupposes that your objection is founded on the diffused light from the\r\nlamp illuminating both sides of the object, and not being reduced, with\r\nincreasing distance in the same ratio as the direct light; but he doubts\r\nwhether this NECESSARY correction will account for the very little\r\ndifference in the heliotropic curvature of the plants in the successive\r\npots.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the sensitiveness of the tips of roots to contact, I\r\ncannot admit your view until it is proved that I am in error about bits\r\nof card attached by liquid gum causing movement; whereas no movement\r\nwas caused if the card remained separated from the tip by a layer of the\r\nliquid gum. The fact also of thicker and thinner bits of card attached\r\non opposite sides of the same root by shellac, causing movement in one\r\ndirection, has to be explained. You often speak of the tip having been\r\ninjured; but externally there was no sign of injury: and when the tip\r\nwas plainly injured, the extreme part became curved TOWARDS the injured\r\nside. I can no more believe that the tip was injured by the bits of\r\ncard, at least when attached by gum-water, than that the glands of\r\nDrosera are injured by a particle of thread or hair placed on it, or\r\nthat the human tongue [is so] when it feels any such object.\r\n\r\nAbout the most important subject in my book, namely circumnutation, I\r\ncan only say that I feel utterly bewildered at the difference in our\r\nconclusions; but I could not fully understand some parts which my\r\nson Francis will be able to translate to me when he returns home. The\r\ngreater part of your book is beautifully clear.\r\n\r\nFinally, I wish that I had enough strength and spirit to commence\r\na fresh set of experiments, and publish the results, with a full\r\nrecantation of my errors when convinced of them; but I am too old for\r\nsuch an undertaking, nor do I suppose that I shall be able to do much,\r\nor any more, original work. I imagine that I see one possible source of\r\nerror in your beautiful experiment of a plant rotating and exposed to a\r\nlateral light.\r\n\r\nWith high respect and with sincere thanks for the kind manner in which\r\nyou have treated me and my mistakes, I remain, my dear Sir, yours\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.XV. -- MISCELLANEOUS BOTANICAL LETTERS.\r\n\r\n1873-1882.\r\n\r\n[The present chapter contains a series of miscellaneous letters on\r\nbotanical subjects. Some of them show my father's varied interests in\r\nbotanical science, and others give account of researches which never\r\nreached completion.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOM ON LEAVES AND FRUIT.\r\n\r\n[His researches into the meaning of the \"bloom,\" or waxy coating found\r\non many leaves, was one of those inquiries which remained unfinished at\r\nthe time of his death. He amassed a quantity of notes on the subject,\r\npart of which I hope to publish at no distant date. (A small instalment\r\non the relation between bloom and the distribution of the stomata on\r\nleaves has appeared in the 'Journal of the Linnean Society,' 1886.\r\nTschirsch (\"Linnaea\", 1881) has published results identical with\r\nsome which my father and myself obtained, viz. that bloom diminishes\r\ntranspiration. The same fact was previously published by Garreau in\r\n1850.)\r\n\r\nOne of his earliest letters on this subject was addressed in August,\r\n1873, to Sir Joseph Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"I want a little information from you, and if you do not yourself know,\r\nplease to enquire of some of the wise men of Kew.\r\n\r\n\"Why are the leaves and fruit of so many plants protected by a thin\r\nlayer of waxy matter (like the common cabbage), or with fine hair, so\r\nthat when such leaves or fruit are immersed in water they appear as if\r\nencased in thin glass? It is really a pretty sight to put a pod of the\r\ncommon pea, or a raspberry into water. I find several leaves are thus\r\nprotected on the under surface and not on the upper.\r\n\r\n\"How can water injure the leaves if indeed this is at all the case?\"\r\n\r\nOn this latter point he wrote to Sir Thomas Farrer:--\r\n\r\n\"I am now become mad about drops of water injuring leaves. Please ask\r\nMr. Paine (Sir Thomas Farrer's gardener.) whether he believes, FROM\r\nHIS OWN EXPERIENCE, that drops of water injure leaves or fruit in his\r\nconservatories. It is said that the drops act as burning-glasses; if\r\nthis is true, they would not be at all injurious on cloudy days. As\r\nhe is so acute a man, I should very much like to hear his opinion. I\r\nremember when I grew hot-house orchids I was cautioned not to wet their\r\nleaves; but I never then thought on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"I enjoyed my visit greatly with you, and I am very sure that all\r\nEngland could not afford a kinder and pleasanter host.\"\r\n\r\nSome years later he took up the subject again, and wrote to Sir Joseph\r\nHooker (May 25, 1877):--\r\n\r\n\"I have been looking over my old notes about the \"bloom\" on plants,\r\nand I think that the subject is well worth pursuing, though I am very\r\ndoubtful of any success. Are you inclined to aid me on the mere chance\r\nof success, for without your aid I could do hardly anything?\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, June 4 [1877].\r\n\r\n... I am now trying to make out the use or function of \"bloom,\" or the\r\nwaxy secretion on the leaves and fruit of plants, but am VERY doubtful\r\nwhether I shall succeed. Can you give me any light? Are such plants\r\ncommoner in warm than in colder climates? I ask because I often walk out\r\nin heavy rain, and the leaves of very few wild dicotyledons can be here\r\nseen with drops of water rolling off them like quick-silver. Whereas in\r\nmy flower garden, greenhouse, and hot-houses there are several. Again,\r\nare bloo-protected plants common on your DRY western plains? Hooker\r\nTHINKS that they are common at the Cape of Good Hope. It is a puzzle\r\nto me if they are common under very dry climates, and I find bloom very\r\ncommon on the Acacias and Eucalypti of Australia. Some of the Eucalypti\r\nwhich do not appear to be covered with bloom have the epidermis\r\nprotected by a layer of some substance which is dissolved in boiling\r\nalcohol. Are there any bloo-protected leaves or fruit in the Arctic\r\nregions? If you can illuminate me, as you so often have done, pray do\r\nso; but otherwise do not bother yourself by answering.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W. THISELTON DYER. Down, September 5 [1877].\r\n\r\nMy dear Dyer,\r\n\r\nOne word to thank you. I declare had it not been for your kindness, we\r\nshould have broken down. As it is we have made out clearly that with\r\nsome plants (chiefly succulent) the bloom checks evaporation--with\r\nsome certainly prevents attacks of insects; with SOME sea-shore plants\r\nprevents injury from salt-water, and, I believe, with a few prevents\r\ninjury from pure water resting on the leaves. This latter is as yet\r\nthe most doubtful and the most interesting point in relation to the\r\nmovements of plants...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO F. MULLER. Down, July 4 [1881].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nYour kindness is unbounded, and I cannot tell you how much your last\r\nletter (May 31) has interested me. I have piles of notes about the\r\neffect of water resting on leaves, and their movements (as I supposed)\r\nto shake off the drops. But I have not looked over these notes for a\r\nlong time, and had come to think that perhaps my notion was mere fancy,\r\nbut I had intended to begin experimenting as soon as I returned home;\r\nand now with your INVALUABLE letter about the position of the leaves of\r\nvarious plants during rain (I have one analogous case with Acacia from\r\nSouth Africa), I shall be stimulated to work in earnest.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIABILITY.\r\n\r\n[The following letter refers to a subject on which my father felt the\r\nstrongest interest:--the experimental investigation of the causes of\r\nvariability. The experiments alluded to were to some extent planned out,\r\nand some preliminary work was begun in the direction indicated below,\r\nbut the research was ultimately abandoned.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.H. GILBERT. (Dr. Gilbert, F.R.S., joint author\r\nwith Sir John Bennett Lawes of a long series of valuable researches in\r\nScientific Agriculture.) Down, February 16, 1876.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nWhen I met you at the Linnean Society, you were so kind as to say that\r\nyou would aid me with advice, and this will be of the utmost value to me\r\nand my son. I will first state my object, and hope that you will excuse\r\na long letter. It is admitted by all naturalists that no problem is so\r\nperplexing as what causes almost every cultivated plant to vary, and no\r\nexperiments as yet tried have thrown any light on the subject. Now\r\nfor the last ten years I have been experimenting in crossing and\r\nself-fertilising plants; and one indirect result has surprised me much;\r\nnamely, that by taking pains to cultivate plants in pots under glass\r\nduring several successive generations, under nearly similar conditions,\r\nand by self-fertilising them in each generation, the colour of the\r\nflowers often changes, and, what is very remarkable, they became in some\r\nof the most variable species, such as Mimulus, Carnation, etc., quite\r\nconstant, like those of a wild species.\r\n\r\nThis fact and several others have led me to the suspicion that the cause\r\nof variation must be in different substances absorbed from the soil by\r\nthese plants when their powers of absorption are not interfered with\r\nby other plants with which they grow mingled in a state of nature.\r\nTherefore my son and I wish to grow plants in pots in soil entirely, or\r\nas nearly entirely as is possible, destitute of all matter which plants\r\nabsorb, and then to give during several successive generations to\r\nseveral plants of the same species as different solutions as may be\r\ncompatible with their life and health. And now, can you advise me how\r\nto make soil approximately free of all the substances which plants\r\nnaturally absorb? I suppose white silver sand, sold for cleaning\r\nharness, etc., is nearly pure silica, but what am I to do for alumina?\r\nWithout some alumina I imagine that it would be impossible to keep the\r\nsoil damp and fit for the growth of plants. I presume that clay washed\r\nover and over again in water would still yield mineral matter to the\r\ncarbonic acid secreted by the roots. I should want a good deal of soil,\r\nfor it would be useless to experimentise unless we could fill from\r\ntwenty to thirty moderately sized flower-pots every year. Can you\r\nsuggest any plan? for unless you can it would, I fear, be useless for us\r\nto commence an attempt to discover whether variability depends at all\r\non matter absorbed from the soil. After obtaining the requisite kind of\r\nsoil, my notion is to water one set of plants with nitrate of potassium,\r\nanother set with nitrate of sodium, and another with nitrate of lime,\r\ngiving all as much phosphate of ammonia as they seemed to support, for\r\nI wish the plants to grow as luxuriantly as possible. The plants watered\r\nwith nitrate of Na and of Ca would require, I suppose, some K; but\r\nperhaps they would get what is absolutely necessary from such soil as I\r\nshould be forced to employ, and from the rain-water collected in tanks.\r\nI could use hard water from a deep well in the chalk, but then all the\r\nplants would get lime. If the plants to which I give Nitrate of Na and\r\nof Ca would not grow I might give them a little alum.\r\n\r\nI am well aware how very ignorant I am, and how crude my notions are;\r\nand if you could suggest any other solutions by which plants would be\r\nlikely to be affected it would be a very great kindness. I suppose that\r\nthere are no organic fluids which plants would absorb, and which I could\r\nprocure?\r\n\r\nI must trust to your kindness to excuse me for troubling you at such\r\nlength, and,\r\n\r\nI remain, dear Sir, yours sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The next letter to Professor Semper (Professor of Zoology at Wurzburg.)\r\nbears on the same subject:]\r\n\r\nFROM CHARLES DARWIN TO K. SEMPER. Down, July 19, 1881.\r\n\r\nMy dear Professor Semper,\r\n\r\nI have been much pleased to receive your letter, but I did not expect\r\nyou to answer my former one... I cannot remember what I wrote to you,\r\nbut I am sure that it must have expressed the interest which I felt in\r\nreading your book. (Published in the 'International Scientific Series,'\r\nin 1881, under the title, 'The Natural Conditions of Existence as they\r\naffect Animal Life.') I thought that you attributed too much weight to\r\nthe DIRECT action of the environment; but whether I said so I know not,\r\nfor without being asked I should have thought it presumptuous to have\r\ncriticised your book, nor should I now say so had I not during the last\r\nfew days been struck with Professor Hoffmann's review of his own work in\r\nthe 'Botanische Zeitung,' on the variability of plants; and it is really\r\nsurprising how little effect he produced by cultivating certain plants\r\nunder unnatural conditions, as the presence of salt, lime, zinc, etc.,\r\netc., during SEVERAL generations. Plants, moreover, were selected which\r\nwere the most likely to vary under such conditions, judging from the\r\nexistence of closely-allied forms adapted for these conditions. No\r\ndoubt I originally attributed too little weight to the direct action of\r\nconditions, but Hoffmann's paper has staggered me. Perhaps hundreds of\r\ngenerations of exposure are necessary. It is a most perplexing subject.\r\nI wish I was not so old, and had more strength, for I see lines of\r\nresearch to follow. Hoffmann even doubts whether plants vary more\r\nunder cultivation than in their native home and under their natural\r\nconditions. If so, the astonishing variations of almost all cultivated\r\nplants must be due to selection and breeding from the varying\r\nindividuals. This idea crossed my mind many years ago, but I was\r\nafraid to publish it, as I thought that people would say, \"how he does\r\nexaggerate the importance of selection.\"\r\n\r\nI still MUST believe that changed conditions give the impulse to\r\nvariability, but that they act IN MOST CASES in a very indirect manner.\r\nBut, as I said, it is a most perplexing problem. Pray forgive me for\r\nwriting at such length; I had no intention of doing so when I sat down\r\nto write.\r\n\r\nI am extremely sorry to hear, for your own sake and for that of Science,\r\nthat you are so hard worked, and that so much of your time is consumed\r\nin official labour.\r\n\r\nPray believe me, dear Professor Semper, Yours sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALLS.\r\n\r\n[Shortly before his death, my father began to experimentise on the\r\npossibility of producing galls artificially. A letter to Sir J.D. Hooker\r\n(November 3, 1880) shows the interest which he felt in the question:--\r\n\r\n\"I was delighted with Paget's Essay ('Disease in Plants,' by Sir\r\nJames Paget.--See \"Gardeners' Chronicle\", 1880.); I hear that he has\r\noccasionally attended to this subject from his youth... I am very glad he\r\nhas called attention to galls: this has always seemed to me a profoundly\r\ninteresting subject; and if I had been younger would take it up.\"\r\n\r\nHis interest in this subject was connected with his ever-present wish\r\nto learn something of the causes of variation. He imagined to himself\r\nwonderful galls caused to appear on the ovaries of plants, and by these\r\nmeans he thought it possible that the seed might be influenced, and thus\r\nnew varieties arise. He made a considerable number of experiments by\r\ninjecting various reagents into the tissues of leaves, and with some\r\nslight indications of success.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAGGREGATION.\r\n\r\n[The following letter gives an idea of the subject of the last of his\r\npublished papers. ('Journal of the Linnean Society.' volume xix, 1882,\r\npages 239 and 262.) The appearances which he observed in leaves and\r\nroots attracted him, on account of their relation to the phenomena of\r\naggregation which had so deeply interested him when he was at work on\r\nDrosera:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO S.H. VINES. (Reader in Botany in the University of\r\nCambridge.) Down, November 1, 1881.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Vines,\r\n\r\nAs I know how busy you are, it is a great shame to trouble you. But you\r\nare so rich in chemical knowledge about plants, and I am so poor, that\r\nI appeal to your charity as a pauper. My question is--Do you know of\r\nany solid substance in the cells of plants which glycerine and water\r\ndissolves? But you will understand my perplexity better if I give you\r\nthe facts: I mentioned to you that if a plant of Euphorbia peplus is\r\ngently dug up and the roots placed for a short time in a weak solution\r\n(1 to 10,000 of water, suffices in 24 hours) of carbonate of ammonia the\r\n(generally) alternate longitudinal rows of cells in every rootlet, from\r\nthe root-cap up to the very top of the root (but not as far as I have\r\nyet seen in the green stem) become filled with translucent, brownish\r\ngrains of matter. These rounded grains often cohere and even become\r\nconfluent. Pure phosphate and nitrate of ammonia produce (though more\r\nslowly) the same effect, as does pure carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\nNow, if slices of root under a cover-glass are irrigated with glycerine\r\nand water, every one of the innumerable grains in the cells disappear\r\nafter some hours. What am I to think of this.?...\r\n\r\nForgive me for bothering you to such an extent; but I must mention\r\nthat if the roots are dipped in boiling water there is no deposition of\r\nmatter, and carbonate of ammonia afterwards produces no effect. I should\r\nstate that I now find that the granular matter is formed in the cells\r\nimmediately beneath the thin epidermis, and a few other cells near the\r\nvascular tissue. If the granules consisted of living protoplasm (but\r\nI can see no traces of movement in them), then I should infer that\r\nthe glycerine killed them and aggregation ceased with the diffusion of\r\ninvisibly minute particles, for I have seen an analogous phenomenon in\r\nDrosera.\r\n\r\nIf you can aid me, pray do so, and anyhow forgive me. Yours very\r\nsincerely, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. TORBITT'S EXPERIMENTS ON THE POTATO-DISEASE.\r\n\r\n[Mr. James Torbitt, of Belfast, has been engaged for the last twelve\r\nyears in the difficult undertaking, in which he has been to a large\r\nextent successful, of raising fungus-proof varieties of the potato. My\r\nfather felt great interest in Mr. Torbitt's work, and corresponded with\r\nhim from 1876 onwards. The following letter, giving a clear account of\r\nMr. Torbitt's method and of my father's opinion of the probability of\r\nits success, was written with the idea that Government aid for the work\r\nmight possibly be obtainable:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. FARRER. Down, March 2, 1878.\r\n\r\nMy dear Farrer,\r\n\r\nMr. Torbitt's plan of overcoming the potato-disease seems to me by far\r\nthe best which has ever been suggested. It consists, as you know\r\nfrom his printed letter, of rearing a vast number of seedlings from\r\ncross-fertilised parents, exposing them to infection, ruthlessly\r\ndestroying all that suffer, saving those which resist best, and\r\nrepeating the process in successive seminal generations. My belief in\r\nthe probability of good results from this process rests on the fact of\r\nall characters whatever occasionally varying. It is known, for instance,\r\nthat certain species and varieties of the vine resist phylloxera better\r\nthan others. Andrew Knight found in one variety or species of the apple\r\nwhich was not in the least attacked by coccus, and another variety has\r\nbeen observed in South Australia. Certain varieties of the peach resist\r\nmildew, and several other such cases could be given. Therefore there is\r\nno great improbability in a new variety of potato arising which would\r\nresist the fungus completely, or at least much better than any existing\r\nvariety. With respect to the cross-fertilisation of two distinct\r\nseedling plants, it has been ascertained that the offspring thus raised\r\ninherit much more vigorous constitutions and generally are more prolific\r\nthan seedlings from self-fertilised parents. It is also probable that\r\ncross-fertilisation would be especially valuable in the case of the\r\npotato, as there is reason to believe that the flowers are seldom\r\ncrossed by our native insects; and some varieties are absolutely sterile\r\nunless fertilised with pollen from a distinct variety. There is some\r\nevidence that the good effects from a cross are transmitted for several\r\ngenerations; it would not, therefore be necessary to cross-fertilise the\r\nseedlings in each generation, though this would be desirable, as it is\r\nalmost certain that a greater number of seeds would thus be obtained. It\r\nshould be remembered that a cross between plants raised from the tubers\r\nof the same plant, though growing on distinct roots, does no more good\r\nthan a cross between flowers on the same individual. Considering the\r\nwhole subject, it appears to me that it would be a national misfortune\r\nif the cros-fertilised seeds in Mr. Torbitt's possession produced by\r\nparents which have already shown some power of resisting the disease,\r\nare not utilised by the Government, or some public body, and the process\r\nof selection continued during several more generations.\r\n\r\nShould the Agricultural Society undertake the work, Mr. Torbitt's\r\nknowledge gained by experience would be especially valuable; and\r\nan outline of the plan is given in his printed letter. It would be\r\nnecessary that all the tubers produced by each plant should be collected\r\nseparately, and carefully examined in each succeeding generation.\r\n\r\nIt would be advisable that some kind of potato eminently liable to the\r\ndisease should be planted in considerable numbers near the seedlings so\r\nas to infect them.\r\n\r\nAltogether the trial would be one requiring much care and extreme\r\npatience, as I know from experience with analogous work, and it may be\r\nfeared that it would be difficult to find any one who would pursue the\r\nexperiment with sufficient energy. It seems, therefore, to me highly\r\ndesirable that Mr. Torbitt should be aided with some small grant so as\r\nto continue the work himself.\r\n\r\nJudging from his reports, his efforts have already been crowned in so\r\nshort a time with more success than could have been anticipated; and\r\nI think you will agree with me, that any one who raises a fungus-proof\r\npotato will be a public benefactor of no common kind.\r\n\r\nMy dear Farrer, yours sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[After further consultation with Sir Thomas Farrer and with Mr. Caird,\r\nmy father became convinced that it was hopeless to attempt to obtain\r\nGovernment aid. He wrote to Mr. Torbitt to this effect, adding, \"it\r\nwould be less trouble to get up a subscription from a few rich leading\r\nagriculturists than from Government. This plan I think you cannot object\r\nto, as you have asked nothing, and will have nothing whatever to do with\r\nthe subscription. In fact, the affair is, in my opinion, a compliment\r\nto you.\" The idea here broached was carried out, and Mr. Torbitt was\r\nenabled to continue his work by the aid of a sum to which Sir T. Farrer,\r\nMr. Caird, my father, and a few friends, subscribed.\r\n\r\nMy father's sympathy and encouragement were highly valued by Mr.\r\nTorbitt, who tells me that without them he should long ago have given up\r\nhis attempt. A few extracts will illustrate my father's fellow feeling\r\nwith Mr. Torbitt's energy and perseverance:--\r\n\r\n\"I admire your indomitable spirit. If any one ever deserved success,\r\nyou do so, and I keep to my original opinion that you have a very good\r\nchance of raising a fungus-proof variety of the potato.\r\n\r\n\"A pioneer in a new undertaking is sure to meet with many\r\ndisappointments, so I hope that you will keep up your courage, though we\r\nhave done so very little for you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Torbitt tells me that he still (1887) succeeds in raising varieties\r\npossessing well-marked powers of resisting disease; but this immunity is\r\nnot permanent, and, after some years, the varieties become liable to the\r\nattacks of the fungus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KEW INDEX OF PLANT-NAMES, OR 'NOMENCLATOR DARWINIANUS.'\r\n\r\n[Some account of my father's connection with the Index of Plant-names\r\nnow (1887) in course of preparation at Kew will be found in Mr. B.\r\nDaydon Jackson's paper in the 'Journal of Botany,' 1887, page 151. Mr.\r\nJackson quotes the following statement by Sir J.D. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"Shortly before his death, Mr. Charles Darwin informed Sir Joseph Hooker\r\nthat it was his intention to devote a considerable sum of money annually\r\nfor some years in aid or furtherance of some work or works of practical\r\nutility to biological science, and to make provisions in his will in the\r\nevent of these not being completed during his lifetime.\r\n\r\n\"Amongst other objects connected with botanical science, Mr. Darwin\r\nregarded with especial interest the importance of a complete index\r\nto the names and authors of the genera and species of plants known to\r\nbotanists, together with their native countries. Steudel's 'Nomenclator'\r\nis the only existing work of this nature, and although now nearly half a\r\ncentury old, Mr. Darwin had found it of great aid in his own researches.\r\nIt has been indispensable to every botanical institution, whether as a\r\nlist of all known flowering plants, as an indication of their authors,\r\nor as a digest of botanical geography.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSince 1840, when the 'Nomenclator' was published, the number of\r\ndescribed plants may be said to have doubled, so that the 'Nomenclator'\r\nis now seriously below the requirements of botanical work. To remedy\r\nthis want, the 'Nomenclator' has been from time to time posted up in an\r\ninterleaved copy in the Herbarium at Kew, by the help of \"funds supplied\r\nby private liberality.\" (Kew Gardens Report, 1881, page 62.)\r\n\r\nMy father, like other botanists, had as Sir Joseph Hooker points out,\r\nexperienced the value of Steudel's work. He obtained plants from all\r\nsorts of sources, which were often incorrectly named, and he felt the\r\nnecessity of adhering to the accepted nomenclature, so that he might\r\nconvey to other workers precise indications as to the plants which he\r\nhad studied. It was also frequently a matter of importance to him to\r\nknow the native country of his experimental plants. Thus it was natural\r\nthat he should recognize the desirability of completing and publishing\r\nthe interleaved volume at Kew. The wish to help in this object was\r\nheightened by the admiration he felt for the results for which the world\r\nhas to thank the Royal Gardens at Kew, and by his gratitude for the\r\ninvaluable aid which for so many years he received from its Director and\r\nhis staff. He expressly stated that it was his wish \"to aid in some\r\nway the scientific work carried on at the Royal Gardens\" (Kew Gardens\r\nReport, 1881, page 62.)--which induced him to offer to supply funds for\r\nthe completion of the Kew 'Nomenclator.'\r\n\r\nThe following passage, for which I am indebted to Professor Judd, is of\r\nmuch interest, as illustrating the motives that actuated my father in\r\nthis matter. Professor Judd writes:--\r\n\r\n\"On the occasion of my last visit to him, he told me that his income\r\nhaving recently greatly increased, while his wants remained the same,\r\nhe was most anxious to devote what he could spare to the advancement\r\nof Geology or Biology. He dwelt in the most touching manner on the fact\r\nthat he owed so much happiness and fame to the natural-history\r\nsciences, which had been the solace of what might have been a painful\r\nexistence;--and he begged me, if I knew of any research which could be\r\naided by a grant of a few hundreds of pounds, to let him know, as it\r\nwould be a delight to him to feel that he was helping in promoting the\r\nprogress of science. He informed me at the same time that he was making\r\nthe same suggestion to Sir Joseph Hooker and Professor Huxley with\r\nrespect to Botany and Zoology respectively. I was much impressed by\r\nthe earnestness, and, indeed, deep emotion, with which he spoke of his\r\nindebtedness to Science, and his desire to promote its interests.\"\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Hooker was asked by my father \"to take into consideration,\r\nwith the aid of the botanical staff at Kew and the late Mr. Bentham, the\r\nextent and scope of the proposed work, and to suggest the best means of\r\nhaving it executed. In doing this, Sir Joseph had further the advantage\r\nof the great knowledge and experience of Professor Asa Gray, of\r\nCambridge, U.S.A., and of Mr. John Ball, F.R.S.\" ('Journal of Botany,'\r\nloc. cit.)\r\n\r\nThe plan of the proposed work having been carefully considered, Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker was able to confide its elaboration in detail to Mr.\r\nB. Daydon Jackson, Secretary of the Linnean Society, whose extensive\r\nknowledge of botanical literature qualifies him for the task. My\r\nfather's original idea of producing a modern edition of Steudel's\r\n'Nomenclator' has been practically abandoned, the aim now kept in view\r\nis rather to construct a list of genera and species (with references)\r\nfounded on Bentham and Hooker's 'Genera Plantarum.' The colossal nature\r\nof the work in progress at Kew may be estimated by the fact that the\r\nmanuscript of the 'Index' is at the present time (1887) believed to\r\nweigh more than a ton. Under Sir Joseph Hooker's supervision the work\r\ngoes steadily forward, being carried out with admirable zeal by Mr.\r\nJackson, who devotes himself unsparingly to the enterprise, in which,\r\ntoo, he has the advantage of the active interest in the work felt by\r\nProfessor Oliver and Mr. Thiselton Dyer.\r\n\r\nThe Kew 'Index,' which will, in all probability, be ready to go to press\r\nin four or five years, will be a fitting memorial of my father: and his\r\nshare in its completion illustrates a part of his character--his ready\r\nsympathy with work outside his own lines of investigation--and his\r\nrespect for minute and patient labour in all branches of science.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.XVI. -- CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the general course of my father's health may have been\r\ngathered from the letters given in the preceding pages. The subject of\r\nhealth appears more prominently than is often necessary in a Biography,\r\nbecause it was, unfortunately, so real an element in determining the\r\noutward form of his life.\r\n\r\nDuring the last ten years of his life the condition of his health was a\r\ncause of satisfaction and hope to his family. His condition showed\r\nsigns of amendment in several particulars. He suffered less distress\r\nand discomfort, and was able to work more steadily. Something has\r\nbeen already said of Dr. Bence Jones's treatment, from which my father\r\ncertainly derived benefit. In later years he became a patient of Sir\r\nAndrew Clark, under whose care he improved greatly in general health. It\r\nwas not only for his generously rendered service that my father felt\r\na debt of gratitude towards Sir Andrew Clark. He owed to his cheering\r\npersonal influence an ofte-repeated encouragement, which laterally added\r\nsomething real to his happiness, and he found sincere pleasure in Sir\r\nAndrew's friendship and kindness towards himself and his children.\r\n\r\nScattered through the past pages are one or two references to pain or\r\nuneasiness felt in the region of the heart. How far these indicate that\r\nthe heart was affected early in life, I cannot pretend to say; in any\r\ncase it is certain that he had no serious or permanent trouble of\r\nthis nature until shortly before his death. In spite of the general\r\nimprovement in his health, which has been above alluded to, there was\r\na certain loss of physical vigour occasionally apparent during the last\r\nfew years of his life. This is illustrated by a sentence in a letter\r\nto his old friend Sir James Sulivan, written on January 10, 1879: \"My\r\nscientific work tires me more than it used to do, but I have nothing\r\nelse to do, and whether one is worn out a year or two sooner or later\r\nsignifies but little.\"\r\n\r\nA similar feeling is shown in a letter to Sir J.D. Hooker of June 15,\r\n1881. My father was staying at Patterdale, and wrote: \"I am rather\r\ndespondent about myself... I have not the heart or strength to begin any\r\ninvestigation lasting years, which is the only thing which I enjoy, and\r\nI have no little jobs which I can do.\"\r\n\r\nIn July, 1881, he wrote to Mr. Wallace, \"We have just returned home\r\nafter spending five weeks on Ullswater; the scenery is quite charming,\r\nbut I cannot walk, and everything tires me, even seeing scenery... What\r\nI shall do with my few remaining years of life I can hardly tell. I\r\nhave everything to make me happy and contented, but life has become very\r\nwearisome to me.\" He was, however, able to do a good deal of work, and\r\nthat of a trying sort (On the action of carbonate of ammonia on roots\r\nand leaves.), during the autumn of 1881, but towards the end of the year\r\nhe was clearly in need of rest; and during the winter was in a lower\r\ncondition than was usual with him.\r\n\r\nOn December 13 he went for a week to his daughter's house in Bryanston\r\nStreet. During his stay in London he went to call on Mr. Romanes, and\r\nwas seized when on the door-step with an attack apparently of the same\r\nkind as those which afterwards became so frequent. The rest of the\r\nincident, which I give in Mr. Romanes' words, is interesting too from a\r\ndifferent point of view, as giving one more illustration of my father's\r\nscrupulous consideration for others:--\r\n\r\n\"I happened to be out, but my butler, observing that Mr. Darwin was ill,\r\nasked him to come in, he said he would prefer going home, and although\r\nthe butler urged him to wait at least until a cab could be fetched, he\r\nsaid he would rather not give so much trouble. For the same reason he\r\nrefused to allow the butler to accompany him. Accordingly he watched him\r\nwalking with difficulty towards the direction in which cabs were to be\r\nmet with, and saw that, when he had got about three hundred yards from\r\nthe house, he staggered and caught hold of the park-railings as if\r\nto prevent himself from falling. The butler therefore hastened to his\r\nassistance, but after a few seconds saw him turn round with the evident\r\npurpose of retracing his steps to my house. However, after he had\r\nreturned part of the way he seems to have felt better, for he again\r\nchanged his mind, and proceeded to find a cab.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the last week of February and in the beginning of March, attacks\r\nof pain in the region of the heart, with irregularity of the pulse,\r\nbecame frequent, coming on indeed nearly every afternoon. A seizure of\r\nthis sort occurred about March 7, when he was walking alone at a short\r\ndistance from the house; he got home with difficulty, and this was the\r\nlast time that he was able to reach his favourite 'Sand-walk.' Shortly\r\nafter this, his illness became obviously more serious and alarming, and\r\nhe was seen by Sir Andrew Clark, whose treatment was continued by Dr.\r\nNorman Moore, of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and Mr. Alfrey, of St.\r\nMary Cray. He suffered from distressing sensations of exhaustion and\r\nfaintness, and seemed to recognise with deep depression the fact that\r\nhis working days were over. He gradually recovered from this condition,\r\nand became more cheerful and hopeful, as is shown in the following\r\nletter to Mr. Huxley, who was anxious that my father should have closer\r\nmedical supervision than the existing arrangements allowed:\r\n\r\n\r\nDown, March 27, 1882.\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nYour most kind letter has been a real cordial to me. I have felt better\r\nto-day than for three weeks, and have felt as yet no pain. Your plan\r\nseems an excellent one, and I will probably act upon it, unless I get\r\nvery much better. Dr. Clark's kindness is unbounded to me, but he is\r\ntoo busy to come here. Once again, accept my cordial thanks, my dear old\r\nfriend. I wish to God there were more automata (The allusion is to Mr.\r\nHuxley's address 'On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its\r\nHistory,' given at the Belfast meeting of the British Association in\r\n1874, and republished in 'Science and Culture.') in the world like you.\r\n\r\nEver yours, CH. DARWIN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe allusion to Sir Andrew Clark requires a word of explanation. Sir\r\nAndrew Clark himself was ever ready to devote himself to my father, who,\r\nhowever, could not endure the thought of sending for him, knowing how\r\nseverely his great practice taxed his strength.\r\n\r\nNo especial change occurred during the beginning of April, but on\r\nSaturday 15th he was seized with giddiness while sitting at dinner in\r\nthe evening, and fainted in an attempt to reach his sofa. On the 17th\r\nhe was again better, and in my temporary absence recorded for me the\r\nprogress of an experiment in which I was engaged. During the night of\r\nApril 18th, about a quarter to twelve, he had a severe attack and passed\r\ninto a faint, from which he was brought back to consciousness with great\r\ndifficulty. He seemed to recognise the approach of death, and said, \"I\r\nam not the least afraid to die.\" All the next morning he suffered from\r\nterrible nausea and faintness, and hardly rallied before the end came.\r\n\r\nHe died at about four o'clock on Wednesday, April 19th, 1882, in the\r\nseventy-fourth year of his age.\r\n\r\nI close the record of my father's life with a few words of retrospect\r\nadded to the manuscript of his 'Autobiography' in 1879:--\r\n\r\n\"As for myself, I believe that I have acted rightly in steadily\r\nfollowing, and devoting my life to Science. I feel no remorse from\r\nhaving committed any great sin, but have often and often regretted that\r\nI have not done more direct good to my fellow creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\nTHE FUNERAL IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Friday succeeding my father's death, the following letter, signed\r\nby twenty members of Parliament, was addressed to Dr. Bradley, Dean of\r\nWestminster:--\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, April 21, 1882.\r\n\r\nVery Rev. Sir,\r\n\r\nWe hope you will not think we are taking a liberty if we venture to\r\nsuggest that it would be acceptable to a very large number of our\r\nfellow-countrymen of all classes and opinions that our illustrious\r\ncountryman, Mr. Darwin, should be buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nWe remain, your obedient servants,\r\n\r\nJOHN LUBBOCK, NEVIL STOREY MASKELYNE, A.J. MUNDELLA, G.O. TREVELYAN,\r\nLYON PLAYFAIR, CHARLES W. DILKE, DAVID WEDDERBURN, ARTHUR RUSSEL, HORACE\r\nDAVEY, BENJAMIN ARMITAGE, RICHARD B. MARTIN, FRANCIS W. BUXTON, E.L.\r\nSTANLEY, HENRY BROADHURST, JOHN BARRAN, F.J. CHEETHAM, H.S. HOLLAND, H.\r\nCAMPBELL-BANNERMAN, CHARLES BRUCE, RICHARD FORT.\r\n\r\nThe Dean was abroad at the time, and telegraphed his cordial\r\nacquiescence.\r\n\r\nThe family had desired that my father should be buried at Down: with\r\nregard to their wishes, Sir John Lubbock wrote:--\r\n\r\nHOUSE OF COMMONS, April 25, 1882.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nI quite sympathise with your feeling, and personally I should greatly\r\nhave preferred that your father should have rested in Down amongst us\r\nall. It is, I am sure, quite understood that the initiative was not\r\ntaken by you. Still, from a national point of view, it is clearly right\r\nthat he should be buried in the Abbey. I esteem it a great privilege to\r\nbe allowed to accompany my dear master to the grave.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\nJOHN LUBBOCK.\r\n\r\nW.E. DARWIN, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family gave up their first-formed plans, and the funeral took place\r\nin Westminster Abbey on April 26th. The pall-bearers were:--\r\n\r\n  SIR JOHN LUBBOCK,\r\n  MR. HUXLEY,\r\n  MR. JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL (American Minister),\r\n  MR. A.R. WALLACE,\r\n  THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE,\r\n  CANON FARRAR,\r\n  SIR J.D. HOOKER,\r\n  MR. WM. SPOTTISWOODE (President of the Royal Society),\r\n  THE EARL OF DERBY,\r\n  THE DUKE OF ARGYLL.\r\n\r\nThe funeral was attended by the representatives of France, Germany,\r\nItaly, Spain, Russia, and by those of the Universities, and learned\r\nSocieties, as well as by large numbers of personal friends and\r\ndistinguished men.\r\n\r\nThe grave is in the North aisle of the Nave close to the angle of the\r\nchoir-screen, and a few feet from the grave of Sir Isaac Newton. The\r\nstone bears the inscription--\r\n\r\nCHARLES ROBERT DARWIN. Born 12 February, 1809.
