Frank Baum\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor’s Note\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of “The Wonderful Wizard of OZ” I began to\r\nreceive letters from children, telling me of their pleasure in reading\r\nthe story and asking me to “write something more” about the Scarecrow\r\nand the Tin Woodman. At first I considered these little letters, frank\r\nand earnest though they were, in the light of pretty compliments; but\r\nthe letters continued to come during succeeding months, and even years.\r\n\r\nFinally I promised one little girl, who made a long journey to see me\r\nand prefer her request,—and she is a “Dorothy,” by the way—that when a\r\nthousand little girls had written me a thousand little letters asking\r\nfor the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman I would write the book, Either\r\nlittle Dorothy was a fairy in disguise, and waved her magic wand, or\r\nthe success of the stage production of “The Wizard of OZ” made new\r\nfriends for the story, For the thousand letters reached their\r\ndestination long since—and many more followed them.\r\n\r\nAnd now, although pleading guilty to long delay, I have kept my promise\r\nin this book.\r\n\r\nL.

There was more to his name than that, for\r\nold Mombi often declared that his whole name was Tippetarius; but no\r\none was expected to say such a long word when “Tip” would do just as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThis boy remembered nothing of his parents, for he had been brought\r\nwhen quite young to be reared by the old woman known as Mombi, whose\r\nreputation, I am sorry to say, was none of the best. For the Gillikin\r\npeople had reason to suspect her of indulging in magical arts, and\r\ntherefore hesitated to associate with her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image016]\r\n\r\nMombi was not exactly a Witch, because the Good Witch who ruled that\r\npart of the Land of Oz had forbidden any other Witch to exist in her\r\ndominions. So Tip’s guardian, however much she might aspire to working\r\nmagic, realized it was unlawful to be more than a Sorceress, or at most\r\na Wizardess.\r\n\r\nTip was made to carry wood from the forest, that the old woman might\r\nboil her pot. He also worked in the corn-fields, hoeing and husking;\r\nand he fed the pigs and milked the four-horned cow that was Mombi’s\r\nespecial pride.\r\n\r\nBut you must not suppose he worked all the time, for he felt that would\r\nbe bad for him. When sent to the forest Tip often climbed trees for\r\nbirds’ eggs or amused himself chasing the fleet white rabbits or\r\nfishing in the brooks with bent pins. Then he would hastily gather his\r\narmful of wood and carry it home. And when he was supposed to be\r\nworking in the corn-fields, and the tall stalks hid him from Mombi’s\r\nview, Tip would often dig in the gopher holes, or if the mood seized\r\nhim—lie upon his back between the rows of corn and take a nap. So, by\r\ntaking care not to exhaust his strength, he grew as strong and rugged\r\nas a boy may be.\r\n\r\nMombi’s curious magic often frightened her neighbors, and they treated\r\nher shyly, yet respectfully, because of her weird powers. But Tip\r\nfrankly hated her, and took no pains to hide his feelings. Indeed, he\r\nsometimes showed less respect for the old woman than he should have\r\ndone, considering she was his guardian.\r\n\r\nThere were pumpkins in Mombi’s corn-fields, lying golden red among the\r\nrows of green stalks; and these had been planted and carefully tended\r\nthat the four-horned cow might eat of them in the winter time. But one\r\nday, after the corn had all been cut and stacked, and Tip was carrying\r\nthe pumpkins to the stable, he took a notion to make a “Jack Lantern”\r\nand try to give the old woman a fright with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image017]\r\n\r\nSo he selected a fine, big pumpkin—one with a lustrous, orange-red\r\ncolor—and began carving it. With the point of his knife he made two\r\nround eyes, a three-cornered nose, and a mouth shaped like a new moon.\r\nThe face, when completed, could not have been considered strictly\r\nbeautiful; but it wore a smile so big and broad, and was so Jolly in\r\nexpression, that even Tip laughed as he looked admiringly at his work.\r\n\r\nThe child had no playmates, so he did not know that boys often dig out\r\nthe inside of a “pumpkin-jack,” and in the space thus made put a\r\nlighted candle to render the face more startling; but he conceived an\r\nidea of his own that promised to be quite as effective. He decided to\r\nmanufacture the form of a man, who would wear this pumpkin head, and to\r\nstand it in a place where old Mombi would meet it face to face.\r\n\r\n“And then,” said Tip to himself, with a laugh, “she’ll squeal louder\r\nthan the brown pig does when I pull her tail, and shiver with fright\r\nworse than I did last year when I had the ague!”\r\n\r\nHe had plenty of time to accomplish this task, for Mombi had gone to a\r\nvillage—to buy groceries, she said—and it was a journey of at least two\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image019]\r\n\r\nSo he took his axe to the forest, and selected some stout, straight\r\nsaplings, which he cut down and trimmed of all their twigs and leaves.\r\nFrom these he would make the arms, and legs, and feet of his man. For\r\nthe body he stripped a sheet of thick bark from around a big tree, and\r\nwith much labor fashioned it into a cylinder of about the right size,\r\npinning the edges together with wooden pegs. Then, whistling happily as\r\nhe worked, he carefully jointed the limbs and fastened them to the body\r\nwith pegs whittled into shape with his knife.\r\n\r\nBy the time this feat had been accomplished it began to grow dark, and\r\nTip remembered he must milk the cow and feed the pigs. So he picked up\r\nhis wooden man and carried it back to the house with him.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening, by the light of the fire in the kitchen, Tip\r\ncarefully rounded all the edges of the joints and smoothed the rough\r\nplaces in a neat and workmanlike manner. Then he stood the figure up\r\nagainst the wall and admired it. It seemed remarkably tall, even for a\r\nfull-grown man; but that was a good point in a small boy’s eyes, and\r\nTip did not object at all to the size of his creation.\r\n\r\nNext morning, when he looked at his work again, Tip saw he had\r\nforgotten to give the dummy a neck, by means of which he might fasten\r\nthe pumpkinhead to the body. So he went again to the forest, which was\r\nnot far away, and chopped from a tree several pieces of wood with which\r\nto complete his work. When he returned he fastened a cross-piece to the\r\nupper end of the body, making a hole through the center to hold upright\r\nthe neck. The bit of wood which formed this neck was also sharpened at\r\nthe upper end, and when all was ready Tip put on the pumpkin head,\r\npressing it well down onto the neck, and found that it fitted very\r\nwell. The head could be turned to one side or the other, as he pleased,\r\nand the hinges of the arms and legs allowed him to place the dummy in\r\nany position he desired.\r\n\r\n“Now, that,” declared Tip, proudly, “is really a very fine man, and it\r\nought to frighten several screeches out of old Mombi! But it would be\r\nmuch more lifelike if it were properly dressed.”\r\n\r\nTo find clothing seemed no easy task; but Tip boldly ransacked the\r\ngreat chest in which Mombi kept all her keepsakes and treasures, and at\r\nthe very bottom he discovered some purple trousers, a red shirt and a\r\npink vest which was dotted with white spots. These he carried away to\r\nhis man and succeeded, although the garments did not fit very well, in\r\ndressing the creature in a jaunty fashion. Some knit stockings\r\nbelonging to Mombi and a much worn pair of his own shoes completed the\r\nman’s apparel, and Tip was so delighted that he danced up and down and\r\nlaughed aloud in boyish ecstacy.\r\n\r\n“I must give him a name!” he cried. “So good a man as this must surely\r\nhave a name. I believe,” he added, after a moment’s thought, “I will\r\nname the fellow ‘Jack Pumpkinhead!’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image023]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image024]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image025]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Marvelous Powder of Life\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter considering the matter carefully, Tip decided that the best place\r\nto locate Jack would be at the bend in the road, a little way from the\r\nhouse. So he started to carry his man there, but found him heavy and\r\nrather awkward to handle. After dragging the creature a short distance\r\nTip stood him on his feet, and by first bending the joints of one leg,\r\nand then those of the other, at the same time pushing from behind, the\r\nboy managed to induce Jack to walk to the bend in the road. It was not\r\naccomplished without a few tumbles, and Tip really worked harder than\r\nhe ever had in the fields or forest; but a love of mischief urged him\r\non, and it pleased him to test the cleverness of his workmanship.\r\n\r\n“Jack’s all right, and works fine!” he said to himself, panting with\r\nthe unusual exertion. But just then he discovered the man’s left arm\r\nhad fallen off in the journey so he went back to find it, and\r\nafterward, by whittling a new and stouter pin for the shoulder-joint,\r\nhe repaired the injury so successfully that the arm was stronger than\r\nbefore. Tip also noticed that Jack’s pumpkin head had twisted around\r\nuntil it faced his back; but this was easily remedied. When, at last,\r\nthe man was set up facing the turn in the path where old Mombi was to\r\nappear, he looked natural enough to be a fair imitation of a Gillikin\r\nfarmer,—and unnatural enough to startle anyone that came on him\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\nAs it was yet too early in the day to expect the old woman to return\r\nhome, Tip went down into the valley below the farm-house and began to\r\ngather nuts from the trees that grew there.\r\n\r\nHowever, old Mombi returned earlier than usual. She had met a crooked\r\nwizard who resided in a lonely cave in the mountains, and had traded\r\nseveral important secrets of magic with him. Having in this way secured\r\nthree new recipes, four magical powders and a selection of herbs of\r\nwonderful power and potency, she hobbled home as fast as she could, in\r\norder to test her new sorceries.\r\n\r\nSo intent was Mombi on the treasures she had gained that when she\r\nturned the bend in the road and caught a glimpse of the man, she merely\r\nnodded and said:\r\n\r\n“Good evening, sir.”\r\n\r\nBut, a moment after, noting that the person did not move or reply, she\r\ncast a shrewd glance into his face and discovered his pumpkin head\r\nelaborately carved by Tip’s jack-knife.\r\n\r\n“Heh!” ejaculated Mombi, giving a sort of grunt; “that rascally boy has\r\nbeen playing tricks again! Very good! ve—ry _good!_ I’ll beat him\r\nblack-and-blue for trying to scare me in this fashion!”\r\n\r\nAngrily she raised her stick to smash in the grinning pumpkin head of\r\nthe dummy; but a sudden thought made her pause, the uplifted stick left\r\nmotionless in the air.\r\n\r\n“Why, here is a good chance to try my new powder!” said she, eagerly.\r\n“And then I can tell whether that crooked wizard has fairly traded\r\nsecrets, or whether he has fooled me as wickedly as I fooled him.”\r\n\r\nSo she set down her basket and began fumbling in it for one of the\r\nprecious powders she had obtained.\r\n\r\nWhile Mombi was thus occupied Tip strolled back, with his pockets full\r\nof nuts, and discovered the old woman standing beside his man and\r\napparently not the least bit frightened by it.\r\n\r\nAt first he was generally disappointed; but the next moment he became\r\ncurious to know what Mombi was going to do. So he hid behind a hedge,\r\nwhere he could see without being seen, and prepared to watch.\r\n\r\nAfter some search the woman drew from her basket an old pepper-box,\r\nupon the faded label of which the wizard had written with a\r\nlead-pencil:\r\n\r\n“Powder of Life.”\r\n\r\n“Ah—here it is!” she cried, joyfully. “And now let us see if it is\r\npotent. The stingy wizard didn’t give me much of it, but I guess\r\nthere’s enough for two or three doses.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image029]\r\n\r\nTip was much surprised when he overheard this speech. Then he saw old\r\nMombi raise her arm and sprinkle the powder from the box over the\r\npumpkin head of his man Jack. She did this in the same way one would\r\npepper a baked potato, and the powder sifted down from Jack’s head and\r\nscattered over the red shirt and pink waistcoat and purple trousers Tip\r\nhad dressed him in, and a portion even fell upon the patched and worn\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nThen, putting the pepper-box back into the basket, Mombi lifted her\r\nleft hand, with its little finger pointed upward, and said:\r\n\r\n“Weaugh!”\r\n\r\nThen she lifted her right hand, with the thumb pointed upward, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Teaugh!”\r\n\r\nThen she lifted both hands, with all the fingers and thumbs spread out,\r\nand cried:\r\n\r\n“Peaugh!”\r\n\r\nJack Pumpkinhead stepped back a pace, at this, and said in a\r\nreproachful voice:\r\n\r\n“Don’t yell like that! Do you think I’m deaf?”\r\n\r\nOld Mombi danced around him, frantic with delight.\r\n\r\n“He lives!” she screamed: “He lives! he lives!”\r\n\r\nThen she threw her stick into the air and caught it as it came down;\r\nand she hugged herself with both arms, and tried to do a step of a jig;\r\nand all the time she repeated, rapturously:\r\n\r\n“He lives!—he lives!—he lives!”\r\n\r\nNow you may well suppose that Tip observed all this with amazement.\r\n\r\nAt first he was so frightened and horrified that he wanted to run away,\r\nbut his legs trembled and shook so badly that he couldn’t. Then it\r\nstruck him as a very funny thing for Jack to come to life, especially\r\nas the expression on his pumpkin face was so droll and comical it\r\nexcited laughter on the instant. So, recovering from his first fear,\r\nTip began to laugh; and the merry peals reached old Mombi’s ears and\r\nmade her hobble quickly to the hedge, where she seized Tip’s collar and\r\ndragged him back to where she had left her basket and the pumpkinheaded\r\nman.\r\n\r\n“You naughty, sneaking, wicked boy!” she exclaimed, furiously: “I’ll\r\nteach you to spy out my secrets and to make fun of me!”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t making fun of you,” protested Tip. “I was laughing at old\r\nPumpkinhead! Look at him! Isn’t he a picture, though?”\r\n\r\n“I hope you are not reflecting on my personal appearance,” said Jack;\r\nand it was so funny to hear his grave voice, while his face continued\r\nto wear its jolly smile, that Tip again burst into a peal of laughter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image032]\r\n\r\nEven Mombi was not without a curious interest in the man her magic had\r\nbrought to life; for, after staring at him intently, she presently\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n“What do you know?”\r\n\r\n“Well, that is hard to tell,” replied Jack. “For although I feel that I\r\nknow a tremendous lot, I am not yet aware how much there is in the\r\nworld to find out about. It will take me a little time to discover\r\nwhether I am very wise or very foolish.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” said Mombi, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“But what are you going to do with him, now he is alive?” asked Tip,\r\nwondering.\r\n\r\n“I must think it over,” answered Mombi. “But we must get home at once,\r\nfor it is growing dark. Help the Pumpkinhead to walk.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind me,” said Jack; “I can walk as well as you can. Haven’t I\r\ngot legs and feet, and aren’t they jointed?”\r\n\r\n“Are they?” asked the woman, turning to Tip.\r\n\r\n“Of course they are; I made ’em myself,” returned the boy, with pride.\r\n\r\nSo they started for the house, but when they reached the farm yard old\r\nMombi led the pumpkin man to the cow stable and shut him up in an empty\r\nstall, fastening the door securely on the outside.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got to attend to you, first,” she said, nodding her head at Tip.\r\n\r\nHearing this, the boy became uneasy; for he knew Mombi had a bad and\r\nrevengeful heart, and would not hesitate to do any evil thing.\r\n\r\nThey entered the house. It was a round, domeshaped structure, as are\r\nnearly all the farm houses in the Land of Oz.\r\n\r\nMombi bade the boy light a candle, while she put her basket in a\r\ncupboard and hung her cloak on a peg. Tip obeyed quickly, for he was\r\nafraid of her.\r\n\r\nAfter the candle had been lighted Mombi ordered him to build a fire in\r\nthe hearth, and while Tip was thus engaged the old woman ate her\r\nsupper. When the flames began to crackle the boy came to her and asked\r\na share of the bread and cheese; but Mombi refused him.\r\n\r\n“I’m hungry!” said Tip, in a sulky tone.\r\n\r\n“You won’t be hungry long,” replied Mombi, with a grim look.\r\n\r\nThe boy didn’t like this speech, for it sounded like a threat; but he\r\nhappened to remember he had nuts in his pocket, so he cracked some of\r\nthose and ate them while the woman rose, shook the crumbs from her\r\napron, and hung above the fire a small black kettle.\r\n\r\nThen she measured out equal parts of milk and vinegar and poured them\r\ninto the kettle. Next she produced several packets of herbs and powders\r\nand began adding a portion of each to the contents of the kettle.\r\nOccasionally she would draw near the candle and read from a yellow\r\npaper the recipe of the mess she was concocting.\r\n\r\nAs Tip watched her his uneasiness increased.\r\n\r\n“What is that for?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“For you,” returned Mombi, briefly.\r\n\r\nTip wriggled around upon his stool and stared awhile at the kettle,\r\nwhich was beginning to bubble. Then he would glance at the stern and\r\nwrinkled features of the witch and wish he were any place but in that\r\ndim and smoky kitchen, where even the shadows cast by the candle upon\r\nthe wall were enough to give one the horrors. So an hour passed away,\r\nduring which the silence was only broken by the bubbling of the pot and\r\nthe hissing of the flames.\r\n\r\nFinally, Tip spoke again.\r\n\r\n“Have I got to drink that stuff?” he asked, nodding toward the pot.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mombi.\r\n\r\n“What’ll it do to me?” asked Tip.\r\n\r\n“If it’s properly made,” replied Mombi, “it will change or transform\r\nyou into a marble statue.”\r\n\r\nTip groaned, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead with his\r\nsleeve.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to be a marble statue!” he protested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image037]\r\n\r\n“That doesn’t matter I want you to be one,” said the old woman, looking\r\nat him severely.\r\n\r\n“What use’ll I be then?” asked Tip. “There won’t be any one to work for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll make the Pumpkinhead work for me,” said Mombi.\r\n\r\nAgain Tip groaned.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you change me into a goat, or a chicken?” he asked,\r\nanxiously. “You can’t do anything with a marble statue.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I can,” returned Mombi. “I’m going to plant a flower garden,\r\nnext Spring, and I’ll put you in the middle of it, for an ornament. I\r\nwonder I haven’t thought of that before; you’ve been a bother to me for\r\nyears.”\r\n\r\nAt this terrible speech Tip felt the beads of perspiration starting all\r\nover his body, but he sat still and shivered and looked anxiously at\r\nthe kettle.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it won’t work,” he mutttered, in a voice that sounded weak and\r\ndiscouraged.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I think it will,” answered Mombi, cheerfully. “I seldom make a\r\nmistake.”\r\n\r\nAgain there was a period of silence a silence so long and gloomy that\r\nwhen Mombi finally lifted the kettle from the fire it was close to\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\n“You cannot drink it until it has become quite cold,” announced the old\r\nwitch for in spite of the law she had acknowledged practising\r\nwitchcraft. “We must both go to bed now, and at daybreak I will call\r\nyou and at once complete your transformation into a marble statue.”\r\n\r\nWith this she hobbled into her room, bearing the steaming kettle with\r\nher, and Tip heard her close and lock the door.\r\n\r\nThe boy did not go to bed, as he had been commanded to do, but still\r\nsat glaring at the embers of the dying fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image038]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image039]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flight of the Fugitives\r\n\r\n\r\nTip reflected.\r\n\r\n“It’s a hard thing, to be a marble statue,” he thought, rebelliously,\r\n“and I’m not going to stand it. For years I’ve been a bother to her,\r\nshe says; so she’s going to get rid of me. Well, there’s an easier way\r\nthan to become a statue. No boy could have any fun forever standing in\r\nthe middle of a flower garden! I’ll run away, that’s what I’ll do—and I\r\nmay as well go before she makes me drink that nasty stuff in the\r\nkettle.” He waited until the snores of the old witch announced she was\r\nfast asleep, and then he arose softly and went to the cupboard to find\r\nsomething to eat.\r\n\r\n“No use starting on a journey without food,” he decided, searching upon\r\nthe narrow shelves.\r\n\r\nHe found some crusts of bread; but he had to look into Mombi’s basket\r\nto find the cheese she had brought from the village. While turning over\r\nthe contents of the basket he came upon the pepper-box which contained\r\nthe “Powder of Life.”\r\n\r\n“I may as well take this with me,” he thought, “or Mombi’ll be using it\r\nto make more mischief with.” So he put the box in his pocket, together\r\nwith the bread and cheese.\r\n\r\nThen he cautiously left the house and latched the door behind him.\r\nOutside both moon and stars shone brightly, and the night seemed\r\npeaceful and inviting after the close and ill-smelling kitchen.\r\n\r\n“I’ll be glad to get away,” said Tip, softly; “for I never did like\r\nthat old woman. I wonder how I ever came to live with her.”\r\n\r\nHe was walking slowly toward the road when a thought made him pause.\r\n\r\n“I don’t like to leave Jack Pumpkinhead to the tender mercies of old\r\nMombi,” he muttered. “And Jack belongs to me, for I made him even if\r\nthe old witch did bring him to life.”\r\n\r\nHe retraced his steps to the cow-stable and opened the door of the\r\nstall where the pumpkin-headed man had been left.\r\n\r\nJack was standing in the middle of the stall, and by the moonlight Tip\r\ncould see he was smiling just as jovially as ever.\r\n\r\n“Come on!” said the boy, beckoning.\r\n\r\n“Where to?” asked Jack.\r\n\r\n“You’ll know as soon as I do,” answered Tip, smiling sympathetically\r\ninto the pumpkin face.\r\n\r\n“All we’ve got to do now is to tramp.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” returned Jack, and walked awkwardly out of the stable and\r\ninto the moonlight.\r\n\r\nTip turned toward the road and the man followed him. Jack walked with a\r\nsort of limp, and occasionally one of the joints of his legs would turn\r\nbackward, instead of frontwise, almost causing him to tumble. But the\r\nPumpkinhead was quick to notice this, and began to take more pains to\r\nstep carefully; so that he met with few accidents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image041]\r\n\r\nTip led him along the path without stopping an instant. They could not\r\ngo very fast, but they walked steadily; and by the time the moon sank\r\naway and the sun peeped over the hills they had travelled so great a\r\ndistance that the boy had no reason to fear pursuit from the old witch.\r\nMoreover, he had turned first into one path, and then into another, so\r\nthat should anyone follow them it would prove very difficult to guess\r\nwhich way they had gone, or where to seek them.\r\n\r\nFairly satisfied that he had escaped—for a time, at least—being turned\r\ninto a marble statue, the boy stopped his companion and seated himself\r\nupon a rock by the roadside.\r\n\r\n“Let’s have some breakfast,” he said.\r\n\r\nJack Pumpkinhead watched Tip curiously, but refused to join in the\r\nrepast. “I don’t seem to be made the same way you are,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I know you are not,” returned Tip; “for I made you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Did you?” asked Jack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image043]\r\n\r\n“Certainly. And put you together. And carved your eyes and nose and\r\nears and mouth,” said Tip proudly. “And dressed you.”\r\n\r\nJack looked at his body and limbs critically.\r\n\r\n“It strikes me you made a very good job of it,” he remarked.\r\n\r\n“Just so-so,” replied Tip, modestly; for he began to see certain\r\ndefects in the construction of his man. “If I’d known we were going to\r\ntravel together I might have been a little more particular.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then,” said the Pumpkinhead, in a tone that expressed surprise,\r\n“you must be my creator my parent my father!”\r\n\r\n“Or your inventor,” replied the boy with a laugh. “Yes, my son; I\r\nreally believe I am!”\r\n\r\n“Then I owe you obedience,” continued the man, “and you owe\r\nme—support.”\r\n\r\n“That’s it, exactly”, declared Tip, jumping up. “So let us be off.”\r\n\r\n“Where are we going?” asked Jack, when they had resumed their journey.\r\n\r\n“I’m not exactly sure,” said the boy; “but I believe we are headed\r\nSouth, and that will bring us, sooner or later, to the Emerald City.”\r\n\r\n“What city is that?” enquired the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s the center of the Land of Oz, and the biggest town in all\r\nthe country. I’ve never been there, myself, but I’ve heard all about\r\nits history. It was built by a mighty and wonderful Wizard named Oz,\r\nand everything there is of a green color—just as everything in this\r\nCountry of the Gillikins is of a purple color.”\r\n\r\n“Is everything here purple?” asked Jack.\r\n\r\n“Of course it is. Can’t you see?” returned the boy.\r\n\r\n“I believe I must be color-blind,” said the Pumpkinhead, after staring\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n“Well, the grass is purple, and the trees are purple, and the houses\r\nand fences are purple,” explained Tip. “Even the mud in the roads is\r\npurple. But in the Emerald City everything is green that is purple\r\nhere. And in the Country of the Munchkins, over at the East, everything\r\nis blue; and in the South country of the Quadlings everything is red;\r\nand in the West country of the Winkies, where the Tin Woodman rules,\r\neverything is yellow.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Jack. Then, after a pause, he asked: “Did you say a Tin\r\nWoodman rules the Winkies?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; he was one of those who helped Dorothy to destroy the Wicked\r\nWitch of the West, and the Winkies were so grateful that they invited\r\nhim to become their ruler,—just as the people of the Emerald City\r\ninvited the Scarecrow to rule them.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me!” said Jack. “I’m getting confused with all this history. Who\r\nis the Scarecrow?”\r\n\r\n“Another friend of Dorothy’s,” replied Tip.\r\n\r\n“And who is Dorothy?”\r\n\r\n“She was a girl that came here from Kansas, a place in the big, outside\r\nWorld. She got blown to the Land of Oz by a cyclone, and while she was\r\nhere the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman accompanied her on her travels.”\r\n\r\n“And where is she now?” inquired the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n“Glinda the Good, who rules the Quadlings, sent her home again,” said\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\n“Oh. And what became of the Scarecrow?”\r\n\r\n“I told you. He rules the Emerald City,” answered Tip.\r\n\r\n“I thought you said it was ruled by a wonderful Wizard,” objected Jack,\r\nseeming more and more confused.\r\n\r\n“Well, so I did. Now, pay attention, and I’ll explain it,” said Tip,\r\nspeaking slowly and looking the smiling Pumpkinhead squarely in the\r\neye. “Dorothy went to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard to send her\r\nback to Kansas; and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman went with her.\r\nBut the Wizard couldn’t send her back, because he wasn’t so much of a\r\nWizard as he might have been. And then they got angry at the Wizard,\r\nand threatened to expose him; so the Wizard made a big balloon and\r\nescaped in it, and no one has ever seen him since.”\r\n\r\n“Now, that is very interesting history,” said Jack, well pleased; “and\r\nI understand it perfectly all but the explanation.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you do,” responded Tip. “After the Wizard was gone, the\r\npeople of the Emerald City made His Majesty, the Scarecrow, their King;\r\nand I have heard that he became a very popular ruler.”\r\n\r\n“Are we going to see this queer King?” asked Jack, with interest.\r\n\r\n“I think we may as well,” replied the boy; “unless you have something\r\nbetter to do.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, dear father,” said the Pumpkinhead. “I am quite willing to go\r\nwherever you please.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image047]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image048]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image049]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTip Makes an Experiment in Magic\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boy, small and rather delicate in appearance seemed somewhat\r\nembarrassed at being called “father” by the tall, awkward,\r\npumpkinheaded man, but to deny the relationship would involve another\r\nlong and tedious explanation; so he changed the subject by asking,\r\nabruptly:\r\n\r\n“Are you tired?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not!” replied the other. “But,” he continued, after a pause,\r\n“it is quite certain I shall wear out my wooden joints if I keep on\r\nwalking.”\r\n\r\nTip reflected, as they journeyed on, that this was true. He began to\r\nregret that he had not constructed the wooden limbs more carefully and\r\nsubstantially. Yet how could he ever have guessed that the man he had\r\nmade merely to scare old Mombi with would be brought to life by means\r\nof a magical powder contained in an old pepper-box?\r\n\r\nSo he ceased to reproach himself, and began to think how he might yet\r\nremedy the deficiencies of Jack’s weak joints.\r\n\r\nWhile thus engaged they came to the edge of a wood, and the boy sat\r\ndown to rest upon an old sawhorse that some woodcutter had left there.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you sit down?” he asked the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n“Won’t it strain my joints?” inquired the other.\r\n\r\n“Of course not. It’ll rest them,” declared the boy.\r\n\r\nSo Jack tried to sit down; but as soon as he bent his joints farther\r\nthan usual they gave way altogether, and he came clattering to the\r\nground with such a crash that Tip feared he was entirely ruined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image050]\r\n\r\nHe rushed to the man, lifted him to his feet, straightened his arms and\r\nlegs, and felt of his head to see if by chance it had become cracked.\r\nBut Jack seemed to be in pretty good shape, after all, and Tip said to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n“I guess you’d better remain standing, hereafter. It seems the safest\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, dear father.” just as you say, replied the smiling Jack,\r\nwho had been in no wise confused by his tumble.\r\n\r\nTip sat down again. Presently the Pumpkinhead asked:\r\n\r\n“What is that thing you are sitting on?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, this is a horse,” replied the boy, carelessly.\r\n\r\n“What is a horse?” demanded Jack.\r\n\r\n“A horse? Why, there are two kinds of horses,” returned Tip, slightly\r\npuzzled how to explain. “One kind of horse is alive, and has four legs\r\nand a head and a tail. And people ride upon its back.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said Jack, cheerfully “That’s the kind of horse you are\r\nnow sitting on.”\r\n\r\n“No, it isn’t,” answered Tip, promptly.\r\n\r\n“Why not? That one has four legs, and a head, and a tail.” Tip looked\r\nat the saw-horse more carefully, and found that the Pumpkinhead was\r\nright. The body had been formed from a tree-trunk, and a branch had\r\nbeen left sticking up at one end that looked very much like a tail. In\r\nthe other end were two big knots that resembled eyes, and a place had\r\nbeen chopped away that might easily be mistaken for the horse’s mouth.\r\nAs for the legs, they were four straight limbs cut from trees and stuck\r\nfast into the body, being spread wide apart so that the saw-horse would\r\nstand firmly when a log was laid across it to be sawed.\r\n\r\n“This thing resembles a real horse more than I imagined,” said Tip,\r\ntrying to explain. “But a real horse is alive, and trots and prances\r\nand eats oats, while this is nothing more than a dead horse, made of\r\nwood, and used to saw logs upon.”\r\n\r\n“If it were alive, wouldn’t it trot, and prance, and eat oats?”\r\ninquired the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n“It would trot and prance, perhaps; but it wouldn’t eat oats,” replied\r\nthe boy, laughing at the idea. “And of course it can’t ever be alive,\r\nbecause it is made of wood.”\r\n\r\n“So am I,” answered the man.\r\n\r\nTip looked at him in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Why, so you are!” he exclaimed. “And the magic powder that brought you\r\nto life is here in my pocket.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image053]\r\n\r\nHe brought out the pepper box, and eyed it curiously.\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” said he, musingly, “if it would bring the saw-horse to\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“If it would,” returned Jack, calmly for nothing seemed to surprise him\r\n“I could ride on its back, and that would save my joints from wearing\r\nout.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll try it!” cried the boy, jumping up. “But I wonder if I can\r\nremember the words old Mombi said, and the way she held her hands up.”\r\n\r\nHe thought it over for a minute, and as he had watched carefully from\r\nthe hedge every motion of the old witch, and listened to her words, he\r\nbelieved he could repeat exactly what she had said and done.\r\n\r\nSo he began by sprinkling some of the magic Powder of Life from the\r\npepper-box upon the body of the saw-horse. Then he lifted his left\r\nhand, with the little finger pointing upward, and said: “Weaugh!”\r\n\r\n“What does that mean, dear father?” asked Jack, curiously.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” answered Tip. Then he lifted his right hand, with the\r\nthumb pointing upward and said: “Teaugh!”\r\n\r\n“What’s that, dear father?” inquired Jack.\r\n\r\n“It means you must keep quiet!” replied the boy, provoked at being\r\ninterrupted at so important a moment.\r\n\r\n“How fast I am learning!” remarked the Pumpkinhead, with his eternal\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nTip now lifted both hands above his head, with all the fingers and\r\nthumbs spread out, and cried in a loud voice: “Peaugh!”\r\n\r\nImmediately the saw-horse moved, stretched its legs, yawned with its\r\nchopped-out mouth, and shook a few grains of the powder off its back.\r\nThe rest of the powder seemed to have vanished into the body of the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n“Good!” called Jack, while the boy looked on in astonishment. “You are\r\na very clever sorcerer, dear father!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image055]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image056]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image057]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Awakening of the Saw-horse\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse, finding himself alive, seemed even more astonished than\r\nTip. He rolled his knotty eyes from side to side, taking a first\r\nwondering view of the world in which he had now so important an\r\nexistence. Then he tried to look at himself; but he had, indeed, no\r\nneck to turn; so that in the endeavor to see his body he kept circling\r\naround and around, without catching even a glimpse of it. His legs were\r\nstiff and awkward, for there were no knee-joints in them; so that\r\npresently he bumped against Jack Pumpkinhead and sent that personage\r\ntumbling upon the moss that lined the roadside.\r\n\r\nTip became alarmed at this accident, as well as at the persistence of\r\nthe Saw-Horse in prancing around in a circle; so he called out:\r\n\r\n“Whoa! Whoa, there!”\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse paid no attention whatever to this command, and the next\r\ninstant brought one of his wooden legs down upon Tip’s foot so forcibly\r\nthat the boy danced away in pain to a safer distance, from where he\r\nagain yelled:\r\n\r\n“Whoa! Whoa, I say!”\r\n\r\nJack had now managed to raise himself to a sitting position, and he\r\nlooked at the Saw-Horse with much interest.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe the animal can hear you,” he remarked.\r\n\r\n“I shout loud enough, don’t I?” answered Tip, angrily.\r\n\r\n“Yes; but the horse has no ears,” said the smiling Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n“Sure enough!” exclaimed Tip, noting the fact for the first time. “How,\r\nthen, am I going to stop him?”\r\n\r\nBut at that instant the Saw-Horse stopped himself, having concluded it\r\nwas impossible to see his own body. He saw Tip, however, and came close\r\nto the boy to observe him more fully.\r\n\r\nIt was really comical to see the creature walk; for it moved the legs\r\non its right side together, and those on its left side together, as a\r\npacing horse does; and that made its body rock sidewise, like a cradle.\r\n\r\nTip patted it upon the head, and said “Good boy! Good Boy!” in a\r\ncoaxing tone; and the Saw-Horse pranced away to examine with its\r\nbulging eyes the form of Jack Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n“I must find a halter for him,” said Tip; and having made a search in\r\nhis pocket he produced a roll of strong cord. Unwinding this, he\r\napproached the Saw-Horse and tied the cord around its neck, afterward\r\nfastening the other end to a large tree. The Saw-Horse, not\r\nunderstanding the action, stepped backward and snapped the string\r\neasily; but it made no attempt to run away.\r\n\r\n“He’s stronger than I thought,” said the boy, “and rather obstinate,\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you make him some ears?” asked Jack. “Then you can tell him\r\nwhat to do.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a splendid idea!” said Tip. “How did you happen to think of\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I didn’t think of it,” answered the Pumpkinhead; “I didn’t need\r\nto, for it’s the simplest and easiest thing to do.”\r\n\r\nSo Tip got out his knife and fashioned some ears out of the bark of a\r\nsmall tree.\r\n\r\n“I mustn’t make them too big,” he said, as he whittled, “or our horse\r\nwould become a donkey.”\r\n\r\n“How is that?” inquired Jack, from the roadside.\r\n\r\n“Why, a horse has bigger ears than a man; and a donkey has bigger ears\r\nthan a horse,” explained Tip.\r\n\r\n“Then, if my ears were longer, would I be a horse?” asked Jack.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Tip, gravely, “you’ll never be anything but a\r\nPumpkinhead, no matter how big your ears are.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” returned Jack, nodding; “I think I understand.”\r\n\r\n“If you do, you’re a wonder,” remarked the boy “but there’s no harm in\r\n_thinking_ you understand. I guess these ears are ready now. Will you\r\nhold the horse while I stick them on?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, if you’ll help me up,” said Jack.\r\n\r\nSo Tip raised him to his feet, and the Pumpkinhead went to the horse\r\nand held its head while the boy bored two holes in it with his\r\nknife-blade and inserted the ears.\r\n\r\n“They make him look very handsome,” said Jack, admiringly.\r\n\r\nBut those words, spoken close to the Saw-Horse, and being the first\r\nsounds he had ever heard, so startled the animal that he made a bound\r\nforward and tumbled Tip on one side and Jack on the other. Then he\r\ncontinued to rush forward as if frightened by the clatter of his own\r\nfoot-steps.\r\n\r\n“Whoa!” shouted Tip, picking himself up; “whoa! you idiot whoa!” The\r\nSaw-Horse would probably have paid no attention to this, but just then\r\nit stepped a leg into a gopher-hole and stumbled head-over-heels to the\r\nground, where it lay upon its back, frantically waving its four legs in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nTip ran up to it.\r\n\r\n“You’re a nice sort of a horse, I must say!” he exclaimed. “Why didn’t\r\nyou stop when I yelled ‘whoa?’”\r\n\r\n“Does ‘whoa’ mean to stop?” asked the Saw-Horse, in a surprised voice,\r\nas it rolled its eyes upward to look at the boy.\r\n\r\n“Of course it does,” answered Tip.\r\n\r\n“And a hole in the ground means to stop, also, doesn’t it?” continued\r\nthe horse.\r\n\r\n“To be sure; unless you step over it,” said Tip.\r\n\r\n“What a strange place this is,” the creature exclaimed, as if amazed.\r\n“What am I doing here, anyway?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I’ve brought you to life,” answered the boy “but it won’t hurt\r\nyou any, if you mind me and do as I tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will do as you tell me,” replied the Saw-Horse, humbly. “But\r\nwhat happened to me, a moment ago? I don’t seem to be just right,\r\nsomeway.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image062]\r\n\r\n“You’re upside down,” explained Tip. “But just keep those legs still a\r\nminute and I’ll set you right side up again.”\r\n\r\n“How many sides have I?” asked the creature, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n“Several,” said Tip, briefly. “But do keep those legs still.”\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse now became quiet, and held its legs rigid; so that Tip,\r\nafter several efforts, was able to roll him over and set him upright.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I seem all right now,” said the queer animal, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“One of your ears is broken,” Tip announced, after a careful\r\nexamination. “I’ll have to make a new one.”\r\n\r\nThen he led the Saw-Horse back to where Jack was vainly struggling to\r\nregain his feet, and after assisting the Pumpkinhead to stand upright\r\nTip whittled out a new ear and fastened it to the horse’s head.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said he, addressing his steed, “pay attention to what I’m going\r\nto tell you. ‘Whoa!’ means to stop; ‘Get-Up!’ means to walk forward;\r\n‘Trot!’ means to go as fast as you can. Understand?”\r\n\r\n“I believe I do,” returned the horse.\r\n\r\n“Very good. We are all going on a journey to the Emerald City, to see\r\nHis Majesty, the Scarecrow; and Jack Pumpkinhead is going to ride on\r\nyour back, so he won’t wear out his joints.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind,” said the Saw-Horse. “Anything that suits you suits me.”\r\n\r\nThen Tip assisted Jack to get upon the horse.\r\n\r\n“Hold on tight,” he cautioned, “or you may fall off and crack your\r\npumpkin head.”\r\n\r\n“That would be horrible!” said Jack, with a shudder. “What shall I hold\r\non to?”\r\n\r\n“Why, hold on to his ears,” replied Tip, after a moment’s hesitation.\r\n\r\n“Don’t do that!” remonstrated the Saw-Horse; “for then I can’t hear.”\r\n\r\nThat seemed reasonable, so Tip tried to think of something else.\r\n\r\n“I’ll fix it!” said he, at length. He went into the wood and cut a\r\nshort length of limb from a young, stout tree. One end of this he\r\nsharpened to a point, and then he dug a hole in the back of the\r\nSaw-Horse, just behind its head. Next he brought a piece of rock from\r\nthe road and hammered the post firmly into the animal’s back.\r\n\r\n“Stop! Stop!” shouted the horse; “you’re jarring me terribly.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image065]\r\n\r\n“Does it hurt?” asked the boy.\r\n\r\n“Not exactly hurt,” answered the animal; “but it makes me quite nervous\r\nto be jarred.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s all over now” said Tip, encouragingly. “Now, Jack, be sure\r\nto hold fast to this post and then you can’t fall off and get smashed.”\r\n\r\nSo Jack held on tight, and Tip said to the horse:\r\n\r\n“Get up.”\r\n\r\nThe obedient creature at once walked forward, rocking from side to side\r\nas he raised his feet from the ground.\r\n\r\nTip walked beside the Saw-Horse, quite content with this addition to\r\ntheir party. Presently he began to whistle.\r\n\r\n“What does that sound mean?” asked the horse.\r\n\r\n“Don’t pay any attention to it,” said Tip. “I’m just whistling, and\r\nthat only means I’m pretty well satisfied.”\r\n\r\n“I’d whistle myself, if I could push my lips together,” remarked Jack.\r\n“I fear, dear father, that in some respects I am sadly lacking.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image067]\r\n\r\nAfter journeying on for some distance the narrow path they were\r\nfollowing turned into a broad roadway, paved with yellow brick. By the\r\nside of the road Tip noticed a sign-post that read:\r\n\r\n“NINE MILES TO THE EMERALD CITY.”\r\n\r\nBut it was now growing dark, so he decided to camp for the night by the\r\nroadside and to resume the journey next morning by daybreak. He led the\r\nSaw-Horse to a grassy mound upon which grew several bushy trees, and\r\ncarefully assisted the Pumpkinhead to alight.\r\n\r\n“I think I’ll lay you upon the ground, overnight,” said the boy. “You\r\nwill be safer that way.”\r\n\r\n“How about me?” asked the Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n“It won’t hurt you to stand,” replied Tip; “and, as you can’t sleep,\r\nyou may as well watch out and see that no one comes near to disturb\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nThen the boy stretched himself upon the grass beside the Pumpkinhead,\r\nand being greatly wearied by the journey was soon fast asleep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image069]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image070]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image071]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJack Pumpkinhead’s Ride to the Emerald City\r\n\r\n\r\nAt daybreak Tip was awakened by the Pumpkinhead. He rubbed the sleep\r\nfrom his eyes, bathed in a little brook, and then ate a portion of his\r\nbread and cheese. Having thus prepared for a new day the boy said:\r\n\r\n“Let us start at once. Nine miles is quite a distance, but we ought to\r\nreach the Emerald City by noon if no accidents happen.” So the\r\nPumpkinhead was again perched upon the back of the Saw-Horse and the\r\njourney was resumed.\r\n\r\nTip noticed that the purple tint of the grass and trees had now faded\r\nto a dull lavender, and before long this lavender appeared to take on a\r\ngreenish tinge that gradually brightened as they drew nearer to the\r\ngreat City where the Scarecrow ruled.\r\n\r\nThe little party had traveled but a short two miles upon their way when\r\nthe road of yellow brick was parted by a broad and swift river. Tip was\r\npuzzled how to cross over; but after a time he discovered a man in a\r\nferry-boat approaching from the other side of the stream.\r\n\r\nWhen the man reached the bank Tip asked:\r\n\r\n“Will you row us to the other side?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if you have money,” returned the ferryman, whose face looked\r\ncross and disagreeable.\r\n\r\n“But I have no money,” said Tip.\r\n\r\n“None at all?” inquired the man.\r\n\r\n“None at all,” answered the boy.\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll not break my back rowing you over,” said the ferryman,\r\ndecidedly.\r\n\r\n“What a nice man!” remarked the Pumpkinhead, smilingly.\r\n\r\nThe ferryman stared at him, but made no reply. Tip was trying to think,\r\nfor it was a great disappointment to him to find his journey so\r\nsuddenly brought to an end.\r\n\r\n“I must certainly get to the Emerald City,” he said to the boatman;\r\n“but how can I cross the river if you do not take me?”\r\n\r\nThe man laughed, and it was not a nice laugh.\r\n\r\n“That wooden horse will float,” said he; “and you can ride him across.\r\nAs for the pumpkinheaded loon who accompanies you, let him sink or swim\r\nit won’t matter greatly which.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image073]\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry about me,” said Jack, smiling pleasantly upon the crabbed\r\nferryman; “I’m sure I ought to float beautifully.”\r\n\r\nTip thought the experiment was worth making, and the Saw-Horse, who did\r\nnot know what danger meant, offered no objections whatever. So the boy\r\nled it down into the water and climbed upon its back. Jack also waded\r\nin up to his knees and grasped the tail of the horse so that he might\r\nkeep his pumpkin head above the water.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Tip, instructing the Saw-Horse, “if you wiggle your legs\r\nyou will probably swim; and if you swim we shall probably reach the\r\nother side.”\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse at once began to wiggle its legs, which acted as oars and\r\nmoved the adventurers slowly across the river to the opposite side. So\r\nsuccessful was the trip that presently they were climbing, wet and\r\ndripping, up the grassy bank.\r\n\r\nTip’s trouser-legs and shoes were thoroughly soaked; but the Saw-Horse\r\nhad floated so perfectly that from his knees up the boy was entirely\r\ndry. As for the Pumpkinhead, every stitch of his gorgeous clothing\r\ndripped water.\r\n\r\n“The sun will soon dry us,” said Tip “and, anyhow, we are now safely\r\nacross, in spite of the ferryman, and can continue our journey.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mind swimming, at all,” remarked the horse.\r\n\r\n“Nor did I,” added Jack.\r\n\r\nThey soon regained the road of yellow brick, which proved to be a\r\ncontinuation of the road they had left on the other side, and then Tip\r\nonce more mounted the Pumpkinhead upon the back of the Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n“If you ride fast,” said he, “the wind will help to dry your clothing.\r\nI will hold on to the horse’s tail and run after you. In this way we\r\nall will become dry in a very short time.”\r\n\r\n“Then the horse must step lively,” said Jack.\r\n\r\n“I’ll do my best,” returned the Saw-Horse, cheerfully.\r\n\r\nTip grasped the end of the branch that served as tail to the Saw-Horse,\r\nand called loudly: “Get-up!”\r\n\r\nThe horse started at a good pace, and Tip followed behind. Then he\r\ndecided they could go faster, so he shouted: “Trot!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image075]\r\n\r\nNow, the Saw-Horse remembered that this word was the command to go as\r\nfast as he could; so he began rocking along the road at a tremendous\r\npace, and Tip had hard work—running faster than he ever had before in\r\nhis life—to keep his feet.\r\n\r\nSoon he was out of breath, and although he wanted to call “Whoa!” to\r\nthe horse, he found he could not get the word out of his throat. Then\r\nthe end of the tail he was clutching, being nothing more than a dead\r\nbranch, suddenly broke away, and the next minute the boy was rolling in\r\nthe dust of the road, while the horse and its pumpkin-headed rider\r\ndashed on and quickly disappeared in the distance.\r\n\r\nBy the time Tip had picked himself up and cleared the dust from his\r\nthroat so he could say “Whoa!” there was no further need of saying it,\r\nfor the horse was long since out of sight.\r\n\r\nSo he did the only sensible thing he could do. He sat down and took a\r\ngood rest, and afterward began walking along the road.\r\n\r\n“Some time I will surely overtake them,” he reflected; “for the road\r\nwill end at the gates of the Emerald City, and they can go no further\r\nthan that.”\r\n\r\nMeantime Jack was holding fast to the post and the Saw-Horse was\r\ntearing along the road like a racer. Neither of them knew Tip was left\r\nbehind, for the Pumpkinhead did not look around and the Saw-Horse\r\ncouldn’t.\r\n\r\nAs he rode, Jack noticed that the grass and trees had become a bright\r\nemerald-green in color, so he guessed they were nearing the Emerald\r\nCity even before the tall spires and domes came into sight.\r\n\r\nAt length a high wall of green stone, studded thick with emeralds,\r\nloomed up before them; and fearing the Saw-Horse would not know enough\r\nto stop and so might smash them both against this wall, Jack ventured\r\nto cry “Whoa!” as loud as he could.\r\n\r\nSo suddenly did the horse obey that had it not been for his post Jack\r\nwould have been pitched off head foremost, and his beautiful face\r\nruined.\r\n\r\n“That was a fast ride, dear father!” he exclaimed; and then, hearing no\r\nreply, he turned around and discovered for the first time that Tip was\r\nnot there.\r\n\r\nThis apparent desertion puzzled the Pumpkinhead, and made him uneasy.\r\nAnd while he was wondering what had become of the boy, and what he\r\nought to do next under such trying circumstances, the gateway in the\r\ngreen wall opened and a man came out.\r\n\r\nThis man was short and round, with a fat face that seemed remarkably\r\ngood-natured. He was clothed all in green and wore a high, peaked green\r\nhat upon his head and green spectacles over his eyes. Bowing before the\r\nPumpkinhead he said:\r\n\r\n“I am the Guardian of the Gates of the Emerald City. May I inquire who\r\nyou are, and what is your business?”\r\n\r\n“My name is Jack Pumpkinhead,” returned the other, smilingly; “but as\r\nto my business, I haven’t the least idea in the world what it is.”\r\n\r\nThe Guardian of the Gates looked surprised, and shook his head as if\r\ndissatisfied with the reply.\r\n\r\n“What are you, a man or a pumpkin?” he asked, politely.\r\n\r\n“Both, if you please,” answered Jack.\r\n\r\n“And this wooden horse—is it alive?” questioned the Guardian.\r\n\r\nThe horse rolled one knotty eye upward and winked at Jack. Then it gave\r\na prance and brought one leg down on the Guardian’s toes.\r\n\r\n“Ouch!” cried the man; “I’m sorry I asked that question. But the answer\r\nis most convincing. Have you any errand, sir, in the Emerald City?”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me that I have,” replied the Pumpkinhead, seriously; “but\r\nI cannot think what it is. My father knows all about it, but he is not\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“This is a strange affair very strange!” declared the Guardian. “But\r\nyou seem harmless. Folks do not smile so delightfully when they mean\r\nmischief.”\r\n\r\n“As for that,” said Jack, “I cannot help my smile, for it is carved on\r\nmy face with a jack-knife.”\r\n\r\n“Well, come with me into my room,” resumed the Guardian, “and I will\r\nsee what can be done for you.”\r\n\r\nSo Jack rode the Saw-Horse through the gateway into a little room built\r\ninto the wall. The Guardian pulled a bell-cord, and presently a very\r\ntall soldier—clothed in a green uniform—entered from the opposite door.\r\nThis soldier carried a long green gun over his shoulder and had lovely\r\ngreen whiskers that fell quite to his knees. The Guardian at once\r\naddressed him, saying:\r\n\r\n“Here is a strange gentleman who doesn’t know why he has come to the\r\nEmerald City, or what he wants. Tell me, what shall we do with him?”\r\n\r\nThe Soldier with the Green Whiskers looked at Jack with much care and\r\ncuriosity. Finally he shook his head so positively that little waves\r\nrippled down his whiskers, and then he said:\r\n\r\n“I must take him to His Majesty, the Scarecrow.”\r\n\r\n“But what will His Majesty, the Scarecrow, do with him?” asked the\r\nGuardian of the Gates.\r\n\r\n“That is His Majesty’s business,” returned the soldier. “I have\r\ntroubles enough of my own. All outside troubles must be turned over to\r\nHis Majesty. So put the spectacles on this fellow, and I’ll take him to\r\nthe royal palace.”\r\n\r\nSo the Guardian opened a big box of spectacles and tried to fit a pair\r\nto Jack’s great round eyes.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t a pair in stock that will really cover those eyes up,” said\r\nthe little man, with a sigh; “and your head is so big that I shall be\r\nobliged to tie the spectacles on.”\r\n\r\n“But why need I wear spectacles?” asked Jack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image081]\r\n\r\n“It’s the fashion here,” said the Soldier, “and they will keep you from\r\nbeing blinded by the glitter and glare of the gorgeous Emerald City.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” exclaimed Jack. “Tie them on, by all means. I don’t wish to be\r\nblinded.”\r\n\r\n“Nor I!” broke in the Saw-Horse; so a pair of green spectacles was\r\nquickly fastened over the bulging knots that served it for eyes.\r\n\r\nThen the Soldier with the Green Whiskers led them through the inner\r\ngate and they at once found themselves in the main street of the\r\nmagnificent Emerald City.\r\n\r\nSparkling green gems ornamented the fronts of the beautiful houses and\r\nthe towers and turrets were all faced with emeralds. Even the green\r\nmarble pavement glittered with precious stones, and it was indeed a\r\ngrand and marvelous sight to one who beheld it for the first time.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Pumpkinhead and the Saw-Horse, knowing nothing of wealth\r\nand beauty, paid little attention to the wonderful sights they saw\r\nthrough their green spectacles. They calmly followed after the green\r\nsoldier and scarcely noticed the crowds of green people who stared at\r\nthem in surprise. When a green dog ran out and barked at them the\r\nSaw-Horse promptly kicked at it with its wooden leg and sent the little\r\nanimal howling into one of the houses; but nothing more serious than\r\nthis happened to interrupt their progress to the royal palace.\r\n\r\nThe Pumpkinhead wanted to ride up the green marble steps and straight\r\ninto the Scarecrow’s presence; but the soldier would not permit that.\r\nSo Jack dismounted, with much difficulty, and a servant led the\r\nSaw-Horse around to the rear while the Soldier with the Green Whiskers\r\nescorted the Pumpkinhead into the palace, by the front entrance.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was left in a handsomely furnished waiting room while the\r\nsoldier went to announce him. It so happened that at this hour His\r\nMajesty was at leisure and greatly bored for want of something to do,\r\nso he ordered his visitor to be shown at once into his throne room.\r\n\r\nJack felt no fear or embarrassment at meeting the ruler of this\r\nmagnificent city, for he was entirely ignorant of all worldly customs.\r\nBut when he entered the room and saw for the first time His Majesty the\r\nScarecrow seated upon his glittering throne, he stopped short in\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image084]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image085]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the Scarecrow\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose every reader of this book knows what a scarecrow is; but Jack\r\nPumpkinhead, never having seen such a creation, was more surprised at\r\nmeeting the remarkable King of the Emerald City than by any other one\r\nexperience of his brief life.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty the Scarecrow was dressed in a suit of faded blue clothes,\r\nand his head was merely a small sack stuffed with straw, upon which\r\neyes, ears, a nose and a mouth had been rudely painted to represent a\r\nface. The clothes were also stuffed with straw, and that so unevenly or\r\ncarelessly that his Majesty’s legs and arms seemed more bumpy than was\r\nnecessary. Upon his hands were gloves with long fingers, and these were\r\npadded with cotton. Wisps of straw stuck out from the monarch’s coat\r\nand also from his neck and boot-tops. Upon his head he wore a heavy\r\ngolden crown set thick with sparkling jewels, and the weight of this\r\ncrown caused his brow to sag in wrinkles, giving a thoughtful\r\nexpression to the painted face. Indeed, the crown alone betokened\r\nmajesty; in all else the, Scarecrow King was but a simple\r\nscarecrow—flimsy, awkward, and unsubstantial.\r\n\r\nBut if the strange appearance of his Majesty the Scarecrow seemed\r\nstartling to Jack, no less wonderful was the form of the Pumpkinhead to\r\nthe Scarecrow. The purple trousers and pink waistcoat and red shirt\r\nhung loosely over the wooden joints Tip had manufactured, and the\r\ncarved face on the pumpkin grinned perpetually, as if its wearer\r\nconsidered life the jolliest thing imaginable.\r\n\r\nAt first, indeed, His Majesty thought his queer visitor was laughing at\r\nhim, and was inclined to resent such a liberty; but it was not without\r\nreason that the Scarecrow had attained the reputation of being the\r\nwisest personage in the Land of Oz. He made a more careful examination\r\nof his visitor, and soon discovered that Jack’s features were carved\r\ninto a smile and that he could not look grave if he wished to.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image087]\r\n\r\nThe King was the first to speak. After regarding Jack for some minutes\r\nhe said, in a tone of wonder:\r\n\r\n“Where on earth did you come from, and how do you happen to be alive?”\r\n\r\n“I beg your Majesty’s pardon,” returned the Pumpkinhead; “but I do not\r\nunderstand you.”\r\n\r\n“What don’t you understand?” asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“Why, I don’t understand your language. You see, I came from the\r\nCountry of the Gillikins, so that I am a foreigner.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, to be sure!” exclaimed the Scarecrow. “I myself speak the language\r\nof the Munchkins, which is also the language of the Emerald City. But\r\nyou, I suppose, speak the language of the Pumpkinheads?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so, your Majesty” replied the other, bowing; “so it will be\r\nimpossible for us to understand one another.”\r\n\r\n“That is unfortunate, certainly,” said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully. “We\r\nmust have an interpreter.”\r\n\r\n“What is an interpreter?” asked Jack.\r\n\r\n“A person who understands both my language and your own. When I say\r\nanything, the interpreter can tell you what I mean; and when you say\r\nanything the interpreter can tell me what _you_ mean. For the\r\ninterpreter can speak both languages as well as understand them.”\r\n\r\n“That is certainly clever,” said Jack, greatly pleased at finding so\r\nsimple a way out of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nSo the Scarecrow commanded the Soldier with the Green Whiskers to\r\nsearch among his people until he found one who understood the language\r\nof the Gillikins as well as the language of the Emerald City, and to\r\nbring that person to him at once.\r\n\r\nWhen the Soldier had departed the Scarecrow said:\r\n\r\n“Won’t you take a chair while we are waiting?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image090]\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty forgets that I cannot understand you,” replied the\r\nPumpkinhead. “If you wish me to sit down you must make a sign for me to\r\ndo so.” The Scarecrow came down from his throne and rolled an armchair\r\nto a position behind the Pumpkinhead. Then he gave Jack a sudden push\r\nthat sent him sprawling upon the cushions in so awkward a fashion that\r\nhe doubled up like a jackknife, and had hard work to untangle himself.\r\n\r\n“Did you understand that sign?” asked His Majesty, politely.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly,” declared Jack, reaching up his arms to turn his head to\r\nthe front, the pumpkin having twisted around upon the stick that\r\nsupported it.\r\n\r\n“You seem hastily made,” remarked the Scarecrow, watching Jack’s\r\nefforts to straighten himself.\r\n\r\n“Not more so than your Majesty,” was the frank reply.\r\n\r\n“There is this difference between us,” said the Scarecrow, “that\r\nwhereas I will bend, but not break, you will break, but not bend.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the soldier returned leading a young girl by the hand.\r\nShe seemed very sweet and modest, having a pretty face and beautiful\r\ngreen eyes and hair. A dainty green silk skirt reached to her knees,\r\nshowing silk stockings embroidered with pea-pods, and green satin\r\nslippers with bunches of lettuce for decorations instead of bows or\r\nbuckles. Upon her silken waist clover leaves were embroidered, and she\r\nwore a jaunty little jacket trimmed with sparkling emeralds of a\r\nuniform size.\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s little Jellia Jamb!” exclaimed the Scarecrow, as the green\r\nmaiden bowed her pretty head before him. “Do you understand the\r\nlanguage of the Gillikins, my dear?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your Majesty,” she answered, “for I was born in the North\r\nCountry.”\r\n\r\n“Then you shall be our interpreter,” said the Scarecrow, “and explain\r\nto this Pumpkinhead all that I say, and also explain to me all that\r\n_he_ says. Is this arrangement satisfactory?” he asked, turning toward\r\nhis guest.\r\n\r\n“Very satisfactory indeed,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Then ask him, to begin with,” resumed the Scarecrow, turning to\r\nJellia, “what brought him to the Emerald City”\r\n\r\nBut instead of this the girl, who had been staring at Jack, said to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n“You are certainly a wonderful creature. Who made you?”\r\n\r\n“A boy named Tip,” answered Jack.\r\n\r\n“What does he say?” inquired the Scarecrow. “My ears must have deceived\r\nme. What did he say?”\r\n\r\n“He says that your Majesty’s brains seem to have come loose,” replied\r\nthe girl, demurely.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow moved uneasily upon his throne, and felt of his head with\r\nhis left hand.\r\n\r\n“What a fine thing it is to understand two different languages,” he\r\nsaid, with a perplexed sigh. “Ask him, my dear, if he has any objection\r\nto being put in jail for insulting the ruler of the Emerald City.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t insult you!” protested Jack, indignantly.\r\n\r\n“Tut—tut!” cautioned the Scarecrow “wait, until Jellia translates my\r\nspeech. What have we got an interpreter for, if you break out in this\r\nrash way?”\r\n\r\n“All right, I’ll wait,” replied the Pumpkinhead, in a surly\r\ntone—although his face smiled as genially as ever. “Translate the\r\nspeech, young woman.”\r\n\r\n“His Majesty inquires if you are hungry,” said Jellia.\r\n\r\n“Oh, not at all!” answered Jack, more pleasantly, “for it is impossible\r\nfor me to eat.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the same way with me,” remarked the Scarecrow. “What did he say,\r\nJellia, my dear?”\r\n\r\n“He asked if you were aware that one of your eyes is painted larger\r\nthan the other,” said the girl, mischievously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image093]\r\n\r\n“Don’t you believe her, your Majesty,” cried Jack.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t,” answered the Scarecrow, calmly. Then, casting a sharp\r\nlook at the girl, he asked:\r\n\r\n“Are you quite certain you understand the languages of both the\r\nGillikins and the Munchkins?”\r\n\r\n“Quite certain, your Majesty,” said Jellia Jamb, trying hard not to\r\nlaugh in the face of royalty.\r\n\r\n“Then how is it that I seem to understand them myself?” inquired the\r\nScarecrow.\r\n\r\n“Because they are one and the same!” declared the girl, now laughing\r\nmerrily. “Does not your Majesty know that in all the land of Oz but one\r\nlanguage is spoken?”\r\n\r\n“Is it indeed so?” cried the Scarecrow, much relieved to hear this;\r\n“then I might easily have been my own interpreter!”\r\n\r\n“It was all my fault, your Majesty,” said Jack, looking rather foolish,\r\n“I thought we must surely speak different languages, since we came from\r\ndifferent countries.”\r\n\r\n“This should be a warning to you never to think,” returned the\r\nScarecrow, severely. “For unless one can think wisely it is better to\r\nremain a dummy—which you most certainly are.”\r\n\r\n“I am!—I surely am!” agreed the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” continued the Scarecrow, more mildly, “that your\r\nmanufacturer spoiled some good pies to create an indifferent man.”\r\n\r\n“I assure your Majesty that I did not ask to be created,” answered\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n“Ah! It was the same in my case,” said the King, pleasantly. “And so,\r\nas we differ from all ordinary people, let us become friends.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart!” exclaimed Jack.\r\n\r\n“What! Have you a heart?” asked the Scarecrow, surprised.\r\n\r\n“No; that was only imaginative—I might say, a figure of speech,” said\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n“Well, your most prominent figure seems to be a figure of wood; so I\r\nmust beg you to restrain an imagination which, having no brains, you\r\nhave no right to exercise,” suggested the Scarecrow, warningly.\r\n\r\n“To be sure!” said Jack, without in the least comprehending.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty then dismissed Jellia Jamb and the Soldier with the Green\r\nWhiskers, and when they were gone he took his new friend by the arm and\r\nled him into the courtyard to play a game of quoits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image097]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image098]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image099]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGen. Jinjur’s Army of Revolt\r\n\r\n\r\nTip was so anxious to rejoin his man Jack and the Saw-Horse that he\r\nwalked a full half the distance to the Emerald City without stopping to\r\nrest. Then he discovered that he was hungry and the crackers and cheese\r\nhe had provided for the Journey had all been eaten.\r\n\r\nWhile wondering what he should do in this emergency he came upon a girl\r\nsitting by the roadside. She wore a costume that struck the boy as\r\nbeing remarkably brilliant: her silken waist being of emerald green and\r\nher skirt of four distinct colors—blue in front, yellow at the left\r\nside, red at the back and purple at the right side. Fastening the waist\r\nin front were four buttons—the top one blue, the next yellow, a third\r\nred and the last purple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image100]\r\n\r\nThe splendor of this dress was almost barbaric; so Tip was fully\r\njustified in staring at the gown for some moments before his eyes were\r\nattracted by the pretty face above it. Yes, the face was pretty enough,\r\nhe decided; but it wore an expression of discontent coupled to a shade\r\nof defiance or audacity.\r\n\r\nWhile the boy stared the girl looked upon him calmly. A lunch basket\r\nstood beside her, and she held a dainty sandwich in one hand and a\r\nhard-boiled egg in the other, eating with an evident appetite that\r\naroused Tip’s sympathy.\r\n\r\nHe was just about to ask a share of the luncheon when the girl stood up\r\nand brushed the crumbs from her lap.\r\n\r\n“There!” said she; “it is time for me to go. Carry that basket for me\r\nand help yourself to its contents if you are hungry.”\r\n\r\nTip seized the basket eagerly and began to eat, following for a time\r\nthe strange girl without bothering to ask questions. She walked along\r\nbefore him with swift strides, and there was about her an air of\r\ndecision and importance that led him to suspect she was some great\r\npersonage.\r\n\r\nFinally, when he had satisfied his hunger, he ran up beside her and\r\ntried to keep pace with her swift footsteps—a very difficult feat, for\r\nshe was much taller than he, and evidently in a hurry.\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much for the sandwiches,” said Tip, as he trotted\r\nalong. “May I ask your name?”\r\n\r\n“I am General Jinjur,” was the brief reply.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said the boy surprised. “What sort of a General?”\r\n\r\n“I command the Army of Revolt in this war,” answered the General, with\r\nunnecessary sharpness.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” he again exclaimed. “I didn’t know there was a war.”\r\n\r\n“You were not supposed to know it,” she returned, “for we have kept it\r\na secret; and considering that our army is composed entirely of girls,”\r\nshe added, with some pride, “it is surely a remarkable thing that our\r\nRevolt is not yet discovered.”\r\n\r\n“It is, indeed,” acknowledged Tip. “But where is your army?”\r\n\r\n“About a mile from here,” said General Jinjur. “The forces have\r\nassembled from all parts of the Land of Oz, at my express command. For\r\nthis is the day we are to conquer His Majesty the Scarecrow, and wrest\r\nfrom him the throne. The Army of Revolt only awaits my coming to march\r\nupon the Emerald City.”\r\n\r\n“Well!” declared Tip, drawing a long breath, “this is certainly a\r\nsurprising thing! May I ask why you wish to conquer His Majesty the\r\nScarecrow?”\r\n\r\n“Because the Emerald City has been ruled by men long enough, for one\r\nreason,” said the girl.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, the City glitters with beautiful gems, which might far\r\nbetter be used for rings, bracelets and necklaces; and there is enough\r\nmoney in the King’s treasury to buy every girl in our Army a dozen new\r\ngowns. So we intend to conquer the City and run the government to suit\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\nJinjur spoke these words with an eagerness and decision that proved she\r\nwas in earnest.\r\n\r\n“But war is a terrible thing,” said Tip, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“This war will be pleasant,” replied the girl, cheerfully.\r\n\r\n“Many of you will be slain!” continued the boy, in an awed voice.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no”, said Jinjur. “What man would oppose a girl, or dare to harm\r\nher? And there is not an ugly face in my entire Army.”\r\n\r\nTip laughed.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right,” said he. “But the Guardian of the Gate is\r\nconsidered a faithful Guardian, and the King’s Army will not let the\r\nCity be conquered without a struggle.”\r\n\r\n“The Army is old and feeble,” replied General Jinjur, scornfully. “His\r\nstrength has all been used to grow whiskers, and his wife has such a\r\ntemper that she has already pulled more than half of them out by the\r\nroots. When the Wonderful Wizard reigned the Soldier with the Green\r\nWhiskers was a very good Royal Army, for people feared the Wizard. But\r\nno one is afraid of the Scarecrow, so his Royal Army don’t count for\r\nmuch in time of war.”\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation they proceeded some distance in silence, and\r\nbefore long reached a large clearing in the forest where fully four\r\nhundred young women were assembled. These were laughing and talking\r\ntogether as gaily as if they had gathered for a picnic instead of a war\r\nof conquest.\r\n\r\nThey were divided into four companies, and Tip noticed that all were\r\ndressed in costumes similar to that worn by General Jinjur. The only\r\nreal difference was that while those girls from the Munchkin country\r\nhad the blue strip in front of their skirts, those from the country of\r\nthe Quadlings had the red strip in front; and those from the country of\r\nthe Winkies had the yellow strip in front, and the Gillikin girls wore\r\nthe purple strip in front. All had green waists, representing the\r\nEmerald City they intended to conquer, and the top button on each waist\r\nindicated by its color which country the wearer came from. The uniforms\r\nwere Jaunty and becoming, and quite effective when massed together.\r\n\r\nTip thought this strange Army bore no weapons whatever; but in this he\r\nwas wrong. For each girl had stuck through the knot of her back hair\r\ntwo long, glittering knitting-needles.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jinjur immediately mounted the stump of a tree and addressed\r\nher army.\r\n\r\n“Friends, fellow-citizens, and girls!” she said; “we are about to begin\r\nour great Revolt against the men of Oz! We march to conquer the Emerald\r\nCity—to dethrone the Scarecrow King—to acquire thousands of gorgeous\r\ngems—to rifle the royal treasury—and to obtain power over our former\r\noppressors!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image105]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image106]\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” said those who had listened; but Tip thought most of the Army\r\nwas too much engaged in chattering to pay attention to the words of the\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\nThe command to march was now given, and the girls formed themselves\r\ninto four bands, or companies, and set off with eager strides toward\r\nthe Emerald City.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image107]\r\n\r\nThe boy followed after them, carrying several baskets and wraps and\r\npackages which various members of the Army of Revolt had placed in his\r\ncare. It was not long before they came to the green granite walls of\r\nthe City and halted before the gateway.\r\n\r\nThe Guardian of the Gate at once came out and looked at them curiously,\r\nas if a circus had come to town. He carried a bunch of keys swung round\r\nhis neck by a golden chain; his hands were thrust carelessly into his\r\npockets, and he seemed to have no idea at all that the City was\r\nthreatened by rebels. Speaking pleasantly to the girls, he said:\r\n\r\n“Good morning, my dears! What can I do for you?”\r\n\r\n“Surrender instantly!” answered General Jinjur, standing before him and\r\nfrowning as terribly as her pretty face would allow her to.\r\n\r\n“Surrender!” echoed the man, astounded. “Why, it’s impossible. It’s\r\nagainst the law! I never heard of such a thing in my life.”\r\n\r\n“Still, you must surrender!” exclaimed the General, fiercely. “We are\r\nrevolting!”\r\n\r\n“You don’t look it,” said the Guardian, gazing from one to another,\r\nadmiringly.\r\n\r\n“But we are!” cried Jinjur, stamping her foot, impatiently; “and we\r\nmean to conquer the Emerald City!”\r\n\r\n“Good gracious!” returned the surprised Guardian of the Gates; “what a\r\nnonsensical idea! Go home to your mothers, my good girls, and milk the\r\ncows and bake the bread. Don’t you know it’s a dangerous thing to\r\nconquer a city?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image109]\r\n\r\n“We are not afraid!” responded the General; and she looked so\r\ndetermined that it made the Guardian uneasy.\r\n\r\nSo he rang the bell for the Soldier with the Green Whiskers, and the\r\nnext minute was sorry he had done so. For immediately he was surrounded\r\nby a crowd of girls who drew the knitting-needles from their hair and\r\nbegan Jabbing them at the Guardian with the sharp points dangerously\r\nnear his fat cheeks and blinking eyes.\r\n\r\nThe poor man howled loudly for mercy and made no resistance when Jinjur\r\ndrew the bunch of keys from around his neck.\r\n\r\nFollowed by her Army the General now rushed to the gateway, where she\r\nwas confronted by the Royal Army of Oz—which was the other name for the\r\nSoldier with the Green Whiskers.\r\n\r\n“Halt!” he cried, and pointed his long gun full in the face of the\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nSome of the girls screamed and ran back, but General Jinjur bravely\r\nstood her ground and said, reproachfully:\r\n\r\n“Why, how now? Would you shoot a poor, defenceless girl?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the soldier. “for my gun isn’t loaded.”\r\n\r\n“Not loaded?”\r\n\r\n“No; for fear of accidents. And I’ve forgotten where I hid the powder\r\nand shot to load it with. But if you’ll wait a short time I’ll try to\r\nhunt them up.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t trouble yourself,” said Jinjur, cheerfully. Then she turned to\r\nher Army and cried:\r\n\r\n“Girls, the gun isn’t loaded!”\r\n\r\n“Hooray,” shrieked the rebels, delighted at this good news, and they\r\nproceeded to rush upon the Soldier with the Green Whiskers in such a\r\ncrowd that it was a wonder they didn’t stick the knitting-needles into\r\none another.\r\n\r\nBut the Royal Army of Oz was too much afraid of women to meet the\r\nonslaught. He simply turned about and ran with all his might through\r\nthe gate and toward the royal palace, while General Jinjur and her mob\r\nflocked into the unprotected City.\r\n\r\nIn this way was the Emerald City captured without a drop of blood being\r\nspilled. The Army of Revolt had become an Army of Conquerors!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image111]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image112]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image113]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow Plans an escape\r\n\r\n\r\nTip slipped away from the girls and followed swiftly after the Soldier\r\nwith the Green Whiskers. The invading army entered the City more\r\nslowly, for they stopped to dig emeralds out of the walls and\r\npaving-stones with the points of their knitting-needles. So the Soldier\r\nand the boy reached the palace before the news had spread that the City\r\nwas conquered.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow and Jack Pumpkinhead were still playing at quoits in the\r\ncourtyard when the game was interrupted by the abrupt entrance of the\r\nRoyal Army of Oz, who came flying in without his hat or gun, his\r\nclothes in sad disarray and his long beard floating a yard behind him\r\nas he ran.\r\n\r\n“Tally one for me,” said the Scarecrow, calmly “What’s wrong, my man?”\r\nhe added, addressing the Soldier.\r\n\r\n“Oh! your Majesty—your Majesty! The City is conquered!” gasped the\r\nRoyal Army, who was all out of breath.\r\n\r\n“This is quite sudden,” said the Scarecrow. “But please go and bar all\r\nthe doors and windows of the palace, while I show this Pumpkinhead how\r\nto throw a quoit.”\r\n\r\nThe Soldier hastened to do this, while Tip, who had arrived at his\r\nheels, remained in the courtyard to look at the Scarecrow with\r\nwondering eyes.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty continued to throw the quoits as coolly as if no danger\r\nthreatened his throne, but the Pumpkinhead, having caught sight of Tip,\r\nambled toward the boy as fast as his wooden legs would go.\r\n\r\n“Good afternoon, noble parent!” he cried, delightedly. “I’m glad to see\r\nyou are here. That terrible Saw-Horse ran away with me.”\r\n\r\n“I suspected it,” said Tip. “Did you get hurt? Are you cracked at all?”\r\n\r\n“No, I arrived safely,” answered Jack, “and his Majesty has been very\r\nkind indeed to me.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Soldier with the Green Whiskers returned, and the\r\nScarecrow asked:\r\n\r\n“By the way, who has conquered me?”\r\n\r\n“A regiment of girls, gathered from the four corners of the Land of\r\nOz,” replied the Soldier, still pale with fear.\r\n\r\n“But where was my Standing Army at the time?” inquired his Majesty,\r\nlooking at the Soldier, gravely.\r\n\r\n“Your Standing Army was running,” answered the fellow, honestly; “for\r\nno man could face the terrible weapons of the invaders.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Scarecrow, after a moment’s thought, “I don’t mind\r\nmuch the loss of my throne, for it’s a tiresome job to rule over the\r\nEmerald City. And this crown is so heavy that it makes my head ache.\r\nBut I hope the Conquerors have no intention of injuring me, just\r\nbecause I happen to be the King.”\r\n\r\n“I heard them, say” remarked Tip, with some hesitation, “that they\r\nintend to make a rag carpet of your outside and stuff their\r\nsofa-cushions with your inside.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am really in danger,” declared his Majesty, positively, “and it\r\nwill be wise for me to consider a means to escape.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image116]\r\n\r\n“Where can you go?” asked Jack Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n“Why, to my friend the Tin Woodman, who rules over the Winkies, and\r\ncalls himself their Emperor,” was the answer. “I am sure he will\r\nprotect me.”\r\n\r\nTip was looking out the window.\r\n\r\n“The palace is surrounded by the enemy,” said he. “It is too late to\r\nescape. They would soon tear you to pieces.”\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow sighed.\r\n\r\n“In an emergency,” he announced, “it is always a good thing to pause\r\nand reflect. Please excuse me while I pause and reflect.”\r\n\r\n“But we also are in danger,” said the Pumpkinhead, anxiously. “If any\r\nof these girls understand cooking, my end is not far off!”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” exclaimed the Scarecrow. “they’re too busy to cook, even if\r\nthey know how!”\r\n\r\n“But should I remain here a prisoner for any length of time,” protested\r\nJack, “I’m liable to spoil.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! then you would not be fit to associate with,” returned the\r\nScarecrow. “The matter is more serious than I suspected.”\r\n\r\n“You,” said the Pumpkinhead, gloomily, “are liable to live for many\r\nyears. My life is necessarily short. So I must take advantage of the\r\nfew days that remain to me.”\r\n\r\n“There, there! Don’t worry,” answered the Scarecrow soothingly; “if\r\nyou’ll keep quiet long enough for me to think, I’ll try to find some\r\nway for us all to escape.”\r\n\r\nSo the others waited in patient silence while the Scarecrow walked to a\r\ncorner and stood with his face to the wall for a good five minutes. At\r\nthe end of that time he faced them with a more cheerful expression upon\r\nhis painted face.\r\n\r\n“Where is the Saw-Horse you rode here?” he asked the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n“Why, I said he was a jewel, and so your man locked him up in the royal\r\ntreasury,” said Jack.\r\n\r\n“It was the only place I could think of your Majesty,” added the\r\nSoldier, fearing he had made a blunder.\r\n\r\n“It pleases me very much,” said the Scarecrow. “Has the animal been\r\nfed?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; I gave him a heaping peck of sawdust.”\r\n\r\n“Excellent!” cried the Scarecrow. “Bring the horse here at once.”\r\n\r\nThe Soldier hastened away, and presently they heard the clattering of\r\nthe horse’s wooden legs upon the pavement as he was led into the\r\ncourtyard.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty regarded the steed critically. “He doesn’t seem especially\r\ngraceful!” he remarked, musingly. “but I suppose he can run?”\r\n\r\n“He can, indeed,” said Tip, gazing upon the Saw-Horse admiringly.\r\n\r\n“Then, bearing us upon his back, he must make a dash through the ranks\r\nof the rebels and carry us to my friend the Tin Woodman,” announced the\r\nScarecrow.\r\n\r\n“He can’t carry four!” objected Tip.\r\n\r\n“No, but he may be induced to carry three,” said his Majesty. “I shall\r\ntherefore leave my Royal Army Behind. For, from the ease with which he\r\nwas conquered, I have little confidence in his powers.”\r\n\r\n“Still, he can run,” declared Tip, laughing.\r\n\r\n“I expected this blow” said the Soldier, sulkily; “but I can bear it. I\r\nshall disguise myself by cutting off my lovely green whiskers. And,\r\nafter all, it is no more dangerous to face those reckless girls than to\r\nride this fiery, untamed wooden horse!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right,” observed his Majesty. “But, for my part, not\r\nbeing a soldier, I am fond of danger. Now, my boy, you must mount\r\nfirst. And please sit as close to the horse’s neck as possible.”\r\n\r\nTip climbed quickly to his place, and the Soldier and the Scarecrow\r\nmanaged to hoist the Pumpkinhead to a seat just behind him. There\r\nremained so little space for the King that he was liable to fall off as\r\nsoon as the horse started.\r\n\r\n“Fetch a clothesline,” said the King to his Army, “and tie us all\r\ntogether. Then if one falls off we will all fall off.”\r\n\r\nAnd while the Soldier was gone for the clothesline his Majesty\r\ncontinued, “it is well for me to be careful, for my very existence is\r\nin danger.”\r\n\r\n“I have to be as careful as you do,” said Jack.\r\n\r\n“Not exactly,” replied the Scarecrow. “for if anything happened to me,\r\nthat would be the end of me. But if anything happened to you, they\r\ncould use you for seed.”\r\n\r\nThe Soldier now returned with a long line and tied all three firmly\r\ntogether, also lashing them to the body of the Saw-Horse; so there\r\nseemed little danger of their tumbling off.\r\n\r\n“Now throw open the gates,” commanded the Scarecrow, “and we will make\r\na dash to liberty or to death.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image121]\r\n\r\nThe courtyard in which they were standing was located in the center of\r\nthe great palace, which surrounded it on all sides. But in one place a\r\npassage led to an outer gateway, which the Soldier had barred by order\r\nof his sovereign. It was through this gateway his Majesty proposed to\r\nescape, and the Royal Army now led the Saw-Horse along the passage and\r\nunbarred the gate, which swung backward with a loud crash.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Tip to the horse, “you must save us all. Run as fast as you\r\ncan for the gate of the City, and don’t let anything stop you.”\r\n\r\n“All right!” answered the Saw-Horse, gruffly, and dashed away so\r\nsuddenly that Tip had to gasp for breath and hold firmly to the post he\r\nhad driven into the creature’s neck.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the girls, who stood outside guarding the palace, were\r\nknocked over by the Saw-Horse’s mad rush. Others ran screaming out of\r\nthe way, and only one or two jabbed their knitting-needles frantically\r\nat the escaping prisoners. Tip got one small prick in his left arm,\r\nwhich smarted for an hour afterward; but the needles had no effect upon\r\nthe Scarecrow or Jack Pumpkinhead, who never even suspected they were\r\nbeing prodded.\r\n\r\nAs for the Saw-Horse, he made a wonderful record upsetting a fruit\r\ncart, overturning several meek looking men, and finally bowling over\r\nthe new Guardian of the Gate—a fussy little fat woman appointed by\r\nGeneral Jinjur.\r\n\r\nNor did the impetuous charger stop then. Once outside the walls of the\r\nEmerald City he dashed along the road to the West with fast and violent\r\nleaps that shook the breath out of the boy and filled the Scarecrow\r\nwith wonder.\r\n\r\nJack had ridden at this mad rate once before, so he devoted every\r\neffort to holding, with both hands, his pumpkin head upon its stick,\r\nenduring meantime the dreadful jolting with the courage of a\r\nphilosopher.\r\n\r\n“Slow him up! Slow him up!” shouted the Scarecrow. “My straw is all\r\nshaking down into my legs.”\r\n\r\nBut Tip had no breath to speak, so the Saw-Horse continued his wild\r\ncareer unchecked and with unabated speed.\r\n\r\nPresently they came to the banks of a wide river, and without a pause\r\nthe wooden steed gave one final leap and launched them all in mid-air.\r\n\r\nA second later they were rolling, splashing and bobbing about in the\r\nwater, the horse struggling frantically to find a rest for its feet and\r\nits riders being first plunged beneath the rapid current and then\r\nfloating upon the surface like corks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image123]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image124]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image125]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Journey to the Tin Woodman\r\n\r\n\r\nTip was well soaked and dripping water from every angle of his body.\r\nBut he managed to lean forward and shout in the ear of the Saw-Horse:\r\n\r\n“Keep still, you fool! Keep still!”\r\n\r\nThe horse at once ceased struggling and floated calmly upon the\r\nsurface, its wooden body being as buoyant as a raft.\r\n\r\n“What does that word ‘fool’ mean?” enquired the horse.\r\n\r\n“It is a term of reproach,” answered Tip, somewhat ashamed of the\r\nexpression. “I only use it when I am angry.”\r\n\r\n“Then it pleases me to be able to call you a fool, in return,” said the\r\nhorse. “For I did not make the river, nor put it in our way; so only a\r\nterm of, reproach is fit for one who becomes angry with me for falling\r\ninto the water.”\r\n\r\n“That is quite evident,” replied Tip; “so I will acknowledge myself in\r\nthe wrong.” Then he called out to the Pumpkinhead: “are you all right,\r\nJack?”\r\n\r\nThere was no reply. So the boy called to the King “are you all right,\r\nyour majesty?”\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow groaned.\r\n\r\n“I’m all wrong, somehow,” he said, in a weak voice. “How very wet this\r\nwater is!”\r\n\r\nTip was bound so tightly by the cord that he could not turn his head to\r\nlook at his companions; so he said to the Saw-Horse:\r\n\r\n“Paddle with your legs toward the shore.”\r\n\r\nThe horse obeyed, and although their progress was slow they finally\r\nreached the opposite river bank at a place where it was low enough to\r\nenable the creature to scramble upon dry land.\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty the boy managed to get his knife out of his pocket\r\nand cut the cords that bound the riders to one another and to the\r\nwooden horse. He heard the Scarecrow fall to the ground with a mushy\r\nsound, and then he himself quickly dismounted and looked at his friend\r\nJack.\r\n\r\nThe wooden body, with its gorgeous clothing, still sat upright upon the\r\nhorse’s back; but the pumpkin head was gone, and only the sharpened\r\nstick that served for a neck was visible. As for the Scarecrow, the\r\nstraw in his body had shaken down with the jolting and packed itself\r\ninto his legs and the lower part of his body—which appeared very plump\r\nand round while his upper half seemed like an empty sack. Upon his head\r\nthe Scarecrow still wore the heavy crown, which had been sewed on to\r\nprevent his losing it; but the head was now so damp and limp that the\r\nweight of the gold and jewels sagged forward and crushed the painted\r\nface into a mass of wrinkles that made him look exactly like a Japanese\r\npug dog.\r\n\r\nTip would have laughed—had he not been so anxious about his man Jack.\r\nBut the Scarecrow, however damaged, was all there, while the pumpkin\r\nhead that was so necessary to Jack’s existence was missing; so the boy\r\nseized a long pole that fortunately lay near at hand and anxiously\r\nturned again toward the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image128]\r\n\r\nFar out upon the waters he sighted the golden hue of the pumpkin, which\r\ngently bobbed up and down with the motion of the waves. At that moment\r\nit was quite out of Tip’s reach, but after a time it floated nearer and\r\nstill nearer until the boy was able to reach it with his pole and draw\r\nit to the shore. Then he brought it to the top of the bank, carefully\r\nwiped the water from its pumpkin face with his handkerchief, and ran\r\nwith it to Jack and replaced the head upon the man’s neck.\r\n\r\n“Dear me!” were Jack’s first words. “What a dreadful experience! I\r\nwonder if water is liable to spoil pumpkins?”\r\n\r\nTip did not think a reply was necessary, for he knew that the Scarecrow\r\nalso stood in need of his help. So he carefully removed the straw from\r\nthe King’s body and legs, and spread it out in the sun to dry. The wet\r\nclothing he hung over the body of the Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n“If water spoils pumpkins,” observed Jack, with a deep sigh, “then my\r\ndays are numbered.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve never noticed that water spoils pumpkins,” returned Tip; “unless\r\nthe water happens to be boiling. If your head isn’t cracked, my friend,\r\nyou must be in fairly good condition.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my head isn’t cracked in the least,” declared Jack, more\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\n“Then don’t worry,” retorted the boy. “Care once killed a cat.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Jack, seriously, “I am very glad indeed that I am not a\r\ncat.”\r\n\r\nThe sun was fast drying their clothing, and Tip stirred up his\r\nMajesty’s straw so that the warm rays might absorb the moisture and\r\nmake it as crisp and dry as ever. When this had been accomplished he\r\nstuffed the Scarecrow into symmetrical shape and smoothed out his face\r\nso that he wore his usual gay and charming expression.\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much,” said the monarch, brightly, as he walked about\r\nand found himself to be well balanced. “There are several distinct\r\nadvantages in being a Scarecrow. For if one has friends near at hand to\r\nrepair damages, nothing very serious can happen to you.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if hot sunshine is liable to crack pumpkins,” said Jack, with\r\nan anxious ring in his voice.\r\n\r\n“Not at all—not at all!” replied the Scarecrow, gaily. “All you need\r\nfear, my boy, is old age. When your golden youth has decayed we shall\r\nquickly part company—but you needn’t look forward to it; we’ll discover\r\nthe fact ourselves, and notify you. But come! Let us resume our\r\njourney. I am anxious to greet my friend the Tin Woodman.”\r\n\r\nSo they remounted the Saw-Horse, Tip holding to the post, the\r\nPumpkinhead clinging to Tip, and the Scarecrow with both arms around\r\nthe wooden form of Jack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image131]\r\n\r\n“Go slowly, for now there is no danger of pursuit,” said Tip to his\r\nsteed.\r\n\r\n“All right!” responded the creature, in a voice rather gruff.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you a little hoarse?” asked the Pumpkinhead politely.\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse gave an angry prance and rolled one knotty eye backward\r\ntoward Tip.\r\n\r\n“See here,” he growled, “can’t you protect me from insult?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure!” answered Tip, soothingly. “I am sure Jack meant no harm.\r\nAnd it will not do for us to quarrel, you know; we must all remain good\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll have nothing more to do with that Pumpkinhead,” declared the\r\nSaw-Horse, viciously. “he loses his head too easily to suit me.”\r\n\r\nThere seemed no fitting reply to this speech, so for a time they rode\r\nalong in silence.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the Scarecrow remarked:\r\n\r\n“This reminds me of old times. It was upon this grassy knoll that I\r\nonce saved Dorothy from the Stinging Bees of the Wicked Witch of the\r\nWest.”\r\n\r\n“Do Stinging Bees injure pumpkins?” asked Jack, glancing around\r\nfearfully.\r\n\r\n“They are all dead, so it doesn’t matter,” replied the Scarecrow. “And\r\nhere is where Nick Chopper destroyed the Wicked Witch’s Grey Wolves.”\r\n\r\n“Who was Nick Chopper?” asked Tip.\r\n\r\n“That is the name of my friend the Tin Woodman, answered his Majesty.\r\nAnd here is where the Winged Monkeys captured and bound us, and flew\r\naway with little Dorothy,” he continued, after they had traveled a\r\nlittle way farther.\r\n\r\n“Do Winged Monkeys ever eat pumpkins?” asked Jack, with a shiver of\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n“I do not know; but you have little cause to, worry, for the Winged\r\nMonkeys are now the slaves of Glinda the Good, who owns the Golden Cap\r\nthat commands their services,” said the Scarecrow, reflectively.\r\n\r\nThen the stuffed monarch became lost in thought recalling the days of\r\npast adventures. And the Saw-Horse rocked and rolled over the\r\nflower-strewn fields and carried its riders swiftly upon their way.\r\n\r\nTwilight fell, bye and bye, and then the dark shadows of night. So Tip\r\nstopped the horse and they all proceeded to dismount.\r\n\r\n“I’m tired out,” said the boy, yawning wearily; “and the grass is soft\r\nand cool. Let us lie down here and sleep until morning.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t sleep,” said Jack.\r\n\r\n“I never do,” said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“I do not even know what sleep is,” said the Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n“Still, we must have consideration for this poor boy, who is made of\r\nflesh and blood and bone, and gets tired,” suggested the Scarecrow, in\r\nhis usual thoughtful manner. “I remember it was the same way with\r\nlittle Dorothy. We always had to sit through the night while she\r\nslept.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” said Tip, meekly, “but I can’t help it. And I’m dreadfully\r\nhungry, too!”\r\n\r\n“Here is a new danger!” remarked Jack, gloomily. “I hope you are not\r\nfond of eating pumpkins.”\r\n\r\n“Not unless they’re stewed and made into pies,” answered the boy,\r\nlaughing. “So have no fears of me, friend Jack.”\r\n\r\n“What a coward that Pumpkinhead is!” said the Saw-Horse, scornfully.\r\n\r\n“You might be a coward yourself, if you knew you were liable to spoil!”\r\nretorted Jack, angrily.\r\n\r\n“There!—there!” interrupted the Scarecrow; “don’t let us quarrel. We\r\nall have our weaknesses, dear friends; so we must strive to be\r\nconsiderate of one another. And since this poor boy is hungry and has\r\nnothing whatever to eat, let us all remain quiet and allow him to\r\nsleep; for it is said that in sleep a mortal may forget even hunger.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you!” exclaimed Tip, gratefully. “Your Majesty is fully as good\r\nas you are wise—and that is saying a good deal!”\r\n\r\nHe then stretched himself upon the grass and, using the stuffed form of\r\nthe Scarecrow for a pillow, was presently fast asleep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image135]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image136]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image137]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Nickel-Plated Emperor\r\n\r\n\r\nTip awoke soon after dawn, but the Scarecrow had already risen and\r\nplucked, with his clumsy fingers, a double-handful of ripe berries from\r\nsome bushes near by. These the boy ate greedily, finding them an ample\r\nbreakfast, and afterward the little party resumed its Journey.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour’s ride they reached the summit of a hill from whence they\r\nespied the City of the Winkies and noted the tall domes of the\r\nEmperor’s palace rising from the clusters of more modest dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow became greatly animated at this sight, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“How delighted I shall be to see my old friend the Tin Woodman again! I\r\nhope that he rules his people more successfully than I have ruled\r\nmine!”\r\n\r\n“Is the Tin Woodman the Emperor of the Winkies?” asked the horse.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed. They invited him to rule over them soon after the Wicked\r\nWitch was destroyed; and as Nick Chopper has the best heart in all the\r\nworld I am sure he has proved an excellent and able emperor.”\r\n\r\n“I thought that ‘Emperor’ was the title of a person who rules an\r\nempire,” said Tip, “and the Country of the Winkies is only a Kingdom.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t mention that to the Tin Woodman!” exclaimed the Scarecrow,\r\nearnestly. “You would hurt his feelings terribly. He is a proud man, as\r\nhe has every reason to be, and it pleases him to be termed Emperor\r\nrather than King.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure it makes no difference to me,” replied the boy.\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse now ambled forward at a pace so fast that its riders had\r\nhard work to stick upon its back; so there was little further\r\nconversation until they drew up beside the palace steps.\r\n\r\nAn aged Winkie, dressed in a uniform of silver cloth, came forward to\r\nassist them to alight. Said the Scarecrow to his personage:\r\n\r\n“Show us at once to your master, the Emperor.”\r\n\r\nThe man looked from one to another of the party in an embarrassed way,\r\nand finally answered:\r\n\r\n“I fear I must ask you to wait for a time. The Emperor is not receiving\r\nthis morning.”\r\n\r\n“How is that?” enquired the Scarecrow, anxiously. “I hope nothing has\r\nhappened to him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; nothing serious,” returned the man. “But this is his Majesty’s\r\nday for being polished; and just now his august presence is thickly\r\nsmeared with putz-pomade.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see!” cried the Scarecrow, greatly reassured. “My friend was\r\never inclined to be a dandy, and I suppose he is now more proud than\r\never of his personal appearance.”\r\n\r\n“He is, indeed,” said the man, with a polite bow. “Our mighty Emperor\r\nhas lately caused himself to be nickel-plated.”\r\n\r\n“Good Gracious!” the Scarecrow exclaimed at hearing this. “If his wit\r\nbears the same polish, how sparkling it must be! But show us in—I’m\r\nsure the Emperor will receive us, even in his present state”\r\n\r\n“The Emperor’s state is always magnificent,” said the man. “But I will\r\nventure to tell him of your arrival, and will receive his commands\r\nconcerning you.”\r\n\r\nSo the party followed the servant into a splendid ante-room, and the\r\nSaw-Horse ambled awkwardly after them, having no knowledge that a horse\r\nmight be expected to remain outside.\r\n\r\nThe travelers were at first somewhat awed by their surroundings, and\r\neven the Scarecrow seemed impressed as he examined the rich hangings of\r\nsilver cloth caught up into knots and fastened with tiny silver axes.\r\nUpon a handsome center-table stood a large silver oil-can, richly\r\nengraved with scenes from the past adventures of the Tin Woodman,\r\nDorothy, the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow: the lines of the\r\nengraving being traced upon the silver in yellow gold. On the walls\r\nhung several portraits, that of the Scarecrow seeming to be the most\r\nprominent and carefully executed, while a the large painting of the\r\nfamous Wizard of Oz, in act of presenting the Tin Woodman with a heart,\r\ncovered almost one entire end of the room.\r\n\r\nWhile the visitors gazed at these things in silent admiration they\r\nsuddenly heard a loud voice in the next room exclaim:\r\n\r\n“Well! well! well! What a great surprise!”\r\n\r\nAnd then the door burst open and Nick Chopper rushed into their midst\r\nand caught the Scarecrow in a close and loving embrace that creased him\r\ninto many folds and wrinkles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image141]\r\n\r\n“My dear old friend! My noble comrade!” cried the Tin Woodman,\r\njoyfully. “how delighted! I am to meet you once again.”\r\n\r\nAnd then he released the Scarecrow and held him at arms’ length while\r\nhe surveyed the beloved, painted features.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! the face of the Scarecrow and many portions of his body bore\r\ngreat blotches of putz-pomade; for the Tin Woodman, in his eagerness to\r\nwelcome his friend, had quite forgotten the condition of his toilet and\r\nhad rubbed the thick coating of paste from his own body to that of his\r\ncomrade.\r\n\r\n“Dear me!” said the Scarecrow dolefully. “What a mess I’m in!”\r\n\r\n“Never mind, my friend,” returned the Tin Woodman, “I’ll send you to my\r\nImperial Laundry, and you’ll come out as good as new.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t I be mangled?” asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“No, indeed!” was the reply. “But tell me, how came your Majesty here?\r\nand who are your companions?”\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow, with great politeness, introduced Tip and Jack\r\nPumpkinhead, and the latter personage seemed to interest the Tin\r\nWoodman greatly.\r\n\r\n“You are not very substantial, I must admit,” said the Emperor. “but\r\nyou are certainly unusual, and therefore worthy to become a member of\r\nour select society.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image143]\r\n\r\n“I thank your Majesty,” said Jack, humbly.\r\n\r\n“I hope you are enjoying good health?” continued the Woodman.\r\n\r\n“At present, yes;” replied the Pumpkinhead, with a sigh; “but I am in\r\nconstant terror of the day when I shall spoil.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” said the Emperor—but in a kindly, sympathetic tone. “Do\r\nnot, I beg of you, dampen today’s sun with the showers of tomorrow. For\r\nbefore your head has time to spoil you can have it canned, and in that\r\nway it may be preserved indefinitely.”\r\n\r\nTip, during this conversation, was looking at the Woodman with\r\nundisguised amazement, and noticed that the celebrated Emperor of the\r\nWinkies was composed entirely of pieces of tin, neatly soldered and\r\nriveted together into the form of a man. He rattled and clanked a\r\nlittle, as he moved, but in the main he seemed to be most cleverly\r\nconstructed, and his appearance was only marred by the thick coating of\r\npolishing-paste that covered him from head to foot.\r\n\r\nThe boy’s intent gaze caused the Tin Woodman to remember that he was\r\nnot in the most presentable condition, so he begged his friends to\r\nexcuse him while he retired to his private apartment and allowed his\r\nservants to polish him. This was accomplished in a short time, and when\r\nthe emperor returned his nickel-plated body shone so magnificently that\r\nthe Scarecrow heartily congratulated him on his improved appearance.\r\n\r\n“That nickel-plate was, I confess, a happy thought,” said Nick; “and it\r\nwas the more necessary because I had become somewhat scratched during\r\nmy adventurous experiences. You will observe this engraved star upon my\r\nleft breast. It not only indicates where my excellent heart lies, but\r\ncovers very neatly the patch made by the Wonderful Wizard when he\r\nplaced that valued organ in my breast with his own skillful hands.”\r\n\r\n“Is your heart, then, a hand-organ?” asked the Pumpkinhead, curiously.\r\n\r\n“By no means,” responded the emperor, with dignity. “It is, I am\r\nconvinced, a strictly orthodox heart, although somewhat larger and\r\nwarmer than most people possess.”\r\n\r\nThen he turned to the Scarecrow and asked:\r\n\r\n“Are your subjects happy and contented, my dear friend?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot, say” was the reply. “for the girls of Oz have risen in\r\nrevolt and driven me out of the emerald City.”\r\n\r\n“Great Goodness!” cried the Tin Woodman, “What a calamity! They surely\r\ndo not complain of your wise and gracious rule?”\r\n\r\n“No; but they say it is a poor rule that don’t work both ways,”\r\nanswered the Scarecrow; “and these females are also of the opinion that\r\nmen have ruled the land long enough. So they have captured my city,\r\nrobbed the treasury of all its jewels, and are running things to suit\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me! What an extraordinary idea!” cried the Emperor, who was both\r\nshocked and surprised.\r\n\r\n“And I heard some of them say,” said Tip, “that they intend to march\r\nhere and capture the castle and city of the Tin Woodman.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! we must not give them time to do that,” said the Emperor, quickly;\r\n“we will go at once and recapture the Emerald City and place the\r\nScarecrow again upon his throne.”\r\n\r\n“I was sure you would help me,” remarked the Scarecrow in a pleased\r\nvoice. “How large an army can you assemble?”\r\n\r\n“We do not need an army,” replied the Woodman. “We four, with the aid\r\nof my gleaming axe, are enough to strike terror into the hearts of the\r\nrebels.”\r\n\r\n“We five,” corrected the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n“Five?” repeated the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n“Yes; the Saw-Horse is brave and fearless,” answered Jack, forgetting\r\nhis recent quarrel with the quadruped.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman looked around him in a puzzled way, for the Saw-Horse\r\nhad until now remained quietly standing in a corner, where the Emperor\r\nhad not noticed him. Tip immediately called the odd-looking creature to\r\nthem, and it approached so awkwardly that it nearly upset the beautiful\r\ncenter-table and the engraved oil-can.\r\n\r\n“I begin to think,” remarked the Tin Woodman as he looked earnestly at\r\nthe Saw-Horse, “that wonders will never cease! How came this creature\r\nalive?”\r\n\r\n“I did it with a magic powder,” modestly asserted the boy. “and the\r\nSaw-Horse has been very useful to us.”\r\n\r\n“He enabled us to escape the rebels,” added the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“Then we must surely accept him as a comrade,” declared the emperor. “A\r\nlive Saw-Horse is a distinct novelty, and should prove an interesting\r\nstudy. Does he know anything?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I cannot claim any great experience in life,” the Saw-Horse\r\nanswered for himself. “but I seem to learn very quickly, and often it\r\noccurs to me that I know more than any of those around me.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you do,” said the emperor; “for experience does not always\r\nmean wisdom. But time is precious just now, so let us quickly make\r\npreparations to start upon our Journey.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image146]\r\n\r\nThe emperor called his Lord High Chancellor and instructed him how to\r\nrun the kingdom during his absence. Meanwhile the Scarecrow was taken\r\napart and the painted sack that served him for a head was carefully\r\nlaundered and restuffed with the brains originally given him by the\r\ngreat Wizard. His clothes were also cleaned and pressed by the Imperial\r\ntailors, and his crown polished and again sewed upon his head, for the\r\nTin Woodman insisted he should not renounce this badge of royalty. The\r\nScarecrow now presented a very respectable appearance, and although in\r\nno way addicted to vanity he was quite pleased with himself and\r\nstrutted a trifle as he walked. While this was being done Tip mended\r\nthe wooden limbs of Jack Pumpkinhead and made them stronger than\r\nbefore, and the Saw-Horse was also inspected to see if he was in good\r\nworking order.\r\n\r\nThen bright and early the next morning they set out upon the return\r\nJourney to the emerald City, the Tin Woodman bearing upon his shoulder\r\na gleaming axe and leading the way, while the Pumpkinhead rode upon the\r\nSaw-Horse and Tip and the Scarecrow walked upon either side to make\r\nsure that he didn’t fall off or become damaged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image149]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image150]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image152]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, General Jinjur—who, you will remember, commanded the Army of\r\nRevolt—was rendered very uneasy by the escape of the Scarecrow from the\r\nEmerald City. She feared, and with good reason, that if his Majesty and\r\nthe Tin Woodman Joined forces, it would mean danger to her and her\r\nentire army; for the people of Oz had not yet forgotten the deeds of\r\nthese famous heroes, who had passed successfully through so many\r\nstartling adventures.\r\n\r\nSo Jinjur sent post-haste for old Mombi, the witch, and promised her\r\nlarge rewards if she would come to the assistance of the rebel army.\r\n\r\nMombi was furious at the trick Tip had played upon her as well as at\r\nhis escape and the theft of the precious Powder of Life; so she needed\r\nno urging to induce her to travel to the Emerald City to assist Jinjur\r\nin defeating the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, who had made Tip one of\r\ntheir friends.\r\n\r\nMombi had no sooner arrived at the royal palace than she discovered, by\r\nmeans of her secret magic, that the adventurers were starting upon\r\ntheir Journey to the Emerald City; so she retired to a small room high\r\nup in a tower and locked herself in while she practised such arts as\r\nshe could command to prevent the return of the Scarecrow and his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nThat was why the Tin Woodman presently stopped and said:\r\n\r\n“Something very curious has happened. I ought to know by heart and\r\nevery step of this Journey, yet I fear we have already lost our way.”\r\n\r\n“That is quite impossible!” protested the Scarecrow. “Why do you think,\r\nmy dear friend, that we have gone astray?”\r\n\r\n“Why, here before us is a great field of sunflowers—and I never saw\r\nthis field before in all my life.”\r\n\r\nAt these words they all looked around, only to find that they were\r\nindeed surrounded by a field of tall stalks, every stalk bearing at its\r\ntop a gigantic sunflower. And not only were these flowers almost\r\nblinding in their vivid hues of red and gold, but each one whirled\r\naround upon its stalk like a miniature wind-mill, completely dazzling\r\nthe vision of the beholders and so mystifying them that they knew not\r\nwhich way to turn.\r\n\r\n“It’s witchcraft!” exclaimed Tip.\r\n\r\nWhile they paused, hesitating and wondering, the Tin Woodman uttered a\r\ncry of impatience and advanced with swinging axe to cut down the stalks\r\nbefore him. But now the sunflowers suddenly stopped their rapid\r\nwhirling, and the travelers plainly saw a girl’s face appear in the\r\ncenter of each flower. These lovely faces looked upon the astonished\r\nband with mocking smiles, and then burst into a chorus of merry\r\nlaughter at the dismay their appearance caused.\r\n\r\n“Stop! stop!” cried Tip, seizing the Woodman’s arm; “they’re alive!\r\nthey’re girls!”\r\n\r\nAt that moment the flowers began whirling again, and the faces faded\r\naway and were lost in the rapid revolutions.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman dropped his axe and sat down upon the ground.\r\n\r\n“It would be heartless to chop down those pretty creatures,” said he,\r\ndespondently. “and yet I do not know how else we can proceed upon our\r\nway”\r\n\r\n“They looked to me strangely like the faces of the Army of Revolt,”\r\nmused the Scarecrow. “But I cannot conceive how the girls could have\r\nfollowed us here so quickly.”\r\n\r\n“I believe it’s magic,” said Tip, positively, “and that someone is\r\nplaying a trick upon us. I’ve known old Mombi do things like that\r\nbefore. Probably it’s nothing more than an illusion, and there are no\r\nsunflowers here at all.”\r\n\r\n“Then let us shut our eyes and walk forward,” suggested the Woodman.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” replied the Scarecrow. “My eyes are not painted to shut.\r\nBecause you happen to have tin eyelids, you must not imagine we are all\r\nbuilt in the same way.”\r\n\r\n“And the eyes of the Saw-Horse are knot eyes,” said Jack, leaning\r\nforward to examine them.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, you must ride quickly forward,” commanded Tip, “and we\r\nwill follow after you and so try to escape. My eyes are already so\r\ndazzled that I can scarcely see.”\r\n\r\nSo the Pumpkinhead rode boldly forward, and Tip grasped the stub tail\r\nof the Saw-Horse and followed with closed eyes. The Scarecrow and the\r\nTin Woodman brought up the rear, and before they had gone many yards a\r\nJoyful shout from Jack announced that the way was clear before them.\r\n\r\nThen all paused to look backward, but not a trace of the field of\r\nsunflowers remained.\r\n\r\nMore cheerfully, now they proceeded upon their Journey; but old Mombi\r\nhad so changed the appearance of the landscape that they would surely\r\nhave been lost had not the Scarecrow wisely concluded to take their\r\ndirection from the sun. For no witch-craft could change the course of\r\nthe sun, and it was therefore a safe guide.\r\n\r\nHowever, other difficulties lay before them. The Saw-Horse stepped into\r\na rabbit hole and fell to the ground. The Pumpkinhead was pitched high\r\ninto the air, and his history would probably have ended at that exact\r\nmoment had not the Tin Woodman skillfully caught the pumpkin as it\r\ndescended and saved it from injury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image156]\r\n\r\nTip soon had it fitted to the neck again and replaced Jack upon his\r\nfeet. But the Saw-Horse did not escape so easily. For when his leg was\r\npulled from the rabbit hole it was found to be broken short off, and\r\nmust be replaced or repaired before he could go a step farther.\r\n\r\n“This is quite serious,” said the Tin Woodman. “If there were trees\r\nnear by I might soon manufacture another leg for this animal; but I\r\ncannot see even a shrub for miles around.”\r\n\r\n“And there are neither fences nor houses in this part of the land of\r\nOz,” added the Scarecrow, disconsolately.\r\n\r\n“Then what shall we do?” enquired the boy.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I must start my brains working,” replied his Majesty the\r\nScarecrow; “for experience has, taught me that I can do anything if I\r\nbut take time to think it out.”\r\n\r\n“Let us all think,” said Tip; “and perhaps we shall find a way to\r\nrepair the Saw-Horse.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image158]\r\n\r\nSo they sat in a row upon the grass and began to think, while the\r\nSaw-Horse occupied itself by gazing curiously upon its broken limb.\r\n\r\n“Does it hurt?” asked the Tin Woodman, in a soft, sympathetic voice.\r\n\r\n“Not in the least,” returned the Saw-Horse; “but my pride is injured to\r\nfind that my anatomy is so brittle.”\r\n\r\nFor a time the little group remained in silent thought. Presently the\r\nTin Woodman raised his head and looked over the fields.\r\n\r\n“What sort of creature is that which approaches us?” he asked,\r\nwonderingly.\r\n\r\nThe others followed his gaze, and discovered coming toward them the\r\nmost extraordinary object they had ever beheld. It advanced quickly and\r\nnoiselessly over the soft grass and in a few minutes stood before the\r\nadventurers and regarded them with an astonishment equal to their own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image159]\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow was calm under all circumstances.\r\n\r\n“Good morning!” he said, politely.\r\n\r\nThe stranger removed his hat with a flourish, bowed very low, and then\r\nresponded:\r\n\r\n“Good morning, one and all. I hope you are, as an aggregation, enjoying\r\nexcellent health. Permit me to present my card.”\r\n\r\nWith this courteous speech it extended a card toward the Scarecrow, who\r\naccepted it, turned it over and over, and handed it with a shake of his\r\nhead to Tip.\r\n\r\nThe boy read aloud:\r\n\r\n“MR. H. M. WOGGLE-BUG, T. E.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me!” ejaculated the Pumpkinhead, staring somewhat intently.\r\n\r\n“How very peculiar!” said the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\nTip’s eyes were round and wondering, and the Saw-Horse uttered a sigh\r\nand turned away its head.\r\n\r\n“Are you really a Woggle-Bug?” enquired the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“Most certainly, my dear sir!” answered the stranger, briskly. “Is not\r\nmy name upon the card?”\r\n\r\n“It is,” said the Scarecrow. “But may I ask what ‘H. M.’ stands for?”\r\n\r\n“‘H. M.’ means Highly Magnified,” returned the Woggle-Bug, proudly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see.” The Scarecrow viewed the stranger critically. “And are\r\nyou, in truth, highly magnified?”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the Woggle-Bug, “I take you for a gentleman of judgment and\r\ndiscernment. Does it not occur to you that I am several thousand times\r\ngreater than any Woggle-Bug you ever saw before? Therefore it is\r\nplainly evident that I am Highly Magnified, and there is no good reason\r\nwhy you should doubt the fact.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” returned the Scarecrow. “My brains are slightly mixed\r\nsince I was last laundered. Would it be improper for me to ask, also,\r\nwhat the ‘T.E.’ at the end of your name stands for?”\r\n\r\n“Those letters express my degree,” answered the Woggle-Bug, with a\r\ncondescending smile. “To be more explicit, the initials mean that I am\r\nThoroughly Educated.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said the Scarecrow, much relieved.\r\n\r\nTip had not yet taken his eyes off this wonderful personage. What he\r\nsaw was a great, round, buglike body supported upon two slender legs\r\nwhich ended in delicate feet—the toes curling upward. The body of the\r\nWoggle-Bug was rather flat, and judging from what could be seen of it\r\nwas of a glistening dark brown color upon the back, while the front was\r\nstriped with alternate bands of light brown and white, blending\r\ntogether at the edges. Its arms were fully as slender as its legs, and\r\nupon a rather long neck was perched its head—not unlike the head of a\r\nman, except that its nose ended in a curling antenna, or “feeler,” and\r\nits ears from the upper points bore antennae that decorated the sides\r\nof its head like two miniature, curling pig tails. It must be admitted\r\nthat the round, black eyes were rather bulging in appearance; but the\r\nexpression upon the Woggle-Bug’s face was by no means unpleasant.\r\n\r\nFor dress the insect wore a dark-blue swallowtail coat with a yellow\r\nsilk lining and a flower in the button-hole; a vest of white duck that\r\nstretched tightly across the wide body; knickerbockers of fawn-colored\r\nplush, fastened at the knees with gilt buckles; and, perched upon its\r\nsmall head, was jauntily set a tall silk hat.\r\n\r\nStanding upright before our amazed friends the Woggle-Bug appeared to\r\nbe fully as tall as the Tin Woodman; and surely no bug in all the Land\r\nof Oz had ever before attained so enormous a size.\r\n\r\n“I confess,” said the Scarecrow, “that your abrupt appearance has\r\ncaused me surprise, and no doubt has startled my companions. I hope,\r\nhowever, that this circumstance will not distress you. We shall\r\nprobably get used to you in time.”\r\n\r\n“Do not apologize, I beg of you!” returned the Woggle-Bug, earnestly.\r\n“It affords me great pleasure to surprise people; for surely I cannot\r\nbe classed with ordinary insects and am entitled to both curiosity and\r\nadmiration from those I meet.”\r\n\r\n“You are, indeed,” agreed his Majesty.\r\n\r\n“If you will permit me to seat myself in your august company,”\r\ncontinued the stranger, “I will gladly relate my history, so that you\r\nwill be better able to comprehend my unusual—may I say\r\nremarkable?—appearance.”\r\n\r\n“You may say what you please,” answered the Tin Woodman, briefly.\r\n\r\nSo the Woggle-Bug sat down upon the grass, facing the little group of\r\nwanderers, and told them the following story:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image164]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image165]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Highly Magnified History\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is but honest that I should acknowledge at the beginning of my\r\nrecital that I was born an ordinary Woggle-Bug,” began the creature, in\r\na frank and friendly tone. “Knowing no better, I used my arms as well\r\nas my legs for walking, and crawled under the edges of stones or hid\r\namong the roots of grasses with no thought beyond finding a few insects\r\nsmaller than myself to feed upon.\r\n\r\n“The chill nights rendered me stiff and motionless, for I wore no\r\nclothing, but each morning the warm rays of the sun gave me new life\r\nand restored me to activity. A horrible existence is this, but you must\r\nremember it is the regular ordained existence of Woggle-Bugs, as well\r\nas of many other tiny creatures that inhabit the earth.\r\n\r\n“But Destiny had singled me out, humble though I was, for a grander\r\nfate! One day I crawled near to a country school house, and my\r\ncuriosity being excited by the monotonous hum of the students within, I\r\nmade bold to enter and creep along a crack between two boards until I\r\nreached the far end, where, in front of a hearth of glowing embers, sat\r\nthe master at his desk.\r\n\r\n“No one noticed so small a creature as a Woggle-Bug, and when I found\r\nthat the hearth was even warmer and more comfortable than the sunshine,\r\nI resolved to establish my future home beside it. So I found a charming\r\nnest between two bricks and hid myself therein for many, many months.\r\n\r\n“Professor Nowitall is, doubtless, the most famous scholar in the land\r\nof Oz, and after a few days I began to listen to the lectures and\r\ndiscourses he gave his pupils. Not one of them was more attentive than\r\nthe humble, unnoticed Woggle-Bug, and I acquired in this way a fund of\r\nknowledge that I will myself confess is simply marvelous. That is why I\r\nplace ‘T.E.’ Thoroughly Educated upon my cards; for my greatest pride\r\nlies in the fact that the world cannot produce another Woggle-Bug with\r\na tenth part of my own culture and erudition.”\r\n\r\n“I do not blame you,” said the Scarecrow. “Education is a thing to be\r\nproud of. I’m educated myself. The mess of brains given me by the Great\r\nWizard is considered by my friends to be unexcelled.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” interrupted the Tin Woodman, “a good heart is, I\r\nbelieve, much more desirable than education or brains.”\r\n\r\n“To me,” said the Saw-Horse, “a good leg is more desirable than\r\neither.”\r\n\r\n“Could seeds be considered in the light of brains?” enquired the\r\nPumpkinhead, abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Keep quiet!” commanded Tip, sternly.\r\n\r\n“Very well, dear father,” answered the obedient Jack.\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug listened patiently—even respectfully—to these remarks,\r\nand then resumed his story.\r\n\r\n“I must have lived fully three years in that secluded school-house\r\nhearth,” said he, “drinking thirstily of the ever-flowing fount of\r\nlimpid knowledge before me.”\r\n\r\n“Quite poetical,” commented the Scarecrow, nodding his head\r\napprovingly.\r\n\r\n“But one, day” continued the Bug, “a marvelous circumstance occurred\r\nthat altered my very existence and brought me to my present pinnacle of\r\ngreatness. The Professor discovered me in the act of crawling across\r\nthe hearth, and before I could escape he had caught me between his\r\nthumb and forefinger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image167]\r\n\r\n“‘My dear children,’ said he, ‘I have captured a Woggle-Bug—a very rare\r\nand interesting specimen. Do any of you know what a Woggle-Bug is?’\r\n\r\n“‘No!’ yelled the scholars, in chorus.\r\n\r\n“‘Then,’ said the Professor, ‘I will get out my famous magnifying-glass\r\nand throw the insect upon a screen in a highly-magnified condition,\r\nthat you may all study carefully its peculiar construction and become\r\nacquainted with its habits and manner of life.’\r\n\r\n“He then brought from a cupboard a most curious instrument, and before\r\nI could realize what had happened I found myself thrown upon a screen\r\nin a highly-magnified state—even as you now behold me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image169]\r\n\r\n“The students stood up on their stools and craned their heads forward\r\nto get a better view of me, and two little girls jumped upon the sill\r\nof an open window where they could see more plainly.\r\n\r\n“‘Behold!’ cried the Professor, in a loud voice, ‘this highly-magnified\r\nWoggle-Bug; one of the most curious insects in existence!’\r\n\r\n“Being Thoroughly Educated, and knowing what is required of a cultured\r\ngentleman, at this juncture I stood upright and, placing my hand upon\r\nmy bosom, made a very polite bow. My action, being unexpected, must\r\nhave startled them, for one of the little girls perched upon the\r\nwindow-sill gave a scream and fell backward out the window, drawing her\r\ncompanion with her as she disappeared.\r\n\r\n“The Professor uttered a cry of horror and rushed away through the door\r\nto see if the poor children were injured by the fall. The scholars\r\nfollowed after him in a wild mob, and I was left alone in the\r\nschool-room, still in a Highly-Magnified state and free to do as I\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n“It immediately occurred to me that this was a good opportunity to\r\nescape. I was proud of my great size, and realized that now I could\r\nsafely travel anywhere in the world, while my superior culture would\r\nmake me a fit associate for the most learned person I might chance to\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\n“So, while the Professor picked the little girls—who were more\r\nfrightened than hurt—off the ground, and the pupils clustered around\r\nhim closely grouped, I calmly walked out of the school-house, turned a\r\ncorner, and escaped unnoticed to a grove of trees that stood near”\r\n\r\n“Wonderful!” exclaimed the Pumpkinhead, admiringly.\r\n\r\n“It was, indeed,” agreed the Woggle-Bug. “I have never ceased to\r\ncongratulate myself for escaping while I was Highly Magnified; for even\r\nmy excessive knowledge would have proved of little use to me had I\r\nremained a tiny, insignificant insect.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image171]\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know before,” said Tip, looking at the Woggle-Bug with a\r\npuzzled expression, “that insects wore clothes.”\r\n\r\n“Nor do they, in their natural state,” returned the stranger. “But in\r\nthe course of my wanderings I had the good fortune to save the ninth\r\nlife of a tailor—tailors having, like cats, nine lives, as you probably\r\nknow. The fellow was exceedingly grateful, for had he lost that ninth\r\nlife it would have been the end of him; so he begged permission to\r\nfurnish me with the stylish costume I now wear. It fits very nicely,\r\ndoes it not?” and the Woggle-Bug stood up and turned himself around\r\nslowly, that all might examine his person.\r\n\r\n“He must have been a good tailor,” said the Scarecrow, somewhat\r\nenviously.\r\n\r\n“He was a good-hearted tailor, at any rate,” observed Nick Chopper.\r\n\r\n“But where were you going, when you met us?” Tip asked the Woggle-Bug.\r\n\r\n“Nowhere in particular,” was the reply, “although it is my intention\r\nsoon to visit the Emerald City and arrange to give a course of lectures\r\nto select audiences on the ‘Advantages of Magnification.’”\r\n\r\n“We are bound for the Emerald City now,” said the Tin Woodman; “so, if\r\nit pleases you to do so, you are welcome to travel in our company.”\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug bowed with profound grace.\r\n\r\n“It will give me great pleasure,” said he “to accept your kind\r\ninvitation; for nowhere in the Land of Oz could I hope to meet with so\r\ncongenial a company.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” acknowledged the Pumpkinhead. “We are quite as\r\ncongenial as flies and honey.”\r\n\r\n“But—pardon me if I seem inquisitive—are you not all rather—ahem!\r\nrather unusual?” asked the Woggle-Bug, looking from one to another with\r\nunconcealed interest.\r\n\r\n“Not more so than yourself,” answered the Scarecrow. “Everything in\r\nlife is unusual until you get accustomed to it.”\r\n\r\n“What rare philosophy!” exclaimed the Woggle-Bug, admiringly.\r\n\r\n“Yes; my brains are working well today,” admitted the Scarecrow, an\r\naccent of pride in his voice.\r\n\r\n“Then, if you are sufficiently rested and refreshed, let us bend our\r\nsteps toward the Emerald City,” suggested the magnified one.\r\n\r\n“We can’t,” said Tip. “The Saw-Horse has broken a leg, so he can’t bend\r\nhis steps. And there is no wood around to make him a new limb from. And\r\nwe can’t leave the horse behind because the Pumpkinhead is so stiff in\r\nhis Joints that he has to ride.”\r\n\r\n“How very unfortunate!” cried the Woggle-Bug. Then he looked the party\r\nover carefully and said:\r\n\r\n“If the Pumpkinhead is to ride, why not use one of his legs to make a\r\nleg for the horse that carries him? I judge that both are made of\r\nwood.”\r\n\r\n“Now, that is what I call real cleverness,” said the Scarecrow,\r\napprovingly. “I wonder my brains did not think of that long ago! Get to\r\nwork, my dear Nick, and fit the Pumpkinhead’s leg to the Saw-Horse.”\r\n\r\nJack was not especially pleased with this idea; but he submitted to\r\nhaving his left leg amputated by the Tin Woodman and whittled down to\r\nfit the left leg of the Saw-Horse. Nor was the Saw-Horse especially\r\npleased with the operation, either; for he growled a good deal about\r\nbeing “butchered,” as he called it, and afterward declared that the new\r\nleg was a disgrace to a respectable Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n“I beg you to be more careful in your speech,” said the Pumpkinhead,\r\nsharply. “Remember, if you please, that it is my leg you are abusing.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot forget it,” retorted the Saw-Horse, “for it is quite as\r\nflimsy as the rest of your person.”\r\n\r\n“Flimsy! me flimsy!” cried Jack, in a rage. “How dare you call me\r\nflimsy?”\r\n\r\n“Because you are built as absurdly as a jumping-jack,” sneered the\r\nhorse, rolling his knotty eyes in a vicious manner. “Even your head\r\nwon’t stay straight, and you never can tell whether you are looking\r\nbackwards or forwards!”\r\n\r\n“Friends, I entreat you not to quarrel!” pleaded the Tin Woodman,\r\nanxiously. “As a matter of fact, we are none of us above criticism; so\r\nlet us bear with each others’ faults.”\r\n\r\n“An excellent suggestion,” said the Woggle-Bug, approvingly. “You must\r\nhave an excellent heart, my metallic friend.”\r\n\r\n“I have,” returned Nick, well pleased. “My heart is quite the best part\r\nof me. But now let us start upon our Journey.\r\n\r\nThey perched the one-legged Pumpkinhead upon the Saw-Horse, and tied\r\nhim to his seat with cords, so that he could not possibly fall off.\r\n\r\nAnd then, following the lead of the Scarecrow, they all advanced in the\r\ndirection of the Emerald City.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image175]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image176]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image177]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Mombi indulges in Witchcraft\r\n\r\n\r\nThey soon discovered that the Saw-Horse limped, for his new leg was a\r\ntrifle too long. So they were obliged to halt while the Tin Woodman\r\nchopped it down with his axe, after which the wooden steed paced along\r\nmore comfortably. But the Saw-Horse was not entirely satisfied, even\r\nyet.\r\n\r\n“It was a shame that I broke my other leg!” it growled.\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” airily remarked the Woggle-Bug, who was walking\r\nalongside, “you should consider the accident most fortunate. For a\r\nhorse is never of much use until he has been broken.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” said Tip, rather provoked, for he felt a warm\r\ninterest in both the Saw-Horse and his man Jack; “but permit me to say\r\nthat your joke is a poor one, and as old as it is poor.”\r\n\r\n“Still, it is a Joke,” declared the Woggle-Bug; firmly, “and a Joke\r\nderived from a play upon words is considered among educated people to\r\nbe eminently proper.”\r\n\r\n“What does that mean?” enquired the Pumpkinhead, stupidly.\r\n\r\n“It means, my dear friend,” explained the Woggle-Bug, “that our\r\nlanguage contains many words having a double meaning; and that to\r\npronounce a joke that allows both meanings of a certain word, proves\r\nthe joker a person of culture and refinement, who has, moreover, a\r\nthorough command of the language.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe that,” said Tip, plainly; “anybody can make a pun.”\r\n\r\n“Not so,” rejoined the Woggle-Bug, stiffly. “It requires education of a\r\nhigh order. Are you educated, young sir?”\r\n\r\n“Not especially,” admitted Tip.\r\n\r\n“Then you cannot judge the matter. I myself am Thoroughly Educated, and\r\nI say that puns display genius. For instance, were I to ride upon this\r\nSaw-Horse, he would not only be an animal he would become an equipage.\r\nFor he would then be a horse-and-buggy.”\r\n\r\nAt this the Scarecrow gave a gasp and the Tin Woodman stopped short and\r\nlooked reproachfully at the Woggle-Bug. At the same time the Saw-Horse\r\nloudly snorted his derision; and even the Pumpkinhead put up his hand\r\nto hide the smile which, because it was carved upon his face, he could\r\nnot change to a frown.\r\n\r\nBut the Woggle-Bug strutted along as if he had made some brilliant\r\nremark, and the Scarecrow was obliged to say:\r\n\r\n“I have heard, my dear friend, that a person can become over-educated;\r\nand although I have a high respect for brains, no matter how they may\r\nbe arranged or classified, I begin to suspect that yours are slightly\r\ntangled. In any event, I must beg you to restrain your superior\r\neducation while in our society.”\r\n\r\n“We are not very particular,” added the Tin Woodman; “and we are\r\nexceedingly kind hearted. But if your superior culture gets leaky\r\nagain—” He did not complete the sentence, but he twirled his gleaming\r\naxe so carelessly that the Woggle-Bug looked frightened, and shrank\r\naway to a safe distance.\r\n\r\nThe others marched on in silence, and the Highly Magnified one, after a\r\nperiod of deep thought, said in an humble voice:\r\n\r\n“I will endeavor to restrain myself.”\r\n\r\n“That is all we can expect,” returned the Scarecrow pleasantly; and\r\ngood nature being thus happily restored to the party, they proceeded\r\nupon their way.\r\n\r\nWhen they again stopped to allow Tip to rest—the boy being the only one\r\nthat seemed to tire—the Tin Woodman noticed many small, round holes in\r\nthe grassy meadow.\r\n\r\n“This must be a village of the Field Mice,” he said to the Scarecrow.\r\n“I wonder if my old friend, the Queen of the Mice, is in this\r\nneighborhood.”\r\n\r\n“If she is, she may be of great service to us,” answered the Scarecrow,\r\nwho was impressed by a sudden thought. “See if you can call her, my\r\ndear Nick.”\r\n\r\nSo the Tin Woodman blew a shrill note upon a silver whistle that hung\r\naround his neck, and presently a tiny grey mouse popped from a near-by\r\nhole and advanced fearlessly toward them. For the Tin Woodman had once\r\nsaved her life, and the Queen of the Field Mice knew he was to be\r\ntrusted.\r\n\r\n“Good day, your Majesty,” said Nick, politely addressing the mouse; “I\r\ntrust you are enjoying good health?”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, I am quite well,” answered the Queen, demurely, as she sat\r\nup and displayed the tiny golden crown upon her head. “Can I do\r\nanything to assist my old friends?”\r\n\r\n“You can, indeed,” replied the Scarecrow, eagerly. “Let me, I intreat\r\nyou, take a dozen of your subjects with me to the Emerald City.”\r\n\r\n“Will they be injured in any way?” asked the Queen, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“I think not,” replied the Scarecrow. “I will carry them hidden in the\r\nstraw which stuffs my body, and when I give them the signal by\r\nunbuttoning my jacket, they have only to rush out and scamper home\r\nagain as fast as they can. By doing this they will assist me to regain\r\nmy throne, which the Army of Revolt has taken from me.”\r\n\r\n“In that case,” said the Queen, “I will not refuse your request.\r\nWhenever you are ready, I will call twelve of my most intelligent\r\nsubjects.”\r\n\r\n“I am ready now” returned the Scarecrow. Then he lay flat upon the\r\nground and unbuttoned his jacket, displaying the mass of straw with\r\nwhich he was stuffed.\r\n\r\nThe Queen uttered a little piping call, and in an instant a dozen\r\npretty field mice had emerged from their holes and stood before their\r\nruler, awaiting her orders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image181]\r\n\r\nWhat the Queen said to them none of our travelers could understand, for\r\nit was in the mouse language; but the field mice obeyed without\r\nhesitation, running one after the other to the Scarecrow and hiding\r\nthemselves in the straw of his breast.\r\n\r\nWhen all of the twelve mice had thus concealed themselves, the\r\nScarecrow buttoned his Jacket securely and then arose and thanked the\r\nQueen for her kindness.\r\n\r\n“One thing more you might do to serve us,” suggested the Tin Woodman;\r\n“and that is to run ahead and show us the way to the Emerald City. For\r\nsome enemy is evidently trying to prevent us from reaching it.”\r\n\r\n“I will do that gladly,” returned the Queen. “Are you ready?”\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman looked at Tip.\r\n\r\n“I’m rested,” said the boy. “Let us start.”\r\n\r\nThen they resumed their journey, the little grey Queen of the Field\r\nMice running swiftly ahead and then pausing until the travelers drew\r\nnear, when away she would dart again.\r\n\r\nWithout this unerring guide the Scarecrow and his comrades might never\r\nhave gained the Emerald City; for many were the obstacles thrown in\r\ntheir way by the arts of old Mombi. Yet not one of the obstacles really\r\nexisted—all were cleverly contrived deceptions. For when they came to\r\nthe banks of a rushing river that threatened to bar their way the\r\nlittle Queen kept steadily on, passing through the seeming flood in\r\nsafety; and our travelers followed her without encountering a single\r\ndrop of water.\r\n\r\nAgain, a high wall of granite towered high above their heads and\r\nopposed their advance. But the grey Field Mouse walked straight through\r\nit, and the others did the same, the wall melting into mist as they\r\npassed it.\r\n\r\nAfterward, when they had stopped for a moment to allow Tip to rest,\r\nthey saw forty roads branching off from their feet in forty different\r\ndirections; and soon these forty roads began whirling around like a\r\nmighty wheel, first in one direction and then in the other, completely\r\nbewildering their vision.\r\n\r\nBut the Queen called for them to follow her and darted off in a\r\nstraight line; and when they had gone a few paces the whirling pathways\r\nvanished and were seen no more.\r\n\r\nMombi’s last trick was the most fearful of all. She sent a sheet of\r\ncrackling flame rushing over the meadow to consume them; and for the\r\nfirst time the Scarecrow became afraid and turned to fly.\r\n\r\n“If that fire reaches me I will be gone in no time!” said he, trembling\r\nuntil his straw rattled. “It’s the most dangerous thing I ever\r\nencountered.”\r\n\r\n“I’m off, too!” cried the Saw-Horse, turning and prancing with\r\nagitation; “for my wood is so dry it would burn like kindlings.”\r\n\r\n“Is fire dangerous to pumpkins?” asked Jack, fearfully.\r\n\r\n“You’ll be baked like a tart—and so will I!” answered the Woggle-Bug,\r\ngetting down on all fours so he could run the faster.\r\n\r\nBut the Tin Woodman, having no fear of fire, averted the stampede by a\r\nfew sensible words.\r\n\r\n“Look at the Field Mouse!” he shouted. “The fire does not burn her in\r\nthe least. In fact, it is no fire at all, but only a deception.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, to watch the little Queen march calmly through the advancing\r\nflames restored courage to every member of the party, and they followed\r\nher without being even scorched.\r\n\r\n“This is surely a most extraordinary adventure,” said the Woggle-Bug,\r\nwho was greatly amazed; “for it upsets all the Natural Laws that I\r\nheard Professor Nowitall teach in the school-house.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it does,” said the Scarecrow, wisely. “All magic is\r\nunnatural, and for that reason is to be feared and avoided. But I see\r\nbefore us the gates of the Emerald City, so I imagine we have now\r\novercome all the magical obstacles that seemed to oppose us.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, the walls of the City were plainly visible, and the Queen of\r\nthe Field Mice, who had guided them so faithfully, came near to bid\r\nthem good-bye.\r\n\r\n“We are very grateful to your Majesty for your kind assistance,” said\r\nthe Tin Woodman, bowing before the pretty creature.\r\n\r\n“I am always pleased to be of service to my friends,” answered the\r\nQueen, and in a flash she had darted away upon her journey home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image188]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image189]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prisoners of the Queen\r\n\r\n\r\nApproaching the gateway of the Emerald City the travelers found it\r\nguarded by two girls of the Army of Revolt, who opposed their entrance\r\nby drawing the knitting-needles from their hair and threatening to prod\r\nthe first that came near.\r\n\r\nBut the Tin Woodman was not afraid.\r\n\r\n“At the worst they can but scratch my beautiful nickel-plate,” he said.\r\n“But there will be no ‘worst,’ for I think I can manage to frighten\r\nthese absurd soldiers very easily. Follow me closely, all of you!”\r\n\r\nThen, swinging his axe in a great circle to right and left before him,\r\nhe advanced upon the gate, and the others followed him without\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nThe girls, who had expected no resistance whatever, were terrified by\r\nthe sweep of the glittering axe and fled screaming into the city; so\r\nthat our travelers passed the gates in safety and marched down the\r\ngreen marble pavement of the wide street toward the royal palace.\r\n\r\n“At this rate we will soon have your Majesty upon the throne again,”\r\nsaid the Tin Woodman, laughing at his easy conquest of the guards.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, friend Nick,” returned the Scarecrow, gratefully. “Nothing\r\ncan resist your kind heart and your sharp axe.”\r\n\r\nAs they passed the rows of houses they saw through the open doors that\r\nmen were sweeping and dusting and washing dishes, while the women sat\r\naround in groups, gossiping and laughing.\r\n\r\n“What has happened?” the Scarecrow asked a sad-looking man with a bushy\r\nbeard, who wore an apron and was wheeling a baby-carriage along the\r\nsidewalk.\r\n\r\n“Why, we’ve had a revolution, your Majesty as you ought to know very\r\nwell,” replied the man; “and since you went away the women have been\r\nrunning things to suit themselves. I’m glad you have decided to come\r\nback and restore order, for doing housework and minding the children is\r\nwearing out the strength of every man in the Emerald City.”\r\n\r\n“Hm!” said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully. “If it is such hard work as you\r\nsay, how did the women manage it so easily?”\r\n\r\n“I really do not know” replied the man, with a deep sigh. “Perhaps the\r\nwomen are made of castiron.”\r\n\r\nNo movement was made, as they passed along the street, to oppose their\r\nprogress. Several of the women stopped their gossip long enough to cast\r\ncurious looks upon our friends, but immediately they would turn away\r\nwith a laugh or a sneer and resume their chatter. And when they met\r\nwith several girls belonging to the Army of Revolt, those soldiers,\r\ninstead of being alarmed or appearing surprised, merely stepped out of\r\nthe way and allowed them to advance without protest.\r\n\r\nThis action rendered the Scarecrow uneasy.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid we are walking into a trap,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” returned Nick Chopper, confidently; “the silly creatures\r\nare conquered already!”\r\n\r\nBut the Scarecrow shook his head in a way that expressed doubt, and Tip\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image192]\r\n\r\n“It’s too easy, altogether. Look out for trouble ahead.”\r\n\r\n“I will,” returned his Majesty. Unopposed they reached the royal palace\r\nand marched up the marble steps, which had once been thickly crusted\r\nwith emeralds but were now filled with tiny holes where the jewels had\r\nbeen ruthlessly torn from their settings by the Army of Revolt. And so\r\nfar not a rebel barred their way.\r\n\r\nThrough the arched hallways and into the magnificent throne room\r\nmarched the Tin Woodman and his followers, and here, when the green\r\nsilken curtains fell behind them, they saw a curious sight.\r\n\r\nSeated within the glittering throne was General Jinjur, with the\r\nScarecrow’s second-best crown upon her head, and the royal sceptre in\r\nher right hand. A box of caramels, from which she was eating, rested in\r\nher lap, and the girl seemed entirely at ease in her royal\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow stepped forward and confronted her, while the Tin Woodman\r\nleaned upon his axe and the others formed a half-circle back of his\r\nMajesty’s person.\r\n\r\n“How dare you sit in my throne?” demanded the Scarecrow, sternly eyeing\r\nthe intruder. “Don’t you know you are guilty of treason, and that there\r\nis a law against treason?”\r\n\r\n“The throne belongs to whoever is able to take it,” answered Jinjur, as\r\nshe slowly ate another caramel. “I have taken it, as you see; so just\r\nnow I am the Queen, and all who oppose me are guilty of treason, and\r\nmust be punished by the law you have just mentioned.”\r\n\r\nThis view of the case puzzled the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“How is it, friend Nick?” he asked, turning to the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n“Why, when it comes to Law, I have nothing to, say” answered that\r\npersonage. “for laws were never meant to be understood, and it is\r\nfoolish to make the attempt.”\r\n\r\n“Then what shall we do?” asked the Scarecrow, in dismay.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you marry the Queen? And then you can both rule,” suggested\r\nthe Woggle-Bug.\r\n\r\nJinjur glared at the insect fiercely. “Why don’t you send her back to\r\nher mother, where she belongs?” asked Jack Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\nJinjur frowned.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you shut her up in a closet until she behaves herself, and\r\npromises to be good?” enquired Tip. Jinjur’s lip curled scornfully.\r\n\r\n“Or give her a good shaking!” added the Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n“No,” said the Tin Woodman, “we must treat the poor girl with\r\ngentleness. Let us give her all the Jewels she can carry, and send her\r\naway happy and contented.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image195]\r\n\r\nAt this Queen Jinjur laughed aloud, and the next minute clapped her\r\npretty hands together thrice, as if for a signal.\r\n\r\n“You are very absurd creatures,” said she; “but I am tired of your\r\nnonsense and have no time to bother with you longer.”\r\n\r\nWhile the monarch and his friends listened in amazement to this\r\nimpudent speech, a startling thing happened. The Tin Woodman’s axe was\r\nsnatched from his grasp by some person behind him, and he found himself\r\ndisarmed and helpless. At the same instant a shout of laughter rang in\r\nthe ears of the devoted band, and turning to see whence this came they\r\nfound themselves surrounded by the Army of Revolt, the girls bearing in\r\neither hand their glistening knitting-needles. The entire throne room\r\nseemed to be filled with the rebels, and the Scarecrow and his comrades\r\nrealized that they were prisoners.\r\n\r\n“You see how foolish it is to oppose a woman’s wit,” said Jinjur,\r\ngaily; “and this event only proves that I am more fit to rule the\r\nEmerald City than a Scarecrow. I bear you no ill will, I assure you;\r\nbut lest you should prove troublesome to me in the future I shall order\r\nyou all to be destroyed. That is, all except the boy, who belongs to\r\nold Mombi and must be restored to her keeping. The rest of you are not\r\nhuman, and therefore it will not be wicked to demolish you. The\r\nSaw-Horse and the Pumpkinhead’s body I will have chopped up for\r\nkindling-wood; and the pumpkin shall be made into tarts. The Scarecrow\r\nwill do nicely to start a bonfire, and the tin man can be cut into\r\nsmall pieces and fed to the goats. As for this immense Woggle-Bug—”\r\n\r\n“Highly Magnified, if you please!” interrupted the insect.\r\n\r\n“I think I will ask the cook to make green-turtle soup of you,”\r\ncontinued the Queen, reflectively.\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug shuddered.\r\n\r\n“Or, if that won’t do, we might use you for a Hungarian goulash, stewed\r\nand highly spiced,” she added, cruelly.\r\n\r\nThis programme of extermination was so terrible that the prisoners\r\nlooked upon one another in a panic of fear. The Scarecrow alone did not\r\ngive way to despair. He stood quietly before the Queen and his brow was\r\nwrinkled in deep thought as he strove to find some means to escape.\r\n\r\nWhile thus engaged he felt the straw within his breast move gently. At\r\nonce his expression changed from sadness to joy, and raising his hand\r\nhe quickly unbuttoned the front of his jacket.\r\n\r\nThis action did not pass unnoticed by the crowd of girls clustering\r\nabout him, but none of them suspected what he was doing until a tiny\r\ngrey mouse leaped from his bosom to the floor and scampered away\r\nbetween the feet of the Army of Revolt. Another mouse quickly followed;\r\nthen another and another, in rapid succession. And suddenly such a\r\nscream of terror went up from the Army that it might easily have filled\r\nthe stoutest heart with consternation. The flight that ensued turned to\r\na stampede, and the stampede to a panic.\r\n\r\nFor while the startled mice rushed wildly about the room the Scarecrow\r\nhad only time to note a whirl of skirts and a twinkling of feet as the\r\ngirls disappeared from the palace—pushing and crowding one another in\r\ntheir mad efforts to escape.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, at the first alarm, stood up on the cushions of the throne\r\nand began to dance frantically upon her tiptoes. Then a mouse ran up\r\nthe cushions, and with a terrified leap poor Jinjur shot clear over the\r\nhead of the Scarecrow and escaped through an archway—never pausing in\r\nher wild career until she had reached the city gates.\r\n\r\nSo, in less time than I can explain, the throne room was deserted by\r\nall save the Scarecrow and his friends, and the Woggle-Bug heaved a\r\ndeep sigh of relief as he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Thank goodness, we are saved!”\r\n\r\n“For a time, yes;” answered the Tin Woodman. “But the enemy will soon\r\nreturn, I fear.”\r\n\r\n“Let us bar all the entrances to the palace!” said the Scarecrow. “Then\r\nwe shall have time to think what is best to be done.”\r\n\r\nSo all except Jack Pumpkinhead, who was still tied fast to the\r\nSaw-Horse, ran to the various entrances of the royal palace and closed\r\nthe heavy doors, bolting and locking them securely. Then, knowing that\r\nthe Army of Revolt could not batter down the barriers in several days,\r\nthe adventurers gathered once more in the throne room for a council of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image201]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image202]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image203]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow Takes Time to Think\r\n\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” began the Scarecrow, when all were again assembled in\r\nthe throne room, “that the girl Jinjur is quite right in claiming to be\r\nQueen. And if she is right, then I am wrong, and we have no business to\r\nbe occupying her palace.”\r\n\r\n“But you were the King until she came,” said the Woggle-Bug, strutting\r\nup and down with his hands in his pockets; “so it appears to me that\r\nshe is the interloper instead of you.”\r\n\r\n“Especially as we have just conquered her and put her to flight,” added\r\nthe Pumpkinhead, as he raised his hands to turn his face toward the\r\nScarecrow.\r\n\r\n“Have we really conquered her?” asked the Scarecrow, quietly. “Look out\r\nof the window, and tell me what you see.”\r\n\r\nTip ran to the window and looked out.\r\n\r\n“The palace is surrounded by a double row of girl soldiers,” he\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n“I thought so,” returned the Scarecrow. “We are as truly their\r\nprisoners as we were before the mice frightened them from the palace.”\r\n\r\n“My friend is right,” said Nick Chopper, who had been polishing his\r\nbreast with a bit of chamois-leather. “Jinjur is still the Queen, and\r\nwe are her prisoners.”\r\n\r\n“But I hope she cannot get at us,” exclaimed the Pumpkinhead, with a\r\nshiver of fear. “She threatened to make tarts of me, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry,” said the Tin Woodman. “It cannot matter greatly. If you\r\nstay shut up here you will spoil in time, anyway. A good tart is far\r\nmore admirable than a decayed intellect.”\r\n\r\n“Very true,” agreed the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear!” moaned Jack; “what an unhappy lot is mine! Why, dear\r\nfather, did you not make me out of tin—or even out of straw—so that I\r\nwould keep indefinitely.”\r\n\r\n“Shucks!” returned Tip, indignantly. “You ought to be glad that I made\r\nyou at all.” Then he added, reflectively, “everything has to come to an\r\nend, some time.”\r\n\r\n“But I beg to remind you,” broke in the Woggle-Bug, who had a\r\ndistressed look in his bulging, round eyes, “that this terrible Queen\r\nJinjur suggested making a goulash of me—Me! the only Highly Magnified\r\nand Thoroughly Educated Woggle-Bug in the wide, wide world!”\r\n\r\n“I think it was a brilliant idea,” remarked the Scarecrow, approvingly.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you imagine he would make a better soup?” asked the Tin Woodman,\r\nturning toward his friend.\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps,” acknowledged the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug groaned.\r\n\r\n“I can see, in my mind’s eye,” said he, mournfully, “the goats eating\r\nsmall pieces of my dear comrade, the Tin Woodman, while my soup is\r\nbeing cooked on a bonfire built of the Saw-Horse and Jack Pumpkinhead’s\r\nbody, and Queen Jinjur watches me boil while she feeds the flames with\r\nmy friend the Scarecrow!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image205]\r\n\r\nThis morbid picture cast a gloom over the entire party, making them\r\nrestless and anxious.\r\n\r\n“It can’t happen for some time,” said the Tin Woodman, trying to speak\r\ncheerfully; “for we shall be able to keep Jinjur out of the palace\r\nuntil she manages to break down the doors.”\r\n\r\n“And in the meantime I am liable to starve to death, and so is the\r\nWoggle-Bug,” announced Tip.\r\n\r\n“As for me,” said the Woggle-Bug, “I think that I could live for some\r\ntime on Jack Pumpkinhead. Not that I prefer pumpkins for food; but I\r\nbelieve they are somewhat nutritious, and Jack’s head is large and\r\nplump.”\r\n\r\n“How heartless!” exclaimed the Tin Woodman, greatly shocked. “Are we\r\ncannibals, let me ask? Or are we faithful friends?”\r\n\r\n“I see very clearly that we cannot stay shut up in this palace,” said\r\nthe Scarecrow, with decision. “So let us end this mournful talk and try\r\nto discover a means to escape.”\r\n\r\nAt this suggestion they all gathered eagerly around the throne, wherein\r\nwas seated the Scarecrow, and as Tip sat down upon a stool there fell\r\nfrom his pocket a pepper-box, which rolled upon the floor.\r\n\r\n“What is this?” asked Nick Chopper, picking up the box.\r\n\r\n“Be careful!” cried the boy. “That’s my Powder of Life. Don’t spill it,\r\nfor it is nearly gone.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the Powder of Life?” enquired the Scarecrow, as Tip\r\nreplaced the box carefully in his pocket.\r\n\r\n“It’s some magical stuff old Mombi got from a crooked sorcerer,”\r\nexplained the boy. “She brought Jack to life with it, and afterward I\r\nused it to bring the Saw-Horse to life. I guess it will make anything\r\nlive that is sprinkled with it; but there’s only about one dose left.”\r\n\r\n“Then it is very precious,” said the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n“Indeed it is,” agreed the Scarecrow. “It may prove our best means of\r\nescape from our difficulties. I believe I will think for a few minutes;\r\nso I will thank you, friend Tip, to get out your knife and rip this\r\nheavy crown from my forehead.”\r\n\r\nTip soon cut the stitches that had fastened the crown to the\r\nScarecrow’s head, and the former monarch of the Emerald City removed it\r\nwith a sigh of relief and hung it on a peg beside the throne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image209]\r\n\r\n“That is my last memento of royalty” said he; “and I’m glad to get rid\r\nof it. The former King of this City, who was named Pastoria, lost the\r\ncrown to the Wonderful Wizard, who passed it on to me. Now the girl\r\nJinjur claims it, and I sincerely hope it will not give her a\r\nheadache.”\r\n\r\n“A kindly thought, which I greatly admire,” said the Tin Woodman,\r\nnodding approvingly.\r\n\r\n“And now I will indulge in a quiet think,” continued the Scarecrow,\r\nlying back in the throne.\r\n\r\nThe others remained as silent and still as possible, so as not to\r\ndisturb him; for all had great confidence in the extraordinary brains\r\nof the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\nAnd, after what seemed a very long time indeed to the anxious watchers,\r\nthe thinker sat up, looked upon his friends with his most whimsical\r\nexpression, and said:\r\n\r\n“My brains work beautifully today. I’m quite proud of them. Now,\r\nlisten! If we attempt to escape through the doors of the palace we\r\nshall surely be captured. And, as we can’t escape through the ground,\r\nthere is only one other thing to be done. We must escape through the\r\nair!”\r\n\r\nHe paused to note the effect of these words; but all his hearers seemed\r\npuzzled and unconvinced.\r\n\r\n“The Wonderful Wizard escaped in a balloon,” he continued. “We don’t\r\nknow how to make a balloon, of course; but any sort of thing that can\r\nfly through the air can carry us easily. So I suggest that my friend\r\nthe Tin Woodman, who is a skillful mechanic, shall build some sort of a\r\nmachine, with good strong wings, to carry us; and our friend Tip can\r\nthen bring the Thing to life with his magical powder.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” cried Nick Chopper.\r\n\r\n“What splendid brains!” murmured Jack.\r\n\r\n“Really quite clever!” said the Educated Woggle-Bug.\r\n\r\n“I believe it can be done,” declared Tip; “that is, if the Tin Woodman\r\nis equal to making the Thing.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll do my best,” said Nick, cheerily; “and, as a matter of fact, I do\r\nnot often fail in what I attempt. But the Thing will have to be built\r\non the roof of the palace, so it can rise comfortably into the air.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image211]\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“Then let us search through the palace,” continued the Tin Woodman,\r\n“and carry all the material we can find to the roof, where I will begin\r\nmy work.”\r\n\r\n“First, however,” said the Pumpkinhead, “I beg you will release me from\r\nthis horse, and make me another leg to walk with. For in my present\r\ncondition I am of no use to myself or to anyone else.”\r\n\r\nSo the Tin Woodman knocked a mahogany center-table to pieces with his\r\naxe and fitted one of the legs, which was beautifully carved, on to the\r\nbody of Jack Pumpkinhead, who was very proud of the acquisition.\r\n\r\n“It seems strange,” said he, as he watched the Tin Woodman work, “that\r\nmy left leg should be the most elegant and substantial part of me.”\r\n\r\n“That proves you are unusual,” returned the Scarecrow. “and I am\r\nconvinced that the only people worthy of consideration in this world\r\nare the unusual ones. For the common folks are like the leaves of a\r\ntree, and live and die unnoticed.”\r\n\r\n“Spoken like a philosopher!” cried the Woggle-Bug, as he assisted the\r\nTin Woodman to set Jack upon his feet.\r\n\r\n“How do you feel now?” asked Tip, watching the Pumpkinhead stump around\r\nto try his new leg.\r\n\r\n“As good as new” answered Jack, joyfully, “and quite ready to assist\r\nyou all to escape.”\r\n\r\n“Then let us get to work,” said the Scarecrow, in a business-like tone.\r\n\r\nSo, glad to be doing anything that might lead to the end of their\r\ncaptivity, the friends separated to wander over the palace in search of\r\nfitting material to use in the construction of their aerial machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image213]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image214]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image215]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Astonishing Flight of the Gump\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the adventurers reassembled upon the roof it was found that a\r\nremarkably queer assortment of articles had been selected by the\r\nvarious members of the party. No one seemed to have a very clear idea\r\nof what was required, but all had brought something.\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug had taken from its position over the mantle-piece in the\r\ngreat hallway the head of a Gump, which was adorned with wide-spreading\r\nantlers; and this, with great care and greater difficulty, the insect\r\nhad carried up the stairs to the roof. This Gump resembled an Elk’s\r\nhead, only the nose turned upward in a saucy manner and there were\r\nwhiskers upon its chin, like those of a billy-goat. Why the Woggle-Bug\r\nselected this article he could not have explained, except that it had\r\naroused his curiosity.\r\n\r\nTip, with the aid of the Saw-Horse, had brought a large, upholstered\r\nsofa to the roof. It was an oldfashioned piece of furniture, with high\r\nback and ends, and it was so heavy that even by resting the greatest\r\nweight upon the back of the Saw-Horse, the boy found himself out of\r\nbreath when at last the clumsy sofa was dumped upon the roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image217]\r\n\r\nThe Pumpkinhead had brought a broom, which was the first thing he saw.\r\nThe Scarecrow arrived with a coil of clothes-lines and ropes which he\r\nhad taken from the courtyard, and in his trip up the stairs he had\r\nbecome so entangled in the loose ends of the ropes that both he and his\r\nburden tumbled in a heap upon the roof and might have rolled off if Tip\r\nhad not rescued him.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman appeared last. He also had been to the courtyard, where\r\nhe had cut four great, spreading leaves from a huge palm-tree that was\r\nthe pride of all the inhabitants of the Emerald City.\r\n\r\n“My dear Nick!” exclaimed the Scarecrow, seeing what his friend had\r\ndone; “you have been guilty of the greatest crime any person can commit\r\nin the Emerald City. If I remember rightly, the penalty for chopping\r\nleaves from the royal palm-tree is to be killed seven times and\r\nafterward imprisoned for life.”\r\n\r\n“It cannot be helped now” answered the Tin Woodman, throwing down the\r\nbig leaves upon the roof. “But it may be one more reason why it is\r\nnecessary for us to escape. And now let us see what you have found for\r\nme to work with.”\r\n\r\nMany were the doubtful looks cast upon the heap of miscellaneous\r\nmaterial that now cluttered the roof, and finally the Scarecrow shook\r\nhis head and remarked:\r\n\r\n“Well, if friend Nick can manufacture, from this mess of rubbish, a\r\nThing that will fly through the air and carry us to safety, then I will\r\nacknowledge him to be a better mechanic than I suspected.”\r\n\r\nBut the Tin Woodman seemed at first by no means sure of his powers, and\r\nonly after polishing his forehead vigorously with the chamois-leather\r\ndid he resolve to undertake the task.\r\n\r\n“The first thing required for the machine,” said he, “is a body big\r\nenough to carry the entire party. This sofa is the biggest thing we\r\nhave, and might be used for a body. But, should the machine ever tip\r\nsideways, we would all slide off and fall to the ground.”\r\n\r\n“Why not use two sofas?” asked Tip. “There’s another one just like this\r\ndown stairs.”\r\n\r\n“That is a very sensible suggestion,” exclaimed the Tin Woodman. “You\r\nmust fetch the other sofa at once.”\r\n\r\nSo Tip and the Saw-Horse managed, with much labor, to get the second\r\nsofa to the roof; and when the two were placed together, edge to edge,\r\nthe backs and ends formed a protecting rampart all around the seats.\r\n\r\n“Excellent!” cried the Scarecrow. “We can ride within this snug nest\r\nquite at our ease.”\r\n\r\nThe two sofas were now bound firmly together with ropes and\r\nclothes-lines, and then Nick Chopper fastened the Gump’s head to one\r\nend.\r\n\r\n“That will show which is the front end of the Thing,” said he, greatly\r\npleased with the idea. “And, really, if you examine it critically, the\r\nGump looks very well as a figure-head. These great palm-leaves, for\r\nwhich I have endangered my life seven times, must serve us as wings.”\r\n\r\n“Are they strong enough?” asked the boy.\r\n\r\n“They are as strong as anything we can get,” answered the Woodman; “and\r\nalthough they are not in proportion to the Thing’s body, we are not in\r\na position to be very particular.”\r\n\r\nSo he fastened the palm-leaves to the sofas, two on each side.\r\n\r\nSaid the Woggle-Bug, with considerable admiration:\r\n\r\n“The Thing is now complete, and only needs to be brought to life.”\r\n\r\n“Stop a moment!” exclaimed Jack. “Are you not going to use my broom?”\r\n\r\n“What for?” asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“Why, it can be fastened to the back end for a tail,” answered the\r\nPumpkinhead. “Surely you would not call the Thing complete without a\r\ntail.”\r\n\r\n“Hm!” said the Tin Woodman, “I do not see the use of a tail. We are not\r\ntrying to copy a beast, or a fish, or a bird. All we ask of the Thing\r\nis to carry us through the air.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps, after the Thing is brought to life, it can use a tail to\r\nsteer with,” suggested the Scarecrow. “For if it flies through the air\r\nit will not be unlike a bird, and I’ve noticed that all birds have\r\ntails, which they use for a rudder while flying.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” answered Nick, “the broom shall be used for a tail,” and\r\nhe fastened it firmly to the back end of the sofa body.\r\n\r\nTip took the pepper-box from his pocket.\r\n\r\n“The Thing looks very big,” said he, anxiously; “and I am not sure\r\nthere is enough powder left to bring all of it to life. But I’ll make\r\nit go as far as possible.”\r\n\r\n“Put most on the wings,” said Nick Chopper; “for they must be made as\r\nstrong as possible.”\r\n\r\n“And don’t forget the head!” exclaimed the Woggle-Bug.\r\n\r\n“Or the tail!” added Jack Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n“Do be quiet,” said Tip, nervously; “you must give me a chance to work\r\nthe magic charm in the proper manner.”\r\n\r\nVery carefully he began sprinkling the Thing with the precious powder.\r\nEach of the four wings was first lightly covered with a layer, then the\r\nsofas were sprinkled, and the broom given a slight coating.\r\n\r\n“The head! The head! Don’t, I beg of you, forget the head!” cried the\r\nWoggle-Bug, excitedly.\r\n\r\n“There’s only a little of the powder left,” announced Tip, looking\r\nwithin the box. “And it seems to me it is more important to bring the\r\nlegs of the sofas to life than the head.”\r\n\r\n“Not so,” decided the Scarecrow. “Every thing must have a head to\r\ndirect it; and since this creature is to fly, and not walk, it is\r\nreally unimportant whether its legs are alive or not.”\r\n\r\nSo Tip abided by this decision and sprinkled the Gump’s head with the\r\nremainder of the powder.\r\n\r\n“Now” said he, “keep silence while I work the, charm!”\r\n\r\nHaving heard old Mombi pronounce the magic words, and having also\r\nsucceeded in bringing the Saw-Horse to life, Tip did not hesitate an\r\ninstant in speaking the three cabalistic words, each accompanied by the\r\npeculiar gesture of the hands.\r\n\r\nIt was a grave and impressive ceremony.\r\n\r\nAs he finished the incantation the Thing shuddered throughout its huge\r\nbulk, the Gump gave the screeching cry that is familiar to those\r\nanimals, and then the four wings began flopping furiously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image222]\r\n\r\nTip managed to grasp a chimney, else he would have been blown off the\r\nroof by the terrible breeze raised by the wings. The Scarecrow, being\r\nlight in weight, was caught up bodily and borne through the air until\r\nTip luckily seized him by one leg and held him fast. The Woggle-Bug lay\r\nflat upon the roof and so escaped harm, and the Tin Woodman, whose\r\nweight of tin anchored him firmly, threw both arms around Jack\r\nPumpkinhead and managed to save him. The Saw-Horse toppled over upon\r\nhis back and lay with his legs waving helplessly above him.\r\n\r\nAnd now, while all were struggling to recover themselves, the Thing\r\nrose slowly from the roof and mounted into the air.\r\n\r\n“Here! Come back!” cried Tip, in a frightened voice, as he clung to the\r\nchimney with one hand and the Scarecrow with the other. “Come back at\r\nonce, I command you!”\r\n\r\nIt was now that the wisdom of the Scarecrow, in bringing the head of\r\nthe Thing to life instead of the legs, was proved beyond a doubt. For\r\nthe Gump, already high in the air, turned its head at Tip’s command and\r\ngradually circled around until it could view the roof of the palace.\r\n\r\n“Come back!” shouted the boy, again.\r\n\r\nAnd the Gump obeyed, slowly and gracefully waving its four wings in the\r\nair until the Thing had settled once more upon the roof and become\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image224]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image225]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Jackdaw’s Nest\r\n\r\n\r\n“This,” said the Gump, in a squeaky voice not at all proportioned to\r\nthe size of its great body, “is the most novel experience I ever heard\r\nof. The last thing I remember distinctly is walking through the forest\r\nand hearing a loud noise. Something probably killed me then, and it\r\ncertainly ought to have been the end of me. Yet here I am, alive again,\r\nwith four monstrous wings and a body which I venture to say would make\r\nany respectable animal or fowl weep with shame to own. What does it all\r\nmean? Am I a Gump, or am I a juggernaut?” The creature, as it spoke,\r\nwiggled its chin whiskers in a very comical manner.\r\n\r\n“You’re just a Thing,” answered Tip, “with a Gump’s head on it. And we\r\nhave made you and brought you to life so that you may carry us through\r\nthe air wherever we wish to go.”\r\n\r\n“Very good!” said the Thing. “As I am not a Gump, I cannot have a\r\nGump’s pride or independent spirit. So I may as well become your\r\nservant as anything else. My only satisfaction is that I do not seem to\r\nhave a very strong constitution, and am not likely to live long in a\r\nstate of slavery.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t say that, I beg of you!” cried the Tin Woodman, whose excellent\r\nheart was strongly affected by this sad speech. “Are you not feeling\r\nwell today?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, as for that,” returned the Gump, “it is my first day of existence;\r\nso I cannot Judge whether I am feeling well or ill.” And it waved its\r\nbroom tail to and fro in a pensive manner.\r\n\r\n“Come, come!” said the Scarecrow, kindly. “do try, to be more cheerful\r\nand take life as you find it. We shall be kind masters, and will strive\r\nto render your existence as pleasant as possible. Are you willing to\r\ncarry us through the air wherever we wish to go?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” answered the Gump. “I greatly prefer to navigate the air.\r\nFor should I travel on the earth and meet with one of my own species,\r\nmy embarrassment would be something awful!”\r\n\r\n“I can appreciate that,” said the Tin Woodman, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” continued the Thing, “when I carefully look you over, my\r\nmasters, none of you seems to be constructed much more artistically\r\nthan I am.”\r\n\r\n“Appearances are deceitful,” said the Woggle-Bug, earnestly. “I am both\r\nHighly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” murmured the Gump, indifferently.\r\n\r\n“And my brains are considered remarkably rare specimens,” added the\r\nScarecrow, proudly.\r\n\r\n“How strange!” remarked the Gump.\r\n\r\n“Although I am of tin,” said the Woodman, “I own a heart altogether the\r\nwarmest and most admirable in the whole world.”\r\n\r\n“I’m delighted to hear it,” replied the Gump, with a slight cough.\r\n\r\n“My smile,” said Jack Pumpkinhead, “is worthy your best attention. It\r\nis always the same.”\r\n\r\n“_Semper idem_,” explained the Woggle-Bug, pompously; and the Gump\r\nturned to stare at him.\r\n\r\n“And I,” declared the Saw-Horse, filling in an awkward pause, “am only\r\nremarkable because I can’t help it.”\r\n\r\n“I am proud, indeed, to meet with such exceptional masters,” said the\r\nGump, in a careless tone. “If I could but secure so complete an\r\nintroduction to myself, I would be more than satisfied.”\r\n\r\n“That will come in time,” remarked the Scarecrow. “To ‘Know Thyself’ is\r\nconsidered quite an accomplishment, which it has taken us, who are your\r\nelders, months to perfect. But now,” he added, turning to the others,\r\n“let us get aboard and start upon our journey.”\r\n\r\n“Where shall we go?” asked Tip, as he clambered to a seat on the sofas\r\nand assisted the Pumpkinhead to follow him.\r\n\r\n“In the South Country rules a very delightful Queen called Glinda the\r\nGood, who I am sure will gladly receive us,” said the Scarecrow,\r\ngetting into the Thing clumsily. “Let us go to her and ask her advice.”\r\n\r\n“That is cleverly thought of,” declared Nick Chopper, giving the\r\nWoggle-Bug a boost and then toppling the Saw-Horse into the rear end of\r\nthe cushioned seats. “I know Glinda the Good, and believe she will\r\nprove a friend indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Are we all ready?” asked the boy.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” announced the Tin Woodman, seating himself beside the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Tip, addressing the Gump, “be kind enough to fly with us\r\nto the Southward; and do not go higher than to escape the houses and\r\ntrees, for it makes me dizzy to be up so far.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” answered the Gump, briefly.\r\n\r\nIt flopped its four huge wings and rose slowly into the air; and then,\r\nwhile our little band of adventurers clung to the backs and sides of\r\nthe sofas for support, the Gump turned toward the South and soared\r\nswiftly and majestically away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image229]\r\n\r\n“The scenic effect, from this altitude, is marvelous,” commented the\r\neducated Woggle-Bug, as they rode along.\r\n\r\n“Never mind the scenery,” said the Scarecrow. “Hold on tight, or you\r\nmay get a tumble. The Thing seems to rock badly.”\r\n\r\n“It will be dark soon,” said Tip, observing that the sun was low on the\r\nhorizon. “Perhaps we should have waited until morning. I wonder if the\r\nGump can fly in the night.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been wondering that myself,” returned the Gump quietly. “You see,\r\nthis is a new experience to me. I used to have legs that carried me\r\nswiftly over the ground. But now my legs feel as if they were asleep.”\r\n\r\n“They are,” said Tip. “We didn’t bring ’em to life.”\r\n\r\n“You’re expected to fly,” explained the Scarecrow. “not to walk.”\r\n\r\n“We can walk ourselves,” said the Woggle-Bug.\r\n\r\n“I begin to understand what is required of me,” remarked the Gump; “so\r\nI will do my best to please you,” and he flew on for a time in silence.\r\n\r\nPresently Jack Pumpkinhead became uneasy.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if riding through the air is liable to spoil pumpkins,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Not unless you carelessly drop your head over the side,” answered the\r\nWoggle-Bug. “In that event your head would no longer be a pumpkin, for\r\nit would become a squash.”\r\n\r\n“Have I not asked you to restrain these unfeeling jokes?” demanded Tip,\r\nlooking at the Woggle-Bug with a severe expression.\r\n\r\n“You have; and I’ve restrained a good many of them,” replied the\r\ninsect. “But there are opportunities for so many excellent puns in our\r\nlanguage that, to an educated person like myself, the temptation to\r\nexpress them is almost irresistible.”\r\n\r\n“People with more or less education discovered those puns centuries\r\nago,” said Tip.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure?” asked the Woggle-Bug, with a startled look.\r\n\r\n“Of course I am,” answered the boy. “An educated Woggle-Bug may be a\r\nnew thing; but a Woggle-Bug education is as old as the hills, judging\r\nfrom the display you make of it.”\r\n\r\nThe insect seemed much impressed by this remark, and for a time\r\nmaintained a meek silence.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow, in shifting his seat, saw upon the cushions the\r\npepper-box which Tip had cast aside, and began to examine it.\r\n\r\n“Throw it overboard,” said the boy; “it’s quite empty now, and there’s\r\nno use keeping it.”\r\n\r\n“Is it really empty?” asked the Scarecrow, looking curiously into the\r\nbox.\r\n\r\n“Of course it is,” answered Tip. “I shook out every grain of the\r\npowder.”\r\n\r\n“Then the box has two bottoms,” announced the Scarecrow, “for the\r\nbottom on the inside is fully an inch away from the bottom on the\r\noutside.”\r\n\r\n“Let me see,” said the Tin Woodman, taking the box from his friend.\r\n“Yes,” he declared, after looking it over, “the thing certainly has a\r\nfalse bottom. Now, I wonder what that is for?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you get it apart, and find out?” enquired Tip, now quite\r\ninterested in the mystery.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes; the lower bottom unscrews,” said the Tin Woodman. “My\r\nfingers are rather stiff; please see if you can open it.”\r\n\r\nHe handed the pepper-box to Tip, who had no difficulty in unscrewing\r\nthe bottom. And in the cavity below were three silver pills, with a\r\ncarefully folded paper lying underneath them.\r\n\r\nThis paper the boy proceeded to unfold, taking care not to spill the\r\npills, and found several lines clearly written in red ink.\r\n\r\n“Read it aloud,” said the Scarecrow. so Tip read, as follows:\r\n\r\n“DR. NIKIDIK’S CELEBRATED WISHING PILLS.\r\n\r\n“_Directions for Use:_ Swallow one pill; count seventeen by twos; then\r\nmake a Wish. The Wish will immediately be granted.\r\n\r\nCAUTION: Keep in a Dry and Dark Place.”\r\n\r\n“Why, this is a very valuable discovery!” cried the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“It is, indeed,” replied Tip, gravely. “These pills may be of great use\r\nto us. I wonder if old Mombi knew they were in the bottom of the\r\npepper-box. I remember hearing her say that she got the Powder of Life\r\nfrom this same Nikidik.”\r\n\r\n“He must be a powerful Sorcerer!” exclaimed the Tin Woodman; “and since\r\nthe powder proved a success we ought to have confidence in the pills.”\r\n\r\n“But how,” asked the Scarecrow, “can anyone count seventeen by twos?\r\nSeventeen is an odd number.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” replied Tip, greatly disappointed. “No one can possibly\r\ncount seventeen by twos.”\r\n\r\n“Then the pills are of no use to us,” wailed the Pumpkinhead; “and this\r\nfact overwhelms me with grief. For I had intended wishing that my head\r\nwould never spoil.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” said the Scarecrow, sharply. “If we could use the pills at\r\nall we would make far better wishes than that.”\r\n\r\n“I do not see how anything could be better,” protested poor Jack. “If\r\nyou were liable to spoil at any time you could understand my anxiety.”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said the Tin Woodman, “I sympathize with you in every\r\nrespect. But since we cannot count seventeen by twos, sympathy is all\r\nyou are liable to get.”\r\n\r\nBy this time it had become quite dark, and the voyagers found above\r\nthem a cloudy sky, through which the rays of the moon could not\r\npenetrate.\r\n\r\nThe Gump flew steadily on, and for some reason the huge sofa-body\r\nrocked more and more dizzily every hour.\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug declared he was sea-sick; and Tip was also pale and\r\nsomewhat distressed. But the others clung to the backs of the sofas and\r\ndid not seem to mind the motion as long as they were not tipped out.\r\n\r\nDarker and darker grew the night, and on and on sped the Gump through\r\nthe black heavens. The travelers could not even see one another, and an\r\noppressive silence settled down upon them.\r\n\r\nAfter a long time Tip, who had been thinking deeply, spoke.\r\n\r\n“How are we to know when we come to the pallace of Glinda the Good?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“It’s a long way to Glinda’s palace,” answered the Woodman; “I’ve\r\ntraveled it.”\r\n\r\n“But how are we to know how fast the Gump is flying?” persisted the\r\nboy. “We cannot see a single thing down on the earth, and before\r\nmorning we may be far beyond the place we want to reach.”\r\n\r\n“That is all true enough,” the Scarecrow replied, a little uneasily.\r\n“But I do not see how we can stop just now; for we might alight in a\r\nriver, or on, the top of a steeple; and that would be a great\r\ndisaster.”\r\n\r\nSo they permitted the Gump to fly on, with regular flops of its great\r\nwings, and waited patiently for morning.\r\n\r\nThen Tip’s fears were proven to be well founded; for with the first\r\nstreaks of gray dawn they looked over the sides of the sofas and\r\ndiscovered rolling plains dotted with queer villages, where the houses,\r\ninstead of being dome-shaped—as they all are in the Land of Oz—had\r\nslanting roofs that rose to a peak in the center. Odd looking animals\r\nwere also moving about upon the open plains, and the country was\r\nunfamiliar to both the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow, who had formerly\r\nvisited Glinda the Good’s domain and knew it well.\r\n\r\n“We are lost!” said the Scarecrow, dolefully. “The Gump must have\r\ncarried us entirely out of the Land of Oz and over the sandy deserts\r\nand into the terrible outside world that Dorothy told us about.”\r\n\r\n“We must get back,” exclaimed the Tin Woodman, earnestly. “we must get\r\nback as soon as possible!”\r\n\r\n“Turn around!” cried Tip to the Gump. “turn as quickly as you can!”\r\n\r\n“If I do I shall upset,” answered the Gump. “I’m not at all used to\r\nflying, and the best plan would be for me to alight in some place, and\r\nthen I can turn around and take a fresh start.”\r\n\r\nJust then, however, there seemed to be no stopping-place that would\r\nanswer their purpose. They flew over a village so big that the\r\nWoggle-Bug declared it was a city, and then they came to a range of\r\nhigh mountains with many deep gorges and steep cliffs showing plainly.\r\n\r\n“Now is our chance to stop,” said the boy, finding they were very close\r\nto the mountain tops. Then he turned to the Gump and commanded: “Stop\r\nat the first level place you see!”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” answered the Gump, and settled down upon a table of rock\r\nthat stood between two cliffs.\r\n\r\nBut not being experienced in such matters, the Gump did not judge his\r\nspeed correctly; and instead of coming to a stop upon the flat rock he\r\nmissed it by half the width of his body, breaking off both his right\r\nwings against the sharp edge of the rock and then tumbling over and\r\nover down the cliff.\r\n\r\nOur friends held on to the sofas as long as they could, but when the\r\nGump caught on a projecting rock the Thing stopped suddenly—bottom side\r\nup—and all were immediately dumped out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image239]\r\n\r\nBy good fortune they fell only a few feet; for underneath them was a\r\nmonster nest, built by a colony of Jackdaws in a hollow ledge of rock;\r\nso none of them—not even the Pumpkinhead—was injured by the fall. For\r\nJack found his precious head resting on the soft breast of the\r\nScarecrow, which made an excellent cushion; and Tip fell on a mass of\r\nleaves and papers, which saved him from injury. The Woggle-Bug had\r\nbumped his round head against the Saw-Horse, but without causing him\r\nmore than a moment’s inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman was at first much alarmed; but finding he had escaped\r\nwithout even a scratch upon his beautiful nickle-plate he at once\r\nregained his accustomed cheerfulness and turned to address his\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\n“Our Journey had ended rather suddenly,” said he; “and we cannot justly\r\nblame our friend the Gump for our accident, because he did the best he\r\ncould under the circumstances. But how we are ever to escape from this\r\nnest I must leave to someone with better brains than I possess.”\r\n\r\nHere he gazed at the Scarecrow; who crawled to the edge of the nest and\r\nlooked over. Below them was a sheer precipice several hundred feet in\r\ndepth. Above them was a smooth cliff unbroken save by the point of rock\r\nwhere the wrecked body of the Gump still hung suspended from the end of\r\none of the sofas. There really seemed to be no means of escape, and as\r\nthey realized their helpless plight the little band of adventurers gave\r\nway to their bewilderment.\r\n\r\n“This is a worse prison than the palace,” sadly remarked the\r\nWoggle-Bug.\r\n\r\n“I wish we had stayed there,” moaned Jack.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid the mountain air isn’t good for pumpkins.”\r\n\r\n“It won’t be when the Jackdaws come back,” growled the Saw-Horse, which\r\nlay waving its legs in a vain endeavor to get upon its feet again.\r\n“Jackdaws are especially fond of pumpkins.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think the birds will come here?” asked Jack, much distressed.\r\n\r\n“Of course they will,” said Tip; “for this is their nest. And there\r\nmust be hundreds of them,” he continued, “for see what a lot of things\r\nthey have brought here!”\r\n\r\nIndeed, the nest was half filled with a most curious collection of\r\nsmall articles for which the birds could have no use, but which the\r\nthieving Jackdaws had stolen during many years from the homes of men.\r\nAnd as the nest was safely hidden where no human being could reach it,\r\nthis lost property would never be recovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image242]\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug, searching among the rubbish—for the Jackdaws stole\r\nuseless things as well as valuable ones—turned up with his foot a\r\nbeautiful diamond necklace. This was so greatly admired by the Tin\r\nWoodman that the Woggle-Bug presented it to him with a graceful speech,\r\nafter which the Woodman hung it around his neck with much pride,\r\nrejoicing exceedingly when the big diamonds glittered in the sun’s\r\nrays.\r\n\r\nBut now they heard a great jabbering and flopping of wings, and as the\r\nsound grew nearer to them Tip exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“The Jackdaws are coming! And if they find us here they will surely\r\nkill us in their anger.”\r\n\r\n“I was afraid of this!” moaned the Pumpkinhead. “My time has come!”\r\n\r\n“And mine, also!” said the Woggle-Bug; “for Jackdaws are the greatest\r\nenemies of my race.”\r\n\r\nThe others were not at all afraid; but the Scarecrow at once decided to\r\nsave those of the party who were liable to be injured by the angry\r\nbirds. So he commanded Tip to take off Jack’s head and lie down with it\r\nin the bottom of the nest, and when this was done he ordered the\r\nWoggle-Bug to lie beside Tip. Nick Chopper, who knew from past\r\nexperience Just what to do, then took the Scarecrow to pieces (all\r\nexcept his head) and scattered the straw over Tip and the Woggle-Bug,\r\ncompletely covering their bodies.\r\n\r\nHardly had this been accomplished when the flock of Jackdaws reached\r\nthem. Perceiving the intruders in their nest the birds flew down upon\r\nthem with screams of rage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image244]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image245]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Nikidik’s Famous Wishing Pills\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman was usually a peaceful man, but when occasion required\r\nhe could fight as fiercely as a Roman gladiator. So, when the Jackdaws\r\nnearly knocked him down in their rush of wings, and their sharp beaks\r\nand claws threatened to damage his brilliant plating, the Woodman\r\npicked up his axe and made it whirl swiftly around his head.\r\n\r\nBut although many were beaten off in this way, the birds were so\r\nnumerous and so brave that they continued the attack as furiously as\r\nbefore. Some of them pecked at the eyes of the Gump, which hung over\r\nthe nest in a helpless condition; but the Gump’s eyes were of glass and\r\ncould not be injured. Others of the Jackdaws rushed at the Saw-Horse;\r\nbut that animal, being still upon his back, kicked out so viciously\r\nwith his wooden legs that he beat off as many assailants as did the\r\nWoodman’s axe.\r\n\r\nFinding themselves thus opposed, the birds fell upon the Scarecrow’s\r\nstraw, which lay at the center of the nest, covering Tip and the\r\nWoggle-Bug and Jack’s pumpkin head, and began tearing it away and\r\nflying off with it, only to let it drop, straw by straw into the great\r\ngulf beneath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image247]\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow’s head, noting with dismay this wanton destruction of his\r\ninterior, cried to the Tin Woodman to save him; and that good friend\r\nresponded with renewed energy. His axe fairly flashed among the\r\nJackdaws, and fortunately the Gump began wildly waving the two wings\r\nremaining on the left side of its body. The flutter of these great\r\nwings filled the Jackdaws with terror, and when the Gump by its\r\nexertions freed itself from the peg of rock on which it hung, and sank\r\nflopping into the nest, the alarm of the birds knew no bounds and they\r\nfled screaming over the mountains.\r\n\r\nWhen the last foe had disappeared, Tip crawled from under the sofas and\r\nassisted the Woggle-Bug to follow him.\r\n\r\n“We are saved!” shouted the boy, delightedly.\r\n\r\n“We are, indeed!” responded the Educated Insect, fairly hugging the\r\nstiff head of the Gump in his joy. “and we owe it all to the flopping\r\nof the Thing, and the good axe of the Woodman!”\r\n\r\n“If I am saved, get me out of here!” called Jack; whose head was still\r\nbeneath the sofas; and Tip managed to roll the pumpkin out and place it\r\nupon its neck again. He also set the Saw-Horse upright, and said to it:\r\n\r\n“We owe you many thanks for the gallant fight you made.”\r\n\r\n“I really think we have escaped very nicely,” remarked the Tin Woodman,\r\nin a tone of pride.\r\n\r\n“Not so!” exclaimed a hollow voice.\r\n\r\nAt this they all turned in surprise to look at the Scarecrow’s head,\r\nwhich lay at the back of the nest.\r\n\r\n“I am completely ruined!” declared the Scarecrow, as he noted their\r\nastonishment. “For where is the straw that stuffs my body?”\r\n\r\nThe awful question startled them all. They gazed around the nest with\r\nhorror, for not a vestige of straw remained. The Jackdaws had stolen it\r\nto the last wisp and flung it all into the chasm that yawned for\r\nhundreds of feet beneath the nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image249]\r\n\r\n“My poor, poor friend!” said the Tin Woodman, taking up the Scarecrow’s\r\nhead and caressing it tenderly; “whoever could imagine you would come\r\nto this untimely end?”\r\n\r\n“I did it to save my friends,” returned the head; “and I am glad that I\r\nperished in so noble and unselfish a manner.”\r\n\r\n“But why are you all so despondent?” inquired the Woggle-Bug. “The\r\nScarecrow’s clothing is still safe.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the Tin Woodman; “but our friend’s clothes are useless\r\nwithout stuffing.”\r\n\r\n“Why not stuff him with money?” asked Tip.\r\n\r\n“Money!” they all cried, in an amazed chorus.\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” said the boy. “In the bottom of the nest are thousands of\r\ndollar bills—and two-dollar bills—and five-dollar bills—and tens, and\r\ntwenties, and fifties. There are enough of them to stuff a dozen\r\nScarecrows. Why not use the money?”\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman began to turn over the rubbish with the handle of his\r\naxe; and, sure enough, what they had first thought only worthless\r\npapers were found to be all bills of various denominations, which the\r\nmischievous Jackdaws had for years been engaged in stealing from the\r\nvillages and cities they visited.\r\n\r\nThere was an immense fortune lying in that inaccessible nest; and Tip’s\r\nsuggestion was, with the Scarecrow’s consent, quickly acted upon.\r\n\r\nThey selected all the newest and cleanest bills and assorted them into\r\nvarious piles. The Scarecrow’s left leg and boot were stuffed with\r\nfive-dollar bills; his right leg was stuffed with ten-dollar bills, and\r\nhis body so closely filled with fifties, one-hundreds and one-thousands\r\nthat he could scarcely button his jacket with comfort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image251]\r\n\r\n“You are now” said the Woggle-Bug, impressively, when the task had been\r\ncompleted, “the most valuable member of our party; and as you are among\r\nfaithful friends there is little danger of your being spent.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” returned the Scarecrow, gratefully. “I feel like a new\r\nman; and although at first glance I might be mistaken for a Safety\r\nDeposit Vault, I beg you to remember that my Brains are still composed\r\nof the same old material. And these are the possessions that have\r\nalways made me a person to be depended upon in an emergency.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the emergency is here,” observed Tip; “and unless your brains\r\nhelp us out of it we shall be compelled to pass the remainder of our\r\nlives in this nest.”\r\n\r\n“How about these wishing pills?” enquired the Scarecrow, taking the box\r\nfrom his jacket pocket. “Can’t we use them to escape?”\r\n\r\n“Not unless we can count seventeen by twos,” answered the Tin Woodman.\r\n“But our friend the Woggle-Bug claims to be highly educated, so he\r\nought easily to figure out how that can be done.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t a question of education,” returned the Insect; “it’s merely a\r\nquestion of mathematics. I’ve seen the professor work lots of sums on\r\nthe blackboard, and he claimed anything could be done with x’s and y’s\r\nand a’s, and such things, by mixing them up with plenty of plusses and\r\nminuses and equals, and so forth. But he never said anything, so far as\r\nI can remember, about counting up to the odd number of seventeen by the\r\neven numbers of twos.”\r\n\r\n“Stop! stop!” cried the Pumpkinhead. “You’re making my head ache.”\r\n\r\n“And mine,” added the Scarecrow. “Your mathematics seem to me very like\r\na bottle of mixed pickles the more you fish for what you want the less\r\nchance you have of getting it. I am certain that if the thing can be\r\naccomplished at all, it is in a very simple manner.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Tip. “old Mombi couldn’t use x’s and minuses, for she never\r\nwent to school.”\r\n\r\n“Why not start counting at a half of one?” asked the Saw-Horse,\r\nabruptly. “Then anyone can count up to seventeen by twos very easily.”\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other in surprise, for the Saw-Horse was considered\r\nthe most stupid of the entire party.\r\n\r\n“You make me quite ashamed of myself,” said the Scarecrow, bowing low\r\nto the Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, the creature is right,” declared the Woggle-Bug; “for\r\ntwice one-half is one, and if you get to one it is easy to count from\r\none up to seventeen by twos.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder I didn’t think of that myself,” said the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n“I don’t,” returned the Scarecrow. “You’re no wiser than the rest of\r\nus, are you? But let us make a wish at once. Who will swallow the first\r\npill?”\r\n\r\n“Suppose you do it,” suggested Tip.\r\n\r\n“I can’t,” said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“Why not? You’ve a mouth, haven’t you?” asked the boy.\r\n\r\n“Yes; but my mouth is painted on, and there’s no swallow connected with\r\nit,” answered the Scarecrow. “In fact,” he continued, looking from one\r\nto another critically, “I believe the boy and the Woggle-Bug are the\r\nonly ones in our party that are able to swallow.”\r\n\r\nObserving the truth of this remark, Tip said:\r\n\r\n“Then I will undertake to make the first wish. Give me one of the\r\nSilver Pills.”\r\n\r\nThis the Scarecrow tried to do; but his padded gloves were too clumsy\r\nto clutch so small an object, and he held the box toward the boy while\r\nTip selected one of the pills and swallowed it.\r\n\r\n“Count!” cried the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“One-half, one, three, five, seven, nine, eleven,” counted Tip.\r\n“thirteen, fifteen, seventeen.”\r\n\r\n“Now wish!” said the Tin Woodman anxiously:\r\n\r\nBut Just then the boy began to suffer such fearful pains that he became\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\n“The pill has poisoned me!” he gasped; “O—h! O-o-o-o-o! Ouch! Murder!\r\nFire! O-o-h!” and here he rolled upon the bottom of the nest in such\r\ncontortions that he frightened them all.\r\n\r\n“What can we do for you. Speak, I beg!” entreated the Tin Woodman,\r\ntears of sympathy running down his nickel cheeks.\r\n\r\n“I—I don’t know!” answered Tip. “O—h! I wish I’d never swallowed that\r\npill!”\r\n\r\nThen at once the pain stopped, and the boy rose to his feet again and\r\nfound the Scarecrow looking with amazement at the end of the\r\npepper-box.\r\n\r\n“What’s happened?” asked the boy, a little ashamed of his recent\r\nexhibition.\r\n\r\n“Why, the three pills are in the box again!” said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“Of course they are,” the Woggle-Bug declared. “Didn’t Tip wish that\r\nhe’d never swallowed one of them? Well, the wish came true, and he\r\n_didn’t_ swallow one of them. So of course they are all three in the\r\nbox.”\r\n\r\n“That may be; but the pill gave me a dreadful pain, just the same,”\r\nsaid the boy.\r\n\r\n“Impossible!” declared the Woggle-Bug. “If you have never swallowed it,\r\nthe pill can not have given you a pain. And as your wish, being\r\ngranted, proves you did not swallow the pill, it is also plain that you\r\nsuffered no pain.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image255]\r\n\r\n“Then it was a splendid imitation of a pain,” retorted Tip, angrily.\r\n“Suppose you try the next pill yourself. We’ve wasted one wish\r\nalready.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, we haven’t!” protested the Scarecrow. “Here are still three\r\npills in the box, and each pill is good for a wish.”\r\n\r\n“Now you’re making _my_ head ache,” said Tip. “I can’t understand the\r\nthing at all. But I won’t take another pill, I promise you!” and with\r\nthis remark he retired sulkily to the back of the nest.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Woggle-Bug, “it remains for me to save us in my most\r\nHighly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated manner; for I seem to be the\r\nonly one able and willing to make a wish. Let me have one of the\r\npills.”\r\n\r\nHe swallowed it without hesitation, and they all stood admiring his\r\ncourage while the Insect counted seventeen by twos in the same way that\r\nTip had done. And for some reason—perhaps because Woggle-Bugs have\r\nstronger stomachs than boys—the silver pellet caused it no pain\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n“I wish the Gump’s broken wings mended, and as good as new!” said the\r\nWoggle-Bug, in a slow; impressive voice.\r\n\r\nAll turned to look at the Thing, and so quickly had the wish been\r\ngranted that the Gump lay before them in perfect repair, and as well\r\nable to fly through the air as when it had first been brought to life\r\non the roof of the palace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image257]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image258]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image259]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow Appeals to Glinda the Good\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hooray!” shouted the Scarecrow, gaily. “We can now leave this\r\nmiserable Jackdaws’ nest whenever we please.”\r\n\r\n“But it is nearly dark,” said the Tin Woodman; “and unless we wait\r\nuntil morning to make our flight we may get into more trouble. I don’t\r\nlike these night trips, for one never knows what will happen.”\r\n\r\nSo it was decided to wait until daylight, and the adventurers amused\r\nthemselves in the twilight by searching the Jackdaws’ nest for\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\nThe Woggle-Bug found two handsome bracelets of wrought gold, which\r\nfitted his slender arms very well. The Scarecrow took a fancy for\r\nrings, of which there were many in the nest. Before long he had fitted\r\na ring to each finger of his padded gloves, and not being content with\r\nthat display he added one more to each thumb. As he carefully chose\r\nthose rings set with sparkling stones, such as rubies, amethysts and\r\nsapphires, the Scarecrow’s hands now presented a most brilliant\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n“This nest would be a picnic for Queen Jinjur,” said he, musingly. “for\r\nas nearly as I can make out she and her girls conquered me merely to\r\nrob my city of its emeralds.”\r\n\r\nThe Tin Woodman was content with his diamond necklace and refused to\r\naccept any additional decorations; but Tip secured a fine gold watch,\r\nwhich was attached to a heavy fob, and placed it in his pocket with\r\nmuch pride. He also pinned several jeweled brooches to Jack\r\nPumpkinhead’s red waistcoat, and attached a lorgnette, by means of a\r\nfine chain, to the neck of the Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n“It’s very pretty,” said the creature, regarding the lorgnette\r\napprovingly; “but what is it for?”\r\n\r\nNone of them could answer that question, however; so the Saw-Horse\r\ndecided it was some rare decoration and became very fond of it.\r\n\r\nThat none of the party might be slighted, they ended by placing several\r\nlarge seal rings upon the points of the Gump’s antlers, although that\r\nodd personage seemed by no means gratified by the attention.\r\n\r\nDarkness soon fell upon them, and Tip and the Woggle-Bug went to sleep\r\nwhile the others sat down to wait patiently for the day.\r\n\r\nNext morning they had cause to congratulate themselves upon the useful\r\ncondition of the Gump; for with daylight a great flock of Jackdaws\r\napproached to engage in one more battle for the possession of the nest.\r\n\r\nBut our adventurers did not wait for the assault. They tumbled into the\r\ncushioned seats of the sofas as quickly as possible, and Tip gave the\r\nword to the Gump to start.\r\n\r\nAt once it rose into the air, the great wings flopping strongly and\r\nwith regular motions, and in a few moments they were so far from the\r\nnest that the chattering Jackdaws took possession without any attempt\r\nat pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe Thing flew due North, going in the same direction from whence it\r\nhad come. At least, that was the Scarecrow’s opinion, and the others\r\nagreed that the Scarecrow was the best judge of direction. After\r\npassing over several cities and villages the Gump carried them high\r\nabove a broad plain where houses became more and more scattered until\r\nthey disappeared altogether. Next came the wide, sandy desert\r\nseparating the rest of the world from the Land of Oz, and before noon\r\nthey saw the dome-shaped houses that proved they were once more within\r\nthe borders of their native land.\r\n\r\n“But the houses and fences are blue,” said the Tin Woodman, “and that\r\nindicates we are in the land of the Munchkins, and therefore a long\r\ndistance from Glinda the Good.”\r\n\r\n“What shall we do?” asked the boy, turning to their guide.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know” replied the Scarecrow, frankly. “If we were at the\r\nEmerald City we could then move directly southward, and so reach our\r\ndestination. But we dare not go to the Emerald City, and the Gump is\r\nprobably carrying us further in the wrong direction with every flop of\r\nits wings.”\r\n\r\n“Then the Woggle-Bug must swallow another pill,” said Tip, decidedly,\r\n“and wish us headed in the right direction.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” returned the Highly Magnified one; “I’m willing.”\r\n\r\nBut when the Scarecrow searched in his pocket for the pepper-box\r\ncontaining the two silver Wishing Pills, it was not to be found. Filled\r\nwith anxiety, the voyagers hunted throughout every inch of the Thing\r\nfor the precious box; but it had disappeared entirely.\r\n\r\nAnd still the Gump flew onward, carrying them they knew not where.\r\n\r\n“I must have left the pepper-box in the Jackdaws’ nest,” said the\r\nScarecrow, at length.\r\n\r\n“It is a great misfortune,” the Tin Woodman declared. “But we are no\r\nworse off than before we discovered the Wishing Pills.”\r\n\r\n“We are better off,” replied Tip. “for the one pill we used has enabled\r\nus to escape from that horrible nest.”\r\n\r\n“Yet the loss of the other two is serious, and I deserve a good\r\nscolding for my carelessness,” the Scarecrow rejoined, penitently. “For\r\nin such an unusual party as this accidents are liable to happen any\r\nmoment, and even now we may be approaching a new danger.”\r\n\r\nNo one dared contradict this, and a dismal silence ensued.\r\n\r\nThe Gump flew steadily on.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Tip uttered an exclamation of surprise. “We must have reached\r\nthe South Country,” he cried, “for below us everything is red!”\r\n\r\nImmediately they all leaned over the backs of the sofas to look—all\r\nexcept Jack, who was too careful of his pumpkin head to risk its\r\nslipping off his neck. Sure enough; the red houses and fences and trees\r\nindicated they were within the domain of Glinda the Good; and\r\npresently, as they glided rapidly on, the Tin Woodman recognized the\r\nroads and buildings they passed, and altered slightly the flight of the\r\nGump so that they might reach the palace of the celebrated Sorceress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image264]\r\n\r\n“Good!” cried the Scarecrow, delightedly. “We do not need the lost\r\nWishing Pills now, for we have arrived at our destination.”\r\n\r\nGradually the Thing sank lower and nearer to the ground until at length\r\nit came to rest within the beautiful gardens of Glinda, settling upon a\r\nvelvety green lawn close by a fountain which sent sprays of flashing\r\ngems, instead of water, high into the air, whence they fell with a\r\nsoft, tinkling sound into the carved marble basin placed to receive\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEverything was very gorgeous in Glinda’s gardens, and while our\r\nvoyagers gazed about with admiring eyes a company of soldiers silently\r\nappeared and surrounded them. But these soldiers of the great Sorceress\r\nwere entirely different from those of Jinjur’s Army of Revolt, although\r\nthey were likewise girls. For Glinda’s soldiers wore neat uniforms and\r\nbore swords and spears; and they marched with a skill and precision\r\nthat proved them well trained in the arts of war.\r\n\r\nThe Captain commanding this troop—which was Glinda’s private Body\r\nGuard—recognized the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman at once, and greeted\r\nthem with respectful salutations.\r\n\r\n“Good day!” said the Scarecrow, gallantly removing his hat, while the\r\nWoodman gave a soldierly salute; “we have come to request an audience\r\nwith your fair Ruler.”\r\n\r\n“Glinda is now within her palace, awaiting you,” returned the Captain;\r\n“for she saw you coming long before you arrived.”\r\n\r\n“That is strange!” said Tip, wondering.\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” answered the Scarecrow, “for Glinda the Good is a mighty\r\nSorceress, and nothing that goes on in the Land of Oz escapes her\r\nnotice. I suppose she knows why we came as well as we do ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“Then what was the use of our coming?” asked Jack, stupidly.\r\n\r\n“To prove you are a Pumpkinhead!” retorted the Scarecrow. “But, if the\r\nSorceress expects us, we must not keep her waiting.”\r\n\r\nSo they all clambered out of the sofas and followed the Captain toward\r\nthe palace—even the Saw-Horse taking his place in the queer procession.\r\n\r\nUpon her throne of finely wrought gold sat Glinda, and she could\r\nscarcely repress a smile as her peculiar visitors entered and bowed\r\nbefore her. Both the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman she knew and liked;\r\nbut the awkward Pumpkinhead and Highly Magnified Woggle-Bug were\r\ncreatures she had never seen before, and they seemed even more curious\r\nthan the others. As for the Saw-Horse, he looked to be nothing more\r\nthan an animated chunk of wood; and he bowed so stiffly that his head\r\nbumped against the floor, causing a ripple of laughter among the\r\nsoldiers, in which Glinda frankly joined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image266]\r\n\r\n“I beg to announce to your glorious highness,” began the Scarecrow, in\r\na solemn voice, “that my Emerald City has been overrun by a crowd of\r\nimpudent girls with knitting-needles, who have enslaved all the men,\r\nrobbed the streets and public buildings of all their emerald jewels,\r\nand usurped my throne.”\r\n\r\n“I know it,” said Glinda.\r\n\r\n“They also threatened to destroy me, as well as all the good friends\r\nand allies you see before you,” continued the Scarecrow. “and had we\r\nnot managed to escape their clutches our days would long since have\r\nended.”\r\n\r\n“I know it,” repeated Glinda.\r\n\r\n“Therefore I have come to beg your assistance,” resumed the Scarecrow,\r\n“for I believe you are always glad to succor the unfortunate and\r\noppressed.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” replied the Sorceress, slowly. “But the Emerald City is\r\nnow ruled by General Jinjur, who has caused herself to be proclaimed\r\nQueen. What right have I to oppose her?”\r\n\r\n“Why, she stole the throne from me,” said the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“And how came you to possess the throne?” asked Glinda.\r\n\r\n“I got it from the Wizard of Oz, and by the choice of the people,”\r\nreturned the Scarecrow, uneasy at such questioning.\r\n\r\n“And where did the Wizard get it?” she continued gravely.\r\n\r\n“I am told he took it from Pastoria, the former King,” said the\r\nScarecrow, becoming confused under the intent look of the Sorceress.\r\n\r\n“Then,” declared Glinda, “the throne of the Emerald City belongs\r\nneither to you nor to Jinjur, but to this Pastoria from whom the Wizard\r\nusurped it.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” acknowledged the Scarecrow, humbly; “but Pastoria is\r\nnow dead and gone, and some one must rule in his place.”\r\n\r\n“Pastoria had a daughter, who is the rightful heir to the throne of the\r\nEmerald City. Did you know that?” questioned the Sorceress.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the Scarecrow. “But if the girl still lives I will not\r\nstand in her way. It will satisfy me as well to have Jinjur turned out,\r\nas an impostor, as to regain the throne myself. In fact, it isn’t much\r\nfun to be King, especially if one has good brains. I have known for\r\nsome time that I am fitted to occupy a far more exalted position. But\r\nwhere is the girl who owns the throne, and what is her name?”\r\n\r\n“Her name is Ozma,” answered Glinda. “But where she is I have tried in\r\nvain to discover. For the Wizard of Oz, when he stole the throne from\r\nOzma’s father, hid the girl in some secret place; and by means of a\r\nmagical trick with which I am not familiar he also managed to prevent\r\nher being discovered—even by so experienced a Sorceress as myself.”\r\n\r\n“That is strange,” interrupted the Woggle-Bug, pompously. “I have been\r\ninformed that the Wonderful Wizard of Oz was nothing more than a\r\nhumbug!”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” exclaimed the Scarecrow, much provoked by this speech.\r\n“Didn’t he give me a wonderful set of brains?”\r\n\r\n“There’s no humbug about my heart,” announced the Tin Woodman, glaring\r\nindignantly at the Woggle-Bug.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I was misinformed,” stammered the Insect, shrinking back; “I\r\nnever knew the Wizard personally.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we did,” retorted the Scarecrow, “and he was a very great\r\nWizard, I assure you. It is true he was guilty of some slight\r\nimpostures, but unless he was a great Wizard how—let me ask—could he\r\nhave hidden this girl Ozma so securely that no one can find her?”\r\n\r\n“I—I give it up!” replied the Woggle-Bug, meekly.\r\n\r\n“That is the most sensible speech you’ve made,” said the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n“I must really make another effort to discover where this girl is\r\nhidden,” resumed the Sorceress, thoughtfully. “I have in my library a\r\nbook in which is inscribed every action of the Wizard while he was in\r\nour land of Oz—or, at least, every action that could be observed by my\r\nspies. This book I will read carefully tonight, and try to single out\r\nthe acts that may guide us in discovering the lost Ozma. In the\r\nmeantime, pray amuse yourselves in my palace and command my servants as\r\nif they were your own. I will grant you another audience tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image271]\r\n\r\nWith this gracious speech Glinda dismissed the adventurers, and they\r\nwandered away through the beautiful gardens, where they passed several\r\nhours enjoying all the delightful things with which the Queen of the\r\nSouthland had surrounded her royal palace.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning they again appeared before Glinda, who said to\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n“I have searched carefully through the records of the Wizard’s actions,\r\nand among them I can find but three that appear to have been\r\nsuspicious. He ate beans with a knife, made three secret visits to old\r\nMombi, and limped slightly on his left foot.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that last is certainly suspicious!” exclaimed the Pumpkinhead.\r\n\r\n“Not necessarily,” said the Scarecrow. “he may, have had corns. Now, it\r\nseems to me his eating beans with a knife is more suspicious.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it is a polite custom in Omaha, from which great country the\r\nWizard originally came,” suggested the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n“It may be,” admitted the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n“But why,” asked Glinda, “did he make three secret visits to old\r\nMombi?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Why, indeed!” echoed the Woggle-Bug, impressively.\r\n\r\n“We know that the Wizard taught the old woman many of his tricks of\r\nmagic,” continued Glinda; “and this he would not have done had she not\r\nassisted him in some way. So we may suspect with good reason that Mombi\r\naided him to hide the girl Ozma, who was the real heir to the throne of\r\nthe Emerald City, and a constant danger to the usurper. For, if the\r\npeople knew that she lived, they would quickly make her their Queen and\r\nrestore her to her rightful position.”\r\n\r\n“An able argument!” cried the Scarecrow. “I have no doubt that Mombi\r\nwas mixed up in this wicked business. But how does that knowledge help\r\nus?”\r\n\r\n“We must find Mombi,” replied Glinda, “and force her to tell where the\r\ngirl is hidden.”\r\n\r\n“Mombi is now with Queen Jinjur, in the Emerald, City” said Tip. “It\r\nwas she who threw so many obstacles in our pathway, and made Jinjur\r\nthreaten to destroy my friends and give me back into the old witch’s\r\npower.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” decided Glinda, “I will march with my army to the Emerald City,\r\nand take Mombi prisoner. After that we can, perhaps, force her to tell\r\nthe truth about Ozma.”\r\n\r\n“She is a terrible old woman!” remarked Tip, with a shudder at the\r\nthought of Mombi’s black kettle; “and obstinate, too.”\r\n\r\n“I am quite obstinate myself,” returned the Sorceress, with a sweet\r\nsmile. “so I do not fear Mombi in the least. Today I will make all\r\nnecessary preparations, and we will march upon the Emerald City at\r\ndaybreak tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image275]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image276]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image277]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tin-Woodman Plucks a Rose\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Army of Glinda the Good looked very grand and imposing when it\r\nassembled at daybreak before the palace gates. The uniforms of the girl\r\nsoldiers were pretty and of gay colors, and their silver-tipped spears\r\nwere bright and glistening, the long shafts being inlaid with\r\nmother-of-pearl. All the officers wore sharp, gleaming swords, and\r\nshields edged with peacock-feathers; and it really seemed that no foe\r\ncould by any possibility defeat such a brilliant army.\r\n\r\nThe Sorceress rode in a beautiful palanquin which was like the body of\r\na coach, having doors and windows with silken curtains; but instead of\r\nwheels, which a coach has, the palanquin rested upon two long,\r\nhorizontal bars, which were borne upon the shoulders of twelve\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow and his comrades decided to ride in the Gump, in order to\r\nkeep up with the swift march of the army; so, as soon as Glinda had\r\nstarted and her soldiers had marched away to the inspiring strains of\r\nmusic played by the royal band, our friends climbed into the sofas and\r\nfollowed. The Gump flew along slowly at a point directly over the\r\npalanquin in which rode the Sorceress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image278]\r\n\r\n“Be careful,” said the Tin Woodman to the Scarecrow, who was leaning\r\nfar over the side to look at the army below. “You might fall.”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t matter,” remarked the educated Woggle-Bug. “he can’t get\r\nbroke so long as he is stuffed with money.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t I ask you” began Tip, in a reproachful voice.\r\n\r\n“You did!” said the Woggle-Bug, promptly. “And I beg your pardon. I\r\nwill really try to restrain myself.”\r\n\r\n“You’d better,” declared the boy. “That is, if you wish to travel in\r\nour company.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I couldn’t bear to part with you now,” murmured the Insect,\r\nfeelingly; so Tip let the subject drop.\r\n\r\nThe army moved steadily on, but night had fallen before they came to\r\nthe walls of the Emerald City. By the dim light of the new moon,\r\nhowever, Glinda’s forces silently surrounded the city and pitched their\r\ntents of scarlet silk upon the greensward. The tent of the Sorceress\r\nwas larger than the others, and was composed of pure white silk, with\r\nscarlet banners flying above it. A tent was also pitched for the\r\nScarecrow’s party; and when these preparations had been made, with\r\nmilitary precision and quickness, the army retired to rest.\r\n\r\nGreat was the amazement of Queen Jinjur next morning when her soldiers\r\ncame running to inform her of the vast army surrounding them. She at\r\nonce climbed to a high tower of the royal palace and saw banners waving\r\nin every direction and the great white tent of Glinda standing directly\r\nbefore the gates.\r\n\r\n“We are surely lost!” cried Jinjur, in despair; “for how can our\r\nknitting-needles avail against the long spears and terrible swords of\r\nour foes?”\r\n\r\n“The best thing we can do,” said one of the girls, “is to surrender as\r\nquickly as possible, before we get hurt.”\r\n\r\n“Not so,” returned Jinjur, more bravely. “The enemy is still outside\r\nthe walls, so we must try to gain time by engaging them in parley. Go\r\nyou with a flag of truce to Glinda and ask her why she has dared to\r\ninvade my dominions, and what are her demands.”\r\n\r\nSo the girl passed through the gates, bearing a white flag to show she\r\nwas on a mission of peace, and came to Glinda’s tent. “Tell your\r\nQueen,” said the Sorceress to the girl, “that she must deliver up to me\r\nold Mombi, to be my prisoner. If this is done I will not molest her\r\nfarther.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image280]\r\n\r\nNow when this message was delivered to the Queen it filled her with\r\ndismay, for Mombi was her chief counsellor, and Jinjur was terribly\r\nafraid of the old hag. But she sent for Mombi, and told her what Glinda\r\nhad said.\r\n\r\n“I see trouble ahead for all of us,” muttered the old witch, after\r\nglancing into a magic mirror she carried in her pocket. “But we may\r\neven yet escape by deceiving this sorceress, clever as she thinks\r\nherself.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think it will be safer for me to deliver you into her\r\nhands?” asked Jinjur, nervously.\r\n\r\n“If you do, it will cost you the throne of the Emerald City!” answered\r\nthe witch, positively. “But if you will let me have my own way, I can\r\nsave us both very easily.”\r\n\r\n“Then do as you please,” replied Jinjur, “for it is so aristocratic to\r\nbe a Queen that I do not wish to be obliged to return home again, to\r\nmake beds and wash dishes for my mother.”\r\n\r\nSo Mombi called Jellia Jamb to her, and performed a certain magical\r\nrite with which she was familiar. As a result of the enchantment Jellia\r\ntook on the form and features of Mombi, while the old witch grew to\r\nresemble the girl so closely that it seemed impossible anyone could\r\nguess the deception.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said old Mombi to the Queen, “let your soldiers deliver up this\r\ngirl to Glinda. She will think she has the real Mombi in her power, and\r\nso will return immediately to her own country in the South.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image282]\r\n\r\nTherefore Jellia, hobbling along like an aged woman, was led from the\r\ncity gates and taken before Glinda.\r\n\r\n“Here is the person you demanded,” said one of the guards, “and our\r\nQueen now begs you will go away, as you promised, and leave us in\r\npeace.”\r\n\r\n“That I will surely do,” replied Glinda, much pleased; “if this is\r\nreally the person she seems to be.”\r\n\r\n“It is certainly old Mombi,” said the guard, who believed she was\r\nspeaking the truth; and then Jinjur’s soldiers returned within the\r\ncity’s gates.\r\n\r\nThe Sorceress quickly summoned the Scarecrow and his friends to her\r\ntent, and began to question the supposed Mombi about the lost girl\r\nOzma. But Jellia knew nothing at all of this affair, and presently she\r\ngrew so nervous under the questioning that she gave way and began to\r\nweep, to Glinda’s great astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Here is some foolish trickery!” said the Sorceress, her eyes flashing\r\nwith anger. “This is not Mombi at all, but some other person who has\r\nbeen made to resemble her! Tell me,” she demanded, turning to the\r\ntrembling girl, “what is your name?”\r\n\r\nThis Jellia dared not tell, having been threatened with death by the\r\nwitch if she confessed the fraud. But Glinda, sweet and fair though she\r\nwas, understood magic better than any other person in the Land of Oz.\r\nSo, by uttering a few potent words and making a peculiar gesture, she\r\nquickly transformed the girl into her proper shape, while at the same\r\ntime old Mombi, far away in Jinjur’s palace, suddenly resumed her own\r\ncrooked form and evil features.\r\n\r\n“Why, it’s Jellia Jamb!” cried the Scarecrow, recognizing in the girl\r\none of his old friends.\r\n\r\n“It’s our interpreter!” said the Pumpkinhead, smiling pleasantly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image284]\r\n\r\nThen Jellia was forced to tell of the trick Mombi had played and she\r\nalso begged Glinda’s protection, which the Sorceress readily granted.\r\nBut Glinda was now really angry, and sent word to Jinjur that the fraud\r\nwas discovered and she must deliver up the real Mombi or suffer\r\nterrible consequences. Jinjur was prepared for this message, for the\r\nwitch well understood, when her natural form was thrust upon her, that\r\nGlinda had discovered her trickery. But the wicked old creature had\r\nalready thought up a new deception, and had made Jinjur promise to\r\ncarry it out. So the Queen said to Glinda’s messenger:\r\n\r\n“Tell your mistress that I cannot find Mombi anywhere, but that Glinda\r\nis welcome to enter the city and search herself for the old woman. She\r\nmay also bring her friends with her, if she likes; but if she does not\r\nfind Mombi by sundown, the Sorceress must promise to go away peaceably\r\nand bother us no more.”\r\n\r\nGlinda agreed to these terms, well knowing that Mombi was somewhere\r\nwithin the city walls. So Jinjur caused the gates to be thrown open,\r\nand Glinda marched in at the head of a company of soldiers, followed by\r\nthe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, while Jack Pumpkinhead rode astride\r\nthe Saw-Horse, and the Educated, Highly Magnified Woggle-Bug sauntered\r\nbehind in a dignified manner. Tip walked by the side of the Sorceress,\r\nfor Glinda had conceived a great liking for the boy.\r\n\r\nOf course old Mombi had no intention of being found by Glinda; so,\r\nwhile her enemies were marching up the street, the witch transformed\r\nherself into a red rose growing upon a bush in the garden of the\r\npalace. It was a clever idea, and a trick Glinda did not suspect; so\r\nseveral precious hours were spent in a vain search for Mombi.\r\n\r\nAs sundown approached the Sorceress realized she had been defeated by\r\nthe superior cunning of the aged witch; so she gave the command to her\r\npeople to march out of the city and back to their tents.\r\n\r\nThe Scarecrow and his comrades happened to be searching in the garden\r\nof the palace just then, and they turned with disappointment to obey\r\nGlinda’s command. But before they left the garden the Tin Woodman, who\r\nwas fond of flowers, chanced to espy a big red rose growing upon a\r\nbush; so he plucked the flower and fastened it securely in the tin\r\nbuttonhole of his tin bosom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image285]\r\n\r\nAs he did this he fancied he heard a low moan proceed from the rose;\r\nbut he paid no attention to the sound, and Mombi was thus carried out\r\nof the city and into Glinda’s camp without anyone having a suspicion\r\nthat they had succeeded in their quest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image288]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image289]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Transformation of Old Mombi\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Witch was at first frightened at finding herself captured by the\r\nenemy; but soon she decided that she was exactly as safe in the Tin\r\nWoodman’s button-hole as growing upon the bush. For no one knew the\r\nrose and Mombi to be one, and now that she was without the gates of the\r\nCity her chances of escaping altogether from Glinda were much improved.\r\n\r\n“But there is no hurry,” thought Mombi. “I will wait awhile and enjoy\r\nthe humiliation of this Sorceress when she finds I have outwitted her.”\r\nSo throughout the night the rose lay quietly on the Woodman’s bosom,\r\nand in the morning, when Glinda summoned our friends to a consultation,\r\nNick Chopper carried his pretty flower with him to the white silk tent.\r\n\r\n“For some reason,” said Glinda, “we have failed to find this cunning\r\nold Mombi; so I fear our expedition will prove a failure. And for that\r\nI am sorry, because without our assistance little Ozma will never be\r\nrescued and restored to her rightful position as Queen of the Emerald\r\nCity”\r\n\r\n“Do not let us give up so easily,” said the Pumpkinhead. “Let us do\r\nsomething else.”\r\n\r\n“Something else must really be done,” replied Glinda, with a smile.\r\n“yet I cannot understand how I have been defeated so easily by an old\r\nWitch who knows far less of magic than I do myself.”\r\n\r\n“While we are on the ground I believe it would be wise for us to\r\nconquer the Emerald City for Princess Ozma, and find the girl\r\nafterward,” said the Scarecrow. “And while the girl remains hidden I\r\nwill gladly rule in her place, for I understand the business of ruling\r\nmuch better than Jinjur does.”\r\n\r\n“But I have promised not to molest Jinjur,” objected Glinda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image290]\r\n\r\n“Suppose you all return with me to my kingdom—or Empire, rather,” said\r\nthe Tin Woodman, politely including the entire party in a royal wave of\r\nhis arm. “It will give me great pleasure to entertain you in my castle,\r\nwhere there is room enough and to spare. And if any of you wish to be\r\nnickel-plated, my valet will do it free of all expense.”\r\n\r\nWhile the Woodman was speaking Glinda’s eyes had been noting the rose\r\nin his button-hole, and now she imagined she saw the big red leaves of\r\nthe flower tremble slightly. This quickly aroused her suspicions, and\r\nin a moment more the Sorceress had decided that the seeming rose was\r\nnothing else than a transformation of old Mombi. At the same instant\r\nMombi knew she was discovered and must quickly plan an escape, and as\r\ntransformations were easy to her she immediately took the form of a\r\nShadow and glided along the wall of the tent toward the entrance,\r\nthinking thus to disappear.\r\n\r\nBut Glinda had not only equal cunning, but far more experience than the\r\nWitch. So the Sorceress reached the opening of the tent before the\r\nShadow, and with a wave of her hand closed the entrance so securely\r\nthat Mombi could not find a crack big enough to creep through. The\r\nScarecrow and his friends were greatly surprised at Glinda’s actions;\r\nfor none of them had noted the Shadow. But the Sorceress said to them:\r\n\r\n“Remain perfectly quiet, all of you! For the old Witch is even now with\r\nus in this tent, and I hope to capture her.”\r\n\r\nThese words so alarmed Mombi that she quickly transformed herself from\r\na shadow to a Black Ant, in which shape she crawled along the ground,\r\nseeking a crack or crevice in which to hide her tiny body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image293]\r\n\r\nFortunately, the ground where the tent had been pitched, being Just\r\nbefore the city gates, was hard and smooth; and while the Ant still\r\ncrawled about, Glinda discovered it and ran quickly forward to effect\r\nits capture But, Just as her hand was descending, the Witch, now fairly\r\nfrantic with fear, made her last transformation, and in the form of a\r\nhuge Griffin sprang through the wall of the tent—tearing the silk\r\nasunder in her rush—and in a moment had darted away with the speed of a\r\nwhirlwind.\r\n\r\nGlinda did not hesitate to follow. She sprang upon the back of the\r\nSaw-Horse and cried:\r\n\r\n“Now you shall prove that you have a right to be alive! Run—run—run!”\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse ran. Like a flash he followed the Griffin, his wooden\r\nlegs moving so fast that they twinkled like the rays of a star. Before\r\nour friends could recover from their surprise both the Griffin and the\r\nSaw-Horse had dashed out of sight.\r\n\r\n“Come! Let us follow!” cried the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\nThey ran to the place where the Gump was lying and quickly tumbled\r\naboard.\r\n\r\n“Fly!” commanded Tip, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Where to?” asked the Gump, in its calm voice.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” returned Tip, who was very nervous at the delay; “but\r\nif you will mount into the air I think we can discover which way Glinda\r\nhas gone.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” returned the Gump, quietly; and it spread its great wings\r\nand mounted high into the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image295]\r\n\r\nFar away, across the meadows, they could now see two tiny specks,\r\nspeeding one after the other; and they knew these specks must be the\r\nGriffin and the Saw-Horse. So Tip called the Gump’s attention to them\r\nand bade the creature try to overtake the Witch and the Sorceress. But,\r\nswift as was the Gump’s flight, the pursued and pursuer moved more\r\nswiftly yet, and within a few moments were blotted out against the dim\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n“Let us continue to follow them, nevertheless,” said the Scarecrow.\r\n“for the Land of Oz is of small extent, and sooner or later they must\r\nboth come to a halt.”\r\n\r\nOld Mombi had thought herself very wise to choose the form of a\r\nGriffin, for its legs were exceedingly fleet and its strength more\r\nenduring than that of other animals. But she had not reckoned on the\r\nuntiring energy of the Saw-Horse, whose wooden limbs could run for days\r\nwithout slacking their speed. Therefore, after an hour’s hard running,\r\nthe Griffin’s breath began to fail, and it panted and gasped painfully,\r\nand moved more slowly than before. Then it reached the edge of the\r\ndesert and began racing across the deep sands. But its tired feet sank\r\nfar into the sand, and in a few minutes the Griffin fell forward,\r\ncompletely exhausted, and lay still upon the desert waste.\r\n\r\nGlinda came up a moment later, riding the still vigorous Saw-Horse; and\r\nhaving unwound a slender golden thread from her girdle the Sorceress\r\nthrew it over the head of the panting and helpless Griffin, and so\r\ndestroyed the magical power of Mombi’s transformation.\r\n\r\nFor the animal, with one fierce shudder, disappeared from view, while\r\nin its place was discovered the form of the old Witch, glaring savagely\r\nat the serene and beautiful face of the Sorceress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image297]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image298]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image299]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrincess Ozma of Oz\r\n\r\n\r\n“You are my prisoner, and it is useless for you to struggle any\r\nlonger,” said Glinda, in her soft, sweet voice. “Lie still a moment,\r\nand rest yourself, and then I will carry you back to my tent.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you seek me?” asked Mombi, still scarce able to speak plainly\r\nfor lack of breath. “What have I done to you, to be so persecuted?”\r\n\r\n“You have done nothing to me,” answered the gentle Sorceress; “but I\r\nsuspect you have been guilty of several wicked actions; and if I find\r\nit is true that you have so abused your knowledge of magic, I intend to\r\npunish you severely.”\r\n\r\n“I defy you!” croaked the old hag. “You dare not harm me!”\r\n\r\nJust then the Gump flew up to them and alighted upon the desert sands\r\nbeside Glinda. Our friends were delighted to find that Mombi had\r\nfinally been captured, and after a hurried consultation it was decided\r\nthey should all return to the camp in the Gump. So the Saw-Horse was\r\ntossed aboard, and then Glinda still holding an end of the golden\r\nthread that was around Mombi’s neck, forced her prisoner to climb into\r\nthe sofas. The others now followed, and Tip gave the word to the Gump\r\nto return.\r\n\r\nThe Journey was made in safety, Mombi sitting in her place with a grim\r\nand sullen air; for the old hag was absolutely helpless so long as the\r\nmagical thread encircled her throat. The army hailed Glinda’s return\r\nwith loud cheers, and the party of friends soon gathered again in the\r\nroyal tent, which had been neatly repaired during their absence.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the Sorceress to Mombi, “I want you to tell us why the\r\nWonderful Wizard of Oz paid you three visits, and what became of the\r\nchild, Ozma, which so curiously disappeared.”\r\n\r\nThe Witch looked at Glinda defiantly, but said not a word.\r\n\r\n“Answer me!” cried the Sorceress.\r\n\r\nBut still Mombi remained silent.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she doesn’t know,” remarked Jack.\r\n\r\n“I beg you will keep quiet,” said Tip. “You might spoil everything with\r\nyour foolishness.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, dear father!” returned the Pumpkinhead, meekly.\r\n\r\n“How glad I am to be a Woggle-Bug!” murmured the Highly Magnified\r\nInsect, softly. “No one can expect wisdom to flow from a pumpkin.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the Scarecrow, “what shall we do to make Mombi speak?\r\nUnless she tells us what we wish to know her capture will do us no good\r\nat all.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose we try kindness,” suggested the Tin Woodman. “I’ve heard that\r\nanyone can be conquered with kindness, no matter how ugly they may be.”\r\n\r\nAt this the Witch turned to glare upon him so horribly that the Tin\r\nWoodman shrank back abashed.\r\n\r\nGlinda had been carefully considering what to do, and now she turned to\r\nMombi and said:\r\n\r\n“You will gain nothing, I assure you, by thus defying us. For I am\r\ndetermined to learn the truth about the girl Ozma, and unless you tell\r\nme all that you know, I will certainly put you to death.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! Don’t do that!” exclaimed the Tin Woodman. “It would be an\r\nawful thing to kill anyone—even old Mombi!”\r\n\r\n“But it is merely a threat,” returned Glinda. “I shall not put Mombi to\r\ndeath, because she will prefer to tell me the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see!” said the tin man, much relieved.\r\n\r\n“Suppose I tell you all that you wish to know,”. said Mombi, speaking\r\nso suddenly that she startled them all. “What will you do with me\r\nthen?”\r\n\r\n“In that case,” replied Glinda, “I shall merely ask you to drink a\r\npowerful draught which will cause you to forget all the magic you have\r\never learned.”\r\n\r\n“Then I would become a helpless old woman!”\r\n\r\n“But you would be alive,” suggested the Pumpkinhead, consolingly.\r\n\r\n“Do try to keep silent!” said Tip, nervously.\r\n\r\n“I’ll try,” responded Jack; “but you will admit that it’s a good thing\r\nto be alive.”\r\n\r\n“Especially if one happens to be Thoroughly Educated,” added the\r\nWoggle-Bug, nodding approval.\r\n\r\n“You may make your choice,” Glinda said to old Mombi, “between death if\r\nyou remain silent, and the loss of your magical powers if you tell me\r\nthe truth. But I think you will prefer to live.”\r\n\r\nMombi cast an uneasy glance at the Sorceress, and saw that she was in\r\nearnest, and not to be trifled with. So she replied, slowly:\r\n\r\n“I will answer your questions.”\r\n\r\n“That is what I expected,” said Glinda, pleasantly. “You have chosen\r\nwisely, I assure you.”\r\n\r\nShe then motioned to one of her Captains, who brought her a beautiful\r\ngolden casket. From this the Sorceress drew an immense white pearl,\r\nattached to a slender chain which she placed around her neck in such a\r\nway that the pearl rested upon her bosom, directly over her heart.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said she, “I will ask my first question: Why did the Wizard pay\r\nyou three visits?”\r\n\r\n“Because I would not come to him,” answered Mombi.\r\n\r\n“That is no answer,” said Glinda, sternly. “Tell me the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” returned Mombi, with downcast eyes, “he visited me to learn the\r\nway I make tea-biscuits.”\r\n\r\n“Look up!” commanded the Sorceress.\r\n\r\nMombi obeyed.\r\n\r\n“What is the color of my pearl?” demanded Glinda.\r\n\r\n“Why—it is black!” replied the old Witch, in a tone of wonder.\r\n\r\n“Then you have told me a falsehood!” cried Glinda, angrily. “Only when\r\nthe truth is spoken will my magic pearl remain a pure white in color.”\r\n\r\nMombi now saw how useless it was to try to deceive the Sorceress; so\r\nshe said, meanwhile scowling at her defeat:\r\n\r\n“The Wizard brought to me the girl Ozma, who was then no more than a\r\nbaby, and begged me to conceal the child.”\r\n\r\n“That is what I thought,” declared Glinda, calmly. “What did he give\r\nyou for thus serving him?”\r\n\r\n“He taught me all the magical tricks he knew. Some were good tricks,\r\nand some were only frauds; but I have remained faithful to my promise.”\r\n\r\n“What did you do with the girl?” asked Glinda; and at this question\r\neveryone bent forward and listened eagerly for the reply.\r\n\r\n“I enchanted her,” answered Mombi.\r\n\r\n“In what way?”\r\n\r\n“I transformed her into—into—”\r\n\r\n“Into what?” demanded Glinda, as the Witch hesitated.\r\n\r\n“_Into a boy!_” said Mombi, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n“A boy!” echoed every voice; and then, because they knew that this old\r\nwoman had reared Tip from childhood, all eyes were turned to where the\r\nboy stood.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the old Witch, nodding her head; “that is the Princess\r\nOzma—the child brought to me by the Wizard who stole her father’s\r\nthrone. That is the rightful ruler of the Emerald City!” and she\r\npointed her long bony finger straight at the boy.\r\n\r\n“I!” cried Tip, in amazement. “Why, I’m no Princess Ozma—I’m not a\r\ngirl!”\r\n\r\nGlinda smiled, and going to Tip she took his small brown hand within\r\nher dainty white one.\r\n\r\n“You are not a girl just now” said she, gently, “because Mombi\r\ntransformed you into a boy. But you were born a girl, and also a\r\nPrincess; so you must resume your proper form, that you may become\r\nQueen of the Emerald City.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, let Jinjur be the Queen!” exclaimed Tip, ready to cry. “I want to\r\nstay a boy, and travel with the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, and the\r\nWoggle-Bug, and Jack—yes! and my friend the Saw-Horse—and the Gump! I\r\ndon’t want to be a girl!”\r\n\r\n“Never mind, old chap,” said the Tin Woodman, soothingly; “it don’t\r\nhurt to be a girl, I’m told; and we will all remain your faithful\r\nfriends just the same. And, to be honest with you, I’ve always\r\nconsidered girls nicer than boys.”\r\n\r\n“They’re just as nice, anyway,” added the Scarecrow, patting Tip\r\naffectionately upon the head.\r\n\r\n“And they are equally good students,” proclaimed the Woggle-Bug. “I\r\nshould like to become your tutor, when you are transformed into a girl\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“But—see here!” said Jack Pumpkinhead, with a gasp: “if you become a\r\ngirl, you can’t be my dear father any more!”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Tip, laughing in spite of his anxiety. “and I shall not\r\nbe sorry to escape the relationship.” Then he added, hesitatingly, as\r\nhe turned to Glinda: “I might try it for awhile,-just to see how it\r\nseems, you know. But if I don’t like being a girl you must promise to\r\nchange me into a boy again.”\r\n\r\n“Really,” said the Sorceress, “that is beyond my magic. I never deal in\r\ntransformations, for they are not honest, and no respectable sorceress\r\nlikes to make things appear to be what they are not. Only unscrupulous\r\nwitches use the art, and therefore I must ask Mombi to effect your\r\nrelease from her charm, and restore you to your proper form. It will be\r\nthe last opportunity she will have to practice magic.”\r\n\r\nNow that the truth about Princes Ozma had been discovered, Mombi did\r\nnot care what became of Tip; but she feared Glinda’s anger, and the boy\r\ngenerously promised to provide for Mombi in her old age if he became\r\nthe ruler of the Emerald City. So the Witch consented to effect the\r\ntransformation, and preparations for the event were at once made.\r\n\r\nGlinda ordered her own royal couch to be placed in the center of the\r\ntent. It was piled high with cushions covered with rose-colored silk,\r\nand from a golden railing above hung many folds of pink gossamer,\r\ncompletely concealing the interior of the couch.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the Witch was to make the boy drink a potion which\r\nquickly sent him into a deep and dreamless sleep. Then the Tin Woodman\r\nand the Woggle-Bug bore him gently to the couch, placed him upon the\r\nsoft cushions, and drew the gossamer hangings to shut him from all\r\nearthly view.\r\n\r\nThe Witch squatted upon the ground and kindled a tiny fire of dried\r\nherbs, which she drew from her bosom. When the blaze shot up and burned\r\nclearly old Mombi scattered a handful of magical powder over the fire,\r\nwhich straightway gave off a rich violet vapor, filling all the tent\r\nwith its fragrance and forcing the Saw-Horse to sneeze—although he had\r\nbeen warned to keep quiet.\r\n\r\nThen, while the others watched her curiously, the hag chanted a\r\nrhythmical verse in words which no one understood, and bent her lean\r\nbody seven times back and forth over the fire. And now the incantation\r\nseemed complete, for the Witch stood upright and cried the one word\r\n“Yeowa!” in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nThe vapor floated away; the atmosphere became, clear again; a whiff of\r\nfresh air filled the tent, and the pink curtains of the couch trembled\r\nslightly, as if stirred from within.\r\n\r\nGlinda walked to the canopy and parted the silken hangings. Then she\r\nbent over the cushions, reached out her hand, and from the couch arose\r\nthe form of a young girl, fresh and beautiful as a May morning. Her\r\neyes sparkled as two diamonds, and her lips were tinted like a\r\ntourmaline. All adown her back floated tresses of ruddy gold, with a\r\nslender jeweled circlet confining them at the brow. Her robes of silken\r\ngauze floated around her like a cloud, and dainty satin slippers shod\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\nAt this exquisite vision Tip’s old comrades stared in wonder for the\r\nspace of a full minute, and then every head bent low in honest\r\nadmiration of the lovely Princess Ozma. The girl herself cast one look\r\ninto Glinda’s bright face, which glowed with pleasure and satisfaction,\r\nand then turned upon the others. Speaking the words with sweet\r\ndiffidence, she said:\r\n\r\n“I hope none of you will care less for me than you did before. I’m just\r\nthe same Tip, you know; only—only—”\r\n\r\n“Only you’re different!” said the Pumpkinhead; and everyone thought it\r\nwas the wisest speech he had ever made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image303]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Riches of Content\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the wonderful tidings reached the ears of Queen Jinjur—how Mombi\r\nthe Witch had been captured; how she had confessed her crime to Glinda;\r\nand how the long-lost Princess Ozma had been discovered in no less a\r\npersonage than the boy Tip—she wept real tears of grief and despair.\r\n\r\n“To think,” she moaned, “that after having ruled as Queen, and lived in\r\na palace, I must go back to scrubbing floors and churning butter again!\r\nIt is too horrible to think of! I will never consent!”\r\n\r\nSo when her soldiers, who spent most of their time making fudge in the\r\npalace kitchens, counseled Jinjur to resist, she listened to their\r\nfoolish prattle and sent a sharp defiance to Glinda the Good and the\r\nPrincess Ozma. The result was a declaration of war, and the very next\r\nday Glinda marched upon the Emerald City with pennants flying and bands\r\nplaying, and a forest of shining spears, sparkling brightly beneath the\r\nsun’s rays.\r\n\r\nBut when it came to the walls this brave assembly made a sudden halt;\r\nfor Jinjur had closed and barred every gateway, and the walls of the\r\nEmerald City were builded high and thick with many blocks of green\r\nmarble. Finding her advance thus baffled, Glinda bent her brows in deep\r\nthought, while the Woggle-Bug said, in his most positive tone:\r\n\r\n“We must lay siege to the city, and starve it into submission. It is\r\nthe only thing we can do.”\r\n\r\n“Not so,” answered the Scarecrow. “We still have the Gump, and the Gump\r\ncan still fly”\r\n\r\nThe Sorceress turned quickly at this speech, and her face now wore a\r\nbright smile.\r\n\r\n“You are right,” she exclaimed, “and certainly have reason to be proud\r\nof your brains. Let us go to the Gump at once!”\r\n\r\nSo they passed through the ranks of the army until they came to the\r\nplace, near the Scarecrow’s tent, where the Gump lay. Glinda and\r\nPrincess Ozma mounted first, and sat upon the sofas. Then the Scarecrow\r\nand his friends climbed aboard, and still there was room for a Captain\r\nand three soldiers, which Glinda considered sufficient for a guard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image305]\r\n\r\nNow, at a word from the Princess, the queer Thing they had called the\r\nGump flopped its palm-leaf wings and rose into the air, carrying the\r\nparty of adventurers high above the walls. They hovered over the\r\npalace, and soon perceived Jinjur reclining in a hammock in the\r\ncourtyard, where she was comfortably reading a novel with a green cover\r\nand eating green chocolates, confident that the walls would protect her\r\nfrom her enemies. Obeying a quick command, the Gump alighted safely in\r\nthis very courtyard, and before Jinjur had time to do more than scream,\r\nthe Captain and three soldiers leaped out and made the former Queen a\r\nprisoner, locking strong chains upon both her wrists.\r\n\r\nThat act really ended the war; for the Army of Revolt submitted as soon\r\nas they knew Jinjur to be a captive, and the Captain marched in safety\r\nthrough the streets and up to the gates of the city, which she threw\r\nwide open. Then the bands played their most stirring music while\r\nGlinda’s army marched into the city, and heralds proclaimed the\r\nconquest of the audacious Jinjur and the accession of the beautiful\r\nPrincess Ozma to the throne of her royal ancestors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image306]\r\n\r\nAt once the men of the Emerald City cast off their aprons. And it is\r\nsaid that the women were so tired eating of their husbands’ cooking\r\nthat they all hailed the conquest of Jinjur with Joy. Certain it is\r\nthat, rushing one and all to the kitchens of their houses, the good\r\nwives prepared so delicious a feast for the weary men that harmony was\r\nimmediately restored in every family.\r\n\r\nOzma’s first act was to oblige the Army of Revolt to return to her\r\nevery emerald or other gem stolen from the public streets and\r\nbuildings; and so great was the number of precious stones picked from\r\ntheir settings by these vain girls, that every one of the royal\r\njewelers worked steadily for more than a month to replace them in their\r\nsettings.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Army of Revolt was disbanded and the girls sent home to\r\ntheir mothers. On promise of good behavior Jinjur was likewise\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nOzma made the loveliest Queen the Emerald City had ever known; and,\r\nalthough she was so young and inexperienced, she ruled her people with\r\nwisdom and Justice. For Glinda gave her good advice on all occasions;\r\nand the Woggle-Bug, who was appointed to the important post of Public\r\nEducator, was quite helpful to Ozma when her royal duties grew\r\nperplexing.\r\n\r\nThe girl, in her gratitude to the Gump for its services, offered the\r\ncreature any reward it might name.\r\n\r\n“Then,” replied the Gump, “please take me to pieces. I did not wish to\r\nbe brought to life, and I am greatly ashamed of my conglomerate\r\npersonality. Once I was a monarch of the forest, as my antlers fully\r\nprove; but now, in my present upholstered condition of servitude, I am\r\ncompelled to fly through the air—my legs being of no use to me\r\nwhatever. Therefore I beg to be dispersed.”\r\n\r\nSo Ozma ordered the Gump taken apart. The antlered head was again hung\r\nover the mantle-piece in the hall, and the sofas were untied and placed\r\nin the reception parlors. The broom tail resumed its accustomed duties\r\nin the kitchen, and finally, the Scarecrow replaced all the\r\nclotheslines and ropes on the pegs from which he had taken them on the\r\neventful day when the Thing was constructed.\r\n\r\nYou might think that was the end of the Gump; and so it was, as a\r\nflying-machine. But the head over the mantle-piece continued to talk\r\nwhenever it took a notion to do so, and it frequently startled, with\r\nits abrupt questions, the people who waited in the hall for an audience\r\nwith the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe Saw-Horse, being Ozma’s personal property, was tenderly cared for;\r\nand often she rode the queer creature along the streets of the Emerald\r\nCity. She had its wooden legs shod with gold, to keep them from wearing\r\nout, and the tinkle of these golden shoes upon the pavement always\r\nfilled the Queen’s subjects with awe as they thought upon this evidence\r\nof her magical powers.\r\n\r\n“The Wonderful Wizard was never so wonderful as Queen Ozma,” the people\r\nsaid to one another, in whispers; “for he claimed to do many things he\r\ncould not do; whereas our new Queen does many things no one would ever\r\nexpect her to accomplish.”\r\n\r\nJack Pumpkinhead remained with Ozma to the end of his days; and he did\r\nnot spoil as soon as he had feared, although he always remained as\r\nstupid as ever. The Woggle-Bug tried to teach him several arts and\r\nsciences; but Jack was so poor a student that any attempt to educate\r\nhim was soon abandoned.\r\n\r\nAfter Glinda’s army had marched back home, and peace was restored to\r\nthe Emerald City, the Tin Woodman announced his intention to return to\r\nhis own Kingdom of the Winkies.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t a very big Kingdom,” said he to Ozma, “but for that very\r\nreason it is easier to rule; and I have called myself an Emperor\r\nbecause I am an Absolute Monarch, and no one interferes in any way with\r\nmy conduct of public or personal affairs. When I get home I shall have\r\na new coat of nickel plate; for I have become somewhat marred and\r\nscratched lately; and then I shall be glad to have you pay me a visit.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” replied Ozma. “Some day I may accept the invitation. But\r\nwhat is to become of the Scarecrow?”\r\n\r\n“I shall return with my friend the Tin Woodman,” said the stuffed one,\r\nseriously. “We have decided never to be parted in the future.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image309]\r\n\r\n“And I have made the Scarecrow my Royal Treasurer,” explained the Tin\r\nWoodman. “For it has occurred to me that it is a good thing to have a\r\nRoyal Treasurer who is made of money. What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I think,” said the little Queen, smiling, “that your friend must be\r\nthe richest man in all the world.”\r\n\r\n“I am,” returned the Scarecrow. “but not on account of my money. For I\r\nconsider brains far superior to money, in every way. You may have\r\nnoticed that if one has money without brains, he cannot use it to\r\nadvantage; but if one has brains without money, they will enable him to\r\nlive comfortably to the end of his days.”\r\n\r\n“At the same time,” declared the Tin Woodman, “you must acknowledge\r\nthat a good heart is a thing that brains can not create, and that money\r\ncan not buy. Perhaps, after all, it is I who am the richest man in all\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\n“You are both rich, my friends,” said Ozma, gently; “and your riches\r\nare the only riches worth having—the riches of content!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image313]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: image318]\r\n\r\n The End",
