This point of view is a healthy\r\nreaction to the over-confident belief that we knew everything about\r\nevolution. There are even those rash enough to think that in the last few\r\nyears we have learned more about evolution than we might have hoped to know\r\na few years ago. A _critique_ therefore not only becomes a criticism of the\r\nolder evidence but an appreciation of the new evidence.\r\n\r\nIn the first lecture an attempt is made to put a new valuation on the\r\ntraditional evidence for evolution. In the second lecture the most recent\r\nwork on heredity is dealt with, for only characters that are inherited can\r\nbecome a part of the evolutionary process. In the third lecture the\r\nphysical basis of heredity and the composition of the germ plasm stream are\r\nexamined in the light of new observations; while in the fourth lecture the\r\nthesis is developed that chance variation combined with a property of\r\nliving things to manifold themselves is the key note of modern evolutionary\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nT.

There is hardly any other scientific term that is used so\r\ncarelessly--to imply so much, to mean so little.\r\n\r\nTHREE KINDS OF EVOLUTION\r\n\r\nWe speak of the evolution of the stars, of the evolution of the horse, of\r\nthe evolution of the steam engine, as though they were all part of the same\r\nprocess. What have they in common? Only this, that each concerns itself\r\nwith the _history_ of something. When the astronomer thinks of the\r\n_evolution_ of the earth, the moon, the sun and the stars, he has a picture\r\nof diffuse matter that has slowly condensed. With condensation came heat;\r\nwith heat, action and reaction within the mass until the chemical\r\nsubstances that we know today were produced. This is the nebular hypothesis\r\nof the astronomer. The astronomer explains, or tries to explain, how this\r\nevolution took place, by an appeal to the physical processes that have been\r\nworked out in the laboratory, processes which he thinks have existed\r\nthrough all the eons during which this evolution was going on and which\r\nwere its immediate causes.\r\n\r\nWhen the biologist thinks of the evolution of animals and plants, a\r\ndifferent picture presents itself. He thinks of series of animals that have\r\nlived in the past, whose bones (fig. 1) and shells have been preserved in\r\nthe rocks. He thinks of these animals as having in the past given birth,\r\nthrough an unbroken succession of individuals, to the living inhabitants of\r\nthe earth today. He thinks that the old, simpler types of the past have in\r\npart changed over into the more complex forms of today.\r\n\r\nHe is thinking as the historian thinks, but he sometimes gets confused and\r\nthinks that he is explaining evolution when he is only describing it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. A series of skulls and feet. Eohippus, Mesohippus,\r\nMeryhippus, Hipparion and Equus. (American Museum of Natural History. After\r\nMatthews.)]\r\n\r\nA third kind of evolution is one for which man himself is responsible, in\r\nthe sense that he has brought it about, often with a definite end in view.\r\n\r\nHis mind has worked slowly from stage to stage. We can often trace the\r\nhistory of the stages through which his psychic processes have passed. The\r\nevolution of the steam-boat, the steam engine, paintings, clothing,\r\ninstruments of agriculture, of manufacture, or of warfare (fig. 2)\r\nillustrates the history of human progress. There is an obvious and striking\r\nsimilarity between the evolution of man's inventions and the evolution of\r\nthe shells of molluscs and of the bones of mammals, yet in neither case\r\ndoes a knowledge of the order in which these things arose explain them. If\r\nwe appeal to the psychologist he will probably tell us that human\r\ninventions are either the result of happy accidents, that have led to an\r\nunforeseen, but discovered use; or else the use of the invention was\r\nforeseen. It is to the latter process more especially that the idea of\r\n_purpose_ is applied. When we come to review the four great lines of\r\nevolutionary thought we shall see that this human idea of purpose recurs in\r\nmany forms, suggesting that man has often tried to explain how organic\r\nevolution has taken place by an appeal to the method which he believes he\r\nmakes use of himself in the inorganic world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Evolution of pole arms. (Metropolitan Museum. After\r\nDean.)]\r\n\r\nWhat has the evolution of the stars, of the horse and of human inventions\r\nin common? Only this, that in each case from a simple beginning through a\r\nseries of changes something more complex, or at least different, has come\r\ninto being. To lump all these kinds of changes into one and call them\r\nevolution is no more than asserting that you believe in consecutive series\r\nof events (which is history) causally connected (which is science); that\r\nis, that you believe in history and that you believe in science. But let us\r\nnot forget that we may have complete faith in both without thereby offering\r\nany explanation of either. It is the business of science to find out\r\n_specifically_ what kinds of events were involved when the stars evolved in\r\nthe sky, when the horse evolved on the earth, and the steam engine was\r\nevolved from the mind of man.\r\n\r\nIs it not rather an empty generalization to say that any kind of change is\r\na process of evolution? At most it means little more than that you want to\r\nintimate that miraculous intervention is not necessary to account for such\r\nkinds of histories.\r\n\r\nWe are concerned here more particularly with the biologists' ideas of\r\nevolution. My intention is to review the evidence on which the old theory\r\nrested its case, in the light of some of the newer evidence of recent\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nFour great branches of study have furnished the evidence of organic\r\nevolution. They are:\r\n\r\n  Comparative anatomy.\r\n  Embryology.\r\n  Paleontology.\r\n  Experimental Breeding or Genetics.\r\n\r\n_The Evidence from Comparative Anatomy_\r\n\r\nWhen we study animals and plants we find that they can be arranged in\r\ngroups according to their resemblances. This is the basis of comparative\r\nanatomy, which is only an accurate study of facts that are superficially\r\nobvious to everyone.\r\n\r\nThe groups are based not on a single difference, but on a very large number\r\nof resemblances. Let us take for example the group of vertebrates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Limb skeletons of extinct and living animals,\r\nshowing the homologous bones: 1, salamander; 2, frog; 3, turtle; 4,\r\nAetosaurus; 5, Pleisiosaurus; 6, Ichthyosaurus; 7, Mesosaurus; 8, duck.\r\n(After Jordan and Kellogg.)]\r\n\r\nThe hand and the arm of man are similar to the hand and arm of the ape. We\r\nfind the same plan in the forefoot of the rat, the elephant, the horse and\r\nthe opossum. We can identify the same parts in the forefoot of the lizard,\r\nthe frog (fig. 3), and even, though less certainly, in the pectoral fins of\r\nfishes. Comparison does not end here. We find similarities in the skull and\r\nback bones of these same animals; in the brain; in the digestive system; in\r\nthe heart and blood vessels; in the muscles.\r\n\r\nEach of these systems is very complex, but the same general arrangement is\r\nfound in all. Anyone familiar with the evidence will, I think, probably\r\nreach the conclusion either that these animals have been created on some\r\npreconceived plan, or else that they have some other bond that unites them;\r\nfor we find it difficult to believe that such complex, yet similar things\r\ncould have arisen independently. But we try to convince our students of the\r\ntruth of the theory of evolution not so much by calling their attention to\r\nthis relation as by tracing each organ from a simple to a complex\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nI have never known such a course to fail in its intention. In fact, I know\r\nthat the student often becomes so thoroughly convinced that he resents any\r\nsuch attempt as that which I am about to make to point out that the\r\nevidence for his conviction is not above criticism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. Drosophila ampelophila. a, Female and b, male.]\r\n\r\nBecause we can often arrange the series of structures in a line extending\r\nfrom the very simple to the more complex, we are apt to become unduly\r\nimpressed by this fact and conclude that if we found the complete series we\r\nshould find all the intermediate steps and that they have arisen in the\r\norder of their complexity. This conclusion is not necessarily correct. Let\r\nme give some examples that have come under my own observation. We have bred\r\nfor five years the wild fruit fly Drosophila ampelophila (fig. 4) and we\r\nhave found over a hundred and twenty-five new types that breed true. Each\r\nhas arisen independently and suddenly. Every part of the body has been\r\naffected by one or another of these mutations. For instance many different\r\nkinds of changes have taken place in the wings and several of these involve\r\nthe size of the wings. If we arrange the latter arbitrarily in the order of\r\ntheir size there will be an almost complete series beginning with the\r\nnormal wings and ending with those of apterous flies. Several of these\r\ntypes are represented in figure 5. The order in which these mutations\r\noccurred bears no relation to their size; each originated independently\r\nfrom the wild type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. Mutants of Drosophila ampelophila arranged in order\r\nof size of wings: (a) cut; (b) beaded; (c) stumpy; (d) another individual\r\nof stumpy; (f) vestigial (g) apterous.]\r\n\r\nThe wings of the wild fly are straight (fig. 4). Several types have arisen\r\nin which the wings are bent upwards and in the most extreme type the wings\r\nare curled over the back, as seen in figure 54 (g), yet there is no\r\nhistorical connection between these stages.\r\n\r\nMutations have occurred involving the pigmentation of the body and wings.\r\nThe head and thorax of the wild Drosophila ampelophila are grayish yellow,\r\nthe abdomen is banded with yellow and black, and the wings are gray. There\r\nhave appeared in our cultures several kinds of darker types ranging to\r\nalmost black flies (fig. 20) and to lighter types that are quite yellow. If\r\nput in line a series may be made from the darkest flies at one end to the\r\nlight yellow flies at the other. These types, with the fluctuations that\r\noccur within each type, furnish a complete series of gradations; yet\r\nhistorically they have arisen independently of each other.\r\n\r\nMany changes in eye color have appeared. As many as thirty or more races\r\ndiffering in eye color are now maintained in our cultures. Some of them are\r\nso similar that they can scarcely be separated from each other. It is\r\neasily possible beginning with the darkest eye color, sepia, which is deep\r\nbrown, to pick out a perfectly graded series ending with pure white eyes.\r\nBut such a serial arrangement would give a totally false idea of the way\r\nthe different types have arisen; and any conclusion based on the existence\r\nof such a series might very well be entirely erroneous, for the fact that\r\nsuch a series exists bears no relation to the order in which its members\r\nhave appeared.\r\n\r\nSuppose that evolution \"in the open\" had taken place in the same way, by\r\nmeans of _discontinuous_ variation. What value then would the evidence from\r\ncomparative anatomy have in so far as it is based on a continuous series of\r\nvariants of any organ?\r\n\r\nNo one familiar with the entire evidence will doubt for a moment that these\r\n125 races of Drosophila ampelophila belong to the same species and have had\r\na common origin, for while they may differ mainly in one thing they are\r\nextremely alike in a hundred other things, and in the general relation of\r\nthe parts to each other.\r\n\r\nIt is in this sense that the evidence from comparative anatomy can be used\r\nI think as an argument for evolution. It is the resemblances that the\r\nanimals or plants in any group have in common that is the basis for such a\r\nconclusion; it is not because we can arrange in a continuous series any\r\nparticular variations. In other words, our inference concerning the common\r\ndescent of two or more species is based on the totality of such\r\nresemblances that still remain in large part after each change has taken\r\nplace. In this sense the argument from comparative anatomy, while not a\r\ndemonstration, carries with it, I think, a high degree of probability.\r\n\r\n_The Evidence from Embryology_\r\n\r\nIn passing from the egg to the adult the individual goes through a series\r\nof changes. In the course of this development we see not only the\r\nbeginnings of the organs that gradually enlarge and change into those of\r\nthe adult animal, but also see that organs appear and later disappear\r\nbefore the adult stage is reached. We find, moreover, that the young\r\nsometimes resemble in a most striking way the adult stage of groups that we\r\nplace lower in the scale of evolution.\r\n\r\nMany years before Darwin advanced his theory of evolution through natural\r\nselection, the resemblance of the young of higher animals to the adults of\r\nlower animals had attracted the attention of zoölogists and various views,\r\noften very naïve, had been advanced to account for the resemblance. Among\r\nthese speculations there was one practically identical with that adopted by\r\nDarwin and the post-Darwinians, namely that the higher animals repeat in\r\ntheir development the _adult stages_ of lower animals. Later this view\r\nbecame one of the cornerstones of the theory of organic evolution. It\r\nreached its climax in the writings of Haeckel, and I think I may add\r\nwithout exaggeration that for twenty-five years it furnished the chief\r\ninspiration of the school of descriptive embryology. Today it is taught in\r\npractically all textbooks of biology. Haeckel called this interpretation\r\nthe Biogenetic Law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Young trout (Trutta fario) six days after hatching.\r\n(After Ziegler.)]\r\n\r\nIt was recognized, of course, that many embryonic stages could not possibly\r\nrepresent ancestral animals. A young fish with a huge yolk sac attached\r\n(fig. 6) could scarcely ever have led a happy, free life as an adult\r\nindividual. Such stages were interpreted, however, as _embryonic_ additions\r\nto the original ancestral type. The embryo had done something on its own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nIn some animals the young have structures that attach them to the mother,\r\nas does the placenta of the mammals. In other cases the young develop\r\nmembranes about themselves--like the amnion of the chick (fig. 7) and\r\nmammal--that would have shut off an adult animal from all intercourse with\r\nthe outside world. Hundreds of such embryonic adaptations are known to\r\nembryologists. These were explained as adaptations and as falsifications of\r\nthe ancestral records.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. Diagram of chick showing relations of amnion,\r\nallantois and yolk. (After Lillie.)]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the last century Weismann injected a new idea into our views\r\nconcerning the origin of variations. He urged that variations are germinal,\r\ni.e. they first appear in the egg and the sperm as changes that later bring\r\nabout modifications in the individual. The idea has been fruitful and is\r\ngenerally accepted by most biologists today. It means that the offspring of\r\na pair of animals are not affected by the structure or the activities of\r\ntheir parents, but the germ plasm is the unmodified stream from which both\r\nthe parent and the young have arisen. Hence their resemblance. Now, it has\r\nbeen found that a variation arising in the germ plasm, no matter what its\r\ncause, may affect any stage in the development of the next individuals that\r\narise from it. There is no reason to suppose that such a change produces a\r\nnew character that always sticks itself, as it were, on to the end of the\r\nold series. This idea of germinal variation therefore carried with it the\r\ndeath of the older conception of evolution by superposition.\r\n\r\nIn more recent times another idea has become current, mainly due to the\r\nwork of Bateson and of de Vries--the idea that variations are\r\ndiscontinuous. Such a conception does not fall easily into line with the\r\nstatement of the biogenetic \"law\"; for actual experience with discontinuous\r\nvariation has taught us that new characters that arise do not add\r\nthemselves to the end of the line of already existing characters but if\r\nthey affect the adult characters they change them without, as it were,\r\npassing through and beyond them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Diagram of head of chick A and B, showing gill\r\nslits, and aortic arches; and head of fish C showing aortic arches. (After\r\nHesse.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. Human embryo showing gill slits and aortic arches.\r\n(After His; from Marshall.)]\r\n\r\nI venture to think that these new ideas and this new evidence have played\r\nhavoc with the biogenetic \"law\". Nevertheless, there is an interpretation\r\nof the facts that is entirely compatible with the theory of evolution. Let\r\nme illustrate this by an example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Young fish, dorsal view, and side view, showing\r\ngill slits. (After Kopsch.)]\r\n\r\nThe embryos of the chick (fig. 8) and of man (fig. 9) possess at an early\r\nstage in their development gill-slits on the sides of the neck like those\r\nof fishes. No one familiar with the relations of the parts will for a\r\nmoment doubt that the gill slits of these embryos and of the fish represent\r\nthe same structures. When we look further into the matter we find that\r\nyoung fish also possess gill slits (fig. 10 and 11)--even in young stages\r\nin their development. Is it not then more probable that the mammal and bird\r\npossess this stage in their development simply because it has never been\r\nlost? Is not this a more reasonable view than to suppose that the gill\r\nslits of the embryos of the higher forms represent the adult gill slits of\r\nthe fish that in some mysterious way have been pushed back into the embryo\r\nof the bird?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. Side views of head of embryo sharks, showing gill\r\nslits.]\r\n\r\nI could give many similar examples. All can be interpreted as embryonic\r\nsurvivals rather than as phyletic contractions. Not one of them calls for\r\nthe latter interpretation.\r\n\r\nThe study of the cleavage pattern of the segmenting egg furnishes the most\r\nconvincing evidence that a different explanation from the one stated in the\r\nbiogenetic law is the more probable explanation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. Cleavage stages of four types of eggs, showing the\r\norigin of the mesenchyme cells (stippled) and mesoderm cells (darker); a,\r\nPlanarian; b, Annelid (Podarke); c, Mollusc (Crepidula), d, Mollusc\r\n(Unio).]\r\n\r\nIt has been found that the cleavage pattern has the same general\r\narrangement in the early stages of flat worms, annelids and molluscs (fig.\r\n12). Obviously these stages have never been adult ancestors, and obviously\r\nif their resemblance has any meaning at all, it is that each group has\r\nretained the same general plan of cleavage, possessed by their common\r\nancestor.\r\n\r\nAccepting this view, let us ask, does the evidence from embryology favor\r\nthe theory of evolution? I think that it does very strongly. The embryos of\r\nthe mammal, bird, and lizard have gill slits today because gill slits were\r\npresent in the embryos of their ancestors. There is no other view that\r\nexplains so well their presence in the higher forms.\r\n\r\nPerhaps someone will say, Well! is not this all that we have contended for!\r\nHave you not reached the old conclusion in a roundabout way? I think not.\r\nTo my mind there is a wide difference between the old statement that the\r\nhigher animals living today have the original adult stages telescoped into\r\ntheir embryos, and the statement that the resemblance between certain\r\ncharacters in the embryos of higher animals and corresponding stages in the\r\nembryos of lower animals is most plausibly explained by the assumption that\r\nthey have descended from the same ancestors, and that their common\r\nstructures are embryonic survivals.\r\n\r\n_The Evidence from Paleontology_\r\n\r\nThe direct evidence furnished by fossil remains is by all odds the\r\nstrongest evidence that we have in favor of organic evolution. Paleontology\r\nholds the incomparable position of being able to point directly to the\r\nevidence showing that the animals and plants living in past times are\r\nconnected with those living at the present time, often through an unbroken\r\nseries of stages. Paleontology has triumphed over the weakness of the\r\nevidence, which Darwin admitted was serious, by filling in many of the\r\nmissing links.\r\n\r\nPaleontology has been criticised on the ground that she cannot pretend to\r\nshow the actual ancestors of living forms because, if in the past genera\r\nand species were as abundant and as diverse as we find them at present, it\r\nis very improbable that the bones of any individual that happened to be\r\npreserved are the bones of just that species that took part in the\r\nevolution. Paleontologists will freely admit that in many cases this is\r\nprobably true, but even then the evidence is, I think, still just as\r\nvaluable and in exactly the same sense as is the evidence from comparative\r\nanatomy. It suffices to know that there lived in the past a particular\r\n\"group\" of animals that had many points in common with those that preceded\r\nthem and with those that came later. Whether these are the actual ancestors\r\nor not does not so much matter, for the view that from such a group of\r\nspecies the later species have been derived is far more probable than any\r\nother view that has been proposed.\r\n\r\nWith this unrivalled material and splendid series of gradations,\r\npaleontology has constructed many stages in the past history of the globe.\r\nBut paleontologists have sometimes gone beyond this descriptive phase of\r\nthe subject and have attempted to formulate the \"causes\", \"laws\" and\r\n\"principles\" that have led to the development of their series. It has even\r\nbeen claimed that paleontologists are in an incomparably better position\r\nthan zoölogists to discover such principles, because they know both the\r\nbeginning and the end of the evolutionary series. The retort is obvious. In\r\nhis sweeping and poetic vision the paleontologist may fail completely to\r\nfind out the nature of the pigments that have gone into the painting of his\r\npicture, and he may confuse a familiarity with the different views he has\r\nenjoyed of the canvas with a knowledge of how the painting is being done.\r\n\r\nMy good friend the paleontologist is in greater danger than he realizes,\r\nwhen he leaves descriptions and attempts explanation. He has no way to\r\ncheck up his speculations and it is notorious that the human mind without\r\ncontrol has a bad habit of wandering.\r\n\r\nWhen the modern student of variation and heredity--the geneticist--looks\r\nover the different \"continuous\" series, from which certain \"laws\" and\r\n\"principles\" have been deduced, he is struck by two facts: that the gaps,\r\nin some cases, are enormous as compared with the single changes with which\r\nhe is familiar, and (what is more important) that they involve numerous\r\nparts in many ways. The geneticist says to the paleontologist, since you do\r\nnot know, and from the nature of your case can never know, whether your\r\ndifferences are due to one change or to a thousand, you can not with\r\ncertainty tell us anything about the hereditary units which have made the\r\nprocess of evolution possible. And without this knowledge there can be no\r\nunderstanding of the causes of evolution.\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR GREAT HISTORICAL SPECULATIONS\r\n\r\nLooking backward over the history of the evolution theory we recognize that\r\nduring the hundred and odd years that have elapsed since Buffon, there have\r\nbeen four main lines of _speculation_ concerning evolution. We might call\r\nthem the four great cosmogonies or the four modern epics of evolution.\r\n\r\nTHE ENVIRONMENT\r\n\r\n_Geoffroy St. Hilaire_\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the last century Geoffroy St. Hilaire, protégé, and\r\nin some respects a disciple of Buffon, was interested as to how living\r\nspecies are related to the animals and plants that had preceded them. He\r\nwas familiar with the kind of change that takes place in the embryo if it\r\nis put into new or changed surroundings, and from this knowledge he\r\nconcluded that as the surface of the earth slowly changed--as the carbon\r\ndioxide contents in the air altered--as land appeared--and as marine\r\nanimals left the water to inhabit it, they or their embryos responded to\r\nthe new conditions and those that responded favorably gave rise to new\r\ncreations. As the environment changed the fauna and flora changed--change\r\nfor change. Here we have a picture of progressive evolution that carries\r\nwith it an idea of mechanical necessity. If there is anything mystical or\r\neven improbable in St. Hilaire's argument it does not appear on the\r\nsurface; for he did not assume that the response to the new environment was\r\nalways a favorable one or, as we say, an adaptation. He expressly stated\r\nthat _if_ the response was unfavorable the individual or the race died out.\r\nHe assumed that _sometimes_ the change might be favorable, i.e., that\r\ncertain species, entire groups, would respond in a direction favorable to\r\ntheir existence in a new environment and these would come to inherit the\r\nearth. In this sense he anticipated certain phases of the natural selection\r\ntheory of Darwin, but only in part; for his picture is not one of strife\r\nwithin and without the species, but rather the escape of the species from\r\nthe old into a new world.\r\n\r\nIf then we recognize the intimate bond in chemical constitution of living\r\nthings and of the world in which they develop, what is there improbable in\r\nSt. Hilaire's hypothesis? Why, in a word is not more credit given to St.\r\nHilaire in modern evolutionary thought? The reasons are to be found, I\r\nthink, first, in that the evidence to which he appealed was meagre and\r\ninconclusive; and, second, in that much of his special evidence does not\r\nseem to us to be applicable. For example the monstrous forms that\r\ndevelopment often assumes in a strange environment, and with which every\r\nembryologist is only too familiar, rarely if ever furnish combinations, as\r\nhe supposed, that are capable of living. On the contrary, they lead rather\r\nto the final catastrophe of the organism. And lastly, St. Hilaire's appeal\r\nto sudden and great transformations, such as a crocodile's egg hatching\r\ninto a bird, has exposed his view to too easy ridicule.\r\n\r\nBut when all is said, St. Hilaire's conception of evolution contains\r\nelements that form the background of our thinking to-day, for taken\r\nbroadly, the interaction between the organism and its environment was a\r\nmechanistic conception of evolution even though the details of the theory\r\nwere inadequate to establish his contention.\r\n\r\nIn our own time the French metaphysician Bergson in his _Evolution\r\nCreatrice_ has proposed in mystical form a thought that has at least a\r\nsuperficial resemblance to St. Hilaire's conception. The response of living\r\nthings is no longer hit in one species and miss in another; it is precise,\r\nexact; yet not mechanical in the sense at least in which we usually employ\r\nthe word mechanical. For Bergson claims that the one chief feature of\r\nliving material is that it responds favorably to the situation in which it\r\nfinds itself; at least so far as lies within the possible physical\r\nlimitations of its organization. Evolution has followed no preordained\r\nplan; it has had no creator; it has brought about its own creation by\r\nresponding adaptively to each situation as it arose.\r\n\r\nBut note: the man of science believes that the organism responds today as\r\nit does, because at present it has a chemical and physical constitution\r\nthat gives this response. We find a specific chemical composition and\r\ngenerally a specific physical structure already existing. We have no reason\r\nto suppose that such particular reactions would take place until a specific\r\nchemical configuration had been acquired. Where did this constitution come\r\nfrom? This is the question that the scientist asks himself. I suppose\r\nBergson would have to reply that it came into existence at the moment that\r\nthe first specific stimulus was applied. But if this is the answer we have\r\npassed at once from the realm of observation to the realm of fancy--to a\r\nrealm that is foreign to our experience; for such a view assumes that\r\nchemical and physical reactions are guided by the needs of the organism\r\nwhen the reactions take place inside living beings.\r\n\r\nUSE AND DISUSE\r\n\r\n_From Lamarck to Weismann_\r\n\r\nThe second of the four great historical explanations appeals to a change\r\nnot immediately connected with the outer world, but to one within the\r\norganism itself.\r\n\r\nPractice makes perfect is a familiar adage. Not only in human affairs do we\r\nfind that a part through use becomes a better tool for performing its task,\r\nand through disuse degenerates; but in the field of animal behavior we find\r\nthat many of the most essential types of behavior have been learned through\r\nrepeated associations formed by contact with the outside.\r\n\r\nIt was not so long ago that we were taught that the instincts of animals\r\nare the inherited experience of their ancestors--lapsed intelligence was\r\nthe current phrase.\r\n\r\nLamarck's name is always associated with the application of the theory of\r\nthe inheritance of acquired characters. Darwin fully endorsed this view and\r\nmade use of it as an explanation in all of his writings about animals.\r\nToday the theory has few followers amongst trained investigators, but it\r\nstill has a popular vogue that is widespread and vociferous.\r\n\r\nTo Weismann more than to any other single individual should be ascribed the\r\ndisfavor into which this view has fallen. In a series of brilliant essays\r\nhe laid bare the inadequacy of the supposed evidence on which the\r\ninheritance of acquired characters rested. Your neighbor's cat, for\r\ninstance, has a short tail, and it is said that it had its tail pinched off\r\nby a closing door. In its litter of kittens one or more is found without a\r\ntail. Your neighbor believes that here is a case of cause and effect. He\r\nmay even have known that the mother and grandmother of the cat had natural\r\ntails. But it has been found that short tail is a dominant character;\r\ntherefore, until we know who was the father of the short-tailed kittens the\r\naccident to its mother and the normal condition of her maternal ancestry is\r\nnot to the point.\r\n\r\nWeismann appealed to common sense. He made few experiments to disprove\r\nLamarck's hypothesis. True, he cut off the tails of some mice for a few\r\ngenerations but got no tailless offspring and while he gives no exact\r\nmeasurements with coefficients of error he did not observe that the tails\r\nof the descendants had shortened one whit. The combs of fighting cocks and\r\nthe tails of certain breeds of sheep have been cropped for many generations\r\nand the practice continues today, because their tails are still long. While\r\nin Lamarck's time there was no evidence opposed to his ingenious theory,\r\nbased as it was on an appeal to the acknowledged facts of improvement that\r\ntake place in the organs of an individual through their own functioning (a\r\nfact that is as obvious and remarkable today as in the time of Lamarck),\r\nyet now there is evidence as to whether the effects of use and disuse are\r\ninherited, and this evidence is not in accord with Lamarck's doctrine.\r\n\r\nTHE UNFOLDING PRINCIPLE\r\n\r\n_Nägeli and Bateson_\r\n\r\nI have ventured to put down as one of the four great historical\r\nexplanations, under the heading of the unfolding principle, a conception\r\nthat has taken protean forms. At one extreme it is little more than a\r\nmystic sentiment to the effect that evolution is the result of an inner\r\ndriving force or principle which goes under many names such as\r\nBildungstrieb, nisus formativus, vital force, and orthogenesis.\r\nEvolutionary thought is replete with variants of this idea, often naïvely\r\nexpressed, sometimes unconsciously implied. Evolution once meant, in fact,\r\nan unfolding of what pre-existed in the egg, and the term still carries\r\nwith it something of its original significance.\r\n\r\nNägeli's speculation written several years after Darwin's \"Origin of\r\nSpecies\" may be taken as a typical case. Nägeli thought that there exists\r\nin living material an innate power to grow and expand. He vehemently\r\nprotested that he meant only a mechanical principle but as he failed to\r\nrefer such a principle to any properties of matter known to physicists and\r\nchemists his view seems still a mysterious affirmation, as difficult to\r\nunderstand as the facts themselves which it purports to explain.\r\n\r\nNägeli compared the process of evolution to the growth of a tree, whose\r\nultimate twigs represent the living world of species. Natural selection\r\nplays only the rôle of the gardener who prunes the tree into this or that\r\nshape but who has himself _produced_ nothing. As an imaginative figure of\r\nspeech Nägeli's comparison of the tree might even today seem to hold if we\r\nsubstituted \"mutations\" for \"growth\", but although we know so little about\r\nwhat causes mutations there is no reason for supposing them to be due to an\r\ninner impulse, and hence they furnish no justification for such a\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nIn his recent presidential address before the British Association Bateson\r\nhas inverted this idea. I suspect that his effort was intended as little\r\nmore than a _tour de force_. He claims for it no more than that it is a\r\npossible line of speculation. Perhaps he thought the time had come to give\r\na shock to our too confident views concerning evolution. Be this as it may,\r\nhe has invented a striking paradox. Evolution has taken place through the\r\nsteady loss of inhibiting factors. Living matter was stopped down, so to\r\nspeak, at the beginning of the world. As the stops are lost, new things\r\nemerge. Living matter has changed only in that it has become simpler.\r\n\r\nNATURAL SELECTION\r\n\r\n_Darwin_\r\n\r\nOf the four great historical speculations about evolution, the doctrine of\r\nNatural Selection of Darwin and Wallace has met with the most widespread\r\nacceptance. In the last lecture I intend to examine this theory critically.\r\nHere we are concerned only with its broadest aspects.\r\n\r\nDarwin appealed to _chance variations_ as supplying evolution with the\r\nmaterial on which natural selection works. If we accept, for the moment,\r\nthis statement as the cardinal doctrine of natural selection it may appear\r\nthat evolution is due, (1) _not_ to an _orderly_ response of the organism\r\nto its environment, (2) _not_ in the main to the activities of the animal\r\nthrough the use or disuse of its parts, (3) _not_ to any innate principle\r\nof living material itself, and (4) above all _not_ to purpose either from\r\nwithin or from without. Darwin made quite clear what he meant by chance. By\r\nchance he did not mean that the variations were not causal. On the contrary\r\nhe taught that in Science we mean by chance only that the particular\r\ncombination of causes that bring about a variation are not known. They are\r\naccidents, it is true, but they are causal accidents.\r\n\r\nIn his famous book on \"Animals and Plants under Domestication\", Darwin\r\ndwells at great length on the nature of the conditions that bring about\r\nvariations. If his views seem to us today at times vague, at times\r\nproblematical, and often without a secure basis, nevertheless we find in\r\nevery instance, that Darwin was searching for the _physical causes of\r\nvariation_. He brought, in consequence, conviction to many minds that there\r\nare abundant indications, even if certain proof is lacking, that the causes\r\nof variation are to be found in natural processes.\r\n\r\nToday the belief that evolution takes place by means of natural processes\r\nis generally accepted. It does not seem probable that we shall ever again\r\nhave to renew the old contest between evolution and special creation.\r\n\r\nBut this is not enough. We can never remain satisfied with a negative\r\nconclusion of this kind. We must find out what natural causes bring about\r\nvariations in animals and plants; and we must also find out what kinds of\r\nvariations are inherited, and how they are inherited. If the circumstantial\r\nevidence for organic evolution, furnished by comparative anatomy,\r\nembryology and paleontology is cogent, we should be able to observe\r\nevolution going on at the present time, i.e. we should be able to observe\r\nthe occurrence of variations and their transmission. This has actually been\r\ndone by the geneticist in the study of mutations and Mendelian heredity, as\r\nthe succeeding lectures will show.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE BEARING OF MENDEL'S DISCOVERY ON THE ORIGIN OF HEREDITARY CHARACTERS\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1857 and 1868 Gregor Mendel, Augustinian monk, studied\r\nthe heredity of certain characters of the common edible pea, in the garden\r\nof the monastery at Brünn.\r\n\r\nIn his account of his work written in 1868, he said:\r\n\r\n    \"It requires indeed some courage to undertake a labor of such a\r\n    far-reaching extent; it appears, however, to be the only right way by\r\n    which we can finally reach the solution of a question the importance of\r\n    which cannot be over-estimated in connection with the history of the\r\n    evolution of organic forms.\"\r\n\r\nHe tells us also why he selected peas for his work:\r\n\r\n    \"The selection of the plant group which shall serve for experiments of\r\n    this kind must be made with all possible care if it be desired to avoid\r\n    from the outset every risk of questionable results.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The experimental plants must necessarily\r\n\r\n    1. Possess constant differentiating characters.\r\n\r\n    2. The hybrids of such plants must, during the flowering period, be\r\n    protected from the influence of all foreign pollen, or be easily\r\n    capable of such protection.\"\r\n\r\nWhy do biologists throughout the world to-day agree that Mendel's discovery\r\nis one of first rank?\r\n\r\nA great deal might be said in this connection. What is essential may be\r\nsaid in a few words. Biology had been, and is still, largely a descriptive\r\nand speculative science. _Mendel showed by experimental proof that heredity\r\ncould be explained by a simple mechanism. His discovery has been\r\nexceedingly fruitful._\r\n\r\nScience begins with naïve, often mystic conceptions of its problems. It\r\nreaches its goal whenever it can replace its early guessing by verifiable\r\nhypotheses and predictable results. This is what Mendel's law did for\r\nheredity.\r\n\r\nMENDEL'S FIRST DISCOVERY--SEGREGATION\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. Diagram illustrating a cross between a red (dark)\r\nand a white variety of four o'clock (Mirabilis jalapa).]\r\n\r\nLet us turn to the demonstration of his first law--the law of segregation.\r\nThe first case I choose is not the one given by Mendel but one worked out\r\nlater by Correns. If the common garden plant called four o'clock (Mirabilis\r\njalapa) with red flowers is crossed to one having white flowers, the\r\noffspring are pink (fig. 13). The hybrid, then, is intermediate in the\r\ncolor of its flowers between the two parents. If these hybrids are inbred\r\nthe offspring are white, pink and red, in the proportion of 1:2:1. All of\r\nthese had the same ancestry, yet they are of three different kinds. If we\r\ndid not know their history it would be quite impossible to state what the\r\nancestry of the white or of the red had been, for they might just as well\r\nhave come from pure white and pure red ancestors respectively as to have\r\nemerged from the pink hybrids. Moreover, when we test them we find that\r\nthey are as pure as are white or red flowering plants that have had all\r\nwhite or all red flowering ancestors.\r\n\r\nMendel's Law explains the results of this cross as shown in figure 14.\r\n\r\nThe egg cell from the white parent carries the factor for white, the pollen\r\ncell from the red parent carries the factor for red. The hybrid formed by\r\ntheir union carries both factors. The result of their combined action is to\r\nproduce flowers intermediate in color.\r\n\r\nWhen the hybrids mature and their germ cells (eggs or pollen) ripen, each\r\ncarries only one of these factors, either the red or the white, but not\r\nboth. In other words, the two factors that have been brought together in\r\nthe hybrid separate in its germ cells. Half of the egg cells are white\r\nbearing, half red bearing. Half of the pollen cells are white bearing, half\r\nred bearing. Chance combinations at fertilization give the three classes of\r\nindividuals of the second generation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. Diagram illustrating the history of the factors in\r\nthe germ cells of the cross shown in Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\nThe white flowering plants should forever breed true, as in fact they do.\r\nThe red flowering plants also breed true. The pink flowering plants, having\r\nthe same composition as the hybrids of the first generation, should give\r\nthe same kind of result. They do, indeed, give this result i.e. one white\r\nto two pink to one red flowered offspring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. Diagram illustrating a cross between special races\r\nof white and black fowls, producing the blue (here gray) Andalusian.]\r\n\r\nAnother case of the same kind is known to breeders of poultry. One of the\r\nmost beautiful of the domesticated breeds is known as the Andalusian. It is\r\na slate blue bird shading into blue-black on the neck and back. Breeders\r\nknow that these blue birds do not breed true but produce white, black, and\r\nblue offspring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. Diagram showing history of germ cells of cross of\r\nFig. 15. The larger circles indicate the color of the birds; their enclosed\r\nsmall circles the nature of the factors in the germ cells of such birds.]\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the failure to produce a pure race of Andalusians is\r\nthat they are like the pink flowers of the four o'clock, i.e., they are a\r\nhybrid type formed by the meeting of the white and the black germ cells. If\r\nthe whites produced by the Andalusians are bred to the blacks (both being\r\npure strains), all the offspring will be blue (fig. 15); if these blues are\r\ninbred they will give 1 white, to 2 blues, to 1 black. In other words, the\r\nfactor for white and the factor for black separate in the germ cells of the\r\nhybrid Andalusian birds (fig. 16).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. Diagram of Mendel's cross between yellow (dominant)\r\nand green (recessive) peas.]\r\n\r\nThe third case is Mendel's classical case of yellow and green peas (fig.\r\n17). He crossed a plant belonging to a race having yellow peas with one\r\nhaving green peas. The hybrid plants had yellow seeds. These hybrids inbred\r\ngave three yellows to one green. The explanation (fig. 18) is the same in\r\nprinciple as in the preceding cases. The only difference between them is\r\nthat the hybrid which contains both the yellow and the green factors is in\r\nappearance not intermediate, but like the yellow parent stock. Yellow is\r\nsaid therefore to be dominant and green to be recessive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. Diagram illustrating the history of the factors in\r\nthe cross shown in Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\nAnother example where one of the contrasted characters is dominant is shown\r\nby the cross of Drosophila with vestigial wings to the wild type with long\r\nwings (fig. 19). The F_1 flies have long wings not differing from those of\r\nthe wild fly, so far as can be observed. When two such flies are inbred\r\nthere result three long to one vestigial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. Diagram illustrating a cross between a fly\r\n(Drosophila ampelophila) with long wings and a mutant fly with vestigial\r\nwings.]\r\n\r\nThe question as to whether a given character is dominant or recessive is a\r\nmatter of no theoretical importance for the principle of segregation,\r\nalthough from the notoriety given to it one might easily be misled into the\r\nerroneous supposition that it was the discovery of this relation that is\r\nMendel's crowning achievement.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate by an example in which the hybrid standing between two\r\ntypes overlaps them both. There are two mutant races in our cultures of the\r\nfruit fly Drosophila that have dark body color, one called sooty, another\r\nwhich is even blacker, called ebony (fig. 20). Sooty crossed to ebony gives\r\noffspring that are intermediate in color. Some of them are so much like\r\nsooty that they cannot be distinguished from sooty. At the other extreme\r\nsome of the hybrids are as dark as the lightest of the ebony flies. If\r\nthese hybrids are inbred there is a continuous series of individuals,\r\nsooties, intermediates and ebonies. Which color here shall we call the\r\ndominant? If the ebony, then in the second generation we count three\r\nebonies to one sooty, putting the hybrids with the ebonies. If the dominant\r\nis the sooty then we count three sooties to one ebony, putting the hybrids\r\nwith the sooties. The important fact to find out is whether there actually\r\nexist three classes in the second generation. This can be ascertained even\r\nwhen, as in this case, there is a perfectly graded series from one end to\r\nthe other, by testing out individually enough of the flies to show that\r\none-fourth of them never produce any descendants but ebonies, one-fourth\r\nnever any but sooties, and one-half of them give rise to both ebony and\r\nsooty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. Cross between two allelomorphic races of\r\nDrosophila, sooty and ebony, that give a completely graded series in F_2.]\r\n\r\nMENDEL'S SECOND DISCOVERY--INDEPENDENT ASSORTMENT\r\n\r\nBesides his discovery that there are pairs of characters that disjoin, as\r\nit were, in the germ cells of the hybrid (law of segregation) Mendel made a\r\nsecond discovery which also has far-reaching consequences. The following\r\ncase illustrates Mendel's second law.\r\n\r\nIf a pea that is yellow and round is crossed to one that is green and\r\nwrinkled (fig. 21), all of the offspring are yellow and round. Inbred,\r\nthese give 9 yellow round, 3 green round, 3 yellow wrinkled, 1 green\r\nwrinkled. All the yellows taken together are to the green as 3:1. All the\r\nround taken together are to the wrinkled as three to one; but some of the\r\nyellows are now wrinkled and some of the green are now round. There has\r\nbeen a recombination of characters, while at the same time the results, for\r\neach pair of characters taken separately, are in accord with Mendel's Law\r\nof Segregation, (fig. 22). The second law of Mendel may be called the law\r\nof independent assortment of different character pairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. Cross between yellow-round and green-wrinkled peas,\r\ngiving the 9: 3: 3: 1 ratio in F_2.]\r\n\r\nWe can, as it were, take the characters of one organism and recombine them\r\nwith those of a different organism. We can explain this result as due to\r\nthe assortment of factors for these characters in the germ cells according\r\nto a definite law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. Diagram to show the history of the factor pairs\r\nyellow-green and round-wrinkled of the cross in Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\nAs a second illustration let me take the classic case of the combs of\r\nfowls. If a bird with a rose comb is bred to one with a pea comb (fig. 23),\r\nthe offspring have a comb different from either. It is called a walnut\r\ncomb. If two such individuals are bred they give 9 walnut, 3 rose, 3 pea, 1\r\nsingle. This proportion shows that the grandparental types differed in\r\nrespect to two pairs of characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. Cross between pea and rose combed fowls. (Charts of\r\nBaur and Goldschmidt.)]\r\n\r\nA fourth case is shown in the fruit fly, where an ebony fly with long wings\r\nis mated to a grey fly with vestigial wings (fig. 24). The offspring are\r\ngray with long wings. If these are inbred they give 9 gray long, 3 gray\r\nvestigial, 3 ebony long, 1 ebony vestigial (figs. 24 and 25).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. Cross between long ebony and gray vestigial flies.]\r\n\r\nThe possibility of interchanging characters might be illustrated over and\r\nover again. It is true not only when two pairs of characters are involved,\r\nbut when three, four, or more enter the cross.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. Diagram to show the history of the factors in the\r\ncross shown in Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\nIt is as though we took individuals apart and put together parts of two,\r\nthree or more individuals by substituting one part for another.\r\n\r\nNot only has this power to make whatever combinations we choose great\r\npractical importance, it has even greater theoretical significance; for, it\r\nfollows that the individual is not in itself the unit in heredity, but that\r\nwithin the germ-cells there exist smaller units concerned with the\r\ntransmission of characters.\r\n\r\nThe older mystical statement of the individual as a unit in heredity has no\r\nlonger any interest in the light of these discoveries, except as a past\r\nphase of biological history. We see, too, more clearly that the sorting out\r\nof factors in the germ plasm is a very different process from the influence\r\nof these factors on the development of the organism. There is today no\r\nexcuse for confusing these two problems.\r\n\r\nIf mechanistic principles apply also to embryonic development then the\r\ncourse of development is capable of being stated as a series of\r\nchemico-physical reactions and the \"_individual_\" is merely a term to\r\nexpress the sum total of such reactions and should not be interpreted as\r\nsomething different from or more than these reactions. So long as so little\r\nis known of the actual processes involved in development the use of the\r\nterm \"individuality\", while giving the appearance of profundity, in reality\r\noften serves merely to cover ignorance and to make a mystery out of a\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS OF WILD ANIMALS AND PLANTS FOLLOW THE SAME LAWS OF\r\nINHERITANCE AS DO THE CHARACTERS OF DOMESTICATED ANIMALS AND PLANTS.\r\n\r\nDarwin based many of his conclusions concerning variation and heredity on\r\nthe evidence derived from the garden and from the stock farm. Here he was\r\nhandicapped to some extent, for he had at times to rely on information much\r\nof which was uncritical, and some of which was worthless.\r\n\r\nToday we are at least better informed on _two_ important points; one\r\nconcerning the _kinds_ of variations that furnish to the cultivator the\r\nmaterials for his selection; the other concerning the modes of inheritance\r\nof these variations. We know now that new characters are continually\r\nappearing in domesticated as well as in wild animals and plants, that these\r\ncharacters are often sharply marked off from the original characters, and\r\nwhether the differences are great or whether they are small they are\r\ntransmitted alike according to Mendel's law.\r\n\r\nMany of the characteristics of our domesticated animals and cultivated\r\nplants originated long ago, and only here and there have the records of\r\ntheir first appearance been preserved. In only a few instances are these\r\nrecords clear and definite, while the complete history of any large group\r\nof our domesticated products is unknown to us.\r\n\r\nWithin the last five or six years, however, from a common wild species of\r\nfly, the fruit fly, Drosophila ampelophila, which we have brought into the\r\nlaboratory, have arisen over a hundred and twenty-five new types whose\r\norigin is completely known. Let me call attention to a few of the more\r\ninteresting of these types and their modes of inheritance, comparing them\r\nwith wild types in order to show that the kinds of inheritance found in\r\ndomesticated races occur also in wild types. The results will show beyond\r\ndispute that the characters of wild types are inherited in precisely the\r\nsame way as are the characters of the mutant types--a fact that is not\r\ngenerally appreciated except by students of genetics, although it is of the\r\nmost far-reaching significance for the theory of evolution.\r\n\r\nA mutant appeared in which the eye color of the female was different from\r\nthat of the male. The eye color of the mutant female is a dark eosin color,\r\nthat of the male yellowish eosin. From the beginning this difference was as\r\nmarked as it is to-day. Breeding experiments show that eosin eye color\r\ndiffers from the red color of the eye of the wild fly by a single mutant\r\nfactor. Here then at a single step a type appeared that was sexually\r\ndimorphic.\r\n\r\nZoölogists know that sexual dimorphism is not uncommon in wild species of\r\nanimals, and Darwin proposed the theory of sexual selection to account for\r\nthe difference between the sexes. He assumed that the male preferred\r\ncertain kinds of females differing from himself in a particular character,\r\nand thus in time through sexual selection, the sexes came to differ from\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. Clover butterfly (Colias philodice) with two types\r\nof females, above; and one type of male, below.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of eosin eye color no such process as that postulated by Darwin\r\nto account for the differences between the sexes was involved; for the\r\nsingle mutation that brought about the change also brought in the\r\ndimorphism with it.\r\n\r\nIn recent years zoölogists have carefully studied several cases in which\r\ntwo types of female are found in the same species. In the common clover\r\nbutterfly, there is a yellow and a white type of female, while the male is\r\nyellow (fig. 26). It has been shown that a single factor difference\r\ndetermines whether the female is yellow or white. The inheritance is,\r\naccording to Gerould, strictly Mendelian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. Papilio turnus with two types of females above and\r\none type of male below.]\r\n\r\nIn Papilio turnus there exist, in the southern states, two kinds of\r\nfemales, one yellow like the male, one black (fig. 27). The evidence here\r\nis not so certain, but it seems probable that a single factor difference\r\ndetermines whether the female shall be yellow or black.\r\n\r\nFinally in Papilio polytes of Ceylon and India three different types of\r\nfemales appear, (fig. 28 to right) only one of which is like the male. Here\r\nthe analysis of the breeding data shows the possibility of explaining this\r\ncase as due to two pairs Mendelian factors which give in combination the\r\nthree types of female.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. Papilio polytes, with three types of female to\r\nright and one type of male above to left.]\r\n\r\nTaking these cases together, they furnish a much simpler explanation than\r\nthe one proposed by Darwin. They show also that characters like these shown\r\nby wild species may follow Mendel's law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. Mutant race of fruit fly with intercalated\r\nduplicate mesothorax on dorsal side.]\r\n\r\nThere has appeared in our cultures a fly in which the third division of the\r\nthorax with its appendages has changed into a segment like the second (fig.\r\n29). It is smaller than the normal mesothorax and its wings are imperfectly\r\ndeveloped, but the bristles on the upper surface may have the typical\r\narrangement of the normal mesothorax. The mutant shows how great a change\r\nmay result from a single factor difference.\r\n\r\nA factor that causes duplication in the legs has also been found. Here the\r\ninteresting fact was discovered (Hoge) that duplication takes place only in\r\nthe cold. At ordinary temperatures the legs are normal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. Mutant race of fruit fly, called eyeless; a, a'\r\nnormal eye.]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the last case, where a character is doubled, is the next one\r\nin which the eyes are lost (fig. 30). This change also took place at a\r\nsingle step. All the flies of this stock however, cannot be said to be\r\neyeless, since many of them show pieces of the eye--indeed the variation is\r\nso wide that the eye may even appear like a normal eye unless carefully\r\nexamined. Formerly we were taught that eyeless animals arose in caves. This\r\ncase shows that they may also arise suddenly in glass milk bottles, by a\r\nchange in a single factor.\r\n\r\nI may recall in this connection that wingless flies (fig. 5 f) also arose\r\nin our cultures by a single mutation. We used to be told that wingless\r\ninsects occurred on desert islands because those insects that had the best\r\ndeveloped wings had been blown out to sea. Whether this is true or not, I\r\nwill not pretend to say, but at any rate wingless insects may also arise,\r\nnot through a slow process of elimination, but at a single step.\r\n\r\nThe preceding examples have all related to recessive characters. The next\r\none is dominant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. Mutant race of fruit fly called bar to the right\r\n(normal to the left). The eye is a narrow vertical bar, the outline of the\r\noriginal eye is indicated.]\r\n\r\nA single male appeared with a narrow vertical red bar (fig. 31) instead of\r\nthe broad red oval eye. Bred to wild females the new character was found to\r\ndominate, at least to the extent that the eyes of all its offspring were\r\nnarrower than the normal eye, although not so narrow as the eye of the pure\r\nstock. Around the bar there is a wide border that corresponds to the region\r\noccupied by the rest of the eye of the wild fly. It lacks however the\r\nelements of the eye. It is therefore to be looked upon as a rudimentary\r\norgan, which is, so to speak, a by-product of the dominant mutation.\r\n\r\nThe preceding cases have all involved rather great changes in some one\r\norgan of the body. The following three cases involve slight changes, and\r\nyet follow the same laws of inheritance as do the larger changes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. Mutant race of fruit fly, called speck. There is a\r\nminute black speck at base of wing.]\r\n\r\nAt the base of the wings a minute black speck appeared (fig. 32). It was\r\nfound to be a Mendelian character. In another case the spines on the thorax\r\nbecame forked or kinky (fig. 52b). This stock breeds true, and the\r\ncharacter is inherited in strictly Mendelian fashion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. Mutant race of fruit fly called club. The wings\r\noften remain unexpanded and two bristles present in wild fly (b) are absent\r\non side of thorax (c).]\r\n\r\nIn a certain stock a number of flies appeared in which the wing pads did\r\nnot expand (fig. 33). It was found that this peculiarity is shown in only\r\nabout twenty per cent of the individuals supposed to inherit it. Later it\r\nwas found that this stock lacked two bristles on the sides of the thorax.\r\nBy means of this knowledge the heredity of the character was easily\r\ndetermined. It appears that while the expansion of the wing pads fails to\r\noccur once in five times--probably because it is an environmental effect\r\npeculiar to this stock,--yet the minute difference of the presence or\r\nabsence of the two lateral bristles is a constant feature of the flies that\r\ncarry this particular factor.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding cases I have spoken as though a factor influenced only one\r\npart of the body. It would have been more accurate to have stated that the\r\n_chief_ effect of the factor was observed in a particular part of the body.\r\nMost students of genetics realize that a factor difference usually affects\r\nmore than a single character. For example, a mutant stock called\r\nrudimentary wings has as its principle characteristic very short wings\r\n(fig. 34). But the factor for rudimentary wings also produces other effects\r\nas well. The females are almost completely sterile, while the males are\r\nfertile. The viability of the stock is poor. When flies with rudimentary\r\nwings are put into competition with wild flies relatively few of the\r\nrudimentary flies come through, especially if the culture is crowded. The\r\nhind legs are also shortened. All of these effects are the results of a\r\nsingle factor-difference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. Mutant race of fruit fly, called rudimentary.]\r\n\r\nOne may venture the guess that some of the specific and varietal\r\ndifferences that are characteristic of wild types and which at the same\r\ntime appear to have no survival value, are only by-products of factors\r\nwhose most important effect is on another part of the organism where their\r\ninfluence is of vital importance.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that systematists make use of characters that are constant\r\nfor groups of species, but which do not appear in themselves to have an\r\nadaptive significance. If we may suppose that the constancy of such\r\ncharacters may be only an index of the presence of a factor whose _chief_\r\ninfluence is in some other direction or directions, some physiological\r\ninfluence, for example, we can give at least a reasonable explanation of\r\nthe constancy of such characters.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that an overstatement to the effect that each factor\r\nmay affect the entire body, is less likely to do harm than to state that\r\neach factor affects only a particular character. The reckless use of the\r\nphrase \"unit character\" has done much to mislead the uninitiated as to the\r\neffects that a single change in the germ plasm may produce on the organism.\r\nFortunately, the expression \"unit character\" is being less used by those\r\nstudents of genetics who are more careful in regard to the implications of\r\ntheir terminology.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of cases of inheritance, due to the XY chromosomes, that\r\nis called sex linked inheritance. It is shown both by mutant characters and\r\ncharacters of wild species.\r\n\r\nFor instance, white eye color in Drosophila shows sex linked inheritance.\r\nIf a white eyed male is mated to a wild red eyed female (fig. 35) all the\r\noffspring have red eyes. If these are inbred, there are three red to one\r\nwhite eyed offspring, but white eyes occur only in the males. The\r\ngrandfather has transmitted his peculiarity to half of his grandsons, but\r\nto none of his granddaughters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. Diagram showing a cross between a white eyed male\r\nand a red eyed female of the fruit fly. Sex linked inheritance.]\r\n\r\nThe reciprocal cross (fig. 36) is also interesting. If a white eyed female\r\nis bred to a red eyed male, all of the daughters have red eyes and all of\r\nthe sons have white eyes. We call this criss-cross inheritance. If these\r\noffspring are inbred, they produce equal numbers of red eyed and white eyed\r\nfemales and equal numbers of red eyed and white eyed males. The ratio is 1:\r\n1: 1: 1, or ignoring sex, 2 reds to 2 whites, and not the usual 3:1\r\nMendelian ratio. Yet, as will be shown later, the result is in entire\r\naccord with Mendel's principle of segregation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36. Diagram illustrating a cross between a red eyed\r\nmale and white eyed female of the fruit fly (reciprocal cross of that shown\r\nin Fig. 35).]\r\n\r\nIt has been shown by Sturtevant that in a wild species of Drosophila, viz.,\r\nD. repleta, two varieties of individuals exist, in one of which the thorax\r\nhas large splotches and in the other type smaller splotches (fig. 37). The\r\nfactors that differentiate these varieties are sex linked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37. Two types of markings on thorax of Drosophila\r\nrepleta, both found \"wild\". They show sex linked inheritance.]\r\n\r\nCertain types of color blindness (fig. 38) and certain other abnormal\r\nconditions in man such as haemophilia, are transmitted as sex linked\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38, A. Diagram illustrating inheritance of color\r\nblindness in man; the iris of the color-blind eye is here black.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38, B. Reciprocal of cross in Fig. 38 a.]\r\n\r\nIn domestic fowls sex linked inheritance has been found as the\r\ncharacteristic method of transmission for at least as many as six\r\ncharacters, but here the relation of the sexes is in a sense reversed. For\r\ninstance, if a black Langshan hen is crossed to a barred Plymouth Rock cock\r\n(fig. 39), the offspring are all barred. If these are inbred half of the\r\ndaughters are black and half are barred; all of the sons are barred. The\r\ngrandmother has transmitted her color to half of her granddaughters but to\r\nnone of her grandsons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39. Sex-linked inheritance in domesticated birds shown\r\nhere in a cross between barred Plymouth Rock male and black Langshan\r\nfemale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40. Reciprocal of Fig. 39.]\r\n\r\nIn the reciprocal cross (fig. 40) black cock by barred hen, the daughters\r\nare black and the sons barred--criss-cross inheritance. These inbred give\r\nblack hens and black cocks, barred hens and barred cocks.\r\n\r\nThere is a case comparable to this found in a wild species of moth, Abraxas\r\ngrossulariata. A wild variation of this type is lighter in color and is\r\nknown as A. lacticolor. When these two types are crossed they exhibit\r\nexactly the same type of heredity as does the black-barred combination in\r\nthe domestic fowl. As shown in figure 41, lacticolor female bred to\r\ngrossulariata male gives grossulariata sons and daughters. These inbred\r\ngive grossulariata males and females and lacticolor females. Reciprocally\r\nlacticolor male by grossulariata female, (fig. 42) gives lacticolor\r\ndaughters and grossulariata sons and these inbred give grossulariata males\r\nand females and lacticolor males and females.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41. Sex-linked inheritance in the wild moth, Abraxas\r\ngrossulariata (darker) and A. lacticolor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42. Reciprocal of Fig. 41.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43. Four wild types of Paratettix in upper line with\r\nthree hybrids below.]\r\n\r\nIt has been found that there may be even more than two factors that show\r\nMendelian segregation when brought together in pairs. For example, in the\r\nsouthern States there are several races of the grouse locust (Paratettix)\r\nthat differ from each other markedly in color patterns (fig. 43). When any\r\ntwo individuals of these races are crossed they give, as Nabours has shown,\r\nin F_2 a Mendelian ratio of 1: 2: 1. It is obvious, therefore, that there\r\nare here at least nine characters, any two of which behave as a Mendelian\r\npair. These races have arisen in nature and differ definitely and\r\nstrikingly from each other, yet any two differ by only one factor\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44. Diagram illustrating four allelomorphs in mice,\r\nviz. gray bellied gray (wild type) (above, to left); white bellied gray\r\n(above, to right); yellow (below, to right); and black (below, to left).]\r\n\r\nSimilar relations have been found in a number of domesticated races. In\r\nmice there is a quadruple system represented by the gray house mouse, the\r\nwhite bellied, the yellow and the black mouse (fig. 44). In rabbits there\r\nis probably a triple system, that includes the albino, the Himalayan, and\r\nthe black races. In the silkworm moth there have been described four types\r\nof larvae, distinguished by different color markings, that form a system of\r\nquadruple allelomorphs. In Drosophila there is a quintuple system of\r\nfactors in the sex chromosome represented by eye colors, a triple system of\r\nbody colors, and a triple system of factors for eye colors in the third\r\nchromosome.\r\n\r\nMUTATION AND EVOLUTION\r\n\r\nWhat bearing has the appearance of these new types of Drosophila on the\r\ntheory of evolution may be asked. The objection has been raised in fact\r\nthat in the breeding work with Drosophila we are dealing with artificial\r\nand unnatural conditions. It has been more than implied that results\r\nobtained from the breeding pen, the seed pan, the flower pot and the milk\r\nbottle do not apply to evolution in the \"open\", nature \"at large\" or to\r\n\"wild\" types. To be consistent, this same objection should be extended to\r\nthe use of the spectroscope in the study of the evolution of the stars, to\r\nthe use of the test tube and the balance by the chemist, of the\r\ngalvanometer by the physicist. All these are unnatural instruments used to\r\ntorture Nature's secrets from her. I venture to think that the real\r\nantithesis is not between unnatural and natural treatment of Nature, but\r\nrather between controlled or verifiable data on the one hand, and\r\nunrestrained generalization on the other.\r\n\r\nIf a systematist were asked whether these new races of Drosophila are\r\ncomparable to wild species, he would not hesitate for a moment. He would\r\ncall them all one species. If he were asked why, he would say, I think,\r\n\"These races differ only in one or two striking points, while in a hundred\r\nother respects they are identical even to the minutest details.\" He would\r\nadd, that as large a group of wild species of flies would show on the whole\r\nthe reverse relations, _viz._, they would differ in nearly every detail and\r\nbe identical in only a few points. In all this I entirely agree with the\r\nsystematist, for I do not think such a group of types differing by one\r\ncharacter each, is comparable to most wild groups of species because the\r\ndifference between wild species is due to a large number of such single\r\ndifferences. The characters that have been accumulated in wild species are\r\nof significance in the maintenance of the species, or at least we are led\r\nto infer that even though the visible character that we attend to may not\r\nitself be important, one at least of the other effects of the factors that\r\nrepresent these characters is significant. It is, of course, hardly to be\r\nexpected that _any_ random change in as complex a mechanism as an insect\r\nwould improve the mechanism, and as a matter of fact it is doubtful whether\r\nany of the mutant types so far discovered are better adapted to those\r\nconditions to which a fly of this structure and habits is already adjusted.\r\nBut this is beside the mark, for modern genetics shows very positively that\r\nadaptive characters are inherited in exactly the same way as are those that\r\nare not adaptive; and I have already pointed out that we cannot study a\r\nsingle mutant factor without at the same time studying one of the factors\r\nresponsible for normal characters, for the two together constitute the\r\nMendelian pair.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, I want to urge on your attention a question that we are to\r\nconsider in more detail in the last lecture. Evolution of wild species\r\nappears to have taken place by modifying and improving bit by bit the\r\nstructures and habits that the animal or plant already possessed. We have\r\nseen that there are thirty mutant factors at least that have an influence\r\non eye color, and it is probable that there are at least as many normal\r\nfactors that are involved in the production of the red eye of the wild fly.\r\n\r\nEvolution from this point of view has consisted largely in introducing new\r\nfactors that influence characters already present in the animal or plant.\r\n\r\nSuch a view gives us a somewhat different picture of the process of\r\nevolution from the old idea of a ferocious struggle between the individuals\r\nof a species with the survival of the fittest and the annihilation of the\r\nless fit. Evolution assumes a more peaceful aspect. New and advantageous\r\ncharacters survive by incorporating themselves into the race, improving it\r\nand opening to it new opportunities. In other words, the emphasis may be\r\nplaced less on the competition between the individuals of a species\r\n(because the destruction of the less fit does not _in itself_ lead to\r\nanything that is new) than on the appearance of new characters and\r\nmodifications of old characters that become incorporated in the species,\r\nfor on these depends the evolution of the race.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FACTORIAL THEORY OF HEREDITY AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE GERM PLASM\r\n\r\nThe discovery that Mendel made with edible peas concerning heredity has\r\nbeen found to apply everywhere throughout the plant and animal kingdoms--to\r\nflowering plants, to insects, snails, crustacea, fishes, amphibians, birds,\r\nand mammals (including man).\r\n\r\nThere must be something that these widely separated groups of plants and\r\nanimals have in common--some simple mechanism perhaps--to give such\r\ndefinite and orderly series of results. There is, in fact, a mechanism,\r\npossessed alike by animals and plants, that fulfills every requirement of\r\nMendel's principles.\r\n\r\nTHE CELLULAR BASIS OF ORGANIC EVOLUTION AND HEREDITY\r\n\r\nIn order to appreciate the full force of the evidence, let me first pass\r\nrapidly in review a few familiar, historical facts, that preceded the\r\ndiscovery of the mechanism in question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45. Typical cell showing the cell wall, the protoplasm\r\n(with its contained materials); the nucleus with its contained chromatin\r\nand nuclear sap. (After Dahlgren.)]\r\n\r\nThroughout the greater part of the last century, while students of\r\nevolution and of heredity were engaged in what I may call the more general,\r\nor, shall I say, the _grosser_ aspects of the subject, there existed\r\nanother group of students who were engaged in working out the minute\r\nstructure of the material basis of the living organism. They found that\r\norgans such as the brain, the heart, the liver, the lungs, the kidneys,\r\netc., are not themselves the units of structure, but that all these organs\r\ncan be reduced to a simpler unit that repeats itself a thousand-fold in\r\nevery organ. We call this unit a cell (fig. 45).\r\n\r\nThe egg is a cell, and the spermatozoon is a cell. The act of fertilization\r\nis the union of two cells (fig. 47, upper figure). Simple as the process of\r\nfertilization appears to us today, its discovery swept aside a vast amount\r\nof mystical speculation concerning the rôle of the male and of the female\r\nin the act of procreation.\r\n\r\nWithin the cell a new microcosm was revealed. Every cell was found to\r\ncontain a spherical body called the nucleus (fig. 46a). Within the nucleus\r\nis a network of fibres, a sap fills the interstices of the network. The\r\nnetwork resolves itself into a definite number of threads at each division\r\nof the cell (fig. 46 b-e). These threads we call chromosomes. Each species\r\nof animals and plants possesses a characteristic number of these threads\r\nwhich have a definite size and sometimes a specific shape and even\r\ncharacteristic granules at different levels. Beyond this point our\r\nstrongest microscopes fail to penetrate. Observation has reached, for the\r\ntime being, its limit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46. A series of cells in process of cell division. The\r\nchromosomes are the black threads and rods. (After Dahlgren.)]\r\n\r\nThe story is taken up at this point by a new set of students who have\r\nworked in an entirely different field. Certain observations and experiments\r\nthat we have not time to consider now, led a number of biologists to\r\nconclude that the chromosomes are the bearers of the hereditary units. If\r\nso, there should be many such units carried by _each_ chromosome, for the\r\nnumber of chromosomes is limited while the number of independently\r\ninherited characters is large. In Drosophila it has been demonstrated not\r\nonly that there are exactly as many groups of characters that are inherited\r\ntogether as there are pairs of chromosomes, but even that it is possible to\r\nlocate one of these groups in a particular chromosome and to state the\r\n_relative position_ there of the factors for the characters. If the\r\nvalidity of this evidence is accepted, the study of the cell leads us\r\nfinally in a mechanical, but not in a chemical sense, to the ultimate units\r\nabout which the whole process of the transmission of the hereditary factors\r\ncenters.\r\n\r\nBut before plunging into this somewhat technical matter (that is difficult\r\nonly because it is unfamiliar), certain facts which are familiar for the\r\nmost part should be recalled, because on these turns the whole of the\r\nsubsequent story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47. An egg, and the division of the egg--the so-called\r\nprocess of cleavage. (After Selenka.)]\r\n\r\nThe thousands of cells that make up the cell-state that we call an animal\r\nor plant come from the fertilized egg. An hour or two after fertilization\r\nthe egg divides into two cells (fig. 47). Then each half divides again.\r\nEach quarter next divides. The process continues until a large number of\r\ncells is formed and out of these organs mould themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48. Section of the egg of the beetle, Calligrapha,\r\nshowing the pigment at one end where the germ cells will later develop as\r\nshown in the other two figures. (After Hegner.)]\r\n\r\nAt every division of the cell the chromosomes also divide. Half of these\r\nhave come from the mother, half from the father. Every cell contains,\r\ntherefore, the sum total of all the chromosomes, and if these are the\r\nbearers of the hereditary qualities, every cell in the body, whatever its\r\nfunction, has a common inheritance.\r\n\r\nAt an early stage in the development of the animal certain cells are set\r\napart to form the organs of reproduction. In some animals these cells can\r\nbe identified early in the cleavage (fig. 48).\r\n\r\nThe reproductive cells are at first like all the other cells in the body in\r\nthat they contain a full complement of chromosomes, half paternal and half\r\nmaternal in origin (fig. 49). They divide as do the other cells of the body\r\nfor a long time (fig. 49, upper row). At each division each chromosome\r\nsplits lengthwise and its halves migrate to opposite poles of the spindle\r\n(fig. 49 c).\r\n\r\nBut there comes a time when a new process appears in the germ cells (fig 49\r\ne-h). It is essentially the same in the egg and in the sperm cells. The\r\ndiscovery of this process we owe to the laborious researches of many\r\nworkers in many countries. The list of their names is long, and I shall not\r\neven attempt to repeat it. The chromosomes come together in pairs (fig. 49\r\na). Each maternal chromosome mates with a paternal chromosome of the same\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49. In the upper row of the diagram a typical process\r\nof nuclear division, such as takes place in the early germ cells or in the\r\nbody cells. In the lower row the separation of the chromosomes that have\r\npaired. This sort of separation takes place at one of the two reduction\r\ndivisions.]\r\n\r\nThen follow two rapid divisions (fig. 49 f, g and 50 and 51). At one of the\r\ndivisions the double chromosomes separate so that each resulting cell comes\r\nto contain some maternal and some paternal chromosomes, i.e. one or the\r\nother member of each pair. At the other division each chromosome simply\r\nsplits as in ordinary cell division.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50. The two maturation divisions of the sperm cell.\r\nFour sperms result, each with half (haploid) the full number (diploid) of\r\nchromosomes.]\r\n\r\nThe upshot of the process is that the ripe eggs (fig. 51) and the ripe\r\nspermatozoa (fig. 50) come to contain only half the total number of\r\nchromosomes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51. The two maturation divisions of the egg. The\r\ndivisions are unequal, so that two small polar bodies are formed one of\r\nthese subsequently divides. The three polar bodies and the egg are\r\ncomparable to the four sperms.]\r\n\r\nWhen the eggs are fertilized the whole number of chromosomes is restored\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTHE MECHANISM OF MENDELIAN HEREDITY DISCOVERED IN THE BEHAVIOR OF THE\r\nCHROMOSOMES\r\n\r\nIf the factors in heredity are carried in the chromosomes and if the\r\nchromosomes are definite structures, we should anticipate that there should\r\nbe as many _groups_ of characters as there are kinds of chromosomes. In\r\nonly one case has a sufficient number of characters been studied to show\r\nwhether there is any correspondence between the number of hereditary groups\r\nof characters and the number of chromosomes. In the fruit fly, Drosophila\r\nampelophila, we have found about 125 characters that are inherited in a\r\nperfectly definite way. On the opposite page is a list of some of them.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed in this list that the characters are arranged in four\r\ngroups, Groups I, II, III and IV. Three of these groups are equally large\r\nor nearly so; Group IV contains only two characters. The characters are put\r\ninto these groups because in heredity the members of each group tend to be\r\ninherited together, i.e., if two or more enter the cross together they tend\r\nto remain together through subsequent generations. On the other hand, any\r\nmember of one group is inherited entirely independently of any member of\r\nthe other groups; in the same way as Mendel's yellow-green pair of\r\ncharacters is inherited independently of the round-wrinkled pair.\r\n\r\n  _Group I_       _Group II_        _Group III_        _Group IV_\r\n   Abnormal        Antlered          Band               Bent\r\n   Bar             Apterous          Beaded             Eyeless\r\n   Bifid           Arc               Cream III\r\n   Bow             Balloon           Deformed\r\n   Cherry          Black             Dwarf\r\n   Chrome          Blistered         Ebony\r\n   Cleft           Comma             Giant\r\n   Club            Confluent         Kidney\r\n   Depressed       Cream II          Low crossing over\r\n   Dot             Curved            Maroon\r\n   Eosin           Dachs             Peach\r\n   Facet           Extra vein        Pink\r\n   Forked          Fringed           Rough\r\n   Furrowed        Jaunty            Safranin\r\n   Fused           Limited           Sepia\r\n   Green           Little crossover  Sooty\r\n   Jaunty          Morula            Spineless\r\n   Lemon           Olive             Spread\r\n   Lethals, 13     Plexus            Trident\r\n   Miniature       Purple            Truncate intensifier\r\n   Notch           Speck             Whitehead\r\n   Reduplicated    Strap             White ocelli\r\n   Ruby            Streak\r\n   Rudimentary     Trefoil\r\n   Sable           Truncate\r\n   Shifted         Vestigial\r\n   Short\r\n   Skee\r\n   Spoon\r\n   Spot\r\n   Tan\r\n   Truncate intensifier\r\n   Vermilion\r\n   White\r\n   Yellow\r\n\r\nIf the factors for these characters are carried by the chromosomes, then we\r\nshould expect that those factors that are carried by the same chromosome\r\nwould be inherited together, provided the chromosomes are definite\r\nstructures in the cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52. Chromosomes (diploid) of D. ampelophila. The sex\r\nchromosomes are XX in the female and XY in the male. There are three other\r\npairs of chromosomes.]\r\n\r\nIn the chromosome group of Drosophila, (fig. 52) there are _four_ pairs of\r\nchromosomes, three of nearly the same size and one much smaller. Not only\r\nis there agreement between the number of hereditary groups and the number\r\nof the chromosomes, but even the size relations are the same, for there are\r\nthree great groups of characters and three pairs of large chromosomes, and\r\none small group of characters and one pair of small chromosomes.\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR GREAT LINKAGE GROUPS OF DROSOPHILA AMPELOPHILA\r\n\r\nThe following description of the characters of the wild fly may be useful\r\nin connection with the account of the modifications of these characters\r\nthat appear in the mutants.\r\n\r\nThe head and thorax of the wild fly are grayish-yellow, the abdomen is\r\nbanded with alternate stripes of yellow and black. In the male, (fig. 4 to\r\nright), there are three narrow bands and a black tip. In the female there\r\nare five black bands (fig. 4 to left). The wings are gray with a surface\r\ntexture of such a kind that at certain angles they are iridescent. The eyes\r\nare a deep, solid, brick-red. The minute hairs that cover the body have a\r\nvery definite arrangement that is most obvious on the head and thorax.\r\nThere is a definite number of larger hairs called bristles or chaetae which\r\nhave a characteristic position and are used for diagnostic purposes in\r\nclassifying the species. On the foreleg of the male there is a comb-like\r\norgan formed by a row of bristles; it is absent in the female. The comb is\r\na secondary sexual character, and it is, so far as known, functionless.\r\n\r\nSome of the characters of the mutant types are shown in figures 53, 54, 55,\r\n56. The drawing of a single fly is often used here to illustrate more than\r\none character. This is done to economize space, but of course there would\r\nbe no difficulty in actually bringing together in the same individual any\r\ntwo or more characters belonging to the same group (or to different\r\ngroups). Without colored figures it is not possible to show many of the\r\nmost striking differences of these mutant races; at most dark and light\r\ncoloring can be indicated by the shading of the body, wings, or eyes.\r\n\r\n_Group I_\r\n\r\nIn the six flies drawn in figure 53 there are shown five different wing\r\ncharacters. The first of these types (a) is called cut, because the ends of\r\nthe wings look as though they had been cut to a point. The antennae are\r\ndisplaced downward and appressed and their bristle-like aristae are\r\ncrumpled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53. Group I. (See text)]\r\n\r\nThe second figure (b) represents a fly with a notch in the ends of the\r\nwings. This character is dominant, but the same factor that produces the\r\nnotch in the wings is also a recessive lethal factor; because of this\r\nlatter effect of the character no males of this race exist, and the females\r\nof the race are never pure but hybrid. Every female with notch wings bred\r\nto a wild male, will produce in equal numbers notch winged daughters and\r\ndaughters with normal wings. There will be half as many sons as daughters.\r\nThe explanation of this peculiar result is quite simple. Every notch winged\r\nfemale has one X chromosome that carries the factor for notch and one X\r\nchromosome that is \"normal\". Daughters receiving the former chromosomes are\r\nnotched because the factor for notch is dominant, but they are not killed\r\nsince the lethal effect of the notch factor is recessive to the normal\r\nallelomorph carried by the other chromosome that the daughters get from\r\ntheir father. This normal factor is recessive for notch but dominant for\r\nlife. This same figure (b) is used here to show three other sex linked\r\ncharacters. The spines on the thorax are twisted or kinky, which is due to\r\na factor called \"forked\". The effect is best seen on the thorax, but all\r\nspines on the body are similarly modified; even the minute hairs are also\r\naffected. Ruby eye color might be here represented--if the eyes in the\r\nfigure were colored. The lighter color of the body and antennae is intended\r\nto indicate that the character tan is also present. The light color of the\r\nantennae is the most certain way of identifying tan. The tan flies are\r\ninteresting because they have lost the positive heliotropism that is so\r\nmarked a feature in the behavior of D. ampelophila. As this peculiarity of\r\nthe tan flies is inherited like all the other sex linked characters, it\r\nfollows that when a tan female is bred to a wild male all the sons inherit\r\nthe recessive tan color and indifference to light, while the daughters show\r\nthe dominant sex linked character of their father, i.e., they are \"gray\",\r\nand go to the light. Hence when such a brood is disturbed the females fly\r\nto the light, but the males remain behind.\r\n\r\nOne of the first mutants that appeared in D. ampelophila was called\r\nrudimentary on account of the condition of the wings (c). The same mutation\r\nhas appeared independently several times. In the drawing (c) the dark body\r\ncolor is intended to indicate \"sable\" and the lighter color of the eyes is\r\nintended to indicate eosin. This eye color, which is an allelomorph of\r\nwhite, is also interesting because in the female the color is deeper than\r\nin the male. In other cases of sex linked factors the character is the same\r\nin the two sexes.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth figure (d) the third and fourth longitudinal veins of the\r\nwing are _fused_ into one vein from the base of the wing to the level of\r\nthe first cross-vein and in addition converge and meet near their outer\r\nends. The shape of the eye is represented in the figure as different from\r\nthe normal, due to another factor called \"bar\". This is a dominant\r\ncharacter, the hybrid condition being also narrow, but not so narrow as the\r\npure type. Vermilion eye color might also be here represented--due to a\r\nfactor that has appeared independently on several occasions.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth figure (e) the wings are shorter and more pointed than in the\r\nwild fly. This character is called miniature. The light color of the\r\ndrawing may be taken to represent yellow body color, and the light color of\r\nthe eye white eye color.\r\n\r\nIn the last figure (f) the wings are represented as pads, essentially in\r\nthe same condition that they are in when the fly emerges from the pupa\r\ncase. Not all the flies of this stock have the wings in this condition;\r\nsome have fully expanded wings that appear normal in all respects.\r\nNevertheless, about the same percentage of offspring show the pads\r\nirrespective of whether the parents had pads or expanded wings.\r\n\r\nThe flies of this stock show, however, another character, which is a\r\nproduct of the same factor, and which is constant, i.e., repeated in all\r\nindividuals. The two bristles on the sides of the thorax are constantly\r\nabsent in this race. The lighter color of the eye in the figure may be\r\ntaken to indicate buff--a faint yellowish color. The factor for this eye\r\ncolor is another allelomorph of white.\r\n\r\nThere are many other interesting characters that belong to the first group,\r\nsuch as abnormal abdomen, short legs, duplication of the legs, etc. In\r\nfact, any part of the body may be affected by a sex-linked factor.\r\n\r\n_Group II_\r\n\r\nIn the first figure (a) of figure 54 that contains members of Group II the\r\nwings are almost entirely absent or \"vestigial\". This condition arose at a\r\nsingle step and breeds true, although it appears to be influenced to some\r\nextent by temperature, also by modifiers that sometimes appear in the\r\nstock. Purple eye color belongs in Group II; it resembles the color of the\r\neye of the wild fly but is darker and more translucent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54. Group II. (See text.)]\r\n\r\nIn the second figure (b) the wing is again long and narrow and sometimes\r\nbent back on itself, as shown here. In several respects the wing resembles\r\nstrap (d) but seems to be due to another factor, called antler,\r\ninsufficiently studied as yet.\r\n\r\nIn the third figure (c) the wings turn up at the end. This is brought about\r\nby the presence of the factor called jaunty.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth figure the wings are long and narrow and several of the veins\r\nare unrepresented. This character, \"strap\", is very variable and has not\r\nyet been thoroughly studied. On the thorax there is a deep black mark\r\ncalled trefoil. Even in the wild fly there is a three pronged mark on the\r\nthorax present in many individuals. Trefoil is a further development and\r\nmodification of this mark and is due to a special factor.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth figure (e) the wings are arched. The factor is called arc. The\r\ndark color of the body, and especially of the wings, indicates the factor\r\nfor black.\r\n\r\nThe sixth figure (f) shows the wings \"curved\" downwards. In addition there\r\nis present a minute black speck at the base of each wing, due to another\r\nfactor called speck.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh figure (g) the wing is truncate. Its end is obliquely\r\nsquared instead of rounded; it may be longer than the body, or shorter when\r\nother modifying factors are present. The mutation that produces this type\r\nof wing is of not infrequent occurrence. It has been shown by Muller and\r\nAltenburg that there are at least two factors that modify this\r\ncharacter--the chief factor is present in the second chromosome; alone it\r\nproduces the truncate wing in only a certain percentage of cases, but when\r\nthe modifiers are also present about ninety percent of the individuals may\r\nshow the truncate condition of the wing. But the presence of these factors\r\nmakes the stock very infertile, so that it is difficult to maintain.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth figure (h) the legs are shortened owing to the absence of a\r\nsegment of the tarsus. The stock is called dachs--a nickname given to it\r\nbecause the short legs suggested the dachshund.\r\n\r\n_Group III_\r\n\r\nIn figure 55, (a), a mutant type called bithorax is shown. The old\r\nmetathorax is replaced by another mesothorax thrust in between the normal\r\nmesothorax and the abdomen. It carries a pair of wings that do not\r\ncompletely unfold. On this new mesothorax the characteristic arrangement of\r\nthe bristles is shown. Thus at a single step a typical region of the body\r\nhas doubled. The character is recessive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55. Group III. (See text.)]\r\n\r\nThe size of the adult fly of D. ampelophila varies greatly according to the\r\namount of nourishment obtained by the larva. After the fly emerges its size\r\nremains nearly constant, as in many insects. Two races have, however, been\r\nseparated by Bridges that are different in size as a result of a genetic\r\nfactor. The first of these, called dwarf, is represented by figure 55, (b).\r\n\r\nThe race is minute, although of course its size is variable, depending on\r\nfood and other conditions. The same figure shows the presence of another\r\nfactor, \"sooty\", that makes the fly very dark. Maroon eye color might be\r\nhere represented, due to still another factor.\r\n\r\nIn the third figure (c) the other mutation in size is shown. It is called\r\n\"giant\". The flies are twice the size of wild flies. An eye color, called\r\npeach, might here be represented. It is an allelomorph of pink.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth figure (d) the mutant called dichaete is shown. It is\r\ncharacterized by the absence of two of the bristles on the thorax. Other\r\nbristles may also be absent, but not so constantly as the two just\r\nmentioned. Another effect of the same factor is the spread-out condition of\r\nthe wings. The very dark eye color in this figure may be taken to indicate\r\nthe presence of another factor, \"sepia\", which causes the eyes to assume a\r\nbrown color that becomes black with age. Most of the other mutations in eye\r\ncolor that have occurred tend to give a lighter color: this one, which is\r\nalso recessive, makes the eye darker.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth figure (e) the color of the darkest fly is due to a factor\r\ncalled ebony, which is an allelomorph of sooty.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth figure (f) the wings are beaded, i.e., the margin is defective\r\nat intervals, giving a beaded-like outline to the wings. This condition is\r\nvery variable and much affected by other factors that influence the shape\r\nof the wings. The lighter eye color of the drawing may be taken to\r\nrepresent pink.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh figure (g) the wings are curled up over the back. This is a\r\nrecessive character.\r\n\r\n_Group IV_\r\n\r\nOnly two mutants have been obtained that do not belong to any of the\r\npreceding groups; these are put together in Group IV. It has been shown\r\nthat they are linked to each other and the linkage is so close that it has\r\nthus far been impossible to obtain the dominant recessive. One of these\r\nmutants, called \"eyeless\" (fig. 56, a, a^1), is variable--the eyes are\r\noften entirely absent or represented by one or more groups of ommatidia.\r\nThe outline of the original eye, so to speak, is strongly marked out and\r\nits area might be called a rudimentary organ, if such a statement has any\r\nmeaning here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56. Group IV. (See text.)]\r\n\r\nThe other figure (b) represents \"bent\", so called from the shape of the\r\nwings. This mutant is likewise very variable, often indistinguishable from\r\nthe wild type, yet when well developed strikingly different from any other\r\nmutant.\r\n\r\nThis brief account of a few of the mutant races that can be most easily\r\nrepresented by uncolored figures will serve to show how all parts of the\r\nbody may change, some of the changes being so slight that they would be\r\noverlooked except by an expert, others so great that in the character\r\naffected the flies depart far from the original species.\r\n\r\n_It is important to note that mutations in the first chromosome are not\r\nlimited to any part of the body nor do they affect more frequently a\r\nparticular part. The same statement holds equally for all of the other\r\nchromosomes. In fact, since each factor may affect visibly several parts of\r\nthe body at the same time there are no grounds for expecting any special\r\nrelation between a given chromosome and special regions of the body. It can\r\nnot too insistently be urged that when we say a character is the product of\r\na particular factor we mean no more than that it is the most conspicuous\r\neffect of the factor._\r\n\r\nIf, then, as these and other results to be described point to the\r\nchromosomes as the bearers of the Mendelian factors, and if, as will be\r\nshown presently, these factors have a definite location in the chromosomes\r\nit is clear that the location of the factors in the chromosomes bears no\r\nspatial relation to the location of the parts of the body to each other.\r\n\r\nLOCALIZATION OF FACTORS IN THE CHROMOSOMES\r\n\r\n_The Evidence from Sex Linked Inheritance_\r\n\r\nWhen we follow the history of pairs of chromosomes we find that their\r\ndistribution in successive generations is paralleled by the inheritance of\r\nMendelian characters. This is best shown in the sex chromosomes (fig. 57).\r\nIn the female there are two of these chromosomes that we call the X\r\nchromosomes; in the male there are also two but one differs from those of\r\nthe female in its shape, and in the fact that it carries none of the normal\r\nallelomorphs of the mutant factors. It is called the Y chromosome.\r\n\r\nThe course followed by the sex chromosomes and that by the characters in\r\nthe case of sex linked inheritance are shown in the next diagram of\r\nDrosophila illustrating a cross between a white eyed male and a red eyed\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57. Scheme of sex determination in Drosophila type.\r\nEach _mature_ egg contains one X, each mature sperm contains one X, or a Y\r\nchromosome. Chance union of any egg with any sperm will give either XX\r\n(female) or XY (male).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58. Cross between white eyed male of D. ampelophila and\r\nred eyed female. The sex chromosomes are indicated by the rods. A black rod\r\nindicates that the chromosome carries the factor for red; the open\r\nchromosome the factor for white eye color.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these represents a cross between a white eyed male and a red\r\neyed female (fig. 58, top row). The X chromosome in the male is represented\r\nby an open bar, the Y chromosome is bent. In the female the two X\r\nchromosomes are black. Each egg of such a female will contain one \"black\" X\r\nafter the polar bodies have been thrown off. In the male there will be two\r\nclasses of sperm--the female-producing, carrying the (open) X, and the\r\nmale-producing, carrying the Y chromosome. Any egg fertilized by an X\r\nbearing sperm will produce a female that will have red eyes because the X\r\n(black) chromosome it gets from the mother carries the dominant factor for\r\nred. Any egg fertilized by a Y-bearing sperm will produce a male that will\r\nalso have red eyes because he gets his (black) X chromosome from his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, these two F_1 flies (second row) are inbred the following\r\ncombinations are expected. Each egg will contain a black X (red eye\r\nproducing) or a white X (white eye producing) after the polar bodies have\r\nbeen extruded. The male will produce two kinds of sperms, of which the\r\nfemale producing will contain a black X (red eye producing). Since any egg\r\nmay by chance be fertilized by any sperm there will result the four classes\r\nof individuals shown on the bottom row of the diagram. All the females will\r\nhave red eyes, because irrespective of the two kinds of eggs involved all\r\nthe female-producing sperm carry a black X. Half of the males have red eyes\r\nbecause half of the eggs have had each a red-producing X chromosome. The\r\nother half of the males have white eyes, because the other half of the eggs\r\nhad each a white-producing X chromosome. Other evidence has shown that the\r\nY chromosome of the male is indifferent, so far as these Mendelian factors\r\nare concerned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59. Cross between red eyed male and white eyed female;\r\nreciprocal cross of Fig. 58.]\r\n\r\nThe reciprocal experiment is illustrated in figure 59. A white eyed female\r\nis mated to a red eyed male (top row). All the mature eggs of such a female\r\ncontain one white-producing X chromosome represented by the open bar in the\r\ndiagram. The red eyed male contains female-producing X-bearing sperm that\r\ncarry the factor for red eye color, and male-producing Y chromosomes. Any\r\negg fertilized by an X-bearing sperm will become a red eyed female because\r\nthe X chromosome that comes from the father carries the dominant factor for\r\nred eye color. Any egg fertilized by a Y-bearing sperm will become a male\r\nwith white eyes because the only X chromosome that the male contains comes\r\nfrom his mother and is white producing.\r\n\r\nWhen these two F_1 flies are inbred (middle row) the following combinations\r\nare expected. Half the eggs will contain each a white producing X\r\nchromosome and half red producing. The female-producing sperms will each\r\ncontain a white X and the male-producing sperms will each contain an\r\nindifferent Y chromosome. Chance meetings of egg and sperm will give the\r\nfour F_2 classes (bottom row). These consist of white eyed and red eyed\r\nfemales and white eyed and red eyed males. The ratio here is 1:1 and not\r\nthree to one (3:1) as in other Mendelian cases. But Mendel's law of\r\nsegregation is not transgressed, as the preceding analysis has shown; for,\r\nthe chromosomes have followed strictly the course laid down on Mendel's\r\nprinciple for the distribution of factors. The peculiar result in this case\r\nis due to the fact that the F_1 male gets his single factor for eye color\r\nfrom his mother only and it is linked to or contained in a body (the X\r\nchromosome) that is involved in producing the females, while the mate of\r\nthis body--the Y chromosome--is indifferent with regard to these factors,\r\nyet active as a mate to X in synapsis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60. Diagram of sex determination in type with XX female\r\nand XO male (after Wilson).]\r\n\r\nIn man there are several characters that show exactly this same kind of\r\ninheritance. Color blindness, or at least certain kinds of color blindness,\r\nappear to follow the same scheme. A color blind father transmits through\r\nhis daughters his peculiarity to half of his grandsons, but to none of his\r\ngrand-daughters (fig. 38A). The result is the same as in the case of the\r\nwhite eyed male of Drosophila. Color blind women are rather unusual, which\r\nis expected from the method of inheritance of this character, but in the\r\nfew known cases where such color blind women have married normal husbands\r\nthe sons have inherited the peculiarity from the mother (fig. 38B). Here\r\nagain the result is the same as for the similar combination in Drosophila.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61. Spermatogenesis in man. There are 47 chromosomes\r\n(diploid) in the male. After reduction half of the sperm carry 24\r\nchromosomes (one of which is X) and half carry 23 chromosomes (no X).]\r\n\r\nIn man the sex formula appears to be XX for the female and XO for the male\r\n(fig. 60), and since the relation is essentially the same as that in\r\nDrosophila the chromosome explanation is the same. According to von\r\nWiniwarter there are 48 chromosomes in the female and 47 in the male (fig.\r\n61). After the extrusion of the polar bodies there are 24 chromosomes in\r\nthe egg. In the male at one of the two maturation divisions the X\r\nchromosome passes to one pole undivided (fig. 61, C). In consequence there\r\nare two classes of sperms in man; female producing containing 24\r\nchromosomes, and male producing containing 23 chromosomes. If the factor\r\nfor color blindness is carried by the X chromosome its inheritance in man\r\nworks out on the same chromosome scheme and in the same way as does white\r\neye color (or any other sex linked character) in the fly, for the O sperm\r\nin man is equivalent to the Y sperm in the fly.\r\n\r\nIn these cases we have been dealing with a single pair of characters. Let\r\nus now take a case where two pairs of sex linked characters enter the cross\r\nat the same time, and preferably a case where the two recessives enter the\r\ncross from the same parent.\r\n\r\nIf a female with white eyes and yellow wings is crossed to a wild male with\r\nred eyes and gray wings (fig. 62), the sons are yellow and have white eyes\r\nand the daughters are gray and have red eyes. If two F_1 flies are mated\r\nthey will produce the following classes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62. Cross between a white eyed, yellow winged female of\r\nD. ampelophila and a red eyed, gray winged male. Two pairs of sex linked\r\ncharacters, viz., white-red and yellow-gray are involved. (See text.)]\r\n\r\n  Yellow  Gray  Yellow  Gray\r\n  White   Red   Red     White\r\n  ------------  -------------\r\n        |             |\r\n       99.%          1.%\r\n\r\nNot only have the two grandparental combinations reappeared, but in\r\naddition two new combinations, viz., grey white and yellow red. The two\r\noriginal combinations far exceed in numbers the new or exchange\r\ncombinations. If we follow the history of the X chromosomes we discover\r\nthat the _larger classes_ of grandchildren appear in accord with the way in\r\nwhich the X chromosomes are transmitted from one generation to the next.\r\n\r\nThe _smaller classes_ of grandchildren, the exchange combinations or\r\ncross-overs, as we call them, can be explained by the assumption that at\r\nsome stage in their history an interchange of parts has taken place between\r\nthe chromosomes. This is indicated in the diagrams.\r\n\r\nThe most important fact brought out by the experiment is that the factors\r\nthat went in together tend to stick together. It makes no difference in\r\nwhat combination the members of the two pairs of characters enter, they\r\ntend to remain in that combination.\r\n\r\nIf one admits that the sex chromosomes carry these factors for the\r\nsex-linked characters--and the evidence is certainly very strong in favor\r\nof this view--it follows necessarily from these facts that at some time in\r\ntheir history there has been an interchange between the two sex chromosomes\r\nin the female.\r\n\r\nThere are several stages in the conjugation of the chromosomes at which\r\nsuch an interchange between the members of a pair might occur. There is\r\nfurther a small amount of direct evidence, unfortunately very meagre at\r\npresent, showing that an interchange does actually occur.\r\n\r\nAt the ripening period of the germ cell the members of each pair of\r\nchromosomes come together (fig. 49, e). In several forms they have been\r\ndescribed as meeting at one end and then progressively coming to lie side\r\nby side as shown in fig. 63, e, f, g, h, i. At the end of the process they\r\nappear to have completely united along their length (fig. 63, j, k, l). It\r\nis always a maternal and a paternal chromosome that meet in this way and\r\nalways two of the same kind. It has been observed that as the members of a\r\npair come together they occasionally twist around each other (fig. 63, g,\r\nl, and 64, and 65). In consequence a part of one chromosome comes to be now\r\non one side and now on the other side of its mate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63. Conjugation of chromosomes (side to side union) in\r\nthe spermatogenesis of Batracoseps. (After Janssens.)]\r\n\r\nWhen the chromosomes separate at the next division of the germ cell the\r\npart on one side passes to one pole, the part on the other to the opposite\r\npole, (figs. 64 and 65). Whenever the chromosomes do not untwist at this\r\ntime there must result an interchange of pieces where they were crossed\r\nover each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64. Scheme to illustrate a method of crossing over of\r\nthe chromosomes.]\r\n\r\nJanssens has found at the time of separation evidence in favor of the view\r\nthat some such interchange probably takes place.\r\n\r\nWe find this same process of interchange of characters taking place in each\r\nof the other three groups of Drosophila. An example will show this for the\r\nGroup II.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65. Scheme to illustrate double crossing over.]\r\n\r\nIf a black vestigial male is crossed to a gray long-winged female (fig. 66)\r\nthe offspring are gray long. If an F_1 female is back-crossed to a black\r\nvestigial male the following kinds of flies are produced:\r\n\r\n  Black        Gray       Black   Gray\r\n  vestigial    long       long    vestigial\r\n  -----------------       -----------------\r\n          |                      |\r\n         83%                    17%\r\n\r\nThe combinations that entered are more common in the F_2 generations than\r\nthe cross-over classes, showing that there is linkage of the factors that\r\nentered together.\r\n\r\nAnother curious fact is brought out if instead of back-crossing the F_1\r\nfemale we back-cross the F_1 male to a black vestigial female. Their\r\noffspring are now of only two kinds, black vestigial and gray long. This\r\nmeans that in the male there is no crossing-over or interchange of pieces.\r\nThis relation holds not only for the Group II but for all the other groups\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nWhy interchange takes place in the female of Drosophila and not in the male\r\nwe do not know at present. We might surmise that when in the male the\r\nmembers of a pair come together they do not twist around each other, hence\r\nno crossing-over results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66. Cross between black vestigial and gray long flies.\r\nTwo pairs of factors involved in the second group. The F_1 female is back\r\ncrossed (to right) to black vestigial male; and the F_1 male is back\r\ncrossed to black vestigial female (to left). Crossing over takes place in\r\nthe F_1 female but not in the F_1 male.]\r\n\r\nCrossing-over took place between white and yellow only once in a hundred\r\ntimes. Other characters show different values, but the same value under the\r\nsame conditions is obtained from the same pair of characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67. Map of four chromosomes of D. ampelophila locating\r\nthose factors in each group that have been most fully studied.]\r\n\r\nIf we assume that the nearer together the factors lie in the chromosome the\r\nless likely is a twist to occur between them, and conversely the farther\r\napart they lie the more likely is a twist to occur between them, we can\r\nunderstand how the linkage is different for different pairs of factors.\r\n\r\nOn this basis we have made out chromosomal maps for each chromosome (fig.\r\n67). The diagram indicates those loci that have been most accurately\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\n_The Evidence from Interference_\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable body of information that we have obtained that\r\ncorroborates the location of the factors in the chromosome. This evidence\r\nis too technical to take up in any detail, but there is one result that is\r\nso important that I must attempt to explain it. If, as I assume, crossing\r\nover is brought about by twisting of the chromosomes, and if owing to the\r\nmaterial of the chromosomes there is a most frequent distance of internode,\r\nthen, when crossing over between nodes takes place at same level at a-b in\r\nfigure 68, the region on each side of that point, a to A and b to B, should\r\nbe protected, so to speak, from further crossing over. This in fact we have\r\nfound to be the case. No other explanation so far proposed will account for\r\nthis extraordinary relation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68. Scheme to indicate that when the members of a pair\r\nof chromosomes cross (at a-b) the region on each side is protected\r\ninversely to the distance from a-b.]\r\n\r\nWhat advantage, may be asked, is there in obtaining numerical data of this\r\nkind? It is this:--whenever a new character appears we need only determine\r\nin which of the four groups it lies and its distance from two members\r\nwithin that group. With this information we can predict with a high degree\r\nof probability what results it will give with any other member of any\r\ngroup. Thus we can do on paper what would require many months of labor by\r\nmaking the actual experiment. In a word we can predict what will happen in\r\na situation where prediction is impossible without this numerical\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n_The Evidence from Non-Disjunction_\r\n\r\nIn the course of the work on Drosophila exceptions appeared in one strain\r\nwhere certain individuals did not conform to the scheme of sex linked\r\ninheritance. For a moment the hypothesis seemed to fail, but a careful\r\nexamination led to the suspicion that in this strain something had happened\r\nto the sex chromosomes. It was seen that if in some way the X chromosomes\r\nfailed to disjoin in certain eggs, the exceptions could be explained. The\r\nanalysis led to the suggestion that if the Y chromosome had got into the\r\nfemale line the results would be accounted for, since its presence there\r\nwould be expected to cause this peculiar non-disjunction of the X\r\nchromosomes.\r\n\r\nThat this was the explanation was shown when the material was examined. The\r\nfemales that gave these results were found by Bridges to have two X's and a\r\nY chromosome.\r\n\r\nThe normal chromosome group of the female is shown in figure 52 and the\r\nchromosome group of one of the exceptional females is shown in figure 69.\r\nIn a female of this kind there are three sex chromosomes X X Y which are\r\nhomologous in the sense that in normal individuals the two present are\r\nmates and separate at the reduction division. If in the X X Y individual X\r\nand X conjugate and separate at reduction and the unmated Y is free to move\r\nto either pole of the spindle, two kinds of mature eggs will result, viz.,\r\nX and XY. If, on the other hand, X and Y conjugate and separate at\r\nreduction and the remaining X is free to go to either pole, four kinds of\r\neggs will result--XY--X--XX--Y. As a total result four kinds of eggs are\r\nexpected: viz. many XY and X eggs and a few XX and Y eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69. Figure of the chromosome group of an XXY female,\r\nthat gives non-disjunction.]\r\n\r\nThese four kinds of eggs may be fertilized either by female-producing\r\nsperms or male-producing sperms, as indicated in the diagram (fig. 70).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70. Scheme showing the results of fertilizing white\r\nbearing eggs (4 kinds) resulting from non-disjunction. The upper half of\r\nthe diagram gives the results when these eggs are fertilized by normal red\r\nbearing, female producing sperm, the lower half by normal, male producing\r\nsperm.]\r\n\r\nIf such an XXY female carried white bearing Xs (open X in the figures), and\r\nthe male carried a red bearing X (black X in the figures) it will be seen\r\nthat there should result an exceptional class of sons that are red, and an\r\nexceptional class of daughters that are white. Tests of these exceptions\r\nshow that they behave subsequently in heredity as their composition\r\nrequires. Other tests may also be made of the other classes of offspring.\r\nBridges has shown that they fulfill all the requirements predicted. Thus a\r\nresult that seemed in contradiction with the chromosome hypothesis has\r\nturned out to give a brilliant confirmation of that theory both genetically\r\nand cytologically.\r\n\r\nHOW MANY GENETIC FACTORS ARE THERE IN THE GERM-PLASM OF A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL\r\n\r\nIn passing I invite your attention to a speculation based on our maps of\r\nthe chromosomes--a speculation which I must insist does not pretend to be\r\nmore than a guess but has at least the interest of being the first guess\r\nthat we have ever been in position to make as to how many factors go\r\ntowards the makeup of the germ plasm.\r\n\r\nWe have found practically no factors less than .04 of a unit apart. If our\r\nmap includes the entire length of the chromosomes and if we assume factors\r\nare uniformly distributed along the chromosome at distances equal to the\r\nshortest distance yet observed, viz. .04, then we can calculate roughly how\r\nmany hereditary factors there are in Drosophila. The calculation gives\r\nabout 7500 factors. The reader should be cautioned against accepting the\r\nabove assumptions as strictly true, for crossing-over values are known to\r\ndiffer according to different environmental conditions (as shown by Bridges\r\nfor age), and to differ even in different parts of the chromosome as a\r\nresult of the presence of specific genetic factors (as shown by\r\nSturtevant). Since all the chromosomes except the X chromosomes are double\r\nwe must double our estimate to give the _total_ number of factors, but the\r\nhalf number is the number of the different kinds of factors of Drosophila.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nI have passed in review a long series of researches as to the nature of the\r\nhereditary material. We have in consequence of this work arrived within\r\nsight of a result that seemed a few years ago far beyond our reach. The\r\nmechanism of heredity has, I think, been discovered--discovered not by a\r\nflash of intuition but as the result of patient and careful study of the\r\nevidence itself.\r\n\r\nWith the discovery of this mechanism I venture the opinion that the problem\r\nof heredity has been solved. We know how the factors carried by the parents\r\nare sorted out to the germ cells. The explanation does not pretend to state\r\nhow factors arise or how they influence the development of the embryo. But\r\nthese have never been an integral part of the doctrine of heredity. The\r\nproblems which they present must be worked out in their own field. So, I\r\nrepeat, the mechanism of the chromosomes offers a satisfactory solution of\r\nthe traditional problem of heredity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSELECTION AND EVOLUTION\r\n\r\nDarwin's Theory of Natural Selection still holds today first place in every\r\ndiscussion of evolution, and for this very reason the theory calls for\r\ncareful scrutiny; for it is not difficult to show that the expression\r\n\"natural selection\" is to many men a metaphor that carries many meanings,\r\nand sometimes different meanings to different men. While I heartily agree\r\nwith my fellow biologists in ascribing to Darwin himself, and to his work,\r\nthe first place in biological philosophy, yet recognition of this claim\r\nshould not deter us from a careful analysis of the situation in the light\r\nof work that has been done since Darwin's time.\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION\r\n\r\nIn his great book on the _Origin of Species_, Darwin tried to do two\r\nthings: first, to show that the evidence bearing on evolution makes that\r\nexplanation probable. No such great body of evidence had ever been brought\r\ntogether before, and it wrought, as we all know, a revolution in our modes\r\nof thinking.\r\n\r\nDarwin also set himself the task of showing _how_ evolution might have\r\ntaken place. He pointed to the influence of the environment, to the effects\r\nof use and disuse, and to natural selection. It is to the last theory that\r\nhis name is especially attached. He appealed to a fact familiar to\r\neveryone, that no two individuals are identical and that some of the\r\ndifferences that they show are inherited. He argued that those individuals\r\nthat are best suited to their environment are the most probable ones to\r\nsurvive and to leave most offspring. In consequence their descendants\r\nshould in time replace through competition the less well-adapted\r\nindividuals of the species. This is the process Darwin called natural\r\nselection, and Spencer the survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nStated in these general terms there is nothing in the theory to which\r\nanyone is likely to take exception. But let us examine the argument more\r\ncritically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71. Series of leaves of a tree arranged according to\r\nsize. (After de Vries.)]\r\n\r\nIf we measure, or weigh, or classify any character shown by the individuals\r\nof a population, we find differences. We recognize that some of the\r\ndifferences are due to the varied experiences that the individuals have\r\nencountered in the course of their lives, i.e. to their environment, but we\r\nalso recognize that some of the differences may be due to individuals\r\nhaving different inheritances--different germ plasms. Some familiar\r\nexamples will help to bring home this relation.\r\n\r\nIf the leaves of a tree are arranged according to size (fig. 71), we find a\r\ncontinuous series, but there are more leaves of medium size than extremes.\r\nIf a lot of beans be sorted out according to their weights, and those\r\nbetween certain weights put into cylinders, the cylinders, when arranged\r\naccording to the size of the beans, will appear as shown in figure 72. An\r\nimaginary line running over the tops of the piles will give a curve (fig.\r\n73) that corresponds to the curve of probability (fig. 74).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72. Beans put into cylindrical jars according to the\r\nsizes of the beans. The jars arranged according to size of contained beans.\r\n(After de Vries.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73. A curve resulting from arrangement of beans\r\naccording to size. (After de Vries.)]\r\n\r\nIf we stand men in lines according to their height (fig. 75) we get a\r\nsimilar arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74. Curve of probability.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75. Students arranged according to size. (After\r\nBlakeslee.)]\r\n\r\nThe differences in size shown by the individual beans or by the individual\r\nmen are due in part to heredity, in part to the environment in which they\r\nhave developed. This is a familiar fact of almost every-day observation. It\r\nis well shown in the following example. In figure 76 the two boys and the\r\ntwo varieties of corn, which they are holding, differ in height. The\r\npedigrees of the boys (fig. 77) make it probable that their height is\r\nlargely inherited and the two races of corn are known to belong to a tall\r\nand a short race respectively. Here, then, the chief effect or difference\r\nis due to heredity. On the other hand, if individuals of the same race\r\ndevelop in a favorable environment the result is different from the\r\ndevelopment in an unfavorable environment, as shown in figure 78. Here to\r\nthe right the corn is crowded and in consequence dwarfed, while to the left\r\nthe same kind of corn has had more room to develop and is taller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76. A short and a tall boy each holding a stalk of\r\ncorn--one stalk of a race of short corn, the other of tall corn. (After\r\nBlakeslee.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77. Pedigree of boys shown in Fig. 76. (After\r\nBlakeslee.)]\r\n\r\nDarwin knew that if selection of particular kinds of individuals of a\r\npopulation takes place the next generation is affected. If the taller men\r\nof a community are selected _the average_ of their offspring will be taller\r\nthan the average of the former population. If selection for tallness again\r\ntakes place, still taller men will _on the average_ arise. If, amongst\r\nthese, selection again makes a choice the process would, he thought,\r\ncontinue (fig. 79).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78. A race of corn reared under different conditions.]\r\n\r\nWe now recognize that this statement contains an important truth, but we\r\nhave found that it contains only a part of the truth. Any one who repeats\r\nfor himself this kind of selection experiment will find that while his\r\naverage class will often change in the direction of his selection, the\r\nprocess slows down as a rule rather suddenly (fig. 80). He finds, moreover,\r\nthat the limits of variability are not necessarily transcended as the\r\nprocess continues even although the average may for a while be increased.\r\nMore tall men may be produced by selection of this kind, but the tallest\r\nmen are not necessarily any taller than the tallest in the original\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79. Curves showing how (hypothetically) selection might\r\nbe supposed to bring about progress in direction of selection. (After\r\nGoldschmidt.)]\r\n\r\nSelection, then, has not produced anything new, but only more of certain\r\nkinds of individuals. Evolution, however, means producing more new things,\r\nnot more of what already exists.\r\n\r\nDarwin seems to have thought that the range of variation shown by the\r\noffspring of a given individual about that type of individual would be as\r\nwide as the range shown by the original population (fig. 79), but Galton's\r\nwork has made it clear that this is not the case in a general or mixed\r\npopulation. If the offspring of individuals continued to show, as Darwin\r\nseems to have thought, as wide a range on each side of their parents' size,\r\nso to speak, as did the original population, then it would follow that\r\nselection could slide successive generations along in the direction of\r\nselection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80. Diagram illustrating the results of selection for\r\nextra bristles in D. ampelophila. Selection at first produces decided\r\neffects which soon slow down and then cease. (MacDowell.)]\r\n\r\nDarwin himself was extraordinarily careful, however, in the statements he\r\nmade in this connection and it is rather by implication than by actual\r\nreference that one can ascribe this meaning to his views. His\r\ncontemporaries and many of his followers, however, appear to have accepted\r\nthis _sliding scale_ interpretation as the cardinal doctrine of evolution.\r\nIf this is doubted or my statement is challenged then one must explain why\r\nde Vries' mutation theory met with so little enthusiasm amongst the older\r\ngroup of zoölogists and botanists; and one must explain why Johannsen's\r\nsplendid work met with such bitter opposition from the English school--the\r\nbiometricians--who amongst the post-Darwinian school are assumed to be the\r\nlineal descendants of Darwin.\r\n\r\nAnd in this connection we should not forget that just this sort of process\r\nwas supposed to take place in the inheritance of use and disuse. What is\r\ngained in one generation forms the basis for further gains in the next\r\ngeneration. Now, Darwin not only believed that acquired characters are\r\ninherited but turned more and more to this explanation in his later\r\nwritings. Let us, however, not make too much of the matter; for it is much\r\nless important to find out whether Darwin's ideas were vague, than it is to\r\nmake sure that our own ideas are clear.\r\n\r\nIf I have made several statements here that appear dogmatic let me now\r\nattempt to justify them, or at least give the evidence which seems to me to\r\nmake them probable.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Danish botanist, Johannsen, has given us the most carefully\r\nanalyzed case of selection that has ever been obtained. There are,\r\nmoreover, special reasons why the material that he used is better suited to\r\ngive definite information than any other so far studied. Johannsen worked\r\nwith the common bean, weighing the seeds or else measuring them. These\r\nbeans if taken from many plants at random give the typical curve of\r\nprobability (fig. 74). The plant multiplies by self-fertilization. Taking\r\nadvantage of this fact Johannsen kept the seeds of each plant separate from\r\nthe others, and raised from them a new generation. When curves were made\r\nfrom these new groups it was found that some of them had different modes\r\nfrom that of the original general population (fig. 81 A-E, bottom group).\r\nThey are shown in the upper groups (A, B, C, D, E). But do not understand\r\nme to say that the offspring of each bean gave a different mode.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81. Pure lines of beans. The lower figure gives the\r\ngeneral population, the other figures give the pure lines within the\r\npopulation. (After Johannsen.)]\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, some of the lines would be the same.\r\n\r\nThe result means that the general population is made up of definite kinds\r\nof individuals that may have been sorted out.\r\n\r\nThat his conclusion is correct is shown by rearing a new generation from\r\nany plant or indeed from several plants of any one of these lines. Each\r\nline repeats the same modal class. There is no further breaking up into\r\ngroups. Within the line it does not matter at all whether one chooses a big\r\nbean or a little one--they will give the same result. In a word, the germ\r\nplasm in each of these lines is pure, or homozygous, as we say. The\r\ndifferences that we find between the weights (or sizes) of the individual\r\nbeans are due to external conditions to which they have been subjected.\r\n\r\nIn a word, Johannsen's work shows that the frequency distribution of a pure\r\nline is due to factors that are extrinsic to the germ plasm. It does not\r\nmatter then which individuals in a pure line are used to breed from, for\r\nthey all carry the same germ plasm.\r\n\r\nWe can now understand more clearly how selection acting on a general\r\npopulation brings about results in the direction of selection.\r\n\r\nAn individual is picked out from the population in order to get a\r\nparticular kind of germ plasm. Although the different classes of\r\nindividuals may overlap, so that one can not always judge an individual\r\nfrom its appearance, nevertheless on the whole chance favors the picking\r\nout of the kind of germ plasm sought.\r\n\r\nIn species with separate sexes there is the further difficulty that two\r\nindividuals must be chosen for each mating, and superficial examination of\r\nthem does not insure that they belong to the same group--their germ plasm\r\ncannot be inspected. Hence selection of biparental forms is a precarious\r\nprocess, now going forward, now backwards, now standing still. In time,\r\nhowever, the process forward is almost certain to take place if the\r\nselection is from a heterogeneous population. Johannsen's work was\r\nsimplified because he started with pure lines. In fact, had he not done so\r\nhis work would not have been essentially different from that of any\r\nselection experiment of a pure race of animals or plants. Whether Johannsen\r\nrealized the importance of the condition or not is uncertain--curiously he\r\nlaid no emphasis on it in the first edition of his \"Elemente der exakten\r\nErblichkeitslehre\".\r\n\r\nIt has since been pointed out by Jennings and by Pearl that a race that\r\nreproduces by self-fertilization as does this bean, automatically becomes\r\npure in all of the factors that make up its germ plasm. Since\r\nself-fertilization is the normal process in this bean the purity of the\r\ngerm plasm already existed when Johannsen began to experiment.\r\n\r\nHOW HAS SELECTION IN DOMESTICATED ANIMALS AND PLANTS BROUGHT ABOUT ITS\r\nRESULTS?\r\n\r\nIf then selection does not bring about transgressive variation in a general\r\npopulation, how can selection produce anything new? If it can not produce\r\nanything new, is there any other way in which selection becomes an agent in\r\nevolution?\r\n\r\nWe can get some light on this question if we turn to what man has done with\r\nhis domesticated animals and plants. Through selection, i.e., artificial\r\nselection, man has undoubtedly brought about changes as remarkable as any\r\nshown by wild animals and plants. We know, moreover, a good deal about how\r\nthese changes have been wrought.\r\n\r\n(1) By crossing different wild species or by crossing wild with races\r\nalready domesticated new combinations have been made. Parts of one\r\nindividual have been combined with parts of others, creating new\r\ncombinations. It is possible even that characters that are entirely new may\r\nbe produced by the interaction of factors brought into recombination.\r\n\r\n(2) New characters appear from time to time in domesticated and in wild\r\nspecies. These, like the mutants in Drosophila, are fully equipped at the\r\nstart. Since they breed true and follow Mendel's laws it is possible to\r\ncombine them with characters of the wild type or with those of other mutant\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nAmongst the new mutant factors there may be some whose chief effect is on\r\nthe character that the breeder is already selecting. Such a modification\r\nwill be likely to attract attention. Superficially it may appear that the\r\nfactor for the original character has varied, while the truth may be that\r\nanother factor has appeared that has modified a character already present.\r\nIn fact, many or all Mendelian factors that affect the same organ may be\r\nsaid to be modifiers of each other's effects. Thus the factor for vermilion\r\ncauses the eye to be one color, and the factor for eosin another color,\r\nwhile eosin vermilion is different from both. Eosin may be said to be a\r\nmodifier of vermilion or vermilion of eosin. In general, however, it is\r\nconvenient to use the term \"modifier\" for cases in which the factor causes\r\na detectable change in a character already present or conspicuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82. Scheme to indicate influence of the modifying\r\nfactors, cream and whiting. Neither produces any effect alone but they\r\nmodify other eye colors such as eosin.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting, and at the same time most treacherous, kinds\r\nof modifying factors is that which produces an effect _only_ when some\r\nother factor is present. Thus Bridges has shown that there is a factor\r\ncalled \"cream\" that does not affect the red color of the eye of the wild\r\nfly, yet makes \"eosin\" much paler (fig. 82). Another factor \"whiting\" which\r\nproduces no effect on red makes eosin entirely white. Since cream or\r\nwhiting may be carried by red eyed flies without their presence being seen\r\nuntil eosin is used, the experimenter must be continually on the lookout\r\nfor such factors which may lead to erroneous conclusions unless detected.\r\nAs yet breeders have not realized the important rôle that modifiers have\r\nplayed in their results, but there are indications at least that the\r\nheaping up of modifying factors has been one of the ways in which highly\r\nspecialized domesticated animals have been produced. Selection has\r\naccomplished this result not by changing factors, but by picking up\r\nmodifying factors. The demonstration of the presence of these factors has\r\nalready been made in some cases. Their study promises to be one of the most\r\ninstructive fields for further work bearing on the selection hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these well recognized methods by which artificial selection\r\nhas produced new things we come now to a question that is the very crux of\r\nthe selection theory today. Our whole conception of selection turns on the\r\nanswer that we give to this matter and if I appear insistent and go into\r\nsome detail it is because I think that the matter is worth very careful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nARE FACTORS CHANGED THROUGH SELECTION?\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the variation that we find from individual to individual\r\nis due in part to the environment; this can generally be demonstrated.\r\nOther differences in an ordinary population are recognized as due to\r\ndifferent genetic (hereditary) combinations. No one will dispute this\r\nstatement. But is all the variability accounted for in these two ways? May\r\nnot a factor itself fluctuate? Is it not _a priori_ probable that factors\r\ndo fluctuate? Why, in a word, should we regard factors as inviolate when we\r\nsee that everything else in organisms is more or less in amount? I do not\r\nknow of any _a priori_ reason why a factor may not fluctuate, unless it is,\r\nas I like to think, a chemical molecule. We are, however, dealing here not\r\nwith generalities but with evidence, and there are three known methods by\r\nmeans of which it has been shown that variability, other than environmental\r\nor recombinational, is not due to variability in a factor, nor to various\r\n\"potencies\" possessed by the same factors.\r\n\r\n(1) By making the stock uniform for all of its factors--chief factors and\r\nmodifiers alike. Any change in such a stock produced by selection would\r\nthen be due to a change in one or more of the factors themselves.\r\nJohannsen's experiment is an example of this sort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83 a. Drosophila ampelophila with truncate wings.]\r\n\r\n(2) The second method is one that is capable of _demonstrating_ that the\r\neffects of selection are actually due to modifiers. It has been worked out\r\nin our laboratory, chiefly by Muller, and used in a particular case to\r\ndemonstrate that selection produced its effect by isolating modifying\r\nfactors. For example, a mutant type called truncate appeared, characterized\r\nby shorter wings, usually square at the end, (fig. 83a). The wings varied\r\nfrom those of normal length to wings much shorter (fig. 83b). For three\r\nyears the mutant stock was bred from individuals having the shorter wings\r\nuntil at last a stock was obtained in which some of the individuals had\r\nwings much shorter than the body. By means of linkage experiments it was\r\nshown that at least three factors were present that modified the wings.\r\nThese were isolated by means of their linkage relations, and their mutual\r\ninfluence on the production of truncate wings was shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83 b. Series of wings of different length shown by\r\ntruncate stock of D. ampelophila.]\r\n\r\nAn experiment of this kind can only be carried out in a case where the\r\ngroups of linked gens are known. At present Drosophila is the only animal\r\n(or plant) sufficiently well known to make this test possible, but this\r\ndoes not prove that the method is of no value. On the contrary it shows\r\nthat any claim that factors can themselves be changed can have no finality\r\nuntil the claim can be tested out by means of the linkage test. For\r\ninstance, bar eye (fig. 31) arose as a mutation. All our stock has\r\ndescended from a single original mutant. But Zeleny has shown that\r\nselection within our stock will make the bar eye narrower or broader\r\naccording to the direction of selection. It remains to be shown in this\r\ncase how selection has produced its effects, and this can be done by\r\nutilizing the same process that was used in the case of truncate.\r\n\r\nAnother mutant stock called beaded (fig. 84), has been bred for five years\r\nand selected for wings showing more beading. In extreme cases the wings\r\nhave been reduced to mere stumps (see stumpy, fig. 5), but the stock shows\r\ngreat variability. It is probable here as Dexter has shown, that a number\r\nof mutant factors that act as modifiers have been picked up in the course\r\nof the selection, and when it is recalled that during those five years over\r\n125 new characters have appeared elsewhere it does not seem improbable that\r\nfactors also have appeared that modify the wings of this stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84. Two flies showing beaded wings.]\r\n\r\n(3) The third method is one that has been developed principally by East for\r\nplants; also by MacDowell for rabbits and flies. The method does not claim\r\nto prove that modifiers are present, but it shows why certain results are\r\nin harmony with that expectation and can not be accounted for on the basis\r\nthat a factor has changed. Let me give an example. When a Belgian hare with\r\nlarge body was crossed to a common rabbit with a small body the hybrid was\r\nintermediate in size. When the hybrid was crossed back to the smaller type\r\nit produced rabbits of various sizes in apparently a continuous series.\r\nMacDowell made measurements of the range of variability in the first and in\r\nthe second generations.\r\n\r\n    _Classification in relation to parents based on skull lengths and ulna\r\n    lengths, to show the relative variability of two measurements and of\r\n    the first generation (F_1) and the back cross (B.

This is what is expected if several\r\nfactor-differences were involved, because the hybrids of the first\r\ngeneration are expected to be more uniform in factorial composition than\r\nare those in the second generation which are produced by recombination of\r\nthe factors introduced through their grandparents. Excellent illustrations\r\nof the same kinds of results have been found in Indian corn. As shown in\r\nfigure 85 the length of the cob in F_1 is intermediate between the parent\r\ntypes while in F_2 the range is wider and both of the original types are\r\nrecovered. East states that similar relations have been found for 18\r\ncharacters in corn. Emerson has recently furnished further illustrations of\r\nthe same relations in the length of stalks in beans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85. Cross between two races of Indian corn, one with\r\nshort cobs and one with long cobs. The range of variability in F_1 is less\r\nthan that in F_2. (After East.)]\r\n\r\nA similar case is shown by a cross between fantail and common pigeons (fig.\r\n86). The latter have twelve feathers in the tail, while the selected race\r\nfrom which the fantails came had between 28 and 38 feathers in the tail.\r\nThe F_1 offspring (forty-one individuals) showed (fig. 87) between 12 and\r\n20 tail feathers, while in F_2 the numbers varied between 12 and 25. Here\r\none of the grand-parental types reappears in large numbers, while the\r\nextreme of the other grand-parental type did not reappear (in the counts\r\nobtained), although the F_2 number would probably overlap the lower limits\r\nof the race of fantail grandparents had not a selected (surviving) lot been\r\ntaken for the figures given in the table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86. Cross of pigeon with normal tail P_1 and fantail\r\nP_1; F_1, bird below.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87. Cross of normal and fantail pigeons. (See Fig. 86.)\r\nThe F_2 range is wider than that of F_1. The normal grand-parental type of\r\n12 feathers was recovered in F_2 but the higher numbers characteristic of\r\nfantails were not recovered.]\r\n\r\nThe preceding account attempts to point out how I should prefer to\r\ninterpret the problem of selection in the light of the most recent work on\r\nbreeding. But I would give a very incomplete account of the whole situation\r\nif I neglected to include some important work which has led some of my\r\nfellow-workers to a very different conclusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88. Scheme to show classes of hooded rats used by\r\nCastle. (After Castle.)]\r\n\r\nCastle in particular is the champion of a view based on his results with\r\nhooded rats. Starting with individuals which have a narrow black stripe\r\ndown the back he selected for a narrower stripe in one direction and for a\r\nbroader stripe in the other. As the diagram shows (fig. 88) Castle has\r\nsucceeded in producing in one direction a race in which the dorsal stripe\r\nhas disappeared and in the other direction a race in which the black has\r\nextended over the back and sides, leaving only a white mark on the belly.\r\nNeither of these extremes occurs, he believes, in the ordinary hooded race\r\nof domesticated rats. In other words no matter how many of them came under\r\nobservation the extreme types of his experiment would not be found.\r\n\r\nCastle claims that the factor for hoodedness must be a single Mendelian\r\nunit, because if hooded rats are crossed to wild gray rats with uniform\r\ncoat and their offspring are inbred there are produced in F_2 three uniform\r\nrats to one hooded rat. Castle advances the hypothesis that factors--by\r\nwhich he means Mendelian factors--may themselves vary in much the same way\r\nas do the characters that they stand for. He argues, in so many words, that\r\nsince we judge a factor by the kind of character it produces, when the\r\ncharacter varies the factor that stands for it may have changed.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1903 Cuénot had carried out experiments with spotted mice\r\nsimilar to those of Castle with rats. Cuénot found that spotted crossed to\r\nuniform coat color gave in F_2 a ratio of three uniform to one spotted, yet\r\nselection of those spotted mice with more white in their coat produced mice\r\nin successive generations that had more and more white. Conversely Cuénot\r\nshowed that selection of those spotted mice that had more color in their\r\ncoat produced mice with more and more color and less white. Cuénot does not\r\nhowever bring up in this connection the question as to how selection in\r\nthese spotted mice brings about its results.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to discuss these results at the length that they deserve\r\nlet me briefly state why I think Castle's evidence fails to establish his\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nIn the first place one of the premises may be wrong. The three to one ratio\r\nin F_2 by no means proves that all conditions of hoodedness are due to one\r\nfactor. The result shows at most that one factor that gives the hooded\r\ntypes is a simple Mendelian factor. The changes in this type may be caused\r\nby modifying factors that can show an effect only when hoodedness is itself\r\npresent. That this is not an imaginary objection but a real one is shown by\r\nan experiment that Castle himself made which furnishes the ground for the\r\nsecond objection.\r\n\r\nSecond. If the factor has really changed its potency, then if a very dark\r\nindividual from one end of the series is crossed to a wild rat and the\r\nsecond generation raised we should expect that the hooded F_2 rats would\r\nall be dark like their dark grandparent. When Castle made this test he\r\nfound that there were many grades of hooded rats in the F_2 progeny. They\r\nwere darker, it is true, as a group than were the original hooded group at\r\nthe beginning of the selection experiment, but they gave many intermediate\r\ngrades. Castle attempts to explain this by the assumption that the factor\r\nmade pure by selection became contaminated by its normal allelomorph in the\r\nF_1 parent, but not only does this assumption appear to beg the whole\r\nquestion, but it is in flat contradiction with what we have observed in\r\nhundreds of Mendelian cases where no evidence for such a contamination\r\nexists.\r\n\r\nLater Castle crossed some of the extracted rats of average grade (3.01)\r\nfrom the plus series to the same wild race and got F_2 hooded rats from\r\nthis cross. These F_2 hooded rats did not further approach the ordinary\r\nrange but were nearer the extreme selected plus hooded rats (3.33) than\r\nwere the F_2's extracted from the first cross (2.59). Castle concludes from\r\nthis that multiple factors can not account for the result. As a matter of\r\nfact, Castle's evidence _as published_ does not establish his conclusion\r\nbecause the wild rats used in the second experiment may have carried plus\r\nmodifiers. This could only be determined by suitable tests which Castle\r\ndoes not furnish. This is the crucial point, without which the evidence\r\ncarries no conviction.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, from Castle's point of view, these latest results would seem\r\nto increase the difficulty of interpretation of his first F_2 extracted\r\ncross, and it is now the first result that calls for explanation if one\r\naccepts his later conclusion.\r\n\r\nThese and other objections that might be taken up show, I think, that\r\nCastle's experiment with hooded rats fails entirely to establish his\r\ncontention of change in potency of the germ or of contamination of factors,\r\nwhile on the contrary they are in entire accord with the view that he is\r\ndealing with a case of modifying factors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89. Races of Paramecium. (After Jennings.)]\r\n\r\nEqually important are the results that Jennings has obtained with certain\r\nprotozoa. Paramecium multiplies by dividing across in the middle, each half\r\nreplacing its lacking part. Both the small nucleus (micronucleus) and the\r\nlarge nucleus (macronucleus) divide at each division of the body. Jennings\r\nfound that while individuals descended from a single paramecium vary in\r\nsize (fig. 89), yet the population from a large individual is the same as\r\nthe population derived from a small individual. In other words, selection\r\nproduces no result and the probable explanation is, of course, that the\r\ndifferent sizes of individuals are due to the environment, while the\r\nconstancy of the type is genetic. Jennings found a number of races of\r\nparamecium of different sizes living under natural conditions. The largest\r\nindividual of a small race might overlap the smallest individual of other\r\nlarger races (fig. 89); nevertheless each kind reproduced its particular\r\nrace. The results are like those of Johannsen in a general way, but differ\r\nin that reproduction takes place in paramecium by direct division instead\r\nof through self-fertilization as in beans, and also in that the paramecia\r\nwere probably not homozygous. Since, however, so far as known no\r\n\"reduction\" takes place in paramecium at each division, the genetic\r\ncomposition of parent and offspring should be the same. Whether\r\npseudo-parthenogenesis that Woodruff and Erdmann have found occurring in\r\nparamecium at intervals involves a redistribution of the hereditary factors\r\nis not clear. Jennings's evidence seems incompatible with such a view.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90. Stylonychia showing division into two. (After\r\nStein.)]\r\n\r\nMore recently one of Jennings's students, Middleton, has made a careful\r\nseries of selection experiments with Stylonychia (fig. 90) in which he\r\nselected for lines showing more rapid or slower rates of division. His\r\nobservations seem to show that his selection separated two such lines that\r\ncame from the same original stock. The rapidity of the effects of selection\r\nseems to preclude the explanation that pseudo-parthenogenesis has\r\ncomplicated the results. Nevertheless, the results are of such a kind as to\r\nsuggest that they were due to selection of vegetative (somatic) differences\r\nand that no genetic change of factors was involved, for his conclusion that\r\nthe rapidity with which the effects gained by long selection might be\r\nsuddenly reversed when selection was reversed is hardly consistent with an\r\ninterpretation of the results based on changes in the \"potencies\" of the\r\nfactors present.\r\n\r\nEqually striking are the interesting experiments that Jennings has recently\r\ncarried out with Difflugia (fig. 91). This protozoon secretes a shell about\r\nitself which has a characteristic shape, and often carries spines. The\r\nopening at one end of the shell through which the protoplasm protrudes to\r\nmake the pseudopodia is surrounded by a rim having a characteristic\r\npattern. The protoplasm contains several nuclei and in addition there is\r\nscattered material or particles called chromidia that are supposed to be\r\nchromatic in nature and related to the material of the nuclei, possibly by\r\ndirect interchange.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91. Difflugia Corona. (After Cash.)]\r\n\r\nWhen Difflugia divides, part of the protoplasm protrudes from the opening\r\nand a new shell is secreted about this mass which becomes a daughter\r\nindividual. The behavior of the nucleus and of the chromidia at this time\r\nis obscure, but there is some evidence that their materials may be\r\nirregularly distributed between parent and offspring. If this is correct,\r\nand if in the protozoa the chromatin has the same influence that it seems\r\nto have in higher animals, the mode of reproduction in Difflugia would be\r\nexpected to give little more than random sampling of the germ plasm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92. Races of Difflugia. (After Leidy.)]\r\n\r\nJennings was able by means of selection to get from the descendants of one\r\noriginal individual a number of different types that themselves bred true,\r\nexcept in so far as selection could affect another change in them. In this\r\nconnection it is interesting to note that Leidy has published figures of\r\nDifflugia (fig. 92) that show that a great many \"types\" exist. If through\r\nsexual union (a process that occurs in Difflugia) the germ plasm\r\n(chromatin) of these wild types has in times past been recombined, then\r\nselection would be expected to separate certain types again, if, at\r\ndivision, irregular sampling of the germ plasm takes place. Until these\r\npoints are settled the bearing of these important experiments of Jennings\r\non the general problem of selection is uncertain.\r\n\r\nHOW DOES NATURAL SELECTION INFLUENCE THE COURSE OF EVOLUTION?\r\n\r\nThe question still remains: Does selection play any rôle in evolution, and,\r\nif so, in what sense? Does the elimination of the unfit influence the\r\ncourse of evolution, except in the negative sense of leaving more room for\r\nthe fit? There is something further to be said in this connection, although\r\nopinions may differ as to whether the following interpretation of the term\r\n\"natural selection\" is the only possible one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93. Evolution of elephant's skulls. (After Dendy.)]\r\n\r\nIf through a mutation a character appears that is neither advantageous nor\r\ndisadvantageous, but indifferent, the chance that it may become established\r\nin the race is extremely small, although by good luck such a thing may\r\noccur rarely. It makes no difference whether the character in question is a\r\ndominant or a recessive one, the chance of its becoming established is\r\nexactly the same. If through a mutation a character appears that has an\r\n_injurious_ effect, however slight this may be, it has practically no\r\nchance of becoming established.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94. Evolution of elephant's trunk. (After Lull.)]\r\n\r\nIf through a mutation a character appears that has a _beneficial_ influence\r\non the individual, the chance that the individual will survive is\r\nincreased, not only for itself, but for all of its descendants that come to\r\ninherit this character. It is this increase in the number of individuals\r\npossessing a particular character, that might have an influence on the\r\ncourse of evolution. This gives a better chance for improvement by several\r\nsuccessive steps; but not because the species is more likely to mutate\r\nagain in the same direction. An imaginary example will illustrate how this\r\nhappens: When elephants had trunks less than a foot long, the chance of\r\ngetting trunks more than one foot long was in proportion to the length of\r\ntrunks already present and to the number of individuals; but increment in\r\ntrunk length is no more likely to occur from an animal having a trunk more\r\nthan one foot long than from an animal with a shorter trunk.\r\n\r\nThe case is analogous to tossing pennies. At any stage in the game the\r\nchance of accumulating a hundred heads is in proportion to the number of\r\nheads already obtained, and to the number of throws still to be made. But\r\nthe number of heads obtained has no influence on the number of heads that\r\nwill appear in the next throw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95. Evolution of elephant's trunk: above Maeritherium,\r\nin the middle Tetrabelodon (After Lancaster); below African elephants\r\n(After Gambier Bolton).]\r\n\r\nOwing then to this property of the germ plasm to duplicate itself in a\r\nlarge number of samples not only is an opportunity furnished to an\r\nadvantageous variation to become extensively multiplied, but the presence\r\nof a large number of individuals of a given sort prejudices the probable\r\nfuture result.\r\n\r\nThe question may be raised as to whether it is desirable to call selection\r\na _creative_ process. There are so many supernatural and mystical\r\nimplications that hang around the term creative that one can not be too\r\ncareful in stating in what sense the term is to be used. If by creative is\r\nmeant that something is made out of nothing, then of course there is no\r\nneed for the scientist to try to answer such a question. But if by a\r\ncreative process is meant that something is made out of something else,\r\nthen there are two alternatives to be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nFirst, if it were true that selection of an individual of a certain kind\r\ndetermines that new variations in the same direction occur as a consequence\r\nof the selection, then selection would certainly be creative. How this\r\ncould occur might be quite unintelligible, but of course it might be\r\nclaimed that the point is not whether we can explain how creation takes\r\nplace, but whether we can get verifiable evidence that such a kind of thing\r\nhappens. This possibility is disposed of by the fact that there is no\r\nevidence that selection determines the direction in which variation occurs.\r\n\r\nSecond, if you mean by a creative process that by picking out a certain\r\nkind of individual and multiplying its numbers a better chance is furnished\r\nthat a certain end result will be obtained, such a process may be said to\r\nbe creative. This is, I think, the proper use of the term creative in a\r\nmechanistic sense.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the evidence relating to selection I have tried to handle the\r\nproblem as objectively as I could.\r\n\r\nThe evidence shows clearly that the characters of wild animals and plants,\r\nas well as those of domesticated races, are inherited both in the wild and\r\nin the domesticated forms according to Mendel's Law.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the mutations that give rise to new characters we do not\r\nknow, although we have no reason for supposing that they are due to other\r\nthan natural processes.\r\n\r\nEvolution has taken place by the incorporation into the race of those\r\nmutations that are beneficial to the life and reproduction of the organism.\r\nNatural selection as here defined means both the increase in the number of\r\nindividuals that results after a beneficial mutation has occurred (owing to\r\nthe ability of living matter to propagate) and also that this preponderance\r\nof certain kinds of individuals in a population makes some further results\r\nmore probable than others. More than this, natural selection can not mean,\r\nif factors are fixed and are not changed by selection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n        INDEX\r\n\r\n  Abnormal
