It is to be regretted, that a man of so remarkable a\r\ncharacter, did not leave the world some record of a life offering points\r\nof interest different from that of any of his contemporaries, from the\r\npeculiarly studious retirement and eccentric avocations in which it was\r\nchiefly passed.  Such a memoir would have formed a curious contrast with\r\nthat of the late M. de Chateaubriand, who, born nearly at the same\r\nperiod, outlived but by a few years, the strange Englishman, whose famous\r\nromance forms a brilliant ornament to French literature, which even Atala\r\nis unlikely to outlive in the memory of Chateaubriand’s countrymen.  All\r\nmen of genius should write autobiographies.  Such works are inestimable\r\nlessons to posterity.  As it is, there are few men, of whom it is more\r\ndifficult to compose an elaborate and detailed history than the author of\r\n“Vathek.”  From such scanty sources as are open to us, the reader must be\r\ncontent with a few striking facts and illustrations, which may serve to\r\nconvey some idea of the idiosyncrasy of a man, whose whole life was a\r\nsort of mystery, even to his personal acquaintances.\r\n\r\nHis great-great-grandfather was lieutenant-governor and commander of the\r\nforces in Jamaica; and his grandfather president of the council in the\r\nsame island.  His father, though not a merchant, as has been represented,\r\nbut a large landed proprietor, both in England and the West Indies, was\r\nlord mayor of London, and distinguished himself in presenting an address\r\nto the king, George the Third,—by a spirited retort to his majesty,—who\r\nhad the ill-breeding to treat discourteously a deputation which the lord\r\nmayor headed.  The portraits of Alderman Beckford, and his more\r\ncelebrated son, were painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds.  The former died in\r\n1770, leaving the subject of this memoir the wealthiest commoner in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nNo pains were spared on the education of the young Croesus—the lords\r\nChatham and Camden being consulted by his father on that subject.\r\nBesides Latin and Greek, he spoke five modern languages, and wrote three\r\nwith facility and elegance.  He read Persian and Arabic, designed with\r\ngreat skill, and studied the science of music under the great Mozart.\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighteen he visited Paris, and was introduced to Voltaire.\r\n“On taking leave of me,” said Beckford, “he placed his hand on my head,\r\nsaying, ‘There, young Englishman, I give you the blessing of a very old\r\nman.’  Voltaire was a mere skeleton—a bony anatomy.  His countenance I\r\nshall never forget.”\r\n\r\nHis first literary production, “Memoirs of Extraordinary Painters,” was\r\nwritten at the early age of seventeen.  It would appear, that the old\r\nhousekeeper at Fonthill, was in the habit of edifying visitors to its\r\npicture gallery by a description of the paintings, mainly derived from\r\nher own fertile imagination.  This suggested to our author, the humorous\r\nidea of composing a catalogue of suppositious painters with histories of\r\neach, equally fanciful and grotesque.  Henceforward, the old housekeeper\r\nhad a printed guide (or rather, mis-guider) to go by, and could discourse\r\nat large on the merits of Og of Bashan! Waterslouchy of Amsterdam! and\r\nHerr Sucrewasser of Vienna! their wives and styles!  As for the country\r\nsquires, etc., “they,” Beckford tells us, “took all for gospel.”\r\n\r\n“Vathek,”—the superb “Vathek,” which Lord Byron so much admired, and on\r\nwhich he so frequently complimented the author,—“Vathek,” the finest of\r\nOriental romances, as “Lallah Rookh” is the first of Oriental poems, by\r\nthe pen of a “Frank,” was written and published before our author had\r\ncompleted his twentieth year, it having been composed at a _single\r\nsitting_!  Yes, for three days and two nights did the indefatigable\r\nauthor persevere in his task.  He completed it, and a serious illness was\r\nthe result.  What other literary man ever equalled this feat of rapidity\r\nand genius?\r\n\r\n“Vathek” was originally written in French, of which its style is a model.\r\nThe translation which follows, is not by the author himself, though he\r\nexpressed perfect satisfaction with it.  It was originally published in\r\n1786.  For splendour of description, exquisite humour, and supernatural\r\ninterest and grandeur, it stands without a rival in romance.  In as\r\nthoroughly Oriental keeping, Hope’s “Anastasius, or Memoirs of a Modern\r\nGreek,” which Beckford himself highly admired, can alone be compared with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMuch of the description of Vathek’s palace, and even the renowned “Hall\r\nof Eblis,” was afterwards visibly embodied in the real Fonthill Abbey, of\r\nwhich wonders, almost as fabulous, were at one time reported and\r\nbelieved.\r\n\r\nFonthill Abbey, which had been destroyed by fire, and re-built during the\r\nlife-time of the elder Beckford, was on account of its bad site\r\ndemolished, and again re-built under the superintendence of our author\r\nhimself, assisted by James Wyatt, Esq., the architect, with a\r\nmagnificence that excited the greatest attention and wonder at the time.\r\nThe total outlay of building Fonthill, including furniture, articles of\r\nvirtu, etc., must have been enormous, not much within the million, as\r\nestimated by the “Times.”  A writer in the “Athenæum” mentions £400,000\r\nas the sum.  Beckford informed Mr. Cyrus Redding, that the exact cost of\r\nbuilding Fonthill was £273,000.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing architectural peculiarity of Fonthill Abbey, was a\r\nlofty tower, 280 feet in height.  This tower was prominently shadowed\r\nforth in “Vathek,” and shows how strong a hold the idea had upon his\r\nmind.  Such was his impatience to see Fonthill completed, that he had the\r\nworks continued by torchlight, with relays of workmen.  During the\r\nprogress of the building, the tower caught fire, and was partly\r\ndestroyed.  The owner, however, was present, and enjoyed the magnificent\r\nburning spectacle.  It was soon restored; but a radical fault in laying\r\nthe foundation, caused it eventually to fall down, and leave Fonthill a\r\nruin in the life-time of its founder.\r\n\r\nNot so much his extravagant mode of life, which is the common notion, as\r\nthe loss of two large estates in a law suit (the value of which may be\r\ninferred from the fact, that _fifteen hundred slaves_ were upon them)\r\ninduced our author to quit Fonthill, and offer it and its contents for\r\npublic sale.  There was a general desire to see the interior of the\r\npalace, in which its lord had lived in a luxurious seclusion, so little\r\nadmired by the curious of the fashionable world.  “He is fortunate,” says\r\nthe “Times” of 1822, “who finds a vacant chair within twenty miles of\r\nFonthill; the solitude of a private apartment is a luxury which few can\r\nhope for.” . . .  “Falstaff himself could not _take his ease_ at this\r\nmoment within a dozen leagues of Fonthill.” . . . “The beds through the\r\ncounty are (literally) doing double duty—people who come in from a\r\ndistance during the night must wait to go to bed until others get up in\r\nthe morning.” . . . “Not a farm-house, however humble,—not a cottage near\r\nFonthill, but gives shelter to fashion, to beauty, and rank; ostrich\r\nplumes, which, by their very waving, we can trace back to Piccadilly, are\r\nseen nodding at a casement window over a depopulated poultry-yard.”\r\n\r\nThe costly treasures of art and virtu, as well as the furniture of the\r\nrich mansion, were scattered far and wide; and one of its tables served\r\nthe writer of this memoir to scribble upon, when first stern necessity,\r\nor yet sterner ambition, urged him to add his mite to the Babel tower of\r\nliterature.  At that table I first read “Vathek.”  I have read it often\r\nsince, and every perusal has increased my admiration.\r\n\r\nNearly fifty years after the publication of “Vathek,” in 1835, Mr.\r\nBeckford published his “Recollections of an Excursion to the Monasteries\r\nof Alcobaca and Batalha,” which he had taken in 1795, together with an\r\nepistolatory record of his observations in Italy, Spain and Portugal,\r\nbetween the years 1780 and 1794.  These are marked, as he himself\r\nintimates, “with the bloom and heyday of youthful spirits and youthful\r\nconfidence, at a period when the older order of things existed with all\r\nits picturesque pomps and absurdities; when Venice enjoyed her Piombi and\r\nsub-marine dungeons; Prance her Bastille; the Peninsula her Holy\r\nInquisition.”  With none of those subjects, however, are the letters\r\noccupied—but with delineations of landscape, and the effects of natural\r\nphenomena.  These literary efforts appear to have exhausted their\r\nauthor’s productive powers; in a word, he seems soon to have been\r\n“used-up,” and then to have discontinued his search after new sensations,\r\nor to have been content to live without them.\r\n\r\nAfter the sale of Fonthill, our author lived a considerable time in\r\nPortugal, and hence Lord Byron, who was fond of casting the shadow of his\r\nown imagination over every object, penned the well-known lines at Cintra:\r\n\r\n    “There thou, too, Vathek, England’s wealthiest son,\r\n       Once formed thy paradise; as not aware\r\n       Where wanton wealth her mightiest deeds hath done,\r\n    Meek peace, voluptuous lures, was ever wont to shun.\r\n\r\n       Here didst thou dwell; here scenes of pleasure plan,\r\n       Beneath yon mountain’s ever beauteous brow;\r\n       But now, as if a thing unblest by man,\r\n       Thy fairy dwelling is as lone as thou!\r\n       Here giant weeds a passage scarce allow\r\n       To halls deserted; portals gaping wide\r\n       Fresh lessons to the thinking bosom; how\r\n       Vain are the pleasaunces on earth supplied,\r\n    Swept into wrecks anon by time’s ungentle tide.”\r\n\r\nThese sombre verses contrast strangely with Beckford’s saying to Mr.\r\nCyrus Redding, in his seventy-sixth year, “that he had never felt a\r\nmoments’ ennui in his life.”\r\n\r\nBeckford was in person scarcely above the middle height, slender, and\r\nwell formed, with features indicating great intellectual power.  He was\r\nexactly one year younger than Pitt, the companion of his minority.  His\r\npolitical principles were popular, though it is recorded, that at a court\r\nball on the Queen’s birth-day, in 1782, he, with Miss North, led up a\r\ncountry dance.  He sat in parliament, in his early years, both for Wells\r\nand Hendon, but retired on account of bad health.  This, however, he\r\novercame by careful diet and exercise, as testified by his great bodily\r\nactivity almost to the last.  He was a man of most extensive reading, and\r\ncultivated taste.\r\n\r\nThe last years of his life were passed at Bath—where he united two houses\r\nin Lansdown Crescent, by an arch thrown across the street, and containing\r\nhis library, which was well selected, and very extensive.  Not far off,\r\nhe again erected a tower, 180 feet high, of which the following\r\ndescription was given at the time of his decease, by a correspondent of\r\nthe Athenæum:—\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beckford, at an early period of his residence there, erected a lofty\r\ntower, in the apartments of which were placed many of his choicest\r\npaintings and articles of virtu.  Asiatic in its style, with gilded\r\nlattices and blinds, or curtains, of crimson cloth, its striped ceilings,\r\nits minaret, and other accessories, conveyed the idea that the being who\r\ndesigned the place and endeavoured to carry out the plan, was deeply\r\nimbued with the spirit of that lonely grandeur and strict solitariness\r\nwhich obtains through all countries and among all people of the East.\r\nThe building was surrounded by a high wall, and entrance afforded to the\r\ngarden in which the tower stood, by a door of small dimensions.  The\r\ngarden itself was Eastern in its character.  Though comparatively\r\ncircumscribed in its size, nevertheless were to be found within it,\r\nsolitary walks and deep retiring shades, such as could be supposed\r\nVathek, the mournful and the magnificent, loved, and from the bowers of\r\nwhich might be expected would suddenly fall upon the ear, sounds of the\r\ncymbal and the dulcimer.  The building contained several apartments\r\ncrowded with the finest paintings.  At the time I made my inspection the\r\nwalls were crowded with the choicest productions of the easel.  The\r\nmemory falls back upon ineffaceable impressions of Old Franks, Breughel,\r\nCuyp, Titian, (a Holy Family), Hondekooter, Polemberg, and a host of\r\nother painters whose works have immortalized Art.  Ornaments of the most\r\nexquisite gold fillagree, carvings in ivory and wood, Raphaelesque china,\r\ngoblets formed of gems, others fashioned by the miraculous hands of\r\nBenvenuto Cellini, filled the many cabinets and _recherché_ receptacles\r\ncreated for such things.  The doors of the rooms were of finely polished\r\nwood—the windows of single sweeps of plate glass—the cornices of gilded\r\nsilver; every part, both within and without, bespeaking the wealth, the\r\nmagnificence, and the taste of him who had built this temple in\r\ndedication to grandeur, solitariness, and the arts.”\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of this tower, Mr. Beckford, and he alone without a\r\ntelescope,—could behold that other tower of his youthful magnificence,\r\nFonthill; on which he loved to gaze, with feelings which it would be\r\ndifficult to describe.  His eyesight was wonderful; he could gaze upon\r\nthe sun like an eagle; and on the day that the great tower at Fonthill\r\nfell he missed it in the landscape long before the news of the\r\ncatastrophe reached Bath.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we have only to add, that our author, in his life-time,\r\nhad all that wealth can give, and in his grave his memory will retain\r\nthat which no wealth can purchase.  Whatever may have been his errors,\r\nthey have died with him.  His genius yet lives, and “Vathek,” now for the\r\nfirst time presented to the public in a popular form, will, whilst\r\nEnglish literature lasts, never want readers, and, while good taste\r\nflourishes, admirers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE original of the following story, with some others of a similar kind,\r\ncollected in the east by a man of letters, was communicated to the editor\r\nabove three years ago.  The pleasure he received from the perusal of it\r\ninduced him at that time to transcribe, and since to translate it.  How\r\nfar the copy may be a just representation it becomes not him to\r\ndetermine.  He presumes however to hope that if the difficulty of\r\naccommodating our English idioms to the Arabic, preserving the\r\ncorrespondent tones of a diversified narration, and discriminating the\r\nnicer touches of character through the shades of foreign manners be duly\r\nconsidered, a failure in some points will not preclude him from all claim\r\nto indulgence; especially if those images, sentiments, and passions,\r\nwhich being independent of local peculiarities, may be expressed in every\r\nlanguage, shall be found to retain their native energy in our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVATHEK.\r\n\r\n\r\nVATHEK, ninth Caliph {7a} of the race of the Abassides, was the son of\r\nMotassem, and the grandson of Haroun Al Raschid.  From an early accession\r\nto the throne, and the talents he possessed to adorn it, his subjects\r\nwere induced to expect that his reign would be long and happy.  His\r\nfigure was pleasing and majestic; but when he was angry, one of his eyes\r\nbecame so terrible {7b} that no person could bear to behold it; and the\r\nwretch upon whom it was fixed instantly fell backward, and sometimes\r\nexpired.  For fear, however, of depopulating his dominions, and making\r\nhis palace desolate, he but rarely gave way to his anger.\r\n\r\nBeing much addicted to women, and the pleasures of the table, he sought\r\nby his affability to procure agreeable companions; and he succeeded the\r\nbetter, as his generosity was unbounded and his indulgences unrestrained;\r\nfor he was by no means scrupulous: nor did he think, with the Caliph Omar\r\nBen Abdalaziz, {8a} that it was necessary to make a hell of this world to\r\nenjoy Paradise in the next.\r\n\r\nHe surpassed in magnificence all his predecessors.  The palace of\r\nAlkoremmi, which his father Motassem had erected on the hill of Pied\r\nHorses, and which commanded the whole city of Samarah, {8b} was in his\r\nidea far too scanty: he added, therefore, five wings, or rather other\r\npalaces, which he destined for the particular gratification of each of\r\nhis senses.\r\n\r\nIn the first of these were tables continually covered with the most\r\nexquisite dainties, which were supplied both by night and by day\r\naccording to their constant consumption; whilst the most delicious wines,\r\nand the choicest cordials, flowed forth from a hundred fountains, that\r\nwere never exhausted.  This palace was called “The Eternal, or\r\nUnsatiating Banquet.”\r\n\r\nThe second was styled “The Temple of Melody, or the Nectar of the Soul.”\r\nIt was inhabited by the most skilful musicians and admired poets of the\r\ntime, who not only displayed their talents within, but dispersing in\r\nbands without, caused every surrounding scene to reverberate their songs,\r\nwhich were continually varied in the most delightful succession.\r\n\r\nThe palace named “The Delight of the Eyes, or the Support of Memory,” was\r\none entire enchantment.  Rarities collected from every corner of the\r\nearth were there found in such profusion as to dazzle and confound, but\r\nfor the order in which they were arranged.  One gallery exhibited the\r\npictures of the celebrated Mani; and statues that seemed to be alive.\r\nHere a well-managed perspective attracted the sight; there, the magic of\r\noptics agreeably deceived it; whilst the naturalist, on his part,\r\nexhibited in their several classes the various gifts that heaven had\r\nbestowed on our globe.  In a word, Vathek omitted nothing in this\r\nparticular that might gratify the curiosity of those who resorted to it,\r\nalthough he was not able to satisfy his own; for he was, of all men, the\r\nmost curious.\r\n\r\n“The Palace of Perfumes,” which was termed likewise, “The Incentive to\r\nPleasure,” consisted of various halls, where the different perfumes which\r\nthe earth produces were kept perpetually burning in censers of gold.\r\nFlambeaus and aromatic lamps were here lighted in open day; but the too\r\npowerful effects of this agreeable delirium might be avoided by\r\ndescending into an immense garden, where an assemblage of every fragrant\r\nflower diffused through the air the purest odours.\r\n\r\nThe fifth palace, denominated “The Retreat of Joy, or the Dangerous,” was\r\nfrequented by troops of young females, beautiful as the Houris, {9} and\r\nnot less seducing, who never failed to receive with caresses all whom the\r\nCaliph allowed to approach them; for he was by no means disposed to be\r\njealous, as his own women were secluded within the palace he inhabited\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the sensuality in which Vathek indulged, he experienced\r\nno abatement in the love of his people, who thought that a sovereign\r\nimmersed in pleasure was not less tolerable to his subjects than one that\r\nemployed himself in creating them foes.  But the unquiet and impetuous\r\ndisposition of the Caliph would not allow him to rest there: he had\r\nstudied so much for his amusement in the life-time of his father as to\r\nacquire a great deal of knowledge, though not a sufficiency to satisfy\r\nhimself; for he wished to know everything; even sciences that did not\r\nexist.  He was fond of engaging in disputes with the learned, but liked\r\nthem not to push their opposition with warmth.  He stopped the mouths of\r\nthose with presents, whose mouths could be stopped; whilst others, whom\r\nhis liberality was unable to subdue, he sent to prison to cool their\r\nblood; a remedy that often succeeded.\r\n\r\nVathek discovered also a predilection for theological controversy; but it\r\nwas not with the orthodox that he usually held.  By this means he induced\r\nthe zealots to oppose him, and then persecuted them in return; for he\r\nresolved, at any rate, to have reason on his side.\r\n\r\nThe great prophet Mahomet, whose vicars the Caliphs are, beheld with\r\nindignation from his abode in the seventh heaven the irreligious conduct\r\nof such a vicegerent.\r\n\r\n“Let us leave him to himself,” said he to the Genii, {10} who are always\r\nready to receive his commands; “let us see to what lengths his folly and\r\nimpiety will carry him; if he run into excess we shall know how to\r\nchastise him.  Assist him, therefore, to complete the tower which, in\r\nimitation of Nimrod, he hath begun; not, like that great warrior, to\r\nescape being drowned, but from the insolent curiosity of penetrating the\r\nsecrets of heaven: he will not divine the fate that awaits him.”\r\n\r\nThe Genii obeyed; and when the workmen had raised their structure a cubit\r\nin the day time, two cubits more were added in the night.  The expedition\r\nwith which the fabric arose was not a little flattering to the vanity of\r\nVathek.  He fancied that even insensible matter showed forwardness to\r\nsubserve his designs; not considering that the successes of the foolish\r\nand wicked form the first rod of their chastisement.\r\n\r\nHis pride arrived at its height when, having ascended, for the first\r\ntime, the eleven thousand stairs of his tower, he cast his eyes below and\r\nbeheld men not larger than pismires; mountains than shells; and cities\r\nthan bee-hives.  The idea which such an elevation inspired of his own\r\ngrandeur completely bewildered him; he was almost ready to adore himself;\r\ntill lifting his eyes upwards, he saw the stars as high above him as they\r\nappeared when he stood on the surface of the earth.  He consoled himself,\r\nhowever, for this transient perception of his littleness with the thought\r\nof being great in the eyes of the others, and flattered himself that the\r\nlight of his mind would extend beyond the reach of his sight, and\r\ntransfer to the stars the decrees of his destiny.\r\n\r\nWith this view the inquisitive prince passed most of his nights on the\r\nsummit of his tower, till he became an adept in the mysteries of\r\nastrology, and imagined that the planets had disclosed to him the most\r\nmarvellous adventures, which were to be accomplished by an extraordinary\r\npersonage, from a country altogether unknown.  Prompted by motives of\r\ncuriosity, he had always been courteous to strangers; but from this\r\ninstant he redoubled his attention, and ordered it to be announced by\r\nsound of trumpet, through all the streets of Samarah, that no one of his\r\nsubjects, on peril of his displeasure, should either lodge or detain a\r\ntraveller, but forthwith bring him to the palace.\r\n\r\nNot long after this proclamation, there arrived in his metropolis, a man\r\nso hideous that the very guards who arrested him were forced to shut\r\ntheir eyes as they led him along.  The Caliph himself appeared startled\r\nat so horrible a visage; but joy succeeded to this emotion of terror when\r\nthe stranger displayed to his view such rarities as he had never before\r\nseen, and of which he had no conception.\r\n\r\nIn reality, nothing was ever so extraordinary as the merchandise this\r\nstranger produced.  Most of his curiosities, which were not less\r\nadmirable for their workmanship than their splendour, had besides, their\r\nseveral virtues described on a parchment fastened to each.  There were\r\nslippers which enabled the feet to walk; knives that cut without the\r\nmotion of a hand; sabres which dealt the blow at the person they were\r\nwished to strike; and the whole enriched with gems that were hitherto\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThe sabres, whose blades emitted a dazzling radiance, fixed more than all\r\nthe Caliph’s attention, who promised himself to decipher at his leisure\r\nthe uncouth characters engraven on their sides.  Without, therefore,\r\ndemanding their price, he ordered all the coined gold to be brought from\r\nhis treasury, and commanded the merchant to take what he pleased.  The\r\nstranger complied with modesty and silence.\r\n\r\nVathek, imagining that the merchant’s taciturnity was occasioned by the\r\nawe which his presence inspired, encouraged him to advance, and asked\r\nhim, with an air of condescension, “Who he was? whence he came? and where\r\nhe obtained such beautiful commodities?”\r\n\r\nThe man, or rather monster, instead of making a reply, thrice rubbed his\r\nforehead, which, as well as his body, was blacker than ebony; four times\r\nclapped his paunch, the projection of which was enormous; opened wide his\r\nhuge eyes, which glowed like firebrands; began to laugh with a hideous\r\nnoise, and discovered his long amber coloured teeth bestreaked with\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph, though a little startled, renewed his enquiries, but without\r\nbeing able to procure a reply.  At which, beginning to be ruffled, he\r\nexclaimed, “knowest thou, varlet, who I am? and at whom thou art aiming\r\nthy gibes?”  Then addressing his guards, “have ye heard him speak? is he\r\ndumb?”\r\n\r\n“He hath spoken,” they replied, “though but little.”\r\n\r\n“Let him speak then again,” said Vathek, “and tell me who he is, from\r\nwhence he came, and where he procured these singular curiosities, or I\r\nswear, by the ass of Balaam, that I will make him rue his pertinacity.”\r\n\r\nThis menace was accompanied by the Caliph with one of his angry and\r\nperilous glances, which the stranger sustained without the slightest\r\nemotion, although his eyes were fixed on the terrible eye of the prince.\r\n\r\nNo words can describe the amazement of the courtiers, when they beheld\r\nthis rude merchant withstand the encounter unshocked.  They all fell\r\nprostrate with their faces on the ground, to avoid the risk of their\r\nlives, and continued in the same abject posture till the Caliph exclaimed\r\nin a furious tone:\r\n\r\n“Up, cowards! seize the miscreant! see that he be committed to prison,\r\nand guarded by the best of my soldiers!  Let him, however, retain the\r\nmoney I gave him; it is not my intent to take from him his property, I\r\nonly want him to speak.”\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he uttered these words than the stranger was surrounded,\r\npinioned with strong fetters, and hurried away to the prison of the great\r\ntower, which was encompassed by seven empalements of iron bars, and armed\r\nwith spikes in every direction, longer and sharper than spits.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph, nevertheless, remained in the most violent agitation.  He sat\r\ndown indeed to eat, but of the three hundred covers that were daily\r\nplaced before him, could taste of no more than thirty-two.\r\n\r\nA diet to which he had been so little accustomed, was sufficient of\r\nitself to prevent him from sleeping, what then must be its effect when\r\njoined to the anxiety that prayed upon his spirits?  At the first glimpse\r\nof dawn he hastened to the prison, again to importune this intractable\r\nstranger; but the rage of Vathek exceeded all bounds on finding the\r\nprison empty, the gates burst asunder, and his guards lying lifeless\r\naround him.  In the paroxysm of his passion he fell furiously on the poor\r\ncarcases, and kicked them till evening without intermission.  His\r\ncourtiers and viziers exerted their efforts to soothe his extravagance,\r\nbut finding every expedient ineffectual, they all united in one\r\nvociferation:\r\n\r\n“The Caliph is gone mad! the Caliph is out of his senses!”\r\n\r\nThis outcry, which was soon resounded through the streets of Samarah, at\r\nlength reached the ears of Carathis, his mother: she flew in the utmost\r\nconsternation to try her ascendency on the mind of her son.  Her tears\r\nand caresses called off his attention; and he was prevailed upon by her\r\nentreaties to be brought back to the palace.\r\n\r\nCarathis, apprehensive of leaving Vathek to himself, caused him to be put\r\nto bed; and seating herself by him, endeavoured by her conversation to\r\nheal and compose him.  Nor could any one have attempted it with better\r\nsuccess; for the Caliph not only loved her as a mother but respected her\r\nas a person of superior genius.  It was she who had induced him, being a\r\nGreek herself, to adopt all the sciences and systems of her country,\r\nwhich good Mussulmans hold in such thorough abhorrence.\r\n\r\nJudicial astrology was one of those systems in which Carathis was a\r\nperfect adept.  She began, therefore, with reminding her son of the\r\npromise which the stars had made him; and intimated an intention of\r\nconsulting them again.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” sighed the Caliph, as soon at he could speak, “what a fool have I\r\nbeen! not for the kicks bestowed on my guards, who so tamely submitted to\r\ndeath, but for never considering that this extraordinary man was the same\r\nthe planets had foretold; whom, instead of ill-treating, I should have\r\nconciliated by all the arts of persuasion.”\r\n\r\n“The past,” said Carathis, “cannot be recalled; but it behoves us to\r\nthink of the future: perhaps you may again see the object you so much\r\nregret: it is possible the inscriptions on the sabres will afford\r\ninformation.  Eat, therefore, and take thy repose, my dear son.  We will\r\nconsider, to-morrow, in what manner to act.”\r\n\r\nVathek yielded to her counsel as well as he could, and arose in the\r\nmorning with a mind more at ease.  The sabres he commanded to be\r\ninstantly brought; and poring upon them through a green glass, that their\r\nglittering might not dazzle, he set himself in earnest to decipher the\r\ninscriptions; but his reiterated attempts were all of them nugatory: in\r\nvain did he beat his head and bite his nails; not a letter of the whole\r\nwas he able to ascertain.  So unlucky a disappointment would have undone\r\nhim again, had not Carathis, by good fortune, entered the apartment.\r\n\r\n“Have patience, son!” said she.  “You certainly are possessed of every\r\nimportant science, but the knowledge of languages is a trifle, at best;\r\nand the accomplishment of none but a pedant.  Issue forth a proclamation\r\nthat you will confer such rewards as become your greatness upon any one\r\nthat shall interpret what you do not understand, and what it is beneath\r\nyou to learn.  You will soon find your curiosity gratified.”\r\n\r\n“That may be,” said the Caliph; “but in the mean time I shall be horribly\r\ndisgusted by a crowd of smatterers, who will come to the trial as much\r\nfor the pleasure of retailing their jargon as from the hope of gaining\r\nthe reward.  To avoid this evil, it will be proper to add that I will put\r\nevery candidate to death who shall fail to give satisfaction; for, thank\r\nheaven, I have skill enough to distinguish between one that translates\r\nand one that invents.”\r\n\r\n“Of that I have no doubt,” replied Carathis, “but to put the ignorant to\r\ndeath is somewhat severe, and may be productive of dangerous effects.\r\nContent yourself with commanding their beards to be burnt: beards, in a\r\nstate, are not quite so essential as men.”\r\n\r\nThe Caliph submitted to the reasons of his mother, and sending for\r\nMorakanabad, his prime vizier, said:\r\n\r\n“Let the common criers proclaim, not only in Samarah, but throughout\r\nevery city in my empire, that whosoever will repair hither, and decipher\r\ncertain characters which appear to be inexplicable, shall experience the\r\nliberality for which I am renowned; but that all who fail upon trial\r\nshall have their beards burnt off to the last hair.  Let them add also,\r\nthat I will bestow fifty beautiful slaves, and as many jars of apricots\r\nfrom the isle of Kirmith, upon any man that shall bring me intelligence\r\nof the stranger.”\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the Caliph, like their sovereign, being great admirers of\r\nwomen, and apricots from Kirmith, felt their mouths water at these\r\npromises, but were totally unable to gratify their hankering, for no one\r\nknew which way the stranger had gone.\r\n\r\nAs to the Caliph’s other requisition the result was different: the\r\nlearned, the half-learned, and those who were neither, but fancied\r\nthemselves equal to both, came boldly to hazard their beards, and all\r\nshamefully lost them.\r\n\r\nThe exaction of these forfeitures, which found sufficient employment for\r\nthe Eunuchs, gave them such a smell of singed hair as greatly to disgust\r\nthe ladies of the seraglio, and make it necessary that this new\r\noccupation of their guardians should be transferred into other hands.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, an old man presented himself, whose beard was a\r\ncubit-and-a-half longer than any that had appeared before him.  The\r\nofficers of the palace whispered to each other, as they ushered him in:\r\n\r\n“What a pity such a beard should be burnt!”\r\n\r\nEven the Caliph, when he saw it, concurred with them in opinion; but his\r\nconcern was entirely needless.  This venerable personage read the\r\ncharacters with facility, and explained them verbatim, as follows:\r\n\r\n“We were made where everything good is made; we are the least of the\r\nwonders of a place where all is wonderful; and deserving the sight of the\r\nfirst potentate on earth.”\r\n\r\n“You translate admirably!” cried Vathek.  “I know to what these\r\nmarvellous characters allude.  Let him receive as many robes of honour,\r\nand thousands of sequins of gold, as he hath spoken words.  I am in some\r\nmeasure relieved from the perplexity that embarrassed me!”\r\n\r\nVathek invited the old man to dine, and even to remain some days in the\r\npalace.  Unluckily for him, he accepted the offer; for the Caliph having\r\nordered him next morning to be called, said:\r\n\r\n“Read again to me what you have read already; I cannot hear too often the\r\npromise that is made me, the completion of which I languish to obtain.”\r\n\r\nThe old man forthwith put on his green spectacles; but they instantly\r\ndropped from his nose, on perceiving that the characters he had read the\r\nday preceding, had given place to others of different import.\r\n\r\n“What ails you?” asked the Caliph; “and why these symptoms of wonder?”\r\n\r\n“Sovereign of the world,” replied the old man, “these sabres hold another\r\nlanguage to-day, from that they yesterday held.”\r\n\r\n“How say you?” returned Vathek.  “But it matters not! tell me, if you\r\ncan, what they mean.”\r\n\r\n“It is this, my lord,” rejoined the old man: “‘Woe to the rash mortal who\r\nseeks to know that of which he should remain ignorant and to undertake\r\nthat which surpasseth his power!’”\r\n\r\n“And woe to thee!” cried the Caliph, in a burst of indignation: “to-day\r\nthou art void of understanding: begone from my presence, they shall burn\r\nbut the half of thy beard, because thou wert yesterday fortunate in\r\nguessing.  My gifts I never resume.”\r\n\r\nThe old man, wise enough to perceive he had luckily escaped, considering\r\nthe folly of disclosing so disgusting a truth, immediately withdrew, and\r\nappeared not again.\r\n\r\nBut it was not long before Vathek discovered abundant reason to regret\r\nhis precipitation; for though he could not decipher the characters\r\nhimself, yet, by constantly poring upon them, he plainly perceived that\r\nthey every day changed; and unfortunately no other candidate offered to\r\nexplain them.  This perplexing occupation inflamed his blood, dazzled his\r\nsight, and brought on a giddiness and debility that he could not support.\r\nHe failed not, however, though in so reduced a condition, to be often\r\ncarried to his tower, as he flattered himself that he might there read in\r\nthe stars, which he went to consult, something more congruous to his\r\nwishes.  But in this his hopes were deluded; for his eyes, dimmed by the\r\nvapours of his head, began to subserve his curiosity so ill, that he\r\nbeheld nothing but a thick dun cloud, which he took for the most direful\r\nof omens.\r\n\r\nAgitated with so much anxiety, Vathek entirely lost all firmness; a fever\r\nseized him and his appetite failed.  Instead of being one of the greatest\r\neaters, he became as distinguished for drinking.  So insatiable was the\r\nthirst which tormented him, that his mouth, like a funnel, was always\r\nopen to receive the various liquors that might be poured into it and\r\nespecially cold water, which calmed him more than every other.\r\n\r\nThis unhappy prince being thus incapacitated for the enjoyment of any\r\npleasure, commanded the palaces of the five senses to be shut up;\r\nforebore to appear in public, either to display his magnificence or\r\nadminister justice; and retired to the inmost apartment of his harem.  As\r\nhe had ever been an indulgent husband, his wives, overwhelmed with grief\r\nat his deplorable situation, incessantly offered their prayers for his\r\nhealth, and unremittingly supplied him with water.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the Princess Carathis, whose affliction no words can\r\ndescribe, instead of restraining herself to sobbing and tears, was\r\ncloseted daily with the Vizier Morakanabad, to find out some cure or\r\nmitigation of the Caliph’s disease.  Under the persuasion that it was\r\ncaused by enchantment, they turned over together leaf by leaf, all the\r\nbooks of magic that might point out a remedy; and caused the horrible\r\nstranger, whom they accused as the enchanter, to be everywhere sought for\r\nwith the strictest diligence.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of a few miles from Samarah stood a high mountain, whose\r\nsides were swarded with wild thyme and basil, and its summit overspread\r\nwith so delightful a plain that it might be taken for the Paradise\r\ndestined for the faithful.  Upon it grew a hundred thickets of eglantine\r\nand other fragrant shrubs; a hundred arbours of roses, jessamine, and\r\nhoneysuckle; as many clumps of orange trees, cedar, and citron; whose\r\nbranches, interwoven with the palm, the pomegranate, and the vine,\r\npresented every luxury that could regale the eye or the taste.  The\r\nground was strewed with violets, harebells, and pansies; in the midst of\r\nwhich sprung forth tufts of jonquils, hyacinths, and carnations, with\r\nevery other perfume that impregnates the air.  Four fountains, not less\r\nclear than deep, and so abundant as to slake the thirst of ten armies,\r\nseemed purposely placed here to make the scene more resemble the garden\r\nof Eden, which was watered by the four sacred rivers.  Here the\r\nnightingale sang the birth of the rose, her well-beloved, and at the same\r\ntime lamented its short-lived beauty; whilst the turtle deplored the loss\r\nof more substantial pleasures and the wakeful lark hailed the rising\r\nlight that reanimates the whole creation.  Here, more than anywhere, the\r\nmingled melodies of birds expressed the various passions they inspired;\r\nas if the exquisite fruits, which they pecked at pleasure, had given them\r\na double energy.\r\n\r\nTo this mountain Vathek was sometimes brought, for the sake of breathing\r\na purer air; and especially, to drink at will of the four fountains,\r\nwhich were reputed in the highest degree salubrious, and sacred to\r\nhimself.  His attendants were his mother, his wives, and some eunuchs,\r\nwho assiduously employed themselves in filling capacious bowls of rock\r\ncrystal, and emulously presenting them to him.  But it frequently\r\nhappened that his avidity exceeded their zeal; insomuch that he would\r\nprostrate himself upon the ground to lap up the water, of which he could\r\nnever have enough.\r\n\r\nOne day when this unhappy prince had been long lying in so debasing a\r\nposture, a voice, hoarse but strong, thus addressed him:\r\n\r\n“Why assumest thou the function of a dog, oh Caliph, so proud of thy\r\ndignity and power?”\r\n\r\nAt this apostrophe he raised up his head and beheld the stranger that had\r\ncaused him so much affliction.  Inflamed with anger at the sight, he\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Accursed Giaour! {23} what comest thou hither to do? is it not enough to\r\nhave transformed a prince, remarkable for his agility, into one of those\r\nleather barrels which the Bedouin Arabs carry on their camels when they\r\ntraverse the deserts?  Perceivest thou not that I may perish by drinking\r\nto excess, no less than by a total abstinence?”\r\n\r\n“Drink then this draught,” said the stranger, as he presented to him a\r\nphial of a red and yellow mixture; “and to satiate the thirst of thy soul\r\nas well as of thy body, know that I am an Indian, but from a region of\r\nIndia which is wholly unknown.”\r\n\r\nThe Caliph, delighted to see his desires accomplished in part, and\r\nflattering himself with the hope of obtaining their entire fulfilment,\r\nwithout a moment’s hesitation swallowed the potion, and instantaneously\r\nfound his health restored, his thirst appeased, and his limbs as agile as\r\never.\r\n\r\nIn the transports of his joy, Vathek leaped upon the neck of the\r\nfrightful Indian, and kissed his horrid mouth and hollow cheeks, as\r\nthough they had been the coral lips, and the lilies and roses of his most\r\nbeautiful wives; whilst they, less terrified than jealous at the sight,\r\ndropped their veils to hide the blush of mortification that suffused\r\ntheir foreheads.\r\n\r\nNor would the scene have closed here, had not Carathis, with all the art\r\nof insinuation, a little repressed the raptures of her son.  Having\r\nprevailed upon him to return to Samarah, she caused a herald to precede\r\nhim, whom she commanded to proclaim as loudly as possible:\r\n\r\n“The wonderful stranger hath appeared again; he hath healed the Caliph;\r\nhe hath spoken! he hath spoken!”\r\n\r\nForthwith all the inhabitants of this vast city quitted their\r\nhabitations, and ran together in crowds to see the procession of Vathek\r\nand the Indian, whom they now blessed as much as they had before\r\nexecrated, incessantly shouting,\r\n\r\n“He hath healed our sovereign; he hath spoken! he hath spoken!”\r\n\r\nNor were these words forgotten in the public festivals, which were\r\ncelebrated the same evening to testify the general joy, for the poets\r\napplied them as a chorus to all the songs they composed.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph, in the mean while caused the palaces of the senses to be\r\nagain set open, and as he found himself prompted to visit that of taste,\r\nin preference to the rest, immediately ordered a splendid entertainment,\r\nto which his great officers and favourite courtiers were all invited.\r\nThe Indian, who was placed near the prince, seemed to think that as a\r\nproper acknowledgment of so distinguished a privilege, he could neither\r\neat, drink, nor talk too much.  The various dainties were no sooner\r\nserved up than they vanished, to the great mortification of Vathek, who\r\npiqued himself on being the greatest eater alive, and at this time in\r\nparticular had an excellent appetite.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the company looked round at each other in amazement, but the\r\nIndian without appearing to observe it, quaffed large bumpers to the\r\nhealth of each of them: sung in a style altogether extravagant; related\r\nstories at which he laughed immoderately; and poured forth extemporaneous\r\nverses which would not have been thought bad, but for the strange\r\ngrimaces with which they were uttered.  In a word, his loquacity was\r\nequal to that of a hundred astrologers; he ate as much as a hundred\r\nporters, and caroused in proportion.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph, notwithstanding the table had been thirty times covered,\r\nfound himself incommoded by the voraciousness of his guest, who was now\r\nconsiderably declined in the prince’s esteem.  Vathek, however, being\r\nunwilling to betray the chagrin he could hardly disguise, said in a\r\nwhisper to Bababalouk, {26a} the chief of his eunuchs:\r\n\r\n“You see how enormous his performances in every way are; what would be\r\nthe consequence should he get at my wives?  Go! redouble your vigilance,\r\nand be sure look well to my Circassians, who would be more to his taste\r\nthan all of the rest.”\r\n\r\nThe bird of the morning had thrice renewed his song, when the hour of the\r\ndivan {26b} sounded.  Vathek, in gratitude to his subjects, having\r\npromised to attend, immediately arose from table and repaired thither\r\nleaning upon his vizier, who could scarcely support him, so disordered\r\nwas the poor prince by the wine he had drank, and still more by the\r\nextravagant vagaries of his boisterous guest.\r\n\r\nThe viziers, the officers of the crown, and of the law, arranged\r\nthemselves in a semi-circle about their sovereign, and preserved a\r\nrespectful silence, whilst the Indian, who looked as cool as if come from\r\na fast, sat down without ceremony on a step of the throne, laughing in\r\nhis sleeve at the indignation with which his temerity had filled the\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph, however, whose ideas were confused and his head embarrassed,\r\nwent on administering justice at hap-hazard, till at length the prime\r\nvizier {27} perceiving his situation, hit upon a sudden expedient to\r\ninterrupt the audience, and rescue the honour of his master, to whom he\r\nsaid in a whisper:\r\n\r\n“My lord, the princess Carathis, who hath passed the night in consulting\r\nthe planets, informs you that they portend you evil; and the danger is\r\nurgent.  Beware, lest this stranger whom you have so lavishly recompensed\r\nfor his magical gewgaws, should make some attempt on your life: his\r\nliquor, which at first had the appearance of effecting your cure, may be\r\nno more than a poison of a sudden operation.  Slight not this surmise;\r\nask him, at least, of what it was compounded; whence he procured it; and\r\nmention the sabres, which you seem to have forgotten.”\r\n\r\nVathek, to whom the insolent airs of the stranger became every moment\r\nless supportable, intimated to his vizier by a wink of acquiescence, that\r\nhe would adopt his advice, and at once turning towards the Indian, said:\r\n\r\n“Get up and declare in full divan of what drugs the liquor was compounded\r\nyou enjoined me to take, for it is suspected to be poison; add also the\r\nexplanation I have so earnestly desired concerning the sabres you sold\r\nme, and thus show your gratitude for the favours heaped on you.”\r\n\r\nHaving pronounced these words in as moderate a tone as a Caliph well\r\ncould, he waited in silent expectation for an answer; but the Indian,\r\nstill keeping his seat, began to renew his loud shouts of laughter, and\r\nexhibit the same horrid grimaces he had shown them before, without\r\nvouchsafing a word in reply.  Vathek, no longer able to brook such\r\ninsolence, immediately kicked him from the steps, instantly descending\r\nrepeated his blow, and persisted with such assiduity, as incited all who\r\nwere present to follow his example.  Every foot was aimed at the Indian,\r\nand no sooner had any one given him a kick than he felt himself\r\nconstrained to reiterate the stroke.\r\n\r\nThe stranger afforded them no small entertainment; for being both short\r\nand plump, he collected himself into a ball and rolled round on all sides\r\nat the blows of his assailants, who pressed after him wherever he turned,\r\nwith an eagerness beyond conception, whilst their numbers were every\r\nmoment increasing.  The ball, indeed, in passing from one apartment to\r\nanother, drew every person after it that came in its way, insomuch that\r\nthe whole palace was thrown into confusion, and resounded with a\r\ntremendous clamour.  The women of the harem, amazed at the uproar, flew\r\nto their blinds to discover the cause, but no sooner did they catch a\r\nglimpse of the ball than feeling themselves unable to refrain, they broke\r\nfrom the clutches of their eunuchs, who to stop their flight pinched them\r\ntill they bled, but in vain; whilst themselves, though trembling with\r\nterror at the escape of their charge, were as incapable of resisting the\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\nThe Indian, after having traversed the halls, galleries, chambers,\r\nkitchens, gardens, and stables of the palace, at last took his course\r\nthrough the courts, whilst the Caliph, pursuing him closer than the rest,\r\nbestowed as many kicks as he possibly could, yet not without receiving\r\nnow and then one, which his competitors, in their eagerness, designed for\r\nthe ball.\r\n\r\nCarathis, Morakanabad, and two or three old viziers whose wisdom had\r\nhitherto withstood the attraction, wishing to prevent Vathek from\r\nexposing himself in the presence of his subjects, fell down in his way to\r\nimpede the pursuit, but he, regardless of their obstruction, leaped over\r\ntheir heads, and went on as before.  They then ordered the muezzins to\r\ncall the people to prayers, both for the sake of getting them out of the\r\nway, and of endeavouring by their petitions to avert the calamity; but\r\nneither of these expedients was a whit more successful.  The sight of\r\nthis fatal ball was alone sufficient to draw after it every beholder.\r\nThe muezzins themselves, though they saw it but at a distance, hastened\r\ndown from their minarets and mixed with the crowd, which continued to\r\nincrease in so surprising a manner, that scarce an inhabitant was left in\r\nSamarah, except the aged, the sick confined to their beds, and infants at\r\nthe breast, whose nurses could run more nimbly without them.  Even\r\nCarathis, Morakanabad, and the rest, were all become of the party.\r\n\r\nThe shrill screams of the females who had broken from their apartments,\r\nand were unable to extricate themselves from the pressure of the crowd,\r\ntogether with those of the eunuchs jostling after them, terrified lest\r\ntheir charge should escape from their sight, increased by the execrations\r\nof husbands urging forward and menacing both, kicks given and received,\r\nstumblings and overthrows at every step, in a word, the confusion that\r\nuniversally prevailed, rendered Samarah like a city taken by storm, and\r\ndevoted to absolute plunder.\r\n\r\nAt last the cursed Indian, who still preserved his rotundity of figure,\r\nafter passing through all the streets and public places, and leaving them\r\nempty, rolled onwards to the plain of Catoul, and traversed the valley at\r\nthe foot of the mountain of the four fountains.\r\n\r\nAs a continual fall of water had excavated an immense gulph in the\r\nvalley, whose opposite side was closed in by a steep acclivity, the\r\nCaliph and his attendants were apprehensive lest the ball should bound\r\ninto the chasm, and to prevent it, redoubled their efforts, but in vain.\r\nThe Indian persevered in his onward direction, and as had been\r\napprehended, glancing from the precipice with the rapidity of lightning,\r\nwas lost in the gulph below.\r\n\r\nVathek would have followed the perfidious Giaour, had not an invisible\r\nagency arrested his progress.  The multitude that pressed after him were\r\nat once checked in the same manner, and a calm instantaneously ensued.\r\nThey all gazed at each other with an air of astonishment; and\r\nnotwithstanding that the loss of veils and turbans, together with torn\r\nhabits, and dust blended with sweat, presented a most laughable\r\nspectacle, there was not one smile to be seen; on the contrary, all with\r\nlooks of confusion and sadness returned in silence to Samarah, and\r\nretired to their inmost apartments, without ever reflecting that they had\r\nbeen impelled by an invisible power into the extravagance for which they\r\nreproached themselves: for it is but just, that men who so often arrogate\r\nto their own merit the good of which they are but instruments, should\r\nattribute to themselves the absurdities which they could not prevent.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph was the only person that refused to leave the valley.  He\r\ncommanded his tents to be pitched there, and stationed himself on the\r\nvery edge of the precipice, in spite of the representations of Carathis\r\nand Morakanabad, who pointed out the hazard of its brink giving way, and\r\nthe vicinity to the magician that had so severely tormented him.  Vathek\r\nderided all their remonstrances; and having ordered a thousand flambeaus\r\nto be lighted, and directed his attendants to proceed in lighting more,\r\nlay down on the slippery margin, and attempted, by the help of this\r\nartificial splendour, to look through that gloom which all the fires of\r\nthe empyrean had been insufficient to pervade.  One while he fancied to\r\nhimself voices arising from the depth of the gulph, at another he seemed\r\nto distinguish the accents of the Indian, but all was no more than the\r\nhollow murmur of waters, and the din of the cataracts that rushed from\r\nsteep to steep, down the sides of the mountain.\r\n\r\nHaving passed the night in this cruel perturbation, the Caliph at\r\nday-break retired to his tent, where, without taking the least\r\nsustenance, he continued to doze till the dusk of evening began to come\r\non; he then resumed his vigils as before, and persevered in observing\r\nthem for many nights together.  At length, fatigued with so successless\r\nan employment, he sought relief from change.  To this end he sometimes\r\npaced with hasty strides across the plain; and as he wildly gazed at the\r\nstars, reproached them with having deceived him; but lo! on a sudden the\r\nclear blue sky appeared streaked over with streams of blood, which\r\nreached from the valley even to the city of Samarah.  As this awful\r\nphenomenon seemed to touch his tower, Vathek at first thought of\r\nrepairing thither to view it more distinctly, but feeling himself unable\r\nto advance, and being overcome with apprehension, he muffled up his face\r\nin his robe.\r\n\r\nTerrifying as these prodigies were, this impression upon him was no more\r\nthan momentary, and served only to stimulate his love of the marvellous.\r\nInstead, therefore, of returning to his palace, he persisted in the\r\nresolution of abiding where the Indian vanished from his view.  One\r\nnight, however, while he was walking as usual on the plain, the moon and\r\nthe stars at once were eclipsed, and a total darkness ensued.  The earth\r\ntrembled beneath him, and a voice came forth, the voice of the Giaour,\r\nwho in accents more sonorous than thunder, thus addressed him:\r\n\r\n“Would’st thou devote thyself to me? adore then the terrestrial\r\ninfluences, and abjure Mahomet.  On these conditions I will bring thee to\r\nthe palace of subterranean fire: there shalt thou behold, in immense\r\ndepositories, the treasures which the stars have promised thee, and which\r\nwill be conferred by those intelligences whom thou shalt thus render\r\npropitious.  It was from thence I brought my sabres; and it is there that\r\nSoliman Ben Daoud reposes, surrounded by the talismans that control the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nThe astonished Caliph trembled as he answered, yet in a style that showed\r\nhim to be no novice in preternatural adventures:\r\n\r\n“Where art thou?  Be present to my eyes; dissipate the gloom that\r\nperplexes me, and of which I deem thee the cause.  After the many\r\nflambeaus I have burnt to discover thee, thou mayest at least grant a\r\nglimpse of thy horrible visage.”\r\n\r\n“Abjure then Mahomet,” replied the Indian, “and promise me full proofs of\r\nthy sincerity; otherwise thou shalt never behold me again.”\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Caliph, instigated by insatiable curiosity, lavished his\r\npromises in the utmost profusion.  The sky immediately brightened; and by\r\nthe light of the planets, which seemed almost to blaze, Vathek beheld the\r\nearth open, and at the extremity of a vast black chasm a portal of ebony,\r\nbefore which stood the Indian, still blacker, holding in his hand a\r\ngolden key, that caused the lock to resound.\r\n\r\n“How,” cried Vathek, “can I descend to thee, without the certainty of\r\nbreaking my neck?  Come take me, and instantly open the portal.”\r\n\r\n“Not so fast,” replied the Indian, “impatient Caliph!  Know that I am\r\nparched with thirst, and cannot open this door till my thirst be\r\nthoroughly appeased.  I require the blood of fifty of the most beautiful\r\nsons of thy viziers and great men, or neither can my thirst nor thy\r\ncuriosity be satisfied.  Return to Samarah; procure for me this necessary\r\nlibation; come back hither; throw it thyself into this chasm; and then\r\nshalt thou see!”\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken, the Indian turned his back on the Caliph, who,\r\nincited by the suggestion of demons, resolved on the direful sacrifice.\r\nHe now pretended to have regained his tranquillity, and set out for\r\nSamarah amidst the acclamations of a people who still loved him, and\r\nforbore not to rejoice when they believed him to have recovered his\r\nreason.  So successfully did he conceal the emotion of his heart, that\r\neven Carathis and Morakanabad were equally deceived with the rest.\r\nNothing was heard of but festivals and rejoicings.  The ball, which no\r\ntongue had hitherto ventured to mention, was again brought on the tapis.\r\nA general laugh went round; though many, still smarting under the hands\r\nof the surgeon, from the hurts received in that memorable adventure, had\r\nno great reason for mirth.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of this gay humour was not a little grateful to Vathek, as\r\nperceiving how much it conduced to his project.  He put on the appearance\r\nof affability to every one; but especially to his viziers, and the\r\ngrandees of his court, whom he failed not to regale with a sumptuous\r\nbanquet, during which he insensibly inclined the conversation to the\r\nchildren of his guests.  Having asked, with a good-natured air, who of\r\nthem were blessed with the handsomest boys, every father at once asserted\r\nthe pretensions of his own; and the contest imperceptibly grew so warm,\r\nthat nothing could have with-holden them from coming to blows but their\r\nprofound reverence for the person of the Caliph.  Under the pretence,\r\ntherefore, of reconciling the disputants, Vathek took upon him to decide;\r\nand with this view commanded the boys to be brought.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before a troop of these poor children made their\r\nappearance, all equipped by their fond mothers with such ornaments as\r\nmight give the greatest relief to their beauty, or most advantageously\r\ndisplay the graces of their age.  But whilst this brilliant assemblage\r\nattracted the eyes and hearts of every one besides, the Caliph\r\nscrutinized each in his turn with a malignant avidity that passed for\r\nattention, and selected from their number the fifty whom he judged the\r\nGiaour would prefer.\r\n\r\nWith an equal show of kindness as before, he proposed to celebrate a\r\nfestival on the plain, for the entertainment of his young favourites, who\r\nhe said ought to rejoice still more than all at the restoration of his\r\nhealth, on account of the favours he intended for them.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph’s proposal was received with the greatest delight, and soon\r\npublished through Samarah.  Litters, camels, and horses were prepared.\r\nWomen and children, old men and young—every one placed himself in the\r\nstation he chose.  The cavalcade set forward, attended by all the\r\nconfectioners in the city and its precincts.  The populace, following on\r\nfoot, composed an amazing crowd, and occasioned no little noise.  All was\r\njoy; nor did any one call to mind what most of them had suffered when\r\nthey first travelled the road they were now passing so gaily.\r\n\r\nThe evening was serene, the air refreshing, the sky clear, and the\r\nflowers exhaled their fragrance.  The beams of the declining sun, whose\r\nmild splendour reposed on the summit of the mountain, shed a glow of\r\nruddy light over its green declivity, and the white flocks sporting upon\r\nit.  No sounds were audible, save the murmurs of the four fountains, and\r\nthe reeds and voices of shepherds, calling to each other from different\r\neminences.\r\n\r\nThe lovely innocents, proceeding to the destined sacrifice, added not a\r\nlittle to the hilarity of the scene.  They approached the plain full of\r\nsportiveness; some coursing butterflies, others culling flowers, or\r\npicking up the shining little pebbles that attracted their notice.  At\r\nintervals, they nimbly started from each other, for the sake of being\r\ncaught again, and mutually imparting a thousand caresses.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful chasm, at whose bottom the portal of ebony was placed, began\r\nto appear at a distance.  It looked like a black streak that divided the\r\nplain.  Morakanabad and his companions took it for some work which the\r\nCaliph had ordered.  Unhappy men! little did they surmise for what it was\r\ndestined.\r\n\r\nVathek, not liking that they should examine it too nearly, stopped the\r\nprocession, and ordered a spacious circle to be formed on this side, at\r\nsome distance from the accursed chasm.  The body-guard of eunuchs was\r\ndetached, to measure out the lists intended for the games, and prepare\r\nringles for the lines to keep off the crowd.  The fifty competitors were\r\nsoon stripped, and presented to the admiration of the spectators the\r\nsuppleness and grace of their delicate limbs.  Their eyes sparkled with a\r\njoy which those of their fond parents reflected.  Every one offered\r\nwishes for the little candidate nearest his heart, and doubted not of his\r\nbeing victorious.  A breathless suspense awaited the contest of these\r\namiable and innocent victims.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph, availing himself of the first moment to retire from the\r\ncrowd, advanced towards the chasm, and there heard, yet not without\r\nshuddering, the voice of the Indian; who, gnashing his teeth, eagerly\r\ndemanded:\r\n\r\n“Where are they?  Where are they? perceivest thou not how my mouth\r\nwaters?”\r\n\r\n“Relentless Giaour!” answered Vathek, with emotion, “can nothing content\r\nthee but the massacre of these lovely victims?  Ah! wert thou to behold\r\ntheir beauty, it must certainly move thy compassion.”\r\n\r\n“Perdition on thy compassion, babbler!” cried the Indian.  “Give them me!\r\ninstantly give them, or my portal shall be closed against thee for ever!”\r\n\r\n“Not so loudly,” replied the Caliph, blushing.\r\n\r\n“I understand thee,” returned the Giaour, with the grin of an ogre: “thou\r\nwantest to summon up more presence of mind.  I will for a moment\r\nforbear.”\r\n\r\nDuring this exquisite dialogue the games went forward with all alacrity,\r\nand at length concluded, just as the twilight began to overcast the\r\nmountains.  Vathek, who was still standing on the edge of the chasm,\r\ncalled out with all his might:\r\n\r\n“Let my fifty little favourites approach me, separately; and let them\r\ncome in the order of their success.  To the first I will give my diamond\r\nbracelet; to the second my collar of emeralds; to the third my aigret of\r\nrubies; to the fourth my girdle of topazes; and to the rest, each a part\r\nof my dress, even down to my slippers.”\r\n\r\nThis declaration was received with reiterated acclamations; and all\r\nextolled the liberality of a prince who would thus strip himself for the\r\namusement of his subjects and the encouragement of the rising generation.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph in the mean while undressed himself by degrees; and raising\r\nhis arm as high as he was able, made each of the prizes glitter in the\r\nair; but, whilst he delivered it with one hand to the child, who sprang\r\nforward to receive it, he with the other pushed the poor innocent into\r\nthe gulph, where the Giaour, with a sullen muttering, incessantly\r\nrepeated “More! more!”\r\n\r\nThis dreadful device was executed with so much dexterity, that the boy\r\nwho was approaching him remained unconscious of the fate of his\r\nforerunner; and as to the spectators, the shades of evening, together\r\nwith their distance, precluded them from perceiving any object\r\ndistinctly.  Vathek, having in this manner thrown in the last of the\r\nfifty, and expecting that the Giaour on receiving him would have\r\npresented the key, already fancied himself as great as Soliman, and\r\nconsequently above being amenable for what he had done; when, to his\r\nutter amazement, the chasm closed, and the ground became as entire as the\r\nrest of the plain.\r\n\r\nNo language could express his rage and despair.  He execrated the perfidy\r\nof the Indian; loaded him with the most infamous invectives; and stamped\r\nwith his foot as resolving to be heard.  He persisted in this demeanour\r\ntill his strength failed him, and then fell on the earth like one void of\r\nsense.  His viziers and grandees, who were nearer than the rest, supposed\r\nhim at first to be sitting on the grass at play with their amiable\r\nchildren; but at length, prompted by doubt, they advanced towards the\r\nspot, and found the Caliph alone, who wildly demanded what they wanted.\r\n\r\n“Our children! our children!” cried they.\r\n\r\n“It is assuredly pleasant,” said he, “to make me accountable for\r\naccidents.  Your children, while at play, fell from the precipice that\r\nwas here; and I should have experienced their fate had I not been saved\r\nby a sudden start back.”\r\n\r\nAt these words, the fathers of the fifty boys cried out aloud: the\r\nmothers repeated their exclamations an octave higher; whilst the rest,\r\nwithout knowing the cause, soon drowned the voices of both, with still\r\nlouder lamentations of their own.\r\n\r\n“Our Caliph,” said they, and the report soon circulated, “Our Caliph has\r\nplayed us this trick, to gratify his accursed Giaour.  Let us punish him\r\nfor his perfidy! let us avenge ourselves! let us avenge the blood of the\r\ninnocent! let us throw this cruel Prince into the gulph that is near, and\r\nlet his name be mentioned no more!”\r\n\r\nAt this rumour, and these menaces, Carathis, full of consternation,\r\nhastened to Morakanabad, and said:\r\n\r\n“Vizier, you have lost two beautiful boys, and must necessarily be the\r\nmost afflicted of fathers; but you are virtuous; save your master!”\r\n\r\n“I will brave every hazard,” replied the Vizier, “to rescue him from his\r\npresent danger; but afterwards will abandon him to his fate.\r\nBababalouk,” continued he, “put yourself at the head of your Eunuchs,\r\ndisperse the mob, and if possible bring back this unhappy Prince to his\r\npalace.”\r\n\r\nBababalouk and his fraternity, felicitating each other in a low voice on\r\ntheir disability of ever being fathers, obeyed the mandate of the Vizier;\r\nwho, seconding their exertions to the utmost of his power, at length\r\naccomplished his generous enterprise, and retired, as he resolved, to\r\nlament at his leisure.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the Caliph re-entered his palace, than Carathis commanded\r\nthe doors to be fastened; but perceiving the tumult to be still violent,\r\nand hearing the imprecations which resounded from all quarters, she said\r\nto her son:\r\n\r\n“Whether the populace be right or wrong, it behoves you to provide for\r\nyour safety: let us retire to your own apartment, and from thence,\r\nthrough the subterranean passage known only to ourselves, into your\r\ntower; there, with the assistance of the mutes who never leave it, we may\r\nbe able to make some resistance.  Bababalouk, supposing us to be still in\r\nthe palace, will guard its avenues for his own sake; and we shall soon\r\nfind, without the counsels of that blubberer Morakanabad, what expedient\r\nmay be the best to adopt.”\r\n\r\nVathek, without making the least reply, acquiesced in his mother’s\r\nproposal, and repeated as he went:\r\n\r\n“Nefarious Giaour! where art thou? hast thou not yet devoured those poor\r\nchildren? where are thy sabres? thy golden key? thy talismans?”\r\n\r\nCarathis, who guessed from these interrogations a part of the truth, had\r\nno difficulty to apprehend in getting at the whole, as soon as he should\r\nbe a little composed in his tower.  This Princess was so far from being\r\ninfluenced by scruples that she was as wicked as woman could be, which is\r\nnot saying a little, for the sex pique themselves on their superiority in\r\nevery competition.  The recital of the Caliph therefore occasioned\r\nneither terror nor surprise to his mother; she felt no emotion but from\r\nthe promises of the Giaour; and said to her son:\r\n\r\n“This Giaour, it must be confessed, is somewhat sanguinary in his taste,\r\nbut the terrestrial powers are always terrible: nevertheless, what the\r\none has promised and the others can confer, will prove a sufficient\r\nindemnification.  No crimes should be thought too dear for such a reward.\r\nForbear then to revile the Indian: you have not fulfilled the conditions\r\nto which his services are annexed.  For instance, is not a sacrifice to\r\nthe subterranean Genii required? and should we not be prepared to offer\r\nit as soon as the tumult is subsided?  This charge I will take on myself,\r\nand have no doubt of succeeding by means of your treasures; which, as\r\nthere are now so many others in store, may without fear be exhausted.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Princess, who possessed the most consummate skill in the\r\nart of persuasion, went immediately back through the subterranean\r\npassage, and presenting herself to the populace from a window of the\r\npalace, began to harangue them with all the address of which she was\r\nmistress, whilst Bababalouk showered money from both hands amongst the\r\ncrowd, who by these united means were soon appeased.  Every person\r\nretired to his home, and Carathis returned to the tower.\r\n\r\nPrayer at break of day was announced, when Carathis and Vathek ascended\r\nthe steps which led to the summit of the tower, where they remained for\r\nsome time, though the weather was lowering and wet.  This impending gloom\r\ncorresponded with their malignant dispositions; but when the sun began to\r\nbreak through the clouds, they ordered a pavilion to be raised as a\r\nscreen from the intrusion of his beams.  The Caliph, overcome with\r\nfatigue, sought refreshment from repose, at the same time hoping that\r\nsignificant dreams might attend on his slumbers; whilst the indefatigable\r\nCarathis, followed by a party of her mutes, descended to prepare whatever\r\nshe judged proper for the oblation of the approaching night.\r\n\r\nBy secret stairs, known only to herself and her son, she first repaired\r\nto the mysterious recesses in which were deposited the mummies that had\r\nbeen brought from the catacombs of the ancient Pharaohs.  Of these she\r\nordered several to be taken.  From thence she resorted to a gallery,\r\nwhere, under the guard of fifty female negroes, mute, and blind of the\r\nright eye, were preserved the oil of the most venomous serpents,\r\nrhinoceros’ horns, and woods of a subtle and penetrating odour, procured\r\nfrom the interior of the Indies, together with a thousand other horrible\r\nrarieties.  This collection had been formed for a purpose like the\r\npresent, by Carathis herself, from a presentiment that she might one day\r\nenjoy some intercourse with the infernal powers, to whom she had ever\r\nbeen passionately attached, and to whose taste she was no stranger.\r\n\r\nTo familiarize herself the better with the horrors in view, the Princess\r\nremained in the company of her negresses, who squinted in the most\r\namiable manner from the only eye they had, and leered with exquisite\r\ndelight at the skulls and skeletons which Carathis had drawn forth from\r\nher cabinets, whose key she entrusted to no one; all of them making\r\ncontortions, and uttering a frightful jargon, but very amusing to the\r\nPrincess till at last, being stunned by their gibbering, and suffocated\r\nby the potency of their exhalations, she was forced to quit the gallery,\r\nafter stripping it of a part of its treasures.\r\n\r\nWhilst she was thus occupied, the Caliph, who instead of the visions he\r\nexpected, had acquired in these insubstantial regions a voracious\r\nappetite, was greatly provoked at the negresses: for, having totally\r\nforgotten their deafness, he had impatiently asked them for food; and\r\nseeing them regardless of his demand, he began to cuff, pinch, and push\r\nthem, till Carathis arrived to terminate a scene so indecent, to the\r\ngreat content of these miserable creatures, who having been brought up by\r\nher, understood all her signs, and communicated in the same way their\r\nthoughts in return.\r\n\r\n“Son! what means all this?” said she, panting for breath.  “I thought I\r\nheard as I came up, the shrieks of a thousand bats, tearing from their\r\ncrannies in the recesses of a cavern, and it was the outcry only of these\r\npoor mutes, whom you were so unmercifully abusing.  In truth you but ill\r\ndeserve the admirable provision I have brought you.”\r\n\r\n“Give it me instantly!” exclaimed the Caliph: “I am perishing for\r\nhunger!”\r\n\r\n“As to that,” answered she, “you must have an excellent stomach if it can\r\ndigest what I have been preparing.”\r\n\r\n“Be quick,” replied the Caliph.  “But oh, heavens! what horrors!  What do\r\nyou intend?”\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” returned Carathis, “be not so squeamish, but help me to\r\narrange every thing properly, and you shall see that what you reject with\r\nsuch symptoms of disgust will soon complete your felicity.  Let us get\r\nready the pile for the sacrifice of to-night, and think not of eating\r\ntill that is performed.  Know you not that all solemn rites are preceded\r\nby a rigorous abstinence?”\r\n\r\nThe Caliph, not daring to object, abandoned himself to grief, and the\r\nwind that ravaged his entrails, whilst his mother went forward with the\r\nrequisite operations.  Phials of serpents’ oil, mummies, and bones, were\r\nsoon set in order on the balustrade of the tower.  The pile began to\r\nrise; and in three hours was as many cubits high.  At length, darkness\r\napproached, and Carathis having stripped herself to her inmost garment,\r\nclapped her hands in an impulse of ecstasy, and struck light with all her\r\nforce.  The mutes followed her example: but Vathek, extenuated with\r\nhunger and impatience, was unable to support himself, and fell down in a\r\nswoon.  The sparks had already kindled the dry wood; the venomous oil\r\nburst into a thousand blue flames; the mummies, dissolving, emitted a\r\nthick dun vapour; and the rhinoceros’ horns beginning to consume; all\r\ntogether diffused such a stench, that the Caliph, recovering, started\r\nfrom his trance and gazed wildly on the scene in full blaze around him.\r\nThe oil gushed forth in a plentitude of streams; and the negresses, who\r\nsupplied it without intermission, united their cries to those of the\r\nPrincess.  At last the fire became so violent, and the flames reflected\r\nfrom the polished marble so dazzling, that the Caliph, unable to\r\nwithstand the heat and the blaze, effected his escape, and clambered up\r\nthe imperial standard.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the inhabitants of Samarah, scared at the light which\r\nshone over the city, arose in haste, ascended their roofs, beheld the\r\ntower on fire, and hurried half-naked to the square.  Their love to their\r\nsovereign immediately awoke; and apprehending him in danger of perishing\r\nin his tower, their whole thoughts were occupied with the means of his\r\nsafety.  Morakanabad flew from his retirement, wiped away his tears, and\r\ncried out for water like the rest.  Bababalouk, whose olfactory nerves\r\nwere more familiarized to magical odours, readily conjecturing that\r\nCarathis was engaged in her favourite amusements, strenuously exhorted\r\nthem not to be alarmed.  Him, however, they treated as an old poltroon;\r\nand forbore not to style him a rascally traitor.  The camels and\r\ndromedaries were advancing with water, but no one knew by which way to\r\nenter the tower.  Whilst the populace was obstinate in forcing the doors,\r\na violent east wind drove such a volume of flame against them, as at\r\nfirst forced them off; but afterwards, rekindled their zeal.  At the same\r\ntime, the stench of the horns and mummies increasing, most of the crowd\r\nfell backward in a state of suffocation.  Those that kept their feet\r\nmutually wondered at the cause of the smell, and admonished each other to\r\nretire.  Morakanabad, more sick than the rest, remained in a piteous\r\ncondition.  Holding his nose with one hand, he persisted in his efforts\r\nwith the other to burst open the doors, and obtain admission.  A hundred\r\nand forty of the strongest and most resolute at length accomplished their\r\npurpose.  Having gained the staircase by their violent exertions, they\r\nattained a great height in a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nCarathis, alarmed at the signs of her mutes, advanced to the staircase,\r\nwent down a few steps, and heard several voices calling out from below:\r\n\r\n“You shall in a moment have water!”\r\n\r\nBeing rather alert, considering her age, she presently regained the top\r\nof the tower, and bade her son suspend the sacrifice for some minutes,\r\nadding:\r\n\r\n“We shall soon be enabled to render it more grateful.  Certain dolts of\r\nyour subjects, imagining, no doubt, that we were on fire, have been rash\r\nenough to break through those doors, which had hitherto remained\r\ninviolate, for the sake of bringing up water.  They are very kind, you\r\nmust allow, so soon to forget the wrongs you have done them: but that is\r\nof little moment.  Let us offer them to the Giaour.  Let them come up:\r\nour mutes, who neither want strength nor experience, will soon despatch\r\nthem, exhausted as they are with fatigue.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so,” answered the Caliph, “provided we finish, and I dine.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, these good people, out of breath from ascending eleven thousand\r\nstairs in such haste, and chagrined at having spilt, by the way, the\r\nwater they had taken, were no sooner arrived at the top than the blaze of\r\nthe flames and the fumes of the mummies at once overpowered their senses.\r\nIt was a pity! for they beheld not the agreeable smile with which the\r\nmutes and the negresses adjusted the cord to their necks: these amiable\r\npersonages rejoiced, however, no less at the scene.  Never before had the\r\nceremony of strangling been performed with so much facility.  They all\r\nfell without the least resistance or struggle; so that Vathek, in the\r\nspace of a few moments, found himself surrounded by the dead bodies of\r\nhis most faithful subjects, all of which were thrown on the top of the\r\npile.\r\n\r\nCarathis, whose presence of mind never forsook her, perceiving that she\r\nhad carcases sufficient to complete her oblation, commanded the chains to\r\nbe stretched across the staircase, and the iron doors barricaded, that no\r\nmore might come up.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were these orders obeyed, than the tower shook; the dead bodies\r\nvanished in the flames; which at once changed from a swarthy crimson to a\r\nbright rose colour.  An ambient vapour emitted the most exquisite\r\nfragrance; the marble columns rang with harmonious sounds, and the\r\nliquefied horns diffused a delicious perfume.  Carathis, in transports,\r\nanticipated the success of her enterprise; whilst the mutes and\r\nnegresses, to whom these sweets had given the cholic, retired to their\r\ncells grumbling.\r\n\r\nScarcely were they gone, when, instead of the pile, horns, mummies, and\r\nashes, the Caliph both saw and felt, with a degree of pleasure which he\r\ncould not express, a table, covered with the most magnificent repast:\r\nflaggons of wine, and vases of exquisite sherbet, floating on snow.  He\r\navailed himself, without scruple, of such an entertainment; and had\r\nalready laid hands on a lamb stuffed with pistachios, whilst Carathis was\r\nprivately drawing from a fillagreen urn, a parchment that seemed to be\r\nendless; and which had escaped the notice of her son.  Totally occupied,\r\nin gratifying an importunate appetite, he left her to peruse it, without\r\ninterruption; which having finished, she said to him, in an authoritative\r\ntone,\r\n\r\n“Put an end to your gluttony, and hear the splendid promises with which\r\nyou are favoured!”  She then read, as follows:\r\n\r\n“Vathek, my well-beloved, thou hast surpassed my hopes: my nostrils have\r\nbeen regaled by the savour of thy mummies, thy horns; and, still more, by\r\nthe lives devoted on the pile.  At the full of the moon, cause the bands\r\nof thy musicians, and thy tymbals, to be heard; depart from thy palace\r\nsurrounded by all the pageants of majesty; thy most faithful slaves, thy\r\nbest beloved wives; thy most magnificent litters; thy richest loaden\r\ncamels; and set forward on thy way to Istakar.  There await I thy coming.\r\nThat is the region of wonders.  There shalt thou receive the diadem of\r\nGian Ben Gian, {50} the talismans of Soliman, and the treasures of the\r\npreadimite Sultans: there shalt thou be solaced with all kinds of\r\ndelight.  But, beware how thou enterest any dwelling on thy route, or\r\nthou shalt feel the effects of my anger.”\r\n\r\nThe Caliph, who, notwithstanding his habitual luxury, had never before\r\ndined with so much satisfaction, gave full scope to the joy of these\r\ngolden tidings, and betook himself to drinking anew.  Carathis, whose\r\nantipathy to wine was by no means insuperable, failed not to supply a\r\nreason for every bumper, which they ironically quaffed to the health of\r\nMahomet.  This infernal liquor completed their impious temerity, and\r\nprompted them to utter a profusion of blasphemies.  They gave a loose to\r\ntheir wit, at the expense of the ass of Balaam, the dog of the seven\r\nsleepers, and the other animals admitted into the paradise of Mahomet.\r\nIn this sprightly humour they descended the eleven thousand stairs,\r\ndiverting themselves as they went at the anxious faces they saw on the\r\nsquare, through the oilets of the tower, and at length arrived at the\r\nroyal apartments by the subterranean passage.  Bababalouk was parading to\r\nand fro, and issuing his mandates with great pomp to the eunuchs, who\r\nwere snuffing the lights and painting the eyes of the Circassians.  No\r\nsooner did he catch sight of the Caliph and his mother than he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n“Hah! you have then, I perceive, escaped from the flames; I was not,\r\nhowever, altogether out of doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Of what moment is it to us what you thought or think?” cried Carathis\r\n“go, speed, tell Morakanabad that we immediately want him; and take care\r\nhow you stop by the way to make your insipid reflections.”\r\n\r\nMorakanabad delayed not to obey the summons, and was received by Vathek\r\nand his mother with great solemnity.  They told him with an air of\r\ncomposure and commiseration that the fire at the top of the tower was\r\nextinguished, but that it had cost the lives of the brave people who\r\nsought to assist them.\r\n\r\n“Still more misfortunes!” cried Morakanabad with a sigh.  “Ah, commander\r\nof the faithful, our holy prophet is certainly irritated against us! it\r\nbehoves you to appease him.”\r\n\r\n“We will appease him hereafter,” replied the Caliph, with a smile that\r\naugured nothing of good.  “You will have leisure sufficient for your\r\nsupplications during my absence; for this country is the bane of my\r\nhealth.  I am disgusted with the mountain of the Four Fountains, and am\r\nresolved to go and drink of the stream of Rocnabad. {51}  I long to\r\nrefresh myself in the delightful valleys which it waters.  Do you, with\r\nthe advice of my mother, govern my dominions; and take care to supply\r\nwhatever her experiments may demand; for you well know that our tower\r\nabounds in materials for the advancement of science.”\r\n\r\nThe tower but ill suited Morakanabad’s taste.  Immense treasures had been\r\nlavished upon it, and nothing had he ever seen carried thither but female\r\nnegroes, mutes, and abominable drugs.  Nor did he know well what to think\r\nof Carathis, who like a chamelion could assume all possible colours.  Her\r\ncursed eloquence had often driven the poor Mussulman to his last shifts.\r\nHe considered, however, that if she possessed but few good qualities, her\r\nson had still fewer, and that the alternative, on the whole, would be in\r\nher favour.  Consoled, therefore, with this reflection, he went in good\r\nspirits to soothe the populace, and make the proper arrangements for his\r\nmaster’s journey.\r\n\r\nVathek, to conciliate the spirits of the subterranean palace, resolved\r\nthat his expedition should be uncommonly splendid.  With this view he\r\nconfiscated on all sides the property of his subjects, whilst his worthy\r\nmother stripped the seraglios she visited of the gems they contained.\r\nShe collected all the sempstresses and embroiderers of Samarah, and other\r\ncities, to the distance of sixty leagues, to prepare pavilions,\r\npalanquins, sofas, canopies, and litters, for the train of the monarch.\r\nThere was not left in Masulipatan a single piece of chintz; and so much\r\nmuslin had been bought up to dress out Bababalouk and the other black\r\neunuchs, that there remained not an ell in the whole Irak of Babylon.\r\n\r\nDuring these preparations, Carathis, who never lost sight of her great\r\nobject, which was to obtain favour with the powers of darkness, made\r\nselect parties of the fairest and most delicate ladies of the city; but\r\nin the midst of their gaiety she contrived to introduce serpents amongst\r\nthem, and to break pots of scorpions under the table.  They all bit to a\r\nwonder, and Carathis would have left them to bite, were it not that to\r\nfill up the time, she now and then amused herself in curing their wounds\r\nwith an excellent anodyne of her own invention; for this good princess\r\nabhorred being indolent.\r\n\r\nVathek, who was not altogether so active as his mother, devoted his time\r\nto the sole gratification of his senses, in the palaces which were\r\nseverally dedicated to them.  He disgusted himself no more with the divan\r\nor the mosque.  One half of Samarah followed his example, whilst the\r\nother lamented the progress of corruption.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these transactions, the embassy returned which had been\r\nsent in pious times to Mecca.  It consisted of the most reverend\r\nmoullahs, {53} who had fulfilled their commission, and brought back one\r\nof those precious besoms which are used to sweep the sacred caaba; a\r\npresent truly worthy of the greatest potentate on earth!\r\n\r\nThe Caliph happened at this instant to be engaged in an apartment by no\r\nmeans adapted to the reception of embassies, though adorned with a\r\ncertain magnificence, not only to render it agreeable, but also because\r\nhe resorted to it frequently, and staid a considerable time together.\r\nWhilst occupied in this retreat, he heard the voice of Bababalouk calling\r\nout from between the door and the tapestry that hung before it:\r\n\r\n“Here are the excellent Mahomet Ebn Edris al Shafei, and the seraphic Al\r\nMouhadethin, who have brought the besom from Mecca, and with tears of joy\r\nentreat they may present it to your majesty in person.”\r\n\r\n“Let them bring the besom hither, it may be of use,” said Vathek, who was\r\nstill employed, not having quite racked off his wine.\r\n\r\n“How!” answered Bababalouk, half aloud and amazed.\r\n\r\n“Obey,” replied the Caliph, “for it is my sovereign will; go instantly!\r\nvanish! for here will I receive the good folk who have thus filled thee\r\nwith joy.”\r\n\r\nThe eunuch departed muttering, and bade the venerable train attend him.\r\nA sacred rapture was diffused amongst these reverend old men.  Though\r\nfatigued with the length of their expedition, they followed Bababalouk\r\nwith an alertness almost miraculous, and felt themselves highly flattered\r\nas they swept along the stately porticos, that the Caliph would not\r\nreceive them like ambassadors in ordinary, in his hall of audience.  Soon\r\nreaching the interior of the harem (where, through blinds of persian they\r\nperceived large soft eyes, dark and blue, that went and came like\r\nlightning) penetrated with respect and wonder, and full of their\r\ncelestial mission, they advanced in procession towards the small\r\ncorridors that appeared to terminate in nothing, but nevertheless led to\r\nthe cell where the Caliph expected their coming.\r\n\r\n“What! is the commander of the faithful sick?” said Ebn Edris al Shafei,\r\nin a low voice to his companion.\r\n\r\n“I rather think he is in his oratory,” answered Al Mouhadethin.\r\n\r\nVathek, who heard the dialogue, cried out “What imports it you how I am\r\nemployed? approach without delay.”\r\n\r\nThey advanced, and Bababalouk almost sunk with confusion, {55} whilst the\r\nCaliph, without showing himself, put forth his hand from behind the\r\ntapestry that hung before the door, and demanded of them the besom.\r\n\r\nHaving prostrated themselves as well as the corridor would permit, and\r\neven in a tolerable semi-circle, the venerable Al Shafei, drawing forth\r\nthe besom from the embroidered and perfumed scarfs in which it had been\r\nenveloped, and secured from the profane gaze of vulgar eyes, arose from\r\nhis associates and advanced with an air of the most awful solemnity\r\ntowards the supposed oratory; but with what astonishment! with what\r\nhorror was he seized!\r\n\r\nVathek, bursting out into a villainous laugh, snatched the besom from his\r\ntrembling hand, and fixing upon it some cobwebs that hung suspended from\r\nthe ceiling, gravely brushed away till not a single one remained.\r\n\r\nThe old men, overpowered with amazement, were unable to lift their beards\r\nfrom the ground; for as Vathek had carelessly left the tapestry between\r\nthem half drawn, they were witnesses to the whole transaction.  Their\r\ntears gushed forth on the marble.  Al Mouhadethin swooned through\r\nmortification and fatigue, whilst the Caliph, throwing himself backward\r\non his seat, shouted and clapped his hands without mercy.  At last,\r\naddressing himself to Bababalouk:\r\n\r\n“My dear black,” said he, “go, regale these pious poor souls with my good\r\nwine from Shiraz; and as they can boast of having seen more of my palace\r\nthan any one besides, let them also visit my office courts, and lead them\r\nout by the back steps that go to my stables.”  Having said this, he threw\r\nthe besom in their face, and went to enjoy the laugh with Carathis.\r\n\r\nBababalouk did all in his power to console the ambassadors, but the two\r\nmost infirm expired on the spot; the rest were carried to their beds,\r\nfrom whence, being heart-broken with sorrow and shame, they never arose.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding night, Vathek, attended by his mother, ascended the tower\r\nto see if everything were ready for his journey, for he had great faith\r\nin the influence of the stars.  The planets appeared in their most\r\nfavourable aspects.  The Caliph, to enjoy so flattering a sight, supped\r\ngaily on the roof, and fancied that he heard, during his repast, loud\r\nshouts of laughter resound through the sky, in a manner that inspired the\r\nfullest assurance.\r\n\r\nAll was in motion at the palace; lights were kept burning through the\r\nwhole of the night; the sound of implements, and of artisans finishing\r\ntheir work; the voices of women and their guardians who sung at their\r\nembroidery; all conspired to interrupt the stillness of nature, and\r\ninfinitely delight the heart of Vathek, who imagined himself going in\r\ntriumph to sit upon the throne of Soliman.\r\n\r\nThe people were not less satisfied than himself; all assisted to\r\naccelerate the moment which should rescue them from the wayward caprices\r\nof so extravagant a master.\r\n\r\nThe day preceding the departure of this infatuated prince was employed by\r\nCarathis in repeating to him the decrees of the mysterious parchment,\r\nwhich she had thoroughly gotten by heart; and in recommending him not to\r\nenter the habitation of any one by the way; “for well thou knowest,”\r\nadded she, “how liquorish thy taste is after good dishes and young\r\ndamsels; let me therefore enjoin thee to be content with thy old cooks,\r\nwho are the best in the world; and not to forget that in thy ambulatory\r\nseraglio there are three dozen pretty faces, which Bababalouk hath not\r\nyet unveiled.  I, myself, have a great desire to watch over thy conduct,\r\nand visit the subterranean palace, which no doubt contains whatever can\r\ninterest persons like us.  There is nothing so pleasing as retiring to\r\ncaverns; my taste for dead bodies and everything like mummy is decided;\r\nand I am confident thou wilt see the most exquisite of their kind.\r\nForget me not then, but the moment thou art in possession of the\r\ntalismans which are to open to thee the mineral kingdoms, and the centre\r\nof the earth itself, fail not to dispatch some trusty genius to take me\r\nand my cabinet, for the oil of the serpents I have pinched to death will\r\nbe a pretty present to the Giaour, who cannot but be charmed with such\r\ndainties.”\r\n\r\nScarcely had Carathis ended this edifying discourse, when the sun,\r\nsetting behind the mountain of the Four Fountains, gave place to the\r\nrising moon.  This planet being that evening at full, appeared of unusual\r\nbeauty and magnitude in the eyes of the women, the eunuchs, and the\r\npages, who were all impatient to set forward.  The city re-echoed with\r\nshouts of joy and flourishing of trumpets.  Nothing was visible but\r\nplumes nodding on pavilions, and aigrets shining in the mild lustre of\r\nthe moon.  The spacious square resembled an immense parterre, variegated\r\nwith the most stately tulips of the east.\r\n\r\nArrayed in the robes which were only worn at the most distinguished\r\nceremonials, and supported by his vizier and Bababalouk, the Caliph\r\ndescended the grand staircase of the tower in the sight of all his\r\npeople.  He could not forbear pausing at intervals to admire the superb\r\nappearance which everywhere courted his view, whilst the whole multitude,\r\neven to the camels with their sumptuous burdens, knelt down before him.\r\nFor some time a general stillness prevailed, which nothing happened to\r\ndisturb, but the shrill screams of some eunuchs in the rear.  These\r\nvigilant guards having remarked certain cages of the ladies swagging\r\nsomewhat awry, and discovered that a few adventurous gallants had\r\ncontrived to get in, soon dislodged the enraptured culprits, and\r\nconsigned them with good commendations, to the surgeons of the serail.\r\nThe majesty of so magnificent a spectacle was not, however, violated by\r\nincidents like these.  Vathek, meanwhile, saluted the moon with an\r\nidolatrous air, that neither pleased Morakanabad nor the doctors of the\r\nlaw, any more than the viziers and grandees of his court, who were all\r\nassembled to enjoy the last view of their sovereign.\r\n\r\nAt length the clarions and trumpets from the top of the tower announced\r\nthe prelude of departure.  Though the instruments were in unison with\r\neach other, yet a singular dissonance was blended with their sounds.\r\nThis proceeded from Carathis, who was singing her direful orisons to the\r\nGiaour, whilst the negresses and mutes supplied thorough bass without\r\narticulating a word.  The good Mussulmans fancied that they heard the\r\nsullen hum of those nocturnal insects which presage evil, and importuned\r\nVathek to beware how he ventured his sacred person.\r\n\r\nOn a given signal the great standard of the Califat was displayed; twenty\r\nthousand lances shone around it; and the Caliph, treading royally on the\r\ncloth of gold which had been spread for his feet, ascended his litter\r\namidst the general awe that possessed his subjects.\r\n\r\nThe expedition commenced with the utmost order, and so entire a silence,\r\nthat even the locusts were heard from the thickets on the plain of\r\nCatoul.  Gaiety and good humour prevailing, six good leagues were past\r\nbefore the dawn; and the morning star was still glittering in the\r\nfirmament when the whole of this numerous train had halted on the banks\r\nof the Tigris, where they encamped to repose for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nThe three days that followed were spent in the same manner, but on the\r\nfourth the heavens looked angry, lightnings broke forth in frequent\r\nflashes, re-echoing peals of thunder succeeded, and the trembling\r\nCircassians clung with all their might to their ugly guardians.  The\r\nCaliph himself was greatly inclined to take shelter in the large town of\r\nGulchissar, the governor of which came forth to meet him, and tendered\r\nevery kind of refreshment the place could supply.  But having examined\r\nhis tablets, he suffered the rain to soak him almost to the bone,\r\nnotwithstanding the importunity of his first favourites.  Though he began\r\nto regret the palace of the senses, yet he lost not sight of his\r\nenterprise, and his sanguine expectations confirmed his resolution.  His\r\ngeographers were ordered to attend him, but the weather proved so\r\nterrible, that these poor people exhibited a lamentable appearance; and\r\nas no long journeys had been undertaken since the time of Haroun al\r\nRaschid, their maps of the different countries were in a still worse\r\nplight than themselves.  Every one was ignorant which way to turn; for\r\nVathek, though well versed in the course of the heavens, no longer knew\r\nhis situation on earth.  He thundered even louder than the elements, and\r\nmuttered forth certain hints of the bowstring which were not very\r\nsoothing to literary ears.  Disgusted at the toilsome weariness of the\r\nway, he determined to cross over the craggy heights, and follow the\r\nguidance of a peasant, who undertook to bring him, in four days, to\r\nRocnabad.  Remonstrances were all to no purpose, his resolution was\r\nfixed, and an invasion commenced on the province of the goats, who sped\r\naway in large troops before them.  It was curious to view on these half\r\ncalcined rocks camels richly caparisoned, and pavilions of gold and silk\r\nwaving on their summits, which till then had never been covered, but with\r\nsapless thistles and fern.\r\n\r\nThe females and eunuchs uttered shrill wailings at the sight of the\r\nprecipices below them, and the dreary prospects that opened in the vast\r\ngorges of the mountains.  Before they could reach the ascent of the\r\nsteepest rock night overtook them, and a boisterous tempest arose, which\r\nhaving rent the awnings of the palanquins and cages, exposed to the raw\r\ngusts the poor ladies within, who had never before felt so piercing a\r\ncold.  The dark clouds that overcast the face of the sky deepened the\r\nhorrors of this disastrous night, insomuch that nothing could be heard\r\ndistinctly but the mewling of pages, and lamentations of sultanas.\r\n\r\nTo increase the general misfortune, the frightful uproar of wild beasts\r\nresounded at a distance, and there were soon perceived in the forest they\r\nwere skirting the glaring of eyes which could belong only to devils or\r\ntigers.  The pioneers, who as well as they could, had marked out a track,\r\nand a part of the advanced guard were devoured before they had been in\r\nthe least apprised of their danger.  The confusion that prevailed was\r\nextreme.  Wolves, tigers, and other carnivorous animals, invited by the\r\nhowling of their companions, flocked together from every quarter.  The\r\ncrushing of bones was heard on all sides, and a fearful rush of wings\r\nover head, for now vultures also began to be of the party.\r\n\r\nThe terror at length reached the main body of the troops which surrounded\r\nthe monarch and his harem, at the distance of two leagues from the scene.\r\nVathek (voluptuously reposed in his capacious litter upon cushions of\r\nsilk, with two little pages beside him, of complexions more fair than the\r\nenamel of Franguestan, who were occupied in keeping off flies) was\r\nsoundly asleep, and contemplating in his dreams the treasures of Soliman.\r\nThe shrieks, however, of his wives awoke him with a start, and instead of\r\nthe Giaour with his key of gold, he beheld Bababalouk full of\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\n“Sire,” exclaimed this good servant of the most potent of monarchs,\r\n“misfortune has arrived at its height; wild beasts, who entertain no more\r\nreverence for your sacred person than for that of a dead ass, have beset\r\nyour camels and their drivers: thirty of the richest laden are already\r\nbecome their prey, as well as all your confectioners, your cooks, and\r\npurveyors, and unless our holy prophet should protect us, we shall have\r\nall eaten our last meal.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of eating, the Caliph lost all patience.  He began to\r\nbellow, and even beat himself, for there was no seeing in the dark.  The\r\nrumour every instant increased, and Bababalouk finding no good could be\r\ndone with his master stopped both his ears against the hurly-burly of the\r\nharem, and called out aloud:\r\n\r\n“Come, ladies and brothers! all hands to work! strike light in a moment!\r\nnever shall it be said that the commander of the faithful served to\r\nregale these infidel brutes.”\r\n\r\nThough there wanted not in this bevy of beauties a sufficient number of\r\ncapricious and wayward, yet, on the present occasion they were all\r\ncompliance.  Fires were visible in a twinkling in all their cages.  Ten\r\nthousand torches were lighted at once.  The Caliph himself seized a large\r\none of wax; every person followed his example; and by kindling ropes ends\r\ndipped in oil and fastened on poles, an amazing blaze was spread.  The\r\nrocks were covered with the splendour of sunshine.  The trails of sparks\r\nwafted by the wind, communicated to the dry fern, of which there was\r\nplenty.  Serpents were observed to crawl forth from their retreats with\r\namazement and hissings, whilst the horses snorted, stamped the ground,\r\ntossed their noses in the air, and plunged about without mercy.\r\n\r\nOne of the forests of cedar that bordered their way took fire, and the\r\nbranches that overhung the path extending their flames to the muslins and\r\nchintzes which covered the cages of the ladies, obliged them to jump out\r\nat the peril of their necks.  Vathek, who vented on the occasion a\r\nthousand blasphemies, was himself compelled to touch with his sacred feet\r\nthe naked earth.\r\n\r\nNever had such an incident happened before.  Full of mortification, shame\r\nand despondence, and not knowing how to walk, the ladies fell into the\r\ndirt.\r\n\r\n“Must I go on foot,” said one.\r\n\r\n“Must I wet my feet,” cried another.\r\n\r\n“Must I soil my dress,” asked a third.\r\n\r\n“Execrable Bababalouk,” exclaimed all; “Outcast of hell! what hadst thou\r\nto do with torches?  Better were it to be eaten by tigers than to fall\r\ninto our present condition; we are for ever undone.  Not a porter is\r\nthere in the army, nor a currier of camels but hath seen some part of our\r\nbodies, and what is worse, our very faces!”\r\n\r\nOn saying this, the most bashful amongst them hid their foreheads on the\r\nground, whilst such as had more boldness flew at Bababalouk, but he, well\r\napprised of their humour, and not wanting in shrewdness, betook himself\r\nto his heels along with his comrades, all dropping their torches and\r\nstriking their tymbals.\r\n\r\nIt was not less light than in the brightest of the dog-days, and the\r\nweather was hot in proportion; but how degrading was the spectacle, to\r\nbehold the Caliph bespattered like an ordinary mortal!  As the exercise\r\nof his faculties seemed to be suspended, one of his Ethiopian wives (for\r\nhe delighted in variety) clasped him in her arms, threw him upon her\r\nshoulder like a sack of dates, and finding that the fire was hemming them\r\nin, set off with no small expedition, considering the weight of her\r\nburden.  The other ladies who had just learned the use of their feet\r\nfollowed her; their guards galloped after; and the camel drivers brought\r\nup the rear as fast as their charge would permit.\r\n\r\nThey soon reached the spot where the wild beasts had commenced the\r\ncarnage, and which they had too much spirit to leave, notwithstanding the\r\napproaching tumult, and the luxurious supper they had made.  Bababalouk\r\nnevertheless seized on a few of the plumpest, which were unable to budge\r\nfrom the place, and began to flay them with admirable adroitness.  The\r\ncavalcade being got so far from the conflagration as that the heat felt\r\nrather grateful than violent, it was immediately resolved on to halt.\r\nThe tattered chintzes were picked up; the scraps left by the wolves and\r\ntigers interred; and vengeance was taken on some dozens of vultures that\r\nwere too much glutted to rise on the wing.  The camels which had been\r\nleft unmolested to make sal-ammoniac being numbered, and the ladies once\r\nmore inclosed in their cages, the imperial tent was pitched on the\r\nlevellest ground they could find.\r\n\r\nVathek, reposing upon a matress of down, and tolerably recovered from the\r\njolting of the Ethiopian, who, to his feelings seemed the roughest\r\ntrotting jade he had hitherto mounted, called out for something to eat;\r\nbut alas! those delicate cakes which had been baked in silver ovens for\r\nhis royal mouth, those rich manchets, amber comfits, flaggons of Schiraz\r\nwine, porcelain vases of snow, and grapes from the banks of the Tigris,\r\nwere all irremediably lost; and nothing had Bababalouk to present in\r\ntheir stead, but a roasted wolf, vultures à la daube, aromatic herbs of\r\nthe most acrid poignancy, rotten truffles, boiled thistles, and such\r\nother wild plants as must ulcerate the throat and parch up the tongue.\r\nNor was he better provided in the article of drink, for he could procure\r\nnothing to accompany these irritating viands but a few phials of\r\nabominable brandy, which had been secreted by the scullions in their\r\nslippers.\r\n\r\nVathek made wry faces at so savage a repast, and Bababalouk answered them\r\nwith shrugs and contortions.  The Caliph however ate with tolerable\r\nappetite, and fell into a nap that lasted six hours.  The splendour of\r\nthe sun, reflected from the white cliffs of the mountains in spite of the\r\ncurtains that inclosed him, at length disturbed his repose.  He awoke\r\nterrified, and stung to the quick by those wormwood-coloured flies which\r\nemit from their wings a suffocating stench.  The miserable monarch was\r\nperplexed how to act, though his wits were not idle in seeking\r\nexpedients, whilst Bababalouk lay snoring amidst a swarm of those\r\ninsects, that busily thronged to pay court to his nose.  The little\r\npages, famished with hunger, had dropped their fans on the ground, and\r\nexerted their dying voices in bitter reproaches on the Caliph, who now\r\nfor the first time heard the language of truth.\r\n\r\nThus stimulated, he renewed his imprecations against the Giaour, and\r\nbestowed upon Mahomet some soothing expressions.\r\n\r\n“Where am I?” cried he; “What are these dreadful rocks; these valleys of\r\ndarkness?  Are we arrived at the horrible Kaf? {67a}  Is the Simurgh\r\n{67b} coming to pluck out my eyes as a punishment for undertaking this\r\nimpious enterprise?”\r\n\r\nHaving said this, he bellowed like a calf, and turned himself towards an\r\noutlet in the side of his pavilion.  But alas! what objects occurred to\r\nhis view! on one side a plain of black sand that appeared to be\r\nunbounded, and on the other perpendicular crags bristled over with those\r\nabominable thistles which had so severely lacerated his tongue.  He\r\nfancied, however, that he perceived amongst the brambles and briars some\r\ngigantic flowers, but was mistaken, for these were only the dangling\r\npalampores and variegated tatters of his gay retinue.  As there were\r\nseveral clefts in the rock from whence water seemed to have flowed,\r\nVathek applied his ear with the hope of catching the sound of some latent\r\nrunnel, but could only distinguish the low murmurs of his people, who\r\nwere repining at their journey, and complaining for the want of water.\r\n\r\n“To what purpose,” asked they, “have we been brought hither?  Hath our\r\nCaliph another tower to build? or have the relentless Afrits {67c} whom\r\nCarathis so much loves, fixed in this place their abode?”\r\n\r\nAt the name of Carathis, Vathek recollected the tablets he had received\r\nfrom his mother, who assured him they were fraught with preternatural\r\nqualities, and advised him to consult them as emergencies might require.\r\nWhilst he was engaged in turning them over, he heard a shout of joy, and\r\na loud clapping of hands.  The curtains of his pavilion were soon drawn\r\nback, and he beheld Bababalouk, followed by a troop of his favourites,\r\nconducting two dwarfs, each a cubit high, who brought between them a\r\nlarge basket of melons, oranges, and pomegranites.  They were singing in\r\nthe sweetest tones the words that follow:\r\n\r\n“We dwell on the top of these rocks, in a cabin of rushes and canes; the\r\neagles envy us our nest; a small spring supplies us with abdest, and we\r\ndaily repeat prayers which the prophet approves.  We love you, O\r\ncommander of the faithful! our master, the good emir Fakreddin, loves you\r\nalso; he reveres in your person the vicegerent of Mahomet.  Little as we\r\nare, in us he confides; he knows our hearts to be good, as our bodies are\r\ncontemptible, and hath placed us here to aid those who are bewildered on\r\nthese dreary mountains.  Last night, whilst we were occupied within our\r\ncell in reading the holy koran, a sudden hurricane blew out our lights\r\nand rocked our habitation.  For two whole hours a palpable darkness\r\nprevailed: but we heard sounds at a distance which we conjectured to\r\nproceed from the bells of a cafila, passing over the rocks.  Our ears\r\nwere soon filled with deplorable shrieks, frightful roarings, and the\r\nsound of tymbals.  Chilled with terror, we concluded that the Deggial\r\n{68} with his exterminating angels had sent forth their plagues on the\r\nearth.  In the midst of these melancholy reflections, we perceived flames\r\nof the deepest red glow in the horizon, and found ourselves in a few\r\nmoments covered with flakes of fire.  Amazed at so strange an appearance,\r\nwe took up the volume dictated by the blessed intelligence, and kneeling\r\nby the light of the fire that surrounded us, we recited the verse which\r\nsays: ‘Put no trust in any thing but the mercy of heaven; there is no\r\nhelp save in the holy prophet; the mountain of Kaf itself may tremble; it\r\nis the power of Alla only that cannot be moved.’  After having pronounced\r\nthese words, we felt consolation, and our minds were hushed into a sacred\r\nrepose.  Silence ensued, and our ears clearly distinguished a voice in\r\nthe air, saying: ‘Servants of my faithful servant, go down to the happy\r\nvalley of Fakreddin; tell him that an illustrious opportunity now offers\r\nto satiate the thirst of his hospitable heart.  The commander of true\r\nbelievers is this day bewildered amongst these mountains, and stands in\r\nneed of thy aid.’  We obeyed with joy the angelic mission, and our\r\nmaster, filled with pious zeal, hath culled with his own hands these\r\nmelons, oranges, and pomegranites.  He is following us with a hundred\r\ndromedaries laden with the purest waters of his fountains, and is coming\r\nto kiss the fringe of your consecrated robe, and implore you to enter his\r\nhumble habitation, which, placed amidst these barren wilds, resembles an\r\nemerald set in lead.”\r\n\r\nThe dwarfs having ended their address, remained still standing, and with\r\nhands crossed upon their bosoms, preserved a respectful silence.\r\n\r\nVathek, in the midst of this curious harangue seized the basket, and long\r\nbefore it was finished, the fruits had dissolved in his mouth.  As he\r\ncontinued to eat, his piety increased, and in the same breath which\r\nrecited his prayers, he called for the koran and sugar.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of his mind when the tablets, which were thrown by at\r\nthe approach of the dwarfs, again attracted his eye.  He took them up,\r\nbut was ready to drop on the ground when he beheld, in large red\r\ncharacters, these words inscribed by Carathis, which were indeed enough\r\nto make him tremble.\r\n\r\n“Beware of thy old doctors, and their puny messengers of but one cubit\r\nhigh; distrust their pious frauds; and instead of eating their melons,\r\nimpale on a spit the bearers of them.  Shouldst thou be such a fool as to\r\nvisit them, the portal of the subterranean palace will be shut in thy\r\nface, and with such force as shall shake thee asunder; thy body shall be\r\nspit upon, and bats will engender in thy belly.”\r\n\r\n“To what tends this ominous rhapsody?” cries the Caliph; “and must I then\r\nperish in these deserts with thirst, whilst I may refresh myself in the\r\nvalley of melons and cucumbers?  Accursed be the Giaour with his portal\r\nof ebony! he hath made me dance attendance too long already.  Besides,\r\nwho shall prescribe laws to me?  I, forsooth, must not enter any one’s\r\nhabitation!  Be it so, but what one can I enter that is not my own.”\r\n\r\nBababalouk, who lost not a syllable of this soliloquy, applauded it with\r\nall his heart; and the ladies, for the first time, agreed with him in\r\nopinion.  The dwarfs were entertained, caressed, and seated with great\r\nceremony on little cushions of satin.  The symmetry of their persons was\r\nthe subject of criticism; not an inch of them was suffered to pass\r\nunexamined.  Nick-nacks and dainties were offered in profusion, but all\r\nwere declined with respectful gravity.  They clambered up the sides of\r\nthe Caliph’s seat, and placing themselves each on one of his shoulders,\r\nbegan to whisper prayers in his ears.  Their tongues quivered like the\r\nleaves of a poplar, and the patience of Vathek was almost exhausted, when\r\nthe acclamations of the troops announced the approach of Fakreddin, who\r\nwas come with a hundred old grey-beards, and as many korans and\r\ndromedaries.  They instantly set about their ablutions, and began to\r\nrepeat the Bismillah.  Vathek, to get rid of these officious monitors,\r\nfollowed their example, for his hands were burning.\r\n\r\nThe good Emir, who was punctiliously religious, and likewise a great\r\ndealer in compliments, made an harangue five times more prolix and\r\ninsipid than his harbingers had already delivered.  The Caliph, unable\r\nany longer to refrain, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“For the love of Mahomet, my dear Fakreddin, have done! let us proceed to\r\nyour valley, and enjoy the fruits that heaven hath vouchsafed you.”  The\r\nhint of proceeding put all into motion.  The venerable attendants of the\r\nemir set forward somewhat slowly, but Vathek having ordered his little\r\npages, in private, to goad on the dromedaries, loud fits of laughter\r\nbroke forth from the cages, for the unwieldy curvetting of these poor\r\nbeasts, and the ridiculous distress of their superannuated riders\r\nafforded the ladies no small entertainment.\r\n\r\nThey descended, however, unhurt into the valley, by the large steps which\r\nthe emir had cut in the rock; and already the murmuring of streams and\r\nthe rustling of leaves began to catch their attention.  The cavalcade\r\nsoon entered a path, which was skirted by flowering shrubs, and extended\r\nto a vast wood of palm-trees whose branches overspread a building of hewn\r\nstone.  This edifice was crowned with nine domes, and adorned with as\r\nmany portals of bronze, on which was engraven the following inscription:\r\n\r\n“This is the asylum of pilgrims, the refuge of travellers, and the\r\ndepository of secrets for all parts of the world.”\r\n\r\nNine pages beautiful as the day, and clothed in robes of Egyptian linen,\r\nvery long and very modest, were standing at each door.  They received the\r\nwhole retinue with an easy and inviting air.  Four of the most amiable\r\nplaced the Caliph on a magnificent taktrevan; four others, somewhat less\r\ngraceful, took charge of Bababalouk, who capered for joy at the snug\r\nlittle cabin that fell to his share; the pages that remained, waited on\r\nthe rest of the train.\r\n\r\nWhen every thing masculine was gone out of sight, the gate of a large\r\ninclosure on the right turned on its harmonious hinges, and a young\r\nfemale of a slender form came forth.  Her light brown hair floated in the\r\nhazy breeze of the twilight.  A troop of young maidens, like the\r\nPleiades, attended her on tip-toe.  They hastened to the pavilions that\r\ncontained the sultanas; and the young lady gracefully bending said to\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n“Charming princesses, every thing is ready; we have prepared beds for\r\nyour repose, and strewed your apartments with jasamine; no insects will\r\nkeep off slumber from visiting your eyelids; we will dispel them with a\r\nthousand plumes.  Come then, amiable ladies! refresh your delicate feet\r\nand your ivory limbs in baths of rose water, and by the light of perfumed\r\nlamps your servants will amuse you with tales.”\r\n\r\nThe sultanas accepted with pleasure these obliging offers, and followed\r\nthe young lady to the emir’s harem, where we must for a moment leave them\r\nand return to the Caliph.\r\n\r\nVathek found himself beneath a vast dome illuminated by a thousand lamps\r\nof rock crystal, as many vases of the same material filled with excellent\r\nsherbet sparkled on a large table, where a profusion of viands were\r\nspread.  Amongst others were sweetbreads stewed in milk of almonds,\r\nsaffron soups, and lamb à la crême, of all of which the Caliph was\r\namazingly fond.  He took of each as much as he was able; testified his\r\nsense of the emir’s friendship by the gaiety of his heart; and made the\r\ndwarfs dance against their will; for these little devotees durst not\r\nrefuse the commander of the faithful.  At last he spread himself on the\r\nsofa and slept sounder than he had ever before.\r\n\r\nBeneath this dome a general silence prevailed, for there was nothing to\r\ndisturb it but the jaws of Bababalouk, who had untrussed himself to eat\r\nwith greater advantage, being anxious to make amends for his fast in the\r\nmountains.  As his spirits were too high to admit of his sleeping, and\r\nnot loving to be idle, he proposed with himself to visit the harem, and\r\nrepair to his charge of the ladies, to examine if they had been properly\r\nlubricated with the balm of Mecca, if their eye-brows and tresses were in\r\norder, and in a word, to perform all the little offices they might need.\r\nHe sought for a long time together, but without being able to find out\r\nthe door.  He durst not speak aloud for fear of disturbing the Caliph,\r\nand not a soul was stirring in the precincts of the palace.  He almost\r\ndespaired of effecting his purpose, when a low whispering just reached\r\nhis ear: it came from the dwarfs, who were returned to their old\r\noccupation, and for the nine hundred and ninety-ninth time in their lives\r\nwere reading over the koran.  They very politely invited Bababalouk to be\r\nof their party, but his head was full of other concerns.  The dwarfs,\r\nthough scandalized at his dissolute morals, directed him to the\r\napartments he wanted to find.  His way thither lay through a hundred dark\r\ncorridors, along which he groped as he went, and at last began to catch,\r\nfrom the extremity of a passage, the charming gossiping of women, which\r\nnot a little delighted his heart.\r\n\r\n“Ah, ah! what not yet asleep?” cried he, and taking long strides as he\r\nspoke, “did you not suspect me of abjuring my charge?  I stayed but to\r\nfinish what my master had left.”\r\n\r\nTwo of the black eunuchs on hearing a voice so loud detached a party in\r\nhaste, sabre in hand, to discover the cause, but presently was repeated\r\non all sides:\r\n\r\n“’Tis only Bababalouk, no one but Bababalouk!”\r\n\r\nThis circumspect guardian having gone up to a thin veil of carnation\r\ncolour silk that hung before the doorway, distinguished by means of a\r\nsoftened splendour that shone through it, an oval bath of dark porphyry\r\nsurrounded by curtains festooned in large folds.  Through the apertures\r\nbetween them, as they were not drawn close, groups of young slaves were\r\nvisible, amongst whom Bababalouk perceived his pupils indulgingly\r\nexpanding their arms, as if to embrace the perfumed water, and refresh\r\nthemselves after their fatigues.  The looks of tender languor, their\r\nconfidential whispers, and the enchanting smiles with which they were\r\nimparted, the exquisite fragrance of the roses, all combined to inspire a\r\nvoluptuousness which even Bababalouk himself was scarce able to\r\nwithstand.\r\n\r\nHe summoned up, however, his usual solemnity, and in the peremptory tone\r\nof authority commanded the ladies instantly to leave the bath.  Whilst he\r\nwas issuing these mandates, the young Nouronihar, daughter of the emir,\r\nwho was sprightly as an antelope, and full of wanton gaiety, beckoned one\r\nof her slaves to let down the great swing, which was suspended to the\r\nceiling by cords of silk, and whilst this was doing winked to her\r\ncompanions in the bath, who chagrined to be forced from so soothing a\r\nstate of indolence, began to twist it round Bababalouk, and teaze him\r\nwith a thousand vagaries.\r\n\r\nWhen Nouronihar perceived that he was exhausted with fatigue, she\r\naccosted him with an arch air of respectful concern, and said:\r\n\r\n“My lord, it is not by any means decent that the chief eunuch of the\r\nCaliph our sovereign should thus continue standing, deign but to recline\r\nyour graceful person upon this sofa, which will burst with vexation if it\r\nhave not the honour to receive you.”\r\n\r\nCaught by these flattering accents, Bababalouk gallantly replied:\r\n\r\n“Delight of the apple of my eye!  I accept the invitation of thy honied\r\nlips, and to say truth, my senses are dazzled with the radiance that\r\nbeams from thy charms.”\r\n\r\n“Repose, then, at your ease,” replied the beauty, and placed him on the\r\npretended sofa, which, quicker than lightning, gave way all at once.  The\r\nrest of the women having aptly conceived her design, sprang naked from\r\nthe bath and plied the swing with such unmerciful jerks, that it swept\r\nthrough the whole compass of a very lofty dome, and took from the poor\r\nvictim all power of respiration.  Sometimes his feet rased the surface of\r\nthe water, and at others the skylight almost flattened his nose.  In vain\r\ndid he pierce the air with the cries of a voice that resembled the\r\nringing of a cracked basin, for their peals of laughter were still more\r\npredominant.\r\n\r\nNouronihar in the inebriety of youthful spirits being used only to\r\neunuchs of ordinary harems, and having never seen any thing so royal and\r\ndisgusting, was far more diverted than all of the rest.  She began to\r\nparody some Persian verses, and sung with an accent most demurely\r\npiquant:\r\n\r\n    “O gentle white dove as thou soar’st through the air,\r\n    Vouchsafe one kind glance on the mate of thy love:\r\n    Melodious Philomel I am thy rose;\r\n    Warble some couplet to ravish my heart!”\r\n\r\nThe sultanas and their slaves stimulated by these pleasantries persevered\r\nat the swing with such unremitted assiduity, that at length the cord\r\nwhich had secured it snapped suddenly asunder, and Bababalouk fell\r\nfloundering like a turtle to the bottom of the bath.  This accident\r\noccasioned a universal shout.  Twelve little doors till now unobserved\r\nflew open at once, and the ladies in an instant made their escape, after\r\nthrowing all the towels on his head, and putting out the lights that\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nThe deplorable animal, in water to the chin, overwhelmed with darkness,\r\nand unable to extricate himself from the warp that embarrassed him, was\r\nstill doomed to hear for his further consolation, the fresh bursts of\r\nmerriment his disaster occasioned.  He bustled but in vain to get from\r\nthe bath, for the margin was become so slippery with the oil spilt in\r\nbreaking the lamps, that at every effort he slid back with a plunge,\r\nwhich resounded aloud through the hollow of the dome.  These cursed peals\r\nof laughter at every relapse were redoubled, and he, who thought the\r\nplace infested rather by devils than women, resolved to cease groping,\r\nand abide in the bath, where he amused himself with soliloquies\r\ninterspersed with imprecations, of which his malicious neighbours,\r\nreclining on down, suffered not an accent to escape.  In this delectable\r\nplight the morning surprised him.  The Caliph, wondering at his absence,\r\nhad caused him to be everywhere sought for.  At last he was drawn forth\r\nalmost smothered from the whisp of linen, and wet even to the marrow.\r\nLimping, and chattering his teeth, he appeared before his master, who\r\ninquired what was the matter, and how he came soused in so strange a\r\npickle.\r\n\r\n“And why did you enter this cursed lodge?” answered Bababalouk, gruffly.\r\n“Ought a monarch like you to visit with his harem the abode of a grey\r\nbearded emir who knows nothing of life?  And with what gracious damsels\r\ndoes the place too abound!  Fancy to yourself how they have soaked me\r\nlike a burnt crust, and made me dance like a jack-pudding the live-long\r\nnight through on their damnable swing.  What an excellent lesson for your\r\nsultanas to follow, into whom I have instilled such reserve and decorum!”\r\n\r\nVathek, comprehending not a syllable of all this invective, obliged him\r\nto relate minutely the transaction; but instead of sympathising with the\r\nmiserable sufferer, he laughed immoderately at the device of the swing,\r\nand the figure of Bababalouk mounting upon it.  The stung eunuch could\r\nscarcely preserve the semblance of respect.\r\n\r\n“Aye, laugh my lord! laugh,” said he, “but I wish this Nouronihar would\r\nplay some trick on you; she is too wicked to spare even majesty itself.”\r\n\r\nThese words made for the present but a slight impression on the Caliph,\r\nbut they not long after recurred to his mind.\r\n\r\nThis conversation was cut short by Fakreddin, who came to request that\r\nVathek would join in the prayers and ablutions to be solemnized on a\r\nspacious meadow, watered by innumerable streams.  The Caliph found the\r\nwaters refreshing, but the prayers abominably irksome.  He diverted\r\nhimself however with the multitude of Calenders, {79a} Santons, {79b} and\r\nDervises {79c} who were continually coming and going, but especially with\r\nthe Brahmins, {79d} Faquirs, {79e} and other enthusiasts, who had\r\ntravelled from the heart of India, and halted on their way with the emir.\r\nThese latter had each of them some mummery peculiar to himself.  One\r\ndragged a huge chain where ever he went, another an ourang-outang, whilst\r\na third was furnished with scourges, and all performed to a charm.  Some\r\nclambered up trees, holding one foot in the air; others poised themselves\r\nover a fire, and without mercy fillipped their noses.  There were some\r\namongst them that cherished vermin, which were not ungrateful in\r\nrequiting their caresses.  These rambling fanatics revolted the hearts of\r\nthe Dervises, the Calenders, and Santons; however the vehemence of their\r\naversion soon subsided under the hope that the presence of the Caliph\r\nwould cure their folly, and convert them to the Mussulman faith.  But\r\nalas! how great was their disappointment! for Vathek, instead of\r\npreaching to them, treated them as buffoons; bade them present his\r\ncompliments to Visnow and Ixhora, and discovered a predilection for a\r\nsquat old man from the Isle of Serendib, who was more ridiculous than any\r\nof the rest.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said he, “for the love of your gods, bestow a few slaps on your\r\nchops to amuse me.”\r\n\r\nThe old fellow offended at such an address began loudly to weep; but as\r\nhe betrayed a villainous drivelling in his tears, the Caliph turned his\r\nback and listened to Bababalouk, who whispered, whilst he held the\r\numbrella over him:\r\n\r\n“Your majesty should be cautious of this odd assembly, which hath been\r\ncollected I know not for what.  Is it necessary to exhibit such\r\nspectacles to a mighty potentate, with interludes of talapoins more mangy\r\nthan dogs?  Were I you, I would command a fire to be kindled, and at once\r\npurge the earth of the emir, his harem, and all his menagery.”\r\n\r\n“Tush, dolt,” answered Vathek, “and know that all this infinitely charms\r\nme.  Nor shall I leave the meadow till I have visited every hive of these\r\npious mendicants.”\r\n\r\nWhere ever the Caliph directed his course, objects of pity were sure to\r\nswarm round him: the blind, the purblind, smarts without noses, damsels\r\nwithout ears, each to extol the munificence of Fakreddin, who, as well as\r\nhis attendant grey-beards, dealt about gratis plasters and cataplasms to\r\nall that applied.  At noon a superb corps of cripples made its\r\nappearance; and soon after advanced by platoons on the plain the\r\ncompletest association of invalids that had ever been embodied till then.\r\nThe blind went groping with the blind; the lame limped on together; and\r\nthe maimed made gestures to each other with the only arm that remained.\r\nThe sides of a considerable waterfall were crowded by the deaf, amongst\r\nwhom were some from Pegu, with ears uncommonly handsome and large, but\r\nwere still less able to hear than the rest.  Nor were there wanting\r\nothers in abundance with hump backs, wenny necks, and even horns of an\r\nexquisite polish.\r\n\r\nThe emir, to aggrandize the solemnity of the festival in honour of his\r\nillustrious visitant, ordered the turf to be spread on all sides with\r\nskins and table cloths, upon which were served up for the good mussulmans\r\npilaus of every hue, with other orthodox dishes, and by the express order\r\nof Vathek, who was shamefully tolerant, small plates of abominations for\r\nregaling the rest.  This prince on seeing so many mouths put in motion\r\nbegan to think it time for employing his own.  In spite, therefore, of\r\nevery remonstrance from the chief of his eunuchs, he resolved to have a\r\ndinner dressed on the spot.  The complaisant emir immediately gave orders\r\nfor a table to be placed in the shade of the willows.  The first service\r\nconsisted of fish, which they drew from a river flowing over sands of\r\ngold, at the foot of a lofty hill: these were broiled as fast as taken,\r\nand served up with a sauce of vinegar and small herbs that grew on Mount\r\nSinai; for everything with the emir was excellent and pious.\r\n\r\nThe dessert was not quite set on when the sound of lutes from the hill\r\nwas repeated by the echoes of the neighbouring mountains.  The Caliph\r\nwith an emotion of pleasure and surprise, had no sooner raised up his\r\nhead than a handful of jasamine dropped on his face.  An abundance of\r\ntittering succeeded this frolic, and instantly appeared through the\r\nbushes the elegant forms of several young females, skipping and bounding\r\nlike roes.  The fragrance diffused from their hair struck the sense of\r\nVathek, who in an ecstasy, suspending his repast, said to Bababalouk:\r\n\r\n“Are the Peries {82} come down from their spheres?  Note her in\r\nparticular whose form is so perfect, venturously running on the brink of\r\nthe precipice, and turning back her head as regardless of nothing but the\r\ngraceful flow of her robe.  With what captivating impatience doth she\r\ncontend with the bushes for her veil? Could it be she who threw the\r\njasamine at me?”\r\n\r\n“Aye, she it was; and you too would she throw from the top of the rock,”\r\nanswered Bababalouk, “for that is my good friend Nouronihar, who so\r\nkindly lent me her swing.  My dear lord and master,” added he, twisting a\r\ntwig that hung by the rind from a willow, “let me correct her for her\r\nwant of respect: the emir will have no reason to complain, since (bating\r\nwhat I owe to his piety) he is much to be censured for keeping a troop of\r\ngirls on the mountains, whose sharp air gives their blood too brisk a\r\ncirculation.”\r\n\r\n“Peace, blasphemer!” said the Caliph: “speak not thus of her who over her\r\nmountains leads my heart a willing captive.  Contrive, rather, that my\r\neyes may be fixed upon hers—that I may respire her sweet breath, as she\r\nbounds panting along these delightful wilds!”\r\n\r\nOn saying these words, Vathek extended his arms towards the hill, and\r\ndirecting his eyes with an anxiety unknown to him before, endeavoured to\r\nkeep within view the object that enthralled his soul; but her course was\r\nas difficult to follow as the flight of one of those beautiful blue\r\nbutterflies of Cachmere, which are at once so volatile and rare.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph, not satisfied with seeing, wished also to hear Nouronihar,\r\nand eagerly turned to catch the sound of her voice.  At last he\r\ndistinguished her whispering to one of her companions behind the thicket\r\nfrom whence she had thrown the jasamine:\r\n\r\n“A Caliph, it must be owned, is a fine thing to see, but my little\r\nGulchenrouz is much more amiable; one lock of his hair is of more value\r\nto me than the richest embroidery of the Indies.  I had rather that his\r\nteeth should mischievously press my finger, than the richest ring of the\r\nimperial treasure.  Where have you left him, Sutlememe? and why is he now\r\nnot here?”\r\n\r\nThe agitated Caliph still wished to hear more, but she immediately\r\nretired with all her attendants.  The fond monarch pursued her with his\r\neyes till she was gone out of sight, and then continued like a bewildered\r\nand benighted traveller, from whom the clouds had obscured the\r\nconstellation that guided his way.  The curtain of night seemed dropped\r\nbefore him—everything appeared discoloured.  The falling waters filled\r\nhis soul with dejection, and his tears trickled down the jasamines he had\r\ncaught from Nouronihar, and placed in his inflamed bosom.  He snatched up\r\na shining pebble to remind him of the scene where he felt the first\r\ntumults of love.  Two hours were elapsed, and evening drew on before he\r\ncould resolve to depart from the place.  He often, but in vain, attempted\r\nto go: a soft languor enervated the powers of his mind.  Extending\r\nhimself on the brink of the stream, he turned his eyes towards the blue\r\nsummits of the mountain, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“What concealest thou behind thee? what is passing in thy solitudes?\r\nWhither is she gone?  O heaven! perhaps she is now wandering in the\r\ngrottoes with her happy Gulchenrouz!”\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the damps began to descend, and the emir, solicitous for\r\nthe health of the Caliph, ordered the imperial litter to be brought.\r\nVathek, absorbed in his reveries, was imperceptibly removed and conveyed\r\nback to the saloon that received him the evening before.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave the Caliph immersed in his new passion, and attend\r\nNouronihar beyond the rocks, where she had again joined her beloved\r\nGulchenrouz.  This Gulchenrouz was the son of Ali Hassan, brother to the\r\nemir, and the most delicate and lovely creature in the world.  Ali\r\nHassan, who had been absent ten years on a voyage to the unknown seas,\r\ncommitted at his departure this child, the only survivor of many, to the\r\ncare and protection of his brother.  Gulchenrouz could write in various\r\ncharacters with precision, and paint upon vellum the most elegant\r\narabesques that fancy could devise.  His sweet voice accompanied the lute\r\nin the most enchanting manner; and when he sung the loves of Megnoun and\r\nLeileh, or some unfortunate lovers of ancient days, tears insensibly\r\noverflowed the cheeks of his auditors.  The verses he composed (for like\r\nMegnoun, he too was a poet) inspired that unresisting languor so\r\nfrequently fatal to the female heart.  The women all doated upon him, for\r\nthough he had passed his thirteenth year, they still detained him in the\r\nharem.  His dancing was light as the gossamer waved by the zephyrs of\r\nspring; but his arms which twined so gracefully with those of the young\r\ngirls in the dance, could neither dart the lance in the chase, nor curb\r\nthe steeds that pastured his uncle’s domains.  The bow, however, he drew\r\nwith a certain aim, and would have excelled his competitors in the race,\r\ncould he have broken the ties that bound him to Nouronihar.\r\n\r\nThe two brothers had mutually engaged their children to each other; and\r\nNouronihar loved her cousin more than her eyes.  Both had the same tastes\r\nand amusements; the same long languishing looks; the same tresses; the\r\nsame fair complexions; and when Gulchenrouz appeared in the dress of his\r\ncousin, he seemed to be more feminine than even herself.  If at any time\r\nhe left the harem to visit Fakreddin, it was with all the bashfulness of\r\na fawn that consciously ventures from the lair of its dam; he was however\r\nwanton enough to mock the solemn old grey-beards to whom he was subject,\r\nthough sure to be rated without mercy in return.  Whenever this happened,\r\nhe would plunge into the recesses of the harem, and sobbing take refuge\r\nin the arms of Nouronihar, who loved even his faults beyond the virtues\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nIt fell out this evening that after leaving the Caliph in the meadow, she\r\nran with Gulchenrouz over the green sward of the mountain that sheltered\r\nthe vale, where Fakreddin had chosen to reside.  The sun was dilated on\r\nthe edge of the horizon; and the young people, whose fancies were lively\r\nand inventive, imagined they beheld in the gorgeous clouds of the west\r\nthe domes of Shadukiam and Ambreabad, where the Peries have fixed their\r\nabode.  Nouronihar, sitting on the slope of the hill, supported on her\r\nknees the perfumed head of Gulchenrouz.  The air was calm, and no sound\r\nstirred but the voices of other young girls who were drawing cool water\r\nfrom the streams below.  The unexpected arrival of the Caliph, and the\r\nsplendour that marked his appearance, had already filled with emotion the\r\nardent soul of Nouronihar.  Her vanity irresistibly prompted her to pique\r\nthe prince’s attention, and this she before took good care to effect\r\nwhilst he picked up the jasamine she had thrown upon him.  But when\r\nGulchenrouz asked after the flowers he had culled for her bosom,\r\nNouronihar was all in confusion.  She hastily kissed his forehead, arose\r\nin a flutter, and walked with unequal steps on the border of the\r\nprecipice.  Night advanced, and the pure gold of the setting sun had\r\nyielded to a sanguine red, the glow of which, like the reflection of a\r\nburning furnace, flushed Nouronihar’s animated countenance.  Gulchenrouz\r\nalarmed at the agitation of his cousin, said to her with a supplicating\r\naccent:\r\n\r\n“Let us be gone; the sky looks portentious: the tamarisks tremble more\r\nthan common; and the raw wind chills my very heart.  Come, let us be\r\ngone, ’tis a melancholy night.”\r\n\r\nThen taking hold of her hand he drew it towards the path he besought her\r\nto go.  Nouronihar unconsciously followed the attraction, for a thousand\r\nstrange imaginations occupied her spirit.  She passed the large round of\r\nhoneysuckles, her favourite resort, without ever vouchsafing it a glance,\r\nyet Gulchenrouz could not help snatching off a few shoots in his way,\r\nthough he ran as if a wild beast were behind.\r\n\r\nThe young females seeing him approach in such haste, and according to\r\ncustom expecting a dance, instantly assembled in a circle and took each\r\nother by the hand, but Gulchenrouz coming up out of breath, fell down at\r\nonce on the grass.  This accident struck with consternation the whole of\r\nthis frolicsome party, whilst Nouronihar, half distracted, and overcome\r\nboth by the violence of her exercise and the tumult of her thoughts, sunk\r\nfeebly down at his side, cherished his cold hands in her bosom, and\r\nchafed his temples with a fragrant unguent.  At length he came to\r\nhimself, and wrapping up his head in the robe of his cousin, entreated\r\nthat she would not return to the harem.  He was afraid of being snapped\r\nat by Shaban his tutor, a wrinkled old eunuch of a surly disposition, for\r\nhaving interrupted the stated walk of Nouronihar, he dreaded lest the\r\nchurl should take it amiss.  The whole of this sprightly group, sitting\r\nround upon a mossy knole, began to entertain themselves with various\r\npastimes, whilst their superintendents the eunuchs were gravely\r\nconversing at a distance.  The nurse of the emir’s daughter observing her\r\npupil sit ruminating with her eyes on the ground, endeavoured to amuse\r\nher with diverting tales, to which Gulchenrouz, who had already forgotten\r\nhis inquietudes, listened with a breathless attention.  He laughed; he\r\nclapped his hands; and passed a hundred little tricks on the whole of the\r\ncompany, without omitting the eunuchs, whom he provoked to run after him,\r\nin spite of their age and decrepitude.\r\n\r\nDuring these occurrences the moon arose, the wind subsided, and the\r\nevening became so serene and inviting that a resolution was taken to sup\r\non the spot.  Sutlememe, who excelled in dressing a salad, having filled\r\nlarge bowls of porcelain with eggs of small birds, curds turned with\r\ncitron juice, slices of cucumber, and the inmost leaves of delicate\r\nherbs, handed it round from one to another, and gave each their shares in\r\na large spoon of cocknos.  Gulchenrouz nestling as usual in the bosom of\r\nNouronihar, pouted out his vermillion little lips against the offer of\r\nSutlememe, and would take it only from the hand of his cousin, on whose\r\nmouth he hung like a bee inebriated with the quintessence of flowers.\r\nOne of the eunuchs ran to fetch melons, whilst others were employed in\r\nshowering down almonds from the branches that overhung this amiable\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this festive scene there appeared a light on the top of\r\nthe highest mountain, which attracted the notice of every eye.  This\r\nlight was not less bright than the moon when at full, and might have been\r\ntaken for her had it not been that the moon was already risen.  The\r\nphenomenon occasioned a general surprise, and no one could conjecture the\r\ncause.  It could not be a fire, for the light was clear and bluish; nor\r\nhad meteors ever been seen of that magnitude or splendour.  This strange\r\nlight faded for a moment, and immediately renewed its brightness.  It\r\nfirst appeared motionless at the foot of the rock, whence it darted in an\r\ninstant to sparkle in a thicket of palm trees, from thence it glided\r\nalong the torrent, and at last fixed in a glen that was narrow and dark.\r\nThe moment it had taken its direction, Gulchenrouz, whose heart always\r\ntrembled at any thing sudden or rare, drew Nouronihar by the robe, and\r\nanxiously requested her to return to the harem.  The women were\r\nimportunate in seconding the entreaty, but the curiosity of the emir’s\r\ndaughter prevailed.  She not only refused to go back, but resolved at all\r\nhazards to pursue the appearance.  Whilst they were debating what was\r\nbest to be done, the light shot forth so dazzling a blaze that they all\r\nfled away shrieking.  Nouronihar followed them a few steps, but coming to\r\nthe turn of a little bye path stopped, and went back alone.  As she ran\r\nwith an alertness peculiar to herself, it was not long before she came to\r\nthe place where they had just been supping.  The globe of fire now\r\nappeared stationary in the glen, and burned in majestic stillness.\r\nNouronihar compressing her hands upon her bosom, hesitated for some\r\nmoments to advance.  The solitude of her situation was new; the silence\r\nof the night awful; and every object inspired sensations which till then\r\nshe never had felt.  The affright of Gulchenrouz recurred to her mind;\r\nand she a thousand times turned to go back, but this luminous appearance\r\nwas always before her.  Urged on by an irresistible impulse, she\r\ncontinued to approach it in defiance of every obstacle that opposed her\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nAt length she arrived at the opening of the glen, but instead of coming\r\nup to the light, she found herself surrounded by darkness, except that at\r\na considerable distance a faint spark glimmered by fits.  She stopped a\r\nsecond time: the sound of waterfalls mingling their murmurs, the hollow\r\nrustlings amongst the palm branches, and the funereal screams of the\r\nbirds from their rifted trunks, all conspired to fill her with terror.\r\nShe imagined every moment that she trod on some venomous reptile.  All\r\nthe stories of malignant Dives, and dismal Goules thronged into her\r\nmemory, but her curiosity was notwithstanding more predominant than her\r\nfears.  She therefore firmly entered a winding track that led towards the\r\nspark, but being a stranger to the path, she had not gone far till she\r\nbegan to repent of her rashness.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” said she, “that I were but in those secure and illuminated\r\napartments where my evenings glided on with Gulchenrouz!  Dear child, how\r\nwould thy heart flutter with terror wert thou wandering in these wild\r\nsolitudes like me.”\r\n\r\nAt the close of this apostrophe she regained her road, and coming to\r\nsteps hewn out in the rock ascended them undismayed.  The light, which\r\nwas now gradually enlarging, appeared above her on the summit of the\r\nmountain.  At length she distinguished a plaintive and melodious union of\r\nvoices proceeding from a sort of cavern, that resembled the dirges which\r\nare sung over tombs.  A sound likewise like that which arises from the\r\nfilling of baths, at the same time struck her ear.  She continued\r\nascending, and discovered large wax torches in full blaze planted here\r\nand there in the fissures of the rock.  This preparation filled her with\r\nfear, whilst the subtle and potent odour which the torches exhaled caused\r\nher to sink almost lifeless at the entrance of the grot.\r\n\r\nCasting her eyes within in this kind of trance, she beheld a large\r\ncistern of gold filled with a water, whose vapour distilled on her face a\r\ndew of the essence of roses.  A soft symphony resounded through the grot.\r\nOn the sides of the cistern she noticed appendages of royalty; diadems\r\nand feathers of the heron, all sparkling with carbuncles.  Whilst her\r\nattention was fixed on this display of magnificence, the music ceased,\r\nand a voice instantly demanded:\r\n\r\n“For what monarch were these torches kindled, this bath prepared, and\r\nthese habiliments? which belong not only to the sovereigns of the earth,\r\nbut even to the talismanic powers!”\r\n\r\nTo which a second voice answered:\r\n\r\n“They are for the charming daughter of the emir Fakreddin.”\r\n\r\n“What,” replied the first, “for that trifler who consumes her time with a\r\ngiddy child, immersed in softness, and who at best can make but an\r\nenervated husband?”\r\n\r\n“And can she,” rejoined the other voice, “be amused with such empty\r\ntrifles, whilst the Caliph, the sovereign of the world, he who is\r\ndestined to enjoy the treasures of the preadimite sultans, a prince six\r\nfeet high, and whose eyes pervade the inmost soul of a female, is\r\ninflamed with the love of her? no, she will be wise enough to answer that\r\npassion alone that can aggrandize her glory.  No doubt she will, and\r\ndespise the puppet of her fancy; then all the riches this place contains,\r\nas well as the carbuncle of Giamschid shall be hers.”\r\n\r\n“You judge right,” returned the first voice, “and I haste to Istakar to\r\nprepare the palace of subterranean fire for the reception of the bridal\r\npair.”\r\n\r\nThe voices ceased, the torches were extinguished, the most entire\r\ndarkness succeeded, and Nouronihar recovering with a start, found herself\r\nreclined on a sofa in the harem of her father.  She clapped her hands,\r\nand immediately came together Gulchenrouz and her women, who, in despair\r\nat having lost her, had despatched eunuchs to seek her in every\r\ndirection.  Shaban appeared with the rest, and began to reprimand her\r\nwith an air of consequence:\r\n\r\n“Little impertinent,” said he, “whence got you false keys? or are you\r\nbeloved of some genius that hath given you a picklock?  I will try the\r\nextent of your power; come, to your chamber! through the two sky-lights,\r\nand expect not the company of Gulchenrouz.  Be expeditious!  I will shut\r\nyou up in the double tower.”\r\n\r\nAt these menaces Nouronihar indignantly raised her head, opened on Shaban\r\nher black eyes, which since the important dialogue of the enchanted grot\r\nwere considerably enlarged, and said:\r\n\r\n“Go, speak thus to slaves! but learn to reverence her who is born to give\r\nlaws, and subject all to her power.”\r\n\r\nShe was proceeding in the same style, but was interrupted by a sudden\r\nexclamation of,\r\n\r\n“The Caliph! the Caliph!”\r\n\r\nThe curtains at once were thrown open, and the slaves prostrate in double\r\nrows, whilst poor little Gulchenrouz hid himself beneath the elevation of\r\na sofa.  At first appeared a file of black eunuchs trailing after them\r\nlong trains of muslin embroidered with gold, and holding in their hands\r\ncensers, which dispensed as they passed the grateful perfume of the wood\r\nof aloes.  Next marched Bababalouk with a solemn strut, and tossing his\r\nhead as not over pleased at the visit.  Vathek came close after superbly\r\nrobed; his gait was unembarrassed and noble, and his presence would have\r\nengaged admiration, though he had not been the sovereign of the world.\r\nHe approached Nouronihar with a throbbing heart, and seemed enraptured at\r\nthe full effulgence of her radiant eyes, of which he had before caught\r\nbut a few glimpses; but she instantly depressed them, and her confusion\r\naugmented her beauty.\r\n\r\nBababalouk, who was a thorough adept in coincidences of this nature, and\r\nknew that the worst game should be played with the best face, immediately\r\nmade a signal for all to retire, and no sooner did he perceive beneath\r\nthe sofa the little one’s feet, than he drew him forth without ceremony,\r\nset him upon his shoulders, and lavished on him as he went off a thousand\r\nodious caresses.  Gulchenrouz cried out, and resisted till his cheeks\r\nbecame the colour of the blossom of the pomegranite, and the tears that\r\nstarted into his eyes shot forth a gleam of indignation.  He cast a\r\nsignificant glance at Nouronihar, which the Caliph noticing, asked:\r\n\r\n“Is that then your Gulchenrouz?”\r\n\r\n“Sovereign of the world,” answered she, “spare my cousin, whose innocence\r\nand gentleness deserve not your anger!”\r\n\r\n“Take comfort,” said Vathek with a smile, “he is in good hands.\r\nBababalouk is fond of children, and never goes without sweetmeats and\r\ncomfits.”\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Fakreddin was abashed; and suffered Gulchenrouz to be\r\nborne away without adding a word.  The tumult of her bosom betrayed her\r\nconfusion; and Vathek becoming still more impassioned, gave a loose to\r\nhis frenzy, which had only not subdued the last faint strugglings of\r\nreluctance, when the emir suddenly bursting in, threw his face upon the\r\nground at the feet of the Caliph, and said:\r\n\r\n“Commander of the faithful, abase not yourself to the meanness of your\r\nslave.”\r\n\r\n“No, emir,” replied Vathek, “I raise her to an equality with myself; I\r\ndeclare her my wife; and the glory of your race shall extend from one\r\ngeneration to another.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! my lord,” said Fakreddin, as he plucked off the honours of his\r\nbeard, “cut short the days of your faithful servant rather than force him\r\nto depart from his word.  Nouronihar, as her hands evince, is solemnly\r\npromised to Gulchenrouz, the son of my bother, Ali Hassan; they are\r\nunited also in heart; their faith is mutually plighted; and affiances so\r\nsacred cannot be broken.”\r\n\r\n“What, then,” replied the Caliph bluntly, “would you surrender this\r\ndivine beauty to a husband more womanish than herself?  And can you\r\nimagine that I will suffer her charms to decay in hands so inefficient\r\nand nerveless?  No! she is destined to live out her life within my\r\nembraces: such is my will: retire, and disturb not the night I devote to\r\nthe homage of her charms.”\r\n\r\nThe irritated emir drew forth his sabre, presented it to Vathek, and\r\nstretching out his neck, said in a firm tone of voice:\r\n\r\n“Strike your unhappy host my lord! he has lived long enough, since he\r\nhath seen the prophet’s vicegerent violate the rights of hospitality.”\r\n\r\nAt his uttering these words, Nouronihar unable to support any longer the\r\nconflict of her passions, sunk down in a swoon.  Vathek, both terrified\r\nfor her life, and furious at an opposition to his will, bade Fakreddin\r\nassist his daughter, and withdrew, darting his terrible look at the\r\nunfortunate emir, who suddenly fell backward bathed in a sweat, cold as\r\nthe damp of death.\r\n\r\nGulchenrouz, who had escaped from the hands of Bababalouk, and was that\r\ninstant returned, called out for help as loudly as he could, not having\r\nstrength to afford it himself.  Pale and panting, the poor child\r\nattempted to revive Nouronihar by caresses, and it happened that the\r\nthrilling warmth of his lips restored her to life.  Fakreddin beginning\r\nalso to recover from the look of the Caliph, with difficulty tottered to\r\na seat, and after warily casting round his eye to see if this dangerous\r\nprince were gone, sent for Shaban and Sutlememe, and said to them apart—\r\n\r\n“My friends, violent evils require as violent remedies; the Caliph has\r\nbrought desolation and horror into my family, and how shall we resist his\r\npower?  Another of his looks will send me to my grave.  Fetch then that\r\nnarcotic powder which the Dervise brought me from Aracan.  A dose of it,\r\nthe effect of which will continue three days, must be administered to\r\neach of these children.  The Caliph will believe them to be dead, for\r\nthey will have all the appearance of death.  We shall go as if to inter\r\nthem in the cave of Meimoune, at the entrance of the great desert of\r\nsand, and near the cabin of my dwarfs.  When all the spectators shall be\r\nwithdrawn, you, Shaban, and four select eunuchs shall convey them to the\r\nlake, where provision shall be ready to support them a month; for, one\r\nday allotted to the surprise this event will occasion, five to the tears,\r\na fortnight to reflection, and the rest to prepare for renewing his\r\nprogress, will, according to my calculation, fill up the whole time that\r\nVathek will tarry, and I shall then be freed from his intrusion.”\r\n\r\n“Your plan,” said Sutlememe, “is a good one, if it can but be effected.\r\nI have remarked that Nouronihar is well able to support the glances of\r\nthe Caliph, and that he is far from being sparing of them to her; be\r\nassured therefore, notwithstanding her fondness for Gulchenrouz, she will\r\nnever remain quiet while she knows him to be here, unless we can persuade\r\nher that both herself and Gulchenrouz are really dead, and that they were\r\nconveyed to those rocks for a limited season to expiate the little faults\r\nof which their love was the cause.  We will add that we killed ourselves\r\nin despair, and that your dwarfs whom they never yet saw will preach to\r\nthem delectable sermons.  I will engage that every thing shall succeed to\r\nthe bent of your wishes.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so,” said Fakreddin; “I approve your proposal; let us lose not a\r\nmoment to give it effect.”  They forthwith hastened to seek for the\r\npowder, which being mixed in a sherbet was immediately drunk by\r\nGulchenrouz and Nouronihar.  Within the space of an hour both were seized\r\nwith violent palpitations, and a general numbness gradually ensued.  They\r\narose from the floor, where they had remained ever since the Caliph’s\r\ndeparture, and ascending to the sofa, reclined themselves at full length\r\nupon it, clasped in each other’s embraces.\r\n\r\n“Cherish me, my dear Nouronihar,” said Gulchenrouz; “put thy hand upon my\r\nheart, for it feels as if it were frozen.  Alas! thou art as cold as\r\nmyself! hath the Caliph murdered us both with his terrible look?”\r\n\r\n“I am dying,” cried she in a faltering voice; “press me closer, I am\r\nready to expire!”\r\n\r\n“Let us die then together,” answered the little Gulchenrouz, whilst his\r\nbreast laboured with a convulsive sigh; “let me at least breathe forth my\r\nsoul on thy lips.”\r\n\r\nThey spoke no more, and became as dead.\r\n\r\nImmediately the most piercing cries were heard through the harem, whilst\r\nShaban and Sutlememe personated with great adroitness the parts of\r\npersons in despair.  The emir, who was sufficiently mortified to be\r\nforced into such untoward expedients, and had now for the first time made\r\na trial of his powder, was under no necessity of counterfeiting grief.\r\nThe slaves, who had flocked together from all quarters, stood motionless\r\nat the spectacle before them.  All lights were extinguished save two\r\nlamps, which shed a wan glimmering over the faces of these lovely\r\nflowers, that seemed to be faded in the spring-time of life.  Funeral\r\nvestments were prepared; their bodies were washed with rose water; their\r\nbeautiful tresses were braided and incensed; and they were wrapped in\r\nsymars whiter than alabaster.  At the moment that their attendants were\r\nplacing two wreaths of their favourite jasamines on their brows, the\r\nCaliph, who had just heard the tragical catastrophe, arrived.  He looked\r\nnot less pale and haggard than the goules that wander at night among\r\ngraves.  Forgetful of himself and every one else, he broke through the\r\nmidst of the slaves, fell prostrate at the foot of the sofa, beat his\r\nbosom, called himself “atrocious murderer,” and invoked upon his head a\r\nthousand imprecations.  With a trembling hand he raised the veil that\r\ncovered the countenance of Nouronihar, and uttering a loud shriek fell\r\nlifeless on the floor.  The chief of the eunuchs dragged him off with\r\nhorrible grimaces, and repeated as he went:\r\n\r\n“Aye, I foresaw she would play you some ungracious turn.”\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the Caliph gone than the emir commanded biers to be\r\nbrought, and forbade that any one should enter the harem.  Every window\r\nwas fastened; all instruments of music were broken; and the Imams began\r\nto recite their prayers.  Towards the close of this melancholy day Vathek\r\nsobbed in silence, for they had been forced to compose with anodynes his\r\nconvulsions of rage and desperation.\r\n\r\nAt the dawn of the succeeding morning the wide folding doors of the\r\npalace were set open, and the funeral procession moved forward for the\r\nmountain.  The wailful cries of “La Ilah illa Alla,” reached to the\r\nCaliph, who was eager to cicatrize himself and attend the ceremonial; nor\r\ncould he have been dissuaded, had not his excessive weakness disabled him\r\nfrom walking.  At the few first steps he fell on the ground, and his\r\npeople were obliged to lay him on a bed, where he remained many days in\r\nsuch a state of insensibility as excited compassion in the emir himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the procession was arrived at the grot of Meimoune, Shaban and\r\nSutlememe dismissed the whole of the train excepting the four\r\nconfidential eunuchs who were appointed to remain.  After resting some\r\nmoments near the biers which had been left in the open air, they caused\r\nthem to be carried to the brink of a small lake whose banks were\r\novergrown with a hoary moss.  This was the great resort of herons and\r\nstorks, which preyed continually on little blue fishes.  The dwarfs,\r\ninstructed by the emir, soon repaired thither, and with the help of the\r\neunuchs began to construct cabins of rushes and reeds, a work in which\r\nthey had admirable skill.  A magazine also was contrived for provisions,\r\nwith a small oratory for themselves, and a pyramid of wood neatly piled,\r\nto furnish the necessary fuel, for the air was bleak in the hollows of\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\nAt evening two fires were kindled on the brink of the lake, and the two\r\nlovely bodies taken from their biers were carefully deposited upon a bed\r\nof dried leaves within the same cabin.  The dwarfs began to recite the\r\nkoran with their clear shrill voices, and Shaban and Sutlememe stood at\r\nsome distance anxiously waiting the effects of the powder.  At length\r\nNouronihar and Gulchenrouz faintly stretched out their arms, and\r\ngradually opening their eyes began to survey with looks of increasing\r\namazement every object around them.  They even attempted to rise, but for\r\nwant of strength fell back again.  Sutlememe on this administered a\r\ncordial which the emir had taken care to provide.\r\n\r\nGulchenrouz thoroughly aroused sneezed out aloud, and raising himself\r\nwith an effort that expressed his surprise, left the cabin, and inhaled\r\nthe fresh air with the greatest avidity.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said he, “I breathe again! again do I exist!  I hear sounds!  I\r\nbehold a firmament spangled over with stars!”\r\n\r\nNouronihar catching these beloved accents extricated herself from the\r\nleaves, and ran to clasp Gulchenrouz to her bosom.  The first objects she\r\nremarked were their long symars, their garlands of flowers, and their\r\nnaked feet: she hid her face in her hands to reflect.  The vision of the\r\nenchanted bath, the despair of her father, and more vividly than both,\r\nthe majestic figure of Vathek recurred to her memory.  She recollected\r\nalso, that herself and Gulchenrouz had been sick and dying; but all these\r\nimages bewildered her mind.  Not knowing where she was, she turned her\r\neyes on all sides, as if to recognise the surrounding scene.  This\r\nsingular lake, those flames reflected from its glassy surface, the pale\r\nhues of its banks, the romantic cabins, the bull-rushes that sadly waved\r\ntheir drooping heads, the storks whose melancholy cries blended with the\r\nshrill voices of the dwarfs, every thing conspired to persuade them that\r\nthe angel of death had opened the portal of some other world.\r\n\r\nGulchenrouz on his part, lost in wonder, clung to the neck of his cousin.\r\nHe believed himself in the region of phantoms, and was terrified at the\r\nsilence she preserved.  At length addressing her:\r\n\r\n“Speak,” said he; “where are we! do you not see those spectres that are\r\nstirring the burning coals?  Are they the Monker and Nakir, come to throw\r\nus into them?  Does the fatal bridge cross this lake, whose solemn\r\nstillness perhaps conceals from us an abyss, in which for whole ages we\r\nshall be doomed incessantly to sink?”\r\n\r\n“No my children,” said Sutlememe going towards them; “take comfort, the\r\nexterminating angel who conducted our souls hither after yours, hath\r\nassured us that the chastisement of your indolent and voluptuous life\r\nshall be restricted to a certain series of years, which you must pass in\r\nthis dreary abode, where the sun is scarcely visible, and where the soil\r\nyields neither fruits nor flowers.  These,” continued she, pointing to\r\nthe dwarfs, “will provide for our wants; for souls so mundane as ours\r\nretain too strong a tincture of their earthly extraction.  Instead of\r\nmeats, your food will be nothing but rice, and your bread shall be\r\nmoistened in the fogs that brood over the surface of the lake.”\r\n\r\nAt this desolating prospect the poor children burst into tears, and\r\nprostrated themselves before the dwarfs, who perfectly supported their\r\ncharacters, and delivered an excellent discourse of a customary length\r\nupon the sacred camel, which after a thousand years was to convey them to\r\nthe paradise of the faithful.\r\n\r\nThe sermon being ended and ablutions performed, they praised Alla and the\r\nprophet, supped very indifferently, and retired to their withered leaves.\r\nNouronihar and her little cousin consoled themselves on finding that,\r\nthough dead, they yet lay in one cabin.  Having slept well before, the\r\nremainder of the night was spent in conversation on what had befallen\r\nthem; and both, from a dread of apparitions, betook themselves for\r\nprotection to one another’s arms.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, which was lowering and rainy, the dwarfs mounted high\r\npoles like minarets, and called them to prayers.  The whole congregation,\r\nwhich consisted of Sutlememe, Shaban, the four eunuchs, and some storks,\r\nwere already assembled.  The two children came forth from their cabin\r\nwith a slow and dejected pace.  As their minds were in a tender and\r\nmelancholy mood, their devotions were performed with fervour.  No sooner\r\nwere they finished than Gulchenrouz demanded of Sutlememe and the rest,\r\n“how they happened to die so opportunely for his cousin and himself.”\r\n\r\n“We killed ourselves,” returned Sutlememe, “in despair at your death.”\r\n\r\nOn this, said Nouronihar, who notwithstanding what was past, had not yet\r\nforgotten her vision:\r\n\r\n“And the Caliph, is he also dead of his grief? and will he likewise come\r\nhither?”\r\n\r\nThe dwarfs, who were prepared with an answer, most demurely replied:\r\n\r\n“Vathek is damned beyond all redemption!”\r\n\r\n“I readily believe so,” said Gulchenrouz; “and am glad from my heart to\r\nhear it, for I am convinced it was his horrible look that sent us hither,\r\nto listen to sermons and mess upon rice.”\r\n\r\nOne week passed away on the side of the lake unmarked by any variety;\r\nNouronihar ruminating on the grandeur of which death had deprived her,\r\nand Gulchenrouz applying to prayers and to panniers along with the\r\ndwarfs, who infinitely pleased him.  Whilst this scene of innocence was\r\nexhibiting in the mountains, the Caliph presented himself to the emir in\r\na new light.  The instant he recovered the use of his senses, with a\r\nvoice that made Bababalouk quake, he thundered out:\r\n\r\n“Perfidious Giaour! I renounce thee for ever! it is thou who hast slain\r\nmy beloved Nouronihar! and I supplicate the pardon of Mahomet, who would\r\nhave preserved her to me had I been more wise.  Let water be brought to\r\nperform my ablutions, and let the pious Fakreddin be called to offer up\r\nhis prayers with mine, and reconcile me to him.  Afterwards we will go\r\ntogether and visit the sepulchre of the unfortunate Nouronihar.  I am\r\nresolved to become a hermit, and consume the residue of my days on this\r\nmountain, in hope of expiating my crimes.”\r\n\r\nNouronihar was not altogether so content, for though she felt a fondness\r\nfor Gulchenrouz, who to augment the attachment, had been left at full\r\nliberty with her, yet she still regarded him as but a bauble that bore no\r\ncompetition with the carbuncle of Giamschid.  At times she indulged\r\ndoubts on the mode of her being, and scarcely could believe that the dead\r\nhad all the wants and the whims of the living.  To gain satisfaction,\r\nhowever, on so perplexing a topic, she arose one morning whilst all were\r\nasleep with a breathless caution from the side of Gulchenrouz, and after\r\nhaving given him a soft kiss, began to follow the windings of the lake\r\ntill it terminated with a rock whose top was accessible though lofty.\r\nThis she clambered up with considerable toil, and having reached the\r\nsummit, set forward in a run like a doe that unwittingly follows her\r\nhunter.  Though she skipped along with the alertness of an antelope, yet\r\nat intervals she was forced to desist, and rest beneath the tamarisks to\r\nrecover her breath.  Whilst she, thus reclined, was occupied with her\r\nlittle reflections on the apprehension that she had some knowledge of the\r\nplace, Vathek, who finding himself that morning but ill at ease, had gone\r\nforth before the dawn, presented himself on a sudden to her view.\r\nMotionless with surprise, he durst not approach the figure before him,\r\nwhich lay shrouded up in a symar extended on the ground, trembling and\r\npale, but yet lovely to behold.  At length Nouronihar, with a mixture of\r\npleasure and affliction, raising her fine eyes to him, said:\r\n\r\n“My lord, are you come hither to eat rice and hear sermons with me?”\r\n\r\n“Beloved phantom!” cried Vathek, “dost thou speak? hast thou the same\r\ngraceful form? the same radiant features? art thou palpable likewise?”\r\nand eagerly embracing her he added, “here are limbs and a bosom animated\r\nwith a gentle warmth! what can such a prodigy mean?”\r\n\r\nNouronihar with diffidence answered:\r\n\r\n“You know my lord that I died on the night you honoured me with your\r\nvisit; my cousin maintains it was from one of your glances, but I cannot\r\nbelieve him, for to me they seem not so dreadful.  Gulchenrouz died with\r\nme, and we were both brought into a region of desolation, where we are\r\nfed with a wretched diet.  If you be dead also, and are come hither to\r\njoin us, I pity your lot, for you will be stunned with the clang of the\r\ndwarfs and the storks.  Besides, it is mortifying in the extreme that you\r\nas well as myself should have lost the treasures of the subterranean\r\npalace.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of the subterranean palace, the Caliph suspended his\r\ncaresses, which indeed had proceeded pretty far, to seek from Nouronihar\r\nan explanation of her meaning.  She then recapitulated her vision—what\r\nimmediately followed—and the history of her pretended death; adding also\r\na description of the palace of expiation from whence she had fled; and\r\nall in a manner that would have extorted his laughter, had not the\r\nthoughts of Vathek been too deeply engaged.  No sooner, however, had she\r\nended, than he again clasped her to his bosom, and said:\r\n\r\n“Light of my eyes! the mystery is unravelled; we both are alive!  Your\r\nfather is a cheat, who for the sake of dividing hath deluded us both; and\r\nthe Giaour, whose design, as far as I can discover, is that we shall\r\nproceed together, seems scarce a whit better.  It shall be some time at\r\nleast before he find us in his palace of fire.  Your lovely little person\r\nin my estimation is far more precious than all the treasures of the\r\npreadimite sultans, and I wish to possess it at pleasure, and in open day\r\nfor many a moon, before I go to burrow under ground like a mole.”\r\n\r\n“Forget this little trifler Gulchenrouz, and”—\r\n\r\n“Ah, my lord,” interposed Nouronihar, “let me entreat that you do him no\r\nevil.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” replied Vathek, “I have already bid you forbear to alarm\r\nyourself for him.  He has been brought up too much on milk and sugar to\r\nstimulate my jealousy.  We will leave him with the dwarfs, who by the bye\r\nare my old acquaintances; their company will suit him far better than\r\nyours.  As to other matters, I will return no more to your father’s.  I\r\nwant not to have my ears dinned by him and his dotards with the violation\r\nof the rights of hospitality; as if it were less an honour for you to\r\nespouse the sovereign of the world, than a girl dressed up like a boy.”\r\n\r\nNouronihar could find nothing to oppose in a discourse so eloquent.  She\r\nonly wished the amorous monarch had discovered more ardour for the\r\ncarbuncle of Giamschid; but flattered herself it would gradually\r\nincrease, and therefore yielded to his will with the most bewitching\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\nWhen the Caliph judged it proper he called for Bababalouk, who was asleep\r\nin the cave of Meimoune, and dreaming that the phantom of Nouronihar\r\nhaving mounted him once more on her swing, had just given him such a jerk\r\nthat he one moment soared above the mountains, and the next sunk into the\r\nabyss.  Starting from his sleep at the voice of his master, he ran\r\ngasping for breath, and had nearly fallen backward at the sight, as he\r\nbelieved, of the spectre, by whom he had so lately been haunted in his\r\ndream.\r\n\r\n“Ah my lord,” cried he, recoiling ten steps, and covering his eyes with\r\nboth hands, “do you then perform the office of a goule?  ’Tis true you\r\nhave dug up the dead, yet hope not to make her your prey; for after all\r\nshe hath caused me to suffer, she is even wicked enough to prey upon\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Cease thy folly,” said Vathek, “and thou shalt soon be convinced that it\r\nis Nouronihar herself, alive and well, whom I clasp to my breast.  Go\r\nonly, and pitch my tents in the neighbouring valley.  There will I fix my\r\nabode with this beautiful tulip, whose colours I soon shall restore.\r\nThere exert thy best endeavours to procure whatever can augment the\r\nenjoyments of life, till I shall disclose to thee more of my will.”\r\n\r\nThe news of so unlucky an event soon reached the ears of the emir, who\r\nabandoned himself to grief and despair, and began, as did all his old\r\ngreybeards, to begrime his visage with ashes.  A total supineness ensued;\r\ntravellers were no longer entertained, no more plasters were spread, and\r\ninstead of the charitable activity that had distinguished this asylum,\r\nthe whole of its inhabitants exhibited only faces of a half cubit long,\r\nand uttered groans that accorded with their forlorn situation.\r\n\r\nThough Fakreddin bewailed his daughter as lost to him for ever, yet\r\nGulchenrouz was not forgotten.  He despatched immediate instruction to\r\nSutlememe, Shaban, and the dwarfs, enjoining them not to undeceive the\r\nchild in respect to his state, but under some pretence to convey him far\r\nfrom the lofty rock at the extremity of the lake, to a place which he\r\nshould appoint, as safer from danger; for he suspected that Vathek\r\nintended him evil.\r\n\r\nGulchenrouz in the mean while was filled with amazement at not finding\r\nhis cousin; nor were the dwarfs at all less surprised; but Sutlememe, who\r\nhad more penetration, immediately guessed what had happened.  Gulchenrouz\r\nwas amused with the delusive hope of once more embracing Nouronihar in\r\nthe interior recesses of the mountains, where the ground, strewed over\r\nwith orange blossoms and jasamines, offered beds much more inviting than\r\nthe withered leaves in their cabin, where they might accompany with their\r\nvoices the sounds of their lutes, and chase butterflies in concert.\r\nSutlememe was far gone in this sort of description when one of the four\r\neunuchs beckoned her aside to apprise her of the arrival of a messenger\r\nfrom their fraternity, who had explained the secret of the flight of\r\nNouronihar, and brought the commands of the emir.  A council with Shaban\r\nand the dwarfs was immediately held.  Their baggage being stowed in\r\nconsequence of it, they embarked in a shallop and quietly sailed with the\r\nlittle one, who acquiesced in all their proposals.  Their voyage\r\nproceeded in the same manner, till they came to the place where the lake\r\nsinks beneath the hollow of the rock, but as soon as the bark had entered\r\nit, and Gulchenrouz found himself surrounded with darkness, he was seized\r\nwith a dreadful consternation, and incessantly uttered the most piercing\r\noutcries; for he now was persuaded he should actually be damned for\r\nhaving taken too many little freedoms in his life-time with his cousin.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the Caliph, and her who ruled over his heart.\r\nBababalouk had pitched the tents, and closed up the extremities of the\r\nvalley with magnificent screens of India cloth, which were guarded by\r\nEthiopian slaves with their drawn sabres.  To preserve the verdure of\r\nthis beautiful enclosure in its natural freshness, the white eunuchs went\r\ncontinually round it with their red water vessels.  The waving of fans\r\nwas heard near the imperial pavilion, where by the voluptuous light that\r\nglowed through the muslins, the Caliph enjoyed at full view all the\r\nattractions of Nouronihar.  Inebriated with delight, he was all ear to\r\nher charming voice which accompanied the lute; while she was not less\r\ncaptivated with his descriptions of Samarah and the tower full of\r\nwonders, but especially with his relation of the adventure of the ball,\r\nand the chasm of the Giaour with its ebony portal.\r\n\r\nIn this manner they conversed for a day and a night; they bathed together\r\nin a basin of black marble, which admirably relieved the fairness of\r\nNouronihar.  Bababalouk, whose good graces this beauty had regained,\r\nspared no attention that their repasts might be served up with the\r\nminutest exactness: some exquisite rariety was ever placed before them;\r\nand he sent even to Schiraz for that fragrant and delicious wine which\r\nhad been hoarded up in bottles prior to the birth of Mahomet.  He had\r\nexcavated little ovens in the rock to bake the nice manchets which were\r\nprepared by the hands of Nouronihar, from whence they had derived a\r\nflavour so grateful to Vathek, that he regarded the ragouts of his other\r\nwives as entirely maukish; whilst they would have died at the emir’s of\r\nchagrin at finding themselves so neglected, if Fakreddin, notwithstanding\r\nhis resentment, had not taken pity upon them.\r\n\r\nThe sultana Dilara, who till then had been the favourite, took this\r\ndereliction of the Caliph to heart with a vehemence natural to her\r\ncharacter; for during her continuance in favour she had imbibed from\r\nVathek many of his extravagant fancies, and was fired with impatience to\r\nbehold the superb tombs of Istakar, and the palace of forty columns;\r\nbesides, having been brought up amongst the magi, she had fondly\r\ncherished the idea of the Caliph’s devoting himself to the worship of\r\nfire; thus his voluptuous and desultory life with her rival was to her a\r\ndouble source of affliction.  The transient piety of Vathek had\r\noccasioned her some serious alarms, but the present was an evil of far\r\ngreater magnitude.  She resolved therefore without hesitation to write to\r\nCarathis, and acquaint her that all things went ill; that they had eaten,\r\nslept, and revelled at an old emir’s, whose sanctity was very formidable,\r\nand that after all the prospect of possessing the treasures of the\r\npreadimite sultans was no less remote than before.  This letter was\r\nentrusted to the care of two woodmen who were at work on one of the great\r\nforests of the mountains, and being acquainted with the shortest cuts,\r\narrived in ten days at Samarah.\r\n\r\nThe princess Carathis was engaged at chess with Morakanabad, when the\r\narrival of these wood-fellers was announced.  She, after some weeks of\r\nVathek’s absence, had forsaken the upper regions of her tower, because\r\neverything appeared in confusion among the stars, whom she consulted\r\nrelative to the fate of her son.  In vain did she renew her fumigations,\r\nand extend herself on the roof to obtain mystic visions, nothing more\r\ncould she see in her dreams than pieces of brocade, nosegays of flowers,\r\nand other unmeaning gewgaws.  These disappointments had thrown her into a\r\nstate of dejection which no drug in her power was sufficient to remove.\r\nHer only resource was in Morakanabad, who was a good man, and endowed\r\nwith a decent share of confidence, yet whilst in her company he never\r\nthought himself on roses.\r\n\r\nNo person knew aught of Vathek, and a thousand ridiculous stories were\r\npropagated at his expense.  The eagerness of Carathis may be easily\r\nguessed at receiving the letter, as well as her rage at reading the\r\ndissolute conduct of her son.\r\n\r\n“Is it so,” said she; “either I will perish, or Vathek shall enter the\r\npalace of fire.  Let me expire in flames, provided he may reign on the\r\nthrone of Soliman!”\r\n\r\nHaving said this, and whirled herself round in a magical manner, which\r\nstruck Morakanabad with such terror as caused him to recoil, she ordered\r\nher great camel Alboufaki to be brought, and the hideous Nerkes with the\r\nunrelenting Cafour to attend.\r\n\r\n“I require no other retinue,” said she to Morakanabad: “I am going on\r\naffairs of emergency, a truce therefore to parade!  Take you care of the\r\npeople, fleece them well in my absence, for we shall expend large sums,\r\nand one knows not what may betide.”\r\n\r\nThe night was uncommonly dark, and a pestilential blast ravaged the plain\r\nof Catoul that would have deterred any other traveller however urgent the\r\ncall; but Carathis enjoyed most whatever filled others with dread.\r\nNerkes concurred in opinion with her, and Cafour had a particular\r\npredilection for a pestilence.  In the morning this accomplished caravan,\r\nwith the wood-fellers who directed their route, halted on the edge of an\r\nextensive marsh, from whence so noxious a vapour arose as would have\r\ndestroyed any animal but Alboufaki, who naturally inhaled these malignant\r\nfogs.  The peasants entreated their convoy not to sleep in this place.\r\n\r\n“To sleep,” cried Carathis, “what an excellent thought!  I never sleep\r\nbut for visions; and as to my attendants, their occupations are too many\r\nto close the only eye they each have.”\r\n\r\nThe poor peasants, who were not over pleased with their party, remained\r\nopen-mouthed with surprise.\r\n\r\nCarathis alighted as well as her negresses, and severally stripping off\r\ntheir outer garments, they all ran in their drawers to cull from those\r\nspots where the sun shone fiercest, the venomous plants that grew on the\r\nmarsh.  This provision was made for the family of the emir, and whoever\r\nmight retard the expedition to Istakar.  The woodmen were overcome with\r\nfear when they beheld these three horrible phantoms run, and not much\r\nrelishing the company of Alboufaki, stood aghast at the command of\r\nCarathis to set forward, notwithstanding it was noon, and the heat fierce\r\nenough to calcine even rocks.  In spite, however, of every remonstrance,\r\nthey were forced implicitly to submit.\r\n\r\nAlboufaki, who delighted in solitude, constantly snorted whenever he\r\nperceived himself near a habitation, and Carathis, who was apt to spoil\r\nhim with indulgence, as constantly turned him aside; so that the peasants\r\nwere precluded from procuring subsistence; for the milch goats and ewes\r\nwhich Providence had sent towards the district they traversed, to refresh\r\ntravellers with their milk, all fled at the sight of the hideous animal\r\nand his strange riders.  As to Carathis, she needed no common aliment;\r\nfor her invention had previously furnished her with an opiate to stay her\r\nstomach, some of which she imparted to her mutes.\r\n\r\nAt the fall of night Alboufaki making a sudden stop, stamped with his\r\nfoot, which to Carathis, who understood his paces, was a certain\r\nindication that she was near the confines of some cemetery.  The moon\r\nshed a bright light on the spot, which served to discover a long wall\r\nwith a large door in it standing a-jar, and so high that Alboufaki might\r\neasily enter.  The miserable guides, who perceived their end approaching,\r\nhumbly implored Carathis, as she had now so good an opportunity, to inter\r\nthem, and immediately gave up the ghost.  Nerkes and Cafour, whose wit\r\nwas of a style peculiar to themselves, were by no means parsimonious of\r\nit on the folly of these poor people, nor could any thing have been found\r\nmore suited to their taste than the site of the burying ground, and the\r\nsepulchres which its precincts contained.  There were at least two\r\nthousand of them on the declivity of a hill; some in the form of\r\npyramids, others like columns, and in short the variety of their shapes\r\nwas endless.  Carathis was too much immersed in her sublime\r\ncontemplations to stop at the view, charming as it appeared in her eyes.\r\nPondering the advantages that might accrue from her present situation,\r\nshe could not forbear to exclaim:\r\n\r\n“So beautiful a cemetery must be haunted by Gouls, and they want not for\r\nintelligence! having heedlessly suffered my guides to expire, I will\r\napply for directions to them, and as an inducement, will invite them to\r\nregale on these fresh corpses.”\r\n\r\nAfter this short soliloquy, she beckoned to Nerkes and Cafour, and made\r\nsigns with her fingers, as much as to say:\r\n\r\n“Go, knock against the sides of the tombs, and strike up your delightful\r\nwarblings, that are so like to those of the guests whose company I wish\r\nto obtain.”\r\n\r\nThe negresses, full of joy at the behests of their mistress, and\r\npromising themselves much pleasure from the society of the Gouls, went\r\nwith an air of conquest, and began their knockings at the tombs.  As\r\ntheir strokes were repeated, a hollow noise was heard in the earth, the\r\nsurface hove up into heaps, and the Gouls on all sides protruded their\r\nnoses to inhale the effluvia which the carcasses of the woodmen began to\r\nemit.\r\n\r\nThey assembled before a sarcophagus of white marble, where Carathis was\r\nseated between the bodies of her miserable guides.  The princess received\r\nher visitants with distinguished politeness, and when supper was ended,\r\nproceeded with them to business.  Having soon learnt from them every\r\nthing she wished to discover, it was her intention to set forward\r\nforthwith on her journey, but her negresses, who were forming tender\r\nconnections with the Gouls, importuned her with all their fingers to\r\nwait, at least till the dawn.  Carathis, however, being chastity in the\r\nabstract, and an implacable enemy to love and repose, at once rejected\r\ntheir prayer, mounted Alboufaki, and commanded them to take their seats\r\nin a moment.  Four days and four nights she continued her route, without\r\nturning to the right hand or left; on the fifth she traversed the\r\nmountains and half-burnt forests, and arrived on the sixth before the\r\nbeautiful screens which concealed from all eyes the voluptuous wanderings\r\nof her son.\r\n\r\nIt was day-break, and the guards were snoring on their posts in careless\r\nsecurity, when the rough trot of Alboufaki awoke them in consternation.\r\nImagining that a group of spectres ascended from the abyss was\r\napproaching, they all without ceremony took to their heels.  Vathek was\r\nat that instant with Nouronihar in the bath, hearing tales and laughing\r\nat Bababalouk who related them; but no sooner did the outcry of his\r\nguards reach him, than he flounced from the water like a carp, and as\r\nsoon threw himself back at the sight of Carathis, who advancing with her\r\nnegresses upon Alboufaki, broke through the muslin awnings and veils of\r\nthe pavilion.  At this sudden apparition Nouronihar (for she was not at\r\nall times free from remorse) fancied that the moment of celestial\r\nvengeance was come, and clung about the Caliph in amorous despondence.\r\n\r\nCarathis, still seated on her camel, foamed with indignation at the\r\nspectacle which obtruded itself on her chaste view.  She thundered forth\r\nwithout check or mercy:\r\n\r\n“Thou double-headed and four legged monster! what means all this winding\r\nand writhing? art thou not ashamed to be seen grasping this limber\r\nsapling, in preference to the sceptre of the preadimite sultans?  Is it\r\nthen for this paltry doxy that thou hast violated the conditions in the\r\nparchment of our Giaour?  Is it on her thou hast lavished thy precious\r\nmoments?  Is this the fruit of the knowledge I have taught thee?  Is this\r\nthe end of thy journey?  Tear thyself from the arms of this little\r\nsimpleton; drown her in the water before me, and instantly follow my\r\nguidance.”\r\n\r\nIn the first ebullition of his fury, Vathek resolved to make a skeleton\r\nof Alboufaki, and to stuff the skins of Carathis and her blacks; but the\r\nideas of the Giaour, the palace of Istakar, the sabres, and the\r\ntalismans, flashing before his imagination with the simultaneousness of\r\nlightning, he became more moderate, and said to his mother in a civil but\r\ndecisive tone:\r\n\r\n“Dread lady, you shall be obeyed; but I will not drown Nouronihar; she is\r\nsweeter to me than a Myrabolan comfit, and is enamoured of carbuncles,\r\nespecially that of Giamschid, which hath also been promised to be\r\nconferred upon her; she therefore shall go along with us, for I intend to\r\nrepose with her beneath the canopies of Soliman; I can sleep no more\r\nwithout her.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so,” replied Carathis alighting, and at the same time committing\r\nAlboufaki to the charge of her women.\r\n\r\nNouronihar, who had not yet quitted her hold, began to take courage, and\r\nsaid with an accent of fondness to the Caliph:\r\n\r\n“Dear sovereign of my soul!  I will follow thee, if it be thy will beyond\r\nthe Kaf, in the land of the Afrits.  I will not hesitate to climb for\r\nthee the nest of the Simurgh, who, this lady excepted, is the most awful\r\nof created existences.”\r\n\r\n“We have here then,” subjoined Carathis, “a girl both of courage and\r\nscience.”\r\n\r\nNouronihar had certainly both; but notwithstanding all her firmness, she\r\ncould not help casting back a look of regret upon the graces of her\r\nlittle Gulchenrouz, and the days of tenderness she had participated with\r\nhim.  She even dropped a few tears, which Carathis observed, and\r\ninadvertently breathed out with a sigh:\r\n\r\n“Alas! my gentle cousin, what will become of him!”\r\n\r\nVathek at this apostrophe knitted up his brows, and Carathis enquired\r\nwhat it could mean.\r\n\r\n“She is preposterously sighing after a stripling with languishing eyes\r\nand soft hair who loves her,” said the Caliph.\r\n\r\n“Where is he?” asked Carathis.  “I must be acquainted with this pretty\r\nchild; for,” added she, lowering her voice, “I design before I depart to\r\nregain the favour of the Giaour.  There is nothing so delicious in his\r\nestimation as the heart of a delicate boy, palpitating with the first\r\ntumults of love.”\r\n\r\nVathek as he came from the bath commanded Bababalouk to collect the women\r\nand other moveables of his harem, embody his troops, and hold himself in\r\nreadiness to march in three days; whilst Carathis retired alone to a\r\ntent, where the Giaour solaced her with encouraging visions; but at\r\nlength waking, she found at her feet Nerkes and Cafour, who informed her\r\nby their signs, that having led Alboufaki to the borders of a lake, to\r\nbrowse on some moss that looked tolerably venomous, they had discovered\r\ncertain blue fishes of the same kind with those in the reservoir on the\r\ntop of the tower.\r\n\r\n“Ah, ah,” said she, “I will go thither to them.  These fish are past\r\ndoubt of a species that by a small operation I can render oracular.  They\r\nmay tell me where this little Gulchenrouz is, whom I am bent upon\r\nsacrificing.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken, she immediately set out with her swarthy retinue.\r\n\r\nIt being but seldom that time is lost in the accomplishment of a wicked\r\nenterprise, Carathis and her negresses soon arrived at the lake, where,\r\nafter burning the magical drugs with which they were always provided,\r\nthey, stripping themselves naked, waded to their chins, Nerkes and Cafour\r\nwaving torches around them, and Carathis pronouncing her barbarous\r\nincantations.  The fishes with one accord thrust forth their heads from\r\nthe water, which was violently rippled by the flutter of their fins, and\r\nat length finding themselves constrained by the potency of the charm,\r\nthey opened their piteous mouths, said:\r\n\r\n“From gills to tail we are yours; what seek ye to know?”\r\n\r\n“Fishes,” answered she, “I conjure you by your glittering scales, tell me\r\nwhere now is Gulchenrouz?”\r\n\r\n“Beyond the rock,” replied the shoal in full chorus: “will this content\r\nyou? for we do not delight in expanding our mouths.”\r\n\r\n“It will,” returned the princess: “I am not to learn that you like not\r\nlong conversations; I will leave you therefore to repose, though I had\r\nother questions to propound.”\r\n\r\nThe instant she had spoken the water became smooth, and the fishes at\r\nonce disappeared.\r\n\r\nCarathis, inflated with the venom of her projects, strode hastily over\r\nthe rock, and found the amiable Gulchenrouz asleep in an arbour, whilst\r\nthe two dwarfs were watching at his side, and ruminating their accustomed\r\nprayers.  These diminutive personages possessed the gift of divining\r\nwhenever an enemy to good Mussulmans approached; thus they anticipated\r\nthe arrival of Carathis, who stopping short, said to herself:\r\n\r\n“How placidly doth he recline his lovely little head! how pale and\r\nlanguishing are his looks! it is just the very child of my wishes!”\r\n\r\nThe dwarfs interrupted this delectable soliloquy by leaping instantly\r\nupon her, and scratching her face with their utmost zeal.  But Nerkes and\r\nCafour betaking themselves to the succour of their mistress, pinched the\r\ndwarfs so severely in return, that they both gave up the ghost, imploring\r\nMahomet to inflict his sorest vengeance upon this wicked woman and all\r\nher household.\r\n\r\nAt the noise which this strange conflict occasioned in the valley,\r\nGulchenrouz awoke, and bewildered with terror sprung impetuously upon an\r\nold fig-tree that rose against the acclivity of the rocks, from thence\r\ngained their summits, and ran for two hours without once looking back.\r\nAt last, exhausted with fatigue, he fell as if dead into the arms of a\r\ngood old Genius, whose fondness for the company of children had made it\r\nhis sole occupation to protect them, and who, whilst performing his\r\nwonted rounds through the air, happening on the cruel Giaour at the\r\ninstant of his growling in the horrible chasm, rescued the fifty little\r\nvictims which the impiety of Vathek had devoted to his maw.  These the\r\nGenius brought up in nests still higher than the clouds, and himself\r\nfixed his abode in a nest more capacious than the rest, from which he had\r\nexpelled the possessors that had built it.\r\n\r\nThese inviolable asylums were defended against the Dives and the Afrits\r\nby waving streamers, on which were inscribed in characters of gold that\r\nflashed like lightning, the names of Alla and the prophet.  It was there\r\nthat Gulchenrouz, who as yet remained undeceived with respect to his\r\npretended death, thought himself in the mansions of eternal peace.  He\r\nadmitted without fear the congratulations of his little friends, who were\r\nall assembled in the nest of the venerable Genius, and vied with each\r\nother in kissing his serene forehead and beautiful eye-lids.  This he\r\nfound to be the state congenial to his soul—remote from the inquietudes\r\nof earth—the impertinence of harems—the brutality of eunuchs—and the\r\nlubricity of women.  In this peaceable society his days, months, and\r\nyears glided on, nor was he less happy than the rest of his companions,\r\nfor the Genius, instead of burdening his pupils with perishable riches,\r\nand the vain sciences of the world, conferred upon them the boon of\r\nperpetual childhood.\r\n\r\nCarathis, unaccustomed to the loss of her prey, vented a thousand\r\nexecrations on her negresses for not seizing the child, instead of\r\namusing themselves with pinching to death the dwarfs, from which they\r\ncould gain no advantage.  She returned into the valley murmuring, and\r\nfinding that her son was not risen from the arms of Nouronihar,\r\ndischarged her ill-humour upon both.  The idea, however, of departing\r\nnext day for Istakar, and cultivating, through the good offices of the\r\nGiaour, an intimacy with Eblis himself, at length consoled her chagrin:\r\nbut fate had ordained it otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, as Carathis was conversing with Dilara, who through her\r\ncontrivance had become of the party, and whose taste resembled her own,\r\nBababalouk came to acquaint her “that the sky towards Samarah looked of a\r\nfiery red, and seemed to portend some alarming disaster.”  Immediately\r\nrecurring to her astrolabes and instruments of magic, she took the\r\naltitude of the planets, and discovered by her calculations, to her great\r\nmortification, that a formidable revolt had taken place at Samarah; that\r\nMotavakel, availing himself of the disgust which was inveterate against\r\nhis brother had incited commotions amongst the populace, made himself\r\nmaster of the palace, and actually invested the great tower, to which\r\nMorakanabad had retired with a handful of the few that still remained\r\nfaithful to Vathek.\r\n\r\n“What,” exclaimed she, “must I lose then my tower, my mutes, my\r\nnegresses, my mummies, and worse than all, the laboratory, in which I\r\nhave spent so many a night, without knowing, at least, if my hair-brained\r\nson will complete his adventure?  No! I will not be the dupe!\r\nImmediately will I speed to support Morakanabad.  By my formidable art\r\nthe clouds shall sleet hail-stones in the faces of the assailants, and\r\nshafts of red-hot iron on their heads.  I will spring mines of serpents\r\nand torpedoes from beneath them, and we shall soon see the stand they\r\nwill make against such an explosion!”\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken, Carathis hasted to her son, who was tranquilly\r\nbanqueting with Nouronihar in his superb carnation coloured tent.\r\n\r\n“Glutton that thou art,” cried she, “were it not for me, thou wouldst\r\nsoon find thyself the commander only of pies.  Thy faithful subjects have\r\nabjured the faith they swore to thee.  Motavakel thy brother now reigns\r\non the hill of pied horses; and had I not some slight resources in the\r\ntower, would not be easily persuaded to abdicate.  But that time may not\r\nbe lost, I shall only add four words: strike tent to-night; set forward;\r\nand beware how thou loiterest again by the way.  Though thou hast\r\nforfeited the conditions of the parchment, I am not yet without hope; for\r\nit cannot be denied that thou hast violated to admiration the laws of\r\nhospitality by seducing the daughter of the emir, after having partaken\r\nof his bread and his salt.  Such a conduct cannot but be delightful to\r\nthe Giaour; and if on thy march thou canst signalize thyself by an\r\nadditional crime, all will still go well, and thou shalt enter the palace\r\nof Soliman in triumph.  Adieu!  Alboufaki and my negresses are waiting.”\r\n\r\nThe Caliph had nothing to offer in reply: he wished his mother a\r\nprosperous journey, and eat on till he had finished his supper.  At\r\nmidnight the camp broke up, amidst the flourishing of trumpets and other\r\nmartial instruments; but loud indeed must have been the sound of the\r\ntymbals, to overpower the blubbering of the emir and his long-beards, who\r\nby an excessive profusion of tears had so far exhausted the radical\r\nmoisture, that their eyes shrivelled up in their sockets, and their hairs\r\ndropped off by the roots.  Nouronihar, to whom such a symphony was\r\npainful, did not grieve to get out of hearing.  She accompanied the\r\nCaliph in the imperial litter, where they amused themselves with\r\nimagining the splendour which was soon to surround them.  The other\r\nwomen, overcome with dejection, were dolefully rocked in their cages,\r\nwhilst Dilara consoled herself with anticipating the joy of celebrating\r\nthe rites of fire on the stately terraces of Istakar.\r\n\r\nIn four days they reached the spacious valley of Rocnabad.  The season of\r\nspring was in all its vigour, and the grotesque branches of the almond\r\ntrees in full blossom fantastically chequered the clear blue sky.  The\r\nearth, variegated with hyacinths and jonquils, breathed forth a fragrance\r\nwhich diffused through the soul a divine repose.  Myriads of bees, and\r\nscarce fewer of Santons had there taken up their abode.  On the banks of\r\nthe stream hives and oratories were alternately ranged, and their\r\nneatness and whiteness were set off by the deep green of the cypresses\r\nthat spired up amongst them.  These pious personages amused themselves\r\nwith cultivating little gardens that abounded with flowers and fruits,\r\nespecially musk-melons of the best flavour that Persia could boast.\r\nSometimes dispersed over the meadow they entertained themselves with\r\nfeeding peacocks whiter than snow, and turtles more blue than the\r\nsapphire.  In this manner were they occupied when the harbingers of the\r\nimperial procession began to proclaim:\r\n\r\n“Inhabitants of Rocnabad, prostrate yourselves on the brink of your pure\r\nwaters, and tender your thanksgivings to heaven that vouchsafeth to shew\r\nyou a ray of its glory; for lo! the commander of the faithful draws\r\nnear.”\r\n\r\nThe poor Santons, filled with holy energy, having bustled to light up wax\r\ntorches in their oratories, and expand the koran on their ebony desks,\r\nwent forth to meet the Caliph with baskets of honeycomb, dates, and\r\nmelons.  But whilst they were advancing in solemn procession and with\r\nmeasured steps, the horses, camels, and guards wantoned over their tulips\r\nand other flowers, and made a terrible havoc amongst them.  The Santons\r\ncould not help casting from one eye a look of pity on the ravages\r\ncommitting around them, whilst the other was fixed upon the Caliph and\r\nheaven.  Nouronihar, enraptured with the scenery of a place which brought\r\nback to her remembrance the pleasing solitudes where her infancy had\r\npassed, entreated Vathek to stop, but he, suspecting that each oratory\r\nmight be deemed by the Giaour a distinct habitation, commanded his\r\npioneers to level them all.  The Santons stood motionless with horror at\r\nthe barbarous mandate, and at last broke out into lamentations, but these\r\nwere uttered with so ill a grace, that Vathek bade his eunuchs to kick\r\nthem from his presence.  He then descended from the litter with\r\nNouronihar.  They sauntered together in the meadow, and amused themselves\r\nwith culling flowers, and passing a thousand pleasantries on each other.\r\nBut the bees, who were staunch Mussulmans, thinking it their duty to\r\nrevenge the insult on their dear masters the Santons, assembled so\r\nzealously to do it with effect, that the Caliph and Nouronihar were glad\r\nto find their tents prepared to receive them.\r\n\r\nBababalouk, who in capacity of purveyor, had acquitted himself with\r\napplause, as to peacocks and turtles, lost no time in consigning some\r\ndozens to the spit, and as many more to be fricasseed.  Whilst they were\r\nfeasting, laughing, carousing, and blaspheming at pleasure on the banquet\r\nso liberally furnished, the Moullahs, the Sheiks, the Cadis, and Imans of\r\nSchiraz (who seemed not to have met the Santons) arrived, leading by\r\nbridles of ribband, inscribed from the koran, a train of asses which were\r\nloaded with the choicest fruits the country could boast.  Having\r\npresented their offerings to the Caliph, they petitioned him to honour\r\ntheir city and mosques with his presence.\r\n\r\n“Fancy not,” said Vathek, “that you can detain me.  Your presents I\r\ncondescend to accept, but beg you will let me be quiet, for I am not over\r\nfond of resisting temptation.  Retire then.  Yet, as it is not decent for\r\npersonages so reverend to return on foot, and as you have not the\r\nappearance of expert riders, my eunuchs shall tie you on your asses with\r\nthe precaution that your backs be not turned towards me, for they\r\nunderstand etiquette.”\r\n\r\nIn this deputation were some high-stomached Sheiks, who taking Vathek for\r\na fool, scrupled not to speak their opinion.  These Bababalouk girded\r\nwith double cords; and having well disciplined their asses with nettles\r\nbehind, they all started with a preternatural alertness, plunging,\r\nkicking, and running foul of each other in the most ludicrous manner\r\nimaginable.\r\n\r\nNouronihar and the Caliph mutually contended who should most enjoy so\r\ndegrading a sight.  They burst out in volleys of laughter to see the old\r\nmen and their asses fall into the stream.  The leg of one was fractured,\r\nthe shoulder of another dislocated, the teeth of a third dashed out, and\r\nthe rest suffered still worse.\r\n\r\nTwo days more, undisturbed by fresh embassies, having been devoted to the\r\npleasures of Rocnabad, the expedition proceeded, leaving Schiraz on the\r\nright, and verging towards a large plain, from whence were discernible on\r\nthe edge of the horizon the dark summits of the mountains of Istakar.\r\n\r\nAt this prospect the Caliph and Nouronihar were unable to repress their\r\ntransports.  They bounded from their litter to the ground, and broke\r\nforth into such wild exclamations as amazed all within hearing.\r\nInterrogating each other, they shouted,\r\n\r\n“Are we not approaching the radiant palace of light, or gardens more\r\ndelightful than those of Sheddad?”\r\n\r\nInfatuated mortals! they thus indulged delusive conjecture, unable to\r\nfathom the decrees of the Most High!\r\n\r\nThe good Genii who had not totally relinquished the superintendence of\r\nVathek, repairing to Mahomet in the seventh heaven, said:\r\n\r\n“Merciful Prophet! stretch forth thy propitious arms towards thy\r\nvicegerent, who is ready to fall irretrievably into the snare which his\r\nenemies the Dives have prepared to destroy him.  The Giaour is awaiting\r\nhis arrival in the abominable palace of fire, where if he once set his\r\nfoot his perdition will be inevitable.”\r\n\r\nMahomet answered with an air of indignation:\r\n\r\n“He hath too well deserved to be resigned to himself; but I permit you to\r\ntry if one effort more will be effectual to divert him from pursuing his\r\nruin.”\r\n\r\nOne of these beneficent Genii, assuming without delay the exterior of a\r\nshepherd, more renowned for his piety than all the Dervises and Santons\r\nof the region, took his station near a flock of white sheep on the slope\r\nof a hill, and began to pour forth from his flute such airs of pathetic\r\nmelody, as subdued the very soul; and awakening remorse, drove far from\r\nit every frivolous fancy.  At these energetic sounds, the sun hid himself\r\nbeneath a gloomy cloud; and the waters of two little lakes, that were\r\nnaturally clearer than chrystal, became a colour like blood.  The whole\r\nof this superb assembly, was involuntarily drawn towards the declivity of\r\nthe hill.  With downcast eyes, they all stood abashed; each upbraiding\r\nhimself with the evil he had done.  The heart of Dilara palpitated; and\r\nthe chief of the eunuchs, with a sigh of contrition, implored pardon of\r\nthe women, whom, for his own satisfaction, he had so often tormented.\r\n\r\nVathek and Nouronihar turned pale in their litter; and, regarding each\r\nother with haggard looks, reproached themselves—the one with a thousand\r\nof the blackest crimes, a thousand projects of impious ambition; the\r\nother, with the desolation of her family, and the perdition of the\r\namiable Gulchenrouz.  Nouronihar persuaded herself that she heard in the\r\nfatal music the groans of her dying father; and Vathek, the sobs of the\r\nfifty children he had sacrificed to the Giaour.  Amidst these complicated\r\npangs of anguish, they perceived themselves impelled towards the\r\nshepherd, whose countenance was so commanding, that Vathek, for the first\r\ntime, felt overawed; whilst Nouronihar concealed her face with her hands.\r\nThe music paused, and the Genius, addressing the Caliph, said:\r\n\r\n“Deluded Prince! to whom Providence hath confided the care of innumerable\r\nsubjects, is it thus that thou fulfillest thy mission?  Thy crimes are\r\nalready completed; and, art thou now hastening towards thy punishment?\r\nThou knowest, that beyond these mountains, Eblis and his accursed Dives\r\nhold their infernal empire; and seduced by a malignant phantom, thou art\r\nproceeding to surrender thyself to them!  This moment is the last of\r\ngrace allowed thee!  Abandon thy atrocious purpose.  Return.  Give back\r\nNouronihar to her father, who still retains a few sparks of life.\r\nDestroy thy tower, with all its abominations.  Drive Carathis from thy\r\ncouncils.  Be just to thy subjects.  Respect the ministers of the\r\nProphet.  Compensate for thy impieties by an exemplary life; and, instead\r\nof squandering thy days in voluptuous indulgence, lament thy crimes on\r\nthe sepulchres of thy ancestors.  Thou beholdest the clouds that obscure\r\nthe sun; at the instant he recovers his splendour, if thy heart be not\r\nchanged, the time of mercy assigned thee will be past for ever.”\r\n\r\nVathek, depressed with fear, was on the point of prostrating himself at\r\nthe feet of the shepherd, whom he perceived to be of a nature superior to\r\nman, but his pride prevailing, he audaciously lifted his head, and\r\nglancing at him one of his terrible looks, said:\r\n\r\n“Whoever thou art, withhold thy useless admonitions.  Thou wouldst either\r\ndelude me, or art thyself deceived.  If what I have done be so criminal\r\nas thou pretendest, there remains not for me a moment of grace.  I have\r\ntraversed a sea of blood, to acquire a power which will make thy equals\r\ntremble; deem not that I shall retire when in view of the port; or that I\r\nwill relinquish her who is dearer to me than either my life or thy mercy.\r\nLet the sun appear!  Let him illumine my career!  It matters not where it\r\nmay end.”\r\n\r\nOn uttering these words, which made even the Genius shudder, Vathek threw\r\nhimself into the arms of Nouronihar, and commanded that his horses should\r\nbe forced back to the road.\r\n\r\nThere was no difficulty in obeying these orders, for the attraction had\r\nceased, the sun shone forth in all his glory, and the shepherd vanished\r\nwith a lamentable scream.\r\n\r\nThe fatal impression of the music of the Genius remained,\r\nnotwithstanding, in the hearts of Vathek’s attendants.  They viewed each\r\nother with looks of consternation.  At the approach of night, almost all\r\nof them escaped; and, of this numerous assemblage, there only remained\r\nthe chief of the eunuchs, some idolatrous slaves, Dilara, and a few other\r\nwomen, who, like herself, were votaries of the religion of the Magi.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph, fired with the ambition of prescribing laws to the\r\nIntelligences of Darkness, was but little embarrassed at this\r\ndereliction.  The impetuosity of his blood prevented him from sleeping;\r\nnor did he encamp any more as before.  Nouronihar, whose impatience, if\r\npossible, exceeded his own, importuned him to hasten his march, and\r\nlavished on him a thousand caresses, to beguile all reflection.  She\r\nfancied herself already more potent than Balkis; {134} and pictured to\r\nher imagination the Genii falling prostrate at the foot of her throne.\r\nIn this manner they advanced by moonlight, till they came within view of\r\nthe two towering rocks, that form a kind of portal to the valley, at\r\nwhose extremity rose the vast ruins of Istakar.  Aloft on the mountain,\r\nglimmered the fronts of various royal mausoleums, the horror of which was\r\ndeepened by the shadows of night.  They passed through two villages,\r\nalmost deserted; the only inhabitants remaining being a few feeble old\r\nmen, who at the sight of horses and litters fell upon their knees, and\r\ncried out:\r\n\r\n“O heaven! is it then by these phantoms that we have been for six months\r\ntormented!  Alas! it was from the terror of these spectres, and the noise\r\nbeneath the mountains, that our people have fled, and left us at the\r\nmercy of maleficent spirits!”\r\n\r\nThe Caliph, to whom these complaints were but unpromising auguries, drove\r\nover the bodies of these wretched old men, and at length arrived at the\r\nfoot of the terrace of black marble.  There he descended from his litter,\r\nhanding down Nouronihar; both, with beating hearts, stared wildly around\r\nthem, and expected, with an apprehensive shudder, the approach of the\r\nGiaour.  But nothing as yet announced his appearance.\r\n\r\nA deathlike stillness reigned over the mountain, and through the air.\r\nThe moon dilated, on a vast platform, the shades of the lofty columns,\r\nwhich reached from the terrace almost to the clouds.  The gloomy\r\nwatch-towers, whose number could not be counted, were veiled by no roof:\r\nand their capitals, of an architecture unknown in the records of the\r\nearth, served as an asylum for the birds of darkness, which, alarmed at\r\nthe approach of such visitants, fled away croaking.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the eunuchs, trembling with fear, besought Vathek that a\r\nfire might be kindled.\r\n\r\n“No!” replied he, “there is no time left to think of such trifles; abide\r\nwhere thou art, and expect my commands.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken, he presented his hand to Nouronihar, and ascending\r\nthe steps of a vast staircase, reached the terrace, which was flagged\r\nwith squares of marble, and resembled a smooth expanse of water, upon\r\nwhose surface not a leaf ever dared to vegetate.  On the right rose the\r\nwatch-towers, ranged before the ruins of an immense palace, whose walls\r\nwere embossed with various figures.  In front stood forth the colossal\r\nforms of four creatures, composed of the leopard and the griffin; and\r\nthough but of stone, inspired emotions of terror.  Near these were\r\ndistinguished by the splendour of the moon, which streamed full on the\r\nplace, characters like those on the sabres of the Giaour, that possessed\r\nthe same virtue of changing every moment.  These, after vacillating for\r\nsome time, at last fixed in Arabic letters, and prescribed to the Caliph\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n“Vathek! thou hast violated the conditions of my parchment, and deservest\r\nto be sent back; but in favour to thy companion, and as the meed for what\r\nthou hast done to obtain it, Eblis permitteth that the portal of his\r\npalace shall be opened, and the subterranean fire will receive thee into\r\nthe number of its adorers.”\r\n\r\nHe scarcely had read these words before the mountain, against which the\r\nterrace was reared, trembled; and the watch-towers were ready to topple\r\nheadlong upon them.  The rock yawned, and disclosed within it a staircase\r\nof polished marble, that seemed to approach the abyss.  Upon each stair\r\nwere planted two large torches, like those Nouronihar had seen in her\r\nvision, the camphorated vapour ascending from which gathered into a cloud\r\nunder the hollow of the vault.\r\n\r\nThis appearance, instead of terrifying, gave new courage to the daughter\r\nof Fakreddin.  Scarcely deigning to bid adieu to the moon and the\r\nfirmament, she abandoned without hesitation the pure atmosphere, to\r\nplunge into these infernal exhalations.   The gait of those impious\r\npersonages was haughty and determined.  As they descended, by the\r\neffulgence of the torches, they gazed on each other with mutual\r\nadmiration, and both appeared so resplendent, that they already esteemed\r\nthemselves spiritual intelligences.  The only circumstance that perplexed\r\nthem, was their not arriving at the bottom of the stairs.  On hastening\r\ntheir descent, with an ardent impetuosity, they felt their steps\r\naccelerated to such a degree, that they seemed not walking, but falling\r\nfrom a precipice.  Their progress, however, was at length impeded by a\r\nvast portal of ebony, which the Caliph without difficulty recognized.\r\nHere the Giaour awaited them, with the key in his hand,\r\n\r\n“Ye are welcome!” said he to them, with a ghastly smile, “in spite of\r\nMahomet, and all his dependents.  I will now admit you into that palace,\r\nwhere you have so highly merited a place.”\r\n\r\nWhilst he was uttering these words, he touched the enamelled lock with\r\nhis key, and the doors at once expanded with a noise still louder than\r\nthe thunder of mountains, and as suddenly recoiled the moment they had\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph and Nouronihar beheld each other with amazement, at finding\r\nthemselves in a place which, though roofed with a vaulted ceiling, was so\r\nspacious and lofty, that at first they took it for an immeasurable plain.\r\nBut their eyes at length growing to the grandeur of the objects at hand,\r\nthey extended their view to those at a distance, and discovered rows of\r\ncolumns and arcades, which gradually diminished, till they terminated in\r\na point, radiant as the sun, when he darts his last beams athwart the\r\nocean.  The pavement, strewed over with gold dust and saffron, exhaled so\r\nsubtile an odour, as almost overpowered them.  They, however, went on,\r\nand observed an infinity of censers, in which ambergris and the wood of\r\naloes were continually burning.  Between the several columns were placed\r\ntables, each spread with a profusion of viands, and wines of every\r\nspecies, sparkling in vases of chrystal.  A throng of Genii, and other\r\nphantastic spirits, of each sex, danced lasciviously in troops, at the\r\nsound of music which issued from beneath.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this immense hall, a vast multitude was incessantly\r\npassing, who severally kept their right hands on their hearts, without\r\nonce regarding any thing around them.  They had all the livid paleness of\r\ndeath.  Their eyes, deep sank in their sockets, resembled those\r\nphosphoric meteors, that glimmer by night in places of interment.  Some\r\nstalked slowly on, absorbed in profound reverie; some shrieking with\r\nagony, ran furiously about, like tigers wounded with poisoned arrows;\r\nwhilst others, grinding their teeth in rage, foamed along, more frantic\r\nthan the wildest maniac.  They all avoided each other, and though\r\nsurrounded by a multitude that no one could number, each wandered at\r\nrandom unheedful of the rest, as if alone on a desert which no foot had\r\ntrodden.\r\n\r\nVathek and Nouronihar, frozen with terror at a sight so baleful, demanded\r\nof the Giaour what these appearances might mean, and why these ambulating\r\nspectres never withdrew their hands from their hearts.\r\n\r\n“Perplex not yourselves,” replied he bluntly, “with so much at once, you\r\nwill soon be acquainted with all; let us haste and present you to Eblis.”\r\n\r\nThey continued their way through the multitude, but notwithstanding their\r\nconfidence at first, they were not sufficiently composed to examine with\r\nattention the various perspectives of halls, and of galleries, that\r\nopened on the right hand and left, which were all illuminated by torches\r\nand braziers, whose flames rose in pyramids, to the centre of the vault.\r\nAt length they came to a place where long curtains, brocaded with crimson\r\nand gold, fell from all parts, in striking confusion.  Here the choirs\r\nand dances were heard no longer.  The light which glimmered came from\r\nafar.\r\n\r\nAfter some time Vathek and Nouronihar perceived a gleam brightening\r\nthrough the drapery, and entered a vast tabernacle, carpeted with the\r\nskins of leopards.  An infinity of elders, with streaming beards, and\r\nafrits, in complete armour, had prostrated themselves before the ascent\r\nof a lofty eminence, on the top of which, upon a globe of fire, sat the\r\nformidable Eblis.  His person was that of a young man, whose noble and\r\nregular features seemed to have been tarnished by malignant vapours.  In\r\nhis large eyes appeared both pride and despair; his flowing hair retained\r\nsome resemblance to that of an angel of light.  In his hand, which\r\nthunder had blasted, he swayed the iron sceptre, that causes the monster\r\nOuranabad, {140} the afrits, and all the powers of the abyss to tremble.\r\nAt his presence the heart of the Caliph sank within him, and, for the\r\nfirst time, he fell prostrate on his face.  Nouronihar, however, though\r\ngreatly dismayed, could not help admiring the person of Eblis, for she\r\nexpected to have seen some stupendous giant.  Eblis, with a voice more\r\nmild than might be imagined, but such as transfused through the soul the\r\ndeepest melancholy, said:\r\n\r\n“CREATURES OF CLAY, I receive you into mine empire.  Ye are numbered\r\namongst my adorers.  Enjoy whatever this palace affords—the treasures of\r\nthe preadimite sultans, their bickering sabres, and those talismans that\r\ncompel the Dives to open the subterranean expanses of the mountain of\r\nKaf, which communicate with these.  There, insatiable as your curiosity\r\nmay be, shall you find sufficient to gratify it.  You shall possess the\r\nexclusive privilege of entering the fortress of Aherman, and the halls of\r\nArgenk, where are portrayed all creatures endowed with intelligence, and\r\nthe various animals that inhabited the earth prior to the creation of\r\nthat contemptible being, whom ye denominate the Father of Mankind.”\r\n\r\nVathek and Nouronihar feeling themselves revived and encouraged by this\r\nharangue, eagerly said to the Giaour:\r\n\r\n“Bring us instantly to the place which contains these precious\r\ntalismans.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” answered this wicked Dive, with his malignant grin, “come, and\r\npossess all that my sovereign hath promised, and more.”\r\n\r\nHe then conducted them into a long aisle adjoining the tabernacle,\r\npreceding them with hasty steps, and followed by his disciples with the\r\nutmost alacrity.  They reached at length a hall of great extent, and\r\ncovered with a lofty dome, around which appeared fifty portals of bronze,\r\nsecured with as many fastenings of iron.  A funereal gloom prevailed over\r\nthe whole scene.  Here, upon two beds of incorruptible cedar, lay\r\nrecumbent the fleshless forms of the preadimite kings, who had been\r\nmonarchs of the whole earth.  They still possessed enough of life to be\r\nconscious of their deplorable condition.  Their eyes retained a\r\nmelancholy motion; they regarded each other with looks of the deepest\r\ndejection, each holding his right hand motionless on his heart.  At their\r\nfeet were inscribed the events of their several reigns, their power,\r\ntheir pride, and their crimes.  Soliman Raad, Soliman Daki, and Soliman\r\nDi Gian Ben Gian, who, after having chained up the Dives in the dark\r\ncaverns of Kaf, became so presumptuous, as to doubt of the Supreme Power.\r\nAll these maintained great state, though not to be compared with the\r\neminence of Soliman Ben Daoud.\r\n\r\nThis king, so renowned for his wisdom, was on the loftiest elevation, and\r\nplaced immediately under the dome.  He appeared to possess more animation\r\nthan the rest, though, from time to time, he laboured with profound\r\nsighs, and, like his companions, kept his right hand on his heart; yet\r\nhis countenance was more composed, and he seemed to be listening to the\r\nsullen roar of a vast cataract, visible in part through the grated\r\nportals.  This was the only sound that intruded on the silence of these\r\ndoleful mansions.  A range of brazen vases surrounded the elevation.\r\n\r\n“Remove the covers from these cabalistic depositaries,” said the Giaour\r\nto Vathek, “and avail thyself of the talismans, which will break asunder\r\nall these gates of bronze, and not only render thee master of the\r\ntreasures contained within them, but also of the spirits by which they\r\nare guarded.”\r\n\r\nThe Caliph, whom this ominous preliminary had entirely disconcerted,\r\napproached the vases with faltering footsteps, and was ready to sink with\r\nterror, when he heard the groans of Soliman.  As he proceeded, a voice\r\nfrom the livid lips of the prophet articulated these words:\r\n\r\n“In my lifetime, I filled a magnificent throne, having on my right hand\r\ntwelve thousand seats of gold, where the patriarchs and prophets heard my\r\ndoctrines; on my left the sages and doctors, upon as many thrones of\r\nsilver, were present at all my decisions.  Whilst I thus administered\r\njustice to innumerable multitudes, the birds of the air librating over\r\nme, served as a canopy from the rays of the sun.  My people flourished,\r\nand my palace rose to the clouds.  I erected a temple to the Most High,\r\nwhich was the wonder of the universe; but I basely suffered myself to be\r\nseduced by the love of women, and a curiosity that could not be\r\nrestrained by sub-lunary things.  I listened to the counsels of Aherman,\r\nand the daughter of Pharaoh; and adored fire, and the host of heaven.  I\r\nforsook the holy city, and commanded the Genii to rear the stupendous\r\npalace of Istakar, and the terrace of the watch-towers, each of which was\r\nconsecrated to a star.  There for a while I enjoyed myself in the zenith\r\nof glory and pleasure.  Not only men, but supernatural existences were\r\nsubject also to my will.  I began to think, as these unhappy monarchs\r\naround had already thought, that the vengeance of heaven was asleep, when\r\nat once the thunder burst my structures asunder, and precipitated me\r\nhither; where, however, I do not remain like the other inhabitants\r\ntotally destitute of hope, for an angel of light hath revealed, that in\r\nconsideration of the piety of my early youth, my woes shall come to an\r\nend when this cataract shall for ever cease to flow.  Till then I am in\r\ntorments, ineffable torments, an unrelenting fire preys on my heart.”\r\n\r\nHaving uttered this exclamation, Soliman raised his hands towards heaven,\r\nin token of supplication, and the Caliph discerned through his bosom,\r\nwhich was transparent as crystal, his heart enveloped in flames.  At a\r\nsight so full of horror, Nouronihar fell back like one petrified, into\r\nthe arms of Vathek, who cried out with a convulsive sob:\r\n\r\n“O Giaour! whither hast thou brought us!  Allow us to depart, and I will\r\nrelinquish all thou hast promised.  O Mahomet! remains there no more\r\nmercy!”\r\n\r\n“None! none!” replied the malicious Dive.  “Know, miserable prince, thou\r\nart now in the abode of vengeance, and despair.  Thy heart, also, will be\r\nkindled, like those of the other votaries of Eblis.  A few days are\r\nallotted thee previous to this fatal period: employ them as thou wilt.\r\nRecline on these heaps of gold: command the Infernal Potentates: range at\r\nthy pleasure through these immense subterranean domains.  No barrier\r\nshall be shut against thee.  As for me, I have fulfilled my mission.  I\r\nnow leave thee to thyself.”\r\n\r\nAt these words he vanished.\r\n\r\nThe Caliph and Nouronihar remained in the most abject affliction.  Their\r\ntears unable to flow, scarcely could they support themselves.  At length,\r\ntaking each other despondingly by the hand, they went faltering from this\r\nfatal hall, indifferent which way they turned their steps.  Every portal\r\nopened at their approach.  The Dives fell prostrate before them.  Every\r\nreservoir of riches was disclosed to their view, but they no longer felt\r\nthe incentives of curiosity, pride, or avarice.  With like apathy they\r\nheard the chorus of Genii, and saw the stately banquets prepared to\r\nregale them.  They went wandering on from chamber to chamber, hall to\r\nhall, and gallery to gallery; all without bounds or limit; all\r\ndistinguishable by the same lowering gloom; all adorned with the same\r\nawful grandeur; all traversed by persons in search of repose and\r\nconsolation, but who sought them in vain, for every one carried within\r\nhim a heart tormented in flames.  Shunned by these various sufferers, who\r\nseemed by their looks to be upbraiding the partners of their guilt, they\r\nwithdrew from them, to wait in direful suspense the moment which should\r\nrender them to each other the like objects of terror.\r\n\r\n“What,” exclaimed Nouronihar, “will the time come, when I shall snatch my\r\nhand from thine!”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Vathek, “and shall my eyes ever cease to drink from thine long\r\ndraughts of enjoyment!  Shall the moments of our reciprocal ecstasies be\r\nreflected on with horror!  It was not thou that broughtest me hither; the\r\nprinciples by which Carathis perverted my youth have been the sole cause\r\nof my perdition!”\r\n\r\nHaving given vent to these painful expressions, he called to an Afrit,\r\nwho was stirring up one of the braziers, and bade him fetch the Princess\r\nCarathis from the palace of Samarah.\r\n\r\nAfter issuing these orders, the Caliph and Nouronihar continued walking\r\namidst the silent crowd, till they heard voices at the end of the\r\ngallery.  Presuming them to proceed from some unhappy beings, who like\r\nthemselves were awaiting their final doom, they followed the sound, and\r\nfound it to come from a small square chamber, where they discovered\r\nsitting on sofas, five young men of goodly figure, and a lovely female,\r\nwho were all holding a melancholy conversation, by the glimmering of a\r\nlonely lamp.  Each had a gloomy and forlorn air, and two of them were\r\nembracing each other with great tenderness.  On seeing the Caliph and the\r\ndaughter of Fakreddin enter they arose, saluted, and gave them place.\r\nThen he who had appeared the most considerable of the group, addressed\r\nhimself thus to Vathek:\r\n\r\n“Strangers! who doubtless are in the same state of suspense as ourselves,\r\nas you do not yet bear your hand on your heart, if you are come hither to\r\npass the interval allotted previous to the infliction of our common\r\npunishment, condescend to relate the adventures that have brought you to\r\nthis fatal place; and we in return will acquaint you with ours; which\r\ndeserves but too well to be heard.  We will trace back our crimes to\r\ntheir source, though we are not permitted to repent.  This is the only\r\nemployment suited to wretches like us.”\r\n\r\nThe Caliph and Nouronihar assented to the proposal, and Vathek began, not\r\nwithout tears and lamentations, a sincere recital of every circumstance\r\nthat had passed.  When the afflicting narrative was closed, the young man\r\nentered on his own.  Each person proceeded in order, and when the fourth\r\nprince had reached the midst of his adventures, a sudden noise\r\ninterrupted him, which caused the vault to tremble, and to open.\r\n\r\nImmediately a cloud descended, which gradually dissipating, discovered\r\nCarathis, on the back of an Afrit, who grievously complained of his\r\nburden.  She, instantly springing to the ground, advanced towards her\r\nson, and said:\r\n\r\n“What dost thou here, in this little square chamber?  As the Dives are\r\nbecome subject to thy beck, I expected to have found thee on the throne\r\nof the preadimite kings.”\r\n\r\n“Execrable woman!” answered the Caliph; “cursed be the day thou gavest me\r\nbirth!  Go! follow this Afrit; let him conduct thee to the hall of the\r\nProphet Soliman; there thou wilt learn to what these palaces are\r\ndestined, and how much I ought to abhor the impious knowledge thou hast\r\ntaught me.”\r\n\r\n“The height of power to which thou art arrived, has certainly turned thy\r\nbrain,” answered Carathis; “but I ask no more, than permission to show my\r\nrespect for the prophet.  It is, however, proper thou shouldst know,\r\nthat, as the Afrit has informed me neither of us shall return to Samarah,\r\nI requested his permission to arrange my affairs, and he politely\r\nconsented.  Availing myself, therefore, of the few moments allowed me, I\r\nset fire to the tower, and consumed in it the mutes, negresses, and\r\nserpents, which have rendered me so much good service; nor should I have\r\nbeen less kind to Morakanabad, had he not prevented me, by deserting at\r\nlast to thy brother.  As for Bababalouk, who had the folly to return to\r\nSamarah, and all the good brotherhood to provide husbands for thy wives,\r\nI undoubtedly would have put them to the torture, could I but have\r\nallowed them the time.  Being, however, in a hurry, I only hung him,\r\nafter having caught him in a snare with thy wives; whilst them I buried\r\nalive by the help of my negresses, who thus spent their last moments,\r\ngreatly to their satisfaction.  With respect to Dilara, who ever stood\r\nhigh in my favour, she hath evinced the greatness of her mind, by fixing\r\nherself near, in the service of one of the Magi, and, I think, will soon\r\nbe our own.”\r\n\r\nVathek, too much cast down to express the indignation excited by such a\r\ndiscourse, ordered the Afrit to remove Carathis from his presence, and\r\ncontinued immersed in thought, which his companions durst not disturb.\r\n\r\nCarathis, however, eagerly entered the dome of Soliman, and, without\r\nregarding in the least the groans of the Prophet, undauntedly removed the\r\ncovers of the vases, and violently seized on the talismans.  Then, with a\r\nvoice more loud than had hitherto been heard in these mansions, she\r\ncompelled the Dives to disclose to her the most secret treasures, the\r\nmost profound stores, which the Afrit himself had not seen.  She passed\r\nby rapid descents known only to Eblis and his most favoured Potentates,\r\nand thus penetrated the very entrails of the earth, where breathes the\r\nSansar, or icy wind of death.  Nothing appalled her dauntless soul.  She\r\nperceived, however, in all the inmates who bore their hands on their\r\nheart, a little singularity not much to her taste.  As she was emerging\r\nfrom one of the abysses, Eblis stood forth to her view, but,\r\nnotwithstanding he displayed the full effulgence of his infernal majesty,\r\nshe preserved her countenance unaltered, and even paid her compliments\r\nwith considerable firmness.\r\n\r\nThis superb monarch thus answered:\r\n\r\n“PRINCESS, whose knowledge and whose crimes have merited a conspicuous\r\nrank in my empire, thou doest well to employ the leisure that remains,\r\nfor the flames and torments which are ready to seize on thy heart, will\r\nnot fail to provide thee with full employment.”\r\n\r\nHe said this, and was lost in the curtains of his tabernacle.\r\n\r\nCarathis paused for a moment with surprise, but, resolved to follow the\r\nadvice of Eblis, she assembled all the choirs of Genii, and all the\r\nDives, to pay her homage.  Thus marched she in triumph through a vapour\r\nof perfumes, amidst the acclamations of all the malignant spirits; with\r\nmost of whom she had formed a previous acquaintance.  She even attempted\r\nto dethrone one of the Solimans, for the purpose of usurping his place,\r\nwhen a voice, proceeding from the Abyss of Death, proclaimed:\r\n\r\n“ALL IS ACCOMPLISHED!”\r\n\r\nInstantaneously, the haughty forehead of the intrepid princess became\r\ncorrugated with agony; she uttered a tremendous yell, and fixed—no more\r\nto be withdrawn—her right hand upon her heart, which was become a\r\nreceptacle of eternal fire.\r\n\r\nIn this delirium, forgetting all ambitious projects, and her thirst for\r\nthat knowledge which should ever be hidden from mortals, she overturned\r\nthe offerings of the Genii; and, having execrated the hour she was\r\nbegotten, and the womb that had borne her, glanced off in a whirl that\r\nrendered her invisible, and continued to revolve without intermission.\r\n\r\nAt almost the same instant, the same voice announced to the Caliph,\r\nNouronihar, the five princes, and the princess, the awful and irrevocable\r\ndecree.  Their hearts immediately took fire, and they at once lost the\r\nmost precious of the gifts of heaven—HOPE.  These unhappy beings\r\nrecoiled, with looks of the most furious distraction.  Vathek beheld in\r\nthe eyes of Nouronihar nothing but rage and vengeance; nor could she\r\ndiscern ought in his but aversion and despair.  The two princes who were\r\nfriends, and till that moment had preserved their attachment, shrunk\r\nback, gnashing their teeth with mutual and unchangeable hatred.  Kalilah\r\nand his sister made reciprocal gestures of imprecation; whilst the two\r\nother princes testified their horror for each other by the most ghastly\r\nconvulsions, and screams that could not be smothered.  All severally\r\nplunged themselves into the accursed multitude, there to wander in an\r\neternity of unabating anguish.\r\n\r\nSuch was, and such should be, the punishment of unrestrained passions,\r\nand atrocious actions.  Such is, and such should be, the chastisement of\r\nblind ambition, that would transgress those bounds which the Creator hath\r\nprescribed to human knowledge, and by aiming at discoveries reserved for\r\npure intelligence, acquire that infatuated pride, which perceives not the\r\ncondition appointed to man is, TO BE IGNORANT AND HUMBLE.\r\n\r\nThus the CALIPH VATHEK who, for the sake of empty pomp and forbidden\r\npower, hath sullied himself with a thousand crimes, became a prey to\r\ngrief without end, and remorse without mitigation; whilst the humble and\r\ndespised GULCHENROUZ passed whole ages in undisturbed tranquillity, and\r\nthe pure happiness of childhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n{7a}  _Caliph_.  This title amongst the Mahometans comprehends the\r\nconcrete character of prophet, priest, and king; and is used to signify\r\n_the Vicar of God on earth_.—Habesci’s State of the Ottoman Empire, p. 9.\r\nHerbelot, p. 985.\r\n\r\n{7b}  _One of his eyes became so terrible_.  The author of Nighiaristan\r\nhath preserved a fact that supports this account; and there is no history\r\nof Vathek, in which his _terrible eye_ is not mentioned.\r\n\r\n{8a}  _Omar Ben Abdalaziz_.  This Caliph was eminent above all others for\r\ntemperance and self-denial; insomuch, that he is believed to have been\r\nraised to Mahomet’s bosom, as a reward for his abstinence in an age of\r\ncorruption.  Herbelot, p. 690.\r\n\r\n{8b}  _Samarah_.  A city of the Babylonian Irak, supposed to have stood\r\non the site where Nimrod erected his tower.  Khondemir relates, in his\r\nlife of Motassem, that this prince, to terminate the disputes which were\r\nperpetually happening between the inhabitants of Bagdat and his Turkish\r\nslaves, withdrew from thence; and, having fixed on a situation in the\r\nplain of Catoul, there founded Samarah.  He is said to have had in the\r\nstables of this city a hundred and thirty thousand pied horses; each of\r\nwhich carried, by his order, a sack of earth to a place he had chosen.\r\nBy this accumulation, an elevation was formed that commanded a view of\r\nall Samarah, and served for the foundation of his magnificent palace.\r\nHerbelot, p. 752, 808, 985.  Anecdotes Arabes, p. 413.\r\n\r\n{9}  _Houris_.  The Virgins of Paradise, called, from their large black\r\neyes, _Hur al oyun_.  An intercourse with these, according to the\r\ninstitution of Mahomet, is to constitute the principal felicity of the\r\nfaithful.  Not formed of clay, like mortal women, they are deemed in the\r\nhighest degree beautiful, and exempt from every inconvenience incident to\r\nthe sex.  Al Koran; passim.\r\n\r\n{10}  _Genii_.  Genn or Ginn, in the Arabic, signifies a Genius or\r\nDemon—a being of a higher order, and formed of more subtile matter than\r\nman.  According to Oriental mythology, the Genii governed the world long\r\nbefore the creation of Adam.  The Mahometans regarded them as an\r\nintermediate race between angels and men, and capable of salvation:\r\nwhence Mahomet pretended a commission to convert them.  Consonant to\r\nthis, we read that, “When the servant of God stood up to invoke him, it\r\nwanted little but that the Genii had pressed on him in crowds, to hear\r\nhim rehearse the Koran.”  Herbelot, p. 357.  Al Koran ch. 72.\r\n\r\n{23}  _Accursed Giaour_.  Dives of this kind are frequently mentioned by\r\nEastern writers.  Consult their tales in general, and especially those of\r\n“The Fisherman,” “Aladdin,” and “The Princess of China.”\r\n\r\n{26a}  _Bababalouk_, _the Chief of his Eunuchs_.  As it was the\r\nemployment of the black eunuchs to wait upon, and guard the sultanas, to\r\nthe general superintendence of the Harem was particularly committed to\r\ntheir chief.  Habesci’s State of the Ottoman Empire, p. 155–6.\r\n\r\n{26b}  _The Divan_.  This was both the supreme council, and court of\r\njustice, at which the Caliphs of the race of the Abassides assisted in\r\nperson to redress the injuries of every appellant.  Herbelot, p. 298.\r\n\r\n{27}  _The Prime Vizier_.  Vazir, Vezir, or as we express it, Vizier,\r\nliterally signifies a porter; and by metaphor, the minister who bears the\r\nprincipal burden of the state.\r\n\r\n{50}  _Gian Ben Gian_.  By this appellation was distinguished the monarch\r\nof that species of beings, whom the Arabians denominate _Gian_ or _Ginn_,\r\nthat is, _Genii_; and the Tarik Thabari, _Peres_, _Feez_, or _Faeries_.\r\n\r\n{51}  _Rocnabad_.  The stream thus denominated flows near the city of\r\nSchiraz.  Its waters are uncommonly pure and limpid, and their banks\r\nswarded with the finest verdure.\r\n\r\n{53}  _Moullahs_.  Those among the Mahometans who were bred to the law\r\nhad this title; and from their order the judges of cities and provinces\r\nwere taken.\r\n\r\n{55}  _Bababalouk almost sunk with confusion_, _whilst_, _etc._  The\r\nheinousness of Vathek’s profanation can only be judged of by an orthodox\r\nMussulman; or one who recollects the ablution and prayer indispensably\r\nrequired on the exoneration of nature.  Sale’s Prelim. Disc. p. 139.  Al\r\nKoran, ch. 4.  Habesci’s State of the Ottoman Empire, p. 93.\r\n\r\n{67a}  _Horrible Kaf_.  This mountain, which in reality is no other than\r\nCaucasus, was supposed to surround the earth, like a ring encompassing a\r\nfinger.  The sun was believed to rise from one of its eminences (as over\r\nOcta, by the Latin poets) and to set on the opposite; whence “from Kaf to\r\nKaf,” signified from one extremity of the earth to the other.\r\n\r\n{67b}  _The Simurgh_.  This is that wonderful bird of the East concerning\r\nwhich so many marvels are told.  It was not only endowed with reason, but\r\npossessed also the knowledge of every language.  This creature relates of\r\nitself, that it had seen the great revolution of seven thousand years,\r\ntwelve times, commence and close; and, that in its duration, the world\r\nhad been seven times void of inhabitants, and as often replenished.  The\r\nSimurgh is represented as a great friend to the race of Adam, and not\r\nless inimical to the Dives.\r\n\r\n{67c}  _Afrits_.  These were a kind of Medusa, or Lamia, supposed to be\r\nthe most terrible and cruel of all the orders of the Dives.  Herbelot, p.\r\n66.\r\n\r\n{68}  _Deggial_.  This word signifies properly a liar and imposter, but\r\nis applied by Mahometan writers to their Antichrist.  He is described as\r\nhaving but one eye and eyebrow, and on his forehead the radicals of\r\n_cafer_, or infidel, are said to be impressed.\r\n\r\n{79a}  _Calenders_.  These were a sort of men amongst the Mahometans who\r\nabandoned father and mother, wife and children, relations and\r\npossessions, to wander through the world, under a pretence of religion,\r\nentirely subsisting on the fortuitous bounty of those they had the\r\naddress to dupe.  Herbelot, Suppl. p. 204.\r\n\r\n{79b}  _Santons_.  A body of religionists who were also called _Abdals_,\r\nand pretended to be inspired with the most enthusiastic raptures of\r\ndivine love.  They were regarded by the vulgar as saints.  Olearius, Tom.\r\nI. p. 971.  Herbelot, p. 5.\r\n\r\n{79c}  _Dervises_.  The term _dervise_ signifies a poor man, and is the\r\ngeneral appellation by which a religious sect amongst the Mahometans is\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\n{79d}  _Brahmins_.  These constituted the principal caste of the Indians,\r\naccording to whose doctrines Brahma, from whom they are called, is the\r\nfirst of the three created beings by whom the world was made.  This\r\nBrahma is said to have communicated to the Indians four books, in which\r\nall the sciences and ceremonies of their religion are comprised.\r\n\r\n{79e}  _Faquirs_.  This sect were a kind of religious anchorites, who\r\nspent their whole lives in the severest austerities and mortification.\r\n\r\n{82}  _Peries_.  The word Peri, in the Persian language, signifies that\r\nbeautiful race of creatures which constitutes the link between angels and\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n{134}  _Balkis_.  This was the Arabian name of the Queen of Sheba, who\r\nwent from the South to hear the wisdom and admire the glory of Solomon.\r\nThe Koran represents her as a worshipper of fire.  Solomon is said not\r\nonly to have entertained her with the greatest magnificence, but also to\r\nhave raised her to his bed and his throne.  Al Koran, ch. 27, and Sale’s\r\nnotes.  Herbelot, p. 182.\r\n\r\n{140}  _Ouranabad_.  This monster is represented as a fierce flying\r\nhydra, and belongs to the same class with the _Rakshe_, whose ordinary\r\nfood was serpents and dragons; the _Soham_, which had the head of a\r\nhorse, with four eyes, and the body of a flame-coloured dragon; the\r\n_Syl_, a basilisk with a face resembling the human, but so tremendous\r\nthat no mortal could bear to behold it; the _Ejder_, and others.
