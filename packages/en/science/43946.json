In it are described many invertebrates\r\nand some of the more notable varieties of seaweeds, and each\r\nindividual is given its proper place in the latest classification.\r\n\r\nThe technicality of classification or scientific grouping may at\r\nfirst seem repellent, but it in reality makes the study of these\r\nobjects more simple; and a systematic arrangement has been adopted in\r\nthe belief that it is the easiest as well as the only satisfactory\r\nway of becoming familiar with the organisms described. Without it\r\na very confused picture of separate individuals would be presented\r\nto the mind, and a book like the present one would become a mere\r\ncollection of isolated scraps of information. Morphology, or the\r\nstudy of structure, has been touched upon just enough to show the\r\nobjects from the biologist's point of view and to enable the observer\r\nto go a little beyond the bare learning of names.\r\n\r\nScientific names have been used from necessity, for the plants\r\nand animals of the beach are so infrequently observed, except by\r\nscientific people, that but few of them have common names; and, as\r\na matter of fact, the reader will find that a scientific name is\r\nas easily remembered as a common one. Technical phraseology has,\r\nhowever, been avoided as much as possible, even at the expense of\r\nconciseness and precision; where it has been used, care has been\r\ntaken to explain the terms so that their meaning will be plain to\r\nevery one. A general glossary has been omitted, but the technical\r\nterms used have been indexed. The illustrations will bear the use of\r\na hand-glass, and this will often bring out details which cannot well\r\nbe seen by the unaided eye.\r\n\r\nThe systematic table of the marine algæ, as given in Part I, and\r\nfollowed in the text, will be of use to collectors who wish to make\r\nherbaria. In order to name and group specimens such a guide is\r\nnecessary. Should specific names lead to embarrassment, many of them\r\ncan be neglected, for the names of genera are often a sufficient\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nSince so many species of invertebrates are found on the beach that\r\na complete enumeration of them is impracticable, only the most\r\nconspicuous ones have been selected for description in Part II;\r\nbut the attempt has been made to designate the various classes and\r\norders with sufficient clearness to enable the collector to identify\r\nthe objects commonly found on the shore, and to follow the subject\r\nfurther, if he so desires, in technical books.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that this book will suggest a new interest and pleasure\r\nto many, that it will encourage the pastime of collecting and\r\nclassifying, and that it will serve as a practical guide to a\r\nbetter acquaintance with this branch of natural history, without\r\nnecessitating serious study. Marine organisms are interesting\r\nacquaintances when once introduced, and the real purpose of the\r\nauthor is to present, to the latent naturalist, friends whom he will\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\nGrateful acknowledgment is here made to the following persons who\r\nhave kindly assisted and advised the author and have also extended\r\nvalued courtesies to her in the preparation of this book: Smith Ely\r\nJelliffe, M.D., Ph.D.; Herbert M.

But to the observant eye these\r\napparently desolate reaches are not only teeming with life; they are\r\nalso replete with suggestions of the past. They are the pages of a\r\nhistory full of fascination for one who has learned to read it.\r\n\r\nIn this history even the grains of sand have a part. Though so humble\r\nnow, they once formed the rocky barriers of the shore. They stood\r\nas do the rocks of to-day, defiant and seemingly everlasting, but\r\nthe fury of the sea, which knows no invincible adversary, has laid\r\nthem low. Every coast-line shows the destructive effects of the sea,\r\nfor the bays and coves, the caves at the bases of the cliffs, the\r\nbuttresses, stocks, needles, and skerries, are the work of the waves.\r\nAnd this work is constantly going on.\r\n\r\n  Even a blind man could not stand long upon a shingly beach without\r\n  knowing that the sea was busily at work. Every wave that rolls\r\n  in from the open ocean hurls the pebbles up the slope of the\r\n  beach, and then as soon as the wave has broken and the water has\r\n  dispersed, these pebbles come rattling down with the currents that\r\n  sweep back to the sea. The clatter of the beach thus tells us\r\n  plainly that as the stones are being dragged up and down they are\r\n  constantly knocked against each other; and it is evident that by\r\n  such rough usage all [pg002] angular fragments of rock will soon\r\n  have their corners rounded off and become rubbed into the form of\r\n  pebbles. As these pebbles are rolled to and fro upon the beach they\r\n  get worn smaller and smaller, until at length they are reduced\r\n  to the state of sand. Although this sand is at first coarse, it\r\n  gradually becomes finer and finer as surely as though it were\r\n  ground in a mill; and ultimately it is carried out to sea as fine\r\n  sediment and laid down upon the ocean floor.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Huxley.]\r\n\r\nThe story of the sands is not only one of the conflict of the sea\r\nand rocks; it is also a story of the winds. It is the winds that\r\nhave rescued them from the waves and driven them about, sifting\r\nand assorting them, arranging them in graceful forms, and often\r\nheaping them up into dunes which, until fastened by vegetation, are\r\nthemselves ever moved onward by the same force, sometimes burying\r\nfertile lands, trees, and even houses in their march. The sands,\r\nmoreover, are in turn themselves destructive agents, to whose power\r\nthe many fragments which strew the beach and dunes bear ample\r\nwitness. The knotty sticks so commonly seen on the beach are often\r\nthe hearts of oak- or cedar-trees from which the tiny crystals of\r\nsand have slowly cut away their less solid outer growth. Everything,\r\nin fact, upon the sands is \"beach-worn,\" even to the window-glass of\r\nlife-saving stations, which is frequently so ground that it loses its\r\ntransparency in a single storm.\r\n\r\nThe beach is also a vast sarcophagus holding myriads of the dead.\r\n\"If ghosts be ever laid, here lie ghosts of creatures innumerable,\r\nvexing the mind in the attempt to conceive them.\" And there are\r\ncertain sands which may be said to sing their requiem, the so-called\r\nmusical sands, like the \"Singing Beach\" at Manchester-by-the-Sea,\r\nwhich emit sounds when struck or otherwise disturbed. On some\r\nbeaches these sounds resemble rumbling, on others hooting; sometimes\r\nthey are bell-like and even rhythmical. The cause of this sonorous\r\ncharacter is not definitely known, but it is possibly due to films\r\nof compressed gases which separate each grain as with a cushion, and\r\nthe breaking of which [pg003] causes, in the aggregate, considerable\r\nvibrations. Such sands are not uncommon, having been recorded in\r\nmany places, and they exist probably in many others where they have\r\nescaped observation. They may be looked for above the water-line,\r\nwhere the sand is dry and clean.\r\n\r\nWe have to do, however, in this volume, not with the history of the\r\npast, nor with the action of physical forces, but with the life of\r\nthe present, and to find this, in its abundance, one must go down\r\nnear the margin of the water, where the sands are wet. There is no\r\nsolitude here; the place is teeming with living things. As each wave\r\nretreats, little bubbles of air are plentiful in its wake. Underneath\r\nthe sand, where each bubble rose, lives some creature, usually a\r\nmollusk, perhaps the razor-shell /Solen ensis/. By the jet of water\r\nwhich spurts out of the sand, the common clam /Mya arenaria/ reveals\r\nthe secret of its abiding-place. A curious groove or furrow here and\r\nthere leads to a spot where /Polynices heros/ has gone below; and the\r\nmany shells scattered about, pierced with circular holes, tell how\r\n/Polynices/ and /Nassa/ made their breakfast and their dinner. Only\r\nthe lifting of a shovelful of sand at the water's edge is needed to\r\ndisclose the populous community of mollusks, worms, and crustaceans\r\nliving at our feet, just out of sight.\r\n\r\nEven the tracks and traces of these little beings are full of\r\ninformation. What may be read in the track of a bird on the sand is\r\nthus described by a noted ornithologist:\r\n\r\n  Here are foot-notes again, this time of real steps from real\r\n  feet. . . . The imprints are in two parallel lines, an inch or so\r\n  apart; each impression is two or three inches in advance of the\r\n  next one behind; none of them are in pairs, but each one of one\r\n  line is opposite the middle of the interval between two of the\r\n  other line; they are steps as regular as a man's, only so small.\r\n  Each mark is fan-shaped; it consists of three little lines less\r\n  than an inch long, spreading apart at one extremity, joined at\r\n  the other. At the joined end, and also just in front of it, a\r\n  flat depression of the sand is barely visible. Now following the\r\n  track, we see it run straight a yard or [pg004] more, then twist\r\n  into a confused ball, then shoot out straight again, then stop,\r\n  with a pair of the footprints opposite each other, different from\r\n  the other end of the track, that began as two or three little\r\n  indistinct pits or scratches, not forming perfect impressions of a\r\n  foot. Where the track twisted there are several little round holes\r\n  in the sand. The whole track commenced and finished upon the open\r\n  sand. The creature that made it could not, then, have come out\r\n  of either the sand or the water; it must have come down from the\r\n  air--a two-legged flying thing, a bird. To determine this, and,\r\n  next, what kind of bird it was, every one of the trivial points of\r\n  the description just given must be taken into account. It is a bit\r\n  of autobiography, the story of an invitation to dine, acceptance,\r\n  a repast, an alarm at the table, a hasty retreat. A bird came on\r\n  wing, lowering till the tips of its toes just touched the sand,\r\n  gliding half on wing, half afoot, until the impetus of flight was\r\n  exhausted; then folding its wings, but not pausing, for already a\r\n  quick eye spied something inviting; a hasty pecking and probing to\r\n  this side and that, where we found the lines entangled; a short run\r\n  after more food; then a suspicious object attracted its attention;\r\n  it stood stock-still (just where the marks were in a pair), till,\r\n  thoroughly alarmed, it sprang on wing and was off.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Elliott Coues.]\r\n\r\nFollowing the key further, he draws more conclusions. The tracks are\r\nnot in pairs, so the bird does not belong to the perchers; therefore\r\nit must be a wader or a swimmer. There are no web-marks to indicate\r\nthe latter; hence it is a three-toed walking or wading bird. It had\r\nflat, long, narrow, and pointed wings because it came gliding swiftly\r\nand low, and scraped the sand before its wings were closed. This\r\nis shown by the few scratches before the prints became perfect. A\r\ncertain class of birds thus arrests the impetus of flight. It had a\r\nlong feeling-bill, as shown by the little holes in the sands where\r\nthe marks became entangled; and so on. These combined characteristics\r\nbelong to one class of birds and to no other; so he knows as\r\ndefinitely as [pg005] though he had seen the bird that a sandpiper\r\nalighted here for a brief period, for here is his signature.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that tracks in the sand mean as much to the naturalist as\r\ndo tracks in the snow to the hunter, and trails on the land to the\r\nIndian who follows his course by signs not seen by an untrained eye.\r\n\r\nThe tide effaces much that is written by foot and wing, but sometimes\r\nsuch signs are preserved and become veritable \"footprints on the\r\nsands of time.\" In the Museum of Natural History in New York is\r\na fossil slab, taken from the Triassic sandstone, showing the\r\nfootprints of a dinosaurian reptile now extinct, which, in that long\r\nago, walked across a beach--an event unimportant enough in itself,\r\nbut more marvelous than any tale of imagination when recorded for\r\nfuture ages. From such tracks, together with fragments of skeletons,\r\nthe dinosaur has been made to live again, and its form and structure\r\nhave been as clearly defined as those of the little sandpiper of Dr.\r\nCoues.\r\n\r\n[pg006]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that everything on the land has its counterpart\r\nin the sea. But all land animals are separate and independent\r\nindividuals, while many of those of the sea are united into organic\r\nassociations comprising millions of individuals inseparably connected\r\nand many of them interdependent, such as corals, hydroids, etc. These\r\ncurious communities can be compared only to the vegetation of the\r\nland, which many of them resemble in outer form. Other stationary\r\nanimals, such as oysters and barnacles, which also depend upon\r\nfloating organisms for their food, have no parallel on the land.\r\n\r\nThe water is crowded with creatures which prey upon one another,\r\nand all are interestingly adapted to their mode of life. Shore\r\nspecies are exceedingly abundant, and the struggle for life is there\r\ncarried on with unceasing strife. In the endeavor to escape pursuers\r\nwhile they themselves pursue, these animals have various devices of\r\narmature and weapons of defense; they have keen vision, rapid motion,\r\nand are full of arts and wiles. One of the first resources for safety\r\nin this conflict is that of concealment. This is effected not only\r\nby actual hiding, but very generally by mimicry in simulating the\r\ncolor of their surroundings, and often by assuming other forms. Thus,\r\nfor instance, the sea-anemone when expanded looks like a flower and\r\nis full of color, but when it contracts becomes so inconspicuous as\r\nto be with difficulty distinguished from the rock to which it is\r\nattached. Anemones also have stinging threads (nematophores), which\r\nthey dart out for further defense. [pg007]\r\n\r\nThe study of biology has great fascination, and the subject seldom\r\nfails to awaken interest as soon as the habit of observation is\r\nformed. Jellyfishes, hardly more dense than the water and almost as\r\nlimpid, swimming about with graceful motion, often illuminating the\r\nwater at night with their phosphorescence, showing sensitiveness,\r\nvolition, and order in their lives, cannot fail to excite wonder\r\nin even the most careless observer. Not less interesting are the\r\nthousands of other animals which crowd the shores, lying just beneath\r\nthe surface of the sand, filling crevices in the rocks, hiding under\r\nevery projection, or boldly--perhaps timidly, who shall say?--lying\r\nin full view, yet so inconspicuous that they are easily passed by\r\nunnoticed.\r\n\r\nTo find these creatures, to study their habits and organization, to\r\nconsider the wonderful order of nature, leads through delightful\r\npaths into the realms of science. But even without scientific study\r\nthe simple observation of the curious objects which lie at one's feet\r\nas one walks along the beach is a delightful pastime.\r\n\r\nThe features which separate the classes and the orders of both the\r\nplant and the animal life are so distinctive that it requires but\r\nvery superficial observation to know them. It is easy to discriminate\r\nbetween mollusks, echinoderms, and polyps, and to recognize the\r\nrelationship between univalves and bivalves, sea-urchins and\r\nstarfishes, sea-anemones and corals. The equally plain distinctions\r\nbetween the branched, unbranched, tubular, and plate-like green algæ\r\nmake them as easy to separate.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure of a walk through field or forest is enhanced by knowing\r\nsomething of the trees and flowers, and in the same way a visit to\r\nthe sea-shore becomes doubly interesting when one has some knowledge,\r\neven though it be a very superficial one, of the organisms which\r\ninhabit the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\nROCKY SHORES\r\n\r\nRocky shores furnish an abundance and great variety of objects to the\r\ncollector. The seaweeds here find places of attachment, and the lee\r\nand crevices of the rocks afford shelter to many animals which could\r\nnot live in more open and exposed places. The [pg008] rock pools\r\nharbor species whose habitat is below low-water mark and which could\r\nnot otherwise bear the alternation of the tides.\r\n\r\nThe first objects on the rocky beach to attract attention are the\r\nbarnacles and rockweeds. They are conspicuous in their profusion,\r\nthe former incrusting the rocks with their white shells, and the\r\nlatter forming large beds of vegetation; yet both are likely to be\r\npassed by with indifference because of their plentifulness. They are,\r\nhowever, not only interesting in themselves, but associated with\r\nthem are many organisms which are easily overlooked. The littoral\r\nzone is so crowded with life that there is a constant struggle for\r\nexistence,--even for standing-room, it may be said,--and no class\r\nof animals has undisputed possession of any place. Therefore the\r\ncollector should carefully search any object he gathers for other\r\norganisms which may be upon it, under it, or even in it, such as\r\nparasites, commensals, and the organisms which hide under it or\r\nattach themselves to it for support. Let the rockweed (/Fucus/) be\r\ncarefully examined. Among the things likely to be found attached to\r\nits fronds are periwinkles (/Littorina litorea/), which simulate\r\nthe plant in color, some shells being striped for closer mimicry.\r\nSertularian hydroids also are there, zigzagging over the fronds or\r\nforming tufts of delicate horny branches upon them. Small jelly-like\r\nmasses at the broad divisions of the fronds may be compound\r\nascidians. Calcareous spots here and there may be polyzoans of\r\nexquisite form, while spread in incrusting sheets over considerable\r\nspaces are other species of /Polyzoa/. Tiny flat shelly spirals\r\nare the worm-cases of /Spirorbis/. A pocket-lens is essential to\r\nenable one to appreciate the beauty of these minute forms. Under the\r\nrockweeds are many kinds of crustaceans; perhaps there will also be\r\npatches of the pink urn-like egg-capsules of /Purpura/ at the base of\r\nthe fucus.\r\n\r\nVarious kinds of seaweed abound in the more sheltered parts of the\r\nrocks, and among them will be found amphipods and isopods, many of\r\nwhich are of species different from those of the sandy beaches. Here,\r\ntoo, is the little /Caprella/, imitating the seaweed in form, and\r\nswaying its lengthened body, which is attached to the plant only by\r\nits hind legs. On the seaweeds, as well as in the tide-pool, may be\r\nfound beautiful hydroids, and on [pg009] them the curious little\r\nsea-spiders (/Pycnogonidæ/), animals which seem to be all legs.\r\n\r\nMollusks, and other classes as well, differ in different latitudes.\r\nOn the rocks of the Northern shores /Littorina/ and /Purpura/ shells\r\nare very abundant, the latter in various colors and beautifully\r\nstriped. Limpets are also plentiful, but are not as conspicuous,\r\nsince they have flat, disk-shaped shells. When their capture is\r\nattempted, they must be taken unawares and pushed quickly aside,\r\nelse they take such a firm hold of the rock that it is difficult\r\nto dislodge them. Near low-water mark under ledges will perhaps be\r\nfound chitons, which are easily recognized by their oval, jointed\r\nshells. On the California coast in like localities will be found\r\nthe beautiful /Haliotis/, /Acmæa/, and chitons. Every stone that\r\nis lifted will disclose numbers of little amphipods (/Gammarus/),\r\nwhich will scuttle away on their sides to other shelter; worms will\r\nsuddenly disappear into the mud, and perhaps a crab, here and there,\r\nhaving no alternative, will make a stand and fight for his liberty.\r\nFlat against the stone and not easily perceived may be a chiton, a\r\nplanarian worm, or a nudibranch. And just below the water's edge are\r\nsea-urchins and starfishes, which grow in numbers as the eye becomes\r\naccustomed to the search.\r\n\r\nThe rock pools are natural aquaria, more interesting by far than any\r\nprepared by man. The possibilities of these little sea-gardens are\r\nbeyond enumeration. The longer one studies them the more one finds.\r\nIn them all classes of seaweeds and marine invertebrates may be found\r\nand their habits watched. The great beauty of these pools gives them\r\nan esthetic charm apart from the scientific interest they excite.\r\nPerhaps one may find here a sponge, and removing it to a shallow\r\nvessel of sea-water can watch the currents of water it creates.\r\nSeveral sponges of the same species placed in contact will at the\r\nend of two days be closely united. If the sponges are of different\r\nspecies they will not coalesce.\r\n\r\nIn the clefts and crannies of the rocks are various fine seaweeds,\r\noften of the red varieties, sea-anemones, hydroids, polyzoans,\r\ncrustaceans, mollusks, and ascidians. Crabs will be snugly [pg010]\r\nensconced under projecting surfaces. Most species are more plentiful\r\nat the lowest-water mark, and many are found only at this point and\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDY SHORES\r\n\r\nOn sandy shores the greater part of the inhabitants live under the\r\nsurface. Many give evidence of their presence by the open mouths of\r\ntheir burrows, and some distinctly point out these places by piles\r\nof sand or mud in coils at the opening. Some tubicolous worms have\r\ntheir tubes projecting above the surface. The tubes of /Diopatra/\r\nare hung with bits of shells, seaweeds, and other foreign matter.\r\nSome mollusks announce themselves by spurting jets of water or\r\nsending bubbles of air from the sand. The majority of the underground\r\nspecies, however, give no sign of their presence on the surface,\r\nand must be found by digging. Many of them go deep into the sand,\r\nand in searching for worms the digger must be quick- and expert,\r\nor he will lose entirely or cut in two many of the most beautiful\r\nones, which retreat quickly and to the extremity of their holes at\r\nthe least alarm. One can be a rambler on the sandy beach for a long\r\ntime without being aware of the many beautiful objects which inhabit\r\nthe subsurface of the sand. The curious crab /Hippa/ will disappear\r\nso quickly into the sand that one is hardly sure he has really seen\r\nit. The vast number of worms will surprise any one who searches for\r\nthem by their variety, their beautiful color, and their interesting\r\nshapes. Here again a glass is requisite to appreciate the delicacy\r\nand beauty of their locomotive organs, their branchiæ, and so on. The\r\nmost common of the gasteropod mollusks on sandy shores are /Nassa\r\nobsoleta/, /Nassa trivittata/, and /Polynices (Lunatia) heros/. The\r\nlast are detected by the little mounds of sand which they push before\r\nthem as they plow their way just below the surface. On more southern\r\nbeaches, /Fulgur/, /Strombus/, and /Pyrula/ are the common varieties.\r\n/Olivella/, /Oliva/, and /Donax/, also inhabitants of sandy beaches,\r\nwill quickly disappear when uncovered by the waves, being rapid\r\nburrowers. Most of the many dead shells on the beach will be found\r\nto be pierced with a round hole, which is [pg011] drilled by the\r\nfile-like tongue, or lingual ribbon, of /Polynices/, /Urosalpinx/,\r\nor /Nassa/, which thus reach the animal within and suck out its\r\nsubstance. Another similar species is /Polynices/ (/Neverita/)\r\n/duplicata/, which extends to the Gulf of Mexico, while /P. heros/\r\nis not commonly found below Hatteras. Crustaceans are abundant on\r\nthe sandy beach over its whole breadth. Some of the sand-crabs live\r\nabove tide-mark. Among these is the fleet-footed /Ocypoda/, which is\r\ninteresting to watch. Often they go in numbers to the water's edge\r\nand throw up mounds, behind which they crouch like cats, watching\r\nfor whatever prey the tide may bring up. When unable to outrun a\r\npursuer they rush into the surf and remain there until the danger is\r\npast. The wet sand is often thickly perforated with the burrows of\r\nthe sandhoppers (/Orchestia/). These often rise about the feet as do\r\ngrasshoppers in the fields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I. Egg-capsules of Purpura lapillus. Egg-case of\r\nPolynices heros. Egg-capsules of Buccinum undatum. Egg-case of the\r\nskate. Fulgur canaliculata (whelk) and egg-cases.]\r\n\r\n/Hippa talpoida/ is a remarkable crab, somewhat resembling an egg.\r\nIt is not likely to be seen unless searched for by digging at the\r\nwater's edge. It burrows so rapidly that one must be quick to catch\r\nit after it is exposed by the shovel. In some places the tests of\r\n\"sand-dollars\" are common. The living animal may be found buried just\r\nbelow the surface at extreme low-water mark.\r\n\r\nThe sea-wrack drifted in lines along the shore will repay careful\r\nexamination, for here will be found many things belonging to other\r\nshores and deep water. It is often alive with sandhoppers, which\r\nhop away while one searches for less common things. Often the most\r\ndelicate seaweeds, numerous small shells, worms, polyzoans, etc.,\r\nwill be found there.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the sand-beach is strewn with remains of many species,\r\nusually beach-worn, but interesting nevertheless as examples of\r\nspecies one would like to find in better condition, but good\r\nspecimens of which elude ordinary search or are unobtainable except\r\nby dredging.\r\n\r\nEgg-cases form another class of objects which are often gathered with\r\nno idea of their identity. Of these the most common are the long\r\nstrings of saucer-like capsules which contain the eggs of the mollusk\r\n/Fulgur/, those having square edges being [pg012] the egg-cases of\r\n/F. carica/, and those having sharp edges those of /F. canaliculata/.\r\nCollar-like sandy rings contain the eggs of /Polynices/ (/Lunatia/),\r\nwhich are cemented together in this shape. The boys of Cape Cod\r\ncall them \"tommy-cod houses.\" Cylindrical piles of little capsules,\r\nsometimes called \"ears of corn,\" hold the eggs of /Chrysodomus/. The\r\nirregular masses of small hemispherical capsules are those of the\r\ncommon whelk (/Buccinum/). The so-called \"Devil's pocket-books\" are\r\nthe egg-cases of the skate.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUDDY SHORES\r\n\r\nOn muddy shores the eel-grass (/Zostera marina/) grows abundantly,\r\ngiving an appearance of submerged meadows. It is one of the very\r\nfew flowering plants which live in salt water. In summer its little\r\ngreen blossoms may be seen in grooves on the leaf-like blades. Many\r\nanimals live on and among eel-grass. Found upon it is the delicate\r\ngasteropod mollusk /Lacuna vincta/, and its eggs in little rings; the\r\niridescent /Margarita helicina/, and /Nassa/, with its bright-yellow\r\neggs in small gelatinous masses; also little worms (/Spirorbis/) in\r\ntiny flat spiral shells, compound ascidians in jelly-like masses,\r\nclusters of shelly or horny polyzoans, isopods, planarian worms, and\r\nso on. Scallops (/Pecten/) will be found at the base of the plants,\r\nand the common prawns are very numerous, swimming freely about. Mud\r\nflats and shores are the homes of many mollusks, especially of /Nassa\r\nobsoleta/,--which is the most abundant shell of any considerable size\r\nfrom Cape Cod to the Gulf of Mexico,--and of vast numbers of the tiny\r\n/Littorinella minuta/, which serve as food for fishes and aquatic\r\nbirds. Clams and worms of all varieties are also abundant.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of mud-crabs, of which the most common\r\nare the \"fiddlers,\" which honeycomb the banks and the surface of\r\nsalt-marshes with their burrows. The common edible crab /Callinectes\r\nhastatus/ is plentiful in bays and estuaries. The sluggish\r\nspider-crabs hide beneath the surface of the mud and in decaying\r\nweeds and eel-grass. Hermit-crabs are plentiful here as well as\r\nelsewhere. /Panopeus/ is a sluggish crab found in shallow water and\r\nin all sorts of hiding-places along the shore. It [pg013] may often\r\nbe found in dead shells, and, in the South, in holes in the banks.\r\nThis genus is represented by a number of species, some of which are\r\nquite pretty.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHARVES AND BRIDGES\r\n\r\nOn the piles of wharves and bridges may often be found beautiful\r\ntubularian hydroids in large tufts just below low-water mark,\r\nbranched hydroids looking like little shrubs, polyzoans,\r\nsea-anemones, mollusks, and ascidians. The species peculiar to these\r\nlocalities are the boring mollusk /Teredo navalis/, or ship-worm, the\r\nboring isopod /Limnoria lignorum/, and the boring amphipod /Chelura\r\nterebrans/, all of which penetrate the wood and are most destructive.\r\n\r\nThe animals and plants of tropical beaches and coral reefs are\r\nso various and abundant, so curious and beautiful, as to make\r\na description or even an enumeration of them in a brief space\r\ndifficult. The collector is bewildered and excited when he first\r\nviews the profusion of the wonderful forms there found.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that a fine species of \"stony coral\"\r\nis common from Cape Cod southward, growing in clear water as an\r\nincrustation on rocks, and developing little spires as it advances in\r\nage. This species, the /Astrangia danaë/, is especially interesting,\r\nsince it will live in a dish of clear sea-water, and the polyps will\r\nexpand, showing a very close relationship to the sea-anemone. With\r\ncare in changing the water this coral will live for days, and may be\r\nexamined in its expanded condition with a lens of moderate power.\r\n\r\nThe most favorable time for collecting on any beach is at the lowest\r\ntide, many objects being then uncovered which do not appear higher up\r\non the beach. At the spring-tides, which occur twice a month, at the\r\nperiod of the new and that of the full moon, the ebb is especially\r\nlow, and affords an opportunity to search for forms whose habitat is\r\nbelow ordinary low-water mark. During storms deep-water forms are\r\noften torn from their beds and cast upon the beach. Shore-collecting\r\nat these times is often very interesting. [pg014]\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT FOR COLLECTING INVERTEBRATES\r\n\r\nThe equipment for collecting upon sandy beaches is a shovel, a sieve,\r\nand a net. Numerous trials should be made with the shovel from about\r\nhalf-tide mark to as deep as one cares to wade, and the sand raised\r\nshould be carefully searched for shells, crustaceans, and worms.\r\nBy washing out the sand in the sieve the smallest specimens, which\r\nmight otherwise escape notice, may be secured. On a rocky beach a\r\nstrong knife and a net are sufficient. It is well to have a number\r\nof homeopathic vials for small specimens, which will be injured\r\nby contact with larger forms, and jars for holding the general\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVING INVERTEBRATES\r\n\r\nTo preserve specimens, they should first be placed in a weak solution\r\nof alcohol, the strength of which should be increased gradually until\r\nthe animal is entirely free from water and is hardened throughout.\r\nIf the alcohol becomes colored and sediment falls to the bottom\r\nof the jar, the animal is degenerating, and the alcohol should be\r\nchanged. Specimens for transportation can be packed by wrapping each\r\none in a bit of cheese-cloth and then placing them together in a\r\nlarge receptacle. Care should be taken to keep the fragile specimens\r\nseparate. Sand-dollars possess a pigment which discolors and soon\r\nvitiates alcohol, and consequently these should be separated from\r\nthe other forms and placed where the alcohol may be changed from\r\ntime to time as appears necessary. The homeopathic vials containing\r\nsmall specimens may be put into the can without injury to the other\r\nspecimens. Special cans of various sizes, with handles and screw\r\ncovers, are made for naturalists. One of these cans is a convenient\r\nreceptacle for carrying the alcohol to the station and for receiving\r\nthe collection for transportation. Careful notes should be made on\r\nthe spot of the conditions under which the species are found. One is\r\nlikely to forget details if this is delayed until one reaches home.\r\nLabels should be used, giving name when known, or a number when the\r\nname is not known, [pg015] corresponding with the note-book. Names\r\nwritten with lead-pencil on a slip of paper will not be defaced by or\r\ninjure the alcohol. Collections when arranged permanently should be\r\nplaced in glass jars, the species being kept separate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING AND PRESERVING SEAWEEDS\r\n\r\nTo collect seaweeds one must search for them on rocks, in tide-pools,\r\nin the sea-wrack upon the beach, on piles of wharves, on eel-grass,\r\nand on the surface of incoming waves. It is well to follow the\r\nreceding tide and take advantage of its lowest ebb (especially of\r\nthat of the spring-tides, as mentioned above) to search the extreme\r\nlimit of the beach in the short time it is exposed. Many of the red\r\nseaweeds are found there.\r\n\r\nThe equipment for collecting consists of a basket, two small tin\r\npails, one small enough to be carried within the other, a staff\r\nwith an iron edge at one end and a small net at the other, and a\r\npocket-lens. Rockweeds (/Fucus/) or other coarse gelatinous seaweeds\r\nshould be put into the basket. The pails, half filled with sea-water,\r\nwill receive the other specimens, fine and delicate algæ being put\r\ninto the smaller pail. It is well to have a second small receptacle\r\nfor /Callithamnion/ and /Griffithsia/, if one can be further\r\nburdened. /Desmarestia/ should be kept apart, if possible, since it\r\ndiscolors and decomposes other algæ; it should also have the earliest\r\nattention when the time comes for mounting, and salt water should\r\nbe used for floating it upon the mount, otherwise the beauty of the\r\nspecimen will be impaired.\r\n\r\nBesides its use as a support, the staff is needed to dislodge\r\nspecimens from the rocks, and the net to secure those that are\r\nfloating just out of reach. When possible, it is desirable to secure\r\nthe whole plant, including the holdfast, and to gather several\r\nplants of the same species, since they vary with age and other\r\nconditions, and it is also well to have duplicates for exchange. It\r\nis particularly desirable to obtain plants which are in fruit. Each\r\nspecimen as it is taken should be rinsed in the sea-water to free it\r\nfrom sand.\r\n\r\nCollections should be mounted as soon as convenient, and [pg016]\r\nespecial care in this respect should be taken with red algæ, as they\r\ndecompose quickly. The requisites for mounting are blotters, pieces\r\nof muslin, two or more smooth boards, weights, a basin, and several\r\nshallow dishes containing water. Fresh water has a strong action on\r\nthe color and substance of seaweeds, and specimens should not be left\r\nin it for any length of time.\r\n\r\nLift a specimen from the general collection, and in a basin of deep\r\nwater carefully wash off all superfluous matter; then place it in\r\nshallow water and spread it out, trimming it judiciously, so that\r\nwhen mounted it will not be too thick and the characteristics be\r\nhidden. Specimens are more interesting and their species more easily\r\ndetermined when laid out rather thin, showing their branching and\r\nfruit. After the specimen is thus prepared, place it in a second\r\nshallow dish of water. It should now be perfectly clean. Float it out\r\ninto the desired position, spreading it well, letting some parts show\r\nthe details of the branching, and other parts the general natural\r\neffect of the mass. Run under it a rather heavy sheet of white paper,\r\nand lift it carefully from the water. If raised from the center,\r\nit is easier to let the water subside evenly and gradually without\r\ndisarranging the parts. Some collectors find it better to float the\r\nspecimen in water deep enough to allow the left hand to be placed\r\nunder the sheet to raise it. Lay the sheet on a plate, and with a\r\nneedle or forceps rearrange any of the delicate parts which have\r\nfallen together. A few drops of water placed on any portion will\r\nusually be sufficient to enable one to separate the branchlets or\r\nultimate ramifications. A magnifying-glass will be useful in this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nCover a blotter with mounted specimens, spread over them a piece\r\nof cotton cloth, and on this place another blotter, upon which lay\r\nmore mounted specimens and a cloth. Proceed in this way until all\r\nthe specimens are used. Lay the pile of blotters between boards, and\r\non them place the weights. The weights should not be very heavy.\r\nJudgment must be used in assorting the specimens, those that are fine\r\nbeing placed together. Those that are coarse and likely to indent\r\nthe blotters should be placed between separate boards. In this way a\r\nflat surface and an even pressure will be obtained. The blotters and\r\ncloths should be [pg017] changed twice each of the first two days,\r\nthen the cloths should be removed and the specimens left in press for\r\na week, the blotters being changed daily. Be sure that the specimens\r\nare perfectly dry before placing them in the herbarium. Label each\r\nspecimen with the name and the date and place of collection.\r\n\r\nThere are some seaweeds which cannot be treated in the above manner.\r\n/Fucus/ if placed in fresh water soon becomes slimy. It is so full of\r\ngelatine that it soon destroys blotters; therefore it is well to hang\r\nit up for several hours and then place it between newspapers, which\r\nshould be frequently changed, and as the plant becomes pliable it\r\nshould be arranged in proper position.\r\n\r\nThose specimens which do not adhere to paper in drying should be\r\nsecured with gum. When it is impossible to mount specimens at the\r\ntime they are collected, they can be preserved by drying; afterward\r\nthey can be soaked and mounted in the usual manner. To dry the\r\nplants, lay them separately upon boards without pressing out the\r\nsea-water, and leave them in an airy, shaded place until thoroughly\r\ndry; then pack them loosely into boxes and label, giving date and\r\nlocality. Blotters or driers can be obtained at botanical-supply\r\nstores at thirty-five cents per quire.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO ARRANGE A HERBARIUM\r\n\r\nThe standard herbarium-paper is sixteen by eleven and a half\r\ninches. The sheets are single, white, smooth, and quite heavy.\r\nThese, together with folded sheets of yellow manila paper, called\r\ngenus-covers, are the only requisites. It is desirable to have also\r\na case of shelves protected by glass doors. The shelves should be\r\ntwelve by eighteen inches, and four to six inches apart. They are\r\nmore convenient when made to slide like drawers.\r\n\r\nThe different species of one genus are gummed on one or more of the\r\nwhite sheets and placed within the folded manila paper, which serves\r\nas a cover. Each specimen should be signed with its name, place, and\r\ndate of collection, thus:\r\n\r\n  /C. rubrum./    Bar Harbor.    Aug. 12, 1899,\r\n\r\nthe generic name being indicated by its initial capital letter and\r\nthe specific name written in full. To this are often added the\r\n[pg018] name of the collector and some interesting comment. On the\r\nlower left-hand corner of the genus-cover is written the generic name\r\nin full and the species of that genus which the cover contains, thus:\r\n\r\n  /Ceramium/  /C. rubrum/\r\n              /C. strictum/\r\n              /C. diaphanum/\r\n\r\nThe genera of an order are then placed within a cover and labeled\r\nin the same way, the legend then having the name of the order on\r\nthe left and the genera on the right of the bracket, [TN: see\r\nTranscriber's Note.] thus:\r\n\r\n  /Rhodymeniaceæ/, suborder /Ceramieæ/\r\n\r\n                     /Callithamnion/\r\n                     /Griffithsia/\r\n                     /Ceramium/\r\n\r\nWhen the order is a large one the genera are distributed through as\r\nmany covers as may be necessary. The covers are then arranged on\r\nshelves in the regular order of their classification, and each shelf\r\nis labeled with the order it contains. Herbarium-sheets cost at\r\nretail one dollar per hundred. Genus-covers cost at retail one dollar\r\nand eighty cents per hundred. [pg019]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first great biological division is into kingdoms, namely, the\r\nanimal kingdom and the vegetable kingdom. Then by classification the\r\nvast number of existing animals and plants are grouped so as to give\r\neach individual a definite place. By this system a beautiful order\r\nis established, which enables the student to find any particular\r\nanimal or plant he may wish to study, and also to know its general\r\ncharacteristics from the name of the group to which it belongs.\r\n\r\nIn broad generalization, objects of wide dissimilarity are recognized\r\nas belonging to the same kingdom, as do trees and grasses, or as\r\ndo birds and fishes. Certain trees or grasses and certain birds or\r\nfishes have such points of resemblance that they plainly show that\r\nthey belong to subdivisions. The most untutored people recognize\r\nthese distinctions, but the naturalist goes further and finds points\r\nof distinction which the casual observer overlooks.\r\n\r\nThe animal kingdom has a varying number of divisions, called\r\n/branches/, /subkingdoms/, or /phyla/. Some late authors have\r\nadmitted twelve divisions, and have given them the name /phyla/. Each\r\nphylum is composed of a group of animals with a plan of structure\r\nwhich is common to themselves, but differs from that of the animals\r\nof all other phyla.\r\n\r\nThe higher animals begin with the twelfth phylum, namely, the\r\n/Chordata/, or vertebrates. These animals have a spinal column, or\r\nseries of vertebræ, while the lower animals, or invertebrates are\r\nwithout a spinal column, and depend for stability [pg020] upon\r\nmuscles or coriaceous or calcareous coverings. The vertebrates\r\nare first represented in the fish-like forms. Bilateral symmetry,\r\nhowever, or the uniform arrangement of parts on each side of\r\na central axis, exists in several groups which are below the\r\nvertebrates, the first pronounced example being found in worms.\r\nGroups lower than worms have their organs arranged around a central\r\naxis or radiating from it, and were once all classed as /radiates/.\r\n\r\nAn animal is classified in accordance with its morphology, anatomy,\r\nhistology, and embryology. Morphology determines its general shape,\r\nthe position of its limbs, eyes, and mouth, and the covering of\r\nits body; anatomy, the arrangement of its internal organs, such as\r\nthe position of its heart, lungs, stomach, etc.; histology, the\r\ncharacter of the tissues of the body; and embryology, the method of\r\nthe development of the animal from the embryo to maturity. It is only\r\nafter these exact discriminations have been made that the groups are\r\narranged. Owing to the greater accuracy resulting from histology and\r\nembryology (methods which have been employed only in later years),\r\nmany changes in classification have been made, and as science\r\nadvances will continue to be made.\r\n\r\nThe primary groups are based on broad general characteristics,\r\nbut their divisions and subdivisions are determined by closer\r\ndistinctions. Animals having shells differ from those having a\r\ncartilaginous or those having a crustaceous covering, and are placed\r\nin different groups. Yet mollusks having a single or a double shell,\r\nhaving spiral or flat forms, living on land, in fresh water, or in\r\nthe sea, while differing from one another, are all of one group.\r\nLobsters and crabs, although both have crustaceous coverings, are\r\nvery unlike; and again, there are many species of both lobsters and\r\ncrabs.\r\n\r\nTo group individuals, noting resemblances as well as differences,\r\na system of classification has been arranged with the following\r\ndivisions:\r\n\r\nKingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family (or Suborder), Genus, Species.\r\n[pg021]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN ITS LOWEST FORMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biological division, or discrimination, between animal and\r\nvegetable life, is based on the manner of assimilating food. Plants\r\nfeed upon mineral substances, or, in other words, assimilate\r\ninorganic matter, while animal life requires for its support\r\nvegetable or some other organic matter.\r\n\r\nAnimal as well as vegetable life in its lowest forms begins with\r\none-celled organisms, which are called respectively /Protozoa/ (first\r\nanimals) and /Protophyta/ (first plants). Both of these divisions\r\nare composed mostly of microscopic objects, and, together with other\r\nminute forms of life of the marine species, constitute a great part\r\nof the /plankton/, or free-floating organisms of the sea. These\r\nminute organisms seem like connecting-links between the two kingdoms.\r\nThey were claimed by both botanists and zoölogists until the use of\r\nthe microscope made close observation of minute structure possible.\r\n\r\nAmong the small animalcules of the phylum /Protozoa/ are some which\r\nare familiar to all by name, such as the /Infusoria/, which are\r\nmost interesting creatures to examine in a drop of water under\r\nthe microscope. A more tangible example of the /Protozoa/ are the\r\n/Foraminifera/. /Foraminifera/, like diatoms, have a shell-like\r\ncovering, and these shells, among the most plentiful of which are\r\nthose of the genus /Globigerina/, fall, as do those of diatoms, in\r\nimmense numbers to the bottom of the ocean, and form respectively\r\nwhat are known as /Globigerina/ and diatomaceous ooze. In course of\r\ntime the sedimentary strata become fossilized; thus, the stone of\r\nwhich the city of Paris is built consists of fossilized [pg022]\r\nforaminifers, and the pyramids of Egypt are built of nummulites,\r\nanother genus of /Foraminifera/. It is estimated that an ounce of\r\nthis deposit contains four millions of these protozoans, so it is\r\nimpossible to conceive the numbers of once living animals represented\r\nin the tombs of the Pharaohs. Telegraph-cables raised from the depth\r\nof two miles bring the message to naturalists that the bottom of the\r\nocean at that depth is composed of little else than the calcareous\r\nshells of /Foraminifera/.\r\n\r\nMany of the lower animals resemble plants in form. Hydroids and\r\npolyzoans are often gathered and preserved as seaweeds. Corals,\r\nsea-anemones, and holothurians are curiously like plants. For a time\r\nthe confusion about the division of animals and plants was partly\r\nowing to this resemblance of forms, and the theory of the animal\r\nnature of corals was for a long time considered to be refuted by\r\nthe testimony of a naturalist who declared that he had seen them\r\nin bloom. Later this class of animals was believed to occupy an\r\nintermediate sphere and partake of the characteristics of both\r\nkingdoms. The name zoöphyte, meaning \"animal-plant\" or \"mingled\r\nlife,\" was adopted because of these resemblances and was formerly\r\napplied to these forms only. To-day it has a broader application.\r\nThere is still a neutral class, called /Protista/, comprising\r\norganisms which have not yet been classified as plants or animals.\r\n[pg023]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF ANIMAL LIFE IN THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nAll living things which inhabit the sea have their appointed\r\nboundaries, and the localization of marine life is as distinct as\r\nis that of terrestrial life. Each kind of beach has forms of life\r\npeculiar to itself. Those animals which inhabit rocky shores or stony\r\nbeaches or sand or mud may be looked for anywhere under similar\r\nphysical surroundings. They are, however, modified by climatic\r\nconditions, and in wide ranges differ in genera and species. The\r\nrocky coast of Maine has a class of sea-urchins and starfishes\r\nwhich are different from those which live on the rocky shores of\r\nthe northern Pacific coast, yet they are all easily recognized as\r\nbelonging to the same family, and a description of typical forms is a\r\nsufficient guide to the recognition of their relationships.\r\n\r\nA bathymetrical division defines the classes of animals according\r\nto the depth of water in which they live. Those which live near the\r\nshore are /littoral/ species, those of the broad sea are /pelagic/,\r\nwhile those living at great depths are /abyssal/.\r\n\r\nTheir modes of life are distinguished by other terms. Those which\r\nfloat at or near the surface and are carried about by the currents,\r\nlike the jellyfishes and the minute organisms mentioned elsewhere,\r\nare /plankton/. Strong swimming animals which move about at will are\r\n/nekton/. Those which are fixed, like oysters, sponges, etc., and\r\nthose which crawl on the bottom, like crabs, echinoderms, etc., are\r\n/benthos/.\r\n\r\nAgain, geographical divisions are named, in recognition of climatic\r\ninfluences. The /boreal/ fauna and flora on the Atlantic [pg024]\r\ncoast extend from Cape Cod northward; the /American/, from Cape Cod\r\nto Cape Hatteras; the /West Indian/, from Cape Hatteras southward. On\r\nthe Pacific coast the divisions, without definite names, are from the\r\nIsthmus to Acapulco, Acapulco to the Gulf of California, Cape Lucas\r\nto the Strait of Fuca. These divisions merge at indefinite lines,\r\nbut the above limits are generally accepted as the points of broad\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nThe shore or littoral fauna is especially abundant and comprises\r\nmore species that are curious in form and beautiful in color than\r\nthe others. The invertebrates of the deep sea are mostly transparent\r\nand of a blue or violet tint, while the fishes are gray or bluish\r\nabove and white beneath, which renders them inconspicuous to their\r\nenemies. [pg025]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nSOME BOTANICAL FACTS ABOUT ALGÆ\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vegetable world is separated into two great divisions:\r\n/thallophytes/, or plants having no distinction of leaf or stem,\r\nand /cormophytes/, or plants which have leaves and stems. All\r\nthallophytes that live in the water and are nourished wholly by water\r\nare called /algæ/.\r\n\r\nA second great division of plants is into /cryptogams/, or those that\r\nhave no flowers, and /phanerogams/, or those that have flowers, by\r\nmeans of which seeds are produced and successive generations of plant\r\nlife continued.\r\n\r\n/Thallophytes/ and /cryptogams/ comprise the lowest and simplest\r\nvegetable organisms. Algæ belong to both these divisions; to the\r\nfirst because they have neither stems nor leaves, and to the second\r\nbecause they have no flowers.\r\n\r\nThe lowest forms of algæ are microscopic in size, each individual\r\nbeing a single cell; but in the ascending scale they attain curious\r\nand beautiful shapes, some growing to a gigantic size and in forms\r\nthat resemble shrubs and trees. The green surface commonly seen on\r\nthe shady side of trees, on stone steps, and in other damp places is\r\none of the species of algæ which consist of a single cell. This plant\r\nor cell divides, and the separate divisions divide and subdivide\r\nagain and again, and in time the aggregate number is great enough to\r\nspread over a comparatively large surface, and thus become visible\r\nto the naked eye. This plant, the /Pleurococcus vulgaris/, is a\r\nfresh-water alga. The /Protococcus nivalis/, or red snow, described\r\non page 33, is a closely allied species. The green and blue-green\r\nscums and slimes on [pg026] brackish ditches and on the stones and\r\nwoodwork of wharves are also species of the lowest orders of algæ\r\nand increase by cell-division. Many of them are in colonies incased\r\nin gelatinous matter. These, together with plants of a little higher\r\norder, though still of low organization, the /Confervaceæ/, form a\r\nlarge part of the green vegetation between tide-marks.\r\n\r\nThe vegetative body of a thallophyte is a /thallus/, and corresponds\r\nto stem and leaf. It is also called a /frond/. What corresponds to\r\nthe root of flowering plants is in algæ a disk or conical expansion\r\nof the base of the plant. It is simply a holdfast by which the frond\r\nattaches itself to any submerged material. The algæ which grow on\r\nsandy shores and on corals have holdfasts which branch like fibrous\r\nroots and penetrate porous substances in all directions; but this\r\nis only for greater stability, and is an adaptation to the habitat.\r\nHoldfasts do nothing for algæ other than the name implies, whereas\r\nreal roots absorb the nourishment upon which plants live. Algæ are\r\nnourished by the substances held in solution by the water which\r\nsurrounds them.\r\n\r\nAlgæ are the lowest and simplest in organization of all plants,\r\nbecause they are composed of but one class of cells, such as in\r\nflowering plants are called the /parenchyma/, or soft cells, these\r\nbeing the ones which compose the pulp of the leaf. In the lowest\r\norders of algæ single cells constitute individual plants, as in\r\n/Pleurococcus/; but in the higher forms, such as /Sargassum/, they\r\narrange themselves in such a variety of combinations as to resemble\r\nplants which have leaf and stem. The botanical distinction is that in\r\nleaf and stem there would exist the woody and the vascular cells as\r\nwell as the parenchyma cells.\r\n\r\nBeginning with plants composed of a single cell, the next development\r\nis into filamentous plants, which are single thread-like rows of\r\ncells, as in /Cladophora/. In /Ulva/ is seen the earliest type of an\r\nexpanded leaf. The cells are here arranged in a horizontal surface of\r\nplate-like or ribbon-like shape.\r\n\r\nIn /Ulva/ there is a double layer of cells. The layers separate in\r\n/Enteromorpha/, giving a hollow or tubular form. In /Monostroma/ a\r\ndouble layer is opened or torn apart, giving a frond with a single\r\nlayer of cells. [pg027]\r\n\r\nThe stem-like forms of certain algæ are composed of cylindrical\r\ncells which combine or grow in a longitudinal direction chiefly.\r\nSometimes the cells are arranged evenly, in which case the stem\r\nseems articulated, as in some species of /Ceramium/. Again, they are\r\nirregularly placed, so that the stem appears solid.\r\n\r\nThe highest types of algæ in the differentiation of parts, or\r\nvegetative forms, are to be found in the /Fucaceæ/, of the brown\r\nseaweeds; the highest in the reproductive development, in the red\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nReproduction by cell-division, in which the organism itself breaks up\r\ninto two or more individuals, is called /vegetative reproduction/.\r\nHigher forms reproduce by spores, or germ-cells, which give rise to\r\nnew individuals on germination.\r\n\r\nThe substance of an alga is more or less firm, according as the\r\nvegetable mucus or gelatinous matter it contains has more or\r\nless consistency; it is /membranaceous/ when the gelatine is\r\nscant and glossy, /gelatinous/ when it is abundant and fluid, and\r\n/cartilaginous/ when it is hard.\r\n\r\nSome algæ are annuals; a few are perennials, and cast off and renew\r\ntheir laminæ every season. Many plants present quite a different\r\nappearance at different seasons of the year, and so are often\r\ndifficult to identify. Those which form spores throw off these\r\nisolated cells, which sink or are washed to positions where they\r\ngerminate and begin their cycle of life. Many of the spores begin\r\ntheir growth at once, without regard to season, so the species is\r\never present. [pg028]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nNAMING OF PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real or technical names of plants, which at first appear long and\r\nunpronounceable, are in reality simple when the system of naming is\r\nunderstood. Every plant has a /generic/ and a /specific/ name. The\r\ngeneric name is analogous to the surname of a person, such as /Smith/\r\nor /Jones/. The specific name is analogous to the Christian name of\r\na person, such as /John/ or /James/. The specific name never stands\r\nalone, and would have as little designating character as John ---- or\r\nJames ----.\r\n\r\nThis is called the /binomial/ (two-name) /nomenclature/. It was\r\nintroduced by Linnæus, and greatly simplified the system of naming.\r\nThe rule in scientific nomenclature is that all names must be Latin\r\nor Latinized. This gives a universal language by which scientists of\r\nall countries understand one another.\r\n\r\nThe names of classes (the highest groups) and subclasses are\r\nadjectives or adjective nouns, expressing the most prominent\r\ncharacteristic of the class or subclass. Thus the four subclasses of\r\nthe class /Algæ/ are:\r\n\r\n/Cyanophyceæ/ (subclass of blue-green algæ).\r\n\r\n/Chlorophyceæ/ (subclass of grass-green algæ).\r\n\r\n/Phæophyceæ/ (subclass of dusky-brown or olive-green algæ).\r\n\r\n/Rhodophyceæ/ or /Florideæ/ (subclass of red algæ).\r\n\r\nOrders are, with few exceptions, the names of genera with the\r\ntermination /-aceæ/, as:\r\n\r\n/Ulvaceæ/, from the genus /Ulva/.\r\n\r\n/Ectocarpaceæ/, from the genus /Ectocarpus/.\r\n\r\n/Gigartinaceæ/, from the genus /Gigartina/. [pg029]\r\n\r\nSuborders, or groups between orders and genera, terminate in /-eæ/.\r\nNames of genera are nouns or words taken as nouns. They are derived\r\nfrom any source,--from prominent or peculiar characteristics, from\r\nlocalities, or from names of botanists,--or they may be wholly\r\narbitrary. Personal generic names are divested of titles and take\r\na final /a/, or, in many cases, for euphony, /ia/. Thus, /Ulva/ is\r\nthe Latin for \"sedge\"; /Ectocarpus/ is from two Greek words meaning\r\n\"fruit outside\"; /Corallina/ means \"coral-like\"; /Grinnellia/ is\r\nnamed for Mr. Henry Grinnell.\r\n\r\nThe specific names are commonly adjectives, but sometimes they are\r\nnouns, and occasionally are the names of the botanists who first\r\ndescribed the plants, in which case the name terminates in /-i/ or\r\n/-ii/. The specific name always follows the generic name, thus:\r\n\r\n/Ectocarpus Hooperi/, a species of /Ectocarpus/, first described by\r\nMr. Hooper.\r\n\r\n/Grinnellia Americana/, a species, peculiar to America, of a genus\r\nnamed for Mr. Grinnell.\r\n\r\n/Griffithsia corallina/, a species resembling coral, and belonging to\r\na genus named for Mrs. Griffiths.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the four subclasses mentioned above, it should be said\r\nthat algæ are strictly classified in accordance with their methods\r\nof reproduction; but since allied species have, with few exceptions,\r\nthe same color, the classification by colors is generally adopted as\r\nconvenient and sufficiently precise.\r\n\r\nFamiliar, or, in technical language, \"vulgar,\" names are very\r\ngenerally given to land plants, and especially to flowers; but\r\nseaweeds are less in sight than flowers are, and so, save in a\r\nfew instances, have not been named except by the man of science.\r\nTo remember the scientific names will not be found difficult, for\r\nwithout effort or special pains to acquire the new vocabulary, the\r\nnames, like those of new personal friends, will insensibly become\r\nfixed in the memory.\r\n\r\nIn the body of this work each of the groups (class, subclass, order,\r\netc.), in the classification of both animals and plants, is indicated\r\nby a special kind of type. [pg030]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF ALGÆ\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eastern coast of North America has been divided into four\r\nsections, which correspond to the distribution of the algæ which are\r\ncharacteristic of each section. The boundary-lines are not precise,\r\nsince some species of each section extend beyond the defined limits;\r\nbut arctic forms are not generally found south of Cape Cod, nor\r\ncan tropical varieties be expected north of Cape Hatteras. On the\r\nintervening coast, however, there are some species common to both\r\nsections. The divisions are: (1) Greenland to Cape Cod; (2) Cape Cod\r\nto Cape Hatteras; (3) Cape Hatteras to Cape Florida; (4) the Florida\r\nKeys and the shores of the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific coast such distinct lines of demarcation do not exist,\r\nthere being no such natural barriers as are formed on the eastern\r\ncoast, first by Cape Cod, and, second, by the stretch of sand-beach\r\nwhich extends from New York to Charleston, and which divides sharply\r\nthe climatic varieties.\r\n\r\nThe whole shore is again divided laterally into three distinct belts,\r\ncalled the /littoral/, the /laminarian/, and the /coralline/ zones.\r\nThe first or littoral zone covers the space between tide-marks.\r\nVegetable life in this zone is subjected first to exposure to the\r\nsun and air, and even to desiccation, and then to entire submergence\r\nat constantly recurring periods. The rockweeds (/Fucus/), which\r\nare so plentiful in this zone, are very gelatinous, nature having\r\napparently provided the gelatine to protect the cells of the plant\r\nfrom the effects of the alternating extreme conditions. /Fucus/ and\r\n/Enteromorpha/ predominate in this zone. [pg031]\r\n\r\nThe laminarian zone extends from low-water mark to the depth of\r\nfifteen fathoms. The /Laminariaceæ/ and the beautiful red algæ\r\n(/Florideæ/) grow here.\r\n\r\nThe third or coralline zone extends to the depth of about fifty\r\nfathoms. The algæ of this zone, the nullipores, are incrusted with\r\na deposit of lime which gives them the appearance of corals; and,\r\nsingularly enough, the corals, which are animal forms, simulate plant\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAgain, algæ have special habits and demand certain climates and\r\nseasons for their growth. Algologists register the place where a\r\nspecimen is found, and in this way localities have been pretty well\r\ndetermined. However, great exactness has not been reached, and the\r\ncollector is ever watchful to find an alga in some undiscovered home\r\nwithin the given range. Although algæ grow from extreme high-water\r\nmark to the depth of fifty fathoms, almost every variety may be\r\nfound on the beach, those growing in deep water being frequently\r\ntorn off and washed ashore by the waves. The heaps of sea-wrack\r\nwill often reward one who examines them carefully for deep-water\r\nspecies. Seaweeds are most abundant on rocky shores, particularly\r\nwhere there are stratified rocks with crevices, which afford shelter\r\nfrom the waves. Rock pools often contain beautiful varieties of the\r\nmore delicate species. Red algæ will sometimes be found on the shady\r\nside of these pools. Sand-beaches are unfavorable to the growth of\r\nseaweeds, but fronds which have been carried long distances by the\r\ncurrents will frequently be found on such shores. [pg032]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nSOME PECULIAR AND INTERESTING VARIETIES OF ALGÆ\r\n\r\n\r\nThe species of seaweeds that are known and classified are said to\r\nnumber several thousands. These plants, which have neither vessels\r\nfor the conduction of fluids, nor fibers, consisting simply of\r\nthe first vegetable element, the cell, have, notwithstanding this\r\nlimitation, assumed a great variety of forms. In size they vary\r\nfrom one one-thousandth of an inch in diameter, the smallest green\r\nplants known, to those which exceed in length the height of the\r\ntallest trees and form dense submarine forests, which in places make\r\ncomparatively deep water impassable for boats. In texture they vary\r\nfrom a jelly- to a paper- and a leather-like consistency. In color\r\nthey have all the shades of green, brown, and red.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIATOMS AND OTHER MINUTE ALGÆ\r\n\r\nAmong the smallest algæ are diatoms. They are microscopic in size,\r\nbut exist everywhere in both salt and fresh water, and are infinite\r\nin variety as well as in numbers. They have a silicious, shell-like\r\ncovering, which divides and subdivides in their reproductive growth,\r\nforming varied shapes which are exceedingly beautiful and interesting\r\nto examine under the microscope. In vast numbers they float on the\r\nsurface of the sea, and, together with other minute free-floating\r\norganisms, form the basis of food-supply for fishes. Their\r\nindestructible shells fall to the bottom of the sea, forming large\r\ndeposits, which in time become fossilized. The city of Richmond,\r\nVirginia, is built upon [pg033] a fossiliferous bed of diatoms,\r\nwhich measures twenty to eighty feet in depth and several miles in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nAssociated with diatoms, in fresh water, are desmids, which are green\r\nin color and resemble the diatoms except in having a cartilaginous\r\ninstead of a silicious covering. Another minute organism, /Pyrocystis\r\nnoctiluca/, is luminous and is said to produce the beautiful\r\nphosphorescent effects seen in tropical seas. /Trichodesmium/ is a\r\nlittle alga which periodically occurs in great numbers, giving the\r\nwater a red appearance, as in the Red Sea, which is said to derive\r\nits name from this circumstance.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED SNOW\r\n\r\nIn the high latitudes of the arctic regions, also on snowy mountains\r\nat altitudes where all vegetable life is supposed to be extinguished,\r\nthere sometimes appears a redness on the surface of the snow, which\r\nin some cases extends for many miles. At a certain place in Greenland\r\nthe color was so vivid that an arctic voyager named the locality the\r\nCrimson Bluffs.\r\n\r\nThe strangeness and almost sudden appearance of this color in the\r\nsnow have been so unaccountable to uninformed observers that it has\r\nbeen ascribed by them to the falling of bloody snow and has been\r\nregarded with superstition. The redness is caused by the growth of\r\none of the smallest of plants, the /Protococcus nivalis/. It is a\r\nsimple one-celled alga containing protoplasm and endochrome (red\r\ncoloring-matter). It grows by cell-division, the cell dividing into\r\nfour, eight, or sixteen parts on a quaternary scale. Each part\r\nacquires a new covering while within the mother cell, and when it\r\nemerges it is a complete individual and ready to repeat the process.\r\nOnly a few hours are required for its growth and development; hence\r\nits increase is rapid, and it requires but a little time to make\r\nitself manifest in those places where the conditions are favorable to\r\nits existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SARGASSO SEA\r\n\r\nWhen the voyager reaches a certain region of the North Atlantic,\r\ncalled the Sargasso Sea, he sails into a vast undulating marine\r\n[pg034] prairie. Farther than the eye can reach is spread a\r\nyellowish-brown vegetation which covers the water as grass covers the\r\nplain. Sometimes these weeds are so thick as to impede navigation,\r\nand, seen from a little distance, seem substantial enough to walk\r\nupon. At other times, according to seasons and conditions of storm\r\nand wind, they are divided into strips or into island-like masses,\r\nwith spaces of clear water between. If the sailor did not know the\r\nspecial conditions existing here he might suppose he had come upon\r\ndangerous shallows; or were the waters less turbulent he might dream\r\nthat he was floating among the water-weeds of an inland lake.\r\n\r\nThis vast acreage of vegetation, as large as the continent of Europe,\r\nlying southwest of the Azores and extending between the Canary and\r\nthe Cape Verde Islands, was first reported by Columbus, and takes its\r\nname from the floating plant of which it is composed, the /Sargassum\r\nbacciferum/, a species of the order /Fucaceæ/, commonly known as\r\ngulfweed. Columbus's sailors took fright at the marvelous appearance\r\nand wished to turn back, thinking they had reached the end of the\r\nnavigable ocean. They thought, if land were beyond, it was guarded\r\nby shoals, and that the weeds concealed dangerous rocks. Columbus\r\nthrew out two hundred fathoms of line, but did not reach bottom,\r\nand continued on his course for fifteen days before emerging into\r\nclear water. From that day to this the Sargasso Sea has attracted\r\nthe attention of all navigators. It is especially interesting to\r\nscientists. The physicist finds there the phenomenon of the ocean\r\ncurrents holding in a vortex this immense mass of seaweed, the\r\nzoölogist finds a great pasture in whose protecting shelter are\r\nliving and breeding countless numbers of marine animals, and the\r\nbotanist is puzzled because the source of this species of plant is\r\nclouded with doubt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II. Macrocystis pyrifera. Agarum Turneri.\r\nNereocystis Lütkeana.]\r\n\r\nAccording to one theory, the plants are dislodged by the tempests\r\nfrom terrestrial beds and carried by the Gulf Stream into the\r\nhuge eddy; but since there does not exist enough of the attached\r\nplants of this species to supply the vast accumulation, another and\r\nmore generally accepted theory is that the gulfweed lives also a\r\npelagic life and adapts itself to the conditions of the [pg035]\r\nfloating state, thus dispensing with the disk-like root, as it\r\nneeds no holdfasts, and propagating solely by lateral and axillary\r\nramification.\r\n\r\nThere are said to be one hundred and fifty species of /Sargassum/,\r\nbut /S. bacciferum/ alone constitutes the beds of the Sargasso Sea.\r\nThe plant is the most highly differentiated of any seaweed, in that\r\nit more nearly approaches the true leaf and stem, and is described\r\nbotanically as follows: Frond furnished with distinct, stalked,\r\nnerveless leaves and simple, axillary, stalked air-vessels. The\r\nintegument is leathery, and the color brown of varying shades. The\r\nmost striking peculiarity is the abundance of globular cells. These\r\nberry-like air-bladders give the plant buoyancy enough to support the\r\nweight of its innumerable guests. (Plate XVI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAMINARIACEÆ\r\n\r\nIn the laminarian zone, described above, grow the /Laminariaceæ/, an\r\norder of brown seaweeds, some of whose genera grow to enormous size,\r\nand in some places form dense submarine forests. Darwin speaks of the\r\ngood service rendered by these plants to vessels navigating stormy\r\ncoasts, where often they act as natural breakwaters, and again as\r\nbuoys designating dangerous rocks near the shore on which they grow.\r\nThe seaweeds belonging to this order, commonly known as oarweeds,\r\ntangle, devil's-apron, and sea-colander, are frequently seen twelve\r\nto twenty feet in length, and others are measured by fathoms. One\r\nof the giant plants is /Nereocystis Lütkeana/, which occurs on\r\nthe northwest coast. It has a stalk, sometimes three hundred feet\r\nin length, which bears on its extremity a barrel- or cask-shaped\r\nair-vessel, six or seven feet long, from the surface of which a tuft\r\nof fifty or more forked laminæ grows to a length of thirty or forty\r\nfeet. The stem which anchors this immense frond is so small that the\r\nAleutian Indians use it for fishing-lines. The sea-otter makes his\r\nhome on its huge air-vessel, and the plant is called by the Russians\r\nthe \"sea-otters' cabbage.\"\r\n\r\nBut the longest of all known plants is the alga /Macrocystis/. Its\r\nthin naked stem, the diameter of which seldom exceeds one quarter\r\n[pg036] of an inch, is reported by one author to be seven hundred\r\nfeet in length, by another fifteen hundred feet. It is terminated\r\nby a lamina fifty feet long, resembling a pinnatifid leaf, each\r\nleaflet of which, at its point of division on the stem, expands into\r\nan air-vessel as large as an egg. These air-vessels sustain the\r\nimmense frond which floats on the surface of the water, its leaflets\r\ndepending in a vertical position from the stem. /M. pyrifera/, the\r\nonly species, is found in the Southern oceans and on the Pacific\r\ncoast of North America.\r\n\r\n/Lessonia/, another genus, resembles a palm-tree. It grows erect to\r\na great height and has a stem like the bole of a tree. It branches\r\nin a forking manner and has depending from its branches laminæ two\r\nor three feet long. The large stems from which the laminæ have been\r\ntorn by the storms, and which have been cast ashore on the Falkland\r\nIslands, as described by Sir Joseph Hooker, resemble driftwood, as\r\nthey lie in piles three or four feet high and extending for many\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n/Agarum/ and /Thalassiophyllum/ are arctic genera, but they are found\r\nwithin our limits, the former in the North Atlantic. It has a simple\r\nbut enormous leaf-like frond. The latter, which is found on the North\r\nPacific coast, has a compound frond. Both are characterized by their\r\nfronds being perforated throughout with holes, giving them the name\r\nof sea-colander. [pg037]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nUSES OF ALGÆ\r\n\r\n\r\nWater covers two thirds of the surface of the earth, and algæ, with\r\na very few exceptions, constitute the whole vegetation which exists\r\nin that enormous area. They have, therefore, an important part to\r\nperform in the economy of nature. Algæ do not, like land plants,\r\nderive their nourishment from the soil to which they are attached,\r\nbut from substances held in solution by water. In their growth they\r\neffect changes in the water analogous to those effected by land\r\nplants in the air; that is, they change so-called impurities in the\r\nwater into materials essential to animal life. The function of plants\r\nis that of transforming or manufacturing inorganic matter, which they\r\nassimilate, into organic matter (such as starch, albumen, sugar),\r\nwhich forms their own structure and which is the food essential to\r\nanimals. In this process, plants inhale carbonic acid gas which\r\nanimals breathe out, and exhale oxygen which animals breathe in.\r\nPlants feed on mineral substances and furnish vegetable food, thus\r\nkeeping up the balance of life.\r\n\r\nFresh-water algæ have a like economic value. The green surface on\r\nstagnant pools is a vegetable growth whose function is to assimilate\r\nthe matter which makes the pool offensive. A submerged district soon\r\nbecomes covered with scum, or minute plants (/Sphæoplea annulina/),\r\nwhich grow with great rapidity, using up the materials of the\r\ndecaying vegetation, and in great measure counteracting the ill\r\neffects, in the atmosphere, of such decay. When the waters subside,\r\nthe plants shrivel up and appear like thin paper covering the ground.\r\nThis ephemeral substance soon [pg038] disappears, without giving\r\nevidence of its nature in dust or gases, its body seeming to be a\r\nmachine which transmutes, but does not hold, the substances on which\r\nit grows.\r\n\r\nAlgæ, as has been said above, grow in definite zones, and each\r\nzone has also a definite animal life which finds there its food.\r\nDarwin says: \"In all parts of the world a rocky and partially\r\nprotected shore perhaps supports in a given space a greater number\r\nof individual animals than any other station.\" And speaking of the\r\n/Laminariaceæ/, he adds: \"I can only compare these great aquatic\r\nforests of the southern hemisphere with the terrestrial ones in the\r\nintertropical regions. Yet if in any country a forest was destroyed\r\nI do not believe nearly so many species of animals would perish as\r\nwould here from the destruction of the kelp.\" The same may be said of\r\nthe Sargasso Sea, where millions of living creatures make their home.\r\nIn every kind of marine fauna there are species which derive, if not\r\nthe whole, at least a part of their nourishment from the seaweeds.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation in the narrow boundary of the three zones is\r\npalpably inadequate to supply the needs of the animal life which\r\nexists in deeper waters. But over the broad area of the ocean\r\nthere exists a vast number of pelagic, free-floating algæ, which,\r\nalthough microscopical in size, are almost infinite in numbers.\r\nIn illustration of this it has been estimated that, although they\r\nare not especially numerous in the Sargasso Sea, yet if all the\r\nseaweed there were gathered into one mass and the free-floating\r\nalgæ into another, the bulk of the latter would exceed that of the\r\nformer. The pelagic flora consists of /Diatomaceæ/, /Protococcaceæ/,\r\n/Peridinieæ/, and others. Undoubtedly it is on these pastures that\r\nfishes feed, as well as other organisms which in turn are food for\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\n/Fucus/ and /Laminaria/ constitute the kelp from which iodine is\r\nobtained, and were at one time the source of the potash of commerce.\r\n/Fucus vesiculosus/ is a constituent of a medicine used as a cure for\r\nobesity. /Chondrus crispus/, commonly known as Irish moss, was a few\r\nyears ago generally used as an article of diet. /Porphyra vulgaris/\r\n(laver) is used by the Chinese for soups. /Rhodymenia palmata/\r\n(dulse) is an article of food in Ireland and Scotland. [pg039]\r\n/Gracilaria spinosa/ is used by birds, allied to the swallows, for\r\nmaking their nests--the edible nests found in large numbers on the\r\nislands of the Indian Archipelago, especially in the caves on the\r\nshores of Java, and gathered and sent to China, where they bring\r\nlarge prices and are used in making the famous birds'-nest soup.\r\n/Gracilaria lichenoides/, also a species of the Eastern seas, is\r\nthe source of agar-agar, a preparation used in laboratories as a\r\nculture-medium for bacteria. Fossil diatoms are ground and used for\r\npolishing-powders. Seaweeds are everywhere used by farmers on the\r\ncoasts as fertilizers. [pg040]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING AT BAR HARBOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beautiful coast of Maine is a particularly good field for\r\nshore-collecting. The rocky coast harbors the boreal fauna and flora\r\nwhich depend upon such physical conditions, and the shores at Bar\r\nHarbor are typical of those found elsewhere in northern New England.\r\nThe rocks give shelter from the beating surf, while life has exposure\r\nto the cold, pure waters of the arctic current. Everywhere along\r\nthe shore, rock pools are to be found. These are perhaps the most\r\nfascinating of all spots to the collector. They are veritable gardens\r\nof the sea, where species flourish which naturally belong to deeper\r\nwater, but which find in such pools conditions suitable to their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nAt Bar Harbor one well-known and frequently visited rock pool is\r\nfound in Anemone Cave. Entering a field at Schooner Head, one\r\nturns to the right and follows the rocky shore for two or three\r\nhundred feet. It is difficult to take this short walk without being\r\nconstantly diverted and delayed by the various attractions one meets,\r\nsuch as the tide-pools, the barnacles which in places whiten the\r\nrocks, the periwinkles, the purpura shells, and the curious algæ; but\r\nat last one arrives at a cavern under an overhanging rock. Here is a\r\nlarge tide-pool which at first sight displays only a beautiful scheme\r\nof color. It is carpeted with a bright-pink alga, /Hildenbrandtia\r\nrosea/, which incrusts the basin of the pool.\r\n\r\nInterspersed with the pink are patches of a deep-red color, having\r\na velvety appearance, which are formed by another crustaceous alga,\r\n/Petrocelis cruenta/. The water of the pool is of crystal [pg041]\r\nclearness, and as one gazes into it one object after another comes\r\ninto view, until one is filled with astonishment at the number of\r\nbeautiful objects the pool contains. The little green balls, one\r\nhalf of an inch to one inch in diameter, which look like small green\r\ntomatoes scattered on the stones, are /Leathesia difformis/, an\r\nalga which cannot be mistaken for any other. Bunches of /Corallina\r\nofficinalis/, which resembles coral, as the name indicates, are\r\nabundant. This alga should be examined with a magnifying-glass. It is\r\ncovered with calcareous matter, and its peculiar form of growth is\r\nbeautiful and interesting.\r\n\r\nThe fronds of the laminarian /Alaria esculenta/ are tiny here,\r\nwhile just outside the cave they are to be seen several feet in\r\nlength, beating against the rocks in the swash of the waves. Thorny\r\nsea-urchins (/Strongylocentrotus drobachiensis/) make green spots\r\nwhich look like tufts of moss. Yellow and green sponges in little\r\ncones are spread over small surfaces. Starfishes and ophiurans\r\nare plentiful. The /Purpura lapillus/ and /Littorina litorea/ and\r\n/rudis/ (periwinkles), so plentiful on this coast, are present. The\r\n/Mytillus/ and the /Saxicava/ and the /Acmæa testudinalis/ are also\r\nto be found. A green crab (/Carcinus mænas/) is snugly hidden in a\r\ndark nook on the shady side of the pool, and many small crustaceans\r\nscuttle away from under stones as they are lifted. The collector\r\nis always anxious for uncommon, or rather less plentiful, species,\r\nand here are found two specimens of nudibranchs, or naked mollusks,\r\n/Æolis/ and /Dendronotus/. The /Chiton ruber/, a jointed mollusk, was\r\nalso found here, and five species of sea-anemones were counted. As\r\nthis is a favorite hunting-ground, the anemones have not been left\r\nto attain full growth; but there are very many small ones which at\r\nfirst are not distinguishable, as they retract their tentacles at the\r\nslightest disturbance of the water and are then quite inconspicuous.\r\nAfter a little time of quiet watching they will be seen putting out\r\ntheir tentacles and expanding their beautiful flower-like forms.\r\nIt is useless to try to capture them uninjured, so tightly do they\r\nadhere to the rocks, and the difficulty of preserving them in an\r\nexpanded form is so great that amateur collectors had better leave\r\nthem undisturbed to beautify the pool. [pg042]\r\n\r\nIt was hard to resist robbing this rock pool, where the author in\r\nhalf an hour counted twenty different species, and finally left,\r\nfeeling that its treasures were not half discovered; but collecting\r\nshould be done elsewhere, and this pool be guarded as a gem to be\r\nadmired and not to be despoiled.\r\n\r\nThis pool in Anemone Cave, although so very attractive, is surpassed\r\nin beauty and interest by pools on Porcupine Island, at the base\r\nof the cliff. This place is somewhat difficult of access, and the\r\ntimid will not undertake the descent to it; but the enthusiastic\r\ncollector, who overlooks small obstacles, will be repaid by a visit\r\nto this spot, where all the treasures of Anemone Cave are multiplied\r\nmany times over. These pools are resplendent with large anemones,\r\nhydroids, nudibranchs, mollusks, echinoderms, crustaceans, and\r\nalgæ. /Alaria esculenta/, several feet in length, is beaten to a\r\nfringe against the rocks, and /Agarum Turneri/, the sea-colander, is\r\nalso found here, together with beautiful specimens of /Rhodymenia\r\npalmata/, which is so plentiful that it reddens the rocks.\r\n\r\nA /Metridium marginatum/, the most common sea-anemone of this coast,\r\nwas taken here which measured six inches in diameter. This creature\r\nthrew out so many of the processes used for defense that it seemed at\r\nfirst as though it were covered with some seaweed; but the worm-like\r\nmovements of these threads, which measured six inches or more in\r\nlength, soon disclosed their nature.\r\n\r\nOn the more accessible shores of Porcupine Island are found the naked\r\nmollusks (nudibranchs) /Æolis/ and /Dendronotus/. Clinging sideways\r\nto the rocks just above high-water mark are many shells of /Littorina\r\nrudis/. They are fastened to the rocks by a glutinous deposit along\r\nthe outer lip, and the peculiar exposure of the open end, as well\r\nas the position above tide-mark, indicates that this animal is\r\nundergoing transformation into a land species. /Littorina palliata/\r\nis abundant on the rockweeds (/Fucus/); some of the specimens are\r\nbanded with yellow, and all closely simulate the seaweed on which\r\nthey cling. Beautifully banded specimens of /Littorina litorea/ are\r\nalso plentiful. Among other shells which are abundant here as well as\r\nelsewhere on this coast are /Purpura lapillus/, /Acmæa testudinalis/,\r\n/Buccinum undatum/, /Mya arenaria/, and /Mytillus edulis/. [pg043]\r\n\r\nUnder the rockweeds in small pools and crevices are the polyzoans\r\n/Bugula turrita/ and /Membranipora pilosa/, and the hydroids\r\n/Sertularia pumila/ and /S. argentea/.\r\n\r\nThe seaweeds /Rhodymenia palmata/ (dulse) and /Desmarestia/ are\r\nplentiful; also beautiful worms, crustaceans, and starfishes.\r\n\r\nA very interesting beach is found a few hundred feet south of Otter\r\nCliffs, to which an easy descent is made if one follows a pathway\r\nleading to it through a grove adjacent to the drive. Here one will be\r\ninterested in the study of numerous and beautiful rock pools.\r\n\r\nSea-urchins (/Strongylocentrotus drobachiensis/) seem to carpet some\r\nof them, having the appearance of mossy tufts. Beautiful pink and\r\npurple starfishes (/Asterias vulgaris/), brittle-stars (/Ophiopholis\r\naculeata/), sea-cucumbers (/Pentacta frondosa/), sea-anemones, and\r\ncrabs are abundant. If one lifts a stone the little crustaceans\r\n/Orchestia/ and /Gammarus/ will hurry away, and very likely an\r\ninteresting worm or a nudibranch will be found. It is also most\r\ninteresting to watch the barnacles, which are below the surface,\r\nreaching out their curled, feather-like feet in regular rhythmic\r\ngrasping motions. The common mussels (/Mytillus edulis/), which in\r\nplaces blacken the shore, are beautiful under examination, and the\r\nsilky network or byssus which forms the anchorage should be observed.\r\n\r\nThe rocks are hung so plentifully with /Ascophyllum nodosum/\r\n(rockweed) that its beauty is likely to be passed over unnoticed.\r\nOn the /Ascophyllum/ is growing in tufts /Polysiphonia fastigiata/;\r\nother seaweeds, /Rhodymenia palmata/, /Chordaria flagelliformis/,\r\n/Desmarestia aculeata/, /Corallina officinalis/, and /Ceramium/, are\r\nso abundant that one forgets to value them at the moment. Higher up\r\non the beach the rocks are spotted with papery sheets, which, floated\r\nout in water, prove to be the beautiful purple /Porphyra/. A fine,\r\ndark colored, hairy scum on the rocks is /Bangia fusco-purpurea/.\r\nSometimes one finds here fronds of /Laminaria/ which have been washed\r\nashore. Various green algæ are abundant. Even if not collecting, it\r\nis well to carry a small tin pail to the beach and float out pieces\r\nof the algæ in order to observe carefully, if but for a moment, the\r\nbeautiful forms they have in their natural state. Watched for a few\r\nminutes in a pail of water animals disclose curious [pg044] and\r\nsurprising forms and habits which are difficult to watch leaning over\r\na pool.\r\n\r\nMost of the various species mentioned above are common along the\r\nwhole shore, and may be looked for at almost any point where the\r\nwater is free from contamination.\r\n\r\nAt the sand-beach are found species which do not inhabit the rocky\r\nshore, as the sand-dollar (/Echinarachnius parma/), /Polynices/\r\n(/Lunatia/) /heros/, /Mya arenaria/, and others. After a storm\r\nvarious deep-water forms are washed upon this beach. /Laminaria\r\ndigitata/, six feet long, is found here sometimes under these\r\ncircumstances. /Chordaria flagelliformis/, resembling long switches\r\nof hair, floats from the rocks near the shore. To the left, on the\r\nrock under the overhanging ledge, is a tide-pool which one would\r\nhesitate to deface by touching a single specimen. So crystal-clear\r\nis the water, so brilliant the /Hildenbrandtia/, so lovely the\r\n/Corallina/, that all seem placed there to excite admiration.\r\n\r\nBut most of all one should obtain the permission of the owner to\r\nvisit Rodicks Weir. Here is an immense natural aquarium, full of\r\nliving wonders. On a clear day, sunlight penetrates to the bottom,\r\nand at low tide the whole contents of the weir are clearly seen as\r\none floats through the inclosed water-spaces. On the bottom are\r\nsea-urchins, many of them with sticks or stones on their backs, which\r\nthe animals have placed there in the endeavor to conceal themselves;\r\nstarfishes feeding; and great numbers of whelks (/Buccinum undatum/).\r\nCuttlefishes dart rapidly about, and skates, sculpins, and other\r\nfishes display their curious forms. Very likely a giant jellyfish\r\n(/Cyanea arctica/) is entangled in the brush, so that one can examine\r\nat short range its wonderful and beautiful parts. Other jellyfishes\r\nmay be closely scrutinized.\r\n\r\nThe alga /Polysiphonia violacea/ floats in long feathery tufts from\r\nthe stakes.\r\n\r\nOn the eel-grass are to be found /Lacuna vincta/ and the delicate\r\niridescent little shells of /Margarita helicina/.\r\n\r\nEvery tide brings different species of the ocean fauna to temporary\r\nimprisonment in this inclosure, so that it is difficult to say what\r\none may not chance to find in this interesting place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nMARINE ALGÆ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEAWEED\r\n\r\n\r\n  When descends on the Atlantic\r\n        The gigantic\r\n  Storm-wind of the equinox,\r\n  Landward in his wrath he scourges\r\n        The toiling surges,\r\n  Laden with seaweed from the rocks;\r\n\r\n  From Bermuda's reefs; from edges\r\n        Of sunken ledges\r\n  In some far-off, bright Azore;\r\n  From Bahama and the dashing,\r\n        Silver-flashing\r\n  Surges of San Salvador;\r\n\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Ever drifting, drifting, drifting\r\n        On the shifting\r\n  Currents of the restless main;\r\n  Till in sheltered coves, and reaches\r\n        Of sandy beaches,\r\n  All have found repose again.\r\n\r\n  LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nBLUE-GREEN SEAWEEDS (CYANOPHYCEÆ)\r\n\r\nGRASS-GREEN SEAWEEDS (CHLOROPHYCEÆ)\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE BLUE-GREEN SEAWEEDS DESCRIBED\r\nIN THIS CHAPTER\r\n\r\n  Class =ALGÆ=\r\n\r\n    Subclass =Cyanophyceæ= (/Blue-Green Seaweeds/)\r\n\r\n     Order =NOSTOCACEÆ=\r\n\r\n       Genera              Species\r\n\r\n       ^Spirulina^\r\n       ^Oscillaria^\r\n       ^Calothrix^\r\n       ^Lyngbya^          ^L. majuscula^\r\n                          ^L. ferruginea^\r\n\r\n\r\n[pg049]\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE-GREEN SEAWEEDS\r\n\r\nThe minute algæ, which form patches of purple color on rocks, slimy\r\nlayers or spots on wharves, bluish-green slime on mud, emerald-green\r\nfilms on decaying algæ, blue-green slime on brackish ditches, and so\r\non, are various species of the subclass =Cyanophyceæ=. The prevailing\r\ncolor of these plants is blue-green, but some are purple, brown, or\r\npink. Some of them are gelatinous in texture and shapeless, others\r\nhave more definite forms; but all are too small to classify without\r\nthe aid of a powerful glass, and are not of special interest except\r\nto the botanist.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERA ^Oscillaria^ and ^Spirulina^\r\n\r\nThe genus ^Oscillaria^ is so named from an oscillating movement which\r\nthese filamentous plants show when viewed under the microscope. They\r\nare very delicate blue-green threads occurring singly, or in loose or\r\nfelt-like floating masses, or like slime or scum, on mud or woodwork.\r\nIn ^Spirulina^ the filaments are spirally twisted like a corkscrew\r\nand also have a vibrating movement. /Spirulina/ is often found\r\ngrowing with /Oscillaria/, and forms purple patches on wharves.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Calothrix^\r\n\r\n(\"/Beautiful hair/\")\r\n\r\nFilaments one tenth of an inch long, terminating in transparent\r\nhair-like points, occasionally branching. The plant grows in fine\r\ntufts or like a fringe on algæ or in patches on rocks. Sometimes it\r\nforms a spongy layer, again a velvety stratum. The color varies in\r\ndifferent species; it may be bright green, brownish-green, [pg050]\r\nor dark bluish-purple. The genus is very common, and the plants are\r\noften found on the bottoms of boats.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Lyngbya^\r\n\r\n(/Named for Hans Christian Lyngbye, a Danish botanist/)\r\n\r\n  ^L. majuscula^, mermaid's-hair. The filaments are curled or\r\n  crisped, long, thick, and tenacious, matted together at the base,\r\n  and blackish-green. The species grows in tufts on eel-grass and\r\n  algæ, and is often found floating free. It is common in summer\r\n  everywhere south of Cape Cod and on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\n  ^L. ferruginea^ or ^æstuarii^. In this species the filaments are\r\n  thin, soft, and without stability (flaccid), so that they lie flat\r\n  like a thin stratum.

The green algæ are among the most widely diffused\r\nof plant forms. They grow practically in every place where enough\r\nmoisture, together with light and air, is to be had. Between\r\ntide-marks on almost every coast, floating on the surface of the deep\r\nsea, covering damp earth, walls, palings, and tree-trunks, sticking\r\nto the surface of leaves in the moist atmosphere of tropical forests\r\nand jungles, and inhabiting almost every river, brook, pond, ditch,\r\nor casual pool of rain-water in all quarters of the globe, are\r\nmembers of this ubiquitous group to be found.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Kerner.]\r\n\r\nThe grass-green seaweeds are more simple in structure, and therefore\r\nare lower in order, than the red or brown algæ. They are among the\r\nlowest of all plants, many of them being minute single cells. They\r\nabound in fresh as well as in salt water, and in this respect differ\r\nfrom the other groups, the red and the brown algæ being almost\r\nexclusively marine plants.\r\n\r\nAs one approaches the shore, the attention is often attracted by the\r\ngreen mantle which covers everything overflowed by the tides. This\r\nconsists largely of the confervoid algæ, which are very abundant and\r\nare found almost everywhere. They are dense tufts of fine thread-like\r\nplants, often matted at the base; sometimes they are sponge-like,\r\nfloating masses.\r\n\r\nThe =Ulvaceæ=, the plants next higher in order, are the first which\r\nassume ribbon- and leaf-like expansions, and usually first engage the\r\nattention of the collector. [pg053]\r\n\r\nIn the green algæ are found the extreme forms of one-celled plants.\r\nIn ^Pleurococcus^ the cell is microscopic in size. In the =Siphoneæ=\r\nthe plant still consists of a single cell, but it attains large\r\ndimensions and develops into forms resembling, in outward appearance,\r\nleaf, stem, and root (see /Caulerpa/).\r\n\r\nOther plants consist of single rows of cells, called filaments\r\n(=Confervaceæ=), or of cells arranged in layers or flat surfaces,\r\ncalled membranes (=Ulvaceæ=).\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =CONFERVACEÆ=\r\n\r\nThe silkweeds. This order is characterized by cylindrical cells\r\nstrung end to end, forming threads or filaments, branched and\r\nunbranched. The plants inhabit both fresh and salt water, and are\r\nvery abundant and widely distributed. They grow in dense tufts, often\r\nmatted at the base.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ulothrix^\r\n\r\nA yellow-green, unbranched, decumbent, soft, hair-like fleece on the\r\nsurface of rocks, extending indefinitely. This genus differs from\r\n/Chætomorpha/ in the character of its filaments, which are soft and\r\ngelatinous in ^Ulothrix^, but bristle-like and wiry in /Chætomorpha/.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Chætomorpha^\r\n\r\nThe frond is filiform; the filaments are coarse, rigid, and\r\nunbranched. In some species the filaments grow straight and in\r\ntufts from a definite base; in others they are twisted together\r\nand are prostrate. Often they are found floating in masses. In ^C.\r\ntortuosa^ the filaments are as fine as human hair, but rigid, and so\r\nclosely interwoven as to resemble a layer of wool on the rocks. The\r\ncell-divisions give a striped appearance to the filaments when dry.\r\n\r\n  ^C. melagonium.^ This species is dark green, with filaments erect,\r\n  coarse as a double bristle, and wiry; five to twelve inches long.\r\n  It is found in rock pools from Boston northward. It does not adhere\r\n  to paper in drying, and loses its color if immersed in fresh water.\r\n  (Plate III.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. ærea.^ Yellowish-green, with filaments erect and less rigid\r\n  than [pg054] in /C. melagonium/, which it otherwise resembles;\r\n  tufts three to twelve inches long; cell-divisions very marked. This\r\n  species is found in rock pools from Cape Cod to New York Bay.\r\n\r\n  ^C. linum.^ Bright green; filaments coarse, rigid, twisted\r\n  together, and prostrate. It is found floating in masses and forming\r\n  strata on rocks and gravel from New York northward. It is thought\r\n  by some that this, as well as ^C. picquotiana^, which it closely\r\n  resembles, is not a true species, but consists of the mature plants\r\n  of the species /C. melagonium/ and /C. ærea/, which have become\r\n  detached from their holdfasts and have continued to grow. (Plate\r\n  III.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cladophora^\r\n\r\n(\"/Branch-bearing/\")\r\n\r\nFrond filiform, branched. There are many species of ^Cladophora^,\r\nwhich differ from one another in their branching, color, and size.\r\nThey abound on rocks at low-water mark, in tide-pools, in muddy\r\nditches, and on wharves. They are especially characterized by being\r\nso profusely branched as to form tufts or spherical masses, by which\r\nthe collector can easily distinguish the genus.\r\n\r\n  ^C. arcta.^ Bright, glossy green; filaments fine, erect, much\r\n  branched, two to eight inches long; tufts dense, more or less\r\n  entangled, and in bunches, giving a starry effect. The species is\r\n  common on rocks near low-water mark from New York northward. The\r\n  plants vary slightly in appearance with the season. (Plate III.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. rupestris.^ Dark green; filaments straight, rigid, tufted;\r\n  branches crowded; many branchlets flattened against the filaments,\r\n  so that the alga somewhat resembles grass; five to ten inches long.\r\n  The cell-divisions show plainly. Plants of this species do not\r\n  adhere to paper in drying. They are found on rocks at low-water\r\n  mark, and are common on the northern New England coast. (Plate III.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. gracilis.^ Bright yellow-green; filaments very fine, loosely\r\n  tufted, three to twelve inches long, soft, silky, much branched;\r\n  branches rather short, and branchlets more or less curved and\r\n  arranged in a comb-like manner. It grows on wharves, in muddy\r\n  pools, and on eel-grass. (Plate IV.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III. Chætomorpha melagonium. Chætomorpha linum.\r\nCladophora arcta.

Enteromorpha clathrata.]\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =ULVACEÆ=\r\n\r\nThe plants of this order are, with few exceptions, formed of celled\r\nsurfaces and show the earliest type of an expanded leaf. The cells\r\nform thin membranes, which sometimes are broad surfaces of no\r\ndefinite shape, sometimes are narrow and ribbon-like, or they may be\r\nsimple or branched tubes. When the membrane [pg055] consists of\r\na single layer of cells it is ^Monostroma^ (\"one layer\"); when it\r\nconsists of a double layer it is ^Ulva^; when the layers separate,\r\nthe thallus becomes hollow, and it is then ^Enteromorpha^. These\r\nplants are mostly a brilliant grass-green in color, are silky in\r\ntexture, and are attached by a small disk to rocks and stones. They\r\nabound everywhere, and are commonly known as /green laver/.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ulva^\r\n\r\nFrond a thin, silky, flat membrane, sometimes leaf-like, again an\r\nextended surface of no definite shape. These are the largest green\r\nalgæ. They are common everywhere.\r\n\r\n  ^U. lactuca^, the sea-lettuce. Frond a flat membrane of various\r\n  shapes, sometimes orbicular, again deeply incised, often\r\n  ribbon-like; margin always much waved or ruffled. In the variety\r\n  ^rigida^ the frond is oval in outline, not very large, and quite\r\n  firm or rigid. The species is found on rocks exposed to the action\r\n  of the waves. (Plate IV.)\r\n\r\n  ^U. latissima.^ Frond a flat, expanded membrane of indefinite\r\n  shape, but general outline oval, never ribbon-like; attains a\r\n  size of twelve to twenty-four inches; often deeply lobed, very\r\n  waved, often perforated with holes; membrane brilliant green,\r\n  thin, smooth, glossy. It grows apart or in tufts, and is found\r\n  everywhere, in all stages of growth. It is the largest species of\r\n  /Ulva/, and is very common on muddy shores.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Enteromorpha^\r\n\r\nFronds tubular, simple or branched, sometimes inflated. The tubes\r\nvary in size in different species and also in the same species, some\r\nbeing fine like a hair, others large, and flat or inflated. The genus\r\nis widely distributed and very abundant. Species of ^Enteromorpha^\r\ngrow on the bottoms of ships, and in nautical language are called\r\n/grass/.\r\n\r\n  ^E. clathrata.^ Fronds thread-like, tubular, branched, and branches\r\n  beset with numerous fine branchlets; densely tufted, soft. Common\r\n  everywhere. (Plate IV.)\r\n\r\n  ^E. compressa.^ Fronds long, slender, branched, tufted; branches\r\n  simple, compressed, extending from main central branch, obtuse\r\n  at ends, but attenuated at base. The species is very abundant\r\n  everywhere, and is a useful plant for the aquarium. (Plate V.)\r\n\r\n  ^E. intestinalis.^ Single, long, inflated tubes or sacs, obtuse at\r\n  the apex, very attenuated at the base; fronds often crimped and\r\n  twisted, resembling an intestine, whence the name. (Plate V.)\r\n  [pg056]\r\n\r\n  ^E. lanceolata.^ Formerly called /Ulva Linza/. Frond narrow,\r\n  ribbon-like, six to twelve inches long, one inch to two inches\r\n  wide; blunt or pointed at apex, tapering at base; attached by a\r\n  disk; edges much ruffled; bright green, soft, thin.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Monostroma^\r\n\r\nThis genus resembles /Ulva/, but is more delicate since it\r\nhas but one layer of cells, as its name implies. The frond is\r\nusually sac-like at first, then breaks apart, leaving a thin,\r\nsemi-transparent membrane of no definite shape.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP =SIPHONEÆ=\r\n\r\nThe distinct and peculiar character of this group is that in each\r\nindividual the whole plant consists of but one cell. There are many\r\ngenera, some of which are plants of elaborate form and considerable\r\nsize, but always the one cell expands and branches without dividing\r\nthe elongated cavity with septa, or plates of division. In ^Caulerpa^\r\nthe stability of the plant is secured by numerous fibrils which\r\nemanate from the interior of the cell, forming a spongy network of\r\ninterlacing filaments. In other orders the branches gain support from\r\nincrustation, from interlacing, and from cohering on the edges.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =VALONIACEÆ=\r\n\r\nThe algæ of this order are found only in tropical or subtropical\r\nwaters. Their holdfasts resemble fibrous roots and penetrate the sand\r\nor coral on which they grow.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Chamædoris^\r\n\r\n  ^C. annulata.^ When young this alga consists of an annulated tube\r\n  formed of a single cell. The annular constrictions occur at short\r\n  intervals, giving it the appearance of being jointed. It grows to\r\n  the height of two to three inches, when it ceases to lengthen and\r\n  produces a dense mass of filaments, forming a head or spherical\r\n  tuft one inch or more in diameter. It is bright grass-green in\r\n  color, rather rigid and tough, and when mature is thinly coated\r\n  with carbonate of lime. The holdfast is a tuft of fibers. The\r\n  species is found at Key West and is a native of the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V. Enteromorpha compressa. Enteromorpha\r\nintestinalis. Enteromorpha intestinalis. Anadyomene flabellata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI. Acetabularia crenulata. Dasycladus\r\noccidentalis. Penicillus dumentosus. Udotea conglutinata.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Anadyomene^\r\n\r\n  ^A. flabellata.^ Frond composed entirely of branching filaments,\r\n  which unite and form an undulating, rigid membranaceous surface,\r\n  which seems like a network of veins. The species grows in bunches\r\n  on short stems in the fissures of tidal rocks, and at first view\r\n  resembles young /Ulva/. It is a very curious and beautiful alga,\r\n  and should be examined with a glass. It is one inch to four inches\r\n  in diameter when full-grown. (Plate V.)\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =DASYCLADACEÆ=\r\n\r\nThis order also inhabits only tropical or subtropical seas. It is\r\nplaced in this group, although only the main axis is unicellular.\r\nThe one-celled axis is surmounted or encircled by whorls of minute\r\nfilaments or branchlets (/ramuli/), which protrude through small\r\nholes and are either persistent or deciduous. In the latter case the\r\nfallen filaments leave disk-like scars on the stem.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Acetabularia^\r\n\r\n  ^A. crenulata.^ This little alga resembles a mushroom of the\r\n  /Agaricus/ variety or gilled species, and so is easily identified.\r\n  It is thinly incrusted with lime and is found on rocks and coral,\r\n  within tide-marks, on the Florida reefs. When full-grown the stipe\r\n  is two to three inches long and the cap one half of an inch in\r\n  diameter. (Plate VI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Dasycladus^\r\n\r\nFronds destitute of calcareous matter, soft, cylindrical or\r\nclub-shaped; single unicellular axis, beset with fine filaments or\r\nramuli.\r\n\r\n  ^D. occidentalis.^ Frond club-shaped, one to two inches high, one\r\n  half of an inch or less in diameter; covered with whorls of fine\r\n  filaments, making the fronds almost spongy; substance soft but\r\n  tough; dark green. These plants have been compared to foxes' tails.\r\n  They grow in bunches on rocks between tide-marks. (Plate VI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cymopolia^\r\n\r\n  ^C. barbata.^ Frond branched, dividing regularly in pairs; thickly\r\n  incrusted with lime. Annular constrictions at short intervals give\r\n  the branches the appearance of strings of beads. Each section\r\n  is covered with pores or scars of fallen ramuli. The branches\r\n  terminate in tufts of fine filaments. [pg058]\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =UDOTEACEÆ=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Penicillus^\r\n\r\nThe merman's shaving-brush, characteristic of coral reefs.\r\n\r\n  ^P. dumentosus.^ Holdfast much branched, like a fibrous root, and\r\n  penetrating deep into the coral or sand; stem short, thick, more\r\n  or less flattened, sometimes hollow, covered with velvety scurf;\r\n  top covered with loosely spreading tuft of soft filaments three to\r\n  six inches long, which branch repeatedly in pairs (dichotomous);\r\n  color deep green. When old, these plants are incrusted with a thin,\r\n  porous layer of carbonate of lime. (Plate VI.)\r\n\r\n  ^P. capitatus.^ Holdfast a dense mass of fibers two or more inches\r\n  long; stipe one to five inches long, one fourth to one third of an\r\n  inch in diameter, usually cylindrical, sometimes wider at top than\r\n  at base, sometimes flattened; thickly incrusted with lime, which is\r\n  smooth and often polished; top a dense, spherical mass of filaments\r\n  one to two inches in diameter; filaments branching dichotomously,\r\n  and rigid from incrustation of lime.\r\n\r\n  ^P. Ph[oe]nix.^ Stipe cylindrical, one to three inches long,\r\n  one fourth of an inch in diameter, thickly incrusted with lime,\r\n  smooth; capitulum or head ovoid, and composed of filaments which\r\n  are incrusted with lime and coherent, forming many distinct, flat,\r\n  wedge-shaped, level-topped, spreading laminæ. This species is found\r\n  at Key West.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Udotea^\r\n\r\n  ^U. flabellata.^ Short, flattened stem, expanding into a broad,\r\n  fan-shaped, smooth frond, concentrically zoned; margin wavy;\r\n  thickly incrusted with lime. Abundant at Key West.\r\n\r\n  ^U. conglutinata.^ Deeply descending root; stem expanding into\r\n  fan-shaped frond; entire, lobed, or irregularly torn; slightly\r\n  incrusted with lime. The frond is composed of longitudinally\r\n  parallel, adherent filaments, which are visible, giving a striated,\r\n  rough surface. (Plate VI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Halimeda^\r\n\r\nThis genus resembles the corallines externally, and is abundant on\r\ncoral reefs. It appears as if formed of separate parts, resembling\r\na series of heart- or kidney-shaped segments strung together. The\r\nplants are more or less incrusted with lime. The branching holdfast\r\ngrasps particles of sand, and with them forms a solid ball.\r\n\r\n  ^H. tuna.^ Articulations roundish or half kidney-shaped, one half\r\n  to three quarters of an inch broad; frond flat, smooth, and thinner\r\n  than most species; bright green; somewhat flexible. (Plate VII.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII. Halimeda tuna. Halimeda tridens. Bryopsis\r\nplumosa. Codium tomentosum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII. Caulerpa Mexicana. Caulerpa Wurdemanii.\r\nCaulerpa plumaris. Caulerpa paspaloides.]\r\n\r\n  ^H. tridens.^ Fronds solitary, erect; base composed of\r\n  confluent articulations; above divided into numerous branches\r\n  of articulations, which are all flat, and in one plane giving a\r\n  fan-shaped outline; middle joints wedge-shaped; upper ones divided\r\n  into three lobes, frequently bearing articulations at the summit of\r\n  each lobe; thinly incrusted with lime; color bright green. (Plate\r\n  VII.)\r\n\r\n  ^H. opuntia.^ Articulations kidney-shaped, flat, rather thin;\r\n  margins scalloped; irregularly branched and spreading; dense tufts.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =CODIACEÆ=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Bryopsis^\r\n\r\n(\"/Moss-like/\")\r\n\r\nThere are said to be about twenty species of this genus. They are\r\ndistinguished by the manner of branching, but are not very definitely\r\nmarked. All are erect, one-celled, branching stalks, and are\r\nfeather-like in appearance.\r\n\r\n  ^B. plumosa.^ Fronds branched twice or more; branchlets or pinnules\r\n  tapering as they rise on the stalk, giving a triangular outline;\r\n  stalk naked below; plants a vivid dark green in color, two to six\r\n  inches long, growing in tufts on wharves and stones at low-water\r\n  mark and in tide-pools. It is common along the whole Atlantic and\r\n  Pacific coasts. It is well to use salt water for mounting this\r\n  alga, since the green coloring-matter or granular endochrome with\r\n  which it is filled easily escapes. (Plate VII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Codium^\r\n\r\n  ^C. tomentosum.^ This is called the commonest seaweed in the world.\r\n  It is abundant in every latitude, yet it does not appear on the\r\n  eastern coast of North America. It is found on the gulf coast of\r\n  Florida and is plentiful on the Pacific coast. The fronds are often\r\n  a foot long, composed of closely packed, club-shaped branches\r\n  dividing in a forking manner, and densely covered with fine\r\n  filaments which give them a soft, sponge-like texture. (Plate VII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =CAULERPACEÆ=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Caulerpa^\r\n\r\n(/From two Greek words meaning \"stem\" and \"creep\"/)\r\n\r\n/Caulerpa/ is the only genus of its order, but it contains about a\r\nhundred species, many of which resemble mosses, ferns, or cacti. Each\r\nplant is composed of a single cell, however much it may be [pg060]\r\nramified. The frond consists of a prostrate stem, from the lower side\r\nof which root-like fibers or holdfasts descend into the hard sand or\r\ncoral, and from the upper side leaf- and branch-like secondary fronds\r\narise. These plants grow luxuriantly in tropical waters, extending\r\nover large surfaces, and are the chief food of turtles. (Plate VIII.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. prolifera.^ Frond or lamina flat and leaf-like, two to four\r\n  inches long, one half to three quarters of an inch wide, either\r\n  simple or once forked; margin entire. Similar laminæ spring from\r\n  the surface or from the edge or base of the different leaf-like\r\n  portions. Laminæ rise from the upper side of the creeping, rooting\r\n  stem. Its substance is somewhat horny and translucent.\r\n\r\n  ^C.

Since these differences are not perceptible to the\r\nnaked eye, it is impracticable to describe many species, or for the\r\namateur collector to try to separate them.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ectocarpus^\r\n\r\n  ^E. littoralis.^ Filaments fine, in dense tufts, interwoven, six to\r\n  twelve inches long; pod linear in the substance of the branches;\r\n  color olive-green. This is the most common species of /Ectocarpus/,\r\n  and grows abundantly everywhere, appearing like large, fine,\r\n  dull-green plumes. (Plate IX.) [pg065]\r\n\r\n  ^E. siliculosus.^ Tufts loosely entangled at the base, free and\r\n  feathery above, of indefinite length; spores in pod-like forms at\r\n  the ends of the branches. Common on the larger algæ and on wharves.\r\n\r\n  ^E. viridis.^ Tufts a little more loose and expanding than in /E.\r\n  siliculosus/; spores in pods at the base of the branches. (Plate\r\n  IX.)\r\n\r\n  ^E. tomentosus.^ Fine filaments, densely interwoven into rope-like,\r\n  spongy masses, two to four inches long; yellowish-brown; pods on\r\n  stalks. Found in summer growing on /Fucus/.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =SPHACELARIACEÆ=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Sphacelaria^\r\n\r\n  ^S. cirrhosa.^ Olive-brown; branched, feathery filaments, one\r\n  half of an inch to two inches long. Each branch ends with an\r\n  oblong, swollen cell containing a dark granular mass which gives\r\n  it a withered appearance. These cells can be seen with a strong\r\n  pocket-lens. It forms dense, globe-like tufts on /Fucus/.\r\n\r\n  ^S. radicans.^ Filaments one half of an inch to one inch high;\r\n  branches few and hairy. It forms a dense, grass-like covering, of\r\n  indefinite extent, on the under side of muddy rocks. Found on the\r\n  New England coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cladostephus^\r\n\r\n  ^C. verticillatus.^ Fronds bristle-like, dividing regularly;\r\n  covered with whorls of branchlets set close to the stems, each\r\n  whorl overlapping the previous one, giving the plant a spongy\r\n  appearance. (Plate IX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =RALFSIACEÆ=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ralfsia^\r\n\r\nThe species of this genus are brown, leathery, crustaceous expansions\r\nof indefinite form, one inch to six inches in diameter, resembling\r\nlichens. They appear on rocks in shallow, exposed pools.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =ENC[OE]LIACEÆ=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Punctaria^\r\n\r\nDotted-weeds. Fronds pale olive-green, membranaceous, leaf-like, with\r\nshort stem; covered with spores which appear like dots.\r\n\r\n  ^P. latifolia.^ Frond pale green, four to twelve inches long, one\r\n  inch to five inches wide, leaf-like, and tapering suddenly to a\r\n  short stalk; much [pg066] waved on margin; substance soft and\r\n  thin; dotted with spores. In the young plants fine hairs emerge\r\n  from the dots, but disappear later, and the fronds become darker\r\n  and more rigid. Found in summer on rocks and on other algæ on the\r\n  Long Island and New England coasts.\r\n\r\n  ^P. tenuissima.^ Fronds smaller and more slender than in /P.\r\n  latifolia/; thin and delicate. Found on eel-grass and /Chorda\r\n  filum/.\r\n\r\n  ^P. plantaginea.^ Fronds dark brown, leathery, leaf-like, blunt or\r\n  wedge-shaped on top; dense clusters of hairs on the dots; six to\r\n  twelve inches long, one inch to one and a half inches wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Asperococcus^\r\n\r\nThis genus differs from /Punctaria/ in having a tubular instead of a\r\nflat frond. (Plate IX.)\r\n\r\n  ^A. echinatus.^ Resembles /Enteromorpha/ in being tubular;\r\n  compressed or inflated; obtuse at the apex; attenuated at the\r\n  base. It differs from /Enteromorpha/ in being olive in color, and\r\n  in being covered with small oblong dots of darker shade. When the\r\n  plant is young the dots are hairy. It grows in clusters, two to\r\n  eighteen inches long, one half of an inch to one inch wide. Common\r\n  along the New England coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Phyllitis^\r\n\r\n  ^P. fascia.^ Fronds light olive-green, leaf-like, three to six\r\n  inches long, one fourth to one half of an inch wide; margin entire,\r\n  slightly waved; contracted at base to short stalk; attached\r\n  by disk. This species grows in bunches on rocks and stones at\r\n  low-water mark, and is very common everywhere. (Plate X.)\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =DESMARESTIACEÆ=\r\n\r\n(/Named for M. Desmarest, a French naturalist/)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Desmarestia^\r\n\r\n  ^D. viridis.^ Filaments cylindrical, about as thick as a bristle;\r\n  branches opposite, in pairs, at intervals on the main stem. The\r\n  branches branch again and continue to be disposed in the same\r\n  manner. All are long and ultimately become very fine. The color is\r\n  olive-green, becoming verdigris-green when exposed to the air for\r\n  a short time or placed in fresh water. The species grows in deep\r\n  tide-pools and below low-water mark, forming fine, feathery plumes,\r\n  often a yard long, which give submerged rocks the appearance of a\r\n  luxuriant garden. (Plate X.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE IX. Ectocarpus littoralis. Ectocarpus viridis.\r\n  Cladostephus verticillatus. Asperococcus bullosus.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE X. Phyllitis fascia. Desmarestia viridis.\r\n  Desmarestia aculeata. Desmarestia ligulata.]\r\n\r\n  ^D. aculeata^ (\"spiny\"). Fronds cylindrical at base, flattened\r\n  above; branches long and straight, arranged alternately, when young\r\n  beset with pencils of fine hairs, often one half of an inch long,\r\n  which, later, fall off, leaving alternate spines along the edges of\r\n  the flattened branches. It [pg067] grows from one foot to six\r\n  feet in length, below low-water mark, and is found washed ashore.\r\n  It is an attractive plant in the spring, but is brown and coarse\r\n  when old. Common everywhere. (Plate X.)\r\n\r\n  ^D. ligulata.^ Fronds two to six feet long, pinnate, having a\r\n  flat main stem one half of an inch or more wide, with opposite\r\n  flat branches; leaflets arranged along the edges of the branches,\r\n  pointed at each end, and bordered with forward-pointing spines. It\r\n  is found washed ashore, in abundance, in California, but is not\r\n  found on the Atlantic coast. (Plate X.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Arthrocladia^\r\n\r\n  ^A. villosa.^ Olive-brown filaments, resembling fine, knotted\r\n  threads, each knob having a whorl of delicate filaments. It grows\r\n  from six inches to three feet long, in deep water. It is rare, but\r\n  is occasionally found on the New England coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =DICTYOSIPHONACEÆ=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Dictyosiphon^\r\n\r\n  ^D. f[oe]niculaceus.^ Fronds filiform, bristle-like, branching\r\n  into delicate, hair-like branches; yellowish-brown. It resembles\r\n  /Chordaria flagelliformis/, but is much finer. (Plate XI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =ELACHISTACEÆ=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Elachista^\r\n\r\nThe plants of this genus are small, olive-colored, unbranched,\r\nhair-like filaments, growing in dense, radiating tufts, one half\r\nof an inch in height, on /Fucus/. They are interesting to the\r\nmicroscopist, but not to the collector.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =CHORDARIACEÆ=\r\n\r\n(\"/Cord-like/\")\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Chordaria^\r\n\r\n  ^C. flagelliformis^ (\"whip-like\"). Firm, leathery, somewhat\r\n  elastic, slimy strings, six to twenty-four inches long, and twice\r\n  as thick as a bristle; branches mostly undivided, short or long,\r\n  irregularly placed on the main axis, and curving inward at the\r\n  top of the frond; main axis not extending as far as the branches;\r\n  blackish in color; attached by a disk to stones and shells;\r\n  solitary or in bunches. It is common along the New England coast.\r\n  (Plate XI.) [pg068]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Mesogl[oe]a^\r\n\r\n  ^M. virescens.^ Soft, slimy filaments, with branches and\r\n  branchlets; olive-green. (Plate XI.)\r\n\r\n  ^M. divaricata.^ Fronds two to twenty-four inches high; branching\r\n  irregularly, and generally without definite main axis; branches\r\n  flexuous, solid at first, later hollow; branchlets short and\r\n  wide-spreading. Common from Cape Cod southward; abundant in Long\r\n  Island Sound. (Plate XI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Leathesia^\r\n\r\nThis singular alga resembles a tuber and cannot be mistaken for any\r\nother plant. Its fronds are gelatinous, fleshy balls, one half of an\r\ninch to two inches in diameter, at first solid, afterward lobed and\r\nhollow. It grows singly or in bunches on algæ and on sand-covered\r\nrocks, and is found in summer on every coast. The common species is\r\nknown as /L. difformis/ or /L. tuberiformis/.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Myrionema^\r\n\r\nMinute algæ which grow on other plants and which appear like dark\r\nspots, or, at first, like stains, on /Ulva/, /Enteromorpha/, and\r\nsmall red algæ. These spots, which to the naked eye appear like\r\ndecay, show, under the microscope, a jelly-like substance full of\r\nbeaded filaments.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =LAMINARIACEÆ=\r\n\r\nThe plants of this order have large and coarse fronds (some\r\nattaining an immense size), with stems, branching root-like\r\nholdfasts, and expanded leaf-like laminæ. They are leather-like, not\r\narticulated, olive-green or brown in color, and sometimes yellow\r\nand semi-transparent. They grow in deep water and are found washed\r\nashore. Sometimes small plants are found in deep tide-pools at\r\nlow-water mark. Some species are perennial. In these instances the\r\nstems only survive, and the laminæ are reproduced annually. The new\r\ngrowth takes place at the apex of the stem. The old lamina is pushed\r\noff, but is held on the summit of the new growth until the latter has\r\nmatured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI. Dictyosiphon f[oe]niculaceus. Chordaria\r\nflagelliformis. Mesogl[oe]a virescens. Mesogl[oe]a divaricata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII. Chorda filum. Agarum Turneri. Alaria\r\nesculenta. Laminaria saccharina.]\r\n\r\nIn the genus /Chorda/ the fronds are cylindrical; in /Agarum/\r\n[pg069] the laminæ are perforated; in /Alaria/ there are wing-like\r\nleaflets below the laminæ.\r\n\r\nThe /Laminariaceæ/ and /Fucaceæ/ are the seaweeds used in making\r\nkelp. For this the algæ are burned, and the ash is then separated\r\ninto its different mineral constituents and used for various\r\nmanufacturing purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Chorda^\r\n\r\n  ^C. filum.^ Entire frond cylindrical, divided internally by\r\n  transverse septa; one fourth to one half of an inch in diameter,\r\n  tapering at each end; ordinarily one to twelve feet long, but\r\n  sometimes attaining a length of forty feet. When young the frond\r\n  is covered with fine, transparent hairs; later it is brown and\r\n  leather-like. The growth takes place at the base, just above the\r\n  disk-like holdfast, and at the apex it is constantly dying off. The\r\n  species is common on Northern shores, at and below low-water mark.\r\n  Often it is in masses which seem like meadows of waving grass under\r\n  water. Various small algæ and many zoöphytes are to be found on the\r\n  fronds. (Plate XII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Alaria^\r\n\r\nThis genus is readily distinguishable by the fact that it has\r\nleaflets below the lamina. It is found north of Cape Cod.\r\n\r\n  ^A. esculenta.^ Stem compressed, four to twelve inches long, one\r\n  fourth to one half of an inch wide, and running like a midrib\r\n  through the lamina; lamina one to ten feet long, two to ten inches\r\n  wide, frequently torn and ragged; margin wavy; leaflets three to\r\n  eight inches long and without midrib, growing on both sides of the\r\n  stem, below the lamina. The spores are produced in the leaflets in\r\n  the autumn. This is an edible alga and is used as food in Scotland\r\n  and Ireland, where it is called henware, badderlocks, murlins, and\r\n  so on. (Plate XII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Agarum^\r\n\r\nThe sea-colanders.\r\n\r\n  ^A. Turneri.^ Stem two to twelve inches long, round below,\r\n  flattened above, and extending like a midrib through the lamina;\r\n  lamina one foot to four feet long, with holes over the whole\r\n  surface; margin wavy. The perforations in the lamina are produced\r\n  by conical hollow papillæ which cover the young frond and which at\r\n  length burst, leaving a hole which enlarges as the plant expands.\r\n  This species is found from Cape Cod to Greenland.\r\n\r\n  There are other species, which differ from this one in the size of\r\n  the perforations, the shape of the lamina, and the prominence of\r\n  the midrib. Harvey describes the plant as an arctic genus growing\r\n  ten to twelve feet long. (Plate XII.) [pg070]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Laminaria^\r\n\r\nThe plants of this genus are all large, varying from one foot to\r\ntwelve feet or more in length. They are of wide geographical range,\r\nand are more numerous in species than any others of the order. They\r\nare commonly known as oarweeds, tangle, devil's-aprons, sole-leather,\r\nkelp, sea-furbelows, and so on.\r\n\r\n  ^L. longicruris^ (\"long-stalked\"). Stem six to twelve feet long,\r\n  one to two inches thick, slender and solid at base, hollow and\r\n  inflated at the middle, contracted at the top; attached by a\r\n  strong, branching, root-like holdfast; color light brown. The\r\n  large, single, leaf-like lamina, usually shorter than the stem, is\r\n  five to twenty feet long, two to three feet broad, with much waved\r\n  and folded margin, outlined with two rows of depressed spots. The\r\n  spores form a band in the center of the blade. Found from Cape Cod\r\n  northward and on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\n  ^L. saccharina^, the sea-tangle. This species differs from /L.\r\n  longicruris/ in having a short, solid stem and narrow, ribbon-like\r\n  lamina. Stem three inches to four feet long; lamina three to\r\n  thirty feet long, six to eighteen inches wide, with central\r\n  band of depressed spots; margin much waved; color olive-green,\r\n  semi-transparent. It is named from the saccharine matter, called\r\n  /mannite/, which it contains. Found on northern shores of the\r\n  Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. (Plate XII.)\r\n\r\n  ^L. digitata^ (\"fingered\"). Stem one to five feet long, thick,\r\n  round, and solid; lamina oval at base, leathery, smooth, brown,\r\n  deeply cleft into segments of unequal breadth. It is named from the\r\n  hand-like form of the lamina. This species is found in Long Island\r\n  Sound, but is not common south of Cape Cod. The stem is used by\r\n  fishermen for knife-handles. Pieces of it, placed on the blades\r\n  while green, contract in drying and become solid.

Found\r\n  in tide-pools in Southern waters. (Plate XIII.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII. Laminaria digitata. Dictyota dichotoma.\r\nTaonia atomaria. Padina pavonia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV. Haliseris polypodioides. Cutleria\r\nmultifida. Fucus vesiculosus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Zonaria^\r\n\r\n  ^Z. lobata.^ Thallus flat, fan-shaped, but not so rounded as\r\n  in /Padina pavonia/, twelve or more inches in height, cleft\r\n  irregularly into many [pg071] narrow lobes, the clefts\r\n  extending nearly or quite to the base; olive-green, with concentric\r\n  zones of darker color; edges thin and bordered with a dark line.\r\n  Found in southern California and in tropical and subtropical seas.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Taonia^\r\n\r\n  ^T. atomaria.^ Spreading, fan-shaped frond; clefts irregular and\r\n  not extending to the basal stem; spores arranged in dark wavy\r\n  lines and spots on the frond, giving it a mottled appearance and\r\n  beautiful gradation of color. Found in tropical seas. (Plate XIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Padina^\r\n\r\n  ^P. pavonia^, the peacock's-tail. Frond broadly fan-shaped;\r\n  substance between membranaceous and leathery; powdery on the\r\n  outer surface; deeply and variously cleft or entire; several\r\n  laminæ emanating from a stalk-like base; each lamina fan-shaped;\r\n  concentric lines numerous; variegated in zones. This beautiful alga\r\n  is always regarded as a prize. It is found on stones at low-water\r\n  mark, and is not uncommon south of Charleston, South Carolina, but\r\n  is more luxuriant in tropical seas. (Plate XIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Haliseris^\r\n\r\nThe sea-endive.\r\n\r\n  ^H. polypodioides.^ Fronds flat, forked, notched on lower part;\r\n  divisions about one quarter of an inch wide; distinct midrib;\r\n  olive-green; grows in tufts. It is found in North and South\r\n  Carolina, and is abundant on the Florida Keys. (Plate XIV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =CUTLERIACEÆ=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cutleria^\r\n\r\n  ^C. multifida.^ Frond erect, flat; branches in a forking manner;\r\n  ultimate branches fine and short, and with branchlets on the tips.\r\n  This species resembles /Taonia/. It is found in Southern waters.\r\n  (Plate XIV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =FUCACEÆ=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Himanthalia^\r\n\r\n  ^H. lorea^, the sea-thong. A cup-shaped base, from the center of\r\n  which arises a flat, strap-like frond one fourth to one half of an\r\n  inch wide and two to twenty feet long, branching dichotomously (or\r\n  by forking), and dotted with pits, or conceptacles, in which the\r\n  spores are formed. Found in the extreme North. [pg072]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Fucus^\r\n\r\nThe rockweeds. The plants of this genus grow in thick bunches, and\r\nare found in great abundance between tide-marks. The plants are\r\nattached by sucker-like disks to the rocks, from which they hang like\r\nfringe when the tide recedes; when it rises they float and sway in\r\nthe water in beautiful bouquet-like forms. In color they are brown or\r\nolive-green, in texture thick and leathery, but they sometimes expand\r\ninto thin membranes. They are many times forked in the same plane,\r\nwhich produces a flat thallus. They often have a distinct midrib. The\r\nair-vessels, whose function it is to float the plant, are disposed\r\nalong the midrib, usually in pairs.\r\n\r\nThe species are named according to the divisions of the frond,\r\nand the disposition, or presence, of the air-bladders and the\r\n/conceptacles/, or spore-chambers.\r\n\r\nThe conceptacles congregate in particular portions of the frond and\r\ngive its surface a roughness which is very perceptible; such portions\r\nare then known as the /receptacles/. In /Fucus/ this usually occurs\r\non the bulbous extremities of the branches. Under the microscope a\r\nsection of one of these little pointed spots shows a spherical cavity\r\nfilled with a beautiful arrangement of /paraphyses/, or threads,\r\nsome of which hold spores, while others protrude through a small\r\nopening in the outer membrane. Conceptacles are peculiar to the\r\norder =Fucaceæ=. In them spore-production is carried on in a manner\r\nas complicated as is the formation of seeds in flowering plants.\r\nAlthough rockweeds are such a conspicuous feature of sea-shore\r\nvegetation, two species only, /Fucus vesiculosus/ and /Ascophyllum\r\nnodosum/ (formerly called /Fucus nodosus/), are common on the\r\nAtlantic coast, and these do not occur south of New York, owing to\r\nthe fact that a long stretch of sand-beach extends beyond that point.\r\n\r\n  ^F. vesiculosus.^ Midrib distinct through all the forked branches;\r\n  margin entire, often wavy; air-vessels spherical or oblong, usually\r\n  in pairs along the midrib; receptacles on terminal branches, which\r\n  are swollen and filled with gelatinous matter, heart-shaped or\r\n  forked, in oblong or pointed divisions; frond tough and leathery,\r\n  often two feet long. (Plate XIV.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV. Fucus serratus. Fucus ceranoides.\r\nAscophyllum nodosum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI. Phyllospora Menziesii. Halidrys osmunda.\r\nSargassum vulgare.]\r\n\r\n  ^F. serratus.^ Frond distinctly toothed or serrated along the\r\n  margin; midrib conspicuous through the main axis and forked\r\n  branchings; no air-vessels. This species is rare on the Atlantic\r\n  coast. (Plate XV.)\r\n\r\n  ^F. furcatus.^ Frond narrow, tough, without air-vessels; regular\r\n  forked branching; midrib distinct below, inconspicuous above;\r\n  receptacles long, narrow, not inflated. Found from Boston northward.\r\n\r\n  ^F. ceranoides.^ Frond flat, rather membranaceous, or less leathery\r\n  than in the preceding species; repeatedly forked; midrib not\r\n  running through every division; no air-vessels. (Plate XV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ascophyllum^\r\n\r\n  ^A. nodosum.^ This species, formerly called /Fucus nodosus/, is\r\n  next to /Fucus vesiculosus/ the most common rockweed. Frond one to\r\n  five feet long, dark brown, strap-like, leathery; width of main\r\n  stems one fourth of an inch or more, and uniform throughout; large,\r\n  single, oblong air-vessels distend the frond at intervals. Branches\r\n  of various length emerge from the sides of the main stem. Ovoid or\r\n  ellipsoidal branchlets or receptacles, single or in groups, occur\r\n  at intervals along the sides of both stem and branches. These fall\r\n  off after a time and are found in quantities in tide-pools. (Plate\r\n  XV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Phyllospora^\r\n\r\n  ^P. Menziesii.^ Branching holdfast; short stem which immediately\r\n  divides into strap-like branches; branches edged with leaves\r\n  varying in length, rounded at top, narrow, stalked at base; leaves\r\n  placed at intervals, or crowded together, and interspersed with\r\n  air-vessels which are often tipped with leaflets; stems expand at\r\n  summit into leaf-like laminæ and are edged with leaflets at the\r\n  base; plant often one hundred and twenty feet or more in length;\r\n  tough and leathery in substance. Very common on the California\r\n  coast. (Plate XVI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cystoseira^\r\n\r\n  ^C. expansa.^ Frond long, slender, repeatedly branched; air-vessels\r\n  ellipsoidal and \"chained\" together in the lower half of the\r\n  branches. The plant grows in deep water, ad shows iridescent colors\r\n  when seen through the water. It is found on the California coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Halidrys^\r\n\r\n  ^H. osmunda^, the sea-oak. Frond flat, alternately toothed\r\n  or indented below; branched apex, bearing air-vessels like\r\n  long-stalked pods; substance leathery. Found on the coast of\r\n  southern California. (Plate XVI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Sargassum^\r\n\r\n^Sargassum^ is distinguished by its differentiation into stem and\r\nleaf, resembling in outward appearance the higher plants. It [pg074]\r\nis a tropical and subtropical genus, and has one hundred and fifty\r\nspecies. Two of these, /S. vulgare/ and /S. Montagnei/, are found as\r\nfar north as Cape Cod. See Introduction, page 34.\r\n\r\n  ^S. vulgare.^ Stems cylindrical; branches alternate; leaves long,\r\n  narrow, toothed, with short stalk and midrib; minute dark spots\r\n  on its surface; air-vessels small balls resembling berries set on\r\n  stalks and usually tipped with a long point; receptacles small,\r\n  twig-like forms in the axils of the leaves; color olive-brown;\r\n  plant one foot to three or more feet long. Common in Long Island\r\n  Sound. (Plate XVI.)\r\n\r\n  ^S. Montagnei.^ This species resembles /S. vulgare/, but is more\r\n  slender in all its parts, and the receptacles are more elongated.\r\n  From south of Cape Cod.\r\n\r\n  ^S. bacciferum.^ Particular interest attaches to this species from\r\n  the fact that it is the one which forms the floating vegetation\r\n  of the Sargasso Sea. It grows attached on the Florida Keys and in\r\n  the West Indies. Specimens are sometimes carried by the currents\r\n  northward, and are found washed ashore. It differs from /S.\r\n  vulgare/ in the leaves, which are thicker, more attenuated, and\r\n  sharply toothed, and in having a greater number of air-vessels.\r\n  A branch of this species brought from the Sargasso Sea had\r\n  air-vessels so numerous and closely set that it resembled a bunch\r\n  of small grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nRED SEAWEEDS\r\n\r\n(RHODOPHYCEÆ OR FLORIDEÆ)\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE RED SEAWEEDS DESCRIBED IN\r\nTHIS CHAPTER\r\n\r\n    Class =ALGÆ=\r\n\r\n      Subclass =Rhodophyceæ or Florideæ= (/Red Seaweeds/)\r\n\r\n   Order =NEMALIONACEÆ=\r\n\r\n      Suborders              Genera              Species\r\n\r\n      ~HELMINTHOCLADIEÆ~     ^Nemalion^          ^N. multifidum^\r\n                             ^Liagora^\r\n\r\n      ~CHÆTANGIEÆ~           ^Scinaia^           ^S. furcellata^\r\n\r\n      ~GELIDIEÆ~             ^Gelidium^          ^G. corneum^\r\n\r\n   Order =GIGARTINACEÆ=\r\n\r\n                             ^Chondrus^          ^C. crispus^\r\n                             ^Gigartina^         ^G. mamillosa^\r\n                                                 ^G. radula^\r\n                                                 ^G. spinosa^\r\n                                                 ^G. microphylla^\r\n                             ^Phyllophora^       ^P. membranifolia^\r\n                                                 ^P.

This is marked by the mode\r\nof reproduction, which, more nearly than in the other subclasses,\r\nresembles that of flowering plants. The fronds, however, are not as\r\nlarge and do not as closely resemble stem and leaf as do some species\r\nof the brown algæ.\r\n\r\nThe species of this subclass are very numerous, and the variety in\r\ntheir fronds, their delicate texture, and their colors, which vary\r\nfrom pink to purple, make them the most attractive of the seaweeds.\r\nThey grow mostly in deep water, but are often found washed ashore,\r\nand many grow just below low-water mark and on the shady side of\r\ntide-pools.\r\n\r\nIn the simplest species the frond consists of branched cell-rows.\r\nIn some of these the filaments are so fine that a pocket-lens is\r\nrequired to determine the differences in branching and fully to\r\nappreciate the beauty of the plant (/Callithamnion/). Some have a\r\ncell-surface. In /Delesseria/ the membrane assumes the outline of a\r\nfoliage-leaf. /Dasya/, which is an abundant variety, is especially\r\nbeautiful in its feather-like appearance. The corallines are singular\r\nin that they are incrusted with lime and resemble corals.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =NEMALIONACEÆ=\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ~HELMINTHOCLADIEÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Nemalion^\r\n\r\nThe threadweeds.\r\n\r\n  ^N. multifidum.^ Frond six to twelve inches long, cylindrical,\r\n  solid, cord-like, elastic, tough, shiny, very gelatinous; branches\r\n  repeatedly in [pg080] a wide-forking manner; sometimes a branch\r\n  will divide into several parts at the same point; color dark brown\r\n  or purple.

In shallow tide-pools\r\n  it is pale and [pg081] stunted; but under the shelter of\r\n  rocks, in deep water, it grows in dense masses and is a dark\r\n  purplish-red or reddish-green. Often it appears iridescent when\r\n  seen through the water, with the sun shining on it. It is firm and\r\n  leathery in substance.

It is by the number of these\r\nparts, called siphons, which vary in number from four to twenty, that\r\nthe species is determined. In some plants the siphons are surrounded\r\nby a layer of cells, called corticating or bark cells, which give\r\nthe filaments a solid, uniform appearance. In others the siphons are\r\nnaked, and the filaments then seem striped or banded with color. It\r\nis difficult, without a microscope, to be sure of the classification.\r\nThere are, however, other characteristics which separate many of the\r\nspecies, and some of these are described below. Two hundred species\r\nof /Polysiphonia/ have been named by algologists. The plants are\r\nplentiful on all shores, especially in warm, shallow waters. Some\r\nspecies are perennial, but most of them are annuals and disappear in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n  ^P. fastigiata.^ This species grows on /Ascophyllum nodosum/ in\r\n  a globular tuft, and appears like a dark-brown ball, one inch\r\n  to three inches in diameter. The frond is a dense mass of rigid\r\n  filaments branching many times in a forking manner and at broad\r\n  angles. The ends are of nearly equal length, giving the plant\r\n  a spherical shape. It is common from New York northward at all\r\n  seasons, and is easily recognized by its general form and place of\r\n  growth. Egg-shaped cystocarps, or spore-cases, occur in the ends of\r\n  the terminal filaments. (Plate XXV.)\r\n\r\n  ^P. nigrescens.^ Frond three to twelve inches long, rigid below,\r\n  soft above; main stem thick as a bristle, but not always easy to\r\n  distinguish; branches alternate and densely branched at the ends;\r\n  siphons twelve to sixteen in number; filaments banded; color black\r\n  or very dark brown.

Common on the\r\n  California coast.\r\n\r\n  ^P. Harveyi.^ Frond two to six inches high; grows in globose tufts,\r\n  and has a bushy aspect; branches stiff and wide-spreading; stems\r\n  and branches beset with simple or branched spine-like branchlets;\r\n  color dark brown, or black when dry; does not collapse when taken\r\n  from the water; cystocarps on short stalks; siphons four in number.\r\n  It grows on eel-grass and algæ, and is common in Long Island Sound\r\n  and northward. Called locally /niggerhair/. (Plate XXVI.)\r\n\r\n  ^P. Olneyi^ (dough-balls).

It grows\r\n  on wharves and on algæ below low-water mark, and is a common and\r\n  beautiful species. It is found (but only in the spring) from New\r\n  York northward, and is abundant in Long Island Sound. (Plates XXX,\r\n  XXXI.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. Pylais[oe]i.^ Fronds three to six inches long, more robust\r\n  and darker in color than in /C. Americanum/; main and secondary\r\n  branches alternate, decompound, all bearing at short intervals\r\n  short opposite branchlets, which in turn are covered with ramuli.\r\n  It is found in spring on wharves and on algæ from Boston northward.\r\n  (Plate XXX.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. Baileyi.^ Fronds one inch to three inches long, with main\r\n  stem as thick as a bristle, and running to the top of the frond;\r\n  branches around the main stem longer at the base than at the\r\n  apex, giving the plant a pyramidal outline; branches also have a\r\n  main stem and short branches beset with branchlets; shrub-like in\r\n  aspect; color purplish-red. Common in summer from New York to Cape\r\n  Cod.\r\n\r\n  ^C. seirospermum.^ Frond two to five inches high, pyramidal in\r\n  outline; has main stem and alternate lateral branches; branches\r\n  have secondary branches beset with delicate, erect branchlets;\r\n  hair-like in fineness.

These are\r\ncalled /Protozoa/, and comprise the /Infusoria/ and other microscopic\r\norganisms. The animals next higher in the scale are /Metazoa/, or\r\nmulticellular animals, and the first group of this subdivision is\r\n=Porifera=, the sponges, the lowest of the many-celled animals.\r\n\r\nFor a long time sponges occupied a disputed ground between the animal\r\nand vegetable kingdoms. Aristotle was the first to point out that a\r\nsponge is not a plant. The assertion was doubted and combated, but at\r\nlast the animal nature of the sponge was established. Sponges were\r\nthen believed to be colonies of one-celled animals, but finally it\r\nwas decided that they were individuals with cells of different kinds\r\nthat performed functions analogous to those of higher organisms.\r\n\r\nThe sponge, as commonly seen, is only the skeleton or framework, so\r\nto speak, of the living animal. In its natural state it is a very\r\ndifferent-looking object. Its entire surface is covered with a thin\r\nslimy skin, usually of a dark color, which is perforated with holes\r\ncorresponding to the apertures of the canals. The organic portion\r\nof the sponge is a soft, jelly-like substance composed of three\r\nlayers--the external (/ectoderm/), the internal (/endoderm/), and\r\nthe middle (/mesoderm/). The external layer is composed of flat\r\ncells. The endoderm has cylindrical cells, each one of which has a\r\nflagellate hair. The main mass of the body, the mesoderm or middle\r\nlayer, is made up of cells having various functions, some being\r\nconcerned in the formation of framework, some in digestion, and some\r\nin reproduction.\r\n\r\nThe framework is secreted in the mesoderm, and in different\r\n[pg102] genera consists respectively of a horny or silicious or\r\ncalcareous substance, or of the first two of these substances\r\ncombined. The sponge of commerce has the first kind and is composed\r\nentirely of exceedingly fine flexible fibers of a horny substance\r\ncalled /spongin/. In other species the spongin is intermixed with\r\nspicules of silica, or of carbonate of lime, in various shapes.\r\nIn the sponges, so much valued as curiosities, called \"Venus's\r\nflower-basket\" and \"glass-rope sponge,\" the framework is composed of\r\nsilicious spicules alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Various forms of sponge-spicules.]\r\n\r\nThe spicules have a great variety of shapes, being rod-like, knobbed,\r\nthree-pointed, six-pointed, anchor-like, etc., and are a feature in\r\nthe classification of sponges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: To illustrate choanocytes (/Ch/): section of a\r\ncalcareous sponge. /Ect/, ectoderm; /Mes/, mesoderm; /N/, calcareous\r\nspicule; /Eiz/, ovum.]\r\n\r\nThe sponge is traversed throughout by a canal system, consisting of a\r\nseries of tubes through which water circulates, carrying air and food\r\nto the animal. The exterior of the sponge has numerous small pores\r\nand a comparatively few large openings. The fine pores are inhalent,\r\ntaking in and straining the water of its coarser floating material,\r\nand then passing it through perforations in their sides into sacs\r\nlined with peculiar cylindrical cells having flagellate hairs, each\r\nhair having a collar at its base. These cells, called /choanocytes/,\r\nresemble independent animals of the /Protozoa/, known as /flagellate\r\nInfusoria/ or /Choanoflagellata/. [pg103] They take in and digest\r\nfood and eject excrement from the area inclosed by the collar. The\r\ncilia (hairs) by their constant movement create currents which keep\r\nthe water in motion. Water, then, is taken through the pores into\r\nthe first or incurrent canals; thence it is passed into the ciliated\r\nchambers, and thence into the excurrent canals, and out through large\r\npassages terminating in large openings called /oscula/, or craters.\r\nThe canal systems vary. In some species they become quite complex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Canal system of /Sycon gelatinosum/. Transverse\r\nsection through the wall of a cylinder (parallel with the course of\r\nthe canals), showing one incurrent canal (/IC/) and one radial (/R/)\r\nthroughout their length; /sp/, triradiate spicules; /sp´/, oxeate\r\nspicules of dermal cortex (/dc/); /sp´´/, tetraradiate spicules\r\nof gastral cortex (/gc/); /ec/, ectoderm; /en/, endoderm; /pm/,\r\npore-membrane; /pp/, prosopyle; /ap/, apopyle; /di/, diaphragm;\r\n/exc/, excurrent passage; /PG/, paragastric cavity; /em/, early\r\nembryo; /em´/, late embryo. (The arrows indicate the course of the\r\nwater through the sponge.)]\r\n\r\nSponges vary greatly in shape, size, color, surface, rigidity,\r\ncanal systems, and skeleton. They are cake-shaped, tubular,\r\ndigitate, palmate, cup-shaped, vase-shaped, cone-shaped, spherical,\r\nhemispherical, pedunculate, etc., their shapes depending upon whether\r\ntheir growth is uniform or is excessive in a horizontal or in a\r\nvertical direction. When they grow evenly in both directions massive\r\nuniform shapes arise. If lateral growth predominates, broad, low,\r\nand incrusting shapes result. When there is an excess of vertical\r\ngrowth the forms are digitate; [pg104] but if vertical growth is not\r\ngreatly in excess and is restricted to the marginal part, cup-shaped\r\nforms result, and tubular forms when lateral growth is particularly\r\nrestricted. In some varieties tubular masses coalesce; sometimes flat\r\nforms unite in intricate compressed folds. Differences in rapidity of\r\nvertical growth make undulations more or less marked, producing lobes\r\nand protuberances. Sometimes narrow vertical growth is retarded and\r\nhorizontal growth predominates, forming various shapes on apparent\r\nstems.\r\n\r\nMany of the horny sponges are colored, in shades of yellow, brown,\r\nred, and violet; some are black.\r\n\r\nSponges are divided into two classes, the =Calcarea= and\r\n=Non-Calcarea=. The former have calcareous skeletons, which make them\r\nhard and rigid; the latter have skeletons of spongin-fiber or of\r\nsilicious spicules, or of the two combined.\r\n\r\nAll sponges, with the exception of one family (the /Spongillidæ/,\r\nwhich live in fresh water), are inhabitants of the sea, and live at\r\nvarious depths. The sponges of commerce belong to the /Non-Calcarea/\r\nand are all confined to the genus /Spongia/. In this genus the\r\nskeleton is more or less flexible, being composed of spongin. They\r\nare shallow-water species, are confined to seas where the waters are\r\nof comparatively uniform high temperature, and flourish best when\r\nprotected by reefs and islands.\r\n\r\nThere are fisheries for sponges in the waters of the West Indies, the\r\nBahamas, on the southern and western coasts of Florida, and in the\r\nMediterranean and Red seas. Those of the Mediterranean surpass in\r\nquality the sponges of our coasts.\r\n\r\nFive species of commercial sponges are taken from Florida waters.\r\nThey are graded by the trade in the order of their importance, as the\r\n\"sheepswool,\" \"yellow,\" \"grass,\" \"velvet,\" and \"glove.\" The fishing\r\nfor sponges is done from small boats, two persons manning each boat.\r\nOne man sculls, while the other, using a water-glass, scans the\r\nbottom. The water-glass is a box with a pane of glass on the bottom.\r\nIf the glass is held below the surface and the face is placed in\r\nthe box, the observer is enabled to see with some distinctness the\r\nbottom at a considerable depth [pg105] in these clear waters. The\r\nsponges are dragged up by hooks--a primitive method which restricts\r\nthe fishing to shallow water, the fishing here being in water not\r\ndeeper than thirty feet, but usually three to twenty feet. The\r\nsponges are \"killed\" by being exposed on the beach for several days;\r\nthey are then placed in \"crawls,\" or pens, where they are washed by\r\nthe action of the waves for about a week; then, if clean, they are\r\ndried, assorted, strung on cords, pressed and baled for shipment. The\r\nsponge-fisheries are of considerable value, and much attention is\r\nbeing given to the subject of artificial propagation. It is thought\r\nthat such beds could be subjected to the regulations which govern\r\noyster-beds. Already the planting of sponges has been shown to be\r\npracticable. The living sponge is cut to pieces, and the cuttings\r\nare placed in favorable localities. Pieces planted in Florida waters\r\nattain a marketable size in one year.\r\n\r\nSponges reproduce by eggs formed in the mesoderm. The eggs escape as\r\nciliated spheres and swim about until they find a place on which to\r\nattach themselves. As soon as they become fixed they grow with much\r\nrapidity into mature individuals.\r\n\r\nSome species seem to prefer association with other animals and live\r\nas commensals with crabs. The crab /Dromia/ is always concealed under\r\na sponge, which grows upon its back. Spider-crabs are often overgrown\r\nwith sponges as well as seaweeds. In this case, however, the crab\r\nfinds and plants the sponge himself. /Aplysella violacea/ overgrows\r\nworm-tubes. Many sponges afford shelter to numerous small animals\r\nwhich bore into their bodies for protection, no animal seeming to\r\nfeed upon the sponge.\r\n\r\nSponges may be found in tide-pools, on the under side of stones,\r\non seaweeds, and so on. A small bright-red incrusting sponge with\r\nirregular lobe-like branches is common on the New England coast; a\r\nthin yellow incrusting sponge also is found on the under side of\r\nstones. /Grantia ciliata/, a small urn-shaped species, having a large\r\naperture at the summit, is found in tide-pools.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most singular in habit of any sponge is /Cliona\r\nsulphurea/, the boring-sponge, a common species found from Cape\r\nCod to South Carolina and abundant in Long Island Sound. It\r\n[pg106] is bright sulphur-yellow in color, grows in irregular\r\nmasses of considerable size and fine texture, and has low wart-like\r\nprominences. It lives on shells spreading over both surfaces, at\r\nfirst forming little burrows, but eventually penetrating the shell in\r\nevery direction, honeycombing and at last completely destroying it\r\nby absorption. Sometimes it settles upon living shells and greatly\r\nirritates the animal, which constantly secretes new lime to cover the\r\nperforations in its shell.\r\n\r\nThese sponges are an important factor in the economy of the sea, as\r\nthey disintegrate dead shells, which would otherwise accumulate in\r\nvast quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCLASS =CALCAREA=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Grantia^\r\n\r\n  ^G. ciliata.^ Small, urn-shaped or oval, with large aperture at the\r\n  summit, surrounded by a circle of projecting spicules.

It is found in shallow\r\n  water from Cape Cod to North Carolina, and is abundant in Long\r\n  Island Sound. (Plate XXXIX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Euspongia^\r\n\r\n  ^E. officinalis.^ This is one of the commercial sponges and is\r\n  known as the \"glove-sponge.\" It is the one of least marketable\r\n  value, having inferior elasticity and becoming brittle with\r\n  age; yet a Mediterranean sponge of the same species, variety\r\n  /adriatica/, is of the finest quality and greatest value. This\r\n  singular fact demonstrates that the quality of sponges depends\r\n  largely upon physical conditions. /E. officinalis/ has an average\r\n  height of five to six inches. It grows on rocky bottoms in shallow\r\n  water on the east coast of Florida. This species has a number of\r\n  varieties of various forms; some are dome-shaped, others tubular,\r\n  rotund, flabellate, etc. The surface is covered with fine tufts\r\n  and is generally free from ridges. On the sides are numerous small\r\n  apertures, [pg108] and one or more large oscula occur on top. The\r\n  color of the living sponge is black. (Plates XXXIX, XL.)\r\n\r\n  ^E. officinalis^, variety ^adriatica^. More or less globose;\r\n  sometimes attached by a broad base, sometimes by a short stem;\r\n  latter form more or less club-shaped; oscula scattered over upper\r\n  surface. Found in the West Indies and the Mediterranean. (Plate XL.)\r\n\r\n  ^E. officinalis^, variety ^mollissima^, the Levant toilet-sponge.\r\n  Generally cup-shaped; oscula on inner side of cup or on upper flat\r\n  surface; very soft and elastic.\r\n\r\n  ^E. officinalis^, variety ^rotunda^. Usually massive; attached by a\r\n  broad base; sides vertical; oscula large and conspicuous on top, or\r\n  small in longitudinal rows on the sides. In the young this variety\r\n  may have a conical form with only one orifice, but later it has\r\n  several oscula. Its rotundity of form increases with the number of\r\n  large orifices, but in the adult stages the form varies, some being\r\n  conical, while others have the top divided into radiating ridges.\r\n\r\n  ^E. officinalis^, variety ^dura^. Irregular, massive, horizontally\r\n  expanded, with conical process on upper surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Hippospongia^\r\n\r\n  ^H. equina.^ Some of the sponges of this species are massive,\r\n  spherical, and attached by a small base; others are horizontally\r\n  expanded or cake-shaped; some have a depression in the upper\r\n  surface and become cup-shaped.\r\n\r\n  ^H. equina^, variety ^cerebriformis^. Massive, circular,\r\n  cake-shaped, often depressed in the center, producing a cup-shape,\r\n  attached by broad base; surface broken up by parallel longitudinal\r\n  ridges having many tufts. Cup-shaped forms predominate, and have\r\n  a more or less rough surface. This is one of the species known as\r\n  grass-sponges.\r\n\r\n  ^H. equina^, variety ^meandriformis^, the velvet sponge. The\r\n  surface of this variety has a protruding flattened cushion of fiber\r\n  which slightly resembles the convolutions of the brain-coral.\r\n  Sometimes these cushions are extended into long pencils. The oscula\r\n  are large and ragged on the edges; the shape is irregular. The\r\n  average size is seven to eight inches in diameter. (Plate XL.)\r\n\r\n  ^H. equina^, variety ^elastica^ (variety ^agaricina^, Hyatt), the\r\n  yellow sponge. This is the second grade of commercial sponge,\r\n  corresponding to the Zimocca sponge of the Mediterranean. It is\r\n  found growing with the \"sheepswool\" in a depth of two to twenty\r\n  feet, and is abundant. It is massive and cake-shaped. The whole\r\n  surface is a network covered with numerous small, fine cones.\r\n  (Plate XL.)\r\n\r\n  The variety ^dura^ is classed with this species, which it resembles\r\n  in appearance, though it is harder in texture.\r\n\r\n  ^H. canaliculata.^ Massive, frondose; more or less horizontally\r\n  expanded; bears finger-like processes of varying development on the\r\n  upper surface.\r\n\r\n  ^H. canaliculata^, variety ^gossypina^, the sheepswool sponge. This\r\n  is the highest grade of the commercial bath-sponge. It is called\r\n  \"sheepswool\" because, perhaps, of its irregular shaggy surface. It\r\n  is covered with tufts, the larger oscula occupying the intervening\r\n  depressions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XL. Euspongia officinalis, var. adriatica.\r\nHippospongia equina, var. meandriformis. Hippospongia canaliculata,\r\nvar. gossypina. Hippospongia equina, var. elastica. Euspongia\r\nofficinalis.]\r\n\r\n  Sometimes these are very numerous, the whole interior being\r\n  cavernous; again, the structure is more dense, with fewer large\r\n  openings and more of the small ones between the tufts; again, the\r\n  depressions are filled up so that the surface has fewer tufts.\r\n  When living, the color is shining black. This is the best sponge\r\n  found on the American coast, and although of coarser texture than\r\n  the best Mediterranean sponges, it is more durable and quite as\r\n  elastic. (Plate XL.)\r\n\r\n  ^H. canaliculata^, variety ^flabellum^ (^Spongia graminea^, Hyatt).\r\n  This is one of the species of sponges of the third commercial\r\n  grade, which bear the trade-name of \"grass-sponge.\" The shape is\r\n  cone-like, with either a flat or a funnel-shaped top. The oscula\r\n  are on the upper surface. The sides are fluted with deep furrows\r\n  which contain the small incurrent apertures.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Hircinia^\r\n\r\n  ^H. campana.^ The normal variety is vase-shaped, but the species\r\n  varies greatly in form. Some varieties have branches. When living,\r\n  its color is black. It is found at Key West in four to forty feet\r\n  depth. (Plate XXXVIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n  C[OE]LENTERATA\r\n  (POLYPS)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhylum\r\n\r\n=C[OE]LENTERATA=\r\n\r\nClasses\r\n\r\n=HYDROZOA=\r\n\r\n(/Zoöphytes, small Jellyfishes, and a few Corals/)\r\n\r\n=SCYPHOZOA=\r\n\r\n(/Large Jellyfishes/)\r\n\r\n=ACTINOZOA=\r\n\r\n(/Sea-anemones and most of the Stony Corals/)\r\n\r\n=CTENOPHORA=\r\n\r\n(/Comb-jellies/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC[OE]LENTERATA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe animals included in the phylum =C[oe]lenterata= were once all\r\ncalled /zoöphytes/, or animal plants, because of their resemblance\r\nto vegetable forms. The name /C[oe]lenterata/ is derived from two\r\nGreek words meaning \"hollow\" and \"intestine,\" and it describes the\r\nanatomical structure of each member of the group. They are commonly\r\nknown as polyps. In the simplest forms the parts which perform the\r\ndifferent functions cannot be distinguished one from the other, and\r\neven in higher forms there is but little differentiation. Shakspere's\r\ndescription of old age applies to them: \"Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans\r\ntaste, sans everything.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this very low order of animals has, like the\r\nhigher orders, such a diversity of form and habit as to require\r\nclassification. Some of them are stationary, and of these some branch\r\nlike plants; some move about by the aid of tentacles, some move by\r\nmeans of vibrating cilia, and others move by the contraction and\r\nexpansion of the soft body.\r\n\r\nCuvier included them in his /Radiata/, a class comprising all the\r\nanimals whose parts diverge or radiate from a central axis. Recent\r\nclassification has divided the radiate animals into several classes.\r\nThis arrangement of parts is obviously quite different from that\r\nof bilateral symmetry, or the disposal of parts on each side of a\r\nlongitudinal axis. The type of radiate structure is shown in polyps.\r\nThe body is a sac, in the center of which is another sac or axis.\r\nThis is the digestive cavity. Vertical partitions extend from the\r\ncentral to the outer sac, forming distinct [pg114] divisions or\r\nchambers. The number of divisions varies with the different species\r\nand also with the age of the animal. Other partitions start from the\r\nouter sac, and extend toward the central axis, but do not unite with\r\nit. These partitions, called /mesenteries/, are always in definite\r\nmultiples, varying in different species, new divisions growing\r\nbetween the first partitions in regular order. On the inner edge\r\nof these partitions the eggs of the animal are formed, which, when\r\nmature, drop into the chambers and pass through openings into the\r\ninner sac, or digestive cavity, and out of the mouth into the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of radiate structure.]\r\n\r\nThe animals are classed according as the eggs are formed on all\r\nor on special partitions, those being of the highest order where\r\na limitation and constancy of function is maintained. The upper\r\nsurface of the body has hollow tentacles, each one of which opens\r\ninto one of the chambers and extends outward. All parts of the animal\r\ncommunicate, and whatever enters the mouth circulates through the\r\nwhole structure; and when assimilation is completed the residue\r\nreturns by the same road and is expelled through the mouth. This\r\nstructure is common to all polyps; but there are great differences\r\nin their texture, some being soft and some horny, while others\r\ndeposit a calcareous skeleton (corals). Some grow in colonies, like\r\nthe hydroids and corals, and are stationary, others are free and\r\nindependent; some have but few, others have many tentacles; and they\r\ndiffer widely in size, form, and color.\r\n\r\nHydroids, sea-anemones, corals, sea-fans, starfishes, and sea-urchins\r\nare different examples of the radiate structure. They are not,\r\nhowever, all of them polyps.\r\n\r\nThe /C[oe]lenterata/ are divided into four classes: =Hydrozoa=, which\r\ninclude the colonies of zoöphytes which resemble seaweeds, the small\r\njellyfishes which are born of these colonies, and the /millepores/,\r\nwhich are colonies of zoöphytes which secrete a stony instead of a\r\nhorny skeleton, yet differ in some respects from other [pg115] stony\r\ncorals; =Scyphozoa=, large jellyfishes, many of which do not have the\r\ndouble form of development; =Actinozoa=, the sea-anemones and the\r\ndifferent forms of stony corals, including sea-fans, sea-pens, etc.;\r\n=Ctenophora=, the jellyfishes commonly known as comb-jellies.

From casual\r\nobservation these two forms would not be associated together, for the\r\nshrub-like organisms, which so much resemble plants that they are\r\noften collected and preserved as seaweeds, suggest only vegetable\r\nlife. Examined with a glass, however, they disclose their animal\r\nnature. Along the stems, arranged in various ways, are small cups,\r\nfrom which protrude the numerous moving tentacles of the little\r\npolyps living within them.\r\n\r\n/Hydroids are colonies of associated animals living a communal life./\r\nThe multitude of individuals composing the colony are invested with\r\na horny covering, the /perisarc/, which in some genera assumes a\r\ntree-like form. Through these stems and branches runs a fleshy tube,\r\na thread of animal substance, which connects in one living whole\r\nthe zoöids, or individuals of the community. There is division of\r\nlabor, as in other communities: some of the zoöids obtain the food\r\nfor the colony, and have tentacles around their open mouths; others\r\nhave no mouths, but reproduce the species, and at certain stages of\r\ndevelopment liberate swimming-bells, or small jellyfishes (medusæ).\r\n\r\nThe typical hydroid colony is attached by a kind of creeping stem\r\nfrom which arises a vertical axis, which gives off short lateral,\r\nalternate branches bearing zoöids at their ends. There is often more\r\ncomplex branching. The zoöids in certain genera (tubularians) are\r\nuncovered; in others (sertularians) they are incased in a glassy,\r\ncup-like, horny sheath.\r\n\r\nThree kinds of zoöids, polyps, or hydranths--as they are\r\nindiscriminately called--are attached to the stem. Those having\r\nan [pg120] open end and a crown of tentacles are the nutritive\r\nindividuals. Small, club-like dilations are immature zoöids. The\r\n/blastostyles/, or reproductive zoöids, are long, cylindrical,\r\nmouthless, and covered. At maturity the cover is ruptured, and the\r\nmedusæ have the appearance of a pile of thin saucers attached by the\r\nmiddle of the convex side. When at length these saucers are set free\r\nas little medusæ, or jellyfishes, the convex side of each saucer,\r\nor swimming-bell, is called the /ex-umbrella/; the concave, under\r\nside, the /subumbrella/. From the center of the subumbrella projects\r\nthe /manubrium/, or stomach of the animal. At the free end of the\r\nmanubrium is a four-cornered mouth. From the attached end of the\r\n/manubrium/ four tubes or canals diverge, and, extending through the\r\nanimal, open into a circular canal which runs around the margin of\r\nthe umbrella. When the medusa is as above described, it has reached\r\nthe highest point in its development.\r\n\r\nWhen the medusa has matured, it lays eggs, known as /planulæ/. These\r\nare spherical bodies covered with cilia (hairs), by means of which\r\nthey swim about for a time; but they finally attach themselves\r\nto some object, there to grow and develop into hydroid colonies.\r\nThe cycle of life is thus completed. This process is known as\r\n/alternation of generation/, or /metagenesis/, one life-history\r\ncontaining two quite different forms of being. The term of life of an\r\nindividual is one year, the zoöphyte stage beginning in the autumn\r\nand the medusa stage in the spring.\r\n\r\nSome medusæ, besides reproducing by means of eggs, multiply by\r\nbudding, small medusæ growing on the manubrium or on the margin of\r\nthe umbrella. /Sarsia/ and /Lizzia/ sometimes increase by budding.\r\n\r\nThe /Hydrozoa/ are not all of the above type. In the sertularians the\r\nzoöids perish on the stem and have no medusa life, their reproductive\r\nelement giving rise to the hydroid form without metamorphosis. The\r\n/Trachylinæ/ have no hydroid life, being always free-swimming medusæ;\r\nothers, the /Siphonophora/, live a hydroid life which is unattached,\r\nthe colony floating on the ocean; the millepores secrete calcareous\r\nskeletons and always remain fixed, reproducing by budding. [pg121]\r\n\r\nHydroids are very abundant, but are comprised in the few groups\r\nmentioned: namely, those which live only in the fixed colonial state;\r\nthose which have alternation of generation, being first hydroids\r\nand then swimming-bells, or medusæ; those which live always in the\r\nmedusa state, the eggs of the jellyfish developing at once into\r\nother medusæ; and the /Siphonophora/, or those which have a floating\r\ncolonial state, the hydroid never being attached, but floating at\r\nlarge and capable of locomotion, some of the colony having the\r\nfunction of propulsion.\r\n\r\nHydroids are particularly interesting as exemplifying the close\r\nresemblance that may exist in outward appearance between animal and\r\nvegetable life and as illustrations of communal life and of the\r\nalternation of generation. A few examples of different types are\r\ngiven below.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =LEPTOLINIÆ=\r\n\r\nThe members of this order agree in all essential particulars being\r\nbranched colonies having two principal forms of zoöids, the nutritive\r\nand the reproductive. Some genera attain the length of several\r\ninches, or even feet; others are very small tufts growing on shells\r\nand seaweeds. The cup may completely inclose the zoöid and be close\r\nto the stem (sessile), as in sertularians; it may be on the end of\r\na short stalk, as in campanularians; or it may not reach above the\r\nbase of the zoöid, as in tubularians. The genera are based upon these\r\ndifferences in the perisarc.\r\n\r\nThe hydroids, like all other classes, exist in such great variety\r\nthat it would be impracticable to describe here the many named\r\nspecies; but to recognize the genera is simple. A long tubular\r\npedicel without a cup is characteristic of the tubularians; the\r\ncampanularians have an arborescent form and bell-shaped cups on\r\nstalks; the sertularians have sessile cups; and the plumularians have\r\na feather-like form, with zoöid-cups on one side only of the branches.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful and varied structure of these \"animal plants\" is most\r\ninteresting, and to be fully appreciated they should be seen [pg122]\r\nin life and examined with a glass. Some species are confined to deep\r\nwater, but many are littoral and to be found in tide-pools, in the\r\nchinks and crannies of rocks, under stones, and under the hanging\r\n/Fucus/. The horny skeletons of large varieties are frequently washed\r\nashore, and in their tangled masses smaller living species often may\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TUBULARIANS\r\n\r\nThis division is characterized by zoöids borne on long, slender stems\r\nwhich are sometimes simple and small, sometimes branching and eight\r\nto ten inches long. The zoöid has two rows of tentacles, the central\r\none being sometimes on a kind of proboscis. The reproductive zoöids\r\nare in bunches, sometimes below the outer row of tentacles, sometimes\r\nbetween the two rows. The perisarc does not cover the zoöid. In color\r\nthey are commonly red or yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Clava^\r\n\r\n  ^C. leptostyla.^ This species is found growing on /Fucus/, on the\r\n  under side of stones at low-water mark, and in tide-pools, where\r\n  it often covers several feet of the surface of the rock with a\r\n  delicate velvet-like carpet. It is red in color and is, apparently,\r\n  a soft and tender species, but it thrives on the most exposed\r\n  beaches. The colonies are cylindrical tubes about one quarter of an\r\n  inch in height, rising from a creeping stem (/hydrorhiza/). Each\r\n  tube is surmounted by a zoöid with fifteen to thirty tentacles,\r\n  which is constantly changing form by its contractions. Below the\r\n  tentacles are reproductive buds arranged in clusters. Common from\r\n  Long Island Sound northward. (Plate XLI.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLI. Clava leptostyla. Tubularia indivisa.\r\nHybocodon prolifer. Coryne mirabilis. Eudendrium ramosum. Tubularia\r\nCouthouyi.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Hydractinia^\r\n\r\n  ^H. polyclina.^ The soft, pinkish covering often seen on shells\r\n  inhabited by hermit-crabs. This association of two different\r\n  kinds of animals is known as /commensalism/, and is a partnership\r\n  formed for the benefit of one or both the individuals. In this\r\n  case the mossy appearance of the hydroid conceals the shell,\r\n  while the stinging-cells with which it is invested are weapons of\r\n  defense against the enemies of the crab and also help to paralyze\r\n  its prey. In return for these favors the colony is moved about,\r\n  thereby obtaining perhaps better oxygenation. Originally it was\r\n  thought that /Hydractinia/ lived only on the shells occupied by\r\n  hermit-crabs, and that the nomadic life was essential to its\r\n  existence; but this is not the case, for it is also found growing\r\n  on rocks in tide-pools. These colonies arise from a creeping stem,\r\n  which forms a horny, root-like [pg123] network over a surface\r\n  and develops at intervals projecting points on which the zoöids\r\n  live. Each colony consists of feeding members, of reproductive\r\n  members, and of a third kind which seems to have a protective\r\n  function. These last are more slender than the others, and are\r\n  without tentacles, but are armed with lasso- or stinging-cells. The\r\n  colonies are of different sexes, the male being lighter in color\r\n  than the female colonies. The eggs develop into planulæ, which swim\r\n  about for a while and then give rise to other colonies. It is found\r\n  from New Jersey northward, and is very abundant in Long Island\r\n  Sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Coryne^\r\n\r\n  ^C. mirabilis.^ A hydroid about one inch high, growing in patches\r\n  and appearing like tufts of moss on rocks between tide-marks.\r\n  When highly magnified it shows club-shaped tubes with pedicels,\r\n  terminating in zoöids, scattered over the swollen ends. The\r\n  medusa-bud is larger than the others and is lower on the tube. It\r\n  liberates a swimming-bell, which is called /Sarsia/. (Plate XLI.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colony of /Coryne/, natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n^Sarsia^\r\n\r\n  ^S. mirabilis.^ This medusa of /Coryne/ is from one quarter to\r\n  three quarters of an inch in diameter when full-grown. Its umbrella\r\n  is nearly hemispherical, and from the center hangs a manubrium.\r\n  From the margin of the umbrella hang four very long tentacles. The\r\n  shape of its body and the length of its tentacles and proboscis are\r\n  constantly changing as it moves in the water. These little medusæ\r\n  are very plentiful in the spring and summer, and swim rapidly in\r\n  all directions near the surface of the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Sarsia/, the free medusa of /Coryne/.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Tubularia^\r\n\r\n  ^T. Couthouyi.^ This species is found in the same places as\r\n  /Parypha crocea/. The stem is three to six inches long, and is\r\n  inclosed in a horny sheath, which is more or less ringed or\r\n  jointed, or it may be smooth throughout. The head, when the\r\n  tentacles are expanded, measures one and a half inches in diameter.\r\n  It has a proboscis covered with tentacles, disposed in series,\r\n  which grow successively shorter, the last being merely papillæ. The\r\n  medusa-buds hang in clusters between the outer tentacles and the\r\n  proboscis. The animal grows in bunches of five to ten tubes, which\r\n  spring from a creeping, tangled stem. (Plate XLI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Parypha^\r\n\r\n  ^P. crocea.^ This is one of the most beautiful of the tubularians.\r\n  It has a large, drooping head on a stem three to [pg124] four\r\n  inches long. It is bright red in color, and from the center of the\r\n  circle of tentacles the reproductive zoöids hang in a cluster, like\r\n  a bunch of grapes. It does not liberate swimming-bells. It is found\r\n  in bunches on piles of wharves and bridges, in brackish water, on\r\n  the eastern coast as far south as Charleston, South Carolina.\r\n\r\n  ^Corymorpha pendula.^ See Plate XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Hybocodon^\r\n\r\n  ^H. prolifer.^ One of the largest tubularians, somewhat resembling\r\n  /Parypha crocea/. It is deep orange in color, and the head is\r\n  erect on a long stem. The reproductive zoöids are in a cluster in\r\n  the center of a double row of tentacles, and resemble a basket of\r\n  fruit. It grows singly, or in groups of two or three, in shaded\r\n  tide-pools, which are protected from the surf, and in which the\r\n  water is very pure. It is found on the Massachusetts coast, but is\r\n  not common. This species liberates swimming-bells. (Plate XLI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pennaria^\r\n\r\n  ^P. tiarella.^ The branches are arranged alternately and at right\r\n  angles to a central stem or axis; they taper, being shortest at\r\n  the top and bottom of the stem. The zoöids are red in color, and\r\n  are arranged along the upper side of branches at considerable\r\n  intervals. The stems are black and beaded, being constricted at\r\n  intervals. The zoöids have two rows of tentacles, the upper ones\r\n  on a small proboscis. From the lower part of the proboscis deep,\r\n  bell-shaped bodies, which eventually become swimming-bells, are\r\n  developed. The species is found on rocks and eel-grass along the\r\n  whole eastern coast.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Pennaria tiarella/; a branch, natural size.]\r\n\r\n  ^P. gibbosa.^ A species similar to /P. tiarella/, found on the\r\n  coast of Florida.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLII. Corymorpha pendula. Clytia bicophora.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLII, A. Obelia longissima. Clytia poterium.\r\nSertularia pumila.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Bougainvillea^\r\n\r\n  ^B. superciliaris.^ This hydroid is found in tide-pools on the\r\n  New England coast, growing in clusters, about two inches high,\r\n  attached to rocks or to mussel-shells. The stem is very slender,\r\n  and branches. It is red in color. The medusæ which it liberates\r\n  are found in great numbers in the spring. The tiny swimming-bells\r\n  are nearly globular. The tentacles are long, are arranged in\r\n  four clusters on the margin, and extend in every direction. The\r\n  manubrium is yellow and short, and the mouth is concealed by four\r\n  clusters of short tentacles. On these oral tentacles [pg125]\r\n  the eggs of the animal are produced. In its habits it is sluggish,\r\n  often remaining in one position for several days.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPANULARIANS\r\n\r\nThe hydroids which have an open, bell-shaped cup at the termination\r\nof a short, stalk-like stem, or branchlet, are mostly campanularians.\r\nThis division embraces jellyfishes of different families. Many medusæ\r\ncannot be referred with certainty to the hydroids from which they\r\nsprang, and the medusa-buds of many of the hydroids have not been\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Obelia^ (Plate XLII, A)\r\n\r\n  ^O. commissuralis.^ This is a delicate, much-branched hydroid, five\r\n  to six inches long, found at low-water mark in tide-pools, attached\r\n  to stones and seaweeds, along the rocky shores from Nova Scotia\r\n  to South Carolina. Its branches are arranged spirally and spread\r\n  nearly at right angles to the main stem, and the main branches\r\n  subdivide in a similar manner. Every interval of the stem has a\r\n  slight curve, and at the base of every branch there are four or\r\n  five rings. The ultimate branches, or pedicels, bear at their ends\r\n  bell-shaped cups which have even edges, but are twelve-sided and\r\n  slightly incurved. The pedicels are ringed for the whole length.\r\n  The reproductive cups on short ringed pedicels are larger than\r\n  the others, and occupy the angles of the branches. These cups are\r\n  constricted and again expanded at the apex, forming an urn-like top.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Eucope^\r\n\r\n  ^E. diaphana.^ This species is often abundant on the fronds of\r\n  /Laminaria/ washed ashore, and also on /Rhodymenia/ and /Fucus/.\r\n  It has a creeping base, zigzag in form, but keeping a straight\r\n  course, and in its branching often forming a network over the\r\n  surface of the flat fronds. At each angle of the creeping stems\r\n  rises a pedicel about an inch high, which inclines in the direction\r\n  of the stem and terminates in a zoöid-cup similar in form to that\r\n  of /Obelia/. The medusa which this hydroid liberates is called\r\n  /Thaumatias diaphana/. The swimming-bell is very shallow and thin,\r\n  turning inside out at almost every pulsation. The tentacles are\r\n  numerous and rigid like stiff hairs. This little medusa is very\r\n  active and is abundant. The species is found from Long Island Sound\r\n  northward.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Oceania^\r\n\r\n  ^O. languida.^ This medusa is one inch in diameter and one half of\r\n  an inch high, and is so delicate and transparent that it is hardly\r\n  visible except in its outlines. In its early stages it is nearly\r\n  spherical and has no tentacles; later the disk flattens and has\r\n  from thirty-two to thirty-six [pg126] tentacles and numerous\r\n  eye-spots. When disturbed it flattens its disk and folds together,\r\n  leaving its tentacles sprawled in every direction. It is very\r\n  languid in its movements, and often remains in one position for\r\n  hours. These medusæ are found only in the hottest hours of the day,\r\n  but are very plentiful then, shoals of them often stretching for\r\n  miles, and so thick as to touch one another. Their habitat is the\r\n  New England coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Clytia^\r\n\r\n  ^C. poterium.^ This hydroid is found creeping over seaweeds in\r\n  tide-pools from Long Island Sound northward. The main stem is\r\n  prostrate, or root-like, running over the body to which it is\r\n  attached. The stems rise as do the tubularians. The sterile zoöids\r\n  are on single stems about one quarter of an inch high. The stems\r\n  are faintly ringed for their entire length, and at the top have\r\n  a distinct ring, on which rests an open, bell-shaped cup, which\r\n  is smooth around the rim. The reproductive zoöids are on very\r\n  short pedicels, and the cups are long and cylindrical, with a wavy\r\n  outline. (Plate XLII, A.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. bicophora.^ This species is found in the same places as the\r\n  preceding, and is of about the same size. The long stems are more\r\n  or less ringed and sometimes branched. The edges of the cups are\r\n  notched. The medusa-buds are urn-shaped and ringed, and are on very\r\n  short pedicels. (Plate XLII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SERTULARIANS\r\n\r\nThe sertularians are distinguished by the horny cup, which is\r\nsessile--that is, set directly against the stem instead of being\r\nraised upon a stalk. They are among the most common objects of the\r\nbeach, and, like the plumularians, are often mistaken for plants by\r\nthe amateur collector and are gathered and pressed as seaweeds. They\r\nare found everywhere along the coast. They zigzag over the fronds of\r\nseaweeds or hang in fringes upon them, as well as upon rocks, stones,\r\nand shells. They well repay close examination with a glass. Every\r\nopen cup bears a wreath of tentacles, which makes the branch a spray\r\nof stars. This is not an inappropriate comparison, for besides their\r\nstarry shape some species emit a phosphorescent light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLII, B. Sertularia argentea. Sertularia\r\ncupressina.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLIII. Plumularian hydroid. Aglaophemia\r\nstruthioides. Aglaophemia struthioides, magnified. Plumularia\r\nfalcata.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Sertularia^\r\n\r\n  ^S. pumila.^ The most abundant of all the hydroids on the northeast\r\n  coast is this species, which is found in profusion upon /Fucus/\r\n  and other seaweeds, and mingled with them upon the rocks. It\r\n  is easily distinguished from the campanularians because its\r\n  zoöid-cups are close against the stems (sessile) instead of on\r\n  stalks or pedicels. The stem creeps [pg127] over the fronds\r\n  of seaweeds, often crossing and recrossing in a tangled mass. At\r\n  short intervals the upright, straight branches rise to one inch or\r\n  one and a half inches in height, and are more or less branched.\r\n  All except the creeping stems are close set on each side, with\r\n  cylindrical zoöid-cups which turn outward at the ends. The cups of\r\n  the reproductive zoöids are not sessile; they are much larger than\r\n  those of the nutritive ones and are urn-shaped. (Plate XLII, A.)\r\n\r\n  ^S. argentea.^ This is a beautiful species, common from New Jersey\r\n  northward. It has a profusion of silvery branches on a dark stem.\r\n  The colonies are often a foot or more long, and the branches at\r\n  the top and bottom of the stem are shorter and fewer than those in\r\n  the middle of the colony. The zoöid-cups are nearly cylindrical,\r\n  pressed closely to the stem, nearly opposite or subalternate to one\r\n  another, and end in pointed tips. The medusa-bud is urn-shaped,\r\n  with two horns at the top. (Plate XLII, B.)\r\n\r\n  ^S. cupressina^, the sea-cypress. This species is similar to\r\n  /S. argentea/, but the main stem is thicker and longer, and the\r\n  branches less crowded and less subdivided. The branches are arched\r\n  or drooping, instead of straight, and gradually decrease in length\r\n  at some distance from the lower and upper parts of the stem,\r\n  giving a spire-like apex, the stem often continuing into a bare,\r\n  branchless extremity. The zoöid-cups are tubular, not much narrowed\r\n  or divergent above, and two-lipped on the margin. It is found from\r\n  New Jersey northward. (Plate XLII, B.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLUMULARIANS\r\n\r\nThese hydroids are feather-like in the manner of branching, short\r\nlateral branches being arranged on each side of a long central stem.\r\nIn some species the stems are naked below and resemble quills. The\r\nzoöid-cups are only on one side of the short branches. (Plate XLIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Aglaophemia^\r\n\r\n  ^A. struthioides^, the ostrich-plume. This species, which is\r\n  found on the Pacific coast, is perhaps the most beautiful of the\r\n  hydroids. It varies in size and color, but always suggests a small\r\n  ostrich-plume. The zoöid-cups are arranged in a single row on one\r\n  side of each short branch, and the main stem has a joint between\r\n  each of the branches, which are placed quite close together. The\r\n  rims of the cups have sharp-pointed teeth, and from the top emerge\r\n  three tubular projections, which are called /nematophores/, and are\r\n  supposed to be degenerate zoöids. At intervals a branch is replaced\r\n  by a cylindrical body covered with nematophores, and in these the\r\n  generative zoöids are developed. (Plate XLIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Plumularia^\r\n\r\n  ^P. falcata^ (Johnston), or ^Hydrallmania falcata^ (Hincks). This\r\n  species is found on shells and rocks near low-water mark from Long\r\n  [pg128] Island Sound northward. It is from four to twelve inches\r\n  high. The main stem is in long spiral turns, and at intervals has\r\n  spreading plumose branches. The zoöid-cups are tubular and closely\r\n  pressed against one another, and are ranged in rows on one side of\r\n  the branchlets; the apertures of the cups are plain and oblique.\r\n  (Plate XLIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~GERYONOPSIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Tima^\r\n\r\n  ^T. formosa.^ A very delicate and transparent medusa; size one to\r\n  two inches in diameter; bell conical; radial tubes four in number;\r\n  manubrium long, hanging far below the disk; four frilled appendages\r\n  diverging from the corners of the mouth; tentacles thirty-two;\r\n  egg-sacs white and following the line of the radial tubes in\r\n  undulating folds.

Found north of Cape Cod in July.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =TRACHYLINÆ=\r\n\r\nThe /Trachymedusæ/ are characterized by their direct development, the\r\negg of the jellyfish producing a medusa and not a hydroid colony.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Trachynema^\r\n\r\n  ^T. digitale.^ Size one inch to one and a half inches in height;\r\n  rose-colored; the bell thin and hard, and conical at the top. The\r\n  swimming is effected by contractions of the muscular velum (the\r\n  band around the inner margin of the umbrella) instead of wholly by\r\n  the bell. The tentacles are long and numerous, and are curled up\r\n  when moving. The manubrium is long and has four expansions at the\r\n  mouth. Eight egg-cases [pg129] hang in long pendent sacs from the\r\n  upper part of the radial canals and reach nearly to the velum. Four\r\n  garnet-colored eyes in club-shaped processes are prominent on the\r\n  margin. The animal moves by jerks in straight lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =HYDROCORALLINA=\r\n\r\nCALCAREOUS HYDROIDS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Trachynema digitale./]\r\n\r\nThe genus ^Millepora^ (\"thousand pores\"), which is the type of this\r\norder, is a colony of animals, like other hydroids, which secrete\r\ncalcareous instead of horny coverings. It differs from true corals\r\nin that the members of a colony perform different functions, whereas\r\nin true corals each member of a community is a complete individual.\r\nIt differs also in the arrangement of the stony partitions, which in\r\n=Hydrocorallina= are the outside coverings and connecting canals, but\r\nin true corals are vertical partitions inside the animal, between the\r\ninner and outer sacs, as explained on page 114.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Millepora^\r\n\r\n  ^M. alcicornis^, elk-horn coral. This beautiful coral, which is\r\n  abundant in Florida and contributes to the building of the reefs,\r\n  rises in broad expansions, more or less lobed, and suggests by its\r\n  shape the object for which it is named. The whole mass is porous,\r\n  being traversed by innumerable canals. Its surface, although\r\n  smooth compared with that of other corals, is covered with very\r\n  minute pores, which are of two sizes. The larger ones are the\r\n  /gastropores/, or stomach-pores, in which the nutritive animal\r\n  lives; it has a cylindrical body, with four knob-like tentacles and\r\n  a mouth. Placed more or less irregularly around the gastropores are\r\n  smaller pores, the /dactylopores/ (finger-pores), from which emerge\r\n  slender mouthless processes, or /dactylozoöids/, with tentacles and\r\n  stinging-cells. These seem to be the guard-polyps of the community.\r\n  The cups occupied by the zoöids are shallow. As one animal dies,\r\n  another succeeds it and builds a horizontal partition separating\r\n  the new cup from the old one. Thus the stony mass increases in size\r\n  by the progress of succeeding generations of zoöids. The living\r\n  animal occupies only the outer, open space. (Plate XLIV.) [pg130]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =SIPHONOPHORA=\r\n\r\nFREE-SWIMMING COLONIES\r\n\r\nThis order of hydroids consists of free-floating communities and\r\nis one of peculiar interest, since it shows in a clear manner the\r\nspecial function of each individual member of the colony, and\r\nillustrates better than the foregoing, perhaps, the curious forms of\r\nanimal life which this class presents.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Nanomia^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Adult /Nanomia cara/.]\r\n\r\n  ^N. cara.^ This species is found on the New England coast. The\r\n  members of the community are arranged along a hollow stem about\r\n  three inches long which opens into every individual. At the top\r\n  of the stem is a sac, or float; just below this is a group of\r\n  swimming-bells which have no manubrium or mouth, and whose sole\r\n  function is to provide locomotion for the community; and below\r\n  these are three sets of zoöids, each having a triangular shield\r\n  and tentacles. The tentacles are longer than the main stem. One of\r\n  these last groups consists of the nutritive members, the mouths\r\n  of the community, resembling manubriums of swimming-bells out of\r\n  place. Each one has at the point of attachment a bunch of long,\r\n  delicate tentacles having pendent knobs of lasso-cells. A second\r\n  group, also with mouths, has shorter tentacles which are carried in\r\n  spiral coils. The members of the third group have but one tentacle\r\n  each and resemble the float at the end of the stem; presumably\r\n  these drop off and produce new colonies. There are also on the\r\n  lower part of the stem other reproductive members, which resemble\r\n  the clusters of buds seen on [pg131] tubularian hydroids. These\r\n  animals are pink in color and move through the water with a\r\n  graceful swaying motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Physalia^\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Physalia arethusa/; Portuguese man-of-war, one fifth\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\n  ^P. arethusa^, the Portuguese man-of-war. This colony is perhaps\r\n  the best-known one of the group, since it attracts much attention\r\n  in Southern waters, and is also one of the most remarkable\r\n  examples of an animal community. The most prominent part of the\r\n  compound body is the float, an oblong pear-shaped bag, full of\r\n  air, which floats on the surface of the water. Its color is bright\r\n  blue, varying to rose. On the upper side of this air-vessel is a\r\n  crest, or sail, and from the under side depend long tentacles, or\r\n  streamers. Some of these tentacles are covered with stinging- or\r\n  lasso-cells; some are the feeding zoöids, with flask-shaped\r\n  bodies, and some, which look like bunches of grapes, are the\r\n  reproductive zoöids. The tentacles in this curious cluster are\r\n  all close together and hang from one side of the float, near the\r\n  broader end. The longest are on the outside, which may be called\r\n  the windward side, since they serve to keep the crest, or sail,\r\n  before the wind; and when the wind is strong they stretch out to\r\n  a remarkable length,--forty to fifty feet,--acting as anchors to\r\n  keep the colony from being driven ashore. They also change its\r\n  course by raising the pointed end of the float, thus forcing it to\r\n  \"come about.\" These long tentacles, ordinarily carried more or less\r\n  curled up, are in bunches of two to four, and emerge from a common\r\n  stem. Clusters of similar, but smaller, tentacles alternate with\r\n  the larger ones, but grow somewhat nearer the pointed end of the\r\n  float; these are purely locomotive organs. Next come two smaller\r\n  sets of appendages, also of unequal size, which are the nutritive\r\n  organs of the community. They are clustered together on a stem like\r\n  the others. The appendages of the third kind are small, resemble\r\n  bunches of grapes, and are scattered among the nutritive hydræ.\r\n  These last are the reproductive zoöids of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Vellela^\r\n\r\n  ^V. limbosa.^ This hydroid is abundant on the Florida coast. It\r\n  has a bright-blue, flattened, oblong, bladder-like float, four to\r\n  five inches [pg132] long, which, is divided into a number of\r\n  concentric, communicating compartments. The margin of the float is\r\n  entire, and a triangular sail extends diagonally across the top. On\r\n  the under side is a single mouth on a manubrium, and surrounding it\r\n  are a large number of short thread-like appendages having different\r\n  functions. Some of them are feelers, others bear reproductive buds,\r\n  and others have stinging-cells. Associated with /Vellela/ is an\r\n  allied hydroid called /Porpita/, which has no sail, and in company\r\n  with these two is a jellyfish called /Rataria/, which is supposed\r\n  to be the offspring of one or the other of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Vellela limbosa./]\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE SCYPHOZOA DESCRIBED IN THIS\r\nCHAPTER\r\n\r\n  Class =SCYPHOZOA= (/Velum usually absent and tentaculocysts\r\n    present; the eggs are discharged into a gastric cavity.

Its transparency, its graceful rhythmical movements,\r\nits long streaming tentacles, the variety and eccentricity of its\r\nform, and often of its color, attract attention, and one naturally\r\ndesires to know something of its life-history. Jellyfishes are also\r\ncalled /medusæ/, because their long appendages suggest the locks of\r\nthe Gorgon; /acalephs/, on account of their stinging or nettle-like\r\nproperties; and sun-jellies, sea-blubbers, etc., because they float\r\nupon the surface during the warmest part of the day, when the sun is\r\nhigh. The name /jellyfish/ is inappropriate, since the animal in no\r\nway resembles a fish except in the fact that it swims; but it is,\r\nnevertheless, the commonest name.\r\n\r\nJellyfishes vary in size from that of a pinhead to six or seven\r\nfeet in diameter. They differ in the number, size, and position of\r\nthe tentacles, the number of the radial canals, the form of the\r\nmanubrium, the position of the egg-sacs, etc.; but the general plan\r\nof the internal structure is the same in all species. In shape they\r\nare compared to a mushroom. From the center of an umbrella-like top\r\nfalls a central organ like the stalk of a mushroom. It is called the\r\n/manubrium/ and is the mouth and stomach of the animal.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the manubrium radiate straight or branched tubes,\r\nwhich are connected with a canal which runs around the whole margin\r\nof the umbrella. Extending around the inner circumference of the\r\ndisk in certain species (usually the hydroid medusæ), there is a\r\nhorizontal shelf, called the /velum/, or veil, because it sometimes\r\nfalls like a veil. [pg135]\r\n\r\nFrom the margin of the umbrella depend the tentacles. There are\r\nlittle mineral deposits, like crystals, called /lithocysts/, disposed\r\nat intervals on the margin, and known also as /marginal bodies/,\r\nwhich are supposed to be eyes. In some species these lithocysts\r\nare inclosed in club-shaped bodies, and they are then called\r\n/tentaculocysts/, because they are like small tentacles. These,\r\ntogether with the nerve-fibers, are called the sense-organs; but to\r\nwhat extent jellyfishes can see and feel is undetermined. This is\r\nthe first appearance of sense-organs in animals. Around the concave\r\nsurface of the umbrella is a muscular zone, or zone of contractile\r\ntissue, by which the animal opens and shuts the umbrella and gets its\r\nlocomotive power. The /gonads/, which are conspicuous from being more\r\nopaque than the rest of the body, are the egg- or sperm-sacs. They\r\nvary in form and in position.\r\n\r\nThe jellyfish is carnivorous, feeding on small organisms such\r\nas crustaceans and even fishes. The tentacles are invested with\r\nstinging-cells, as are also the frills about the mouth, when such\r\noccur. With these stinging-cells, which are in some species so\r\npowerful as to have been compared with an electric battery, the\r\njellyfish benumbs its prey. The stinging properties are due to\r\nnettle-like threads contained in poison-cells. When these penetrate\r\nthe flesh they produce a pain similar to that of an electric shock.\r\n\r\nThe food is taken into the manubrium by the square mouth at its\r\nfree end, and is there digested. It is then sent as nutritive fluid\r\nthrough the canal system of the body, and ejected through small pores\r\nin the canal which surrounds the margin of the umbrella.\r\n\r\nThere are two sexes. The gonads of the female contain eggs; those of\r\nthe male, sperms. The contents of the gonads drop into the central\r\ncavity and pass out through the mouth. The fertilized ovum is called\r\na /planula/, and is a transparent sphere covered with cilia, by\r\nmeans of which it swims about for a time. At length it attaches\r\nitself to some object, and becomes in some species a branching colony\r\n(hydroid), in other species a /strobila/. The latter, as it grows,\r\nis constricted at intervals, and at maturity resembles a pile of\r\ninverted saucers with lobed edges. Each of [pg136] these saucers\r\nis finally detached, and when liberated is called an /ephyrula/,\r\nand becomes a jellyfish. Thus its cycle of life is complete. There\r\nare some species which, having no hydroid or strobila state, mature\r\nwithout alternation of generation (/metagenesis/).\r\n\r\nThe term of life of the jellyfish does not exceed one year. Even the\r\ngiant /Cyanea/ attains its immense growth in six months. It starts\r\nin the spring as an ephyrula, not more than one half of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and when it dies in the autumn is often six to eight feet\r\nin diameter. The bodies of jellyfishes are ninety-nine per cent.\r\nwater, and the dead ones thrown upon the beaches by the autumn storms\r\nrapidly disappear, leaving no traces behind.\r\n\r\nThe powerful stinging-cells with which the large medusæ are armed\r\nmake them formidable enemies, and it is probable that some deaths\r\nby drowning are caused by swimmers encountering them and becoming\r\nparalyzed by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =STAUROMEDUSÆ=\r\n\r\n(\"/Cross-medusæ/\")\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Lucernaria^\r\n\r\n  ^L. auricula.^ This little iridescent jellyfish, which measures\r\n  about one and a half inches in diameter, is commonly found attached\r\n  to eel-grass by a stalk-like projection of the top of the umbrella.\r\n  Short, globe-tipped tentacles are arranged in eight clusters, each\r\n  cluster on a raised prolongation of the margin of the umbrella, and\r\n  in the center of each space between them is a dark kidney-shaped\r\n  organ called the /anchor/. These anchors are used for holding,\r\n  either for suspension or when moving from place to place. The\r\n  mouth forms a slight quadrangular projection in the center of the\r\n  bell-like expansion. The arm-like projections are mottled with\r\n  two rows of spots, which are the ova. Although a free form and\r\n  capable of moving about, /Lucernaria/ is sedentary in habit. It is\r\n  sometimes found free, but generally attached by its extremity to\r\n  eel-grass or /Fucus/, seldom to rocks. It is constantly changing\r\n  its shape. The one it most frequently assumes is that of a cup or\r\n  inverted bell. It is found on the New England coast.

Four tentacles fall from lobes on the umbrella, and\r\n  four club-shaped eyes are in marginal notches. Plate-like egg-sacs\r\n  follow each side of the four radial canals. The bell is one inch\r\n  in diameter and about two inches in height. It is not found on the\r\n  coasts of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =DISCOMEDUSÆ=\r\n\r\n(\"/Disk-medusæ/\")\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ~SEMOSTOMÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Aurelia^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Aurelia flavidula/, about one fourth natural size.]\r\n\r\n  ^A. flavidula.^ Size eight to ten inches in diameter; disk\r\n  gelatinous, transparent bluish-white, broad and comparatively flat,\r\n  with a fringe of short tentacles of even length around the margin;\r\n  margin broken by eight notches, in each one of which is a club-like\r\n  organ (/tentaculocyst/) containing calcareous spots or eyes, which\r\n  are hidden by lappets or hood-like coverings; groups of nerve-cells\r\n  also lie in the marginal notches; radial canals branched; manubrium\r\n  very short, with square mouth, which is surrounded by delicate\r\n  membranes, or oral arms, each arm being a folded membrane tapering\r\n  to a point. The edges of the membranes are covered with lasso- or\r\n  stinging-cells. Four egg-sacs, or gonads, are conspicuous in\r\n  horseshoe shape around the center of the disk. The gonads are\r\n  pink in the males, and yellow in the females. These medusæ swim\r\n  in shoals, and are common everywhere in summer. They may be said\r\n  to be annual animals, for they make their appearance regularly as\r\n  free-swimming medusæ in the latter part of April, when they may be\r\n  seen in immense numbers near the surface when the water is smooth\r\n  and the sky clear. At this time they are about an inch in diameter.\r\n  They grow rapidly, and by the end of June have attained their full\r\n  size. At [pg138] the end of July they are fully developed, and\r\n  begin to discharge their eggs, which go into the folds around the\r\n  mouth and remain there until they attain the planula stage. After\r\n  the spawning period the medusæ, reduced in strength, are unable\r\n  to resist the storms of the autumn, and many of them are cast\r\n  ashore; many others, in a more or less wasted condition, float\r\n  near the surface, but the body is less transparent, its tissues\r\n  are thickened, its tentacles gone, and general dissolution has\r\n  commenced. In this condition the medusæ are frequently capsized by\r\n  the air which accumulates in the empty egg-cavities, and, floating\r\n  helplessly on the surface, are attacked and destroyed by swarms of\r\n  small crustaceans; thus their cycle of life is terminated. It has\r\n  been suggested that the destruction of the mothers, by being cast\r\n  upon the beaches in the autumnal gales, is a provision to set free\r\n  the planulæ in a position favorable to their existence; for when\r\n  liberated they fasten upon the rocks and seaweeds of the shore,\r\n  where, during the winter months, they develop into strobilæ, which\r\n  in turn free their saucer-like disks early in April.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Strobila of /Aurelia flavidula/.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cyanea^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Cyanea arctica/, greatly reduced in size.]\r\n\r\n  ^C. arctica^, the sun-jelly or sea-blubber. This is the largest\r\n  jellyfish known. Some individuals measure seven and a half feet\r\n  across the disk and have tentacles more than one hundred feet long.\r\n  Usually they are three to five feet in diameter, with tentacles\r\n  thirty to forty feet long. The disk is red, the margin white and\r\n  scalloped. The tentacles, of different colors, are covered with\r\n  lasso- or stinging-cells, and are arranged in eight distinct,\r\n  thick clusters on the margin. From the mouth hang four long and\r\n  very broad, thin curtains, much folded and ruffled, whose edges at\r\n  times look as if they were embroidered, because great numbers of\r\n  discharged eggs are attached to them. Four egg-sacs hang from the\r\n  disk near the manubrium, and eight sense-organs (tentaculocysts),\r\n  in hardened coverings, lie in some of the deep incisions of the\r\n  margin. /Cyanea/ [pg139] is usually solitary, seldom being seen\r\n  in company with others. It is common on the New England coast,\r\n  and is frequently found stranded on the beach, where it in no way\r\n  suggests the beautiful appearance it presents when floating in\r\n  the water. Like /Aurelia/, /Cyanea/ has a strobila stage. It is\r\n  supposed that the young remain near the bottom, for they are seldom\r\n  seen, while adults are plentiful. They begin to appear in numbers\r\n  at the end of summer from Cape Cod northward.\r\n\r\n  ^C. fulva.^ This species is found in midsummer south of Cape Cod\r\n  and is common in Long Island Sound. Its general color is light\r\n  yellowish-brown, the flowing curtains being the darkest part of\r\n  the animal.

(See next page.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ~RHIZOSTOMÆ~\r\n\r\nThe =Rhizostomæ=, or root-mouth jellyfishes, are very remarkable.\r\nThey have no tentacles, but covering the end of the manubrium and\r\nhanging from it like tentacles are oval appendages with numerous\r\nminute funnel-like apertures, called suctorial mouths. As the manner\r\nof locomotion of jellyfishes is peculiar to themselves, so also is\r\nthis many-mouthed development unique in the animal kingdom. The\r\ntype of this group, described below, is found on the Florida Keys.\r\nThe different species vary in diameter from three to eight inches.\r\n[pg140]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cassiopeia^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Pelagia cyanella./]\r\n\r\n  ^C. frondosa.^ This species has a circular disk, on the margin of\r\n  which are sixteen sense-organs (tentaculocysts), but no tentacles.\r\n  The lower end of the manubrium, which in other jellyfishes is\r\n  an open mouth, is closed by eight arms which emanate from it\r\n  and are usually extended laterally, lying parallel to the disk.\r\n  These arms are much branched, and the branches, in turn, have\r\n  numerous appendages. Some of these appendages look like little\r\n  polyps and have mouths surrounded by crowns of tentacles; others\r\n  are ovoid bodies without external openings, but with a central\r\n  cavity connected with vessels leading to the arms. The former are\r\n  mouths, but the function of the ovoid bodies is not known. Although\r\n  able to swim freely, /Cassiopeia/ lies usually on its back, as if\r\n  attached, and languidly opens and closes its disk, rarely changing\r\n  its position. Its arms, extending upward, appear like the fronds of\r\n  algæ. These jellyfishes are common on the Florida coast, huddled\r\n  together on the sands of the coral reefs. (Plate XLIV.)

The polyps of a colony\r\nare all alike, and the hard matter they secrete is carbonate of lime.\r\nIn the second subdivision, the /Alcyonaria/,--or halcyonoids, as they\r\nare commonly called,--the tentacles and radial partitions are always\r\neight in number, and the tentacles have small symmetrical appendages\r\nor branches. The polyps of this group are often accompanied by\r\nsmall zoöids having no tentacles. The hard secretions are horny\r\nand elastic, as in sea-fans, sea-whips, and sea-pens, or they are\r\nextremely hard, as in /Corallina rubrum/.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCLASS =ZOANTHARIA=\r\n\r\n(\"/Animal-flowers/\")\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =ACTINIARIA=\r\n\r\nSEA-ANEMONES\r\n\r\nThese curious and, at times, beautiful creatures are polyps, and are\r\nconstructed on the radial system. They have a cylindrical body with\r\na broad base and rows of hollow tentacles around the upper disk.\r\nThey have a central sac, and a space between the outer and inner\r\nsacs which is divided vertically by walls called /mesenteries/, as\r\nexplained on page 114. Each tentacle, however many there [pg143] may\r\nbe, has a corresponding chamber. The inner sac has a mouth, like a\r\nslit, at the top of the disk, opening to the outside, and it also has\r\nopenings into the chambered spaces which surround it. These chambers\r\nalso open into the hollow tentacles; thus a continuous circulation\r\nthroughout the whole animal is established.\r\n\r\nThe food taken in at the mouth is digested in the inner sac, passes\r\nthrough all the chambers of the cavity as nutritive fluid, and is\r\nthen expelled at the mouth again. The inner sac, or gullet, has\r\nlongitudinal grooves; two of these are broad and deep, and correspond\r\nto the corners of the mouth. These are called /siphonoglyphs/. The\r\nsea-anemone is soft and contractile, and belongs to the only order\r\nof this class which does not secrete a skeleton. It has two sets of\r\nmuscles, one of which extends from the base to the summit of the body\r\nand is placed on the dividing partitions. Sea-anemones are classified\r\nby the arrangement of the septa and the manner in which the muscles\r\nare placed upon them. The other set of muscles is arranged around\r\nthe circumference of the column or body. Each tentacle is furnished\r\nwith similar sets of muscles. The animal is sensitive, and at the\r\nleast alarm contracts its body by means of these muscles, and\r\nquickly transforms itself from a beautiful, flower-like form into a\r\nshapeless, unattractive, inconspicuous mass.\r\n\r\nThe /Actiniaria/ are developed from the egg. The eggs form on the\r\nedges of the inner walls (mesenteries), and when mature drop into\r\nthe outer sac (gullet), and out of the mouth as ciliated spheres\r\n(planulæ). After swimming about for a time these attach themselves to\r\nrocks, and, conforming to the irregularities of the surface, secure a\r\ntight hold. The upper surface of the planula then becomes depressed\r\nand forms a gullet, and in time a complete animal is formed. The\r\n/Actiniaria/ reproduce also by budding. A small protuberance or\r\nsimple elevation of the body-wall appears on the side at the base,\r\nor in some species on the disk of the animal, which generally\r\ndevelops into a complete animal and at maturity falls away from the\r\nparent. Sometimes several anemones bud simultaneously from the same\r\nindividual, and a third generation commences to bud at the same\r\ntime from the immature young of the parent stock. The sea-anemones\r\nincrease [pg144] also by self-division. In this case a constriction\r\nis formed, which gradually deepens and forms a complete partition of\r\nthe body, and two individuals exist where originally there was but\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe /Actiniaria/ are carnivorous and very voracious. They feed\r\non small organisms and on shell-fish and crustaceans, which they\r\nsuck out of their shells. To secure their prey they are armed with\r\nan abundant supply of stinging-cells on the tentacles, and also\r\nwith fine stinging-threads which are ejected from pores which are\r\ndistributed over the whole body.\r\n\r\nSea-anemones vary greatly in color and form, and when expanded\r\nsuggest flowers, but do not resemble the one for which they are\r\nnamed. They abound on every shore, the same genus often being found\r\nin widely separated regions. They are larger and more highly colored\r\nin tropical waters. Many of the species are littoral, and are found\r\nin the tide-pools of rocky caverns, on the under side of rocks, and\r\non the piles of wharves and bridges at low-water mark. The majority\r\nof them are attached, but are able to change their location; others,\r\n/Edwardsia/ and /Cerianthus/, swim about when young, and in the\r\nadult state burrow in the sand or mud, leaving only their tentacles\r\nexposed. /Bucidium parasiticum/ is parasitic on the folds of the\r\nmembrane which hangs from the mouth of the large jellyfish /Cyanea\r\narctica/. /Fenja/ and /Peachia/ lie on the sea-bottom, with their\r\nbodies horizontal like a worm, the mouth-end and tentacles erect.\r\n\r\n/Adamsia palliata/ furnishes another example of commensalism; it\r\nlives on the back of shells, commonly the whelk, inhabited by\r\nhermit-crabs. /Minyas/ is pelagic; it has a float at one end, and by\r\nmeans of its tentacles swims about freely.\r\n\r\nA very few species only are described below, since these polyps are\r\nunmistakable, being always columnar bodies, with the upper disk more\r\nor less crowded with tentacles, and so brilliant in coloring and\r\nbeautiful in form as to attract attention if found in the expanded\r\nstate; otherwise they are easily overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Metridium^\r\n\r\n  ^M. marginatum.^ This is the most conspicuous and abundant\r\n  sea-anemone of the northeastern coast. It is common from New York\r\n  [pg145] northward, and is found near low-water mark in tide-pools,\r\n  on the under side of large stones, in sheltered crevices of rocks,\r\n  and on the piles of wharves and bridges. In contraction it is a\r\n  broad, low cone, but when expanded is sometimes ten inches across\r\n  the disk. Allied species found in Florida are eighteen inches in\r\n  diameter. The column is smooth, cylindrical, and broader than\r\n  long. At the top is a slightly elevated, thickened fold, and\r\n  above this a deeply folded and frilled margin, with numerous\r\n  fine, short tentacles, appearing like a fringe, which cover the\r\n  upper side of the disk half-way to the oval mouth. The color is\r\n  exceedingly variable; commonly the column is yellowish-brown, but\r\n  it may be pink, white, salmon, orange, or dark brown, or striped\r\n  or mottled with different colors. The disk and folds are lighter\r\n  or flesh-colored, and the tentacles are of varying colors, usually\r\n  grayish with tips of brighter colors. When irritated this species\r\n  throws out from the column numbers of long, slender white threads\r\n  (/acontia/), which are covered with minute stinging-cells. These\r\n  organs of defense protect the animal from the attacks of many\r\n  enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Rhodactinia^\r\n\r\n  ^R. davidsii^ (Agassiz), ^Tealia crassiformis^ (Gosse), the\r\n  thick-petaled rose-anemone. The color varies, being often\r\n  bluish-green mottled with crimson, often bright cherry-red, with\r\n  the thick tentacles somewhat lighter in shade, or flesh-colored.\r\n  The animal is found in shallow water. It assumes various shapes,\r\n  changing every few minutes. The tentacles are short, conical, and\r\n  uniform in size; the column, the breadth of which is greater than\r\n  its height, often has wart-like processes in longitudinal lines.\r\n  The diameter of the disk is about three inches. Found from Cape Cod\r\n  northward in tide-pools and on ledges covered with /Fucus/.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Holocampa^\r\n\r\n  ^H. producta.^ Its column, stretched to its full extent, is a foot\r\n  in length and about an inch in diameter, but when contracted is\r\n  much shorter and thicker. It has but twenty tentacles, and these\r\n  have swollen tips. Rows of suckers extend the length of the column.\r\n  It ranges from Cape Cod to South Carolina, and is found under rocks\r\n  at low-tide mark, and also on sandy beaches, buried in the sand,\r\n  with its tentacles only above the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Sagartia^\r\n\r\n  ^S. leucolena^, the white-armed anemone. It ranges from Cape Cod\r\n  to North Carolina, and is common in Long Island Sound, being found\r\n  at low-water mark on the under side of stones. The column is\r\n  elongated, cylindrical, translucent, flesh-colored, with simple\r\n  plain disk and long, slender, whitish tentacles crowded together\r\n  near the margin. [pg146]\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =MADREPORARIA=\r\n\r\nSTONE- OR REEF-CORALS\r\n\r\nThe coral resembles the sea-anemone and is a polyp constructed on the\r\nradial plan (page 113). It lives in colonies, but, unlike the hydroid\r\ncolonies, each polyp of the community is a complete organism, and\r\nin the reef-building corals all the individual polyps of a colony\r\nare alike. The home of each animal is called a /corallite/, and the\r\naggregation of many corallites is a /corallum/.\r\n\r\nThe corallite is composed of carbonate of lime secreted by the polyp,\r\nand, broadly speaking, may be called a skeleton. The secretion forms\r\na basal plate and radiating partitions between the mesenteries in\r\nthe cavity of the animal, and also surrounds the polyp like a cup.\r\nIn some species this is a solid substance; in others it is like a\r\nnetwork through which the animal substance (c[oe]nosarc) of the\r\nzoöids of the colony is connected, as in /Madrepora/.\r\n\r\nThe polyps reproduce by budding and by self-division (fission),\r\nin a manner similar to that of sea-anemones. The way in which the\r\nbudding or the fission takes place determines the shape of the\r\ncolony, or corallum, which has a great variety of forms. In some\r\nspecies the budding is confined to certain individuals of the colony.\r\nIn this case the branched forms result. When growth takes place by\r\nfission, hemispherical masses are formed, which are often perfectly\r\nsymmetrical, as in the so-called brain-corals. In /Astræa/ the polyps\r\nare inclosed separately, but in /Meandrina/ fission is confined to\r\nthe upper half of the polyps, so that a complex polyp is formed, with\r\nseveral mouths opening into a common stomach, making long serpentine\r\nfurrows on the corallum.\r\n\r\nSome of the genera of the second subdivision, the alcyonarians,\r\ndiffer materially from the ordinary idea of corals, as their\r\nframework is of a horny and more or less flexible material (chitin).\r\nOf these are the sea-fans, sea-whips, and sea-pens. The organ-pipe\r\ncoral of the same subdivision is an example of an exceedingly\r\nfragile lime structure, while the red coral, /Corallina rubrum/,\r\n[pg147] the species so much used for ornamental purposes, has an\r\nexceedingly hard and stony character. The madrepore corals are called\r\nreef-builders, but not in the sense of constructors of reefs. They do\r\nnot erect definite structures as bees do. It is the aggregation of\r\nthe skeletons of the dead polyps, together with other agencies, which\r\nforms a reef. The coral polyps, though so minute individually, are\r\nalmost infinite in numbers. It is estimated that the colonies rise\r\none half of an inch in ten years.\r\n\r\nCorals live at different depths in the sea. Those which form the base\r\nof the reef are the astræans, which do not live above a depth of six\r\nfathoms. They are characterized by little star-shaped spots on the\r\ncorallum, the radial partitions meeting in the center of the spots,\r\nor corallites. Next above the astræans come the mæandrinas and the\r\nporites. The former have elongated openings which extend in waving\r\nfurrows over the surface. The porites resemble astræans, but the pits\r\nare smaller, with fewer partitions, and the substance is more porous.\r\nAbove these and capping the reefs are the beautiful branching and\r\npalmate madreporians, together with millepores, numerous varieties of\r\nsea-fans (/Gorgonacea/), and the calcareous seaweeds (nullipores),\r\nmaking a garden of beautiful branching forms of every shape and color.\r\n\r\nThe coral reef is as thickly inhabited by other living organisms\r\nas is the forest by birds and insects. Mollusks, worms, crabs,\r\nstarfishes, and sea-urchins find resting-places there and work\r\ndestruction to the coral masses, as they bore and penetrate the reef\r\nin various ways until large fragments of it are detached and either\r\nwashed by the waves to places far from their foundation, or ground\r\nto sand, which, filling the interstices of the reef, adds to its\r\nsolidity.\r\n\r\nThe living coral is quite different in appearance from the bleached\r\nskeletons commonly seen. The surface of the corallum is often soft\r\nand downy, from the numerous waving tentacles, and its coloring is\r\nvivid and varied. The madrepores are pink, yellow, green, brown, and\r\npurple. /Tubipora/, the organ-pipe coral, has green polyps emanating\r\nfrom its red tubes. White polyps in star-like form dot the branches\r\nof the red coral of commerce, /Corallina rubrum/. The whole mass\r\nof /Helipora/ is bright blue, [pg148] and the beautiful sea-pens\r\nare both highly colored and phosphorescent. Owing to the fact that\r\nthese brilliantly colored polyps were mistaken for blossoms, the\r\nrecognition of their true character was long delayed, they having\r\nbeen ranked as vegetables until comparatively recent times.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions, corals do not grow in water below the\r\ntemperature of 68°, hence they are inhabitants of tropical and\r\nsubtropical waters. The Florida Keys are coral reefs, and the species\r\ndescribed below are to be found there.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Oculina^\r\n\r\nArborescent; corallites arranged somewhat spirally on branches and\r\nwidely separated; branches compact between corallites. Each bud is\r\nfor a time at the apex of the branch, but finally becomes lateral,\r\nand then gives off another bud from its upper surface, and so the\r\nstem lengthens. (Plate XLIV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Astræa^\r\n\r\nThe star-corals. The corals of this genus are hemispherical masses\r\ncovered with small star-shaped pits, or corallites. Although the\r\ndiameter of an astræa-dome may be twelve feet or more, it has only\r\none half or three quarters of an inch of living coral on its surface,\r\nthe rest being solid matter left behind as the polyps rose in growth.\r\nThe colony increases by self-division. The septa meet in the center\r\nof the corallite, making star-like pits; the surface is comparatively\r\nsmooth. (Plate XLIV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGenera ^Meandrina^, ^Diploria^\r\n\r\nCorallum massive, hemispherical in shape, with furrows running in\r\nirregular lines over the whole surface. The peculiar serpentine form\r\nof the corallite is produced by the animal growing in one direction,\r\nfission being incomplete, and new mouths being successively opened\r\nuntil a line of them extends along a common stomach.\r\n\r\n  ^D. cerebriformis.^ This species is commonly known as brain-coral\r\n  or brain-stone. The hemispherical shape, together with the peculiar\r\n  serpentine corallites, makes its resemblance to the human brain\r\n  very noticeable and the name unusually appropriate. This species,\r\n  when living, is bright yellow. (Plate XLV.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLIV. Millepora alcicornis. Lucernaria auricula.\r\nCassiopeia frondosa. Astræa argus. Oculina.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLV. Porites furcata and P. astræaoides. Diplora\r\ncerebriformis. Madrepora cervicornis. Madrepora palmata. Mycedium\r\nfragile.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Madrepora^\r\n\r\nSome species of these corals appear like branches, while others\r\nhave flat, low surfaces or fronds; all of them are covered with\r\ninnumerable small cylindrical cups. Each cup is the home of a polyp,\r\nwhich secretes calcareous matter around its column, and septa between\r\nits radial partitions. The corallum, when examined with a glass,\r\nlooks like meshwork. Through the fine openings of the porous surface,\r\nthe polyps of the colony are connected by interlacing tubes of animal\r\nsubstance (c[oe]nosarc). The polyps of the madrepore colonies are\r\nsmall in comparison with the connecting structure, which becomes very\r\nmassive; but, although large, the corallum is fragile, on account of\r\nits perforated character and the exceeding delicacy of its parts.\r\n\r\nIn species which form incrustations, new polyps arise from tissue\r\nwhich spreads beyond the corallites. In some species certain polyps\r\nand corallites increase in length, growing longitudinally, and\r\ncontinually form buds around the base. This manner of growth leads\r\nto the formation of branches, while the former manner gives lateral\r\nextension. Both of these forms of budding may take place at the same\r\ntime in the same colony. The madrepores are among the most common of\r\nthe reef-builders. They form reefs which extend for miles around the\r\nFlorida Keys.\r\n\r\n  ^M. cervicornis^, the stag-horn coral. This is a branching species\r\n  which attains large size. Its manner of growth is as follows: At\r\n  the tip of each branch is an individual polyp, which is larger\r\n  than those which surround the branch. This is the original animal\r\n  which started the branch, and is the parent from which all the\r\n  others on the branch have budded. The large terminal polyp buds\r\n  around the base; a surplus of lime also collects at the base and\r\n  clogs its tissues, so that it no longer can perform the functions\r\n  of life, and after a certain period the base becomes dead matter.\r\n  The polyp on the upper end continues to live and rises above the\r\n  excess of solid matter. At the same time it continues to form new\r\n  buds. The buds become independent corallites and secrete an excess\r\n  of calcareous matter at their bases, which cements them to the\r\n  parent stock and increases the thickness of the branch. Thus, as\r\n  the original polyp constantly rises and buds, the colony assumes a\r\n  stem-like form, covered with numerous individuals. Certain polyps\r\n  on the main stem have the attributes of the parent animal. These\r\n  start branches, and so the process goes on, and in time the colony\r\n  becomes much branched and arborescent in form. In the living coral\r\n  each little polyp is like a minute sea-anemone, having a colored\r\n  cylindrical body surrounded on its upper disk with numerous\r\n  tentacles. (Plate XLV.) [pg150]\r\n\r\n  ^M. palmata.^ This madrepore grows like the one described above,\r\n  except that the branches do not remain separated, but unite or grow\r\n  together, giving broad, flat surfaces which resemble fronds. When\r\n  carefully examined these surfaces show striations which indicate\r\n  the course of the branches. The structures forming the lobes are\r\n  caused by the failure of the branches to unite. On the Carysfort\r\n  Reef of the Florida Keys this species covers the top of the reef\r\n  for several miles, nearly reaching the surface, and appears like a\r\n  vast bed of low yellow shrubbery. (Plate XLV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Astrangia^\r\n\r\n  ^A. danaë.^ A small coral found on the New England coast. It lives\r\n  in the clefts of rocks in small patches, sometimes two to three\r\n  inches across and one quarter of an inch or more high. Frequently\r\n  it is like a thin crust of lime covered with star-like divisions.\r\n  Sometimes it forms branches. The living animals are white, and\r\n  when expanded rise above the cells and resemble a cluster of small\r\n  sea-anemones.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCLASS =ALCYONARIA= or =HALCYONOIDA=\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Alcyonium palmatum/: /A/, entire colony; /B/,\r\nspicules.]\r\n\r\nIn this subclass--the actinoid corals--the polyps are of two kinds.\r\nThe smaller are without tentacles and are called /siphonozoöids/. The\r\nlarger have but eight radial partitions and eight tentacles. This\r\nlimitation of parts places them in a higher rank than the corals of\r\nthe first subclass. Another characteristic of these polyps is the\r\npresence of symmetrical branchlets on the tentacles, which give them\r\na feather-like appearance. These corals are called halcyonoids.\r\n[pg151]\r\n\r\nSome of them may easily be fancied to have been selected for\r\nhalcyons' nests, as the name suggests--the sea-fans, for example.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =ALCYONACEA=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Alcyonium^\r\n\r\n  ^A. palmatum.^ This coral community is found sometimes at low-water\r\n  mark, but usually in deeper water, attached to shells and stones.\r\n  It is commonly known as dead-men's-fingers, an unpleasant name\r\n  given it by fishermen because of a fancied resemblance to a human\r\n  hand with only the stumps of the fingers. The substance of the\r\n  coral is semi-cartilaginous, with scattered spicules of lime which\r\n  give it stability. When the polyps are fully extended the colony\r\n  is rather attractive in appearance, but not so when contracted.\r\n  It is found in abundance on the New England coast. An immense\r\n  /Alcyonium/, /Paragorgia arborea/, grows on the fishing-banks off\r\n  Newfoundland, and is sometimes brought up on the fishing-lines. It\r\n  is tree-like in form, and measures six feet or more in length.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Tubipora^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Tubipora/, organ-pipe coral, natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe organ-pipe coral. This genus, which is deep red in color and very\r\nfragile, consists of many tubes slightly separated from [pg152] one\r\nanother, but connected by horizontal platforms at short intervals.\r\nThe form of reproduction, by budding, in this colony is peculiar to\r\nitself. The spicules of lime secreted in the polyp unite or fuse into\r\na tube or cylindrical skeleton. At certain stages of development\r\nthe polyp sends out a horizontal expansion, which unites with the\r\nexpansions of other polyps and becomes calcified, forming a shelf\r\nwhich binds the tubes together. From the top of the platforms other\r\ncorallites are formed, and thus a colony is made, which broadens as\r\nit rises in its growth. The body of the polyp is green, the skeleton\r\nred. It belongs to the East Indian seas and is given here only as an\r\nexample of a peculiar manner of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =GORGONACEA=\r\n\r\nSEA-FANS, SEA-WHIPS, AND SEA-FEATHERS\r\n\r\nThese are compound, tree-like /Alcyonaria/, with a calcareous or\r\nhorny skeleton which forms a branched axis and is covered with a\r\nlayer of united polyps having spicules of lime distributed through\r\nthe mass, which give some firmness to the bark-like covering.\r\nGorgonias, in great variety, grow in abundance on the coral reefs and\r\nmud-flats of Florida, forming masses of low shrubbery, pink, yellow,\r\nbrown, or purple in color.\r\n\r\nThe sea-whips and sea-feathers are varieties of gorgonias, which are\r\nnamed from their forms. Some have shapes which resemble branching\r\nshrubs; others are long unbranched rods, either straight or spiral.\r\nThey attain a height of several feet and are of various colors. The\r\ncolony has a horny axis surrounded by a living mass which resembles a\r\nsheet of animal matter. This mass consists of polyps closely united,\r\nand has throughout its substance spicules of carbonate of lime,\r\nmaking it a kind of calcareous crust or bark. In dried specimens\r\nthis becomes very brittle, and is easily broken from the horny axis.\r\n(Plates XLVI, XLVII.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLVI. GORGONIAS.\r\n\r\nEugorgia aurantica.

Leptogorgia\r\nAgassizii (a gorgonia). Pennatula borealis and P. aculeata\r\n(sea-pens).]\r\n\r\nThe sea-fans are colonies with a central, horny, flexible, and\r\nmuch-branched axis, covered, as in the sea-whips, with a layer of\r\nunited polyps containing spicules of lime, which make a somewhat\r\n[pg153] firm crust. This, in dried specimens, breaks off readily.\r\nThe colony branches profusely, or rather separates by fission, in\r\none plane, the large and small branches making a network of fan-like\r\nshape and often of great fineness and intricacy. These fans attain a\r\nlength of several feet and a corresponding breadth, and are abundant\r\nin semi-tropical as well as in more southern waters. In color they\r\nare red, yellow, brown, or purple.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =PENNATULACEA=\r\n\r\nSEA-PENS\r\n\r\nThese singular colonies resemble quill-feathers, such as are used for\r\npens, and are named for this reason. The long, horny central axis is\r\nnaked below, and is partly buried in the sand, but is not permanently\r\nattached. The upper portion of the axis has two rows of short,\r\nopposite, lateral branches; on the upper side of the branches the\r\npolyps live in separate inclosures. Spicules of lime are present in\r\nthe substance of the branches, which gives them stability. Sea-pens\r\nare found at moderate depths and are widely distributed. They are\r\nhighly colored and phosphorescent.

They are called \"comb-jellies\" from the rows of flat\r\ncilia, arranged like the teeth of a comb, which run in eight\r\nmeridional lines over the surface. It is by means of these cilia\r\nthat the animal moves through the water. The little paddles are\r\nworked in unison, in single lines, or each one of them can be\r\nmoved independently, and they give the animal varying and peculiar\r\nmotions. The /Ctenophora/ are nearly transparent, but have a\r\nprismatic coloring, caused by the waving cilia, and at night they are\r\nphosphorescent. They are widely distributed, being found in all seas.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the animal opens into a gullet which extends two thirds\r\nthrough the length of the body. On each side of the gullet is a\r\nvertical tube. The two tubes unite at the base of the gullet, and\r\nfrom there run as a single canal to the end opposite the mouth, and\r\nopen to the outside through two excretory pores. From the base of\r\nthe gullet, where the tubes unite, two other tubes extend laterally,\r\nwhich divide and subdivide in a horizontal plane, becoming eight in\r\nnumber, and connect at the surface with the lines of cilia; then,\r\ndividing, run in opposite directions to the poles of the spherical\r\nbody. The animal derives its nourishment and air through this\r\ncirculatory system. A nervous system is situated at the pole opposite\r\nthe mouth, in a small area surrounded by cilia, in the center is an\r\neye-speck, or lithocyst.

At one pole is the mouth, like\r\n  a slit, at the other a small area in the center of which is an\r\n  eye-spot. From the body hang two tentacles, half a yard or more\r\n  in length, fringed with cilia. The tentacles are very contractile\r\n  and can be rolled up or expanded with great rapidity; they take\r\n  graceful curves as the animal moves rapidly through the water.\r\n  /Pleurobrachia/ has a pink tint, and prismatic colors play over\r\n  it from the vibrating cilia. It is a beautiful and interesting\r\n  creature to watch.

Four of the\r\n  swimming-plates are shorter than the other four and terminate in\r\n  curious processes or short appendages called auricles. /Bolina/\r\n  is about two inches in length, and is very delicate, transparent,\r\n  and phosphorescent. Its contractile power enables it to vary in\r\n  outline to a considerable extent. It has a slow undulating motion,\r\n  and sometimes carries its lobes uppermost and open.

This singular animal, although not\r\n  an inhabitant of our seas, has its place in this group, and is\r\n  shown here because of its very curious shape. In form it is flat\r\n  and ribbon-like. Sometimes it attains a length of five feet, while\r\n  in breadth it is but one or two inches. The mouth is midway in its\r\n  length and is opposite the sense-organ or eye-spot. On each side of\r\n  the mouth is a short tentacle which protrudes from a sac. Four of\r\n  the swimming-plates are small; the other four extend along the edge\r\n  of the body. /Cestum/ moves by contractions of the body more than\r\n  by the combs which fringe its edges. It is very transparent, with\r\n  a violet hue, and is so delicate that it is difficult to capture\r\n  it uninjured. Its habitat is the Mediterranean Sea. It may be seen\r\n  among the zoölogical specimens in almost any museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Cestum veneris./]\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =BEROÏDA=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Idyia^\r\n\r\n  ^I. roseola.^ This species has an ovate body three to four inches\r\n  in height and about half as broad. Some individuals are larger.\r\n  It has [pg158] an eye-spot on the upper rounded side, and at\r\n  the other end a very large mouth opening into a digestive cavity,\r\n  which occupies the greater part of the body. A delicate fringe\r\n  surrounds the area about the eye-spot, and eight rows of cilia\r\n  run from there to the oral end. It has no tentacles. /Idyia/ is\r\n  pink and especially highly colored at the spawning-time. Like\r\n  other jellyfishes, their part in life is finished when they have\r\n  discharged their spawn, and the first September storms break them\r\n  to pieces. In July and August they are plentiful on the New England\r\n  coast. They appear at the surface of the water in the hottest part\r\n  of the day, but disappear entirely when the water is in the least\r\n  rough or the weather is cold or the sun overcast. Their movements\r\n  are slow and graceful, the long axis being carried in a nearly\r\n  horizontal position. They are exceedingly voracious, feeding\r\n  chiefly on other /Ctenophora/, and often swallowing animals as\r\n  large as themselves.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Idyia roseola/, half natural size: /d/, /e/, /f/,\r\n  /g/, /h/, rows of locomotive flappers.]\r\n\r\n  ^I. cyanthina.^ This species, found on the northern Pacific coast,\r\n  broadens near the center, making it somewhat vase-shaped. /Idyopsis\r\n  Clarkii/, a similar genus, found in Florida, is globular. All these\r\n  species are very beautiful, the rapid movement of the cilia giving\r\n  them a brilliant iridescence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n       WORMS\r\n  (PLATYHELMINTHES\r\n  NEMATHELMINTHES\r\n     ANNULATA)\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE WORMS DESCRIBED IN THIS\r\nCHAPTER\r\n\r\n  Phylum =PLATYHELMINTHES=\r\n\r\n    Class =TURBELLARIA=\r\n\r\n        Order ~POLYCLADIDA~\r\n\r\n          Genera              Species\r\n\r\n          ^Planocera^         ^P. nebulosa^\r\n          ^Stylochopsis^      ^S. littoralis^\r\n          ^Leptoplana^        ^L. folium^\r\n\r\n        Order ~TRICLADIDA~\r\n\r\n          ^Planaria^          ^P. grisea^\r\n          ^Procerodes^        ^P. frequens^\r\n          ^Bdelloura^         ^B. rustica^\r\n                              ^B. candida^\r\n          ^Fovia^             ^F.

The amateur collector, if he stops to give\r\nthem careful consideration, will probably find them unexpectedly\r\ninteresting, and will be surprised to find how many varieties of them\r\nthere are, and how different they are from his preconceived notion of\r\nthem. Worms are varied in structure, their habits are strange, and\r\ntheir form and color often beautiful. Although plentiful, they are\r\nnot conspicuous, but are easily found if search is made for them, and\r\nso large a class of shore animals should not be passed by unnoticed.\r\nUnusual biological interest is attached to this group because, in the\r\ndifferent types, affinities with other classes of animals are found,\r\nsuggesting, perhaps, connecting-links with higher organizations.\r\nThey are the first animals to show definite bilateral symmetry, or\r\ntwo similar sides, and to carry the same part of the body always in\r\nfront. Formerly one division, called /Vermes/, comprised all the\r\nworms. To-day they are separated into four divisions, or phyla. The\r\nmost careless observer easily recognizes the basis of separation, for\r\nthe flatworms, the round- or threadworms, the wheel-like animalcules,\r\nand the jointed worms have very obvious differences. The names given\r\nthe phyla express these distinctions, the termination [pg164]\r\nmeaning \"worm\"; the prefixes /Platy-/, /Nemat-/, /Troc-/, meaning\r\n\"flat,\" \"thread,\" \"wheel,\" respectively; while /Annulata/, meaning\r\n\"ringed,\" describes the segmented forms belonging to that phylum.\r\n\r\nThere are vast numbers of parasitic worms, which live internally or\r\nexternally on their hosts, there being no animal of land or sea, of\r\nhigh or low degree, which is not subject to the affliction of these\r\nvisitors. The parasitic worms are degenerate, some being without\r\ndigestive organs, or without eyes, or without locomotor organs, and\r\nso on, as the case may be, the host supplying the missing function.\r\nThe life-history of these low forms is interesting; but parasitic\r\nworms do not come within the scope of this book, and are mentioned\r\nonly to mark their place in the series.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYLUM =PLATYHELMINTHES=\r\n\r\nFLATWORMS\r\n\r\nThe flatworms have a flattened body, more or less compressed in the\r\ndifferent classes. Ordinarily the body is very thin, and, when short,\r\nhas a leaf-like form; when long it is ribbon-like. Some species are\r\nthick in the middle and thin at the edges. They have a dorsal, or\r\nupper, and a ventral, or under, surface; a right and a left side; an\r\nanterior and a posterior end. The anterior end is carried forward and\r\nhas some of the characteristics of a head, though a distinct head is\r\nnot apparent. The mouth is on the ventral surface. In some species it\r\nis in the middle of the length of the body; in others it is before or\r\nbehind this point.\r\n\r\nThe flatworms are the first animals to assume pronounced bilateral\r\nsymmetry. They are soft-bodied, having no supporting skeleton, and\r\nthey have no segments, or divisions, such as are found in higher\r\ntypes, as in /Annulata/. They have no body-cavity, the space\r\nbetween the organs and the body-wall being filled with tissue. The\r\nalimentary canal has no anal aperture, the excretions being carried\r\noff by a water-vascular system consisting of branching vessels which\r\nend in minute bundles of vibrating cilia, called ciliary flames.\r\nThese flames communicate with the exterior through small pores or\r\nflame-cells. Their sense-organs are eyes [pg165] and otocysts. The\r\nlatter are sacs containing crystals of carbonate of lime, and their\r\nfunction is supposed to be that of hearing.\r\n\r\nThe flatworms are hermaphroditic, and their propagation is by means\r\nof eggs. They are numerous and very generally distributed, occurring\r\nin fresh and salt water, on land and shore, on the surface and in\r\nthe depths of the sea. A vast number also are parasites and infest,\r\ninternally or externally, nearly every living creature. The parasitic\r\nforms differ anatomically from the free-living worms. The internal\r\nparasites, living by absorption of the digested food of their hosts,\r\nhave no digestive organs; they are also devoid of organs of sense\r\nand of defense. The external parasites, being carried about by their\r\nhosts, are without organs of locomotion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS =TURBELLARIA=\r\n\r\nThe turbellarians are the simplest group of bilateral animals and\r\noccupy the lowest place among worms. They owe their name to the fact\r\nthat they are covered with cilia, which are constantly in motion and\r\ncause a slight turbulence in the water around them.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =POLYCLADIDA=\r\n\r\n(\"/Many-branched/\")\r\n\r\nThe polyclads are found below half-tide mark on the under side of\r\nstones and on seaweeds. Sometimes they are found swimming about\r\nat night. They are leaf-like in form, one inch to two inches in\r\nlength, and are very thin and delicate. They adapt themselves to the\r\ninequalities of the surfaces to which they attach themselves, and\r\noften are of the same color, and therefore are so inconspicuous that\r\nthey are apt to escape notice. They move with a gliding motion over\r\nsurfaces, and often swim when in search of food.\r\n\r\nThe intestine is much branched and has no anal aperture. From the\r\nmouth, which is placed in the center of the ventral surface, a\r\npharynx, or muscular fold, is protruded in some species, which\r\nenables the worm to attach itself to and consume prey of considerable\r\nsize. After digestion has taken place, the fecal [pg166] matter\r\ncollects in the main intestine and is forcibly ejected by the\r\npharynx. Numerous eyes are collected in groups on the anterior dorsal\r\nsurface, or arranged around the margin of the body. The eggs are laid\r\nin shell-like cases, and cemented together in plate-like masses or in\r\nspirals, and attached to shells or stones. (Plate XLVIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Planocera^\r\n\r\n  ^P. nebulosa.^ One half of an inch wide and three quarters of an\r\n  inch long, circular or elliptical in shape; very flat and thin;\r\n  olive-green on the dorsal surface, with a line of darker color on\r\n  the posterior end, and whitish retractile tentacles on the back.\r\n  Found creeping on under side of stones in tide-pools.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Stylochopsis^\r\n\r\n  ^S. littoralis.^ About one half of an inch long; changeable in\r\n  form, from broad oval to elliptical; color pale green, veined with\r\n  a lighter shade on the dorsal side, flesh-colored on the ventral\r\n  surface; numerous eyes arranged in irregular rows near the margin\r\n  and in groups in front of the tentacles, also clusters of eyes on\r\n  the tentacles. Found under stones between tide-marks.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Leptoplana^\r\n\r\n  ^L. folium.^ Body flat; margin thin and undulated; shape leaf-like,\r\n  but changeable; about one inch long and one half of an inch wide;\r\n  color pale yellow, veined with a deeper shade; eyes in four groups\r\n  near the anterior end.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =TRICLADIDA=\r\n\r\n(\"/Three-branched/\")\r\n\r\nThe triclads are divided into three groups: those of the fresh-water\r\nponds and streams, those of the land and sea, known as planarians,\r\nand those of the sea. The planarians are the most interesting worms\r\nin the order. The triclads differ from the polyclads in being\r\nelongate in form and in having the intestine in three branches\r\ninstead of in many. The mouth is midway in the length of the body,\r\non the ventral side, and from it protrudes a pharynx, which is\r\ncylindrical or bell-shaped, and is capable of great dilatation. With\r\nthe pharynx the worm, which is wholly carnivorous, envelops other\r\nworms, crustaceans, or any animal food. Several species are found on\r\nthe under side of stones in tide-pools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XLVIII. Polyclad worm. Worm-tubes of Diopatra.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Planaria^\r\n\r\n  ^P. grisea.^ Oval or elliptical in form; anterior end truncate;\r\n  posterior end rounded; color yellow or gray, with a light stripe;\r\n  two black eyes surrounded with white; length one half to three\r\n  quarters of an inch; width about one eighth of an inch. Found under\r\n  stones between tide-marks.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Procerodes^\r\n\r\n  ^P. frequens.^ One eighth of an inch long; brown or black above,\r\n  gray below; has two kidney-shaped eyes; active and abundant.

Found on /Ulva\r\n  latissima/ (sea-lettuce).\r\n\r\n  ^B. candida.^ Parasitic on the gills of the horseshoe-crab.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Fovia^\r\n\r\n  ^F. Warrenii.^ Bright red, narrow, oblong. Found on eel-grass.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =RHABDOC[OE]LIDA=\r\n\r\nMinute, active worms found among the red seaweeds. They are brown in\r\ncolor, and are marked by one or more transverse white bars.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS =NEMERTINEA=\r\n\r\nThe nemerteans are long, narrow, flat, smooth worms, and vary from\r\none half of an inch to many feet in length. They are exceedingly\r\ncontractile, and when alarmed can shrink to less than half their\r\nnormal length. They are very generally distributed, and are to be\r\nfound between tide-marks, in loose coils like a string, under stones\r\non sandy and muddy shores. The very long species, like /Lineus\r\nmarinus/, are solitary, but other smaller species are gregarious,\r\nmany worms being coiled together in tangled masses. Some species are\r\nto be found in empty shells, and others live among the seaweeds. They\r\nare very slimy, the epidermis secreting an abundance of mucus, and\r\nthey can often be tracked by the trail of slime they leave behind\r\nthem. This mucus sometimes hardens, forming for some species a\r\ntubular [pg168] covering; others remain naked. All are covered with\r\nvibrating cilia, which is a universal feature of flatworms. In color\r\nthey may be white, yellow, green, red, purple, etc., and sometimes\r\nthey are banded or striped with a contrasting color. The ventral is\r\nusually lighter than the dorsal surface.\r\n\r\nThe principal characteristic of the nemertean worms is a long\r\nthread-like organ, known as the /proboscis/. This lies in a sheath\r\nalong the center of the dorsal surface, and is quickly thrown out\r\nto a great length, and as quickly completely withdrawn within the\r\nbody. The proboscis is slender, hollow, muscular, and full of nerves.\r\nIt reaches the outside through a pore at the anterior end of the\r\nbody, and has no connection with the alimentary system. It is used\r\nas a feeler and as a weapon. Some species have a sharp spine at the\r\nend of the proboscis, others have stinging-cells. The proboscis is\r\nsometimes so forcibly ejected that it breaks off, in which case it\r\nretains its vitality for some time, and seems as if it were itself a\r\nworm. A new proboscis is quickly grown by the worm to take the place\r\nof a lost one. The head is a little broader than the body, and has\r\neyes arranged in one or several pairs on each side. The mouth is on\r\nthe ventral surface, near the anterior end, has thick lips, and is\r\nvery dilatable. Through the mouth the animal ejects a part of the\r\nesophagus and envelops its prey, which is often of considerable size.\r\nChætopod worms they often swallow whole; the soft parts, after being\r\ndigested, are carried off through the regular passages, ending in the\r\nciliary flames (page 164), while the indigestible parts are ejected\r\nat the anus. Often the spines and bristles find their way out by\r\nperforating the intestine and the body-wall, without apparently doing\r\nthe worm any injury. The perforated parts quickly heal.\r\n\r\nThese worms have the strange power of regenerating lost parts;\r\nmutilated portions are soon repaired. The anterior end, when severed\r\nfrom the rest of the body, grows again into a complete individual,\r\nwhile the posterior end continues to perform part of its functions\r\nand retains its vitality for a considerable time before dying. One\r\nspecies, /Lineus sanguineus/, is capable, after being broken in\r\npieces, of regenerating each section into a perfect worm. [pg169]\r\n\r\nThe nemerteans are carnivorous, voracious, and often cannibalistic.\r\nThey will live for some time in confinement, losing, however, their\r\nbright color, and the smaller worms will gradually disappear, as they\r\nare devoured by the larger ones. The mode of locomotion varies with\r\nthe order. Some species attach their long proboscis to a distant\r\nobject, then drag the body to it; some glide rapidly along by means\r\nof the muscles of the body and the cilia which cover it; others swim.\r\nThe swimming forms have thin edges which have a wave-like motion,\r\nand this, together with a lateral movement of the tail, propels them\r\nthrough the water. In some species the worm develops directly from\r\nthe egg; others pass through a larval stage before reaching maturity.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Tetrastemma^\r\n\r\n  ^T. arenicola.^ Dark flesh-color or purplish; slender, cylindrical,\r\n  four to five inches long when extended; head changeable in form and\r\n  partly distinct from body because of slight constriction at the\r\n  neck. It lives in sand at low-water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Nemertes^\r\n\r\n  ^N. socialis.^ Individuals very slender, five to six inches long\r\n  when extended; color brown or black, a little lighter underneath;\r\n  three or four eyes in lines on each side the head. It is abundant\r\n  under stones on rocky shores, many coiled together, forming large\r\n  masses.\r\n\r\n  ^N. viridis.^ Color olive-green or brown, crossed by faint pale\r\n  lines; body changeable in form; when extended, six to eight inches\r\n  long, one eighth of an inch or less in breadth; row of dark eyes on\r\n  each side of flat head. Common under stones between tide-marks on\r\n  northern rocky shores.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Meckelia^\r\n\r\n  ^M. ingens.^ One of the largest nemertean worms; found on sandy and\r\n  muddy shores near low-water mark. The young, from several inches to\r\n  a foot long, are common. When full-grown some attain the length of\r\n  twelve or thirteen feet, and are an inch in breadth and quite flat\r\n  when extended, but can contract to two or three feet in length,\r\n  and are then nearly cylindrical. This worm, although so soft,\r\n  penetrates the sand with great rapidity. Its head changes shape\r\n  constantly and assists the proboscis when burrowing. It is also\r\n  able to swim. Its color is yellowish or flesh-color, with whitish\r\n  edges and a central band.\r\n\r\n  ^M. rosea.^ The largest specimens are six to eight inches long and\r\n  one quarter of an inch broad; lives in burrows on sandy beaches;\r\n  color red or pink; often covered with sand, which adheres to the\r\n  mucus which the worm secretes. [pg170]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cerebratulus^\r\n\r\n  ^C. angulatus.^ Olive-green, with light dorsal stripe.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cosmocephala^\r\n\r\n  ^C. ochracea.^ Two to three inches long when extended; gray or\r\n  yellowish-white, and mottled by the internal organs showing through\r\n  the translucent body; line of lighter color down the back; anterior\r\n  end often orange-colored. It is common near low-water mark under\r\n  stones and in the dead tubes of /Serpula/.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Polina^\r\n\r\n  ^P. glutinosa.^ One to two inches long; color orange or light\r\n  yellow, with a faint line of deeper color down the center of the\r\n  dorsal surface; very slimy; eyes numerous, in oblique lines on the\r\n  head. Found in tide-pools on algæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYLUM =NEMATHELMINTHES=\r\n\r\n\r\nROUNDWORMS\r\n\r\nThe worms of this phylum have the general name of roundworms, which\r\ndistinguishes them from the flatworms of the preceding division and\r\nfrom the segmented worms of the /Annulata/. The body is elongated,\r\ncylindrical, smooth, and pointed at both ends. With few exceptions,\r\nthey are parasitic.\r\n\r\nA few of the nematode species are free, living under stones and among\r\nseaweeds at about low-water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS =NEMATODA=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pontonema^\r\n\r\n  ^P. marinum.^ Slender, white, smooth, active, cylindrical;\r\n  constantly coiling and uncoiling itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYLUM =ANNULATA=\r\n\r\n\r\nSEGMENTED WORMS\r\n\r\nThe name of this phylum expresses the principal characteristic of\r\nthe group of worms which have elongated bodies composed of series\r\nof short parts, or ring-like divisions. Each one of these segments\r\ncontains a separate and similar set of internal organs. [pg171]\r\n\r\nThe annelids are divided into four classes, one of which, the\r\n/Gephyrea/, has not the characteristics which distinguish the group.\r\nThe classes are easily recognized by conspicuous features. Some have\r\nbristles; others have scales; others have tentacles around the head\r\nand inclose themselves in tubes. Many are highly colored, and all\r\nare of great interest to the naturalist from the diversity of their\r\nhabits, form, and structure, and from the analogies they bear to\r\nother and higher types of animals.\r\n\r\nThe annelids are the highest type of worms, their organs having\r\nattained more special functions. The sense-organs of eye and ear\r\nare more developed, and the nervous system has distinct centers,\r\nor ganglia, the first and largest ganglion being a part of the\r\nhead. They are found in abundance everywhere. Some species grow to\r\nthe length of one foot or two feet. Some are carnivorous, others\r\nvegetarian, and many are mud-eaters, swallowing sand and mud for the\r\nsake of the organisms they contain. They themselves are food for\r\nfishes, which devour them in vast quantities, rooting them out of\r\ntheir burrows or capturing them at night, at which time they swim\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS =CHÆTOPODA=\r\n\r\n(\"/Bristle-footed/\")\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A magnified parapodium of /Nereis dumerilii/: /dors.\r\ncirr./, dorsal cirrus; /vent. cirr./, ventral cirrus; /s/, setæ.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bristle-worms. This class of worms has bunches of bristles on\r\nboth sides of each segment of the body, which serve as organs of\r\nlocomotion, or bristle-feet. The bristles emanate from outgrowths\r\nof the body known as /parapodia/, which are practically limbs. The\r\nparapodia are sometimes divided into distinct lobes or branches. The\r\nbristles are of various shapes and often of brilliant color. They\r\nare usually horny, sometimes simple, sometimes divided into joints,\r\nand vary in shape in different genera. The parapodia have, besides\r\nthe bristles, a second set of [pg172] hair-like appendages, called\r\n/cirri/. These are sense-organs and also have a respiratory function.\r\nThe cirri too vary in shape in different genera. Generally they are\r\nhair-like, but sometimes conical; again they are broadened into\r\nscales, as in the /Aphroditidæ/.\r\n\r\nThe body-cavity in chætopod worms is divided into a series of\r\nchambers or segments. These divisions seem on the exterior like\r\nconstrictions, and give the body the appearance of a series of rings.\r\nThe internal organs are repeated in each segment, so that each of\r\nthe latter contains a portion of the alimentary canal, a pair of\r\n/nephridia/, a pair of nerve-ganglia, and blood-vessels which connect\r\nthe main blood-vessels running along the dorsal and ventral surfaces.\r\nThe alimentary canal runs through the body, but is constricted at\r\neach joint. The nephridia are curved tubes, which are excretory\r\norgans, opening to the outside and carrying off the waste products\r\nwhich have passed into the fluid of the body-cavity.\r\n\r\nThe chætopod worms have a well-developed nervous system, beginning\r\nwith a two-lobed ganglion forming a brain and head, then extending\r\nthrough the worm in a double ventral chain and series of ganglia.\r\nThey have also a blood-vascular system. The blood is either colored\r\nor colorless. Sometimes it is a bright red or green, and is often\r\nvisible through the body-wall. The circulation is effected, not\r\nby means of a heart, but by wave-like (peristaltic) contractions\r\nof the dorsal blood-vessel. The body is cylindrical, but in many\r\ncases is somewhat flattened. There are two layers of muscles, one\r\nof which encircles the body, while the other extends parallel with\r\nits length. Respiration is effected by /gills/, which may be simple,\r\nhair-like appendages to the parapodia, or branched, or comb-like\r\nin form. Sometimes they are confined to the middle segments, as\r\nin /Arenicola/; sometimes to the segments near the head, as in\r\n/Tubicola/; or they may be extended over the whole dorsal surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCLASS =POLYCHÆTA=\r\n\r\n(\"/Many-bristled/\")\r\n\r\nThe polychæte worms have one or two well-developed parapodia, or\r\nlimbs, on each side of every segment of the body, and on each\r\n[pg173] parapodium is a bunch of bristles, or /chætæ/. There are\r\nhundreds of species of this class of worms, the species being based\r\non the shape and the lobes of the parapodia, the relative length of\r\nthe cirri, the form and arrangement of the chætæ, and so on. They\r\nare abundant on the shore everywhere, but abound where rocks and\r\nstones afford them some shelter. Many burrow in the sand and mud.\r\nIn doing this the worm eats his way into the hole, swallowing the\r\nmud and sand. He assimilates the organic or vegetable matter the\r\nmud contains, and ejects the rest in cylindrical coils, known as\r\ncastings, which lie in heaps at the mouth of the burrow. By these\r\ncastings they may be traced. Others secrete tubes.\r\n\r\nThe polychæte worms are divided into /Errantia/, which are wandering,\r\nfree-swimming forms, and /Sedentaria/ or /Tubicola/, which live in\r\ntubes permanently. These distinctions are not strictly correct, since\r\nsome species of errant polychætes form tubes (/Eunicidæ/), and some\r\n/Sedentaria/ form no tubes.\r\n\r\nMany polychætes are beautifully colored, some in vivid reds and\r\ngreens, with various markings; some are iridescent; some are\r\nphosphorescent.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =ERRANTIA=\r\n\r\nCarnivorous, free /Polychæta/, with protrusible pharynx armed with a\r\nhorny jaw. \"They are active, fierce beasts of prey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~SYLLIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThis family is the highest in organization of the worms. They are\r\nsmall, the majority being less than an inch in length, and many are\r\nminute. They are often highly colored. Many have long cirri on the\r\nfeet; some have alternation of generation. They are common everywhere\r\nalong the coast, but are not seen unless searched for. Sponges\r\nsometimes are alive with them. They are interesting subjects for\r\nmicroscopic study.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~APHRODITIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThe scale-bearing annelids. This family of worms is distinguished\r\nfrom all others by having scales on the back. The scales, called\r\n/elytra/, are flattened dorsal cirri carried on the upper parapodia,\r\n[pg174] and generally on alternate segments and in a double row down\r\nthe back. The elytra are the breathing-organs, and, although of a\r\nhorny texture, are richly supplied with nerves. The worms are short\r\nand have a large protrusible pharynx armed with a double pair of\r\nhorny jaws.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Polynoë^\r\n\r\nThe species of /Polynoë/ are determined by the number of scales they\r\nbear. They have a flattened short body with nearly parallel sides.\r\nThe bristles are of a bright golden color. The proboscis is large and\r\nhas four powerful jaws at the end and a circle of papillæ at the top.\r\nThey are sluggish in movement and are found under stones and in the\r\ncrevices of rocks. When disturbed they roll themselves into a ball.\r\n\r\n  ^P. squamata.^ Twelve pairs of rough scales; color sandy-brown,\r\n  speckled; one inch to one and a half inches long; the broad, oval\r\n  scales overlap and entirely cover the body and head. Some /Polynoë/\r\n  when disturbed throw off every scale. Very common north of Cape Cod.\r\n\r\n  ^P. sublevis.^ Twelve pairs of smooth scales; usually grayish-brown\r\n  in color, speckled with dark spots; iridescent; last pair of scales\r\n  more slender than the others; length one and a quarter inches,\r\n  breadth about one quarter of an inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Polynoë squamata./]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Harmothoë^\r\n\r\n  ^H. imbricata.^ Sixteen pairs of smooth scales; variable in color;\r\n  usually gray, speckled, or striped.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Aphrodite^\r\n\r\n  ^A. aculeata.^ This polychæte, sometimes called the sea-mouse, is\r\n  one of the most beautiful of worms. It is brightly iridescent in\r\n  color, from its setæ, which form a fur-like coating over the dorsal\r\n  surface. It has fifteen pairs of scales, but they are hidden by\r\n  the numerous setæ. These bristles cover its sides and back. Some\r\n  are coarse and nearly an inch long, with sharp points, and are\r\n  barbed near the ends. They curve over the back like the quills of a\r\n  porcupine. The body is three to six inches long. It is broadest in\r\n  the middle and tapers to a point. They live in mud below tide-mark,\r\n  and may be found washed upon the beach after storms. [pg175]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~PHYLLODOCIDÆ~\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Aphrodite aculeata/, natural size: /c/, neuropodial\r\nchætæ; /p/, palps; 1, iridescent bristles; 2, stiff chætæ; 3, felting\r\nbristles of notopodium.]\r\n\r\nThese animals are commonly known as \"paddle-worms,\" on account of\r\nhaving leaf-like cirri, which they use in locomotion. The head is\r\nlong and bears four pairs of short and four pairs of long tentacles.\r\nThe body is long and depressed, sometimes two feet in length, usually\r\neight to twelve inches long. The general color is bright green and\r\niridescent. Found in tide-pools. Specimens are often found by digging\r\nin sandy mud, or they may be obtained by placing old shells and other\r\nmaterial in a dish of sea-water. When the water becomes a little\r\nstale, the worms of this and other families make their way to the\r\nsides of the dish, where they secrete a colorless slime which holds\r\nmud or any light matter that it may come in contact with. In this\r\ncondition, when lifted or disturbed, they crawl rapidly out of the\r\nslime, and show to good advantage their elongate body, which is often\r\nbeautifully colored.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Phyllodoce^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Phyllodoce paretii./]\r\n\r\n  ^P. gracilis.^ Three inches or more long and one sixteenth of\r\n  an inch wide; large proboscis, with twelve longitudinal rows of\r\n  prominent [pg176] projections on the swollen base, its terminal\r\n  end smooth, with a circle of round projections at the orifice;\r\n  color green, with a row of dark spots down the center of the dorsal\r\n  surface and a fainter line of spots on each side at the base of the\r\n  parapodia. Found on the New England coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~NEREIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Nereis^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Head of /Nereis pelagica/.]\r\n\r\nAmong the most common of the polychæte worms is the genus ^Nereis^,\r\nvarious species of which are found in all parts of the world. They\r\nare abundant under stones, among seaweeds, and living in burrows\r\nbetween tide-marks. They are active, fierce, and voracious. Some\r\nattain a length of eighteen or more inches. They are commonly known\r\nas \"clam-worms,\" and are used by fishermen for bait. /Nereis/ has a\r\ndistinct head, consisting of two parts. One, the /prostomium/, bears\r\non its upper side four eyes and a pair of short, conical tentacles,\r\nand on the lateral sides a second pair of processes called /palps/.\r\nThe palps are more conspicuous than the tentacles, and consist of two\r\nparts, a large base and a small terminal point, the latter capable\r\nof being withdrawn. The palps are sense-organs and perhaps test the\r\nfood. The second part of the head, or /peristomium/, bears on the\r\nsides four pairs of long tentacles which are used as feelers. The\r\nmouth is on the ventral side, and through it /Nereis/ throws out\r\nits pharynx, which contains a horny, notched jaw. It seizes its\r\nprey with this jaw, which, with the pharynx, is then withdrawn and\r\ntears the food apart, acting like a gizzard. The body of /Nereis/\r\nis rounded above and nearly flat below. Each of the segments has a\r\npair of parapodia, bearing a bundle of bristles and cirri. The last\r\nsegment of the body is elongated, cylindrical, and without parapodia,\r\nbut has on the end a pair of long cirri, which give the appearance\r\nof a divided tail. Each segment of the body, except the head- and\r\ntail-segments, contains a pair of excretory tubes (/nephridia/),\r\nganglia of nerves, and a portion of the intestine and of the vascular\r\nsystem. There are circular muscles by which the worm can diminish its\r\ndiameter, longitudinal [pg177] muscles in four bands, and muscles to\r\nmove the parapodia. Breathing is carried on over the whole surface\r\nof the body, and especially in parts of the lobes of the parapodia\r\ncalled gills. Its sense-organs are eyes, palps, tentacles, and cirri.\r\n\r\n  ^N. virens.^ This species is found from New York northward in\r\n  muddy and shelly sand, and under rocks between tide-marks, living\r\n  in burrows, which it lines with a mucous secretion. It is very\r\n  active, and voracious, feeding on other worms, /Crustacea/, etc.,\r\n  which it captures with its horny, protruded jaw. At night it\r\n  leaves its burrow and swims freely about like an eel, frequently\r\n  falling a prey to fishes. In color it is dull bluish-green, with\r\n  some iridescence. The gills, which are leaf-like appendages on the\r\n  parapodia, are green on the anterior end of the body and become\r\n  bright red farther back. This species, and /N. branti/ of Alaska,\r\n  are the giants of polychæte worms, often measuring eighteen inches\r\n  or more in length.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Nereis pelagica./ 1, male; 2, female.]\r\n\r\n  ^N. pelagica.^ Found in abundance on the New England shore and\r\n  northern coasts under stones and on shelly bottoms. The female is\r\n  four to five inches long, while the male is only two inches in\r\n  length. In this species the body is widest in the middle, while in\r\n  other species it is widest at the anterior end. The palps are long,\r\n  and the second head-piece (peristomium) is twice as long as the\r\n  next segment. The color is reddish-brown and iridescent.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Nereis limbata./ Male, anterior part of body, head\r\n  and extended proboscis.]\r\n\r\n  ^N. limbata.^ Five to six inches long; jaws light yellow, sharp,\r\n  and slender; parapodia and bristles smaller on the anterior than on\r\n  the posterior end; color dark brown, with light lines on the sides\r\n  and appendages, pale red on the posterior end; dorsal blood-vessel\r\n  apparent, and the heart-like pulsations can be distinctly seen.\r\n  The male worm is red in the middle section. Found along the middle\r\n  Atlantic coast on sandy shores.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~NEPHTHYDIDÆ~\r\n\r\nIn this family the worms have a long, thick, flattish body, a section\r\nof which has a quadrangular form. The lobes of the parapodia are\r\nwidely separated and fringed [pg178] with membrane, appearing like\r\ndouble parapodia. The pharynx is very large and projected as in\r\n/Nereis/.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Nephthys^\r\n\r\n  ^N. ingens.^ Sometimes six inches long and one quarter of an inch\r\n  broad; usually smaller; color whitish, with red blood-vessel\r\n  showing on dorsal side; appendages dark blown; moves actively\r\n  and burrows quickly into the mud; when captured often breaks off\r\n  a portion of the posterior end, which it is able to reproduce;\r\n  proboscis large; branchiæ between the dorsal and ventral parapodia.\r\n  Found burrowing in all kinds of mud on the New England coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Nephthys ingens./ Anterior part of body and extended\r\nproboscis; ventral view. Enlarged.]\r\n\r\n  ^N. picta.^ More slender than /N. ingens/; color whitish, mottled\r\n  with brown on the dorsal anterior end; often a dark line down the\r\n  back; head square in front and triangular in the back. Found in\r\n  sandy mud at low-water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~EUNICIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThese are beautiful worms, having a reddish-brown iridescent body,\r\nwith bright-red branching gills, which look like feathers, along the\r\nback. They form parchment-like tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Marphysa^\r\n\r\n  ^M. sanguinea.^ Length six inches or more; color bronze or\r\n  brownish-red and iridescent; has bright-red branched gills and six\r\n  caudal cirri of different lengths; body flattened, except at the\r\n  anterior end, where it becomes narrow and cylindrical; has powerful\r\n  jaws. It is found under stones and in clefts of rocks at low-water\r\n  mark, or more commonly in parchment-like tubes on shelly beaches,\r\n  from Cape Cod to New Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Diopatra^\r\n\r\n  ^D. cuprea.^ This is one of the largest and most beautiful\r\n  annelids. It is found from Cape Cod to South Carolina at low-water\r\n  mark, in sandy mud-flats, living in long tubes which project above\r\n  the surface two or three inches and are hung with seaweeds and bits\r\n  of foreign matter. /Diopatra/ is twelve inches or more in length\r\n  and one half of an inch in breadth. In color it is reddish-brown,\r\n  specked with gray, and has a brilliant whitish or opal-like\r\n  iridescence. The appendages are yellowish-brown, specked with\r\n  green. The body is flattened. From the fifth segment long, dull\r\n  to bright red, much-branched gills, resembling plumes, [pg179]\r\n  extend nearly to the end of the worm. On the ventral side of the\r\n  parapodia are whitish tubercles with a dark spot in the middle.\r\n  These papillæ secrete the long, broad tube in which the worm lives.\r\n  The worm is difficult to capture, for when pursued it retreats\r\n  quickly into its tube, which is so large that it can easily turn\r\n  around within it. (Plate XLVIII.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Diopatra cuprea./ Head and anterior part of body,\r\nshowing part of the branchiæ; side view.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Arabella^\r\n\r\n  ^A. opalina.^ Body cylindrical, twelve to eighteen inches long,\r\n  one quarter of an inch wide in the middle, and tapers to the ends,\r\n  which are comparatively small; lateral appendages short; color\r\n  bronze, with brilliant, opal-like iridescence; head small, conical,\r\n  but blunt and without tentacles; four eyes in transverse row at the\r\n  base of the head; segments well marked; coils into spirals when\r\n  outside of its burrow. Found in compact sandy mud at low-water mark\r\n  on the New England coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Lumbriconereis^\r\n\r\n  ^L. tenuis.^ Twelve inches or more long, and slender, like a fine\r\n  cord; bright red and somewhat iridescent; very fragile. Abundant\r\n  in sandy mud on the northern New England coast, and found from New\r\n  Jersey northward.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~GLYCERIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThese worms are long and smooth, with numerous segments. They taper\r\nat both ends. The head is small, conical, sharply pointed, and has\r\nfour very small tentacles. The proboscis, or [pg180] pharynx, when\r\nprotruded, is very large and long, and appears too large for the\r\nworm. The proboscis has four hook-like jaws. These worms burrow\r\nrapidly and disappear almost instantly into the mud or sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Glycera meckelii/, with pharynx everted.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Glycera^\r\n\r\n  ^G. americana.^ Color red or purple; has branched gills on upper\r\n  side of parapodia. Found from South Carolina to Cape Cod on sandy\r\n  and muddy shores and flats near low-water mark.\r\n\r\n  ^G. dibranchiata.^ Has a simple gill on both sides of the\r\n  parapodia; about eight inches long and one quarter of an inch wide\r\n  in the middle; proboscis one inch long and wider than the body on\r\n  the upper end. Abundant from New Jersey to Cape Cod.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =SEDENTARIA=\r\n\r\nTHE TUBICOLOUS WORMS\r\n\r\nMany of this order construct tubes in which they live permanently.\r\nSome species of both /Sedentaria/ and /Errantia/ have habits\r\npertaining to the other. These worms are without a protrusible\r\npharynx and without jaws. The body is usually divided into two or\r\nthree sections by segments and appendages of different forms. They\r\nhave hair-setæ on a limited number of segments only, varying with the\r\nspecies; the remaining segments have /uncini/, or hooked comb-like\r\nrows of setæ, which are very small, but often crowded in bunches.\r\nUncini exist also on segments having hair-setæ. Parapodia are often\r\nlacking on the posterior parts and are usually without cirri. The\r\ngills are usually confined to the anterior end and are sometimes\r\nrepresented by tentacles around the head. The different species have\r\ncharacteristic tubes, formed by mucus secreted by epidermal glands.\r\nSometimes the mucus hardens, making a parchment-like tube; again it\r\ncements together grains of sand, or bits of shell, seaweeds, etc.\r\nSome species secrete [pg181] calcareous tubes; these are often found\r\non rocks, in coral, and in the shells of mollusks. The anterior end\r\nof the body is more highly developed than the posterior end.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~SPIONIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Nerine^\r\n\r\n  ^N. agilis.^ Two to three inches long; slender; somewhat flattened\r\n  at the anterior end; head conical and sharp; the two tentacles\r\n  about one half of an inch long; four eyes; color reddish-brown,\r\n  light green on the sides; gills red; tentacles greenish-white. It\r\n  burrows with extreme rapidity and lives on exposed beaches near\r\n  low-water mark.\r\n\r\n  ^N. coniocephala.^ Two and a half inches long, one sixteenth of an\r\n  inch in diameter; head conical; body flattened on the dorsal side,\r\n  round on the ventral side; has two long tentacles turned backward\r\n  and a membrane on the gills of the anterior segments; gills red;\r\n  bristles long and numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CIRRATULIDÆ~\r\n\r\nWorms of this family have a cylindrical body, more or less attenuated\r\nat each end; segments similar throughout; many segments with long,\r\nfilamentous cirri which act as gills; and a conical head. They live\r\nin burrows.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cirratulus^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Cirratulus grandis./]\r\n\r\n  ^C. grandis.^ Four to six inches long; head acute; segments\r\n  numerous, short, and distinct; color dull yellow, or orange,\r\n  to brown, often iridescent beneath; ventral surface somewhat\r\n  flattened. Numerous long, filamentous, red to orange-colored cirri\r\n  extend nearly the whole length of the body and act as gills. It is\r\n  common in sand and gravel at low-water mark from Cape Cod to New\r\n  Jersey. [pg182]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~TEREBELLIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThe body is cylindrical and largest on the anterior end; there are\r\none to three pairs of more or less branched gills on the anterior\r\nend, and the ventral surface of the anterior segments is thickened by\r\nglands which secrete mucus for tube-building. These gland-spaces are\r\ncalled /shields/.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Thelepsus^\r\n\r\n  ^T. cincinnatus.^ Two to four inches long; pale red; marked like\r\n  lacework on the back; gills have numerous unbranched filaments\r\n  arising separately in two transverse rows; tubes thin, transparent,\r\n  flexible, and hung with foreign substances; attached along the\r\n  whole length.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Amphitrite^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Amphitrite ornata./]\r\n\r\n  ^A. ornata.^ Twelve to fifteen inches long; flesh-color, reddish,\r\n  or brown; three pairs of red plume-like gills and numerous\r\n  flesh-colored tentacles around the anterior end; tentacles\r\n  constantly in motion and sometimes extended eight or ten inches;\r\n  tubes a quarter of an inch or more in diameter, and firm, being\r\n  composed of sand and mud. It is found under stones in mud, gravel,\r\n  and sand at low-water mark from Cape Cod to New Jersey, often\r\n  associated with /Cirratulus grandis/.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GENERA ^Polycirrus^, ^Chætobranchus^\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Polycirrus eximius./]\r\n\r\n  ^P. eximius^, ^C. sanguineus^. These are two species of bright-red,\r\n  fragile worms, found under stones, in mud. They do not form\r\n  tubes. The first is a small worm, the second twelve to fifteen\r\n  inches long. Both have long, crowded tentacles extending in\r\n  every direction and distended as the blood flows into them. /C.\r\n  sanguineus/ has [pg183] tentacles sixteen inches in extent, and\r\n  branched gills on short pedicels on the back. They are common in\r\n  mud at low-water mark from Cape Cod to New Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~AMPHICTENIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cistenides^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Cistenides Gouldii./ ]\r\n\r\n  ^C. Gouldii^ constructs conical free tubes of grains of sand in\r\n  a single layer; body short and a little curved; head obliquely\r\n  flattened; two broad groups of golden bristles turned upward on\r\n  each side of the anterior end; one to two inches long; color\r\n  light red or flesh-color, mottled with red or blue. This is a\r\n  common worm, and its horn-shaped tubes are so plentiful as to\r\n  attract attention on sandy shores. They will repay examination\r\n  with a glass, so beautifully are they built. The worm has\r\n  bunches of golden bristles arranged in two rows close to the\r\n  flattened anterior end, which make a kind of operculum to the\r\n  tube. This feature makes the species easy to identify. The worm\r\n  is transparent; the internal organs showing through give it the\r\n  various bright colors. It is found on sandy and muddy shores from\r\n  New Jersey northward.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~MALDANIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThe tubes of these animals are formed of sand, a short portion\r\nprojecting, and are very abundant in certain places. There is a horny\r\nplate on the upper surface of the head, and the skin on the sides of\r\nthe head is raised in folds. There is a funnel-like process at the\r\nposterior extremity; gills are lacking. Some of the segments in the\r\nmiddle of the body are longer than the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Clymenella^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Clymenella torquata./ /a/, head and extended\r\nproboscis, front view; /b/, posterior end; /c/, entire animal, side\r\nview, natural size.]\r\n\r\n  ^C. torquata.^ Body long, composed of twenty-two segments; the\r\n  fifth segment has a collar-like fold; the caudal extremity is\r\n  funnel-shaped and edged with papillæ; both [pg184] the first and\r\n  the last three segments are bare, the rest have short bristles\r\n  above and hooks below; head has a prominent convex plate with a\r\n  raised border; worm pale red, with bright-red bands around the\r\n  segments, sometimes brownish. It constructs nearly straight tubes\r\n  of pure sand close to low-water mark in sheltered coves, and ranges\r\n  from New Jersey northward.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Maldane^\r\n\r\n  ^M. elongata.^ Six to eight inches long, one eighth to one quarter\r\n  of an inch in diameter; body cylindrical, cut obliquely at both\r\n  ends; head bordered by a slight fold; color brown, with red blood\r\n  showing through. Found in sandy mud at low-water mark, in firm,\r\n  deep tubes of fine mud, on the New England coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~ARENICOLIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Arenicola^\r\n\r\n  ^A. marina.^ Five to ten inches long; brownish-green; body\r\n  cylindrical, thickest on the anterior end; anterior and posterior\r\n  ends without chætæ; twelve to thirteen pairs of branched red gills\r\n  on the central segments. It makes burrows eighteen to twenty-four\r\n  inches deep on sandy southern shores, and can be traced by castings\r\n  at the mouth of the burrow. Commonly known as \"lugworm,\" and used\r\n  by fishermen for bait.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~SABELLIDÆ~\r\n\r\nIn this family the gills arise from two semicircular bases forming\r\nthe crown; the second lobe of the anterior extremity is reversed like\r\na collar; the gill-filaments have secondary processes, and the tubes\r\nare flexible, composed of cemented mud or sand. Found under stones,\r\nthe tube passing around the stone and opening upward.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Sabella^\r\n\r\n  ^S. microphthalma.^ Length of tube one and a quarter inches,\r\n  diameter one eighth of an inch; body olive-green, specked with\r\n  white; wreath of tentacles half as long as the body; tentacles pale\r\n  yellowish or flesh-colored, with transverse lines of darker color.\r\n  It is found on the southern New England coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~SERPULIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThis family forms white calcareous tubes. One of the dorsal\r\ngill-filaments is flattened, forming an operculum, or cover, with\r\n[pg185] which the tube is closed when the worm has withdrawn itself\r\ninside. The tubes are commonly found attached to shells and rocks,\r\nusually solitary, but sometimes in clusters, crossing and recrossing\r\neach other on the surface of the shell or rock. Plume-like gills\r\nare attached to the anterior end of the body. The color differs\r\nin different species. These worms may easily be mistaken for the\r\nmollusks /Vermetus/, which live in similar tubes of larger size,\r\ngrowing in masses.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Serpula^\r\n\r\n  ^S. dianthus.^ Tubes often three inches long and one eighth of\r\n  an inch wide, the fixed end coiled and contorted, free end with\r\n  circular opening; tubes often show circular ridges, marking periods\r\n  of growth; operculum funnel-shaped, the exterior striated and the\r\n  edge bordered with short processes; wreath of gills nearly circular\r\n  and divided into two symmetrical parts; color variable. It is found\r\n  in tide-pools, also on the under side of rocks at low-water mark,\r\n  either solitary or congregated in masses, and ranges from Cape Cod\r\n  to New Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Spirorbis^\r\n\r\n  ^S. borealis.^ A minute calcareous tube, in a close, flat coil\r\n  attached on one side; easily mistaken for a minute gasteropod\r\n  shell; worm has an operculum and wreath of gills. Found on the\r\n  fronds of seaweeds, on shells, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS =GEPHYREA=\r\n\r\n\r\nThis class of animals, once placed near the holothurians, belongs\r\nwith the annelid worms on account of their mode of development,\r\ntheir structure being entirely dissimilar. They are without segments\r\nand without parapodia. The body-cavity is filled with fluid and is\r\ntraversed by connective tissue and fine muscular fibers. They are\r\nsubcylindrical animals which can retract the anterior end of the\r\nbody. The mouth is surrounded by tentacles, or by tentacular folds,\r\nand is at the base of the proboscis. They live in fissures of rocks,\r\nin sand, mud, rock, or coral, and in deep gasteropod shells. Their\r\ndistribution is general.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =SIPUNCULOIDEA=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Sipunculus^\r\n\r\n  ^S. nudus.^ The body is cylindrical, a foot or more in length\r\n  when extended. It is divided into two portions. The anterior end,\r\n  to the [pg186] extent of one sixth of the entire length of the\r\n  worm, is capable of being withdrawn into the remainder of the body.\r\n  This portion is called the /introvert/. The introvert is retracted\r\n  by means of special muscles forming a sheath around the gullet\r\n  and connected at the other end to the body-wall about half-way\r\n  down the body. It is narrower than the rest of the body and is\r\n  covered more or less closely with small horny papillæ which turn\r\n  backward and overlap like scales. The rest of the body is divided\r\n  into longitudinal furrows and circular markings, giving it the\r\n  appearance of being divided into squares. These markings correspond\r\n  to muscles which lie beneath. The introvert, when retracted, leaves\r\n  at the opening a lobed and plaited fold of the integument, giving\r\n  the appearance of tentacles. When the introvert is expanded there\r\n  is a fringe-like funnel around the mouth. The body is covered with\r\n  a horny cuticle and has an iridescent luster. The animal lives\r\n  buried in the sand and feeds upon sand, deriving its nourishment\r\n  from the organisms contained therein. The sipunculoids pass so much\r\n  sand and mud through their bodies that they are said to modify the\r\n  mineral substances on the bottom of the sea, as earthworms do the\r\n  soil of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Phascolosoma^\r\n\r\n  ^P. Gouldii.^ Body cylindrical, a foot or more in length, a\r\n  quarter or half of an inch in diameter when expanded; but the\r\n  body constantly changes in size and shape as it is contracted or\r\n  expanded; surface of body parchment-like in texture and marked off\r\n  in small squares; color dull white to light brown. It is found on\r\n  the New England coast in sand and gravel at low-water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nMOLLUSCOIDA\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE MOLLUSCOIDA DESCRIBED IN THIS\r\nCHAPTER\r\n\r\n    Class =POLYZOA=\r\n\r\n      Subclass =Ectoprocta= (/Excretory opening outside lophophore;\r\n        mouth in center of circle of tentacles; tentacles retractile/)\r\n\r\n        Order =GYMNOLÆMATA= (/Circular lophophore/)\r\n\r\n          Suborder ~CYCLOSTOMATA~   (/Tubular calcareous zo[oe]cia,\r\n            with circular apertures devoid of closing apparatus/)\r\n\r\n            Set ARTICULATA (/Erect branches divided at intervals by\r\n              chitinous joints/)\r\n\r\n              Genera            Species\r\n\r\n              ^Crisia^          ^C. eburnea^\r\n\r\n            Set INARTICULATA (/Erect or adherent zoarium; unjointed/)\r\n\r\n              ^Tubulipora^      ^T. flabellaris^\r\n              ^Diastopora^      ^D. patina^\r\n\r\n          Suborder ~CHEILOSTOMATA~   (/Calcareous or chitinous\r\n            zo[oe]cia, usually with opercula; avicularia, vibracula,\r\n            and ovicells often present/)\r\n\r\n            Set CELLULARINA (/Flexible erect forms/)\r\n\r\n\r\n              ^Ætea^            ^Æ. anguinea^\r\n              ^Eucratea^        ^E. chelata^\r\n              ^Cellularia^      ^C. ternata^\r\n              ^Caberea^         ^C.

[pg191]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYZOA\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous objects to be found on the beach at low tide\r\nare the /Polyzoa/, of which there are said to be seventeen hundred\r\nnamed species of the marine forms. These little animals, although\r\nso plentiful, are inconspicuous, and it may be said that their very\r\nexistence is not known to those who are not professed naturalists;\r\nyet they are easy to see, incrusting with a delicate calcareous\r\nlacework the surface of stones and shells and seaweeds in the\r\ntide-pools, and hanging from the rocks like branches of delicate\r\nseaweeds. There is hardly a frond of even the fine red algæ on which\r\ncannot be found the little tube holding shelly saucers, or the\r\ncreeping stems or branches of polyzoans. Any one of these little\r\nmasses, when examined with a pocket-glass, will surprise one with its\r\ndelicate and beautiful structure.\r\n\r\nThis class of animals is also called /Bryozoa/, and certain species\r\nhave the common names of sea-mats and corallines. They are broadly\r\ndivided into two groups, namely, the erect and the incrusting forms.\r\nThose having tree- or plant-like shapes resemble seaweeds, while the\r\ncolonies which spread over stones, shells, and algæ resemble moss,\r\nhence the name /Bryozoa/ (moss-animals). Both groups have the general\r\nappearance of hydroids, because, like them, they are colonies having\r\nplant forms and having their organisms inclosed in cup-like sheaths.\r\nThe resemblance, however, is but a superficial one, for the /Polyzoa/\r\nhave a much higher organization, each animal of the colony being a\r\nseparate and distinct individual. They can easily be distinguished by\r\nthe hair-like processes on the tentacles. The ciliated tentacles and\r\ncomplete alimentary system are the conspicuous differences between\r\nthese colonies and those of the hydroids.\r\n\r\nThe /Polyzoa/ are very numerous and form a most attractive [pg192]\r\ngroup. They are plentiful everywhere, occurring between tide-marks\r\nand at great depths on the floor of the sea. Rocks protected from the\r\nsun are often incrusted with the calcareous forms, while branching\r\nspecies hang from the rocks and adorn rock pools. /Membranipora/,\r\nin lace-like sheets, will be found on the larger seaweeds as well\r\nas on various submerged objects. The beautiful little /Crisia/ may\r\nbe looked for on the fronds of red algæ, and /Alcyonidium/, in soft\r\nmoss-like patches, on /Fucus/. On some beaches are scattered the\r\nsea-mats, /Flustra foliacea/, looking like bits of brown paper. A\r\npocket-lens will reveal the marvelous and orderly arrangement of the\r\ntwo layers of cells, or zo[oe]cia, placed back to back. There is not\r\na more surprising object in the animal kingdom than a living branch\r\nof /Bugula/. The cells on its spiral, profusely branched clusters\r\nhave appendages resembling a bird's head, with its bill constantly\r\nopening and shutting. Of the erect polyzoans some are entirely\r\ncalcareous and rigid; such species live in deep water, and their\r\ncolonies are called corallines, as are also the calcareous algæ. They\r\nhave existed in vast numbers since early geologic times, and are\r\nplentiful in the Tertiary deposits, known as Coralline Crags. Other\r\nerect forms have a calcareous framework, which is not continuous,\r\nbut has horny intervals, so that the colonies are flexible and can\r\nbe swayed by the tides in shallow water where they live. Others\r\nhave complete horny exoskeletons. The same differences occur in the\r\nincrusting forms, those on the seaweeds being either flexible, so\r\nthat they bend with the plant, or if entirely calcareous are so small\r\nthat they do not break when the plant sways to and fro. Still others\r\nare gelatinous and resemble bits of sponge. The calcareous forms are\r\nusually ornamented with ridges which form beautiful patterns.\r\n\r\nThe individuals of the polyzoan colonies are small polyp-like\r\norganisms which have a cup-like inclosure of horny or of calcareous\r\nsubstance, or of the two combined, as mentioned above. This inclosing\r\nsheath is the exterior or cuticle of the animal and is called the\r\n/zo[oe]cium/, the whole colony being called the /zoarium/. The animal\r\nsubstance within the zo[oe]cium is the /polypide/, and consists of\r\nthe mouth, tentacles, and alimentary system. A disk at the anterior\r\nend of the body, bearing the circle of tentacles, is [pg193] the\r\n/lophophore/; it is a contractile body, being, with the tentacles,\r\nprotruded from the zo[oe]cium or drawn within it at will. In some\r\nspecies the orifices of the zo[oe]cia are surrounded with spines;\r\nothers have lids, called /opercula/, which shut down when the\r\npolypides are retracted. A singular modification of the zo[oe]cia is\r\nseen in the genus /Bugula/, where peculiar shapes like birds' heads,\r\ncalled /avicularia/, occur. In these singular appendages the upper\r\nbeak is hooked, while the lower one, or mandible, is the operculum of\r\nthe zo[oe]cium. These constantly open and shut by means of muscles,\r\nand although their function is not certainly known, it is thought\r\nthat they capture prey. Other modifications are whip-like processes,\r\nor flagellate filaments, called /vibracula/, which constantly\r\nbeat the water. In many of the zo[oe]cia of the colony there are\r\ndark-colored masses, called /brown bodies/. These are formed by the\r\ndegeneration of the polypides, which at certain periods break down,\r\ntheir tentacles and alimentary system ceasing to act and becoming\r\nbrown masses. The body-wall then puts out a bud internally and forms\r\na new polypide, which absorbs, or passes out, the brown body. The\r\nterm of life of a single polypide is not known, but in every colony\r\nmany such transformations are constantly taking place.\r\n\r\nThe colonies originally start from larvæ produced in the /ovicells/\r\nof the zoaria. The ovicells are sometimes very large and pear-shaped,\r\noccurring at intervals on the stems; or there may be one at the top\r\nof each zo[oe]cium. They look like pearls. A larva, when liberated,\r\nswims about for a time, then attaches itself to a fixed object, and\r\nincreases, by budding, into some one of the various forms which the\r\ncolonies take.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCLASS =ECTOPROCTA=\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =GYMNOLÆMATA=\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ~CYCLOSTOMATA~\r\n\r\nERECT OR CREEPING POLYZOA\r\n\r\nThe zo[oe]cia are more or less cylindrical; the upper ends are\r\nsometimes completely free and sometimes closely adherent.

[pg202]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECHINODERMATA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe echinoderms, although their shapes are very unlike in the\r\ndifferent classes, have the same general internal structure, and\r\nalso other features which place them together in one group. They are\r\nradiates (page 113) of the highest type; they have an exoskeleton;\r\nand many of them are beset with spines, from which the name is given.\r\nThey have locomotor organs, the /ambulacra/, and a /water-vascular\r\nsystem/ peculiar to themselves. Some have the very strange power of\r\ncasting off, and developing again, parts of the body.\r\n\r\nThe development from the egg to the adult is remarkable, and of\r\nunusual interest to naturalists. The larval stage of echinoderms\r\nis so unlike the mature animal that for a long time the larvæ were\r\nthought to be another class of animals, and therefore were given the\r\nnames which they still retain.\r\n\r\nIn observing echinoderms it will be seen that the dorsal part is\r\ncarried uppermost by some, such as the starfishes and sea-urchins.\r\nIn the former the back is broad and extended; in the latter it is\r\ncurved and contracted. But in crinoids the back is carried downward\r\nand is extended like a stalk; in the sea-cucumbers (holothurians)\r\nthe dorsal and ventral surfaces are parallel with the long axis of\r\nthe cylindrical body, instead of being on a plane with the mouth and\r\nexcretory opening. Owing to the unusual positions of the dorsal and\r\nventral surfaces, the terms /oral/ (mouth side) and /aboral/ (side\r\nopposite the mouth) are generally used in describing these species.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the body is divided definitely by the ambulacra, the\r\n/ambulacral zones/, and the /interambulacral spaces/, but differently\r\nin the different classes. The movement of the animals is [pg203]\r\neffected by means of the tube-feet, or ambulacra. These have suckers,\r\nwhich are attached or released by the power of the water-vascular\r\nsystem. The /madreporic plate/, which can be distinctly seen in\r\nstarfishes at the angle of two of the arms, is a calcareous porous\r\nplate which opens into the /stone-canal/. This canal passes through\r\nthe body and opens into a circular tube which runs around the\r\nmouth. A system of canals extends from this circumoral tube, or\r\n/ring-canal/, and eventually one canal opens into each tube-foot.\r\nWater, entering by the madreporic plate, passes through the various\r\ncanals and into the tube-feet, which it distends. When the feet are\r\npressed against a substance and the water is withdrawn, a vacuum is\r\nformed, which causes the disk-ends of the feet to act like suckers.\r\nWhen the feet are again flooded the hold is relaxed. Thus the animal\r\ndrags its body along with a slow, gliding motion. The madreporic\r\nplate, being calcareous, is said to act as a filter, purifying the\r\nwater as it passes into the body, which it furnishes with oxygen as\r\nwell as with locomotive power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aristotle's lantern.]\r\n\r\nA curious organ found in the /Echinoidea/ (sea-urchins) is called\r\n/Aristotle's lantern/. It is a complicated arrangement, not fully\r\nunderstood, having forty parts, and is connected with the alimentary\r\nsystem. One of the parts is the mouth, over which five teeth project.\r\nThese teeth grasp and grind the food. The exoskeleton is composed\r\nof plates of carbonate of lime, called /ossicles/, which cover the\r\nsurface of the body. The ossicles are of various sizes and shapes,\r\nand are one of the determining features in classification. They may\r\nbe scattered spicules of lime, separated plates joined by connecting\r\nrods, or overlapping plates; or they may be fitted together so as to\r\nform a continuous shell. The starfishes are usually carnivorous, the\r\nsea-urchins usually vegetarian, while the holothurians, after the\r\nmanner of worms, take in sand and mud, deriving their nourishment\r\nfrom the organic particles contained in them. All echinoderms live in\r\nthe sea.

Some have\r\nfive long, spreading arms diverging from a small disk, which is\r\nhardly more than their point of union; others have a large body with\r\nshort arms, which are like angular projections of the body, giving\r\na pentagonal shape. Some genera have a greater number of arms than\r\nothers; /Solaster/ has eleven to thirteen, and /Heliaster/ (the\r\nsun-stars, found on the west tropical coast) has thirty to forty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of water-vascular system of a starfish: /a/,\r\nmadreporite; /b/, stone-canal; /c/, ring-canal; /d/, radial canals;\r\n/e/, ampullæ; /f/, ambulacra.]\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the starfish is in the center of the ventral side. A\r\nventral or /ambulacral groove/ extends through each arm. In these\r\ngrooves the ambulacra, or tube-feet, are arranged in rows. The\r\n/ambulacra/ are hollow, cylindrical bodies, each of which has a\r\nsucker at one end, and is connected at the other end with a little\r\nglobular body, the /ampulla/. The ventral groove forms a ridge in the\r\nbody-cavity. It is called the /ambulacral zone/, and is formed by a\r\ndouble row of elongated plates, which meet and form a raised line\r\nalong the middle of the inside of the arms, and appear like ribs;\r\nbetween them lie the ampullæ. These plates are called the /ambulacral\r\nossicles/. Numerous other ossicles extend over the surface, buried\r\nin the integument of the body, making a calcareous network, or\r\n/exoskeleton/. The ossicles are connected by muscles so that the\r\nanimal is not rigid, but is able to bend the body and even creep\r\nthrough comparatively small places. The ossicles are covered with\r\n/spines/ of two kinds. The very minute ones are the /pedicellariæ/,\r\nand have a jointed end which opens and shuts like a pincers. Their\r\nprincipal use seems to be to remove waste matter or other substances\r\nfrom the body, keeping it free and clean. The pedicellariæ are\r\narranged, in some species, in circles around the [pg206] bases\r\nof the spines, and form groups over the dorsal surface. Examining\r\nthe backs of different starfishes with a strong magnifying-glass,\r\none will be surprised to see the varied grouping of the spines and\r\npedicellariæ. At the extremity of each arm is a red eye-spot, which\r\nis sensitive to light, and a tube-foot, which has no sucker and which\r\nis believed to act both as an olfactory and as a feeling organ. The\r\nmadreporic plate lies at the angle of two of the arms or rays. Water\r\nfilters through the madreporic plate and passes by the stone-canal to\r\nthe ring-canal around the mouth, and thence to the radial tubes, one\r\nof which extends through each arm and is connected by a branch with\r\neach tube-foot. At the base of each tube-foot there is a globular\r\nreservoir, or ampulla. A valve connects the tube-foot and ampulla.\r\nWhen the ampulla is contracted, water is forced into and distends\r\nthe tube-foot; when the ampulla is distended, it withdraws the water\r\nfrom the tube-foot, thus acting like a suction-bulb. When water\r\nis sent into the tube-feet they are greatly extended and are then\r\nplaced against an object. The water being then withdrawn through the\r\nampullæ, a vacuum is formed, and the suckers are tightly attached.\r\nBy the alternating movements of the ambulacra the animal is dragged\r\nslowly along and moves with a gliding motion. It does not deviate\r\nfrom a straight path, going over elevations or through depressions\r\nwithout turning aside; its body conforms to the irregularities of\r\nthe road and never bridges over spaces. The stomach extends a little\r\nway into the arms, and a short intestine leads to the excretory\r\nopening in the center of the back. Starfishes are carnivorous and\r\nvoracious, and are particularly [pg207] destructive to oyster-beds.\r\nThe animal fastens itself to a bivalve, and protrudes a part of its\r\nstomach, with which it envelops its prey and slowly sucks it out of\r\nits shell. When feeding on small mollusks they take them into the\r\nstomach directly. Starfishes regain by natural growth parts of the\r\nbody which may be lost. Sometimes the animal throws off an arm to\r\nescape capture, and self-mutilation also occurs where unfavorable\r\nconditions exist. Oystermen formerly were ignorant of the starfish's\r\nwonderful powers of regeneration, and were in the habit of cutting\r\nup those captured in their forks and throwing them overboard, thus\r\nincreasing the number instead of destroying their enemies, as each\r\narm with a piece of the body attached to it will, it is said, become\r\na new individual. This tenacity of life makes starfishes difficult\r\nto destroy, and they are exceedingly plentiful in all seas. One\r\nnaturalist speaks of seeing on the coast of Maine a bed of starfishes\r\nwhich extended several miles and covered the bottom so closely that\r\nhe picked sixty individuals off a small stone. On the northern\r\nshores of the Pacific coast they abound in great variety, and some\r\nare of unusual size. /Asterias gigantea/ of this region measures\r\ntwo feet across. Another species, /Phyncopodia helianthoides/,\r\nmeasures a yard in diameter, and has twenty or more arms. The most\r\ncommon species of the Atlantic coast are /Asterias vulgaris/ and /A.\r\nForbesii/; the former ranges from Long Island northward, the latter\r\nfrom Massachusetts to Florida. These are the species particularly\r\ndestructive to oyster-beds. /Asterias vulgaris/ sometimes grows to be\r\nfifteen inches in diameter; from this, which is perhaps the largest,\r\nare found starfishes of all sizes down to the very small /Cribrella/.\r\nThey inhabit all varieties of bottoms, from low-water mark to deep\r\nwater. They are not always abundant in the same place, but seem to\r\nmove about.\r\n\r\nSome oystermen believe that the starfishes get into masses like a\r\nball and are rolled along by the tide. This idea comes from the fact\r\nthat an oyster-bed may be free from them one day and the next be\r\ncovered by these pests. To get rid of them the beds are swept over\r\nwith a tangle, which is an iron bar holding swabs of raveled rope.\r\nThe spines of the starfish are caught in the [pg208] tangle, and\r\noften hundreds are brought up in one haul and are then killed by\r\nsteaming.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical system of the starfish is easily traced by cutting\r\noff, with scissors, the skin from the dorsal surface of the disk, and\r\nalso cutting a slit down one of the arms. In the center of the body\r\nwill be seen the upper part of the stomach, a small star-like spot,\r\nfrom which radiate five branches, which divide and lead into the\r\nmuch-ramified, plume-like organs which extend through the arms. These\r\nare the pyloric cæca, whose function is to secrete the digestive\r\nfluids. The much-folded stomach occupies the greater part of the\r\ncentral space, its large convolutions showing on top. The mouth\r\nconnects with the stomach on the ventral side. By turning back the\r\nskin from the arm, small filiform processes can in some large species\r\nbe seen; these are the dermal branchiæ, or breathing-organs, which\r\nmay either project through pores in the skin between the ossicles or\r\nbe entirely retracted. If the pyloric cæca be laid back, one can see\r\nthe rib-like arrangement of the ambulacral ossicles, and also the\r\nampullæ, which lie between the ossicles on each side of the ridge. If\r\nan ampulla be inflated and then pressed, the corresponding tube-foot\r\nwill be seen to extend. To follow successfully the water-vascular\r\nsystem, beginning in the madreporic plate and extending through the\r\nstone-canal to the ring-canal around the mouth and thence through the\r\narms, requires a strong glass and more skilful manipulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =PHANEROZONIA=\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~PORCELLANASTERIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ctenodiscus^ (Plate LII.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. corniculatus.^ Pentagonal; about two and a half inches in\r\n  diameter; the body flat, with wide marginal plates, giving a\r\n  flat edge to the rather long, pointed arms; madreporic plate\r\n  large; color greenish; ambulacra without suckers, seeming to be\r\n  adapted to pushing through soft mud rather than dragging over hard\r\n  surfaces. It lives in deep water on muddy bottoms and ranges from\r\n  Massachusetts to Greenland. When dredged the animal is usually\r\n  found to be filled with soft mud.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~ASTROPECTINIDÆ~\r\n\r\nIn this family there are only two rows of tube-feet; the rays end in\r\nsharp points and have large ossicles on the margins. [pg209]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Astropecten^\r\n\r\n  ^A. articularis.^ The body is flat and smooth; the rays sharply\r\n  pointed and conspicuously bordered with marginal ossicles and\r\n  fringed with short spines; two rows of ambulacral feet; color rich\r\n  purple.

[pg210] It has a large, pentagonal, bright-scarlet\r\n  disk, five to six inches in diameter, with arms rather long and\r\n  pointed. The upper side is raised and cushion-like, and is covered\r\n  with blunt spines; the margins have larger spines of the same\r\n  shape. The pedicellariæ are sessile and so long and large as to be\r\n  easily seen with the naked eye. (Plate LII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~PENTACEROTIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pentaceros^\r\n\r\n  ^P. occidentalis.^ Pentagonal; eight to twelve inches in diameter;\r\n  ossicles a network of rod-like plates, with prominent spines at\r\n  the points of union; body inflated in the center and running in\r\n  wedge-like form to the ends of the rather long and narrow arms; the\r\n  upper lines of the ridges have spines more prominent than those\r\n  on the rest of the body; the spines of the larger specimens are\r\n  more like large warts or small hemispheres. Found on the Lower\r\n  California coast.\r\n\r\n  ^P. reticularis.^ This starfish is the largest species on our\r\n  coasts. It is common in southern Florida close to the shore. The\r\n  body is three to four inches thick, flat on the oral surface, but\r\n  raised on the upper side, and tapers down in wedge-like form to the\r\n  points of the short arms. The prominent blunt spines which cover\r\n  its surface are arranged in a somewhat regular net-like order, and\r\n  the sharp-edged margins have an even row of larger spines of the\r\n  same form. The madreporic plate is nearly in the center of the\r\n  disk, and is quite conspicuous, being bordered with a circle of\r\n  small spines. Its color is dull yellow, and its size often a foot\r\n  or more in diameter. It is the large starfish so often seen in\r\n  curiosity-shops. (Plate LII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Nidorella^\r\n\r\n  ^N. armata.^ This very curious pentagonal species, found on the\r\n  California coast, is five to six inches in diameter and red in\r\n  color. The upper surface is raised and covered with thick, pointed\r\n  spines one half of an inch to one inch long, arranged in lines, but\r\n  not crowded. The ossicles on the margins are large; some of them\r\n  are hemispherical and bear large spines. Smaller spines border the\r\n  under edge of the margins. (Plate LIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~ASTERINIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThe starfishes of this family are pentagonal, with a large body and\r\nshort arms. The disk is more or less elevated in the center, and the\r\nedges are sharp. There are two rows of ambulacra. The ossicles are\r\nnotched and overlapping. The family is confined to temperate and\r\ntropical waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Asterina^\r\n\r\n  ^A. folium.^ Small, pentagonal, swollen (gibbous).

(Plate LIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~ECHINASTERIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cribrella^\r\n\r\n  ^C. sanguinolenta.^ This species is abundant north of Cape Cod and\r\n  is found of all sizes from half an inch to two inches in diameter\r\n  and of various colors--purple, orange, red, yellow, flesh-color,\r\n  etc. It has five round arms, generally about four times as long as\r\n  the breadth of the disk. The ends are often turned upward. It is\r\n  covered with crowded short spines, like little warts, which give\r\n  it a nearly smooth surface. It has two rows of ambulacra. It moves\r\n  with two of its arms turned forward, as if they were dragging the\r\n  other three behind them. Unlike most species, the young are not\r\n  free-swimming, but the eggs are carried around the mouth of the\r\n  mother, and the young are retained there until they are capable of\r\n  taking care or themselves. (Plate LIV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Echinaster^\r\n\r\n  ^E. sentus.^ This species occurs close to shore in the waters of\r\n  Florida and is perhaps the most commonly observed species on the\r\n  beach. It extends as far north as New Jersey. It is purplish in\r\n  color, and about four and a half inches in diameter, with two rows\r\n  of ambulacra, five arms, and a surface rough with spines. [pg212]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~HELIASTERIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Heliaster^\r\n\r\n  ^H. multiradiata.^ Spines on the upper surface of rays in five\r\n  rows, but close to the disk proper become reduced to one row. Found\r\n  on the coasts of Lower California and Mexico. (Plate LIV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~ASTERIIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThe /Asteriidæ/ have the following characteristics: four rows\r\nof tube-feet; ossicles small and unequal; spines isolated or\r\ngrouped; pedicellariæ of two forms, forceps-like and scissors-like\r\nrespectively. They include the very common forms found on all beaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Asterias^\r\n\r\n  ^A. vulgaris.^ The common starfish of the Atlantic coast, from\r\n  Long Island Sound to Labrador. It occurs at low-water mark and\r\n  extends into deep water. It has five arms, which taper to a point.\r\n  Large specimens measure fifteen inches across. The upper surface\r\n  is rough, being covered with short spines, which are largest and\r\n  thickest at the edges of the rays, and surrounding them are the\r\n  pedicellariæ. The color varies from pink, yellow, and brown to\r\n  purple.\r\n\r\n  ^A. Forbesii.^ The common starfish of the Atlantic coast, from\r\n  Massachusetts Bay to the Gulf of Mexico. This species resembles\r\n  very closely /A. vulgaris/, but can be distinguished from it by\r\n  the madreporic plate, which is bright orange, while in the former\r\n  it has the same color as the animal; also the arms are a little\r\n  swollen at the base and terminate more bluntly. These two species\r\n  are very destructive to oyster-beds, especially where their ranges\r\n  overlap. It is computed that they destroy annually two hundred\r\n  thousand dollars' worth of oysters. Vast numbers congregate where\r\n  the feeding-ground is good, and move in long lines from place\r\n  to place. The oystermen dredge over the beds and bring them up\r\n  in thousands, then steam them or throw them on the shore above\r\n  high-water mark. (Plate LIV.)\r\n\r\n  ^A. ochracea.^ The common starfish of the Pacific coast, from\r\n  Sitka to San Diego. Five rays, each hardly twice as long as the\r\n  diameter of the body; spines running irregularly over the surface,\r\n  but forming a pentagon at the middle of the disk and inclosing the\r\n  madreporic plate; diameter eight inches. It is very common near San\r\n  Francisco on rocks at low-water mark. (Plate LIV.)\r\n\r\n  ^A. gigantea.^ Body very large and swollen; six rays, somewhat\r\n  less in length than twice the diameter of the disk; aboral surface\r\n  covered with numerous short, blunt, equidistant spines of uniform\r\n  size and regularly distributed; spines contracted at the base and\r\n  striated; diameter two feet. Found on the California coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LIV. Cribrella sanguinolenta. Heliaster\r\nmultiradiata. Asterias Forbesii.

In starfishes the arms are\r\nextensions of the body, and the viscera extend partway into them,\r\nwhile in ophiurans the body is a central disk, with the five narrow\r\narms attached to its margin. In form they suggest a spider, and\r\nsometimes are called sea-spiders. The name brittle-star is also\r\ndescriptive, since they break off their limbs readily. The arms are\r\nnarrow, taper to a point, usually curl at the ends, and have no\r\nambulacral grooves, but are completely covered with bare calcareous\r\nplates (except in the first order, where they have a skin and no\r\nplates). The ambulacra are small spines without suckers, which\r\nemanate from the sides or margins of the arms and do not serve for\r\nwalking. The madreporic plate is on the ventral surface, in one of\r\nthe circular shields which surround the mouth. The alimentary canal\r\nends blindly. The egg-sacs lie between the arms and open by slits on\r\nthe under side, close to the arms, where they join the disk. Water\r\nflows in and out of these pouches, which are thought to have also\r\nrespiratory and excretory functions. No eye-specks have been found,\r\nbut they must exist, since the animal is sensible to approaching\r\ndanger and quickly retreats. The ophiurans are more active than\r\nstarfishes, moving by wriggling, and clambering with their arms. They\r\nare shy and hard to find, and it is difficult to capture a whole one,\r\nsince they throw off pieces of their arms at the least alarm. Often\r\nthey completely dismember themselves, an action which does them no\r\npermanent injury, since they reproduce lost parts. They are more\r\ncommonly inhabitants of deep than of shallow waters, and are brought\r\nup from the bottom in dredges in great numbers. [pg215] Some species\r\nmay be found near low-water mark under stones and in clusters of\r\nmussels, and often in seaweeds, thrown up from deep water, on the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =EURYALIDA=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Astrophyton^ (Plate LV.)\r\n\r\n  ^A. Agassizii.^ This very singular ophiuran is commonly called the\r\n  basket-fish, from its resemblance to a basket when the tentacles\r\n  are rolled up. Its body is covered with skin instead of calcareous\r\n  plates. The body is thick and somewhat circular in form, with\r\n  elevated radiating ridges on the upper side, and the skin is marked\r\n  off in star-like divisions. From the margin of the body extend\r\n  five arms, which at once divide in a forking manner; each section\r\n  again divides, and this division in pairs (dichotomous division)\r\n  continues until the ends of the arms have become very numerous and\r\n  attenuated. The arms are carried curled up or straight at will. In\r\n  moving, the animal seems to walk on these branches as if on tiptoe,\r\n  and in this position it forms a kind of net which entraps prey. The\r\n  arms and prominent parts of the disk are yellow, and the depressed\r\n  or membranous parts brown. /Astrophyton/ is six to eighteen inches\r\n  in diameter. It is found off the northern New England coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =OPHIURIDA=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ophiopholis^\r\n\r\n  ^O. aculeata.^ This is a common species, found in shallow water\r\n  on the North Atlantic coast. A similar or perhaps identical\r\n  species occurs on the North Pacific coast. It is spotted purple or\r\n  variegated in color. The upper surface of the body is covered with\r\n  plates variously arranged, sometimes in the shape of a star, and\r\n  each one is surrounded with small spines. The under side of the\r\n  egg-sacs is covered with small spines. These sacs open by slits on\r\n  each side next the arms, and have a rounded appearance, bulging\r\n  out between the arms. The arms, which are long and attenuated at\r\n  the ends, have on the upper side transverse oval plates surrounded\r\n  by a border of flat, roundish granules. Sometimes the plates are\r\n  divided into two or three pieces, when they are similarly bordered\r\n  with granules. The arms are fringed with rows of thick, compressed,\r\n  obtuse spines, generally six in each row. The under sides of the\r\n  arms have large quadrangular plates slightly separated from one\r\n  another and extending across the whole surface in regular, even\r\n  rows. (Plate LV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Amphiura^\r\n\r\n  ^A. squamata.^ This very delicate species, found on shelly bottoms\r\n  below low-water mark from New Jersey northward, has a body less\r\n  than one quarter of an inch in diameter, with arms two inches or\r\n  more [pg216] in length and thread-like in size. These long,\r\n  slender arms have, on both the upper and under surfaces, a row of\r\n  overlapping plates, and are fringed with small spines, three in a\r\n  row. The color is gray or whitish, sometimes marked with darker\r\n  gray or brown. (Plate LV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ophiocoma^\r\n\r\n  ^O. riisei^, ^O. æthiops^, ^O. Alexandri^. These animals have\r\n  long spines on the sides of the arms, which give them a bushy\r\n  appearance. The surface of the body is granulated, but the arms\r\n  are covered with wide plates. Their color is brown above and light\r\n  beneath. /O. riisei/ is found at Key West, the other two species on\r\n  the coast of Lower California. (Plate LV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ophiothrix^\r\n\r\n  ^O. angulata.^ Body covered with short, rough spines; egg-sacs\r\n  conspicuous and extend like lobes between the arms; rays narrow and\r\n  thickly beset with long spines, which are serrated on the edges and\r\n  ends. Found on the Florida coast. (Plate LV.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LV. Astrophyton. Ophiocoma æthiops Ophiothrix\r\nangulata. Ophiopholis aculeata. Ophiocoma Alexandri.

The plates are so united that externally the marks of\r\njuncture are not perceptible, but on the interior the shape of these\r\nplates is well defined. In examining such a shell, or test (they\r\nabound on the beach), it will be seen that its surface is covered\r\nwith numerous hemispherical projections or knobs, which are grouped\r\nin double rows and run in meridional lines from one pole to the\r\nother of the more or less spherical body, separating it into ten\r\ndivisions. Five of these divisions have perforations, or small pores\r\nin the plates of the shell, and are called the /ambulacral zones/\r\nor areas, because through these pores pass the small tubes, in the\r\nliving animal, which connect the tube-feet, or /ambulacra/, with the\r\nradial water-canals and the /ampullæ/ (see page 206). The wide spaces\r\nbetween these double rows of pores are called the /interambulacral\r\nzones/ or areas. The ten spaces diverge from the /peristome/, or\r\nsoft part around the mouth, in the center of the lower surface, and\r\nconverge in the small area at the top or aboral side. In the center\r\nof this small circular dorsal space is the excretory opening, and\r\nsurrounding it are ten plates, five of which have openings into the\r\negg-sacs. One of them is larger than the others, and is modified to\r\nform the /madreporic plate/. The other five plates have eye-specks.\r\nThe ambulacral zones terminate at these ocular plates.\r\n\r\nThe numerous spines which cover the animal are of three [pg219]\r\nkinds, and proceed from the knobs on the exoskeleton, over which they\r\nfit, forming ball-and-socket joints, which enable them to move in\r\nany direction. The long spines are ribbed, and seem to have no other\r\nfunction than that of protection. The second set, the /pedicellariæ/,\r\nare very peculiar small organs scattered over the surface in great\r\nnumbers, and consisting of a head bearing three bill-like blades\r\nmounted on a long, flexible stalk. The office of some of the\r\npedicellariæ is to remove waste from the excretory opening; this is\r\npassed down regular lines and dropped into the water, thus keeping\r\nthe body clean. Others are constantly opening and shutting their\r\nforks, reaching in all directions and grasping and removing anything\r\nwhich may have become entangled in the spines. They also capture\r\nfloating bits of seaweed, which they drag over the body to conceal\r\nit. A third set of projections are the /sphæridia/, small globular\r\nbodies said to be connected with perception.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Test of sea-urchin, with the spines removed to show\r\nthe arrangement of the plates, lateral view: /Amb/, ambulacral zone\r\nwith its perforated plates; /Ap/, apical (aboral) pole; /Int. amb./,\r\ninterambulacral zones. (From Bronn's \"Thierreich.\")]\r\n\r\nThe spines vary greatly in size, number, and form in different\r\nspecies, and are such conspicuous features as to make the\r\nidentification of species easy. In some the spines are solid and\r\nfluted; [pg220] in others they are hollow, sharp, and brittle; again\r\nin others they are short and silky, or very long and serrated, and so\r\non. In one species they are so broad and flat as to resemble little\r\nsails. (See /Dorocidaris/.) (Plate LVI.)\r\n\r\nThe mouth, over which five long teeth project, is a part of\r\nAristotle's lantern, which forms a curious and prominent feature in\r\nthe center of the lower surface. Ten tentacles, like large tube-feet\r\nwithout suckers, lie around the mouth. The alimentary canal, starting\r\nin Aristotle's lantern, winds in two and a half coils around the\r\ninside of the shell, supported by mesenteries, and terminates in the\r\nexcretory opening on the aboral surface. The sea-urchin has also\r\na water-vascular system similar to that of starfishes (page 206).\r\nWhen the tube-feet are distended they project beyond the spines, and\r\nenable the animal to move slowly about; but sea-urchins are less\r\nactive than starfishes, and although they are so well protected by\r\nspines and have few enemies after maturity, they lie in sluggish\r\nidleness in secluded places, and for further concealment often cover\r\nthemselves with seaweeds or stones.\r\n\r\nThe sea-urchin has a nervous system, which starts in a ring around\r\nthe mouth, ramifies through the body, and terminates in the\r\neye-plates. The tube-feet and all the spines are under nervous as\r\nwell as muscular control. Egg-sacs lie under the apex of the shell\r\nand open by separate ducts into the five plates on the small upper\r\ndisk. Through these the eggs are discharged into the water, where\r\nthey become free-swimming larvæ, called /Pluteus/. This immature\r\nsea-urchin (Pluteus) undergoes several curious transformations in\r\nthe course of its development, and does not in any way resemble the\r\nmature animal. In spring the apical disk of the females will often\r\nbe found covered with orange-colored ova, and that of the males with\r\nwhite sperms. In the growth of the animal, in its mature form, the\r\nshell enlarges by accretions of lime on the individual plates, or\r\nossicles, of the exoskeleton, and by new plates formed around the\r\napical disk. Sea-urchins are compared to starfishes folded over, the\r\neye-specks on the ends of the rays meeting in a small area around\r\nthe excretory opening, the ambulacra following spherical lines and\r\nleaving the mouth, as before, on the ventral side. [pg221]\r\n\r\nThe /Echinoidea/ present great differences in shape, being more or\r\nless spherical, oval, discoid, and heart-shaped. These variations are\r\nassociated with the differences of internal structure, the openings\r\nof the digestive tract being at the opposite poles in the spherical\r\nand oval forms, but excentric in the disk- and heart-shaped species.\r\nThe sea-urchins are grouped in three orders in accordance with these\r\nvariations. All are characterized by the absence of arms, by having\r\nthe calcareous plates immovably united to form a firm test, and by\r\nthe great development of the movable spines upon the plates.\r\n\r\nSea-urchins are sometimes called /sea-eggs/, perhaps from their\r\nshape, but possibly from the edible quality of some species, which\r\nare eaten by the natives of the shore, who take them at the spawning\r\nseason, when the egg-sacs are distended. They are gregarious, and\r\nfrequently are so crowded together as literally to pave the surface\r\nof rocks and the bottoms of tide-pools in sheltered places. The\r\nfollowing is quoted from A. Agassiz: \"Many of the /Desmosticha/\r\nalong coasts exposed to the action of the waves live in cavities\r\nwhich they hollow out of the solid rock. This they do, not by means\r\nof any solvent, but by mere mechanical action. They chisel out with\r\ntheir teeth the solid rock by incessant turning round and round, and\r\nkeep their cave, where they are frequently prisoners for the rest\r\nof their existence, up to the size required by the growth of their\r\ntest and spines, by constant gnawing. On the coast of California the\r\ncommon /Strongylocentrotus purpuratus/ occurs in this way. We find\r\nlong tracts of shore, where this sea-urchin is common, completely\r\nhoneycombed and pitted by cavities and depressions in which they seek\r\nshelter against the powerful surf continually beating against the\r\nrocks. The same species does not excavate in sheltered places, where\r\nthe sea-urchins can find protection between the interstices of large\r\nfragments of rock or ledges more or less sheltered from the more\r\ndirect action of the open sea.\"\r\n\r\nSea-urchins in cavities of granite rock, where the openings are too\r\nsmall for the animal to get out, are to be seen in thousands on the\r\ncoast of France at Croisic, Lower Loire. Spines of large sea-urchins\r\nare used as slate-pencils by the missionaries in the Pacific\r\nIslands. [pg222]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CIDARIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cidaris^\r\n\r\n  ^C. tribuloides.^ Similar to /Porocidaris sharreri/, but with\r\n  thicker and stouter spines. Found from South Carolina to Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Dorocidaris^\r\n\r\n  ^D. papillota.^ A deep-water species which occurs off Chesapeake\r\n  Bay and southward. It has slender spines with distinct longitudinal\r\n  rows of serrations, and the spines are grouped in rosette-like\r\n  forms over the small spherical body.\r\n\r\n  ^D. Blakei.^ This species is very peculiar in having broad,\r\n  fan-shaped spines; vermilion in color. Found in deep water in the\r\n  Bahamas and West Indies. (Plate LVII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Porocidaris^\r\n\r\n  ^P. sharreri.^ This species occurs, in deep water, off the coast of\r\n  North Carolina and thence southward to the West Indies. The shell\r\n  is light greenish-pink. The spines are white, with brownish-pink\r\n  at the base, pointed, three and a half inches long, and surrounded\r\n  at the base with small, flat, triangular, secondary spines. (Plate\r\n  LVII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~ARBACIADÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Arbacia^\r\n\r\n  ^A. punctulata.^ A small species found in shallow water on shelly\r\n  and gravelly bottoms from Massachusetts to Mexico, and common\r\n  in Long Island Sound. The shell is about one inch in diameter;\r\n  the spines are rather thick and one half to three quarters of an\r\n  inch long. The color varies from deep violet--almost black--to\r\n  straw-color, and the spines are tipped with brown. The South\r\n  Carolina species are usually brick-red in the bare interambulacral\r\n  spaces, with darker sutures, and spines tipped with same color. The\r\n  animal walks by means of its spines, with a tilting motion, and\r\n  advances quite rapidly. (Plate LVII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^C[oe]lopleurus^\r\n\r\n  ^C. floridanus.^ This beautiful sea-urchin is taken on the Florida\r\n  reefs.

The\r\n  spines are one half of an inch to one inch long, thick at the base\r\n  and tapering to a point. The color is dark purplish-green to deep\r\n  violet--almost black.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Strongylocentrotus^\r\n\r\n  ^S. drobachiensis.^ This sea-urchin (which bears, perhaps, the\r\n  longest name in technical nomenclature and has no other, unless\r\n  that of \"sea-egg,\" which is applied indiscriminately to all\r\n  sea-urchins) is a very common species in shallow waters of the\r\n  northern temperate zones. It extends as far as New Jersey on the\r\n  Atlantic and to the State of Washington on the Pacific coast.\r\n  Although it is found as far south as New Jersey, it is there rare\r\n  and small; but farther north, especially on the coast of Maine,\r\n  it is exceedingly abundant. It is green or greenish-purple in\r\n  color, and resembles somewhat a large chestnut-bur. The body is\r\n  circular, somewhat depressed (but of variable thickness), and\r\n  about two inches in diameter. The spines are moderately slender\r\n  and longitudinally striated. It feeds partly on diatoms and other\r\n  small algæ, which it cuts from the rocks with its sharp teeth. It\r\n  also devours dead fishes, bones and all, and in return is swallowed\r\n  whole by the wolffish and other large fishes. It moves by means\r\n  of the tube-feet on its oral surface, slowly dragging itself\r\n  along, and frequently is seen with seaweed, a stone, or some other\r\n  substance on its back, which it places there with its pedicellariæ\r\n  for the purpose of concealment.\r\n\r\n  ^S. purpuratus.^ The common purple sea-urchin of the west coast,\r\n  from Sitka to Lower California, found in abundance on the rocks\r\n  just beyond low-water mark. It is about one and a half inches in\r\n  diameter, with rather thick, pointed, and fluted spines.\r\n\r\n  ^S. franciscanus.^ This is the largest species of the west coast,\r\n  the shell measuring sometimes five inches across, and the thick\r\n  spines one and a half inches in length. The tubercles on the naked\r\n  shells are very prominent, and the zones are very clearly marked.\r\n  It is purple in color and is often found in great quantities at\r\n  low-water mark. It ranges from Alaska to Lower California. (Plate\r\n  LVII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~ECHINIDÆ~\r\n\r\nIn this family the ambulacral plates have but three pairs of pores.\r\n[pg224]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Echinus^\r\n\r\n  ^E. gracilis.^ This is a deep-water species, which occurs from\r\n  Cape Cod southward. The shell is nearly spherical, but is a\r\n  little depressed on the oral side, and has twenty bands of color,\r\n  alternately green and white. The spines are short and thin.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Toxopneustes^\r\n\r\n  ^T. variegatus.^ This is the common species of the Southern States,\r\n  from North Carolina southward, and is found in shallow water in\r\n  protected places. The shell is nearly globular; the spines vary in\r\n  thickness and color, some being long, slender, and greenish, while\r\n  others have stout and blunt spines of a yellowish or violet tint.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =CLYPEASTROIDEA=\r\n\r\nCAKE-URCHINS\r\n\r\nThe animals of this order, commonly known as sand-cakes or\r\nsand-dollars, are flat and circular like disks. Sometimes they are\r\ncut at intervals on the margin; again they have slits through the\r\nbody (/lunules/). They have a well-marked star-shaped figure on the\r\ndorsal surface. This figure is formed by the ambulacra, or tube-feet,\r\nwhich run in five rounded or petal-shaped lines on the under surface.\r\nThe mouth, in Aristotle's lantern, is in the center of the somewhat\r\nconcave ventral surface, the petal-like ambulacral zones meeting at\r\nthe central space. The excretory opening is on the margin of the\r\ndisk, at a point between two of the sections of the star-like figure.\r\nThis marks the posterior part of the body, while the opposite arm\r\nof the star marks the front or anterior end. The spines are very\r\nfine and silky, and are spread abundantly over the whole animal.\r\nClypeasteroids are mainly found in sand considerably below low-water\r\nmark, though some species thrive where they are exposed to the surf\r\non open sandy beaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~ECHINANTHIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Clypeaster^\r\n\r\n  ^C. ravenellii.^ This species occurs in deep water from South\r\n  Carolina southward. The disk is about four inches in diameter,\r\n  and is raised [pg225] in the center into a large cone. The\r\n  ambulacra run down the sides of the cone in straight lines, and\r\n  around the base is a depressed area which emphasizes a thick border\r\n  which extends around the scalloped margin. The color is light\r\n  yellowish-brown. (Plate LVIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Echinanthus^\r\n\r\n  ^E. rosaceus.^ This is a large species, oblong in shape, about\r\n  four to five inches across and much rounded on top, the body being\r\n  about two inches thick. The ambulacral zones are depressed, leaving\r\n  prominent elevations which make a very conspicuous figure on the\r\n  top. The color is light chocolate-brown. Found close to the shore\r\n  off the coasts of Florida, South Carolina, and the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~SCUTELLIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Echinarachnius^\r\n\r\nTHE SAND-DOLLARS\r\n\r\n  ^E. parma.^ This species, the shells of which are very common\r\n  objects on sand-beaches from New Jersey northward, is generally\r\n  known as the sand-dollar. The animals have flat circular disks\r\n  about three inches in diameter. The ambulacral zones, in five\r\n  petal-like lines, form a distinct figure on the upper surface. The\r\n  mouth is in the center of the ventral surface, and the excretory\r\n  opening is on the edge of the disk. In life they are covered\r\n  with short, fine, silky spines, which seem like hair, and are\r\n  purplish-brown in color, but turn green when taken from the water.\r\n  The sand-dollars are exceedingly abundant off Nantucket Shoals,\r\n  where the bottom seems paved with them. They are eaten in great\r\n  numbers by flounders, cod, and haddock. When put in alcohol they\r\n  stain it a dark color. Fishermen prepare an indelible ink by\r\n  grinding to powder these animals and mixing it with some liquid.\r\n  This species is also found on the northern Pacific coast.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Echinarachnius parma/, the sand-dollar. Much\r\n  smaller than natural size.]\r\n\r\n  ^E. excentricus.^ This is the common sand-dollar of the Pacific\r\n  coast. The disk, instead of being circular as in /E. parma/, is\r\n  somewhat straight across the posterior end, and the posterior\r\n  ambulacral zones are shorter than the other three. The upper side\r\n  of the disk is raised, forming a cone-like elevation, the apex\r\n  being the center of the figure.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Mellita^\r\n\r\n  ^M. testudinata.^ The disk is rounded in front and straight in the\r\n  back. Four long, narrow lunules, or cuts, occur on the sides in\r\n  line with the ambulacral, petal-shaped zones, but do not extend\r\n  quite to the edge of the disk; and a wide lunule occurs in the\r\n  interambulacral space [pg226] of the posterior end. The three\r\n  anterior zones are shorter than the posterior pair. On the upper\r\n  side of the disk the spines all turn toward the periphery. The\r\n  color of the living animal is greenish-blue. It is very abundant\r\n  from Cape Hatteras southward in shallow water, and the shells are\r\n  sometimes found as far north as Cape Cod. (Plate LVIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Encope^\r\n\r\n  ^E. michelini.^ Ambulacral zones unequal in size, the posterior\r\n  pair usually longer than the others; lunules like notches in the\r\n  margin, with a large one opening between the posterior ambulacral\r\n  zones nearly in the center of the disk; disk rounded in front and\r\n  square at the back. Common on the coasts of southern Florida and\r\n  the Gulf of Mexico in shallow water. (Plate LVIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =SPATANGOIDEA=\r\n\r\nHEART-URCHINS\r\n\r\nThe /Spatangoidea/, or heart-urchins, have heart-shaped or thick\r\nelliptical bodies. The mouth and excretory opening are both away from\r\nthe center and on the ventral side. These animals seem deformed, so\r\nmuch are they out of symmetry and so different in outline from the\r\nother orders of the class. The ambulacral zones are in circles, or\r\npetaloid in outline, as in cake-urchins, but are not continuous, and\r\nthe anterior one is usually unlike the others and frequently without\r\npores. The entire body is covered with spines, and these are the\r\nchief organs of locomotion; the greater part of them turn backward,\r\ngiving the living animal the semblance of a porcupine. The mouth is\r\nprotected by a projecting plate, but Aristotle's lantern is absent\r\nin this order. The anatomy is in general the same as in the other\r\norders, but the organs are turned in conformity with the inclosing\r\nshell. Most of these animals bury themselves in sand or mud and live\r\nin deep water; a few only are littoral species.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~SPATANGOIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS =Moira=\r\n\r\n  ^M. atropos.^ Size about one inch by one and a half inches, and one\r\n  inch thick; color yellowish-white, with brown spines.

In form they are cylindrical,\r\nand, when the tentacles and tube-feet are retracted, resemble fat\r\nworms; when fully expanded they are somewhat like sea-anemones, the\r\ntentacles forming a rosette-like top. The walls of the body are tough\r\nand muscular, with small calcareous deposits or spicules of various\r\nshapes in the skin. The mouth is at one end, the excretory opening\r\nat the other, and along the body are double rows of tube-feet. Often\r\ninstead of tube-feet, or together with them, are conical processes\r\nwithout suckers. The ambulacra, when arranged in regular zones, are\r\nused for locomotion only in the lines running from the madreporic\r\nplate. In some species three of the zones are near together, and form\r\na kind of sole on which the animal creeps; again the tube-feet are\r\nwholly suppressed, as in /Synapta/. Besides progressing by means of\r\nthese suckers, the holothurians move, as do worms, by the extension\r\nand contraction of the body. The inner surface of the tough membrane\r\ninclosing the body is lined with powerful longitudinal and transverse\r\nmuscles, by means of which the creature contracts and lengthens its\r\nbody and changes its form in a wonderful manner. Around the mouth\r\nare tentacles, which are often much branched and are used as organs\r\nof touch and smell, and sometimes have an ear-sac at the base. From\r\nthe mouth the food-canal, making one long coil, extends to a chamber\r\n [pg231] (/cloaca/) at the other pole. The cloaca gives off a pair\r\nof much-branched respiratory trees, which are constantly supplied\r\nwith water by the contractions of the cloaca. At the base of one of\r\nthe respiratory trees are singular structures known as /Cuvierian\r\norgans/. They are numerous, viscid, glandular tubes, which the animal\r\ncan throw out, and which will adhere closely to almost anything. The\r\nholothurian has a water-vascular system, the madreporic plate being\r\nnear the mouth, but not opening to the outside, and a nervous system\r\nwhich starts from a ring which lies around the mouth. The egg-sacs\r\nare branched tubes, often highly colored, which open to the outside,\r\nclose to the wreath of tentacles surrounding the mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Internal organs of a /Holothurian/, as seen when\r\nthe body-wall is divided along the middle of the dorsal surface:\r\n/b.w./, body-wall; /circ. mus./, circular layer of muscle; /cl./,\r\ncloaca; /cl. op./, cloacal opening with five teeth; /cuv. org./,\r\nCuvierian organs; /gen. ap./, genital aperture; /gen. du./, genital\r\nduct; /gen. gl./, genital gland; /int./, intestine; /inter. oss./,\r\ninterambulacral ossicles; /int. ves./, intestinal vessels; /long.\r\nmus./, longitudinal band of muscle; /mad. can./, madreporic canals;\r\n/mes./, mesentery; /pol. ves./, Polian vesicles; /rad. amb./, radial\r\nambulacral vessel; /ri. bl. ves./, ring blood-vessel; /resp./,\r\nrespiratory trees; /ring-ves./, ring-vessel of the ambulacral system;\r\n/stom./, stomach.]\r\n\r\nThe larvæ, when free-swimming, are called /Auricula/. In the\r\ndeep-water species, /Cucumaria crocea/ and /Psolus ephippiger/, the\r\neggs, when discharged, and the young are carried on the back of the\r\nmother. In /Cucumaria lævigata/ there is a brood-pouch, while in\r\n/Synapta viviparia/ the young develop in the body-cavity.\r\n\r\nThe holothurians have the singular power of ejecting the whole of\r\ntheir internal organs and of growing them again in case they escape\r\nthe enemy they have endeavored to elude by this strange method. They\r\nalso turn themselves inside out, as it were, as if from /nausea/,\r\nwhen confined in water too stale for their uses. Often the viscera\r\nare ejected through holes in the sides of the body broken by violent\r\nmuscular contractions.\r\n\r\nHolothurians are generally distributed through all seas, but are\r\ncongregated in greatest numbers in Eastern seas. Their habitat\r\nextends from shallow to very deep water. They are found in\r\ntide-pools, on rocks, and in sand or mud. Like worms, they live on\r\norganic particles contained in mud and sand, which they take into the\r\ngullet and pass through the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =PEDATA=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Thyone^\r\n\r\n  ^T. briareus.^ This is a large purple holothurian, found in shallow\r\n  water from Texas to Cape Cod. It is four to five inches long and\r\n  one inch or more thick, purple in color, and thickly covered over\r\n  its whole surface with prominent papillæ. [pg232]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pentacta^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Pentacta frondosa/, the sea-cucumber.]\r\n\r\n  ^P. frondosa.^ This animal is commonly called the sea-cucumber,\r\n  and the popular name somewhat expresses its form, but it has the\r\n  power of changing its shape in a most surprising manner. Sometimes\r\n  it will be nearly globular, again long and thin, or it may be\r\n  constricted like an hourglass. When at rest the body is ovate and\r\n  somewhat pentagonal. On the angles are double lines of suckers, and\r\n  in the interambulacral zones are a few scattered false ambulacra.\r\n  The surface is nearly smooth, very dark purple on one side, and\r\n  inclined to whitish on the other. Ten much-branched tentacles\r\n  surround the mouth. The animal, when grown and expanded, measures\r\n  fifteen to eighteen inches in length. This species is found\r\n  throughout the whole length of both the east and the west coasts.\r\n  It is very plentiful on the Maine coast in tide-pools and on the\r\n  rocks at low-water mark. The genus ranges over the greater part of\r\n  the globe. The tough muscular body is said to be edible, tasting\r\n  somewhat like lobster, or trepang (/Holothuria edulis/), which is\r\n  found on coral reefs in Eastern seas and is much valued as food\r\n  by the Chinese. The internal organs of /P. frondosa/ are highly\r\n  colored, making its anatomy easy to trace. The muscular system is\r\n  plainly defined.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Lophothuria^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Lophothuria fabricii/, showing under surface with\r\nthree rows of ambulacra.]\r\n\r\n  ^L. fabricii^ (Verrill), ^Psolus fabricii^ (Düben), ^Cuvieria\r\n  squamata^ (D. and K.: Agassiz). The body in this species is covered\r\n  with rounded overlapping scales and numerous granulations, and\r\n  when it is retracted is about two and a half to three inches long\r\n  and about one inch thick. [pg233] Rows of tube-feet lie near\r\n  together, on a flat under surface, and form a kind of sole on which\r\n  the animal creeps. The oral end of the body is a little raised\r\n  and bears ten tentacles; these tentacles are profusely and finely\r\n  branched, and when expanded are about as long as the body. The\r\n  aboral end is obtuse and a little raised. Around the oral and anal\r\n  openings the scales are grouped, forming circles in those regions.\r\n  This holothurian is bright red in color, and when expanded is a\r\n  beautiful object, perhaps the most attractive in appearance of any\r\n  in the class. When retracted it has the aspect of an ascidian, and\r\n  for a time was supposed to belong to that group. It is found on the\r\n  New England coast on the under side of large shelving rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =APODA=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Synapta^\r\n\r\n  ^S. tenuis.^ This curious animal is long and slender, and so\r\n  transparent that its internal organs are clearly visible. Around\r\n  the mouth are a circular tube and a wreath of twelve branching\r\n  tentacles. There are no ambulacra. Little spots scattered\r\n  irregularly over the surface show, when highly magnified, small\r\n  warts, each one of which has a calcareous projection shaped like a\r\n  little anchor. By means of these anchors and by the contractions\r\n  of its body the animal moves through the mud or sand in which it\r\n  lives, near low-water mark. The sand is collected into rings at the\r\n  oral end and pushed downward until the whole animal is inclosed in\r\n  a sand-tube. When empty /Synapta/ is white and transparent, and\r\n  the digestive canal may be seen wound in a spiral throughout its\r\n  length; but when gorged with food, sand, pebbles, and shells can\r\n  be distinctly seen filling the food-canal, and the body then has a\r\n  dark-gray color. /Synapta/ grows to a length of eighteen inches or\r\n  more, but is constantly breaking pieces off its posterior end by\r\n  muscular contractions. When kept in confinement it soon commences\r\n  to constrict its body at various points, and after a few hours\r\n  there is nothing left but a mass of fragments. It is viviparous,\r\n  that is, it carries its young in the body-cavity; the eggs are\r\n  hatched, and the young approach maturity before they are expelled.\r\n  This species ranges from Cape Cod to North Carolina, and can be\r\n  found in the upper part of its burrows when the tide is out.\r\n\r\n  ^S. roseola.^ This species occurs in the same localities as /S.\r\n  tenuis/, and differs from it mainly in color, which is pale red,\r\n  due to minute red spots scattered through the skin.\r\n\r\n  ^S. rotifera.^ A species found in Florida. It is light purplish\r\n  in color, and has eight or ten branches on each of the twelve\r\n  tentacles. In this species the spicules of lime in the skin are\r\n  shaped like wheels instead of anchors.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Caudina^\r\n\r\n  ^C. arenata.^ About four inches long and tapers to the ends; the\r\n  posterior end sometimes narrowed to a long, slender, tail-like\r\n  extremity; tentacles around the mouth resemble cloves. It lives in\r\n  sand and may be found on the New England coast, washed ashore after\r\n  a storm. [pg234]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClass =CRINOIDEA=\r\n\r\nGenera ^Pentacrinus^ ^Comatula^\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS =CRINOIDEA=\r\n\r\nFEATHER-STARS AND SEA-LILIES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The feather-star (/Antedon/), illustrating the\r\n/Comatula/ form of crinoid.]\r\n\r\nThe crinoids are inhabitants of deep water, where they grow in great\r\nnumbers, forming beds of sea-lilies. Their general form, which\r\nsuggests the lily, and their feather-like manner of branching, give\r\nthem the two common names of sea-lilies and sea-feathers. They have\r\na long, jointed stalk, one end of which is attached, while the other\r\nbears the disk of the animal. From the disk emanate five arms, which\r\ndivide near the base, making [pg235] ten arms in all. The arms\r\nhave short branches along the sides. Ambulacral grooves follow the\r\ncenter of all the arms and branches. The mouth is in the center of\r\nthe upper side, which in this case is the ventral surface. The genus\r\n^Pentacrinus^ remains permanently attached, but ^Comatula^, at a\r\ncertain stage of development, separates from the stalk and swims\r\nfreely about by means of its arms. It can attach itself temporarily\r\nby tubular processes, which are developed on the dorsal surface at\r\nthe point where the stem was attached. The ossicles, or plates which\r\ncover the dorsal surface, are free, making the crinoid an animal of\r\ninnumerable joints.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Pentacrinus asteria./]\r\n\r\nThe crinoids are particularly interesting from the fact that they\r\nhave existed from early geologic times, and their history is written\r\nin stone. In the early ages they were the only class of echinoderms,\r\nand their evolution into other forms can be traced through successive\r\ngeologic periods. They existed in such vast numbers that the fossil\r\nforms are plentiful and are familiar to every student of geology, and\r\nare known as stone-lilies and encrinites. To-day they are decadent,\r\nthere now remaining only twelve of the two hundred genera which\r\nexisted formerly. A fine bed of crinoids is found off Cuba, on the\r\nslope of the coast where the water rapidly deepens from one hundred\r\nto two hundred fathoms. [pg236]\r\n\r\nAlthough the crinoids are deep-water forms, and are never found on\r\nthe beach, they are given here because they follow in the system of\r\nclassification and illustrate another curious class of echinoderms.\r\nThe brief description given may add interest to the fossil forms to\r\nbe seen in museums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nARTHROPODA\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE ARTHROPODS DESCRIBED IN THIS\r\nCHAPTER\r\n\r\n    Phylum =ARTHROPODA=\r\n\r\n      Class =CRUSTACEA=\r\n\r\n        Subclass =Entomostraca= (/Crustacea of small, often of almost\r\n          microscopic minuteness, and of comparatively simple\r\n          organization; appendages have little differentiation/)\r\n\r\n          Order =PHYLLOPODA= (/Appendages resemble leaves; mostly\r\n            fresh-water species/)\r\n\r\n            Suborder ~EUPHYLLOPODA~   (/Phyllopoda of considerable\r\n              size, bearing ten to sixty pairs of leaf-like\r\n              swimming-feet/)\r\n\r\n            Suborder ~CLADOCERA~   (/Small phyllopoda; body laterally\r\n              compressed; carapace like a bivalve shell; four to five\r\n              pairs of swimming-feet; chief organs of locomotion are\r\n              the biramous antennæ; abdomen devoid of appendages.

Although these animals are so\r\nunlike in general appearance, it is easy to recognize the common\r\ncharacteristics which place them together in one group. The name\r\n/Arthropoda/, meaning \"jointed-footed,\" suggests perhaps one of the\r\nmost obvious points of resemblance. The /Arthropoda/ have bilateral\r\nsymmetry, one side of the body being like the other; they are covered\r\nwith a horn-like material (chitin); they are divided into segments;\r\nthe segments have appendages; and the appendages are jointed so as\r\nto admit freedom of motion. Their manner of growth is peculiar; they\r\ncast off their rigid external coverings and secrete larger coats of\r\nmail, and at these periods increase in size or undergo metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nThere are such modifications of these general features as the habits\r\nof the different species demand. For instance, the appendages may be\r\nconstructed for walking, swimming, boring, sucking, or the seizure\r\nand preparation of food. In some animals the appendages form a part\r\nof the breathing-organs, in others are used as organs of sense. Every\r\ndetail of the organism, down to the hairs, has its special use and\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS =CRUSTACEA=\r\n\r\nThe crustaceans vary in size from microscopic minuteness to two feet\r\nor more in length. The giant crab of Japan (/Kaempferia kaempferi/)\r\nexceeds this, being commonly from eight to twelve feet [pg245]\r\nacross the arms, and is said to reach even greater proportions.\r\nCrustaceans live on land and sea, and in both fresh and salt water;\r\nthey may be parasitic, sedentary, or free and active. There are said\r\nto be over ten thousand species, which include crabs, lobsters,\r\nshrimps, beach-fleas, wood-lice, barnacles, and water-fleas. Nine\r\ntenths of the species are marine; of these some are pelagic, and\r\ntheir transparent forms constitute a part of the plankton. Others\r\nlive on the bottom in deep water and attain a large size. A vast\r\nnumber live in the littoral zone and form a considerable part of that\r\ncrowded community. They are scavengers and freebooters, being great\r\nfighters, as well as predatory in their habits. As a rule, they feed\r\non dead organic matter, which they consume in surprising quantities;\r\nsome have also a vegetarian diet. They have, like starfishes, the\r\nsingular power of throwing off their limbs and growing new ones.\r\n\r\nThe /Crustacea/ derive their name from the nature of their crust or\r\ncovering. This is earthy and brittle, not stony, like the shells\r\nof mollusks. This crust, or exoskeleton, has various degrees of\r\nfirmness, from that of a delicate polished cuticle, seen in small\r\nforms, to the heavy armor of some crabs and the shell-like character\r\nof the covering of barnacles.\r\n\r\nThe lobster and crab are perhaps the most comprehensive examples as\r\nwell as the largest in size of the class, the vast majority of the\r\nspecies being minute forms. The ocean swarms with varieties too small\r\nto be noticeable to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nIt is the province of /Crustacea/ to consume decaying organic matter,\r\nboth animal and vegetable, and in doing this they perform a great\r\nservice in purifying the waters of the pool, the shore, and even the\r\nsea. Not only in this are they serviceable, but to a great extent\r\nthey serve as food for other animals, their flesh being palatable\r\nand preferred to that of other animals whose diet would seem to make\r\nthem more wholesome. The small forms exist in such myriads, and\r\nincrease so rapidly, that, although extremely small, they furnish an\r\ninexhaustible supply of food. Even some whales subsist upon these\r\nminute animals, and for man the larger species are articles of diet\r\nthat are counted among the luxuries. The crustaceans are remarkable\r\nfor their varied forms and for their [pg246] perfect adaptation to\r\nmany different conditions of life. There is no class in the animal\r\nkingdom which presents so wide a range of organization, or whose\r\nstructure deviates so widely from the type form. These differences\r\nlie chiefly in the external characters and in the structure of the\r\nappendages.\r\n\r\nSome species are solitary, like lobsters and crabs; others, like\r\nshrimps, are gregarious and live in immense shoals. In the habits of\r\nthese animals there is much which excites wonder and interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMY OF THE HIGHER CRUSTACEA\r\n\r\nThe body of a crustacean is divided into segments, which are\r\nsometimes distinctly separated, like joints, and sometimes fused\r\ninto one piece. The head part is called the /cephalic/ portion,\r\nthe middle section is the /thorax/, and the posterior part is the\r\n/abdomen/. The horn-like covering of the thorax is the /carapace/;\r\nwhere it projects over the head it is the /rostrum/. When the head\r\nand thorax are united, as in most /Crustacea/, the anterior or front\r\nportion of the animal is called the /cephalothorax/. Each segment\r\nhas a pair of appendages. Each appendage has a joint attached to the\r\nbody; from this arise two jointed branches, the /endopodite/ and\r\nthe /exopodite/, the inner and the outer foot. The appendages are\r\nmodified to perform special functions. In front of the mouth are two\r\npairs: the smaller ones are the /antennules/ and have ears at the\r\nbase; the larger ones are /antennæ/ and are feelers. At the base of\r\nthe antennæ are the /green glands/, said to have renal functions.\r\nBoth the antennules and the antennæ are fringed with hairs, which aid\r\nin the sense of touch and perhaps of smell. On each side of the mouth\r\nare the /mandibles/. Then come the /maxillæ/ and the /maxillipeds/,\r\nused in capturing and tearing the food and conveying it to the mouth.\r\nThus it will be seen that some of the appendages around the head\r\nare connected with the senses, and others are used in eating. Those\r\nof the thorax are for walking; those of the abdomen for swimming,\r\nguarding the eggs, etc. The food taken into the mouth passes into\r\nthe stomach through a short passage. The stomach is divided into two\r\nparts. The front [pg247] one contains three long teeth which meet\r\nlaterally and grind the food; this is known as the /gastric mill/.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficiently fine, the food passes through a strainer of stiff\r\nbristles into the smaller portion of the stomach, where it is\r\npartially digested, and from there enters a long, straight intestine\r\nwhich reaches the length of the body and opens to the outside on\r\nthe under side of the /telson/, or last segment. A large liver also\r\npours its secretions into the intestine. The green substance commonly\r\ncalled \"fat\" in lobsters is the liver.\r\n\r\nThe heart consists of an elongated tube, or a short sac, which lies\r\ndirectly under the integument of the back. From this heart-sac,\r\nblood, which is colorless, is sent by arteries to all parts of the\r\nbody; it then collects in spaces called /venous sinuses/, from which\r\nit goes to the gills, and thence back to the heart.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system begins in a large ganglion in front of the mouth,\r\ncalled the brain; from this two branches arise, which pass on each\r\nside of the digestive organs, meeting in ganglia in each segment\r\nand extending the whole length of the body. The gills, by which the\r\nanimal breathes, are upon the limbs, or on the walls of the body\r\nimmediately adjacent to them, and are generally inclosed in special\r\nchambers. In lobsters and crabs two such chambers are found under\r\nthe flaps of the carapace, above the walking-legs. Gills are divided\r\nso as to present much surface to the water, from which they absorb\r\noxygen. They are like a dense mass of little tubes arranged along a\r\ncentral tube. The class has two kinds of eyes, simple and compound;\r\nthe latter are composed of a number of eyes. In some species the eyes\r\nare placed on the ends of movable stalks, which enable the creature\r\nto see in all directions and from a higher plane than the body\r\noccupies. As a rule, the eyes occur in the head region, but in the\r\nshrimp /Euphausia/ they are on the thorax and abdomen. In barnacles\r\nsimple eyes exist in the young stage, but in adult forms there are\r\nno apparent visual organs. The ear (so called) consists of a sac\r\ncontaining small silicious particles suspended in fluid. Numerous\r\nfine hairs on the inner surface of the sac connect with nerve-fibrils.\r\n\r\nThe organs of hearing are in various places. In decapods, or the\r\nlarger /Crustacea/, they are at the base of the antennules. [pg248]\r\n\r\nThe muscles are white bundles of fibers, and are in strips, which is\r\nan indication of power and activity. There are four important sets:\r\ntwisted ventral muscles which bend the tail and are particularly\r\nlarge and strong, those which straighten the tail, those moving the\r\nappendages, and those which work the gastric mill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Zoëa of /Cancer irroratus/. Last stage before it\r\nchanges to the megalops condition.]\r\n\r\nThe eggs, after being discharged, are attached to the abdominal legs\r\nof the mother by a kind of cement, or they are carried in pouches\r\nattached to the thorax. In these positions they mature, and hatch at\r\ndifferent stages of development in different species. Some emerge\r\nwith three pairs of legs, and are known as /Nauplius/; some are\r\n/Zoëa/, having a carapace and abdominal segments, but no abdominal\r\nappendages. Another stage is /Megalops/, with large stalked eyes.\r\nOthers are hatched as miniature adults. These names were given when\r\nthe embryo stage was not recognized and the larvæ were thought to be\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Megalops stage of /Cancer irroratus/, just after\r\nchange from zoëa stage.]\r\n\r\nThe growth of the animal is effected by moulting. The /Crustacea/\r\nare named from the crust-like covering which envelops them. It is\r\na horny material, called chitin, in which are deposited particles\r\nof carbonate of lime, making a rigid envelop which would prevent\r\nall freedom of motion, were it not that there are spaces free from\r\nlime, and thus flexible joints are left. When the animal expands it\r\nthrows off this hard covering and secretes a new and larger one. As\r\nthe time of moulting approaches, the old covering becomes loosened,\r\nand a delicate new one is formed beneath it. The old shell splits\r\nopen across the back just behind the carapace, and the soft animal\r\nwithdraws first its cephalothorax and then its abdomen, leaving the\r\ncover complete, including even the covering of the eyes and the\r\nlining of the stomach. The [pg249] new shell is rapidly hardened,\r\nbeing already formed when the old one is cast, and the animal\r\nregains its normal condition in about a week; in the meantime it\r\nis defenseless, and lies quiet in some secluded place. Moulting is\r\nan exhausting process, and is attended with great dangers. A great\r\nmortality occurs at this time from accidents, from weakness, and also\r\nfrom helplessness in case of attack.\r\n\r\nThe hair-like processes scattered over the shell, often like fringes,\r\nare said to be organs of feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCLASS =ENTOMOSTRACA=\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are /Crustacea/ of small, often microscopic size, of\r\ncomparatively simple organization, and with appendages adapted\r\nto serve the purpose of respiration. These minute animals may be\r\nobtained by skimming the surface of the water with a muslin net,\r\npreferably at night, then washing off the inside of the net with a\r\nsmall quantity of water into a glass dish. Place the dish on a dark\r\nsurface before a light, and the little creatures will gather toward\r\nthe light, and may be satisfactorily observed with a glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =COPEPODA=\r\n\r\nThis order, though composed of minute forms, is one of great economic\r\nimportance, from the fact that the little crustaceans exist in\r\nvast numbers and furnish a very considerable part of the food of\r\nmany fishes. ^Cyclops^ is the most common of the fresh-water, and\r\n^Cetochilus^ of the marine genera. These, together with other genera,\r\nswarm in water wherever life exists, from the smallest pools and\r\nditches to the broad surface of the ocean. Without having drawn\r\na surface-net on some sheltered bay, it is difficult to have an\r\nidea of the myriads of /Entomostraca/ in the sea. Although nearly\r\ntransparent and of such delicate texture as to be almost jelly-like,\r\nthey sometimes color the sea with a reddish tint for miles. Whales\r\nwhich have baleen, or fringes of whalebone, in the mouth subsist\r\non these small organisms, which are called \"brit\" by the whalemen.\r\nThe whales, sometimes in schools, rush through the water with open\r\nmouths, engulfing these little [pg250] crustaceans, the baleen\r\nstraining them from the water. Although devoured in such immense\r\nquantities, and sometimes lying dead in sheets of scum on the surface\r\nof the water, they maintain their numbers by the exceeding rapidity\r\nwith which they reproduce. It has been computed that the descendants\r\nof one /Cyclops/ may number in one year 4,500,000,000, provided all\r\nthe young reach maturity and produce a full number of offspring.\r\n\r\nOne of the free marine forms, ^Sapphirina^, is of especial interest,\r\nas it surpasses all animals in phosphorescence and sparkles by day as\r\nwell as by night. It is one quarter of an inch long, and is broad and\r\nflat.\r\n\r\nBesides the myriads of free-swimming copepods, there are parasitic\r\nforms in great number. The marine parasitic forms are commonly known\r\nas fish-lice. They have various habits, some living as commensals,\r\nothers attaching themselves to animals only to be carried about; the\r\ntrue parasites live upon the blood and tissues of their hosts, and\r\nmay fasten themselves to the external parts of the body or to the\r\ninternal organs. Whales, fishes of all kinds, mollusks, starfishes,\r\njellyfishes, and corals, all have some form of parasite, and many\r\nhave several different kinds of guests. It is said that the haddock\r\nhas more than a dozen which infest its external and internal\r\nmembranes.\r\n\r\n^Nicothoë^ is found on the gills of lobsters. The truly parasitic\r\nforms are usually very degenerate and lose the characteristics of\r\ntheir order.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =CIRRIPEDIA=\r\n\r\n(\"/Curled feet/\")\r\n\r\nTHE BARNACLES\r\n\r\nBarnacles of the genus /Balanus/ (acorn-shells) (Plate LIX.) are\r\nfamiliar objects on rocky shores, which they often whiten with their\r\nshells, and those of the genus /Lepas/ are also widely known. The\r\nname of the order is descriptive of their curled appendages. The\r\nappendages are fringed like feathers and are drawn into or protruded\r\nfrom the shell at will. When extended they are constantly in motion,\r\nand create currents which carry food to the [pg251] mouth of the\r\nanimal, which is dependent upon such food as comes within range of\r\nits tentacles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Balanus./ A, external view: /s/, scutum; /t/, tergum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Balanus./ B, anatomy: /a/, antennules; /ad/, adductor\r\nmuscle; /m/, muscles of scuta and terga; /o/, edge of parapet; /ov/,\r\novary; /ovi/, oviduct; /sc/, scutum; /sk/, parapet; /t/, tergum;\r\n/wo/, female aperture.]\r\n\r\nTheir life-history is interesting. The young barnacle, called a\r\n/nauplius/, in no way resembles the adult. When it emerges from the\r\negg it is a free and independent animal, with one eye, three pairs\r\nof legs, and a single shell. It swims about for a while and moults\r\nseveral times. It then has two eyes, two shells, and six pairs of\r\nlegs. At this period it seeks a permanent home, and attaches its\r\nanterior end to the object it selects by means of its antennæ,\r\nwhich have become suckers. It makes its hold secure by secreting a\r\ncement which permanently fastens it to the spot. It then undergoes\r\nmetamorphosis, loses its bivalve shell and its eyes, and attains its\r\ncharacteristic /cirripeds/, or curled feathery legs, and a new shell\r\ncovering. During these transformations, from the time it becomes\r\nfixed until it attains its adult form, the barnacle fasts, living by\r\nthe absorption of its own animal fat. Its food subsequently consists\r\nof the minute animal forms which abound in the sea. Its further\r\ngrowth is by moulting, but parts only of its covering are disengaged;\r\nthe shell is permanent, and its successive stages of growth are\r\nmarked upon it by lines, as in mollusks. The lining of the shell, or\r\nenveloping skin of the animal, and also the cuticle of the legs are\r\n[pg252] shed, and in the spring of the year these thin, glossy casts\r\nare found in abundance floating on the surface of the water near the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nThere are but three orders of barnacles, namely, those in which the\r\nshell is directly attached to the rocks, those which are attached to\r\nfloating objects by a long stalk, and those which are parasitic on\r\nanimals. A species of the third order infests the whale.\r\n\r\nThe older zoölogists classed barnacles with the /Mollusca/, but in\r\n1829 Vaughan Thompson, in the study of their embryology, found that\r\nthey should be classed with crustaceans, in company with crabs,\r\nshrimps, and water-fleas, with which their immature forms show direct\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Lepas^\r\n\r\nThis genus is commonly known as the ship-barnacle, also as the\r\ngoose-barnacle. It attaches itself to floating logs as well as to\r\nships, but the latter form its principal home; consequently it\r\nis a great voyager, and, though common everywhere, is everywhere\r\nconsidered a stranger. The same species are found on ships coming\r\nfrom the most remote and widely separated regions, and so they cannot\r\nbe considered native to any one locality. They are wanderers on the\r\ndeep, and grow in such numbers on the bottoms of ships, especially\r\nof those which sail in warm seas, that they seriously impede the\r\nprogress of the vessels. Aside from diminishing its speed, they do a\r\nship no injury.\r\n\r\nThere was a tradition, which lasted several centuries, that geese\r\nwere hatched from these shells, which somewhat resemble eggs. Gerard,\r\nin the appendix to his \"Herball or Generale Historie of Plants\"\r\n(1597), gives a picture of shells of /Lepas/ growing on a tree, with\r\ngeese falling from them and swimming about in the water below. His\r\ndescription is as follows: \"There are founde in the North parts of\r\nScotland and the islands adjacent called Orchades certaine trees\r\nwhereon do growe certaine shell fishes of a white color, tending to\r\nrusset, wherein are conteined little living creatures; which shells\r\nin time of maturitie do open, and out of them grow those little\r\nliving foules whom we call barnakles, in the North of England brant\r\ngeise, and in Lancashire tree geise; but [pg253] the other that do\r\nfall upon the land do perish and come to nothing.\" He then describes\r\nin detail the various transformations, and ends with: \"But what our\r\neies have seen and hands have touched we shall declare.\"\r\n\r\nThe long, flexible stalk of /Lepas/ is its anterior end. Generally\r\nthis stalk is only half an inch long, but in some species it attains\r\nthe length of a foot.\r\n\r\nHuxley describes the barnacle as a crustacean fixed by its head and\r\nkicking food into its mouth with its legs. The mouth has a pair of\r\nsmall mandibles and two pairs of maxillæ, the last pair uniting to\r\nform a lower lip. The thorax has six pairs of branched appendages.\r\nThe body is enveloped in a fold of skin, to which are attached five\r\nshell-like plates. One of these plates is long and narrow, and\r\nextends along the dorsal side; two are large and triangular (the\r\nterga); two are small and triangular (the scuta), the long point\r\nextending downward. These shells are on the free or posterior end.\r\n\r\nBarnacles have a nervous system, consisting of a brain and a chain\r\nof five or more ganglia, but no special respiratory or circulatory\r\norgans are known; the cirripeds, or feet, are supposed to perform\r\nthese functions. They have also a food-canal, a digestive gland, and\r\nexcretory tubes. The eggs are carried under the external fold of the\r\nskin in flat cakes.\r\n\r\n  ^L. anatifera.^ The shell is bluish-white, showing lines of growth\r\n  and faint radiating lines emanating from the anterior basal angle.\r\n  The upper valves are narrow; the long tips point downward, and\r\n  the top is blunted, leaving a space which is occupied only by a\r\n  membrane. Near the apex of the shell, at the back, is a distinct\r\n  angle. The dorsal valve is broad, not much compressed, and is\r\n  sometimes grooved lengthwise. The cartilage of the shell and\r\n  the stalk adjoining the shell are orange-colored. The stalk is\r\n  grayish-brown and the cirri flesh-colored. The stalk is from one\r\n  inch to six inches long. The shell is one inch long.\r\n\r\n  ^L. striata.^ Shells bluish-white; valves sharply triangular;\r\n  dorsal valve compressed, forming a ridge; lines radiate from the\r\n  basal angle of the lower valves and from the upper angle of the\r\n  terminal valves, starting from the extreme end; the margins have a\r\n  narrow edge of yellow cartilage; the stalk and cirri are of a dark\r\n  slate-color; shell and stalk are each about an inch long.\r\n\r\n  ^L. pectinata.^ Shell shorter and less compressed than in the\r\n  preceding species; lines of growth and radiating lines distinct; a\r\n  decided line [pg254] runs from anterior base to summit, a little\r\n  back of the margin; terminal end broadly obtuse (truncated); dorsal\r\n  valve much compressed, forming a sharp edge serrated with ten to\r\n  twelve teeth and distinctly striated or furrowed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Lepas anatifera./ A, the entire animal; B, anatomy.\r\n/a/, antennule; /c/, carina; /cd/, cement-gland; /l/, digestive\r\ngland; /m/, adductor muscle; /od/, oviduct; /ov/, ovary; /p/,\r\npeduncle; /s/, scutum; /t/, tergum and testis; /vd/, vas deferens;\r\n/h/, tentacles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LIX. Different forms of Balanus. (After Darwin.)\r\nCenobita diogenes.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Balanus^\r\n\r\n/Balanus/ is known as the \"acorn-shell,\" or \"sea-acorn,\" and is found\r\nin vast numbers and of all sizes between tide-marks, incrusting rocks\r\nand the piles of piers. It also may be found attached to floating\r\nobjects or to shells, or even to living animals, but its usual\r\nhabitat is stationary. Unlike /Lepas/, it has no stalk, the shell\r\nbeing directly attached to some object. The body is surrounded by a\r\nfold of skin, to which are attached a shell consisting of six or more\r\nplates and a fourfold lid, or /operculum/, consisting of two /scuta/\r\nand two /terga/. The operculum may be called the door, as the animal\r\nopens and shuts it at will and has complete protection when it is\r\nclosed. If one taps a rock [pg255] incrusted with barnacles, and\r\nholds the ear near, the closing of the many doors may be distinctly\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nThe development of /Balanus/ from the larval stage, as also the\r\nanatomy of the adult, is similar to that of /Lepas/. When covered\r\nwith water and unmolested, there may be seen over a bed of barnacles\r\nthousands of tiny fringed feet waving to and fro. The motions look\r\nlike gestures; they are perfectly regular and rapid, numbering\r\neighty to a hundred a minute. The shell covering formed by barnacles\r\non piles of wharves and bridges is said to be a protective agent;\r\notherwise the barnacles seem to have no economic value in nature,\r\nas, unlike other animals, they do not serve, except in very small\r\nmeasure, as food to other classes. The tautog and perhaps some other\r\nfishes feed partly upon them. They are sometimes an obstacle to\r\noyster-culture, as they fasten upon the objects intended for oyster\r\nembryos, and, growing faster than the latter, soon crowd them off.\r\nOne species, /Coronula diadema/, fastens to the skin of whales. It\r\nattains the size of two inches in diameter. The shell is half an\r\ninch thick and full of cavities, into which the skin of the whale is\r\ndrawn, giving the barnacle a secure hold. (Plate LIX.)\r\n\r\n  ^B. balanoides^ (Stimp.), ^B. ovularis^ (Gould), the rock-barnacle.\r\n  This is perhaps the most conspicuous of the barnacles. It inhabits\r\n  the whole northern Atlantic coast, and is so abundant that it not\r\n  only whitens the rocks with a complete incrustation of shells, but\r\n  the animals are so crowded that many of them lose their normal\r\n  shapes and become greatly elongated. When the rocks are covered\r\n  with water they seem alive, on account of the thousands of waving\r\n  tentacles. This species also incrusts woodwork between tide-marks.\r\n\r\n  The shell is small, white, and variable in shape; sometimes its\r\n  height is less than the diameter of its base; again the height is\r\n  several times greater and the summit broader than the base. In its\r\n  early stages the valves are smooth, but later the base is scalloped\r\n  by four or five grooves. The summit of the plates is even and\r\n  blunt. The aperture is diamond-shaped. Two valves of the operculum\r\n  are pointed at the tips; two are blunt, making a deep notch in\r\n  the summit. These valves are the distinctive feature by which to\r\n  recognize this species, which varies so much in outward form; the\r\n  species is also distinguished by its membranous base, which does\r\n  not form a solid plate like that of other species.\r\n\r\n  ^B. eburneus^, the ivory barnacle. This species, like /B.\r\n  balanoides/, is a very common barnacle, and is found on all kinds\r\n  of submerged woodwork, whether fixed or floating. It is also found\r\n  on the carapace of [pg256] crabs and /Limulus/, and on mollusks.\r\n  It is chiefly found on objects below low-water mark. It ranges\r\n  from Massachusetts Bay to Florida. It is easily distinguished from\r\n  the preceding by its low, broad form and shelly base. The shell is\r\n  smooth and circular at the base, and inclines backward, forming an\r\n  oblique cone with a triangular opening; the plates terminate in\r\n  points at the summit and incline backward, the last one forming a\r\n  kind of beak. The operculum is pyramidal; two of its valves have\r\n  both transverse and longitudinal lines well defined at the base,\r\n  and are coarsely toothed at the edges; the posterior valves are\r\n  slightly grooved across.\r\n\r\n  ^B. rugosus^ (Gould), ^B. crenatus^. Shell white, cylindrical,\r\n  somewhat conical, rugged, the summit usually as broad as the base;\r\n  height often greater than diameter; aperture diamond-shaped, plates\r\n  ending at the summit in acute spreading points, the posterior plate\r\n  folded and curved like a beak; plates rough, with coarse, irregular\r\n  ribs; valves of the operculum at the summit acute, with diverging\r\n  points; the points striated. Found on shells and stones in deep\r\n  water and also on bottoms of ships.\r\n\r\n  ^B. geniculatus.^ Shell dirty greenish-white, cone-shaped; aperture\r\n  about the size of base; shell-plates triangular, unequal in\r\n  breadth, and with alternate large and small ribs; the smaller ribs\r\n  compressed and roughened on the edges by the conspicuous lines of\r\n  growth which run across them; depressed areas between the plates\r\n  marked with fine cross-lines; front valves of the operculum have\r\n  coarse plated ridges, which incline over one another and are\r\n  crossed by fine radiating lines; diameter at base one to one and\r\n  a half inches; height two thirds the diameter. Found on pecten\r\n  shells, and abundant off the coast of Maine.\r\n\r\n  ^B. tintinnabulum.^ Shell pink to purplish, conical, with six\r\n  triangular plates, which are grooved, forming unequal ribs, and\r\n  crossed by distinct lines of growth; spaces between plates crossed\r\n  by lateral lines; posterior valves of the operculum longer than the\r\n  others and curved forward, resembling the beak of a bird of prey;\r\n  diameter at the base one inch; height one and a half inches. Found\r\n  in warm waters and on vessels from the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ~RHIZOCEPHALA~\r\n\r\nThese are parasitic forms and very degenerate. ^Sacculina^ lives on\r\ncrabs, and its term of life is about three years, during which period\r\nthe afflicted crab does not moult. Its shape is that of an ovoid sac\r\non a stalk, which it attaches between two segments of the ventral\r\nsurface of its host. The stalk divides and ramifies in a root-like\r\nmanner within the body of the crab, from whose vital elements it\r\nabsorbs its nourishment. The roots spread like a mycelium through the\r\nwhole crab, even to the claws.\r\n\r\n^Peltogaster^ lives on hermit-crabs. [pg257]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCLASS =MALACOSTRACA=\r\n\r\nThis subclass comprises highly organized /Crustacea/, usually of\r\nconsiderable size, having the appendages much differentiated, the\r\nthorax with eight segments, and the abdomen with seven segments.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =SCHIZOPODA=\r\n\r\nThe name, meaning \"cleft-footed,\" applies to the appendages of the\r\nthorax, which are once-branched (/biramous/). Gills, when present,\r\nare attached to these feet, and hang freely in the water. A delicate\r\ncarapace covers the thorax; the abdomen is proportionately very\r\nlarge, often twice the length of the cephalothorax. In /Mysis/ the\r\neggs are carried in pouches under the thorax, giving the common\r\nname of \"opossum-shrimp\" to this small, transparent, phosphorescent\r\ncrustacean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Mysis sternolepis./]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Mysis^\r\n\r\n  ^M. sternolepis.^ About one inch in length; translucent; antennæ\r\n  very long; segments marked at joints with dark spots; the last two\r\n  segments terminate in a stout spine; telson longer than the sixth\r\n  segment; the sides are nearly straight and are armed with spines;\r\n  the extremity is cleft; eyes large and prominent. Found abundantly\r\n  in winter on the shores of still, muddy bays and sounds, especially\r\n  among eel-grass.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =DECAPODA=\r\n\r\n(\"/Ten-footed/\")\r\n\r\nThe /Decapoda/ are named from their ten walking-legs. The higher\r\nforms of crustaceans belong to this order. All the /Decapoda/\r\nhave a similar anatomy, but are placed in two subdivisions\r\n[pg258] according to their external form. In /Macrura/, the first\r\nsubdivision, belong the lobsters, crawfish, shrimps, prawns, and\r\nhermit-crabs, animals having a long and more or less cylindrical\r\nbody, with the abdomen extended; in /Brachyura/, the second\r\nsubdivision, are placed the crabs, animals having the thorax broad\r\nand flat, and the abdomen bent under the thorax. The /Decapoda/\r\nhave twenty segments, all of which, except the last one, have, at\r\nsome period of life, a pair of appendages. The first two pairs of\r\nappendages, or, in the stalk-eyed forms, the first three pairs,\r\nare especially connected with the senses, and are often fringed\r\nwith hairs, which are also considered to have a sense-function. The\r\n/antennules/, or first pair of appendages after the eye-stalks, are\r\nsometimes divided into two or three branches. At the base of the\r\nantennules are the ears. The /antennæ/, or second pair of appendages,\r\nare undivided, but are larger than the first pair, and are often\r\nvery long. At the base of the antennæ are the renal glands. Both\r\nthe antennules and the antennæ are slender, elongated, movable, and\r\nfull of joints. In some species they are greatly modified, as in\r\n/Scyllarus/, where they are developed into broad swimming-plates and,\r\nperhaps, as shovels for burrowing; in some amphipods they are used as\r\nswimming-organs. (Plate LX.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LX.

They\r\nare the /mandibles/, the /maxillæ/, and the /maxillipeds/. The\r\nmandibles are at the mouth-opening, and, being heavy and hard, are\r\nadapted to tearing and grinding; they have a jointed attachment,\r\nthe /palpus/, whose office is to keep the mandibles clean. The two\r\npairs of maxillæ are delicate and leaf-like. The three pairs of\r\nmaxillipeds grow gradually larger, the last pair being very prominent\r\nand extending over the other mouth-parts. Next come five pairs of\r\nwalking-feet. One or more pairs of these feet have pincer-like ends,\r\nor claws. Some species have the claws immensely developed, as in\r\nlobsters. The claws are the /chelæ/, and the feet which bear the\r\n/chelæ/ are termed the /chelipeds/. The rest of the walking-feet\r\nhave generally single, hook-like ends, but are variously modified\r\nin different species. The abdominal segments have six pairs of\r\nappendages, also variously modified. The last segment is without\r\nappendages, but often is extended into a tail, [pg259] or\r\nfin-like expansion. The next to the last segment, in many forms, has\r\nappendages modified into swimming-plates, which extend on each side\r\nof the telson, forming a broad, fan-like caudal extremity.\r\n\r\nThey have, then, to correspond to the twenty segments of the body,\r\ntwo pairs of sensory, six pairs of mouth-, and five pairs of\r\nwalking-appendages attached to the cephalothorax, and six pairs on\r\nthe abdomen. The terminal segment, or telson, is without appendages.\r\nThe exopodite is present on the maxillipeds, but disappears from the\r\nwalking-feet in the higher forms.\r\n\r\nIn moulting the /Macrura/ split in the longitudinal line down the\r\nback; in the /Brachyura/ the split occurs across the body at the\r\npoint between the thorax and the abdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ~MACRURA~\r\n\r\nSHRIMPS, PRAWNS, LOBSTERS, CRAWFISH, AND HERMIT-CRABS\r\n\r\nThe characteristic features of the /Macrura/ are an elongated body\r\nwith the abdomen usually extended; a carapace, somewhat cylindrical;\r\nand the last pair of appendages of the abdomen (which are attached to\r\nthe next to last segment) united with the last segment, or telson, to\r\nform a powerful caudal fin, used for swimming backward. The creeping\r\nforms in moving walk forward, but swim backward.\r\n\r\nFREE-SWIMMING FORMS: SHRIMPS AND PRAWNS\r\n\r\nIn these animals the body is compressed and the carapace is not hard.\r\nThe abdomen is very large in proportion to the cephalothorax, and has\r\na peculiar bend. The rostrum is often longer than the thorax. The\r\neye-stalks, antennæ, and legs sometimes attain extraordinary length,\r\nand the chelæ (claws) are not always on the first pair of legs. In\r\nsome species chelæ are on two or three pairs of the legs. Above the\r\nantennæ are expanded antennal scales, which, together with the long\r\nbases of the antennules and very prominent eye-stalks, make the head\r\na broad and conspicuous feature. The difference between shrimps and\r\nprawns is not very well defined, the small individuals seeming to\r\nbe generally called shrimps, the larger full-grown ones prawns.\r\n[pg260] Prawns are known as /crevettes/ in France and as /Garnelen/\r\nin Germany, where they are largely used as food. In the United States\r\nthe shrimp-fishery is an industry of the South. On the California\r\ncoast the fisheries are very extensive and are monopolized by the\r\nChinese.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Penæus^\r\n\r\n  ^P. setiferus.^ This species is about six inches in length when\r\n  full-grown. A ridge or crest extends along the center of the\r\n  carapace, and terminates in a long, pointed, toothed rostrum,\r\n  the teeth being fringed with hair on the inner side. The antennæ\r\n  are a foot or more in length; there are chelæ on the first three\r\n  pairs of thoracic feet; the swimming-feet and lateral margins of\r\n  the segments of the abdomen are fringed with hair; and the caudal\r\n  appendages are longer than the telson. It ranges from Virginia\r\n  southward, and is very abundant on the shores of the Southern\r\n  States, where it is gathered for the markets. The large ones are\r\n  known as prawns and the small ones as shrimps.\r\n\r\n  ^P. brasiliensis.^ This species is associated with /P. setiferus/,\r\n  and, although not so abundant, forms a part of the shrimp-supply\r\n  in the fisheries. It differs from the former in having a groove\r\n  on each side of the ridge which runs through the center and whole\r\n  length of the carapace. The first three pairs of feet are chelated.\r\n  This shrimp is found as far north as Long Island, and often in\r\n  brackish water, or even where the water is quite fresh.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS =Palæmonetes=\r\n\r\n  ^P. vulgaris (Palæmon vulgaris).^ Average size one half of an inch\r\n  in length; body translucent, almost colorless, irregularly spotted;\r\n  rostrum as long as carapace and toothed on the upper edge. It is\r\n  found among eel-grass in brackish water, and also in pools and\r\n  ditches on muddy shores from Massachusetts Bay to Florida. Commonly\r\n  known as prawns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Palæmonetes vulgaris/; male.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Crangon^\r\n\r\n  ^C. vulgaris^, the common sand-shrimp. It ranges from Labrador to\r\n  North Carolina on the Atlantic coast and from Alaska to southern\r\n  California on the Pacific coast. It is found in abundance on sandy\r\n  shores at low-water mark, and in shallow water below tide-mark;\r\n  also among rocks and seaweeds. When left by the tide it buries\r\n  itself in the sand. Its color varies with its location, rendering\r\n  it inconspicuous. Upon the [pg261] sandy shores it is translucent,\r\n  pale in color, and often specked, closely resembling the sand,\r\n  while on dark, muddy bottoms it is much darker. This is an edible\r\n  shrimp, eagerly devoured by fishes; it is also gathered for the\r\n  markets. The body of /C. vulgaris/ is broad at the anterior end\r\n  and tapers to a sharp point at the posterior extremity. A pair of\r\n  broad, divided appendages on the cylindrical segment, which is next\r\n  to the last on the abdomen, together with the sharp telson, form a\r\n  fan-like swimming-tail. As in all shrimps, the antennæ are long and\r\n  have plate-like antennal scales at the base, which are fringed with\r\n  hairs. The mandibles are long. The movable finger of the chela is\r\n  folded across the extremity of the claw.\r\n\r\n  ^C. franciscorum^, the California shrimp. This species is about\r\n  three inches in length. It is distinguished from /C. vulgaris/ by\r\n  its larger size and by the greater length of the movable finger of\r\n  the chela, which folds parallel to the side of the claw instead of\r\n  across its extremity. Its color is light or dark yellowish-gray,\r\n  mottled. This is the shrimp extensively gathered by the Chinese for\r\n  commercial purposes. The shrimp-meat is dried and cured, and then\r\n  separated by blowers very much as wheat is cleaned. It is exported\r\n  to Eastern countries in great quantities, the value of the export\r\n  being estimated at one hundred thousand dollars per annum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Crangon vulgaris/, the common sand-shrimp; male,\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCREEPING FORMS: LOBSTERS AND CRAWFISH\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~ASTACOIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Homarus^\r\n\r\nThere are but three species of this genus, which is the most\r\nimportant one of all the /Crustacea/. They are /H. vulgaris/ of\r\nEurope, /H. capensis/ of the Cape of Good Hope, and /H. americanus/,\r\nwhich occurs on the eastern coast of the United States from Labrador\r\nto New Jersey. The lobster-fishery is one of great importance, and of\r\nsuch value that it is governed by stringent laws. The [pg262] annual\r\ncatch on the Atlantic coast of North America amounts to many millions\r\nof lobsters, the money value of which is very large.\r\n\r\n  ^H. americanus^, the common lobster of the Atlantic coast.\r\n  The characteristic feature of the lobster is its enormously\r\n  developed chelæ, or pincer-claws, which are on the first pair of\r\n  walking-feet. Small claws occur on the next two pairs, and simple\r\n  hooks on the remaining two pairs. The appendages on the abdomen are\r\n  divided (biramous). In the female they are used, excepting the last\r\n  pair, for holding the eggs; in the male they are greatly abridged.\r\n  The appendages on the next to last segment are divided and broadly\r\n  flattened, forming with the telson a powerful swimming-paddle. The\r\n  rostrum is very prominent, and has a long, pointed end, slightly\r\n  upturned, and several spines.\r\n\r\n  The lobster belongs to the creeping forms of the order; it walks\r\n  forward by means of the ten feet, but swims backward by using its\r\n  caudal fin. It lives in deep water on rocky bottoms, hiding among\r\n  stones, etc., but frequents sandy shores as well. It lives on\r\n  dead and decaying animal matter, and it would seem strange that\r\n  its flesh is so palatable, were it not that we know that chemical\r\n  combinations which take place in the assimilation of food make one\r\n  kind as clean, when transformed, as another. All the crustaceans\r\n  have a similar dietary, being scavengers of the sea; yet fishes\r\n  find them more acceptable than other animal food, and fishes\r\n  capable of capturing larger prey subsist largely on the minute\r\n  entomostracans described elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Homarus americanus/, American lobster; male.]\r\n\r\n  The lobster is so large that it can easily be dissected, and will\r\n  serve as a type of the structure of /Crustacea/. In dissecting one\r\n  can follow the descriptions given of the anatomy of /Crustacea/\r\n  on page 246, and will be interested in observing the beautiful\r\n  arrangement of the parts and their adaptation to the uses they\r\n  serve. [pg263]\r\n\r\n  The female lobster carries her eggs on the abdominal legs, to which\r\n  they are glued by a kind of cement. After the young emerge from\r\n  the egg, the zoëæ still cling to the mother for a little time.\r\n  The lobster moults eight times the first year, five times the\r\n  second, and three times the third year, after which the male moults\r\n  twice and the female once a year. It retires to some secluded\r\n  spot for this operation, which is attended with many dangers. The\r\n  back splits open longitudinally and the animal slowly withdraws,\r\n  leaving the shell complete. In preparation for moulting, the lime\r\n  around the contracted joints of the chelæ is absorbed, so that the\r\n  soft flesh can pass through. Any injury to a limb at the time of\r\n  moulting, or which results from fighting or from any accident, is\r\n  repaired at successive moultings, and a lost member is replaced by\r\n  a new, but not always a perfect, one.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Panulirus^\r\n\r\n  ^P. interruptus.^ This is the California spiny lobster,\r\n  rock-lobster, or salt-water crawfish. It differs from the common\r\n  lobster /Homarus/ of the Atlantic coast in having no large claws,\r\n  the first pair of feet being simple like the rest, also in having\r\n  antennæ which are enormously long and very large at the base. The\r\n  carapace is beset with spines, and the lateral margins of the\r\n  abdominal segments end in spines. This species lives among the\r\n  rocks on the southern California coast.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Panulirus interruptus/, the spiny or rock-lobster.]\r\n\r\n  ^P. argus^ or ^americanus^ resembles /P. interruptus/, and is found\r\n  on the coast of Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Scyllarus^\r\n\r\n/Scyllarus/ has a broad, almost square carapace, which is uneven and\r\ncoarsely granulated; the anterior corners are sharp, the posterior\r\nones rounded. The antennæ are curiously modified into broad, flat,\r\ndouble plates reaching quite across the straight anterior end of the\r\ncarapace. The under scales of these modified antennæ are rounded and\r\nleaf-like, the upper ones are pointed. The margins of the abdominal\r\nplates on the ventral side are toothed, and on the upper side the\r\nfirst three sections have [pg264] knobs, the third one being the\r\nmost prominent, and forming the posterior extremity when the abdomen\r\nis folded in. The walking-feet are all simple and end in points;\r\nthe first pair are the longest, and the following ones gradually\r\ndiminish in size. The ventral surface is rough and spiny. The abdomen\r\nis of about the same length as the carapace. These animals are found\r\noff the Florida coast and are caught in the fish-traps. They are\r\nuncommon. The very peculiar development of the antennæ makes them\r\nworthy of examination when opportunity offers.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOMALOUS FORMS: ANOMURA\r\n\r\nThe anomalous forms which are intermediate between the suborders\r\n/Macrura/ and /Brachyura/ were, until recently, placed in a suborder,\r\n/Anomura/. The members of this group differ from one another, and\r\nsome of them resemble in external features members of the other\r\ndivisions of the suborders, but there is a difference in anatomical\r\nstructure which separates them in the classification.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~DROMIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Hippoconcha^\r\n\r\n  ^H. arcuata.^ This curious little crab, found on the Florida coast,\r\n  carries the half of a bivalve shell over its back. Its fifth pair\r\n  of thoracic legs are bent over the back, and these, together with\r\n  the fourth pair of legs and the spiny front edge of the carapace,\r\n  enable the crab to hold the shell in position. This crab was\r\n  formerly classed with the hermits, all of which were originally\r\n  called /Bernhardus/, after the monk of that name.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~PAGURIDÆ~\r\n\r\nTHE HERMIT-CRABS\r\n\r\nIn these curious animals the posterior part of the body is not\r\nprotected by a crustaceous covering, and therefore the animal seeks\r\nprotection by inserting its soft and defenseless abdomen into some\r\nhollow object, usually the shell of a gasteropod mollusk, as the\r\nwhelk or the periwinkle (/Buccinum/, /Littorina/). The hermit-crabs\r\ndo not always use a shell for this purpose, as they are sometimes\r\nfound in the tubes of plant-stems or in sponges. Like other\r\norganisms in the animal world, they seem [pg265] well fitted to\r\nmake the best of their surroundings, the body becoming modified to\r\nsuit the peculiar conditions under which they live. In those which\r\ninhabit shells the abdomen becomes spiral, in conformity to the\r\nconvolutions of the shell. All the abdominal appendages are more or\r\nless atrophied; the sixth pair become like hooks, and these fasten\r\nto the columella of the shell, keeping the crab securely attached\r\nto it. In the female some of the abdominal appendages are hair-like\r\nand are adapted to carrying the eggs. The thorax, being protected,\r\nis protruded from the shell at will. The first pair of feet are much\r\nlarger than the others, and are provided with claws (chelæ). The\r\nfirst right foot is usually much larger than the left, and, besides\r\nthe usual functions of capturing and crushing prey, the claw, or\r\nhand, serves as an operculum to close the mouth of the shell when the\r\ncrab retires completely within it. The small left hand is shaped to\r\nfill out the parts of the opening not covered by the right one, thus\r\nmaking a close fit. The next two pairs of feet end in simple hooks,\r\nand are used for walking and dragging the crab along when he travels.\r\nThese crabs move about very fast, and the houses upon their backs\r\nseem no encumbrance. [pg266]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Pagurus bernhardus/: /ch/, chela of first right leg;\r\n/l./4, /l./5, fourth and fifth legs; /t/, abdominal terga; /up/, last\r\npair of appendages, modified to fasten to the columella of the shell\r\nin which the hermit lives.]\r\n\r\nIn some genera both hands are alike; in others the left one is the\r\nlarger. In the case of hermits which live in tooth-shells, the\r\nright hand is cylindrical in form, fitting the circular opening of\r\nthe shell. The other extreme is found in the genus /Cancellus/,\r\nwhere both the chelipeds and the first pair of ambulatory feet are\r\ningeniously shaped, so that when closed they form a round operculum,\r\nor door, which closes the way into the compact sponge which this crab\r\nhas for its carcin[oe]cium, or house. It is interesting to note these\r\ndifferences and observe the perfection with which the feet are formed\r\nand jointed to suit the openings of different shells. Some genera\r\nshow other adaptations to their twisted houses, the eye-stalks being\r\nuneven in length and the ambulatory feet unequal on the opposite\r\nsides. Besides this, some species are hairy and cover themselves with\r\ndirt for further protection. The exposed claws of some hermits have a\r\nspecial armature of spines, which make a fringe of points around the\r\nopening of the shell when the crab is withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAs the hermit grows he is occasionally obliged to find a new or\r\nlarger shell, and there are amusing anecdotes of the troubles he\r\nexperiences at these times while house-hunting. Very often he tries\r\nseveral shells before he finds one to fit. There is a tradition,\r\nnot, however, well authenticated, that if the shell chosen happens\r\nto be occupied by its natural owner, the crab tears out and devours\r\nthe unfortunate occupant. If the desired shell is occupied by\r\nanother hermit inferior in strength to himself, he proceeds to take\r\npossession by violence. He then examines carefully the empty shell,\r\ninserting his legs and feelers, and if he decides to occupy it he\r\nwithdraws his abdomen from the old shell and darts it so quickly into\r\nthe new one that the act of transference is difficult to follow.\r\nAfter walking about with the new shell it sometimes proves to be\r\nunsatisfactory and further search becomes necessary. After it is\r\nwell domiciled the crab never ventures outside the shell until it\r\nis obliged to change again on account of growth, or because some\r\nstronger crab dispossesses him. The shells of hermit-crabs serve\r\nfrequently as the home of other animals which live with them a\r\ncommensal life. The hydroid /Hydractinia polyclina/ often covers\r\nthe exterior of such shells with a brown, velvety growth. Some\r\nsea-anemones also are commensals [pg267] with hermits. /Adamsia\r\npalliata/ is always found on the shell occupied by /Eupagurus\r\nprideaux/, and never on any other. This is a European form. On\r\nour own coast a red anemone, the /Epizoanthus americanus/, found\r\nin deep water off the entire eastern shore, fastens on the shell\r\noccupied by the hermits /Eupagurus pubescens/ and /E. kroyeri/. This\r\nanemone in time absorbs the shell of its host and itself becomes its\r\nprotector--an advantage to the hermit, who finds room in the yielding\r\npolyp-mass for its increasing size, and feels no longer the necessity\r\nfor change of domicile. The female hermit holds its eggs in the\r\nposterior feet until they are hatched; the young are then released,\r\npass into the water, and soon find shells for themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A colony of sea-anemones (/Epizoanthus americanus/)\r\nwhich had completely covered and absorbed a shell occupied by a\r\nhermit-crab (/Eupagurus pubescens/), which still lived within the\r\ncavity. The polyps are not expanded.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pagurus^\r\n\r\n  ^P. bernhardus.^ This is a large species, bright red in color,\r\n  rough and hairy. It inhabits the shells of /Fulgur carica/ or\r\n  of /Polynices heros/. It ranges from Cape Cod northward, and is\r\n  replaced on the northern California coast by /P. alaskensis/ and\r\n  /P. aleuticus/.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Pagurus bernhardus/, the hermit-crab.]\r\n\r\n  ^P. pollicaris.^ This hermit inhabits shells similar to those\r\n  occupied by the last, but is pale red in color, and its surface\r\n  is granulated and not hairy. The short joint of the chela has a\r\n  broad angle. It ranges from Massachusetts to Florida, and occurs at\r\n  low-water mark on rocky and shelly bottoms of bays and sounds.\r\n\r\n  ^P. longicarpus.^ A quick-moving little hermit with long chelipeds,\r\n  found in small shells at the water's edge in quiet places. They\r\n  exist in great numbers and are eaten, shell and all, by fish. This\r\n  species can be distinguished from all others by its very light\r\n  color and metallic luster.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Clibanarius^\r\n\r\n  ^C. vittatus.^ This hermit is found from North Carolina southward\r\n  along the edge of the water and in tide-pools. It cannot be\r\n  mistaken [pg268] for any other hermit common on our coast, since\r\n  it has the very distinctive feature of white longitudinal stripes\r\n  on the ambulatory feet. The chelipeds are about equal, rough with\r\n  tubercles, and the tips have smooth black edges. Body and feet are\r\n  quite hairy. The color is brown and white.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pylopagurus^\r\n\r\nThis genus is represented in Southern waters by several species.\r\nOne of the most characteristic of them lives in /Dentalium/, the\r\ntooth-shell. The outer surface of the right hand is formed to close\r\nthe shell. All the ambulatory feet and the very small left hand fold\r\nbeneath, leaving only the flat surface of one hand exposed to view.\r\nAnother species lives in a shell covered with polyzoans.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CENOBITIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cenobita^\r\n\r\n  ^C. diogenes.^ This large hermit-crab, found in Florida and in more\r\n  southern waters, inhabits the beautiful pearly shell of /Livona\r\n  pica/. It lives on land a part of the year, but spends the breeding\r\n  season in the water. It can be distinguished by its land-roaming\r\n  habits, its large left cheliped, very stout walking-legs, and\r\n  compressed eye-stalks. This species climbs the hills, but is more\r\n  frequently met with in low, shaded, marshy places. (Plate LIX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~HIPPIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Hippa^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Hippa talpoida/, the sand-bug.]\r\n\r\n  ^H. talpoida.^ This animal, commonly known as the \"sand-bug,\"\r\n  differs greatly in appearance from a crab. When the appendages are\r\n  folded under the carapace it somewhat resembles an egg, the body\r\n  being ovate, about half as broad as long, and the sides forming a\r\n  nearly regular curve. The carapace is about one and a half inches\r\n  long, convex, yellowish-white, and nearly smooth. The abdomen is\r\n  long and pressed under the body, reaching nearly to the front.\r\n  The eyes are minute and on the ends of long, slender stalks. The\r\n  antennæ are plume-like and about as long as the carapace. /Hippa/\r\n  lives on sandy beaches at or near low-water mark, exposed to the\r\n  action of the waves. It burrows with great rapidity into the loose\r\n  and shifting sands, using the short and stout second, third, and\r\n  fourth thoracic legs and the appendages of the sixth abdominal\r\n  segment [pg269] for pushing and digging. Crabs of this species\r\n  are gregarious and may be seen in great numbers, though but few\r\n  will be captured together by digging, as they rapidly disappear\r\n  beneath the sand. Sometimes they are found swimming about in the\r\n  tide-pools. They seem to live upon the organic particles contained\r\n  in the sand, which they swallow, the mouth not being adapted for\r\n  mastication. This species ranges from Cape Cod to Florida. (Plate\r\n  LXI.)\r\n\r\n  ^H. analoga.^ Similar to /H. talpoida/, but broader and flatter. It\r\n  is bluish above, yellowish-white below, and the fringing hairs are\r\n  black. Found on the California coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Albunæa^\r\n\r\n  ^A. gibbesii.^ This animal is found with /Hippa/, and, like it,\r\n  burrows rapidly in the sand. Its general outline is square. The\r\n  surface of the carapace is marked off with denticulated lines,\r\n  which make the back appear as if composed of plates. The front edge\r\n  of the carapace has a row of teeth and a prominent spine at the\r\n  anterior angles. The abdomen is doubled under itself (not fitting\r\n  into a groove of the thorax, as in ordinary crabs), this animal\r\n  being intermediate between the long- and the short-tailed forms.\r\n  The eyes are on triangular, plate-like stalks. The antennules are\r\n  very long and are fringed with hair. The chelipeds have claw-like\r\n  joints, which close across the straight, broad end of the hand.\r\n  The first two pairs of walking-feet have curious sickle-like\r\n  terminal joints. The animal is about one and a quarter inches long.\r\n  /Albunæa/ does not extend as far north as /Hippa/, its range being\r\n  from Georgia southward. (Plate LXI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~PORCELLANIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThe crabs of this family are little more than one quarter to one half\r\nof an inch across the back. The chelipeds are broad and flattened.\r\nThe first three pairs of walking-legs are well developed, and the\r\nfifth pair are very small and are doubled over the base of the\r\ncarapace. The sixth segment of the abdomen has a pair of biramous\r\nappendages, which, with the telson, form a swimming-fan.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Porcellana^\r\n\r\n  ^P. sayana.^ Carapace little longer than broad; breadth about one\r\n  quarter of an inch; smooth; has three acute denticulations between\r\n  the eyes, the middle one the largest and depressed in the center;\r\n  two denticulations on each anterior side; chelæ fringed with hair\r\n  on the edges; walking-legs somewhat hairy; fifth pair of legs\r\n  folded over base of carapace; color reddish, with white spots.\r\n  This species was once called /occulata/, because of the eye-like\r\n  spots over its entire surface. The posterior part and abdomen have\r\n  longitudinal bands of color. The claws are marked like the shell.\r\n  Found from South Carolina southward, often in the shells inhabited\r\n  by hermit-crabs. (Plate LXI.)

Found from\r\n  South Carolina southward. (Plate LXI.)\r\n\r\n  ^P. armatus.^ Carapace longer than broad; breadth about one\r\n  quarter of an inch; prominent and wide between the eyes; a small\r\n  sharp spine on each anterior side; chelipeds long; second joint\r\n  of cheliped twice as long as broad, with three teeth on the front\r\n  edge and four or five small spines on the outer edge. Found on the\r\n  Florida coast. (Plate LXI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~LITHODIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThe species of this family have a broad, ovate, uneven body and\r\na prominent rostrum. The fifth pair of legs are rudimentary and\r\nare folded under the carapace in the branchial chambers, so that\r\nthe crabs appear to have but four legs on each side. This is\r\nthe distinguishing feature of the family, and makes them easily\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Lithodes^\r\n\r\n  ^L. maia.^ The carapace is cordate (heart-shaped), and longer than\r\n  broad, exclusive of the rostrum. The margin is recurved all around,\r\n  and is beset with numerous very long spines. Six spines on each\r\n  anterior side margin are regular and longer than the others. The\r\n  surface of the carapace is covered with tubercles and spines and\r\n  elevated in places. The rostrum is spiny, a third as long as the\r\n  carapace, and has two spines at the base, one above the other,\r\n  a spine at each side, two lateral spines near the middle, and\r\n  two terminal divergent spines. The chelipeds are unequal and are\r\n  covered with spines, those on the inner margin being the longer.\r\n  The color is yellowish-red, lighter underneath; the spines are\r\n  darker.

The chelipeds and legs are beset with large tubercles and\r\n  fold together in such a manner that when retracted the crab is a\r\n  close, compact, box-like mass, with a very rough, [pg271] spiny\r\n  armature. The antennæ are broad at the base and covered with small\r\n  spines on the sides and upper surface, and the eye-stalks are also\r\n  spiny. This crab sometimes attains the size of ten inches across\r\n  the carapace and a weight of seven pounds, being among the largest\r\n  crabs known. It is found at the mouth of the Columbia River and\r\n  along the northwest coast. (Plate LXII.)\r\n\r\n  ^E. foriminatus.^ This species resembles /E. cibarius/ in the\r\n  manner of closing the feet, forming a compact, box-like, spiny\r\n  armature. The body is more depressed than that of the latter,\r\n  and the cone-like elevations on the back are less prominent. The\r\n  spines are hairy. The characteristic feature of this species is a\r\n  semicircular cut in the second joints of the chelipeds, directly\r\n  opposite to similar depressions in the first walking-legs, so that\r\n  when the feet are folded a round hole is left, through which water\r\n  flows freely to the gill-openings, which might, without these open\r\n  holes, be obstructed by the close folding of the legs against the\r\n  carapace. Found off the California coast near San Francisco. (Plate\r\n  LXII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Acantholithodes^\r\n\r\n  ^A. hispidus.^ The whole body in this species, including the legs,\r\n  is covered with hairy spines. The abdomen is broad, and covers\r\n  about the whole under surface of the body, and is also beset with\r\n  hairy spines, but they are less prominent than those on the upper\r\n  side. The rostrum, terminating in spines, reaches to the tips of\r\n  the eye-stalks, which are also spiny. The chelipeds are larger and\r\n  longer than the walking-feet; the latter taper to a point, ending\r\n  in a sharp nail. The shape of the body resembles somewhat that of\r\n  a toad. This is a deep-water species, but it is sometimes brought\r\n  ashore at Monterey, California, by fishermen who find it in the\r\n  stomachs of fishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cryptolithodes^\r\n\r\n  ^C. sitchensis.^ The most striking characteristic of this singular\r\n  species is the great development of the carapace, which forms\r\n  a broad, thin shield extending beyond the body and legs, and\r\n  completely hiding the animal beneath it. The carapace is smooth\r\n  and uneven, has a high ridge through the center of the anterior\r\n  part, and the sides are broadly expanded and bluntly pointed at the\r\n  extremity. The rostrum appears like a small rectangular piece cut\r\n  out of the anterior side of the carapace. This species is found in\r\n  the Strait of Fuca. A similar species, /C. typicus/, is found near\r\n  low-water mark on the surf-washed rocks of the beach at Monterey,\r\n  California. (Plate LXII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Phyllolithodes^\r\n\r\n  ^P. papillosus.^ The carapace is triangular, about two inches\r\n  wide at the base, and narrowing to a long, pointed rostrum which\r\n  terminates in a forked spine. The surface of the carapace is deeply\r\n  depressed in parts, and forms a heart-shaped figure in the center.\r\n  The lateral margins have four prominent spines on each side, the\r\n  two at the posterior ends being [pg272] thicker than the other\r\n  two. The abdomen is broad, covering the whole under side of the\r\n  body, and is marked off with prominent raised ridges diverging from\r\n  the center line. The legs are all beset with long, rough spines.\r\n  Habitat, the northwest coast. Taken from the stomachs of fishes off\r\n  Monterey, California. (Plate LXII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ~BRACHYURA~\r\n\r\nTHE CRABS\r\n\r\nThis group contains the true crabs, which are the highest of the\r\n/Crustacea/. In form they are quite the reverse of the first group.\r\nIn the /Macrura/--except in the anomalous forms--the body is long\r\nand cylindrical and the abdomen extended, but in the /Brachyura/ the\r\nbody is flat and broad and the abdomen short and reflexed. Crabs of\r\nthis suborder inhabit all seas of the globe, and are found from the\r\nshore to great depths. Some species live on land, some on the shore,\r\nsome in deep water. Some forms burrow in the sand; others live under\r\nstones and boulders, or conceal themselves in crevices of rocks or\r\nin the cavities of sponges. They are divided into many families,\r\nand creep, climb, swim, or burrow, their structure being modified\r\nto their respective modes of life. There is also great variation in\r\ntheir shapes as well as in their color and markings. This diversity\r\nis so great and peculiar that it seems as though each one were more\r\ncurious than the others.\r\n\r\nIn crabs the cephalothorax is depressed and often broader than long.\r\nThe abdomen is relatively small and is folded under the thorax, lying\r\nin a groove which it fits so perfectly as to be quite hidden from\r\nabove. The appendages of the abdomen are much reduced in number. The\r\nmale has two pairs; the female has four pairs, which it uses for\r\ncarrying its eggs. The first pair of walking-legs are comparatively\r\nlarge, and end in chelæ, or pinching-claws. The other eight legs\r\nterminate in simple points, except in the swimming varieties, when\r\nthe fifth pair is flattened to form fins, or swimming-paddles. The\r\neye-stalks are long and fit into sockets on the carapace. Both pairs\r\nof feelers are small. The antennules are frequently folded into small\r\ngrooves. The external or third pair of maxillipeds are broad and\r\nflat, and cover the mouth-parts like a lid, or operculum. [pg273]\r\n\r\nCrabs, like other crustaceans, are scavengers, living on dead animal\r\nmatter; but the land species are also vegetarian in diet. They are\r\ngreat fighters, but are also wily, often averting danger by resorting\r\nto stratagem. They are an interesting and curious group, as they\r\npossess a good degree of intelligence and have amusing habits.\r\n\r\nFrom the time they leave the egg until they attain the adult form\r\nthey pass through several complete and singular metamorphoses. The\r\nmost marked forms are called the /Zoëa/ and the /Megalops/. So little\r\ndo these resemble the adult that originally they were classed as\r\ndistinct genera far removed from the one to which they really belong.\r\nAfter the larva has moulted several times it appears as in the\r\nillustration on page 248--the last zoëa stage. From this it changes\r\ndirectly to /Megalops/; the /Zoëa/, seeming to be attacked with\r\nviolent convulsions, wriggles out of its skin a full /Megalops/ (page\r\n248). The animal then has enormous eyes, an extended abdomen, an\r\nelongated carapace, and swimming-legs. This stage is a short one, and\r\nat the first moulting changes to a form nearly approaching the adult.\r\nFrom this time they grow by shedding the shell at certain periods.\r\nThis shedding is supposed to occur twice each summer until they have\r\nreached full growth, after which it is probable that they do not\r\nagain moult; for often they are found with extraneous organisms,\r\nsuch as barnacles and sponges, upon them, of a size that must have\r\nrequired a considerable period of time for growth. The sexes of\r\nthe same species sometimes differ so much that it is difficult to\r\nclassify them. Even naturalists have been led into the error of\r\nassigning the male and female to separate species.\r\n\r\nThe front side margins of the carapace in many crabs are edged with\r\na row of teeth or with spines, which vary in number and character\r\nin different species. In the spider-crabs the whole surface of the\r\ncarapace is generally studded with tubercles, spines, and stiff hairs\r\nof a peculiar character. This armature is for protective purposes,\r\nand is often used to secure foreign bodies, such as algæ, hydroids,\r\nand polyzoans, which the crabs place upon their backs to disguise\r\nthemselves. The burrowing crabs are usually smooth. When in motion\r\nthe crab moves sideways, using the legs [pg274] of one side to pull\r\nwith and those of the other side to push with. As all the legs do\r\nnot move at the same time, a continuous and uniform motion is kept\r\nup. Some species move with great rapidity, notably the sand-crab,\r\n/Ocypoda arenaria/. Often when pursued they will run into the surf\r\ninstead of to their holes. The common edible crab, /Callinectes\r\nsapidus/, of the Atlantic coast, the fiddler-crabs, and the\r\nspider-crabs are among the well-known representatives of /Brachyura/.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~PORTUNIDÆ~\r\n\r\nSWIMMING CRABS\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Carcinides^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Carcinides mænas/, the green crab.]\r\n\r\n  ^C. mænas^ (M. J. Rathbun), ^Carcinus mænas^ (Leach), the green\r\n  crab. This is one of the most common species on the Atlantic coast\r\n  from Cape Cod to New Jersey, and is very abundant in Vineyard\r\n  Sound, Buzzard's Bay, and Long Island Sound. It is found between\r\n  tide-marks, frequently well up on the beach, hiding under loose\r\n  stones, also in tide-pools and in holes and cavernous places on\r\n  the shore. It is from one and a half to two inches long, and a\r\n  little more in breadth. It has five acute teeth on each side of the\r\n  anterior part of the carapace. Its color is green, spotted with\r\n  yellow, making it quite conspicuous. The surface of the carapace\r\n  and limbs is more or less granulated. The posterior feet are\r\n  flattened to form swimming-paddles. It is a very lively creature\r\n  and has reckless audacity when brought to bay, which justifies its\r\n  specific name (which implies frenzy). The French call it /crabe\r\n  enragé/. [pg275]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Callinectes^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Callinectes sapidus/, the blue crab.]\r\n\r\n  ^C. sapidus^ (Mary J. Rathbun), ^C. hastatus^ (Stimpson), the blue\r\n  crab. This is the common edible crab of the Atlantic coast. It is\r\n  known at the North as the \"blue crab,\" and at the South as the\r\n  \"sea-crab.\" It is found from Cape Cod to Florida, and after the\r\n  lobster is the crustacean which has the greatest commercial value,\r\n  being taken in immense quantities for the markets, not only when\r\n  the shell is hard, but immediately after moulting, before the new\r\n  shell has hardened, when it is known as the \"soft-shelled crab.\"\r\n  It inhabits muddy shores, and is common in bays and at the mouths\r\n  of estuaries. The carapace is about twice as broad as it is long,\r\n  and has a long, sharp spine on each side which projects outward.\r\n  This is a distinguishing feature. There are eight short spines on\r\n  each side between the long spines and the eyes; then come recesses\r\n  for the eyes, and between the eyes are four unequal teeth and a\r\n  small spine underneath. The chelæ are large and somewhat unequal\r\n  in size; then come three pairs of simple feet and a fifth pair,\r\n  which are flattened, forming swimming-organs. The margins of the\r\n  carapace and abdomen are fringed with fine hairs, as are also most\r\n  of the joints of the limbs. The upper surface of the body and claws\r\n  is dark green in color, the lower surface is dingy white, the feet\r\n  blue, and the tips of the spines reddish. The body is compressed,\r\n  the carapace being moderately convex above, and is covered with\r\n  minute granulations, which are more numerous over some portions\r\n  than over others. The abdomen of the female is very broad and fills\r\n  the entire space between the bases of the posterior pair of feet.\r\n  During the spawning season it is so charged with eggs that often\r\n  it projects out almost at right angles with the carapace. The\r\n  [pg276] crabs of this species are very active and can swim rapidly.\r\n  They also have the habit of pushing themselves backward into the\r\n  mud for concealment. They are predaceous and pugnacious, and have\r\n  great strength in their claws, which they use with dexterity.\r\n  They not only fight their own kind, but show a bold front to all\r\n  enemies, including man. The average size is six inches across the\r\n  carapace.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ovalipes^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Ovalipes ocellatus/, the lady-crab.]\r\n\r\n  ^O. ocellatus^ (Rathbun), ^Platyonichus ocellatus^ (Latreille),\r\n  the lady-crab or sand-crab. A species common on sandy shores from\r\n  Cape Cod to Florida. It is found among the loose sands at low-water\r\n  mark, even on the most exposed beaches, and also is abundant on\r\n  sandy bottoms offshore. At low-water mark it buries itself up\r\n  to the eyes and antennæ in the sand, where it watches for prey\r\n  and foes, and quickly disappears beneath the sand when danger\r\n  approaches. It possesses the power of burrowing in common with\r\n  other marine animals which inhabit exposed beaches of loose sand.\r\n  By burying itself deep in the sand it is protected from the action\r\n  of the breakers. This species is easily distinguished by the color\r\n  and shape of its carapace, taken in connection with its posterior\r\n  swimming-feet. The body is nearly as long as it is broad, with\r\n  five prominent spines on each side. The front margin is indented\r\n  on each side of a three-spined rostrum, to form cavities for the\r\n  eyes. The first limbs are large and have claws; the posterior ones\r\n  are flattened into swimming-feet, and the intermediate three pairs\r\n  are simple in structure, ending in points. In color it is white,\r\n  covered with spotted rings of red and purple. [pg277]\r\n\r\n\r\nWALKING CRABS\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CANCROIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cancer^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Cancer irroratus/, the rock-crab; male.]\r\n\r\n  ^C. irroratus^, the rock-crab. This is the common crab of the New\r\n  England coast. It ranges from Labrador to South Carolina, but is\r\n  rare south of New Jersey. It is found on sandy as well as on rocky\r\n  shores at and below low-water mark and also between tide-marks,\r\n  hiding among rocks, nearly buried in sand or gravel, and in\r\n  tide-pools, where sometimes amusing combats between the males may\r\n  be seen. The carapace is suboval, one third broader than long,\r\n  the breadth being often from three to four inches. The surface is\r\n  granulated but smooth; the color is yellowish, closely dotted with\r\n  brown. The eyes are on short stalks in deep, circular holes, and\r\n  between the eyes are small teeth. There are nine blunt teeth along\r\n  each side of the front edge of the carapace. The first pair of legs\r\n  are short and stout, and terminate in claws. The four posterior\r\n  pairs are slender and end in pointed tips. This is an edible crab,\r\n  and it is devoured by the larger fishes, but does not--although\r\n  there seems to be no reason for it--share to any extent a place in\r\n  the markets with the blue crab, /Callinectes sapidus/.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Cancer borealis/, the Jonah crab; male.]\r\n\r\n  ^C. borealis^, the Jonah crab. This crab resembles, and is\r\n  frequently taken for, /C. irroratus/. It is larger than the latter\r\n  in full growth, and is heavier and more massive. The carapace and\r\n  claws are rougher, the granules being irregular in size. The legs\r\n  are proportionately shorter and heavier. The teeth on the anterior\r\n  margins are rounded in front, but the posterior ones are sharply\r\n  pointed. In color [pg278] it is brick-red above and yellowish\r\n  beneath. It inhabits rocky shores only and is found at low tide on\r\n  the surface of the rocks, where it is exposed to the action of the\r\n  waves and also to the attacks of birds of prey, which feed upon\r\n  it, while /C. irroratus/, concealed under the rocks in the same\r\n  locality, escapes their depredations. This species is supplied to\r\n  the Newport market, where it is considered preferable to the blue\r\n  crab. Its range is from the eastern end of Long Island to Nova\r\n  Scotia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Cancer magister/, the common crab of the Pacific\r\ncoast; male.]\r\n\r\n  ^C. magister.^ This species inhabits the Pacific coast and ranges\r\n  from Alaska to Lower California. The adult male is from seven to\r\n  nine inches broad and from four to five inches long. The anterior\r\n  margin of the carapace is an almost regular elliptical curve with\r\n  nine small teeth on each side. At the end of the curve a large,\r\n  pointed tooth projects directly outward, and from this the carapace\r\n  slopes abruptly backward, giving a narrow posterior end. The\r\n  surface of the carapace is undulated and covered with papillæ, and\r\n  is light reddish-brown, shading to lighter color in the back. The\r\n  color of the legs and under surface of the animal is yellowish.\r\n  The claws are toothed above and ribbed at the sides. It inhabits\r\n  sandy bottoms below tide-mark and is the largest and most important\r\n  edible crab of the western coast.\r\n\r\n  ^C. productus^, the red crab. This species, like the preceding one,\r\n  is of large size and inhabits the western coast from Alaska to\r\n  the Gulf of California. The carapace is four and a half inches in\r\n  length, from five to seven in breadth, and somewhat elliptical in\r\n  outline. The teeth on the anterior margin are distinctly separate\r\n  in the adult, but in the young appear as wrinklings of the edge\r\n  of the carapace. The posterior margins are concave. In color the\r\n  animal is dark red above and yellowish beneath in the adults, but\r\n  variable in the young, sometimes being yellow spotted with red,\r\n  or banded with red and yellow. It inhabits rocky shores. This is\r\n  an edible crab, but is not taken for the markets, /C. magister/\r\n  supplying all demands. [pg279]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Cancer productus/, the red crab; male.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Cancer antennarius/, the California rock-crab.]\r\n\r\n[pg280]\r\n\r\n  ^C. antennarius^, the rock-crab of the Pacific coast. This\r\n  species of the California coast inhabits rocky bottoms below\r\n  low-water mark. The carapace is three and a half inches long by\r\n  five or six inches wide, and dark purplish-brown in color. The\r\n  chelæ are marbled with purplish spots and are nearly smooth. The\r\n  distinguishing features of this crab are its large and hairy\r\n  antennæ, the hirsute margins of its abdomen and walking-feet, and\r\n  the numerous hairs on the under side of its body.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Menippe^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Menippe mercenaria/, the stone-crab; male.]\r\n\r\n  ^M. mercenaria^, the stone-crab. This species lives in deep holes\r\n  in the mud along the borders of creeks and estuaries, and also\r\n  in crevices between fragments of rock, in stone-heaps and other\r\n  debris, and is found from South Carolina to Texas. These crabs are\r\n  edible, and in some localities are hunted for food, one manner\r\n  of capturing them being to thrust the hand and arm into their\r\n  holes and drag them out, an operation attended with danger to the\r\n  inexperienced hunter, who is likely to be badly pinched. They are\r\n  withdrawn with difficulty, as they offer a strong resistance,\r\n  bracing themselves with their claws against the sides of their\r\n  holes, and often hold so firmly to the rocks that they are torn\r\n  [pg281] apart. They are also taken by a hooked iron which is thrust\r\n  into the hole; the crab seizes it and is then suddenly jerked from\r\n  its hole. The adult measures about three by four and a half inches,\r\n  and the body is from one inch to two inches thick. One of the chelæ\r\n  is larger than the other, and both are proportionately enormously\r\n  large, and are tipped with black. The terminal joints of the other\r\n  four pairs of legs are thickly fringed with hairs and end in points\r\n  which seem like nails.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMER GENUS ^Panopeus^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Eurypanopeus depressus/, the mud-crab; male, natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\n  ^Eupanopeus herbstii^, ^Eurypanopeus depressus^, ^Neopanopeus\r\n  texana^, ^Rhithropanopeus harrisii^ (Mary J. Rathbun). These four\r\n  species, formerly all called /Panopeus/, are small crabs which live\r\n  in the mud and are commonly known as mud-crabs. They are abundant\r\n  under stones in muddy places, and occur on the Atlantic coast from\r\n  Massachusetts Bay to Florida, though they are not commonly met with\r\n  north of New Jersey. /Eupanopeus herbstii/ is the largest one of\r\n  the group, some of the Southern ones measuring two inches across.\r\n  It is found living in mud at low-water mark, or burrowing in banks\r\n  near high-tide mark. It is dark olive-brown, the claws broadly\r\n  tipped with black. /Eurypanopeus depressus/ is flattened above,\r\n  and is smaller than /Neopanopeus texana/, which is somewhat convex\r\n  above. The last two are commonly found together and have similar\r\n  habits. /Rhithropanopeus harrisii/ lives near high-water mark and\r\n  also in salt-marshes, and is comparatively rare. The claws lack the\r\n  dark tips of /E. herbstii/, and a distinct groove follows the edge\r\n  of the carapace.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~GRAPSIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Hemigrapsus^\r\n\r\n  ^H. nudus^ (Mary J. Rathbun), ^Heterograpsus nudus^ (Stimpson);\r\n  ^H. oregonensis^ (Mary J. Rathbun), ^Heterograpsus oregonensis^\r\n  (Stimpson). These two species, commonly called respectively the\r\n  /purple shore-crab/ and the /yellow shore-crab/, are the most\r\n  abundant species of the California coast. Hundreds may be found\r\n  congregated under a single rock. They range from Sitka to Lower\r\n  California. /H. oregonensis/ literally swarms in sloughs of salt\r\n  or brackish water, and hundreds of uplifted threatening claws\r\n  confront the intruder who ventures on these mud-flats when the tide\r\n  is out. This species, the yellow shore-crab, has a nearly square\r\n  body. The anterior half of the side margins has two rather deep\r\n  indentations, [pg282] making two spine-like projections which bend\r\n  forward. The four posterior pairs of legs are more or less hairy;\r\n  the chelæ are rather large in proportion. The male is about one\r\n  inch across and the female is one third less in size. The general\r\n  color is yellow. /H. nudus/ is found in the same localities, and\r\n  differs from /H. oregonensis/ in being purple in color, with\r\n  mottled claws, and in having the denticulations less pronounced\r\n  and the walking-feet devoid of hairs. It is also a little larger.\r\n  (Plate LXIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pacygrapsus^\r\n\r\n  ^P. crassipes.^ A species very common on the California coast south\r\n  of San Francisco. This crab is similar in general features to the\r\n  purple and yellow ones described above, but is considerably larger,\r\n  and the carapace is banded with color.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~OCYPODIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ocypoda^\r\n\r\n  ^O. arenaria^, the sand- or ghost-crab. The name /Ocypoda/ means\r\n  \"swift-footed,\" and, as it implies, this species is especially\r\n  noted for its rapidity of movement. These crabs are the opposite\r\n  of the strong-armed, thick-shelled, slow-moving /Cancroidæ/. An\r\n  instance is told of a collector having great difficulty to keep up\r\n  at full run with one which he chased for a considerable distance\r\n  over the sand. They are also dexterous in burrowing, and live in\r\n  holes, often three feet deep, dug perpendicularly into the sand.\r\n  They wander far from their burrows when the tide is out, and\r\n  every little while raise their stalked eyes and stand on tiptoe\r\n  to look about. If alarmed, they run with great rapidity to the\r\n  nearest burrow, or, if danger is close, press themselves on the\r\n  sand until an attempt is made to touch them, when they again dart\r\n  away rapidly, and in running hold their bodies high, and double\r\n  and dodge so that it is difficult to catch them. /Ocypoda/ is\r\n  colored almost exactly like the sand, and this mimicry, together\r\n  with its fleetness, makes it interesting to note and difficult\r\n  to capture. It inhabits sandy beaches above tide-mark from Long\r\n  Island to Brazil, and subsists largely upon the beach-fleas, which\r\n  inhabit the same localities. It springs upon them, very much as a\r\n  cat catches a mouse. The carapace of this species is almost square\r\n  in outline, and on the anterior corners ends in a spine. A small\r\n  portion of the carapace folds down like a band between the eyes. On\r\n  each side of this band, and extending across the front, are large\r\n  grooves for the eye-stalks. The body is about an inch thick; the\r\n  first joints of the chelæ are toothed; one chela is a little longer\r\n  than the other, and both are coarsely granulated. The other four\r\n  pairs of legs are thickly fringed with hairs. (Plate LXIII.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXIII. Hemigrapsus nudus. Hyas araneus. Ocypoda\r\narenaria. Pugettia gracilis. Libinia dubia. Pitho aculeata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Uca/ (/Gelasimus/) /pugilator/, the fiddler-crab;\r\nmale.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Uca^\r\n\r\n  ^U. minax^ (^Gelasimus minax^), ^U. pugnax^ (^Gelasimus pugnax^),\r\n  ^U. pugilator^ (^Gelasimus pugilator^), the fiddler-crabs. These\r\n  species [pg283] of fiddler-crabs occur on the Atlantic\r\n  coast. They congregate in immense numbers, and excavate their\r\n  holes in convenient localities above the reach of the tides--on\r\n  salt-marshes, far up the estuaries, and along the mouths of rivers,\r\n  even where the water is quite fresh. The males have one claw very\r\n  largely developed; the other chela is small. The former is likened\r\n  to a fiddle, the latter to a bow, and this, together with the\r\n  waving motion of the large claw, gives them their popular name.\r\n  This comparatively enormous claw is a distinguishing feature by\r\n  which they are easily recognized without other description. The\r\n  female has claws of small and equal size. These crabs burrow holes\r\n  in the mud or sand half an inch to two inches in diameter and a\r\n  foot or more in depth. The upper part is nearly perpendicular,\r\n  becoming horizontal below, with a chamber at the end. One species,\r\n  /U. minax/, constructs an archway over the mouth of its burrow, in\r\n  which it sits and surveys the surroundings, but quickly retreats\r\n  when danger approaches. The crab makes its burrow by scraping up\r\n  the mud or sand and forming it into pellets, which it carries under\r\n  the three anterior walking-feet on the under side, using the legs\r\n  on the side moving forward, and the fourth one on the other side,\r\n  to climb out of the hole. After peering cautiously about, the\r\n  crab emerges, and carries its load four or five feet away before\r\n  dropping it; then again looks about before quickly running back;\r\n  and, finally, turning its stalked eyes, looks in all directions\r\n  and suddenly disappears, soon to return with another load. The\r\n  burrows cover considerable areas, and the crabs are so abundant\r\n  that the marshes and shores sometimes seem to be alive with them.\r\n  When alarmed, they lift the large claw and run sideways, after\r\n  the manner of all crabs, to their holes, and, as many are likely\r\n  to retreat into the most convenient one, the owner often finds\r\n  his burrow occupied by other tenants, whom he unceremoniously\r\n  proceeds to pull out. /U. minax/ ranges from southern New England\r\n  to Florida, and lives on salt-marshes farther away from the sea\r\n  than the others, and often where the water is quite fresh. It\r\n  is larger than the other species, and can be distinguished by a\r\n  red patch at the joints of the legs. It is a vegetarian in diet,\r\n  living on small algæ. This is the species which constructs a little\r\n  observation-house over the mouth of its burrow. It can live out of\r\n  water, and without food, for several days. /U. pugilator/ lives\r\n  on sandy and muddy flats and beaches near high-water mark, where\r\n  the sand is compact and somewhat sheltered, and ranges from Cape\r\n  Cod to Florida. This species, like /U. minax/, is a vegetarian.\r\n  /U. pugnax/ is exceedingly abundant on muddy banks and ditches of\r\n  salt-marshes, the banks being sometimes completely honeycombed and\r\n  undermined by them. It ranges from Cape Cod to Florida. [pg284]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~MAIIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThe members of this family are known as \"spider-crabs.\" Their bodies\r\nare thick and more or less round in form, narrowing in front to\r\na long, beak-like projection. The surface is generally rough and\r\nirregular, having tubercles, spines, prickles, and hairs. The legs\r\nare long. These crabs are often covered with seaweeds, hydroids,\r\nand other organisms, which they gather with their long and flexible\r\nchelipeds and place upon their backs, presumably to conceal\r\nthemselves from their enemies. They seem to select, instinctively or\r\nwith reason, such things as will bear transplanting, sometimes using\r\nsponges and polyps which are not destroyed by being torn apart, and\r\nthey also select their dress with reference to its masking uses. A\r\n/Hyas/ covered with bright-colored algæ was seen to remove them and\r\nreplace them with sponges, when transferred to the locality of the\r\nlatter, where the former did not grow. The animal takes in his claw\r\nthe object he has gathered, and first holds it to his mouth, where it\r\nis moistened with a secretion of mucus or cement, and then places it\r\non his back. If it does not hold, the operation is repeated, often\r\nseveral times, a new spot on the shell being selected each time. It\r\nhas also been found that the coats of these crabs are covered with\r\nhairs which are differently arranged in different genera, some being\r\nhooked, others serrated, etc., and that these aid in holding the\r\ntransplanted organisms in place. The crab is sometimes so covered\r\nwith these growths as to be entirely concealed beneath them. It is a\r\nsluggish animal, and inhabits shallow water along the whole of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific coasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Libinia^\r\n\r\n  ^L. dubia^, ^L. emarginata^. These two species inhabit the\r\n  Atlantic coast, and are found on muddy shores and flats, among\r\n  decaying seaweed, in eel-grass, and even beneath the surface of\r\n  the mud. They are covered with hairs, and sometimes have planted\r\n  on their backs algæ, hydroids, and even barnacles. The legs of /L.\r\n  emarginata/ often spread a foot or more. The males are much larger\r\n  than the females. The species ranges from Maine to Florida. /L.\r\n  dubia/ does not extend north of Cape Cod. It is found more commonly\r\n  than /L. emarginata/ in very shallow water [pg285] near shore. It\r\n  is not so thickly covered with spines, and has a longer rostrum,\r\n  which is also more deeply divided at the end. (Plate LXIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Hyas^\r\n\r\n  ^H. coarctatus^, the toad-crab. This species of spider-crab is\r\n  found from Greenland to New Jersey, in shallow as well as in deep\r\n  water. Its body resembles strongly, both in form and size, that of\r\n  a toad, hence its common name. It forms an important part of the\r\n  food of the cod.\r\n\r\n  ^H. lyratus.^ A toad-crab of the Pacific coast, ranging from Bering\r\n  Sea to Puget Sound; named from the lyre-shape of its carapace.\r\n\r\n  ^H. araneus.^ A species which especially resembles a toad in its\r\n  form. Found off the northern New England coast. (Plate LXIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Loxorhynchus^\r\n\r\n  ^L. crispatus^, the sheep-crab. This crab occurs on the coast of\r\n  southern California. The body is thick and about three inches\r\n  across the widest portion, and tapers to a long, prominent rostrum.\r\n  It is covered with long tubercles and spines and with short,\r\n  bristly hairs; the legs are long, the chelipeds stretching fully\r\n  two feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pugettia^\r\n\r\n  ^P. gracilis.^ A small spider-crab found on the Pacific coast from\r\n  Alaska to Puget Sound. Its body is one half of an inch wide and\r\n  [pg286] one inch long, with prominent spines on the sides of the\r\n  carapace, which narrows in front into a long beak ending in two\r\n  spines. It is red and green above, red beneath. (Plate LXIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Sternorhynchus^\r\n\r\n  ^S. sagittarius.^ This is one of the most delicately formed of the\r\n  spider-crabs. The body has narrow longitudinal stripes of light and\r\n  dark color. It lives offshore from Cape Hatteras southward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Epialtus productus/, the kelp-crab; female.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Epialtus^\r\n\r\n  ^E. productus^, the kelp-crab. This crab inhabits the coasts of\r\n  California and Oregon, and is found among seaweeds on rocks just\r\n  below low-water mark. The carapace is smooth, is quadrate in form,\r\n  is about two inches long and broad, has two spines on each side,\r\n  and has a prominent denticulated rostrum. This is the most common\r\n  spider-crab of the Pacific (California) coast. It is olive-green,\r\n  thus simulating in color the kelp among which it lives. (See page\r\n  285.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pitho^\r\n\r\n  ^P. aculeata.^ The carapace has six spines on each side, the\r\n  middle two being sometimes partly united; the general outline is\r\n  pentagonal; the length about one inch. Quite common on the Florida\r\n  coast. (Plate LXIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Lambrus^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Lambrus pourtalesii./]\r\n\r\n  ^L. pourtalesii^, the long-armed spider-crab. The carapace is\r\n  broader than it is long and has three elevations all covered with\r\n  spines. The general surface is pitted and granulated; the rostrum\r\n  points downward; the chelipeds are very long, the margins armed\r\n  with spines; the breadth of the carapace is about one and a half\r\n  inches; and the length of the chelipeds is about three and a half\r\n  inches. Its range is from Cape Cod to Florida, and it lives among\r\n  the rocks. (Plate LXIV.) [pg287]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CALAPPIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Calappa^\r\n\r\n  ^C. flamma^, the box-crab. This singular animal lives on sandy and\r\n  muddy bottoms offshore, from North Carolina southward. The carapace\r\n  is broad and straight on the posterior side, and is curved on the\r\n  anterior side, narrowing to the front. The posterior side has\r\n  prominent denticulations. The body is one and a half inches thick,\r\n  about four to five inches wide, and two to three inches long.\r\n  The chelæ are large, broad, and flattened, and are so arranged\r\n  that when flexed they fit closely together across the front. When\r\n  folded, and the small legs are withdrawn under the carapace, the\r\n  animal is shut up as if in a box, and resembles a shell. When in\r\n  danger it closes its doors, as it were, and abandons itself to the\r\n  waves, which often carry it ashore. The crested claws resemble the\r\n  head of a cock. (Plate LXIV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~PINNOTHERIIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pinnotheres^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Pinnotheres ostreum/, the oyster-crab; male, enlarged\r\nfour diameters.]\r\n\r\n  ^P. ostreum^, the oyster-crab. The female of this species lives\r\n  in the gill-cavity of the oyster, and is particularly abundant in\r\n  oysters from the Chesapeake. The males are seldom seen, and rarely\r\n  occur in the oyster, but swim freely about. They are smaller than\r\n  the female, have a firmer shell, and are dark brown above, with a\r\n  dorsal stripe and two conspicuous spots. The under side of the legs\r\n  is whitish. The female is commensal, at least in the adult form,\r\n  and its thin, whitish, transparent carapace is tinged with pink.\r\n  The species ^P. maculatum^ lives in /Mytilus edulis/ (mussel) and\r\n  in the smooth scallop, /Pecten magellanicus/. The oyster-crab is a\r\n  true messmate, and its presence in the oyster may be advantageous\r\n  in helping to provide food for its host. This crab, like the rest,\r\n  holds its eggs in the posterior feet until hatched, when the larvæ\r\n  leave the parent and swim about for a while. The females, at the\r\n  megalops stage, enter oysters--sometimes two enter the same oyster,\r\n  but seldom more than one; there it remains permanently, growing to\r\n  the size of an inch or more in diameter, and becomes a degenerate.\r\n  The eyes become smaller; the shell never hardens, like its allies\r\n  which live in open water; its limbs and chelæ are weak; and it has\r\n  no pugnacity, the protection afforded by the oyster doing away with\r\n  the need for the common protective features of its kind. /Pinnixa\r\n  cylindrica/, a related species, lives in the tubes of large annelid\r\n  worms as a commensal. [pg288]\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =STOMATOPODA=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Squilla^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Squilla empusa/, the mantis-shrimp.]\r\n\r\n  ^S. empusa.^ This animal suggests somewhat the lobster, though very\r\n  unlike it. The carapace is much smaller and softer, and leaves\r\n  the last three segments of the thorax uncovered. The abdomen is\r\n  larger and longer in proportion, while the legs and organs are\r\n  quite different. The whole body is depressed, instead of laterally\r\n  compressed. It measures from eight to ten inches in length and two\r\n  inches in breadth. Instead of chelæ, the last joint of the great\r\n  claw has six sharp curved spines, which fit into sockets in a\r\n  groove on the second joint. By this singular organ they hold their\r\n  prey securely. The abdominal feet carry the gills. The antennal\r\n  scales are oblong and fringed with hair. The antennules terminate\r\n  in three flagella. The caudal appendages and telson are long,\r\n  strong, and armed with spines. This animal lives in burrows in the\r\n  mud below low-water mark, forming large, irregular holes, but is\r\n  frequently washed ashore. In color it is pale yellowish-green, each\r\n  segment being bordered with darker green and edged with yellow. It\r\n  is found from Cape Cod to Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =CUMACEA=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Diastylis^\r\n\r\n  ^D. quadrispinosus.^ Among the minute /Crustacea/ which swim on the\r\n  surface of the water, this species, with other small forms, may be\r\n  captured by using a muslin net. It is a quarter of an inch or less\r\n  in length. It is easily distinguished by its large carapace, the\r\n  posterior portion of which is marked off in transverse ridges, the\r\n  anterior end running into a sharp-pointed rostrum. It has a long,\r\n  slender abdomen, the sections of which [pg289] are distinctly\r\n  marked, and it terminates in long, forked spines, which are longer\r\n  than the telson. It is found from New Jersey northward.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =ARTHROSTRACA=\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ~AMPHIPODA~\r\n\r\nThe /Amphipoda/ have a laterally compressed body, with gills on the\r\nthoracic feet and an elongated abdomen. The segments of the thorax\r\nare not united, nor covered by a carapace, but the whole body is\r\ncovered with a segmented, polished, flexible cuticle. The three\r\nanterior legs of the abdomen are for swimming-feet, and the posterior\r\nones are adapted for springing. The antennæ are long and hairy. The\r\namphipods comprise the beach-fleas and many other small crustaceans\r\nwhich abound between tide-marks on all beaches. Besides serving in no\r\nsmall measure as food for fishes, they are scavengers of the beach,\r\nand consume large quantities of waste matter. They are sometimes\r\nused in preparing skeletons for anatomical specimens. Animals to be\r\nskeletonized, being fastened to boards and anchored just below the\r\nsurface of the water in sheltered places, are divested of all flesh\r\nin a few hours, and the bones are more completely cleaned than if\r\nprepared by a naturalist.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Orchestia^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Orchestia agilis/; male.]\r\n\r\n  ^O. agilis^, the beach-flea. These little crustaceans exist in\r\n  countless numbers under the masses of sea-wrack on the beach. When\r\n  disturbed they jump about with great agility by means of the last\r\n  three pairs of abdominal feet, which are adapted to this purpose.\r\n  In color the animal is brown and much resembles the decaying\r\n  seaweeds among which it lives and upon which it probably feeds. The\r\n  antennules are short, the antennæ long, on two long, jointed bases.\r\n  The second pair of feet in the males terminate in chelæ. The last\r\n  abdominal appendages are stiff and pointed backward. The abdomen is\r\n  curved under. The length of /Orchestia/ is half an inch or less.\r\n  Some species occur on all beaches. /O. agilis/ ranges from New\r\n  Jersey to Greenland.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Talorchestia^\r\n\r\n  ^T. longicornis^ (^Talitrus longicornis^). This species is similar\r\n  to Orchestia agilis, but is about an inch long when mature and\r\n  of a paler [pg290] color. It jumps like the latter, but not so\r\n  strongly. It is found among the weeds and burrowing in the sand\r\n  a little below high-water mark. The wet sand is often completely\r\n  filled with its holes. It can be distinguished by its very long\r\n  antennæ. Another species, ^T. megalophthalma,^ is distinguished by\r\n  its shorter antennæ and very large eyes. Both of these species are\r\n  grayish in color and closely resemble the sand. Found from Cape Cod\r\n  to New Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Gammarus^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Gammarus locusta/, the scud.]\r\n\r\n  ^G. locusta.^ The animals of this genus are among the largest of\r\n  the amphipods. The males are larger than the females, sometimes\r\n  being one and a half inches long. They are abundant under stones\r\n  and /Fucus/ at and near low-water mark. Although much larger than\r\n  the beach-fleas, they otherwise resemble them. They do not jump\r\n  like the former, but move rapidly, lying on the side, and in water\r\n  swim with the back downward. Two pairs of the thoracic feet are\r\n  chelate, and three pairs are longer than the others. The feet\r\n  on the last segments of the abdomen are stiff and turn sharply\r\n  back, forming a part of the tail, which is used most effectively\r\n  in locomotion. The antennules and antennæ are of about the same\r\n  length. Several species of /Gammarus/ occur in the same range, all\r\n  having the same general characteristics; some have but one pair of\r\n  chelate feet; the antennules are usually shorter than the antennæ;\r\n  the females of all the species have no chelate feet. /G. locusta/\r\n  ranges from New Jersey to Greenland. The color is generally\r\n  reddish- or olive-brown. ^G. annulatus^ is found in the same\r\n  places, but usually a little higher up on the beach; it is lighter\r\n  in color, and has dark bands with red spots on the sides of the\r\n  abdomen. ^G. mucronatus^ occurs from Cape Cod to Florida. ^Melita\r\n  nitida^ is a smaller slate-colored amphipod found in some places;\r\n  another is ^M[oe]ra levis^, which is whitish, with black eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Chelura terebrans/, the boring amphipod.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Chelura^\r\n\r\n  ^C. terebrans^, the boring amphipod. This little crustacean\r\n  is associated in its work on submerged timber with the isopod\r\n  /Limnoria lignorum/. The excavations of the latter are narrow and\r\n  cylindrical, running down into the wood, while /Chelura/ makes\r\n  larger burrows in oblique lines near the surface, which give the\r\n  wood the appearance of having been plowed. It is very active and\r\n  destructive. It feeds upon the wood into which it burrows. Its\r\n  color is semi-translucent, thickly mottled above with pink. [pg291]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Caprella^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Caprella geometrica./]\r\n\r\n  ^C. geometrica.^ These very curious little animals, which are so\r\n  slender as to seem like skeletons, are found in abundance clinging\r\n  to hydroids, /Polyzoa/, delicate algæ, or eel-grass, or under\r\n  stones in tide-pools. They resemble in color, and often in form,\r\n  the objects on which they live. Holding on by the posterior feet,\r\n  they extend the body out rigidly or sway it about, so that they\r\n  resemble little sticks or branches, and often escape detection. In\r\n  walking, they bring the hind feet up to the front ones, doubling\r\n  the body into a loop like the canker- or measuring-worm. The\r\n  appendages on the anterior and posterior ends are furnished with\r\n  chelæ and hooks; those of the middle section are rudimentary. This\r\n  animal cannot be mistaken for any other. /C. geometrica/ is found\r\n  from Cape Cod to North Carolina. Some of the species of this genus\r\n  may be found on every coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ~ISOPODA~\r\n\r\nThe isopods have an elongate, flattened, but more or less arched\r\nbody, composed of seven thoracic segments and a short abdomen of\r\nsix segments. The six segments of the abdomen are smaller than\r\nthose of the thorax, and are often more or less united, sometimes\r\ninto a single piece with scarcely any trace of division above; but\r\nthe number of pairs of appendages is generally six, showing the\r\ncomposite nature of the apparently simple organ. The last segment,\r\nor telson, is broad and has a pair of modified appendages. The seven\r\nthoracic legs are not all equal, as the name would imply, but vary\r\ngreatly in different species. As a rule, they are adapted to walking\r\nor attachment, and in the female some have delicate plates which\r\nform brood-pouches. The swimming-feet fold under the abdomen, and\r\nin some species are inclosed by the first pair, which are large and\r\nplate-like, and form a complete cover for the others. The isopods\r\nare a large and widely distributed order, varying in size, and\r\nare inconspicuous because they cling closely to objects. They are\r\nretiring in habit, though extremely ferocious.\r\n\r\nThe sow-bugs or pill-bugs, common in gardens, under leaves in the\r\nwoods, and under almost any pile of rubbish among decaying vegetable\r\nmatter, are a land species of isopods. Other species inhabit [pg292]\r\nponds and streams of fresh water, and still others are found along\r\nthe shores of all oceans, abounding among the marine vegetation\r\nof the shallow waters. Some swim free in the open sea; others are\r\nbrought up from the greatest depths. Others, again, are parasites,\r\nand live in the internal organs of fishes and prawns. Sometimes\r\na prawn is found having what appears like a very swollen throat,\r\nwhich actually is a little parasitic isopod of the family /Bopyridæ/\r\nattached to its gills.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cirolana^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Cirolana concharum./]\r\n\r\n  ^C. concharum.^ The body consists of fourteen segments, the first\r\n  being the head, the next seven the thorax, and the last six the\r\n  abdomen. On the head are the triangular eyes, the antennules, and\r\n  the antennæ, and underneath is the mouth, which is covered by the\r\n  maxillipeds. The dorsal surface is more or less rounded. At the\r\n  bases of all the segmental thoracic rings excepting the first one\r\n  are sutures marking off square, scale-like pieces (/epimera/). The\r\n  epimera form a border to the side margins. The legs are attached to\r\n  the epimera, which are, in fact, the upper segments of the legs.\r\n  The first three pairs of legs have a general resemblance to one\r\n  another, and are directed forward. The last four pairs are much\r\n  longer and flatter, and are directed backward. The telson, or last\r\n  segment, is triangular, and the square or blunt apex is fringed\r\n  with hairs. On the ventral surface of the thorax in the adult\r\n  females there is a long pouch for the reception and development\r\n  of the eggs. This species is usually about one and a half inches\r\n  in length, but sometimes is longer. Its color is yellowish, with\r\n  a brown edge on the posterior margins of the segments, somewhat\r\n  translucent in the thinner parts. It is found from Cape Cod to\r\n  South Carolina, swimming about in shallow water, and is especially\r\n  abundant in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Limnoria^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Limnoria lignorum/, the gribble.]\r\n\r\n  ^L. lignorum^, the gribble. This little isopod is very destructive\r\n  in its habits, boring into submerged woodwork, like the ship-worm\r\n  (Teredo), and doing great damage to the piles of wharves, etc. It\r\n  burrows to the depth of half an inch, and completely honeycombs\r\n  the surface of the wood, which then scales off or rapidly decays,\r\n  and is washed away by the waves. The animal then begins anew,\r\n  and in a short time, or at the rate of about an inch a year,\r\n  piles diminish in diameter where /Limnoria/ is plentiful, and are\r\n  finally destroyed unless protected from these little crustaceans\r\n  by a sheathing of metal. Although considered as pests, they have\r\n  an economic value not so often recognized, as they attack all\r\n  driftwood, and in time entirely destroy floating and water-logged\r\n  [pg293] timber, which without their destructive agency might become\r\n  serious obstructions to navigation. /Limnoria/ is only the fifth\r\n  of an inch in length, and its back is covered with minute hairs,\r\n  to which dirt usually adheres. It burrows with its mandibles, or\r\n  jaws, which are chisel-like at the ends. Its habitat extends from\r\n  a little above to a little below tide-marks throughout the whole\r\n  Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Sphæroma^\r\n\r\n  ^S. quadridentatum.^ The name of the genus to which this species\r\n  belongs is derived from the peculiar habit of many of the species\r\n  of rolling themselves into a ball when alarmed. The body is so\r\n  constructed as to admit of this singular change of shape. The\r\n  abdomen turns under, and the last abdominal appendages, together\r\n  with the narrow epimera, shut in the legs and cover the ventral\r\n  portions with armor. The body, when extended, is an ellipse a\r\n  little over a quarter of an inch in length and half that in\r\n  breadth. The legs are hairy and adapted to walking. The anterior\r\n  abdominal segments are fused into one, but are marked at the sides\r\n  with depressed lines. The abdominal feet are plate-like and fringed\r\n  with hairs. A slight elevation runs around the margins of the\r\n  animal like a border. The color is variable. Some are a uniform\r\n  slaty gray; others are marked with a longitudinal patch of color\r\n  on the back. It is found from Cape Cod to Florida among algæ or\r\n  rocks, and is easily recognized by its habit of rolling itself\r\n  into a ball. ^Sphæroma destructor^ is a boring isopod, larger than\r\n  /Limnoria/, and is even more destructive, since its holes are\r\n  larger; but its range is limited, or, at least, it has so far been\r\n  found only in the St. Johns River, Florida.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Sphæroma quadridentatum./]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Idotea^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Idotea marina./]\r\n\r\n  ^I. marina^ (Linnæus), ^I. irrorata^ (Edwards). This species is\r\n  about one inch long, and is easily recognized by the abdomen, the\r\n  first three segments of which are narrow and terminate in acute\r\n  teeth, while the other three are fused into one with straight sides\r\n  and ending in three teeth, of which the middle one is the longest.\r\n  The first pair of abdominal feet are large, long, and plate-like,\r\n  covering the other feet and whole under surface of the abdomen like\r\n  an operculum. The head is nearly square, the eyes are small, and\r\n  the antennæ have long peduncles. The articulations of the thoracic\r\n  feet are fringed with hair. The color of this species varies:\r\n  sometimes it is light or dark green, or brown with black spots;\r\n  again [pg294] it is striped longitudinally with light color.\r\n  Sometimes the stripes run transversely in bands or spots. It is\r\n  found from New Jersey northward on rocky shores of bays and sounds,\r\n  or in eel-grass on sandy shores.\r\n\r\n  ^I. ochotensis.^ A species very similar to the preceding, but a\r\n  little larger, found on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\n  ^I. metallica.^ This species is a little smaller than /I. marina/,\r\n  and differs from it in having the end of the telson truncated, or\r\n  straight, instead of dentate. The head is nearly square. The body\r\n  is broadest in the middle of the thorax; the projecting epimera\r\n  give a serrate appearance to the sides. The abdominal feet are\r\n  inclosed in the operculum-like scales of the first pair of feet.\r\n  Its color is bright blue or green, often with a metallic luster\r\n  when seen in the water. It is found swimming free or floating in\r\n  masses of seaweeds from Long Island northward and also on the\r\n  Pacific coast.\r\n\r\n  ^I. wosnesenskii.^ A common species on the California coast,\r\n  about one inch long and dark in color. The abdominal segments are\r\n  united and bluntly rounded, and each has a small median tooth. The\r\n  abdominal feet are inclosed by the opercular feet.

It is found on the New England coast.\r\n\r\n  ^C. entomon^ (Linnæus). This species of the northern Pacific coast\r\n  is from one to three inches long.

This well-known\r\n  and curious animal ranges along the Atlantic coast from Maine\r\n  to Mexico. [pg295] It lives on sandy and muddy shores below\r\n  low-water mark, where it burrows beneath the surface. At the\r\n  breeding season--May, June, and July--it comes ashore to deposit\r\n  its eggs near high-water mark. The crabs come up the beach in\r\n  pairs, the male being the smaller and riding on the back of the\r\n  female, holding on by short feet provided with nippers, which\r\n  are peculiar to the males. Sometimes the female is accompanied\r\n  by several males, each one holding on to the tail of another and\r\n  forming a string of animals. After the female has deposited her\r\n  eggs in a hole excavated by her for the purpose, the male covers\r\n  them with milt, and they then return to the water, leaving the\r\n  eggs to be buried in the sand by the action of the waves. The eggs\r\n  hatch in July and August, and sometimes the beach is literally\r\n  alive with the young crabs, which, however, soon disappear, and\r\n  are not seen again until they are well grown. After the spawning\r\n  season the adults are not very often seen, but usually their empty\r\n  shells, abandoned in moulting, may be found on the shore. The\r\n  horseshoe-crab, also called king-crab, is especially interesting\r\n  from the fact that it is the last survivor of an otherwise extinct\r\n  group of animals. Its relationships with classes which have become\r\n  extinct, its nearest relatives being fossils, make it difficult\r\n  to classify definitely with existing forms. Formerly it was\r\n  regarded as a crustacean; now it is classed by some authors with\r\n  the /Arachnida/, along with scorpions and spiders. It has the\r\n  characteristics of both groups. There are only two known species of\r\n  /Limulus/ in the world; the other, ^Limulus moluccanus^, lives on\r\n  the eastern coast of Asia. /L. polyphemus/ often measures a foot in\r\n  diameter. The body is composed of three parts. The front portion,\r\n  or cephalothorax, is broad and semicircular, with posterior angles\r\n  ending in points. Near each side of its dorsal surface is a pair of\r\n  large compound eyes covered with thickened cuticle, and near the\r\n  center line of the shell, at the base of the first spine, a pair\r\n  of small, simple eyes. The second portion is the abdomen, and the\r\n  third a long, movable spine attached to the last segment of the\r\n  abdomen and between two terminal points of the horn-like covering.\r\n  [pg296] On the cephalothorax are seven pairs of appendages. The\r\n  first pair are small and lie in front of the mouth; these and\r\n  the four following pairs have chelæ, or claws. The sixth pair\r\n  have no chelæ, but at the base have a peculiar process termed the\r\n  flabellum. These six pairs of appendages surround the mouth, and\r\n  have bristles at the base which serve as jaws. The seventh pair of\r\n  thoracic appendages are broad plates called the operculum, which\r\n  meet and cover the abdominal appendages to a certain extent. The\r\n  abdomen has five pairs of appendages, which are plate-like and\r\n  resemble the operculum in form and have an upper and an under\r\n  piece. On the posterior surfaces of the abdominal feet are large,\r\n  leaf-like folds, which are the gills. In front of the first pair\r\n  of thoracic legs is a small tubercle supposed to have an olfactory\r\n  function. /Limulus/ has a blood-vascular system (the blood being\r\n  bluish in color), a nervous and a digestive system. It walks with\r\n  the thoracic feet and swims with the abdominal ones. It enters\r\n  the sand by pushing in the rounded, anterior end. In moulting the\r\n  carapace opens on the front edge. /Limulus/ is edible, its meat\r\n  being, it is said, as good as that of the lobster.

About one hundred\r\nand fifty species of /Pycnogonida/ have been described, of which\r\nthirty are found on our coast and are commonly known as sea-spiders.\r\nThey are found crawling slowly over seaweeds, hydroids, and sponges,\r\nand appear to be all legs, but, like other animals, have a digestive,\r\na circulatory, and a nervous system. They are devoid of organs of\r\nrespiration. The body has a cephalothorax, which bears a conical\r\nsuctorial proboscis on the anterior end, and on top a prominence\r\ncontaining four eyes. It has three pairs of appendages, two pairs\r\nof which are sometimes lacking; then come three free segments and\r\na rudimentary abdomen. There is a pair of short appendages bearing\r\nclaws (chelæ) and four pairs of long walking-legs. The walking-legs\r\ncontain a tubular outgrowth of the body, into which the stomach\r\nextends. The egg-sacs are in the legs, and open at the basal joints.\r\nThe male is provided with an extra pair of legs, for the purpose of\r\ncarrying the eggs after they are deposited by the female. The\r\n[pg297] ovigerous legs are run through sac-like pockets and bent\r\nunder the body, and thus the eggs are carried until hatched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXIV. Calappa flamma.

Recent investigations have demonstrated that the larval\r\nform of mollusks presents some remarkable points of similarity to\r\nthe embryonic forms of the /Annelida/ and to the larvæ of some other\r\nclasses of lower organisms. This discovery is one of the triumphs\r\nof embryology in its patient search for that connecting-thread that\r\nweaves together all the varying forms of animal life. Aside from\r\nthese subtle evidences of relationship revealed by the microscope,\r\nthe mollusks appear to occupy a position of considerable isolation in\r\nthe biological world.\r\n\r\nAs accepted by zoölogists to-day, this phylum is but the remnant of\r\nits former self. Aristotle considered all creatures with a testaceous\r\ncovering to belong to a single family, and those later patriarchs of\r\nbiology, Linnæus, Cuvier, and Lamarck, extended the group to include\r\nthe greater part of all the marine invertebrate animals. Little by\r\nlittle the phylum has been shorn of orders and classes. First, the\r\nworms and the /Echinodermata/ were separated into distinct phyla;\r\nthen the barnacles were discovered to be crustaceans, and were\r\naccordingly removed from their position as \"multivalves\" under the\r\n/Mollusca/; then the tunicates, or ascidians, were found, through the\r\ncritical examination of their larval stage, to be merely masquerading\r\nas mollusks; and lastly, the brachiopods have been somewhat\r\nreluctantly removed from their old position with the mollusks and\r\ngiven the [pg306] distinction of a phylum almost exclusively to\r\nthemselves: they retain their old associations only in the name of\r\n/Molluscoida/.\r\n\r\nWith some exceptions, all mollusks secrete from their outer skin, or\r\nmantle fold, a calcareous protective covering, or shell. This may be\r\neither \"univalve\" or \"bivalve\" according as it consists of one or two\r\npieces. This phylum includes all the sea-shells which are so commonly\r\nfound along every ocean beach, in the tide-pools, on rocks at low\r\ntide, in estuaries, and, indeed, wherever sea-water is present. The\r\nphylum also includes, as one of its large suborders, all the snails\r\nand slugs that are to be found crawling upon the land. These are true\r\nmollusks, which differ essentially from their marine brethren only in\r\nthat they breathe by means of a pulmonary sac or lung instead of by\r\ngills. There are also many genera and species of mollusks that find\r\ntheir habitat only in the fresh water of rivers, lakes, or ponds;\r\ncuriously enough, many of these fresh-water forms, like the purely\r\nterrestrial snails and slugs, are air-breathers, possessing no gills\r\nwhatever, and are consequently obliged to make periodic visits to\r\nthe surface of the water to obtain their necessary supply of oxygen.\r\nThere are also numerous forms of mollusks that are entirely deprived\r\nof a shell covering; and, again, there are intermediate types\r\nbetween these two extremes that produce only more or less developed\r\nrudimentary shells. Notwithstanding these variations in the matter\r\nof a shell covering,--an important consideration in this phylum,--by\r\nreason of their anatomical features these \"naked\" forms are mollusks\r\nquite as much as are those that secrete the most highly developed\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nThe marvelous beauty of sea-shells and tropical land-shells,\r\ntheir almost infinite variety in form and coloring, has given to\r\nthem an interest among collectors that is very great. There are\r\nmany wonderful conchological collections in public museums and in\r\nprivate cabinets. It would well repay the lover of beauty as well\r\nas the more serious student of nature to examine carefully such\r\ncollections when opportunity offers, for nowhere in the realm of\r\nnature can more exquisite coloring and modeling be found. The fact\r\nthat shells may be preserved for all time without the expense and the\r\nvexations of preservative fluids has no doubt induced many [pg307]\r\nto choose this field of natural history for special study. But the\r\ntrue student of zoölogy does not confine his investigations in this\r\nphylum to considerations of the shell only, for the protective\r\narmor constitutes only a portion, although an important portion, of\r\nthe anatomy of the mollusk. On the same principle, it would hardly\r\nsuffice to examine only the skeleton of vertebrate animals in order\r\nto become acquainted with the fishes or mammals. In a sense, the\r\ntestaceous covering of a mollusk may be likened to an outer skeleton.\r\n\r\nThe older zoölogists were inclined to ignore almost entirely the\r\nanimal or \"soft parts\" of mollusks, and their classification of\r\nthe phylum into \"univalve,\" \"bivalve,\" and \"multivalve,\" based\r\nupon shell-characters alone, has since been proved to be wholly\r\nartificial. The terms \"univalve\" and \"bivalve\" are, of course, often\r\nand correctly used to-day to designate mollusks possessing a single\r\nor a double shell, such as the common garden-snail, which carries\r\nupon its back a single spiral shell, and, on the other hand, the\r\noyster or clam, which is inclosed within two valves which fit closely\r\ntogether. But these terms are not /technically/ used, although\r\nthey do indicate in a general way the more modern classification.\r\nEven among some comparatively recent conchologists a tendency to\r\nbelittle the value of the \"slimy creature\" within the shell has led\r\nto some curious errors of grouping--mistakes which more thorough\r\nand scientific investigation has brought to light. In general, the\r\nhigher classification into classes, orders, suborders, and families\r\nis exclusively based upon anatomical features, and to a large extent,\r\nalso, is that of the genera; but species are always determined by\r\ntheir shell or conchological characteristics.\r\n\r\nWhen a certain familiarity with the forms and general appearance of\r\nshells is gained, a glance at the shell alone will almost always\r\nsuffice to place it at once in its true generic position, for, along\r\nwith modifications of the animal itself, corresponding modifications\r\nof the shell are quite certain to take place. Hence a fairly expert\r\nzoölogist should be able to determine with considerable accuracy from\r\nan empty and dead shell the anatomical features of the animal that at\r\none time inhabited it. [pg308]\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons for the special interest that seems to have\r\nattached to the study of conchology is derived from the fact that the\r\ndurability of shells has caused their almost perfect preservation\r\nas fossils from the very earliest periods of geological time, thus\r\nfurnishing the key to the solution of many problems of evolution.\r\nUpon this page of the earth's history the letters are sharp and\r\nclear, and geologists possessing a knowledge of recent forms of\r\nmollusks as well as of their geographical distribution have been\r\nenabled to read some wonderful stories of the cosmic history of\r\nislands and continents.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nMollusks are found in every part of the world. The arctic seas\r\npossess their own characteristic faunæ, the more temperate waters of\r\nEurope and of America contain their own peculiar genera and species,\r\nand the warm waters of the tropic seas furnish the conditions\r\nfavorable to the life of an immense number of characteristic forms.\r\nAgain, there are the littoral species, that live only between\r\ntide-marks and are therefore exposed to the air for a number of\r\nhours each day; some of these live just about high-tide mark and\r\nhave become almost terrestrial in their habits, while others must be\r\nsought at the point of lowest tide, where for only a short time each\r\nday they are deprived of their natural element. Then there are the\r\nshallow-water forms, which never appear above low-tide mark save when\r\na neap tide surprises them; their range in depth extends to about\r\nthe hundred-fathom line, more or less. Beyond this depth to several\r\nhundred fathoms other characteristic forms appear, and from the more\r\nprofound depths of mid-ocean the dredge has brought to light a host\r\nof curious and interesting species.\r\n\r\nIt is the temperature of the water rather than the depth that appears\r\nto influence the distribution of marine mollusks. Thus, certain\r\nspecies whose natural home is in the shallow waters of the Arctic\r\nOcean have been taken in very deep waters off the southern coast of\r\nthe United States, the temperature conditions in both stations being\r\nsubstantially the same. This fact, however, must not be too freely\r\naccepted as establishing a principle. Some [pg309] shallow-water\r\nforms have been taken at great depths, but in general the abyssal\r\nfauna is a peculiar one that cannot well be marked off into\r\ngeographical provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARCTIC PROVINCE\r\n\r\nThe east coast of America is divided into several molluscan\r\nfaunal regions. A series of very-cold-water forms belonging to a\r\ncircumpolar region, called the \"arctic province,\" are found as far\r\nsouth as Newfoundland. On the New England coast a number of these\r\narctic species are also found, urged south by the influence of the\r\ncold Labrador current. The most characteristic genera belonging to\r\nthis arctic fauna which are found upon the Maine and Massachusetts\r\ncoasts are /Buccinum/, /Chrysodomus/, /Sipho/, /Trophon/, /Bela/,\r\n/Velutina/, /Trichotropis/, /Lacuna/, /Margarita/, /Pecten/, /Leda/,\r\n/Yoldia/, /Astarte/, and /Mya/. Examples of all these genera are\r\nencountered as far south as Cape Cod.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOREAL PROVINCE\r\n\r\nA \"boreal province\" corresponds with a similar faunal region upon\r\nthe European shore. The mollusks which compose this fauna are about\r\nthree hundred in number, and range along the New England coast from\r\nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence to Cape Cod. It is a somewhat remarkable\r\nfact that many of these species are identical with English and French\r\nforms. The striking genera upon the American side are /Purpura/,\r\n/Littorina/, /Polynices/ (/Lunatia/ and /Neverita/), /Acmæa/,\r\n/Margarita/, /Chiton/, /Doris/, /Æolis/, /Mytilus/, /Modiola/,\r\n/Thracia/, and /Nucula/.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSATLANTIC PROVINCE\r\n\r\nCape Cod has been regarded, until very recently, as a sharp\r\ndivisional point between the boreal and the transatlantic provinces,\r\nthe latter faunal area extending down the Atlantic coast of the\r\nUnited States to southern Florida. At Cape Cod the Labrador current\r\nis deflected from the coast, and the warmer shore waters south of\r\nthat point are unfitted for the development of the boreal forms,\r\nthough some of them, as we shall see, have passed the [pg310]\r\nbarrier and maintain themselves very successfully at Martha's\r\nVineyard and in Long Island Sound. Some of the species whose natural\r\nhabitat is south of Cape Cod are also to be found north of that\r\npoint, but they do not reach their full development in the colder\r\nwaters of Massachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\nThe long stretch of coast-line from Cape Cod to Florida is easily\r\nsusceptible of faunal subdivision at Hatteras, below which locality a\r\ndecided mixture of Antillean species is apparent. Between Long Island\r\nSound and Hatteras the littoral molluscan fauna is disappointing\r\nto the collector, for the number of species is relatively small,\r\nand few even of these are entitled to any claims to beauty of\r\nshell. The nature of this coast, virtually a great sweep of exposed\r\nsand-beach, is not conducive to a varied or rich fauna. But if this\r\nportion of the transatlantic province is lacking in interest to\r\nthe shell-collector, it is anything but disappointing to the army\r\nof men employed in the oyster- and clam-fishery. It is only within\r\nthis faunal area that the American oyster, /Ostrea virginica/, the\r\nbest of the edible shell-fish, finds its natural home, and here the\r\noyster-culture is most extensively carried on.\r\n\r\nAfter storms the Jersey beaches are frequently strewn with /Mactra/,\r\n/Tagelus/, /Arca/, and /Ensis/; in more sheltered places /Fulgur/ and\r\n/Polynices/ (/Lunatia/) are commonly met. These may be accepted as\r\nthe most characteristic genera of this province.\r\n\r\nJust south of Cape Hatteras an observer is struck with the sudden\r\nchange in the appearance of the shells on the beach. /Cardium/,\r\n/Cassis/, /Dolium/, /Arca/, and /Cancellaria/ at once suggest\r\nthe West Indies. About the vicinity of Hatteras the Gulf Stream\r\napproaches very near the land, bringing with its warm waters many\r\nwanderers from tropical homes. From Beaufort to Florida there is\r\nanother long stretch of exposed and shifting sand-beach, which offers\r\na scant return to the collector of mollusks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARIBBEAN PROVINCE\r\n\r\nWhen Florida is reached a new world is opened to the naturalist,\r\nfor there a better acquaintance is made with the great Caribbean\r\nprovince, which, extending from Florida to the northern shores of\r\nSouth America, embraces all the Bahamas, the West [pg311] Indies,\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, and the coast of Central America. Strangely\r\nenough, the mollusks of the west coast of Florida are more nearly\r\nrelated to those of the transatlantic province than are the shells\r\nof the east Florida coast. This remarkable fact in geographical\r\ndistribution can only be explained by assuming that an open waterway\r\nonce existed across the northern part of the Florida peninsula,\r\nconnecting the Atlantic and the Gulf, through which a mingling of the\r\nshallow-water forms from Georgia, the Carolinas, West Florida, and\r\nthe Gulf coast took place. Thus it would appear that when Florida\r\nwas an island the fauna of its east coast, originally largely\r\nAntillean, was less disturbed by the southern migration of American\r\nspecies. The Florida Keys are essentially Antillean. The Caribbean\r\nor Antillean fauna is an exceedingly rich and varied one. Among the\r\nmost prominent genera which may be encountered upon the Florida coast\r\nare /Strombus/, /Fasciolaria/, /Oliva/, /Marginella/, /Natica/,\r\n/Sigaretus/, /Littorina/, /Tectarius/, /Neritina/, /Melongena/,\r\n/Cardium/, /Callista/, /Tellina/, /Lucina/, and /Cyrena/. In such an\r\nextensive and rich faunal province one must not expect to find in any\r\ngiven locality a representation of all the characteristic genera. For\r\ninstance, collections made at Havana, at Nassau, and at Vera Cruz\r\nwould each contain forms more or less peculiar and local, but certain\r\nspecies would be found in each collection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the west coast of America quite the same faunal division into more\r\nor less well-marked provinces is to be found. Bering Sea belongs to\r\nthe arctic province, and contains, with Labrador and Greenland, many\r\nidentical forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALEUTIAN PROVINCE\r\n\r\nThe shore waters from the southern peninsula of Alaska down to about\r\nVancouver comprise the Aleutian province. Within this area occur\r\nsome arctic species, notably the soft-shell clam, /Mya arenaria/,\r\nwhich the fishermen gather in such large quantities for bait along\r\nthe Maine coast. An increasing number of species common to this\r\nwest-coast faunal region and to the boreal province of the east coast\r\nare being recorded. Some of [pg312] these have been introduced from\r\nthe East by the agency of man, but others no doubt have a natural\r\nrange through the icy waters north of America and down through the\r\nBering Sea into the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CALIFORNIAN PROVINCE\r\n\r\nThe Californian province extends from the neighborhood of Vancouver\r\nto Cape St. Lucas and has about five hundred species. The northern\r\nportion of this area contains some very characteristic forms,\r\ntogether with a good mixture of species of more northern habitat;\r\nit might properly be regarded as a subprovince. From San Diego\r\nsouth to the cape the character of the fauna gradually changes;\r\nthis coast-line of southern California has also been considered a\r\nsubregion. The main characteristic of the Californian province is a\r\nlarge development of /Haliotis/, of the patelliform mollusks, and\r\nof the chitons. A very few minutes on any good collecting-beach\r\nof California would convince the Eastern conchologist that he had\r\nentered upon an entirely new field of research. The most notable\r\ngenera are /Calliostoma/, /Chlorostoma/, /Scurria/, /Acmæa/, various\r\ngenera of the /Chitonidæ/, /Purpura/, /Monoceras/, /Amphissa/,\r\n/Norrisia/, /Olivella/, /Chorus/, and /Haliotis/.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PANAMIC PROVINCE\r\n\r\nThe warmer waters of the Gulf of California belong to the Panamic\r\nprovince, which extends down to South America. This is one of the\r\nrichest and most interesting faunas in the world. At Panama alone,\r\nMr. C. B. Adams, a noted collector and student of conchology, took\r\nupward of four hundred species. About eight hundred species are known\r\nin the Gulf of California alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that these faunal provinces relate to\r\nlittoral and shallow-water species, for the present knowledge of\r\ndeep-water forms is not sufficient to permit of generalization upon\r\ntheir distribution.\r\n\r\nWe review here only the conspicuous forms along our own coasts. It\r\nmay be well to note, however, that in some other parts of the world\r\nthe development of molluscan life is far [pg313] in excess of\r\nanything to be found upon our shores. The veritable paradise of the\r\nnaturalist is the East Indies. There the \"aristocratic\" genera, so\r\ncalled on account of their marvelous beauty, occur in their highest\r\ndevelopment--/Voluta/, /Mitra/, /Oliva/, /Conus/, and the various\r\nmurices. There also are to be found the pearl-oysters, /Meleagrina\r\nmargaritifera/, that yield their valuable harvest, and the giant\r\nclam, /Tridacna gigas/, which measures sometimes five feet in\r\nlength. Over eight thousand species of mollusks are described from\r\nthis surpassingly rich region, yet this vast province, as compared\r\nwith the American and European shores, has been but superficially\r\nexploited by the naturalist. In whatever part of the world a\r\nnaturalist may find himself, there is always a tempting array of\r\nmolluscan life to attract him. Each fauna possesses features peculiar\r\nto itself, and from the point of view of the true naturalist, the\r\nmore somber-hued and conventionally formed mollusks of Northern\r\nshores are no less interesting than the gorgeously tinted and\r\nfantastically shaped species of the tropics. From any faunal province\r\nof our own country one may readily gather all forms necessary to\r\nfurnish ample material for study from which one may acquire an\r\nexcellent idea of the biological features of the entire phylum.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATION AND HABITS OF THE MOLLUSCA\r\n\r\nThe word \"station\" is used to indicate the nature of the surroundings\r\nwhich an animal chooses as most suited to his well-being. Some groups\r\nof mollusks, like the littorinas, the trochids, the purpuras, and the\r\nmajority of those having patelliform shells, generally live on rocks\r\nabove low-tide mark; other genera, like /Buccinum/, /Sipho/, and\r\n/Chrysodomus/, prefer rocky or gravelly ground below low-tide mark.\r\nOther mollusks burrow deep in the mud, many prefer sandy bottoms,\r\nwhile a host of other species seek homes upon the tangled masses of\r\nseaweed, living like arboreal creatures in the submarine forests.\r\nNearly every conceivable character of sea-bottom or shore-line\r\nbetween tides harbors its own peculiar types of molluscan life. There\r\nare some very curious genera of bivalves that bore their way into the\r\nhardest rock and [pg314] there find a comfortable shelter for life.\r\nA numerous class of pelagic or free-swimming mollusks supposedly\r\nnever go to the bottom at all, but spend the whole of their existence\r\non or near the surface of the sea, always in open water, where\r\ntheir fragile shells may not be injured by rough contact with solid\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nThe food of some is vegetable, of others, animal. The bivalves, like\r\nthe clams, oysters, cockles, and mussels, feed only on microscopic\r\norganisms. They create a current of water through their siphons, or\r\nmantle openings, and then, by a process best known to themselves,\r\ncatch and swallow all the animalculæ thus brought to their mouths.\r\nThe univalves which possess a siphon are, for the most part,\r\ncarnivorous, and are often most voracious creatures. They feed upon\r\nany animal matter they can find, while some of them are enabled by\r\nmeans of a sharply toothed tongue to bore through the solid shells\r\nof other mollusks and extract the succulent vitals from within. One\r\nenergetic little mollusk in particular, /Urosalpinx cinerea/, is\r\nfor this reason a great pest upon the oyster-beds. Univalves not\r\npossessed of a siphon may generally be considered herbivorous; they\r\npass most of their time peacefully browsing upon algæ.\r\n\r\nMollusks are all oviparous or ovoviviparous; that is, they lay eggs,\r\nor, laying eggs, they retain them within their shells until the\r\nyoung are hatched out. As a rule, each species of mollusk has its\r\nown particular method of protecting its eggs from external injury.\r\nSome construct tough, leathery capsules which are strung together in\r\nvarious patterns. The egg-capsules of /Purpura lapillus/, resembling\r\nlittle pinkish or yellowish club-shaped stalks, may frequently\r\nbe found in the crevices of rocks and under the rockweeds. The\r\negg-cases of /Polynices/ (/Lunatia/) are most peculiar, resembling\r\ninverted gelatine-bowls with the bottom knocked out; when wet they\r\nare semi-elastic translucent masses in which may be seen myriads of\r\neggs. /Buccinum undatum/ arranges its hemispherical egg-capsules\r\nin layers one above the other. The number of eggs so deposited is\r\noften very great, running well into the thousands. Egg-capsules of\r\n/Fulgur/ are leathery coils of angular disks adhering by one edge to\r\na connecting-band of a similar texture. (See Plate I.) [pg315]\r\n\r\nIn bivalves the eggs are retained within the parent shell until\r\nhatched, and the young, which then escape into the water, are very\r\ndifferent-looking creatures from the parent. Generally the young\r\nbivalve is free-swimming and exceedingly lively in its movements;\r\nsometimes by means of cilia it is enabled to attach itself to any\r\npassing host, and thus the species is widely disseminated. The fry\r\nsoon lose their embryonic form and take on the characteristics of the\r\nadult.\r\n\r\nThe longevity of mollusks varies greatly with the species. Some\r\nattain an age of from ten to fifteen years, while some are only\r\nannuals. Oysters continue to grow for four or five years, after\r\nwhich they may survive many years more. In truth, little is known\r\nconcerning the duration of life even of our better-known shore\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn point of intelligence, mollusks must be relegated to a very\r\nlow position. They give evidence of possessing no more than\r\nthe most primary instincts, those of self-preservation and of\r\nreproduction. There are some forms that exercise a high degree of\r\nprotective mimicry. The highest class of mollusks, the /Cephalopoda/\r\n(cuttlefishes, octopi, etc.), is widely separated from the other\r\nclasses in the development of faculties that appear to correspond\r\nwith intelligence. They are exceedingly crafty in the pursuit of\r\ntheir prey as well as in eluding capture.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF MOLLUSKS\r\n\r\nAmong the invertebrate animals, especially in the lower orders, wide\r\nphysiological departures from central or typical forms are frequent.\r\nIt often happens that a whole group or even suborder will differ\r\nso materially in its general characteristics from another group\r\nor suborder belonging to the same phylum that the student will be\r\npuzzled at first to understand how the two can be nearly related. In\r\nmany such cases it is only when the essential features of the phylum\r\nare thoroughly understood that the relationships of its suborders\r\ncan be appreciated. An example of widely divergent groups within the\r\nsame phylum has already been shown in the /Echinodermata/. Who would\r\nat first suppose that the graceful /Astrophyton/ could bear kinship\r\nto the inert [pg316] holothurian, or that both of these have the\r\nclosest family ties with the sea-urchins?\r\n\r\nThe probable reason for these startling departures from a typical\r\nform is that in the lower orders of life, where the organs and their\r\nfunctions are comparatively simple, the laws of evolution operate\r\nfar more quickly in the adaptation of an organism to environment and\r\nchanged conditions of life. A decided tendency to this departure from\r\nthe type is a feature of the mollusks. It would be difficult, if\r\nnot impossible, to give a general description that would fit both a\r\ncommon garden-snail and the common oyster, yet both are mollusks. A\r\nconcise definition of the phylum is therefore practically impossible,\r\nand it seems here as if nature resented all attempts to circumscribe\r\nher living forms by rigid rules.\r\n\r\nThe most persistent characteristic of the /Mollusca/ is the\r\npossession of the \"mantle,\" a sort of outer skin which, like a bag or\r\nsack, envelops the creature above and about the sides, but is open\r\nbelow, permitting the animal at will to protrude or withdraw its\r\nfoot. From the outer surface of this sheath-like mantle, or fold, a\r\ncalcareous shell is secreted. The modifications of this mantle are\r\ninfinite; indeed, in some well-marked groups it seems to have wholly\r\ndisappeared, having in reality become fused to the sides of the\r\nanimal, and having become therefore a mere outer skin, and no longer\r\na tunic or cloak, as originally intended. As already noted, the\r\nmantle does not always secrete a shell, a fact which again reminds us\r\nthat we cannot give a good comprehensive description of the phylum\r\nthat always holds true throughout its subdivisions. The best that can\r\nbe done is to give in general terms the characters which appear in\r\na majority of the forms. A convenient method of going about this is\r\nto create, for the sake of clearness, an ideal, model, or fanciful\r\nmollusk and clothe it with all the most salient molluscan features,\r\nand from such a basis to develop, as we go on, the various types of\r\nthe actual orders and suborders. There is one class of mollusks,\r\nthe /Amphineura/, which conforms reasonably well in most of its\r\nfeatures to our comprehension of the schematic mollusk. This class is\r\nsometimes referred to by biologists as the \"primitive\" or \"original\"\r\nmollusks, from which all the other classes have since been derived;\r\nbut the [pg317] evolutionary history of the development of the\r\nvarious molluscan orders through geological time does not seem to\r\nbear out the fact that an \"ideal\" mollusk, as we shall construct him,\r\never actually existed, or that his prototype, the /Amphineura/, was\r\nthe first and consequently the ancestral type of the phylum. We must\r\ntherefore only accept this ideal mollusk theoretically, to serve as\r\na guide for the time being. We may profitably use it only as a lay\r\nfigure--a sort of manikin, which will introduce us to the phylum.\r\nAfter our introduction we must forget our imaginary type and abandon\r\nany notion we may have conceived of the parental position of the\r\n/Amphineura/, its closest imitator in actual life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IDEAL MOLLUSK\r\n\r\nThe ideal mollusk has a compact, somewhat elongated body, the under\r\nor ventral portion of which is thickened into a muscular disk, upon\r\nwhich it creeps along. This disk is called the /foot/. (Note a snail\r\nthus crawling upon his \"foot.\") The foot is rounded or obtusely\r\npointed posteriorly. Forward, the body is slightly narrowed into\r\na neck, and then expanded again into a head. Upon this head are\r\ncarried two projecting, mobile, fleshy tentacles, one upon each\r\nside, that superficially resemble two horns. At the base of each\r\ntentacle, upon the inner side, is an eye. Just below and between the\r\ntentacles is a small horizontal slit,--the mouth,--the lips being\r\nslightly thickened. The visceral portion of the animal is above the\r\nfoot, or /dorsal/ to it, and extends the whole length of the animal\r\nfrom the mouth to the excretory opening, the latter being situated\r\nposteriorly. The visceral cavity is inclosed above by a thin skin;\r\nindeed, it is but the great thickening of this skin below that\r\nconstitutes the foot.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Ideal or schematic mollusk.\r\n\r\n  1, dorsal view: /h/, head; /t/, cephalic tentacle; /sh./, shell\r\n  covering visceral mass; /b.m./, outline of body-mass; /r.m.e./,\r\n  edge of mantle; /c.t./, ctenidia, or gills; /q.a./, generative\r\n  apertures; /r.e./, renal openings; /e.o./, excretory opening; /f/,\r\n  posterior portion of foot; /o.e.m./, edge of shell.\r\n\r\n  2, ventral view: /h/, head; /t/, tentacle; /m/, mouth; /b/, outline\r\n  of body; /e.m./, edge of mantle; /s.f./, lower surface of foot;\r\n  /c.t./, ctenidia, or gills; /f/, posterior portion of foot.\r\n\r\n  3, horizontal section, showing heart, nephridia, and gonads:\r\n  /m/, mouth; /o/, esophagus; /g/, gonad; /p/, pericardium; /n/,\r\n  nephridium, or renal organ; /v/, ventricle; /a/, auricles; /g´/,\r\n  gonad aperture; /n´/, renal opening; /e/, excretory opening; /f/,\r\n  posterior portion of foot.\r\n\r\n  4, vertical median section: /m/, mouth; /b.m./, buccal mass; /l/,\r\n  liver; /d.a./, digestive tract; /q/, gonad; /f/, foot; /q.o./,\r\n  gonad aperture, or opening of oviduct; /r.o./, renal opening;\r\n  /e.o./, end of digestive tract, excretory opening; /n/, mantle;\r\n  /r/, nephridium, or renal organ; /o.f./, recurved portion of\r\n  mantle; /sh./, shell; /v/, ventricle; /p/, pericardium.]\r\n\r\nThe digestive tract, beginning at the mouth, opens immediately into a\r\nmuscular throat, which is called the /buccal mass/. Within the buccal\r\nmass there is a long, fleshy ribbon that bears upon its upper surface\r\nnumerous rows of sharp teeth; these rows of teeth run crossways on\r\nthe ribbon, each row containing more or less prominent median teeth,\r\nwith several laterals upon each side, and with marginal teeth on each\r\nside of the laterals. This is called the /radula/, and is used for\r\ntearing or rasping the food. When [pg319] not in use it lies coiled\r\nup within the buccal mass. Beyond the buccal mass, food passes into\r\nthe esophagus, which widens out into a muscular pouch or stomach;\r\nthis may also be provided with chitinous teeth or hard knobs or\r\nplates for the purpose of further triturating the food. Above and\r\npartially surrounding the stomach is a large reddish or brownish\r\nliver, which furnishes to the alimentary canal the digestive juices.\r\nFrom the stomach the intestine leads to the terminal anal opening.\r\nThere are two organs, serving the function of kidneys, placed\r\ndorsally one upon each side of the body (/nephridia/). A heart lies\r\nwithin the median line of the body, and consists of a ventricle and\r\ntwo lateral auricles. The vascular system is almost entirely closed;\r\nonly in so far as it is partially open does it essentially differ\r\nfrom that of higher groups; the blood is whitish or light bluish,\r\nand receives its oxygenation in the gills or along the free mantle\r\nsurface, through which it courses in exceedingly thin capillaries. In\r\nthis manner respiration is carried on to some extent throughout the\r\nwhole outer surface of the body. There are two /branchiæ/ (gills).\r\nThese have the appearance of small feathers and are placed upon\r\neach side of the animal posteriorly; they project slightly. Spread\r\nover the top of this animal, fitting it perfectly, is a thin fleshy\r\ncovering attached to its dorsal portion like a skin, but hanging\r\nfree, like a flap, over the sides, the head, and the posterior end\r\nof the animal. Upon the sides it may just cover the tips of the\r\nbranchiæ, but in front the head is seen to project from under it.\r\nThe loose-hanging portion of this sac-like covering is somewhat\r\nthickened, and perhaps recurved upward upon itself. Upon the edge of\r\nthis flap all the way around may occur a row of cilia, or tentacular\r\nprocesses. This cloak-like covering is called the mantle, and, as\r\nalready noted, is the most peculiar and persistent characteristic\r\nof the /Mollusca/. The \"cavity\" formed between the loose-hanging\r\nportion of the mantle and the sides of the foot is called the /mantle\r\ncavity/, and contains posteriorly the gills, or branchiæ. From the\r\nouter surface of this mantle a calcareous secretion takes place,\r\nforming a shell, which, in our ideal mollusk, will be shaped in\r\nconformity with the surface outlines of the mantle, oblong and convex\r\nabove. Over the lower portion of the shell the edge of [pg320] the\r\nmantle recurves. When the creature is disturbed or is at complete\r\nrest it may withdraw that portion of the mantle which protrudes from\r\nbelow the shell entirely within the edge of the shell, so that the\r\n\"soft parts\" may be wholly covered, and thus protected from harm. In\r\nsuch a state of rest nothing may be seen from above but a shell. The\r\nentire upper surface of the mantle is firmly attached to the under or\r\ninner side of the shell, except the mantle margin, this being free.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system consists of a circumesophageal ring of\r\nnerve-cells, with two cords passing along the digestive tract to the\r\nposterior end of the animal. In the head and above the buccal mass\r\nare several series of nerve-ganglia. These also communicate with the\r\nposterior portion of the animal through two parallel cords which pass\r\nalong its ventral side. From these four principal branches, which\r\ntraverse the entire length of the creature, minor nerve-cords are\r\nthrown off to the tentacles, the foot, the branchiæ, and the various\r\norgans of the viscera. The sexes are separate.\r\n\r\nReviewing our \"typical mollusk,\" we find that it is bilaterally\r\nsymmetrical--that is, uniform upon both sides of a median line from\r\nmouth to excretory opening; is unsegmented; has the ventral surface\r\nthickened into a creeping foot or disk; and is possessed of a head\r\nwith tentacular processes, a radula, lateral branchiæ, a heart with a\r\nventricle and two auricles, a well-developed mantle, and a shell.\r\n\r\nIf the reader can learn these few details of organization he knows\r\nthe structure of a mollusk. In turning to the actual living forms he\r\nwill find merely modifications (though sometimes confusing ones) of\r\nthese various parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION\r\n\r\nThe /Mollusca/ are divided into five great classes: /Amphineura/,\r\n/Gasteropoda/, /Scaphopoda/, /Pelecypoda/, and /Cephalopoda/. These\r\nnames, it will be noticed, with the exception of the first, all refer\r\nto the /foot/, the modifications of the foot being selected as the\r\nbasis of the first great divisions of the phylum. The /Gasteropoda/\r\ncrawl upon the thickened ventral surface of their bodies (already\r\n[pg321] referred to as the foot), as the common garden-snail, the\r\nperiwinkles, and in general all those mollusks which have a spirally\r\ncoiled shell. The /Scaphopoda/ have a long, worm-like foot, with\r\nwhich they burrow in the sand or mud. Their shells are like miniature\r\nelephant-tusks, but are open at both ends. The /Pelecypoda/ have a\r\nmore or less club-shaped foot, utilized, in the many families, for\r\na great variety of purposes. They are always inclosed in a bivalve\r\nshell. Familiar examples are the oysters, the clams, mussels, etc.\r\nThe /Cephalopoda/ have the /foot/ modified into a number of /arms/,\r\nwhich encircle the head or the mouth. They are the cuttlefishes, the\r\noctopi, squids, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS =AMPHINEURA=\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =POLYPLACOPHORA=\r\n\r\nThe /Amphineura/, as already observed, approach most closely to the\r\nideal mollusk just described. They are bilaterally symmetrical.\r\nThis fact is so important that it constitutes them a class,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that in respect to the foot (the basis of\r\ndivision into classes) they would be included with the /Gasteropoda/,\r\nfor (barring some exceptional instances) they creep along upon a foot\r\nquite as our ideal mollusk would, and as the /Gasteropoda/ do. The\r\nhead carries no tentacles, thus essentially differing in this respect\r\nfrom the ideal form. The mantle is extended down in front, completely\r\ncovering the head. The branchiæ are confined to a few pairs of\r\n/ctenidia/, or plume-like gills, within the mantle groove or cavity,\r\nand are arranged upon each side of the excretory opening like small\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nThere are two orders of the /Amphineura/, the /Polyplacophora/ and\r\nthe /Aplacophora/ (or /Solenogastres/), the one name meaning \"bearing\r\nmany plates,\" and the other \"without plates,\" the word \"plate\" in\r\nthis sense being synonymous with \"shell.\" The shell of the first\r\norder consists of eight calcareous disks arranged in a longitudinal\r\nrow along the back or dorsal side of the animal, which overlap like\r\nshingles on a roof and admit of great variation of form in the\r\nvarious families. [pg322]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed from the examples given that the shell plates do\r\nnot entirely cover the mantle, but that a considerable portion of the\r\nupper mantle surface is left exposed along the side of the animal.\r\nThis exposed portion of the mantle is called the /girdle/. It is\r\nalways very much thickened and is often exceedingly tough. In some\r\nspecies it is covered by a great number of calcareous spicules or\r\ngranules which are embedded in the leathery mantle tissue. Strangely\r\nenough, the /Chitonidæ/ (a large family of the /Polyplacophora/)\r\npossess a great number of eyes scattered over the shell plates like\r\nminute dots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Chiton spinosus/, dorsal view.]\r\n\r\nThe members of this order are to be found in all parts of the world,\r\nbut their greatest development is upon the west coast of America.\r\nIn California the student of marine life has a splendid opportunity\r\nto examine the chitons. They are generally to be found adhering\r\nto the under surface of stones about low-tide mark. They are very\r\nsluggish in their movements and may readily be removed from their\r\nresting-places by suddenly thrusting a knife-blade under the foot\r\nand prying them off. When thus detached they have a habit of rolling\r\nup into a ball and so remaining indefinitely; to prevent this they\r\nshould be placed at once in a jar of sea-water, where they will\r\nresume their natural position. For preservation as cabinet specimens,\r\nchitons should be tied down between two boards or flat substances,\r\nto hold them firmly extended until dried; otherwise they are apt to\r\ncontract out of shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:/Chiton/, ventral view: /an/, anus; /cten/, ctenidia;\r\n/ft/, foot; /mant/, mantle-edge; /mo/, mouth.]\r\n\r\nSix or eight species are exceedingly common upon the west [pg323]\r\ncoast. The collector who has successfully taken a number of these\r\nwill not fail to note the varying degrees of width of the girdle in\r\nthe different species. In some cases the girdle partially covers the\r\noverlapping shell plates. The largest of all the chitons inhabits\r\nthe California shores and is known as ^Cryptochiton stelleri^.\r\nIt measures fully six inches in length and three in width. In\r\n/Cryptochiton/ the girdle is continued over the shell plates as a\r\ntough, gritty, brownish covering. The shell plates are white, and,\r\nas detached pieces, are frequently to be found cast up upon the\r\nCalifornia beaches, where, from their curious shape, they are often\r\nreferred to as \"butterfly-shells.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Chiton ruber./ /Chiton apiculatus./]\r\n\r\nOn the east coast of America there are comparatively few species, and\r\nthese are all small and inconspicuous. The three commonest ones are\r\n^Chiton ruber^, ^C. albus^, and ^C. apiculatus^. They may readily be\r\nfound on stones or dead shells fished up from below low-tide mark, or\r\nin rock-pools left by the receding tide.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =APLACOPHORA=\r\n\r\nThis second order of the /Amphineura/ is entirely destitute of the\r\nshell plates characteristic of the first. The outer mantle surface,\r\nhowever, develops a number of calcareous granules which correspond to\r\na shell. The /Aplacophora/ are symmetrical, having the mouth and the\r\nexcretory opening at the anterior and posterior ends respectively.\r\nThe foot is greatly modified, being narrowed at times to a mere slit\r\nalong the ventral surface. Some of them have long, worm-like bodies.\r\nThis is no doubt a very primitive form of mollusk, or, if not a\r\nprimitive form, it has greatly degenerated from some higher type.\r\nThey are supposed to be commensal in habit and live in the deeper\r\nwater offshore.\r\n\r\nThe /Aplacophora/ are not littoral animals, and it is extremely\r\nunlikely that one will ever encounter them upon the beach, unless,\r\npossibly, after the severest of storms. We may therefore leave them\r\nwith this mere mention and proceed to the second class of mollusks,\r\nthe /Gasteropoda/.

As a class it\r\npossesses all the most characteristic features of the phylum, though\r\nit is frequently modified in a high degree. This class includes\r\nall the univalve mollusks (except /Nautilus/ and /Dentalia/), such\r\nas the snails, the whelks, and the host of spirally coiled land,\r\nfresh-water, and marine shells.\r\n\r\nThe gasteropod foot is, as has been remarked, primarily the same\r\nas in our schematic mollusk--a flat, muscular disk caused by\r\nthe thickening of the ventral body-surface. The neck, head, and\r\ntentacles are also quite the same, but considerable modification\r\nof these organs will be found when we come to examine some\r\nspecimens. The mantle is always present, except in the nudibranch\r\nor non-shell-bearing forms; but in few of the /Gasteropoda/ is the\r\nmantle so regularly simple as in our ideal mollusk.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking feature of the /Gasteropoda/, and\r\none that will at first surprise him who has in mind the simple\r\nstructure of the ideal mollusk, is the fact that they are always\r\nasymmetrical--that is to say, a median line drawn longitudinally\r\nthrough a gasteropod will not divide it into halves of similar\r\nanatomical structure.\r\n\r\nThe quality of symmetry is an important one throughout the lower\r\norders of animal life. In nearly all phyletic or class descriptions\r\nthe word \"symmetry\" occurs, and its exact meaning must be understood.\r\nTake, for example, a human being; a median line drawn vertically\r\nwould divide him into two similar halves--upon each side would be\r\nan eye, an arm, a leg, etc., of similar shape and construction. So\r\nfar at least as the external features [pg329] go, man is then a\r\nsymmetrical creature; likewise the vertebrates in general. Cases\r\nof actual symmetry are found in the lobsters and crabs and in the\r\nsegmented worms. It is usual in describing mollusks broadly and in\r\ngeneral terms to call them symmetrical animals, yet here is the\r\nlargest class within the phylum, whose representatives are none of\r\nthem symmetrical. In the /Gasteropoda/ the mouth is anteriorly placed\r\nin the head, just as in the ideal form, but the digestive tract,\r\nafter traversing the visceral cavity in the usual fashion, suddenly\r\nturns forward and terminates in an excretory opening either on the\r\nright or on the left side of the animal, just back of the head. The\r\nvarious other orifices for the genital and renal glands are also\r\nplaced in this unexpected anterior position. The gills, or branchiæ,\r\nare to be found upon one side only, forward of the heart, and\r\ndiffer somewhat in appearance from the plume-like processes of the\r\n/Amphineura/.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, has become of the corresponding gill we should expect to\r\nfind on the other side? The symmetrical shape of the foot is not in\r\nthe least altered, but what has happened to cause this distortion of\r\nthe visceral portion of the animal? And, finally, will this torsion\r\nof the body of the snail perhaps account for the spiral nature of the\r\nshell?\r\n\r\nAn evolutionary process is supposed to have taken place in mollusks,\r\nwhich, if real, would no doubt account for these curious conditions\r\nof torsion in the /Gasteropoda/; but the theory upon which this\r\nprocess is based is altogether speculative, and is not fully\r\nsustained by the facts in the case. Originally all mollusks are\r\npresumed to have been symmetrical, and are assumed to have resembled\r\nvery much in form the schematic creature we have already described.\r\nNow, for some reason, certain of the primitive mollusks, but not all\r\nof them, began to develop a larger visceral mass, which, continuing\r\nto enlarge throughout many generations, began finally to protrude\r\nabove and form a hump on the dorsal side of the animal. This hump,\r\ncontaining the liver, a portion of the intestines, and the generative\r\nglands, as it increased in bulk became so much elevated that it could\r\nno longer maintain itself in an erect position over the body, but,\r\nimpelled by its own [pg330] weight, began to sag over to one side.\r\nSuch a process would of course tend to twist the digestive tract and\r\nbring the excretory opening constantly farther forward on one side.\r\nAt the same time, this process would necessarily interfere, by the\r\nweight of the overhanging viscera and the shell covering the mass,\r\nwith the development of the branchiæ lying upon that side and now\r\ncrowded under the visceral mass. Thus, according to this theory, this\r\nprocess has continued until, in the modern gasteropod, the digestive\r\ntract has been bent upon itself and twisted from a straight course\r\ninto a curve of almost 180°, bringing the excretory opening near or\r\njust over the head, where it empties into the mantle cavity; while\r\nthe original right gill, by the same movement, has been brought to a\r\nposition on the /left/ side of the head, forward of the heart, the\r\noriginal left gill having been crowded out, eventually to atrophy and\r\ndisappear. The same torsion is found in the nerve-cords; the heart,\r\nsituated at about the pivotal position of this twisting process,\r\nhas turned about upon itself, leaving an auricle in front of the\r\nventricle, one auricle, like one of the gills, having been lost. The\r\nmantle portion covering the visceral hump naturally continued to\r\nsecrete its shell, though always in conformity with the change, the\r\nresult being the familiar spiral form of the usual gasteropod shell.\r\n\r\nThis theory may not be satisfactory, but the asymmetry of gasteropods\r\nis a problem to be solved, and a more interesting line of biological\r\ninvestigation could not be found.\r\n\r\nLet us now take a good example of a gasteropod and locate its various\r\norgans; at the same time we may use the occasion to refer to more\r\nimportant modifications of these organs which will be encountered\r\nlater in the various genera. The most available gasteropod on the\r\neast coast of the United States for this purpose, is /Fulgur/, both\r\non account of its large size and its abundance. /Buccinum/ may be\r\nused if the student is north of Cape Cod and therefore unable to\r\nsecure a good living specimen of /Fulgur/; the anatomical differences\r\nbetween the two are slight.\r\n\r\nNote the siphon protruding forward from a notch in the shell. This\r\nconsists merely in an elongation of a fold of the mantle, which is\r\nheld in a manner to constitute a tube, through which [pg331] the\r\nanimal draws in water to supply the gills, lying just back of the\r\nsiphon and concealed under the mantle in the cavity already spoken\r\nof as the mantle cavity. With the exception of that portion of the\r\nmantle which constitutes the siphon, no part of its margin, it will\r\nbe observed, can be seen, the edge of the shell completely hiding it\r\nfrom view.\r\n\r\nIn some genera the siphon is exceedingly long--in fact, longer than\r\nthe body of the animal. In these cases the mollusk is generally fond\r\nof burying itself in the sand and maintaining communication with\r\nthe world above only by means of this long, fleshy tube. In some\r\ngenera the siphon is protected by an elongation of the shell, as in\r\n/Fasciolaria/ (Plate LXXVI). An extreme example of this is given in\r\nthe figure on page 343, which represents a species of /Murex/, where\r\nthe siphon is not only protected by the shell, but the shell itself\r\nis further protected by the double row of sharp spines with which it\r\nis beset.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Buccinum undatum/: /si/, siphon.]\r\n\r\nThere are some genera which possess no siphons at all, in all of\r\nwhich cases there is no notch in the shell opening, the aperture\r\nbeing round, as in /Natica/ and in /Littorina/ (pages 368, 371). The\r\nmollusks of this type make a fold in the forward part of the mantle\r\nwhich serves as a siphon. Such a muscular folding in the mantle would\r\nbe technically called a /functional siphon/.\r\n\r\nOn the posterior dorsal side of the foot is attached a horny plate,\r\nof concentric structure about a central or subcentral point or\r\nnucleus. This is called the /operculum/, and serves to close the\r\nentrance of the shell when the animal is withdrawn, the object no\r\ndoubt being protective. The opercula vary to a great extent in the\r\ndifferent genera; in some cases they are calcareous, in others\r\ncartilaginous. When the aperture of the shell is very large it often\r\nhappens that the operculum does not entirely close the opening, as\r\nin /Fulgur/, but in /Buccinum/ it is a close fit. The operculum is\r\nentirely wanting in the /Pulmonata/, one of the [pg332] large orders\r\nof the /Gasteropoda/. The figures represent some of the commoner\r\ntypes of opercula.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Various forms of opercula. /Turbo/ (/Sarmaticus/).\r\n/Turbo/ (/Callopoma/). /Livona./ /Ampullaria./ /Natica./ ]\r\n\r\nThe opercula have been utilized a great deal in the classification\r\nof the /Gasteropoda/, and especially in some groups that have become\r\nterrestrial in habit. Often, when shell-characters utterly fail to\r\ngive a clue to the proper generic position of a new or rare mollusk,\r\nthe operculum may be relied upon to indicate it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Various forms of opercula. /Pyrula./ /Purpura./\r\n/Littorina./ /Aulopoma./ /Torinia./ /Neritopsis./ /Strombus./\r\n/Conus./]\r\n\r\n\r\nTENTACLES\r\n\r\nTwo tentacles project like fleshy horns from the sides of the head.\r\nThese are not retractile, as in the land-snails, and their office\r\nappears to be that of sensory organs. In both /Fulgur/ and /Buccinum/\r\nthe tentacles are comparatively short and stout, and have expanded\r\nbases; in many other genera they are long and slender. Almost without\r\nexception the /Gasteropoda/ possess tentacles. [pg333]\r\n\r\n\r\nEYES\r\n\r\nIn /Fulgur/ the eyes are situated near the bases and upon the outer\r\nsides of the tentacles; in /Buccinum/ they are extremely small and\r\nare mounted about midway between the bases and the tips of the\r\ntentacles. This is the usual position for the eyes in the marine\r\n/Gasteropoda/. Only in the pulmonates, or land-snails, are the eyes\r\nplaced at the summit of the tentacles. Sight does not appear to be\r\na very important sense in the gasteropods, although the eye in some\r\ninstances becomes a highly developed organ. A number of forms that\r\nhave the habit of burrowing deep into the sand or mud are quite\r\ndestitute of visual organs, and certain cave-dwelling land-shells\r\nhave entirely lost the sense of vision.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUTH AND PROBOSCIS\r\n\r\nThe mouth will easily be seen in both /Fulgur/ and /Buccinum/. It is\r\na small slit with slightly thickened, fleshy lips, and is placed on\r\nthe lower forward portion of the head. In the case of both of these\r\ngenera the mouth is situated at the end of a proboscis. It will be\r\nnoted that /Fulgur/ has a comparatively long and stout proboscis, or\r\nsnout, which is not retractile. /Buccinum/ has a smaller one. It is\r\nfairly safe to assume that all gasteropods that possess a proboscis\r\nare carnivorous. This organ is greatly developed in some genera,\r\nwhere it actually exceeds in length the rest of the animal. In such\r\ninstances, no doubt, the creature is enabled to reach the interior\r\nportions of the shells of its victims and to devour every vestige\r\nof their flesh, for the mouth is most conveniently placed just at\r\nthe end of this long, trunk-like organ. The genera which have no\r\nproboscis are, almost without exception, vegetable feeders.\r\n\r\nWe must now remove the animal from its shell. It is well to boil\r\nit first, for this does away with the annoying mucous secretion\r\nthat is freely exuded by glands in the foot when the creature is\r\nroughly handled. Alcoholic specimens are apt to be much contracted\r\nand hardened, and are therefore less satisfactory as subjects for\r\nanatomical study. If it is not convenient to boil the [pg334]\r\nspecimen, break away the shell with a hammer, using care not to\r\nlacerate the soft, fleshy portion within; when this is accomplished,\r\nwash the animal carefully to remove the slimy exudation. Note the\r\n\"visceral hump,\" which is spiral, and which formerly occupied the\r\nupper-whorl portion of the shell. The thin skin covering it is the\r\nmantle, which below is greatly thickened and free, lying about the\r\nfoot like a heavy fleshy flap.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANTLE\r\n\r\nThe mantle-edge in both of these examples is simple; that is to say,\r\nit possesses no fringe of tentacles, nor is it supplemented by extra\r\nprocesses, characters which mark many genera of marine /Gasteropoda/.\r\nIn /Fulgur/ and /Buccinum/ the mantle-edge does not protrude below\r\nthe edge of the shell; but in many genera, especially those which\r\npossess smooth, glossy shells, like the cowries (/Cypræa/) and the\r\ngraceful /Oliva/, the mantle is proportionately very much larger. In\r\nthese two genera, when the animal is extended, as in crawling about\r\nthe sand, the mantle curves upward and incloses a large portion of\r\nthe shell itself. Indeed, in some genera the shell is almost entirely\r\nconcealed by this extension of the mantle (/Sigaretus/, /Natica/,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\nWhen the shell is removed, the folding of the mantle which\r\nconstitutes the siphon can be plainly seen. The office of the siphon\r\nhas already been referred to, also the fact that the presence of a\r\nsiphon in the gasteropod mollusk may always be determined by merely\r\nglancing at the shell alone, for a notch at the base of the aperture\r\nindicates the place through which the siphon passed. In /Buccinum/\r\nthis is merely a notch, but in /Fulgur/ the siphonal canal of the\r\nshell is much longer. Just why the long siphons of some mollusks\r\nshould be naked and exposed to danger, while others are so carefully\r\nprotected by elongated, portions of the shell, is a mystery, but\r\nnature is full of such contradictions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GASTEROPOD FOOT\r\n\r\nThe foot is long, broad, and flat on the under side, like a disk.\r\nThe variations in the gasteropod foot are almost infinite. [pg335]\r\nIn some of the species it is amazingly large and powerful, as\r\nin /Polynices/ (/Natica/), and in most of the forms which live\r\nalong sandy beaches. These are sometimes provided in front with a\r\nwedge-shaped process called the /propodium/, which serves admirably\r\nas a plow to push aside the heavy wet sand through which the animal\r\nforces its way. In /Nassa/, which is so common all along our coasts,\r\nthe foot has two terminal appendages or points behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Sigaretus l[oe]vigatus/, showing excessive\r\ndevelopment of the propodium (/pr./) and metapodium (/met./) in a\r\nmollusk living in sand (the shell, which covers only the liver and\r\nadjacent parts, has been removed): /l/, liver; /s. ap./, aperture of\r\nproboscis, here deflected from the median line; /t/, /t/, tentacles;\r\n/f/, foot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Oliva textilina/ showing how the front part of the\r\nfoot (/f/) is developed into a sort of fender, the propodium (/pr./):\r\n/e/, /e/, eyes; /m. ap./, front appendage of mantle; /m. ap.´/,\r\nhinder appendage of mantle, folded into the suture when the animal is\r\nat rest; /si./, siphon; /t/, /t/, tentacles.]\r\n\r\nThere is no single feature of mollusks more important than the foot,\r\nfor upon the many modifications of this organ the various molluscan\r\nclasses are founded. The name /Gasteropoda/ means \"stomach-foot,\"\r\nthe latter organ being merely a thickening of [pg336] the ventral\r\nsurface of the animal, giving to the creature, when active, the\r\nappearance of crawling upon its stomach.\r\n\r\nIf a living gasteropod is placed in a jar of sea-water and left\r\nundisturbed it will soon crawl up the side of the glass and thus\r\nafford an excellent view of the extended under surface of its foot.\r\nThe majority of the gasteropods are lethargic and slow in movement,\r\nbut others will be found to be exceedingly lively and able to creep\r\nup the sides of the jar and make their escape in a surprisingly short\r\ntime. Further modifications of the foot will be mentioned later.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANTLE CAVITY\r\n\r\nNow let us place the animal with the foot below and the head facing\r\nus. The spiral visceral hump will point back and away from the\r\nobserver. The mantle covering the visceral portion is thin and\r\ntranslucent like an ordinary skin, but at the base of the visceral\r\nmass the mantle suddenly thickens very greatly, and spreads over\r\nthe dorsal portion of the foot or the body like a cloak. The space\r\nbetween the body and the loose-lying mantle is called the /mantle\r\ncavity/, and within this area are to be found several important\r\nexternal organs. To find these it is well to cut the mantle flap in\r\na straight line, beginning just back of the head and ending at the\r\npoint where the mantle is attached to the body. This will most easily\r\nbe done with scissors. Having thus divided the mantle in front, throw\r\nback the two flaps. On the right-hand side (left of the animal), and\r\nattached to the inner side of the mantle thus exposed, will be seen\r\nthe branchiæ, or gills.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRANCHIÆ, OR GILLS\r\n\r\nThey consist of a row of flattened filaments bound together at the\r\nbase like the leaves of a book. The blood is conveyed to these\r\ngills by a large vein, and is then forced through the thinly walled\r\nfilaments, being thus brought into close contact with the water, to\r\nwhich it releases its carbon dioxide, and from which it receives the\r\nlife-giving oxygen. In certain gasteropods there are two sets of\r\ngills, one placed upon each side of the body [pg338] (as in the\r\nideal mollusk); but the presence of two sets of gills only indicates,\r\nin these gasteropods, that the twisting process of the viscera,\r\nalready alluded to as so remarkable a feature of this class, has not\r\nproceeded far enough to destroy the functional activity of one of the\r\ngills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anatomy of the internal organs of a female gasteropod,\r\nviewed from the dorsal side. The roof of the mantle cavity has been\r\ndivided by a longitudinal incision and the flaps laid out, that on\r\nthe left bearing the ctenidium and osphradium, and that on the right\r\nthe rectum and terminal part of the oviduct. The muscular dorsal wall\r\nof the body and the introvert have been divided so as to bring into\r\nview the anterior part of the alimentary canal and a portion of the\r\nnervous system. The buccal cavity has been tilted up and opened so\r\nas to show the odontophore, and the esophagus has been cut through\r\nnear the anterior end. A portion of the ventral wall of the crop\r\nhas been removed so as to bring the internal folds into view, and\r\nthe interior of the nephridium with the contained portion of the\r\nintestine has been exposed.

Whether the breathing is effected by gills or by\r\na pulmonary sac, the essential features of the system are the same\r\nas in fishes or mammals. There are, however, some rather peculiar\r\ndevelopments in the breathing system of gasteropods that are worthy\r\nof notice. The gills themselves differ throughout the various orders\r\nof this class both as to their structure and their relative position;\r\nin one of the orders (the /Pulmonata/) the gills have entirely\r\ndisappeared, and are replaced by a pulmonary sac which fulfils the\r\npurpose of a lung.\r\n\r\nIt is a generally accepted theory that all land or air-breathing\r\nmollusks were originally marine, but by a gradual change in their\r\nhabits have developed into terrestrial forms, losing their gills\r\nand acquiring in their place organs which correspond to lungs. The\r\ntheory is supported by the fact that many species of marine mollusks\r\nlive between tide-marks, and for several hours daily are obliged to\r\nmaintain life outside of their native element. The /Littorinidæ/,\r\nwhich may always be found in abundance on both the east and the west\r\nAmerican coasts, usually live high above low-tide line, and some\r\ntropical species of this genus actually live in the trees above\r\nthe reach of high tide. They have gills just as in /Buccinum/ or\r\n/Fulgur/, but the /Littorina/ shell is strongly suggestive of certain\r\nland forms, and there is reason to believe that the genus is in\r\ncourse of evolution into a pulmonate. On the other hand, there are to\r\nbe found in fresh water numerous genera which are true pulmonates,\r\nand which are obliged to come to the surface every few minutes to\r\nobtain air. One notable genus of marine gasteropods possesses both\r\nlungs and gills, and one marine form has entirely lost its gills\r\nand breathes only by means of lungs. It is quite likely that all\r\nmollusks are able to breathe more or less all along the exposed\r\nmantle surface, which is usually [pg339] crowded with capillaries\r\nwith exceedingly thin walls. This very remarkable method of surface\r\nrespiration is proved to exist in the nudibranch or shell-less marine\r\n/Gasteropoda/, for they possess neither gills nor lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSPHRADIUM\r\n\r\nLying just under the gills, and side by side with them, is a smaller,\r\nplume-like organ having the appearance of a smaller gill; it is\r\ncalled the /osphradium/. The office of this organ is not definitely\r\nknown, but the supposition is that it is the seat of the olfactory\r\nnerves. The osphradia are not always present, but whenever found they\r\nare placed in close conjunction with the gills, in order, probably,\r\nthat the animal may best determine the quality of the water brought\r\nby the siphon to the breathing-organs. In /Buccinum/ the osphradium\r\nis especially prominent. In all mollusks the sense of smell is highly\r\ndeveloped. A dead animal anchored to the bottom will very soon\r\nattract the carnivorous /Mollusca/ from every direction. This is not\r\na bad way to trap certain species that live upon rocky stations and\r\nare otherwise difficult to secure by the dredge.\r\n\r\nOn the left-hand side (right of the animal), and adhering to the\r\nunder side of the mantle flap, which has been thrown back, a somewhat\r\ninflated and convoluted tube, the rectum, will be seen. It terminates\r\nin an opening just within the mantle-edge. By the side of this are\r\nthe renal and genital openings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving now examined the external organs, we may investigate the\r\ninternal anatomy of our subject. To do this thoroughly requires\r\nconsiderable skill, but for the purpose of merely discovering the\r\nrelative positions of the principal internal organs a little care\r\nonly is necessary. The work will be greatly facilitated by boiling\r\nthe animal for a few minutes, for this serves to harden the tissues\r\nand to separate the various organs in a most satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nTo begin, open the proboscis from the mouth, cutting back so as to\r\nexpose the esophagus. It will be seen that the throat is long and\r\nvery muscular. [pg340]\r\n\r\n\r\nRADULA\r\n\r\nHidden among the red stripes of muscular fiber which line the inner\r\nsurface of the throat will be found a fleshy strip covered upon\r\none side with many transverse rows of chitinous teeth. This is the\r\n/lingual ribbon/, or /radula/. Remove as much of it as possible, and\r\nexamine it with a hand-glass. The radula is a most important organ,\r\nand is a unique possession of /Mollusca/, except the pelecypods, or\r\nbivalves. Usually it lies coiled up like a spiral when not in use;\r\nits purpose is to tear and rasp food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three rows of teeth from the radula of /Fasciolaria\r\ntrapezium/.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portion of the radula of /Imbricaria marmorata/.]\r\n\r\nThe radula has been the subject of much study by conchologists, and\r\nhas furnished the basis for an arrangement of the numerous sections\r\nof gasteropods into somewhat well-defined groups. If the observer has\r\na strong glass he will notice that each transverse row of teeth on\r\nthe ribbon consists of a median or central tooth with several points\r\nor \"cusps.\" /Fulgur/ has a median tooth with three cusps; /Buccinum/\r\none with six. On each side of the median tooth is a lateral tooth,\r\nwhich in /Fulgur/ will be seen to have six cusps, and in /Buccinum/\r\nfive. In many patterns of radulæ there is, besides the median and\r\nlateral teeth, still another paired row, called the marginals. In\r\nthe accompanying figures are given some examples which show small\r\nsections of lingual ribbons. While all the radulæ of mollusks are\r\ncapable of being grouped by their general characteristics, yet in no\r\ntwo species of mollusks are the radulæ quite identical. [pg341]\r\n\r\n\r\nVITAL ORGANS, STOMACH, LIVER, RENAL GLANDS, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe digestive tract will be found to widen out a short distance back\r\ninto a crop or stomach, and, continuing still further, to lose itself\r\nin a soft, brownish mass within the coiled spire, which is the liver.\r\nThe very large size of the liver leads one to suspect that /Fulgur/\r\nand /Buccinum/ must be voracious creatures to need so large an organ\r\nfor the secretion of bile. In many species of mollusks the stomach\r\nand intestines are filled quite solidly, at times, with a gelatinous\r\ntransparent substance called the /crystalline stylet/. Just why the\r\ndigestive tract should be clogged with this substance no one has\r\nyet been able to explain, so here again is a chance for original\r\ninvestigation. The intestine curves about after reaching the liver,\r\nand comes forward again to appear once more as the rectum, clinging\r\nto the inner surface of the free portion of the mantle.\r\n\r\nClosely associated with the liver, but differing slightly in color,\r\nis the gonad, or organ in which the genital products are formed.\r\nSituated dorsally and forward of the liver and gonad is a large renal\r\ngland, which may readily be detected by its peculiar structure. In\r\nsome forms the kidney is closely associated with the gonad, and seems\r\nto coöperate with the latter in the generative functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEART AND VASCULAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\nTo find the heart, make an incision into the body just at the\r\nposterior end of the gills. The heart is white and round, and\r\nis inclosed within a cavity known as the /pericardium/; it has\r\na ventricle and one or two auricles, although in /Buccinum/ and\r\n/Fulgur/ there is but one auricle.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing remarkable about the vascular system to distinguish\r\nit from that of many higher forms of animals. It is, however, not\r\ncompletely closed--by which is meant that the blood is not always\r\ncontained within arteries or veins, and that it does sometimes flow\r\ninto other organs and floods certain other body-cavities, although\r\nthe vascular system of mollusks is by no means so completely open as\r\nis that of insects and crustaceans. [pg342]\r\n\r\nHaving examined the animal which inhabits the shell and gained an\r\nidea of its anatomy, we may now turn to an inspection of the house\r\nwhich it has built for itself, and here we shall find a delightful\r\nsubject for study.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GASTEROPOD SHELL\r\n\r\nAn industrious hour of collecting upon almost any beach will provide\r\nthe student with an abundance of interesting shells. Putting aside\r\nthe bivalves, the univalve or gasteropod shells remaining should be\r\nclosely examined for the purpose of becoming acquainted with their\r\nvarious conchological features. The collector will see at once that\r\nhe has a number of species that differ more or less widely in their\r\ngeneral form, size, texture, and sculpture. Some shells will be long\r\nin proportion to their width, with many turns of the spire which\r\nprobably terminates in a sharply pointed apex; others will be almost\r\nround, with comparatively few spiral turns which end in a blunt apex,\r\ngiving to the specimen outlines suggestive of a dome. A wide range of\r\ncharacters will be found in the mouths or apertures of the shells,\r\nsome being almost if not quite round, others oblong and with a notch\r\ncut into the lower portion of the opening, and others possibly with\r\nthis notch extended into a sort of semi-inclosed channel. A first\r\nlesson in classification of the /Mollusca/ may be taken by dividing\r\nthe results of the first day's collecting of univalve shells into\r\ngroups according to these prominent shell-characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parts of a gasteropod shell: /a/, anterior canal; /b/,\r\nbody-whorl; /c/, columella; /l/, outer lip; /m/, mouth or aperture;\r\n/p/, posterior canal; /s/, sutures; /sp/, spire; /u/, umbilicus.]\r\n\r\nA good knowledge of the parts of a gasteropod shell is essential to\r\nthe student, and it can readily be acquired. Four specimens are given\r\nin the accompanying figures, representing highly divergent [pg343]\r\ntypes of marine gasteropods, and their respective characteristics may\r\nbe noted by comparing them one with another: /Fasciolaria tulipa/\r\n(Plate LXXVI.), a Floridian shell; /Polynices heros/, a common\r\nspecies found on all the sandy shores of the American Atlantic\r\ncoast; /Murex tenuispina/, an Indo-Pacific species much prized by\r\ncollectors; and /Acmæa testudinalis/, commonly found in Maine and\r\nMassachusetts at low tide clinging to rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Polynices heros/; /Acmæa testudinalis/, from below;\r\n/Acmæa testudinalis/, profile; /Murex tenuispina/.]\r\n\r\nThe extreme top of the shell is called the /apex/, and it may be\r\neither sharply pointed or obtuse. Each turn is called a /whorl/; the\r\nlast one, and always the largest, is called the /body-whorl/, the\r\nothers collectively forming the /spire/ of the shell. When the animal\r\nfirst emerges from the egg it is always provided with one or two\r\nwhorls, which generally may be distinguished at the apex as smoother\r\nthan the rest of the spire, and a faint line may be discovered where\r\nthe shell began its growth after birth. These [pg344] first whorls\r\nof embryonic growth are usually referred to as the /nepionic whorls/.\r\nThe interstices between the successive whorls are called /sutures/,\r\nand these lines of juncture may be shallow or deep according to the\r\nconvexity of the whorls. The sculpturing of the whorls is often\r\nof great complexity, and exhibits /nodules/, /varices/, /ribs/,\r\n/revolving striæ/, /spinous processes/, and /lines of growth/.\r\nIt frequently happens that there is a complete absence of any\r\nsculpturing whatever, the whole surface of the shell being perfectly\r\nsmooth, save for the faint lines of growth to be detected only under\r\na magnifying-glass. The outer edge of the mouth or aperture of the\r\nshell is called the /outer lip/. This may be more or less thickened,\r\nexpanded, or simple. The inner lip is called the /columella/, and may\r\nbe greatly extended anteriorly. When the mouth of the shell is round,\r\nand there is no notch or indentation either above or below, it is\r\nsaid to be /continuous/.\r\n\r\nThe /anterior canal/ is for the accommodation of the siphon of the\r\nanimal, which, as noted above, may be very long or almost entirely\r\nabsent; therefore the character of the shell generally indicates\r\nwhether or not the animal itself possesses a long siphon. There is in\r\nsome forms a notch at the upper extremity of the mouth, which is for\r\nthe accommodation of the anal discharges. When present it is called\r\nthe /posterior canal/.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that all the specimens figured as examples, save\r\none, are spiral, the coils revolving about an imaginary axis. When\r\nthe whorls are not too closely coiled there is left open to the view\r\na hollow space throughout the entire length of the shell, which is\r\ncalled the /umbilicus/. When the coils of the shell are very compact\r\nthere is no umbilicus to be seen. The umbilical opening may be very\r\nlarge, giving a clear view of the inner surfaces of all the whorls\r\nright through to the apex. The usual gasteropod shell is in reality a\r\nhollow tube wound about an imaginary axis. Since the tube increases\r\nin size as it progresses, the base of the shell is necessarily\r\nwider and larger than the apex. Thus all gasteropod shells may be\r\nreduced in shape to the single type of a cone or top, modified by\r\nthe excessive length or shortness of the spire, or otherwise altered\r\nby special peculiarities. In /Polynices duplicata/ (page 368), it\r\nwill be observed that while the [pg345] umbilicus is fairly large,\r\nits external opening, in the adult shell, has been almost completely\r\nclosed by a callous process thrown off from the inner or columellar\r\nlip.\r\n\r\nGasteropod shells may be /sinistral/ or /dextral/, according as\r\nthe whorls turn to the left or right. The great majority of marine\r\nspecies are dextral, having the opening on the right, although a\r\nfew species exhibit the curious property of being constructed upon\r\neither the one or the other plan without apparent reason. Sinistral\r\nspecimens of many normally dextral species have been discovered, but\r\nthey are so rare as to warrant the belief that such specimens are\r\nmerely deformities or monstrosities resulting from some accident of\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nThe collector will soon learn to distinguish between young and adult\r\nspecimens, for those finishing touches of wonder and beauty which\r\nthe mollusk gives to his protective covering are made only by the\r\nadult. The outer lip of young gasteropod shells is usually thin and\r\nfragile; even if slightly thickened, it has an unformed or unfinished\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nShells differ greatly in their /structure/, many species being\r\nporcelanous like china, others glassy, and many more are of a softer\r\nchalky composition. In the latter case the shell is usually covered\r\nwith a thick membranous skin, which, when removed, leaves a dull,\r\nlusterless, white body beneath. Shells of this texture, when cast\r\nupon the beach, soon yield to the weathering action of sun and air.\r\nThe porcelanous shells are composed of successive layers of carbonate\r\nof lime, throughout which is a filmy membranous framework of a\r\nsubstance similar to that of which the covering of the /Crustacea/ is\r\nformed. The mode of deposition of the various layers of crystalline\r\ncalcic carbonate and the peculiar lineation of their outer surfaces\r\ngive rise to the iridescent or nacreous appearance of some shells.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of those species in which the mantle of the\r\nanimal is extended over the edge of the aperture and more or less\r\nenvelops the entire test, there is an outer skin of membranous or\r\norganic matter which overlies the surface of the shell. This skin\r\nis sometimes quite thick, often hairy, and is usually of a dull\r\ngreenish- or brownish-yellow color. In many genera this [pg346]\r\nouter covering of the shell is excessively thin. In old specimens\r\nthe epidermis is usually worn away from the apical whorls. It often\r\nhappens that the shells of the most exquisite colors and markings are\r\nthus rendered somber and unattractive by their tenants during life;\r\nwhen the animal dies, or when such specimens are kept in a cabinet\r\nfor a period of time, the epidermis dries, cracks, and falls off,\r\nrevealing the wealth of color and design beneath.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the gasteropod shell is accomplished by the exudation\r\nfrom the margin of the animal's mantle of a liquid containing the\r\nshelly matter in solution. The mantle-edge is provided with a\r\ncomplicated system of glands and pores, from which is secreted this\r\n\"stony liquor.\" This more or less viscous liquid, containing the\r\ncarbonate of lime and the other inorganic materials of which the\r\nshell is composed, hardens upon exposure, and the shelly matter is\r\nthen deposited in crystalline form around the edges or lip of the\r\nshell aperture. The gasteropod shell therefore grows by the continual\r\nbuilding out of its aperture through successive depositions of shelly\r\nmatter at the extreme edge of the lip. At the extreme edge of the\r\nmantle margin are situated those glands which secrete the materials\r\nfor the epidermis of the shell, and as one would therefore expect,\r\nthis outermost layer of epidermis is first produced in the advancing\r\ngrowth of the shell. There also are situated the pigment-glands,\r\nwhich produce the color-secretions. The various layers of the shelly\r\nsubstance are successively deposited inside the mouth of the shell by\r\nglands situated just back of the extreme edge of the mantle margin.\r\nThus in the growth stage, if one could examine closely the aperture\r\nof a gasteropod shell, one would observe at the extreme tip of the\r\nlip this projecting epidermis, just beneath it and just inside the\r\naperture a thin deposit of shelly matter, just beneath this, and\r\nfarther in, another layer, and still farther in a third layer.\r\n\r\nThe growth of nearly all gasteropod shells is marked by periods of\r\nrest. During the inactive seasons the creature may thicken the edge\r\nof the aperture to a greater or less extent by an extra deposit of\r\nshelly matter, for otherwise the thin lip might soon be [pg347]\r\ninjured or broken. These places where the lip was thickened, as a\r\ntemporary protection until the young animal decided to continue\r\nbuilding, appear on the surface of adult shells, and persist as\r\n/varices/, \"raised lines of growth,\" \"longitudinal ribs,\" etc. Such\r\nforms of sculptural markings generally occur at equidistant points\r\nand preserve a scheme of regularity which would indicate that the\r\nperiods of rest were of seasonal occurrence. All irregularities and\r\nall surface features of the external shell simply reflect certain\r\npeculiarities of the mantle margin of the animal; all spinous\r\nprocesses, for instance, as in the marvelous /Murex tenuispina/,\r\nindicate the existence of finger-like processes extending from the\r\nmantle margin, which once occupied the hollow thorns projecting\r\nfrom the shell. When the outer surface of a shell is devoid of\r\nany sculpturing and is perfectly smooth, one may assume that the\r\nmantle margin of the animal was simple. If the edge of the lip has\r\na crenulated appearance and the surface of the whorls is decorated\r\nwith revolving ribs, the mantle margin was probably folded or wavy.\r\nThere can be no doubt but that the entire mantle surface is provided\r\nto some extent with glands for the secretion of shelly matter, for\r\nif any portion of the shell is accidentally injured the animal soon\r\nrepairs the break with a calcareous deposit. But such repairs are\r\nnever homogeneous in texture with the other parts of the shell of\r\nnormal growth; the patches are never covered externally with an\r\nepidermis, and they are always devoid of color. The function of the\r\nepidermis is to protect the calcareous shell from the corroding\r\nagents contained in sea-water. Hence it is that, when the epidermis\r\nis removed, \"dead shells\" exposed to the influence of the water\r\nor the weather soon lose their brilliancy and luster, and become\r\nundesirable for specimens either for the cabinet or for study. It\r\noften happens that living shells, inhabiting a region where, for one\r\ncause or another, the water is highly charged with impurities of an\r\nacid nature, are discovered to be badly corroded about the apex,\r\nwhere the epidermis is thin and likely to be rubbed off. For this\r\nreason specimens collected in harbors near large cities or near the\r\nmouths of rivers are apt to be poor and defective.\r\n\r\nThe inner surface of all shells, if not actually nacreous, is\r\n[pg348] always perfectly smooth. When foreign substances, such as\r\ngrains of sand, enter the shell and cannot be removed by the animal,\r\nthe irritation caused thereby to the soft, fleshy creature induces\r\ndischarges of a liquid from the glandular surface of the mantle,\r\nwhich hardens about the offending substance and glazes it over with a\r\nsmooth, pearly deposit.\r\n\r\n/Acmæa testudinalis/ (page 343) presents a special type of gasteropod\r\nshell which is found in several families. Here the spire seems to\r\nbe wholly absent, and the entire shell consists of but one large\r\nbody-whorl. There are very many of these patelliform species,\r\ninhabiting many seas and belonging to many different genera, and\r\nin nearly all cases their embryonic shells display a spiral form.\r\nAfter birth the animal does not build his house upon the spiral\r\nplan, but expands the shell into one large shield-like covering.\r\nThe student, however, must not presume that /Acmæa/ is an ancestral\r\ntype just because the simple character of the shell is suggestive\r\nof the model chosen to represent a schematic mollusk; anatomically\r\n/Acmæa/ presents the complications of body-torsion which show a very\r\nconsiderable evolutionary change, and indicate that its simple shell\r\nis probably a degenerate form of a once more highly developed and\r\nconvoluted one.\r\n\r\nThe forms, the architecture, and the painting of gasteropod shells\r\nare so infinite in variety that it would be unwise to attempt a\r\ndescription of their marvels. A close observer of nature's works\r\nsoon becomes prepared for every surprise, but he never ceases to be\r\ncharmed and fascinated by his new discoveries. The careful student\r\nalone can learn really to see and appreciate the wonders of nature,\r\nand this is especially true in the study of the /Mollusca/.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF GASTEROPODS\r\n\r\nThe /Gasteropoda/ far exceed all the other divisions of the\r\n/Mollusca/ in the number of their genera and species. Apparently\r\nthis has not always been the case. There is evidence tending to show\r\nthat in past geological epochs the pelecypods (the bivalve shells)\r\noutnumbered the gasteropods, but that in the course of time the\r\nincrease in the genera of gasteropods has been more [pg349] rapid.\r\nTo judge also from the very large number of extinct families among\r\nthe cephalopods, which once flourished in astonishing abundance, it\r\nwould appear that they are a dying race.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the /Gasteropoda/ is primarily a division into\r\nthree great orders: the /Opisthobranchiata/, the /Prosobranchiata/,\r\nand the /Pulmonata/. The /Pulmonata/, which include the land and\r\nfresh-water gasteropod shells, are characterized by the presence of\r\na breathing-sac, or lung, instead of gills. They are, therefore,\r\nessentially air-breathers, and would perish if kept too long under\r\nwater. The /Opisthobranchiata/ and /Prosobranchiata/ are marine,\r\nand, like all animals which breathe by means of gills, soon die\r\nwhen removed from the water. We have already noted, however, how\r\nsome genera of marine gasteropods that find their station about\r\nhigh-tide mark are able to live for considerable periods out of the\r\nwater, notwithstanding the fact that they are fully equipped with\r\ngills and not possessed of lungs. Indeed, there is one large family\r\nof prosobranchs (the /Cyclostomatidæ/) that has become entirely\r\nterrestrial in habit, its members having lost their gills and\r\nacquired lungs, but their organization otherwise is so essentially\r\nthat of the prosobranchs that they have never been considered as\r\npulmonates.\r\n\r\nThe main difference between these two orders of marine gasteropods\r\nis that in the prosobranchs the breathing-organs (the gills) are\r\nplaced in a position forward of the heart, and the degree of torsion\r\n(page 330) characteristic of this molluscan class has been continued\r\nuntil the auricle of the heart is in front of the ventricle. There\r\nis always a shell, usually spiral, and, with few exceptions, an\r\noperculum. In the opisthobranchs, on the other hand, the relative\r\nposition of the heart and gills is reversed, and they further differ\r\nfrom the prosobranchs in that the sexes are always united in each\r\nindividual. The opisthobranchs are not always provided with a shell.\r\nOne division of the order, known as the \"nudibranchs,\" are entirely\r\nnaked. These are commonly called the \"sea-slugs,\" and are to be\r\nfound crawling about the marine vegetation in shallow water, in\r\ntide-pools, and on the piling of old docks. Curiously enough, the\r\nsea-slugs (see page 354) have no gills at all, but, having lost these\r\napparently essential organs, are [pg350] enabled to \"breathe water\"\r\nthrough their skin. They are wonderfully beautiful creatures, and the\r\ncollector must not fail to secure some specimens, put them into a jar\r\nof sea-water, and watch them expand.\r\n\r\nThere are other more superficial differences between the prosobranchs\r\nand the opisthobranchs, which will enable even a beginner to\r\ndistinguish them at a glance. When the latter are possessed of an\r\nexternal shell, it is bulbous, generally glassy, and with a simple\r\nlip, the aperture extending the entire length of the shell. Again,\r\nthe mantle or the propodium of the foot is greatly extended and\r\nusually covers the shell almost wholly.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the nudibranchs, which are common all along\r\nthe Atlantic shore, especially north of Cape Cod, there are very few\r\nopisthobranchs to be found in American waters. Their shells are not\r\nvery abundantly found anywhere, though in Florida there are two or\r\nthree species which an untrained collector might discover.\r\n\r\nPractically all the gasteropod or univalve shells that will be taken\r\nby the ordinarily expert collector along the shore are prosobranchs.\r\nThis order includes the great majority of marine gasteropods, and\r\nis entitled to the distinction of claiming, in the great number of\r\nits genera and species, the most startling eccentricities of form\r\nand color to be found among the /Mollusca/, if not among all marine\r\ninvertebrates.\r\n\r\nOnly those species which are actually abundant on the Atlantic and\r\nPacific shores of the United States, and which are likely to be found\r\nby the untrained collector, are selected from the long list of forms\r\nwhich belong to the three faunal regions involved.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =OPISTHOBRANCHIATA=\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ~TECTIBRANCHIATA~\r\n\r\nTo avoid confusion, it is well to keep the systematic table in view:\r\n\r\n  Class             Orders                Suborders\r\n\r\n  =GASTEROPODA=    =OPISTHOBRANCHIATA=    =TECTIBRANCHIATA=\r\n                                          =NUDIBRANCHIATA=\r\n                   =PROSOBRANCHIATA=\r\n                   =PULMONATA=\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXV. Bulla occidentalis, enlarged. Bulla\r\nnebulosa. Lottia gigantea, inside view. Fissurella alternata.]\r\n\r\nAs has already been remarked, shell-bearing opisthobranchs are not\r\nabundantly represented in number of species in North American waters.\r\nSouth of Cape Cod, in muddy bays and well-sheltered places, the\r\nlittle shell, /Haminea solitaria/, may, however, often be found in\r\nconsiderable numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Haminea^\r\n\r\n  ^H. solitaria.^ Like all external opisthobranch tests, the shell of\r\n  this species is thin and fragile, and would appear to be of small\r\n  importance to the creature it only partially protects. It is devoid\r\n  of spire, is shining bluish-white, sometimes brownish in color,\r\n  and is marked with revolving grooves, which, being cut across by\r\n  irregular growth-lines, give its surface a faintly decussated\r\n  appearance. The aperture is as long as the shell; the columella is\r\n  incurved. This little species is especially abundant in shallow\r\n  water about Vineyard Sound and in Peconic Bay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Haminea solitaria./]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Bulla^\r\n\r\n  ^B. occidentalis.^ This species, which is found in the waters\r\n  of Florida on all sandy beaches, is a relative of the Northern\r\n  species just described. The shell is larger than that of /Haminea\r\n  solitaria/, and has a color-pattern of mottled or clouded\r\n  reddish-brown on a white foundation. There is no spire; there\r\n  is a pit in place of an apex; and the aperture extends the full\r\n  length of the shell. To the naked eye the surface appears smooth\r\n  and shining. It is an exceedingly variable species, occurring all\r\n  through the West Indies, but not north of Florida. The shores of\r\n  the keys along the west coast of Florida are often strewn with\r\n  these shells after storms. The animal, like all the shell-bearing\r\n  opisthobranchs, is very large as compared with the shell, and the\r\n  large mantle folds recurve upward, almost completely hiding the\r\n  shell from view. (Plate LXV.)\r\n\r\n  ^B. nebulosa.^ This is one of the largest and finest species of\r\n  the family /Bullidæ/. It is found on the coast of California south\r\n  of San Francisco. The shell is much larger than that of either of\r\n  the Atlantic species mentioned above, but very closely resembles\r\n  them in outline, although it is built upon a more generous plan\r\n  and is more richly painted. It is brownish, mottled with white and\r\n  yellow patches, and is very suggestive of certain kinds of birds'\r\n  eggs. The animals have a greatly extended mantle which almost\r\n  completely envelops the shell. The foot is extremely large, with\r\n  great wing-like developments upon each side, called parapodia. Some\r\n  species of /Bulla/ have been seen to swim by means of the lazy\r\n  flapping of the parapodia. (Plate LXV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA-HARES\r\n\r\nClosely allied to these outer-shell-bearing opisthobranchs is a large\r\nand important group of tectibranchs, known as [pg351] \"sea-hares.\"\r\nThey have a mantle so greatly developed that it actually covers the\r\nshell, and its edges unite and fuse over the top. The shell, in\r\nconsequence, having almost ceased to be of use as a protection, has\r\ndegenerated into a mere horny plate, and has lost all resemblance to\r\nthe ordinary gasteropod shell. Having practically lost its protective\r\noffice and become a mere internal plate, it is quite probable that\r\nit will in time wholly disappear. The gills of the sea-hares are\r\nconcealed under a flap of the mantle, their position being posterior\r\nto the heart. The most conspicuous representative of this type of\r\ntectibranchs in the United States is the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Aplysia^\r\n\r\n  ^A. Wilcoxii.^ This species appears at times in vast numbers in\r\n  the waters of Florida, until the sea may truly be said to be\r\n  fairly alive with them. They swim lazily with a waving motion of\r\n  the parapodia. They disappear as mysteriously as they come, and\r\n  for months not a specimen will be seen. There is a variety of this\r\n  Floridian /Aplysia/ which occurs at Cape May, but no sea-hares are\r\n  to be found north of that point. The tropical Pacific furnishes an\r\n  astonishing wealth of these creatures, belonging to many genera\r\n  and species, and among them are some of the most beautiful of the\r\n  invertebrate animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ~NUDIBRANCHIATA~\r\n\r\nThe opisthobranchs are divided into two suborders, the second of\r\nwhich is called /Nudibranchiata/. The name is well chosen and\r\nvery suggestive, for it means \"naked or exposed gills\"; but this\r\nanatomical feature is only one of the peculiarities of this suborder.\r\nThe nudibranchs are commonly known as \"sea-slugs\"; for, like the\r\nland-slugs, which are also true mollusks, they possess no shell at\r\nall. That they at one time carried a shell is evident from the fact\r\nthat they are born with a rudimentary testaceous covering, which soon\r\nafterward disappears.\r\n\r\nA striking peculiarity of the nudibranchs is that the conventional\r\nmolluscan mantle is not usually apparent. Instead of seeing the usual\r\nflaps or folds of the mantle which more or less encircle mollusks,\r\nand which one seems to have a right to expect, [pg352] they are\r\nentirely absent, and the body of the sea-slug assumes in consequence\r\na worm-like appearance. Other notable features of the nudibranchs\r\nare the great number of tentacular processes that usually project\r\nfrom the dorsal region of the animal, and, in many of the genera, an\r\nentire absence of gills. When the gills are present, as is the case\r\nin several of the nudibranch families, they are not placed along the\r\nside of the animal, where one would naturally look for them, but are\r\narranged in the form of a rosette of plume-like processes situated in\r\nthe posterior dorsal region, or, in other words, on the animal's back.\r\n\r\nNudibranchs are commonly to be found all along the Atlantic and\r\nPacific coasts of North America, and more especially in the colder\r\nwaters north of Cape Cod. They are essentially littoral, and live\r\nupon algæ in shallow water, upon eel-grass in sheltered places,\r\nand in tide-pools, where there is more or less vegetation. They\r\ncrawl about the fronds of algæ, or swim, foot upward, with a gentle\r\nand undulating motion, or, when caught between tides, may be seen\r\nclinging to the under surface of rocks. Protective resemblances\r\nhave been so remarkably developed in the nudibranchs that they are\r\nnot always easy to discover; indeed, one may actually be looking at\r\none for some time without suspecting it to be other than some torn\r\nfragment of seaweed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are many species belonging to several genera which frequent\r\nthe Maine and Massachusetts coasts, but those most likely to be\r\nencountered are the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Dendronotus^\r\n\r\n  ^D. arborescens.^ This species is about one inch long and variable\r\n  in color, but is usually reddish-brown or rose. There are no\r\n  tentacles, but in their place are two antler-like appendages\r\n  pointing forward and branched like a tree. All along the back are\r\n  two rows of these curiously branched processes, which give to\r\n  the animal the appearance of a plant. These /cerata/, or dorsal\r\n  papillæ, are delicately transparent, contractile, and richly\r\n  colored. The function of these papillæ is not fully known. As\r\n  the animal has no specialized breathing-organs, it is reasonable\r\n  to suppose that respiration is carried on through the outer skin\r\n  and perhaps all over the surface of these branched papillæ. The\r\n  liver, which [pg354] in most nudibranchs is extremely large and\r\n  completely surrounds the stomach, in /Dendronotus/ also extends\r\n  into these dorsal cerata, so that they may have some sort of\r\n  digestive function.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Dendronotus arborescens./]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Æolis^\r\n\r\n  ^Æ. papillosa.^ This is probably the commonest nudibranch upon\r\n  the North Atlantic coast, and it occurs as frequently in European\r\n  waters. It may readily be found clinging to stones, algæ, the\r\n  piling of wharves, eel-grass, etc., in bays or in rocky tide-pools.\r\n  The color is yellowish-gray to orange, with purplish or olive\r\n  spots. The cerata are very numerous, and cover the dorsal portion\r\n  of the animal save for an open space along the middle of the back.\r\n  There are two sets of tentacles, the two dorsal and the two simple\r\n  labial tentacles. The foot tapers behind to a sharp point, and is\r\n  truncate in front. As in /Dendronotus/, the liver is diffused into\r\n  the cerata, which in /Æolis/ are simple tubular processes without\r\n  the branching character of those of the former. Both species lay\r\n  their eggs in a gelatinous, bobbin-like cord, which is hung in\r\n  festoons over rocks or upon zoöphytes, or at times they wind the\r\n  cord in a coil upon the surfaces of stones. When the young first\r\n  hatch out, they are provided with a glassy nautiloid shell, a fact\r\n  which would indicate that at some remote period they were, like\r\n  most mollusks, provided with a shell. /Æolis/ swims in an inverted\r\n  position, and is at times exceedingly active. It is very variable\r\n  in coloring and in the number of cerata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Æolis papillosa./]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Doris^\r\n\r\n  ^D. bilamellata.^ In /Doris/ we find a quite different type of\r\n  nudibranch from that presented by the two genera /Dendronotus/\r\n  and /Æolis/. In one there were numerous branched cerata or dorsal\r\n  papillæ, in the other many plain cerata, and in neither case were\r\n  there any specialized [pg355] breathing-organs. In /Doris/,\r\n  however, there are no dorsal papillæ at all, the back being covered\r\n  with calcareous spicules, which form a sort of secondary shell.\r\n  There is a circlet, or rosette, of retractile plume-like gills, or\r\n  branchiæ, placed in the middle of the back posteriorly. There are\r\n  various species of /Doris/, and of closely allied genera belonging\r\n  to the family /Dorididæ/, which are to be found along the New\r\n  England coast in tide-pools and among rocks. Those seen by the\r\n  writer never appeared to be other than very sluggish creatures, and\r\n  proved to be rather unsatisfactory tenants of the aquarium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Doris bilamellata./]\r\n\r\nWhen discovered at low tide upon moist seaweed or stones, or when\r\ndisturbed in the water, nudibranchs often appear like small lumps of\r\njelly-like tissue, without a single attractive feature. It is only\r\nwhen they are placed in a jar of sea-water and left unmolested for\r\na few moments that they unfold their beauties to the view. On the\r\nPacific coast there are numerous species of nudibranchs, occupying\r\ncorresponding shore stations and exhibiting the same degree of high\r\ncoloration. There are over a thousand species of sea-slugs scattered\r\nabout the various seas. They find their greatest development in\r\ntropical waters, and for brilliancy of tint and variation in form\r\nare unequaled by any other class of animal life, save perhaps the\r\nbutterflies.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =PROSOBRANCHIATA=\r\n\r\nTo this exceedingly large and comprehensive order of gasteropods\r\nbelong the great majority of univalve mollusks. In point of number of\r\ngenera and species and in abundance of individuals, the prosobranchs\r\nprobably exceed all the other orders of mollusks combined. They may\r\nbe called the typical gasteropods, the shell being univalvular and\r\ngenerally spiral, and the animal exhibiting the singular torsion\r\nof the visceral mass which has placed the breathing-organs forward\r\nof the heart. They are provided with an operculum (placed upon the\r\nposterior dorsal portion of the foot), which is used to close the\r\naperture of the shell against [pg356] enemies when the animal\r\nretires within its fortress. They are all marine except a very\r\nfew families, which, supposedly of marine derivation, have become\r\nterrestrial in habit.\r\n\r\nThe prosobranchs are further subdivided into suborders according to\r\ncertain peculiarities of the heart and breathing-organs. There is\r\na group of these prosobranchs which gives evidence of an inferior\r\ndegree of that visceral torsion which is always found in the\r\ngasteropods. In this group, or suborder, the heart has two auricles,\r\nand there is a pair of gills instead of only a single one. Other\r\ninternal organs are paired just as they were represented to be in\r\nthe schematic mollusk. This group also seems to show its primitive\r\ncharacter in the want of a proboscis and a siphon, or, in some\r\nfamilies, by having the ventricle of the heart traversed by the\r\nintestinal canal, just as in the lower class of mollusks, which\r\nincludes the clams and oysters. For the most part the shells of this\r\ngroup are not typically spiral, but are patelliform, shield-like\r\ncoverings, with only a suggestion of a spiral form at the very tip\r\nof the apex. This group of primitive prosobranchs is included in the\r\nfollowing suborder:\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ~DIATOCARDIA~\r\n\r\nThis suborder is named from the presence of two auricles in the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~ACMÆIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThe first family to be noted is the /Acmæidæ/. Its principal genus,\r\n/Acmæa/, is well represented on both the east and the west coast of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Acmæa^\r\n\r\n  ^A. testudinalis.^ This species is found in vast numbers all along\r\n  the New England shore, clinging to the rocks between tides. They\r\n  are usually called limpets. The shell is solid, conical, with an\r\n  oval outline, and with no trace of a spiral form in the adult. When\r\n  the shell is thoroughly cleaned, it generally presents a mottled\r\n  coloration of pale green, brown, and white. Inside it is white\r\n  and nacreous, with a large brown [pg357] area under the apex.\r\n  The animal has a powerful foot, by means of which it is enabled\r\n  to cling to a rock with great strength. In order to dislodge it,\r\n  it is necessary to approach carefully, and, taking the creature\r\n  unawares, quickly slip a broad knife-blade under the foot,\r\n  otherwise it is quite impossible to tear it from its resting-place.\r\n  /A. testudinalis/ lives entirely between tides, and ranges from the\r\n  northernmost waters to New York. It feeds upon algæ and is a very\r\n  sluggish animal. It has been said to leave its resting-place and\r\n  wander about in search of food, returning to its original and usual\r\n  spot when the tide begins to ebb. (Page 343.)\r\n\r\n  ^A. testudinalis,^ variety ^alveus.^ This variety is smaller, more\r\n  fragile, and oblong. It lives upon eel-grass, its oblong shell\r\n  being adapted to the narrow leaves of the grass. The coloration is\r\n  brighter--reddish-brown spots on a white surface. It is exceedingly\r\n  common on the New England coast.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Acmæa testudinalis/, var. /alveus./]\r\n\r\n  ^A. mitra.^ On the Pacific coast there are a number of acmæas. /A.\r\n  mitra/ is often found dead upon the beaches. It is conical in form\r\n  and pure creamy-white in color. It looks very much like a clown's\r\n  pointed cap.\r\n\r\n  ^A. patina.^ This is also very abundant in California. Outside it\r\n  is dark in color and is often incrusted with mineral deposits.\r\n  Within there is a dark ring around the edge, then a zone of\r\n  bluish-white, and a patch of brown just beneath the apex.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Lottia^\r\n\r\n  ^L. gigantea.^ This is the largest of the California limpets.\r\n  Specimens three inches long have been found. The outer surface\r\n  of the shell is rough and brownish in color. The apex is near\r\n  one end. Within it is almost black, shining, lustrous, with a\r\n  horseshoe-shaped muscle-scar under the apex. The color is bluish\r\n  and brown. (Plate LXV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~FISSURELLIDÆ~\r\n\r\n  This is an extensive family, including several genera and a number\r\n  of species, commonly known as keyhole-limpets. In the general form\r\n  of the shell they closely resemble the true limpets, the /Acmæidæ/,\r\n  except that they have a hole, or rather a slit, in the shell just\r\n  back of the apex. Often this slit is so long that it has entirely\r\n  removed the apex of the conical shell.\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Fissurella^\r\n\r\n  ^F. alternata^, ^F. barbadensis^. These species occur upon the\r\n  southern shores of the United States, the latter, however, being\r\n  confined to [pg358] extreme southern Florida. /F. barbadensis/\r\n  has heavy longitudinal ribs and is light green within, with a rosy\r\n  circle about the apical perforation. (Plate LXV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Glyphis^\r\n\r\n  ^G. aspersa.^ One of the numerous species belonging to this family\r\n  which are found on the west coast of the United States. It is about\r\n  one and a half inches long, grayish-white, with sharply raised\r\n  longitudinal ridges, slightly rayed, crossed by revolving ribs,\r\n  which give to the outer surface a decussated appearance. The apex\r\n  is forward of the center, and is entirely replaced by a round\r\n  perforation. The edge is wrinkled, and within smooth and white.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Lucapina^\r\n\r\n  ^L. crenulata.^ The largest of the keyhole-limpets; the shell\r\n  is often four inches in length, while the animal, with its huge\r\n  yellowish foot and dark-colored mantle, which is thrown back,\r\n  almost concealing the shell upon its back, is much larger. The\r\n  apical perforation is very large. Shell flattened, with radiating,\r\n  rounded, crowded ribs; brownish-white in color; edge crenulated;\r\n  within pure white. It is found at Monterey, but live specimens are\r\n  not very frequently seen near the beach. (Plate LXVI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~HALIOTIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Haliotis^\r\n\r\nThis family is closely allied to the /Fissurellidæ/. The species are\r\nknown on the Pacific coast by the name of abalone shells, and in\r\nEngland and the Channel Islands as ormers or sea-ears. There are no\r\nspecies of /Haliotis/ on the east coast of the United States, but\r\none has recently been dredged at a considerable depth in West Indian\r\nwaters. This family, with the last, possesses the striking anatomical\r\nfeature of having the heart traversed by the digestive tract. It\r\nalso has two gills, the degree of torsion in the visceral mass not\r\nbeing sufficient to have crowded out and destroyed the original\r\nright gill. The shell is spiral, but is so greatly flattened, and\r\nthe body-whorl is so greatly extended, that the shell quite loses\r\nthe spiral appearance. Along the dorsal side of the shell is a row\r\nof holes, through which project numerous tentacular processes from\r\nthe mantle. The outer surface of the shell, before it is polished,\r\nis usually rough and unattractive, but within, when the [pg359]\r\nanimal is removed, it displays a most beautiful and highly colored\r\nnacreous surface. The spot near the center of the inner shell\r\nsurface where the muscles of the foot were attached is usually\r\nmost brilliantly colored. The shell of the abalone is susceptible\r\nof taking a very high degree of polish, and is extensively used in\r\ncommerce for colored mother-of-pearl and for inlaid work. /Haliotis/\r\nis a vegetable-feeding genus. They cling with great tenacity to rocks\r\nabout low tide, and it requires skill to remove them without breaking\r\nthe shell. There are several species in California. The Chinese use\r\nthe abalone for food, and have waged a persistent war upon the family\r\nalong the Pacific coast until the specimens are not nearly as common\r\nas formerly. They are also eaten in France and in Japan.\r\n\r\n  ^H. splendens.^ The largest and perhaps the most attractive in\r\n  appearance of the Californian species. Speaking of this beautiful\r\n  shell, Professor Keep says: \"Within, a whole rainbow is condensed\r\n  in one of the magnificent shells, though the shades of green are\r\n  most conspicuous. The coloring in the center is particularly fine,\r\n  resembling a peacock's tail. There are about six open holes near\r\n  one side of the shell, and its length is about the same number of\r\n  inches.\" (Plate LXVI.)\r\n\r\n  ^H. rufescens.^ A large abalone, which sometimes attains a length\r\n  of eight or nine inches. It is red in color, with three open holes\r\n  in the body-whorl. The outer portion of the shell is usually\r\n  incrusted with mineral deposit and overgrown with vegetation.\r\n\r\n  ^H. cracherodii.^ Very dark green without, with five to nine holes;\r\n  length from one to six inches; spire exceedingly short. Common on\r\n  the Californian coast in crevices of rocks at low tide.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~TROCHIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThis is one of the largest and most interesting families of the\r\n/Mollusca/. It contains many apparently widely separated genera\r\nand a host of species, which for the most part are littoral, the\r\nmajority actually living between tide-marks. The typical trochid\r\nshell is top-shaped or pyramidal, having a broad base and many\r\nclosely wound flat whorls terminating in a sharp apex. All the\r\ntrochids are nacreous within the aperture--a character which is\r\nconstant throughout the family. The animal has but one gill (the\r\nleft), a short snout, and often frontal lobes on the head. The\r\nedge of the mantle or the epipodial line of the foot is usually\r\nornamented with from three to five cirri. The tentacles are [pg360]\r\nlong and slender, with short peduncles for the eyes; the operculum\r\nis corneous, with a central nucleus. The animals are herbivorous,\r\nfeeding upon algæ. The trochids are essentially tropical shells, and\r\nthe most of the genera which are comprised in the family are only to\r\nbe encountered in the warm waters of the Pacific and Indian oceans.\r\nSome forms are very beautiful, and frequently are used as mantel\r\nornaments, and the shells of one little species, which is opalescent\r\nin its coloring, are still extensively gathered in the East Indies,\r\nto be polished and strung like pearls in necklaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Margarita^\r\n\r\nOn the Atlantic coast north of Cape Cod the trochids are represented\r\nby the genus /Margarita/, with five or six species. The shells are\r\nsmall, thin, and globosely depressed, with smooth or transversely\r\nstriated whorls. The aperture is nearly circular, with a simple lip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Margarita cinerea./]\r\n\r\n  ^M. cinerea.^ This species has several prominent revolving ridges\r\n  upon the upper side of the whorls, with finer ones on the base.\r\n  Very fine growth-lines cover the entire shell. It ranges all along\r\n  the coast north of Cape Cod, but is not usually found between\r\n  tides. The writer has dredged many specimens in shallow water at\r\n  Eastport and Bar Harbor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Margarita helicina./]\r\n\r\n  ^M. helicina.^ A thinner and more globose species than the last,\r\n  with a translucent, shining, smooth surface of a yellowish or olive\r\n  color. /M. helicina/ is very fond of the leaves of /Laminaria/, and\r\n  is often found clinging to them when storms have torn these great\r\n  algæ from the bottom and cast them upon the shore. At Bar Harbor\r\n  they are common upon the eel-grass in Rodicks Weir. This species\r\n  can generally be distinguished by its iridescent, metallic luster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Margarita undulata./]\r\n\r\n  ^M. undulata.^ A commoner species, perhaps, than either of the\r\n  preceding, sometimes found on the rocks of sheltered coves at\r\n  exceptionally low tides. Judging from the number often to be found\r\n  in the stomachs of fishes, they must be considered excellent food\r\n  by the cod and its allied species which thrive along the Maine\r\n  coast. No doubt millions of /M. undulata/ are yearly destroyed\r\n  in this way. The shell is depressed, with four rounded whorls, a\r\n  flattish base, and a large umbilical opening. In color it varies\r\n  from rose-red to brown. The surface is decorated with numerous\r\n  revolving raised lines placed at uniform distances. Just below\r\n  the suture the body-whorl is somewhat undulated with short folds.\r\n  Height three tenths of an inch, base four tenths of an inch.\r\n  [pg361]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Calliostoma^\r\n\r\nThis genus is better represented on the Pacific coast of the United\r\nStates than upon the Atlantic. It comprises a series of marvelously\r\nbeautiful shells, often exquisitely colored. They are regularly\r\nconical or pyramidal in shape, with flattened bases. One never tires\r\nin the search for calliostomas. They are not common enough to cause\r\none to lose interest, and whenever a good specimen is captured it\r\nseems as though one had found some gem cut and polished by nature's\r\nskilful hand and prepared for a place of honor in the cabinet.\r\n\r\n  ^C. occidentale.^ The only species of this genus found on the\r\n  northeast coast. It is larger than /Margarita cinerea/, but\r\n  somewhat resembles it. It is shining nacreous within and without,\r\n  and has strong revolving ribs, the upper one on each whorl often\r\n  being broken into a circular row of white dots. The lip is\r\n  crenulated. This very pretty species is not likely to be met with\r\n  upon the shore, but may be dredged in shallow water on gravelly\r\n  bottoms along the Maine coast. Height about one half of an inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Calliostoma occidentale./]\r\n\r\n  ^C. jujubinum.^ A species which occurs in the waters of Florida.\r\n  Its form is almost that of a true pyramid. The sutures can scarcely\r\n  be distinguished. The shell is marked by brown and purplish-red\r\n  spots on a white background, and has numerous revolving ribs broken\r\n  into rows of white dots like little glazed beads. The umbilicus\r\n  is funnel-shaped and wide. In Tampa Bay this shell is frequently\r\n  found on sponges, and may sometimes be gathered on the beach after\r\n  storms, even as far north as Hatteras. There are as many as twenty\r\n  species of this genus in American Atlantic waters, but they are\r\n  either rare or have deep-water stations.\r\n\r\n  ^C. annulatum.^ A remarkable species of /Calliostoma/, found in\r\n  California. The whorls are adorned with revolving rows of raised\r\n  dots, and the sutures are frescoed in exquisite purple. This\r\n  beautiful species lives upon seaweed, and on pleasant days comes\r\n  to the surface of the water. It can then be collected from a boat\r\n  by drawing in quantities of seaweed. It is very unlikely that the\r\n  collector will ever find a specimen upon the beach, for the shell\r\n  is too fragile to withstand the rough handling of the waves. Length\r\n  one inch.\r\n\r\n  ^C. canaliculatum.^ The largest member of this genus to be found\r\n  in American waters. It resembles the last species in form, but\r\n  lacks the purple sutures. The revolving ribs are very numerous and\r\n  prominent. There is no umbilicus. Length one to one and a half\r\n  inches. Found on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\n  ^C. costatum.^ A heavier shell than the preceding, with somewhat\r\n  more rounded whorls. Reddish-brown in color; numerous revolving\r\n  ridges; no umbilicus; about three quarters of an inch in length. It\r\n  is found in rocky places, and sometimes in considerable numbers,\r\n  just at low-tide mark. Found in California. [pg362]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Chlorostoma^\r\n\r\nThis genus is represented in California by several species, the\r\ncommonest of which is probably /C. funebrale/--a doleful name, no\r\ndoubt given on account of the jet-black color.\r\n\r\n  ^C. funebrale.^ The shell is thick and strong, like most\r\n  between-tide species, which are constantly exposed to the buffeting\r\n  of the waves. It is to be found in countless thousands upon rocks\r\n  exposed at low tide, and may be gathered at any time except full\r\n  flood-tide, like the littorinas and purpuras of the east coast.\r\n  Within the aperture the surface is nacreous and greenish in tint;\r\n  the last whorl is drawn in, like gathers, at the suture. The\r\n  umbilicus is closed. There is a white nodule at the base of the lip\r\n  of the columella. Length one half of an inch to one inch. (Plate\r\n  LXVII.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. brunneum.^ This species is brown, as its name would indicate,\r\n  and there is greenish nacre within the aperture. It lives upon\r\n  kelp, or upon rocks at very low tide. Length about an inch. (Plate\r\n  LXVI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Trochiscus^\r\n\r\n  ^T. norrisi.^ A flattened shell with rounded, dome-like spire and\r\n  obtuse apex; a fairly common species. It has a wide, deep umbilicus\r\n  and a sharp lip. It is of a rich brown color, with dark chestnut\r\n  about the umbilical region and greenish-white within the umbilicus;\r\n  there is a band of dark olive-green about the inner margin of the\r\n  lip. The shell is about two inches in diameter and of a somewhat\r\n  greater height. The operculum is multispiral, with a central\r\n  nucleus, and is shaggy and rough. Like all other trochids, it feeds\r\n  upon algæ. It is often found upon the beach after violent storms.\r\n  Found in California, south of San Francisco. (Plate LXVI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Livona^\r\n\r\n  ^L. pica.^ This large and interesting trochid is a West Indian\r\n  species which sometimes occurs in Florida. It lives about coral\r\n  reefs and rocky shores, attaching itself in vast numbers to the\r\n  rocks. This shell is a favorite refuge for large hermit-crabs. It\r\n  is a curious sight in certain of the West India islands to see a\r\n  /Livona pica/ shell scrambling up a tree, looking very much out of\r\n  place upon the back of some terrestrially inclined crustacean. When\r\n  well cleaned it is a beautiful shell, with black wavy lines over a\r\n  greenish-white nacreous foundation. The animal has a row of waving\r\n  cirri upon each side of the mantle, and long, slender tentacles.\r\n  It is largely used as an article of diet in the West Indies and\r\n  Central America. (Plate LXVII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~TURBINIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThis family is very closely allied to the trochids, the most striking\r\ndifference being in the operculum, which in the /Turbinidæ/ is\r\ncalcareous and usually smooth and very convex on the outside.\r\n[pg363] The shells are nacreous within, and the animal, with its rows\r\nof waving cirri upon each side, is very suggestive of /Trochus/. They\r\nare, for the most part, shallow-water or littoral forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXVI. 1, Lucapina crenulata. 3, Chlorostoma\r\nbrunneum. 2, Haliotis splendens. 4, Neritina reclivata, enlarged. 5,\r\nTrochiscus norrisi.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXVII.

Nerita tessellata.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Turbo^\r\n\r\n  ^T. castaneus.^ This species has a range as far north as Cape\r\n  Hatteras, and is especially abundant at Tampa, on the west coast of\r\n  Florida. The peculiar operculum is sufficient to identify the genus\r\n  at once. One variety of this species has a crenulated shoulder upon\r\n  the body-whorl and is referred to as ^Turbo crenulatus^, A series\r\n  of intermediate forms establishes the specific identity of the two\r\n  varieties. (Plate LXVII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~NERITIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThe /Neritidæ/ are strictly littoral forms, almost entirely confined\r\nto the warmer waters of tropical seas. The animal preserves the usual\r\ndiatocardian features--has a short snout and long tentacles. Unlike\r\nthe trochids and /Turbo/, it has no cirri along the epipodial margin.\r\nThe shells are peculiarly shaped, the spire being greatly flattened\r\nand scarcely noticeable on account of the unduly large development\r\nof the body-whorl; thus the shell takes on a decidedly patelliform\r\nappearance. It is without an umbilicus. In the principal genus\r\n/Nerita/ the outer lip is sharp on the edge, but greatly thickened\r\njust within.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Nerita^\r\n\r\n  ^N. peleronta.^ This shell has two teeth on the wide, flat\r\n  columellar lip, and about them is a blotch of red, suggesting\r\n  blood. The common name of this shell, \"bleeding-tooth,\" is very\r\n  appropriate. Found in southern Florida. (Plate LXVII.)\r\n\r\n  ^N. tessellata^ is a smaller species, with heavy revolving ribs,\r\n  and is further decorated with transverse oblique black lines. The\r\n  operculum is calcareous. Both of these species have the habit of\r\n  absorbing the entire inner portion of their shells. They belong\r\n  to the West Indian fauna, and occur in great numbers on rocky or\r\n  coral shore stations. They also may be found on the east Florida\r\n  coast, well to the south. A third species, ^N. versicolor^, often\r\n  occurs, associated with the other two. It is somewhat smaller than\r\n  the others and can easily be distinguished by the four teeth on\r\n  the columellar lip, the edge of the columella being convex. (Plate\r\n  LXVII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Neritina^\r\n\r\nThe genus /Neritina/ is very closely allied to the last, having quite\r\nthe same form of shell; but it is usually more globular and [pg364]\r\nvariously ornamented by bright spots or zigzag lines of coloration.\r\nThe neritinas have acquired the habit of ascending rivers, until\r\nthey have become almost wholly a brackish- or fresh-water genus.\r\nThe metropolis of this genus is in the South Sea Islands, where it\r\nattains a wonderful development in the clear running streams of the\r\nvolcanic islands.\r\n\r\n  ^N. reclivata.^ A very pretty olive-green species, with very\r\n  fine, wavy, longitudinal lines of coloration, found in almost\r\n  all Floridian streams above the action of the tide. The nacre of\r\n  the columella and within the aperture is bluish-green, and the\r\n  operculum is rich olive. (Plate LXVI.)\r\n\r\n  ^N. viridis.^ A small, intensely green species, which, unlike most\r\n  neritinas, is strictly marine. It belongs to the great West Indian\r\n  faunal province, but is occasionally found upon the shores of\r\n  Florida and of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe prosobranch gasteropods thus far considered (belonging to the\r\nsuborder /Diatocardia/) all show by their anatomical structure that\r\nthe process of visceral torsion, though carried very far within them,\r\nhas not been complete enough to crowd out and finally destroy one\r\nof each of the paired organs. Both auricles of the heart (with some\r\nexceptions) were left intact.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBORDER ~MONOTOCARDIA~\r\n\r\nIn this the second suborder of the prosobranch gasteropods, the\r\ntwisting visceral process has been carried to the extreme. The\r\nheart has but one auricle. There is but one gill (on the left\r\nside), and this is attached to the inner side of the mantle flap.\r\nIn other respects the presence of certain specialized organs would\r\nprobably indicate that gasteropods belonging to this suborder are\r\na step higher in the scale of life than those which belong to the\r\n/Diatocardia/.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~JANTHINIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Janthina^\r\n\r\nThe genus /Janthina/ has an exceedingly thin and semi-transparent\r\nshell, deep violet in color on the base and lighter blue on the\r\nspire. An interesting feature of this genus is the mode of depositing\r\nthe ova. The female exudes from a gland in the foot a [pg365]\r\nglutinous secretion which hardens in water, and, being filled with\r\nair-bubbles, constitutes a float. On the under side of this are\r\ndeposited the eggs in rows of little capsules. While attached to this\r\nfloat it is impossible for a /Janthina/ to sink, and hence it is that\r\nso many of these creatures are sacrificed in onshore gales of wind.\r\n\r\n  ^J. fragilis.^ The shell of this species is so brittle and fragile\r\n  that it is very clearly not adapted to a life near shore. It is in\r\n  reality a pelagic species which is occasionally blown ashore during\r\n  easterly gales along the Atlantic coast of the United States. Vast\r\n  numbers of these pretty creatures are sometimes encountered far out\r\n  at sea, floating quietly on the surface. When storms drive them\r\n  upon the beach, they become utterly helpless; since their foot\r\n  is not adapted for crawling upon the sand, they soon perish, and\r\n  their brittle shells are demolished by the surf. In Florida the\r\n  beaches are sometimes fairly lined with /Janthina/ shells, which\r\n  make a band of purple along the high-tide mark as far as the eye\r\n  can reach; then it may be years before they again appear. (Plate\r\n  LXVIII.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Janthina fragilis/: /FL/, float; /O/, ova; /Pr/,\r\nproboscis; /Br/, branchiæ; /F/, foot.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~SCALIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Scala^\r\n\r\nThe shells of /Scala/ have such a peculiar scheme of decoration\r\nthat once seen they can never be mistaken. They are generally\r\npure white, with well-rounded whorls, all of which are crossed\r\nat even distances by greatly elevated and smooth ribs. Each rib\r\nrepresents a rest-period, when the creature thickened the rim\r\nof the shell-aperture. The aperture is generally round, with a\r\ncontinuous lip. The animal has a retractile proboscis and long,\r\nslender tentacles with eyes at the outer bases, and is a predaceous,\r\n [pg366] carnivorous creature. Some Asiatic species of this genus,\r\nremarkable for their beauty and rarity, have been greatly prized by\r\ncollectors. A single specimen of the now well-known ^S. pretiosa^ of\r\nChina has been sold for two hundred dollars--a fancy price, indeed,\r\nfor a shell which can now be bought for a dollar! There are over\r\nfifty species of /Scala/ on the Atlantic coast, but most of them are\r\neither rare or belong to a zone of deeper water; there are, however,\r\nfour or five species which are exceedingly common.\r\n\r\n  ^S. lineata.^ A species which ranges from Hatteras to New England.\r\n  It has about eight whorls, and is slightly brownish in color. The\r\n  ribs are robust and not greatly elevated; there are from seventeen\r\n  to nineteen on the body-whorl. The shell is sometimes painted with\r\n  a few revolving brownish lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Scala lineata./]\r\n\r\n  ^S. multistriata.^ The transverse ribs are much smaller but very\r\n  numerous; the small spaces between them are marked with many fine\r\n  revolving lines. Found from Cape Cod southward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Scala multistriata./]\r\n\r\n  ^S. groenlandica.^ Essentially an arctic species, which has found\r\n  its way down to the New England coast. It is readily distinguished\r\n  by the flattened, coarsely rounded, revolving ribs, which follow\r\n  the volutions of the spire. Over them are the usual transverse\r\n  heavy ribs peculiar to this genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Scala groenlandica./]\r\n\r\n  ^S. angulata.^ The whorls touch one another only by the ribs,\r\n  of which there are nine to each volution. This species has a\r\n  remarkably wide range, occurring from Cape Cod to southern Florida.\r\n  (Plate LXVIII.)\r\n\r\n  These four species vary from one half of an inch to one inch in\r\n  length. All of them are found on the beach after storms or may be\r\n  dredged in shallow water near the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~NATICIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThis large and interesting family is well represented in the Atlantic\r\nwaters of the United States, but its more beautiful members live\r\nin the tropics. The New England and New Jersey species are dull in\r\ncolor, but offer much of interest to the collector and student. The\r\nfoot is enormously large, and carries in front a great shield-like\r\nfleshy process, which curves back over the head of the animal and\r\nserves as a plow in pushing its way through the heavy wet sand of\r\nthe beach. When the creature is thus seen extended in the act of\r\ncrawling, one wonders how it is possible for it to withdraw so great\r\nan amount of body into its shell; but if it is suddenly seized or\r\nirritated, it will quickly [pg367] demonstrate its ability\r\nto hide itself completely within its house and to close the door\r\nvery effectively by means of its operculum. The eyes seem to be\r\nwanting, or they are concealed under the skin of the head. The shell\r\nis usually quite large, with a depressed spire and well-rounded\r\nwhorls--especially the body-whorl, which appears to be greatly\r\nswollen. The umbilicus is usually open and moderately large, the lip\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXVIII. Janthina fragilis. Sigaretus\r\nperspectivus, upper side. Scala angulata, enlarged. Sigaretus\r\nperspectivus, under side. Natica canrena. Crepidula aculeata.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Polynices^ (^Lunatia^, ^Natica^).\r\n\r\n  ^P. heros^ (generally referred to as ^Lunatia^ or ^Natica\r\n  heros^). One of the commonest large shells and one of the most\r\n  characteristic species of the New England and New Jersey littoral\r\n  fauna. It is exceedingly common along the Long Island shore, where\r\n  it may be found on the open beach, in pools with a sandy bottom\r\n  left by the receding tide. It is usually partially and frequently\r\n  wholly buried in the sand. The umbilicus is open and large, the\r\n  operculum corneous, and the shell heavy and ashy-white to brownish,\r\n  with (when young) a yellowish epidermis. Its length is from two to\r\n  four inches. It has no ornamentation whatever. /P. heros/ is a most\r\n  voracious creature and spends its time in hunting for flesh--either\r\n  alive or dead--to devour. It feeds upon dead fish, or upon other\r\n  mollusks whose shell it is able to pierce by means of its radula,\r\n  making a little round hole through which it sucks out the flesh\r\n  from within. The curious egg-cases of this species have already\r\n  been referred to. (See Plate I.) It glues together particles of\r\n  sand into the form of a basin with the bottom knocked out and\r\n  broken on one side. In the gelatinous substance of this basin it\r\n  deposits its eggs in a regular order. These hatch out in midsummer.\r\n  Egg-cases of this kind can always be found wherever /Polynices/\r\n  lives. For a long time naturalists were greatly puzzled by these\r\n  curious things, and their blunders are recorded in earlier works,\r\n  where these egg-cases have been elaborately described as living\r\n  animals belonging to various invertebrate orders. The largest and\r\n  best specimens of /P. heros/ are to be found south of Cape Cod.\r\n  (Page 343.)\r\n\r\n  ^P. triseriata.^ A small shell of exactly the same shape as /P.\r\n  heros/, but decorated with three revolving series of bluish or\r\n  chestnut spots. It is pretty well determined that this so-called\r\n  species is only the young of /P. heros/. It is very abundant all\r\n  along the coast.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Polynices triseriata/, young; /Polynices\r\n  triseriata/, older specimen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  ^P. duplicata.^ This is even more abundant than /P. heros/. It\r\n  has a flatter shell, with an obtuse apex and dome-like spire.\r\n  The umbilicus is partly or wholly closed by a thick, callous,\r\n  shelly process thrown off from the columellar lip, and is chestnut\r\n  in color. The surface of the shell is smooth, often polished,\r\n  ashy-white below and light chestnut above. The operculum is\r\n  corneous. The length of the shell varies in different localities\r\n  from one half of an inch to about two [pg368] inches; the breadth\r\n  slightly exceeds the length. /P. duplicata/ has a very extensive\r\n  range, from the Gulf of Mexico to Newfoundland. The largest and\r\n  finest specimens are found in the vicinity of New York and at\r\n  Hatteras. In Florida they are usually smaller. This species cannot\r\n  be confounded with any other upon our coast on account of the heavy\r\n  callous deposit over the umbilicus. Its habits are similar to those\r\n  of /P. heros/.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Polynices duplicata./]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Natica clausa./]\r\n\r\n  ^Natica clausa.^ A Northern species which is fairly abundant on the\r\n  Maine coast. It has a shelly operculum, and the umbilicus is neatly\r\n  closed by a pure white, shining callosity. Its length is about one\r\n  half an inch, its color livid white to light brown, white within.\r\n  The calcareous operculum at once determines this shell. This\r\n  species (as well as the following one) has retained the generic\r\n  name of /Natica/ because of the shelly operculum, as explained\r\n  below.\r\n\r\n  ^N. canrena.^ One of the handsomer species of /Natica/, which\r\n  occurs in Florida. Sometimes it is seen as far north as Hatteras.\r\n  The shell is white, with bars of light chestnut circling the\r\n  whorls, and with zigzag lines of darker purplish hue crossing them.\r\n  The base of the shell is white. The aperture is large and flaring,\r\n  and is purplish within. The umbilicus is partially closed by an\r\n  entering callous plug. The operculum is calcareous, with eccentric,\r\n  deeply cut grooves. Found in sandy stations just about low-water\r\n  mark. (Plate LXVIII.)\r\n\r\n  ^P. lewisii.^ A species which occurs on the west coast of the\r\n  United States. It resembles its New England relative /P. heros/\r\n  very closely. /P. lewisii/ is a Northern species, and does not\r\n  range south of Oregon. Professor Keep mentions one specimen of the\r\n  size of a six-inch globe, but such dimensions are very unusual. A\r\n  good-sized specimen need not exceed four inches in height.\r\n\r\n  ^P. recluziana.^ A species well known on the southern coast of\r\n  California. The umbilicus is closed by a thick, highly polished\r\n  white callosity, and the general shape of the shell is strongly\r\n  suggestive of the common east-coast species /P. duplicata/. A large\r\n  specimen is about two inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n  [There has been much confusion in the generic nomenclature of\r\n  this family. The old name /Natica/ once did service for all the\r\n  species; then the names /Lunatia/, /Neverita/, and /Polynices/ were\r\n  applied to certain special forms; but it has been wisely proposed\r\n  by conchologists to use the name /Natica/ for those forms having\r\n  a shelly operculum, and to adopt the name /Polynices/ for those\r\n  having a corneous operculum. /Lunatia/ and /Neverita/ have become\r\n  subgenera of /Polynices/.] [pg369]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Sigaretus^\r\n\r\nA very interesting species of this genus occurs on the east coast,\r\nsparingly in New Jersey, but very abundantly south of Hatteras.\r\n/Sigaretus/ is a modified /Natica/. The spire is flattened and\r\nminute. The body-whorl, being greatly expanded, gives a wide,\r\nflaring, oblique aperture. The shell is ear-shaped and white, with\r\nfine revolving lines. There is no umbilicus. The operculum is small\r\nand rudimentary. The animal is large, with an enormous foot and\r\ngreatly developed propodium, and is a sand-dweller. The common\r\neast-coast form is ^S. perspectivus^. (Plate LXVIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CAPULIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Crepidula^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Crepidula fornicata./]\r\n\r\n  ^C. fornicata.^ All collectors of mollusks on the Atlantic coast\r\n  sooner or later encounter this exceedingly common species adhering\r\n  to oyster-shells or scallops, and often to other large live shells.\r\n  It is cast upon the beach along the entire length of the Atlantic\r\n  coast. The shell is obliquely oval, dull whitish in color, and\r\n  either smooth or rough or even ribbed, according to the nature\r\n  of the surface to which it clings. The spire is almost entirely\r\n  suppressed, the little inconspicuous apex being turned to one\r\n  side and closely pressed down against the body of the shell. When\r\n  looking into the interior of the shell one is reminded of a boat,\r\n  for the upper portion of the aperture is covered by a horizontal\r\n  shelly partition, called the diaphragm, a space being left below\r\n  which would correspond to the forecastle of a ship. The \"stern\" is\r\n  round, and the \"bow\" is suggestively pointed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Crepidula plana./]\r\n\r\n  ^C. plana.^ In this species the shell is white and flat, or\r\n  slightly concave. Although it is pointed at the \"bow\" end and\r\n  square at the \"stern,\" the nautical resemblance stops there,\r\n  because, being flat, there are no swelling sides and bow. The\r\n  diaphragm is about one half the length of the shell, convex,\r\n  shining, white, and translucent. /C. plana/ lives generally within\r\n  the aperture of large dead shells. It has a wide range, from Maine\r\n  to Florida.\r\n\r\n  ^C. aculeata.^ A common Floridian species which has a remarkable\r\n  range, being found in nearly all the tropical and semi-tropical\r\n  waters of the world. It is smaller than /C. fornicata/, is\r\n  reddish-brown with a white diaphragm, and has several radiating\r\n  ribs on the back, which are inclined to be nodulous. (Plate\r\n  LXVIII.) [pg370]\r\n\r\n  On the Pacific coast the following species are found: ^C. adunca^,\r\n  with a strongly recurved apex, and less than one inch long; ^C.\r\n  rugosa^, rough, brown, with the apex lying on the edge of the\r\n  shell, and one inch in length; ^C. navicelloides^, almost identical\r\n  with the east-coast /C. plana/. /C. aculeata/ also appears.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Crucibulum^\r\n\r\n/Crucibulum/ has a peculiar rounded shield-like form, with a very\r\nsmall apex on one side. Within there is a cup-shaped appendage\r\nattached by one side to the inner margin of the shell. This latter\r\nfeature at once determines the genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Crucibulum striatum/, from above.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Crucibulum striatum/, from below.]\r\n\r\n  ^C. striatum.^ This species has radiating riblets, cut by circular\r\n  lines of growth. No dimension would quite reach an inch. It is a\r\n  common shell on the Atlantic coast, and will be found adhering\r\n  to stones and other shells, but it is not, strictly speaking, a\r\n  littoral species.\r\n\r\n  ^C. spinosum.^ The shell exhibits a strong tendency to spinous\r\n  processes on its back. Found along the southern part of the\r\n  California shore.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~LITTORINIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Littorina^\r\n\r\n/Littorina/ is probably the most characteristic genus of Northern\r\nlittoral regions. Together with some of its allied genera it is also,\r\nprobably, equally characteristic of various tropical littoral faunas\r\nall over the world. The family comprises strictly between-the-tides\r\ngenera and species. Indeed, it is suspected that some species of\r\n/Littorina/ are making very fair progress toward a terrestrial\r\ncondition, for they actually live above high-tide mark,--even in\r\nthe branches of overhanging trees,--and must certainly pass days at\r\na time out of their natural element. That such a transformation is\r\npossible need not for a moment be doubted, for there are many land\r\nmollusks to-day that give abundant evidence of having been at some\r\npast time aquatic or marine species. These changes in nature are\r\nconstantly going on, and the gradual substitution of a lung for a\r\ngill is no very startling metamorphosis. [pg371]\r\n\r\nThe littorinas fairly swarm in favorable localities upon all shore\r\nstations. In Maine and Massachusetts the bold, rocky coast furnishes\r\na home for several species. Often the rocks at low tide are black\r\nwith them; the algæ that cling in wet masses to the exposed rocks\r\nare alive with them. One cannot walk about in such localities\r\nwithout crushing hundreds of specimens. Sometimes they will be found\r\nclinging in clusters upon the piling of old wharves, or crawling\r\nabout the bottom at or about the low-tide mark. The best specimens\r\nof /Littorina/ are found in stations where they are bathed twice a\r\nday by pure, uncontaminated sea-water; those living near the mouths\r\nof streams, or where the water is brackish or impure, are usually\r\nsmall and degenerate. They are vegetable feeders, and have received\r\nthe common name of \"periwinkles.\" In Great Britain they are used\r\namong the poorer classes for food. The animal has a short, broad\r\nmuzzle, and eyes at the outer bases of the tentacles. The foot is\r\nlongitudinally grooved, and there is a rudimentary siphonal fold in\r\nthe mantle. The shells are turbinated, usually heavy, few-whorled,\r\nand with a round aperture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Littorina litorea./]\r\n\r\n  ^L. litorea.^ This is supposed to be an importation from the Old\r\n  World--to have come over by way of Iceland and Greenland, and\r\n  then to have migrated down the Labrador coast. For many years\r\n  Cape Cod formed a barrier to its advance, but now the species is\r\n  abundant at Newport, and is reported at New York. It occurs on\r\n  the Maine coast in astonishing numbers, living in vast colonies\r\n  on the rocks exposed at low tide. The shell is thick, imperforate\r\n  (no umbilicus), and usually has flat, spiral ribs. The columella\r\n  is broad and white; the lip thin and black. The general color\r\n  varies from black to olive or to dingy gray--sometimes reddish.\r\n  The operculum is corneous, with the nucleus near the outer edge.\r\n  Despite the variableness of this very common shell (the variations\r\n  being chiefly in the height of the spire), it has certain\r\n  unmistakable characteristics which, once seen, will enable the\r\n  collector to determine it at once.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Littorina rudis./]\r\n\r\n  ^L. rudis.^ A smaller species than the last. It is strong\r\n  and coarse, with revolving grooves and ribs, or smooth, with\r\n  interrupted whitish bands and spots. A very common variety of\r\n  this species is much smaller than the typical form, being about\r\n  one sixth to one fourth of an inch long, smooth, with white and\r\n  yellowish spots on olive. It clings to the rocks near high-tide\r\n  mark, and is usually found attached to its resting-place by a\r\n  bit of hardened mucus. While the typical /L. rudis/ is heavy and\r\n  banded, with a moderately high spire and no color, this [pg372]\r\n  variety is thinner, with a higher spire and smoother surface,\r\n  and has a color-scheme of decoration. It would be impossible\r\n  to disconnect the two, for a large series of specimens will\r\n  demonstrate beyond doubt, through every minute degree of variation,\r\n  that the two forms belong to one and the same species. The station\r\n  of /L. rudis/ is much the same as that of /L. litorea/, but the\r\n  smaller colored variety of /rudis/ prefers quieter and more\r\n  sheltered spots. It is occasionally found on reeds and grasses,\r\n  on the piling of wharves, on large boulders above the line of\r\n  algæ, and on algæ. It has been the writer's experience not to find\r\n  /rudis/ and /litorea/ associated together.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Littorina palliata./]\r\n\r\n  ^L. palliata.^ A low-spired, globular shell with a large, tumid,\r\n  smooth body-whorl. The columella is flattened, curved below, and\r\n  imperforate. The color is exceedingly variable, but is usually\r\n  bright, shining olive, and this is especially the case with those\r\n  individuals that find their station in the dense masses of algæ\r\n  that form so conspicuous a feature of a low-tide scene on a rocky\r\n  New England coast. From pure olive-green to yellow or bright red,\r\n  with revolving black bands, seems a long chromatic leap, but it\r\n  is not too great for the Designer of these pretty little globular\r\n  shells. As a rule, the color of the shell simulates pretty closely\r\n  that of the seaweed upon which it lives, and inexperienced eyes\r\n  may easily overlook hundreds of specimens, all within close reach.\r\n  The banded varieties are less common. The head of the animal is\r\n  somewhat orange in color, the foot slate. The distinguishing\r\n  features of this species are the smooth, globular shell, the low\r\n  spire, the broadly flattened columella, and the orange-colored head\r\n  of the animal. It is found on /Fucus/ between tides, and often\r\n  associated with /L. rudis/, on the whole coast north of New Jersey.\r\n  The three preceding species are distinctly boreal in their range,\r\n  but their place is taken in southern Atlantic waters of the United\r\n  States by the following exceedingly common species:\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Littorina irrorata./]\r\n\r\n  ^L. irrorata.^ A solid, robust shell, which attains a length of\r\n  about one inch. It is in many respects suggestive of /L. litorea/,\r\n  its Northern relative, but the spire is higher, with straighter\r\n  outlines, and the apex is acute. The surface is ornamented with\r\n  closely set, revolving ribs; the sutures are indistinct; the lip\r\n  is thin, though thickened just within; and the color is whitish to\r\n  pale cinereous greenish, sometimes spotted with broken brownish\r\n  lines. Within it is white, with a reddish tinge on the columella,\r\n  and brownish spots on the edge of the lip. This species ranges from\r\n  Maryland to Texas; its station is between tides.\r\n\r\n  ^L. angulifera.^ As the last species resembles /L. litorea/, so\r\n  this other common Southern form resembles a greatly developed and\r\n  large /L. rudis/ of the smoother variety. It has a high-spired\r\n  shell, with an acute black tip. It has about six whorls, which are\r\n  variously decorated by wavy, oblique black lines and revolving\r\n  black lines broken into series of dots and larger spots near the\r\n  suture. The ground-color varies from yellow to purple. None of\r\n  the colors are very vivid. Within it is yellowish-white. This\r\n  species has a much thinner and more delicate shell than any of\r\n  the littorinas thus far considered. It is common on the piling of\r\n  wharves and in sheltered nooks everywhere [pg373] between tides.\r\n  It is essentially a tropical species of very wide and extended\r\n  range, but it does not occur north of St. Augustine. At Tampa it\r\n  has been found in vast numbers. (Plate LXIX.)\r\n\r\n  The California coast furnishes two more species of /Littorina/.\r\n  Their station is among the rocks between tides, and their habits\r\n  are quite the same as those of the east-coast species.\r\n\r\n  ^L. scutulata.^ In this species the color is of various shades,\r\n  generally dark gray, mottled with white spots. A good-sized\r\n  specimen measures one half of an inch in length. The spire is high;\r\n  the columella flattened, broad; the shell is purplish-white within\r\n  the aperture. (Plate LXIX.)\r\n\r\n  ^L. planaxis.^ Somewhat larger than the last; wider; with a lower\r\n  spire; grayish in color, sometimes speckled with white; chest\r\n  nut-brown within. The columella is remarkably flattened, and a\r\n  portion of the whorl next bordering the columella is excavated as\r\n  though eaten away by the animal. These two species are often found\r\n  associated on the rocks. (Plate LXIX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Lacuna^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Lacuna vincta./]\r\n\r\nClosely allied to /Littorina/ is the genus /Lacuna/, one species of\r\nwhich, ^L. vincta^, is very abundant on the New England coast. A\r\ncurious and distinguishing feature of this genus is the umbilicus,\r\nwhich forms a lengthened groove along the columella. /L. vincta/\r\nrarely exceeds one half of an inch in length, and is thin, with a\r\npointed spire of five whorls. It is either of a uniform horn-color,\r\nor purplish, or banded with chestnut. It may best be found upon\r\nmarine plants in sheltered places, or may sometimes be gathered in\r\nquantity from the roots of /Laminaria/ washed in by storms.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Tectarius^\r\n\r\nThe specific representatives of this genus are mostly tropical. ^T.\r\nnodulosus^ is abundant in Florida. It is about one half of an inch\r\nlong, and has the flattened columella and round mouth characteristic\r\nof /Littorina/. It is decorated somewhat elaborately by revolving\r\nrows of nodules which cover the entire shell. Its station and habits\r\nare the same as those of /Littorina/.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CERITHIIDÆ~\r\n\r\nIn this family we meet with a somewhat new type of shell--the long,\r\nturriculate shell, with many whorls and with a channeled [pg374]\r\naperture. The /Cerithiidæ/ include a large number of genera, mostly\r\ntropical in distribution. Their shells are usually highly ornamented\r\nin various schemes of sculpture, but they lack beauty in color. The\r\nanimal is provided with a siphon, as is indicated by the anterior\r\ncanal of the shell. The operculum is corneous, with a nearly central\r\nnucleus.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cerithium^\r\n\r\n  ^C. floridanum.^ A very common species on the west coast of\r\n  Florida, also sparingly found at Hatteras. It has eight or ten\r\n  whorls, a gradually tapering spire, and a sharp apex; the aperture\r\n  is oblong, with a deeply cut anterior canal projected to the left\r\n  and backward (when the specimen is held apex up, with the aperture\r\n  toward the observer). The sculpture is elaborate, consisting of\r\n  many rows of revolving ribs, and close to the suture there are\r\n  circling rows of nodes. There is a curious hump just to the left\r\n  of the aperture, which is quite characteristic of the genus. The\r\n  color is whitish-gray; the length one and a quarter to one and a\r\n  half inches. Station, shallow water in lagoons and sheltered spots.\r\n  (Plate LXIX.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. muscarum.^ Another Floridian species, somewhat smaller than the\r\n  last (one inch in length). It has heavy, prominent, transverse ribs\r\n  crossed by circling rows of chestnut spots, one heavy revolving\r\n  rib around the base; eight or nine whorls; a high-tapering spire;\r\n  and a sharp apex. The aperture is oblong, with the anterior canal\r\n  projecting to the left. The columella is arched; the color shining\r\n  gray to very light purplish. This very pretty little shell may be\r\n  gathered literally by the shovelful all along the west Florida\r\n  coast in sheltered spots, on sandy and shallow bottoms. (Plate\r\n  LXIX.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. minimum.^ A still smaller Floridian shell, with jet-black\r\n  aperture and anterior canal projecting horizontally to the left.\r\n  The sculpture-plan is of revolving ribs and a series of white\r\n  granules just below the sutures. Its station is the same as that of\r\n  the last. Often the bottom of a lagoon will seem to be literally\r\n  paved with these somber-hued little shells. From Tampa Bay to\r\n  Charlotte Harbor they are very abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERA ^Bittium^, ^Triforis^\r\n\r\nThese are allied genera, having numerous species upon our coasts, but\r\nthe shells are so small that the inexpert collector is not likely to\r\nnotice them. Hosts of these minute, turreted, decussated, blackish\r\nshells are to be found on the wiry grasses of salt-marshes. They are\r\nalso found on algæ at low-water mark. In /Triforis/ the whorls turn\r\nto the left. Range from Cape Cod to South Carolina. [pg375]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cerithidea^\r\n\r\n  ^C. scalariformis.^ This species has the suggestive outlines of the\r\n  family, but the aperture is simpler. The outer lip is considerably\r\n  thickened, sinuous, and yellow; there is a very slight notch at the\r\n  angle of the columella, and the lip serves for an anterior canal.\r\n  The apex is wanting by reason of the usual truncation of two or\r\n  three whorls of the spire. There are revolving ribs on the base;\r\n  longitudinal ribs elsewhere. The color is a dingy drab; within,\r\n  brownish-yellow. It is found in brackish water in Georgia and\r\n  Florida. This species is said to suspend itself from overhanging\r\n  vegetation by means of glutinous filaments. It may remain out of\r\n  water for an almost indefinite time. (Plate LXIX.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. sacrata.^ A species very common on the mud-flats of San\r\n  Francisco Bay. It is a high-spired shell of ten heavily ribbed\r\n  whorls, with a series of revolving ribs on the body-whorl. The\r\n  outer lip is sinuous, and the columella is slightly twisted. It is\r\n  nacreous and brown within, dingy blue-black without. Length one\r\n  inch to an inch and a quarter. (Plate LXIX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~VERMETIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Vermicularia^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Vermicularia spirata./]\r\n\r\n  ^V. spirata.^ This is a very curious creature when considered from\r\n  the point of view of the gasteropod mollusk. It seems at first as\r\n  though it would be better to regard it as a worm which had created\r\n  for itself a calcareous covering. But it is a true prosobranch\r\n  notwithstanding the fact that it has departed widely from the\r\n  conventional design in the fashioning of its shell. At first the\r\n  shell starts out in a regular form, and then the whorls become\r\n  separated, finally wandering about in a seemingly aimless manner.\r\n  The irregular prolongation sometimes measures ten inches in length.\r\n  The animal is in no way remarkable except in having the viscera\r\n  greatly elongated and the foot very short and broad. The color of\r\n  the animal is light brown with black spots; the shell-color is\r\n  rufous or ashy-white. Shells of this genus are often found grouped\r\n  together in an inextricable mass. It is found in shallow water from\r\n  New England to Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~STROMBIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThis is a particularly interesting family, but it is tropical, and is\r\nrepresented on the shores of the United States by only one [pg376]\r\ngenus, /Strombus/, of which we have but a few species. /Strombus/\r\nis a scavenger,--a buzzard among mollusks,--and its sense of smell\r\nis evidently very acute. Its eyes are much more highly developed\r\nthan the usual gasteropod visual organs, and they are placed at\r\nthe tip-ends of two very substantial eye-stalks or-pedicels. The\r\ntentacles are slender and project from the eye-pedicels. The foot\r\nis curiously developed; that portion of it which would naturally\r\nconstitute the creeping-disk is exceedingly small, but the metapodium\r\n(the hinder part of the foot, upon which the operculum is situated)\r\nis very large. The corneous operculum upon its end, which is far too\r\nsmall to close the entrance of the shell when the creature retires\r\nwithin it, looks like a claw. Instead of creeping along the sand,\r\n/Strombus/ proceeds by jumps or awkward leaps, turning its heavy\r\nshell first to one side, then to the other. The shell is usually\r\nheavy, with the outer lip greatly thickened.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Strombus^\r\n\r\n  ^S. pugilis.^ The very common Floridian species, often three to\r\n  four inches in height, with a short spire covered with nodes or\r\n  short, obtuse spines, which are also found upon the shoulder of the\r\n  body-whorl (sometimes smooth). The aperture is long, with a wide\r\n  notch in the outer lip and a posterior canal. Living specimens have\r\n  a tough, leathery epidermis covering at least the body-whorl. The\r\n  color is brownish. The columella is covered with a fairly thick\r\n  callous deposit, and, as within the aperture, is highly polished,\r\n  and deep purple, blackish-chestnut, or vivid carnation-red in\r\n  color. The smoother varieties have gone under the name of ^S.\r\n  alatus^, but the identity of the two species is assured. This\r\n  pugilistic /Strombus/ is a very active mollusk, and when placed in\r\n  a boat will sometimes effect its escape over the side in a most\r\n  surprising manner. The species is very abundant in all the shallow\r\n  waters of Florida. A piece of meat on a string, left overnight in\r\n  some sheltered sandy spot where there are from six to eight feet of\r\n  water, will surely attract them. In Florida, where the waters teem\r\n  with life, unless the bait is protected in a wire cage, the chances\r\n  are that the hosts of crustaceans and fish will make away with it\r\n  long before the strombs can arrive on the scene. (Plate LXX.)\r\n\r\n  ^S. gigas.^ One of the largest of gasteropods, very common on the\r\n  Florida Keys and also occurring in southern Florida. Hundreds of\r\n  thousands of these shells have been sent to Europe from the Bahamas\r\n  to be cut into cameos. This familiar shell is to be seen everywhere\r\n  in the South, placed about flower-gardens and lining the paths\r\n  and walks in yards. It is generally known in Florida and the West\r\n  Indies as the \"conch-shell.\" The animal is used as food in Key\r\n  West, and is very generally eaten throughout the Bahamas. From\r\n  their habit of eating [pg377] these animals the natives of some\r\n  of the Bahama Islands are themselves called \"Conchs.\" The rich pink\r\n  color of the shell is very striking.\r\n\r\n  There are perhaps seventy-five or eighty species of /Strombus/\r\n  inhabiting the tropical seas, and many of them are highly prized by\r\n  collectors on account of their great beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXIX. 1, Littorina angulifera, twice natural\r\nsize. 2, Littorina scutulata, much enlarged. 3, Littorina planaxis,\r\nenlarged. 4, Cerithium floridanum. 5, Cerithium muscarum. 6,\r\nCerithidea scalariformis, enlarged. 7, Cerithidea sacrata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXX. 1, Strombus pugilis. 2, Cypræa exanthema.\r\n3, Trivia pediculus. 4, Trivia californica. 5, Trivia quadripunctata.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CYPRÆIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cypræa^\r\n\r\n/Cypræa/ is one of the \"aristocratic\" genera. Whether the shell\r\nor the animal itself is considered, there is probably no genus of\r\nmollusks which offers so much of beauty and interest to the collector\r\nand student. The genus is a tropical one, and finds its metropolis\r\namong the coral-fringed islands of the equatorial Pacific. Despite\r\ntheir brilliant colors and general attractiveness, the cowries--for\r\nsuch is their popular name--are very modest and shy; they prefer to\r\nhide among rocks, where they may be secure from molestation, for\r\nprobably their conspicuous appearance is a real source of danger\r\nto them. In the animal of /Cypræa/ the mantle is provided with two\r\nlarge lateral lobes, which are reflexed and meet over the top of the\r\nshell; thus, when the mantle is fully extended, the shell is entirely\r\nconcealed. These mantle lobes are often furnished with numerous\r\nforked, tufted, or ramified filaments. The foot is long; there is\r\nno operculum. The color of the animal is often very striking in its\r\nintensity. A description of the cowry-shell is hardly necessary, so\r\nfamiliar is every one with it. A deposit of enamel is made all over\r\nthe shell, and its painting and decoration, usually very elaborate,\r\nis reserved for the adult as a final process in the artistic\r\ncompletion of its home. The aperture is as long as the shell, is\r\nchanneled at both ends, and is toothed along both margins. The spire\r\nis insignificant and is concealed by layers of enamel. In the young\r\nthe shell has a very different appearance, resembling a sharp-lipped\r\n/Oliva/, and its scheme of coloration may be entirely different from\r\nthat employed by the adult.\r\n\r\nAmong the /Cypræidæ/ are many remarkable species. The splendid\r\n^Cypræa aurantia^, a native of the Fiji Islands, is one of the\r\nshells most sought after by enthusiastic collectors. The natives\r\n[pg378] learned its value long ago, and hold specimens of it at very\r\nsubstantial prices. It is worn as an ornament by chiefs and as a mark\r\nof distinction. The well-known ^C. moneta^, also a native of the\r\nPacific Islands, has been very extensively used as money throughout\r\nthe South Seas and in Africa. There are many collectors of shells who\r\nconfine their efforts almost exclusively to this and to one or two of\r\nthe other \"aristocratic\" genera. From an esthetic point of view this\r\nis very natural, but biologically the less pretentious mollusks are\r\nquite as interesting.\r\n\r\nOf the one hundred and fifty or more species in existence only three\r\nare to be found upon the Atlantic coast of the United States, and the\r\nchances are decidedly against the finding of any of them north of\r\nextreme southern Florida.\r\n\r\n  ^C. exanthema.^ A species not uncommon at Key West, where it may\r\n  be seen slowly crawling about the mangrove roots near the water's\r\n  edge. It attains a length of from four to six inches, and is so\r\n  highly polished that a good specimen could be used as a mirror. In\r\n  color it is shining, light chestnut, clouded with purple; the lips\r\n  are a dark, very rich chestnut; over all are whitish spots which\r\n  appear to shine forth from beneath the enamel. Lengthwise along\r\n  the middle of the back is a zone of lighter color which reflects a\r\n  purplish sheen. (Plate LXX.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. spurca.^ Another Floridian species, properly belonging to the\r\n  West Indian fauna. It is not more than one half an inch long, and\r\n  is white in color, but it is so thickly dotted with yellow spots\r\n  upon the back that it would pass for a yellow shell. The base is\r\n  pure white. The surface of the shell glistens in the light.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Trivia^\r\n\r\nIn the genus /Trivia/ the shell is shaped in every way like that\r\nof /Cypræa/, but its surface is never smooth. In the middle of the\r\nback is a longitudinal groove, from which run transverse ribs, which\r\ncontinue around to and enter into the aperture. The shells are always\r\nsmall, never exceeding one half of an inch in length, and their color\r\nis generally reddish or brownish, passing to pink.\r\n\r\n  ^T. pediculus.^ A Floridian species, first described by the great\r\n  naturalist Linnæus. Like most of the descriptions of the earlier\r\n  naturalists, this is very short and inadequate, and would apply\r\n  equally well to almost any /Trivia/. The color is rose-pink, with\r\n  several large brownish splashes on the back. The spire is entirely\r\n  hidden. It is found in shallow water in pools, and on the beach\r\n  after storms. (Plate LXX.) [pg379]\r\n\r\n  ^T. quadripunctata.^ Much smaller than the preceding; rose-red,\r\n  with four conspicuous reddish-brown dots on the back, two on each\r\n  side of the median dorsal groove. Found in Florida. (Plate LXX.)\r\n\r\n  On the California coast are also several species of /Trivia/ and\r\n  one /Cypræa/, but they belong to the Southern California peninsula,\r\n  and are not commonly found farther north than Santa Barbara. The\r\n  cowry is called ^C. spadacea^; it grows to a length of about two\r\n  inches, is highly polished, with white base and sides, and is\r\n  bright chestnut above. As is usual in the cypræas, the spire is\r\n  covered with enamel.\r\n\r\n  ^T. californica.^ A species found at Monterey and thence south.\r\n  It lacks the median dorsal groove, and has a whitish color-streak\r\n  instead. The ribs are white, and the ground-color of the shell\r\n  is dark brownish-red. These little shells, when found upon the\r\n  beach, are called \"coffee-shells,\" from their somewhat striking\r\n  resemblance to the coffee-bean, being flat on one side and rounded\r\n  upon the other, and otherwise resembling it in size and color.\r\n  (Plate LXX.)\r\n\r\n  ^T. solandri.^ This species may be found at Santa Barbara and San\r\n  Diego. It is twice as large as the last species, and has a very\r\n  deep groove in the back and widely separated ribs. Color rose to\r\n  brown. The groove on the back penetrates into the white portion of\r\n  the shell.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~DOLIIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThis small family furnishes two conspicuously handsome species\r\nbelonging to the genus /Dolium/, which range from Hatteras southward\r\ninto the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Dolium^\r\n\r\n  ^D. galea^ and ^D. perdix^. The animal in both of these species\r\n  has a relatively large foot, which spreads out while in the act\r\n  of creeping and seems far too bulky ever to be withdrawn into the\r\n  shell. It is square in front, and, bulging out far to each side,\r\n  tapers to a blunt point behind. The most noticeable feature of the\r\n  animal, however, is the great development of its proboscis, which\r\n  is quite as long as the shell itself. The siphon is also long and\r\n  is curved over the back of the shell. The operculum is wanting in\r\n  adult specimens. The shell of /D. galea/ sometimes attains a length\r\n  of eight inches, with a diameter of about six inches; the other\r\n  species is not quite so large. They are both ventricose, thin,\r\n  inflated shells, with large body-whorls and crenulated lips. Both\r\n  are slightly umbilicated and ornamented with revolving, regularly\r\n  spaced ribs. The ribs of /D. perdix/ are not so highly raised,\r\n  but they are painted with light reddish-brown spots. /D. galea/\r\n  is white, with a lower spire and deeply channeled sutures. (Plate\r\n  LXXI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pyrula^\r\n\r\n  ^P. papyratia.^ One of the commonest as well as one of the\r\n  handsomest of American shells. It is a Floridian species, found in\r\n  shallow water and on sandy bottoms. The animal greatly resembles\r\n  that [pg380] of /Dolium/, except that it has two side-flaps,\r\n  which, when extended, partially inclose the shell. The shell is\r\n  thin, with an almost flat spire and a greatly enlarged body-whorl.\r\n  The aperture is flaring, and is drawn out anteriorly into a\r\n  tapering canal, which gives to the shell the outlines of a pear.\r\n  The ornamentation is revolving, but not highly raised, and there\r\n  are ribs with very distinct longitudinal lines of growth between.\r\n  The color is pure white, or sometimes yellowish, with rufous spots;\r\n  within it is golden. This attractive shell is usually from three to\r\n  four inches in length, but is sometimes found considerably larger.\r\n  (Plate LXXI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CASSIDIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cassis^\r\n\r\nThe cassides, commonly known as the \"helmet-shells,\" are carnivorous\r\nmollusks, which lead an active life in sandy stations, prowling\r\nabout in search of bivalves, upon which they prey. They have a large\r\nsiphon and a fairly large and extensible proboscis. The foot is\r\nbroad and strong, being well adapted for plowing through the sand.\r\nThe shell of /Cassis/ is large, generally heavy and inflated, with\r\na short spire and a short, recurved anterior canal. The lip is much\r\nthickened. Upon the Atlantic coast of North America there are four\r\nspecies of /Cassis/. They are all properly West Indian in their\r\nfaunal relations, but have found lodgment on the American shore at\r\nvarious points. All of them have been taken in the neighborhood of\r\nCape Hatteras, two of them in West Florida, and two in Texas.\r\n\r\n  ^C. tuberosa.^ A large, heavy shell, often from six to eight inches\r\n  in length, with a flattened spire. The aperture is long and narrow,\r\n  with large white teeth upon the outer lip, which is also greatly\r\n  thickened. The columellar lip is ribbed. A heavy deposit of enamel\r\n  to the left of the columellar lip gives the shell a triangular\r\n  outline. A row of very large nodes upon the shoulder of the\r\n  body-whorl and two rows of obsolete nodes below are characteristic\r\n  features of this species. The color is light yellowish-brown\r\n  suffused with pink. The aperture and the columellar callosity are\r\n  flesh-tinted, with chestnut trimmings. The anterior canal is deep\r\n  and recurved.\r\n\r\n  ^C. cameo.^ A species of about the same size as the last, but\r\n  more ovate or ventricose in form. It is coarsely striated, with\r\n  elevated growth-lines, and has circling rows of large, rib-like\r\n  elevations, having sometimes nodes upon the body-whorl. The\r\n  columella is conspicuously ribbed and greatly expanded. The outer\r\n  lip is thickened, and has lamelliform teeth within. Flesh-colored;\r\n  teeth white; purple-brown trimmings. A great many of these shells\r\n  are sent yearly from Nassau [pg381] to Italy, where they are used\r\n  in cameo-cutting. It is owing to the fact that the substance of\r\n  these shells is deposited in layers of different colors that they\r\n  are available for this purpose. There are about fifty species of\r\n  helmet-shells, the one most valued for cameo-cutting being known as\r\n  the black helmet, /C. Madagascarensis/.\r\n\r\n  ^C. testiculus.^ A species found outside of the West Indies only\r\n  at Key West and at Hatteras, where the Gulf Stream has brought so\r\n  many West Indian forms, and left them at the point where it takes\r\n  its oblique course away from the shore. This pretty species is\r\n  smaller than the others just described. It has a low, depressed\r\n  spire; longitudinal ribs crossing wide, flat revolving ribs; a\r\n  long, narrow aperture; and a reflexed and thickened outer lip,\r\n  also toothed. The columella is thickened and ribbed. The anterior\r\n  canal is recurved over the back of the shell, as is usual in the\r\n  genus. The color is bluish, with dark spots. There are square black\r\n  spots on the reflexed lip; the aperture is pink, and the teeth\r\n  and columellar ribs white. This species is exceedingly common at\r\n  Nassau, and plays havoc with the more slowly moving bivalves, which\r\n  it devours. (Plate LXXI.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. inflata.^ Perhaps the commonest species of /Cassis/ on our\r\n  coast. It is reported to be common at Beaufort, South Carolina, yet\r\n  it is not so frequently met with out of the West Indies as some\r\n  earlier collectors would have us believe. Beach-worn specimens,\r\n  however, are not unusual all along the Florida coast. It attains\r\n  a size of from three to four inches, and is a rounded, globose,\r\n  ventricose shell, with a higher spire than is usual in this\r\n  genus. The surface is almost smooth, the series of revolving ribs\r\n  being scarcely raised on the body-whorl. The lip is thickened\r\n  and reflexed, with prominent lamelliform teeth which continue as\r\n  internal ribs. The lower portion of the columella is calloused and\r\n  roughly granulated. The color is bluish-white, glazed, with large\r\n  square brown spots. The region of the aperture is pure white.\r\n  The collector should not remain content with a specimen or two\r\n  of the poor beach-worn shells of this species. In general, this\r\n  advice applies to the collection of all specimens. One can get\r\n  no idea of the sculpturing and painting of shells from dead and\r\n  worn specimens. It is quality rather than quantity that makes an\r\n  interesting cabinet. (Plate LXXI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~MURICIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBFAMILY ~MURICINÆ~\r\n\r\nIt seems like making a long leap to pass suddenly from the\r\n/Cassididæ/ to the /Muricidæ/. In the natural biological order, as\r\nit appears in our present state of knowledge, a host of families and\r\ngenera intervene between these two. But they are omitted here, either\r\nbecause they do not conspicuously occur upon our own shores, or\r\nbecause they are free-swimming pelagic mollusks, which live only far\r\nout at sea and rarely are found on the beaches. The family /Muricidæ/\r\nis an exceedingly large one, including a [pg382] bewildering number\r\nof well-characterized genera. It has many representatives in every\r\nsea, but, as is apt to be the case, the finest and most striking\r\nspecies are tropical. The animal is not peculiar in any way, being\r\naltogether a conventional prosobranch gasteropod, with moderately\r\nlong foot, and the usual tentacles placed upon a small head. There is\r\na retractile proboscis, which suggests carnivorous habits. In reality\r\nthe /Muricidæ/ are perfect pirates among the /Mollusca/, attacking\r\nnearly every species they encounter, piercing its shell and devouring\r\nthe unfortunate inhabitant. They live in rocky and gravelly places or\r\nabout coral reefs. Their shells are seldom colored, except about the\r\naperture. What the shells lack in color, however, they fully gain in\r\noddness of form and in sculpturing. The anterior canal varies from a\r\nmere notch to an astonishingly long channel. The tendency to nodes,\r\nvarices, spires, and varicose processes in general is a prominent\r\nfeature of the family.\r\n\r\nThere are several genera, with numerous species, upon the east and\r\nwest coasts of the United States, but we can do no more here than\r\nmention those which are very common.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Murex^\r\n\r\nOf this tropical genus there are two Floridian species--/M. rufus/\r\nand /M. pomum/. The genus has been very extensively divided into\r\nsubgenera, based upon shell-characters alone. Some of these subgenera\r\nare usually accepted at full generic value, and their substitution\r\nfor the old, well-established name /Murex/ is to be expected. These\r\ntwo Floridian species fall within different subgeneric lines, and the\r\nstudent who goes to a museum to compare his catch with the labeled\r\nspecimens on exhibition will probably be puzzled to find his two\r\nmurices named /Chicoreus rufus/ and /Phyllonotus pomum/ respectively.\r\nBut for our purposes the name /Murex/ will do well enough.\r\n\r\n  ^M. rufus.^ This species scarcely ever exceeds three inches\r\n  in length. Its spire is moderately high, and the aperture is\r\n  oblong-ovate, with a long, slightly curved, and almost completely\r\n  inclosed anterior canal. Through the end of this the fleshy siphon\r\n  projects in life. The shell is most extravagantly sculptured--so\r\n  intricately that it is difficult to [pg383] describe it. Its\r\n  most conspicuous feature is the large foliaceous varices which\r\n  cross the whorls, projecting almost one fourth of an inch from the\r\n  body of the shell. Between each of these varices is a large node.\r\n  There is, besides all this, a system of pronounced revolving ribs\r\n  which cross the varices and nodes, giving to the shell a greatly\r\n  roughened appearance. The interior is bluish-white. The operculum\r\n  is corneous, with a subterminal nucleus. Unfortunately, this really\r\n  handsome shell is usually incrusted with coralline or calcareous\r\n  matter, which must be removed with acid before a good idea of\r\n  its appearance can be had. In color it is reddish-brown to dark\r\n  chestnut on the varices. It is very common on the west coast of\r\n  Florida, but rarer elsewhere. (Plate LXXII.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE LXXI. Dolium galea. Dolium perdix.\r\n\r\n  Pyrula papyratia.\r\n\r\n  Cassis testiculus. Cassis inflata.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE LXXII. Murex rufus. Murex pomum. Ocinebra\r\n  poulsoni, enlarged. Pteronotus festivus. Cerostoma foliatum.\r\n  Cerostoma nuttallii.]\r\n\r\n  ^M. pomum.^ A more abundant species, found all along the coast\r\n  from Hatteras to Texas. It is not so elongated as the last, and\r\n  its sculptural design is much less exaggerated. Between each of\r\n  the varices are two nodules. The aperture is oblong-ovate, and\r\n  the anterior canal is nearly closed and recurved toward the back.\r\n  Revolving ribs cross the varices and nodules. The color is ashen,\r\n  with chestnut tips upon the nodes and varices, and chestnut-colored\r\n  patches about the aperture. The varices are simple and not\r\n  foliaceous as in /M. rufus/; the shell is more globose. Length two\r\n  to three inches. (Plate LXXII.)\r\n\r\n  ^M. (Phyllonotus) fulvescens.^ The largest of the American murices.\r\n  It is not commonly found except in Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Trophon^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Trophon clathratus./]\r\n\r\n  ^T. clathratus.^ A fairly common shell of the Maine coast;\r\n  although it belongs to a deeper zone than that of the tides, it\r\n  is occasionally found after storms upon the shore. It is a small\r\n  fusiform shell, with many prominent longitudinal ribs and a\r\n  produced anterior canal. /Trophon/ is a boreal genus, which finds\r\n  the best conditions for life in the icy waters of Labrador and\r\n  Greenland.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Urosalpinx^\r\n\r\nThe genus /Urosalpinx/ is closely allied to /Murex/ and /Trophon/.\r\nSeveral of its species are found on the east coast of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Urosalpinx cinerea./]\r\n\r\n  ^U. cinerea.^ This well-known species is regarded by Chesapeake and\r\n  Long Island Sound oystermen much in the light of a plague. These\r\n  active predaceous mollusks live upon bivalves, and preferably upon\r\n  oysters. They bore a small round hole through the shell of their\r\n  helpless victims, and then proceed to extract the succulent, fleshy\r\n  animal from within. The oystermen call them by the suggestive\r\n  name of \"drill,\" and wage incessant warfare upon them. In some\r\n  years these mollusks appear to go into partnership with the large\r\n  starfish, /Asterias/, and the combination of the two can soon\r\n  destroy any oyster-bed. The original home of this destructive\r\n  little creature is presumed to be in Chesapeake [pg384] Bay, but\r\n  the transplanting of oyster-spat thence to Long Island Sound has\r\n  introduced the enemy at the same time. The species has a wide range\r\n  from Florida to Cape Cod, and locally north of that point; in fact,\r\n  it may be counted upon to appear wherever there are oyster-beds.\r\n  The shell is dingy gray in color, and its whorls are crossed by a\r\n  dozen or more rib-like undulations, and numerous revolving striæ.\r\n  The anterior canal is produced, and is yellowish-brown within.\r\n  Length under an inch.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Eupleura^\r\n\r\n  ^E. caudata.^ A curiously flattened shell which has close family\r\n  connections with that last described. The peculiarly flat\r\n  appearance is due to the fact that there is a rather wide varix\r\n  upon each side of the shell. It is a small species, never more than\r\n  an inch in length, dingy gray, with longitudinal undulations upon\r\n  the whorls, and a long, narrow anterior canal and crenulated lip.\r\n  The animal is white and yellow, and is notable for its activity.\r\n  Found from Maine to Florida, about low-tide mark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Eupleura caudata./]\r\n\r\nOn the west coast of the United States occurs a striking development\r\nof a group of the /Muricidæ/ of a curious foliaceous appearance,\r\nbelonging to the genera /Pteronotus/, /Ocinebra/, and /Cerostoma/.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pteronotus^\r\n\r\n  ^P. festivus.^ The shell is marked by three well-raised varices\r\n  upon each whorl, which are reflexed backward; between each varix\r\n  is a rounded knob. All is covered with numerous spiral lines\r\n  of sculpture, which upon crossing the varices are frilled. The\r\n  aperture is oval and white within; the anterior canal is entirely\r\n  closed and is reflexed slightly over the back. Length two inches;\r\n  color dingy white. Found on the southern coast of California.\r\n  (Plate LXXII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ocinebra^\r\n\r\n  ^O. poulsoni.^ This has the same dingy white color as the species\r\n  last described. Its plan of sculpturing is somewhat different and\r\n  consists of a series of rounded varices, about nine to a whorl,\r\n  crossed by spiral lines. The anterior canal is open, and just\r\n  within the white aperture, upon the inner side of the lip, is a\r\n  series of five or six little round teeth. This species frequents\r\n  the waters near San Diego, and sometimes grows to be two inches in\r\n  length. (Plate LXXII.)\r\n\r\n  ^O. lurida.^ A much smaller species than the last, being not more\r\n  than one half to three fourths of an inch in length. Very common\r\n  at Monterey and in San Francisco Bay. It is strongly marked with\r\n  spiral lines covering the longitudinal undulations usually found in\r\n  this genus, but which are less prominently developed in this case.\r\n\r\n  There are several species of small ocinebras upon the California\r\n  coast, but they are not easily determined without a more critical\r\n  examination [pg385] than we are giving our specimens. They are\r\n  ^O. interfossa^, a small shell with deep spiral grooves, sharp\r\n  varices, and deep sutures; and ^O. circumtexta^, also small, but\r\n  heavy, short-spired, with scalloped or crenulated outer lip.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cerostoma^\r\n\r\n  ^C. nuttallii.^ A species belonging to the southern coast of\r\n  California. It may be recognized at once by two prominent\r\n  characters: first, a horn-like projection from near the base of the\r\n  outer lip, and, second, the tumid varices alternating with rounded\r\n  knobs. It has no spiral series of lines like those in /Pteronotus\r\n  festivus/; and it has a row of five or six little teeth upon the\r\n  inner side of the aperture, like those in /Ocinebra poulsoni/.\r\n  The anterior canal is closed. It is about two inches long. (Plate\r\n  LXXII.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. foliatum.^ A shell somewhat like the last, but almost twice as\r\n  large, with heavy wing-like varices (three upon each whorl), made\r\n  up of overlapping plaits. The knobs between the varices are much\r\n  smaller, while the revolving ribs, though fewer in number than in\r\n  most of these west-coast murices, are heavy and large. The aperture\r\n  is oblong, the anterior canal closed. There is a \"horn\" near the\r\n  base of the aperture, as in /C. nuttallii/, but no row of teeth\r\n  upon the under side of the lip. The color is dingy white. (Plate\r\n  LXXII.)\r\n\r\n  In the waters of Oregon and Washington there are a few trophons and\r\n  other forms similar to the east-coast genera. These no doubt belong\r\n  to the boreal and arctic faunal provinces, and have spread over\r\n  both the Atlantic and Pacific northern regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBFAMILY ~PURPURINÆ~\r\n\r\nThis is considered a subfamily of the /Muricidæ/, and the group\r\ntherefore bears the subfamily termination /-inæ/. There is no vital\r\ndifference between it and the subfamily /Muricinæ/. The operculum in\r\nthe /Purpurinæ/ has a lateral nucleus instead of a subterminal one,\r\nbut beyond this there are no essential differences. The shell of the\r\npurpuras is generally heavy and solid, being adapted to a life among\r\nrocks which are exposed to the beating of the surf. There is a lack\r\nof that extravagant sculptural design so characteristic of the true\r\nmurices, most of the purpuras being comparatively smooth, in order,\r\nno doubt, that they may offer as little resistance as possible to the\r\nrushing, seething waters of exposed rocky shores.\r\n\r\nThe /Purpurinæ/, like some of the murices, when mutilated, exude a\r\nreddish-purple fluid. On account of this, the ancient Romans used to\r\ngather great quantities of certain Mediterranean forms belonging to\r\nthese families, place them in large mortars, [pg386] and grind them\r\nup, shell and all. A garment dipped in the mixture and then exposed\r\nto the sun would receive a rich purple dye. This was the basis of the\r\nfamous \"Tyrian purple.\" The process was lost, and was rediscovered\r\nmany centuries later, but it was long ago abandoned in favor of the\r\nfar superior modern chemical dyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Purpura^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Purpura lapillus./]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The same; a younger specimen.]\r\n\r\n  ^P. lapillus.^ No one who has ever spent an observant hour among\r\n  the rocks at low tide, on the shores of Massachusetts or Maine,\r\n  has failed to notice the myriads of /P. lapillus/ clinging to\r\n  the barnacle-covered boulders, or slowly creeping about in the\r\n  tide-pools. This rather pretty little mollusk is a native of Great\r\n  Britain, and there attains its greatest development and exhibits\r\n  best its marvelous range of variation. It is presumed to be an\r\n  immigrant in American waters, having found its way across the sea\r\n  by Iceland and Greenland, and thence down the coast. As it is a\r\n  cold-water animal, and can only survive in open, rocky stations,\r\n  it will probably never pass south of New York. It is difficult\r\n  to describe this well-known species because it is so extremely\r\n  variable. There is an individuality about the species which causes\r\n  it to be recognized at once, yet its details are elusive. It is\r\n  never more than one and a half inches long (in the United States),\r\n  and varies in color from white through yellow to chocolate. Often\r\n  it is banded in yellow or brown. Near the only sand-beach of Bar\r\n  Harbor is a colony with vermilion bands. The shell varies from a\r\n  smooth to an exceedingly rough exterior, the latter being caused by\r\n  raised scales along the lines of growth, which make the shell even\r\n  prickly to the touch. Of this latter form there is a large colony\r\n  on Campobello Island. Numerous coarse revolving ridges are common.\r\n  The columella is flattened and smooth, and its lower portion is\r\n  a little twisted. The anterior canal is short. /P. lapillus/ has\r\n  been accused of attacking clams and boring their shells, as does\r\n  the predaceous /Urosalpinx cinerea/, but the accusation is not well\r\n  founded. /Purpura/ is carnivorous, and no doubt destroys many young\r\n  barnacles; but with its short and small foot it would find great\r\n  difficulty in digging in the sand for clams.\r\n\r\n  In Florida waters there are several purpuras, which properly belong\r\n  to the West Indian fauna, but enjoy an extensive range.\r\n\r\n  ^P. patula.^ This species has a rounded body-whorl, and sometimes a\r\n  low spire, which give it much the appearance of a large limpet. Its\r\n  back is decorated with rows of nodules in regular order, forming\r\n  a spiral series. The chief point of distinction is the deeply\r\n  excavated, broadened, and flattened columella-lip of salmon-color.\r\n  A portion of the whorl itself is worn down and made smooth by being\r\n  dragged over sharp coral rocks, revealing underneath the rough,\r\n  incrusted exterior, a transparent colorless shelly substance. Dark\r\n  and chestnut-colored [pg387] patches and spots adorn the outer\r\n  lip. The shell is from two to two and a half inches long. (Plate\r\n  LXXIII.)\r\n\r\n  ^P. hæmastoma.^ Like its relative, /P. lapillus/ of Northern\r\n  waters, this species is so variable as almost to defy description.\r\n  The form that usually occurs from Hatteras to Florida is of a\r\n  bluish-gray color, and is indistinctly encircled with narrow yellow\r\n  zones, which are crossed by somewhat vague longitudinal waves of\r\n  black. The columella and outer lip and interior are orange-yellow.\r\n  The spire is moderately high, with a sharp apex. The whorls are\r\n  noduled upon the shoulder. There are revolving grooves throughout,\r\n  even within the aperture. A Texan variety of this species has\r\n  a much more elevated spire, with channeled sutures, and small\r\n  aperture of bright salmon-color.\r\n\r\n  Upon the Californian coast there are three species of /Purpura/,\r\n  which markedly resemble the /P. lapillus/ of the Maine shores.\r\n  Their extreme variability has given rise to much confusion in their\r\n  nomenclature; the multitude of names given by numerous authors to\r\n  the varietal forms of these three species constitute a list of\r\n  synonyms which is appalling to the systematic student.\r\n\r\n  ^P. crispata.^ With very few modifications, a description of /P.\r\n  lapillus/ would apply to this species, which occurs commonly at San\r\n  Francisco and ranges north. /Crispata/ is possibly heavier, with a\r\n  smaller aperture, and with four or five round teeth upon the inner\r\n  white surface of the thickened outer lip. It ranges in color from\r\n  pure white to dark brown and is sometimes banded. The surface may\r\n  be smooth or rough, and is sometimes ruffled all over with wrinkled\r\n  frills. Length one and a half inches. Its habits and station are\r\n  much the same as those of /P. lapillus/, of which it is possibly\r\n  a descendant, somewhat modified by changed environment. (Plate\r\n  LXXIII.)\r\n\r\n  ^P. lima.^ A less common species, with rounded whorls and channeled\r\n  suture, and about fifteen spiral grooves upon the whorls. The color\r\n  is light brown; the length from one quarter of an inch to one inch.\r\n\r\n  ^P. saxicola.^ A shell exceedingly abundant along the whole\r\n  Californian coast, living under quite the same conditions as the\r\n  purpuras already described. It is smaller than the last two, being\r\n  always less than an inch in length. It also runs through the gamut\r\n  of variations as to color-scheme and sculpturing, but always\r\n  preserves a certain individuality. There is a tendency to a small\r\n  umbilicus; the outer lip is sharp; the columella is flattened and\r\n  slightly twisted; and anterior canal is short, and bears to the\r\n  left. A smaller aperture, with relatively thicker shell, seems to\r\n  be all that distinguishes it from the smaller varieties of the\r\n  east-coast species. (Plate LXXIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Monoceras^\r\n\r\nThis genus, which is very closely allied to /Purpura/, is almost\r\nwholly confined to the west coast of the United States. The name is\r\ngiven on account of a peculiarity, which has, however, already been\r\nnoticed in /Cerostoma/, namely, a horn-like projection from the basal\r\nportion of the outer lip. In all other respects this genus is nothing\r\nbut a true /Purpura/. [pg388]\r\n\r\n  ^M. lapilloides.^ The shell in this species is about an inch in\r\n  length, and has markings which give it a striking resemblance to\r\n  granite. A row of small round denticles upon the inner surface\r\n  of the lip is a characteristic already noticed in some of the\r\n  west-coast murices. Their station is the same as that of the\r\n  purpuras--between the tides on rocky, exposed shores. (Plate\r\n  LXXIII.)\r\n\r\n  ^M. engonatum.^ This species has sharply ridged whorls, and\r\n  revolving ribs with wavy growth-lines between them. In other\r\n  respects it is almost identical with the last described. It is\r\n  often found mingled with the seaweed which covers rocks between\r\n  tides, and, when moist, simulates the color of its surroundings.\r\n  (Plate LXXIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Chorus^\r\n\r\n  ^C. belcheri.^ This family cannot well be left without at least\r\n  a mention of this large and rather handsome species. /Chorus/ is\r\n  a genus of but few species, confined to the Pacific shores of\r\n  North and South America. This particular species does not reach as\r\n  far north as San Francisco, but may be taken at low tide in the\r\n  vicinity of San Diego. The prominent feature of the shell is the\r\n  posterior canal, which, being abandoned as the growth of the shell\r\n  continues, leaves a series of hollow, folded spiny processes upon\r\n  the shoulder of the body-whorl, which appear like jagged points\r\n  upon the spire. (Plate LXXIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~COLUMBELLIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThis is a large family of small but often exceedingly beautiful\r\nshells. Their distribution is mostly tropical, but the list of\r\nNorth American species is a very generous one indeed if the\r\ndeeper-water forms are included. The animal is quite the same as in\r\nthe /Buccinidæ/, to be described later. (See also description of\r\n/Buccinum undatum/ on page 330.) The shells are usually quite solid,\r\nwith a long, narrow slit for an aperture; the outer lip is thickened\r\non the inside, especially about the middle portion, and is deeply\r\ntoothed; and the lower portion of the columellar lip is also ribbed\r\nor toothed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Columbella^\r\n\r\n  ^C. mercatoria.^ This Antillean species is found in Florida, and\r\n  is one of the gems among the American shallow-water shells. Its\r\n  height is about one half of an inch. It is decorated with revolving\r\n  grooves and with a variously patterned color-scheme of broken\r\n  yellow or reddish [pg389] lines on a white background, or of\r\n  white splotches on a brownish background. (Plate LXXIV.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE LXXIII. 1, Purpura patula. 4, Monoceras\r\n  lapilloides. 2, Purpura crispata. 5, Monoceras engonatum. 3,\r\n  Purpura saxicola, enlarged. 6, Chorus belcheri.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE LXXIV. 1, Columbella mercatoria, enlarged.\r\n  4, Nassa fossata, about natural size. 2, Columbella (Amphissa)\r\n  corrugata, enlarged. 5, Nassa mendica, enlarged. 3, Columbella\r\n  (Astyris) gausapata, much enlarged. 6, Nassa perpinguis, enlarged.\r\n  7, Nassa tegula, enlarged. 8, Siphonalia kellettii, reduced. 9,\r\n  Tritonidea tincta.]\r\n\r\n  ^C. (Anachis) avara^, and the variety ^C. similis^. These rather\r\n  slender shells, about one half to three fifths of an inch long,\r\n  occur from Florida northward to Cape Cod. The upper whorls are\r\n  smooth, the lower ones are undulated with vertical costæ (ten\r\n  to thirteen), and the body-whorl is encircled below the middle\r\n  by a series of revolving, closely set grooves. The aperture is\r\n  typical of the genus, though less strongly marked by internal\r\n  callosity on the outer lip and with less prominent teeth than in\r\n  /C. mercatoria/. The greater development of the revolving grooves,\r\n  which spread over the entire surface of the body-whorl and cross\r\n  the costæ, producing a granulated surface, constitutes the variety\r\n  /C. similis/. The color is brownish, with white reticulations.\r\n  This species is to be found in considerable abundance in sandy mud\r\n  and among stones and algæ about low-water mark. At New Bedford and\r\n  Martha's Vineyard, and on Cape Cod, it may always be taken. It is\r\n  also common at Norfolk and along the Virginia and Georgia coasts.\r\n\r\n  ^C. (Astyris) lunata.^ One of the characteristic eastern-coast\r\n  shells, which, like the last species, ranges from Cape Ann in\r\n  Massachusetts to the West Indies. It occurs about low-tide mark\r\n  and just below, upon stones and algæ, or crawling about on a soft\r\n  bottom. On account of its generic features, combined with the\r\n  peculiar coloration, the species cannot be mistaken. The latter is\r\n  a ground of reddish-brown or fawn, with encircling rows of large\r\n  white or yellowish spots. The whorls are quite smooth. Length not\r\n  over one fifth of an inch.\r\n\r\n  The collector soon learns to recognize the variable forms of\r\n  these northern-range columbellas. They are not a difficult group,\r\n  for once their generic position is established by the characters\r\n  of the aperture (which are constant) the species can readily be\r\n  determined, notwithstanding their tendencies to vary from the type.\r\n  Californian waters also have several columbellas. The conchologists\r\n  of the west coast have preferred to apply to their shells, and\r\n  indeed to employ in general use, a large number of subgeneric names\r\n  in place of the ordinarily accepted generic ones. The result of\r\n  this is to confuse at first the student of conchology, who, though\r\n  fairly familiar with the molluscan genera, finds himself perplexed\r\n  when he confronts a list of west-coast shells. Thus the two common\r\n  Californian columbellas are /\"Amphissa\" corrugata/ and /\"Astyris\"\r\n  gausapata/, these two species belonging to different subgenera of\r\n  the genus /Columbella/.\r\n\r\n  ^C. corrugata.^ This shell finds its metropolis in Puget Sound,\r\n  but occurs also along the Californian shore. The aperture is wider\r\n  than is usual in this genus. The surface is deeply wrinkled by\r\n  longitudinal costæ and is encircled by revolving grooves. Length\r\n  one half of an inch; color red, or orange to light brown. It is\r\n  found in shallow protected waters. (Plate LXXIV.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. gausapata.^ This species lives in great numbers about the roots\r\n  of eel-grass. It is very small and smooth, with a rather high\r\n  spire. The color of the spire is deep brown; the body-whorl is\r\n  lighter in color. Occasionally the body-whorl is obtusely carinated\r\n  just below the suture. This little shell is very common upon many\r\n  beaches after heavy winds, but it should be sought for at very low\r\n  tides and gathered alive. (Plate LXXIV.) [pg390]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~NASSIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThese are familiar, and often very characteristic, littoral shells in\r\nall parts of the world. Where they exist at all they are generally\r\nto be found in astonishingly large numbers, sometimes even crowding\r\nout all other mollusks. They are exceedingly active and predaceous,\r\nfeeding upon other mollusks, whose shells they bore through by means\r\nof the sharp teeth upon their lingual ribbon. The /Nassidæ/ of the\r\neast coast find a relentless enemy in the small hermit-crabs, which\r\nattack them, drag them from their coverings, and then proceed to\r\noccupy the empty shells themselves; the torn and lacerated /Nassa/\r\nanimal is thereupon leisurely eaten, a retribution probably well\r\ndeserved. The animal of /Nassa/ (the principal genus of /Nassidæ/)\r\nis peculiar in having frequently a bifurcated tail; or, to speak\r\nmore correctly, the posterior end of the foot is terminated by two\r\nappendices. It has a long siphon, and eyes placed upon the outer\r\nsides and near the base of the tentacles. The operculum has serrated\r\nedges.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Nassa^\r\n\r\n[Illustration:/Nassa trivittata/, showing the animal as if crawling.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Nassa trivittata./]\r\n\r\n  ^N. trivittata^, ^N. obsoleta^. These are the two nassas of the\r\n  New England and New Jersey coasts. The first has a more northerly\r\n  range, extending to the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the other is not\r\n  usually found north of Cape Cod, but below that point as far as\r\n  Hatteras it is probably the commonest shell of the coast. It fairly\r\n  swarms in sheltered muddy reaches about low tide. Little pools left\r\n  by the tide on the Jersey flats are sometimes so crowded with /N.\r\n  obsoleta/ that for lack of room the animals crawl over one another.\r\n  /N. trivittata/ is more commonly taken at small depths in the\r\n  harbors, where it seems to live well upon all kinds of sea-bottom.\r\n  Probably they exist in great numbers along the southern shore of\r\n  Long Island, for the beaches are often lined with their dead and\r\n  worn shells. Over half the specimens thus found will have a little\r\n  round perforation upon some whorl, showing that they were victims\r\n  of some cannibalistic brother. The shells of the /Nassidæ/ have a\r\n  short, ovate aperture, with a short anterior canal. The inner lip\r\n  is smooth, and is usually coated over with a more or less heavy\r\n  [pg391] deposit of enamel. /N. trivittata/ is about one half to\r\n  seven tenths of an inch long, and is yellowish-white. A series of\r\n  revolving grooves cutting across a series of longitudinal lines\r\n  gives the shell a decussated or granulated appearance. The whorls\r\n  are somewhat shouldered at the sutures, and are white inside.\r\n  /N. obsoleta/ cannot be called a handsome shell by the most\r\n  enthusiastic collector. Its spire is usually eroded or completely\r\n  dissolved away. The color is blackish to olive, with the aperture\r\n  purplish-black. The columellar lip is arched, with a twist or\r\n  fold in its lower portion. It is decussated by crossing lines and\r\n  grooves, though not so conspicuously as /N. trivittata/; sutures\r\n  simple; length one half of an inch to one inch. Old specimens not\r\n  only become eroded, but are usually covered with vegetable mould,\r\n  and are not over-inspiring to the collector. They often live in\r\n  brackish water, and frequent all the inlets and marine flats\r\n  between Cape Cod and Hatteras. Below Hatteras both this and the\r\n  last-named species occur, though not so plentifully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Nassa obsoleta./]\r\n\r\n  ^N. vibex.^ This ubiquitous little mollusk seems content in any\r\n  station, and swarms in all the sandy bays of Florida. It is a\r\n  busybody, always on the move, and its long siphon is constantly\r\n  vibrating. The shell is about one half an inch long and shining\r\n  white, with brown or reddish spots. There are prominent\r\n  longitudinal undulations and revolving lines upon the lower part of\r\n  the body-whorl. The anterior canal is deeply cut and very short;\r\n  the columellar lip arched, richly calloused, and often granulated\r\n  at its base. This is probably the first live shell the collector in\r\n  Florida will encounter. The animal is very graceful and prettily\r\n  marked in color. The terminal cirri on the foot form a notable\r\n  feature--a character belonging to the entire family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Nassa vibex./]\r\n\r\n  ^N. fossata^, ^N. perpinguis^. On the California coast there are\r\n  the huge (for this genus) /N. fossata/ and the smaller but no less\r\n  interesting /N. perpinguis/, also ^N. tegula^ and ^N. mendica^.\r\n  /N. fossata/ grows to a length of one and a half to two inches.\r\n  When adult the lip is somewhat thickened, and the entire aperture\r\n  is bright orange. The color of the shell is ashen-gray, and it\r\n  is marked with spiral and transverse riblets which produce a\r\n  granulated surface, especially upon the upper whorls. The shell is\r\n  ribbed inside the mouth. A deep groove circles the anterior canal\r\n  at the base of the body-whorl. /N. perpinguis/ is an especially\r\n  graceful shell, smaller than the last-named and more finely\r\n  decussated and darker (brown) in color. It also has a deeply\r\n  channeled groove encircling the base of the body-whorl. It is\r\n  often banded in chestnut. Both these species occur in the southern\r\n  part of California only; /N. tegula/ and /N. mendica/ are of more\r\n  northern range. The former resembles the Floridian /N. vibex/. /N.\r\n  mendica/ is a slender shell three quarters of an inch long, with\r\n  prominent longitudinal ridges, and light brown in color, with a\r\n  white aperture. (Plate LXXIV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~BUCCINIDÆ~\r\n\r\nFrom the number of subfamilies and genera included in this\r\nexceedingly large and comprehensive family, it would almost [pg392]\r\nseem that it has served as a sort of dumping-ground for various\r\ngroups of mollusks of uncertain biological affinities. Although the\r\nfamily has recently been reduced by the removal of several large\r\nfamilies, it still remains a bulky one.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Buccinum^\r\n\r\nThe animal is described at some length on page 330. It has no\r\nstriking peculiarities. The siphon in /Buccinum/ is fairly long; the\r\neyes are placed about midway between the base and the end of the\r\ntentacles. It is in general a conventional prosobranch animal. The\r\ngreat majority of the members of this family have a boreal range and\r\nare found widely distributed within the colder waters of the world.\r\n\r\n  ^B. undatum.^ This is the most prominent representative of the\r\n  /Buccinidæ/ upon the North Atlantic shores of the United States.\r\n  It is an exceedingly common shell, ranging from Cape Cod to\r\n  Greenland. It is also found in England and Scotland, where it is\r\n  extensively used as food under the familiar name of \"whelk.\" It\r\n  affects every kind of station and seems to be as much at home in\r\n  very considerable depths as about the low-tide mark. Upon the Maine\r\n  coast it may be found almost everywhere, just below low tide. If\r\n  none are in sight they may be attracted by putting a dead fish\r\n  in a basket and anchoring it near shore. The American whelk is\r\n  somewhat smaller than the British variety, although it attains a\r\n  length of full three inches. It has revolving ribs and longitudinal\r\n  oblique folds. A yellowish-brown, velvety epidermis covers the\r\n  entire shell. The lip is simple, and the shell is white or golden\r\n  yellow within. The columella is somewhat twisted; the operculum\r\n  is corneous, with a lateral nucleus. The variations in this shell\r\n  are so great as to have caused naturalists no little perplexity.\r\n  Specimens taken near large cities are apt to be defective. (Plate\r\n  I.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Buccinum undatum./]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Chrysodomus^\r\n\r\n  ^C. decemcostatus.^ One of the most striking shells of our\r\n  northeast coast. As its name indicates, it is decorated with\r\n  (normally) ten costæ. [pg393] These are prominent revolving ribs\r\n  or keels upon the body-whorl, the upper one being the largest, the\r\n  others diminishing in size toward the base of the shell. Upon the\r\n  upper whorls but two of these circling keels appear. The lip is\r\n  plain, but somewhat modified by the termination of the ribs. The\r\n  columella is arched above; the canal produced (sometimes to the\r\n  left). The color without is dull ashen-white to horn; within, pure\r\n  white. The operculum is small, with a terminal nucleus. The animal\r\n  is the same as /Buccinum/. This species is not quite so common as\r\n  /B. undatum/, but it is often found associated with it. At Eastport\r\n  and Bar Harbor it is abundant just below low-water mark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Chrysodomus decemcostatus./]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Sipho^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Sipho Stimpsoni./]\r\n\r\n  ^S. Stimpsoni.^ One of the most graceful of the larger shells of\r\n  our eastern coast. It is almost identical with the /S. islandicus/\r\n  of northern European waters, and for a long time was considered to\r\n  be the same species. /S. Stimpsoni/ is not found south of Cape Cod,\r\n  except possibly in deep offshore stations. North of that point it\r\n  ranges to Newfoundland, but it has enjoyed the reputation of being\r\n  a rare shell and has been greatly prized by local collectors in\r\n  consequence. It is, in fact, not rare to any one who is provided\r\n  with a dredge and rope enough to enable him to use [pg394] it\r\n  effectively in from twenty to one hundred feet of water. The spire\r\n  is high and regular, with seven to eight slightly rounded whorls.\r\n  The suture is simple, and there are faint revolving grooves. The\r\n  epidermis is thick, horn-colored, and sometimes velvety; the lip\r\n  simple; and the anterior canal produced. The shell is pure white\r\n  within. The operculum is corneous, with a subterminal nucleus. The\r\n  animal is the same as /Buccinum/, but with small irregular specks\r\n  of black. This shell is found from three to five inches long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Sipho pygmæus./]\r\n\r\n  ^S. pygmæus.^ This species has the same range as that of the\r\n  species just described, and often occurs associated with the young\r\n  of the latter. It may be distinguished from /S. Stimpsoni/ by the\r\n  greater number of whorls, the more prominent revolving ridges, and\r\n  the smaller aperture. The epidermis is drab-colored and strongly\r\n  corrugated, inclined to hirsute. The color of the shell is pure\r\n  white. Length one inch to one and a half inches. It is found from\r\n  low-tide mark to very considerable depths.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Siphonalia^\r\n\r\n  ^S. kellettii.^ /Siphonalia/ is one of the Pacific genera of the\r\n  /Buccinidæ/, which finds its greatest development in Japanese\r\n  waters. One of these Japanese species, /S. kellettii/, is also\r\n  found in California. It has the typical animal of the /Buccinidæ/,\r\n  and a fusiform shell white to brownish in color, and three to five\r\n  inches in length. It is conspicuously marked upon the whorls by a\r\n  revolving series of large rounded knobs and indistinct revolving\r\n  grooves. The operculum is corneous, the nucleus subterminal. It is\r\n  found in shallow water to low-tide mark. (Plate LXXIV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Tritonidea^\r\n\r\n  ^T. tincta.^ A Floridian species which ranges from Hatteras to\r\n  the West Indies, and finds its station near low-tide mark, upon\r\n  coralline rock or rough, stony bottom. It is about one inch in\r\n  length, is of a brownish horn-color, and has an oval aperture with\r\n  a crenulated outer lip and a deep anterior canal. An entering ridge\r\n  of white enamel at the top of the columellar lip forms, with one of\r\n  the teeth of the outer lip, a posterior canal. It is sculptured,\r\n  with revolving ridges and crossing longitudinal folds. The color\r\n  is bluish-white within the shell, touched with yellow about the\r\n  anterior canal and along the edge of the outer lip. (Plate LXXIV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~TURBINELLIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS /Fulgur/\r\n\r\nOf the two genera of this family which occur in American waters,\r\n/Fulgur/ may be taken as the most characteristic mollusk of the\r\nAmerican Atlantic fauna; that is to say, /Fulgur/ occurs only on\r\nthe American east coast. Its range is from Cape Cod to the West\r\nIndies. The two Northern species are /F. carica/ and [pg395] /F.\r\ncanaliculata/, both of which are exceedingly common in sandy shore\r\nstations from Cape Cod southward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Fulgur carica./]\r\n\r\n  ^F. carica.^ The largest univalve north of Hatteras, most easily\r\n  recognized by its pear-shaped shell, with simple suture and\r\n  brilliant vermilion aperture. The anterior canal is long and\r\n  open; the columellar lip is twisted and arched, and the outer\r\n  lip is simple. There is a revolving row of nodes or spines of\r\n  various degrees of prominence upon the shoulder of the body-whorl,\r\n  continued on the spiral whorls just above the suture. The color\r\n  varies from ashen-gray to a dirty brown. In young specimens there\r\n  are stripes and bands of violaceous brown, and the shells are\r\n  striate within the aperture. The length of this shell is sometimes\r\n  nine inches.\r\n\r\n  ^F. carica^ frequents almost any sort of bottom. In Long Island\r\n  Sound they are common on stony ground, but they do not attain\r\n  the maximum size and the high degree of aperture-coloration\r\n  characteristic of those taken along the New Jersey shore, on sandy\r\n  stations exposed to the surf. The string of curiously shaped\r\n  capsules containing the eggs of /Fulgur/ is shown in Plate I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Fulgur canaliculata./]\r\n\r\n  ^F. canaliculata^ often occurs associated with the last. It does\r\n  not attain quite the same size, but specimens of both species\r\n  are, on the [pg396] average, about equal in cubic capacity. It\r\n  is pear-shaped, like /F. carica/, and has a long anterior canal;\r\n  but its distinguishing features are the flattened shoulder of the\r\n  whorls and the deeply channeled sutures. The epidermis is brown,\r\n  thick, and heavy. The color of the shell is whitish-gray, yellowish\r\n  within. It is found in the same places as /F. carica/, and is very\r\n  abundant at Atlantic City and along the entire New Jersey coast.\r\n\r\n  ^F. perversa.^ A Floridian species, immediately recognizable by the\r\n  fact that it is sinistral; otherwise a description of the shell\r\n  would almost fit that of /F. carica/, except in the matter of the\r\n  color of the aperture, which in /F. perversa/ is brownish-white.\r\n  The brownish streaks upon the whorls, in young specimens, are\r\n  a very noticeable feature of this shell. The shoulders of the\r\n  whorls are rather flatter than in /F. carica/, but, unlike /F.\r\n  canaliculata/, the sutures are simple. The row of nodes or rounded\r\n  spines which encircles the body-whorl appears in the spire as nodes\r\n  just above the sutures. The animal is jet-black, and frequents\r\n  sandy flats, where, at low tide, it may be gathered in considerable\r\n  numbers, as it plows its way along, almost wholly concealed beneath\r\n  the sand. Large specimens measure quite a foot in length. In old\r\n  shells the color-markings are not so brilliant, the shells being a\r\n  dull, lusterless white. (Plate LXXV.)\r\n\r\n  ^F. pyrum.^ Another Floridian species, much smaller than the last\r\n  (three to four inches), with a regular, pear-shaped outline, a long\r\n  anterior canal, a low spire, deeply channeled sutures, flattened\r\n  shoulders, and no spinous or nodose processes. It is ornamented\r\n  with revolving inconspicuous ribs or striæ, alternately larger,\r\n  and has a somewhat hirsute epidermis. The color is white, with\r\n  transverse broad yellowish or rusty lines; the color within the\r\n  aperture resembles that of the exterior color-lines. It is found on\r\n  sandy stations, in shallow water. (Plate LXXV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Melongena^\r\n\r\n  ^M. corona.^ A Floridian species, named from the single or double\r\n  row of spinous processes upon the shoulder of the body-whorl and\r\n  the crenulated appearance of the spire caused by the continuations\r\n  of the triangular spines. The three apical whorls are not spinous.\r\n  There is also a row of hollow triangular spines obliquely\r\n  encircling the base of the shell. The epidermis is heavy, rough,\r\n  and brown; the aperture oval and large; the outer lip notched at\r\n  points where the spines commence; the anterior canal wide and\r\n  short; and the columella white and twisted, and banded within with\r\n  purplish-chestnut and white. The color without is drab in older\r\n  specimens, in young specimens chestnut banded with revolving striæ.\r\n  Length four inches. Found in shallow water. This active predaceous\r\n  animal must be the terror of the mollusks in Florida. With his\r\n  sharply toothed radula he is able to pierce even the ponderous\r\n  clam-shell, /Venus mercenaria/, variety /mortoni/, and devour the\r\n  soft fleshy parts within. No mollusk, save, perhaps, the vigorous\r\n  /Strombus pugilis/, can escape the attack of this highwayman.\r\n  (Plate LXXV.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXXV. Fulgur perversa. Melongena corona. Fulgur\r\npyrum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXXVI. Fasciolaria gigantea, very much reduced.\r\nFasciolaria distans. Fasciolaria tulipa.]\r\n\r\n[pg397]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~FASCIOLARIIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThis family comprises a number of genera of mollusks which have a\r\nfusiform shell, with a long-drawn-out spire and a long anterior\r\ncanal. The animal is in no manner remarkable; no essential\r\ndifferences are to be noted from the usual conventional type of\r\ngasteropod mollusk, represented in the two families last described.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Fasciolaria^\r\n\r\nThis genus is of tropical range, and contains many species of shells\r\nwhich are more or less conspicuous for their large size or their\r\nbeauty of form. Three species occur in Floridian waters, and all\r\nof them may be taken about low-tide mark on the sandy flats which\r\nare so characteristic of Florida bays and harbors. All of them are\r\nsluggish animals which crawl very slowly along the bottom or bury\r\nthemselves almost wholly in the sand, leaving only the tip of the\r\nspire projecting slightly above.\r\n\r\n  ^F. gigantea.^ This is said to be the largest gasteropod shell\r\n  known. It often attains a length of sixteen inches, and specimens\r\n  are reported to have been found measuring no less than two feet.\r\n  This huge mollusk has a symmetrically fusiform shell, with whorls\r\n  obtusely ridged and armed with large rounded nodes. The aperture\r\n  is reddish-brown within. The anterior canal is long and open, and\r\n  there are three \"plaits,\" or folds, about the columella. The outer\r\n  lip is more or less sinuate, the color is fleshy-white, and the\r\n  shell is covered with a thick yellowish or chestnut epidermis. The\r\n  animal is of a brilliant scarlet color. (Plate LXXVI.)\r\n\r\n  ^F. tulipa.^ An exceedingly common species of Floridian waters,\r\n  which may justly be classed among the \"show shells\" of the American\r\n  Atlantic fauna. It has a typically symmetrical, fusiform shape,\r\n  with gracefully rounded whorls, and is spirally but not deeply\r\n  grooved. The sutures are crenulated; the anterior canal is long;\r\n  there are three entering folds upon the columella; and the outer\r\n  lip is simple. The scheme of coloration is variable, but there are\r\n  two chief patterns, which are usually followed, though they often\r\n  are considerably modified. One is a light-bluish body, variegated\r\n  with chestnut or olive blotches, which are more extensive upon\r\n  the spire than upon the body-whorl; the other is a pinkish body,\r\n  encircled with revolving black lines. The specimens of /F. tulipa/,\r\n  which are found so abundantly in the shallow bays and estuaries of\r\n  the Florida coast, are, for some reason, never brightly colored, as\r\n  are those taken in the open sea. The length is about four to six\r\n  inches. (Plate LXXVI.)\r\n\r\n  ^F. distans.^ A form almost identical with that last described. It\r\n  is much smaller, varying from two to three inches in length, lacks\r\n  the crenulations of the sutures, and is perfectly smooth, save for\r\n  a few spiral ridges about the base. The color is bluish-white, with\r\n  clouded longitudinal [pg398] streaks of olive. Encircling the\r\n  shell are from four to seven black lines. (Plate LXXVI.)\r\n\r\n  These three species of /Fasciolaria/ often occur associated upon\r\n  sand-banks which are exposed at unusually low tides. It requires\r\n  some force to dislodge the large /F. gigantea/ from its bed of\r\n  sand. When the apex is discovered projecting an inch or less from\r\n  the bottom, the collector must scrape away the sand down to the\r\n  body-whorl, and then secure a good hold upon the spire and pull\r\n  hard. The stupid animal will not at once withdraw into his shell,\r\n  but will hang protruded from the aperture like a great piece of\r\n  vividly red meat. To extract any of these larger fasciolarias from\r\n  its shell, it is necessary to boil it for ten or fifteen minutes.\r\n  Large specimens of /F. gigantea/ should remain in the pot half an\r\n  hour. The heavy corneous epidermis of /F. gigantea/ will dry and\r\n  crumble away unless it is rubbed with vaseline about once a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~VOLUTIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Voluta^\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Voluta junonia./]\r\n\r\nThe =Volutidæ=, like the cowries, are \"aristocratic\" shells. As was\r\nstated above, there are many collectors who have become so fascinated\r\nby the shells of a few of these \"first families of the /Mollusca/\"\r\nthat they make great efforts and spend no small sums in seeking to\r\ncomplete their cabinet series of the rare and more beautiful forms.\r\nThe /Volutidæ/ certainly have very beautiful shells, and they are for\r\nthe most part exceedingly rare. The reason of their rarity has no\r\ndoubt something to do with their habits. They are probably largely\r\ndwellers upon rocky ground, where the dredge cannot reach them.\r\nThere is but one species of /Voluta/ upon the American coasts which\r\nis available to the shore-collector, and this is the well-known and\r\nmuch-sought-after ^V. junonia^. The animal of /Voluta/ has a very\r\nbroad foot, and a head curiously divided into two lobes, upon which\r\nare placed sessile eyes. A remarkable feature of the genus is the\r\nlack of an operculum. [pg399]\r\n\r\n  ^V. junonia.^ This volute has never been taken alive in shallow\r\n  water near the shore, but is occasionally found cast upon the\r\n  beach after violent storms. Sanibel Island is the best locality.\r\n  /V. junonia/ has an obtuse apex, a long aperture, and a shell\r\n  from three to three and a half inches in length. The color is\r\n  cream-white, painted with rows of large deep-red spots. In his\r\n  \"American Marine Shells,\" published nearly thirty years ago, Mr.\r\n  Tryon says: \"This is the most rare and valuable American marine\r\n  shell; specimens in good condition sell for from fifty to one\r\n  hundred dollars.\" A good specimen is probably not worth so much\r\n  to-day as when Mr. Tryon wrote, but it is at least worth a careful\r\n  survey of a Floridian beach after a storm.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~MARGINELLIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Marginella^\r\n\r\nThis is a family of exquisite little shells. In point of beauty they\r\nwould rival the volutes were they not so much handicapped by their\r\nsmall size. The largest /Marginella/ is not more than an inch and a\r\nhalf in length, while the great majority of its two hundred tropical\r\nspecies do not exceed one half an inch. The animal is very similar\r\nto that of /Voluta/; indeed, the marginellas were until recently\r\nincluded in the /Volutidæ/. The shell is also suggestive of /Voluta/.\r\nIt is porcelanous, highly polished, and shining like all shells\r\nwhich are covered by a portion of the mantle when the animal is\r\nextended. Forty-seven species of /Marginella/ are recorded from the\r\nAtlantic coast of the United States. The marginellas frequent sandy\r\nor muddy sheltered spots, and may be collected between tide-marks.\r\nIn California there are several species, which are so minute that it\r\nseems hardly worth while to attempt a description of them. They are\r\nwhite and very inconspicuous little shells. One is tempted, however,\r\nto speak of some of the fine marginellas of the Bahamas. The animals\r\nare quite as beautifully marked as the shells themselves, while the\r\nshell of one species is used in jewelry on account of its pearly\r\nluster suffused with the most delicate pink.\r\n\r\n  ^M. apicina.^ The most abundant Floridian species of this genus. It\r\n  is not more than one third of an inch long, with a depressed spire,\r\n  a large body-whorl, a long aperture nearly equaling the entire\r\n  length of the shell, a thickened outer lip, and four very prominent\r\n  plaits on the columella. The surface is smooth. The white, enlarged\r\n  outer lip is glazed or highly polished, and bluish or brown in\r\n  color, with red spots. (Plate LXXVII.) [pg400]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~OLIVIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Oliva^\r\n\r\nThe genus /Oliva/ is one of the favorites among collectors. It\r\ncomprises smooth, highly polished, porcelanous, and oval shells\r\nwith a deeply notched, long, narrow aperture. The columellar lip is\r\nusually heavily calloused and ornamented with oblique folds. The\r\nanimal's foot is very large, and extends laterally into lobes which\r\ncurve back over the shell. In front the propodium is very large,\r\nforming, as in /Natica/ and /Polynices/, a sort of plow. The mantle\r\nlobes almost cover the shell when extended.\r\n\r\n  ^O. literata.^ The only American example out of some sixty known\r\n  species. It is found in great abundance in sandy tide-pools along\r\n  the west Florida shores. It ranges from Hatteras to the West\r\n  Indies, and may be looked for in stations similar to those of the\r\n  naticas. It is exceedingly active, crawling rapidly over the sand\r\n  or burying itself very quickly out of sight, and is carnivorous.\r\n  The shell is highly polished, about two inches long, and pale\r\n  yellowish-white in color, covered with longitudinal, angulated,\r\n  or zigzag lines of chestnut. The spire is short, the sutures\r\n  channeled, and the columella calloused with white enamel, and\r\n  obliquely striated. (Plate LXXVII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Olivella^\r\n\r\nThe genus /Olivella/ resembles /Oliva/ very closely in conchological\r\ncharacters, but the shells are, with few exceptions, exceedingly\r\nsmall, and usually have a somewhat more elongated spire than is the\r\ncase in the genus /Oliva/ proper. The animal of /Olivella/ seems to\r\nbe a degenerate, for it possesses neither tentacles nor eyes. In\r\nhabit and station it resembles /Oliva/.\r\n\r\n  ^O. mutica.^ In Floridian waters this species is exceedingly\r\n  common. It is not more than one fifth of an inch long, is highly\r\n  polished and shining, and yellowish-white in color, with revolving\r\n  pale rufous bands. It has the typical oliva-shape.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE LXXVII. 1, Marginella apicina, enlarged.\r\n  3, Olivella biplicata, enlarged. 2, Oliva literata. 4, Conus\r\n  floridanus. 5, Cancellaria reticulata.]\r\n\r\n  ^O. biplicata.^ A Californian species of considerable interest, the\r\n  largest of the olivellas. It was evidently used by the aborigines\r\n  as wampum or as ornaments, for a great many specimens are found\r\n  among buried Indian relics. This species is about the size and\r\n  shape of an olive. The spire is short, though longer than the\r\n  typical /Oliva/ spire, the shell is smooth and highly polished, and\r\n  the columella is thickly calloused, and has two entering folds near\r\n  the base. The color is creamy-white to dove-color, with a purple\r\n  sheen over all, and purple markings [pg401] about the base.\r\n  Professor Keep speaks of the vast numbers of these olivellas on\r\n  sandy stations along the Pacific coast. Having found a place where\r\n  a \"little stream of water was oozing out from the bank of sand,\"\r\n  he proceeded to dig with a hoe. \"I found them [/O. biplicata/] by\r\n  the hundreds,\" he continues, \"and I had gathered about a thousand\r\n  before the tide came in. They seemed to lie in groups just under\r\n  the surface of the sand, yet wholly concealed from sight.\" (Plate\r\n  LXXVII.)\r\n\r\n  ^O. boetica.^ A much smaller Pacific form, with a higher tapering\r\n  spire. It is brown to bluish in color, and often has yellowish\r\n  stripes. It is polished and shining. Found in sandy stations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CONIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Conus^\r\n\r\nThis is a comprehensive family of several highly diversified genera.\r\nIts most prominent genus is /Conus/, a name which indicates the\r\nprincipal feature of the shell, for it is almost an exact cone in\r\nshape. /Conus/, along with /Voluta/ and /Cypræa/, is entitled to the\r\nhonor of being considered an aristocrat among mollusks. There are\r\nabout three hundred and fifty species known, mostly tropical and\r\nIndo-Pacific in distribution. The shells have many points of beauty\r\nand are often of very high coloration and eccentric markings. Some of\r\nthe rarer forms are famous in conchological annals for the enormous\r\nprices which they have commanded. The rare and beautiful /Conus\r\ngloria-maris/ once brought £43 ($215) at an auction sale in London.\r\nIn all shells of /Conus/ there is a notch at the upper edge of the\r\naperture for the accommodation of a posterior canal. In some other\r\ngenera of this family this notch becomes a more prominent feature.\r\nThe animal has a well-developed foot, a retractile proboscis, eyes\r\nsituated upon the tentacles, and a fairly long siphon. Upon the\r\nunder surface of the foot is a conspicuous pore, which opens into a\r\nwater-vascular system of the foot. /Conus/ is accused of having a\r\npoison-gland connected with the radula and of having shown vicious\r\ntraits when captured. The animals are shy, and remain most of the\r\ntime in hiding, while their pretty shells during life are generally\r\nrendered obscure by a dull, colorless epidermis. There are but few\r\nspecies of /Conus/ upon the Atlantic shores of the United States, and\r\nthese are confined to the warmer waters of Florida and the Gulf of\r\nMexico. [pg402]\r\n\r\n  ^C. floridanus.^ A not unusual shell in shallow-water stations\r\n  throughout the Florida coast. It has almost the exact outlines of\r\n  a cone. The flattened shoulder is marked off by an acute carina;\r\n  the spire is low, but many-whorled and pagoda-like; the aperture is\r\n  long and narrow, and the lip is simple. The coloring is yellowish,\r\n  banded on a creamy-white background, or dotted in circular rows.\r\n  Length two inches. (Plate LXXVII.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. pealii.^ One of the smallest species of this genus, its length\r\n  never exceeding one half of an inch, whereas the majority of the\r\n  cones are over two inches in length, and many of them rank as large\r\n  shells. This little Floridian species is regularly cone-shaped,\r\n  with carinated whorls, thin outer lip, and pagoda-like, low spire.\r\n  The color is reddish-brown with sky-blue spots, or bluish-brown\r\n  with lighter spots. There are encircling grooves about the base of\r\n  the shell.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CANCELLARIIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cancellaria^\r\n\r\nThe last family of the /Gasteropoda/ to be considered is the\r\n/Cancellariidæ/, which has but one genus, ^Cancellaria^. There are\r\nseveral species upon the east coast belonging to deeper-water zones,\r\nbut one well-known species, ^C. reticulata^, is very common on shore\r\nstations from Hatteras south. The shell is oblong and solid, with a\r\nmoderate spire, and whorls slightly flattened below the sutures, and\r\nis very roughly granulated or reticulated. The aperture is narrowly\r\novate, and is ribbed inside. The columella has two very strong and\r\nprominent plaits. The color is white, banded and variegated with\r\nreddish-brown. Length an inch or more. (Plate LXXVII.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS =SCAPHOPODA=\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~DENTALIDÆ~\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Entalis striolata./]\r\n\r\nIn nearly all collections of shells from the northeast coast of the\r\nUnited States are certain specimens about one to one and a half\r\ninches long, pure white, and shaped very much like an elephant's\r\ntusk. They are round, hollow tubes, slightly curved, of larger\r\ndiameter at one end than at the other, and with an opening at either\r\nend. There are two very common species of these tooth shells upon\r\nthe New England coast, [pg403] ^Dentalium dentale^ and ^Entalis\r\nstriolata^. The first has a simple round hole at the smaller end of\r\nthe shell, and is faintly marked by longitudinal striæ; the other is\r\na smooth shell which has a notch-like fissure on the margin of the\r\napical perforation. Neither of these species is, strictly speaking, a\r\nlittoral form, for all the /Dentalidæ/ range into deep water, many of\r\nthem living only in the profounder depths of the ocean. But these two\r\nspecies are exceedingly common in the New England coastal waters, at\r\nvery moderate depths, and may sometimes be found upon the beach cast\r\nup by storms. They live buried in the mud, and feed upon infusorians\r\nand all manner of microscopic organisms.\r\n\r\nUpon the west coast ^Dentalium pretiosum^ is very abundant north of\r\nCalifornia. It is almost like the east-coast /Dentalium/, but is more\r\nslender. The Indians used to gather these shells and string them\r\ntogether upon long threads to be carried about and used as money.\r\nIn California occurs ^Dentalium hexagonum^, a very delicate little\r\nspecies with a slightly angulated shell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Dentalium/, as seen in longitudinal section (except\r\nthe foot): /S/, shell; /Mt/, mantle; /Sm/, shell muscle; /Mh/,\r\nmantle-cavity; /F/, foot; /Mk/, cephalic prominence or oral cone;\r\n/T/, captacula; /R/, radula; /D/, intestine; /L/, liver; /Af/, anus;\r\n/G/, cerebral ganglion; /N/, kidney; /Ge/, generative gland.]\r\n\r\nThe animal of the /Dentalidæ/ is remarkable, and easily merits the\r\nrank of a separate molluscan class. It has no head, no tentacles,\r\nno eyes, no heart, and no gills. It is a mollusk because it has a\r\nmantle, a foot, and a radula. Its position, therefore, is between the\r\n/Gasteropoda/, which it resembles in its univalve shell and radula,\r\nand the /Pelecypoda/, to which it is related by the pointed foot and\r\nthe absence of head and tentacles, and also by the symmetry which\r\npervades its organization.\r\n\r\nUpon either side of the mouth, just beneath the flap of the mantle,\r\nare bunches of ciliated, contractile filaments (/captacula/),\r\nflattened at the end, which are supposed to be breathing-organs, and\r\nare perhaps exserted for the purpose of catching food. [pg404]\r\n\r\nThe entire absence of such important organs as the heart and gills,\r\ntogether with the fact that they are undoubted mollusks, would\r\nindicate that the /Scaphopoda/ are very degenerate animals. The\r\ncirculatory and respiratory system of mollusks is typically of a high\r\norder.\r\n\r\nA great many specimens of the /Dentalidæ/ dredged in New England\r\nwaters are dead shells, occupied by a worm which seals up the larger\r\nopening, leaving only a small aperture through which it protrudes its\r\nlong white body. These must not mislead the collector into a vain\r\nsearch for a mantle and other molluscan characteristics of anatomy.\r\n\r\nSome of the larger species of /Dentalium/ from deep-sea stations are\r\nfour to five inches in length.

Next to\r\nthe /Gasteropoda/, it is the largest class of the phylum in number\r\nof genera and species. The name indicates a \"hatchet-shaped\" foot,\r\nbut in many cases it is a misnomer. /Acephala/, meaning \"without a\r\nhead,\" is also employed for this class, and is, perhaps, a better\r\nterm. /Lamellibranchiata/, referring to the type of gills prevalent\r\nthroughout the division, is another name often used. The popular\r\nname \"bivalves\" is an altogether correct one, for all the animals\r\nof this class have two shells. To the /Pelecypoda/ belong the\r\noysters, clams, scallops, mussels, and, in short, all the /bivalve/\r\nmollusks (the word \"valve\" meaning \"shell\"). The organization of a\r\npelecypod is entirely similar to that of a gasteropod or a chiton\r\nin its fundamental or essential plan, but it differs widely from\r\nboth in matters of detail. If the student will keep in mind the\r\ngeneral principles of gasteropod or the amphineuran structure when\r\nhe dissects his first pelecypod, he will quickly see that the latter\r\nis about the same as a chiton would be were it folded over from a\r\nlongitudinal median line as axis along its back, so that the opposite\r\nmantle-edges would meet, and its various shell-plates would unite\r\nupon either side into a single valve; or it is very like a gasteropod\r\nmade symmetrical, and covered upon its two sides by separate shells\r\ninstead of covered over its top by one shell. The loss of head,\r\neyes, and tentacles, the substitution of labial palps, the extension\r\nand greater development of the gills, the modification of the foot\r\nand mantle, and the presence of certain special glands in the\r\n/Pelecypoda/ become mere matters of anatomical detail. [pg410]\r\n\r\nAny large clam will serve for dissection. In the neighborhood of\r\nNew York the edible species known as the \"Little Neck\" clam (/Venus\r\nmercenaria/), or the larger /Mactra/ of the sandy shores, will\r\nanswer the purpose very well. In Florida, /Callista/, /Venus/, and\r\n/Cardium/ are all available. On the west coast the large, heavy\r\n/Tivela crassatelloides/ is probably the best subject. The oyster\r\n(/Ostrea/) is a degenerate type; and the scallops (/Pecten/) and the\r\nmussels (/Mytilus/ and /Modiola/) have certain special modifications\r\nof their organs which might prove confusing, so these genera are not\r\nrecommended for dissection and study at first.\r\n\r\nBoiling is apt to shrivel and distort the soft, fleshy animal of\r\nthe bivalves, and it is far better to examine a fresh specimen. The\r\nsurest way of opening a clam without injuring the animal is to break\r\none of the shells by sharp taps of a hammer, using great care not\r\nto lacerate the body within by a too vigorous assault. Pick off the\r\nbroken pieces after having separated them carefully with a knife from\r\nthe mantle margin, to which they cling, and after having cut through\r\nthe tough adductor muscles as close to the shell as possible. The\r\nsubject for anatomical study is then prepared \"upon the half-shell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANTLE\r\n\r\nThe mantle is generally very thin, often a fleshy film of the finest\r\ntissue, and adheres to the inner side of each valve. The outer rim\r\nof the mantle is thickened and free, i.e., is not attached to the\r\nshell. This free portion is capable of slight extension beyond the\r\nmargin of the shell when the valves are opened and the animal is off\r\nguard. In many genera the mantle edge is highly ornate, being waved,\r\ncrenulated, or fluted, or is beset with several rows of papillæ, and\r\nis often richly colored. Mr. Hickson, a naturalist, who traveled in\r\nCelebes, says that the brilliant coloring of the mantle margins of\r\nmollusks contributed largely to the extraordinary color-effects upon\r\nthe coral reefs.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the mantle entirely incloses the animal at the\r\nback and sides, just as the cover of a book incloses the pages or\r\nprinted portion. At the posterior end of the animal there is usually\r\na point--or perhaps two points--at which the flaps of [pg411] the\r\nmantle lobes unite in order to form two openings. These openings are\r\ncalled the siphons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1, /Solecurtus strigillatus/, showing partly united\r\nsiphons covered with leathery integument: /s. af./, incurrent siphon;\r\n/s. ef./, excurrent siphon; /SS/, the two uniting. 2, /Cardium\r\nedule/, showing partly united siphons with papillaceous orifices:\r\n/A/, excurrent; /B/, incurrent siphon; /F/, foot. 3, /Scrobicularia\r\npiperata/, in its natural position in the sand, showing very long\r\ntubular siphons: /A/, excurrent siphon; /B/, incurrent siphon.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSIPHONS\r\n\r\nIn some cases the mantle lobes do not actually unite to form regular\r\nsiphonal openings, but in life the free mantle-edges have a way\r\nof adjusting themselves posteriorly to form /functional siphons/\r\nwithout actually coalescing. Usually, however, the mantle flaps\r\nnot only unite posteriorly to form true siphons, but are capable\r\nat that point of varying degrees of protrusion from the shell, and\r\nwhen extended the siphons appear as two tubes. In some genera these\r\nsiphonal tubes are very long; in others they are fastened together\r\nand surrounded by a tough, leathery integument, [pg412] which, like\r\nthe siphons proper, is only an extended portion of the mantle-edge.\r\nThe orifices of the siphons are generally papillaceous. These two\r\nsiphons (for there are always two if there are any at all) are the\r\n/anal/ or excurrent (upper) and the /branchial/ or incurrent siphon.\r\nThe function of the latter is to draw in the pure water to bathe the\r\ngills and to furnish food, while the office of the former is to eject\r\nwaste materials and the water which has already passed over the gills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram illustrating the various degrees of union of\r\nthe mantle lobes: A, mantle completely open; B, rudiments of siphons,\r\nmantle still completely open; C, mantle closed at one point; D,\r\nmantle closed at two points, with complete formation of siphonal\r\napertures; E, development of siphons, ventral closure more extended;\r\nF, mantle closed at three points, with fourth orifice; /f/, foot; /s.\r\na./, /s. b./, anal and branchial siphons; 1, 2, 3, first, second, and\r\nthird points of closure of mantle; /b. o./, byssal aperture.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMANTLE FUSION\r\n\r\nBesides the points of juncture where the mantle-edges unite to form\r\nthe siphons, the coalescence of the two mantle lobes may be extended,\r\nand they may become further united and fused together at other\r\npoints. Indeed, the fusion of the mantle-edges may become almost\r\ncomplete; but it always leaves the siphonal openings and a third\r\nopening through which the foot may be extended. This opening for\r\nthe foot is called the /pedal opening/, or orifice. In such cases,\r\ntherefore, the mantle becomes much like a bag or sac. The degree of\r\nfusion of the mantle-edges appears to correspond closely with certain\r\nchanges in the organization of the animal, and this feature must be\r\nregarded as a very important character. [pg413]\r\n\r\nThe figures on pages 411, 412, and 413 show the degrees of mantle\r\nfusion in various groups from the open to the almost wholly closed\r\ntypes. One (A, page 413) gives an example of very large siphons\r\nunited together and protected by the tough, leathery integument. To\r\nthe right of this cut may be seen the foot projecting from the pedal\r\nopening in the mantle. Another gives the two siphons of /Cardium/,\r\nthe lower or branchial one being the longer. The mantle-edges below\r\nare fluted, and a large foot projects forward. Another shows two\r\nsiphons of /Scrobicularia/, of the free and greatly extended type.\r\nFig. B (page 413) illustrates the ventral portion of a pelecypod,\r\nwhich shows very well the most advanced type of mantle fusion.\r\nBesides the siphonal openings at the end of the long projection to\r\nthe left, the only other opening is the very small orifice marked\r\n\"2,\" for the accommodation of a small, insignificant foot. In the\r\nother figures different degrees of mantle fusion are indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A: 1, incurrent siphon; 2, excurrent siphon; 3, foot.\r\nB: 1, siphons; 2, pedal opening.]\r\n\r\nBefore removing the mantle from one side of the specimen to be\r\nexamined, note the two strong muscles which are at either end of the\r\nbody. These are the /anterior/ and /posterior adductor/ muscles,\r\ntheir office being to hold the valves tightly shut. They are of great\r\nstrength, as any one may prove to his satisfaction by attempting\r\nto open a clam. Through a long series of forms these two muscles\r\napproach each other in position, and in the scallops and the oysters\r\nthere is but one adductor muscle, occupying a central position.\r\nMorphologically it is the survival of the posterior adductor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRANCHIÆ OR GILLS\r\n\r\nRemoving carefully the thin, fleshy mantle, the gills are exposed\r\nto view--that is, of course, the gills of that side of the [pg414]\r\nanimal, for there are two sets, one upon each side of the body, or\r\nvisceral mass, and lying between the body proper and the mantle\r\nfolds. Each set consists of two plate-like bodies with a texture of\r\nreticulated or basketwork appearance. Thus there are the inner and\r\nouter right gills and the inner and outer left gills. If one gill is\r\nremoved and carefully examined it will itself probably be found to\r\nbe double, consisting of many filaments placed side by side and then\r\ndoubled back like a row of hairpins, the filaments being united by\r\ninterciliary processes, or by vascular channels together with more or\r\nless dense connective tissue.\r\n\r\nThe modifications of the pelecypod gills are difficult to follow,\r\nbut the principle upon which they perform their duties is the same\r\nin all cases. The gill-filaments are all connected with a long vein,\r\nand, being hollow, admit the blood, which is aërated by close contact\r\nwith the water and is then returned to another vein in immediate\r\nconnection with the auricles of the heart. There is another function\r\naccomplished by the gills, which in some families seems to be quite\r\nas important as their respiratory one, namely, the office of giving\r\nlodgment to the ova while in process of development before hatching.\r\nAt certain seasons the gills of a number of pelecypod genera become\r\nliterally filled with eggs; sometimes this curious phenomenon extends\r\nto the mantle itself, and more or less to the entire surface of the\r\nanimal. The eggs are first regularly ejected from the genital ducts\r\nand find lodgment upon the body-surface, but usually only upon the\r\ngills, where they remain as in a brood-pouch between the lamellæ of\r\nthe inner and outer gills. When the eggs hatch, the free-swimming\r\nyoung escape from the mantle cavity. Probably not more than one\r\nindividual in a million ever reaches maturity.\r\n\r\nThe figure on page 408 shows the mantle removed, exhibiting the\r\ngills, the foot, the labial palps, and the pericardium, inside of\r\nwhich is the heart. Removing the gills, we find exposed the body, or\r\nvisceral mass, which, as in the /Gasteropoda/, is thickened below\r\ninto the foot. A longitudinal section is shown on page 408, the\r\nvisceral mass being sliced almost through the middle; a portion of\r\nthe gills of the farther side shows below. [pg415]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOOT\r\n\r\nThe foot undergoes great variation, from a strong, powerful organ\r\ncapable of forcing its way through heavy gravelly bottom or burrowing\r\ndeeply into the sand or mud, to the merest trace of a pedal organ.\r\nIn the oyster the foot has become almost entirely atrophied; the\r\nstationary life led by the animal renders such an organ quite\r\nunnecessary. Excepting in a few families, the pelecypod foot is\r\nwell developed. In a number of genera the foot contains a gland\r\nfor the secretion of long silk-like or horn-like fibers, which\r\nare collectively called a /byssus/. The use of a byssus is for\r\nattachment to any object to effect a temporary or permanent lodgment.\r\nThe accompanying cut shows /Mytilus edulis/, a common east-coast\r\npelecypod, attached by its byssus to a piece of wood. Most bivalves\r\nhaving a strong byssus exhibit a feeble development of the foot;\r\nnearly all bivalves, however, show traces, sometimes only in the\r\nembryo, of a byssal gland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Mytilus edulis/, attached by its byssus (/By/) to a\r\npiece of wood: /F/, foot; /S/, excurrent siphon, the branchial siphon\r\nbeing below it and not closed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Pecten opercularis/, showing the ocelli, or eyes, on\r\nthe two edges of the mantle.]\r\n\r\nThe visceral mass contains the liver, the exceedingly large\r\ngenerative glands, the kidneys, etc., and through all this soft\r\nwhitish or reddish mass the alimentary canal wanders about in a\r\ntortuous fashion, finally passing through the pericardium and the\r\nventricle of the heart, and terminating just over and back of the\r\nposterior adductor muscle. [pg416]\r\n\r\nThe pelecypods have no head or tentacles, but the place of the latter\r\nis taken by two pairs of triangular flaps upon either side of the\r\nmouth. These are called the /labial palps/, and they no doubt operate\r\nby means of their ciliated surface to keep in motion the current of\r\nwater over the gills and to the mouth.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, pelecypods have no eyes, but when eyes are present they\r\nare situated upon the edge of the mantle. The eyes are not highly\r\ndeveloped organs, but they nevertheless appear to be very sensitive\r\nto light, for the bivalves which are so endowed will, when kept in\r\naquaria, instantly close their shells when the shadow of a fish\r\npasses over them.\r\n\r\nThe heart lies in the pericardium and is situated dorsally, just in\r\nfront of the posterior adductor muscle. It has a median ventricle\r\nand two lateral auricles, each connected with the branchiæ upon\r\nits respective side. It seems a curious economy that passes the\r\nintestine through the ventricle, but this is the case in the great\r\nmajority of pelecypod genera. The vascular system is closed and\r\nis of a high order. It is probable that \"breathing\" takes place\r\nupon the inner mantle surfaces as well as in the gills themselves;\r\nfor these surfaces are crowded with excessively fine and delicate\r\ncapillaries, which bring the blood very near to the water. This power\r\nof \"breathing by the skin\" is quite characteristic of the /Mollusca/\r\nin general.\r\n\r\nHaving once familiarized one's self with the more prominent features\r\nof pelecypod organization, it becomes very interesting to examine\r\nanatomically every new form that is captured. Surprises are always in\r\nstore, and sometimes the peculiar juxtaposition and relative sizes of\r\nthe organs are a trifle confusing; but, upon the whole, the bivalve\r\norganization is simple and lends itself far more readily than does\r\nthat of the gasteropods to satisfactory examination. Some of the more\r\nstriking anatomical peculiarities are reserved for mention in the\r\nnotes upon the various genera and species common upon our shores.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PELECYPOD SHELL\r\n\r\nAs has been seen, the testaceous covering of the /Pelecypoda/\r\nconsists of two valves or shells which fit more or less closely\r\nand [pg417] firmly together and are placed one upon either side of\r\nthe animal. The two valves are always held together tightly along a\r\ndorsal margin by a \"hinge ligament,\" an exceedingly tough, leathery\r\nsubstance, and they are usually secured the more firmly by a system\r\nof interlocking teeth, which project from the hinge. The opening and\r\nshutting of the valves is controlled by the adductor muscles of the\r\nanimal, by the /ligament/ which binds the valves together, and by\r\nthe /cartilage/, an elastic pad of rubber-like appearance which is\r\nlodged just within the hinge, and is compressed when the valves are\r\nclosed together. Thus, when the valves are closed, there is always a\r\nstrain upon the adductor to overcome the elastic resistance of the\r\ncartilage. When a pelecypod dies and the pull of the adductor muscles\r\nis released, the valves gape open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The interior characteristics of a pelecypod shell.\r\nLeft valve of /Venus gnidia/: /A/, anterior, /B/, posterior, /C/,\r\ndorsal, /D/, ventral margin; /AB/, length, /CD/, breadth of shell;\r\n/a. m./, anterior, /p. m./, posterior impressions of adductor muscle;\r\n/p/, pallial line; /p. s./, pallial sinus; /l/, ligament; /lu./,\r\nlunule; /u/, umbo; /c/, cardinal teeth; /a. l./, anterior lateral\r\ntooth; /p. l./, posterior lateral tooth.]\r\n\r\nThe summit or apex of the valve is called the /umbo/, or /beak/. It\r\nis usually twisted to some extent, and in certain forms develops a\r\nsuggestive spiral figure. The beaks of the valves are the points\r\nwhere the shell-growth begins, the secretion of calcareous matter\r\nbeing made by the mantle margin and deposited about the edges of the\r\nvalves; the growth is therefore constantly away from the umbones.\r\n\r\nThe umbones usually point forward. In many species they touch each\r\nother over the hinge-margin or approximate very closely; in other\r\nspecies the hinge-margin is very wide and the beaks are comparatively\r\nfar apart. The hinge-margin, lying adjacent to the umbones, is known\r\nas the /dorsal margin/ of the shell, in contradistinction to the\r\n/ventral margin/, opposite the umbones. The /anterior margin/ is the\r\nfront edge and the /posterior margin/ the hinder edge of the shells,\r\nthrough which the siphons may project.\r\n\r\nWhen the umbones are about central in respect to the posterior\r\n[pg418] and anterior margins, the shells are said to be\r\n/equilateral/. When the two valves are almost exactly alike in size\r\nand shape they are called /equivalve/.\r\n\r\nIn many forms there is a heart-shaped space upon the dorsal margin\r\nof the closed valves forward of the umbones, called the /lunule/.\r\nSimilarly placed back of the umbones is sometimes a more or less\r\nclearly defined space called the /escutcheon/. The outer surface\r\nof bivalve shells admits of infinite variety of sculpturing and\r\nornamentation, ranging from a perfectly smooth to a heavily ribbed,\r\nnodose, spinous, or deeply decussated surface. The color-markings are\r\noften brilliant and eccentric.\r\n\r\nThe right and left valves may be distinguished by remembering that\r\nthe siphons are always posterior, and that the umbones usually point\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nThe hinge of bivalve shells undergoes many variations in the\r\ndifferent genera. The simplest type is a smooth edentate surface\r\nwhere the two valves meet and are held together only by the strong\r\nligament. Generally, however, there is a system of interlocking\r\nteeth, those in the center of the hinge being the /cardinals/ and\r\nthose upon either side the /laterals/. In some forms there are rows\r\nof fine comb-like teeth along the hinge-margin, with no distinction\r\nbetween cardinals and laterals.\r\n\r\nThe object of these hinge-teeth is at once obvious, for they give a\r\nrigidity and increased strength to the entire mechanism, especially\r\nwhen closed. There is occasionally a saucer-shaped plate or platform\r\njust under the cardinal teeth and within the shell, called the\r\n/fossette/. Upon this rests the internal elastic cartilage.\r\n\r\nUpon the smooth interior surfaces of the valves are always certain\r\nmarkings, which correspond to anatomical features of the animal and\r\nare consequently of considerable importance in the determination\r\nof the systematic position of the specimen. First, the well-marked\r\nimpressions left by the adductor muscles will be noted; then a more\r\nor less distinct line which, describing roughly a circle, connects\r\nthe two muscle scars. This line represents the points at which the\r\nmantle became detached from the shell. In other words, all the space\r\nwithin this /pallial line/ (barring the [pg419] muscle scars) was,\r\nin life, covered by the mantle, which adhered tightly to it. The\r\nspace between this pallial line and the outer edge of the valve was\r\noccupied in life by the free portion of the mantle. Frequently a\r\ndepression in the pallial line toward the center of the valve is\r\nseen in the posterior end. This is called the /pallial sinus/, and\r\nmarks the space occupied by the siphons. The pallial sinus is absent,\r\nmoderate, or deep, according as the animal possessed no siphons, or\r\nsmall or large ones.\r\n\r\nThe length of bivalve shells is measured from their anterior to their\r\nposterior ends, while the height indicates the greatest diameter\r\nbetween the umbones and the ventral margin.\r\n\r\nThe greatest possible degree of variation exists in the structure of\r\nthe pelecypod shell. Every degree of thickness from the most fragile,\r\ntissue-like structure to the very heavy and ponderous tests of some\r\nof the /Veneridæ/ is to be found. There is also a range in size\r\nfrom the very minute /Spheria/ to the giant /Tridacna/ of Eastern\r\nseas, which weighs several hundred pounds. As in the /Gasteropoda/,\r\nthere is fortunately a very close parallelism between shell and\r\nanatomical variations. One very quickly learns to place a bivalve in\r\nits systematic position by a mere glance at the shell alone. While\r\nthe higher classification into orders, suborders, etc., is based upon\r\nanatomical features, the genera often and the species always are\r\nfounded upon conchological or shell characters.\r\n\r\nThe /Pelecypoda/ offer one of the most interesting fields for\r\ninvestigation and study among the invertebrates. Although by no means\r\nneglected, they have not received as much attention on the part of\r\nbiologists as has been given to other phyla, or indeed to the other\r\nclasses of this same phylum.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE PELECYPODA\r\n\r\nNearly every systematic writer upon the mollusks has attempted to\r\ngive a good classification of the bivalves, yet none of the results\r\nis wholly satisfactory. The scheme now generally adopted is one based\r\nupon modifications of the gills, or branchiæ, and has practically\r\nreplaced all the older classifications, which depended [pg420] upon\r\nthe presence or absence of siphons, the degree of mantle fusion,\r\nthe arrangement of teeth upon the hinge, the number of adductor\r\nmuscles, etc. The idea of arrangement according to gill-structure is\r\nsubstantially this: the development of the gill from the simplest\r\nand most rudimentary type through successive stages to a higher,\r\nmore complex, and presumably more efficient type, marks the natural\r\nprogress or development of the pelecypod animal itself. By adopting\r\nthe gill as a guide one follows, therefore, a natural method. Upon\r\nthe other hand, the presence or absence of siphons, the shape\r\nof the foot, the number of adductor muscles, all depend merely\r\nupon the acquired habits of the animal, these particular features\r\nbeing subject to modification according to environment and changed\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe five orders of the /Pelecypoda/ are: /Protobranchiata/,\r\n/Filibranchiata/, /Pseudolamellibranchiata/, /Eulamellibranchiata/,\r\n/Septibranchiata/.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Structure of the branchiæ or gills of pelecypods,\r\nseen diagrammatically in section: A, /Protobranchiata/; B,\r\n/Filibranchiata/; C, /Eulamellibranchiata/; D, /Septibranchiata/;\r\n/e/, /e/, external row of filaments; /i/, /i/, internal row of\r\nfilaments; /e´/, external row or plate folded back; /i´/, internal\r\nrow folded back; /f/, foot; /m/, mantle; /s/, septum; /v/, visceral\r\nmass.]\r\n\r\nThe first includes the simpler type of gill as represented in the\r\naccompanying figure (A). Its filaments are short and not reflected.\r\nThe second, represented in Fig. B, has the filaments long, reflected,\r\nand connected (each filament to its adjacent ones) by means of\r\nsurface cilia. The third type of gill resembles the last except that\r\nthe ends of the filaments of the outer gill are attached to the\r\nmantle, and the ends of the filaments of the inner gill are attached\r\nto the foot or visceral mass. The fourth type of gill is far more\r\nhighly [pg421] developed. The adjacent filaments are connected, not\r\nby cilia, but by vascular channels, and the depending and recurved\r\nportions of each filament are also connected in a manner presumed to\r\nadmit of the passage of blood. This gives to the organ the appearance\r\nof basketwork or network. The ends of the filaments are attached to\r\nthe mantle and to the visceral mass, as in the last order, forming\r\ncavities or chambers above (see Fig. C). This order includes the\r\ngreat majority of the /Pelecypoda/.\r\n\r\nThe fifth and last order is confined to but two rather obscure\r\nfamilies, in which the gill-development is carried to the point of\r\nsubstitution of muscular partitions which form a separate chamber\r\nconnected with the mantle cavity by a narrow slit, the surface of the\r\nchamber having respiratory functions (Fig. D).\r\n\r\nThe collector of living marine objects who has become fascinated by\r\ntheir beauty and who derives pleasure from examining the greater\r\nbeauty of their structures will find a rich field for research in\r\nthe pelecypod gills. But unless he has time at his disposal and some\r\nskill with a microscope, he would do well not to venture too far into\r\nthis alluring but difficult and vexatious subject.\r\n\r\nOur coastal waters are fairly rich in bivalves, but the most\r\nstrikingly handsome species of this class--and there are many of\r\nthem--are inhabitants of warmer seas. Of the great number of bivalves\r\nto be found upon our own shores we can only mention briefly some of\r\nthe commonest species.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =PROTOBRANCHIATA=\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~NUCULIDÆ~\r\n\r\nIn this family the gills are of the simplest and most primitive type.\r\nThe mantle-edges are entirely open along the ventral margin, but they\r\nare united posteriorly in some of the /Nuculidæ/ to form two short\r\nsiphons. The palps are exceedingly large. The foot is also large,\r\nand by its disk-like surface is adapted to creeping, much as is a\r\ngasteropod foot; its edges are often crenulated or scalloped, and\r\nthere is no trace of a byssus. The shells are [pg422] equivalve, and\r\ntheir most prominent feature is the hinge, which is beset with sharp,\r\ncomb-like teeth in two straight rows, one upon each side of a central\r\npit, a space reserved for the ligament.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Nucula^\r\n\r\n  ^N. proxima.^ The commonest of several species of the genus found\r\n  along the New England coast. It is oblique, with a light-olive\r\n  epidermis, nacreous interior, and finely crenulated margins. Its\r\n  length is about one quarter of an inch. The animal has no siphons.\r\n  It lives in either muddy or pebbly stations near the shore, and\r\n  probably exists in countless thousands in all the bays and harbors\r\n  of the New England coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Nucula proxima./]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Leda^\r\n\r\n  ^L. tenuisulcata.^ This species has a longer shell than the\r\n  preceding; it is more produced behind, and is narrowed into a\r\n  blunt, slightly gaping point. The epidermis is light greenish, and\r\n  the shell has a pearly luster within. The outer surface of the\r\n  shell is concentrically grooved; the beaks are smooth. The foot is\r\n  disk-shaped, and the animal is provided with small siphons. The\r\n  length of this shell is about one inch. Its station is the muddy\r\n  bottom in shoal water on the New England coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Leda tenuisulcata./]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Yoldia^\r\n\r\n  ^Y. limatula.^ This species has the same sort of toothed hinge\r\n  exhibited in the two preceding species, but the shell is\r\n  considerably larger (two inches), with a smooth greenish glazed\r\n  epidermis. The beaks are nearly central. The interior of the shell\r\n  is light bluish and pearly. The animal has two slender, short,\r\n  united siphons and a disk-shaped foot with simple margins. This\r\n  species can make excellent use of its foot, for it crawls with\r\n  rapidity, and also can execute leaps in an astonishing manner.\r\n  Found in muddy stations in shoal water on the New England coast.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Yoldia limatula./]\r\n\r\n  ^Y. thraciæformis.^ A much larger species, found on the New England\r\n  coast. It may be distinguished by a rib-like wave extending\r\n  obliquely from the umbones to the ventral margin of the shell. It\r\n  measures over [pg423] two and a half inches in length and one and\r\n  a half inches in height, and is dark olive-green. The foot is like\r\n  that of /Y. limatula/. The labial palps are exceedingly large.\r\n\r\n  ^Y. sapotilla.^ The shell is ovate, prolonged on one side, thin,\r\n  fragile, translucent, and covered with a thin, glossy epidermis,\r\n  greenish in color. The anterior half is semi-oval, the posterior\r\n  portion narrowed and compressed; within it is pearly-white, with a\r\n  triangular cartilage cavity, and sixteen to eighteen pointed teeth\r\n  on each side. In length it is little less than an inch. Found from\r\n  Long Island Sound northward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Yoldia thraciæformis./]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Yoldia sapotilla./]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~SOLENOMYIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Solenomya^\r\n\r\nTwo species of this genus, which are greatly prized by collectors\r\non account of the extraordinary development of the epidermis of the\r\nshell, occur in New England waters. The strong corneous periostracum\r\nof a deep chestnut-color projects considerably beyond the margins\r\nof the valves; the shells are exceedingly thin and fragile, and are\r\nmarked with radiating lines. The two species are easily distinguished\r\nby their difference in size. ^S. velum^ is about one inch long and\r\none half of an inch high. ^S. borealis^, of arctic range, is quite\r\ntwice that size. Their anatomy is similar in essentials to that of\r\n/Yoldia/. These species live near shore in sandy bottoms, and are\r\noccasionally found upon the beach between tides. Chelsea Beach, just\r\nnorth of Boston, is an often-quoted locality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Solenomya velum./]\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =FILIBRANCHIATA=\r\n\r\nThere are several families of this order which are well represented\r\nin both the Atlantic and the Pacific waters of the United States. The\r\ncharacteristic feature of this group of bivalves is the filamentous\r\ngill, that is, a gill with the filaments long, doubled back, and\r\nunited to each other only by ciliary junctures. These [pg424]\r\njunctures are so slight that they break readily when a specimen of a\r\ngill is handled, leaving the filaments free. The presence of a byssal\r\ngland in the foot, and often a well-developed byssus, is another\r\ncharacteristic of this order.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~ANOMIIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Anomia^\r\n\r\nThis is a family of peculiar and highly specialized forms. /Anomia/\r\nhas an irregularly rounded shell, with one convex and one flat\r\nor concave valve. There is no regular hinge or well-defined\r\nhinge-margin, but a raised fossette, or cartilage plate, occupies a\r\nposition at the top of the valves. In the flat valve there is a large\r\noblong hole just under the apex, through which projects a calcified\r\nbyssus, by means of which the animal secures itself to oysters, dead\r\nshells, stones, or any solid object. The anomias, which have become\r\nstationary in habit, have practically lost their foot. The gills are\r\nvery large and curved, while all the organs seem to be abnormally\r\nplaced on account of the huge byssus and byssal muscle. For the\r\nbyssus to pass, as it does, through a specially prepared hole in one\r\nof the valves is an extraordinary departure from the conventional\r\ntypes of byssiferous species. The heart is not traversed by the\r\nintestine. Altogether, then, /Anomia/ is a very curious genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Anomia simplex/, side view. /Anomia simplex/, from\r\nbelow.]\r\n\r\n  ^A. simplex.^ The commoner large form of New England. It varies\r\n  from one to three inches in diameter, is exceedingly irregular\r\n  in shape, and its surface is variously undulated and plaited in\r\n  accordance with the surface of the object to which it is attached.\r\n  Thousands of these valves, disjointed and separated, are cast upon\r\n  the beaches all along our Atlantic coast. They are light green to\r\n  salmon- or copper-color, generally fragile and scaly, and have a\r\n  peculiarly dulled (as though greased) nacre. [pg425]\r\n\r\n  ^A. aculeata^ is much smaller than the last species, and the\r\n  surface of the convex valve is roughened by prickly scales. The\r\n  smaller valve is very thin, with an almost circular aperture for\r\n  the byssus. Its diameter is about half an inch. Found attached to\r\n  stones, etc., about the holdfasts of /Fucus/.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Anomia aculeata/, from above. /Anomia aculeata/,\r\n  from below.]\r\n\r\n  ^A. lampe^, a California species ranging more to the south, is\r\n  small (half an inch), and greatly resembles the east-coast /A.\r\n  aculeata/, save as regards the smooth surface of the former.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Placunanomia^\r\n\r\n  ^P. macrochisma.^ This species occurs on the Californian coast. It\r\n  has the same sort of calcified byssus as /Anomia/, and also the\r\n  hole to accommodate it in the smaller valve. The scar formed by the\r\n  muscle which controls the byssus is curiously rayed in this genus.\r\n  The normal shape of the shell is circular; it is pearly within, and\r\n  of a greenish tinge without. Two to four inches in diameter. (Plate\r\n  LXXVIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~ARCIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Arca^\r\n\r\nThe /Arcidæ/ may always be distinguished by the long row of comb-like\r\nteeth upon the hinge, the total want of siphons (a fact which may be\r\ndiscovered in the shell alone by its lack of a pallial sinus), and\r\nthe solid trapezoidal or round shell, with its tendency to strong\r\nribs radiating from the umbones. The periostracum, or epidermis, is\r\nheavy and often velvety or even hairy. The animal of /Arca/ has the\r\ngills placed in an oblique position; the foot is large and strongly\r\ndeveloped. No trace of mantle fusion exists. The mantle-edges bear a\r\nrow of composite eyes. The gill-filaments are entirely free, there\r\nbeing even no ciliary junctions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Arca pexata./]\r\n\r\n  ^A. pexata.^ An exceedingly common species in Long Island Sound and\r\n  on the coast of New Jersey. The shell is oblong, with prominent\r\n  beaks directed forward. The hinge-teeth are arranged in a row\r\n  posterior to the beaks, while just under the beaks are a number of\r\n  irregular cartilage-pits. About thirty-two to thirty-six radiating\r\n  ribs ornament the shell. The inner margins of the shell are rather\r\n  deeply scalloped; the epidermis is thick, shaggy, and dark\r\n  [pg426] brown. Length two to two and a quarter inches; height two\r\n  inches. /A. pexata/ is one of the few pelecypods which have red\r\n  blood, a fact which accounts for its popular name of \"bloody clam.\"\r\n\r\n  ^A. ponderosa.^ The most prominent /Arca/ upon our Atlantic\r\n  coast, especially south of Virginia. The beaks of this shell are\r\n  very prominent, and do not approach each other very closely on\r\n  account of the wide dorsal margin of the shells, the large space\r\n  between the beaks being occupied by an external ligament. The\r\n  hinge-teeth are smaller in the middle. There are from twenty-five\r\n  to twenty-eight ribs; the ventral margin of the valves is somewhat\r\n  contracted in the middle. Length two and a half inches; height two\r\n  inches. Very heavy and solid. This exceedingly common species is\r\n  often cast upon the beaches south of Hatteras in numbers beyond\r\n  computation. In life it is covered with a heavy, coarse, velvety\r\n  epidermis, almost jet-black in color. (Plate LXXVIII.)\r\n\r\n  ^A. noæ.^ The well-known \"Noah's-ark\" shell, a common species\r\n  along the shores of the Southeastern States. It also occurs in\r\n  the Mediterranean. Unlike most arcas, it spins a byssus, by means\r\n  of which it attaches itself to the under surfaces of stones at\r\n  low water. The hinge-margin is perfectly straight and regularly\r\n  toothed. The beaks are high and are situated very far forward. The\r\n  dorsal margin of the valves is strikingly large, and is marked by\r\n  lattice-like grooves; it forms a concave surface over an inch in\r\n  width between the umbones. The shell is strongly ribbed without.\r\n  The ventral margin of the valves is sinuous and gapes slightly at a\r\n  central point for the accommodation of the byssus. (Plate LXXVIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~MYTILIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERA ^Mytilus^, ^Modiola^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXXVIII. Placunanomia macrochisma. Arca\r\nponderosa. Arca noæ. Mytilus hamatus.]\r\n\r\nThe /Mytilidæ/ are a large family, including the mussels, so\r\ncommonly found between tides upon all shores. The two ordinary\r\ngenera /Mytilus/ and /Modiola/, which often occur associated\r\ntogether upon our eastern coast, may readily be distinguished one\r\nfrom the other by the position of their beaks. In the former genus\r\nthe beak is terminal, that is, it is situated at the very tip-end\r\nof the shell; in the latter genus it is not quite terminal. Aside\r\nfrom this simple feature, the genera are practically the same, the\r\nanimals being identical. /Mytilus/ and /Modiola/, commonly known as\r\nmussels, have acquired the stationary habit and are provided with a\r\nrelatively small foot (in some species amounting to no more than a\r\nmere tubercle); but in place of a useful foot is a well-developed\r\nbyssogenous gland, which secretes an [pg427] exceedingly tough,\r\nfibrous byssus. By means of this the animal may not only attach\r\nitself firmly to any sort of object, but may actually move about.\r\nFibers of the byssus are thrown out, and, as though possessed of\r\nlife, they seize upon objects in the direction in which /Mytilus/\r\ndesires to move, and by contraction of the muscles which control\r\nthe byssus the animal is drawn forward, the operation being then\r\nrepeated. It must be a very tedious method of travel. However, the\r\n/Mytilidæ/ are not restless creatures. They pass their lives content\r\nto remain firmly fixed to some object, and their movements, if any,\r\nare within a very narrow circle. The animal has very long gills\r\nof the usual filamentous type. The mantle fuses at one point to\r\nform an anal siphon, the lower or branchial one being, therefore,\r\nfunctional. The palps are large. One curious feature of this group is\r\nthe enormous extent of the genital glands, which actually appear to\r\npervade the entire structure of the animal, gills, mantle, foot, and\r\nall. At times the whole being is a veritable receptacle for myriads\r\nof tiny yellowish eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Mytilus edulis/, typical form.]\r\n\r\nThe /Mytilidæ/ are of universal distribution, and are for the most\r\npart of littoral or shallow-water range. Some species are esteemed as\r\nan article of food, notably /Mytilus edulis/.\r\n\r\nMussel-culture has been profitably carried on in France for a long\r\ntime, but the genus has not been utilized to any extent as food in\r\nthis country. [pg428]\r\n\r\n  ^Mytilus edulis^ is exceedingly abundant along the New England\r\n  coast. It lives in colonies, often between tides, in pebbly\r\n  stations among large rocks. It is always so fastened by its byssus\r\n  that the beaks of the valves point downward, and the ventral margin\r\n  projects above the sand or mud. The color of the epidermis in the\r\n  adult form is black or a deep blue-black; the shell proper is\r\n  violet. Hinge-teeth are wanting. Length two and a half inches. A\r\n  variety of this species, ^M. pellucidus^, is often found associated\r\n  with the typical form. It is brightly rayed in green and yellow.\r\n  /M. edulis/ occurs in Europe, where it is quite extensively used as\r\n  food. It also occurs (by importation) in San Francisco Bay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Mytilus edulis/, rayed-color variety.]\r\n\r\n  ^M. hamatus^ has a more southern range than has /M. edulis/, and\r\n  is found from the Chesapeake southward. Its shell is considerably\r\n  twisted just below the umbonal region, while its whole surface is\r\n  densely striated. Its color is dark fuscous. Length one to two\r\n  inches. It is found in great numbers attached to oysters by its\r\n  byssus. In Florida it is very common. (Plate LXXVIII.)\r\n\r\n  ^M. californicus.^ A common west-coast species, which finds its\r\n  station among rocks exposed to the surf. It is about the same size\r\n  as /M. edulis/, but has a lighter brownish glossy epidermis and\r\n  several conspicuous, well-rounded, radiating ribs. The animal is\r\n  orange-colored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Modiola modiolus./]\r\n\r\n  ^Modiola modiolus.^ After violent storms upon the New England\r\n  coast, when a large /Laminaria/ is wrenched from its rocky bed\r\n  and washed ashore, its roots will, in many cases, be found\r\n  clinging to this large mussel. The thick glossy epidermis of deep\r\n  chestnut-color folds over the margin of the valves, and the outer\r\n  surface, especially near the ventral margin, is covered with a\r\n  tough hairy growth. Length four to five inches. The animal is\r\n  orange-red. The great size and swelling fullness of this species\r\n  at once distinguish it from all others upon our coast. It is not a\r\n  shallow-water form, but is extremely common upon all beaches north\r\n  of Hatteras. It also occurs in Alaskan waters to Puget Sound, where\r\n  it is known as the \"great horse-mussel.\" Sometimes these large\r\n  modiolas may be found in rocky tide-pools which are washed by the\r\n  surf at high tide. They hide far back in the crevices of boulders,\r\n  and [pg429] are not easily detected. They are not uncommon in\r\n  such stations at Mount Desert, Maine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Modiola plicatula/, typical form.]\r\n\r\n  ^M. plicatula.^ This species of /Modiola/ ranges from Canada to\r\n  Hatteras, and inhabits the tidal waters of streams, sheltered\r\n  muddy reaches among reeds, and tidal flats. It is a dingy-looking\r\n  shell, ornamented with numerous radiating ribs, which are very\r\n  fine upon the anterior portion of the shell. The epidermis is thin\r\n  and of a dirty yellowish-green color. Within it is silvery-white.\r\n  In the ventral margin there is an opening for the accommodation\r\n  of a byssus. Length about three inches in New England; slightly\r\n  larger at Norfolk. There is probably no muddy reach of land that\r\n  is exposed at low tide from Maine to the Carolinas that is not\r\n  inhabited by /M. plicatula/.\r\n\r\n  ^M. tulipa.^ This is the \"show shell\" of the genus /Modiola/ in\r\n  American waters. It belongs to the Southern fauna, and, like the\r\n  others of its genus, it moors itself to wood or other solid objects\r\n  by means of its byssus. It is of about the same size as the last\r\n  species, but is perfectly smooth and of a bright-yellowish color,\r\n  with dark rays over the central portion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Modiola nigra./]\r\n\r\n  ^M. recta.^ A species of /Modiola/ fairly abundant on the Pacific\r\n  coast from Vancouver to southern California. It has a long, narrow\r\n  shell with a dark-brown glossy epidermis; lighter posteriorly, and\r\n  with a short hairy growth. The interior is white. Length three to\r\n  four inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =PSEUDOLAMELLIBRANCHIATA=\r\n\r\nThis third order of /Pelecypoda/ is made up of a number of families\r\nin which the gills are filamentous, but in which the filaments\r\n[pg430] have become united at their ends to the mantle (on the outer\r\ngills) and to the body-mass (on the inner gills). Here also the first\r\ntraces of the higher type of gill found in the next order appear;\r\nthat is, a gill in which the filaments are connected by vascular\r\nchannels instead of by cilia. This order therefore is presumed to\r\nconnect the true filamentous type of gill with the fully developed\r\nlamellar type. As the filaments do not always fuse with the mantle\r\nor foot, the description of the pseudolamellibranch gill becomes\r\nsomewhat vague, and there is some room for doubt whether this order\r\nshould exist at all.\r\n\r\nMost of the genera placed in it are monomyarian; that is, they have\r\nbut one adductor muscle, or if two, the anterior one is very small\r\nand unimportant. The mantle-edges are entirely open, there being no\r\nregularly formed siphons. As a rule, the foot is exceedingly small or\r\nquite aborted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~AVICULIDÆ~\r\n\r\nIn this family there is an exception to the rule just stated: the\r\nfoot is long. There is a byssus, and the gills (by their outer\r\nascending filaments) are concrescent with the mantle.\r\n\r\nThe interior of all the /Aviculidæ/ is of a highly polished nacre,\r\nand some of the larger species have been extensively collected\r\nfor mother-of-pearl. To the /Aviculidæ/ belong the pearl-oysters\r\n(/Meleagrina margaritifera/).\r\n\r\nA delightful air of romance and adventure surrounds the\r\npearl-fisheries, about which much has been written. The pearl\r\nis an abnormal product formed by the deposition of nacre around\r\nsome foreign object, such as a grain of sand, or--usually, it is\r\nsaid--an egg which has failed to develop properly. They are seldom\r\nfound in individuals having favorable conditions of growth, but\r\nthose which are greatly crowded together and covered with various\r\nparasites and growths are most productive of them. The pearl is\r\nthe same in substance as the nacreous shell of the pearl-oyster,\r\nand its iridescence is due to the fine striæ of the undulating\r\nlayers of which it is composed. The pearl as well as the shell\r\nis produced by the shell-glands of the mantle. The value of the\r\n[pg431] pearl is based on the brilliancy of the nacre, the size,\r\nand the form. Luster, or \"orient,\" is to the pearl what brilliancy\r\nis to the diamond. The round form has the greatest value, next\r\nthe pear-shape, and lastly the oval. Pearls of inferior value are\r\nproduced by other species than /Meleagrina margaritifera/, the true\r\npearl-oyster. Many bivalves secrete similar bodies, but as they have\r\nthe nature of the shell, those produced by mollusks having lusterless\r\ninteriors are of no value. Beautiful pink pearls are found in the\r\ngasteropod /Strombus gigas/, the conch-shell of the West Indies. The\r\nshells of the pearl-oyster are themselves very valuable, being the\r\n\"mother-of-pearl\" used in the manufacture of buttons, knife-handles,\r\ninlay-work, and so on. They have three grades of commercial value; of\r\nthe first are the \"silver-lipped,\" from the South Seas, of the second\r\nthe \"black-lipped,\" from Manila and Ceylon, and of the third the\r\n\"bullock-shells,\" from Panama.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Avicula^\r\n\r\n  ^A. atlantica.^ A Floridian species which is often found attached\r\n  by its byssus to large algæ which have been washed upon the beach.\r\n  The shell is reddish-brown, with many white radial lines. Its\r\n  obliquely oval shape, the long wing-like extension of the dorsal\r\n  margin, the inequivalve shells, and the byssal sinus placed just\r\n  below the forward extension of the hinge, are characteristics which\r\n  will enable one to recognize the species at once. The structure of\r\n  the shell is unusual in being so largely composed of organic matter\r\n  that it possesses elasticity near its thinner edges.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pinna^\r\n\r\n  ^P. muricata^ and ^P. seminuda^. Two species of this family which\r\n  are very abundant in Floridian waters and are often to be found\r\n  associated upon the muddy or sandy shores of bays. Like /Modiola\r\n  plicatula/, they attach themselves by means of their byssus to\r\n  shells or stones which lie under the surface. With the pointed end\r\n  of the shell directed downward, they remain almost wholly concealed\r\n  in the sand. Only about one quarter of an inch of the broad end\r\n  of the shell projects above the sand. The edges of the valves are\r\n  as sharp as knife-blades, and great caution must be used while\r\n  walking barefooted along a beach inhabited by /Pinna/. The shells\r\n  of both species are of a triangular wedge-shape and are composed\r\n  of a translucent crystalline matter. /P. muricata/ is beset with\r\n  triangular erect scales which project out like spines. Their edges\r\n  are also sharp like pieces of broken glass. /P. seminuda/ also has\r\n  these raised scales, but they are far more numerous [pg432] and\r\n  much smaller, and are arranged in closely packed radiating rows,\r\n  the scales becoming obsolete near the umbones. The mantle of the\r\n  animal is doubly fringed, and much decorated upon that portion\r\n  which may be protruded from the shell. The posterior adductor is\r\n  very large and strong; the anterior one has almost disappeared. The\r\n  foot is long and slender, but is evidently a useless appendage,\r\n  for the animal's habit is stationary. The byssus is large and very\r\n  strong. Gloves have been made from the byssal fibers of /Pinna/\r\n  mixed with silk. The gills are very long and are distinctly /not/\r\n  filamentous, the adjacent filaments being clearly united by\r\n  vascular channels. A very curious development of the osphradium\r\n  (see page 339) into an erectile process capable of projection\r\n  beyond the margin of the shell is a unique feature of /Pinna/.\r\n  Sometimes thousands of pinnas are torn loose by storms and cast\r\n  upon the beaches. They do not range north of Hatteras. (Plate\r\n  LXXIX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Perna^\r\n\r\n  ^P. ephippium.^ A West Indian shell, also quite common on the\r\n  east coast of Florida, and especially upon the Keys. It attaches\r\n  itself by the byssus in great bunches to mangrove roots, sticks,\r\n  and all manner of rubbish in brackish water. It has a very flat,\r\n  irregularly shaped shell of a horn-color, and is from two to\r\n  three inches across. The distinguishing feature of /Perna/ is the\r\n  hinge. It is straight and without teeth, but is marked by a row of\r\n  transverse grooves to which the ligament is attached. These grooves\r\n  constitute a row of cartilage-pits.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~OSTREIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThis family probably interests more people than any other one in the\r\nclass save /Aviculidæ/. The latter furnishes the pearl-oysters, the\r\nformer the edible oysters, the two thus appealing to two very strong\r\nhuman cravings--those of vanity and hunger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXXIX. Pinna muricata. Pinna seminuda. Pecten\r\nhastatus.]\r\n\r\nFew realize what an enormous business the oyster trade has become\r\nin the United States. The value of it is stated to be over thirteen\r\nmillion dollars annually, twenty-five million bushels of oysters\r\nbeing taken from the Chesapeake alone. The edibility of the\r\noyster has been known from early times, for vast heaps of empty\r\noyster-shells, known as kitchen-middens, occur in various parts of\r\nthe world. Some of them are of such size and extent as to warrant\r\nthe belief that their formation must have required centuries.\r\nShell-mounds are found along the coasts of Florida and are of some\r\narchæological value. The cultivation of oysters as recorded by Pliny\r\ndates from the first century B.C., at which [pg433] time a Roman\r\nnamed Sergius Orata first cultivated oysters at Baiæ. The acuteness\r\nof the gastronomic sense of a Roman epicure is thus described by\r\nJuvenal:\r\n\r\n                    He could tell\r\n  At the first mouthful if his oysters fed\r\n  On the Rutupian or the Lucrine bed\r\n  Or at Circeii.\r\n\r\nThe poet Gay's opinion is expressed thus:\r\n\r\n  The man had sure a palate cover'd o'er\r\n  With brass or steel, that on the rocky shore\r\n  First broke the oozy oyster's pearly coat,\r\n  And risk'd the living morsel down his throat.\r\n\r\nThe methods employed in oyster-farming resemble those of agriculture,\r\nin that the bed is prepared, seed is sown, superfluous and foreign\r\ngrowths are weeded out, enemies are driven off, and the crop is\r\nharvested at stated seasons. The oyster is ovoviviparous; that is,\r\nit retains its eggs until they are partly matured. These are held in\r\nthe gills and mantle folds until the time of spawning, which begins\r\nin May and lasts through the summer months. The larvæ are ejected as\r\nciliated spheres, called spat, and swim freely about for some time,\r\noften several days, before finding a resting-spot. The oyster-grower\r\nsecures many of the larvæ by placing in their way substances to\r\nwhich they can attach themselves. The American culturist strews his\r\ncarefully prepared beds with empty oyster-shells, on which the spat\r\nsettle, and the seed is thus secured; for the spat, once fastened,\r\nlose the power of locomotion and become fixed. At the end of a year\r\nthe shells which hold the young oysters (now about an inch long\r\nand called \"fry\") are taken up, and the fry are thinned out and\r\nreplanted, or are sold to other oyster-farmers.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of their growth the oysters are sometimes\r\ntransplanted several times. At the end of three to five years they\r\nhave attained marketable size, and the beds are then harvested and\r\nprepared for another crop. Some oystermen have several acres of\r\nbottom under cultivation. These areas are obtained by purchase or\r\ngrant from the State, and their limits are as defined [pg434] as\r\nare the fenced-off acres of upland meadows. The business of the\r\noyster-culturist is to plant the young oysters and watch their\r\ndevelopment, keeping the beds thinned, that the oysters may not be\r\ntoo crowded for their normal and symmetrical growth, and protecting\r\nthem from their enemies, of which there are many. The principal\r\nenemies of the oyster are the starfish and the predaceous mollusks\r\n/Urosalpinx/ and /Nassa/. Whole beds have been known to be destroyed\r\nin a single night by the visitations of starfishes, hence a constant\r\nwatchfulness is required on the part of the oysterman. Policing the\r\noyster-farms is another of his cares, for pirates abound, and a bed\r\nmay be robbed in the night as easily as an orchard may be despoiled\r\nof its fruit. Oyster-culture is carried on extensively in Long\r\nIsland Sound, on the coasts of New Jersey and Virginia, and in the\r\nChesapeake Bay. The oysters from certain localities are esteemed more\r\nthan others, the flavor of the oyster being very dependent upon the\r\npurity of the water and on the organisms upon which it feeds. It has\r\nbeen definitely shown that oysters grown in contaminated waters have\r\nbeen the agents of transmitting disease, notably typhoid fever and\r\ncholera.\r\n\r\nOyster-culture has reached the highest degree of perfection in\r\nFrance, where miles of muddy shores left by the ebb-tide are utilized\r\nfor the purpose. The famous /parc/ at Arcachon, covering ten thousand\r\nacres, illustrates the system generally practised. The spat is there\r\ncollected on tiles coated with cement, piled in layers crosswise, and\r\nsecured in crates. These tiles are exposed in favorable localities\r\nand collect the swimming embryos. The rough cement holding the\r\nspat is then chipped off the tiles and placed in wire trays. These\r\n/ambulances/, or /caisses ostreophiles/, placed between short posts,\r\nprotect the fry from their enemies. At low tide the young oysters\r\nare carefully examined and sorted, and at the right age they are\r\nremoved to open areas. The parc is divided into regular squares by\r\ncanals of suitable width, some of the squares having banks and gates\r\nto retain the water of the receding tide if desired. Each man's parc\r\nis separated from that of his neighbor by canals of greater width,\r\nand often by stakes having a few branches on the ends. These [pg435]\r\n/pignons/, which sway in the wind, are said to frighten away the\r\npredaceous ray which is apt to hover about the preserves. The parcs\r\nare finally thinned out by sending the oysters to other parcs to be\r\nfattened. There is a celebrated /parc d'élevage/ at Marennes. It is\r\na collection of artificial ponds, the floors of which are covered\r\nwith algæ, which harbor vast numbers of diatoms and other microscopic\r\norganisms on which the oysters feed. The green diatom (/Navicula\r\nostrearia/) gives to the oysters of Marennes the green color and\r\npeculiar flavor which is so much esteemed by the epicures of France.\r\nTo the American, however, the green oyster is not acceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ostrea^\r\n\r\n  ^O. virginica.^ A description of this species, our common oyster,\r\n  is hardly necessary. Every one has seen the rough, shaggy, unlovely\r\n  shell. The hinge is toothless, but has a wide depression for the\r\n  ligament. The animal, having stationary habits, has practically no\r\n  foot at all. There is but one large adductor muscle, around which\r\n  curve the gills, the latter being united to each other posteriorly.\r\n  The mantle margin is finely and doubly fringed. Although /Ostrea/\r\n  is a stationary mollusk, it has no byssus.\r\n\r\n  /O. virginica/ has been introduced at San Francisco, where it\r\n  lives well, but does not seem to multiply very rapidly. The native\r\n  species, ^O. lurida^, is about two inches long, dark in color, and\r\n  stained a purplish hue. It is not very delicately flavored.\r\n\r\n  ^O. frons.^ This species has a thinner shell than /O. virginica/,\r\n  with coarsely serrated margins. It occurs in beds in the\r\n  neighborhood of mangroves all along our South Atlantic shores. It\r\n  cannot compare with its Northern relative in flavor, but, like the\r\n  European ^Ostrea edulis^, it is sometimes \"not bad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~PECTINIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pecten^\r\n\r\nThe scallop-shells (/Pecten/) are objects too familiar to require\r\nany general description. The rounded valve, usually ornamented with\r\nradiating ribs, and the wing-like projections (called \"ears\"), from\r\neach side of the umbonal region, are never-failing characters. The\r\noutline of /Pecten/ has been considerably employed in conventional\r\ndesigns for mural decorations; indeed, the figure [pg436] of a\r\nwell-known Mediterranean pecten (/P. jacobius/), found commonly\r\nin Palestine, became an emblem of religious significance during\r\nthe middle ages. Returning crusaders fastened to their garments a\r\nspecimen of \"St. James's shell\" as an evidence of the fact that they\r\nhad been to the Holy Land, and the design of the shell came to be\r\nadopted upon many coats of arms and also in the insignia of various\r\norders of devout and adventurous knights of the middle ages.\r\n\r\nThe animal is of the highest type of monomyarian mollusks, that is,\r\nof bivalve mollusks with only a single adductor muscle. Unlike most\r\npelecypods, which have a very small foot, /Pecten/ rarely has a\r\nbyssus, and is neither a stationary nor a sluggish creature. It can\r\npropel itself through the water by spasmodically closing and opening\r\nits valves, in an eccentric, darting sort of flight, though most of\r\nthe time it rests quietly upon the bottom. The mantle is entirely\r\nopen and highly ornate about its margin, which is, furthermore, the\r\nseat of many eyes, capable, apparently, of no mean degree of vision.\r\nThe adductor muscle is very large and strong, and occupies a central\r\nposition, about which the gills circle; the latter are plainly\r\nfilamentous.\r\n\r\n  ^P. magellanicus.^ The largest of the east-coast species of\r\n  /Pecten/. It is a Northern species, and was long known by the\r\n  name of ^P. tenuiscostatus^--a name given to it on account of\r\n  its very numerous radiating striæ; but it was later discovered\r\n  that the North Atlantic form was in reality the same as the /P.\r\n  magellanicus/ of Patagonia. The latter being the older name and\r\n  entitled to priority, our shell became /P. magellanicus/, the\r\n  other name falling within its synonymy. The length and height of\r\n  this scallop are from five to five and a half inches. One valve\r\n  is more convex and slightly larger than the other, the smaller\r\n  being lighter in color. The valves gape considerably along their\r\n  upper margin below the hinge. The cartilage-pit is deep. North of\r\n  Cape Ann this large species is of common occurrence in moderately\r\n  deep water. The deeper bays and arms of the sea which everywhere\r\n  penetrate the Maine coast are its favorite resorts. A good way\r\n  to catch pectens is to lower a fishing-line at a spot where the\r\n  fishermen report \"scallop-ground,\" and drag it along over the\r\n  bottom. Sooner or later it will enter the open shell of some\r\n  pecten, which will instantly close its valves upon the string and\r\n  allow itself to be drawn out of the water. In Maine these large\r\n  scallops are eaten, but they have not found great favor in the city\r\n  markets. In color they vary from reddish through brown to ashen.\r\n\r\n  ^P. islandicus.^ A species not so large as the last, with more\r\n  prominently raised ribs (about fifty to one hundred in number),\r\n  which are [pg437] covered with a multitude of erect scales. The\r\n  ribs persist upon the interior of the shell. The \"ears\" are unequal\r\n  in size. The color is light orange to reddish-brown, with zones of\r\n  darker and richer color. One valve is flatter than the other and\r\n  more lightly colored. Greatest length about three inches; height\r\n  three and a half inches. This is a Northern shell, belonging to the\r\n  waters of Newfoundland, but its valves are frequently cast upon the\r\n  New England beaches.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Pecten islandicus./]\r\n\r\n  ^P. irradians.^ The common shallow-water species of the Atlantic\r\n  coast. This exceedingly abundant species does not range north of\r\n  Boston, but finds an extensive habitat to the south. Its metropolis\r\n  is Cape Cod, Long Island Sound, and the Jersey coast waters. This\r\n  is the true scallop of the Boston and New York markets. Only the\r\n  adductor muscle is eaten. In this species there is not so marked\r\n  a difference in the convexity of the two valves. There are about\r\n  twenty elevated and rounded ribs, the spaces between them being\r\n  also rounded. The color is variable, from a blackish horn to ashen\r\n  gray. The \"ears\" are equal; the interior is shining, and grooved\r\n  to correspond with the external ribs. Length two and three fifths\r\n  inches, height two and a half inches. On clear, calm days the\r\n  immature individuals of this species may often be seen in shallow\r\n  water disporting themselves most gaily, skipping about and snapping\r\n  their valves in great glee. Their mantle margins are very ornate\r\n  in scarlet or orange, with rows of bright-blue eyes. Care must be\r\n  taken in handling scallops, especially the large /P. magellanicus/,\r\n  for a finger caught between the valves will be badly bruised.\r\n\r\n  ^P. dislocatus.^ South of Hatteras this species takes the place of\r\n  its Northern relative, /P. irradians/. It is somewhat more globular\r\n  and perhaps not quite so large, but the resemblance between the two\r\n  species is very marked. It has from twenty to twenty-two rounded\r\n  ribs, with very numerous concentric wrinkles between them. In\r\n  color it is white, tinged with purple or yellow, with occasionally\r\n  a system of blood-red lines crossing the ribs transversely. The\r\n  diameter is about one and a half inches. This species has the\r\n  same playful habits as /P. irradians/, and is not at all easy to\r\n  capture. When pursued it dives into the mud, and sets up such a\r\n  commotion by the spasmodic opening and shutting of its valves that\r\n  the water at once becomes roiled, and the scallop is safely hidden\r\n  in its murky depths. [pg438]\r\n\r\n  ^P. hastatus.^ There are several very beautiful pectens on the\r\n  Pacific coast of the United States, and two of these--one of\r\n  northern and the other of southern range--resemble very closely\r\n  the two Atlantic species of relatively north and south range, /P.\r\n  islandicus/ and /P. irradians/ or /dislocatus/. The first is /P.\r\n  hastatus/ of Puget Sound. Valves of this exquisite shell are even\r\n  occasionally found in California. It has very much the aspect of\r\n  /P. islandicus/--unequal ears and an ovate form. The most curious\r\n  thing about this shell is the fact that a different system of\r\n  sculpturing exists upon the two valves. Upon one the ribs are even\r\n  and the whole surface is covered with raised scales; upon the other\r\n  the ribs are alternately of large and small size. Color rose-pink,\r\n  with deeper bands; one valve lighter-colored, suffused with\r\n  delicate pink. Height two and a half inches. (Plate LXXIX.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Pecten irradians/, typical form.]\r\n\r\n  ^P. æquisulcatus.^ The Southern species above referred to as\r\n  resembling /P. irradians/ or /dislocatus/. It has about twenty\r\n  stout, well-rounded ribs, with concentric wrinkles between\r\n  them. The \"ears\" are equal. The size and shape are as in /P.\r\n  irradians/. The coloring is whitish, varying to shades of brown,\r\n  and excentrically marked with spots or waving transverse lines of\r\n  chestnut or horn.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER =EULAMELLIBRANCHIATA=\r\n\r\nWith the pectens we leave behind all pelecypods with the true\r\nfilamentous type of gill. In the order /Eulamellibranchiata/ we find\r\nall the families to be possessed of the basketwork or crisscross\r\nbranchial structure. Each gill is fundamentally formed of filaments\r\nwhich project downward, and then suddenly turn upon themselves and\r\nascend; the ascending and descending limbs are connected, however, by\r\nprocesses of presumably vascular function, and adjacent filaments are\r\nconnected by truly vascular channels. The closer connection of the\r\nfilaments to form of each gill a sort of plate is further effected\r\n[pg439] by connective tissue, which sometimes is dense enough (though\r\nalways porous) to obscure the reticulated appearance of the organ.\r\nFurthermore, the edge of the outer lamella of the outer gill unites\r\nwith the mantle; likewise the edge of the inner lamella of the inner\r\ngill unites with the body-mass, and /behind the body-mass/ with the\r\ngills upon the other side of the animal. This union of the four gills\r\nin a straight median line behind the foot and body-mass forms a\r\nseptum, which divides off from the mantle cavity a \"suprabranchial\"\r\ncavity. Into this cavity the excreta are discharged, and with it the\r\nanal or excurrent siphon connects. The branchial or incurrent siphon\r\nthus pours its current of water into the /lower/ mantle cavity, to\r\nbathe the gills and feed the mouth, while the fresh water is not\r\ncontaminated by any open and wide connection with the excretory\r\nprocesses. In many of the forms where the siphons are very long and\r\nunited, this septum, formed by the union of the dorsal edges of the\r\ninner gills back of the foot, is continued far into the siphons,\r\nconstituting the division of the two into the anal and branchial\r\nsiphons.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of this order is the marked tendency to mantle\r\nfusion. As there are always siphons, the mantle-edges must\r\nnecessarily have fused at two points at least, in order to have\r\nformed the siphons. The tendency, however, is for the fusion to\r\ncontinue, narrowing the pedal opening more and more, as though the\r\nmantle were endeavoring to envelop the entire animal in a bag or sac\r\nopen only at one end (siphonal opening), but yet slightly ripped\r\nalong one seam (pedal opening).\r\n\r\nThis order includes the great majority of pelecypods, and admits of\r\nmany very confusing modifications in its most essential features.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CARDITIDÆ~\r\n\r\nIn this, the first family of the order, most of the characteristic\r\nfeatures just spoken of are present. Mantle fusion, however, has\r\nnot progressed beyond a degree which is just sufficient to form the\r\nsiphons. There is a byssiferous gland. The name /Carditidæ/ refers to\r\nthe heart-shape of the shells. [pg440]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cardita^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Cardita borealis/, natural size.]\r\n\r\n  ^C. borealis.^ A very common species north of Cape Ann, reported\r\n  also in deeper water as far south as Hatteras. It is a solid,\r\n  obliquely heart-shaped shell, with beaks elevated and turned\r\n  forward. It has about eighteen to twenty rounded radiating ribs,\r\n  which are broader than the grooves between them. The epidermis\r\n  is rusty-brown. The hinge is strong, with two prominent teeth;\r\n  the margins of the shell are strongly crenulated within.\r\n  Length one inch; height about the same. This is not strictly a\r\n  between-the-tides species, but its valves are often cast upon the\r\n  beaches. Fine specimens may be obtained by dredging at Bar Harbor\r\n  or Eastport.\r\n\r\n  ^C. floridana.^ A very common Floridian species. Its seventeen or\r\n  eighteen ribs are very heavy, and are rendered nodulous by the\r\n  numerous bluntly raised scales upon them. The shell is lengthened,\r\n  and has a well-defined lunule and an external ligament. In color\r\n  it is yellowish-white, with purple markings when young. Length one\r\n  inch; height three fourths of an inch. It lives in sheltered bays;\r\n  detached valves are often found cast upon the beach.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~ASTARTIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Astarte^\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their rather small size, there is a trimness about\r\nthe shells of /Astarte/ which, taken together with their rich\r\nchestnut epidermis, makes them very interesting and desirable\r\nadditions to the cabinet. The family is one of cold-water range, with\r\na few representatives on the New England coast. Live specimens are\r\nnot easily captured, for they live in deeper water than one would\r\ncare to wade in, nevertheless they are frequently cast upon the\r\nbeaches after storms. The animal has a very short efferent siphon,\r\nlarge labial palps, and very obliquely placed gills. Not more than\r\ntwenty living species of /Astarte/ are known, and all of them belong\r\nin, or are wanderers from, polar seas. Fully three hundred fossil\r\nspecies of this genus have been described from Mesozoic rocks in all\r\nparts of the world. The question naturally arises whether in these\r\nits dying days /Astarte/ has sought colder waters in which to pass\r\nits remaining existence, or whether climates have changed. The fact\r\nthat such strictly [pg441] tropical genera as /Voluta/ and /Conus/\r\nare found fossil in northern Siberia seems to be evidence in proof of\r\ngreat climatic variations.\r\n\r\n  ^A. castanea.^ This species has a thick and heavy shell for one\r\n  so small, with round ventral margins and prominent beaks. The\r\n  surface is very slightly undulated and is covered with a thick\r\n  chestnut epidermis with pale and dark zones. The hinge is broad and\r\n  flat, with a prominent cardinal tooth upon the right valve, which\r\n  accurately fits into a pit formed by two teeth on the left valve.\r\n  Length one inch; height one inch.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Astarte castanea./]\r\n\r\n  ^A. undata.^ A species slightly larger than the last, with ten to\r\n  twenty prominent concentric undulations.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Astarte undata./]\r\n\r\n  The identification of the many species of /Astarte/ often becomes\r\n  exceedingly difficult on account of the fact that the genus is a\r\n  remarkably uniform one in its main characters and is infinitely\r\n  variable in its minor details.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CYPRINIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Arctica^\r\n\r\nThis family is represented by one species upon the New England coast,\r\nwhich is much sought after by collectors. It is one of the larger\r\nclams, but is too uncommon to have received a popular name and to be\r\ngenerally well known by the fishermen along the shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Arctica/ (/Cyprina/) /islandica/.]\r\n\r\n  ^A.^ (^Cyprina^) ^islandica^. This clam has a thick though not\r\n  ponderous shell, with prominent beaks and a stout, prominent\r\n  ligament. Its cardinal teeth are large, but its laterals are very\r\n  small. A striking feature of this species, which at once separates\r\n  [pg442] it from all other shells of our coast of similar size,\r\n  is the coarse, wrinkled epidermis of black to chestnut color.\r\n  The shell is very suggestive of a large, overgrown /Astarte/.\r\n  Length three and a half inches; height three inches. It is found\r\n  of all sizes, down to one fourth of an inch in diameter, upon\r\n  muddy stations in moderately deep water near the mouths of rivers;\r\n  but the surest way to get it is to search the beach after a hard\r\n  onshore gale.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~LUCINIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThis family finds its metropolis in warmer waters, and the best\r\nrepresentatives of it must be sought for upon the Floridian beaches\r\nor in the shallow bays of that sandy coast. A long vermiform foot\r\nis a characteristic of the animal, as is also the fact that at\r\ntimes there is only a single gill upon each side of the body. In\r\nsome of the /Lucinidæ/, more so than in most other pelecypods, the\r\nchief function of the gills is to furnish a brooding-place for the\r\nthousands of ova which the creatures generate. Sometimes a /Lucina/\r\nwill be captured with the gills swollen out of all proportion,\r\nand literally stuffed with tiny, microscopic eggs. At such times\r\nthe gills lose all semblance of branchial organs. The shells are\r\norbicular, with depressed small umbones, a distinct lunule, a\r\nsemi-external ligament, two cardinal teeth, and laterals (a variable\r\nfeature). There is no pallial sinus. The color is white, and the\r\noutlines are rounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Lucina^\r\n\r\n  ^L. tigrina.^ The largest of the group, measuring three inches\r\n  across and nearly the same in height. It is flatly convex and\r\n  radially ribbed by a great number of costæ which are crossed and\r\n  decussated throughout with concentric ridges. The color is white.\r\n  This fine shell lives only in southern Florida and is abundant in\r\n  shallow water on sandy stations. (Plate LXXX.)\r\n\r\n  ^L. floridana.^ One of the most abundant bivalves in Florida, often\r\n  cast in thousands upon the beaches. It lives in shallow protected\r\n  waters and upon sand-flats which are partly exposed at low tide.\r\n  It has the usual round outlines of the genus, with exceedingly\r\n  small umbones, directed forward, and a smooth surface, save for\r\n  fine growth-lines of a light straw-color. The shell is pure white.\r\n  Diameter about one inch. (Plate LXXX.)\r\n\r\n  ^L. pennsylvanica.^ A species often associated with the last,\r\n  but about twice as large. Its thin but tough epidermis clings\r\n  to the shell in raised concentric lines, giving it a circularly\r\n  ribbed appearance. The most prominent feature of this species is\r\n  a depressed line upon either valve extending obliquely from the\r\n  umbones to the posterior ventral margin, [pg443] causing, at the\r\n  margin, a pucker or break in its even continuity. The lunule is\r\n  large and ribbed; the teeth are small; the color is pure white,\r\n  with a light straw-tinted epidermis. (Plate LXXX.)\r\n\r\n  ^L. dentata.^ In this species the shells are thin and white, with\r\n  well-marked concentric lines crossed by deep oblique narrow furrows\r\n  bent at nearly right angles to the lines of growth and forming\r\n  teeth around the margin. Found along the entire coast.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Lucina dentata./]\r\n\r\n  ^L. californica.^ The best-known California species of this genus.\r\n  It is pure white, with fine concentric lines, and varies in size\r\n  from one half of an inch to one and a half inches in diameter. The\r\n  lateral teeth are the stronger, and the lunule is upon the right\r\n  valve only. With these exceptions this species preserves the usual\r\n  characters of this genus.\r\n\r\n  ^L. nuttallii^, belonging to the southern shores of California, is\r\n  decussated like fine wickerwork. The shell is flattened and ridged\r\n  along the hinge-margin. The color is white. Diameter about one inch\r\n  in large specimens. (Plate LXXX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Loripes^\r\n\r\n  ^L. edentula.^ A species which is seldom captured alive. Its\r\n  home is in the open sea, but vast quantities of its valves are\r\n  occasionally thrown upon the beaches south of Hatteras, as far as\r\n  the Gulf of Mexico. On account of the weak hinge ligament, the\r\n  valves become easily separated, and it is not always easy to find\r\n  two that will exactly match. /Loripes/ preserves the same circular\r\n  outlines as /Lucina/, but is more ventricose, and the hinge and\r\n  teeth are very feeble. This species is a little over two inches in\r\n  length and slightly under two inches in height. It is pure white\r\n  without, and is finely striated with growth-lines; bright orange\r\n  within, especially about the pallial line and muscle-scars. (Plate\r\n  LXXX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~TELLINIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Tellina^\r\n\r\nIf we should create an aristocracy of beauty among the bivalves, as\r\nhas been done by conchologists among the gasteropods, this family\r\nwould deserve high rank. Most of the American species of /Tellina/\r\nare too small to impress one very greatly with their beauty, but\r\nin the West Indies and in the tropical Pacific waters are some\r\nwonderfully handsome shells belonging to this or to the allied genus\r\n/Macoma/. However, we have in Florida the very striking /T. radiata/,\r\na truly beautiful shell, which, were it less common, would be highly\r\nprized in collections. Rarity, no doubt, adds a wonderful luster\r\nto shells as well as to gems. The [pg444] animal of /Tellina/ has\r\nlong, slender siphons, which are separate. The gills are small, and\r\nthe outer lamella or branchial fold is directed dorsally. Although\r\nthe foot shows evidences of a byssogenous gland, there is no actual\r\nbyssus. The shells are porcelanous and translucent, equivalve, with\r\nan external ligament, and at least two cardinal teeth in each valve.\r\n\r\n  ^T. radiata.^ This species varies from three to four inches in\r\n  length, and from one and a half to one and three fourths inches\r\n  in height. It is highly polished, shining white, and yellowish\r\n  about the umbonal region, and has three wide rays of bright pink\r\n  extending from the beaks to the ventral margin. On account of its\r\n  remarkable coloration it is called the \"setting-sun shell.\" Its\r\n  surface is smooth. A common variety is of a uniform creamy-white\r\n  color with carnation beaks. This shell is always offered for sale\r\n  by the marine curio- and shell-dealers in Florida seaside resorts,\r\n  and at Atlantic City, Cape May, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  ^T. alternata^ resembles the last in shape, being flattish and\r\n  oblong, but it is more pointed or angulated posteriorly. There is\r\n  also a slight twist in the posterior end of the shell. Its surface\r\n  is decorated by numerous impressed concentric lines. The color is\r\n  uniformly white or yellowish, with pink rays. Length two and a half\r\n  to three inches; height two and a half inches. Found from Hatteras\r\n  to the Gulf of Mexico, in shallow, sandy stations and on beaches\r\n  after storms. (Plate LXXXI.)\r\n\r\n  ^T. bodegensis.^ The most striking species of /Tellina/ found on\r\n  the west coast, and of rather northern range. It is about two\r\n  inches in length, creamy-white in color, and ornamented with very\r\n  fine concentric lines. A very characteristic feature of the genus\r\n  is present in this species as in the last, namely, a slight twist\r\n  or bend to one side in the posterior end of the shell.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Tellina tenera/, showing extended animal.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Tellina tenera./]\r\n\r\n  ^T. tenera.^ A little /Tellina/ found in New England waters, which,\r\n  though very small, is worthy of mention on account of its abundance\r\n  upon all our beaches north of Hatteras. It is only about half an\r\n  inch long, and slightly over one quarter of an inch high. It may\r\n  be distinguished by its general generic characters, its iridescent\r\n  surface, and its delicately marked lines of growth; sometimes\r\n  it is rose-tinted. Its remarkably long siphons are shown in the\r\n  accompanying figure.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Macoma^\r\n\r\n  ^M. secta.^ A very pretty thin glossy shell from two to three\r\n  inches in length and about one fourth less in height, which\r\n  occurs from Monterey southward. The posterior end of the shell is\r\n  contracted and slightly bent; the pallial sinus is deep. There is\r\n  an external ligament. (Plate LXXXI.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE LXXX. 1, Lucina tigrina. 3, Lucina\r\n  pennsylvanica. 2, Lucina floridana. 4, Lucina nuttallii. 5, Loripes\r\n  edentula.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE LXXXI. 1, Tellina alternata. 3, Donax\r\n  variabilis. 2, Macoma secta. 4, Donax californicus. 5, Ræta\r\n  canaliculata.]\r\n\r\n  ^M. nasuta.^ Another Californian species, with a less shining\r\n  surface and a very thin light-brownish epidermis. The twisting of\r\n  the posterior [pg445] margin is striking. It has very fine\r\n  cardinal teeth. Length two to three inches.\r\n\r\n  ^M. baltica^, ^M. proximo^, ^M. tenta^. The first two of these\r\n  species are dingy in color, and are covered with a dirty-looking,\r\n  thin epidermis. The first has a wide range to Norway and Scotland,\r\n  and is exceedingly common all along our coast from Maine to\r\n  Georgia. It occurs plentifully in the Hudson River above New York,\r\n  and in all sandy or muddy bays. It is rounded in outline, while the\r\n  next species (/M. proxima/) is more pointed posteriorly. When these\r\n  species are buried in the sand their two long, slender siphons\r\n  project above, one supplying the animal with a constant current\r\n  of fresh water, and the other ejecting that which, having passed\r\n  the gills and labial palps, is exhausted of its air and nutriment\r\n  and contaminated by waste products. /M. tenta/ is white, with very\r\n  fine lines of growth, and polished and shining within. It is warped\r\n  posteriorly. Length three fifths of an inch; height two fifths of\r\n  an inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Macoma baltica./]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Macoma tenta./]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~DONACIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Donax^\r\n\r\nThe /Donacidæ/ are represented upon our coasts by comparatively\r\nfew species, all belonging to the genus /Donax/. The shells are\r\nunder an inch in length, and have a peculiarly shortened anterior\r\nportion; thus they are inequilateral. Their ventral margins are\r\nfinely denticulate. The pallial sinus is deep. There are two or three\r\ncardinal teeth and a variable number of laterals.\r\n\r\n  ^D. variabilis.^ This little shell, the common Floridian form,\r\n  exhibits every imaginable scheme of color-combination, and defies\r\n  general or comprehensive description. Probably the most usual\r\n  pattern developed is a bluish-white background with purplish\r\n  radiating lines. Another is a pure-white foundation with red\r\n  lines. The surface is striated longitudinally with excessively\r\n  fine riblets. Length one half of an inch or slightly more. In\r\n  March and April these shells are thrown alive in millions upon the\r\n  Florida beaches. Each wave seems to be laden with them, and when\r\n  the foaming waters of each spent breaker recede, the little shells\r\n  lie still upon the sand for a moment, glittering like jewels in the\r\n  sunlight; then, with a sudden protrusion of the foot and a quick\r\n  turn, they all disappear like a flash, buried in the sand before\r\n  the next breaker strikes them. One must be very quick to catch\r\n  these active little mollusks. (Plate LXXXI.)\r\n\r\n  ^D. californicus.^ Professor Keep very aptly describes this shell,\r\n  which is very common in California, as \"short and stumpy, cut\r\n  nearly square off at one end (anterior), and tapering to a rounded\r\n  edge at the other.\" The same description fits both this and the\r\n  Floridian /D. variabilis/ so well that the two forms may be one\r\n  and the same species. [pg446] If they were shells of arctic\r\n  range it would be easier to connect them; but as neither is a\r\n  cold-water form, it becomes more difficult to place them under one\r\n  name. The increasing number of similar species being found upon\r\n  the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America points almost\r\n  conclusively to the existence of a waterway between the two oceans,\r\n  somewhere between North and South America, at no very remote\r\n  geological period. Possibly the closing of some such waterway\r\n  through the isthmus connecting the oceans has separated these forms\r\n  geographically, thus leading us to separate them specifically.\r\n  (Plate LXXXI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~MACTRIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThis is a very large family of universal distribution and with a\r\ngreat number of genera and subgenera, rather confusedly gathered\r\ninto subfamilies. The dominant genus /Mactra/ comprises the largest\r\nbivalve upon the east coast of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Mactra^\r\n\r\nThe mactras live in the sand near the margin of the water, often\r\nupon the exposed open coast. The mantle is open, except where it is\r\nfused to form the siphons. These are short and united. The outer gill\r\nis dorsally directed; that is to say, it does not depend into the\r\nmantle cavity as does the inner gill, but projects just the other\r\nway; it is also smaller than the inner one. The foot is strong,\r\nbent, and tongue-shaped, and no doubt well adapted to the rough life\r\nin the surf and the heavy, shifting sands. The main characteristic\r\nof the mactra shell is the prominent triangular-shaped fossette,\r\nor cartilage plate, situated internally and just under the beaks.\r\nThe shells are equivalve, and devoid of bright colors or striking\r\nsculptural features. Internally the pallial line is plain, and the\r\nsinus well marked but not deep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Mactra solidissima./]\r\n\r\n  ^M. solidissima^ is one of the very commonest, if not the\r\n  commonest large bivalve of the New England, Long Island, and New\r\n  Jersey [pg447] beaches. It is covered with a thin brownish or\r\n  straw-colored epidermis, usually more or less worn away in adult\r\n  specimens and wholly absent from the dead valves found upon the\r\n  beaches. There is a fragile V-shaped cardinal tooth, which is\r\n  generally broken away in forcing open the valves; the lateral teeth\r\n  are long and thin, and striated on their receiving surfaces. The\r\n  length of this \"giant clam\" is from four to seven inches. This is\r\n  the first shell the collector will find (north of Hatteras) when he\r\n  goes to an open, sandy beach.\r\n\r\n  ^M. similis.^ A small variety of the species last described, of\r\n  similar outline, but less heavy and strong. Its range is from\r\n  Hatteras southward to Brazil. Passing from New Jersey to Hatteras,\r\n  /Mactra solidissima/ diminishes in size, and after passing that\r\n  faunal barrier the Northern form is entirely replaced by this\r\n  Southern variety. The shell is brighter, though not exactly\r\n  bright-shining. Its habits are entirely similar to those of the\r\n  Northern form. On the west coast of Florida it is the most abundant\r\n  bivalve upon the beaches.\r\n\r\n  ^M. ovalis.^ A species of Northern range, which so greatly\r\n  resembles /M. solidissima/ as to suggest identity; but the lateral\r\n  teeth are smooth and not striated, while the shell itself seldom\r\n  attains a length of over four inches.\r\n\r\n  ^M. lateralis.^ An exceedingly common shell, found in all the\r\n  salt-marshes and tidal estuaries of our coast. It is much smaller\r\n  than the mactras just described, being not over one half of an\r\n  inch in length. It is white, and is covered with a dirty brown\r\n  epidermis; the hinge is strong, with deep cartilage fossette and\r\n  a V-shaped marginal tooth. The laterals are long and slender. The\r\n  animal has a strong foot and two slender, long siphons which are\r\n  yellow in color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Mactra lateralis./]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ræta^\r\n\r\n  ^R. (Labiosa) canaliculata.^ In this species the cartilage fossette\r\n  is the same as in /Mactra/; the marginal teeth are feeble, and\r\n  there are no laterals. The shells of /Mactra/ which we have\r\n  examined are heavy or at least solid, but /Ræta/ is thin and\r\n  fragile; it is pure white in color and is gracefully ornamented by\r\n  concentric raised ribs. The shell is inflated and gapes slightly\r\n  posteriorly; it is shining white within and is deeply grooved\r\n  concentrically in accordance with the external ribs. Length two\r\n  and a half, height two inches. From Hatteras to Mexico, this is\r\n  one of the commoner beach shells, but since, as in some other\r\n  species already named, the hinge ligament and teeth are feeble, the\r\n  valves become separated by the buffeting of the waves, and are cast\r\n  disjointed and singly upon the beaches. (Plate LXXXI.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~VENERIDÆ~\r\n\r\nIn many respects this is the most distinguished pelecypod family.\r\nIt is the largest in number of genera and species, is of world-wide\r\ndistribution, and supplies to hungry man a number [pg448] of\r\ncomestible species. Several of its genera have been named after\r\nvarious goddesses and nymphs on account of the great beauty of\r\ntheir shells. But from a purely biological point of view also the\r\n/Veneridæ/ have claims to distinction, for they seem to represent\r\nabout the highest type of shell-development among the bivalves. The\r\ntest is extremely hard and often porcelanous. It is solid without\r\nbeing ponderous and unwieldy in the sense of causing the animal to\r\nbe helplessly overburdened by the sheer weight of its shell. The\r\nvalves are equal and have three stout cardinal teeth. The foot is\r\nstrong, the animal is active, the siphons are free or partially\r\nunited, and the gills are more or less crumpled and folded. There is\r\na compactness and well-regulated arrangement of the organs in the\r\n/Veneridæ/, which impress one who has examined the anatomy of many\r\npelecypods much as a well-built, efficient, and space-economizing\r\nmachine would impress a mechanic. None of the organs are weak or\r\ncrowded out to furnish room for the undue or awkward development\r\nof other organs. A good balance is preserved between them all, the\r\nresult being a high type of pelecypod.\r\n\r\nIf we do not expect to find any of the more remarkable forms of the\r\n/Veneridæ/ upon our shores we shall be the less disappointed when\r\nreturning from collecting-expeditions. Nevertheless, there are a few\r\nspecies of /Cytherea/, /Dosinia/, and /Tivela/ in North American\r\nwaters which are very handsome shells; but those of our species which\r\nare included under the generic name /Venus/ are in point of beauty\r\nnot worthy of their promising name.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Venus^\r\n\r\n  ^V. mercenaria.^ This is the common \"hard-shell clam,\" the \"Little\r\n  Neck\" of the hotels and restaurants, with which every one in New\r\n  York and New England is familiar. The species ranges from Cape\r\n  Cod to Florida, and occupies two different kinds of station: one\r\n  in shallow muddy bays near low-tide mark, in estuaries, etc.; the\r\n  other the sandy stations in open deeper bays or the open ocean.\r\n  Those coming from \"outside\" have thinner, more delicate shells,\r\n  with thin, concentric ribs. They burrow in the sand or mud, or\r\n  crawl quite rapidly. The siphons are short and are united almost\r\n  to their ends. The mantle is open (save for the siphons), and the\r\n  edges are delicately frilled. In the United States this species\r\n  is very extensively gathered for the markets. When the oyster\r\n  season closes in April, the hard-shell clam comes into vogue, the\r\n  season lasting until September or October. The clams are [pg449]\r\n  extensively gathered in the estuaries from Cape May to Cape Cod.\r\n  Men armed with rakes drift about in small boats and fish the\r\n  sluggish creatures up out of the mud. They will live for many days\r\n  out of water if kept in a cool place. Smaller or immature clams are\r\n  better for the table, since they are not so tough as their elders.\r\n  A few features of the shell of this species are noticeable--the\r\n  rather prominent umbones directed forward, the heart-shaped lunule,\r\n  the external ligament, the concentric sculpturing of growth-lines,\r\n  the pure-white interior (with occasionally violet zones about\r\n  the muscle-scars and margin), the three stout cardinal teeth,\r\n  the sharp-angled pallial sinus, and the ventral margin finely\r\n  crenulated within. The greatest length is about three inches and\r\n  the height two and a half inches, but these dimensions exceed those\r\n  of the clams usually served upon the half-shell. /V. mercenaria/\r\n  ranges into Florida, increasing in size and bulk as it meets the\r\n  warmer waters of the Gulf Stream. The Floridian form has received\r\n  the varietal name of /mortoni/. This massive clam sometimes weighs\r\n  five pounds, and is fully six inches in diameter. Aside from its\r\n  great size and thickness, the characters of the shell are wholly\r\n  those of the smaller Northern form. It is abundant in shallow,\r\n  muddy, brackish bays, and is gathered by men who \"tread out\" the\r\n  clams, feeling for them in the mud and sand with bare feet. The\r\n  flesh is tough and disagreeably strong, yet the natives appear to\r\n  relish it, especially when it is made into a chowder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Venus mercenaria/, typical form.]\r\n\r\n  ^V. cancellata.^ The most abundant species of /Venus/ in Florida,\r\n  particularly near Tampa and on the west side. It preserves all the\r\n  characteristics of the genus, and is decorated with a series of\r\n  high, narrow, concentric ridges, between which are much smaller and\r\n  more numerous radiating riblets. The color is dirty white to light\r\n  yellow-brown without, and white and violet within. There are three\r\n  cardinal teeth and no laterals. The lunule is heart-shaped; the\r\n  posterior margin is broadened into a wide, concave area into which\r\n  the concentric ridges do not pass. Length one to one and a fourth\r\n  inches; height the same. Sometimes the beaches in Florida will in\r\n  places be banked up with the valves of this very abundant /Venus/.\r\n  As they live in shallow water upon sandy stations, they are easily\r\n  dislodged by the heavy storms which sometimes sweep that usually\r\n  placid coast. (Plate LXXXII.) [pg450]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cytherea^\r\n\r\n  ^C. (Callista) gigantea.^ One of the most beautiful Floridian\r\n  shells. It is nearly or quite six inches long and about three and\r\n  a fourth inches in height. The shell is porcelanous, is covered\r\n  with a pinkish, livid epidermis, and is decorated with numerous\r\n  longitudinal color-rays of lilac. The rays are usually broken and\r\n  interrupted. Within it is china-white, and has a deep pallial\r\n  sinus. It is very abundant on the west coast of Florida, at Sanibel\r\n  Island, Egmont Key, Lake Worth, and on beaches. (Plate LXXXII.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. maculata.^ This species is more oval in outline than the last.\r\n  It is of a fawn-color, blotched or waved with violet-brown, and\r\n  is porcelanous and shining. The epidermis is also shining and\r\n  corneous. Within it is china-white in color. The pallial sinus is\r\n  very deep and wide. Length two and a half to three inches; height\r\n  one and a half to two inches. This also is a shell to be looked for\r\n  upon the beach after storms, but it will probably not be seen on\r\n  the east coast of Florida, although it occurs on the Keys and also\r\n  at Hatteras. Both of the species have been used as food, but not\r\n  very extensively. The flesh is not lacking in tenderness, but it\r\n  has a peppery taste. (Plate LXXXII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Dosinia^\r\n\r\n  There are two species of this very graceful genus of /Veneridæ/\r\n  south of Hatteras, ^D. discus^ and ^D. elegans^. These dosinias\r\n  have united siphons. The foot is very large and strong, and the\r\n  mantle margin is both papillaceous and plicated. The shells of\r\n  these two species are about three or three and a half inches in\r\n  length and of the same height, and are very flat. The ventral\r\n  margin is almost a perfect circle, and the beaks are small and\r\n  pointed. The lunule is small and cordate; the valves are very\r\n  gracefully sculptured in fine, regular, impressed, concentric\r\n  striæ, which are finer and less elevated in /D. discus/ than in\r\n  /D. elegans/; the shell is porcelanous and white, and is covered\r\n  by a straw-colored, very fine, transparent epidermis. Within, the\r\n  strong cardinal teeth are placed upon a long fossette. There is a\r\n  deep pallial sinus. /D. discus/ is characteristic of the east coast\r\n  of Florida, while /D. elegans/ is only found upon the west side of\r\n  the State. Both may be looked for upon the beach, though living\r\n  specimens must be captured with the dredge. (Plate LXXXII.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXXXII. Venus cancellata. /Cytherea/\r\n(/Callista/) /maculata/. /Cytherea/ (/Callista/) /gigantea/. Dosinia\r\ndiscus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Tivela^\r\n\r\nThe coast of California is also favored by the /Veneridæ/, a number\r\nof large species belonging to several genera being present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE LXXXIII. Tivela crassatelloides, one half\r\nnatural size. Chione succincta. Tapes laciniata, one half natural\r\nsize. Chione simillima.]\r\n\r\n  ^T. crassatelloides.^ Perhaps the largest and finest of the\r\n  California species. It is so common in its between-tides station\r\n  that it used to be collected by plowing a furrow through the\r\n  sand, the big shells being thrown out upon either side like\r\n  potatoes. The shells attain a length of five and a half inches,\r\n  and are porcelanous, thick, and heavy. The margins of the valves\r\n  are also thick and rounded. The exterior is perfectly smooth,\r\n  yellowish-white in color, and decorated [pg451] with purplish\r\n  rays arranged in various groupings; over all is a glossy epidermis.\r\n  The hinge-teeth are very strong, and a prominent anterior lateral\r\n  tooth on the left valve is noticeable. There is an external\r\n  ligament; the pallial sinus is well marked, but not very deep.\r\n  (Plate LXXXIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Chione^\r\n\r\nThere are three species on the west coast. This genus is very closely\r\nallied to /Venus/, and is considered by many to be only a subgenus of\r\nthe latter. All three species are white, solid, heavy shells which\r\nexhibit the same scheme of sculpturing, namely, numerous longitudinal\r\nribs crossed by larger and less frequent concentric ridges.\r\n\r\n  ^C. simillima^ is shaped almost exactly like the east-coast /Venus\r\n  cancellata/, but its concentric ridges are very numerous and sharp.\r\n  There is a strongly marked cordate lunule, and hardly any pallial\r\n  sinus. Length one and a half to two inches. (Plate LXXXIII.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. succincta^ has fewer concentric ridges and has a large lunule.\r\n  There are purple zones within and touching the heavy cardinal\r\n  teeth. Length two and a half inches. (Plate LXXXIII.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. fluctifraga^ has broad but flatter or well-rounded (not sharp)\r\n  concentric ridges, no lunule, a small ligament, a fairly deep\r\n  pallial sinus, and a finely crenulated margin (within) all around\r\n  the valves, except when interrupted by the hinge ligament. The\r\n  shell is solid and shining, and marked by deep-purple zones within.\r\n  Length one to two inches. Found in southern California.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Tapes^\r\n\r\nThis is a prominent genus of the /Veneridæ/. Its chief feature is\r\nthe total want of lateral teeth. There are several large species in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n  ^T. staminea, T. laciniata.^ These are the most noticeable\r\n  species. The former is sold in the San Francisco markets as the\r\n  \"hard-shell clam.\" The shell of this species is from two to three\r\n  inches in length and of somewhat less height, rounded, and heavy.\r\n  The sculpturing consists of radiating ribs traversed by strongly\r\n  marked growth-lines. The teeth are strong, and the pallial sinus\r\n  is deep. /T. laciniata/ is much like the last, but its surface is\r\n  reticulated by a crisscross design that is very striking. It also\r\n  has a deep pallial sinus. These two species are of Southern range.\r\n  They burrow in gravelly places, among stones, between tide-marks,\r\n  and their presence may frequently be detected when walking along\r\n  the beach at low tide by seeing a sudden jet of water ejected from\r\n  a little hole in the mud or gravel. The animal, becoming alarmed at\r\n  the approach of something, suddenly snaps shut its valves, and thus\r\n  forces out some water through its siphons. The foot is very strong\r\n  and often byssiferous in this genus. (Plate LXXXIII.) [pg452]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Saxidomus^\r\n\r\n  ^S. nuttallii.^ The last of the larger west-coast /Veneridæ/ which\r\n  we shall examine. The genus is very closely allied to /Tapes/, and\r\n  no doubt might better be considered as its subgenus. The shell is\r\n  brownish-white, three to four inches in length, and heavy, rough,\r\n  and coarse-looking, with irregular concentric ridges. There is\r\n  no lunule, but a large external ligament is very prominent just\r\n  back of the beaks. Within it is white, with a deep pallial sinus.\r\n  Just below the ligament area is a zone of translucent, agate-like\r\n  shell-structure. This large clam, with several others of the same\r\n  genus, lives in shallow water near shore.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~PETRICOLIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Petricola^\r\n\r\n  ^P. pholadiformis.^ Along the Jersey coast, especially about\r\n  Atlantic City, there are small patches of clay or hard tenacious\r\n  mud which lie just at the edge of the sea. As the beating of\r\n  the surf gradually encroaches upon these hard fragments of once\r\n  extensive clay-beds, many specimens of this curious bivalve mollusk\r\n  are washed out from their burrows in this clay and cast upon the\r\n  sandy beach. The animal has long siphons which are united about\r\n  one third of the way to their ends. Although this creature is\r\n  allied to the /Veneridæ/, the degree of mantle fusion present is\r\n  much greater, leaving in this case only a fairly long slit through\r\n  which the foot may protrude. The shell is very dissimilar to that\r\n  of any of the /Veneridæ/, and in many respects, judging from a\r\n  conventional standard, is a remarkable form. It is exceedingly\r\n  thin, is of a chalky texture, gapes widely posteriorly, and is\r\n  ornamented with transverse ribs, which are feeble upon the long\r\n  produced posterior portion of the shell, but strong in the anterior\r\n  part, where they are crossed by the coarse lines of growth, which\r\n  appear like vaulted scales upon the ribs. The color is a dull\r\n  white. There are two cardinals in each valve and no laterals.\r\n  Length one and a quarter to two and a half inches; height one half\r\n  to three quarters of an inch. This species passes its entire life\r\n  in the burrow it has made for itself in the clay. Its only motions\r\n  are made in climbing to the entrance of its burrow or in retreating\r\n  far out of sight within its depths. Its siphons are tipped with a\r\n  dark or drab color as a measure of protection from the predaceous\r\n  crabs which range about the mud surfaces near tidal marks, and are\r\n  always upon the lookout for succulent bits of flesh.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Petricola pholadiformis./]\r\n\r\n  ^P. carditoides.^ A petricola of the Californian coast, very\r\n  similar in its habits to the east-coast form. It bores, however,\r\n  not only into clay, but also into soft rocks in order to effect a\r\n  permanent lodgment. Often this species occupies a hole which it has\r\n  discovered already existing; in this case its shell grows to fit\r\n  the surroundings. The hinge-teeth, and sculpturing are frequently\r\n  reduced and sometimes are quite obsolete; but the shell has the\r\n  chalky, thin texture that is characteristic of the genus. [pg453]\r\n\r\n  There is another family of rock- and mud-boring bivalves which\r\n  superficially resemble the petricolas, but their anatomical\r\n  organization removes them to a little distance from the\r\n  /Petricolidæ/. They are considered further on, under the name of\r\n  /Pholadidæ/.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~CARDIIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Cardium^\r\n\r\nThis is another important family of the /Pelecypoda/, which, with\r\nthe /Veneridæ/, the /Mactridæ/, and the /Tellinidæ/, is entitled to\r\ndistinction on account of its high organization, its high type of\r\nshell, its universal geographical distribution, and its great beauty.\r\nThe dominant genus is /Cardium/--a name given on account of the fact\r\nthat the shell is shaped like a heart. The animal has a very long,\r\nrecurved, and surprisingly strong foot. The mantle-edges are quite\r\nfreely open to the siphonal region and are highly papillate and\r\nwaved. The siphons are usually very short, but have wide exterior\r\nopenings and are also strongly papillate about their margins. The\r\ngills are obliquely situated, and seem to be thicker and heavier\r\nthan is usual in pelecypods; they are much folded, the outer lamella\r\nbeing the smaller. With such a pointed foot and such short siphons\r\n/Cardium/ is obviously not a deep-burrowing genus; but it does\r\npartially bury itself in soft semi-liquid sand. Its progression is\r\neffected by leaps which it is enabled to make by reaching far out\r\nwith its foot, then suddenly twisting to one side and throwing the\r\nshell several inches. The shell is ventricose, is closed or gapes\r\nslightly posteriorly, and has prominent subcentral umbones and an\r\nexternal ligament. The sculpture-scheme of /Cardium/ (if the shell\r\nis not perfectly smooth) is one of radiating ribs or ridges, which,\r\nbeing regular, form a perfect crenulation of the ventral margin.\r\nThere are two cardinal teeth in the center, and one lateral tooth\r\nupon both the anterior and the posterior side: the latter are\r\nsituated at some little distance from the beaks.\r\n\r\n  ^C. magnum.^ The largest and finest \"cockle\" of the east coast of\r\n  the United States. It is, indeed, one of the finest cockles in the\r\n  world. The almost perfect heart-shape is striking. The posterior\r\n  side is somewhat flatly depressed. The thirty-three to thirty-seven\r\n  regularly disposed, broad, radiating ribs; the regularly crenulated\r\n  margins; the yellowish-brown color garnished with transverse rows\r\n  of chestnut or [pg454] purple lines or spots; the brownish-purple\r\n  posterior area--all combine to make this large /Cardium/ a\r\n  beautiful species. Its length is four inches; height five and a\r\n  quarter inches. It is a very abundant species on the open Florida\r\n  beaches, where it is often left exposed and alive at very low\r\n  tides. (Plate LXXXIV.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. isocardia.^ This also is a Floridian species, of elongated\r\n  heart-shape and with radiating ribs. It is not more than half\r\n  as large as the last-described species. The ribs are decorated\r\n  with erect vaulting scales which are exaggerated portions\r\n  of growth-lines. The beaks are smaller in proportion than\r\n  in /C. magnum/. The shell is brown to straw-color, stained\r\n  with purplish-brown without, and has a bright salmon-red or\r\n  purplish-pink interior. The margins are deeply crenulated. The\r\n  teeth are arranged as in the last-described species. It is very\r\n  common on the beaches of western Florida. (Plate LXXXIV.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. serratum^, ^C. lævigatum^. These two species have a perfectly\r\n  smooth surface, and inflated, globose, heart-shaped shells, and\r\n  are of a creamy-white color, suffused with a yellowish, golden\r\n  tint which suggests the color of butter. Some forms are shiny, and\r\n  citron-yellow and pinkish toward the margins, whence the name of\r\n  \"peach-shell.\" Height one to two inches. Not uncommon upon Florida\r\n  beaches. (Plate LXXXIV.)\r\n\r\n  ^C. mortoni.^ Another of the smooth forms of /Cardium/ (placed in\r\n  the subgenus /Lævicardium/). It occurs in Florida and also extends\r\n  up the coast to Cape Cod, being very abundant in Long Island Sound.\r\n  In the neighborhood of Martha's Vineyard and along the north shore\r\n  of Long Island this very pretty little species has been reported as\r\n  occurring in soft ground even above low-tide mark, near the mouths\r\n  of creeks. It is enough to say of it that it is a smaller edition\r\n  of /C. lævigatum/ and may be further distinguished by a purple\r\n  blotch on the posterior margin, just within the valves, the general\r\n  color within being bright yellow. In young specimens, zigzag lines\r\n  of dark fawn-color upon the pale-yellowish background of the smooth\r\n  exterior surface of the shells are a noticeable feature. The\r\n  largest specimens measure an inch in length and nearly the same in\r\n  height. The long cirri upon the siphons are striking.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Cardium mortoni/, showing extended animal.]\r\n\r\n  ^C. substriatum.^ A cockle of this inflated, smooth type, which\r\n  strongly resembles the east-coast form, found upon the Pacific\r\n  coast. The name indicates that it is not altogether smooth, a\r\n  fact only revealed, however, by a magnifying-glass. It is about\r\n  one half of an inch in length, and of a light drab-color, spotted\r\n  and sometimes radially lined with yellowish-brown. Professor Keep\r\n  likens this species in both shape and color to a sparrow's egg.\r\n  (Plate LXXXIV.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE LXXXIV. 1, Cardium magnum, much reduced. 2,\r\n  Cardium isocardia. 3, Cardium lævigatum. 4, Cardium substriatum,\r\n  enlarged. 5, Cardium corbis (young specimen). 6, Glycimeris\r\n  generosa.]\r\n\r\n  ^C. elatum.^ A veritable giant among the cardiums. It is found on\r\n  the southern Californian coast, though rarely north of the Mexican\r\n  border. It is of the smooth, glossy type belonging to the subgenus\r\n  /Lævicardium/. It attains a diameter of six inches, and is of a\r\n  creamy-yellow appearance.\r\n\r\n  ^C. corbis^, ^C. quadrigenarium^. These two Californian cockles\r\n  are of the ribbed type displayed in the eastern /C. magnum/ and\r\n  /C. isocardia/. /C. corbis/ is found in the northern Californian\r\n  and Puget Sound region, [pg455] and /C. quadrigenarium/ on\r\n  the southern shores of California. The former is a full, round,\r\n  heart-shaped shell with about thirty somewhat scaly ribs. The edge\r\n  of the shell is deeply toothed; the color light brownish; the\r\n  diameter from two to three inches. It preserves all the features\r\n  of the genus as regards both shell and anatomical characters. The\r\n  other species, /C. quadrigenarium/, very strongly resembles /C.\r\n  magnum/ in size and shape. It lacks the flattened area on the\r\n  posterior portion of the shell which is characteristic of the\r\n  east-coast species, and its uniform brownish-white coloration is\r\n  less striking. It has about forty regularly spaced, radiating ribs,\r\n  which are smooth upon the umbonal region, but elsewhere are armed\r\n  with spiny processes. Diameter about six inches. (Plate LXXXIV.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Cardium islandicum./]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Cardium pinnulatum./]\r\n\r\n  ^C. islandicum^, ^C. pinnulatum^. Both of these are cold-water\r\n  species and occur along the New England coast. The former has\r\n  a shell which varies from one half of an inch to two inches in\r\n  length, and has from thirty-six to thirty-eight sharp, three-sided,\r\n  radiating ribs, the furrows between them being rounded and wrinkled\r\n  by growth-lines. A yellowish-brown epidermis covers the shell and\r\n  bristles into a sort of fringe upon the sharp edges of the ribs.\r\n  /C. islandicum/ cannot be said to be a very common species in New\r\n  England, although collectors have so reported it. Specimens from\r\n  Massachusetts are not as large as those of more northern habitat.\r\n  It does not occur south of Cape Cod. /C. pinnulatum/ is one of the\r\n  \"small fry\" among the cockles. Its largest diameter is less than\r\n  one half of an inch; but what it lacks in size it seems to endeavor\r\n  to make up in abundance, for it is scattered everywhere along the\r\n  coast from New York northward. Specimens can nearly always be found\r\n  in the stomachs of fishes, which, by the way, form an excellent\r\n  hunting-ground for rare species of mollusks of small size. There\r\n  are twenty-six slightly rounded ribs, with deep linear grooves\r\n  between them. Upon the ribs, especially in the posterior portion\r\n  of the shell, are arched scales, folded so as to appear like blunt\r\n  spines. The species may easily be distinguished from the young of\r\n  /C. islandicum/ by the smaller number of ribs. The animal, /C.\r\n  pinnulatum/, is said to be exceedingly lively and able to make\r\n  rapid progress over gravelly bottom by executing sudden leaps.\r\n  It has a long, recurved, very strong foot, and its movements are\r\n  effected as described above. It is abundant at Bar Harbor. [pg456]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~MYIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Mya^\r\n\r\nIn this family we encounter, rather suddenly, some new features not\r\nheretofore seen in the pelecypod structure. In the first place,\r\nthe siphons are enormously large, are united, and are surrounded\r\nby a leathery epidermis. The mantle-edges are fused together along\r\nthe entire ventral margin, except for a small slit through which\r\nthe foot may project. Although the animal may withdraw the long\r\nsiphons into its shell, yet they remain to a certain extent exposed,\r\nfor the valves gape widely posteriorly, and only slightly less\r\nso anteriorly. In the economy of these forms the shell seems to\r\nplay a less important part than it does in the /Veneridæ/, in the\r\n/Tellinidæ/, and generally in those families whose shells are strong\r\nand, closing firmly, afford the animal within a real protection. The\r\nshell of /Mya/ (the principal genus) is thin, white, and of a softer\r\nchalky texture; it gapes widely \"fore and aft,\" and has a loosely\r\nconstructed hinge apparatus, consisting of an erect projecting tooth,\r\nwhich fits into a pit in the opposite valve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Mya arenaria./]\r\n\r\n  ^M. arenaria.^ This is the common \"soft-shell clam\" of New England.\r\n  Its range is from Cape Cod to Greenland and Great Britain. Upon\r\n  the Maine coast it is very extensively gathered and sold to the\r\n  Banks fishermen for bait. Its use as food for man is probably not\r\n  very great, yet it is always to be seen on sale in the markets of\r\n  New England coast towns. It cannot compare in flavor with /Venus\r\n  mercenaria/, the \"hard-shell clam\" south of Cape Cod. /M. arenaria/\r\n  lives between tides in muddy, sandy, pebbly, or even rocky ground,\r\n  where it can find material in which it can burrow and hide itself.\r\n  It lies just below the surface, with its siphons projected into\r\n  the water. When the water recedes, /Mya/ draws in its siphons\r\n  and awaits the return of the tide, every now and then [pg457]\r\n  ejecting a jet of water into the air. The shells vary considerably\r\n  in size and thickness of valves. Large specimens are three and a\r\n  half inches long and two inches high. Our forefathers were not\r\n  always well posted upon the habits of mollusks, even though they\r\n  may have relished them in chowders and believed their flesh to\r\n  possess valuable curative properties. John Winthrop, in 1634, gave\r\n  a list of useful American animals, in which he remarked: \"Clam,\r\n  white; their broth is most excellent in all intermitting fevers,\r\n  consumption, etc. These clams feed only on sand.\" What marvelous\r\n  digestive powers!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Mya arenaria/, showing extended animal.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~SOLENIDÆ~\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Ensis directus/, showing extended animal: 1, foot; 2,\r\nsiphons; 3, papillæ, enlarged.]\r\n\r\nIn this family are included the long, slender bivalves commonly\r\nknown as \"razor-shells.\" Every one who has been to the sea-shore has\r\nbecome familiar with these odd-looking mollusks, for their valves\r\nare always to be found upon every beach. Their station is upon sandy\r\nflats or bars more or less exposed at low tide. They burrow into\r\nthe sand perpendicularly to a depth of two or three feet, remaining\r\nhidden most of the time. Occasionally a colony of them will be seen,\r\neach one projecting slightly from his burrow. If approached most\r\ncautiously some of them may be captured, but if the sand is jarred\r\nthey all take fright and disappear in an instant. It is no easy\r\nmatter to capture a \"razor\" when once he has taken warning, for he\r\nwill dig down into the sand about as fast as one can follow with a\r\nspade. A good way to catch one is to approach his burrow carefully,\r\nand then plunge a spade obliquely down below him, thereby [pg458]\r\ncutting off his retreat. So tenaciously will they cling to the sand\r\nby expanding the muscular foot that the shell may be pulled entirely\r\noff the body before they will let go.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ensis^\r\n\r\n  ^E. directus^ (^Solen ensis^, ^Ensis americanus^). The common\r\n  species upon the New England and Jersey coasts. The foot is long,\r\n  and protrudes from one end of the long shell; it is also very\r\n  strong, and capable of change at will into almost any form, from a\r\n  pointed bulb to a flat disk. The siphons, which project from the\r\n  opposite end of the shell, are short and are not united. The gills\r\n  are long. The juxtaposition of these organs is at first confusing,\r\n  because the greatly elongated form of the shell and the habits of\r\n  the animal in burrowing vertically into the sand have caused the\r\n  foot to be pushed farther away from the posterior portion of the\r\n  shell and to protrude in a direction just opposite to the siphons.\r\n  The shells are bent or slightly curved; they gape at both ends; and\r\n  they are fitted with very small interlocking teeth at the upper\r\n  corner of the posterior end. The color is white, but a yellowish or\r\n  greenish glossy epidermis covers the entire test. Length about six\r\n  inches. The manner in which the animal makes its rapid descent into\r\n  the sand is very interesting. First extending the foot lengthwise\r\n  into a point, it plunges it into the sand; then, by forcing water\r\n  into the organ it expands it, thus pushing away the sand on all\r\n  sides; and still further expanding the foot at the end into a disk,\r\n  it secures an anchorage which enables it to draw down its shell. By\r\n  quick repetition of this process /Ensis/ can get out of sight in a\r\n  remarkably sudden manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Ensis directus./]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Solen^\r\n\r\n  ^S. viridis.^ A smaller species, about two inches in length, and\r\n  with a nearly straight light-green shell. It is often abundant from\r\n  New Jersey southward.\r\n\r\n  ^S. sicarius.^ The common Californian species of Northern range. It\r\n  is only about two inches long, and is rounded anteriorly, but is\r\n  chopped off squarely behind. It is slightly curved and white, and\r\n  has a glossy brown epidermis.\r\n\r\n  ^S. rosaceus.^ Another species of Southern range, very similar\r\n  in form to the last, but straighter and rosy-white in color. The\r\n  epidermis is glossy brown. Length two inches. [pg459]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Tagelus^\r\n\r\n  ^T. gibbus.^ The extended range and shore station of this\r\n  exceedingly abundant species will cause it to be among the first\r\n  accessions to the cabinet of the collector south of Cape Cod. It\r\n  burrows deep in sand and mud, leaving two small openings to the\r\n  hole for the accommodation of its two excessively long siphons.\r\n  As in /Solen/ and /Ensis/, the foot is large and muscular,\r\n  tongue-shaped, and capable of remarkable change of form and great\r\n  freedom of movement. The long white siphons, separated from the\r\n  base and each provided with orange-colored eyes (or, rather, a\r\n  rudimentary sort of visual organs), are the most important feature.\r\n  The apex of the hinge is not, as in /Solen/ and /Ensis/, at the\r\n  end of the shell, but is more conventionally placed near the\r\n  middle; the cardinal teeth are very small, two upon each valve\r\n  and interlocking; a flat, oblong, callous process serves as a\r\n  fossette. The dorsal and ventral margins are parallel, and gape\r\n  at both ends; the shell is white, and is covered with a dense\r\n  yellowish epidermis, which, passing the ventral margin, appears to\r\n  become continuous with the thickened mantle-edge. There is no other\r\n  species north of Hatteras with which this could be confounded.\r\n  The double entrance to the burrow, which may be discovered about\r\n  low-tide mark, is unique. /T. gibbus/ is a good species to examine\r\n  for the crystalline stylet in the digestive tract.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Tagelus gibbus/, showing extended animal.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Tagelus gibbus./]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~GLYCIMERIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Glycimeris^\r\n\r\n  ^G. generosa.^ A large shell of the Pacific coast, occurring\r\n  most abundantly in Puget Sound waters, where it frequents muddy\r\n  shallows. It is a remarkable pelecypod in respect to its siphons\r\n  and the degree of mantle fusion. The appearance of the animal\r\n  is that of a huge pair of [pg460] united siphons, protected\r\n  laterally at their larger end by two white, widely gaping valves.\r\n  The very small pedal opening in the line or mantle juncture\r\n  indicates a very small foot. (Plate LXXXIV.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~PHOLADIDÆ~\r\n\r\nThere is a striking resemblance between the shells of this\r\nrock-boring family and those of the petricolas--a resemblance which\r\nconsists principally in the texture of the shell and the tendency\r\nto different types of sculpturing upon the posterior and anterior\r\nsurfaces of the valves.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Pholas^\r\n\r\nIn /Pholas/ the anterior part of the hinge-margin is reflected back\r\nover the umbones, and a long rib-like tooth springs from under the\r\numbonal region and curves out almost to the center of the valves.\r\nThe shell gapes \"fore and aft,\" and is thin, white, very hard, and\r\nbrittle. The animal has a short, truncated foot and a small orifice\r\nin the mantle through which the foot may be projected. The siphons\r\nare long and are united almost to their ends. Dorsally, an exposed\r\nportion of the animal is protected by accessory calcareous plates.\r\nThe habits of /Pholas/ are very interesting. It is found in holes\r\ngouged out of solid rock or out of pieces of wood; sometimes, like\r\n/Petricola/, it may be found excavating in hard clay. As the anterior\r\nend of a /Pholas/ shell is the larger in diameter, and is the end\r\nwhich is most deeply buried in the rock (the opening of the burrow\r\nbeing comparatively small), there was some mystery as to the way\r\nin which the creature manages to get inside its rocky dwelling.\r\nObservations in aquaria have shown that the young /Pholas/ begins his\r\nprocess of home-building very early in life. The wearing away of the\r\nstone is effected by constantly turning the shell around, scraping\r\nwith the anterior edges of the valves. A lodging-place having been\r\nsecured, /Pholas/ is obliged to work constantly to enlarge his burrow\r\nfor the accommodation of his growing shell. The long siphons may\r\nproject from the hole and draw in food and breath, but the animal is\r\na prisoner for life. When /Pholas/ has withdrawn his long siphons\r\nhe is reasonably secure from his enemies, but [pg461] nevertheless\r\nthousands of them are destroyed by predatory starfishes, who know\r\nhow to get at their victims. The restless crustaceans, ever on the\r\noutlook for a meal, often nip the siphons of the rock-dwellers, and\r\na kind of worm sometimes attacks them, and, destroying the animal,\r\nproceeds to occupy the empty shell and burrow.\r\n\r\n  ^P. costata.^ This species has a wide geographical range, being\r\n  found from Cape Cod to South America, but it is not abundant north\r\n  of Hatteras. In Florida it burrows deep in sand as well as in wood\r\n  or rock. On account of its white color and suggestive shape and\r\n  sculpture, it has received the popular name of \"angel's-wings.\" It\r\n  grows to a length of seven or eight inches.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Pholas costata./]\r\n\r\n  ^P. truncata.^ This has much the same range as the last, but is\r\n  more commonly to be found in New England waters. It also burrows\r\n  in any hard substance, or in mud above low-water mark. It is\r\n  especially common in peat-banks.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Pholas truncata./]\r\n\r\n  ^P. californica.^ A Californian /Pholas/. The shell is about three\r\n  inches in length, and resembles in all features and habits the\r\n  /Pholas/ of the east coast. Differences in the shell indicate that\r\n  it is a distinct species.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Zirphæa^\r\n\r\n  ^Z. crispata.^ A species of Northern range, occurring but sparingly\r\n  in New England, in hard clay or rocky burrows. It may be identified\r\n  at once by the furrow which passes from the beaks across the valves\r\n  to the lower edges of the shell and divides the surface of the\r\n  valve into two areas. The anterior area is decorated with radiating\r\n  toothed ribs; the posterior area is smooth. This conchological\r\n  feature of the genus is very [pg462] curious; it may be observed\r\n  also in several deep-sea genera and in certain extinct fossil\r\n  forms. The length of this shell is about two inches. This species\r\n  also occurs in California, where its favorite station is in hard\r\n  tenacious clay. Length two to four inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Zirphæa crispata./]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY ~TEREDINIDÆ~\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Teredo^\r\n\r\n  ^T. navalis.^ This species is worm-like in form, but it has a small\r\n  bivalve shell at the larger end, and near the anterior extremity\r\n  two calcareous appendages called pallets, beyond which extend two\r\n  siphons. Along the surface of the mantle is secreted a continuous\r\n  shelly tube which lines the burrow. This mollusk, commonly called\r\n  the \"ship-worm,\" is exceedingly destructive, perforating with its\r\n  burrows submerged timber and soon rendering it useless. Various\r\n  means are taken to protect ships, the piles of wharves, buoys, and\r\n  the like, against its ravages; copper sheathing, large-headed nails\r\n  driven close together into the wood, verdigris paint, and so on,\r\n  being used with more or less effect. Vast numbers of these animals\r\n  enter the wood and burrow in various directions, but they never\r\n  interfere with one another, a thin partition of wood always being\r\n  left between adjacent burrows. How they effect the burrowing is\r\n  not determined, but it is supposed to be by means of the pallets.\r\n  /Teredo/ does not, like the boring isopod /Limnoria lignorum/, feed\r\n  upon the wood. Its food consists of microscopic organisms which\r\n  are taken in through the incurrent siphon. In temperate waters /T.\r\n  navalis/ grows sometimes to the length of six inches; in tropical\r\n  waters it attains the length of two feet.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: /Teredo navalis/, in a piece of timber: /P/,\r\n  pallets; /SS/, siphons; /T/, tube; /V/, valve of shell.]\r\n\r\n  There are three other species of /Teredo/ and one of the genus\r\n  /Xylotrya/ on our Northern shores; /T. navalis/ is, however, the\r\n  most common and most destructive. In Southern waters there are many\r\n  other forms of these boring mollusks.

When looking at this shell before opening\r\n  it, one naturally wonders where the animal finds room to exist\r\n  between two such disk-like valves. The animal is very thin, with\r\n  largely united mantle-edges, widely separated feeble adductor\r\n  muscles, and a fairly large tongue-shaped foot. The shell is\r\n  nacreous, rounded anteriorly, and produced posteriorly into a sort\r\n  of upturned tip which gapes to accommodate two little siphons. The\r\n  dorsal hinge-margin is excavated and curved. Length about one inch.\r\n  It is abundant at Cape Cod, in sandy stations, on oyster-beds, and\r\n  is found from Maine to Florida.

But the\r\nclass bears the stamp of its origin in a mantle, a radula, and a\r\ndisposition of internal organs and functions which, although highly\r\nperfected, is essentially molluscan.\r\n\r\nAlong the Atlantic coast of the United States, particularly in its\r\nnorthern portion, occur several examples of cephalopods belonging to\r\nthe genera /Ommastrephes/ and /Loligo/, all the species of which are\r\nreferred to, in common parlance, as \"squids.\" They frequent shallow\r\nwater, and are often to be found in weirs, darting about with rapid,\r\nspasmodic movements, or perhaps lying motionless on the bottom.\r\nThe squids enter the weirs for the purpose of capturing the young\r\nmackerel which are caught in these traps. The squid lies quietly upon\r\nthe bottom, which it simulates so closely in color as to be almost\r\ninvisible, and when [pg465] a school of fishes swims over it, darts\r\nsuddenly into the midst of it, seizes a fish with its sucker-bearing\r\narms, and kills it by the bite of its parrot-like beak or jaws.\r\nSometimes it happens that squids, while pursuing fish too near shore,\r\nprecipitate themselves upon the beach, where they flounder about,\r\nejecting water from their siphons, which pushes them only farther\r\naway from the water, and squirting out \"ink\" from their ink-sacs in\r\na vain endeavor to hide themselves from view. On bright moonlight\r\nnights squids often go ashore in vast numbers, and perish within a\r\nfew inches of their native element, which they seem to be unable\r\nto regain. These creatures usually swim backward, and the theory\r\nis that, dazzled by the bright light of the moon, they continue to\r\ngaze at it while swimming, and if there happens to be a shore in the\r\ndirection of their movements, they suddenly find themselves beached.\r\nThe fishermen of Canada and New England take advantage of this habit\r\nand capture great quantities of squids by placing bright lights in\r\nthe bows of their boats and then rowing toward shore, thus driving\r\nthe squids out of the water. The Banks fishermen use them as bait\r\nfor catching cod. The right claimed by American fishing-schooners to\r\npurchase squids in Newfoundland has helped to keep alive the quarrel\r\nbetween Canadian and American fishermen, which has vexed their\r\nrespective governments for many years.\r\n\r\nThe range in size among the species of this class is very remarkable.\r\nThe little sepiolas are about an inch long; the squids of our\r\ncoasts vary in length from eight inches to one foot; and the giant\r\n/Architeuthis/ of the North Atlantic measures, often, fifty feet\r\nfrom the end of its arms to the tip of its tail. Such a creature,\r\nwith its long arms provided with suckers, its powerful jaws, and its\r\nrapid, alert movements, is a formidable foe. These animals have been\r\nthe basis of many legends about sea-serpents and sea-monsters. A\r\ngruesome story of an octopus is told by Victor Hugo in \"The Toilers\r\nof the Sea,\" where he gives a thrilling account of a man's encounter\r\nwith a devil-fish in a cave. One who has read this tale has a vivid\r\npicture in his mind of the giant squid, and the danger of meeting\r\none of these many-armed foes. Victor Hugo's devil-fish, [pg466]\r\nhowever, is an animal not true to nature, but a composite, having\r\nthe attributes of the polyp and of the octopus, and the name of a\r\nlarge ray of Southern waters, a real fish, the /Cephaloptera/, known\r\nin its localities as devil-fish. This monstrosity of the novelist's\r\nimagination has, however, done more to acquaint the general public\r\nwith these interesting cephalopods than have the descriptions of\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\nThe giant squid, which is such a dangerous foe, has its own enemy in\r\nthe sperm-whale. The cachalot swims through the water with its lower\r\njaw hanging, the cephalopod grasps the jaw, and the whale then shuts\r\nhis capacious mouth upon it. Whalemen describe conflicts between\r\nthese enormous creatures, the whale always being the conqueror.\r\nSperm-whales killed by man often eject great quantities of the squids\r\nin their death throes, showing this food to be almost their exclusive\r\ndiet.\r\n\r\nThe name \"cephalopod,\" meaning \"feet around the head,\" is descriptive\r\nin part of their anatomy. The head is usually marked off by a\r\nneck-constriction, and it bears two highly organized eyes. The foot\r\nis fused in part with the head above the eyes and around the mouth;\r\non the upper side it is divided into eight or ten long arm-like\r\nprocesses, bearing suckers, which act as organs of prehension. The\r\nunder part of the foot forms a tube called the funnel. Through the\r\nfunnel the animal expels water from the mantle cavity, and thus\r\npropels itself through the water.\r\n\r\nThe mantle covers the body of the animal, and is a cup-shaped or\r\nconical envelope, open only at the anterior end, through which\r\nproject the head and siphon or funnel. It is attached to the body by\r\na line on the dorsal side, the anterior margin being free and open,\r\nbut provided with an arrangement of cartilages by which it can be\r\nhooked on to the siphon, thus completely closing the entrance to\r\nthe mantle cavity. The mantle is very muscular, and is constantly\r\nexpanding and contracting, taking water into the mantle cavity\r\nthrough the mantle opening for respiratory purposes, or expelling\r\nit through the siphon for propulsion; in the latter case the mantle\r\nopening is closed at the moment of ejecting the water. When the\r\nsiphon is in its normal position [pg467] the animal swims backward;\r\nbut it can be turned back over the edge of the mantle, giving a\r\nforward movement.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the mantle is covered with pigment-cells\r\n(/chromatophores/). There are sets of chromatophores containing\r\ndifferent colors. The cells are opened or closed at will by muscular\r\naction of their walls. When open the cells seem to fuse together,\r\ngiving a solid color-surface, or spots of color as desired, in blue,\r\nred, yellow, or brown; when closed they seem as specks on the almost\r\ntransparent tissues of the animal. Flashes of changing color follow\r\none another with great rapidity over the living animal. In swimming\r\nit assumes the color of its surroundings.\r\n\r\nAnother curious means of protection possessed by the dibranchiate\r\ncephalopods is an ink-bag, the brown or black secretions of which are\r\nejected through the siphon, clouding the water when the animal wishes\r\nto escape from danger. The ink taken from the ink-sac of /Sepia/ is\r\nan article of commerce.\r\n\r\nOnly /Nautilus/ and the female /Argonauta/ have the characteristic\r\nexternal shell of mollusks. In all other forms the shell is internal\r\nor is invested in the integument of the mantle. Of such is the\r\ncuttlebone of commerce, which is a calcareous leaf-like body obtained\r\nfrom /Sepia/, the cuttlefish. The common squid /Loligo/ has a horny\r\nsubstance situated in the dorsal side of the mantle, called the pen.\r\n/Spirula/ has a spiral internal shell divided into chambers. Vast\r\nnumbers of these shells are cast upon the beaches of the Pacific\r\nIslands, and they have also been found on the shore of Nantucket.\r\n\r\nCephalopods are separated into two subclasses. In the first, the\r\n/Tetrabranchiata/, there are four branchiæ, four nephridia, and four\r\nauricles. They are without an ink-sac, and have the foot divided into\r\nlobes bearing sheathed tentacles. /Nautilus/ is the only genus.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCLASS =TETRABRANCHIATA=\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Nautilus^\r\n\r\nProbably the best-known cephalopod is /Nautilus/--the pearly-shelled,\r\nchambered nautilus made immortal in the beautiful poem of Oliver\r\nWendell Holmes. The shell of /Nautilus/ is a flat spiral; the\r\ninterior is divided by septa forming a series of chambers; [pg468]\r\nthe septa are perforated, and through the opening runs a tube or\r\nprolongation of the body, the siphuncle, which extends to the tip of\r\nthe shell. The chambers are filled with gas. The animal in the course\r\nof its growth moves forward into a newly formed chamber and builds a\r\nnew septum, closing the cavity last occupied. /Nautilus/ lives among\r\nthe coral reefs of the southern Pacific. Its four or five species are\r\nthe remnants of a once very extensive race of cephalopods. The fossil\r\nremains of many species of /Nautilus/, together with various other\r\ngenera of shell-bearing cephalopods, indicate that this group has\r\nseen its best days. The dibranchiate genera, however, appear to have\r\nreached their maximum at the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBCLASS =DIBRANCHIATA=\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Argonauta argo/, female removed from shell.]\r\n\r\nThe second subclass, the /Dibranchiata/, is characterized by two\r\nbranchiæ and two auricles. The main part of the foot is divided into\r\neight or ten long arms provided with numerous suckers arranged in\r\nfrom one to four rows on the ventral side of the arms. They have\r\nalso an ink-sac. The /Dibranchiata/ are divided into two orders: the\r\n/Octopoda/, which have eight arms, and comprise the /Octopus/ and\r\n/Argonauta/; and the /Decapoda/, which have ten arms, and comprise\r\n/Spirula/, /Ommastrephes/, /Sepia/, and /Loligo/. In these animals\r\ntwo of the ten arms are longer than the others, and these tentacular\r\narms have suckers only on their broadened, club-like ends, they are\r\nkept retracted within grooves, one on each side of the head, except\r\nwhen needed for prehension. [pg469]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Argonauta^\r\n\r\n  ^A. argo.^ In this species, the paper-nautilus, the shell, which is\r\n  possessed only by the female, is not chambered. The animal rests in\r\n  the shell, but has no organic connection with it other than by the\r\n  membranous expansions at the extremities of the two dorsal arms,\r\n  which secrete it and hold it in place. The purpose of the shell is\r\n  to hold and protect the eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Argonauta argo/, side view of shell.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Loligo^\r\n\r\n  ^L. Pealei.^ In this species the body is cylindrical, tapers to a\r\n  point, and has a flat appendage in front. The fins are terminal,\r\n  half, or more than half, as long as the body, united in a point\r\n  posteriorly, and obtusely rounded on the outer angles. The head\r\n  is a little narrower than the mantle. There are eight sessile,\r\n  sub-triangular arms furnished with two series of suckers which\r\n  are hemispherical and stalked, and two long retractile tentacular\r\n  arms dilated at the extremities, bearing four rows of suckers. It\r\n  has a pen- or quill-shaped cartilaginous substance in the dorsal\r\n  integument of the mantle. Common from Cape Cod to South Carolina.\r\n\r\n  ^L. brevis.^ A small short-bodied species, with short rounded\r\n  caudal fins. It is common from South Carolina to Florida, and\r\n  extends as far north as Delaware Bay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Loligo Pealei/, young female; dorsal view.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Ommastrephes^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Ommastrephes illecebrosus/, young male; ventral view.]\r\n\r\n  ^O. illecebrosus.^ A species similar to /L. Pealei/, but with\r\n  shorter fins. These are broad and pear-shaped, one third wider than\r\n  they are long, and usually reach less than one half the length of\r\n  the mantle. They are straight on the posterior end, and form nearly\r\n  a right angle, while the upper margins are rounded. The head is\r\n  as broad as the mantle. The arms are stout and taper to an acute\r\n  point. The tentacular arms are long when expanded. The species\r\n  is abundant from Cape Cod to Newfoundland, and is found as far\r\n  south as Newport, Rhode Island. This is the squid which is used so\r\n  extensively in the Banks fishery as bait. It [pg470] visits the\r\n  shores in large schools, presumably in pursuit of prey, and often\r\n  itself becomes the victim. It is a beautiful creature from its\r\n  varying colors, which are truly wonderful. It changes in a moment\r\n  from vivid red to deep blue, purple, orange, and so on, the colors\r\n  often passing over it in flashes as it swims along.

The /simple ascidians/ are\r\npeculiar leathery, sac-shaped bodies which send out jets of water\r\nwhen touched. This habit gives them the common name of \"sea-squirts.\"\r\nSome are highly colored, especially those of Southern waters; others\r\nare somber, unattractive bodies, often growing in masses. The\r\n/compound ascidians/ are gelatinous colonies, sometimes forming thin\r\nincrustations, sometimes jelly-like masses, on seaweeds, shells,\r\netc. This class comprises also the beautiful /Salpa/, a genus of\r\nfree-swimming animals having transparent bodies encircled by rings of\r\nmuscular bands, and in one stage forming chains of attached organisms\r\nwhich swim on the surface of the sea and of bays.\r\n\r\nThe tunicates are by some authors classed with the vertebrate\r\nanimals because in the larval stage they have a notochord; this\r\ndisappears, however, in the adult form, and the animals are\r\nconsidered degenerates. The tunicates are interesting to biologists\r\nfrom the remarkable changes they undergo in their life-history, and\r\n(in some genera) the marked phase of alternation of generation. One\r\nof their curious anatomical features is the blood-vascular system.\r\nThe circulation is propelled by wave-like contractions of the heart,\r\nwhich, after forcing the blood one way for a time, stops and reverses\r\nthe blood-current. The tunicates are widely distributed, and occur at\r\nall depths. (Plate LXXXV.) [pg475]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Salpa^\r\n\r\n[Illustration: /Salpa/ chain.]\r\n\r\nThe animals of this genus are transparent, subcylindrical, smooth,\r\ngelatinous bodies encircled by bands of white muscular fiber. They\r\nstrikingly exemplify alternation of generations. They occur in two\r\ndistinct conditions, one being solitary, the other consisting of\r\nanimals united in chains. The solitary individuals are about an inch\r\nlong, and have two long processes at the posterior end. These single\r\nanimals reproduce by budding, and form series of individuals in small\r\nchains, the animals being arranged in two rows. The chains grow to\r\nthe length of a foot or more, and contain twenty to thirty pairs\r\nof salpas. Each of these connected individuals produces in turn a\r\nsingle egg, which becomes a single /Salpa/, and this again, like its\r\ngrandmother, reproduces by budding. Thus the animals are alike only\r\nin alternate generations. The naturalist Chamisso, who discovered\r\nthe relationship between the two forms, expressed it as follows: a\r\n/Salpa/ mother is not like its daughter or its mother, but resembles\r\nits sister, its grandmother, and its granddaughter. The single zoöids\r\nliberate many colonies during the summer, which grow rapidly, and in\r\nthe autumn the chains are exceedingly abundant. The /Salpa/ chains\r\nswim about with a serpentine movement, and are beautiful, delicate\r\nobjects with their transparent bodies banded with white, tinged with\r\npink, and streaked with blue.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPLE ASCIDIANS\r\n\r\nThese are solitary and usually fixed; they are never free-swimming,\r\nand when in colonies each animal has a distinct test. All the larger\r\nascidians, or sea-squirts, belong to this group.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Molgula^\r\n\r\nBody more or less globular, membranous, attached or free; orifices on\r\nvery contractile tubes.\r\n\r\n  ^M. manhattensis.^ Nearly globular when the tubes are contracted;\r\n  usually covered with bits of eel-grass, seaweeds, sand, etc.;\r\n  surface a [pg476] little rough; color olive-green. The animal is\r\n  often attached to rocks, more frequently to eel-grass and seaweeds,\r\n  and is sometimes so crowded as to form large clusters. Found from\r\n  Maine to North Carolina.\r\n\r\n  ^M. pellucida.^ Body nearly globular, about an inch in diameter,\r\n  smooth, clean, and translucent, the intestine showing through the\r\n  test.

The colonies thus formed are flat and\r\nincrusting, or are branched and lobed, or sometimes elevated on\r\nstalks. The zoöids are in some cases dotted irregularly over the\r\nentire surface, in others are in rows, or again are in groups. They\r\nhave various colors--purple, yellow, blue, gray, and green. They are\r\ncommon on eel-grass, the piles of wharves, the bottoms of boats, and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Botryllus^\r\n\r\n  ^B. gouldii.^ This species forms thick, fleshy, translucent\r\n  incrustations, often several inches in length and a quarter of an\r\n  inch wide, over eel-grass, the piles of wharves, and other objects.\r\n  Sometimes, at the end of summer, small objects are completely\r\n  covered with the luxuriant growth of this compound ascidian. The\r\n  zoöids form circular or elliptical groups, often as many as fifteen\r\n  surrounding each orifice, looking like minute stars. The colonies\r\n  vary in color. Often on the same stem of eel-grass will be found\r\n  separate colonies varying in this respect. In some the ground-color\r\n  will be olive-green specked with white, while the zoöids are\r\n  purple, marked with other colors; again the arrangement is quite\r\n  different.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ^Amaræcium^\r\n\r\n  ^A. pellucidum.^ A massive compound ascidian, smooth, translucent,\r\n  and gelatinous, which forms large, hemispherical, complex,\r\n  irregular masses six inches or more in diameter. It is usually\r\n  covered by adhering sand. The mass consists of club-shaped lobes,\r\n  which rise from a common base. Each lobe contains a central orifice\r\n  around which long, slender zoöids, sometimes an inch long, are\r\n  grouped. These masses are so abundant in some places that they\r\n  cover the bottom for considerable spaces. They are found in deep\r\n  water from Cape Cod to North Carolina.

Page numbers from the printed 1901\r\nedition are indicated like this: \"[pg235]\".\r\n\r\nAs mentioned on page 29 of the book, typography was used in a\r\nspecific way to visually distinguish various taxonomic classes.\r\nThis simple text edition will indicate text that was originally\r\nprinted with both small-caps and bold applied with \"~\", e.g.\r\n\"Suborder ~CHÆTANGIEÆ~\". Text that originally had both italics\r\nand bold applied is indicated herein by \"^\". Thus \"Species ^L.\r\nmajuscula^\". Text that was originally small-caps with or without\r\nbold is all uppercase. Text that was originally italics without\r\nbold is displayed herein with \"/\", thus \"Genus /Griffithsia/\". Text\r\nthat was originally bold without italics or small caps is indicated\r\nwith \"=\", thus \"Class =ALGÆ=\". The original variations in font-size\r\nare not carried into this version.\r\n\r\nMany of the biological classification schemes shown in this book were\r\nprinted with large curly brackets \"{\" extending several lines high.\r\nFor example, on page 18, a classification scheme was printed similar\r\nto this:\r\n\r\n  /Rhodymeniaceæ/,    {/Callithamnion/\r\n     suborder         {/Griffithsia/\r\n    /Ceramieæ/        {/Ceramium/\r\n\r\nexcept that the three \"{\" were not printed, but were replaced by\r\na single tall \"{\". This typography does not generally work well\r\nin current electronic books. Therefore, tables or schemes of this\r\nsort have (except on page 18) been replaced by a different format\r\n(nested list with tables) employing rearrangement and indentation,\r\nwithout curly brackets--like this:\r\n\r\n  Order /Rhodymeniaceæ/\r\n\r\n    Suborder /Ceramieæ/\r\n\r\n      Genera\r\n\r\n      /Callithamnion/\r\n      /Griffithsia/\r\n      /Ceramium/\r\n\r\nThere are rare instances when this could cause confusion. For\r\nexample, the partial paragraph that preceeds the page 18 example\r\nshown above:\r\n\r\n  The genera of an order are then placed within a cover and labeled\r\n  in the same way, the legend then having the name of the order on\r\n  the left and the genera on the right of the bracket, thus:\r\n\r\nrefers to a bracket no longer present in this version, and \"left\" and\r\n\"right\" are perhaps no longer meaningful.\r\n\r\nPage 102: \"flagell[oe]te Infusoria\" was changed to \"flagellate\r\nInfusoria\" to match the corresponding index entry.\r\n\r\nPage 150: in \"The strictures forming the lobes\", changed \"strictures\"\r\nto \"structures\".\r\n\r\nPage 154: changed \"rhododaciyla\" to \"rhododactyla\".\r\n\r\nPage 172: changed \"perisaltic\" to \"peristaltic\".\r\n\r\nPage 188: in the table showing the classification of the Mulluscoida,\r\nthere are grouping words such as \"Articulata\", \"Inarticulata\", and\r\n\"Flustrina\", which are not labeled as to whether they are taxonomic\r\n\"Family\", or some other class. The transcriber has chosen to label\r\nthem \"Set\", which term is not elsewhere used in the book to denote a\r\nformal taxonomic class. The same sort of thing is done on a few other\r\npages, e.g. on page 240, for the group \"Free-swimming Forms\".\r\n\r\nPage 196: \"Phyllopora\" changed to \"Phyllophora\"--a guess.\r\n\r\nPage 216 (facing), Plate LV.: \"Ophiocoma [oe]thiops\" changed to\r\n\"Ophiocoma æthiops\".\r\n\r\nPage 233: \"rows\" to \"Rows\", in \"rows of tube-feet lie near together,\".\r\n\r\nPage 239, and perhaps elsewhere: notes such as \"without gills or\r\nthoracic legs\" that were printed with the Genera, in this example\r\n/Mysis/, have been moved into the note attached to a next higher\r\ntaxonomic class, i.e. Order Schizopoda, with added text necessary for\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\nPage 362: \"f   dation\" to \"foundation\" in \"greenish-white nacreous\r\nf   dation\".\r\n\r\nPage 486: the index entry \"Pacific faunal divisions\" had no page\r\nnumber. The number \"=311=\" seems correct, and has been inserted.\r\n\r\nIndex, \"Endendrium ramosum, Plate XLI.\" entry is removed, and \"Plate\r\nXLI\" is added to entry \"Eudendrium ramosum\".\r\n\r\nIndex, entry \"Ventricosa\" changed to \"Ventricose\".\r\n\r\nCorrigenda: The corrections listed therein have been applied to the\r\ntext. In addition to the listed corrections, there were two other\r\ninstances of \"lunales\", on pp 225 and 226, now changed to \"lunules\";\r\nalso \"lunale\" to \"lunule\" on p 225.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Sea-beach at Ebb-tide, by Augusta Foote Arnold",
