B.\r\nLIPPINCOTT & Co., in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note: Minor typos have been corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW HYPERION.\r\n\r\nFROM PARIS TO MARLY BY WAY OF THE RHINE.\r\n\r\nV.--IN PURSUIT OF A PASSPORT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SIGN OF THE \"STORK\".]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Strasburgers have a legend--\"\r\n\r\nWe were rolling along very comfortably in the engineer's coach. From\r\npavement to bridge, and from bridge to pavement, we effected the long\r\nstep which bestrides the Rhine.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you would prick your ears up at the word. Well, I have found a\r\nlegend among the people here about the original acquisition of Strasburg\r\nby the French. You know Louis XIV. bagged the city quite unwarrantably\r\nin 1681, in a time of peace.\"\r\n\r\nI was much delighted with this beginning, and told my friend that to\r\ncross the storied Rhine and simultaneously listen to a legend made me\r\nfeel as if I were Frithiof the Viking entertained on his voyage by a\r\nSkald.\r\n\r\n\"The Alsatians will have it,\" said my canal-digger, \"that the Grand\r\nMonarch was a bit of a magician. The depth of what I may call his\r\nHigh-Church sentiment, which at last proved so edifying to the\r\nMaintenon, has never convinced them that he wasn't a trifle in league\r\nwith the devil. At the foot of his praying-chair was always chained a\r\nlittle casket of ebony, bound with iron. In this he imprisoned a little\r\nyellow man, a demon of the most concentrated structure, hardly a foot\r\nlong. This goblin ran through the air, on an errand or with a letter,\r\nabout as fast as a stroke of lightning, and admirably filled the place\r\nof the modern telegraph. For each meal he took three seeds of hemp,\r\nwhich he loved to receive from the king's hand. By and by the little\r\nyellow man became more of a gourmand. He demanded seed-pearls, and the\r\nking was obliged to rob the queen's jewel-boxes. Then the yellow dwarf's\r\nappetite changed, and he required stars, orders and garters: one by one\r\nthe obedient monarch gave him the decorations of count, marquis, duke.\r\nThe demon's name was Chamillo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GRAND MONARCH AND A LITTLE YELLOW IMP.]\r\n\r\n\"One day the small devil-duke of a Chamillo hovered over the imperial\r\nfree city of Strasburg. Entering by key-holes and doors ajar, he stole\r\ninto the presence of the principal magistrates, and shortly after the\r\nimpregnable capital of Alsace opened its gates at a show of French\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n\"For this important service Louis XIV. fancied that Chamillo would\r\nrequire the letters patent constituting him a prince. Not at all.\r\nChamillo was tired of secular honors: he had seen the bishop of\r\nStrasburg officiating in scarlet, and he insisted on being made\r\ncardinal. The king could not make cardinals, and he doubted whether he\r\ncould induce the pope to receive a devil among the upper clergy. He\r\nrefused absolutely. Chamillo left him in dudgeon and went over to\r\nPrussia. Apparently he has remained there. At any rate, the French\r\nking's fortunes commenced at that epoch to decline, and the Peace of\r\nRyswick almost deprived him of Strasburg, which the little yellow man\r\nwanted to get back for Germany.\"\r\n\r\nWe had quitted Strasburg by the gate of Austerlitz. While listening to\r\nmy friend I kept an eye open, and examined the present state of the\r\nfortress, the incidents of the road to Kehl, and that fairy Ile des\r\nÉpis, a perfect little Eden in the Rhine, where the tall trees and\r\nnodding flowers bury the tomb of Dessaix, with its inscription, \"À\r\nDessaix, l'Armée du Rhin, 1800.\" This bright morning-ride enchanted me,\r\nseasoned as it was with a goblin-story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILE DES ÉPIS.]\r\n\r\n\"Behind this tale, now, there must be a fact,\" I said. \"There is some\r\nbit of history concealed there. The common people never invent: they\r\ndistort.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible,\" he answered. \"I tell you the story as it was told me\r\nby one of my theodolite-bearers. You may find out the rest: it is in\r\nyour line.\"\r\n\r\nKehl has been bombarded or razed a dozen times by French armies crossing\r\nthe Rhine. The last occasion when the French ruined it, however, was\r\nnot in vain-glory, but in impotent malice. They fired it on August 19,\r\n1870, during the horrors of the Strasburg bombardment. It is a town\r\nformed of a single street--But I will enter no further into topographic\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEGGARS AT BÂLE.]\r\n\r\nI entered this town or street in haste, leaving my engineering\r\nacquaintance talking to a Prussian general. The idea had seized me of\r\nwriting a line to Hohenfels at Marly, actually dated from the grand\r\nduchy of Baden. Undoubtedly I should reach Marly before my letter, but\r\nthe postal mark would be a good proof of the actuality of my wanderings.\r\nClinging, then, to my childishness, as we do to most of our follies,\r\nwith a fidelity which it would be well to imitate in our grave affairs,\r\nand feeling pressed for time, I looked eagerly around for a\r\nresting-place where I could procure ink and paper, and entered at the\r\nsign of the \"Stork.\" I found a smoky crowd, peasants and military,\r\nsucking German pipes and drinking from a variety of glasses, pots,\r\nsyphons and jugs. I had taken up my pen when an individual by my side,\r\nat the next table, said to his opposite neighbor, \"The French will\r\nhardly take Strasburg again by surprise, as they did two centuries ago.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW THINGS FELL OUT.]\r\n\r\n\"It was not the French who took Strasburg,\" replied the _vis-à-vis_,\r\nevidently a native: \"it was _the little urchin in yellow_.\"\r\n\r\nThe expression, joined to what I had just heard in the carriage, was\r\nsufficient to attract my attention. My neighbor, a Belgian by his\r\naccent, opened his eyes. The man opposite, perceiving that he had more\r\nthan one auditor, narrated at length, in substance and detail, not the\r\nfairy legend of the Alsatians, but accurately and to my amusement, the\r\nhistorical anecdote which I had imagined to be wrapped up in that tale.\r\nSo then, while he spoke, I wrote--no longer to Hohenfels, but to my own\r\nconsciousness and memory--these little notes on Chamillo, or rather\r\nChamilly, and obtained a trifling contribution to the back-stairs\r\nhistory of the Grand Nation.\r\n\r\n\"The marquis of Chamilly, afterward marshal of France, was often\r\npromised a good place for a young nephew he had by the powerful\r\nMinister de Louvois. Each time, however, that the youth presented\r\nhimself the experienced minister said, 'Bide your time, young man: I see\r\nnothing yet on the horizon worthy of you.' The boy sulked in the\r\ntortures of hope deferred. One day in September, 1681, Louvois said,\r\n'Young man, post yourself at Bâle on the 18th day of this month, from\r\nnoon to four o'clock: stand on the bridge; take a note of all you see,\r\nwithout the least omission; come back and report to me; and as you\r\nacquit yourself so your future shall be.' The young chevalier found\r\nhimself on the bridge at Bâle at high noon. He expected to meet some\r\ndeputation from the Swiss cantons, with the great landamman at the head.\r\nWhat he really saw were carts, villagers, flocks of sheep, children who\r\nchased each other, mendicants who, with Swiss independence, demanded\r\nalms rather than begged it. He gave to each, imagining in each a\r\nmysterious agent. An old woman crossing the bridge on a bucking donkey,\r\nwho threw her, he picked up obsequiously, not knowing but this fall\r\nmight be a manoeuvre of state, and the precipitate take the form of\r\nthe landamman in disguise: he had even the idea of running after the\r\ndonkey, but the animal was already galloping with great relish outside\r\nthe assigned limits to his diplomacy. When tired of the sun, the dust\r\nand the triviality of the panorama, Chamilly prepared to go. It was\r\nnearing the hour fixed for his departure, and the absence of all\r\nsignificant events vexed him. As if to put a crown on his discomfiture,\r\ntoward the close of the last hour an odd little urchin, grotesquely\r\ndressed in a yellow coat, came to beat old blankets over the parapet,\r\nand flirted the dirt and fluff into the young man's eyes. Already\r\nangered, he was about to hang the young imp for a minute or two over the\r\nbridge, when four o'clock sounded, his duty came to his mind, and he\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LITTLE IMP IN YELLOW]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE TRAIN IS STARTING\"]\r\n\r\n\"In the middle of the third night, tired and humiliated, he reappeared\r\nbefore the minister and recounted his failure. When he came to the\r\nlittle page in yellow, Louvois fell on his neck and kissed him. Chamilly\r\nwas dragged incontinently before the king. Louis XIV., who was snoring\r\nwith his royal nose in the air, was waked for the purpose, and heard\r\nwith attention the story of the beggars, the donkey and the little\r\nmonkey in yellow livery. At the apparition of the Yellow Jacket, Louis\r\nXIV. leaped over the _ruelle_ and danced a saraband in his night-gown.\r\nChamilly might perhaps have considered himself sufficiently rewarded in\r\nbeing the only man who ever saw the superb king dancing with bare legs\r\nin a wig hastily put on crosswise. But to this recompense others were\r\nadded. The monarch named him chevalier of his orders, count and\r\ncounselor of state, to the grand stupefaction of the young man, who\r\nunderstood nothing about it.\r\n\r\n\"The little yellow urchin, shaking his blankets, announced to the king's\r\nenvoy, on the part of the perjured Strasburg magistrates, that the city\r\nwas betrayed.\"\r\n\r\nI had now that rare complementing pair, a legend and its historical\r\nfoundation. I had been obliged to cross the Rhine to obtain my prize,\r\nbut I did not regret the journey. How far I was from fancying the\r\nill-natured turn that the little yellow man was playing me!\r\n\r\nWhile my neighbor of the Stork was talking, and I was taking down his\r\nwords with my utmost rapidity, Time took advantage of me, and put double\r\nthe accustomed length into each of his steps. On recrossing into\r\nStrasburg I had before me barely the moments necessary to regain the\r\nrailway station.\r\n\r\nThe gate at the first-class passenger-exit was about closing, fifteen\r\nminutes in advance of the start, according to the European custom. I\r\npushed in rather roughly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"JUSTICE AND VENGEANCE PURSUING CRIME\"]\r\n\r\nThe railway-officer or porter was at the gate, barring my passage until\r\nI could exhibit a ticket. I had not taken time to purchase one: the\r\ntrain was fuming and threatening the belated passengers with a series of\r\nfalse starts. Surprised into rudeness, and quite forgetting that my\r\nappearance warranted no airs of autocracy, I made some contemptuous\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n\"Der Herr is much too hasty. Der Herr is doubtless provided with the\r\nnecessary papers which will enable him to pass the French frontier.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not the porter who spoke now: it was some kind of official relic\r\nor shadow or mouchard left from the old custom-house, and suffered to\r\nhang on the railway-station as an ornament. His costume, half uniform\r\nand half fatigue-dress, compromised nobody, and was surmounted by a\r\nskull cap. His pantaloons were short, his figure was paunchy,\r\nauthoritative and German. His German, however, was spoken with a French\r\naccent. As I mused in stupefaction upon the hint he had uttered, he\r\npointed with his hand. \"The train is starting,\" he observed.\r\n\r\nThe reader probably knows Prudhon's great picture in the Louvre,\r\noriginally painted for the Palace of Justice, and entitled \"Divine\r\nJustice and Vengeance in Pursuit of Crime\"? This picture, which I had\r\nnot thought of, I suppose, for an age, suddenly seemed to be realized\r\nbefore me, but the heavenly detectives were changed into mortal\r\ngendarmes. The porter and the nondescript threw back the gate,\r\npreventing my passage. The terrors of Prudhon's avenging spirits were\r\nall expressed, to my thinking, in the looks which these two official\r\npeople exchanged in my favor, and then bent on me. We stood in a\r\ntriangle.\r\n\r\n\"One moment: I propose a plan,\" I cried in desperation. \"I do not know a\r\nsoul in Strasburg, and the friend who brought me here is gone, I cannot\r\ntell whither. But I have an acquaintance in the British consulate at\r\nCarlsruhe--Berkley, you know,\" I explained with an insane familiarity,\r\n\"my old friend Berkley's nephew. Admit me to the train, and we will\r\ntelegraph to him. His reply will come in ten minutes, and will show you\r\nmy responsible character. I have come fifteen minutes in advance of the\r\nstarting-hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wire to Carlsruhe,\" said the porter, \"is under repairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"The train to Paris,\" said the second man, \"is off.\"\r\n\r\nSome fate was pursuing me. Rudely rejected at the wicket, and treated as\r\na man without a nationality, I felt as if I had but one friend now\r\navailable on earth--the friend who had come into my head while\r\nconversing with the railway guard. Old Mr. Berkley, Mr. Sylvester.\r\nBerkley and I had once breakfasted together at Brighton, the first\r\nsitting in a tub, the second eating nothing but raw macerated beef, and\r\nI for my part devouring toast and Icelandic poetry. The nephew had since\r\ngone into diplomacy to strengthen his bile. I had not seen him for\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nI approached the schedule of distances hanging on the wall. My movements\r\nwere those of a man prostrated and resigned. I ran my forefinger over\r\nthe departures from Kohl to Carlsruhe.\r\n\r\nIn three hours I was in the latter city.\r\n\r\nIt was not in beggar's guise that Paul Flemming would fain be seen in\r\nthe capital of the grand duchy--the most formal capital, the most\r\nsymmetrical capital, the most monumental capital, as it is the youngest\r\ncapital, in Europe. Nor was it as a vagabond that he would wish to\r\nappear in that capital, before a friend who happened to be a\r\ndiplomatist. I recollected the engaging aspect in which I had offered\r\nmyself to the reflections of the Rhine when last beside that romantic\r\nstream--a comely youth, with Stultz's best waistcoats on his bosom and\r\nwith ineffable sorrows in his heart. Frau Himmelauen used to say, at\r\nHeidelberg, that my gloves were a shade too light for a strictly\r\nvirtuous man. The Frau has gone to her account, and Stultz, the great\r\nStultz, is defunct too, after achieving for himself a baronetcy as the\r\nprize of his peerless scissors, and founding a hospital here in\r\nCarlsruhe. Not to insult the shade of Stultz, I determined to renew my\r\nyouth, at least in the matter of plumage. A shop of ready-made clothing\r\nafforded me lavender gloves, silk pocket handkerchief, satin cravat,\r\ndetachable collar and a cambric shirt: the American dickey, in which\r\nsome of my early sartorial triumphs were effected, is not to be had in\r\nRhineland. My ornaments purchased, the trouble was--to change my shirt.\r\nThe great hotel, the Erbprinz, was no place for a man without a passport\r\nand without baggage: not for the world would I have faced a hotel-clerk\r\nwith his accusing register. Yet the street was not to be thought of:\r\nonly cats are allowed by etiquette to freshen their linen on the\r\ndoorstep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUSPICIOUS BAGGAGE]\r\n\r\nA resource occurred to me. In ransacking the city for my ornaments I\r\nhad observed the castle-park, with its clumps of verdure and almost\r\ndeserted walks. Hurrah for the leafy dressing-room!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARLSRUHE: THE GRAND-DUCAL PARK.]\r\n\r\nAt the gate a sentinel stopped me. Would he demand my passport? No: he\r\ntaps with his finger the lid of that faithful botany-box, my sole\r\nvalise. Aware that it contained nothing contraband, I opened it\r\ninnocently and demonstratively. At the sight of that resonant cavity,\r\ngaping from ear to ear and belching forth gloves, kerchiefs and minor\r\nhaberdashery, the dragon laughed: his mirth took the form of a deep,\r\nguttural, honest German guffaw. He still, however, rapped sonorously on\r\nmy box, shaking his head from side to side like a china mandarin. In his\r\nview my box was luggage, and luggage is not permitted in any European\r\npark. Relieved to find that my detention was not more serious, my first\r\nthought was to comply with the conditions of entrance. I begged to leave\r\nmy package in the sentry-box, to be reclaimed at departure. The amiable\r\nCerberus, smiling and nodding, closed his eyes significantly: at this\r\nmoment I recollected that my only motive for entering the park lay in\r\nthat feature of my paraphernalia, and caught it up again, with a gesture\r\nof parental violence, in the very act of depositing it. The sentry,\r\nwatching with increasing delight my evolutions and counter evolutions,\r\nevidently thought me a nimble lunatic, Heaven-sent for the recreation of\r\nhis long watch. He no longer opposed any of my demonstrations, and\r\nfinally, with a hearty chuckle, saw me slink past him into the groves,\r\nwardrobe in hand. Most accommodating of sentinels, why were you not in\r\ncharge of a Paris barrier during the siege?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GENTLE CERBERUS.]\r\n\r\nOnce within the park, I found that my sight had deceived me: the day was\r\nhot, and the public, driven from the sunny walks, were concentrated in\r\nthe shade. Not a bough but sheltered its group of Arcadians. I wended\r\nfrom tree to tree, describing singular zigzags on the sward. The\r\nguardians began to eye me with lively interest. Finally, Fortune having\r\nguided me to a beautiful thicket, a closet curtained with evergreens, I\r\nprepared to use it for my toilet, and relinquished a sleeve of my coat.\r\nAt that moment one of my watchmen suddenly showed himself.\r\n\r\nLooking at him with extreme seriousness, I slowly re-entered my sleeve,\r\nand walked away with unnecessary dignity, giving the guardian my\r\npatronage in the shape of a nod, which he did not return.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EYE OF ARGUS.]\r\n\r\nForbidden the green-room, what if I tried the bathroom? Hastily making\r\nfor the Square of the Obelisk, I took a carriage, engaging it by the\r\nhour, and directing it to the nearest bathing-establishment. The driver\r\nimmediately ran off with me outside the city.\r\n\r\nCarlsruhe is an aristocratic construction, whose princely mansions are\r\nsupposed to be supplied with their own thermal conveniences. The\r\nlocality suggested for my bath proved to be a vast suburban garden,\r\nburied in flowers, with amorous young couples promenading the alleys,\r\nand tables crowned with cylinders of beer, each wadded with its handful\r\nof foam. At the extremity, on a square building, five lofty letters\r\nspelled out the word _Baden_.\r\n\r\nA waiter showed me a handsome bath, decorated with a tub like some Roman\r\nmausoleum. I instructed him as to the temperature of my desired plunge.\r\nHe nodded quietly, and left me. Twenty minutes passed. I thought of my\r\nfriend Sylvester Berkley, of the document I hoped to obtain by his aid,\r\nand, most fondly, of the hour when I could return from Carlsruhe. I\r\nthought of the little group who at Marly were expecting and reproaching\r\nme. Charles now, for the twentieth time, would be brushing my morning\r\nsuit and smoking-cap; Josephine, in the act of whipping a mayonnaise,\r\nwould draw anxiously to the window. The baron, my galling and\r\ndispensable old Hohenfels, would have arrived and scolded. My\r\nhome-circle was like a ring without its jewel, while I, an undenominated\r\nwaif in search of a _visé_, was fluttering through the duchy of Baden.\r\nThirty minutes passed, and the bath-house retained the silence of a\r\nruined monastery, while outside, among the perfumes and shadows of\r\ntwilight, there began to arise strains of admirable harmony. I looked\r\nout of the window. Some lanterns placed among the trees were already\r\nbeginning to assert their light among the shadows of evening. A chorus\r\nof fresh and accurate voices was pouring forth from the garden, the pure\r\nyoung tenors and altos weaving their melodies like network over the\r\nsustained, vibrating, vigorous bass voices. It was the antiphony of the\r\nyouthful promenaders to the drinkers, the diastole of the heart above\r\nthe stomach, the _elisire d'amore_ in rivalry with beer. Amid this scene\r\nI recognized my waiter, illuminated fitfully like some extraordinary\r\nfirefly as he sprang into sight beneath the successive lanterns, and\r\npouring out beer to right and left. To my indignant appeal he turned,\r\nlifting his head, and stood in that attitude, finishing a musical phrase\r\nwhich he was contributing to the chorus. Then he told me that my bath\r\nwas being made ready. The Teutonic placidity of this youth confounded\r\nme. Quite disarmed, I closed the shutter, changed my linen in the dark,\r\nand drew on my gloves over a pair of hands that decidedly needed the\r\ndisguise. The lateness of the hour alarmed me, and I fled down the stair\r\nin three jumps. At the bottom I met my musical waiter, still tranquilly\r\nsinging, and armed with a linen wrapper and a hairbrush.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIER UND BADEN.]\r\n\r\n\"What do I owe?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Is der Herr not going to take his bath?\" asked this most leisurely of\r\nvalets.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well: it will be half a florin, including towels.\"\r\n\r\nI gave him the half-florin, and was getting into my cab, when he came\r\nrambling up.\r\n\r\n\"And the palm-greaser,\" he cried, \"the trinkgeld?\"\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes I was at the offices of the national representative, but\r\nit was now dark, and the porter, without waiting for my question, told\r\nme that the offices were closed and everybody gone to the opera.\r\n\r\n\"The theatre!\" I shouted to my charioteer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EXHAUSTED TRAVELER.]\r\n\r\nThe ticket-seller was asleep in his box, and was much astonished at my\r\napplication for an orchestra-seat. The last act of some obscure German\r\nopera was being shouted in full chorus. At Carlsruhe the theatre opens\r\nat five o'clock, and closes virtuously at half-past eight. There was no\r\nsign of my friend, no indication of a box for members of the diplomatic\r\nbody. I was very hungry, and would willingly have re-entered the\r\nboulevards in search of a supper; but the express-train going toward\r\nParis would start at ten-fifteen, and I could afford to think of nothing\r\nbut my passport. I drove to the national office again, my new costume\r\nquite shipwrecked and foundered in perspiration.\r\n\r\nI was more explicit with the porter this time. I asked if Mr. Sylvester\r\nBerkley had returned from the opera. I was answered by that functionary\r\nthat Mr. Pairkley was living at present in the city of Heidelberg, where\r\nhe was trying a diet of whey for the benefit of his liver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SUNNY GROVE.]\r\n\r\nI became flaccid with despair. I was without a refuge on the habitable\r\nglobe; my slender provision of funds would be exhausted in paying for\r\nthe carriage; I was unable even to seek the friend who for the moment\r\nrepresented to me both country and fortune. The driver, witness of my\r\ndejection and recipient of my history in part, proposed to me a\r\ntemporary refuge in a private hotel on the avenue of Ettlingen, where I\r\nwould find chambers by the day, and a family table. The landlady, he\r\nbelieved, was a Belgian and a widow.\r\n\r\nWe drew up before a small house of neat appearance. I was shown a\r\nchamber, where, no longer dreaming of supper, I fell across a cushion\r\nlike an overthrown statue. I felt as if a good month must have passed\r\nsince I possessed a home.\r\n\r\nI had in pocket about thirty sous. The philosopher was right enough when\r\nhe said, \"Traveling lengthens one's life;\" only he should have added,\r\n\"It shortens one's purse.\"\r\n\r\nOn awakening next morning the linnets and finches communicated through\r\nthe window a pleasanter sentiment. Nature was gay and inspiring on this\r\nlovely May-day. By a perversity quite natural with me, my letter to\r\nBerkley, which it was my first care to write and post, contained but a\r\nslight reflection of my woes. My need of a passport only appeared in a\r\npostscriptum, wherein I begged him to arrange that little affair for me\r\nin some way by correspondence. The bulk of my communication was a eulogy\r\nof May, of youth, of flowers, of birds, all of which were saluting me as\r\nI scribbled from the beautiful little grove outside my casement.\r\nTreating the diplomate as an intimate friend--a caprice of the moment on\r\nmy part--I begged him to go back with me to Marly, promising him the\r\njoys described in old Thomas Randolph's invitation to the country:\r\n\r\n            We'll seek a shade,\r\n    And hear what music's made--\r\n        How Philomel\r\n        Her tale doth tell,\r\n    And how the other birds do fill the choir:\r\n        The thrush and blackbird lend their throats,\r\n        Warbling melodious notes.\r\n    We will all sport _enjoy_, which others but _desire_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS.]\r\n\r\nI engaged to furnish him his regimen of whey, and did not omit to quote\r\nfrom the same poem, apropos of that mild Anacreontic drink, the lines\r\nwhich happen to introduce his name:\r\n\r\n    And drink by stealth\r\n    A cup or two to noble _Barkley's_ health.\r\n\r\n\"The cup,\" I continued, \"shall be at once your toast and your medicine,\r\nand the whey shall be fresh. If you want to make a Tartar of yourself,\r\nand feed on koemiss, I will have the milk fermented.\" To the baron of\r\nHohenfels I wrote with equal gayety, begging him to plant the stakes of\r\nhis tent in my garden until my own nomadic career should be finished. A\r\nthird letter, as my reader may imagine, was directed to the Rue Scribe,\r\nand addressed to the American banker, the beloved of all money-needing\r\ncompatriots--Mr. John Munroe.\r\n\r\nMy letters committed to a domestic, I felt absolutely relieved from\r\ncare. I breathed freely, and recovered all my self-possession. Sing\r\nloud, little birds! it is a comrade who listens to you.\r\n\r\nWith two days, perhaps three, of enforced leisure before me, I undertook\r\nin a singular spirit of deliberation the criticism of my surroundings. I\r\nbegan with my bed-chamber. It contained both a stove and a fireplace.\r\nThe fireplace was like all other fireplaces, but not so the stove. Stark\r\nand straight, rising from floor to ceiling, it was fixed immovably in\r\nthe wall, a pilaster of porcelain. No stove-door interrupted its\r\nenameled shaft: only a register of fretwork for the emission of heat,\r\nand quite dissociated from the cares of fire-building, relieved the\r\nennui of this sybaritic length of polish. It was kindled--and that is\r\nthe special merit of this famous invention--from without, in the\r\ncorridor which borders the line of rooms. If you put the idea to profit,\r\nO overtoasted friends of Flemming, I shall not regret my forced\r\ninspection of Carlsruhe. I would distinguish less honorably that small\r\noblique looking-glass inserted in the bevel of the window-jamb, and\r\ncommon to all the dwellings of Carlsruhe--a handy article, an\r\nentertaining distraction, a discreet but immoral spy, which places at\r\nyour mercy all the mysteries of the public street. This contrivance,\r\nwhich enables you to see the world without being seen, certainly gives\r\nyou a tempting advantage over the untimely caller or the impertinent\r\ncreditor; but it encourages, in my opinion, a habit of vision better\r\nadapted to a sultan's seraglio than to the discreet eyes of Western\r\nfolk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TALE OF BRICKS.]\r\n\r\nThis reflection, by which I satisfied my perhaps exalted moral sense,\r\nwas no sooner made than I found myself peeping to right and to left in\r\nmy double mirror, not without a lively sense of curiosity. At first I\r\nsaw--what Flemming, indeed, was wont to see when he consulted the\r\nFountain of Oblivion--only streets and moss-grown walls and trembling\r\nspires, like those of the great City of the Past, and children playing\r\nin the gardens like reverberations from one's lost youth. Soon a nearer\r\nimage approached. From a troop of blond girls, who dragged after them\r\nlittle chariots resembling baby-wagons, one damsel drew apart, allowing\r\nthe others to pass on. She neared my window. Who is the maiden with the\r\nanachronic baby-cart? She is the milkmaid of the country. Here in\r\nGermany Perrette does not poise her milk upon her head or weigh it in a\r\nbalance, in order to afford by its overthrow a fable to La Fontaine. She\r\ncan dream at her ease as she draws it behind her. My fair-haired\r\nneighbor paused. A tall lad thereupon emerged from the neighboring\r\ntrees, and, replacing Perrette at her wagon, he fitted himself\r\ndexterously into her maiden dream and into the shafts of her equipage.\r\nAs the avenue was deserted for the instant, his arm enlaced her figure,\r\nwith the obvious and commendable purpose of sustaining her in her walk,\r\nand with his lips close to her smiling, rosy ones he contributed a\r\ngentle note to the hymeneal chorus that was twittered from the trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FLY-BRUSH.]\r\n\r\nWho could remain long shut up from such an out-of-doors? Directly I was\r\nin the open air, scenting the fresh breath from the parks. I inspected\r\nthe streets, the factories, the people, the houses. A prolonged and\r\ndeliberate examination of Carlsruhe enables me to assert that it is the\r\nmost easy-going, slow-paced, loitering, temporizing, procrastinating\r\ncapital outside of Dreamland.\r\n\r\nA young workingman was assisting some bricklayers in an extension\r\nadjacent to the foundry of Christofle and Company. I saw him going, with\r\na slow and lounging pace, toward the brick-pile, stopping by the way to\r\nquench his thirst at a hydrant, whose stream was so slender that a good\r\nmany applications of the cup of Diogenes were necessary to allay the\r\nheat concentred in the fellow's thick throat. Arrived finally at the\r\nheap of bricks, the goal of his promenade, he took up precisely six, and\r\nproceeded with a lordly, lounging step to bear them back to the masons.\r\nThen, folding his arms, he watched the imbedding of those bricks in\r\ntheir plaster with a sovereign calm like that of Vitellius eating figs\r\nat the combats of the gladiators. When he consented to take up again his\r\nserene march, it was the turn of the bricklayers to fold their arms. At\r\neach errand he consulted the hydrant, and the builders watched all his\r\nmovements with sympathy and approval.\r\n\r\nI photograph the moving figures in the street with the same simple\r\nfidelity which I have employed to represent the trouble-saving\r\nconveniences of my chamber. Take another hero, equally worthy of Capua.\r\nThe placid personage who assisted me to a bath in my room was as happy a\r\ndullard as my waiter in the _Baden_, and both of them caressed their job\r\nas Narcissus caressed the fountain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KNIGHT OF THE BATH]\r\n\r\nA large cart drew up before the door, containing twelve kegs, thoroughly\r\nbunged. Any stranger would take the load for one of beer, but a tub\r\namong the kegs acted as interpreter. The young man from the baths in the\r\nfirst place saw to his horse. He walked around it: the drive having\r\nheated the animal, he covered it with a cloth, and guaranteed its head\r\nagainst the flies with several plumes of foliage, beneath which Dobbin,\r\nblinded but content, showed only the paralytic flapping of his\r\npendulous, negro-like lips. These indispensable cares despatched, the\r\nyoung man from the baths brought up the tub after a short gossip with\r\nthe kitchen-maid, who was going out to market. He asked her if there\r\nwere a stable attached where he could put up the horse during the taking\r\nof the bath: being answered in the negative, he then, with an almost\r\npainful inconsequence of argument, chucked the girl under the chin. He\r\nnext inquired if she had any soap-fat. At length he consented to lumber\r\nup the steps with one of his little kegs: the tenacity of the bung was\r\nso exemplary that a long time was consumed in getting the advantage\r\nover it, and the water on its part was but tardy in leaping toward the\r\ntub in a series of strangulations. This formula, interrupted by minute\r\nattentions to the horse, had to be repeated twelve times, and the bath,\r\nwhich commenced as a warm bath, received its guest as a cold one. Such\r\nwas the result when to the languor of the individual was added the\r\nnational complication of apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GANYMEDE.]\r\n\r\nThe deliberate spectator--or, if you will, the imprisoned spectator like\r\nmyself, with his artificial leisure--asks himself how long a time was\r\nconsumed by this little country of Baden, by this people so lumpish in\r\nits labor, so restricted in its movements, so friendly to its own ease,\r\nin building its elegant metropolis of mansions and palaces? There is\r\nsomething piquant in learning that the city is the hastiest construction\r\non the continent. It only dates from the year 1715.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARRESTED MOTION.]\r\n\r\nCarlsruhe reminds the American traveler of Washington. In place of the\r\ntortuous plan and picturesque inconvenience of the antique capitals, it\r\noffers a predetermined and courteous radiation of broad streets from the\r\ngrand-ducal palace, much like the fan of avenues that spreads away from\r\nthe Capitol building. Formal as it is, and recent as it is, Carlsruhe\r\naffords as pretty a legend as any fairy-founded city of dimmest\r\nancestry.\r\n\r\nThe margrave Charles of Baden, hunter and warrior, returned from victory\r\nto bathe his soul in the sylvan delights of the chase. One day, as he\r\ncoursed the stag in the Haardt Forest, he lay down with a sudden sense\r\nof fatigue, and fell asleep: an oak tree shadowed him with its broad\r\ncanopies. Dreaming, he saw the green boughs separate, and in the zenith\r\nof the heavens descried a crown blazing with incredible jewels, and\r\ninscribed with letters that he felt rather than spelled: \"This is the\r\nreward of the noble.\" All around the crown, hanging in air like\r\nsculptured cloudwork, spread a splendid city with towers: a noble\r\ncastle, with open portal and stairway inviting his princely feet, stood\r\nat the centre, and the spires of sacred churches still sought, as they\r\nseek on earth, to pierce the unattainable heaven. When he awoke his\r\ncourtiers were around him, for they had searched and found their lord\r\nwhile he slept. He related his dream, and declared his ducal will to\r\nbuild on that very spot a city just as he had seen it, with a splendid\r\npalace for central point, and streets like the spokes of light that\r\nspread from the sinking sun. So he said, and gave his whole soul to\r\nbuilding this graceful capital and developing it with the arts of peace;\r\nfor heretofore he had thought only of war, and had meant to patch up a\r\nseat of government in the little town of Durlach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PIPERS.]\r\n\r\nThe Haardtwald still spreads around Carlsruhe (\"Charles's Rest\") to the\r\neastward, but the bracken and underbrush have given way to beaten roads,\r\nwhich prolong with perfect regularity the fan of streets. An avenue of\r\nthe finest Lombardy poplars in Germany, the trees being from ninety to a\r\nhundred and twenty feet high, extends for two miles to Durlach. Around\r\nthe city spread rich plum and cherry orchards, yielding the \"lucent\r\nsirops\" from which is distilled the famous Kirschwasser.\r\n\r\nThe reputation for drunkenness, in my opinion, has been very erroneously\r\nfastened upon the German population. During my sojourn in Carlsruhe I\r\nhave paid many a visit to the beer-shops, from the petty taverns\r\nfrequented by the poor to the lofty saloons where Ganymedes in white\r\nskirts shuffled with huge tankards through a perfect forest of orange\r\ntrees in tubs; for, worse luck to my morals, I have not seen a single\r\nfrightful example, not one individual balancing dispersedly over his\r\nlegs. In the grand duchy of Baden the debauch is punished by a law of\r\nsomewhat harsh logic, which commits to prison both drunkards and those\r\nwho have furnished the wherewithal to excess. The common people form a\r\nnation of drinkers, not drunkards. The beer-tables are usually placed in\r\nthe open air, with shelter for the patrons in case of bad weather. The\r\nout-door air is almost indispensable to correct the evils which might\r\nproceed from such an artillery of pipes all fired in concert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INCENSE AT THE ALTAR.]\r\n\r\nFor Germany, if not a land of intoxication, is certainly one of\r\nfumigation. The face of a German is composed invariably of the\r\nfollowing features: two eyes, a nose, a mouth, and a pipe. Whichever of\r\nthese features is movable, the pipe at least is a fixture. Fortified by\r\nthis vital organ, he lives, loves and moves.\r\n\r\nEDWARD STRAHAN.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTUMN VOICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Seemeth the chorus that greets the ear\r\n      A dirge for the dying hours,\r\n    That wake no more for the passing year,\r\n      Spring's voices of birds and flowers?\r\n    Or is it a psalm of love upborne\r\n     From this grateful earth of ours?\r\n\r\n    Unfold us the burden of your song,\r\n      Grasshoppers, chirping so\r\n    Tender and sweet the whole day long!\r\n      Is it of joy or woe,\r\n    The music that breathes from each blade of grass\r\n      In undertone deep and low?\r\n\r\n    Vainly I list for a jarring tone,\r\n      All is so blest to me--\r\n    From the cricket that answers, beneath the stone,\r\n      The brown toad hid in the tree,\r\n    To the tiniest insect of them all\r\n      That helps with the harmony.\r\n\r\n    Never a pause in the serenade!\r\n      Like the glory of ripened corn,\r\n    It filleth the air through sunshine and shade;\r\n      And from twilight till peep of morn\r\n    Is a rhythmical pulse in the dreamful night,\r\n      That of satisfied life seems born.\r\n\r\n    As the gold of the summer about us floats,\r\n      Soft melody crowneth the haze\r\n    Of the yellow ether with choral notes\r\n      Through these tuneful autumn days.\r\n    Speak, sphinx of the hearthstone, cricket dear!\r\n      Is the song of sorrow or praise?\r\n\r\n    Of this I am sure, that you bring to me\r\n      Thoughts the sweetest of any I know:\r\n    Of this I am sure, that you sing to me,\r\n      In minor tones tenderly low,\r\n    Of things the dearest that life has brought,\r\n      And dearest that hopes bestow.\r\n\r\nMARY B. DODGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCHES OF EASTERN TRAVEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. BATAVIA.\r\n\r\n\"Batavia, ho! and just ahead at that!\" exclaimed the captain of our\r\ngallant East Indiaman as the entire party of passengers sprang to the\r\nquarter-deck on the first cry of \"Land ahead!\" It was scarcely five\r\no'clock in the morning--not dawn between the tropics--but our impatience\r\ncould brook no delay, and despite impromptu toilettes and yet unswabbed\r\ndecks, with sluices of sea-water threatening us at every turn, we\r\nhastened forward to catch the earliest possible glimpse of the quaint\r\nold city of which we had heard such varied accounts. \"You'll think a\r\ngood part of it was built in Holland three centuries ago,\" said our\r\ncaptain, \"then boxed up, sent across the waters, and dropped down,\r\npell-mell, in the midst of the jungle.\" We all laughed incredulously at\r\nthe time, but remembered his words afterward.\r\n\r\nBatavia, one of the strongholds of Dutch power in the East, occupies the\r\nnorth-western extremity of the island of Java. It is composed of two\r\ndistinct settlements, known, respectively, as the \"Old City\" and the\r\n\"New City.\" The former, built directly on the seaboard, consists mainly\r\nof warehouses; stores and government offices, with a pretty extensive\r\nmingling of native dwellings and bazaars. The business-houses occupied\r\nby Europeans are all built in the old Dutch style of centuries ago, and\r\ntheir venerable appearance is largely augmented by the mould and\r\ndiscoloration of the sea-air; while the _tout ensemble_ presents an\r\nancient and dilapidated aspect strangely at variance with the luxuriant\r\nverdure of the tropical scenery and the brilliant tints of the\r\npicturesque Oriental costumes everywhere visible. The New City is a\r\nterrestrial Paradise, with broad avenues shaded by majestic trees,\r\nspacious parks, and palace-dwellings of indescribable elegance--a quaint\r\ncommingling of city and country, of Oriental luxuriousness with the\r\nHollander's characteristic love of solidity. In truth, the New City is\r\nnot a city at all, but a continuous succession of beautiful villas\r\nembowered in orange groves, and surrounded by palms and banians, upon\r\nwhich climb and clamber flowering vines and creepers innumerable, while\r\nbirds are singing, bees humming and butterflies fluttering their gauzy\r\nwings, utterly regardless of the proprieties of city life.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock we found ourselves in the custom-house, surrounded by\r\nDutch revenue-officers, whose insignia of office seemed to consist of\r\nthe huge bunches of keys with which they were armed. Their stylish\r\nuniforms and fair pale faces were singularly in contrast with the\r\nchocolate-colored skins, naked busts, scarlet girdles and green or\r\nyellow turbans of the crowds of native porters who stood ready to take\r\ncharge of the baggage as fast as it was examined. Having seen our\r\neffects disposed of, we set out for our quarters in the New City,\r\nattended by the Bengalese comprador who was to serve as guide and\r\npurveyor-general during our stay in the island. We were driven in the\r\nneatest of pony palanquins, drawn by horses scarcely larger than\r\nNewfoundland dogs, over smooth, well-shaded roads, amid luxuriant fields\r\nand meadows, and for a good portion of the route by the banks of a\r\nbeautiful canal, all aglow with busy life. Here and there were sampans\r\nand _budgerows_, some loaded with merchandise, and others with\r\npassengers, their light sails spread and pennons gayly flaunting in the\r\nbreeze, while men, women and children, bathing and swimming in the\r\nsmooth waters, sported like fish in their native element, and never\r\ndreamed of the possibility of danger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET IN BATAVIA (THE NEW CITY).]\r\n\r\nAmong the majestic trees that formed natural archways above our heads,\r\nshutting out completely the sun's fervid rays, we noted especially the\r\nbanians and cotton trees, the latter frequently besprinkling our heads\r\nand shoulders with what seemed at first glance a shower of _bonâ fide_\r\nsnow, but on examination proved only the light, fleecy down of\r\nsea-island cotton. Conspicuous among the trees we encountered on that\r\npleasant morning drive was the _Palmier du voyageur_, more generally\r\nknown as the _talipat_ or priestly palm, which was described in a recent\r\nnumber of this magazine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A canal in Batavia]\r\n\r\nOne characteristic feature of Javanese residences is their superb baths.\r\nThe pools are usually of marble or granite, of such huge dimensions that\r\none may float and flounder like fish in a pond, while the superintendent\r\nof the bath keeps in constant play a brace of jets that send their\r\nsparkling spray over the bather's head and shoulders with most\r\nrefreshing results. The water is clear as crystal, and sufficiently cool\r\nfor the relaxed state of the system in a tropical clime. Everybody\r\nbathes three times a day, and one would far sooner dispense with a meal\r\nthan do without either of these stated baths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TALAPAT PALM.]\r\n\r\nThe usual routine of European life in India is to rise at \"gun-fire\"\r\n(five o'clock), go out for an airing in boat or palanquin for two full\r\nhours, bathe and dress at eight, take breakfast at nine, lunch at one,\r\nand siesta from two to four, when everybody retires, and, whether one\r\nwishes to sleep or not, he is secure of interruption, and has the full\r\nbenefit of being _en déshabillé_ for the two most oppressive hours of\r\nthe day. At four the second bath is taken; at five all go out in full\r\ndress in open carriages, and after a rapid drive over some of the public\r\nthoroughfares, the horses are walked slowly up and down the esplanade,\r\nwhere all the fashionable world assemble at this hour to see and be\r\nseen, and exchange passing courtesies or comments. At half-past six \"the\r\ncourse\" is deserted, and brilliantly-lighted dining-rooms are thronged\r\nwith guests eager to test the quality of the rich and varied delicacies\r\nof which an Oriental dinner consists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A \"GAMMELANG,\" OR JAVANESE CONCERT.]\r\n\r\nThis is the principal meal of the day, and, occupying often two or three\r\nhours, it is made not merely an epicurean feast, but also an\r\nintellectual and social banquet. Strong coffee, served in the tiniest of\r\nporcelain cups, follows the guests on their return to the\r\ndrawing-rooms, and music, conversation, reading and company fill up the\r\nhours till midnight, when the third bath is taken immediately before\r\nretiring. This routine is seldom varied, except by the arrival of\r\nstrangers, bent, like our party at Batavia, on sight-seeing. _We_ soon\r\nwearied of the very voluptuousness of this stereo-typed course of\r\nindulgence, and welcomed in preference the fatigues and annoyances of\r\nexploring the thousand objects of interest that were beckoning us onward\r\nto jungle, mountain or sea-coast. Our friends, who were old residents,\r\nshook their heads knowingly, and prophesied sunstroke or jungle fever;\r\nbut we went sight-seeing continually, filled our specimen baskets, and\r\nescaped both fever and sunstroke. The climate of Batavia is, however,\r\nextremely insalubrious for Europeans: a deadly miasma everywhere\r\novershadows its luxuriant groves and lurks among the petals of its\r\nbrightest flowers, rendering absolutely necessary regular habits of\r\nlife. Before the occupation of the New City, when merchants and officers\r\nall resided on the seaboard, in the immediate vicinity of their\r\nbusiness-places, the mortality was fearful, till utter depopulation\r\nseemed to threaten the colony. The inland location of the New City is\r\nmore salubrious, and the extensive grounds that surround each dwelling\r\ngive abundant freedom for ventilation, while the few hours passed by\r\nbusiness or professional gentlemen at their offices--and those the best\r\nhours of the day, from breakfast to luncheon--are not deemed specially\r\ndetrimental to health, even for foreigners. The Malays, Chinese and East\r\nIndians generally reside anywhere with impunity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIEUTENANT OF THE SULTAN'S GUARD.]\r\n\r\nAs our ship would be several weeks in port, discharging and taking in\r\ncargo, we availed ourselves of so fortunate an opportunity to explore\r\nsome of the native settlements in the interior of the island. A Dutch\r\nofficer, long resident in Java, kindly offered his escort, and obtained\r\nfor us such passes and other facilities as were needed. Our first\r\nstopping place was at Bandong, the capital of one of the finest\r\nprovinces of Java. It is under the nominal control of a native prince,\r\nwho bears the title of \"regent,\" holding his office under the government\r\nof Holland, from which he receives, an annuity of about forty thousand\r\ndollars. Among the natives he maintains the state of a grand Oriental\r\nmonarch, and his subjects prostrate themselves in profoundest reverence\r\nbefore him; but both he and his domain are really controlled by half a\r\ndozen resident Hollanders, at the head of whom is the prefect. The\r\npalace of the regent is a massive structure, completely surrounded by\r\nbeautiful gardens; and just beneath the windows where we sat I noticed a\r\npicturesque little lake, about which were sporting joyously at the\r\nevening hour a group of the young maidens of the palace. They were\r\ngraceful and lovely in the careless abandon of their glee, but they no\r\nsooner perceived the white faces of the foreigners looking down at them\r\nthan they fled like frightened doves, hiding themselves in a grove of\r\nbananas, in any single leaf of which one of these dainty demoiselles\r\nmight have clothed herself entire.\r\n\r\nWe found the regent surrounded by crowds of native attendants, among\r\nwhose prostrate forms we wended our way to his presence. He was seated\r\non a raised dais at the upper end of the audience-hall, and received us\r\nwith the courteous dignity of a well-bred gentleman. His dress was that\r\nordinarily worn by Malayan rajahs--brocade silk _saráng_ fastened by a\r\nrich girdle, a loose upper garment of fine muslin, and a massive turban\r\nof blue silk wrought in figures of gold. Costly but clumsy Arabic\r\nsandals, and a diamond-hilted _kris_ or dagger of fabulous value,\r\ncompleted a costume that looked both graceful and comfortable for a warm\r\nclimate. He greeted the ladies of our party with marked _empressement_,\r\nthanked them for their visit, and conducted them in person to the\r\nentrance of the seraglio to make the acquaintance of his wives and\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOLDIER OF THE SULTAN'S GUARD.]\r\n\r\nThe next evening we were all invited to be present at the _gammeláng_,\r\nor orchestral and dramatic entertainment, in the harem of this prince.\r\nThe invitation was gladly accepted, and so novel an exhibition I have\r\nseldom witnessed. Many of the musicians were masked, and wore\r\nqueer-looking, conical caps that looked like exaggerated extinguishers,\r\nand a sort of light armor in which their unaccustomed limbs were\r\nevidently ill at ease. Occupying a conspicuous position in the very\r\nfront, I noticed a Siamese _raknát_-player, robed in the native\r\ndress--or rather _un_dress--of his country, and his hair cut _à la_\r\nBangkok. He was singularly expert in the use of his instrument; and I\r\nlearned afterward that, though taken to Java as a slave, his great\r\nmusical talents had won for him not only liberty, but the highest favor\r\nof the regent of Bandong. He was the only rahnát-player in the\r\ngammeláng, but there were some two hundred timbrels, half a dozen drums,\r\nten or twelve tom-toms, twenty violins, sixteen pairs of cymbals, and\r\nany imaginable number of horns, flutes and flageolets. I leave the\r\nreader to imagine the amount of noise produced by such a combination: my\r\nears did not cease tingling for a week. But everybody praised the music,\r\nand evidently enjoyed the fun. The dancing was like all Oriental\r\ndancing, very voluptuous and enthusiastic, adapted especially to display\r\nthe exquisite charms of the performers and move the passions of the\r\naudience. The play that followed possessed no merit, except in the\r\nbewildering beauty of the girlish actresses, and their superb adornments\r\nof natural flowers artistically arranged in coronets and wreaths, with\r\ncostly pearls and diamonds. The play itself was simply a farce--a series\r\nof ridiculous passages between some lovesick swains and their rather\r\ntantalizing lady-loves, who eventually escaped, amid a shower of roses\r\nand bon-bons, from their pursuers, and disappeared behind a huge palm\r\ntree, which the next instant had vanished into air, roots, branches and\r\nall.\r\n\r\nAfter a somewhat adventurous ascent of Mount Tan-kon-bau-pra-hou, a\r\nhurried visit to the volcanoes of Merbabou and Derapi (the former nine\r\nthousand feet high, the latter eight thousand five hundred), and a\r\nglimpse at the sacred woods of Wah-Wons, we turned our faces toward\r\nSourakarta and Djokjokarta, the two grand principalities of Java still\r\nremaining under native rule. Each is governed by an independent sultan,\r\nwhom the Dutch have never been able to subjugate; and they are allowed,\r\nonly by sufferance, to keep a diplomatic agent or \"resident\" at the\r\ncourts of these monarchs. We had been forewarned, ere setting out on our\r\ntour, of the state maintained by these proud Oriental princes, and the\r\nutter impossibility of obtaining an audience without fulfilling to the\r\nvery letter all the requirements of courtly usage. So we had sent\r\nforward some costly presents to each of the sultans, with letters\r\nwritten in Arabic and French, praying for the honor of an interview. Our\r\nmessenger to the court of Sourakarta soon returned, accompanied by a\r\nnative officer and five soldiers in full uniform, with a courteous\r\nletter of welcome from the sultan to his capital. He did not say to his\r\n_court_, and we were left in doubt as to whether we should see him,\r\nafter all. But the day of our entrée was a most propitious one, as on\r\nthat very morning this renowned monarch had been made the happy father\r\nof his twenty-eighth child. To this fortunate event we doubtless owed\r\nour reception at the court of this very exclusive potentate, who, we\r\nwere told, almost invariably declined the proffered civilities of\r\nforeigners. Bonfires, illuminations and processions seemed the order of\r\nthe day, business was suspended, bells were ringing, gongs sounding, and\r\neverybody was taking holiday, in commemoration of an event that seemed\r\nto have lost none of its novelty even after nearly a score and a half of\r\nrepetitions.\r\n\r\nThe palace is built in pagoda form, with abundant architectural\r\nadornments, and is surrounded by a semicircle of smaller buildings of\r\nmuch the same appearance, though somewhat less imposing. The grandest\r\nview is at night, when the whole immense pile, from base to turret, is\r\none blaze of light that but for the abundant tropical growth might be\r\nseen for miles away. The sultan is a well-informed and courtly\r\ngentleman, with a polish of mind and manners we were quite unprepared to\r\nfind hidden away in the heart of Java. He is said to be the most\r\ndistinguished of all the Malayan princes of this isle. He conversed with\r\nreadiness on the general aspect of political affairs in Europe and\r\nAmerica, inquired for the latest intelligence, and before we left\r\ninvited us to be present at a grand military review on the following\r\nday. The garb of the troops, both officers and men, consists of long\r\nsilken sarángs confined by embroidered girdles, gold or silver _bangles_\r\nin lieu of boots, and costly turbans adorned with precious stones--a\r\ngarb that looked; better suited to the harem than the battle-field but\r\ntheir manoeuvres certainly did credit to their royal instructor in\r\nmilitary tactics. The distinguishing weapon of Malayan soldiers, both in\r\nJava and elsewhere, is the kris, worn at the back and passed into the\r\ngirdle. This is always carried both by officers and men, and very\r\nfrequently civilians: the long sword is worn only by officers.\r\n\r\nAfter the review we were presented to the sultan's eldest son, a tall\r\nslender young man, somewhat over twenty, with fierce, gleaming black\r\neyes, and a profusion of black hair falling below his shoulders. His\r\ncountenance indicated both intelligence and firmness, and his appearance\r\nmight have been _distingué_ but for his strangely effeminate dress of\r\ndamask silk made like a girl's, his anklets and bracelets, gold chains\r\nand jeweled girdle, and a mitre-shaped _coiffure_ of black and gold\r\nstudded with enormous diamonds, any one of which would make the fortune\r\nof a Pall-Mall pawnbroker. A score of attendants about his own age were\r\nstanding at the back of the young heir, while four diminutive dwarfs\r\nand four jesters in comic garb crouched at his feet, and innumerable\r\nother subordinates--such as the fan-holder, the handkerchief-holder, the\r\ntea- and bouquet-holders, etc. etc.--made up the retinue of this\r\nyouthful dignitary. At a subsequent interview the _sonsouhounan_\r\npresented me to his mother and several other ladies of the royal harem.\r\nThe sultan was first married at the age of twelve, and had at the time\r\nof our visit forty-eight wives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ELDEST SON OF THE SULTAN OF SOURAKARTA.]\r\n\r\nThere is very much to interest the tourist in this Javanese city, so\r\nunlike the Anglo-Oriental settlements one meets elsewhere in the East,\r\nnor does he soon weary of its noble sultan and splendid Oriental court;\r\nbut time forbade our tarrying longer than the third day, after which we\r\npressed onward to the neighboring principality of Djokjokarta. This is\r\nthe name most conspicuous in Javanese history, since there, from 1825 to\r\n1830, floated victoriously the colors of the revolt, and victory was\r\npurchased at last only by the blood of fifteen thousand soldiers, of\r\nwhom eight thousand were Europeans, and Djokjokarta remained as it was\r\nbefore, an independent sovereignty. The sultan, who belongs to an\r\nancient family, is fine-looking, with a somewhat martial air, and a\r\nnative dignity evidently the heritage of high birth. On our first\r\ninterview he wore above the ordinary silk saráng a tight-fitting jacket\r\nof French broadcloth (blue), richly embroidered and trimmed with gold\r\nlace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SULTAN OF DJOKJOKARTA.]\r\n\r\nHe displayed also a collection of crosses, stars, and other decorations\r\nconferred by various European powers, the French predominating. He had\r\nevidently a partiality for _la belle France_, and exhibited with no\r\nlittle pride an album containing photographs of Louis Philippe and Louis\r\nNapoleon. He conversed well in several languages, readily using either\r\nArabic or French in lieu of his vernacular, and was evidently up to time\r\nin regard to the current political topics of the day. He introduced the\r\nladies of our party to his young and beautiful sultana, and invited them\r\nto accompany her to the inner apartments of the harem. We found the\r\nprivate apartments of the seraglio, like so many others I visited all\r\nover the East, superbly magnificent in the display of gold and jewels,\r\nin costly carpets and exquisite hangings, in the most lavish exhibition\r\nof pictures, mirrors, statuettes and bijouterie generally. There were\r\nglowing tints and warm, rich colors, but all was sensuous: wealth and\r\nsplendor were everywhere visible, but neither modesty nor true womanly\r\nrefinement.\r\n\r\nThe sultan afterward entertained us by the exhibition of a curious\r\ncollection of monkeys and apes. Some were of huge proportions, full four\r\nfeet in height, and looking as fierce as if just captured from their\r\nnative jungles, while the tiny marmosets were scarcely eight inches\r\nlong. The orang-outangs and long-armed apes had been trained to go\r\nthrough a variety of military exercises; and when one of us expressed\r\nsurprise at their seeming intelligence, the sultan said gravely, \"They\r\nare as really _men_ as you and I, and have the power of speech if _they\r\nchose to exercise it_. They do not talk, because they are unwilling to\r\nwork and be made slaves of.\" This strange theory is generally believed\r\nby the Malays, in whose language _orang-outang_ is simply \"_man_ of the\r\nwoods.\"\r\n\r\nFANNIE R. FEUDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON BALLS\r\n\r\nBY A LONDONER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow London balls came to be what, in this latter half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, they are--by what process of development or natural or\r\nartificial selection they acquired their present characteristics, and\r\nwhere and when their congregation of frequenters picked up their current\r\nritual--are matters which I, for one, am content to leave to the\r\nDryasdusts of social history. The existing phase of the subject affords\r\nphenomena enough and to spare to gossip about, without delving into the\r\nrubbish-heaps of the past.\r\n\r\nWell, of course there are different sorts of London balls, and\r\nindifferent sorts, too, for that matter. It would be a hopeless and\r\nendless task to try to classify their various species accurately; and\r\nthis paper isn't meant for scientific readers, who are hereby solemnly\r\nwarned off frivolous ground; so let us just mark out the field into\r\nthree broad divisions--the Public, the Semi-Public and the Private\r\nBall--and take a look at each successively.\r\n\r\nAbout the public ball I do not intend to say much. Take the whole year\r\nround, it perhaps gets together the biggest crowds, merely from the fact\r\nof its affecting the biggest dancing-areas; but as anybody who wants to\r\nrealize it has at most only to spend the handful of dollars requisite\r\nfor a journey to London and a ticket of admission, it hasn't anything\r\nbut the charm of mere geographical inaccessibility to recommend it. But\r\nif you must make acquaintance with the London variety of the public\r\nball, you will hardly find a better place for studying it than St.\r\nJames's Hall, that big, many-mouthed structure between Regent street and\r\nPiccadilly, which with impartial alacrity, provided the hire is paid,\r\nopens its doors to every sort of gathering--its platform occupied one\r\nnight by Joachim and Hallé, the next by Jolly Nash or the Christy\r\nMinstrels; on Wednesday, maybe, by a knot of Total Abstinence\r\nenthusiasts, denouncing publicans as sinners; and on Thursday by the\r\nband to which Licensed Victualers and their friends are dancing at their\r\nannual public ball. You really want to go in? Very well. Gentlemen's\r\ntickets, one guinea; ladies', twenty-five per cent. less--a supposed\r\ninducement to the sordid, money-grubbing male relative or friend who has\r\nthe purse to bring them. Are the prices expressed to be inclusive of\r\nwine? If they are, you will be poisoned with some frothy compound of\r\nwhite _ordinaire_ and chemicals--a truly \"excellent substitute\" for\r\nchampagne--with which ingenious Cette supplies refreshment contractors\r\n(and, alas! others) in inexhaustible abundance. If not, you will have to\r\ndisburse a sixpence every time a partner accepts your offer of a glass\r\nof claret-cup between the dances, and half a sovereign for your bottle\r\nof indifferent \"fizz\" at supper-time. This latter is about the very\r\nworst of conceivable arrangements: it is an improper and aggravating tax\r\nupon the man, who, as likely as not, has not bethought him of bringing\r\nthe requisite pocketful of change; while the ladies--at any rate, all\r\nthe best of them--naturally hate the idea of letting stranger partners\r\npay for them, and often decline refreshments all the evening in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nBut now for the company. Mark the splendor of the gentlemen--the\r\nglossiness of their hair, the velvet collars of their dress-coats, the\r\nsnowy amplitude of their wristbands, the shininess of their\r\npatent-leather boots or steel-buckled shoes. They don't don this kind of\r\ngear every evening, like your _blasé_ Belgravian; so it is surely meet\r\nand right that the get-up should be more elaborate and brilliant than\r\nhis when the festive occasions do come round. The aspect of the ladies,\r\ngallantry and an imperfect acquaintance with the language of millinery\r\nforbid one to criticise. Enough to say that they harmonize perfectly\r\nwith the gentlemen. The music is generally pretty good on these public\r\noccasions, but apt to be over-brazen. It is often a military band. And\r\nto organize the dancers--not always an easy task in a crowded hall--and\r\nsee that the business of introductions goes on duly, a small staff of\r\nenergetic professional gentlemen, styled M.C.'s (which in London, you\r\nknow, stands for Master of the Ceremonies), flit ever hither and thither\r\namongst the throng, now catching a wildly errant waltzing couple in\r\npolitely resolute arms and sending them back into the regular ring, now\r\ngetting up sets for Lancers and quadrilles, and at all points doing\r\ntheir best to keep the ball a-rolling. Useful members of society, these\r\nM.C.'s--a congenial profession for retired Harlequins and--what is\r\npretty much the same thing--dancing-masters. And it is their influence,\r\nmaybe, in some measure that is accountable for the extraordinary variety\r\nof dances that is apt to be found in the programme of the public ball.\r\nMazurka, Schottische, Varsoviana, La Tempête and other curiosities of\r\nthe art Terpsichorean flourish and abound there, to the distraction of\r\nfolk who are not fresh from a dancing academy. Away go our friends,\r\nthough, with happy audacity, whether they're certain of the step or not.\r\nIf in doubt, make a waltz of it, is the golden rule; and you can't be\r\nwrong in twisting your partner half a dozen times _in loco_ whenever you\r\nseem to have a few bars to spare in a quadrille.\r\n\r\nBut we have lingered full long enough at the public ball, though indeed\r\nit is quite the correct thing, you know, to go early and stay late at\r\nsuch, and get one's money's worth for one's money. Jump into a swift\r\nimaginary hansom, and pass on without more delay to what I have ventured\r\nto call, in default of a better name, the semi-public ball. The term\r\nwill perhaps serve as well as any other to cover all those balls which,\r\nthough nominally private, are given so much as a matter of course, and\r\non such a large scale, that they tend to exhibit some characteristics of\r\nthe public ball, and also those which are got up by subscription amongst\r\nthe members of some semi-public body, such as a volunteer corps. The\r\nlady mayoress's annual balls at the Mansion House, and those of the\r\nDevil's Own (the Inns of Court Rifle Volunteers) in the Temple or\r\nLincoln's Inn, may stand as typical samples of the species semi-public.\r\n\r\nNote those words \"Full Dress\" in the corner of your card of invitation\r\nto the Mansion House ball. They mean that if you are the possessor of\r\nanything in the nature of a uniform--military, naval, diplomatic,\r\nconsular, or what not--you are expected to appear in it. But, in any\r\ncase, do not omit to put your card in your pocket, for it will be\r\ndemanded at the door--a not unreasonable precaution against the influx\r\nof uninvited guests in such a crowd. And start Cityward betimes, not\r\nlater than 10 or a quarter-past 10 P. M., if your home lies in\r\nBelgravian or Mayfair parts, for it's a terribly long journey to that\r\nspot where the Mansion House stands staring at the Bank, and City dances\r\nalways begin early. Come, now, isn't it something worth living for to\r\nhave one's coat and hat taken by one of this knot of magnificent\r\ncrimson-velvet-coated, gold-beplastered, silken-calved beings who are\r\nranged along the sides of the vestibule? For my part, I protest that,\r\nfamiliar though their aspect is to me, I cannot see a lord mayor's\r\nflunkeys in their state liveries--their hues varying chameleon-wise from\r\nyear to year--without feelings of almost reverential wonderment. What a\r\nstudy for the great clothes-philosopher of _Sartor Resartus!_ But it\r\nwill never do to stand moralizing in the gangway here. Besides, a superb\r\nmajordomo has caught up our names and announced them electrifyingly; so\r\nhurry we forward to where, between two pillars, the lord mayor,\r\ndistinguished by his chain of office, and the lady mayoress, stand to\r\nreceive their guests with bow and hand-shaking, and on, past them, into\r\nthe scene of action, the Egyptian Hall. A fine big room for a dance, now\r\nthat all those chairs and tables are cleared away that groan so\r\nfrequently under aldermanic bodies and things edible and potable (for\r\nthis hall is, as everybody knows, the home and centre of civic\r\nhospitality). The platform, see, is occupied by the band of the\r\nGrenadier Guards, so the music is sure to be, from a dancer's point of\r\nview, pretty good. Though, in truth, at present one might wonder where\r\nthe dancers are to find space for their gyrations. The whole area of the\r\nfloor is covered by a gay crowd, all chattering away in a very Babel of\r\ntongues. Some royal highness or other is expected to-night, it seems,\r\nand it isn't etiquette to begin dancing before he or she arrives. But a\r\nfew minutes may well be spent in a quick survey of the assembled guests.\r\nAll peoples, nations and languages appear to be represented in the\r\ncrowd. Nawabs and other Indian dignitaries of unpronounceable names and\r\nindefinite rank, in gorgeous, many-colored raiment (presumably their\r\nnational idea of evening full dress), culminating in jeweled caps and\r\nterminating in the opposite direction, somewhat incongruously, in\r\nLondon-made dress-boots; envoys from Burmah or the khanates, appareled\r\nin a kind of bedgowns; diplomates from all the embassies and ministries,\r\nin uniforms of all sorts and colors, the amount of stars, orders and\r\nsuchlike decorations on each illustrious chest being usually in the\r\ninverse ratio of the real importance of the country to which the wearer\r\nbelongs; gallant generals in scarlet and gallant admirals in blue; and\r\ngallant militia officers and deputy lieutenants just as scarlet and\r\nblue, ay, and golden too, as anybody; and all these encircled and\r\nenwrapped by billowy masses of tulle and gauze and silk and satin in\r\nwhich the ladies have come forth conquering and to conquer.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile H.R.H. has arrived, and first-quadrille sets forming in every\r\ndirection speedily drive the non-dancers into the background. Those who\r\nmean dancing have turned the preliminary twenty minutes' waiting to\r\nuseful account by getting their ball-programmes duly penciled with\r\nengagements. In doing this one little difficulty peculiar to such places\r\nas the Mansion House has to be met. The hall is so vast and the\r\nmultitude so bewildering that, unless you know exactly where to look, it\r\nis as hopeless to expect to find any given partner at the right moment\r\nas to seek a needle in a haystack. The only safe expedient is to agree\r\nupon a pillar. A row of substantial pillars runs down either side of the\r\nhall, the base of each fringed with seats, apt head-quarters for\r\nchaperons, who, sitting there at ease, survey the fray and note their\r\ncharges' movements in it. So, as soon as an introduction is over, and\r\nthe engagement noted on the cards, \"Where will you be?\" asks the old\r\nhand. \"Oh, mamma's by the second pillar from the dais;\" and thereupon he\r\nand she go their ways, confident of meeting when their dance's turn is\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nHave you ever gone a-skating on the Serpentine after a fall of snow?\r\nHere and there a more or less circular space has been swept clear, and\r\non each space a batch of skaters whirl and attitudinize, the uncleared\r\ninterspaces of snow-covered, impracticable ice given up to miscellaneous\r\nloafers. Even so it is with the wide area of the Egyptian Hall when the\r\nball is in full swing. The waltzers clear four or five ever-shifting\r\nrings for themselves, in each of which a dozen to twenty couples go\r\nround and round, colliding, jostling and (righteously enough)\r\neliminating the vagrant do-nothings who in aimless perambulation are for\r\never trenching upon the dancers' ground. For which reprehensible\r\nproceeding, mind, there is positively no excuse at the Mansion House,\r\nwhere the range of drawing-rooms and vestibule is ample enough to\r\naccommodate without difficulty the largest numbers that ever come\r\ntogether there. There is always the Long Parlor, too, to resort to,\r\nwhere, at about the longest buffet to be found in Christendom, an army\r\nof waiters are assiduous all the evening through in dispensing tea,\r\ncoffee, ices, cakes, claret- and champagne-cups, fruit, and suchlike\r\nlight refections to all comers. Pretty well thronged the parlor is, too,\r\nin the intervals between the dances, until between midnight and 1 A. M.,\r\nwhen it begins to be comparatively deserted. The reason? Follow that\r\ncouple hurrying to a far corner of the vestibule, and you will soon see\r\nthe reason. Up a flight of stairs we follow to the first floor, to find\r\nourselves at the end of a long _queue_ of couples, all patiently waiting\r\nwith faces turned toward a doorway barred by two authoritative footmen.\r\nInside that doorway is--Supper, a word of substantial import to the\r\ngenuine London citizen; and it is with a keen practical appreciation of\r\nits meaning that these good folk are gathered here, content to wait\r\ntheir turn till those guardians of the doorway, letting down the barrier\r\nof their arms, shall permit them to pass into the supper-room. Truly an\r\ninstructive and elevating sight! Still, people who dance, and still more\r\ndevoted matrons who chaperon, need and deserve to be fed, and when one\r\ncomes to deal with six or seven hundred feeders, it is perhaps necessary\r\nto be somewhat methodical and systematic about it; so possibly the\r\n_queue_ is inevitable, and not greatly to be sneered at.\r\n\r\nThe scene inside the supper-room may be dismissed with a very few words.\r\nNarrowish tables, with a background of waiters, line all four sides,\r\nleaving the centre space for the guests. No seats: every couple occupy\r\nthe first open standing room they can find at a table, and sup on\r\nwhatever viands happen to be opposite them. Maybe there is a certain\r\nstony sameness about the food, a harping _ad infinitum_ on some eight or\r\nten hackneyed culinary ideas which one always finds where, as here, food\r\nand drink for a great many relays of people are provided by contract;\r\nbut so long as chicken and jelly and fairly wholesome wine, with plenty\r\nof that best of antidotal safeguards, seltzer, are obtainable, folk are\r\nnot apt to be hypercritical on such occasions.\r\n\r\nAnother staircase leads down again to the vestibule and hall, where the\r\ncrowd is by this time perceptibly thinning. Chaperons are sailing off\r\nto the cloak-room, each followed by her brood; and the hoarse voices of\r\nthe servants and policemen outside--\"Call Mrs. Thingummy's carriage,\"\r\n\"Mrs. Whatshername's carriage stops the way\"--penetrate almost to the\r\ndancers' ears. Let us get our coats and hats and be off. There is an\r\nalmost amusing coolness in that open display of a saucer for the receipt\r\nof tips on the counter at which the coats are applied for. It\r\nprosaically recalls one to the fact that these magnificent flunkeys are\r\nafter all but human, and not above a regard for shillings. Next Tuesday,\r\nmind, you must not fail to drop in for a few minutes at the lady\r\nmayoress's afternoon \"at home,\" in acknowledgment of your (I trust)\r\npleasant evening at the dance; and be sure you write your name and\r\naddress in the callers' book on the table near the entrance door, if you\r\nwish to be remembered when the cards of invitation for the next dance\r\nare going out.\r\n\r\nTurn we now to a quite different phase of the ball semi-public. The Inns\r\nof Court Rifle Volunteers--familiarly styled (as I have said) The\r\nDevil's Own--are giving a dance in the fine newly-rebuilt hall of the\r\nInner Temple; which, by the way, stands on the very site where in past\r\ndays the Knights Templars used to laugh and quaff. It is a strictly\r\nprofessional corps, this of the Inns of Court. Not only every officer,\r\nbut every man of the rank and file, is either actually a barrister, or\r\nat any rate a student-member of one of the four old Inns, on his way, by\r\nmeans of eating thirty-six dinners in term-time and passing an\r\nexamination, to achieve his \"call\" to the Bar. Still, overladen though\r\nthey be with briefs and business--as of course everybody knows all\r\nLondon barristers are--the Devil's Own manage somehow to find time to\r\nattain a passable proficiency in drill and rifle practice, and not a few\r\nof them in waltzing too. So the corps determine to get up a dance.\r\nPrompted by their festive and hospitable feelings? Oh, of course; that\r\nis to say, partly, and partly, at least the moving spirits in the\r\naffair, with a shrewdish eye to business. For, behold! it is rumored\r\none summer's day through the Inns that a ball is projected; ay, and such\r\na ball! so well managed, so brilliant, so in every way desirable as has\r\nnever been known before. Every barrister, every student must be there.\r\nBUT--and this is an all-important \"but\"--it is at the same time to be\r\nunderstood that tickets will be issued to _members of the corps only_,\r\nand that members of the Inns of Court who are _not_ also members of the\r\ncorps will be specially and particularly inadmissible. Observe the moral\r\npressure thus brought to bear. Brown, Jones and Robinson have hitherto\r\nwithstood all the persuasive recruiting efforts of their friends in the\r\ncorps, but this dance turns the scale. They have sisters of their own\r\nwho beg and demand and insist upon their procuring tickets, and they\r\nknow sisters of their friends who are sure to be there, and whom they\r\nfeel ready to give any price to meet; so the long and short of it is\r\nthat they go off to the orderly-room and qualify themselves for tickets\r\nby taking the oath and becoming enrolled members of the corps. Whereat\r\nthose moving spirits in the affair wink their shrewd eyes gleefully.\r\nThey will dance all the more heartily, remembering the good stroke of\r\nbusiness they have done in the interest of the corps and its recruiting.\r\n\r\nThe ball committee and their workmen have been hard at the work of\r\npreparation till the last minute, and now it is half-past 10 P. M., and\r\ncarriages are beginning to roll up to the hall with their freights of\r\nfair and--other ones. The staircase and corridor are lined with stately\r\ntropical plants and banks of many-colored flowers. First to the\r\ntea-room, as the stream seems to be flowing in that direction. This\r\nsuite of cozy paneled rooms are the sacred and most private haunts of\r\nthe Benchers, the self-electing governing body of the Inn. How\r\nastonished, not to say shocked, those berobed and bewigged legal\r\nluminaries, in their frames upon the walls, must be to look down upon\r\nthis gay laughing, talking, tea-and-ice-consuming mob of invaders! I\r\nfear no one heeds their possible feelings much to-night, though: there\r\nare far more important matters--searching in the crowd for friends,\r\nengaging partners for dances, introducing and being introduced--to\r\noccupy all one's time and thoughts.\r\n\r\nFrom the dais-end of the hall, where on other days the Benchers' table\r\nstands, you may well take a preliminary survey of the scene of action.\r\nWhat a flood of light those sun-burners in the roof pour down! The\r\nblazoned escutcheons of past and present judges, members of the Inn,\r\nwith which the walls are lined, show off all their colors, and the\r\nstained-glass windows do their best to look illuminated. In the gallery\r\nopposite a band of no less than nine-and-twenty picked men of Coote and\r\nTinney's sit ready to play all the latest dance-music as long as any one\r\nwill stay to dance to it; while all over the smoothly-polished floor the\r\ndancers are somehow evolving a kind of order out of chaos, and sorting\r\nthemselves into pairs and sets for the opening quadrille. The male half\r\nof the gathering is, of course, almost exclusively legal, but there are\r\nno distinctions of legal rank to-night. Learned vice-chancellors,\r\nqueen's counsel, juniors and students fraternize and compete for chats\r\nand dances with the ladies quite promiscuously. The hosts of the\r\nevening, the members of the corps, are distinguished by a small knot of\r\nribbons, the corps colors, in their button-holes; but, for comfort's\r\nsake, uniforms have been tabooed in favor of the ordinary civilian's\r\nblack and white. There is present, however, a military element, after\r\nall. Something like eight hundred guests are assembled here, and no\r\nlittle method is needed to enable such a crowd to move about from room\r\nto room without confusion and blocking-up of doorways and passages. So a\r\ncouple of tall Guardsmen have been providently posted in every doorway,\r\nwho, you will find, allow you readily enough to pass them in one\r\ndirection, but, once passed, politely prohibit your returning on your\r\nsteps, and point you forward on a course which, circling through a suite\r\nof rooms and passages, will bring you round again by another entrance\r\ninto the ball-room. By this simple expedient free circulation to and\r\nfrom the tea-rooms and the supper-tent--a temporary erection stretching\r\nnearly to the Temple church outside--is effectually kept up all the\r\nevening, and much loss of time and temper saved. Note how, in the hall,\r\ntoo, the crowd of dancers are kept, in their own interest, within\r\nbounds. Half a score of the little drummers of the Grenadiers are on\r\nduty there, in all the finery of scarlet, braid and overwhelming\r\nbearskins. These, as soon as the band strikes up a waltz or galop, raise\r\nslender barriers of silken cords at intervals across the hall, cutting\r\nup the whole big area into three or four moderate-sized ones, in each of\r\nwhich a distinct ring may spin round and round, without fear of\r\ncollisions with unexpected errant couples from other quarters of the\r\nhall. Truly the ball committee deserve the credit of having been\r\ningeniously provident of many things; though, to be sure, it is just\r\npart of their legal stock in trade to be so. But the author of that\r\narrangement in the passage-nooks--have you noticed it in your\r\nbetween-dances saunterings?--smooth-hewn pyramids of crystal ice,\r\nembowered in ferns and palms, and lit up from behind by some device\r\nwhich makes them glow a lovely rose-color all over--that man deserves a\r\nprize, I protest, for an inspiration that hardly could be expected from\r\nthe frowsy atmosphere of lawyers' chambers. It will be morning, pale and\r\ngray, before the last volunteers see the last ladies to their carriage,\r\nand betake themselves bedward with ears ringing with half a dozen waltz\r\ntunes, and pleasantly oblivious for the nonce of briefs and work-a-day\r\nbotherations.\r\n\r\nKind, patient reader--I feel the adjectives are justly due to any one\r\nwho has accompanied my roving pen thus far--did you ever watch a\r\nstreet-child eating, say, a jam-tart? The dry corners of pastry are\r\nfirst all nibbled off; gradually the outworks where the jam lies thin\r\nare trenched upon all round; while the toothsome centre is fondly kept\r\nintact for the final morsel. Even so have I been reserving my _bonne\r\nbouche_, the private ball; which in its happiest developments is, to my\r\nthinking, as far superior to the semi-public ball as this latter to the\r\npublic. In its happiest developments, mind; for private balls in London\r\nare as infinitely diverse in character as they are infinitely\r\nmultitudinous in number; and some sorts are (to speak politely)\r\ncomparatively undesirable. So, in deference to the exigencies of time\r\nand space, let us confine our attention to the private dance as it\r\nappears in what is called (or calls itself) \"society.\"\r\n\r\nAnd first, as to the people who give these private balls, or dances, or\r\ndancing-parties (for these two synonyms are very commonly preferred to\r\nthe more pretentious word \"ball\"). They may be roughly classified under\r\nfive heads:\r\n\r\n1st (and foremost). Mothers of marriageable daughters.\r\n\r\n2d. People who for some reason or other--official or social position,\r\nwealth, vanity, or what not--are expected, or think they are expected,\r\nto give balls.\r\n\r\n3d. Good-natured, amusement-loving married folk, with money and without\r\ngrown children.\r\n\r\n4th. Benevolent grandfathers, dowagers and aunts.\r\n\r\n5th. The most unlikely people.\r\n\r\nAnd how, where and when are these various dance-givers' gifts bestowed?\r\nThe \"how\" is the easiest thing possible if the lady about to give the\r\ndance is of established position in society. Her set of friends and\r\nacquaintances is numerous, even to embarrassment. All the people whose\r\ndinners or drums or dances she goes to must of course be asked: a dance\r\nfor a dance is a rule as obligatory as that of \"cutlet for cutlet\" (as a\r\nmatter-of-fact old lady of the world phrased it) is in dinner-giving\r\ncircles. At least as many young ladies as she can do with are sure to be\r\nsupplied by this means; while as for men, there are all the host of\r\nbachelors to resort to who at the beginning of the season have left\r\ntheir visiting-cards at her door, thereby intimating, \"I am in town, and\r\nready to be asked to any entertainment you may happen to get up, and\r\nhere is my address.\" But if our intending hostess is a new-comer in\r\nLondon, and has not yet picked up a sufficiency of town-acquaintances,\r\nor if those whom she has are not altogether the style of folk she wishes\r\nto invite, a different course of procedure has to be adopted. It may be\r\ntaken as an axiom that there are always plenty of people in society who\r\nare ready to go anywhere (within recognized limits) to a ball, provided\r\nthat some lady of acknowledged experience in such matters will stand\r\nsponsor for its probable goodness. So our hostess betakes herself to the\r\nhalf dozen or dozen of her lady friends who are possessed of the most\r\nextended and desirable sets of acquaintances, and, diplomatically\r\ninteresting them in her design, leaves with each of them, for\r\ndistribution at discretion, a little pack of cards of invitation. And\r\nnext day young Jones, coming home to his bachelor lodgings in St.\r\nJames's, find on his table the conventional oblong card:\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Jones_\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Smythe\r\n\r\n    At home,\r\n\r\n    _Tuesday, May 6th, 1873\r\n\r\n    150 Queen's Gate. Dancing._\r\n\r\n    R.S.V.P.\r\n\r\nKnowing that he has not the pleasure of Mrs. Smythe's acquaintance, he\r\nturns to the back of the card, and reading there (just the sort of thing\r\nhe had expected to find) the endorsement, \"With Lady Fitzbattleaxe's\r\ncompliments,\" he at once grasps the situation, and sends off a note to\r\n150 Queen's Gate, to the effect that he has much pleasure in accepting\r\nMrs. Smythe's kind invitation. He feels quite safe. Lady Fitzbattleaxe\r\nand her set, all of whom he knows, will be there; and she wouldn't have\r\nsent the card unless she had reason to know that the thing was going to\r\nbe well done. Unattached bachelors who dance have, in fact, little\r\ndifficulty in getting their fill of dancing in the season if they lay\r\nthemselves out for doing so. A young lady can't, as a rule, be asked\r\nwithout at the same time sending a card to her mother or other chaperon,\r\nwhom the hostess may, from considerations of space or otherwise, not\r\nwant to have; whereas your dancing-man takes up very little room, brings\r\nno one but himself, shifts for himself, and is indeed more or less\r\npositively useful toward promoting the avowed object of the gathering.\r\nAware of this, it is a not uncommon practice with dance-going bachelors\r\nto interrogate a partner whom they feel a wish to meet again as to the\r\n_locales_ of her coming dance-engagements, and thereupon, through the\r\nmedium of some friend of that potent and wonderful class, the\r\nKnow-everybodys, to manage somehow to procure for themselves cards of\r\ninvitation to the houses and parties indicated, whosoever and wherever\r\nthey may be.\r\n\r\nBut now, supposing Lady This or Mrs. That to have made up her mind to\r\ngive a ball, where will she give it? At home, no doubt, in the great\r\nmajority of cases; but if her rooms happen to be small, or she wishes to\r\navoid the nuisance of having her own house turned upside down (as it\r\nmust be for a couple of days at the least if a ball is to be held in\r\nit), she may prefer--I am assuming expense to be no object--to hire some\r\npublic rooms, like Willis's, or an empty house for the occasion; of\r\nwhich alternatives it is ten to one that the latter will be adopted.\r\nTrue it is that the ball-room at Willis's (in old days so well known as\r\nAlmack's), though far too narrow for its length, offers a floor of\r\nsuperlative smoothness, and that its position, in the very heart of the\r\nSt. James's quarter, leaves nothing to be desired; but the place is so\r\ngenerally associated with festivities of the public and semi-public\r\nclasses that anybody giving a private dance there may feel sure that the\r\nguests will not regard it as quite the same sort of thing as a dance in\r\na private house. The empty-house plan is not open to this objection.\r\nOwing its origin, doubtless, to the prodigious amount of house-building\r\nthat has been going on of late in fashionable London, it has become\r\nquite a recognized institution of these last few seasons; and it\r\ncertainly saves the ball-giver a world of trouble. There stand plenty of\r\nnewly-built first-class mansions in Belgravia that have not yet found\r\ntenants, thoroughly finished off, externally and internally, so far as\r\nfloors and doors and windows and staircases go, but of course entirely\r\nunfurnished. One of these is selected and hired (at a cost that would\r\nmake some people gasp) for the determined evening. An upholsterer is\r\nturned in to put up temporary mirrors, chandeliers and curtains, and lay\r\ndown temporary carpets; a florist, following, covers bare mantelpieces\r\nwith captivating layers of cut-roses, ferns and mosses, and empties a\r\nwhole conservatoryful of plants and flowers into halls and passages;\r\nessential Gunter, always equal to any accumulation of occasions, sends\r\nin the conventional foods and drinks, and a competent staff of waiters\r\nto dispense them; from equally essential and omnipresent Coote and\r\nTinney's comes a detachment of competent musicians; and hey, presto! the\r\nempty house bursts into light and life and music, and, exulting in its\r\nCinderella finery, welcomes the guests with all the air of an\r\nestablishment that has been accustomed to this kind of thing for years.\r\n\r\nIt is not always an easy matter to time one's arrival at a private ball\r\nquite satisfactorily. The old hands have of course certain general rules\r\nto go by: for instance, if the invitation-card has borne the words\r\n\"Small and early\" in one corner, that dancing may be expected to begin\r\nby eleven o'clock or thereabouts; but in the absence of any such guide\r\nit is almost impossible to predict with accuracy the time when arrivals\r\nwill set in; and so one oftentimes falls into the Scylla of\r\nover-lateness in anxiety to steer clear of the Charybdis of\r\nover-earliness, or _vice versâ_. I call to mind a ball at the close of\r\nlast season to which I went expressly to meet certain friends, and\r\nthought to have hit off the happy mean by entering the ball-room just\r\ntwenty minutes before midnight; but, lo! the musicians had not yet\r\ntaken possession of their corner, and sofas and chairs were but sparsely\r\noccupied by some couple of dozen specimens of that portion of the fair\r\nsex who in outward seeming not attractive, for dancing purposes, to the\r\nfrivolous male, yet for some inscrutable reason always put in the\r\nearliest appearances in ball-rooms.\r\n\r\nIt is all very well to cry out against dances that don't begin till near\r\nmidnight as absurd and reprehensible; but, after all, their lateness is\r\neasily accounted for. In May and June from six to half-past seven in the\r\nevening are the pleasantest of hours for driving in the Park or\r\nstrolling to see others drive there. Nobody willingly goes home till\r\nthose pleasant hours are over; so no wonder that dinners tend to begin\r\nat a quarter- or even half-past eight; that they consequently are not\r\nover much before eleven; and that people who have, after that, to look\r\nin and gossip for ten minutes at somebody or other's drum, do not find\r\nthemselves at the ultimate evening engagement, the ball, much before the\r\nstroke of twelve. The balls of the London season will not become much\r\nearlier, methinks, until some thorough revolution takes place in the\r\nlikings and habits of the folk who give and go to them.\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, the arrival accurately timed, or, at any rate, any fault\r\non the side of over-earliness corrected by a judicious waste of minutes\r\nin the cloak- and tea-rooms down stairs. At the top of the inevitable\r\nstaircase, or just inside her drawing-room, our hostess stands ready\r\nwith smile and hand-shake for each and every guest announced by the\r\nsonorous butler. Many of the younger men (who have received cards by one\r\nor other of the side-winds above spoken of) she has very likely never\r\nseen or heard of till this moment; but no matter--they and she are\r\nequally equal to the occasion. Perhaps the lady who has sent the\r\nstranger a card \"with her compliments\" hears him announced, and stepping\r\nforward introduces him to the hostess. If not, the hardly formidable\r\nordeal of a polite bow and a hand-shake passes him on into the\r\nball-room, where, once arrived, he looks about for friends, and\r\nproceeds to engage dances, and (let us hope) enjoy them without the\r\nslightest sense of strangeness in the strange house, provided only that\r\nhe has chanced upon a fair sprinkling of his own set there. Who the\r\nmaster of the house may be he probably, if an average careless Gallio,\r\nknows little and cares less. Indeed, _Paterfamilias_ is usually content\r\nto sink his own personality and be a nonentity for the nonce on the\r\nnight of his wife's dancing-party.\r\n\r\nThe suite of drawing-rooms, usually two rooms occupying the whole of the\r\nfirst floor, have been gutted of furniture and stripped of carpets to\r\nform the ball-room. The floor is hardly ever of polished wood in modern\r\nLondon houses, but the boards are smooth, and a very tolerable surface\r\nfor dancing purposes is produceable by the simple process of washing\r\nthem over with milk. Some people, not caring to go to the trouble of\r\nhaving carpets taken up, content themselves with a holland cloth tightly\r\nstretched over the carpeting, which is indeed preferable to that\r\nabomination, a beeswaxed floor, but is, at best, but heavy traveling for\r\nthe dancers, and apt, too, to tear during the evening into dangerous\r\nfoot-ensnaring holes.\r\n\r\nAre you a connoisseur in costumes? The men's dress is, of course, the\r\nsame, in general appearance, all the Western world over, and the only\r\nvarieties in a London ball-room are the better or worse styles of\r\ntailoring and an occasional white waistcoat. Fortunately, the fair sex,\r\nwith all the colors of the rainbow and all the inspirations of the\r\nfashion-books and dressmakers at command, can and do give a\r\nkaleidoscopic plentitude of variety to the scene. _Débutantes_ just\r\n\"come out\" in society are conventionally confined to simple white, but\r\ntheir more experienced sisters may indulge in any combinations of tulle\r\nand other gauzy substance, white or colored, with ribbons, flowers, and\r\nall the materials and devices known to millinery, at discretion; to all\r\nwhich the rich and stately velvets and silks of the chaperoning matrons\r\nform an effective background.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the introductions. There is no getting on at all in a\r\nprivate dance, nor indeed in any London society, without introductions.\r\nSociety rigidly requires of every man that he submit to the process as a\r\npreliminary to addressing even a remark anent the weather to a\r\nlady--much more before asking of her such a favor as a dance. But a man\r\nwho goes much to dances soon grows somewhat wary in this matter. He\r\nlearns to shun the overtures of the seemingly benevolent people--above\r\nall, the master of the house--who proffer willingness to introduce him\r\nto partners; for has not experience taught him that such folk are always\r\nactuated by the desire (laudable enough, perhaps) of procuring partners\r\nfor some lady friend whose personal attractions are not, by themselves,\r\ncalculated to bring them? No, he prefers, the selfish wretch! to seek\r\nand choose for himself--first, to look about and determine to which of\r\nall the strange faces in the room he would wish to be introduced, and\r\nthen to set about finding out means of getting introduced to them.\r\n\r\nIt is a misfortune that the present habits of society, placing the fair\r\nsex in the position of waiting to be asked by would-be male partners, as\r\nwell for dances as for life-partnerships, do not at the same time, in\r\nthe former as they do in the latter case, countenance their meeting\r\nundesired proposals with a direct negative. It is fully admitted in\r\nprinciple, and is said to be experienced in practice, that a lady may\r\nreply to the question, \"Will you marry me?\" with a conclusive \"No.\" But\r\nthe same answer, given to the stock ball-room interrogatory, \"May I have\r\nthe (honor/pleasure) of a dance?\" would be conventionally reprobated as\r\ndiscourteous, and is practically impossible. The natural consequence is,\r\nthat the fair answerer is driven to all manner of distressing--sometimes\r\nalmost amusingly distressing--shifts and equivocations, merely to escape\r\nthe necessity of dancing with men whom she doesn't wish to dance with,\r\nbut who insist on asking her to do so. Sometimes she salves her\r\nconscience by the device of arranging beforehand with a brother or\r\nother near relative that she shall be understood to be engaged to him\r\nfor every and any dance that may be asked for by a person undesired. At\r\nother times she will have mislaid her programme, or \"think mamma will\r\nwant to be gone\" before the proposed dance is reached. To young ladies\r\nthus embarrassed a practice which has recently gained some hold at\r\nprivate balls, of supplying no dance-programmes at all, has afforded a\r\nnovel and most happy relief. For when one man has asked for (and perhaps\r\nfondly noted on his ample cuff) \"the third dance from now,\" another \"the\r\nsecond galop,\" and a third \"the fourth round,\" she is so genuinely\r\nbewildered as to how many and what dances she is and is not engaged for\r\nthat it becomes alike easy to checkmate proposals by the reply\r\n\"engaged,\" and at any time in the course of the evening to give an\r\nimmediate dance to any favored partner, in sheer hopelessness of\r\nremembering to whom, if at all, it has already been promised, and on the\r\nchance that the unknown will not appear to claim it.\r\n\r\nBut suppose, on the other hand, there are programmes. If one could get a\r\nsight of any dozen, taken at random, after all, I warrant there would be\r\nsome curious if not edifying reading there. Names are (unintentionally\r\nenough) so slurred in the hurry of introduction--\"Miss Mumble-mumble,\r\nallow me to introduce Mr. Jumble-jumble\"--that, more often than not,\r\nneither party catches the other's name; and so She, even if she gives up\r\nher programme to be marked with the engagement, probably gets it back\r\njust scrawled with some initials; while He is driven to the expedient of\r\nentering on his programme some brief memorandum of dress or\r\nornament--\"blue and roses,\" \"pearls,\" or the like--which may or may not\r\nserve to recall to him each fair personality in turn. Sisters, though,\r\nare apt to upset this descriptive arrangement by their provoking habit\r\nof going about in identical costumes. Some luckless wight has taken a\r\nsatisfactory note of the dress and general appearance of a Miss\r\nUnknown, and then, horror! half an hour afterward he discovers that\r\nthere are _two_ wearers of such dress in the room, each the very ditto\r\nof the other. There is only one way out of it: when the destined dance\r\narrives he must go boldly up to one of them with the usual \"My dance, I\r\nbelieve?\" For there's, at any rate, an even chance of his being right;\r\nwhile, at worst, if she answers, \"I think not,\" his doubt is at once\r\nsolved in favor of the other sister.\r\n\r\nIn the dances themselves there is not much variety. Society knows of\r\nfour only--two \"squares,\" quadrille and Lancers, and two \"round,\" waltz\r\nand galop. Of these, waltzes are the most, and quadrilles the least,\r\npopular, it being of course understood that \"round\" dances occupy\r\nconsiderably more than half of every programme. Still, \"squares\" are not\r\nlikely ever actually to disappear. There is a certain undeniable utility\r\nabout them. They give breathing-times between waltz and galop; a share\r\nin the amusement of the evening to people who are too old or too\r\nponderous, or otherwise unsuited for the whirling \"rounds;\" and scope\r\nfor that pleasant institution, \"sitting out,\" which, as everybody knows,\r\nconsists in ostensibly engaging a partner for a \"square,\" and then,\r\ninstead of dancing it, deliberately spending the time in a quiet\r\nsit-down chat. \"Dancing it,\" I see I have written, but truly it is only\r\nby courtesy that the word can be applied to a private-ball quadrille, in\r\nwhich nobody dreams of doing steps or attending to time, and the\r\nconventional ideal is reached by a sort of unconcerned-looking saunter,\r\ndistantly suggestive of the formulated movements of the figures. But if\r\nyou can't dance too ill for the \"squares,\" on the other hand you can't\r\ndance too well for the \"rounds,\" especially waltzes. All thorough-going\r\ndancers will now have nothing but the _valse à trois temps_, which\r\nrequires both partners to be exactly in time both with one another and\r\nthe music, and a partner who can only dance the old _deux temps_, or\r\nwhose _trois temps_ step is faulty, is not very likely, if a man, to be\r\nfavored with many \"rounds,\" or if a lady to be asked for them.\r\n\r\nAs for the talk of ball-rooms, its silliness and inanity are almost\r\nproverbial. And yet what else can one expect? In the \"squares\" one's\r\nattention is so constantly called off to some process of bowing, or\r\nsetting, or crossing over, or turning round, that it is next to\r\nimpossible to get half a dozen consecutive sentences of conversation at\r\na time. Indeed, I have often meditated making a fortune by publishing,\r\nfor the use of men whose small talk is limited, a pocket _Dancers\r\nConversation Book_, to consist wholly of three-word beginnings of\r\nsentences, such as \"Don't you think--,\" \"Have you seen--,\" \"Do you\r\nknow--,\" and so on. The reader would be instructed, every time he found\r\nhimself at rest beside his partner, to start one of these fragments,\r\nwith a pleasant smile and an interrogative air, in well-founded\r\nconfidence that by the time the third word was out of his mouth some\r\nexigency of the figure would require him to turn off to some independent\r\nmovement on his own part, which ended, his partner might safely be\r\nassumed to have forgotten all about his last remark, and to be ready to\r\nlisten to another equally illusory. But even supposing a couple have\r\ncomparatively time to talk--as, for instance, during the short interval\r\nbetween two dances--how, if (as must continually happen) they were utter\r\nstrangers to one another till ten minutes ago--how, I say, can they be\r\nexpected to get beyond the veriest outworks and superficialities of\r\nconversation? The man (with whom it lies to take the lead) may possibly\r\nhave a host of interests, and be able to talk sensibly or speciously on\r\na variety of subjects, but at the start he is quite in the dark as to\r\nhis partner's tastes and pursuits, and so almost perforce breaks ground\r\nwith first one, and if that fails another, of the ordinary small-talk\r\nquestions, on the chance of lighting upon some topic that the lady knows\r\nor cares about. There is always a hope of turning up trumps. \"Have you\r\nbeen to the opera lately?\" may discover an ardent musician, and pave\r\nthe way for a long \"sit-out\" gossip on things musical. \"Have you been in\r\ntown long?\" may lead to any amount of pleasantly rambling talk about\r\nplaces and people in the counties, or recollections of continental\r\ntravel, perhaps the most fascinating of all kinds of \"shop.\" Of course,\r\nif the partners are old friends, or even tolerably familiar\r\nacquaintances, the surface-fishing process is happily unnecessary, and\r\nthey can plunge at once into deep waters. Still, even if they get upon\r\nso-called tender subjects, it's long odds they won't have time enough to\r\nget out of their depth. That danger is reserved for the quieter and more\r\nprolonged intercourse of picnic-parties and country-house life. Cupid's\r\narrows seldom penetrate deep at a ball.\r\n\r\nA careful observer of ball-room talk will not fail to notice what may be\r\ncalled the exclusive slang of society. He will find people \"in society\"\r\nhabitually using a few pet words which they love, not because they are a\r\nbit better than the synonyms used by other people, but just because\r\nother people don't use them, whereby they serve as a sort of passwords\r\nor Masonic signs among the initiated. Just now plainness is all the\r\nfashion. Ladies who are not in society talk of \"dresses\" and\r\n\"gentlemen,\" and grammatically contract \"are not\" into \"aren't;\" so the\r\nladies of the Upper Ten say \"gowns\" and \"men\" and \"ain't\" for\r\ndistinction's sake. And the same idea comes out at many points. The\r\npublic-ball cavaliers rejoice in lavender- or lemon-colored kids, and\r\ndisplay exuberant activity in the \"squares;\" so the dancing-man of\r\nsociety punctiliously gloves his hands in white, and strolls through a\r\nquadrille with an air of languid indifference. One romp, and one only,\r\ndoes the private ball countenance in the merry-go-round of the third\r\nfigure of a \"sixteen\" (double) set of Lancers.\r\n\r\nAfter every dance, in the early stage of the ball, there is a general\r\nset of the dancers in the direction of the tea-room. Till some time\r\nbetween midnight and one o'clock the door of the supper room is kept\r\nstrictly closed, and light refreshments--tea, iced coffee, cream- and\r\nwater-ices, various \"cups\" and lemonades and strawberryades, and cakes\r\nand biscuits and such-like--have undisputed possession of the field.\r\nAnything to get away for five minutes from the heated atmosphere of the\r\ndancing-room; so it is generally advisable to propose \"tea\" to your\r\npartner as an excuse for a visit to the back room down stairs (probably\r\nPaterfamilias's study or the children's school-room on other days); and,\r\nonce there, you will ask instructions as to whether \"tea\" shall this\r\ntime take the form of \"cup,\" or something-ade, or ice. Most likely it\r\nwill be the latter, and between \"cream\" and \"water\" [ices] her voice is\r\nalmost sure, despite the certainty of consequential thirst, to be for\r\n\"cream.\" But hardly has the _preux chevalier_ successfully struggled at\r\nthe buffet for the creamy spoonful when harp and horn are heard\r\npreluding to the next dance up stairs, and everybody must hurry back\r\nfrom passage, stairs or tea-room to find or await his or her next\r\npartner.\r\n\r\nWhen the ball is at its fullest is the time for the really first-rate\r\ndancer to turn his talent to the best advantage. Nearly all London\r\nball-givers have such an immense circle of acquaintances that, for some\r\nshorter or longer period of the evening, their parties are pretty sure\r\nto be overcrowded. Soon after midnight, it may be, all the world and his\r\nwife will just have arrived together, and the abomination of suffocation\r\nsets in. The staircase is congested and impassable: the dancing area in\r\nthe ball-room is encroached upon till a space about as big as a\r\ndining-table is all the dancers have to dance in. At which crisis it\r\nwants no little skill and practice in a man to steer his partner deftly\r\nand without collisions through the intricate _mêlée_. It can be done,\r\nthough, to a degree hardly credible till practically tested, the really\r\ngreatest difficulties being, in point of fact, rather to start and stop\r\nthan to avoid bumpings when once fairly underweight; but ladies suffer\r\nsufficiently from dizzy or clumsy partners to make them often, in a\r\ncrowd, prefer to give their \"rounds\" to a man whose steering is good,\r\nrather than to one whose feet are less dexterous than his tongue.\r\n\r\nAt some unperceived moment toward one o'clock couples descending to the\r\nice-room find the dining-room door wide open, the signal that the supper\r\nperiod has commenced. First, one or two make up their minds that the\r\ndiscovery is opportune, and enter shyly in the face of an expectant line\r\nof waiters drawn up behind the buffet. Note the arrangement of the room\r\nwhile there is yet space to grasp its details, for ten minutes hence, be\r\nsure, the place will be so thronged, with such an all-pervading\r\nhurry-scurry going on, that there will be no chance of noting anything.\r\nFacing you as you enter, down the length of one side of the room, runs a\r\nlong buffet-table, the nearer side spread with the apparatus of eating\r\nand drinking, the centre laden with every variety of comestibles,\r\ninterspersed at intervals with tall _épergnes_ and other silver\r\nornaments sacred to all that's aesthetically captivating in fruit and\r\nflower; while in the rear, calm, collected and decorous, stand a row of\r\nmiddle-aged ministering persons from Gunter's. There are no chairs at\r\nthe buffet. If you sup there, you must sup standing--no great hardship,\r\nas the table is of course of a height just convenient for the\r\npurpose--and you can either accept the services of the ministering\r\nperson opposite you, or help yourself from the multitude of dishes\r\nwithin reach. All very well, this, for those who are in a hurry, just\r\nsnatching a morsel between two dances, and for all who see no\r\npracticable opportunity of doing better for their partners and\r\nthemselves. For, an intervening gangway being of course left clear for\r\nfolk to pass up and down to and along the buffet, the rest of the\r\nfloor-space is occupied by three or more (according to the size of the\r\nroom) small round tables, low, chair-surrounded, each laden with a due\r\ncomplement of plates, glasses, victuals, and so on, and each capable of\r\naccommodating three or four couples at a time. To one of these, if you\r\nare wise, and have the luck to espy any vacant chairs, you will\r\nsurely--I am of course addressing my male readers--lead your partner. I\r\nassume that, with an experienced eye to this very thing, you have\r\npurposely contrived to engage one with whom you specially enjoy, or\r\nthink it likely that you will enjoy, a good gossip, for a quadrille that\r\noccurs just at this period of the evening, and that you have suggested\r\n\"sitting out\" the dance in the supper-room; so that you have now\r\ndescended the stairs happy in the consciousness of ten minutes or more\r\nof leisure before the next \"round\" will again demand your indefatigable\r\n_trois temps_ in the ball-room.\r\n\r\nWell, two chairs secured, and partner comfortably seated on one of them,\r\nthe next thing for the man to do, before settling down into\r\nconversation, is to forage at the buffet for supplies; for the stock\r\noriginally placed on the little table is pretty sure to have been\r\neviscerated in the course of the first half hour's attack. He doesn't\r\nask his partner to say what she will have, knowing full well that\r\nladies, young and old, even if so interrogated, are sure to give that\r\ninvariable pair of successive answers, \"chicken\" and \"jelly,\" not\r\nbecause they really prefer those to any other viands--as a matter of\r\nfact, their own inclinations, so far as they are earthly enough to have\r\nany, are generally very much otherwise--but from a modest wish to give\r\nthe least possible trouble; chicken and jelly being stock dishes that\r\nare quite certain to be at hand in every supper-room. No, he is far more\r\nlikely to please by asking to have the matter left in his hands, and\r\nthereupon going off to the buffet, to return with a small but varied\r\ncollection of three or four samples, each on a separate plate, of the\r\nmost novel and attractive of the culinary triumphs there displayed, for\r\nher to choose from. Which duty done, and some champagne and\r\nseltzer-water deftly mixed, he will with a light heart take possession\r\nof his reserved chair, and fall to upon one or other of the unchosen\r\nsamples and the most thoroughly zestful chat of the evening.\r\n\r\nBehooves it to say a word or two of the materials of the typical\r\nball-supper? There is a family likeness about those turned out by\r\nGunter that the experience of one season is enough to make one\r\nrecognize. And, on the whole, the Gunterian supper is as good, in its\r\nway, as; need be. Nothing hot, of course, except oyster soup (specially\r\nadapted for deserving chaperons), and, maybe, some delicately browned\r\ncutlets; but cold meats of every shade of substantiality, from boars'\r\nheads and chickens and raised pies to the most delicate of sandwiches,\r\ntempting translucent aspics, in which larks, lobsters, prawns, fillets\r\nof sole, and such-like lie \"imbedded and injellied,\" and ethereal\r\nplovers' eggs. Of sweets the multitude and variety is almost infinite;\r\nand indeed the possible combinations of things creamy and jammy and\r\ngelatinous are tolerably well known all over the world. Among them fresh\r\nstrawberries combined with plain iced cream may be mentioned as holding\r\na high place in general favor. As to the drinkables, sherry and claret\r\nare always at hand, but the almost universal beverage is a mixture of,\r\nsay, two thirds of champagne to one of seltzer-water. The idea of this\r\nmixture is, no doubt, partly to get rid of that excess of fixed air\r\nwhich is apt to make undiluted champagne a rather uncomfortable material\r\nfor a draught; but the custom is mainly the result of sad experience of\r\nthe unwisdom of doing otherwise, owing (it must be admitted) to the\r\nbadness of the so-called champagne only too commonly dispensed at ball\r\nsuppers. How the man who wouldn't dream of giving his guests a glass of\r\ninferior wine at his dinner-table comes to think nothing of poisoning\r\nthem with the cheap rubbish that audaciously flouts in advertising\r\ncolumns as \"supper-champagne,\" has puzzled sager brains than mine.\r\nSurely, bad wine is not less injurious taken in repeated draughts in the\r\nsmall hours of the morning than it would be sipped in small doses at\r\ndinner-time; yet it's only here and there a logically-minded individual\r\nproduces his dinner-champagne at his wife's dancing-parties; and\r\neverywhere else old and young with equal caution demand a prudent\r\nadmixture of the seltzer that will, if anything can, avert a\r\nnext-morning headache. The chaperon, warrantably hungry, taking her time\r\nover her supper in a comfortable corner, is often not to be tempted by\r\nany sparkling liquid; but the dancers want the nervous exhilaration that\r\nchampagne, however inferior, at least temporarily supplies, and are\r\nrarely careful enough to shun the danger altogether.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going on anywhere?\" is a query that not unfrequently meets\r\none's ears about halfway through the evening. \"Going on\" is an\r\nessentially town practice. In the country, houses lie too far scattered\r\nfor it, and there is seldom such a press of gayeties on foot together as\r\nto make it likely that two or more engagements will have been made for\r\none night. But in London, owing to the limited number of evenings\r\ncomprised in a season, as compared with the host of people who want to\r\ngive their parties in the course of it, it constantly happens that folk\r\nwho go out much find themselves invited to a dinner, a drum and a couple\r\nof dances, all on one and the same evening. Ay, and they manage to\r\nachieve them all, too, thanks to determination and broughams. To the\r\ndinner at eight P. M.; away at a quarter to eleven to put in an\r\nappearance and for ten minutes swell the hurried and promiscuous chatter\r\nat the drum; thence off again to one of the balls--to stay if it is\r\ngood, or if it isn't to go on after a dance or two to the other. The\r\ncustom is so thoroughly recognized that no hostess would ever dream of\r\nbeing offended with any of her guests for \"going on\" elsewhere whenever\r\nthey think fit. Not that she is ever likely to know whether this or that\r\nindividual does or does not do so; for it's not at all necessary before\r\none goes off to say any formal good-night to the hostess, and in fact\r\nmen very seldom do so. When they have had dancing enough, or,\r\nremembering some disagreeable necessity of being up and alert for work\r\nnext morning, feel it's about time to be going bedward, they quietly\r\nslink down stairs to the cloak-room, get hats and wraps, and are off in\r\na fast hansom without a word to anybody. It's all very well for the\r\nyoung lady, who has from day to day no calls upon her time but those of\r\nher own pleasures and engagements, to stay late at any particularly\r\npleasant dance. She may collapse to her heart's content next morning,\r\nand still be ready again by nightfall for another round of excitements;\r\nbut with her partners things are very different, unless, indeed, they\r\nare officers in the Household Brigade. The young barrister or banker, or\r\nwhat not, who is frivolous enough to like combining some nights of\r\ndancing in the season with hard days of work, soon finds that the only\r\nway of gratifying both tastes is to partake sparingly, in point of\r\nhours, of the former one; so he comforts himself with the reflection\r\nthat there are as good balls in the season as ever came out of it, and\r\nresolutely says good-night to the most festive scenes by 2 A. M. at\r\nlatest. By that time, indeed, the best of a private ball is very\r\ncommonly over. No doubt there are delicious and long-to-be-remembered\r\nopportunities now and then seizable by staying later. Strauss'\r\nworld-known \"Blue Danube\" waltz with an appreciative partner, and the\r\nrare luxury of ample dancing-space in an emptying room, is one such. But\r\nwhen the minute-hand of the hall-clock is approaching the third of the\r\nsmall hours, the endurance of the most indulgent and enduring of matrons\r\nis apt to get exhausted, and she carries off her brood, determined, like\r\neverybody else, not to be the last to go. In the tea-room she will get a\r\nstrengthening draught of some clear soup or other in a tea-cup, and\r\nmeanwhile John Thomas will have called the carriage to the door.\r\n\r\nNext morning the _Morning Post_ will serve up to its (mostly lady)\r\nreaders a full list of the names of those who were at last night's\r\nballs, under the head of \"Fashionable Entertainments.\" The _Post_ is the\r\none daily paper that systematically goes in for this kind of news,\r\npublishing every day during the season a long list of coming fixtures,\r\nas well as catalogues of the guests attending them. And I fear it must\r\nbe owned that there are people not a few who take delight in having\r\ntheir parties and appearances chronicled in this small-beer manner, and\r\nthat there are several grains of truth contained in the good-humoredly\r\nsarcastic lines in which that clever rhymer \"C.S.C,\" parodying the\r\n_Proverbial Philosophy_ of Mr. Tupper, gives worldly advice to young\r\nladies entering society. Says \"C.S.C.\":\r\n\r\n    Choose judiciously thy friends, for to discard them is undesirable;\r\n    Yet it is better to drop thy friends, O my daughter, than to drop\r\n        thy H's.\r\n    Dost thou know a wise woman? yea, wiser than the children of light?\r\n    Hath she a position? and a title? _and are her parties in the\r\n        Morning Post_?\r\n    If thou dost, cleave unto her, and give up unto her thy body and mind;\r\n    Think with her ideas, and distribute thy smiles at her bidding:\r\n    So shalt thou become like unto her, and thy manners shall be \"formed:\"\r\n    And thy name shall be a sesame at which the doors of the great shall\r\n        fly open:\r\n    Thou, shalt know every peer, his arms, and the date of his creation,\r\n    His pedigree and their intermarriages, and cousins to the sixth remove;\r\n    Thou shalt kiss the hand of royalty, and lo! in next morning's papers,\r\n    Side by side with rumors of wars and stories of shipwrecks and sieges,\r\n    Shall appear thy name, and the minutiæ of thy headdress and petticoat,\r\n    For an enraptured public to muse upon over their matutinal muffin.\r\n\r\nSociety expects every guest after a dance to go through the form of\r\npaying a call upon the giver. If you are an old friend of the house, or\r\nfor any reason want to go in, it will be wise to defer your visit for\r\ntwo or three days, until the interior of the house has recovered its\r\nnormal condition; for of course on the very day that follows a dance the\r\nrooms are in such a universal state of up-side-downness (if the word may\r\nbe coined) that callers can't expect to be admitted. For which reason,\r\nif you don't want to go in, you can't do better than select this very\r\nday for leaving a card at the door; which last ceremony duly concluded,\r\nall possible respect and duty may be taken to have been shown and done\r\nto the private ball: at all events, the present writer--rejoice,\r\nlong-suffering reader, if you still exist--has no further word or\r\nsuggestion to offer, on this occasion, on the subject.\r\n\r\nW. D. R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIVELIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN TWO PARTS.--I.\r\n\r\n\"What under the canopy is all that hammering at the door?\" said Mrs.\r\nLively, glancing up from her crocheting.\r\n\r\nMaster Napoleon Lively, the person appealed to, was sucking a lemon\r\nthrough a stick of candy. He took this from his mouth, said, \"Dunno,\"\r\nand then returned it to the anxious aperture.\r\n\r\n\"And don't care,\" said Mrs. Lively with spirit. \"Any other child in the\r\ncity would go to the door and find out what it means; but you! much you\r\ncare to save your mother's feet!\" Gathering her ball of worsted with the\r\ncrocheting in her left hand, she swept out of the room and through the\r\nhall to the front door. She pulled this open. There stood a man with\r\nhammer in hand.\r\n\r\n\"No harm to ye's, marm,\" he said. \"I's jist afther puttin' a bill on\r\nye's door; for shure it's to be sowld, that the house is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sold!\" cried Mrs. Lively. \"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"Faith! whiniver it may please a body to buy it,\" was the definite\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lively read the bill: \"'Six thousand dollars!' Why the whole\r\nproperty isn't worth six thousand, much less the lease for twelve years.\r\nWon't the owner take less?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's more than likely he would, 'specially from the likes of ye's.\r\nShure! folks most ginerly wants all they kin git, and ef they can't git\r\nit they'll be afther takin' less. The gintleman says as it must be sold\r\nimmadiate, for the owner is bruck to smitherations.\"\r\n\r\nHere was prospective trouble. Mrs. Lively went down the doorsteps and\r\nalong the paved walk to her husband's office, in the front basement. The\r\ndoctor laid down his pen, expecting a patient, but, seeing that it was\r\nonly his wife, resumed it.\r\n\r\n\"There's a bill put up on our door: the house is for sale--six thousand\r\ndollars. I'll warrant it could be got for five: I think it's worth six,\r\nthough. We may have to move out at a day's notice, and we've just had\r\nthis office newly papered, and the kitchen repainted, and, dear me! just\r\ngot those Brussels carpets down in the parlors. It's too provoking! I\r\nknow those carpets'll have to be cut and slashed into ribbons to make\r\nthem fit other rooms. I was afraid of that when I got them. Until you\r\nown a house we oughtn't to get anything nice. But, oh dear! if I waited\r\ntill we owned a home, I should go down to my grave on a two-ply. But\r\nwhere in the name of reason are we going? There isn't another vacant\r\nhouse in this neighborhood that I'd live in. And just think of the\r\ndamage to your practice in moving your office! What are we going to do?\r\nWhy in the world don't you say something? Can't you suggest something?\r\nOne would think you hadn't any interest in the matter. But it's always\r\nthe way. I've had to do all the planning for this family ever since I\r\ncame into it, and I came into it before it was a family. Oh, you needn't\r\nsmile: I know you're thinking that I haven't given you a chance to say\r\nanything; but I wouldn't talk if you'd talk, and I wouldn't bother\r\nmyself about our arrangements if you would. It's too provoking about\r\nthis house. It just suits me: there isn't a thing about it I should wish\r\nto have altered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Closets, little kitchen, back stairs,\" said Napoleon, who had entered\r\nthe office unobserved, and who had often heard his mother denounce the\r\nhouse as most inconvenient in these three particulars.\r\n\r\n\"What have you come for?\" the mother demanded sharply. \"Go back to the\r\nsitting-room, and learn your geography lesson for to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have learnt it,\" replied the imperturbable Napoleon.\r\n\r\n\"Then go and get your arithmetic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have got it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, get your history.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your grammar and spelling and German--you've learned them all, have\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go and take your walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have.\"\r\n\r\n\"For pity's sake, what is it you haven't done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every duty of life discharged, is it?\" and Mrs. Lively smiled in spite\r\nof herself.\r\n\r\n\"'Cept eating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except eating! Of course: I never knew a time in your life when you'd\r\nfinished up your eating.--What are you going to do about that bill?\"\r\nMrs. Lively continued, turning to her husband.\r\n\r\n\"I can't do anything about it except to leave it there,\" replied the\r\ngentleman, smiling quietly.\r\n\r\n\"It's exasperating,\" cried the lady. \"I don't see how I can ever give up\r\nthis house.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might buy it,\" said Dr. Lively. \"I've been thinking about it for\r\nsome time.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we? Where's the money?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have some in bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have, and you didn't let me know it, you mean, stingy thing!\" said\r\nMrs. Lively between a pout and a smile. \"How much have you in bank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Four or five thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, where did you get it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Saved it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you've always talked as poor as poverty, especially if I wanted a\r\nbonnet or anything--said you were barely making a living.\"\r\n\r\n\"No man is making a living till he can afford to own a home,\" said the\r\ndoctor, laying aside his pen. \"I'll go and see the agent, and learn what\r\nwe can get the house for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, beat him down: don't give him six thousand for it, and don't\r\ndecide on anything till you've consulted me. After all, there are a good\r\nmany things about this house that don't suit me. Maybe, we can get a lot\r\nand build a house to suit us better for the same money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly,\" said Dr. Lively.\r\n\r\n\"Well, really, I don't know about buying this house,\" said the lady in\r\nan undecided way. \"I should like to be nearer church, and Nappy ought to\r\nbe nearer his school.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my practice is all in this neighborhood, and it's a most excellent\r\nneighborhood--permanent: the people own their houses. To go into a new\r\nneighborhood would be like going into a new city. I should have to build\r\nup a practice with new people.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Lively saw the agent, and agreed to pay five thousand dollars in\r\ncash for the house, and five hundred in one year, at six per cent. \"Now,\r\nmy dear,\" he said to his wife, \"we've got to save that five hundred\r\ndollars this year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't I know that? I suppose, now, I shall have to hear that\r\nding-donged at me for the next twelve months. You'll fling it at me\r\nevery time I ask for change. I dare say before the year is out I shall\r\nrepent in sackcloth and ashes that we ever bought the house. Save it! Of\r\ncourse I've got to save it. It never enters your head that it's possible\r\nfor you to save anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who saved the five thousand?\" asked the doctor quietly.\r\n\r\n\"For pity's sake, how could I save it if you never gave it to me? I\r\ndidn't even know you'd made it. I'm sure my dress has been shabby enough\r\nto suit the stingiest mortal in existence. There isn't a woman in our\r\nchurch that dresses plainer than I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you are going out,\" said the doctor, changing the subject, \"you can\r\ncall at the savings bank and get the money: the agent will be here in\r\nthe morning with the papers.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lively came home in due time and displayed ten five-hundred-dollar\r\nbills. \"They offered to give me a cheque,\" she said, \"but these bills\r\nlook so much richer.\"\r\n\r\n\"But a cheque is safer in case of accident,\" the doctor suggested.\r\n\r\n\"What in the world's going to happen to-night? You are such a croaker,\r\nalways anticipating trouble!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no; I don't anticipate a fire or a robbery before morning,\" the\r\ndoctor said.\r\n\r\nThat night, when Mrs. Lively went to bed, she took the doctor's purse\r\nfrom his pocket and put it under her pillow. All night long she was\r\ndreaming about those bills. The next morning, when she woke, her first\r\nact was to look for the purse. There it was, just where she had placed\r\nit. She returned it to her husband's pocket, and then dressed without\r\nwaking him, for he had been called up that night to see a patient.\r\n\r\nVery promptly at eight o'clock the agent for the house presented himself\r\nin Dr. Lively's office. Who ever knew an agent behind time when a sale\r\nwas to be consummated?\r\n\r\nDr. Lively looked over the papers carefully, and, being satisfied,\r\nopened his purse to make the cash payment. If the agent's eyes had not\r\nbeen eagerly watching the purse for the forthcoming bills, but instead\r\nhad been fixed on Dr. Lively's face, they would have seen in it first a\r\nlook utterly blank, then one of intense alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me a moment,\" he said as he closed his purse. He left the office\r\nand hurried to Mrs. Lively's sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\"Well, is the deed done?\" the lady asked with the complacent air of a\r\nland-holder.\r\n\r\n\"What did you do with the money?\" the doctor asked anxiously. \"I thought\r\nyou put it in my purse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" replied Mrs. Lively, her eyes dilating with alarm.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't here,\" the doctor asserted. \"You must be mistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not mistaken,\" said the lady, panting with alarm. \"I did put it in\r\nyour purse. You've dropped it out somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is impossible: I haven't opened my purse since those bills were\r\nbrought into the house until just now in my office. You must have put\r\nthe bills somewhere else. Look in your purse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you I put the money in your purse,\" replied Mrs. Lively with\r\nasperity, at the same time opening her purse with an impatient movement.\r\n\"It isn't here: I knew it wasn't. I tell you again I put it in your\r\npurse, and you've dropped it out somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I haven't opened the purse till a moment since in my office,\" the\r\ndoctor reiterated.\r\n\r\n\"Then you've dropped the bills in the office.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not. I was holding the purse over the table when I opened\r\nit, and I perceived at once that it was empty, even to my small change.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that shows that the money has been dropped out of the purse some\r\ntime when you opened it. If I put the bills somewhere else, what's\r\nbecome of the change? You've lost it all out together, you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it must be in the house somewhere,\" said the doctor, evidently\r\nstaggered, \"for I haven't been out since those bills were brought home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you have,\" urged Mrs. Lively from her vantage-ground. \"You were\r\ncalled up last night to see that child on Morgan street.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I didn't lose it there. For when I wanted to make change for a\r\nfive-dollar bill, I found that I hadn't my purse; and that reminds me, I\r\nfound it in my pocket this morning, though it wasn't there last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can explain that,\" said Mrs. Lively after a moment's hesitation. \"I\r\nput the purse under my pillow last night, and returned it to your pocket\r\nthis morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then of course you lost the money out,\" said the doctor promptly.\r\n\r\n\"Of course! I might have known you would lay it on me if there was a\r\nshadow of a chance. I had nothing in the world to do with the losing of\r\nthat money.\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to have got a cheque.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why in Heaven's name didn't you tell me to?\"\r\n\r\nAll this while the two had been looking the room over, rummaging through\r\ndrawers, looking on whatnots, brackets, shelves, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can't keep the agent waiting any longer,\" said the doctor.\r\n\"I'll tell I him I'll bring the money round to him;\" and he left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"What are you standing there for?\" said Mrs. Lively, whirling sharply\r\non Napoleon. \"Go, and look for that money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I know where? Look anywhere and everywhere. There's no telling\r\nwhere your father lost it. Napoleon Lively,\" she exclaimed, a sudden\r\nidea seeming to strike her, \"what did you do with that money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" answered the youth with cool indifference.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you hide it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't hide it.\"\r\n\r\nHis perfect nonchalance was irresistibly convincing.\r\n\r\n\"Have you found it?\" said the doctor, re-entering the room.\r\n\r\n\"Found it!\" Mrs. Lively snapped out the words, and then her lips shut\r\nclose together as if with the vehemence of the snapping.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the house was entered last night,\" suggested the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I locked every door and window, and they were all locked this morning\r\nwhen I got up,\" replied Mrs. Lively. \"Perhaps you left the front door\r\nopen when you went out in the night. I'll warrant you did: it would be\r\njust like you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did _not_ leave the door open,\" replied the doctor. \"I found it\r\nlocked when I got back, and opened it with my night-key. Besides, I was\r\nnot out of the house more than forty minutes, and you told me when I got\r\nback that you hadn't been asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you I had scarcely been asleep,\" said Mrs. Lively.\r\n\r\nAll that day the Lively household was in extreme commotion. Every\r\nbedstead was stripped naked, and each article of bedding was separately\r\nshaken in the middle of the room; the contents of every drawer were\r\nturned out; every piece of furniture was moved; every floor was\r\ncarefully swept. The house, in short, was turned inside out.\r\nAdvertisements were put in the papers; handsome rewards were offered;\r\nthe police were notified of the loss. The detectives were of opinion\r\nthat the house had been entered, but there was not the slightest clew to\r\nthe burglars.\r\n\r\nIt was Friday, the sixth of October, when the loss was discovered. On\r\nthe seventh the house was again looked over, inch by inch.\r\n\r\n\"You _must_ have put that money somewhere else than in my purse,\" said\r\nDr. Lively to his wife. \"Have you looked in the pockets of all your\r\ndresses?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say to me again that I didn't put that money in your purse,\" said\r\nMrs. Lively vehemently: \"I won't bear it. You might as well tell me that\r\nI don't see you this minute. There never was anything in this world that\r\nmakes me so tearing mad as to be contradicted about something that I\r\nperfectly well know. I'd go into any court and swear that I put that\r\nmoney in your purse; and I don't want to hear any more of your\r\ninsinuations. Do you think I've stolen the money? You've lost it out of\r\nthe purse--that's all there is about it. This house has no more been\r\nentered than I've been burglaring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then where's the money?\"\r\n\r\n\"How in the name of sense do you think I know? I'd go and get it if I\r\nknew. Dear! dear! dear! dear! The savings of ten years gone in a night,\r\nafter all my pinching! I've done my own work--\"\r\n\r\n\"When you couldn't get a girl,\" said Napoleon.\r\n\r\n\"I've worn old-fashioned clothes; I've twisted and screwed in every\r\npossible way to save that money--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pa saved it,\" was Napoleon's emendation.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" retorted the lady, \"he'd better not have saved it: he'd better\r\nhave let his family have it. What's the use of saving money for\r\nburglars?\"\r\n\r\n\"You think now that the burglars have it?\" said the doctor dryly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for pity's sake, hush! I don't think anything about it. I believe\r\nI'm going insane. How in the universe we're ever going to live is more\r\nthan I can conceive.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, we are better off than we were ten years ago, for I yet have\r\nmy practice, and we are as well off as you thought we were two days ago;\r\nand you were happy then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Happy!\" There was a volume of bitter scorn in the word as Mrs. Lively\r\nuttered it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear!\" said the husband in a tone of piteous remonstrance.\r\n\r\nThe next evening, which was Sunday, Dr. Lively and wife went to church,\r\nand; heard a sermon by the Rev. Charles Hilmer from the words, \"Help one\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of preaching such stuff?\" said Mrs. Lively with\r\npetulance when they were out of church. \"Nobody heeds it. Who's going to\r\nhelp us in our loss?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our lesson from that sermon is, that we are to help others,\" said the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\"We help others! I'd like to know what we've got to help others with!\r\nFive thousand dollars out of pocket!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a fire somewhere,\" said the doctor as an engine whirled by them\r\nwhile they stood waiting for a car.\r\n\r\nThe lady and gentleman proceeded to their home on the South Side, and\r\nwent to bed, though the fire-bells were still ringing. About midnight\r\nthey were roused by a violent ringing of the door-bell. Dr. Lively\r\nstarted up with a patient on his mind. \"There's a fire somewhere,\" he\r\nexclaimed immediately, perceiving the glare in the room. Mrs. Lively was\r\nout of bed in an instant.\r\n\r\n\"Where? where's the fire?\" she cried. \"Is the house afire? I believe in\r\nmy soul it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Dr. Lively, who had gone to the window; \"but there's a\r\ntremendous fire to the south-west. The flames seem to be leaping from\r\nroof to roof. That was a policeman who rang us up. He seems to be waking\r\nall this neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\nThey dressed hurriedly, called up Napoleon, and went out at the front\r\ndoor, and on with the stream toward the fire. The street was crowded\r\nwith people, the air thick with noises, and everywhere it was as light\r\nas day. They passed on under the lurid heavens, and reached a hotel\r\nwhich stood open. Two streams of people were on the stairs--one hurrying\r\ndown, the other going up for a view of the fire. Our party followed the\r\nstream up the stairs and on to the roof. It was crowded with spectators,\r\nall greatly excited. Making their way to the front of the roof, our\r\ncouple stood spellbound by a vision which once seen could never be\r\nforgotten. It was like a look into hell. The whole fire seemed below\r\nthem, a surging, tempest-lashed ocean of flame, with mile-long billows,\r\nmile-high breakers and mile-deep shadows. All about the flaming ocean,\r\nexcept to the leeward, was a sea of faces, white and upturned, and rapt\r\nas with some unearthly vision. Stretching out for miles were housetops\r\nswarming with crowds, gazing appalled at the spectacle in which the fate\r\nof every man, woman and child of them was vitally involved. At times the\r\ngale, with a strong, steady sweep, would level the billows of fire, and\r\nbear the current northward with the majestic flow of a great river. Then\r\nthe flames would heave and part as with earthquake throes, dash skyward\r\nin jets and spouts innumerable, and pile up to the north-east mountains\r\nof fire that seemed to touch the heavens. Clouds of smoke obscured at\r\ntimes the view of the streets below, without making inaudible the roll\r\nof wheels, the beat of hoofs, the tramp of human feet, the cry of human\r\nvoices, the scream of the engines, the thunder of falling buildings, the\r\nmaniacal shriek of the gale, the Niagara-like roar of the fire; and ever\r\nand anon, striking through all the tumult, the deep, solemn voice of the\r\ngreat court-house bell, and the one word it seemed to say to the\r\ntrembling city--\"Doomed! doomed! doomed.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must go home,\" said Mrs. Lively in a lost, bewildered way.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" assented the doctor: \"there is no safety this side the river. All\r\nthe engines in creation couldn't stop that fire. Why in God's name don't\r\nthey pull down houses or explode them? Come!\"\r\n\r\nBut the lady continued to gaze in a fascinated way at the unearthly\r\nspectacle. It was all so wild, so awful, that the brain reeled. The\r\ndoomed houses in the path of the fire seemed to her to be animate\r\nthings--dumb, helpless, feeling creatures, that trembled and shrank as\r\nthe flames reached out cruel fingers for them. She shook off the\r\nbewildered, dazed feeling, but it came again as the tempest of flame and\r\nsmoke went racing to the north. Street and house and steeple and the\r\nvast crowds seemed sailing away on some swift crescent river to a great,\r\nvague, yawning blackness beyond.\r\n\r\nThey hurried down into the street. Momently the crowds, the tumult, the\r\nterror were growing. Every house stood open, the interior as clear as at\r\nnoonday. Men, women and children were moving about in eager haste,\r\ntearing up carpets, lifting furniture and loading trucks. Ruffians were\r\npushing in at the open doors, snatching valuables and insulting the\r\nowners. There was a hasty seizing of goods, and a wild dash into the\r\nstreet from imperiled houses, a shouting for trucks and carriages,\r\npiteous inquiries for absent friends, distressed cries for absent\r\nprotectors, screams of little children, swift, wild faces pushing\r\neagerly in this direction and that; oaths and prayers and shoutings;\r\nwomen bowed beneath mattresses and heavy furniture; wheels interlocking\r\nin an inextricable mass; horses rearing and plunging in the midst of\r\nwomen separated from their husbands and little children from their\r\nmothers; men bearing away their sick and infirm and their clinging\r\nlittle ones; the shower of falling brands, and the roar of the oncoming\r\nflood of destruction.\r\n\r\nIn the next block but one to our doctor's home a brand had lodged in the\r\nturret of a little wooden Catholic church, and, pinned there by the\r\nfierce gale, was being blown and puffed at as with a blowpipe. There was\r\nno time to lose. While he stopped on the street to secure a truckman,\r\nMrs. Lively hurried in to get together the most valuable of their\r\nbelongings. For a time she proceeded with considerable system, tying in\r\nsheets and locking in trunks the best of the bedding and other\r\nnecessaries. Then she got together some family relics, looked longingly\r\nat some paintings, took down a quaintly-carved Black-Forest clock from\r\nits shelf, and then set it back, feeling that something else would be\r\nmore needed. But as the roar of the tempest came nearer she was seized\r\nwith panic, and no longer knew what she did. When Dr. Lively came in to\r\nannounce the dray at the door he found his wife making for a trunk with\r\na tin baking-pan in one hand and a cloth duster in the other.\r\n\r\n\"For Heaven's sake, Priscilla, don't pack up such trash!\" he cried.\r\n\"Have you got up the parlor carpets?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear! no: I never thought of them. Nappy might get them up if he\r\nwould. Napoleon! Where under the sun is that boy? Napoleon!\" she called.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" answered Napoleon through a mouthful of cake. He entered with a\r\nbasket in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Why in the world don't you go to work and help?\"\r\n\r\n\"Am helping.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Packing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Packing what, I'd like to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Victuals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course! I might have known without asking. What in the world shall\r\nwe want with victuals, in the street without roof or bed?\"\r\n\r\nBut the father told him to hold on to his basket.\r\n\r\n\"You may be sure he'll do that,\" said the mother. \"What in the world are\r\nall those boxes you've got there?\" she asked as she dragged a sheet full\r\nof articles to the front door.\r\n\r\n\"Some things from my office,\" the doctor replied hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\"I just know they're those plants and fossils and casts and miserable\r\nthings that have been in my way everlastingly. I was in hopes they'd get\r\nburnt up.\"\r\n\r\nWithout heeding his wife, Dr. Lively disappeared into the house for\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\n\"Take those boxes off,\" she said to the drayman.\r\n\r\n\"Blast my eyes if I'm going to be lifting boxes off and on here all\r\nnight for any darned twenty-five dollars that ever was paid. Hurry your\r\nthings on here, or, by Godfrey! I'll dump 'em and be off. Blast me if\r\nI'll wait here a second beyond five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nJust then the doctor reappeared, and began to turn over the contents of\r\na sheet before tying it. \"Oh, my dear,\" he cried in a tone of mingled\r\nremonstrance and despair, \"we can't spare room for these worthless\r\ntraps;\" and he pitched out a pair of vases, two pin-cushions, a dustpan,\r\na sieve, a kitchen apron, a statuette of Psyche, a pair of plaster\r\nmedallions, _Our Mutual Friend_ in paper cover, a pink tarletan dress, a\r\ndirty tablecloth, an ice pitcher, a flat-iron, a mosquito-bar, a\r\nhoop-skirt, a backgammon-board and a bottle of hair restorative.\r\n\r\n\"They're worth a thousand times more than those old rocks and things\r\nyou've loaded up the dray with,\" Mrs. Lively maintained.\r\n\r\nAt last the truck moved off, followed by Dr. Lively, shouting to his\r\nwife to come on and not lose sight of him. Mrs. Lively seized a\r\ncarpet-bag in which she had packed her silver and jewelry, and rushed\r\ninto the street, screaming to Napoleon to follow and not lose sight of\r\nher. Napoleon hung his basket of provisions on his arm and stuck his hat\r\non his head. Then he went to the pantry and poked up cookies through a\r\nlift between his hat and forehead, until there was no vacant space\r\nremaining in the top of his hat. Then he crammed a cake in his mouth,\r\nfilled his pockets and both hands, and left the rest to their doom.\r\n\r\nThe wind, which for a time had blown steadily to the north-east, was now\r\nseemingly bewildered. At times there would be a dead calm, as though the\r\nfierce gale had tired itself out; then it would sweep roaring down a\r\nstreet with the force of a hurricane, and go shrieking through an alley\r\nas though sucked through a tube; again, it seemed to strike from every\r\nquarter of the compass, while anon a vast whirlwind was formed, swirling\r\nand circling till one half expected to see the glowing masses of masonry\r\nlifted and whirled like autumn leaves.\r\n\r\nOn went our party as fast as the press would permit. One bundle after\r\nanother, as it took fire from falling brands, was pitched off the truck\r\nand left to burn out on the pavement; and to these bundle-pitchings Mrs.\r\nLively kept up a running accompaniment of groans and ejaculations. When\r\nthey had reached the corner of Washington and La Salle, the truckman\r\nsignified his intention of throwing off his load.\r\n\r\n\"They'll be safe here,\" he said. Dr. Lively, too, thought this, for he\r\ndid not believe that the flames could pass the double row of fireproof\r\nbuildings on La Salle street and others in the neighborhood. But as he\r\nwas bound for a friend's house across the river, on the North Side, he\r\nwould of course have preferred to take his goods with him, even if there\r\nhad been no danger from pillagers. But no arguments or persuasions, even\r\nwhen offered in the shape of the gentleman's last five-dollar bill,\r\ncould induce the drayman to cross the river. He dumped on the sidewalk\r\nall that remained of the Livelies' earthly possessions, and disappeared\r\nin the press.\r\n\r\nAgain and again, but all in vain, Dr. Lively offered his forlorn hope,\r\nhis one greenback, to procure the transportation of his goods across the\r\nriver. But that five-dollar bill was so scorned and snubbed by the\r\nascendent truckmen that the doctor found himself smiling at his conceit\r\nthat the poor, despised thing, when returned to his purse, went\r\nsneakingly into the farthest and deepest corner.\r\n\r\nAs he could not leave his goods, it was decided that Mrs. Lively and\r\nNapoleon should cross the river without him. He sat down on Mrs.\r\nLively's big Saratoga trunk to await developments. He did not have to\r\nwait long. The double row of fireproofs, which was to have held the fire\r\nat bay, was attacked and went down; then the Chamber of Commerce melted\r\naway; shortly after the court-house was assailed. Dr. Lively gave up his\r\ntrunks and bundles as lost, and as too insignificant, in that wild\r\nhavoc, to be worth a sigh. He did feel a desire, however, for a clean\r\nshirt in which to face the heavens. Then, too, he wanted to bring\r\nsomething through the fire--to preserve something which would serve as\r\na memento of his ante-igneous life. The best thing in the way of a relic\r\nwhich he could secure was a case of sea-weeds mounted on cards. He made\r\na hasty bundle of these and a few articles of underwear, tucked it under\r\nhis arm, and then looked about him, considering which way he should go.\r\nThe wind had again risen to a hurricane. All around him was a storm of\r\nfire-brands, as though the flakes in a snow-storm had been turned to\r\nflame. Great sheets of blazing felt-roofing were driving overhead.\r\nEverywhere timbers and masonry were falling: walls a half square in\r\nlength came down with the thunder's crash, and in such quick succession\r\nthat the noise ceased to be noticed. Thousands of frantic people were\r\npushing wildly in every direction. The crowds seemed bewildered, lost,\r\nfrenzied. And what wonder? The world seemed to be burning up, the\r\nheavens to be melting: a star looked like a speck of blood, so that the\r\nwhole canopy of heaven when visible seemed blood-spattered.\r\n\r\nAs the doctor was gazing at the terrible spectacle the cry ran from\r\nmouth to mouth that all the bridges across the west branch of the river\r\nwere burned. There were thousands of spectators from the West Division\r\nwho had come over to witness the melting away of the South Side\r\nbusiness-palaces. If the bridges were burned, there remained but one\r\navenue by which they could reach their homes. There were cries of \"The\r\ntunnel! the tunnel!\" a panic and a grand rush, in which everybody was\r\nborne westward toward Washington street tunnel. Dr. Lively found himself\r\nforced into the tunnel. It was crowded with two streams of\r\nwildly-excited people moving in opposite directions. One was rushing to\r\nthe rescue of property on the South Side or to see the fire--the other,\r\nto get away from it. Most of these latter were carrying articles of\r\nfurniture and bales of goods, or they were wheeling loaded barrows.\r\nEverybody was crowding and pushing. Our doctor had made his way through\r\nabout one-third of the tunnel when suddenly every light went out. The\r\ngreat gasometer of the South Side gas-works had exploded. He was under\r\nthe river, in the bowels of the earth, in the midst of that wild crowd\r\nof humanity, and in utter darkness. \"There will be a panic,\" he thought:\r\n\"all the weak will be overrun and trampled to death. God help them and\r\nhelp us all!\" Then there came to him a flash of inspiration: \"Keep to\r\nthe right!\" he shouted, \"to the right!\" \"Keep to the right!\" repeated an\r\nabetting voice. \"To the right!\" \"Keep to the right!\" \"Right! right!\" The\r\nblessed words ran along from one end of the dark way to the other. Then\r\na hush seemed to fall on the lips as though the hearts were at prayer,\r\nand the two streams moved along like processions through the dark valley\r\nof the shadow of death.\r\n\r\nFacing about, Dr. Lively squeezed his way through a dense throng on\r\nNorth Water street bridge till he gained the North Division. Here he sat\r\ndown on the steps of a warehouse to take breath, and looked back on the\r\nscene he had left. The fire had reached the river, which reflected the\r\nlurid horror above, and seemed a stream of molten metal, or a current of\r\nglowing lava poured from some wide rent in the earth. Struggling human\r\ncreatures in the blazing, hissing, sputtering waters realized Dante's\r\nimaginings of tortured, writhing souls on the red floor of hell.\r\n\r\nTired and faint, Dr. Lively pressed on to the north. He was not long in\r\nlearning that the fire was already raging in the doomed North Division,\r\nand that the waterworks were disabled. Reaching the house of his friend,\r\nwhere his family had taken refuge, he found them all informed of the\r\nperil to the North Side, and getting ready to move. His friend decided\r\nto take refuge on the prairies. \"There we can keep up the race,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going where I can get water,\" said Dr. Lively: \"it's the only thing\r\nunder heaven that this fire-fiend won't eat. There isn't a suburb but\r\nmay be burned. I'm going toward the lake.\" So he took possession of his\r\nwife and boy and started for Lincoln Park. There were lights in all the\r\nhouses, and eager, swift-moving figures were seen through the doors and\r\nwindows: everywhere people were getting their things into the streets.\r\nShortly after, the flames, it was; noticed, were beginning to pale. A\r\nweird kind of light began to creep over burning house, blazing street\r\nand ruined wall. The day was dawning. With a kind of bewildered feeling\r\nour friends watched the coming on of the strange, ghostly morning, and\r\nsaw the pale, sickly, shamefaced sun come up out of the lake. It was ten\r\no'clock before they reached the old cemetery south of Lincoln Park.\r\nHundreds had already arrived here with their belongings, representing\r\nevery article that pertains to modern civilization. Parties were\r\nmomently coming in with more loads. Here our friends halted. Mrs. Lively\r\ndropped down in a fugitive rocking chair, thinking what a comfort it\r\nwould be to go off into a faint. But without a pillow or salts or\r\ncamphor it was a luxury in which she did not dare to indulge, though she\r\nhad a physician at hand. Right in front of her she noticed a besmutched,\r\nred-eyed woman who had something familiar in her appearance. \"Why, it's\r\nmyself!\" she said to her husband, pointing to a large plate mirror;\r\nleaning against an old headstone.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the doctor smiling, \"we all look like sweeps.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon seated himself on a grave and opened his lunch-basket.\r\n\r\n\"Did anybody ever?\" cried the mother. \"This boy's brought his basket\r\nthrough. There's nothing in all the world except something to eat that\r\nhe would have devoted himself to in this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could have proved more opportune,\" said the father.\r\n\r\nThen they ate their breakfast, sharing it with a little girl who was\r\ncrying for her father, and with a lady who was carrying a handsome dress\r\nbonnet by the ribbons, and who in turn shared her portion with her\r\npoodle dog. They offered a slice of cake to a sad old gentleman sitting\r\non an inverted pail with his hands clasped above a gold headed cane, and\r\nhis chin resting on them. He shook his head without speaking, and went\r\non gazing in a dreary, abstracted way into the air, as though oblivious\r\nof everything around him. \"'Though I make my bed in hell, behold, Thou\r\nart there,'\" he said in slow measured soliloquy. His lip began to quiver\r\nand the tears to stream down his furrowed face. Dr. Lively heard, and\r\nwiped his eyes on the back of his hand: he had nothing else to receive\r\nthe quick tears. Just then a hearse with nodding black plumes came by\r\nloaded with boxes and bundles, on which were perched a woman and five\r\nchildren, the three youngest crowing and laughing in unconscious glee at\r\ntheir strange circumstances. This was followed by two buggies hitched\r\ntogether, both packed with women and children drawn by a single horse,\r\nastride of which was a lame man.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, madam?\" said Dr. Lively to a woman who was wringing her\r\nhands and crying piteously.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you see,\" she said between her sobs, \"me and Johnny made our\r\nlivin' a-sellin' pop-corn; and last night we had a bushel popped ready\r\nfor the Monday's trade; and now it's all gone: we've lost\r\neverything--all that beautiful corn: there wasn't a single scorched\r\ngrain.\"\r\n\r\n\"But think what others have lost--their beautiful homes and all their\r\nbusiness--\"\r\n\r\nShe suddenly ceased crying, and, turning upon him, said sharply, \"We\r\nlost all we had: did they lose any more'n they had?\"\r\n\r\nA young man came pressing through the crowd, desperately clutching a\r\npicture in a handsome gilt frame. Through the smoke and smutch which\r\nstained the canvas was seen a gray-haired, saintly woman's head.\r\n\r\n\"The picture of his mother,\" thought the doctor with a swelling about\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n\"I saved dese,\" said a jolly-faced German, extending his two hands; \"and\r\ndey is all I had when I come from de Faderland to Chicago. And saved you\r\nnothin'?\"\r\n\r\nThe man appealed to had about him three children and a pale delicate\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n\"I saved these,\" he said with a gesture that was an embrace. \"All the\r\nbaby-faces we left hanging on the walls in the home where all were\r\nborn.\"\r\n\r\nThen the bearded lip quivered and the lids were dropped over the\r\nbrimming eyes. The mother looked up with clear, unfaltering features,\r\nand with a light grateful, almost joyous, in her fine eyes, and said\r\nsoftly, \"But all the real faces we've brought along.\"\r\n\r\nThen one of the little girls took up the story: \"Oh, mother, Tommy's\r\npicture will be burned, and we can never get another. Tommy's dead, you\r\nknow,\" she explained.\r\n\r\nThe mother's eyes grew misty, and so did the German's and the doctor's,\r\nand many others. There they were in that old deserted cemetery, a\r\ncompany of strangers, not one of whom had ever seen the other's face\r\nbefore, exchanging their confidences and mingling their tears.\r\n\r\nAll day long the fugitives poured into this strange encampment, and by\r\nnight they numbered thirty thousand. There was shouting, swearing,\r\nlaughing, weeping, waiting. There was pallid stupefaction, sullen\r\nsilence, faces of black despair--every kind of face except the happy\r\nvariety. The air was thick with frightful stories of arson; of men\r\nhanged to lamp-posts; of incendiaries hurled headlong into the fires\r\nthey had kindled; of riot, mobs and lawlessness. There was scarcely a\r\nsuburb that was not reported to be burning up, and prairie-fires were\r\nsaid to be raging. The fate of Sodom was believed to have overtaken\r\nChicago and her dependent suburbs.\r\n\r\n\"There's no safety here,\" said Mrs. Lively nervously as the flames\r\napproached the cemetery. \"Do let's get out of this horrid place. What in\r\nthe world do you want to stay here for?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" replied the doctor with a twinkle, \"I don't want to stay\r\nhere. We are not certainly safe, but I don't know of any place where our\r\nchances would be better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go down to the beach, get on a propeller and go out into the\r\nlake.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear, 'the Sands' and the lake shore are already thronged. It\r\nis said that people were lying in the lake, and others standing up to\r\ntheir necks in water--women with children in their arms. The propellers\r\nhave doubtless taken off fugitives to their entire capacity.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the fire came on. Everywhere over the dead leaves and\r\ndry grass and piles of household goods, and against the headboards and\r\nwooden crosses, the brands were falling; and the people were running and\r\ndodging, and fighting the incipient fires.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we shall be burned to death here: I knew all the time we should,\"\r\ncried Mrs. Lively, dodging to the right to escape a torch, and then\r\nrunning backward over a grave, beyond the reach of a second. Dr. Lively\r\nstamped out the fires. \"What under the sun are we going to do?\"\r\npersisted the lady.\r\n\r\n\"Dodge the brands--that's your work--and look out that Napoleon doesn't\r\nget on fire in one of his dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look there!\" said Napoleon.\r\n\r\n\"Look where?\" cried Mrs. Lively, whirling around.\r\n\r\n\"There.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is _there_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"The dead-house! Good Heavens! it's afire!\"\r\n\r\n\"This fire-demon,\" said the doctor, \"isn't going to let any of us off.\r\nIt strikes at the living through their dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe dead-house, fortunately empty, was consumed, the headboards and\r\ncrosses were burned, the trees were scorched and blackened, the graves\r\nwere seared: all the life which the years had drawn from the entombed\r\nashes was laid again in ashes.\r\n\r\nAfter a horrible suspense these graveyard campers saw the fiery tide\r\nrecede from their quarters and sweep on to the north. Then came on the\r\nweird, elfinish night, that mockery of day, when, except in the\r\ndirection of the lake, great mountains of fire loomed up on every side\r\nagainst the horizon, so that one felt environed, besieged, engirdled by\r\nhorrors.\r\n\r\n\"Try to get some sleep,\" said Dr. Lively to his wife when the torrent\r\nhad swept by to the north.\r\n\r\n\"Sleep!\" said Mrs. Lively. \"How can anybody sleep with these terrible\r\nfires all around? It seems to me as if I were in some part of the\r\ninfernal regions. I shall always know after this how hell looks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think the fire will trouble us any more to-night, but I'll\r\nwatch: there will be plenty of watchers, indeed, to give the alarm. Lie\r\ndown and try to get some rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where in the world is anybody to lie? On a grave? What in the world are\r\nyou eating?\" continued Mrs. Lively, turning on Napoleon.\r\n\r\n\"_Shoemake_\" answered the boy. \"Want some?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lively took some of the crimson, acrid berries and put them in her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\"You're hungry,\" said the father compassionately.\r\n\r\n\"Awful,\" answered the lad.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" asked the mother as he started off.\r\n\r\n\"To bed,\" he replied, and he stretched himself out on a piece of carpet\r\nwhere half a dozen children were sleeping.\r\n\r\n\"Now do, Priscilla, lie down and try to sleep,\" the husband insisted.\r\n\r\n\"How under the stars do you suppose I could sleep with hunger and thirst\r\ngnawing at the pit of my stomach? Do let me alone: I want to try to\r\nthink out something--to plan for the future. What under the sun is to\r\nbecome of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" said the doctor, \"don't worry about the future. I'll take\r\ncare of it some way, if the fire will ever let us out of our present\r\nprison. We have our lives, our hands and our heads, and we must thank\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heads! I feel as if I'd lost mine. I think sometimes that I'm insane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no: you ain't of the kind that go insane.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you mean by that I've got no feelings, no sensibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't mean that;\" and Dr. Lively became silent, as though it was\r\nuseless to prolong the conversation.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting together on the ground, she leaning against a\r\nheadstone.\r\n\r\n\"Let me sit there against that stone, and you put your head on my lap,\"\r\nthe doctor proposed.\r\n\r\n\"What in the world is the use of it?\" she said. \"Do you think I'm deaf\r\nthat I could sleep with all this moaning around me? Just hear it! One\r\nwould think all these graves had just been made, and that all these\r\npeople were chief mourners for the dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"The strangest bivouac ever seen under heaven!\" said the doctor, looking\r\naround. \"In a life liable to such vicissitudes,\" he continued softly,\r\n\"it is important that we possess our spirits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for pity's sake, don't preach! What's the use?\" said the wife.\r\n\r\n\"What's the use, indeed?\" said the husband in a saddened tone. \"If one\r\nheed not the voice of the past twenty-four hours--\" He left the sentence\r\nunfinished.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know. Everybody, the world over, will be preaching about Chicago.\r\nShe was so wicked. Sodom and Gomorrah and Babylon! That'll be the talk.\r\nI suppose we shall be told ten thousand times that riches have\r\nwings--just as though we hadn't seen the wings and couldn't swear to the\r\ncolor of them. But, dear me! I've been thinking that your story of\r\nlosses by the fire is not worth telling. I wish to goodness we'd bought\r\nthe house. If you hadn't lost the money, we might have now a\r\nrespectable-sized story to tell of our losses. I shall be ashamed to\r\ntell that we lost just some clothes and household traps, when some\r\npeople have lost millions. How much better it would sound to say that\r\nour house and everything in it was burned! People wouldn't know but it\r\nwas a fifty-thousand-dollar house. But a few chairs and bedquilts!--it's\r\ntoo small to talk about.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've lost enough to satisfy me,\" said the doctor. \"All my practice\r\nthat I've been ten years in building up! I'm exactly where I was when I\r\nbegan in Chicago. We own but five dollars in the world--haven't even a\r\nchange of clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've a mind to say that we had just bought the house, and it was\r\nburned,\" said Mrs. Lively. \"I'm sure it was just the same. But then you\r\nnever would stand by me in the story: you'd be sure to let the cat out.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what good would come of such a story?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Why, people would be so much sorrier for us. Nobody could feel sorry\r\nfor that old pop-corn woman you were talking to, even if she did lose\r\nall she had; and just so it will be with us. It's just like you to be\r\nalways missing a good thing. If you'd only bought the house before you\r\nlost the money!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're determined to saddle the loss of that money on me,\" the doctor\r\nsaid smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Well, who lost it if you didn't?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I can't say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you can't. You might as well say that black isn't black as\r\nthat you didn't lose that money.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll acknowledge, once for all, that I lost the money if you'll let the\r\nsubject drop,\" said he wearily. \"It's wasting time and breath to talk\r\nabout it. There,\" he continued soothingly, \"try to forget, and go to\r\nsleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's wasting time and breath telling me to go to sleep,\" replied the\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah! here's a cigar!\" said the doctor, producing one from his\r\npocket. \"Now, if I only had a match to light it!\"\r\n\r\n\"For patience' sake, you needn't be at a loss for a light for a cigar\r\nwhen all this universe is afire. Go and light it at that headboard over\r\nthere, and then sit down and take your comfort while I'm starving. Why\r\nin the world doesn't it rain? I don't see why the Lord should have such\r\na spite against Chicago: we ain't any worse than other people.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus the woman continued to run on all night. Up to two o'clock she\r\ncomplained because it didn't rain, and after that she shivered and\r\nmoaned because it did.\r\n\r\nWith the morning, water-carts and bakers' wagons began to arrive on the\r\nground. These were quickly emptied among the hungry, thirsty people. Dr.\r\nLively spent his five dollars to within fifty cents for the relief of\r\nthe sufferers about him. Mrs. Lively obstinately refused to take\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n\"I won't eat bread at twenty-five cents a loaf, and I won't drink water\r\nat ten cents a quart. I'll die first!\" she declared.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to take me to the West Division,\" Dr. Lively said to one of\r\nthe bakers. He had already tried a dozen times to make terms with\r\nteamsters to this end. \"I have a wife and child.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it for five dollars apiece,\" replied the man.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any money. Will you take a set of silver forks in pawn?\"\r\n\r\n\"He sha'n't have my forks,\" said Mrs. Lively violently.--\"How dare you\r\nspeculate on our calamities?\" she demanded of the baker. \"You sha'n't\r\nhave my forks: I'll stay here and starve first. I mean to stand this\r\nsiege of extortion to the last gasp.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear,\" remonstrated the doctor, \"there are people here who are\r\nalready near their last gasp. There are the sick and infirm and little\r\nchildren. There are women now on this desolate ground in the pangs of\r\nchildbirth, and infants not an hour old. These must have help. I must\r\nget over to the West Division. There are some hearts over there, I am\r\nsure.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take you, sir,\" said the baker, \"and I don't want none of your\r\nsilver. I'm beat, sir: I never thought of women hit that way. I can't\r\nfight with sich, and with babies born in a graveyard. I'm whipped, sir.\r\nI ain't never had much of a chance to make a extry dollar: I thought\r\nthis fire had give me a chance. My shop was left, full of flour. I was\r\nbakin' all night; but darn me if I kin put the screw onto babies, and\r\nwomen in childbed. You shall have my horse and cart and all my bakery\r\nfor 'em. Come, load up.\"[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It need scarcely be said that the incidents here related\r\nare literal facts, which came under the writer's observation in the\r\nmidst of the scenes described.]\r\n\r\nOn their way through the burnt district, on the ill-fated Chicago\r\nAvenue, they passed a ruined wall where people were preparing to dig out\r\ntwo men. One was crying piteously in mixed German and English for help.\r\nThe other, except his head and shoulders, was completely buried beneath\r\nthe ruins. As the people began to remove the rubbish he said in a tone\r\nexpressive at once of pluck and agony, \"Leave me, and go and get out\r\nthat bawling Dutchman: he ain't dead, and I am.\"\r\n\r\nAs it proved, he was broken all to pieces, both legs and both arms being\r\nfractured, one of the arms in two places.\r\n\r\nOf course Dr. Lively found the hearts he went to seek, not only among\r\nthe favored few whom God had spared the bitter cup, but all over the\r\nworld. We all know the beautiful story--how all the cities and villages\r\nand hamlets of the land were on the housetops, watching the burning of\r\nChicago, marking her needs, and speeding the relief as fast as steam and\r\nlightning could bring it. We know of that message of love, the sweetest,\r\nthe most wonderful the world ever heard since Christ died for us.\r\nThrough the pallid stupefaction, the sullen silence, the awful gloom,\r\nthe black despair that were settling over Chicago's heart, it pierced,\r\nand from all the world it came: \"We have heard thy cry, O our sister!\r\nOur hearts are aching for thee; our tears are flowing for thee; our\r\nhands are working for thee.\" Oh, how it electrified us in Chicago! If\r\nany refused, if any gave grudgingly, we saw it not, we knew it not. We\r\nsaw only the eager outstretched hand of love.\r\n\r\nAnd we know now the sequel of the wonderful story--how Chicago has\r\nproved herself worthy of the great love wherewith the world hath loved\r\nher, and of the great faith wherewith the world hath believed in her.\r\nShe has come up out of her bereavement strong through suffering, wearing\r\nyet her badge of mourning, her face subdued, but uplifted, wise and\r\nstrong of purpose; her eye sad, but earnest and true; her figure less\r\nimperious, but majestic and regal; her spirit less arrogant, but just as\r\nbrave, just as heroic, and more human.\r\n\r\nSARAH WINTER KELLOGG.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STRAYED SINGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of us know what a pathos is mixed with the sweet surprise of\r\nmeeting a beautiful thing in strange and inferior surroundings, in\r\ncircumstances that suggest an utter incongruity between the subject and\r\nthe situation, and imply an awful weight of loneliness and an\r\nintolerable lack of sympathy. The Alpine harebell on the edge of the\r\nglacier, the caged lion gazing vacantly into a wearisome monotony of\r\nidleness, the shivering little Italian fiddling about our winter\r\nstreets, make the same appeal, in various measure, to this consciousness\r\nof incongruity that in another phase would stimulate our laughter\r\ninstead of our tears.\r\n\r\nAs with space, so with time. It is the appreciation of the discord\r\nbetween the subject and its surroundings that awakens our sympathy for\r\nmen \"born out of their time,\" as we express it with an arrogance of\r\nwiser judgment. In every period of history, affronting the great\r\naverages of intellectual development, appear certain minds classified at\r\nonce as being either before or behind their age. To the first class\r\nbelong the great reformers, discoverers, inventors--men whose immense\r\ngenius, concentrated upon one idea, carries them beyond their fellows,\r\nas a straight-going steamer distances a pleasure-yacht. These men we do\r\nnot think of pitying, unless they come too near us, and then we call\r\nthem fools or fanatics.\r\n\r\nBut there are lost children of the second class whose fate we all\r\ndeplore--children of an earlier age or a summer clime, drifting about\r\nin this laborious world like helpless babes in the wood; bright-eyed,\r\nluxurious young Greeks, rebelling against pain and intolerant of toil,\r\nstruggling in vain to hold their own among keen, restless Yankees;\r\ndreamy mystics, strayed from the shadows of some cloister, their vague\r\neyes dazzled by the sun; artists of early Italy, worshiping the mediæval\r\nMadonna; poets, belonging of right to the court of Elizabeth, or\r\ncompanions of the wandering and disastrous fortunes of \"the fairest and\r\ncrudest of princesses.\"\r\n\r\nIt is of an Elizabethan poet strayed into our Victorian age that I\r\npropose to write. Few people except professed students of literature\r\nknow more of Thomas Lovell Beddoes than his name. More than a year ago\r\nan article on him appeared in the _Fortnightly_, half biographical, half\r\noccupied with a sketch of his principal tragedy--an article doing more\r\njustice to the dramatic than to the lyric quality of his genius. But it\r\nis by his songs that his name is kept in the minds of men\r\nto-day--exquisite snatches of melody, full of the peculiar charm of that\r\nElizabethan age to which they properly belong.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 an edition of his poems in two volumes, with a memoir and\r\nletters, was published by Pickering. The edition was small and soon\r\nexhausted, but the literary world of England was unanimous in its\r\npraise; and Landor, Browning, Proctor, and many others came out with\r\ngenerous tributes to the genius of that poet whose circle of listeners\r\nhas always been so small. \"Nearly two centuries have elapsed,\" wrote\r\nWalter Savage Landor, with his hearty enthusiasm, \"since a work of the\r\nsame wealth of genius as _Death's Jest-Book_ has been given to the\r\nworld.\" And Browning wrote to Mr. Kelsall, the author of the memoir:\r\n\"You might pick out scenes, passages, lyrics, fine as fine can be: the\r\npower of the man is immense and irresistible.\"\r\n\r\nThe two volumes contain, besides the Life and letters, two dramas, _The\r\nBrides' Tragedy_ and _Death's Jest-Book_, two unfinished plays,\r\n_Torrismond_ and _The Second Brother_, and many dramatic and poetic\r\nfragments and songs. The Life is an uneventful history, but the letters,\r\nthough singularly free from egotism, bring up before us a most\r\ninteresting character--a curious mixture of genius and want of faith in\r\nthat genius, of energy and self-distrust, of intense devotion to\r\npractical studies and the most impractical and dreamy fancy, an\r\naffectionate nature lonely and misunderstood, a spirit of the most\r\nsturdy and uncompromising independence, a mind of keen and scientific\r\ninsight--a character made up, in short, of all the warring elements of\r\nphilosopher, physician, politician and poet.\r\n\r\nThomas Lovell Beddoes was born in Clifton in 1803, and died at Bâle in\r\nSwitzerland in 1849. His mother was a sister of Maria Edgeworth, and his\r\nfather a distinguished physician and an intimate friend of Sir Humphry\r\nDavy. In the father's character we may trace the principal traits of the\r\nson: a strong scientific bent, a fondness for poetic dreams, an\r\ninvincible independence, were predominant in both. The character of\r\nLovell Beddoes' poetry was the natural outgrowth of his early studies.\r\nHis schoolfellows at the Charterhouse speak of him at the age of\r\nfourteen as already thoroughly versed in the best English literature and\r\na close student of the dramatists, from the Elizabethan to those of his\r\nown day. He was always ready to invent and carry out any acts of\r\ninsubordination, which he informed with so much wit and spirit that the\r\nvery authorities were often subdued by their own irresistible laughter.\r\nIt was one phase of his dramatic genius, that seemed to be constantly\r\nimpelling him to get up some striking situation wherein he might pose as\r\na youthful Ajax defying the lightnings. At Oxford his restless\r\nindependence was continually prompting him to affront his tutors. He was\r\nalways in opposition to the spirit of the occasion, whatever it might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThis spirit of rebellion inspired him with an intense interest in German\r\nliterature and German politics, as representing the ultra-liberal\r\ntendencies of the day. Shelley, too, the rejected of Oxford, whose name\r\nwas scarcely to be mentioned to the British Philistine of the moment,\r\nwas one of Beddoes' idols, and he joined with two other gentlemen in the\r\nexpense of printing the first edition of the poet's posthumous works in\r\n1824, afterward withdrawn by Mrs. Shelley. Byron was the popular poet\r\nthen, and universal Young England was turning down its shirt-collars in\r\na mockery of woe. But this boy of twenty, with his sturdy independence,\r\nwould judge for himself, and wrote to a friend: \"I saw ---- (the\r\ngreatest fool within the walls of my acquaintance) the other night at\r\nOxford, repeating the whole of the _Deformed_ in raptures. God forgive\r\nhim!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1821, while yet a freshman, he published a little volume of poems\r\ncalled _The Improvisatore_, of which he was soon ashamed. Long before he\r\nleft Oxford he used to hunt the unfortunate volume through the libraries\r\nof his acquaintance, and cutting out all the pages leave the binding\r\nintact, a hollow mockery, upon their shelves. The next year, however, he\r\npublished _The Brides' Tragedy_, a drama of very great originality and\r\npower, and a most extraordinary production for a boy of nineteen. The\r\n_Edinburgh Review_ and the _London Magazine_. then at the height of\r\ntheir power, came out with critical and highly laudatory notices by\r\nProctor (Barry Cornwall) and George Darley, and the former was ever\r\nafter one of Beddoes' warmest personal friends. In July, 1825, he went\r\nto Göttingen, where his brilliant achievements as a student of medicine\r\nwon him numerous honors. The rest of his life was spent in Germany and\r\nSwitzerland, with occasional brief visits to England, but his heart was\r\nwith the German radicals, and he found the united attractions of\r\nscience, liberalism and Swiss scenery far more powerful than love of his\r\nnative land. He threw himself with enthusiasm into the discussion of the\r\nscientific and political questions of the day, soon became a master of\r\nthe language, wrote a great deal for the German newspapers, both in\r\nprose and verse, and used jestingly to call himself \"a popular German\r\npoet.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time he began his finest tragedy, _Death's Jest-Book_, still\r\nundergoing correction and revision at the time of his death in his\r\nforty-sixth year. He was never weary of making alterations: never\r\nsatisfied with the result of his labors, he tore up scene after scene,\r\nor struck out remorselessly the finest passage in a drama if he thought\r\nit inharmonious with the context. He had a theory that no man should\r\ndevote himself entirely to poetry unless possessed of most extraordinary\r\npowers of imagination, or unfitted, by mental or bodily weakness, for\r\nseverer scientific pursuits. The studies of the physician and the\r\ndramatist were to his mind allied by Nature, and he looked upon tragedy\r\nas the fitting and inevitable result of combined physiological and\r\npsychological researches. And he afterward declared himself determined\r\n\"never to listen to any metaphysician who is not both anatomist and\r\nphysiologist of the first rank.\" This was in 1825, when German and\r\nFrench scientists were just beginning to explore the hidden mysteries of\r\nmatter, and to trace its intimate and subtle connections with the mind,\r\nand when protoplasm was still an unknown quantity toward whose discovery\r\nscience was slowly feeling its way.\r\n\r\nAs he penetrated deeper and deeper into the arcana of anatomy and\r\nphysiology his judgment of his own poetry grew more and more severe. The\r\nmore he knew of Truth, the nearer absolute perfection must that Beauty\r\nbe which would compete with her for his heart. Busy with a pursuit in\r\nwhich his progress was marked by absolute tests that even his modesty\r\ncould not disown, he shrank from trying to reach vague eminences in\r\npoetry that he judged himself unable to attain. There is something in\r\nhis style that recalls Heine when he writes, \"Me you may safely regard\r\nas one banished from a service to which he was not adapted, but who has\r\nstill a lingering affection for the land of dreams--as yet, at least,\r\nnot far enough in the journey of science to have lost sight of the old\r\ntwo-topped hill.\" And again: \"I am essentially unpoetical in character,\r\nhabits and ways of thinking; and nothing but the desperate hanker for\r\ndistinction so common to the young gentlemen at the university ever set\r\nme upon rhyming. If I had possessed the conviction that I could by any\r\nmeans become an important or great dramatic writer, I would have never\r\nswerved from the path to reputation; but seeing that others who had\r\ndevoted their lives to literature, such as Coleridge and Wordsworth--men\r\nbeyond a question of far higher originality and incomparably superior\r\npoetical feeling and genius--had done so little, you must give me leave\r\nto persevere in my preference of Apollo's pill-box to his lyre, and\r\nshould congratulate me on having chosen Göttingen instead of Grub street\r\nfor my abode.... It is good to be tolerable or intolerable in any other\r\nline, but Apollo defend us from brewing all our lives at a\r\nquintessential pot of the smallest ale Parnassian!\"\r\n\r\nThere are so many racy bits of anecdote and opinion scattered through\r\nthis correspondence, so many things worth keeping for their own sakes or\r\nas throwing new light upon the character of their writer, that it is\r\nhard to choose a single specimen, but with one more extract we must\r\nstrive to be content. Beddoes' friend and editor had been trying to get\r\nfrom him some personal details about his daily life, pursuits and\r\nfancies, which, with his usual horror of the egotistical, he flatly\r\ndeclined to give. \"I will not venture on a psychological\r\nself-portraiture,\" he writes, \"fearing--and I believe with sufficient\r\nreason--to be betrayed into affectation, dissimulation or some other\r\nalluring shape of lying. I believe that all autobiographical sketches\r\nare the result of mere vanity--not excepting those of St. Augustine and\r\nRousseau--falsehood in the mask and mantle of truth. Half ashamed and\r\nhalf conscious of his own mendacious self-flattery, the historian of his\r\nown deeds or geographer of his own mind breaks out now and then\r\nindignantly, and revenges himself on his own weakness by telling some\r\nvery disagreeable truth of some other person; and then, re-established\r\nin his own good opinion, marches on cheerfully in the smooth path toward\r\nthe temple of his own immortality. Yet even here, you see, I am\r\nindirectly lauding my own worship for not being persuaded to laud my own\r\nworship. How sleek, smooth-tongued, paradisaical a deluder art thou,\r\nsweet Self-conceit! Let great men give their own thoughts on their own\r\nthoughts: from such we can learn much; but let the small deer hold jaw,\r\nand remember what the philosopher says, 'Fleas are not lobsters: d----n\r\ntheir souls!'\"\r\n\r\nCaring nothing even for professional honors, Beddoes refused various\r\nprofessorships in Germany, and traveled about to Zurich, to Bâle, and to\r\nthe other German centres of learning as his desires prompted him. Always\r\nthe same independent and rebellious spirit that he had shown himself as\r\na boy, he sympathized warmly with the democratic movements then\r\nagitating Switzerland and the Rhine provinces, and devoted both his\r\npurse and his pen to aid the anti-oligarchic and anti-clerical party. In\r\n1848 he had intended to go back to England, but in the spring of that\r\nyear a slight wound received while dissecting infused a poison into his\r\nsystem that undermined his health. In May, while seeking restoration in\r\nthe purer air of Bâle, his horse fell with him, and his left leg was so\r\nbadly broken that amputation became necessary. Until the autumn he\r\nseemed to be doing well, but then the poison imbibed at Frankfort\r\ndeclared itself once more, and a slow fever set in which terminated in\r\ndeath on the 26th of January, 1849.\r\n\r\nBeddoes' great fault as a dramatist he was quite aware of himself, and\r\nhad pointed out to the friend who was continually urging him to write:\r\n\"The power of drawing character and humor--two things absolutely\r\nindispensable for a good dramatist--are the first two articles in my\r\ndeficiencies; and even the imaginative poetry I think you will find in\r\nall my verse always harping on the same two or three principles; for\r\nwhich plain and satisfactory reasons I have no business to expect any\r\ngreat distinction as a writer.\" He could draw types of character, but\r\nnot individuals: the power of making the creations of the mind seem as\r\nreal as \"our dear intimates and chamber-fellows\" was denied him. But he\r\nwas not wholly destitute of humor, though he was possessed of but one\r\nkind--that grim, sardonic quality which we find so often among the\r\nElizabethans--that mocking irony most like the grin upon a skull. His\r\nfools are his best characters, so far as strength and originality go.\r\nHere is a snatch from the wise conversation of two of these worthies in\r\n_Death's Jest-Book_:\r\n\r\n\"_Isbrand._ Good-morrow, Brother Vanity! How? soul of a pickle-herring,\r\nbody of a spagirical tosspot, doublet of motley, and mantle of pilgrim,\r\nhow art thou transmuted! Wilt thou desert our brotherhood, fool\r\nsublimate? Shall the motley chapter no longer boast thee? Wilt thou\r\nforswear the order of the bell, and break thy vows to Momus? Have mercy\r\non Wisdom and relent.\r\n\r\n\"_Mandrake._ Respect the grave and sober, I pray thee. To-morrow I know\r\nthee not. In truth, I mark that our noble faculty is in its last leaf.\r\nThe dry rot of prudence hath eaten the ship of fools to dust: she is no\r\nmore seaworthy. The world will see its ears in a glass no longer. So we\r\nare laid aside and shall soon be forgotten; for why should the feast of\r\nasses come but once a year, when all the days are foaled of one mother?\r\nO world! world! The gods and fairies left thee, for thou wert too wise;\r\nand now, thou Socratic star, thy demon, the great Pan, Folly, is parting\r\nfrom thee. The oracles still talked in their sleep, shall our\r\ngrandchildren say, till Master Merriman's kingdom was broken up: now is\r\nevery man his own fool, and the world's sign is taken down.\r\n\r\n\"_Isbrand._ Farewell, thou great-eared mind! I mark, by thy talk, that\r\nthou commencest philosopher, and then thou art only a fellow-servant out\r\nof livery.\"\r\n\r\nIsbrand is the brother of the slain knight Wolfram: his foolery is but\r\nthe disguise of his revenge, and thus he rails over the body of his\r\nbrother: \"Dead and gone! a scurvy burden to this ballad of life. There\r\nlies he, Siegfried--my brother, mark you--and I weep not, nor gnash the\r\nteeth, nor curse: and why not, Siegfried? Do you see this? So should\r\nevery honest man be--cold, dead, and leaden-coffined. This was one who\r\nwould be constant in friendship, and the pole wanders; one who would be\r\nimmortal, and the light that shines upon his pale forehead now, through\r\nyonder gewgaw window, undulated from its star hundreds of years ago.\r\nThat is constancy, that is life. O moral Nature!\"\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to try to describe the plot of this strange drama, if\r\nplot it may be called. The poem rather resembles the old bridge at\r\nLucerne with the gloomy figures of the Dance of Death painted along its\r\nwormeaten sides, while over its old timbers rolls the current of busy\r\nlife, and the laughter of children echoes from its roof. With the\r\nexception of Isbrand, the characters of the play are pale and shadowy\r\nenough, but the poetry that they speak is wonderful. The gloom and\r\ntender beauty of the verse are inextricably united, as in the plays of\r\nWebster, whose \"intellectual twin\" Beddoes might have been. Here is a\r\nlovely sketch of \"a melancholy lady:\"\r\n\r\n      _Duke._ Thorwald, I fear hers is a broken heart.\r\n    When first I met her in the Egyptian prison,\r\n    She was the rosy morning of a woman:\r\n    Beauty was rising, but the starry grace\r\n    Of a calm childhood might be seen in her.\r\n    But since the death of Wolfram, who fell there,\r\n    Heaven and one single soul only know how,\r\n    I have not dared to look upon her sorrow.\r\n\r\n      _Thorwald._ Methinks she's too unearthly beautiful.\r\n    Old as I am, I cannot look at her,\r\n    And hear her voice, that touches the heart's core,\r\n    Without a dread that she will fade o' th' instant.\r\n    There's too much heaven in her; oft it rises,\r\n    And, pouring out about the lovely earth,\r\n    Almost dissolves it. She is tender too;\r\n    And melancholy is the sweet pale smile\r\n    With which she gently does reproach her fortune\r\n\r\nBut the greatest beauty of this singular poem, with its wild medley of\r\njesters and spirits, knights and fiends, Deaths and tender women, \"like\r\nflowers on a grave,\" is the wonderful perfection of its songs. There are\r\nno less than thirteen in this play, some of them the wild mockery\r\nremind us of their faults. A turgid inflation in the tragic passages, a\r\ntendency to bombast, even more apparent in the man of forty-six than in\r\nthe boy of nineteen, mar the calm strength of many of his scenes. The\r\ncloying sweetness that overloaded the verses of his juvenile work he\r\nleft behind him as he grew older, but the Marlowe-like extravagance that\r\nnoted in the soliloquies of _Hesperus_ still comes to the surface\r\noccasionally in the pages of _Death's Jest-Book_. It is the extravagance\r\nof strength, however, not of weakness.\r\n\r\nIt is not often that we see a poet giving up the glorious race from\r\nsheer distrust of his power to win, but such was the case of Beddoes. A\r\nwant of faith in his own genius was for ever paralyzing his hand. To\r\nsucceed, as he himself knew but too well, and as he wrote to his editor,\r\n\"a man must have an exclusive passion for his art, and all the obstinacy\r\nand self-denial which is combined with such a temperament--an\r\nunconquerable and always enduring will, always working forward to the\r\nonly goal he knows.\" This singleness of purpose Beddoes never possessed.\r\nInheriting from his father the qualities of both poet and physician, the\r\nfaculties of the scientific man, trained and cultivated through a long\r\nlife by Dr. Thomas Beddoes (with whom poetry was but an occasional\r\npastime), seem to have overbalanced and diverted the poetic genius of\r\nhis son. The hereditary instinct overcame the individual bent. And in\r\nspite of Lovell Beddoes' opinion that \"the studies of the dramatist and\r\nphysician are closely, almost inseparably, allied,\" is it not true that\r\nthe analytical faculty so essential to the latter is rarely found in\r\nconnection with great creative ability? Sainte-Beuve never forgave\r\nBalzac for saying that critics were unsuccessful authors, but he should\r\nhave consoled himself with the of the jesters, but many of them very\r\nbeautiful; and there are three more in _The Brides' Tragedy_. Since the\r\ndays of Elizabeth we have had nothing to compare with them. They have\r\nthat delicate poise of beauty, like the lighting of a butterfly on a\r\nbending flower, that adds to our delight the keen sense of its\r\ntransitoriness. Here is one--\"a voice from the waters:\"\r\n\r\n    The swallow leaves her nest,\r\n    The soul my weary breast;\r\n    But therefore let the rain\r\n      On my grave\r\n    Fall pure; for why complain?\r\n    Since both will come again\r\n      O'er the wave.\r\n\r\n    The wind dead leaves and snow\r\n    Doth hurry to and fro;\r\n    And once a day shall break\r\n      O'er the wave,\r\n    When a storm of ghosts shall shake\r\n    The dead, until they wake\r\n      In the grave.\r\n\r\nThis is the least Elizabethan of them all, perhaps, in sentiment, but it\r\nhas an exquisite sombre tenderness and music of its own. Then follows\r\none of the finest of all Beddoes' songs, a dirge, beginning--\r\n\r\n    If thou wilt ease thine heart\r\n    Of love and all its smart,\r\n      Then sleep, dear, sleep;\r\n\r\nwhich it is useless to quote entire, because it may be found in Dana's\r\n_Household Poetry_, and in the best collection of songs we have, R. H.\r\nStoddard's _Melodies and Madrigals_, wherein are enshrined three of\r\nBeddoes' dirges, all from this one drama of _Death's Jest-Book_.\r\n\r\nThe second volume of Beddoes' poems also contains _The Brides' Tragedy_,\r\nwritten when he was but nineteen. More simple and coherent in plot and\r\nconstruction than the other drama, it has more sweetness and less\r\nstrength. It is full of the innocence of love, and rich with that\r\nprodigality of beauty with which youthful genius loves to make itself\r\nsplendid. It begins with a scene in a garden, and \"while that wingèd\r\nsong, the restless nightingale, turns her sad heart to music,\" two\r\nlovers talk of flowers and love and dreams--dreams of the Queen of\r\nSmiles, and her attendant mob of Loves, busy with their various tasks:\r\n\r\n            Here stood one alone,\r\n    Blowing a pyre of blazing lovers' hearts\r\n    With bellows full of absence-caused sighs:\r\n    Near him his work-mate mended broken vows\r\n    With dangerous gold, or strung soft rhymes together\r\n    Upon a lady's tress.... And one there was alone,\r\n    Who with wet downcast eyelids threw aside\r\n    The remnants of a broken heart, and looked\r\n    Into my face and bid me 'ware of love,\r\n    Of fickleness, and woe, and mad despair.\r\n\r\nThere are beautiful scenes and passages all through the play, the\r\npassion and the terror smacking somewhat of youth, perhaps, that loves\r\nto pile up agonies, but the poetry still so fine that one continually\r\nforgets to say, This is the work of a boy of nineteen. There is no need\r\nto say it, in fact: it is a work of genius, and demands no extenuation.\r\nThere is a scene between Olivia and her attendants, as they prepare her\r\nfor her bridal, that has a sustained and tender sweetness and calm about\r\nit hard to be matched in all our modern drama. For the same Olivia is\r\nsung this lovely\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG, BY TWO VOICES.\r\n\r\n    _First Voice._ Who is the baby that doth lie\r\n    Beneath the silken canopy\r\n    Of thy blue eye?\r\n\r\n    _Second Voice._ It is young Sorrow laid asleep\r\n    In the crystal deep.\r\n\r\n    _Both._ Let us sing his lullaby,\r\n    Heigho! a sob and a sigh.\r\n\r\n    _First Voice._ What sound is that, so soft, so clear,\r\n    Harmonious as a bubbled tear\r\n    Bursting, we hear?\r\n\r\n    _Second Voice._ It is young Sorrow, slumber breaking,\r\n    Suddenly waking.\r\n\r\n    _Both._ Let us sing his lullaby,\r\n    Heigho! a sob and a sigh.\r\n\r\nThey are not all dirges, these beautiful scraps of melody. Sometimes we\r\ncome upon one as blithe as sunshine, like this serenade from the fine\r\nfragment called _The Second Brother_:\r\n\r\n    Strike, you myrtle-crownèd boys,\r\n      Ivied maidens, strike together:\r\n    Magic lutes are these whose noise\r\n      Our fingers gather,\r\n    Threaded thrice with golden strings\r\n      From Cupid's bow:\r\n    And the sounds of its sweet voice\r\n    Not air, but little busy things,\r\n      Pinioned with the lightest feather\r\n        Of his wings,\r\n      Rising up at every blow\r\n    Round the chords, like flies from roses\r\n      Zephyr-touched; so these light minions\r\n      Hover round, then shut their pinions,\r\n    And drop into the air, that closes\r\n    Where music's sweetest sweet reposes.\r\n\r\nThere is a song worthy of Ariel, whose delicate involutions well repay\r\nstudy, and whose perfect melody carries along the unfolding of the\r\nthought as easily and lightly as a swift stream sweeps along scattered\r\nrose-leaves. And here is another of the same dainty complexion, but\r\nsimpler:\r\n\r\n    How many times do I love thee, dear?\r\n      Tell me how many thoughts there be\r\n        In the atmosphere\r\n        Of a new-fall'n year,\r\n    Whose white and sable hours appear\r\n      The latest flake of Eternity:\r\n    So many times do I love thee, dear.\r\n\r\n    How many times do I love again?\r\n      Tell me how many beads there are\r\n        In a silver chain\r\n        Of evening rain,\r\n    Unraveled from the tumbling main,\r\n      And threading the eye of a yellow star:\r\n    So many times do I love again.\r\n\r\nNor is it only the songs of Beddoes that ought to keep his memory alive\r\namong us, if his dramas are too long to enchain our fickle attention. We\r\nturn over the small collection of fragments that his stern judgment has\r\nspared from the material of his two finished plays, to come across\r\nthoughts like these, that would have made the best part of some less\r\nsevere critic's pages:\r\n\r\n      I know not whether\r\n      I see your meaning: if I do, it lies\r\n      Upon the wordy wavelets of your voice\r\n      Dim as the evening shadow in a brook,\r\n      When the least moon has silver on't no larger\r\n      Than the pure white of Hebe's pinkish nail.\r\n\r\n    And many voices marshaled in one hymn\r\n    Wound through the night, whose still, translucent moments\r\n    Lay on each side their breath; and the hymn passed\r\n    Its long harmonious populace of words\r\n    Between the silvery silences.\r\n\r\n    Luckless man\r\n    Avoids the miserable bodkin's point,\r\n    And flinching from the insect's little sting,\r\n    In pitiful security keeps watch,\r\n    While 'twixt him and that hypocrite the sun.\r\n    To which he prays, comes windless Pestilence,\r\n    Transparent as a glass of poisoned water\r\n    Through which the drinker sees his murderer smiling:\r\n    She stirs no dust, and makes no grass to nod,\r\n    Yet every footstep is a thousand graves,\r\n    And every breath of hers as full of ghosts\r\n    As a sunbeam with motes.\r\n\r\nThere is an old saying that the workman may be known by his chips:\r\nsurely from these chips we may gather a high opinion of that artificer\r\nwho left such fragments to testify for him. For imaginative power of a\r\nvery high order, for the true tragic spirit, for exquisitely melodious\r\nversification, for that faculty of song which is the flower of the lyric\r\ngenius, Beddoes was pre-eminently distinguished. Nor for these alone.\r\nHis style is based upon the rich vocabulary of the old dramatists, and\r\nis terse, pregnant and quaint, without any trace of affectation. There\r\nwas a sturdy genuineness about the man that forbade him to assume, and\r\nhis phraseology was the natural outgrowth of his mind and his early\r\neducation. He has not gone to work, like so many of our modern\r\npre-Raphaelite painters, to imitate crudeness of form in the vain hope\r\nof acquiring thereby earnestness and innocence of spirit; but he has\r\nstudied the best tragic models in a reverent spirit, and allowed his\r\nmuse to work out her own salvation. That grim ironical humor which\r\ninfuses such bitter strength into the speeches of Isbrand was always\r\nscoffing at his own verses, and nipping the blossoms of his genius in\r\nthe bud. \"I believe I might have met with some success as a retailer of\r\nsmall coal,\" he writes to Mr. Kelsall, \"or a writer of long-bottomed\r\ntracts, but doubt of my aptitude for any higher literary or commercial\r\noccupation.\"\r\n\r\nHis greatest weakness as a writer of tragedy has already been mentioned\r\nas one of which he was himself but too well aware--his inability to\r\ncreate characters that should have any more individual existence than as\r\nthe mouthpieces of various sentiments. While holding that the proper aim\r\nof the dramatic writer should be to write for the stage, his dramas are\r\nnevertheless fitted only for the closet. \"If it were possible,\" said\r\nGeorge Darley (in the _London Magazine_, December, 1823), \"speaking of a\r\nwork of this kind (_The Brides' Tragedy_), to make a distinction between\r\nthe _vis tragica_ and the _vis dramatica_, I should say that he\r\npossessed much of the former, but little of the latter.\" As the beauties\r\nof his style--and they are many--recall to us the Shakespearian writers\r\nand the matchless riches of their verse, so do its faults--which are\r\nfew--reflection that the author was unsuccessful because the critic was\r\ngreat. All critics, however, do not aspire to create, but all poets\r\nsooner or later attempt to criticise. Baudelaire, \"the illustrious poet,\r\nthe faultless critic,\" as Swinburne calls him, went still further. He\r\nsaid: \"Tous les grands poëtes deviennent naturellement, fatalement,\r\ncritiques. Je plains les poëtes que guide le seul instinct; je les crois\r\nincomplets. Il serait prodigieux qu'un critique devînt poëte, et il est\r\nimpossible qu'un poëte ne contienne pas un critique.\" Yet a man cannot\r\nserve two masters, and Art is a jealous mistress who will not brook a\r\nrival. Even Beddoes found that his ideal of the physiologist-poet was\r\nfast slipping through his fingers, and confessed at last that were he\r\n\"soberly and mathematically convinced\" of his own inspiration, he would\r\ngive himself up to the cultivation of literature. But he died at the\r\nearly age of forty-six, from the effects of a wound received in the\r\ncause of Science. A singular retribution befell him, a truly poetic\r\njustice: all his scientific writings have disappeared--were either\r\nstolen before his executors had time to examine his papers, or had been\r\ndestroyed by his own ruthless hand--and all that was left to keep his\r\nmemory alive were the two tragedies and the few scattered fragments of\r\nverse of which he had made so little account during his lifetime. Their\r\ncircle of readers has necessarily been small, but choice. There are few\r\nleft, besides Browning and Proctor and John Forster, of his original\r\nadmirers, and his name seems to be another on the long list of those who\r\nhave failed, as the world counts failure. But the poets know better, and\r\namong their undying brotherhood space will always be kept for this\r\nstrayed singer.\r\n\r\nKATE HILLARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVEST.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gray orchards starred with fruitage gold and red,\r\n      Field beyond field of yellow-tasseled corn,\r\n      Rippling responsive to each breath of morn.\r\n    Along the Southern wall the dark vines shed\r\n      Their splendid clusters, blue-black and pale green,\r\n      With liquid sunshine through their thin films seen.\r\n    In yonder mead the haymakers at work\r\n      With lusty sounds the clear tense air fulfill,\r\n      Rearing the shapely hayrick's mimic hill,\r\n    The dried grass tossing with light-wielded fork.\r\n\r\n    Daylong the reapers glean the bladed gold;\r\n      High to the topmost orchard branches climb\r\n      The apple-gatherers, and from each limb\r\n    Shake the ripe globes of sweetness, downward rolled\r\n      Upon the leaf-strewn ground; and all day long\r\n      From the near vineyard comes the merry song\r\n    Of those who prune the stocks and tread the press.\r\n      The spirit melts beneath the mastering sense\r\n      Of supreme beauty and beneficence,\r\n    Power divine and awful gentleness.\r\n\r\n    No space for sadness in the heart to-day,\r\n      Seeing the generous, faithful earth fulfill\r\n      The springtide promise of vine, field and hill\r\n    When bush and hedge were rosy-flushed with May.\r\n      Yet at the threshold of fruition fain\r\n      We pause to catch the savor once again\r\n    Of sweet expectancy. The perfect year\r\n      In fourfold beauty rounds itself at length,\r\n      With golden fullness of developed strength,\r\n    Into the sure, complete, unswerving sphere.\r\n\r\n    This the result of frozen winter-rains,\r\n      Of hard, white snows, of dull, loud-dripping thaw,\r\n      Of showers and shine of spring, of March blasts raw,\r\n    Of glaring August heats,--these dainty grains,\r\n      This fruitage delicate. O sluggard soul!\r\n      What harvest reapest thou as seasons roll?\r\n    Mayhap to thee the slow results of time\r\n      Bring also profit, though thy fruit, hung high,\r\n      Escape the glance of careless passers-by,\r\n    A seeming fragile husk of empty rhyme.\r\n\r\n    Yet there are those who know what fed the root,\r\n      What long, dull tedium as of wintry hours,\r\n      What rapture as of spring-light after showers,\r\n    Went to the ripening of this strange, frail fruit.\r\n      Defeat and hope, disaster, joy and pain,\r\n      Grief, pleasure and despair--the same old train\r\n    That follows every soul. No grafted seed,\r\n      No alien harvest this, but a true part\r\n      Of the whole being--soul and pulse and heart--\r\n    That from the living bough is lightly freed.\r\n\r\nEMMA LAZARUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORCO.\r\n\r\nFROM THE FRENCH OF GEORGE SAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were as usual assembled in the arbor. The evening was stormy, the air\r\nheavy and the sky charged with black clouds furrowed with frequent\r\nlightnings. We were keeping a melancholy silence, as if the gloom of the\r\natmosphere had reached our hearts, disposing us involuntarily to tears.\r\nBeppa, particularly, seemed given up to sorrowful thoughts. In vain had\r\nthe abbé, alarmed at the disposition of the company, tried several times\r\nand in every way to reanimate the gayety, usually so sparkling, of our\r\nfriend. Neither questions, teasing nor entreaties succeeded in drawing\r\nher from her reverie: her eyes fixed on the sky, her fingers wandering\r\ncarelessly over the trembling strings of her guitar, she seemed not to\r\nnotice what was going on around her, and to be thinking of nothing but\r\nthe plaintive sounds she caused her instrument to utter, and the\r\ncapricious course of the clouds.\r\n\r\nThe good Panorio, disheartened by the ill success of his attempts, took\r\nthe resolution of addressing himself to me. \"Come, dear Zorze,\" said he,\r\n\"try in thy turn the power of thy affection upon this capricious beauty.\r\nThere exists between you two a sort of magnetic sympathy stronger than\r\nall my reasoning, and the sound of thy voice succeeds in drawing her\r\nfrom her deepest distraction.\"\r\n\r\n\"This magnetic sympathy of which thou speakest to me,\" I answered,\r\n\"comes, dear abbé, from the identity of our feelings. We have suffered\r\nin the same way and thought the same things, and we know each other well\r\nenough, she and I, to know what sort of ideas external circumstances\r\nrecall to each. I wager that I can guess, not the subject, but at least\r\nthe nature, of her reverie.\" And turning toward Beppa, \"_Carissima_,\" I\r\nsaid gently, \"of which of our sisters art thou thinking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the most beautiful,\" she answered without turning round, \"of the\r\nproudest, the most unfortunate.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did she die?\" I continued, already interested in her who lived in\r\nthe memory of my noble friend, and desiring to associate myself by my\r\nregrets with a destiny which could not be strange to me.\r\n\r\n\"She died at the close of last winter, on the night of the ball at the\r\npalace Servilio. She had resisted many sorrows, she had come forth\r\nvictorious from many dangers, had suffered, without succumbing, terrible\r\nagonies, and died suddenly without leaving any trace, as if carried off\r\nby a thunderbolt. Every one here knew her more or less, but no one so\r\nwell as I, because none loved her so much, and she only let herself be\r\nknown according as she was loved. Others do not believe in her death,\r\nalthough she has not appeared since the night of which I tell thee: they\r\nsay it has often happened that she has disappeared thus for a long time,\r\nand returned again afterward. But _I_ know that she will never come\r\nback any more, and that her part upon the earth is finished. If I wished\r\nto doubt it I could not: she took care to let me know the fatal truth\r\nthrough him who was the cause of her death. And what a misfortune was\r\nthat! O God! the greatest misfortune of our unhappy age! Such a\r\nbeautiful life was hers! so beautiful and so full of contrasts! so\r\nillustrious, so mysterious, so sad, so magnificent, so enthusiastic, so\r\naustere, so voluptuous, so complete in its resemblance to all human\r\nthings! No: no life and no death were like hers. She had found means of\r\nsuppressing all the pitiful realities of her existence, leaving only its\r\npoetry. Faithful to the old customs of the national aristocracy, she\r\nonly showed herself after the close of the day, masked, but never\r\nfollowed by any one. There is not an inhabitant of the city who has not\r\nmet her wandering in the squares or in the streets--not one who has not\r\nnoticed her gondola moored in some canal, but no one ever saw it enter\r\nor go out. Although this gondola was watched by no one, it was never\r\nknown to have been the object of an attempt at theft. It was painted and\r\nequipped like all other gondolas, yet every one knew it. Even the\r\nchildren said, on seeing it, 'There is the gondola of the Mask.' As to\r\nthe way in which it moved, and the place from which it brought its\r\nmistress at night, and to which it carried her back in the morning, no\r\none could even suspect it. The revenue-cruisers had, indeed, often seen\r\na black shadow upon the lagoons, and, taking it for a contraband boat,\r\nhad given chase to it as far as the open sea, but when morning came they\r\nnever saw upon the waves anything resembling the object of their\r\npursuit; and finally they fell into the way of not minding it, and of\r\nsaying when they saw it, 'There is the gondola of the Mask again.'\r\n\r\n\"At night the Mask traversed the whole city, seeking no one knew what.\r\nShe was seen by turns in the broadest squares and in the most crooked\r\nstreets, on bridges and under the arches of tall palaces, in the most\r\nfrequented places and the most deserted. She went sometimes slowly,\r\nsometimes fast, without appearing to notice the crowd or the solitude,\r\nbut never stopping. She seemed to contemplate with passionate curiosity\r\nthe houses, the monuments, the canals, and even the sky above the city,\r\nand to breathe with delight the air which circulated through it. When\r\nshe met a friendly person, she signed to him to follow her, and soon\r\ndisappeared with him. More than once she has led me thus from the midst\r\nof the crowd, and has conversed with me of the things we loved. I\r\nfollowed her with confidence, for I knew we were friends; but many of\r\nthose to whom she signaled did not dare respond to her invitation.\r\nStrange stories circulated about her, and froze the courage of the most\r\nintrepid. It was said that several young men, thinking they discovered a\r\nwoman beneath this mask and this black dress, became enamored of her, as\r\nmuch for the singularity and mystery of her life as for her beautiful\r\nform and noble appearance--that having had the imprudence to follow her,\r\nthey had never reappeared. The police, having even noticed that these\r\nyoung men were all Austrians, had brought all their manoeuvres into\r\nuse to discover them, and get possession of her who was accused as the\r\ncause of their disappearance. But the _sbirri_ were not more fortunate\r\nthan the revenue-officers, and were never able to learn anything about\r\nthe young foreigners or to lay hands upon _her_. A strange incident had\r\ndiscouraged the most ardent spies of the Venetian Inquisition. Finding\r\nthat it was impossible to seize the Mask by night in Venice, two of the\r\nmost zealous of the police resolved to wait for her in her own gondola,\r\nso as to capture her when she should enter it to row away. One evening,\r\nwhen they saw it moored to the Quay dei Schiavi, they got into it and\r\nconcealed themselves. They remained there all night without hearing or\r\nseeing any one, but an hour before day they thought they perceived that\r\nsome one was untying the boat. They rose silently and prepared to fall\r\nupon their prey, but at the same instant a terrible push capsized the\r\ngondola and the unlucky agents of Austrian rule. One of them was\r\ndrowned, and the other only owed his life to aid brought him by the\r\nsmugglers. The next day there was no trace of the boat, and the police\r\nwere forced to believe it submerged, but in the evening it was seen\r\nmoored in the same place and in the same condition as the night before.\r\nThen a superstitious terror took possession of the police, and not one\r\nof them was willing to make the same attempt a second time. After that\r\nday they no longer sought to disturb the Mask, who continued her\r\nexcursions as in the past.\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning of last autumn there came to the garrison here an\r\nAustrian officer named Count Franz Lichtenstein. He was an enthusiastic,\r\npassionate young man, who had within him the germ of all great\r\nsentiments and an instinct for noble thoughts. In spite of his bad\r\neducation as a great lord, he had been able to preserve his mind from\r\nall prejudices, and to keep in his heart a reverence for liberty. His\r\nposition forced him to dissimulate in public his ideas and tastes, but\r\nas soon as his duties were performed he hastened to throw off his\r\nuniform, which seemed to him a badge of all the vices of the government\r\nhe served, and hurried to meet the friends whom his goodness and\r\nintelligence had procured for him in the city. We loved particularly to\r\nhear him speak of Venice. He had seen it as an artist, had deplored its\r\nservitude, and had come to love it as much as a Venetian. He never\r\nwearied of traversing it night and day, and of admiring it. He wished,\r\nhe said, to know it better than those whose good fortune it was to have\r\nbeen born there. In his nocturnal rambles he encountered the Mask. At\r\nfirst he paid no great attention to her, but having soon noticed that\r\nshe appeared to study the city with the same curiosity as himself, he\r\nwas struck with this strange coincidence, and spoke of it to several\r\npersons. They related to him the stories which were afloat concerning\r\nthe veiled woman, and advised him to beware of her. But, as he was brave\r\neven to rashness, these warnings, instead of frightening him, excited\r\nhis curiosity, and inspired him with a mad desire to make the\r\nacquaintance of the mysterious personage who so terrified the vulgar.\r\nWishing to keep toward the Mask the same incognito which she preserved\r\ntoward him, he dressed himself as a citizen and continued his nocturnal\r\nexcursions. He was not long in meeting what he sought. He saw under a\r\nbeautiful moonlight the masked woman standing before the charming church\r\nof Santi Giovanni e Paolo. She seemed to contemplate with adoration the\r\ndelicate ornaments which decorated its portal. The count silently and\r\nslowly approached her. She did not appear to notice him, and did not\r\nstir. The count, who had stopped a moment to see if he were discovered,\r\nmoved on again and came close to her. He heard her utter a profound\r\nsigh, and as he knew Venetian very badly, but Italian very well, he\r\naddressed her in pure Tuscan. 'Salutation,' said he--'salutation and\r\nhappiness to those who love Venice.'\r\n\r\n\"'Who are you?' replied the Mask, with a voice full and sonorous as a\r\nman's, but sweet as a nightingale's.\r\n\r\n\"'I am a lover of beauty.'\r\n\r\n\"'Are you one of those whose brutal love does violence to free beauty,\r\nor of those who kneel before captive beauty and weep for its sorrows?'\r\n\r\n\"'When the king of the night sees the rose flourish joyously beneath the\r\nbreath of the breeze, he flaps his wings and sings: when he sees her\r\nwither beneath the hurrying blast of the storm, he hides his head under\r\nhis wing and shudders. Thus does my love.'\r\n\r\n\"'Follow me, then, for thou art one of the faithful.' And grasping the\r\nyoung man's hand, she drew him toward the church. When he felt the cold\r\nhand of the unknown press his, and saw her move with him toward the\r\nsombre depth of the portal, involuntarily he recalled the fearful\r\nstories he had heard, and, seized with a sudden terror, he stopped. The\r\nMask turned, and fixing a scornful look on the pale face of her\r\ncompanion, said to him, 'You are afraid? Adieu.' Then loosing his arm\r\nshe hastened away.\r\n\r\n\"The count was ashamed of his weakness, and rushing after her, in his\r\nturn seized her hand, saying, 'No, I am not afraid. Come!' Without\r\nanswering, she continued her walk. But instead of going toward the\r\nchurch, as at first, she turned into one of the little streets which\r\nlead into the square. The moon was hidden, and the most complete\r\nobscurity reigned over the city. Franz hardly saw where he placed his\r\nfoot, and could distinguish nothing in the deep shadows which enfolded\r\nhim on all sides. He followed at random his guide, who seemed, on the\r\ncontrary, to know her way perfectly well. From time to time a few beams\r\ngliding across the clouds came to show Franz the edge of a canal, a\r\nbridge, an arch or some unknown part of a labyrinth of deep and tortuous\r\nstreets: then everything relapsed into darkness. Franz soon discovered\r\nthat he was lost in Venice, and that he was at the mercy of his guide,\r\nbut he resolved to brave everything. He showed no uneasiness, and let\r\nhimself be led along without making an observation.\r\n\r\n\"At the end of a full hour the masked woman stopped. 'It is well,' she\r\nsaid to the count: 'you have courage. If you had shown the least sign of\r\nfear during our walk, I would never have spoken to you again. But you\r\nwere calm: I am satisfied with you. To-morrow, then, on the square of\r\nSanti Giovanni e Paolo, at eleven o'clock. Do not seek to follow me: it\r\nwould be useless. Turn down this street to the right and you will see\r\nthe piazza of St. Mark's. Au revoir!' She quickly pressed the count's\r\nhand, and before he had time to answer disappeared behind the angle of\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n\"The count remained for some time motionless, still perfectly astounded\r\nat what had passed, and undecided what to do. But having reflected on\r\nhis slight chance of finding the mysterious lady again, and the risk he\r\nran of losing himself by pursuing her, he resolved to return home. He\r\nfollowed, therefore, the street to the right, found himself in a few\r\nmoments in the piazza of St. Mark's, and thence easily regained his\r\nhotel.\r\n\r\n\"The next day he was faithful to the rendezvous. He arrived in the\r\nsquare as the church-clock was striking eleven. He saw the masked woman\r\nstanding waiting for him on the steps of the entrance.\r\n\r\n\"'It is well,' said she. 'You are punctual: let us enter.' So speaking,\r\nshe turned immediately toward the church.\r\n\r\n\"Franz, who saw that the door was shut, and knew that it was never\r\nopened at night, thought the woman was mad. But what was his surprise at\r\nseeing the door yield to her first effort! He mechanically followed his\r\nguide, who quickly reclosed the door after he had entered. They then\r\nfound themselves in darkness, but Franz, remembering that a second door\r\nwithout a lock still separated them from the nave, felt no uneasiness,\r\nand prepared to push it before him in order to enter. But she stopped\r\nhim by a pressure of the arm. 'Have you ever come into this church?' she\r\nasked him abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"'Twenty times,' he answered. 'I know it as well as the architect who\r\nbuilt it.'\r\n\r\n\"'Say you think you know it, for you do not really know it yet. Enter!'\r\n\r\n\"Franz pushed the second door, and they penetrated into the interior of\r\nthe church. It was magnificently lighted on all sides, but completely\r\nempty.\r\n\r\n\"'What ceremony is to be performed here?' asked Franz, stupefied.\r\n\r\n\"'None: the church expected me to-night: that is all. Follow me.'\r\n\r\n\"The count vainly tried to understand the meaning of the words the Mask\r\naddressed to him, but, subjugated by a mysterious power, he followed her\r\nobediently. She led him into the middle of the church, made him notice,\r\nunderstand and admire its general architecture; then, passing to the\r\nexamination of each part, she explained to him in detail, by turns, the\r\nnave, the colonnades, the chapels, the altars, the statues, the\r\npictures, all the ornaments; showed him the meaning of everything,\r\ndisclosed to him the idea hidden beneath each form, made him feel all\r\nthe beauties of the works which composed the whole, and caused him to\r\npenetrate, so to speak, into the very entrails of the church. Franz\r\nlistened with religious attention to all the words of the eloquent mouth\r\nwhich was pleased to instruct him, and from minute to minute recognized\r\nhow little he had comprehended this ensemble of works which had seemed\r\nto him so easy to understand. When she finished the rays of morning,\r\npenetrating through the window-panes, caused the light of the tapers to\r\npale. Although she had spoken for several hours, and had not sat down\r\nfor an instant during the whole night, neither her voice nor her body\r\nbetrayed any fatigue. Only her head drooped upon her bosom, which was\r\nthrobbing violently, and seemed to listen to the sighs exhaling from it.\r\nSuddenly she lifted up her head, and raising her arms toward heaven,\r\ncried, 'O servitude! servitude!' At these words tears, rolling from\r\nbeneath her mask, fell among the folds of her black dress.\r\n\r\n\"'Why do you weep?' asked Franz, approaching her.\r\n\r\n\"'To-morrow,' she answered, 'at midnight, before the Arsenal;' and went\r\nout by the side door at the left, which closed again heavily. At the\r\nsame moment the Angelus sounded.\r\n\r\n\"Franz, astonished by the unexpected noise of the bell, turned and saw\r\nthat all the tapers were extinguished. He remained for some time\r\nmotionless from surprise, then left the church by the great door which\r\nthe sacristan had just opened, and returned slowly home, endeavoring to\r\nguess who this woman, so bold, so artistic, so powerful, with such charm\r\nin her speech, such majesty in her appearance, could be.\r\n\r\n\"The next night at midnight the count was before the Arsenal. He found\r\nthe Mask, who was waiting for him as on the previous night, and who,\r\nwithout saying anything, began to walk rapidly before him. Arrived\r\nbefore one of the side doors on the right, she stopped, inserted in the\r\nkeyhole a golden key, which Franz saw glitter in the moonbeams, opened\r\nthe door without making any noise, and entered first, signing to Franz\r\nto follow her. The latter hesitated an instant. To penetrate into the\r\nArsenal at night by the aid of a false key was to expose one's self to a\r\ntrial by a court-martial, if one were discovered; and it was almost\r\nimpossible to avoid discovery in a place guarded by sentinels. But\r\nseeing the Mask on the point of closing the door upon him, he suddenly\r\ndecided to pursue the adventure to the close, and entered. The masked\r\nwoman first led him across several courts, then through corridors and\r\ngalleries, all the doors of which she opened with her golden key, and\r\nended by bringing him into vast halls filled with arms of all kinds and\r\ntimes, which had served, in the wars of the republic, either its\r\ndefenders or its enemies. These halls were lighted by ships' lanterns\r\nplaced at equal distances between the trophies. She showed the count the\r\nmost curious and celebrated arms, telling him the names of those to whom\r\nthey had belonged and of the battles in which they had been used, and\r\nrelating to him in detail the exploits of which they had been the\r\ninstruments. Thus she revived before the eyes of Franz the whole history\r\nof Venice. After having visited the four halls consecrated to this\r\nexhibition, she led him into a last one, larger than all the others, and\r\nlighted like them, but containing wood for shipbuilding, the débris of\r\nvessels of different forms and sizes, and fragments of the last\r\nBucentaur. She told her companion the properties of these woods, the use\r\nof the ships, the time at which they had been built and the expeditions\r\nin which they had taken part: then pointing to the balcony of the\r\nBucentaur, 'There,' said she, in a sad voice, 'are the remains of a past\r\nroyalty. That was the last ship which bore a doge of Venice to wed the\r\nsea. Now Venice is a slave, and slaves never marry. O servitude!\r\nservitude!'\r\n\r\n\"As upon the previous evening, she went away after having pronounced\r\nthese words, but this time taking the count with her, as he could not,\r\nwithout danger, remain in the Arsenal. Arrived in the square, they\r\nagreed on a new rendezvous for the morrow and parted.\r\n\r\n\"The next night and many succeeding nights she took Franz to the\r\nprincipal monuments of the city, introducing him everywhere with\r\nincomprehensible facility, explaining to him with admirable lucidity\r\neverything presented to their view, displaying to him marvelous\r\ntreasures of intelligence and sensibility. He did not know which to\r\nadmire most, the mind that had investigated so deeply or the heart that\r\ndisplayed itself in such beautiful bursts of feeling. What had at first\r\nbeen with him only a fancy, soon changed to a real and profound\r\nsentiment. Curiosity had caused him to form a connection with the Mask,\r\nand astonishment had led him to continue it. But at length the habit\r\nwhich he had formed of seeing her every night became to him a veritable\r\nnecessity. Although the words of the unknown were always grave and often\r\nsad, Franz found in them an indefinable charm which attached him to her\r\nmore and more, and he could not have fallen asleep at the break of day\r\nif he had not at night heard her sighs and seen her tears. He had such a\r\nsincere and profound respect for the grandeur and sufferings of which he\r\nsuspected her that he had not dared beg her to take off her mask or to\r\ntell him her name. As she had not asked his, he would have blushed to\r\nshow himself more curious and less discreet than she; and he was\r\nresolved to hope everything from her good-will and nothing from his own\r\nimportunity. She seemed to appreciate the delicacy of his conduct, and\r\nto be pleased with it, for at each succeeding interview she showed him\r\nmore confidence and sympathy. Although not a single word of love had\r\nbeen uttered between them, Franz had reason to believe that she knew his\r\npassion and felt disposed to share it. His hopes almost sufficed for his\r\nhappiness, and when he felt a deeper desire to know her whom he already\r\nnamed internally his mistress, his imagination, impressed and as if\r\nassured by the marvels which surrounded him, painted her so perfect and\r\nso beautiful that he almost feared the moment in which she should be\r\nunveiled to him.\r\n\r\n\"One night, as they were wandering together under the arcades of St.\r\nMark's, the masked woman made Franz stop before a picture which\r\nrepresented a girl kneeling before the patron saint of the basilica and\r\nthe city. 'What do you think of this woman?' said she to him, after\r\nhaving given him time to examine it well.\r\n\r\n\"'It is,' he answered, 'the most wonderful beauty that one could, not\r\nsee, but imagine. The artist's inspired soul has been able to give us\r\nits image, but the model can only exist in heaven.'\r\n\r\n\"The masked woman warmly pressed the hand of Franz. 'I,' she replied,\r\n'know a face more beautiful than that of the glorious Saint Mark, and I\r\ncould love no other than that which is the living image of it.'\r\n\r\n\"On hearing these words Franz paled and trembled as if seized with\r\nvertigo. He had just perceived that the face of the saint offered the\r\nmost exact resemblance to his own. He fell on his knees before the\r\nunknown, and seizing her hand bathed it with his tears, without being\r\nable to utter a word.\r\n\r\n\"'I know now that thou belongest to me,' she said in a voice full of\r\nemotion, 'and that thou art worthy to know me and possess me. To-morrow,\r\nat the ball of the palace Servilio.' Then she left him as before, but\r\nwithout pronouncing the sacramental words, so to speak, which had\r\nterminated the conversation of each previous night.\r\n\r\n\"Intoxicated with joy, Franz wandered through the whole city, without\r\nbeing able to stop anywhere. He admired the sky, smiled upon the\r\nlagoons, saluted the houses and spoke to the wind. All who met him took\r\nhim for a madman, and singled him out by their glances. He perceived it,\r\nbut only laughed at the madness of those who found amusement in his.\r\nWhen his friends asked him what he had been doing for a month in which\r\nhe had not been visible, he answered, 'I am going to be happy,' and\r\npassed on.\r\n\r\n\"Evening having arrived, he bought a magnificent scarf and new\r\nepaulettes, returned home to dress, took the greatest pains with his\r\ntoilette, and then went, adorned with his uniform, to the palace\r\nServilio. The ball was magnificent: every one except the officers of the\r\ngarrison had come disguised, according to the injunction in the cards of\r\ninvitation; and this multitude of varied and elegant costumes, mingling\r\nand moving to the sound of a numerous orchestra, presented the most\r\nbrilliant and animated appearance. Franz traversed all the halls,\r\napproached all the groups and cast his eyes upon all the women. Several\r\nwere remarkably beautiful, but none seemed to him worthy to arrest his\r\nregard. 'She is not here,' he said to himself. 'I was sure of it: it is\r\nnot yet her hour.' He placed himself behind a column near the principal\r\nentrance and waited, his eyes fixed on the door. Many times it opened,\r\nmany women entered, without causing the heart of Franz to throb, but at\r\nthe moment when the clock struck eleven he started and cried out, loud\r\nenough to be heard by his neighbors, 'There she is!'\r\n\r\n\"All eyes turned toward him, as if to ask the meaning of his\r\nexclamation. But at the same moment the doors opened abruptly, and a\r\nwoman who entered attracted all attention toward herself. Franz\r\nrecognized her immediately. It was the young girl of the picture,\r\ndressed like a dogess of the fifteenth century, and rendered still more\r\nbeautiful by the magnificence of her costume. She advanced with a slow\r\nand majestic step, looking about her with assurance, and saluting\r\nnobody, as if she had been the queen of the ball. No one except Franz\r\nknew her, but every one, conquered by her marvelous beauty and her lofty\r\nair, stood respectfully aside, and almost bowed down before her passage.\r\nFranz, at once dazzled and enchanted, followed her at a sufficient\r\ndistance. At the moment she arrived in the last hall a handsome young\r\nman wearing the costume of Tasso was singing, accompanying himself on\r\nthe guitar, a romance in honor of Venice. She walked straight toward\r\nhim, and looking; fixedly at him asked him who he was that dared to wear\r\nsuch a costume and to sing of Venice. The young man, overwhelmed by her\r\nlook, turned pale, bent his head and handed her his guitar. She took it,\r\nand drawing her fingers, white as alabaster, across the strings, she\r\nintoned in her turn, with a harmonious and powerful voice, a strange and\r\nirregular song: 'Dance, laugh, sing, gay children of Venice! For you the\r\nwinter has no frosts, the night no shadows, life no cares. You are the\r\nhappy ones of the world, and Venice is the queen of nations. Who says\r\nNo? Take care: eyes see, ears hear, tongues speak. Fear the Council of\r\nTen if you are not good citizens. Good citizens dance, laugh and sing,\r\nbut do not speak. Dance, laugh, sing, gay children of Venice!--Venice,\r\nonly city not created by the hand, but by the mind, of man! thou who\r\nseemst made to serve as the passing dwelling of the souls of the just,\r\nplaced as a step for them from earth to heaven; walls which fairies\r\ninhabited, and which a magic breath still animates; aërial colonnades\r\nwhich tremble in the mist; light spires which one confounds with the\r\nfloating masts of ships; arcades which seem to contain a thousand voices\r\nto answer each passing voice; ye myriads of angels and saints, who seem\r\nto bound upon the cupolas and move your bronze and marble wings when the\r\nbreeze blows upon your damp brows; city which liest not, like others, on\r\na dark and filthy soil, but which floatest, like a troop of swans, upon\r\nthe waves,--rejoice, rejoice, rejoice! A new destiny is opening for you\r\nas beautiful as the first! The black eagle floats over the lion of St.\r\nMark's, and Teutonic feet waltz in the palaces of the doges. Be silent,\r\nharmony of the night! Die, insensate noises of the ball! Be no more\r\nheard, holy song of the fishermen! Cease to murmur, voice of the\r\nAdriatic! Pale lamp of the Madonna! hide thyself for ever, silver queen\r\nof the night! There are no more Venetians in Venice. Do we dream? are we\r\nat a fête? Yes, yes: let us dance, let us laugh, let us sing! It is the\r\nhour when Faliero's shade descends slowly the staircase of the Giants,\r\nand seats himself, immovable, upon the lowest step. Let us dance, let\r\nus laugh, let us sing, for presently the voice of the clock will say,\r\nMidnight! and the chorus of the dead will come to cry in our ears,\r\nServitude! servitude!'\r\n\r\n\"With these words she let fall the guitar, which gave forth a funereal\r\nsound on striking against the marble floor. Every one listened for the\r\ntwelve strokes in a horrible silence. Then the master of the palace\r\nadvanced toward the unknown with an air half terrified, half angry.\r\n'Madame,' said he in a troubled voice, 'who has done me the honor to\r\nbring you to my house?'\r\n\r\n\"'I,' cried Franz, advancing, 'and if any one finds it ill, let him\r\nspeak.'\r\n\r\n\"The unknown, who had appeared to pay no attention to the host's\r\nquestion, quickly raised her head on hearing the count's voice. 'I\r\nlive,' she cried with enthusiasm, 'I shall live!' and she turned toward\r\nhim with a radiant face. But as she looked at him her cheeks paled and\r\nher brow darkened with a sombre cloud. 'Why have you taken this\r\ndisguise?' she said in a severe tone, pointing to his uniform.\r\n\r\n\"'It is not a disguise,' he answered: 'it is--' He could say no more: a\r\nterrible look from the unknown had as if petrified him. She regarded him\r\nsome seconds in silence, then let fall from her eyes two large tears.\r\nFranz would have rushed toward her, but she did not give him time.\r\n\r\n\"'Follow me,' she said in a hollow voice: then rapidly breaking through\r\nthe astonished crowd, she left the hall, followed by Franz.\r\n\r\n\"Arrived at the foot of the palace steps, she leaped into her gondola,\r\nand told Franz to enter after her and be seated. When he had done so he\r\nlooked about him, and seeing no gondolier, 'Who will row us?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"'I,' she answered, seizing the oar with a vigorous hand.\r\n\r\n\"'Rather let me.'\r\n\r\n\"'No: Austrian hands do not know the oar of Venice;' and giving a\r\npowerful impulse to the gondola, she sent it like an arrow into the\r\ncanal. In a few moments they were far from the palace. Franz, who\r\nexpected from the unknown an explanation of her anger, was astonished\r\nand unhappy at seeing her keep silence. 'Where are we going?' he said\r\nafter a moment's reflection.\r\n\r\n\"'Where destiny wills us to go,' she replied in a terrible voice, and as\r\nif these words had reanimated her anger she began to row still more\r\nvigorously. The gondola, obeying the impulse of her powerful hand,\r\nseemed to fly over the water. Franz saw the foam dash with dazzling\r\nrapidity along the sides of the boat, and the ships on their course flee\r\nbehind them like clouds borne away by the whirlwind. Soon the darkness\r\ngrew deeper, the wind rose, and the young man heard nothing but the\r\nseething of the waves and the hissing of the air through his hair, and\r\nsaw nothing before him but the tall white figure of his companion in the\r\nmidst of the shadows. Standing at the stern, her hands on the oar, her\r\nhair scattered over her shoulders, and her long, white garments\r\nabandoned in disorder to the wind, she less resembled a woman than the\r\nspirit of shipwrecks playing upon the stormy sea.\r\n\r\n\"'Where are we?' cried Franz in an agitated voice.\r\n\r\n\"'The captain is afraid?' answered the unknown with a disdainful laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Franz did not reply. He felt that she was right, and that fear was\r\ngaining him. Not being able to master it, he wished at least to disguise\r\nit, and resolved to remain silent. But at the end of a few moments,\r\nseized with a sort of vertigo, he rose and walked toward the unknown.\r\n\r\n\"'Sit down!' she cried to him. 'Sit down!' she repeated in a furious\r\nvoice; and seeing that he continued to advance, she stamped with so much\r\nviolence that the boat trembled as if it would capsize. Franz was thrown\r\ndown by the shock, and fell fainting on the bottom of the boat. When he\r\ncame to himself he saw the unknown lying weeping at his feet. Touched by\r\nher bitter sorrow, and forgetting all that had just passed, he seized\r\nher in his arms, raised her up and made her sit by him; but she did not\r\ncease to weep.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, my love,' cried Franz, pressing her against his heart, 'why these\r\ntears?'\r\n\r\n\"'The Lion! the Lion!' she answered, raising toward heaven her arm white\r\nas marble.\r\n\r\n\"Franz raised his eyes to the part of the sky toward which she pointed,\r\nand saw indeed the constellation of the Lion shining solitary amid the\r\nclouds: 'What matters it? The planets have no power over our destinies,\r\nand if they had we would find favorable constellations to struggle\r\nagainst fatal stars.'\r\n\r\n\"'Venus is set, alas! and the Lion rises; and yonder, look yonder! Who\r\ncan struggle against what comes yonder?' She uttered these words in a\r\nsort of delirium, lowering her arms toward the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"Franz turned his eyes in the direction she designated, and saw a black\r\npoint traced upon the waves in the midst of an aureole of fire. 'What is\r\nthat?' he asked with profound astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"'It is destiny,' she answered, 'who comes to seek its victim. Which of\r\nus? thou wilt ask. Whichever I will. Thou hast heard of the Austrian\r\nnobles who came with me in my gondola, and were never seen again?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, but that story is false.'\r\n\r\n\"'It is true. I must devour or be devoured. Every man of thy nation who\r\nloves me, and whom I do not love, dies. As long as I do not love one, I\r\nshall live and I shall cause to die; and if I love one, I shall die: it\r\nis my fate.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, my God, who art thou, then?'\r\n\r\n\"'How it advances! In a minute it will be upon us! Dost thou hear? dost\r\nthou hear?' The black point had approached with inconceivable rapidity,\r\nand had taken the form of an immense boat. A red light came from its\r\nsides and surrounded it with flame: tall phantoms stood motionless on\r\nthe deck, and innumerable oars rose and fell in measure, striking the\r\nwater with a dreadful noise, while hollow voices chanted the _Dies Iræ_,\r\naccompanying themselves with the noise of chains.\r\n\r\n\"'O Life! O Life!' continued the unknown in a tone of despair. 'Oh,\r\nFranz, here is the ship: dost thou recognize it?'\r\n\r\n\"'No: I tremble before this terrible apparition, but I do not know it.'\r\n\r\n\"'It is the Bucentaur: it is that which engulfed thy countrymen. They\r\nwere here in this same place, at this same hour, seated by my side in\r\nthis gondola. The ship approached as it is approaching now: a voice\r\ncried to me, \"Who goes there?\" I answered, \"Austrian.\" The voice cried\r\nto me, \"Dost thou hate or love?\" I answered, \"I hate;\" and the voice\r\nsaid to me, \"Live!\" Then the ship passed over the gondola, engulfed thy\r\ncompatriots, and bore me in triumph on the waves.'\r\n\r\n\"'And to-day?'\r\n\r\n\"'Alas! the voice is going to speak.'\r\n\r\n\"In fact, a lugubrious and solemn voice, imposing silence on the\r\nfunereal equipage of the Bucentaur, cried, 'Who goes there?'\r\n\r\n\"'Austrian,' replied the trembling voice of the unknown.\r\n\r\n\"A chorus of malediction burst from the Bucentaur, which approached with\r\never-increasing rapidity. Then a new silence fell, and the voice\r\ncontinued, 'Dost thou hate or love?'\r\n\r\n\"The unknown hesitated a moment, then in a voice thrilling like thunder\r\nshe cried out, 'I love.'\r\n\r\n\"Then the voice said, 'Thou hast accomplished thy destiny--thou lovest\r\nAustria. Die, Venice!'\r\n\r\n\"A great cry, a heartrending, desperate cry, clove the air, and Franz\r\nsank in the waves. On coming to the surface he saw nothing--neither the\r\ngondola, the Bucentaur nor his beloved. Only on the horizon shone some\r\nlittle lights: they were the famous lanterns of the fishermen of Murano.\r\nHe swam in the direction of the little isle, and arrived there at the\r\nend of an hour. Poor Venice!\"\r\n\r\nBeppa had finished speaking: tears fell from her eyes. We watched them\r\nflow in silence without seeking to console her. But suddenly she dried\r\nthem, and said to us with her capricious vivacity, \"Well, what is the\r\nmatter with you that you are so sad? Is that the effect fairy-stories\r\nproduce upon you? Have you never heard of Orco, the Venetian Trilby?\r\nHave you never met her at evening in the churches or on the Lido? She is\r\na good devil, who only does harm to oppressors and traitors. One may say\r\nthat she is the real genius of Venice. But the viceroy, having heard\r\nindirectly and confusedly of Count Lichtenstein's perilous adventure,\r\nbegged the patriarch to pronounce a great exorcism over the lagoons, and\r\nsince then Orco has never reappeared.\"\r\n\r\nL. W. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE ISLE OF WIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Solent Sea, the channel dividing the Isle of Wight from the\r\nmainland, varies in breadth from one to six miles. The island must at\r\none time have formed a portion of the mainland, and so late as when the\r\nGreeks traded with Cornwall for tin the Solent is said to have been\r\npassable at low water by men and carts.\r\n\r\nThe circumference of the island is about sixty miles, the surface\r\nundulating, with a range of fine downs running through from east to\r\nwest, having here and there points of considerable elevation. It is said\r\nto have been well wooded formerly, but no forests remain, and the\r\nhedge-rows, coppices and scattered trees are all it can now offer in the\r\nway of foliage. The scenery of the north side of the island is quiet,\r\npleasing, here and there picturesque, but the southern side is full of\r\nthe beauty of bold cliffs, chasms, irregular coast- and hill-lines,\r\ntumbled rocks, bare, wind-swept hills, and sheltered coves where flowers\r\nbloom and ivy climbs from the very verge of the sea. On this side lies\r\nthe famous region known as the Undercliff--a series of terraces rising\r\nambitiously from the sea up the steep sides of St. Boniface's Down--the\r\ntract being about seven miles long, and from a quarter to half a mile\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the bold promontories, the shell-like bays of the\r\nsea-line; on the other, the lofty, rounded down, with here and there its\r\nbuttress of gray rock coming out in naked grandeur; between the two a\r\nlovely irregularity of soft slope, sinuous or dimple-like valleys, dark\r\nravines, velvet-smooth laps of terrace, with now and again a sudden\r\nspringing brook, and everywhere the thickets of holly and cedar\r\nclambered rampantly over by masses of ivy and traveler's joy--_our_\r\nVirgin's bower clematis--and such sunshine as falls not elsewhere in\r\nEngland over all.\r\n\r\nMiss Sewell, the author of _Amy Herbert, Ivors_ and _Ursula_, who\r\nresides at Bonchurch with her sisters, where they have a school, says of\r\nthe Undercliff: \"There is a verse spoken of a very different country\r\nwhich often comes to my mind when I think of it: 'It is a land which the\r\nLord thy God careth for. The eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon\r\nit, from the beginning of the year, even unto the end of the year.'\r\nSometimes it has even seemed to me that heaven itself can scarcely be\r\nmore beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Sir James Clark who discovered the Undercliff to the public. Up\r\nto the time of the publication of his work _On the Influence of Climate\r\nin the Prevention and Cure of Disease_, only a few fishermen's huts\r\nmarked the spot that is now populous Ventnor. But the sheltered, sunny\r\nspot, the soft air, the plants flourishing even in winter, the charming\r\nsurroundings, at once caught the fancy of invalids: they came in\r\nnumbers, both for a summer visit and a winter residence, and of course\r\nsuitable accommodation had to be provided for them. The \"plague of\r\nbuilding\" lighted on Ventnor: almost every possible and impossible spot\r\nhas been used for lodging--houses, hotels, shops, villas, churches,\r\nsituated with utter disregard to the natural lines of the place. The\r\nbuilding still goes on. There are everywhere ugly scars in the\r\nchalk-banks that Nature has not had time to heal: in short, Ventnor is\r\nspoiled for those who remember it in its early days, and for\r\naristocratic dwellers roundabout, but it is a case of the greatest good\r\nto the greatest number; and when the quick-springing green shall have\r\nkindly softened and folded in the crowded, incongruous buildings, and\r\nblended into rounded masses above them, Ventnor will be forgiven its\r\nrailway that has made this region accessible to the many-headed, in\r\nconsideration of the comforts and amenities of life brought to the doors\r\nof circumjacent dwellers, instead of being, as once, lacking, or brought\r\nlaboriously from London at serious individual expense.\r\n\r\nTo say that Ventnor is dull, to American notions, is only to say that it\r\nis an English sea-side resort. People live mostly in lodgings, which is\r\nthe most unsocial way possible of living: there are no reading-rooms, no\r\ncafés, no hops, no places of meeting and introduction. There is the\r\nrapprochement of proximity on the Esplanade and the bathing beach, where\r\none gets a little of his fellow-creatures in a sort of spiritual\r\nendosmose and exosmose. But nothing more, and I am afraid our average\r\nyouthful American specimen of Solomon's lilies would, at the end of two\r\ndays, cause all her crisp, snowy and varicolored petals to be refolded\r\nwithin their calyx \"ark,\" and indignantly withdraw herself for evermore\r\nfrom the \"Fair Island.\" \"Her own loss?\" Doubtless, but it is the race's\r\nas well that any single creature should be deaf, blind, without heart to\r\nfeel, intellect and culture to appreciate, or with any exquisite sense\r\nof apprehension wanting.\r\n\r\nBut there are Americans _and_ Americans; and some of our countrymen and\r\ncountrywomen who have been busiest at home, who have journeyed far and\r\nwide, seem to find it the most natural thing possible to linger for\r\nmonths in Capuan Ventnor--anywhere in the soft-aired, Sleepy-Hollow\r\nUndercliff; and to pluck themselves away from the sweet peace, the calm\r\ndelights of sauntering and lying on the cliffs, watching \"the wrinkled\r\nsea\" that \"beneath _them_ crawls,\" breathing the air that has no\r\nsuggestion of ocean in it save its freshness, so entirely is all odor of\r\nbrine and sea-weed overborne by the fragrance of flowers, notably that\r\nof the mignonette, sweet-pea and nasturtium, making little excursions on\r\nfoot or coach-top along the coast, or to the charming inland famous\r\nspots,--a thing very grievous to be borne patiently.\r\n\r\nJust above Ventnor, where the down is steepest, and almost at its top,\r\nis a wishing well; but if one would have his wish fulfilled, made while\r\ndrinking its waters, he must climb to the spring without casting one\r\nbackward glance. A sure foot and a head not easily dizzied are\r\nimperative necessities, and then one may climb, as I did, with\r\ncarefulest directions, scramble to the very brow and find no drop of\r\nwater on the way, get a superb view of the Undercliff and the Channel\r\nfor miles and miles, gather handfuls of the lovely heather that clothes\r\nthe down's top, then, plunging downward again, almost set foot unawares\r\nin the milky little basin no bigger than a kneading-bowl, that on the\r\nupward way would have been a very Kohinoor, and is now only glanced at\r\nwith spiteful aversion. The ancients were right: there _is_ a malignity\r\nof matter.\r\n\r\nAt Ventnor died John Sterling, made known to the world through the\r\nbiographies of Carlyle and Archdeacon Hare. He was buried in the\r\nchurchyard of the old church at Bonchurch, a tiny Norman building, of\r\ndate 1270, which has been for years deserted. Graves fill all the\r\nenclosure, ancient elms shade it, a noisy brook half winds about it,\r\nthen dashes down the sudden slope to the restless sea, whose mighty\r\nmurmur underlies the streamlet's plashes and gurgles and the ceaseless\r\ntender bird-notes, and makes for this little burial ground, that is\r\nonly hidden, not widely removed from men, a wondrous sense of space and\r\nsolemn solitude.\r\n\r\nBonchurch is perhaps a mile from Ventnor, and is the boskiest bit of\r\nloveliness in all the lovely island. By every approach you enter it\r\nunder the interlacing arches of noble old trees; ivy and ferns mask all\r\nwith tender and dark glossy green; the thatched cottages are masses of\r\nhoneysuckle and jessamine, their tiny windows and gardens gay with old\r\nEnglish flowers; you may stand beneath fuchsia trees so reddened with\r\nthe profusion of blossoms that at a little distance they are like\r\nnothing so much as tall clumps of barberry bushes laden with the ripe\r\nberries; you may visit, by introduction or permission, gardens of the\r\nlovely villas nestled in dells here, perched on bold crags there, or\r\nbacking against the abrupt gray cliff, which has here no turfy\r\ncovering--gardens such as one could well dream away life in, with no\r\nwish to range beyond their bounds, had one in this work-filled world no\r\nconscience about long dalliance in an earthly paradise. In one of these\r\ngardens I wandered long one afternoon that was not sunny, and that was\r\nyet not sombre, the air of balmiest breath, all the earth and sky\r\nsoftened with the changing, tender tones one finds not out of England.\r\nThe house was grandly placed against the cliff, and the garden, which\r\nwas rather a succession of gardens, was all up and down on the scattered\r\nterraces provided by long-ago landslips. There were modern gardens with\r\nbanks of color and mosaic parterres; old-fashioned gardens, clipt and\r\nquaint; a fernery brought bodily from Fairy-land; clematis, ivy,\r\nwoodbine and jessamine clambering and flowering against the wall of\r\ncrag, and fuchsias that seemed to have no foothold swinging long,\r\njewel-hung branches from far overhead. In one place, from a broad low\r\narch at the crag's base, a clear spring rushed forth. One could see some\r\nyards within the arch, discern rare ferns, a shimmer of ghostly lilies,\r\nand one vigorous tuft of maiden-hair that dropped a veil of tremulous\r\ngreen lace almost to the water's edge. Still, vines and vines, and in\r\nthis little garden of the grot what a magnificent growth of canes,\r\ncannas and pampas-grass; with walks now dropping into densest shade, now\r\nclimbing out upon a bare spur of rock or lap of smooth lawn; the musical\r\nrain of a fountain in the green depths below; the hamlet and neighboring\r\nvillas so lost to sight that the very birds might well doubt where to\r\npierce the leafy canopy to find home, wife and callow nestlings; beyond,\r\nand round all, the half ring of quiet-colored, placid sea--the emerald\r\nsea, rough with white caps; the blue sea, sparkling in sunshine; the\r\nmoonlit sea, silver-gleaming, but melancholy, and terrible as eternity.\r\n\r\nAt Bonchurch lived the parents of the poet Swinburne, but they left some\r\nyears since, because, it is affirmed, there was no church hereabouts\r\nsufficiently ritualistic to content their consciences. One cannot help\r\nthinking, with a little unmalicious amusement, what a cuckoo child the\r\npoet must have been to this pair. Here, too, lived a good old man and\r\nprolix poet, a friend of Tennyson. It is asserted, on authority, that\r\nthe laureate, in his visits to the family, sometimes found himself so\r\nintolerably bored by his fellow-craftsman that he was fain to betake\r\nhimself to a bathing-machine, dallying therein and over his bath for two\r\nor three hours to purchase the necessary respite.\r\n\r\nBeyond Bonchurch are three lions--\"the Landslip\" and the Luccombe and\r\nShanklin Chines. Many and many a rocky hillside pasture in New England\r\nis far finer than the Landslip, and the Chines (fissures or ravines--\"He\r\nthat in his day did chine the long-ribb'd Apennine,\" sings Dryden) are\r\nby no means impressive to American eyes. But the mixture of miniature\r\nwildernesses, tumbled rocks, stream, waterfall, airy little swells and\r\nfalls of ground, elegant villas, charming walks where all is beautiful,\r\nfinished, dainty, with incessant views of the really grand features of\r\nthe scene--the sea and the down--forms an enchanting combination. The\r\nauthoress who under the _nom-de-plume_ \"Holme Lee\" has done so much for\r\nthe readers of circulating libraries, resides at Shanklin, and here in\r\n1819 came Keats and tarried while writing _Lamia_.\r\n\r\nFrom Ventnor south-west through the Undercliff to St. Catherine's Hill,\r\nthe western bulwark of the Elysium of suave airs, the scenery is perhaps\r\neven finer to Western hemisphere taste than that of the more noted\r\nnorthern region. It is, if not wilder, more solitary, unimproved by art,\r\nless pervaded with tourists and tourists' needs: one feels less\r\nsuffocated, crowded, and very, very covetous of one or another of the\r\nlovely, lonely homes scattered here and there.\r\n\r\nOn this side of Ventnor is situated the National Consumptive Hospital\r\nprojected by Dr. Arthur Hill Hassall. It is on the cottage plan. There\r\nare to be sixteen cottages, each to contain about six patients. Several\r\nof the buildings are already completed and in use. The hospital is\r\npartly self-supporting, partly dependent upon voluntary aid, and in all\r\nthe places of resort one sees the little alms-box with its eloquent\r\nappeal, \"For I was sick, and ye visited me not.\"\r\n\r\nHigh up upon the hill above Ventnor is the seaside refuge of the London\r\ncity missionaries. The block of buildings was erected as a series of\r\nmodel cottages for laborers. Whether these found their intended homes\r\ntoo fine, too phalansterian, or what not, I cannot tell, but the group\r\nof houses was made over to the tired workers in the London slums, and\r\nthe laborers perch upon all sorts of inaccessible places upon the down,\r\nscratching great unsightly places in the chalk, erecting therein the\r\ntiniest houses of red brick; and though the one or two windows may be\r\nfilled with flowers, the ugly gashes do not heal quickly high on the\r\nwind-swept hill.\r\n\r\nThe longest, and certainly the most interesting, excursions to be made\r\nfrom Ventnor are those to Carisbrooke and to Freshwater. The first leads\r\nyou into the very heart of the island, through lanes that must be the\r\nboweriest in all England. Often the road-bed drops for a long way into a\r\ndeep cutting. Ivies cover all the sides, ferns, vetches, campions and\r\narums spring thickly amid them, and the tall, straggling hedges of\r\ndog-roses, brambles and hawthorn that top the banks are luxuriantly\r\noverrun with honeysuckle, filling the whole air with its spicy\r\nfragrance. On either side are blossoming fields of clover and beans, the\r\nlarks are mounting and singing in ecstasy overhead, the road climbs a\r\nsteep ascent, and we have miles and miles of finished landscape in view.\r\nThere are timber-tied farm-houses here and there, or tiny hamlets whose\r\nstraw thatches are simply glorious with their patches of velvet moss and\r\nthe brilliant golden blossoms of a succulent whose name I do not\r\nknow--houses and hamlets one would like to seize in one's arms and drop\r\nthem down in America, in the midst of New England's hideous\r\nfactory-villages, ornamentless, shadeless, unrestful, glaring with\r\nwhite-painted deal.\r\n\r\nFor the _interior_ of the old English cottages there is not one word of\r\ndefence to be uttered: the ugliest pine box of a house to be found\r\nanywhere in all the unlovely New England towns is more comfortable, more\r\nsanitary. The English cottage has a rheumatic floor of beaten earth or\r\ntile; its rooms are few and small, and very dark; the water-supply is\r\nscanty and most inconvenient; its chimney smokes; mice and rats find\r\nsecure refuge in the thatch; the masses of clinging vines make it damp\r\nand earwiggy; but what a lovely bit it is in the landscape!--the neutral\r\ntints, the patches of color, the picturesque outlines, the pitch and\r\ncurved border of its roof, the yellow ricks in the background, the\r\nlittle garden gorgeous with marigolds, wallflowers, stocks, pinks,\r\nbalsams, or white and pure with stately ranks of the beautiful Virgin\r\nlily. For the interior, away with it! but can we get no hint from all\r\nthe external beauty?\r\n\r\nOf Carisbrooke too much might be said for the scope and limits of this\r\npaper: brief mention must suffice. It is the old capital of the island.\r\nThe remains of a Roman villa were discovered about a dozen years since;\r\nthe old church dates from the time of William the Conqueror; and the\r\ngrand old castle, connected with almost every era of English history,\r\nhad for its nucleus a Saxon stronghold, which succeeded a Roman\r\nfortress, as that in turn succeeded a Celtic camp. The ruin covers a\r\nlarge space of ground on a hill overlooking the old town. There is no\r\nmajesty of beetling crags, no girdle of turbulent sea, but the dignity\r\nof its size, its age, its story, is all-satisfying. It is a good, a\r\nfitting spot for an American to make a pilgrimage to. A noble, eloquent,\r\npeaceful sadness pervades it, and generations shrink to dots. And Nature\r\nherself has had pity on these stones for the mirth, the heroism, the\r\nmisery they have encompassed: she has propped up the tottering ramparts\r\nwith forests of tall trees in the courts, balustraded the dizzy heights\r\nwith a sturdy, bushy growth of ivy, and firmly bound together all the\r\ncrumbling decay with a centuries-old cording of vine-stems.\r\n\r\nA mile from Carisbrooke village lies Newport, the modern capital of the\r\nisland--modern in its relation to Carisbrooke, but possessing some\r\ntraces that it was formerly of Roman occupation also. It is pleasantly\r\nsituated in a gentle valley, the temperature mild and damp like that of\r\nDevonshire, but is chiefly interesting to visitors for the attractions\r\nof the lovely region round about--stately Carisbrooke; Osborne, the\r\nroyal manor of Her Majesty, and not far from thence the birthplace of\r\nDr. Arnold; Godshill, a hamlet so beautiful one would like to wave over\r\nit an enchanter's wand that should fix for ever just the charm one sees\r\nin it to-day. The name of the village is accounted for by a tradition\r\nthat is not uncommon. The builders of the church proposed to erect it at\r\nthe foot of the hill, but each morning found the previous day's work\r\nundone and the materials carried to the top. After some days'\r\nperseverance they gave up the contest, and set up their beacon of the\r\nfaith on the spot indicated by their invisible combatants.\r\n\r\nNot far from Newport, by a way filled with delight, one reaches\r\nShorwell, a little village beautifully placed, and with a curious old\r\nchurch full of interest. Upon one of the walls is an old fresco\r\nillustrating the life and adventures of St. Christopher, and there is a\r\nquaint memorial brass erected by Barnabas Leigh in honor of his two\r\ndeceased wives, and with a flattering allusion to wife No. 3, then\r\nliving! One wife is followed by a troop of children--the other is\r\nforlornly alone. There is also a memorial to Sir John Leigh and his\r\ngrandson Barnabas, who died seven days after the grand-sire:\r\n\r\n    Inmate in grave he took his grandchild heire,\r\n    Whose soul did haste to make to him repaire;\r\n    And so to heaven along, as little page,\r\n    With him did poast to wait upon his age;\r\n\r\nand to Lady Elizabeth Leigh--\"Sixteene a maide, and fiftie yeares a\r\nwife.\"\r\n\r\nIn the opposite direction from Newport lies Arreton, where Legh Richmond\r\nfound the heroine of a narrative we have all read--_The Dairyman's\r\nDaughter_. Her memorial is in the churchyard, which is unusually full of\r\ninteresting inscriptions. Here is an early English one from a brass,\r\ndated 1430, within the church:\r\n\r\n    Here is yburied vnder this graue\r\n    Harry Hawles his soul God saue\r\n    Longe tyme steward of ye yle of Wyght\r\n    Have mercy on hym God ful of myght.\r\n\r\nLegh Richmond was curate of two near-by villages, Brading and Yaverland,\r\nduring the first years of the present century. Both villages are very\r\nold and full of interesting antiquities--churches, Jacobean manor- and\r\nfarm-houses, parish stocks, a bull-ring where our enlightened\r\nforefathers amused themselves savagely as well as sadly.\r\n\r\nThe excursion to Freshwater, twenty-two miles from Ventnor, is\r\nsufficiently charming when made on top of a coach in the veiled yet warm\r\nfriendliness of an English summer day; but the way of ways to make it,\r\nas indeed to see the whole island, is as a pedestrian. Freshwater is at\r\nthe extreme western point of the island. In going thither from Ventnor\r\none traverses all the western portion of the Undercliff, where every\r\nglimpse is a joy; then emerges into a wilder, solitary region, with a\r\nbold coast-line sharply indented with chines whose scenery varies from\r\nbeautiful to savage and drear; finds always the little hamlets--this\r\nwith its church, that with its inn, become a classic resort, another\r\nwith its story of an old hermitage or tradition of gold-laden galleon\r\nfoundered on its cruel rocks, the gold coins still now and then to be\r\nfound in certain sands. Here a landslip has exposed the remains of a\r\nRomano-British pottery; there is a down with Pictish tumuli, and at long\r\nintervals one of the old farm-houses which it is impossible not to\r\ngrudge to its possessor. The landscape has none of the exuberant\r\nluxuriance and variety of the Undercliff. Bare, lofty downs, shadeless\r\nfields, no coppices, great swampy pastures--an open, breezy country all\r\nswells and falls, with occasionally fine clumps and avenues of English\r\nelms, feathered to their roots. And so, at last, Freshwater, where downs\r\nare noblest, and the air, blown straight across the Atlantic, seems not\r\nless bracing and exhilarating than that of New England.\r\n\r\nThe old village of Freshwater is picturesque, but the new lodging-house\r\nportion, only lately sprung up because it has become a fashion with\r\ndoctors to prescribe Freshwater as a holiday and sanitary place, is\r\nhideous in its newness of fiery red brick and freshly uptorn earth.\r\n\r\nBut it was not for Freshwater, old or new; not for its church, which has\r\nsome very fine bits, and an epitaph celebrating \"the most virtuous Mrs.\r\nAnne Toppe, in her widowhood, by a memorable providence, preserved out\r\nof the flames of the Irish rebellion;\" not for the really superb\r\ncharacter of the coast-cliffs, just here mined into caverns only\r\naccessible from the sea, with huge detached masses of chalk, one\r\nhollowed into a grand arch, through which the waters rush with\r\nmagnificent music; not for \"the Needles,\" the extreme western points of\r\nthe middle range of downs, isolated masses of rock that are very fine\r\nseen from seaward, entering \"the Race\" between the Isle of Wight and\r\nDorset; not for Alum Bay, whose gay sands we have all seen fantastically\r\narranged in landscapes under glass, and whose cliffs have their\r\nvertical strata in brilliant stripes of deep, purplish-red, blue,\r\nyellow, gray that is almost white, and jet black, and contrast\r\ndelightfully with the snowy sides of \"the Needles;\"--not for any or all\r\nthe sublimity of sea and shore, did I make the pilgrimage to this\r\nout-of-the-way island corner. I went, as most lovers of our English\r\ntongue in its strength and poetry will go, because here for years was\r\nTennyson's home--the home wherein most of his poems have been\r\nwritten--Farringford,\r\n\r\n    Where, far from noise of smoke and town,\r\n    I watch the twilight falling brown\r\n      All round a careless-ordered garden,\r\n    Close to the ridge of a noble down.\r\n\r\n    You'll have no scandal while you dine,\r\n    But honest talk and wholesome wine,\r\n      And only hear the magpie gossip\r\n    Garrulous, under a roof of pine.\r\n\r\n    For groves of pine on either hand.\r\n    To break the blasts of winter, stand,\r\n      And farther on, the hoary Channel\r\n    Tumbles a breaker on chalk and sand.\r\n\r\nThe house is by no means beautiful, but it is in the midst of such a\r\nnetwork of peacefulest leafy lanes, the near-by surroundings are so\r\ngrand, the \"groves of pine\" and the \"careless-ordered garden\" look so\r\nutterly fitted to be haunted by a poet's step and musings, the whole\r\nplace must be so associated, so saturated with his reveries and fancies,\r\nso peopled with his creations, that it seems impossible any other spot\r\n_could_ be home to him; and one feels a great pang of sadness that the\r\nonly true master of Farringford should have felt himself driven to leave\r\nit, and to set up his household gods where he would be comparatively\r\nunknown and unhunted.\r\n\r\nAn un-famous person finds it however, a little difficult to sympathize\r\nwith Tennyson's overpowering horror of the troublesomely affectionate\r\ncuriosity of which he is the object. Even such extreme cases of\r\nhero-worship as that of the American who climbed the tree at Farringford\r\nto survey its master at his leisure, and that of the bevy of ladies at a\r\nLondon exhibition who, occupying a lounge before one of the special\r\npictures of the season, and beholding Tennyson approach for a look,\r\noverwhelmed him with discomfiture by impressively ceding to him the\r\nentire sofa,--even these, and others of their kind, have a humorous side\r\nthat might serve to qualify their impertinence and ill-breeding.\r\n\r\nNeither Browning nor George Eliot is unknown by sight to the reading\r\nworld of London: neither was Thackeray nor Dickens. Did either of these\r\never make outcry at the friendly if vulgar glances? Yet it is true that\r\nno one of them, save Dickens, has been so widely read, and it is\r\nprobable that Browning, who looks like nothing so much as a hale, hearty\r\nbusiness-man, oftenest escapes detection, while Tennyson's late\r\nphotograph reproduces him so faithfully that he declares he can go\r\nnowhere without being known. Of the mischievous fidelity of the picture\r\nI am myself a witness, for having driven up one day to the Victoria\r\nstation of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, by which\r\nTennyson's new home is reached, and being busied with extricating from\r\nmy purse the cabman's fare, my companion suddenly caught my arm, crying\r\nout, \"Oh, S----, there's Tennyson!\" The purse dropped in my lap: he was\r\nso near the cab I could have touched him, and of course he had heard the\r\nexclamation and knew why two ladies had so utterly forgotten their\r\nmanners; but if he had also known that one of us had a certain\r\nshabby-through-use edition of all his earlier poems, which during a\r\nspace of a dozen years had never been separated from her, traveling in a\r\ncrowded trunk for even the shortest absences from home--that for months\r\nof that time she had been used to read therefrom to a precocious child\r\nwho came every night in her night-gown to nestle in the reader's lap and\r\nlisten to the music without which she declined to undertake the business\r\nof sleep,--I think the look bestowed upon the absorbed twain might well\r\nhave been more amiable than the one which really fell upon them and\r\nblighted their innocent delight. It was all the photograph's fault, and,\r\nenthusiastic American sisters, be content with beholding the\r\nrepresentation, for the original looks neither more patient, more\r\ngracious, nor more hopeful. So sensitive is he to looks which have in\r\nthem any recognition, any stress, that a visitor at Farringford relates\r\nthat, wandering about the cliffs and shores with his host, the latter\r\nwould every now and then nervously cry out, \"Come! let's walk on--I hear\r\ntourists!\" and his companion, delaying a little, would be able to answer\r\nreassuringly, \"Oh no: see! there's nothing in sight but a flock of\r\nsheep.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought to confess that finding in one of the Farringford lanes\r\na lovely little green gate opening into one of the \"groves of pine,\" I\r\n_did_ just try the latch. The door opened, and it looked all so still\r\nand shaded, whispery and ferny, so exactly as if Tennyson might any\r\nminute come pacing down between the tall trees, as if the \"Talking Oak\"\r\nwas sure to stand just round a sun-lighted corner of the wood, that,\r\nincited thereto by a countrywoman of the poet's, who, herself a member\r\nof the guild, should know how poets' possessions may worthily be\r\napproached, I let my sacrilegious feet carry me a little way within that\r\nviolated enclosure. But it was only a very tiny raid we made. We stood\r\nquietly for two or three minutes, just _feeling_ the place, then\r\nscurried hastily away like two timorous hares; and as I have since lost\r\na much prized little fern-leaf plucked within the enclosure, I think Mr.\r\nTennyson should agree that this intrusive American has been quite\r\nseverely enough punished, and that much ought to be forgiven one who has\r\nloved so much.\r\n\r\nThere really is one spot in England where \"skies are blue and bright\"\r\nuniformly, and, in the Undercliff, where no harsh winds come. And the\r\nwhole island--with its smiling loveliness, its miniature sublimity, all\r\nits varying scenery, all its old landmarks, its rich story, its soft yet\r\nsparkling air, its dainty English culture, the sea that one never loses\r\nfor long--is a honeymoon paradise. It can have been intended for nothing\r\nelse. But it should be a pedestrian honeymoon. _They_ should come to\r\nRyde, leave all impedimenta to be sent forward to Ventnor by rail, and\r\nMadame in a serviceable walking-dress that need not be hideous, a\r\nsun-hat, with a strap holding her waterproof cloak, Monsieur with wraps,\r\na bag containing the indispensable toilet necessaries, an umbrella and\r\nguide-book, should set gayly forth on their enchanted way. What a month\r\nin the romantic byways, over hill, down dale, in the old churches,\r\nchurchyards, ivied ruins, through the ideal villages, resting amidst the\r\nheather on a down's summit, on the sands of a little scallop of a bay,\r\nstopping for food and sleep at the comfortable quaint inns or the\r\nsometimes \"swell\" hotels that are nowhere many miles asunder--seeing it,\r\nhaving it all together--the idyllic spot in the idyllic time!\r\n\r\nAnd to American invalids it seems to me the Undercliff is far less known\r\nas a winter resort than it deserves to be. It is perfectly sheltered,\r\nyet has none of the dampness of Torquay and most of the other\r\nsouth-of-England health-resorts. And to invalids who speak no language\r\nsave their own it must be infinitely pleasanter to abide where they hear\r\ntheir own tongue, where home comforts and home ways are joined to the\r\nother advantages they have come to seek. There is all the accessible\r\nbeauty of walk and drive, ever-changing aspects of sea, shore, sky and\r\ncrag, of which it would be difficult to tire, and a delicious languor in\r\nthe mental atmosphere inexpressibly soothing to worn brain and nerves.\r\n\r\nS. F. HOPKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thou art the last rose of the year,\r\n      By gusty breezes rudely fanned:\r\n    The dying Summer holds thee fast\r\n      In the hot hollow of her hand.\r\n\r\n    Thy face pales, as if looking back\r\n      Into the splendor of thy past\r\n    Had thrilled thee strangely, knowing that\r\n      This one long look must be the last.\r\n\r\n    Thine essence, that was heavenly sweet,\r\n      Has flown upon the tricksy air:\r\n    Fate's hand is on thee; drop thy leaves,\r\n      And go among the things that were.\r\n\r\n    Be must and mould, be trampled dust,\r\n      Be nothing that is fair to see:\r\n    One day, at least, of glorious life\r\n      Was thine of all eternity.\r\n\r\n    Be this a comfort: Crown and lyre,\r\n      And regal purple last not long:\r\n    Kings fall like leaves, but thy perfume\r\n      Strays through the years like royal song.\r\n\r\nJAMES MAURICE THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRINCESS OF THULE.\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM BLACK, AUTHOR OF \"THE STRANGE ADVENTURES OF A PHAETON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nA NEW DAY BREAKS.\r\n\r\nWas this, then, the end of the fair and beautiful romance that had\r\nsprung up and blossomed so hopefully in the remote and bleak island,\r\namid the silence of the hills and moors and the wild twilights of the\r\nNorth, and set round about, as it were, by the cold sea-winds and the\r\nsound of the Atlantic waves? Who could have fancied, looking at those\r\ntwo young folks as they wandered about the shores of the island, as they\r\nsailed on the still moonlight nights through the channels of Loch Roag,\r\nor as they sang together of an evening in the little parlor of the house\r\nat Borvabost, that all the delight and wonder of life then apparently\r\nopening out before them was so soon and so suddenly to collapse, leaving\r\nthem in outer darkness and despair? All their difficulties had been got\r\nover. From one side and from another they had received generous help,\r\nfriendly advice, self-sacrifice to start them on a path that seemed to\r\nbe strewn with sweet-smelling flowers. And here was the end--a wretched\r\ngirl, blinded and bewildered, flying from her husband's house and\r\nseeking refuge in the great world of London, careless whither she went.\r\n\r\nWhose was the fault? Which of them had been mistaken up there in the\r\nNorth, laying the way open for a bitter disappointment? Or had either of\r\nthem failed to carry out that unwritten contract entered into in the\r\nhalcyon period of courtship, by which two young people promise to be and\r\nremain to each other all that they then appeared?\r\n\r\nLavender, at least, had no right to complain. If the real Sheila turned\r\nout to be something different from the Sheila of his fancy, he had been\r\nabundantly warned that such would be the case. He had even accepted it\r\nas probable, and said that as the Sheila whom he might come to know must\r\ndoubtless be better than the Sheila whom he had imagined, there was\r\nlittle danger in store for either. He would love the true Sheila even\r\nbetter than the creature of his brain. Had he done so? He found beside\r\nhim this proud and sensitive Highland girl, full of generous impulses\r\nthat craved for the practical work of helping other people, longing,\r\nwith the desire of a caged bird, for the free winds and light of heaven,\r\nthe sight of hills and the sound of seas, and he could not understand\r\nwhy she should not conform to the usages of city life. He was\r\ndisappointed that she did not do so. The imaginative Sheila, who was to\r\nappear as a wonderful sea-princess in London drawing-rooms, had\r\ndisappeared now; and the real Sheila, who did not care to go with him\r\ninto that society which he loved or affected to love, he had not learned\r\nto know.\r\n\r\nAnd had she been mistaken in her estimate of Frank Lavender's character?\r\nAt the very moment of her leaving her husband's house, if she had been\r\nasked the question, she would have turned and proudly answered, \"No!\"\r\nShe had been disappointed--so grievously disappointed that her heart\r\nseemed to be breaking over it--but the manner in which Frank Lavender\r\nhad fallen away from all the promise he had given was due not to\r\nhimself, but to the influence of the society around him. Of that she was\r\nquite assured. He had shown himself careless, indifferent, inconsiderate\r\nto the verge of cruelty; but he was not, she had convinced herself,\r\nconsciously cruel, nor yet selfish, nor radically bad-hearted in any\r\nway. In her opinion, at least, he was courageously sincere, to the verge\r\nof shocking people who mistook his frankness for impudence. He was\r\nrecklessly generous: he would have given the coat off his back to a\r\nbeggar at the instigation of a sudden impulse, provided he could have\r\ngot into a cab before any of his friends saw him. He had rare abilities,\r\nand at times wildly ambitious dreams, not of his own glorification, but\r\nof what he would do to celebrate the beauty and the graces of the\r\nprincess whom he fancied he had married. It may seem hard of belief that\r\nthis man, judging him by his actions at this time, could have had\r\nanything of thorough self-forgetfulness and manliness in his nature. But\r\nwhen things were at their very worst, when he appeared to the world as a\r\nself-indulgent idler, careless of a noble woman's unbounded love; when\r\nhis indifference, or worse, had actually driven from his house a\r\nyoung wife who had especial claims on his forbearance and\r\nconsideration,--there were two people who still believed in Frank\r\nLavender. They were Sheila Mackenzie and Edward Ingram; and a man's wife\r\nand his oldest friend generally know something about his real nature,\r\nits besetting temptations, its weakness, its strength and its\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nOf course, Ingram was speedily made aware of all that had happened.\r\nLavender went home at the appointed hour to luncheon, accompanied by his\r\nthree acquaintances. He had met them accidentally in the forenoon, and\r\nas Mrs. Lorraine was most particular in her inquiries about Sheila, he\r\nthought he could not do better than ask her there and then, with her\r\nmother and Lord Arthur, to have luncheon at two. What followed on his\r\ncarrying the announcement to Sheila we know. He left the house, taking\r\nit for granted that there would be no trouble when he returned. Perhaps\r\nhe reproached himself for having spoken so sharply, but Sheila was\r\nreally very thoughtless in such matters. At two o'clock everything would\r\nbe right. Sheila must see how it would be impossible to introduce a\r\nyoung Highland serving-maid to two fastidious ladies and the son of a\r\ngreat Conservative peer.\r\n\r\nLavender met his three friends once more, and walked up to the house\r\nwith them, letting them in, indeed, with his own latch-key. Passing the\r\ndining-room, he saw that the table was laid there. This was well.\r\nSheila had been reasonable.\r\n\r\nThey went up stairs to the drawing-room. Sheila was not there. Lavender\r\nrang the bell, and bade the servant tell her mistress she was wanted.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Lavender has gone out, sir,\" said the servant.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed!\" he said, taking the matter quite coolly. \"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"A quarter of an hour ago, sir. She went out with the--the young lady\r\nwho came this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Let me know when luncheon is ready.\"\r\n\r\nLavender turned to his guests, feeling a little awkward, but appearing\r\nto treat the matter in a light and humorous way. He imagined that\r\nSheila, resenting what he had said, had resolved to take Mairi away and\r\nfind her lodgings elsewhere. Perhaps that might be done in time to let\r\nSheila come back to receive his guests.\r\n\r\nSheila did not appear, however, and luncheon was announced.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we may as well go down,\" said Lavender with a shrug of his\r\nshoulders. \"It is impossible to say when she may come back. She is such\r\na good-hearted creature that she would never think of herself or her own\r\naffairs in looking after this girl from Lewis.\"\r\n\r\nThey went down stairs and took their places at the table.\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" said Mrs. Lorraine, \"I think it is very unkind not to\r\nwait for poor Mrs. Lavender. She may come in dreadfully tired and\r\nhungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that would not vex her so much as the notion that you had waited on\r\nher account,\" said Sheila's husband with a smile; and Mrs. Lorraine was\r\npleased to hear him sometimes speak in a kindly way of the Highland girl\r\nwhom he had married.\r\n\r\nLavender's guests were going somewhere after luncheon, and he had half\r\npromised to go with them, Mrs. Lorraine stipulating that Sheila should\r\nbe induced to come also. But when luncheon was over and Sheila had not\r\nappeared, he changed his intention. He would remain at home. He saw his\r\nthree friends depart, and went into the study and lit a cigar.\r\n\r\nHow odd the place seemed! Sheila had left no instructions about the\r\nremoval of those barbaric decorations she had placed in the chamber; and\r\nhere, around him, seemed to be the walls of the old fashioned little\r\nroom at Borvabost, with its big shells, its peacocks' feathers, its\r\nskins and stuffed fish, and masses of crimson bell-heather. Was there\r\nnot, too, an odor of peat-smoke in the air?--and then his eye caught\r\nsight of the plate that still stood on the window-sill, with the ashes\r\nof the burned peat on it.\r\n\r\n\"The odd child she is!\" he thought with a smile, \"to go playing at\r\ngrotto-making, and trying to fancy she was up in Lewis again! I suppose\r\nshe would like to let her hair down again, and take off her shoes and\r\nstockings, and go wading along the sand in search of shellfish.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, somehow, his fancies went back to the old time when he had\r\nfirst seen and admired her wild ways, her fearless occupations by sea\r\nand shore, and the delight of active work that shone on her bright face\r\nand in her beautiful eyes. How lithe and handsome her figure used to be\r\nin that blue dress, when she stood in the middle of the boat, her head\r\nbent back, her arms upstretched and pulling at some rope or other, and\r\nall the fine color of exertion in the bloom of her cheeks! Then the\r\npride with which she saw her little vessel cutting through the\r\nwater!--how she tightened her lips with a joyous determination as the\r\nsheets were hauled close, and the gunwale of the small boat heeled over\r\nso that it almost touched the hissing and gurgling foam!--how she\r\nlaughed at Duncan's anxiety as she rounded some rocky point, and sent\r\nthe boat spinning into the clear and smooth waters of the bay! Perhaps,\r\nafter all, it was too bad to keep the poor child so long shut up in a\r\ncity. She was evidently longing for a breath of sea-air, and for some\r\nbrief dash of that brisk, fearless life on the sea-coast that she used\r\nto love. It was a happy life, after all; and he had himself enjoyed it\r\nwhen his hands and face got browned by the sun, when he grew to wonder\r\nhow any human being could wear black garments and drink foreign wines\r\nand smoke cigars at eighteenpence apiece, so long as frieze coats,\r\nwhisky and a brier-root pipe were procurable. How one slept up in that\r\nremote island, after all the laughing and drinking and singing of the\r\nevening were over! How sharp was the monition of hunger when the keen\r\nsea-air blew about your face on issuing out in the morning! and how\r\nfresh and cool and sweet was that early breeze, with the scent of\r\nSheila's flowers in it! Then the long, bright day at the river-side,\r\nwith the black pools rippling in the wind, and in the silence the rapid\r\nwhistle of the silken line through the air, with now and again the\r\n\"blob\" of a big salmon rising to a fly farther down the pool! Where was\r\nthere any rest like the rest of the mid-day luncheon, when Duncan had\r\nput the big fish, wrapped in rushes, under the shadow of the nearest\r\nrock, when you sat down on the warm heather and lit your pipe, and began\r\nto inquire where you had been bitten on hands and neck by the ferocious\r\n\"clegs\" while you were too busy in playing a fifteen-pounder to care?\r\nThen, perhaps, as you were sitting there in the warm sunlight, with all\r\nthe fresh scents of the moorland around, you would hear a light footstep\r\non the soft moss; and, turning round, here was Sheila herself, with a\r\nbright look in her pretty eyes, and a half blush on her cheek, and a\r\nfriendly inquiry as to the way the fish had been behaving. Then the\r\nbeautiful, strange, cool evenings on the shores of Loch Roag, with the\r\nwild, clear light still shining in the northern heavens, and the sound\r\nof the waves getting to be lonely and distant; or, still later, out in\r\nSheila's boat, with the great yellow moon rising up over Suainabhal and\r\nMealasabhal into a lambent vault of violet sky; a pathway of quivering\r\ngold lying across the loch; a mild radiance glittering here and there on\r\nthe spars of the small vessel, and out there the great Atlantic lying\r\nstill and distant as in a dream. As he sat in this little room and\r\nthought of all these things, he grew to think he had not acted quite\r\nfairly to Sheila. She was so fond of that beautiful island-life, and she\r\nhad not even visited the Lewis since her marriage. She should go now. He\r\nwould abandon the trip to the Tyrol, and as soon as arrangements could\r\nbe made they would together start for the North, and some day find\r\nthemselves going up the steep shore to Sheila's home, with the old King\r\nof Borva standing in the porch of the house, and endeavoring to conceal\r\nhis nervousness by swearing at Duncan's method of carrying the luggage.\r\n\r\nHad not Sheila's stratagem succeeded? That pretty trick of hers in\r\ndecorating the room so as to resemble the house at Borvabost had done\r\nall that she could have desired. But where was she?\r\n\r\nLavender rose hastily and looked at his watch. Then he rang the bell,\r\nand a servant appeared. \"Did not Mrs. Lavender say when she would\r\nreturn?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know where she went?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. The young lady's luggage was put into the cab, and they drove\r\naway without leaving any message.\"\r\n\r\nHe scarcely dared confess to himself what fears began to assail him. He\r\nwent up stairs to Sheila's room, and there everything appeared to be in\r\nits usual place, even to the smallest articles on the dressing-table.\r\nThey were all there, except one. That was a locket, too large and clumsy\r\nto be worn, which some one had given her years before she left Lewis,\r\nand in which her father's portrait had been somewhat rudely set. Just\r\nafter their marriage Lavender had taken out this portrait, touched it up\r\na bit into something of a better likeness, and put it back; and then she\r\nhad persuaded him to have a photograph of himself colored and placed on\r\nthe opposite side. This locket, open and showing both portraits, she had\r\nfixed on to a small stand, and in ordinary circumstances it always stood\r\non one side of her dressing-table. The stand was there, the locket was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nHe went down stairs again. The afternoon was drawing on. A servant came\r\nto ask him at what hour he wished to dine: he bade her wait till her\r\nmistress came home and consult her. Then he went out.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful, quiet afternoon, with a warm light from the west\r\nshining over the now yellowing trees of the squares and gardens. He\r\nwalked down toward Netting Hill Gate Station, endeavoring to convince\r\nhimself that he was not perturbed, and yet looking somewhat anxiously at\r\nthe cabs that passed. People were now coming out from their business in\r\nthe city by train and omnibus and hansom; and they seemed to be hurrying\r\nhome in very good spirits, as if they were sure of the welcome awaiting\r\nthem there. Now and again you would see a meeting--some demure young\r\nperson, who had been furtively watching the railway-station, suddenly\r\nshowing a brightness in her face as she went forward to shake hands with\r\nsome new arrival, and then tripping briskly away with him, her hand on\r\nhis arm. There were men carrying home fish in small bags, or baskets of\r\nfruit--presents to their wives, doubtless, from town. Occasionally an\r\nopen carriage would go by, containing one grave and elderly gentleman\r\nand a group of small girls--probably his daughters, who had gone into\r\nthe city to accompany their papa homeward. Why did these scenes and\r\nincidents, cheerful in themselves, seem to him to be somehow saddening\r\nas he walked vaguely on? He knew, at least, that there was little use in\r\nreturning home. There was no one in that silent house in the square. The\r\nrooms would be dark in the twilight. Probably dinner would be laid, with\r\nno one to sit down at the table. He wished Sheila had left word where\r\nshe was going.\r\n\r\nThen he bethought him of the way in which they had parted, and of the\r\nsense of fear that had struck him the moment he left the house, that\r\nafter all he had been too harsh with the child. Now, at least, he was\r\nready to apologize to her. If only he could see Sheila coming along in\r\none of those hansoms--if he could see, at any distance, the figure he\r\nknew so well walking toward him on the pavement--would he not instantly\r\nconfess to her, that he had been wrong, even grievously wrong, and beg\r\nher to forgive him? She should have it all her own way about going up to\r\nLewis. He would cast aside this society-life he had been living, and to\r\nplease her would go in for any sort of work or amusement of which she\r\napproved. He was so anxious, indeed, to put these virtuous resolutions\r\ninto force that he suddenly turned and walked rapidly back to the house,\r\nwith the wild hope that Sheila might have already come back.\r\n\r\nThe windows were dark, the curtains were yet drawn, and by this time the\r\nevening had come on and the lamps in the square had been lit. He let\r\nhimself into the house by his latch-key. He walked into all the rooms\r\nand up into Sheila's room: everything remained as he had left it. The\r\nwhite cloth glimmered in the dusk of the dining-room, and the light of\r\nthe lamp outside in the street touched here and there the angles of the\r\ncrystal and showed the pale colors of the glasses. The clock on the\r\nmantelpiece ticked in the silence. If Sheila had been lying dead in that\r\nsmall room up stairs, the house could not have appeared more silent and\r\nsolemn.\r\n\r\nHe could not bear this horrible solitude. He called one of the servants\r\nand left a message for Sheila, if she came in in the interval, that he\r\nwould be back at ten o'clock: then he went out, got into a hansom and\r\ndrove down to his club in St. James's street.\r\n\r\nMost of the men were dining: the other rooms were almost deserted. He\r\ndid not care to dine just then. He went into the library: it was\r\noccupied by an old gentleman who was fast asleep in an easy-chair. He\r\nwent into the billiard-rooms, in the vague hope that some exciting game\r\nmight be going on: there was not a soul in the place, the gases were\r\ndown, and an odor of stale smoke pervaded the dismal chambers. Should he\r\ngo to the theatre? His sitting there would be a mockery while this vague\r\nand terrible fear was present to his heart. Or go down to see Ingram,\r\nas had been his wont in previous hours of trouble? He dared not go near\r\nIngram without some more definite news about Sheila. In the end he went\r\nout into the open air, as if he were in danger of being stifled, and,\r\nwalking indeterminately on, found himself once more at his own house.\r\n\r\nThe place was still quite dark: he knew before entering that Sheila had\r\nnot returned, and he did not seem to be surprised. It was now long after\r\ntheir ordinary dinner-hour. When he went into the house he bade the\r\nservants light the gas and bring up dinner: he would himself sit down at\r\nthis solitary table, if only for the purpose of finding occupation and\r\npassing this terrible time of suspense.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to him, as it might have occurred to him at one time,\r\nthat Sheila had made some blunder somewhere and been unavoidably\r\ndetained. He did not think of any possible repetition of her adventures\r\nin Richmond Park. He was too conscious of the probable reason of\r\nSheila's remaining away from her own home; and yet from minute to minute\r\nhe fought with that consciousness, and sought to prove to himself that,\r\nafter all, she would soon be heard driving up to the door. He ate his\r\ndinner in silence, and then drew a chair up to the fire and lit a cigar.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life he was driven to go over the events that\r\nhad occurred since his marriage, and to ask himself how it had all come\r\nabout that Sheila and he were not as they once had been. He recalled the\r\nearly days of their friendship at Borva; the beautiful period of their\r\ncourtship; the appearance of the young wife in London, and the close\r\nrelegation of Sheila to the domestic affairs of the house, while he had\r\nchosen for himself other companions, other interests, other aims. There\r\nwas no attempt at self-justification in those communings, but an effort,\r\nsincere enough in its way, to understand how all this had happened. He\r\nsat and dreamed there before the warmth of the fire, with the slow and\r\nmonotonous ticking of the clock unconsciously acting on his brain. In\r\ntime the silence, the warmth, the monotonous sound produced their\r\nnatural effects, and he fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nHe awoke with a start. The small silver-toned bell on the mantelpiece\r\nhad struck the hour of twelve. He looked around, and knew that the evil\r\nhad come upon him, for Sheila had not returned, and all his most\r\ndreadful fears of that evening were confirmed. Sheila had gone away and\r\nleft him. Whither had she gone?\r\n\r\nNow there was no more indecision in his actions. He got his hat, plunged\r\ninto the cold night air, and, finding a hansom, bade the man drive as\r\nhard as he could go down to Sloane street. There was a light in Ingram's\r\nwindows, which were on the ground floor: he tapped with his stick on one\r\nof the panes--an old signal that had been in constant use when he and\r\nIngram were close companions and friends. Ingram came to the door and\r\nopened it: the light of a lamp glared in on his face. \"Hillo, Lavender!\"\r\nhe said in a tone of surprise.\r\n\r\nThe other could not speak, but he went into the house, and Ingram,\r\nshutting the door and following him, found that the man's face was\r\ndeadly pale.\r\n\r\n\"Sheila--\" he said, and stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what about her?\" said Ingram, keeping quite calm, but with wild\r\nfancies about some terrible accident almost stopping the pulsation of\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n\"Sheila has gone away.\"\r\n\r\nIngram did not seem to understand.\r\n\r\n\"Sheila has gone away, Ingram,\" said Lavender in an excited way. \"You\r\ndon't know anything about it? You don't know where she has gone? What am\r\nI to do, Ingram? how am I to find her? Good God! don't you understand\r\nwhat I tell you? And now it is past midnight, and my poor girl may be\r\nwandering about the streets!\"\r\n\r\nHe was walking up and down the room, paying almost no attention, in his\r\nexcitement, to the small, sallow-faced man who stood quite quiet, a\r\ntrifle afraid, perhaps, but with his heart full of a blaze of anger.\r\n\r\n\"She has gone away from your house?\" he said slowly. \"What made her do\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" said Lavender in a hurried way. \"I have acted like a brute to\r\nher--that is true enough. You needn't say anything to me, Ingram: I feel\r\nmyself far more guilty than anything you could say. You may heap\r\nreproaches on me afterward, but tell me. Ingram, what am I to do? You\r\nknow what a proud spirit she has: who can tell what she might do? She\r\nwouldn't go home--she would be too proud: she may have gone and drowned\r\nherself.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you don't control yourself and tell me what has happened, how am I\r\nto help you?\" said Ingram stiffly, and yet disposed somehow--perhaps for\r\nthe sake of Sheila, perhaps because he saw that the young man's\r\nself-embarrassment and distress were genuine enough--not to be too rough\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know, Mairi--\" said Lavender, still walking up and down the\r\nroom in an excited way. \"Sheila had got the girl up here without telling\r\nme, some friends of mine were coming home to luncheon, we had some\r\ndisagreement about Mairi being present, and then Sheila said something\r\nabout not remaining in the house if Mairi did not: something of that\r\nsort. I don't know what it was, but I know it was all my fault, and if\r\nshe has been driven from the house, I did it: that is true enough. And\r\nwhere do you think she has gone, Ingram? If I could only see her for\r\nthree minutes I would explain everything: I would tell her how sorry I\r\nam for everything that has happened, and she would see, when she went\r\nback, how everything would be right again. I had no idea she would go\r\naway. It was mere peevishness that made me object to Mairi meeting those\r\npeople; and I had no idea that Sheila would take it so much to heart.\r\nNow tell me what you think should be done, Ingram. All I want is to see\r\nher just for three minutes to tell her it was all a mistake, and that\r\nshe will never have to fear anything like that again.\"\r\n\r\nIngram heard him out, and said with some precision, \"Do you mean to say\r\nthat you fancy all this trouble is to be got over that way? Do you know\r\nso little of Sheila, after the time you have been married to her, as to\r\nimagine that she has taken this step out of some momentary caprice, and\r\nthat a few words of apology and promise will cause her to rescind it?\r\nYou must be crazed, Lavender, or else you are actually as ignorant of\r\nthe nature of that girl as you were up in the Highlands.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man seemed to calm down his excitement and impatience, but it\r\nwas because of a new fear that had struck him, and that was visible in\r\nhis face. \"Do you think she will never come back, Ingram?\" he said,\r\nlooking aghast.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know: she may not. At all events, you may be quite sure that,\r\nonce having resolved to leave your house, she is not to be pacified and\r\ncajoled by a few phrases and a promise of repentance on your part. That\r\nis quite sure. And what is quite as sure is this, that if you knew just\r\nnow where she was, the most foolish thing you could do would be to go\r\nand see her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I must go and see her--I must find her out, Ingram,\" he said\r\npassionately. \"I don't care what becomes of me. If she won't go back\r\nhome, so much the worse for me; but I _must_ find her out, and know that\r\nshe is safe. Think of it, Ingram! Perhaps she is walking about the\r\nstreets somewhere at this moment; and you know her proud spirit. If she\r\nwere to go near the river--\"\r\n\r\n\"She won't go near the river,\" said Ingram quietly, \"and she won't be\r\nwalking about the streets. She is either in the Scotch mail-train, going\r\nup to Glasgow, or else she has got some lodgings somewhere, along with\r\nMairi. Has she any money?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Lavender. And then he thought for a minute. \"There was some\r\nmoney her father gave her in case she might want it at a pinch: she may\r\nhave that--I hope she has that. I was to have given her money to-morrow\r\nmorning. But hadn't I better go to the police-stations, and see, just\r\nby way of precaution, that she has not been heard of? I may as well do\r\nthat as nothing. I could not go home to that empty house--I could not\r\nsleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sheila is a sensible girl: she is safe enough,\" said Ingram. \"And if\r\nyou don't care about going home, you may as well remain here. I can give\r\nyou a room up stairs when you want it. In the mean time, if you will\r\npull a chair to the table and calm yourself, and take it for granted\r\nthat you will soon be assured of Sheila's safety, I will tell you what I\r\nthink you should do. Here is a cigar to keep you occupied: there are\r\nwhisky and cold water back there if you like. You will do no good by\r\npunishing yourself in small matters, for your trouble is likely to be\r\nserious enough, I can tell you, before you get Sheila back, if ever you\r\nget her back. Take the chair with the cushion.\"\r\n\r\nIt was so like the old days when these two used to be companions! Many\r\nand many a time had the younger man come down to these lodgings, with\r\nall his troubles and wild impulses and pangs of contrition ready to be\r\nrevealed; and then Ingram, concealing the liking he had for the lad's\r\ngenerous waywardness, his brilliant and facile cleverness and his dashes\r\nof honest self-depreciation, would gravely lecture him and put him right\r\nand send him off comforted. Frank Lavender had changed much since then.\r\nThe handsome boy had grown into a man of the world; there was less\r\nself-revelation in his manner, and he was less sensitive to the opinions\r\nand criticisms of his old friend; but Ingram, who was not prone to\r\nidealism of any sort, had never ceased to believe that this change was\r\nbut superficial, and that, in different circumstances and with different\r\naims, Lavender might still fulfill the best promise of his youth.\r\n\r\n\"You have been a good friend to me, Ingram,\" he said with a hot blush,\r\n\"and I have treated you as badly as I have treated--By Jove! what a\r\nchance I had at one time!\"\r\n\r\nHe was looking back on all the fair pictures his imagination had drawn\r\nwhile yet Sheila and he were wandering about that island in the\r\nnorthern seas.\r\n\r\n\"You had,\" said Ingram decisively. \"At one time I thought you the most\r\nfortunate man in the world. There was nothing left for you to desire, so\r\nfar as I could see. You were young and strong, with plenty of good\r\nspirits and sufficient ability to earn yourself an honorable living, and\r\nyou had won the love of the most beautiful and best-hearted woman I have\r\nknown. You never seemed to me to know what that meant. Men marry\r\nwomen--there is no difficulty about that--and you can generally get an\r\namiable sort of person to become your wife and have a sort of affection\r\nfor you, and so on. But how many have bestowed on them the pure and\r\nexalted passion of a young and innocent girl, who is ready to worship\r\nwith all the fervor of a warmly imaginative and emotional nature the man\r\nshe has chosen to love? And suppose he is young too, and capable of\r\nunderstanding all the tender sentiments of a high-spirited, sensitive\r\nand loyal woman, and suppose that he fancies himself as much in love\r\nwith her as she with him? These conditions are not often fulfilled, I\r\ncan tell you. It is a happy fluke when they are. Many a day ago I told\r\nyou that you should consider yourself more fortunate than if you had\r\nbeen made an emperor; and indeed it seemed to me that you had everything\r\nin the shape of worldly happiness easily within your reach. How you came\r\nto kick away the ball from your feet--Well, God only knows. The thing is\r\ninconceivable to me. You are sitting here as you used to sit two or\r\nthree years ago, and in the interval you have had every chance in life;\r\nand now if you are not the most wretched man in London, you ought at\r\nleast to be the most ashamed and repentant.\"\r\n\r\nLavender's head was buried in his hands: he did not speak.\r\n\r\n\"And it is not only your own happiness you have destroyed. When you saw\r\nthat girl first she was as lighthearted and contented with her lot as\r\nany human being could be. From one week's end to the other not the\r\nslightest care disturbed her mind. And then, when she entrusted her\r\nwhole life to you--when she staked her faith in human nature on you, and\r\ngave you all the treasures of hope and reverence and love that lay in\r\nher pure and innocent soul--my God! what have you done with these? It is\r\nnot that you have shamed and insulted her as a wife, and driven her out\r\nof her home--there are other homes than yours where she would be welcome\r\na thousand times over--but you have destroyed her belief in everything\r\nshe had taught herself to trust, you have outraged the tenderest\r\nsentiments of her heart, you have killed her faith as well as ruined her\r\nlife. I talk plainly: I cannot do otherwise. If I help you now, don't\r\nimagine I condone what you have done: I would cut my right hand off\r\nfirst. For Sheila's sake I will try to help you.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped just then, however, and checked the indignation that had got\r\nthe better of his ordinarily restrained manner and curt speech. The man\r\nbefore him was crying bitterly, his face hidden in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Lavender,\" he said presently: \"I don't want to be hard on\r\nyou. I tell you plainly what I think of your conduct, so that no\r\ndelusions may exist between us. And I will say this for you, that the\r\nonly excuse you have--\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no excuse,\" said the other, sadly enough. \"I have no excuse,\r\nand I know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The only thing, then, you can say in mitigation of what you have done\r\nis that you never seem to have understood the girl whom you married. You\r\nstarted with giving her a fancy character when first you went to the\r\nLewis, and once you had got the bit in your teeth there was no stopping\r\nyou. If you seek now to get Sheila back to you, the best thing you can\r\ndo, I presume, would be to try to see her as she is, to win her regard\r\nthat way, to abandon that operatic business, and learn to know her as a\r\nthoroughly good woman, who has her own ways and notions about things,\r\nand who has a very definite character underlying that extreme gentleness\r\nwhich she fancies to be one of her duties. The child did her dead best\r\nto accommodate herself to your idea of her, and failed. When she would\r\nrather have been living a brisk and active life in the country or by the\r\nseaside, running wild about a hillside, or reading strange stories in\r\nthe evening, or nursing some fisherman's child that had got ill, you had\r\nher dragged into a sort of society with which she had no sympathy\r\nwhatever. And the odd thing to me is that you yourself seemed to be\r\nmaking an effort that way. You did not always devote yourself to\r\nfashionable life. Where are all the old ambitions you used to talk about\r\nin the very chair you are now sitting in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any hope of my getting Sheila back?\" he said, looking up at\r\nlast. There was a vague and bewildered look in his eyes. He seemed\r\nincapable of thinking of anything but that.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Ingram. \"But one thing is certain: you will never\r\nget her back to repeat the experiment that has just ended in this\r\ndesperate way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should not ask that,\" he said hurriedly--\"I should not ask that at\r\nall. If I could but see her for a moment, I would ask her to tell me\r\neverything she wanted, everything she demanded as conditions, and I\r\nwould obey her. I will promise to do everything that she wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you saw her you could give her nothing but promises,\" said Ingram.\r\n\"Now, what if you were to try to do what you know she wishes, and then\r\ngo to her?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--\" said Lavender, glancing up with another startled look on\r\nhis face. \"You don't mean that I am to remain away from her a long\r\ntime--go into banishment as it were--and then some day come back to\r\nSheila and beg her to forget all that happened long before?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean something very like that,\" said Ingram with composure. \"I don't\r\nknow that it would be successful. I have no means of ascertaining what\r\nSheila would think of such a project--whether she would think that she\r\ncould ever live with you again.\"\r\n\r\nLavender seemed fairly stunned by the possibility of Sheila's resolving\r\nnever to see him again; and began to recall what Ingram had many a time\r\nsaid about the strength of purpose she could show when occasion needed.\r\n\r\n\"If her faith in you is wholly destroyed, your case is hopeless. A woman\r\nmay cling to her belief in a man through good report and evil report,\r\nbut if she once loses it she never recovers it. But there is this hope\r\nfor you: I know very well that Sheila had a much more accurate notion of\r\nyou than ever you had of her; and I happen to know, also, that at the\r\nvery time when you were most deeply distressing her here in London she\r\nheld the firm conviction that your conduct toward her--your habits, your\r\nvery self--would alter if you could only be persuaded to get out of the\r\nlife you have been leading. That was true, at least, up to the time of\r\nyour leaving Brighton. She believed in you then. She believed that if\r\nyou were to cut society altogether, and go and live a useful and\r\nhardworking life somewhere, you would soon become once more the man she\r\nfell in love with up in Lewis. Perhaps she was mistaken: I don't say\r\nanything about it myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe terribly cool way in which Ingram talked--separating, defining,\r\nexhibiting, so that he and his companion should get as near as possible\r\nto what he believed to be the truth of the situation--was oddly in\r\ncontrast with the blind and passionate yearning of the other for some\r\nglimpse of hope. His whole nature seemed to go out in a cry to Sheila\r\nthat she would come back and give him a chance of atoning for the past.\r\nAt length he rose. He looked strangely haggard, and his eyes scarcely\r\nseemed to see the things around him. \"I must go home,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIngram saw that he merely wanted to get outside and walk about in order\r\nto find some relief from this anxiety and unrest, and said, \"You ought,\r\nI think, to stop here and go to bed. But if you would rather go home, I\r\nwill walk up with you if you like.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the two men went out the night-air smelt sweet and moist, for rain\r\nhad fallen, and the city trees were still dripping with the wet and\r\nrustling in the wind. The weather had changed suddenly, and now, in the\r\ndeep blue overhead, they knew the clouds were passing swiftly by. Was it\r\nthe coming light of the morning that seemed to give depth and richness\r\nto that dark-blue vault, while the pavements of the streets and the\r\nhouses grew vaguely distinct and gray? Suddenly, in turning the corner\r\ninto Piccadilly, they saw the moon appear in a rift of those passing\r\nclouds, but it was not the moonlight that shed this pale and wan\r\ngrayness down the lonely streets. It is just at this moment, when the\r\ndawn of the new day begins to tell, that a great city seems at its\r\ndeadest; and in the profound silence and amid the strange\r\ntransformations of the cold and growing light a man is thrown in upon\r\nhimself, and holds communion with himself, as though he and his own\r\nthoughts were all that was left in the world. Not a word passed between\r\nthe two men, and Lavender, keenly sensitive to all such impressions, and\r\nnow and again shivering slightly, either from cold or nervous\r\nexcitement, walked blindly along the deserted streets, seeing far other\r\nthings than the tall houses and the drooping trees and the growing light\r\nof the sky.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him at this moment that he was looking at Sheila's funeral.\r\nThere was a great stillness in that small house at Borvabost. There was\r\na boat--Sheila's own boat--down at the shore there, and there were two\r\nor three figures in black in it. The day was gray and rainy; the sea\r\nwashed along the melancholy shores; the far hills were hidden in mist.\r\nAnd now he saw some people come out of the house into the rain, and the\r\nbronzed and bearded men had oars with them, and on the crossed oars\r\nthere was a coffin placed. They went down the hillside. They put the\r\ncoffin in the stern of the boat, and in absolute silence, except for the\r\nwailing of the women, they pulled away down the dreary Loch Roag till\r\nthey came to the island where the burial-ground is. They carried the\r\ncoffin up to that small enclosure, with its rank grass growing green and\r\nthe rain falling on the rude stones and memorials. How often had he\r\nleaned on that low stone wall, and read the strange inscriptions in\r\nvarious tongues over the graves of mariners from distant countries who\r\nhad met with their death on this rocky coast! Had not Sheila herself\r\npointed out to him, with a sad air, how many of these memorials bore the\r\nwords \"who was drowned;\" and that, too, was the burden of the\r\nrudely-spelt legends beginning \"Hier rutt in Gott,\" or \"Her under hviler\r\nstovit,\" and sometimes ending with the pathetic \"Wunderschen ist unsre\r\nHoffnung.\" The fishermen brought the coffin to the newly-made grave, the\r\nwomen standing back a bit, old Scarlett MacDonald stroking Mairi's hair\r\nand bidding the girl control her frantic grief, though the old woman\r\nherself could hardly speak for her tears and her lamentations. He could\r\nread the words \"Sheila Mackenzie\" on the small silver plate: she had\r\nbeen taken away from all association with him and his name. And who was\r\nthis old man with the white hair and the white beard, whose hands were\r\ntightly clenched, and his lips firm, and a look as of death in the\r\nsunken and wild eyes? Mackenzie was gray a year before--\r\n\r\n\"Ingram,\" he said suddenly, and his voice startled his companion, \"do\r\nyou think it is possible to make Sheila happy again?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell?\" said Ingram.\r\n\r\n\"You used to know everything she could wish--everything she was thinking\r\nabout. If you find her out now, will you get to know? Will you see what\r\nI can do--not by asking her to come back, not by trying to get back my\r\nown happiness, but anything, it does not matter what it is, I can do for\r\nher? If she would rather not see me again, I will stay away. Will you\r\nask her, Ingram?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have got to find her first,\" said his companion.\r\n\r\n\"A young girl like that,\" said Lavender, taking no heed of the\r\nobjection, \"surely she cannot always be unhappy. She is so young and\r\nbeautiful, and takes so much interest in many things: surely she may\r\nhave a happy life.\"\r\n\r\n\"She might have had.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean with me,\" said Lavender, with his haggard face looking\r\nstill more haggard in the increasing light. \"I mean anything that can be\r\ndone--any way of life that will make her comfortable and contented\r\nagain--anything that I can do for that. Will you try to find it out,\r\nIngram?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I will,\" said the other, who had been thinking with much\r\nforeboding of all these possibilities ever since they left Sloane\r\nstreet, his only gleam of hope being a consciousness that this time at\r\nleast there could be no doubt of Frank Lavender's absolute sincerity, of\r\nhis remorse, and his almost morbid craving to make reparation if that\r\nwere still possible.\r\n\r\nThey reached the house at last. There was a dim orange-colored light\r\nshining in the passage. Lavender went on and threw open the door of the\r\nsmall room which Sheila had adorned, asking Ingram to follow him. How\r\nwild and strange this chamber looked, with the wan glare of the dawn\r\nshining in on its barbaric decorations from the sea-coast--on the shells\r\nand skins and feathers that Sheila had placed around! That white light\r\nof the morning was now shining everywhere into the silent and desolate\r\nhouse. Lavender found Ingram a bedroom, and then he turned away, not\r\nknowing what to do. He looked into Sheila's room: there were dresses,\r\nbits of finery and what not that he knew so well, but there was no light\r\nbreathing audible in the silent and empty chamber. He shut the door as\r\nreverently as though he were shutting it on the dead, and went down\r\nstairs and threw himself almost fainting with despair and fatigue on a\r\nsofa, while the world outside awoke to a new day with all its countless\r\nand joyous activities and duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nA SURPRISE.\r\n\r\nThere was no letter from Sheila in the morning; and Lavender, so soon as\r\nthe post had come and gone, went up to Ingram's room and woke him. \"I\r\nam sorry to disturb you, Ingram,\" he said, \"but I am going to Lewis. I\r\nshall catch the train to Glasgow at ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you want to get to Lewis for?\" said Ingram, starting up.\r\n\"Do you think Sheila would go straight back to her own people with all\r\nthis humiliation upon her? And supposing she is not there, how do you\r\npropose to meet old Mackenzie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not afraid of meeting any man,\" said Lavender: \"I want to know\r\nwhere Sheila is. And if I see Mackenzie, I can only tell him frankly\r\neverything that has happened. He is not likely to say anything of me\r\nhalf as bad as what I think of myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now listen,\" said Ingram, sitting up in bed, with his brown beard and\r\ngrayish hair in a considerably disheveled condition: \"Sheila may have\r\ngone home, but it isn't likely. If she has not, your taking the story up\r\nthere and spreading it abroad would prepare a great deal of pain for her\r\nwhen she might go back at some future time. But suppose you want to make\r\nsure that she has not gone to her father's house. She could not have got\r\ndown to Glasgow sooner than this morning by last night's train, you\r\nknow. It is to-morrow morning, not this morning, that the Stornoway\r\nsteamer starts; and she would be certain to go direct to it at the\r\nGlasgow Broomielaw, and go round the Mull of Cantyre, instead of\r\ncatching it up at Oban, because she knows the people in the boat, and\r\nshe and Mairi would be among friends. If you really want to know whether\r\nshe has gone north, perhaps you could do no better than run down to\r\nGlasgow to-day, and have a look at the boat that starts to-morrow\r\nmorning. I would go with you myself, but I can't escape the office\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\nLavender agreed to do this, and was about to go. But before he bade his\r\nfriend good-bye he lingered for a second or two in a hesitating way, and\r\nthen he said, \"Ingram, you were speaking the other night of your going\r\nup to Borva. If you should go--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I sha'n't go,\" said the other promptly. \"How could I face\r\nMackenzie when he began to ask me about Sheila? No, I cannot go to Borva\r\nwhile this affair remains in its present condition; and, indeed,\r\nLavender, I mean to stop in London till I see you out of your trouble\r\nsomehow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are heaping coals of fire on my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't look at it that way. If I can be of any help to you, I shall\r\nexpect, this time, to have a return for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you when we get to know something of Sheila's intentions.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so Frank Lavender found himself once more, as in the old times, in\r\nthe Euston Station, with the Scotch mail ready to start, and all manner\r\nof folks bustling about with that unnecessary activity which betokens\r\nthe excitement of a holiday. What a strange holiday was his! He got into\r\na smoking-carriage in order to be alone, and he looked out on the people\r\nwho were bidding their friends good-bye. Some of them were not very\r\npretty, many of them were ordinary, insignificant, commonplace-looking\r\nfolks, but it was clear that they had those about them who loved them\r\nand thought much of them. There was one man whom, in other\r\ncircumstances, Lavender would have dismissed with contempt as an\r\nexcellent specimen of the unmitigated cad. He wore a white waistcoat,\r\npurple gloves and a green sailor's knot with a diamond in it, and there\r\nwas a cheery, vacuous, smiling expression on his round face as he\r\nindustriously smoked a cheroot and made small jokes to the friends who\r\nhad come to see him off. One of them was a young woman, not very good\r\nlooking perhaps, who did not join in the general hilarity; and it\r\noccurred to Lavender that the jovial man with the cheroot was perhaps\r\ncracking his little jokes to keep up her spirits. At all events, he\r\ncalled her \"my good lass\" from time to time, and patted her on the\r\nshoulder, and was very kind to her. And when the guard came up and bade\r\neverybody get in, the man kissed the girl and shook hands with her and\r\nbade her good-bye; and then she, moved by some sudden impulse, caught\r\nhis face in both her hands and kissed him once on each cheek. It was a\r\nridiculous scene. People who wear green ties with diamond pins care\r\nnothing for decorum. And yet Lavender, when he averted his eyes from\r\nthis parting, could not help recalling what Ingram had been saying the\r\nnight before, and wondered whether this outrageous person, with his\r\nabominable decorations and his genial grin, might not be more fortunate\r\nthan many a great statesman or warrior or monarch.\r\n\r\nHe turned round to find the cad beside him; and presently the man, with\r\nan abounding good-nature, began to converse with him, and explained that\r\nit was 'igh 'oliday with him, for that he had got a pass to travel\r\nfirst-class as far as Carlisle. He hoped they would have a jolly time of\r\nit together. He explained the object of his journey in the frankest\r\npossible fashion, made a kindly little joke upon the hardship of parting\r\nwith one's sweetheart, said that a faint heart never won fair lady, and\r\nthat it was no good crying over spilt milk. She would be all right, and\r\nprecious glad to see him when he came back in three weeks' time, and he\r\nmeant to bring her a present that would be good for sore eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you're a married man, sir, and got past all them games?\" said\r\nthe cad cheerily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am married,\" said Lavender coldly.\r\n\r\n\"And you're going farther than Carlisle, you say, sir? I'll be sworn the\r\ngood lady is up somewhere in that direction, and she won't be\r\ndisappointed when she sees you--oh no! Scotch, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not Scotch,\" said Lavender curtly.\r\n\r\n\"And she?\"\r\n\r\nShould he have to throw the man out of the window? \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Scotch are a strange race--very,\" said the genial person, producing\r\na brandy flask. \"They drink a trifle, don't they? and yet they keep\r\ntheir wits about them if you've dealings with them. A very strange race\r\nof people, in my opinion--very. Know the story of the master who\r\nfancied his man was drunk? 'Donald, you're trunk,' says he. 'It's a tam\r\nlee,' says Donald. 'Donald, ye ken ye're trunk,' says the master. 'Ah\r\nken ah wish to Kott ah was!' says Donald. Good story, ain't it, sir?\"\r\n\r\nLavender had heard the remarkable old joke a hundred times, but just at\r\nthis moment there was something odd in this vulgar person suddenly\r\nimitating, and imitating very well, the Highland accent. Had he been\r\naway up in the North? or had he merely heard the story related by one\r\nwho had been? Lavender dared not ask, however, for fear of prolonging a\r\nconversation in which he had no wish to join. Indeed, to get rid of the\r\nman, he shoved a whole bundle of the morning papers into his hands.\r\n\r\n\"What's your opinion of politics at present, sir?\" observed his friend\r\nin an off-hand way.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any,\" said Lavender, compelled to take back one of the\r\nnewspapers and open it.\r\n\r\n\"I think, myself, they're in a bad state: that's my opinion. There ain't\r\na man among 'em who knows how to keep down those people: that's my\r\nopinion, sir. What do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I think so too,\" said Lavender. \"You'll find a good article in that\r\npaper on University Tests.\"\r\n\r\nThe cheery person looked rather blank. \"I would like to hear your\r\nopinion about 'em, sir,\" he said. \"It ain't much good reading only one\r\nside of a question, but when you can talk about it and discuss it,\r\nnow--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry I can't oblige you,\" said Lavender, goaded into making some\r\ndesperate effort to release himself. \"I am suffering from relaxed throat\r\nat present. My doctor has warned me against talking too much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, sir. You don't seem very well: perhaps the throat\r\ncomes with a little feverishness, you see--a cold, in fact. Now if I was\r\nyou I'd try tannin lozenges for the throat. They're uncommon good for\r\nthe throat; and a little quinine for the general system--that would put\r\nyou as right as a fiver. I tried it myself when I was down in 'Ampshire\r\nlast year. And you wouldn't find a drop of this brandy a bad thing,\r\neither, if you don't mind rowing in the same boat as myself.\"\r\n\r\nLavender declined the proffered flask and subsided behind a newspaper.\r\nHis fellow-traveler lit another cheroot, took up Bradshaw and settled\r\nhimself in a corner.\r\n\r\nHad Sheila come up this very line some dozen hours before? Lavender\r\nasked himself as he looked out on the hills and valleys and woods of\r\nBuckinghamshire. Had the throbbing of the engine and the rattle of the\r\nwheels kept the piteous eyes awake all through the dark night, until the\r\npale dawn showed the girl a wild vision of northern hills and moors,\r\ntelling her she was getting near to her own country? Not thus had Sheila\r\nproposed to herself to return home on the first holiday-time that should\r\noccur to them both. He began to think of his present journey as it might\r\nhave been in other circumstances. Would she have remembered any of those\r\npretty villages which she saw one early morning long ago when they were\r\nbathed in sunshine and scarcely awake to the new day? Would she be\r\nimpatient at the delays at the stations, and anxious to hurry on to\r\nWestmoreland and Dumfries, to Glasgow, and Oban, and Skye, and then from\r\nStornoway across the island to the little inn at Garra-na-hina? Here, as\r\nhe looked out of the window, the first indication of the wilder country\r\nbecame visible in the distant Berkshire hills. Close at hand the country\r\nlay green and bright under a brilliant sun, but over there in the east\r\nsome heavy clouds darkened the landscape, and the far hills seemed to be\r\nplaced amid a gloomy stretch of moorland. Would not Sheila have been\r\nthrilled by this glimpse of the coming North? She would have fancied\r\nthat greater mountains lay far behind these rounded slopes hidden in\r\nmist. She would have imagined that no human habitations were near those\r\nrising plains of sombre hue, where the red-deer and the fox ought to\r\ndwell. And in her delight at getting away from the fancied brightness\r\nof the South, would she not have been exceptionally grateful and\r\naffectionate toward himself, and striven to please him with her tender\r\nways?\r\n\r\nIt was not a cheerful journey, this lonely trip to the North. Lavender\r\ngot to Glasgow that night, and next morning he went down, long before\r\nany passengers could have thought of arriving, to the Clansman. He did\r\nnot go near the big steamer, for he was known to the captain and the\r\nsteward, but he hung about the quays, watching each person who went on\r\nboard. Sheila certainly was not among the passengers by the Clansman.\r\n\r\nBut she might have gone to Greenock and waited for the steamer there.\r\nAccordingly, after the Clansman had started on her voyage, he went into\r\na neighboring hotel and had some breakfast, after which he crossed the\r\nbridge to the station and took rail for Greenock, where he arrived some\r\ntime before the Clansman made her appearance. He went down to the quay.\r\nIt was yet early morning, and a cool fresh breeze was blowing in across\r\nthe broad waters of the Frith, where the sunlight was shining on the\r\nwhite sails of the yachts and on the dipping and screaming sea gulls.\r\nFar away beyond the pale blue mountains opposite lay the wonderful\r\nnetwork of sea-loch and island through which one had to pass to get to\r\nthe distant Lewis. How gladly at this moment would he have stepped on\r\nboard the steamer with Sheila, and put out on that gleaming plain of\r\nsea, knowing that by and by they would sail into Stornoway harbor and\r\nfind the wagonette there! They would not hasten the voyage. She had\r\nnever been round the Mull of Cantyre, and so he would sit by her side\r\nand show her the wild tides meeting there, and the long jets of white\r\nfoam shooting up the great wall of rock. He would show her the pale\r\ncoast of Ireland; and then they would see Islay, of which she had many a\r\nballad and story. They would go through the narrow sound that is\r\noverlooked by the gloomy mountains of Jura. They would see the distant\r\nislands where the chief of Colonsay is still mourned for on the still\r\nevenings by the hapless mermaiden, who sings her wild song across the\r\nsea. They would keep wide of the dangerous currents of Corryvreckan, and\r\nby and by they would sail into the harbor of Oban, the beautiful\r\nsea-town where Sheila first got a notion of the greatness of the world\r\nlying outside of her native island.\r\n\r\nWhat if she were to come down now from this busy little seaport, which\r\nlay under a pale blue smoke, and come out upon this pier to meet the\r\nfree sunlight and the fresh sea-air blowing all about? Surely at a great\r\ndistance he could recognize the proud, light step, and the proud, sad\r\nface. Would she speak to him, or go past him, with firm lips and piteous\r\neyes, to wait for the great steamer that was now coming along out of the\r\neastern mist? Lavender glanced vaguely around the quays and the\r\nthoroughfares leading to them, but there was no one like Sheila there.\r\nIn the distance he could hear the throbbing of the Clansman's engines as\r\nthe big steamer came on through the white plain. The sun was warmer now\r\non the bright waters of the Frith, and the distant haze over the pale\r\nblue mountains beyond had grown more luminous. Small boats went by, and\r\nhere and there a yachtsman, scarlet-capped and in white costume, was\r\ntaking a leisurely breakfast on his deck. The sea-gulls circled about,\r\nor dipped down on the waters, or chased each other with screams and\r\ncries. Then the Clansman sailed into the quay, and there was a flinging\r\nof ropes and general hurry and bustle, while people came crowding round\r\nthe gangways, calling out to each other in every variety of dialect and\r\naccent.\r\n\r\nSheila was not there. He lingered about, and patiently waited for the\r\nstarting of the steamer, not knowing how long she ordinarily remained at\r\nGreenock. He was in no hurry, indeed, for after the vessel had gone he\r\nfound himself with a whole day before him, and with no fixed notion as\r\nto how it could be passed.\r\n\r\nIn other circumstances he would have been in no difficulty as to the\r\nspending of a bright forenoon and afternoon by the side of the sea. Or\r\nhe could have run through to Edinburgh and called on some artist-friends\r\nthere. Or he could have crossed the Frith and had a day's ramble among\r\nthe mountains. But now that he was satisfied that Sheila had not gone\r\nhome all his fancies and hopes went back to London. She was in London.\r\nAnd while he was glad that she had not gone straight to her own people\r\nwith a revelation of her wrongs, he scarcely dared speculate on what\r\nadventures and experiences might have befallen those two girls turned\r\nout into a great city of which they were about equally ignorant.\r\n\r\nThe day passed somehow, and at night he was on his way to London. Next\r\nmorning he went down to Whitehall and saw Ingram.\r\n\r\n\"Sheila has not gone back to the Highlands, so far as I can make out,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"So much the better,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"What am I to do? She must be in London, and who knows what may befall\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you what you should do. Of course you would like to know\r\nwhere she is; and I fancy she would have no objection herself to letting\r\nyou know that she was all right, so long as she knew that you would not\r\ngo near her. I don't think she has taken so decided a step merely for\r\nthe purpose of being coaxed back again: that is not Sheila's way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't go near her,\" he said. \"I only want to know that she is safe\r\nand well. I will do whatever she likes, but I must know where she is,\r\nand that she has come to no harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Ingram slowly, \"I was talking the matter over with Mrs.\r\nLorraine last night--\"\r\n\r\n\"Does _she_ know?\" said Lavender, wincing somewhat.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" Ingram answered. \"I did not tell her. I had promised to go\r\nup there about something quite different, when she immediately began to\r\ntell me the news. Of course it was impossible to conceal such a thing.\r\nDon't all the servants about know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care who knows,\" said Lavender moodily. \"What does Mrs.\r\nLorraine say about this affair?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Lorraine says that it serves you right,\" said Ingram bluntly.\r\n\r\n\"Thank her very much! I like candor, especially in a fair-weather\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Lorraine is a better friend to you than you imagine,\" Ingram said,\r\ntaking no notice of the sneer. \"When she thought that your going to\r\ntheir house continually was annoying Sheila, she tried to put a stop to\r\nit for Sheila's sake. And now, at this very moment, she is doing her\r\nvery best to find out where Sheila is; and if she succeeds she means to\r\ngo and plead your cause with the girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not have her do anything of the kind,\" said Lavender fiercely.\r\n\"I will plead my own cause with Sheila. I will have forgiveness from\r\nSheila herself alone--not brought to me by any intermeddling woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't call names,\" said Ingram coolly. \"But I confess I think you\r\nare right; and I told Mrs. Lorraine that was what you would doubtless\r\nsay. In any case, she can do no harm in trying to find out where Sheila\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how does she propose to succeed? Pollaky, the 'Agony' column,\r\nplacards, or a bellman? I tell you, Ingram, I won't have that woman\r\nmeddle in my affairs--coming forward as a Sister of Mercy to heal the\r\nwounded, bestowing mock compassion, and laughing all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lavender, you are beside yourself. That woman is one of the most\r\ngood-natured, shrewd, clever and amiable women I have ever met. What has\r\nenraged you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! She has got hold of you too, has she? I tell you she is a rank\r\nimpostor.\"\r\n\r\n\"An impostor!\" said Ingram slowly. \"I have heard a good many people\r\ncalled impostors. Did it ever occur to you that the blame of the\r\nimposture might possibly lie with the person imposed on? I have heard of\r\npeople falling into the delusion that a certain modest and\r\nsimple-minded man was a great politician or a great wit, although he had\r\nnever claimed to be anything of the kind; and then, when they found out\r\nthat in truth he was just what he had pretended to be, they called out\r\nagainst him as an impostor. I have heard, too, of young gentlemen\r\naccusing women of imposture whose only crime was that they did not\r\npossess qualities which they had never pretended to possess, but which\r\nthe young gentlemen fancied they ought to possess. Mrs. Lorraine may be\r\nan impostor to you. I think she is a thoroughly good woman, and I know\r\nshe is a very delightful companion. And if you want to know how she\r\nmeans to find Sheila out, I can tell you. She thinks that Sheila would\r\nprobably go to a hotel, but that afterward she would try to find\r\nlodgings with some of the people whom she had got to know through her\r\ngiving them assistance. Mrs. Lorraine would like to ask your servants\r\nabout the women who used to come for this help. Then, she thinks, Sheila\r\nwould probably get some one of these humble friends to call for her\r\nletters, for she would like to hear from her father, and she would not\r\ncare to tell him that she had left your house. There is a great deal of\r\nsupposition in all this, but Mrs. Lorraine is a shrewd woman, and I\r\nwould trust her instinct in such matters a long way. She is quite sure\r\nthat Sheila would be too proud to tell her father, and very much averse,\r\nalso, to inflicting so severe a blow on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely,\" Lavender said hastily, \"if Sheila wishes to conceal this\r\naffair for a time, she must believe it to be only temporary? She cannot\r\npropose to make the separation final?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I don't know anything about. I would advise you to go and see Mrs.\r\nLorraine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't go and see Mrs. Lorraine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, this is unreasonable, Lavender. You begin to fancy that Sheila had\r\nsome sort of dislike to Mrs. Lorraine, founded on ignorance, and\r\nstraightway you think it is your duty to go and hate the woman. Whatever\r\nyou may think of her, she is willing to do you a service.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you go, Ingram, and take her to those servants?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I will, if you commission me to do so,\" said Ingram readily.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose they all know?\"\r\n\r\n\"They do.\"\r\n\r\n\"And every one else?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think few of your friends would remain in ignorance of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well,\" said Lavender, \"if only I could get Sheila to overlook what\r\nis past, this once, I should not trouble my dear friends and\r\nacquaintances for their sympathy and condolence. By the time I saw them\r\nagain I fancy they would have forgotten our names.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt of the fact that the news of Sheila's flight from her\r\nhusband's house had traveled very speedily round the circle of\r\nLavender's friends, and doubtless in due time it reached the ears of his\r\naunt. At all events, Mrs. Lavender sent a message to Ingram, asking him\r\nto come and see her. When he went he found the little, dry, hard-eyed\r\nwoman in a terrible passion. She had forgotten all about Marcus Aurelius\r\nand the composure of a philosopher, and the effect of anger on the\r\nnervous system. She was bolstered up in bed, for she had had another bad\r\nfit, but she was brisk enough in her manner and fierce enough in her\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ingram,\" she said the moment he had entered, \"do you consider my\r\nnephew a beast?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" she retorted.\r\n\r\n\"Then you are quite mistaken, Mrs. Lavender. Probably you have heard\r\nsome exaggerated story of all this business. He has been very\r\ninconsiderate and thoughtless, certainly, but I don't believe he quite\r\nknew how sensitive his wife was; and he is very repentant now, and I\r\nknow he will keep his promises.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would apologize for the devil,\" said the little old woman frowning.\r\n\r\n\"I would try to give him his due, at all events,\" said Ingram with a\r\nlaugh. \"I know Frank Lavender very well--I have known him for years--and\r\nI know there is good stuff in him, which may be developed in proper\r\ncircumstances. After all, what is there more common than for a married\r\nman to neglect his wife? He only did unconsciously and thoughtlessly\r\nwhat heaps of men do deliberately.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are making me angry,\" said Mrs. Lavender in a severe voice.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it fair to expect men to be demigods,\" Ingram said\r\ncarelessly. \"I never met any demigods myself: they don't live in my\r\nneighborhood. Perhaps if I had had some experience of a batch of them, I\r\nshould be more censorious of other people. If you set up Frank for a\r\nBayard, is it his fault or yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to be talked out of my common sense, and me on my\r\ndeath-bed,\" said the old lady impatiently, and yet with some secret hope\r\nthat Ingram would go on talking and amuse her. \"I won't have you say he\r\nis anything but a stupid and ungrateful boy, who married a wife far too\r\ngood for him. He is worse than that--he is much worse than that; but as\r\nthis may be my death-bed, I will keep a civil tongue in my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you didn't like his wife very much?\" said Ingram.\r\n\r\n\"I am not bound to like her because I think badly of him, am I? She was\r\nnot a bad sort of girl, after all--temper a little stiff, perhaps; but\r\nshe was honest. It did one's eyes good to look at her bright face. Yes,\r\nshe was a good sort of creature in her way. But when she ran off from\r\nhim, why didn't she come to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you never encouraged her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Encouragement! Where ought a married woman go to but to her husband's\r\nrelatives? If she cannot stay with him, let her take the next best\r\nsubstitute. It was her duty to come to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Sheila had fancied it to be her duty, she would have come here at\r\nany cost.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Ingram?\" said Mrs. Lavender severely.\r\n\r\n\"Well, supposing she didn't like you--\" he was beginning to say\r\ncautiously, when she sharply interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\"She didn't like me, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said nothing of the kind. I was about to say that if she had thought\r\nit her duty to come here, she would have come in any circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"She might have done worse. A young woman risks a great deal in running\r\naway from her husband's home. People will talk. Who is to make people\r\nbelieve just the version of the story that the husband or wife would\r\nprefer?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what does Sheila care,\" said Ingram with a hot flush in his face,\r\n\"for the belief of a lot of idle gossips and slanderers?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mr. Ingram,\" said the old lady, \"you are not a woman, and you\r\ndon't know the bother one has to look after one's reputation. But that\r\nis a question not likely to interest you. Let us talk of something else.\r\nDo you know why I wanted you to come and see me to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean to leave you all my money.\"\r\n\r\nHe stared. She did not appear to be joking. Was it possible that her\r\nrage against her nephew had carried her to this extreme resolve?\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he stammered, \"but I won't have it, Mrs. Lavender.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you'll have to have it,\" said the little old woman severely. \"You\r\nare a poor man. You could make good use of my money--better than a\r\ncharity board that would starve the poor with a penny out of each\r\nshilling, and spend the other elevenpence in treating their friends to\r\nflower-shows and dinners. Do you think I mean to leave my money to such\r\npeople? You shall have it. I think you would look very well driving a\r\nmail-phaeton in the Park; and I suppose you would give up your pipes and\r\nyour philosophy and your bachelor walks into the country. You would\r\nmarry, of course: every man is bound to make a fool of himself that way\r\nas soon as he gets enough money to do it with. But perhaps you might\r\ncome across a clever and sensible woman, who would look after you and\r\ngive you your own way while having her own. Only don't marry a fool.\r\nWhatever you do, don't marry a fool, or all your philosophers won't make\r\nthe house bearable to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not likely to marry anybody, Mrs. Lavender,\" said Ingram\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n\"Is there no woman you know whom you would care to marry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"there is one woman--yes--who seems to me about\r\neverything that a man could wish, but the notion of my marrying her is\r\nabsurd. If I had known in time, don't you see, that I should ever think\r\nof such a thing, I should have begun years ago to dye my hair. I can't\r\nbegin now. Gray hair inspires reverence, I believe, but it is a bad\r\nthing to go courting with.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not talk foolishly,\" said the little old lady with a frown.\r\n\"Do you think a sensible woman wants to marry a boy who will torment her\r\nwith his folly and his empty head and his running after a dozen\r\ndifferent women? Gray hair! If you think gray hair is a bad thing to go\r\ncourting with, I will give you something better. I will put something in\r\nyour hand that will make the young lady forget your gray hair. Oh, of\r\ncourse you will say that she cannot be tempted, that she despises money.\r\nIf so, so much the better; but I have known more women than you, and my\r\nhair is grayer than yours, and you will find that a little money won't\r\nstand in the way of your being accepted.\"\r\n\r\nHe had made some gesture of protest, not against her speaking of his\r\npossible marriage, which scarcely interested him, so remote was the\r\npossibility, but against her returning to this other proposal. And when\r\nhe saw the old woman really meant to do this thing, he found it\r\nnecessary to declare himself explicitly on the point. \"Oh, don't\r\nimagine, Mrs. Lavender,\" he said, \"that I have any wild horror of money,\r\nor that I suppose anybody else would have. I should like to have five\r\ntimes or ten times as much as you seem generously disposed to give me.\r\nBut here is the point, you see. I am a vain person. I am very proud of\r\nmy own opinion of myself; and if I acceded to what you propose--if I\r\ntook your money--I suppose I should be driving about in that fine\r\nphaeton you speak of. That is very good: I like driving, and I should be\r\npleased with the appearance of the trap and the horses. But what do you\r\nfancy I should think of myself--what would be my opinion of my own\r\nnobleness and generosity and humanity--if I saw Sheila Mackenzie walking\r\nby on the pavement, without any carriage to drive in, perhaps without a\r\nnotion as to where she was going to get her dinner? I should be a great\r\nhero to myself then, shouldn't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Sheila again!\" said the old woman in a tone of vexation. \"I can't\r\nimagine what there is in that girl to make men rave so about her. That\r\nJew-boy is become a thorough nuisance: you would fancy she had just\r\nstepped down out of the clouds to present him with a gold harp, and that\r\nhe couldn't look up to her face. And you are just as bad. You are worse,\r\nfor you don't blow it off in steam. Well, there need be no difficulty. I\r\nmeant to leave the girl in your charge. You take the money and look\r\nafter her: I know she won't starve. Take it in trust for her, if you\r\nlike.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is a fearful responsibility, Mrs. Lavender,\" he said in\r\ndismay. \"She is a married woman. Her husband is the proper person--\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you I won't give him a farthing!\" she said with a sudden\r\nsharpness that startled him--\"not a farthing! If he wants money, let him\r\nwork for it, as other people do; and then, when he has done that, if he\r\nis to have any of my money, he must be beholden for it to his wife and\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that Sheila would accept anything that she would not\r\nimmediately hand over to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he must come first to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no wish to inflict humiliation on any one,\" said Ingram stiffly.\r\n\"I don't wish to play the part of a little Providence and mete out\r\npunishment in that way. I might have to begin with myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't be foolish,\" said the old lady with a menacing composure.\r\n\"I give you fair warning: the next fit will do for me. If you don't\r\ncare to take my money, and keep it in trust for this girl you profess to\r\ncare so much about, I will leave it to found an institution. And I have\r\na good idea for an institution, mind you. I mean to teach people what\r\nthey should eat and drink, and the various effects of food on various\r\nconstitutions.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an important subject,\" Ingram admitted.\r\n\r\n\"Is it not? What is the use of giving people laborious information about\r\nthe idle fancies of generations that lived ages before they were born,\r\nwhile you are letting them poison their system, and lay up for\r\nthemselves a fearfully painful old age, by the continuous use of\r\nunsuitable food? That book you gave me, Mr. Ingram, is a wonderful book,\r\nbut it gives you little consolation if you know another fit is coming\r\non. And what is the good of knowing about Epictetus and Zeno and the\r\nrest if you've got rheumatism? Now, I mean to have classes to teach\r\npeople what they should eat and drink; and I'll do it if you won't\r\nassume the guardianship of my nephew's wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is the wildest notion I ever heard of,\" Ingram protested\r\nagain. \"How can I take charge of her? If Sheila herself had shown any\r\ndisposition to place herself under your care, it might have been\r\ndifferent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it would have been different!\" cried the old lady with a shrill\r\nlaugh. \"It would have been different! And what did you say about her\r\nsense of duty to her husband's relatives? Did you say anything about\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--\" Ingram was about to say, being lost in amazement at the odd\r\nglee of this withered old creature.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you think a young wife should go if she runs off from her\r\nhusband's house?\" cried Mrs. Lavender, apparently much amused by his\r\nperplexity. \"Where can she best escape calumny? Poor man! I won't\r\nfrighten you or disturb you any longer. Ring the bell, will you? I want\r\nPaterson.\"\r\n\r\nIngram rang.\r\n\r\n\"Paterson,\" said Mrs. Lavender when the tall and grave woman appeared,\r\n\"ask Mrs. Lavender if she can come here for a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\nIngram looked at the old woman to see if she had gone mad, and then,\r\nsomehow, he instinctively turned to the door. He fancied he knew that\r\nquick, light step. And then, before he well knew how, Sheila had come\r\nforward to him with her hands outstretched and with something like a\r\nsmile on her pale face. She looked at him for a second, she tried to\r\nspeak to him, but there was a dangerous quivering of the lips; and then\r\nshe suddenly burst into tears, and let go his hands and turned away. In\r\nthat brief moment he had seen what havoc had been wrought within the\r\npast two or three days. There were the same proud and handsome features,\r\nbut they were pale and worn, and there was a piteous and weary look in\r\nthe eyes that told of the trouble and heartrending of sleepless nights.\r\n\r\n\"Sheila,\" he said, following her and taking her hand, \"does any one know\r\nof your being here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said, still holding her head aside and downcast--\"no one. And\r\nI do not wish any one to know. I am going away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you ask too much, Mr. Ingram,\" said the old lady from amid her\r\ncushions and curtains. \"Give her that ammonia--the stopper only. Now,\r\nsit down, child, and dry your eyes. You need not be ashamed to show Mr.\r\nIngram that you knew where you ought to come to when you left your\r\nhusband's house. And if you won't stop here, of course I can't compel\r\nyou, though Mr. Ingram will tell you you might do worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sheila, why do you wish to go away? Do you mean to go back to the\r\nLewis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, no!\" she said, almost shuddering.\r\n\r\n\"Where do you wish to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anywhere--it does not matter. But I cannot remain here. I should meet\r\nwith--with many people I used to know. Mrs. Lavender, she is kind enough\r\nto say she will get me some place for Mairi and me: that is all as yet\r\nthat is settled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Mairi with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes: I will go and bring her to you. It is not any one in London she\r\nwill want to see as much as you.\"\r\n\r\nSheila left the room, and by and by came back, leading the young\r\nHighland girl by the hand. Mairi was greatly embarrassed, scarcely\r\nknowing whether she should show any gladness at meeting this old friend\r\namid so much trouble. But when Ingram shook hands with her, and after\r\nshe had blushed and looked shy and said, \"And are you ferry well, sir?\"\r\nshe managed somehow to lift her eyes to his face; and then she said\r\nsuddenly, \"And it is a good day, this day, for Miss Sheila, that you\r\nwill come to see her, Mr. Ingram, for she will hef a friend now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yon silly girl,\" said Mrs. Lavender sharply, \"why will you say 'Miss\r\nSheila?' Don't you know she is a married woman?\"\r\n\r\nMairi glanced in a nervous and timid manner toward the bed. She was\r\nevidently afraid of the little shriveled old woman with the staring\r\nblack eyes and the harsh voice.\r\n\r\n\"Mairi hasn't forgotten her old habits, that is all,\" said Ingram,\r\npatting her good-naturedly on the head.\r\n\r\nAnd then he sat down again, and it seemed so strange to him to see these\r\ntwo together again, and to hear the odd inflection of Mairi's voice,\r\nthat he almost forgot that he had made a great discovery in learning of\r\nSheila's whereabouts, and wholly forgot that he had just been offered,\r\nand had just refused, a fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nMEETING AND PARTING.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Sheila in Mrs. Lavender's house certainly surprised\r\nIngram, but the motives which led her to go thither were simple enough.\r\nOn the morning on which she had left her husband's house she and Mairi\r\nhad been driven up to Euston Square Station before she seemed capable\r\nof coming to any decision. Mairi guessed at what had happened with a\r\ngreat fear at her heart, and did not dare to speak of it. She sat, mute\r\nand frightened, in a corner of the cab, and only glanced from time to\r\ntime at her companion's pale face and troubled and distant eyes.\r\n\r\nThey were driven in to the station. Sheila got out, still seeming to\r\nknow nothing of what was around her. The cabman took down Mairi's trunk\r\nand handed it to a porter.\r\n\r\n\"Where for, miss?\" said the man. And she started.\r\n\r\n\"Where will you be going, Miss Sheila?\" said Mairi timidly.\r\n\r\n\"It is no matter just now,\" said Sheila to the porter, \"if you will be\r\nso kind as to take charge of the trunk. And how much must I pay the\r\ncabman from Notting Hill?\"\r\n\r\nShe gave him the money and walked into the great stone-paved hall, with\r\nits lofty roof and sounding echoes.\r\n\r\n\"Mairi,\" she said, \"I have gone away from my own home, and I have no\r\nhome for you or myself either. What are we to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite sure, Miss Sheila,\" said the girl, dismayed beyond\r\nexpression, \"that you will not go back to your own house? It wass a bad\r\nday this day that I wass come to London to find you going away from your\r\nown house;\" and Mairi began to cry. \"Will we go back to the Lewis, Miss\r\nSheila?\" she said. \"It is many a one there will be proud and pleased to\r\nsee you again in sa Lewis, and there will be plenty of homes for you\r\nthere--oh yes, ferry many that will be glad to see you! And it wass a\r\nbad day sa day you left the Lewis whatever; and if you will go back\r\nagain, Miss Sheila, you will neffer hef to go away again, not any more.\"\r\n\r\nSheila looked at the girl--at the pretty pale face, the troubled\r\nlight-blue eyes and the abundant fair-yellow hair. It was Mairi, sure\r\nenough, who was talking to her, and yet it was in a strange place. There\r\nwas no sea dashing outside, no tide running in from the Atlantic. And\r\nwhere was old Scarlett, with her complaints and her petulance and her\r\nmotherly kindness?\r\n\r\n\"It is a pity you have come to London, Mairi,\" Sheila said wistfully;\r\n\"for I have no house to take you into; and we must go now and find one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not go back to sa Lewis, Miss Sheila?\"\r\n\r\n\"They would not know me in the Lewis any more, Mairi. I have been too\r\nlong away, and I am quite changed. It is many a time I will think of\r\ngoing back; but when I left the Lewis I was married, and now--How could\r\nI go back to the Lewis, Mairi? They would look at me. They would ask\r\nquestions. My father would come down to the quay, and he would say,\r\n'Sheila, have you come back alone?' And all the story of it would go\r\nabout the island, and every one would say I had been a bad wife, and my\r\nhusband had gone away from me.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is not any one,\" said Mairi, with the tears starting to her eyes\r\nagain--\"not from one end of sa island to sa other--would say that of\r\nyou, Miss Sheila; and there is no one would not come to meet you, and be\r\nglad sat you will come again to your own home. And as for going back, I\r\nwill be ferry glad to go back whatever, for it was you I was come to\r\nsee, and not any town; and I do not like this town, what I hef seen of\r\nit, and I will be ferry glad to go away wis you, Miss Sheila.\"\r\n\r\nSheila did not answer. She felt that it was impossible she could go back\r\nto her own people with this disgrace upon her, and did not even argue\r\nthe question with herself. All her trouble now was to find some harbor\r\nof refuge into which she could flee, so that she might have quiet and\r\nsolitude, and an opportunity of studying all that had befallen her. The\r\nnoise around her--the arrival of travelers, the transference of luggage,\r\nthe screaming of trains--stunned and confused her; and she could only\r\nvaguely think of all the people she knew in London, to see to whom she\r\ncould go for advice and direction. They were not many. One after the\r\nother she went over the acquaintances she had made, and not one of them\r\nappeared to her in the light of a friend. One friend she had who would\r\nhave rejoiced to be of the least assistance to her, but her husband had\r\nforbidden her to hold communication with him, and she felt a strange\r\nsort of pride, even at this moment, in resolving to obey that\r\ninjunction. In all this great city that lay around her there was no\r\nother to whom she could frankly and readily go. That one friend she had\r\npossessed before she came to London: in London she had not made another.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was necessary to do something, for who could tell but that\r\nher husband might come to this station in search of her? Mairi's\r\nanxiety, too, was increasing every moment, insomuch that she was fairly\r\ntrembling with excitement and fatigue. Sheila resolved that she would go\r\ndown and throw herself on the tender mercies of that terrible old lady\r\nin Kensington Gore. For one thing, she instinctively sought the help of\r\na woman in her present plight; and perhaps this harshly-spoken old lady\r\nwould be gentle to her when all her story was told. Another thing that\r\nprompted this decision was a sort of secret wish to identify herself\r\neven yet with her husband's family--to prove to herself, as it were,\r\nthat they had not cast her off as being unworthy of him. Nothing was\r\nfarther from her mind at this moment than any desire to pave the way for\r\nreconciliation and reunion with her husband. Her whole anxiety was to\r\nget away from him, to put an end to a state of things which she had\r\nfound to be more than she could bear. And yet, if she had had friends in\r\nLondon called respectively Mackenzie and Lavender, and if she had been\r\nequally intimate with both, she would at this moment have preferred to\r\ngo for help to those bearing the name of Lavender.\r\n\r\nThere was doubtless something strangely inconsistent in this instinct of\r\nwifely loyalty and duty in a woman who had just voluntarily left her\r\nhusband's house. Lavender had desired her not to hold communication with\r\nEdward Ingram: even now she would respect his wish. Lavender would\r\nprefer that she should, in any great extremity, go to his aunt for\r\nassistance and counsel; and to his aunt, despite her own dislike of the\r\nwoman, she would go. At this moment, when Sheila's proud spirit had\r\nrisen up in revolt against a system of treatment that had become\r\ninsufferable to her, when she had been forced to leave her home and\r\nincur the contemptuous compassion of friends and acquaintances, if\r\nEdward Ingram himself had happened to meet her, and had begun to say\r\nhard things of Lavender, she would have sharply recalled him to a sense\r\nof the discretion that one must use in speaking to a wife of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nThe two homeless girls got into another cab, and were driven down to\r\nKensington Gore. Sheila asked if she could see Mrs. Lavender. She knew\r\nthat the old lady had had another bad fit, but she was supposed to be\r\nrecovering rapidly. Mrs. Lavender would see her in her bedroom, and so\r\nSheila went up. The girl could not speak.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see it--something wrong about that precious husband of yours,\"\r\nsaid the old lady, watching her keenly. \"I expected it. Go on. What is\r\nthe matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have left him,\" Sheila said with her face very pale, but no sign of\r\nemotion about the firm lips.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, good gracious, child! Left him? How many people know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one but yourself and a young Highland girl who has come up to see\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"You came to me first of all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you no other friends to go to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I considered that I ought to come to you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no cunning in the speech: it was the simple truth. Mrs.\r\nLavender looked at her hard for a second or two, and then said, in what\r\nshe meant to be a kind way, \"Come here and sit down, child, and tell me\r\nall about it. If no one else knows it there is no harm done. We can\r\neasily patch it up before it gets abroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not come to you for that, Mrs. Lavender,\" said Sheila calmly.\r\n\"That is impossible: that is all over. I have come to ask you where I\r\nmay get lodgings for my friend and myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me all about it first, and then we'll see whether it can't be\r\nmended. Mind, I am ready to be on your side, though I am your husband's\r\naunt. I think you're a good girl: a bit of a temper, you know, but you\r\nmanage to keep it quiet ordinarily. You tell me all about it, and you'll\r\nsee if I haven't means to bring him to reason. Oh yes, oh yes, I'm an\r\nold woman, but I can find some means to bring him to reason.\" And she\r\nlaughed an odd, shrill laugh.\r\n\r\nA hot flush came over Sheila's face. Had she come to this old woman only\r\nto make her husband's degradation more complete? Was he to be\r\nintimidated into making friends with her by a threat of the withdrawal\r\nof that money that Sheila had begun to detest? And this was what her\r\nnotions of wifely duty had led to!\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Lavender,\" she said, with the proud lips very proud indeed, \"I\r\nmust say this to you before I tell you anything. It is very good of you\r\nto say you will take my side, but I did not come to you to complain. And\r\nI would rather not have any sympathy from you if it only means that you\r\nwill speak ill of my husband. And if you think you can make him do\r\nthings because you give him money, perhaps that is true at present, but\r\nit may not always be true, and you cannot expect me to wish it to\r\ncontinue. I would rather have my present trouble twenty times over than\r\nsee him being bought over to any woman's wishes.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lavender stared at her: \"Why, you astonishing girl, I believe you\r\nare still in love with that man!\"\r\n\r\nSheila said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Is it true?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose a woman ought to love her husband,\" Sheila answered.\r\n\r\n\"Even if he turns her out of the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is she who is to blame,\" Sheila said humbly. \"Perhaps her\r\neducation was wrong, or she expects too much that is unreasonable, or\r\nperhaps she has a bad temper. You think I have a bad temper, Mrs.\r\nLavender, and might it not be that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think you want your own way, and doubtless you expect to have\r\nit now. I suppose I am to listen to all your story, and I must not say a\r\nword about my own nephew. But sit down and tell me all about it, and\r\nthen you can justify him afterward, if you like.\"\r\n\r\nIt was probably, however, the notion that Sheila would try to justify\r\nLavender all through that put the old lady on her guard, and made her,\r\nindeed, regard Lavender's conduct in an unfairly bad light. Sheila told\r\nthe story as simply as she could, putting everything down to her\r\nhusband's advantage that was possible, and asking for no sympathy\r\nwhatsoever. She only wanted to remain away from his house; and by what\r\nmeans could she and this young cousin of hers find cheap lodgings where\r\nthey could live quietly and without much fear of detection?\r\n\r\nMrs. Lavender was in a rage, and as she was not allowed to vent it on\r\nthe proper object, she turned upon Sheila herself. \"The Highlanders are\r\na proud race,\" she said sharply. \"I should have thought that rooms in\r\nthis house, even with the society of a cantankerous old woman, would\r\nhave been tolerated for a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very kind of you to make the offer,\" Sheila said, \"but I do not\r\nwish to have to meet my husband or any of his friends. There is enough\r\ntrouble without that. If you could tell me where to get lodgings not far\r\nfrom this neighborhood, I would come to see you sometimes at such hours\r\nas I know he cannot be here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't understand what you mean. You won't go back to your\r\nhusband, although I could manage that for you directly--you won't hear\r\nof negotiations, or of any prospect of your going back--and yet you\r\nwon't go home to your father.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot do either,\" Sheila said.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to live in those lodgings always?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell?\" said the girl piteously. \"I only wish to be away, and\r\nI cannot go back to my papa, with all this story to tell him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I didn't want to distress you,\" said the old woman. \"You know\r\nyour own affairs best. I think you are mad. If you would calmly reason\r\nwith yourself, and show to yourself that, in a hundred years, or less\r\nthan that, it won't matter whether you gratified your pride or no, you\r\nwould see that the wisest thing you can do now is to take an easy and\r\ncomfortable course. You are in an excited and nervous state at present,\r\nfor example; and that is destroying so much of the vital portion of your\r\nframe. If you go into these lodgings and live like a rat in a hole, you\r\nwill have nothing to do but nurse these sorrows of yours, and find them\r\ngrow bigger and bigger while you grow more and more wretched. All that\r\nis mere pride and sentiment and folly. On the other hand, look at this.\r\nYour husband is sorry you are away from him: you may take that for\r\ngranted. You say he was merely thoughtless: now he has got something to\r\nmake him think, and would without doubt come and beg your pardon if you\r\ngave him a chance. I write to him, he comes down here, you kiss and make\r\ngood friends again, and to-morrow morning you are comfortable and happy\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow morning!\" said Sheila sadly. \"Do you know how we should be\r\nsituated to-morrow morning? The story of my going away would become\r\nknown to his friends: he would go among them as though he had suffered\r\nsome disgrace, and I the cause of it. And though he is a man, and would\r\nsoon be careless of that, how could I go with him amongst his friends,\r\nand feel that I had shamed him? It would be worse than ever between us;\r\nand I have no wish to begin again what ended this morning--none at all,\r\nMrs. Lavender.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you mean to say that you intend to live permanently apart from\r\nyour husband?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" said Sheila in a despairing tone. \"I cannot tell you.\r\nWhat I feel is that, with all this trouble, it is better that our life\r\nas it was in that house should come to an end.\"\r\n\r\nThen she rose. There was a tired look about the face, as if she were too\r\nweary to care whether this old woman would help her or no. Mrs. Lavender\r\nregarded her for a moment, wondering, perhaps, that a girl so handsome,\r\nfine-colored and proud-eyed should be distressing herself with imaginary\r\nsentiments, instead of taking life cheerfully, enjoying the hour as it\r\npassed, and being quite assured of the interest and liking and homage of\r\nevery one with whom she came in contact. Sheila turned to the bed once\r\nmore, about to say that she had troubled Mrs. Lavender too much already,\r\nand that she would look after these lodgings. But the old woman\r\napparently anticipated as much, and said with much deliberation that if\r\nSheila and her companion would only remain one or two days in the house,\r\nproper rooms should be provided for them somewhere. Young girls could\r\nnot venture into lodgings without strict inquiries being made. Sheila\r\nshould have suitable rooms, and Mrs. Lavender would see that she was\r\nproperly looked after and that she wanted for nothing. In the mean time\r\nshe must have some money.\r\n\r\n\"It is kind of you,\" said the girl, blushing hotly, \"but I do not\r\nrequire it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I suppose we are too proud,\" said the old woman. \"If we disapprove\r\nof our husband taking money, we must not do it either. Why, child, you\r\nhave learnt nothing in London. You are a savage yet. You must let me\r\ngive you something for your pocket, or what are you to do? You say you\r\nhave left everything at home: do you think hair-brushes, for example,\r\ngrow on trees, that you can go into Kensington Gardens and stock your\r\nrooms?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have some money--a few pounds--that my papa gave me,\" Sheila said.\r\n\r\n\"And when that is done?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will give me more.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet you don't wish him to know you have left your husband's house!\r\nWhat will he make of these repeated demands for money?\"\r\n\r\n\"My papa will give me anything I want without asking any questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he is a bigger fool than I expected. Oh, don't get into a temper\r\nagain. Those sudden shocks of color, child, show me that your heart is\r\nout of order. How can you expect to have a regular pulsation if you\r\nflare up at anything any one may say? Now go and fetch me your Highland\r\ncousin.\"\r\n\r\nMairi came into the room in a very timid fashion, and stared with her\r\nbig, light-blue eyes into the dusky recess in which the little old woman\r\nsat up in bed. Sheila took her forward: \"This is my cousin Mairi, Mrs.\r\nLavender.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are you ferry well, ma'am?\" said Mairi, holding out her hand very\r\nmuch as a boy pretends to hold out his hand to a tiger in the Zoological\r\nGardens.\r\n\r\n\"Well, young lady,\" said Mrs. Lavender, staring at her, \"and a pretty\r\nmess you have got us into!\"\r\n\r\n\"Me!\" said Mairi, almost with a cry of pain: she had not imagined before\r\nthat she had anything to do with Sheila's trouble.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Mairi,\" her companion said, taking her hand, \"it was not you.\r\nMrs. Lavender, Mairi does not understand our way of joking in London.\r\nPerhaps she will learn before she goes back to the Highlands.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing,\" said Mrs. Lavender, observing that Mairi's eyes\r\nhad filled the moment she was charged with bringing trouble on\r\nSheila--\"there is one thing you people from the Highlands seem never\r\ndisposed to learn, and that is to have a little control over your\r\npassions. If one speaks to you a couple of words, you either begin to\r\ncry or go off into a flash of rage. Don't you know how bad that is for\r\nthe health?\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said Sheila with a smile--and it seemed so strange to Mairi\r\nto see her smile--\"we will not compare badly in health with the people\r\nabout us here.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lavender dropped the question, and began to explain to Sheila what\r\nshe advised her to do. In the mean time both the girls were to remain\r\nin her house. She would guarantee their being met by no one. When\r\nsuitable rooms had been looked out by Paterson they were to remove\r\nthither. The whole situation of affairs was at once perceived by Mrs.\r\nLavender's attendant, who was given to understand that no one was to\r\nknow of young Mrs. Lavender's being in the house. Then the old woman,\r\nmuch contented with what she had done, resolved that she would reward\r\nherself with a joke, and sent for Edward Ingram.\r\n\r\nWhen Sheila, as already described, came into the room, and found her old\r\nfriend there, the resolution she had formed went clean out of her mind.\r\nShe forgot entirely the ban that had been placed on Ingram by her\r\nhusband. But after her first emotion on seeing him was over, and when he\r\nbegan to discuss what she ought to do, and even to advise her in a\r\ndiffident sort of way, she remembered all that she had forgotten, and\r\nwas ashamed to find herself sitting there and talking to him as if it\r\nwere in her father's house at Borva. Indeed, when he proposed to take\r\nthe management of her affairs into his own hands, and to go and look at\r\ncertain apartments that Paterson had proposed, she was forced, with\r\ngreat heart-burning and pain, to hint to him that she could not avail\r\nherself of his kindness.\r\n\r\n\"But why?\" he asked with a stare of surprise.\r\n\r\n\"You remember Brighton,\" she answered, looking down. \"You had a bad\r\nreturn for your kindness to me then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know,\" he said carelessly. \"And I suppose Mr. Lavender wished you\r\nto cut me after my impertinent interference. But things are very much\r\nchanged now. But for the time he went North, he has been with me nearly\r\nevery hour since you left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Frank been to the Lewis?\" she said suddenly, with a look of fear on\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no: he has only been to Glasgow to see if you had gone to catch the\r\nClansman and go North from there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he take the trouble to do all that?\" she asked slowly and\r\nwistfully.\r\n\r\n\"Trouble!\" cried Ingram. \"He appears to me neither to eat nor sleep day\r\nor night, but to go wandering about in search of you in every place\r\nwhere he fancies you may be. I never saw a man so beside himself with\r\nanxiety.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not wish to make him anxious,\" said Sheila in a low voice. \"Will\r\nyou tell him that I am well?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lavender began to smile. Were there not evident signs of softening?\r\nBut Ingram, who knew the girl better, was not deceived by these\r\nappearances. He could see that Sheila merely wished that her husband\r\nshould not suffer pain on her account: that was all.\r\n\r\n\"I was about to ask you,\" he said gently, \"what I may say to him. He\r\ncomes to me continually, for he has always fancied that you would\r\ncommunicate with me. What shall I say to him, Sheila?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may tell him that I am well,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nMairi had by this time stepped out of the room. Sheila sat with her eyes\r\nfixed on the floor, her fingers working nervously with a paper-knife she\r\nheld.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more than that?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw by her face, and he could tell by the sound of her voice, that\r\nher decision was resolute.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool, child!\" said Mrs. Lavender emphatically. \"Here is your\r\nhusband's friend, who can make everything straight and comfortable for\r\nyou in an hour or two, and you quietly put aside the chance of\r\nreconciliation and bring on yourself any amount of misery. I don't speak\r\nfor Frank. Men can take care of themselves: they have clubs and friends,\r\nand amusements for the whole day long. But you!--what a pleasant life\r\nyou would have, shut up in a couple of rooms, scarcely daring to show\r\nyourself at a window! Your fine sentiments are all very well, but they\r\nwon't stand in the place of a husband to you; and you will soon find out\r\nthe difference between living by yourself like that, and having some one\r\nin the house to look after you. Am I right, Mr. Ingram, or am I wrong?\"\r\n\r\nIngram paused for a moment, and said, \"I have not the same courage that\r\nyou have, Mrs. Lavender. I dare not advise Sheila one way or the other\r\njust at present. But if she feels in her own heart that she would rather\r\nreturn now to her husband, I can safely say that she would find him\r\ndeeply grateful to her, and that he would try to do everything that she\r\ndesired. That I know. He wants to see you, Sheila, if only for five\r\nminutes, to beg your forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot see him,\" she said with the same sad and settled air.\r\n\r\n\"I am not to tell him where you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no!\" she cried with a sudden and startled emphasis. \"You must not do\r\nthat, Mr. Ingram. Promise me you will not do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do promise you; but you put a painful duty on me, Sheila, for you\r\nknow how he will believe that a short interview with you would put\r\neverything right, and he will look on me as preventing that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think a short interview at present would put everything right?\"\r\nshe said, suddenly looking up and regarding him with her clear and\r\nsteadfast eyes.\r\n\r\nHe dared not answer. He felt in his inmost heart that it would not.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well,\" said Mrs. Lavender, \"young people have much satisfaction in\r\nbeing proud: when they come to my age, they may find they would have\r\nbeen happier if they had been less disdainful.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not disdain, Mrs. Lavender,\" said Sheila gently.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever it is,\" said the old woman, \"I must remind you two people that\r\nI am an invalid. Go away and have luncheon: Paterson will look after\r\nyou. Mr. Ingram, give me that book, that I may read myself into a nap,\r\nand don't forget what I expect of you.\"\r\n\r\nIngram suddenly remembered. He and Sheila and Mairi sat down to luncheon\r\nin the dining-room, and while he strove to get them to talk about Borva\r\nhe was thinking all the time of the extraordinary position he was\r\nexpected to assume toward Sheila. Not only was he to be the repository\r\nof the secret of her place of residence, and the message-carrier between\r\nherself and her husband, but he was also to take Mrs. Lavender's\r\nfortune, in the event of her dying, and hold it in trust for the young\r\nwife. Surely this old woman, with her suspicious ways and her worldly\r\nwisdom, would not be so foolish as to hand him over all her property,\r\nfree of conditions, on the simple understanding that when he chose he\r\ncould give what he chose to Sheila? And yet that was what she had vowed\r\nshe would do, to Ingram's profound dismay.\r\n\r\nHe labored hard to lighten the spirits of those two girls. He talked of\r\nJohn the Piper, and said he would invite him up to London, and described\r\nhis probable appearance in the Park. He told them stories of his\r\nadventures while he was camping out with some young artists in the\r\nWestern Highlands, and told them anecdotes, old, recent and of his own\r\ninvention, about the people he had met. Had they heard of the steward on\r\nboard one of the Clyde steamers who had a percentage on the drink\r\nconsumed in the cabin, and who would call out to the captain, \"Why wass\r\nyou going so fast? Dinna put her into the quay so fast! There is a gran'\r\ncompany down below, and they are drinking fine!\" Had he ever told them\r\nof the porter at Arran who had demanded sixpence for carrying up some\r\nluggage, but who, after being sent to get a sovereign changed, came back\r\nwith only eighteen shillings, saying, \"Oh yes, it iss sexpence! Oh, ay,\r\nit iss sexpence! But it iss two shullens _ta you!_\" Or of the other, who\r\nafter being paid hung about the cottage-door for nearly an hour, until\r\nIngram, coming out, asked him why he had waited; whereupon he said, with\r\nan air of perfect indifference, \"Oo, ay, there was something said about\r\na dram; but hoot toots! it is of no consequence whatever!\" And was it\r\ntrue that the sheriff of Stornoway was so kind-hearted a man that he\r\nremitted the punishment of certain culprits, ordained by the statute to\r\nbe whipped with birch rods, on the ground that the island of Lewis\r\nproduced no birch, and that he was not bound to import it? And had Mairi\r\nheard any more of the Black Horse of Loch Suainabhal? And where had she\r\npulled those splendid bunches of bell-heather?\r\n\r\nHe suddenly stopped, and Sheila looked up with inquiring eyes. How did\r\nhe know that Mairi had brought those things with her? Sheila saw that he\r\nmust have gone up with her husband, and must have seen the room which\r\nshe had decorated in imitation of the small parlor at Borvabost. She\r\nwould rather not think of that room now.\r\n\r\n\"When are you going to the Lewis?\" she asked of him with her eyes cast\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think I have changed my mind about that, Sheila. I don't think\r\nI shall go to the Lewis this autumn.\"\r\n\r\nHer face became more and more embarrassed: how was she to thank him for\r\nhis continued thoughtfulness and self-sacrifice?\r\n\r\n\"There is no necessity,\" he said lightly. \"The man I am going with has\r\nno particular purpose in view. We shall merely go cruising about those\r\nwonderful lochs and islands, and I am sure to run against some of those\r\nyoung fellows I know, who are prowling about the fishing-villages with\r\nportable easels. They are good boys, those boys. They are very\r\nhospitable, if they have only a single bedroom in a small cottage as\r\ntheir studio and reception-room combined. I should not wonder, Sheila,\r\nif I went ashore somewhere, and put up my lot with those young fellows,\r\nand listened to their wicked stories, and lived on whisky and herrings\r\nfor a month. Would you like to see me return to Whitehall in kilts? And\r\nI should go into the office and salute everybody with 'And are you ferry\r\nwell?' just as Mairi does. But don't be downhearted, Mairi. You speak\r\nEnglish a good deal better than many English folks I know; and by the\r\ntime you go back to the Lewis we shall have you fit to become a\r\nschool-mistress, not only in Borva, but in Stornoway itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wass told it is ferry good English they hef in Stornoway,\" said\r\nMairi, not very sure whether Mr. Ingram was joking or not.\r\n\r\n\"My dear child,\" he cried, \"I tell you it is the best English in the\r\nworld. If the queen only knew, she would send her grandchildren to be\r\neducated there. But I must go now. Good-bye, Mairi. I mean to come and\r\ntake you to a theatre some night soon.\"\r\n\r\nSheila accompanied him out into the hall. \"When shall you see him?\" she\r\nsaid with her eyes cast down.\r\n\r\n\"This evening,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"I should like you to tell him that I am well, and that he need not be\r\nanxious about me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Sheila. I wish you had given me a pleasanter message to\r\ncarry, but when you think of doing that I shall be glad to take it.\"\r\n\r\nIngram left, and hastened in to his office. Sheila's affairs were\r\nconsiderably interfering with his attendance there--there could be no\r\nquestion of that--but he had the reputation of being able to get through\r\nhis work thoroughly, whatever might be the hours he devoted to it, so\r\nthat he did not greatly fear being rebuked for his present\r\nirregularities. Perhaps if a grave official warning had been probable,\r\neven that would not have interfered much with his determination to do\r\nwhat could be done for Sheila.\r\n\r\nBut this business of carrying a message to Lavender was the most serious\r\nhe had as yet undertaken. He had to make sundry and solemn resolves to\r\nput a bold face on the matter at the outset, and declare that wild\r\nhorses would not tear from him any further information. He feared the\r\npiteous appeals that might be made to him; the representations that,\r\nmerely for the sake of an imprudent promise, he was delaying a\r\nreconciliation between these two until that might be impossible; the\r\nreasons that would be urged on him for considering Sheila's welfare as\r\nparamount to his own scruples. He went through the interview, as he\r\nforesaw it, a dozen times over, and constructed replies to each\r\nargument and entreaty. Of course it would be simple enough to meet all\r\nLavender's demands with a simple \"No,\" but there are circumstances in\r\nwhich the heroic method of solving difficulties becomes a trifle\r\ninhuman.\r\n\r\nHe had promised to dine with Lavender that evening at his club. When he\r\nwent along to St. James's street at the appointed hour his host had not\r\narrived. He walked for about ten minutes, and then Lavender appeared,\r\nhaggard and wornout with fatigue. \"I have heard nothing--I can hear\r\nnothing--I have been everywhere,\" he said, leading the way at once into\r\nthe dining-room. \"I am sorry I have kept you waiting, Ingram.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat down at a small side-table: there were few men in the club at\r\nthis late season, so that they could talk freely enough when the waiter\r\nhad come and gone.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have some news for you, Lavender,\" Ingram said.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know where she is?\" said the other eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" he almost called aloud in his anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Ingram said slowly, \"she is in London, and she is very well; and\r\nyou need have no anxiety about her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is she?\" demanded Lavender, taking no heed of the waiter who\r\nwas standing by and uncorking a bottle.\r\n\r\n\"I promised her not to tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have spoken with her, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did she say? Where has she been? Good Heavens, Ingram! you don't\r\nmean to say you are going to keep it a secret?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" said the other: \"I will tell you everything she said to me, if\r\nyou like. Only I will not tell you where she is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not ask you,\" said Lavender at once, \"if she does not wish me to\r\nknow. But you can tell me about herself. What did she say? What was she\r\nlooking like? Is Mairi with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mairi is with her. And of course she is looking a little troubled\r\nand pale, and so forth; but she is very well, I should think, and quite\r\ncomfortably situated. She said I was to tell you that she was well, and\r\nthat you need not be anxious.\"\r\n\r\n\"She sent a message to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is it.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, Ingram! how can I ever thank you enough? I feel as glad just\r\nnow as if she had really come home again. And how did you manage it?\"\r\n\r\nLavender, in his excitement and gratitude, kept filling up his friend's\r\nglass the moment the least quantity had been taken out of it: the wonder\r\nwas he did not fill all the glasses on that side of the table, and\r\nbeseech Ingram to have two or three dinners all at once.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you needn't give me any credit about it,\" Ingram said. \"I stumbled\r\nagainst her by accident: at least, I did not find her out myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did she send for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. But look here, Lavender, this sort of cross-examination will lead\r\nto but one thing; and you say yourself you won't try to find out where\r\nshe is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not from you, any way. But how can I help wanting to know where she is?\r\nAnd my aunt was saying just now that very likely she had gone right away\r\nto the other end of London--to Peckham or some such place.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have seen Mrs. Lavender, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have just come from there. The old heathen thinks the whole affair\r\nrather a good joke; but perhaps that was only her way of showing her\r\ntemper, for she was in a bit of a rage, to be sure. And so Sheila sent\r\nme that message?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does she want money? Would you take her some money from me?\" he said\r\neagerly. Any bond of union between him and Sheila would be of some\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think she needs money; and in any case I know she wouldn't take\r\nit from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, Ingram, you have seen her and talked with her, what do you\r\nthink she intends to do? What do you think she would have me do?\"\r\n\r\n\"These are very dangerous questions for me to answer,\" Ingram said. \"I\r\ndon't see how you can expect me to assume the responsibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't ask you to do that at all. But I never found your advice to\r\nfail. And if you give me any hint as to what I should do, I will do it\r\non my own responsibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I won't. But this I will do: I will tell you as nearly as ever I\r\ncan what she said, and you can judge for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nVery cautiously indeed did Ingram set out on this perilous undertaking.\r\nIt was no easy matter so to shut out all references to Sheila's\r\nsurroundings that no hint should be given to this anxious listener as to\r\nher whereabouts. But Ingram got through it successfully; and when he had\r\nfinished Lavender sat some time in silence, merely toying with his\r\nknife, for indeed he had eaten nothing. \"If it is her wish,\" he said\r\nslowly, \"that I should not go to see her, I will not try to do so. But I\r\nshould like to know where she is. You say she is comfortable, and she\r\nhas Mairi for a companion; and that is something. In the mean time, I\r\nsuppose I must wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see, myself, how waiting is likely to do much good,\" said\r\nIngram. \"That won't alter your relations much.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may alter her determination. A woman is sure to soften into charity\r\nand forgiveness: she can't help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you were to ask Sheila now, she would say she had forgiven you\r\nalready. But that is a different matter from getting her to resume her\r\nformer method of life with you. To tell you the truth, I should strongly\r\nadvise her, if I were to give advice at all, not to attempt anything of\r\nthe sort. One failure is bad enough, and has wrought sufficient\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what am I to do, Ingram?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must judge for yourself what is the most likely way of winning back\r\nSheila's confidence in you, and the most likely conditions under which\r\nshe might be induced to join you again. You need not expect to get her\r\nback into that square, I should fancy: _that_ experiment has rather\r\nbroken down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Lavender, \"I sha'n't bore you any more just now about my\r\naffairs. Look after your dinner, old fellow: your starving yourself\r\nwon't help me much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean to starve myself at all,\" said Ingram, steadily making his\r\nway through the abundant dishes his friend had ordered. \"But I had a\r\nvery good luncheon this morning with--\"\r\n\r\n\"With Sheila,\" Lavender said quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Does it surprise you to find that she is in a place where she can\r\nget food? I wish the poor child had made better use of her\r\nopportunities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ingram,\" he said after a minute, \"could you take some money from me,\r\nwithout her knowing of it, and try to get her some of the little things\r\nshe likes--some delicacies, you know: they might be smuggled in, as it\r\nwere, without her knowing who had paid for them? There was ice-pudding,\r\nyou know, with strawberries in it, that she was fond of--\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, a woman in her position thinks of something else than\r\nice-pudding in strawberries.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why shouldn't she have it all the same? I would give twenty pounds\r\nto get some little gratification of that sort conveyed to her; and if\r\nyou could try, Ingram--\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, she has got everything she can want: there was no\r\nice-pudding at luncheon, but doubtless there will be at dinner.\"\r\n\r\nSo Sheila was staying in a house in which ices could be prepared?\r\nLavender's suggestion had had no cunning intention in it, but here was\r\nan obvious piece of information. She was in no humble lodging-house,\r\nthen. She was either staying with some friends--and she had no friends\r\nbut Lavender's friends--or she was staying at a hotel. He remembered\r\nthat she had once dined at the Langham, Mrs. Kavanagh having persuaded\r\nher to go to meet some American visitors. Might she have gone thither?\r\n\r\nLavender was somewhat silent during the rest of that meal, for he was\r\nthinking of other things besides the mere question as to where Sheila\r\nmight be staying. He was trying to imagine what she might have felt\r\nbefore she was driven to this step. He was trying to recall all manner\r\nof incidents of their daily life that he now saw might have appeared to\r\nher in a very different light from that in which he saw them. He was\r\nwondering, too, how all this could be altered, and a new life begun for\r\nthem both, if that were still possible.\r\n\r\nThey had gone up stairs into the smoking-room when a card was brought to\r\nLavender.\r\n\r\n\"Young Mosenberg is below,\" he said to Ingram. \"He will be a livelier\r\ncompanion for you than I could be. Waiter, ask this gentleman to come\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\nThe handsome Jew-boy came eagerly into the room, with much excitement\r\nvisible on his face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do you know,\" he said to Lavender, \"I have found out where Mrs.\r\nLavender is--yes? She is at your aunt's house. I saw her this afternoon\r\nfor one moment--\" He stopped, for he saw by the vexation on Ingram's\r\nface that he had done something wrong. \"Is it a mistake?\" he said. \"Is\r\nit a secret?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not likely to be a secret if you have got hold of it,\" said\r\nIngram sharply.\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry,\" said the boy. \"I thought you were all anxious to\r\nknow--\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not matter in the least,\" said Lavender quietly to both of\r\nthem. \"I shall not seek to disturb her. I am about to leave London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" said the boy.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know yet.\"\r\n\r\nThat, at least, had been part of the result of his meditations; and\r\nIngram, looking at him, wondered whether he meant to go away without\r\ntrying to say one word to Sheila.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Lavender,\" he said, \"you must not fancy we were trying to\r\nplay any useless and impertinent trick. To-morrow or next day Sheila\r\nwill leave your aunt's house, and then I should have told you that she\r\nhad been there, and how the old lady received her. It was Sheila's own\r\nwish that the lodgings she is going to should not be known. She fancies\r\nthat would save both of you a great deal of unnecessary and fruitless\r\npain, do you see? That really is her only object in wishing to have any\r\nconcealment about the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is no need for any such concealment,\" he said. \"You may tell\r\nSheila that if she likes to stay on with my aunt, so much the better;\r\nand I take it very kind of her that she went there, instead of going\r\nhome or to a strange house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I to tell her that you mean to leave London?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThey went into the billiard-room. Mosenberg was not permitted to play,\r\nas he had not dined in the club, but Ingram and Lavender proceeded to\r\nhave a game, the former being content to accept something like thirty in\r\na hundred. It was speedily very clear that Lavender's heart was not in\r\nthe contest. He kept forgetting which ball he had been playing, missing\r\neasy shots, playing a perversely wrong game, and so forth. And yet his\r\nspirits were not much downcast.\r\n\r\n\"Is Peter Hewetson still at Tarbert, do you know?\" he asked of Ingram.\r\n\r\n\"I believe so. I heard of him lately. He and one or two more are there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you'll look in on them if you go North?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. The place is badly perfumed, but picturesque, and there is\r\ngenerally plenty of whisky about.\"\r\n\r\n\"When do you go North?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. In a week or two.\"\r\n\r\nThat was all that Lavender hinted of his plans. He went home early that\r\nnight, and spent an hour or two in packing up some things, and in\r\nwriting a long letter to his aunt, which was destined considerably to\r\nastonish that lady. Then he lay down and had a few hours' rest.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning he went out and walked across Kensington Gardens\r\ndown to the Gore. He wished to have one look at the house in which\r\nSheila was, or perhaps he might, from a distance, see her come out on a\r\nsimple errand? He knew, for example, that she had a superstitious liking\r\nfor posting her letters herself: in wet weather or dry she invariably\r\ncarried her own correspondence to the nearest pillar-post. Perhaps he\r\nmight have one glimpse of her face, to see how she was looking, before\r\nhe left London.\r\n\r\nThere were few people about: one or two well-known lawyers and merchants\r\nwere riding by to have their morning canter in the Park; the shops were\r\nbeing opened. Over there was the house--with its dark front of bricks,\r\nits hard ivy, and its small windows with formal red curtains--in which\r\nSheila was immured. That was certainly not the palace that a beautiful\r\nsea-princess should have inhabited. Where were the pine woods around it,\r\nand the lofty hills, and the wild beating of the waves on the sands\r\nbelow? And now it seemed strange and sad that just as he was about to go\r\naway to the North, and breathe the salt air again, and find the strong\r\nwest winds blowing across the mountain-peaks and through the furze,\r\nSheila, a daughter of the sea and the rocks, should be hiding herself in\r\nobscure lodgings in the heart of a great city. Perhaps--he could not but\r\nthink at this time--if he had only the chance of speaking to her for a\r\ncouple of moments, he could persuade her to forgive him everything that\r\nhad happened, and go away with him--away from London and all the\r\nassociations that had vexed her and almost broken her heart--to the free\r\nand open and joyous life on the far sea-coasts of the Hebrides.\r\n\r\nSomething caused him to turn his head for a second, and he knew that\r\nSheila was coming along the pavement--not from, but toward the house. It\r\nwas too late to think of getting out of her way, and yet he dared not go\r\nup to her and speak to her, as he had wished to do. She, too, had seen\r\nhim. There was a quick, frightened look in her eyes, and then she came\r\nalong, with her face pale and her head downcast. He did not seek to\r\ninterrupt her. His eyes too were lowered as she passed him without\r\ntaking any notice of his presence, although the sad face and the\r\ntroubled lips told of the pain at her heart. He had hoped, perchance,\r\nfor one word, for even a sign of recognition, but she went by him\r\ncalmly, gravely and silently. She went into the house, and he turned\r\naway with a weight at his heart, as though the gates of heaven had been\r\nclosed against him.\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKESHORE RELICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were sitting on the sand looking off over the blue water veiled with\r\nthe soft haze of Indian summer. A point covered with pine trees\r\nstretched boldly out into the lake, its rocky cliffs rising\r\nperpendicularly eighty feet above the beach, a sheer precipice from\r\nwhose summit a pebble dropped would strike the water below. On the west\r\na stream came rippling over the stones between bluffs high and massive\r\nenough for a deep rapid river--bluffs of wild majesty worn into varied\r\noutlines, as though a mighty torrent had once surged between them,\r\nforcing the very rocks to crumble before its headlong career. But now\r\nonly a gentle stream wandered through the broad bed, here shallow over\r\nthe sand, there darkling in a still pool, now making a green\r\nwillow-shaded island, and now a deep rock-bordered channel, doing its\r\nbest with the various graceful devices of a happy little stream to\r\ncompensate for the absence of the river, to whose former existence the\r\ncliffs bore silent witness and the pines testified in sighing\r\nlamentations all the day long. On the east the lake swept inland in a\r\ngradual curve to the piers and wharves of a city with a cloud of smoke\r\nhanging above its spires, and then outward again to a wooded point\r\ntwelve miles away, the eastern boundary of the bay. Looking north, we\r\ncould see only water, apparently as deep as the ocean: no land was\r\nvisible on the Canadian horizon, no island to break the harmony--nothing\r\nbut vessels sailing gayly toward the east or tacking patiently toward\r\nthe west, some distinct and snowy, others dark in the distance, and all\r\nwith the graceful rigging peculiar to the lake-craft. Although November\r\nwas far advanced, the warm sunshine and soft breeze gave no indications\r\nof approaching winter: the leaves had fallen from the trees and lay in\r\nbrilliant heaps upon the ground, and children running through the groves\r\nwaded in their glowing masses and tossed them high in the air with many\r\na shout and half-finished song. The bare branches basked motionless in\r\nthe hazy warmth, and the brown and empty farm-lands expanded their broad\r\nbreasts to the heat, the care of the crops well over, the last sheaf\r\nsafely housed and their labors ended. Nature works hard in these Western\r\nfields, conquering them from the forest, redeeming them from the swamp\r\nand tending the delicate grain amid the rank growth of prairie-grass;\r\nbut when the last load is driven home and the last leaf has fallen, then\r\nshe rests, and the hazy atmosphere and peculiar stillness mark her\r\nrepose. Indian summer! what is it? It is Nature's _dolce far niente_,\r\nher one holiday. Wise will he be who, working with her through the\r\ndreary winter, the budding spring, yes, and even the sultry summer,\r\nearns the right to rest with her in Indian summer, the vacation of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWe had come from the East to visit friends at the West, from a venerable\r\nvillage on the Atlantic Ocean to a new city on the Western lake-shore;\r\nand although we acknowledged that the country was advancing with the\r\nstrides of a giant, we also maintained that the charm of old\r\nassociations, the mystery of the past, the interest of stirring events,\r\nwere all wanting, and therefore the West, prosperous as it was, could\r\nnot be compared to the rock-bound coasts of New England or the\r\nbeautiful shores of New York Bay, so filled with legends and adventures,\r\nmemories of the past, battles and shipwrecks, all dating back before the\r\nfirst axe resounded in the Western wilderness. Everything here was new.\r\nThere were no houses with the marks of Revolutionary bullets, no\r\nfamilies of unbroken aristocratic descent from over the ocean, no\r\ntraditions of Colonial times, no stories of danger, no interesting\r\nrelics: a few tales of pioneer life, a few encounters with the Indians,\r\ncomposed the annals of the town; and the prosaic reality of its life was\r\nas new and glaring as the white paint on its houses.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts we expressed to Uncle John as he joined us on the beach,\r\nbringing the baskets containing our picnic dinner: over the sandwiches,\r\ncakes and native Catawba we dilated upon the subject, and invited him to\r\nvisit us at Winthrop, where the very atmosphere was redolent with old\r\nassociations and the beach a treasure-house of strange relics. Our quiet\r\nuncle smiled as we talked, and when we had finished our lunch and\r\nclimbed the cliff he took us to a pleasant stone house and introduced us\r\nto its owner, a silver-haired gentleman of the old school, whose\r\npersonal appearance and courtly manners filled us with admiration and\r\nrespect. Living thus quietly on the lake-shore, this man of learning and\r\nscience had spent many years absorbed in natural history and its kindred\r\npursuits, in close communion with Nature, loved by his neighbors and\r\nhonored by the naturalists of the whole country for his persevering\r\nindustry and valuable discoveries. Surrounded by his birds, bees and\r\nflowers, the beautiful old man received us with kindly courtesy, and\r\nfrom him we heard a story of the past, authenticated by records and old\r\nletters, and illustrated by relics found on the beach below, washed up\r\nby the waves or exposed to view by the shifting of the sands. Deeply\r\ninterested in the narrative, we yet found it hard to believe that the\r\npeaceful hazy lake and the little stream rippling over the bar had ever\r\nbeen the scene of the raging tempest, desolation and death described in\r\nthe story. But as we drove homeward in the evening the sun went down in\r\na lurid cloud, and a wind came driving up from the east, whirling the\r\ndry leaves in circles and blowing the dust in eddies at the corners of\r\nthe streets. All night it raged over land and water, increasing to a\r\ngale as the pale dawn broke, lashing the lake into a sheet of foam, and\r\ngrowing colder and colder as the flying watery clouds obscured the sun\r\nand the dismal day waxed and waned. With our faces pressed against the\r\nwindow-panes we watched the fresh-water sea in its fury. Out in the\r\noffing several vessels were scudding under bare poles, and a steamer\r\ntrying to make the harbor was blown over almost horizontally in the\r\nwater before she reached the piers. Darkness fell and the wind howled\r\nover the city, changing to the north and bringing a storm of sleet and\r\nsnow in its train, so that the ground was white when daylight broke, and\r\nthe air so thick with the stinging hail that we could not see the lake.\r\nAnxiously we waited, but in vain: our thoughts were with the sailors out\r\non the raging waters. Not until twilight did the atmosphere grow clear;\r\nand as an angry gleam of sunshine shot from under the heavy bank of\r\nclouds, we saw two schooners, one near the shore, the other out on the\r\nhorizon, driving before the gale.\r\n\r\n\"Are they in danger, Uncle John?\" we asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I should say so, although I am no sailor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do not the tugs go out to help them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Each one for himself, my two little nieces. The tugs could do nothing\r\nin such a sea.\"\r\n\r\nAnother night came, and after its long hours had passed the sky grew\r\nclearer and the gale abated: there was still a high wind and the dark\r\nlake looked threatening, but the worst was over, at least for the time.\r\nOne of the schooners had disappeared, but the other was coming in under\r\na rag of a sail, plunging and almost unmanageable. As she neared the\r\nshore a tug ventured out, and succeeded in reaching her safely, but\r\nclose to the end of the pier a furious gust broke the fastenings and\r\nthrew the vessel up on the stone foundation of an old wharf at the\r\nwestern side of the entrance, where she pounded to pieces in a few\r\nmoments. The crew made desperate efforts to escape, and we could see\r\ntheir black forms clinging to the spars and the logs of the wharf\r\nbetween the waves. All possible aid was given, and all but one were\r\nsaved: he, poor fellow! was washed out to sea and lost.\r\n\r\n\"A cruel lake!\" exclaimed Ada. \"Who would suppose that such a\r\ncomparatively small body of water could rival the great ocean in\r\ndanger?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a storm navigation is more dangerous on our Western lakes than on\r\nthe ocean,\" said Uncle John: \"there is not space enough for safety, and\r\nthe short waves and narrow channels require more skill than the broad\r\nsweep of the ocean. There is always a lee shore near, and you cannot run\r\naway from it, as you can at sea.\"\r\n\r\nAt noon the wind had somewhat subsided, and a faint sunshine gleamed\r\nthrough the ragged clouds. Driving out to the scene of our picnic a few\r\ndays before, we stood on the edge of the cliff and watched the great\r\nwaves come rolling in and dash against the rocks sixty feet in the air,\r\nso that our faces were wet with their spray. The little river was white\r\nwith surf rushing in over the bar: not a leaf remained on the bare\r\nground, the naked trees tossed their arms wildly to and fro, and the\r\npines were coated with ice. A short distance to the west a boy pointed\r\nout some timbers floating in the surf. \"Them's the schooner that come\r\nashore last night,\" he explained. \"This here beach is a bad place in a\r\nstorm. The crew's all drownded: guess the bodies will be coming ashore\r\nin a few days.\" We turned away with a shudder. The story of the\r\nsilver-haired professor came vividly back to our minds. We relate it in\r\nalmost his own words, as it forms part of the unwritten history of\r\nante-Revolutionary times, but vaguely known and appreciated by this busy\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1763 the great conspiracy of the North-western\r\nIndians, headed by Pontiac, the celebrated chief, made its first\r\ndemonstration against the whites. By the influence and wisdom of Pontiac\r\nthe attack was simultaneous upon every fort and post in the West, and\r\nthe result successful for the conqueror and disastrous for the\r\nconquered. Had the Indians possessed many chiefs endowed with the energy\r\nand prudence of this remarkable red man, their history would not be\r\nmerely a monotonous repetition of defeat and extermination. But it was\r\nnot to be: the stars in their courses fought against Sisera. After the\r\nmassacre, the British, awakened to the power of their savage foes,\r\nendeavored to send troops across the country to the relief of the\r\ngarrisons at Forts Pitt and Detroit, the only posts which had escaped\r\ndestruction; and in the fall of the same year a number of batteaux\r\nloaded with troops and supplies started from Albany, by way of the\r\nMohawk, and after stopping at the fort on the Niagara River, entered\r\nLake Erie, intending to coast along the southern shore to Detroit. One\r\ncan easily imagine the scene. Six hundred regulars with their officers,\r\na train of artillery and supplies, and the boatmen, who were probably\r\nthe hardy, merry voyageurs, sailing over the placid lake covered with\r\nthe purple haze of the Indian summer, camping on the beach at night,\r\ntheir fires shining through the silent forest where now towns and cities\r\ndot the shore. They passed the mouth of the Cuyahoga in safety, and\r\nsteered northward to clear the bold headland covered with evergreens\r\nknown as the Point-aux-Pins, when suddenly a gale came upon them,\r\ndarkness fell, and, tossing on the furious waves, they knew not where to\r\nsteer, even if their frail boats had not become unmanageable in the\r\nstorm. Separated from each other, shipping water at every plunge, they\r\ndrifted toward the shore, and finding the mouth of Rocky River close\r\nupon them, they made a desperate effort to enter, hoping to find a\r\nharbor where they could obtain shelter. The channel is very narrow, and\r\nbut few of the boats succeeded in entering, the rest being cast upon\r\nthe rocks, engulfed in the surf or stranded on the bar, where the waves\r\nsoon tore them to pieces. In the darkness, amid the roaring of the winds\r\nand waters, the survivors rushed wildly to and fro, seeking to climb the\r\nperpendicular rock wet with spray, and falling headlong in the seething\r\nwaves below. The only route to the plateau above was through a ravine\r\nwithin the point, and when the stormy morning broke, through this gully\r\nthe dispirited soldiers climbed to the summit of the cliff, and, making\r\na fire, dried their clothing and cooked a scanty meal. Here they\r\nremained during the storm, probably for three days, crowded within a\r\ncircle of boulders, and relieving each other in the watch on the beach\r\nas the bodies of their drowned comrades came ashore--seventy men and\r\nthree officers, Lieutenant Davidson, Lieutenant Paynter, and the\r\nsurgeon, Dr. Williams of the Eightieth Regiment. When the storm ceased,\r\nthe dead were buried, the remaining boats repaired, and the forlorn band\r\nstarted back down the lake, unable to render any assistance to the\r\nbesieged garrison at Detroit on account of the loss of their ammunition\r\nand arms.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of the next year, 1764, General Bradstreet with three\r\nthousand men opened a campaign against the Indians on Lake Erie, and\r\nafter various successes and defeats started in batteaux from Sandusky\r\nBay to coast down the lake, his forces consisting of British regulars,\r\nprovincials and a large body of Indian allies. It is probable that the\r\nbeautiful autumn weather peculiar to the Western lakes deceived him as\r\nit had deceived Major Wilkins in the preceding year, for when a sudden\r\ngale overtook him, surprised and confused, he ran the boats ashore on an\r\nopen beach, where twenty-five were broken into fragments by the surf,\r\nand six cannon, together with most of the ammunition and baggage, were\r\nlost. This open beach was within a mile of the scene of the previous\r\nyear's disaster. As before, the storm continued three days, and many of\r\nthe men were lost, swept away by the waves and overcome with hunger and\r\nfatigue. When the skies cleared, Bradstreet reviewed his diminished\r\nforces, and after burying the remaining cannon and ammunition, started\r\nonward with the regulars in the batteaux which had escaped the storm,\r\nleaving the provincials and Indians to make their way by land, on foot\r\nand without provisions, four hundred miles through the forest as best\r\nthey could. These provincials came from New York, Connecticut and New\r\nJersey, and were commanded by Major Israel Putnam, afterward\r\nmajor-general in the United States army. The story of their terrible\r\njourney is unwritten, but it is known that many died of slow starvation\r\nand fatigue along the route, which led through swamps and thickets, with\r\ndeep rivers barring their path; and not until the last of December did\r\nthey reach the forts, after having been twelve weeks in the wilderness.\r\nThe number of those who perished in the wreck or died on the journey is\r\nnot recorded, but it was so large as to occasion petitions to the\r\ngovernment--an unusual proceeding at that early date.\r\n\r\nThese are the narratives as compiled from authorities most vague and\r\ndiverse, and yet, when taken together, most indisputable. At that time,\r\nbefore the Revolution, when, save a narrow belt on the Atlantic coast,\r\nthe whole country was a forest, authentic news was rare, and records\r\ncarelessly kept, if kept at all. Soldiers marching hundreds of miles\r\nthrough a wilderness had no time to compose elaborate journals, and had\r\nsomething else to think of than the curiosity of posterity. When a man\r\nlives in a state of uncertainty as to his scalp, we cannot expect from\r\nhim systematic habits of writing; and therefore we are compelled to call\r\nupon the earth and sea for information concerning these early\r\nadventures. Generously have they responded, producing silent witnesses\r\nwho tell the tale of disaster with a melancholy fidelity more real than\r\nthe printed page.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time after heavy storms portions of the old batteaux have\r\nbeen thrown up on the Rocky River beach. One of these fragments was a\r\nbow-stem chafed and water-soaked, the iron ring-bolt secured by a\r\nnut--both covered with rust. From its appearance it had evidently been\r\nfor a long time buried in the sand. In ploughing a field on the\r\nbottom-lands the nails, rudder-hangings, bow-ring and other irons of a\r\nboat were discovered, together with a heap of ashes: having been cast\r\nhigh and dry upon the shore by the waves, no doubt this batteau was\r\nburned to keep it from falling into the enemy's hands.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, during a severe gale, the sand-bar shifted its position at the\r\nmouth of the river, and from the quantity of gun-flints, brass\r\nmusket-guards, musket-barrels and bayonets washed ashore it became\r\nevident that one of the submerged boats had been uncovered and broken\r\nup, after having been in the sand nearly a century.\r\n\r\nThe beach beyond Rock River, although a good fishing-ground, has been\r\nabandoned on account of the hidden obstacles which cut and break the\r\nnets: these are without doubt portions of Bradstreet's batteaux; and\r\nconcealed in the same locality are probably some of the cannon, as\r\nsix-pound cannon balls have been discovered there. Along this beach many\r\nrelics have been found, and every storm washes up new ones: bayonets,\r\nmuskets and bullets are to be seen in most of the houses of the\r\nneighborhood, preserved as curiosities. Silver teaspoons have been found\r\nin several places: they are of antique design, heavily moulded, and\r\nengraved with various initials. No doubt they belonged to the British\r\nofficers. An ancient and elaborately finished sword was discovered on\r\nthe beach, with the hilt terminating in a lion's head of solid silver:\r\nthe guard was also of silver.\r\n\r\nOn the land, traces of the soldiers are numerous. In one of the ravines\r\nleading up from the narrow beach a bayonet was found firmly thrust into\r\nthe clay about six feet from the bottom, which had evidently been used\r\nas a fixture by which the soldiers drew themselves up to the top of the\r\nbank; and on the plateau a circle of boulders with the ashes of a fire\r\nwas found in ploughing, together with a case-knife. Near by the blade of\r\na surgeon's amputating knife was discovered in the soil; and this\r\nrelic, perhaps the most indisputable one yet found, probably belonged to\r\nSurgeon Williams of Wilkins's expedition, lost on the point in 1763.\r\n\r\nA mound not far from the locality of the camp-fire had long been avoided\r\nby the settlers on account of the human bones within it. Recent\r\ninvestigations have shown it to be composed of skeletons arranged in\r\ntiers, with earth thrown over the whole, and the skulls have been\r\nidentified as those of Anglo-Saxons, with a few Indian skulls mixed\r\namong them. Here, then, the survivors buried their dead comrades,\r\nEnglish soldiers left behind, cold and still, on the shores of the\r\nWestern lake. No doubt as the boats started from the point there were\r\nsome who looked back at the new mound with sad regret for such a\r\nburial-place. But what difference will it make when the earth and sea\r\ngive up their dead? He who made us will keep us in safety, no matter\r\nwhere we lie.\r\n\r\nThe route of the provincials and Indians left by Bradstreet to find\r\ntheir way by land is marked by various objects dropped at the start or\r\nsoon after. A stack of bayonets covered with soil and rubbish was found\r\npiled systematically at the foot of a tree, forgotten perhaps, or else\r\nleft behind as too heavy for the long journey. A musket barrel was also\r\nfound enclosed in a fork of a tree by the growth of the wood: it had\r\nbeen placed in an inclined position, and had remained undisturbed until\r\nthe tree had completely enveloped it. A number of gun-flints, a peck or\r\nmore, were ploughed up on the high ground back of the lake, also a\r\nsword and bayonets. Farther on, French and English coins bearing the\r\ndate of 1714 were found, and in another locality a silver teaspoon and\r\nsome pennies of 1749: these articles were probably thrown down in\r\ndiscarded clothing or knapsacks.\r\n\r\nEvery year discoveries are made of articles thrown up by the waves,\r\nwashed out of the cliffs or ploughed up in the fields. Many of these\r\nrelics are in the possession of the silver-haired professor, who has\r\nstudied the localities and invested the point with a legendary interest\r\nrare in this busy West. When we recall the early date of these\r\nexpeditions, the great loss of life, the tragic scenes on the shore, and\r\nthe terrible journey of the provincials through the forest, we must feel\r\nthat the story with its silent illustrations is as worthy of a place in\r\nAmerican history as many other events of less interest, whose minutest\r\ndetails have been described over and over again in the current\r\nliterature of the day.\r\n\r\nIn the words of the venerable professor: \"The correctness of my\r\nconclusions will be confirmed by an examination of the peculiar and\r\ndangerous character of these localities during a storm, and of the\r\nmanner in which these vestiges must have been lost; and a more complete\r\ncomprehension of the terrific scenes attendant on those disasters would\r\nthereby be gained, together with a full conception of the horrors of the\r\ncatastrophe. Few of the present generation know that either of these\r\nevents have occurred: fewer still are aware of the pecuniary loss and\r\nhuman suffering they involved.\"\r\n\r\nCONSTANCE FENIMORE WOOLSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FRIEND OF MY CHILDHOOD.\r\n\r\nI suppose I must have pulled the bell very hard that day, for otherwise\r\nI don't think she would have kept me waiting twenty minutes, as she did.\r\n_She_ was only my mother's servant-woman, whose duty was to wait upon\r\nthe dinner-table and the door, the latter function being the more\r\nonerous one. Looking back at my conduct over the lapse of eighteen\r\nyears, I am disposed to acknowledge that she was right in the abstract\r\nin punishing the inconsiderate impatience which made me keep the\r\ndoor-bell upon a continuous ring till I was let in. But how wrong did\r\nthe event prove her! Scarcely was I warmed up to my work, when, turning\r\nmy head, I saw a tall gentleman with broad shoulders and a round face,\r\nwhose look, at first one of inquiry, and perhaps bewilderment as he\r\ntried to distinguish the house he was in search of from among a dozen,\r\nall characterized by that unity of design which in Philadelphia strikes\r\nforcibly the intelligent foreigner, suddenly changed to one of\r\namusement, not, I thought then, unmixed with approval, as he caught\r\nsight of me at my reprehensible employment. And as I rang with a\r\npersistency which nothing can now call from me, he stood on the bottom\r\nstep (for it was my mother whom he had come to see) with that expression\r\nin which I found so little discouragement, still looking forth from\r\nthose great eyes of his, which had pierced deeply and sternly so many of\r\nthe false and hollow things of this world, and which now, not, I am\r\nsure, for the first time, were bent kindly down upon a rude boy and his\r\nruder pranks. How little did the latter know about the tall gentleman,\r\nand how little too would he have cared even if he had known all there\r\nwas to know about him:--known that then the age was beginning to\r\nrecognize its philosopher, whose lessons, sharp and bitter enough at\r\nfirst, were to make it better and truer and purer, if such a thing were\r\npossible of accomplishment.\r\n\r\nBut that he was tall I did know, and my standard of eminence was a\r\npurely physical one. Five feet eight I did not despise, but six feet\r\nalone commanded absolute and genuine respect; and he, I believe, stood\r\nsix feet one. The presumption which could keep such a height of\r\nperfection waiting at the front door shocked me beyond expression. No,\r\nnot beyond expression, for the triumphant yell with which the hapless\r\nservant-girl was greeted when at last she admitted me, and I burst in\r\nexclaiming, \"You have kept the tall gentleman waiting half an hour!\"\r\nmust have given, I think, some adequate idea of my feelings. To that\r\nincident may I not justly look back with satisfaction? Am I not right in\r\ntaking pride to myself for having amused for so long a time one whose\r\nmomentary attention the witty and the wise have thought it no slight\r\nthing to have gained? And--who knows?--perhaps he himself did not\r\naltogether forget it, and with the two sturdy _Buben_ on the Rhine-boat,\r\nand those little men he used to meet at Eton or on the play-ground of\r\nthe Charterhouse, may not the American boy also have found a place in\r\nhis kindly memory? But I wish it clearly understood that I did not force\r\nmyself upon his acquaintance: no lion-hunting can be laid to my charge.\r\nOn the contrary, after giving him a glance of approbation for proving\r\nsuch an effectual weapon to me in subduing my enemy in the gate--or\r\nrather the enemy whose offence was that she was anywhere but in the\r\ngate--I did not, I can truly say, bestow another thought upon him till I\r\nwas sent for to afford him, at his own special request, the honor of\r\nknowing me. Were there no servants in the kitchen to be tormented? No\r\ncats in the back yard to be chased with wild halloo? No rowdy boys in\r\nthe alley with whom to fraternize over pies of communistic mud? No\r\nlittle sister up stairs much nicer than any tall gentleman, even though\r\nhe might have come from across the ocean and be thought a great deal of\r\nby the grown-up people, that I should go out of my way to see him, and\r\nabandon my cherished pursuits to listen to him talking of what I did not\r\nunderstand, and did not believe was worth understanding? No: my position\r\nwas a high one, and I kept to it, for, though I gave up my occupations a\r\nlittle while and went down to the parlor, it was simply because\r\npoliteness and filial obedience were the ruling motives of my conduct.\r\nOf the first formal introduction to my friend I have but a shadowy\r\nrecollection. He said, I think, that he wanted to know the impetuous\r\nlittle boy he had met outside; but nothing more which I can recall. My\r\nown share in the conversation has entirely faded from my memory: it is\r\nprobable indeed that I had no share in it at all, being less at my ease\r\nin the conventional sphere of a drawing-room than in the more\r\nunconstrained atmosphere of a back alley. Yet in hours of depression,\r\nwhen, in spite of the most sincere desire to think favorably of mankind,\r\nI cannot fail to notice that I am not appreciated as I should be by the\r\nundiscerning world, and my soul seeks consolation and forgetfulness from\r\nhigher sources, I half believe that when he went back to his own\r\ncountry, and spoke there, as I have heard he did very often, of the\r\npleasant people he had met here, of the American friends he valued so\r\nmuch, it was perhaps not without an _arrière-pensée_ of his noisy\r\nacquaintance of the doorstep in Locust street.\r\n\r\nThe intercourse so tempestuously begun was threatened with an early\r\nextinction, for my newly acquired friend returned soon after this to his\r\nhome, where were the two little girls whom he was fond of describing\r\nwhile saying that he would not dare to bring them to this country, lest\r\nthey should come to despise the simple muslin gowns with which they were\r\nthen quite content; home to the toil of the hard-worked brain, the\r\nsteady labor of the untiring pen, which was to give us before it rested\r\nfor ever nothing indeed like his earlier works, but much which we shall\r\nnot willingly let die; home to England, in truth, but only that, having\r\nwritten the story of certain of its kings, as he had before written the\r\nworthier history of some of its unsceptred monarchs, whose sovereign\r\nsway is over our spirits still, he might come again across the ocean to\r\ngreet all who should wish to hear him tell of the Britain of a century\r\npast, when our own history had as yet scarcely seen the conclusion of\r\nits opening chapter; giving as he did, so minute, life-like details\r\nrelating to the great men of that time, whose familiar names were to\r\nmost of his hearers not much more than names, but which, thanks in great\r\npart to him, are now as household words. And so we met, and being two\r\nyears older, I was accorded the honor of becoming one of his auditors,\r\ngoing with my mother to hear each of his lectures. We sat in a box on\r\none side of the stage in Concert Hall, and at this moment I recall the\r\ntall, dignified figure standing before the desk on which were placed his\r\nnotes, and the crowded room full of indistinguishable attentive faces. I\r\nsometimes fancy too that I cannot have forgotten what are now favorite\r\npassages from those lectures--passages read and re-read, and then read\r\nagain, till they are known almost by heart. I cannot acknowledge to\r\nmyself that I do not remember his voice and look, and the tribute of\r\nlistening silence which waited upon him while he spoke.\r\n\r\nOne at least of these evenings is well remembered. Its distinguishing\r\nfeature was my being tipped. My mother and I had gone on this occasion\r\nquite early to our places--half an hour or three-quarters before the\r\ntime when the lecture should begin--and we found the lecturer already at\r\nhis post. He, with head thrown back, had been walking with long strides\r\nup and down the little waiting-room, and talking in bright spirits to my\r\nmother, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him, and diving into one\r\nof his pockets he brought out a sovereign--perhaps it was a five-dollar\r\ngold piece--and insisted upon giving it to me; but the proposal produced\r\nat once a most severe parental resistance, while I disinterestedly\r\nlooked on--a resistance apparently quite unlooked for by \"my illustrious\r\nfriend,\" who had much trouble in explaining that this species of\r\nbeneficence was a thing of course in England. But American pride was\r\nsilenced at last, though not convinced, as will be seen, for it planned\r\non the spot a compromise which should reconcile the differences of\r\nnational feeling, though _I_ was induced to suppose that the sovereign\r\nwas as far out of my reach as ever; and being then, as I said before,\r\nabove or below such things, I turned all my attention to the lecture,\r\nwhich began soon afterward, and whose subject, the royal bugbear of\r\npatriotic schoolboys of that time, I imagined I knew all about. It was\r\ntherefore with astonished awe that I heard the peroration, when the\r\nspeaker said, appealing directly to us all: \"O brothers speaking the\r\nsame dear mother-tongue! O comrades! enemies no more, let us take a\r\nmournful hand together as we stand by this royal corpse and call a truce\r\nto battle! Low he lies to whom the proudest used to kneel once, and who\r\nwas cast lower than the poorest--dead whom millions prayed for in vain.\r\nDriven off his throne, buffeted by rude hands, with his children in\r\nrevolt, the darling of his old age killed before him untimely--our Lear\r\nhangs over her breathless lips and cries, Cordelia! Cordelia! stay a\r\nlittle!\r\n\r\n    Vex not his ghost: oh, let him pass! He hates him\r\n    That would upon the rack of this tough world\r\n    Stretch him out longer.\r\n\r\nHush, strife and quarrel, over the solemn grave! Sound, trumpets, a\r\nmournful march. Fall, dark curtain, upon his pageant, his pride, his\r\ngrief, his awful tragedy.\" This view of the subject was altogether new.\r\n\r\nThe compromise just spoken of--and I must bring to an end my story,\r\nalready too long--consisted in the expenditure of the five-dollar piece\r\nin two of the books written by the bestower of that inflammatory coin.\r\nI open the volumes of _Pendennis_ and _Vanity Fair_ which have been\r\nlying at my elbow, and across the title-page of each I see written, in\r\ncuriously small and delicate hand, \"---- ----, with W. M. Thackeray's\r\nkind regards. April, 1856.\" These were the books.\r\n\r\nH. R.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMLET IN A FRENCH DRESS.\r\n\r\nIf any one, on a rainy day or a lonely evening, wishes to drive away the\r\nblue devils by the perusal of some laughter-compelling volume, we can\r\nrecommend for the purpose no better reading than the tragedy of _Hamlet_\r\ndone into French verse by the Chevalier de Chatelain, a gentleman well\r\nknown as a very successful translator of English poetry. With singular\r\ngood sense and feeling he has selected, not the play as Shakespeare\r\nwrote it, but the stage-version thereof, as the foundation of his work.\r\nFor which Heaven be praised! for what he has done is sufficient, in all\r\nconscience. Not that his translation is totally devoid of merit. On the\r\ncontrary, some passages are admirably rendered, and give the sense and\r\nsound of the original in a manner really remarkable when the difference\r\nbetween the two languages is considered. But there is such a calm\r\nconviction on M. de Chatelain's part that he is doing his work\r\nfaultlessly, that, in view of the ludicrous errors, additions and\r\nvariations with which his text abounds, the effect is irresistible.\r\n\r\nFor instance, to begin at the beginning, the phrase\r\n\r\n    Looks it not like the king?\r\n\r\nis translated\r\n\r\n    C'est le roi _tout craché_.\r\n\r\nAnd in the same scene--\r\n\r\n    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\r\n    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,\r\n    For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,\r\n\r\nis rendered--\r\n\r\n    Si, prévaricateur, tu volas des trésors\r\n    Par ton ordre enfouis dans le sein de la terre,\r\n    De tels fails vous font faire _école buissonière_\r\n    À vous autres esprits.\r\n\r\nIn the next scene we are treated to a small specimen of M. de\r\nChatelain's genius as an emendator of Shakespeare. For no one can\r\nconsider this passage a translation of the text:\r\n\r\n    Venez, Dame, venez. Ce J'y consens si doux,\r\n    Si spontané de Hamlet m'enchante et m'enivre.\r\n    C'est pour moi _le charmant feuillet d'un charmant livre._\r\n\r\nThat charming page of a delightful book will, we think, be sought for in\r\nthe original in vain. Still more delicious is the interpellation into\r\nHamlet's first soliloquy of the following lines, referring to the\r\n\"unweeded garden\":\r\n\r\n            Ces jours qu'on nous montre superbes\r\n    Sont un vilain jardin, rempli de folles herbes,\r\n    Qui donnent de l'ivraie et certes rien de plus,\r\n    Si ce n'est les engins du _choléra morbus_.\r\n\r\nAngels and ministers of grace, defend us! When _did_ Hamlet talk about\r\nthe cholera morbus?\r\n\r\nPassing over some minor variations, we come to the brief closing\r\nsoliloquy of the scene:\r\n\r\n    My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;\r\n    I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!\r\n\r\nThus Shakespeare, and thus M. de Chatelain:\r\n\r\n    Le spectre de mon père--armé! Vraiment ça cloche!\r\n    Je flaire, je le crains, _quelqu' anguille sous roche_!\r\n\r\nDoubtless Hamlet did \"smell a rat,\" but this is the first intimation we\r\nhave had of his scenting an eel.\r\n\r\nThus Hamlet addresses the ghost:\r\n\r\n    Mais oh dis moi, pourquoi tes ossemens par chance\r\n    Déposés dans la tombe, out brisé leurs liens,\r\n    Pour te jeter ici _comme une langue aux chiens_.\r\n\r\nProbably the \"ponderous and marble jaws\" suggested this extraordinary\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nIn the next, act, evidently thinking that poor Ophelia has been\r\nneglected by her creator, M. de Chatelain makes Polonius speak of her to\r\nthe king and queen as \"un vrai morceau de roi\"--a gentle method of\r\nsuggesting that she is worthy of the distinguished honor of a royal\r\nalliance. But the fair Ophelia is destined to suffer nearly as unkind\r\ntreatment from the hands of her French usher as she endures from her\r\nprincely lover. We give entire the translation of her beautiful lament,\r\nwhich begins--\r\n\r\n    O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!\r\n\r\nand which M. de Chatelain thus renders:\r\n\r\n    Oh! quelle triste fin pour si grande épopée\r\n    Le soldat, l'érudit, l'oeil, la langue et l'épée,\r\n    Tout cela culbuté--perdu. Le noble espoir,\r\n    La fleur de ce pays--le plus riant miroir\r\n    De la mode toujours;--le plus parfait modèle\r\n    De gout;--des observes la plus _fine dentelle_--\r\n    Entièrement à bas! oui, _sans ressource_ à bas!\r\n    Et moi qui dans ses voeux trouvais tant de soulas,\r\n    Qui du miel _de ses vers_ ai sucé la musique,\r\n    De sa raison je vois descendre la tunique\r\n    Sur moi, malheur!... C'est comme au lointain le tin-tin\r\n    De la cloche ... de près qui se change en tocsin.\r\n    De tout ce que j'ai vu conserver souvenance\r\n    Et voir ce que je vois! Quelle désespérance!\r\n\r\nWe are at a loss which to admire most--Ophelia sucking the music from\r\nHamlet's honeyed verses, or the \"sweet bells\" whose tin-tin changes to a\r\ntocsin, or the comparison of Hamlet to fine lace, or the \"melancholy\r\nending to a grand epic.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage--\r\n\r\n    We shall obey, were she ten times our mother,\r\n\r\nis thus translated:\r\n\r\n    Nous obeirons, plutôt dix fois qu'une. N'est elle pas notre mere?\r\n\r\nM. de Chatelain confesses in a note that his translation is not in\r\naccordance with the text, but he adds: \"Nous ne concevons pas la penée\r\nainsi exprimée.\" It is a good thing for Shakespeare that he has found a\r\nFrench commentator who understands what he meant to say better than he\r\ndid himself.\r\n\r\nOphelia's first exclamation in the mad scene, \"Where is the beauteous\r\nmajesty of Denmark?\" is translated,\r\n\r\n    De Danemarck où donc est _la reine jolie_?\r\n\r\nSuch an epithet applied to the middle-aged and matronly Gertrude, the\r\nmother of the thirty-years'-old Hamlet, is pretty--very pretty, indeed.\r\nA few pages farther on the \"bonny-sweet Robin\" of Ophelia's song is\r\nsupposed by the translator to be a bird, as he thus renders the passage:\r\n\r\n    Car le gentil Robin n'est un oiseau de proie,\r\n    Il fait tout ma joie!\r\n\r\nIt is also exceedingly amusing to note how the old adjective \"whoreson\"\r\nbothers M. de Chatelain, who seems to consider it a word of weight and\r\nmeaning. The \"whoreson dead body\" of the gravediggers' scene is turned\r\ninto \"le cadavre des enfants de nos mères;\" and in like manner that\r\n\"whoreson mad fellow Yorick\" is presented to us as \"un fou né d'une\r\nfille à la morale elastique.\"\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of _Hamlet_ by Ducis does no wrong to the manes of\r\nShakespeare, for though the title-page declares that it is \"imitated\r\nfrom the English,\" nothing is left of Shakespeare's play save the names\r\nand the fact that Hamlet's father had been murdered before the action of\r\nthe drama begins. Hamlet is the reigning king of Denmark, Claudius is\r\nfirst prince of the blood and father of Ophelia, and Polonius is an\r\nordinary conspirator. There is no ghost and no gravedigger. Ophelia does\r\nnot go mad, there is no fencing-scene, and Hamlet, after declaiming\r\nthrough innumerable pages in the set style of French classic tragedy,\r\nsolemnly stabs Claudius, and then declares that as he is a king he must\r\nconsent to live for the good of his people.\r\n\r\nL. H. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTES OF PUBLIC WORTHIES.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON. One day, in a fit of abstraction the juvenile George\r\ncut down Bushrod's favorite cherry tree with a hatchet. His purpose was\r\nto cut--and run.\r\n\r\nBut the old gentleman came sailing round the corner of the barn just as\r\nthe future Father of his Country had started on the retreat.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, sonny,\" thundered the stern old Virginian, \"who cut that\r\ntree down?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge reflected a moment. There wasn't another boy or another hatchet\r\nwithin fifteen miles. Besides, it occurred to him that to be virtuous is\r\nto be happy. Just as Washington senior turned to go in and get his\r\nhorsewhip, our little hero burst into tears, and, nestling among his\r\nfather's coat-tails, exclaimed, \"Father, I cannot tell a lie. It must\r\nhave been a frost.\"\r\n\r\n\"My son, my son,\" stammered the fond parent as he made a pass for his\r\noff-spring, \"when you get to be first in war and first in peace, just\r\ncover your back-pay into the Treasury, and the newspaper press will\r\nrespect you!\"\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN. Early in the war a party of distinguished gentlemen\r\nfrom New England called on Mr. Lincoln to urge the appointment of a\r\ncertain Mr. Brown to the post of quarter-master. The President, who was\r\namusing himself by splitting portions of the staircase of the White\r\nHouse into rails, received them cordially. They stated their errand in\r\nan earnest but respectful tone, and calmly awaited his answer. Mr.\r\nLincoln, drawing himself up to his full height and clapping the\r\nspokesman of the party on the shoulder, began to tell a story about a\r\ndog-fight he once saw in Kentucky.\r\n\r\nBy and by it had gradually grown dark: several hours had passed away,\r\nand neither dog appeared to get killed or to gain any advantage over the\r\nother. One by one the party had dropped out, till the leader (who did\r\nnot wish to disturb Mr. Lincoln's hold on his shoulder) was left alone,\r\ntrying to conceal a yawn and to look interested. Suddenly, Mr. Lincoln,\r\nwith that peculiar smile on his countenance which Mr. Carpenter can talk\r\nabout, but can't paint, remarked, \"By the way, my friend, I'm sorry for\r\nBrown, but I gave that appointment to the other man yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER. The following anecdote of the great Massachusetts\r\nstatesman has never before appeared in print:\r\n\r\nOne day, Clay, Webster and Calhoun met upon the steps of the Capitol.\r\nMr. Clay ventured to remark, in his most affable style, that it looked\r\nlike rain. Calhoun looked wise, but said nothing. Evidently he took in\r\nthe whole situation at a glance. It was a crisis for Webster. Carefully\r\nlaying his thumb behind the third brass button of his blue coat, he\r\ngazed from out of those cavernous eyes and grandly uttered these\r\nprophetic words: \"No, gentlemen, the American people will never forsake\r\nthe Constitution. We shall have fair weather.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it proved.\r\n\r\nALONZO SAVAGE. This time it was the pupil who put the question. The\r\nSabbath-school teacher encouraged her children to bring each a Scripture\r\nquestion to be propounded to the class. Alonzo Savage said he would like\r\nto be told why St. Stephen was like a thanksgiving raisin? He allowed\r\nit was because they stoned him.\r\n\r\nThat boy has grown up and entered on a career of usefulness. He gets\r\nsteady wages as a railroad brakeman, and last week he celebrated his\r\ngolden wedding. All because Alonzo was faithful at Sabbath-school.\r\n\r\nSARSFIELD YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CANADIANS.\r\n\r\nA New York oracle, discoursing lately upon Canadian affairs, concludes\r\nthat American ideas are pervading that region because the people speak\r\nof \"baggage\" and take the right hand in driving on the road. Having\r\ntraveled somewhat in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and\r\n\"the Island,\" I have never heard the term \"baggage\" used there except by\r\nAmericans, as they call people from the States. The word is invariably\r\n\"luggage\" in hotels, steamers and stage-wagons. On the road all the\r\npeople in those provinces whom I met took the left hand, and if any one\r\nshould attempt to deviate from this old custom of England, he would\r\nsurely come to grief. When Canadians take greenbacks at par, or make\r\ntheir morning porridge of corn instead of oats, perhaps they may be\r\nready for those other innovations.\r\n\r\nWhat causes the curious difference between the people on the two sides\r\nof the boundary-line? for a difference exists in customs, in appearance\r\nand in the tones of the voice. It has been a favorite theory that the\r\nNew England thinness of fibre and sharpness of voice came from the harsh\r\nclimate and piercing winds; but in Canada the climate is more severe,\r\nand the winds are as piercing, yet the faces and forms of the people are\r\nrounder and more robust, and their voices, especially those of the\r\nwomen, have a soft and mellow intonation very different from those of\r\ntheir cousins in New England. The customs and habits are also different.\r\nIn Canada one sees little of the hurried life of the States, always at\r\nhigh pressure. The people take life more easily than we do, and look\r\nless anxious. Do these differences arise from different political\r\ninstitutions, and are the burdens of life greater in a republic than\r\nunder a monarchy?\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nSelf-deception and superstition nowhere reign more supremely, at least\r\nin civilized communities, than among the wretched devotees of the\r\ngaming-table, who are ever promising themselves to quit the mad pursuit,\r\never flattering themselves that the next _coup_ will be their last, and\r\nalways expecting that some quite supernatural piece of luck in that\r\nfinal _coup_ will secure the long-sought fortune. Some time ago we\r\nreferred in a \"Note\" to the fanciful combinations which the gamesters of\r\nEurope had been making, in their play, on the numerals connected with\r\nthe death of Napoleon III. M. de Villemessant in his last work gives a\r\nvery ludicrous instance of the extent to which a superstitious gambler\r\ncan carry his belief in presentiments, in theories of luck and in\r\nprognostications. He tells us that a certain Paris vaudevillist was\r\npersuaded that if a man unexpectedly found a piece of money when\r\ndestitute, it would bring him good luck. Accordingly, before setting\r\nfoot in a gambling-house he never failed to hide--from himself--a coin\r\nin the bottom of a pocket, where he was fully determined to forget it.\r\nWhen he had lost his all (except, of course, the aforesaid lucky piece)\r\nhe would put on his overcoat, tie up his comforter, seize his umbrella,\r\nand open the door, when, all of a sudden, his hand happening to be\r\nthrust by mere chance into his watch-fob, would, wonderful to relate!\r\nhit upon the very piece whose existence he had pledged himself never to\r\nsuspect save in the case of direst need. \"What a streak of luck!\" he\r\nthen regularly exclaimed. \"I can't be mistaken, can I? It isn't a louis,\r\nany way? By George, it is! Well, if this isn't luck alive!\" Then our\r\ngood vaudevillist would hurry back, deposit his umbrella, unroll his\r\nmuffler, shed his overcoat, throw his lucky louis on the cloth--and lose\r\nit! After all, incredible as this story seems, M. Villemessant's\r\nvaudevillist is but a type of a great class of men who deceive\r\nthemselves by devices which in others they would pronounce\r\nmonstrosities of silliness, and who hug their delusions with a gravity\r\nnone the less profound from their own half consciousness of the sham.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a theory, we believe, of that profound philosopher, Mr. Weller\r\nsenior, that turnpike-keepers were confirmed misanthropes, who, after a\r\nbitter experience in life, had sought that occupation as a means of\r\nventing their spleen against everybody who should come their way. We\r\nhave never observed in our own experience--more limited, it is true,\r\nthan the meditative Tony's--that the milk of human kindness is specially\r\nsour in the breasts of tollgate-keepers; nevertheless, there are few\r\noccupations in which a man delighting to worry his fellow-creatures in a\r\nsmall way could more effectually do so. The pike-keeper inflicts daily a\r\nlegion of infinitesimal annoyances. He stops people who are in a hurry,\r\nand forces them to find change for the toll--stops them in the fierce\r\nsun, in the drenching rain, in the thick of a snow-storm or at dead of\r\nnight. He puts an ignoble end to the excited trotting-match on the road:\r\nhe alike mercilessly pulls up Paterfamilias hurrying for the doctor and\r\nthe city man struggling to catch the train. Often, though the toll\r\nitself is a trifle, yet the loss of those two minutes which would have\r\nsaved the appointment or caught the train, nay, even the bore of pulling\r\noff one's gloves and pulling out one's wallet with the mercury below\r\nzero, tries the traveler's temper. The emancipation of highways from all\r\ntaxes levied upon wayfarers is a mark of modern civilization. The\r\nmediæval plan was to extort a toll from every luckless traveler in the\r\nname of baron or bandit. In our day Algerine corsairs, Italian brigands,\r\nChinese pirates and Mexican guerillas have continued the thievish custom\r\nof \"tributes,\" and not long ago even Montana Indians established\r\nthemselves on the leading roads and levied tolls from the passers-by.\r\nThe civilized differs from the savage or feudal practice in rendering an\r\nequivalent for the contributions exacted--that is, it provides from\r\ntheir proceeds a stout bridge or a smooth turnpike, and keeps it\r\nsteadily in repair. But the county or State should take care of highways\r\nand bridges without putting an impost on travel. Especially in the\r\nsuburbs of cities is the preservation of tolls a relic of commercial\r\nbarbarism. In New England they have gradually become almost extinct,\r\ncities or counties having bought the franchises originally granted to\r\nprivate companies. These petty exactions upon the freedom of travel\r\nought to cease everywhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is well known that many persons who scrupulously refrain from\r\nperusing Lord Byron's _Don Juan_, yet enjoy witnessing Mozart's opera of\r\n_Don Giovanni_, following the libretto with assiduity, and laughing with\r\nspecial heartiness at Leporello's song as it rehearses the adventures of\r\nhis master. In the same way, many who are rather shocked at _Camille_,\r\nfind no trouble in listening to _La Traviata_, and weep for the woes of\r\n_Favorita_ when that opera thrown into the form of an English novel\r\nexcites their censure or disgust. The fact is, that the Italian\r\nlanguage, like the cloak of charity, covereth a multitude of sins. Never\r\ndid it cover them more strikingly than in an instance recounted by\r\n_L'Eclipse_. The present French government, according to that paper,\r\nlately prohibited the theatre of La Porte Saint-Martin from playing _Le\r\nRoi s'amuse_ of Victor Hugo, a piece familiar to Frenchmen in its\r\nreading edition for two-score years. The edict seems to have been rather\r\narbitrary, since, whatever its morality, at least the play could give no\r\npolitical offence, there being but the remotest kind of comparison\r\npossible between the court of Francis I. and the government of Marshal\r\nMacMahon. But be this as it may, on the very day after its prohibition\r\nof _Le Roi s'amuse_ the government inserted in its budget a subvention\r\nof a hundred thousand francs for the Théâtre Italien, whose favorite\r\nperformance is _Rigoletto_. Now, _Rigoletto_ is only a bad Italian\r\ntranslation of _Le Roi s'amuse_; so that the droll spectacle was\r\noffered of the government prohibiting one theatre, at a great loss, from\r\nplaying the very same piece which next day it offered another theatre\r\ntwenty thousand dollars for playing in Italian! The _Eclipse_\r\nsatirically suggests that the secret must be that \"entrer par la\r\nfenêtre\" becomes harmless as _entrare per la finestra_, and \"donner la\r\nmain\" is innocent as \"_donare la mano_\" and that Italian purifies\r\neverything. If this be so, could not the Paris journalists borrow a\r\nuseful hint from the affair, and avoid suspension by the government\r\nthrough the simple device of turning into Italian verses, of the\r\noperatic sort, those passages of the editorial articles which if printed\r\nin French would provoke the censor's ire?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the recent disgraceful squabble and riot of the monks around\r\nJerusalem there was one incident that should especially pain all lovers\r\nof art. This was the destruction of the two pictures by Murillo in the\r\nBethlehem church that fell a victim to ecclesiastical fury. They were\r\ntrue Murillos, and masterpieces; and, what is worse, having been\r\ndespatched to the church immediately on their execution, and there\r\nretained, it is believed that they have never been engraved. They were\r\nunusually well preserved, too, for, on being placed in the oratory of La\r\nCrèche, both canvases had been covered with glass to protect them from\r\ncandle-smoke. One of the subjects was the Nativity, the other the\r\nAdoration of the Magi. In reading with involuntary indignation and\r\ndisgust of this barbarous instance of iconoclasm, one is reminded of\r\nwhat Thackeray wrote on the same scene and topic nearly thirty years\r\nago. In his _Journey from Cornhill to Cairo_, speaking of the leading\r\nChristian sects in and around Jerusalem, he says: \"These three main\r\nsects hate each other; their quarrels are interminable; each bribes and\r\nintrigues with the heathen lords of the soil to the prejudice of his\r\nneighbor. Now it is the Latins who interfere, and allow the common\r\nchurch to go to ruin, because the Greeks purpose to roof it; now the\r\nGreeks demolish a monastery on Mount Olivet, and leave the ground to the\r\nTurks, rather than allow the Armenians to possess it. On another\r\noccasion, the Greeks having mended the Armenian steps which lead to the\r\n(so-called) Cave of the Nativity at Bethlehem, the latter asked for\r\npermission to destroy the work of the Greeks, and did so. And so round\r\nthis sacred spot, the centre of Christendom, the representatives of the\r\nthree great sects worship under one roof, and hate each other!\" The\r\nchurch of La Crèche is, as its name implies, the church of \"The Manger\"\r\n(_i. e._, the reputed place of the nativity of Christ); and to this\r\nspot, and the furious wrangles of which it has been the scene, we may\r\ntherefore apply the exclamation which Thackeray makes regarding the tomb\r\nof Christ: \"What a place to choose for imposture, good God!--to sully\r\nwith brutal struggles for self-aggrandizement or shameful schemes of\r\ngain!\" The Germans had the grace to try to spare with their bombs the\r\nspire of Strasburg cathedral; religious fanaticism in the Middle Ages\r\ndirected itself to the destruction of \"pagan\" art, no matter how\r\nbeautiful; but in these enlightened days for ecclesiastical fury to take\r\nup the barbarous _rôle_ of destruction, which even savage war discards,\r\nis pitiable indeed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nComeliness becomes every day more and more an affair of chemistry.\r\nScience has now found what bids fair to be a very \"glass of\r\nfashion\"--not a metaphorical, but a literal glass, at least for lean\r\npeople. The chemical properties of each color in the solar spectrum have\r\nlong been known, and of late years it has also been discovered that\r\nplants may be made to thrive wonderfully in green-houses constructed of\r\nblue or violet panes, the production of such nurseries being sometimes\r\ndoubled or trebled by this device. But the experiment has been pushed\r\nfurther, for some English chemists maintain that rooms provided with\r\nviolet windows, or even with hangings of that color, will fatten the\r\noccupants! Shakespeare's \"glass wherein the noble youth did dress\r\nthemselves\" was not so practical a possession as this. Surely, hereafter\r\nthose who would divest themselves of their lean and hungry look may grow\r\nobese at will, and turn the scale at the very pound required; and this,\r\ntoo, by no such regimen as the Oriental one of rice and indolence, but\r\nmerely by passing a season under a violet dome or a blue crystal\r\ngreen-house. Such a remedy is good tidings for all the wan, the haggard\r\nand the wizened of society, and for those \"whom sharp misery has worn to\r\nthe bone.\" Henceforth there need be no \"starvelings,\" \"elf-skins\" or\r\n\"dried neat's tongues\" of leanness for the Falstaffs to mock. And the\r\nfat men, too, the \"huge hills of flesh,\" shall they not have their\r\ncomplementary color in their windows to make them thin? Let the\r\ncompassionate Bantings look to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nA Simpleton: A Story of the Day. By Charles Reade. New York: Harper &\r\nBrothers.\r\n\r\nIn a preface to the English edition of this book Mr. Reade grapples with\r\nthe charge of plagiarism so often urged against his stories, and,\r\njustifying his habitual course by precedents, forestalls the search of\r\nthe detectives in the present case by proclaiming the sources from which\r\nincidents and descriptions have been gathered. Having treated of many\r\nmatters beyond the range of his personal knowledge and experience, he\r\nhas necessarily had recourse to the writings of other men, and by citing\r\nhis authorities he not only clears himself of the suspicion of\r\nsurreptitious borrowing, but establishes the truthfulness, or at least\r\nthe plausibility, of what might otherwise have been considered\r\nimprobable inventions. This frankness, which, after all, sheds no new\r\nlight upon his method of composition, seems to have had the happy, if\r\nundesigned, effect of throwing his critics off the true scent. The real\r\nplagiarism in _A Simpleton_ lies not in the details, but in the\r\nconception. The \"situation\" which leads to all the embroilments and\r\ndevelopments is the apparently ill-assorted union of a man of science\r\nand genius, absorbed in the labors of investigation and discovery,\r\npractical in his views of life and upright in all his actions, with an\r\nill-trained and unintellectual beauty, whose perfections of form and\r\nface, pretty coquetry, studied artlessness and sweet recognition of the\r\nvalue of masculine knowledge and strength as the proper stay of feminine\r\nweakness and the proper organ of the feminine will, assail the superior\r\nbeing just at that point where his perceptions are weakest, and lead him\r\nan easy captive. When we add that this Samson is a young medical man,\r\nmarked out for the highest honors of his profession, and that his career\r\nis temporarily blighted at the outset through the extravagance,\r\nsilliness and deception of his wife, we have given an outline which no\r\nreader of _Middlemarch_ will require to have paralleled. Dr. Christopher\r\nStaines is matched and contrasted with Rosa Lusignan, precisely as\r\nLydgate is matched and contrasted with Rosamond Vincy. There is even a\r\nfurther resemblance in the minor pairing and natural dissonance of Phebe\r\nDale and Reginald Falcon in the one book and of Mary Garth and Fred\r\nVincy in its predecessor; while Lady Cicely Treherne, though her\r\nsimplicity, unlike that of Dorothea, is merely assumed, is almost as\r\nunworldly as that heroine, makes a similar use of her wealth and social\r\nadvantages, stands in much the same relation to the other characters,\r\nserves them in the same manner, and ends by marrying her Will Ladislaw\r\nunder the designation of a \"mercurial Irish gentleman\" not further\r\nintroduced to the reader. It will be understood that it is not the\r\ncharacters, in the proper sense of the word, that Mr. Reade has\r\nborrowed. In fact, George Eliot's characters are too intimately\r\nassociated with their surroundings, the circumstances in which they are\r\nplaced enter too largely as elements into their nature, to allow of\r\ntheir being transplanted without losing all identity. And on the other\r\nhand, Mr. Reade, for a reason to be mentioned hereafter, is quite\r\nincapable of borrowing characters--still using the word in its most\r\nrigid meaning: the characters in his books are always in an emphatic\r\nsense his own. The plot, too, and the action of the one book, bear as\r\nlittle resemblance to those of the other as an exhibition of fireworks\r\nbears to the \"after-glow\" of an Alpine sunset. It is, as we have said,\r\nthe \"situation\" which Mr. Reade has taken, and this with a palpable\r\npurpose, as if, after reading _Middlemarch_, he had said: \"Ha! here is a\r\ngood idea; but George Eliot, with her commonplace, humdrum way of\r\ntreating things, has missed the effects of which it was capable. I,\r\nCharles Reade, who see beneath the surface, besides being a master of\r\npyrotechnics, will work up the theme in that flashing, whizzing,\r\nstartling, dazzling way which shall reveal its full proportions as well\r\nas my own transcendent powers.\" Accordingly, while Rosamond continues to\r\nbe Rosamond throughout, each fresh exhibition of her traits only showing\r\ntheir natural growth or furthering the reader's knowledge of them, Rosa\r\npasses through the swift transformations which a \"Hey, presto!\" is quite\r\nsufficient to announce. In the early part of the book she is an\r\nembodiment of silliness, levity and selfishness--in the latter part she\r\nis reason, self-devotion and passionate love personified. As for Dr.\r\nStaines, there is no need of any apotheosis in his case: as the hero of\r\nthe book he must perforce be that renowned prestidigitateur whom Mr.\r\nReade long since presented to an admiring audience as the principal\r\nperformer in his troupe. It is needless, therefore, to say that he goes\r\nthrough the programme with the highest dexterity and éclat, displaying\r\nthe marvelous knowledge, encountering the terrific dangers, achieving\r\nthe prodigies which belong to his part, without the least falling off in\r\nvivacity or suppleness. When he finally hurls his treacherous friend\r\nfrom a cottage window and impales him on the garden railings, who can\r\nwithhold the well-merited applause?\r\n\r\nIt may seem paradoxical to say of a very successful novel-writer that he\r\nhas mistaken his vocation, yet such, we think, is Mr. Reade's case. For\r\nthe novelist, as for the dramatist, an essential combination is that of\r\na strong individuality with an equal endowment of the imitative faculty.\r\nThis union is found, perhaps, in its perfection only in Shakespeare.\r\nShakespeare's personages bear the double stamp of their own\r\nindividuality and of their creator's. In their appropriate diversity\r\ntheir origin is still apparent. Their fidelity to Nature is never that\r\nof literal copies. When Lear says, \"Undo this button,\" we are thrilled\r\nwith the reality of the trait, but we do not suspect it of having been\r\nborrowed from real life. On the contrary, it glows with the heat of that\r\nimaginative power whose office it is to transfuse reality--to seize\r\ntruth in its essence and idealize it in form. Descending to two writers\r\nin whom this combination is also strong, we may notice how,\r\nnevertheless, the balance inclines to one side or the other. There are\r\nmany passages of Jane Austen which read like transcripts of actual\r\nconversations: one might suppose them to have been done by a skillful\r\nreporter. In George Eliot's books, on the other hand, the spontaneity of\r\nthe actors is checked by the brooding, analytical spirit of the author:\r\ntheir verisimilitude is perfect, but their dramatic capabilities do not\r\nalways have the free play necessary to their complete exhibition and\r\nappropriate effect. Turning now to Mr. Reade, we find that in him one\r\nelement of this combination--the power of impersonation--is utterly\r\nlacking. His own individuality protrudes itself at every point. His\r\ncharacters are all identical in essence--all imbued with the confidence,\r\nthe unflagging ardor, the impetuosity and extravagance of the same\r\nideal. It is in vain that he labels them with different designations: no\r\nsooner do they begin to speak and move than every tone and gesture\r\nreveals the familiar type. The poor, mean-spirited creature intended to\r\ncontrast with the hero turns out to be only his pale reflection.\r\nDistinctions of sex and age, of race and education, are merely\r\nsuperficial. High or low, good or bad, they are all equally knowing and\r\nequally self-willed. The women may talk of bonnets, but their lofty and\r\nfiery souls glow through the twaddle. The children have an infantile\r\nprattle, but the schoolmaster, overhearing it, would at once remark that\r\nit was only _that boy Reade_ holding one of his strange colloquies with\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWith this incapacity to understand the diverse springs of human action,\r\nMr. Reade is clearly no novelist in the true sense of the term. He is,\r\nhowever, an admirable describer and a capital story-teller. He is\r\nconsequently always entertaining and secure of his reader. Yet, inasmuch\r\nas he professes to relate and describe only actual facts, we cannot but\r\nregret that he should have adopted a form which is ill suited to this\r\nobject, and which makes him a mere retailer of other people's\r\nobservations. In the book before us he paints the interior of Africa\r\nfrom somebody else's information: had he gone thither himself his\r\npicture would have had great value. So, too, he is continually\r\ninstructing us about the processes used in the arts and manufactures;\r\nbut his knowledge being gained at second hand and crammed for the\r\noccasion, we mistrust the teacher. If he would apply himself to such\r\nmatters, and give us the results of his experience, our gain would be\r\ngreat. He could not, of course, as now, traverse the whole field; but\r\nwhat his teaching might lose in superficial extent would be more than\r\nmade good by its greater accuracy and reliability. He might select, for\r\ninstance, the useful art of coopering. We know his powers, we appreciate\r\nhis genius. It is safe to say that a cask made in accordance with his\r\ndirections, after he had served a short apprenticeship, would not only\r\nbe fair to see and easy to handle, but would also hold water. This is\r\nmore than we should venture to affirm of the plot of any of his novels.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fishing Tourist. By Charles Hallock. New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nI Go A-Fishing. By W. C. Prime. New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nMr. Hallock tells us in his preface that his province is to write an\r\nanglers' guide without embellishment. It would have been well if he had\r\nadhered to this plan. After some pages of high-flown periods he informs\r\nus that twenty-six years ago fly-fishing was in its infancy, being\r\nscarcely known in America, and but little practiced in England. If he\r\nhad asserted that fly-fishing was scarcely known among his \"green hills\"\r\nat that period, and but little practiced in Hampshire county, the\r\nstatement need not have been impugned; but hundreds of books have been\r\nwritten upon this art in England since the time of Dame Juliana Berners,\r\nand in America fifty years ago there existed many such practitioners as\r\nFay, Eckley and Bethune.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hallock treats of the natural history of his favorite fishes he\r\nis equally unfortunate; which is the less remarkable since he gets his\r\nscience from W. H. Herbert, a writer who knew little of American\r\nichthyology. As a specimen of the methods of that \"cautious student,\" as\r\nour author calls him, Herbert, pretending to quote from Agassiz, who in\r\nhis _Tour to Lake Superior_ described a new salmon of that lake under\r\nthe name of _Salmo Siskowet_, calls it _Salmo Siskowitz_, and this\r\nmistake Hallock repeats. Again, Herbert writing of the great northern\r\npickerel, calls it \"_Esox lucioides_, Agassiz;\" the fact being that\r\nProfessor Agassiz describes it in his _Lake Superior_ as _Esox boreas_.\r\nThis mistake of Herbert has been perpetuated by most of the popular\r\nwriters, Norris, Roosevelt, etc. Mr. Hallock calls the sea-trout _Salmo\r\ntrutta_, again copying Herbert, while all naturalists now give it the\r\nname bestowed upon it by Hamilton Smith, _Salmo Canadensis_, it being\r\nvery distinct from _Salmo trutta_, which is a European species. Mr.\r\nHallock writes of the \"toag of Lakes Pepin, Moosehead and St. Croix.\"\r\nNow, Lake Pepin contains no large gray trout; in fact, with the\r\nexception of _Salmo fontinalis_, its fishes are all of the Western type.\r\nHe also mentions \"the common lake-trout of New York and New England,\r\n_Salmo confinis_, DeKay,\" which is identical with the toag, just\r\nmentioned. Dr. A. L. Adams of the British army, in a recent work on the\r\n_Natural History of New Brunswick_, calls it \"the togue or toladi,\r\n_Salmo confinis_, DeKay, the gray-spotted lake-trout.\" Mr. Hallock\r\nasserts that _Salmo Sebago_ is a monster brook-trout, like those of the\r\nRangely lakes. Dr. Adams states that this name, _Salmo Sebago_, was\r\napplied to the Schoodic salmon, _Salmo Gloveri_, by Girard, in 1853; the\r\nspecies being first observed in that lake, where it is now said to be\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nAs a guide-book, _The Fishing Tourist_ is not without value, for a work\r\non this plan was needed. An unfortunate spirit of exaggeration seems,\r\nhowever, to pervade the narrative. What remarkable good luck a man must\r\nhave who kills a four-pound trout at Bartlett's! How fortunate is he who\r\ncan make an average of two-pound trout in a New Hampshire river! Our\r\nexperience teaches us that it is dangerous to guarantee that no trout\r\nunder ten ounces will be found in the Tabasintoc, though one might say\r\nthat of the Novelle, another New Brunswick river. When Mr. Hallock\r\nstates that the trout in the \"Big Woods\" of Wisconsin are lamentably\r\nignorant of the angler's wiles, he must be referring to a remote period:\r\nwe find them now very wide awake, and meet almost as many anglers on\r\nRush River as on the Raquette.\r\n\r\nMr. Prime's book is a very pleasant one. Evidently the work of a\r\nscholar, it indulges in none of those spasmodic efforts of eloquence\r\nwhich are the joy of the newspaper correspondent. Perhaps there is\r\nsomething too much of the Iskander Effendi and the Sea of Galilee to be\r\ncongruous with the St. Regis and Franconia Notch, but the dialogue is\r\nnatural, the fishing adventures are painted with a modest brush, the\r\ntrout are not incredibly large or numerous, and the whole tone of the\r\nbook is well suited to summer reading, when, on your return from a long\r\ntramp by the river-side, you wish to take your ease in the society of a\r\nsympathizing author. Mr. Prime treats of well-known resorts, the\r\nmuch-whipped St. Regis lakes and the depleted streams of Connecticut and\r\nNew Hampshire, but even among these familiar scenes he is able to find\r\nsomething new, or at least they are described in a fresh and lively way.\r\nThe book is worthy to rest on the same shelf with Walton, Davy, Wilson,\r\nand the other classics of the angler's library. There are some sketches\r\nof fly-fishing in European waters which will be interesting to American\r\nanglers, and there is much pleasant talk about old books.\r\n\r\n\r\nLombard Street: A Description of the Money Market. By Walter Bagehot.\r\nNew York: Scribner, Armstrong & Co.\r\n\r\nIn England, as in America, notes are a legal tender, the Bank of England\r\nnotes corresponding in that respect to our greenbacks. An American\r\nbanker is safe if he have enough greenbacks to pay all probable demands,\r\nthough the value of these changes as our government chooses to enlarge\r\nor contract the issue. The number of attainable bank-notes is not so\r\nelastic, however, in England as with us: the issue department of the\r\nBank of England is limited, by an act of Parliament passed in 1844, to\r\nfifteen millions of pounds. For the last few years that bank, in\r\naddition to its fifteen millions in notes, has retained something like\r\ntwenty millions in coin. It has not uniformly, though, been so rich:\r\nthree times since 1847 its banking department has been reduced to a\r\nfigure of three million pounds or under. On these occasions \"Peel's Act\"\r\nhas been suspended to tide over the affairs of the embarrassed bank, and\r\nits business could not have survived if the law had not been broken. The\r\nbank which has thus three times practically given out in a quarter of a\r\ncentury is, however, so thoroughly protected by prestige, by national\r\nand international confidence, that it is the custodian of the reserves\r\nbelonging to all Lombard street and to all the country banks of England,\r\nas well as those of Scotch and Irish bankers. And \"since the\r\nFranco-German war,\" says Mr. Bagehot, \"we may be said to keep the\r\nEuropean reserve also.\" All great communities have at times to pay large\r\nsums in cash, and of that cash a great store must be kept somewhere.\r\nFormerly, there were two such stores in Europe: one was the Bank of\r\nFrance, and the other the Bank of England. But since the suspension of\r\nspecie payments by the Bank of France its use as a reservoir of specie\r\nis at an end: no one can draw a cheque on it and be sure of getting gold\r\nfor it. Accordingly, the whole liability for such international payments\r\nin cash is thrown on the Bank of England. The accumulations secured\r\nultimately by this bank represent a remarkable share of the national\r\nwealth. England is the only European country where small savers commit\r\ntheir money to custody: France has never recovered from the timidity\r\nconsequent on Law's failure, and still hoards its petty sums in\r\nstockings; Holland and Germany have never felt secure from invasion.\r\nEngland alone trusts its whole gain to a bank, and demands interest for\r\nit. The vast amount of idle gold distributed through the homes of France\r\nand Germany is not tangible, is not money \"of the money market.\" The\r\nhoards of France can only be tempted from their torpor by a vast\r\nnational misfortune and by a great loan in French securities. But the\r\nEnglish money is borrowable money. The British are bold lenders, and\r\neven if they were not so, the mere fact that their money lies in a bank\r\nmakes it far more obtainable. Millions in the hand of a banker are a\r\npower, whereas distributed through a nation they cannot be asked for,\r\nand are no power at all. It is thus that Lombard street stands ready to\r\nlend to all civilized or partly civilized governments at different\r\nrates, and builds railways in indigent states all over the world. For,\r\nthough \"English bankers are not themselves very great lenders to foreign\r\ncountries, they are great lenders to those who lend.\" Rude and poor\r\ncountries and undeveloped! colonies find in Lombard street a fund into\r\nwhich they may dip at a suitable premium, and thus possess a chance of\r\nmaterial felicity which was never the privilege of any previous epoch.\r\nThis vast machine, however, the legacy of unnumbered years, is not an\r\nideally perfect custodian of the wealth entrusted to it. The reforms\r\ncalled for by a long experience are what the most important part of Mr.\r\nBagehot's volume is devoted to. Some permanent and skilled authority to\r\nrule the bank is the principal novelty suggested; but the French plan\r\nwill not do for England. The direct appointment of a governor by the\r\nCrown would not lessen the difficulty. The American law, saying that\r\neach national bank shall have a fixed proportion of cash to its\r\nliabilities, Mr. Bagehot considers one of many reforms which the English\r\ncould not adopt if they would: \"in a sensitive state of the British\r\nmoney-market the near approach to the legal limit of reserve would be a\r\nsure incentive to panic.\" The difficulties of remodeling such an\r\ninstitution as the Bank of England are the most curiously developed\r\nportion of Mr. Bagehot's treatise, where all is curiously and\r\nintelligently handled. The book is interesting to outsiders as well as\r\nto professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\nWau-Ban: The Early Day in the North-west. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott\r\n& Co.\r\n\r\nThis is a reprint, in a condensed and convenient form, of a work written\r\nsome twenty years ago by Mrs. John H. Kinzie of Chicago. It is a real\r\ncontribution to the early history of the North-west, and contains enough\r\nof romantic adventure to form the basis of half a dozen novels. The\r\nstory of the massacre of Chicago in 1812 is one of the most thrilling in\r\nAmerican history, and it is here told by an eye-witness. Still, it is\r\ndifficult to realize that sixty years ago a wagon-load of children were\r\ntomahawked by Indians in what is now the heart of the great City of the\r\nLakes.\r\n\r\nThe family of Kinzie had certainly a remarkable history, beginning with\r\nthe female ancestor who was captured by savages in the early history of\r\nthe country, through that generation who were the founders of Chicago,\r\ndown to the living representative of the family, who in 1830 entered one\r\nhundred and sixty acres of the present town at the government price, one\r\ndollar and twenty-five cents per acre, and only paid for one hundred,\r\nthinking, as he said, that that quantity of land would be all he should\r\never want or could find a use for. The rejected portion is now worth\r\nfrom two to three millions of dollars. A hundred years hence, when\r\nChicago will perhaps contain a million or two of inhabitants, the name\r\nof this family of pioneers will be as memorable as that of Winthrop in\r\nBoston or Stuyvesant in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Books Received._\r\n\r\n\r\nDe Witt's Acting Plays: No. 142.
